Lincoln F. Brigham, John\r\nD. Philbrick, Esq., Dr. Jabez B. Upham, Hon. Harvey Jewell, and Hon.\r\nWalbridge A. Field, who have aided in a similar manner. Particular\r\nmention should also be made of the kindness of gentlemen connected\r\nwith numerous libraries, especially that of Mr. John Ward Deane, and\r\nMr. Albert H. Hoyt, and the late J. Wingate Thornton, Esq., of the New\r\nEngland Historic-Genealogical Society, by whose kindness the writer\r\nwas furnished with the valuable letter from David McClure to General\r\nKnox, and Rev. Alonzo H. Quint, D.D., and Dr. Samuel A. Green, of the\r\nMassachusetts Historical Society, to whom he is indebted for the\r\ninvaluable list of English donations given in the Appendix. Valuable\r\naid has been rendered also by Messrs. Kimball and Secor, of the New\r\nHampshire State and State Historical Society Libraries, at Concord. In\r\nthis connection the well known names of W.

Gilman, Esq., and others representing the\r\nfamily of the founder, of the family of Hon. Elisha Payne, an early\r\nand honored Trustee, of the Trustees and Faculty of the college, and\r\nthe courteous liberality of the publishers.\r\n\r\nBAXTER P.

The well-directed, patient, and successful labors\r\nof the Eliots, Cotton, and the Mayhews, and the scarcely less valuable\r\nlabors of Treat and others, fill a bright page in the religious\r\nhistory of the seventeenth century. To numerous congregations of red\r\nmen the gospel was preached; many were converted; churches were\r\ngathered, and the whole Bible--the first printed in America--was given\r\nthem in their own language.\r\n\r\nThis interest in the Indian was not confined to our own country, in\r\nthe earlier periods of our history. In Great Britain, sovereigns,\r\necclesiastics, and philosophers recognized the obligations\r\nprovidentially imposed upon them, to aid in giving a Christian\r\ncivilization to their swarthy brethren, who were sitting in the\r\nthickest darkness of heathenism in the primeval forests of the New\r\nWorld. Societies, as well as individuals, manifested a deep and\r\npractical interest in the work.\r\n\r\nWe can only touch upon some of the more salient points of this\r\nsubject. But it is especially worthy of note, that the elevation of\r\nthe Indian race, by the education of its youth, was not an idea of New\r\nEngland, nor indeed of American, birth.\r\n\r\nIn Stith's \"History of Virginia\" (p. 162), we find in substance the\r\nfollowing statements: At an early period in the history of this State,\r\nattempts were made to establish an institution of learning of a high\r\norder. In 1619, the treasurer of the Virginia Company, Sir Edwin\r\nSandys, received from an unknown hand five hundred pounds, to be\r\napplied by the Company to the education of a certain number of Indian\r\nyouths in the English language and in the Christian religion. Other\r\nsums of money were also procured, and there was a prospect of being\r\nable to raise four or five thousand pounds, for the endowment of a\r\ncollege. The king favored the design, and recommended to the bishops\r\nto have collections made in their dioceses, and some fifteen hundred\r\npounds were gathered on this recommendation. The college was designed\r\nfor the instruction of English, as well as Indian, youths. The Company\r\nappropriated ten thousand acres of land to this purpose, at Henrico,\r\non James River, a little below the present site of Richmond. The plan\r\nof the college was, to place tenants at halves on these lands, and to\r\nderive its income from the profits. The enterprise was abandoned in\r\nconsequence of the great Indian massacre, in 1622, although operations\r\nhad been commenced, and a competent person had been secured to act as\r\npresident. This is believed to have been the first effort to found a\r\ncollege in America.\r\n\r\nPassing to the middle of the century, we find the distinguished\r\nChristian philosopher, Robert Boyle, appointed governor of \"a company\r\nincorporated for the propagation of the gospel among the heathen\r\nnatives of New England, and the parts adjacent in America,\" and that,\r\nafter his decease, in 1691, a portion of his estate was given, by the\r\nexecutors of his will, to William and Mary's College, which was\r\npossibly, in a measure, the outgrowth of the efforts of Mr. Sandys and\r\nhis coadjutors, for the support of Indian students.\r\n\r\nIn 1728, Col. William Byrd, in writing upon this subject, laments \"the\r\nbad success Mr. Boyle's charity has had in converting the natives,\"\r\nwhich was owing in part, at least, to the fact, that the interest of\r\ntheir white brethren in their welfare was confined chiefly to their\r\nresidence at college.\r\n\r\nPursuing these researches, we come to the name of another\r\ndistinguished British scholar and divine, George Berkeley, who has\r\nbeen styled \"the philosopher\" of the reign of George II.\r\n\r\nWe quote a portion of a letter relating to his educational plans, from\r\nDean Swift to Lord Carteret, Lieutenant of Ireland, dated Sept. 3,\r\n1724, in which he says:\r\n\r\n\"He showed me a little tract which he designs to publish, and\r\nthere your Excellency will see his whole scheme of a life\r\nacademico-philosophic, of a college at Bermuda for Indian scholars and\r\nmissionaries. I discourage him by the coldness of courts and\r\nministers, who will interpret all this as impossible and a vision, but\r\nnothing will do. And therefore I do humbly entreat your Excellency\r\neither to use such persuasions as will keep one of the first men in\r\nthis kingdom for learning and virtue quiet at home, or assist him by\r\nyour credit to compass his romantic design, which, however, is very\r\nnoble and generous, and directly proper for a great person of your\r\nexcellent education to encourage.\"\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet alluded to begins, as one of his biographers informs us,\r\nby lamenting \"that there is at this day little sense of religion and a\r\nmost notorious corruption of manners in the English colonies settled\r\non the continent of America, and the islands,\" and that \"the Gospel\r\nhath hitherto made but very inconsiderable progress among the\r\nneighboring Americans, who still continue in much the same ignorance\r\nand barbarism in which we found them above a hundred years ago.\" After\r\nstating what he believes to be the causes of this state of things, he\r\npropounds his plan of training young natives, as missionaries to their\r\ncountrymen, and educating \"the youth of our English plantations,\" to\r\nfill the pulpits of the colonial churches. His biographer is\r\ndoubtless correct in the opinion, that \"it was on the savages,\r\nevidently, that he had his heart.\"\r\n\r\nHe obtained a charter from the crown for his proposed college, and a\r\npromise, never fulfilled, of large pecuniary aid from the government,\r\nand early in 1729 he arrived in America, settling temporarily at\r\nNewport, R. I. Failing to accomplish his purpose, he remained in this\r\ncountry but two or three years, yet long enough to form the\r\nacquaintance of many eminent men, and among them President Williams,\r\nof Yale College.\r\n\r\nFinding that there was no prospect of receiving the promised aid for\r\nhis college, Berkeley returned to England in 1731. Soon after, in\r\naddition to a large and valuable donation of books for the library, he\r\nsent as a gift, to Yale, a deed of his farm in Rhode Island, the rents\r\nof which he directed to be appropriated to the maintenance or aid of\r\nmeritorious resident graduates or under-graduates.\r\n\r\nAlthough he failed to carry out his plan of establishing a college\r\nhimself, in America, perhaps he \"builded better than he knew.\" Most\r\nfitting is it, as we shall see hereafter, for the current literature\r\nof our day to place in intimate association, the names of Boyle,\r\nBerkeley, and Dartmouth.\r\n\r\nPassing to 1734, we find Rev. John Sergeant commencing missionary\r\nlabor among the Indians at Stockbridge, Mass. After a trial of a few\r\nyears, he writes in a manner showing very plainly that he believes\r\ncivilization essential to any permanent success. In one of his letters\r\nto Rev. Dr. Colman, of Boston, he says: \"What I propose, in general,\r\nis, to take such a method in the education of our Indian children as\r\nshall in the most effectual manner change their whole manner of\r\nthinking and acting, and raise them as far as possible into the\r\ncondition of a civil, industrious, and polished people, while at the\r\nsame time the principles of virtue and piety shall be instilled into\r\ntheir minds in a way that will make the most lasting impression, and\r\nwithal to introduce the English language among them instead of their\r\nown barbarous dialect.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now to accomplish this design, I propose to procure an\r\naccommodation of 200 acres of land in this place (which may be had\r\ngratis of the Indian proprietors), and to erect a house on it such as\r\nshall be thought convenient for a beginning, and in it to maintain a\r\nnumber of children and youth.\" He proposes \"to have their time so\r\ndivided between study and labor that one shall be the diversion of the\r\nother, so that as little time as possible may be lost in idleness,\"\r\nand, \"to take into the number, upon certain conditions, youths from\r\nany of the other tribes around.\" His plan included both sexes. Mr.\r\nSergeant died in 1749. Besides accomplishing much himself, he laid the\r\nfoundations for the subsequent labors of Jonathan Edwards.\r\n\r\nThis rapid glance at the earlier efforts in behalf of the Aborigines\r\nof our country, shows that the next actor upon the stage, undaunted by\r\nany lack of success on their part, measurably followed in the\r\nfootsteps of learned and philanthropic predecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nANCESTRY AND EARLY LIFE OF ELEAZAR WHEELOCK.--HIS SETTLEMENT AT\r\nLEBANON, CONN.--ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INDIAN CHARITY SCHOOL.--MR.\r\nJOSHUA MORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEleazar Wheelock, the leading founder of Dartmouth College, was a\r\ngreat-grandson of Ralph Wheelock, a native of Shropshire, in England,\r\nthrough whom Dartmouth traces her academic ancestry to the ancient and\r\nvenerable Clare Hall, at Cambridge, where he graduated in 1626, the\r\ncontemporary of Thomas Dudley, Samuel Eaton, John Milton, John Norton,\r\nThomas Shepard, and Samuel Stone.\r\n\r\nComing a few years later to this country, he became a useful and an\r\nhonored citizen of the then new, but now old, historic town of Dedham,\r\nfrom which place he removed to Medfield, being styled \"founder\" of\r\nthat town, where he remained till his death. He devoted his time\r\nlargely to teaching, although, having been educated for the ministry,\r\nhe rendered valuable service to the infant community as an occasional\r\npreacher. His name is also conspicuous among the magistrates and\r\nlegislators of that period.[1]\r\n\r\n      [1] His daughter Rebecca married John Craft, whose birth is the\r\n          earliest on record among the pioneer settlers at Roxbury. Some\r\n          of his descendants (by another marriage) are conspicuous in\r\n          history. Medfield records connect the names of Fuller,\r\n          Chenery, and Morse with the Wheelock family.\r\n\r\nIn the character of his son, Eleazar Wheelock, of Mendon, we are told\r\nthere was a union of \"the Christian and the soldier.\" Having command\r\nof a corps of cavalry, he was \"very successful in repelling the\r\nirruptions of the Indians,\" although he treated them with \"great\r\nkindness,\" in times of peace. From him, his grandson and namesake\r\nreceived \"a handsome legacy for defraying the expenses of his public\r\neducation,\" and from him, too, he doubtless acquired, in some\r\nmeasure, that peculiar interest in the Indian race which so largely\r\nmoulded his character and guided the labors of his life.\r\n\r\nNear the time of Ralph Wheelock's arrival in America, were two other\r\narrivals worthy of notice: that of Thomas Hooker, at Cambridge, \"the\r\none rich pearl with which Europe more than repaid America for the\r\ntreasures from her coasts,\" and that of the widowed Margaret\r\nHuntington, at Roxbury, of which there is still a well-preserved\r\nrecord, in the handwriting of John Eliot. The guiding and controlling\r\ninfluence of Hooker's masterly mind upon all, whether laymen or\r\ndivines, with whom he came in contact, must be apparent to those who\r\nare familiar with the biography of one, to whom the learned and\r\nreligious institutions of New England are more indebted, perhaps, than\r\nto any other single person. Hooker's settlement at Hartford is fitly\r\nstyled \"the founding of Connecticut.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a little later the family of Margaret Huntington settled at\r\nSaybrook, their youthful pastor, who was just gathering a church, was\r\nJames Fitch, a worthy pupil of Thomas Hooker. Not satisfied with their\r\nlocation, pastor and people sought an inland home, and in 1660 laid\r\nthe foundations of what is now the large and flourishing town of\r\nNorwich. From this time Huntington and Fitch are honored names in the\r\nhistory of Connecticut.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century after the settlement of Norwich, an English\r\nrefugee from religious oppression began the settlement of the\r\nneighboring town of Windham. To this place, Ralph Wheelock the\r\nyounger, a grandson of the Dedham teacher and preacher, was attracted,\r\nmarrying about the same time, Ruth, daughter of Dea. Christopher\r\nHuntington, of Norwich. Mr. Ralph Wheelock was a respectable farmer,\r\nuniversally esteemed for his hospitality, his piety, and the virtues\r\nthat adorn the Christian character, and in his later years was an\r\nofficer of the church.\r\n\r\nOf Mrs. Wheelock, it is said:[2] \"Every tradition respecting her makes\r\nher a woman of unusual intelligence and rare piety. Her home, the main\r\ntheatre of her life, was blessed equally by her timely instructions,\r\nher holy example, and the administration of a gentle yet firm\r\ndiscipline.\" Their son Eleazar was born at Windham, April 22, 1711.\r\n\r\n      [2] Huntington Family Memoir, p. 78.\r\n\r\nThe first minister of this honored town was Rev. Samuel Whiting, a\r\nnative of Hartford, and trained in the \"Hooker School.\" For a helpmeet\r\nhe had secured a lineal descendant of that noble and revered puritan,\r\nGov. Wm. Bradford. The labors of this worthy pair were largely blessed\r\nto their people. At one period, in a population of hundreds, it is\r\nsaid \"the town did not contain a single prayerless family.\"\r\n\r\nThus kindly and wisely did the Master arrange, by long and closely\r\nblended lines of events, that the most genial influences should\r\nsurround the cradle of one for whom He designed eminent service and\r\npeculiar honor.\r\n\r\nThe mother of Eleazar Wheelock having died in 1725, for a second wife\r\nhis father married a lady named Standish, a descendant of Myles\r\nStandish, whose heroic character she perhaps impressed, in some\r\nmeasure, upon her adopted son. \"Being an only son,\" says his\r\nbiographer,[3] \"and discovering, at an early age, a lively genius, a\r\ntaste for learning, with a very amiable disposition, he was placed by\r\nhis father under the best instructors that could then be obtained.\" At\r\n\"about the age of sixteen, while qualifying himself for admission to\r\ncollege, it pleased God to impress his mind with serious concern for\r\nhis salvation. After earnest, prayerful inquiry, he was enlightened\r\nand comforted with that hope in the Saviour, which afterwards proved\r\nthe animating spring of his abundant labors to promote the best\r\ninterests of mankind.\" At the time of his admission to the Windham\r\nchurch, the distinguished Thomas Clap was its pastor.\r\n\r\n      [3] Memoirs of Wheelock, by McClure and Parish.\r\n\r\nHaving made the requisite preparation, he entered Yale College, of\r\nwhich President Williams was then at the head, \"with a resolution to\r\ndevote himself to the work of the Gospel ministry.\" Among his college\r\ncontemporaries were Joseph Bellamy and President Aaron Burr.\r\n\r\n\"His proficiency in study, and his exemplary deportment, engaged the\r\nnotice and esteem of the rector and instructors, and the love of the\r\nstudents. He and his future brother-in-law, the late Rev. Doctor\r\nPomeroy of Hebron, in Connecticut, were the first who received the\r\ninterest of the legacy, generously given by the Rev. Dean Berkeley,\"\r\nfor excellence in classical scholarship.\r\n\r\nSoon after his graduation, in 1733, he commenced preaching. Having\r\ndeclined a call from Long Island, to settle in the ministry, he\r\naccepted a unanimous invitation from the Second Congregational Society\r\nin Lebanon, Connecticut, and was ordained in June, 1735.\r\n\r\nThis town occupies a conspicuous place in American history; for,\r\nwhoever traces the lineage of some of the most illustrious names that\r\ngrace its pages, finds his path lying to or through this \"valley of\r\ncedars,\" in Eastern Connecticut. Here the patient, heroic Huguenot\r\naided in laying foundations for all good institutions. Here the\r\nlearned, indefatigable Tisdale taught with distinguished success. Here\r\nlived those eminent patriots, the Trumbulls. By birth or ancestry, the\r\nhonored names of Smalley, Ticknor, Marsh, and Mason, are associated\r\nwith this venerable town.\r\n\r\nMr. Wheelock's parish was in the northern and most retired part of the\r\ntown, and the least inviting, perhaps, in its physical aspects and\r\nnatural resources. The products of a rugged soil furnished the\r\nindustrious inhabitants with a comfortable subsistence, but left\r\nnothing for luxury. It was at that period a quiet agricultural\r\ncommunity, living largely within itself. As at the present day, there\r\nwas but one church within the territorial limits of the parish. The\r\n\"council of nine,\" selected from the more discreet of the male\r\nmembers, somewhat in accordance with Presbyterian usage, aided in the\r\nadministration of a careful and thorough discipline.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Mr. Wheelock was accounted one of the\r\nleading preachers and divines of his day. Both as a pastor, and the\r\nassociate of the eminent men who were prominent in the great revival\r\nwhich marked the middle of the last century, his labors were crowned\r\nwith large success. Rev. Dr. Burroughs, who knew him intimately, says:\r\n\"As a preacher, his aim was to reach the conscience. He studied great\r\nplainness of speech, and adapted his discourse to every capacity, that\r\nhe might be understood by all.\" His pupil, Dr. Trumbull, the\r\nhistorian, says: \"He was a gentleman of a comely figure, of a mild and\r\nwinning aspect, his voice smooth and harmonious, the best by far that\r\nI ever heard. He had the entire command of it. His gesture was\r\nnatural, but not redundant. His preaching and addresses were close and\r\npungent, and yet winning beyond almost all comparison.\"[4] By an\r\nintermarriage of their relatives, he was allied to the family of\r\nJonathan Edwards, whose high regard for him is sufficiently indicated\r\nin a letter dated Northampton, June 9, 1741, from which we make brief\r\nextracts. \"There has been a reviving of religion of late amongst us,\r\nbut your labors have been much more remarkably blessed than mine. May\r\nGod send you hither with the like blessing as He has sent you to some\r\nother places, and may your coming be a means to humble me for my\r\nbarrenness and unprofitableness, and a means of my instruction and\r\nenlivening. I want an opportunity to concert measures with you, for\r\nthe advancement of the kingdom and glory of the Redeemer.\"\r\n\r\n      [4] The venerable Prof. Stowe states that, when a professor in the\r\n          College, he was informed by an aged man, living in the\r\n          vicinity, that President Wheelock's earnestness in preaching\r\n          at times led him to leave the pulpit, and appeal to\r\n          individuals in his audience.\r\n\r\nWe are fortunate in having the testimony of a member of his own\r\nfamily, in regard to the beginning of Mr. Wheelock's more practical\r\ninterest in the unfortunate Aborigines. His grandson, Rev. William\r\nPatten, D.D., says,[5] \"One evening after a religious conference with\r\na number of his people at Lebanon, he walked out, as he usually did on\r\nsummer evenings, for meditation and prayer; and in his retirement his\r\nattention was led to the neglect [from lack of means] of his people in\r\nproviding for his support. It occurred to him, with peculiar\r\nclearness, that if they furnished him with but half a living, they\r\nwere entitled to no more than half his labors. And he concluded that\r\nthey were left to such neglect, to teach him that part of his labors\r\nought to be directed to other objects. He then inquired what objects\r\nwere most in want of assistance. And it occurred to him, almost\r\ninstantaneously, that the Indians were the most proper objects of the\r\ncharitable attention of Christians. He then determined to devote half\r\nof his time to them.\"\r\n\r\n      [5] Memoirs of Wheelock, p. 177.\r\n\r\nWe will now allow this eminent Christian philanthropist to speak for\r\nhimself. In his \"Narrative,\" for the period ending in 1762, after\r\nreferring to the too general lack of interest in the Indian, he says:\r\n\r\n\"It has seemed to me, he must be stupidly indifferent to the\r\nRedeemer's cause and interest in the world, and criminally deaf and\r\nblind to the intimations of the favor and displeasure of God in the\r\ndispensations of His Providence, who could not perceive plain\r\nintimations of God's displeasure against us for this neglect,\r\ninscribed in capitals, on the very front of divine dispensations, from\r\nyear to year, in permitting the savages to be such a sore scourge to\r\nour land, and make such depredations on our frontiers, inhumanly\r\nbutchering and captivating our people, not only in a time of war, but\r\nwhen we had good reason to think (if ever we had) that we dwelt safely\r\nby them. And there is good reason to think that if one half which has\r\nbeen expended for so many years past in building forts, manning, and\r\nsupporting them, had been prudently laid out in supporting faithful\r\nmissionaries and schoolmasters among them, the instructed and\r\ncivilized party would have been a far better defence than all our\r\nexpensive fortresses, and prevented the laying waste so many towns and\r\nvillages; witness the consequence of sending Mr. Sergeant to\r\nStockbridge, which was in the very road by which they most usually\r\ncame upon our people, and by which there has never been one attack\r\nmade upon us since his going there.\" After referring to the ordinary\r\nobligations of humanity, patriotism, and religion, he says:\r\n\r\n\"As there were few or none who seemed to lay the necessity and\r\nimportance of Christianizing the natives so much to heart as to exert\r\nthemselves in earnest and lead the way therein, I was naturally put\r\nupon consideration and inquiry what methods might have the greatest\r\nprobability of success; and upon the whole was fully persuaded that\r\nthis, which I have been pursuing, had by far the greatest probability\r\nof any that had been proposed, viz.: by the mission of their own\r\n[educated] sons in conjunction with the English; and that a number of\r\ngirls should also be instructed in whatever should be necessary to\r\nrender them fit to perform the female part, as house-wives,\r\nschool-mistresses, and tailoresses. The influence of their own sons\r\namong them will likely be much greater than of any Englishmen\r\nwhatsoever. There is no such thing as sending English missionaries, or\r\nsetting up English schools among them, to any good purpose, in most\r\nplaces, as their temper, state, and condition have been and still\r\nare.\" In illustration of his theory, he refers to the education, by\r\nthe assistance of the \"Honorable London Commissioners,\"[6] of Mr.\r\nSamson Occom, \"one of the Mohegan tribe, who has several years been a\r\nuseful school-master and successful preacher of the Gospel.\"[7]\r\n\r\n      [6] Agents of the Corporation in London referred to on page 2, of\r\n          which Robert Boyle was governor.\r\n\r\n      [7] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n\"After seeing the success of this attempt,\" he continues, \"I was more\r\nencouraged to hope that such a method might be very successful, and\r\nabove eight years ago I wrote to Rev. John Brainerd [brother of the\r\ndistinguished David Brainerd], missionary in New Jersey, desiring him\r\nto send me two likely boys for this purpose, of the Delaware tribe. He\r\naccordingly sent me John Pumpshire in the fourteenth, and Jacob\r\nWoolley in the eleventh years of their age. They arrived December 18,\r\n1754.\r\n\r\n\"Sometime after these boys came, the affair appearing with an\r\nagreeable aspect, I represented it to Col. Elisha Williams, late\r\nRector of Yale College, and Rev. Messrs. Samuel Moseley, of Windham,\r\nand Benjamin Pomeroy, of Hebron, and invited them to join me. They\r\nreadily accepted the invitation. And Mr. Joshua Moor,[8] late of\r\nMansfield, deceased, appeared, to give a small tenement in this place\r\n[Lebanon], for the foundation, use and support of a charity school,\r\nfor the education of Indian youth, etc.\" Mr. More's grant contained\r\n\"about two acres of pasturing, and a small house and shop,\" near Mr.\r\nWheelock's residence.\r\n\r\n      [8] Mr. M.'s own orthography is More.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman was one of the more prominent of the early settlers at\r\nMansfield. He owned and resided upon a large estate on the Willimantic\r\nriver, a few miles north of the present site of the village bearing\r\nthat name. There is sufficient evidence to warrant the belief, that\r\nthe first husband of Mr. More's mother was Mr. Thomas Howard (or\r\nHarwood), of Norwich, who was slain in the memorable fight at\r\nNarragansett Fort, in December, 1675, and that her maiden name was\r\nMary Wellman. From the church records, he appears to have been of a\r\nprofessedly religious character, as early as 1721. As his residence\r\nwas in the neighborhood of Mr. Wheelock's early home, and but little\r\nfarther removed from Lebanon \"Crank,\" as the north parish in that town\r\nwas styled, Mr. More had ample opportunities for a thorough\r\nacquaintance with the person to whom he now generously extended a\r\nhelping hand. It is not known that this worthy man left any posterity,\r\nto perpetuate a name which will be cherished with tender regard, so\r\nlong as the institution to which he furnished a home, in its infancy,\r\nshall have an existence.\r\n\r\nIn a summary of his work for the eight years, Mr. Wheelock says: \"I\r\nhave had two upon my hands since 1754, four since April, 1757, five\r\nsince April, 1759, seven since November, 1760, and eleven since\r\nAugust, 1761. And for some time I have had twenty-five, three of the\r\nnumber English youth. One of the Indian lads, Jacob Woolley, is now in\r\nhis last year at New Jersey College.\"\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that Occom would have taken a collegiate\r\ncourse, but for the partial failure of his health. On the whole, we\r\nare fully warranted in the opinion that, from the outset, Mr. Wheelock\r\ndesigned to have all his missionaries, whether Indian or English,\r\n\"thoroughly furnished\" for their work.\r\n\r\nBefore closing the \"Narrative,\" he gives an interesting account of\r\nmaterial resources.\r\n\r\n\"The Honorable London Commissioners, hearing of the design, inquired\r\ninto it, and encouraged it by an allowance of £12 lawful money, by\r\ntheir vote November 12, 1756. And again in the year 1758 they allowed\r\nme £20; and in November 4, 1760, granted me an annual allowance of £20\r\nfor my assistance; and in October 8, 1761, they granted me £12 towards\r\nthe support of Isaiah Uncas, son of the Sachem of Mohegan, and £10\r\nmore for his support the following year. In October, 1756, I received\r\na legacy of fifty-nine dollars of Mrs. Ann Bingham, of Windham. In\r\nJuly, 1761, I received a generous donation of fifty pounds sterling\r\nfrom the Right Hon. William, Marquis of Lothian; and in November,\r\n1761, a donation of £26 sterling from Mr. Hardy, of London; and in\r\nMay, 1762, a second donation of £50 sterling from that most honorable\r\nand noble lord, the Marquis of Lothian; and, at the same time, £20\r\nsterling from Mr. Samuel Savage, merchant in London; and a collection\r\nof ten guineas from the Rev. Dr. A. Gifford, in London; and £10\r\nsterling more from a lady in London, unknown, which is still in the\r\nhands of a friend, and to be remitted with some additional advantage,\r\nand to be accounted for when received. And, also, for seven years\r\npast, I have, one year with another, received about £11 lawful money,\r\nannually, interest of subscriptions. And in my journey to Portsmouth\r\nlast June, I received, in private donations, £66 17_s._ 7-1/4_d._,\r\nlawful money. I also received, for the use of this school, a bell of\r\nabout 80 lb. weight, from a gentleman in London. The Honorable Scotch\r\nCommissioners,[9] in and near Boston, understanding and approving of\r\nthe design of sending for Indian children of remote tribes to be\r\neducated here, were the first body, or society, who have led the way\r\nin making an attempt for that purpose. While I was in Boston they\r\npassed a vote, May 7, 1761, 'that the Reverend Mr. Wheelock, of\r\nLebanon, be desired to fit out David Fowler, an Indian youth, to\r\naccompany Mr. Samson Occom, going on a mission to the Oneidas; that\r\nsaid David be supported on said mission for a term not exceeding four\r\nmonths; and that he endeavor, on his return, to bring with him a\r\nnumber of Indian boys, not exceeding three, to be put under Mr.\r\nWheelock's care and instruction, and that £20 be put into Mr.\r\nWheelock's hands to carry this design into execution.' In November,\r\n1761, the Great and General Court or Assembly of the Province of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, voted that I should be allowed to take under my\r\ncare six children of the Six Nations, for education, clothing, and\r\nboarding, and be allowed for that purpose, for each of said children,\r\n£12 per annum for one year.\"[10]\r\n\r\n      [9] Agents of the Scotch \"Society for Propagating Christian\r\n          Knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n      [10] For tribes represented in the school, and other donors to the\r\n           school and college, see Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.--ACTION IN REGARD TO A\r\nCOLLEGE.--TESTIMONIAL OF CONNECTICUT CLERGYMEN.--LEGISLATIVE GRANT TO\r\nMR. WHEELOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of education to the welfare of any community, has been\r\nduly appreciated by the people of New Hampshire from the earliest\r\nperiods of her history.\r\n\r\nSuch an item as the following is worthy of notice:\r\n\r\n\"At a publique Town Meeting held the 5: 2 mo. 58 [1658,] It is agreed\r\nthat Twenty pounds per annum shall be yearly rayzed for the\r\nmayntenance of a School-master in the Town of Dover.\"[11] Harvard\r\nCollege being in need of a new building in 1669, the inhabitants of\r\nPortsmouth \"subscribed sixty pounds, which sum they agreed to pay\r\nannually for seven years to the overseers of Harvard College. Dover\r\ngave thirty-two pounds, and Exeter ten pounds for the same\r\npurpose.\"[12] Very few towns at the present day are as liberal, in\r\nproportion to their ability.\r\n\r\n      [11] Dover Town Records.\r\n\r\n      [12] Adams's Annals of Portsmouth, p. 50.\r\n\r\nClassical schools were established in all the more populous towns, and\r\nthese were furnished with competent teachers, who were graduates of\r\nHarvard College, or European universities.\r\n\r\nIn 1758, in the midst of the din and tumult of the French war, we find\r\nthe clergy--ever among the foremost in laudable enterprise--making an\r\nearnest effort for increased facilities for liberal education.\r\n\r\nWe give official records:\r\n\r\n\"The Convention of the Congregational Ministers in the Province of New\r\nHampshire, being held at the house of the Rev.

May it please your Excellency,--\r\n\r\n\"We, the Ministers of the Congregational Churches in this Province of\r\nNew Hampshire under your Excellency's Government now assembled in an\r\nAnnual Convention in Somersworth, as has been our custom for several\r\nyears past, the design of which is to pray together for his Majesty\r\nand Government, and to consult the interests of religion and virtue,\r\nfor our mutual assistance and encouragement in our proper business:\r\nBeg leave to present a request to your Excellency in behalf of\r\nliterature, which proceeds, not from any private or party views in us,\r\nbut our desire to serve the Government and religion by laying a\r\nfoundation for the best instruction of youth. We doubt not your\r\nExcellency is sensible of the great advantages of learning, and the\r\ndifficulties which attend the education of youth in this Province, by\r\nreason of our distance from any of the seats of learning, the\r\ndiscredit of our medium, etc. We have reason to hope that by an\r\ninterest among our people, and some favor from the Government, we may\r\nbe able in a little time to raise a sufficient fund for erecting and\r\ncarrying on an Academy or College within this Province, without\r\nprejudice to any other such seminary in neighboring Colonies, provided\r\nyour Excellency will be pleased to grant to us, a number of us, or any\r\nother trustees, whom your Excellency shall think proper to appoint, a\r\ngood and sufficient charter, by which they may be empowered to choose\r\na President, Professors, Tutors, or other officers, and regulate all\r\nmatters belonging to such a society. We therefore now humbly petition\r\nyour Excellency to grant such a charter as may, in the best manner,\r\nanswer such a design and intrust it with our Committee, viz.: Messrs.\r\nJoseph Adams, James Pike, John Moody, Ward Cotton, Nathaniel Gookin,\r\nWoodbridge Odlin, Samuel Langdon, and Samuel Haven, our brethren, whom\r\nwe have now chosen to wait upon your Excellency with this our\r\npetition, that we may use our influence with our people to promote so\r\ngood a design, by generous subscriptions, and that we may farther\r\npetition the General Court for such assistance, as they shall think\r\nnecessary. We are persuaded, if your Excellency will first of all\r\nfavor us with such a charter, we shall be able soon to make use of it\r\nfor the public benefit; and that your Excellency's name will forever\r\nbe remembered with honor. If, after trial, we cannot accomplish it, we\r\npromise to return the charter with all thankfulness for your\r\nExcellency's good disposition. It is our constant prayer that God\r\nwould prosper your Excellency's administration, and we beg leave to\r\nsubscribe ourselves your Excellency's most obedient servants.\r\n\r\n                              Joseph Adams, Moderator.\r\n    \"Proceedings attested by  Samuel Haven, Clerk.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Convention of Congregational Ministers in the Province of New\r\nHampshire being held at the house of the Rev.

But at the\r\nconvention held at Portsmouth, September 28, 1762, the Rev. Mr. John\r\nRogers having been chosen moderator, after prayer and sermon, the\r\nfollowing testimonial was laid before the Convention:\r\n\r\n\"Chelsea, Norwich, July 10, 1762.\r\n\r\n\"We ministers of the gospel and pastors of churches hereafter\r\nmentioned with our names, having, for a number of years past, heard of\r\nor seen with pleasure the zeal, courage, and firm resolution of the\r\nRev. Eleazar Wheelock of Lebanon, to prosecute to effect a design of\r\nspreading the gospel among the natives in the wilds of our America,\r\nand especially his perseverance in it, amidst the many peculiar\r\ndiscouragements he had to encounter during the late years of the war\r\nhere, and upon a plan which appears to us to have the greatest\r\nprobability of success, namely, by a mission of their own sons; and as\r\nwe are verily persuaded that the smiles of Divine Providence upon his\r\nschool, and the success of his endeavors hitherto justly may, and\r\nought, to encourage him and all to believe it to be of God, and that\r\nwhich he will own and succeed for the glory of his great name in the\r\nenlargement of the kingdom of our divine Redeemer, as well as for the\r\ngreat benefit of the crown of Great Britain, and especially of his\r\nMajesty's dominions in America; so we apprehend the present openings\r\nin Providence ought to invite Christians of every denomination to\r\nunite their endeavors and to lend a helping hand in carrying on so\r\ncharitable a design; and we are heartily sorry if party spirit and\r\nparty differences shall at all obstruct the progress of it; or the old\r\nleaven of this land ferment upon this occasion, and give a watchful\r\nadversary opportunity so to turn the course of endeavors into another\r\nchannel as to defeat the design of spreading the gospel among the\r\nheathen. To prevent which, and encourage unanimity and zeal in\r\nprosecuting the design, we look upon it our duty as Christians, and\r\nespecially as ministers of the gospel, to give our testimony that, as\r\nwe verily believe, a disinterested regard to the advancement of the\r\nRedeemer's kingdom and the good will of His Majesty's dominions in\r\nAmerica, were the governing motives which at first induced the Rev.\r\nMr. Wheelock to enter upon the great affair, and to risk his own\r\nprivate interest, as he has done since, in carrying it on; so we\r\nesteem his plan to be good, his measures to be prudently and well\r\nconcerted, his endowments peculiar, his zeal fervent, his endeavors\r\nindefatigable, for the accomplishing this design, and we know no man,\r\nlike minded, who will naturally care for their state. May God prolong\r\nhis life, and make him extensively useful in the kingdom of Christ. We\r\nhave also, some of us, at his desire examined his accounts, and we\r\nfind that, besides giving in all his own labour and trouble in the\r\naffair, he has charged for the support, schooling, etc., of the youth,\r\nat the lowest rate it could be done for, as the price of things have\r\nbeen and still are among us; and we apprehend the generous donations\r\nalready made have been and we are confident will be laid out in the\r\nmost prudent manner, and with the best advice for the furtherance of\r\nthe important design: and we pray God abundantly to reward the\r\nliberality of many upon this occasion. And we hope the generosity,\r\nespecially of persons of distinction and note, will be a happy lead\r\nand inducement to still greater liberalities, and that in consequence\r\nthereof the wide-extended wilderness of America will blossom as the\r\nrose, habitations of cruelty become dwelling places of righteousness\r\nand the blessing of thousands ready to perish come upon all those\r\nwhose love to Christ and charity to them has been shown upon this\r\noccasion.

Said\r\ncommittee laid the following draft before the Convention, which was\r\nunanimously voted and signed by the moderator:\r\n\r\n\"We, a Convention of Congregational Ministers assembled at Portsmouth,\r\nSeptember 28, 1762, having read and considered the foregoing\r\nattestation from a number of reverend gentlemen in Connecticut, taking\r\ninto consideration the many obligations the Supreme Ruler has laid\r\nupon Christian churches to promote his cause and enlarge the borders\r\nof his kingdom in this land, the signal victories he has granted to\r\nour troops, the entire reduction of all Canada, so that a way is now\r\nopen for the spreading of the light and purity of the gospel among\r\ndistant savage tribes, and a large field, white unto the harvest, is\r\npresented before us; considering the infinite worth of the souls of\r\nmen, the importance of the gospel to their present and everlasting\r\nhappiness, and the hopeful prospect that the aboriginal natives will\r\nnow listen to Christian instruction; considering also the great\r\nexpense which must unavoidably attend the prosecution of this great\r\ndesign, think ourselves obliged to recommend, in the warmest manner,\r\nthis subject to the serious consideration of our Christian brethren\r\nand the public. It is with gratitude to the Great Head of the Church,\r\nwho has the hearts of all in his hands, that we observe some hopeful\r\nsteps taken by the societies founded for the gospelizing the Indians,\r\nand the hearts of such numbers, both at home and in this land, have\r\nbeen disposed to bestow their liberalities to enable such useful\r\nsocieties to effect the great ends for which they are founded. But as\r\nwe wish to see every probable method taken to forward so benevolent\r\nand Christian a design, we, therefore, rejoice to find that the Rev.\r\nMr. Wheelock has such a number of Indian youths under his care and\r\ntuition; and in that abundant testimony which his brethren in the\r\nministry have borne to his abilities for, and zeal and faithfulness\r\nin, this important undertaking. And we do hereby declare our hearty\r\napprobation of it, as far as we are capable of judging of an affair\r\ncarried on at such a distance; and think it our duty to encourage and\r\nexhort all Christians to lend a helping hand towards so great and\r\ngenerous an undertaking. We would not, indeed, absolutely dictate\r\nthis, or any other particular scheme, for civilizing and spreading the\r\ngospel among the Indians; but we are persuaded that God demands of the\r\ninhabitants of these colonies some returns of gratitude, in this way,\r\nfor the remarkable success of our arms against Canada, and that peace\r\nand security which he has now given us; we must, therefore, rely on\r\nthe wisdom and prudence of the civil authority to think of it as a\r\nmatter in which our political interests as well as the glory of God\r\nare deeply concerned; and we refer to our churches and all private\r\nChristians as peculiarly called to promote the Redeemer's kingdom\r\neverywhere, to determine what will be the most effectual methods of\r\nforwarding so noble and pious a design, and to contribute, to the\r\nutmost of their power, either towards the execution of the plan which\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Wheelock is pursuing, or that of the corporation erected\r\nin the Province of Massachusetts Bay, or any other which may be\r\nthought of here or elsewhere, for the same laudable purpose.\r\n\r\n    John Rogers, Moderator.\"\r\n\r\nThe first Legislative action in New Hampshire relative to Mr.\r\nWheelock's work is also worthy of notice. The following is from the\r\nJournal of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\n\"June 17, 1762, Voted, that the Hon. Henry Sherburne and Mishech\r\nWeare, Esquires, Peter Gilman, Clement March, Esq., Capt. Thomas W.\r\nWaldron, and Capt. John Wentworth be a committee to consider of the\r\nsubject-matter of Rev. Mr. Eleazar Wheelock's memorial for aid for his\r\nschool.\" This committee made a favorable report, saying: \"We think it\r\nincumbent on this province to do something towards promoting so good\r\nan undertaking,\" and recommending a grant of fifty pounds sterling per\r\nannum for five years. The action of the Legislature was in accordance\r\nwith this report. Later records, however, indicate that the grant was\r\nnot continued after the first, or possibly the second, year. Gov.\r\nBenning Wentworth, after careful investigation, gave his official\r\nsanction to the action of his associates, in aid of Mr. Wheelock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA COLLEGE CONTEMPLATED BY MR. WHEELOCK.--LORD DARTMOUTH.--OCCOM AND\r\nWHITAKER IN GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wheelock held relations more or less intimate with the leading\r\neducational institutions of the country. But his favorite college was\r\nat Princeton, New Jersey, far removed from his own residence. A warm\r\nfriendship subsisted between him and many of its officers, and thither\r\nhe sent most of his students for a considerable period. The\r\ninconvenience of doing this, may have suggested the idea of a college\r\nin connection with his school. However this may have been, nothing\r\nshort of a college could satisfy him. The following letter, written in\r\nApril, 1763, needs no further preface:\r\n\r\n\"TO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL JEFFREY AMHERST, BARONET.\r\n\r\n\"May it please your Excellency,--The narrative herewith inclosed,\r\ngives your Excellency some short account of the success of my feeble\r\nendeavors, through the blessing of God upon them, in the affair there\r\nrelated.\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency will easily see, that if the number of youth in this\r\nschool continues to increase, as it has done, and as our prospects are\r\nthat it will do, we shall soon be obliged to build to accommodate them\r\nand accordingly to determine upon the place where to fix it, and I\r\nwould humbly submit to your Excellency's consideration the following\r\nproposal, viz.: That a tract of land, about fifteen or twenty miles\r\nsquare, or so much as shall be sufficient for four townships, on the\r\nwest side of Susquehannah river, or in some other place more\r\nconvenient in the heart of the Indian country, be granted in favor of\r\nthis school: That said townships be peopled with a chosen number of\r\ninhabitants of known honesty, integrity, and such as love and will be\r\nkind to, and honest in their dealings with Indians. That a thousand\r\nacres of, and within said grant, be given to this school, and that\r\nthe school be an academy for all parts of useful learning; part of it\r\nto be a college for the education of missionaries, interpreters,\r\nschoolmasters, etc.; and part of it a school to teach reading,\r\nwriting, etc., and that there be manufactures for the instruction both\r\nof males and females, in whatever shall be necessary in life, and\r\nproper tutors, masters, and mistresses be provided for the same. That\r\nthose towns be furnished with ministers of the best characters, and\r\nsuch as are of ability, when incorporated with a number of the most\r\nunderstanding of the inhabitants, to conduct the affairs of the\r\nschool, and of such missions as they shall have occasion and ability\r\nfor, from time to time. That there be a sufficient number of laborers\r\nupon the lands belonging to the school; and that the students be\r\nobliged to labor with them, and under their direction and conduct, so\r\nmuch as shall be necessary for their health, and to give them an\r\nunderstanding of husbandry; and those who are designed for farmers,\r\nafter they have got a sufficient degree of school learning, to labor\r\nconstantly, and the school to have all the benefit of their labor, and\r\nthey the benefit of being instructed therein, till they are of an age\r\nand understanding sufficient to set up for themselves, and introduce\r\nhusbandry among their respective tribes; and that there be a moderate\r\ntax upon all the granted lands, after the first ten or fifteen years,\r\nand also some duty upon mills, etc., which shall not be burdensome to\r\nthe inhabitants, for the support of the school, or missionaries among\r\nthe Indians, etc. By this means much expense, and many inconveniences\r\noccasioned by our great distance from them, would be prevented, our\r\nmissionaries be much better supported and provided for, especially in\r\ncase of sickness, etc. Parents and children would be more contented,\r\nbeing nearer to one another, and likely many would be persuaded to\r\nsend their children for an education, who are now dissuaded from it\r\nonly on account of the great distance of the school from them.\r\n\r\n\"The bearer, Mr. C. J. S.,[13] is able, if your Excellency desires it,\r\nto give you a more full and particular account of the present state of\r\nthis school, having been for some time the master and instructor of\r\nit, and is now designed, with the leave of Providence, the ensuing\r\nsummer, to make an excursion as a missionary among the Indians, with\r\nan interpreter from this school.\r\n\r\n\"And by him your Excellency may favor me with your thoughts on what I\r\nhave proposed.\r\n\r\n\"I am, with sincerest duty and esteem, may it please your Excellency,\r\nyour Excellency's most obedient and humble servant,\r\n\r\n    Eleazar Wheelock.\"\r\n\r\n      [13] Charles J. Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1764, the Scotch Society, already referred to, manifested\r\nincreasing interest in Mr. Wheelock's work, by appointing a Board of\r\nCorrespondents, selected from gentlemen of high standing, in\r\nConnecticut, to coöperate with him.\r\n\r\nWe here insert entire, Mr. Wheelock's first letter to Lord Dartmouth:\r\n\r\n\"TO THE RIGHT HON. THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH.\r\n\r\n\"Lebanon, Connecticut, New England, March 1, 1764.\r\n\r\n\"May it please your Lordship,--\r\n\r\n\"It must be counted amongst the greatest favors of God to a wretched\r\nworld, and that which gives abundant joy to the friends of Zion, that\r\namong earthly dignities there are those who cheerfully espouse the\r\nsinking cause of the great Redeemer, and whose hearts and hands are\r\nopen to minister supplies for the support and enlargement of His\r\nkingdom in the world.\r\n\r\n\"As your Lordship has been frequently mentioned with pleasure by the\r\nlovers of Christ in this wilderness, and having fresh assurance of the\r\ntruth of that fame of yours, by the Rev. Mr. Whitefield, from his own\r\nacquaintance with your person and character, and being encouraged and\r\nmoved thereto by him, I am now emboldened, without any other apology\r\nfor myself than that which the nature of the case itself carries in\r\nits very front, to solicit your Lordship's favorable notice of, and\r\nfriendship towards, a feeble attempt to save the swarms of Indian\r\nnatives in this land from final and eternal ruin, which must\r\nunavoidably be the issue of those poor, miserable creatures, unless\r\nGod shall mercifully interpose with His blessing upon endeavors to\r\nprevent it.\r\n\r\n\"The Indian Charity School, under my care (a narrative of which,\r\nherewith transmitted, humbly begs your Lordship's acceptance), has\r\nmet with such approbation and encouragement from gentlemen of\r\ncharacter and ability, at home and abroad, and such has been the\r\nsuccess of endeavors hitherto used therein, as persuade us more and\r\nmore that it is of God, and a device and plan which, under his\r\nblessing, has a greater probability of success than any that has yet\r\nbeen attempted. By the blessing and continual care of heaven, it has\r\nlived, and does still live and flourish, without any other fund\r\nappropriated to its support than that great one, in the hands of Him,\r\nwhose the earth is, and the fullness thereof.\r\n\r\n\"And I trust there is no need to mention any other considerations to\r\nprove your Lordship's compassions, or invite your liberality on this\r\noccasion, than those which their piteous and perishing case does of\r\nitself suggest, when once your Lordship shall be well satisfied of a\r\nproper and probable way to manifest and express the same with success.\r\nWhich I do with the utmost cheerfulness submit to your Lordship,\r\nbelieving your determination therein to be under the direction of Him\r\nwho does all things well. And, if the nature and importance of the\r\ncase be not esteemed sufficient excuse for the freedom and boldness I\r\nhave assumed, I must rely upon your Lordship's innate goodness to\r\npardon him who is, with the greatest duty and esteem, my lord,\r\n\r\n    \"Your Lordship's most obedient,\r\n    \"And most humble servant,\r\n    \"Eleazar Wheelock.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe here the agency of Mr. Wheelock's old and\r\nintimate friend, Whitefield. As early as 1760, after alluding to\r\nefforts in his behalf in Great Britain, he wrote to Mr. Wheelock:\r\n\r\n\"Had I a converted Indian scholar, that could preach and pray in\r\nEnglish, something might be done to purpose.\"\r\n\r\nAfter much deliberation, Mr. Wheelock determined to send Mr. Occom and\r\nRev. Nathaniel Whitaker of Norwich, who was deeply interested in his\r\nwork, to solicit the charities of British Christians, with a purpose\r\nof more extended operations.\r\n\r\nThey left this country late in 1765, carrying testimonials from a\r\nlarge number of eminent civilians and divines.\r\n\r\nThe following letter indicates that they were cordially welcomed in\r\nEngland:\r\n\r\n\"London, February 2, 1766.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Wheelock,--This day three weeks I had the pleasure of\r\nseeing Mr. Whitaker and Mr. Occom. On their account, I have deferred\r\nmy intended journey into the country all next week. They have been\r\nintroduced to, and dined with the Daniel of the age, viz., the truly\r\nnoble Lord Dartmouth. Mr. Occom is also to be introduced by him to his\r\nMajesty, who intends to favor their design with his bounty. A short\r\nmemorial for the public is drawn, which is to be followed with a small\r\npamphlet. All denominations are to be applied to, and therefore no\r\nmention is made of any particular commissioners or corresponding\r\ncommittees whatsoever. It would damp the thing entirely. Cashiers are\r\nto be named, and the moneys collected are to be deposited with them\r\ntill drawn for by yourself. Mr. Occom hath preached for me with\r\nacceptance, and also Mr. Whitaker. They are to go round the other\r\ndenominations in a proper rotation. As yet everything looks with a\r\npromising aspect. I have procured them suitable lodgings. I shall\r\ncontinue to do everything that lies in my power. Mr. S.[14] is\r\nprovidentially here,--a fast friend to your plan and his dear country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I wish you joy of the long wished for, long prayed for repeal, and\r\nam, my dear Mr. Wheelock,\r\n\r\n\"Yours, etc., in our glorious Head,\r\n\r\n    \"George Whitefield.\"\r\n\r\n      [14] Mr. John Smith, of Boston.\r\n\r\nWe are now introduced to Mr. Wheelock's most valuable coadjutor, the\r\nson of Mark Hunking Wentworth,--another active and earnest friend:\r\n\r\n\"Bristol, [England,] 16th Dec., 1766.\r\n\r\n\"The Rev. Mr. Whitaker having requested my testimony of an institution\r\nforming in America, under the name of an Indian School, for which\r\npurpose many persons on that continent and in Europe have liberally\r\ncontributed, and he is now soliciting the further aid of all\r\ndenominations of people in this kingdom to complete the proposed plan,\r\nI do therefore certify, whomsoever it may concern, that the said\r\nIndian School appears to me to be formed upon principles of extensive\r\nbenevolence and unfeigned piety; that the moneys already collected\r\nhave been justly applied to this and no other use. From repeated\r\ninformation of many principal gentlemen in America, and from my own\r\nparticular knowledge of local circumstances, I am well convinced that\r\nthe charitable contributions afforded to this design will be honestly\r\nand successfully applied to civilize and recover the savages of\r\nAmerica from their present barbarous paganism.\r\n\r\n    \"J. Wentworth,\r\n\r\n    \"Governor of New Hampshire.\"\r\n\r\nThe annals of philanthropy unfold few things bolder or more romantic\r\nin conception, or grander in execution, or sublimer in results than\r\nthis most memorable, most successful pilgrimage. The unique, but\r\nmagnetic, marvelous eloquence of this regenerated son of the forest,\r\nas he passed from town to town, and city to city, over England and\r\nScotland, engaged the attention and opened the hearts of all\r\nclasses--the clergy, the nobility, and the peasantry. The names of the\r\nmen and women and children, who gave of their abundance or their\r\npoverty, primarily and apparently to civilize and evangelize their\r\nwild and savage brethren across the sea, but ultimately and really to\r\nfound one of the most solid and beautiful temples of Christian and\r\nsecular learning, in the Western hemisphere, deserve affectionate and\r\nperpetual remembrance, along with those of their kindred, who in a\r\npreceding century dedicated their whole treasure upon Plymouth Rock.\r\n\r\nWith sincere regret that we have not the name of every donor, yet with\r\ndevout gratitude for the preservation of so full a record, we append\r\nthe original list of donors in England, as prepared and published at\r\nthe time, by Lord Dartmouth and his associates.[15]\r\n\r\n      [15] See Appendix.\r\n\r\nNever was more timely aid given to a worthy cause. When Mr. Wheelock's\r\nagents went abroad he had a school of about thirty, and an empty\r\ntreasury. These funds gave him present comfort, and enabled him to\r\neffect the long-desired removal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM JOHNSON.--EXPLORATIONS FOR A LOCATION. ADVICE OF ENGLISH\r\nTRUSTEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wheelock was in friendly correspondence, for several years, with\r\nSir William Johnson, the distinguished Indian agent and\r\nsuperintendent, who resided in the province of New York, near the Six\r\nNations. Through his agency, the famous Mohawk, Joseph Brant, was sent\r\nto Mr. Wheelock's school. After enjoying some opportunities for an\r\nestimate of his abilities and character, Mr. Wheelock speaks of him in\r\nhighly complimentary terms, as a gentleman, \"whose understanding and\r\ninfluence in Indian affairs, is, I suppose, greater than any other\r\nman's, and to whose indefatigable and successful labors to settle and\r\nsecure a peace with the several tribes, who have been at war with us,\r\nour land and nation are under God chiefly indebted.\"\r\n\r\nIn September, 1762, Mr. Wheelock writes to Sir William: \"I understand\r\nthat some of our people are about to settle on a new purchase on\r\nSusquehannah river. It may be a door may open for my design on that\r\npurchase.\" He also intimates that he desires to set up the school in\r\nhis neighborhood. This plan does not meet Sir William's approval, but\r\nin January, 1763, Mr. Wheelock addresses him again, saying: \"Gov.\r\nWentworth has offered a tract of land in the western part of the\r\nprovince of New Hampshire which he is now settling, for the use of the\r\nschool if we will fix it there, and there has been some talk of fixing\r\nit in one of the new townships in the province of the Massachusetts\r\nwhich lie upon New York line near Albany. I much want to consult your\r\nHonor in the affair.\" Mr. Wheelock's confidence in his friend having\r\nbeen strengthened by the receipt of several cordial letters, and\r\nother circumstances, he writes to him, July 4, 1766: \"I apprehend you\r\nare able above any man in this land to serve the grand design in\r\nview,\" desiring to \"act in every step\" agreeable to his mind, and\r\ninforming him that he has sent his son, with Dr. Pomeroy, to confer\r\nwith him about a location for the school. He also refers to \"arguments\r\noffered to carry it into the Southern governments.\" But Mr. Johnson\r\ndid not see fit to invite the settlement of the school in the\r\nneighborhood of the Six Nations, deeming it unwise, apparently, to\r\nencourage a movement which might be regarded by them as an invasion of\r\ntheir territory, especially if they were asked to give lands to the\r\nschool. This decision virtually determined the location. If Mr.\r\nWheelock could not follow his old neighbors and friends to the\r\nwestward, and plant himself beside the great Indian Confederacy, he\r\nmust turn his attention to the northward, where other neighbors and\r\nfriends were settling within easy reach of the far-extended Indian\r\ntribes of Canada. Other localities, as we shall see hereafter,\r\npresented some inducements, but they were all of minor importance.\r\nHence, when his agents returned from Great Britain placing the\r\nlong-desired funds for the accomplishment of his purposes in his\r\nhands, we may well imagine that Mr. Wheelock gladly turned toward that\r\nworthy magistrate, who had already shown \"a willing heart,\" for more\r\naid.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Mr. Wheelock was giving the matter of a location his\r\nmost earnest and careful attention. In a letter to Mr. Whitefield,\r\ndated September 4, 1766, he says: \"We cannot get land enough on Hudson\r\nriver.\" Nor has he any more hope of success on the Mohawk. \"Large\r\noffers have been made in the new settlements on Connecticut river. It\r\nis likely that near twenty thousand acres would be given in their\r\nseveral towns.\" After stating that \"Col. Willard\" has made generous\r\noffers of lands, \"on Sugar river,\" he says: \"that location would be\r\nthe most inviting of any part of that country. Samuel Stevens, Esq.,\r\noffers two thousand acres to have it at No. 4. Col. Chandler offers\r\ntwo thousand acres in the centre of the town of Chester, opposite to\r\nNo. 4, nine miles from the River. The situation of Wyoming, on\r\nSusquehannah river, is very convenient.\"[16] A few months later,\r\nGeneral Schuyler earnestly advocated the claims of Albany as a\r\nfavorable location.\r\n\r\n      [16] See Appendix.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Wheelock's friends were very unwilling that he should leave\r\nConnecticut. Windham and Hebron[17] made earnest efforts to obtain the\r\nschool. We quote from Lebanon parish records:\r\n\r\n      [17] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n\"At a legal and full meeting of the Inhabitants, legal voters of the\r\nsecond society in Lebanon [now Columbia], in Connecticut, held in said\r\nsociety on the 29th day of June, Anno Domini 1767, We made choice of\r\nMr. James Pinneo to be moderator of said meeting, and passed the\r\nfollowing votes, _nemine contradicente_:\r\n\r\n\"1. That we desire the Indian Charity School now under the care of the\r\nRev. Mr. Eleazar Wheelock, may be fixed to continue in this society:\r\nprovided it may consist with the interest and prosperity of said\r\nSchool.\r\n\r\n\"2. That as we have a large and convenient house for public and divine\r\nWorship, we will accommodate the members of said school with such\r\nconvenient seats in said house as we shall be able.\r\n\r\n\"3. That the following letter be presented to the Rev. Mr. Eleazar\r\nWheelock, by Messrs. Israel Woodward, James Pinneo, and Asahel Clark,\r\nJun., in the name and behalf of this society; and that they desire him\r\nto transmit a copy of the same, with the votes foregoing, to the Right\r\nHonorable the Earl of Dartmouth, and the rest of those Honorable and\r\nWorthy Gentlemen in England who have condescended to patronize said\r\nschool; and to whom the establishment of the same is committed.\r\n\r\n\"The Inhabitants of the Second Society in Lebanon in Connecticut to\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Eleazar Wheelock, Pastor of said Society.\r\n\r\n\"Rev. and ever dear Pastor,--As you are witness to our past care and\r\nconcern for the success of your most pious and charitable undertaking\r\nin favor of the poor perishing Indians on this continent, we are\r\nconfident you will not be displeased at our addressing you on this\r\noccasion; but that you would rather think it strange if we should\r\naltogether hold our peace at such a time as this; when we understand\r\nit is still in doubt both with yourself and friends where to fix your\r\nschool; whether at Albany or more remote among the Indian tribes, in\r\nthis society where it was first planted, or in some other part of this\r\ncolony proposed for its accommodation.\r\n\r\n\"We have some of us heard most of the arguments offered for its\r\nremoval, and however plausible they appear we are not at all convinced\r\nof their force, or that it is expedient, everything considered, it\r\nshould be removed, nor do we think we have great reason to fear the\r\nevent, only we would not be wanting as to our duty in giving such\r\nhints in favor of its continuance here as naturally and easily occur\r\nto our minds, for we have that confidence in you and the friends of\r\nthe design, that you will not be easily carried away with appearances:\r\nbut will critically observe the secret springs of those generous\r\noffers, made in one place and another, (some of which are beyond what\r\nwe can pretend to,) whether some prospect of private emolument be not\r\nat the bottom; or whether they will finally prove more kind to your\r\npious institution as such considered, (whatever their pretenses may\r\nbe,) than they have been or at present appear to be to the Redeemer's\r\nKingdom in general. We trust this institution, so well calculated to\r\nthe advancement of its interest, will flourish best among the\r\nRedeemer's friends; and although with respect to ourselves we have\r\nlittle to boast as to friendship to our divine Redeemer or his\r\ninterest, yet this we are sure of, that he has been very kind to us,\r\nin times past, and we trust has made you the instrument of much good\r\nto us, and to lay a foundation for it to succeeding generations; we\r\nhumbly hope God has been preparing an habitation for himself here, and\r\nhas said of it, this is my resting place, here will I dwell forever,\r\n(not because they deserved it,) but because I have desired it, and\r\nwhere God is pleased to dwell, under his influence your institution\r\n(which we trust is of Him) may expect to live and thrive. We desire it\r\nmay be considered that this is its birth place, here it was kindly\r\nreceived, and nourished when no other door was set open to it--here it\r\nfound friends when almost friendless, yea when despised and contemned\r\nabroad--its friends are now increased here as well as elsewhere, and\r\nalthough by reason of our poverty and the hardness of the times, our\r\nsubscriptions are small compared with what some others may boast,\r\nbeing at present but about £810 lawful money, yet there are here some\r\nother privileges which we think very valuable and serviceable to the\r\ndesign, viz. 400 acres of very fertile and good land, about forty\r\nacres of which are under improvement, and the remainder well set with\r\nchoice timber and fuel, and is suitably proportioned for the various\r\nbranches of Husbandry which will much accommodate the design as said\r\nland is situated within about half a mile of our Meeting House, and\r\nmay be purchased for fifty shillings lawful money per acre. There is\r\nalso several other small parcels of land suitably situate for building\r\nplaces for the use of the school to be sold at a reasonable rate. We\r\nhave also a beautiful building place for said school within a few rods\r\nof said meeting house, adjacent to which is a large and pleasant\r\nGreen: and we are confident that wood, provisions, and clothing, etc.,\r\nwhich will be necessary for the school, may be had here not only now,\r\nbut in future years, at as low a rate as in any place in the colony,\r\nor in any other place where it has been proposed to settle your\r\nschool. These privileges, we think, are valuable and worthy your\r\nconsideration, and also of those honourable and worthy gentlemen in\r\nEngland to whom you have committed the decision of the affair, and\r\nfrom the friendly disposition which has so many years past and does\r\nstill reign in our breasts towards it, we think it may be presumed we\r\nshall from time to time be ready to minister to its support as\r\noccasion shall require and our circumstances permit. We take the\r\nliberty further to observe that such has hitherto been the peace and\r\ngood order (greatly through your instrumentality), obtaining among us\r\nthat the members of your school have all along been as free from\r\ntemptations to any vicious courses or danger of fatal error as perhaps\r\nmight be expected they would be on any spot of this universally\r\npolluted globe.\r\n\r\n\"Here, dear sir, your school has flourished remarkably. It has grown\r\napace; from small beginnings how very considerable has it become; an\r\nevidence that the soil and climate suit the institution--if you\r\ntransplant it you run a risk of stinting its growth, perhaps of\r\ndestroying its very life, or at least of changing its nature and\r\nmissing the pious aim you have all along had in view; a danger which\r\nscarce needs to be hinted, as you are sensible it has been the common\r\nfate of institutions of this kind that charitable donations have been\r\nmisapplied and perverted to serve purposes very far from or contrary\r\nto those the pious donors had in view; such is the subtilty of the old\r\nserpent that he will turn all our weapons against ourselves if\r\npossible. Aware of this, you have all along appeared to decline and\r\neven detest all such alliances and proposals as were calculated for,\r\nor seemed to promise any private emolument to your self or your\r\nfriends. This, we trust, is still your prevailing temper, and rejoice\r\nto hear that your friends and those who are intrusted with the affair\r\nin England are exactly in the same sentiments, happy presage not only\r\nof the continuance of the institution itself but we hope of its\r\nimmutability as to place. One thing more we beg leave to mention (not\r\nto tire your patience with the many that occur), viz. if you remove\r\nthe school from us, you, at the same time, take away our Minister, the\r\nlight of our eyes and joy of our hearts, under whose ministrations we\r\nhave sat with great delight; whose labors have been so acceptable, and\r\nwe trust profitable, for a long time; must, then, our dear and worthy\r\nPastor and his pious institution go from us together? Alas, shall we\r\nbe deprived of both in one day? We are sensible that we have abused\r\nsuch privileges and have forfeited them; and at God's bar we plead\r\nguilty--we pray Him to give us repentance and reformation, and to\r\nlengthen out our happy state; we own the justice of God in so heavy\r\nlosses, if they must be inflicted; and even in the removal of our\r\nCandlestick out of its place, but we can't bear the thought that you\r\nour Dear Pastor and the dear friends to your pious institution should\r\nbecome the executioners of such a vengeance. However, we leave the\r\nmatter with you, and are with much duty and filial regard, dear sir,\r\nYour very humble servants or rather obedient children.\r\n\r\n    \"By order of said Society,    Israel Woodward,\r\n                                  James Pinneo,\r\n                                  Asahel Clark, Jr.\"\r\n\r\n    \"June 29, 1767.\"\r\n\r\nThis interesting document bears the same date with Mr. Wheelock's\r\nDoctorate in Divinity, from the University of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nDr. Wheelock, appreciating the importance of a better knowledge of the\r\ncomparative advantages of the various proposed locations, finally\r\ndetermined to commission trustworthy agents, to make thorough\r\nexplorations. We give his language, in substance:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Lebanon, Connecticut, July 20, 1768.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas the number in my Indian Charity School is now, by the\r\nblessing of God, become so large as that it is necessary the place\r\nwhere to fix it should be speedily determined, and so many and\r\ngenerous have been the offers made for that purpose by gentlemen of\r\ncharacter and distinction in several neighboring governments, I do,\r\ntherefore, hereby authorize and appoint the Rev. Mr. Ebenezer\r\nCleaveland, of Gloucester, in the province of the Massachusetts Bay,\r\nand my son, Ralph Wheelock (while the Rev. Dr. Whitaker is performing\r\nthe like part in Pennsylvania) in my name and stead, to wait upon his\r\nExcellency John Wentworth, Esq., Governor of New Hampshire, and his\r\nassociates in office, to know what countenance and encouragement they\r\nwill give to accommodate and endow said school, in case it should be\r\nfixed in the western part of that province.\"\r\n\r\nDeep interest in Dr. Wheelock's work being manifested by Rev. Thomas\r\nAllen and others, at Pittsfield; Timothy Woodbridge and others, at\r\nStockbridge;[18] and Abraham J. Lansing, the founder of\r\nLansingburg,[19] and many others in that Province, they were also\r\ninstructed to extend their explorations to Western Massachusetts and\r\nto New York.\r\n\r\n      [18] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n      [19] See Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe following is the material portion of Mr. Cleaveland's report:\r\n\r\n\"I waited upon his Excellency John Wentworth, Esq., Governor of New\r\nHampshire. He appeared very friendly to the design--promised to grant\r\na township, six miles square, to the use of the school, provided it\r\nshould be fixed in that Province, and that he would use his influence\r\nthat his Majesty should give the quit-rents to the school, to be free\r\nfrom charge of fees except for surveying. Esquire Whiting, the Deputy\r\nSurveyor, being present, offered his assistance to look out the\r\ntownship and survey it, and give the service to the school. His\r\nExcellency the Governor recommended him to me for that purpose (since\r\nwhich, we found Landaff, a good township, to have forfeited the\r\ncharter, of which we advised the Governor, and were informed [that] he\r\npromised to reserve it for the school). After spending a few days on\r\nour way with gentlemen of the lower towns, who appeared universally\r\ndesirous that the school should come into that Province, and were\r\ngenerous in their offers to encourage the same, but proposed their\r\ndonations, generally, where their interests in land lay we proceeded\r\nto Plymouth, Romney, and Compton, where Mr. Whiting left me. Five\r\nthousand acres of land were proposed to be given, on condition the\r\nschool be fixed in either of these towns. Seventy-five pounds sterling\r\nand twenty thousand feet of boards (besides land) are offered on\r\ncondition it should be fixed in Compton. The arguments used for fixing\r\nthe school here are--'t is the centre of that province; good and easy\r\nportage by land and water to Portsmouth and Newbury; but twenty-seven\r\nmiles further than Connecticut river from the Indians.\r\n\r\n\"From thence I travelled to Cohos, on Connecticut river; the\r\ninhabitants of that new country were universally much engaged to have\r\nthe school fixed there, both from a respect to Dr. Wheelock's person\r\nand a regard to the general design; it would be too lengthy to mention\r\nthe particular offers that were generously made. Besides what has been\r\nalready mentioned, upwards of sixteen thousand acres are already\r\nsubscribed, chiefly by gentlemen of the most noted and public\r\ncharacters in the Province of New Hampshire; and more is subscribing\r\nto have it fixed in the country of Cohos. Besides which, large\r\nsubscriptions have been made and are still making which centre in\r\nparticular towns, the principal of which and those where I was\r\nadvised, and thought proper to take the most particular view, were\r\nHaverhill and Orford. These places are about equally distant from\r\nPortsmouth, ninety-two miles, thirty of which is good water carriage,\r\nthe rest may be made a good wagon road. In this new country there are\r\nmore than two hundred towns chartered, settled, and about to settle,\r\nand generally of a religious people, which do, and soon will, want\r\nministers; and they have no college or public seminary of learning for\r\nthat purpose in that Province, which want they apprehend may be\r\nsupplied by this school without any disadvantage to, or interfering in\r\nthe least, with the general design of it. These places are situate\r\nabout forty miles nearer to the Six Nations than the place where the\r\nschool now is; they are about one hundred miles from Mount Royal and\r\nabout sixty from Crown Point; and, perhaps, about sixty from the\r\nIndians at St. Francis, to whom there is water portage by Connecticut\r\nand St. Francis Rivers, except a mile or two; there is also water\r\ncarriage from hence by the Lakes and St. Lawrence River, etc., by the\r\nSix Nations and the tribes many hundred miles west, except very small\r\nland carriages. Population in this new country is very rapid, and will\r\ndoubtless be much more so if the Doctor should remove there with his\r\nschool, and their lands will soon bear a great price. From hence I\r\nwent with Mr. John Wright (whom the Doctor sent to accompany me in my\r\nfurther inquiry) to Hatfield, in the Province of the Massachusetts;\r\nand found gentlemen there universally desirous to have the school\r\nfixed in Berkshire County in the western part of that Province.\"\r\n\r\nThis region was visited by them, as well as New York. During the\r\nautumn of 1768, by commission of Dr. Wheelock, Mr. Cleaveland, in\r\ncompany with Mr. Allen Mather, also attended a large \"Congress\" of\r\nseveral Indian tribes, at Fort Stanwix. In his report, after referring\r\nto friendly conference with other chiefs, he says: \"I also saw one\r\nfrom Caghnawaga near Montreal, who desired to know if he could get his\r\nson into Dr. Wheelock's school, and manifested a great desire to send\r\nhim. I told him there was talk of the school's going to Cohos. He said\r\nif it should be fixed there, he believed that many of that tribe would\r\nsend their children to it.\"[20] This Canadian chief's statement was\r\nconsidered, most carefully, by Dr. Wheelock. The proper documents were\r\nforwarded with the least practicable delay to the English Trustees,\r\nand elicited the following response:\r\n\r\n      [20] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n    \"London, 3d April, 1769.\r\n\r\n\"Reverend Sir:--Last week we received your letters of the 22d and 23d\r\nDecember, 1768, and 10th of January, 1769; and being convinced how\r\nnecessary it is for the prosperity of your pious institution, as well\r\nas for the peace of your own mind, that a place should be fixed upon\r\nfor the future establishment of your school as soon as possible, we\r\nhave attentively considered the report of Mr. Ebenezer Cleaveland,\r\nwhom you employed to take a view of the several spots proposed for\r\nthat purpose, together with the other papers which have now and\r\nheretofore been transmitted to us relative to that matter; and, upon\r\nweighing the several generous offers and proposals that have been made\r\nto you by gentlemen of different governments for the benevolent\r\npurpose of promoting the important design of your institution, and the\r\nreasons that have been offered or have occurred to us in support of\r\neach, we are unanimously of opinion that the most advantageous\r\nsituation for carrying on the great purposes of your school, will be\r\nin one of the townships belonging to the District of Cowas, in the\r\nGovernment of New Hampshire, agreeable to the proposal of Governor\r\nWentworth and the gentlemen who have generously expressed their\r\nintention of contributing to that design; but whether Haverhill or\r\nOrford may be the most eligible for this purpose, we must leave to\r\nyour judgment to determine. According to the best information we can\r\nprocure of the state of those towns, we think you may possibly give\r\nthe preference to the former, especially if the farm which you mention\r\nas very convenient for an immediate supply of provisions, can be\r\nprocured upon reasonable terms.\r\n\r\n\"We found our opinion, principally, upon this reason, that it appears\r\nto us that Cowas is the most central of the situations that have been\r\nproposed between the Indians of the Six Nations, on the one hand, and\r\nthose of St. Francis and of the other tribes to the eastward, on the\r\nother; and that it is not inferior to any of the rest in other\r\nrespects. For this reason, we cannot but recommend to you to accept\r\nthe offers of Governor Wentworth and the Gentlemen in New Hampshire.\r\nAnd we heartily pray that the same good Providence which has so\r\nremarkably blessed your undertaking hitherto, may continue to protect\r\nand prosper it in its farther progress, and may prolong your life,\r\nthat you may have the satisfaction to see it fixed upon such a plan as\r\nmay afford a reasonable hope of answering all the good purposes you\r\nhave in view.\r\n\r\n    \"We are, Reverend Sir,\r\n\r\n    \"Your most obedient servants,\r\n\r\n    Dartmouth,\r\n    S.

Mr. Wheelock now placed himself in confidential relations\r\nwith two eminent lawyers in New York, William Smith, and his son\r\nWilliam Smith, Jr., the latter of whom, perhaps, may be said to have\r\nleft his impress upon the Constitution of the United States, through\r\nhis distinguished pupil, Gouverneur Morris. The correspondence, at\r\nfirst, seems to have been chiefly with Mr. Smith, Senior. August 6,\r\n1755, he writes to Mr. Wheelock: \"The means for the accomplishment of\r\nso charitable a design seem at present very imperfect.\" He suggests,\r\nthat there is \"no incorporation\" of Mr. Wheelock and the other\r\ngentlemen to whom Mr. More conveyed the property; that the deed\r\ncontains \"no consideration;\" and that the estate is at most only \"for\r\nlife.\" He advises Mr. Wheelock, at least, to procure a better deed,\r\nwhich was afterwards executed by Mrs. More. The death of Mr.\r\nWheelock's most influential and valuable associate trustee,\r\nex-President Williams, only a few days after the conveyance by Mr.\r\nMore, was a severe loss, and a temporary embarrassment to his\r\nassociates. But Mr. Wheelock determined to proceed in his efforts for\r\nan incorporation, relying mainly upon the dictates of his own judgment\r\nfor direction. After the lapse of some five years, in February, 1760,\r\nhe gives the results to Mr. Smith, in language of which the following\r\nis the substance: \"We sent home some years ago for the royal favor of\r\na Charter. Lord Halifax approved the design, but [to save expense]\r\nadvised, instead of a Charter, the establishment of the school by a\r\nlaw of Connecticut Colony, and promised that when sent there it should\r\nbe ratified in Council, which he supposed would be as sufficient as\r\nany act there. Hereupon I attended our Assembly, in May, 1758, with a\r\nmemorial, the prayer of which was granted by the House of\r\nRepresentatives; the Governor and Council negatived it, upon the\r\nground that their action would not be valid, if ratified in England,\r\nbeyond this Colony, and that a corporation within a corporation might\r\nbe troublesome, as Yale College had sometimes been. I am since\r\ninformed that the Earl of Dartmouth has promised, if the matter shall\r\nbe put into a proper channel, to undertake and go through with it at\r\nhis own expense.\"\r\n\r\nThus it appears that Lord Dartmouth was desirous of aiding Mr.\r\nWheelock by his influence, and otherwise, long before being asked by\r\nhim for pecuniary aid. In explanation of the governor's objections, it\r\nshould be stated, that Mr. Wheelock desired such an incorporation as\r\nwould enable him to locate his school in any of the American Colonies,\r\nand that there was just at that period an earnest contest between the\r\ncorporation of Yale College, led by President Clap, and the Colonial\r\ngovernment, in regard to the control of that institution.\r\n\r\nNothing having been accomplished in the meantime, Mr. Wheelock writes\r\nin July, 1763, to his friend, Dr. Erskine, as follows: \"Governor Fitch\r\nprivately proposes my removing my prayer for an incorporation from\r\nthis government [Connecticut]. It is likely we shall delay, it till we\r\nsee the success of our suit for the Royal favor.\" In September\r\nfollowing, he writes to his friend, Mr. De Berdt, in London, that he\r\nhas sent to him \"materials, by General Lyman[22] and Colonel\r\nDyer,\"[23] to enable him to \"make application for an incorporation.\"\r\nUnsuccessful as before in England, for reasons which will become more\r\napparent hereafter, in May, 1764, we find Mr. Wheelock petitioning\r\nthe Connecticut Assembly \"to incorporate\" six gentlemen of the Colony,\r\nincluding George Wyllis, of Hartford, and himself, as legal guardians\r\nof his school. But he did not procure the long-desired incorporation.\r\n\r\n      [22] The distinguished Gen. Phineas Lyman.\r\n\r\n      [23] Hon. Eliphalet Dyer, of Windham.\r\n\r\nIn 1765, being about to send solicitors of charity on a larger scale\r\nto England, Mr. Wheelock decided to make yet one more effort there for\r\nan act of incorporation. A letter from Mr. Smith, written evidently\r\nabout this time, no date being attached, contains advice to Mr.\r\nWheelock in which we trace one of the most prominent features of the\r\nCharter. He proposes, in substance: \"an application to the King for a\r\nshort Charter incorporating. First, A sett of gentlemen in the\r\nColonies near Mr. Wheelock, who shall have all the power of a\r\ncorporation, as to managing estates, supplying vacancies, etc. Second,\r\nAnother sett in England and elsewhere in Europe, who, shall be\r\ncorrespondents of the first sett, and only have the general power of\r\nsecuring donations to be transferred to them.\"\r\n\r\nLord Dartmouth and the other gentlemen in England who were\r\nconstituted, by Mr. Wheelock, a Board of Trust for the moneys\r\ncollected in that country, by Messrs. Occom and Whitaker, seem to have\r\nthought this private incorporation amply sufficient for the security\r\nof these funds. In writing to Mr. Keen, in November, 1767, Mr. (now\r\nDr.) Wheelock alludes to the fact that this gentleman had expressed an\r\nopinion that his successor should be \"in all respects accountable to\r\nthe present Trust.\" Although dissenting from this opinion, Dr.\r\nWheelock seems to have been prudent and conciliatory in his\r\nintercourse with his worthy benefactors, wisely deeming it an object\r\nof primary importance to raise the requisite funds for his operations.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Occom and Whitaker having fulfilled their mission abroad, and\r\ngenerous promises of aid having been made by Governor Wentworth, we\r\nfind Dr. Wheelock, in October, 1768, writing to him as follows: \"As\r\nsoon as the place to fix the school shall have been determined to be\r\nin your Province, I will appoint your Excellency, or the Governor for\r\nthe time being, to be a Trustee on this side the water till a legal\r\nincorporation may be obtained.\" This shows that Dr. Wheelock was not\r\naverse to a judicious admixture of the clerical and lay elements in\r\nthe Board of Trust, although the Trustees named in his will, the germ\r\nof the charter, were clergymen.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion seems to have been most kindly received by Governor\r\nWentworth. Dr. Wheelock now determined to avail himself of the aid of\r\nhis firm and valuable friend, Rev. Dr. Langdon, of Portsmouth. A\r\nletter from him to this gentleman is as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Lebanon, April 7, 1769.\r\n\r\n\"Reverend and dear Sir,--Yours by Captain Cushman is safe arrived, and\r\nI have considered the contents. And for several reasons I am of\r\nopinion that it will be best that the Trustees be the same for the\r\npresent, as I have already appointed in my will, which I have made at\r\nthe desire of the Trust in England, whose names were, with the will,\r\nsome time ago transmitted to them. The affair is very delicate, and as\r\nsuch must be conducted, or it will disgust those worthy gentlemen, and\r\noverset all. Their sentiments of an incorporation have been differing\r\nfrom mine. They have insisted that I should conduct the whole affair\r\nwithout one, and that my successor should be nominated and appointed\r\nby my will. Experience, they think, has fully taught them that, by\r\nmeans of an incorporation, such designs become jobs, and are soon\r\nruined thereby. They choose to hold the moneys collected there in\r\ntheir own hands for this purpose, and accordingly have publicly\r\ndeclared their Trust of the same under their hands and seals, and have\r\ndisposed of it, as their wisdom directed, for the benefit of the\r\nschool. I have, therefore, after much study and consultation in the\r\naffair, appointed two setts of Trustees, namely, those in England who\r\nhave voluntarily condescended to make themselves so, to take care of\r\nwhatever concerns the object in view on that side the water; and a\r\nsett in this vicinity, to take care of and perform whatever shall\r\nconcern it on this side. I have appointed a successor, to take care of\r\nthe school, etc., only till he shall be approved and confirmed by the\r\nconcurrence of both setts of Trustees, or till they all agree in\r\nanother, nominated by either and approved by both, each sett to have\r\npower to supply vacancies in their Trust, made by death or\r\nresignation, by the major vote of the survivors; something like this I\r\nconceive will be most agreeable to the Right Honorable, Honorable, and\r\ngenerous benefactors who have accepted the Trust in England, and I\r\napprehend it will make the design popular and respectable.\r\n\r\n\"The Trustees here will hold and have the disposal of lands given in\r\nAmerica for this use; and I apprehend it will be proper for his\r\nMajesty's Governor of the Province for the time being to be a Trustee,\r\nbut at present I have not light enough to determine a propriety in\r\nmaking his Majesty himself one on this side the water.\r\n\r\n\"I have several reasons, which appear to me weighty, for having the\r\nbody of the Trustees first incorporated in this vicinity.\r\n\r\n\"1. They will be at hand to conduct the affairs of the school,\r\nmissionaries, schoolmasters, etc., till I can get settled in the\r\nwilderness, which will be impracticable, if they are at the distance\r\nof Portsmouth.\r\n\r\n\"2. Several of the Trustees talk of removing with me to settle in that\r\nvicinity; and if so, they may for a time act as a committee, till a\r\nsufficient number suitable for that Trust shall be settled (as you\r\nwill observe will be expedient) near to the school.\r\n\r\n\"3. Till this be done, my connections will likely be such as will\r\noblige me to make frequent visits to these parts, where we may have a\r\nfull meeting of the Board without any expense.\r\n\r\n\"4. Gentlemen here have been so much concerned in Indian affairs, that\r\nI suppose it not to be immodest to say _ceteris paribus_, they are at\r\npresent better qualified to act therein than those who will have to\r\nencounter a thousand dangers and difficulties before unthought of.\r\n\r\n\"5. By having the body corporate here, I can claim a valuable\r\nsubscription of £400 or £500 for the use and support of the school,\r\npayable as soon as it becomes a body corporate, besides a tenement in\r\nthis place, given for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n\"If the school should once be settled in those parts, it is likely\r\npopulation will proceed with much greater rapidity than ever, and the\r\nwhole will be soon effected.\r\n\r\n\"I design to consult some gentlemen of the law relative to an\r\nincorporation, and get a rough draught made, with a view to save time\r\nif the School should be fixed in your Province. Please to discourse\r\nhis Excellency of thoughts I have here suggested, and transmit such\r\nremarks as he shall please to make thereon. Please to commend my\r\nrespects suitably to him, and accept the same yourself from, reverend\r\nand dear sir,\r\n\r\n    Your Friend and Brother, etc.,\r\n    \"Eleazar Wheelock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Wyllis and Esquire Ledyard,\" of Hartford, were among Dr.\r\nWheelock's legal advisers in 1768, and probably at this period.\r\n\r\nJune 7, 1769, we find Dr. Wheelock addressing Governor Wentworth as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"I have been making some attempt to form a Charter, in which some\r\nproper respect may be shown to those generous benefactors in England\r\nwho have condescended to patronize this school, and I want to be\r\ninformed whether you think it consistent to make the Trust in England\r\na distinct corporation, with power to hold real estate, etc., for the\r\nuses and purposes of this school.\"\r\n\r\nBut the impress of Governor Wentworth does not appear till a somewhat\r\nlater period. August 22, 1769, Dr. Wheelock informs him that he is\r\nabout to present him a \"rough draught\" of a Charter, for an \"Academy,\"\r\nadding this somewhat significant postscript: \"Sir, if you think proper\r\nto use the word College instead of Academy in the Charter, I shall be\r\nwell pleased with it.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Wheelock's son-in-law, Mr. Alexander Phelps, and Rev. Dr. Whitaker\r\nseem to have been the principal agents to confer with Governor\r\nWentworth in regard to the Charter.\r\n\r\nOctober 18, 1769, he gives his views at length, in a letter to Dr.\r\nWheelock, advising some amendments. Proposing some additions to the\r\nBoard of Trust, he says: \"The nomination of the Provincial officers I\r\nstrongly recommend, though I do not insist upon. It was indeed\r\nresolved on my side that the Governor should be one\" of the Board.\r\n\"That I did not mention any other than the Governor can by no means be\r\npreclusive. Neither did I so intend it. The three Provincial officers\r\nwill be a natural defense, honor and security to the institution.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter indicates that Governor Wentworth had eminent\r\nlegal counsel:\r\n\r\n\"Rev. Sir: I have had an opportunity of conferring with Colonel Phelps\r\non the affair of the College proposed to be erected here. You'll find\r\nsome alterations in the scheme and draft of the Charter; they are\r\nsupposed to be amendments, and I think they, to say the least, will\r\nnot be impediments. I cannot stay to enumerate them; the Charter will\r\nshow them and the Colonel will be able to explain the grounds and\r\nreasons of them. I have spent some considerable time with the Governor\r\nto form the plan in such a manner as will make it most beneficial, and\r\nto prevail on him to make such concessions as would suit the gentlemen\r\nwith you. I am apt to think the plan will be more serviceable as it\r\nnow stands than as it was before.\r\n\r\nI shall be glad to serve the cause, and have persuaded Colonel Phelps\r\nto communicate it before the finishing stroke, though it will cost him\r\nanother journey. I have only to add that I am, with great esteem,\r\n\r\n    \"Your most obedient humble servant,\r\n    \"William Parker.\r\n    \"Portsmouth, October 28, 1769.\"\r\n\r\nSix Connecticut clergymen, selected by Dr. Wheelock, with one member\r\nof the Connecticut Colonial government, Governor Wentworth, with three\r\nof his Council, and the Speaker of the New Hampshire House of\r\nRepresentatives, were constituted the first Board of Trust. This\r\narrangement, the result of friendly negotiation, appears to have been\r\nsatisfactory to both parties.\r\n\r\nOctober 25, 1769, Dr. Wheelock writes to Governor Wentworth,\r\nexpressing much satisfaction with his \"catholic views,\" and warm\r\nfriendship, as indicated by his letter of the 18th, and says: \"If your\r\nExcellency shall see fit in your wisdom and goodness to complete the\r\nCharter desired, and it will be the least satisfaction to you to\r\nchristen the House to be built after your own name, it will be\r\nexceedingly grateful to me, and I believe to all concerned.\" He deems\r\nit important that the public should understand, \"that the benevolent\r\ncharities are not designed to be applied merely and exclusively to the\r\nadvancement of sectaries, with a fixed view to discourage the\r\nEstablished Church of England.\" It should here be remarked that\r\nthree of the original Trustees of the College were nominally\r\nEpiscopalians, and the remaining nine were, most or all, nominally\r\nCongregationalists, although some had Presbyterian tendencies.\r\n\r\nIn writing to Lord Dartmouth, March 12, 1770, after referring to the\r\n\"enclosed copy of incorporation,\" which was dated December 13, 1769,\r\nPresident Wheelock says: \"Governor Wentworth thought best to reject\r\nthat clause in my draught of the Charter which gave the Honorable\r\nTrust in England equal power with the Trustees here to nominate and\r\nappoint the president, from time to time, apprehending it would make\r\nthe body too unwieldy, but he cheerfully consented that I should\r\nexpress my gratitude and duty to your Lordship, by christening after\r\nyour name; and as there seemed to be danger of many embarrassments, in\r\nmany ways, in the present ruffled and distempered state of the\r\nkingdom, I thought prudent to embrace the first opportunity to\r\naccomplish it.\" The letter indicates that Dr. Wheelock determined what\r\nshould be the name of the institution without conferring with his\r\ndistinguished benefactor on that point.\r\n\r\nThat the English Trustees were somewhat dissatisfied, temporarily,\r\nwith the measure of responsibility assumed by Dr. Wheelock, there is\r\nno doubt. But nearly perfect harmony was restored, by the prudence of\r\nthat excellent diplomatist. In writing to these gentlemen, June 20,\r\n1771; he says: \"I am confident that, had you been upon the spot, you\r\nwould have approved every step I have taken, unless it was my attempt\r\nto effect so great an affair as settling in this wilderness in so\r\nshort a time, which the event has fully justified, although my trials\r\nhave been very great.\" He also expresses the opinion, that, if they\r\nwill compare his plan proposed in his former letters with his\r\nprocedure since, they will find that he has \"invariably kept the same\r\nobject in view.\" Later records indicate that President Wheelock still\r\nnumbered Lord Dartmouth and others of the English Board among his\r\nfaithful friends. Although not officially connected with the college,\r\nthey evidently cherished an abiding interest in its welfare.\r\n\r\nThe Charter, so remarkable in its history, is a valuable and an\r\nenduring monument to the genius, skill, and learning of its\r\ndistinguished framers.[24] Like the Charters of Harvard and Yale, it\r\nindicates that the clergy were regarded, generally, as the best\r\ndepositaries of educational trusts. In the former case, the \"teaching\r\nelders\" of the \"six next adjoining towns\" were ex-officio,\r\n\"Overseers;\" in the latter, the original Trustees were all clergymen.\r\nIt may safely be asserted that, of the large number of eminent\r\ngentlemen, who, as Trustees, have administered the affairs of\r\nDartmouth College, none have been more eminent for their wisdom or\r\nfidelity than the reverend clergy.\r\n\r\n      [24] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Handwritten letter]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT WHEELOCK'S PERSONAL EXPLORATIONS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.--LOCATION\r\nAT HANOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his \"Narrative\" for 1771, President Wheelock tells the story of\r\nDartmouth's location in the Granite State so plainly and\r\nsatisfactorily, that we can do no better than to give his own\r\nrecapitulation and condensation of the leading facts.\r\n\r\n\"The smiles of heaven upon this school were such that it appeared\r\nquite necessary to build to accommodate it; and the plan which I laid\r\nfor this purpose was to secure a sufficient tract of good land for the\r\nonly use and benefit of the school, and that the English charity\r\nscholars should be led to turn their exercises for the relaxation of\r\ntheir minds from their studies, and for the preservation of health,\r\nfrom such exercises as have been frequently used by students for these\r\npurposes, to such manual labor as might be subservient to the support\r\nof the school, thereby effectually removing the deep prejudices, so\r\nuniversal in the minds of the Indians, against going into the business\r\nof husbandry.\"\r\n\r\n\"The necessity of building, and also that I proposed to fix it at any\r\ndistance where the design might be best served by it, became publicly\r\nknown, whereupon great numbers in Connecticut and in neighboring\r\nProvinces made generous offers to invite the settlement of it in their\r\nrespective places. In which affair I employed proper agents to view\r\nthe several situations proposed, and hear the several arguments and\r\nreasons that might be offered by the solicitors for it, and make a\r\nfaithful report of the same.\r\n\r\n\"The magistracy of the city of Albany offered an interest estimated at\r\n£2,300 sterling, besides private donations, which it was supposed\r\nwould be large, to fix it in that city. Several other generous offers\r\nwere made to fix it in that vicinity. His Excellency, Sir Francis\r\nBernard, Governor of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay, in\r\ncompany with two others, offered 2,000 acres of good land in a central\r\ntown[25] in the county of Berkshire in said Province. To which were\r\nadded several other donations, amounting in the whole to 2,800 acres\r\nof land, and a subscription said to be about £800 sterling. Also\r\ngenerous offers were made to it in Stockbridge and other towns in that\r\nProvince. Several generous offers were made by particular towns and\r\nparishes in the Colony of Connecticut, and particularly to continue it\r\nwhere it had its rise. But the country being so filled up with\r\ninhabitants, it was not practicable to get so large a tract of lands\r\nas was thought to be most convenient and useful for it in those old\r\nsettlements. The Honorable Trust in England gave the preference to the\r\nwestern part of the Province of New Hampshire, on Connecticut river,\r\nas the site of the school.\"\r\n\r\n      [25] Pittsfield.\r\n\r\nBefore this period he \"began to be convinced by many weighty reasons\r\nthat a greater proportion of English youth must be prepared for\r\nmissionaries to take entirely the lead of the affairs in the\r\nwilderness.\" He also was deeply impressed with the want of ministers\r\nin a large number of towns, nearly two hundred in all, just then newly\r\nsettling in the Connecticut valley. In view of all the circumstances,\r\nand especially the fact that there was a disposition on the part of\r\nmany young men who had the ministry in view to seek preparation for it\r\nelsewhere, than at Yale or Harvard, he felt it his duty to adhere to\r\nhis plan of extension.\r\n\r\n\"As neither the Honorable Trust in England nor the Charter had fixed\r\nupon the particular town or spot on which the buildings should be\r\nerected, wherefore to complete the matter, as soon as the ways and\r\nstreams would allow, I took the Rev. Mr. Pomeroy, and Esq. [Samuel]\r\nGilbert (a gentleman of known ability for such a purpose) with me to\r\nexamine thoroughly, and compare the several places proposed, within\r\nthe limits prescribed for fifty or sixty miles on or near said River;\r\nand to hear all the reasons and arguments that could be offered in\r\nfavor of each of them, in which service we faithfully spent eight\r\nweeks. And in consequence of our report and representation of facts,\r\nthe Trustees unanimously agreed that the southwesterly corner of\r\nHanover adjoining upon Lebanon was the place above any to fix it in;\r\nand that for many reasons, namely, it is most central on the River,\r\nand most convenient for transportation up and down the River; as near\r\nas any to the Indians; convenient for communication with Crown Point\r\non Lake Champlain, and with Canada. The situation is on a beautiful\r\nplain, the soil fertile and easy of cultivation. The tract on which\r\nthe college is fixed, lying mostly in one body, and convenient for\r\nimprovement, in the towns of Hanover and Lebanon, contains upwards of\r\n3,000 acres.\"\r\n\r\nWe quote from official records:\r\n\r\n    \"Portsmouth, New Hampshire, July 5, 1770.\r\n\r\n\"We, the subscribers nominated Trustees of Dartmouth College, in the\r\nCharter of said college, and being duly qualified as directed by said\r\nCharter, have taken into consideration the places whereon said college\r\nmight be situated; and do hereby certify that it is our advice,\r\nopinion and vote that said Dartmouth College be situated and erected\r\nupon lands in the township of Hanover upon Connecticut river in the\r\nProvince aforesaid, provided the lands, moneys, and other aids\r\nsubscribed for the use of said Dartmouth College, if placed in Hanover\r\naforesaid, be firmly and securely conveyed to the Trustees of and for\r\nthe use of said College.

Pitkin,\r\n    \"James Lockwood,\r\n    \"Timothy Pitkin,\r\n    \"John Smalley.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Coos\" region now demands our more careful attention.\r\n\r\nWhile southern New England was largely occupied by emigrants from the\r\nMother Country, and their descendants, in the seventeenth century,\r\nmuch of its northern portions, and especially the rich valley of the\r\nupper Connecticut, was still covered with the virgin forests. As early\r\nas 1752, Theodore Atkinson (whose name will become more familiar to\r\nus) and others in Eastern New Hampshire, had formed a plan for\r\nacquiring and colonizing the best portion of this unoccupied, but\r\nfertile and inviting, basin. But the proud and lordly Indian disputed\r\ntheir right to invade this ancient and charming hunting-ground, whose\r\nmeadows almost spontaneously produced the choicest corn, and they\r\ndesisted from their purpose.\r\n\r\nThe immediate occasion of the settlement of this part of the\r\nConnecticut valley was the French war. In the progress of that war,\r\nthe New England troops had cut a road from the older settlements in\r\nthe south part of the Province through Charlestown, then called No. 4,\r\nto Crown Point. The soldiers in passing through this valley became\r\nacquainted with its fertility and value.\r\n\r\nThe soil of Eastern Connecticut being exhausted in some measure, her\r\nhardy and enterprising yeomanry now gladly turned toward a region\r\nwhere honest industry would find a surer and better reward. Many of\r\nthem knew the value of religion by a vital experience, and all knew\r\nthe value of sound learning by experience or close observation.\r\n\r\nThe leading founders of Hanover were of the highly respectable Freeman\r\nfamily, of Mansfield, Conn. The early history of this family in\r\nAmerica connects it with the Bradford and Prince families. The pioneer\r\nsettler at Hanover was Edmund Freeman. Of this worthy and enterprising\r\nman, sincere Christian, earnest patriot, and valuable coadjutor of\r\nPresident Wheelock, it is said: \"Of distinguished uprightness and\r\nintegrity, he commanded universal respect and esteem.\" Hon. Jonathan\r\nFreeman was his brother.\r\n\r\nAnother family to whom Hanover is largely indebted for its solid\r\nfoundations bears the no less distinguished name of Storrs, also of\r\nMansfield, the old ancestral home of all, or nearly all, of that name,\r\nwho in various ways have been conspicuous in giving \"strength and\r\nbeauty\" to American institutions. Of Joseph Storrs, an early donor to\r\nDartmouth, it is said: \"He was the younger son of Samuel Storrs the\r\nsecond, and grandson of Samuel Storrs the elder, from whom all of the\r\nname in America are descended, excepting one family near Richmond, Va.\r\nHe was a member of the first board of selectmen of the town of\r\nHanover.\"\r\n\r\nThe town contained about twenty families at the period of which we are\r\nwriting. The relations of some other early settlers with President\r\nWheelock deserve equally careful notice. John Wright, from Lebanon,\r\nConn., was a man of marked ability and decided religious character. He\r\nwas deeply interested in the new college, and as pioneer explorer and\r\nartisan rendered its founder invaluable aid. His name also heads the\r\nlist of the Hanover donors of lands.\r\n\r\nDavid Woodward, formerly a parishioner of President Wheelock, and\r\nafterward widely known for his strong mind, his public spirit, and\r\npatriotism, also coöperated earnestly with him while he was laying\r\nfoundations. His house appears to have furnished the venerable\r\npresident his first headquarters, while planning future operations.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Wright, from Coventry, Conn., was a relation of John\r\nWright. His descendants have honored the college, as some of them\r\nstill honor the memory of an ancestor, whose name is inseparably and\r\nprominently connected with the civil and religious history of the\r\ntown. His heart and hand were with President Wheelock, and his log\r\ncabin was a welcome resting-place.\r\n\r\nJames Murch, one of the more enterprising among the early settlers,\r\nwas also from Connecticut, where he had formed some acquaintance with\r\nPresident Wheelock and his plans. Upon him it seems to have devolved,\r\nin some measure at least, to set forth in homely but vigorous language\r\nthe leading attractions of this locality.\r\n\r\nReverting to the \"Narrative,\" we give President Wheelock's own graphic\r\naccount of labor and privation, which, in view of all the\r\ncircumstances, has few parallels in history:\r\n\r\n\"After I had finished this tour [of exploration] and made a short stay\r\nat home, to settle some affairs, I returned again into the wilderness,\r\nto make provision for the removal and settlement of my family and\r\nschool there before winter. I arrived in August [1770], and found\r\nmatters in such a situation as at once convinced me of the necessity\r\nof being myself upon the spot. And as there was no house conveniently\r\nnear, I made a hutt of logs about eighteen feet square, without stone,\r\nbrick, glass, or nail, and with thirty, forty, and sometimes fifty\r\nlaborers appointed to their respective departments, I betook myself to\r\na campaign. I set some to build a house for myself and family, of\r\nforty by thirty-two feet, and one story high, and others to build a\r\nhouse for my students of eighty by thirty-two, and two stories high.\"\r\n\r\nHis family and about twenty or thirty students arriving before the\r\ncompletion of his house, difficulty in locating having arisen, he\r\nsays: \"I housed my stuff with my wife and the females of my family in\r\nmy hutt. My sons and students made booths and beds of hemlock boughs,\r\nand in this situation we continued about a month, till the 29th day of\r\nOctober, when I removed with my family to my house.\"\r\n\r\nA few last words to one who for a long period had regarded his work\r\nwith more than fraternal interest, and himself with more than\r\nfraternal affection, fitly portray the state of President Wheelock's\r\nmind and heart in those days of toil and trial and hope:\r\n\r\n\"From my Hutt in Hanover Woods in the Province of New Hampshire,\r\nAugust 27, 1770.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sir:--I long to see you and spend one day with you on the\r\naffairs of the Redeemer's kingdom. It would be vain to attempt to tell\r\nyou of the many and great affairs I am at present involved in, in all\r\nwhich I have had much of the loving-kindness, faithfulness, and\r\ngoodness of God. I am this day sending for my family and expect the\r\nhouse will be made comfortable for their reception by the time they\r\narrive. My prospects are, by the goodness of God, vastly encouraging.\r\nA series of merciful occurrences has persuaded me that God designs\r\ngreat good to his church among English as well as Indians by this\r\ninstitution. I was informed at Boston, in my late journey, that the\r\nCommissioners have plenty of their constituents' money which lies\r\nuseless for want of missionaries, and for many weighty reasons I have\r\nthought that the Redeemer's cause might be much served by Mr.\r\nKirtland's[26] going to their pay. This was an important point I\r\nwished to consult you in. Likely your own thoughts may suggest some\r\nreasons and such as you shall think sufficient without my disclosing\r\nmany that are not public. If you think favorably of it, please to\r\npropose it to them, as you will likely have an opportunity for before\r\nyou leave the continent. I have a number fitted and fitting for\r\nmissions more than the fund already collected will support, and if\r\nthat may be saved, and at the same time uniformity and good agreement\r\nbetween the Boards is promoted, it will be well. I wrote you from\r\nDedham on my late journey from Boston. I rejoice to hear that your bow\r\nyet abides in strength; that God has once more made you useful in\r\nAmerica. I am chained here; there is no probability that the buildings\r\nwill be seasonably and well accomplished if I should leave them. I\r\ndon't expect to see you till we meet in the general convention on the\r\nother shore. Please to favor me with a line, and your thoughts on the\r\nquestion proposed. You may send from Boston by the Northfield post,\r\ndirected to me at Hanover in this Province. Oh, how glad should I be\r\nto see you in this wilderness!\r\n\r\n      [26] The modern orthography is Kirkland.\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir, farewell.\r\n\r\n    \"I am yours in the dear Jesus.\r\n    \"Eleazar Wheelock.\r\n    \"Rev. George Whitefield.\"\r\n\r\nThere appears to have been no subsequent meeting, on earth, of these\r\neminent coadjutors in all good works. The one was called to his reward\r\nabove, just as the other was beginning to enjoy the fruition of his\r\nlabors on earth. Few names deserve more honor, in connection with the\r\nfounding of Dartmouth College, than that of\r\n\r\n    George Whitefield.[27]\r\n\r\n      [27] Many things, which cannot be specified, illustrating the\r\n           history of this period and others, are necessarily placed\r\n           in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUND PLAN OF THE FIRST COLLEGE EDIFICE:\r\n\r\nErected in 1770, near what is now the Southeast corner of the\r\nCommon.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCOMMENCEMENT OF OPERATIONS.--COURSE OF STUDY.--POLICY OF\r\nADMINISTRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstruction at Dartmouth appears to have commenced in December\r\nfollowing the removal, with four classes in attendance.\r\n\r\nIn writing to Dr. Erskine, December 7, 1770, President Wheelock says:\r\n\"I am now removed into the wilderness with my family, and about thirty\r\nstudents, English and Indians, who are all designed for the Indian\r\nservice.\" After referring to the erection of a house for his family,\r\nand \"another\" for his students, he says: \"I have also built a\r\nschool-house, which is convenient. My nearest neighbor in the town is\r\ntwo and one half miles from me. I can see nothing but the lofty pines\r\nabout me. My family and students are in good health, and well pleased\r\nwith a solitude so favorable to their studies.\"\r\n\r\nIn President Wheelock's account-book, David Huntington, Thomas\r\nKendall, Ebenezer Gurley, Augustine Hibbard, James Dean, and Joseph\r\nGrover, are charged with tuition from various dates, ranging from\r\nDecember 7th to December 14th. The rate is _1s. 4d._ per week,\r\n\"deducting abscences.\" In Connecticut, the tuition, for classical\r\ninstruction in the school, had been _1s. 6d._ per week.\r\n\r\nThe following, from President Wheelock to a distant correspondent,\r\nindicates sufficient patronage of the new institution:\r\n\r\n    \"Hanover, December 3, 1770.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir,--Your son, with companion, are safely arrived. I've sent\r\nback part of my students to Connecticut. I've just got studies fitted,\r\nand made provision for the support of the rest of them. The great\r\ndifficulty in taking your son is the want of provisions in this\r\nstarved country. I send to Northfield and Montague for my bread, and\r\nexpect supply chiefly from thence.\"\r\n\r\nThe facilities for acquiring classical and scientific education appear\r\nto have been substantially the same at Dartmouth, at the outset, as in\r\nother American colleges of that period.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Newton and Franklin had a marked, if not\r\ncontrolling, influence upon the thought of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nNo American college, perhaps, felt this influence more than President\r\nWheelock's Alma Mater, in which Franklin took a deep interest.\r\n\r\nAt the period of the founding of Dartmouth, we find that, in Yale\r\nCollege, the Faculty consisted of Dr. Daggett, who was President, and\r\nProfessor of Divinity; Rev. Nehemiah Strong, Professor of Mathematics\r\nand Natural Philosophy, and two or three tutors.\r\n\r\nPresident Wheelock doubtless had his Alma Mater especially in mind, in\r\nplanning the curriculum of Dartmouth. He was himself Professor of\r\nDivinity, as well as President. His first associate in instruction,\r\nwho acted in the capacity of tutor, was Mr. Bezaleel Woodward, who had\r\ngraduated at Yale College in 1764, during the presidency of Rev.\r\nThomas Clap, of whom his associate in the Faculty, the future\r\nPresident Stiles, says: \"In Mathematics and Natural Philosophy I have\r\nreason to think he was not equaled by more than one man in America.\"\r\nThe fact that Mr. Woodward was subsequently, for many years, a highly\r\nesteemed professor of Mathematics in the college, indicates that he\r\nwas a worthy pupil of his distinguished teacher.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the college was highly favored, in its\r\nbeginnings, in having a president who had been, while at college,\r\ndistinguished as a classical scholar, and in later life as an able and\r\na learned divine, aided by a younger teacher, whose scientific\r\nattainments well qualified him for the duties of his position.\r\n\r\nThe first preceptor of the Charity School, at Hanover, was David\r\nMcClure, who had recently graduated at Yale College. He was an able\r\nand a successful teacher. The various relations of the school and\r\ncollege were so intimate at this period, that it is nearly impossible\r\nto dissociate them. The word \"school,\" as used by President Wheelock,\r\nfrequently includes the college.\r\n\r\nThree of Dartmouth's first class were prepared for college at the\r\n\"Indian Charity School\" in Lebanon, and passed their first three years\r\nat Yale.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from an eminent teacher, referred to in a\r\nprevious chapter, addressed to President Wheelock, introduces their\r\nonly new classmate:\r\n\r\n\"Lebanon, August 10, 1770.\r\n\r\n\"Rev. Sir: The bearer, Samuel Gray, entered my school about two years\r\nago, and in that time has been about four months absent. He was well\r\nfitted for college when he was first under my care, and having applied\r\nhimself with proper diligence to his studies, and being favored with a\r\ngenius somewhat better than common, has made a progress in his\r\nlearning answerable to his industry. He will be found upon examination\r\nto be pretty well acquainted with Virgil, Tully, and Horace. He is\r\nlikewise able to construe any part of the Greek Testament. He parses\r\nand makes Latin rather better than common. He has been through the\r\ntwelve first books of Homer, but, as 't is more than a year since he\r\nrecited that author, am afraid he has lost the greater part of what he\r\nthen understood pretty well. In Arithmetic, vulgar and decimal, he is\r\nwell versed. I have likewise taught him Trigonometry, Altimetry,\r\nLongimetry, Navigation, Surveying, Dialing, and Gauging. He has been\r\nthrough Martin's 'Philosophical Grammar' twice,--the greater part of\r\nwhich he understands very well. He has likewise studied Whiston's\r\n'Astronomy,' all except the calculations, which he doth not\r\nunderstand. He is likewise pretty well acquainted with Geography and\r\nthe use of the globes. He went through Watts' 'Logic' last winter, but\r\nhaving no taste for that study, or rather an aversion to it, he is not\r\nso well skilled in that as in some other parts of learning. About a\r\nyear ago he went through so much of rhetoric as is contained in the\r\n'Preceptor,' but suppose he has forgot the most of it. Upon the whole,\r\nthough he may not, perhaps, be so well versed in some parts of\r\nlearning as the class which he proposes to enter, yet if he applies\r\nhimself to his studies with proper diligence, he will be rather an\r\nhonor than a disgrace to any college where he shall be graduated. I\r\nought in justice to him to add, that he is an orderly, well-behaved\r\nyouth, and has conducted so well in my school ever since he has been\r\nwith me that I have never had the least difference with him on any\r\naccount whatever.\r\n\r\n    \"I am, reverend sir, with much esteem,\r\n    \"Your most humble servant,\r\n    \"Nathan Tisdale.\r\n\r\n\"P. S. I have another pupil whom I shall offer for admission into your\r\ncollege at the end of the vacancy [vacation], if I can fit him by that\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA portion of a letter from a somewhat distinguished clergyman and\r\nteacher, Rev. Simeon Williams, of Windham, N. H., introducing several\r\nprominent members of the class of 1774, is worthy of notice here,\r\nalthough written in 1772. In connection with the reply, it throws\r\nadditional light upon the first prescribed course of study at\r\nDartmouth. After expressions indicating confidence that President\r\nWheelock will attend, faithfully, to the welfare of the young men, the\r\nlanguage is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"When they first came to my school they had read enough of Virgil and\r\nthe lower Latin classics, together with a sufficient knowledge of the\r\nGreek Testament, to enable them to pass into any of the colleges as\r\nFreshmen. But when their fathers informed me that they intended their\r\nresidence only for two years, and that they expected, if they were\r\nunder my care, I would qualify them in all the parts of the Freshman\r\nand Sophomore years, so as they might with honor and ability enter the\r\nJunior class, with mature deliberation, I undertook the arduous task.\r\nThe first year I confined their studies to Virgil, Cicero's\r\n'Orations,' together with their improvement in Geography, Rhetoric,\r\nand occasional declamations, etc. This second year they have been\r\nreading Homer and Horace, Cicero de Oratore, and a part of Xenophon. I\r\nhave also carefully instructed them in all the four parts of Logic\r\nfrom Doctor Finlay's 'Latin Compend,' expounding the same by familiar\r\nlectures, for the most part extracted from Mr. Locke and Doctor Watts.\r\nThere is one kind of study which this last year they have been much\r\nemployed in,--I mean double translation,--their improvement therein\r\nwill appear to you by casting your eye on their various manuscripts. I\r\nwould observe to you that I have not introduced them to the knowledge\r\nof mathematical learning, knowing it is most usual in colleges to put\r\nthem to those studies in the Junior year.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply President Wheelock says: \"We have examined the youth you\r\nsent, and find them deficient in several parts of learning which the\r\n[Junior] class have made some proficiency in, viz., Mathematics,\r\nGeography, and parsing Greek. They have studied Tullie de Oratore, and\r\nXenophon, and some in Homer, more than that class have done. On the\r\nwhole I have concluded to take them into that class, only with this\r\ncondition, that they recite those things in which they are deficient\r\nwith the Sophomore class while their own class recite other parts in\r\nwhich they exceed them.\" The studies of the Senior year do not appear\r\nto have differed materially from those of other colleges, of that\r\nperiod. Jonathan Edwards was a favorite author in metaphysics and\r\ntheology.\r\n\r\nPresident Wheelock in his \"Narrative,\" for 1771, gives the following\r\nlucid statement of the policy and aims of the school and college: \"It\r\nis earnestly recommended to the students both in college and school,\r\n\r\n\"1. That all the English students in the college and school treat the\r\nIndian children with care, tenderness and kindness, as younger\r\nbrethren, and as may be most conducive to the great ends proposed.\r\n\r\n\"2. That they turn the course of their diversions and exercises for\r\ntheir health to the practice of some manual arts, or cultivation of\r\ngardens, and other lands, at the proper hours of leisure and\r\nintermission from study and vacancies in the college and school.\r\n\r\n\"3. That no English scholar, whether supported by charity or\r\notherwise, shall, at any time, speak diminutively of the practice of\r\nlabor, or by any means cast contempt upon it, or by word or action\r\nendeavor to discredit or discourage the same, on penalty of his being\r\nobliged, at the discretion of the president or tutor, to perform the\r\nsame or the equivalent to that which he attempted to discredit; or\r\nelse (if he be not a charity scholar) to hire the same done by others,\r\nor, in case of refusal and obstinacy in this offense, that he be\r\ndismissed from college, and denied all the privileges and honors of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"4. That no scholar shall be employed in labor in the hours of study,\r\nor so as to interrupt him in his studies, unless upon special\r\nemergencies, and with liberty from the president or a tutor.\r\n\r\n\"5. That accounts be faithfully kept of all the labor so done by them,\r\neither for the procuring provisions for the support of the college and\r\nschool, or that which shall be for real and lasting advantage to this\r\ninstitution; and such accounts shall be properly audited, and a record\r\nkept of the same for the benefit of such scholars, if they should be\r\ncalled by the providence of God to withdraw from their purpose of\r\nserving as missionaries in the wilderness, or to leave the service\r\nbefore they have reasonably compensated the expense of their\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\"6. That such as are not charity scholars, but pay for their\r\neducation, may have liberty to labor for the benefit of the\r\ninstitution at such times as are assigned to charity scholars, and the\r\njust value of their labor be accounted towards the expense of their\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\"7. That no Freshman shall be taken off, or prevented labor, by any\r\nerrand for an under-graduate, without liberty obtained from the\r\npresident or a tutor.\r\n\r\n\"_N. B._ Occasional errands and services for the college and school\r\nare not designed to be accounted, nor their procuring fuel for their\r\nfires, and things equivalent for their own and their chamber's use in\r\nparticular, nor anything which shall not be of real or lasting benefit\r\nfor the whole, unless in cases where they are incapacitated for labor,\r\nand yet are able to perform such errands for or in the room of those\r\nwho can and do labor in their stead.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly. That this Indian Charity School, connected with Dartmouth\r\nCollege, be constantly hereafter and forever called and known by the\r\nname of 'Moor's School.'\r\n\r\n\"Moreover poor youth, who shall seek an education here, at their own\r\nexpense, may not only have the advantage of paying any part of that by\r\nturning their necessary diversions to manual labor, but also, as all\r\nthat will be paid by such as support themselves will be disposed of\r\nfor the support of the Indian, or other charity scholars, therefore,\r\nwhatever clothing or provisions shall be necessary for the school will\r\nbe good pay at a reasonable price.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency Governor Wentworth, among many other expressions of\r\nhis care and zeal to preserve the purity and secure the well-being of\r\nthis seminary against such evils as have been the ruin of, or at least\r\nhave a very threatening aspect upon others which have come within his\r\nknowledge, has insisted upon it as a condition of location, to which\r\nall the trustees have cheerfully subscribed, that wherever it should\r\nbe fixed, there should be a society of at least three miles square,\r\nwhich should be under the jurisdiction of the college, that thereby\r\nunwholesome inhabitants may be prevented settling, and all hurtful or\r\ndangerous connections with them, or practices among them may be\r\nseasonably discovered and prevented in a legal way.[28]\r\n\r\n      [28] The town of Hanover, at three different times within the next\r\n           twenty-five years, by their vote sanctioned this\r\n           incorporation of the \"College District.\" But the plan was\r\n           never favorably regarded, apparently, by the New Hampshire\r\n           Legislature.\r\n\r\n\"As this institution is primarily designed to christianize the\r\nheathen, that is, to form the minds and manners of their children to\r\nthe rules of religion and virtue; and to educate pious youth of the\r\nEnglish to bear the Redeemer's name among them in the wilderness; and\r\nsecondarily to educate meet persons for the sacred work of the\r\nministry, in the churches of Christ among the English; so it is of the\r\nlast and very special importance, that all who shall be admitted here\r\nin any capacity, and especially for an education, be of sober,\r\nblameless and religious behavior, that neither Indian children nor\r\nothers may be in danger of infection by examples which are not\r\nsuitable for their imitation. And accordingly I think it proper to let\r\nthe world know there is no encouragement given that such as are vain,\r\nidle, trifling, flesh-pleasing, or such as are on any account vicious\r\nor immoral, will be admitted here; or, if such should by disguising\r\nthemselves obtain admittance, that they will not be allowed to\r\ncontinue members after they are known to be such; nor will it be well\r\ntaken, if, on any pretense whatever, any shall attempt to introduce or\r\nimpose any youth upon this seminary, whose character shall be\r\nincongruous to, and militates against, the highest, chiefest, and\r\ndearest interests of the first objects of it.\r\n\r\n\"And it is my purpose, by the grace of God, to leave nothing undone,\r\nwithin my power, which is suitable to be done, that this school of the\r\nprophets may be and long continue to be a pure fountain.\r\n\r\n\"And I do with all my heart will this my purpose to all my successors\r\nin the presidency of this seminary, to the latest posterity; and it is\r\nmy last will never to be revoked, and to God I commit it, and my only\r\nhope and confidence for the execution of it is in Him alone, who has\r\nalready done great things for it and does still own it as his cause;\r\nand blessed be his name that every present member of it, as well as\r\ngreat numbers abroad, I trust, do join their hearty Amen with me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS TO THE DEATH OF PRESIDENT WHEELOCK.--PROMINENT FEATURES OF\r\nHIS CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foundations being completed, the superstructure now claims our\r\nattention. We give somewhat full details of affairs during the opening\r\nyears. The following is an extract from a letter from Mr. M'Clare to\r\nhis early friend, General Knox, dated at Hanover, March 20, 1771:\r\n\r\n\"The winter has been very moderate and the heavens clear and serene.\r\nThe situation is much more agreeable than I imagined it would be last\r\nfall, before I set out from Connecticut. The number of the students in\r\nthe college and school is about thirty. I have at present the care of\r\nthe Grammar School, and I find no small pleasure in 'teaching the\r\nyoung idea how to shoot.' Heaven has remarkably smiled upon the\r\ngenerous and pious design of the Reverend Doctor, and supported it\r\namidst numberless difficulties and embarrassments, and it affords a\r\nprospect of being in time a great and extensive blessing to this part\r\nof the world and to the tawny inhabitants of our continent.\"\r\n\r\nThe first Commencement, in August, 1771, attracted a large audience,\r\nincluding many from a distance, among them Governor Wentworth. Dr.\r\nLangdon had previously manifested his deep interest in the college by\r\na personal visit.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Narrative,\" for the period from May, 1771, to September, 1772,\r\nPresident Wheelock says:\r\n\r\n\"I have now finished (so far as to render comfortable and decent) the\r\nbuilding to accommodate my students, of eighty by thirty-two feet, and\r\nhave done it in the plainest and cheapest manner, which furnishes\r\nsixteen comfortable rooms, besides a kitchen, hall, and store-room. I\r\nhave also built a saw-mill and grist-mill, which appear to be well\r\ndone, and are the property of the school, and will likely afford a\r\npretty annual income to it. I have also built two barns, one of\r\ntwenty-eight by thirty-two feet, the other of fifty-five by forty, and\r\nfifteen feet post. I have also raised, and expect to finish, within a\r\nfew days, a malt-house of thirty feet square, and several other lesser\r\nbuildings which were found necessary. I have cleared, and in a good\r\nmeasure fitted for improvement, about seventy or eighty acres of land,\r\nand seeded with English grain about twenty acres, from which I have\r\ntaken at the late harvest, what was esteemed a good crop, considering\r\nthe land was so lately laid open to the sun. I have cut what is judged\r\nto be equal to fourteen or fifteen tons of good hay, which I stacked,\r\nby which the expense of supporting a team and cows the ensuing winter\r\nmay be considerably lessened. I have also about eighteen acres of\r\nIndian corn now on the ground, which promises a good crop. My laborers\r\nare preparing more lands for improvement; some to sow with English\r\ngrain this fall, and others for pasturing, which sad experience has\r\ntaught me the necessity of, as I have suffered much by being\r\ndisappointed of this benefit, through the negligence of a number, who\r\nsubscribed labor to encourage the settlement of the school in this\r\nplace, and, in excuse for their not being as punctual in performing as\r\nthey appeared liberal in subscribing, plead their poverty and the\r\nnecessities of their families in their new beginnings in this\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\n\"I hope through the blessing of God, even the ensuing year, we shall\r\nfind that near sufficient has been raised on these lands to supply the\r\nschool with bread, which will be a great relief not only as to the\r\nexpense, but as to care and fatigue in procuring it; as the greatest\r\nand cheapest part of the support of my family has been transported\r\nabove an hundred, and much of it near two hundred miles through new\r\nand bad roads; which has made the expense of some articles equal to\r\nthe first cost, and many of them much more. The cheapest fodder I had\r\nthe last winter to support my team and a few cows was brought forty\r\nmiles on sleds by oxen.\r\n\r\n\"It is not easy for one who is not acquainted with the affair of\r\nbuilding and settling in such a wilderness to conceive of the many\r\ndifficulties, fatigues, and extraordinary expenses attending it; nor\r\ndoes it make the burden at all less, if there are numbers settling\r\nwithin a few miles, who are poor and needy, and so far from having\r\nability to contribute their assistance to others, as to stand in\r\nconstant need of help themselves.\r\n\r\n\"The number of my students belonging to the college and school has\r\nbeen from forty to fifty, of which from five to nine have been\r\nIndians. The English youth on charity are all fitting for\r\nmissionaries, if God in his providence shall open a door for their\r\nserving him in that capacity, and they have been about twenty.\r\n\r\n\"My students have been universally well engaged in their studies, and\r\na number of independent as well as charity scholars, have only by\r\nturning a necessary diversion to agreeable manual labor, done much to\r\nlessen the expense of their education the last year.\"\r\n\r\nIn an appendix to this \"Narrative,\" dated September 26, 1772, after\r\nreferring to a prospect of obtaining sons of some of the Caghnawaga\r\nchiefs, President Wheelock says: \"One was a descendant from the Rev.\r\nMr. Williams, who was captivated from Deerfield in 1704. Another was a\r\ndescendant from Mr. Tarbell, who was captivated from Groton [in 1707],\r\nwho is now a hearty and active man, and the eldest chief, and chief\r\nspeaker of the tribe. The other was son to Mr. Stacey, who was\r\ncaptivated from Ipswich, and is a good interpreter for that tribe.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of all the facts within our knowledge, it seems more than\r\npossible that the influence of these and other captives, now venerable\r\nwith age, upon their red brethren, on the one hand, and dim but\r\nprecious memories of their own childhood, on the other, had aided\r\nmaterially in determining the location of the college. The patronage\r\nof the Canadian tribes was President Wheelock's main reliance for\r\nIndian students after his removal to Hanover.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the missionaries sent out by President Wheelock at this\r\nperiod, his biographer says: \"Some went into the Mohawk and Oneida\r\ncountry, others to the Indians upon the Muskingum, and several to the\r\ntribes within the bounds of Canada. They found the Indians, the\r\nOneidas excepted, universally opposed to them.\"[29]\r\n\r\n      [29] Memoirs of Wheelock, p. 63.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will be safe to make a slight abatement from the somewhat\r\nsweeping statement which closes this quotation.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Narrative\" for the period between September, 1772, and\r\nSeptember, 1773, President Wheelock says: \"My crops were considerably\r\nshortened the last year, by an uncommon rain at the beginning of\r\nharvest, and by an untimely frost, yet the benefit of that which is\r\nsaved is very sensible. I have this year cut about double the quantity\r\nof hay which I cut last year, namely, about thirty tons. I have reaped\r\nabout twenty acres of English grain, which crop appeared to be very\r\nheavy before harvest, and proved too much so, as a considerable part\r\nof it fell down of its own weight before maturity; however, though it\r\nbe much less than the prospect was, it is a very considerable relief.\r\nI have about twenty acres of Indian corn on the ground, which,\r\nconsidering the newness and imperfect tillage of the land, promises a\r\nconsiderable crop.\r\n\r\n\"I have cleared sufficient for pasturing, _i. e._ have cut and girdled\r\nall the growth upon five hundred acres, and a part of it have sowed\r\nwith hay-seed; the rest I expect will be ready to receive the seed as\r\nsoon as it shall be dry enough to burn the trash upon it in the\r\nspring. The soil is generally good, and I hope the school will\r\nexperience the benefit of it in due time. I have inclosed with a fence\r\nabout two thousand acres of this wilderness, that I might be able to\r\nrestrain oxen, cows, horses, etc., from rambling beyond my reach.\r\n\r\n\"I have seven yoke of oxen and about twenty cows, all the property and\r\nemployed in the service of the school. The number of my laborers for\r\nsix months past has generally been from thirty to forty, besides those\r\nemployed at the mills, in the kitchen, wash-house, etc. The number of\r\nmy students, dependent and independent, the last year was about\r\neighty. A little more than three years ago there was nothing to be\r\nseen here but a horrid wilderness; now there are eleven comfortable\r\ndwelling-houses (beside the large one I built for my students), built\r\nby tradesmen and such as have settled in some connection with, and\r\nhave been admitted for the benefit of, this school, and all within\r\nsixty rods of the college. By this means the necessities of this\r\nschool have been relieved in part as to room for my students. Yet the\r\npresent necessity of another and larger building appears to be such\r\nthat the growth of this seminary must necessarily be stinted without\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"When I think of the great weight of present expense for the support\r\nof sixteen or seventeen Indian boys, which has been my number all the\r\nlast year, and as many English youth on charity, eight in the\r\nwilderness who depend upon their support wholly from this quarter,\r\nwhich has been the case a considerable part of this year, such a\r\nnumber of laborers, and under necessity to build a house for myself\r\n(as the house I have lived in was planned for a store-house, and must\r\nbe used for that purpose) and expense for three and sometimes four\r\ntutors, which has been the least number that would suffice for well\r\ninstructing my students, I have sometimes found faintness of heart.\r\nBut I have always made it my practice not to exceed what my own\r\nprivate interest [property] will pay, in case I should be brought to\r\nthat necessity to do my creditors justice.\"\r\n\r\nIn his \"Narrative\" for the period between September, 1773, and\r\nFebruary, 1775, President Wheelock says: \"The number of Indians in\r\nthis school since my last 'Narrative,' has been from sixteen to\r\ntwenty-one, and the whole number of charity or dependent scholars\r\nabout thirty.\" The whole number of students was now about one hundred.\r\n\r\n\"The progress of husbandry on this farm, the last year, has not been\r\nequal in every respect to my hope, the season proving so wet as not to\r\nfavor some branches of it. However, the progress of it and the benefit\r\nby it, have been very considerable. I have raised and reaped upon the\r\nschool land, the last year, about three hundred bushels of choice\r\nwheat, but the crop of Indian corn fell much short of my expectations,\r\nbeing but about two hundred and fifty bushels. I have cut sixty tons\r\nof hay the last season, and have a prospect of a very considerable\r\naddition to that quantity the next, if Providence shall favor it.\r\n\r\n\"I have begun to prepare and have a prospect that I shall be able to\r\nfit about sixty acres of new land to sow with wheat the next season. I\r\nhave improved about twelve or fourteen oxen, and about twenty cows,\r\nthe property of the school, and have a prospect of plenty for their\r\nsupport for summer and winter, and I find already the great benefit of\r\nhaving wherewith to do it this winter without the fatigue and expense\r\nof going forty miles for it, as I have been forced to do till this\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\nHe also refers to important agricultural operations, and the erection\r\nof buildings at Landaff--Governor Wentworth's first choice as a\r\nlocation for the college--and preparations for a new college edifice.\r\n\r\nTo Messrs. Savage and Keen, he writes, October 24, 1775: \"The progress\r\nof the great design under my hand has been as rapid since resources\r\nfrom your side the water have been suspended as ever. Every day turns\r\nout some new wonder of Divine favor towards it. I have this day been\r\nout to see my laborers who have near finished sowing one hundred and\r\nten acres of wheat and rye, but mostly of wheat, one hundred acres of\r\nit on new land. No providences, however calamitous to others, not even\r\nour present public distresses, but seem as though they were calculated\r\nto favor this design. God gives me all I ask for, and He is a\r\nprayer-hearing God.\"\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the present librarian of the college[30] for the\r\nfollowing interesting facts relating to this period:\r\n\r\n      [30] Professor C. W. Scott.\r\n\r\n\"The library of Dartmouth College may be considered as older than the\r\ncollege itself, as it had its origin in the 'Indian Charity School,'\r\nand existed as a handful of books before the granting of the college\r\nCharter. These books are found principally among the theological\r\nworks, in folio volumes, with Latin texts or notes, and uninviting\r\ntype. Received as they were more than a hundred years ago, they were\r\nthen publications of the preceding century; and they would hardly find\r\ntheir way into the library to-day, if admitted upon the demand of\r\nreaders, yet in their bindings and worn leaves they show that by some\r\none they were thoroughly used. A copy of 'Lightfoot's Harmony of the\r\nNew Testament,' under date of June, 1764, has written across a leaf:\r\n'Received from the Rev. Dr. Gifford, of London, sundry second-hand\r\nbooks given by poor persons to the Indian Charity School in Lebanon,\r\nof which this is one.' Marks on other volumes show that Dr. Gifford\r\nwas a contributor as well as a collector. Edinburgh, too [through Dr.\r\nErskine], sent its offering of books, and as the struggling school\r\ncame to be better known in England, through the commissioners sent to\r\nsolicit aid, and through other sources, such gifts probably became not\r\ninfrequent. The early history and intentions of the college were such\r\nas to particularly interest clergymen, and in proportion to their\r\nmeans they were doubtless the most generous givers of books. Their\r\nnames written across fly-leaves show that many volumes, in different\r\nparts of New England, did service in their studies before finding a\r\nplace in the college library. One of the most noteworthy of such\r\nbenefactors was Rev. Diodate Johnson, of Millington, Conn., who,\r\nbesides other gifts, in 1773 bestowed his entire library.\"\r\n\r\nNearly at the same period with Mr. Johnson's donation, Hon. John\r\nPhillips, of Exeter, made a handsome donation, for a philosophical\r\napparatus. The subsequent appropriation of the money, for another\r\npurpose, compelled the college to dispense with this useful furniture\r\nfor a considerable period.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of the Revolutionary struggle soon proved a serious\r\nembarrassment to President Wheelock: \"The din of war drowned the\r\nfeeble voice of science; men turned away from this 'school of the\r\nprophets' to hear tidings from the camp.\" But the heroic founder stood\r\nmanfully at his post, faithfully performing his duty, with only brief\r\ninterruptions, until, in the midst of that great conflict which made\r\nus a nation, he was called to his reward. He died, after a lingering\r\nillness, at Hanover, on the 24th of April, 1779. His first wife, Mrs.\r\nSarah (Davenport) Maltby Wheelock, of the distinguished John Davenport\r\nfamily, died in Connecticut. His second wife, Mrs. Mary (Brinsmead)\r\nWheelock, was spared to minister to the last earthly wants of her\r\nrevered companion.\r\n\r\nPresident Wheelock lived to see his earnest efforts to promote sound\r\nlearning crowned with a good measure of success.\r\n\r\nThe graduates of this period attained such eminence, in nearly all\r\nthe paths of professional usefulness, as to indicate most plainly that\r\nthey had laid good foundations in college. They were honored as\r\nteachers, as divines, and as legislators. The condition of the college\r\nand the country gave them abundant opportunities for appreciating the\r\ninscription on the armor of the Dartmouth family: \"Gaudet tentamine\r\nvirtus.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of burning the \"midnight oil\" of the modern student, they kept\r\nthe midnight watch against savage foes, at least at certain periods.\r\nTo us, this all looks like romance. To them, it was stern reality.\r\n\r\nIn a fitting tribute to President Wheelock,[31] Rev. Dr. Allen says:\r\n\r\n      [31] Sprague's Annals of the American Pulpit.\r\n\r\n\"If it should be asked what success attended the efforts of Dr.\r\nWheelock to communicate the gospel to the Indian nations, it may be\r\nreplied that he accomplished something for their benefit, and that\r\ngreat and insuperable obstacles in the providence of God prevented him\r\nfrom accomplishing more. It was soon after he sent out missionaries\r\ninto the wilderness, that the controversy with Great Britain blighted\r\nhis fair and encouraging prospects. During the last four years of his\r\nlife there was actual war, in which many of the Indian tribes acted\r\nwith the enemy. Yet the Oneidas, to whom Mr. Kirkland was sent as a\r\nmissionary, kept the hatchet buried during the whole Revolutionary\r\nstruggle, and by means of this mission, probably, were a multitude of\r\nfrontier settlements saved from the tomahawk and the scalping-knife.\r\nBut even if nothing had been accomplished for the benefit of the\r\nIndians, yet the zeal which chiefly sought their good, reared up a\r\nvenerable institution of science, in which many strong minds have been\r\ndisciplined and made to grow stronger, and nerved for professional\r\ntoils and public labors, and in which hundreds of ministers have been\r\nnurtured for the church of Christ.\r\n\r\n\"For enlarged views and indomitable energy, and persevering and most\r\narduous toils, and for the great results of his labors in the cause of\r\nreligion and learning, Dr. Wheelock must ever be held in high honor.\r\nHe early placed one great object before him, and that object held\r\nhis undivided attention for nearly half a century. It is not\r\neasy to describe the variety of his cares and the extent of his\r\ntoils. When he removed to Hanover his labors were doubled. The two\r\ninstitutions--the school and the college--were ever kept distinct; in\r\nboth he was a teacher; of both he was the chief governor. He was also\r\nthe preacher of the college and village. In the government of his\r\nschool and college, Dr. Wheelock combined great patience and kindness\r\nwith the energy of proper and indispensable discipline. He was of a\r\ncheerful and pleasant temper and manifested much urbanity in his\r\ndeportment.\"\r\n\r\nThis clear and forcible language has additional weight when we\r\nconsider, that, during nearly the whole period of his administration,\r\nhe had only the aid of tutors, with no other professor.\r\n\r\nPresident Wheelock's usefulness in the great field of education was\r\nnot confined to the sons of the forest, during his residence in\r\nConnecticut. He sought out John Smalley, the son of one of his\r\nparishioners, in his humble home, prepared him for college, and\r\nthereby gave him the primary impulse and aid, without which one of New\r\nEngland's ablest theologians, and the teacher of others of widely\r\nextended influence, might have remained in life-long retirement. He\r\ntook Samuel Kirkland, the son of a worthy but indigent brother in the\r\nministry, and, to use his own language, \"carried him\" in his arms,\r\ntill he had completed a thorough preparation for the ministry, and\r\nfinally furnished him a wife from his own kindred and his own\r\nhousehold. His distinguished beneficiary, beside all his other labors,\r\nlaid the foundation of Hamilton College, and gave to Harvard the\r\npresident of its \"Augustan age,\" his son, John Thornton Kirkland. He\r\nleft the impress of his intellectual and religious character upon his\r\npupil, Benjamin Trumbull, the records of whose life give him a\r\nconspicuous place among the earnest preachers and careful historians\r\nof his day. The valuable influence of others of his early pupils will\r\nbe felt in ever extending circles, down to \"the last syllable of\r\nrecorded time.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no need that Eleazar Wheelock should found a college at that\r\nadvanced period of life when men naturally seek a measure of repose,\r\nin order to secure for his name an honorable position in the long and\r\nbrilliant catalogue of American educators. The crowning act of his\r\nlife, in the mellowed maturity of age, was scarcely more or less than\r\nthe logical, inevitable result of what preceded it.\r\n\r\nThe scope of our work does not permit any extended eulogy of President\r\nWheelock, nor any thorough analysis of his character. With a brief\r\nreference to some leading points, we must close the record.\r\n\r\nHe was eminent as a scholar. The constantly recurring and ever\r\npressing duties of earnest and varied professional life, left him\r\nlittle leisure for indulging in the luxuries of mere æsthetic culture;\r\nbut his active mind ranged widely through the realms of ancient and\r\nmodern thought, and freely appropriated of the richest of their\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\nHe was eminent as an orator. His eloquence was not graced with the\r\nwell-rounded periods of a Burke, or a Webster; but in many a village\r\nand hamlet, the burning words which fell from his lips stirred the\r\nhearts of men to their profoundest depths.\r\n\r\nHe was eminent as a teacher. Through life he gladly embraced every\r\nopportunity of opening the treasuries of knowledge to his fellow-men;\r\nand many who sat under his instruction were thereby laid under large\r\nobligations, although, in the rude halls of the infant college, he was\r\nalways more or less embarrassed by the cares of business and the\r\ninfirmities of advancing years.\r\n\r\nHe was eminent in affairs. He raised funds; procured corporate\r\nfranchises and safeguards; leveled forests, and reared edifices in the\r\nface of apathy, opposition, and rivalry, with a fertility of resources\r\nin planning, and an energy in executing, which won the admiration of\r\ncontemporaries in both hemispheres.\r\n\r\nHe was eminent as a patriot. When his faithful friend, the last Royal\r\nGovernor of New Hampshire, upon whom through years of toil and trial\r\nhe had leaned as upon a strong staff, abandoned his office, and\r\nresolutely adhered to his Sovereign, and many others to whom he was\r\nstrongly attached, arrayed themselves on the same side, he as\r\nresolutely espoused the cause of American Independence, and labored to\r\nthe extent of his ability for its accomplishment.\r\n\r\nBut neither the scholar, nor the orator, nor the teacher, nor the man\r\nof affairs, nor the patriot, nor all combined, would have secured to\r\nany man that conspicuous position upon the page of history which the\r\nleading founder of Dartmouth College will occupy, so long as solid\r\nworth and successful achievement shall command the attention of the\r\ndiscriminating, thoughtful reader.\r\n\r\nReligion was the mainspring of his entire life, the real source of all\r\nhis success. Without it, he might have been honored of men; with it,\r\nhe was honored of God. Encircling all the separate parts of his\r\ncharacter, like a golden chain, it bound them in one grand, beautiful,\r\nharmonious whole.\r\n\r\nIn the hallowed seclusion of that thrice-honored valley, where\r\nJonathan Edwards was born and Thomas Hooker died,--on the western\r\nverge of that modest plain, where his long and fruitful life bore its\r\nlatest, richest fruit,--his precious dust will slumber \"till the\r\nheavens be no more,\" and not till then will the Christian scholar, who\r\nlingers among the hills of central New England, cease to pay his\r\ndevotions at the grave of\r\n\r\nEleazar Wheelock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS DURING THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECOND PRESIDENT, JOHN\r\nWHEELOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first President of the College, availing himself of a provision in\r\nthe Charter, named three persons in his will, some one of whom he\r\ndesired should be his successor in the office. These were his son, Mr.\r\nJohn Wheelock, Rev. Joseph Huntington, of Coventry, Conn., and Prof.\r\nSylvanus Ripley. Mr. Wheelock, although a young man, in response to\r\nthe somewhat earnest solicitation of the Trustees, after mature\r\ndeliberation decided to accept the position. His son-in-law, Rev. Dr.\r\nAllen, gives the leading points in his earlier life in the following\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n\"He was born [a son by the father's second marriage] at Lebanon,\r\nConn., January 28, 1754, and graduated in Dartmouth's first class, in\r\n1771. In 1772, he was appointed a tutor, and was devoted to the\r\nbusiness of instruction until the beginning of the Revolution. In\r\n1775, he was a member of the [N. H.] Assembly. In the spring of 1777,\r\nhe was appointed a Major in the service of New York, and in November,\r\na Lieutenant-colonel in the Continental army under Colonel Bedel. In\r\n1778 he marched a detachment from Coos to Albany. By direction of\r\nStark he conducted an expedition into the Indian country. At the\r\nrequest of General Gates, he entered his family, and continued with\r\nhim, until he was recalled to Hanover by the death of his father, in\r\n1779.\"\r\n\r\nThe following pages, extracted from the \"Sketches of the History of\r\nDartmouth College and Moor's Charity School,\" prepared and published\r\nunder President Wheelock's sanction, are deemed worthy of insertion in\r\nthis connection.\r\n\r\n\"The founder and first president spent nine years in planting\r\nand raising up a new society, in converting forests into\r\nfields,--supporting many youths on charity. Persevering through\r\ndifficulties, without any stipend for his labors, the seminary grew in\r\nvital strength;--but destitute of patronage in America, its resources\r\nin Europe mostly expended, and the residue wholly obstructed, beset\r\nwith calamities by the troubles and disasters of the Revolutionary\r\nWar, it was reduced, in childhood, to nakedness and want, in the year\r\n1779. Soon after the treasurer, making an estimate of the demands upon\r\nit, pronounced that all the property of the corporation, if sold at\r\nvendue, would not be sufficient to cancel its debts. Under these\r\nclouds, the successor of the founder came into office, with a humble\r\nsense of his duty, and a belief that God, who had protected and\r\nsustained the seminary in floods of trouble, would relieve and build\r\nit up. He solicited benefactions abroad for support of the charity\r\nyouths of the school in 1780, 1781, and 1782.\r\n\r\n\"In the latter part of that year Dr. Wheelock, the president, set off\r\nfor Europe. The Institution and his design were known, and sanctioned\r\nby very ample recommendations, unnecessary to be inserted here,\r\nissuing from the highest sources in America--from the President and a\r\ngreat majority of the members of Congress, in their official\r\ncharacters;--it ought to be recorded--from the Father of his Country,\r\nGeorge Washington, who well knew Dr. Wheelock, while an officer in the\r\nRevolutionary War, and honored him with his particular notice and\r\nfriendship; from many of the most celebrated generals of the army, and\r\nGovernors of the different states, with introductory letters from the\r\nChevalier de Luzerne, minister plenipotentiary from the court of\r\nVersailles, to Count de Vergennes, prime minister of France, from the\r\nSecretary of the United States, and other eminent characters to\r\ndifferent parts of Europe.\r\n\r\n\"After some weeks spent in France, Dr. Wheelock, receiving\r\nintroductory and friendly letters to Mr. Dumas, the American _Chargé\r\nd'Affaires_, and others in Holland, from Dr. Franklin, and John Adams,\r\nproceeded to the Netherlands. A considerable sum was obtained in the\r\nNetherlands; but we omit a particular account of the respectful\r\ntreatment and generous benefactions he received from the Prince of\r\nOrange and others high in office.\r\n\r\n\"Thence he embarked for Great Britain, partly with a view, much\r\nlessened by the public feelings from the Revolution in America, to\r\nobtain some new aids; but chiefly to reclaim and negotiate for the\r\nfund in Scotland, belonging to the school. It had been barred from\r\nbefore the death of his predecessor, whose bills were protested, and\r\nstill lay with their charges unredeemed, besides large accounts for\r\nthe support of Indian youths, without the means of payment, unless by\r\nexhausting the residue of the property of the college. He traveled\r\nfrom Poole to London, where he paid his first and grateful respects to\r\nthe Earl of Dartmouth, Mr. John Thornton and others, who, being\r\nformerly of the Board of Trust, had been in friendly relations with\r\nthe founder, and patronized and cherished the seminary, in the\r\njeopardies of its infancy. With his eyes invariably on the object, by\r\nan introductory letter from Dr. Macclion, to Ralph Griffith, Esq., LL.\r\nD., he obtained friendly access to Mr. Straghn, member of parliament\r\nand the king's printer, and became acquainted with his son-in-law, Mr.\r\nSpotswood. This respected gentleman, largely connected, and concerned\r\nin the agencies of Scotland, took a benevolent and decisive part in\r\nconsulting, and adopting measures to restore the fund, at Edinburgh,\r\nin the care of the Society, to its primitive channel. Communications\r\nwere opened--the bills were paid; and the way prepared for future\r\nnegotiations, till the Society were convinced of the justice of the\r\nclaim. The money has since been applied to the support of the school\r\nin its original design; and arrearages of interest remitted to the\r\npresident to cancel the debts overwhelming the seminary. He, also,\r\nwhile in England, as on the continent, procured some coins and\r\narticles appreciated by the _virtuosi_. By the benevolence of Paul\r\nWentworth, Esq., Doctor Rose, and other friends to the college, some\r\nvaluable philosophical instruments were obtained, and others promised,\r\nthe making of which the two former kindly engaged to superintend, and\r\nforward the whole, so soon as completed, to America. A way, besides,\r\nwas preparing to provide natural curiosities for a museum. Those\r\ninstruments, with their additions, well constructed, forming an\r\napparatus sufficient for all the more important experiments and\r\nobservations in Natural Philosophy, afterwards arrived; and at the\r\nsame time a curious and valuable collection of stones and fossils from\r\nIndia, and different parts of Europe, for the museums from the\r\nbeneficent Mr. Forsythe, keeper of the king's gardens, at Kensington.\r\nAll these with costs of transportation, were gifts received at the\r\ncollege, by the Trustees. Only a word more; a large and elegant gold\r\nmedal was presented by Mr. Clyde of London, to Dr. Wheelock, in his\r\nofficial character. It is wholly irrelevant to our purpose, and\r\nneedless to speak of the personal civilities and friendly notices of\r\nLord Rawden, by whose goodness he was introduced at the House of\r\nLords, of Sir John Wentworth, Sir J. Blois, Dr. Price, and others,\r\nbesides those before mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"Within three months after the President's return (in 1784) the Board\r\nof Trustees convened and resolved, if sufficient means could be\r\nobtained, to erect an edifice of about one hundred and fifty by fifty\r\nfeet, three stories in height, for the college, with convenient\r\naccommodations for the members. The president, professors, and some of\r\nthe Trustees in the vicinity, were requested by the Board to solicit\r\nsubscriptions for the purpose. They depended on Dr. Wheelock's\r\nexertions, he cheerfully undertook. By his arrangement and exertions,\r\nin that and the following year 1785, and by his agents, near fifteen\r\nthousand dollars were given but mostly subscribed to be paid, and\r\nchiefly by responsible men in different places. The subscriptions and\r\npayments were all put into the hands of the contractor. He commenced\r\nand carried on the building. But in 1786 he was unable to procure\r\nsupplies and nothing but an immediate cessation of the business\r\nappeared. Dr. Wheelock afforded relief, by furnishing the joiners,\r\nabout twenty in number, with sustenance through the season, and aiding\r\nin the collection of materials. In the succeeding years, the\r\nsubscriptions and means in the hands of the contractor being\r\nexhausted, he procured by bills on Mrs. Wheelock's agent in the West\r\nIndies, and by a residue remitted from Holland and in other ways by\r\nhis friends abroad, and his own donation of $333.00, all the glass,\r\nthe nails, the vane and spire and other articles and some pay towards\r\nthe labor. A bell he had by solicitation obtained before. By the\r\nseventh year from the beginning of its foundation, the edifice\r\n[Dartmouth Hall] was finished, and well prepared for the reception of\r\nthe students. We will now return to trace another chain of operation.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Wheelock, though not at the particular request of the Board,\r\nattended the Legislature of Vermont, June 14, 1785. He solicited; and\r\nthey made a grant of a township [Wheelock], 23,040 acres, one half to\r\nthe college and the other half to the school, to be free from all\r\npublic taxes forever. As soon as practical he procured a survey,\r\nobtained a charter, and made calculations for its settlement. Families\r\nrapidly moved in, till near the number of one hundred. He disposed of\r\na large part of the tract in small portions on long leases. A few\r\nyears rent free, the annual product has been to the college and\r\nschool, each, six hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n\"We now turn to the State of New Hampshire. Dr. Wheelock had applied,\r\nby the desire of the Board, to the General Court for a lottery, and\r\nobtained it; but from unexpected events not answering the purpose,\r\nthey requested him in 1787 to present a memorial to the Legislature\r\nfor another lottery under different modifications. Professor Woodward\r\nattended as agent--the design was effected, and the avails received by\r\nthe Board.\r\n\r\n\"The pressure of demands on the college induced him to apply and\r\nattend the Legislature, in the month of January, 1739, for the charter\r\nof a tract of land on Connecticut river and near the northern confine\r\nof the State. A committee was appointed; occasional discussions arose\r\nfor several days; the matter was finally brought before the House. The\r\nSenate and House of Representatives passed an act granting to the\r\nTrustees of Dartmouth College a valuable tract of eight miles square,\r\nabout 42,000 acres adjoining north of Stewarts town. [Ebenezer Webster\r\nwas the chairman of the Legislative committee recommending this\r\ngrant.] The forcible and energetic eloquence of General Sullivan, that\r\neminent commander in the Revolutionary War, in the debate on this\r\nsubject cannot be forgotten. It drew him from his bed, amidst the\r\nfirst attacks of fatal disease--and it was the last speech which he\r\never made in public. This interesting grant scattered the clouds just\r\nbursting on the institution. It was now harrassed with heavy debts of\r\nan early standing in its losses at Landaff, which amounted to $30,000.\r\n\r\n\"At the time of obtaining the above grant, Dr. Wheelock also\r\nnegotiated to recover the donation of $583, made by Dr. John Phillips,\r\nin 1772 [for a philosophical apparatus], to the college, and deposited\r\nin the hands of Governor Wentworth, which, after he left the country\r\nwas considered, from his circumstances, as wholly lost. But Dr.\r\nWheelock adopted measures and secured an account of the same and\r\ninterest out of confiscated property $1,203, in notes and\r\ncertificates, which he received of the Treasurer of the State, for the\r\nTrustees. He also received, about that period, $125, committed to his\r\nagency by the same great benefactor, in a particular conference to\r\ntransact with the Board, said sum to be given in his name to them;\r\nonly on the express condition, that they would agree to sequester with\r\nit his gift of about 4,000 acres of land by deed to them in 1781, as\r\nan accumulating fund for the express purpose of supporting a professor\r\nof Theology. They accepted the gift and sequestered the property on\r\nthe terms of the donor.\r\n\r\n\"The president had taken into his own hands, at the desire of the\r\nBoard, the management of the finances and external interest of the\r\ncollege, and continued to conduct, and regulate them, for five years,\r\nthrough its difficult and trying scenes. Having, besides what has been\r\nmentioned, among other arrangements, leased a number of lots\r\npermanently productive, secured the appropriation of several valuable\r\ntracts, in the vicinity of the college, to the use of professorships,\r\nand provided relief by obtaining the means to free the seminary from\r\nits weight of debts, he resigned to the Board, in August following,\r\nthe particular charge of the finances, except retaining in trust the\r\ndisposal of the college moiety of the township in Vermont till a few\r\nyears after, when he had completed the proposed object of settling and\r\nleasing the same.\r\n\r\n\"The next year, 1790, there being no proper place for the public\r\nreligious and literary exercises of the members of the seminary, the\r\napartment of the old building falling into decay and ruin, he\r\nundertook, made arrangements, provided the means, and erected by\r\ncontract, in five months, a chapel, near the new college edifice. It\r\nis fifty feet by thirty-six, of two stories height, arched within and\r\ncompletely finished, and painted without--convenient, and well adapted\r\nto the objects proposed.\r\n\r\n\"He caused a new building [for Moor's School] to be erected and\r\nfinished, with a yard, in 1791--two stories high, the lower apartment\r\nconvenient to accommodate near a hundred youths. The school was\r\nimproved in the order and regulation of its members under the\r\ndistinguished talents and fidelity of their instructor Mr. [Josiah]\r\nDunham, the present Secretary of Vermont. At the request of the\r\nSociety three years after it was visited by a committee of their\r\nBoston commissioners charged with the solution of a number of queries\r\nin regard to its state, relations, and property. Their favorable\r\nreport was transmitted to Scotland.\r\n\r\n\"Of the large debts accumulated for the support of the school, in the\r\nlatter years of the first president, to discharge the most pressing\r\npart, the Trustees had consented to the disposal of lands and property\r\nin their hands, hoping that the amount would be replaced. The\r\nadvances, thus made, the president considered himself as holden in\r\njustice to refund; and accordingly paid them for the college, in the\r\nyear 1793, $4,000, besides some items of small amount before. [Lands\r\nalso appear to have been sold to aid in building Dartmouth Hall.]\r\n\r\n\"The Rev. Israel Evans [of Concord] at that time was a member of the\r\nBoard. He had expressed more than once, in intimate conversation to\r\nDr. Wheelock, their friendship having been long cemented in scenes of\r\nwar and peace, his desire to do something for the good of mankind and\r\nthe institution. He finally remarked, that he had made up his mind to\r\nsequester a portion of his property as the foundation for a\r\nprofessorship of eloquence; which he knew would also be agreeable to\r\nMrs. Evans. Confined by sickness the succeeding year, at his earnest\r\nrequest, by a special message, the Doctor paid him a visit. The latter\r\nexpressed in his family, his views and design; and receiving from the\r\nformer an assent to his wishes to insert his name as one of the\r\nexecutors, proceeded in the full exercise of his mental faculties, to\r\ncomplete his will. Besides his bequests otherwise, he gave of money in\r\nthe funds, and real estate, the amount of about $7,000, or upwards, in\r\nreversion to the Trustees of Dartmouth College, after the death of his\r\nwife, as a permanent fund for a professor of eloquence.\r\n\r\n\"About the same time, Dr. Wheelock attended the General Court, to open\r\nthe way for their favorable attention to the important objects of the\r\ninstitution. Matters were in suspense till the next session in June\r\n1807, when he again personally appeared before the Legislature. His\r\nmemorial was considered, committed, and after report an act was made,\r\ngranting to the Trustees of the college a township of the contents of\r\nsix miles square, to be laid out on the border of the District of\r\nMaine, to the approbation of the Governor and Council. The land was\r\nsurveyed: mostly an excellent tract, watered by a branch of the river\r\nAndroscoggin running central through the whole, and near the northern\r\nturnpike road--he waited on them with the plan, and obtained their\r\nratification in 1808.\"\r\n\r\nThe grant of Landaff to the college had great weight with President\r\nWheelock, in deciding upon a location. But after he had expended\r\nseveral thousand dollars in improvements there, the title was found to\r\nbe defective, and prior grantees secured the whole. In view of this\r\nloss, the State with commendable liberality made the above grants.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been no material change in the policy of the\r\ncollege, or the course of study, in the earlier years of this\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe following items from the official records of the Trustees are\r\nworthy of notice, the first bearing date, August, 1794:\r\n\r\n\"Voted that those Freshmen who wish to be excused from going errands\r\nfor other students be not obliged to go, and that those who do not go\r\nsuch errands have not afterwards the privilege of sending Freshmen.\r\n\r\n\"Adjourned Meeting, February, 1796. No person shall be admitted into\r\nthe Freshman class unless he be versed in Virgil, Cicero's Select\r\nOrations, the Greek Testament, be able accurately to translate English\r\ninto Latin, and also understands the fundamental rules of\r\nArithmetic.\"[32]\r\n\r\n      [32] Memoirs of Wheelock.\r\n\r\nThe following statement was published in 1811:\r\n\r\n\"The immediate instruction and government of the students is with the\r\npresident, who is also professor of civil and Ecclesiastical History,\r\na professor of the Latin, Greek, Hebrew and Oriental Languages, a\r\nprofessor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, a professor of\r\nDivinity, and two tutors. The qualifications for admission into the\r\nFreshman class are, a good moral character, a good acquaintance with\r\nVirgil, Cicero's Select Orations, the Greek Testament, knowledge to\r\ntranslate English into Latin, and an acquaintance with the fundamental\r\nrules of Arithmetic. The members of the classes, in rotation, declaim\r\nbefore the officers in the chapel every Wednesday, at two o'clock, P.\r\nM.\r\n\r\n\"The Senior, Junior, and Sophomore classes, successively pronounce\r\nsuch orations and other compositions, written by themselves, as the\r\npresident and professors shall direct, on the last Wednesday of\r\nNovember, the second Wednesday of March, and the third Wednesday of\r\nMay. Tragedies, plays, and all irreligious expressions and sentiments\r\nare sacredly prohibited.\r\n\r\n\"The Languages, the Arts, and Sciences are studied in the following\r\norder: the Freshman Class study the Latin and Greek classics,\r\nArithmetic, English Grammar and Rhetoric. The Sophomore Class study\r\nthe Latin and Greek classics, Logic, Geography, Arithmetic, Geometry,\r\nTrigonometry, Algebra, Conic Sections, Surveying, Belles-lettres and\r\nCriticism. The Junior Class study the Latin and Greek classics,\r\nGeometry, Natural and Moral Philosophy, and Astronomy. The Senior\r\nClass read Metaphysics, Theology, and Natural and Political Law.\"\r\nChemistry was introduced at about this period. \"The study of the\r\nHebrew and the other Oriental Languages, as also the French Language,\r\nis recommended to the students. Every week some part of the classes\r\nexhibits composition according to the direction of the authority. All\r\nthe classes are publicly examined at stated periods; those who are\r\nfound deficient lose their standing in the class. It is a fixed rule\r\nthat the idle and vicious shall not receive the honors of college.\r\n\r\n\"The punishments inflicted on offenders are admonition, suspension and\r\nexpulsion. The president attends morning and evening prayers with the\r\nstudents in the chapel, and often delivers lectures to them on\r\necclesiastical history, on the doctrines of the Christian religion, or\r\nother important subjects. He hears the recitations of the Senior\r\nclass; his fund of general science renders this an interesting part of\r\ncollegiate life.\"\r\n\r\nThe librarian continues his statements as follows:\r\n\r\n\"While the library of the college was slowly increasing in numbers and\r\nmore slowly in value as measured by the wants of the students, there\r\nwere begun two other libraries, designed in the beginning as\r\nsupplements, but by their rapid increase and utility soon taking the\r\nleading place. In 1783, was formed the society of under-graduates\r\nknown under the title of 'Social Friends' and the collection of a\r\nlibrary was begun. Three years later, by the secession of a part of\r\nthe members, the rival society of the 'United Fraternity' came into\r\nexistence. The aim of the societies was to furnish literary culture,\r\nand their exercises and constitutions differed but little, while each\r\nattempted to obtain more and better men, and collect a larger library,\r\nthan the other. It was provided in the constitution of the last formed\r\nsociety, that each member should advance for the use of the library\r\ntwelve shillings lawful money.\r\n\r\n\"At a meeting during the next year the society voted to register its\r\nbooks, which consisted of twenty-three volumes of magazines and\r\nthirty-four other books, making with a few presented at the meeting a\r\nlibrary of sixty-three volumes. In 1790, the two societies subscribed\r\nto what they termed 'articles of confederation,' in which it was\r\nagreed that a case should be procured to contain their books, and that\r\neach society should aid in the increase of the common library. For\r\nthis purpose each society was to advance from one to two dollars for\r\nevery member, the sum being largest for the lowest class and least for\r\nthe Senior class, and a committee was constituted with power to\r\nsettle all differences. But however strong the agreement between the\r\ntwo parties it could not eliminate jealousy; neither were the\r\nsocieties entirely free from internal dissensions. The records contain\r\naccounts of 'conspiracies,' and attempts to destroy the societies,\r\naccompanied by reports of committees, treating the subject with the\r\ndignity of a danger to the State. One of these 'conspiracies' in 1793,\r\nterminated in the destruction of nearly all the records of the 'Social\r\nFriends' and almost caused the dissolution of the society. Much of the\r\nstrife between the societies was caused by the mode of securing\r\nmembers, and though there were amendments intended to lessen this,\r\nnothing like a settlement was made until 1815, when an order from the\r\nofficers of the college limited the membership of each society to one\r\nhalf of the number in the different classes. It was probably this\r\nquestion of membership that caused, in 1799, the division of the\r\n'federal library'; the 'United Fraternity' that year demanding a\r\nseparation, and the 'Social Friends' replying that they cheerfully\r\nconcurred. With the strong rivalry existing, the libraries could but\r\nincrease more rapidly under separate management, especially as the\r\nstudents for many years taxed themselves severely, and contributed\r\ngenerously by subscriptions and donations to fill up their few\r\nshelves. Nearly all the books were contributed by under-graduates, and\r\nthe value placed upon them forms a marked contrast with the present\r\nuse of library books. It was upon these libraries that the students\r\nmore generally depended, and while their additions were larger they\r\nalso had larger losses and suffered more from the wear of usage. They\r\nobtained from time to time the books that were needed, the college\r\nlibrary such as were given, and that was doubtless true during all of\r\nthe time which was said of it fifty years later: 'The library contains\r\nsome rare and valuable works, but is deficient in new books.' The\r\nsociety libraries from the beginning had regular and frequent hours\r\nfor drawing books, while the college library during a great part of\r\nits history has been from various reasons hardly accessible, or open\r\nonly at long intervals. In 1793, the college began the yearly\r\nassessment of eight shillings on each student, one fourth for the\r\nsalary of the librarian, and the remainder for the purchase of new\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\n\"The first printed catalogue of any of the libraries was of that of\r\nthe college, and was merely a list printed in 1810. It mentioned 2,900\r\nvolumes, but as there were many duplicates the number of books of any\r\npractical value was less than 2,000. The number of books in each of\r\nthe society libraries at this time may be estimated as slightly over\r\n1,000, so that the number of volumes to which access could be had was\r\nnot much over 4,000.\" We quote an item worthy of notice from official\r\nrecords on this subject:\r\n\r\n\"Annual Meeting of Trustees, September, A. D. 1783. This Board being\r\ninformed that Mr. Daniel Oliver, a student in the Junior class at this\r\nCollege, has made a donation to Library of the following books [43\r\nvolumes; 33 different works], Voted, that the Vice-president be\r\nrequested to return him the thanks of this Board and request his\r\nacceptance of the use of the college library free of charge during the\r\nterm he shall continue a student at this college.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nLACK OF HARMONY BETWEEN PRESIDENT WHEELOCK AND OTHER\r\nTRUSTEES.--REMOVAL OF THE PRESIDENT FROM OFFICE.--ESTIMATE OF HIS\r\nCHARACTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe administration of President John Wheelock is remarkable for two\r\nthings; its great length, and its unhappy close.\r\n\r\nThe great \"Dartmouth Controversy\" is one of the most impressive\r\nchapters in the annals of American colleges.\r\n\r\nIn discussing this subject it is necessary to consider some of the\r\ninfluences which had aided in moulding President Wheelock's character.\r\nHis residence at Yale College was at an important period in the\r\nhistory of that institution, commencing soon after the resignation of\r\nPresident Clap, who had been driven from his position, virtually, for\r\nopposing any interference in the affairs of the college, by the\r\nLegislature. The friends of education were divided in sentiment, as to\r\nthe wisdom of his course, and the institution was in some sense under\r\na cloud till the accession of President Stiles--a friend of the\r\nWheelock family--who effected an arrangement by which the State was\r\nadmitted to a share in the management of the college. The following\r\nletter from a prominent Trustee of Dartmouth to the president, written\r\njust at this period, shows that the animated contest in Connecticut\r\nwas only the natural and logical precursor of one more animated and\r\nmuch more important, in New Hampshire.\r\n\r\n    \"Charlestown, November 17, 1791.\r\n\r\n\"Hon. Sir: I have set my name to the petition, etc., although, I\r\nconfess not without some hesitation and reluctance. I like the plan\r\nwell in general,--but there is one exception. I cannot form any idea\r\nof what is intended by the proposal, That the Council, or Senate, or\r\nboth, be admitted to some cern in the government of the university\r\n[college].\r\n\r\n\"This appears to me to be a proposal of too much or nothing at all,\r\nand of something not in the power of this Board to confer, who I think\r\ncannot admit any foreign jurisdiction, any man, or number of men to\r\nany share in government of the university, properly so termed,\r\notherwise than what the Constitution specifies.\r\n\r\n\"I have, however, subscribed under the influence of this\r\nconsideration: That in the event it may subject us to no other\r\ninconvenience, but the imputation of inconsistence in conduct in\r\nhereafter rejecting a compliance with our own proposal, if we shall\r\nfind that more is performed by others than was intended, or can be\r\nadmitted by us, though fairly enough proffered.\r\n\r\n\"I think some precautionary injunctions to the Agent in this matter\r\nwould be wise and prudent.\r\n\r\n\"In haste--\r\n\r\n\"I am, sir, with much esteem and sincere affection,\r\n\r\n    \"Your sincere friend and humble servant,\r\n    \"Bulkley Olcott.\"\r\n    \"President Wheelock.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Wheelock's experiences also as a legislator and military\r\ncommander, in early life, doubtless gave him a larger confidence in\r\nhis own abilities on the one hand, and on the other a more profound\r\nconviction that everything in the State should, be subordinate to the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe religious aspects of President Wheelock's character, are worthy of\r\nspecial notice. He was the dutiful, in some sense the favorite son of\r\nan honored father. The former president, although sound in the faith,\r\nhad more catholic views and broader sympathies than many of the\r\nleading divines of his day. The son was no less liberal than the\r\nfather. This liberality was doubtless the real cause of difference\r\nbetween the second president and his associates in office. His first\r\ndecided opponent was Nathaniel Niles, who entered the Board in 1793, a\r\nman of rare ability, and in early life a pupil of Dr. Bellamy, whose\r\nreligious views on some points were materially different from those of\r\nhis contemporary and neighbor, the first president.\r\n\r\nThe first important point gained by Mr. Niles was the election of his\r\nfriend, Mr. Shurtleff, to the chair of Divinity, in 1804.\r\n\r\nFor ten years the breach was constantly widening between the president\r\nand his opponents. We now find the following official records:\r\n\r\n\"At a meeting of the Trustees, November 11, 1814, the following\r\npreamble and resolutions, introduced by Charles Marsh, Esq., were\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, the duties of the president of this university have become\r\nvery multiplied and arduous; and, whereas, it is necessary that he\r\nshould continue to attend to the concerns of this institution, and the\r\nvarious officers and departments thereof, and should have time to\r\nprepare and lay before this Board the business to which its attention\r\nshould be directed; therefore, resolved, that, in order to relieve the\r\npresident from some portion of the burdens which unavoidably devolve\r\non him, he be excused in future from hearing the recitations of the\r\nSenior Class, in Locke, Edwards, and Stewart.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, that the Professors, Shurtleff and Moore, jointly supply\r\nthe pulpit, in such manner as may be agreed between them. That\r\nProfessor Shurtleff hear the recitation of the Senior class in Edwards\r\non the Will; that Professor Adams hear the recitation of the Senior\r\nclass in Locke on the Human Understanding, and that Professor Moore\r\nhear the recitation of the Senior class in Stewart's Philosophy of the\r\nMind, and that he hear them in both volumes of that work.\"\r\n\r\nThis action of the Board was followed by the publication of the\r\n\"Sketches,\" and, in June, 1815, the presentation of the following\r\nPetition to the New Hampshire Legislature:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Honorable Legislators,--The citizens of New Hampshire enjoy security\r\nand peace under your wise laws; prosperity in productive labors by\r\nmeans which you have adopted; and, by your counsels, increasing\r\nknowledge in the establishment of literature through the State. But,\r\nfor none of these, can so much be ascribed to your attention as for\r\nDartmouth College. By your patronage and munificence it was\r\nflourishing in former years; and so it still would have continued had\r\nthe management of its concerns been adapted to answer the designs of\r\nyour wisdom, and the hopes of its most enlightened and virtuous\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\"To your Honorable body, whose guardian care encircles the\r\ninstitutions of the State, it becomes incumbent on the citizens to\r\nmake known any change in their condition and relations interesting to\r\nthe public good. To you alone, whose power extends to correcting or\r\nreforming their abuses, ought he to apply when they cease to promote\r\nthe end of their establishment, the social order and happiness.\r\n\r\n\"Gladly would the offerer of this humble address, avoiding to trouble\r\nyour counsels, have locked up his voice in perpetual silence, while\r\nthe evils are rolling on and accumulating, were he not otherwise\r\ncompelled by a sense of duty to your Legislature, and to the best\r\ninterests of mankind, in the present and future times.\r\n\r\n\"Will you permit him to suggest there is reason to fear that those who\r\nhold in trust the concerns of this seminary have forsaken its original\r\nprinciples and left the path of their predecessors. It is unnecessary\r\nto relate how the evil commenced in its embryo state; by what means\r\nand practices, they, thus deviating, have in recent years, with the\r\nsame object in view, increased their number to a majority controlling\r\nthe measures of the Board; but more important is it to lay before you\r\nthat there are serious grounds to excite apprehensions of the great\r\nimpropriety and dangerous tendency of their proceedings; reasons to\r\nbelieve that they have applied property to purposes wholly alien from\r\nthe intentions of the donors, and under peculiar circumstances to\r\nexcite regret; that they have in the series of their movements, to\r\npromote party views, transformed the moral and religions order of the\r\ninstitution, by depriving many of their innocent enjoyment of rights\r\nand privileges for which they had confided in their faith; that they\r\nhave broken down the barriers and violated the Charter, by prostrating\r\nthe rights with which it expressly invests the presidential office;\r\nthat, to subserve their purposes, they have adopted improper methods\r\nin their appointments of executive officers, naturally tending to\r\nembarrass and obstruct the harmonious government and instruction of\r\nthe seminary; that they have extended their powers, which the Charter\r\nconfines to the college, to form connection with an academy[33] in\r\nexclusion of the other academies in the State, cementing an alliance\r\nwith its overseers, and furnishing aid from the college treasury for\r\nits students; that they have perverted the power, which by the\r\nincorporation they ought to exercise over a branch of Moor's Charity\r\nSchool, and have obstructed the application of its fund according to\r\nthe nature of the establishment and the design of the donors; and that\r\ntheir measures have been oppressive to your memorialist in the\r\ndischarge of his office.\r\n\r\n      [33] Kimball Union Academy.\r\n\r\n\"Such are the impressions as now related, arising from the acts and\r\noperations of those who have of late commanded the decisions of the\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\"Your memorialist does not pretend to exhibit their motives, whether\r\nthey have been actuated by erroneous conceptions, or mistaken zeal, or\r\nsome other cause, in attending to the concerns of the institution. But\r\nwith great deference he submits the question, unless men in trust\r\npreserve inviolable faith, whether pledged by words, or action, or\r\nusage, to individuals, unless they continuously keep within the limits\r\nassigned to them by law; if they do not sacredly apply the fruits of\r\nbenevolence committed to their charge, to the destined purpose; if the\r\npublic affairs in their trust are not conducted with openness,\r\nimpartiality, and candor, instead of designed and secret management;\r\nif they become pointedly hostile to those who discern their course,\r\nand honestly oppose their measures which are esteemed destructive; if\r\nthey bear down their inoffensive servants, who are faithful to the\r\ncause of truth, how can an establishment under these circumstances, be\r\nprofitable to mankind? How can there be a gleam of prospective joy to\r\nany except to those who are converting its interest into their own\r\nchannel, to serve a favorite design? What motive, then, will remain to\r\nbenefactors to lay foundations, or to bestow their charities on such\r\nan object?\r\n\r\n\"There is also ground for increasing, fearful apprehension, by adding\r\nto the immediate, what may be the ultimate effect of the measures\r\nwhich have been described. In a collective view they appear to the\r\nbest acquainted and discerning to be, in all their adaptations,\r\ntending to one end, to complete the destruction of the original\r\nprinciples of the college and school, and to establish a new modified\r\nsystem, to strengthen the interests of a party or sect, which, by\r\nextending its influence under the fairest professions, will eventually\r\naffect the political independence of the people, and move the springs\r\nof their government.\r\n\r\n\"To you, revered legislators! the writer submits the foregoing\r\nimportant considerations. He beholds, in your Honorable body, the\r\nsovereign of the State, holding, by the Constitution, and the very\r\nnature of sovereignty in all countries, the sacred right, with your\r\nduty and responsibility to God, to visit and oversee the literary\r\nestablishments, where the manners and feelings of the young are\r\nformed, and grow up in the citizen in after life; to restrain from\r\ninjustice, and rectify abuses in their management, and, if necessary,\r\nto reduce them to their primitive principles, or so modify their\r\npowers as to make them subservient to the public welfare. To your\r\nprotection, and wise arrangements, he submits whatever he holds in\r\nofficial rights by the Charter of the seminary; and to you his\r\ninvaluable rights as a subject and citizen.\r\n\r\n\"He entreats your honorable body to take into consideration the state\r\nand concerns of the college and school, as laid before you.\r\n\r\n\"And as the Legislature have never before found occasion to provide,\r\nby any tribunal, against the evils of the foregoing nature, and their\r\nultimate dangers, he prays that you would please, by a committee\r\ninvested with competent powers, or otherwise, to look into the affairs\r\nand management of the institution, internal and external, already\r\nreferred to, and, if judged expedient in your wisdom, that you would\r\nmake such organic improvements and model reforms in its system and\r\nmovements, as, under Divine Providence, will guard against the\r\ndisorders and their apprehended consequences.\r\n\r\n\"He begs only to add the contemplated joys of the friends of man and\r\nvirtue, in the result of your great wisdom and goodness, which may\r\nsecure this seat of science, so that it may become an increasing\r\nsource of blessings to the State, and to mankind of the present and\r\nsucceeding ages, instead of a theatre for the purpose of a few,\r\nterminating in public calamity.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever disposal your Honorable body may please to make of the\r\nsubject now presented, the subscriber will never cease to maintain the\r\nmost humble deference and dutiful respect.\r\n\r\n    John Wheelock.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would not be profitable, at the present time, to re-open the\r\ndiscussion of the subject matter of the various charges contained in\r\nthe above document, which were so fully elaborated in the \"Sketches,\"\r\nand so carefully considered in the subsequent \"Vindication\" by the\r\nTrustees.\r\n\r\nThe prayer of the Memorial was granted by the Legislature, by the\r\nappointment of a committee of investigation. The following letter is\r\nworthy of careful attention in this connection:\r\n\r\n    \"Exeter, August 15, 1815.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sir,--In common with many others I have felt considerable\r\nanxiety for the issue of the matter so much in public discussion\r\nrelative to Dartmouth College. I do not feel either inclined or\r\ncompetent to give any opinion as to the course which ought finally to\r\nbe adopted by the Board of Trustees for the benefit of that\r\ninstitution. I am entirely willing to leave that to the determination\r\nof those much better informed on the subject and better able to judge.\r\nFrom certain intimations which I have lately had, I am led to believe\r\nan intention is entertained by some members of the Board of ending all\r\ndifficulty with the president by removing him from office. I greatly\r\nfear such a measure adopted under present circumstances, and at the\r\npresent time, would have a very unhappy effect on the public mind. An\r\ninquiry is now pending, instituted after considerable discussion, by\r\nthe Legislature of this State, apparently for the purpose of granting\r\nrelief for the subject matter of complaint. The Trustees acquiesce in\r\nthis inquiry; whether they appear before the committee appointed to\r\nmake it formally as a body, or informally as individuals, the public\r\nwill not deem of much importance. The Legislature, I think, for\r\ncertain purposes, have a right to inquire into an alleged\r\nmismanagement of such an institution, a visitorial power rests in the\r\nState, and I do not deem it important for my present view to determine\r\nin what department or how to be exercised. The Legislature may, on\r\nproper occasion, call it into operation. I have never seen the\r\npresident's memorial to the Legislature, but am told it is an abstract\r\nfrom the 'Pamphlet of Sketches.' From the statements in that I take\r\nthe burthen of his complaint to be, that the Trustees have not given\r\nhim a due and proper share of power and influence in the concerns of\r\nthe college, and that they have improperly used their own power and\r\ninfluence in patronizing and propagating in the college particular\r\ntheological opinions. The alleged misapplication of funds [paid for\r\npreaching] is stated as an instance of such misconduct. These\r\nopinions, it would seem, are particularly disagreeable to the\r\npresident. The whole dispute is made to have a bearing on the\r\npresident personally. Should the Trustees, during the pendency of the\r\ninquiry in a cause in which they are supposed to be a party, take the\r\njudgment into their own hands, and summarily end the dispute by\r\ndestroying the other party, they will offend and irritate at least all\r\nthose who were in favor of making the inquiry. Such will not be\r\nsatisfied with the answer that the Trustees have the power and feel it\r\nto be their duty to exercise it. It will be said that the reasons\r\nwhich justify a removal (if there be any) have existed for a long\r\ntime. A removal after so long forbearance, at the present time, will\r\nbe attributed to recent irritations.\r\n\r\n\"That part of the president's complaint which relates to his religious\r\ngrievances, addresses itself pretty strongly to the prejudices and\r\nfeelings of all those opposed to the sect called Orthodox. This\r\ncomprises all the professed friends of liberal religion, most of the\r\nBaptists and Methodist, and all the nothingarians. The Democrats will\r\nbe against you, of course. All these combined would compose in this\r\nState a numerous and powerful body. Any measure adopted by the\r\nTrustees with the appearance of anger, or haste, will be eagerly\r\nseized on. If the statements of the president are as incorrect as I\r\nhave heard it confidently asserted, an exposure of that incorrectness\r\nwill put the public opinion right. It may require time, but the result\r\nmust be certain. If it can be shown that his complaints are nothing\r\nbut defamatory clamor, he will be reduced to that low condition that\r\nit will be the interest of no sect or party to attempt to hold him up.\r\nI see no danger in delay, but fear much in too great haste. Perhaps\r\nthere is no occasion at present to determine how long the Trustees\r\nshould delay adopting their final course. Circumstances may render\r\nthat expedient at a future time which is not now. I feel much\r\nconfidence that a very decisive course against the president by the\r\nTrustees at the present time would create an unpleasant sensation in\r\nthe public mind, and would, I fear, be attended with unpleasant\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n\"I am sensible I have expressed my opinion very strongly on a subject\r\nin which I have only a common interest. I frankly confess I have been\r\nsomewhat influenced by fears that some of the Trustees will find it\r\ndifficult to free themselves entirely from the effects of the severe\r\nirritation they must have lately experienced.\r\n\r\n    \"I am, dear sir, with esteem,\r\n    \"Sincerely yours.\r\n    \"Jeremiah Mason.\"\r\n    \"C. Marsh, Esq.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Wheelock was removed from office on the 26th of August,\r\n1815, by the vote of a decided majority of the Board, upon grounds of\r\nwhich the following is the substance:\r\n\r\n\"1st. He has had an agency in publishing and circulating a certain\r\nanonymous pamphlet, entitled 'Sketches of the History of Dartmouth\r\nCollege and Moor's Charity School,' and espoused the charges therein\r\ncontained before a committee of the Legislature. The Trustees consider\r\nthis publication a libel on the institution.\r\n\r\n\"2d. He claims a right to exercise the whole executive authority of\r\nthe college, which the Charter has expressly committed to the\r\nTrustees, with the president, professors, and tutors by them\r\nappointed. He also claims a right to control the Corporation in the\r\nappointment of executive officers.\r\n\r\n\"3d. He has caused an impression to be made on the minds of students\r\nunder censure for transgression of the laws of the institution, that\r\nif he could have had his will they would not have suffered disgrace or\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n\"4th. He has taken a youth who was not an Indian, but adopted by an\r\nIndian tribe, and supported him in Moor's School, on the Scotch fund,\r\nwhich is granted for the sole purpose of instructing and civilizing\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\n\"5th. He has, without sufficient ground for such a course, reported\r\nthat the real cause of the dissatisfaction of the Trustees with him\r\nwas a diversity of religious opinions between him and them.\"\r\n\r\nIn taking leave of the second president, we have only to remark, as we\r\nintroduce his eulogist, Mr. Samuel Clesson Allen, that both parties to\r\nthe contest apparently overrated their grievances.\r\n\r\n\"President Wheelock was distinguished for the extent and variety of\r\nhis learning. With a lively curiosity he pushed his inquiries into\r\nevery department of knowledge, and made himself conversant with the\r\nvarious branches of science. But of all the subjects which presented\r\nthemselves to his inquisitive mind those which relate to man in his\r\nintellectual constitution and social relations engaged and fixed his\r\nattention. His favorite branches were Intellectual Philosophy, Ethics,\r\nand Politics. Possessing in an eminent degree the spirit of his\r\nstation, he fulfilled with singular felicity the offices of instructor\r\nand governor in the college. Animated and ardent himself, he could\r\ntransfuse the same holy ardor into the minds of his pupils. What youth\r\never visited him in his study, but returned to his pursuits with a\r\nrenovated spirit, and a loftier sentiment of glory?\r\n\r\n\"He had formed the noblest conceptions of the powers of the human\r\nmind, and of its ultimate progress in knowledge and refinement. This\r\nsentiment called forth the energies of his mind, and gave direction\r\nand character to his inquiries. It pervaded all his instructions, and\r\nimparted to science and to letters their just preëminence among the\r\nobjects of human pursuit.\r\n\r\n\"He never sought to preoccupy the minds of his pupils with his own\r\npeculiar notions, or to impose upon them any favorite system of\r\nopinions. He endeavored to make them proficients in science, and not\r\nthe proselytes of a sect.\r\n\r\n\"In government he commanded more by example than by authority, and the\r\nadmiration of his talents ensured a better obedience than the force of\r\nlaws. His elevation of mind placed him above personal prejudices and\r\nresentments, and jealousies of wounded dignity. He practiced no\r\nespionage upon his pupils, but reposed for the maintenance of order\r\non their sense of propriety, and his own powers of command. He\r\nconciliated their attachment while he inspired their reverence; and he\r\nsecured their attention to the stated exercises and reconciled them to\r\nthe severest studies by the example he exhibited, and the enthusiasm\r\nhe inspired. He knew how to adapt his discipline to the various\r\ndispositions and characters, and could discriminate between the\r\naccidental impulse of a youthful emotion and deliberate acts of\r\nintentional vice.\r\n\r\n\"He was an interesting and powerful speaker. His erect attitude and\r\ndignified action inspired reverence, and commanded attention. But the\r\nwonderful force of his eloquence arose from the strength and sublimity\r\nof his conceptions. Such were his originality of thought, and rich\r\nvariety of expression, that he could present the most common subjects\r\nin new and interesting lights. His public discourses evinced the\r\nstrength of the reasoning faculty, the powers of the imagination, and\r\nthe resources of genius.\r\n\r\n\"He would sometimes conduct the mind with painful subtility through\r\nthe multiplied steps of a long demonstration. At other times he would\r\nglance upon the main topics of his argument, and seize on his\r\nconclusion by a sort of intuitive penetration. He frequently\r\nembellished his subject with the higher ornaments of style, and\r\ndiffused around the severer sciences the graces and elegancies of\r\ntaste. For force of expression he might be compared to Chatham, and in\r\nsplendid imagery he sometimes rivaled Burke. He would, at pleasure,\r\nspread a sudden blaze around his subject or diffuse about it a milder\r\nradiance.\r\n\r\n\"To the interpretation of the Scriptures he carried all the lights\r\nwhich geography, history, and criticism could supply, and poured their\r\nfull effulgence upon the sacred page. His daily prayers always\r\npresenting new views of the works and perfections of the Deity,\r\nexhibited whatever was vast in conception, glowing in expression and\r\ndevout in feeling.\r\n\r\n\"He was probably formed not less for the higher offices of active life\r\nthan for the speculations of science. Distinguished for the boldness\r\nof his enterprise and the decisive energy of his character, he set no\r\nlimits to what individual exertion and effort could accomplish. He\r\nattempted great things with means which other men would have esteemed\r\nwholly inadequate, and the vigor of his mind increased in proportion\r\nto the difficulties he met in the execution of his enterprises. He was\r\ndisheartened by no difficulties, he was intimidated by no dangers, he\r\nwas shaken by no sufferings. The glory which he sought was not the\r\ntemporary applause of this party or that sect, but it was the glory\r\nwhich results from unwearied efforts for the improvement and happiness\r\nof man. He was not less distinguished by the object and character of\r\nhis enterprises than by the great qualities he exhibited in their\r\naccomplishment. His was a high and holy ambition, which, while it\r\npreserved its vigor, identified its objects with those of the purest\r\ncharity.\"\r\n\r\nDartmouth conferred the degree of LL. D. upon President Wheelock in\r\n1789. He died at Hanover, April 4, 1817, his wife, Mrs. Maria (Suhm)\r\nWheelock, daughter of Governor Christian Suhm, of St. Thomas, W. I.,\r\nsurviving him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT BROWN.--CONTEST BETWEEN THE COLLEGE AND\r\nTHE STATE.--TRIUMPH OF THE COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. Francis Brown of North Yarmouth, Maine, was elected the successor\r\nof President Wheelock. His character will be the subject of a later\r\nchapter. He was inaugurated in September, 1815, and entered at once\r\nwith vigor and earnestness upon the performance of his official\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of the New Hampshire Legislature of 1815, Rev. Ephraim\r\nP. Bradford, Nathaniel A. Haven, and Daniel A. White, appointed to\r\ninvestigate the affairs of the college, reported in substance, that\r\nthere was no ground for interference by the State.\r\n\r\nThe deep interest in the college question produced a political\r\nrevolution in the State. In his message to the Legislature at the\r\nopening of the session in June, 1816, Governor Plumer says:\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to invite your consideration to the state and condition of\r\nDartmouth College, the head of our learned institutions. As the State\r\nhas contributed liberally to the establishment of its funds, and as\r\nour constituents have a deep interest in its prosperity, it has a\r\nstrong claim to our attention. The charter of that college was granted\r\nDecember 13th, 1769, by John Wentworth, who was then Governor of New\r\nHampshire, under the authority of the British king. As it emanated\r\nfrom royalty, it contained, as was natural it should, principles\r\ncongenial to monarchy; among others, it established Trustees, made\r\nseven a quorum, and authorized a majority of those present to remove\r\nany of its members which they might consider unfit or incapable, and\r\nthe survivors to perpetuate the Board by themselves, electing others\r\nto supply vacancies. This last principle is hostile to the spirit and\r\ngenius of a free government. Sound policy therefore requires that the\r\nmode of election should be changed, and that Trusties, in future,\r\nshould be elected by some other body of men.\r\n\r\n\"The college was founded for the public good, not for the benefit or\r\nemolument of its Trustees; and the right to amend and improve acts of\r\nincorporation of this nature has been exercised by all governments,\r\nboth monarchical and republican. In the Charter of Dartmouth College\r\nit is expressly provided that the president, trustees, professors,\r\ntutors and other officers, shall take the oath of allegiance to the\r\nBritish king; but if the laws of the United States, as well as those\r\nof New Hampshire, abolished by implication that part of the Charter,\r\nmuch more might they have done it directly and by express words. These\r\nfacts show the authority of the Legislature to interfere upon this\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Plumer communicated this message to Jefferson, who replied in\r\nhis letter of July 21, 1816: \"It is replete with sound principles, and\r\ntruly republican. Some articles, too, are worthy of notice. The idea\r\nthat institutions established for the use of the nation cannot be\r\ntouched nor modified, even to make them answer their end, because of\r\nrights gratuitously supposed in those employed to manage them in trust\r\nfor the public, may, perhaps, be a salutary provision against the\r\nabuses of a monarch, but it is most absurd against the nation itself.\r\nYet our lawyers and priests generally inculcate this doctrine, and\r\nsuppose that preceding generations held the earth more freely than we\r\ndo; had a right to impose laws on us, unalterable by ourselves; and\r\nthat we, in like manner, can make laws and impose burdens on future\r\ngenerations, which they will have no right to alter; in fine, that the\r\nearth belongs to the dead, and not to the living.\"\r\n\r\nThe following action shows the result:\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned, three of the members of the Board of Trustees of\r\nDartmouth College, having this morning seen a printed copy of a bill\r\nbefore the Honorable House [of the New Hampshire Legislature], the\r\nprovisions of which, should they go into effect would set aside the\r\nCharter of the college, and wholly change the administration of its\r\nconcerns, beg leave respectfully to remonstrate against its passage.\r\nThe provisions of the bill referred to change the name of the\r\ncorporation; enlarge the number of Trustees; alter the number to\r\nconstitute a quorum; render persons living out of the State, who are\r\nnow eligible, hereafter ineligible; vacate the seats of those members\r\nwho are not inhabitants of the State; deprive the Trustees of the\r\nright of electing members to supply vacancies; and give to the new\r\nBoard of Trustees an arbitrary power of annulling everything\r\nheretofore transacted by the Trustees; and this last without the\r\nconcurrence of the proposed Board of Overseers. The consent of the\r\npresent Board of Trustees is in no instance contemplated as necessary\r\nto give validity to the new act of incorporation.\r\n\r\n\"In the opinion of the undersigned, these changes, modifications, and\r\nalterations effectually destroy the present Charter of the college and\r\nconstitute a new one.\r\n\r\n\"Should the bill become a law, it will be obvious to our fellow\r\ncitizens that the Trustees of Dartmouth College will have been\r\ndeprived of their Charter rights without having been summoned or\r\nnotified of any such proceeding against them. It will be equally\r\nobvious to our fellow citizens that the facts reported by the\r\ncommittee of investigation [of the last Legislature] did not form the\r\nground and basis of the new act of incorporation; and that no evidence\r\nof facts of any sort, relating to the official conduct of the\r\nTrustees, other than the report of the committee of investigation, was\r\nsubmitted to your Honorable Bodies.\r\n\r\n\"To deprive a Board of Trustees of their Charter rights, after they\r\nhave been accused of gross misconduct in office, without requiring any\r\nproof whatever of such misconduct, appears to your remonstrants\r\nunjust, and not conformable to the spirit of the free and happy\r\ngovernment under which we live. If the property has been misapplied,\r\nif there has been any abuse of power upon the part of the Trustees,\r\nthey are fully sensible of their high responsibility; but they have\r\nalways believed, and still believe, that a sound construction of the\r\npowers granted to the Legislature, gives them, in this case, only the\r\nright to order, for good cause, a prosecution in the judicial courts.\r\n\r\n\"A different course effectually blends judicial and legislative\r\npowers, and constitutes the Legislature a judicial tribunal.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned also beg leave to remonstrate against the passage of\r\nthe bill, on the ground of inexpediency. A corporation is a creature\r\nof the law, to which certain powers, rights, and privileges are\r\ngranted; and amongst others that of holding property. Destroy this\r\ncreature, this body politic, and all its property immediately reverts\r\nto its former owners. This doctrine has long been recognized and\r\nestablished in all governments of law. Any material alteration of the\r\ncorporation, without its consent, and certainly such essential\r\nalterations as the bill under consideration is intended to make, will\r\nbe followed with the same effect. The funds belonging to the college,\r\nalthough not great, are highly important to the institution; and a\r\nconsiderable proportion of them were granted by, and lie in, the State\r\nof Vermont. The undersigned most earnestly entreat the Honorable\r\nLegislature not to put the funds of the college in jeopardy; not to\r\nput at hazard substantial income, under expectations which may or may\r\nnot be realized.\"\r\n\r\nAfter alluding to lack of precedent for the proposed action, and the\r\nnecessary increase of expenditures which would result from its\r\nconsummation, they proceed to say: \"If the provisions of this bill\r\nshould take effect, we greatly fear that the concerns of the college\r\nwill be drawn into the vortex of political controversy. We refer\r\nparticularly to that section of the bill which gives the appointment\r\nof Trustees and Overseers to the Governor and Council. The whole\r\nhistory of the United States for the last twenty years teaches us a\r\nlesson which ought not to be kept out of view. Our literary\r\ninstitutions hitherto have been preserved from the influence of party.\r\nThe tendency of this bill, unless we greatly mistake, is to convert\r\nthe peaceful retreat of our college into a field for party warfare.\r\n\r\n\"Whilst the undersigned deem it their indispensable duty to\r\nremonstrate in the most respectful terms against the passage of the\r\nbill referred to, they have no objection, and they have no reason to\r\nbelieve their fellow Trustees have any objection, to the passage of a\r\nlaw connecting the government of the State with that of the college,\r\nand creating every salutary check and restraint upon the official\r\nconduct of the Trustees and their successors that can be reasonably\r\nrequired, and with respectful deference they would propose the\r\nfollowing outlines of a plan for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\"The Councillors and Senators of New Hampshire together with the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives for the time being, shall\r\nconstitute a Board of Overseers of Dartmouth College, any ten of whom\r\nshall be a quorum for transacting business. The Overseers shall meet\r\nannually at the college, on the day preceding Commencement. They shall\r\nhave an independent right to organize their own body, and to form\r\ntheir own rules; but as soon as they shall have organized themselves\r\nthey shall give information thereof to the Trustees. Whenever any vote\r\nshall have been passed by the Trustees it shall be communicated to the\r\nOverseers, and shall not have effect until it shall have the\r\nconcurrence of the Overseers. Provided, nevertheless, that if at any\r\nmeeting a quorum of the Overseers shall not be formed, the Trustees\r\nshall have full power to confer degrees, in the same manner as though\r\nthere were no Overseers; and also to appoint Trustees or other\r\nofficers (not a president or professor), and to enact such laws as the\r\ninterests of the institution shall indispensably require; but no law\r\npassed by the Trustees shall in such case have force longer than until\r\nthe next annual meeting of the Boards, unless it shall then be\r\napproved by the Overseers. Neither of the Boards shall adjourn, except\r\nfrom day to day, without the consent of the other. It shall be the\r\nduty of the president of the college, whenever in his opinion the\r\ninterests of the institution shall require it, or whenever requested\r\nthereto by three Trustees, or three Overseers, to call special\r\nmeetings of both Boards, causing notice to be given in writing to each\r\nTrustee and Overseer, of the time and place; but no meeting of one\r\nBoard shall ever be called except at the same time and place with the\r\nother. It shall be the duty of the president of the college annually,\r\nin the month of May, to transmit to his Excellency, the Governor, a\r\nfull and particular account of the state of the funds, the number of\r\nstudents and their progress, and generally the state and condition of\r\nthe college.\r\n\r\n\"If the plan above suggested should meet the approbation of the\r\nHonorable Legislature, and good men of all parties give it their\r\nsanction, we may all anticipate, with high satisfaction, the future\r\nprosperity of the college, and its incalculable usefulness to the\r\nState; but if a union of the friends of literature and science, of all\r\nparties and sects, cannot be attained; if the triumph of one party\r\nover the other be absolutely indispensable; fearful apprehensions must\r\nfill the mind of every considerate man, every dispassionate friend of\r\nDartmouth College.\r\n\r\n    Thos. W. Thompson,\r\n    Elijah Paine,\r\n    Asa M'Farland.\r\n\r\n    \"June 19, 1816.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe effect of this proposed compromise was a modification of the bill\r\nin some of its important features. Against the amended bill, which was\r\npassed a few days afterward, there was a farther protest, from which\r\nwe make brief extracts.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned would not trouble the Honorable Legislature with any\r\nremarks in addition to those contained in their remonstrance of the\r\n19th inst. did they not believe it was a duty not to be omitted.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the amended bill, they continue:\r\n\r\n\"They have not been able to obtain a sight of it, but have heard it\r\ncontains provisions for an increase of the Board of Trustees to the\r\nnumber of twenty-one, a majority of whom to constitute a quorum, and\r\nthat the additional number are to be appointed by His Excellency the\r\nGovernor and the Honorable the Council. To many of the topics of\r\nargument, suggested in their former remonstrance (which are equally\r\napplicable against the passage of the bill in its present shape) they\r\nrespectfully ask leave to add, that the bill in its present shape\r\ndestroys the identity of the corporation, known in the law by the name\r\nof the Trustees of Dartmouth College, without the consent of the\r\ncorporation, and consequently the corporation to be created by the\r\npresent bill must and will be deemed by courts of law altogether\r\ndiverse and distinct from the corporation to which all the grants of\r\nproperty have hitherto been made; and therefore the new corporation\r\ncannot hold the property granted to the corporation created by the\r\ncharter of 1769.\r\n\r\n\"By the Charter of Dartmouth College a contract was made by the then\r\nsupreme power of the State with the twelve persons therein named, by\r\nwhich, when accepted by the persons therein named, certain rights and\r\nprivileges were vested in them and their successors, for the guarantee\r\nof which the faith of government was pledged by necessary implication.\r\nIn the same instrument the faith of government was pledged that the\r\ncorporation should consist of twelve persons and no more. The change\r\nin the government of the State, since taken place, does not in the\r\nleast possible degree impair the validity of this contract,--otherwise\r\nnearly all the titles to real estate, held by our fellow citizens,\r\nmust be deemed invalid.\r\n\r\n\"The passage of the bill now before the Honorable House will, in the\r\ndeliberate opinion of the undersigned, violate the plighted faith of\r\nthe government. If the undersigned are correct in considering the\r\nCharter of 1769 in the nature of a contract, and if the bill, in its\r\npresent shape, becomes a law, we think it necessarily follows that it\r\nwill also violate an important clause in the 10th section of the 1st\r\narticle in the Constitution of the United States, which provides, that\r\nno State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.\r\n\r\n\"The Honorable Legislature will permit us to add, that as it is well\r\nknown that the Trustees have, as a Board, been divided on certain\r\nimportant subjects, although the minority has been very small, should\r\nthe Legislature now provide for nine new Trustees, to be appointed by\r\nHis Excellency the Governor and the Honorable the Council, and that\r\nwithout any facts being proved to the Legislature, or any Legislative\r\nreport having been made, showing that the state of things at the\r\ncollege rendered the measure necessary, it must be seen by our fellow\r\ncitizens that the majority of the Trustees have been by the\r\nLegislature, for some unacknowledged cause, condemned unheard.\r\n\r\n    Thomas W. Thompson,\r\n    Asa M'Farland.\r\n\r\n    \"June 24, 1816.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of the Governor in substance, became a law; the\r\nname of the college was changed to \"University;\" the number of the\r\nTrustees was increased to twenty-one; a Board of Overseers was\r\ncreated, to be appointed by the Governor and Council; the president\r\nand professors of the university were required to take an oath to\r\nsupport the Constitution of the United States, and of the State of New\r\nHampshire; and the act provided that \"perfect freedom of religious\r\nopinion should be enjoyed by all the students and officers of the\r\nuniversity.\" The committee to whom the message, etc., relating to this\r\nsubject, were referred, it should be remarked, did not undertake to\r\ndecide in favor of either party to the controversy, but alleged that\r\nthe troubles arose from certain defects in the Charter, and that they\r\nwould recur again in some form, unless those defects were remedied.\r\n\r\nThe debates upon the historical and constitutional questions involved\r\nwere able. The minority were ably led, both inside and outside the\r\nLegislature, but parliamentary tactics availed them nothing. Many of\r\nthem joined in a written protest against the passage of the bill, the\r\nsubstance of which has already appeared in the action of the Trustees.\r\n\r\nDirectly after the passage of this bill Mr. Marsh prepared an\r\nelaborate argument, never published, setting forth the essence of the\r\nleading points of the case, as viewed by the majority of the old\r\nTrustees.\r\n\r\nThe following letter, addressed to Mr. Timothy Bigelow, Boston, is\r\nworthy of notice in this connection:\r\n\r\n    \"Concord, July 27, 1816.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir: Dr. McFarland will do himself the pleasure to hand you\r\nthis. In him you will recognize an old acquaintance. We wish to get\r\nthe opinions of as many legal friends as we can upon the question of\r\nlegitimate power in the New Hampshire Legislature, to pass the act\r\nrelating to Dartmouth College, and with regard to the course the old\r\nTrustees ought to pursue. It is an interest, we think, common to all\r\nwell wishers to New England.\r\n\r\n\"The old Trustees, I am confident, are willing to take just that\r\ncourse that their wisest and best friends recommend.\r\n\r\n\"Very cordially yours,\r\n\r\n    Thomas W. Thompson.\"\r\n\r\nAugust 28, 1816, a majority of the old Trustees formally refused to\r\naccept the provisions of the act.\r\n\r\nA meeting of the Trustees of the university, under the act of June 27,\r\n1816, was called, but through the illness of a single member, failed\r\nfor want of a quorum. The judges of the Superior Court, on December 5,\r\n1816, in answer to the Governor and Council, gave their opinion that\r\nthe executive department had no authority to fill the vacancies which\r\nhad occurred. To remedy this, the Legislature, on December 18, 1816,\r\npassed an additional act providing for filling the vacancies, the\r\ncalling of meetings and fixing a quorum; and on December 26, 1816,\r\npassed another act imposing the penalty of five hundred dollars upon\r\nany person who should assume any office in the university except by\r\nvirtue of the preceding acts.\r\n\r\nIn view of this action President Brown writes to Mr. Timothy Farrar,\r\nof Portsmouth, January 3, 1817:\r\n\r\n\"Now, what shall we do? One of these four courses must be taken. We\r\nmust either keep possession and go on to teach as usual, without any\r\nregard to the law, or, withdrawing from the college edifice and all\r\nthe college property, continue to instruct as the officers of\r\nDartmouth College; or, relinquishing this name for the present,\r\ncollect as many students as will join us, and instruct them as private\r\nbut associated individuals; or else we must give all up and disperse.\r\nWill you give us your opinion, what may be duty or what expedient, as\r\nsoon as convenient? Particularly, will you give us your opinion\r\nwhether, supposing this oppressive act to be judged constitutional, we\r\nshould be liable to the fine, if we instruct as the officers of\r\nDartmouth College, relinquishing, however, the college buildings, the\r\nlibrary, apparatus, etc.\"\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of the college issued the following:\r\n\r\n\"ADDRESS OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF DARTMOUTH COLLEGE TO THE PUBLIC.\r\n\r\n\"As the undersigned, after the most serious and mature consideration,\r\nhave determined to retain the offices which they received by the\r\nappointment of the Trustees of Dartmouth College, and not voluntarily\r\nto surrender, at present, any property committed to them, nor to\r\nrelinquish any privileges pertaining to their offices, they believe it\r\nto be a duty, which they owe to the public no less than to themselves,\r\nto make an explicit declaration of the principles by which they are\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\n\"They begin by stating the two following positions, as maxims of\r\npolitical morality, which they deem incontrovertible:\r\n\r\n\"1. It is wrong, under any form of government, for a citizen or\r\nsubject to refuse compliance with the will of the sovereign power,\r\nwhen that will is fully expressed, except in cases where the rights of\r\nconscience are invaded, or where oppression is practiced to such an\r\nextreme degree that the great ends of civil government are defeated or\r\nhighly endangered.\r\n\r\n\"2. Under a free government, where the sovereignty is exercised by\r\nseveral distinct branches, whose respective powers are created and\r\ndefined by written constitutions, cases may arise in which it will be\r\nthe duty of the citizen to delay conforming to the ordinances of one\r\nbranch until the other branches shall have had opportunity to act. If,\r\nfor example, the legislative branch should transcend its legitimate\r\npower, and assume to perform certain acts which the Constitution had\r\nassigned to the province of the judicial branch, a citizen,\r\ninjuriously affected by those acts, might be bound, not indeed\r\nforcibly to resist them, but, in the manner pointed out by law, to\r\nmake an appeal to the judiciary and to await its decision.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned deem it unnecessary, in this place, to detail the\r\nprovisions of the acts of the Honorable Legislature, passed in June\r\nand December, A. D. 1816, relating to this institution. Those acts are\r\nbefore the public and are generally understood.\r\n\r\n\"The Board of Trustees, as constituted by the Charter of 1769, at\r\ntheir annual meeting in August last, took into consideration the act\r\nof June, and adopted a resolution, 'not to accept its provisions.' In\r\nthe preamble to this resolution, we find a paragraph in the words\r\nfollowing: 'They (the Trustees) find the law fully settled and\r\nrecognized in almost every case which has arisen, wherein a\r\ncorporation or any member or officer is a party, that no man or body\r\nof men is bound to accept, or act under, any grant or gift of\r\ncorporate powers and privileges; and that no existing corporation is\r\nbound to accept, but may decline or refuse to accept any act or grant\r\nconferring additional powers or privileges, or making any restriction\r\nor limitation of those they already possess; and in case a grant is\r\nmade to individuals or to a corporation without application, it is to\r\nbe regarded not as an act obligatory or binding upon them, but as an\r\noffer or proposition to confer such powers and privileges, or the\r\nexpression of a desire to have them accept such restrictions, which\r\nthey are at liberty to accept or reject.'\r\n\r\n\"If the doctrine contained in this paragraph be correct, and of its\r\ncorrectness the undersigned, after ascertaining the opinion of eminent\r\njurists in most of the New England States, entertain no doubt, the act\r\nof June, and of course the acts of December, have become inoperative,\r\nin consequence of the nonacceptance of them by the Charter Trustees,\r\nand the provisions of these acts are not binding upon the corporation\r\nor its officers. We take the liberty to add, that, in our opinion, the\r\nreasons assigned by the Trustees in the preamble before mentioned for\r\nnot accepting the act of June, are very important and amply\r\nsufficient. Indeed, it has ever appeared to us, that the changes\r\nproposed to be introduced into the charter by the acts in question,\r\nwould have proved highly inauspicious to the welfare of this\r\ninstitution, and ultimately injurious to the interests of literature\r\nthroughout our country.\r\n\r\n\"The Trustees appointed agreeably to the provisions of the act of June\r\nhave, however, thought proper to organize, without the concurrence of\r\nthe Charter Trustees, and to perform numerous decisive acts.\r\n\r\n\"At a meeting in Concord on the fourth instant, they brought several\r\nspecifications of charges against the undersigned; and at an adjourned\r\nmeeting, holden on the twenty-second instant, they proceeded to\r\ndisplace, discharge, and remove them from their respective offices in\r\nDartmouth University. A similar procedure was adopted against four of\r\nthe Trustees acting under the Charter.\r\n\r\n\"Unless we greatly mistake, in the view already expressed of the act\r\nof June, the votes of the university Trustees, removing us from\r\noffice, are wholly unauthorized and destitute of any legal effect; and\r\nwe are still, as we have uniformly claimed to be, officers of\r\nDartmouth College under the charter of 1769.\r\n\r\n\"The Charter Trustees having resolved to assert their corporate\r\nrights, and having, for this purpose, recently commenced a suit\r\nagainst their late Secretary and Treasurer, in the issue of which it\r\nis expected the question between them and their competitors will be\r\nfinally settled, the undersigned, being united with them in opinion,\r\nin principle, and in feeling, cannot consent to abandon them, or to\r\nperform any act which may prejudice their claims, while this suit is\r\npending. They must therefore proceed, as officers of Dartmouth\r\nCollege, to discharge their prescribed duties. They are sensible of\r\ntheir obligation to render submission to the laws, and their first\r\ninquiry, in the case before them, has been, What is law? The result is\r\na full conviction in their own minds, that the course they have\r\nconcluded to adopt is strictly legal, and that no other course would\r\nbe consistent with their duty. If they err, their error will shortly\r\nbe corrected by the decision of our highest judicial tribunals; and\r\nwith this decision they will readily comply. In the meantime, while\r\nthe appeal is made to the laws of their country, and to the\r\nconstitutions of this State and of the United States, which are the\r\nsupreme law, they trust that none of their fellow-citizens will have\r\nthe unkindness to charge them with a want of respect to the government\r\nunder which they live. As soon as the will of the government shall be\r\nfairly expressed, they will render to it a prompt obedience.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned are placed in a situation singularly difficult and\r\nhighly responsible. To them it seems to be allotted in Divine\r\nProvidence, to perform a part which, in its consequences, may deeply\r\naffect the interests not only of this institution, but of all similar\r\ninstitutions in this country. And although they are fully conscious of\r\ntheir own inability to perform this part in a manner worthy of its\r\nimportance, yet they are firmly resolved, relying on divine\r\nassistance, not to shrink from any duty, or any danger, which it may\r\ninvolve.\r\n\r\n\"The penal act of December they cannot but regard as unnecessarily\r\nsevere; nor do they see what purpose it was calculated to answer,\r\nexcept to influence them, by the prospect of embarrassing suits, to an\r\nabandonment of their trust. They are aware that men may be found\r\ndisposed to multiply prosecutions against them, and to despoil them of\r\nthe little property they possess; but they believe themselves called\r\nin Providence not to shun this hazard, as they cannot reconcile it\r\nwith their obligation to the institution under their care, to\r\nrelinquish the places they occupy, until it shall be ascertained that\r\nthey cannot rightfully retain them.\r\n\r\n\"As the university Trustees have expressed a great regard for the\r\nlaws, the undersigned have a right to expect that neither they, or any\r\nagents appointed by them, will resort to illegal measures to seize on\r\nthe college buildings and property. Should such measures unhappily be\r\nadopted, the undersigned will make no forcible resistance, it not\r\nbeing a part of their policy to repel violence by violence. They will\r\nquietly withdraw where they cannot peaceably retain possession, and,\r\nwith the best accommodations they can procure, will continue to\r\ninstruct the classes committed to them, until the prevalence of other\r\ncounsels shall procure a repeal of the injurious acts, or until the\r\ndecision of the law shall convince them of their error, or restore\r\nthem to their rights.\r\n\r\n    \"Francis Brown,\r\n    \"Ebenezer Adams,\r\n    \"Roswell Shurtleff.\r\n\r\n    \"February 28, 1817.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe above gentlemen constituted the permanent Faculty at this period.\r\nIn view of all the circumstances they determined to surrender the\r\ncollege buildings and library to their opponents, and the Trustees\r\ndetermined to test their rights before the courts, the action being\r\nbrought against the former Treasurer, who adhered to the \"University\"\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\"The action: 'The Trustees of Dartmouth College _v._ William H.\r\nWoodward,' was commenced in the Court of Common Pleas, Grafton County,\r\nState of New Hampshire, February Term, 1817. The declaration was\r\ntrover for the books of record, original charter, common seal, and\r\nother corporate property of the college. The conversion was alleged\r\nto have been made on the 7th day of October, 1816. The proper pleas\r\nwere filed, and by consent the cause was carried directly to the\r\nSuperior Court of New Hampshire, by appeal, and entered at the May\r\nTerm, 1817. The general issue was pleaded by the defendant, and joined\r\nby the plaintiffs. The facts in the case were then agreed upon by the\r\nparties, and drawn up in the form of a special verdict, reciting the\r\nCharter of the college and the acts of the Legislature of the State,\r\npassed June and December, 1816, by which the said corporation of\r\nDartmouth College was enlarged and improved, and the said Charter\r\namended.\r\n\r\n\"The question made in the case was, whether those acts of the\r\nLegislature were valid and binding upon the corporation, without their\r\nacceptance or assent, and not repugnant to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. If so, the verdict found for the defendants; otherwise\r\nit found for the plaintiffs.\r\n\r\n\"The cause was continued to the September Term of the court in\r\nRockingham County, where it was argued; and at the November term of\r\nthe same year, in Grafton County, the opinion of the court was\r\ndelivered by Chief Justice Richardson, sustaining the validity and\r\nconstitutionality of the acts of the Legislature; and judgment was\r\naccordingly entered for the defendant on the special verdict.\r\n\r\n\"Thereupon a writ of error was sued out by the original plaintiffs, to\r\nremove the cause to the Supreme Court of the United States, where it\r\nwas entered at the term of the court holden at Washington on the first\r\nMonday of February, 1818.\r\n\r\n\"The cause came on for argument on the 10th day of March 1818, before\r\nall the judges. It was argued by Mr. Webster and Mr. Hopkinson, for\r\nthe plaintiffs in error, and by Mr. Holmes and the Attorney-general\r\n(Wirt), for the defendant in error.\r\n\r\n\"At the term of the court holden in February, 1819, the opinion of the\r\njudges was delivered by Chief Justice Marshall, declaring the acts of\r\nthe Legislature unconstitutional and invalid, and reversing the\r\njudgment of the State court. The court, with the exception of Mr.\r\nJustice Duvall, were unanimous.\"\r\n\r\nThe arguments in the New Hampshire court by Messrs. Mason, Smith, and\r\nWebster for the college, and Messrs. Sullivan and Bartlett for Mr.\r\nWoodward; the decision of that court, and the cause in the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, are an important part of our country's\r\njudicial history. The result was logically based upon prior decisions\r\nof the Supreme Court. We invite special attention to one point in Mr.\r\nWebster's argument. If, in the lapse of time, under the strong light\r\nof careful research or elaborate criticism, all the other brilliant\r\ncolors of this remarkable fabric shall fade or vanish, this central\r\nfigure will remain forever, to illustrate the relations of the college\r\nto the State.\r\n\r\n\"The State of Vermont is a principal donor to Dartmouth College. The\r\nlands given lie in that State. This appears in the special verdict. Is\r\nVermont to be considered as having intended a gift to the State of New\r\nHampshire in this case, as, it has been said, is to be the reasonable\r\nconstruction of all donations to the college? The Legislature of New\r\nHampshire affects to represent the public, and therefore claims a\r\nright to control all property destined to public use. What hinders\r\nVermont from considering herself equally the representative of the\r\npublic, and from resuming her grants, at her own pleasure? Her right\r\nto do so is less doubtful than the power of New Hampshire to pass the\r\nlaws in question.\"\r\n\r\nThus closed one of the most important contests in the history of\r\nAmerican jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nLaw, politics, literature, and religion combined to make it a subject\r\nof national concern. The decision gave to a large class of chartered\r\ninstitutions a security never enjoyed before. The lapse of more than\r\nhalf a century enables us to consider the question calmly and\r\ncandidly, uninfluenced by interest, prejudice, or passion.\r\n\r\nThe case was attended with serious embarrassments. Neither counsel nor\r\ncourt had thorough knowledge of the history of the school and the\r\ncollege, and the relations of each to the other. Had they possessed\r\nthis knowledge, the line of argument in some respects would have been\r\nvery different, although perhaps with the same general results. More\r\nthan this, there were no precedents. Indeed, at that early day\r\nquestions of constitutional law had occupied very little of the\r\nattention of the American courts.\r\n\r\nThere would have been embarrassment had the British Parliament, before\r\nour Revolution, assumed the right to alter materially the Charter of\r\nthe college. Changes in chartered institutions in America, especially,\r\nby that body, although within the scope of its power, were usually met\r\nwith the sternest protests. After the Revolution, there were wide\r\ndifferences of opinion as to who had power over charters granted\r\nantecedent to that event. In the case of Dartmouth's Charter any one\r\nof several opinions might have found plausible support. To determine\r\nwhether it was a fit matter for State or national legislation, or\r\njudicial control, we must revert to the history of the Charter. There\r\nwe find that it was the unvarying purpose of the founder, adhered to\r\nthrough a long period of severe and persistent effort, to obtain a\r\nCharter which would enable him to locate his school or schools in any\r\nof the American colonies. He was determined to be as free as possible\r\nfrom local obligations and local control. There can be no doubt that\r\nin securing the Charter of the college he believed that he had\r\naccomplished a similar purpose. The Charter appointed as a majority of\r\nthe first Board of Trustees residents in Connecticut,--making it for\r\nthe time being, by design of the founder, for good and sufficient\r\nreasons, in a sense, a Connecticut institution,--with a provision that\r\nafter the lapse of a brief period a majority of the Board should be\r\nresidents in New Hampshire. In writing upon this subject to a business\r\ncorrespondent, in June, 1777, President Wheelock says, referring to a\r\nthird party: \"Let him see how amply this incorporation is endowed, and\r\nhow independent it is made of this government or any other\r\nincorporation,\" and adds that \"a matter of controversy\" relating to\r\nthe township granted by the king to the college nearly at the same\r\ntime with the Charter, \"can be decided by no judicatory but supreme,\r\nor one equal to that which incorporated it, _i. e._, the Continental\r\nCongress.\"\r\n\r\nThe views of no one person will be received by all, as conclusive on\r\na subject of so much importance. But certainly, Eleazar Wheelock had a\r\nright to construe the provisions of an instrument which in almost\r\nevery line bore his impress, never possessed by any other individual.\r\n\r\nHad John Wheelock presented his grievances to the National\r\nLegislature,--only in a limited sense, it is true, if at all, the\r\nsuccessor of that king, whose grant of Landaff, in addition to the\r\nCollege Charter, made him, in a sense, according to Coke, the founder\r\nof the college,--he might, in all probability, have obtained what he\r\ndesired in a peaceful manner, although an important judicial decision\r\nmight never have occupied its present place in American law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF PRESIDENT BROWN.--TRIBUTES BY PROFESSOR HADDOCK AND RUFUS\r\nCHOATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Sprague's \"Annals of the American Pulpit,\" we find, in substance,\r\nthe following notice of President Brown:\r\n\r\nFrancis Brown was the son of Benjamin and Prudence (Kelley) Brown, and\r\nwas born at Chester, Rockingham County, N. H., January 11, 1784. His\r\nfather was a merchant, and had a highly respectable standing in\r\nsociety. His mother was a person of superior intellect and heart, and,\r\nthough she died when he had only reached his tenth year, she had\r\nimpressed upon him some of the most striking of her own\r\ncharacteristics; particularly her uncommon love of order and\r\npropriety, even in the most minute concerns, and her uncompromising\r\nadherence to her own convictions of truth and right. In his early\r\nboyhood he evinced the utmost eagerness in the pursuit of knowledge,\r\nand never suffered any opportunity for intellectual improvement to\r\nescape him. At the age of fourteen, he ventured to ask his father to\r\nfurnish him with the means of a collegiate education; but, in\r\nconsideration of his somewhat straitened circumstances, he felt\r\nconstrained to deny the request. By a subsequent marriage, however,\r\nhis circumstances were improved; and the new mother of young Brown,\r\nwith most commendable generosity, assumed the pecuniary responsibility\r\nof his going to college. He always cherished the most grateful\r\nrecollection of her kindness; and, but a few days before his death, he\r\nsaid to her with the deepest filial sensibility, \"My dear mother,\r\nwhatever good I have done in the world, and whatever honor I have\r\nreceived, I owe it all to you.\"\r\n\r\nIn his sixteenth year he became a member of Atkinson Academy, then\r\nunder the care of the Hon. John Vose, and among the most respectable\r\ninstitutions of the kind in New England. His instructor has rendered\r\nthe following testimony concerning him at that period: \"Though he made\r\nno pretensions to piety during his residence at the academy, he was\r\nexceedingly amiable in his affections and moral in his deportment. It\r\nis very rare we find an individual in whom so many excellencies\r\ncentre. To a sweet disposition was united a strong mind; to an\r\naccuracy which examined the minutiæ of everything a depth of\r\ninvestigation which penetrated the most profound. I recollect that\r\nwhen I wrote recommending him to college, I informed Dr. Wheelock I\r\nhad sent him an Addison.\"\r\n\r\nOf the formation of his religious character little more is known than\r\nthat it was of silent, yet steady growth. It was not till the year\r\nthat he became a tutor in college that he made a public profession of\r\nhis faith, by connecting himself with the church in his native place.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1802 he joined the Freshman class of Dartmouth\r\nCollege, and, during the whole period of his collegiate course, was a\r\nmodel of persevering diligence, of gentle and winning manners, and\r\npure and elevated morality. From college he carried with him the\r\nrespect and love of both teachers and students. Having spent the year\r\nsucceeding his graduation as a private tutor in the family of the\r\nvenerable Judge Paine, of Williamstown, Vt., he was appointed to a\r\ntutorship in the college at which he had graduated. This office he\r\naccepted, and for three years discharged its duties with great ability\r\nand fidelity, while, at the same time, he was pursuing theological\r\nstudies with reference to his future profession.\r\n\r\nHaving received license to preach from the Grafton Association, he\r\nresigned his tutorship at the Commencement in 1809, with a view to\r\ngive himself solely to the work of the ministry. After declining\r\nseveral flattering applications for his services, he accepted an\r\ninvitation from the Congregational Church in North Yarmouth, Me., to\r\nbecome their pastor; and he was accordingly ordained there on his\r\nbirthday, January 11, 1810. Within a few months from this time, he was\r\nchosen Professor of Languages at Dartmouth College; but this\r\nappointment he was pleased, greatly to the joy of his parishioners, to\r\ndecline. For the succeeding five years he labored with great zeal and\r\nsuccess among his people, while his influence was sensibly felt in\r\nsustaining and advancing the interests of learning and religion\r\nthroughout the State. He was the intimate friend of the lamented\r\nPresident Appleton; and no one, perhaps, coöperated with the president\r\nmore vigrously than he, in increasing the resources and extending the\r\ninfluence of Bowdoin College.\r\n\r\nHe was inaugurated President of Dartmouth College, on the 27th of\r\nSeptember, 1815.\r\n\r\nDuring the period when the college controversy was at its height, and\r\nit seemed difficult to predict its issue, Mr. Brown was invited to the\r\npresidency of Hamilton College,--a respectable and flourishing\r\ninstitution in the State of New York. He did not, however, feel at\r\nliberty to accept the invitation, considering himself so identified\r\nwith the college with which he was then connected that he must share\r\neither its sinking or rising fortunes.\r\n\r\nPresident Brown's labors were too severe for his constitution. He was\r\nnot only almost constantly engaged during the week in the instruction\r\nand general supervision of the college, but most of his Sabbaths were\r\nspent in preaching to destitute congregations in the neighborhood;\r\nand, during his vacations, he was generally traveling with a view to\r\nincrease the college funds. Soon after the Commencement in 1818, he\r\nbegan to show some symptoms of pulmonary disease, and these symptoms\r\ncontinued, and assumed a more aggravated form, under the best medical\r\nprescriptions. His last effort in the pulpit was at Thetford, Vt.,\r\nOctober 6, 1818. In the hope of recovering from his disease, he\r\ntraveled into the western part of New York, but no substantial relief\r\nwas obtained. In the fall of 1819, with a view to try the effect of a\r\nmilder climate, he journeyed as far south as South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia, where he spent the following winter and spring. He returned\r\nin the month of June, and, though he was greeted by his friends and\r\npupils with the most affectionate welcome, they all saw, from his\r\npallid countenance and emaciated form, that he had only come home to\r\ndie. As he was unable to appear in public, he invited the Senior\r\nclass, who were about to leave college at the commencement of their\r\nlast vacation, to visit him in his chamber; and there he addressed to\r\nthem, with the solemnity of a spirit just ready to take its flight,\r\nthe most pertinent and affectionate farewell counsels, which they\r\nreceived with every expression of gratitude, veneration, and love. In\r\nhis last days and hours he evinced the most humble, trusting,\r\nchild-like spirit, willing to live as long as God was pleased to\r\ndetain him, but evidently considering it far better to depart and be\r\nwith Christ. His last words were, \"Glorious Redeemer, take my spirit.\"\r\nHe died July 27, 1820.\r\n\r\nHis wife Elisabeth, daughter of the Rev. Tristram Gilman, a lady whose\r\nfine intellectual, moral, and Christian qualities adorned every\r\nstation in which she was placed, survived him many years, and died on\r\nthe 5th of September, 1851. They had three children, one of whom,\r\nSamuel Gilman [now President Brown], is a professor in Dartmouth\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nThe degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred upon President Brown by\r\nboth Hamilton and Williams Colleges, in 1819.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of President Brown's published works: \"An\r\nAddress on Music,\" delivered before the Handel Society of Dartmouth\r\nCollege, 1809. \"The Faithful Steward:\" A Sermon delivered at the\r\nordination of Allen Greeley, 1810. \"A Sermon delivered before the\r\nMaine Missionary Society, 1814.\" \"Calvin and Calvinism;\" defended\r\nagainst certain injurious representations contained in a pamphlet\r\nentitled \"A Sketch of the Life and Doctrine of the Celebrated John\r\nCalvin;\" of which Rev. Martin Ruter claims to be the author, 1815. \"A\r\nReply to the Rev. Martin Ruter's Letter relating to Calvin and\r\nCalvinism, 1815.\" \"A Sermon delivered at Concord before the Convention\r\nof Congregational and Presbyterian Ministers of New Hampshire, 1818.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is from Prof. Charles B. Haddock, D.D.: \"My acquaintance\r\nwith the President was, for the most part, that of a pupil with his\r\nteacher; an undergraduate with the head of the college. And yet it was\r\nsomewhat more than this; for it was my happiness, during my Senior\r\nyear, to have lodgings in the same house with him, and to eat at the\r\nsame table, in the family of one of the professors, and as one of a\r\nsmall circle, all connected with college, and a good deal remarkable\r\nfor the freedom and vivacity of their conversation. After graduating,\r\nI saw him only occasionally, until the last few months of his life,\r\nwhich he passed here, near the close of my first year's residence at\r\nthe college as a teacher,--months in which the greatness of his\r\ncharacter was still more signally manifest than in any other\r\ncircumstances in which I had seen him.\r\n\r\n\"In recording my youthful impressions of so uncommon a personage, I\r\nmay, therefore, hope to be thought to speak not altogether without\r\nknowledge, though it should be with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Brown came to preside over the college at the age of less than\r\nthirty-two, and in circumstances to attract unusual attention to his\r\nadministration. It was during a violent contest of opposing parties\r\nfor the control of its affairs, and immediately after the removal of\r\nhis predecessor from office. His qualifications and his official acts\r\nwere, of course, exposed to severe scrutiny, and could command the\r\nrespect of the community at large only by approving themselves to the\r\ncandid judgment even of the adverse party. And I suppose it would be\r\nadmitted, even in New Hampshire, that no man ever commended himself to\r\ngeneral favor, I may say to general admiration, by a wiser, more\r\nprudent, or more honorable bearing, amid the greatest and most trying\r\ndifficulties. Indeed, such was his conduct of affairs, and such the\r\nnobleness of his whole character, as displayed in his intercourse with\r\nthe government of the State, with a rival institution under the public\r\nauthority, and with all classes of men, that not a few who began with\r\nzeal for the college over which he presided, came at last to act even\r\nmore from zeal for the MAN who presided over it.\r\n\r\n\"The mind of Dr. Brown was of the very highest order,--profound,\r\ncomprehensive, and discriminating. Its action was deliberate,\r\ncircumspect, and sure. He made no mistakes; he left nothing in doubt\r\nwhere certainty was possible; he never conjectured where there were\r\nmeans of knowledge; he had no obscure glimpses among his ideas of\r\ntruth and duty. Always sound and always luminous, his opinions were\r\nnever uttered without being understood, and never understood without\r\nbeing regarded. There was a dignity and weight in his judgments which\r\nseem to me not unlike what constitutes the patriarchal authority of\r\nWashington and Marshall.\r\n\r\n\"If not already a man of learning, in the larger sense of that term,\r\nit was only because the duties of the pastoral relation had so long\r\nattracted his attention to the objects of more particular interest in\r\nhis profession. Had his life been spared, however, he would have been\r\nlearned in the highest and rarest sense. His habits of study were\r\nliberal, patient, and eminently philosophical; and within the sphere\r\nwhich his inquiries covered, his knowledge was accurate and choice,\r\nand his taste faultless. The entire form of his literary character was\r\nbeautiful--strong without being dogmatic; delicate without being\r\nfastidious.\r\n\r\n\"His heart was large. Great objects alone could fill it; and it was\r\nfull of great objects. There was no littleness of thought, or purpose,\r\nor ambition, in him--nothing little. The range of his literary\r\nsympathies was as wide as the world of mind; his benevolence as\r\nuniversal as the wants of man.\r\n\r\n\"His person was commanding. Gentle in his manners, affable, courteous,\r\nhe yet, unconsciously, partly by the natural dignity of his figure,\r\nand still more by the greatness visibly impressed on his features,\r\nexacted from us all a deference, a veneration even, that seemed as\r\nnatural as it was inevitable. His very presence was a restraint upon\r\neverything like levity or frivolity, and diffused a thoughtful and\r\ncomposed, if not always grave, air about him, which, never ceasing to\r\nbe cheerful and bright, never failed to dignify the objects of pursuit\r\nand elevate the intercourse of life. A gentleman in the primitive\r\nsense of the word, he was, without seeking to be thought so, always\r\nfelt to be of a superior order of men.\r\n\r\n\"On the whole, it has been my fortune to know no man whose entire\r\ncharacter has appeared to me so near perfection, none, whom it would\r\nso satisfy me in all things to resemble.\r\n\r\n\"How much we lost in him it is now impossible to estimate, and it\r\nwould, perhaps, be useless to know. His early death extinguished great\r\nhopes. But his memory is a treasure, which even death cannot take from\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nHon. Rufus Choate writes thus: \"It happened that my whole time at\r\ncollege coincided with the period of President Brown's administration.\r\nHe was inducted into office in the autumn of 1815, my Freshman year,\r\nand he died in the summer of 1820. It is not the want, therefore, but\r\nthe throng, of recollections of him that creates any difficulty in\r\ncomplying with your request. He was still young at the time of his\r\ninauguration--not more than thirty-one--and he had passed those few\r\nyears, after having been for three of them a tutor in Dartmouth\r\nCollege, in the care of a parish in North Yarmouth, in Maine; but he\r\nhad already, in an extraordinary degree, dignity of person and\r\nsentiment; rare beauty,--almost youthful beauty, of countenance; a\r\nsweet, deep, commanding tone of voice; a grave but graceful and\r\nattractive demeanor--all the traits and all the qualities, completely\r\nripe, which make up and express weight of character; and all the\r\naddress and firmness and knowledge of youth, men, and affairs which\r\nconstitute what we call administrative talent. For that form of\r\ntalent, and for the greatness which belongs to character, he was\r\ndoubtless remarkable. He must have been distinguished for this among\r\nthe eminent. From his first appearance before the students on the day\r\nof his inauguration, when he delivered a brief and grave address in\r\nLatin, prepared we were told, the evening before, until they followed\r\nthe bier, mourning, to his untimely grave, he governed them perfectly\r\nand always, through their love and veneration; the love and veneration\r\nof the 'willing soul.' Other arts of government were, indeed, just\r\nthen, scarcely practicable. The college was in a crisis which relaxed\r\ndiscipline, and would have placed a weak instructor, or an instructor\r\nunbeloved, or loved with no more than ordinary regard, in the power of\r\nclasses which would have abused it. It was a crisis which demanded a\r\ngreat man for President, and it found such an one in him. In 1816, the\r\nLegislature of New Hampshire passed the acts which changed the Charter\r\nof the institution, abolished the old corporation of Trustees, created\r\na new one, extinguished the legal identity of the college, and\r\nreconstructed it or set up another under a different and more\r\nambitious name and a different government. The old Trustees, with\r\nPresident Brown at their head, denied the validity of these acts, and\r\nresisted their administration. A dominant political party had passed\r\nor adopted them; and thereupon a controversy arose between the college\r\nand a majority of the State; conducted in part in the courts of law of\r\nNew Hampshire, and of the Union; in part by the press; sometimes by\r\nthe students of the old institution and the new in personal collision,\r\nor the menace of personal collision, within the very gardens of the\r\nacademy; which was not terminated until the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States adjudged the acts unconstitutional and void. This\r\ndecision was pronounced in 1819; and then, and not till then, had\r\nPresident Brown peace,--a brief peace made happy by letters, by\r\nreligion, by the consciousness of a great duty performed for law, for\r\nliterature, and for the Constitution,--happy even in prospect of\r\npremature death. This contest tried him and the college with extreme\r\nand various severity. To induce students to remain in a school\r\ndisturbed and menaced; to engage and inform public sentiment, the true\r\npatron and effective founder, by showing forth that the principles of\r\na sound political morality, as well as of law, prescribed the action\r\nof the old Trustees; to confer with the counsel of the college, two of\r\nwhom--Mr. Mason and Mr. Webster--have often declared to me their\r\nadmiration of the intellectual force and practical good sense which he\r\nbrought to those conferences,--this all, while it withdrew him\r\nsomewhat from the proper studies and proper cares of his office,\r\ncreated a necessity for the display of the very rarest qualities of\r\ntemper, discretion, tact, and command, and he met it with consummate\r\nability and fortune. One of his addresses to the students in the\r\nchapel at the darkest moment of the struggle, presenting the condition\r\nand prospects of the college, and the embarrassments of all kinds\r\nwhich surrounded its instructors, and appealing to the manliness and\r\naffection and good principles of the students to help 'by whatsoever\r\nthings were honest, lovely, or of good report,' occurs to recollection\r\nas of extraordinary persuasiveness and influence.\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt that he had very eminent intellectual ability,\r\ntrue love of the beautiful in all things, and a taste trained to\r\ndiscover, enjoy, and judge it, and that his acquirements were\r\ncompetent and increasing. It was the 'keenness' of his mind of which\r\nMr. Mason always spoke to me as remarkable in any man of any\r\nprofession. He met him only in consultation as a client; but others,\r\nstudents, all nearer his age, and admitted to his fuller intimacy,\r\nmust have been struck rather with the sobriety and soundness of his\r\nthoughts, the solidity and large grasp of his understanding, and the\r\nharmonized culture of all its parts. He wrote a pure and clear English\r\nstyle, and he judged of elegant literature with a catholic and\r\nappreciative but chastised taste. The recollections of a student of\r\nthe learning of a beloved and venerated president of a college, whom\r\nhe sees only as a boy sees a man, and his testimony concerning it,\r\nwill have little value; but I know that he was esteemed an excellent\r\nGreek and Latin scholar, and our recitations of Horace, which the\r\npoverty of the college and the small number of its teachers induced\r\nhim to superintend, though we were Sophomores only, were the most\r\nagreeable and instructive exercises of the whole college classical\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\"Of studies more professional he seemed master. Locke, Stewart, with\r\nwhose liberality and tolerance and hopeful and rational philanthropy\r\nhe sympathized warmly, Butler, Edwards, and the writers on natural law\r\nand moral philosophy, he expounded with the ease and freedom of one\r\nhabitually trained and wholly equal to these larger meditations.\r\n\r\n\"His term of office was short and troubled; but the historian of the\r\ncollege will record of his administration a two-fold honor; first,\r\nthat it was marked by a noble vindication of its chartered rights; and\r\nsecond, that it was marked also by a real advancement of its learning;\r\nby collections of ampler libraries, and by displays of a riper\r\nscholarship.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS FROM 1820 TO 1828.--ADMINISTRATIONS OF PRESIDENT DANA AND\r\nPRESIDENT TYLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not an easy matter, especially in the impoverished condition of\r\nthe college, to find a worthy successor of President Brown.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of President Brown's illness, and at different\r\nperiods after his death, Professor Ebenezer Adams, a gentleman of\r\ndecided and energetic character, and (in years) the senior professor\r\nin the college, was acting president.\r\n\r\nRev. Daniel Dana of Newburyport, Massachusetts, was elected the fourth\r\npresident of the college in August, 1820.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the next few pages is from the \"Life of President\r\nDana,\" published in 1866.\r\n\r\nThe following is one of many letters addressed to him, urging his\r\nacceptance of the presidency:\r\n\r\n    \"Dartmouth College, Sept. 7, 1820.\r\n\r\n\"Rev. and dear Sir:--Not having heard from any of our friends what is\r\nthe prospect in regard to your acceptance of the appointment made by\r\nour Trustees, I cannot help troubling you with a line.\r\n\r\n\"I need not tell you that our solicitude would rise to extreme\r\ndistress were we seriously apprehensive that you might decide in the\r\nnegative. Oh, sir, remember the desolations of Zion here, and have\r\ncompassion. The friends of the college look to you, and to you only,\r\nto repair the waste places. When you know that the voice of the\r\nTrustees conspires with that of the clergy and of the public at large,\r\nand when this same voice is echoed from the tomb of our late beloved\r\nand much lamented President Brown, can you hesitate? That good man, in\r\nhis last days, with almost the confidence and ardor of prophecy,\r\ndeclared his belief in the future prosperity and usefulness of\r\nDartmouth College. You have, I hope, been informed of the strong\r\nmanner in which he, last autumn, expressed himself in relation to a\r\nsuccessor; and of the same decided and unwavering opinion which came\r\nfrom his mouth a few days before his death. 'I have,' said he, 'but\r\none candidate, and that is Dr. Dana. Whom do they talk of for a\r\nsuccessor? My opinion is exactly the same as when I conversed with you\r\nlast fall.'\r\n\r\n\"I do pray, my dear sir, that Divine Providence may not permit you to\r\nfail of coming.\r\n\r\n\"I should be grieved if, on making the trial, you should not find\r\nyourself pleasantly situated here. I verily believe that you would\r\nfind a disposition on the part of the people of the village, including\r\nall the college Faculty, to render your situation comfortable and\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\n\"We shall watch every mail and ask every friend, till we learn the\r\ndecision, or rather what we may expect the decision to be.\r\n\r\n    With great respect,\r\n    \"Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    \"R. D. M.\"[34]\r\n\r\n      [34] Professor R. D. Mussey.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat is here stated as to President Brown, was also true of President\r\nAppleton of Bowdoin College. Each had desired that Dr. Dana should be\r\nhis successor. No stronger proof could be given of the confidence felt\r\nin him, than these concurrent last wishes of two such men. Each had\r\nbrought to the office he held not merely intellectual preëminence, but\r\na dignity and elevation of character, and a singleness of purpose,\r\nrarely equaled; and to each the future welfare of the institution over\r\nwhich he presided was an object of the deepest solicitude.\r\n\r\nDr. Dana's letter of acceptance is as follows:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"To the Rev. and Honorable Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College,\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen:--I have received, with deep sensibility, not unmingled\r\nwith surprise, the notice of the appointment with which you have\r\nhonored me, to the presidency of the institution under your care.\r\n\r\n\"The consideration of a subject of such magnitude has been attended\r\nwith no small degree of perplexity and distress.\r\n\r\n\"The character and objects of Dartmouth College; its intimate\r\nconnection with the great interests of the Church and of human\r\nsociety; the important services it has long rendered to both; its\r\nrecent arduous struggle for existence, with the attending\r\nembarrassments, and auspicious issue; the claims it possesses on the\r\ncommunity, and especially on its own sons; the unanimity of your\r\nsuffrages in the present case; these with other affecting\r\ncircumstances have been carefully considered, and I trust duly\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\n\"Considerations of a different kind have likewise presented. My long\r\nand intimate connection with a most beloved and affectionate people--a\r\nconnection rendered interesting not only by its duties and delights\r\nbut by its very solicitudes and afflictions--a diffidence of my powers\r\nto meet the expectations of the Trustees, and the demands of the\r\ncollege; the exchange, at my age, of a sphere whose duties, though\r\narduous and exhausting, are yet familiar, for another in which new\r\nduties, new responsibilities, new anxieties arise; in which likewise\r\nsuccess is uncertain, and failure would be distressing--these\r\nconsiderations, with a variety of others scarcely possible to be\r\ndetailed have at times come over me with an almost appalling\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n\"In these circumstances I have not dared trust my feelings, nor even\r\nmy judgment, with the decision of the case.\r\n\r\n\"One resource remained,--to seek advice through the regular\r\necclesiastical channel--and this with a full determination to consider\r\nthe judgment of the presbytery as the most intelligible expression\r\nwhich I could hope to obtain of the mind and will of Heaven,\r\nrespecting my duty; to this measure my church and people gave their\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\n\"The presbytery having determined, by nearly a unanimous vote, in\r\nfavor of the dissolution of my pastoral relation, and my acceptance of\r\nthe appointment, my duty is of course decided. I now, therefore,\r\ndeclare my compliance with your invitation.\r\n\r\n\"I devote the residue of my life to the interests of the institution\r\ncommitted to your care.\r\n\r\n\"This I do with deep solicitude, yet not without an animating hope\r\nthat He whose prerogative and glory it is to operate important effects\r\nby feeble instruments, may be pleased, even through me, to give a\r\nblessing to a seminary which has so signally enjoyed His protecting\r\nand fostering care.\r\n\r\n\"Providence permitting, I shall be at Hanover on the fourth Wednesday\r\nof the present month, with a view to attend the solemnities of\r\ninauguration. It will then be necessary, considering the advanced\r\nseason, and other circumstances, for me to return without delay, that\r\nI may arrange my affairs and remove my family.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, my resolution on this great subject has been taken in the\r\nfull confidence of experiencing, in all future time, what I shall so\r\nmuch need, your liberal candor, and your cordial, energetic support.\r\nSuffer me, in addition, to request, in my behalf, your devout\r\nsupplications to Him who is the Father of Lights and the munificent\r\nbestower of every blessing.\r\n\r\n\"I am, gentlemen, with every sentiment of esteem and respect,\r\n\r\n    \"Your devoted friend and servant,\r\n    \"Daniel Dana.\r\n\r\n    \"Newburyport, Oct. 3, 1820.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Allusion is made in his farewell sermon at Newburyport, to his\r\n'recently impaired health.' This was premonitory. Scarcely had he\r\nremoved his family to Hanover, and entered on his new duties, before\r\nthe crisis came to which, doubtless, the wasting cares and anxieties\r\nof preceding years and the recent severe pressure upon his\r\nsensibilities, had been silently but inevitably tending. His health\r\ngave way, and great depression of spirits accompanied his bodily\r\nlanguor. He took more than one long journey in the vain effort to\r\nrecruit his energies. He writes to a friend of being 'in a state of\r\ngreat and very uncommon debility, undoubtedly to be attributed to the\r\nprotracted operation of distressing causes, both on mind and frame.'\r\nHe also states, that, whilst absent from Hanover in accordance with\r\nthe advice of his physician, he still hoped to be able, after his\r\nstrength was recruited, to accomplish something in the matter of\r\nsoliciting aid to the funds of the college; a work which, however\r\nuncongenial to his tastes, he found would necessarily be devolved on\r\nits president.\r\n\r\n\"The winter months passed by, and there was still little or no\r\nimprovement in his health. When it became known that he was agitating\r\nthe question of resigning his office, many urgent requests were made\r\nto him not to decide hastily. He delayed only till April, and then\r\ncalled a meeting of the Trustees, to be held early in May, for the\r\npurpose of receiving and acting upon his resignation of his office. He\r\nwished it to be considered as 'absolute and final.' The notification\r\nto a member of the Board with whom he was specially intimate, was\r\naccompanied by a letter in which he says:\r\n\r\n\"'You will naturally conclude that the resolution which I have taken\r\nhas cost me many a struggle, and much severe distress. This is the\r\nfact. The last seven months have been with me a scene of suffering\r\nindeed. I have fondly hoped that repeated journeyings would give me\r\nrelief. But their effect has been only partial and temporary. Such is\r\nmy prostration at this moment, that the duties of my office, and not\r\nless its cares and its responsibilities, seem a burden quite beyond my\r\npower of bearing. Had it pleased God to make me an instrument of\r\nimportant good to the college, I should have esteemed myself\r\nprivileged indeed; but this privilege, though denied to me, awaits, I\r\nconfidently hope, some more favored instrument of the Divine\r\nbenevolence. I earnestly pray, that, in what pertains to this great\r\nconcern, the Trustees may be favored with much heavenly wisdom and\r\ndirection.'\r\n\r\n\"He now took a long journey to Ohio, visiting at Athens the brother\r\nwho had been the companion of his early years. Under these favorable\r\ninfluences, his health began more decidedly to improve. At their\r\nmeeting, July 4, the Trustees of the college, by unanimous resolution,\r\nrequested him to withdraw his resignation; but he declined to do so,\r\nthough 'gratefully acknowledging the kindness expressed in their\r\ncommunication.'\r\n\r\n\"Many years after these events, the Rev. Dr. Lord, so long and so\r\nhonorably the president of Dartmouth College, thus referred to Dr.\r\nDana's connection with the institution:\r\n\r\n\"'He was chosen president for his well-known excellence as a scholar\r\nand theologian, and his extraordinary ministerial qualifications. He\r\nwas honored the country over, in these respects. It was not doubted\r\nthat he would be equally honorable as president of the college, should\r\nhis health endure.\r\n\r\n\"'That he would have been, had he been able to retain his place,\r\neverybody well understood, as well from his auspicious beginning, as\r\nhis distinguished qualities. He made a deep impression upon the\r\ncollege during the short period of his actual service.\r\n\r\n\"'But his sensitive nature had received a great shock in the breaking\r\nup of his many and most endearing relations at Newburyport and the\r\ncountry around. He began here with health seriously impaired, and in\r\ngreat depression of spirit. The change of scene, of society, labor,\r\nand responsibility, was too much for his disordered frame. He sought\r\nrelief by travel. But he gained little or nothing, and was driven to\r\nthe conclusion that his life could probably be saved only by\r\nresignation. He could not consent to make such an office as he held a\r\nsinecure, or to see the college labor through its severe adversities\r\nwithout greater vigor of administration than his infirmities admitted.\r\nWith great conscientiousness and magnanimity, he chose to put himself\r\nat a seeming disadvantage, rather than to risk the interests of the\r\ncollege upon what he judged to be the doubtful chances of his\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n\"'He left with the profound respect and sincere regret of the Trustees\r\nand Faculty. Their confidence in him was unshaken; and they never\r\ndoubted, that, had he been more favorable to himself, and borne his\r\nnew burdens with less solicitude, till he could regain his health, he\r\nwould have been as distinguished here as elsewhere, and raised the\r\ncollege to a corresponding usefulness and dignity.\r\n\r\n\"'Most men judge superficially and unwisely in such cases. So far as I\r\nknow, the most competent judges of Dr. Dana's relations to Dartmouth\r\nsee nothing that does not redound to his honor. It is understood that\r\nhe accepted the presidency with great reluctance, on account of his\r\nother responsibilities and attachments, and with distrust of his\r\nphysical ability to perform its duties; that, while he performed them,\r\nit was with characteristic ability and effect; and that, when his best\r\nefforts to regain his health failed, and he saw reason to fear, that,\r\neven if his life should not be a sacrifice, his increasing infirmities\r\nwould be to the disadvantage of a struggling institution, he\r\ngenerously, and entirely of his own accord, resigned. To my\r\napprehension, all this is significant of great moral strength under\r\nthe pressure of bodily disease, and a memorable instance of that\r\nChristian heroism for which he has always been remarkable. \"_Maluit\r\nesse quam videri bonus._\"'\"\r\n\r\nThe subsequent labors of President Dana in the ministry, and the high\r\nesteem of all who best knew him till his death, August 26, 1859, are\r\nmatters of permanent record. His first wife, Mrs. Elizabeth (Coombs)\r\nDana, and the second, Mrs. Sarah (Emery) Dana, had died previous to\r\nhis residence at Hanover.\r\n\r\nPresident Dana's brief but earnest labors for the college having\r\nclosed in 1821, the fifth president was Rev. Bennet Tyler, who was\r\ncalled from a pastorate in Southbury, Conn.\r\n\r\nWe quote in substance some passages relating to this subject from his\r\n\"Memoir,\" by his son-in-law, Rev. Nahum Gale, D.D.\r\n\r\n\"Early in 1822, Mr. Tyler was appointed president of Dartmouth\r\nCollege. It was to him a mystery why he should be selected for that\r\nstation. Located in a retired country parish, he had been devoted to\r\nthe duties of the ministry, and had paid little attention to science\r\nor literature. He was strongly attached to his people and his home,\r\nfor there had arisen, as 'olive plants,' around his table, three sons\r\nand four daughters.\r\n\r\n\"But he was recommended to the Trustees of Dartmouth by Dr. Porter, of\r\nAndover, and others, in whose judgment he had great confidence; his\r\nbrethren around him in the ministry, and the consociation with which\r\nhe was connected, believed it to be his duty to accept the\r\nappointment. Accordingly, he broke away from an endeared people, was\r\ninaugurated at Dartmouth in March, and entered upon the duties of his\r\noffice the following June. In the autumn of 1822, the newly-elected\r\npresident was honored by the degree of D.D., from Middlebury College.\r\nOf his connection with Dartmouth College, Dr. Tyler has left the\r\nfollowing record:\r\n\r\n\"'I was among strangers, and engaged in duties to which I was\r\nunaccustomed. But I found myself surrounded by able professors, who\r\ntreated me with great kindness, and rendered me all the assistance in\r\ntheir power. My situation was much more pleasant than I anticipated;\r\nand through the assistance of a gracious Providence, I was enabled to\r\ndischarge the duties which devolved upon me with acceptance. I have\r\nnever had any reason to doubt that I was in the path of duty when I\r\naccepted the appointment. My labor in the service of the college, I\r\nhumbly trust, was not altogether in vain. I had the satisfaction to\r\nknow that I left it in a more prosperous condition than I found it. It\r\nwas no part of my duty, as president of the college, to preach on the\r\nSabbath; but the health of the professor of Divinity failing soon\r\nafter my inauguration, I found it necessary to supply his place; and\r\nduring the whole period of my presidency I preached a considerable\r\npart of the time. In the year 1826, there was a very interesting\r\nrevival of religion, both among the students and the inhabitants of\r\nthe village, which will be remembered by not a few, while \"immortality\r\nendures.\"\r\n\r\n\"'I was connected with the college six years; and, although I never\r\nfelt so much at home as in the duties of the ministry, still I had no\r\nserious thoughts of relinquishing my station, till, very unexpectedly,\r\nI received a call from the Second Church in Portland. When I received\r\nthis call, I felt a new desire for the duties and joys of the pastoral\r\nlife, and believing I could resign my office without putting in\r\njeopardy the interests of the college, I concluded to do so. I parted\r\nwith the Trustees, Faculty, and students, with feelings of great\r\ncordiality, and I had reason to believe that the feelings were\r\nreciprocated.'\r\n\r\n\"The following letter from the venerable Professor Shurtleff,\r\naddressed to Rev. John E. Tyler, will give the impressions of one\r\nassociated with Dr. Tyler during his presidency at Hanover.\r\n\r\n    \"Hanover, N. H., September 22, 1858.\r\n\r\n\"Reverend and very dear Friend: Permit me thus to address you; for I\r\ncan truly say that I regarded you with much interest and affection\r\nduring the whole time of your residence here, and I may also add that\r\nyour venerated parents had no friends in Hanover more sincere and\r\nardent than Mrs. Shurtleff and myself.\r\n\r\n\"When your dear father was appointed president of Dartmouth College,\r\nhe had been little heard of in New Hampshire. His first appearance,\r\nhowever, was very prepossessing, and his preaching was much admired.\r\nHis popularity was so general in this region, that a gentleman of a\r\nneighboring town inquired, 'Why, if he is such a man as they say, was\r\nhe not heard of before?' To which I replied, if you will allow me to\r\nquote my own words, that 'the Lord had kept him concealed in an\r\nobscure parish for a blessing to our college.' The impression which\r\nhis first appearance made was not lowered by further acquaintance. I\r\ndo not recollect hearing a complaint of him from any member of the\r\ncollege. All his intercourse with them was tempered with the utmost\r\nkindness, while he was punctual and faithful in every official duty. I\r\nthink he originated the project of raising, by subscription, a fund of\r\nten thousand dollars for the aid of indigent students seeking an\r\neducation for the ministry.\r\n\r\n\"This object he not only conceived, but completed by his own personal\r\nefforts. For this, as well as for other services, he should be\r\ngratefully remembered by the college, by the church, and by the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\"But the religious influence of Dr. Tyler, while president of\r\nDartmouth, will never be forgotten. In the summer of 1825, the\r\nprofessor of Divinity was arrested by a severe and protracted\r\naffection of the lungs. The president at once took the services of the\r\nsanctuary; and the following spring term was rendered memorable by a\r\nrevival of religion, which issued in adding to the Lord many students\r\nand inhabitants of the village.\r\n\r\n\"During his residence here we had a class of students in their\r\nprofessional studies, who wished to enter the ministry earlier than\r\nthey could by entering a public seminary. We met with them once in a\r\nweek, heard their dissertations on subjects that had been assigned,\r\nand each of us spoke on the performances, and on the subjects. The\r\nyoung gentlemen were all licensed to preach after about two years, and\r\nbecame useful ministers of the gospel. By these exercises, as well as\r\nby long intimacy, I was convinced that Dr. Tyler had peculiarly clear\r\nand discriminating views of the doctrines of the gospel, and an\r\nuncommon facility in explaining and defending them; and I have often\r\nremarked in years past, that with the exception of my friend, Dr.\r\nWoods, of Andover, I would sooner recommend him to young men as a\r\nteacher of Theology than any other clergyman in the circle of my\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n\"With many pleasing reminiscences, I remain your friend and brother in\r\nthe gospel,\r\n\r\n    Roswell Shurtleff.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Asa D. Smith writes thus:\r\n\r\n    \"New York, December 14, 1858.\r\n    \"Rev. J. E. Tyler,--\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sir: You ask for my recollections of your honored father, as\r\npresident of my Alma Mater. I regret that I can furnish but little in\r\nthat relation. He remained at the head of the institution some two\r\nyears only after I was matriculated.\r\n\r\n\"The two lower classes had, of course, much less intercourse with him\r\nthan those more advanced. You could doubtless obtain more ample\r\ninformation from those who were Seniors under him, and who had more\r\nlargely the benefit of his instruction. Such impressions as I have,\r\nhowever, I am happy to give.\r\n\r\n\"It was when a member of Kimball Union Academy, in preparation for\r\ncollege, if I mistake not, that I first set eyes on his commanding\r\nform, and listened to the impressive tones of his voice. That academy,\r\nas you know, is about a dozen miles from Hanover. Not long before the\r\ngraduation of one of its classes, he visited the place, and preached\r\non the Sabbath. It is not impossible that his visit had some reference\r\nto the fact that there were among us so many candidates for college\r\nlife. It was, at all events, well for Dartmouth that he came. Judging\r\nfrom the influence on my mind, I cannot doubt that not a few were the\r\nmore inclined, for what they saw of him, to connect themselves with\r\nthe institution over which he presided.\r\n\r\n\"It was the year before I entered college, I think, that is, in\r\n1825-26, that Dartmouth was blessed with one of the most remarkable\r\nrevivals of religion it has ever enjoyed. Transformations of character\r\nwere wrought then which have borne the test of decades of years. Some\r\nof the finest minds in college were brought under the power of the\r\ngospel--minds that have since shone as bright lights in the world.\r\n\r\n\"When I entered the college, I found him dignified, yet affable and\r\nfatherly in his bearing. His preaching then, as we often heard him in\r\nthe village church, was marked by the same simplicity, clearness, and\r\nlogical force, the same scripturalness, fullness of doctrine, and\r\nevangelical earnestness, that characterized his subsequent\r\nministrations. He preached not to the fancy, but to the conscience and\r\nthe heart. He confined not himself to hortatory appeals, nor did he,\r\nin any wise, skim over the surface of things; but, as both my notes\r\nand recollections of his college sermons assure me, he was apt to\r\nhandle, and that vigorously, the high topics of theology. He gave us\r\nnot milk alone, but strong meat. Yet have I seldom known a man so\r\nremarkable for making an abstruse subject plain to every hearer.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRev. George Punchard, of Boston, and Rev. Nathaniel Folsom, D.D.,\r\nprofessor in Meadville College, Pa., have furnished their\r\nrecollections respecting the revival in Dartmouth College, in the year\r\n1826, to which allusion is made by Dr. Smith.\r\n\r\nThe former says:\r\n\r\n    \"Boston, February 16, 1859.\r\n\r\n    \"Rev. John E. Tyler,--\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sir: Your venerable father was president of Dartmouth College\r\nduring my whole collegiate course--from 1822 to 1826. My earliest\r\nrecollections of him are those only which a thoughtless boy of sixteen\r\nwould be likely to have of a grave and reverend divine, and are of\r\nlittle value.\r\n\r\n\"It was not until near the close of my college life that I began\r\nreally to know him. At that time the college was visited by a revival\r\nof religion of uncommon power, and my reverend president suddenly\r\nawoke (at least to my view) in an entirely new character.\r\n\r\n\"He came to the students with a power and unction which were quite\r\nirresistible, and manifested a depth of religious feeling for us which\r\nmade us at once love him and admire him. He seemed to have found his\r\nappropriate sphere of labor; to have got into an atmosphere which\r\nfilled his soul and body with life and energy; to have work to do\r\nwhich was congenial, which he loved, and which he knew how to do as\r\nfew men did. He was at once a son of thunder and a son of consolation.\r\nHis discourses, which had always been able and instructive, and\r\ncharacterized by simplicity of arrangement and neatness and purity of\r\nstyle, had now the additional attraction of an animated and energetic\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\n\"And yet, perhaps, the conference room and the prayer-meeting were the\r\nplaces in which, at that time, Dr. Tyler specially excelled. He was\r\nnaturally rather heavy and lethargic in his manner of speaking, and it\r\nrequired a good deal to excite and warm him thoroughly. But the scenes\r\nand duties incident to a powerful revival of religion, in which a\r\nhundred or more young men were more or less interested, supplied the\r\nnecessary stimulus, and the strong man was fully waked up, and in his\r\nextemporaneous addresses particularly, poured out streams of Christian\r\neloquence which he seldom equaled in his more carefully prepared\r\npublic discourses, and which few men whom I have ever heard, could\r\nexcel or equal.\r\n\r\n\"His labors, however, were not confined to the pulpit and the\r\nconference meeting. He cheerfully and heartily did the work of a\r\npastor among the students, going from room to room, instructing and\r\nexhorting his beloved pupils, and praying with them. He was among us,\r\nnot as the grave and dignified head of the college, but rather as a\r\nloving, anxious father, seeking to instruct and save his children; or,\r\nas an elder brother, tenderly solicitous for our spiritual welfare. He\r\nwas gentle among us, even as a nurse cherisheth her children. And God,\r\nI verily believe, gave him spiritual children from among our number,\r\nas the reward of his fidelity; children who never ceased to love him\r\nwhile he lived, and who will cherish his memory with gratitude to\r\ntheir dying hours.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Folsom says:\r\n\r\n\"Dartmouth College was fortunate in getting Mr. Tyler to stand in the\r\nline of its excellent presidents. Each of them was different from the\r\nrest in special qualifications, in work performed, in kind and force\r\nof influence exerted; but each did what made his administration an\r\nimportant period in the history of the college, and extended its fame\r\nand usefulness. Dr. Tyler was inferior to none of them in the depth\r\nand extent to which he affected the character of the students for\r\ngood, and through them, wherever the Divine Providence called them to\r\nlive and labor, promoted the welfare of the country; the enlightenment\r\nand moral activity, and power, and happiness of the people.\r\n\r\n\"His splendid physique, in which he surpassed everybody in the region;\r\nhis noble stature and well-proportioned form; his head finely poised,\r\nand around it a halo of parental benignity, its perpetual and unfading\r\ncrown; these struck every one at first sight, and prepossessed all in\r\nhis favor. I know of none with whom to compare him in these respects\r\nexcept Ezekiel Webster. In his whole spirit and mien, in look and word\r\nand action, he was a father, and his whole administration was parental\r\nin the best sense of the word. This benignity, as we learn from his\r\n'Memoir,' marked his subsequent career as president of the East\r\nWindsor Theological School. His biographer, taking notice of the fact\r\nthat 'the perversities of human nature make their appearance in such\r\ninstitutions as well as elsewhere,' observes that 'the strong\r\naffections of the father in him occasionally swayed the firmness of\r\nthe tutor and governor, and rendered him indulgent and yielding in\r\ncases where there was call for the peremptory and authoritative.' In\r\nthe first two years of our college life, from the fall of 1824 to the\r\nspring of 1826, two or three instances of wrongdoing passed unnoticed\r\nwhich perhaps deserved such a mode of treatment. There were, moreover,\r\nit is to be confessed, irregularities and bad practices among students\r\nin all the classes at that period, but they were exceptional, so far\r\nas my knowledge of them extended, and would have required a system of\r\nespionage to detect them, or informers from the guilty ones\r\nthemselves. Dartmouth however, at its worst, in that period, was not\r\none whit behind any other college in New England, in its general tone\r\nof morals, in observance of law, in habits of study and in scholarly\r\nattainments. There were not a few whose sense of honor was very high,\r\nand as they were popular and influential, they in some degree\r\nnecessarily gave tone to others. Nay, surrounded by such an atmosphere\r\nof benignity--of which every student was more or less conscious,\r\nfeeling it not only in the presence of the president, but also more or\r\nless in our connection with every other officer of the college without\r\nexception--I think there was far less tendency to excess, far less of\r\nthe irritation of inclination against prohibition of law; and\r\nassuredly there was never apparent a disposition to rebel from hope of\r\nimpunity through the recognized forbearance of our teachers.\r\n\r\n\"In the spring of the year 1828, a higher influence was brought to\r\nbear, reinforcing and extending the moral element throughout the\r\ncollege; recovering not a few from irregularities of conduct and waste\r\nof talent; awakening the religious nature; giving birth to new\r\nmotives, and leading many to noble and useful lives. From that period\r\nuntil our class graduated in 1828, I cannot recall an act deserving\r\nspecial even animadversion, nor remember an instance of a student\r\nobnoxious to discipline for indolent of other censurable habits. But I\r\nremember several young men of exemplary deportment and distinguished\r\nability, among them Salmon P. Chase, who though not publicly regarded\r\nas 'subjects of the work,' were greatly affected, their future being\r\nlargely determined by it. They all subsequently exhibited deep moral\r\nand religious purpose, and were foremost in philanthropic action.\r\nWithout the preaching of Dr. Tyler as its great instrument, and\r\nwithout such a man presiding over it, and guiding it, there is no\r\nreason to suppose that the revival would have taken place, or would\r\nhave been so extensive and powerful.\r\n\r\n\"It is by looking at Dr. Tyler from every point of view that we alone\r\ncan form a just estimate of his qualities. His greatest power was\r\nthat of preacher, and he was most at home in this office. He did not\r\nseek it, but it providentially came to him in the illness of Professor\r\nShurtleff, the professor of Theology, and he retired from it when in\r\nthe year 1827, Professor George Howe succeeded Professor Shurtleff. He\r\nhad risen in it to the very height of the duty he attempted to\r\ndischarge, and was majestic in it. His mode of delivery and gesture\r\nwere beyond criticism, and at times sublime. I never heard a student\r\nspeak of him in this capacity without the highest praise; and his\r\npower ended not simply in producing admiration, but in influencing his\r\nhearers to duty. The great object aimed at in his preaching was to\r\ninduce his hearers to be willing, unconditionally, to do and submit to\r\nthe revealed Divine will. He who succeeds in persuading his fellow-men\r\nto faithfully and perseveringly try to do this, does the highest\r\nChristian work, and most for the benefit of man. No one who has sat in\r\nthe presidential chair of Dartmouth, or of any other college, during\r\nan equal length of time, has done more in this direction than Bennet\r\nTyler.\"\r\n\r\nThe librarian says:\r\n\r\n\"In 1819, Isaiah Thomas of Worcester, Massachusetts, presented the\r\ncollege library 470 volumes, which were perhaps an equivalent for the\r\nbooks recently lost, as Professor Haddock makes the statement that\r\nthere were probably no more books in 1820 than in 1815. In 1820 the\r\nTrustees appropriated $400. The three libraries at this time must have\r\nnumbered not far from 8,000 volumes. In 1826, the 'Social Friends'\r\nobtained a Charter, and one was granted to the United Fraternity'\r\nduring the following year. These Charters gave the societies the right\r\nto hold property, and transact business, and made necessary the\r\nconsent of a majority of the existing members in order to dispose of\r\nthe libraries. The society libraries had been increasing more rapidly\r\nthan the college library, and at this time they had reached it in size\r\nas well as exceeded it in practical value and in circulation. It is\r\nquite noticeable that these three libraries for the twenty-five years\r\nfollowing were kept so nearly equal, by additions and losses, that at\r\nno time the number of books actually upon their shelves differed by\r\nmore than a few hundred.\r\n\r\n\"The work and influence of the societies was neither small nor to be\r\nlightly estimated, and in that work the libraries had no small share.\r\nProfessor Crosby, in speaking of the college life of the class of\r\n1827, says: 'The college library was small, and had been so collected\r\nthat it contained few books which either the instructors or students\r\nwished to read. The chief dependence of the latter was upon the\r\nsociety libraries, in which they took much pride, and to the increase\r\nof which they contributed with so great liberality in proportion to\r\ntheir means. During the first years of our course, the library of the\r\n\"United Fraternity\" occupied a place in the north entry of the\r\ncollege, corresponding to that of the \"Social Friends\" library in the\r\nsouth entry. The libraries were open only on Wednesdays and Saturdays\r\nfrom 1 to 2 P. M., for the delivery and return of books, and the\r\nstudents at these times gathered around the barred entrances to be\r\nwaited on in turn by the librarians and their assistants. The rooms\r\nwere so small that only three or four others were admitted at a time\r\nwithin the bar for the examination of the books upon the shelves. The\r\nopening of the philological room and of a reading-room about the same\r\ntime by the members of the \"Fraternity\" led to the great enlargement\r\nof the library rooms, and great increase of library advantages, which\r\ntook place in the latter part of our course. The ample rooms were now\r\nopened daily, instead of twice a week, for the delivery and return of\r\nbooks.'\r\n\r\n\"The college library is spoken of as, at that time, being open once in\r\ntwo weeks, and occupying a narrow room on the second floor of the\r\ncollege.\"\r\n\r\nThe marked advance in the course of study and general advantages of\r\ncollege life, during this period, are too well known to many living\r\nreaders to require especial notice in this connection. The leading\r\nfacts will be developed upon succeeding pages.\r\n\r\nThe following paragraphs from a member of Dr. Tyler's family are\r\nworthy of perusal.\r\n\r\n\"My first recollections of importance regarding Dartmouth College were\r\nmy father's great concern for its financial interests. There was great\r\nneed of money at this time for new buildings and scientific apparatus,\r\nand no one was found willing to assume the responsibility of\r\nsoliciting funds except President Tyler, who in his vacations\r\nundertook the matter, and was eminently successful in the work. When\r\nhe first started upon his mission he called upon the late Hon. Isaac\r\nHill, at that time editor of the New Hampshire 'Patriot,' which paper\r\nhad been, as some thought, opposed to the interests of the college.\r\nThis gentleman had attended a Commencement at Dartmouth, and had an\r\ninterview with the new president, and being pleased, had spoken highly\r\nof the college and its president in his paper. This emboldened\r\nPresident Tyler to ask Mr. Hill to head the list of subscribers to the\r\ncollege, and to his surprise he did so, pledging himself for one\r\nhundred dollars. Mr. Hill's signature was worth many thousands of\r\ndollars to the college.\r\n\r\n\"During one of his winter vacations, President Tyler started with his\r\nown horse and sleigh on his mission, going through the State of\r\nVermont into New York. He returned after six weeks' earnest and\r\narduous labor, having been very successful in his mission.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Tyler's invaluable services to the church were continued, in\r\nvarious spheres, till his death May 14, 1858, his wife, Mrs. Esther\r\n(Stone) Tyler, surviving him only one week.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nINAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT LORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. Nathan Lord, D.D., of Amherst, New Hampshire, was elected the\r\nsixth president of the college. We insert entire his inaugural\r\naddress, delivered October 29, 1828.\r\n\r\n\"The revival of learning, like that of religion, originally effected\r\nthrough the instrumentality of the press, though long hindered by the\r\nsuccessive political convulsions and changes of the world, is now\r\nevidently in the course of rapid advancement, and is producing a deep\r\nand wide impression upon the mass of civilized society. It is\r\npervading all classes, and affecting all interests. Its influence\r\npenetrates every public and private institution, and is exciting the\r\nbest energies of the human mind, both to the invention of new methods\r\nof intellectual cultivation and the application of knowledge to the\r\npractical purposes of life. Fostered by the spirit of freedom, which\r\ngoes before to disenthral the mind from that state of servitude in\r\nwhich its powers had been made to minister to ignorant and wayward\r\nambition, or still more cramping and perverting superstition, it\r\npromises to gain an universal ascendancy, and to render all that\r\ninfluence which had been arrayed against it, henceforth subservient\r\nonly to its triumphs.\r\n\r\n\"But it is characteristic of the human mind, when set at liberty from\r\nancient prejudices, and permitted to range in search of expected good,\r\nto become extreme in its calculations and projects of improvement, and\r\nto distract itself amidst the variety of its experiments. And more\r\nespecially when its enterprises are favored by the encouragement of\r\nwealth, and sustained by the indiscriminate approval of the multitude.\r\nIt is then, that overlooking the maxims of sound philosophy, and\r\ndisregarding the safe lessons of experience, it is beguiled into the\r\nadoption of untried theories, and wastes its strength in the\r\nprosecution of plans, which are found at length to accord neither with\r\nthe constitution of our nature nor with the approved usages of\r\nsociety. I will not say, that this is a great evil in comparison with\r\nthat state of mental vassalage and inaction in which nothing is\r\nattempted, nor even conceived, for the true interests of mankind. For,\r\nthe mind unfettered, will ordinarily be corrected of its mistakes and\r\nbrought back from its wanderings, when truth is the object of its\r\naspirations, and happiness is the prize only of successful effort. But\r\nwe may learn from this infirmity of our nature, to be cautious in our\r\nestimates of the good before us, and to use that moderation in our\r\nendeavors which will leave us nothing to regret, when their end shall\r\nhave been attained.\r\n\r\n\"It will scarcely be doubted that the impulse which society has\r\nreceived, particularly since the commencement of the passing century,\r\nand which has evidently been connected with the growth of freedom in\r\nthis country, has been attended with many of these excesses, and not\r\nthe least probably in the department of education. Numerous\r\nadventurers have set forth upon this field, with different pretensions\r\nindeed, and unequal advantages, but all large in their expectations,\r\nand confident of success. They have seemed to themselves almost to\r\nrealize the ideal good, to annihilate the space between barbarism and\r\nrefinement, to find in relation to intellectual attainment what\r\nexperimental philosophy had sought in vain, the mysterious agent which\r\nshould transmute the baser metals into gold.\r\n\r\n\"Without denying at all the actual advance of learning, or disparaging\r\nthe improvements which are taking place in the arrangements and\r\nadministration both of public and private seminaries, we cannot be so\r\nfond (_absit invidia verbo_) as to accredit all the inventions of this\r\nrestless age. We cannot suppose that paths so various, which have been\r\nstruck out in the heat of competition, and systems based on principles\r\nand conducted by methods so frequently differing from each other, will\r\nall conduce to the purposes for which they are intended, except as\r\nthey may excite more general attention to the interests of education,\r\nand furnish materials of which wisdom and experience shall at length\r\navail themselves, to perfect truer and more practicable systems,\r\nsuited to the intellectual and moral nature of man, and to the various\r\nrelations and interests of life. In this view, it is evident that the\r\nconduct of public literary institutions, at the present time, is\r\nattended with no trivial embarrassments. That expansion of the public\r\nmind and progress of society, which necessarily take place in a\r\ncountry favored with advantages of elementary instruction and general\r\ninformation, will always be creating just demands upon the higher\r\nseats of learning, which will task all their energies, and bring into\r\nrequisition all their resources. The mass of the community, becoming\r\nmore enlightened, will call for proportionally higher qualifications\r\nin those who are sent out to preside over the public interests, and\r\ntheir progress in influence will produce a yet more powerful reaction.\r\nBut to meet these demands amidst the conflicting sectional interests\r\nand fluctuations of public feeling, which are usually attendant upon a\r\nstate of freedom, to discriminate rightly between the diverse systems\r\nof instruction and discipline, which are set forth with such frequency\r\nand such earnestness of commendation; to keep so near the public\r\nsentiment as not to lose the confidence of the community, and yet not\r\nto follow it so implicitly as to sacrifice the more desirable good of\r\nself-approbation; this is a labor which can be estimated by those only\r\nwho have had the trial of sustaining it. Institutions that have become\r\nvenerable by age, powerful in resources and patronage, may go forward\r\nto introduce, not only accredited improvements but doubtful changes;\r\nand may bring the systems, which either the wise have devised, or the\r\npopular voice has required, to the test of actual experiment. But\r\nfeebler institutions cannot leave the ground of general principles,\r\nwhich, however it may be safer and ultimately more subservient to\r\ntheir true interests, cannot always be easily ascertained, and\r\nfrequently fails of being approved amidst the varying circumstances,\r\nrelations, and interests of society.\r\n\r\n\"The principle which has generally obtained in regard to the colleges\r\nof this country, of making them merely introductory to a professional\r\neducation, is one too important in its connections and results to be\r\nhastily relinquished. The correspondence which usually exists between\r\nthe genius of civil governments, and the arrangement of literary\r\ninstitutions, has been very happily exemplified in our system of\r\nschools, rising in regular gradation from the primary to the\r\nprofessional, and wisely accommodated to the public convenience and\r\nnecessity. This system, whatever defects may have existed in some of\r\nits practical operations, has been found, on the whole, admirably\r\nsuited to the condition of society. Its parts having kept their fair\r\nproportions, each one performing its peculiar office, and all acting\r\nand reacting upon each other, it is out of question that the results\r\nof the whole, in the general diffusion of knowledge and elevation of\r\nthe public character, have been salutary to a degree unprecedented in\r\nthe history of the world; and its general adoption, with modifications\r\naccording to the different circumstances of society, may be\r\ncontemplated as one of the surest pledges of our national prosperity.\r\nApart from the multiplied facilities of instruction, which upon this\r\nsystem are afforded at the cheapest rate to all who would enjoy the\r\nbenefits of education, that spirit of fair and honorable competition,\r\nwhich is necessarily excited between so many kindred institutions,\r\nwould seem to insure improvements proportioned to the means which are\r\nafforded them, and prove a check upon those abuses which have usually\r\nattended establishments of more extended influence and less\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\"But it would seem important to the continued success of this system,\r\nthat its several parts should still be kept distinct and subordinate.\r\nI will not say that they may not subsist harmoniously, and be\r\nconducted usefully upon the same ground. I will not say that an\r\nuniversity, sectional or national, that shall, in its separate\r\ncolleges and halls, prepare our youth for the various departments of\r\nlife, may not consist with the spirit of our civil governments, and be\r\nguarded against the evils which have generally attended establishments\r\nso complicate, and of such numerous resort. However this may be\r\njudged, it will be found, I apprehend, the wisdom of our scattered\r\ninstitutions, to preserve their individuality, and remain true, as to\r\ntheir general regulations, to the purpose of their foundation. With\r\nrespect, particularly, to the arrangements of a college, it would seem\r\nnot less true than in regard to the efforts of an individual mind, or\r\nthe operations of a machine, that however numerous and various these\r\narrangements may be in detail, the most beneficial results cannot be\r\nexpected without unity of design. Between that kind of cultivation and\r\ndiscipline necessary as a foundation for professional eminence, and\r\nthat which is required for success in mercantile, mechanical, or\r\nagricultural occupation, there is a very natural and obvious\r\ndistinction. And not only is it desirable that they who will be\r\nsuccessful mainly as they shall be conversant with books, who require\r\nto be learned men, and they whose concern lies principally in the\r\nactive business of life, in skill or labor, should have in some\r\nrespects a different course of study, but be subjected to the\r\ninfluence of different minds, and examples, and rules, and scenes, and\r\nassociations, corresponding to the different relations which they will\r\nsustain. 'Non omnia possumus omnes,' is a proverb applicable both to\r\nteachers and to pupils, and it would forbid the supposition, that\r\nminds which act upon others for widely different purposes, should do\r\nit always with the best effect, or that they who are so acted upon,\r\nshould not sometimes suffer injury from the inadequate or ill\r\nappropriated influence that is exerted over them.\r\n\r\n\"But the evils of commingling within the walls of college, and\r\nsubjecting to the same general influence, persons or classes,\r\nrequiring a different preparatory training, would not, probably, be\r\ngreater than those which would result from an attempt to carry\r\ncollegial instruction above the simple groundwork of the professions,\r\nand to accommodate the course of study and discipline to the future\r\nintended course of life. To whatever extent improvement should be\r\ncarried in the preparatory schools, of whatever qualifications young\r\nmen should be possessed, at the usual time of admission to college,\r\ntheir term of residence here cannot reasonably be thought too long,\r\nnor their facilities too ample, for general elementary cultivation. It\r\nwere not the worst of the evil of providing for professional education\r\nat college, that the time which should be devoted to mental\r\npreparation would be lost, and young men would go forth into life\r\nunfurnished; but many minds uncertain and vacillating soon wearied\r\nwith the dry elements of one department, would presently attempt\r\nanother and a third, and disgusted, at length, with all, would resign\r\nthemselves to a stupefying indolence, or a consuming licentiousness.\r\nThe examples of other times, when the learning of universities all had\r\nrespect to the future political and ecclesiastical relations of the\r\nstudent, and these institutions became little better than panders to\r\nallied despotism and superstition, may teach us to cultivate our youth\r\nin the elements of general knowledge, and impart vigor and force and\r\nfreeness to their minds, in the course of sound fundamental study,\r\nbefore they are permitted to engage in any merely professional\r\nacquisitions; to practice them well on the broad threshold of science,\r\nbefore they are exposed to be blasted or bewildered by the premature\r\nunfolding of its mysteries. They will then go forward, prepared, not\r\nmerely to acquire the technicalities of a profession, but to\r\ninvestigate its essential principles; to avoid those _ignes fatui_,\r\nwhich so often, with the appearance of truth, mislead and destroy, and\r\ndraw out from the depths, the living form of truth itself; and thus\r\ncontribute to the destined emancipation of the world from ignorance,\r\nand prejudice, and misrule, and the worse influence of false\r\nphilosophy. I would not be extreme; but when we consider the\r\ncontrolling influence of mind of those who are accredited as the\r\nteachers and guides of other men, and how important that this should\r\nbe an influence of reason, of knowledge, and of truth, and how slowly\r\nand carefully its foundation requires to be laid in the youthful mind,\r\nwe may well dread to embarrass the process, either by any accidental\r\nimpressions and associations, or by prematurely trusting to its\r\ncompletion. Nor should an exception be claimed even in favor of the\r\nChristian ministry. However desirable that they who contemplate this\r\noffice should be early qualified for the service of God, and of their\r\nfellow men, yet they may not safely trespass upon college hours, by\r\nanticipating those higher studies, which await them on other grounds.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be obliged to trespass further upon the time of this\r\nassembly, while I glance at a few particulars connected with the\r\nattainment of the single end of a collegial education. It has been\r\nalleged, that the preparatory schools have frequently failed in\r\nqualifying the mind for successful application to the exercises of\r\ncollege. And it has been answered, that college has sent out into the\r\nschools inadequate instructors. The evil which is admitted is probably\r\non both sides, and an obvious remedy will be found, in stating and\r\nrigidly exacting such terms of matriculation as shall at once bring\r\ninto requisition the most thorough preparatory instruction, and\r\nprovide that such instruction may always be obtained.\r\n\r\n\"It is evident that, other things being equal, those who, by reason of\r\nsuperior early advantages, are prepared to enter upon the prescribed\r\nexercises of college with more readiness and effect than others, will\r\nordinarily prosecute and finish their course with proportionably\r\nhigher reputation. Indeed, to the want of a thorough initiation into\r\nthe rudiments of learning may be traced much of that indolence and\r\nfickleness and easy yielding to temptation, by which the mind,\r\nuntaught in the labor of successful occupation, and discouraged by the\r\nfailure of its imprudent efforts, is presently paralyzed, and lost to\r\nevery honorable and useful purpose. If then it may be provided that\r\nearly instruction shall be more adequate, and the mind of the student\r\nshall be prepared to enter with readiness and effect upon the studies\r\nof college, we shall inspire him with that confidence in his own\r\nability and endeavors which is one of the strongest inducements to\r\nexertion, and shall insure a degree of improvement limited only by his\r\ncapacity and application. It may be true, that some of our colleges,\r\nby reason of the temptations of poverty, and the zeal of competition,\r\naccommodating themselves to the convenience of youth, have not\r\nincreased in their demands in proportion to the advances which have\r\nbeen already made in elementary instruction. Such have doubtless\r\nmistaken their true interests. It is believed, that those institutions\r\nwhich shall lead in exacting the most extensive and thorough\r\npreparation, will have a distinction and a patronage proportioned to\r\nthe benefits which they shall thus render to society.\r\n\r\n\"It is of equal importance, that our colleges should be furnished with\r\nthe materials of study. It was a significant maxim, I think of\r\nJuvenal, that it is a great part of learning to know where learning\r\nmay be found. For, after ascertaining the place of treasure, it is\r\nusual to feel the kindling desire of acquisition, and the mind at once\r\nreceives a corresponding impulse to exertion. The man who has wasted\r\nhis best days in mental inaction, may feel himself so humbled amidst\r\nthe productions of genius and learning, which have not instructed him,\r\nand instruments, of which he knows not the use, and specimens and\r\nmodels whose properties and beauties he cannot distinguish, that he\r\nwill wish rather to retreat and forget his poverty, in the\r\ngratifications of inferior appetite. But, on these same scenes, the\r\nfires of youthful unprostituted ambition glow with a new intensity,\r\nand the mind, here waking to the consciousness of its own energies,\r\naspires to the elevation and dignity for which it is designed. The\r\nwell stored library and philosophical room and cabinet, create an\r\natmosphere, in which it acts with an unwonted freedom and force, and\r\nstrengthens itself for the high and laborious service to which it is\r\ndevoted.\r\n\r\n\"But, apart from the influence of such scenes and their associations,\r\nthere are more palpable reasons, which especially at this day, call\r\nfor a great increase of books and apparatus in our literary\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\"The time has been, when a few worn out text books, descending from\r\none generation of students to another, were thought sufficient for the\r\npurposes of a liberal education. But, in that wider range of\r\ninvestigation, to which the mind is now directed, in all departments\r\nof study, every source of information requires to be laid open. It is\r\nnot the lesson from a single author, that is alone sufficient to be\r\ncommitted, but the _subject_, of which possibly a score have treated,\r\nthat requires to be examined and understood. And neither can the\r\nteacher nor the student feel himself adequate to the services before\r\nhim while any valuable authority, on the broad field of his inquiries,\r\nis not accessible, or any means of illustration are unattempted. But\r\nthese facilities are clearly beyond the resources of individuals, and\r\nhowever voluntary associations of students may, to some extent,\r\ncompensate for private inability, there is a point beyond which public\r\nsentiment declares this to be a burden; and it demands that the\r\ninstitutions themselves, which proffer the benefits of education,\r\nshould supply the means by which this end is to be attained. The\r\nquestion between different places of education, is coming to be\r\ndecided, more frequently, by reference to the comparative advantages\r\nwhich they afford in this respect; and, however it may be necessary\r\nthat a college should hold out some show of other accommodation, yet\r\nneither the convenience of its situation, nor the splendor of its\r\nedifices, nor the number and variety of its departments and\r\ninstructors, will be held in estimation, without corresponding\r\nadvantages for an extended course of study.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to a course of study, it were almost adventurous for one\r\nwithout the advantages of experience on this subject, to remark beyond\r\nwhat is already obvious, that it should be simply accommodated to the\r\nmost perfect discipline and instruction of the mind. And yet, perhaps,\r\nit were more presumptuous to suppose, that improvement in this respect\r\nhas already reached its limits. The changes which have taken place,\r\nand are still occurring in the methods of instruction, at the\r\npreparatory schools, may be hoped so far to hasten the development and\r\nstrengthening of the intellectual powers as that the student may come,\r\nat an earlier period of his college course, to that class of studies\r\nwhich call more immediately for the use of reason, and give it\r\ndirection in its inquiries after truth. The impulse which the mind\r\nreceives from an acquaintance with its own powers, and their\r\napplication to some branches of intellectual philosophy, is a matter\r\nof general experience. Every one recollects the pleasure of his first\r\nacquisitions in this department of study, and the ardor with which he\r\nthenceforth aspired to higher attainments. He breathed a free air, he\r\nwent forward with a new confidence, and his application to all the\r\nduties before him became more easy and more successful. If, then, we\r\nmight, almost on the threshold of a public education, habituate the\r\nmind to itself, and aid it in some of the more simple essays of its\r\nown powers, it would seem, that we should prepare it for the readier\r\nperception of classic beauties, and for mastering more effectually the\r\nelements of mathematical, political, and moral science. Study in\r\nevery department ceases to be a mechanical process, when the mind is\r\nthus accustomed, and then we have assurance that study will be a\r\npleasure, and that what becomes a pleasure will be gain and glory.\r\n\r\n\"If it were asked, whether any branch of college study might be\r\nspared, few, probably, would be ready to affirm. However, in the zeal\r\nof innovation, the utility of classical learning has been decried, it\r\nis not probable that the name of scholar will ever be awarded to one\r\nwho has not loved to spend his days and nights upon the pages of\r\nantiquity, nor drunk deep from these original sources of taste, and\r\ngenius, and philosophy. We believe it has rarely, if ever happened,\r\nthat one has attained to a symmetry and finished excellency of\r\ncharacter, in the varieties of any one department of learning, who has\r\nnot, at least in the early stages of education, received inspiration\r\nfrom the oratory and poetry of other times, when language was an index\r\nto the passions and emotions of the soul, and conveyed, not the names\r\nonly, but the properties of things, the qualities of mind. The very\r\nvigor of thought and power of eloquence with which many, with a\r\nparricidal spirit, have assailed the literature of antiquity, were\r\nborrowed from its stores; and should their schemes of reform prevail\r\nwe might fear that other generations, inheriting only their\r\nprejudices, without their refinement, would degenerate into\r\ncomparative barbarism, and with that of learning, that the light also\r\nof religion would be extinguished. It is the _worst_ of this spirit\r\nthat it would seal up the treasures of heavenly wisdom, and take away\r\nthe armor in which we trust for assailing the enemies of God. And\r\nhowever it may be with other interests, we will hope that in this\r\nrespect, as well as ordinarily in all others, the pulpit will prove a\r\ndefence of the true interests of man. But, it may be questioned\r\nwhether, if the field of labor were narrowed, and instead of gleaning\r\nas is usually done, from many writers, the student should be more\r\nthorough in his application to a few of the most approved, the end of\r\nthis branch of study would not be as fully answered, and opportunity\r\nbe afforded for greater acquisitions in the literature of modern\r\ntimes. It has been said, particularly in regard to our own language\r\nand country, that the style of writing, of conversation, and of\r\npublic speaking, among educated men, generally fails of that accuracy,\r\npropriety, and refinement which might reasonably be expected from\r\ntheir course of preparatory and professional study. The college is\r\nundoubtedly the place where the evil, if it be admitted to exist,\r\nshould be corrected. And its correction would be found in the greater\r\nprogress of the student, beyond the task of composition, to the\r\nexamination of the most approved vernacular writings. It is not so\r\nmuch by his own imperfect attempts as by familiarity with the nature\r\nand finished productions of other minds, that he may expect to\r\nfacilitate his conceptions, to extend the circle of his thoughts, to\r\ncorrect his judgment and his taste, and thus increase the readiness,\r\npropriety, and effect of his future efforts. A course of thorough\r\nreading and comparison of accredited authors, in connection with\r\noccasional researches into the history of English literature and\r\nessays at higher criticism, will probably do more towards the\r\naccomplishment of polite scholarship than all the principles of\r\ngrammar and rhetoric, however perfectly understood, without\r\nopportunity for such an application.\r\n\r\n\"The actual instruction of college, and its general economy and\r\nadministration, are subjects, doubtless, of yet higher consideration.\r\nBut, in view of the recent measures of the Trustees of this\r\ninstitution, to advance its interests in these particulars, remarks in\r\nthis place, and on this occasion, might be judged unseasonable. I\r\nshall be permitted, however, just to allude to these measures, as an\r\nevidence of the deep solicitude with which the institution is\r\ncherished by its constituted guardians, and as a pledge, that in all\r\nthings which relate to its modes of government, discipline, and\r\ninstruction, they will not be backward to provide that it shall answer\r\nthe great purposes of its foundation. And in view of the success which\r\nalready appears to have attended the application of these measures,\r\nthrough the zeal of the Faculty of the college, and the commendable\r\nspirit of the students, the hope may well be encouraged, that this\r\nvenerable seat of learning, which has been the care of Almighty God,\r\nwill not fail of His blessing, nor want the confidence, affection, and\r\npatronage of an intelligent community.\r\n\r\n\"But, what is more necessary than any other means and advantages, and\r\nwithout which the growth of any literary institution were to be\r\ndeprecated as one of the greatest of evils, is the pervading influence\r\nof moral and religious principle. The moral dangers of a college life\r\nhave probably been sometimes enhanced in the representation. When the\r\narrangement of duties is such as to require of the student as much use\r\nof time, and a habit of application as constant and persevering, as\r\nare ordinarily expected in the employments of active life, he would\r\nseem, so far, in respect to his principles and his habits, to have an\r\nadvantage over others, inasmuch as intellectual labor is, in itself,\r\nbetter suited to refine and elevate the affections, and removes one\r\nfarther from the scenes and objects of temptation. If we add to this,\r\nthat the student is usually under a more uniform superintendence, and\r\ncomes more frequently and habitually under the influence of moral\r\nprecept and religious observances, and that the fact of his supposed\r\ndangers makes him more a subject of parental solicitude and counsel\r\nand prayer, his advantage is still proportionably increased. And in\r\nrespect to those institutions where these benefits are in the highest\r\ndegree enjoined, it is believed that the amount of injury to the youth\r\nwho frequent them is less than that which is suffered by any equal\r\nnumber, in any other sphere of occupation.\r\n\r\n\"It must, nevertheless, be admitted, that there are dangers to the\r\nstudent in some respects peculiar, affecting deeply the principles of\r\naction, and which require a greater care to be prevented, because of\r\nthe influence which he is destined to exert in future life. The very\r\ncultivation of mind has frequently a tendency to impair the moral\r\nsensibilities, to induce that pride of conscious ability and variety\r\nof attainments, which, as they are most of all affections offensive to\r\nGod, so they become, surely, though insensibly, most pernicious in\r\ntheir influence upon the individuals themselves who cherish them, and\r\ncontribute to poison those streams which ought only to carry abroad\r\nhealth and blessing to the world. That spirit of emulation, also,\r\nwhich is naturally excited among so many aspirants for an honorable\r\ndistinction, too often leads, on the one hand, in those who excel, to\r\nan overweening selfishness and an insatiable ambition, which, in the\r\ncourse of life, sacrifice all principle and the highest interests of\r\nsociety to private gratification; and, on the other, in those whose\r\nhopes are disappointed, to a destroying negligence and sensuality. Nor\r\nis it to be denied, that the unsanctified literature of antiquity, and\r\nmany of the productions of our own times, which have the greatest\r\npower of attraction over the minds of youth, cannot be assiduously\r\ncultivated without danger of corrupting the moral sentiments, and\r\nministering strength to the wrong affections of the mind. Against\r\nthese evils, and others, more immediately pernicious, which are\r\nincident to numerous associations of youth, a moral influence, pure,\r\nconstraining and habitual, requires to be exerted. It is now more than\r\never demanded, and the fact is most creditable to the spirit of the\r\ntimes, that a literary institution should be a safe resort, and no\r\nother advantages will, in the common estimation, compensate for defect\r\nand failure in this particular. The relations which every individual\r\nstudent sustains to God and to eternity, call imperiously and aloud,\r\nthat the great principles of moral obligation, the everlasting\r\ndistinctions between right and wrong, the methods of the Divine\r\nadministration, and the solemnities of eternal retribution, should be\r\nkept before him, in all their significancy, and enforced by the\r\nconstraining motives of the gospel of Jesus Christ, without which all\r\nsecondary authority and influence will be comparatively vain. The\r\nrelations also of the whole body of students to their country and the\r\nworld demand, and the admonition is sounded out from every corner of\r\nour land, from the city, and the field, and even from the desert, that\r\nhere should be laid the foundation of those virtuous habits, of that\r\nreverence for God, and practical regard for His ordinances, without\r\nwhich the influence of our educated men will gradually undermine the\r\nfair fabric of our national freedom, and the ruins of our country will\r\nbe heaped up for an everlasting memorial, that neither liberty, nor\r\nlearning, nor wealth, nor arts, nor arms, can stay the decline of that\r\npeople among whom the redeeming spirit of Christianity has no\r\npermanent abode. I know, indeed, that college is no place for infusing\r\nor fostering sectarian prejudices, nor for preferring the weapons of\r\nsectarian warfare. No spirit of party should walk abroad on this\r\ncommon ground. No distinctive privileges of a denomination should here\r\nbe ever claimed or allowed. But, as none are exempted from their\r\nobligations to God, and none are safe without His blessing, it is most\r\nevident that this should be the first and last of our labor with those\r\nwho are themselves immortal, and whose influence is so connected with\r\nthe highest interests of their fellow men, to encourage a spirit of\r\ninwrought piety, and instill the lessons of practical obedience. That\r\nis the noblest of all efforts which has respect to the preparation of\r\nmind for the service of its Creator among its kindred intelligences,\r\nand for the joys of an immortal life. And that will be a glorious\r\nconsummation (may it be ours to hasten it) when the destined alliance\r\nbetween religion and learning shall be perfected, and their united\r\ninfluence shall be employed, and shall prevail, to raise a world from\r\nignorance and sin and wretchedness, to the dignity and the privilege\r\nof the sons of God. And let us hope, both in regard to this college,\r\nwhose interests we now cherish, and all other kindred institutions,\r\nthat amidst the changes of society by which they are occasionally\r\naffected, and the adversities by which they are depressed, we shall\r\nsee the vindication of that rule of Providence by which good is always\r\neduced from evil. Let us believe that those prejudices and mistakes\r\nand errors and abuses, which are wont, in undisturbed prosperity, to\r\nbecome inveterate, shall be done away; that those improvements which\r\nmay be expected to flow from the influence of free governments and a\r\nfree Christianity shall prevail, and shall contribute to make the\r\nreign of liberty and knowledge and truth not only universal in extent,\r\nbut perpetual in duration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE POLICY OF THE COLLEGE, ITS PROGRESS, AND ENLARGEMENT UNDER\r\nPRESIDENT LORD'S ADMINISTRATION, FROM 1828 TO 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Lord's official course was marked by a judicious\r\nconservatism.\r\n\r\nIn nothing was this more conspicuous than in his treatment of the\r\nmatter of \"college honors.\" Near the close of his administration, the\r\noccasion requiring, he published a statement, in which we find the\r\nfollowing language:\r\n\r\n\"It will be recollected that about a quarter of a century ago there\r\narose a simultaneous questioning among the students at most of the New\r\nEngland colleges, in regard to college appointments in general. It was\r\na spontaneous movement of the young men, consequent upon an unusual\r\nreligious awakening among them, and seemed a common reaction of\r\nconscience against a common injurious custom. The students of this\r\ncollege were excited more than others. At least, they were more\r\ndemonstrative. By memorial, they unanimously requested the Trustees to\r\nabolish the existing system.\r\n\r\n\"The Trustees gave great attention to the request. Having ascertained\r\nthat the Faculty would readily try the experiment of a change,\r\nalthough but two of them were convinced of its utility, they set aside\r\nthe existing system of exhibitions, prizes, assignments, etc., and\r\nordained the present system, which fully and consistently excludes the\r\nprinciple of the old. This action of the Trustees was thorough,\r\nconsistent, and decisive, and was far in advance of what had taken\r\nplace in any other institution. It gave great content to the students.\r\nIt was followed by many tokens of public approbation. The Faculty at\r\nonce found their administration relieved, simplified, and greatly\r\nfacilitated in general. The college rapidly attained to a degree of\r\npatronage and prosperity unprecedented in its history.\r\n\r\n\"After a few years, a severe outside pressure produced a degree of\r\nanxiety in regard to the prudence, if not the principle, of the\r\nchange. Some distinguished alumni of the college, and other gentlemen,\r\nremonstrated against it as an innovation not soundly moral and\r\nconservative, but radical and disorganizing. They feared that the\r\ncollege would lose its tone and dignity among learned institutions.\r\nThe Trustees, though not convinced, were stirred, and again asked the\r\njudgment of the Faculty.\r\n\r\n\"The Faculty replied, that, although they had not, as a body,\r\nrecommended the adoption of the new system, they had given it, as duty\r\nrequired, a fair experiment, and were constrained to say, that it had\r\nturned out better than their expectations. Notwithstanding some\r\ninconvenience, it had obviated serious evils, had secured\r\nunquestionable benefits, and had given a decided impulse to the\r\ncollege. They were not prepared to advise its discontinuance.\r\nWhereupon the Trustees resolved to adhere.\r\n\r\n\"Yet, after another short term of years, changes having occurred both\r\nin the Trustees and Faculty, and the outside pressure still\r\ncontinuing, the subject again came under the discussion of the Board.\r\nIn that instance it was formally proposed by a majority of the\r\nFaculty. Some new members had been added to that body, who had had no\r\nexperience, as college officers, of the old system. Others had left\r\nit, and some had seen reasons to change their opinions. A large\r\nmajority requested that the old _régime_, or something analogous to\r\nit, should be restored.\r\n\r\n\"The minority confidently protested. They had had experience on both\r\nsides, and were satisfied that the new system had greatly the\r\nadvantage of the old, both in respect to principle and practical\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\"The Trustees gave the subject their attentive consideration,\r\ncanvassed conflicting reasons, and still adhered. They enjoined it\r\nupon the Faculty to abide by the new system, and to keep its principle\r\ninviolate in the college discipline.\r\n\r\n\"Since that time the question has been at rest. Whatever differences\r\nof opinion may have existed in the Board or in the Faculty, they have\r\nnot interfered with the regular and faithful administration of affairs\r\nupon the prescribed basis. The college has not suffered. It has not\r\nceased to flourish, in respect to sound instruction, easy and\r\neffective discipline, a righteous order, thorough scholarship, a\r\nliberal patronage, and an honorable position. It is believed to be not\r\nbehind any of its sister colleges in the proper characteristics of a\r\nlearned institution, even though measured not by its best, but its\r\naverage scholarship, as determined by lot, in the exercises of the\r\nCommencement. Its order has become so well settled and understood in\r\nthis respect, that any reversal of it, principle apart, might be\r\nattended with inconveniences and hazards more than sufficient to\r\ncounterbalance any supposed possible or probable advantages.\r\n\r\n\"But it is eminently due to the learned Memorialists [Alumni], and to\r\nother friends and patrons of the college, to explain more fully the\r\ntheory on which the Trustees have acted, and which applies equally to\r\nthe questions now in hand. Wherefore your Committee go on to observe,\r\nas first principles:\r\n\r\n\"1. That a college is a public institution, designed and incorporated\r\nto qualify young men for leaders of the Church and the State.\r\n\r\n\"2. That the requisite qualifications for such leadership are\r\nknowledge, wisdom, and virtue. Accidental accomplishments are\r\nimportant in giving prominence and effect to more substantial\r\nqualities; but these are fundamental and indispensable. Without them\r\nthe public interests, so far as connected with college, have no\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n\"3. That these qualifications are valueless in separation from each\r\nother; and are then likely to be injurious in proportion to the degree\r\nof culture. Knowledge without wisdom is insane and mischievous; and\r\nboth without virtue serve but to give greater energy and efficiency to\r\nthose naturally destructive elements which are common both to\r\nindividuals and society. Virtue alone, if it could be supposed to\r\nexist without knowledge and wisdom, would be but an idea, or an\r\nemotion, and practically futile.\r\n\r\n\"4. That the organization and discipline of a college constitute what\r\nwe denominate its order; and the highest responsibility rests on its\r\nappointed guardians, to perfect and preserve this necessary order\r\nagreeably to the highest standards that are known among men.\r\n\r\n\"5. That the ultimate standard, binding on all Christian educators, is\r\nthe Scripture; and their ultimate responsibility is to God. Great\r\nlatitude is given them by the State; and they are not held accountable\r\nto the civil authorities, in the widest exercise of their discretion,\r\nwhile they infringe not upon the civil statutes. The State leaves them\r\nto their own opinions and policy, within the terms of their chartered\r\nprivileges and the laws in general. The Church has no control over\r\nthem whatever but in respect to patronage, when they are constituted\r\nas mere civil corporations; and it may not interfere with them but as\r\nindividual men; nor then, if they happen to sustain no individual and\r\npersonal relations to it. But the State and the Church are equally\r\nordained of God; and all educators are responsible to Him that the\r\ncomprehensive order of their institutions shall be in agreement with\r\nthe principles of His Word, and thereby subservient to the public\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\"6. That the order of a college is, first, mechanical, in respect to\r\nits forms, arrangements, and observances; and, secondly, moral, in\r\nrespect to principle.\r\n\r\n\"7. That college mechanism in general should have respect to the most\r\nperfect development of the powers of students, and be carried on with\r\ngreat exactness and fidelity; that any want of symmetry, proportion,\r\nfinish, balance, and executive ability, or frequent experimenting and\r\nchange to meet internal difficulties, or the humors and caprices of\r\nsociety, must tend to failure and dishonor. But that no mechanism,\r\nhowever organically perfect or judiciously administered, that does not\r\nembody a righteous moral principle, or that cannot be operated in\r\nconsistency with it, can be otherwise than injurious in its ultimate\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\"Whereupon your Committee propose, that a system of scholarships and\r\nprizes, as such systems have usually obtained, cannot be introduced\r\ninto college mechanism, or be carried on, consistently with righteous\r\nprinciple, and favorably to virtue in young men, or to true knowledge\r\nand wisdom, so far as these presuppose virtue, and depend upon it.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to the views here set forth, it is proper to remark, that\r\nreasoning which had much force, a score of years since, would possibly\r\nhave less at the present time.\r\n\r\nIn regard to this period the librarian says:\r\n\r\n\"In 1830, the three libraries must have numbered in volumes between\r\n12,000 and 13,000, with slight difference in numbers, the college\r\nlibrary being the largest, and the United Fraternity's the smallest.\r\nThe first library catalogue of the latter society was printed previous\r\nto 1840, and contained the titles of 4,900 volumes.\r\n\r\n\"In 1840, the libraries obtained better accommodations by the erection\r\nof Reed Hall, which was so far completed that the books were shelved\r\njust before the Commencement. They were given the second floor of the\r\nbuilding, an amount of space which then seemed to give ample room for\r\nadditions, as the three libraries together numbered only 15,000\r\nvolumes. The college library occupied the east half of the floor,\r\nwhile the west side was divided between the two society libraries. The\r\nbooks were first shelved against the wall, then alcoves and cases were\r\nadded as long as space remained, while for several years previous to\r\nthe present time the least valuable books have been removed to make\r\nspace for additions.\r\n\r\n\"In the college library, borrowers have generally been excluded from\r\nthe rooms in which books are kept, while the reverse has been true in\r\nthe society libraries.\r\n\r\n\"In June, 1841, the professors of the college with the assistance of\r\nsome of the gentlemen of the vicinity formed a society since known as\r\nthe 'Northern Academy.' This society, which was afterwards chartered\r\nand has been continued in different forms until the present time,\r\nearly began the formation of a library. While many old books have been\r\ncollected, its principal value lies in pamphlets and files of\r\nnewspapers, some of which covering a number of years extend back\r\nbeyond the Revolution. This collection, now swelled to several\r\nthousand, has always been in connection with the college library,\r\nalthough for several years a want of shelf room and a greater want of\r\nfunds to place it in usable condition, have made it of little\r\npractical value. In 1850, the three libraries having changed little\r\ncomparatively, numbered 19,000 volumes. The 'Northern Academy,'\r\nexclusive of the unbound, had over 1,000 volumes, thus making fully\r\n20,000 volumes accessible. A distinction must be made between the\r\nfigures given under the different dates (which indicate the number\r\nthat were actually in the libraries), and the number according to\r\ncatalogues. The latter were made by adding to former lists the books\r\nreceived during different years, when in fact the additions during\r\nsome of these years did not more than make good the losses. It\r\nfrequently happened that ten percent of the catalogued number could\r\nnot be accounted for. While the society libraries have continued with\r\nnearly the same annual additions--an average actual yearly increase of\r\nover a hundred volumes,--the great growth of the college library has\r\ntaken place since 1850. Since that year have been received the\r\ndonations of books for the different departments of instruction and\r\nthe funds upon which the constant growth of the library depends. Of\r\nthese funds the first had its origin in 1846, when Edmund Parker of\r\nNashua, Isaac Parker of Boston, and Joel Parker of Keene, gave $1,000.\r\nThis was subsequently increased by the latter to $7,000, and in his\r\nwill (which founded the Law School), provisions were made, that will,\r\nwhen available, place this fund at $20,000. In 1852, Dr. George C.\r\nShattuck, whose name is associated with the Observatory, gave $1,000\r\nfor the department of Mathematics as applied to Mechanics and\r\nAstronomy. To this during the same year he added $200 for Natural\r\nPhilosophy and Astronomy, and $800 for the Latin language and\r\nLiterature. At the same time Dr. Roswell Shurtleff, Emeritus\r\nProfessor, gave $1,000 for better providing with books the departments\r\nof Intellectual and Moral Philosophy and Political Economy. These\r\nthree donations were intended principally for the use of instructors,\r\nand were accompanied with restrictions from general circulation. In\r\n1859, by the will of Dr. Henry Bond of Philadelphia, several hundred\r\nvolumes were received, and provisions were made for a library fund\r\nwhich when available will be about $11,000. The late Hon. Samuel\r\nAppleton established in 1845, a fund which was increased in 1854, and\r\nis known as the Appleton Fund. The income of this has been partially\r\napplied to the purchase of books relating to Natural Philosophy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Press\" in Hanover is worthy of notice in this connection. We\r\nquote from a published address by Professor Sanborn:\r\n\r\n\"No man lives in Hanover to-day, who can tell when any newspaper was\r\nfirst printed in the town, or when it ceased to be printed. Even the\r\npapers themselves have perished. Here and there, a stray number, or\r\npossibly a bound volume, may be found among the useless lumber of an\r\nattic. There was a press in Hanover, before the close of the last\r\ncentury. It is reported that a newspaper was published there prior to\r\nthe year 1799. I have been unable to find a copy of it. In 1799, Mr.\r\nWebster delivered a Fourth-of-July oration before the citizens of\r\nHanover, which was published in that town. A eulogy, by the same\r\norator, on a deceased classmate, was also published the next year.\r\nMoses Davis, a citizen of the place, began the publication of the\r\n'Dartmouth Gazette,' August 27, 1799. How long he continued to edit\r\nand publish the paper, I cannot certainly ascertain. A paper bearing\r\nthat name was published for at least twenty years. I have a number of\r\nthe 'Dartmouth Gazette' dated June 23, 1819, being No. XLIII., vol.\r\n19. The whole number to this date of the paper, in this form, is 1025.\r\nIt was then printed and published by Charles Spear. It would seem,\r\ntherefore, that the paper which originated with Moses Davis, lived for\r\nmore than twenty years. It was a valuable paper, containing a careful\r\nsummary of foreign news, sometimes long orations of English statesmen,\r\nand an accurate record of local events. The original pieces were quite\r\nnumerous, written by occasional contributors, many of them students of\r\nthe college. The editorials were brief; in fact, a majority of the\r\nearly numbers contain no words which appear as editorial. The\r\npolitical articles were decidedly favorable to the Federal party, but\r\nmoderate in tone. During the first three years of the existence of\r\nthis paper, Daniel Webster, then a student, was a frequent\r\ncontributor; he wrote both prose and poetry, more frequently the\r\nlatter. The topics were trite, but the thoughts were always serious\r\nand elevated. In the issue of December 9, 1799, Mr. Webster published\r\na poem on winter; he was then a Junior in college. The European wars\r\ncommanded his attention and saddened his reflections.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Webster continued to write for the paper after leaving college.\r\nIn his published correspondence, there is a letter from the editor\r\nimportuning him to write the 'Newsboy's Message' for January, 1803. He\r\nsays: 'I want a genuinely Federal address, and you are the very person\r\nto write it. And this solicitation, sir, is not from me alone--some of\r\nour most respectable characters join in the request.'\r\n\r\n\"The 'Dartmouth Gazette' was the champion of the college during the\r\nentire period of its controversy with the State. Many of the ablest\r\narticles written in defence of the college, appeared in its columns. I\r\nregret that I cannot give the entire history of this useful paper; it\r\ndid a good work in its day, and we may now say literally, 'peace to\r\nits ashes.'\r\n\r\n\"During a portion of the existence of the 'Dartmouth Gazette,' while\r\nit was edited by Charles Spear, another paper was printed by Moses\r\nDavis, called 'The Literary Tablet,' purporting to be edited by\r\nNicholas Orlando. Whether this is a _nomme de plume_ or a real name, I\r\ncannot determine. Three volumes are known to have been published. It\r\nlived for three years at least. The third volume dates from August,\r\n1805, to August, 1806. It was a folio of four pages, three columns to\r\na page, of about fourteen inches by twelve in size. It was printed\r\nevery other Wednesday for the editor.\r\n\r\n\"A new paper appeared in Hanover, June, 1820. The prospectus was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"'A new weekly paper in Hanover, N. H., to be entitled the \"Dartmouth\r\nHerald.\" The \"Dartmouth Gazette\" having been discontinued, the\r\nsubscribers, at the solicitation of a number of literary gentlemen,\r\npropose to publish a paper under the above title. Besides\r\nadvertisements, the \"Herald\" will embrace accounts of our National and\r\nState Legislatures, and the most interesting articles of news, foreign\r\nand domestic; notices of improvements in the arts and sciences,\r\nespecially agriculture and the mechanical arts most practiced in our\r\nown country; and essays, original and selected, upon the mechanical\r\nand liberal Arts, Literature, Politics, Morals and Religion.\r\n\r\n\"'The original articles will be furnished by a society of gentlemen;\r\nand it is confidently expected will not be unworthy of the interesting\r\nsubjects, to which a considerable space will be allotted in this\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n    \"'Bannister & Thurston.\r\n    \"'Hanover, April 7, 1820.'\r\n\r\n\"It was a small folio of four pages, twenty by twelve inches in size.\r\nIt was well filled with news and original contributions. Its life was\r\nbrief. Unfortunately, no record was made either on the printed page or\r\nthe faithful memory, of the date of its decease, so far as I can\r\nlearn.\r\n\r\n\"For several years no periodical was published in Hanover. 'The\r\nMagnet,' an octavo of sixteen pages, edited by students and published\r\nby Thomas Mann, appeared in 1835. The first number bears date October\r\n21, 1835. There seems to have been a rival paper contemporary with\r\nthis, called 'The Independent Chronicle.' In the November number of\r\nthe 'Magnet,' we find this allusion to it: 'The second number of the\r\n\"Independent Chronicle\" is below criticism.' In the December number,\r\nthe 'Magnet' chronicles the demise of its despised rival, with evident\r\nsatisfaction. In 1837, another student's periodical appeared, called\r\n'The Scrap Book.' I am unable to write its history; it was probably of\r\nbrief duration. In 1839, the students of Dartmouth College originated\r\na literary periodical called 'The Dartmouth.' It was published, I\r\nthink, for five years. The editors were chosen from the undergraduates\r\nby the Senior class. Among the editors of 1840-41, were J. E. Hood and\r\nJames O. Adams, both of whom have since gained honorable distinction\r\nin a wider field of editorial labor. A few months ago, I received as a\r\npresent from B. P. Shillaber, the witty and genial author of the 'Life\r\nand Sayings of Mrs. Partington,' and other humorous works, a volume of\r\n'The Dartmouth,' which he received from Mr. Hood. It was handsomely\r\nbound, and labelled 'Brains' on the back. Mr. Shillaber says of it in\r\na letter, dated July 4, 1872, 'I find, that the volume comprises but a\r\nhalf year ending with Hood's editorship and graduation. It\r\nnevertheless will prove interesting; and it gives me pleasure to\r\npresent it, with a delightful memory of Dartmouth to commend the\r\ntrifle. I thought it might gratify you personally, as several of your\r\neffusions are contained in it. Poor Hood has crossed the dark stream:\r\nhe died in Colorado last winter. He held you in enduring regard. The\r\ntitle is a boyish suggestion; but there is more evidence of \"_brains_\"\r\nin it than is to be found in many far more pretentious publications.'\r\n\r\n\"These remarks will apply with equal justice to the entire ten volumes\r\nof 'The Dartmouth.' It was highly creditable to the students who\r\noriginated and sustained it. 'The Dartmouth' was printed by Mr. E. A.\r\nAllen, who during the continuance of this periodical made several\r\nother ventures in the newspaper line. Sometime during the year 1840 or\r\n1841, he started a paper called 'The Experiment,' which was edited by\r\nJames O. Adams, then a student in college. This paper was subsequently\r\nissued in quarto form and called 'The Amulet.'\r\n\r\n\"In 1841, a periodical called the 'Iris and Record' was issued in\r\nHanover. It was published monthly, in numbers of thirty-two royal\r\noctavo pages, making two volumes each year. It was edited by 'an\r\nassociation of gentlemen,' and filled with well selected and original\r\nliterary articles. It must have had a considerable circulation, if we\r\nmay credit the assertion of the editor of No. II., vol. 3, who says:\r\n'We doubt not there are hundreds of persons, whose names are on our\r\nsubscription list, who might every month contribute a short article\r\nupon some interesting subject.' The 'Iris' was also printed by E. A.\r\nAllen.\r\n\r\n\"During the same year an anti-slavery paper was published in Hanover,\r\ncalled 'The People's Advocate,' by St. Clair and Briggs. In July,\r\n1843, J. E. Hood became its editor, and continued to publish it for\r\nmore than a year, when it was removed to Concord. 'The Advocate' was a\r\nspirited paper; and the editor, then a youth, showed himself an able,\r\nfearless, and uncompromising foe of slavery, at a time when it\r\nrequired great moral courage and liberal sacrifices of time, talent,\r\nand labor, to advocate the principles of the Free Soil Party. In\r\nFebruary, 1844, Mr. Hood established a paper in Hanover, called the\r\n'Family Visitor,' in which he advocated the various reforms of the\r\nday; and published a variety of original and selected articles in\r\nprose and poetry, for the profit and amusement of his patrons. On\r\nlooking over some of the back numbers, I find the contents as lively,\r\npiquant, and interesting, as the best journals of to-day. Mr. Hood was\r\nborn an editor, and to the day of his death he performed well his\r\npart; and when his Master bade him 'go up higher,' he left few peers\r\nbehind him in his chosen vocation.\"\r\n\r\nRev. H. A. Hazen, a reliable authority on any historical point, states\r\nthat there was a printing-press at Dresden, (which included the\r\n\"College District,\" in Hanover, and a part of Lebanon), as early as\r\n1777. Mr. Abel Curtis' Grammar was printed there by J. P. and A.\r\nSpooner, in 1779. Other works, still extant, were printed by them at\r\nabout the same period.[35]\r\n\r\n      [35] \"The Dartmouth\" having been revived in 1867, is now issued\r\n           as a Weekly Magazine.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the progress of the college during President Lord's\r\nadministration, we cannot more fitly conclude, than by adopting the\r\nlanguage of Mr. William H. Duncan, who in a valuable tribute to his\r\nworth and his memory, says:\r\n\r\n\"It was the proud boast of Augustus, that he found Rome of brick and\r\nleft it of marble. Might not President Lord, at the time of his\r\nresignation, have said without a shadow of boasting, I found the\r\ncollege, what its great counsel called it in that most touching and\r\npathetic close of his great argument in the College Case before the\r\nSupreme Court at Washington: I found it truly 'a small college'; it\r\nwas in an humble condition; its classes were small; its finances\r\nembarrassed; its buildings in a dilapidated and ruinous condition. I\r\nleft it one of the leading institutions of the land!\"\r\n\r\nFuller details on these points will be gathered from subsequent\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF PRESIDENT LORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period of President Tyler's resignation was a most critical one in\r\nthe history of the college.\r\n\r\nIts eminent founder passed away in the midst of the Revolutionary\r\nstruggle, leaving the frail bark, in which were centered fond and\r\nlong-cherished hopes, tossing upon uncertain and dangerous waters. A\r\nfearful storm was raging when his immediate successor put off the\r\nrobes of office, and a little later went \"to give account of his\r\nstewardship.\" Thirteen years had scarcely been sufficient fully to\r\nrestore to a healthy condition the discipline of the college, which\r\nhad been materially weakened by the lack of harmony between the second\r\npresident and his associates in office.\r\n\r\nMaterial aid was needed also to provide better accommodations for the\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nIn common with other colleges, Dartmouth needed most of all, in those\r\ntrying times, a president \"rooted and grounded\" in the truth.\r\n\r\nThe multiplication of colleges rendered it especially desirable, at\r\nthis period, that this college should have a man at its head well\r\nfitted and furnished for his work. In the little more than half a\r\ncentury of its existence, the number of New England colleges, founded\r\nupon the same religious faith, had increased from three to eight,\r\nrendering the best leadership necessary to meet the competition.\r\n\r\nA more judicious selection could not have been made for the sixth\r\npresident of the college.\r\n\r\nRev. Nathan Lord, the son of John and Mehitable (Perkins) Lord, was\r\nborn at Berwick, Maine, November 28, 1792, and belonged to a highly\r\nrespectable family. At the early age of sixteen, he graduated at\r\nBowdoin College, in the class of 1809. Very rarely has a student at\r\ncollege the opportunity to sit under the instruction of two such men\r\nas Joseph McKeen and Jesse Appleton, each of whom filled the\r\npresident's chair two years, while young Lord was a student.\r\n\r\nAfter valuable experience as a teacher in the Exeter Academy, he\r\npursued a theological course at the Andover Seminary, graduating in\r\n1815. He had been twelve years pastor of the Congregational Church at\r\nAmherst when called to the presidency of Dartmouth, having been for\r\nsome time a Trustee. In the intellectual strength and literary\r\nattainments of its people, this had been for a long period one of the\r\nleading towns in southern New Hampshire. Being the county seat, it was\r\nvisited periodically by gentlemen eminent in the law, with whom\r\nprofessional men resident in the place would most naturally have\r\nfrequent intercourse. At a period when the whole community was\r\nprofoundly agitated, by the most earnest and important theological\r\ncontroversy in the history of New England, we can readily understand\r\nthat the youthful preacher would have abundant opportunity to measure\r\nswords with skilled warriors, in the field of religious debate. That\r\nhe wielded his weapons, in the discussions of that period, with a\r\nforce indicating that he was a man of no ordinary mould, is a matter\r\nof history. When he entered upon his great work at Dartmouth, those\r\nwho, as its guardians, had called him to it, cherished confident hope\r\nof his success. Seldom has there been so full a realization of such\r\nhope in the history of American colleges.\r\n\r\nPresident Lord brought to the accomplishment of his task a fine\r\nphysique; a countenance serene, yet impressive; a voice rare both for\r\nits richness and its power; a pleasing, almost magnetic, dignity of\r\nmien; a mind most capacious and discriminating by nature, richly\r\nstored by severe application, and thoroughly disciplined by varied\r\nprofessional labor; and a heart always tender, yet always true to the\r\nprofoundest convictions of duty. A deep, rich, and thorough religious\r\nexperience well fitted the graceful and earnest man to be a graceful\r\nand earnest Christian teacher. The question of fitness for the\r\nposition as an executive was soon settled beyond the possibility of a\r\ndoubt. It required but a brief acquaintance with President Lord to\r\nteach any one, that he fully believed in the most literal acceptation\r\nof the doctrine, that \"the powers that be are ordained of God.\"\r\n\r\nA recognition of this fundamental law guided and governed him daily\r\nand hourly through all his public life. When early in his\r\nadministration, he discovered marked symptoms of a spirit of\r\ninsubordination in the college, he gave all concerned to understand\r\nmost fully, that it would be his duty to maintain the supremacy of the\r\nlaw. There was never any deviation from this loyalty to duty in\r\nadministering the discipline of the college. No undue regard for his\r\nown dignity, or comfort, or safety, deterred him from visiting, at any\r\nhour of day or night, the scene of disorder. When he had been more\r\nthan forty years an officer of the college he reaffirmed his adherence\r\nto this principle, in a most emphatic manner, when those to whom he\r\ndid not deem himself responsible sought to point out to him the path\r\nof duty.\r\n\r\nAs a teacher it was President Lord's province, chiefly to unfold the\r\nvarious relations and obligations of man to his Maker. In the\r\nperformance of this duty he gave remarkable prominence to the Divine\r\nRevelation. Jealous for the honor of his great Master and Teacher, he\r\nwas very suspicious, possibly too suspicious, of any intermixture of\r\n\"man's wisdom.\" This habit may have induced occasionally, measurable\r\ndisparagement of worthy and eminent men. But the genial manner and\r\nchastened tone invariably extracted the point from the severest word,\r\nand left upon the pupil's mind a profound conviction that his teacher\r\nhad been \"taught of God.\" It may well be doubted whether, of the large\r\nnumbers who graduated during President Lord's administration, any who\r\nwere brought in close contact with him, and listened with a \"willing\r\nmind\" to his instructions, failed to receive measurably, yet\r\nconsciously, the impress of their honored teacher.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from the official records of the Trustees, are\r\ndeemed worthy of insertion in this connection in order to a full\r\nunderstanding of the circumstances attending President Lord's\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\n\"Annual Meeting, July 1863. Mr. Tuck offered the following, to wit:\r\n'The undersigned has had his attention called to the accompanying\r\nresolutions passed by the Merrimack County Conference of\r\nCongregational Churches, held on the 23d and 24th of June last; and he\r\nsubmits the same to the Trustees, with a motion that a Committee be\r\nappointed to report what action thereon ought to be taken.\r\n\r\n\"'1. \"Resolved. That the people of New Hampshire have the strongest\r\ndesire for the prosperity of Dartmouth College, and that they rejoice\r\nin the wide influence this noble institution has exerted in the cause\r\nof education and religion.\r\n\r\n\"'2. \"Resolved. That we cherish a sincere regard for its venerable\r\npresident; for the rare qualifications he possesses for the high\r\noffice he has so long and ably filled; but that we deeply regret that\r\nits welfare is greatly imperiled by the existence of a popular\r\nprejudice against it, arising from the publication and use of some of\r\nhis peculiar views touching public affairs, tending to embarrass our\r\ngovernment in its present fearful struggle, and to encourage and\r\nstrengthen the resistance of its enemies in arms.\r\n\r\n\"'3. \"Resolved. That in our opinion it is the duty of the Trustees of\r\nthe College to seriously inquire whether its interests do not demand a\r\nchange in the presidency; and to act according to their judgment in\r\nthe premises.\"'\r\n\r\n\"Whereupon, Messrs. Tuck, Bouton, and Eastman were appointed a\r\nCommittee, to report on the subject aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Committee to whom was referred the resolutions of the Merrimack\r\nCounty Conference, respecting Dartmouth College, made the following\r\nReport:\r\n\r\n\"'The Committee have taken into most respectful consideration the\r\naction of the Conference and the sentiment pervading the churches of\r\nwhich the resolutions of the Conference are the expression. We do not\r\nforget, but thankfully avow the debt of gratitude which has rested on\r\nthe college, throughout its history, to the churches of New England,\r\nand to the pious teachings and generous patronage of those included\r\nwithin their embrace. We are fully aware of the obligations of science\r\nand literature, in all past time, to the clerical profession; that the\r\ncountenance and support of the clergy and the churches have ever been\r\nthe chief reliance of this college, and that we can hope for little\r\nprosperity or usefulness to the institution in future, without\r\nmeriting the confidence bestowed upon it in the past. We deplore the\r\npresent condition of the college in respect to the sentiments\r\nentertained towards it, as expressed in said resolutions, and we\r\nproffer our readiness to do any act which our intimate knowledge of\r\nits affairs and circumstances enable us to judge practicable and\r\nbeneficial. Neither the Trustees nor the Faculty coincide with the\r\npresident of the college in the views which he has published, touching\r\nslavery and the war; and it has been their hope that the college would\r\nnot be adjudged a partisan institution, by reason of such\r\npublications. It has been our purpose that no act of ours should\r\ncontribute to such an impression upon the public mind, inviting the\r\npublic as we do, to contribute to its support, and to partake of its\r\nprivileges.\r\n\r\n\"'It would be impracticable if it were wise to embody in this report\r\nall the reasons which induce us to propose no action by which the\r\nremoval of the president from the head of the institution should be\r\nundertaken by the Trustees; and we bespeak with confidence the\r\nfavorable judgment that we act discreetly, from the members of the\r\nConference who have expressed in their resolutions their generous\r\nappreciation of the eminent ability and qualifications of the\r\npresident for the position which he occupies.\r\n\r\n\"'Yet the Committee do not fail to see that the present crisis in the\r\ncountry is no ordinary conflict between opposing parties, but is a\r\nstruggle between the government on one side, and its enemies on the\r\nother, and that in it are involved vital issues, not only respecting\r\nscience and learning, virtue and religion, but also respecting all the\r\nsocial and civil blessings growing out of free institutions.\r\n\r\n\"'The Committee recommend that the resolutions of the Merrimack County\r\nConference, this report and the accompanying resolutions, be published\r\nin pamphlet forms, and that the Treasurer be directed to cause the\r\nsame to be circulated among the members of said Conference, and other\r\npersons, according to his discretion.\r\n\r\n    Amos Tuck.\r\n    N. Bouton.\"\r\n\r\n\"'RESOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\n\"'The Trustees of Dartmouth College, impressed with the magnitude of\r\nthe crisis now existing in public affairs, and with the vital\r\nconsequences which the issue of current events will bring to the\r\nnation and the world; and, considering that it is the duty of literary\r\ninstitutions and the men who control them to stand in no doubtful\r\nposition when the Government of the country struggles for existence;\r\ninscribe upon their records, and promulgate the following Resolutions:\r\n\r\n\"'First. We recognize and acknowledge with grateful pride, the heroic\r\nsacrifices and valiant deeds of many of the sons of Dartmouth, in\r\ntheir endeavors to defend and sustain the Government against the\r\npresent wicked and remorseless rebellion; and we announce to the\r\nliving now on the battlefields, to the sick and the maimed in the\r\nhospitals and among their friends, and to the relatives of such of\r\nthem as have fallen in defense of their country, that Dartmouth\r\nCollege rejoices to do them honor, and will inscribe their names and\r\ntheir brave deeds upon her enduring records.\r\n\r\n\"'Second. We commend the cause of our beloved country to all the\r\nAlumni of this Institution; and we invoke from them, and pledge our\r\nown most efficient and cordial support, and that of Dartmouth College,\r\nto the Government, which is the only power by which the rebellion can\r\nbe subdued. We hail with joy and with grateful acknowledgments to the\r\nGod of our fathers, the cheering hope that the dark cloud which has\r\nheretofore obscured the vision and depressed the hearts of patriots\r\nand statesmen, in all attempts to scan the future, may in time\r\ndisappear entirely from our horizon; and that American slavery, with\r\nall its sin and shame, and the alienations, jealousies, and\r\nhostilities between the people of different sections, of which it has\r\nbeen the fruitful source, may find its merited doom in the consequence\r\nof the war which it has evoked.\r\n\r\n\"'Third. The Trustees bespeak for the College in the future the same\r\ncordial support and patronage of the Clergy and Churches of New\r\nEngland, as well as other friends of sound learning, which they have\r\ngiven to it in time past, reminding them of the obligations which the\r\ncause of education, science, and religion seem to lay upon them, to\r\nstand by this venerable Institution, in evil report and in good\r\nreport, in view of its past history and great service to the Church\r\nand the State, entertaining an abiding faith that it will triumph over\r\nall obstacles, and go down to posterity with its powers of usefulness\r\nunimpaired.'\r\n\r\n\"It was moved by Dr. Barstow that the foregoing Report and Resolutions\r\nbe accepted and adopted.\r\n\r\n\"On the question of adopting the report, two voted in the negative and\r\nfive in the affirmative. On the adoption of the preamble and second\r\nresolution, two voted in the negative and five in the affirmative, for\r\nthe first and third resolutions the vote was unanimous, so the report\r\nand resolutions were adopted.\r\n\r\n\"The president asked leave to withdraw for a short time, and Dr.\r\nBarstow was requested to take the chair.\r\n\r\n\"The President on resuming the chair read to the Trustees the\r\nfollowing paper, to wit:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"'Dartmouth College, July 24, 1863.\r\n\r\n    \"'To the Trustees of Dartmouth College:\r\n\r\n\"'In making this communication to the Hon. and Rev. Board of Trustees\r\nI take the liberty respectfully to protest against their right to\r\nimpose any religious, ethical, or political test upon any member of\r\ntheir own body or any member of the College Faculty, beyond what is\r\nrecognized by the Charter of the institution, or express statutes or\r\nstipulations conformed to that instrument, however urged or suggested,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, by individuals or public bodies assuming to be\r\nas visitors of the college, or advisers of the Trustees.\r\n\r\n\"'The action of the Trustees, on certain resolutions of the Merrimack\r\nCounty Conference of Churches, virtually imposes such a test, inasmuch\r\nas it implicitly represents and censures me as having become injurious\r\nto the college, not on account of any official malfeasance or\r\ndelinquency, for, on the contrary, its commendations of my personal\r\nand official character and conduct during my long term of service, far\r\nexceed my merits; but, for my opinions and publications on questions\r\nof Biblical ethics and interpretations, which are supposed by the\r\nTrustees to bear unfavorably upon one branch of the policy pursued by\r\nthe present administration of the government of the country.\r\n\r\n\"'For my opinions and expressions of opinion on such subject, I hold\r\nmyself responsible only to God, and the constitutional tribunals of my\r\ncountry; inasmuch as they are not touched by the Charter of the\r\ncollege, or any express statutes or stipulations. And, while my\r\nunswerving loyalty to the government of my fathers, proved and tested\r\nby more than seventy years of devotion to its true and fundamental\r\nprinciples, cannot be permanently discredited by excited passions of\r\nthe hour, I do not feel obliged when its exercise is called in\r\nquestion, to surrender my moral and constitutional right and Christian\r\nliberty, in this respect, nor to submit to any censure, nor consent to\r\nany conditions such as are implied in the aforesaid action of the\r\nBoard; which action is made more impressive upon me, in view of the\r\nprivate communications of some of its members.\r\n\r\n\"'But not choosing to place myself in any unkind relations to a body\r\nhaving the responsible guardianship of the college, a body from which\r\nI have received so many tokens of confidence and regard, and believing\r\nit to be inconsistent with Christian charity and propriety to carry on\r\nmy administration, while holding and expressing opinions injurious, as\r\nthey imagine, to the interests of the college, and offensive to that\r\nparty in the country which they [the majority] professedly represent,\r\nI hereby resign my office as president.\r\n\r\n\"'I also resign my office as Trustee. In taking leave of the college\r\nwith which I have been connected, as Trustee or President, more than\r\nforty years, very happily to myself, and, as the Trustees have often\r\ngiven me to understand, not without benefit to the college, I beg\r\nleave to assure them that I shall ever entertain a grateful sense of\r\nthe favorable consideration shown to me by themselves and their\r\npredecessors in office; and that I shall never cease to desire the\r\npeace and prosperity of the college, and that it may be kept true to\r\nthe principles of its foundation.\r\n\r\n    I am very respectfully,\r\n    \"'Your ob't serv't,\r\n    \"'N. Lord.'\"\r\n\r\n\"'Adjourned Meeting, September 21, 1863. Resolved, 'that in accepting\r\nthe resignation of President Lord, we place on record a grateful sense\r\nof his services during the long period of his administration; and his\r\nkind and courteous treatment of the Board in all their intercourse.'\"\r\n\r\nDr. Lord continued to reside at Hanover, cordially co-operating with\r\nhis successor in office, till his death, September 9, 1870. His wife,\r\nMrs. Elisabeth King (Leland) Lord, died a few months previous to her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. Asa D. Smith, D.D., of New York city, of the class of 1830, was\r\nelected the seventh president of the college. His thorough\r\nunderstanding of the field upon which he was to enter is indicated by\r\nthe following extracts from his inaugural address:\r\n\r\n\"There are four chief organic forces, by which, under the providence\r\nof God, humanity has its normal development. These, generalizing\r\nbroadly, are the family, the school, the State, and the Church.\r\nWherever you find, even in its lowest measure, a true civilization,\r\nthese exist; and as it rises they rise, sustaining to it the relation\r\nboth of cause and effect. Concerning, as they do, one and the same\r\ncomplex nature, they have, in different degrees and combinations, the\r\nsame underlying elements of power. In the family, we have, in its\r\nrudimental form, both teaching and government. It is a patriarchate--a\r\nlittle commonwealth; and to its head--a priest as well as a\r\npatriarch--that Scripture should ever be relevant, 'the church that is\r\nin thy house.' In the school, the simplest offshoot, perhaps, from a\r\ncongeries of families, we have, or ought to have, the parental\r\nelement; we have magistracy also, and a certain statehood; we have, or\r\nshould have, worship. The state, properly apprehended, is not only\r\ngovernmental but didactic--it is a teaching power; and though not, at\r\nthis age of the world, theocratic, it should be, in a large view,\r\nreligious. In the church, having specially and predominantly the\r\nlast-named characteristic,--being of divine appointment, and as\r\nministering to our imperative needs, the foster-mother of\r\ndevotion,--we have, also, as essential to its purpose, both rule and\r\ninstruction. And in the influence they wield, these great moulding\r\nagencies are perpetually interpenetrating and modifying each other.\r\n\r\n\"It is of the second of these, the school, that we are now called to\r\nspeak. The service we essay is connected with an educational\r\ninstitution, using the term in the specific sense; a fact, it may be\r\nsaid at the outset, which of itself dignifies the occasion. Not to\r\ninsist on those affinities and mutual influences just adverted to, and\r\nof which there will be further occasion to speak, there is a view of\r\neducation, a large and comprehensive one, which gives to it the very\r\ngrandest elevation. It is the end, next to that which the good old\r\nCatechism makes chief, and subordinate to that, of all the divine\r\nprovisions and arrangements. God is the great Educator of the\r\nuniverse. More glorious in his didactic offices is He than even in\r\ncreation; nay, creation was for these. Earth is our training\r\nplace--time is our curriculum; eternity will but furnish to the true\r\npupil the higher forms of his limitless advancement. We have our\r\nlessons in all providence, in all beings and things, God teaching us\r\nin and through all. No mean vocation, then, is that of the earthly\r\neducator; no unimportant theme that now in hand. Yet even of the\r\nschool in the more technical sense of the term, we cannot speak at\r\nlarge, except as in touching on any one department we more or less\r\naffect every other. Our thought may be fitly limited to that class of\r\ninstitutions which these ancient halls of learning and these\r\ninauguration solemnities naturally bring before us. The college is my\r\nsubject, considered in its proper functions and characteristics.\r\n\r\n\"I use the term college in the American sense. This, not for the poor\r\npurpose of ministering to national vanity, but because we must needs\r\ntake things as they are; and for the further reason that there is much\r\nto commend in the shape the institution here assumes. It has hardly\r\nits prototype either in the Fatherland or on the Continent. It has but\r\na partial resemblance either to the German Gymnasia or to the English\r\npreparatory schools, as of Eton and Rugby. As preliminary to\r\nprofessional study, it is in some respects far in advance of these. It\r\ndiffers materially, at once from the German and English University,\r\nand from the college as embraced in the latter. University education\r\nin Europe was once somewhat rigidly divided into two portions; the one\r\ndesigned to form the mind for whatever sphere of life; the other, the\r\n_Brodstudium_, as the Germans significantly term it, a course of\r\ntraining for some particular profession. Long ago, however, this\r\ndivision became mainly obsolete. 'On the continent,' said an eminent\r\nEnglish scholar, some years since, 'the preparatory education has been\r\ndropped; among ourselves, the professional.' He speaks, of course,\r\ncomparatively. So far as England is concerned, the same testimony is\r\nborne by a well-informed recent observer. This ancient and wise\r\ndivision is by us still maintained; with this peculiarity, that the\r\n'preparatory' education, so-called,--by which is meant the highest\r\nform of it,--is the sole work of the colleges. Professional culture is\r\nremitted to other and often separate schools. The undergraduate course\r\nis for general training; it lays the foundation for whatever\r\nsuperstructure. It has no particular reference to any one pursuit;\r\nbut, like the first part of the old University course, aims to fit the\r\nwhole man for a man's work in any specific line either of study or of\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\"In this conception of the college, there are, it is believed,\r\nimportant advantages. It is better for preparatory education; it is\r\nbetter for professional. It felicitously discriminates. It keeps\r\nthings in their place. It defines and duly magnifies each of the two\r\ngreat departments of the educational process. It is likelier to dig\r\ndeep, and build on broad and solid rock; it tends to symmetry and\r\nfinish in the superincumbent fabric.\r\n\r\n\"The college should be marked by a completeness. Rejecting the\r\nfragmentary and the unfinished, the well constituted mind ever craves\r\nthis. Modern thought, especially, is passing from an excessive\r\nnominalism to a more realistic habit; by many a broad induction, from\r\nmere details to a rounded whole: And nowhere more persistently than in\r\nrelation to institutions. The college should be complete as to its\r\nobjective scheme. There may be onesidedness here. There may be, for\r\nexample, an excessive or ill-directed pressing of utilities, as in the\r\nspeculations of Mr. Herbert Spencer; or there may be an undue\r\nexaltation of what he calls 'the decorative element.' The theoretic\r\nmaybe too exclusively pursued; or there may be a practicalness which\r\nhas too little of theory, like a cone required to stand firm on its\r\napex. There should be completeness, also, as touching the subjective\r\naim. It should embrace, in a word, the whole man, and that not in his\r\nEdenic aspects alone, but as a fallen being. You may not overlook even\r\nthe physical; the casket not merely, holding all the mental and moral\r\ntreasures--the frame-work rather, to which by subtile ties the\r\ninvisible machinery is linked, and which upholds it as it works. The\r\nworld has yet to learn fully how dependent is the inner upon the outer\r\nman, and how greatly the highest achievements of scholarship are\r\nfacilitated by proper hygienic conditions. As you pass to the\r\nintellectual, it matters little what classification you adopt, whether\r\nwith the author of the '_Novum Organum_,' in his 'Advancement of\r\nLearning,' you resolve all the powers into those of memory,\r\nimagination, and reason, or whether the minuter divisions of a more\r\nrecent philosophy are preferred; only be sure that not a single\r\nfaculty is overlooked or disparaged. Be it presentative, conservative,\r\nreproductive, representative, elaborative, regulative, or whatever the\r\nfine Hamiltonian analysis may suggest, give it its proper place and\r\nits proper scope.\r\n\r\n\"The college should be distinctly and eminently Christian. Not in the\r\nnarrow, sectarian sense--that be far from us--but in the broadest\r\nevangelical view. Our course of thought culminates here; and here does\r\nall else that has been affirmed find its proper centre and unity.\r\nChristianity is the great unity. In it, as was intimated at the\r\noutset, are all the chief elements of organic influence. It is itself\r\nthe very acme of completeness, and it tends to all symmetry and\r\nfinish. It is at once conservative and progressive, balancing\r\nperfectly the impelling and restraining forces; by a felicitous\r\nadjustment of the centripetal and centrifugal, ensuring to human\r\nnature its proper orbit. It is the golden girdle wherewith every\r\ninstitution like this should bind her garments of strength and beauty\r\nabout her.\r\n\r\n\"Were it needful to argue this point, we might put it on the most\r\nabsolute grounds. All things are Christ's; all dominions, dignities,\r\npotences; it is especially meet that we say, to-day, all institutions.\r\nIt is the grossest wrong practically to hold otherwise. It is loss,\r\ntoo, and nowhere more palpably than in the educational sphere. It is\r\nno cant saying to affirm, and that in a more than merely spiritual\r\nsense, that in Christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom and\r\nknowledge.' At his throne the lines of all science terminate; above\r\nall, the science that has man for its subject. Of all history, for\r\nexample, rightly read, how is He the burden and the glory! Otherwise\r\ntaken, it is a more than Cretan labyrinth. The Christian spirit,\r\nbesides, raising the soul to the loftiest planes of thought, giving it\r\nthe highest communions, bringing before it the grandest objects, and\r\nsecuring to all its machinery the most harmonious action, is eminently\r\nconducive to intellectual achievement. We have already said something\r\nlike this as touching moral culture; but that, be it ever remembered,\r\ntakes its proper form and direction only as it is vitally linked with\r\nChristianity. What God has joined together let not man put asunder.\r\nLet the studies which we call moral, have all a Christian baptism;\r\nand, with all our getting, let us not stop short of the cardinal\r\npoints of our most holy faith. Let the Will be still investigated, not\r\nas a brute force, or in a merely intellectual light, but in those high\r\nspiritual aspects in which our great New England metaphysician\r\ndelighted to present it. Let Butler, with his curious trestle-work of\r\nanalogy, bridge, to the forming mind, the chasm between natural and\r\nrevealed religion. Let the Christian Evidences be fully unfolded. We\r\ncan hardly dispense with them in an age, when by means of 'Westminster\r\nReviews,' and other subtle organs of infidelity, the old mode of\r\nassault being abandoned, a sapping and mining process is continually\r\ngoing forward. Let Ethical Science,--embracing in its wide sweep the\r\nEconomy of Private Life, the Philosophy of Government, and Law, which\r\n'hath its seat in the bosom of God,'--be all bathed in the light of\r\nCalvary. That light is its life. 'Let us with caution indulge the\r\nsupposition,' said the Father of our country, 'that morality can be\r\nmaintained without religion.' Let the Bible be included among our\r\ntext-books as the sun is included in the solar system; and let all the\r\nrest revolve in planetary subjection about it. Let it be studied, not\r\nin a professional, much less in a partisan way; but with the\r\nconviction that it is indispensable to the broadest culture; that\r\nwithout theology we have but a straitened anthropology; that we see\r\nnot nature aright, but as we look up through it to Nature's God. Be\r\nours, in its largest significance, the sentiment so devoutly uttered\r\nby the old Hebrew bard: 'In Thy light shall we see light.' And let the\r\ndiscipline of college, so intimately connected with its prosperity, be\r\nfashioned on the model of the Gospel. Let it copy, in its way and\r\nmeasure, the wondrous harmonies of the redemptive scheme, in which\r\n'mercy and truth are met together, righteousness and peace have kissed\r\neach other.' So shall it bless our halls with some faint reflection of\r\nthe Divine fatherhood, and give to our society some happy resemblance\r\nto a Christian family.\"\r\n\r\nA prominent feature of President Smith's administration was a greater\r\nutilization of the libraries, and the opening of a reading-room. The\r\nlibrarian says:\r\n\r\n\"The late Professor Alphæus Crosby contributed considerably to the\r\nincrease of the classical books, and Hon. Nathan Crosby has recently\r\nfurnished the means for commencing a collection of the works of\r\nDartmouth alumni. It is intended to gather all books and pamphlets\r\nwhich have been written by graduates. The collection will also include\r\nmatter relating to them and to the work of the college.\r\n\r\n\"In reviewing the history of the library their number is so great that\r\nit is impossible to mention even a small part of the benefactors;\r\ntheir best record is in the well filled shelves and the large amount\r\nof reading done in connection with the studies of the college course.\r\n\r\n\"One of the departments of the library consists of the books given by\r\nthe late General Sylvanus Thayer, founder of the school of\r\nengineering, numbering 2,000 volumes.\r\n\r\n\"Early in its history the members of the Chandler Scientific\r\nDepartment founded the 'Philotechnic Society,' the library of which,\r\ntogether with some books belonging to the department, contains 1,700\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\n\"The three society libraries continued under separate management until\r\n1874, although the societies, as far as literary work is concerned,\r\nhad for some time given way to the secret societies, and the interest\r\nin them was so slight that only with great difficulty could a quorum\r\nbe obtained for ordinary business. During that year an arrangement was\r\nmade by which the three society libraries were placed under the same\r\nmanagement as the library of the college, the latter receiving the\r\nsociety taxes which were slightly reduced, assuming all expenses\r\nincluding the support of the reading-room, and providing for the\r\nincrease of the library by books to be annually selected by the Senior\r\nclass. Under this arrangement the different libraries have been\r\nbrought together and considered as departments of one, the hours for\r\ndrawing and consulting books have been increased from three hours per\r\nweek in the society libraries and six in the college, to twenty-one\r\nhours per week, and in many respects the facilities for use have been\r\ngreatly increased. Since 1870, the yearly additions for all the\r\nlibraries have averaged 700 volumes, and they at present contain\r\nexclusive of pamphlets about 45,000 volumes, besides nearly 5,000\r\nbooks which are either duplicates or worthless. These figures are\r\nindependent of the Astronomical library located at the Observatory,\r\nthe library of the 'Society of Inquiry,' and of the libraries of the\r\nMedical and Agricultural departments, which will probably be connected\r\nwith the main library. The library as it is now constituted is well\r\nadapted to the work of the college, and is especially so in some of\r\nthe departments of instruction, in connection with which a large\r\namount of reading is done. There are in use at present three printed\r\ncatalogues: one of the college library, printed in 1868; one of the\r\n'Social Friends' library, dated 1859; and one of the 'United\r\nFraternity' library, issued in 1861. These are supplemented by a card\r\ncatalogue arranged under title, author, and subject.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Centennial\" celebration of the founding of the college, at the\r\nCommencement of 1869, was a season of rare interest and profit to the\r\nvery large number of alumni and friends of the college assembled from\r\nnearly every quarter of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe following is the substance of the address of Chief Justice Chase,\r\nwho presided on the occasion, as given by Mr. William H. Duncan:\r\n\r\n\"He began by alluding to the fact that the college received its\r\ncharter from 'our right trusty and well beloved John Wentworth,\r\nGovernor of the Province of New Hampshire,' and said that the\r\nvenerable name was 'borne, to-day, by an honored citizen of\r\nIllinois,[36] who, like his ancestor, towered head and shoulders above\r\nhis fellow men. He also happily referred to the descendants of the\r\nother founders of the college. 'When the college was organized the\r\nthird George was heir to the British throne. Under the great Empress\r\nCatherine, Russia was prosecuting that career of aggrandizement then\r\nbegun which is even now menacing British empire in the East. Under the\r\nfifteenth Louis, in France, that wonderful literary movement was in\r\nprogress, which prepared a sympathetic enthusiasm for liberty in\r\nAmerica, at length overthrowing, for a time, monarchy in France. China\r\nand Japan were wholly outside the modern community of nations. A\r\nhundred years have passed, and what a new order has arisen! Great\r\nBritain has lost an empire, has gained other empires in Asia and\r\nAustralia, and extends her dominion around the globe. France, so great\r\nin arts and arms, has seen an empire rise and fall and another empire\r\narise, in which a wise and skillful ruler is seeking to reconcile\r\npersonal supremacy with democratic ideas. Russia, our old friend,\r\nseems to withdraw, for the present, at least, her eager gaze from\r\nConstantinople and seeks to establish herself on the Pacific Ocean and\r\nin Central Asia. China sends one of our own citizens, Mr. Burlingame,\r\non an embassy throughout the world to establish peaceful, commercial,\r\nand industrial relations with all the civilized nations. Japan, too,\r\nawakes to the necessity of a more liberal policy, and looks toward a\r\npartnership in modern civilization. Who, seeing this, and reflecting\r\non the manifold agencies at work in the old world and the prodigious\r\nmovements in the new, which I cannot even glance at, can help\r\nexclaiming, in the language of the first telegraphic message which was\r\nsent to America, 'What hath God wrought?' How great a part has this\r\ncollege, antedating the Republic, played in all the enterprises of\r\nAmerica! It has been well said of it that three quarters of the globe\r\nknow the graduates of Dartmouth. Every State in the Union, certainly,\r\nis familiar with their names and their works, and the influence which\r\nthey exert is the influence of this college. What an insignificant\r\nbeginning was that which has been described, to-day;--what splendid\r\nprogress! How great the present, and who can predict the future?\r\nNinety-eight classes of young men have already gone forth from this\r\ninstitution. Who can measure the religious, the moral, the\r\nintellectual, the political influence, which they have exerted? Great\r\nnames like Webster and Choate rise at once to memory, but I refer more\r\nparticularly to the mighty influence exerted by the vast numbers,\r\nunrecognized upon the theatre of national reputation, which the\r\ncollege has sent into all the spheres of activity and duty. When I\r\nthink of the vast momentum for good which has originated here, and is\r\nnow in unchecked progress, and must extend beyond all the limits of\r\nconception, I cannot help feeling that it is a great and precious\r\nprivilege to be in some way identified as a member of this college. It\r\ndoes not diminish my satisfaction that other graduates of other\r\nAmerican colleges can say the same thing. It rather increases the\r\nsatisfaction. Glad and thankful that my name is in the list of those\r\nwho have been educated here, and have endeavored to do something for\r\ntheir country and their kind, I rejoice that, under our beneficent\r\ninstitutions, legions of Americans have the same or greater cause for\r\ngladness.'\r\n\r\n      [36] Hon. John Wentworth, LL. D.\r\n\r\n\"After some remarks to the graduating class, the Chief Justice said:\r\n'And let me add, my brethren of the alumni, a practical word to you.\r\nWe celebrate to-day the founding of our college. We come hither to\r\ntestify our veneration and our affection for our benign Alma Mater. We\r\ncan hardly think she is a hundred years old, she looks so fresh and so\r\nfair. We are sure that many, many blessed days are before her, but a\r\nmother's days are made happy and delightful by the love and\r\nfaithfulness of her children. Much has been done for this institution,\r\nrecently, much which makes our hearts glad. The names of the\r\nbenefactors of the institution, mentioned here to-day, dwell freshly\r\nin the hearts of every graduate, and will live forever; but let us\r\nremember, that while much has been done, much also remains to be done.\r\nI do not appeal to you for charity. I wish that every graduate may\r\nfeel that the college is, in a most true and noble sense, his mother,\r\nand to remind you of your filial obligations.'\"\r\n\r\nAddresses having been made by Hon. Ira Perley, LL. D., Hon. Daniel\r\nClark, and Richard B. Kimball, Esq., Mr. Duncan says:\r\n\r\n\"Judge Chase called upon Judge Barrett, Vice President of the\r\nAssociation of the Alumni, to read a poem, which had been furnished\r\nfor the occasion by George Kent, Esq., of the Class of 1814. He had\r\nread but a few stanzas when the rumbling of distant thunder was heard.\r\nThen came a few scattering drops of water pattering upon the roof of\r\nthe tent, but soon the winds blew, and the rain descended and fell\r\nupon the roof, as if the very windows of heaven had been opened. There\r\nfollowed such a scene as no tongue, nor pen, nor pencil can\r\ndescribe,--it baffles all description. Judge Barrett, with the true\r\npluck of an Ethan Allen, stood by his colors, and the more the wind\r\nblew and the storm raged, the louder he read his poetry. But he was\r\nobliged at length to cease, and with his slouched hat and dripping\r\ngarments left the stage.\r\n\r\n\"But he was not alone in his misery. The manly and stately form of the\r\nChief Justice, the president of the college, reverend doctors of\r\ndivinity, were all in the same condition--they all stood drenched and\r\ndripping, like fountains, in the rain. Even General Sherman had to\r\nsuccumb, once in his life, and seek the protection of an umbrella.\r\nSome huddled under umbrellas, some held benches over their heads, and\r\nsome crept beneath the platform.\r\n\r\n\"The storm passed over, and Judge Barrett came forward and finished\r\nreading the poem.\r\n\r\n\"Hon. James W. Patterson, of the Class of 1848, was then called upon,\r\nand spoke with force and eloquence, receiving the greatest compliment\r\nthat could be paid him,--the undivided attention of the audience.\"\r\n\r\nAddresses were also made by Dr. Jabez B. Upham, Samuel H. Taylor, LL.\r\nD., Rev. Samuel C. Bartlett, D.D., and others.\r\n\r\nWe quote some of the closing passages of the \"Historical Address\" by\r\nPresident Brown, of Hamilton College.\r\n\r\n\"There is not much time to speak of the general policy of the\r\ncollege through these hundred years of its life, but I may say in\r\nbrief, that it has been sound and earnest, conservative and\r\naggressive at the same time. As the motto on its seal,--_vox clamantis\r\nin deserto_,--indicated and expressed the religious purpose of its\r\nfounders, so this purpose has never been lost sight of. Through\r\nlustrum after lustrum, and generation after generation, while classes\r\nhave succeeded classes, while one corps of instructors have passed\r\naway and others have taken their places, this high purpose of\r\npresenting and enforcing the vital and essential truths of the\r\nChristian religion, has never been forgotten or neglected. The power\r\nof Christianity in modifying, inspiring, and directing the energies of\r\nmodern civilization,--its art, its literature, its commerce, its laws,\r\nits government, has been profoundly felt. Nor has it for a moment been\r\nforgotten that education, to be truly and in the largest degree\r\nbeneficent, must also be religious,--must affect that which is deepest\r\nin man,--must lead him, if it can, to the contemplation of truths most\r\npersonal, central, and essential, must open to him some of those\r\ndepths where the soul swings almost helplessly in the midst of\r\nexperiences and powers unfathomable and infinite,--where the intellect\r\nfalters and hesitates and finds no solution of its perplexities till\r\nit yields to faith. Within later years there have been those who have\r\nadvocated the doctrine that education should be entirely\r\nsecular,--that the college should have nothing to do with religious\r\ncounsels or advice. Now while I do not think that this would be easy,\r\nas our colleges are organized, without leaving or even inciting the\r\nmind to dangerous skepticism, nor possible but by omitting the most\r\npowerful means of moral and intellectual discipline, nor without\r\ndepriving the soul of that food which it specially craves, and\r\ndestitute of which it will grow lean, hungry, and unsatisfied,--as a\r\nmatter of history, no such theory of education has found favorable\r\nresponse among the guardians of Dartmouth. At the same time while the\r\ngeneral religious character of the college has been well ascertained\r\nand widely recognized, while the great truths of our common\r\nChristianity have been fully and frankly and earnestly brought to the\r\nnotice of intelligent and inquiring minds, it has not been with a\r\nnarrow, illiberal, and proselyting spirit, not so as rudely to violate\r\ntraditionary beliefs, not so as to wound and repel any sincere and\r\ntruth loving mind. And this is the consistent and sound position for\r\nthe college to hold.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to its curriculum of studies the position of the college\r\nhas been equally wise. She has endeavored to make her course as broad,\r\ngenerous, and thorough as possible; equal to the best in the land; so\r\nthat her students could feel that no privilege has been denied them\r\nwhich any means at her disposal could provide. She has endeavored\r\nwisely to apportion the elements of instruction and discipline. She\r\nhas provided as liberally as possible, by libraries, apparatus,\r\nlaboratories, and cabinets for increase in positive knowledge. She has\r\nequally insisted on those exact studies which compel subtleness and\r\nprecision of thought, which habituate the mind to long trains of\r\ncontrolled reasoning, which discipline alike the attention and the\r\nwill, the conservative and the elaborative powers. She has given full\r\nhonor to the masterpieces of human language and human thought, through\r\nwhich, while we come to a more complete knowledge of peoples and\r\nnations, of poetry and eloquence, we feel more profoundly the life of\r\nhistory, and comprehend the changes of custom and thought, while the\r\nfiner and more subtle powers of fancy and imagination stir within the\r\nsensitive mind, and gradually by constant and imperceptible\r\ninspiration lift the soul to regions of larger beauty and freedom.\r\n\r\n\"So may she ever hold on her way, undeluded by specious promises of\r\neasier methods, inuring her students to toil as the price of success;\r\nnot rigid and motionless, but plastic and adapting herself to the\r\nnecessities of different minds; yet never confounding things that\r\ndiffer, nor vainly hoping on a narrow basis of culture to rear the\r\nsuperstructure of the broadest attainment and character, but ever\r\ndetermined to make her instructions the most truly liberal and noble.\r\n\r\n\"With no purpose of personal advantage, but with the deepest filial\r\nlove and gratitude have we assembled this day. Of all professions and\r\ncallings, from many States, from public business and from engrossing\r\nprivate pursuits,--you, my young friend who have just come, with\r\nhesitation and ingenuous fear, to add your name if you may, to the\r\nhonored rolls of the college, and you Sir,[37] whose memory runs back\r\nto the beginning of the century, the oldest or nearly the oldest\r\nliving alumnus of the college, the contemporary of Chapman and Harvey,\r\nand Fletcher, and Parris, and Weston, and Webster,--you who came from\r\nbeyond the 'Father of Waters,' and you who have retreated for a moment\r\nfrom the shore of the dark Atlantic--you Sir,[38] our brother by\r\nhearty and affectionate adoption, who led our armies in that memorable\r\nmarch from the mountain to the sea, which shall be remembered as long\r\nas the march of the Ten Thousand, and repeated in story and song as\r\nlong as history and romance shall be written, and you, Sir, who hold\r\nthe even scales of justice in that august tribunal, from which\r\nMarshall proclaimed the law which insured to us our ancient name and\r\nrights and privileges, unchanged, untarnished, unharmed,--all of us,\r\nmy brothers, with one purpose have come up to lay our trophies at the\r\nfeet of our common mother, to deck her with fresh garlands, to rejoice\r\nin her prosperity, and to promise her our perpetual homage and love.\r\nLet no word of ours ever give her pain or sorrow. Loyal to our heart\r\nof hearts, may we minister so far as we can, to her wants, may we be\r\njealous of her honor, and solicitous for her prosperity. May no\r\nruthless hand ever hereafter be lifted against her. May no unholy\r\njealousies rend the fair fabric of her seamless garment. May no narrow\r\nor unworthy spirit mar the harmony of her wise counsels. May she stand\r\nto the end as she ever has stood, for the Church and State, a glory\r\nand a defense. And above all and in order to all, may the spirit of\r\nGod in full measure rest upon her; 'the spirit of wisdom and\r\nunderstanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of\r\nknowledge and of the fear of the Lord.'\"\r\n\r\n      [37] Job Lyman, Esq., of the class of 1804.\r\n\r\n      [38] General Sherman received the highest honorary degree of the\r\n           college in 1866.\r\n\r\nPresident Smith, whose character was a rare union of energy and\r\ngentleness, was preëminently a man of affairs.\r\n\r\nThe results of his untiring efforts to promote the welfare of the\r\ncollege, in various directions, will be more fully developed upon\r\nsubsequent pages. Having performed valuable service for thirteen\r\nyears, he resigned his office, on account of failing health, March 1,\r\n1877, and died on the sixteenth of August following, his wife, Mrs.\r\nSarah Ann (Adams) Smith, surviving him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nINAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT BARTLETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. Samuel C. Bartlett, D.D., of the Chicago Theological Seminary,\r\nwas elected the eighth president of the college. We insert entire his\r\ninaugural address, delivered at the Commencement, June, 1877:\r\n\r\n\"Certain occasions seem to prescribe their own themes of discourse,\r\nand certain themes are endowed with perpetual life. There are problems\r\nwith which each coming generation and each last man grapples as\r\nfreshly as the first.\r\n\r\n\"How shall the ripest growth of the ages be imparted to one young\r\nsoul? Twice, at least, in a lifetime, is this great question wont to\r\nrise solemnly before each thoughtful man--when he looks forward in\r\nyouthful hope, and when he looks back in parental solicitude. It is a\r\nquestion of many forms and multiplying answers. Shall there be a long,\r\nfundamental training, wide and general? or, shall it be closely\r\nprofessional? Shall it be predominantly classic, or scientific, or\r\nesthetic, or empiric? Many, or much? For accomplishment, or for\r\naccomplishing? Shall it fit for the tour of Europe, or for the journey\r\nof life? Masculine and feminine, or vaguely human? Shall it rattle\r\nwith the drum-beat, bound with gymnastics, court fame by excursive\r\n\"nines\" not known on Helicon, and challenge British Oxford, alas? with\r\nits boat crew? Shall the American College student follow his option,\r\nor his curriculum? And shall the college itself be a school for\r\nschoolmasters, a collection of debating clubs, a reading-room with\r\nlibrary attached, an intellectual quarantine for the plague of riches?\r\nor, a place of close and protracted drill, of definite methods, of\r\nprescribed intellectual work? Shall it fulfill the statement of the\r\nConcord sage,--'You send your son to the schoolmasters, and the\r\nschoolboys educate him?' or, shall a strong faculty make and mark the\r\nwhole tone of the institution?\r\n\r\n\"In these and other forms is the same fundamental question still\r\nthrust sharply before us. I do not propose to move directly on such a\r\nline of bristling bayonets, but to make my way by a flank movement\r\nacross this \"wilderness\" of conflict. It will go far towards\r\ndetermining the methods of a liberal education, if we first ascertain,\r\nas I propose to do, The Chief Elements of a Manly Culture.\r\n\r\n\"Obviously the primal condition of all else must be found in a\r\nself-prompted activity or wakefulness of intellect. The time when the\r\ndrifting faculties begin to feel the helm of will, when the youth\r\npasses from being merely receptive to become aggressive, marks the\r\nadvent of the true human era. As in the history of our planet the\r\nfirst remove from the _tohu va-vohu_ was when the Spirit of God\r\nbrooded on the deep, and, obedient to the command, light shot out from\r\ndarkness, so in man the microcosm, the brooding spirit and commanding\r\npurpose mark the first step from chaos toward cosmos. The mechanical\r\nintellect becomes dynamical, and the automatic man becomes autonomic.\r\nIt may be with a lower or a higher motion. The mind gropes round\r\nrestlessly by a yearning instinct; it may be driven by the strong\r\nimpulse of native genius; or, it may rise to the condition of being\r\nthe facile servant of the forceful will. When the boy at Pisa\r\ncuriously watches the oil lamp swinging by its long chain in the\r\ncathedral, a pendulum begins to vibrate in his brain, and falling\r\nbodies to count off their intervals; and when afterward he\r\ndeliberately fits two lenses in a leaden tube, the moon's mountains,\r\nJupiter's satellites, and Saturn's rings are all waiting to catch his\r\neye. A thoughtful meditation on the spasms of a dead frog's leg in\r\nBologna becomes galvanic. The gas breaking on the surface of a brewery\r\nvat, well watched by Priestley, bursts forth into pneumatic chemistry.\r\nA spider's web in the Duke of Devonshire's garden expands in the mind\r\nof my lord's gardener, Brown, into a suspension bridge. A sledge\r\nhammer, well swung in Cromarty, opened those New Walks in an Old\r\nField. The diffraction of light revealed itself to Young in the hues\r\nof a soap-bubble. As the genie of the oriental tale unfolded his huge\r\nheight from the bottle stamped with Solomon's seal, so the career of\r\nDavy first evolved itself out of old vials and gallipots. When the boy\r\nBowditch was found in all his leisure moments snatching up his slate\r\nand pencil, when Cobbett grappled resolutely with the grammar, when\r\nCuvier dissected the cuttlefish found upon the shore, or Scott was\r\nseen sitting on a ladder, hour after hour, poring over books, they\r\nwill be further heard from.\r\n\r\n\"If such instances illustrate the propulsive force of native genius,\r\nthey also indicate what training must do when the impulsive genius is\r\nnot there. No idler plea was ever entered for an idler than when he\r\nsays,--'I have no bent for this, no interest in that, and no genius\r\nfor the other.' The animal has his _habitat_, and stays fast. A\r\ncomplete man is intellectually and physically a cosmopolite. Till he\r\nhas gained the power to throw his will-force wherever the work summons\r\nhim, most of all to the weak points of his condition, till he has\r\nlearned to be his own task-master and overseer, he is but a 'slave of\r\nthe ring.'\r\n\r\n\"In most lines the highest gift is the gift of toil. Indeed, men of\r\ngenius have often been the most terrible of toilers, and in the\r\nregions of highest art. How have the great masters of music first\r\nwelded the keys of the organ and harpsichord to their fingers' ends\r\nand their souls' nerves before they poured forth the Creation or the\r\nMessiah, the symphonies and sonatas! Think of Meyerbeer and his\r\nfifteen hours of daily work; of Mozart's incessant study of the\r\nmasters, and his own eight hundred compositions in his short life; of\r\nMendelssohn's nine years elaboration of Elijah. Or in the sister art,\r\nhow we track laborious, continuous study in the Peruginesque, the\r\nFlorentine, and the Roman styles successively of Raphael, and in the\r\nincredible activity that crowded a life of thirty-seven years with\r\nsuch a vast number of portraits and Madonnas, of altar-pieces and\r\nfrescoes, mythological, historical, and Biblical. And that still\r\ngrander contemporary genius, how he wrought by night with the candle\r\nin his pasteboard cap, how he had dissected and studied the human\r\nframe like an anatomist or surgeon before he chiseled the David and\r\nMoses, or painted the Sistine chapel, and how the plannings of his\r\nbusy brain were always in advance of the powers of a hand that, till\r\nthe age of eighty-eight, was incessantly at work.\r\n\r\n\"The servant is not above his master. The lower intellect can buy at\r\nno cheaper price than the higher, and the hour of full intellectual\r\nemancipation comes only when the student has learned to serve--to turn\r\nthe whole freshness and sharpness of his intellect on any needful\r\ntheme of the hour; it may be the scale of a fossil fish, or the annual\r\nmovement of a glacier, the disclosures of the spectrum, or the secrets\r\nof the arrow-headed tongue. All great explorers have been largely\r\ntheir own teachers, and each young scholar has made the best use of\r\nall helps and helpers when he has learned to teach himself. His\r\nemancipation, once fairly purchased, confers on him potentially the\r\nfreedom of the empire of thought; and, as evermore, the freeman toils\r\nharder than the slave. The strong stimulus of such a self-moved\r\nactivity, thoroughly aroused, becomes in Choate or Gladstone the\r\nfountain of perpetual youth, and forms the solid basis of the titanic\r\nscholarship of Germany. It stood embodied in the life and motto of the\r\naged, matchless artist Angelo,--'_Ancora imparo_,' I am learning\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n\"But impulse and activity may move blindly. Another cardinal quality\r\nof such a culture, therefore, must be precision--the close, clean\r\nworking of the faculties. A memory trained to clear recollection, what\r\na saving of reiterated labor and of annoying helplessness. A\r\ndiscrimination sharpened to the nicest discernment of things that\r\ndiffer, though always a shining mark for the arrow of the satirist,\r\nwill outlive all shots with his gray-goose shaft; for it shines with\r\nthe gleam of tempered steel. An exactness of knowledge that defines\r\nall its landmarks, how is it master of the situation. A precision of\r\nspeech, born of clear thinking, what controversial battlefields of\r\nsulphurous smoke and scattering fire might it prevent. He has been\r\ncalled a public benefactor who makes two blades of grass grow where\r\none grew before. He is as great a benefactor, who in an age of\r\nverbiage makes one word perform the function of two. Wonderful is the\r\nprecision with which this mental mechanism may be made to work. Some\r\nmen can even think their best on their feet in the presence of a great\r\nassembly. There are others whose spontaneous thoughts move by informal\r\nsyllogisms. Emmons sometimes laid off his common utterances like the\r\nheads of a discourse. Johnson's retorts exploded like a musket, and\r\noften struck like a musket-ball. John Hunter fairly compared his own\r\nmind to a bee-hive, all in a hum, but the hum of industry and order\r\nand achievement. It reminds us, by contrast, of other minds formed\r\nupon the model of the wasp's nest, with a superabundance of hum and\r\nsting without, and no honey within. It was of the voluminous works of\r\na distinguished author that Robert Hall remarked,--'They are a\r\ncontinent of mud, sir.' Nuisances of literature are the men who fill\r\nthe air with smoke, relieved by no clear blaze of light. There have\r\nbeen schools of thought that were as smoky as Pittsburg. We have had\r\n'seers' who made others see nothing, men of 'insight' with no outlook,\r\nscientists who in every critical argument jumped the track of true\r\nscience, and preachers whose hazy thoughts and utterances flickered\r\nbetween truth and error. Pity there were not some intellectual\r\nSing-Sing for the culprit!\r\n\r\n\"How refreshing, on the other hand, to follow the clear unfolding of\r\nthe silken threads of thought that lie side by side, single and in\r\nknots and skeins, but never tangled. What a beautiful process was an\r\ninvestigation by Faraday in electro-magnetism, as he combined his\r\napparatus, manipulated his material, narrowed his search, eliminated\r\nhis sources of error, and drew his careful conclusions. With similar\r\npersistent acuteness, in the field of Biblical investigation, how does\r\nZumpt, by an exhaustive exclusion and combination, at length make the\r\nannals of Tacitus shake hands with the gospel of Luke over the taxing\r\nof Cyrenius. In metaphysics, how matchless the razor-like acuteness\r\nwith which Hamilton could distinguish, divide, and clear up the\r\nquestions that lay piled in confused heaps over the subject of\r\nperception. What can be more admirable than the workings of the\r\ntrained legal or rather judicial mind, as it walks firmly through\r\nlabyrinths of statute and precedent and principle, holding fast its\r\nstrong but tenuous thread, till it stands forth in the bright light of\r\nday;--it may be some Sir John Jervis, unraveling in a criminal case\r\nthe web of sophistries with which a clever counsel has bewildered a\r\njury; or it may be Marshall or Story, in our own college case,\r\nshredding away, one by one, its intricacies, entanglements, and\r\naccretions, till all is delightfully, restfully clear.\r\n\r\n\"It is a trait all the more to be insisted on in these very times,\r\nbecause there is so strong a drift toward a seeming clearness which is\r\na real confusion. By two opposite methods do men now seek to reach\r\nthat underlying order and majestic simplicity which more and more\r\nappear to mark this universe. The one distinguishes, the other\r\nconfounds, things that certainly differ. The one system belongs to the\r\nreality and grandeur of nature, the other to the pettiness and\r\nperverseness of man. Not a few seem bent on seeing simplicity and\r\nuniformity by the short process of shutting their eyes upon actual\r\ndiversity. They proceed not by analytical incision, but by summary\r\nexcision. They work with the cleaver and not with the scalpel. What\r\nsingular denials of the intuitive facts of universal consciousness,\r\nwhat summary identifications of most palpable diversities, and what\r\nkangaroo-leaps beyond the high wall of their facts, mark many of the\r\ndeliverances of those who loudly warn us off from 'the unknowable!'\r\nWhat shall we say of the steady confusion, in some arguments, of\r\nstructure and function, and of force with material? When men, however\r\neminent, openly propose to identify the force which screws together\r\ntwo plates of metal with the agency which corrodes or dissolves both\r\nin an acid, or to identify the affinity that forms chemical\r\ncombinations with the vitality that so steadily overrides, suspends,\r\nand counteracts those affinities, is this an ascent into the pure\r\nether, or a plunge in the Cimmerian dark? When, in opposition to every\r\npossible criterion, a man claims that there is but 'one ultimate form\r\nof matter out of which successively the more complex forms of matter\r\nare built up,' is this the advance march of chemistry, or the\r\nretrograde to alchemy? When a writer, in a style however lucid and\r\ntaking, firmly assumes that there is no essential difference in\r\nobjects alike in material elements, but separated by that mighty and\r\nmysterious thing, _life_, is that the height of wisdom, or the depth\r\nof folly? And how such a central paralysis of the mental retina\r\nspreads its darkness, as, for example, in the affirmation that as\r\noxygen and hydrogen are reciprocally convertible with water, so are\r\nwater, ammonia, and carbolic acid convertible into and resolvable from\r\nliving protoplasm!--a statement said to be as false in chemistry as it\r\ncertainly is in physiology. An ordinary merchant's accountant will, if\r\nneed be, work a week to correct in his trial balance the variation of\r\na cent. But when he listens to Sir John Lubbock calmly reckoning the\r\nage of the human implements in the valley of the Somme at from one\r\nhundred thousand up to two hundred and forty thousand years; when he\r\nsees Croll, in dating the close of the glacial age, leap down from the\r\nheight of near eight hundred thousand to eighty thousand years; when\r\nhe finds Darwin and Lyell claiming for the period of life on the earth\r\nmore than three hundred millions of years, while Tait and Thompson\r\npronounce it 'utterly impossible' to grant more than ten, or, at most,\r\nfifteen millions,--this poor, benighted clerk is bound to sit and\r\nhearken to his masters in all outward solemnity, but he must be\r\nexcused for a prolonged inward smile. Who are these, he says, that\r\nreckon with a lee-way of hundreds of thousands of years, and fling the\r\nhundreds of millions of years right and left, like pebbles and straws?\r\n\r\n\"Brilliancy, so-called, is no equivalent or substitute for precision.\r\nIt is often its worst enemy. A man may mould himself to think in\r\ncurves and zig-zags, and not in right lines. He sends never an arrow,\r\nbut a boomerang. Or he thinks in poetry instead of prose, deals in\r\nanalogy where it should be analysis, puts rhetoric for logic, scatters\r\nand not concentrates, and while he radiates never irradiates. A late\r\ndivine was suspected of heresy, partly because of his poetic bias; and\r\none of his volumes was unfortunate for him and his readers, in that\r\nfor his central position he planted himself on a figure of speech, and\r\nnot on a logical proposition. The well-known story _se non vero e ben\r\ntrovato_, of that keenest of lawyers, listening to a lecture of which\r\nevery sentence was a gem and every paragraph rich with the spoils of\r\nliterature, and replying to the question, \"Do you understand all\r\nthat?\" \"No, but my daughters do.\" It was as beautiful and iridescent\r\nas the Staubbach, and as impalpable.\r\n\r\n\"The more is the pity when a vigorous mind, in the outset of some\r\ngreat discussion, heads for a fog-bank or a wind-mill. When a man\r\nproposes to chronicle a 'Conflict between Religion and Science,' and\r\nmakes religion stand indiscriminately for Romanism, Mohammedanism,\r\nsuperstition, malignant passion, obstinate prejudice, and what not,\r\nalso confounding Christianity with so-called Christians, and those\r\noften most unrepresentative,--at the same time appropriating to\r\n'Science' all intellectual activity whatever, though found in good\r\nChristian men, and though fostered and made irrepressible by the fire\r\nof that very religion, it is easy to see what must be the outcome of\r\nsuch a sweepstakes race. There will be a deification of science, and\r\nnot even a whited sepulchre erected over the measureless Golgothas of\r\nits slaughtered theories. There will be, on the other hand, the steady\r\n_suppressio veri_ concerning books, systems, men, and events, the\r\noccasional though unintended _assertio falsi_, the eager conversion of\r\ntheories into facts, constructions unfair and uncandid and,\r\nthroughout, with much that is bright and just, that 'admixture of a\r\nlie that doth ever add pleasure' to its author and grief to the\r\njudicious. Such confusions are no doubt often the outgrowth of the\r\nwill. But a main end of a true culture is to prevent or expose all\r\nsuch bewilderments, whether helpless or crafty.\r\n\r\n\"The great predominance of the disciplinary process was what once\r\ncharacterized the English university system even more than now. It\r\nconsisted in the exact and exhaustive mastery of certain limited\r\nsections of knowledge and thought, as the gymnastic for all other\r\nspheres and toils. At Oxford, not long ago, four years were spent in\r\nmastering some fourteen books. Whatever may be our criticism of the\r\nprocess, we may not deny its singular effect. In its best estate it\r\nforged many a trenchant blade. To the man who asks for its monument,\r\nit can point to British thought, law, statesmanship. Bacon and Burke,\r\nCoke and Eldon, Hooker and Butler, Pitt and Canning, shall make\r\nanswer. The whole massive literature of England shall respond.\r\n\r\n\"But to this precision of working must be furnished material with\r\nwhich to work. Mental fullness is, therefore, another prime quality of\r\na manly culture. To what degree it should be sought in the curriculum\r\nhas been in dispute. It is the American theory, and a growing belief\r\nof the English nation, that the British universities have been\r\ndefective here. Their men of mark have traveled later over the broader\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n\"Provincialism of intellect is a calamity. All men of great\r\nachievements have had to know what others achieved. The highest\r\nmonuments are always built with the spoils of the past. Any single\r\ngenius, if not an infinitesimal, counts at most but a digit in the\r\nvast notation of humanity. The great masters have been the greatest\r\nscholars. Many a bright mind has struggled alone to beat the air.\r\nBehold in some national patent-office a grand mummy-pit of ignorant\r\ninventors.\r\n\r\n\"Those men upon whom so much opprobrium has been heaped, the\r\nSchoolmen, were unfortunate chiefly in the lack of material on which\r\nto expend their singular acuteness. Leibnitz was not ashamed to\r\nconfess his obligations to them, nor South to avail himself of their\r\nsubtle distinctions. Doubtless theology owes them a debt. Some of them\r\nhave been well called, by Hallam, men 'of extraordinary powers of\r\ndiscrimination and argument, strengthened in the long meditation of\r\ntheir cloister by the extinction of every other talent and the\r\nexclusion of every other pursuit. Their age and condition denied them\r\nthe means of studying polite letters, of observing nature, or of\r\nknowing mankind. They were thus driven back upon themselves, cut off\r\nfrom all the material on which the mind could operate, and doomed to\r\nemploy all their powers in defense of what they must never presume to\r\nexamine.' 'If these Schoolmen,' says Bacon, 'to their great thirst of\r\ntruth and unwearied travel of wit had joined variety of reading and\r\ncontemplation, they had proved great lights to the advancement of all\r\nlearning and knowledge.' And so, for lack of other timber, they split\r\nhairs. Hence the mass of ponderous trifling that has made their name a\r\nby-word. A force, sometimes Herculean, was spent in building and\r\ndemolishing castles of moonshine.\r\n\r\n\"A robust mental strength requires various and solid food. The best\r\ngrowth is symmetrical. There is a common bond--_quoddam commune\r\nvinculum_--in the circle of knowledge, that cannot be overlooked. Men\r\ndo not know best what they know only in its isolation. Even Kant\r\noffset his metaphysics by lecturing on geography; and Niebuhr, the\r\nhistorian, struggled hard and well to keep his equilibrium by throwing\r\nhimself into the whole circle of natural science and of affairs. Such,\r\nalso, are the interdependencies of scholarship, that ample knowledge\r\nwithout our specialty is needful to save us from blunders within.\r\nOlshausen was a brilliant commentator, and the slightest tinge of\r\nchemistry should have kept him from suggesting that the conversion of\r\nwater into wine at Cana was but the acceleration of a natural process.\r\nA smattering of optics would have prevented Dr. Williams from\r\nrepeating the old cavil of Voltaire, that light could not have been\r\nmade before the sun. A moderate reflection upon the laws of speech and\r\nthe method of Genesis would have restrained Huxley from sneering at\r\nthe 'marvelous flexibility' of the Hebrew tongue in the word 'day,'\r\nand a New York audience from laughing at the joke rather than the\r\njoker. Some tinge of ethical knowledge should have withheld Max Müller\r\nfrom finding the grand distinctive mark of humanity in the power of\r\nspeech. The merest theorist needs some range of reality for the\r\nframework of his theories, and the man of broad principles must have\r\nfacts to generalize. Indeed, a good memory is the indispensable\r\nservant of large thought, and however deficient in certain directions,\r\nthe great thinkers have had large stores. 'The best heads that have\r\never existed,' says an idealist,--'Pericles, Plato, Julius Cæsar,\r\nShakespeare, Goethe, Milton,--were well read, universally educated\r\nmen, and quite too wise to undervalue letters. Their opinion has\r\nweight, because they had the means of knowing the opposite opinion.'\r\n\r\n\"While every year increases the impossibility of what used to be\r\ncalled universal knowledge, it also emphasizes the necessity of a\r\nscholarship that has its outlook toward all the vast provinces of\r\nreading and thought. It cannot conquer them, but it can be on treaty\r\nrelations with them. The tendency of modern science is, of necessity,\r\nsteadily toward sectional lines and division of labor. It is a\r\ntendency whose cramping influence is as steadily to be resisted, even\r\nin later life, much more in early training. We are to form ourselves\r\non the model of the integer rather than the fraction of humanity. The\r\nmetaphysician cannot afford to be ignorant of the 'chemistry of a\r\ncandle' or the 'history of a piece of chalk,' nor the chemist of the\r\nlaws of language, the theologian of astronomy and geology, nor the\r\nlawyer of the most ancient code and its history. Mill himself made\r\ncomplaint of Comte's 'great aberration' in ignoring psychology and\r\nlogic.\r\n\r\n\"Intellectual fetichism is born of isolation, and dies hard. While in\r\nthe great modern uprising we may boast that the heathen idols have\r\nbeen swept away from three hundred dark islands of Polynesia, new\r\n'idols of the cave' stalk forth upon the world of civilized thought.\r\nWe are just now much bewildered with brightness in streaks, which\r\nfalls on us like the sunlight from a boy's bit of glass, and blinds\r\nour eyes instead of showing our path. Half-educated persons seize\r\nfragments of principles and snatch at half-truths. Crotchets infest\r\nthe brains, and hobbies career through the fields of thought.\r\nPolyphemus is after us, a burly wretch with one eye. Better if _that_\r\nwere out.\r\n\r\n\"The remedy is, to correct our narrowness by a clear view of the wide\r\nexpanse. We must come out of our cave. We must link our pursuits to\r\nthose of humanity. Breadth and robustness given to the mental\r\nconstitution in its early training shall go far through life to save\r\nus from partial paralysis or monstrosity.\r\n\r\n\"To insure this result, however, we must add to that fullness of\r\nmaterial the quality of mental equipoise or mastery, the power of\r\ngrasping and managing it all. A man is to possess, and not to be\r\n'possessed with,' his acquisitions. He wants an intellect decisive,\r\nincisive, and, if I might coin a word, concisive.\r\n\r\n\"The power to unify and organize must go with all right acquisition.\r\nKnowledges must be changed to knowledge. It takes force to handle\r\nweight. Some men seem to know more than is healthy for them. It does\r\nnot make muscle, but becomes plethoric, dropsical, adipose, or\r\nadipocere. Better to have thought more and acquired less. Frederick W.\r\nRobertson, in his prime, wrote,--'I will answer for it that there are\r\nfew girls of eighteen who have not read more books than I have;' and\r\nMrs. Browning confessed,--'I should be wiser if I had not read half as\r\nmuch;' while old Hobbes, of Malmesbury, caustically remarked,--'If I\r\nhad read as much as other men I should know as little.' It may serve\r\nas a hint to the omnivorous college student. Cardinal Mezzofanti knew,\r\nit is said, more than a hundred languages. What came of it all? A\r\neulogy on one Emanuele da Ponte. He never said anything in all the\r\nlanguages he spoke! What constitutes the life of an intellectual\r\njelly-fish? Even the brilliancy of Macaulay was almost overweighted by\r\nthe immensity of his acquisitions. The vivid glitter of details in his\r\nmemory may sometimes have dazzled his perception of a _tout ensemble_,\r\nand for principles it was his manner to cite precedents. A multitude\r\nof lesser lights have been almost smothered by superabundance of fuel.\r\nA man knows Milton almost by heart, and Shakespeare too, can quote\r\npages of Homer, has read Chrysostom for his recreation, is full of\r\nhistory, runs over with statistics right and left, and withal is\r\nstrong in mother-wit. But the mother-wit proves not strong enough,\r\nperhaps, to push forth and show itself over the ponderous débris above\r\nit, the enormousness, or, if you please, the enormity of his\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n\"It requires a first-class mind to carry a vast load of scientific\r\nfacts. Hence the many eminent observers who have been the most\r\nillogical of reasoners. What a contrast between Hugh Miller and his\r\nfriend Francia; the mind of the latter, as Miller describes it, 'a\r\nlabyrinth without a clew, in whose recesses was a vast amount of\r\nbook-knowledge that never could be used, and was of no use to himself\r\nor any one else;' the former wielding all his stores as he swung his\r\nsledge. What is wanted is the comprehensive hand, and not the\r\nprehensile tail.\r\n\r\n\"Involved in such an equipoise is the decisiveness, the willforce,\r\nthat not only holds, but holds the balance. Common as it may be, it is\r\nnone the less pitiable to be just acute enough constantly to question,\r\nbut not to answer--forever to raise difficulties, and never to solve\r\nthem. Wakeful, but the wakefulness of weakliness. Fine-strung minds\r\nare they often, acquisitive, subtle, and sensitive, able to look all\r\naround their labyrinth and see far into darkness, but not out to the\r\nlight. It is by nature rather a German than an Anglo-Saxon habit. It\r\nis not always fatal even there. De Wette, 'the veteran doubter,'\r\nrallied at the last, and, like Bunyan's Feeble-mind, went over almost\r\nshouting. In this country, youth often have it somewhat later than the\r\nmeasles and the small-pox, and come through very well, without even a\r\npock-mark. Sometimes it becomes epidemic, and assumes a languid or\r\ntyphoidal cast,--not Positivism, but Agnosticism. It is rather\r\nfashionable to eulogize perplexity and doubt as a mark of strength and\r\ngenius. But whatever may be the passing fashion, the collective\r\njudgment of the ages has settled it that the permanent state of mental\r\nhesitancy and indecision, in whatever sphere of thought and action, is\r\nand must be a false condition. It indicates the scrofulous diathesis,\r\nand calls for more iron in the blood. It is a lower type of manhood.\r\nIt abdicates the province of a human intelligence, which is to seek\r\nand find truth. It abrogates the moral obligation to prove all things,\r\nand hold fast that which is good. It revolts from the great problem of\r\nlife, which calls on us to know, and to know that we may do. Out upon\r\nthis apotheosis of doubt. It is the sick man glorying in his\r\ninfirmity, the beggar boasting of his intellectual rags.\r\n\r\n\"The comprehensive and decisive tend naturally to the incisive. The\r\npower to take a subject by its handle and poise it on its centre is\r\nperhaps the consummation of merely intellectual culture. When all its\r\nnutriment has been converted into bone and muscle and sinew and nerve,\r\nthen the mind bounds to its work, lithe and strong, like a hunting\r\nleopard on its game. It was exactly the power with which our Webster\r\nhandled his case, till it seemed to the farmer too simple to require a\r\ngreat man to argue. It was the quality that Lincoln so toiled at\r\nthrough his early manhood, and so admirably gained,--the power of\r\npresenting things clearly to 'plain people.' You may call it 'the art\r\nof putting things,' but it is the art of conceiving things. It is no\r\ntrick of style, but a character of thinking, and it marks the\r\nharvest-time of a manly culture.\r\n\r\n\"I will add to this enumeration one other quality, one without which\r\nthis harvest will not ripen. I speak of mental docility and reverence.\r\nA man will have looked forth to little purpose on the universe if he\r\ndoes not see that, even with his expanding circle of light, there is\r\nan ever-enlarging circle of darkness around it. He will have compared\r\nhis achievements with those of the race to little profit, if he does\r\nnot recognize his relative insignificance, gathering sands on the\r\nocean shore.\r\n\r\n\"The wide range and rapid outburst of modern learning tend undoubtedly\r\nto arrogance and conceit. We gleefully traverse our new strip of\r\ndomain, and ask, Were there ever such beings as we? Yes, doubtless\r\nthere were,--clearer, greater, and nobler. Wisdom, skill, and strength\r\nwere not born with us. All the qualities of manly thought, though with\r\nruder implements and cruder materials, have been as conspicuously\r\nexhibited down through the ages past as in our day. The power of\r\ngoverning, ability in war, diplomacy in peace, subtle dialectics,\r\nclear insight, the art of conversation, persuasive and impressive\r\nspeech, high art in every form, whatever constitutes the test of good\r\nmanhood, has been here in full force. It would puzzle us yet to lay\r\nthe stones of Baalbec, or to carve, move, and set up the great statue\r\nof Rameses. Within a generation, Euclid of Alexandria was teaching\r\ngeometry in Dartmouth College, and Heraclides and Aristarchus\r\nanticipated Copernicus by sixteen centuries. No man has surpassed the\r\nsculptures of Rhodes, or the paintings of the sixteenth century. The\r\ncathedral of Cologne is the offspring of forgotten brains. Such men as\r\nAnselm were educated on the Trivium and Quadrivium. Five hundred years\r\nago Merton College could show such men as Geoffrey Chaucer, William of\r\nOccam, and John Wickliffe. If the history of science can produce four\r\nbrighter contemporary names than Napier, Kepler, Descartes, and\r\nGalileo, let them be forthcoming. But when, still earlier by a\r\ncentury and a half, we behold a man who was not only architect,\r\nengineer, and sculptor, and in painting the rival of Angelo, but who,\r\nas Hallam proves, 'anticipated in the compass of a few pages the\r\ndiscoveries which made Galileo, Kepler, Maestlin, Maurolycus, and\r\nCastelli immortal,' it may well 'strike us,' he suggests 'with\r\nsomething like the awe of supernatural knowledge;' and in the presence\r\nof Leonardo da Vinci the modern scientist of highest rank may stand\r\nwith uncovered head.\r\n\r\n\"If wisdom was not born with us, neither will it die with us. There\r\nwill be something left to know. Our facts will be tested, our theories\r\nprobed, and our assertions exploded by better minds than ours. If it\r\nbe true, as Bacon says, '_prudens interrogatio dimidium scientiæ_,' it\r\nis also true, '_imprudens assertio excidium scientiæ_.' We are in\r\nthese days treated to 'demonstrations' which scarcely rise to the\r\nlevel of presumptions, but, rather, of presumption. There is an\r\naccumulation of popular dogmatism that is very likely doomed within a\r\ncentury to be swept into the same oblivion with the 'Christian\r\nAstrology,' of William Lilly and the 'Ars Magna' of Raymond Lully--a\r\nmass of rubbish that is waiting for another Caliph Omar and the\r\nbath-fires of Alexandria.\r\n\r\n\"It will not answer to mistake the despotism of hypothesis for the\r\nreign of law, nor physical law for the great 'I AM.' True thinkers\r\nmust respect other thinkers and God. They cannot ignore the primal\r\nutterances of consciousness, the laws of logic, nor the truths of\r\nhistory. Foregone conclusions are not to bar out the deepest facts of\r\nhuman nature, nor the most stupendous events in the story of the race.\r\nHume may not rule out the settled laws of evidence the moment they\r\ntouch the borders of religion; nor may Strauss, by the simple\r\nassertion that miracles are impossible, manacle the arm of God. Comte\r\nmay not put his extinguisher upon the great underlying verities of our\r\nbeing, nor Tyndall jump the iron track of his own principles to\r\nsmuggle into matter a 'potency and promise' of all 'life.' Huxley\r\ncannot play fast and loose with human volition, nor juggle the\r\ntrustiness of memory into a state of consciousness, to save his\r\nsystem; nor may Haeckel lead us at his own sweet creative will through\r\nfourteen stages of vertebrate and eight of invertebrate life up to\r\nthe great imaginary 'monera,' the father and mother of us all. It will\r\nbe time to believe a million things in a lump when one of them is\r\nfully proved in detail. We have no disposition, even with so eminent\r\nan authority as St. George Mivart, to denominate Natural Selection 'a\r\npuerile hypothesis.' We will promise to pay our respects to our 'early\r\nprogenitor' of 'arboreal habits' and 'ears pointed and capable of\r\nmovement,' when he is honestly identified by his ear-marks, and even\r\nto worship the original fire-mist when that is properly shown to be\r\nour only Creator, Preserver, and Bountiful Benefactor.\r\n\r\n\"Meantime, as a late king of Naples was said to have erected the\r\nnegation of God into a system of government, not a few eager\r\ninvestigators seem to have assumed it as a basis of science. And so we\r\nreach out by worship 'mostly of the silent sort' toward the unknown\r\nand unknowable, the 'reservoir of organic force, the single source of\r\npower,' ourselves 'conscious automatons' in whom 'mind is the product\r\nof the brain,' thought, emotion, and will are but 'the expression of\r\nmolecular changes,' to whom all speculations in divinity are a\r\n'disregard of the proper economy of time,' and to whom, also, as one\r\nof them has declared, 'earth is Paradise,' and all beyond is blank.\r\nBut it was Mephistopheles who said,--\r\n\r\n    \"'The little god of this world sticks to the same old way,\r\n    And is as whimsical as on creation's day;\r\n    Life somewhat better might content him,\r\n    But for the gleam of heavenly light which thou hast lent him.\r\n    He calls it Reason--thence his power's increased\r\n    To be far beastlier than any beast.\r\n    Saving thy gracious presence, he to me\r\n    A long-legged grasshopper seems to be,\r\n    That springing flies and flying springs,\r\n    And in the grass the same old ditty sings.\r\n    Would he still lay among the grass he grows in.'\r\n\r\n\"But even the man of theories might grant that the scheme of one\r\ngreat, governing, guiding, loving, and holy God is a theory that works\r\nwonders in practice for those that heartily receive it, and is a\r\nconception of magnificence beside which even a Nebular Hypothesis with\r\nall its grandeur grows small. And the man of facts may as well\r\nrecognize what Napoleon saw on St. Helena,--the one grand fact of the\r\nliving power of Jesus Christ in history, and to-day; a force that is\r\nmightier than all other forces; a force that all other forces have in\r\nvain endeavored to destroy, or counteract, or arrest; a force that has\r\npushed its way against wit and learning and wealth and power, and the\r\nstake and the rack and the sword and the cannon, till it has shaped\r\nthe master forces of the world, inspired its art, formed its social\r\nlife, subsidized, its great powers, and wields to-day the heavy\r\nbattalions; a force that this hour beats in millions of hearts, all\r\nover this globe, with a living warmth beside which the love of science\r\nand art is cold and clammy. Surely it would be not much to ask for the\r\ndocility to recognize such patent facts as these. And I must believe\r\nthat any mind is fundamentally unhinged that despises the profoundest\r\nconvictions of the noblest hearts, or speaks lightly of the mighty\r\ninfluence that has moulded human events and has upheaved the world. It\r\nhas, in its arrogance, cut adrift and swung off from the two grand\r\nfoci of all truth, the human and the divine.\r\n\r\n\"Of the several qualities,--the wakefulness, precision, fullness,\r\nequipoise, and docility--that form, in other words, the motion, edge,\r\nweight, balance, and direction of the forged and tempered\r\nintellect,--I might give many instances. Such men as Thomas Arnold and\r\nMr. Gladstone instantly rise to the thoughts,--the one by his\r\ntruth-seeking and truth-finding spirit moulding a generation of\r\nEnglish scholars, the other carrying by the sheer force of his\r\nclear-cut intellect and magnanimous soul the sympathies of a great\r\nnation and the admiration of Christendom. But let me rather single out\r\none name from the land of specialties and limitations,--Barthold\r\nGeorge Niebuhr, the statesman and historian. Not perfect, indeed, but\r\nadmirable. See him begin in his early youth by saying,--'I do not ask\r\nmyself whether I can do a thing; I command myself to do it.' Read the\r\nsingular sketch of his intellectual gymnastics at twenty-one, spurring\r\nhimself to 'inward deep voluntary thought,' 'guarding against society\r\nand dissipation,' devoting an hour each day to clearing up his\r\nthoughts on given subjects, and two hours to the round of physical\r\nsciences; exacting of himself 'an extensive knowledge of the facts'\r\nof science and history; holding himself alike accountable for minute\r\n'description,' 'accurate definitions,' 'general laws,' 'deep\r\nreflection,' and 'distinct consciousness of the rules of my moral\r\nbeing,' together with what he calls the holy resolve--'more and more\r\nto purify my soul, so that it may be ready at all times to return to\r\nthe eternal source.' How intensely he toiled to counteract a certain\r\nconscious German one-sidedness of mind, visiting England to study all\r\nthe varied phenomena of its robust life, and yet writing home from\r\nLondon, at twenty-two,--'I positively shrink from associating with the\r\nyoung men on account of their unbounded dissoluteness.' His memory,\r\nnot inferior to that of Macaulay or Scaliger, he made strictly the\r\nservant of his thinking. Amid all the speculative tendencies of\r\nGermany, he became a man of facts and affairs. Overflowing with\r\ndetails, he probed the facts of history to the quick, and felt for its\r\nheart. Fertile in theory, he preserved the truth of science so pure as\r\n'in the sight of God,' not 'to write the very smallest thing as\r\ncertain, of which he was not fully convinced,' nor to overstrain the\r\nweight of a conjecture, nor even to cite as his own the _verified_\r\nquotation he had gained from another. Practicing on his own maxim to\r\n'open the heart to sincere veneration for all excellence' in human act\r\nand thought, not even his profound admiration for the surpassing\r\ngenius of Goethe could draw him into sympathy with the heartlessness\r\nand colossal egoism of his later career. In the midst of public honors\r\nhe valued more than all his delightful home and literary life, and his\r\nmotto was _Tecum habita_. Surrounded by Pyrrhonism, and bent by the\r\nnature of his studies toward skeptical habits, how grandly he\r\nrecovered himself in his maturity, and said,--'I do not know what to\r\ndo with a metaphysical God, and I will have none but the God of the\r\nBible, who is heart to heart with us.' 'My son shall believe in the\r\nletter of the Old and New Testaments, and I shall nurture in him from\r\nhis infancy a firm faith in all that I have lost or feel uncertain\r\nabout.' And his last written utterance, signed 'Your Old Niebuhr,'\r\ncontains a lament that 'depth, sincerity, originality, heart and\r\naffection are disappearing,' and that 'shallowness and arrogance are\r\nbecoming universal.' After all allowances for whatever of defect, one\r\ncan well point to such a character as an illustrious example of true\r\nand manly culture.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I say that such a culture as I have endeavored to sketch, it\r\nis, and will be, the aim of Dartmouth College to stimulate? I cannot,\r\nat the close of this discourse, compare in detail its methods with the\r\nend in view, and show their fitness. The original and central college\r\nis surrounded by its several departments, partly or wholly\r\nprofessional, each having its own specialty and excellence. The\r\ncentral college seeks to give that rounded education commonly called\r\nLiberal, and to give it in its very best estate. It will aim to\r\nengraft on the stock that is approved by the collective wisdom of the\r\npast, all such scions of modern origin as mark a real progress. By\r\nvariety of themes and methods it would stimulate the mental activity,\r\nand by the breadth of its range it would encourage fullness of\r\nmaterial, both physical and metaphysical, scientific and historic. It\r\ninitiates into the chief languages of Europe. By the close, protracted\r\nconcentration of the mathematics, by the intuitions, careful\r\ndistinctions, and fundamental investigations of intellectual and\r\nethical science, and by the broad principles of political economy,\r\nconstitutional and international law, as well as by a round of\r\noriginal discussions on themes of varied character, it aims to induce\r\nprecision and mastery. And all along this line runs and mingles\r\nharmoniously and felicitously that great branch of study for which,\r\nthough often severely assailed because unwisely defended or\r\ninadequately pursued, the revised and deliberate judgment of the\r\nablest and wisest men can find no fair substitute,--the study of the\r\nclassic tongues. Grant that it may be, and often is, mechanically or\r\npedantically pursued. Yet, when rightly prosecuted, its benefits are\r\nwide, deep, and continuous, more than can be easily set forth--and\r\nthey range through the whole scale, rising with the gradual expansion\r\nof the mind. It comprises subtle distinctions, close analysis, broad\r\ngeneralization, and that balancing of evidence which is the basis of\r\nall moral reasoning; it tracks the countless shadings of human\r\nthought, and their incarnation in the growths of speech, and seizes,\r\nin Comparative Philology, the universal affinities of the race: it\r\npasses in incessant review the stores of the mother tongue; it\r\nfurnishes the constant clew to the meaning of the vernacular, a basis\r\nfor the easy study of modern European languages, and a key to the\r\nterminology of science and art; it familiarizes intimately with many\r\nof the most remarkable monuments of genius and culture; and it imbues\r\nwith the history, life, and thought which have prompted, shaped, and\r\npermeated all that is notable in the intellectual achievements of two\r\nthousand years, and binds together the whole republic of letters. To\r\nsuch a study as this we must do honor. We endeavor to add so much of\r\nthe esthetic and ethical element throughout as shall give grace and\r\nworth. And we crown the whole with some teaching concerning the track\r\nof that amazing power that has overmastered all other powers, and\r\nstamped its impress on all modern history. The college was given to\r\nChrist in its infancy, and the message that comes down through a\r\ncentury to our ears, sounds not so much like the voice of a president\r\nas of an high-priest and prophet--the 'burden of Eleazar:' 'It is my\r\npurpose, by the grace of God, to leave nothing undone within my power\r\nwhich is suitable to be done, that this school of the prophets may be,\r\nand long continue to be, a pure fountain. And I do, with my whole\r\nheart, will this my purpose to my successors in the presidency of the\r\nseminary, to the latest posterity; and it is my last will, never to be\r\nrevoked, and to God I commit it, and my only hope and confidence for\r\nthe execution of it is in Him alone who has already done great things\r\nfor it, and does still own it as his cause.' God has never yet revoked\r\nthe 'last will' of Wheelock. The college is as confessedly a Christian\r\ncollege as in the days of her origin; and in the impending conflict\r\nshe sails up between the batteries of the enemy with her flag nailed\r\nto the mast and her captain lashed to the rigging.\r\n\r\n\"The college stands to-day in its ideal and the intention of its\r\nmanagers, representative of the best possible training for a noble\r\nmanhood. And I may venture to say, here and now, that if there be\r\nanything known to be yet lacking to the full attainment of that\r\nconception, if anything needs to be added to make this, in the fullest\r\nsense, the peer of the best college in the land, it will be the\r\nendeavor of the Trustees and the Faculty to add that thing.\r\n\r\n\"Dartmouth College is fortunate in many particulars. Fortunate in its\r\nsituation, so picturesque and so quiet, fitted for faithful study, and\r\nfull of healthful influences, physical and moral; fortunate in being\r\nthe one ancient and honored as well as honoring college of this\r\ncommonwealth; fortunate in enjoying the full sympathy of the people\r\naround and the entire confidence of the Christian community of the\r\nland; fortunate in the great class of young men who seek her\r\ninstruction, with their mature characters, simple habits, manly aims,\r\nand resolute purposes; fortunate in a laborious Faculty, whose\r\nwell-earned fame from time to time brings honorable and urgent calls\r\nto carry their light to other and wealthier seats of learning;\r\nfortunate in her magnificent roll of alumni, unsurpassed in its\r\naverage of good manhood and excellent work, and bright with names of\r\ntranscendent lustre. The genius of the place bespeaks our reverence\r\nand awe. For to the mind's eye this sequestered spot is peopled to\r\noverflowing with youthful forms that went forth to all the lands of\r\nthe earth to do valiantly in the battle of life. Across this quiet\r\ngreen there comes moving again invisibly a majestic procession of the\r\nfaithful and the strong, laden with labors and with honors. In these\r\nseats there can almost be seen to sit once more a hoary and venerable\r\narray of the great and good whose names are recorded on earth and\r\nwhose home is in heaven. And over us there seems to hover to-day a\r\ngreat cloud of witnesses--spirits of the just made perfect. It is good\r\nto be here. I only pray that the new arm may not prove too weak to\r\nbear the banner in this great procession of the ages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nPROF. JOHN SMITH.--PROF. SYLVANUS RIPLEY.--PROF. BEZALEEL WOODWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving completed our survey of the work of the successive presidents,\r\nthe deceased professors now claim our attention.\r\n\r\nThe following sketch of the life and labors of Prof. John Smith, is,\r\nin substance, from \"Sprague's Annals of the American Pulpit.\"\r\n\r\n\"John Smith, son of Joseph and Elisabeth (Palmer) Smith, was born at\r\nNewbury, (Byfield parish,) Mass., December 21, 1752. His mother was a\r\ndescendant of the Sawyer family, which came from England to this\r\ncountry in 1643, and settled in Rowley, where she was born. The son\r\nwas fitted for college at Dummer Academy, under the instruction of the\r\nwell known 'Master Moody.' He early discovered an uncommon taste for\r\nthe study of the languages, insomuch that his instructor predicted,\r\nwhile he was yet in his preparatory coarse, that he would attain to\r\neminence in that department.\r\n\r\n\"He entered the Junior class in Dartmouth College, in 1771, at the\r\ntime of the first Commencement in that institution. He went to Hanover\r\nin company with his preceptor and Governor Wentworth, and so new and\r\nunsettled was a portion of the country through which they passed, that\r\nthey were obliged to encamp one night in the woods. Their arrival at\r\nHanover excited great interest, and was celebrated by the roasting of\r\nan ox whole, at the Governor's expense, on a small cleared spot, near\r\nwhere the college now stands.\r\n\r\n\"He was admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1773; and\r\nimmediately after, was appointed preceptor of Moor's school at\r\nHanover. This appointment he accepted; and, while discharging his duty\r\nas a teacher, was also engaged in the study of Theology under the\r\ndirection of President Wheelock. In 1774 he was appointed tutor in\r\nthe college, and continued in the office until 1778. About this time\r\nhe received an invitation to settle in the ministry in West Hartford\r\nConn., and, in the course of the same year, was elected professor of\r\nLanguages in the college where he had been educated. His strong\r\npredilection for classical studies led him to accept the latter\r\nappointment; and until 1787 he joined to the duties of a professor\r\nthose of a tutor, receiving for all his services one hundred pounds,\r\nlawful money, annually. His professorship he retained till the close\r\nof his life. He was college librarian for thirty years,--from 1779 to\r\n1809. For two years he delivered lectures on Systematic Theology, in\r\ncollege, in connection with the public prayers on Saturday evening. He\r\nwas a Trustee of the college from 1788 to the time of his death. He\r\nalso officiated for many years as stated preacher in the village of\r\nHanover. In 1803, the degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred upon\r\nhim by Brown University.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Smith's abundant and unceasing labors as a professor, a minister,\r\nand an author, proved too much for his constitution, and are supposed\r\nto have hastened him out of life. He died in the exercise of a most\r\nserene and humble faith, on the 30th of April, 1809, in the\r\nfifty-seventh year of his age. His funeral sermon was preached by the\r\nRev. Dr. Burroughs of Hanover.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Smith was enthusiastically devoted to the study of languages\r\nthrough life. He prepared a Hebrew Grammar in his Junior year in\r\ncollege, which is dated May 14, 1772; and a revised preparation is\r\ndated February 11, 1774. About this time he also prepared a Chaldee\r\nGrammar. The original manuscript of these grammars, as also the\r\ngreater part of his lectures on Theology, is deposited in the Library\r\nof the Northern Academy of Arts and Sciences at Dartmouth College. As\r\nearly as 1779, he prepared a Latin Grammar, which was first published\r\nin 1802, and has gone through three editions. In 1803 he published a\r\nHebrew Grammar; in 1804, an edition of \"Cicero de Oratore,\" with\r\nnotes, and a brief memoir of Cicero, in English; and in 1809, a Greek\r\nGrammar, which was issued about the time of his decease. He published\r\nalso a Sermon at the dedication of the meeting house at Hanover, 1796,\r\nand a Sermon at the ordination of T. Eastman, 1801.\r\n\r\n\"Prof. Roswell Shurtleff, D.D., says of him: 'Dr. Smith was rather\r\nabove the middling stature, straight, and well proportioned. His head\r\nwas well formed, though blanched and bald somewhat in advance of his\r\nyears. His face, too, as to its lineaments, was very regular and\r\ncomely. His eyes were of a light-blue color, and tolerably clear.\r\n\r\n\"'As a linguist, he was minutely accurate, and faithful to his pupils,\r\nalthough I used to doubt whether he was familiar with the classic\r\nwriters much beyond the field of his daily instructions. But in his\r\nday, philology, like many other sciences, was comparatively in its\r\ncradle, especially in this country. His reputation in his profession\r\ndepended chiefly on the recitations; and there he was perfect to a\r\nproverb. The student never thought of appealing from his decision.\r\n\r\n\"'In his disposition he was very kind and obliging, and remarkably\r\ntender of the feelings of his pupils--a civility which was always duly\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n\"'In religious sentiment, he was unexceptionably orthodox, though\r\nfearful of Hopkinsianism, which made some noise in the country at that\r\nperiod. His voice was full and clear, and his articulation very\r\ndistinct. His sermons were written out with great accuracy, but were\r\nperhaps deficient in pungency of application. On the whole, he could\r\nhardly be considered a popular preacher.\r\n\r\n\"'Professor Smith was a man of uncommon industry. This must be\r\napparent from what he accomplished. Besides his two recitations daily,\r\nhe supplied the college and village with preaching for about twenty\r\nyears, and exchanged pulpits but very seldom; and, in the mean time,\r\nwas almost constantly engaged in some literary enterprise. I well\r\nremember a conversation with the late President Brown, then a tutor in\r\ncollege, soon after the professor died,--in which we agreed in the\r\nopinion, that we had known no man of the same natural endowments, who\r\nhad been more useful, or who had occupied his talent to better\r\nadvantage.'\"\r\n\r\nWe give the substance of some leading points of a notice of Professor\r\nSmith, in the \"Memoirs of Wheelock.\"\r\n\r\n\"In 1809 the college experienced an immense loss, in the death of Dr.\r\nSmith. He had devoted his life chiefly to the study of languages. No\r\nother professor in any college of the continent, had so long sustained\r\nthe office of instructor; none had been more happy, useful, or\r\ndiligent. Though indefatigable in his studies, he was always social\r\nand pleasant with his friends, entirely free from that reserve and\r\nmelancholy, not infrequent with men of letters. At an early age he\r\nobtained the honors of this seminary, and even while a young man was\r\nappointed professor of the Oriental Languages. These were the smallest\r\nmoiety of his merit and his fame. Without that intuitive genius, which\r\ncatches the relation of things at a glance, by diligence, by laborious\r\nstudy, by invincible perseverance, which set all difficulties at\r\ndefiance, he rose in his professorship with unrivaled lustre. He, like\r\na marble pillar, supported this seminary of learning. This fact is\r\nworth a thousand volumes of speculation, to prove the happy and noble\r\nfruits of well-directed diligence in study. But the best portrait of\r\nDr. Smith is drawn by President Wheelock, in his eulogium on his\r\nfriend, from which we make the following extract.\r\n\r\n\"'Early in life, so soon as his mind was susceptible of rational\r\nimprovement, his father entered him at Dummer school, under the\r\ninstruction of Mr. Samuel Moody. It is unnecessary to take notice of\r\nthe development of his juvenile mind, his attention to literature, and\r\nespecially his delight in the study of the ancient, Oriental\r\nLanguages. That distinguished master contemplated the height, to which\r\nhe would rise in this department; and his remark on him, when leaving\r\nthe school to enter this institution, was equal to a volume of eulogy.\r\n\r\n\"'His mind was not wholly isolated in one particular branch.\r\nPhilosophy, geography, criticism, and other parts of philology, held\r\nrespectable rank in his acquirements; but these yielded to a\r\nprevailing bias: the investigations of language unceasingly continued\r\nhis favorite object. The knowledge of the Hebrew with his propensity\r\nled him to the study of Theology. He filled the office of tutor in the\r\ncollege, when an invitation was made to him from Connecticut to settle\r\nin the ministry.\r\n\r\n\"'At this period, in the year 1778, the way was open to a\r\nprofessorship in the learned languages. On him the public eye was\r\nfixed. He undertook the duties, and entered the career of more\r\nsplendid services in the republic of letters. His solicitude and\r\nlabors were devoted to the institution, during its infantile state\r\nembarrassed by the Revolutionary war. He alleviated the burdens of the\r\nreverend founder of this establishment; and administered comfort and\r\nsolace to him in his declining days.\r\n\r\n\"'From that period in 1779, Dr. Smith continued indefatigable in\r\nmental applications; faithful in the discharge of official duties; and\r\nactive for the interest of the society, through scenes of trouble and\r\nadversity. The board of Trustees elected him a member of their body.\r\nThe church at the college, founded by my predecessor, intrusted with\r\nhim, as pastor, their spiritual concerns, and were prospered under his\r\nprudent and pious care. God blessed his labors; a golden harvest\r\nreminds us of the last. To the force of his various exertions, under\r\nDivine Providence, justice demands that we ascribe much in the rise\r\nand splendor of this establishment.\r\n\r\n\"'While surveying the circle of knowledge, and justly estimating the\r\nrelative importance of its different branches, still his eye was more\r\nfixed on classical science; and his attachment seemed to concentrate\r\nthe force of genius in developing the nature of language, and the\r\nprinciples of the learned tongues, on which the modern so much depend\r\nfor their perfection. The Latin, the Greek, and the Hebrew, were\r\nalmost as familiar to him as his native language. He clearly\r\ncomprehended the Samaritan and Chaldaic; and far extended his\r\nresearches in the Arabic.\r\n\r\n\"'The eminent attainments of Dr. Smith in the knowledge of the\r\nlanguages are attested by multitudes, scattered in the civilized\r\nworld, who enjoyed his instruction. They will be attested, in future\r\ntimes, by his Latin Grammar, published about seven years ago; and by\r\nhis Hebrew Grammar, which has since appeared. In each of these works,\r\nin a masterly manner, he treats of every matter proper for the student\r\nto know. Each subject is displayed, in a new method, with perspicuity,\r\nconciseness, simplicity, and classic taste. His Greek Grammar, we may\r\nsuppose, will exhibit the same traits, when it shall meet the public\r\neye. This last labor he had finished, and committed to the printer a\r\nfew months before his decease.[39]\r\n\r\n      [39] It was afterward published and much approved.\r\n\r\n\"'If we turn to take a moral view of this distinguished votary of\r\nscience, new motives will increase our esteem. What shall I say of the\r\npurity of his manners, his integrity and amiable virtues? These are\r\ntoo strongly impressed on the minds of all, who knew him, to need\r\ndescription. He was possessed of great modesty, and a degree of\r\nreserve, appearing at times to indicate diffidence, in the view of\r\nthose less acquainted. But this, itself, was an effusion of his\r\ngoodness, which led to yielding accomodation in matters of minor\r\nconcern: yet, however, when the interest of virtue, or society,\r\nrequired him to act, he formed his own opinion, and proceeded with\r\nunshaken firmness. Those intimately acquainted with him can bear\r\nwitness; and it is confirmed by invariable traits in his principles\r\nand practice, during life.\r\n\r\n\"'The virtues of Dr. Smith were not compressed within the circle of\r\nhuman relations, which vanish with time. Contemplating the first\r\ncause, the connections and dependencies in the moral state, his mind\r\nwas filled with a sense of interminable duties. He was a disciple of\r\nJesus. The former president admired and loved him, and taught him\r\nTheology. An amiable spirit actuated his whole life, and added\r\npeculiar splendor to the closing scene.\r\n\r\n\"'His intense pursuit of science affected his constitution, and\r\nproduced debility, which, more than two years before, began to be\r\nobserved by his friends. It gradually increased, but not greatly to\r\ninterrupt his applications till six weeks before his death. While I\r\nrevive the affliction at his departure, its accompanying circumstances\r\nwill assuage our sorrow. The thoughts of his resignation to Divine\r\nProvidence, through all the stages of a disease, that rapidly preyed\r\nupon his vitals, his composure, serenity, and Christian confidence,\r\nremain for the consolation of his friends, and instruction of all.\r\n\r\n\"'The fame of Dr. Smith does not arise from wealth, nor descent from\r\ntitled ancestors. It has no borrowed lustre. He was indebted wholly to\r\nhis genius, his labors, and his virtues. His monument will exist in\r\nthe hearts of his acquaintance; and in the future respect of those,\r\nwho shall derive advantage from his exertions.\r\n\r\n\"'In the immense loss, which his dear family sustain, they have saved\r\na precious legacy; his example, and lessons of social and religious\r\nduties. The church, with mournful regret, will retain the tenderest\r\naffection for their venerable pastor. What shall I say of this seat of\r\nscience, now covered with cypress? Those who have trod its hallowed\r\nwalks, will never forget his instructions, nor the benevolent\r\neffusions of his heart. Where, in the ranges of cultivated society, is\r\none to be found, qualified with those rare endowments, which can\r\nsupply the chasm made by his death?'\"\r\n\r\nWe insert in its appropriate place the contract made with Professor\r\nSmith by President Wheelock.[40]\r\n\r\n      [40] See Appendix.\r\n\r\nHis first wife was Mary, daughter of Rev. Ebenezer Cleaveland, of\r\nGloucester, Mass., his second wife was Susan, daughter of David Mason,\r\nof Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProf. Sylvanus Ripley, who filled the chair of Divinity from 1782 to\r\n1787, was the son of Jonathan Ripley, and was born at Halifax, Mass.,\r\nSeptember 29, 1749.\r\n\r\nIn introducing him to the favorable notice of Mr. Wheelock, previous\r\nto the commencement of his religious life, Rev. William Patten says:\r\n\"Gracious exercises alone excepted, I know not a more promising young\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\nSome extracts from President Wheelock's \"Narratives,\" relating to\r\nProf. Ripley's missionary labors, are worthy of attention.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sylvanus Ripley, who finished his course of collegiate studies\r\nhere last fall, very cheerfully complied with the openings of\r\nProvidence, to undertake a mission to the tribes in Canada, and\r\naccordingly prepared for that purpose, and set out with Lieut. Thomas\r\nTaylor, whom he had made choice of for his companion in that tour, as\r\nhe had been long a captive with the French and Indians in those parts,\r\nand was well acquainted with the customs of both, and with their\r\ncountry, and could serve him as an interpreter. He sat out July 17,\r\nwell recommended to the Lieut.-governor and Commander-in-chief, and\r\nothers of that province, by his Excellency Governor Wentworth, and\r\nothers. The special design of his journey was to see what door, or\r\ndoors, was, or might be opened for him, or others, to go as\r\nmissionaries among them, to open a way for intercourse between them\r\nand this school, and obtain a number of suitable youth, if it may be,\r\nto receive an education here; in the choice of which, he will have\r\nspecial respect to the children, whose parents were in former wars\r\ncaptivated by the Indians, and were naturalized, and married among\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"September 26, 1772. A delay of sending the foregoing narrative to the\r\npress, gives an opportunity to oblige my friends with a short account\r\nof the success of Mr. Ripley's mission to Canada.\r\n\r\n\"He returned on the 21st instant, with his companion and interpreter,\r\nLieut. Taylor, and brought with them ten youths, eight belonging to\r\nthe tribe at Caughnawaga, near Montreal, and two of the tribe at\r\nLorette, near Quebec. Soon after his arrival at the former of these\r\nplaces, he made known to them the errand on which he was sent, and\r\ndisclosed the proposal of sending a number of their children to this\r\nschool for an education; and left it to their consideration, till he\r\nshould go and wait upon the Commander-in-chief of that province at\r\nQuebec. And after he had passed through the small-pox, which he took\r\nby inoculation, as it was judged unsafe for him to travel that country\r\nwithout it, he went to Quebec. But his Honor the Governor, as well as\r\nother English gentlemen, were apprehensive that the Indians were so\r\nbigoted to the Romish religion, that there was no hope of success, and\r\nadvised him not to go on that errand to Lorette: he accordingly\r\nreturned without visiting them as he proposed.\r\n\r\n\"But on his coming to Caughnawaga he found there two likely young men\r\nof the tribe at Loretto, who set out with a design to go to Sir\r\nWilliam Johnson, with a single view to find a school in which they\r\nmight get useful knowledge. They had heard nothing of Mr. Ripley, nor\r\nof any such design as he was upon in their favor, till they came to\r\nCaughnawaga, which is 180 miles on their way to Sir William's, and on\r\nhearing of the proposal Mr. Ripley had made, they waited five weeks at\r\nthat place for his return, and on his coming complied with his offer\r\nof taking them into this school with cheerfulness. The same day a\r\ncouncil of the chiefs of that tribe was called to consider of the\r\nproposal of sending their children to this school, which Mr. Ripley\r\nhad left to their consideration, in which they were to a man agreed in\r\nthe affirmative, and acknowledged with gratitude the benevolence and\r\nkindness of the offer. They continued united and firm to the last in\r\nthat determination against the most warm and zealous remonstrances of\r\ntheir priest, both in public and private; in consequence of which\r\ndetermination, nine of their boys were made ready to accompany Mr.\r\nRipley hither; three of which were children or descendants from\r\ncaptives, who had been captivated when they were young, and lived with\r\nthem till they were naturalized and married among them.\"\r\n\r\nA later \"Narrative\" says:\r\n\r\n\"The beginning of May [1773], the Rev. Mr. Ripley and Mr. Dean sat out\r\non a mission to visit the Indians at Penobscott, and on the Bay of\r\nFundy, as they should find encouragement, agreeable to representations\r\nheretofore made of a door open for service among them.\"\r\n\r\nThey had a good measure of success, in some respects, in this mission.\r\n\r\nThe following tribute to Professor Ripley is from the \"Memoirs of\r\nWheelock.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the winter of 1786-7, the college experienced the loss of an\r\neminent instructor, the Rev. Sylvanus Ripley. He was suddenly called\r\nfrom his labors, in the vigor of life and the midst of extensive\r\nusefulness.\r\n\r\n\"After taking his degree in 1771, in the first class which received\r\nthe honors of the college, he continued with Mr. Wheelock as a tutor\r\nin the college. In 1775, he was appointed master of Moor's Charity\r\nSchool, and in 1779, upon the decease of Dr. Wheelock, he succeeded\r\nhim in the pastoral care of the church in the college, and soon after\r\nwas elected professor of Divinity. Professor Ripley was a learned man,\r\nan orthodox divine, an evangelical and popular preacher. His eloquence\r\nhad nothing artificial or studied. His sermons were seldom written;\r\nhis manner was pleasing and winning, his words flowed as promptly and\r\nreadily in the pulpit as in the social circle.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Ripley died at Hanover, February 5, 1787, of injuries\r\nreceived in a fall from his carriage, while returning from a religious\r\nservice in a distant part of the town.\r\n\r\nHis wife was Abigail, daughter of Pres. Eleazar Wheelock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBezaleel Woodward, the first professor of mathematics in the college,\r\nwas the son of Israel and Mary (Sims) Woodward, and a descendant of\r\nHenry Woodward of Dorchester, Mass., 1638, and Northampton, Mass.,\r\n1639, where he was one of the \"seven pillars\" of the church formed\r\nthere in 1661. He was born at Lebanon, Conn., July 16, 1745, and\r\ngraduated at Yale College in 1764.\r\n\r\nIn 1767, Mr. Wheelock refers to him as an associate teacher, and \"a\r\ndear youth, willing to do anything in his power\" to aid him. The\r\nschool is said to have been put on a college basis, in the matter of\r\nstudy, in 1768, with Mr. Woodward as tutor.\r\n\r\nThe following letter addressed to President Wheelock illustrates the\r\nversatile nature of his talents:\r\n\r\n\"Lebanon Sep^r 6^th 1770.\r\n\r\n\"Rev^d & hon^d Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Bingham arrived home well last week, and proposes to set out with two\r\nteams about the 18^th Ins^t. We have all of us been endeavouring to\r\nexpedite the removal ever since he came home--but I fear Madam will\r\nnot be able to set out so soon. She with Miss Nabby propose to ride in\r\nthe Post Chaise as soon as they can possibly be ready. Hutchinson is\r\nto drive it for them. The Scholars will likely the most of them foot\r\nit when Bingham goes. Abraham & Daniel seem to resent it that they in\r\nparticular should be sat to drive the Cows the Doctor mentioned in\r\nhis to me & the English Scholars be excused from it. I have not\r\nprocured Cows as yet--we have all been doing & shall do every thing in\r\nour power. Madam is so weak that a little croud overcomes her, that\r\nshe has her poor turns very often; tho' on the whole I hope she is on\r\nthe mending hand. I fear the fatigue of preparing & the journey will\r\nbe too much for her--be sure unless she takes both very leisurely--but\r\nGod is able to support her. By the tenor of the Doctor's Letters I\r\napprehend he has forgot my proposed Journey to the eastward, which I\r\nwould neglect, and with vigor pursue the grand object, the removal;\r\nfor I see need enough that every one who is able to do any thing\r\ntowards preparing should be doubly active now. I see eno' & more than\r\neno' that is important and necessary to be done, & I never had a\r\ngreater disposition to exert myself in getting things forward--but I\r\nhave had such a croud of affairs on my mind, & still have, & must have\r\nso long as I continue here, that my health is so much impaired, my\r\nconstitution become so brittle, & my nerves so weak, that I am\r\nrendered entirely unfit for application to any business at present; &\r\ntherefore that I may be fit for some kind of business the ensuing\r\nwinter I am advised and think it highly expedient & neccessary that I\r\ntake my Journey soon (before I am rendered unable to do it)--and\r\nProvidence seems to point out my duty to set out to-morrow, tho' it is\r\nwith the greatest reluctance that I do it, on acco^t of the need of\r\nhelp here, but I am unfit to do anything to purpose if I stay. M^r\r\nMacCluer will do all in his power, tho' he is obliged (agreeable to\r\nthe Doctor's directions) to attend Co[=m]encement next week to collect\r\nSubscriptions--he'll do all he can before he goes, & after he\r\nreturns--what _is_ done _must_ be done in a hurry and confusion, &\r\nwhat _cannot_ be done _must remain undone_. We have been examining the\r\nScholars this week (& find they make a pretty good appearance) besides\r\nwhich we have done all we could that I might leave affairs in the best\r\nmanner. My present proposal is to go to Boston & settle\r\naffairs--thence to Salem & visit dear Doctor Whitaker--thence perhaps\r\nto Portsmouth--then either return & accompany Madam & Family to Cohos\r\n(which I think of doing if I can get back in season)--or go directly\r\nfrom Portsmouth to Cohos--in either case I hope to be with the Doctor\r\nwithin a month. I want much--I long to see you. I want to do more,\r\nmuch more than I am able, to assist in removing--but the wise Governor\r\nof the Universe seems to forbid my doing much. I desire to commit the\r\nconduct of affairs to him. I shall endeavour as far as I am able to\r\ncomply with all the D^r desires in his letters--shall carry the letter\r\nto M^r Whitefield to Boston myself. I shall write to M^r Keen a\r\ngeneral Sketch of affairs. I hope to be able when I see the D^r & the\r\nTrustees meet to be able to determine what to do the ensuing winter.\r\nThis Parish have M^r Potter to preach next Sabbath & expect M^r Austin\r\nafter that. M^r Austin is now asleep in your house. I expect M^r\r\nWheelock will be at home the last of next week or beginning of week\r\nafter. Mary & Cloe I expect will ride up in the Carts. Porter, Judson\r\n& Collins are to set out next Monday (at their desire) that they may\r\nassist in making preparation. School must (I think) unavoidably break\r\nup till they remove. Scholars have been much engaged in study\r\n(especially in the Art of Speaking) since the Doctor went away. If\r\nScholars are engaged Instructors must be so too--and if Instructors\r\nare diligent and faithful, Scholars will make improvement. We cannot\r\nlearn that the duty on tea is taken off; and I expect difficulty in\r\ndisposing of Bills; but shall do the best I can. I have tho'ts of\r\ncarrying a Set to Boston. Is it not best to desire Miss Zurviah\r\n[Sprague] not to engage herself in business 'till the Doctor's mind\r\ncan be known respecting her going to Cohos--I know not where one can\r\nbe had to supply her place (omnibus consideratio)--will the D^r write\r\nhis mind respecting it in his next? I have many things to say; but it\r\nis now between 1 & 2 o'Clock in y^e morning, and I find nature flags.\r\nI could get no other time to write. I have neither time nor strength\r\nto copy, therefore hope the D^r will excuse the scrawl from him who is\r\nwith much duty & esteem Rev^d & hon^d Sir,\r\n\r\n    \"Your obedient and humble Serv^t.\r\n    \"Beza Woodward.\r\n\r\n\"N.

His profound knowledge of the abstruse and\r\nuseful science of Mathematics, the facility of his instructions in\r\nnatural and experimental Philosophy and Ethics, his condescending and\r\namiable manners, will be long and gratefully remembered by those who\r\nhave received the benefit of his instructions.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Monthly Anthology and Massachusetts Magazine\" for September,\r\n1804, has the following notice of Professor Woodward:\r\n\r\n\"Died at Hanover, New Hampshire, August 25, Hon. Bezaleel Woodward,\r\nProfessor of Mathematics and Philosophy in Dartmouth College.\r\nProfessor Woodward was born at Lebanon, in the State of Connecticut.\r\nIn the twentieth year of his age he graduated at Yale College, 1764.\r\nAfter a few years successfully employed in the ministry, he was\r\nelected a tutor in this university. Here he soon displayed such\r\ntalents and improvements, such readiness of thought and ease of\r\ncommunication, that he was appointed to the office of professor in\r\nMathematics and Philosophy. The dignity with which he discharged the\r\nduties of his station is witnessed by all who have shared in his\r\ninstruction. In the civil department, and as a member of society, he\r\nwas no less eminent than as an instructor in college. We might also\r\nadd his usefulness in the church of Christ at this place, of which he\r\nwas long a worthy member, and high in the esteem and affections of his\r\nChristian brethren.\r\n\r\n\"His remains were interred on Tuesday, the 28th. The Rev. Doctor Smith\r\ndelivered upon the occasion a well-adapted discourse. The officers,\r\nTrustees, and members of the college joined as mourners with the\r\nafflicted family, and the solemnities were attended by a very numerous\r\ncollection of friends and acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\"The alumni of Dartmouth will join with its present officers and\r\nmembers in deploring the loss of a faithful and able instructor.\r\nThose who visited him in his late illness have had a specimen of\r\ndecaying greatness, alleviated by an approving conscience, and\r\nsustained by resignation and hope. The friends of science will lament\r\nthe departure of one of its enlightened patrons. Society sympathizes\r\nwith the bereaved family, retaining a lively sense of his public and\r\ndomestic virtues; and a numerous acquaintance will mingle their grief\r\nin bemoaning the loss of a sincere friend, a valuable citizen, and an\r\nexemplary Christian.\"\r\n\r\nThe records of the public life of Professor Woodward are thoroughly\r\ninterwoven with the history of northern New England. Few pioneers in\r\nthe valley of the upper Connecticut did more to promote the general\r\nwelfare of the community.\r\n\r\nHis wife was Mary, daughter of Pres. Eleazar Wheelock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nPROF. JOHN HUBBARD.--PROF. ROSWELL SHURTLEFF.\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. John Hubbard succeeded Professor Woodward. We quote from a\r\npublished eulogy by Rev. Elijah Parish, D.D., his college classmate.\r\n\r\n\"The Hon. John Hubbard, the son of John and Hannah (Johnson) Hubbard,\r\nlate Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in this\r\nuniversity, was born in Townsend, Mass., August 8, 1759. Dark and\r\ndismal was the dawn of that life, which has been so fair and luminous.\r\nFive months before his birth his father died, and this, in his last\r\nmoments, when his children stood weeping round his dying bed, he made\r\nuse of as an argument of consolation to them, entreating them not to\r\nweep, for God had taken care of him when a fatherless infant. During\r\nhis minority most of his time was employed in the labors of\r\nagriculture. At the age of twenty-one he commenced his studies, and\r\nthe next year became a member of this institution. In the second year\r\nof his residence at college, when many were awakened to a religious\r\nsense of divine things, our friend was one of the happy number. His\r\nsubsequent life and death have proved that his conversion was not\r\nimaginary. While this increases our loss, it is the best reason for\r\nconsolation.\r\n\r\n\"In his college life Mr. Hubbard was a youthful cedar of Lebanon. He\r\ngave visible tokens of his approaching eminence. So tenacious was his\r\nmemory, that his progress in the languages was remarkably rapid. While\r\nhe lived, the Greek and Roman writers were his amusement; and with a\r\ntaste refined, he was charmed with their classic beauties; his memory\r\nwas stored with numerous favorite passages.\r\n\r\n\"On leaving college, his love of study, his delight in religious\r\ninquiries, his devout regard for the best interests of man, led him to\r\nthe study of theology. Becoming a preacher of the gospel, his voice,\r\nnaturally small and feeble, was found to be ill adapted to such an\r\nemployment. After a fair experiment his good sense forbade him to\r\npersevere. The transition was easy to his 'delightful task to teach\r\nthe young idea how to shoot,' and form the minds of youth to science\r\nand virtue. Of the academy in New Ipswich he was elected preceptor.\r\nUnder his able instruction that seminary rose to distinction, and\r\nbecame a favorite of the public. Some who were his pupils are already\r\neminent in the walks of literature.\r\n\r\n\"After several years, quitting this situation, he was appointed Judge\r\nof Probate for the County of Cheshire. This office was peculiarly\r\nadapted to that gentle and tender philanthropy for which he was\r\nremarkable. It was luxury to him to comfort the widow and the\r\nfatherless. The blended resolution and exquisite sensibilities of his\r\nheart qualified him, in a singular manner, impartially to weigh the\r\nclaims of justice and compassion. But this situation was not congenial\r\nwith his love of study, and his delight in the instruction of youth,\r\nwhich was so pleasant, that he declared he would make it the business\r\nof his life. Accordingly he accepted the invitation of Deerfield\r\nAcademy, Massachusetts, where for several years he continued with\r\ngreat reputation. After the death of Professor Woodward, who had, from\r\nits origin, been an able instructor in this university, he was elected\r\nhis successor in the Professorship of Mathematics and Philosophy. So\r\nhigh was his reputation, that a successor of common attainments could\r\nnot have satisfied the raised expectations of the public. To supply\r\nthe place of such a man was the arduous task assigned to Mr. Hubbard.\r\nHis success equaled the fond hopes of his friends. Here you rejoiced\r\nin his light; here he spent his last and his best days; here he had\r\nfull scope for the various, the versatile powers of his vigorous mind.\r\nHis amiable virtues, his profound learning, you cheerfully\r\nacknowledged.\r\n\r\n\"He had a happy facility in illustrating the practical advantages of\r\nevery science. He not only explained its principles, but traced its\r\nrelation to other branches of knowledge. Not satisfied by merely\r\nascertaining facts, he explored the cause, the means, the ultimate\r\ndesign of their existence.\r\n\r\n\"Though he has been my intimate friend from cheerful youth, yet\r\nneither inspired by his genius, nor enriched with his attainments, it\r\nis not possible I should do justice to his merits. His person,\r\nmuscular and vigorous, indicated the energy of his mind. Every feature\r\nof his face expressed the mildness of his spirit; never did I witness\r\nin him the appearance of anger. Without that undescribable\r\nconfiguration which constitutes beauty, his countenance was pleasing\r\nand commanded respect. Without formality or art, his manners were\r\nrefined and delicate; his address was conciliatory and winning. By his\r\nsocial and compliant temper he was calculated for general society.\r\nThough instructed 'in the learning of Egypt,' and the civilized world,\r\nhe was too discreet and benevolent to humble others by his superior\r\nlustre. His light was mild and clear, like that of the setting sun. He\r\nhad no ambition to shine, or to court applause. More disposed to make\r\nothers pleased with themselves than to excite their admiration, it is\r\nnot strange that he was universally beloved. His heart was impressed\r\nwith an exquisite sense of moral obligations. In every passing event,\r\nin every work of nature, the formation of a lake, a river, a cataract,\r\na mountain, he saw God. When as a philosopher, surrounded with the\r\napparatus of science, extending his researches to the phenomena of the\r\nuniverse, amazed at the minuteness of some objects, astonished at the\r\nmagnitude and magnificence of others, his mind was transported; when\r\nhe explored the heavens, and saw worlds balancing worlds, and other\r\nsuns enlightening other systems, his senses were ravished with the\r\nwisdom, the power, the goodness of the Almighty Architect. On these\r\nsubjects he often declaimed, with the learning of an astronomer, the\r\nsimplicity of an apostle, the eloquence of a prophet. He illustrated\r\nthe moral and religious improvement of the sciences; the views of his\r\nstudents were enlarged; the sciences became brilliant stars to\r\nirradiate the hemisphere of Christianity. The perfect agreement\r\nbetween sound learning and true religion was a favorite theme of his\r\nheart. This remark is confirmed by his conversation, his letters, his\r\nlectures.\r\n\r\n\"In theology his researches were not those of a polemic divine, but of\r\na Christian, concerned for his own salvation and the salvation of\r\nothers.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Hubbard published several works, one of them being entitled\r\n\"Rudiments of Geography.\" He died at Hanover, August 14, 1810.\r\n\r\nHis wife was Rebecca, daughter of Dr. John Preston, of New Ipswich.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Roswell Shurtleff was elected the second professor of Divinity in\r\nthe college. We give some of the more important points in a published\r\n\"Discourse,\" by Professor Long:\r\n\r\n\"Roswell Shurtleff, the son of William and Hannah (Cady) Shurtleff,\r\nwas born at Ellington, then East Windsor, Ct., August 29, 1773. He was\r\nthe youngest of nine children, two of whom died before he was born.\r\nFrom his earliest years he was fond of reading, and at school he was\r\ncalled a good scholar. His religious training was carefully attended\r\nto, and to this, and the Christian example which accompanied it, he\r\nascribed his conversion, and the views he subsequently embraced of the\r\nChristian doctrines.\r\n\r\n\"When he was seven or eight years old he had many serious thoughts of\r\nGod and duty. The requirement that he should give up all for God, as\r\nhe understood it, filled him with gloom.\r\n\r\n\"During several of the subsequent years, the subject of religion dwelt\r\non his mind, and he was occasionally deeply impressed. One of the\r\ndifficult things was to comprehend the notion of faith. The promise\r\nwas: 'He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.' He believed,\r\nas he supposed, and he had been baptized, but he could not feel that\r\nhe was safe. Must he believe that he, personally, should be saved? But\r\nwhat if he mistook his own character, and believed what was false;\r\nwould his opinion of his safety _make_ him safe. He was ashamed to be\r\nknown as a religious inquirer, and, therefore, remained longer in\r\ndarkness. Finding that he had been observed by his father to have\r\nbecome a more diligent student of the Scriptures, he left the practice\r\nof reading them before the family. Sometimes, assuming a false\r\nappearance of indifference, he carried his difficulties to his mother,\r\nwho was able to furnish a satisfactory solution. She seems to have\r\nbeen a person of unusual intelligence as well as goodness. Her memory\r\nwas ever cherished by him with the most grateful affection, as it\r\nregarded his own spiritual progress. He believed that he suffered\r\nunspeakable loss from the concealment of his early feelings on the\r\nsubject of religion, and did not doubt that many failed of conversion\r\nfrom this foolish reserve. It was not till a number of years after\r\nthis that his religious life commenced.\r\n\r\n\"The only school which young Shurtleff had the opportunity of\r\nattending, before his eighteenth or nineteenth year, was the common\r\nschool of the district. He made good proficiency, but nothing worthy\r\nof note occurred in relation to his studies till he was about fifteen\r\nyears of age. He then began to think, as he says. Before that time, he\r\nhad repeated by rote whatever he had been taught. The first impulse to\r\nreflection was a new discovery. He had been taught from childhood that\r\naccent is a stress of voice laid on some syllable or letter of a word.\r\nBut this definition had not been illustrated by an example, and the\r\nclassification of words by their accent, in the spelling-book, he had\r\nnever understood. The definition had been to him an unmeaning\r\ncollection of words. He now discovered what it meant. This was in\r\nitself a trifling event, but it led to the further discovery that\r\nother things, which he had been accustomed, parrot-like, to repeat\r\n_memoriter_, had a meaning; that the meaning of things was that which\r\nthe student should be set to learn, and that his own education had, in\r\nthis view, been greatly neglected. He says that a new world seemed to\r\nbe opened to his view; that nothing now appeared so important as an\r\nopportunity to reflect on what he had learned, and that he was greatly\r\ndispleased with the instructors by whom he had been so badly cheated.\r\nHe resolved that, if ever he should be a teacher, he would propose it\r\nto himself, as his leading object, to make his pupils understand\r\nwhatever they should study. This resolution he afterward had the\r\nopportunity of carrying into effect in five or six winter schools; and\r\nhis attempt was attended with gratifying success.\r\n\r\n\"It was the opinion of Dr. Shurtleff, grounded on his own experience\r\nas learner and teacher, that too much importance is attached to the\r\nbooks used in schools; that the end to be reached is too generally\r\nregarded as the learning of the book rather than the mastery of the\r\nsubject, and that books are too often prepared mainly with a view to\r\nabridge the labor of the teacher. He believed that, while the pupil\r\nmight, through the text-book, possess himself of the knowledge of\r\nothers, he was in danger of acquiring little which could be called his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\"In consequence of using his eyes too soon, after his recovery from\r\nthe measles, when he was about seventeen years old, Shurtleff was\r\nalmost wholly cut off from the reading of books for two years, and he\r\nnever afterward perfectly recovered from the injury resulting from\r\nthis imprudence. He made some proficiency, however, by listening to\r\nthe reading of others. About two years after this affliction he\r\nentered the academy at Chesterfield, N. H., whither his father's\r\nfamily had removed a few years before. He attended first to English\r\nstudies. The weakness of his eyes continued, and he was considerably\r\nembarrassed for a time from the necessity of using the eyes of his\r\nfriends. At length he commenced the study of Latin, going through\r\nRoss' Grammar, the only one then in use, in just two weeks, and then\r\nbeginning to construe and parse in Corderius.\r\n\r\n\"He met, at the academy, one who had been his school-fellow and\r\nplaymate, and with whom he was intimately associated from that time\r\ntill the end of his college course,--the late Hon. Levi Jackson, who\r\ndied at Chesterfield in 1821. They got out their lessons together,\r\ntaking turns in looking out new words; and afterward, at college,\r\nwhere they were classmates and room-mates, continued the practice. Dr.\r\nShurtleff felt under great obligations to this friend and helper, and\r\nsaid that 'few friendships among men had been more ardent, confiding\r\nand permanent.'\r\n\r\n\"Shurtleff had supposed, at first, that the Greek language was beyond\r\nhis reach, on account of his infirmity of sight. But some improvement\r\nhaving taken place, he ventured to commence the study. He went through\r\nthe Westminster Greek Grammar, the book then in use, in one week, and\r\nbegan to read the Gospel of John. Having completed the New Testament,\r\nand read several books of Homer's Iliad, he was reputed in the school\r\nas tolerably versed in Greek. He and Jackson studied from the love of\r\nstudy, and did not think of college till a year before they applied\r\nfor admission, at Commencement, in 1797, and entered the Junior class\r\nin this institution.\r\n\r\n\"The round of college duties presents few marked events. Time has left\r\nno record of most of the occurrences which diversified and enlivened\r\nthe period from 1797 to 1799. How the two friends studied, and read,\r\nand discussed, and recreated together, has been lost, just as the\r\nfacts of our daily life will be lost sixty years hence. They made\r\nconstant and good progress. They were about equally good scholars,\r\nneither of them being a dead weight upon the other. Each was happy in\r\nthe other's proficiency. The amount of learning requisite for a degree\r\nwas less then than now. Sciences have been introduced into the course\r\nwhich were then in their infancy. But it may be doubted whether the\r\nstudents of our day have the advantage over those of an earlier\r\nperiod, in respect to thoroughness as well as extent of attainment.\r\nThey read fewer books, in the first years of the college, but they\r\nthought the more. They were as well disciplined and able, and as\r\ncompetent to handle a difficult subject, I imagine, as our students,\r\nif they were not as well informed. We know from the esteem in which\r\nShurtleff was held by the Trustees and Faculty, as it appeared not\r\nlong after his graduation, that he was one of the best scholars of his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"Peculiar interest attaches to the religious experience of Shurtleff\r\nduring his college course.\r\n\r\n\"He had performed some of the duties of a Christian before he supposed\r\nhimself to possess the Christian character. The first school he taught\r\nhe opened daily with prayer, persevering in the practice as a\r\nconscientious duty, in spite of many misgivings and much timidity. And\r\nthis he did in every school he afterward taught. He kept up the habit\r\nof secret prayer, at the same time, asking more earnestly than for\r\nanything else, that his weak eyes might be cured, and that he might\r\nhave the means of intellectual improvement.\r\n\r\n\"He seems to have supposed that during his senior winter vacation he\r\nbecame a true Christian.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after his return to college, he intimated a desire to a\r\nclassmate, who, as he supposed, was the only professor of religion in\r\nthe class, to join with others in a private meeting for religious\r\nconference and prayer. He had never attended, or even heard of such a\r\nmeeting. After a little delay he was surprised to learn from his\r\nfriend that such a meeting as he had proposed had been held for years,\r\nand that he was desired to attend. On the Saturday evening following,\r\nhe and five or six other persons assembled, and by the free\r\ninterchange of thought and feeling, and the apparently humble prayers\r\nthat were offered, he felt himself greatly refreshed and quickened. On\r\nleaving college he regretted the loss of nothing more than of these\r\nSaturday evening conference meetings.\r\n\r\n\"The time had now come for choosing a profession. His success in\r\nteaching led him to seek for a situation in an academy; but no opening\r\nof this kind presented itself, and he believed himself thus\r\nprovidentially called to preach the gospel. There were at the time no\r\ntheological seminaries; the students of the distinguished clergymen\r\nwho gave instruction in theology were supposed to represent the views\r\nof their teacher; and that he might not be thought to go forth as the\r\nadvocate of some exceptionable _ism_, Mr. Shurtleff chose to study\r\ntheology by himself. Having pursued this course one year, he was\r\nappointed a tutor in the college, and at the same time was licensed to\r\npreach. The pressure of a considerable debt hastened the period of\r\nobtaining license, but we may be certain, from the opportunities\r\nsubsequently enjoyed, and from the character of the man, that any\r\ndeficiency he may have felt at first, from hasty preparation, was\r\nabundantly supplied.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Shurtleff continued in the tutorship from 1800 to 1804, and was\r\nalso engaged, for the greater part of the time, in preaching in vacant\r\nparishes.\r\n\r\n\"After the close of the four years' tutorship, Mr. Shurtleff was\r\nappointed a professor of Divinity in the college. It was a part of his\r\nduty to preach to the students and the people of the village. The\r\nchurch was at that time Presbyterian. The predecessor of Professor\r\nShurtleff--Professor Sylvanus Ripley--had been the pastor of this\r\nchurch. Since his death, in 1787, Dr. John Smith, professor of\r\nLanguages, previously associate pastor with Professor Ripley, had been\r\nthe sole pastor of the church. Dr. Backus, of Conn., Dr. Worcester, of\r\nSalem, and Dr. Alexander, of Princeton, had been appointed at\r\ndifferent times to the vacant professorship, but all had declined, in\r\nconsequence, as it was supposed, of the influence of Dr. John\r\nWheelock, the second president of the college. Professor Shurtleff\r\naccepted the office, expecting that the same causes which had kept it\r\nso long vacant would render it an uncomfortable post. The difficulties\r\nwhich he feared, he was called to encounter. The president wished him\r\nto become the colleague of Professor Smith in the pastoral office, but\r\nhe refused,--agreeing in his decision with the views of the largest\r\npart of the church and of the village. In consequence of this\r\ndisagreement, a controversy ensued which lasted several years, and\r\nended in the law-suit between the college and the State, in 1816-17.\r\nIn July, 1805, twenty-two persons, professors of religion, were\r\nconstituted 'The Congregational Church at Dartmouth College.' To this\r\nchurch, and the religious society of which it was a part, Professor\r\nShurtleff was invited to preach, performing pastoral labors so far as\r\nhis other duties would permit. Professor Smith was, meanwhile, the\r\npastor of the Presbyterian church till the time of his death, in\r\nApril, 1809. Professor Shurtleff was ordained as an evangelist, at\r\nLyme, N. H., in 1810. He continued in this relation until the year\r\n1827.\r\n\r\n\"The literary labors of his office would have been quite sufficient to\r\noccupy all his time. In addition to these, an amount of work nearly\r\nequal to that of any pastor of a church was imposed on him--fully\r\nequal, perhaps, we shall say, if we consider the character of the\r\ncongregation to whom he ministered. He was faithful and assiduous,\r\nboth as a preacher and a pastor. But he performed the many duties of\r\nhis station with acceptance and success. And he had the satisfaction\r\nof seeing that his efforts were crowned with the special blessing of\r\nGod. In 1805 God displayed his saving power among the students and\r\npeople of the village. As many as forty persons became Christians\r\nduring the revival. But the most extensive and powerful work of grace,\r\nprobably, which the church ever enjoyed was that of 1815. The revival\r\nbegan in the hearts of God's people. Some of the pious students\r\nresolved that they would every day talk with some unconverted person\r\nrespecting the interests of his soul. The effect of this soon appeared\r\nin a general religious awakening. In one week forty persons expressed\r\nhope in Christ, and in four weeks as many as one hundred and twenty\r\npersons were supposed to be converted. There were also revivals in\r\n1819, 1821, and 1826,--that of 1821 being the most extensive, and\r\nembracing among the converts a greater number of citizens than of\r\nstudents. Public religious meetings were less numerous during the\r\nrevivals than in most of those of a later period. It was before the\r\nday of protracted meetings. Perhaps there was less reliance then on\r\nmeans, and more on the Spirit of God. It was not thought necessary\r\nthat business should be suspended, and every day converted into a\r\nSabbath. But such means as the state of feeling seemed to require were\r\nfaithfully used. Professor Shurtleff was never happier than when\r\nengaged in conversation with inquirers, or in conducting meetings for\r\nconference and prayer. The informality and freedom of these meetings\r\nmade them attractive. They were probably quite as useful as the more\r\nregular ministrations of the pulpit. The speaker can say that he never\r\nvisited a more solemn place than the old district school-house--which\r\nstood where the brick school-house now stands--often was, on a Sunday\r\nevening during the progress of a conference meeting. A distinguished\r\nprofessor of a neighboring college, who was here in 1815, says that\r\n'The evidence of an increasing seriousness among the students at\r\nlarge, in that revival, was first shown, so far as I can recollect, by\r\nthe more crowded attendance at these meetings.' Not that the more\r\nformal services of the Sabbath were not also impressive and\r\nprofitable. The same gentleman says of the preaching of Professor\r\nShurtleff at this time: 'The general impression made on me by several\r\nof his sermons I remember to the present day. I liked to hear him\r\npreach, even before I took any especial interest in religion as a\r\npersonal concern. His sermon on the text, \"The harvest is past, the\r\nsummer is ended,\" etc., produced a deep effect at the time of its\r\ndelivery which was not soon forgotten. I remember the stillness and\r\nsolemnity of the audience. This sermon must have been delivered some\r\nlittle time before the revival.' The same gentleman further states,\r\nthat 'During the whole of this revival, and the gathering in of the\r\nfruits of it into the church, Professor Shurtleff was the leading\r\ninstrument of the work, so far as human agency was concerned. He went\r\ninto it with his whole heart. I have seen him and his excellent wife\r\nalmost overpowered with joy when told of a new case of conversion\r\namong the students. He did a great deal--all that one man could do, as\r\nit seemed to me--to promote the good work by his own personal\r\nefforts.' It is in the power of the speaker to give similar testimony\r\nrespecting the revival of 1821.\r\n\r\n\"When Professor Shurtleff entered upon the duties of his\r\nprofessorship, and for many years afterward, he met with much\r\nopposition. But his position was constantly growing stronger, both as\r\nit respects the sympathy of his Christian brethren and the clergy, and\r\nhis popularity as an instructor. I have not been able to learn that\r\nthere was a whisper of discontent with his instructions during the\r\nwhole of the period from 1804 to 1827. The testimony of one of the\r\nbest students of the Class of 1816 is, that 'As an instructor,\r\nparticularly in Moral Philosophy, he was much thought of; and we were\r\ncareful never to miss one of his recitations on this subject. His way\r\nof putting questions, and answering such as were proposed to himself,\r\nshowed great judgment and shrewdness.' Quite a number of persons in\r\nthe classes for seven or eight years following the time here referred\r\nto, were preëminent as scholars and as men. May not the fact be partly\r\naccounted for by the impulse and guidance of the mind of this\r\ninstructor? He constituted a large portion of the faculty from 1815 to\r\n1819, there being at that time only two professors,--Professor Adams\r\nand Professor Shurtleff. The graduates of the college who had been his\r\npupils were never backward in acknowledging their obligations to him.\r\n\r\n\"In 1810, Professor Shurtleff was united in marriage with Miss Anna\r\nPope, only daughter of Rev. Joseph Pope of Spencer, Mass. Of her he\r\nsaid, 'She was truly an helpmeet--one who did me good and not evil all\r\nthe days of her life.' By her vivacity and cheerfulness she was\r\neminently fitted to comfort him in his hours of suffering and\r\ndepression. But it pleased God to take her from him in March, 1826,\r\nafter having enjoyed with her, during sixteen years, a degree of\r\ndomestic happiness which rarely falls to the lot of man. He also lost\r\ntwo children, sons, in 1820, after a brief illness. Respecting the\r\noldest, he had already begun to indulge very pleasing anticipations,\r\nalthough he was less than five years old at the time of his decease.\r\nLittle did the speaker then know, when helping to carry to the grave\r\nthe remains of these children, who, if they had survived, would now\r\nhave been men of mature age, what hopes he was assisting to bury! But\r\nwho knows the future? It was better they should die, than that they\r\nshould live to dishonor him and themselves. The husband and father\r\nmourned incessantly, though not without resignation, for these\r\nbereavements, till the time of his own death.\r\n\r\n\"In 1825, Professor Shurtleff was in very feeble health, from the\r\nspring till Commencement. The Trustees adjourned at that time to\r\nreassemble in November, supposing it might be necessary then to\r\nappoint another professor of Divinity. But by the blessing of God on\r\nmedical advice and careful nursing, he was able to resume instruction\r\nbefore the meeting of the Trustees.\r\n\r\n\"In January, 1827, Professor Shurtleff was transferred from the\r\nprofessorship of Divinity to one newly established, of Moral\r\nPhilosophy and Political Economy, which he filled till the year 1838,\r\nwhen, by his own resignation, his active labors in the college ceased.\r\nIt was understood, when this appointment was made, that Professor\r\nShurtleff should instruct in all the Senior classes, and should also\r\nhear the recitations of other classes in particular branches. During\r\nthe last half of this period, he preached in vacant neighboring\r\nparishes. No particular account of the literary labors of these years\r\ncan be required. Any one of them may be regarded as a fair sample of\r\nthe rest. A member of the class of 1828 can testify that that class\r\ngreatly enjoyed his instructions. We never heard the summons to the\r\nrecitation-room without pleasure. We were always interested and\r\nexcited, always profited. The questions were put by the professor in\r\nthe plainest Saxon. They were well adapted to develop the knowledge or\r\nthe ignorance of the student, as the case might be, but not to give\r\nhim undue assistance. If there was anything in the text-book which was\r\nobscure, the questions made it plain. A clearly wrong opinion advanced\r\nby an author was briefly, yet thoroughly, exposed. His own opinions\r\nwere lucidly stated and sustained, and for the time being, at least,\r\nwe seldom saw reason to differ from him. The recitation was enlivened\r\nwith anecdote, illustration, and wit, and never dragged heavily. If\r\nour objections were sometimes curtly silenced, it was so effectually\r\nand handsomely done that we bore it with perfect good-nature. He ever\r\nlent a willing ear to our real difficulties, and assisted in their\r\nremoval. Together with unusual freedom in the mode of conducting the\r\nrecitations, there was good order and earnest attention to the subject\r\nin hand. He knew how to control us, while he had with us all the\r\nsympathy of a young man and an equal. I think it was the opinion of\r\nthe class that Professor Shurtleff, in his ripe manhood, had few\r\nequals as an instructor.\r\n\r\n\"At the time of his retirement, in 1838, Dr. Shurtleff had been in the\r\nservice of the college thirty-eight years. After what manner he has\r\nlived among us since that time, most of this audience know. He has not\r\nbeen noticeably active in the affairs of the village, but when you\r\nhave met him in private intercourse, you have known that he retained\r\nthe fine social qualities--the love of story-telling, and the keen,\r\nyet harmless wit--for which he was always remarkable. Those whose\r\nmemory goes back thirty years, must have noticed, I think, that he\r\nbecame more uniformly serene and cheerful in the latter part of his\r\nlife. The old graduates of the college who revisited the place know\r\nhow cordially he received them, and with what hearty zest he recalled\r\nwith them the scenes of their college days. He continued to be deeply\r\ninterested in the prosperity of the college, and he was the means of\r\neliciting in its behalf the interest and the benevolence of his\r\nfriends. He continued the habit, commenced at an early period, of\r\nassisting students who were in needy circumstances. These were\r\nobjects of benevolence toward which he was naturally drawn. In his\r\nfeelings he never grew old, but carried forward the vivacity of youth\r\ninto old age; and always enjoyed the society of the young. He loved to\r\nhave young men about him; and he has thus, by his unobtrusive\r\ncharities and counsels, and his interesting and instructive\r\nconversation, been a benefactor to a large number of students. The\r\nspiritual welfare of the college was near his heart. He had passed\r\nthrough many revivals of religion, and he longed for the return of\r\nsuch seasons. He devoutly observed the days set apart for prayer for\r\ncolleges, and, as you remember, often urged the students, assembled on\r\nthose occasions, to give their hearts to God.\r\n\r\n\"When he left his post as an instructor he was sixty-five years old.\r\nAfter this he had more than twenty-two years of leisure, during which\r\nhe retained, in a remarkable degree, the vigor of his intellectual\r\npowers. But he had good and sufficient reasons, as he judged, for his\r\nresignation; and no new and suitable field of labor presenting itself\r\nto a man who wanted but a few years of threescore and ten, he could\r\nenjoy the offered leisure with a good conscience, occupying it with\r\nsuch pursuits as his taste suggested. Even at the time when his labors\r\nwere the most multiplied, and the church and the college were\r\nsuccessively engaged in bitter controversy, he had but little to do\r\nwith administrative and practical matters. Even then a life of\r\nreflection appeared to be more attractive than a life of action. And\r\nwhen his public duties were ended, he naturally chose such a life. He\r\nwas still intellectually active. He could not let his faculties sink\r\ninto sluggish repose if he would. His temperament would not suffer it.\r\nIf he was not a hard student, he was, what he had always been, a\r\nthinking man to the last.\"\r\n\r\nIn a published notice of Professor Shurtleff, by Professor (now\r\nPresident) Brown, we find the following language:\r\n\r\n\"The life of Dr. Shurtleff extended over the largest and most\r\nimportant part of that of the institution itself. For nearly twenty\r\nyears he was college preacher, and at the same time pastor of the\r\nchurch on Hanover Plain,--during which period more than two hundred\r\npersons connected themselves with the church, a large proportion of\r\nthem by original profession. In the contest of the college with the\r\nState, he and the late venerable Professor Adams, with the president,\r\nconstituted the permanent Faculty for instruction and government. Upon\r\nthe issues then presented he exerted a full measure of influence,\r\nthough it was comparatively quiet and private.\r\n\r\n\"As a professor, Dr. Shurtleff had some remarkable qualities. He\r\npossessed a mind of extraordinary subtleness and acuteness, ever\r\nalert, active and ingenious. Whatever he saw, he saw distinctly, and\r\nwas able, with equal clearness, to express to another. If a student\r\nwere really perplexed, he knew how to relieve him by a pertinent\r\nexample or illustration, but it was generally done by a question or a\r\nsuggestion which demanded the activity of the student's own mind, and\r\ndisciplined while it, helped him. If a pupil, on the other hand, were\r\ncaptious, or conceited, he was apt to find himself, before he\r\nsuspected it, inextricably entangled in a web of contradictions, where\r\nhe was sometimes left till he came to a sense of his weakness, or till\r\nhe was dismissed with the benign declaration that 'he might sit.'\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Shurtleff's wit was sharp and pungent, and on any occasion which\r\ninvolved the exercise of it he was quite equal to his part. He\r\nsometimes engaged in controversy, and versed as he was in all logical\r\nart, those who encountered him once were seldom anxious to provoke a\r\nsecond contest. His opinions, both religious and philosophical, were\r\nearly settled and firmly held. He was in nothing given to change; his\r\nfriends were generally the friends of his life, and those who were\r\nfamiliar with his habits of thought could easily tell where, upon any\r\ngiven question, he would probably be found.\r\n\r\n\"His interest in young men was a noticeable trait in Dr. Shurtleff's\r\ncharacter, while preacher to the college; the effect of his private\r\nconversations and friendly advice was almost equal to that of his\r\npublic ministrations. His quiet study was often the scene of meetings\r\nfor prayer or religious conversation from which were carried away\r\ninfluences for good, never to be forgotten, and for which many were\r\ngrateful to their dying day.\r\n\r\n\"The efforts of deserving young men to obtain a liberal education\r\nalways excited his sympathy, and there has seldom been a time for many\r\nyears when some such one has not been a member of his own family,\r\naided and encouraged by his kindness. The number thus assisted no one\r\ncan now tell, nor probably could he himself. It was greater than most\r\npersons would think possible.\r\n\r\n\"The last twenty years of his life Dr. Shurtleff spent in dignified\r\nretirement, in the enjoyment of a competency, and in full exercise of\r\nhis faculties. He especially enjoyed the visits of former pupils, no\r\none of whom seemed to be lost from his retentive memory, and the\r\nannual commencements were always exhilarating reunions to him. His\r\nconversation, at such times especially, abounded in anecdote and\r\nreminiscences of earlier days, and his cheerfulness survived to the\r\nend. He has seldom, of late years, taken part in any public service,\r\nthe last time he did so being at the meeting of the alumni of\r\nDartmouth in 1859, to initiate measures for properly noticing the\r\ndeath of Mr. Choate.\"\r\n\r\nA volume would be required to set forth adequately the value of the\r\npublic services of this distinguished educator, who acted a most\r\nimportant part in strengthening the foundations and adorning the\r\nsuperstructure of a leading literary institution. Professor Shurtleff\r\ndied at Hanover, February 4, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR EBENEZER ADAMS.--PROFESSOR ZEPHANIAH S. MOORE.--PROFESSOR\r\nCHARLES B. HADDOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Ebenezer Adams succeeded Professor Hubbard. From a reliable\r\nsource we have received, in substance, the following statements:\r\n\r\n\"Ebenezer Adams, the son of Ephraim and Rebecca (Locke) Adams, was\r\nborn at New Ipswich, N. H., October 2, 1765. His father was a farmer\r\nin moderate circumstances, and having a large family of children,\r\nnineteen in all, he could not give them many educational advantages,\r\nbut they shared in such as were commonly enjoyed in those days. The\r\nsubject of this sketch, however, earnestly desired something more; he\r\nhad set his heart upon obtaining a higher education, and ultimately\r\nsucceeded in doing so. After becoming nearly or quite of age, he\r\ncommenced preparation for Dartmouth College, which he entered in 1787,\r\ngraduating with honor in 1791, and in the following year he became\r\npreceptor of Leicester Academy, where he remained fourteen years,\r\nlaboring faithfully and very successfully in the instruction of those\r\nunder his care. While there he married, in 1795, Miss Alice Frink, of\r\nRutland, Mass., who died early, leaving five young children. In 1806\r\nhe removed to Portland, where he engaged as teacher in the academy,\r\nand it was while residing there that he came under the pastoral care\r\nof Rev. Dr. Payson, and in a time of general revival he was deeply\r\ninterested in religious truth and became a subject of renewing grace.\r\nHe publicly professed his faith in Christ and united with Dr. Payson's\r\nchurch. While there he formed a second marriage with Miss Beulah\r\nMinot, of Concord, Mass., who became the mother of his two youngest\r\nchildren, and the subsequent year he taught in Phillips Academy,\r\nExeter, but he did not long remain there.\r\n\r\n\"In 1809, he was called to Dartmouth College, where for one year he\r\nwas Professor of Languages, and was then transferred to the\r\nprofessorship of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Astronomy, which\r\nhe held until the appointment of a successor, in 1833. As a teacher he\r\nwas faithful, patient, laborious, earnestly desiring the best good of\r\nhis pupils, whose affection he often succeeded in gaining, their\r\nesteem always. Possessed of much intellectual force, of sound and\r\nvaried attainments in learning, which he had the happy faculty of\r\nimparting to others clearly and distinctly, he was thus eminently\r\nfitted for the position of instructor, so many years occupied by him.\r\nHe was truly devoted to the interests of the college, and ever ready\r\nto make efforts and sacrifices for it, and in those dark days, when\r\nits fate hung in suspense, he was deeply anxious, and had no small\r\nshare in aiding and sustaining it through the struggle. During\r\nPresident Brown's illness, and after his death, for more than two\r\nyears in all, he filled the office of president in addition to his\r\nown, thus having a great increase of care and responsibility, and the\r\nsame thing occurred on other occasions, when the college was\r\ntemporarily without a head. He did not enjoy the situation, for while\r\nhe truly delighted in teaching, he found the enforcement of discipline\r\nvery irksome; still he was faithful and energetic in it when it became\r\nhis duty.\r\n\r\n\"He was interested in every good cause, philanthropic and religious,\r\nespecially in the Bible Society, of which he was for many years the\r\npresiding officer in New Hampshire; in the Colonization Society, which\r\nhe then thought the only possible agency for removing the curse of\r\nSlavery; in Foreign Missions and in Temperance, of which he was an\r\nearnest and able advocate. In this connection it should be mentioned\r\nthat he was Trustee and Treasurer of Kimball Union Academy, at\r\nMeriden, almost from its first commencement until nearly the close of\r\nhis life, and in the success end prosperity of that institution he\r\nalways felt a deep interest, and labored to promote its welfare.\r\n\r\n\"After his resignation in 1833, he devoted much of his leisure to\r\nobjects of public interest, to the affairs of the town and village, in\r\nwhich several important trusts were committed to him, and of the\r\nchurch, in which for years he had worthily filled the office of\r\ndeacon. In these he was actively and usefully employed, even to the\r\nlast, and thus, in the unfailing resource of reading and study which\r\nhe enjoyed, in the society of attached friends, and of the dear family\r\ncircle, those closing years of his life passed away cheerfully,\r\nhappily, leaving blessed memories behind them. He was quite active in\r\nhis habits and usually of firm and vigorous health. It almost seemed\r\nas if he had been stricken down in his full strength, so sudden and\r\nshort was his last illness. A heart-disease, of which he had suffered\r\nsome symptoms a few months before, attacked him with great violence,\r\nand after ten days of intense suffering and distress, during which he\r\nmanifested a true submission to God's will, and a calm reliance in\r\nChrist, his atoning Saviour, he 'fell asleep in Jesus,' August 15,\r\n1841.\r\n\r\n\"The college, the church, the village, mourned his departure, but\r\nnowhere was it so deeply felt as in the home which had so long been\r\nblest with his presence and affection. For in all family relations he\r\nwas most truly kind and affectionate, in social life, genial and\r\nfriendly, especially, even to the last, delighting in little children,\r\nand in the society of the young, generous and public-spirited, of\r\nspotless integrity in business affairs, faithful, earnest and skillful\r\nas a teacher, in all his ways a sincere and humble follower of the\r\nLord Jesus.\"\r\n\r\nHis associate, Professor Stowe, says:\r\n\r\n\"Professor Adams was one of the stoutest of that noble band of men who\r\nupheld Dartmouth College in the great crisis through which it passed,\r\nand thus established, not only the principles on which that venerable\r\nand most useful institution maintained its existence, but gave the\r\nfoundation for permanency to all other educational institutions in our\r\ncountry, for it was the decision of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, in the Dartmouth College case, that became the _magna charta_\r\nof all our colleges.\r\n\r\n\"Sailors speak of 'men who in a storm can ascend to the mast-head, and\r\nhold on with their eyelids' while they use both hands to adjust the\r\nrigging. Such were the men who saved Dartmouth College during that\r\ngreat conflict.\r\n\r\n\"A little girl once said that if God really did make the whole\r\nuniverse in six days, she should like to know what he stood on while\r\nhe was making it.\r\n\r\n\"Such a question has often occurred to me in thinking of that period\r\nin the history of Dartmouth College. What had the champions of the\r\ncollege to stand on? But they did stand, and did their work\r\ncompletely, and for all time.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Adams had just the qualities for such an emergency. His was\r\nthe sturdy self-reliance, the unshrinking courage, the indomitable\r\nperseverance, and the unwavering faith in God, which holds what it has\r\nand carries what it holds. His was not the coward's courage, which\r\nconsists in the denying of the danger, but the courage of the brave\r\nman, which sees the danger and faces it.\"\r\n\r\nA pupil says:\r\n\r\n\"Professor Adams was 'a manly man,' well-proportioned,\r\nbroad-shouldered, with a commanding presence and amiable countenance.\r\nHe was bold, earnest, energetic, persevering; artless, and honest as\r\nthe day. He said exactly what he meant. His mental vision was clear,\r\nstrong, and accurate. Imagination was never active; oratory was not\r\nhis forte. Demonstrative evidence suited him best. In his religious\r\ncharacter he was conscientious, devout, and reverent, never excited\r\nnor sentimental.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn \"Sprague's Annals of the American Pulpit\" we find this account of\r\nProf. Zephaniah Swift Moore. \"He was the son of Judah and Mary (Swift)\r\nMoore, and was born at Palmer, Mass., November 20, 1770. His parents\r\nwere in the middle walks of life, and were much esteemed for their\r\nintegrity and piety. When he was seven or eight years old, he removed\r\nwith his father's family to Wilmington, Vt., where he worked upon a\r\nfarm till he was about eighteen. From his early childhood he evinced\r\ngreat inquisitiveness of mind, and an uncommon thirst for knowledge;\r\nin consequence of which, his parents consented to aid him in acquiring\r\na collegiate education. Having prosecuted his preparatory studies at\r\nan academy in Bennington, Vt., he entered Dartmouth College, when he\r\nwas in his nineteenth year. He graduated in 1793, and delivered on\r\nthe occasion a philosophical oration on the 'causes and general\r\nphenomena of earthquakes,' which was received with marked approbation.\r\n\r\n\"On leaving college, he took charge of an academy at Londonderry, N.\r\nH., where he gained the reputation of an able and faithful teacher.\r\nHaving occupied this post for a year, he repaired to Somers, Conn.,\r\nand commenced the study of Theology under the direction of the Rev.\r\nDr. Charles Backus; and, having gone through the usual course of\r\npreparation for the ministry, was licensed to preach by a committee of\r\nthe Association of Tolland County, February 3, 1796. After preaching\r\nto good acceptance in various places, and receiving several\r\ninvitations to a permanent settlement in the ministry, he finally\r\naccepted a call from the Congregational church and congregation in\r\nLeicester, Mass. Here his labors proved alike acceptable and useful.\r\nVery considerable additions were made to the church, and the spirit\r\nand power of religion became increasingly visible under his\r\nministrations. During a part of the time that he resided at Leicester,\r\nhe joined to his duties as a minister those of principal of the\r\nLeicester Academy; and here, also, he acquitted himself with much\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\n\"In October, 1811, he accepted the chair of professor of Languages in\r\nDartmouth College. Here he was greatly respected as a man, a teacher,\r\nand a preacher; and if his attainments in his department were not of\r\nthe very highest order, they were at least such as to secure both his\r\nrespectability and usefulness.\r\n\r\n\"In 1815, he was elected to the presidency of Williams College, then\r\nvacant by the resignation of Dr. Fitch. He accepted the appointment,\r\nand was regularly inducted into office at the annual Commencement in\r\nSeptember of that year. Shortly after his removal to Williamstown,\r\nDartmouth College, which he had just left, conferred upon him the\r\ndegree of Doctor of Divinity. He adorned this new station, as he had\r\ndone those which he had previously occupied. His connection with the\r\ncollege was attended by some circumstances of peculiar embarrassment,\r\nin consequence of an effort on the part of the Trustees to remove the\r\ncollege to Northampton or some other town in Hampshire County. The\r\nmeasure failed in consequence of the refusal of the Legislature to\r\nsanction it. Dr. Moore, however, decidedly favored it from the\r\nbeginning, but in a manner that reflected not in the least upon his\r\nChristian integrity and honor.\r\n\r\n\"In the spring of 1821, the collegiate institution at Amherst, Mass.,\r\nhaving been founded, he was invited to become its President, and was\r\ninaugurated as such in September following. The institution, then in\r\nits infancy, and contending with a powerful public opinion, and even\r\nwith the Legislature itself, for its very existence, put in\r\nrequisition all his energies; and the ultimate success of the\r\nenterprise was no doubt to be referred, in no small degree, to his\r\ndiscreet, earnest, and untiring efforts. In addition to his\r\nappropriate duties as president and as chairman of the Board of\r\nTrustees, he heard the recitations of the Senior class, and part of\r\nthe recitations of the Sophomore class, besides taking occasional\r\nagencies with a view to increase the funds of the institution. His\r\nconstitution, naturally strong, was over-taxed by the efforts which he\r\nfelt himself called to make, and had begun perceptibly to yield,\r\nbefore the last violent attack of disease which terminated his life.\r\n\r\n\"On Wednesday, the 25th of June, 1823, he was seized with a bilious\r\ncolic, which reached a fatal termination on the Monday following.\r\nDuring the brief period of his illness, the greatest anxiety prevailed\r\nin the college, and unceasing prayer was offered in his behalf. His\r\nown mind was perfectly tranquil, and he anticipated the closing scene\r\nand passed through it without a word or look that told of\r\napprehension. In the very moment of breathing out his spirit, he\r\nuttered in a whisper,--'God is my hope, my shield, my exceeding great\r\nreward.' The funeral solemnities were attended on the Wednesday\r\nfollowing, and an appropriate sermon was delivered on the occasion by\r\nthe Rev. Dr. Snell, of North Brookfield.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Moore lived to celebrate the first anniversary of the\r\ninstitution, and to see more than eighty of its students professedly\r\nreligious, and preparing for extensive usefulness among their fellow\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\"Shortly after his settlement at Leicester, he was married to Phebe,\r\ndaughter of Thomas Drury, of Ward, now Auburn, Mass., who survived\r\nhim. They had no children.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Moore published an Oration at Worcester on the 5th of July, 1802;\r\nMassachusetts Election Sermon, 1818; an Address to the public in\r\nrespect to Amherst College, 1823; a Sermon at the ordination of Dorus\r\nClark, Blandford, 1823.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE REV. EMERSON DAVIS, D.D.\r\n\r\n    \"Westfield, Mass., November 16, 1849.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir: You have requested me to give you my impressions and\r\nrecollections of President Moore. They are all exceedingly pleasant,\r\nand yet I must say he was a man of such equanimity of temper and\r\nuniformity of life, that I am unable to single out one act or saying\r\nof his that produced a deeper impression than others.\r\n\r\n\"My first introduction to him was in the spring of 1818, when I was\r\nushered into his study with a letter of recommendation for admission\r\nto Williams College. It was to me a fearful moment, but the cordial\r\nmanner in which I was received, and his kind inquiries after his\r\nfriend who had furnished me with a letter, made me at once easy in his\r\npresence. I found that he had the heart of a man, and through an\r\nacquaintance of several years, to the time of his death, he manifested\r\nthe same kindness and cordiality that he did the first time I saw him.\r\n\r\n\"He was a man of medium stature, rather corpulent, his complexion\r\nsallow, the top of his head nearly bald, there being a slight\r\nsprinkling of hair between the forehead and crown. His voice, though\r\nnot loud, was clear and pleasant, and in animated conversation and in\r\nthe pulpit pitched upon the tenor key.\r\n\r\n\"He was dignified in his appearance, serious in his aspect,\r\ninstructive and agreeable in his conversation, kind and benevolent in\r\nhis feelings, modest and unassuming in his manners, deliberate and\r\ncautious in coming to a conclusion, but firm and determined when his\r\nposition was taken. If a student had at any time spoken against him,\r\nhe would have been regarded as a rebel against law and order. In\r\nmanaging cases of discipline, he was calm and entirely self-possessed.\r\n\r\nIn preaching, he had very little action; and yet there was an\r\nimpressiveness in his manner that fixed the attention of his hearers.\r\nIn the more animated parts of his discourse, his utterance became\r\nmore rapid, and the sound of his voice shrill and tremulous, showing\r\nthat he felt deeply the force of the sentiments he uttered. In his\r\nreligious views, I know not that he differed from the great mass of\r\nthe orthodox clergy of New England, of his day.\r\n\r\n\"Such are my recollections of President Moore.\r\n\r\n    \"Yours truly,\r\n    \"Emerson Davis.\"\r\n\r\nThe following tribute to one of Dartmouth's most eminent and honored\r\nteachers is from a \"Discourse\" by Professor (now President) Brown.\r\n\r\n\"Charles Bricket Haddock was born in that part of Salisbury, N. H.,\r\nwhich is now Franklin, June 20, 1796. His mother was Abigail Webster,\r\nan older sister of Ezekiel and Daniel Webster. She had two children,\r\nCharles and William. She was a person of uncommon excellence and\r\nloveliness, a favorite with her brothers, who always spoke of her with\r\ngreat affection. She was a religious woman, and on her death-bed\r\nmanifested great solicitude for her sons, especially dedicating the\r\noldest, Charles, to the Christian ministry. This expression of feeling\r\nwas almost the only recollection which Mr. Haddock had of his mother.\r\n\r\n\"The place of his birth was retired, but full of rural beauty; the\r\nrushing Merrimac-making sweet music of a summer evening, the broad\r\nintervals basking in the summer sun, the granite mountains 'dumbly\r\nkeeping watch all round,' from whose summits, looking almost to the\r\nWhite Hills on one side, and almost to the sea on the other, you would\r\nbehold a landscape picturesque and lovely beyond the power of\r\ndescription. The quiet scenes of his youth, the simple pleasures, and\r\nthe common amusements of village life, varied with few excitements,\r\ncould not have been without their effect upon the mind of a sensitive\r\nboy. To what age he was left to these alone, I do not know.\r\n\r\n\"He fitted for college mainly at the academy in Salisbury, and entered\r\nin 1812. Nature had done more for him than his instructors, and he\r\nvery soon took the position, which he ever maintained, as intellectual\r\nleader in a class, which, though small, numbered among its members\r\nseveral young men of distinguished ability. In that little community\r\nhe was at once the best scholar and the most popular man. 'In looks,'\r\nwrites one of his class-mates,[41] 'Haddock was decidedly the most\r\nstriking man in the class. He was tall and well-proportioned. He had\r\nan intellectual cast of features, a well-chiseled profile,--and\r\naltogether you might pronounce him a man intended for a scholar, and\r\ndestined, if he lived, to make his mark in the world. I, who entered\r\ncollege a mere boy, singled him out the first day. He was always an\r\nindustrious student. He never failed of a recitation, so far as I can\r\nremember, and he never failed to be prepared for it.'\r\n\r\n      [41] Professor Torrey, of Burlington.\r\n\r\n\"Adding thus to the distinction of attainment and scholarship so much\r\nbeauty of person, so much modesty, gentleness, and propriety of\r\ndemeanor, it was natural that he should be regarded as a model young\r\nman, nor was there wanting that profounder moral element, without\r\nwhich no character can be complete.\r\n\r\n\"The year 1815 was memorable in the religious history of the college.\r\nThe period immediately preceding had been marked by unusual religious\r\ndepression. In some classes only one person, and but a few in any of\r\nthem, made profession of a serious religious purpose. Of this small\r\nnumber, there were some, however, whose feelings were deep, and whose\r\nlives were exemplary. To them,--not more, perhaps, than eight or ten\r\nin all,--was due, under the Divine favor, the moral regeneration of\r\nthe college. First among those who, in that 'Great awakening,' avowed\r\nhis purpose of a new life, was Mr. Haddock, then in the summer of his\r\nJunior year. The avowal was open, unreserved, and decisive, and, it is\r\nalmost unnecessary to add, produced a strong sensation. From that time\r\nno one in college exerted a more positive influence in favor of\r\npersonal religion, and not a few traced their own most serious\r\nthoughts to his example and to his faithfulness.\r\n\r\n\"This change in his feelings naturally determined his course in life,\r\nand immediately after taking his first degree he entered the seminary\r\nat Andover as a student in Theology. Here he pursued the profound and\r\ndifficult studies of his profession with a more than ordinary breadth\r\nof scholarship, mingling classical and literary studies with those of\r\ntheology, but entering with zeal and a chastened enthusiasm into all\r\nthe duties and requirements of the place.\r\n\r\n\"He remained at Andover about two years, when, on account of a\r\nthreatened pulmonary complaint, he made a journey to the South, going\r\nas far as Savannah, and spending the winter in various parts of the\r\nSouthern States. Having performed a considerable part of the tour on\r\nhorseback, he returned, in 1819, invigorated in health, and with a\r\nmind enlarged and liberalized by what were then quite unusual\r\nopportunities of observation and society, and was at once appointed to\r\nthe newly established chair of Rhetoric, at the early age of\r\ntwenty-three years. The college had but just gained the victory in its\r\ndesperate struggle for existence. It was poor, but hopeful, and it\r\nmoved forward with a policy of enlargement, determined to keep pace\r\nwith all advancing learning and culture.\r\n\r\n\"Before that time, the duties of the new department had been\r\ndistributed among all the college officers, and necessarily must have\r\nlacked something in fullness and method. No other New England college,\r\nexcept Harvard and Yale, then possessed such an officer, and the first\r\nappointment to the post in New Haven bears date but two years\r\nearlier.\"\r\n\r\n\"As an instructor, Professor Haddock was one of the best I ever knew.\r\nI never knew a better. It is with unfeigned gratitude that I remember\r\nmy obligations to him, and I know I speak for thousands. As a critic,\r\nhe was discriminating and quietly suggestive, guided by a taste that\r\nwas nearly immaculate. His scholarship was unobtrusive, and his manner\r\nwithout ostentation. He made no pretense of knowledge, but it was\r\nalways sufficient, always fresh, always sound. The range of his\r\nthought was broad. His mind was versatile and active. You could hardly\r\nfind a subject with which he was not somewhat familiar, or in which he\r\nwould not readily become interested. His opinions were never\r\nfantastic, nor exaggerated, nor disproportioned. He was not, perhaps,\r\nso exacting nor so stimulating a teacher as some, but he was careful,\r\nclear, distinct, and encouraging. He saw the difficulty in the mind\r\nof the pupil, if there was one, adapted himself with admirable\r\nfacility to his wants, and by a lucid statement, a test question, or a\r\ndistinct suggestion, would often free a subject from its obscurity, so\r\nthat the way would all be in clear sunlight. He felt that, in\r\neducation, the best results are not produced violently, but by\r\ninfluences quiet and protracted, gradually, but potently, moulding the\r\naffections and the life, 'finely touching the spirit to fine issues.'\"\r\n\r\n\"In 1846, Professor Haddock published a volume of 'Addresses and\r\nMiscellaneous Writings,' gathered from reviews, and from his speeches\r\nbefore the New Hampshire Legislature, and on various public occasions.\r\nThese are marked by the peculiar completeness and finish which\r\ncharacterized all his productions. There is in them no superfluous\r\nword, no affectation, no straining after effect, but much that is wise\r\nand everything that is tasteful. Yet, interesting as they are, I\r\nhardly feel as if they give an adequate expression of his rich and\r\nvaried abilities. His more recent writings,--notes of foreign travels,\r\nlectures, and discourses,--he had begun to prepare for the press, when\r\nhe was so suddenly taken from us, and I am glad to hope that some of\r\nthem may yet see the light.\r\n\r\n\"For many years Professor Haddock acted as secretary of the New\r\nHampshire Education Society. In discharge of the duties of this\r\noffice, sometimes little more than a sinecure, he made it an object to\r\nbring before the society, in his annual reports, subjects of permanent\r\ninterest. In looking them over, I perceive such topics as these:\r\n'Objections to Charitable Education,' 'The Standard of Education for\r\nthe Pulpit,' 'The Influence of Educated Mind,' 'Personal\r\nQualifications for the Pulpit,' 'Manual Labor Institutions,' 'The\r\nClergy the Natural Advisers of Young Men,' 'Personal Piety in\r\nCandidates for the Christian Ministry,' 'Wisdom in Clergymen,' 'The\r\nEloquence of the Pulpit as affected by Ministerial Character.' These\r\naddresses, somewhat brief, never impassioned, are full of excellent\r\nsuggestions, both to the laity and the clergy. They abound in\r\npractical wisdom, and any one may read them with profit.\r\n\r\n\"In all his writings his style was unambitious, unaffected, chaste,\r\npure, and transparent as crystal. It was true to his subject and\r\nhimself. If not fervid and vehement, it was because of his moderation\r\nand self-restraint; if not pungent and dogmatic, it was marked by\r\nsustained earnestness and finished beauty. If he had not predominantly\r\nthat power which is called by the older rhetoricians amplification, he\r\neminently had another, as rarely met with in perfection, the power of\r\nexact, unincumbered, logical statement. There was sometimes in him a\r\nreticence as admirable as it was unique. You wondered why he did not\r\nsay more, and yet if he had, it would only have injured the effect.\r\nThe word exactly fitted the sentiment. The idea was insphered in the\r\nexpression. There was no excess or extravagance in anything he did or\r\nsaid. His thoughts glided softly and sweetly from his pen, as a\r\nrivulet from a silver fountain.\r\n\r\n\"I have sometimes thought that Professor Haddock's intellectual powers\r\nwere nowhere displayed to more advantage than in the mingled grave and\r\ngay, learned and mirthful intercourse of social life. The very tones\r\nof his voice, sympathetic and attractive, the absence of dogmatism, or\r\nsuperciliousness, or self-assertion,--the mingled deference and\r\nindependence, the clear and sustained thought, the ready insight, the\r\nquick apprehension of proprieties, the intelligent, dexterous, but\r\nnever caustic reply, the sure appreciation of the feelings of others,\r\nand the power of making them, even the lowliest, feel that what they\r\nsaid was listened to with interest,--the sense of the droll and\r\nludicrous, the responsive laughter, not boisterous, but hearty,\r\nbringing tears into the eyes,--all gave a peculiar charm to this form\r\nof intercourse. It was a ministry of beneficence, diffusing kindness,\r\nintelligence, and gentleness, enlivening many a dull hour, filling\r\nmany a vacant mind, and inspiring many a worthy purpose.\r\n\r\n\"'Great openness and candor, good sense, the reading of a scholar, the\r\noriginality of a man who sometimes thought for himself, aspirations\r\nafter excellence much higher than those of many others,--all these\r\ntraits came out in his familiar talks, in which he rather unbent than\r\nexerted himself; at the same time he was as gentle and attentive a\r\nlistener as a man could wish, a truly sociable being, with whom you\r\ncould talk all day, and then all night, and never feel weary.'[42]\r\n\r\n      [42] Professor Torrey.\r\n\r\n\"In 1850, he received from Mr. Fillmore the appointment of _Chargé\r\nd'Affaires_ at the court of Portugal, and in the spring of 1851 sailed\r\nfor Lisbon, by way of England. I have the best means of knowing that,\r\nwhile at Lisbon, his intercourse and influence with the Court, and\r\nwith the representatives of all the great powers, was most acceptable\r\nand most salutary. His residence in Portugal was in many ways\r\ndelightful. The delicious climate, the cultivated and refined society\r\nof the diplomatic circle, temporary rest from labor, and change of\r\nscene and occupations, were all sources of pleasure. Yet here he was\r\ntouched by one of his deepest sorrows, for at Lisbon, November, 1851,\r\n'by the side of Philip Doddridge, in the English cemetery,' he buried\r\nhis youngest son, a beautiful boy of eleven years.\r\n\r\n\"He returned from Portugal early in 1856, after an absence of nearly\r\nfour years; and, having previously terminated his connection with the\r\ncollege, spent the remainder of his life at West Lebanon.\"\r\n\r\nProf. N. S. Folsom says:\r\n\r\n\"Professor Haddock was the 'orator suavi loquenti ore,' and he was\r\nmuch more than this. Both by precept and example he raised the\r\nstandard of speaking and writing among the students, and stimulated\r\nthem to the pursuit of a manly eloquence. There also prevailed a very\r\ngeneral conviction of his sincerity and moral earnestness, and of his\r\ninterest in our successful career in life. The themes he gave led us\r\nto discriminate both intellectually and morally, and if he thought the\r\ntheme worthily treated, a kind note in the margin of the sheet was\r\nsure to tell us so. The spirit in which he met the class was that of\r\nthe closing paragraph in his Phi Beta Kappa Oration of 1825: 'Young\r\nmen of my country, God has given you a noble theatre, and called you\r\ninto life at the most interesting of all times. Forget not that you\r\nare descendants of men who solemnly dedicated themselves and their\r\nposterity through all coming time to the cause of free and enlightened\r\nreason--unrestricted divine reason--the portion inscribed on our\r\nhearts of the universal law, 'whose seat is the bosom of God, her\r\nvoice the harmony of the world.' Occasionally he preached in the\r\nHanover village church, where the students attended. He never had so\r\nmuch as a scrap of any notes before him; and this was his habit also\r\nat White River, where he steadily officiated. I need not add that the\r\nstudents always were greatly delighted when they had the privilege to\r\nhear him. Every discourse was as complete as though it had been\r\ncarefully written and committed to memory; but evidently his was no\r\n_memoriter_ preaching. One sermon I particularly remember, delivered\r\nearly in March, 1826, from the words, 'If this counsel or this work be\r\nof men it will come to nought, but if it be of God ye cannot overthrow\r\nit; lest haply ye be found fighting against God.' (Acts v. 38, 39.) No\r\ndiscourse I had ever heard in my whole life before surpassed this in\r\neloquence and weight of sentiment; none even from Dr. Tyler was more\r\nmagnetic, more persuasive to right action on the part of an already\r\nawakened conscience, or put the soul more directly in an attitude in\r\nwhich it would be naturally drawn towards what is true and best. My\r\nrecollection of the feeling of the students toward him is, that he\r\nwas, on the whole, not inferior in popularity with them to any other\r\nmember of the Faculty. There is no man I could name so absolutely\r\nfaultless, as he seemed to us young men of that period. I am not sure\r\nthat his prestige and charm were not increased by the faultlessness of\r\nhis dress, and by the manifestations of the becoming in personal\r\nappearance,--a well-known trait of his great kinsman, Daniel Webster,\r\nwhom he not distantly resembled also in features, port, and step, and\r\nin distinct, measured utterance. Not that he in the least consciously\r\nimitated him, but there was the natural growth into the likeness of\r\nthe object of his admiration; and there was, as in Mr. Webster,\r\nabsolutely no affectation, nor sign of overmuch thought about raiment,\r\nnor vestige of anything like conscious, personal display.\"\r\n\r\nA later pupil says:\r\n\r\n\"As a teacher Professor Haddock was remarkable for his dignity and\r\nrefinement. His presence among young men was always sufficient to\r\nmaintain perfect order and decorum. The true gentleman beamed forth\r\nfrom every feature and spoke in every tone of his voice. With apparent\r\nease, he chained the attention of the most thoughtless to the most\r\nabstruse and uninviting topics. The deep things of Logic and\r\nPsychology he handled so adroitly, and presented so tastefully, as to\r\ngive them a charm, indeed, a fascination.\r\n\r\n\"In the recitation room his words were few, but his statements were so\r\nclear and so elegantly expressed, that what the student had been able\r\nto learn only partially or obscurely from the book was now fully\r\ncomprehended and securely treasured by the memory. The students were\r\nnever willingly absent, for it was always a delight to listen to his\r\ninstructions, and a failure to be present was counted an irreparable\r\nloss, inasmuch as the teacher always seemed greater than the\r\ntext-book.\r\n\r\n\"It is hardly necessary to say that the influence of such a man was an\r\nimportant factor in the last two years of our college life. His noble\r\nbearing, his handsome face, his impressive manner, his uniform\r\nkindness and courtesy, and, especially, his manifest appreciation of\r\nyoung men who were struggling against heavy obstacles in their course\r\nof study, will never be forgotten by those who were so fortunate as to\r\nbe under his tuition. Nor can it be doubted that the power of his\r\nrefined intellect and taste has been felt in many places where his\r\nname has never been heard.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Haddock married, first, Susan Saunders, daughter of Richard\r\nLang, of Hanover; second, Mrs. Caroline (Kimball) Young, daughter of\r\nRichard Kimball, of Lebanon, N. H. He died at West Lebanon, N. H.,\r\nJanuary 15, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR WILLIAM CHAMBERLAIN.--PROFESSOR DANIEL OLIVER.--PROFESSOR\r\nJAMES FREEMAN DANA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Chamberlain, the successor of Professor Moore in the chair of\r\nLanguages, was the son of General William and Jane (Eastman)\r\nChamberlain, and was born at Peacham, Vt., May 24, 1797. From a\r\nreliable source we have the following account of him:\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is on record no more worthy and comprehensive testimony\r\nto his character and his work than the few lines which the late\r\nPresident Lord furnished for the inscription on his tombstone. They\r\nread:\r\n\r\n\"William Chamberlain, Jr., A. M., Professor of Languages in Dartmouth\r\nCollege. A man of strong intellect, distinguished literary\r\nattainments, and moral worth.\r\n\r\n\"He added respectability to the institution, by prudence, efficiency,\r\nand a well-earned reputation; and contributed largely to promote its\r\ninterests. By disinterested and unwearied labors, with fidelity in all\r\nhis relations, beloved and honored, he filled up the measure of a\r\nshort but useful life, and died with humble confidence in the Divine\r\nmercy, through the atonement of Jesus Christ, July 11, 1830, aged 33.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave to the college for ten years the unremitting labor of his\r\nlife, and we may say his life itself. To his abundant and complete\r\nwork as a teacher he added the labor of overseeing the material\r\naffairs of the college,--a labor devolved upon him, perhaps, on\r\naccount of his superior executive ability.\r\n\r\nThus he superintended the building of Thornton and Wentworth Halls,\r\nand employed his vacations, and particularly the long winter\r\nvacation, in travelling over what was then the wilderness of northern\r\nNew Hampshire and Vermont, in care of the wild lands belonging to the\r\ncollege. Stricken with pneumonia on one of these journeys,--he would\r\nnot wait for a complete convalescence before returning to duty,--his\r\nmalady assumed the chronic form, and terminated his life in about six\r\nmonths after its first invasion.\r\n\r\nThe influences of his early life were such as may well have conduced\r\nto a broad and strong character.\r\n\r\nHis mother belonged to a family long identified with the early history\r\nof southern New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nHis father, General William Chamberlain, after serving in the armies\r\nof the Revolution, became a pioneer settler of northern Vermont, where\r\nhe acquired a handsome estate and a prominent public position. He\r\nbecame Lieutenant Governor of the State, and represented it in\r\nCongress for several terms. Among his public services may be mentioned\r\nhis care for the Caledonia County Grammar School, where his sons were\r\nfitted for college. This school was at that time taught by Ezra\r\nCarter, a man greatly respected for his attainments and dignity of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThus the future professor grew up amid the versatile life of the\r\nfrontier, surrounded by the contests and traditions of public service.\r\n\r\nDistinguished for scholarship in college, a bold but prudent leader\r\namong his classmates in their conflicts with the University,[43]\r\nimmediately after graduation he became the preceptor of Moors Charity\r\nSchool, and a year later entered, as a student of law, the office of\r\nDaniel Webster in Boston. Thence, in his twenty-fourth year he was\r\nrecalled to the college as professor of Languages, and in the ordinary\r\nand extraordinary service of the institution he was intensely occupied\r\nfor the remainder of his short life.\r\n\r\n      [43] The Rev. Daniel Lancaster, of the Class of 1821, supplies the\r\n           following recollections of the assault upon the college\r\n           libraries, made by a band of towns-people, under the guidance\r\n           of Professors Carter and Dean of the University. They had\r\n           forced the doors only to find that the books had already been\r\n           removed, and themselves thus inclosed, the prisoners of the\r\n           college students, led, among others, by senior Chamberlain.\r\n           Mr. Lancaster continues: \"Having stationed three or four of\r\n           his classmates at the door of the library to prevent ingress\r\n           or egress, he ascended a few steps on the flight of steps\r\n           leading to the next floor, and called the excited throng to\r\n           order. He then spoke in substance as follows: 'Fellow\r\n           students, we are in the midst of a desperate emergency. The\r\n           door of our library has been demolished. The vandals have\r\n           entered and taken possession, but we have met the enemy. They\r\n           are our prisoners and the library is safe. I have come from\r\n           the president, who wishes me to say to you that he is\r\n           confident you will conduct yourselves as gentlemen--using no\r\n           violence or insult--in all the arrangements to be adopted,\r\n           until order and quiet are restored.'\r\n\r\n           \"He then proceeded to marshal them in two files, beginning at\r\n           the door of the library, and extending down stairs to the\r\n           lower floor, through which files the University professors\r\n           were conducted, each under escort of three students, to\r\n           their homes.\"\r\n\r\n           General H. K. Oliver, of Massachusetts, a member of the then\r\n           Senior class, gives substantially the same account. He adds:\r\n\r\n           \"Having released the roughs on condition of good behavior,\r\n           we exacted a promise of the learned professors of Mathematics\r\n           and Dead Languages, 'that they would do so no more.'\r\n           Classmates Fox, Shirley, and I then escorted Professor Carter\r\n           home. Dean was escorted by Crosby (Hon. Nathan Crosby) and\r\n           others. He (Carter) was very polite to us, invited us in, and\r\n           treated us with wine and cake.\"\r\n\r\nA life so brief and active leaves behind it little but its example.\r\nYet I shall venture to extract a few paragraphs from an address\r\ndelivered by him on the 4th of July, 1826, the end of the first half\r\ncentury of our national life.\r\n\r\nRemembering that they were written at a period before the great\r\nproblems which have since controlled our history were recognized or\r\nappreciated among the people at large, they will be found to indicate\r\na moral tone and a political prescience quite remarkable in a young\r\nman of twenty-eight years.\r\n\r\n... \"I have already alluded to it as the first of the appropriate\r\nduties of this day, to turn to Heaven in the exercise of devout\r\ngratitude, and render thanksgiving and praise to Him who was the God\r\nof our fathers in the day of their trial; who gave to them and has\r\ncontinued to us a fairer portion than was ever allotted to any other\r\npeople. Is there one in this consecrated temple of the Almighty who\r\nwould not join in the offering? I know it is unusual to dwell long\r\nupon such considerations at a time like this, but surely, if there\r\never were a call for a nation's gratitude to God, and ever a proper\r\noccasion for expressing it, we are the people in whose hearts that\r\nemotion should be deep and permanent, and this is a time to give it\r\nutterance.\"...\r\n\r\n\"We must do all in our power to promote liberal feelings among the\r\nseveral communities and sections of our federal republic, so as to\r\npreserve inviolate the Union of the States. Were this Union now in\r\ndanger, it would call forth a more authoritative voice than mine; yet\r\nit may be in danger before the close of another half century. I will\r\nonly speak my own conviction, that the States cannot be separated\r\nwithout the destruction of the country. They lie together on the bosom\r\nof this vast continent, a protection and an ornament, each to the\r\nother, and all to each, like the gems on the breast-plate of the\r\nJewish Hierarch, indicative of the union of the Tribes, mutually\r\nlending and receiving lustre.\"...\r\n\r\n\"We must root out from among ourselves the institution of domestic\r\nslavery, or, before the close of another half century, we may have to\r\nabide the consequences of a servile war. In effecting this\r\nall-important object, we must indeed proceed gradually, temperately,\r\nin the observance of all good faith and good feeling toward the people\r\nof that portion of our Union on which the curse was entailed by the\r\ncolonial policy of the mother country.\r\n\r\n\"It is a work which demands the full concurrence of all the States,\r\nand, sooner or later, it must be accomplished. Common sense will not\r\ncease to upbraid us with inconsistency, humanity will not be\r\nsatisfied, nor Heaven fully propitiated, while we hold up boastfully\r\nin one hand this declaration, affirming that \"all men are created\r\nequal,\" and grasp with the other the manacles and the scourge.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may have been inferred by reason from a difference of\r\nphysical attributes, and whatever may have been forced by criticism\r\nout of the word of God, the traffic in human flesh is _contraband_ by\r\nthe law of Nature written in our hearts, and _forbidden_ by the whole\r\ntenor and spirit of the religion revealed in the Gospel.\r\n\r\n\"Even in the darker and imperfect dispensation of the ancient Jews,\r\nevery fiftieth year, at least, brought freedom to _all_ the\r\ninhabitants of the land. It is almost needless to say, that, if he who\r\nfirst procured the slave and brought him hither had no right to do so,\r\nthen neither could he who bought him acquire a rightful ownership.\r\nThere is no _property_ to a private man in the life or the natural\r\nfaculties of another; no right can accrue by purchase, or vest by\r\npossession, and no inheritance on either side descend. A title, which\r\nby its very nature was void from the beginning, can never be made\r\ngood; a dominion which Heaven never gave, must be perpetuated, if at\r\nall, by means which it will never sanction.\"...\r\n\r\nSurely, the trumpet of this youth gave no \"uncertain sound.\"\r\n\r\n    \"One blast upon that bugle horn.\r\n    Were worth ten thousand men.\"\r\n\r\nTo the recognition of such qualities it was due, probably, that in\r\n1829 he was called to New York city to assume the editorship of a\r\njournal (\"Journal of Commerce\") founded by an association of\r\ngentlemen, and which afterwards exerted great influence upon public\r\nopinion. He declined the offer, unwilling to leave his Alma Mater at a\r\ncritical epoch in her history. He stayed by her to die in her service.\r\n\r\nHis widow, Mrs. Sarah L. (Gilman) Chamberlain, daughter of Dr. Joseph\r\nGilman, of Wells, Me., and niece of Mrs. President Brown, survived him\r\ntwenty years, residing at Hanover. The memory of her moral,\r\nintellectual, and social worth is warmly cherished by all who knew\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMr. Lancaster adds: \"Professor Chamberlain was tall, erect, square\r\nbuilt, well-proportioned, and of graceful mien and bearing,--such a\r\nman as the eye could rest upon with pleasure. His voice was clear,\r\nsonorous, yet smooth and agreeable.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Folsom says:\r\n\r\n\"Professor Chamberlain, the youngest member of the Faculty, who was\r\nonly twenty-three years old when, in 1820, he entered on his\r\nprofessorship of the Latin and Greek Languages and Literature, and\r\nonly thirty-three when he died, was much admired and loved and\r\nreverenced by many of us. To myself, whenever I think of Dartmouth,\r\nhis image invariably appears, and he stands out among the objects\r\npresenting themselves second only to that of Dr. Tyler, as the latter\r\nappeared when at his best and noblest in the pulpit. It was indeed in\r\nthat same pulpit, and before I came under his instruction, that I\r\nfirst heard him, when he delivered an oration on the Fourth of July\r\nin the year 1826. It was to a crowded audience, filling the floor and\r\nthe galleries. I doubt whether there is one survivor of that number,\r\nwhether student or townsman, from whose recollection can have faded\r\naway the image of the orator, his form and attitude, his voice and\r\naction, and some of his thrilling words, especially when he described\r\nthe nation holding in one hand the Declaration of Independence which\r\nproclaims human equality, and with the other grasping the manacles and\r\nscourge to torture millions of human beings bought and sold, and\r\ncompelled to labor in slavery.\r\n\r\nProfessor Chamberlain took charge of the Class of 1828 in Latin and\r\nGreek when they entered on their Junior year. As soon as our class met\r\nhim in the east recitation-room--he being seated at a small table on\r\nhis left, and the class in lines of a half-parallelogram extending on\r\nthe right and in front of him--we felt that we had come under a noble\r\nteacher. Some of us who loved the languages that he taught, and also\r\nhad become acquainted with the best of the upper classes, carried with\r\nus none other than very high anticipations of a most profitable and\r\npleasant term of study. And so it proved. How he used to electrify us\r\nat times by repeating something that had just been recited, as at the\r\nclose of the Agricola of Tacitus, his strongly marked face all lighted\r\nup, new significance and something like inspiration being given us,\r\nwhen with his deliberate, distinct, emphatic, rhythmical, rich\r\nutterance, flowed out that prophetic sentence in the world's\r\nliterature, 'Quidquid ex Agricola amavimus, quidquid mirati sumus,\r\nmanet mansurumque in animis hominum, in aeternitate temporum, in fama\r\nrerum!'\r\n\r\n\"I remember that while my class were in the Oedipus Tyrannus of\r\nSophocles and the Medea of Euripides, I was suffering from weak eyes,\r\nand went to the recitation-room with no other preparation than that of\r\nhearing each lesson twice read to me by two different students, who\r\ndid me the kindness to perform that service. But with Professor\r\nChamberlain's luminous explanation and comment, no Greek of my whole\r\ncollege course more deeply interested and helped me.\r\n\r\n\"He heard the rehearsal of my Commencement oration, and some of his\r\nwords on that occasion I have not ceased to remember with gratitude.\r\nNor was I the only one who received from him words of encouragement\r\nthat proved of most valuable service in our subsequent career. Still\r\nit was the _moral_ element that constituted his highest power of\r\ninfluencing young men, and was his distinguishing personality. May I\r\nsay, for one, that in this moral and spiritual personality he has\r\nagain and again come to me since his departure, and been a present\r\nhelper toward whatever of good I have attained in life.\r\n\r\n\"A single anecdote will serve to illustrate the _love_ with which his\r\npupils cherish his memory. I cannot but think that every survivor of\r\nmy class must have some recollection of the fact, and share all my\r\nfeelings in regard to it. He had been occasionally late at recitation,\r\nand the class, to give him a lesson of promptness, one morning having\r\nassembled as usual after service in chapel, and waited some four\r\nminutes past the hour, carried the vote to go to our rooms; and so,\r\nthe professor just turning the corner, and hastening up the slope, and\r\nhis approach being announced by some on the lookout, we dashed out,\r\nthrough the rear doors, or up the stairways, and not a solitary member\r\nof the class remained in the room. The next morning he was already\r\nthere when we reached the place, made no remark on the occurrence of\r\nthe previous day, and none of us could discern in him the faintest\r\ntrace of displeasure. When, two years after we graduated, I heard of\r\nhis death, I remembered a slight, hacking cough which he had, and that\r\nslightly bent, spare, though large and tall frame, and always placid\r\nface, and realized for the first time that what we imputed to him as a\r\nfault was the hindrance of disease, and possibly of sleepless nights;\r\nand I would have given a world for an opportunity to ask his\r\nforgiveness.\"[44]\r\n\r\n      [44] The writer did not know until a few years ago that he was\r\n           related, though somewhat distantly, to the wife of Professor\r\n           Chamberlain. He was personally acquainted with her from his\r\n           Sophomore year. He then boarded and roomed at Mrs. President\r\n           Brown's (Mrs. C.'s aunt). Her paternal great-grandfather,\r\n           Rev. Nicholas Gilman, of Durham, N. H., and the writer's\r\n           paternal great-grandfather (as well as maternal\r\n           great-great-grandfather), Dr. Josiah Gilman, of Exeter,\r\n           N. H., were brothers. He has felt, ever since he knew this\r\n           fact, like having a clearer right of inheritance in Professor\r\n           Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nAnother pupil says of Professor Chamberlain:\r\n\r\n\"He was well-proportioned, tall, active, and energetic. His expression\r\nwas dignified and commanding. In his word there was power. Integrity\r\nmarked all his life. His word was as good as his bond. His principles\r\nwere firmly grasped and implicitly followed. His intellectual powers\r\nwere of a high order. He impressed every acquaintance with his\r\nintellectual greatness. His discourse was lofty but impressive.\r\n\r\n\"His religious life was less marked in public. He united with no\r\nchurch, though he was a man of prayer and from his dying bed sent a\r\nreligious message to the students.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom a reliable source we have the following notice of another of\r\nDartmouth's eminent and honored teachers:\r\n\r\nDaniel Oliver, whose name appears on the list of teachers of past\r\nyears in both the Medical and Academical departments of Dartmouth\r\nCollege, was born on the 9th of September, 1787. He was the third son\r\nof the Rev. Thomas Fitch Oliver, at that time rector of St. Michael's,\r\nMarblehead, and belonged to a family distinguished in the history of\r\nMassachusetts from the earliest period of the colony. He was a direct\r\ndescendant of Mr. Thomas Oliver, whom Winthrop calls \"an experienced\r\nand very skilful surgeon,\" and who acted as one of the ruling elders\r\nof the church in Boston soon after his arrival in 1632. Through his\r\nmother he was descended from William Pynchon, one of the founders of\r\nthe Massachusetts Colony, and the Rev. William Hubbard, the historian\r\nof New England; and, through his paternal grandmother he was a\r\ndescendant of the Rev. John Eliot, the noted Indian missionary.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of his father, which took place at Garrison Forest,\r\nnear Baltimore, before he had attained his tenth year, he was placed\r\nin the care of Colonel Lloyd Rogers, of that city, and almost\r\nimmediately commenced his preparatory course for college, applying\r\nhimself to his studies with great diligence, and entered. Harvard\r\nCollege in 1802. Although fond of study, and possessed of a mind of\r\nunusual vigor and brilliancy, the ambitions of college life do not\r\nseem to have dimmed the memories of his forest home in the South, and\r\nin his letters, while at Cambridge, he more than once recalls the\r\npleasant hours when living within its shades, in a strain at once\r\nsuggestive of a refined and poetic nature.\r\n\r\nTo one of his thoughtful and contemplative mind it is not strange\r\nthat, suddenly transferred from the quiet of home life to the turmoil\r\nof college scenes, he should have found much that was distasteful; and\r\nthe following extract from a letter to him from the late Mr. Justice\r\nStory, at that time betrothed to his eldest sister, and with whom he\r\nwas on terms of intimacy, would seem to imply no little disquietude on\r\nthe part of his student friend during the earlier years of his life at\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\n\"You can hardly imagine with what delight I recur to the days which I\r\nspent at Cambridge. In the delightful seclusion from noisy vulgarity,\r\nin the sweet interchange of kind sentiments, and in the mutual\r\ncompetition of classic pursuits, I possessed a unity and tranquillity\r\nof purpose far beyond the merits of my later years. My first years\r\nthere were not marked with this peculiar character. It was in my\r\nJunior and Senior years that, from forming a choice of friends, and\r\nparticipating in the higher views of literature, I felt that happiness\r\nresulted in the activity of intellect and possession of friendship.\r\nThat period will in future be yours; and though you may start with\r\nsurprise at the thought at this moment, that period will be marked out\r\nin the calendar of your years as among the _dies fortunatos_. You and\r\nI are not widely distinct in years, and you can therefore readily\r\nbelieve that this attachment is not the moral relation of comparison\r\nand experience; no, it was reality which charmed me when present, and\r\nreflects a lustre in remembrance. Go on, then, my dear fellow, in the\r\nacademic course with awakened hope. A high destiny awaits you. The\r\njoys of youth shall give spirit to the exertions of manhood, and the\r\npursuits of literature yield a permanent felicity attainable only by\r\nthe votaries of taste. Sweet are the attainments which accomplish the\r\nwishes of friends. Our reliance upon you is founded on a belief that\r\nambition and literature will unite us in as close bonds as sympathy\r\nand affinity.\r\n\r\n\"On a subject so interesting to me as my collegiate course I seldom\r\nreflect without melancholy; not a harsh and dark brooding, but a soft\r\nand tender pensiveness which\r\n\r\n    \"'Sheds o'er the soul a sympathetic gloom.'\r\n\r\n\"The thousand associations of festivity, pleasantry, study, and\r\nrecreation live to hallow the whole. The picture, by its distance,\r\nloses its defects, and retains only the strong colorings of primitive\r\nimpression. Never do I cast my eyes on that dear seat of letters but I\r\nexclaim involuntarily with Gray:\r\n\r\n    \"'Ah! happy fields, ah! pleasing shade,\r\n        Ah! groves beloved in vain,\r\n    Where once my careless childhood strayed,\r\n        A stranger yet to pain;\r\n    I feel the gales that round ye blow\r\n        A momentary bliss bestow.'\r\n\r\n\"By the way, when you are at leisure and feel a little dull, I advise\r\nyou to take up some of our good-natured writers, such as Dr. Moore,\r\nGoldsmith, Coleman, Cervantes, Don Quixote, Smollett's novels, or the\r\npleasant and airy productions of the muse. These I have always found a\r\npowerful anti-splenetic; and, although I am not a professed physician,\r\nI will venture to prescribe to you in this instance with all the\r\nconfidence of Hippocrates. The whole system of nostrums from that\r\narch-quack, the old serpent, down to the far-famed Stoughton of our\r\nown day, does not present so powerful a remedy, amid all its _antis_,\r\nas cheerful reading to a heavy spirit. I will venture to say, in the\r\nspirit of Montesquieu, that an hour of such reading will place one\r\nquietly in his elbow chair in all the tranquillity of a Platonic\r\nlover.\"\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Mr. Story's influence was not without its effect\r\nin reconciling his young friend to college life, for he was very soon\r\nto be found among the foremost in the race for honorable distinction.\r\nHe was graduated with distinguished honor, in 1806, in a class of\r\nremarkable ability, among whom were the late Hon. Alexander Everett,\r\nJudge William P. Preble, Professor J. G. Cogswell, and the venerable\r\nDr. Jacob Bigelow, its last surviving member.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving college he began the study of law under the direction of\r\nMr. Story, but very soon abandoned it, and entered the office of his\r\nuncle, the late Dr. B. Lynde Oliver, of Salem, as a student of\r\nmedicine. In 1809, he entered the University of Pennsylvania, at that\r\ntime distinguished by the names of Rush, Wistar, and Physick, and by\r\nhis talents and attainments soon attracted the notice of Dr. Rush,\r\nwhose favorite pupil and warm friend he afterwards became. On\r\nreceiving his medical degree, the following letter, written in terms\r\nof the highest compliment, was addressed by Dr. Rush to his uncle and\r\nformer instructor.\r\n\r\n    \"Philadelphia, May 1, 1810.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir: I sit down with great pleasure to answer your letter by\r\nyour nephew, now Dr. Oliver, and to inform you at the same time that\r\nhe has received the honor of a doctor's degree in our university much\r\nto his credit and the satisfaction of his teachers. From his singular\r\ntalents, and from his acquirements and manners, he cannot fail of\r\nbecoming eminent in his profession. Long, very long, may he live to\r\nreflect honor upon all who are related to him, or who have been\r\ninstrumental in opening and directing his acute and capacious mind in\r\nthe prosecution of his studies! Be assured he carries with him my\r\nhighest respect and sincere affection.\r\n\r\n\"With respectful compliments to the venerable patriarch of medicine,\r\nDr. Holyoke (if not translated to a better world),\r\n\r\n    \"I am, dear sir, very sincerely yours,\r\n    \"Benjamin Rush.\r\n    \"Dr. B. Lynde Oliver.\"\r\n\r\nOn his return to Salem, Dr. Oliver commenced the practice of medicine,\r\nand in July, 1811, as appears from his diary, he connected himself\r\nwith Dr. R. D. Mussey, then a rising young surgeon, and with whom he\r\nwas afterwards so long associated. From the following entry in the\r\ndiary referred to, under date of July 12, 1812, may be learned\r\nsomewhat of his tastes at this time, and his mode of passing the\r\nwaiting hours of an early professional life:\r\n\r\n\"This day completed the first year of my connection in the medical\r\nprofession with Dr. R. D. Massey. On reviewing this period, I am\r\nsensible of a great loss of time, and of a degree of professional and\r\nliterary improvement altogether inadequate to such an extent of time.\r\nSome improvement, however, has I hope, been made. With respect to the\r\nbooks which I have read during the past year, the most important are\r\nMosheim's 'Ecclesiastical History,' which I have not yet quite\r\ncompleted,--a learned and judicious outline of the history of the\r\nchurch, embracing many collateral topics of learning and\r\nphilosophy ...; Homer's 'Iliad' in Greek, with the exception of\r\nthe last book; the 'Æneid' except the last two; two or three books\r\nof Livy, and several of Juvenal's 'Satires.'\r\n\r\n\"The most important literary enterprise which I have undertaken and\r\naccomplished has been the delivery of a course of lectures on\r\nChemistry in connection with Dr. Mussey. In Anatomy, also, we have\r\nexecuted something. Medicine will, in future, claim more of my\r\nattention, but not to the neglect of the two important collateral\r\nbranches above mentioned.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1815, Dr. Oliver was appointed to deliver a course of\r\nchemical lectures before the medical class at Dartmouth College.\r\nAlthough he had thus far pursued the study of chemistry as a\r\ncollateral branch of medical science, he felt warranted in accepting\r\nthe appointment, without, however, proposing to himself a more\r\npermanent position in this department.\r\n\r\nIn 1817, he was married to Miss Mary Robinson Pulling, the only\r\ndaughter of Edward Pulling, Esq., an eminent barrister of Salem, and\r\nalmost immediately went again to Philadelphia to avail himself of the\r\nadvantages of that seat of medical learning, returning to Salem in the\r\nspring of 1818.\r\n\r\nIn the following year he was induced to undertake, in connection with\r\nthe Hon. John Pickering, the preparation of a Greek lexicon, a work\r\ninvolving much labor and research, and the larger portion of which\r\nfell to his lot. Although mainly based on the Latin of Schrevelius,\r\nmany of the interpretations were new, and there were added more than\r\ntwo thousand new articles. The magnitude of the task and its\r\nsuccessful accomplishment at once raised him to a conspicuous rank\r\namong the scholars of his day.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1820 he accepted an appointment to the professorship\r\nof the Theory and Practice of Medicine, and of Materia Medica and\r\nTherapeutics in Dartmouth College, where he delivered his first course\r\nof lectures in the following autumn. He was also made Professor of\r\nBotany, and his lectures upon Physiology were among his most valuable\r\ncontributions to medical literature. He took up his permanent\r\nresidence in Hanover, in August, 1821, and from this time to the close\r\nof his connection with the college he was most faithful to all its\r\ninterests. In 1825 he was appointed to the chair of Intellectual\r\nPhilosophy in the Academical department of the college, a position\r\nwhich he filled with the ability that distinguished him elsewhere. The\r\naddress delivered by him on the occasion of his induction into this\r\nprofessorship, upon the \"Comparative Importance of the Study of Mental\r\nScience,\" was thus far, perhaps, his most successful literary effort.\r\nClear, comprehensive, and abounding in passages of remarkable beauty\r\nand force, it established the reputation of its author both as a\r\nwriter and a metaphysician.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 was published his \"First Lines in Physiology,\" a treatise\r\nwhich received the highest commendation both at home and abroad. It\r\npassed through three editions, and although the rapid advance in\r\nphysiological science since its publication has long since led to its\r\ndisuse, it will still be admired by medical scholars for the purity of\r\nits style and the learning it everywhere displays.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1837, Dr. Oliver closed his connection with the\r\ncollege, and returned to Cambridge, where he was temporarily residing\r\nat the time of his appointment, again to resume the practice of his\r\nprofession. He, however, delivered a course of lectures at the\r\nDartmouth Medical School in the autumn of this and the following year.\r\nHe was also induced, in 1840, after declining professorships both in\r\nSt. Mary's College, Baltimore, and in Pennsylvania University, to\r\ndeliver a course of lectures on Materia Medica at the Medical College\r\nof Ohio, but he resigned the chair at the close of the session, and\r\nreturned again to Cambridge, where he resided to the close of his\r\nlife. Although in declining health at this time, he did not relinquish\r\nprofessional practice until within a few months of his death, which\r\ntook place on the 1st of June, 1842.\r\n\r\nDuring his comparatively brief career, Dr. Oliver had become widely\r\nknown as a medical and general scholar. As a teacher in the various\r\ndepartments of medical science with which he was connected he was also\r\neminently successful. His lectures, always prepared with great care,\r\nwere written with remarkable clearness and elegance, and were often\r\nlistened to with attention by many outside the ranks of the\r\nprofession. \"His lectures to the under-graduates of the college,\" says\r\na contemporary,[45] \"would be thought, I am persuaded, still more\r\nremarkable than those upon Physiology. They were intended to exhibit\r\nthe present state of mental philosophy. And the singular clearness\r\nwith which he discriminated the settled points of absolute knowledge\r\nin this comprehensive and yet imperfect science, his happy development\r\nof intricate and complicated principles, and the beautiful colors\r\nwhich a true poetic spirit enabled him now and then to throw over the\r\nbald peaks and angles of this cold region, entitle him to a rank among\r\nmetaphysicians as eminent as he maintained in his appropriate\r\nprofession.\"\r\n\r\n      [45] Eulogy on Daniel Oliver, delivered by Rev. C. B. Haddock,\r\n           professor of Belles Lettres.\r\n\r\n\"The intellectual character of Dr. Oliver,\" the same writer afterwards\r\nadds, in language admirably chosen, \"came nearer than it has been my\r\nfortune to observe in almost any other instance to the idea of a\r\nperfect scholar. He was at once profound, comprehensive, and elegant.\r\nUpon no subject which he had considered was his knowledge fragmentary\r\nor partial. A philosophic, systematic habit of mind led him always to\r\nseek for the principles of things, and to be satisfied only with the\r\ntruth. The compass of his inquiries was as extraordinary as their\r\ndepth. He had investigated with care a surprising extent of knowledge.\r\nA master of his own language, and minutely acquainted with all its\r\nprincipal productions, he was also thoroughly versed in the Greek, and\r\nfamiliar with the original works which have given to that tongue the\r\nfirst place among human dialects. The German he read with facility,\r\nand had pursued his favorite studies in the masters of its profound\r\nlearning. Of French and Italian he was not ignorant. Music, both as a\r\nscience and an art, was his delight and recreation. In the arts of\r\npainting and sculpture his information was liberal and his taste said\r\nto be excellent. Morals and politics he had studied in their theory,\r\nand in the history of the world. His acquaintance with civil history\r\nwas among the most extraordinary of his attainments. The beautiful in\r\nNature, in life, or in art or literature, few men have so exquisitely\r\nenjoyed or so justly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, the principal elements of a perfect mind seem to have been\r\nsingularly united and harmonized in him,--exactness of knowledge,\r\nliberal learning, and true taste.\"\r\n\r\nBred from infancy in the Church of England, Dr. Oliver continued to\r\nthe end a faithful member of that communion, and few persons have had\r\na firmer faith in the sublime truths of revealed religion. It was no\r\nless to his deeply religious and truthful spirit than to his innate\r\nlove of right that may be ascribed that regard for things sacred, that\r\nsingular modesty, that unfailing courtesy, and the high sense of\r\npersonal honor that distinguished him. It had been his desire, at a\r\nlate period of his life, to become a candidate for Holy Orders, a step\r\nfor which his ripe theological scholarship and his critical knowledge\r\nof Greek and Hebrew had already prepared him, but his age deterred\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nDr. Oliver had published little. Besides the treatise on Physiology\r\nalready mentioned, there are a few pamphlets containing addresses\r\ndelivered on various occasions, the most important of which are one\r\nbefore the New Hampshire Historical Society in 1836, and that before\r\nthe college at the time of his induction into the professorship of\r\nMoral and Intellectual Philosophy.\r\n\r\nAmong his medical manuscripts may be mentioned an unfinished work on\r\nGeneral Pathology, which, had he lived to complete, would have added\r\nto his reputation as a medical author. Among his papers were also a\r\nfew unpublished addresses and a few short and fragmentary poems, the\r\neffusions of his earlier years, all characterized by that elegance of\r\nstyle and fine poetic taste and feeling that marked their author.\r\n\r\nA member of many learned literary and medical societies at home, Dr.\r\nOliver was honored in 1835 with a diploma from the Academy of Sciences\r\nand Belles Lettres of Palermo, and in 1838 received the degree of\r\nDoctor of Laws.\r\n\r\nThe following notice of a gentleman of rare eminence in the scientific\r\nworld, is from a reliable source:\r\n\r\nJames Freeman Dana, who was connected as a teacher with both the\r\nAcademical and Medical departments of Dartmouth College, was born at\r\nAmherst, N. H., September 23, 1793. He was the eldest son of Luther\r\nand Lucy (Giddings) Dana, and grandson of Rev. and Hon. Samuel Dana.\r\nOn the father's side he was descended from Richard Dana, who was among\r\nthe early settlers in Massachusetts; on that of his mother he was a\r\ndescendant in the seventh generation from Rev. John Robinson, the\r\npastor of the noble band of Pilgrims who founded Plymouth, Mass.\r\n\r\nDana was fitted for college at Phillips Academy, Exeter, N. H.,\r\nentered Harvard in 1809, and graduated in 1813, his name standing on\r\nthe catalogue as Jonathan Freeman Dana; the first name, by which,\r\nhowever, he had never been known, was changed to James, by act of\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nImmediately after entering Harvard, Dana showed a decided partiality\r\nfor scientific pursuits. To Natural Philosophy, Natural History, and\r\nChemistry, he mainly devoted his attention, making excursions into the\r\nsurrounding country for the purpose of examining its geological\r\nstructure, and collecting mineralogical and other specimens. The\r\nresult of these rambles was embodied in a small volume, published in\r\nconjunction with his brother Dr. S. L. Dana, in 1819, entitled\r\n\"Mineralogy and Geology of Boston and its Environs.\" While in college\r\nhe formed, together with his brother and several classmates, a society\r\nfor the cultivation of Natural Science and Philosophy, named at first\r\nfor two distinguished French chemists, but afterward known as the\r\nHermetic Society. Towards the close of his collegiate course he was\r\nappointed to assist Dr. Gorham, the professor of Chemistry, in\r\npreparing his experiments. That eminent physician and chemist soon\r\nbecame so much interested in the pupil who displayed such assiduity in\r\nscientific researches, that finding he intended to pursue the study of\r\nmedicine, he kindly invited him to do so under his tuition.\r\n\r\nIn 1813, Mr. Dana commenced his studies with Dr. Gorham, attending\r\nlectures at the Medical College, but though he became well acquainted\r\nwith the principles and practice of the profession, he never\r\nrelinquished his preference for Chemistry and Mineralogy. He became an\r\nactive member of the Boston Linnæan Society, and the first paper read\r\nbefore it, entitled \"An Analysis of the Incrustation formed upon the\r\nBasket of Eggs from Derbyshire, England\" (presented by Judge Davis),\r\nwas read by him. In the spring of 1813, the Corporation of Harvard\r\nCollege employed Mr. Dana to visit England in order to procure\r\nsuitable apparatus for its chemical department. During his stay abroad\r\nhe studied, for a time, under the instruction of the somewhat\r\ndistinguished Frederic Accum. In consequence of this absence he did\r\nnot receive his degree of M.D. till 1817, that of A. M. having been\r\npreviously conferred.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1817, Dr. Dana was appointed to deliver a course of\r\nchemical lectures to the medical students of Dartmouth College. The\r\nprofessors in the Medical School were Dr. R. D. Mussey and Dr. Cyrus\r\nPerkins. These lectures were so satisfactory that the appointment was\r\ncontinued, and during the autumns of 1818, 1819, and 1820, he lectured\r\nat Dartmouth, residing during the intervals at Cambridge, where, in\r\nJanuary, 1818, he was united in marriage with Matilda, third daughter\r\nof Samuel Webber, D.D., late president of Harvard College.\r\n\r\nIn 1821, being appointed professor at Dartmouth, Dr. Dana removed to\r\nHanover, where, relinquishing the practice of medicine, he devoted his\r\nwhole attention to his favorite studies, to which was now added\r\nBotany, upon which he delivered some courses of lectures.\r\n\r\nDr. Perkins, the Professor of Materia Medica, removed to New York\r\nafter the dissolution of the \"University of New Hampshire,\" and the\r\nlate admired and lamented Dr. Daniel Oliver, of Salem, was appointed\r\nto the professorship. Dr. Mussey, celebrated for his surgical\r\nknowledge and skill, remained as the head of the Medical School, and\r\namong these gentlemen, differing widely as they did in many\r\ncharacteristics, the warmest friendship subsisted. During the\r\nintervals of leisure from strictly professional duties, Dr. Dana\r\noccupied himself in continuing to write for \"Silliman's Journal,\" and\r\nin frequent excursions to various parts of New Hampshire, for the\r\npurpose of analyzing the ores and waters of mines and springs. His\r\npublished analysis of the waters of a spring in Burton, N. H., was\r\nconsidered so scientific a production, that he was written to as to\r\naccepting a professorship in the University of Virginia. Not wishing\r\nthe appointment, he declined becoming a candidate.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1825, Professor Dana published \"An Epitome of\r\nChemical Philosophy,\" designed as a text-book for his own classes, but\r\nwhich was afterwards adopted as such in two other institutions. In\r\n1826, he was appointed one of the visitors of West Point Military\r\nAcademy, and soon after his return was chosen to the chair of\r\nChemistry, in the College of Physicians and Surgeons in the University\r\nof New York, to which city he then removed. He was elected member of\r\nthe Linnæan Society of New York, and accepted an invitation to deliver\r\na course of lectures before the Athenæeum.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence at Hanover, Professor Dana had been much\r\ninterested in Electro-magnetism, then a new science, and in preparing\r\napparatus for exhibiting its wonders, freely stating his conviction\r\nthat it would produce more astonishing results than any power\r\npreviously known. When surprise was expressed at his selecting for his\r\nAthenæeum lectures this subject, so little known even in Europe, and\r\nin which so few in this country would feel any interest, Dr. Dana\r\nreplied that he had chosen it for those reasons; that he thought it\r\ntime for public attention to be directed to it, as he was certain it\r\nwould lead to most valuable results, and that he should endeavor to\r\nrender it popular. How far he succeeded, the delighted audiences that\r\ncrowded to hear him bore evidence. Of the truth of his prediction as\r\nto the results to be wrought out by the science, the marvels of the\r\nelectro-magnetic telegraph bear witness to the world.\r\n\r\nSamuel F. B. Morse was then following his profession as a painter in\r\nNew York, and lectured upon art before the Athenæeum. An intimacy\r\nsprang up between him and Dr. Dana, whose lectures he attended, and\r\nwhom he used to visit in his laboratory, thus becoming familiar with\r\nhis views on scientific subjects. Morse's published statements as to\r\nthe origin of his knowledge of electro-magnetism are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I learned from Professor Dana, in 1827, the rationale of the\r\nelectro-magnet, which' latter was exhibited in action. I witnessed the\r\neffects of the conjunctive wires in the different forms described in\r\nhis lectures, and exhibited to his audience. The electro-magnet was\r\nput in action by an intensity battery; it was made to sustain the\r\nweight of its armature, when the conjunctive wire was connected with\r\nthe poles of the battery or the circuit was closed; and it was made to\r\n'drop its load' upon opening the circuit. These, with many other\r\nprinciples of electro-magnetism were all illustrated experimentally to\r\nhis audience. These being the facts, to whom do I owe the first\r\nknowledge which I obtained of the science of electro-magnetism bearing\r\nupon the practical development of the telegraph? Professor Dana had\r\npublicly demonstrated in my hearing and to my sight all the facts\r\nnecessary to be known respecting the electro-magnet.... The volute\r\nmodification of the helix to show the concentration of magnetism at\r\nits centre, adapted to the electric magnet, the modification since\r\nuniversally adopted in the construction of the electro-magnet, is\r\njustly due, I think, to the inventive mind of Prof. James Freeman\r\nDana. Death, in striking him down at the threshold of his fame, not\r\nonly extinguished a brilliant light in science--one which gave the\r\nhighest promise of future distinction--but the suddenness of the\r\nstroke put to peril the just credit due him for discoveries he had\r\nalready made. Dana had not only mastered all of the science of\r\nelectro-magnetism then given to the world, a science in which he was\r\nan enthusiast, but, standing on the confines that separate the known\r\nfrom the unknown, was at the time of his decease preparing for new\r\nexplorations and new discoveries. I could not mention his name in this\r\nconnection without at least rendering this slight but inadequate\r\nhomage to one of the most liberal of men and amiable of friends, as\r\nwell as promising philosophers of his age.\"\r\n\r\nThe delivery of these lectures was amongst Dr. Dana's last public\r\nefforts. A severe cold, resulting in an attack of erysipelas affecting\r\nthe brain, terminated his brief life of thirty-three years, on the\r\n15th of April, 1827.\r\n\r\nIn the various relations of private life he had won the warm\r\nattachment of all who knew him. To the charm of a buoyant and\r\naffectionate disposition he added Christian principle and character.\r\nDuring his student life at Harvard, he had become a communicant of the\r\nEpiscopal Church, and continued a devout worshipper according to her\r\nliturgy. Her Burial Service was read over his remains, by his friend\r\nDr. Wainwright, the funeral rites being performed at Grace Church, on\r\nthe 17th of April.\r\n\r\nWhen it was proposed, in 1871, by the National Telegraph Monument\r\nAssociation to erect a monument to Professor Morse, at Washington, the\r\nfamily of Dr. Dana furnished, at its request, a portrait of him from\r\nwhich a likeness was to be cast for one of the faces at the base of\r\nthe monument. Since the death of Professor Morse, no progress seems to\r\nhave been made in the effort to erect this memorial of scientific\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nPROF. BENJAMIN HALE.--PROF. ALPHEUS CROSBY.--PROF. IRA YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom reliable sources we have the following account of another\r\ngentleman of distinguished worth, who was an instructor also both in\r\nthe Academical and Medical departments of the college.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Hale was born on the 23d of November, 1797, in Newbury,\r\nMass., now a part of the city of Newburyport. He was the eldest son of\r\nThomas Hale, who was the grandson of the fifth Thomas, in that series\r\nof Hales, whose first representative came to Newbury in about 1637.\r\nHis mother was Alice Little, a daughter of the Hon. Josiah Little of\r\nNewbury, and grand-daughter of Col. Moses Little, an officer in the\r\nContinental Army. On both sides of the house Benjamin Hale came of a\r\nrace of vigorous, industrious, and useful men, held in honor by their\r\nfellow citizens, and invariably distinguished for their exemplary\r\nhabits, their domestic virtues, their sterling goodness, and their\r\nfaithfulness in the discharge of trusts and duties. In childhood he\r\nwas studious, quiet, kind, and genial; fond of books, the favorite of\r\nhis youthful companions, and the cheerful companion of the aged.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1813, he went to Atkinson Academy; and in September,\r\n1814, entered Dartmouth College; but his health becoming impaired, he\r\nwent to Dummer Academy, Byfield, in the autumn of 1815, to pursue his\r\nstudies under the direction of its principal, the Rev. Mr. Abbott. In\r\nFebruary, 1816, he entered the Sophomore class at Bowdoin College,\r\nthen under the presidency of the venerable Dr. Appleton, whose grave\r\nkindness soon won his reverent love. He at once secured an honorable\r\nposition in his class, which was the largest that had then been in\r\nthat college. In September, 1818, he received the degree of B. A.;\r\nhis part at Commencement being the salutatory oration. Having been\r\npreviously offered the academy at Saco, and recollecting a remark of\r\nhis old pastor, Dr. Spring, that \"one who meant to be a minister would\r\ndo well to try his hand at being a schoolmaster,\" he took charge of\r\nthe academy for one year.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1819, he became a member of the Theological Seminary\r\nat Andover, Mass. Here his college classmate, Rufus Anderson,\r\nafterwards the distinguished Secretary of the American Board of\r\nCommissioners for Foreign Missions, was his class-mate and room-mate.\r\nDr. Anderson thus writes of him: \"Our friendship was founded in mutual\r\nknowledge and esteem, and continued during his life. The operations of\r\nhis mind were effective, equally so in nearly every branch of\r\nlearning. He was quick and accurate in the Mathematics, in the\r\nLanguages, and in Music. I know not in what one branch he was best\r\nfitted to excel. While perfect in all his recitations, he was social,\r\nalways ready for conversation when I desired it. He had, and through\r\nhis whole life retained, my entire confidence as a man of God, nor was\r\nI surprised at the eminent position he afterwards attained in the\r\nchurch of Christ. Pleasant is his memory, and pleasant is the thought\r\nof meeting him in a better world.\" While at Andover he had leisure for\r\nreading, and that part of it which he devoted to Ecclesiastical\r\nHistory had an important influence as it turned out, in deciding his\r\nfuture ecclesiastical connection.\r\n\r\nAt the Commencement of Bowdoin College, in 1820, he was appointed\r\ntutor. He taught the Junior class in Natural Philosophy, and Locke's\r\nEssay on the Human Understanding, and the Sophomore class in Geometry\r\nand some other parts of Mathematics, and in Logic. At the same time he\r\ncontinued to pursue his theological studies, and in January, 1822, was\r\nlicensed to preach by the York Association. In September, 1821, he\r\ndelivered a Latin valedictory oration, and took his degree of A. M.\r\nWith regard to this period of his life, his fellow tutor, now the\r\nvenerable Prof. Packard, thus writes: \"Mr. Hale gave at once the\r\nimpression of a kind, generous, faithful heart, a clear, acute, and\r\nrapid intellect, and a vigorous grasp of any subject to which he gave\r\nhis thought. He was a diligent student. He loved books. Without\r\nconceit he had sufficient self-reliance, which was always of service\r\nto him as a teacher and governor. He always had the good-will of his\r\npupils, and whether with them or with his colleagues he exerted an\r\ninfluence above rather than below his age and standing. He was a true\r\nman, unselfish, of a decidedly social turn, of warm affections, of a\r\ngenial humor.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1822, he received proposals from R. H. Gardiner,\r\nEsq., of Gardiner, Me., to take charge of a new institution which he\r\nhad determined to establish for the education of farmers and mechanics\r\nin the principles of science. Mr. Hale accepted, and closed his\r\nconnection with Bowdoin College in 1822, and entering upon his duties\r\nJanuary 1, 1823, opened the Lyceum, was inaugurated as its principal,\r\nand delivered an address on the occasion. He soon after returned his\r\nlicense, finding it inconvenient to meet the many calls for preaching\r\nextended to him, and having become also so settled in his preference\r\nfor the Protestant Episcopal Church that he determined to take Orders\r\ntherein, should he ever be so situated as to think it his duty to\r\npreach again. On the 9th day of April, 1823, he was married to Mary\r\nCaroline King, the eldest daughter of the Hon. Cyrus King, M. C.\r\n\r\nThe Lyceum soon attracted students and became a flourishing\r\ninstitution. Its principal gave lectures in Chemistry and taught\r\nMathematics and Natural Philosophy, and in winter had classes in\r\nArchitecture and in Agricultural Chemistry. For the former of these\r\nclasses he prepared, in 1827, a work on the \"Elementary Principles of\r\nCarpentry.\"\r\n\r\nIn July, 1827, having received an invitation to succeed Professor Dana\r\nin the chair of Chemistry at Dartmouth College, Mr. Hale accepted, and\r\ndelivered his inaugural address on the day after Commencement. His\r\nesteemed and able colleagues in the Medical College were Reuben D.\r\nMussey, M.D., Prof. of Anatomy and Surgery; and Daniel Oliver, M.D.,\r\nProf. of Theory and Practice of Medicine. It should be noted that at\r\nthat period the importance of physical studies was not fully\r\nappreciated at Dartmouth. The college had not taken a scientific\r\nperiodical in half a century. There was no cabinet of minerals.\r\n\"There was not,\" writes Dr. Oliver, \"a single modern volume in the\r\ncollege library upon either Mineralogy or Geology; and scarcely one,\r\nif one, upon Chemistry, later than the days of Fourcroy or Vauquelin.\r\nThe prevailing taste was decidedly anti-physical. It was directed\r\nanother way, and not only so, but there was among the college Faculty\r\na disposition to undervalue the physical sciences.\" Dr. James F. Dana,\r\nthe predecessor of Professor Hale, writing of the college in reference\r\nto physical science, used the following remarkable expression: \"It was\r\nanchored in the stream, and served only to show its velocity.\" When\r\nProfessor Hale was engaged, his duties comprised a course of daily\r\nlectures to the medical class through the lecture term, to which\r\nlectures the members of the Senior and Junior classes were to be\r\nadmitted; and instruction to the Junior class in some chemical\r\ntext-book by daily recitations for five or six weeks. This was all.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hale, however, addressed himself to his work with\r\ncharacteristic activity and zeal. He proceeded to give each year to\r\nthe college classes a separate course of over thirty lectures, and\r\ndischarged the expenses of them himself. He substituted a larger and\r\nmore scientific text-book for that in use, and obtained an allowance\r\nof forty or more recitations instead of thirty. He laid the foundation\r\nof the cabinet of minerals by giving five hundred specimens,\r\nclassifying and labeling all additions, leaving the collection in\r\nrespectable condition with 2,300 specimens. He gave annually about\r\ntwenty lectures in Geology and Mineralogy; and for some years was the\r\nregular instructor of the Senior class in the Philosophy of Natural\r\nHistory. For two years, also, he took charge of the recitations in\r\nHebrew, and occasionally took part in other recitations; and, with\r\nanother, served as building committee during the whole process of\r\nrepairing and erecting the college edifices.\r\n\r\nDecember 11, 1827, Professor Hale wrote, in a family letter, \"I have\r\nmade out a plan, for the repair of the College building, and the\r\naddition of a building for libraries, etc., for the use of Trustees at\r\ntheir next session. It takes with the president mightily, and I think\r\nthey will make it go.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in another family letter, the first after returning from a\r\njourney, under date of March 20, 1828, he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"My arrival at Hanover was very opportune. I was looked for for\r\nsometime, and letters were about being despatched for me.... I have\r\nthe honor of being one-half of the building committee, Professor\r\nChamberlain being the other moiety, and we are commencing operations.\r\nThe prospects of the College are now so bright, _that the plan I at\r\nfirst proposed, and which was adopted by the Trustees_, is abandoned,\r\nand we are preparing to erect two brick buildings, three stories in\r\nheight, and fifty feet by seventy. One for students' rooms, and the\r\nother for public rooms.... And what is more comforting, our funds are\r\nimproving so much that the building will not distress us very much if\r\nthe $30,000 should not be realized. A good many old debts have been\r\ncollected, and are coming in, by which one building could be erected.\r\nAbout $13,000 have already been subscribed, and subscriptions are\r\ndaily arriving.\"\r\n\r\nAll this was voluntary and gratuitous work. It is no wonder that\r\nstudents thus cared for should respond, as they did, with enthusiasm\r\nand regard. Happily, in this department as well as in all others,\r\nDartmouth College is now in motion, and fully up with the foremost in\r\nthe current of physical study.\r\n\r\nDuring his last three years, Professor Hale was President of the Phi\r\nBeta Kappa Society. His portrait, presented, it is believed, by the\r\nmembers of that society, now hangs in the college library.\r\n\r\nWhile at Hanover, Professor Hale thought it his duty to resume his\r\npurpose of preaching, and was accordingly ordained Deacon by the Rt.\r\nRev. Dr. Griswold, Bishop of the Eastern Diocese, September 28, 1828,\r\nat Woodstock, Vt.; and Priest by the same bishop, in St. Paul's,\r\nNewburyport, January 6, 1831. In taking this step he violated in no\r\nrespect the charter of the college, he undertook nothing which\r\nconflicted with the duties of his professorship, he acted neither\r\nobtrusively nor illiberally; but while he occasionally preached in\r\nneighboring churches, he always, in Hanover, scrupulously observed the\r\nappointment at the village meeting-house. On Sunday nights, however,\r\nhe held a service in his own house, for his own family, and the family\r\nof Dr. Oliver, and such other communicants of the Episcopal Church,\r\nand friends, as might desire to attend. Difference in sentiment on\r\nreligious subjects, between Professor Hale and the Trustees of the\r\ncollege, and action on their part which can hardly be regarded as\r\njustifiable, led to the termination of Professor Hale's connection\r\nwith the college, in 1835.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, Professor Hale published two works, \"A Valedictory Letter to\r\nthe Trustees,\" and \"Scriptural Illustrations of the Liturgy.\" In\r\nAugust of that year he attended the General Convention of the\r\nProtestant Episcopal Church as a delegate from the Diocese of New\r\nHampshire. In October, 1836, the degree of D.D. was conferred upon him\r\nby Columbia College. In December, having had a severe attack of\r\nbronchitis, he sailed to St. Croix to spend the winter. His published\r\nletters under the signature of \"Valetudinarius\" were very pleasant to\r\nthe reading public.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the next year he entered upon the laborious and high\r\nduties of an office which occupied the remaining years of his active\r\nlife. He was elected, August 2, 1836, to the Presidency of Geneva\r\nCollege, N. Y., and entered upon his duties in the following October;\r\ndelivering an inaugural address on the 21st of December. It is of\r\ncourse impossible here to give the varied and interesting details of\r\nhis presidential life. To this institution he freely gave the wealth\r\nof his well stored and acute mind, his tried experience, and his\r\ncheerful, patient resolution. The trials were sometimes great, the\r\nlaborers few, the support scanty, and there were times when it seemed\r\nas if the one man only stood between the life of the college and its\r\ndeath. As one of the Trustees wrote, \"Life was already nearly extinct,\r\nand death would have soon followed, had not the president given\r\nhimself wholly to the work with a faith that never faltered, a\r\nperseverance which strengthened with difficulties, and a thorough\r\nconviction that his work, if well done, would promote the glory of God\r\nand his church through all time.\" And he was successful, as much so as\r\nit was within the power of one man to be, both in correcting the evils\r\nwhich he found existing, and in securing the stability of the college\r\nbeyond all peradventure. Wherever he was, in the recitation room, in\r\nthe academic circle, in the Medical School of which he was _ex\r\nofficio_ president, in the Board of Trustees, in the councils of the\r\nbishop and the Diocese, in the conferences with the Vestry of Old\r\nTrinity Church, before the Board of Regents, before the Legislature of\r\nthe State, he was always the learned, sagacious, loyal, and inspiring\r\npresident; respected and beloved always, by all who entered the circle\r\nof his influence; and illustrating daily in his own character, the\r\nsymmetry, strength, and purity of the principle by which he was\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\nDr. Hale instructed easily in every department of learning. He was\r\nmost fond of ethical and metaphysical studies. His class room will\r\nnever be forgotten by those who delighted to go to it, and regretted\r\nto leave it. His courses of lectures for many years included Civil and\r\nEcclesiastical Architecture. He loved music, and read it as easily as\r\nthe words. His diction was always remarkable for the best English,\r\nexpressed in the happiest style. His memory and power of association\r\nwere almost unerring. His temper was held in the nicest balance. In\r\npreaching he was a Chrysostom in wisdom, truth, and sweetness.\r\n\r\nWe have not space to dwell upon this theme, nor upon the wholesome\r\ninfluence which Dr. Hale exerted in the diocese in which he was\r\nplaced, both towards preparing the way for a second diocese in the\r\nState of New York, and in ministering in his place to its unity and\r\norder, when under the Episcopal charge of the noble De Lancey. In\r\n1858, he left Hobart (once Geneva) College, and in 1859 he left\r\nGeneva, with this distinguished record: \"The thorough and skillful\r\nteacher, the laborious and self-sacrificing president, the\r\nsympathizing friend, the genial companion, the judicious adviser, the\r\ncourteous Christian gentleman; in all these relations so bearing\r\nhimself as to gain the profound respect and tender affection of all\r\nwho knew him.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Hale retired to live in Newburyport, near his birth-place and by\r\nthe graves of his forefathers, with his children around him. Even then\r\n\"his influence upon the community distilled like the dews of heaven\r\nto gladden the earth.\" He departed to his rest in Paradise on the 15th\r\nof July, 1863. Dr. Hale had four sons and three daughters, of whom the\r\nsons (one has since departed) and one daughter survived him.\r\n\r\nHis published works, beside communications to newspapers on current\r\ntopics, are: \"An Address to the Public from the Trustees of Gardiner\r\nLyceum,\" 1822. \"An Inaugural Address at Gardiner,\" 1823. \"Address to\r\nthe Public in regard to the Lyceum,\" 1824. \"Introduction to the\r\nMechanical Principles of Carpentry,\" 1827. \"Sermon before the\r\nConvention of New Hampshire,\" 1830. \"Lecture before the American\r\nInstitute of Instruction, On the Best Method of Teaching Natural\r\nPhilosophy,\" 1830. \"Sermon, On the Unity of God, preached before the\r\nConvention of the Eastern Diocese,\" 1832. \"Scriptural Illustrations of\r\nthe Liturgy of the Protestant Episcopal Church,\" 1835. \"Valedictory\r\nLetter to the Trustees of Dartmouth College,\" 1835. \"Inaugural\r\nAddress, Geneva College, On the Equalizing and Practical Tendency of\r\nColleges,\" 1836. \"A Lecture before the Young Men's Association of\r\nGeneva, On Liberty and Law,\" 1838. \"Baccalaureate: Education in its\r\nRelations to a Free Government,\" 1838. \"The Present State of the\r\nQuestion,\" a pamphlet, in relation to the division of the Diocese of\r\nNew York, 1838. \"Baccalaureate: The Languages,\" 1839. \"Baccalaureate:\r\nMathematics,\" 1841. \"Lecture on the Sources and Means of Education,\"\r\n1846. \"Baccalaureate: The Position of the College, the State, and the\r\nChurch,\" 1847. \"Historical Notices of Geneva College,\" 1849. \"Sermon\r\non the Death of Major Douglass,\" 1849.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor Alpheus Crosby, who was elected to the Chair of Greek and\r\nLatin in the College, in 1833, Professor Calvin E. Stowe having filled\r\nthe position in the interval after the death of Professor Chamberlain,\r\nwas the son of Dr. Asa and Abigail (Russell) Crosby, and was born at\r\nSandwich, N. H., October 13, 1810. Although less than twenty-three\r\nyears of age, his superior scholarship fully warranted the\r\nappointment. After ably filling this chair several years, by a\r\ndivision of labor he was permitted to confine himself exclusively to\r\nthe Greek language and literature. To his refined and sensitive nature\r\nthe stern old Roman was less attractive than the more polished Greek.\r\nIt is quite probable that Professor Crosby was more largely indebted\r\nthan he himself was aware to the moulding influence of his amiable and\r\nexcellent mother, for that particular type of mind and heart which\r\nplaced him among the foremost Grecian scholars of his time. Professor\r\nCrosby's career as a linguist illustrated two distinct forms of\r\nsuccess. He excelled both as a _teacher_ and as an _author_. His\r\nsuccess as a teacher no one will question who had the privilege of\r\nlistening to his instructions, if only for a single hour. He\r\nquestioned the student with a critical eye and ear, but a womanly\r\ngentleness. His translations might well be likened to celestial music,\r\nlong pent-up in foreign caves, but now finding rich and varied and\r\nsweet expression, in the mother tongue. His success as an author is\r\nsufficiently indicated by the extensive use of his text-books,\r\nespecially the \"Greek Grammar.\"\r\n\r\nHis classmate, Rev. Dr. Tenney, says:\r\n\r\n\"It is very pleasant for me to bring back before me your brother as I\r\nremember him at the commencement of our college life. He was, as you\r\nknow, a boy of twelve years, dressed in a boy's jacket with a ruffled\r\nshirt, collar coming down over his shoulders, such as boys wore in\r\nthose days--playful as a kitten, and as innocent as the purest-minded\r\ngirl. He was probably the best fitted (as the phrase is) for college,\r\nof any member of the class. He had, I believe, gone over all the\r\nstudies of the Sophomore year. Without any apparent effort he\r\nmaintained his preëminence through his entire college course, not only\r\nin the Languages, but also in Mathematics and Mental Philosophy. My\r\nrecollection is that he had committed to memory all the Greek\r\nprimitives before he left college, yet with all his preëminence as a\r\nscholar he never seemed to have the remotest consciousness that there\r\nwas anything remarkable about himself. We had ambitious men in the\r\nclass and some bitter rivalries, but no one ever thought of\r\nquestioning his position. In short he was both the pet and pride of\r\nthe class; his conscientiousness as a boy was that which\r\ncharacterized him as a man. I do not think he would have done a\r\nconsciously wrong thing for his right hand. I remember being with him\r\none Sabbath, when a letter was handed him from home, and his views of\r\nthe sacredness of the Sabbath were such that he would not open it\r\nuntil the Sabbath was passed. I mention this, not to illustrate the\r\nearnestness of his conscience, but simply to show its authority over\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"As your brother was the youngest of the class, I was one of the\r\noldest, but from the commencement of our class life our intimacy was\r\nconstant. I could very readily tell why I was attracted to him, but\r\nhis friendship for me I could never understand; sure I was that I\r\nnever loved any other man as I did him; he visited me a number of\r\ntimes; as I was at his home in Salem not long before his lamented\r\ndeath, he seemed to me the same at the end as he was at the beginning,\r\none of the most lovable and remarkable men I ever knew, and the world\r\nhas seemed to be poorer ever since he left it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. C. C. Chase, Principal of the High School in Lowell, of the class\r\nof 1839, says:\r\n\r\n\"I have had many laborious, faithful teachers, but only one genius,\r\nand that was Professor Alpheus Crosby. He was accurate upon a point\r\nnot because he appeared to have looked it up in the books, but because\r\nhe instinctively knew it. It was in the Greek that I was instructed by\r\nhim, and I clearly recall, at this day, the expression of his face, as\r\nhe explained it to us. He seemed to revel in the beautiful thoughts\r\nand splendid conceptions of the great dramatists. He did not appear to\r\nbe so anxious as most teachers, that our recitations should show our\r\ncritical grammatical knowledge, but rather that we should appreciate\r\nand enjoy the wonderful creations of the great minds of antiquity. He\r\nloved to teach. It seemed to be his delight to tell others what he had\r\nso much enjoyed himself. It was the study of his Greek grammar that\r\nfirst gave me a love for the noble language of ancient Greece. I know\r\nof no grammar that has so few bones and so much meat in it. One can\r\nreally enjoy reading it in an idle hour! It so clearly reveals the\r\nfact that that most beautiful of languages, with all its sweetness and\r\neuphony, is but a transcript of the mind of the race of men that knew\r\nmore of beauty, of taste, and of philosophy than all the ancient world\r\nbesides. Professor Crosby entered into the secret chambers of Greek\r\nthought, and became himself a Greek, and seemed to feel a perpetual\r\nflow of delight, as he told to others what seemed so charming to\r\nhimself. Others might compel an indolent student to devote more time\r\nand study to his lessons, but none could equal him in leading those\r\nwho loved to follow, into the 'green pastures' and 'sweet fields' of\r\nthe domain of learning.\"\r\n\r\nHon. George Stevens, of the class of 1849, says:\r\n\r\n\"My acquaintance with Professor Crosby began upon my admission to\r\ncollege. My preparation in Greek was imperfect, and my knowledge of\r\nthe language was quite limited. His manner of dealing with and\r\ninstructing the class soon won my admiration, love, and respect for\r\nhim, and opened to me a new and unexpected source of pleasure in the\r\nbeauties of the Greek language. The primitive simplicity, the euphony,\r\nsweetness, and artistic perfection of the language awakened a response\r\nand an appreciation which only those who are like him can feel. This\r\nappreciation of the beauties of his favorite language, kindled in him\r\nan enthusiastic love for it. His manner of teaching imparted something\r\nof this same enthusiasm in the students. The thoroughness of his\r\ninstruction, his perfect courtesy towards all the students, the\r\nextreme kindness with which he always treated them, his constant\r\nmildness and equanimity in the presence of the class, in the face even\r\nof rude conduct and inexcusable ignorance of the lesson, his great\r\nlove and supreme devotion to his duties, apparent to all, won the love\r\nand respect, and gave him the control of every student under him,\r\nwhich no sternness or severity could ever have secured. I never knew\r\nthe least disobedience to him or the slightest disrespect shown\r\ntowards him, either in his presence or absence. The great simplicity,\r\npurity, and honesty of his character, was a perfect shield to him\r\nagainst all attacks, in word or act, open or covert. I consider him,\r\nafter years of reflection and experience, the best teacher I ever had;\r\nand of all the impressions of the teachers of my boyhood and youth,\r\nthose made by him upon me I find are the deepest and most lasting,\r\nand now, after the lapse of more than a quarter of a century, are the\r\ndearest to me.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Hagar, in the \"New England Journal of Education\", says:\r\n\r\n\"Professor Alpheus Crosby, whose death occurred in Salem, Mass., on\r\nthe 17th of April, 1874, was so widely and favorably known as a\r\nscholar, and was so much esteemed as a man, that a notice of his life\r\nand labors, more extended than has hitherto appeared, is justly due\r\nhis memory.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Crosby very early showed remarkable power in the\r\nacquisition of knowledge. He learned the rudimentary branches of\r\neducation almost without a teacher. Mathematics, Latin, and Greek came\r\nto him almost by intuition. When engaged in study, he was so deeply\r\nabsorbed that he seemed wholly unconscious of time, place, or\r\nsurroundings. When in his tenth year he was taken to Hanover, the seat\r\nof Dartmouth College, and was placed temporarily under Professor Adams\r\nin Algebra and Euclid, under Tutor James Marsh in Latin, and under\r\nTutor Rufus Choate in Greek; and these gentlemen pronounced him fitted\r\nfor college. He was then returned to Gilmanton Academy, and, to\r\nprevent him from trespassing upon college studies, he was put to the\r\nstudy of Hebrew, under the Rev. John L. Parkhurst, who was well known\r\nas a ripe scholar. He was subsequently sent to Exeter Academy to\r\nbridge over, with various studies, the months which his friends\r\nthought must be passed before he should enter college. At the fall\r\nterm of the college, in 1823, in his thirteenth year, he entered; and\r\nhe passed through the four years' course of study without a rival and\r\nfar beyond rivalry. His power of acquisition and retention was\r\nmarvelous.\r\n\r\n\"After his graduation, he was kept at Hanover four years; the first,\r\nas the preceptor of Moor's Indian Charity School, and the following\r\nthree as tutor in the college. During this period he joined the\r\ncollege church, and formed his purpose to prepare for the ministry,\r\nand spent nearly two years at the Theological Seminary, in Andover,\r\nMass. He was appointed to a professorship of Latin and Greek, in 1833.\r\nIn 1837 he was released from the Latin and became professor of Greek\r\nonly, which office he held until 1849, when he resigned; but he\r\nremained Professor _Emeritus_ until his death.\r\n\r\n\"In 1834 he married Miss Abigail Grant Jones Cutler, only child of\r\nJoseph and Abigail Cheesboro Grant (Jones) Cutler, of Newburyport,\r\nMass. Mrs. Crosby becoming an invalid, Professor Crosby took her to\r\nEurope and traveled with her through England, Germany, and France,\r\nuntil they reached Paris, where Mrs. Crosby died. On his return he\r\nresumed the duties of his professorship. After the death of his\r\nfather-in-law, Mr. Cutler, he resigned his professorship, and removed\r\nto Newburyport to care for Mrs. Cutler, who was an invalid. His Greek\r\nGrammar, theological disquisitions, and the superintendency of schools\r\nin Newburyport occupied his attention until Mrs. Cutler's death in\r\n1854, when he entered into the employment of the Board of Education in\r\nMassachusetts as its agent. In this capacity he rendered the State\r\nmost valuable services by visiting the public schools in various parts\r\nof the State, and by his instructive and practical lectures on\r\neducational subjects. So efficient were his labors, that in 1857 he\r\nwas appointed by the Board of Education to the principalship of the\r\nState Normal School in Salem; this important post he occupied eight\r\nyears. To the interests of this school he zealously devoted his great\r\nknowledge and ability, raising it to a high standard of excellence and\r\ngiving to it a most honorable reputation. He gave the school the\r\nlargest part of its valuable library, and obtained for its use the\r\nmost of its considerable cabinet. By his heartfelt kindness and his\r\nfaithful instructions he secured the love and profound esteem of his\r\npupils, who will ever hold him in affectionate remembrance. In the\r\nNormal School and elsewhere, as he had opportunity, Professor Crosby\r\nearnestly advocated the liberal education of women, believing that\r\ntheir educational advantages ought to equal those enjoyed by men.\r\n\r\n\"While principal of the school at Salem he, for several years, was the\r\neditor-in-chief of the 'Massachusetts Teacher,' performing gratuitous\r\nlabors which were highly appreciated by the teachers of Massachusetts\r\nand of other States.\r\n\r\n\"Having traveled through the Southern States, that he might gain a\r\nbetter knowledge of his own country before he went abroad, he became\r\ndeeply impressed with the iniquities of slavery, and dropped readily\r\ninto the ranks of the abolitionists. He was intensely interested in\r\nall the discussions and phases of freedom, from Adams's 'Right of\r\nPetition' crusade down to the day of his death. His patriotism during\r\nthe war was full and glowing. The political disquisitions in his\r\n'Right Way,' which he edited for a year, upon the question of\r\nreconstruction, were keen and convincing. He also published a series\r\nof elementary lessons for teaching the freed-men of the South to read.\r\n\r\n\"During all these years, after leaving his professorship,\r\nhe was building other educational books besides his Greek\r\nGrammar--'Xenophon's Anabasis,' 'Eclogæ Latinæ,' 'Lessons in\r\nGeometry,' a 'Greek Lexicon' for his Anabasis, and, last, 'Explanatory\r\nNotes to the Anabasis,' which he had nearly ready for the press when\r\ndeath closed his labors.\r\n\r\n\"The heart of Professor Crosby was full of love for everybody and\r\nevery creature of God. He drank deeply at every spring whence flowed\r\ncharity, benevolence, freedom, and patriotism. He remained to his\r\ndeath a member of an orthodox church, but, during the last years of\r\nhis life, he worshipped with Christians of other denominations, having\r\nsoftened his early faith by a more liberal trust in the boundless love\r\nand mercy of God, his Heavenly Father.\r\n\r\n\"In his association with teachers of every class, he showed himself a\r\nfriend to all. His geniality of manner, his pleasant words, his\r\nsympathizing spirit, his overflowing desire to make others happy, his\r\nseemingly inexhaustible knowledge, and his intelligent and\r\never-courteous discussion of controverted questions in education,\r\nmorals, and religion, secured for him the warm affection and deep\r\nrespect of all who were privileged to know him.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Collar, of the Roxbury Latin School, says:\r\n\r\n\"Professor Crosby belonged not to Massachusetts alone, but to all New\r\nEngland--to the whole land. Our country is poorer by the loss of an\r\neminent scholar, one of that small band of classical scholars in\r\nAmerica who are known and honored at foreign seats of learning. In the\r\nlatest, freshest, and most original Greek grammar that I am acquainted\r\nwith, that by Professor Clyde, of Edinburgh, the author acknowledges\r\nhis obligations to four distinguished scholars, three Europeans, and\r\none American, and the American is Professor Crosby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Professor Crosby's first marriage has been referred to; his second\r\nwife was Martha, daughter of Joseph Kingman, of West Bridgewater,\r\nMass.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following paragraphs, from an authentic source, introduce another\r\neminent teacher.\r\n\r\nIra Young was born at Lebanon, N. H., May 23, 1801. His parents were\r\nSamuel and Rebecca (Burnham) Young.\r\n\r\nHis early years were chiefly spent in working at his father's trade,\r\nthat of carpenter, though every winter after he was sixteen, he taught\r\nin one of the district schools in the neighborhood. He cherished a\r\nstrong desire for a collegiate education, but was not at liberty to\r\ntake any steps in that direction until he became of age. Want of means\r\nwould have been with many int his circumstances an insurmountable\r\nobstacle,--not so with him. By the willing labor of his hands, he\r\nobtained in eight months the means of fitting for college at Meriden\r\nAcademy, where he studied one year, and soon after leaving that\r\ninstitution, where he stood high in scholarship, he entered Dartmouth\r\nCollege. Neither in this year of preparation, nor during all his\r\ncollege course, did he ever receive pecuniary aid from any individual\r\nor society. He paid his way by teaching.\r\n\r\nWhile at Meriden, he became, with many of his classmates, savingly\r\ninterested in religion, and made a public profession of his faith in\r\nChrist in his native place. His religious experience, we have reason\r\nto believe, was deep and thorough,--producing an humble, loving faith\r\nin Christ as the only Saviour, and a sincere, benevolent goodwill to\r\nall around him--to all mankind. His mind was calm and peaceful--not\r\nsubject to the agitations felt by so many in their religious life, and\r\nhis trust and confidence in God were never shaken. He could never bear\r\nto hear any questioning of the ways of Providence, however dark and\r\nmysterious they might appear. \"God wills it,\" was always enough for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThrough his college course he passed with honor and success, taking\r\nhigh rank in a class which was exceptionally good, producing a large\r\nnumber of men who were afterwards distinguished in professional and\r\npublic life. Though himself guided in all things by the highest\r\nChristian principle, he yet knew how to feel for those who were in\r\ndanger of falling into evil courses; and certainly in one instance, by\r\nhis tender and watchful care, he was the means of reclaiming and\r\nsaving a young friend from threatening ruin.\r\n\r\nHe graduated in 1828, and taught afterwards for a year in Berwick\r\nAcademy, Maine, and subsequently in a large public school in Boston,\r\nfrom which, in 1830, he was called to a tutorship in Dartmouth\r\nCollege. He held that position for three years, during which he\r\ncontinued his theological studies, which he had commenced with the\r\nministry in view, and in that year he preached regularly in some of\r\nthe neighboring towns.\r\n\r\nHe gave up this purpose, however, when he received the appointment of\r\nProfessor of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Astronomy, in place\r\nof Professor Adams, who resigned at that time, August, 1833. Before\r\nthe close of that month, he became Professor Adams' son-in-law by\r\nmarriage to his youngest daughter, Eliza, and seldom were father and\r\nson more closely united in affection or more happy in mutual\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nIn regard to his qualifications for his department and success in the\r\nsame, it may be well to refer to some remarks contained in an obituary\r\nnotice of him, written by one who for many years was associated with\r\nhim in instruction, and who is now placed at the head of a sister\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Young had some qualities which fitted him eminently for\r\nthis position. He was, in the first place, thoroughly master of the\r\nscience and literature of his own department. Distinguished while in\r\ncollege for mathematical attainments, he never relaxed in careful and\r\nconstant study of those branches to which he particularly directed his\r\nattention. His mind was thoroughly disciplined for truth and not for\r\nvictory, and thus he was ready to test his attainments by the most\r\nthorough methods. As he was thorough with himself, so he was with his\r\npupils, trying them with doubtful questions which the studious could\r\neasily answer, but which the ignorant could not evade. Yet he was\r\nnever harsh, nor captious, nor irritating, though quick and ingenious\r\nin exposing mistakes and follies. Besides his ample knowledge, he\r\npossessed remarkably the power of clear and distinct statement. It was\r\nthe habit of his mind to reduce his facts to principles, and to\r\npresent them in their simplest forms. Few instructors have excelled\r\nhim in the facility with which he could disentangle and elucidate a\r\ncomplicated problem, whether for the satisfaction of his own mind, or\r\nthe instruction of another. And he was as patient as he was acute. Of\r\na quiet temperament, not easily roused, nor rendered impatient at the\r\ndullness or want of perspicuity in another, unless this resulted from\r\na moral rather than an intellectual weakness.\"\r\n\r\nIn April, 1858, he went to Europe and spent five months abroad, for\r\nthe purpose of procuring books and instruments for the college,\r\nespecially those which were needed for the equipment of the\r\nObservatory, whose foundations were laid that year. He had labored\r\nsuccessfully in obtaining funds for this object, in which he took a\r\ndeep interest, and after the completion of the building, it afforded\r\nhim much pure enjoyment, as it gave him greatly increased facilities\r\nboth for observing and instructing in his favorite field of science.\r\n\r\nTeaching was to him a real pleasure, and he often said that he would\r\nnot willingly exchange it for any other employment that could be\r\noffered him. He felt a truly affectionate interest in the young minds\r\nthat successively came under his care, sympathizing with them in their\r\nperplexities and troubles, grieving for their errors, and rejoicing in\r\nwhatever advances they made in scientific attainments and true\r\nexcellence of character. Remembering his own early struggles, he felt\r\nmuch sympathy with young men similarly situated, and often rendered\r\nthem efficient aid.... Nor was his care and interest limited\r\nexclusively to the college, but he sought to do good \"as he had\r\nopportunity,\" and in the manifold relations he sustained to others, in\r\nthe family, the church, the neighborhood, the village, his unselfish\r\nkindness was ever manifested. He held the office of Treasurer of\r\nMeriden Academy for several years after the resignation of his\r\npredecessor, and at the time of his death had been a deacon of the\r\nchurch for twenty years.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer term of 1858, he was unusually occupied with college\r\nlabors, being employed most of the day in attending his recitations\r\nand lectures, and in preparation for them. He had obtained some new\r\nphilosophical apparatus, which interested him much, and he never\r\nseemed to find more pleasure in his work than then, though it often\r\nleft him quite weary and exhausted.\r\n\r\nAt that time there was a remarkable degree of religious interest\r\nthroughout the country, in which the college and the village shared,\r\nand it resulted in numerous conversions. He often attended the\r\nnoon-day prayer meetings of the class he was then instructing, and\r\nspoke of them with much pleasure; and his own heart was deeply moved\r\nby the heavenly influence.\r\n\r\nNear the close of July he began to suffer much from a malady which,\r\nthough hidden, must have been long in progress. His sufferings were\r\nmost acute and severe, but never did he lose that sweet patience and\r\nserenity of spirit he had always manifested, nor that calm submission\r\nto his Heavenly Father's will. He died September 13, 1858.\r\n\r\nIn the words of one of his most esteemed associates: \"The village\r\nmourns, for it has lost an excellent citizen; the church mourns, for\r\nit has lost an efficient officer; the college mourns, for it has lost\r\na revered teacher; the State mourns, for it has lost an exemplary\r\nsubject,--one who belonged to that class who are justly styled 'the\r\nlight of the world!'\"\r\n\r\nFew men in America have ever been called to teach the abstruse science\r\nof Mathematics, who combined in such desirable proportions a thorough\r\nknowledge of the science with a faculty of presenting it in a pleasing\r\nmanner in the recitation room. In the happy adjustment of Professor\r\nYoung's powers one could but observe a union of quick perception with\r\nalmost perfect self-control. Whatever the deficiencies of the student,\r\na hasty or unguarded or inappropriate or even an unscientific word was\r\nseldom found in Professor Young's vocabulary. His most impressive\r\nrebuke was silence.\r\n\r\nIn a commemorative \"Discourse,\" President Lord says:\r\n\r\n\"During his college course he was an earnest and successful student.\r\nHe carried his work before him, finished it in its time, and did it\r\nwell. He studied his lessons and a few related books, and scattered\r\nnot his mind by light, promiscuous, and aimless reading. He gorged\r\nnot, but thought and digested, and never had a literary dyspepsia. Of\r\ncourse he grew right along. He was resolved, prompt, exact, untiring,\r\nand true as steel. Everybody knew where to find him. He studied no\r\npopular arts. Though never rough or crusty, he was curt and sarcastic;\r\nbut no man ever took offense who knew the kindness of his heart. His\r\nfellow-students loved him. His abilities and knowledge commanded their\r\nrespect; his moral excellence secured their confidence, and his\r\nexample gave him power over their minds and manners. He hated and\r\nreproved vice, frowned upon all disorder, disdained artifice and\r\ntrick, and stood out manfully in support of virtue. Once, in the same\r\nentry, a few noisy and vicious young men set up to be disturbers. They\r\nparticularly insulted a worthy but timid student, who was his\r\nneighbor. He took that student to his own room, and gave him\r\ncountenance and protection. Then they committed outrage upon his room,\r\nand threatened personal abuse. When his remonstrance availed nothing,\r\nhe protested that he would not see such evil perpetrated in college,\r\nbut would report them. They knew him, believed him, desisted, and gave\r\nhim then the honor of his disinterested virtue, as virtue always\r\nreceives its meed of honor when it stands erect on its own\r\nprerogative, and is not moved by the contradictions of unreasonable\r\nand wicked men. Yet he was no ascetic. He liked companionship, was not\r\nfastidious or exacting, never petulant or vindictive, but gentle and\r\nforbearing. He had especial tenderness for those 'good-hearted' young\r\nmen who can never refuse to do wrong when they are invited. A\r\ndistinguished officer of one of our professional institutions once\r\nsaid to me,--'I was, at one time, when in college, thoughtless,\r\nself-indulgent, fell among bad companions, and was nearly ruined. Mr.\r\nYoung pitied me, took hold of me, and saved me.' That excellent man\r\ncould not now speak of his benefactor without tears of gratitude.\r\n\r\n\"How he stood at college, that is, what rank he held, whether first,\r\nsecond, or a lower figure in his class, I never inquired, and, if I\r\never heard, I have forgotten. Probably he was not equally indifferent,\r\nfor if there be a more excellent way of judgment, it was not quite\r\nevident to his calculating mind. I have often admired how his\r\nprofessional bias led him in his measurement of men, almost as by\r\ninstinct, to arithmetic, as if figures must, of course, be true, and\r\nas if insensible moral and physical causes did not often greatly\r\nmodify or neutralize numerical computation. But it was a generous\r\nprejudice, and I have also admired how, in his practical judgment, he\r\nwould unconsciously neutralize or modify his professional idea. He\r\nwanted nothing but realities. He went for scholarship and not the show\r\nof it. He accepted no metal that would not ring. He was accordingly\r\njudged by others in reference to his sterling qualities. There might\r\nhave been men about him who made a greater figure than himself. It is\r\nvery likely. For, as I remember, strangers sometimes undervalued him.\r\nSoon after he left college, I was sent to offer him the place of\r\ntutor. I had not previously known him, and my first impressions were\r\nnot agreeable. I hesitated to do my errand. After all it was rather\r\nperformed than done, more after a Roman than a Saxon fashion. But it\r\nturned out better for his character and the public good, than for my\r\nown discernment. So of another commission not only from the Trustees,\r\nbut the venerable Professor Adams, to assure him that he would, after\r\na while, be wanted to take the chair of that noble old man, one of the\r\nprinces of the earth. They who knew him best had marked him, even when\r\nhe took his parchment, for that high position. How well he filled it,\r\nand every other office he sustained, everybody who knows the college\r\nknows.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Young was a consummate teacher. During his college course\r\nhe taught school every successive winter, as he had done for years\r\npreceding, and earned nearly enough to pay the expenses of his course,\r\nfor he had high wages, and never wasted them on his clothes or\r\npleasures. That discipline settled in his mind the elements of\r\nknowledge. The principles of all true knowledge were already laid;\r\nfirst, when he was born; and, secondly, when he was born again. He\r\nhad, of course, tools to work with, and facility to use them for the\r\ngood of others, enlarging all the while his own fabric till he became\r\nthe man of science that he was for his successive trusts. He loved, as\r\nfew men ever love, to teach, and as no man can love who begins not\r\nearly and makes not teaching his profession. He went to his last\r\nrecitation when he should have been upon his bed, to find relief from\r\nthe agonies he suffered, and take off his mind from the greater that\r\nhe feared. He was never more at home, or more at ease, than with his\r\nclass. He loved to enrich them out of his own stores, and thereby draw\r\nout and sharpen their independent faculties. He was not disconcerted\r\nwhen he sometimes drew to little purpose; though sure, by set\r\nremonstrance, or by his peculiar, quaint, dry and caustic humor, to\r\nrebuke indifference and neglect, or expose the artifice of a bold,\r\nshrewd, or sly pretender. He was sure of what he knew, and never gave\r\nway without a reason. I have sometimes thought him too sure before he\r\nscanned a question. Yet he would never persist when he saw no\r\nfoothold. He was set but not dogmatic, or no more so than a sincere\r\nman must be when he believes what he teaches and is in earnest. He\r\nwould never defend before his class a theory because it was new, or\r\nbecause it was learned, or because it was his own, or because it was\r\npopular, or because he would otherwise be ruled out of the synagogue,\r\ntill he had made it sure by calculus, or probable by analogy. When\r\nconvinced that an hypothesis could not be verified in the present\r\nstate of knowledge, or never in logical consistency with established\r\nfacts, or moral certainties, he abandoned it like an honest man. But\r\nwhere he had his ground he stood, and would have it understood. Of\r\ncourse his teaching was effectual. Those who would be made scholars he\r\nmade sound and good ones. He gave a strong character to his\r\ndepartments, and his departments were an honor to the college.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Young was a ripe scholar in general. He was conversant with\r\nthe accredited branches of knowledge, and held an honorable place\r\namong learned men. He was modest and retiring, content to know, and\r\nunconcerned about the appearance of it. He liked not to open his mouth\r\nin the gate, but he had wisdom to deliver the city. Nothing crude,\r\npartial, superficial, or one-sided, ever came from him. His judgments\r\nwere clear, comprehensive, and decisive. He was slow, critical, and\r\ncautious in forming his opinions, and where he settled there he\r\nstayed. No man could cajole or browbeat him out of his convictions.\r\n\r\n\"When our professor lay dead before us, the thought arose that, now,\r\nno longer plodding his way to yonder dome, with steps restrained and\r\npainful from an unknown disease, no longer weary with watching,\r\nthrough his telescope, the distant orbs, nor with numbers and diagrams\r\nto find their measure, he could survey, without a glass, infinitely\r\ngreater wonders from a higher sphere; for he had profited by his\r\nearthly discipline: the heavens had declared to him the glory of God,\r\nand the firmament had showed his handiwork. The day had uttered to him\r\nspeech, and the night had showed to him knowledge. Next it occurred\r\nhow natural religion had been thus reproduced in his mind and\r\nillustrated by a higher Revelation: 'The law of the Lord is perfect,\r\nconverting the soul; the testimonies of the Lord are sure, making wise\r\nthe simple; the statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart;\r\nthe commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR STEPHEN CHASE.--PROFESSOR DAVID PEABODY.--PROFESSOR WILLIAM\r\nCOGSWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Stephen Chase, who succeeded Professor Young in the chair of\r\nMathematics, the latter retaining the department of Natural Philosophy\r\nand Astronomy, was the son of Benjamin Pike and Mary (Chase) Chase,\r\nand was born at Chester, N. H., August 30, 1813.\r\n\r\nThe following notice of this distinguished mathematician is from a\r\ncommemorative \"Discourse\" by President Lord:--\r\n\r\n\"In the first class that entered the college, after my connection with\r\nit, nearly twenty-three years ago, a young man, spare, tall, as yet\r\nunformed in manner, soon engaged the attention of his teachers. We\r\nmarked his mild, serene, yet quick and penetrating eye, his\r\nindependent, unaffected, yet modest and regulated movement, his\r\nlively, versatile, earnest, and comprehensive mind, his cheerful and\r\nhonest diligence, his punctual attendance upon the exercises of the\r\ncollege, his respectful, but unstudied and confiding deportment\r\ntowards his superiors, his frank and generous, but reserved\r\nintercourse with his fellow students, his care in selecting his most\r\nintimate associates, and his quiet, unpretending, yet exact and\r\nintelligent performance of all the studies of the course. An\r\nindifferent stranger would not have noticed him, except, perhaps, to\r\ncriticize his unique exterior; and his fellow students, as is natural\r\nto young persons who are most impressed by æsthetical manner and\r\naccomplishment, did not dignify him as a leader or an oracle. But a\r\ndeeper insight convinced his teachers that, whatever partial observers\r\nmight think wanting in respect to artistic excellence, was well\r\nsupplied by more substantial and enduring qualities. Their eye\r\nfollowed him, while here, as a sound-minded, true-hearted young man,\r\nand a thorough scholar; and, after he had graduated, as a teacher at\r\nthe South, and in two of the oldest academies of New England. In these\r\ndifferent relations he fully justified the good name which he had left\r\nbehind him at the college, till, the proper occasions serving, he was\r\ncalled back to be first a tutor, and then professor of the\r\nMathematics. The subsequent course of Mr. Chase proved that his\r\ninstructors had not miscalculated his powers, nor over-estimated his\r\nqualifications for one of the most difficult and trying positions in a\r\nlearned institution.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Chase performed the duties of his office without\r\ninterruption till the close of the last term, during a period of about\r\nthirteen years; and died, after a short illness, in vacation, while\r\nyet a young man. He was scarcely thirty-eight years of age. Yet he was\r\nold, if we measure time, as scholars should, not by the motion of the\r\nheavenly bodies, but the succession of ideas. He had made great\r\nproficiency in knowledge. Well he might; for he had great\r\nsusceptibilities. His temperament was ardent, his instincts were\r\nlively, his perceptions keen, his thoughts rapid, his reasoning\r\nfaculties sharp, his imagination fiery, and his will determined. No\r\nman has all his active powers proportioned; for that would constitute\r\nperfection, which exists not in this world any more in physical than\r\nin moral natures. But his balance was less disturbed than most, and,\r\nconsequently, he was capable of various and large attainments. What he\r\ncould he did, for his spirit was earnest, and his industry untiring.\r\nHe had become well founded and extensively versed in most departments\r\nof liberal study, and it would be difficult to say in what branch of\r\nknowledge he would have been most competent to excel. He was not a\r\ngenius; that is, no one power of the mind absorbed the others, and his\r\nculture was not unequal. Therefore he would not have glared for a\r\nwhile, like a meteor, and then exploded, but he would have stood one\r\nof the pillars of learning, and a true conservator of society.\r\n\r\n\"A man of excellent constitutional faculties, like Mr. Chase, must use\r\nthem, if Providence gives him opportunity. He has a self-moving power.\r\nHe cannot be still. Use of the faculties increases their facility and\r\nproductiveness; and the increase of products increases the love of\r\nacquisition. His gains, and his consequent love of gain, will be\r\naccording to the Providential direction which he takes, whether to a\r\ntrade, an art, a profession, to the pursuit of wealth, or power, or\r\ngeneral knowledge. Mr. Chase's direction was to knowledge. He acquired\r\nit easily, his stores rapidly increased, and the love of it became a\r\npassion. He loved knowledge as some men love pleasure, and others\r\ngold, for its own sake. Yet not exclusively, for he was genial,\r\nwarm-hearted, and humane. He appreciated the enjoyments of personal,\r\ndomestic, and social life. No man could be more affectionate, kind,\r\ngenerous, or public-spirited. He was never a recluse or an ascetic. He\r\nwas ready to take anything in hand, and liked to have his hands full.\r\nHe desired an estate, he studied a profession, he amused himself with\r\nuseful arts, he loved a farm, a garden, an orchard, a fruitery, an\r\napiary; and occasionally, to do the work proper to them all himself;\r\nand he did it well. But knowledge, science, in the largest sense, was\r\nhis _beau ideal_.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Chase, as might be expected, had great excellence as a\r\nteacher and governor of college. His ideal of education may be\r\ninferred from his personal culture. This had always been general and\r\nliberal. He omitted no branch of important knowledge. He accepted\r\nnothing partial. He believed in none of the romantic expedients which\r\nare often hastily adopted, and successively abandoned, for making\r\nscholars without materials, and forcing public institutions of\r\nlearning, for a present popular effect, off from the methods which\r\nnature has prescribed, and experience has sanctioned. He regarded a\r\ncollege as a place not so much of learning, as of preparation for\r\nlearning,--a school of discipline, to bring the student up to manhood\r\nwith ability to perform thenceforth the hard work of a man in his\r\nparticular profession. To that end no part of fundamental study could\r\nbe spared. He would as soon have judged that young men could be\r\ntrained to excellence in the mechanic arts, while they disused any\r\nimportant organ of the body; or a sculptor elaborate a perfect model\r\nby chiseling only the limbs. He would not expect such a mechanic, or\r\nartist, or educators of the same school, to find either honorable or\r\nlucrative employment, when society, though temporarily blinded by\r\ningenious but visionary projects of improvement, should learn the\r\npractical difference between the whole of anything and its parts. He\r\nwould not have consented that any other department of college study\r\nshould be sacrificed even to the Mathematics.\r\n\r\n\"But he would have the Mathematics lie, physically, where God has\r\nplaced it, at the foundation. He would have the student early settled\r\nand accustomed to the most approved methods and varieties of\r\ndemonstrative science. He would discipline the mind among the\r\ncertainties of numbers, that it might better search for truth among\r\nthe probabilities of things; just as we learn to swim where we can\r\ntouch bottom before it is safe to plunge into the deep. He judged\r\nsoundly that one must learn to use his reason before he can wisely\r\napply it to the purposes of life; and that without this preliminary\r\ntraining nothing else can be learned well; and that whatever otherwise\r\nseem to be accomplishments, turn out, at length, to be fantasies that\r\nvanish in the turmoil and struggle of life, or mislead men into a\r\nfalse and fickle management of affairs. Wherefore he felt the peculiar\r\nresponsibility of his position with all the intenseness of his earnest\r\nand far-reaching mind. He knew that his department, though most\r\ndifficult to be commended to young men in general, was most\r\nindispensable to their success, and he sought accordingly to magnify\r\nhis office. That he was a complete master of it is out of question. Of\r\nthis he has left enduring monuments; and not the least, I am happy to\r\nsay, in minds which he had trained.\r\n\r\n\"His own perception of relations was like intuition, and hence he was\r\nsometimes uneasy at the embarrassments of students, even when\r\ninvoluntary, and much more, when the result of indifference or\r\nneglect, even though they might at times be increased by the rapidity\r\nof his own illustrations. I should have dreaded to be taken by\r\nProfessor Chase to the blackboard, unless I had a good lesson, or a\r\ngood conscience; and I could not have been sure that the latter would\r\navail me without the former. But though I should have shrunk from the\r\ncriticism, I should have respected the man. If I feared him in the\r\nlecture-room, I should honor him in his study; for there his warm\r\nheart would open to the story of my mental trials, and he would lead\r\nme, and help me to bear my burdens, with the kindness of an elder\r\nbrother. He was exacting, but he was humane; he was impatient, but\r\nfull of generous sympathies. These qualities might not always be\r\ntempered in the hurry of an occasion, but found their balance in the\r\nleisure and quiet intercourse of retirement. He was just and faithful.\r\nHe had strong likes, but he would yield a favorite when he must; and\r\nstrong dislikes, but he was incapable of hate. He stopped short of all\r\nextremes. You could move him easily either way on the current of the\r\nsympathies; but you could not tempt him to do wrong. As with the\r\njudgment, so with the sensibilities; they were led by conscience. As\r\nwith the love of knowledge, so with the passions; they were subject to\r\nthe love of truth. Whatever the occasional excitement of the intellect\r\nor the feelings, there was that in his mind which made it impossible\r\nfor him to be an enemy of God or man. The soul had been harmonized by\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chase had a pious ancestry, and was brought up by Christian\r\nparents in the fear of God. An excellent mother, an invalid in his\r\nchildhood, sat much in her arm-chair with the Bible on her knee. She\r\nused it with her little boy as she would a primer. Before he was four\r\nyears old he had learned to read it, and read through the New\r\nTestament; and that particular volume now remains the best part of his\r\nestate. He was ever afterwards a diligent student of the Bible, and\r\nnever ceased to honor the father and mother who had led him in this\r\nway of life. Filial reverence was one of his most beautiful and\r\ncharacteristic traits. It was a natural step to the fear of God; and\r\nthe early fear of God is likely to be succeeded, according to the\r\ncovenant, by that love of God which, when perfected, casteth out fear.\r\nDuring his third year at college he became, as he hoped, regenerate,\r\nand professed his faith in Christ. It is said that his religious\r\nawakening at that time was unusually deep; his awe of the Divine\r\ngovernment and his sense of sin profound; his acknowledgment of God's\r\njustice and general sovereignty unreserved; and his trust in Christ\r\nfor justification free and unqualified. That sheet-anchor saved him.\r\nIt brought him up, subsequently, in the hour of danger. When the\r\nfitful and rough winds of the spirit of the power of the air beat upon\r\nhim, and the swelling waters went over his soul, it dragged, but it\r\nheld. It was cast within the veil. That New Testament in his\r\nchildhood, that subjection to his parents, that conversion at\r\ncollege,--they were blessings to him and to us that can be measured\r\nonly by eternity.\r\n\r\n\"It was a sorrowful day when, in the solitude and stillness of the\r\nwinter vacation, we laid him in the tomb. It was sorrowful in that\r\nhouse where he had been the joy and hope of loving and trusting\r\nhearts, and had found rest from the cares and vexations of official\r\nlife; where a sincere, unworldly, unartificial hospitality always\r\nreigned; whence tokens of kindness went freely round to friends, and\r\ncompassionate charity to the poor. It was sorrowful to his colleagues,\r\nfor we trusted him, his knowledge and judgment, his integrity and\r\nzeal, his faithfulness and efficiency, his independence and courage.\r\nWe knew that he was above pretense, artifice, and duplicity; that in\r\nhis keeping, righteous principle was safe, and over his application of\r\nit wisdom, benevolence, and firmness would preside. It was sorrowful\r\nto the village, for he was known to be a just man, a kind neighbor,\r\nand a good citizen. He was always ready to do what he could for the\r\ncommon welfare, and to bear his proportion of the common burdens.\r\nEvery man in the community felt that he had lost a friend.\"\r\n\r\nThe scientific world could have no better demonstration of Professor\r\nChase's rare mathematical talents than his text book on Algebra, which\r\nis still used in one department of the college.\r\n\r\nProfessor Chase married Sarah Thompson, daughter of Ichabod Goodwin,\r\nand granddaughter of General Ichabod Goodwin, of South Berwick, Me. He\r\ndied at Hanover, January 7, 1851.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn \"Sprague's Annals of the American Pulpit,\" we find the following\r\nnotice--furnished by the kindness of Rev. Daniel L. Furbur, D.D.--of a\r\ngentleman of great worth, whose early death was a serious loss to the\r\ncollege:\r\n\r\n\"David Peabody, the youngest son of John and Lydia (Balch) Peabody,\r\nwas born at Topsfield, Mass., April 16, 1805. He was employed more or\r\nless upon his father's farm till he was fifteen or sixteen years of\r\nage; but as his physical constitution was thought to be not well\r\nsuited to agricultural life, and as his early tastes were more than\r\nordinarily intellectual, and he had a strong desire for a collegiate\r\neducation, his father consented to gratify him; and, in the spring of\r\n1821, he commenced the study of Latin at Dummer Academy, Byfield. The\r\nsame year his thoughts were earnestly directed to the great subject of\r\nhis own salvation, though he did not feel so much confidence in the\r\ngenuineness of his religious exercises as to make a public profession\r\nof his faith until three years afterwards. In 1824, he united with the\r\nCongregational Church in his native place, and in the autumn of the\r\nsame year joined the Freshman class in Dartmouth College.\r\n\r\n\"By severe labor during his collegiate course, he overtasked his\r\nnaturally feeble constitution, and thus prepared the way for much\r\nfuture debility and suffering. He was graduated in 1828, on which\r\noccasion he delivered the valedictory oration.\r\n\r\n\"After spending a few weeks in recruiting his health at his father's,\r\nhe became, for a short time, assistant editor of the 'New Hampshire\r\nObserver,' at Portsmouth, but before the close of 1828 he entered the\r\nTheological Seminary at Andover. In the spring of 1829, he accepted an\r\ninvitation to take charge of a Young Ladies' Select School at\r\nPortsmouth; but in the autumn of 1830 his declining health obliged him\r\nto relinquish it, and to seek a Southern residence. He went to Prince\r\nEdward County, Virginia, and secured a situation as teacher in an\r\nexcellent family,--that of Dr. Morton, and at the same time entered\r\nthe Union Theological Seminary, of which the Rev. Dr. John H. Rice was\r\nthe founder and principal professor. He remained in the family of Dr.\r\nMorton till he had completed the prescribed course of study, and was\r\nlicensed to preach by the West Hanover Presbytery in April, 1831;\r\nafter which he supplied the church at Scottsville for six months. So\r\nacceptable were his services, that the congregation would gladly have\r\nretained him as their pastor; but, as he preferred a Northern\r\nresidence, he declined all overtures for a settlement, and returned to\r\nNew England, with his health much improved, in 1832. In November of\r\nthe same year he was ordained pastor of the First Church in Lynn,\r\nMass. In September, 1834, he was married to Maria, daughter of Lincoln\r\nBrigham, then of Cambridge, but formerly of Southborough, Mass. In\r\nJanuary, 1835, he was attacked with a severe hemorrhage, which greatly\r\nreduced his strength, and obliged him for a season to intermit his\r\nlabors. Finding the climate unfavorable, he reluctantly came to the\r\ndetermination to resign his pastoral charge, with a view of seeking an\r\ninland home, when his health should be sufficiently recruited to\r\njustify him in resuming the stated duties of the ministry.\r\n\r\n\"Accordingly, in the spring of 1835, he was dismissed, after which he\r\nspent some time in traveling for the benefit of his health, at the\r\nsame time acting as an agent for the Massachusetts Sabbath-school\r\nSociety. His health now rapidly improved, and on the 15th of July\r\nsucceeding his dismission, he was installed as pastor of the Calvinist\r\nChurch in Worcester.\r\n\r\n\"The change of climate seemed, for a time, highly beneficial, and had\r\nbegun to induce the hope that his health might become fully\r\nestablished; but, in the winter of 1835-36, he was prostrated by\r\nanother attack of hemorrhage, which again clouded his prospects of\r\nministerial usefulness. In the spring of 1836, his health had so far\r\nimproved that he resumed his ministerial labors and continued them\r\nthrough the summer; but in September, his symptoms again became more\r\nunfavorable, and he determined, in accordance with medical advice, to\r\ntry the effect of a sea voyage and a winter in the South. Accordingly,\r\nhe sailed in November for New Orleans; and, on arriving there, decided\r\non going to St. Francisville, a village on the Mississippi. Here he\r\nremained during the winter, preaching to both the white and colored\r\npopulation, as his strength would allow. In the spring, he returned to\r\nhis pastoral charge, with his health considerably invigorated. He\r\nlabored pretty constantly, though not without much debility, until the\r\nsucceeding spring (1838), when he found it necessary again to desist\r\nfrom his labors, and take a season of rest. In company with a friend,\r\nhe journeyed through a part of Vermont and New Hampshire, and on\r\nreaching Hanover, the day after Commencement, was surprised to learn\r\nthat he had been appointed professor of Rhetoric in Dartmouth College.\r\nConscious of his inability to meet any longer the claims of a pastoral\r\ncharge, and hoping that his health might be adequate to the lighter\r\nduties of a professorship, he could not doubt that the indications of\r\nProvidence were in favor of his accepting the appointment. He did\r\naccept it, and shortly after resigned his charge at Worcester, amidst\r\nmany expressions of affection and regret on the part of his people,\r\nand, in October following, entered on the duties of his professorship.\r\n\r\n\"The change of labor proved highly beneficial, and during the winter\r\nof 1838-39, he enjoyed a degree of health which he had not known for\r\nmany previous years. In March, he was so much encouraged in respect to\r\nhimself that he remarked to a friend that he thought God would indulge\r\nthe cherished wish of his heart, and permit him again to labor as a\r\nminister. But another cloud quickly appeared in his horizon, which\r\nproved ominous of the destruction of all his earthly hopes. In April\r\nfollowing, he suffered from an attack of pleurisy, which was followed\r\nby lung fever; and, though he so far recovered as to be able to attend\r\nto his college duties till the September following, it became manifest\r\nto all that his disease was, on the whole, advancing towards a fatal\r\ntermination. He died at the age of thirty-four years and six months,\r\non the 17th of October, 1839. His last days were rendered eminently\r\ntranquil by the blessed hopes and consolations of the gospel. His\r\nfuneral sermon was preached by the Rev. Dr. Lord, President of\r\nDartmouth College, and was published. He left no children.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Peabody's published works are a brief 'Memoir of Horace Bassett\r\nMorse,' 1830; a Discourse on 'The Conduct of Men Considered in\r\nContrast with the Law of God,' 1836; a 'Sermon on the Sin of\r\nCovetousness, Considered in Respect to Intemperance, Indian\r\nOppression, Slavery,' etc., 1838; the 'Patriarch of Hebron, or the\r\nHistory of Abraham' (posthumous), 1841.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE REV. SAMUEL G. BROWN, D.D.\r\n\r\n    \"Dartmouth College, July 25, 1856.\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir: It gives me great pleasure to send you my impressions of\r\nProfessor Peabody, though others could write with more authority. I\r\nknew him in college, where he was my senior. He belonged to a class of\r\ngreat excellence, and was honorably distinguished throughout his\r\ncollege course for general scholarship, diligence, fidelity, and great\r\nweight of personal influence, in favor of all things 'excellent and of\r\ngood report.' His character was mature and his mind already well\r\ndisciplined when he entered the class, and education had perhaps less\r\nto accomplish for him in the matter of elegant culture than for almost\r\nany one of his associates. Hence there was not the same conspicuous\r\nprogress in him as in some others. Yet at the time of graduation he\r\nstood among the first, as is indicated by the fact that he was the\r\norator of one of the literary societies, and was selected by the\r\nFaculty to deliver the valedictory oration at Commencement. In every\r\ndepartment of study he was a good scholar,--in the classical, moral,\r\nand rhetorical departments, preëminent. As a preacher, he was\r\ndistinguished for a certain fullness and harmony of style, justness in\r\nthe exposition of doctrine, and weight of exhortation. He was prudent\r\nwithout being timid, and zealous without being rash; eminently\r\npractical, though possessing a love of ideal beauty, and a cultivated\r\nand sensitive taste, and as far removed from formalism on the one side\r\nas from fanaticism on the other. Dignified and courteous in manner, he\r\nwas highly respected by all his acquaintances, and while a pastor,\r\ngreatly esteemed and beloved by his people. His fine natural qualities\r\nwere marred by few blemishes, and his religious character was steadily\r\nand constantly developed year by year. Grave, sincere, earnest, he\r\nwent about his labors as one mindful of his responsibility, and as\r\nseen under his 'great Task-master's eye.' Indeed his anxieties outran\r\nhis strength, and he was obliged to leave undone much that was dearest\r\nto his hopes. The disease to which he finally yielded had more than\r\nonce 'weakened his strength in the way,' before he was finally\r\nprostrated by it. The consequent uncertainty of life had perhaps\r\nimparted to him more than usual seriousness, and a deep solicitude to\r\nwork while the day lasted. He performed the duties of a professor in\r\ncollege but a single year, and that with some interruptions. No better\r\naccount of the general impression of his life on those who knew him\r\nbest can be given than in the language of a sermon preached at his\r\nfuneral by the Rev. Dr. Lord.\r\n\r\n\"'What his private papers show him to have felt in the presence of his\r\nGod was made evident, also, in his social and official intercourse.\r\nIntelligent, grave, dignified; conscientious in all his relations,\r\nfrom the student upwards to the teacher, the pastor, the professor;\r\nnothing empty as a scholar, nothing unsettled or inconsistent as a\r\ndivine, nothing vague or groundless as an instructor; sincere,\r\ngenerous, honorable, devout; keenly sensitive in respect to the\r\nproprieties and charities of life; warm in his affections, strong in\r\nhis attachments, stern in his integrity; above the arts of policy, the\r\njealousies of competition, the subserviency of party spirit, and\r\nsimply intent upon serving God, in his own house, and in all his\r\nofficial ministrations, he was one of the few who are qualified to be\r\nmodels for the young, ornaments to general society, and pillars in the\r\nchurch of God.'\r\n\r\n\"Hoping, dear sir, that this hasty and imperfect sketch may be of some\r\ntrifling service in commemorating a good man, who deserves something\r\nmuch better,\r\n\r\n\"I am very truly your obedient friend and servant,\r\n\r\n    \"S. G. Brown.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE REV. JOHN NELSON, D.D.\r\n\r\n    \"Leicester, July 23, 1856.\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir: My personal acquaintance with the Rev. Mr. Peabody was\r\nlimited to the period during which he was the pastor of the Central\r\nChurch, in Worcester. While he held that office, I had, I may say, an\r\nintimate,--certainly a most happy, acquaintance with him. I often saw\r\nhim in his own house, and often received him as a welcome guest in\r\nmine. I often met him in the association to which we both belonged and\r\nin ecclesiastical councils.\r\n\r\n\"I remember him as having a rather tall and commanding figure, and a\r\nbenign countenance, beaming with intelligence, especially when engaged\r\nin conversation. This appearance, however, was modified by constant\r\nill health. No one could be with him without receiving the impression\r\nthat he was a scholar, as well as a deep and accurate thinker.\r\n\r\n\"The few sermons which I heard him read, or deliver from the pulpit,\r\nwere of a high order, distinguished for both accuracy of style and\r\npower of thought. They were clear, methodical, and highly eloquent. It\r\nwas my own impression, and I know it was the impression of some of his\r\nmost distinguished hearers, that he was among the best preachers of\r\nhis time. In ecclesiastical councils he was shrewd, discerning, and\r\nwise. As a friend, he was always reliable. His moral character was not\r\nonly high, but well balanced, and marred by no inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n\"It is presumed that no one will dissent from the statement that,\r\nduring the few years he was in Worcester, by his intelligence, his\r\nmanly virtues, his kindness of heart, his active labors for the\r\nadvancement of Christ's kingdom, and his ability as well as\r\nfaithfulness as a preacher, he greatly commended himself, not only to\r\nthe people of his immediate charge, but to the whole community in\r\nwhich he labored.\r\n\r\n    \"Affectionately yours,\r\n    \"John Nelson.\"\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to \"Sprague's Annals of the American Pulpit\" for yet\r\nanother notice--furnished by the kindness of Rev. Daniel Lancaster--of\r\na gentleman widely known to the friends of education and religion.\r\n\r\n\"William Cogswell, the son of Dr. William and Judith (Badger)\r\nCogswell, was born in Atkinson, N. H., June 5, 1787. He was a\r\ndescendant from John Cogswell, of Westbury, Wiltshire, England, who,\r\nwith his family, sailed from Bristol in a vessel called the 'Angel\r\nGabriel,' June 4, 1635, and was wrecked at Pemaquid (now Bristol),\r\nMaine. He settled at Chebacco, now Essex, then a part of Ipswich,\r\nMass., where he died November 29, 1669, about fifty-eight years old.\r\nHis father was distinguished as a physician and a magistrate, and held\r\nthe office of hospital surgeon in the army during the war that gave\r\nus our Independence. His mother was a daughter of the Hon. Joseph\r\nBadger, of Gilmanton, a gentleman of great respectability and for a\r\nlong time in public life.\r\n\r\n\"Under the influence of good parental instruction, his mind was early\r\nformed to a deep sense of the importance of religion; but it was not\r\ntill he was fitting for college at Atkinson, that he received those\r\nparticular religious impressions which he considered as marking the\r\ncommencement of his Christian life. He did not make a public\r\nprofession of religion until the close of his Junior year, September,\r\n1810; at that time he, with both his parents, and all his brothers and\r\nsisters, nine in number, received baptism, and were admitted to the\r\nchurch on the same day, in his native place, by the Rev. Stephen\r\nPeabody.\r\n\r\n\"He became a member of Dartmouth College in 1807. Having maintained a\r\nhighly respectable standing in a class that has since numbered an\r\nunusual proportion of distinguished men, he graduated in 1811. For two\r\nyears after leaving college, he was occupied in teaching in the\r\nAtkinson and Hampton Academies. But, during this time, having resolved\r\nto enter the ministry, he commenced the study of Theology under the\r\ndirection of the Rev. Mr. Webster of Hampton, and subsequently\r\ncontinued it under Dr. Dana of Newburyport, and Dr. Worcester of\r\nSalem,--chiefly the latter. Having received license to preach from the\r\nPiscataqua Association, September 29, 1813, he performed a tour of\r\nmissionary service in New Hampshire, and at the close of December,\r\n1813, returned to Massachusetts, and accepted an invitation to preach\r\nas a candidate for settlement, in the south parish in Dedham. After\r\nlaboring there a few weeks, he received a unanimous call, which, in\r\ndue time, he accepted, and on the 20th of April, 1815, he was duly set\r\napart to the pastoral office. Here he continued laboriously and\r\nusefully employed about fourteen years, during which time the church\r\nunder his care was doubled in numbers, and enjoyed a high degree of\r\nspiritual prosperity.\r\n\r\n\"In June, 1829, he was appointed general agent of the American\r\nEducation Society, and he accordingly resigned his pastoral charge\r\nwith a view to an acceptance of the place. He entered upon the duties\r\nof his new office in August following, and so acceptable were his\r\nservices, and so well adapted was he found to be to such a field of\r\nlabor, that in January, 1832, he was elected secretary and director of\r\nthe Society. His duties now became exceedingly arduous, and his\r\nsituation one of vast responsibility. In addition to all the other\r\nlabors incident to his situation, he had an important agency in\r\nconducting the 'Quarterly Journal and Register of the American\r\nEducation Society,'--a work that required great research, and that has\r\npreserved much for the benefit of posterity which would otherwise have\r\nbeen irrecoverably lost.\r\n\r\n\"In 1833, he was honored with the degree of Doctor of Divinity, by\r\nWilliams College.\r\n\r\n\"It became manifest, after a few years, that Dr. Cogswell's physical\r\nconstitution was gradually yielding to the immense pressure to which\r\nit was subjected. He accordingly signified to the Board of Directors\r\nof the Education Society his intention to resign his office as\r\nsecretary, as soon as a successor could be found. He was induced,\r\nhowever, by their urgent solicitation, to withhold his resignation for\r\na short time; though in April, 1841, his purpose was carried out, and\r\nhis resignation accepted. The Board with which he had been connected,\r\nrendered, on his taking leave of them, the most honorable testimony to\r\nthe ability and fidelity with which he had discharged the duties of\r\nhis office.\r\n\r\n\"On the same month that he determined on resigning his place in the\r\nEducation Society, he was appointed by the Trustees of Dartmouth\r\nCollege, professor of History and National Education. Here again his\r\nlabors were very oppressive, as he was obliged not only to prepare a\r\ncourse of lectures on a subject comparatively new, but to perform much\r\nother service, especially in the way of collecting funds to endow his\r\nprofessorship. He was chiefly instrumental, at this time, in\r\nestablishing the Northern Academy of Arts and Sciences, and of\r\ngathering for it a library of about two thousand volumes.\r\n\r\n\"But while he was thus actively and usefully engaged, he was invited\r\nto the presidency of the Theological Seminary at Gilmanton, in\r\nconnection also with the professorship of Theology, and a general\r\nagency in collecting funds. There were many circumstances that led\r\nhim to think favorably of the proposal, and finally to accept it. He\r\naccordingly removed his family to Gilmanton, in January, 1844.\r\n\r\n\"His expectations in this last field of labor seem scarcely to have\r\nbeen realized. The removal of one of the professors to another\r\ninstitution, devolved upon him an amount of labor which he had not\r\nanticipated, and he found it impossible to attend to the business of\r\ninstruction, and at the same time to be abroad among the churches\r\nsoliciting pecuniary aid. At length, finding that the public mind was\r\ngreatly divided as to the expediency of making any further efforts to\r\nsustain the institution, he recommended that its operations should,\r\nfor the time being, be suspended; though he considered it as only a\r\nsuspension, and confidently believed that it had yet an important work\r\nto perform. He held himself ready after this to give private\r\ninstruction in Theology, whenever it was desired.\r\n\r\n\"In 1848, Dr. Cogswell suffered a severe domestic affliction in the\r\ndeath of his only son,--a young man of rare promise, at the age of\r\ntwenty. This seemed to give a shock to his constitution from which he\r\nnever afterwards fully recovered. He acted as a stated supply to the\r\nFirst Church in Gilmanton until the early part of January, 1850, when\r\nhe was suddenly overtaken with a disease of the heart that eventually\r\nterminated his life. He preached on the succeeding Sabbath (January\r\n13), but it was for the last time. He performed some literary labor\r\nafter this, and read the concluding proof sheet of a work that he was\r\ncarrying through the press for the New Hampshire Historical Society.\r\nWhen he found that death was approaching, though at first he seemed to\r\nwish to live, that he might carry out some of his plans of usefulness,\r\nnot yet accomplished, he soon became perfectly reconciled to the\r\nprospect of his departure. He died in serene triumph,--connecting all\r\nhis hopes of salvation with the truths he had preached,--April 18,\r\n1850. His funeral sermon was preached by the Rev. Daniel Lancaster of\r\nGilmanton, and was published.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Cogswell was a member of the Massachusetts Historical Society, of\r\nthe American Antiquarian Society, and of the New England Historic and\r\nGenealogical Society. He was also an Honorary Member of the Historical\r\nSocieties of New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, and Georgia, and a Corresponding Member of the\r\nNational Institution for the Promotion of Science at Washington.\r\n\r\n\"The following is a list of Dr. Cogswell's publications 'A Sermon on\r\nthe Nature and Extent of the Atonement,' 1816. 'A Sermon containing\r\nthe History of the South Parish, Dedham,' 1816. 'A Sermon on the\r\nSuppression of Intemperance,' 1818. 'A Catechism on the Doctrines and\r\nDuties of Religion,' 1818. 'A Sermon on the Nature and Evidences of\r\nthe Inspiration of the Sacred Scriptures,' 1819. 'A Sermon before the\r\nAuxiliary Education Society of Norfolk County,' 1826. 'Assistant to\r\nFamily Religion,' 1826. 'A Sermon on Religious Liberty,' 1828. 'A\r\nValedictory Discourse to the South Parish, Dedham,' 1829. 'Theological\r\nClass Book,' 1831. 'Harbinger of the Millennium,' 1833. 'Letters to\r\nYoung Men Preparing for the Ministry,' 1837. In addition to the above,\r\nDr. Cogswell wrote the 'Reports of the American Education Society' for\r\neight years--from 1833 to 1840; and two 'Reports of the Northern\r\nAcademy.' He was the principal editor of the 'American Quarterly\r\nRegister' for several years; was editor also of the 'New Hampshire\r\nRepository,' published at Gilmanton, N. H.; of the first volume of the\r\n'New England, Historical and Genealogical Register;' of a paper in\r\nGeorgetown, Mass., called the 'Massachusetts Observer,' for a short\r\ntime; and of the sixth volume of the 'New Hampshire Historical\r\nCollections.'\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Cogswell was married on the 11th of November, 1818, to Joanna,\r\ndaughter of the Rev. Jonathan Strong, D.D., of Randolph, Mass. They\r\nhad three children,--one son and two daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE REV. SAMUEL G. BROWN, D.D.,\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR IN DARTMOUTH COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n    \"Hanover, April 10, 1856.\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Sir: I had the pleasure of considerable acquaintance with the\r\nRev. Dr. Cogswell, though only during the later years of his life. He\r\nwas not then accustomed to preach, except occasionally to supply a\r\nvacant pulpit, or as a part of his duty as secretary of the Education\r\nSociety, or in connection with his professorship in Dartmouth College,\r\nor the Theological Seminary at Gilmanton. He had formed his style on\r\nthe model of the older preachers and theologians, and if he had\r\nsomething of their formality, he had much of their Scriptural\r\nsimplicity of statement and devoutness of feeling. His sermons, so far\r\nas I remember them, though showing a careful adherence to the\r\ndoctrinal opinions of the fathers of New England, were not of a\r\npolemic character, but were marked by good sense, earnestness, a\r\nBiblical mode of address, and warm Christian sympathies.\r\n\r\n\"From natural kindness of heart, he avoided unnecessary controversy,\r\nand was especially solicitous to harmonize and unite by charity,\r\nrather than by acuteness to discriminate differences among brethren,\r\nor to separate them by severity of judgment. Not ambitious, he was yet\r\ngratified by the approbation and good opinion of others, and loved a\r\nposition where he might be prominent in labors of charity. Neglect or\r\ncontumely wounded but did not embitter him. No feeling of ill-nature\r\nwas suffered to disturb his peace or check his liberality.\r\n\r\n\"Among the prominent traits of his character was a sincere and\r\nunwearied benevolence. He was interested in young men, and his labors\r\nas secretary of the American Education Society were stimulated even\r\nmore by love of the work than by a sense of official responsibility.\r\nHe was thoroughly devoted to the objects which interested him, and\r\nthough one might differ from him in judgment with respect to measures,\r\nnone doubted his sincerity or refused him the praise of unsparing\r\nfidelity.\r\n\r\n\"His tastes led him to antiquarian pursuits, and he was prominent in\r\nfounding and conducting several learned societies which have done much\r\nto rescue valuable knowledge from oblivion, and thus to secure the\r\nmaterials for future history.\r\n\r\n\"He bore adversity with meekness and patience. What might have crushed\r\na harder spirit, but gave his greater symmetry. The latter years of\r\nhis life, though darkened with many disappointments, were illustrated\r\nby the exhibition of admirable and noble traits of character, such as\r\nfew, except his most intimate friends, supposed him so fully to\r\npossess. The death of an only and very promising son while in college,\r\nand the failure of some favorite plans, seemed only to develop a\r\ntouching and beautiful Christian resignation and a high magnanimity.\r\nNot a murmur was heard from his lips under his irreparable loss, nor\r\nan unkind or reproachful word at the disappointment of his\r\nexpectations; nor did an unsubmissive or harsh thought seem to find a\r\nplace in his heart. Those especially who witnessed his last sickness\r\nwere deeply impressed with the Christian virtues and graces which\r\nfound a free expression in the hour of trial.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Cogswell was portly in appearance, grave and dignified in his\r\nbearing, and eminently courteous in manner. He will be remembered with\r\nkindness by all who knew him, and by many with a feeling of strong\r\ngratitude and affection.\r\n\r\n\"With great regard, your obliged friend and servant,\r\n\r\n    \"S. G. Brown.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nPROF. JOHN NEWTON PUTNAM.--PROF. JOHN S. WOODMAN. PROF. CLEMENT\r\nLONG.--OTHER TEACHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following notice of the eminent scholar who succeeded Professor\r\nCrosby in the chair of Greek, is from a Commemorative \"Discourse\" by\r\nProfessor Brown.\r\n\r\nJohn Newton Putnam was the son of Simeon and Abigail Brigham (Fay)\r\nPutnam, and was born December 26, 1822, in what was then the north\r\nparish of the beautiful town of Andover, Massachusetts. His father, a\r\ngraduate of Harvard in the Class of 1811, was for many years teacher\r\nof a classical school of high character in North Andover, in which the\r\nson received his elementary training and discipline. His mother was a\r\nlady of exquisite refinement and beauty of character, of great\r\ngentleness and tender grace. Soon after the death of his father, in\r\n1833, he entered Phillips Academy in Andover, then under the charge of\r\nthat excellent scholar, Mr. Osgood Johnson, where he successfully\r\ncompleted the usual course of study preparatory to entering college.\r\n\r\nBeing still quite young, and already showing uncommon aptitude for\r\nstudy, he went with his instructor and friend, Rev. Thatcher Thayer,\r\nto the town of Dennis, upon Cape Cod, where he spent four years in\r\nquiet and delightful application.\r\n\r\nDr. Thayer says of his classical studies:\r\n\r\n\"He recited each day, in review, the whole of the past lesson from\r\nmemory, without book, first the Latin or Greek and then the English.\r\nAt each lesson questions were asked which, if he could not answer, he\r\nwas required to answer at the next recitation, from various helps\r\nfurnished him. This often led to long and varied investigations. He\r\nwrote as much as he read,--perhaps more.\r\n\r\n\"If those studying with him might smile a little at his want of\r\nathletic zeal and vigor, there was no room for smiling when it came to\r\nGreek, or indeed any mental exercise. Besides, his wit, though gentle,\r\ncould gleam, and then they all respected him for his character, and\r\nloved him for his winning spirit.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1840, he entered the Sophomore class of this college,\r\nready to make full use of the ample opportunities granted him. With\r\nwhat modesty and beauty he bore himself here, with what fidelity in\r\nevery relation, with what admirable scholarship, with what generous\r\naims, with what simplicity and purity of motive, with what love of\r\nlearning, and desire not merely of meeting the claims of the\r\nrecitation-room, but of perfecting himself in every branch of liberal\r\nculture, how constantly this noble desire possessed him from his first\r\nday among us down to the closing hour when he discoursed so fitly and\r\nwith such maturity on \"Poetry--an instinctive philosophy,\" those know\r\nbest who were most familiar with his college life. One testimony to\r\nthis is so full and generous, and of such weighty authority, that I\r\ncannot forbear to give it. It is from the accomplished scholar who\r\nfilled the chair of Greek for many years before Professor Putnam.[46]\r\n\r\n      [46] Professor Alpheus Crosby.\r\n\r\n\"I could not hope,\" he says, \"to express, by any words at my command,\r\nthe peculiar charm which Professor Putnam's scholarship and character\r\nhad for me. I never heard him recite without being impressed with the\r\nwonderful perfection of his scholarship. His translation was so\r\nfaultlessly accurate, and yet in such exquisite taste, his analysis\r\nand parsing were so philosophical and minutely exact, and his\r\ninformation upon illustrative points of history, biography,\r\nantiquities, and literature, was so full and ready, that I listened\r\nwith admiration, and to become myself a learner. How often I had the\r\nfeeling that we ought to change places I and when I had decided to\r\nresign my situation in the college, my mind immediately turned to him\r\nas a successor, assured that the college would be most fortunate if it\r\ncould secure his services.\" It need not be said how fully Professor\r\nPutnam reciprocated this esteem, nor what value he attached to the\r\nexact and thorough discipline of his instructor.\r\n\r\nNor was it in the department of languages alone that he was\r\ndistinguished, but almost equally in every other, as much in those\r\nstudies which demand the independent and original action of the mind\r\nas those which mainly require close attention, and the faculty of\r\nacquisition. His modesty was then, as always, so marked, and his ideal\r\nof excellence so high, that it required some sense of duty to bring\r\nhis powers to a public test. He never thrust himself into a place of\r\nresponsibility, or sought distinction for distinction's sake.\r\n\r\nHe had in college the desire and purpose which he always retained,--to\r\ncomplete himself in every art and every manly exercise. Hence his\r\nstudy of music, not only as a recreation, but as a discipline; not\r\nmerely to gratify the ear, though exquisitely fond of the art, and\r\nreceiving from it a refined and exalted pleasure, but also that he\r\nmight become acquainted with the thoughts and conceptions of men great\r\nin musical genius. The Handel Society, which, from the constant\r\nchanges of its members, must necessarily fluctuate,--the annual losses\r\nnot always being met by corresponding gains,--was then in a high state\r\nof efficiency. For the sake of study and musical acquisition, it\r\nboldly grappled with the difficult works of eminent masters, and with\r\nwhatever necessary imperfectness of actual performance, it was with\r\nsure and lasting results of musical ability and taste and knowledge.\r\nIt was in this society, I suppose, that Professor Putnam first became\r\npractically acquainted with some of the great works of Handel and\r\nHaydn, Beethoven and Mozart, and with the lighter but yet substantial\r\nexcellencies of some of the English masters. Here he cultivated and\r\ndisciplined his nice ear to the instinctive perception of the hidden\r\nharmonies of poetry, to the _feeling_ of those finer beauties which\r\nhardly admit of expression in anything so clumsy as our actual speech.\r\n\r\nThe desire for physical accomplishment led him to join a military\r\ncompany then existing in college, although he had no love for such\r\nthings, but rather a native repugnance to them, and there was then no\r\nspecial demand for the discipline.\r\n\r\nThe six years following his graduation were divided between\r\ninstruction in Leicester, Massachusetts, and Newport, Rhode Island,\r\nand pursuing his professional studies in the Theological Seminary at\r\nAndover. During this time he reviewed and consolidated his knowledge.\r\nHe brought himself into nearer contact with practical and common life.\r\nHe enlarged his sphere of observation and the circle of his studies,\r\nand was looking forward with great satisfaction to the actual\r\nperformance of the duties of his profession, when he was invited to\r\nthe chair of Greek in this college. It was a position entirely suited\r\nto his tastes, his capacities, his studies. He brought to it not only\r\nample learning and tastes delicate and cultivated, but the enlarged\r\nand generous spirit of a true scholar, and the aptness of an\r\naccomplished instructor. His ideal of attainment and of duty was very\r\nhigh, and he aimed at once to fit himself, by the most generous\r\ncourses of study, to illustrate the more perfectly to his classes the\r\npoetry, the eloquence, the philosophy, of the wisest and most refined\r\npeople of the whole ancient world.\r\n\r\nIt was with no narrow or exclusive spirit, nor with a merely technical\r\npurpose, that Professor Putnam pursued his studies, or directed those\r\nof others. Every true book was a nucleus around which all thought and\r\nknowledge of similar kind were grouped,--a central point from which\r\nhis mind radiated in all directions within the sphere of the subject.\r\nCould he read Plato and Aristotle without studying the course of\r\nancient philosophy and its influence on the modern? or Demosthenes,\r\nwithout an investigation of the virtues and failings of Athenian\r\nstatesmen? or Thucydides, without meditation on the causes of the\r\ndesolation of empires and states? or Homer and Sophocles, without a\r\nquick comparison with Dante and Milton and Shakespeare? It was indeed\r\na characteristic of Professor Putnam, and one cause why his knowledge\r\nwas becoming, had indeed become, at once so ample and so serviceable,\r\nthat it was not an accumulation of facts disconnected or bound\r\ntogether by mere accidental associations, but an organic growth, every\r\nfibre of the most distant branch tracing itself back to the one trunk,\r\nand the sap from the living root feeding and nourishing the whole.\r\n\r\nIn his special profession, Professor Putnam would be allowed to hold\r\nrank among the very best. The most kind and winning of teachers, he\r\nwas the most exacting and stimulating. By questions sharp, pertinent,\r\nand various, thoroughly testing the knowledge of the student, he at\r\nonce made him feel his deficiencies, and inspired him to supply them.\r\nEven the dull and careless felt the singular fascination of his look\r\nand tone, caught something of the life of his spirit, and were\r\ngradually lifted above themselves. Gentle, affable, ready to\r\ncommunicate, dignified, thorough, patient, and learned, never harsh,\r\nnever repulsive, he was earnest to meet every want of the student. His\r\nwhole course was marked by unwearied fidelity.\r\n\r\nTo instruct was an occupation and a duty, to which he made everything\r\nelse yield. He was thoroughly desirous to help those who came under\r\nhis care, so revealing to them their own deficiencies, and so placing\r\nbefore them the methods and results of a better scholarship, as to\r\nincite them to new exertions, and aid them to independent and vigorous\r\nactivity. No one, unless very groveling and earthy, could be long\r\nunder his training, without insensibly catching something of the finer\r\nspirit of a beautiful discipline. His own philosophic thought imparted\r\nits movement to their minds, and many are they who have gone from\r\nthese halls, within the last fourteen years, who can trace back to him\r\nsome of their best methods of study.\r\n\r\nLanguage was, in his view, no dead product, but the finer breath and\r\neffluence of the national life, as subtle, as many sided in its\r\naspects, as the national spirit itself,--into the knowledge of which\r\none must grow by slow degrees, bending his pliant mind till it\r\ngradually yields to the new channels of thought and expression.\r\n\r\n\"An unfaithful scholar,\" says one of his pupils, \"was gently yet\r\nunmistakably reminded of his delinquency, perhaps by assistance being\r\nomitted upon a point which he might easily have ascertained for\r\nhimself. One whom he saw struggling to learn he invariably helped, and\r\nthis help was given so kindly that many a one would try to make a good\r\nrecitation if only to gratify one so much beloved. The best scholars\r\nwere quickened by his most delicately expressed appreciation of their\r\nvictories, and even sluggish souls felt an unwonted light and warmth\r\nstirring in them when they came into his presence. I remember well our\r\nlast recitation in Greek. It was from Plato. He started with an idea\r\nof the noble philosopher, Christianized it, and gave it to us in a few\r\nsimple, sublime words, with an attitude and _look_ that melted the\r\nhearts of all.\r\n\r\n\"It has sometimes occurred to me that he could not seem constantly to\r\nothers as he did to me, like one who had dropped from a higher sphere,\r\nto remain a little while in order to draw the hearts that should love\r\nhim to a purer, higher, and better life. But conversation with others\r\nhas shown me that it has long been a general impression that he moved\r\nin a realm above the common level of even the best men.\"\r\n\r\nThere was still another aspect in which Professor Putnam presented\r\nhimself, which should not be passed over without at least an allusion.\r\nHaving completed his professional studies, his own tastes and higher\r\naims, no less than the wishes of his friends, induced him occasionally\r\nto exercise the functions of the Christian ministry. Hence he sought\r\nand received ordination according to the usages of the Congregational\r\nchurches, and in that relation stood in his lot. With what earnestness\r\nand pureness of motive, with what loftiness of purpose and fidelity in\r\nhis high calling, and acceptance to those who heard him, I need not\r\ntry to express. But I may say that it was not for want of solicitation\r\nthat he did not exchange his professorship for places of considerable\r\npublic importance in the other calling. It was his duty, a belief of\r\nhis fitness for his post, that kept him from some inviting fields of\r\nlabor elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHaving referred in fitting terms to his call to the Andover\r\nTheological Seminary, to the closing scenes in his life, and to his\r\ndeath at sea, Professor Brown says in conclusion:\r\n\r\n\"Few lives were more perfect than his, whose youth gave so fair a\r\npromise, whose riper years so fully redeemed the pledge. His presence\r\nshall still go with us all, to excite us to new fidelity, to enkindle\r\nwithin us nobler affections, to inspire us with holier purposes.\"\r\n\r\nHis classmate Rev. Dr. Furber says:\r\n\r\n\"The ripe and rare scholarship of my beloved classmate and friend,\r\nJohn Newton Putnam, was the fruit of diligence and the love of study\r\nin one whose acquisitions were easily and rapidly made. Mr. Putnam\r\nnever seemed to be a hard worker, but knowledge was continually\r\nflowing to him as by a process of absorption from his early childhood\r\nuntil he became the accomplished and brilliant scholar that he was as\r\nprofessor of Greek. His books were his constant companions, their\r\nsociety was his pleasure and pastime, he preferred it, even in his\r\nboyhood, to the sports and recreations for which most boys neglect\r\ntheir studies. When in college he sat up at night after other students\r\nwere in bed to pursue the study of German and other modern languages\r\nnot then required by the college course. This he did from the pure\r\nlove of these studies, without the aid of a teacher, and without the\r\nsocial stimulus of any companionship in such pursuits. And he probably\r\nfor the sake of study neglected needful bodily exercise every year of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n\"In the study of languages he found a fascination. The marvelous Greek\r\ntongue was of course the richest field for him, the language of a\r\npeople of the finest and subtlest intellect, and of the highest\r\nculture in the art of speech. He seemed at home in that wonderful\r\nlanguage as much almost as if it had been his mother tongue. The\r\nelegance and vivacity, the felicity and energy of his translations\r\nfrom Thucydides or Plato showed that he not only comprehended his\r\nauthor and saw the subject as he saw it, but that he had fairly caught\r\nthe glow of the author's mind from the page which he had written.\r\n\r\n\"So accomplished a student of language could not have been ignorant of\r\nhis rank among his fellow students; but in all my intimacy with him,\r\nboarding at the same table, occupying for a few months the same room,\r\nand spending with him more or less time every day either in social\r\nintercourse or in the enjoyment of vocal or instrumental music, I\r\nnever knew him to betray, by word or act or look, a consciousness of\r\nhis superiority to the poorest scholar in the class.\r\n\r\n\"Oblivious as he was, apparently, of the deficiencies of others, he\r\nwas quick enough to perceive their merits. A fine recitation or an\r\neminently creditable performance of any college exercise, no matter by\r\nwhom, gave him positive enjoyment, which in his nervous and emphatic\r\nway he was very apt to express. It is really not too much to say that\r\nhe appeared to enjoy the successes of others as much as though they\r\nhad been his own.\r\n\r\n\"What a help to any college class is the influence of one such man!\r\nHis connection with the class of 1843, was, no doubt, the presentation\r\nto some of its members of an ideal such as they had not formed before;\r\nan ideal, not only of enthusiasm for the largest acquisitions and the\r\nfinest culture, but of that enthusiasm sustained by the love of\r\nexcellence for its own sake, and not alloyed by any merely selfish\r\nambition to surpass others.\r\n\r\n\"A spirit of scholarship so high, so broad, so generous as this could\r\nbe no mark for envy. None of us grudged our classmate his position or\r\nhis honors. He was the beloved associate, and is now the warmly\r\nremembered friend of some of us, and no doubt many of us were more\r\nindebted to his example than we were aware of at the time for anything\r\nthat was well and worthily done by us in our college days.\r\n\r\n\"I ought not to close this notice without speaking of Mr. Putnam's\r\nlove of music. Music was born in him as much as Greek was, and he\r\nlearned one as rapidly as he did the other. When in college he was a\r\nvaluable member of the Handel Society, his influence being always in\r\nfavor of the introduction for practice of the standard and classic\r\nauthors. Haydn's 'Creation' and other works of that great composer\r\nwere an unfailing source of delight to him. Their naturalness and\r\nspontaneity, their brightness and cheerfulness, their artistic finish\r\nand exquisite grace, met precisely the corresponding qualities in his\r\nown mind. As we often choose those authors who are most unlike\r\nourselves, so he knew how to enjoy the rugged grandeur of less\r\npolished writers. He could listen to a mountain chain of choruses in\r\n'Israel in Egypt,' or to a dark and mazy labyrinth of mingled harmony\r\nand discord in Beethoven, and wherever he saw the perfection of art or\r\nthe power of genius, his soul was like a harp of a thousand strings\r\nevery one of which was alive with vibration. I well remember with what\r\nelevation of feeling and intensity of utterance he used in the Handel\r\nSociety to sing 'The Hallelujah Chorus,' and the concluding chorus of\r\nthe Messiah, 'Worthy is the Lamb that was slain.' His deeply religious\r\nsympathies were touched by the sentiment of these great choruses, and\r\non this account his enjoyment of them was more profound than his\r\nenjoyment even of the finished models of Haydn. He knew and felt that\r\nhe was on a grander theme, and that Redemption was greater than\r\nCreation. And it is pleasant to think of him now as saying with a\r\ndeeper meaning and a more rapturous devotion than he knew on earth,\r\nand may we add, a more thrilling musical delight, 'Worthy is the\r\nLamb.'\"\r\n\r\nWe append some of the closing lines of the venerable Dr. Thayer's most\r\ntouching and eloquent tribute to the character of his beloved and\r\nhonored pupil: \"He did in quality, more than in quantity, beyond any I\r\never had to do with. He was under more stimulus than mere quiet\r\npleasure in study. He had a most delicate sense of beauty to be\r\ngratified, a fine power of discrimination which sought objects for its\r\nexercise. Then his love for his mother was a very powerful motive;\r\nthen too I think he thought of gratifying and honoring his teacher,\r\nwho loved him and tried to make him a scholar. But better, he loved\r\nhis Saviour and increasingly studied with humble loyalty to him. Still\r\nwe must not put Putnam in a wrong place. He was preëminently made for\r\na classical scholar.\"\r\n\r\nRev. Dr. Leeds adds:\r\n\r\n\"I became acquainted with Professor Putnam in the winter of 1860-61,\r\nand was on intimate terms with him up to the time of his death, more\r\nthan two years later....\r\n\r\n\"Of his scholarship, others can speak more fitly than I. All remarked\r\nthat he was pervaded by that which is beautiful in the wonderful\r\nlanguage and literature he taught, as ever a vase by the perfume of\r\nits flowers.\r\n\r\n\"But it is his character on which I love to dwell. Ever after I had\r\nbecome well acquainted with him, he was a delightful illustration to\r\nme of the power of love to foster diverse and even opposite elements\r\nof character. He had feminine traits, and yet he was thoroughly\r\nmanly; the gentleness and tenderness of a true woman were his, and so\r\nwere the dignity and courage of a true man. He could speak, and was\r\nwont to speak, and preferred to speak words of kindness the most\r\nwinning; but he could administer a rebuke longer to be remembered than\r\nmost men's; though _more_, perhaps, because it came from him than for\r\nany other reason. The union in him of fastidious taste and of\r\nuncritical temper was very marked. No man was more sensitive than he\r\nto all the proprieties of the occasion; and one might at first fear\r\nlest himself should say or do what would jar upon that delicately\r\nattuned spirit, for whatever _he_ said or did was perfect in its\r\nmanner. And yet no one--no one--would listen with more simple\r\nenjoyment to the plainest, crudest utterances of others. He had not\r\none word of criticism to offer. He seemed to see--I am confident he\r\ndid see--only what was good and attractive in them. But one thing\r\ncould offend him, that which indicated a want of sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"More than any man I ever knew, he saw the good in every person, and\r\nthe bright in everything. It was wonderful, it was delightful, it\r\nrebuked one, and it quickened one, to note the manifestations of this\r\ntemper. Nothing, seemingly, could occur that did not present some\r\noccasion for gratitude. After the fearful disaster which hurried his\r\nlife to its close, his message home was--how characteristic of him all\r\nwho knew him will at once recognize,--'Tell them to thank God for our\r\ndeliverance!'\r\n\r\n\"I must not say much more. His friends need no reminders of his\r\ninnocent, sunny playfulness, or his abounding, sparkling--but never\r\ntrenchant--wit. As one of them has said of another, 'What bright,\r\ngraceful conceits often fell from his lips, his soft, dark eye smiling\r\nat his own unexpected thought!' And yet, such was his gracious nature\r\nthat he was the delight of the house of prayer as much as of the\r\nfriendly circle, the one who would be chosen alike to share our hours\r\nof gayety, and to extend to us the sacramental cup. In fine, his\r\nqualities were refined, blended, and crowned by love--love which often\r\nsuggested to others the name of St. John.\r\n\r\n\"No notice of him would be adequate that did not at least refer to\r\nhis wife,--fitting companion to such a man. A daughter of Prof.\r\nWilliam and Mrs. Sarah Chamberlain, she inherited both the attractive\r\nand the sterling traits of her parents. 'Lovely and pleasant in their\r\nlives, in their death they were not divided.'\"\r\n\r\nEsthetic and solid culture have very rarely had a more nearly perfect\r\nunion in any American scholar than in Professor Putnam. Whether in the\r\nprivacy of his home, in the recitation room, or before a large\r\naudience, his words were always chosen with a marked regard for\r\nfitness and beauty. His knowledge of the minutest points of every\r\ntheme which he discussed was so exhaustive and complete that any\r\nattempt to improve would have been almost like carrying light to the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nThe graces of his heart corresponded with those of his person and\r\nmind. His earnest piety was marked and felt by all who came within the\r\nsphere of his influence. Few Christian teachers have passed away, at\r\nthe age of forty, more highly esteemed than Professor Putnam. He died\r\non the return voyage from Europe, near Halifax, October 22, 1863.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1851, the chair of Mathematics was rendered vacant by the death of\r\nProfessor Chase, and he was succeeded by John Smith Woodman, a member\r\nof the Rockingham County Bar. He was the son of Nathan and Abigail H.\r\n(Chesley) Woodman, and was born at Durham, N. H., September 6, 1819.\r\n\r\nExtended experience as a teacher in the South, and foreign travel, had\r\ngiven valuable expansion to Professor Woodman's naturally capacious\r\nmind. He was a careful, patient, laborious teacher of the Mathematics.\r\nHe did not exact excellence from every student, for he fully realized\r\nthat a lack of native fondness for the studies of this department\r\nrendered it impossible for some to appear in the recitation-room, with\r\nas full preparation as others. But he strove to have each do the best\r\nin his power, and his kindness induced many to put forth earnest\r\neffort, who would have been less inclined to do so under a different\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nOne well qualified to appreciate him says:\r\n\r\n\"As an instructor in Mathematics, a field proverbially difficult,\r\nProfessor Woodman had but few equals. Such was his superiority when a\r\nstudent in this department, that there was little difficulty in\r\nchoosing a successor to the post made vacant by the sudden and\r\nuntimely death of Professor Chase. The action of the Trustees was most\r\ncompletely justified by the ease and thoroughness with which Professor\r\nWoodman took up and carried forward the work of his honored and\r\nlamented predecessor.\r\n\r\n\"In the class-room, however subtle or complicated the subject, or\r\nhowever dull the student lucklessly 'called up,' his demeanor was\r\nalways evenly calm, without a shade of impatience; he carried a firm,\r\nsteady hand, master alike of himself and the subject in hand.\r\n\r\n\"Under his direction the field of Mathematics was not left to mere\r\ntheoretical cultivation. At an early date, the first class under his\r\ncare was marshaled in squads under self-chosen captains who were first\r\ntrained by the professor in practical handling of compass, theodolite,\r\nand sextant; and then each led his division to out-door work, taking\r\nthe various instruments in turn. He was also able to invest even\r\nAnalytical Geometry and Integral Calculus with charms for some of the\r\nclass. One student came from a private interview in a high state of\r\nenthusiasm over the eloquent suggestiveness of formulæ in the\r\nvocabulary of Calculus.\r\n\r\n\"Written examinations, now so common, were among the methods\r\nintroduced into his department by Professor Woodman, and that class\r\nstill remembers the spectacles quietly adjusted, that his\r\nnear-sightedness might not encourage an illicit use of + and -, and\r\nthe rigid silence which shut them up to the simple problems written\r\nupon the blackboard, notwithstanding adroit questions, ostensibly\r\ninnocent and necessary.\r\n\r\n\"In the Chandler Scientific School, to which Professor Woodman was\r\nafterwards assigned, he was specially qualified to do good work,\r\nbecause of his thorough mastery of Mathematics by perceptions almost\r\nintuitive. Thoroughly at home in its principles, loving them, and\r\nhonestly loving his pupils, he could luminously and patiently teach\r\nthe application of those principles in practice, however minute and\r\ndetailed.\r\n\r\n\"Mention of Professor Woodman as an instructor would be incomplete,\r\nwere there no allusion to the force and influence of his character as\r\na man, transparently honest, and grandly true. He taught well from\r\ntext-books, but his life, so unaffectedly simple and just, gave\r\nbetter, deeper, and more lasting instruction.\"\r\n\r\nAn associate in the Faculty says:\r\n\r\n\"Professor Woodman becoming somewhat weary of the continuous and\r\nlaborious drill of young men in a department not generally\r\nappreciated, and feeling a renewed desire to return to the practice of\r\nlaw, resigned his professorship, and removed to Boston for that\r\npurpose. After a year's experience of the practice, or desire of\r\npractice, of law, the professor was ready to return to his field of\r\nlabor in the college. His former department was no longer open, the\r\nplace having been filled, on his resignation, by the appointment of\r\nProfessor Patterson. He was, therefore, appointed Professor of Civil\r\nEngineering in the Chandler Scientific School. On entering upon his\r\nduties, he was made the chief executive officer, under the president,\r\nof the department, and continued to hold that relation to the school\r\ntill his death. Professor Woodman proved himself a thorough, able, and\r\nzealous teacher in his new chair, and by degrees became deeply\r\ninterested in the Scientific Department, and devoted his time and\r\nenergies to building it up and making it a success. He early became\r\nsensible of the importance of the free-hand drawing, and gave it a\r\nprominent place in the curriculum of the School, which it has\r\ncontinued to hold. The depth of Professor Woodman's love for the\r\nSchool, and the strength of his desire for its continued prosperity,\r\nwere made manifest in his will by a generous donation to its funds.\r\nThose who graduated from the Chandler Department while it was under\r\nthe administration of Professor Woodman, will never cease to love and\r\nrevere his memory.\"\r\n\r\nA classmate, distinguished for his interest in general education,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"Professor Woodman was county commissioner of schools, and secretary\r\nof the New Hampshire Board of Education, during the year 1850. He was\r\nagain county commissioner during the years 1852 and 1853. In 1854 he\r\nwas commissioner and chairman of the board which was composed of the\r\ncommissioners of the several counties. In the opinion of the most\r\ncompetent judges, Professor Woodman was one of the wisest and most\r\nefficient state school officers New Hampshire has ever had. He was\r\nadmirably qualified for the work of an educator, not only by the cast\r\nof his methodical, organizing mind, but by his varied experience and\r\nscholastic attainments. He was eminently practical in all his plans\r\nfor the improvement of the schools, and he knew well how to adapt\r\nmeans to ends. His reports, both as commissioner and secretary, were\r\nof a high order of excellence, and they were highly beneficial in\r\npromoting the cause of education in the State.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Woodman married Mary Ann, daughter of Stephen Perkins\r\nChesley, of Durham, and adopted daughter of Edward Pendexter. He died\r\nat Durham, N. H., May 9, 1871.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1853, Professor Clement Long, who was the son of Samuel and Mary\r\n(Clement) Long, and was born at Hopkinton, N. H., December, 31, 1806,\r\nwas called to the chair of Intellectual Philosophy which had been\r\nvacated by the resignation of Professor Haddock. He was a thorough\r\nteacher. Being himself a most profound thinker, he deemed it his duty\r\nto exact a thorough knowledge of every day's lesson by the student. If\r\nhe had not made himself master of the subject, by learning all that\r\nwas to be learned from the text-book, any attempt to supply the\r\ndeficiency, by drawing upon his own resources, would be sure to be\r\nfollowed by the plainest marks of dissatisfaction or merited rebuke on\r\nthe part of Professor Long. Never indulging in the diffuse or the\r\ndiscursive himself, he never tolerated such a course on the part of\r\nthe student. A mere glance at the man was sufficient to indicate the\r\nrichest and most solid type of mind. Those who sat under his\r\ninstruction, and were capable of appreciating it, will ever remember\r\nhis efforts in their behalf with the liveliest gratitude.\r\n\r\nIn a commemorative \"Discourse,\" President Lord says: \"He was graduated\r\nat this college in 1828, a classmate and intimate friend of the late\r\nand lamented Professor Young, and a worthy associate of the many\r\nhonorable men by whom the class of that year has been distinguished.\r\n\r\n\"It was here, in a time of unusual religious awakening among the\r\nstudents, that he became a Christian, and, with several of his\r\nclassmates, made profession of his faith,--a profession ever\r\nafterwards honored by a singular devotedness to his Saviour. That he\r\nwas a regenerate man, and true to his Christian calling, no one who\r\nknew him ever doubted. It was manifested by the perhaps best of all\r\nevidences, as construed by experienced observers,--the uniform\r\nprevalence of an unworldly and super-worldly spirit. He affected\r\nnothing, he pretended nothing; but whatever he said or did significant\r\nof religious character was traceable, and traceable only, to a\r\nbelieving and loving mind. If any thought him severely religious, that\r\nmay have been the fault of his critics rather than his own.\r\n\r\n\"After leaving college, he was for three years a preceptor,\r\nprincipally at Randolph, Vt.; then, for two years, a theological\r\nstudent at Andover. Before completing his term at that institution, he\r\nwas called, in 1833, to the professorship of Intellectual Philosophy\r\nin Western Reserve College, at Hudson, Ohio. After a short term of\r\nservice he was elected to the professorship of Theology, in the same\r\ninstitution, and received ordination as a minister of the gospel.\r\nThese changes are all significant of early and distinguished worth.\r\n\r\n\"In 1851 he received and accepted the appointment of professor of\r\nTheology in the Seminary at Auburn, N. Y.\"\r\n\r\nHis classmate Professor Folsom says:\r\n\r\n\"Professor Long was like a precious stone kept long in the lapidary's\r\nhands before its brilliancy met the public gaze. I had my home under\r\nhis father's roof, and sat daily at table with him, during my Junior\r\nyear. We were colleagues afterwards, together with our classmate\r\nJarvis Gregg, in the Western Reserve College; and they both were\r\nmembers of my family there. We had been Handelians at Dartmouth (as\r\nalso Peabody), and almost every evening we sang together, at our\r\nfireside, from Zeuner's \"Harp.\" How precious the memory of those\r\nhours! How often has the uplifting power of all our intercourse been\r\nfelt! Professor Long, like Professor Young, joined the love of\r\nMathematics with that of Metaphysics, but the bent of his genius was\r\nstrongly in the direction of the latter, and not least in theological\r\nand moral science. He had the enthusiastic regard both of the Faculty\r\nand students of the Western Reserve College. He was also a very\r\nsuggestive and quickening preacher, often at my request taking my\r\nplace in the pulpit of the chapel. His great modesty, and not easily\r\nsatisfied ideal, kept him from publishing much in his lifetime; but I\r\nhave wondered that some of his writings did not find their way into\r\nprint after his death. He once told me, when urging him to this step,\r\nthat he hoped, in the course of ten years or so, to be able to prepare\r\nsomething which the ear of the public might not be careless to hear.\r\nHe had the same clear-cut features that marked Professor Peabody,\r\nthough of a different pattern,--the latter with outward, the former\r\nwith inward, gaze.\"\r\n\r\n\"In 1853,\" President Lord continues, \"he was transferred to the\r\nposition which he held in this college till his death, leaving the\r\nhonorable office which he had so lately assumed, at Auburn, partly out\r\nof his great love for his Alma Mater, and partly, to minister to his\r\nrevered parents in their advanced years.\r\n\r\n\"In all these relations the qualities which I have suggested laid the\r\nfoundation of his acknowledged excellence. In all the departments\r\nwhich he successively occupied he was regarded, as among the most\r\nlearned, able, and effective teachers and preachers of the country. He\r\nwas competent to every service required of him, and gave to every\r\nposition dignity and honor. He was distinctively Christian in them\r\nall, and made them subservient to no school or party, but to the\r\ngospel through which he had been saved.\r\n\r\n\"Wherein Professor Long was like other men, he was above the\r\ngenerality, and, though he aspired not to lead, was fitted to precede\r\nthem. Wherein he was unlike them, the difference was more conspicuous.\r\nHis peculiarities were striking, and in them we perceive his most\r\nobservable traits, whether of the intellect or the heart.\r\n\r\n\"I know not whether it were most of nature, or habit, that our friend\r\nwas so distinguished for acuteness, directness, and singleness of the\r\nmind,--a mind not especially intuitive and rapid, not noticeably free\r\nin its conceptions, wide in its survey, or comprehensive in its\r\ngeneralizations, moving rather on an extended line than an enlarged\r\narea, but subtle and clear as light; sharp, piercing and\r\ndiscriminating as electricity; pointed, direct, and exact as the\r\nmagnet; conclusive, positive, and decisive as the bolt of heaven. His\r\nprocesses were simple, natural, easy, and continuous, not stiffly\r\nregulated by scholastic laws, but strictly conformable, and his\r\nresults inevitable. Give him his definitions and his postulates which,\r\nthough not given, he would, like other resolved reasoners after his\r\nmethod, sometimes take, at his own risk, and he would go round or\r\nthrough the circle, or make his traverses in darkness and storm, and\r\nnever lose his meridian, or be confused in his reckoning; and he would\r\ncome back precisely to his starting-point laden with success, his\r\npoints all proved. It was well said of him by a curious and critical\r\nobserver of scholars, that, as a logician, he was not exceeded in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"Our professor had made large attainments in the science to which he\r\nwas especially devoted,--the Metaphysics. He read whatever was worth\r\nthe reading, of which, however, he chose to be an independent judge,\r\nbut he thought more, so that his attainments were emphatically his\r\nown. He was not like what so many now become in this department of\r\nstudy,--a mere follower, imitator, panegyrist,--but a searching critic\r\nand judicious commentator. He had a higher range of speculative\r\ninquiry than most of the more ambitious men who have exceeded him in\r\npopular effect, and he corrected his inquiries by a better logic, and\r\na more simple faith. But I have sometimes thought him too much of a\r\nrecluse for his greatest profiting in this respect. He loved best the\r\nretirement of his own study, and was rarely seen outside of it, except\r\nwhen required by his official duties. He abjured the artificial forms\r\nand fashions of social life, the bustling confusions of trade and\r\ncommerce, and the whirl and finesse of political agitations. He never\r\nwould stand on a platform, nor be seen at an anniversary, nor harangue\r\na popular assembly. He was happiest in solitude where, undisturbed, he\r\ncould solve the abstruse problems of ethics, or be a delighted critic\r\nof metaphysical theories, or seek to penetrate the mysteries of\r\ntheology. He was consequently in danger of contemplating his\r\nsubjects, like so many others of his time, both in Church and State,\r\ntoo much in their refined essence, and too little in their\r\ncomprehensive practical relations; rather as things, in his judgment,\r\nought to be, than as they are; too much in the light of a fictitious\r\nprinciple, and too little in that of experience, history, and analogy;\r\nrather according to God's original constitution than the actual\r\nnecessities of a fallen state; too much as they may be in the ultimate\r\ndevelopment of God's moral providence, and too little as they are in\r\nits administrative course. Hence, but for the greatest care which, in\r\nthe main, he exercised, he would have been likely to crowd into his\r\ndefinitions and postulates more than they naturally admitted, or to\r\nmake them less than they naturally required; to mistake, for the basis\r\nof his fulcrum, a speculative subtlety instead of a practical reality;\r\nand, consequently, to make his inexorable logic draw too much, or to\r\nlittle, for legitimate practical effect. If, occasionally tempted by\r\nthe excitement of our present types of speculative and conjectural\r\nscience, he seemed to overstep the limits which God has prescribed to\r\nus in our present probationary state, and to make the human a measure\r\nof the Divine, it was done not presumptuously, from a spirit of\r\nconceited and ambitious intermeddling with things forbidden, but\r\nunconsciously, from an honest desire for knowledge. When he perceived,\r\nas he was not slow to perceive, that many of the objects which now so\r\nmuch allure the learned men of the world, who are falsely so called,\r\nwere not real, but ideal and conceptional only, not actual knowledge\r\nverifiable by a day-light test, but shadows and chimeras chasing one\r\nanother over the moonlit sky, then he retreated. He chose to stop,\r\nreverentially, as taught by Scripture, when he must, rather than to be\r\ndriven back by the cherubim and the flaming sword. Not even Kant, or\r\nColeridge, or any of their living imitators, however congenial their\r\nrespective tastes for speculative subtleties, could tempt him so to\r\ndisregard the boundary between reason and faith as to lose sight of\r\nCalvary, or mistake an _ignis fatuus_ for the Sun of Righteousness.\r\nHis college experience, and, I have sometimes thought the _genius\r\ncollegii_, with a father's and mother's teachings and prayers, all\r\nfavored by the Spirit who only searcheth the deep things of God, kept\r\nhim near and true to the everlasting Word.\r\n\r\n\"But we forgot all his speculative trials and temptations, we forgot\r\nalmost that he was not perfect but in part, when, in his sacred\r\ncharacter, and in this sacred place, he laid aside his weapons of\r\nintellectual warfare, and, with his peculiar meekness of wisdom,\r\nsimplicity of statement, power of argument, and cogency of appeal,\r\ntestified to us the great things of the kingdom of God, so far as he\r\nhad learned them out of the Holy Scripture. Very instructive and\r\naffecting it was, when, as sometimes, the aspiring philosopher, the\r\nuncompromising logician, the astute economist, the grave and learned\r\ndogmatist, renounced these and all other accomplishments of nature, or\r\nrather made them subservient to the greater accomplishments of grace.\r\nThen we admired, even to tears of thankfulness, how the wise man, in\r\nbecoming a fool, becomes truly wise; how he who could be great among\r\nhis fellows on Mars Hill,--great after the fashion of the\r\nAreopagus,--could be greater, after a higher fashion, in declaring the\r\nGod there Unknown; in repeating simply the lessons of that heavenly\r\nwisdom which none of the princes of this world knew; and, with a\r\nchild-like sincerity and earnestness, from his own sense of the\r\nsufficiency of redeeming mercy, inviting us to 'The Lamb of God who\r\ntaketh away the sin of the world.'\r\n\r\n\"It might seem that one so abstract and speculative, so contemplative\r\nand reserved, would naturally be wanting in those sensibilities and\r\naffections which are justly reckoned indispensable to the highest\r\nexcellence of character, and to the happiness, or the relief, of our\r\npresent state. But appearances do not necessarily represent, but more\r\nfrequently conceal, realities. I have been permitted to read some of\r\nhis most familiar letters, which reveal a sunny and cheery side of his\r\ncharacter which I had not learned from personal observation. That he\r\nhad a susceptible and generous heart no man ever doubted. But one must\r\nknow what he has written to his friends, out of its unperceived\r\nfullness, to appreciate those hidden sympathies of his nature which\r\nbrought him into harmony as well with the outer as the inner world.\r\nFew would have a better relish for innocent festivities, or the\r\npleasures of travel, or the grander and finer works of nature or art.\r\nFew would be more excited by the sparkle or roar of ocean, the\r\nmagnificent scenery of Centre Harbor, the sublime panorama of the\r\nWhite Mountains, or the quiet beauties of the Connecticut valley.\r\nTrue, such objects engaged him but for a time. They were not his chief\r\ngood. He wanted the higher satisfactions of enlarged knowledge, of\r\nspeculative insight, of reasoning activity, of professional\r\nengagement. They were not his work, but his pastime. Yet, when he\r\nplayed, it was with as great enjoyment as any man can have who plays\r\nalone, and far greater than they have, or can have, who do naught but\r\nplay in company, who care for little but sights and sounds, at length\r\nsickened and enfeebled by their very tastes, incapable of grave and\r\ndignified pursuits, disgusted by their own vanities, remorseful at\r\ntheir own intemperate hilarities, saying, at last, of laughter, 'It is\r\nmad, and of mirth, what doth it?' Stoical he may have been, for that\r\nbelongs, almost of course, to natural magnanimity, and familiarity\r\nwith large and elevated themes; but ascetic and cynical he was not,\r\nand could not have been, with his appreciation of Christian truth, and\r\nexperience of a Saviour's love.\r\n\r\n\"The scholar, teacher, preacher, learned, profound, effective,\r\nvenerable in all relations, has passed away; the good man, regenerate\r\nby the grace of God, trusting in the righteousness of Christ, and\r\nhoping for salvation only through redeeming blood; the righteous man,\r\nstern and inflexible in his integrity, who never dissembled, never\r\nprofessed what he did not feel, never hated, never spoke evil of his\r\nneighbor, and could and did say that he was never angry at his\r\nbrother; the faithful man, who was true to his engagements, kept his\r\npost, and, in weariness and painfulness, performed his appointed work\r\ntill he was struck with death; the husband, father, friend, of whom,\r\nin these relations, it were impertinent to speak particularly, while\r\nwounded spirits are already telling, too much, how great his value,\r\nand how great their loss. He has passed away, dying as he had lived,\r\nand taught, and preached,--in faith; peaceful as a little child, and\r\nhopeful of that better state where that which is perfect will come,\r\nand that which is in part shall be done away.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Long published a sermon before the W. R. Synod in 1847, a\r\ndiscourse on \"The Literary Merits of Immoral Books,\" in the same year,\r\n\"Inaugural Address at Auburn,\" in 1858, a sermon in Dartmouth College\r\nChurch, \"Jesus Exalted yet Divine,\" in 1859, and a memorial sermon on\r\nProfessor Roswell Shurtleff, in 1861. In 1836, with Professor Gregg,\r\nhe assumed the editorship of the \"Ohio Observer\" published at Hudson.\r\nIn their first address to their readers is this passage: \"In relation\r\nto the subject of slavery we shall take the high ground that man is\r\nman and cannot therefore be treated and used as property without sin,\r\nthat immediate emancipation is a duty, and that it is therefore the\r\nduty of every man to pray and strive in every virtuous way for the\r\nabolition of slavery.\" The last date of an editorial is June, 1837.\r\n\r\nProfessor Long married Rhoda Ensign, daughter of Alpha Rockwell, of\r\nWinsted, Connecticut. He died at Hanover, October 14, 1861.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPropriety forbids more than the briefest reference to a large number\r\nof the worthy living, who have been, or who still are numbered among\r\nDartmouth's professors, in the Academical department. Otherwise we\r\nmight dwell, with profit, upon the name of the able theologian, George\r\nHowe; of the eminent linguist, Calvin E. Stowe; of that strong and\r\ngraceful master of the English, the Latin, and the Greek, Edwin D.\r\nSanborn, who is now just passing the threshold of the \"three score and\r\nten,\" and completing nearly a half century of various and valuable\r\nconnection with his Alma Mater; of Oliver P. Hubbard, who is still\r\npatiently and skillfully unfolding the secrets of science in halls\r\nwhich have echoed his voice for more than forty years; of Samuel G.\r\nBrown, the music of whose chaste and charming lectures on Rhetoric\r\nstill lingers in the ears of a long line of pupils; of Daniel J.\r\nNoyes, whose fidelity, courtesy, and kindness in the chairs of\r\nTheology and Philosophy have given him a warm place in the hearts of\r\nnearly thirty classes; of James W. Patterson, whose pupils have\r\nwatched the turning of the thoughts of an admired and honored teacher\r\nfrom Natural to Political Science, with unceasing interest, and\r\nfollowed him through the vicissitudes of public service, with\r\nundiminished affection; of Charles A. Aiken, the critical and\r\naccomplished linguist, whose loss by the college was deemed almost\r\nirreparable; of William A. Packard, who, in a kindred department gave\r\nearly promise of his later success; of Charles A. Young, whose\r\nscientific researches have added to the fame of his family, his\r\ncollege, and his country. Nor should the service rendered to the cause\r\nof science by Henry Fairbanks and John R. Varney, while professors at\r\nDartmouth, escape our notice.\r\n\r\nA proper estimate of the value of the services of those who are now\r\nmanfully and successfully bearing \"the burden and heat of the day,\"\r\nand bidding fair to do so for years to come, in this important field,\r\nwith its slender pecuniary rewards, of Samuel C. Bartlett, Henry E.\r\nParker, Elihu T. Quimby, Charles H. Hitchcock, John C. Proctor,\r\nCharles F. Emerson, and John K. Lord, must be left to a future\r\nhistorian.\r\n\r\nThe tutor's chair at Dartmouth has been filled by many men of high\r\npromise, some going to premature graves, others to what they deemed\r\nmore inviting fields. Among them we find such names as Calvin Crane,\r\nMoses Fiske, Asa McFarland, John Noyes, the value of whose instruction\r\nwas gratefully acknowledged by Dartmouth's most illustrious son a\r\nquarter of a century after his graduation, Thomas A. Merrill,\r\nFrederick Hall, Josiah Noyes, Andrew Mack, John Brown, Henry Bond,\r\nWilliam White, Rufus W. Bailey, James Marsh, Nathan Welby Fiske, Rufus\r\nChoate, Oramel S. Hinckley, John D. Willard, Henry Wood, Ebenezer C.\r\nTracy, Ira Perley, Silas Aiken, Evarts Worcester, Jarvis Gregg, and\r\nSamuel H. Taylor. We cannot dwell upon individual merit, nor give even\r\nthe names of all who have rendered valuable service in this sphere.\r\n\r\nThe \"Indian Charity School,\" also has had many teachers of\r\ndistinguished worth. Among them we find such names as Benjamin\r\nTrumbull, the historian, to whom we have referred heretofore; Ralph\r\nWheelock, the favorite son of the honored founder, who would doubtless\r\nhave left to him his official mantle, but for the early failure of his\r\nhealth; James Dean, whose name is indelibly engraven upon the earlier\r\nperiods of our national history, Jacob Fowler, who well illustrated\r\nthe value of Christian civilization to the Indian; Caleb Bingham and\r\nElisha Ticknor, whose names are closely interwoven with the\r\neducational history of New England's metropolis, Josiah Dunham, Judah\r\nDana, Caleb Butler, William A. Hayes, the intimate and honored friend\r\nof Francis Brown, Joseph Perry, John S. Emerson, and Osgood Johnson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL DEPARTMENT.--PROFESSORS NATHAN SMITH, REUBEN D. MUSSEY, DIXI\r\nCROSBY, EDMUND R. PEASLEE, ALBERT SMITH, AND ALPHEUS B. CROSBY.--OTHER\r\nTEACHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn \"A Contribution to the Medical History of New Hampshire,\" by Prof.\r\nA. B. Crosby, we find a condensed history of the Medical Department of\r\nthe College.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after its formation, the impression became general that the\r\nState Society, excellent as it was both in design and execution, did\r\nnot fully answer the medical wants of New Hampshire. There were those\r\nwho felt that the young men of the State should have systematic,\r\ndidactic instruction, and that this could be accomplished only by the\r\nfoundation of a regularly chartered medical college. This plan was\r\neventually reduced to a demonstration through the energy and talents\r\nof one man. It is with profound veneration that I write the name of\r\nNathan Smith. Himself a member of the society, I know not but he here\r\ngained inspiration and encouragement for the enterprise from his\r\nassociates. At the annual meeting of the Board of Trustees of\r\nDartmouth College, in August, 1796, being then a Bachelor of Medicine,\r\nnot having received the degree of M.D., he made an application to the\r\nBoard, asking their encouragement and approbation of a plan he had\r\ndevised to establish a professorship of the Theory and Practice of\r\nMedicine in connection with Dartmouth College. After considerable\r\ndiscussion, the Board voted to postpone their final action upon the\r\nproposition for a year, but in the meantime a resolution was passed\r\ncomplimentary to the character and energy of Mr. Smith, and promising\r\nsuch encouragement and assistance in the future as the plan might\r\nmerit and the circumstances of the college admit.\r\n\r\n\"The records of the college are extremely barren of details respecting\r\nthe preliminary steps towards a medical establishment, and there are\r\nno means of knowing what the action of the Board was the following\r\nyear. It is evident, however, that some measures must have been taken\r\nin relation to the future welfare of the school, for in the year 1798\r\nwe find that 'the fee for conferring the degree of Bachelor of\r\nMedicine _pro meritis_ be twenty dollars.' The honorary degree of\r\nMaster of Arts was the same year conferred on Mr. Smith, while it\r\nremained for a subsequent Board to discover that his professional\r\nattainments merited the rank and title of Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Later in the same session it was voted 'That a professor be\r\nappointed, whose duty it shall be to deliver public lectures upon\r\nAnatomy, Surgery, Chemistry, Materia Medica, and the Theory and\r\nPractice of Physic, and that said professor be entitled to receive\r\npayment for instruction in those branches, as hereafter mentioned, as\r\ncompensation for his services in that office.' Mr. Smith was at once\r\nchosen to fulfill the laborious, and to us almost incredible duties of\r\nthis professorship, while the compensation alluded to was for a long\r\ntime held in abeyance. We also find that in this year the Board\r\nadopted the following code of Medical Statutes:\r\n\r\n\"1. Lectures shall begin the first of October, annually, and continue\r\nten weeks, during which the professor shall deliver three lectures\r\ndaily, Saturday and Sunday excepted.\r\n\r\n\"2. In the lectures on the Theory and Practice of Physic, shall be\r\nexplained the nature of diseases and method of cure.\r\n\r\n\"3. The lectures on Chemistry and Materia Medica shall be accompanied\r\nby actual experiments, tending to explain and demonstrate the\r\nprinciples of Chemistry, and an exhibition shall be made of the\r\nprincipal medicines used in curing disease, with an explanation of\r\ntheir medicinal qualities, and effect on the human body.\r\n\r\n\"4. In the lectures on Anatomy and Surgery, shall be demonstrated the\r\nparts of the human body by dissecting a recent subject, _if such\r\nsubject can be legally obtained_; otherwise, by exhibiting anatomical\r\npreparations, which shall be attended by the performance of the\r\nprincipal capital operations in surgery. [The lower animals were used\r\nto some extent.]\r\n\r\n\"5. The medical professor shall be entitled to the use of the college\r\nlibrary and apparatus gratis.\r\n\r\n\"6. The medical students shall be entitled to the use of the college\r\nlibrary under the discretionary restrictions of the president.\r\n\r\n\"7. Medical students shall be subject to the same rules of morality\r\nand decorum as Bachelors in Art residing at the college.\r\n\r\n\"8. No graduate of any college shall be admitted to an examination for\r\nthe degree of Bachelor of Medicine, unless he shall have studied two\r\nfull years with some respectable physician, or surgeon, and attended\r\ntwo full courses of lectures at some university.\r\n\r\n\"9. No person _not_ a graduate shall be admitted to such an\r\nexamination unless he shall have studied _three_ full years, as above,\r\nattended two full courses of lectures, and shall, upon a preparatory\r\nexamination before the president and professors, be able to parse the\r\nEnglish and Latin languages, to construe Virgil and Cicero's orations,\r\nand possess a good knowledge of common Arithmetic, Geometry,\r\nGeography, and Natural and Moral Philosophy.\r\n\r\n\"10. Examinations shall be holden in public before the executive\r\nauthority of the college by the medical professor, and candidates\r\nshall read and defend a dissertation, etc.\r\n\r\n\"11. Every person receiving a degree in Medicine shall cause his\r\nthesis to be printed, and sixteen copies thereof to be delivered to\r\nthe president, for the use of the college and Trustees.\r\n\r\n\"12. The fee for attending a full course of lectures shall be fifty\r\ndollars; that is, for Anatomy and Surgery, twenty-five dollars; for\r\nChemistry and Materia Medica, fifteen dollars, and for Theory and\r\nPractice, ten dollars.\r\n\r\n\"13. The members of the two senior classes in college may attend the\r\nmedical lectures by paying twenty dollars for the full course.\r\n\r\n\"Besides these statutes, the Trustees voted that Mr. Smith might\r\nemploy assistance in any of his departments, at _his own expense_,\r\nand that one half part of the fees for conferring the degree of\r\nBachelor of Medicine be his perquisite, and the other half a\r\nperquisite to the president of the college.\r\n\r\n\"The first course of lectures was delivered in the fall of 1797,\r\nalthough Mr. Smith was not elected to his professorship until after\r\nhis return from Europe, the following year. In the year 1798, two\r\nyoung men were graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Medicine. The\r\nnext year the Trustees voted to appropriate a room in the northeast\r\ncorner of Dartmouth Hall to the use of Professor Smith, and it was\r\nrepaired and furnished for that purpose. The room was a small one,\r\nscarcely as large as a common parlor, but still it served for a\r\nlecture hall, dissecting-room, chemical laboratory and library, for\r\nseveral years, when another room adjoining was appropriated to the\r\nsame purpose.\r\n\r\n\"In 1801, the degree of Doctor of Medicine was conferred upon Mr.\r\nSmith, and a committee was appointed to confer with him in relation to\r\na salary. A grant of fifty dollars per annum was voted him, upon which\r\nhe was to allow a debt he owed the college for money loaned. I presume\r\nthat this latter was furnished him in order to enable him to visit\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\"The Trustees about this time made a change in the term of study\r\nrequired for a degree. The new statute fixed the period of three years\r\nfor academical graduates, and five years for non-graduates.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1803 the New Hampshire Legislature granted $600 to Dr. Smith for\r\nthe purchase of apparatus, and in 1809 $3,450 for \"a building of brick\r\nor stone for a medical school, sixty-five feet in length, thirty-two\r\nfeet in width, and two stories in height,\" Dr. Smith furnishing land\r\nfor the purpose. He furnished one acre, on which a brick building\r\nseventy-five feet in length, two stories in the middle, with wings of\r\nthree stories, was erected, at a cost of over $4,600, Dr. Smith\r\nbecoming responsible for the balance. By the terms of the above grants\r\nthe building and anatomical and chemical apparatus became the property\r\nof the State upon the removal of Dr. Smith from the institution, which\r\nis with propriety styled the \"New Hampshire Medical College.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1810 Dr. Cyrus Perkins (created a Doctor upon that occasion) was\r\nelected professor of Anatomy. Some trouble having occurred about this\r\ntime between the college officers and the Medical students, the\r\nfollowing articles were added to the laws.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"'1. That each person, previous to becoming a member of the Medical\r\ninstitution, shall be required to give satisfactory evidence that he\r\npossesses a good moral character.\r\n\r\n\"'2. That it be required of medical students that they conduct\r\nthemselves respectfully towards the executive officers of the college,\r\nand if any of them should be guilty of immoral or ungentlemanly\r\nconduct the executive may expel them, and no professor shall receive\r\nor continue to receive as his private pupil any such expelled person,\r\nor recommend him to any other medical man or institution.\r\n\r\n\"'3. That the executive officers of the college be, and hereby are\r\nauthorized to visit the rooms of the medical students whenever they\r\nthink proper.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1812, some important changes were made in the economy of\r\nthe institution. Up to this time the degree of Bachelor of Medicine\r\nonly was conferred upon recent graduates, while the degree of M.D. was\r\nonly allowed in course three years after graduation. This was now\r\nchanged, and the degree of Doctor of Medicine was conferred upon all\r\nmedical graduates. The term of study was again changed, and fixed at\r\nthe present standard. Another of the new regulations and perhaps the\r\nleast agreeable one to the students, compelled candidates to read\r\ntheir theses publicly in the chapel.\r\n\r\n\"The Faculty was also strengthened by the appointment of Rufus Graves,\r\nEsq., as lecturer on Chemistry, making this department, for the first\r\ntime, a separate branch. Colonel Graves, although a good lecturer, was\r\nan unsuccessful manipulator, which caused his dismission in 1815,\r\nthree years later. During the same year [1812, at Dartmouth] we find\r\nthat Mr. Reuben D. Mussey, a name thoroughly identified with the\r\nsuccess of the school, and with medical progress in New Hampshire, was\r\ncreated a Doctor of Medicine.\r\n\r\n\"In 1814, Dr. Smith having been absent for a year, it was voted that\r\nthe salary and emoluments pertaining to the chair of Medicine, be paid\r\nto Dr. Perkins, and at an adjourned meeting the resignation of Dr.\r\nSmith was received and accepted. The Board then proceeded to elect Dr.\r\nMussey professor of Theory and Practice and Materia Medica. In 1816,\r\nDr. Perkins was excused from lecturing on Surgery, and Obstetrics was\r\nadded to his chair, instead, while Dr. Mussey assumed the department\r\nof Chemistry, in addition to his other labors. In the meanwhile Dr.\r\nSmith was reëlected professor of Surgery, but declining to accept, Dr.\r\nMassey added a course of lectures on this branch to his already\r\nlaborious duties. The following year he was somewhat relieved by the\r\nchoice of Dr. James F. Dana, as lecturer on Chemistry, which office he\r\ncontinued to hold until 1820, when he was elected to a full\r\nprofessorship. In August, 1819, Dr. Perkins resigned his chair.\r\n\r\n\"By vote of the Board of Trustees, in 1820, they accepted the\r\nproffered fraternization of the New Hampshire Medical Society, by\r\nsending delegates to attend the annual examinations. The statutes were\r\nalso altered very materially. By these amendments the Medical Faculty\r\nwere allowed the sole control of the discipline, etc., of their\r\ndepartment. Students coming to attend lectures were not required to\r\ngive evidence of the possession of a good moral character, as under\r\nthe old laws. The invidious have alleged that this latter amendment\r\nenabled a larger number to avail themselves of the advantages of a\r\nmedical education than might otherwise do so. The requirements for\r\ngraduation were at the same time lessened, being now limited to a\r\nknowledge of Latin and Natural and Experimental Philosophy, while the\r\nexaminations were to be private, instead of public, as heretofore.\r\n\r\n\"It was determined that the Medical Faculty should henceforth consist\r\nof:\r\n\r\n\"1. The president of the College.\r\n\r\n\"2. A professor of Surgery, Obstetrics, and Medical Jurisprudence.\r\n\r\n\"3. A professor of Theory and Practice and Materia Medica.\r\n\r\n\"4. A professor of Chemistry and Mineralogy.\r\n\r\n\"5. A professor of Anatomy and Physiology.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Mussey was elected to the first of the professorial chairs; Dr.\r\nDaniel Oliver, of Salem, Mass., to the second; Dr. James F. Dana, to\r\nthe third, and Dr. Usher Parsons to the fourth. Dr. Parsons remained\r\nbut two years, when Dr. Mussey was appointed professor of Anatomy, in\r\naddition to his other branches. No further change occurred until 1826,\r\nwhen Dr. Dana resigned the chair of Chemistry, which was filled by the\r\nelection of Professor Hale, who continued to lecture until 1835, when\r\nhis connection with the college ceased. The following year Dr. John\r\nDelamater was chosen professor of the Theory and Practice of Physic,\r\nand the present incumbent, Dr. O. P. Hubbard, professor of Chemistry,\r\nwhile in 1838 a great change was made in the Medical Faculty by the\r\nresignation of all the lecturers except Professor Hubbard. By the\r\nelection of the Trustees, the Faculty now consisted of Elisha\r\nBartlett, Oliver Wendell Holmes, John Delamater, Oliver Payson\r\nHubbard, Dixi Crosby, and Stephen W. Williams. Dr. Bartlett resigned\r\nin 1840, and was succeeded by Dr. Joseph Roby. Dr. Delamater also\r\nleft, and Dr. Holmes tendered his resignation. The next year, 1841,\r\nDr. Phelps and Dr. Peaslee commenced their long and useful connection\r\nwith the school. No farther change was made until 1849, when Dr. Roby\r\nresigned and Dr. Albert Smith was elected. In 1867 Dixi Crosby\r\nresigned the chair of Surgery, and A. B. Crosby, who had served as\r\nadjunct professor of Surgery since 1862, was elected to fill the\r\nvacancy. In 1869, Dr. Peaslee, having resigned the chair of Anatomy\r\nand Physiology, was transferred to a new chair of the Diseases of\r\nWomen, while Lyman Bartlett How, M.D., was elected to fill the\r\nvacancy. And finally Dr. Dixi Crosby has sent in his resignation of\r\nthe chair of Obstetrics, to take effect at the ensuing commencement\r\n(1870), thus terminating an active connection of thirty-two years with\r\nthe school.\r\n\r\n\"Nathan Smith, the founder of the school, was without dispute a great\r\nman. He was born at Rehoboth, Massachusetts, September 30, 1762.\r\nIncited to enter the profession by witnessing an amputation in\r\nVermont, he devoted himself to acquiring the best preliminary\r\neducation his means afforded, and eventually entered his profession\r\nfull of zeal and ambition, resolved to act no secondary part in his\r\nchosen vocation. To found a medical college at Dartmouth was the chief\r\ndesire of his early manhood. Regardless of his own pecuniary\r\ninterests, he borrowed money to buy the necessary apparatus and\r\nappliances with which to commence his course of instruction. When the\r\nincreasing demands of the institution required a building for its\r\naccommodation, it was through his personal efforts that it was\r\nsecured. The means were raised and the project carried out by Dr.\r\nSmith, who, himself, on his own responsibility, furnished a large part\r\nof the money. A part, as shown by the records, was also secured by the\r\nsame gentleman from the Legislature of New Hampshire.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Smith was a man of genius. I hazard nothing in saying that he was\r\nfifty years in advance of his profession. He was one of those\r\ncharacters who was not only an observing man, but, rarest of all, he\r\nwas a _good observer_. Nothing escaped him, and when he had seized on\r\nall the salient points of a given subject, he astounded his listeners\r\nwith the full, symmetrical character of his generalizations.\r\n\r\n\"As intances in point, let me briefly advert to one or two\r\nillustrations. When Dr. Smith entered the profession, everything in\r\nthe way of continued fever in the valley of the Connecticut was termed\r\ntyphus. Dr. S. soon became convinced that while true typhus did\r\nprevail, there was yet a continued fever essentially different in its\r\ncharacter, and so he came to differentiate between typhus and typhoid.\r\nNoting carefully the symptoms in these cases, making autopsies\r\nwhenever a chance occurred, and observing the morbid changes thus\r\nrevealed, he soon found himself master of the situation. Then he wrote\r\nan unpretending little tract, in which he embodied his observations\r\nand his inferences. This brochure was undoubtedly the first\r\ncomprehensive description of typhoid fever written, and covered in a\r\nwonderfully exhaustive way not only the clinical history, but the\r\npathology, of this most interesting disease. This noble record of\r\nresults, obtained by observations made mainly at Norwich, Vermont, and\r\nCornish, New Hampshire, was almost the '_Vox clamantis in deserto_.'\r\n\r\n\"Many years later, in the great hospitals of Paris, Louis made and\r\npublished his own observations in regard to the same disease, and the\r\nwhole medical world rang with plaudits of admiration at his genius and\r\nlearning. But in the modest little tract of Nathan Smith, the gist and\r\ngerm of all the magnificent discoveries of Louis are anticipated. And\r\nthus it is again demonstrated that men of genius are confined to no\r\nage and to no country, but whether in the wilds of New Hampshire or in\r\nthe world's gayest capital, they form a fraternity as cosmopolitan as\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\n\"I have recently learned an incident that still further illustrates\r\nDr. Smith's sagacity. While residing in Cornish he had a friend who\r\nwas a sea-captain, and who, on his return from foreign voyages, was\r\nwont to relate to him whatever of interest in a medical way he might\r\nhave chanced to observe while abroad. On one occasion he told Dr.\r\nSmith that on his previous voyage one of the sailors dislocated his\r\nhip; there being no surgeon on board, the captain tried but in vain to\r\nreduce it. The man was accordingly placed in a hammock with the\r\ndislocation unreduced. During a great storm the sufferer was thrown\r\nfrom the hammock to the floor, striking violently on the knee of the\r\naffected side. On examination, it was found that in the fall the hip\r\nhad somehow been set. This greatly interested Dr. Smith, and he\r\nquestioned the narrator again and again as to the exact position of\r\nthe thigh, the knee and the leg, at the time of the fall.\r\n\r\n\"From this apparently insignificant circumstance, Dr. Smith eventually\r\neduced and reduced to successful practice the method of reducing\r\ndislocations by the manoeuvre, a system as useful as it is simple,\r\nand as scientific as the principle of flexion and leverage on which it\r\ndepends. Had this incident been related to a stupid man, he would have\r\nseen nothing in it, or to a skeptic, he would have discredited the\r\nwhole account, but to a man of genius it furnished a clue by which\r\nanother of Nature's labyrinths was traced out. This system is by far\r\nthe best ever devised, symplifying and rendering easy the work of the\r\nsurgeon, while reducing human suffering to its minimum.\r\n\r\n\"I do not propose to recall to your minds how much he did for\r\nMedicine and Surgery; that were the work of days, not a single hour.\r\n\r\n\"Time would fail me to relate the well authenticated traditions of his\r\nskill, his benevolence and his practical greatness. But almost from\r\nthe inception of his professional life until he left for New Haven, he\r\nwas the acknowledged leader of his profession in the State, and his\r\nreputation came soon to cover the whole of New England. He was the\r\nfather of several sons, who have since been distinguished in the same\r\nprofession. The venerable Professor N. R. Smith, of Baltimore, is the\r\neldest, and perhaps the most celebrated, of the survivors.\"\r\n\r\nThe venerable Dr. A. T. Lowe adds the following valuable paragraphs:\r\n\r\n\"In the organization and early history of the Medical department of\r\nDartmouth College Dr. Nathan Smith occupied a preëminent position. For\r\nten or twelve years he was the actual manager and the only professor\r\nin the institution, giving three lectures each day, for five days in\r\nthe week, through the term of ten to twelve weeks. He lectured with\r\ngreat acceptance in all the branches of the profession then taught in\r\nthe few kindred institutions existing in the country, and he\r\ncontributed liberally to the pecuniary support of the institution,\r\nfrequently to his great personal inconvenience. With these accumulated\r\nduties to discharge, he faithfully attended to a large practice in\r\nMedicine and Surgery, which was daily increasing, and severely tasking\r\nhis physical as well as his intellectual powers, and his fame, in the\r\nline of his profession, soon placed him at its head; and his skill and\r\nthe history of his remarkable success, so frequently announced, and so\r\nwell attested, was early recognized and acknowledged, not only\r\nthroughout his State, but was scarcely limited to New England. By a\r\nseeming universal consent Dr. Smith's name stood among the highest in\r\nthe medical temple of fame.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Smith was not what the world would now call a learned man. We may\r\nsay of him, in this respect, what Ben Jonson said of Shakespeare: 'He\r\nknew little Latin and less Greek,' but he had a mind and a power of\r\nintellect which as eminently fitted him for a physician, as\r\nShakespeare's genius qualified him to become a dramatist of the\r\nhighest character; and whatever the occasion, whether it related to\r\nthe lecturer or teacher, to the surgeon or physician, Dr. Smith could\r\nreadily exercise his whole moral force for the enlightenment of his\r\npupil, or the health of his patient.\r\n\r\n\"The writer of these lines became his pupil in 1816; attending him\r\nalmost daily in his professional visits, to witness his practice and\r\nlisten to his clinical instruction.\"\r\n\r\nAfter giving one or two instances of his quick diagnostic ability and\r\nhis highly successful practice, he continues:\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Smith was a great and good man. He never appeared to toil for\r\nprofessional fame, but to do good to his fellow-man: and in view of\r\nhis virtues as a citizen and his justly preëminent skill as a\r\nphysician, one of his surviving pupils of those early days, who now\r\ncounts more than four-score years, feels impelled to exclaim,--Honored\r\nbe the memory of Nathan Smith, the founder, father, and for many years\r\nthe sustainer of the Medical Department of Dartmouth College; ever\r\nrecognized by all his friends and acquaintances--and their name was\r\nlegion--as an honest man and most useful citizen.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Smith married successively, Elizabeth and Sarah, daughters\r\nof Gen. Jonathan Chase, of Cornish, N. H. He died at New Haven, Conn.,\r\nwhere he had been some years a professor in the Medical Department of\r\nYale College, January 26, 1829.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA commemorative \"Address,\" by Professor A. B. Crosby, contains the\r\nfollowing account of Professor Smith's successor:\r\n\r\n\"Reuben Dimond Mussey was born in Pelham, N. H., June 23, 1780. His\r\nfather, Dr. John Mussey, was a respectable physician and an excellent\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"Determined to have an education, although too poor to immediately\r\nattain it, he labored on a farm in summer and taught a school during\r\nthe winter. This he continued to do until, at the age of twenty-one,\r\nhe entered the Junior class in Dartmouth College, in the year 1801. He\r\ncontinued to teach for his support while in college, and acquitted\r\nhimself creditably as a scholar, being reckoned in the first third of\r\nhis class.\r\n\r\n\"He was graduated in August, 1803, and immediately became a pupil of\r\nDr. Nathan Smith, the founder of Dartmouth Medical College. The\r\nfollowing summer young Mussey taught an academy at Peterborough, and\r\nstudied with Dr. Howe of Jaffrey.\r\n\r\n\"He completed his studies with Dr. Smith, sustained a public\r\nexamination, and read and defended a thesis on Dysentery. The degree\r\nof Bachelor of Medicine having been conferred upon him in 1806, he\r\ncommenced practice in Ipswich, now Essex, Mass. Here he practiced\r\nsuccessfully for three years, when he settled his business and went to\r\nPhiladelphia, where he engaged in medical study for a period of nine\r\nmonths. While at Chebacco, now Essex, Mass., he married Miss Mary\r\nSewall, who survived the marriage only three years. He subsequently\r\nmarried Miss Hetty Osgood, a daughter of Dr. Osgood of Salem, who\r\nserved as a surgeon in the army during the Revolution. Under the\r\ninstruction of Benjamin Smith Barton, he attended a full course of\r\nlectures in the University of Pennsylvania, and was graduated as a\r\nDoctor in Medicine in the year 1809. The professors at that time were\r\nRush, Wistar, Physic, Dorsey, Barton, and Woodhouse.\r\n\r\n\"Drs. Chapman and James gave the course in Obstetrics. Dr. Mussey here\r\ndistinguished himself by a series of experiments tending to rebut some\r\nof the generally received physiological doctrines of the time.\r\n\r\n\"On his return from Philadelphia he settled in Salem, Mass., and soon\r\nafterward formed a partnership with Dr. Daniel Oliver, subsequently a\r\nprofessor in the Dartmouth Medical College.\r\n\r\n\"These gentlemen gave popular courses of lectures on Chemistry, in\r\nSalem, with great acceptance. Dr. Mussey remained in this field\r\nbetween five and six years, and attained a large practice during the\r\nlast three years, averaging, it is said, a fraction over three\r\nobstetric cases a week. He had already distinguished himself as a\r\nsurgeon, and in the autumn of 1814 he was called to the chair of\r\nTheory and Practice at Dartmouth. He gave in addition a course on\r\nChemistry, most acceptably to the students, and engaged in an extended\r\nand a laborious practice.\r\n\r\n\"In 1822, Dr. Mussey was appointed professor of Anatomy and Surgery.\r\nUntil the close of the session of 1838, he held this chair, and also\r\nlectured on Materia Medica and Obstetrics, to meet occasional\r\nexigencies in the college.\r\n\r\n\"In the summer of 1818 he lectured on Chemistry in the college at\r\nMiddlebury, Vt. In December, 1829, Dr. Mussey left Hanover for Paris,\r\nwhere he remained several months. He passed several weeks in London,\r\nvisited the great hospitals and museums, both there and in the\r\nprovinces, and became acquainted with many distinguished men.\r\n\r\n\"Not far from this time he was invited to fill the chair of Anatomy\r\nand Surgery at Bowdoin College, which he did for four years in\r\nsuccession. In 1836 and 1837, Dr. Mussey went to Fairfield, New York,\r\nand gave lectures on surgery at the Medical College in that place.\r\nDuring the year 1837 a professorship was tendered him in New York\r\ncity, Cincinnati, and Nashville, Tennessee. He decided to accept the\r\ncall to Cincinnati, and for fourteen years was the leading man in the\r\nOhio Medical College. He then founded the Miami Medical College,\r\nlabored assiduously for its good six years, and then retired from\r\nactive professional life, though still retaining all his ardor and\r\nenthusiasm for his chosen profession. At the close of his professorial\r\nduties in 1858, Dr. Mussey removed to Boston, where he spent the\r\nremainder of his life, and died from the infirmities of age, June 21,\r\n1866.\r\n\r\n\"He had ever been from his youth a consistent, devout Christian, and\r\nhis record is without spot or blemish.\r\n\r\n\"It was as a surgeon that Dr. Mussey came to be most extensively\r\nknown. Both as an operative and a scientific surgeon he attained a\r\nnational reputation.\r\n\r\n\"He cared not to make a figure, but to benefit his patient; not to\r\ngain _éclat_, but to save human life. He believed much in skilled\r\nsurgery, something in nature, but most of all in God. So it transpired\r\nthat on the eve of a great operation he frequently knelt at the\r\nbedside, and sought skill and strength and success from the great\r\nSource of all vitality. We are told that the moral effect upon the\r\npatient, and the peaceful composure that followed, were not the least\r\nof the agencies that so often rendered his surgery successful.\r\n\r\n\"But he was not content blindly to accept the dictum of those who had\r\ngone before. Every principle was carefully scrutinized, and whatever\r\nhe believed to be false he did not hesitate to attack, and so his name\r\ncame to be associated with surgical progress. As illustrative of this\r\npoint, some instances may be adduced.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1830, and before that period, Sir Astley Cooper had\r\ntaught the doctrine of non-union in cases of intra-capsular fracture,\r\nand it was generally accepted as an established principle at that\r\ntime. Dr. Mussey carried a specimen to England which he believed\r\nshowed the possibility of such union taking place. Sir Astley on first\r\nseeing it said, \"This was never broken,\" but on seeing a section of\r\nthe same specimen remarked, 'This does look a little more like it, to\r\nbe sure, but I do not think the fracture was entirely within the\r\ncapsular ligament.' John Thompson of Edinburgh, on seeing it, declared\r\n'upon his troth and honor' that it had never been broken. This eminent\r\nsurgeon, like the disputatious Massachusetts Scotchman, 'always\r\npositive and sometimes right,' was in this instance mistaken, as the\r\nprinciple advocated by Dr. Mussey is now established.\r\n\r\n\"As a surgeon he was bold and fearless, ever willing to assume any\r\nlegitimate responsibility, even though it took him into the\r\nundiscovered country of experiment. He did not do this rashly, but\r\nonly when the stake was worthy of the risk. There is still living in\r\nHanover a monument of Dr. Mussey's pluck and skill. This man had a\r\nlarge, ulcerated and bleeding nævus on the vertex of his head, which\r\nthreatened a speedy death. There seemed no way to relieve the patient\r\nexcept by tying both carotids, which was regarded as an operation\r\ninevitably fatal. The danger was imminent, and as Dr. Mussey could see\r\nno way to untie the knot, he determined to cut it. He tied one\r\ncarotid, and in twelve days tied the other, following both operations\r\nin a few weeks with a removal of the tumor. The recovery was perfect,\r\nand the case was, we believe, the first recorded instance where both\r\ncarotids were successfully tied. This operation gave him great fame\r\nboth at home and abroad.\r\n\r\n\"It is not my purpose to attempt an account of the surgery done by\r\nthis eminent man, only to touch on some of its salient points. Thus he\r\nsuccessfully removed an ovarian tumor, at a time when the operation\r\nhad been done only a few times in the world. He removed a boy's tongue\r\nwhich measured eight inches in circumference, and projected five\r\ninches beyond the jaws, and the patient recovered.\r\n\r\n\"He removed the scapula and a large part of the clavicle at one\r\noperation, from a patient on whom he had amputated previously at the\r\nshoulder-joint. Dr. Mussey supposed that this was the first operation\r\nof the kind [as it was in some respects] in the history of Surgery.\r\n\r\n\"He several times removed the upper, and portions of the lower, jaw.\r\nDr. Mussey kept no extended records of his operations, but I subjoin a\r\nfew statements alike interesting to us and creditable to him.\r\n\r\n\"He performed the operation of lithotomy forty-nine times, and all the\r\npatients recovered but four. He operated for strangulated hernia forty\r\ntimes, and with a fatal result in only eight cases. He practiced\r\nsubcutaneous deligation in forty cases of varicocele, and all were\r\nsuccessful. Dr. Mussey operated four times for perineal fistula, twice\r\nfor impermeable stricture of the urethra, and did a large number of\r\nplastic operations with the best results. He also successfully treated\r\na recto-vaginal fistula.\r\n\r\n\"These are only a fraction of the innumerable operations which he did,\r\nyet they show results such as the greatest surgeons in the world would\r\nbe proud to declare.\r\n\r\n\"But it is not alone as a surgeon that Dr. Mussey attained excellence.\r\nIt was as an accurate observer that he early made himself known to the\r\nmedical world. The habit of his mind was positive; he respected\r\nauthority, and to the latest period of his life was assiduous in\r\nacquiring professional knowledge from books no less than from\r\nobservation. He delighted to fortify himself in any given position by\r\nciting authorities, and always showed that he had informed himself\r\nexhaustively in the bibliography of the subject. Yet it was his habit\r\nto subject every medical statement to the most rigid tests. While\r\npursuing his studies in Philadelphia, he joined issue with Dr. Rush on\r\nsome of the physiological doctrines which were generally received at\r\nthat time. This distinguished man had taught the doctrine of\r\nnon-absorption by the skin. This was supposed to have been proved by\r\nan experiment in which a young man, confined in a small room, breathed\r\nthrough a tube running through the wall into the open air, the surface\r\nof the skin being rubbed at the same time with turpentine, asparagus,\r\netc. As no odor of these substances was perceptible in the secretions,\r\nit was inferred that no absorption had taken place through the skin,\r\nand that it was impossible. Dr. Mussey, believing this doctrine to be\r\nfallacious, immersed himself in a strong solution of madder for three\r\nhours. He had the satisfaction of getting unmistakable evidence of the\r\npresence of madder in the secretions for two days, the addition of an\r\nalkali always rendering them red. He repeated this experiment with the\r\nsame result, and made it the theme of a thesis on his graduation. Some\r\nof the Faculty who differed with Dr. Rush on the subject were much\r\npleased with these experiments, and predicted even then for our friend\r\na distinguished career.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Mussey died at Boston June 21, 1866.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe quote from Dr. J. W. Barstow's obituary notice in the \"New York\r\nMedical Journal,\" November, 1873, of Professor Mussey's successor.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Dixi Crosby, for thirty-two years professor of Surgery in\r\nDartmouth College, died at his residence in Hanover, N. H., September\r\n26, 1873. Dr. Crosby was born February 7, 1800, at Sandwich, N. H., of\r\npure New England stock,--strong in the best Puritan element, where\r\nself-reliance, love of justice, and unbending will, formed the basis\r\nof character and the mainspring of action. His father's father was a\r\ncaptain in the Revolutionary army, and served with two of his sons at\r\nthe battle of Bunker Hill. His maternal grandfather (Hoit) was one of\r\nWashington's body-guard, and later in life a judge of some\r\ndistinction. His father, Dr. Asa Crosby, who married Betsey Hoit, was\r\na surgeon of eminence in eastern New Hampshire. At the age of twenty,\r\nhe entered upon the study of Medicine in the office of his father.\r\n\r\n\"The practice of a country doctor in New Hampshire of course embraced\r\nevery department and variety of professional work. But Surgery offered\r\nto young Crosby a special charm, and the ardor with which he threw\r\nhimself into this branch of the profession showed early fruits. From\r\nthe day when he commenced his Anatomy, his practice and his study went\r\nhand in hand. Fearless and original, ready in expedients and ingenious\r\nin their use, he observed, he resolved, and he acted.\r\n\r\n\"In the first year of his study he accompanied his father to a\r\nconsultation in the case of a man whose leg had been frozen, and whose\r\ncondition was most critical. It was agreed by the older physicians\r\nthat amputation at an earlier stage might have saved the patient's\r\nlife, but that it was now too late to attempt it. Young Crosby urged\r\nthat the operation be performed, but the elders shook their heads. He\r\neven proposed to attempt it himself; but this was received with a\r\nstorm of disapproval, in which even his father joined, and the thing\r\nwas pronounced impossible. The doctors then departed, leaving the\r\nstudent to watch with the patient during the few hours which\r\napparently remained of life. During the night young Crosby succeeded\r\nin reviving the courage of the man to make a last effort for life. The\r\nlimb was removed, and the man recovered.\r\n\r\n\"His second year of study developed still further the growing\r\nresources of the young surgeon. Upon one occasion both father and son,\r\nwhile visiting a patient at night, in a distant village, were suddenly\r\ncalled to a case of extensive laceration of the leg, with profuse\r\nhemorrhage. The case was urgent, and the patient was sinking. No\r\ninstruments were at hand. He called for a carving-knife, which he\r\nsharpened on a grindstone and finished on a razor-strap, filed a\r\nhand-saw, amputated the limb, dressed the stump, left the patient in\r\nsafety, and drove home with his father to breakfast. The man\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\n\"Before a nature so fearless, and so fertile in expedients, obstacles\r\nspeedily vanish, and young Crosby found himself in possession of a\r\nlarge and responsible practice, even before taking his medical degree,\r\nand at the early age of twenty-three years. The following year (1824)\r\nhe graduated in Medicine at Dartmouth (having passed his examination\r\nin November preceding), and for ten years remained in Gilmanton, in\r\npractice with his father. He then removed to Meredith Bridge, now\r\nLaconia, N. H., where he practiced for three years; and in 1838 was\r\ncalled to the chair of Surgery in Dartmouth College, then recently\r\nmade vacant by the resignation of the late Dr. Mussey. In this field\r\nDr. Crosby found at once full exercise for all his large resources of\r\nhead and heart and hand. As an instructor he was clear, direct, and\r\ndefinite,--imparting, to his pupils his own zeal, and teaching them\r\nhis own self-reliance. 'Depend upon yourselves, young gentlemen,' he\r\ninvariably said. 'Take no man's diagnosis, but see with your own eyes,\r\nfeel with your own fingers, judge with your own judgment, and be the\r\ndisciple of no man.'\r\n\r\n\"In his class, he was courteous without familiarity, patient with\r\ndulness, but quick to punish impertinence; always kind, always\r\ndignified, always genial. The practical view of a subject was the view\r\nwhich he delighted to take; and the dry humor with which he never\r\nfailed to emphasize his point, at once fixed it in the memory of the\r\nclass, and made it available for future use. With his office-students,\r\nDr. Crosby was the very soul of geniality and confidence. He saw and\r\nmeasured men at a glance, and was rarely wrong in his estimate of\r\ncharacter. Strong in his own convictions, he was yet tender of the\r\ninfirmities and the prejudices of others, and his generous instincts\r\nlost no opportunity for their daily exercise.\r\n\r\n\"His love of nature was as instinctive and as thorough as his\r\nknowledge of men. He transferred the treasures of the woods to his own\r\ngarden. He studied the habits of birds and insects, and his parlors\r\nwere adorned with a cabinet of American birds more complete than is\r\noften found in the museum of a professed naturalist. He reveled in the\r\n'pomp of groves and garniture of fields,' and his daily drives through\r\nthe picturesque scenery of the Connecticut valley fed his æsthetic\r\ntaste, and proved a compensation for fatigue.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Crosby, though a surgeon by nature and by preference, was in no\r\nmodern sense a _specialist_. His professional labors covered the whole\r\nrange of Medicine. His professorship included Obstetrics as well as\r\nSurgery, and his practice in this department was exceptionally large.\r\nHis surgical diocese extended from Lake Champlain to Boston. Distance\r\nseemed no bar to his influence, and his professional journeys were\r\noften made by night as well as by day. Of the special operations of\r\nDr. Crosby we do not propose here to speak in detail. It is sufficient\r\nto mention that, in 1824, he devised a new and ingenious mode of\r\nreducing metacarpo-phalangeal dislocation. In 1836 he removed the arm,\r\nscapula, and three quarters of the clavicle at a single operation, for\r\nthe first time in the history of Surgery. He was the first to open\r\nabscess of the hip-joint. He performed his operations, without ever\r\nhaving seen them performed, almost without exception. Dr. Crosby was\r\nnot what may be called a _rapid_ operator. 'An operation, gentlemen,'\r\nhe often said to his clinical students, 'is soon enough done when it\r\nis _well_ enough done.' And, with him, it was never done otherwise\r\nthan _well_.\r\n\r\n\"At the outbreak of the rebellion, Dr. Crosby served in the\r\nprovost-marshal's office at a great sacrifice for many months,\r\nattending to his practice chiefly at night. As years and honors\r\naccumulated, Dr. Crosby still continued his work, though his\r\nconstitutional vigor was impaired by the severity of the New Hampshire\r\nwinters, and by his unremitting labor. At length, having reached man's\r\nlimit of three-score years and ten, he withdrew from active practice,\r\nand in 1870 resigned his chair in the college, to which his son\r\nsucceeded. From that time it was plain that Dr. Crosby's life-work was\r\nnearly done. In his well-ordered and delightful home he found that\r\nrest to which his long service in behalf of humanity entitled him. His\r\nend was perfect dignity and perfect peace.\r\n\r\n\"To those of us who had been most intimately associated with our\r\ndeparted friend, who had enjoyed his teachings, his counsels, and his\r\ngenerous kindness, the news of his death came as a heavy shock. But he\r\nstill lives in the remembrance of his distinguished services, in the\r\nunfading affection and gratitude of his pupils, and in the many hearts\r\nwhose burdens he has lifted. Verily, '_Extinctus amabitur idem!_'\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Crosby married Mary Jane, daughter of Stephen Moody, of\r\nGilmanton, N. H.\r\n\r\nThe following paragraphs relating to one of Dartmouth's most eminent\r\nprofessors, the esteemed classmate of President Bartlett, who says:\r\n\"Outside of my own family circle, I had no better friend,\" are from\r\nthe pen of Dr. T. A. Emmet, of New York.\r\n\r\n\"Edmund Randolph Peaslee was born at Newton, New Hampshire, January\r\n22, 1814. We have no record of his boyhood, or of his life previous to\r\ngraduating from Dartmouth College, with the class of 1836. In this\r\ninstitution he occupied the position of tutor from 1837 to 1839, when\r\nhe entered the Medical Department of Yale College and took his degree\r\nin 1840.\r\n\r\n\"The following year he settled in Hanover, N. H., and commenced the\r\npractice of his profession. Without waiting in expectation, he began\r\nhis busy life by delivering a popular course of lectures on Anatomy\r\nand Physiology.\r\n\r\n\"These lectures indicated so clearly his talents that, in 1842, but\r\ntwo years after entering the profession, he was appointed professor of\r\nAnatomy and Physiology in the Medical Department of Dartmouth College,\r\nand retained the office until his death. Within a year afterwards, in\r\n1843, he was appointed lecturer, and shortly afterwards professor of\r\nAnatomy and Surgery in the Medical School in Maine, connected with\r\nBowdoin College. He filled those two professorships until 1857, when\r\nhe gave up Anatomy, but continued to lecture on Surgery until 1860.\r\nDr. Peaslee first came to the city of New York in 1851, on receiving\r\nthe professorship of Physiology and General Pathology in the New York\r\nMedical College, then just being established.\r\n\r\n\"This position he held for four years, when he was transferred to the\r\nchair of Obstetrics, and continued to lecture on this branch until the\r\ninstitution was closed about 1860. He, however, did not settle in New\r\nYork, to the practice of his profession, until 1858. After 1860, he\r\nmainly devoted himself to his practice, lecturing little except during\r\nthe summer or autumn course in Dartmouth College. But to do justice to\r\nhis subject and compress the whole subject into the space of some six\r\nweeks, this being his time of recreation from business, he always\r\ndelivered at least two lectures a day and frequently more. In 1870,\r\nhe was elected one of the Trustees of his Alma Mater, which had in\r\n1859 conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Laws. From 1872, he\r\ndelivered a course of lectures in the Medical Department on the\r\nDiseases of Women. Two years afterwards, the course on Obstetrics and\r\nthe Diseases of Women in the Bellevue Hospital Medical College was\r\ndivided, when Dr. Peaslee was offered and accepted the chair of\r\nGynæcology. At about this date he also occupied for a short time a\r\nprofessorship in the Albany Medical School. On the reorganization of\r\nthe Medical Department of the Woman's Hospital of the State of New\r\nYork, in 1872, he was made one of the Attending Surgeons, and held\r\nthis position, together with his professorship in the Bellevue\r\nHospital Medical College, at the time of his death.\r\n\r\n\"In 1857, he published in Philadelphia, 'Human Histology, in its\r\nRelations to Descriptive Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathology,' in which\r\nwere given for the first time, by translation, the experiments of\r\nRobin and Verdell on Anatomical Chemistry. But the one great work\r\nwhich will identify him with his generation is that on 'Ovarian\r\nTumors, their Pathology, Diagnosis, and Treatment, especially by\r\nOvariotomy,' published in New York, 1872. To this work he contributed\r\nbut little original matter, beyond his personal experience, which had\r\nbeen large at that time. He, however, presented a digest of the whole\r\nsubject in so thorough and masterly a manner that this work is\r\ndestined to be a classic and a landmark as it were. It will be the\r\nfuture starting-point for the literature of this subject, as an\r\noriginal patent is in the searching of a title. There will be no need\r\nto go beyond his researches on this subject, as they are exhaustive.\r\n\r\n\"For one feature in his work he has often expressed the greatest\r\nsatisfaction, that he had been able to establish for Dr. Ephraim\r\nMcDowell the credit of being the first ovariotomist. In consequence of\r\nhis labors, the world has at length given us credit for this great\r\ndiscovery, of no less value than many others which we can claim to\r\nhave originated in our country, for the prolongation of life and for\r\nthe mitigation of suffering.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Peaslee, at some time in his life, had lectured on every branch\r\nof Medical science. With the exception of Dr. Physic, we have not\r\nanother instance where the lecturer was equally proficient in the\r\npractice. But if we compare the extent of professional knowledge in\r\nDr. Physic's generation and the acquirements of the present day, Dr.\r\nPeaslee will stand alone. Notwithstanding the incessant claims of his\r\nprofession, he kept up through life his collegiate training in the\r\nclassics, his taste for mathematics, and had acquired the knowledge of\r\none or more modern languages. Few men in the profession were more\r\nfamiliar with the literature of our own language.\"\r\n\r\nDr. W. M. Chamberlain, who had rare opportunities for appreciating the\r\ncharacter and worth of Dr. Peaslee, says:\r\n\r\n\"The call for a sketch of Dr. Peaslee's professional life and work\r\nwill be abundantly satisfied by the recorded tributes of his more\r\nimmediate colleagues and associates, Drs. Barker, Thomas, Emmet,\r\nFlint, and others. These are but a part of the testimony which after\r\nhis death came from far and near. Wherever men were gathered for the\r\nstudy and discussion of medical subjects it was felt that a fountain\r\nof knowledge was closed, a leader of opinion was gone, and they made\r\nhaste to acknowledge their obligations and their loss. He was a member\r\nof many such organizations, and almost uniformly advanced to the front\r\nrank in position.\r\n\r\n\"President of the New Hampshire Medical Society; of the New York\r\nCounty Medical Society; the American Gynæcological Society; the New\r\nYork Academy of Medicine; the New York Pathological Society; the New\r\nYork Obstetrical Society; the New York Medical Journal Association,\r\netc., etc., he reaped all the honors. Yet no one ever thought of him\r\nas a seeker of office. The tribute was always spontaneous, necessary:\r\n'Palmam qui meruit ferat!'\r\n\r\n\"And these honors were not awarded for any great effort or success in\r\nsome partial field. He was decorated for service in each specific\r\nline, as Physician, Surgeon, Pathologist, Gynæcologist, Bibliographer.\r\nHis attainments were comprehensive and symmetrical.\r\n\r\n\"He had the very great advantage of a liberal general education. This\r\ngave him his broad outlook upon all departments of science. He had by\r\nnature a mathematical and logical habit of mind. This made him the\r\naccurate and complete student that he was, both in original\r\ninvestigations and literary research. At the outset of his career he\r\nsought the best schools. Just then (1840) reigned a new enthusiasm in\r\nthe physical and experimental study of the Medical Sciences at Paris.\r\nLaennec, Andral, Louis, Malgaigne, Velpeau, and Bernard, were the\r\nworthy models and masters of the young American.\r\n\r\n\"Thus well-endowed, well-grounded, and well-guided, he entered upon a\r\nlife of professional study, which he pursued with unremitting ardor\r\nand diligence even to the end of life.\r\n\r\n\"It would seem to be a great thing to say of any man that he was never\r\nidle, and never unprofitably employed; but it might be more justly\r\nsaid of Dr. Peaslee than of any other person known to the writer. He\r\nwasted no work. His conclusions were not reached by intuition or\r\nguess, but slowly and surely elaborated, exactly formulated and\r\nclassified, so as to be always at his command.\r\n\r\n\"More than any other member of the profession known to the writer did\r\nhe illustrate each clause of Bacon's category, that 'Reading maketh\r\nthe full man; writing the exact man; and conversation the ready man.'\r\n\r\n\"From the first he was an agreeable and satisfactory teacher, year by\r\nyear, increasingly so; this work he did for thirty-six years; in six\r\nMedical Colleges, in five different departments of the curriculum,\r\nbefore nearly a hundred different classes of students. Such training,\r\nsuch practice, made him a teacher in every professional circle. In\r\nsocieties he was wont to be a silent and often apparently an\r\nabstracted listener until near the close of the debate; then he would\r\nrise and review the whole subject with a memory so comprehensive, a\r\nknowledge so complete, and an appreciation so judicial, that nothing\r\nmore remained to be said. His books and monographs for the time and\r\nera of their publication were standard, and will always remain\r\nexceptionally valuable. Only the lapse of many years may antiquate but\r\nnever stale his elegant work on 'Ovarian Tumors,' of which one of his\r\nmost famous compeers has said that he would 'rather have written it\r\nthan any other medical work of any time or in any language.'\r\n\r\n\"In his personal relations to the members of the profession, Dr.\r\nPeaslee was genial, charitable, and just. His patients looked to him\r\nin perfect confidence and respect, personally as well as\r\nprofessionally. He was as remarkable for the diligent care as for the\r\nthorough study of his cases; and at every visit he dispensed with\r\ngentle humor the best medicines, faith and hope.\r\n\r\n\"From youth through middle life he passed in the light of growing\r\nknowledge; in the serenity of accomplished duty; in the prestige of\r\ngathering fame and fortune; and he died before age or decay had\r\nlimited his scope of life.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Peaslee married Martha Thankful, daughter of Hon. Stephen\r\nKendrick, of Lebanon, N. H. He died in New York City, January 21,\r\n1878.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReliable sources furnish some facts regarding another gentleman long\r\nand honorably connected with this Department.\r\n\r\nProf. Albert Smith, M.D., LL. D., was born in Peterborough, N. H. He\r\ngraduated at Dartmouth College, in 1825, and took his medical degree\r\nthere, in 1833. He was early successful as a practitioner, and before\r\nmiddle age acquired a high reputation as a medical scholar and\r\nthinker.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, he was appointed professor of Materia Medica and Therapeutics\r\nin the Dartmouth Medical College, where he continued to lecture till\r\nhis resignation, in 1870, from which time until his death he was\r\nprofessor Emeritus. In 1857, he delivered his course of lectures at\r\nthe Vermont Medical College, and also the course at the Bowdoin\r\nMedical School, in 1859.\r\n\r\nThe honorary degree of LL. D. was conferred on him by Dartmouth\r\nCollege, in 1870, and also an honorary degree of M.D. by the Rush\r\nMedical College, Chicago, in 1875. He was also an honorary member of\r\nthe New York Medical Society. As a medical instructor he was included\r\nin the first rank of New England professors. His writings also gained\r\nhim a wide and enviable reputation. Among his publications were a\r\nlecture on Hippocrates; also one on Paracelsus, and a commemorative\r\nDiscourse on the death of Dr. Amos Twitchell, besides various articles\r\nin the medical journals and in the transactions of the New Hampshire\r\nMedical Society.\r\n\r\nWith high professional attainments and distinctions Prof. Smith united\r\na personal character of the highest purity, integrity, and nobility.\r\nHe had been for a long time a member and constant attendant upon the\r\nUnitarian Church, and for thirty years a Sunday-school teacher. He was\r\na strong advocate of temperance, and took a deep interest in the cause\r\nof education. He represented Peterborough, his place of residence, in\r\nthe Legislature several times. He devoted the spare hours of his\r\nlatest years to the preparation of a \"History of the Town of\r\nPeterborough,\" which was published in a large octavo volume in 1876.\r\nHe married Fidelia Stearns, February 26, 1828. Prof. Smith died at\r\nPeterborough, February 22, 1878.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following paragraphs relating to one of Dartmouth's most largely\r\nendowed, highly cultivated, and warmly beloved teachers, Prof. Alpheus\r\nB. Crosby, who was born at Gilmanton, N. H., February 22, 1832, and\r\nwas the son of Dr. Dixi and Mary Jane (Moody) Crosby, are from a\r\nMemorial \"Discourse\" by Dr. J. W. Barstow:\r\n\r\n\"Seven generations of tough New England fibre, combining sturdy\r\nphysique, thorough individuality and undiluted common sense, form a\r\ngroundwork on which no modern youth need hesitate to build, while the\r\nmellow background of a virtuous lineage well prepares the canvas for\r\nwhatever of high aim and noble deed shall fill up the fresher\r\nforeground of his own life's picture.\r\n\r\n\"The native temperament of the boy, as I remember him, showed some\r\nrare combinations and counterpoises. With an exuberance of animal\r\nspirits he had, also, a natural balance of _caution_. He was ardent,\r\nbut not hasty; he was self reliant and fearless, but never\r\nprecipitate; frank and affable, though not easily won by a stranger;\r\nfond of experiment, but also intensely practical. He was prompt to\r\ndecide, but always took time for detail, and pursued perseveringly to\r\nthe end whatever engaged his attention and his effort.\r\n\r\n\"His constant association with his father, and with his father's\r\nfriends, made the boy perfectly at home in the office and in the\r\nsociety of professional men; and almost from his cradle he was\r\naccustomed to assist in minor operations and in the general detail of\r\na student's service. Being a discreet lad, he often accompanied the\r\nelder Crosby in professional visits; and thus the face of the 'parvus\r\nIülus,' became, early, as _familiar_ as that of the 'pater Æneas,' and\r\ngrew, later, to be as welcome.\r\n\r\n\"When chloroform in Surgery was first introduced, Dr. Dixi Crosby went\r\nto Boston to study its effects, and was one of the first surgeons in\r\nNew Hampshire to employ it in his practice. Young Ben was then a\r\nschool-boy of fifteen. His father, with full confidence in the\r\ncoolness and self possession of his son, at once commenced training\r\nhim as an assistant for the administration of the anæsthetic; teaching\r\nhim to watch the pulse and respiration, and to note all the necessary\r\nconditions for its safe employment. And from this time, even long\r\nbefore our friend commenced the systematic study of his profession, he\r\nassisted his father, and administered the chloroform in many important\r\noperations, sometimes even making long journeys for the purpose. It is\r\ninteresting to add, also, that in all the years of their practice\r\ntogether, and in all their operations, performed under the use of\r\nchloroform, there never occurred a single accident from its\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n\"On graduating at Dartmouth, in 1853, our young friend pursued his\r\nmedical studies in the office of his father. He attended lectures both\r\nat Dartmouth and at the College of Physicians in New York City, and\r\nserved for one year as interne in the U. S. Marine Hospital at\r\nChelsea, Massachusetts. With the exception of these necessary absences\r\nfrom home, he gave every day of these preparatory years to the\r\nassistance of his father in his wide and laborious practice. To this\r\ncourse he was stimulated no less by filial ardor than by his growing\r\nprofessional zeal.\r\n\r\n\"His medical degree was taken at Dartmouth, in 1856, and instead of\r\n_beginning_ to practice, we may say that he _continued_ to practice\r\nwith his father in Hanover, going in and out as a favorite, both with\r\npatients and in society.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately on receiving his medical degree, Dr. Crosby was appointed\r\ndemonstrator of Pathological Anatomy in the Dartmouth Medical College,\r\nan office which he ably filled for five years.\r\n\r\n\"At the outbreak of the rebellion, in 1861, he was appointed surgeon\r\nof the first regiment New Hampshire Volunteers, for three months'\r\nservice. This being concluded, he was at once commissioned as Brigade\r\nSurgeon of U. S. Volunteers, and soon after promoted to the rank of\r\nMedical Director, serving as such on the staffs, successively, of\r\nGenerale Stone, Casey, Sedgwick, and Peck. His army service was marked\r\nby the same strong individuality, the same resolute activity, the same\r\nexecutive talent, which we have seen stamped upon the boy and the\r\nyouth. Added to all those other qualities, was that same genial\r\nhumanity which made friends of every one. His brother officers trusted\r\nhim, depended upon him, and loved him. The private soldiers idolized\r\nhim, for they saw his quick and constant sympathy for them, and knew\r\nthat his large and loving heart embraced them all in its tender care.\r\n\r\n\"In the noble record of his army service, let us not forget, that to\r\nour lamented friend belongs the credit of having originated and\r\nerected the first complete military hospital on the modern 'pavilion\r\nplan' that was built during the war of the rebellion.\r\n\r\n\"This hospital was visited and admired by surgeons throughout the\r\narmy, as a model of complete ventilation and drainage. Its plans were\r\nextensively copied, and the record of its usefulness is preserved in\r\nthe archives of the War Department.\r\n\r\n\"In all his widening range of work and of social activities says\r\nProfessor Parker, 'his large heart seemed as incapable of being\r\noverloaded with friendships as it was inexhaustible in its overflowing\r\nfriendliness. His personal magnetism held fast old friends, while the\r\nkeen points of his magnetic nature constantly caught new affinities\r\nand drew to him fresh intimacies.'\r\n\r\n\"In the autumn of 1862, he was appointed adjunct professor of Surgery\r\nin Dartmouth, and from that time forward his _honors_, literally,\r\noutran his _years_.\r\n\r\n\"The number of his appointments to professional chairs in different\r\ninstitutions, is something beyond precedent in the history of any\r\nyoung American practitioner.\r\n\r\n\"In 1865, he was invited to the chair of Surgery in the University of\r\nVermont, and in the same year to a similar chair in the University of\r\nMichigan.\r\n\r\n\"Both these positions he accepted, and ably filled for several years.\r\n\r\n\"In 1870, on the resignation of his honored father at the age of\r\nthreescore and ten, Dr. Ben was at once called to the chair of Surgery\r\nin Dartmouth, and entered upon its duties, still continuing to perform\r\nfull duty in both his other professorships. He also delivered a course\r\nof surgical lectures in Bowdoin College, Maine, during the same year.\r\n\r\n\"In 1871, he received the appointment of Surgical professor in the\r\n_Long Island Medical College_, in the city of Brooklyn, which he\r\naccepted, together with the post of visiting surgeon in the hospital\r\nto which the college was attached. His work during this period was\r\nextremely arduous, but was performed with the utmost ability and\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\n\"In 1872, he was invited to a professorship in the New York\r\nUniversity, and also to another (that of Surgical Anatomy) in Bellevue\r\nHospital Medical College in New York City. The former of these he\r\ndeclined, but he accepted the latter and retained it until his death.\r\n\r\n\"In 1873, Dr. Crosby was invited by the Trustees of Jefferson Medical\r\nCollege, Philadelphia, to accept the chair of Anatomy, on the\r\nresignation of the distinguished Dr. Pancoast.\r\n\r\n\"This, though not accepted, may be reckoned the crowning honor in his\r\nwreath of professional laurels.\"\r\n\r\nFor all the qualities which distinguish the model physician, surgeon,\r\nteacher, and companion, few names, in all the annals of Medicine,\r\nstand higher than that of Alpheus Benning Crosby.\r\n\r\nProfessor Crosby married at Baltimore, Md., Mildred Glassell, daughter\r\nof Dr. Wm. R. Smith. He died at Hanover, August 9, 1877.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn closing this record the valuable services of Parsons, Delamater,\r\nBartlett, Holmes, Hubbard, Roby, Williams, Phelps, Field, How, and\r\nFrost should not escape our notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CHANDLER SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT.--THE AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT.--THE\r\nTHAYER DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following account of the Chandler Scientific Department of the\r\ncollege is from the pen of Professor Ruggles and other authentic\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nThe building formerly occupied by Moor's Charity School is now\r\noccupied by this Department.\r\n\r\nExtracts from Mr. Chandler's will give us an idea of the department of\r\ninstruction which he wished to establish.\r\n\r\n\"I give and devise the sum of fifty thousand dollars ... for the\r\nestablishment and support of a permanent department or school of\r\ninstruction in the college, in the practical and useful arts of life,\r\ncomprised chiefly in the branches of Mechanics and Civil Engineering,\r\nthe Invention and Manufacture of Machinery, Carpentry, Masonry,\r\nArchitecture and Drawing, the Investigation of the properties and uses\r\nof the Materials employed in the Arts, the Modern Languages and\r\nEnglish Literature, together with Book-keeping, and such other\r\nbranches of knowledge as may best qualify young persons for the duties\r\nand employments of active life; but, first of all and above all, I\r\nwould enjoin in connection with the above branches, the careful\r\ninculcation of the principles of pure morality, piety, and religion,\r\nwithout introducing topics of controversial theology, that the\r\nbenefits of said department or school may be equally enjoyed by all\r\nreligious denominations without distinction....\r\n\r\n\"To the end that my wishes in respect to the foregoing legacy may be\r\nobserved, I do hereby constitute a perpetual Board of Visitors,\r\nconsisting of two persons, who shall, during the term of their\r\nrespective lives, visit the said department or school as often as they\r\nshall deem it necessary and advisable to do so, and at least once in\r\neach year one or both of said Visitors shall examine the condition of\r\nits funds, and the management and disposition of the same, as well as\r\nthe management of the said department or school generally....\r\n\r\n\"The said Board of Visitors shall have full power to determine,\r\ninterpret, and explain my wishes in respect to this foundation; to\r\nredress grievances, both with respect to professors and students; to\r\nhear appeals from the decisions of the Board of Trustees, and to\r\nprovide remedy upon complaint duly exhibited in behalf of the\r\nprofessors or students; to review and reverse any censure passed by\r\nsaid Trustees upon any professor or student on this foundation; to\r\ndeclare void all rules and regulations made by said Trustees relative\r\nto this foundation, which in their opinion may be inconsistent with my\r\nwishes as herein expressed, or improper or injudicious; to take care\r\nthat the duties of every professor or other officer on this foundation\r\nbe intelligently and faithfully discharged, and to admonish or remove\r\nsuch professor or officer either for misbehavior, incapacity, or\r\nneglect of the duties of his office; to examine into the proficiency\r\nof the students, and to admonish, dismiss, or suspend any student for\r\nnegligence, contumacy or crime, or disobedience to the rules hereafter\r\nto be established for the government of said school or department; and\r\nto see that my true intentions in regard to this foundation be\r\nfaithfully executed.\r\n\r\n\"And in order that said Board of Visitors may not be limited in their\r\npowers by the foregoing recital, I further confer upon the said Board\r\nof Visitors all the visitatorial powers and privileges, which, by the\r\nlaw of the land, belong and are intrusted to any Visitor of any\r\neleemosynary corporation....\r\n\r\n\"As I have perfect confidence in the integrity and ability of my two\r\nesteemed friends, John J. Dixwell and Francis B. Hayes, both of\r\nBoston, aforesaid, and as I know their capacity to perform what I\r\ndesire they should do under this proviso of my will, I constitute and\r\nappoint them to be the first Board of Visitors.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee appointed to draw up the plan for the organization of\r\nthe school consisted of Rev. Dr. Nathan Lord, Hon. Joel Parker, and\r\nEdmund Parker, Esq.\r\n\r\nNo special meeting of the Trustees was called, as had been\r\ncontemplated, and the committee made their report at the regular\r\nmeeting, July 26, 1852, and on the next day the following statutes\r\nwere adopted:\r\n\r\n\"Article I. In accordance with the will of the late Abiel Chandler,\r\nEsq., \"the Trustees of Dartmouth College by this and the following\r\nstatutes, constitute and organize a school of instruction in\r\nconnection with the college and as a department thereof, and the said\r\nschool is denominated 'The Chandler School of Science and the Arts.'\r\n\r\n\"Article II. The school shall consist of two departments, Junior and\r\nSenior. These departments shall be conducted respectively by such\r\nofficers and according to such rules and regulations as the Trustees\r\nshall from time to time appoint and ordain, with the advice and\r\napproval of the Board of Visitors, and in subjection always to the\r\nwill of the Founder.\r\n\r\n\"Article III. In the Junior department of the school, instruction\r\nshall be given in the English language, in Arithmetic and Algebra, in\r\nBook-keeping, Physical Geography, Linear Drawing, Geometry,\r\nPhysiology, Botany, Graphics and use of Instruments, and in such other\r\nelementary studies as may be necessary to qualify students for the\r\nSenior department.\r\n\r\n\"Article IV. The Senior department shall comprise the branches of\r\nMechanics and Civil Engineering, the Invention and Manufacture of\r\nMachinery, Carpentry, Masonry, Architecture and Drawing; the\r\nInvestigation of the Properties and Uses of the Materials employed in\r\nthe Arts, the Modern Languages and English Literature, together with\r\nBook-keeping and such other branches of knowledge as may best qualify\r\nyoung persons for the duties and employments of active life, according\r\nto the will and injunction of the Founder.\r\n\r\n\"Article VII. The term of study in the Junior department shall be one\r\nyear, and in the Senior department two years.\r\n\r\n\"Article VIII. All students who shall have been admitted to the\r\nSenior department and sustained a satisfactory examination at the end\r\nof the course before a committee of gentlemen from abroad appointed by\r\nthe Faculty, shall be entitled to the degree of Bachelor of Science.\"\r\n\r\nHon. John Kelley and Samuel Fletcher, Esq., having been appointed a\r\ncommittee to consider the question of opening the school, made the\r\nfollowing report:\r\n\r\n\"The Chandler Fund appears to be safely invested and productive. It is\r\ntherefore recommended, the school shall be opened for instruction at\r\nthe commencement of the next College Term, and more fully organized as\r\nsoon as a sufficient number of students shall offer themselves for\r\nadmission. But as an experiment is to be made, it is not expedient to\r\nappoint professors and other teachers, until experience shall prove\r\nwhat teachers shall be required. In the mean time it is recommended\r\nthat examination of students presenting themselves for admission to\r\nthe school be made by some member, or members of the Faculty, by the\r\ndirection of the President, and that the Faculty be a committee to\r\nmake suitable provision for rooms and instruction until further orders\r\nof this Board.\"\r\n\r\nThe following resolution was then passed:\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the Chandler School be opened at the commencement of\r\nthe next College Term.\"\r\n\r\nWe give the following extracts from the By-laws which were drawn up by\r\nHon. Joel Parker, and Rev. Silas Aiken, D.D., of Rutland, Vt.:\r\n\r\n\"Vacations.--In the Senior department the terms and vacations shall be\r\ncoincident with the terms and vacations in the academical department\r\nof the college. In the Junior department there shall be four\r\nvacations, one of four weeks, from Commencement, one of two weeks in\r\nthe winter, and one in the spring and autumn of one week each.\r\n\r\n\"Tuition.--Every student in the Senior department shall be charged ten\r\ndollars each term, or thirty dollars for the year, including all\r\nnecessary incidentals. In the Junior department the tuition shall be\r\ntwenty dollars for the year, or five dollars for each term. The bill\r\nof every term shall be paid in advance, and no student shall be\r\npermitted to go on with his class without an exact compliance with\r\nthis statute.\r\n\r\n\"Government.--In other respects the government of the Chandler School\r\nshall be administered according to the By-laws of the college, as now\r\nestablished, so far as those laws may be applicable; and until the\r\nwants of the School may be more definitely ascertained, the regulation\r\nthereof in things not otherwise provided for is submitted to the\r\ndiscretion of the College Faculty.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1852, the school was organized, and seventeen\r\nstudents admitted, two to the Senior and fifteen to the Junior class.\r\nJames W. Patterson, who was a student in the theological school at New\r\nHaven, was elected tutor, and the new institution placed in his\r\ncharge. In July, 1854, Mr. Patterson was elected Chandler Professor of\r\nMathematics, and during the college years 1852-53, and 1853-54, in\r\naddition to the general management, gave nearly all the instruction in\r\nthe Chandler School, at the same time discharged the duties of a tutor\r\nof Latin in the college proper. In 1854, the first class, consisting\r\nof four members, was graduated.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Professor Stephen Chase, in 1851, John S. Woodman had\r\nsucceeded to the chair of Mathematics. In 1855, Professor Woodman\r\nresigned, to enter on the practice of law in Boston, and Mr. Patterson\r\nwas elected in his place. During the next year he continued at the\r\nhead of the Chandler School, and gave the instruction in Mathematics,\r\nand allied branches, in addition to his duties as professor of\r\nMathematics in the Academic Department.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, Professor Woodman was appointed professor of Civil\r\nEngineering, and succeeded Professor Patterson in the care of the\r\nChandler School, in which from its opening he had given some\r\ninstruction. This position he held until 1870, when he was forced to\r\nresign on account of failing health, and was succeeded by Professor\r\nEdward R. Ruggles, who had occupied the chair of Modern Languages and\r\nEnglish Literature since 1866. At the annual meeting of the Board of\r\nTrustees in 1857, it was voted that, \"The regular course of study in\r\nthe Chandler School of Science and the Arts, from the present time,\r\nshall comprise a term of four years.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1862 the name Chandler School of Science and the Art was changed to\r\nChandler Scientific Department of Dartmouth College.\r\n\r\nThe character and usefulness of the Scientific Department from its\r\nfoundation to the present time, may best be learned by studying the\r\ncareer of its graduates in successive classes. It will be observed,\r\nthat the first class of this school graduated less than twenty-five\r\nyears since, and yet in that brief period, its sons have made for it\r\nan honorable record; a record which should bring to it patronage and\r\nimpart to its students a spirit of scholarly pride and emulation. It\r\nmight not be deemed proper to go into a detailed account of the labors\r\nand successes of individuals among its living graduates but it is only\r\nfair to this comparatively youthful department of the college, to say\r\nthat as lawyers, teachers, scientists, engineers, architects, and in\r\nother spheres of practical science, its sons have made for themselves\r\na wide and enviable reputation. The age demands that its institutions\r\nof learning shall impart a scholarship that will bring the forces of\r\nnature under the control of man, and render the student more efficient\r\nin all the industries and business enterprises of the time.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that the Scientific Department of Dartmouth is\r\norganized to meet this demand, and is in full and intelligent sympathy\r\nwith the wants of modern society. From the first its teachers have\r\nbeen able and untiring in their devotion to its permanent prosperity\r\nand welfare, and its success has justified their efforts and zeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts was\r\nestablished by an act of the State Legislature in 1866. We give the\r\nact as recorded in the Revised Statutes.\r\n\r\n\"Section 1. A college is established and made a body politic and\r\ncorporate, by the name of the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and\r\nthe Mechanic Arts, whose leading object is, without excluding other\r\nscientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, to\r\nteach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the\r\nmechanic arts, in conformity to an act of Congress entitled 'An act\r\ndonating land to the several States and Territories, which may provide\r\ncolleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts,\r\napproved July 2, 1862;' and by that name may sue and be sued,\r\nprosecute and defend to final judgment and execution, and is vested\r\nwith all the powers and privileges, and subject to all the\r\nliabilities, incident to corporations of a similar nature.\r\n\r\n\"Sect. 2. The general government of the college is vested in nine\r\nTrustees, five of whom shall be appointed, one from each councillor\r\ndistrict, and commissioned by the Governor, with advice of the\r\ncouncil, and four-by the Trustees of Dartmouth College, so classified\r\nand commissioned that the offices of three shall become vacant\r\nannually; any vacancy occurring shall be filled by the authority which\r\nmade the original appointment.\r\n\r\n\"Sect. 3. The Trustees shall appoint a secretary, who shall be sworn,\r\nand keep a fair and full record of their proceedings; and a treasurer,\r\nwho shall give bond for the faithful discharge of his duties, in such\r\nsum as the Trustees may require, and shall receive such compensation\r\nfor his services as they may deem reasonable. They shall also appoint\r\na Faculty of instruction, prescribe their duties, and invest them with\r\nsuch powers for the immediate government and management of the\r\ninstitution as they may deem most conducive to its best interests.\r\n\r\n\"Sect. 4. No Trustee shall receive any compensation for his services;\r\nbut expenses reasonably incurred by him shall be paid by the college.\r\n\r\n\"Sect. 5. The Trustees shall, on or before the twentieth day of May,\r\nannually, make report to the legislature of the financial condition,\r\noperations, and progress of the college, recording such improvements\r\nand experiments made, with their cost and results, including State,\r\nindustrial, and economical statistics, as may be supposed useful one\r\ncopy of which shall be transmitted to each college endowed under the\r\nprovisions of the aforesaid act of Congress, and one copy to the\r\nSecretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\n\"Sect. 6. The Trustees are authorized and empowered to locate and\r\nestablish the college at Hanover, in connection with Dartmouth\r\nCollege, and, with that Corporation, to make all necessary contracts\r\nrelative to the terms of connection, subject to be terminated upon a\r\nnotice of one year, given at any time after fourteen years, and in\r\nrelation to its furnishing to the college the free use of an\r\nexperimental farm, all requisite buildings, the libraries,\r\nlaboratories, apparatus, and museums of said Dartmouth College, and\r\nfor supplying such instruction, in addition to that furnished by its\r\nprofessors and teachers, as the best interests of its students may\r\nrequire; and also as to any legacy said Dartmouth College may receive\r\nfrom the estate of David Culver. Said Trustees are also directed to\r\nfurnish, so far as may be practicable, free tuition to indigent\r\nstudents, and to make provision for the delivery of free lectures in\r\ndifferent parts of the State upon subjects pertaining to agriculture\r\nand the mechanic arts.\r\n\r\n\"Sect. 7. All funds derived from the sale of land scrip issued to the\r\nState by the United States, in pursuance of the act of Congress\r\naforesaid, shall be invested in registered bonds of the State or of\r\nthe United States, which shall be delivered to the State treasurer,\r\nwho shall have the custody of the same, and pay over the income\r\nthereof, as it may accrue, to the treasurer of the college.\"\r\n\r\nThe great work of securing the requisite funds, and laying foundations\r\nfor this by no means unimportant Department, was committed to the late\r\nProfessor Ezekiel W. Dimond. His early experience in affairs gave him\r\npeculiar fitness for this service. Whether occupied in interviewing\r\nlegislators and capitalists, or in the planning and erection of\r\nedifices, he labored in season and out of season for the\r\naccomplishment of his task, and with large success. When the\r\nDepartment went into operation he was one of its principal teachers,\r\nand in this sphere he left upon his pupils the impress of a well-read\r\nchemist and a devotee to his profession. To his efforts, probably more\r\nthan to those of any other single individual, is New Hampshire\r\nindebted for whatever of success has been attained in this department.\r\nIndeed, should the Agricultural College leave its stamp upon the\r\n\"steep and sterile hillsides,\" or the more prolific valleys of the\r\nGranite State, as it is devoutly to be hoped that in process of time\r\nit may, no name probably will be so familiarly associated with the\r\nhistory of its early struggles for existence as that of Dimond.\r\n\r\nNor were Professor Dimond's services to science limited to this\r\ndepartment of the College.\r\n\r\nIn the Academical and Scientific departments his name appears in the\r\nlist of zealous, painstaking teachers.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dimond's death in 1876, while yet apparently upon the\r\nthreshold of a work to which he gave _his life_, was a public loss.\r\n\r\nOf Professor Thomas R. Crosby, Professor Quimby says:\r\n\r\n\"Entering college in 1839, in the Sophomore class, he bestowed\r\nfaithful labor on the whole course, while at the same time he did not\r\nforget his favorite studies of Medicine and Natural History. Pursuing\r\nthese in his leisure hours, he was fitted to take the degrees of A. B.\r\nand M.D. at the same time, in 1841. With this preparation he entered\r\nat once upon the practice of medicine as his life-work, first at\r\nCampton, afterward at Hartford, Vt., Meriden, and Manchester. He was\r\none of the active men in originating the Hillsborough Agricultural\r\nSociety. He had a hand in organizing the State Society, and in\r\npreparing the first volume of the Society's Transactions. Nearly at\r\nthe same time the above society was originated, the publication of the\r\n\"Granite Farmer\" was commenced, and Dr. Crosby was employed to edit\r\nit, in which position he did well. He was for a time city physician of\r\nManchester, and came near being elected its mayor. His health having\r\nfailed in some measure, he removed to Norwich, Vt., the home of his\r\nwife's family. For ten years he lived in Norwich and Hanover, engaged\r\nin such teaching and practice and study as his health would permit.\r\nWhen our country called for aid in the war of the rebellion he\r\nbelieved it his duty to consecrate his knowledge of Medicine and skill\r\nin Surgery to her, and to the noble men who exposed themselves to\r\nsickness and wounds in her cause. Upon entering the service he was\r\nimmediately put in charge of the Columbian College Hospital, in\r\nWashington. He assumed the responsibilities of the position with the\r\ndetermination that the men who came under his charge 'should have\r\ntheir rights,' and faithfully did he carry into execution his purpose.\r\nHe remained in charge of this Hospital until after the close of the\r\nwar and the sick and wounded were able to be transferred to their\r\nhomes. The next year he was appointed professor of General and\r\nMilitary Surgery and Hygiene in the National Medical College, it being\r\nthe Medical Department of Columbian College, which position he filled\r\nuntil 1870. On the opening of the State Agricultural College here, an\r\ninstitution in which he was particularly interested, he was appointed\r\nprofessor of Animal and Vegetable Physiology, in which, and in Natural\r\nHistory in the Academic Department, he taught almost literally till\r\nthe day of his decease. When unable to meet his classes in their\r\nrecitation-room he received them in his own study, and there heard\r\ntheir recitations, the last less than forty-eight hours before his\r\ndeath. Thus he fell 'with the harness on.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAYER SCHOOL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING.\r\n\r\nOf this department Professor Fletcher says:\r\n\r\n\"Between the years 1867 and 1871, General Sylvanus Thayer, of\r\nBraintree, Massachusetts, by donations amounting in the aggregate to\r\nseventy thousand dollars, made provision for establishing in\r\nconnection with the college a special course of instruction in Civil\r\nEngineering. 'The venerable donor, himself a distinguished officer of\r\nthe U. S. Corps of Engineers, was moved to this munificence, not only\r\nby a regard for his Alma Mater, but also by a desire to provide for\r\nyoung men possessing requisite ability a thorough and exclusively\r\nprofessional training.'\r\n\r\n\"The school was organized during the winter and spring of 1871, by\r\nProfessor Robert Fletcher, under the immediate direction of General\r\nThayer. The general character and aim of the course are indicated by\r\nthe following quotation from the Instrument of Gift: 'The requisites\r\nfor admission to the school shall be of a high order, embracing such\r\nstudies, at least, as are specified in a paper to be hereto appended,\r\ncalled 'Programme A,' bearing my signature, which programme shall be\r\nregarded as an absolute minimum, and which may, in the discretion of\r\nthe Board of Overseers, created by the 5th article of this\r\nInstrument, be extended, but not diminished or contracted in the least\r\ndegree.'\r\n\r\n\"'2. The course of study shall extend through at least two years, and\r\nthe duration of the course may be further extended so as to include\r\nanother half year, should three or more members of the Board of\r\nOverseers judge, after a fair trial of the two years' course, such\r\nfurther extension to be expedient. The studies and instruction of each\r\nyear shall extend continuously from September first to July first\r\nfollowing.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Instruction was begun to a regular class of the engineering course,\r\nSeptember, 1871. During the preceding months of the year preparatory\r\ninstruction had been given. From 1871 to 1873, a preparatory course of\r\ntwo years was contemplated, and during the year 1872-3 was maintained\r\nin connection with the higher course. Meanwhile the detailed statement\r\nof requisites for admission, styled 'Programme A,' was prepared by\r\nProfessor Fletcher, under supervision of General Thayer, and with the\r\naid of several professors eminent in the various subjects which it\r\nincludes. These requirements embrace all the branches of a common\r\nschool education, a full course of pure Mathematics and a thorough\r\ncourse in Physics, including theoretical Chemistry and Astronomy. The\r\nhigh standard thus established justified the following announcement in\r\nthe College 'Catalogue.' 'The department is to be essentially, though\r\nnot formally, post-graduate. The course of study is to be of the\r\nhighest order, passing beyond what is possible in institutions for\r\ngeneral culture, and is designed to prepare the capable and faithful\r\nstudent for responsible positions and difficult service.' It was\r\nintended that the Preparatory Department should provide instruction in\r\nthe subjects embraced in 'Programme A.'\r\n\r\n\"The decease of General Thayer in October, 1872, deprived the School\r\nof his personal supervision. The general direction of its affairs then\r\ndevolved on the Board of Overseers constituted by his Instrument of\r\nGift and appointed by himself. At that time the Board consisted of\r\nRev. A. D. Smith, D.D., LL. D., president of Dartmouth College, Prof.\r\nO. P. Hubbard of New Haven, formerly at Dartmouth College, Prof.\r\nGeorge L. Andrews, of the U. S. Military Academy, Gen. John C.\r\nPalfrey, C. E., of Lowell, Massachusetts, and Prof. P. S. Michie, of\r\nthe U. S. Military Academy. The last three gentlemen had been officers\r\nin the U. S. Corps of Engineers.\r\n\r\n\"At its first meeting in May, 1873, the Board decided that it would\r\nnot be expedient for some time to come to maintain such an auxiliary\r\nas a Preparatory Department. It was found that the limited means\r\nprovided by the founder would allow the attainment of his high ideal\r\nonly by working within comparatively narrow limits. Without attempting\r\nto cover too broad a field, a high standard and thorough work were to\r\nbe essential features of the course.\r\n\r\n\"The Board of Overseers holds a meeting at Dartmouth College annually,\r\nwhen it examines carefully into the working of the school, its\r\nfinancial condition, etc., and adopts any measures promising to effect\r\nimprovement and secure greater efficiency, according to the powers\r\nconferred upon it by the Instrument of Gift. The Board also examines\r\nthe students and recommends such members of the first class as it\r\nfinds to be qualified, to the Trustees of Dartmouth College for the\r\ndegree of Civil Engineer.\r\n\r\n\"The first class which completed the two years' course graduated in\r\n1873. The class of 1877 was the fifth sent out by the school. At that\r\ntime the whole number of graduates was thirteen. There had been,\r\nbesides, two who left for professional engagements after the first\r\nyear of study. The graduates have nearly all obtained honorable\r\npositions in the line of the profession soon after graduation, with\r\nfair prospects for distinction.\r\n\r\n\"The nature of the course is such that a large corps of instructors is\r\nnot required. Careful training and drill in essential and fundamental\r\nbranches is the aim. Considerable time is devoted to out-door practice\r\nbut without attempt to make experts in any direction. Accordingly,\r\ntemporary employment in a professional line is allowed at proper\r\ntimes, such as will conduce to the student's improvement and be more\r\nor less remunerative. Thus it is expected that the student will be\r\nfitted to advance rapidly and successfully in any 'specialty' to which\r\nhe may subsequently devote his efforts.\r\n\r\n\"The school is now hardly in full operation, as some features about\r\nthe course are still experimental. It has its history yet to make.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nBENEFACTORS.--TRUSTEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom various authentic sources we have the following sketches of\r\nDartmouth's leading benefactors, always excepting the last Royal\r\nGovernor of New Hampshire, John Wentworth, whose care for all the\r\ninterests of the Province is a matter of enduring record. Of the\r\ndistinguished person in honor of whom the College was named, the\r\nfollowing account, published in 1779, is from \"Collins' Peerage\":\r\n\r\n\"William, _the present and Second Earl of Dartmouth_, for his more\r\npolite education, traveled through France, Italy, and Germany; and, on\r\nhis return to England, took the oaths, and his seat in the House of\r\nPeers, on May 31, 1754. His Lordship was sworn of His Majesty's Privy\r\nCouncil on July 26, 1765; in August following he was appointed first\r\nCommissioner of Trade and Plantations, which he resigned in 1766; in\r\nAugust, 1772, he was appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies;\r\nand on November 10, 1775, Keeper of the Privy Seal.\r\n\r\n\"His Lordship married, on January 11, 1755, Frances Catharine, only\r\ndaughter and heir of Sir Charles Gunter Nicholl, Knight of the Bath;\r\nand by her had issue eight sons and one daughter.\r\n\r\n\"His Lordship is also President of the London Dispensary;\r\nVice-President of the Foundling and Lock Hospitals; Recorder of\r\nLitchfield; LL. D., and F. R. S.\"\r\n\r\nThe armorial inscription is:\r\n\r\n\"GAUDET TENTAMINE VIRTUS.\"\r\n\r\nForbes' Life of Dr. Beattie gives the following interesting paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty (George III.) asked what I thought of my new\r\nacquaintance, Lord Dartmouth. I said, there was something in his air\r\nand manner which seemed to me not only agreeable, but very enchanting,\r\nand that he seemed to me to be one of the best of men; a sentiment in\r\nwhich both their majesties heartily joined. 'They say that Lord\r\nDartmouth is an enthusiast,' said the king, 'but surely he says\r\nnothing on the subject of religion but what every one may and ought to\r\nsay on the subject of religion.'\"\r\n\r\nOf John Thornton, the devout Episcopalian, the kinsman of Wilberforce,\r\nand the most munificent of Dartmouth's early benefactors, almost the\r\nsole supporter of the founder for several years, Rev. Thomas Scott, in\r\na memorial \"Discourse\" says:\r\n\r\n\"It is worthy of observation, that this friend of mankind, in the\r\nexercise of his beneficence, not only contributed his money (which\r\noften is done to very little purpose) but he devoted his time and\r\nthoughts very much to the same object; doing good was the great\r\nbusiness of his life, and may more properly be said to have been his\r\noccupation, than even his mercantile engagements, which were uniformly\r\nconsidered as subservient to that nobler design.\r\n\r\n\"To form and execute plans of usefulness; to superintend, arrange, and\r\nimprove upon those plans; to lay aside such as did not answer, and to\r\nsubstitute others; to form acquaintance, and collect intelligence for\r\nthis purpose; to select proper agents, and to carry on correspondence,\r\nin order to ascertain that his bounties were well applied: These and\r\nsimilar concerns were the hourly occupations of his life, and the ends\r\nof living, which he proposed to himself; nor did he think that any\r\npart of his time was spent either happily or innocently, if it were\r\nnot some way instrumental, directly or indirectly, to the furtherance\r\nof useful designs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Abiel Chandler was a native of Concord, N. H. In his childhood his\r\nparents removed to Fryeburg, Maine, where he labored on a farm till he\r\nwas twenty-one years of age. He was graduated at Harvard College in\r\n1806, and spent the next eleven years in teaching at Salem and\r\nNewburyport, Mass. To the good reputation which he had previously\r\ngained as a student, he added that of an excellent preceptor. A\r\nlittle later he commenced a mercantile life at Boston. He was of the\r\nhouse of Chandler and Howard, and afterwards Chandler, Howard, and\r\nCompany, for more than a quarter of a century, when he retired with a\r\nfortune. To numerous relatives he made liberal bequests, with great\r\ndelicacy and judgment. After his legacy to the college, the residue of\r\nhis property was bequeathed to the New Hampshire Asylum for the\r\nInsane.\r\n\r\n\"The origin of Mr. Chandler's endowment of the Scientific School is\r\nreferable to an incident that occurred to him when a young man at\r\nFryeburg. He fell in company with some students of Dartmouth College,\r\nand he was impressed by their superiority to himself. He conceived the\r\npurpose of being himself a scholar, and he fulfilled it. When, after a\r\nfew years of honorable industry as a teacher he became a merchant, he\r\nsaw himself, though now a scholar, ignorant, to a great extent, of the\r\nprinciples and methods of mercantile life. Whereupon he set himself to\r\na new variety of learning. He gained it, and with it gained a fortune.\r\nBut he saw other men around him, in different spheres, suffering as he\r\nhad done from a similar want of knowledge,--merchants, traders,\r\nship-masters, artisans, farmers, laborers.\r\n\r\n\"The Chandler School is the ripened fruit of a well-considered purpose\r\nto benefit mankind. He had confidence in the importance of his object,\r\nthe integrity of his aims, and the wisdom of his advisers. He bestowed\r\nhis charity with a hearty good-will, and left the event with God.\"\r\n\r\n\"_John Conant_ was born in Stowe, Mass., in 1790. His family descended\r\nfrom the French Huguenots who were driven into England by Louis XIV.\r\nHis father was an industrious and successful farmer. In the district\r\nschool he was taught the merest rudiments of an English education. In\r\nafter years, by the aid and sympathy of an intelligent and\r\nwell-educated wife, he fitted himself to write for the public\r\njournals, to lecture on temperance and agriculture, and to perform\r\nwith credit and honor the duties of important official stations, in\r\ntown and State. His leisure hours were devoted to study. He collected\r\na small private library of choice books in history, biography, and\r\nscience, and made them the companions of rainy days and winter\r\nevenings.\r\n\r\n\"At the age of twenty-six, he purchased a farm in Jaffrey, under the\r\nshadow of 'the great Monadnock,' on which he labored for thirty-five\r\nyears, and gathered 'a plentiful estate.' This was accumulated by\r\nmeans of those home-bred virtues, industry, prudence, and economy; for\r\nhe never, in a single instance, increased his wealth by speculation.\r\n\r\n\"When the New Hampshire Insane Asylum was occupying the public\r\nattention, he contributed liberally to its endowment, and was at one\r\ntime president of its Board of Trustees, being sole superintendent of\r\nthe first buildings that were reared.\r\n\r\n\"Turning his thoughts toward the rising academy at New London, Mr.\r\nConant proposed to add to its literary and scientific departments an\r\nagricultural school. He ascertained, however, that his whole estate\r\nwould be inadequate to the work, and, after making generous donations\r\nto the academy, he turned his attention to the Agricultural College at\r\nHanover.\r\n\r\n\"In his endowment of this institution, along with other things, he has\r\nprovided a model farm for the college, and founded a scholarship for\r\neach town in Cheshire County, twenty-two in all, with an additional\r\none for Jaffrey.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Conant was through life a liberal contributor to public\r\nenterprises, and a supporter of the gospel, and for twenty years was\r\nan active member of the Baptist Church.\"\r\n\r\nBoynton's History of West Point gives the following valuable\r\nparagraphs relating to Sylvanus Thayer, by whose munificence to the\r\ncause of education he has laid his Alma Mater and his native town\r\nunder lasting obligations:\r\n\r\n\"Brevet-major Sylvanus Thayer, of the Corps of Engineers, on July 28,\r\n1817, assumed command as superintendent of the West Point Military\r\nAcademy, and from this period the commencement of whatever success as\r\nan educational institution, and whatever reputation the Academy may\r\npossess, at home or abroad, for its strict, impartial, salutary,\r\nelevating, and disciplinary government, must be dated. Major Thayer\r\nwas an early graduate of the academy. He had served with distinction\r\nin the War of 1812, and had studied the military schools of France,\r\nand profited by the opportunity to acquire more complete and just\r\nviews concerning the management of such an institution than were\r\ngenerally entertained by educational and military men of that day. The\r\nfield before him was uncultivated; the period was one when rare\r\nqualifications for position were not considered valueless; and,\r\nblessed with health, devotion to the cause, and firmness of purpose,\r\nhe was permitted to organize a system, and remain sixteen years to\r\nperfect its operation.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately after entering upon his duties, the Cadets were organized\r\ninto a battalion of two companies, with a colonel of Cadets, an\r\nadjutant, and a sergeant-major, for its staff; and within the year he\r\ncreated a 'Commandant of Cadets,' to be an instructor of tactics.\r\n\r\n\"The division of classes into sections, the weekly rendering of class\r\nreports, showing the daily progress, the system and scale of daily\r\nmarks, the establishment of relative class rank among the members, the\r\npublication of the Annual Register, the introduction of the Board of\r\nVisitors, the check-book system, the preponderating influence of the\r\n'blackboard,' and the essential parts of the Regulations for the\r\nMilitary Academy, as they stand to this day, are some of the evidences\r\nof the indefatigable efforts of Major Thayer to insure method, order,\r\nand prosperity to the institution. When relieved, at his own request,\r\nthe upward impetus given to the institution had attracted general\r\nobservation.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Thayer evidently believed that \"peace hath her victories\" as\r\nwell as war, and nobly acted in accordance with his intelligent,\r\nearnest convictions.\r\n\r\n\"Joel Parker was born at Jaffrey, N. H. After studying in the academy\r\nat Groton, where the late President James Walker was one of his\r\nschoolmates, he entered the Sophomore class at Dartmouth College in\r\nFebruary, 1809, at the early age of thirteen, and graduated in 1811,\r\nnot yet seventeen years of age. After his graduation he studied law at\r\nKeene, and with his brother Edmund at Amherst, and entered the bar of\r\nCheshire County, at the October term in 1817, at the former place,\r\nwhere he at once engaged in practice.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1821, contemplating a change of residence, he visited the\r\nWest, and was admitted to practice in the Circuit Court of the United\r\nStates at Columbus, Ohio, in January, 1822; but, fortunately for his\r\nnative State, returned in the latter year, and devoted himself\r\nassiduously to his chosen pursuit.\r\n\r\nFree from domestic cares, affianced only to his profession, he early\r\ngained an honorable position by the steady exercise of natural\r\nabilities well adapted to its pursuit. He was industrious, thorough,\r\nminute, painstaking, cautious, persistent, and untiring. \"Judge\r\nParker's mode of practice in the trial of cases,\" writes an early\r\nprofessional associate, who still enjoys a ripe and honored age, \"to\r\ntake down the testimony in full of the witnesses in writing, and to\r\ncross-examine them at great length as to all the circumstances they\r\nmight know relative to the case, contributed greatly to change the\r\nprevious practice of the witness' first telling his story of what he\r\nknew, followed by a brief cross-examination, with only a few notes,\r\nmade by the counsel, of the leading points of the testimony.\"\r\n\r\nOf Judge Parker's judicial life in New Hampshire, Charles Sumner, in\r\n1844, wrote: \"It will not be unjust to his associates to distinguish.\r\nMr. Chief Justice Parker as entitled to peculiar honor for his\r\nservices on the bench. He may be justly regarded as one of the ablest\r\njudges of the country.\"\r\n\r\nThe event which brought Judge Parker more conspicuously before the\r\npublic, and undoubtedly contributed justly and largely to give him a\r\nwide and established reputation for vigor, independence, learning, and\r\ncapacity, was his controversy with 14 Mr. Justice Story of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States in regard to the proper construction of a\r\nclause--it might even be said the meaning of a word [lien]--in the\r\nBankrupt Law of 1841; a controversy which became political in other\r\nhands, and threatened to reach the magnitude of a conflict between the\r\nUnited States and New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nAfter the experiences of this generation, such a collision seems\r\ntrifling; but it involved subjects of grave importance, and was a\r\ncontest between no insignificant combatants,--not without interest at\r\nthis day to a student of common or constitutional law.\r\n\r\nIt began in 1842, when Story and Parker were each in the full vigor of\r\njudicial life, and enthusiastic crowds of young men were learning the\r\nscience of the law from Story's lips. It ended seven years after, when\r\nStory had passed away, and Parker was lecturing where Story taught, to\r\nyoung men who now revere the memory of both. He had laid aside the\r\nhonor and labors of the office which required him to engage in the\r\nstruggle; and, in the first year of his service as a professor in the\r\nschool to whose success and reputation Story had so largely\r\ncontributed, the court which Story had adorned declared the survivor\r\nvictorious. Like Entellus, he might say,--\r\n\r\n    \"Hic victor cestus artemque repono.\"\r\n\r\nThe eminent service rendered to the country and the age, by Judge\r\nParker, while Royall professor of Law at Cambridge, forms a material\r\npart of our national history.\r\n\r\nRichard Fletcher was a native of Cavendish, Vt. Having graduated at\r\nDartmouth, in 1806, he studied law with Daniel Webster, and commenced\r\npractice in Salisbury, N. H. In 1819 he removed to Boston, where he\r\nshortly took rank with the very first of legal advocates.\r\n\r\nHis biographer says: \"While in practice before the courts his presence\r\never commanded the utmost respect. Of good form, of handsome and\r\nexpressive features, and of most gentlemanly and pleasing address,\r\nwith his great learning and untiring industry, it is not strange that\r\nhe should have succeeded at the bar and on the bench.\r\n\r\n\"He was an orator of great power,--fluent and elegant in diction,\r\nbright and sparkling in thought, keen and quick in repartee.\r\n\r\n\"His care not to be engaged in unworthy causes was a matter of note.\r\n\r\n\"In political life he found little that suited his tastes, although at\r\ndifferent times a member of both the State and National Legislatures.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fletcher was a sincere Christian. His religion was not so much of\r\nthe aggressive kind, nor did he often urge his views upon others; but\r\nit pervaded his entire character, and shone out in all his actions. In\r\nhis will he made a provision for publishing biennially, a prize essay\r\nadapted to impress 'on the minds of all Christians a solemn sense of\r\ntheir duty to exhibit in their godly lives and conversation the\r\nbeneficent effects of the religion they profess, and thus increase the\r\nefficiency of Christianity in Christian countries, and recommend its\r\nacceptance to the heathen portions of the world.'\"\r\n\r\nFew of Dartmouth's alumni have manifested a more affectionate,\r\nsteadfast devotion to their Alma Mater, than Mr. Fletcher.\r\n\r\nTappan Wentworth was the son of Isaac Wentworth, of Dover, N. H., and\r\nwas born there February 24, 1802, and died in Lowell, June 12, 1875.\r\nHis father was a poor man, a boatman running a freight-boat between\r\nDover and Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nHe was sent first to common schools till he reached the classical\r\nschool where he studied Latin in a class with the late John K. Young,\r\nD.D., Dr. George W. Kittredge, and Hon. John H. White, but was taken\r\nfrom school after having read two books of Virgil. Judge White says:\r\n\"Tappan was a good scholar, energetic and self-reliant. I was in the\r\nLatin class with him, and was told by the father that he was too poor\r\nto keep him in school.\" He then spent about three years in Portsmouth,\r\nin a North End grocery store.\r\n\r\nFrom Portsmouth he went to South Berwick, Me., into the stores of the\r\nlate Benjamin Nason and Alphonso Gerrish, successively, as clerk. He\r\nthere attracted the attention of Hon. William Burleigh, a then member\r\nof Congress from York district, by a spirited article he had written\r\nin favor of Mr. Burleigh's reëlection. Mr. Burleigh now offered to\r\ntake him as a law student, and the young clerk entered upon the study\r\nof law, and was admitted to the bar in York County in 1826. After\r\nseven years' successful practice in his profession in South Berwick\r\nand Great Falls, he came to Lowell, bringing some seven thousand\r\ndollars with him.\r\n\r\nHe now seemed to form his life plan of work, professionally and\r\nfinancially,--diligence in his profession and all possible investments\r\nin real estate. At his death his $7,000 had swollen into nearly\r\n$300,000, during his forty-five years of Lowell life.\r\n\r\nDuring these years he became a leading member of his profession, was\r\noften in offices of trust in city affairs, at different times in both\r\nhouses of the Legislature, and a member of Congress from 1853 to 1855.\r\n\r\nAfter assigning \"pride of ancestry and name\" as one reason for Mr.\r\nWentworth's munificence to Dartmouth, Judge Crosby says:\r\n\r\n\"Another reason for the gift to the college is found in his\r\nappreciation of the value, the power, and the beauty of education. He\r\nhad had hard experience in relation to it. He had hungered for it when\r\nhe could not get it. He had obtained it in limited departments, by\r\nhard work, at great odds and under great embarrassments, when other\r\nclaims must be postponed in its behalf. And as he looked over our\r\ncollege studies he found many branches he had never pursued and could\r\nnot approach.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fund is not given for scholarships, professorships, libraries, or\r\nbuildings. It is given for the support of the institution, to make\r\ninstruction independent, learned and cheap; given to invite the youth\r\nto come here, and to give them the best opportunities of cultivation\r\nat lessened expense, to lay foundations of learning and mental\r\nenlargement for any department in life. It will maintain ten learned\r\nprofessors or twenty tutors, or give 20,000 volumes of books annually,\r\nas the honorable Trustees shall think the demands of the college\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\n\"It may enlarge, repair, or ornament these grounds; it may be turned\r\ninto laboratories, museums of natural history, or art; it may raise\r\nthe curriculum to higher studies and extended courses. It is not\r\nrestrained by his personal judgment and direction in the future, but\r\nleft to the better judgment of living mind.\"\r\n\r\nShould Dartmouth ever lose her maiden name, she would not hesitate in\r\nregard to the new one.\r\n\r\nWilliam Reed was born at Marblehead, Mass. Compelled to abandon the\r\nhope of a public education, he afterwards engaged in mercantile\r\npursuits, which he followed with great energy and activity and with a\r\ngood degree of success.\r\n\r\nHaving by his untiring energy and perseverance, and by his strict\r\nhabits of economy come into possession of a considerable amount of\r\nproperty, he devoted the latter part of his life to philanthropic and\r\nbenevolent purposes.\r\n\r\nAs a citizen he was distinguished for activity, public spirit and true\r\npatriotism. The many marks of attention and respect which he received\r\nfrom his fellow-citizens evinced the high estimation in which he was\r\nheld by the community.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 he was elected to a seat in the Congress of the United States,\r\na station which he filled for four years with honor to himself, with\r\nsatisfaction to his constituents, and with advantage to his country.\r\n\r\nWhile the cause of Foreign Missions received the largest share of his\r\nChristian sympathies and the largest amount of his charitable\r\ndonations, yet he was deeply interested in all the benevolent\r\noperations of the day. His sound judgment was sought in the management\r\nof various public institutions. In 1826 he was elected a member of the\r\nBoard of Visitors of the Theological Seminary at Andover, and occupied\r\nthat station until his death. He was for several years a Trustee of\r\nDartmouth; also of Amherst.\r\n\r\nDr. George Cheyne Shattuck was born in Templeton, Mass., in the year\r\n1783, in the sixth generation from William Shattuck, who was born in\r\nEngland in the year 1621, and died in Watertown, Mass., in the year\r\n1672, Dr. Benjamin Shattuck graduated at Harvard College in 1765, and\r\nhaving studied medicine, settled in Templeton. His youngest son\r\ninherited thirteen hundred dollars, and this sufficed for his support,\r\nfitting for college, and college and Medical education, commenced at\r\nHanover and continued in Philadelphia and Boston, with such addition\r\nas he was able to make by school-keeping. There were no public\r\nconveyances when he went from Templeton to Hanover, and he bought a\r\nhorse on which he rode to Hanover and then sold it, taking the pay in\r\nboard. He received four degrees from his Alma Mater; the first in the\r\nyear 1803 and the last, of Doctor of Laws, in 1853. He settled in\r\nBoston in the year 1807, and for the space of forty-seven years\r\ndevoted himself to the practice of his profession. He secured the\r\nesteem, respect and affection of his patients, and gathered a handsome\r\nestate. He gave liberally to his Alma Mater for an Observatory, for\r\nbooks, and for portraits of distinguished alumni. He founded a\r\nprofessorship in the Medical Department of Harvard University and\r\nendowed scholarships in the Academical Department. He gave liberally\r\nto various charities during his lifetime, as well as to public\r\ninstitutions, and the poor and needy never appealed to him in vain. He\r\ndied in Boston in the year 1854, in the profession of the faith in\r\nwhich he had been educated both at home and at college.\r\n\r\nGeorge H. Bissell was born at Hanover, N. H. He is descended from a\r\nfamily of Norman-French origin, which came from Somersetshire,\r\nEngland. His mother came of Belgic and Holland descent. One of his\r\nancestors was the first settler at Windsor, Ct., in 1628. The late\r\nGov. Clark Bissell, of Connecticut, and Gov. William H. Bissell, of\r\nIllinois, were relatives. In 1846, after successful teaching\r\nelsewhere, on the organization of the High School in New Orleans Mr.\r\nBissell was elected its first principal over many competitors.\r\nSubsequently he was chosen superintendent of the public schools in\r\nthat city. His remarkable administrative abilities and high\r\nqualifications as a scholar were of great service in his onerous\r\nposition. The schools reached a discipline and prosperity before\r\nunknown. He is also a member of the legal profession.\r\n\r\nIn the development of petroleum Mr. Bissell was a leading pioneer;\r\nperhaps he justly deserves the preëminence in this great work. Mr.\r\nBissell is a self-made man. We quote a portion of his letter to\r\nPresident Smith, announcing his munificent donation for a gymnasium:\r\n\r\n\"In acceding to your wishes, my dear sir, I can but recall that day,\r\nnow twenty years since, when, leaving Dartmouth, alone and unaided, I\r\nfelt that 'Tentanda via est, quâ me quoque possim tollere humo.'\r\n\r\n\"It affords me unqualified pleasure now to be able to gratify a wish\r\nthen cherished, to aid in some degree my Alma Mater, and in that\r\nmanner which you assure me is the most effectual.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gen. David Culver was born in Lyme, N. H. In the year 1832 he left\r\nthe parental roof, and after a residence in Hartford, Conn., and New\r\nYork City, for some years, where in both cities he was actively\r\nengaged in lucrative business pursuits, he returned to his beautiful\r\nancestral home in Lyme, in 1855. The residue of his years he spent in\r\npleasant agricultural life, on the old farm of his strongly-endeared\r\nchildhood, memory, and attachment. In the rural district of this home\r\nhe was ever apparently content and happy, and, much to his praise,\r\nseemed greatly beloved by his neighbors. His townsmen many times by\r\ntheir united suffrage gave him important offices of public trust and\r\nconfidence. Of the Congregational Church of Christ, in Lyme, he was\r\nfor many years a highly valued helping member, and for the gospel\r\nministry was a liberal supporter, giving of his means in so quiet a\r\nmanner that he appeared not to wish his good deeds blazoned to the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\"For the needy, suffering poor of his personal acquaintance,\r\nespecially the helpless poor, he had a sympathizing heart, and so\r\ndeeply pitied them, in many instances, as to greatly alleviate their\r\nsufferings by ministering pecuniarily to their relief.\r\n\r\n\"To the cause of general education in the community,--elementary,\r\ncommon, agricultural, and collegiate,--he was always a warm-hearted,\r\ndeeply-interested friend. In many instances, to aspiring youth in\r\nindigent circumstances, who were striving after the acquisition of the\r\nneedful knowledge to prepare themselves and others for usefulness, he\r\nhas been known to bestow pecuniary assistance to aid them on their\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\"And so agreeably bland was he in his mode of conferring his favors,\r\nas to greatly augment the value of them, and at the same time heighten\r\nthe esteem of the recipients for the donor.\" Outside of her alumni\r\nDartmouth had few warmer friends than General Culver.\r\n\r\nSamuel Appleton was a native of New Ipswich, N. H.\r\n\r\nHis enterprise and his liberality have given his name a conspicuous\r\nplace in New England history. We append a portion of one of his\r\nletters to President Lord, which shows his generous appreciation of\r\nliberal culture.\r\n\r\n\"It affords me much pleasure to have it in my power to do something\r\nfor the only college in my native State which has done so much to\r\nestablish a sound literary character in the country. Dartmouth has\r\ndone her full proportion in educating for the pulpit, the bar, the\r\nhealing art, and the senate, good and great men who have done honor to\r\ntheir names, to the college, and to the country.\"\r\n\r\nIn closing this record, we can only allude to other leading\r\nbenefactors, among whom are John D. Willard, who gave to Dartmouth\r\nsome of the fruits of his busy, earnest life. Salmon P. Chase, loyal\r\nto his Alma Mater to the last. John Wentworth, who still lives to\r\nwitness her work. Henry Bond, loving her scarcely less than his\r\nkindred, \"according to the flesh.\" Frederick Hall, who gave his money,\r\nand what he valued more. John Phillips, whose name will live as long\r\nas Dartmouth, or Andover, or Exeter, shall exist. Israel Evans, the\r\npatriot divine, who cherished for Washington and Wheelock similar\r\naffection. Aaron Lawrence, the conscientious Christian merchant.\r\nJeremiah Kingman, the busy agriculturist, who cultivated his mind as\r\nwell as his fields. Mrs. Betsey Whitehouse, the parishioner of Abraham\r\nBurnham, by whose labors her valuable Christian and general character\r\nwas largely moulded, and E. W. Stoughton, who fully realizes the close\r\nconnection between a healthy body and a sound mind.\r\n\r\nThe services of Dartmouth's Trustees should not be passed over in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nWe give a statement of the character of the Board half a century ago,\r\nwhen the College was in \"middle life,\" from Mr. William H. Duncan.\r\n\r\n\"Of the members of that Board, there was Elijah Paine, of Vermont, who\r\nhad received his appointment as District Judge of the United States\r\nfor the District of Vermont from Washington, a graduate from Harvard,\r\n'a Roman of the Romans,' one who would have done honor to Rome in her\r\nnoblest and best days for the purity, integrity, and elevation of his\r\ncharacter. Charles Marsh, who held for many years the unchallenged\r\nposition of the leader of the bar in Vermont, a cousin of that giant\r\nin the law, Jeremiah Mason, whom he greatly resembled in many of his\r\nintellectual characteristics,--a high-toned gentleman, and a devout\r\nand reverend believer in Christianity. Moses P. Payson, a graduate of\r\nthe College, of the class of 1793, a lawyer of courteous and elegant\r\ndemeanor, and of high social position. Judge Edmund Parker, a sound\r\nlawyer, a man of good sense, and excellent judgment, and above all a\r\nman of unspotted character, a brother of the distinguished ex-Chief\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire. Israel W. Putnam, D.D.,\r\na graduate of the class of 1809, so long and so favorably known in New\r\nHampshire as a clergyman. John H. Church, D.D., a graduate from\r\nHarvard, a man of apostolic solemnity and dignity of character, whose\r\npraise is in all the churches. John Wheeler, D.D., an accomplished\r\nscholar, afterwards President of the University of Vermont. Bennett\r\nTyler, who was still a Trustee, although he had resigned his position\r\nas president, a man of commanding dignity of presence, an unrivaled\r\nlogician, and one of the best pulpit orators it has ever been the good\r\nfortune of the writer to listen to. Judge Samuel Hubbard, of Boston,\r\none of the best lawyers of New England, who for many years was the\r\nrival and the peer of the leaders of the Suffolk Bar. When on the\r\nbench of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, he was numbered among her\r\nmost eminent jurists, and was ranked with Fletcher and Shaw. He was a\r\nman of the finest sensibilities, and a devout and reverent Christian.\r\nMills Olcott, of the class of 1790, who had been the Secretary and\r\nTreasurer of the College before he was a Trustee, whose father had\r\nserved before him for twenty years in the same capacity, a man of\r\nremarkable sagacity and enterprise in business affairs, of assured\r\nsocial position, and of great elegance and dignity of manner.\r\n\r\n\"And of this body of men was Ezekiel Webster, the elder brother of\r\nDaniel, a man of remarkable intellectual endowments; in sagacity and\r\njudgment, in the opinion of those who knew them both, fully equal to\r\nhis distinguished brother, well read, as all the gentlemen of the old\r\nschool were, in the old English authors; a profound lawyer, and, at\r\ntimes when he could be prevailed upon to speak, as eloquent as his\r\nbrother; of commanding personal presence, which in no way can be so\r\nwell described as by borrowing a Homeric epithet, for he was truly a\r\n'king' among 'men.'\r\n\r\n\"Such was the body of men whose grave and majestic air used to impress\r\nthe writer of this sketch, when the Commencements came round, in his\r\ncollege days, with the same feeling of awe and reverence with which\r\nthe barbarians' were inspired when they first looked in upon the Roman\r\nSenate, supposing that they were looking upon an assembly of kings.\"\r\n\r\nIf to these we add the names of the eminent men who were the\r\ncolleagues of the founder, and of Nathaniel Niles, Jonathan Freeman,\r\nThomas W. Thompson, Stephen Jacob, Timothy Farrar, Samuel Bell, Asa\r\nMcFarland, Seth Payson, Samuel Prentiss, George Sullivan, John Aiken,\r\nWilliam Reed, Samuel Delano, Samuel Fletcher, Nathaniel Bouton, Silas\r\nAiken, Joel Parker, Richard Fletcher, and the honored Governors of the\r\nState, we are fully impressed with the fact that the interests of the\r\ncollege have been in the keeping of wise and prudent guardians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nLABORS OF DARTMOUTH ALUMNI.--CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Dartmouth was founded as an evangelizing agency, and every stone\r\nwas laid in firm reliance upon Him to whom all was consecrated, there\r\nwas good ground of hope that it would be a strong and durable pillar\r\nin the great temple of Christian learning. Its record is a realization\r\nof the hopes of its noble and devoted founders.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Narrative\" for 1771 (p. 29) Dr. Wheelock, alluding to the\r\nperiod immediately following his removal to Hanover, says: \"there were\r\nevident impressions upon the minds of a number of my family and school\r\nwhich soon became universal, insomuch that scarcely one remained who\r\ndid not feel a greater or less degree of it, till the whole lump\r\nseemed to be leavened by it, and love, peace, joy; satisfaction and\r\ncontentment reigned through the whole. The 23d day of January (1771)\r\nwas kept as a day of solemn fasting and prayer, on which I gathered a\r\nchurch in this college and school, which consisted of twenty-seven\r\nmembers.\"\r\n\r\nHis biographer, writing early in the present century, says: \"The\r\ncollege has been repeatedly favored with remarkable religious\r\nimpressions on the minds of the students. These showers of divine\r\ngrace have produced streams which have refreshed the garden of the\r\nLord, and made glad the city of our God. The young men in this school\r\nof the prophets have, at these seasons, been powerfully and lastingly\r\naffected; they have gone forth as 'angels of the churches;' the work\r\nof God has prospered in their hands; many of their people have been\r\nturned to righteousness.\"\r\n\r\nOf President Tyler's administration it is said that the most\r\nremarkable thing was \"a powerful revival of religion.\" All the later\r\ndecades have been marked by manifestations of the Divine presence in\r\nthe college. Scarcely a year has passed in which some of its members\r\nhave not joyfully consecrated intellect and heart and life to the\r\nservice of Him who gave them.\r\n\r\nNot a few have been \"bright and shining lights\" in the church. Of\r\nJesse Appleton, Rev. Dr. Anderson says: \"I have been placed in\r\ncircumstances to see much of not a few great men in the Church of\r\nChrist, but I have been conversant with only a few, a very few, whose\r\nattributes of power seemed to me quite equal to his. The clearness of\r\nhis conceptions was almost angelic. If I am fitted to do any good in\r\nthe world, I owe what intellectual adaptation I have very much to his\r\nadmirable training, especially as he took us through his favorite\r\nButler.\"\r\n\r\nFew American divines have had a wider or more varied sphere of\r\ninfluence than Dr. Appleton's classmate, Ebenezer Porter, a _pioneer_\r\nin sacred Rhetoric, one of the originators of the American Tract\r\nSociety, the most prominent of the founders of the American Education\r\nSociety, which he adopted as his child and heir, the beloved and\r\nhonored first president of the oldest Theological Seminary in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nOf Samuel Worcester, the distinguished opponent of Channing, we have\r\nthe following valuable record: \"When the American Board of\r\nCommissioners for Foreign Missions was formed, his labors as the\r\nCorresponding Secretary, with the whole system now in operation for\r\nthe conduct of missions abroad, required the same processes of\r\noriginal evolution and determination of principles and rules, as so\r\nsignally characterized the formation of our Federal government. Here\r\nwas displayed his peculiar, if we may not say his transcendent, power\r\namong his eminent associates. The great value of 'the Constitution of\r\nthe Board, as a working instrument,' 'the nicely adjusted relations of\r\nthe voluntary and ecclesiastical principles,' the 'origination of what\r\nis peculiarly excellent in the Annual Reports, and also in the\r\nInstructions to Missionaries,' and the '_American_ idea' of\r\n'organizing the missions as self-governing communities,' are justly\r\nascribed to him by the present senior Secretary, [Dr. Anderson] as\r\nconclusive witness of his extraordinary 'sagacity' and of his being\r\nfar 'in advance of the age.'\"\r\n\r\nPhilander Chase could found parish and diocese and seminary with equal\r\nfacility, performing a work for the Episcopal Church in America\r\nunrivaled by that of any contemporary.\r\n\r\nNor should we overlook such names as Asa Burton, teacher of teachers\r\nin theology, who could successfully measure swords with Emmons; Samuel\r\nWood, whose impress never left the mind of Webster; Daniel Story, a\r\npioneer of Marietta; Mase Shepard, Jonathan Strong, Walter Harris,\r\nEthan Smith, Alvan Hyde, William Jackson, Rufus Anderson, the honored\r\nfather of a not less honored son; John Fiske, Abijah Wines, Eliphalet\r\nGillett, whose home missionary zeal in Maine made a lasting impression\r\nupon the rising state; Kiah Bailey, who first effectually moved the\r\nsprings which gave to the same State the Bangor Theological Seminary;\r\nJohn Smith, an earnest and honored teacher in that Seminary;\r\nTheophilus Packard, whose pupils have performed honorable service for\r\nthe Master in both hemispheres; Peter P. Roots, Bezaleel Pinneo, Asa\r\nMcFarland, Caleb Jewett Tenney, a leading founder of the East Windsor\r\n(now Hartford) Theological Seminary; Thomas A. Merrill, Abraham\r\nBurnham, George T. Chapman, John Brown, Daniel Poor, the pioneer in\r\nChristian learning in Ceylon and Madura; Austin Dickinson, to whom the\r\nworld is under large obligations for a higher type of periodical\r\nliterature; Levi Spaulding, the worthy coadjutor of Poor; Nathan W.\r\nFiske, Daniel Temple, who carried the first missionary printing-press\r\nto Western Asia, and made for classic lands a Christian literature;\r\nWilliam Goodell, the leading founder of two flourishing Christian\r\nmissions on heathen soil, and the translator of the whole Bible into\r\nthe Armeno-Turkish language; Ephraim W. Clark, John S. Emerson, and\r\nAustin H. Wright, of similar spirit; Benjamin Woodbury, Aaron Foster,\r\na leading founder of the American Home Missionary Society, and John K.\r\nLord, whose early death in the Queen City of the West, was as the\r\nfalling of \"a standard-bearer.\"\r\n\r\nTo these we might add many eminent living heralds of the cross, and a\r\nHovey and a Townsend in leading Theological Seminaries. We cannot more\r\nfitly close on this head than by remarking that of the last forty-four\r\nsubjects in the second volume of Sprague's invaluable \"Annals of the\r\nPulpit,\" eleven were Dartmouth alumni, while all the others, save\r\neight, numbered her alumni among their teachers.\r\n\r\nDartmouth has an honorable record in the various departments of Law\r\nand in statesmanship. Most naturally we dwell upon the name of Daniel\r\nWebster, towering in strength and grandeur, like the mountain beside\r\nwhich he was born, amid the surrounding granite, who left the impress\r\nof his genius upon the jurisprudence of his native State, upon the\r\nConstitution of his adopted State, and upon nearly every conspicuous\r\npage of America's civil or political history for half a century; who\r\nloved Plymouth Rock and Bunker Hill with an undying affection,\r\ndwelling alternately beside the one or the other; who cherished as the\r\napple of his eye his Alma Mater and the nation for whose service she\r\nhad prepared him; who in early life and middle life and old age\r\nadvocated the universal brotherhood of man, whether pleading in behalf\r\nof the oppressed African, or the oppressed Greek, or the oppressed\r\nHungarian; who gave all his sympathy and all his influence in aid of\r\nevery pursuit, enterprise, and institution which could ennoble the\r\nhuman race; who made all other human law pay homage to the\r\nConstitution of his country, and all human law to the Divine\r\nRevelation; who gave to Dartmouth a more enduring fame throughout\r\nAmerica, and to America a more enduring fame over the whole earth: of\r\nLevi Woodbury, who as Governor of his native State clearly\r\ncomprehended and carefully regarded its various interests; as a\r\nSenator commanded the profound respect of the National Legislature; as\r\na Cabinet minister, inaugurated \"a series of reforms which pervaded\r\nthe whole department, and penetrated to every branch of the service,\"\r\nand who upon the Supreme Bench of the United States gave judicial\r\nopinions which are \"monuments of patient research, ripe, and rarely\r\nerring judgment, enlarged and liberal views, and eminent attainments:\"\r\nof Thaddeus Stevens, of whom his biographer says: \"Thoroughly radical\r\nin all his views, hating slavery with all the intensity of his\r\nnature, believing it just, right, and expedient, not only to\r\nemancipate the negro but to arm him and make him a soldier, and\r\nafterward to make him a citizen, and give him the ballot, he led off\r\nin all measures for effecting these ends. The Emancipation\r\nProclamation was urged upon the President by him, on all grounds of\r\nright, justice, and expediency; the Fourteenth Amendment to the\r\nConstitution was initiated and pressed by him:\" of Rufus Choate, who\r\ncombined in more majestic and graceful proportions than any other\r\nAmerican lawyer, the ripe scholar and the successful advocate; who\r\nwith the beauty and power of his language could captivate a jury, a\r\npopular audience, or the American Congress with equal facility; who\r\ngave to English literature some of its most brilliant gems, and who in\r\nhis immortal eulogy upon Webster, in the opinion of competent judges,\r\ngave to the world one of the most finished and impressive examples of\r\nelegiac eloquence to which it has listened since the days of Pericles:\r\nand of Salmon P. Chase, who, when our government needed, gave to it\r\nthe \"sinews of war,\" and in the eloquent language of Evarts, \"Whether\r\nby interposing his strong arm to save Mr. Birney from the fury of a\r\nmob; or by his bold and constant maintenance in the courts of the\r\ncause of fugitive slaves, in the face of the resentments of the public\r\nopinion of the day; or by his fearless desertion of all reigning\r\npolitics to lead a feeble band of protestants through the wilderness\r\nof anti-slavery wanderings, its pillar of cloud by day, its pillar of\r\nfire by night; or, as Governor of Ohio, facing the intimidations of\r\nthe Slave States, backed by Federal power and a storm of popular\r\npassion; or in consolidating the triumphant politics on the urgent\r\nissue which was to flame out into rebellion and revolt; or in his\r\nserene predominance, during the trial of the President, over the rage\r\nof party hate which brought into peril the coördination of the great\r\ndepartments of government, and threatened its whole frame,--in all\r\nthese marked instances of public duty, as in the simple routine of his\r\nordinary conduct, Mr. Chase asked but one question to determine his\r\ncourse of action,--'Is it right?'\"\r\n\r\nNor should we forget others who have left a lasting impression upon\r\nthe jurisprudence of New England, and indeed our whole country. Among\r\nthem Samuel S. Wilde, who had few peers as an advocate in Maine, or as\r\na judge in Massachusetts; Ezekiel Webster, who as lawyer and statesman\r\nleft a monument in New Hampshire which shall never crumble; Richard\r\nFletcher, \"whose legal acumen, clear, distinct, and precise statement,\r\nclosely reasoned argument, and conscientious mastery of his subject,\r\nadorned the bench no less than the bar;\" Joseph Bell, who as advocate\r\nand legislator, in ability as in station, towered above most of his\r\nassociates; Ichabod Bartlett, \"the Randolph of the North,\" who could\r\nmeasure swords with Mason or Webster or Clay, without either shield or\r\nshame; and Joel Parker, who honored alike the bar, the bench, and the\r\nlecture-room.\r\n\r\nAs members of one branch or the other of our National Legislature, we\r\nrecord other honored names in alphabetical order:\r\n\r\nSamuel C. Allen, who voted _alone_ in his place in Congress, in favor\r\nof suffrage without regard to color. Helium Allen, Lemuel H. Arnold,\r\nSamuel Bell, Samuel N. Bell, Silas Betton, Abijah Bigelow, John\r\nBlanchard, Daniel Breck, Elijah Brigham, David Brunson, Joseph Buffum,\r\nDudley Chase, Daniel Chipman, Martin Chittenden, Daniel Clark, in\r\nevery public position a leading spirit, Judah Dana, Samuel Dinsmoor,\r\nDaniel M. Durell, Ira A. Eastman, Thomas M. Edwards, Walbridge A.\r\nField, Benjamin F. Flanders, Isaac Fletcher, George G. Fogg, Sylvester\r\nGilbert, Calvin Goddard, Daniel W. Gooch, John N. Goodwin, George\r\nGrennell, James W. Grimes, pioneer statesman of the far West, Matthew\r\nHarvey, Henry Hibbard, Henry Hubbard, a man of rare abilities and\r\ninfluence, Jonathan Hunt, Luther Jewett, Joseph S. Lyman, Asa Lyon,\r\nRufus McIntire, Charles Marsh, George P. Marsh, the honored son of an\r\nhonored father, Gilman Marston, Ebenezer Mattoon, Jeremiah Nelson,\r\nMoses Norris, John Noyes, Benjamin Orr, Albion K. Parris, James W.\r\nPatterson, whose eminent abilities and elaborate culture have placed\r\nhim in the foremost rank of the present generation of New England\r\nstatesmen, Charles H. Peaslee, Edward C. Reed, Erastus Root, Joseph\r\nRichardson, Eleazer W. Ripley, equally fearless as a soldier and a\r\nstatesman, Ether Shepley, alike conspicuous for mental and moral\r\npowers, John S. Sherburne, George A. Simmons, who by his own efforts\r\nattained rare eminence, Peleg Sprague, Samuel Taggart, Amos Tuck, a\r\npioneer in philanthropic politics, John Wentworth, who in large\r\nmeasure maintains the reputation of an ancient and honored family,\r\nPhineas White, Leonard Wilcox, Charles W. Willard, Hezekiah Williams,\r\nand William Wilson. To which should be added the names of James C.\r\nAlvord and Sylvanus Backus, who were elected to Congress, but did not\r\nlive to take their seats.\r\n\r\nWhen Daniel Webster entered the American Senate, five of its twelve\r\nNew England representatives were Dartmouth alumni. Their labors in\r\nCongress form a part of the history of every Administration of our\r\nNational government.\r\n\r\nAmos Kendall, beside large usefulness, in other spheres, was an\r\nhonored Cabinet Minister.\r\n\r\nAmos T. Akerman has been similarly honored, as Attorney General of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe names of Charles B. Haddock, George P. Marsh, George G. Fogg, and\r\nEdward F. Noyes, deserve honorable mention in connection with public\r\nservice abroad.\r\n\r\nThe names of Samuel Dinsmoor, the younger, John Hubbard, Ralph\r\nMetcalf, Peter T. Washburn, Nelson Dingley, and Benjamin F. Prescott\r\nshould be noticed, as State Governors, in addition to several who have\r\nadded this honor to others, of which we have already made mention.\r\n\r\nIn Judicial life many names attract our notice beside those, which\r\nhave been mentioned in other connections; among them Nicholas Baylies,\r\nNicholas Emery, Nathan Weston, Ira Perley, Jonas Cutting, Benjamin W.\r\nBonney, Isaac F. Redfield, Robert R. Heath, Andrew S. Woods, William\r\nH. Bartlett, John S. Sanborn, and Benjamin H. Steele, of the deceased,\r\nand William G. Woodward, Timothy P. Redfield, George F. Shepley, James\r\nBarrett, Jason Downer, Jonathan E. Sargent, Lincoln F. Brigham, Oliver\r\nMiller, and Charles Doe, among the living. Nor should we forget that\r\nof living members of the American Bar few names have been honored more\r\nin the East than that of Charles B. Goodrich, and few names have been\r\nhonored more in the West than that of James F. Joy.\r\n\r\nDartmouth has contributed largely to American Education.\r\n\r\nBowdoin's first two presidents were Joseph McKeen and Jesse Appleton.\r\n\r\nThomas C. Upham was one of its honored Faculty for more than forty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nOren B. Cheney was a leading founder of Bates College, in later years.\r\n\r\nJames Marsh, John Wheeler, and Joseph Torrey were successively\r\npresidents of Vermont University, and each left upon it a most\r\nvaluable and durable impression.\r\n\r\nWilliam Jackson and Thomas A. Merrill inscribed their names indelibly\r\nupon the foundations of Middlebury College, which numbers Benjamin\r\nLabaree and Calvin B. Hulbert among its honored presidents.\r\n\r\nZephaniah S. Moore, as president of Williams College, gave to it the\r\nfruits of his valuable experience at Dartmouth, and materially\r\nenhanced its usefulness; nor should we omit the name of its earnest\r\nfriend and guardian, Alvan Hyde.\r\n\r\nIn naming the leading founders of Amherst College, Professor Tyler\r\ndoes not hesitate to place first, Rufus Graves, and next, Samuel F.\r\nDickinson. The value of Dr. Moore's services as first president has\r\nbeen referred to in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\nA record of its obligations to Professor Nathan Welby Fiske is a\r\nmaterial part of its history.\r\n\r\nThe biographer of George Ticknor says no one contributed more than he\r\ntoward the impulse which has resulted in Harvard's progress during the\r\nlast half century.\r\n\r\nAmos Kendall was the honored founder of the College for Deaf Mutes at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Sturtevant has an honored place in the history of education\r\nfor the Blind in the South.\r\n\r\nJonathan P. Cushing resuscitated Hampden Sydney College when life was\r\nnearly extinct, and made it again \"a power in the land.\"\r\n\r\nPhilander Chase, in founding Kenyon and Jubilee Colleges, gave to the\r\nEpiscopalians of the West two of their leading literary institutions.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Ellis founded Illinois College, which, with the influences\r\nthat centered around it, in large measure \"gave character\" to the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nNot less plainly did he write his name upon the foundations of Wabash\r\nCollege, and not less plainly have Charles White, Edmund D. Hovey, and\r\nCaleb Mills written their names upon the superstructure.\r\n\r\nA proper estimate of the valuable labors of Joseph Estabrook, Stephen\r\nFoster, and George Cooke, successively presidents of the College of\r\nEast Tennessee, can only be made by those who are familiar with the\r\nhistory of the institution.\r\n\r\nDrury College, so admirably located, bears the impress of Nathan J.\r\nMorrison.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Rocky Mountains, Samuel H. Willey and George H. Atkinson\r\nwill ever be honored among the leading founders and guardians of the\r\nCollege of California, and the Pacific University.\r\n\r\nNo history of American education will be complete which does not\r\nportray the earnest and valuable labors, in numerous other collegiate\r\ninstitutions East, West, North, and South, of a long roll of Dartmouth\r\nalumni; among them, beside many others, already noticed, Joseph Dana,\r\nJames Dean, Josiah Noyes, Frederick Hall, George T. Chapman, James\r\nHadley, Rufus W. Bailey, Benjamin F. Farnsworth, George Bush, Cyrus P.\r\nGrosvenor, Oramel S. Hinckley, Samuel Hurd, Caleb S. Henry, John\r\nKendrick, Charles D. Cleaveland, Leonard Marsh, Forrest Shepherd,\r\nCharles B. Dana, Nathaniel S. Folsom, Jarvis Gregg, Milo P. Jewett,\r\nDiarca H. Allen, Kendrick Metcalf, Jacob H. Quimby, John B. Niles,\r\nDaniel F. Richardson, Amos Brown, Calvin Tracy, John C. Webster,\r\nEdmund Q. S. Waldron, Augustus Everett, Erastus Everett, Jonas De F.\r\nRichards, Abner H. Brown, Henry L. Bullen, George P. Comings, David\r\nDimond, Charles H. Churchill, Amos B. Goodhue, Joshua J. Blaisdell,\r\nArtemas W. Sawyer, Mark Bailey, Gideon Draper, Joseph O. Hudnut, Henry\r\nE. J. Boardman, Charles S. Farrar, Nathan S. Lincoln, John Ordronaux,\r\nJohn M. Hayes, Daniel Putnam, Martin H. Fisk, Isaac A. Parker, Ephraim\r\nMarch, William E. Barnard, Ambrose W. Clarke, Amos N. Currier, Richard\r\nC. Stanley, Albert S. Bickmore, George S. Morris, and John W.\r\nScribner. It is hardly possible to overestimate the influence of these\r\nmen in shaping the thought and life of our country.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to academies we find that Mark Newman, Osgood Johnson, and\r\nSamuel H. Taylor, especially the two latter, were largely instrumental\r\nin placing Phillips Academy, at Andover, at the head of such\r\ninstitutions in America. Few schools of the kind have a more brilliant\r\nrecord than Kimball Union Academy, and few American educators have\r\nacquired more permanent renown than Cyrus S. Richards.\r\n\r\nThe labors of Amos J. Cook at Fryeburg, of John Vose at Atkinson and\r\nPembroke, of Andrew Mack at Gilmanton and Haverhill, of John Hubbard\r\nat New Ipswich, of Ezra Carter at Peacham, of Clement Long and William\r\nNutting at Randolph, of James K. Colby at St. Johnsbury, of Ebenezer\r\nAdams at Leicester, of Proctor Pierce at Deerfield, of Caleb Butler at\r\nGroton, and Benjamin Greenleaf at Bradford, constitute a vital portion\r\nof the history of academic education in New England. Nor must we\r\nforget that such men as Albert C. Perkins, at Exeter, C. F. P.\r\nBancroft, at Andover, and Homer T. Fuller, at St. Johnsbury, are still\r\nlaboring in this important sphere, while Hiram Orcutt is performing\r\nvaluable service in a somewhat similar sphere at West Lebanon.\r\nWorcester Free Institute is under large obligations to Charles O.\r\nThompson and John E. Sinclair.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the metropolis of New England we find that John D.\r\nPhilbrick has made her schools and school-houses in their leading\r\nfeatures models for a world, fit successor to Elisha Ticknor, the\r\nleading founder of her primary schools, and Caleb Bingham and John\r\nPark, who in large measure revolutionized female education in America.\r\n\r\nBeaumont Parks taught successfully for forty years in Indiana and\r\nIllinois; Charles E. Hovey founded the Illinois Normal School--worthy\r\nfollowers of Daniel Story at Marietta, the pioneer professional\r\nteacher of the West.\r\n\r\nJohn Eaton, as Commissioner of General Education, has stamped his\r\nname, indelibly, upon our country's history.\r\n\r\nIn Literature, Dartmouth has a worthy record.\r\n\r\nIn Philosophy, the names of James Marsh, Thomas C. Upham, and Caleb S.\r\nHenry, command universal respect.\r\n\r\nIn History, the names of George Ticknor, Joseph B. Felt, Joseph Tracy,\r\nGeorge Punchard, Samuel Hopkins, John Lord, and Edwin D. Sanborn, will\r\nlive as long as our language.\r\n\r\nIn Scientific popular literature, the names of Abel Curtis, who is\r\nbelieved to have given to America its first English Grammar in a\r\nseparate and distinct form, of Caleb Bingham, who followed in his\r\nfootsteps and enhanced the value of his work, of Daniel Adams, who\r\ngave to the world the invaluable Arithmetic, of Benjamin Greenleaf,\r\nwhose mathematical works have added materially to the usefulness of\r\nhis long and busy life, of Charles D. Cleaveland and Alphonso Wood,\r\nare stars of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\nIn Periodical literature, the names of John Park, David Everett,\r\nThomas G. Fessenden, Asa Rand, Russell Jarvis, Absalom Peters,\r\nNathaniel P. Rogers, Ebenezer C. Tracy, Amasa Converse, Henry Wood,\r\nNathaniel S. Folsom, Alonzo H. Quint, and Henry A. Hazen, deserve\r\nespecial notice.\r\n\r\nIn Polite literature, the names of Nathaniel H. Carter, Charles B.\r\nHaddock, Rufus Choate, George P. Marsh, Richard B. Kimball, and John\r\nB. Bouton, command universal admiration.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Samuel L. Knapp, Henry Bond, and Nathan Crosby are\r\nvaluable contributions to American Biography.\r\n\r\nIn Professional and Classic literature, the alumni of Dartmouth have\r\ndone a good work. We can only glance at leading names, many of which\r\nhave been mentioned in their more appropriate places. Among them are\r\nAsa Burton, Jesse Appleton, Ebenezer Porter, Samuel C. Bartlett, Alvah\r\nHovey, Luther T. Townsend, Isaac F. Redfield, Silas Durkee, Edmund R.\r\nPeaslee, W. W. Morland, F. E. Oliver, Jabez B. Upham, Edward H.\r\nParker, Joseph Torrey, Nathan W. Fiske, George Bush, and Alpheus\r\nCrosby.\r\n\r\nIn Industrial literature, the names of Henry Colman and John L. Hayes\r\nwill be honored so long as agriculture and manufactures shall have a\r\nprominent place among human pursuits.\r\n\r\nIn Medicine, a goodly proportion of her most eminent sons have given\r\nto Dartmouth their personal services as teachers; we have only to\r\nrecall in this connection the honored names recorded in a preceding\r\nchapter,--Mussey, Perkins, Crosby, and Peaslee. But other names claim\r\nour notice. Amos Twitchell, by tireless industry and fidelity in his\r\nregular professional work, and his boldness and skill as an operative\r\nsurgeon, gained a reputation equaled by few in New England, and\r\nextending to the Old World. The name of George C. Shattuck shines with\r\nequal lustre, as the benefactor of his Alma Mater, and the friend of\r\nsuffering humanity in the metropolis of New England.\r\n\r\nLuther V. Bell wrote his name as plainly upon the foundations of the\r\nMcLean Asylum, at Somerville, as did his honored father, Samuel Bell,\r\nupon the jurisprudence of New Hampshire. The name of John E. Tyler is\r\nscarcely less conspicuous upon the superstructure.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey will never forget her obligations to Lyndon A. Smith for\r\nthe earnest efforts which gave to that State a similar institution.\r\nNor should we be silent in regard to the services of living men who\r\nare now conducting or prominently connected with similar institutions;\r\namong them, Jesse P. Bancroft, Clement A. Walker, John Ordronaux,\r\nHomer O. Hitchcock, William W. Godding, and John P. Brown.\r\n\r\nAs Medical lecturers, we cannot fail to notice other honored names;\r\namong them, Josiah Noyes, Joseph A. Gallup, James Hadley, Jesse Smith,\r\nArthur L. Porter, Gilman Kimball, Benjamin R. Palmer, Noah Worcester,\r\nAbner Hartwell Brown, Nathan S. Lincoln, and Phineas S. Conner.\r\n\r\nA reference to all the living medical alumni of Dartmouth, who are\r\nacting the part of useful practitioners or teachers, added to the\r\nabove, would take us to nearly every leading medical institution, and\r\nnearly every family, in our broad land.\r\n\r\nIn Productive industry and the development of our national resources,\r\nthe alumni of Dartmouth have an honorable place.\r\n\r\nEastern New England will never be unmindful of her obligations to\r\nWilliam A. Hayes, for his successful efforts to introduce a better\r\ngrade of wool than had ever before been produced in that region; nor\r\nwill the country or the world forget their obligations to his honored\r\nclassmate, Henry Colman, the American pioneer in scientific\r\nagriculture. The names of Thomas G. Fessenden and Amos Brown also\r\ndeserve notice in this connection.\r\n\r\nPetroleum, instead of being at the present time a leading American\r\nproduct, might have remained, in large measure, in its ancient bed,\r\nbut for the skillful, persevering enterprise of George H. Bissell and\r\nFrancis B. Brewer.\r\n\r\nIn Railroad enterprise, the names of Erastus Hopkins, Thomas M.\r\nEdwards, and Francis Cogswell, in the East, and James F. Joy, in the\r\nWest, are \"familiar as household words.\"\r\n\r\nThe sons of Dartmouth have performed honorable service in the field.\r\nMore than a score were soldiers of the Revolution. Among them John S.\r\nSherburne, who lost one of his limbs; Absalom Peters, whose efficient\r\nservice in Vermont contributed largely to the protection of our\r\nNorthern frontier; and Ebenezer Mattoon, who by forced marches with\r\nhis gallant men furnished cannon which \"told\" at Saratoga.\r\n\r\nIn the War of 1812-1815 they acted well their part. Eleazer Wheelock\r\nRipley, at Lundy's Lane, after General Scott had been disabled (with\r\nthe aid of the gallant Miller), wrested victory from an almost\r\ntriumphant foe, on the bloodiest field of the war.\r\n\r\nIn that War, too, Sylvanus Thayer gained a measure of the renown which\r\nhas rendered the name of the most efficient founder of the Military\r\nAcademy at West Point illustrious in both hemispheres.\r\n\r\nIn the late War one of the most valuable coadjutors of two of its\r\nleading captains--Grant and Sherman--was Joseph Dana Webster.\r\n\r\nIn letters of living light we write many other names, among them\r\nCharles and Daniel Foster--par nobile fratrum--Samuel Souther, Charles\r\nAugustine Davis, Isaac Lewis Clarke, Calvin Gross Hollenbush,\r\nValentine B. Oakes, Franklin Aretas Haskell, Arthur Edwin Hutchins,\r\nLucius Stearns Shaw, Horace Meeker Dyke, Edwin Brant Frost, William\r\nLawrence Baker, Charles Whiting Carroll, George Washington Quimby,\r\nGeorge Ephraim Chamberlin, Charles Lee Foster, Henry Mills Caldwell,\r\nand Stark Fellows, who at Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, the\r\nWilderness, Cold Harbor, and elsewhere, gave their lives in defense of\r\nthe American Union.\r\n\r\nNo aggregation of volumes would adequately portray the whole work of\r\nDartmouth's alumni. In quiet places, the great majority, day by day,\r\nand year by year, have performed their allotted tasks. In such places\r\nall over America, and in other lands, they have built their most\r\nenduring monuments. The calm lustre of their lives is almost as widely\r\ndiffused as the morning light.\r\n\r\nEleazer Wheelock founded the college, in faith and hope, for the\r\nenlightenment and evangelization of future generations in that mighty\r\nstorehouse of thought and action, central New England.\r\n\r\nJohn Wheelock carried forward the work with energy and zeal, and a\r\nlarge measure of success.\r\n\r\nFrancis Brown gave a valuable life for the protection of his still\r\nyouthful Alma Mater.\r\n\r\nDaniel Dana was a man of kindred spirit, and not less devoted to his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBennet Tyler magnified his office, and, laboring in season and out of\r\nseason, added \"goodly ornaments.\"\r\n\r\nNathan Lord added new halls, new departments and modes of instruction,\r\ngave larger prestige, and left the impress of a great mind upon two\r\nthousand pupils.\r\n\r\nAsa D. Smith added yet other halls, secured new endowments, and\r\nprovided a long line of scholarships, for the development of latent\r\ntalent, and the encouragement of genuine worth.\r\n\r\nSamuel C. Bartlett brings to the accomplishment of his task the name\r\nof an ancient and honored family, and the experiences of an earnest\r\nand fruitful life.\r\n\r\nDartmouth has blessed New England and Old England, North America and\r\nthe whole world.\r\n\r\nHer location, unrivaled in many respects by that of any sister\r\ninstitution, her history, so full of romance and of reality, and her\r\nwork, recorded first in the history of the eighteenth century, and\r\nindelibly impressed upon the history of the nineteenth, all warrant\r\nthe hope that her walls may stand, through all the ages of the future,\r\nstrong as the everlasting hills, and beautiful as the celestial dome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LIST OF THE ENGLISH SUBSCRIBERS TO DR.

To encourage literature indicates a great mind; to\r\ncivilize savages, with a view to their eternal happiness, evinces a\r\ngoodness of heart and a charitable disposition truly commendable;\r\nwhoever attempts it has a right to claim the assistance of every\r\nworthy member of society.

I could say much of the advantages that\r\nwould accrue from fixing the School near this city, but as you have\r\ndoubtless considered this affair with attention, you will have\r\nanticipated all I could say on the subject. I shall only remark that I\r\nhave observed with much satisfaction that the morals of my\r\nfellow-citizens are much less vitiated than those of other cities that\r\nhave an immediate foreign trade, and consequently import the vices of\r\nother climes; to this, give me leave to add, that a becoming economy\r\nis what characterizes our people, and may, by way of example, have a\r\nvery good effect on the Indian children, and such others as might be\r\nallowed to take their education in the proposed seminary.\r\n\r\n\"Should you, however, reverend sir, after receiving the proposals of\r\nthe corporation, think them inadequate to the advantages the city\r\nwould receive, or should you, for reasons that do not occur to me,\r\nthink a more remote situation more eligible (which I wish may not be),\r\nI then, sir, will make an offer, to forward the charity. But though I\r\nhave already fixed on the proposals I intend to make, I must yet\r\ndeclare that those that I am told the city intends to offer appear to\r\nme to have the advantage in point of fulfilling the intentions of the\r\ngentlemen at home, but perhaps it may be thought otherwise, and I be\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever, sir, this or your other affairs may call you into this\r\ncounty, I shall be extremely glad to show you any civilities in my\r\npower, and beg you will make my house your home, where I try to keep\r\nup to the good old adage, 'to welcome the coming and to speed the\r\ngoing guest.'\r\n\r\n    \"I am, with much respect, reverend sir,\r\n    Your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n    \"To the Rev.

I was born a heathen in\r\nMmoyanheeunnuck, alias Mohegan, in New London, North America. My\r\nparents were altogether heathens, and I was educated by them in their\r\nheathenish notions, though there was a sermon preached to our Mohegan\r\ntribe sometimes, but our Indians regarded not the Christian religion.\r\nThey would persist in their heathenish ways, and my parents in\r\nparticular were very strong in the customs of their forefathers, and\r\nthey led a wandering life up and down in the wilderness, for my father\r\nwas a great hunter. Thus I lived with them till I was sixteen years\r\nold, and then there was a great stir of religion in these parts of the\r\nworld both amongst the Indians as well as the English, and about this\r\ntime I began to think about the Christian religion, and was under\r\ngreat trouble of mind for some time. I thought the religion which I\r\nheard at this time was a new thing among mankind, such as they never\r\nheard the like before, so ignorant was I, and when I was seventeen\r\nyears of age I received a hope, and as I begun to think about\r\nreligion, so I began to learn to read, though I went to no school till\r\nI was in my nineteenth year, and then I went to the Rev. Mr.\r\nWheelock's to learning, and spent four years there, and was very\r\nweakly most of the time; this is the true account of my education.\r\n\r\n    Samson Occom.\r\n\r\n    \"Boston, Nov. 28, 1765.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Occom spent the closing years of a useful life at Brotherton, N.\r\nY., where he died, in 1792, aged nearly seventy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"A List of Charity Scholars (in Rev.

My. annually as a salary to be paid one\r\nhalf in money and the other half in money or in such necessary\r\narticles for a family as wheat, Indian corn, rye, beef, pork, mutton,\r\nbutter, cheese, hay, pasturing, etc., as long as he shall continue\r\nprofessor as aforesaid, and that he shall have these articles\r\ndelivered to him at the same price for which they were usually sold\r\nbefore the commencement of the present war in America, viz.: that he\r\nshall have wheat at 5s. per bushel, rye at 3s., Indian corn at 2s.\r\n6d., fresh beef at 3d. per lb., salt beef at 4-1/2d., fresh pork at\r\n4-1/2d., salt do. at 7d., fresh beef at 18s. per ct., do. pork at\r\n25s., mutton at 3d. per lb., butter at 3d., cheese at 3d., bread at\r\n2d., hay at 30s. per ton, pasturing per season for horse 30s., for cow\r\n20s., and also to give him one acre of land near the College for a\r\nbuilding spot, a deed of which he promises to give him whenever he\r\nshall request the same. Doctor Wheelock also agrees that Mr. Smith's\r\nsalary, viz.: one hundred pounds annually, shall not be diminished\r\nwhen his business as professor shall be so great that it will render\r\nit impracticable for him to serve as a tutor to a class in College;\r\nand that Mr. Smith shall not be removed from his professorship except\r\nthe Trustees of Dartmouth College shall judge him incapacitated\r\ntherefor, and also that Mr. Smith's salary shall begin with the date\r\nhereof. Doctor Wheelock also promises to lay this agreement before the\r\nTrustees of Dartmouth College to be confirmed by them at their next\r\nmeeting. Mr. Smith also promises that whenever he shall have a\r\nsufficient support from any fund established for the maintenance of a\r\nprofessor of languages, he will give up the salary to which the\r\nagreement entitles him.\r\n\r\n\"In testimony whereof, we have hereunto interchangeably affixed our\r\nhands and seals this 9th day of November, 1777.\r\n\r\n    \"Eleazar Wheelock.

Nathaniel Whitaker, now Doctor in Divinity, to go over to England\r\nfor that purpose, and sent over with him the Rev. Sampson Occom, an\r\nIndian minister, who had been educated by the said Wheelock. And to\r\nenable the said Whitaker, to the more successful performance of said\r\nwork on which he was sent, said Wheelock gave him a full power of\r\nattorney, by which said Whitaker solicited those worthy and generous\r\ncontributors to the charity, viz. the Right Hon. William Earl of\r\nDartmouth, the Hon. Sir Sidney Stafford Smythe, Knight, one of the\r\nBarons of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, John Thornton, of Clapham,\r\nin the county of Surrey, Esq., Samuel Roffey, of Lincoln's Innfields,\r\nin the county of Middlesex, Esq., Charles Hardey, of the parish of St.\r\nMary-le-bonne, in said county, Esq., Daniel West, of Christ's Church,\r\nSpitalfields, in the county aforesaid, Esq., Samuel Savage, of the\r\nsame place, gentleman; Josiah Robarts, of the parish of St. Edmund the\r\nKing, Lombard Street, London, gentleman, and Robert Keen, of the\r\nparish of St. Botolph, Aldgate, London, gentleman; to receive the\r\nseveral sums of money which should be contributed, and to be trustees\r\nto the contributors to such charity: which they cheerfully agreed to.\r\n\r\nWhereupon, the said Whitaker did, by virtue of said power of attorney,\r\nconstitute and appoint the said Earl of Dartmouth, Sir Sidney Stafford\r\nSmythe, John Thornton, Samuel Roffey, Charles Hardey, and Daniel West,\r\nEsquires, and Samuel Savage, Josiah Robarts, and Robert Keen,\r\ngentlemen, to be trustees of the money which had then been\r\ncontributed, and which should by his means be contributed for said\r\npurpose; which trust they have accepted, as by their engrossed\r\ndeclaration of the same under their hands and seals, well executed\r\nfully appears, and the same hath also been ratified by a deed of\r\ntrust, well executed by said Wheelock.\r\n\r\nAnd the said Wheelock further represents, that he has, by a power of\r\nattorney, for many weighty reasons, given full power to the said\r\ntrustees, to fix upon and determine the place for said school, most\r\nsubservient to the great end in view. And to enable them\r\nunderstandingly to give the preference, the said Wheelock has laid\r\nbefore the said trustees the several offers which have been generously\r\nmade in the several governments in America to encourage and invite the\r\nsettlement of said school among them for their own private emolument,\r\nand for the increase of learning in their respective places, as well\r\nas for the furtherance of the general design in view.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas a large number of the proprietors of lands in the western\r\npart of this our province of New Hampshire, animated and excited\r\nthereto by the generous example of his Excellency their Governor, and\r\nby the liberal contributions of many noblemen and gentlemen in\r\nEngland, and especially by the consideration that such a situation\r\nwould be as convenient as any for carrying on the great design among\r\nthe Indians; and also considering that without the least impediment to\r\nthe said design, the same school may be enlarged and improved to\r\npromote learning among the English, and be a means to supply a great\r\nnumber of churches and congregations which are likely soon to be\r\nformed in that new country, with a learned and orthodox ministry, they\r\nthe said proprietors have promised large tracts of land for the uses\r\naforesaid, provided the school shall be settled in the western part of\r\nour said province.\r\n\r\nAnd they the said Right Hon. Hon. and worthy trustees before\r\nmentioned, having maturely considered the reasons and arguments in\r\nfavor of the several places proposed, have given the preference to the\r\nwestern part of our said province, lying on Connecticut river, as a\r\nsituation most convenient for said school.\r\n\r\nAnd the said Wheelock has further represented a necessity of a legal\r\nincorporation, in order to the safety and well being of said seminary,\r\nand its being capable of the tenure and disposal of lands and bequests\r\nfor the use of the same. And the said Wheelock has also represented,\r\nthat for many weighty reasons, it will be expedient, at least in the\r\ninfancy of said institution, or till it can be accommodated in that\r\nnew country, and he and his friends be able to remove and settle by\r\nand round about it, that the gentlemen whom he has already nominated\r\nin his last will (which he has transmitted to the aforesaid gentlemen\r\nof the trust in England) to be trustees in America, should be of the\r\ncorporation now proposed. And also as there are already large\r\ncollections for said school in the hands of the aforesaid gentlemen of\r\nthe trust in England, and all reason to believe from their signal\r\nwisdom, piety, and zeal, to promote the Redeemer's cause (which has\r\nalready procured for them the utmost confidence of the kingdom) we may\r\nexpect they will appoint successors in time to come, who will be men\r\nof the same spirit, whereby great good may and will accrue many ways\r\nto the institution, and much be done by their example and influence to\r\nencourage and facilitate the whole design in view; for which reasons\r\nsaid Wheelock desires that the trustees aforesaid, may be vested with\r\nall that power therein which can consist with their distance from the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nKnow ye therefore that We, considering the premises and being willing\r\nto encourage the laudable design of spreading Christian knowledge\r\namong the savages of our American wilderness. And also that the best\r\nmeans of education be established in our province of New Hampshire,\r\nfor the benefit of said province, do, of our special grace, certain\r\nknowledge and mere motion, by and with the advice of our council for\r\nsaid province, by these presents will, ordain, grant and constitute\r\nthat there be a college erected in our said province of New Hampshire,\r\nby the name of _Dartmouth College_, for the education and instruction\r\nof youths of the Indian tribes in this land, in reading, writing, and\r\nall parts of learning, which shall appear necessary and expedient, for\r\ncivilizing and christianizing the children of pagans, as well as in\r\nall liberal arts and sciences, and also of English youths, and any\r\nothers. And the trustees of said college may, and shall be, one body\r\ncorporate and politic in deed, action and name, and shall be called,\r\nnamed, and distinguished by the name of _The Trustees of Dartmouth\r\nCollege_.\r\n\r\nAnd further, We have willed, given, granted, constituted and ordained,\r\nand by this our present charter, of our special grace, certain\r\nknowledge and mere motion, with the advice aforesaid, do for us, our\r\nheirs and successors forever, will, give, grant, constitute, and\r\nordain, that there shall from henceforth and forever, be in the said\r\nDartmouth College, a body politic, consisting of Trustees of Dartmouth\r\nCollege.

And that the said corporation by the name aforesaid, shall\r\nbe able and in law capable for the use of said Dartmouth College, to\r\nhave, get, acquire, purchase, receive, hold, possess and enjoy,\r\ntenements, hereditaments, jurisdictions and franchises for themselves\r\nand their successors, in fee simple or otherwise however, and to\r\npurchase, receive, or build any house or houses, or any other\r\nbuildings, as they shall think needful and convenient for the use of\r\nsaid Dartmouth College, and in such town in the western part of our\r\nsaid province of New Hampshire, as shall, by said trustees, or the\r\nmajor part of them be agreed upon, their said agreement to be\r\nevidenced by an instrument in writing under their hands ascertaining\r\nthe same. And also to receive and dispose of any lands, goods,\r\nchattels and other things of what nature soever, for the use\r\naforesaid.

And therewith or otherwise to support and pay, as the said\r\ntrustees, or the major part of such of them as are regularly convened\r\nfor that purpose, shall agree; the president, tutors, and other\r\nofficers and ministers of said Dartmouth College, and also to pay all\r\nsuch missionaries and school masters as shall be authorized, appointed\r\nand employed by them for civilizing, Christianizing, and instructing\r\nthe Indian natives of this land, their several allowances, and also\r\ntheir respective annual salaries or allowances, and also such\r\nnecessary and contingent charges, as from time to time shall arise and\r\naccrue, relating to said Dartmouth College.

I have\r\nguessed the correct placement is after 'fundamental rules of\r\nArithmetic.'\r\n\r\nThe footnote on page 167 does not have an anchor in the text. I have\r\nguessed the correct placement is after 'were printed by them at about\r\nthe same period.'\r\n\r\nOn page 14, it is unclear what the fraction is, but the bottom number\r\nis clearly 4, so I have guessed at 1/4. \"£66 17_s._ 7-1/4_d._,\r\nlawful money.\"\r\n\r\nInconsistencies in the spelling of names in the Appendix, misspelled\r\nwords within quoted material (i.e. neccessary), and inconsistencies\r\nin hyphenated words have all been retained.\r\n\r\nInconsistencies between spelling in the text and in the Index have\r\nbeen normalized. For instance, Delancey was changed to De Lancey.",
