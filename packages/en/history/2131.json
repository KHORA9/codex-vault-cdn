Macaulay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\nHERODOTUS was born at Halicarnassus, on the southwest coast of Asia\r\nMinor, in the early part of the fifth century, B. C. Of his life we know\r\nalmost nothing, except that he spent much of it traveling, to collect\r\nthe material for his writings, and that he finally settled down at\r\nThurii, in southern Italy, where his great work was composed. He died in\r\n424 B. C.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the history of Herodotus is the struggle between the\r\nGreeks and the barbarians, which he brings down to the battle of Mycale\r\nin 479 B. C. The work, as we have it, is divided into nine books,\r\nnamed after the nine Muses, but this division is probably due to the\r\nAlexandrine grammarians. His information he gathered mainly from oral\r\nsources, as he traveled through Asia Minor, down into Egypt, round\r\nthe Black Sea, and into various parts of Greece and the neighboring\r\ncountries. The chronological narrative halts from time to time to give\r\nopportunity for descriptions of the country, the people, and their\r\ncustoms and previous history; and the political account is constantly\r\nvaried by rare tales and wonders.\r\n\r\nAmong these descriptions of countries the most fascinating to the\r\nmodern, as it was to the ancient, reader is his account of the marvels\r\nof the land of Egypt. From the priests at Memphis, Heliopolis, and the\r\nEgyptian Thebes he learned what he reports of the size of the country,\r\nthe wonders of the Nile, the ceremonies of their religion, the\r\nsacredness of their animals. He tells also of the strange ways of the\r\ncrocodile and of that marvelous bird, the Phoenix; of dress and funerals\r\nand embalming; of the eating of lotos and papyrus; of the pyramids and\r\nthe great labyrinth; of their kings and queens and courtesans.\r\n\r\nYet Herodotus is not a mere teller of strange tales. However credulous\r\nhe may appear to a modern judgment, he takes care to keep separate what\r\nhe knows by his own observation from what he has merely inferred and\r\nfrom what he has been told. He is candid about acknowledging ignorance,\r\nand when versions differ he gives both. Thus the modern scientific\r\nhistorian, with other means of corroboration, can sometimes learn from\r\nHerodotus more than Herodotus himself knew.\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence, too, that Herodotus had a philosophy of\r\nhistory. The unity which marks his work is due not only to the strong\r\nGreek national feeling running through it, the feeling that rises to a\r\nheight in such passages as the descriptions of the battles of Marathon,\r\nThermopylae, and Salamis, but also to his profound belief in Fate and\r\nin Nemesis. To his belief in Fate is due the frequent quoting of oracles\r\nand their fulfilment, the frequent references to things foreordained by\r\nProvidence. The working of Nemesis he finds in the disasters that befall\r\nmen and nations whose towering prosperity awakens the jealousy of the\r\ngods. The final overthrow of the Persians, which forms his main theme,\r\nis only one specially conspicuous example of the operation of this force\r\nfrom which human life can never free itself.\r\n\r\nBut, above all, he is the father of story-tellers. \"Herodotus is such\r\nsimple and delightful reading,\" says Jevons; \"he is so unaffected and\r\nentertaining, his story flows so naturally and with such ease that\r\nwe have a difficulty in bearing in mind that, over and above the hard\r\nwriting which goes to make easy reading there is a perpetual marvel in\r\nthe work of Herodotus. It is the first artistic work in prose that Greek\r\nliterature produced. This prose work, which for pure literary merit no\r\nsubsequent work has surpassed, than which later generations, after\r\nusing the pen for centuries, have produced no prose more easy or more\r\nreadable, this was the first of histories and of literary prose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF EGYPT\r\n\r\nBY HERODOTUS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEING THE SECOND BOOK OF HIS HISTORIES CALLED EUTERPE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Cyrus had brought his life to an end, Cambyses received the royal\r\npower in succession, being the son of Cyrus and of Cassandane the\r\ndaughter of Pharnaspes, for whose death, which came about before his\r\nown, Cyrus had made great mourning himself and also had proclaimed to\r\nall those over whom he bore rule that they should make mourning for her:\r\nCambyses, I say, being the son of this woman and of Cyrus, regarded\r\nthe Ionians and Aiolians as slaves inherited from his father; and he\r\nproceeded to march an army against Egypt, taking with him as helpers not\r\nonly other nations of which he was ruler, but also those of the Hellenes\r\nover whom he had power besides.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the Egyptians, before the time when Psammetichos became king over\r\nthem, were wont to suppose that they had come into being first of all\r\nmen; but since the time when Psammetichos having become king desired to\r\nknow what men had come into being first, they suppose that the Phrygians\r\ncame into being before themselves, but they themselves before all other\r\nmen. Now Psammetichos, when he was not able by inquiry to find out any\r\nmeans of knowing who had come into being first of all men, contrived a\r\ndevice of the following kind:--Taking two newborn children belonging to\r\npersons of the common sort he gave them to a shepherd to bring up at\r\nthe place where his flocks were, with a manner of bringing up such as\r\nI shall say, charging him namely that no man should utter any word in\r\ntheir presence, and that they should be placed by themselves in a room\r\nwhere none might come, and at the proper time he should bring them\r\nshe-goats, and when he had satisfied them with milk he should do for\r\nthem whatever else was needed. These things Psammetichos did and gave\r\nhim this charge wishing to hear what word the children would let break\r\nforth first after they had ceased from wailings without sense. And\r\naccordingly it came to pass; for after a space of two years had gone by,\r\nduring which the shepherd went on acting so, at length, when he opened\r\nthe door and entered, both children fell before him in entreaty and\r\nuttered the word _bekos_, stretching forth their hands. At first when\r\nhe heard this the shepherd kept silence; but since this word was often\r\nrepeated, as he visited them constantly and attended to them, at last\r\nhe declared the matter to his master, and at his command he brought the\r\nchildren before his face. Then Psammetichos having himself also heard\r\nit, began to inquire what nation of men named anything _bekos_, and\r\ninquiring he found that the Phrygians had this name for bread. In this\r\nmanner and guided by an indication such as this, the Egyptians were\r\nbrought to allow that the Phrygians were a more ancient people than\r\nthemselves. That so it came to pass I heard from the priests of that\r\nHephaistos who dwells at Memphis; but the Hellenes relate, besides many\r\nother idle tales, that Psammetichos cut out the tongues of certain women\r\nand then caused the children to live with these women.\r\n\r\nWith regard then to the rearing of the children they related so much as\r\nI have said: and I heard also other things at Memphis when I had speech\r\nwith the priests of Hephaistos. Moreover I visited both Thebes and\r\nHeliopolis for this very cause, namely because I wished to know whether\r\nthe priests at these places would agree in their accounts with those at\r\nMemphis; for the men of Heliopolis are said to be the most learned in\r\nrecords of the Egyptians. Those of their narrations which I heard with\r\nregard to the gods I am not earnest to relate in full, but I shall name\r\nthem only because I consider that all men are equally ignorant of these\r\nmatters: and whatever things of them I may record I shall record only\r\nbecause I am compelled by the course of the story. But as to those\r\nmatters which concern men, the priests agreed with one another in saying\r\nthat the Egyptians were the first of all men on earth to find out the\r\ncourse of the year, having divided the seasons into twelve parts to make\r\nup the whole; and this they said they found out from the stars: and they\r\nreckon to this extent more wisely than the Hellenes, as it seems to\r\nme, inasmuch as the Hellenes throw in an intercalated month every other\r\nyear, to make the seasons right, whereas the Egyptians, reckoning the\r\ntwelve months at thirty days each, bring in also every year five days\r\nbeyond number, and thus the circle of their season is completed and\r\ncomes round to the same point whence it set out. They said moreover that\r\nthe Egyptians were the first who brought into use appellations for the\r\ntwelve gods and the Hellenes took up the use from them; and that they\r\nwere the first who assigned altars and images and temples to the gods,\r\nand who engraved figures on stones; and with regard to the greater\r\nnumber of these things they showed me by actual facts that they had\r\nhappened so. They said also that the first man who became king of Egypt\r\nwas Min; and that in his time all Egypt except the district of Thebes\r\nwas a swamp, and none of the regions were then above water which now lie\r\nbelow the lake of Moiris, to which lake it is a voyage of seven days\r\nup the river from the sea: and I thought that they said well about the\r\nland; for it is manifest in truth even to a person who has not heard it\r\nbeforehand but has only seen, at least if he have understanding, that\r\nthe Egypt to which the Hellenes come in ships is a land which has been\r\nwon by the Egyptians as an addition, and that it is a gift of the river:\r\nmoreover the regions which lie above this lake also for a distance of\r\nthree days' sail, about which they did not go on to say anything of\r\nthis kind, are nevertheless another instance of the same thing: for the\r\nnature of the land of Egypt is as follows:--First when you are still\r\napproaching it in a ship and are distant a day's run from the land, if\r\nyou let down a sounding-line you will bring up mud and you will find\r\nyourself in eleven fathoms. This then so far shows that there is a\r\nsilting forward of the land. Then secondly, as to Egypt itself, the\r\nextent of it along the sea is sixty _schoines_, according to our\r\ndefinition of Egypt as extending from the Gulf of Plinthine to the\r\nSerbonian lake, along which stretches Mount Casion; from this lake then\r\nthe sixty _schoines_ are reckoned: for those of men who are poor in\r\nland have their country measured by fathoms, those who are less poor by\r\nfurlongs, those who have much land by parasangs, and those who have\r\nland in very great abundance by _schoines_: now the parasang is equal\r\nto thirty furlongs, and each _schoine_, which is an Egyptian measure, is\r\nequal to sixty furlongs. So there would be an extent of three thousand\r\nsix hundred furlongs for the coast-land of Egypt. From thence and as\r\nfar as Heliopolis inland Egypt is broad, and the land is all flat and\r\nwithout springs of water and formed of mud: and the road as one goes\r\ninland from the sea to Heliopolis is about the same in length as that\r\nwhich leads from the altar of the twelve gods at Athens to Pisa and the\r\ntemple of Olympian Zeus: reckoning up you would find the difference\r\nvery small by which these roads fail of being equal in length, not more\r\nindeed than fifteen furlongs; for the road from Athens to Pisa wants\r\nfifteen furlongs of being fifteen hundred, while the road to Heliopolis\r\nfrom the sea reaches that number completely. From Heliopolis however,\r\nas you go up, Egypt is narrow; for on the one side a mountain-range\r\nbelonging to Arabia stretches along by the side of it, going in a\r\ndirection from the North towards the midday and the South Wind, tending\r\nupwards without a break to that which is called the Erythraian Sea, in\r\nwhich range are the stone-quarries which were used in cutting stone for\r\nthe pyramids at Memphis. On this side then the mountain ends where I\r\nhave said, and then takes a turn back; and where it is widest, as I was\r\ninformed, it is a journey of two months across from East to West;\r\nand the borders of it which turn towards the East are said to produce\r\nfrankincense. Such then is the nature of this mountain-range; and on the\r\nside of Egypt towards Libya another range extends, rocky and enveloped\r\nin sand: in this are the pyramids, and it runs in the same direction\r\nas those parts of the Arabian mountains which go towards the midday. So\r\nthen, I say, from Heliopolis the land has no longer a great extent so\r\nfar as it belongs to Egypt, and for about four days' sail up the\r\nriver Egypt properly so called is narrow: and the space between the\r\nmountain-ranges which have been mentioned is plain-land, but where it is\r\nnarrowest it did not seem to me to exceed two hundred furlongs from the\r\nArabian mountains to those which are called the Libyan. After this again\r\nEgypt is broad. Such is the nature of this land: and from Heliopolis to\r\nThebes is a voyage up the river of nine days, and the distance of the\r\njourney in furlongs is four thousand eight hundred and sixty, the number\r\nof _schoines_ being eighty-one. If these measures of Egypt in furlongs\r\nbe put together, the result is as follows:--I have already before this\r\nshown that the distance along the sea amounts to three thousand six\r\nhundred furlongs, and I will now declare what the distance is inland\r\nfrom the sea to Thebes, namely six thousand one hundred and twenty\r\nfurlongs: and again the distance from Thebes to the city called\r\nElephantine is one thousand eight hundred furlongs.\r\n\r\nOf this land then, concerning which I have spoken, it seemed to myself\r\nalso, according as the priests said, that the greater part had been won\r\nas an addition by the Egyptians; for it was evident to me that the\r\nspace between the aforesaid mountain-ranges, which lie above the city\r\nof Memphis, once was a gulf of the sea, like the regions about Ilion and\r\nTeuthrania and Ephesos and the plain of the Maiander, if it be permitted\r\nto compare small things with great; and small these are in comparison,\r\nfor of the rivers which heaped up the soil in those regions none is\r\nworthy to be compared in volume with a single one of the mouths of the\r\nNile, which has five mouths. Moreover there are other rivers also, not\r\nin size at all equal to the Nile, which have performed great feats; of\r\nwhich I can mention the names of several, and especially the Acheloos,\r\nwhich flowing through Acarnania and so issuing out into the sea has\r\nalready made half of the Echinades from islands into mainland. Now there\r\nis in the land of Arabia, not far from Egypt, a gulf of the sea running\r\nin from that which is called the Erythraian Sea, very long and narrow,\r\nas I am about to tell. With respect to the length of the voyage along\r\nit, one who set out from the innermost point to sail out through it into\r\nthe open sea, would spend forty days upon the voyage, using oars; and\r\nwith respect to breadth, where the gulf is broadest it is half a day's\r\nsail across: and there is in it an ebb and flow of tide every day. Just\r\nsuch another gulf I suppose that Egypt was, and that the one ran in\r\ntowards Ethiopia from the Northern Sea, and the other, the Arabian,\r\nof which I am about to speak, tended from the South towards Syria,\r\nthe gulfs boring in so as almost to meet at their extreme points, and\r\npassing by one another with but a small space left between. If then the\r\nstream of the Nile should turn aside into this Arabian gulf, what would\r\nhinder that gulf from being filled up with silt as the river continued\r\nto flow, at all events within a period of twenty thousand years? indeed\r\nfor my part I am of the opinion that it would be filled up even within\r\nten thousand years. How, then, in all the time that has elapsed before I\r\ncame into being should not a gulf be filled up even of much greater size\r\nthan this by a river so great and so active? As regards Egypt then, I\r\nboth believe those who say that things are so, and for myself also I am\r\nstrongly of opinion that they are so; because I have observed that Egypt\r\nruns out into the sea further than the adjoining land, and that shells\r\nare found upon the mountains of it, and an efflorescence of salt forms\r\nupon the surface, so that even the pyramids are being eaten away by it,\r\nand moreover that of all the mountains of Egypt, the range which lies\r\nabove Memphis is the only one which has sand: besides which I notice\r\nthat Egypt resembles neither the land of Arabia, which borders upon it,\r\nnor Libya, nor yet Syria (for they are Syrians who dwell in the parts\r\nof Arabia lying along the sea), but that it has soil which is black and\r\neasily breaks up, seeing that it is in truth mud and silt brought down\r\nfrom Ethiopia by the river: but the soil of Libya, we know, is reddish\r\nin colour and rather sandy, while that of Arabia and Syria is somewhat\r\nclayey and rocky. The priests also gave me a strong proof concerning\r\nthis land as follows, namely that in the reign of king Moiris, whenever\r\nthe river reached a height of at least eight cubits it watered Egypt\r\nbelow Memphis; and not yet nine hundred years had gone by since the\r\ndeath of Moiris, when I heard these things from the priests: now\r\nhowever, unless the river rises to sixteen cubits, or fifteen at the\r\nleast, it does not go over the land. I think too that those Egyptians\r\nwho dwell below the lake of Moiris and especially in that region which\r\nis called the Delta, if that land continues to grow in height according\r\nto this proportion and to increase similarly in extent, will suffer for\r\nall remaining time, from the Nile not overflowing their land, that same\r\nthing which they themselves said that the Hellenes would at some time\r\nsuffer: for hearing that the whole land of the Hellenes has rain and is\r\nnot watered by rivers as theirs is, they said that the Hellenes would at\r\nsome time be disappointed of a great hope and would suffer the ills of\r\nfamine. This saying means that if the god shall not send them rain, but\r\nshall allow drought to prevail for a long time, the Hellenes will be\r\ndestroyed by hunger; for they have in fact no other supply of water\r\nto save them except from Zeus alone. This has been rightly said by\r\nthe Egyptians with reference to the Hellenes: but now let me tell\r\nhow matters are with the Egyptians themselves in their turn. If, in\r\naccordance with what I before said, their land below Memphis (for\r\nthis is that which is increasing) shall continue to increase in height\r\naccording to the same proportion as in the past time, assuredly those\r\nEgyptians who dwell here will suffer famine, if their land shall not\r\nhave rain nor the river be able to go over their fields. It is certain\r\nhowever that now they gather in fruit from the earth with less labour\r\nthan any other men and also with less than the other Egyptians; for they\r\nhave no labour in breaking up furrows with a plough nor in hoeing nor in\r\nany other of those labours which other men have about a crop; but when\r\nthe river has come up of itself and watered their fields and after\r\nwatering has left them again, then each man sows his own field and turns\r\ninto it swine, and when he has trodden the seed into the ground by\r\nmeans of the swine, after that he waits for the harvest, and when he has\r\nthreshed the corn by means of the swine, then he gathers it in.\r\n\r\nIf we desire to follow the opinions of the Ionians as regards Egypt, who\r\nsay that the Delta alone is Egypt, reckoning its sea-coast to be from\r\nthe watch-tower called of Perseus to the fish-curing houses of Pelusion,\r\na distance of forty _schoines_, and counting it to extend inland as far\r\nas the city of Kercasoros, where the Nile divides and runs to Pelusion\r\nand Canobos, while as for the rest of Egypt, they assign it partly to\r\nLibya and partly to Arabia,--if, I say, we should follow this account,\r\nwe should thereby declare that in former times the Egyptians had no land\r\nto live in; for, as we have seen, their Delta at any rate is alluvial,\r\nand has appeared (so to speak) lately, as the Egyptians themselves say\r\nand as my opinion is. If then at the first there was no land for them\r\nto live in, why did they waste their labour to prove that they had come\r\ninto being before all other men? They needed not to have made trial of\r\nthe children to see what language they would first utter. However I am\r\nnot of the opinion that the Egyptians came into being at the same time\r\nas that which is called by the Ionians the Delta, but that they existed\r\nalways ever since the human race came into being, and that as their land\r\nadvanced forwards, many of them were left in their first abodes and many\r\ncame down gradually to the lower parts. At least it is certain that in\r\nold times Thebes had the name of Egypt, and of this the circumference\r\nmeasures six thousand one hundred and twenty furlongs.\r\n\r\nIf then we judge aright of these matters, the opinion of the Ionians\r\nabout Egypt is not sound: but if the judgment of the Ionians is right, I\r\ndeclare that neither the Hellenes nor the Ionians themselves know how\r\nto reckon since they say that the whole earth is made up of three\r\ndivisions, Europe, Asia, and Libya: for they ought to count in addition\r\nto these the Delta of Egypt, since it belongs neither to Asia nor to\r\nLibya; for at least it cannot be the river Nile by this reckoning which\r\ndivides Asia from Libya, but the Nile is cleft at the point of this\r\nDelta so as to flow round it, and the result is that this land would\r\ncome between Asia and Libya.\r\n\r\nWe dismiss then our opinion of the Ionians, and express a judgment\r\nof our own on this matter also, that Egypt is all that land which is\r\ninhabited by Egyptians, just as Kilikia is that which is inhabited by\r\nKilikians and Assyria that which is inhabited by Assyrians, and we\r\nknow of no boundary properly speaking between Asia and Libya except\r\nthe borders of Egypt. If however we shall adopt the opinion which is\r\ncommonly held by the Hellenes, we shall suppose that the whole of Egypt,\r\nbeginning from the Cataract and the city of Elephantine, is divided into\r\ntwo parts and that it thus partakes of both the names, since one side\r\nwill thus belong to Libya and the other to Asia; for the Nile from the\r\nCataract onwards flows to the sea cutting Egypt through in the midst;\r\nand as far as the city of Kercasoros the Nile flows in one single\r\nstream, but from this city onwards it is parted into three ways; and\r\none, which is called the Pelusian mouth, turns towards the East; the\r\nsecond of the ways goes towards the West, and this is called the Canobic\r\nmouth; but that one of the ways which is straight runs thus,--when the\r\nriver in its course downwards comes to the point of the Delta, then it\r\ncuts the Delta through the midst and so issues out to the sea. In this\r\nwe have a portion of the water of the river which is not the smallest\r\nnor the least famous, and it is called the Sebennytic mouth. There are\r\nalso two other mouths which part off from the Sebennytic and go to\r\nthe sea, and these are called, one the Saitic, the other the Mendesian\r\nmouth. The Bolbitinitic, and Bucolic mouths, on the other hand, are\r\nnot natural but made by digging. Moreover also the answer given by the\r\nOracle of Ammon bears witness in support of my opinion that Egypt is of\r\nthe extent which I declare it to be in my account; and of this answer\r\nI heard after I had formed my own opinion about Egypt. For those of the\r\ncity of Marea and of Apis, dwelling in the parts of Egypt which border\r\non Libya, being of opinion themselves that they were Libyans and not\r\nEgyptians, and also being burdened by the rules of religious service,\r\nbecause they desired not to be debarred from the use of cows' flesh,\r\nsent to Ammon saying that they had nought in common with the Egyptians,\r\nfor they dwelt outside the Delta and agreed with them in nothing;\r\nand they said they desired that it might be lawful for them to eat\r\neverything without distinction. The god however did not permit them to\r\ndo so, but said that that land was Egypt where the Nile came over and\r\nwatered, and that those were Egyptians who dwelling below the city of\r\nElephantine drank of that river. Thus was it answered to them by the\r\nOracle about this: and the Nile, when it is in flood, goes over not only\r\nthe Delta but also of the land which is called Libyan and of that which\r\nis called Arabian sometimes as much as two days' journey on each side,\r\nand at times even more than this or at times less.\r\n\r\nAs regards the nature of the river, neither from the priests nor\r\nyet from any other man was I able to obtain any knowledge: and I was\r\ndesirous especially to learn from them about these matters, namely\r\nwhy the Nile comes down increasing in volume from the summer solstice\r\nonwards for a hundred days, and then, when it has reached the number of\r\nthese days, turns and goes back, failing in its stream, so that through\r\nthe whole winter season it continues to be low, and until the summer\r\nsolstice returns. Of none of these things was I able to receive any\r\naccount from the Egyptians, when I inquired of them what power the Nile\r\nhas whereby it is of a nature opposite to that of all other rivers. And\r\nI made inquiry, desiring to know both this which I say and also why,\r\nunlike all other rivers, it does not give rise to any breezes blowing\r\nfrom it. However some of the Hellenes who desired to gain distinction\r\nfor cleverness have given an account of this water in three different\r\nways: two of these I do not think it worth while even to speak of except\r\nonly to indicate their nature; of which the one says that the Etesian\r\nWinds are the cause that makes the river rise, by preventing the Nile\r\nfrom flowing out into the sea. But often the Etesian Winds fail and yet\r\nthe Nile does the same work as it is wont to do; and moreover, if these\r\nwere the cause, all the other rivers also which flow in a direction\r\nopposed to the Etesian Winds ought to have been affected in the same way\r\nas the Nile, and even more, in as much as they are smaller and present\r\nto them a feebler flow of streams: but there are many of these rivers in\r\nSyria and many also in Libya, and they are affected in no such manner as\r\nthe Nile. The second way shows more ignorance than that which has been\r\nmentioned, and it is more marvellous to tell; for it says that the river\r\nproduces these effects because it flows from the Ocean, and that the\r\nOcean flows round the whole earth. The third of the ways is much the\r\nmost specious, but nevertheless it is the most mistaken of all: for\r\nindeed this way has no more truth in it than the rest, alleging as it\r\ndoes that the Nile flows from melting snow; whereas it flows out of\r\nLibya through the midst of the Ethiopians, and so comes out into Egypt.\r\nHow then should it flow from snow, when it flows from the hottest parts\r\nto those which are cooler? And indeed most of the facts are such as\r\nto convince a man (one at least who is capable of reasoning about such\r\nmatters), that it is not at all likely that it flows from snow. The\r\nfirst and greatest evidence is afforded by the winds, which blow hot\r\nfrom these regions; the second is that the land is rainless always and\r\nwithout frost, whereas after snow has fallen rain must necessarily come\r\nwithin five days, so that if it snowed in those parts rain would fall\r\nthere; the third evidence is afforded by the people dwelling there, who\r\nare of a black colour by reason of the burning heat. Moreover kites and\r\nswallows remain there through the year and do not leave the land; and\r\ncranes flying from the cold weather which comes on in the region of\r\nScythia come regularly to these parts for wintering: if then it snowed\r\never so little in that land through which the Nile flows and in which\r\nit has its rise, none of these things would take place, as necessity\r\ncompels us to admit. As for him who talked about the Ocean, he carried\r\nhis tale into the region of the unknown, and so he need not be refuted;\r\nsince I for my part know of no river Ocean existing, but I think that\r\nHomer or one of the poets who were before him invented the name and\r\nintroduced it into his verse.\r\n\r\nIf however after I have found fault with the opinions proposed, I am\r\nbound to declare an opinion of my own about the matters which are in\r\ndoubt, I will tell what to my mind is the reason why the Nile increases\r\nin the summer. In the winter season the Sun, being driven away from his\r\nformer path through the heaven by the stormy winds, comes to the upper\r\nparts of Libya. If one would set forth the matter in the shortest way,\r\nall has now been said; for whatever region this god approaches most and\r\nstands directly above, this it may reasonably be supposed is most in\r\nwant of water, and its native streams of rivers are dried up most.\r\nHowever, to set it forth at greater length, thus it is:--the Sun passing\r\nin his course by the upper parts of Libya, does thus, that is to say,\r\nsince at all times the air in those parts is clear and the country is\r\nwarm, because there are no cold winds, in passing through it the Sun\r\ndoes just as he was wont to do in the summer, when going through the\r\nmidst of the heaven, that is he draws to himself the water, and having\r\ndrawn it he drives it away to the upper parts of the country, and the\r\nwinds take it up and scattering it abroad melt it into rain; so it is\r\nnatural that the winds which blow from this region, namely the South\r\nand South-west Winds, should be much the most rainy of all the winds. I\r\nthink however that the Sun does not send away from himself all the water\r\nof the Nile of each year, but that also he lets some remain behind with\r\nhimself. Then when the winter becomes milder, the Sun returns back again\r\nto the midst of the heaven, and from that time onwards he draws equally\r\nfrom all rivers; but in the meantime they flow in large volume, since\r\nwater of rain mingles with them in great quantity, because their country\r\nreceives rain then and is filled with torrent streams. In summer however\r\nthey are weak, since not only the showers of rain fail them, but also\r\nthey are drawn by the Sun. The Nile however, alone of all rivers, not\r\nhaving rain and being drawn by the Sun, naturally flows during this time\r\nof winter in much less than its proper volume, that is much less than in\r\nsummer; for then it is drawn equally with all the other waters, but in\r\nwinter it bears the burden alone. Thus I suppose the Sun to be the cause\r\nof these things. He also is the cause in my opinion that the air in\r\nthese parts is dry, since he makes it so by scorching up his path\r\nthrough the heaven: thus summer prevails always in the upper parts of\r\nLibya. If however the station of the seasons had been changed, and where\r\nnow in the heaven are placed the North Wind and winter, there was the\r\nstation of the South Wind and of the midday, and where now is placed\r\nthe South Wind, there was the North, if this had been so, the Sun being\r\ndriven from the midst of the heaven by the winter and the North Wind\r\nwould go to the upper parts of Europe, just as now he comes to the upper\r\nparts of Libya, and passing in his course throughout the whole of Europe\r\nI suppose he would do to the Ister that which he now works upon the\r\nNile. As to the breeze, why none blows from the river, my opinion is\r\nthat from very hot places it is not natural that anything should blow,\r\nand that a breeze is wont to blow from something cold.\r\n\r\nLet these matters then be as they are and as they were at the first: but\r\nas to the sources of the Nile, not one either of the Egyptians or of\r\nthe Libyans or of the Hellenes, who came to speech with me, professed to\r\nknow anything, except the scribe of the sacred treasury of Athene at the\r\ncity of Sais in Egypt. To me however this man seemed not to be speaking\r\nseriously when he said that he had certain knowledge of it; and he said\r\nas follows, namely that there were two mountains of which the tops ran\r\nup to a sharp point, situated between the city of Syene, which is in\r\nthe district of Thebes, and Elephantine, and the names of the mountains\r\nwere, of the one Crophi and of the other Mophi. From the middle between\r\nthese mountains flowed (he said) the sources of the Nile, which were\r\nfathomless in depth, and half of the water flowed to Egypt and towards\r\nthe North Wind, the other half to Ethiopia and the South Wind. As for\r\nthe fathomless depth of the source, he said that Psammetichos king of\r\nEgypt came to a trial of this matter; for he had a rope twisted of many\r\nthousand fathoms and let it down in this place, and it found no bottom.\r\nBy this the scribe (if this which he told was really as he said) gave me\r\nto understand that there were certain strong eddies there and a backward\r\nflow, and that since the water dashed against the mountains, therefore\r\nthe sounding-line could not come to any bottom when it was let down.\r\nFrom no other person was I able to learn anything about this matter;\r\nbut for the rest I learnt so much as here follows by the most diligent\r\ninquiry; for I went myself as an eye-witness as far as the city of\r\nElephantine and from that point onwards I gathered knowledge by report.\r\nFrom the city of Elephantine as one goes up the river there is country\r\nwhich slopes steeply; so that here one must attach ropes to the vessel\r\non both sides, as one fastens an ox, and so make one's way onward;\r\nand if the rope break, the vessel is gone at once, carried away by the\r\nviolence of the stream. Through this country it is a voyage of about\r\nfour days in length, and in this part the Nile is winding like the river\r\nMaiander, and the distance amounts to twelve _schoines_, which one must\r\ntraverse in this manner. Then you will come to a level plain, in which\r\nthe Nile flows round an island named Tachompso. (Now in the regions\r\nabove the Elephantine there dwell Ethiopians at once succeeding, who\r\nalso occupy half of the island, and Egyptians the other half.) Adjoining\r\nthis island there is a great lake, round which dwell Ethiopian nomad\r\ntribes; and when you have sailed through this you will come to the\r\nstream of the Nile again, which flows into this lake. After this you\r\nwill disembark and make a journey by land of forty days; for in the Nile\r\nsharp rocks stand forth out of the water, and there are many reefs, by\r\nwhich it is not possible for a vessel to pass. Then after having passed\r\nthrough this country in the forty days which I have said, you will\r\nembark again in another vessel and sail for twelve days; and after this\r\nyou will come to a great city called Meroe. This city is said to be\r\nthe mother-city of all the other Ethiopians: and they who dwell in it\r\nreverence of the gods Zeus and Dionysos alone, and these they greatly\r\nhonour; and they have an Oracle of Zeus established, and make warlike\r\nmarches whensoever the god commands them by prophesyings and to\r\nwhatsoever place he commands. Sailing from this city you will come to\r\nthe \"Deserters\" in another period of time equal to that in which you\r\ncame from Elephantine to the mother-city of the Ethiopians. Now the\r\nname of these \"Deserters\" is _Asmach_, and this word signifies, when\r\ntranslated into the tongue of the Hellenes, \"those who stand on the left\r\nhand of the king.\" These were two hundred and forty thousand Egyptians\r\nof the warrior class, who revolted and went over to these Ethiopians for\r\nthe following cause:--In the reign of Psammetichos garrisons were set,\r\none towards the Ethiopians at the city of Elephantine, another towards\r\nthe Arabians and Assyrians at Daphnai of Pelusion, and another towards\r\nLibya at Marea: and even in my own time the garrisons of the Persians\r\ntoo are ordered in the same manner as these were in the reign of\r\nPsammetichos, for both at Elephantine and at Daphnai the Persians have\r\noutposts. The Egyptians then of whom I speak had served as outposts for\r\nthree years and no one relieved them from their guard; accordingly they\r\ntook counsel together, and adopting a common plan they all in a body\r\nrevolted from Psammetichos and set out for Ethiopia. Hearing this\r\nPsammetichos set forth in pursuit, and when he came up with them he\r\nentreated them much and endeavoured to persuade them not to desert the\r\ngods of their country and their children and wives: upon which it is\r\nsaid that one of them pointed to his privy member and said that wherever\r\nthis was, there would they have both children and wives. When these came\r\nto Ethiopia they gave themselves over to the king of the Ethiopians; and\r\nhe rewarded them as follows:--there were certain of the Ethiopians who\r\nhad come to be at variance with him; and he bade them drive these out\r\nand dwell in their land. So since these men settled in the land of\r\nthe Ethiopians, the Ethiopians have come to be of milder manners, from\r\nhaving learnt the customs of the Egyptians.\r\n\r\nThe Nile then, besides the part of its course which is in Egypt, is\r\nknown as far as a four months' journey by river and land: for that is\r\nthe number of months which are found by reckoning to be spent in going\r\nfrom Elephantine to these \"Deserters\": and the river runs from the West\r\nand the setting of the sun. But what comes after that point no one can\r\nclearly say; for this land is desert by reason of the burning heat. This\r\nmuch however I heard from men of Kyrene, who told me that they had been\r\nto the Oracle of Ammon, and had come to speech with Etearchos king of\r\nthe Ammonians: and it happened that after speaking of other matters they\r\nfell to discourse about the Nile and how no one knew the sources of it;\r\nand Etearchos said that once there came to him men of the Nasamonians\r\n(this is a Libyan race which dwells in the Syrtis, and also in the land\r\nto the East of the Syrtis reaching to no great distance), and when the\r\nNasamonians came and were asked by him whether they were able to tell\r\nhim anything more than he knew about the desert parts of Libya, they\r\nsaid that there had been among them certain sons of chief men, who were\r\nof unruly disposition; and these when they grew up to be men had devised\r\nvarious other extravagant things and also they had told off by lot five\r\nof themselves to go to see the desert parts of Libya and to try\r\nwhether they could discover more than those who had previously explored\r\nfurthest: for in those parts of Libya which are by the Northern Sea,\r\nbeginning from Egypt and going as far as the headland of Soloeis, which\r\nis the extreme point of Libya, Libyans (and of them many races) extend\r\nalong the whole coast, except so much as the Hellenes and Phenicians\r\nhold; but in the upper parts, which lie above the sea-coast and above\r\nthose people whose land comes down to the sea, Libya is full of wild\r\nbeasts; and in the parts above the land of wild beasts it is full of\r\nsand, terribly waterless and utterly desert. These young men then (said\r\nthey), being sent out by their companions well furnished with supplies\r\nof water and provisions, went first through the inhabited country, and\r\nafter they had passed through this they came to the country of wild\r\nbeasts, and after this they passed through the desert, making their\r\njourney towards the West Wind; and having passed through a great tract\r\nof sand in many days, they saw at last trees growing in a level place;\r\nand having come up to them, they were beginning to pluck the fruit which\r\nwas upon the trees: but as they began to pluck it, there came upon them\r\nsmall men, of less stature than men of the common size, and these seized\r\nthem and carried them away; and neither could the Nasamonians understand\r\nanything of their speech nor could those who were carrying them off\r\nunderstand anything of the speech of the Nasamonians; and they led them\r\n(so it was said) through very great swamps, and after passing through\r\nthese they came to a city in which all the men were in size like those\r\nwho carried them off and in colour of skin black; and by the city ran\r\na great river, which ran from the West towards the sunrising, and in it\r\nwere seen crocodiles. Of the account given by Etearchos the Ammonian let\r\nso much suffice as is here said, except that, as the men of Kyrene told\r\nme, he alleged that the Nasamonians returned safe home, and that the\r\npeople to whom they had come were all wizards. Now this river which ran\r\nby the city, Etearchos conjectured to be the Nile, and moreover reason\r\ncompels us to think so; for the Nile flows from Libya and cuts Libya\r\nthrough in the midst, and as I conjecture, judging of what is not known\r\nby that which is evident to the view, it starts at a distance from its\r\nmouth equal to that of the Ister: for the river Ister begins from the\r\nKeltoi and the city of Pyrene and so runs that it divides Europe in the\r\nmidst (now the Keltoi are outside the Pillars of Heracles and border\r\nupon the Kynesians, who dwell furthest towards the sunset of all those\r\nwho have their dwelling in Europe): and the Ister ends, having its\r\ncourse through the whole of Europe, by flowing into the Euxine Sea at\r\nthe place where the Milesians have their settlement of Istria. Now the\r\nIster, since it flows through land which is inhabited, is known by\r\nthe reports of many; but of the sources of the Nile no one can give an\r\naccount, for the part of Libya through which it flows is uninhabited and\r\ndesert. About its course however so much as it was possible to learn by\r\nthe most diligent inquiry has been told; and it runs out into Egypt.\r\nNow Egypt lies nearly opposite to the mountain districts of Kilikia; and\r\nfrom thence to Sinope, which lies upon the Euxine Sea, is a journey in\r\nthe same straight line of five days for a man without encumbrance; and\r\nSinope lies opposite to the place where the Ister runs out into the sea:\r\nthus I think that the Nile passes through the whole of Libya and is of\r\nequal measure with the Ister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the Nile then let so much suffice as has been said. Of Egypt however\r\nI shall make my report at length, because it has wonders more in number\r\nthan any other land, and works too it has to show as much as any land,\r\nwhich are beyond expression great: for this reason then more shall be\r\nsaid concerning it.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians in agreement with their climate, which is unlike any\r\nother, and with the river, which shows a nature different from all other\r\nrivers, established for themselves manners and customs in a way opposite\r\nto other men in almost all matters: for among them the women frequent\r\nthe market and carry on trade, while the men remain at home and weave;\r\nand whereas others weave pushing the woof upwards, the Egyptians push\r\nit downwards: the men carry their burdens upon their heads and the\r\nwomen upon their shoulders: the women make water standing up and the\r\nmen crouching down: they ease themselves in their houses and they eat\r\nwithout in the streets, alleging as reason for this that it is right\r\nto do secretly the things that are unseemly though necessary, but those\r\nwhich are not unseemly, in public: no woman is a minister either of male\r\nor female divinity, but men of all, both male and female: to support\r\ntheir parents the sons are in no way compelled, if they do not desire\r\nto do so, but the daughters are forced to do so, be they never so\r\nunwilling. The priests of the gods in other lands wear long hair, but\r\nin Egypt they shave their heads: among other men the custom is that in\r\nmourning those whom the matter concerns most nearly have their hair cut\r\nshort, but the Egyptians, when deaths occur, let their hair grow long,\r\nboth that on the head and that on the chin, having before been close\r\nshaven: other men have their daily living separated from beasts, but the\r\nEgyptians have theirs together with beasts: other men live on wheat and\r\non barley, but to any one of the Egyptians who makes his living on these\r\nit is a great reproach; they make their bread of maize, which some call\r\nspelt: they knead dough with their feet and clay with their hands, with\r\nwhich also they gather up dung: and whereas other men, except such as\r\nhave learnt otherwise from the Egyptians, have their members as nature\r\nmade them, the Egyptians practice circumcision: as to garments, the men\r\nwear two each and the women but one: and whereas others make fast the\r\nrings and ropes of the sails outside the ship, the Egyptians do this\r\ninside: finally in the writing of characters and reckoning with pebbles,\r\nwhile the Hellenes carry the hand from the left to the right, the\r\nEgyptians do this from the right to the left; and doing so they say that\r\nthey do it themselves rightwise and the Hellenes leftwise: and they use\r\ntwo kinds of characters for writing, of which the one kind is called\r\nsacred and the other common.\r\n\r\nThey are religious excessively beyond all other men, and with regard to\r\nthis they have customs as follows:--they drink from cups of bronze and\r\nrinse them out every day, and not some only do this but all: they wear\r\ngarments of linen always newly washed, and this they make a special\r\npoint of practice: they circumcise themselves for the sake of\r\ncleanliness, preferring to be clean rather than comely. The priests\r\nshave themselves all over their body every other day, so that no lice or\r\nany other foul thing may come to be upon them when they minister to\r\nthe gods; and the priests wear garments of linen only and sandals of\r\npapyrus, and any other garment they may not take nor other sandals;\r\nthese wash themselves in cold water twice in a day and twice again in\r\nthe night; and other religious services they perform (one may almost\r\nsay) of infinite number. They enjoy also good things not a few, for they\r\ndo not consume or spend anything of their own substance, but there is\r\nsacred bread baked for them and they have each great quantity of flesh\r\nof oxen and geese coming in to them each day, and also wine of grapes is\r\ngiven to them; but it is not permitted to them to taste of fish: beans\r\nmoreover the Egyptians do not at all sow in their land, and those which\r\nthey grow they neither eat raw nor boil for food; nay the priests do not\r\nendure even to look upon them, thinking this to be an unclean kind of\r\npulse: and there is not one priest only for each of the gods but many,\r\nand of them one is chief-priest, and whenever a priest dies his son is\r\nappointed to his place.\r\n\r\nThe males of the ox kind they consider to belong to Epaphos, and on\r\naccount of him they test them in the following manner:--If the priest\r\nsees one single black hair upon the beast he counts it not clean for\r\nsacrifice; and one of the priests who is appointed for the purpose makes\r\ninvestigation of these matters, both when the beast is standing upright\r\nand when it is lying on its back, drawing out its tongue moreover, to\r\nsee if it is clean in respect of the appointed signs, which I shall tell\r\nof in another part of the history: he looks also at the hairs of the\r\ntail to see if it has them growing in a natural manner; and if it\r\nbe clean in respect of all these things, he marks it with a piece of\r\npapyrus, rolling this round the horns, and then when he has plastered\r\nsealing-earth over it he sets upon it the seal of his signet-ring, and\r\nafter that they take the animal away. But for one who sacrifices a beast\r\nnot sealed the penalty appointed is death. In this way then the beast\r\nis tested; and their appointed manner of sacrifice is as follows:--they\r\nlead the sealed beast to the altar where they happen to be sacrificing,\r\nand then kindle a fire: after that, having poured libations of wine over\r\nthe altar so that it runs down upon the victim and having called upon\r\nthe god, they cut its throat, and having cut its throat they sever the\r\nhead from the body. The body then of the beast they flay, but upon the\r\nhead they make many imprecations first, and then they who have a market\r\nand Hellenes sojourning among them for trade, these carry it to the\r\nmarket-place and sell it, while they who have no Hellenes among them\r\ncast it away into the river: and this is the form of imprecations which\r\nthey utter upon the heads, praying that if any evil be about to befall\r\neither themselves who are offering sacrifice or the land of Egypt in\r\ngeneral, it may come rather upon this head. Now as regards the heads of\r\nthe beasts which are sacrificed and the pouring over them of the\r\nwine, all the Egyptians have the same customs equally for all their\r\nsacrifices; and by reason of this custom none of the Egyptians eat of\r\nthe head either of this or of any other kind of animal: but the manner\r\nof disembowelling the victims and of burning them is appointed among\r\nthem differently for different sacrifices; I shall speak however of the\r\nsacrifices to that goddess whom they regard as the greatest of all, and\r\nto whom they celebrate the greatest feast.--When they have flayed the\r\nbullock and made imprecation, they take out the whole of its lower\r\nentrails but leave in the body the upper entrails and the fat; and they\r\nsever from it the legs and the end of the loin and the shoulders and the\r\nneck: and this done, they fill the rest of the body of the animal with\r\nconsecrated loaves and honey and raisins and figs and frankincense and\r\nmyrrh and every other kind of spices, and having filled it with these\r\nthey offer it, pouring over it great abundance of oil. They make their\r\nsacrifice after fasting, and while the offerings are being burnt, they\r\nall beat themselves for mourning, and when they have finished beating\r\nthemselves they set forth as a feast that which they left unburnt of the\r\nsacrifice. The clean males then of the ox kind, both full-grown animals\r\nand calves, are sacrificed by all the Egyptians; the females however\r\nthey may not sacrifice, but these are sacred to Isis; for the figure of\r\nIsis is in the form of a woman with cow's horns, just as the Hellenes\r\npresent Io in pictures, and all the Egyptians without distinction\r\nreverence cows far more than any other kind of cattle; for which reason\r\nneither man nor woman of the Egyptian race would kiss a man who is a\r\nHellene on the mouth, nor will they use a knife or roasting-spits or\r\na caldron belonging to a Hellene, nor taste the flesh even of a clean\r\nanimal if it has been cut with the knife of a Hellene. And the cattle of\r\nthis kind which die they bury in the following manner:--the females they\r\ncast into the river, but the males they bury, each people in the suburb\r\nof their town, with one of the horns, or sometimes both, protruding to\r\nmark the place; and when the bodies have rotted away and the appointed\r\ntime comes on, then to each city comes a boat from that which is called\r\nthe island of Prosopitis (this is in the Delta, and the extent of its\r\ncircuit is nine _schoines_). In this island of Prosopitis is situated,\r\nbesides many other cities, that one from which the boats come to take up\r\nthe bones of the oxen, and the name of the city is Atarbechis, and in\r\nit there is set up a holy temple of Aphrodite. From this city many go\r\nabroad in various directions, some to one city and others to another,\r\nand when they have dug up the bones of the oxen they carry them off, and\r\ncoming together they bury them in one single place. In the same manner\r\nas they bury the oxen they bury also their other cattle when they die;\r\nfor about them also they have the same law laid down, and these also\r\nthey abstain from killing.\r\n\r\nNow all who have a temple set up to the Theban Zeus or who are of the\r\ndistrict of Thebes, these, I say, all sacrifice goats and abstain from\r\nsheep: for not all the Egyptians equally reverence the same gods,\r\nexcept only Isis and Osiris (who they say is Dionysos), these they all\r\nreverence alike: but they who have a temple of Mendes or belong to the\r\nMendesian district, these abstain from goats and sacrifice sheep. Now\r\nthe men of Thebes and those who after their example abstain from sheep,\r\nsay that this custom was established among them for the cause which\r\nfollows:--Heracles (they say) had an earnest desire to see Zeus, and\r\nZeus did not desire to be seen of him; and at last when Heracles was\r\nurgent in entreaty Zeus contrived this device, that is to say, he flayed\r\na ram and held in front of him the head of the ram which he had cut off,\r\nand he put on over him the fleece and then showed himself to him. Hence\r\nthe Egyptians make the image of Zeus with the face of a ram; and the\r\nAmmonians do so also after their example, being settlers both from\r\nthe Egyptians and from the Ethiopians, and using a language which is a\r\nmedley of both tongues: and in my opinion it is from this god that the\r\nEgyptians call Zeus _Amun_. The Thebans then do not sacrifice rams but\r\nhold them sacred for this reason; on one day however in the year, on the\r\nfeast of Zeus, they cut up in the same manner and flay one single ram\r\nand cover with its skin the image of Zeus, and then they bring up to\r\nit another image of Heracles. This done, all who are in the temple beat\r\nthemselves in lamentation for the ram, and then they bury it in a sacred\r\ntomb.\r\n\r\nAbout Heracles I heard the account given that he was of the number of\r\nthe twelve gods; but of the other Heracles whom the Hellenes know I was\r\nnot able to hear in any part of Egypt: and moreover to prove that the\r\nEgyptians did not take the name of Heracles from the Hellenes, but\r\nrather the Hellenes from the Egyptians,--that is to say those of the\r\nHellenes who gave the name Heracles to the son of Amphitryon,--of that,\r\nI say, besides many other evidences there is chiefly this, namely that\r\nthe parents of this Heracles, Amphitryon and Alcmene, were both of Egypt\r\nby descent, and also that the Egyptians say that they do not know\r\nthe names either of Poseidon or of the Dioscuroi, nor have these been\r\naccepted by them as gods among the other gods; whereas if they had\r\nreceived from the Hellenes the name of any divinity, they would\r\nnaturally have preserved the memory of these most of all, assuming that\r\nin those times as now some of the Hellenes were wont to make voyages\r\nand were seafaring folk, as I suppose and as my judgment compels me to\r\nthink; so that the Egyptians would have learnt the names of these gods\r\neven more than that of Heracles. In fact however Heracles is a very\r\nancient Egyptian god; and (as they say themselves) it is seventeen\r\nthousand years to the beginning of the reign of Amasis from the time\r\nwhen the twelve gods, of whom they count that Heracles is one, were\r\nbegotten of the eight gods. I moreover, desiring to know something\r\ncertain of these matters so far as might be, made a voyage also to\r\nTyre of Phenicia, hearing that in that place there was a holy temple\r\nof Heracles; and I saw that it was richly furnished with many votive\r\nofferings besides, and especially there were in it two pillars, the one\r\nof pure gold and the other of an emerald stone of such size as to shine\r\nby night: and having come to speech with the priests of the god, I asked\r\nthem how long a time it was since their temple had been set up: and\r\nthese also I found to be at variance with the Hellenes, for they said\r\nthat at the same time when Tyre was founded, the temple of the god also\r\nhad been set up, and that it was a period of two thousand three hundred\r\nyears since their people began to dwell at Tyre. I saw also at Tyre\r\nanother temple of Heracles, with the surname Thasian; and I came\r\nto Thasos also and there I found a temple of Heracles set up by the\r\nPhenicians, who had sailed out to seek for Europa and had colonised\r\nThasos; and these things happened full five generations of men before\r\nHeracles the son of Amphitryon was born in Hellas. So then my inquiries\r\nshow clearly that Heracles is an ancient god, and those of the Hellenes\r\nseem to me to act most rightly who have two temples of Heracles set\r\nup, and who sacrifice to the one as an immortal god and with the\r\ntitle Olympian, and make offerings of the dead to the other as a hero.\r\nMoreover, besides many other stories which the Hellenes tell without\r\ndue consideration, this tale is especially foolish which they tell about\r\nHeracles, namely that when he came to Egypt, the Egyptians put on him\r\nwreaths and led him forth in procession to sacrifice him to Zeus; and he\r\nfor some time kept quiet, but when they were beginning the sacrifice of\r\nhim at the altar, he betook himself to prowess and slew them all. I for\r\nmy part am of opinion that the Hellenes when they tell this tale are\r\naltogether without knowledge of the nature and customs of the Egyptians;\r\nfor how should they for whom it is not lawful to sacrifice even beasts,\r\nexcept swine and the males of oxen and calves (such of them as are\r\nclean) and geese, how should these sacrifice human beings? Besides this,\r\nhow is it in nature possible that Heracles, being one person only and\r\nmoreover a man (as they assert), should slay many myriads? Having said\r\nso much of these matters, we pray that we may have grace from both the\r\ngods and the heroes for our speech.\r\n\r\nNow the reason why those of the Egyptians whom I have mentioned do not\r\nsacrifice goats, female or male, is this:--the Mendesians count Pan to\r\nbe one of the eight gods (now these eight gods they say came into being\r\nbefore the twelve gods), and the painters and image-makers represent in\r\npainting and in sculpture the figure of Pan, just as the Hellenes do,\r\nwith goat's face and legs, not supposing him to be really like this but\r\nto resemble the other gods; the cause however why they represent him in\r\nthis form I prefer not to say. The Mendesians then reverence all goats\r\nand the males more than the females (and the goatherds too have\r\ngreater honour than other herdsmen), but of the goats one especially\r\nis reverenced, and when he dies there is great mourning in all the\r\nMendesian district: and both the goat and Pan are called in the Egyptian\r\ntongue _Mendes_. Moreover in my lifetime there happened in that district\r\nthis marvel, that is to say a he-goat had intercourse with a woman\r\npublicly, and this was so done that all men might have evidence of it.\r\n\r\nThe pig is accounted by the Egyptians an abominable animal; and first,\r\nif any of them in passing by touch a pig, he goes into the river and\r\ndips himself forthwith in the water together with his garments; and then\r\ntoo swineherds, though they may be native Egyptians, unlike all others,\r\ndo not enter any of the temples in Egypt, nor is anyone willing to give\r\nhis daughter in marriage to one of them or to take a wife from among\r\nthem; but the swineherds both give in marriage to one another and take\r\nfrom one another. Now to the other gods the Egyptians do not think it\r\nright to sacrifice swine; but to the Moon and to Dionysos alone at the\r\nsame time and on the same full-moon they sacrifice swine, and then eat\r\ntheir flesh: and as to the reason why, when they abominate swine at all\r\ntheir other feasts, they sacrifice them at this, there is a story told\r\nby the Egyptians; and this story I know, but it is not a seemly one for\r\nme to tell. Now the sacrifice of the swine to the Moon is performed as\r\nfollows:--when the priest has slain the victim, he puts together the\r\nend of the tail and the spleen and the caul, and covers them up with the\r\nwhole of the fat of the animal which is about the paunch, and then he\r\noffers them with fire; and the rest of the flesh they eat on that day of\r\nfull moon upon which they have held sacrifice, but on any day after this\r\nthey will not taste of it: the poor however among them by reason of the\r\nscantiness of their means shape pigs of dough and having baked them they\r\noffer these as a sacrifice. Then for Dionysos on the eve of the festival\r\neach one kills a pig by cutting its throat before his own doors, and\r\nafter that he gives the pig to the swineherd who sold it to him, to\r\ncarry away again; and the rest of the feast of Dionysos is celebrated\r\nby the Egyptians in the same way as by the Hellenes in almost all things\r\nexcept choral dances, but instead of the _phallos_ they have invented\r\nanother contrivance, namely figures of about a cubit in height worked\r\nby strings, which women carry about the villages, with the privy member\r\nmade to move and not much less in size than the rest of the body: and a\r\nflute goes before and they follow singing the praises of Dionysos. As\r\nto the reason why the figure has this member larger than is natural and\r\nmoves it, though it moves no other part of the body, about this there is\r\na sacred story told. Now I think that Melampus the son of Amytheon was\r\nnot without knowledge of these rites of sacrifice, but was acquainted\r\nwith them: for Melampus is he who first set forth to the Hellenes the\r\nname of Dionysos and the manner of sacrifice and the procession of the\r\n_phallos_. Strictly speaking indeed, he when he made it known did not\r\ntake in the whole, but those wise men who came after him made it known\r\nmore at large. Melampus then is he who taught of the _phallos_ which is\r\ncarried in procession for Dionysos, and from him the Hellenes learnt to\r\ndo that which they do. I say then that Melampus being a man of ability\r\ncontrived for himself an art of divination, and having learnt from Egypt\r\nhe taught the Hellenes many things, and among them those that concern\r\nDionysos, making changes in some few points of them: for I shall not say\r\nthat that which is done in worship of the god in Egypt came accidentally\r\nto be the same with that which is done among the Hellenes, for then\r\nthese rites would have been in character with the Hellenic worship and\r\nnot lately brought in; nor certainly shall I say that the Egyptians took\r\nfrom the Hellenes either this or any other customary observance: matters\r\nconcerning Dionysos from Cadmos the Tyrian and from those who came with\r\nhim from Phenicia to the land which we now call Boeotia.\r\n\r\nMoreover the naming of almost all the gods has come to Hellas from\r\nEgypt: for that it has come from the Barbarians I find by inquiry is\r\ntrue, and I am of opinion that most probably it has come from Egypt,\r\nbecause, except in the case of Poseidon and the Dioscuroi (in accordance\r\nwith that which I have said before), and also of Hera and Hestia and\r\nThemis and the Charites and Nereids, the Egyptians say themselves: but\r\nas for the gods whose names they profess that they do not know, these I\r\nthink received their naming from the Pelasgians, except Poiseidon;\r\nbut about this god the Hellenes learnt from the Libyans, for no people\r\nexcept the Libyans have had the name of Poseidon from the first and have\r\npaid honour to this god always. Nor, it may be added, have the Egyptians\r\nany custom of worshipping heroes. These observances then, and others\r\nbesides these which I shall mention, the Hellenes have adopted from\r\nthe Egyptians; but to make, as they do the images of Hermes with\r\nthe _phallos_ they have learnt not from the Egyptians but from the\r\nPelasgians, the custom having been received by the Athenians first of\r\nall the Hellenes and from these by the rest; for just at the time when\r\nthe Athenians were beginning to rank among the Hellenes, the Pelasgians\r\nbecame dwellers with them in their land, and from this very cause it was\r\nthat they began to be counted as Hellenes. Whosoever has been initiated\r\nin the mysteries of the Cabeiroi, which the Samothrakians perform having\r\nreceived them from the Pelasgians, that man knows the meaning of my\r\nspeech; for these very Pelasgians who became dwellers with the Athenians\r\nused to dwell before that time in Samothrake, and from them the\r\nSamothrakians received their mysteries. So then the Athenians were the\r\nfirst of the Hellenes who made the images of Hermes with the _phallos_,\r\nhaving learnt from the Pelasgians; and the Pelasgians told a sacred\r\nstory about it, which is set forth in the mysteries in Samothrake. Now\r\nthe Pelasgians formerly were wont to make all their sacrifices calling\r\nupon the gods in prayer, as I know from that which I heard at Dodona,\r\nbut they gave no title or name to any of them, for they had not yet\r\nheard any, but they called them gods from some such notion as this,\r\nthat they had set in order all things and so had the distribution of\r\neverything. Afterwards when much time had elapsed, they learnt from\r\nEgypt the names of the gods, all except Dionysos, for his name they\r\nlearnt long afterwards; and after a time the Pelasgians consulted the\r\nOracle at Dodona about the names, for this prophetic seat is accounted\r\nto be the most ancient of the Oracles which are among the Hellenes,\r\nand at that time it was the only one. So when the Pelasgians asked the\r\nOracle at Dodona whether they should adopt the names which had come from\r\nthe Barbarians, the Oracle in reply bade them make use of the names.\r\nFrom this time they sacrificed using the names of the gods, and from the\r\nPelasgians the Hellenes afterwards received them: but when the several\r\ngods had their birth, or whether they all were from the beginning, and\r\nof what form they are, they did not learn till yesterday, as it were, or\r\nthe day before: for Hesiod and Homer I suppose were four hundred years\r\nbefore my time and not more, and these are they who made a theogony for\r\nthe Hellenes and gave the titles to the gods and distributed to them\r\nhonours and arts, and set forth their forms: but the poets who are said\r\nto have been before these men were really in my opinion after them. Of\r\nthese things the first are said by the priestesses of Dodona, and the\r\nlatter things, those namely which have regard to Hesiod and Homer, by\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Oracles both that among the Hellenes and that in Libya,\r\nthe Egyptians tell the following tale. The priests of the Theban Zeus\r\ntold me that two women in the service of the temple had been carried\r\naway from Thebes by Phenicians, and that they had heard that one of them\r\nhad been sold to go into Libya and the other to the Hellenes; and these\r\nwomen, they said, were they who first founded the prophetic seats among\r\nthe nations which have been named: and when I inquired whence they knew\r\nso perfectly of this tale which they told, they said in reply that a\r\ngreat search had been made by the priests after these women, and that\r\nthey had not been able to find them, but they had heard afterwards this\r\ntale about them which they were telling. This I heard from the priests\r\nat Thebes, and what follows is said by the prophetesses of Dodona. They\r\nsay that two black doves flew from Thebes in Egypt, and came one of them\r\nto Libya and the other to their land. And this latter settled upon an\r\noak-tree and spoke with human voice, saying that it was necessary that\r\na prophetic seat of Zeus should be established in that place; and they\r\nsupposed that that was of the gods which was announced to them, and made\r\none accordingly: and the dove which went away to the Libyans, they say,\r\nbade the Libyans make an Oracle of Ammon; and this also is of Zeus. The\r\npriestesses of Dodona told me these things, of whom the eldest was named\r\nPromeneia, the next after her Timarete, and the youngest Nicandra;\r\nand the other people of Dodona who were engaged about the temple gave\r\naccounts agreeing with theirs. I however have an opinion about the\r\nmatter as follows:--If the Phenicians did in truth carry away the\r\nconsecrated women and sold one of them into Libya and the other into\r\nHellas, I suppose that in the country now called Hellas, which was\r\nformerly called Pelasgia, this woman was sold into the land of the\r\nThesprotians; and then being a slave there she set up a sanctuary of\r\nZeus under a real oak-tree; as indeed it was natural that being an\r\nattendant of the sanctuary of Zeus at Thebes, she should there, in the\r\nplace to which she had come, have a memory of him; and after this, when\r\nshe got understanding of the Hellenic tongue, she established an Oracle,\r\nand she reported, I suppose, that her sister had been sold in Libya by\r\nthe same Phenicians by whom she herself had been sold. Moreover, I think\r\nthat the women were called doves by the people of Dodona for the reason\r\nthat they were barbarians and because it seemed to them that they\r\nuttered voice like birds; but after a time (they say) the dove spoke\r\nwith human voice, that is when the woman began to speak so that they\r\ncould understand; but so long as she spoke a Barbarian tongue she seemed\r\nto them to be uttering voice like a bird: for if it had been really a\r\ndove, how could it speak with human voice? And in saying that the\r\ndove was black, they indicate that the woman was Egyptian. The ways of\r\ndelivering oracles too at Thebes in Egypt and at Dodona closely resemble\r\neach other, as it happens, and also the method of divination by victims\r\nhas come from Egypt.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is true also that the Egyptians were the first of men who\r\nmade solemn assemblies and processions and approaches to the temples,\r\nand from them the Hellenes have learnt them, and my evidence for this\r\nis that the Egyptian celebrations of these have been held from a very\r\nancient time, whereas the Hellenic were introduced but lately. The\r\nEgyptians hold their solemn assemblies not once in the year but often,\r\nespecially and with the greatest zeal and devotion at the city of\r\nBubastis for Artemis, and next at Busiris for Isis; for in this\r\nlast-named city there is a very great temple of Isis, and this city\r\nstands in the middle of the Delta of Egypt; now Isis is in the tongue of\r\nthe Hellenes Demeter: thirdly, they have a solemn assembly at the city\r\nof Sais for Athene, fourthly at Heliopolis for the Sun (Helios), fifthly\r\nat the city of Buto in honour of Leto, and sixthly at the city of\r\nPapremis for Ares. Now, when they are coming to the city of Bubastis\r\nthey do as follows:--they sail men and women together, and a great\r\nmultitude of each sex in every boat; and some of the women have rattles\r\nand rattle with them, while some of the men play the flute during the\r\nwhole time of the voyage, and the rest, both women and men, sing and\r\nclap their hands; and when as they sail they come opposite to any city\r\non the way they bring the boat to land, and some of the women continue\r\nto do as I have said, others cry aloud and jeer at the women in that\r\ncity, some dance, and some stand up and pull up their garments. This\r\nthey do by every city along the river-bank; and when they come to\r\nBubastis they hold festival celebrating great sacrifices, and more wine\r\nof grapes is consumed upon that festival than during the whole of the\r\nrest of the year. To this place (so say the natives) they come together\r\nyear by year even to the number of seventy myriads of men and women,\r\nbesides children. Thus it is done here; and how they celebrate the\r\nfestival in honour of Isis at the city of Busiris has been told by\r\nme before: for, as I said, they beat themselves in mourning after the\r\nsacrifice, all of them both men and women, very many myriads of people;\r\nbut for whom they beat themselves it is not permitted to me by religion\r\nto say: and so many as there are of the Carians dwelling in Egypt do\r\nthis even more than the Egyptians themselves, inasmuch as they cut their\r\nforeheads also with knives; and by this it is manifested that they are\r\nstrangers and not Egyptians. At the times when they gather together\r\nat the city of Sais for their sacrifices, on a certain night they all\r\nkindle lamps many in number in the open air round about the houses; now\r\nthe lamps are saucers full of salt and oil mixed, and the wick floats by\r\nitself on the surface, and this burns during the whole night; and to\r\nthe festival is given the name _Lychnocaia_ (the lighting of lamps).\r\nMoreover those of the Egyptians who have not come to this solemn\r\nassembly observe the night of the festival and themselves also light\r\nlamps all of them, and thus not in Sais alone are they lighted, but over\r\nall Egypt: and as to the reason why light and honour are allotted to\r\nthis night, about this there is a sacred story told. To Heliopolis and\r\nButo they go year by year and do sacrifice only: but at Papremis they\r\ndo sacrifice and worship as elsewhere, and besides that, when the sun\r\nbegins to go down while some few of the priests are occupied with the\r\nimage of the god, the greater number of them stand in the entrance of\r\nthe temple with wooden clubs, and other persons to the number of more\r\nthan a thousand men with purpose to perform a vow, these also having\r\nall of them staves of wood, stand in a body opposite to those: and the\r\nimage, which is in a small shrine of wood covered over with gold, they\r\ntake out on the day before to another sacred building. The few then\r\nwho have been left about the image, draw a wain with four wheels, which\r\nbears the shrine and the image that is within the shrine, and the other\r\npriests standing in the gateway try to prevent it from entering, and\r\nthe men who are under a vow come to the assistance of the god and strike\r\nthem, while the others defend themselves. Then there comes to be a\r\nhard fight with staves, and they break one another's heads, and I am\r\nof opinion that many even die of the wounds they receive; the Egyptians\r\nhowever told me that no one died. This solemn assembly the people of the\r\nplace say that they established for the following reason:--the mother\r\nof Ares, they say, used to dwell in this temple, and Ares, having been\r\nbrought up away from her, when he grew up came thither desiring to visit\r\nhis mother, and the attendants of his mother's temple, not having seen\r\nhim before, did not permit him to pass in, but kept him away; and\r\nhe brought men to help him from another city and handled roughly the\r\nattendants of the temple, and entered to visit his mother. Hence, they\r\nsay, this exchange of blows has become the custom in honour of Ares upon\r\nhis festival.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians were the first who made it a point of religion not to lie\r\nwith women in temples, nor to enter into temples after going away\r\nfrom women without first bathing: for almost all other men except the\r\nEgyptians and the Hellenes lie with women in temples and enter into a\r\ntemple after going away from women without bathing, since they hold that\r\nthere is no difference in this respect between men and beasts: for\r\nthey say that they see beasts and the various kinds of birds coupling\r\ntogether both in the temples and in the sacred enclosures of the gods;\r\nif then this were not pleasing to the god, the beasts would not do so.\r\n\r\nThus do these defend that which they do, which by me is disallowed:\r\nbut the Egyptians are excessively careful in their observances, both\r\nin other matters which concern the sacred rites and also in those which\r\nfollow:--Egypt, though it borders upon Libya, does not very much abound\r\nin wild animals, but such as they have are one and all accounted by them\r\nsacred, some of them living with men and others not. But if I should say\r\nfor what reasons the sacred animals have been thus dedicated, I should\r\nfall into discourse of matters pertaining to the gods, of which I most\r\ndesire not to speak; and what I have actually said touching slightly\r\nupon them, I said because I was constrained by necessity. About these\r\nanimals there is a custom of this kind:--persons have been appointed of\r\nthe Egyptians, both men and women, to provide the food for each kind\r\nof beast separately, and their office goes down from father to son; and\r\nthose who dwell in the various cities perform vows to them thus, that\r\nis, when they make a vow to the god to whom the animal belongs, they\r\nshave the head of their children either the whole or the half or the\r\nthird part of it, and then set the hair in the balance against silver,\r\nand whatever it weighs, this the man gives to the person who provides\r\nfor the animals, and she cuts up fish of equal value and gives it for\r\nfood to the animals. Thus food for their support has been appointed and\r\nif any one kill any of these animals, the penalty, if he do it with his\r\nown will, is death, and if against his will, such penalty as the priests\r\nmay appoint: but whosoever shall kill an ibis or a hawk, whether it be\r\nwith his will or against his will, must die. Of the animals that live\r\nwith men there are great numbers, and would be many more but for the\r\naccidents which befall the cats. For when the females have produced\r\nyoung they are no longer in the habit of going to the males, and these\r\nseeking to be united with them are not able. To this end then they\r\ncontrive as follows,--they either take away by force or remove secretly\r\nthe young from the females and kill them (but after killing they do not\r\neat them), and the females being deprived of their young and desiring\r\nmore, therefore come to the males, for it is a creature that is fond\r\nof its young. Moreover when a fire occurs, the cats seem to be divinely\r\npossessed; for while the Egyptians stand at intervals and look after\r\nthe cats, not taking any care to extinguish the fire, the cats slipping\r\nthrough or leaping over the men, jump into the fire; and when this\r\nhappens, great mourning comes upon the Egyptians. And in whatever houses\r\na cat has died by a natural death, all those who dwell in this house\r\nshave their eyebrows only, but those in which a dog has died shave their\r\nwhole body and also their head. The cats when they are dead are carried\r\naway to sacred buildings in the city of Bubastis, where after being\r\nembalmed they are buried; but the dogs they bury each people in their\r\nown city in sacred tombs; and the ichneumons are buried just in the same\r\nway as the dogs. The shrewmice however and the hawks they carry away to\r\nthe city of Buto, and the ibises to Hermopolis; the bears (which are not\r\ncommonly seen) and the wolves, not much larger in size than foxes, they\r\nbury on the spot where they are found lying.\r\n\r\nOf the crocodile the nature is as follows:--during the four most wintry\r\nmonths this creature eats nothing: she has four feet and is an animal\r\nbelonging to the land and the water both; for she produces and hatches\r\neggs on the land, and the most part of the day she remains upon dry\r\nland, but the whole of the night in the river, for the water in truth\r\nis warmer than the unclouded open air and the dew. Of all the mortal\r\ncreatures of which we have knowledge this grows to the greatest bulk\r\nfrom the smallest beginning; for the eggs which she produces are not\r\nmuch larger than those of geese and the newly-hatched young one is in\r\nproportion to the egg, but as he grows he becomes as much as seventeen\r\ncubits long and sometimes yet larger. He has eyes like those of a pig\r\nand teeth large and tusky, in proportion to the size of his body; but\r\nunlike all other beasts he grows no tongue, neither does he move his\r\nlower jaw, but brings the upper jaw towards the lower, being in this too\r\nunlike all other beasts. He has moreover strong claws and a scaly hide\r\nupon his back which cannot be pierced; and he is blind in the water, but\r\nin the air he is of a very keen sight. Since he has his living in the\r\nwater he keeps his mouth all full within of leeches; and whereas all\r\nother birds and beasts fly from him, the trochilus is a creature which\r\nis at peace with him, seeing that from her he receives benefit; for\r\nthe crocodile having come out of the water to the land and then having\r\nopened his mouth (this he is wont to do generally towards the West\r\nWind), the trochilus upon that enters into his mouth and swallows down\r\nthe leeches, and he being benefited is pleased and does no harm to\r\nthe trochilus. Now for some of the Egyptians the crocodiles are sacred\r\nanimals, and for others not so, but they treat them on the contrary\r\nas enemies: those however who dwell about Thebes and about the lake of\r\nMoiris hold them to be most sacred, and each of these two peoples keeps\r\none crocodile selected from the whole number, which has been trained\r\nto tameness, and they put hanging ornaments of molten stone and of gold\r\ninto the ears of these and anklets round the front feet, and they give\r\nthem food appointed and victims of sacrifices and treat them as well\r\nas possible while they live, and after they are dead they bury them\r\nin sacred tombs, embalming them: but those who dwell about the city\r\nof Elephantine even eat them, not holding them to be sacred. They are\r\ncalled not crocodiles but _champsai_, and the Ionians gave them the name\r\nof crocodile, comparing their form to that of the crocodiles (lizards)\r\nwhich appear in their country in the stone walls. There are many ways in\r\nuse of catching them and of various kinds: I shall describe that which\r\nto me seems the most worthy of being told. A man puts the back of a pig\r\nupon a hook as bait, and lets it go into the middle of the river, while\r\nhe himself upon the bank of the river has a young live pig, which he\r\nbeats; and the crocodile hearing its cries makes for the direction of\r\nthe sound, and when he finds the pig's back he swallows it down: then\r\nthey pull, and when he is drawn out to land, first of all the hunter\r\nforthwith plasters up his eyes with mud, and having done so he very\r\neasily gets the mastery of him, but if he does not do so he has much\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nThe river-horse is sacred in the district of Papremis, but for the\r\nother Egyptians he is not sacred; and this is the appearance which he\r\npresents: he is four-footed, cloven-hoofed like an ox, flat-nosed, with\r\na mane like a horse and showing teeth like tusks, with a tail and voice\r\nlike a horse and in size as large as the largest ox; and his hide is\r\nso exceedingly thick that when it has been dried shafts of javelins are\r\nmade of it. There are moreover otters in the river, which they consider\r\nto be sacred: and of fish also they esteem that which is called the\r\n_lepidotos_ to be sacred, and also the eel; and these they say are\r\nsacred to the Nile: and of birds the fox-goose.\r\n\r\nThere is also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I did not\r\nmyself see except in painting, for in truth he comes to them very\r\nrarely, at intervals, as the people of Heliopolis say, of five hundred\r\nyears; and these say that he comes regularly when his father dies; and\r\nif he be like the painting he is of this size and nature, that is to\r\nsay, some of his feathers are of gold colour and others red, and in\r\noutline and size he is as nearly as possible like an eagle. This bird\r\nthey say (but I cannot believe the story) contrives as follows:--setting\r\nforth from Arabia he conveys his father, they say, to the temple of the\r\nSun (Helios) plastered up in myrrh, and buries him in the temple of the\r\nSun; and he conveys him thus:--he forms first an egg of myrrh as large\r\nas he is able to carry, and then he makes trial of carrying it, and when\r\nhe has made trial sufficiently, then he hollows out the egg and places\r\nhis father within it and plasters over with other myrrh that part of the\r\negg where he hollowed it out to put his father in, and when his father\r\nis laid in it, it proves (they say) to be of the same weight as it was;\r\nand after he has plastered it up, he conveys the whole to Egypt to the\r\ntemple of the Sun. Thus they say that this bird does.\r\n\r\nThere are also about Thebes sacred serpents, not at all harmful to men,\r\nwhich are small in size and have two horns growing from the top of the\r\nhead: these they bury when they die in the temple of Zeus, for to this\r\ngod they say that they are sacred. There is a region moreover in Arabia,\r\nsituated nearly over against the city of Buto, to which place I came to\r\ninquire about the winged serpents: and when I came thither I saw bones\r\nof serpents and spines in quantity so great that it is impossible to\r\nmake report of the number, and there were heaps of spines, some heaps\r\nlarge and others less large and others smaller still than these, and\r\nthese heaps were many in number. This region in which the spines are\r\nscattered upon the ground is of the nature of an entrance from a narrow\r\nmountain pass to a great plain, which plain adjoins the plain in Egypt;\r\nand the story goes that at the beginning of spring winged serpents from\r\nArabia fly towards Egypt, and the birds called ibises meet them at the\r\nentrance to this country and do not suffer the serpents to go by but\r\nkill them. On account of this deed it is (say the Arabians) that the\r\nibis has come to be greatly honoured by the Egyptians, and the Egyptians\r\nalso agree that it is for this reason that they honour these birds. The\r\noutward form of the ibis is this:--it is a deep black all over, and has\r\nlegs like those of a crane and a very curved beak, and in size it is\r\nabout equal to a rail: this is the appearance of the black kind which\r\nfight with the serpents, but of those which most crowd round men's feet\r\n(for there are two several kinds of ibises) the head is bare and also\r\nthe whole of the throat, and it is white in feathering except the head\r\nand neck and the extremities of the wings and the rump (in all these\r\nparts of which I have spoken it is a deep black), while in legs and in\r\nthe form of the head it resembles the other. As for the serpent its form\r\nis like that of the watersnake; and it has wings not feathered but most\r\nnearly resembling the wings of the bat. Let so much suffice as has been\r\nsaid now concerning sacred animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the Egyptians themselves, those who dwell in the part of Egypt which\r\nis sown for crops practise memory more than any other men and are\r\nthe most learned in history by far of all those of whom I have\r\nhad experience: and their manner of life is as follows:--For three\r\nsuccessive days in each month they purge, hunting after health with\r\nemetics and clysters, and they think that all the diseases which exist\r\nare produced in men by the food on which they live: for the Egyptians\r\nare from other causes also the most healthy of all men next after the\r\nLibyans (in my opinion on account of the seasons, because the seasons\r\ndo not change, for by the changes of things generally, and especially\r\nof the seasons, diseases are most apt to be produced in men), and as to\r\ntheir diet, it is as follows:--they eat bread, making loaves of maize,\r\nwhich they call _kyllestis_, and they use habitually a wine made out of\r\nbarley, for vines they have not in their land. Of their fish some they\r\ndry in the sun and then eat them without cooking, others they eat cured\r\nin brine. Of birds they eat quails and ducks and small birds without\r\ncooking, after first curing them; and everything else which they have\r\nbelonging to the class of birds or fishes, except such as have been\r\nset apart by them as sacred, they eat roasted or boiled. In the\r\nentertainments of the rich among them, when they have finished eating, a\r\nman bears round a wooden figure of a dead body in a coffin, made as like\r\nthe reality as may be both by painting and carving, and measuring about\r\na cubit or two cubits each way; and this he shows to each of those who\r\nare drinking together, saying: \"When thou lookest upon this, drink and\r\nbe merry, for thou shalt be such as this when thou art dead.\" Thus they\r\ndo at their carousals. The customs which they practise are derived from\r\ntheir fathers and they do not acquire others in addition; but besides\r\nother customary things among them which are worthy of mention, they have\r\none song, that of Linos, the same who is sung of both in Phenicia and in\r\nCyprus and elsewhere, having however a name different according to the\r\nvarious nations. This song agrees exactly with that which the Hellenes\r\nsing calling on the name of Linos, so that besides many other things\r\nabout which I wonder among those matters which concern Egypt, I wonder\r\nespecially about this, namely whence they got the song of Linos. It is\r\nevident however that they have sung this song from immemorial time, and\r\nin the Egyptian tongue Linos is called Maneros. The Egyptians told me\r\nthat he was the only son of him who first became king of Egypt, and that\r\nhe died before his time and was honoured with these lamentations by\r\nthe Egyptians, and that this was their first and only song. In another\r\nrespect the Egyptians are in agreement with some of the Hellenes, namely\r\nwith the Lacedemonians, but not with the rest, that is to say, the\r\nyounger of them when they meet the elder give way and move out of the\r\npath, and when their elders approach, they rise out of their seat. In\r\nthis which follows however they are not in agreement with any of the\r\nHellenes,--instead of addressing one another in the roads they do\r\nreverence, lowering their hand down to their knee. They wear tunics of\r\nlinen about their legs with fringes, which they call _calasiris_; above\r\nthese they have garments of white wool thrown over: woolen garments\r\nhowever are not taken into the temples, nor are they buried with them,\r\nfor this is not permitted by religion. In these points they are in\r\nagreement with the observances called Orphic and Bacchic (which are\r\nreally Egyptian), and also with those of the Pythagoreans, for one who\r\ntakes part in these mysteries is also forbidden by religious rule to be\r\nburied in woolen garments; and about this there is a sacred story told.\r\n\r\nBesides these things the Egyptians have found out also to what god each\r\nmonth and each day belongs, and what fortunes a man will meet with who\r\nis born on any particular day, and how he will die, and what kind of\r\na man he will be: and these inventions were taken up by those of the\r\nHellenes who occupied themselves about poesy. Portents too have been\r\nfound out by them more than by all other men besides; for when a portent\r\nhas happened, they observe and write down the event which comes of it,\r\nand if ever afterwards anything resembling this happens, they believe\r\nthat the event which comes of it will be similar. Their divination is\r\nordered thus:--the art is assigned not to any man but to certain of the\r\ngods, for there are in their land Oracles of Heracles, of Apollo, of\r\nAthene, of Artemis, or Ares, and of Zeus, and moreover that which they\r\nhold most in honour of all, namely the Oracle of Leto which is in the\r\ncity of Buto. The manner of divination however is not established among\r\nthem according to the same fashion everywhere, but is different\r\nin different places. The art of medicine among them is distributed\r\nthus:--each physician is a physician of one disease and of no more; and\r\nthe whole country is full of physicians, for some profess themselves\r\nto be physicians of the eyes, others of the head, others of the teeth,\r\nothers of the affections of the stomach, and others of the more obscure\r\nailments.\r\n\r\nTheir fashions of mourning and of burial are these:--Whenever any\r\nhousehold has lost a man who is of any regard amongst them, the whole\r\nnumber of women of that house forthwith plaster over their heads or even\r\ntheir faces with mud. Then leaving the corpse within the house they go\r\nthemselves to and fro about the city and beat themselves, with their\r\ngarments bound up by a girdle and their breasts exposed, and with them\r\ngo all the women who are related to the dead man, and on the other side\r\nthe men beat themselves, they too having their garments bound up by a\r\ngirdle; and when they have done this, they then convey the body to\r\nthe embalming. In this occupation certain persons employ themselves\r\nregularly and inherit this as a craft. These, whenever a corpse is\r\nconveyed to them, show to those who brought it wooden models of corpses\r\nmade like reality by painting, and the best of the ways of embalming\r\nthey say is that of him whose name I think it impiety to mention when\r\nspeaking of a matter of such a kind; the second which they show is\r\nless good than this and also less expensive; and the third is the least\r\nexpensive of all. Having told them about this, they inquire of them in\r\nwhich way they desire the corpse of their friend to be prepared. Then\r\nthey after they have agreed for a certain price depart out of the way,\r\nand the others being left behind in the buildings embalm according to\r\nthe best of these ways thus:--First with the crooked iron tool they draw\r\nout the brain through the nostrils, extracting it partly thus and partly\r\nby pouring in drugs; and after this with a sharp stone of Ethiopia they\r\nmake a cut along the side and take out the whole contents of the belly,\r\nand when they have cleared out the cavity and cleansed it with palm-wine\r\nthey cleanse it again with spices pounded up: then they fill the belly\r\nwith pure myrrh pounded up and with cassia and other spices except\r\nfrankincense, and sew it together again. Having so done they keep it for\r\nembalming covered up in natron for seventy days, but for a longer time\r\nthan this it is not permitted to embalm it; and when the seventy days\r\nare past, they wash the corpse and roll its whole body up in fine linen\r\ncut into bands, smearing these beneath with gum, which the Egyptians use\r\ngenerally instead of glue. Then the kinsfolk receive it from them and\r\nhave a wooden figure made in the shape of a man, and when they have had\r\nthis made they enclose the corpse, and having shut it up within, they\r\nstore it then in a sepulchral chamber, setting it to stand upright\r\nagainst the wall. Thus they deal with the corpses which are prepared in\r\nthe most costly way; but for those who desire the middle way and wish\r\nto avoid great cost they prepare the corpse as follows:--having filled\r\ntheir syringes with the oil which is got from cedar-wood, with this they\r\nforthwith fill the belly of the corpse, and this they do without having\r\neither cut it open or taken out the bowels, but they inject the oil by\r\nthe breech, and having stopped the drench from returning back they keep\r\nit then the appointed number of days for embalming, and on the last\r\nof the days they let the cedar oil come out from the belly, which they\r\nbefore put in; and it has such power that it brings out with it the\r\nbowels and interior organs of the body dissolved; and the natron\r\ndissolves the flesh, so that there is left of the corpse only the skin\r\nand the bones. When they have done this they give back the corpse at\r\nonce in that condition without working upon it any more. The third kind\r\nof embalming, by which are prepared the bodies of those who have less\r\nmeans, is as follows:--they cleanse out the belly with a purge and then\r\nkeep the body for embalming during the seventy days, and at once after\r\nthat they give it back to the bringers to carry away. The wives of men\r\nof rank when they die are not given at once to be embalmed, nor such\r\nwomen as are very beautiful or of greater regard than others, but on\r\nthe third or fourth day after their death (and not before) they are\r\ndelivered to the embalmers. They do so about this matter in order that\r\nthe embalmers may not abuse their women, for they say that one of them\r\nwas taken once doing so to the corpse of a woman lately dead, and his\r\nfellow-craftsman gave information. Whenever any one, either of the\r\nEgyptians themselves or of strangers, is found to have been carried off\r\nby a crocodile or brought to his death by the river itself, the people\r\nof any city by which he may have been cast up on land must embalm him\r\nand lay him out in the fairest way they can and bury him in a sacred\r\nburial-place, nor may any of his relations or friends besides touch him,\r\nbut the priests of the Nile themselves handle the corpse and bury it as\r\nthat of one who was something more than man.\r\n\r\nHellenic usages they will by no means follow, and to speak generally\r\nthey follow those of no other men whatever. This rule is observed by\r\nmost of the Egyptians; but there is a large city named Chemmis in the\r\nTheban district near Neapolis, and in this city there is a temple of\r\nPerseus the son of Danae which is of a square shape, and round it grow\r\ndate-palms: the gateway of the temple is built of stone and of very\r\ngreat size, and at the entrance of it stand two great statues of stone.\r\nWithin this enclosure is a temple-house and in it stands an image of\r\nPerseus. These people of Chemmis say that Perseus is wont often to\r\nappear in their land and often within the temple, and that a sandal\r\nwhich has been worn by him is found sometimes, being in length two\r\ncubits, and whenever this appears all Egypt prospers. This they say, and\r\nthey do in honour of Perseus after Hellenic fashion thus,--they hold an\r\nathletic contest, which includes the whole list of games, and they offer\r\nin prizes cattle and cloaks and skins: and when I inquired why to them\r\nalone Perseus was wont to appear, and wherefore they were separated from\r\nall the other Egyptians in that they held an athletic contest, they said\r\nthat Perseus had been born of their city, for Danaos and Lynkeus were\r\nmen of Chemmis and had sailed to Hellas, and from them they traced a\r\ndescent and came down to Perseus: and they told me that he had come to\r\nEgypt for the reason which the Hellenes also say, namely to bring from\r\nLibya the Gorgon's head, and had then visited them also and recognised\r\nall his kinsfolk, and they said that he had well learnt the name of\r\nChemmis before he came to Egypt, since he had heard it from his mother,\r\nand that they celebrated an athletic contest for him by his own command.\r\n\r\nAll these are customs practised by the Egyptians who dwell above the\r\nfens: and those who are settled in the fenland have the same customs for\r\nthe most part as the other Egyptians, both in other matters and also\r\nin that they live each with one wife only, as do the Hellenes; but\r\nfor economy in respect of food they have invented these things\r\nbesides:--when the river has become full and the plains have been\r\nflooded, there grow in the water great numbers of lilies, which the\r\nEgyptians call _lotos_; these they cut with a sickle and dry in the\r\nsun, and then they pound that which grows in the middle of the lotos and\r\nwhich is like the head of a poppy, and they make of it loaves baked\r\nwith fire. The root also of this lotos is edible and has a rather sweet\r\ntaste: it is round in shape and about the size of an apple. There are\r\nother lilies too, in flower resembling roses, which also grow in\r\nthe river, and from them the fruit is produced in a separate vessel\r\nspringing from the root by the side of the plant itself, and very\r\nnearly resembles a wasp's comb: in this there grow edible seeds in great\r\nnumbers of the size of an olive-stone, and they are eaten either fresh\r\nor dried. Besides this they pull up from the fens the papyrus which\r\ngrows every year, and the upper parts of it they cut off and turn to\r\nother uses, but that which is left below for about a cubit in length\r\nthey eat or sell: and those who desire to have the papyrus at its very\r\nbest bake it in an oven heated red-hot, and then eat it. Some too of\r\nthese people live on fish alone, which they dry in the sun after having\r\ncaught them and taken out the entrails, and then when they are dry, they\r\nuse them for food.\r\n\r\nFish which swim in shoals are not much produced in the rivers, but are\r\nbred in the lakes, and they do as follows:--When there comes upon them\r\nthe desire to breed, they swim out in shoals towards the sea; and the\r\nmales lead the way shedding forth their milt as they go, while the\r\nfemales, coming after and swallowing it up, from it become impregnated:\r\nand when they have become full of young in the sea they swim up back\r\nagain, each shoal to its own haunts. The same however no longer lead the\r\nway as before, but the lead comes now to the females, and they leading\r\nthe way in shoals do just as the males did, that is to say they shed\r\nforth their eggs by a few grains at a time, and the males coming after\r\nswallow them up. Now these grains are fish, and from the grains which\r\nsurvive and are not swallowed, the fish grow which afterwards are bred\r\nup. Now those of the fish which are caught as they swim out towards the\r\nsea are found to be rubbed on the left side of the head, but those which\r\nare caught as they swim up again are rubbed on the right side. This\r\nhappens to them because as they swim down to the sea they keep close to\r\nthe land on the left side of the river, and again as they swim up they\r\nkeep to the same side, approaching and touching the bank as much as they\r\ncan, for fear doubtless of straying from their course by reason of the\r\nstream. When the Nile begins to swell, the hollow places of the land\r\nand the depressions by the side of the river first begin to fill, as the\r\nwater soaks through from the river, and so soon as they become full of\r\nwater, at once they are all filled with little fishes; and whence\r\nthese are in all likelihood produced, I think that I perceive. In the\r\npreceding year, when the Nile goes down, the fish first lay eggs in the\r\nmud and then retire with the last of the retreating waters; and when\r\nthe time comes round again, and the water once more comes over the land,\r\nfrom these eggs forthwith are produced the fishes of which I speak.\r\n\r\nThus it is as regards the fish. And for anointing those of the Egyptians\r\nwho dwell in the fens use oil from the castor-berry, which oil the\r\nEgyptians call _kiki_, and thus they do:--they sow along the banks\r\nof the rivers and pools these plants, which in a wild form grow of\r\nthemselves in the land of the Hellenes; these are sown in Egypt and\r\nproduce berries in great quantity but of an evil smell; and when they\r\nhave gathered these some cut them up and press the oil from them, others\r\nagain roast them first and then boil them down and collect that which\r\nruns away from them. The oil is fat and not less suitable for burning\r\nthan olive-oil, but it gives forth a disagreeable smell. Against the\r\ngnats, which are very abundant, they have contrived as follows:--those\r\nwho dwell above the fen-land are helped by the towers, to which they\r\nascend when they go to rest; for the gnats by reason of the winds\r\nare not able to fly up high: but those who dwell in the fenland have\r\ncontrived another way instead of the towers, and this it is:--every man\r\nof them has got a casting net, with which by day he catches fish, but\r\nin the night he uses it for this purpose, that is to say he puts the\r\ncasting-net round about the bed in which he sleeps, and then creeps in\r\nunder it and goes to sleep: and the gnats, if he sleeps rolled up in a\r\ngarment or a linen sheet, bite through these, but through the net they\r\ndo not even attempt to bite.\r\n\r\nTheir boats with which they carry cargoes are made of the thorny acacia,\r\nof which the form is very like that of the Kyrenian lotos, and that\r\nwhich exudes from it is gum. From this tree they cut pieces of wood\r\nabout two cubits in length and arrange them like bricks, fastening\r\nthe boat together by running a great number of long bolts through the\r\ntwo-cubits pieces; and when they have thus fastened the boat together,\r\nthey lay cross-pieces over the top, using no ribs for the sides; and\r\nwithin they caulk the seams with papyrus. They make one steering-oar for\r\nit, which is passed through the bottom of the boat; and they have a mast\r\nof acacia and sails of papyrus. These boats cannot sail up the river\r\nunless there be a very fresh wind blowing, but are towed from the shore:\r\ndown-stream however they travel as follows:--they have a door-shaped\r\ncrate made of tamarisk wood and reed mats sewn together, and also a\r\nstone of about two talents weight bored with a hole; and of these the\r\nboatman lets the crate float on in front of the boat, fastened with a\r\nrope, and the stone drags behind by another rope. The crate then, as the\r\nforce of the stream presses upon it, goes on swiftly and draws on the\r\n_baris_ (for so these boats are called), while the stone dragging after\r\nit behind and sunk deep in the water keeps its course straight. These\r\nboats they have in great numbers and some of them carry many thousands\r\nof talents' burden.\r\n\r\nWhen the Nile comes over the land, the cities alone are seen rising\r\nabove the water, resembling more nearly than anything else the islands\r\nin the Egean Sea; for the rest of Egypt becomes a sea and the cities\r\nalone rise above water. Accordingly, whenever this happens, they pass\r\nby water not now by the channels of the river but over the midst of\r\nthe plain: for example, as one sails up from Naucratis to Memphis the\r\npassage is then close by the pyramids, whereas the usual passage is not\r\nthe same even here, but goes by the point of the Delta and the city of\r\nKercasoros; while if you sail over the plain to Naucratis from the sea\r\nand from Canobos, you will go by Anthylla and the city called after\r\nArchander. Of these Anthylla is a city of note and is especially\r\nassigned to the wife of him who reigns over Egypt, to supply her with\r\nsandals, (this is the case since the time when Egypt came to be\r\nunder the Persians): the other city seems to me to have its name from\r\nArchander the son-in-law of Danaos, who was the son of Phthios, the son\r\nof Achaios; for it is called the City of Archander. There might indeed\r\nby another Archander, but in any case the name is not Egyptian.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto my own observation and judgment and inquiry are the vouchers\r\nfor that which I have said; but from this point onwards I am about to\r\ntell the history of Egypt according to that which I have heard, to which\r\nwill be added also something of that which I have myself seen.\r\n\r\nOf Min, who first became king of Egypt, the priests said that on the\r\none hand he banked off the site of Memphis from the river: for the whole\r\nstream of the river used to flow along by the sandy mountain-range on\r\nthe side of Libya, but Min formed by embankments that bend of the river\r\nwhich lies to the South about a hundred furlongs above Memphis, and thus\r\nhe dried up the old stream and conducted the river so that it flowed in\r\nthe middle between the mountains: and even now this bend of the Nile is\r\nby the Persians kept under very careful watch, that it may flow in the\r\nchannel to which it is confined, and the bank is repaired every year;\r\nfor if the river should break through and overflow in this direction,\r\nMemphis would be in danger of being overwhelmed by flood. When this Min,\r\nwho first became king, had made into dry land the part which was dammed\r\noff, on the one hand, I say, he founded in it that city which is now\r\ncalled Memphis; for Memphis too is in the narrow part of Egypt;\r\nand outside the city he dug round it on the North and West a lake\r\ncommunicating with the river, for the side towards the East is barred by\r\nthe Nile itself. Then secondly he established in the city the temple of\r\nHephaistos a great work and most worthy of mention. After this man the\r\npriests enumerated to me from a papyrus roll the names of other kings,\r\nthree hundred and thirty in number; and in all these generations of men\r\neighteen were Ethiopians, one was a woman, a native Egyptian, and\r\nthe rest were men and of Egyptian race: and the name of the woman who\r\nreigned was the same as that of the Babylonian queen, namely Nitocris.\r\nOf her they said that desiring to take vengeance for her brother, whom\r\nthe Egyptians had slain when he was their king and then, after having\r\nslain him, had given his kingdom to her,--desiring, I say, to take\r\nvengeance for him, she destroyed by craft many of the Egyptians. For she\r\ncaused to be constructed a very large chamber under ground, and making\r\nas though she would handsel it but in her mind devising other things,\r\nshe invited those of the Egyptians whom she knew to have had most part\r\nin the murder, and gave a great banquet. Then while they were feasting,\r\nshe let in the river upon them by a secret conduit of large size. Of\r\nher they told no more than this, except that, when this had been\r\naccomplished, she threw herself into a room full of embers, in order\r\nthat she might escape vengeance. As for the other kings, they could tell\r\nme of no great works which had been produced by them, and they said that\r\nthey had no renown except only the last of them, Moiris: he (they\r\nsaid) produced as a memorial of himself the gateway of the temple of\r\nHephaistos which is turned towards the North Wind, and dug a lake, about\r\nwhich I shall set forth afterwards how many furlongs of circuit it has,\r\nand in it built pyramids of the size which I shall mention at the same\r\ntime when I speak of the lake itself. He, they said, produced these\r\nworks, but of the rest none produced any.\r\n\r\nTherefore passing these by I will make mention of the king who came\r\nafter these, whose name is Sesostris. He (the priests said) first of all\r\nset out with ships of war from the Arabian gulf and subdued those who\r\ndwelt by the shores of the Erythraian Sea, until as he sailed he came\r\nto a sea which could no further be navigated by reason of shoals: then\r\nsecondly, after he had returned to Egypt, according to the report of the\r\npriests he took a great army and marched over the continent, subduing\r\nevery nation which stood in his way: and those of them whom he found\r\nvaliant and fighting desperately for their freedom, in their lands he\r\nset up pillars which told by inscriptions his own name and the name of\r\nhis country, and how he had subdued them by his power; but as to those\r\nof whose cities he obtained possession without fighting or with ease, on\r\ntheir pillars he inscribed words after the same tenor as he did for the\r\nnations which had shown themselves courageous, and in addition he drew\r\nupon them the hidden parts of a woman, desiring to signify by this that\r\nthe people were cowards and effeminate. Thus doing he traversed the\r\ncontinent, until at last he passed over to Europe from Asia and subdued\r\nthe Scythians and also the Thracians. These, I am of opinion, were the\r\nfurthest people to which the Egyptian army came, for in their country\r\nthe pillars are found to have been set up, but in the land beyond this\r\nthey are no longer found. From this point he turned and began to go\r\nback; and when he came to the river Phasis, what happened then I cannot\r\nsay for certain, whether the king Sesostris himself divided off a\r\ncertain portion of his army and left the men there as settlers in\r\nthe land, or whether some of his soldiers were wearied by his distant\r\nmarches and remained by the river Phasis. For the people of Colchis are\r\nevidently Egyptian, and this I perceived for myself before I heard it\r\nfrom others. So when I had come to consider the matter I asked them\r\nboth; and the Colchians had remembrance of the Egyptians more than the\r\nEgyptians of the Colchians; but the Egyptians said they believed that\r\nthe Colchians were a portion of the army of Sesostris. That this was\r\nso I conjectured myself not only because they are dark-skinned and have\r\ncurly hair (this of itself amounts to nothing, for there are other races\r\nwhich are so), but also still more because the Colchians, Egyptians,\r\nand Ethiopians alone of all the races of men have practised circumcision\r\nfrom the first. The Phenicians and the Syrians who dwell in Palestine\r\nconfess themselves that they have learnt it from the Egyptians, and\r\nthe Syrians about the river Thermodon and the river Parthenios, and the\r\nMacronians, who are their neighbors, say that they have learnt it\r\nlately from the Colchians. These are the only races of men who practise\r\ncircumcision, and these evidently practise it in the same manner as the\r\nEgyptians. Of the Egyptians themselves however and the Ethiopians, I\r\nam not able to say which learnt from the other, for undoubtedly it is a\r\nmost ancient custom; but that the other nations learnt it by intercourse\r\nwith the Egyptians, this among others is to me a strong proof, namely\r\nthat those of the Phenicians who have intercourse with Hellas cease\r\nto follow the example of the Egyptians in this matter, and do not\r\ncircumcise their children. Now let me tell another thing about the\r\nColchians to show how they resemble the Egyptians:--they alone work flax\r\nin the same fashion as the Egyptians, and the two nations are like one\r\nanother in their whole manner of living and also in their language: now\r\nthe linen of Colchis is called by the Hellenes Sardonic, whereas that\r\nfrom Egypt is called Egyptian. The pillars which Sesostris king of Egypt\r\nset up in the various countries are for the most part no longer to be\r\nseen extant; but in Syria Palestine I myself saw them existing with the\r\ninscription upon them which I have mentioned and the emblem. Moreover\r\nin Ionia there are two figures of this man carved upon rocks, one on\r\nthe road by which one goes from the land of Ephesos to Phocaia, and the\r\nother on the road from Sardis to Smyrna. In each place there is a figure\r\nof a man cut in the rock, of four cubits and a span in height, holding\r\nin his right hand a spear and in his left a bow and arrows, and the\r\nother equipment which he has is similar to this, for it is both Egyptian\r\nand Ethiopian: and from the one shoulder to the other across the breast\r\nruns an inscription carved in sacred Egyptian characters, saying thus,\r\n\"This land with my shoulders I won for myself.\" But who he is and from\r\nwhence, he does not declare in these places, though in other places he\r\nhad declared this. Some of those who have seen these carvings conjecture\r\nthat the figure is that of Memnon, but herein they are very far from the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nAs this Egyptian Sesostris was returning and bringing back many men of\r\nthe nations whose lands he had subdued, when he came (said the priests)\r\nto Daphnai in the district of Pelusion on his journey home, his brother\r\nto whom Sesostris had entrusted the charge of Egypt invited him and\r\nwith him his sons to a feast; and then he piled the house round with\r\nbrushwood and set it on fire: and Sesostris when he discovered this\r\nforthwith took counsel with his wife, for he was bringing with him (they\r\nsaid) his wife also; and she counselled him to lay out upon the pyre two\r\nof his sons, which were six in number, and so to make a bridge over\r\nthe burning mass, and that they passing over their bodies should thus\r\nescape. This, they said, Sesostris did, and two of his sons were burnt\r\nto death in this manner, but the rest got away safe with their father.\r\nThen Sesostris, having returned to Egypt and having taken vengeance on\r\nhis brother employed the multitude which he had brought in of those\r\nwhose lands he had subdued, as follows:--these were they who drew the\r\nstones which in the reign of this king were brought to the temple of\r\nHephaistos, being of very good size; and also these were compelled to\r\ndig all the channels which now are in Egypt; and thus (having no such\r\npurpose) they caused Egypt, which before was all fit for riding and\r\ndriving, to be no longer fit for this from thenceforth: for from that\r\ntime forward Egypt, though it is plain land, has become all unfit for\r\nriding and driving, and the cause has been these channels, which are\r\nmany and run in all directions. But the reason why the king cut up\r\nthe land was this, namely because those of the Egyptians who had their\r\ncities not on the river but in the middle of the country, being in want\r\nof water when the river went down from them, found their drink brackish\r\nbecause they had it from wells. For this reason Egypt was cut up: and\r\nthey said that this king distributed the land to all the Egyptians,\r\ngiving an equal square portion to each man, and from this he made his\r\nrevenue, having appointed them to pay a certain rent every year: and\r\nif the river should take away anything from any man's portion, he would\r\ncome to the king and declare that which had happened, and the king used\r\nto send men to examine and to find out by measurement how much less the\r\npiece of land had become, in order that for the future the man might pay\r\nless, in proportion to the rent appointed: and I think that thus the art\r\nof geometry was found out and afterwards came into Hellas also. For as\r\ntouching the sun-dial and the gnomon and the twelve divisions of the\r\nday, they were learnt by the Hellenes from the Babylonians. He moreover\r\nalone of all the Egyptian kings had rule over Ethiopia; and he left\r\nas memorials of himself in front of the temple of Hephaistos two stone\r\nstatues of thirty cubits each, representing himself and his wife,\r\nand others of twenty cubits each representing his four sons: and long\r\nafterwards the priest of Hephaistos refused to permit Dareios the\r\nPersian to set up a statue of himself in front of them, saying that\r\ndeeds had not been done by him equal to those which were done by\r\nSesostris the Egyptian; for Sesostris had subdued other nations besides,\r\nnot fewer than he, and also the Scythians; but Dareios had not been able\r\nto conquer the Scythians: wherefore it was not just that he should set\r\nup a statue in front of those which Sesostris had dedicated, if he did\r\nnot surpass him in his deeds. Which speech, they say, Dareios took in\r\ngood part.\r\n\r\nNow after Sesostris had brought his life to an end, his son Pheros,\r\nthey told me, received in succession the kingdom, and he made no warlike\r\nexpedition, and moreover it chanced to him to become blind by reason of\r\nthe following accident:--when the river had come down in flood rising to\r\na height of eighteen cubits, higher than ever before that time, and had\r\ngone over the fields, a wind fell upon it and the river became agitated\r\nby waves: and this king (they say) moved by presumptuous folly took\r\na spear and cast it into the midst of the eddies of the stream; and\r\nimmediately upon this he had a disease of the eyes and was by it made\r\nblind. For ten years then he was blind, and in the eleventh year there\r\ncame to him an oracle from the city of Buto saying that the time of his\r\npunishment had expired, and that he should see again if he washed his\r\neyes with the water of a woman who had accompanied with her own husband\r\nonly and had not had knowledge of other men: and first he made trial of\r\nhis own wife, and then, as he continued blind, he went on to try all the\r\nwomen in turn; and when he had at least regained his sight he gathered\r\ntogether all the women of whom he had made trial, excepting her by\r\nwhose means he had regained his sight, to one city which now is named\r\nErythrabolos, and having gathered them to this he consumed them all by\r\nfire, as well as the city itself; but as for her by whose means he\r\nhad regained his sight, he had her himself to wife. Then after he had\r\nescaped the malady of his eyes he dedicated offerings at each one of the\r\ntemples which were of renown, and especially (to mention only that which\r\nis most worthy of mention) he dedicated at the temple of the Sun works\r\nwhich are worth seeing, namely two obelisks of stone, each of a single\r\nblock, measuring in length a hundred cubits each one and in breadth\r\neight cubits.\r\n\r\nAfter him, they said, there succeeded to the throne a man of Memphis,\r\nwhose name in the tongue of the Hellenes was Proteus; for whom there is\r\nnow a sacred enclosure at Memphis, very fair and well ordered, lying on\r\nthat side of the temple of Hephaistos which faces the North Wind. Round\r\nabout this enclosure dwell Phenicians of Tyre, and this whole region is\r\ncalled the Camp of the Tyrians. Within the enclosure of Proteus there\r\nis a temple called the temple of the \"foreign Aphrodite,\" which temple\r\nI conjecture to be one of Helen the daughter of Tyndareus, not only\r\nbecause I have heard the tale how Helen dwelt with Proteus, but also\r\nespecially because it is called by the name of the \"foreign Aphrodite,\"\r\nfor the other temples of Aphrodite which there are have none of them the\r\naddition of the word \"foreign\" to the name.\r\n\r\nAnd the priests told me, when I inquired, that the things concerning\r\nHelen happened thus:--Alexander having carried off Helen was sailing\r\naway from Sparta to his own land, and when he had come to the Egean Sea\r\ncontrary winds drove him from his course to the Sea of Egypt; and after\r\nthat, since the blasts did not cease to blow, he came to Egypt itself,\r\nand in Egypt to that which is now named the Canobic mouth of the Nile\r\nand to Taricheiai. Now there was upon the shore, as still there is now,\r\na temple of Heracles, in which if any man's slave take refuge and have\r\nthe sacred marks set upon him, giving himself over to the god, it is\r\nnot lawful to lay hands upon him; but this custom has continued still\r\nunchanged from the beginning down to my own time. Accordingly the\r\nattendants of Alexander, having heard of the custom which existed about\r\nthe temple, ran away from him, and sitting down as suppliants of the\r\ngod, accused Alexander, because they desired to do him hurt, telling\r\nthe whole tale how things were about Helen and about the wrong done to\r\nMenalaos; and this accusation they made not only to the priests but also\r\nto the warden of this river-mouth, whose name was Thonis. Thonis then\r\nhaving heard their tale sent forthwith a message to Proteus at Memphis,\r\nwhich said as follows: \"There hath come a stranger, a Teucrian by race,\r\nwho hath done in Hellas an unholy deed; for he hath deceived the wife\r\nof his own host, and is come hither bringing with him this woman herself\r\nand very much wealth, having been carried out of his way by winds to thy\r\nland. Shall we then allow him to sail out unharmed, or shall we first\r\ntake away from him that which he brought with him?\" In reply to this\r\nProteus sent back a messenger who said thus: \"Seize this man, whosoever\r\nhe may be, who has done impiety to his own host, and bring him away into\r\nmy presence that I may know what he will find to say.\" Hearing this,\r\nThonis seized Alexander and detained his ships, and after that he\r\nbrought the man himself up to Memphis and with him Helen and the wealth\r\nhe had, and also in addition to them the suppliants. So when all had\r\nbeen conveyed up thither, Proteus began to ask Alexander who he was and\r\nfrom whence he was voyaging; and he both recounted to him his descent\r\nand told him the name of his native land, and moreover related of his\r\nvoyage, from whence he was sailing. After this Proteus asked him whence\r\nhe had taken Helen; and when Alexander went astray in his account and did\r\nnot speak the truth, those who had become suppliants convicted him of\r\nfalsehood, relating in full the whole tale of the wrong done. At length\r\nProteus declared to them this sentence, saying, \"Were it not that I\r\ncount it a matter of great moment not to slay any of those strangers who\r\nbeing driven from their course by winds have come to my land hitherto,\r\nI should have taken vengeance on thee on behalf of the man of\r\nHellas, seeing that thou, most base of men, having received from him\r\nhospitality, didst work against him a most impious deed. For thou didst\r\ngo in to the wife of thine own host; and even this was not enough for\r\nthee, but thou didst stir her up with desire and hast gone away with her\r\nlike a thief. Moreover not even this by itself was enough for thee, but\r\nthou art come hither with plunder taken from the house of thy host. Now\r\ntherefore depart, seeing that I have counted it of great moment not to\r\nbe a slayer of strangers. This woman indeed and the wealth which thou\r\nhast I will not allow thee to carry away, but I shall keep them safe for\r\nthe Hellene who was thy host, until he come himself and desire to carry\r\nthem off to his home; to thyself however and thy fellow-voyagers I\r\nproclaim that ye depart from your anchoring within three days and go\r\nfrom my land to some other; and if not, that ye will be dealt with as\r\nenemies.\"\r\n\r\nThis the priests said was the manner of Helen's coming to Proteus; and\r\nI suppose that Homer also had heard this story, but since it was not so\r\nsuitable to the composition of his poem as the other which he followed,\r\nhe dismissed it finally, making it clear at the same time that he was\r\nacquainted with that story also: and according to the manner in which he\r\ndescribed the wanderings of Alexander in the Iliad (nor did he elsewhere\r\nretract that which he had said) of his course, wandering to various\r\nlands, and that he came among other places to Sidon in Phenicia. Of this\r\nthe poet has made mention in the \"prowess of Diomede,\" and the verses\r\nrun thus:\r\n\r\n     \"There she had robes many-coloured, the works of women of Sidon,\r\n     Those whom her son himself the god-like of form Alexander\r\n     Carried from Sidon, what time the broad sea-path he sailed over\r\n     Bringing back Helene home, of a noble father begotten.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in the Odyssey also he has made mention of it in these verses:\r\n\r\n     \"Such had the daughter of Zeus, such drugs of exquisite cunning,\r\n     Good, which to her the wife of Thon, Polydamna, had given,\r\n     Dwelling in Egypt, the land where the bountiful meadow produces\r\n     Drugs more than all lands else, many good being mixed, many evil.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus too Menelaos says to Telemachos:\r\n\r\n     \"Still the gods stayed me in Egypt, to come back hither desiring,\r\n     Stayed me from voyaging home, since sacrifice due I performed not.\"\r\n\r\nIn these lines he makes it clear that he knew of the wanderings of\r\nAlexander to Egypt, for Syria borders upon Egypt and the Phenicians, of\r\nwhom is Sidon, dwell in Syria. By these lines and by this passage it is\r\nalso most clearly shown that the \"Cyprian Epic\" was not written by Homer\r\nbut by some other man: for in this it is said that on the third day\r\nafter leaving Sparta Alexander came to Ilion bringing with him Helen,\r\nhaving had a \"gently-blowing wind and a smooth sea,\" whereas in the\r\nIliad it says that he wandered from his course when he brought her.\r\n\r\nLet us now leave Homer and the \"Cyprian Epic\"; but this I will say,\r\nnamely that I asked the priests whether it is but an idle tale which\r\nthe Hellenes tell of that which they say happened about Ilion; and they\r\nanswered me thus, saying that they had their knowledge by inquiries from\r\nMenelaos himself. After the rape of Helen there came indeed, they said,\r\nto the Teucrian land a large army of Hellenes to help Menelaos; and\r\nwhen the army had come out of the ships to land and had pitched its\r\ncamp there, they sent messengers to Ilion, with whom went also Menelaos\r\nhimself; and when these entered within the wall they demanded back Helen\r\nand the wealth which Alexander had stolen from Menelaos and had taken\r\naway; and moreover they demanded satisfaction for the wrongs done: and\r\nthe Teucrians told the same tale then and afterwards, both with oath and\r\nwithout oath, namely that in deed and in truth they had not Helen nor\r\nthe wealth for which demand was made, but that both were in Egypt; and\r\nthat they could not justly be compelled to give satisfaction for that\r\nwhich Proteus the king of Egypt had. The Hellenes however thought that\r\nthey were being mocked by them and besieged the city, until at last they\r\ntook it; and when they had taken the wall and did not find Helen, but\r\nheard the same tale as before, then they believed the former tale and\r\nsent Menelaos himself to Proteus. And Menelaos having come to Egypt and\r\nhaving sailed up to Memphis, told the truth of these matters, and not\r\nonly found great entertainment, but also received Helen unhurt, and\r\nall his own wealth besides. Then, however, after he had been thus dealt\r\nwith, Menelaos showed himself ungrateful to the Egyptians; for when\r\nhe set forth to sail away, contrary winds detained him, and as this\r\ncondition of things lasted long, he devised an impious deed; for he took\r\ntwo children of natives and made sacrifice of them. After this, when it\r\nwas known that he had done so, he became abhorred, and being pursued he\r\nescaped and got away in his ships to Libya; but whither he went besides\r\nafter this, the Egyptians were not able to tell. Of these things they\r\nsaid that they found out part by inquiries, and the rest, namely that\r\nwhich happened in their own land, they related from sure and certain\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nThus the priests of the Egyptians told me; and I myself also agree with\r\nthe story which was told of Helen, adding this consideration, namely\r\nthat if Helen had been in Ilion she would have been given up to the\r\nHellenes, whether Alexander consented or no; for Priam assuredly was not\r\nso mad, nor yet the others of his house, that they were desirous to run\r\nrisk of ruin for themselves and their children and their city, in order\r\nthat Alexander might have Helen as his wife: and even supposing that\r\nduring the first part of the time they had been so inclined, yet when\r\nmany others of the Trojans besides were losing their lives as often as\r\nthey fought with the Hellenes, and of the sons of Priam himself always\r\ntwo or three or even more were slain when a battle took place (if one\r\nmay trust at all to the Epic poets),--when, I say, things were coming\r\nthus to pass, I consider that even if Priam himself had had Helen as his\r\nwife, he would have given her back to the Achaians, if at least by so\r\ndoing he might be freed from the evils which oppressed him. Nor even\r\nwas the kingdom coming to Alexander next, so that when Priam was old the\r\ngovernment was in his hands; but Hector, who was both older and more\r\nof a man than he, would certainly have received it after the death of\r\nPriam; and him it behoved not to allow his brother to go on with his\r\nwrong-doing, considering that great evils were coming to pass on his\r\naccount both to himself privately and in general to the other Trojans.\r\nIn truth however they lacked the power to give Helen back; and the\r\nHellenes did not believe them, though they spoke the truth; because,\r\nas I declare my opinion, the divine power was purposing to cause them\r\nutterly to perish, and so make it evident to men that for great wrongs\r\ngreat also are the chastisements which come from the gods. And thus have\r\nI delivered my opinion concerning these matters.\r\n\r\nAfter Proteus, they told me, Rhampsinitos received in succession the\r\nkingdom, who left as a memorial of himself that gateway to the temple of\r\nHephaistos which is turned towards the West, and in front of the gateway\r\nhe set up two statues, in height five-and-twenty cubits, of which the\r\none which stands on the North side is called by the Egyptians Summer and\r\nthe one on the South side Winter; and to that one which they call Summer\r\nthey do reverence and make offerings, while to the other which is called\r\nWinter they do the opposite of these things. This king, they said, got\r\ngreat wealth of silver, which none of the kings born after him could\r\nsurpass or even come near to; and wishing to store his wealth in safety\r\nhe caused to be built a chamber of stone, one of the walls whereof was\r\ntowards the outside of his palace: and the builder of this, having a\r\ndesign against it, contrived as follows, that is, he disposed one of the\r\nstones in such a manner that it could be taken out easily from the wall\r\neither by two men or even by one. So when the chamber was finished, the\r\nking stored his money in it, and after some time the builder, being near\r\nthe end of his life, called to him his sons (for he had two) and to them\r\nhe related how he had contrived in building the treasury of the king,\r\nand all in forethought for them, that they might have ample means of\r\nliving. And when he had clearly set forth to them everything concerning\r\nthe taking out of the stone, he gave them the measurements, saying that\r\nif they paid heed to this matter they would be stewards of the king's\r\ntreasury. So he ended his life, and his sons made no long delay in\r\nsetting to work, but went to the palace by night, and having found the\r\nstone in the wall of the chamber they dealt with it easily and carried\r\nforth for themselves great quantity of the wealth within. And the king\r\nhappening to open the chamber, he marvelled when he saw the vessels\r\nfalling short of the full amount, and he did not know on whom he should\r\nlay the blame, since the seals were unbroken and the chamber had been\r\nclose shut; but when upon his opening the chamber a second and a third\r\ntime the money was each time seen to be diminished, for the thieves\r\ndid not slacken in their assaults upon it, he did as follows:--having\r\nordered traps to be made he set these round about the vessels in which\r\nthe money was; and when the thieves had come as at former times and one\r\nof them had entered, then so soon as he came near to one of the vessels\r\nhe was straightway caught in the trap: and when he perceived in what\r\nevil case he was, straightway calling his brother he showed him what the\r\nmatter was, and bade him enter as quickly as possible and cut off\r\nhis head, for fear lest being seen and known he might bring about the\r\ndestruction of his brother also. And to the other it seemed that he\r\nspoke well, and he was persuaded and did so; and fitting the stone into\r\nits place he departed home bearing with him the head of his brother.\r\nNow when it became day, the king entered into the chamber and was very\r\ngreatly amazed, seeing the body of the thief held in the trap without\r\nhis head, and the chamber unbroken, with no way to come in by or go out:\r\nand being at a loss he hung up the dead body of the thief upon the\r\nwall and set guards there, with charge if they saw any one weeping or\r\nbewailing himself to seize him and bring him before the king. And when\r\nthe dead body had been hung up, the mother was greatly grieved, and\r\nspeaking with the son who survived she enjoined him, in whatever way he\r\ncould, to contrive means by which he might take down and bring home the\r\nbody of his brother; and if he should neglect to do this, she earnestly\r\nthreatened that she would go and give information to the king that he\r\nhad the money. So as the mother dealt hardly with the surviving son, and\r\nhe though saying many things to her did not persuade her, he contrived\r\nfor his purpose a device as follows:--Providing himself with asses he\r\nfilled some skins with wine and laid them upon the asses, and after\r\nthat he drove them along: and when he came opposite to those who were\r\nguarding the corpse hung up, he drew towards him two or three of the\r\nnecks of the skins and loosened the cords with which they were tied.\r\nThen when the wine was running out, he began to beat his head and cry\r\nout loudly, as if he did not know to which of the asses he should first\r\nturn; and when the guards saw the wine flowing out in streams, they ran\r\ntogether to the road with drinking vessels in their hands and collected\r\nthe wine that was poured out, counting it so much gain; and he abused\r\nthem all violently, making as if he were angry, but when the guards\r\ntried to appease him, after a time he feigned to be pacified and to\r\nabate his anger, and at length he drove his asses out of the road and\r\nbegan to set their loads right. Then more talk arose among them, and one\r\nor two of them made jests at him and brought him to laugh with them;\r\nand in the end he made them a present of one of the skins in addition\r\nto what they had. Upon that they lay down there without more ado, being\r\nminded to drink, and they took him into their company and invited him\r\nto remain with them and join them in their drinking: so he (as may be\r\nsupposed) was persuaded and stayed. Then as they in their drinking bade\r\nhim welcome in a friendly manner, he made a present to them also of\r\nanother of the skins; and so at length having drunk liberally the guards\r\nbecame completely intoxicated; and being overcome by sleep they went to\r\nbed on the spot where they had been drinking. He then, as it was now far\r\non in the night, first took down the body of his brother, and then in\r\nmockery shaved the right cheeks of all the guards; and after that he\r\nput the dead body upon the asses and drove them away home, having\r\naccomplished that which was enjoined him by his mother. Upon this the\r\nking, when it was reported to him that the dead body of the thief had\r\nbeen stolen away, displayed great anger; and desiring by all means that\r\nit should be found out who it might be who devised these things, did\r\nthis (so at least they said, but I do not believe the account),--he\r\ncaused his own daughter to sit in the stews, and enjoined her to receive\r\nall equally, and before having commerce with any one to compel him to\r\ntell her what was the most cunning and what the most unholy deed which\r\nhad been done by him in all his life-time; and whosoever should relate\r\nthat which had happened about the thief, him she must seize and not let\r\nhim go out. Then as she was doing that which was enjoined by her father,\r\nthe thief, hearing for what purpose this was done and having a desire to\r\nget the better of the king in resource, did thus:--from the body of one\r\nlately dead he cut off the arm at the shoulder and went with it under\r\nhis mantle: and having gone in to the daughter of the king, and being\r\nasked that which the others also were asked, he related that he had done\r\nthe most unholy deed when he cut off the head of his brother, who had\r\nbeen caught in a trap in the king's treasure-chamber, and the most\r\ncunning deed in that he made drunk the guards and took down the dead\r\nbody of his brother hanging up; and she when she heard it tried to take\r\nhold of him, but the thief held out to her in the darkness the arm of\r\nthe corpse, which she grasped and held, thinking that she was holding\r\nthe arm of the man himself; but the thief left it in her hands and\r\ndeparted, escaping through the door. Now when this also was reported to\r\nthe king, he was at first amazed at the ready invention and daring of\r\nthe fellow, and then afterwards he sent round to all the cities and made\r\nproclamation granting a free pardon to the thief, and also promising a\r\ngreat reward if he would come into his presence. The thief accordingly\r\ntrusting to the proclamation came to the king, and Rhampsinitos greatly\r\nmarvelled at him, and gave him this daughter of his to wife, counting\r\nhim to be the most knowing of all men; for as the Egyptians were\r\ndistinguished from all other men, so was he from the other Egyptians.\r\n\r\nAfter these things they said this king went down alive to that place\r\nwhich by the Hellenes is called Hades, and there played at dice with\r\nDemeter, and in some throws he overcame her and in others he was\r\novercome by her; and he came back again having as a gift from her a\r\nhandkerchief of gold: and they told me that because of the going down of\r\nRhampsinitos the Egyptians after he came back celebrated a feast, which\r\nI know of my own knowledge also that they still observe even to my time;\r\nbut whether it is for this cause that they keep the feast or for\r\nsome other, I am not able to say. However, the priests weave a robe\r\ncompletely on the very day of the feast, and forthwith they bind up the\r\neyes of one of them with a fillet, and having led him with the robe to\r\nthe way by which one goes to the temple of Demeter, they depart back\r\nagain themselves. This priest, they say, with his eyes bound up is led\r\nby two wolves to the temple of Demeter, which is distant from the city\r\ntwenty furlongs, and then afterwards the wolves lead him back again from\r\nthe temple to the same spot. Now as to the tales told by the Egyptians,\r\nany man may accept them to whom such things appear credible; as for me,\r\nit is to be understood throughout the whole of the history that I write\r\nby hearsay that which is reported by the people in each place. The\r\nEgyptians say that Demeter and Dionysos are rulers of the world below;\r\nand the Egyptians are also the first who reported the doctrine that the\r\nsoul of man is immortal, and that when the body dies, the soul enters\r\ninto another creature which chances then to be coming to the birth, and\r\nwhen it has gone the round of all the creatures of land and sea and of\r\nthe air, it enters again into a human body as it comes to the birth;\r\nand that it makes this round in a period of three thousand years. This\r\ndoctrine certain Hellenes adopted, some earlier and some later, as if\r\nit were of their own invention, and of these men I know the names but I\r\nabstain from recording them.\r\n\r\nDown to the time when Rhampsinitos was king, they told me there was in\r\nEgypt nothing but orderly rule, and Egypt prospered greatly; but after\r\nhim Cheops became king over them and brought them to every kind of\r\nevil: for he shut up all the temples, and having first kept them from\r\nsacrifices there, he then bade all the Egyptians work for him. So some\r\nwere appointed to draw stones from the stone-quarries in the Arabian\r\nmountains to the Nile, and others he ordered to receive the stones after\r\nthey had been carried over the river in boats, and to draw them to those\r\nwhich are called the Libyan mountains; and they worked by a hundred\r\nthousand men at a time, for each three months continually. Of this\r\noppression there passed ten years while the causeway was made by which\r\nthey drew the stones, which causeway they built, and it is a work not\r\nmuch less, as it appears to me, than the pyramid; for the length of it\r\nis five furlongs and the breadth ten fathoms and the height, where it\r\nis highest, eight fathoms, and it is made of stone smoothed and with\r\nfigures carved upon it. For this they said, the ten years were spent,\r\nand for the underground he caused to be made as sepulchral chambers for\r\nhimself in an island, having conducted thither a channel from the Nile.\r\nFor the making of the pyramid itself there passed a period of twenty\r\nyears; and the pyramid is square, each side measuring eight hundred\r\nfeet, and the height of it is the same. It is built of stone smoothed\r\nand fitted together in the most perfect manner, not one of the stones\r\nbeing less than thirty feet in length. This pyramid was made after the\r\nmanner of steps which some called \"rows\" and others \"bases\": and when\r\nthey had first made it thus, they raised the remaining stones with\r\nmachines made of short pieces of timber, raising them first from the\r\nground to the first stage of the steps, and when the stone got up to\r\nthis it was placed upon another machine standing on the first stage,\r\nand so from this it was drawn to the second upon another machine; for as\r\nmany as were the courses of the steps, so many machines there were also,\r\nor perhaps they transferred one and the same machine, made so as easily\r\nto be carried, to each stage successively, in order that they might\r\ntake up the stones; for let it be told in both ways, according as it\r\nis reported. However that may be the highest parts of it were finished\r\nfirst, and afterwards they proceeded to finish that which came next to\r\nthem, and lastly they finished the parts of it near the ground and the\r\nlowest ranges. On the pyramid it is declared in Egyptian writing how\r\nmuch was spent on radishes and onions and leeks for the workmen, and if\r\nI rightly remember that which the interpreter said in reading to me this\r\ninscription, a sum of one thousand six hundred talents of silver was\r\nspent; and if this is so, how much besides is likely to have been\r\nexpended upon the iron with which they worked, and upon bread and\r\nclothing for the workmen, seeing that they were building the works for\r\nthe time which has been mentioned and were occupied for no small time\r\nbesides, as I suppose, in the cutting and bringing of the stones and in\r\nworking at the excavation under the ground? Cheops moreover came, they\r\nsaid, to such a pitch of wickedness, that being in want of money he\r\ncaused his own daughter to sit in the stews, and ordered her to obtain\r\nfrom those who came a certain amount of money (how much it was they did\r\nnot tell me): and she not only obtained the sum appointed by her father,\r\nbut also she formed a design for herself privately to leave behind her\r\na memorial, and she requested each man who came in to give her one stone\r\nupon her building: and of these stones, they told me, the pyramid was\r\nbuilt which stands in front of the great pyramid in the middle of the\r\nthree, each side being one hundred and fifty feet in length.\r\n\r\nThis Cheops, the Egyptians said, reigned fifty years; and after he was\r\ndead his brother Chephren succeeded to the kingdom. This king followed\r\nthe same manner of dealing as the other, both in all the rest and also\r\nin that he made a pyramid, not indeed attaining to the measurements\r\nof that which was built by the former (this I know, having myself also\r\nmeasured it), and moreover there are no underground chambers beneath nor\r\ndoes a channel come from the Nile flowing to this one as to the other,\r\nin which the water coming through a conduit built for it flows round\r\nan island within, where they say that Cheops himself is laid: but for a\r\nbasement he built the first course of Ethiopian stone of divers colours;\r\nand this pyramid he made forty feet lower than the other as regards\r\nsize, building it close to the great pyramid. These stand both upon the\r\nsame hill, which is about a hundred feet high. And Chephren they said\r\nreigned fifty and six years. Here then they reckon one hundred and six\r\nyears, during which they say that there was nothing but evil for the\r\nEgyptians, and the temples were kept closed and not opened during all\r\nthat time. These kings the Egyptians by reason of their hatred of them\r\nare not very willing to name; nay, they even call the pyramids after the\r\nname of Philitis the shepherd, who at that time pastured flocks in those\r\nregions. After him, they said, Mykerinos became king over Egypt, who was\r\nthe son of Cheops; and to him his father's deeds were displeasing, and\r\nhe both opened the temples and gave liberty to the people, who were\r\nground down to the last extremity of evil, to return to their own\r\nbusiness and to their sacrifices: also he gave decisions of their causes\r\njuster than those of all the other kings besides. In regard to this then\r\nthey commend this king more than all the other kings who had arisen in\r\nEgypt before him; for he not only gave good decisions, but also when\r\na man complained of the decision, he gave him recompense from his own\r\ngoods and thus satisfied his desire. But while Mykerinos was acting\r\nmercifully to his subjects and practising this conduct which has been\r\nsaid, calamities befell him, of which the first was this, namely that\r\nhis daughter died, the only child whom he had in his house: and being\r\nabove measure grieved by that which had befallen him, and desiring to\r\nbury his daughter in a manner more remarkable than others, he made a cow\r\nof wood, which he covered over with gold, and then within it he buried\r\nthis daughter who as I said, had died. This cow was not covered up in\r\nthe ground, but it might be seen even down to my own time in the city\r\nof Sais, placed within the royal palace in a chamber which was greatly\r\nadorned; and they offer incense of all kinds before it every day, and\r\neach night a lamp burns beside it all through the night. Near this cow\r\nin another chamber stand images of the concubines of Mykerinos, as the\r\npriests at Sais told me; for there are in fact colossal wooden statues,\r\nin number about twenty, made with naked bodies; but who they are I am\r\nnot able to say, except only that which is reported. Some however tell\r\nabout this cow and the colossal statues the following tale, namely that\r\nMykerinos was enamoured of his own daughter and afterwards ravished her;\r\nand upon this they say that the girl strangled herself for grief, and\r\nhe buried her in this cow; and her mother cut off the hands of the maids\r\nwho had betrayed the daughter to her father; wherefore now the images of\r\nthem have suffered that which the maids suffered in their life. In thus\r\nsaying they speak idly, as it seems to me, especially in what they say\r\nabout the hands of the statues; for as to this, even we ourselves saw\r\nthat their hands had dropped off from lapse of time, and they were to be\r\nseen still lying at their feet even down to my time. The cow is covered\r\nup with a crimson robe, except only the head and the neck, which are\r\nseen, overlaid with gold very thickly; and between the horns there is\r\nthe disc of the sun figured in gold. The cow is not standing up but\r\nkneeling, and in size is equal to a large living cow. Every year it is\r\ncarried forth from the chamber, at those times, I say, the Egyptians\r\nbeat themselves for that god whom I will not name upon occasion of such\r\na matter; at these times, I say, they also carry forth the cow to the\r\nlight of day, for they say that she asked of her father Mykerinos, when\r\nshe was dying, that she might look upon the sun once in the year.\r\n\r\nAfter the misfortune of his daughter it happened, they said, secondly\r\nto this king as follows:--An oracle came to him from the city of Buto,\r\nsaying that he was destined to live but six years more, in the seventh\r\nyear to end his life: and he being indignant at it sent to the Oracle\r\na reproach against the god, making complaint in reply that whereas\r\nhis father and uncle, who had shut up the temples and had not only not\r\nremembered the gods, but also had been destroyers of men, had lived for\r\na long time, he himself, who practised piety, was destined to end his\r\nlife so soon: and from the Oracle came a second message, which said\r\nthat it was for this very cause that he was bringing his life to a swift\r\nclose; for he had not done that which it was appointed for him to do,\r\nsince it was destined that Egypt should suffer evils for a hundred and\r\nfifty years, and the two kings who had arisen before him had perceived\r\nthis, but he had not. Mykerinos having heard this, and considering that\r\nthis sentence had passed upon him beyond recall, procured many lamps,\r\nand whenever night came on he lighted these and began to drink and take\r\nhis pleasure, ceasing neither by day nor by night; and he went about to\r\nthe fen-country and to the woods and wherever he heard there were the\r\nmost suitable places of enjoyment. This he devised (having a mind to\r\nprove that the Oracle spoke falsely) in order that he might have twelve\r\nyears of life instead of six, the nights being turned into days.\r\n\r\nThis king also left behind him a pyramid, much smaller than that of his\r\nfather, of a square shape and measuring on each side three hundred feet\r\nlacking twenty, built moreover of Ethiopian stone up to half the\r\nheight. This pyramid some of the Hellenes say was built by the courtesan\r\nRhodopis, not therein speaking rightly: and besides this it is evident\r\nto me that they who speak thus do not even know who Rhodopis was,\r\nfor otherwise they would not have attributed to her the building of a\r\npyramid like this, on which have been spent (so to speak) innumerable\r\nthousands of talents: moreover they do not know that Rhodopis flourished\r\nin the reign of Amasis, and not in this king's reign; for Rhodopis\r\nlived very many years later than the kings who left behind them these\r\npyramids. By descent she was of Thrace, and she was a slave of Iadmon\r\nthe son of Hephaistopolis a Samian, and a fellow-slave of Esop the\r\nmaker of fables; for he too was once the slave of Iadmon, as was\r\nproved especially by this fact, namely that when the people of Delphi\r\nrepeatedly made proclamation in accordance with an oracle, to find some\r\none who would take up the blood-money for the death of Esop, no one else\r\nappeared, but at length the grandson of Iadmon, called Iadmon also, took\r\nit up; and thus it is showed that Esop too was the slave of Iadmon.\r\nAs for Rhodopis, she came to Egypt brought by Xanthes the Samian,\r\nand having come thither to exercise her calling she was redeemed\r\nfrom slavery for a great sum by a man of Mytilene, Charaxos son of\r\nScamandronymos and brother of Sappho the lyric poet. Thus was Rhodopis\r\nset free, and she remained in Egypt and by her beauty won so much liking\r\nthat she made great gain of money for one like Rhodopis, though not\r\nenough to suffice for the cost of such a pyramid as this. In truth there\r\nis no need to ascribe to her very great riches, considering that the\r\ntithe of her wealth may still be seen even to this time by any one\r\nwho desires it: for Rhodopis wished to leave behind her a memorial of\r\nherself in Hellas, namely to cause a thing to be made such as happens\r\nnot to have been thought of or dedicated in a temple by any besides, and\r\nto dedicate this at Delphi as a memorial of herself. Accordingly with\r\nthe tithe of her wealth she caused to be made spits of iron of size\r\nlarge enough to pierce a whole ox, and many in number, going as far\r\ntherein as her tithe allowed her, and she sent them to Delphi: these\r\nare even at the present time lying there, heaped all together behind the\r\naltar which the Chians dedicated, and just opposite to the cell of the\r\ntemple. Now at Naucratis, as it happens, the courtesans are rather apt\r\nto win credit; for this woman first, about whom the story to which I\r\nrefer is told, became so famous that all the Hellenes without exception\r\ncame to know the name of Rhodopis, and then after her one whose name was\r\nArchidiche became a subject of song all over Hellas, though she was less\r\ntalked of than the other. As for Charaxos, when after redeeming Rhodopis\r\nhe returned back to Mytilene, Sappho in an ode violently abused him. Of\r\nRhodopis then I shall say no more.\r\n\r\nAfter Mykerinos the priests said Asychis became king of Egypt, and he\r\nmade for Hephaistos the temple gateway which is towards the sunrising,\r\nby far the most beautiful and the largest of the gateways; for while\r\nthey all have figures carved upon them and innumerable ornaments of\r\nbuilding besides, this has them very much more than the rest. In this\r\nking's reign they told me that, as the circulation of money was very\r\nslow, a law was made for the Egyptians that a man might have that money\r\nlent to him which he needed, by offering as security the dead body of\r\nhis father; and there was added moreover to this law another, namely\r\nthat he who lent the money should have a claim also to the whole of the\r\nsepulchral chamber belonging to him who received it, and that the man\r\nwho offered that security should be subject to this penalty, if he\r\nrefused to pay back the debt, namely that neither the man himself\r\nshould be allowed to have burial, when he died, either in that family\r\nburial-place or in any other, nor should he be allowed to bury any of\r\nhis kinsmen whom he lost by death. This king desiring to surpass the\r\nkings of Egypt who had arisen before him left as a memorial of himself a\r\npyramid which he made of bricks and on it there is an inscription\r\ncarved in stone and saying thus: \"Despise not me in comparison with the\r\npyramids of stone, seeing that I excel them as much as Zeus excels the\r\nother gods; for with a pole they struck into the lake, and whatever\r\nof the mud attached itself to the pole, this they gathered up and made\r\nbricks, and in such manner they finished me.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the deeds which this king performed: and after him reigned a\r\nblind man of the city of Anysis, whose name was Anysis. In his reign\r\nthe Ethiopians and Sabacos the king of the Ethiopians marched upon Egypt\r\nwith a great host of men; so this blind man departed, flying to the\r\nfen-country, and the Ethiopian was king over Egypt for fifty years,\r\nduring which he performed deeds as follows:--whenever any man of the\r\nEgyptians committed any transgression, he would never put him to death,\r\nbut he gave sentence upon each man according to the greatness of the\r\nwrong-doing, appointing them to work at throwing up an embankment before\r\nthat city from whence each man came of those who committed wrong. Thus\r\nthe cities were made higher still than before; for they were embanked\r\nfirst by those who dug the channels in the reign of Sesostris, and then\r\nsecondly in the reign of the Ethiopian, and thus they were made very\r\nhigh: and while other cities in Egypt also stood high, I think in the\r\ntown at Bubastis especially the earth was piled up. In this city there\r\nis a temple very well worthy of mention, for though there are other\r\ntemples which are larger and build with more cost, none more than\r\nthis is a pleasure to the eyes. Now Bubastis in the Hellenic tongue\r\nis Artemis, and her temple is ordered thus:--Except the entrance it is\r\ncompletely surrounded by water; for channels come in from the Nile, not\r\njoining one another, but each extending as far as the entrance of the\r\ntemple, one flowing round on the one side and the other on the other\r\nside, each a hundred feet broad and shaded over with trees; and the\r\ngateway has a height of ten fathoms, and it is adorned with figures six\r\ncubits high, very noteworthy. This temple is in the middle of the city\r\nand is looked down upon from all sides as one goes round, for since the\r\ncity has been banked up to a height, while the temple has not been moved\r\nfrom the place where it was at the first built, it is possible to look\r\ndown into it: and round it runs a stone wall with figures carved upon\r\nit, while within it there is a grove of very large trees planted round\r\na large temple-house, within which is the image of the goddess: and the\r\nbreadth and length of the temple is a furlong every way. Opposite the\r\nentrance there is a road paved with stone for about three furlongs,\r\nwhich leads through the market-place towards the East, with a breadth\r\nof about four hundred feet; and on this side and on that grow trees of\r\nheight reaching to heaven: and the road leads to the temple of Hermes.\r\nThis temple then is thus ordered.\r\n\r\nThe final deliverance from the Ethiopian came about (they said) as\r\nfollows:--he fled away because he had seen in his sleep a vision, in\r\nwhich it seemed to him that a man came and stood by him and counselled\r\nhim to gather together all the priests in Egypt and cut them asunder in\r\nthe midst. Having seen this dream, he said that it seemed to him that\r\nthe gods were foreshowing him this to furnish an occasion against him,\r\nin order that he might do an impious deed with respect to religion,\r\nand so receive some evil either from the gods or from men: he would not\r\nhowever do so, but in truth (he said) the time had expired, during\r\nwhich it had been prophesied to him that he should rule Egypt before\r\nhe departed thence. For when he was in Ethiopia the Oracles which the\r\nEthiopians consult had told him that it was fated for him to rule Egypt\r\nfifty years: since then this time was now expiring, and the vision of\r\nthe dream also disturbed him, Sabacos departed out of Egypt of his own\r\nfree will.\r\n\r\nThen when the Ethiopian had gone away out of Egypt, the blind man came\r\nback from the fen-country and began to rule again, having lived there\r\nduring fifty years upon an island which he had made by heaping up ashes\r\nand earth: for whenever any of the Egyptians visited him bringing food,\r\naccording as it had been appointed to them severally to do without the\r\nknowledge of the Ethiopian, he bade them bring also some ashes for their\r\ngift. This island none was able to find before Amyrtaios; that is, for\r\nmore than seven hundred years the kings who arose before Amyrtaios were\r\nnot able to find it. Now the name of this island is Elbo, and its size\r\nis ten furlongs each way.\r\n\r\nAfter him there came to the throne the priest of Hephaistos, whose name\r\nwas Sethos. This man, they said, neglected and held in no regard the\r\nwarrior class of the Egyptians, considering that he would have no need\r\nof them; and besides other slights which he put upon them, he also\r\ntook from them the yokes of corn-land which had been given to them as\r\na special gift in the reigns of the former kings, twelve yokes to each\r\nman. After this, Sanacharib king of the Arabians and of the Assyrians\r\nmarched a great host against Egypt. Then the warriors of the Egyptians\r\nrefused to come to the rescue, and the priest, being driven into a\r\nstrait, entered into the sanctuary of the temple and bewailed to the\r\nimage of the god the danger which was impending over him; and as he was\r\nthus lamenting, sleep came upon him, and it seemed to him in his vision\r\nthat the god came and stood by him and encouraged him, saying that he\r\nshould suffer no evil if he went forth to meet the army of the Arabians;\r\nfor he would himself send him helpers. Trusting in these things seen\r\nin sleep, he took with him, they said, those of the Egyptians who were\r\nwilling to follow him, and encamped in Pelusion, for by this way the\r\ninvasion came: and not one of the warrior class followed him, but\r\nshop-keepers and artisans and men of the market. Then after they came,\r\nthere swarmed by night upon their enemies mice of the fields, and ate up\r\ntheir quivers and their bows, and moreover the handles of their shields,\r\nso that on the next day they fled, and being without defence of arms\r\ngreat numbers fell. And at the present time this king stands in the\r\ntemple of Hephaistos in stone, holding upon his hand a mouse, and by\r\nletters inscribed he says these words: \"Let him who looks upon me learn\r\nto fear the gods.\"\r\n\r\nSo far in the story the Egyptians and the priests were they who made\r\nthe report, declaring that from the first king down to this priest of\r\nHephaistos who reigned last, there had been three hundred and forty-one\r\ngenerations of men, and that in them there had been the same number of\r\nchief-priests and of kings: but three hundred generations of men are\r\nequal to ten thousand years, for a hundred years is three generations\r\nof men; and in the one-and-forty generations which remain, those I mean\r\nwhich were added to the three hundred, there are one thousand three\r\nhundred and forty years. Thus in the period of eleven thousand three\r\nhundred and forty years they said that there had arisen no god in human\r\nform; nor even before that time or afterwards among the remaining kings\r\nwho arise in Egypt, did they report that anything of that kind had come\r\nto pass. In this time they said that the sun had moved four times from\r\nhis accustomed place of rising, and where he now sets he had thence\r\ntwice had his rising, and in the place from whence he now rises he had\r\ntwice had his setting; and in the meantime nothing in Egypt had been\r\nchanged from its usual state, neither that which comes from the earth\r\nnor that which comes to them from the river nor that which concerns\r\ndiseases or deaths. And formerly when Hecataios the historian was in\r\nThebes, and had traced his descent and connected his family with a god\r\nin the sixteenth generation before, the priests of Zeus did for him much\r\nthe same as they did for me (though I had not traced my descent). They\r\nled me into the sanctuary of the temple, which is of great size, and\r\nthey counted up the number, showing colossal wooden statues in number\r\nthe same as they said; for each chief-priest there sets up in his\r\nlifetime an image of himself: accordingly the priests, counting and\r\nshowing me these, declared to me that each one of them was a son\r\nsucceeding his own father, and they went up through the series of images\r\nfrom the image of the one who had died last, until they had declared\r\nthis of the whole number. And when Hecataios had traced his descent and\r\nconnected his family with a god in the sixteenth generation, they traced\r\na descent in opposition to his, besides their numbering, not accepting\r\nit from him that a man had been born from a god; and they traced their\r\ncounter-descent thus, saying that each one of the statues had been\r\n_piromis_ son of _piromis_, until they had declared this of the whole\r\nthree hundred and forty-five statues, each one being surnamed _piromis_;\r\nand neither with a god nor a hero did they connect their descent. Now\r\n_piromis_ means in the tongue of Hellas \"honourable and good man.\" From\r\ntheir declaration then it followed, that they of whom the images were\r\nhad been of form like this, and far removed from being gods: but in the\r\ntime before these men they said that gods were the rulers in Egypt, not\r\nmingling with men, and that of these always one had power at a time;\r\nand the last of them who was king over Egypt was Oros the son of Osiris,\r\nwhom the Hellenes call Apollo: he was king over Egypt last, having\r\ndeposed Typhon. Now Osiris in the tongue of Hellas is Dionysos.\r\n\r\nAmong the Hellenes Heracles and Dionysos and Pan are accounted the\r\nlastest-born of the gods; but with the Egyptians Pan is a very ancient\r\ngod, and he is one of those which are called eight gods, while Heracles\r\nis of the second rank, who are called the twelve gods, and Dionysos is\r\nof the third rank, namely of those who were born of the twelve gods. Now\r\nas to Heracles I have shown already how many years old he is according\r\nto the Egyptians themselves, reckoning down to the reign of Amasis, and\r\nPan is said to have existed for yet more years than these, and Dionysos\r\nfor the smallest number of years as compared with the others; and even\r\nfor this last they reckon down to the reign of Amasis fifteen thousand\r\nyears. This the Egyptians say that they know for a certainty, since they\r\nalways kept a reckoning and wrote down the years as they came. Now the\r\nDionysos who is said to have been born of Semele the daughter of Cadmos,\r\nwas born about sixteen hundred years before my time, and Heracles who\r\nwas the son of Alcmene, about nine hundred years, and that Pan who was\r\nborn of Penelope, for of her and of Hermes Pan is said by the Hellenes\r\nto have been born, came into being later than the wars of Troy, about\r\neight hundred years before my time. Of these two accounts every man may\r\nadopt that one which he shall find the more credible when he hears it.\r\nI however, for my part, have already declared my opinion about them. For\r\nif these also, like Heracles the son of Amphitryon, had appeared before\r\nall men's eyes and had lived their lives to old age in Hellas, I mean\r\nDionysos the son of Semele and Pan the son of Penelope, then one would\r\nhave said that these also had been born mere men, having the names\r\nof those gods who had come into being long before: but as it is, with\r\nregard to Dionysos the Hellenes say that as soon as he was born Zeus\r\nsewed him up in his thigh and carried him to Nysa, which is above Egypt\r\nin the land of Ethiopia; and as to Pan, they cannot say whither he went\r\nafter he was born. Hence it has become clear to me that the Hellenes\r\nlearnt the names of these gods later than those of the other gods, and\r\ntrace their descent as if their birth occurred at the time when they\r\nfirst learnt their names.\r\n\r\nThus far then the history is told by the Egyptians themselves; but I\r\nwill now recount that which other nations also tell, and the Egyptians\r\nin agreement with the others, of that which happened in this land: and\r\nthere will be added to this also something of that which I have myself\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nBeing set free after the reign of the priest of Hephaistos, the\r\nEgyptians, since they could not live any time without a king, set up\r\nover them twelve kings, having divided all Egypt into twelve parts.\r\nThese made intermarriages with one another and reigned, making agreement\r\nthat they would not put down one another by force, nor seek to get an\r\nadvantage over one another, but would live in perfect friendship: and\r\nthe reason why they made these agreements, guarding them very strongly\r\nfrom violation, was this, namely that an oracle had been given to them\r\nat first when they began to exercise their rule, that he of them who\r\nshould pour a libation with a bronze cup in the temple of Hephaistos,\r\nshould be king of all Egypt (for they used to assemble together in all\r\nthe temples). Moreover they resolved to join all together and leave a\r\nmemorial of themselves; and having so resolved they caused to be made\r\na labyrinth, situated a little above the lake of Moiris and nearly\r\nopposite to that which is called the City of Crocodiles. This I saw\r\nmyself, and I found it greater than words can say. For if one should\r\nput together and reckon up all the buildings and all the great works\r\nproduced by Hellenes, they would prove to be inferior in labour and\r\nexpense to this labyrinth, though it is true that both the temple at\r\nEphesos and that at Samos are works worthy of note. The pyramids also\r\nwere greater than words can say, and each one of them is equal to many\r\nworks of the Hellenes, great as they may be; but the labyrinth surpasses\r\neven the pyramids. It has twelve courts covered in, with gates facing\r\none another, six upon the North side and six upon the South, joining on\r\none to another, and the same wall surrounds them all outside; and there\r\nare in it two kinds of chambers, the one kind below the ground and the\r\nother above upon these, three thousand in number, of each kind fifteen\r\nhundred. The upper set of chambers we ourselves saw, going through them,\r\nand we tell of them having looked upon them with our own eyes; but the\r\nchambers under ground we heard about only; for the Egyptians who had\r\ncharge of them were not willing on any account to show them, saying that\r\nhere were the sepulchres of the kings who had first built this labyrinth\r\nand of the sacred crocodiles. Accordingly we speak of the chambers below\r\nby what we received from hearsay, while those above we saw ourselves and\r\nfound them to be works of more than human greatness. For the passages\r\nthrough the chambers, and the goings this way and that way through\r\nthe courts, which were admirably adorned, afforded endless matter for\r\nmarvel, as we went through from a court to the chambers beyond it, and\r\nfrom the chambers to colonnades, and from the colonnades to other rooms,\r\nand then from the chambers again to other courts. Over the whole of\r\nthese is a roof made of stone like the walls; and the walls are covered\r\nwith figures carved upon them, each court being surrounded with pillars\r\nof white stone fitted together most perfectly; and at the end of the\r\nlabyrinth, by the corner of it, there is a pyramid of forty fathoms,\r\nupon which large figures are carved, and to this there is a way made\r\nunder ground.\r\n\r\nSuch is this labyrinth: but a cause for marvel even greater than this is\r\nafforded by the lake, which is called the lake of Moiris, along the side\r\nof which this labyrinth is built. The measure of its circuit is three\r\nthousand six hundred furlongs (being sixty _schoines_), and this is the\r\nsame number of furlongs as the extent of Egypt itself along the sea. The\r\nlake lies extended lengthwise from North to South, and in depth where it\r\nis deepest it is fifty fathoms. That this lake is artificial and formed\r\nby digging is self-evident, for about in the middle of the lake stand\r\ntwo pyramids, each rising above the water to a height of fifty fathoms,\r\nthe part which is built below the water being of just the same height;\r\nand upon each is placed a colossal statue of stone sitting upon a chair.\r\nThus the pyramids are a hundred fathoms high; and these hundred fathoms\r\nare equal to a furlong of six hundred feet, the fathom being measured as\r\nsix feet or four cubits, the feet being four palms each, and the cubits\r\nsix. The water in the lake does not come from the place where it is, for\r\nthe country there is very deficient in water, but it has been brought\r\nthither from the Nile by a canal; and for six months the water flows\r\ninto the lake, and for six months out into the Nile again; and whenever\r\nit flows out, then for the six months it brings into the royal treasury\r\na talent of silver a day from the fish which are caught, and twenty\r\npounds when the water comes in. The natives of the place moreover said\r\nthat this lake had an outlet under ground to the Syrtis which is in\r\nLibya, turning towards the interior of the continent upon the Western\r\nside and running along by the mountain which is above Memphis. Now since\r\nI did not see anywhere existing the earth dug out of this excavation\r\n(for that was a matter which drew my attention), I asked those who dwelt\r\nnearest to the lake where the earth was which had been dug out. These\r\ntold me to what place it had been carried away; and I readily believed\r\nthem, for I knew by report that a similar thing had been done at\r\nNineveh, the city of the Assyrians. There certain thieves formed a\r\ndesign once to carry away the wealth of Sardanapallos son of Ninos, the\r\nking, which wealth was very great and was kept in treasure-houses under\r\nthe earth. Accordingly they began from their own dwelling, and making\r\nestimate of their direction they dug under ground towards the king's\r\npalace; and the earth which was brought out of the excavation they used\r\nto carry away, when night came on, to the river Tigris which flows by\r\nthe city of Nineveh, until at last they accomplished that which they\r\ndesired. Similarly, as I heard, the digging of the lake in Egypt was\r\neffected, except that it was done not by night but during the day; for\r\nas they dug the Egyptians carried to the Nile the earth which was dug\r\nout; and the river, when it received it, would naturally bear it away\r\nand disperse it. Thus is this lake said to have been dug out.\r\n\r\nNow the twelve kings continued to rule justly, but in course of time it\r\nhappened thus:--After sacrifice in the temple of Hephaistos they\r\nwere about to make libation on the last day of the feast, and the\r\nchief-priest, in bringing out for them the golden cups with which they\r\nhad been wont to pour libations, missed his reckoning and brought eleven\r\nonly for the twelve kings. Then that one of them who was standing last\r\nin order, namely Psammetichos, since he had no cup took off from his\r\nhead his helmet, which was of bronze, and having held it out to receive\r\nthe wine he proceeded to make libation: likewise all the other kings\r\nwere wont to wear helmets and they happened to have them then. Now\r\nPsammetichos held out his helmet with no treacherous meaning; but they\r\ntaking note of that which had been done by Psammetichos and of the\r\noracle, namely how it had been declared to them that whosoever of them\r\nshould make libation with a bronze cup should be sole king of Egypt,\r\nrecollecting, I say, the saying of the Oracle, they did not indeed deem\r\nit right to slay Psammetichos, since they found by examination that he\r\nhad not done it with any forethought, but they determined to strip him\r\nof almost all his power and to drive him away into the fen-country, and\r\nthat from the fen-country he should not hold any dealings with the\r\nrest of Egypt. This Psammetichos had formerly been a fugitive from the\r\nEthiopian Sabacos who had killed his father Necos, from him, I say, he\r\nhad then been a fugitive in Syria; and when the Ethiopian had departed\r\nin consequence of the vision of the dream, the Egyptians who were of the\r\ndistrict of Sais brought him back to his own country. Then afterwards,\r\nwhen he was king, it was his fate to be a fugitive a second time\r\non account of the helmet, being driven by the eleven kings into the\r\nfen-country. So then holding that he had been grievously wronged by\r\nthem, he thought how he might take vengeance on those who had driven\r\nhim out: and when he had sent to the Oracle of Leto in the city of Buto,\r\nwhere the Egyptians have their most truthful Oracle, there was given to\r\nhim the reply that vengeance would come when men of bronze appeared from\r\nthe sea. And he was strongly disposed not to believe that bronze men\r\nwould come to help him; but after no long time had passed, certain\r\nIonians and Carians who had sailed forth for plunder were compelled to\r\ncome to shore in Egypt, and they having landed and being clad in bronze\r\narmour, came to the fen-land and brought a report to Psammetichos that\r\nbronze men had come from the sea and were plundering the plain. So he,\r\nperceiving that the saying of the Oracle was coming to pass, dealt in a\r\nfriendly manner with the Ionians and Carians, and with large promises he\r\npersuaded them to take his part. Then when he had persuaded them, with\r\nthe help of those Egyptians who favoured his cause and of these foreign\r\nmercenaries he overthrew the kings. Having thus got power over all\r\nEgypt, Psammetichos made for Hephaistos that gateway of the temple at\r\nMemphis which is turned towards the South Wind; and he built a court for\r\nApis, in which Apis is kept when he appears, opposite to the gateway of\r\nthe temple, surrounded all with pillars and covered with figures; and\r\ninstead of columns there stand to support the roof of the court colossal\r\nstatues twelve cubits high. Now Apis is in the tongue of the Hellenes\r\nEpaphos. To the Ionians and to the Carians who had helped him\r\nPsammetichos granted portions of land to dwell in, opposite to\r\none another with the river Nile between, and these were called\r\n\"Encampments\"; these portions of land he gave them, and he paid them\r\nbesides all that he had promised: moreover he placed with them Egyptian\r\nboys to have them taught the Hellenic tongue; and from these, who learnt\r\nthe language thoroughly, are descended the present class of interpreters\r\nin Egypt. Now the Ionians and Carians occupied these portions of land\r\nfor a long time, and they are towards the sea a little below the city of\r\nBubastis, on that which is called the Pelusian mouth of the Nile. These\r\nmen king Amasis afterwards removed from thence and established them at\r\nMemphis, making them into a guard for himself against the Egyptians:\r\nand they being settled in Egypt, we who are Hellenes know by intercourse\r\nwith them the certainty of all that which happened in Egypt beginning\r\nfrom king Psammetichos and afterwards; for these were the first men of\r\nforeign tongue who settled in Egypt: and in the land from which they\r\nwere removed there still remained down to my time the sheds where their\r\nships were drawn up and the ruins of their houses.\r\n\r\nThus then Psammetichos obtained Egypt: and of the Oracle which is in\r\nEgypt I have made mention often before this, and now I give an account\r\nof it, seeing that it is worthy to be described. This Oracle which is in\r\nEgypt is sacred to Leto, and it is established in a great city near that\r\nmouth of the Nile which is called Sebennytic, as one sails up the river\r\nfrom the sea; and the name of this city where the Oracle is found is\r\nButo, as I have said before in mentioning it. In this Buto there is a\r\ntemple of Apollo and Artemis; and the temple-house of Leto, in which the\r\nOracle is, is both great in itself and has a gateway of the height of\r\nten fathoms: but that which caused me most to marvel of the things to be\r\nseen there, I will now tell. There is in this sacred enclosure a house\r\nof Leto made of one single stone upon the top, the cornice measuring\r\nfour cubits. This house then of all the things that were to be seen by\r\nme in that temple is the most marvellous, and among those which come\r\nnext is the island called Chemmis. This is situated in a deep and broad\r\nlake by the side of the temple at Buto, and it is said by the Egyptians\r\nthat this island is a floating island. I myself did not see it either\r\nfloating about or moved from its place, and I feel surprise at hearing\r\nof it, wondering if it be indeed a floating island. In this island of\r\nwhich I speak there is a great temple-house of Apollo, and three several\r\naltars are set up within, and there are planted in the island many\r\npalm-trees and other trees, both bearing fruit and not bearing fruit.\r\nAnd the Egyptians, when they say that it is floating, add this story,\r\nnamely that in this island which formerly was not floating, Leto, being\r\none of the eight gods who came into existence first, and dwelling in the\r\ncity of Buto where she has this Oracle, received Apollo from Isis as a\r\ncharge and preserved him, concealing him in the island which is said now\r\nto be a floating island, at that time when Typhon came after him seeking\r\neverywhere and desiring to find the son of Osiris. Now they say that\r\nApollo and Artemis are children of Dionysos and of Isis, and that Leto\r\nbecame their nurse and preserver; and in the Egyptian tongue Apollo is\r\nOros, Demeter is Isis, and Artemis is Bubastis. From this story and from\r\nno other AEschylus the son of Euphorion took this which I shall say,\r\nwherein he differs from all the preceding poets; he represented namely\r\nthat Artemis was the daughter of Demeter. For this reason then, they\r\nsay, it became a floating island.\r\n\r\nSuch is the story which they tell; but as for Psammetichos, he was king\r\nover Egypt for four-and-fifty years, of which for thirty years save one\r\nhe was sitting before Azotos, a great city of Syria, besieging it, until\r\nat last he took it: and this Azotos of all cities about which we have\r\nknowledge held out for the longest time under a siege.\r\n\r\nThe son of Psammetichos was Necos, and he became king of Egypt. This man\r\nwas the first who attempted the channel leading to the Erythraian Sea,\r\nwhich Dareios the Persian afterwards completed: the length of this is\r\na voyage of four days, and in breadth it was so dug that two triremes\r\ncould go side by side driven by oars; and the water is brought into\r\nit from the Nile. The channel is conducted a little above the city of\r\nBubastis by Patumos the Arabian city, and runs into the Erythraian Sea:\r\nand it is dug first along those parts of the plain of Egypt which lie\r\ntowards Arabia, just above which run the mountains which extend\r\nopposite Memphis, where are the stone-quarries,--along the base of these\r\nmountains the channel is conducted from West to East for a great way;\r\nand after that it is directed towards a break in the hills and tends\r\nfrom these mountains towards the noon-day and the South Wind to the\r\nArabian gulf. Now in the place where the journey is least and shortest\r\nfrom the Northern to the Southern Sea (which is also called Erythraian),\r\nthat is from Mount Casion, which is the boundary between Egypt and\r\nSyria, the distance is exactly a thousand furlongs to the Arabian gulf;\r\nbut the channel is much longer, since it is more winding; and in the\r\nreign of Necos there perished while digging it twelve myriads of the\r\nEgyptians. Now Necos ceased in the midst of his digging, because the\r\nutterance of an Oracle impeded him, which was to the effect that he was\r\nworking for the Barbarian: and the Egyptians call all men Barbarians who\r\ndo not agree with them in speech. Thus having ceased from the work of\r\nthe channel, Necos betook himself to raging wars, and triremes were\r\nbuilt by him, some for the Northern Sea and others in the Arabian gulf\r\nfor the Erythraian Sea; and of these the sheds are still to be seen.\r\nThese ships he used when he needed them; and also on land Necos engaged\r\nbattle at Magdolos with the Syrians, and conquered them; and after this\r\nhe took Cadytis, which is a great city of Syria: and the dress which he\r\nwore when he made these conquests he dedicated to Apollo, sending it to\r\nBranchidai of the Milesians. After this, having reigned in all sixteen\r\nyears, he brought his life to an end, and handed on the kingdom to\r\nPsammis his son.\r\n\r\nWhile this Psammis was king of Egypt, there came to him men sent by the\r\nEleians, who boasted that they ordered the contest at Olympia in the\r\nmost just and honourable manner possible and thought that not even the\r\nEgyptians, the wisest of men, could find out anything besides, to be\r\nadded to their rules. Now when the Eleians came to Egypt and said that\r\nfor which they had come, then this king called together those of the\r\nEgyptians who were reputed the wisest, and when the Egyptians had come\r\ntogether they heard the Eleians tell of all that which it was their part\r\nto do in regard to the contest; and when they had related everything,\r\nthey said that they had come to learn in addition anything which the\r\nEgyptians might be able to find out besides, which was juster than this.\r\nThey then having consulted together asked the Eleians whether their own\r\ncitizens took part in the contest; and they said that it was permitted\r\nto any one who desired it, to take part in the contest: upon which the\r\nEgyptians said that in so ordering the games they had wholly missed the\r\nmark of justice; for it could not be but that they would take part with\r\nthe man of their own State, if he was contending, and so act unfairly\r\nto the stranger: but if they really desired, as they said, to order\r\nthe games justly, and if this was the cause for which they had come to\r\nEgypt, they advised them to order the contest so as to be for strangers\r\nalone to contend in, and that no Eleian should be permitted to contend.\r\nSuch was the suggestion made by the Egyptians to the Eleians.\r\n\r\nWhen Psammis had been king of Egypt for only six years and had made an\r\nexpedition to Ethiopia and immediately afterwards had ended his life,\r\nApries the son of Psammis received the kingdom in succession. This man\r\ncame to be the most prosperous of all the kings up to that time except\r\nonly his forefather Psammetichos; and he reigned five-and-twenty years,\r\nduring which he led an army against Sidon and fought a sea-fight with\r\nthe king of Tyre. Since however it was fated that evil should come upon\r\nhim it came by occasion of a matter which I shall relate at greater\r\nlength in the Libyan history, and at present but shortly. Apries having\r\nsent a great expedition against the Kyrenians, met with correspondingly\r\ngreat disaster; and the Egyptians considering him to blame for this\r\nrevolted from him, supposing that Apries had with forethought sent them\r\nout to evident calamity, in order (as they said) that there might be a\r\nslaughter of them, and he might the more securely rule over the other\r\nEgyptians. Being indignant at this, both these men who had returned\r\nfrom the expedition and also the friends of those who had perished made\r\nrevolt openly. Hearing this Apries sent to them Amasis, to cause them\r\nto cease by persuasion; and when he had come and was seeking to restrain\r\nthe Egyptians, as he was speaking and telling them not to do so, one of\r\nthe Egyptians stood up behind him and put a helmet upon his head, saying\r\nas he did so that he put it on to crown him king. And to him this\r\nthat was done was in some degree not unwelcome, as he proved by his\r\nbehaviour; for as soon as the revolted Egyptians had set him up as king,\r\nhe prepared to march against Apries: and Apries hearing this sent to\r\nAmasis one of the Egyptians who were about his own person, a man of\r\nreputation, whose name was Patarbemis, enjoining him to bring Amasis\r\nalive into his presence. When this Patarbemis came and summoned Amasis,\r\nthe latter, who happened to be sitting on horseback, lifted up his leg\r\nand behaved in an unseemly manner, bidding him take that back to Apries.\r\nNevertheless, they say, Patarbemis made demand of him that he should\r\ngo to the king, seeing that the king had sent to summon him; and he\r\nanswered him that he had for some time past been preparing to do so, and\r\nthat Apries would have no occasion to find fault with him, for he\r\nwould both come himself and bring others with him. Then Patarbemis both\r\nperceiving his intention from that which he said, and also seeing his\r\npreparations, departed in haste, desiring to make known as quickly as\r\npossible to the king the things which were being done: and when he came\r\nback to Apries not bringing Amasis, the king paying no regard to that\r\nwhich he said, but being moved by violent anger, ordered his ears and\r\nhis nose to be cut off. And the rest of the Egyptians who still remained\r\non his side, when they saw the man of most repute among them thus\r\nsuffering shameful outrage, waited no longer but joined the others in\r\nrevolt, and delivered themselves over to Amasis. Then Apries having\r\nheard this also, armed his foreign mercenaries and marched against the\r\nEgyptians: now he had about him Carian and Ionian mercenaries to the\r\nnumber of thirty thousand; and his royal palace was in the city of Sais,\r\nof great size and worthy to be seen. So Apries and his army were going\r\nagainst the Egyptians, and Amasis and those with him were going against\r\nthe mercenaries; and both sides came to the city of Momemphis and were\r\nabout to make trial of one another in fight.\r\n\r\nNow of the Egyptians there are seven classes, and of these one class is\r\ncalled that of the priests, and another that of the warriors, while\r\nthe others are the cowherds, swineherds, shopkeepers, interpreters, and\r\nboatmen. This is the number of the classes of the Egyptians, and their\r\nnames are given them from the occupations which they follow. Of them the\r\nwarriors are called Calasirians and Hermotybians, and they are of the\r\nfollowing districts,--for all Egypt is divided into districts. The\r\ndistricts of the Hermotybians are those of Busiris, Sais, Chemmis,\r\nPapremis, the island called Prosopitis, and the half of Natho,--of\r\nthese districts are the Hermotybians, who reached when most numerous the\r\nnumber of sixteen myriads. Of these not one has been learnt anything of\r\nhandicraft, but they are given up to war entirely. Again the districts\r\nof the Calasirians are those of Thebes, Bubastis, Aphthis, Tanis,\r\nMendes, Sebennytos, Athribis, Pharbaithos, Thmuis, Onuphis, Anytis,\r\nMyecphoris,--this last is on an island opposite to the city of Bubastis.\r\nThese are the districts of the Calasirians; and they reached, when most\r\nnumerous, to the number of five-and-twenty myriads of men; nor is it\r\nlawful for these, any more than for the others, to practise any craft;\r\nbut they practise that which has to do with war only, handing down the\r\ntradition from father to son. Now whether the Hellenes have learnt this\r\nalso from the Egyptians, I am not able to say for certain, since I\r\nsee that the Thracians also and Scythians and Persians and Lydians and\r\nalmost all the Barbarians esteem those of their citizens who learn the\r\narts, and the descendants of them, as less honourable than the rest;\r\nwhile those who have got free from all practice of manual arts are\r\naccounted noble, and especially those who are devoted to war: however\r\nthat may be, the Hellenes have all learnt this, and especially the\r\nLacedemonians; but the Corinthians least of all cast slight upon those\r\nwho practise handicraft.\r\n\r\nThe following privilege was specially granted to this class and to none\r\nothers of the Egyptians except the priests, that is to say, each man had\r\ntwelve yokes of land specially granted to him free from imposts: now\r\nthe yoke of land measures a hundred Egyptian cubits every way, and the\r\nEgyptian cubit is, as it happens, equal to that of Samos. This, I\r\nsay, was a special privilege granted to all, and they also had certain\r\nadvantages in turn and not the same men twice; that is to say, a\r\nthousand of the Calasirians and a thousand of the Hermotybians acted\r\nas body-guard to the king during each year; and these had besides their\r\nyokes of land an allowance given them for each day of five pounds weight\r\nof bread to each man, and two pounds of beef, and four half-pints of\r\nwine. This was the allowance given to those who were serving as the\r\nking's body-guard for the time being.\r\n\r\nSo when Apries leading his foreign mercenaries, and Amasis at the head\r\nof the whole body of the Egyptians, in their approach to one another had\r\ncome to the city of Momemphis, they engaged in battle: and although the\r\nforeign troops fought well, yet being much inferior in number they were\r\nworsted by reason of this. But Apries is said to have supposed that not\r\neven a god would be able to cause him to cease from his rule, so firmly\r\ndid he think that it was established. In that battle then, I say, he was\r\nworsted, and being taken alive was brought away to the city of Sais, to\r\nthat which had formerly been his own dwelling but from thenceforth was\r\nthe palace of Amasis. There for some time he was kept in the palace, and\r\nAmasis dealt well with him but at last, since the Egyptians blamed\r\nhim, saying that he acted not rightly in keeping alive him who was\r\nthe greatest foe both to themselves and to him, therefore he delivered\r\nApries over to the Egyptians; and they strangled him, and after that\r\nburied him in the burial-place of his fathers: this is in the temple of\r\nAthene, close to the sanctuary, on the left hand as you enter. Now the\r\nmen of Sais buried all those of this district who had been kings, within\r\nthe temple; for the tomb of Amasis also, though it is further from\r\nthe sanctuary than that of Apries and his forefathers, yet this too is\r\nwithin the court of the temple, and it consists of a colonnade of stone\r\nof great size, with pillars carved to imitate date-palms, and otherwise\r\nsumptuously adorned; and within the colonnade are double doors, and\r\ninside the doors a sepulchral chamber. Also at Sais there is the\r\nburial-place of him whom I account it not pious to name in connexion\r\nwith such a matter, which is in the temple of Athene behind the house\r\nof the goddess, stretching along the whole wall of it; and in the sacred\r\nenclosure stand great obelisks of stone, and near them is a lake adorned\r\nwith an edging of stone and fairly made in a circle, being in size,\r\nas it seemed to me, equal to that which is called the \"Round Pool\" in\r\nDelos. On this lake they perform by night the show of his sufferings,\r\nand this the Egyptians call Mysteries. Of these things I know more fully\r\nin detail how they take place, but I shall leave this unspoken; and of\r\nthe mystic rites of Demeter, which the Hellenes call _thesmophoria_, of\r\nthese also, although I know, I shall leave unspoken all except so much\r\nas piety permits me to tell. The daughters of Danaos were they who\r\nbrought this rite out of Egypt and taught it to the women of the\r\nPelasgians; then afterwards when all the inhabitants of Peloponnese were\r\ndriven out by the Dorians, the rite was lost, and only those who were\r\nleft behind of the Peloponnesians and not driven out, that is to say the\r\nArcadians, preserved it.\r\n\r\nApries having thus been overthrown, Amasis became king, being of the\r\ndistrict of Sais, and the name of the city whence he was is Siuph. Now\r\nat the first the Egyptians despised Amasis and held him in no\r\ngreat regard, because he had been a man of the people and was of no\r\ndistinguished family; but afterwards Amasis won them over to himself by\r\nwisdom and not wilfulness. Among innumerable other things of price which\r\nhe had, there was a foot-basin of gold in which both Amasis himself and\r\nall his guests were wont always to wash their feet. This he broke up,\r\nand of it he caused to be made the image of a god, and set it up in the\r\ncity, where it was most convenient; and the Egyptians went continually\r\nto visit the image and did great reverence to it. Then Amasis, having\r\nlearnt that which was done by the men of the city, called together the\r\nEgyptians and made known to them the matter, saying that the image had\r\nbeen produced from the foot-basin, into which formerly the Egyptians\r\nused to vomit and make water, and in which they washed their feet,\r\nwhereas now they did to it great reverence; and just so, he continued,\r\nhad he himself now fared, as the foot-basin; for though formerly he\r\nwas a man of the people, yet now he was their king, and he bade them\r\naccordingly honour him and have regard for him. In such manner he won\r\nthe Egyptians to himself, so that they consented to be his subjects; and\r\nhis ordering of affairs was this:--In the early morning, and until the\r\ntime of the filling of the market he did with a good will the business\r\nwhich was brought before him; but after this he passed the time in\r\ndrinking and in jesting at his boon-companions, and was frivolous and\r\nplayful. And his friends being troubled at it admonished him in some\r\nsuch words as these: \"O king, thou dost not rightly govern thyself in\r\nthus letting thyself descend to behaviour so trifling; for thou oughtest\r\nrather to have been sitting throughout the day stately upon a stately\r\nthrone and administering thy business; and so the Egyptians would have\r\nbeen assured that they were ruled by a great man, and thou wouldest\r\nhave had a better report: but as it is, thou art acting by no means in a\r\nkingly fashion.\" And he answered them thus: \"They who have bows stretch\r\nthem at such time as they wish to use them, and when they have finished\r\nusing them they loose them again; for if they were stretched tight\r\nalways they would break, so that the men would not be able to use them\r\nwhen they needed them. So also is the state of man: if he should always\r\nbe in earnest and not relax himself for sport at the due time, he would\r\neither go mad or be struck with stupor before he was aware; and knowing\r\nthis well, I distribute a portion of the time to each of the two ways of\r\nliving.\" Thus he replied to his friends. It is said however that Amasis,\r\neven when he was in a private station, was a lover of drinking and of\r\njesting, and not at all seriously disposed; and whenever his means of\r\nlivelihood failed him through his drinking and luxurious living, he\r\nwould go about and steal; and they from whom he stole would charge him\r\nwith having their property, and when he denied it would bring him before\r\nthe judgment of an Oracle, whenever there was one in their place;\r\nand many times he was convicted by the Oracles and many times he was\r\nabsolved: and then when finally he became king he did as follows:--as\r\nmany of the gods as had absolved him and pronounced him not to be a\r\nthief, to their temples he paid no regard, nor gave anything for the\r\nfurther adornment of them, nor even visited them to offer sacrifice,\r\nconsidering them to be worth nothing and to possess lying Oracles; but\r\nas many as had convicted him of being a thief, to these he paid very\r\ngreat regard, considering them to be truly gods, and to present Oracles\r\nwhich did not lie. First in Sais he built and completed for Athene a\r\ntemple-gateway which is a great marvel, and he far surpassed herein all\r\nwho had done the like before, both in regard to height and greatness,\r\nso large are the stones and of such quality. Then secondly he dedicated\r\ngreat colossal statues and man-headed sphinxes very large, and for\r\nrestoration he caused to be brought from the stone-quarries which\r\nare opposite Memphis, others of very great size from the city of\r\nElephantine, distant a voyage of not less than twenty days from Sais:\r\nand of them all I marvel most at this, namely a monolith chamber which\r\nhe brought from the city of Elephantine; and they were three years\r\nengaged in bringing this, and two thousand men were appointed to convey\r\nit, who all were of the class of boatmen. Of this house the length\r\noutside is one-and-twenty cubits, the breadth is fourteen cubits, and\r\nthe height eight. These are the measures of the monolith house outside;\r\nbut the length inside is eighteen cubits and five-sixths of a cubit, the\r\nbreadth twelve cubits, and the height five cubits. This lies by the side\r\nof the entrance to the temple; for within the temple they did not draw\r\nit, because, as it is said, while the house was being drawn along, the\r\nchief artificer of it groaned aloud, seeing that much time had been\r\nspent and he was wearied by the work; and Amasis took it to heart as a\r\nwarning and did not allow them to draw it further onwards. Some say on\r\nthe other hand that a man was killed by it, of those who were heaving it\r\nwith levers, and that it was not drawn in for that reason. Amasis also\r\ndedicated in all the other temples which were of repute, works which are\r\nworth seeing for their size, and among them also at Memphis the colossal\r\nstatue which lies on its back in front of the temple of Hephaistos,\r\nwhose length is five-and-seventy feet; and on the same base made of the\r\nsame stone are set two colossal statues, each of twenty feet in length,\r\none on this side and the other on that side of the large statue. There\r\nis also another of stone of the same size in Sais, lying in the same\r\nmanner as that at Memphis. Moreover Amasis was he who built and finished\r\nfor Isis her temple at Memphis, which is of great size and very worthy\r\nto be seen.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Amasis it is said that Egypt became more prosperous than\r\nat any other time before, both in regard to that which comes to the land\r\nfrom the river and in regard to that which comes from the land to its\r\ninhabitants, and that at this time the inhabited towns in it numbered\r\nin all twenty thousand. It was Amasis too who established the law that\r\nevery year each one of the Egyptians should declare to the ruler of his\r\ndistrict, from what source he got his livelihood, and if any man did\r\nnot do this or did not make declaration of an honest way of living,\r\nhe should be punished with death. Now Solon the Athenian received from\r\nEgypt this law and had it enacted for the Athenians, and they have\r\ncontinued to observe it, since it is a law with which none can find\r\nfault.\r\n\r\nMoreover Amasis became a lover of the Hellenes; and besides other proofs\r\nof friendship which he gave to several among them, he also granted the\r\ncity of Naucratis for those of them who came to Egypt to dwell in; and\r\nto those who did not desire to stay, but who made voyages thither, he\r\ngranted portions of land to set up altars and make sacred enclosures for\r\ntheir gods. Their greatest enclosure and that one which has most name\r\nand is most frequented is called the Hellenion, and this was established\r\nby the following cities in common:--of the Ionians Chios, Teos,\r\nPhocaia, Clazomenai, of the Dorians Rhodes, Cnidos, Halicarnassos,\r\nPhaselis, and of the Aiolians Mytilene alone. To these belongs this\r\nenclosure and these are the cities which appoint superintendents of the\r\nport; and all other cities which claim a share in it, are making a claim\r\nwithout any right. Besides this the Eginetans established on their own\r\naccount a sacred enclosure dedicated to Zeus, the Samians one to Hera,\r\nand the Milesians one to Apollo. Now in old times Naucratis alone was an\r\nopen trading-place, and no other place in Egypt: and if any one came to\r\nany other of the Nile mouths, he was compelled to swear that he came not\r\nthither of his own free will, and when he had thus sworn his innocence\r\nhe had to sail with his ship to the Canobic mouth, or if it were not\r\npossible to sail by reason of contrary winds, then he had to carry his\r\ncargo round the head of the Delta in boats to Naucratis: thus highly\r\nwas Naucratis privileged. Moreover when the Amphictyons had let out the\r\ncontract for building the temple which now exists at Delphi, agreeing to\r\npay a sum of three hundred talents (for the temple which formerly stood\r\nthere had been burnt down of itself), it fell to the share of the people\r\nof Delphi to provide the fourth part of the payment; and accordingly the\r\nDelphians went about to various cities and collected contributions. And\r\nwhen they did this they got from Egypt as much as from any place, for\r\nAmasis gave them a thousand talents' weight of alum, while the Hellenes\r\nwho dwelt in Egypt gave them twenty pounds of silver.\r\n\r\nAlso with the people of Kyrene Amasis made an agreement for friendship\r\nand alliance; and he resolved too to marry a wife from thence, whether\r\nbecause he desired to have a wife of Hellenic race, or, apart from that,\r\non account of friendship for the people of Kyrene: however that may be,\r\nhe married, some say the daughter of Battos, others of Arkesilaos, and\r\nothers of Critobulos, a man of repute among the citizens; and her name\r\nwas Ladike. Now whenever Amasis lay with her he found himself unable to\r\nhave intercourse, but with his other wives he associated as he was wont;\r\nand as this happened repeatedly, Amasis said to his wife, whose name was\r\nLadike: \"Woman, thou hast given me drugs, and thou shall surely perish\r\nmore miserably than any other.\" Then Ladike, when by her denials Amasis\r\nwas not at all appeased in his anger against her, made a vow in her\r\nsoul to Aphrodite, that if Amasis on that night had intercourse with\r\nher (seeing that this was the remedy for her danger), she would send an\r\nimage to be dedicated to her at Kyrene; and after the vow immediately\r\nAmasis had intercourse, and from thenceforth whenever Amasis came in to\r\nher he had intercourse with her; and after this he became very greatly\r\nattached to her. And Ladike paid the vow that she had made to the\r\ngoddess; for she had an image made and sent it to Kyrene, and it is\r\nstill preserved even to my own time, standing with its face turned away\r\nfrom the city of the Kyrenians. This Ladike Cambyses, having conquered\r\nEgypt and heard from her who she was, sent back unharmed to Kyrene.\r\n\r\nAmasis also dedicated offerings in Hellas, first at Kyrene an image\r\nof Athene covered over with gold and a figure of himself made like by\r\npainting; then in the temple of Athene at Lindos two images of stone\r\nand a corslet of linen worthy to be seen; and also at Samos two wooden\r\nfigures of himself dedicated to Hera, which were standing even to my own\r\ntime in the great temple, behind the doors. Now at Samos he dedicated\r\nofferings because of the guest-friendship between himself and Polycrates\r\nthe son of Aiakes; at Lindos for no guest-friendship but because the\r\ntemple of Athene at Lindos is said to have been founded by the daughters\r\nof Danaos, who had touched land there at the time when they were fleeing\r\nfrom the sons of Aigyptos. These offerings were dedicated by Amasis; and\r\nhe was the first of men who conquered Cyprus and subdued it so that it\r\npaid him tribute.",
