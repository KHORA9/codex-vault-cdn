This has\r\nenabled me to bring out the present revised and enlarged edition. And I\r\nwish particularly to mention that many of the obituary notices of\r\nWaterloo officers given in the following pages were collected by the\r\nlate Mr. J.W. O’Brien, of the British Museum Library (formerly in the\r\nranks of the 4th Dragoon Guards), whose annotated copy of the ROLL CALL\r\ncame into my possession by purchase. Mr. O’Brien’s researches were not\r\nmade at my instigation or wish, but having been made, and brought to my\r\nnotice, I thought it advisable to secure and utilise this copy of my\r\nbook containing the aforesaid MS. entries.\r\n\r\nA special feature of the Second Edition is the list of non-commissioned\r\nofficers and men (given in Part III.) who served at Waterloo, and\r\nsubsequently received commissions in the British army.\r\n\r\n                                                         CHARLES DALTON.\r\n\r\n  _September 1st, 1904._\r\n\r\n                                -------\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART I.\r\n                                                                 PAGE\r\n\r\n   Preface to Second Edition                                      vii\r\n\r\n   Introduction to First Edition                                ix-xv\r\n\r\n   Abbreviations                                                  xvi\r\n\r\n   List of the Staff                                              1–8\r\n\r\n   Biographical Memoirs of the Staff                             9–39\r\n\r\n   British and Hanoverian Army, as formed in Divisions and      40–44\r\n     Brigades on the 18th June, 1815\r\n\r\n   Annotated Lists of Regiments engaged at Waterloo            46–230\r\n\r\n   Medical Staff and Departmental Officers                    231–235\r\n\r\n   Annotated Lists of Regiments which formed the Reserve      236–249\r\n     on 18th  June, 1815\r\n\r\n                                PART II.\r\n\r\n   Muster Roll of the Scots Greys                             250–255\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PART III.\r\n\r\n   Non-Commissioned Officers and Men at Waterloo who          256–266\r\n     subsequently   received Commissions in the British\r\n     Army\r\n\r\n                                PART IV.\r\n\r\n   A few Waterloo Heroes                                      267–273\r\n\r\n   Appendix                                                   275–278\r\n\r\n   Index                                                          279\r\n\r\n                     INTRODUCTION TO FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n            _Ah! Je les tiens donc, ces Anglais!_—NAPOLEON.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever since the days of Oliver Cromwell had any name caused so much fear\r\nin England as did that of Napoleon Bonaparte. From 1802 until his first\r\ndownfall, in 1814, a spirit of alarm and uneasiness pervaded all classes\r\nin Great Britain, from the King and his Ministers down to the most\r\nilliterate peasant. Those who were witnesses of, and participators in,\r\nthis panic have now passed away, but the national pride which our\r\nvictory over Napoleon at Waterloo excited in every Briton’s breast is as\r\nstrong as ever, and will last till the crack of doom.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1803, a little pamphlet, entitled _Important Considerations for\r\nthe People of this Kingdom_, was published in London, and “sent to the\r\nofficiating minister of every parish in England.” This pamphlet, which\r\nbears the Royal Arms of England, was an appeal from the Government to\r\nthe Nation, and a diatribe against Napoleon. Mark the closing lines of\r\nthis appeal: “Shall we, who are abundantly supplied with iron and steel,\r\npowder and lead—shall we, who have a fleet superior to the maritime\r\nforce of all the world, and who are able to bring two millions of\r\nfighting men into the field—shall we yield up this dear and happy land,\r\ntogether with all the liberties and honours, to preserve which our\r\nfathers so often dyed the land and the sea with their blood?... No, we\r\nare not so miserably fallen; we cannot, in so short a space of time,\r\nhave become so detestably degenerate; we have the strength and the will\r\nto repel the hostility, to chastise the insolence of the foe. Mighty,\r\nindeed, must be our efforts, but mighty also is the need.” The idea of a\r\nFrench invasion was slow in forcing its way into the minds of the\r\nuneducated classes in England. When they first heard of such a\r\npossibility they thought it of no more consequence than the invasion of\r\nScotland by Charles Edward Stuart with a mere handful of Frenchmen at\r\nhis back. They also thought less of the projected descent from having\r\nheard so much in 1797, and during the Rebellion in Ireland in 1798, of a\r\nFrench army coming to the relief of the National party in that kingdom:—\r\n\r\n                    “For the French are on the sea,\r\n                      Says the Shan Van Vaugh,\r\n                    And Ireland will soon be free,\r\n                      Says the Shan Van Vaugh.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet nothing had come of all this talk! But when the nation at large\r\nhad fully grasped the possibility of a Napoleonic invasion, Pitt had no\r\ndifficulty in raising the sinews of war. No fewer than 300,000 men\r\nenrolled themselves in volunteer corps and defence associations. The\r\narmy and navy were increased, and everything was done that was possible\r\nto counteract the power of that wonderful man, who, in the short space\r\nof a few years, had, speaking metaphorically, built a Great Wall of\r\nChina round the British Isles, shutting the English out of the commerce\r\nof Europe. Our preparations were none too soon. In 1805 the battle of\r\nAusterlitz established the supremacy of Napoleon over Austria and\r\nRussia. Fortunately for England, Nelson’s crowning victory at Trafalgar\r\nindefinitely postponed Napoleon’s invasion scheme; but we were still\r\nengaged in a gigantic war, single-handed, with half of Europe our\r\ndeclared, and the other half our enforced, enemies. Nelson was dead;\r\nPitt was dying from the weight of anxieties which pressed upon him in\r\nthis tremendous crisis; Hanover had been taken from us. The outlook was\r\nvery gloomy, and affairs became more complicated in 1807, when the\r\nmilitary expeditions, arranged by Lord Grenville’s ministry, against\r\nConstantinople and Egypt, had turned out failures, and resulted in the\r\nTurks declaring war against us and confiscating all British property.\r\nAnd yet in 1807 Napoleon had not yet reached the zenith of his power.\r\nFor the next five years he held the destinies of nearly the whole of\r\nEurope in his own hands. Monarchies of long standing were disestablished\r\nand new kingdoms—Napoleonic kingdoms—were raised up in their place.\r\nImmense French armies traversed Europe from Portugal to the heart of\r\nRussia, and every capital within that limit was, in its turn, subjugated\r\nto the French yoke. But in 1808 two British Generals stemmed the tide of\r\nFrench conquest in the Peninsula, viz., Sir John Moore and Sir Arthur\r\nWellesley. The first met a soldier’s death at Corunna, and the latter\r\nwas superseded by an incapable commander. But the British Government\r\nsoon found that they had made a grievous mistake, and Wellesley was\r\nagain entrusted with the supreme command in Portugal. Then commenced\r\nthat series of brilliant campaigns which liberated Portugal and Spain\r\nfrom the Napoleonic grasp, and only ceased after the battle of Toulouse\r\nby Napoleon’s abdication at Fontainebleau. In the spring of 1814 England\r\nhad a large army, composed for the most part of seasoned veterans, who\r\nwere fit for anything and worth millions. When war broke out again, in\r\nthe spring of 1815, at least half of the Peninsular army had been\r\ndisbanded—dispersed—and not to be had at any price. Some of the best of\r\nthe old Peninsular regiments had been sent to America in 1814, and\r\nseveral of them—the gallant 43rd Light Infantry being one—did not reach\r\nWaterloo in time to take part in the battle. Raw levies took their\r\nplace, and foreign auxiliaries helped to bring up Wellington’s army in\r\nFlanders to the required strength. Of Wellington’s 106,000 barely\r\none-third were British. The remainder consisted of “King’s German\r\nLegion,” “Hanoverian Levies,” “Brunswick Contingent,” “Nassau\r\nContingent,” “Dutch and Belgian Troops,” and “Nassauers in Dutch\r\nservice.” Of this polyglot force the German Legion, both cavalry and\r\ninfantry, were deserving of the highest praise for their conduct on\r\nWaterloo Day. They formed part of the British army for nearly a dozen\r\nyears, and many British officers held commissions in the “Legion.” I\r\nhave been obliged to leave out the German Legion officers in the\r\nfollowing ROLL CALL (excepting those who served on the Staff), and it\r\nwould be invidious, when all did so well, to pick out the British\r\nofficers who served in the “Legion” at Waterloo and record their\r\nservices when those of their German brother-officers are omitted. I\r\ncannot even make an exception of Colonel (afterwards Baron) Hugh\r\nHalkett, who, like a knight in the olden days of chivalry, singled out a\r\nFrench general (Cambronne) in single combat, and took him prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe Hanoverian levies did well also, excepting one regiment, which\r\nrefused to charge the French when commanded so to do. And this was\r\ndoubtless owing to the _lâcheté_ of their colonel, who, when ordered to\r\nlead his regiment to the charge, declined to do so, saying he had no\r\nconfidence in his men. It is related that Captain Horace Seymour, who\r\nhad brought this officer Lord Uxbridge’s orders, addressed “a few words\r\nof plain Saxon” to him, “which no gentleman ought to have listened to\r\nunmoved,” but the only effect they had on the Hanoverian was to hasten\r\nhis departure to the rear. The Brunswick Contingent fought at a\r\ndisadvantage at Waterloo, having lost their brave leader (the Duke of\r\nBrunswick) at Quatre Bras. Of the Nassau, Dutch, and Belgian troops it\r\nis only fair to say that they were, mostly, utterly useless at Waterloo.\r\nThe glamour of Napoleon was upon them. They had lately been in his\r\nservice, and had a settled conviction that Wellington would be defeated\r\nand his army cut to pieces. “Come over to us, brave Belgians!” shouted a\r\nFrench regiment at Waterloo to their Belgian opponents in the battle.\r\nBut the “brave Belgians” preferred making “a retrograde movement for\r\nstrategical reasons,” and retired from the field, carrying news of\r\nWellington’s defeat to Brussels.\r\n\r\nNow for Napoleon’s army: This consisted on the 15th of June of about\r\n128,000 men[A]—mostly veterans who had served in many campaigns, and to\r\nwhom defeat was rare. Add to this, that they all belonged to one nation,\r\nand were all equally devoted to their beloved emperor. “No army,” says\r\nColonel Chesney, in his _Waterloo Lecture_, “was probably ever so well\r\nfurnished with leaders as his, as none had ever the like experience\r\nwherewith to train them.” It is no slight to Wellington to say that\r\nNapoleon was, for rapid and offensive warfare, by far the first general\r\nof his day. In defensive warfare Wellington was much in advance of his\r\ngreat rival. Taking the words out of Philip the Second’s mouth,\r\nWellington might have with truth said, “Time and I against any other\r\ntwo.” Once more: Wellington himself told Earl Stanhope that he\r\nconsidered the presence of Napoleon with the French army at Waterloo\r\nfully equivalent to an additional force of 30,000 men! Now this was the\r\ntotal of the force sent under Marshal Grouchy, on the 17th June, to\r\nfollow the Prussian army, which had been defeated at Ligny by Napoleon\r\non the previous day, and which was supposed to be in full retreat on\r\nNamur and Liége, so that, in round numbers, Napoleon was himself\r\nconsidered equal to a whole army corps! If the British had a Picton, the\r\nFrench had a Ney, who was considered almost Napoleon’s equal in handling\r\ntroops in the field, and who had pressed us so sorely at Quatre Bras, on\r\nthe 16th of June, when only half our army had arrived at that position.\r\nThen as a leader of cavalry Lord Uxbridge was well matched by\r\nKellermann, whose fame as a cavalry general dated from Marengo. And\r\nGeneral Mouton (Count Lobau) was an infantry leader of whom any army\r\nmight have been proud. It was he who, at the head of the Imperial Foot\r\nGuards, had wrested the victory from the Prussians on the bloody field\r\nof Lützen, in 1813, and saved the French army from a reverse. Enough has\r\nnow been said to show what a splendid army the British had opposed to\r\nthem on the 18th of June, 1815. “I have them at last, these English!”\r\nexclaimed Napoleon, in a transport of joy, early in the morning of that\r\nday, when he saw our army drawn up in position, with their backs to the\r\nforest of Soignies. But he underrated Wellington’s generalship, nor\r\ncould he foresee how the British generals, officers, and men of all\r\nranks would fight that memorable day, when the eyes of all Europe were\r\nupon them, because upon the issue of that contest depended the fate of\r\nempires and kingdoms, as well as the future peace of the world. And\r\nknowing, as we all do, what glory the victory at Waterloo brought to our\r\ncountrymen and our country, we must be generous enough to give the brave\r\nPrussians the full share due to them for their co-operation on that day.\r\nHad it not been for them, Waterloo would have been as barren a victory\r\nas Borodino, and Napoleon would have retreated in as good order,\r\nprobably, as Blucher was able to do after his defeat at Ligny. As it\r\nwas, our troops bore the whole brunt of the battle without losing an\r\ninch of ground, and the arrival of the Prussians, at the close of the\r\nday, sealed the fate of Napoleon.[B]\r\n\r\nFootnote A:\r\n\r\n  Lord Wolseley, in his _Decline and Fall of Napoleon_, says the French\r\n  army consisted of about 123,000 men of all arms and 344 guns.—ED.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn offering this, the first annotated Waterloo Army List, to the British\r\npublic, I must ask their indulgence for any omissions and errors it may\r\ncontain. Although I have spared no trouble in the matter, there must be,\r\nI well know, a few names of British Waterloo officers who have escaped\r\nmy notice. But when the following list is compared with the very\r\ndefective lists given by Siborne and George Jones (the foundation of all\r\nother lists), I think the following ROLL CALL will be found infinitely\r\nmore trustworthy. I have also added the regimental and army commissions\r\nof the Waterloo officers up to the date of the battle, and the honours\r\nand promotions bestowed after Waterloo. The war services of _many_ of\r\nthese same officers now appear in print for the first time, and are not\r\nto be found in the _Military Calendar_ of field officers which was\r\npublished in 1820, nor in Hart’s _Army Lists_, which date from 1840, and\r\nare such valuable works of reference. Of course, a large proportion of\r\nthe names I have annotated, genealogically, are names of well-known\r\nfamilies of the present time, but there are also many names in the\r\nfollowing ROLL CALL which belong to families that are now extinct or\r\nlost sight of. I have endeavoured to rescue as many names from oblivion\r\nas time would allow, but there are a certain number of whom I can give\r\nno information beyond their obituary notices:\r\n\r\n             “Here lies Pat Steele. That’s very true.\r\n             Who was he? What was he? What’s that to you?”\r\n\r\nAs regards the orthography of the names in the regimental lists, I am\r\nnot responsible, as they are copied from the “official” _Army List_. The\r\nsame rule applies to the precedence of the different regiments.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Colonel F.A. Whinyates, late R.H.A., for some\r\ninteresting information regarding artillery officers, and to George\r\nTancred, Esq., late captain Scots Greys, for the Waterloo muster-roll\r\nand some memoranda relating to the Scots Greys.\r\n\r\n                                                       CHARLES DALTON.\r\n\r\n32 WEST CROMWELL ROAD, LONDON, S.W.\r\n\r\n            _June 1, 1890._\r\n\r\nFootnote B:\r\n\r\n  “I should not do justice to my feelings, or to Marshal Blücher and\r\n  the Prussian Army, if I did not attribute the success of this\r\n  arduous day to the cordial and timely assistance I received from\r\n  them.”—_Wellington’s despatch to Earl Bathurst._\r\n\r\n                             ABBREVIATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n Par.                        = Peninsular.\r\n\r\n Pa.                         = Peninsula.\r\n\r\n G.C.H.                      = Knight Grand Cross of Hanover.\r\n\r\n K.C.H.                      = Knight Commander of Hanover.\r\n\r\n K.H.                        = Knight of Hanover.\r\n\r\n K.M.T.                      = Knight of Maria Theresa of Austria.\r\n\r\n K.

Educated at Eton and Angers Military Academy. Like Clive,\r\n    he was “a heaven-born general.” His fame far exceeded the many\r\n    titles he won by his genius. “I am going to dine with Wellington\r\n    to-night,” said a young Irish staff officer to a group of brother\r\n    officers at the close of a hard-fought battle in Spain. “Give me at\r\n    least the prefix of Mr. before my name,” said Lord Wellington, who\r\n    happened to ride by at the moment and had overheard the jubilant\r\n    remark. “My Lord,” replied the officer, “we do not speak of Mr.\r\n    Cæsar, or Mr. Alexander, so why should I speak of Mr. Wellington?”\r\n    The Duke d. at Walmer Castle, 14th Sept., 1852, and was buried in\r\n    St. Paul’s Cathedral. He had m., in 1806, the Hon.

Had acted as A.D.C. to Wellington\r\n    in the Pa., and it was by the former’s special request that the Duke\r\n    took him again on his personal staff just before Waterloo.\r\n\r\n               “Dying lamented CANNING lay,\r\n                 On MARCH he wistful gaz’d.\r\n               ‘How fares the Duke?’ ‘How goes the day?’\r\n               ‘All well’—his head he raised.”\r\n\r\nLt.-Col.

After repeated insults the French bully\r\n    ordered a glass of brandy, and, whilst sitting just opposite\r\n    Trevanion, drank it off, saying, in a loud voice that could be heard\r\n    all over the café, “A votre courage, Anglais.” “Trevanion slowly\r\n    rose from his chair, displaying to the astonished Frenchman the\r\n    immense proportions and gigantic frame of a man well known as the\r\n    largest officer in the British Army. With one stride he was beside\r\n    the chair of the Frenchman, and with the speed of lightning, he\r\n    seized his nose by one hand while with the other he grasped his\r\n    lower jaw, and, wrenching open his mouth with the strength of an\r\n    ogre, he spat down his throat.” The bully’s jaw was broken by his\r\n    adversary’s iron grasp, and he disappeared to be seen no more.\r\n\r\n    Horace Beauchamp Seymour was transferred, in 1815, to a troop in the\r\n    1st Life Guards.

The only family bearing this name, that the Editor\r\n    has been able to trace, came from Kirkcudbrightshire.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                             MAJOR-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nSir Denis Pack, K.C.B., W.\r\n\r\n    Only son of the Very Rev. Thos. Pack, Dean of Ossory, by Catherine,\r\n    dau. and heiress of Denis Sullivan, of Berehaven, co. Cork. Five\r\n    times received the thanks of Parliament for his military services.\r\n    Was one of the most dashing leaders of a brigade in the Par. War.\r\n    “He was scarred with wounds and covered with glory.” Commanded the\r\n    71st Regt. at Buenos Ayres when that city was retaken by the\r\n    Spaniards, and was sev. wnded. and taken prisoner. When he escaped\r\n    from prison, Pack was appointed to the command of a provisional\r\n    battalion stationed at Colonia. His fidgety and irascible temper\r\n    somewhat tried those who had to serve under him. One morning there\r\n    appeared written in chalk on the door of a barn the following\r\n    distich:—\r\n\r\n                  “The devil break the gaoler’s back\r\n                  That let thee loose, sweet Denis Pack.”\r\n\r\n    For his services at Waterloo he was made Col.-in-Chf. of the York\r\n    Chasseurs.

He was\r\n    eldest son of Capt. Anthony L’Estrange of the 88th Regt.—one of the\r\n    Irish representatives of the ancient family of Le Strange, of\r\n    Hunstanton, co. Norfolk. Was A.D.C. to Sir Denis Pack in the Par.\r\n    War, and his especial gallantry, on several occasions, attracted the\r\n    notice of Wellington. Made a brevet maj. at the early age of 26. His\r\n    right leg was shattered by a round shot at Waterloo, and he died\r\n    soon after suffering amputation. Had he lived, a great future was in\r\n    store for him. A pension was granted to his mother whom he had\r\n    supported.\r\n\r\n                           MAJOR OF BRIGADE.\r\n\r\nBt.-Maj. Chas. Smyth, 95th Foot, K.\r\n\r\n    Bn. 8th Jan., 1786.

Dns. in the Par. War. In the first Cavalry\r\n    charge at Waterloo, Lord Edward Somerset lost his cocked hat, and\r\n    went to the charge bare-headed. On his return, whilst looking for\r\n    his hat, a cannon-ball took off the flap of his coat and killed his\r\n    horse. He donned a Life Guard’s helmet and wore it during the\r\n    battle.

Robert Lambert, R.N. (2nd son of Sir John Lambert,\r\n    2nd Bart.), by Catherine, dau. of Edward Byndloss, of Jamaica.\r\n    Succeeded to the command of the British troops before New Orleans,\r\n    in Jan. 1815, on the deaths of Generals Pakenham and Gibbs, who\r\n    nobly fell whilst heading an attack on the “Crescent City.” The\r\n    disorganised state of the British troops, and the utter\r\n    impracticability of forcing the American entrenchments, induced\r\n    General Lambert to retreat, which he was able to do without meeting\r\n    with any opposition, having captured Fort Bowyer. With their natural\r\n    love of exaggeration, the Americans magnified both their victory and\r\n    our defeat:—\r\n\r\n                  “The English had ten thousand,\r\n                    Jackson only one;\r\n                  But what was that to Jackson\r\n                    When him they turned their backs on?”\r\n\r\n    By a forced march from Ostend, Lambert’s brigade arrived at Waterloo\r\n    just as the battle was commencing. G.C.B. Col.-in-Chf. 10th Foot,\r\n    1824. M., 19th Oct., 1816, a dau. of John Mount, of Brocklehurst, in\r\n    the New Forest.

Went out again under Sir E. Pakenham, and was present at\r\n    the attack upon the enemy’s lines near New Orleans. Promoted brevet\r\n    lt.-col. for his services at Waterloo.

In Sir D. Baird’s\r\n    despatch, announcing the victory of the British troops, occurs this\r\n    passage: “Your lordship will perceive the name of Lt.-Col. Grant\r\n    among the wounded; but the heroic spirit of this officer was not\r\n    subdued by his misfortune, and he continued to lead his men to glory\r\n    as long as an enemy was opposed to the 72nd Regt.” The following is\r\n    an authentic anecdote:—\r\n\r\n    Sir Colquhoun Grant, being in command of a regt. at Clonmel, he gave\r\n    offence in some way to an honest shopkeeper, named Mulcahy, who\r\n    struck him on the parade, in presence of his whole corps. The\r\n    officers rushed forward to seize the delinquent, but Sir Colquhoun\r\n    interposed, declaring that he had been the aggressor, and as the\r\n    gentleman thought proper to resent his conduct in so gross a manner,\r\n    it remained for him to seek the usual reparation. “Oh!” exclaimed\r\n    Mulcahy, “if it’s for fighting you are, I’ll fight you; but it shall\r\n    neither be with swords nor pistols, nor anything else but my two\r\n    fists” (and fine big mutton fists they were, sure enough). “Well,\r\n    then,” replied the gallant officer, “with all my heart. By insulting\r\n    you, I have put myself on a level with you, and of course cannot\r\n    refuse to meet you on your own terms. Come along, sir.” The men were\r\n    dismissed; and Col. Grant, accompanied by his adversary and some\r\n    mutual friends, repaired to the mess-room, where he very speedily\r\n    closed up Mr. Mulcahy’s peepers, and sent him home perfectly\r\n    satisfied. That was the proudest day of Mulcahy’s life, and many a\r\n    time has he boasted of the black eye he got from a K.C.B., as if it\r\n    were an honourable ordinary emblazoned upon his escutcheon. “Ever\r\n    since that morning,” would he say, “let me meet Sir Colquhoun Grant,\r\n    where I might, in town or country, among lords or ladies, dressed in\r\n    plain clothes or dizened out in gold and scarlet, he would give me\r\n    his hand and say,‘How are you, Billy?’”\r\n\r\n    In Aug., 1808, Grant was appointed lt.-col. of the 15th Lt. Dns.,\r\n    and served in the Pa. Had five horses shot under him at Waterloo.\r\n    G.C.B., G.C.H. Col.-in-Chf. 15th Hussars, 1827. Lt.-Gen. Succeeded\r\n    to a large property at Frampton, co.

In 1830 his name was still on h. p. list.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                             MAJOR-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nSir James Lyon, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n    It is to be recorded of this officer that he had served on board the\r\n    fleet under Lord Howe, and was present at the glorious action of 1st\r\n    June, 1794—his regt. being at that time employed as marines. Was\r\n    with the reserve at Hal, and did not share in the great battle of\r\n    18th June. G.C.H. Governor of Barbadoes, 1828. Col.-in-Chf., 24th\r\n    Foot, 1829.

Peregrine Maitland.\r\n\r\n    Son of Thos. Maitland, of Shrubs Hall, in the New Forest. Joined the\r\n    1st Regt. of Foot Guards in 1792. Commanded the 1st Brigade of\r\n    Guards at the battle of Nive. The example he set, both at Quatre\r\n    Bras and Waterloo, had much to do with the victory then obtained\r\n    over the French. When Napoleon’s “Old Guard” made that gigantic and\r\n    final effort, on the evening of June 18th, to retrieve the fortunes\r\n    of the day, it was Maitland’s brigade which checked their advance\r\n    and drove them headlong down the bloody slope. “Now, Maitland, now’s\r\n    your time!” said Wellington, as the leading column of the French\r\n    Guards approached the crest of the slope where the British Guards\r\n    were stationed—the front rank kneeling. How Maitland responded is\r\n    told in the words of Col. J. H. Stanhope in his letter to the Duke\r\n    of York:—“Were it possible for me to add anything to the reputation\r\n    of Maitland by stating the gallantry he has shown, cheering on with\r\n    his hat off, I could dwell long on the subject.” Made K.C.B., 22nd\r\n    June, 1815.

Had ridden and won a race at the Grammont\r\n    Races on 13th June, and was dead on the 16th. Was acting as adjutant\r\n    to Lord Saltoun. His horse, a fine thoroughbred, refused a fence,\r\n    and tried to wheel round. As Lord Saltoun was passing down a path\r\n    close by, a body fell across his horse’s neck and rolled off. It was\r\n    poor Hay, who had been picked off by a French cavalry skirmisher,\r\n    who was, in his turn, shot dead by a Grenadier. James, Lord Hay,\r\n    eldest son of William, 16th Earl of Errol, by his 2nd wife—Alicia,\r\n    youngest dau. of Samuel Eliot, of the Island of Antigua—was born 7th\r\n    July, 1797. In _The History of the Grenadier Guards_ he is\r\n    erroneously called “Lord James Hay.” The latter officer, also in the\r\n    1st Guards, lived for many years afterwards.\r\n\r\n                           MAJOR OF BRIGADE.\r\n\r\nCapt.

His command\r\n    lay on the eastern side of the Pa., where there was a great lack of\r\n    good commanders. Adam maintained his reputation, despite several\r\n    reverses. When the French stormed and took Ordal, 12th Sept., 1813,\r\n    he had his left arm broken and his left hand shattered. Made\r\n    maj.-gen. 1814.

Waters, Unattached, W.\r\n\r\n    Afterwards Lt.-Gen. Sir John Waters, K.C.B. In the Par. War he was\r\n    attached to the Portuguese army and was taken prisoner. When\r\n    Wellington heard of this officer’s capture, he quietly remarked,\r\n    “Col. Waters will not remain long in the hands of the enemy.” Being\r\n    a reckless and dare-devil rider Waters made so sure of his speedy\r\n    escape that he mockingly told his captors they would not have him on\r\n    their hands for long. Such proved the case, for having managed to\r\n    get his spurs sharpened, he literally “rode away” from his pursuers\r\n    one fine morning, and they saw him no more. D. 21st Nov., 1842.

Howe De Lancey, K.C.B., K.\r\n\r\n    The De Lanceys were descended from a wealthy Huguenot family, who\r\n    went from Caen, in Normandy, to America, after the revocation of the\r\n    Edict of Nantes. In the short space of sixty years this family\r\n    produced three celebrated soldiers, viz., Gen. Oliver De Lancey, a\r\n    leading American loyalist, who fought on the British side during the\r\n    War of Independence, and, settling in England, d. at Beverley, 1785.\r\n    In another generation, an Oliver De Lancey distinguished himself as\r\n    a Christine leader in the Spanish war, and was killed at the siege\r\n    of San Sebastian in 1837. The third distinguished soldier of this\r\n    family was the above Wm. Howe De Lancey, who was only son of S. De\r\n    Lancey, Gov. of Tobago, by Cornelia his wife, who d. in 1817. His\r\n    early career was one of renown, and in 1799 we find him maj. of the\r\n    45th Regt., at the age of 21. On 4th April, 1815, he was married, in\r\n    Scotland, to the beautiful Magdalen Hall, dau. of Sir James Hall,\r\n    Bart., of Dunglass, by Lady Helen Douglas, dau. of 4th Earl of\r\n    Selkirk. The return of Napoleon from Elba once more called De Lancey\r\n    to the seat of war. Leaving his fair young wife, he proceeded, in\r\n    May, to Brussels, whither he was followed, the first week in June,\r\n    by his bride. At Waterloo, when riding by Wellington’s side, the\r\n    wind of a cannon ball knocked him off his horse. This, it was\r\n    afterwards found, had separated the ribs from the back-bone, and\r\n    caused a fatal injury. Wellington caused De Lancey to be removed to\r\n    a hut in a blanket. For some days hopes were entertained of his\r\n    recovery, and he was devotedly nursed by his sorrow-stricken wife,\r\n    whose perilous drive to the battle-field, and her experiences, were\r\n    lately given in the _Illustrated Naval and Military Magazine_, from\r\n    an old MS. narrative written by herself. After lingering ten days,\r\n    the hero died.\r\n\r\n                   “Fair lady’s love, and splendid fame,\r\n                     De Lancey did enthral.\r\n                   His loyal heart alike they claim,\r\n                     They sigh to see him fall.”\r\n\r\n                   ASSISTANT QUARTERMASTERS-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nCol.

D. 27th Aug., 1853.\r\n\r\nCol. F.E. Hervey, 14th Lt. Dns.\r\n\r\n    Afterwards Col. Sir Felton Elwell Hervey-Bathurst, Bart. He was\r\n    eldest son of Felton Lionel Hervey, by Selina, only dau. and heir of\r\n    Sir John Elwell, Bart. After Waterloo was appointed A.D.C. to\r\n    Wellington, which post he held during the British occupation in\r\n    France. The following anecdote is from _Reminiscences of Wellington\r\n    and Anecdotes of his Staff_, by Lord Wm. Lennox:—“Felton Hervey, of\r\n    the 14th, who had lost an arm when in pursuit of the enemy flying\r\n    from Oporto, always mounted himself and his orderly upon English\r\n    hunters, so as to make his escape should he at any time be\r\n    unexpectedly surrounded. Upon one occasion, when reconnoitring,\r\n    Hervey rode up, by mistake, to a small detachment of French cavalry.\r\n    Fortunately for him, the men were dismounted, and busily employed in\r\n    cooking their rations; but no sooner was the colonel discovered, and\r\n    his rank recognized, than the order to mount was given. Hervey and\r\n    his orderly, finding the odds greatly against them, immediately\r\n    started off at a tremendous pace to reach our lines. The French\r\n    dragoons were quickly in their saddles, for the prize was worth\r\n    gaining, and amidst wild shouts and loud halloes, gave chase to\r\n    their flying foes. The noise attracted the attention of some of the\r\n    enemy’s lancers, who, being posted nearer the English forces, were\r\n    enabled to cut off the retreat of the fugitives. The clattering of\r\n    the horses’ hoofs, who had thus joined in the pursuit, sounded like\r\n    a death-knell to the two gallant soldiers. ‘Your only chance,\r\n    colonel,’ said the faithful orderly, ‘is to make for that ravine.’\r\n    Hervey followed the suggestion; the ravine was narrow, with only\r\n    room for one horse to enter. No sooner had he gained it than, on\r\n    looking round, a terrible sight presented itself. The devoted\r\n    soldier, knowing that the life of his commanding officer could alone\r\n    be saved by the sacrifice of his own, had placed himself across the\r\n    narrow opening, and was literally pierced and cut to pieces. The\r\n    delay thus occasioned enabled Hervey to pursue his flight. Gaining\r\n    the open, he charged a stiff fence, and was soon out of sight of his\r\n    pursuers.” He m., 1817, Louisa Catherine, 3rd dau. of Richard Caton,\r\n    of Maryland, U.S.A.; was created a baronet, with remainder to his\r\n    brother Frederick, 3rd Oct., 1818, and d. s. p. 24th Sept., 1819.\r\n\r\nLt.-Col.

The irony of fate decreed that he should use his sword\r\n    against the Gallic army in 1815. His name disappeared from the Army\r\n    List a few years after Waterloo.\r\n\r\nLt. Basil Jackson, Rl. Staff Corps.\r\n\r\n    The following memoir of this distinguished veteran appeared in the\r\n    _Illustrated London News_ of 9th Nov., 1889:—“A gallant military\r\n    veteran, who has died at the great age of ninety-four, was reckoned\r\n    one of the four surviving officers of the British Army present at\r\n    the battle of Waterloo. Colonel Basil Jackson, born at Glasgow on\r\n    June 27, 1795, was son of Major Basil Jackson; he entered the\r\n    Military College in 1808, and, having received his commission as\r\n    ensign, did not join a Line regiment, but was transferred to the\r\n    Royal Staff Corps, where he learned the duties of the\r\n    Quartermaster-General’s Department and engineering. In that branch\r\n    of the Army he was employed in Holland and Belgium, in 1814 and\r\n    1815, and in the Waterloo campaign did good service in clearing the\r\n    roads, and on the Duke of Wellington’s Staff. He accompanied the\r\n    army to Paris, and was afterwards selected to go to St. Helena with\r\n    Napoleon. In that island he remained till about a year and a half\r\n    before Napoleon’s death. At a later period he was employed in Nova\r\n    Scotia and in Canada, taking part in the construction of the Rideau\r\n    Canal. He held the Professorship of Military Surveying in the East\r\n    India Company’s Military College at Addiscombe during twenty years.\r\n    After retiring from the army he lived at Hillsborough, near Ross, in\r\n    Herefordshire.” M. 28th March, 1828, the dau. of Col. Muttlebury,\r\n    C.B.\r\n\r\nLt. A. Brauns, Rl. Staff Corps.\r\n\r\n    Probably a son of the Col. John Brauns, of the German Legion, who\r\n    was killed at the battle of Talavera. The above officer bore the\r\n    names of “Augustus Christ. Gotleib.” Was placed on h. p. as lieut.,\r\n    in 1819. Living 1846.\r\n\r\n                      COMMANDANT AT HEAD-QUARTERS.\r\n\r\nCol. Sir Colin Campbell, K.C.B., 2nd Ft. Gds.\r\n\r\n    5th son of John Campbell, of Melfort, by Colina, dau. of John\r\n    Campbell, of Auchalader. In 1792 he ran away from Perth Academy, and\r\n    entered himself on the books of a ship bound for the West Indies. He\r\n    was met in the fruit market at Kingston, Jamaica, by his brother\r\n    Patrick (aftds. an admiral), a lieut. on board a man-of-war, who\r\n    brought him home. In 1793 became a midshipman on board an East\r\n    Indiaman. Two years later we find him serving as a lieut. in the 3rd\r\n    Batt. Breadalbane Fencibles, and in 1799 he was appointed ens. in a\r\n    West India Regt. Exchanged to the Ross-shire Buffs, and as capt.,\r\n    served under Sir A. Wellesley at the storming of Ahmednuggur, where\r\n    his distinguished gallantry won him a brevet majority. At Assaye he\r\n    had two horses shot under him, and was severely wounded. He\r\n    accompanied Sir A. Wellesley to the Peninsula, and was for a\r\n    considerable time on the staff of the army. For his services in\r\n    Spain he obtained the gold cross with six clasps, and in Jan., 1815,\r\n    was made K.C.B. He was a splendid soldier, but a bad French scholar.\r\n    “When he wished his dinner to be arranged on the table, he used, as\r\n    it were, to address the dishes, ‘_Bif-teck venez içi! Petits pâtés\r\n    allez là!_’” (anecdote by Wellington). Was Governor of Ceylon from\r\n    1840–7. During his residence there he frequently heard from his\r\n    great chief, Wellington, his attached friend. “We are both growing\r\n    old,” wrote the Duke to Campbell; “God knows if we shall ever meet\r\n    again. Happen what may, I shall never forget our first meeting under\r\n    the walls of Ahmednuggur.” Sir Colin returned to England in June,\r\n    1847, and d. on the 13th of same month, in London, aged seventy-one,\r\n    and was buried in St. James’s Church, Piccadilly.\r\n\r\n                      BRITISH AND HANOVERIAN ARMY\r\n                                   AT\r\n                               WATERLOO,\r\n\r\n     _As formed in Divisions and Brigades on the 18th June, 1815._\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n                                CAVALRY.\r\n\r\n         Commanded by Lieut.-Gen. the Earl of UXBRIDGE, G.C.B.\r\n\r\n  _1st Brigade._—Commanded by Major-Gen.

D. 7th March,\r\n  1869, unm.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  The name of Dorville has only been known in England for a little over\r\n  a century; but it is that of a well-known Norman family which\r\n  flourished for six hundred years in France prior to its exodus from\r\n  France to North Germany, for religious causes, early in the 17th\r\n  century. From Germany the “d’Orvilles” migrated to Holland, where the\r\n  family left its mark in the person of the learned James Philip\r\n  Dorville, professor of history and languages to a Dutch university,\r\n  and likewise a Sicilian explorer, whose valuable book on Sicily (with\r\n  rare illustrations), written in the purest Latin, is treasured, with\r\n  other Dorville books, in the Bodleian Library. The professor’s son,\r\n  John Dorville, quitted Holland and settled in England. He bought the\r\n  Ravenscourt Estate at Fulham. M. Anne Gibson (grand-daughter of Edmund\r\n  Gibson, Bishop of London), and had three sons, the two younger of whom\r\n  were Philip and Thomas, both of whom entered the army and did good\r\n  service in the Par. War—the former being for some time on Lord\r\n  Anglesey’s staff, and the latter in the 1st Foot Guards. At Waterloo\r\n  Col. Dorville commanded the two squadrons of the 1st Dgns. “which\r\n  rushed into the second column of the enemy, consisting of about 4,000\r\n  men, and after a desperate fight returned with a French eagle.” In\r\n  this gallant charge Col. Dorville had the scabbard of his sword shot\r\n  away, and a bullet passed through the breast of his coat. Had three\r\n  horses shot under him. On the death of Sir Wm. Ponsonby the command of\r\n  the “Union Brigade” devolved on Col. Muter, of the 6th Dgns., who,\r\n  being soon after wounded, was replaced by Col. Clifton, and Col.\r\n  Dorville succeeded to the command of the 1st Dgns. Made C.B. for\r\n  Waterloo. Retd. on h. p. 8th March, 1827. M.

Falconar is noted as being “on baggage guard at\r\n  Brussels.” It is noticeable, however, that Falconar’s name appears in\r\n  the original “Waterloo Muster-roll” of the regt. given in Part II.;\r\n  and it may be that he re-joined the Greys before the close of the\r\n  battle.

Maj.-Gen. Sir Frederick Cavendish Ponsonby, K.C.B. and K.M.T.,\r\n  Gov. of Malta. 2nd son of Frederick, 3rd Earl of Bessborough, by Lady\r\n  Henrietta, 2nd dau. of 1st Earl Spencer. Bn. 6th July, 1783. Cornet\r\n  10th Lt. Dgns. 1800. Maj. 23rd Lt. Dgns. 1807. At head of this regt.\r\n  distinguished himself at Talavera, in 1809. Lt.-col. of the regt.\r\n  1810. At Barossa, with a squadron of German dragoons, he charged the\r\n  French cavalry covering the retreat, overthrew them, and took two\r\n  guns. Lt.-Col. 12th Lt. Dgns. 1811. Again signally distinguished\r\n  himself at the battles of Salamanca and Vittoria. His experiences at\r\n  Waterloo were almost unique, as when lying grievously wnded. on the\r\n  field, after a most gallant charge, in the French lines, a lancer who\r\n  was passing by and saw Ponsonby move, exclaimed: “_Tu n’est pas mort,\r\n  coquin_,” and struck his lance through the English officer’s back. “My\r\n  head dropped” (wrote Ponsonby in his subsequent narrative of his\r\n  experiences), “the blood gushed into my mouth, a difficulty of\r\n  breathing came on, and I thought all was over.” But the bitterness of\r\n  death was not yet past. Soon after, a tirailleur came up and roughly\r\n  searched him all over, robbing Ponsonby of what money he had about\r\n  him. He was hardly quit of this scoundrel before another appeared with\r\n  the same intent. At last a good Samaritan appeared in the shape of a\r\n  French officer, who administered brandy to the apparently dying\r\n  Englishman, and then passed on “to pursue the retreating British”!\r\n  What followed is best given in Ponsonby’s own words: “Presently\r\n  another tirailleur appeared, who came and knelt and fired over me,\r\n  loading and firing many times, and conversing with great gaiety all\r\n  the while. At last he ran off.” The evening came, and with it the\r\n  Prussians. “Two squadrons of Prussian cavalry, both of them two deep,\r\n  passed over me in full trot, lifting me from the ground and tumbling\r\n  me about cruelly. A German soldier, bent on plunder, came and pulled\r\n  me about roughly before he left me.” An English private next appeared,\r\n  and on Ponsonby telling him who he was, the soldier picked up a sword\r\n  and stood sentry over him. Next morning Ponsonby was removed in a cart\r\n  to a farmhouse, and laid in a bed from which poor Sir A. Gordon had\r\n  just been carried out dead. Col. Ponsonby had received seven wounds; a\r\n  surgeon slept in his room, and he was saved by continual bleeding—120\r\n  ounces in two days, besides the great loss of blood on the\r\n  field.—_Narrative._ M., 1825, Emily, youngest dau. of 3rd Earl\r\n  Bathurst, and had issue.

Patrick Doherty belonged to a good old Irish family which has\r\n  done good service to its country, both in the army and on the judicial\r\n  bench. In the two great wars in which Great Britain played a leading\r\n  part during the 19th century, the 13th Regt. of Lt. Dgns. (Hussars)\r\n  has been commanded by a Doherty; and three generations of this family\r\n  have been closely associated with this same regt. In 1796 Patrick\r\n  Doherty embarked for the West Indies with his regt. on active service.\r\n  It is on record that no less than twenty-two officers of the 13th Lt.\r\n  Dgns. fell victims to “Yellow Jack” when serving in St. Domingo; and\r\n  the skeleton of the regt., with two or three surviving officers,\r\n  returned to England. This fatality brought rapid promotion to Doherty,\r\n  and in 1813 he succeeded to the command of the 13th. For his services\r\n  in the Pa. he was made bt.-col. The editor of the _Military Calendar_\r\n  states that on Waterloo Day Col. Doherty was lying ill at Brussels,\r\n  suffering from a most severe attack of West Indian fever and ague; but\r\n  as it is probable that he took part in the operations of the 16th or\r\n  17th June, it does not debar him from being added to the roll of\r\n  Waterloo officers. He undoubtedly received the medal for Waterloo, as\r\n  well as the C.B. in 1816. Col. Doherty was subsequently made K.C.H.\r\n  Quitted the service in Dec., 1818, and d. at Bath, 20th Jan., 1837. He\r\n  was uncle to John Doherty, of Dublin, who held the high post of Chief\r\n  Justice of Ireland, and dying, in 1850, left, with other male issue,\r\n  the present Maj. H. Doherty, of the Artillery Militia, who formerly\r\n  commanded a troop in the 3rd Hussars.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Made C.B. for Waterloo. Served in the Pa. 2nd son of Samuel Boyse, of\r\n  Barrow, New Ross, co. Wexford, by Dorothea, dau. of Shapland Carew, of\r\n  Castleboro, same county. D., unm., 1833.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  There were three of this family in the regt. in 1815. Brook Lawrence\r\n  served thirty-eight years in this regt., and was made bt.-lt.-col. for\r\n  Waterloo. He d. at Brompton 11th Aug., 1823, aged 59.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Son of Col. P. Doherty. Promoted maj. in this regt. 8th Dec., 1818. D.\r\n  at Bangalore 12th June, 1819.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Served in the Pa. and in India. In the last charge made by his regt.\r\n  at Waterloo was wounded in the ankle, which troubled him ever\r\n  afterwards. Quitted the service in 1823. D. at Kames House, Millport,\r\n  17th Sept., 1852. The Clan Alester of Kintyre and the Isles is one of\r\n  the oldest in Scotland.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Promoted maj. in same regt. 5th June, 1823. M. Eleanor, eldest dau. of\r\n  Lt.-Gen. Sir Thos. Dallas, and had issue.

He had taken out his\r\n  watch to remark the time, when the regt. was ordered to advance; and\r\n  not being able to return it, he put it into the breast of his jacket,\r\n  and thus providentially his life was saved.” (Anecdote by T. Carter.)\r\n  K.H.

The following touching verses to the memory of this\r\n  gallant officer were published soon after his death:—\r\n\r\n                “Weep not; he died as heroes die,\r\n                  The death permitted to the brave;\r\n                Mourn not; he lies where soldiers lie,\r\n                  And valour envies such a grave.\r\n\r\n                “His was the love of bold emprise,\r\n                  Of soldier’s hardships, soldier’s fame!\r\n                And his the wish by arms to rise,\r\n                  And gain a proud, a deathless name.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Bn. 1st Feb., 1781. 4th son of John Thackwell, of Moreton Court, co.\r\n  Worcester, and a direct descendant of Rev. Thos. Thackwell, rector of\r\n  Waterperry, co. Oxford, in 1607. Served in Ireland during the\r\n  rebellion. Joined the 15th Lt. Dgns. as a cornet in 1800, and served\r\n  32 years in that regt., during twelve of which he held the command.\r\n  During the Par. war he boldly attacked and forced back at Granada 200\r\n  French dgns. with 50 men of his regt., making several prisoners, for\r\n  which he was recommended for a bt. majority. At Waterloo, when\r\n  charging with his regt., Thackwell was wounded in the fore-arm of his\r\n  left arm, “but he instantly seized the bridle with his right hand, in\r\n  which was his sword, and still dashed on at the head of his regt., the\r\n  command of which had devolved upon him. Another shot took effect on\r\n  same arm, but he immediately seized the bridle with his teeth.” At the\r\n  close of the day his left arm was amputated close to the shoulder.\r\n  Proceeded to India in 1837 as Col. of 3rd Lt.

In 1831, as maj. of the 14th Lt.\r\n  Dgns., greatly distinguished himself by the presence of mind and\r\n  determination he showed in suppressing the Bristol riots.

Dgns. at Bristol\r\n  the only available military force was a troop of the 3rd Dgn. Gds.,\r\n  which was ordered to protect the city gaol. The captain of this troop\r\n  remained in his quarters, and allowed a cornet of only sixteen months’\r\n  service to command the troop on this special service.

Disbanded in Jan. 1818.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  The star of the Dawsons was not propitious on the morning of the 18th\r\n  June, 1815. Whilst one brother had been sent to the rear on the\r\n  evening of 17th June as officer in charge of the baggage guard of 18th\r\n  Hussars, the eldest brother, John Dawson, 2nd Earl of Portarlington,\r\n  had betaken himself that same evening to Brussels or elsewhere. The\r\n  consequence of this step was that “on the morning of Waterloo, by an\r\n  unfortunate mistake, he was prevented from joining his regiment in\r\n  time to command it in the brilliant exploits it performed on that\r\n  memorable day.” His anguish was extreme. He joined the 18th Hussars,\r\n  and served with Sir H. Vivian’s brigade in the destructive and\r\n  successful charge made by that corps towards the close of the battle.\r\n  In this charge Lord Portarlington had a horse shot under him. No one\r\n  who knew this nobleman doubted his courage for a moment, but his\r\n  absence from duty on such an occasion necessitated his retirement from\r\n  the 23rd Dgns. in Sept., 1815. The Prince Regent showed much kind\r\n  feeling for Portarlington, and did his best to uphold the unfortunate\r\n  officer in the eyes of the world. Lord Portarlington purchased a\r\n  half-pay ensigncy in 86th Foot 21st Oct., 1821. Became lieut. on h. p.\r\n  10th Sept., 1825. Capt. h. p. 9th Aug., 1831. This rank was a curious\r\n  anomaly, as his lordship’s name had been retained in the _Army List_\r\n  as a “colonel” ever since Waterloo, and he was also awarded the\r\n  Waterloo medal. But the one misfortune of his life was ever before\r\n  him, and the remorse from knowing that he alone was the author of it\r\n  weighed upon him to such an extent that he took to dissipation, lost a\r\n  large fortune, and d. at a humble lodging in an obscure London slum,\r\n  28th Dec., 1845. In early life he had served in the Pa., and was\r\n  present at the battle of Talavera. He d. unm.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Commanded the regt. at Waterloo in the absence of Lord Portarlington,\r\n  and was severely wounded early in the day. Bt.-lt.-col. and C.B.\r\n  Promoted lt.-col. of this regt. 28th Sept., 1815. Placed on h. p. in\r\n  1818 on the reduction of his regt. D. in 1822. He belonged to the\r\n  Devonshire family of this name (Cutcliffe, of Damage), the head of\r\n  which bears the Christian name of “Mervyn.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Younger son of Joseph François Louis de Lautour, who came of an old\r\n  Alsatian family, for many years a banker at Madras. Served in the Pa.\r\n  with the 11th Lt. Dgns., and specially distinguished himself at El\r\n  Bodon. On 7th Sept., 1812, when in command of a squadron of 11th\r\n  Dgns., he attacked and took prisoners a company of French artillery\r\n  near Valladolid. At Waterloo he succeeded to the command of the above\r\n  regt. early in the day, and later on, same day, to the command of the\r\n  brigade. C.B., and K.H., and bt. of lt.-col.

Elder\r\n  brother to Col. John G. Woodford (see Staff). On the death of Sir\r\n  Ralph Woodford, Bart., Governor of Trinidad, Alexander Woodford became\r\n  the head of this ancient family. His father was descended maternally\r\n  from the Brideokes, of classical memory, of whom Dr. Brideoke, the\r\n  “sometime” chaplain to James, the 4th Earl of Derby, in the reign of\r\n  Charles I., was a good specimen of the “fighting parson” of olden\r\n  days. This same Dr. Brideoke became Dean of Salisbury, and, by his\r\n  extraordinary presence of mind and address, saved the heroic Countess\r\n  of Derby, and her house at Latham, from being stormed by the\r\n  Cromwellian army. In like manner did his descendant, Alexander\r\n  Woodford, defend the farm of Hougomont in the early part of the\r\n  afternoon of Waterloo Day against the repeated and vigorous attacks of\r\n  the French. C.B. for Waterloo. Had previously served in the Pa. and\r\n  received the gold cross and one clasp. Was also K.M.T., and K. St. G.\r\n  of Russia. Filled high commands in the Ionian Islands and elsewhere.\r\n  Col.-in-Chf. 40th Foot, 1842. Transferred to the Scots Fusilier Guards\r\n  15th Dec., 1861. D. 26th Aug., 1870.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Afterwards Gen. Sir James Macdonell, G.C.B. and K.C.H., Col.-in-Chf.\r\n  71st Highland L.I. Was 3rd son of Duncan Macdonell, of Glengarry, and\r\n  bn. at the family seat in Inverness-shire. Served in the Pa. and also\r\n  at Maida, for which he recd. the gold medal. Macdonell’s gallant\r\n  defence of Hougomont is a matter of history. More than once was the\r\n  place nearly taken by the French. “The French, however,” says Siborne,\r\n  in his graphic account of the battle of Waterloo, “succeeded in\r\n  forcing the gate; but the defenders betook themselves to the nearest\r\n  cover, whence they poured a fire upon the intruders, and then rushing\r\n  forward a struggle ensued which was distinguished by the most intrepid\r\n  courage on both sides. At length Lt.-col. Macdonell, Capt. Wyndham,\r\n  Ensigns Gooch and Hervey, and Sergt. Graham, of the Coldstream Guards,\r\n  by dint of great personal strength and exertions, combined with\r\n  extraordinary bravery and perseverance, succeeded in closing the gate\r\n  against their intruders.” The struggle for the possession of Hougomont\r\n  went on the whole day until the French retreat set in late in the\r\n  evening. C.B. and K.M.T. for Waterloo. D. 15th May, 1859.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  The historian of the Coldstream Guards, 2nd son of Wm.

Gosford, by Millicent, dau. of Lt.-gen.\r\n  Edward Pole. Col. Acheson was ordered to defend a certain part of the\r\n  wood at Hougomont on Waterloo Day. “The enemy made a tremendous\r\n  attack, and, at the first charge, the colonel’s horse was shot dead.\r\n  He fell under his horse, and was considerably stunned by the fall, in\r\n  which situation he must have lain some time, as the enemy had passed\r\n  and repassed, regarding him as dead. When he had recovered he found\r\n  himself a prisoner by the weight of his horse. He extricated himself\r\n  with difficulty by drawing his leg out of his boot.” D. unm. 24th\r\n  July, 1828.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Afterwards Gen. Sir H. Wyndham, K.C.B., M.P. for Cumberland and\r\n  Col.-in-Chf. 11th Hussars. Natural son of 3rd Earl of Egremont. Was in\r\n  eight general engagements in the Pa. “Seeing the carriage of Jerome\r\n  Bonaparte in the wake of the general retreat of the French at\r\n  Waterloo, he made a dashing attempt to capture Napoleon’s brother, but\r\n  Jerome leaped out by one door while Wyndham opened the other.”\r\n  Succeeded, in 1845, to the Egremont estates.

It appears from Plantagenet Harrison’s\r\n  _History of Yorkshire_, that the family of “Sowerby” dates back to the\r\n  reign of Henry I., when one “Sueni” was “Lord of Sowerby” in\r\n  Cumberland. Some interesting particulars regarding the Sowerby family\r\n  are to be found in Mr. Harrison’s book, but unfortunately they are\r\n  particulars of the far-away Norman times.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Afterwards Gen.

Stothert, killed in action. M., 15th Aug., 1832, Harriet,\r\n  dau. of P.H. Lovell, of Cole Park, Wilts. D., 11th Jan., 1865.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Has barely a title to appear in this list, as he was taken ill the\r\n  evening of 17th of June, 1815, and sent to Brussels. But as the\r\n  Coldstreams were under fire on 16th June, 1815, having arrived at\r\n  Quatre Bras at 4 P.M. that day, after a march of twenty-five miles\r\n  from Enghien, it would be scarcely fair to omit this officer, who\r\n  appears to have received the Waterloo medal.

Buried in the\r\n  orchard at Hougomont, in the defence of which place he lost his life.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  The family of Hotham has furnished some distinguished officers to both\r\n  our army and navy—especially to the latter service. But the most\r\n  notable member of this ancient family was John de Hotham, Bishop of\r\n  Ely, Lord Chancellor of England from 1316–1320. He was a great\r\n  favourite with the young King Edward III., and had the choosing of a\r\n  wife for that monarch. The story goes that he selected Philippa of\r\n  Hainault “on account of the largeness of her hips,” which he\r\n  prognosticated meant a large family, and the shrewd chancellor-bishop\r\n  was not far wrong, as Queen Philippa had seven sons. Lord Hotham, who\r\n  served in the Pa., and was wounded at Salamanca, was eldest son of\r\n  Col. Beaumont Hotham, of the Coldstreams, by Philadelphia, dau. of Sir\r\n  John Dyke, Bart.

War the British Army was reduced to a peace\r\n  footing. The 3rd Batt. of the 14th Foot survived this general\r\n  reduction until the spring of 1815, when the dreaded order for its\r\n  disbanding arrived. Before this became an accomplished fact the escape\r\n  of Napoleon from Elba, and the consequent war with France, put a stop\r\n  to further reductions. The 3rd Batt. 14th was ordered to Belgium.\r\n  Being composed chiefly of very young recruits, the 14th were ordered\r\n  to Antwerp to join the garrison there, but through their colonel’s\r\n  personal application to Gen. Lord Hill, this order was countermanded\r\n  by Wellington himself, who inspected the regt. from the window of his\r\n  hotel at Brussels. “They are a very pretty little battalion,” said he\r\n  to Lord Hill; “tell them they may join the grand division as they\r\n  wish.” And so it came to pass that the “peasants,” as the battalion of\r\n  _young bucks_ were waggishly styled, took part in the “combat of\r\n  giants.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Youngest son of the Rev. Thomas Holmes Tidy, chaplain to H.M. 26th\r\n  Foot, and afterwards rector of Red Marshall, co. Durham, by Henrietta\r\n  Augusta, dau. of the Rev. Wm. Skelly, by Lady Betty Gordon, dau. of\r\n  Alexander, Duke of Gordon. If “fighting blood” is hereditary, then\r\n  must “Frank Tidy,” as he was always called, have had a good share, for\r\n  he was maternally descended from Charles Mordaunt, the “fighting” Earl\r\n  of Peterborough, and had for his uncle the gallant Francis Skelly,\r\n  maj. in the 71st Highlanders, who gained renown at the siege of\r\n  Seringapatam. Joined the 43rd Regt. in Ireland as a volunteer at the\r\n  age of 16, and was soon gazetted an ensign. When serving with his\r\n  regt. in the West Indies “a mortality of from ten to thirteen men a\r\n  day reduced the 43rd to 96 rank and file, and Guadaloupe being\r\n  disputed inch by inch, the 43rd, at the time of its capture at\r\n  Berville, did not contain more than two officers and twenty men fit\r\n  for duty.” Tidy was confined for 15 months on board a hulk, subject to\r\n  the tyranny and cruelty of Victor Hughes, thence sent to France, and\r\n  eventually allowed to return to England on parole. Appointed adjt. of\r\n  the 43rd. Promoted capt. 1st West India Regt. 1798; in 1799 exchanged\r\n  to the Royal Scots. A.D.C. to Sir George Beckwith in the West Indies.\r\n  Maj. 8th W.I.

Bn. 13th\r\n  June, 1799. 2nd son of Wm. Charles 4th Earl of Albemarle, by his first\r\n  wife, the hon. Eliz. Southwell, dau. of Edward Lord de Clifford.\r\n  England may thank Wm. III. for having given us the Keppels 200 years\r\n  ago. It was this monarch who brought over Arnold Joost Van Keppel\r\n  (descended from Walter Van Keppel, Lord of Keppel, 1179) as a page in\r\n  1688, and who raised him from one high post to another until he became\r\n  Earl of Albemarle, a Knight of the Garter, and gen. of the Dutch\r\n  forces in 1702. This nobleman fought under Marlborough in the wars of\r\n  Queen Anne, and our last Stuart monarch stood sponsor to Lord\r\n  Albemarle’s eldest son, who succeeded his father as William Anne 2nd\r\n  Earl—a general officer and British ambassador to Paris. The two eldest\r\n  sons of the 2nd earl were equally distinguished in their respective\r\n  professions—the army and navy. Viscount Bury was A.D.C. to the Duke of\r\n  Cumberland at Fontenoy and Culloden. He subsequently attained the rank\r\n  of lt.-gen. and was com.-in-chf. at the reduction of the Havannah,\r\n  which brought him much renown. His brother Augustus became famous as\r\n  Adm. Keppel, and for his eminent services was created Visct. Keppel,\r\n  of Elvedon, Suffolk (extinct). Gen. Visct. Bury succeeded as 3rd Earl,\r\n  and it was his grandson, the sixth earl, who joined the 3rd Batt. 14th\r\n  Foot six weeks before Waterloo. The following Waterloo anecdote is\r\n  given by Mrs. Ward in her memoir of Col. Tidy (already referred to),\r\n  and is corroborated by Lord Albemarle himself in his interesting\r\n  autobiography published in 1876:—\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Keppel was sitting on a drum just in front of my father’s mare\r\n  when she was shot—he was even stroking the poor thing’s face at the\r\n  time that the ball struck her down, broke the bit of the bridle and\r\n  knocked him head over heels, drum and all. The animal plunging in her\r\n  agony, threw the square into great confusion, and her misery was\r\n  speedily put an end to by the soldiers’ bayonets.” On the 25th May,\r\n  1820, Ensign Keppel (then in 22nd Foot) was promoted lieut. Exchanged\r\n  to 20th Foot, 1821; Capt. 62nd Foot, 1825; and in 1827 was promoted to\r\n  an unattached majority. Lt.-Col., 1841; Col., 1854; M.-Gen., 1858;\r\n  Lieut.-Gen., 1866; and Gen. 1874.

She was no stranger to a battle-field, and had\r\n  received a severe wound in Whitelock’s disastrous retreat from Buenos\r\n  Ayres (1807) at the time her husband was a sergt. in the 95th.

The 28th\r\n  might have been appropriately called “Prescott’s Own,” as the\r\n  Col.-in-Chf., Gen. Robert Prescott, had been closely associated with\r\n  this regt. for 50 years or longer, and was lt.-col. commanding for\r\n  about 12 years. From 1789 until his death in Dec., 1815, he was\r\n  col.-in-chf., and took the deepest interest in all that concerned his\r\n  old corps. He had more than one godson in the regt., whose fathers had\r\n  fought under him in America, whom he advanced in their military career\r\n  by his own personal interest. And the 28th were equally attached to\r\n  their old colonel, who had seen much service in America and the West\r\n  Indies, where he held high commands. Like many others, before and\r\n  since, who have filled responsible situations in countries where the\r\n  native or “barbarian” element is largely represented, Gen. Prescott\r\n  was fully imbued with the idea of his own great importance. An amusing\r\n  instance of this is found in an order issued by him when commanding\r\n  the troops in Canada:—\r\n\r\n                    LIEUT.-GENERAL PRESCOTT’S ORDERS.\r\n\r\n                                        “St. Pierres, 16th _June_, 1794.\r\n\r\n  “Whereas Vice-Adm. Sir John Jervis has given orders, I am told,\r\n  frequently here on shore, and particularly by note dated off Point\r\n  Petre, June 11th, 1794, which must have arisen from great ignorance or\r\n  great presumption and arrogance.\r\n\r\n  “If from ignorance, poor man! he is to be pitied, but if from\r\n  presumption and arrogance, he is to be checked.\r\n\r\n  “It is, therefore, Lt.-General Prescott’s orders that in future no\r\n  attention whatever is to be given to such notes or orders, and his\r\n  signature to such to be as little regarded as that of John Oakes or\r\n  Peter Styles.”\r\n\r\n  A martinet he lived and a martinet he died. His last whisper on his\r\n  death-bed was an inquiry as to whether there was a Hessian sentry at\r\n  his door. Although he did not die in harness the veteran “Slasher”\r\n  died under the colours of the 28th, as on the death of the late Robert\r\n  Prescott (grandson of the above) the old colours of the 28th were\r\n  found among his effects and returned to the regt. They had doubtless\r\n  been worked by the fair fingers of the old general’s wife.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Succeeded to the command of the 8th Brigade after Quatre Bras.\r\n  Lt.-Col. 56th Regt. 9th May, 1816.

Fought at Busaco and Albuera, and other actions in the\r\n  Pa. Was an excellent horseman, and on one occasion in the Pa., when\r\n  employed on staff duty, he was galloping after the retreating French\r\n  when he came on an open portmanteau, in which he espied some silver\r\n  spoons and forks of an antique pattern. As he galloped past he bent in\r\n  the saddle and made a grab with his right hand at the glittering\r\n  contents. His dexterity was rewarded with several specimens of old\r\n  French plate. This anecdote is given on the authority of a relative of\r\n  the Editor, who used to meet the old general in society, who told the\r\n  story himself.

After the\r\n  battle it was thought necessary to amputate his leg; and three times\r\n  had the tourniquet encircled his limb, preparatory to amputation, when\r\n  each time the surgeon was called elsewhere. It was then decided to let\r\n  the leg take its chance, and Hamilton eventually recovered. C.B. for\r\n  Waterloo. Quitted the service in 1829 with rank of Col. All his\r\n  service had been spent in “the old three tens,” as the 30th were\r\n  called, and he had fought with them in Egypt and in the Pa. Had the\r\n  gold medal for Salamanca. D. at Woolwich, 4th June, 1838. In his\r\n  obituary notice, given in the _United Service Journal_, it is stated\r\n  that he was nearly related to the noble house of Lothian. Whatever\r\n  family he may have belonged to, he did it credit. He left a widow and\r\n  two sons.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  C.B. for Waterloo. Aftds. lt.-col. of 64th Regt. Retd. before 1824.

D. as col. on retd. list, 24th Dec.,\r\n  1841.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  It appears that this officer acted as an additional A.D.C. to Gen. Sir\r\n  T. Picton, at Waterloo. At the second funeral of Picton in St. Paul’s\r\n  Cathedral one of the mourners was the Rev. Dr. MʻNabb, from Canada,\r\n  nephew of the above. The antiquity of the MʻNabb is delightfully\r\n  illustrated by the well-known remark of one of their clan that “at the\r\n  flood they did not need to take refuge in Noah’s Ark, as the MʻNabbs\r\n  had a boat of their own!”\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Made bt.-maj. for Waterloo.

Joined the 2nd Batt. 30th Foot, as a\r\n  volunteer, in 1814, at the age of 16. Served under Lord Lynedoch in\r\n  Holland. At Waterloo, when only an ensign, commanded the light company\r\n  towards the close of the battle. His private journal, in which he\r\n  gives his experiences at Waterloo, is quoted from in Sir H. Havelock’s\r\n  military work, entitled _Three Main Questions of the Day_ (published\r\n  in 1867) in order to show how the bravest cavalry failed again and\r\n  again, at Waterloo, in breaking through the infantry squares when\r\n  those squares were well provided with ammunition in addition to their\r\n  bayonets. “Here come these fools again,” growled the 30th rank and\r\n  file as they prepared to pour a destructive fire on the advancing\r\n  French cuirassiers, which invariably emptied many saddles and sent the\r\n  remainder from whence they came. Served at the siege of Asseerghur,\r\n  and was aftds. milit. sec. to Sir John Wilson in Ceylon. Was promoted\r\n  maj. h. p. unattached, 22nd Nov., 1839.

D. at Clevedon, 4th\r\n  Nov., 1848.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  H. p. 1831.\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  An amusing anecdote relative to this officer is given in the _United\r\n  Service Journal_ for 1838. Col. A. Hamilton of this regt., had a very\r\n  valuable charger at Waterloo, and knowing that if it was shot in the\r\n  battle he would only get the Government price of £20 for another\r\n  charger, he exchanged horses, before going into action at Quatre Bras,\r\n  with his steady old quartermaster, who, being a non-combatant, was to\r\n  remain in the rear. The quartermaster’s horse was what is called a\r\n  “safe convenience,” but the colonel’s charger was very high-spirited\r\n  and fresh. Unaccustomed to the quietude of his position in the rear of\r\n  the army, he fretted and fumed at being kept back from the excitement\r\n  going on in front. His rider had a bad time of it, and was a source of\r\n  much amusement to the idlers and “non-effectives” in the rearward. The\r\n  narrator of this incident says that on the evening of the 16th June,\r\n  1815, Sir W. Ponsonby sent his A.D.C. to offer to buy Hamilton’s fine\r\n  charger (his owner being wounded), but the bargain hung fire in some\r\n  way, and the gallant Ponsonby lost his life on the 18th June, as we\r\n  have seen, from being badly mounted.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  Appointed assistant-surgeon 24th July, 1808. Taken prisoner at\r\n  Talavera and sent to France. Exchanged. Rejoined in Portugal, after\r\n  Busaco. Served at Fuentes d’Onor, Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca,\r\n  and capture of Madrid. Taken prisoner after siege of Burgos when in\r\n  charge of the wounded. H. p. 1817. Surgeon 1st Batt. 1st Royals in\r\n  July, 1821. Transferred to 17th Lancers in Sept., 1828. Surgeon\r\n  R.H.M.S.

Arthur Wellesley was appointed lt.-col. of this regt.\r\n  and commanded it for nearly ten eventful years. Wellington never\r\n  forgot his old regiment, and it is recorded that he honoured Sir Colin\r\n  Halkett’s brigade with several visits on Waterloo Day. In one visit\r\n  late in the afternoon of that eventful day, he inquired “How they\r\n  were?” The answer was that two-thirds of their number were down, and\r\n  that the rest were so exhausted that leave to retire, even for a short\r\n  time, was most desirable, some of the foreign corps, who had not\r\n  suffered, to take their place. Gen. Halkett was told that the issue of\r\n  the battle depended on the unflinching front of the British troops,\r\n  and that even a change of place was hazardous in the extreme. Halkett\r\n  impressively said, “Enough, my lord; we stand here until the last man\r\n  falls.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Afterwards Maj.-Gen. W.

This produced a grim laugh among the\r\n  men, as they knew what the subaltern did not—that the private had\r\n  spoken ironically, for he was an old offender, and had constantly been\r\n  punished by Capt.

Macara at Quatre Bras was inexpressibly sad. “He\r\n  was wounded about the middle of the engagement, and was in the act of\r\n  being carried off the field by four of his men, when a party of French\r\n  unexpectedly surrounded and made them prisoners. Perceiving by the\r\n  colonel’s decorations that he was an officer of rank they immediately\r\n  cut him down with his attendants.” His relations obtained Macara’s\r\n  Waterloo medal, which was for long in the Tancred Collection. A\r\n  touching poem to Robert Macara’s memory is to be found in the\r\n  _Waterloo Memoirs_; the following are the last three verses of a pæan\r\n  of praise sung by the Goddess of Fame:—\r\n\r\n                   “Here the Goddess ceased her lay;\r\n                   Weak, her wings refused to fly;\r\n                   Faint, her voice forbore to say\r\n                   How Macara dared to die.\r\n\r\n                   “Be it, then, to friendship giv’n\r\n                   Such a warrior’s name to save,\r\n                   While ’tis borne on breeze of heav’n\r\n                   That he found a soldier’s grave.\r\n\r\n                   “By unequal hosts oppos’d,\r\n                   Still he proved his valour true;\r\n                   For his bright career was clos’d\r\n                   On the plains of Waterloo!”\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Succeeded to the command after Macara’s death.

George Jones’s _Waterloo Memoirs_ is to be found an\r\n  interesting letter regarding Major Menzies of the 42nd, who was\r\n  dangerously wounded at Quatre Bras. The major’s name is omitted in\r\n  this letter:—“On the 16th June, Major ——, of the 42nd, preferring to\r\n  fight on foot, in front of his men, had given his horse to hold to a\r\n  little drummer-boy. After severe fighting he fell wounded near a brave\r\n  private, Donald Mackintosh. The drummer left the horse to assist his\r\n  friend Donald. A French lancer attempted to seize the horse, on which\r\n  the prostrate Donald exclaimed, ‘Hoot man, ye mauna tak that beast, ’t\r\n  belangs to our captain here!’ The lancer, little heeding, seized the\r\n  horse. Donald, with a last expiring effort, loaded his musket and shot\r\n  the lancer dead. A French cavalry officer, seeing the major bestirring\r\n  himself, rode up and attempted to dispatch him with his sword. As he\r\n  stooped from his saddle, the major seized his leg, and managed to pull\r\n  him off his horse upon him. Another lancer, observing this struggle,\r\n  galloped up and tried to spear the major and relieve his officer; but\r\n  the former, by a sudden jerk and desperate exertion, placed the French\r\n  officer uppermost, who received the mortal thrust below his cuirass\r\n  and continued lying upon the major’s body for near ten minutes, sword\r\n  in hand. A pause in the battle permitted some men of the 42nd to carry\r\n  their officer into the square of the 92nd, where he was found to have\r\n  received sixteen wounds.” Acted as major after Sir R. Macara’s death\r\n  at Quatre Bras until wounded himself. Promoted maj. 18th June, 1815.\r\n  Left the regt. in 1828. D. in 1854.

He was a soldier from his youth, and obtained his\r\n  first commission of cornet at the early age of fifteen, in 1792. In\r\n  1794 he served under the Duke of York; in 1795 embarked for the West\r\n  Indies; in 1796 assisted at the capture of St. Lucia; and, in 1801,\r\n  fought with distinction in Egypt. Subsequently he took part in the Pa.\r\n  campaigns, in command of the 1st Batt. of the 44th. At Waterloo he\r\n  bravely led on the 2nd Batt. of the same gallant regiment, and was\r\n  left for dead on that bloody field, having received several severe\r\n  wounds in the head and thigh. Owing to the attachment of a faithful\r\n  non-commissioned officer, Sergeant Ryan, who brought his wounded and\r\n  insensible commander under the care of skilful medical treatment, he\r\n  slowly recovered, and with his devoted follower returned home. A\r\n  chivalric soldier, an honourable and most amiable gentleman, General\r\n  Hamerton is deeply lamented by all who came within the influence of\r\n  his high and endearing qualities.” He m.

The Frenchman then endeavoured\r\n  to seize the standard, but the brave Christie, notwithstanding the\r\n  agony of his wound, with a presence of mind almost unequalled, flung\r\n  himself upon it—not to save himself, but to preserve the honour of his\r\n  regiment. As the colour fluttered in its fall, the Frenchman tore off\r\n  a portion of the silk with the point of his lance; but he was not\r\n  permitted to bear the fragment beyond the ranks. Both shot and\r\n  bayoneted by the nearest of the soldiers of the 44th, he was borne to\r\n  the earth, paying with the sacrifice of his life for his display of\r\n  unavailing bravery.” Promoted lieut. 26th Oct., 1815.

Led the Forlorn Hope on\r\n  two successive occasions during the siege of Badajoz, in 1811, when\r\n  Fort San Christoval was assaulted by the British. The second assault,\r\n  on the night of 9th June, is graphically described in _Reminiscences\r\n  of a Subaltern_:—“At ten o’clock at night, 200 men moved forward to\r\n  the assault, Dyas leading the advance. He made a circuit until he came\r\n  exactly opposite to the breach instead of entering the ditch as\r\n  before; a sheep-path, which he remembered in the evening while he and\r\n  Major MacGeechy made their observations, served to guide them to the\r\n  part of the glacis in front of the breach. Arrived at this spot, the\r\n  detachment descended the ditch, and found themselves at the foot of\r\n  the breach; but here an unlooked-for event stopped their further\r\n  progress, and would have been in itself sufficient to have caused the\r\n  failure of the attack. The ladders were entrusted to a party composed\r\n  of a foreign corps in our pay, called ‘the Chasseurs Britanniques’;\r\n  these men, the moment they reached the glacis, glad to rid themselves\r\n  of their load, flung the ladders into the ditch, instead of sliding\r\n  them between the palisadoes; they fell across them, and so stuck fast,\r\n  and being made of heavy green wood, it was next to impossible to\r\n  _move_, much less place them upright against the breach, and almost\r\n  all the storming party were massacred in the attempt. Placed in a\r\n  situation so frightful, it required a man of the most determined\r\n  character to continue the attack. Every officer of the detachment had\r\n  fallen, Major MacGeechy one of the first; and at this moment Dyas and\r\n  about five-and-twenty men were all that remained of the 200.\r\n  Undismayed by these circumstances, the soldiers persevered, and Dyas,\r\n  although wounded and bleeding, succeeded in disentangling one ladder,\r\n  and placing it against what was considered to be the breach, it was\r\n  speedily mounted, but upon arriving at the top of the ladder, instead\r\n  of the _breach_, it was found to be a _stone wall_ that had been\r\n  constructed in the night, and which completely cut off all\r\n  communication between the ditch and the bastion, so that when the men\r\n  reached the top of this wall, they were, in effect, as far from the\r\n  breach as if they had been in their own batteries. From this faithful\r\n  detail it is evident that the soldiers did as much as possible to\r\n  ensure success, and that failure was owing to a combination of\r\n  untoward circumstances over which the troops had no control. Nineteen\r\n  men were all that escaped.” The gallantry of Ensign Joseph Dyas was\r\n  proclaimed to the world in Wellington’s account of the two assaults of\r\n  San Christoval, but for all that a grateful War Office allowed him to\r\n  remain a subaltern for ten years longer!\r\n\r\n             “I know a man of whom ’tis truly said\r\n             He bravely twice a storming party led,\r\n             And volunteered both times; now here’s the rub,\r\n             The gallant fellow still remains a sub.”\r\n\r\n  In Dec. 1820, owing to the representations of Col. Gurwood and Sir H.\r\n  Torrens, the Duke of York promoted Dyas a capt. in the 2nd Ceylon\r\n  Regt., but impaired health obliged him to retire on h. p. 9th Aug.,\r\n  1821.

As an engagement was daily\r\n  expected he asked the date of commission of the young officer\r\n  proceeding to Waterloo, and, finding himself the senior, assumed\r\n  command of the whole—directed the junior to proceed with the invalids,\r\n  while he (Montague) returned to his regt. By so doing he was able to\r\n  be present at the great conflict.” Capt. in 40th Regt. 7th Aug., 1823.\r\n  Living 1830.\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  Younger bro. of Sir John May, R.A.

Sir D.\r\n  Baird, for the Cape of Good Hope; he was present with the regt. at the\r\n  action on the 8th Jan., 1806; and also at the surrender of the town\r\n  and castle of Cape Town on the 10th. He embarked at the Cape in April\r\n  following, with his regt., on the expedition to South America, under\r\n  Gen. Beresford. On the 25th June, the landing of this small force was\r\n  effected at the point of Quilmes, up the River Plate, without\r\n  opposition. He was present in the affairs of the 26th and 27th, which\r\n  terminated in the surrender of the city of Buenos Ayres to the\r\n  British; and was with the troops employed in dispersing the enemy from\r\n  the vicinity of the city, on the 1st August; at the defending of the\r\n  city on the 10th, 11th, and 12th, when the British were obliged to\r\n  capitulate, and become prisoners of war; and was marched, as such, a\r\n  considerable distance into the interior of the country. He next served\r\n  with the army in Portugal, and was present at the action of Roleia,\r\n  and battle of Vimiero. He served under the late Sir John Moore in\r\n  Spain; was present the whole of that campaign, and at the battle of\r\n  Corunna.

In Feb., 1815, he embarked with the\r\n  71st Light Infantry for North America, but was countermanded, and they\r\n  proceeded in April to Belgium, and he was present with it at the\r\n  battle of Waterloo. He remained with the regt., which formed part of\r\n  the Army of Occupation, until October, 1818, when he embarked with it\r\n  for England, and for Ireland in May, 1822. The command of the regt.\r\n  devolved on him in May, 1824, when he embarked with it for North\r\n  America, and was promoted lt.-col., 2nd June, 1825; he remained in\r\n  command of the regt. till June, 1831. Lt.-Col. Jones was wounded when\r\n  capt. at the battle of Vimiero; and wounded severely when bt. lt.-col.\r\n  at the battle of Waterloo, late in the evening.

At Waterloo the 73rd were literally cut to\r\n  pieces, and at the close of the battle only fifty unwounded men were\r\n  left out of a total of from 500 to 600 men. “Once, and once only,\r\n  during the dreadful carnage at Waterloo did the stern 73rd hesitate to\r\n  fill up a gap which the relentless iron had torn in their square.\r\n  Their Colonel, at once pushing his horse lengthwise across the space,\r\n  said, with a smile, ‘Well, my lads, if you won’t, I must.’ Immediately\r\n  his horse was led back to his proper place and the ranks closed up by\r\n  men still more devoted than before.” C.B. and K.W. for Waterloo. Was\r\n  twice md., and left issue by both wives. D. 30th May, 1845.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  D. from his wounds at Brussels. Bn. 16th June, 1778. 4th son of\r\n  Gilbert Maclaine, of Scalasdale, in the island of Mull.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  There were two capts. of this name in the 73rd in 1815, Anthony and\r\n  Henry. The former d. at Kandy, Ceylon, as maj., 5th Jan., 1819. The\r\n  latter quitted the service in 1820. The Coanes are Irish, but a branch\r\n  was settled at Bath in 1815.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Served in the Pa., and was present at Fuentes d’Onor and siege of\r\n  Badajoz. Was with the 85th in the Walcheren expedition, and with the\r\n  73rd during the campaigns of 1813 and 1814 in Swedish Pomerania,\r\n  Hanover, and the Netherlands. Severely wounded at Waterloo, being shot\r\n  through both thighs by a musket ball. Retired on h. p. 1st June, 1820.\r\n  D. in 1855.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Son of John Garland, of Dorchester. Was desperately wounded at\r\n  Waterloo. After the battle he was carried to Brussels, and after\r\n  months of suffering was able to return to Dorchester. He was not then\r\n  expected to recover, and by some error his death was reported in the\r\n  papers in the autumn of 1816. Here is the _first_ obituary notice in\r\n  the _Gentleman’s Magazine_:—“At his father’s, Dorchester, Capt. John\r\n  Garland, 73rd Foot. He was in most of the Peninsular battles, and was\r\n  desperately wounded at Waterloo at the close of the action, only two\r\n  men of his company being then left, and was confined at Brussels until\r\n  his recent return to England.” But John Garland did _not_ die in 1816,\r\n  and lived to become a bt. maj. on unattached list in 1825, and a bt.\r\n  lt.-col. in 1838. His _second_ obituary notice is given in the _Annual\r\n  Register_ for 1851:—“Jan. 17. At Lille, Lt.-Col. John Garland, K.H.,\r\n  late of Quatre Bras Cottage, Dorchester, who was severely wounded at\r\n  Waterloo.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Capt. 2nd Aug., 1815.

Joined the\r\n  73rd with 400 volunteers from his militia regt., the latter being\r\n  induced to join the regular army by Leyne. His zeal was rewarded with\r\n  a lieutenancy in the 73rd. At Waterloo succeeded to the command of the\r\n  regt. and kept it as long as the regt. was in France. Placed on h. p.\r\n  5th July, 1817.

Morris, of the 73rd, in his\r\n  _Recollections of Military Service_, records that Ensign Deacon was\r\n  shot through an arm at Quatre Bras and conveyed by the baggage-train\r\n  to Brussels. “The officer’s wife, who with her three children had been\r\n  left with the baggage guard, passed the whole night in searching for\r\n  her husband among the wounded. At length she was informed he had been\r\n  conveyed to Brussels.... Conveyances there were none to be had, and\r\n  she was in the last state of pregnancy. She made the best of her way\r\n  on foot with her children, exposed to the terrific storm of thunder,\r\n  lightning, and rain, which continued without intermission for about\r\n  ten hours. Faint, exhausted, and wet to the skin, having no other\r\n  clothes but a black silk dress and light shawl, she yet happily\r\n  surmounted all these difficulties, reached Brussels on the morning of\r\n  the 18th, and found her husband in very comfortable quarters, where\r\n  she also was accommodated, the next day giving birth to a fine girl,\r\n  who was afterwards christened ‘Waterloo Deacon.‘”\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  Lieut. 4th Aug., 1815.

Sir\r\n  Alan Cameron, K.C.B. (then Maj. Cameron), who was their first colonel.\r\n  The officers were mostly selected from the half-pay list, and had\r\n  served, like their colonel, in the American war. The regt. served\r\n  during the campaign in Holland, and the mortality was so great that,\r\n  in 1799, this Scotch regt. had to be again raised. The call for\r\n  officers and men was nobly responded to by the Clan Cameron:—\r\n\r\n         “And wild and high the Cameron’s gathering rose,\r\n         The war-note of Lochiel, which Albyn’s hills have heard,\r\n         And heard, too, have her Saxon foes.”\r\n\r\n  How the “Cameron men” fought at Waterloo is testified to by the number\r\n  of their killed and wounded in that battle, and it is also recorded\r\n  that, when all the field officers and captains of this regt. had been\r\n  disabled, the regt. was led on to victory by Lieut. Cameron, a nephew\r\n  of Sir Alan Cameron, the col.-in-chf.; but which of the _four_\r\n  lieutenants of this name cannot now be traced. On the evening of 18th\r\n  June, 1815, 9 officers, 21 sergts., 7 drummers and 260 rank and file\r\n  remained unwounded out of a total of 41 combatant officers, 40\r\n  sergts., 11 drummers, and 684 rank and file—the effective strength of\r\n  the regt. at Quatre Bras.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Afterwards Lt.-Gen.

Vet. Batt. D. 1826.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  An interesting memoir of this gallant soldier appeared in the _United\r\n  Service Journal_ for 1837. He was a native of Dumfriesshire, where his\r\n  father had a small property of his own. In 1805 he joined the 52nd\r\n  L.I. as an ensign, and in the year following was appointed to a\r\n  lieutenancy in the Rifle Brigade (as the old 95th is now styled). As a\r\n  lieut. he had the good fortune to command one of the four companies of\r\n  the Rifles which, under Sir S. Beckwith, at the Pass of Barba del\r\n  Puerco, on 19th March, 1810, so gallantly repulsed 600 chosen French\r\n  troops who attempted to surprise them at midnight. I extract the\r\n  following from the above memoir:—“On the 19th Jan., 1812, he was one\r\n  of the officers who volunteered and led the stormers at the taking of\r\n  Ciudad Rodrigo, and was fortunate enough to come out unscathed,\r\n  although one of the first to enter that deadly pass. At the storming\r\n  of Badajoz on the 6th April, 1812, his name again stood on the list of\r\n  volunteers for the Forlorn Hope, but as it was claimed by a senior\r\n  officer of the division, he was obliged to limit his expectations to\r\n  one of the posts of honour with the storming party. Sir Andrew\r\n  Barnard, however, who commanded the Light Division, knowing how\r\n  peculiarly well qualified he was for desperate enterprise, assigned\r\n  him a post in front of the Forlorn Hope, in the command of a party\r\n  carrying ropes prepared with nooses to throw over the sword-blades\r\n  which formed the chevaux-de-frise, in the hope of being able to\r\n  displace it by dragging it down the breach, but Johnstone and all his\r\n  party were stricken down before they got within throwing distance. His\r\n  appearance next morning is thus described by a brother officer, Capt.\r\n  Kincaid, in _Random Shots from a Rifleman_, page 287:—‘The first tent\r\n  that I entered was Johnstone’s. With his shattered arm bandaged, he\r\n  was lying fast asleep, and coupling his appearance with the daring\r\n  duty he had been called on to perform but a few hours before in front\r\n  of the Forlorn Hope, I thought that I had never set my eyes upon a\r\n  nobler picture of a soldier! His whole appearance, even in sleep,\r\n  showed exactly as it had been in the execution of that duty; his\r\n  splendid figure was so disposed as if he was taking the first step in\r\n  the breach—his eyebrows were elevated—his nostrils still distended,\r\n  and altogether he looked as if he would clutch the castle in his\r\n  remaining hand! No one could have seen him at that moment without\r\n  saying—There lies a hero!’” Johnstone was wounded both at Quatre Bras\r\n  and Waterloo. Promoted maj. 24th Dec., 1829. Quitted the service in\r\n  1831. Was Colonial Sec. at Cape of Good Hope, and d. at sea 6th April,\r\n  1836.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  H. p. 21st May, 1818.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  Capt. 5th Aug., 1824. H. p. 28th May, 1829.

Defended a battery with his company at\r\n  Waterloo. D. at Cheltenham, 7th Feb., 1863. There were two officers of\r\n  this name in the Rifles in 1815, who appear to have been brothers, and\r\n  of the same family as Sir Richard Cox, Bart., Lord Chancellor of\r\n  Ireland.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Attained the rank of major 17th Dec., 1829.

In June 1811, was made bt. maj., and in\r\n  Nov., 1812, joined the British army in the Pa. Five months later was\r\n  appointed to command the Horse Artillery of Wellington’s army, and\r\n  served in this capacity until the conclusion of the war, winning for\r\n  himself, and his branch of the service, a high reputation. K.C.B. and\r\n  the gold cross, with one clasp. In the Waterloo campaign, Frazer again\r\n  commanded the R.H.A., and “his high reputation as an artillery\r\n  officer, combined with his firmness of character, prevailed on the\r\n  Duke of Wellington, who was at first not favourable to the exchange,\r\n  to permit him to substitute 9-pounders for 6-pounders in the troops of\r\n  Horse Artillery serving with the army. To this exchange, which\r\n  preceded the battle of Waterloo, may justly be ascribed much of the\r\n  success of that memorable day.” Another instance of Frazer’s firmness\r\n  of character is exhibited in the speedy way in which he made the\r\n  Prussians, two days after Waterloo, surrender all the French guns\r\n  which had been captured by the British, and which the rapacious\r\n  Prussians had annexed, and “regularly parked with Prussian sentries.”\r\n  Frazer’s interesting letters from the Pa. and the Netherlands were\r\n  published in 1859. These letters stamp the writer as a thorough\r\n  soldier, a perfect gentleman, a delightful companion, and a modest and\r\n  unassuming man, possessing a heart that could feel for others’ woes.\r\n  He m., in 1809, Emma, youngest dau. of James Lynn, of Woodbridge, in\r\n  Suffolk, and had issue two sons.

Sir Wm. Bell, K.C.B. Col.-comdt. R.H.A. His father was\r\n  Wm. Bell, a native of Tanfield, Yorkshire, a cornet in the Yeomanry,\r\n  but a surgeon by profession, who had a good practice in Ripon, and was\r\n  twice mayor of that town. His mother was Ann Atkinson, one of the\r\n  daughters of Henry Atkinson, town clerk of Ripon. The way W. Bell\r\n  became an artilleryman was as follows:—“Old Col. Quist of the R.A.,\r\n  head of the riding establishment (who belonged to a Dutch family),\r\n  came to Ripon to buy horses when Bell was a boy in his teens, and\r\n  happening to meet the youth in Ripon society, he took a fancy to him.”\r\n  Col. Quist used his interest in obtaining for Bell a nomination to a\r\n  cadetship at Woolwich Academy. In due course Bell obtained a\r\n  commission in the R.A., and soon evinced that he had a talent for “the\r\n  music of war.” He served in the West Indies from 1807–1810, and was\r\n  present at the capture of several of the West Indian islands. Served\r\n  in the Pa. from July, 1813, to 1814, and was present at five general\r\n  actions. Slightly wounded at Toulouse. His duties were very onerous\r\n  both at Quatre Bras and Waterloo, where he was employed in conveying\r\n  instructions and orders to officers commanding batteries in all parts\r\n  of the field. He had the narrowest escape of being crushed to death,\r\n  in after life, that ever befell anyone. “He fell from his horse in\r\n  front of a battery of R.H.A. at Norwich (or Ipswich), and the battery\r\n  going over him at a gallop, the drag-shoe of one of the guns knocked\r\n  his ear off!” Sir W. Bell resided during the latter part of his life\r\n  at Ripon, and d. there, unm., 28th March, 1873. Buried at Tanfield.\r\n  M.I. (The above is from information supplied by the late Gen.

His troop came in for the hottest part\r\n  of the battle on Waterloo Day, and suffered considerably in loss of\r\n  men and horses. Sir George Wood, R.A., paid the battery a visit on\r\n  that memorable afternoon, and was surprised to find so many cannon\r\n  balls whizzing round his ears. “D——n it, Mercer,” he exclaimed, “you\r\n  seem to be having a hot time of it here.” Hot it was for all parties\r\n  concerned, but the gallant way in which the gunners worked their guns\r\n  kept the French cavalry from reaching the infantry squares behind\r\n  Mercer’s battery. In after years Gen. Mercer published his _Journal of\r\n  the Waterloo Campaign_, which is a delightful book in every respect.\r\n  Attained the rank of gen. and col.-comdt., and d. at Cowley Cottage,\r\n  Exeter, 9th Nov., 1868.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Retired by the sale of his commission 5th April, 1831.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Of Herringfleet Hall, Suffolk. 3rd son and eventual heir of Maj.\r\n  George Leathes, by Mary, dau. of J.

Robe, K.               28 June, 1808 │\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  This officer’s name has been immortalised by Napier in his _Peninsular\r\n  War_. He came of a Scottish family, and was the eldest of three sons\r\n  of a retired naval officer who resided in Edinburgh. He was the pride\r\n  and glory of the branch of the army to which he belonged, and the\r\n  beau-ideal of what a Horse Artilleryman should be. He served with\r\n  great credit in Maj. Bull’s troop of R.H.A., in the Pa., from 1811 to\r\n  1813. It was in the campaign of 1811 that he performed the brilliant\r\n  action which Napier’s facile pen has so strikingly illustrated. This\r\n  happened on 5th May, 1811, when, the British cavalry out-guards being\r\n  far outnumbered near Fuentes d’Onor, were driven in upon their\r\n  supports, and Capt. Ramsay found himself cut off. It is a matter of\r\n  history how Ramsay, at the head of his battery, charged like a\r\n  whirlwind through the French squadrons who intervened between his\r\n  handful of men and the British troops, and rejoined the latter in\r\n  safety when given up for lost. And at the battle of Vittoria, Ramsay\r\n  again distinguished himself, but, by an unfortunate act of\r\n  disobedience to Wellington’s orders, he incurred the Iron Duke’s iron\r\n  displeasure. The story has been told as follows by a well-known\r\n  author, and differs somewhat from the account given by Col. Duncan in\r\n  his _History of the Royal Artillery_:—“I remember hearing a striking\r\n  instance of what, perhaps, might be called severe justice, which he\r\n  exercised on a young and distinguished officer of artillery in Spain;\r\n  and though one cannot help pitying the case of the gallant young\r\n  fellow who was the sacrifice, yet the question of strict duty, to the\r\n  very word, was set at rest for ever under the Duke’s command, and it\r\n  saved much after trouble, by making every officer satisfied, however\r\n  fiery his courage or tender his sense of being suspected of the white\r\n  feather, that implicit obedience was the course he must pursue. The\r\n  case was this: The army was going into action. The Duke posted an\r\n  officer, with his six guns, at a certain point, telling him to remain\r\n  there until he had orders from him. Away went the rest of the army,\r\n  and the officer was left doing nothing at all, which he didn’t like;\r\n  for he was one of those high-blooded gentlemen who are never so happy\r\n  as when they are making other people miserable, and he was longing for\r\n  the head of a French column to be hammering away at. In half an hour\r\n  or so he heard the distant sound of action, and it approached nearer\r\n  and nearer, until he heard it close beside him; and he wondered rather\r\n  that he was not invited to take a share in it, when, pat to his\r\n  thought, up came an aide-de-camp at full speed, telling him that Gen.\r\n  Somebody ordered him to bring up his guns. The officer asked, ‘Did not\r\n  the order come from Lord Wellington?’ The aide-de-camp said ‘No,’ but\r\n  from the gen., whoever he was. The officer explained that he was\r\n  placed there by Lord Wellington, under command not to move unless by\r\n  an order from himself. The aide-de-camp stated that the general’s\r\n  entire brigade was being driven in, and must be annihilated without\r\n  the aid of the guns, and asked, ‘Would he let a whole brigade be\r\n  slaughtered?’ in a tone which wounded the young soldier’s pride,\r\n  savouring, as he thought it did, of an imputation on his courage. He\r\n  immediately ordered his guns to move, and joined battle with the\r\n  general; but while he was away an aide-de-camp from Lord Wellington\r\n  rode up to where the guns had been posted, and, of course, no gun was\r\n  to be had for the service which Lord Wellington required. Well, the\r\n  French were repulsed, as it happened; but the want of those six guns\r\n  seriously marred a pre-concerted movement of the Duke’s, and the\r\n  officer in command of them was immediately put in arrest. Almost every\r\n  general officer in the army endeavoured to get this sentence revoked,\r\n  lamenting the fate of a gallant fellow being sent away for a slight\r\n  error in judgment while the army was in full action; but Lord\r\n  Wellington was inexorable, saying he must make an example to secure\r\n  himself in the perfect obedience of officers to their orders, and it\r\n  had the effect.”—Mr. Lover’s _Handy Andy_. To a man of Norman Ramsay’s\r\n  highly honourable and sensitive nature the circumstances of his\r\n  arrest, coupled with the omission of his name from the Vittoria\r\n  despatches, and the loss of a brevet he had well earned, may be said\r\n  to have inflicted a wound which neither time nor subsequent honours\r\n  could heal. Three weeks after his arrest he was restored to the\r\n  command of his battery, to the great joy of the whole army in Spain,\r\n  and after the battle of the Bidassoa he was promoted bt. maj. At\r\n  Waterloo he commanded the H Troop R.H.A., and his forward gallantry in\r\n  that battle attracted the fatal bullet which put an end to his noble\r\n  life. He was buried on the field by his great friend Sir Augustus\r\n  Frazer, during a momentary lull in the battle, but three weeks later\r\n  was disinterred and his body sent to Edinburgh, as the only\r\n  consolation to his aged father, half-demented with grief, who was\r\n  fated to lose his three gallant sons in the short space of eight\r\n  months. Norman Ramsay m., 14th June, 1808, Mary Emilia, eldest dau. of\r\n  Lt.-Gen. MacLeod, of Macleod. Sir Augustus Frazer erected a monument\r\n  to Ramsay’s memory on the field of Waterloo.

One of his sons (Forbes) was\r\n  a maj.-gen. of R.A.; two of his sons were—one (Frederick) col.-comg.\r\n  6th Foot, the other maj. of the 14th and 71st Regts. The eldest had\r\n  six sons, all in the army, viz.: Sir William, K.C.B. and K.T.S., gen.\r\n  and col.-in-chf. 92nd Highlanders; Frederick, K.H., col. 84th Regt.;\r\n  Forbes, col. R.A.; Archibald, lt.-gen. R.A.; Alfred, capt. 93rd\r\n  Highlanders; Alexander, lt. 83rd Regt. The last two died young. When\r\n  their father took the youngest to the Duke of York, C.-in-C., to ask\r\n  for a commission for him, the duke replied, ‘Yes, and if you had six\r\n  more sons they should all have commissions.’ In the retreat on\r\n  Corunna, my uncle Archibald, then in the Horse Artillery, picked up\r\n  his brother Frederick off the roadside, very seriously wounded, and\r\n  carried him on a gun-carriage into Corunna, and so saved his life.”\r\n  Forbes Macbean attained the rank of bt. col., and d.

He\r\n  extended his hand to me, which I held in mine while I told him of\r\n  Alexander Gordon’s death. He was much affected. I felt his tears\r\n  dropping fast upon my hand, and, looking towards him, saw them chasing\r\n  one another in a stream over his dusty cheeks. He brushed them\r\n  suddenly away with his left hand, and said to me, in a voice tremulous\r\n  with emotion—“Well, thank God, I don’t know what it is to lose a\r\n  battle, but certainly nothing can be more painful than to gain one\r\n  with the loss of so many of one’s friends.”’”—_Fifty Years’\r\n  Biographical Reminiscences_, by Lord William Lennox.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Slightly wounded at Quatre Bras, and his horse sev. wnded.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Served in the Pa. “Was the first surgeon to amputate with success at\r\n  the hip joint.” D. in Dublin in Nov., 1836.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Served in Egypt, at Maida, and in the Pa.

He was present at Waterloo as a\r\n  spectator, and although Wellington, his personal friend, implored him\r\n  early in the day to retire to Brussels, the Duke did not beat a\r\n  retreat until the battle was half over. He was accompanied by his son,\r\n  Lord William Lennox (a boy of 15), a cornet in the Horse Guards, and\r\n  extra A.D.C. to Gen. Maitland. By an unfortunate accident, a few days\r\n  before the battle, Lord William fractured his right arm, and had the\r\n  sight of one of his eyes destroyed, and although he left his sick bed\r\n  at Brussels to proffer his services to Gen. Maitland, the latter felt\r\n  himself obliged to decline them, so the disappointed youth followed\r\n  his father and another brother to the field, _en amateur_. Gen. Mercer\r\n  records in his _Waterloo Journal_ how surprised he was to see “a fine,\r\n  tall, upright old gentleman, in plain clothes, followed by two young\r\n  ones, come across our front at a gallop, from the Brussels road, and\r\n  press forward to so hot a fight.” This fine old veteran died from\r\n  hydrophobia, while holding the appointment of Gov.-Gen. of Canada,\r\n  28th Aug., 1819.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Probably a son of Gen. Archibald Macalister, who for many years\r\n  commanded this regt. D. at Axminster in Aug., 1869.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Served for many years in the Rl.

Clifton sent for me about the taking the Eagle and\r\ncolours. He asked me if I had any person that see me take the Eagle; I\r\ntold him that you see me, I believe, as the officer of the French was\r\nmaking away with it. I belonged to your troop at that time, and you gave\r\nme orders to charge him, which I did, and took it from him. When I\r\nstated it to him this day he wants to know the particulars about it, and\r\nme to rite to you for you to state to him how it was. I would thank you\r\nto rite to the Colonel, as you was the nearest officer to me that day.\r\nSir, by so doing you will much oblige,—Your most obedient humble\r\nservant,\r\n\r\n                                                       FRANCIS STILES,\r\n\r\n                                                _Sergt. 1st Royal Drag._\r\n\r\nTo Lt.

The _Edinburgh\r\n  Advertiser_ for 21st June, 1816, has the following:—\r\n\r\n  “Extract of a letter from Sergt. Ewart, of the Scots Greys, dated\r\n  Rouen, 16th Aug., 1815:—\r\n\r\n  “The enemy began forming their line of battle about nine in the\r\n  morning of the 18th. They came down to the left, where they were\r\n  received by our brave Highlanders. No men could ever behave better;\r\n  our brigade of cavalry covered them. Owing to a column of foreign\r\n  troops giving way, our brigade was forced to advance to the support of\r\n  our brave fellows, and which we certainly did in style; we charged\r\n  through two of their columns, each about 500. It was in the first\r\n  charge I took the Eagle from the enemy; he and I had a hard contest\r\n  for it; he thrust for my groin—I parried it off, and I cut him through\r\n  the head; after which I was attacked by one of their Lancers, who\r\n  threw his lance at me, but missed the mark by my throwing it off with\r\n  my sword by my right side; then I cut him from the chin upwards, which\r\n  cut went through his teeth. Next I was attacked by a foot soldier,\r\n  who, after firing at me, charged me with his bayonet; but he very soon\r\n  lost the combat, for I parried it, and cut him down through the head;\r\n  so that finished the contest for the Eagle. After which I presumed to\r\n  follow my comrades, Eagle and all, but was stopped by the General\r\n  saying to me, ‘You brave fellow, take that to the rear; you have done\r\n  enough until you get quit of it,’ which I was obliged to do, but with\r\n  great reluctance. I retired to a height, and stood there for upwards\r\n  of an hour, which gave me a general view of the field, but I cannot\r\n  express the sight I beheld; the bodies of my brave comrades were lying\r\n  so thick upon the field that it was scarcely possible to pass, and\r\n  horses innumerable. I took the Eagle into Brussels, amidst the\r\n  acclamation of thousands of the spectators that saw it.”\r\n\r\n  On 18th June, 1816, Ensign Ewart, and other Waterloo officers, were\r\n  entertained at a public banquet in Edinburgh. “Nearly 400 noblemen and\r\n  gentlemen sat down to an elegant dinner in the Assembly Rooms, the Rt.\r\n  Hon. Wm. Arbuthnot, Lord Provost of the city, in the chair. After\r\n  several toasts had been given and duly honoured, Sir Walter (then Mr.)\r\n  Scott proposed a bumper to the health of Ensign Ewart, late of the\r\n  Scots Greys, whose bravery was conspicuous where he took a French\r\n  Eagle, and killed with his own hand three of Napoleon’s guard. The\r\n  toast was drank with great acclamation, and a general expectation\r\n  prevailed that Ensign Ewart, who was present, would address the\r\n  company. After a short pause, the Lord Provost rose, and, at the\r\n  request of Mr. Ewart, stated how much he felt honoured by this mark of\r\n  the company’s approbation, but that he would much rather fight the\r\n  battle over again and take another Eagle, than make a speech.”\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n                             6TH DRAGOONS.\r\n\r\n                              F.

He was\r\ncommissioned as a quartermaster the 31st Aug., 1815, and retd. with the\r\nrank of capt. in Dec., 1855. Living 1876. The following description of\r\nthe square of the Grenadier Guards during the afternoon of Waterloo day\r\nis by Capt. Gronow of that regt., and is certainly worthy of\r\nremembrance, exhibiting as it does the desperate heroism of the British\r\nresistance:—\r\n\r\n“During the battle our squares presented a shocking sight. Inside we\r\nwere nearly suffocated by the smoke and smell from burnt cartridges. It\r\nwas impossible to move a yard without treading upon a wounded comrade,\r\nor upon the bodies of the dead; and the loud groans of the wounded and\r\ndying were most appalling.\r\n\r\n“At four o’clock our square was a perfect hospital being full of dead,\r\ndying, and mutilated soldiers. The charges of cavalry were in appearance\r\nvery formidable, but in reality a great relief, as the artillery could\r\nno longer fire on us; the very earth shook under the enormous mass of\r\nmen and horses. I shall never forget the strange noise our bullets made\r\nagainst the breast-plates of Kellerman’s and Millhaud’s cuirassiers, six\r\nor seven thousand in number, who attacked us with great fury. I can only\r\ncompare it, with a somewhat homely simile, to the noise of a violent\r\nhailstorm beating against panes of glass.\r\n\r\n“The artillery did great execution; but our musketry did not at first\r\nseem to kill many men, though it brought down a large number of horses,\r\nand created indescribable confusion. The horses of the first rank of\r\ncuirassiers, in spite of all the efforts of their riders, came to a\r\nstandstill, shaking and covered with foam, at about twenty yards’\r\ndistance from our squares, and generally resisted all attempts to force\r\nthem to charge the line of serried steel. On one occasion two gallant\r\nFrench officers forced their way into a gap momentarily created by the\r\ndischarge of artillery; one was killed by Stables, the other by Adair.\r\nNothing could be more gallant than the behaviour of those veterans, many\r\nof whom had distinguished themselves on half the battle-fields of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n“In the midst of our terrible fire, their officers were seen as if on\r\nparade, keeping order in their ranks, and encouraging them. Unable to\r\nrenew the charge, but unwilling to retreat, they brandished their swords\r\nwith loud cries of ‘Vive l’Empereur!’ and allowed themselves to be mowed\r\ndown by hundreds rather than yield. Our men, who shot them down, could\r\nnot help admiring the gallant bearing and heroic resignation of their\r\nenemies.”\r\n\r\n                                                    Sergt. Robt.

This veteran and gallant officer was\r\nformerly of the 14th or Buckinghamshire Regt. of Foot, and had seen very\r\nlengthened service in the army, having served in the campaign of 1815,\r\nincluding the battle of Waterloo and the storming of Cambray; in 1817,\r\nin the East Indies, he was present at the siege of Hattrass, and in the\r\ncampaign of 1817–18, in the Deccan; also at the siege and storming of\r\nBhurtpore, in 1825–26. With the medal so well earned, he was one of the\r\nofficers receiving rewards for distinguished service; moreover, as\r\nhaving originated the measure by which was accorded to meritorious\r\nquartermasters of long service the nominal rank of captain, several of\r\nwhom, many years since, presented him with a handsome testimonial,\r\nexpressive of their obligation, and of his efficient aid.”\r\n\r\nOn Waterloo day, Sergt. Goddard was with an advanced party of\r\nskirmishers of the 14th, and about four o’clock the reflux wave of some\r\nFrench cuirassiers passed through them. They were, of course, fired at\r\nby the 14th skirmishers, and several bit the dust. One poor wounded\r\nFrenchman was thrown from his horse, and a comrade nobly returned and\r\noffered the soldier the help of his stirrup. An active light infantry\r\nman of the 14th, Whitney by name, who had shot one cuirassier, having\r\nreloaded, was about to fire at the mounted Frenchman, who was then\r\nrescuing his comrade, when Goddard interfered and said, “No, Whitney,\r\ndon’t fire; let him off, he is a noble fellow.” (Communicated by a\r\nfriend of Capt. Goddard.)\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n                         23RD REGIMENT OF FOOT.\r\n\r\n                             Charles Grant.\r\n\r\nSeverely wounded at Quatre Bras whilst serving in the ranks.

Had his horse shot under him in one of the charges at\r\n  Waterloo, and was thrown. As he got up, minus his helmet, which had\r\n  fallen off, a cuirassier rode at him and attempted to cut him down.\r\n  Godley managed to kill his assailant, and mounting the Frenchman’s\r\n  horse, rode back to his regt. who welcomed him with shouts of “Well\r\n  done, Marquis of Granby!” Discharged in 1824.

In one of the charges he fell\r\n  mortally wounded, and was left on the field. Corporal Scott of the\r\n  same regt.

Weir was found with his\r\n  name written on his forehead by his own hand, dipped in his own blood.\r\n  This, his comrade said, he was supposed to have done that his body\r\n  might be found and known, and that it might not be imagined he had\r\n  disappeared with the money of the troop.

Capt. Dansey very soon received a severe wound which obliged him\r\nto retire; and the party, after firing a few rockets, fell back a little\r\nto where its horses were standing. It was then commanded by a sergeant\r\n(Daniel Dunnett), who, on perceiving the advance of the nearest French\r\ncolumn towards the farm, dismounted his men as coolly and deliberately\r\nas if exercising on Woolwich Common, though without any support\r\nwhatever, laid rockets on the ground, and discharged them in succession\r\ninto the mass, every one of them appearing to take effect. The advance\r\nof the column was checked, and was not resumed until Dunnett, having\r\nexpended all his rockets, retired with his party to rejoin the guns in\r\nrear.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 STAFF.\r\n\r\nCol. C.H. Churchill was son of Maj.-Gen. Horace Churchill, and a\r\ndescendant of the Earl of Orford. In a letter to his father from “Le\r\nCateau, 24th June, 1815,” Churchill thus graphically describes\r\nNapoleon’s final effort at Waterloo:—\r\n\r\n“It was about four o’clock. The enemy had made great efforts, but our\r\ntroops foiled them everywhere. We could not follow him; he had retired\r\nrather than be beaten back. His position was very strong. About six\r\no’clock we perceived formation columns, cavalry and infantry, formed in\r\na great mass—the enemy’s artillery was brought to a more forward\r\nposition—and again he began to cannonade us. He opened a fire, the most\r\ntremendous ever known, I believe, in the annals of war—250 pieces, very\r\nclose, throwing shells and round shot, grape, and every instrument of\r\ndestruction. It is really not exaggeration to say we could not ride\r\nquick over the ground for the bodies of men and horses. Under cover of\r\nthis cannonade advanced Bonaparte at the head of his Imperial Guards;\r\ncavalry in a column on the left flank, and the Grenadiers of the Guard\r\non their right flank. They advanced most steadily up to our line in one\r\ngreat mass. They halted and commenced firing. Our troops were literally\r\nmowed down. The fire was so great nothing could stand.” The writer then\r\ngoes on to describe how he had two horses killed under him, and a third\r\ndisabled by a shot in the knee before the advancing French columns were\r\n“licked back.” “The Prussians,” continues Churchill, “now came upon the\r\nenemy’s flank, and this obliged them to hurry their retreat.”\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\nSIR DE LACY EVANS.\r\n\r\nIn Kensal Green Cemetery is a handsome altar monument to the memory of\r\nSir De Lacy Evans, his wife, and his brother, Maj.-Gen.

As to the\r\nfall of your son, and my esteemed friend, I can only say that few young\r\nmen have left this life more sincerely regretted, and his exertions on\r\nthe 18th will ever endear his memory to all who witnessed his noble\r\nconduct on that day.

About five o’clock on the\r\n18th your son received a mortal wound, and about the same time the\r\nfollowing day he died at the village of Waterloo, after twice having\r\ntaken leave of me in the most friendly and affectionate manner. I was\r\ntoo ill to ask him any questions; indeed, I was so distressed when I saw\r\nhim at his last moments, that I could only shake him by the hand, and in\r\nthe course of a few minutes he expired.

She relates that on the\r\nmorning of the day of the great battle she ran away from her parents and\r\nmade her way through the woods, being curious to see what was going on.\r\nShe was close to Hougomont when the place was attacked by the French\r\ntroops, and remained in hiding for hours, not daring to move. The\r\ncannonade having diminished she ventured towards the farm, but fled\r\nhorror-stricken at the sight—the ground, as she expresses it, being like\r\nred mud, so drenched was it with blood. She ran across the fields and\r\nreached the Bois de Planchenoit, where she fell asleep, worn out by\r\nfatigue and excitement. At dusk she was awakened by the noise of horses’\r\nhoofs, and saw a troop of cavalry, headed by a man of short stature\r\nmounted on a curveting grey horse. He was riding slowly on as if in a\r\ndream, looking straight ahead and paying no heed to what went on about\r\nhim. The girl learnt on the same evening from her relatives, when she\r\nfinally reached home, that the rider was Napoleon. Madame Givron is\r\nremarkably active, and is particularly proud of her eyesight, which, she\r\ndeclares, is as good as it was seventy-five years ago. When her daughter\r\nMarceline, who, as she says, is only seventy-two, sits down to sew, her\r\nmother threads the needles for her.

He has been an inmate of Caterham Asylum for some years,\r\nand although unable to leave his bed he still enjoys a pipe of tobacco,\r\nwhich he indulges in frequently.”\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n                         INTERESTING SURVIVOR.\r\n\r\n“In the village of Rolvenden, in the Weald of Kent, there is living an\r\nold woman named Moon, who was present at the battles of Quatre Bras and\r\nWaterloo. Her father, a col.-sergt. of the 3rd batt. Rifle Brigade,\r\nserved throughout the Peninsular war, and took part in the battles of\r\nBadajoz, Salamanca, and other conflicts. He died of wounds received at\r\nWaterloo some months after the battle and before he had received his\r\npension. Mrs. Moon was born in the Peninsula, her mother doing work for\r\nthe forces when operating there. Though Mrs. Moon is now infirm, her\r\nintellect is clear and her memory good.”—_Morning Post_, 27th March,\r\n1899.\r\n\r\nNOTE BY THE EDITOR.—Mrs. Barbara Moon d. at Rolvenden in Oct., 1903. It\r\nwas stated in an obituary notice that she was four years old at the time\r\nof the battle of Waterloo and rode in a waggon over the field on the\r\nevening of 18th June, 1815.\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n               THE LAST BRITISH EYE-WITNESS OF WATERLOO.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Watkins, of Norwich, born 31st Jan., 1810, at Beaminster, near\r\nBridport. Her father, one Daniel Gale, was pressed into the King’s\r\nservice just before Waterloo. Gale’s wife and child followed him to\r\nBrussels and were in the women’s camp near the field of Waterloo. The\r\nchild remembers cutting up lint—saw many dead, and some stirring\r\nincidents of the battle. (_Notes and Queries_, 5th Dec., 1903). A\r\nportrait of Elizabeth Watkins recently appeared in _The Sphere_.\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n                      AN EYE-WITNESS OF WATERLOO.\r\n\r\n                        _From a Correspondent._\r\n\r\nIn a small cottage at the little village of Chapelle, within eye-shot of\r\nthe meeting-place of Wellington and Blücher after the most tremendous\r\nand fateful struggle in the world’s history, there was living on June\r\n18, 1815, a little girl, Thérèse Roland, thirteen years of age, who\r\nwitnessed all that took place on that historic day. Eighty-nine years\r\nlater she is still living there, a widow now, with her two sons of\r\neighty and seventy-eight, herself a bowed and wrinkled old dame of 103\r\nyears. This aged peasant, with faculties still clear and memory\r\nunimpaired, is probably the only living witness of the death-blow dealt\r\nto all Napoleon’s hopes on that midsummer day, which moulded the future\r\nhistory of an entire continent, and altered the balance of power of the\r\nentire world.\r\n\r\nA representative of the _Patrie_ has recently visited the battlefield,\r\nand obtained from this interesting old character, now Mme. Dupuis, some\r\nreminiscences of much that happened that day. She says:—\r\n\r\n“As a little girl, stirred and fascinated by the long lines of horsemen,\r\nguns, and tired foot regiments passing our cottage, I stood at our door\r\nand served out water to the ‘beaux soldats.’ Afterwards I followed them\r\nto Waterloo. In the evening we heard the booming of great cannon, and\r\nfrom the windows I could see the clouds of smoke rising into the air\r\nlike trees. I was in the mill, and the windows rattled. All night long\r\nwe heard the tramp of silent men and the creaking, stumbling guns\r\npassing our doors. When I looked out next morning I saw wounded men\r\nlying by the roadside. In the distance I could hear a sound like a rough\r\nsea breaking against the rocks. There were clouds of smoke, and I saw\r\nmen galloping, and masses of my brave soldiers moving hurriedly across\r\nthe fields. Then the doctors came, and took out the bullets from the\r\nwounds of the soldiers.... The Prussians came by, and then the English,\r\nshouting their cries of victory.\r\n\r\n“Not far away soldiers were digging trenches in our fields to bury the\r\ndead. There were so many of them, so many of them”—and the old peasant\r\ncovered her face with her hands as though to shut out the terrible\r\npicture. “I saw one woman of Gotarville cut off the fingers of a\r\nPrussian officer, sorely hurt but still living, to secure the jewelled\r\nrings that he wore.\r\n\r\n“At Planchenoit, a little further away, they tell me that the brave\r\nFrench were so beaten down by bayonet charges that the river ran with\r\nblood. Near the hill above a general was killed.\r\n\r\n“No; I did not see Napoleon, and I still regret it. Poor Napoleon!... We\r\ndid not like the English or the Prussians.... The next day we knew that\r\nNapoleon’s power was broken, by the lines we heard the people\r\nsinging,”—and raising herself in her chair, the tottering old dame sang\r\nin a feeble voice:—\r\n\r\n         Les cannoniers bombardaient à feu et à flamme,\r\n         Les cuirassiers, les gardes d’honneur, sont renversés,\r\n         Bonaparte, enfin voilà ta fin. Il faut te rendre—\r\n         Te voilà battu, convaincu, tu n’en peux plus!\r\n\r\n                                                    _Pall Mall Gazette._\r\n\r\n18th June, 1904.\r\n\r\n                    INDEX TO COMMISSIONED OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n Abercromby, Hon.
