My alterations have\r\nbeen concerned chiefly in bringing the volume up to date, a necessity\r\nimposed by the creation of new orders of knighthood, and change of\r\nSovereign. I have certainly omitted a few remarks which I have thought\r\nmight be the cause of leading students of the science astray: I have\r\naltered ambiguous wording to emphasise the real, and I have no doubt the\r\noriginally intended meaning. But in many points which, being deductions,\r\nare naturally matters of opinion, I have left herein various expressions\r\nof Mr. Boutell's opinion, with which I can hardly say I personally\r\naltogether agree or would myself put forward. I hold that it is no part\r\nof an editor's duty to air his own opinions under the protection or\r\nrepute of another's name, and herein I have inserted nothing for which\r\nmy own opinion is the only authority.\r\n\r\n  A. C. FOX-DAVIES.\r\n\r\n  LINCOLN'S INN, _June 1908_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 2.--St. Edward.\r\n  No. 1.--St. George.\r\n  No. 3.--St. Edmund.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Volume, specially prepared for the use of students at an early\r\nperiod of their study of English Heraldry, commends itself also to those\r\ninquirers who may desire to obtain some general information on the same\r\nsubject, without having any intention to devote to Heraldry much either\r\nof their time or of their serious regard.\r\n\r\nThe success, no less extraordinary than gratifying, of my larger work on\r\nHeraldry, led me to hope that a not less favourable reception might be\r\nextended to a simpler and much shorter essay, more decidedly elementary\r\nin its aim and character, and yet as far as possible within its limits\r\ncomplete. Such a treatise I have endeavoured to produce in this Volume.\r\n\r\nInseparably associated with the History of our Country, and more\r\nparticularly when our national History becomes the Biography of eminent\r\nEnglishmen, English Heraldry has the strongest claims upon the attention\r\nnot only of all Historians, but also of all who desire to become\r\nfamiliar with their writings. In like manner, Heraldry may be studied\r\nwith no less of advantage than of satisfaction by all Artists, whether\r\nArchitects, Sculptors, Painters, or Engravers. Nor is it too much to\r\nassert that some knowledge of Heraldry, in consequence of its singular\r\nand comprehensive utility, ought to be estimated as a necessary element\r\nof a liberal education. In confirmation of my own views, I am tempted to\r\nquote the following passage from M. GOURDON DE GENOUILLAC'S introduction\r\nto his excellent \"Grammaire Héraldique,\" published at Paris:-- \"Le\r\nblason,\" says M. de Genouillac, \"est une langue qui s'est conservée dans\r\nsa pureté primitive depuis les siècles, langue dont la connaissance, est\r\nindispensable aux familles nobles, qui y trouvent un signe d'alliance ou\r\nde reconnaissance, aux numismates, aux antiquaires, aux archéologues,\r\nenfin à tous les artistes, gens de lettres, &c.; cependant cette langue\r\nest presque inconnue, et la plupart des personnes qui possedent le droit\r\nde porter des armoiries seraient fort en peine de les expliquer selon\r\nles termes techniques!\" Heraldry, indeed, I believe to be a study worthy\r\nto be universally regarded with affectionate respect, as it certainly is\r\neminently qualified to inspire such a sentiment in every class of\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\nIn this spirit I have here treated the elements of the Heraldry of\r\nEngland, confident that, of those who may accompany me as far as I shall\r\nlead them, very many will not be content to stop where I shall take\r\nleave of them. Thus much I promise my companions--I will be to them a\r\nfaithful guide. They may trust to my accuracy. I have made no statement,\r\nhave adduced no example, nor have I exhibited any illustration, except\r\nupon authority. I myself like and admire what is real and true in\r\nHeraldry; and it is by the attractiveness of truth and reality that I\r\ndesire to win for Heraldry fresh friends, and to secure for it firm\r\nfriendships.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that from the authority, the practice, and the\r\nassociations of the early Heraldry of the best and most artistic eras,\r\nI seek to derive a Heraldry which we may rightly consider to be our own,\r\nand which we may transmit with honour to our successors. I do not\r\nsuggest the adoption, for present use, of an obsolete system. But, while\r\nI earnestly repudiate the acceptance and the maintenance amongst\r\nourselves of a most degenerate substitute for a noble Science, I do\r\naspire to aid in restoring HERALDRY to its becoming rank, and\r\nconsequently to its early popularity, now in our own times. This is to\r\nrevive the fine old Heraldry of the past, to give to it a fresh\r\nanimation, and to apply it under existing conditions to existing uses\r\nand requirements: not, to adjust ourselves to the circumstances of its\r\nfirst development, and to reproduce as copyists its original\r\nexpressions. It is not by any means a necessary condition of a\r\nconsistent revival of early Heraldry, that our revived Heraldry should\r\nadmit no deviation from original usage or precedent. So long as we are\r\nthoroughly animated by the spirit of the early Heralds, we may lead our\r\nHeraldry onwards with the advance of time. It is for us, indeed, to\r\nprepare a Heraldry for the future, no less than to revive true Heraldry\r\nin the time now present. We may rightly modify, therefore, and adapt\r\nmany things, in order to establish a true conformity between our\r\nHeraldry and the circumstances of our own era: for example, with\r\nadvantage as well as propriety we may, in a great measure, substitute\r\nBadges for Crests; and we shall do well to adopt a style of drawing\r\nwhich will be perfectly heraldic, without being positively unnatural.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of my Illustrations have been engraved only in\r\noutline, with the twofold object of my being thus enabled to increase\r\nthe number of the examples, and to adapt the engravings themselves to\r\nthe reception of colour. It will be very desirable for students to\r\nblazon the illustrations, or the majority of them, in their proper\r\ntinctures: and those who are thoroughly in earnest will not fail to form\r\ntheir own collections of additional examples, which, as a matter of\r\ncourse, they will seek to obtain from original authorities. With the\r\nexception of a few examples, my Illustrations, considerably over 400,\r\nhave all been executed expressly for this work; and they all have been\r\nengraved by Mr. R. B. UTTING. The chief exceptions are thirteen\r\nadmirable woodcuts of Scottish Seals, all of them good illustrations of\r\nHeraldry south of the Tweed, originally engraved for Laing's noble\r\nquarto upon \"The Ancient Seals of Scotland,\" published in Edinburgh.\r\nScottish Heraldry, I must add, as in any particulars of law and practice\r\nit may differ from our Heraldry on this side of the Tweed, I have left\r\nin the able hands of the Heralds of the North: at the same time,\r\nhowever, the Heraldry of which I have been treating has so much that is\r\nequally at home on either side of \"the Border,\" that I have never\r\nhesitated to look for my examples and authorities to both the fair\r\nrealms which now form one Great Britain.\r\n\r\n  C.

Is it possible? not know the figures of Heraldry!\r\n  Of what could your father be thinking?\"\r\n    --ROB ROY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe sentiment unquestionably was his own which Sir Walter Scott made\r\ndelightful Di Vernon express when, with indignant surprise, she asked\r\nFrank Osbaldistone of what his father could have been thinking, that he\r\nhad been permitted to grow up without any knowledge of Heraldry. Sir\r\nWalter was right in his estimate of the high value of Heraldry as an\r\nelement of education: and, in professing herself a votaress of the\r\nHerald's \"gentle science,\" it was quite right in Di Vernon to suggest to\r\nother ladies that it would be well for them if Heraldry should find\r\nfavour in their eyes also. The age of Rob Roy, however, was far from\r\nbeing in harmony with heraldic associations: nor was the author of\r\n\"Waverley\" himself permitted to accomplish more, than to lead the way to\r\nthat revival of a popular sympathy with every expression of early Art,\r\nwhich now forms one of the most remarkable characteristics of our own\r\nera.\r\n\r\nIn the olden time, in England, the love of Heraldry, which was prevalent\r\namongst all classes, was based upon an intelligent appreciation of its\r\nworthiness. A part of the feudal system of the Middle Ages, and at once\r\nderived from the prevailing form of thought and feeling, and imparting\r\nto it a brilliant colouring peculiar to itself, Heraldry exercised a\r\npowerful influence upon the manners and habits of the people amongst\r\nwhom it was in use. By our early ancestors, accordingly, as Mr. Montagu\r\nhas so happily written, \"little given to study of any kind, a knowledge\r\nof Heraldry was considered indispensable:\" to them it was the \"outward\r\nsign of the spirit of chivalry, the index, also, to a lengthened\r\nchronicle of doughty deeds.\" And this Heraldry grew up, spontaneously\r\nand naturally, out of the circumstances and requirements of those times.\r\nIt came into existence, because it was needed for practical use; it was\r\naccepted and cherished, because it did much more than fulfil its avowed\r\npurpose. At first, simply useful to distinguish particular individuals,\r\nespecially in war and at the tournament, English Heraldry soon became\r\npopular; and then, with no less rapidity, it rose to high honour and\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nFrom the circumstance that it first found its special use in direct\r\nconnection with military equipments, knightly exercises, and the _mêlée_\r\nof actual battle, mediæval Heraldry has also been entitled ARMORY. Men\r\nwore the ensigns of Heraldry about their persons, embroidered upon the\r\ngarments that partially covered their armour,--and so they called them\r\n_Coats-of-Arms_: they bore these same ensigns on their shields,--and\r\nthey called them _Shields-of-Arms_: and in their Armorial Banners and\r\nPennons they again displayed the very same insignia, floating in the\r\nwind high above their heads, from the shafts of their lances.\r\n\r\nThe Heraldry or Armory of England, an honourable and honoured member of\r\nthe illustrious family of mediæval European Heraldry, may be defined as\r\na symbolical and pictorial language, in which figures, devices, and\r\ncolours are employed instead of letters. Each heraldic composition has\r\nits own definite and complete significance, conveyed through its direct\r\nconnection with some particular individual, family, dignity, or office.\r\nEvery such heraldic composition, also, is a true legal possession, held\r\nand maintained by an express right and title: and it is hereditary, like\r\nother real property, in accordance with certain laws and precedents of\r\ninheritance. But in this respect heraldic insignia are singular and\r\nunlike other property, inasmuch as it is a general rule that they cannot\r\nbe alienated, exchanged, or transferred otherwise than by inheritance or\r\nother lawful succession. Exceptions to this rule, when they are observed\r\noccasionally to have occurred, show clearly their own exceptional\r\ncharacter, and consequently they confirm the true authority of the rule\r\nitself. It will be understood, as a necessary quality of its hereditary\r\nnature, that the significance of an heraldic composition, while\r\n\"definite and complete\" in itself, admits of augmentation and expansion\r\nthrough its association with successive generations. Thus, the Royal\r\nShield of EDWARD III. is \"complete\" as the heraldic symbol of that great\r\nmonarch, and of the realm under his rule: and yet this same shield,\r\nequally \"complete\" (with one simple modification) as the heraldic symbol\r\nof each successive Sovereign till the death of ELIZABETH, has its\r\nsignificance infinitely augmented and expanded through its hereditary\r\nassociation with all the Sovereigns of the Houses of Plantagenet and\r\nTudor.\r\n\r\nUntil the concluding quarter of the twelfth century, the traces of the\r\nexistence of Heraldry are faint and few in number. Early in the\r\nthirteenth century the new science began to establish itself firmly\r\namongst our ancestors of that age; and it is certain that, as soon as\r\nits character and capabilities were in any degree understood aright, it\r\ngrew speedily into favour; so that in the reign of HENRY III. (A.D.\r\n1216-1272) Heraldry in England had confirmed its own claims to be\r\nregarded as a Science, by being in possession of a system, and a\r\nclassification of its own.\r\n\r\nThe Crusades, those extraordinary confederacies without a parallel in\r\nthe history of civilised nations, were themselves so thoroughly a matter\r\nof religious chivalry, that it was only an inevitable result of their\r\nexistence that they should give a powerful impulse to the establishment\r\nand development of Heraldry in its early days.\r\n\r\nBut Heraldry, from the time of its first appearance in England, was\r\nfound to be valuable for other uses besides those which so intimately\r\nconnected it with both real and imitative warfare, with the fierce\r\nlife-and-death conflict of the battle-field, and with the scarcely less\r\nperilous struggle for honour and renown in the lists. Very soon after\r\nthe Norman Conquest, in consequence of their presence being required to\r\ngive validity to every species of legal document, SEALS became\r\ninstruments of the greatest importance; and it was soon obvious that\r\nheraldic insignia, with a representation of the knightly shield upon\r\nwhich they were displayed, were exactly suited to satisfy every\r\nrequirement of the seal-engraver. By such means Heraldry became\r\ninterwoven as well with the peaceful concerns of everyday life, as with\r\nthe display of martial splendour and the turmoil of war.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to set aside the opinion that the Heraldry\r\nof the Middle Ages in England was a fresh creation, a production of\r\nindigenous growth: and great is the ingenuity that has been brought into\r\naction to carry back the Heraldry of our own country from the\r\ncommencement of the thirteenth century through the previous elementary\r\nstages of its existence, in order to trace its direct lineal descent\r\nfrom certain decorative and symbolical devices that were in use at much\r\nearlier periods. The careful and diligent researches, however, of the\r\nmost learned Heralds have at present led them almost unanimously to\r\nreject all such theories as these, as speculative and uncertain. At the\r\nsame time, it is an indisputable fact that, in all ages of the world,\r\nand amongst all races of men, some form of symbolical expression has\r\nbeen both in use and in favour. And it is equally true that this\r\nsymbolism, whatever it may have been, has generally been found in some\r\nway associated with a military life and with the act of warfare.\r\nSoldiers, and particularly those in high command, have always delighted\r\nto adorn their shields with devices that sometimes were significant of\r\ntheir own condition or exploits, or sometimes had reference to their\r\ncountry, or even to their families; and, in like manner, it has been a\r\nuniversal custom to display similar devices and figures in military\r\nstandards of all kinds. At the time of the Conquest, as is shown in the\r\nfamous Bayeux Tapestry of the Conqueror's Consort, the shields and\r\nstandards of both Normans and Anglo-Saxons were painted, and perhaps the\r\nlatter were embroidered, with various figures and devices; but certainly\r\nwithout any heraldic significance or any personal associations being\r\nindicated by these figures and devices, which bear a general resemblance\r\nto the insignia of the Legions and Cohorts of Imperial Rome. Figures\r\nNos. 5 and 6 give representations of the standards that are introduced\r\ninto the Bayeux Tapestry. The same species of decoration, consisting\r\nchiefly of painted patterns, with discs, stars, crescents, and some\r\nother figures, continued in use in our own country until superseded by a\r\ntrue Heraldry; and may also be assumed to have prevailed in England in\r\nmuch earlier times.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Nos. 5 and 6.--Lance Flags--Bayeux Tapestry.]\r\n\r\nIn still more remote ages a more decided heraldic system was displayed\r\nupon signets, coins, shields, and standards. In this ancient Heraldry,\r\nif so it may be termed, occasionally the important and characteristic\r\nquality of hereditary association in certain devices is apparent. Thus,\r\nVirgil (Æneid, vii. 657) assigns to Aventinus \"_insigne paternum_\" upon\r\nhis shield--his hereditary device, derived by him from his father. But\r\nthese devices generally appear to have their significance in a greater\r\nor a less degree restricted, amongst the ancients, to certain particular\r\nincidents; consequently in all these examples there is nothing to show\r\nthat the man who bore one device at one time, did not bear another\r\ndevice at another time.[1] For example, Æschylus, the Greek tragedian\r\n(B.C. 600), has recorded that Capaneus, when attacking the city of\r\nThebes, bore on his shield the figure of a warrior carrying a lighted\r\ntorch, with the motto, \"I will fire the city!\" But, on another occasion,\r\nwe have reason to believe that the same Capaneus bore quite a different\r\ndevice, applicable to that other occasion; and this deprives these\r\nancient devices, heraldic as they are in their general character, of\r\nthat special personal association which true Heraldry requires and,\r\nindeed, implies. The beautiful painted vases, the works of Greek\r\nartists, that are discovered in such extraordinary numbers and in\r\nperfect preservation in some parts of Italy, constantly give most\r\nstriking representations of the shields of ancient Greek warriors and\r\nother personages, with what appear heraldic devices displayed upon them.\r\nThese shields illustrate, in a remarkable manner, both the appropriate\r\nsignificance of particular devices, and the usage then prevalent for a\r\nvariety of devices to be borne on different occasions by the same\r\nindividual. Shields upon vases in the collections in the Museum of the\r\nLouvre at Paris, and in the British Museum, where they are easy of\r\naccess, contain a great variety of devices. The examples, Nos. 7, 8, 9,\r\nand 10, are from our own National Collections. No. 7, the shield black,\r\nthe border and the pegasus red; No. 8, the shield black, and the two\r\ndolphins white; No. 9, the shield black, with a border adorned with red\r\ndiscs, the serpent white; No. 10, the shield black, with purple border,\r\nthe three human legs conjoined white. The shields, Nos. 9 and 10, are\r\nboth borne by the goddess +ATHÊNÊ+ (Minerva); and the remarkable device\r\ndisplayed on No. 10 is also found on the coins of ancient Sicily. Other\r\nsimilar shields display lions, horses, dogs, wild boars, fish, birds,\r\nclusters of leaves, chariots and chariot-wheels, votive tripods,\r\nserpents, scorpions, with many others, including occasional examples\r\nof human figures. In another collection I have seen an anchor and an\r\nAmazon's bow. A device differing from that in No. 10 only in having the\r\nconjoined limbs in armour, will be found in our own English Heraldry to\r\nbe the armorial ensign of the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: In his \"Hand-book of Engraved Gems,\" Mr. King maintains\r\n    that \"the devices on the signets of the ancients were both\r\n    hereditary and unalterable, like our armorial bearings;\" but, at the\r\n    same time, he admits that the \"armorial bearings,\" which appear \"on\r\n    the shields of the Grecian heroes in the most ancient pictures\r\n    extant, the Vase-paintings,\" \"seem to have been assumed at the\r\n    caprice of the individual, like the knight's _cognisances_ at\r\n    tournaments in the days of chivalry, and not to have been\r\n    hereditary.\" --\"Hand-book,\" page 216. Almost immediately, however,\r\n    Mr. King adds, that traditions exist which represent the mythic\r\n    heroes bearing \"engraved on their signets the same devices that\r\n    decorated their shields.\" It would seem that the argument from such\r\n    traditions would rather indicate the signet-devices to have been\r\n    arbitrary, than the shield-devices to have been unalterable. While I\r\n    readily admit the very interesting devices of antiquity to possess\r\n    decided heraldic attributes, I cannot consider Mr. King to have\r\n    shown that, as a general rule, they were held by the ancients\r\n    themselves to have been either \"unalterable\" or \"hereditary.\"\r\n    Possibly, further light may be thrown upon the hereditary quality of\r\n    ancient Heraldry: but, I certainly do not expect to see any evidence\r\n    adduced, which would establish a line of descent connecting the\r\n    Mediæval Heraldry of England with any heraldic system of classic\r\n    antiquity.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Nos. 7-10.--Ancient Shields from Greek Vases.]\r\n\r\nThis Heraldry of Antiquity is to be regarded as the predecessor, and not\r\nas the ancestor of the Heraldry of England. There may be much that is\r\ncommon to both; but, there is nothing to show the later system to have\r\nbeen a lineal descendant from the earlier. It would seem much more\r\nlikely that Heraldry, when it had been evolved, adopted ready made the\r\nemblems of an older civilisation for its own purpose, often\r\nappropriating at the same time the symbolism attaching to the emblems.\r\nThe Heraldry, therefore, that has flourished, declined, and now is in\r\nthe act of reviving in our own country in almost the full vigour of its\r\nbest days, I shall treat as an independent science, proceeding from a\r\nsingle source, and from thence flowing onwards with varied fortunes,\r\nside by side with the chequered chronicles of England. In the course of\r\nits progress from the palmy days of EDWARD III., it has had to\r\nencounter, in a degree without precedent or parallel, that most painful\r\nand mischievous of trials--the excessive admiration of injudicious\r\nfriends. Hence, Heraldry was brought into disrepute, and even into\r\ncontempt, by the very persons who loved it with a genuine but a most\r\nunwise love. In process of time, no nonsense appeared too extravagant,\r\nand no fable too wild, to be engrafted upon the grave dignity of the\r\nHerald's early science. Better times at length have succeeded. Heraldry\r\nnow has friends and admirers, zealous as of old, whose zeal is guided\r\naright by a sound judgment in alliance with a pure taste. Very much\r\nalready has been accomplished to sweep away the amazing mass of\r\nabsurdities and errors which had overwhelmed our English Heraldry, by\r\nsuch men as Nicholas, Nichols, Courthope, Seton, Planché, Walford,\r\nMontagu, and Lower: and the good work goes on and prospers, with the\r\nmost cheering assurances of complete and triumphant success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEARLY HERALDIC AUTHORITIES\r\n\r\n  _Seals: Monumental Effigies, &c.: Rolls of Arms, Official Heraldic\r\n  Records, &c.-- Earliest Heraldic Shields and Banners-- Allusive\r\n  Quality of Early Armory-- Attributed Arms._\r\n\r\n  \"Let us begin at the beginning.\"\r\n    --PURSUIVANT OF ARMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the head of the earliest existing authorities in English Heraldry are\r\nSEALS. To the fortunate circumstance of the legal importance attached to\r\nthem we are indebted for the preservation of these equally interesting\r\nand valuable relics, in great variety and in very considerable numbers.\r\nThe heraldic evidence of Seals is necessarily of the highest order. They\r\nare original works, possessing contemporaneous authority. Produced with\r\npeculiar care and approved by their first possessors, their original\r\nauthenticity is confirmed by their continued use through successive\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nHaving been in use before the introduction and adoption of Heraldry in\r\nEngland, Seals enable us to compare the devices that preceded true\r\nHeraldry with the earliest that are truly heraldic: and thus they show\r\nthat, in many instances, regular coats-of-arms were derived in their\r\nhereditary bearings from similar devices that had been adopted in the\r\nsame families before the heraldic era. For example: the Seal of John\r\nMundegumri, about A.D. 1175, bears a _single fleur-de-lys_, not placed\r\nupon a shield; and, accordingly, here is seen the origin of the _three\r\ngolden fleurs-de-lys_, borne afterwards upon a blue shield by the\r\ndescendants of this John, the Montgomeries, Earls of Eglintoun. Again:\r\nthe Seal of Walter Innes, A.D. 1431, displays the shield of arms of his\r\nhouse--_three blue mullets_ (stars generally of five rays) on a field of\r\nsilver, No. 11; and these mullets may be traced to the _single star_,\r\nthat appears on the Seal of William Innes, or De Ynays, No. 12, appended\r\nto his deed of homage to Edward I., in the year 1295. I have selected\r\nthese examples from the \"Catalogue of Scottish Seals,\" published by Mr.\r\nLaing, of Edinburgh, that I may be enabled here to refer in the highest\r\nterms of admiring commendation to that most excellent work. It is\r\ngreatly to be desired that a corresponding publication should treat,\r\nwith equal ability, of the Seals of England which, from the dawn of\r\nHeraldry, continue their admirable examples and illustrations throughout\r\nits career.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 11.--Seal of Walter Innes.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 12.--Seal of Wm. Innes.]\r\n\r\nMonumental Effigies, Sepulchral Memorials, early Buildings, and early\r\nStained Glass, frequently are rich in authoritative examples of \"the\r\nfigures of Heraldry.\" In addition to the various forms and combinations\r\nof heraldic composition, these works illustrate the early style of\r\ndrawing in favour with Heralds during the great eras of mediæval Art,\r\nand they have preserved to us most useful and suggestive representations\r\nof various devices in their proper heraldic aspect. In many instances\r\nthe Heraldry of early Monuments and Architecture possesses a peculiar\r\nvalue, arising from the circumstance of the shields of arms and other\r\ninsignia having been sculptured in low relief or outlined in incised\r\nlines, and consequently these devices and compositions retain their\r\noriginal forms: and, in like manner, the original colouring of the\r\nHeraldry of Stained Glass remains safe from restoration or destruction,\r\nin consequence of the impossibility of re-painting it.\r\n\r\nThe early written Literature of English Heraldry is calculated to throw\r\nbut little light upon either its true character or its history. In\r\naddition, however, to the various and numerous official documents of the\r\nHeralds' College, several examples of one particular class of heraldic\r\nrecord have been preserved, the value of which cannot be too highly\r\nestimated. These are ROLLS OF ARMS--long, narrow strips of parchment, on\r\nwhich are written lists of the names and titles of certain personages,\r\nwith full descriptions of their armorial insignia. The circumstances\r\nunder which these Rolls were prepared are obviously not identical and\r\nfor the most part unknown: but, the exact accuracy of their statements\r\nhas been established beyond all question by careful and repeated\r\ncomparison with Seals and other Monuments, and also with Documents which\r\ngive only an indirect and yet not the less conclusive corroboration to\r\nthe records of the Rolls of Arms themselves. The earliest of these Rolls\r\nat present known date about A.D. 1240 to 1245; and since in these\r\nearliest Rolls a very decided technical language is uniformly adopted,\r\nand the descriptions are all given in palpable accordance with fixed\r\nrules which must then have been well understood, we infer that by the\r\nend of the first half of the thirteenth century there was in existence a\r\nsystem for the regulation of such matters. Heraldry was perhaps\r\nrecognised as a Science, with fixed terms and rules for describing\r\nheraldic devices and figures, and established laws to direct the\r\ngranting, the assuming, and the bearing of arms.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of these early heraldic Rolls records, in a\r\nmetrical form, and in Norman-French, the siege and capture of the\r\nfortress of Carlaverock, on the Scottish border, by EDWARD I., in the\r\nyear 1300. In addition to very curious descriptions of the muster of the\r\nRoyal troops at Carlisle, their march northwards, and the incidents of\r\nthe siege (which last have a strange resemblance to what Homer has\r\nrecorded of incidents that took place during the siege of Troy), this\r\nRoll gives some graphic personal sketches of the princes, nobles,\r\nbannerets, and knights, whose banners and shields of arms are set forth\r\nin it with minute exactness. This Roll, as well as several others, has\r\nbeen published, with translations and very valuable notes.\r\n\r\nIn the Manuscript Collections of the British Museum also, and of other\r\nLibraries both public and private, and in the County Histories, and\r\nother works of a cognate character, there are many documents which\r\ncontain various important records and illustrations of early English\r\nHeraldry.\r\n\r\nIn any references to authorities, that it may appear desirable for me to\r\nmake in the course of this and the following chapters, I must be as\r\nconcise as possible. A direct reference to Seals, Effigies, &c., will be\r\nnecessary in each case: but, in referring to Rolls of Arms, it will be\r\nsufficient to denote the period of the authority in general terms.\r\nAccordingly, I shall refer, not to each particular Roll, but\r\ncollectively to those of each of the following reigns--HENRY III.,\r\nEDWARD I., EDWARD II., EDWARD III., and RICHARD II.; and these\r\nreferences will severally be made thus,--(H. 3), (E. 1), (E. 2), (E. 3),\r\nand (R. 2).\r\n\r\nAmongst the earliest Shields and Banners of Arms, all of them remarkable\r\nfor their simplicity, many are found to be without any device whatever,\r\ntheir distinction consisting simply in some peculiarity in the\r\ncolouring. Such examples may be considered to have been derived from\r\npre-heraldic times, and transmitted, without any change or addition, to\r\nlater periods. The renowned Banner of the Knights Templars, by them\r\ncalled _Beauseant_, No. 13, is black above and white below, which is\r\nsaid to have denoted that, while fierce to their foes, they were\r\ngracious to their friends. An ancient Banner of the Earl of Leicester\r\n(H. 3) is white and red, the division being made by a vertical indented\r\nline; No. 14. This design, however, was not the coat of arms of the\r\nearl. The Shield of the ducal House of Brittany, closely connected with\r\nthe Royal Family of England, is simply of the fur ermine; No. 15. The\r\nShield of Waldegrave is silver and red, as in No. 16: and that of Fitz\r\nWarine (H. 3), also of silver and red, is treated as in No. 17.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 13.--Banner of Templars.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 14.--Banner of Leicester.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 15.--Brittany.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 16.--Waldegrave.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 17.--Fitz Warine.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 18.--Shield at Whitworth.]\r\n\r\nSome of the earliest of the simple devices of true Heraldry were\r\nevidently adopted from the _structural formation_ (or from a _structural\r\nstrengthening_) of the Shields, on which they were displayed. Thus,\r\na raised border, and bands of metal variously disposed in order to\r\nimpart additional strength to a shield, with distinct colouring, would\r\nproduce a series of heraldic compositions. A good example occurs in the\r\nshield of an early Effigy at Whitworth, Durham, No. 18, in which the\r\nheads of the rivets or screws employed to fix the border on the shield,\r\nappear to have been made to assume the character of heraldic additions\r\nto the simple border and horizontal bands. Other primary devices of the\r\nsame simple order, which in like manner may have had a structural\r\norigin, I shall consider in detail in subsequent chapters. (See\r\nparticularly Chapter VI.)\r\n\r\nThe central boss, at once an appropriate ornament of an early shield,\r\nand an important addition to its defensive qualities, when extended in\r\nthe form of decorative metal-work, would readily suggest a variety of\r\nheraldic figures, and amongst others several beautiful modifications of\r\na simple cruciform device which it might be made to assume. The figure\r\ncalled an escarbuncle, No. 19, is simply a shield-boss developed into\r\ndecorative structural metal-work. This figure appears in the Temple\r\nChurch, London, upon the shield of an Effigy, which Mr. J. Gough Nichols\r\nhas shown to have been incorrectly attributed to Geoffrey de Mandeville,\r\nEarl of Essex.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 19.--The Escarbuncle.]\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the earliest devices that appear in English\r\nHeraldry were adopted for the express purpose of their having some\r\n_allusive association_, through a similarity of sound in their own names\r\nor descriptions with the names and titles or the territories of certain\r\npersons, dignities, and places. In exact accordance with the principles\r\nand aim of primitive mediæval Heraldry, and in perfect harmony with the\r\nsentiments and requirements of the age in which it grew up into a\r\nscience, devices of this kind addressed themselves in very plain and\r\nexpressive language to the men of their own era. In them they saw the\r\nkind of symbolical writing that they could remember, as well as\r\nunderstand. They also evidently liked the quaint style of suggestiveness\r\nthat was a characteristic of these allusive devices: and, it is more\r\nthan probable that there frequently lurked in them a humorous\r\nsignificance, which by no means tended to detract from their popularity.\r\nDevices of this same order have never ceased to be in favour with\r\nHeralds and lovers of Heraldry. They were used in the sixteenth century\r\nat least as commonly as in the thirteenth; but, as would be expected, in\r\nthe later period they often became complicated, far-fetched, and\r\nextravagant.\r\n\r\nThis allusive quality, distinguished in English Heraldry as \"_canting_,\"\r\nhas commonly been misunderstood, and therefore incorrectly estimated, by\r\nmodern writers, who have supposed it to be a fantastic conceit of the\r\nHeralds of a degenerate age. By writers such as these, accordingly, all\r\n\"_canting arms_\" (by French Heralds called \"_armes parlantes_\") have\r\nbeen absurdly assigned to a separate class, in their estimation having\r\nan inferior heraldic grade.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of the allusive quality in early arms may be assumed to\r\nhave been even more general than is now apparent, since so many of the\r\noriginal echoes and allusions have become obscured or altogether lost in\r\nthe lapse of time, and through the changes that have taken place since\r\nthe accession of HENRY III. in the French language and in our own also.\r\nThe use of the Latin language, again, in the Middle Ages led, at later\r\nperiods, to translations of names; French names, too, were translated in\r\nthe same manner into English equivalents: and, at other times, the sound\r\nof a Latin or a French (Anglo-Norman) name was transferred to an English\r\nrepresentative having a somewhat similar sound, without the slightest\r\nreference to the original signification. Who, for example, in the name\r\nof MONTAGU now recognises instinctively the original allusion to a\r\n_mountain_ with its _sharply_ peaked crests, and so discerns the\r\nprobable allusive origin of the _sharp_ triple points of the devices on\r\nthe old Montacute shield, No. 20? It is easy to see how much must have\r\nbeen unconsciously done, by such changes in names and their\r\nassociations, to obliterate what once was clear, significant, and\r\nexpressive. I must be content here to give, simply by way of explanatory\r\nillustration, a very few examples of allusive arms; and, in so doing, it\r\nmay be well for me to observe that the early Heralds of our country\r\nalways employed the French language as it was spoken in their own times\r\nin England as well as in France. In the time of HENRY III., G. de Lucy\r\nhas for his arms _three lucies_--fish now known as pike: Robert Quency\r\nhas a _quintefueil_--a flower of five leaves: Thos. Corbett has _two\r\ncorbeaux_--ravens: A. de Swyneburne has \"_trois testes de\r\nsenglier_\"--three heads of the wild boar, or _swine_: (E. 2), Sir R. de\r\nEschales has _six escallops_--_shells_: Sir G. de Trompintoun, of\r\nTrumpington, near Cambridge, has _two trompes_--trumpets: Sir J. Bordoun\r\nhas _three bourdons_--pilgrim's staves: Sir G. Rossel has _three roses_:\r\nand Sir O. Heron has the same number of _herons_. So also, for the\r\nSpanish provinces Castile and Leon, a _castle_ and a _lion_: for\r\nFalconer, a _falcon_: Butler, _cups_: Forester, _bugle-horns_: Arundel,\r\n_hirondelles_--swallows: Wingfield, _wings_: Shelley, _shells_: Pigot,\r\n_pick-axes_: Leveson, _leaves_: and Martel, _martels_--hammers. The\r\n_Broom-plant_ with its seed-pods, in Latin _Planta genista_, No. 21,\r\ngave its name to the PLANTAGENET Dynasty. I shall hereafter add several\r\nother curious examples of devices of this class, when treating of\r\n_Badges_, _Rebuses_, and _Mottoes_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 20.--Shield of Montacute.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 21.--Planta Genista.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 22.--WILLIAM I.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 23.--Saxon Princes.]\r\n\r\nThere is one class of early arms, which it is important that students of\r\nArmory should observe with especial care, lest they be led by them into\r\nunexpected errors. These are arms that were invented _after_ Heraldry\r\nhad been established, and then were assigned to personages of historical\r\neminence who had lived and died _before_ the true heraldic era. In the\r\ndays in which every person of prominence bore heraldic arms, and when\r\nHeraldry had attained to high renown, it was natural enough to consider\r\nthat suitable armorial devices and compositions should be assigned to\r\nthe men of mark in earlier ages, both to distinguish them in accordance\r\nwith the usage then prevalent, and to treat their memory with becoming\r\nhonour. Such arms were also in a sense necessary to their descendants\r\nfor the purposes of quartering. No proof can be shown that the arms said\r\nto have been borne by WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR are not of this order--made\r\nfor him, that is, and attributed to him in after times, but of which he\r\nhimself had no knowledge. These arms, No. 22, differ from the true Royal\r\nInsignia of England only in there being _two_, instead of _three_, lions\r\ndisplayed upon the shield. The arms of EDWARD THE CONFESSOR, No. 2, were\r\ncertainly devised long after his death, and they appear to have been\r\nsuggested to the heralds of HENRY III. by one of the Confessor's coins:\r\nthe shield is blue, and the cross and five birds (martlets) are gold. In\r\nlike manner, the arms attributed to the earlier Saxon Sovereigns of\r\nEngland, No. 23, a gold cross upon blue, are really not earlier than the\r\nthirteenth century. The arms, No. 2, having been assigned to ST. EDWARD,\r\na patron saint of mediæval England, were long regarded with peculiar\r\nreverence. I have placed them, drawn from a fine shield of the\r\nthirteenth century in Westminster Abbey, to take a part in forming a\r\ngroup at the head of my Preface, with the shields of the two other\r\nsaintly Patrons of \"old England,\" ST. GEORGE and ST. EDMUND, No. 1 and\r\nNo. 3--a red cross on a silver shield, and three golden crowns upon a\r\nshield of blue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n  _The English Heraldry that is now in existence-- First Debasement\r\n  of Heraldry-- Later Debasement-- Revival of English Heraldry--\r\n  Heraldic Art._\r\n\r\n  \"Sans changer.\"\r\n    --MOTTO OF STANLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish Heraldry, as it exists amongst us in our own times, is the very\r\nsame Heraldry that flourished under the kindly influences of the\r\ngreatest of the Plantagenets, though perhaps modified in some details by\r\nchanged circumstances. It is not of a new, but of the old, Heraldry of\r\nEngland that I am setting forth the elements. Our Heraldry has had to\r\npass from good days to bad ones: and, having gone through the worst of\r\nbad days, the circle at length has revolved, so that we are witnessing\r\nthe happy change of a vigorous heraldic revival. Heraldry already enjoys\r\na very great popularity; and, without a doubt, it will become still more\r\npopular, in the degree that it is better and more generally understood.\r\nFor its complete ultimate success, the present revival of true English\r\nHeraldry must mainly depend upon the manner in which we apply the\r\nlessons that may be learned by us, no less from the warnings of the\r\nrecent evil days of the science, than from the example of the brilliant\r\nones that preceded them long ago. Nor should we deal faithfully with our\r\nrevived Heraldry, were we not to form a just estimate of whatever was\r\nimperfect in the best era of its early history, in order to apply to\r\npresent improvement the lessons that thus also may be learned. It must\r\nbe admitted that the Heralds and Heraldic writers of the 17th century,\r\nfollowing the footsteps of some of their immediate predecessors, led the\r\nway towards the thorough debasement of their own science. Their example\r\nwas not without effect upon those who followed them--men quite equal to\r\nthe perpetration of whatever had not been already done to bring Heraldry\r\ninto contempt. This was accomplished first, by gravely discoursing, in\r\nearly heraldic language, upon the imaginary Heraldry of the patriarchal\r\nand antediluvian worthies: making a true coat of arms of Joseph's \"coat\r\nof many colours,\" giving armorial ensigns to David and Gideon, to Samson\r\nand Joshua, to \"that worthy gentilman Japheth,\" to Jubal and Tubal-Cain,\r\nand crowning the whole by declaring that our common progenitor, Adam,\r\nbore on his own red shield Eve's shield of silver, after the mediæval\r\nfashion that would denote his wife to have been an heiress!\r\n\r\nThen there set in a flood of allegorical and fantastic absurdities, by\r\nwhich the fair domain of Heraldry was absolutely overwhelmed. Wild and\r\nstrange speculations, in a truly vain philosophy, interwoven with\r\ndistorted images of both the myths and the veritable records of classic\r\nantiquity, were either deduced from armorial blazonry, or set forth as\r\nthe sources from whence it was developed. Fables and anecdotes, having\r\nreference to less remote eras, were produced in great variety and in\r\ncopious abundance. The presence in blazon of animated beings of\r\nwhatsoever kinds, whether real or fabulous, led to rambling\r\ndisquisitions in the most ludicrously _un_natural of imaginary Natural\r\nHistory. From every variety also of inanimate figure and device, the\r\nsimplest no less than the more elaborate, after the same fashion some\r\n\"moral\" was sought to be extracted. The technical language, too, of the\r\nearly Heralds, had its expressive simplicity travestied by a complicated\r\njargon, replete with marvellous assertions, absurd doctrines, covert\r\nallusions devoid of consistent significance, quaint and yet trivial\r\nconceits, and bombastic rhapsodies. Even the nomenclature of the\r\nTinctures was not exempt from a characteristic course of \"treatment,\"\r\ntwo distinctive additional sets of titles for gold, silver, blue, red,\r\n&c., having been devised and substituted for those in general use (see\r\nChapter V.); of these the one set was derived from the names of the\r\n_Planets_, and employed to emblazon the insignia of Sovereign Princes;\r\nand the other set, derived from the names of _Jewels_, was applied to\r\nthe arms of Nobles. In the midst of all the rubbish, however, which they\r\nthus delighted to accumulate, there may generally be discovered in the\r\nworks of writers of this class, here and there, references to earlier\r\nusages and illustrations of original principles which, in the extreme\r\ndearth of genuine early heraldic literature, are both interesting and of\r\nreal value. Nor are these writings without their value, estimated from\r\nanother point of view, as contemporaneous and unconscious commentaries\r\nupon the history of their own times. It must be added that, in more than\r\na few instances, beneath the surface there lurks a vein of both\r\npolitical and personal allusion, of which the point and bearing now are\r\naltogether lost, or at the most are only open to conjecture and surmise.\r\nAnd, again, even in their most extravagant and frivolous lucubrations,\r\nthe heraldic writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are not\r\nwithout touches of humour; as when Gerard Legh (A.D. 1562), discoursing\r\nof \"beastes,\" remarks of the \"Ramme\" that in \"aucthoritye he is a Duke,\r\nfor hee hath the leadyng of multitudes and flockes of his own kynde;\"\r\nand of the ass, \"I could write much of this beaste, but that it might be\r\nthought it were to mine own glorie.\"\r\n\r\nThe adoption of additional quarterings for the purpose of display, and\r\nthe introduction of more complicated compositions in the time of\r\nHENRY VIII., were speedily followed by the substitution of pictorial\r\nrepresentations, often of a most frivolous and inconsistent character,\r\nand many of them altogether unintelligible without written explanations,\r\ninstead of the simple, dignified, and expressive insignia of true\r\nHeraldry. For example, in the year 1760, a grant of arms was made to a\r\nLincolnshire family named Tetlow, which, with thirteen other figures,\r\nincludes the representation of a book duly clasped and ornamented,\r\nhaving on it a silver penny; while above the book rests a dove, holding\r\nin its beak a crow-quill! This was to commemorate one of the family\r\nhaving, with a crow-quill, actually achieved the exploit of writing the\r\nLord's Prayer within the compass of a silver penny. Amongst the most\r\nobjectionable of the arms of this class are those which were granted to\r\ndistinguished naval and military officers--arms, that certainly ought to\r\nhave conferred fresh honour on illustrious names, instead of inflicting\r\ndishonour upon Heraldry itself. Battles by sea and land, landscapes and\r\nsea views and fortified cities, flags of all kinds, with medals and\r\nribbons, all of them intermixed with devices not quite so unheraldic,\r\nabound in these extravagant compositions. The arms of Lord Nelson, and\r\nstill more recently those of General Lord Gough, may be specified as\r\nflagrant examples of this degenerate pictorial Heraldry. The Duke of\r\nWellington happily escaped a similar infliction. It would be but too\r\neasy to enumerate other equally inconsistent and unheraldic\r\ncompositions: but, I must be content to refer only to the armorial\r\nshield granted to the great astronomer, Sir John Herschel, on which is\r\ndisplayed his forty-foot reflecting telescope, with all its apparatus!\r\nThese, and all such violations of heraldic truth and consistency, though\r\nin some instances they are of very recent date, are now to be assigned\r\nto a closed chapter in the history of English Heraldry. But in\r\nconsidering them it must not be forgotten that this kind of grant was\r\nnot confined to this country, but flourished to a still greater extent\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nIn our present revival of English Heraldry, it is essential that we\r\nimpress upon our minds a correct conception of the twofold character of\r\nall Heraldry--that it is a _Science_, and also that it is an _Art_. We\r\nhave to vindicate the reputation of our Heraldry, as well in the one\r\ncapacity as in the other. Of very noble heraldic Art we happily possess\r\noriginal examples in great numbers, which have been bequeathed to us, as\r\na precious inheritance, from \"the brave days of old.\" The style of Art\r\nthat we see exemplified in these early authorities we may accept almost\r\nunreservedly as our own style; and we must aspire to sympathise heartily\r\nwith their genuine heraldic feeling. In our representation, also, of\r\nalmost all inanimate and natural objects in our own armorial\r\ncompositions, as a general rule, we may trust confidently to the same\r\ngood guidance. The early method of representation, indeed, must form the\r\nbasis of our system of treatment; and, we may faithfully adhere to this\r\nrule, and yet occasionally we may find it to be desirable that the form\r\nand the accessories of some devices should be adapted to modern\r\nassociations. In truth, it is not by merely copying the works of even\r\nthe greatest of the early heraldic artists, that we are to become\r\nmasters in heraldic Art. When the copies are good, copying is always\r\nvaluable, as a branch of study; but, if it be our highest and only aim\r\nto reproduce the expressions of other men's thoughts, then copying is\r\nworse than worthless. What we have to do is to express our heraldic Art\r\nin the spirit of the early Heralds, to keep it in harmony with what, in\r\nthe best of the early days, they would have accepted as the highest\r\nheraldic Art, and at the same time to show that our heraldic Art in very\r\ntruth is our own.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 24.--Prince JOHN OF ELTHAM, A.D. 1336.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Nos. 25, 26.--Badge of RICHARD II., Westminster Hall.]\r\n\r\nThe treatment of animate creatures in Heraldry requires a certain kind,\r\nand also a certain degree, of conventionalism. Here, as before, in the\r\nearly Heralds we have excellent masters; but, here we must follow their\r\nteaching with more of reserve, and with cautious steps. We recognise the\r\nhappy consistency of the conventionalism which they displayed in their\r\nrepresentation of animate creatures, without any purpose to adopt it in\r\nthe same degree with them. Had the early Heralds been more familiar with\r\nthe living presence of the various creatures that they summoned to enter\r\ninto their service, without a doubt they would have represented them\r\nwith a much closer conformity to Nature. We must apply our better\r\nknowledge, as we may feel confident the early Heralds would have applied\r\na similar knowledge had they been able to have acquired it. Heraldic\r\nanimals of every kind--lions, eagles, dolphins, and all others--must be\r\nso far subjected to a conventional treatment, that they will not exhibit\r\na _strictly_ natural appearance: and, on the other hand, being carefully\r\npreserved from all exaggerated conventionalisms, they must approach as\r\nnear to Nature as a definite conventional rendering of natural truth\r\nwill admit. The lions of the early Heralds, spirited beasts always,\r\ngenerally show a decided disposition to exhibit their heraldic\r\nsympathies in excess. They have in them rather too much that is heraldic\r\nconventionalism, and not quite enough that is natural lion. And, with\r\nthe first symptoms of decline in heraldic Art, the treatment of lions\r\nshowed signs of a tendency to carry conventionalism to the utmost\r\nextravagance. The same remarks are applicable to eagles. It must be\r\nadded, however, that truly admirable examples of heraldic animals\r\noccasionally may be found as late even as the commencement of the\r\nsixteenth century, as in the chantry of Abbot Ramryge, in the Abbey\r\nChurch at St. Alban's, and in King's College Chapel at Cambridge. It\r\nmust be our care to blend together the true attributes of the living\r\nlion and eagle, and those also of other living creatures, with the\r\ntraditional peculiarities of their heraldic representatives. And we must\r\nextend the corresponding application of the same principles of treatment\r\nto imaginary beings and heraldic monsters, as they occur in our\r\nHeraldry. The shield, No. 24, of Prince JOHN OF ELTHAM, younger brother\r\nof EDWARD III., finely sculptured with his effigy in alabaster, in\r\nWestminster Abbey (A.D. 1336), and in perfect preservation, gives us\r\ncharacteristic examples of lions of the best heraldic era, their frames,\r\nattenuated as they are, being perfect types of fierce elasticity. With\r\nthis shield may be grouped others, having admirably suggestive examples\r\nof heraldic lions of a somewhat later date, which are preserved upon the\r\nmonuments of EDWARD III. and the BLACK PRINCE, severally at Westminster\r\nand Canterbury. I shall refer to these fine shields again, and to other\r\nadmirable examples with them, hereafter (Chapter IX.). The\r\nconventionalism in all these examples, however felicitous the manner in\r\nwhich it is treated in them, is very decidedly exaggerated. These\r\nexamples, and others such as these, are not the less valuable to us\r\nbecause their teaching includes an illustration of the excesses that we\r\nmust always be careful to avoid. I may here observe, that on the subject\r\nof armorial Art I leave my examples (all of them selected from the most\r\ncharacteristic authorities, and engraved with scrupulous fidelity) for\r\nthe most part to convey their own lessons and suggestions: my own\r\nsuggestion to students being that, in such living creatures as they may\r\nrepresent in their compositions, while they are careful to preserve\r\nheraldic consistency and to express heraldic feeling, they exhibit\r\nbeauty of form coupled with freedom of action and an appropriate\r\nexpression. \"Freedom of action\" I intend to imply more than such skilful\r\ndrawing, as will impart to any particular creature the idea of free\r\nmovement of frame and limb: it refers also to repeated representations\r\nof the same creature, under the same heraldic conditions of motive and\r\nattitude. And, here \"freedom of action\" implies those slight, yet\r\nsignificant, modifications of minor details which, without in the least\r\ndegree affecting armorial truth, prevent even the semblance of\r\nmonotonous reiteration. Thus, at Beverley, in the Percy Shrine in the\r\nMinster, upon a shield of England the three lions are all heraldically\r\nthe same; but, there is nothing of sameness in them nevertheless,\r\nbecause in each one there is some little variety in the turn of the\r\nhead, or in the placing of the paws, or in the sweep of the tail. And\r\nagain, in Westminster Hall, the favourite badge of Richard II., a white\r\nhart, chained, and in an attitude of rest, is repeated as many as\r\neighty-three times; and all are equally consistent with heraldic truth\r\nand accuracy, without any one of them being an exact counterpart of any\r\nother. In Nos. 25 and 26 two examples are shown from this remarkable\r\nseries of representations of this beautiful badge, each one different\r\nfrom the other, and yet both really the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE GRAMMAR OF HERALDRY\r\n\r\nSECTION I\r\n\r\n  _The Language of Heraldry-- The Nomenclature-- Style and Forms of\r\n  Expression-- Blazon-- The Shield: its Parts, Points, Divisions,\r\n  Dividing Lines, Varieties of Form, and Heraldic Treatment._\r\n\r\n  \"The shield hangs down on every breast.\"\r\n    --LORD OF THE ISLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LANGUAGE OF HERALDRY.--The original language of English Heraldry was\r\nthe Norman-French, which may also be designated Anglo-Norman, habitually\r\nspoken at the Court of England in the early heraldic era. After a while,\r\na mixed language succeeded, compounded of English and the original\r\nNorman-French; and this mixed language still continues in use.\r\n\r\nNOMENCLATURE.--Like its language, the Nomenclature of English Heraldry\r\nis of a mixed character, in part technical and peculiar to itself, and\r\nin part the same that is in common use. Thus, many of the figures and\r\ndevices of Heraldry have their peculiar heraldic names and titles, while\r\nstill more bear their ordinary designations. Descriptive terms, whether\r\nexpressed in English or in French (Anglo-Norman), are generally employed\r\nwith a special heraldic intention and significance. In the earliest Roll\r\nof Arms known to be now in existence, which was compiled (as appears\r\nfrom internal evidence) between the years 1240 and 1245, the\r\nNomenclature is the same that is found in Rolls and other heraldic\r\ndocuments of a later date. This fact of the existence of a definite\r\nNomenclature at that time, proves that before the middle of the\r\nthirteenth century the Heraldry of England was subject to a systematic\r\ncourse of treatment, and had become established and recognised as a\r\ndistinct and independent Science.\r\n\r\nSTYLE AND FORMS OF EXPRESSION.--With the Nomenclature, a settled Style\r\nand certain fixed technical Forms of Expression were introduced and\r\naccepted in the thirteenth century; and, since that period, the Style\r\nand Forms of Expression have undergone only such comparatively slight\r\nmodifications as tended to render them both more complete and more\r\nconsistent. As it was at the first, it still is the essence of heraldic\r\nlanguage to be concise yet complete, expressive, and also abounding in\r\nsuggestions. Not a syllable is expressed that is not absolutely\r\nnecessary; not a syllable omitted, the absence of which might possibly\r\nlead to any doubt or uncertainty. In the more matured style, the\r\nrepetition of any important word in the same sentence is scrupulously\r\navoided; and, where it would be required, another form of expression is\r\nsubstituted in its stead. Much meaning also is left to be implied and\r\nunderstood, through inference, either based upon certain accepted rules\r\nand established heraldic usages for the arrangement of the words and\r\nclauses of a sentence, or derived from the natural qualities and\r\ncharacteristic conditions of certain figures and devices: but, nothing\r\nis ever left to be inferred when an uncertain inference might possibly\r\nbe adopted, or that can be understood clearly and with certainty only by\r\nmeans of an explicit statement. Superfluous words and particles of all\r\nkinds are altogether omitted. Descriptive epithets follow the nouns to\r\nwhich they refer: as, a _red cross_ is styled a _cross gules_. The\r\ngeneral rules, by which the arrangement of the words in heraldic\r\ndescriptive sentences is determined, will be found in the last\r\nsubdivision of this chapter. Examples of heraldic Language,\r\nNomenclature, Style and Forms of Expression, will be given in abundance\r\nthroughout the following chapters and sections of this treatise. With\r\nthese examples students will do well to familiarise themselves: then,\r\nlet them prepare additional examples for that \"practice,\" which (as\r\nParker's \"Glossary of Heraldry\" says, p. 60) \"alone will make perfect,\"\r\nby writing down correct descriptions of heraldic compositions from the\r\ncompositions themselves; after which process they may advantageously\r\nreverse the order of their study, and make drawings of these same (or,\r\nif they prefer it, of some other) heraldic compositions from their own\r\nwritten descriptions of them.\r\n\r\nWhen any heraldic description of a figure, device, or composition has\r\nbeen completed, a statement is made to signify the person, family,\r\ncommunity, or realm whose armorial ensign it may be. This is done by\r\nsimply writing the appropriate name, after the last word of the\r\ndescription; or, by prefixing the word \"for\" before the name when it is\r\nplaced in the same position. Thus, a description of the three lions of\r\nEngland is to be followed by the word--\"ENGLAND\"; or, by the\r\nformula--\"for ENGLAND.\" If preferred, with equal consistency the\r\narrangement may be reversed, and the Name, with or without the prefix\r\n\"for,\" may precede the description: thus--\"ENGLAND,\" or \"For ENGLAND,\"\r\nthree lions, &c. It is to be borne in remembrance, that armorial ensigns\r\nare personal inheritances, and--with the exception of Sovereign\r\nPrinces--by comparison but very rarely relate to _Titles_ and\r\n_Dignities_.\r\n\r\nBLAZON, BLAZONING, BLAZONRY.--When a knight entered the lists at a\r\ntournament, his presence was announced by sound of trumpet or horn,\r\nafter which the officers of arms, the official Heralds, declared his\r\narmorial insignia--they \"blazoned\" his Arms. This term, \"to blazon,\"\r\nderived from the German word \"_blasen_,\" signifying \"to blow a blast on\r\na horn\" (or, as one eminent German Herald prefers, from the old German\r\nword \"_blaze_\" or \"_blasse_,\" \"a mark\" or \"sign\"), in Heraldry really\r\ndenotes either to _describe_ any armorial figure, device, or composition\r\nin correct heraldic language; or to _represent_ such figure, device, or\r\ncomposition accurately in form, position, arrangement, and colouring.\r\nBut, as a matter of practical usage, pictorial representation is usually\r\nallied to the word \"emblazon.\" The word \"blazon\" also, as a noun, may be\r\nemployed with a general and comprehensive signification to denote\r\n\"Heraldry.\"\r\n\r\nTHE SHIELD:--ITS PARTS, POINTS, AND DIVISIONS.--Their Shield, which the\r\nknights of the Middle Ages derived from the military usage of antiquity,\r\nand which contributed in so important a degree to their own defensive\r\nequipment, was considered by those armour-clad warriors to be peculiarly\r\nqualified to display their heraldic blazonry. And, in later times, when\r\narmour had ceased to be worn, and when shields no longer were actually\r\nused, a Shield continued to be regarded as the most appropriate vehicle\r\nfor the same display. The Shield, then, which with its armorial devices\r\nconstitutes a _Shield of Arms_, always is considered to display its\r\nblazonry upon its face or external surface. This blazoned surface of his\r\nshield the bearer, when holding it before his person, presents (or would\r\npresent, were he so to hold it) towards those who confront him. The\r\nright and the left sides of the person of the bearer of a Shield,\r\nconsequently, are _covered_ by the right and left (in heraldic language,\r\nthe _dexter_ and _sinister_) sides of his shield: and so, from this it\r\nfollows that the dexter and sinister sides of a Shield of Arms are\r\nseverally _opposite_ to the left and the right hands of all observers.\r\nThe Parts and Points of an heraldic Shield, which is also entitled an\r\n\"_Escutcheon_,\" are thus distinguished:--\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 27.]\r\n\r\n  No. 27. A, _The chief_:\r\n          B, _The Base_:\r\n          C, _The Dexter Side_:\r\n          D, _The Sinister Side_:\r\n          E, _The Dexter Chief_:\r\n          F, _The Sinister Chief_:\r\n          G, _The Middle Chief_:\r\n          H, _The Dexter Base_:\r\n          I, _The Sinister Base_:\r\n          K, _The Middle Base_:[2]\r\n          L, _The Honour Point_:\r\n          M, _The Fesse Point_.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: This term is very seldom if ever used.]\r\n\r\nIn blazoning the Divisions of a Shield, the term \"_Per_,\" signifying \"in\r\nthe direction of,\" is employed sometimes alone, and sometimes (having\r\nthe same signification) preceded by the word \"parted\" or \"party.\" The\r\nprimary Divisions of a Shield are indicated in the following diagrams,\r\nNos. 28-35:--\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Nos. 28-30, 31-33, 34-35.]\r\n\r\nNo. 28. _Per Pale_, or _Parted per Pale_, or _Party per Pale_.\r\n\r\nNo. 29. _Per Fesse_, or _Parted per Fesse_.\r\n\r\nNo. 30. (Nos. 28 and 29 together) _Per Cross_, or _Quarterly_ (the\r\nlatter is the more usual term).\r\n\r\nNo. 31. _Per Bend._ No. 32. _Per Bend Sinister._\r\n\r\nNo. 33. (Nos. 31 and 32 together) _Per Saltire._\r\n\r\nNo. 34. _Per Chevron._\r\n\r\nNo. 35. Tierced in pale (divided into three equal divisions by two\r\nvertical lines), a form seldom met with in English Heraldry. Technically\r\nthis in English Heraldry is simply the representation of a pale. (See\r\nNo. 87.)\r\n\r\nTo these divisions should strictly be added the further division\r\n_gyronny_ (No. 147); but neither the term _per_ nor _parted per_ is\r\never employed in this connection. As will be seen, it is a combination\r\nof the forms shown in Nos. 30 and 33.\r\n\r\nA Shield may be further divided and subdivided, thus:--\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 36.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 37.]\r\n\r\nIt may be divided into any number of _Quarterings_ by lines drawn _per\r\npale_ and _per fesse_, cutting each other, as in No. 36, which Shield is\r\n_quarterly of eight_: in like manner the _Quarterings_ of any Shield,\r\nwhatever their number (which need not be an even number), are blazoned\r\nas, _quarterly of twelve, &c._ This, to whatever extent the dividing of\r\nthe Shield may be carried, is _simple Quartering_. Again: a quartered\r\nShield may have one or more of its primary quarters, or every one of\r\nthem, _quartered_: this, which is the subdivision of a part, _the\r\nquartering of quarters_, is _compound Quartering_: for example, in No.\r\n37, the Shield is first divided into the _four primary quarters_,\r\nseverally marked A, B, C, D; then, so far as the quarters A, B, D are\r\nconcerned, the \"simple quartering\" is subjected to the process of\r\n\"compound quartering,\" and quarters A, D are _quarters quarterly_, and B\r\nis _a quarter quarterly of six_, while C remains unaffected by the\r\nsecondary process. The terms \"_quarterly quartering_\" and \"_quarterly\r\nquartered_\" are used to signify such secondary quartering as is\r\nexemplified in A, B, D of No. 37. The four primary quarters (A, B, C,\r\nD of No. 37) are distinguished as _Grand Quarters_: consequently, the\r\nquarter B of this example is the _second grand quarter, quarterly of\r\nsix_. This term \"Grand Quarter\" may be employed to distinguish any\r\nprimary quarter when any quarter in the Shield is \"quarterly quartered.\"\r\n\r\nDIVIDING and BORDER LINES, in addition to simple right lines and curves,\r\nassume the forms that are represented in the next diagram, No. 38:--\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 38.]\r\n\r\n  No. 38.

Some early Shields are\r\nrepresented as _bowed_--hollowed, that is, in order to cover more\r\nclosely the person of the bearer, and consequently having a convex\r\nexternal contour, as in No. 39. In early examples of bowed Shields the\r\nwhole of the armorial blazonry is sometimes displayed on the face of\r\nthat portion of the Shield which is shown. A _ridge_, dividing them in\r\npale, but not necessarily in any way acting as an heraldic dividing\r\nline, appears in many Shields, and particularly in those of the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The large elongated Shields that have\r\nbeen entitled \"kite-shaped,\" and which were in use in the days of\r\nRICHARD I. and amongst the Barons of Magna Charta, were superseded by\r\nthe smaller \"heater-shaped\" Shield as early as the reign of HENRY III.\r\nThe most beautiful forms of this Shield are represented in Nos. 40, 41,\r\nand 42: of these, No. 40 has its curves described about the sides of an\r\ninverted equilateral triangle, and then they are prolonged by vertical\r\nlines towards the chief: in Nos. 41, 42, the sides curve from the chief\r\nto the base. The forms of Shields admit of various slight modifications,\r\nto adjust them to varying conditions. Towards the close of the\r\nfourteenth century the form of the Shield is found to undergo some\r\nsingular changes: and, at later periods, changes in form of this kind\r\nbecame generally prevalent. Nos. 43, 44, exemplify such changes as\r\nthese: they also show the curved notch that was cut in the dexter chief\r\nof the Shields of the same periods, to permit the lance to pass through\r\nit as the Shield hung down on the breast: a Shield so pierced is said to\r\nbe _à bouche_. The Surface of the Shield, No. 43, which is in the\r\nEpiscopal palace at Exeter, is wrought into a series of shallow hollows,\r\nwhich curve gracefully from the central ridge, some to the dexter, and\r\nothers to the sinister. Such a Shield as this may be consistently used\r\nin our own Heraldry: but, since now we do not associate lances laid in\r\nrest with our heraldic Shields, it appears desirable that we should not\r\ndraw our Shields _à bouche_. In recent Heraldry the Shield has commonly\r\nbeen made to appear such an unsightly and un-heraldic deformity as is\r\nrepresented in No. 45. Instead of a true heraldic Shield also, a rounded\r\noval with a convex surface, called a _cartouche_, or _cartouche shield_,\r\nNo. 46, is occasionally used for the display of armorial blazonry; or a\r\ncircle is substituted for such an oval. These cartouches probably owe\r\ntheir origin to the usage of placing a Garter of the Order about a\r\nShield (prevalent in the fifteenth century), and to a subsequent period,\r\nwhen we find the omission of the exact outline of the actual Shield. But\r\ntheir frequent appearance in Ecclesiastical Heraldry suggests that\r\nperhaps they were deliberately preferred to the purely military shield.\r\nA _Lozenge_, No. 47, takes the place of a Shield to bear the arms of\r\nLadies, with the exception of the Sovereign; this very inconvenient\r\nsubstitute for the heraldic Shield was introduced early in the\r\nfourteenth century.\r\n\r\nTHE SHIELD: ITS HERALDIC TREATMENT.--When a Shield is represented as\r\nstanding erect, it is not necessary to specify that fact, since such a\r\nposition may be assumed for a Shield unless another be set forth in\r\nblazoning. Shields are sometimes made to appear suspended by the\r\n_guige_, or shield-belt (which was worn by Knights to sustain and secure\r\ntheir Shields to their persons); in some Seals and generally in\r\narchitectural compositions, Shields-of-Arms appear suspended, erect,\r\nfrom their guiges; at Westminster some of the earliest Shields are thus\r\nsuspended, with a very happy effect, from two points of suspension, the\r\nguige passing over sculptured heads, as in No. 48, the Arms of Provence,\r\nborne by ALIANORE of Provence, Queen of HENRY III.--the _shield_ is\r\n_gold_, and on it are blazoned _four red pallets_. In Seals, the\r\nsuspended Shield is generally represented hanging by the sinister-chief\r\nangle, as in No. 49; and it hangs thus diagonally from below the helm.\r\nA Shield thus placed is said to be \"_couché_.\" This arrangement is also\r\nfrequently adopted, when a Shield or an Achievement of arms is not\r\nplaced upon a Seal; but in any case the position has no importance\r\nexcept as a matter of artistic treatment.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 48.--Arms of Provence, Westminster Abbey.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 49.--Shield Couché.]\r\n\r\nThe entire surface of every Shield is termed the \"_Field_.\" The same\r\nterm is also applied to _every plain surface_. A Shield is said to be\r\n\"borne\" by the personage to whom it belongs: and, in its turn, the\r\nShield \"bears\" whatever figures and devices may be displayed upon it;\r\nwhence, all these figures and devices are entitled \"_Bearings_\" or\r\n\"_Armorial Bearings_.\" All figures and devices are also styled\r\n\"_Charges_\"; and they are said to be \"_charged_\" upon a Shield, Banner,\r\nor Surcoat, or upon one another. In blazoning, the field of the Shield\r\nis always first noticed and described: next follow the charges that rest\r\nupon the field of the Shield itself; then descriptions are given of the\r\nsecondary bearings that are charged upon others of greater importance.\r\nAs a general rule, of several charges which all alike rest immediately\r\nupon the field of the Shield, the most important is the first to be\r\nblazoned; so that the arrangement of blazoning is determined by the\r\ncomparative dignity of the bearings, as well as by the degree in which\r\ncharges are nearer to the field and further from beholders. In some\r\ncases, however, a bearing charged upon the field of a Shield and many\r\ntimes repeated on a small scale, is blazoned (for the sake of simplicity\r\nand clearness of expression) next to the field of the Shield\r\nitself:--thus, if a lion be charged on the field of a Shield, and a\r\nconsiderable number of crosses surround the lion, and, like him, are\r\nplaced on the field of the Shield also--the field of the Shield is\r\nblazoned first, the crosses second, and the lion third; and, if a\r\ncrescent (or other bearing) be charged upon the lion's shoulder, it is\r\nthe last in the blazon. In quartered Shields the blazoning commences\r\nafresh with each quartering. In blazoning armorial banners and\r\nhorse-trappings, the latter often gorgeously enriched with heraldic\r\nblazonry, the dexter side of a flag is always next to the staff, and the\r\nhead of a horse is supposed always to be looking towards the dexter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE GRAMMAR OF HERALDRY\r\n\r\nSECTION II\r\n\r\n  _The Tinctures' Metals-- Colours-- Furs-- Varied Fields-- Law of\r\n  Tinctures-- Counterchanging-- Diaper-- Disposition-- Blazoning in\r\n  Tinctures._\r\n\r\n  \"All the devices blazoned on the Shield\r\n  In their own tinct\"\r\n    --ELAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn English Heraldry the TINCTURES comprise _Two Metals_, _Five Colours_,\r\nand _Eight Furs_. They are symbolised or indicated by dots and lines--a\r\nvery convenient system, said to have been introduced, about the year\r\n1630, by an Italian named Silvestre de Petrasancta. Some such\r\nsymbolisation, however, may occasionally be found in anticipation of\r\nPetrasancta. The system now in use was not generally adopted till the\r\ncommencement of the eighteenth century. This system is never officially\r\nemployed in a matter of record, and is now being discarded by many\r\nartists. The Metals, Colours, and Furs are named, their names are\r\nabbreviated, and they are severally indicated, as follows:--\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 50.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 51.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 52.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 53.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 54.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 55.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 56.]\r\n\r\nTWO METALS.\r\n\r\n                TITLES     ABBREVIATIONS     SYMBOLISATION.\r\n\r\n  1.

These\r\ntwo are sometimes termed stains, but their real usage was in liveries.\r\nThe Furs, Nos. 58, 59, 60, 63, 64, and 65, are of comparatively rare\r\noccurrence, and do not appear in the best ages of Heraldry. _Vair_ and\r\n_Ermine_ are common. A good early form of _Vair_ is shown in No. 62: and\r\nin No. 57A, I give a fine example of the treatment of _Ermine_, from the\r\nmonument of EDWARD III.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 57A.]\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid repeating or referring to the word \"_Or_,\" the word\r\n\"_Gold_\" is sometimes used. The Furs, Nos. 61, 62, 63, 64, and 65, are\r\nalways _argent_ and _azure_, unless some other metal and colour be named\r\nin the blazoning. Animated beings and all objects, that in Heraldry are\r\nrepresented in their natural aspect and colouring, are blazoned\r\n\"_proper_\" abbreviated _ppr._ Heraldic charges and compositions, when\r\nsketched in outline with pen and ink or with pencil, and with the\r\ncolours _written_ thereon, are said to be \"_tricked_,\" or \"_in trick_.\"\r\n\r\nVARIED FIELDS.--It is not necessary that the Field of a Shield, or of\r\nany Bearing, should be of any one uniform tincture: but varied surfaces\r\nare usually tinctured of some one metal and some one colour alternating;\r\nand the patterns or devices thus produced are generally derived (the\r\nFurs, Nos. 61-65, which are good examples of varied surfaces, being the\r\nexceptions) from the forms of the original simple charges that are\r\ndistinguished as _Ordinaries_ and _Subordinaries._ And these varied\r\nsurfaces or fields are always _flat_; the whole of their devices or\r\npatterns are _level_, their metal and colour lying in the same plane. It\r\nis evident that, in representing any examples of this class, no shading\r\nis to be introduced to denote relief.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 66.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 67.]\r\n\r\nShould the field of any charge be divided into a single row of small\r\nsquares, alternately, _e.g._ of a metal and a colour, as No. 66, it is\r\n_Componée_ or _Compony_ (sometimes written _gobony_): if into two such\r\nrows, as in No. 67, it is _Counter Compony_: but, if the field of a\r\nShield, or the surface of any charge be divided into three, or more than\r\nthree, such rows, it is _Chequée_ or _Checky_; thus, the Arms of the\r\nEarl de WARENNE are _Chequée or and az._, No. 68 (H. 3 and E. 2).\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF TINCTURES.--Every charge is supposed to rest upon the field\r\nof a Shield, or on the surface of some charge. It is a strict rule, that\r\na charge of a metal must rest upon a field that is of a colour or fur;\r\nor, contrariwise, that a charge of a colour must rest on a field that is\r\nof a metal or fur,--that is, that _metal be not on metal, nor colour on\r\ncolour_. This rule is modified in the case of _varied fields_, upon\r\nwhich may be charged a bearing of either a metal or a colour: also,\r\na partial relaxation of the rule is conceded when one bearing is charged\r\nupon another, should the conditions of any particular case require such\r\na concession. This rule does not apply to bordures, nor very stringently\r\nto augmentations or crests, and it is not so rigidly enforced in Foreign\r\nas in British Heraldry. There are, of course, a few exceptions, but they\r\nare not numerous, the one usually instanced as an intentional violation\r\nbeing the _silver_ armorial Shield of the CRUSADER KINGS of JERUSALEM,\r\nNo. 69, upon which _five golden crosses_ are charged; the motive in this\r\nremarkable exception to an established rule being said to be to cause\r\nthis Shield to be unlike that of any other potentate. What may be termed\r\nthe accessories of a charge are not included in this law of tinctures:\r\nthus, a silver lion having a red tongue may be charged on a blue shield,\r\nand the red tongue may rest on the blue field of the Shield.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 69.--Arms of Jerusalem.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 70.--Arms of Fenwick.]\r\n\r\nCOUNTERCHANGING is dividing the field of a Shield in such a manner that\r\nit is, _e.g._ in part of a metal and in part of a colour, and then\r\narranging the charges in such a manner that they shall be reciprocally\r\nof the same colour and metal: thus, the shield of John Fenwick, No. 70\r\n(R. 2) is,--_per-fesse gu. and arg., six martlets, three, two, one,\r\ncounterchanged_; that is, the field is red in chief and silver in base,\r\nand the birds or parts of the birds on the red field are silver, and\r\nthose on the silver field are red.\r\n\r\nDIAPERING.--This term denotes a system of decorating plain surfaces in\r\nvarious ways, which was in great favour with the early heraldic artists.\r\nIn the use of Diaper, which is often desirable when artistic reasons\r\nsuggest its suitability, care must be taken that the decorative designs\r\nand patterns do not in any way admit of their being mistaken for\r\ncharges. This diaper may be executed in low relief, subordinated to the\r\nrelief of the charges; and it is not required to yield any obedience to\r\nthe law of tinctures. In the Shield, No. 68 (the original, a very noble\r\nshield, is at Castle Acre Priory, Norfolk), which is simply _chequée_,\r\nthe Diapering may be alternately azure and or on the squares that are\r\nalternately or and azure; or the Diaper may be dark blue, or sable, or\r\nargent on the azure squares, and on the golden ones whatever the artist\r\nmight consider would be most effective; but the Diaper, in this and in\r\nall other examples, must always be subordinate to the area and tincture\r\nof the field. The finest known early example of heraldic Diaper in\r\nenamel, is the Shield of WILLIAM DE VALENCE, Earl of PEMBROKE, in\r\nWestminster Abbey, A.D. 1296. Very beautiful early examples of Diapering\r\nhave been preserved in relics of heraldic stained glass.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 68.--Shield of Arms of Earl de Warrenne,\r\n  Castle Acre Priory, Norfolk.]\r\n\r\nDISPOSITION: BLAZONING.--By _Disposition_ is understood the placing and\r\narranging of charges. A single important charge, which has not a fixed\r\nposition of its own, is placed in the centre of any composition: and\r\nminor charges are arranged in their most natural and consistent order\r\nand positions, any deviation from which must be specified. A single\r\ncharge, many times repeated, and small in size, whether with or without\r\nany special orderly disposition, is said to be _Semée_--strewn, that is,\r\nor scattered over the field, as seed is sown by the hand; or, if the\r\ncharges are very small or very numerous, the term _poudrée_ or\r\n_powdered_ has sometimes been used. The expression--\"_three, two, one_,\"\r\nsignifies that a charge is repeated six times, the Disposition being\r\nthree in a horizontal row towards the chief of the Shield, then two in a\r\nsimilar row in the centre, and one in base. In the same manner, the\r\nexpressions--\"_four, four, one_,\" \"_four, three, two, one_,\" \"_three and\r\none_,\" &c., are used as occasion may require. For other dispositions of\r\ncharges other appropriate terms will present themselves to our notice,\r\ngrowing out of our subject as it advances.\r\n\r\nShould a _Tincture_ or a _Number_ occur a second time in blazoning a\r\nsingle composition, it must be indicated, not by repeating the word\r\nalready used, but by reference to it. Thus, if the tincture of the field\r\nshould occur a second time, reference is made to it in the formula--\"_of\r\nthe field_:\" or, perhaps more frequently--\"_of the first_;\" or, if the\r\ntincture that is named second in order in the blazoning be repeated, it\r\nis indicated by the expression--\"_of the second_;\" and so on. Again:\r\nshould there be three fleurs de lys and also three crescents in one and\r\nthe same composition, having specified the \"three fleurs de lys,\" the\r\nnumber of the crescents would be set forth in the words--\"_as many_\r\ncrescents:\" providing nothing else has in the wording of the blazon\r\nintervened in such a way as to cause uncertainty by the use of the term;\r\nand so, in like manner, with any other numbers of these or of any other\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\nIn descriptive Blazoning, Epithets, which follow their own Nouns,\r\nprecede the Tinctures that are associated with those nouns: thus,\r\na black rampant lion having golden claws is blazoned,--_a lion rampt.\r\nsa., armed or_. In written and printed blazoning, the arrangement of the\r\nwords and the placing the stops are alike matters of supreme importance.\r\nThe sentences are to be short. A comma is to mark the end of each\r\ncomplete minor clause or division of a sentence: a colon, each more\r\nimportant clause. A point or period is to follow every abbreviated word,\r\nto mark the fact of the abbreviation, but without affecting the\r\nadditional presence of a comma (as in the blazoning, \"_a lion rampant\r\nsa._,\") or of a colon, as the case may be; but a second period is\r\nunnecessary. It is a very common error to overload heraldic blazoning\r\nwith commas which, instead of aiding to simplify the sentences, obscure\r\nthe meaning and perplex the reader. It is always correct to\r\nwrite--\"_three lion's heads_,\" \"_six pilgrim's staves_,\" &c.: and always\r\nincorrect to write--\"_three lions' heads_,\" \"_six pilgrims' staves_,\"\r\n&c.; but it is a point printers have an apparently invincible objection\r\nto accept.\r\n\r\nEMBLAZONING IN TINCTURES.--On this head I must be content to offer to\r\nstudents only a few brief practical observations. The metal _Gold_ may\r\nbe rendered with gold prepared in small saucers, or (most\r\nadvantageously) in minute slabs; this preparation is applied, like a\r\ncommon water-colour, by moistening the gold with water; and it is\r\ndesirable previously to have washed the paper, card (or vellum) with\r\ndiluted white of egg. Gold leaf may also be used, but the process is\r\ntedious, and requires both skill and experience to ensure complete\r\nsuccess. Yellow paint, again, may be used to represent the metal, the\r\nbest colours being _cadmium yellow_, or \"_aureolin_\" (Winsor and Newton)\r\nmixed with _Chinese white_. For shading, _carmine_, or _crimson lake_,\r\nmixed with gum. For _Silver_, _aluminium_ may be used with excellent\r\neffect; or _Chinese white_; or the paper may be left white: for shading,\r\n_grey_ (_blue_ and _Indian ink_ mixed) and gum. The Aluminium is\r\nprepared, like the gold, in minute slabs: it may be obtained, of great\r\nexcellence, from Messrs. Winsor & Newton, by whom also a very pure\r\npreparation of gold is sold; but both the gold and the aluminium slabs\r\nare sold by all good artists' colourmen. These Metals may be diapered,\r\nas well as burnished, with an agate-burnisher.\r\n\r\nFor _Azure_:--_French blue_, freely mixed with _Chinese white_ and a\r\nvery little gum, the colour to be laid on thick: shade with _Prussian\r\nblue_ mixed with a larger proportion of gum. For _Gules_:--_Orange\r\nvermilion_ either pure, or mixed with a very little _cadmium yellow_ or\r\n_Chinese white_, and still less gum: (never use a brilliant but most\r\ntreacherous preparation known as \"pure scarlet:\") shade with _carmine_\r\nor _crimson lake_, and gum. For _Vert_:--_emerald green_, with _Chinese\r\nwhite_ and a little gum: shade with dark green, made from mixing\r\n_aureolin_ (or _gamboge_) with _Prussian blue_ and gum. For\r\n_Purpure_:--mix _carmine_ and _French blue_, with a little gum: shade\r\nwith a darker tint of the same. For _Sable_:--Very dark _grey_, made by\r\nmixing a little _Chinese white_ and gum with black: shade with black and\r\nmore gum.\r\n\r\nWhen the Metals are rendered by gold and aluminium, it is desirable that\r\nthese tinctures should be applied, and that the diapering and burnishing\r\nof the Metals should also be completed with the burnisher, before the\r\nadjoining colours are laid on. The burnishing may be executed in two or\r\nthree hours after the Metals have been applied to the paper; and the\r\npaper should be placed upon a piece of glass during the processes of\r\nburnishing and diapering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE GRAMMAR OF HERALDRY\r\n\r\nSECTION III\r\n\r\n  _The Ordinaries:-- The Chief; Fesse; Bar; Pale; Cross, its heraldic\r\n  varieties; Bend; Saltire; Chevron; and Pile._\r\n\r\n  \"Marks of Hereditary Honour, given or authorised by some supreme\r\n  Power.\"\r\n    --SCIENCE OF HERALDRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARIES.--The simple Charges of early Heraldry, which always have\r\nbeen held in the highest esteem and which are most familiar, are:--The\r\n_Chief_, the _Fesse_, the _Bar_, the _Pale_, the _Cross_, the _Bend_,\r\nthe _Saltire_, the _Chevron_, and the _Pile_. They may be considered to\r\nhave been derived from various means that were adopted to strengthen\r\nShields for use in combat, the _Cross_ always being in great favour from\r\nhaving a definite symbolism of its own. These Ordinaries may be formed\r\nby any of the Border Lines, No. 38. Occasionally they are borne alone;\r\nbut more generally they are associated with other bearings, or they have\r\nvarious figures and devices charged upon themselves. In some cases,\r\npresently to be specified, more than one Ordinary may appear in a single\r\ncomposition. The _Bar_, the _Pale_, the _Bend_, and the _Chevron_ have\r\n_Diminutives_. The _Cross_ has many _Varieties_.\r\n\r\nTHE CHIEF (H. 3), bounded by a horizontal line, contains the uppermost\r\nthird (or, in practice, somewhat less than the third, of the field of a\r\nShield, as in No. 71. The Shield of LE BOTILER, No. 72, is--_Or, a chief\r\nindented az._ (H. 3). A Chief may be borne with any other Ordinary\r\nexcept the Fesse; it may also be charged with any other figures or\r\ndevices:--thus, for Sire BERNARD DE BRUS, No. 73,--_Az., a chief and a\r\nsaltire or_: for Sire JOHAN DE CLINTONE, No. 74,--_Arg., on a chief az.\r\ntwo fleurs de lys or_: and for Sire JOHAN DE CLINTONE de Madestoke, No.\r\n75,--_Arg., on a chief az. two mullets or_ (all E. 2). When any charge\r\nis set in the uppermost third of a Shield, or when several charges are\r\ndisposed in a horizontal row across the uppermost part of a Shield, they\r\nall are said to be \"_in Chief_.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 71.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 72.--Le Botiler.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 73.--De Brus.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 74.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 75.--De Clintone.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 76.--De Clifford]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 77.--De Pateshulle.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 78.--Le Vavasour.]\r\n\r\nTHE FESSE (H. 3), which crosses the centre of a Shield horizontally,\r\nwhen charged occupies about one-third (or rather less than one-third) of\r\nthe field; but when without charges, it is usually drawn somewhat\r\nnarrower. The Shield of Lord CLIFFORD is,--_Chequée or and az., a fesse\r\ngu._, No. 76. For ROBT. LE FITZ-WATER,--_Or, a fesse between two\r\nchevrons gu._: for JOHN DE PATESHULLE, No. 77,--_Arg., a fesse sa.,\r\nbetween three crescents gu._ (all H.3): for WILLIAM LE VAVASOUR, No.\r\n78,--_Or, a fesse dancette sa._: for DE HEMENHALE, No. 79,--_Or, on a\r\nfesse between two chevrons gu., three escallops arg._: and for DE\r\nDAGEWORTHE, No. 80,--_Erm., a fesse gu. bezantée_ (all E. 2). When they\r\nare disposed in a horizontal row across the centre of a Shield, Charges\r\nare \"_in fesse_.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 79.--De Hemenhale.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 80.--De Dageworthe.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 81.--De Harecourt.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 82.--Wake.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 83.--De Huntercumbe.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 84.--De la Mere.]\r\n\r\nTHE BAR (H. 3), which may be placed horizontally in any part of the\r\nfield except in fesse or at the chief of the Shield, is about one-fifth\r\nof the field (or sometimes less) in depth. A single bar very rarely\r\noccurs in blazon. Examples:--_Or, two bars gu._,--for DE HARECOURT, No.\r\n81: _Az., two bars dancettée or_,--for DE RIVERES: _Or, two bars gu., in\r\nchief three torteaux_,--for WAKE, No. 82. The Diminutive of the Bar is\r\nthe _Barrulet_, one-half of its width. When they are disposed in\r\ncouples, Barrulets are _Bars Gemelles_, these not being so deep as the\r\nbarrulet: thus, No. 83,--for DE HUNTERCUMBE,--_Erm., two bars gemelles\r\ngu._ (H. 3). A Fesse or Bar, when placed between two similar figures\r\nnarrower than barrulets, is said to be _cotised_ by them; or, to be\r\n\"doubly cotised,\" when placed between two bars gemelles: thus, for DE LA\r\nMERE, No. 84,--_Or, a fesse doubly cotised_ (or, _between two bars\r\ngemelles_) _az._ (E. 2). An _even_ number of bars alternately of a metal\r\n(or a fur) and a colour form the varied field which is to be blazoned\r\n\"_barry_,\" the number of the bars in every case to be specified--as,\r\n\"_barry of six_,\" \"_barry of eight_,\" &c. If the number of bars exceeds\r\n_eight_ (some writers say _ten_), it is \"_barrulée_\" or \"_barruly_\"; and\r\nin this case it is not necessary that the number of the bars should be\r\nspecified, the word _barrulée_ being used alone, or the expression\r\n\"_barrulée sans nombre_\" to denote a considerable number, but not a\r\nfixed number of bars--the number, however, always to be _even_. But this\r\nis a modern refinement of blazon to which little if any attention was\r\npaid in early days. It is to be observed that while the bars, whatever\r\ntheir number, if they are blazoned as bars, are to be treated as if they\r\nwere executed in relief upon the field of a Shield, a Shield that is\r\nbarry or barrulée has its field formed by bars which are all in the same\r\nplane. Examples:--_Barry of six or and gu._, for FITZ ALAN of Bedale,\r\nNo. 85: _Barry of six arg. and az._, for DE GREY: _Barry of eight or and\r\naz._,--for DE PENBRUGGE (all H. 3): _Barrulée arg. and az., an orle of\r\nmartlets gu._,--for DE VALENCE, Earl of PEMBROKE, No. 86; in this\r\nexample _ten_ bars are represented, but in the noble enamelled shield of\r\nthe first De Valence (A.D. 1296) preserved in Westminster Abbey, the\r\nbars are _twenty-eight_ in number. Charges, not \"in fesse\" or \"in\r\nchief,\" that are disposed horizontally across the field are\r\n\"_bar-wise_.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 85.--Fitzalan of Bedale.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 86.--De Valence.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 87.--Erskine.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 88.--Grandison.]\r\n\r\nTHE PALE.--Like the Fesse, this Ordinary occupies rather less than a\r\ncentral third of the field, but it is _vertical_ in its position instead\r\nof horizontal. No. 87, for ERSKINE, is--_Arg., a pale sa._ Its\r\nDiminutives, the _Pallet_ and the _Endorse_, severally one-half and\r\none-fourth of its width, may be placed vertically in any part of the\r\nfield. A Pale between two Endorses is \"_endorsed_\" but the term\r\n_cotised_ is also employed with this meaning. An _even_ number of\r\nPallets of a metal (or a fur) and a colour set alternately, form the\r\nvaried field to be blazoned \"_paly_,\" the number of the Pallets (which\r\nlie all in the same plane) always to be specified: thus--_Paly of six\r\narg. and az., on a bend gu. three eaglets displayed or_, for GRANDISON,\r\nNo. 88 (H. 3) Charges that are disposed one above another in a vertical\r\nrow are \"in pale.\" This is the arrangement of the three golden lions of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe CROSS (H. 3), formed from a combination of a Fesse with a Pale, in\r\nits simplest form is set erect in the centre of the field, and it\r\nextends to the border-lines of the Shield. If at any time it may be\r\nnecessary or apparently desirable specially to set forth in the\r\nblazoning of a Shield, that a Cross charged upon it does thus extend to\r\nthe border-lines, such a Cross is blazoned as a \"_Cross throughout_.\"\r\nNo. 1, _Arg., a Cross gu._, the armorial ensign of ST. GEORGE, the\r\nspecial Patron Saint of England, may be blazoned as \"_A Cross of St.\r\nGeorge_.\" Of this Cross, the great symbol of the Christian Faith,\r\nSpenser says--\r\n\r\n  \"And on his brest a bloodie Cross he bore,\r\n  The deare remembrance of his dying Lord....\r\n  Upon his Shield the like was also scored.\"\r\n\r\n  _Faerie Queen_, I. i. 2.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 89.--Cross fimbriated.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 90.--Cross pointed.]\r\n\r\nA Cross having a narrow border lying in the same plane with itself, is\r\n\"fimbriated,\" such a border being a \"_fimbriation_\": thus, No. 89, _Az.,\r\na cross gu., fimbriated arg._, represents the Cross of St. George in our\r\nNational \"Union Jack.\" A Cross having its four extremities cut off\r\nsquare, so that it does not extend in any direction to the border-lines\r\nof the shield, is \"_couped_\" or \"_humettée_\". If the extremities of a\r\nCross are cut off to points, it is \"_pointed_,\" as in No. 90. If its\r\ncentral area is entirely removed, so that but little more than its\r\noutlines remain, it is \"_voided_,\" or (H. 3) \"_a false Cross_\" (\"faux\r\ncroix\"): when its four limbs are _equal_ in length, it is a \"_Greek\r\nCross_,\" as No. 91: when the limbs are _unequal_, the lower limb or\r\nshaft being longer than the other three, as in No. 92, it is a \"_Latin\r\nCross_\" or a \"long cross\": but neither of these two last terms are used\r\nregarding the plain cross throughout, notwithstanding that differences\r\nin the shape of the shield may materially alter the proportion of the\r\nlimbs. If a cross be formed of a shaft and two horizontal limbs only\r\n(like the letter T), as in No. 93, it is a \"_Tau Cross_,\" or \"_Cross\r\nTau_\": if it is pierced at the intersection of the limbs, and the entire\r\ncentral area be voided, it is said to be \"_pierced quarterly_.\" A Latin\r\nCross on steps, is \"_on Degrees_,\" and it is distinguished as a \"Calvary\r\nCross.\" Charges having a cruciform arrangement are \"_in Cross_.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 91.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 92.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 93.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 94.--Quadrate.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 95.--Patriarchal.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 96.--Fourchée.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 97.--Cross Moline: Arms of De Molines.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 98.--Cross Recercelée: Arms of Bishop Anthony Bec.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 99.--Cross Patonce: Arms of William de Vesci.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 100.--Fleurie.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 101.--Fleurettée.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 102.--Pommée.]\r\n\r\nThe CROSS:--its HERALDIC VARIETIES. The Cross-symbol appears in English\r\nHeraldry under very many varieties and modifications of form and\r\ncondition, some of them of great beauty. The following engraved\r\nrepresentations of the various examples are so explicit, that\r\ndescriptions of them are unnecessary. The Cross _Quadrate_, No. 94. The\r\nCross _Patriarchal_, No. 95. The Cross _Fourchée_, No. 96. The Cross\r\n_Moline_, represented charged upon the Shield attributed to the SAXON\r\nKINGS OF ENGLAND, No. 23: this same shield--_Az., a Cross moline or_, is\r\nborne by DE MOLINES or MOLYNEUX, No. 97. The Cross _Cercelée_ or\r\n_Recercelée_ (H. 3),--_Gu., a Cross recercelée erm._, No. 98, for\r\nANTHONY BEC, Bishop of DURHAM. The Cross _Patonce_ (H. 3),--_Gu.,\r\na Cross patonce arg._, No. 99, from the Seal of WM. DE VESCI, A.D. 1220.\r\nThe Cross _Fleury_, No. 100, should be compared carefully with Nos. 97\r\nand 99, the Crosses _Moline_ and _Patonce_. The Cross _Fleurettée_, No.\r\n101. The Cross _Pommée_, No. 102. The Cross _Botonée_ or _Treflée_, No.\r\n103. The Cross _Crosslet_, or _Crosslet crossed_, No. 104. The term\r\n\"_Crosslet_\" is strictly applicable to any Cross on a very small scale:\r\nbut it is usually applied to denote a Cross that is crossed as in No.\r\n104. Small Crosses Botonée are occasionally used as these\r\n\"Crosses-Crosslets,\"--as at Warwick in the arms of the BEAUCHAMPS, the\r\nEarls of WARWICK. Crosslets are frequently blazoned _semée_ over the\r\nfield of a Shield, in which case the special term _crusilly_ is often\r\nused; and, in smaller numbers, they also are favourite Charges. No. 105\r\nis the Cross _Clechée_ or _Urdée_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 103.--Botonée.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 104.--Crosslet.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 105.--Clechée.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 106.--Patée.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 107.--Maltese.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 108.--Potent.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 109.--Avellane.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 110.--Botonée Fitchée.]\r\n\r\nThe Cross _Patée_ or _Formée_ is represented in No. 106. No. 107 is the\r\n\"_Cross of eight Points_,\" or the _Maltese_ Cross: this example is drawn\r\nfrom the portrait of PHILLIPPE DE VILLIERS DE L'ISLE-ADAM, elected\r\nforty-third Grand Master of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, A.D.\r\n1521; this picture is in the possession of the Earl of Clarendon, K.G.\r\nThe Cross _Potent_, No. 108. The Cross _Avellane_, No. 109. The\r\n_Crossed-Crosslet_, and the Crosses _Patée_, _Botonée_, and _Potent_,\r\nare also drawn having their shaft elongated and _pointed at the base_:\r\nin this form they are severally blazoned as a \"_Crossed-Crosslet\r\nFitchée_\" (or _fitched_), a \"_Cross Patée Fitchée_,\" &c.,--a Cross, that\r\nis, \"_fixable_\" in the ground; No. 110 is an example of a Cross _Botonée\r\nFitchée_. Several of these varieties of the heraldic Cross occur but\r\nrarely; and there are other somewhat fanciful varieties so little in\r\nuse, as to render any description of them unnecessary. The student of\r\nmediæval monumental antiquities will not fail to observe a certain\r\ndegree of resemblance between some of the Crosses of Heraldry, and those\r\nthat are incised and sculptured on sepulchral slabs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 111.--Le Scrope.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 112.--De Radclyffe.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 113.--Le Boteler.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 114.--Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 115.--Sir Gilbert de Bohun.]\r\n\r\nThe BEND (H. 3) resembles both the Fesse and the Pale in every\r\ncondition, except that it crosses the field _diagonally_ from the dexter\r\nchief to the sinister base. No. 111, the Shield of SCROPE, is--_Az.,\r\na bend or_. A celebrated contest for the right to bear this simple\r\nShield took place, A.D. 1385-1390, between Sir RICHARD LE SCROPE and Sir\r\nROBERT GROSVENOR, which was decided in favour of the former. No. 112,\r\nfor RADCLYFFE, is--_Arg., a bend engrailed sa._ Two uncharged Bends may\r\nappear in one composition: thus, for LE BOTELER--_Arg., two bends az._,\r\nNo. 113; and for FRERE--_Gu., two bends or_ (both H. 3). The Diminutives\r\nof the Bend are the _Bendlet_ and the _Cotise_, the one containing\r\none-half and the other one-fourth of its area. A Cotise is sometimes\r\nborne singly, when it is a _Riband_. A bendlet _couped_ is a baton.\r\nA Bend between two Cotises is _cotised_: thus, No. 114, for DE\r\nBOHUN,--_Az., a Bend arg., cotised or, between six lioncels rampt.\r\ngold_; this Shield is engraved from the Seal of HUMPHREY DE BOHUN,\r\nfourth Earl of HEREFORD (A.D. 1298-1322); in it the cotised Bend is very\r\nnarrow, evidently to give more space for the lioncels. Charges displayed\r\non a Bend _slope with it_--that is, they would be erect, were the Bend\r\nto be set vertically and to become a Pale: thus, another DE BOHUN, Sir\r\nGilbert (H. 3), distinguishes his Shield by tincturing his Bend _or_,\r\nand charging upon it _three escallops gules_, as in No. 115. In No. 88,\r\nthe eaglets also exemplify the disposition of charges upon a Bend.\r\nCharges set diagonally on the field of a Shield, in the position in\r\nwhich a bend would occupy, are said to be \"_in bend_\" and are arranged\r\nin the same manner: but it would be quite possible to have three or more\r\ncharges each disposed bendwise; but yet, nevertheless, when taken\r\ntogether occupying the position of a fesse and therefore described also\r\nas in fesse. This distinction between charges bendwise (or bendways) and\r\ncharges in bend should be carefully noted. A field divided into an\r\n_even_ number of parts by lines drawn _bendwise_, is \"_bendy_,\" the\r\nnumber of the divisions to be specified: as a matter of course, a field\r\nthus \"bendy\" becomes a \"varied field,\" in which all the divisions lie in\r\nthe same plane: thus, No. 116, for DE MONTFORD (H. 3 and E. 2)--_Bendy\r\nof ten or and az._ Bendlets are in relief, as in No. 117, for DE\r\nBRAY--_Vairée, three Bendlets gu._ If a field be divided by lines drawn\r\nbendwise, and also by others drawn either vertically or horizontally, it\r\nis \"_paly bendy_,\" as No. 118, or \"_barry bendy_,\" as No. 119. These two\r\nforms, which, however, are very rarely met with, should be carefully\r\ndistinguished from a field lozengy. A Bend issuing from the sinister\r\nchief is a _Bend Sinister_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 116.--De Montford.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 117.--De Bray.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 118.--Paly Bendy.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 119.--Barry Bendy.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 120.--St. Andrew.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 122.--De Neville.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 121.--De Neville.]\r\n\r\nThe SALTIRE (H. 3), a combination of a Bend with a Bend Sinister, may\r\nalso be regarded as a _Diagonal Cross_. Thus, the Crosses of St. ANDREW\r\nof SCOTLAND, and of St. PATRICK of IRELAND are Saltires--the former, No.\r\n120--_Az., a Saltire arg._: the latter--_Arg., a Saltire gu._ The arms\r\nof the great family of NEVILLE reverse those of St. PATRICK, and\r\nare--_Gu., a Saltire arg._, No. 121: so Drayton has recorded that\r\n\r\n  \"Upon his surcoat valiant NEVILLE bore\r\n  A silver Saltire upon martial red.\"\r\n    _Barons' War_, i. 22.\r\n\r\nCharges set on a Saltire _slope with its limbs_ (all, however, pointing\r\nto the chief), _the central charge being erect_; and the disposition of\r\ncharges set \"_in saltire_\" is the same: a single charge set on a Saltire\r\nis blazoned erect on the central point of the Ordinary, as in No. 122,\r\nanother Shield of NEVILLE, in which the \"Silver Saltire\" is charged with\r\na _rose gules_. A Saltire may be borne with a Chief, as in No. 73.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 123.--De Stafford.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 124.--Shield of De Clare.]\r\n\r\nThe CHEVRON (H. 3), in form and proportions is rather more than the\r\nlower half of a Saltire. The Diminutive is a _Chevronel_, containing\r\nhalf a Chevron, or perhaps less: thus, for DE STAFFORD (E. 2),--_Or,\r\na Chevron gu._, No. 123: for the great family of DE CLARE, from whom so\r\nmany other families derived their Chevrons and Chevronels--_Or, three\r\nChevronels gules_, No. 124 (H. 3). Two Chevrons may be borne in one\r\ncomposition: or they may appear with a Fesse, as in No. 79: or with a\r\nChief, as (H. 3), for DE CROMBE--_Erm., a Chevron gu., and on a Chief of\r\nthe last three escallops or_; for ST. QUINTIN (H. 3)--_Or, three\r\nChevronels gu., a Chief vair_. A field _Chevronée_ is of rare\r\noccurrence: the three Chevronels of DE CLARE, however, No. 124, appear\r\nto have been derived from a field _Chevronée_: certainly, on his seal,\r\n\"Strongbow\" has the Chevronée Shield, No. 125, about A.D. 1175. Charges\r\nset on a Chevron, or disposed \"_in Chevron_,\" are always placed erect.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 125.--Early shield of De Clare.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 126.--De Chandos.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 127.--De Brian.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 128.--De Bassett.]\r\n\r\nThe PILE (H. 3), resembling a wedge in form, is borne both single and in\r\nsmall groups. Unless some other disposition on the field be specified,\r\nthis Ordinary issues from the chief of the Shield. Examples: _Or, a Pile\r\ngu., between six and charged with three estoiles_ (or _mullets_)\r\n_counter-changed_,--for ROBERT DE CHANDOS, No. 126: _Or, three Piles\r\naz._, No. 127,--for Sir GUY DE BRIAN; _Or, three Piles gu., a canton\r\nerm._, No. 128,--for DE BASSETT (all H. 3): and (E. 2), _Arg., a Pile\r\nengrailed sa._--for Sir ROB. DE FORNEUS. In early emblazonments three\r\npiles appear almost uniformly to be depicted with the points converging.\r\nBut a distinction is now made, and when the piles are intended to\r\nconverge, as in No. 128, they are termed \"_in point_.\"\r\n\r\nThe probable structural origin of these Ordinaries is sufficiently\r\napparent to render any further comment on that interesting circumstance\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE GRAMMAR OF HERALDRY\r\n\r\nSECTION IV\r\n\r\n  _The Subordinaries:-- The Canton or Quarter: The Inescutcheon: The\r\n  Orle: The Tressure: The Bordure: Flanches: The Lozenge, Mascle, and\r\n  Rustre: The Fusil: The Billet: The Gyron: The Frette-- The Roundles._\r\n\r\n  \"The second in a line of stars.\"\r\n    --IDYLLS OF THE KING.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUBORDINARIES. This title has been assigned, but without any\r\ndecisive authority, to another group of devices, second in rank to the\r\nOrdinaries. Very few writers agree as to which are ordinaries and which\r\nsubordinaries; nor does there seem any reason why any distinction\r\nbetween them should exist. Nor, indeed, save that all are exclusively\r\nheraldic, why some of them should be regarded as anything more than\r\nordinary charges. These Subordinaries are the _Canton_, the _Quarter_,\r\nthe _Inescutcheon_, the _Orle_, the _Tressure_, the _Bordure_,\r\n_Flanches_, the _Lozenge_, _Mascle_ and _Rustre_, the _Fusil_, the\r\n_Billet_, the _Gyron_, and the _Frette_. The Canton, by the early\r\nHeralds commonly styled the \"Quarter,\" sometimes has been grouped with\r\nthe Ordinaries. And it must here be observed that the Lozenge, Fusil,\r\nBillet, Gyron, and Frette were not used as single charges by the early\r\nHeralds; but by them the fields of Shields were divided _lozengy_ and\r\n_gyronny_, or they were _semée of Billets_, or covered over with\r\n_Frette_-work, from which the single charges evidently were afterwards\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe CANTON (H. 3), sometimes blazoned as a QUARTER, cut off by two\r\nlines, the one drawn in pale and the other bar-wise, or in fesse, is\r\neither the first quarter of the field of a Shield, or about\r\nthree-fourths of that quarter, but smaller if not charged. The confusion\r\nbetween the canton and the quarter is due to the fact that ancient arms\r\nin which the charge is now, and has been for centuries past, stereotyped\r\nas a canton and drawn to occupy one-ninth of the Shield, were uniformly\r\ndrawn and blazoned in early times with the charge as a quarter. But\r\nthere is a marked distinction now made between the canton and the\r\nquarter. A _Canton ermine_ is of frequent occurrence, as in No. 128; but\r\nit is generally borne charged, and it always overlies the charges of the\r\nfield of the Shield, as No. 129, for DE KYRKEBY (R. 2)--_Arg., two bars\r\ngu.; on a canton of the last a cross moline or_; and, for BLUNDELL\r\n(H. 3)--_Az., billettée, on a canton or a raven ppr._, No. 130.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 129.--De Kyrkeby.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 130.--Blundell.]\r\n\r\nThe INESCUTCHEON (H. 3) is a Shield borne as a charge, and superimposed\r\nupon another Shield larger than itself. When one Inescutcheon is borne,\r\nit is usually placed on the fesse-point; but several Inescutcheons may\r\nappear in one composition. The well-known Shield of the MORTIMERS\r\nsupplies a good example, No. 131 (H. 3)--_Barry of six or and az., an\r\ninescutcheon arg.; on a chief gold, gyroned of the second, two pallets\r\nof the same_: for DARCY--_Arg., an inescutcheon sa., within an orle of\r\nroses gu._, No. 132 (E. 2): _Arg., three inescutcheons gu._, for DE\r\nWYLLERS (E. 2), No. 133. This is also the well-known Scottish coat of\r\nHay.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 132.--Darcy.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 131.--De Mortimer.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 133.--De Wyllers.]\r\n\r\nThe ORLE (H. 3), blazoned by early Heralds as a \"_false escutcheon_\"\r\n(\"_faux escocheon_\"), or as an \"_inescutcheon voided_,\" is the border of\r\na Shield or Escutcheon--a Shield, that is, voided of the central area of\r\nits field, and, like an Inescutcheon, charged on a Shield. The arms of\r\nBALLIOL, No. 134, are--_Gu., an Orle arg._ (H. 3). These arms are\r\nblazoned on many Scottish Seals of the greatest interest, and on the\r\nSeals of Balliol College, Oxford. Small charges are frequently disposed\r\nabout the border of a Shield \"_in Orle_,\" as in Nos. 86 and 132.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 134.--De Balliol.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 135.--Single Tressure Flory.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 137.--Double Tressure flory counterflory.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 136.--Single Tressure flory counterflory.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 138.--Scotland.]\r\n\r\nThe TRESSURE (H. 3) may be regarded as a variety of the Orle; indeed, in\r\nits simplest form it is a very narrow Orle, which is generally set round\r\nwith fleurs de lys. A Tressure thus enriched is represented in No. 135:\r\nin this example all the heads of the fleurs de lys point externally, and\r\nall their stalks internally, and this accordingly is blazoned as a\r\n\"_Tressure flory_.\" In No. 136, which, like No. 135, is a single\r\nTressure, the fleurs de lys are so disposed that the heads and stalks of\r\nthe flowers point alternately in contrary directions: this is blazoned\r\nas a \"_Tressure flory counterflory_.\" From this last example the\r\nTressure that is so well known in the blazonry of the Royal Shield of\r\nSCOTLAND differs, in being \"_double_.\" This, the double Tressure of\r\nScotland, is a combination of two such single Tressures as No. 136, and\r\nit is produced from them in the manner following:--From one such single\r\nTressure, as No. 136, all the alternate heads and stalks of the fleurs\r\nde lys that point internally are cut away and removed; then a second\r\nsimilar Tressure, of rather smaller size, is denuded of all its external\r\nadornment, and in that condition it is placed within the former\r\nTressure, leaving a narrow interval between the two. Each component half\r\nof this \"double Tressure flory counterflory,\" accordingly, has its own\r\nindependent series of demi-fleurs de lys, the stalks and heads of the\r\nflowers alternating, and the one alternate series pointing externally,\r\nwhile the other points internally. When in combination, these two series\r\nof demi-fleurs de lys must be so arranged that the heads of the flowers\r\nin one series correspond with their stalks in the other, as in No. 137.\r\nI am thus particular in describing the process of producing the Royal\r\nTressure, because it is frequently to be seen incorrectly drawn. No.\r\n138, the Royal Shield of SCOTLAND, now displayed in the second quarter\r\nof the Royal Arms of the UNITED KINGDOM, is thus blazoned--_Or, a lion\r\nrampt. within a double Tressure flory counterflory, gu._ It will be\r\nobserved that a narrow strip of the golden field of this Shield\r\nintervenes between the two Tressures. There are many fine examples of\r\nthis Shield in Scottish Seals; in the Garter-plate, also, of JAMES V. of\r\nScotland, K.G., at Windsor; and on the Monuments in Westminster Abbey to\r\nMARY Queen of SCOTS (A.D. 1604), and to the Countess of LENNOX, the\r\nmother of Lord DARNLEY (A.D. 1577). Mr. Seton (\"Scottish Heraldry,\" p.\r\n447) states that the Tressure may be borne \"triple\"; and, after\r\nspecifying the Scottish families upon whose Shields the same honourable\r\nbearing is blazoned, he adds:--\"In the coat of the Marquess of HUNTLY,\r\nthe Tressure is flowered with fleurs de lys within, and adorned with\r\n_crescents_ without; while in that of the Earl of ABERDEEN it is\r\nflowered and counter-flowered with _thistles_, _roses_, and fleurs de\r\nlys alternately.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 139.--De Waltone.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 140.--Richard, Earl of Cornwall.]\r\n\r\nThe BORDURE (H. 3), as its name implies, forms a border to a Shield: it\r\nis borne both plain and charged. Thus, for DE WALTONE (E. 2)--_Arg.,\r\na cross patée sa., within a Bordure indented gu._, No. 139: for RICHARD,\r\nEarl of CORNWALL, second son of King JOHN (H. 3),--_Arg., a lion rampt.\r\ngu., crowned or, within a Bordure sa. bezantée_, No. 140. The Bordure,\r\nand its important services in Heraldry, will be more fully considered\r\nhereafter. (See Chapters XII. and XIII.)\r\n\r\nFLANCHES are always borne in pairs; but they are not of very early date,\r\nnor do they often appear in blazon. _Flanches_ are formed by two curved\r\nlines issuing from the chief, one on each side of the Shield: they are\r\nshown, shaded for azure, in No. 141; and in No. 142 are their\r\nDiminutives, _Flasques_ or _Voiders_, shaded for gules. But these\r\ndiminutives are hardly ever met with. There is a close resemblance\r\nbetween these charges and a peculiar dress worn by Ladies of rank in the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries; but it is not easy to determine\r\nwhether the dress suggested the Flanches on the Shield, or was derived\r\nfrom them. One thing, however, is certain--the dress must have possessed\r\nvery decided good qualities, since it continued in favour for more than\r\ntwo centuries. It is remarkable that many of the ancient Greek Shields\r\nhave pierced Flanches.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 141.--Flanches.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 142.--Flasques.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 143.--Mascle.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 144.--Rustre.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 145.--De Burgh, Earl of Kent.]\r\n\r\nThe LOZENGE (E. 2), MASCLE (H. 3), and RUSTRE. The _Lozenge_ is a\r\ndiamond-shaped figure, or a parallelogram set diagonally. The _Mascle_\r\nis a _Lozenge voided of the field_, No. 143; and the _Rustre_, No. 144,\r\nis a _Lozenge pierced with a circular opening_. In the early days of\r\nHeraldry the Lozenge and the Mascle were evidently held to be identical.\r\nThe Shield of the famous HUBERT DE BURGH, Earl of KENT, in the early\r\nRolls is blazoned as \"_masculée_\": but his Seal proves it to have been,\r\nas in No. 145, _lozengy vair and gu._ The Lozenge, it will be\r\nremembered, is always set erect upon the field of a Shield.\r\n\r\nThe FUSIL is an _elongated Lozenge_. The Arms of MONTACUTE or MONTAGU\r\n(see No. 20) are--_Arg., three Fusils conjoined in fesse gu._, No. 20:\r\nthe Arms of PERCY are--_Az., five fusils conjoined in fesse or._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 20.--Montacute.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 146.--Deincourt.]\r\n\r\nThe BILLET (H. 3) is a small elongated rectangular figure. Thus, for\r\nDEINCOURT, No. 146--_Az., billettée, a fesse dancette or._ The early\r\nHeralds blazoned a \"Fesse Dancette\" as simply a \"_Dancette_\" or\r\n\"_Danse_.\" See also No. 130.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 147.--Campbell.]\r\n\r\nThe GYRON, a triangular figure, not known in English blazon as a\r\nseparate charge (except perhaps in the one case of the arms of\r\nMortimer), gives its title to the _gyronny field_, which is more\r\ncommonly found in the Heraldry of the North than of the South. The field\r\ngyronny generally, and more particularly in Scotland, is divided into\r\n_eight pieces_: but the divisions are sometimes six, ten, twelve, or\r\neven sixteen in number. A Roll of the time of HENRY III. has, for WARIN\r\nDE BASINGBORNE--\"_Gerony d'or et d'azur_.\" The Arms of CAMPBELL\r\nare--_Gyronny or and sa._, No. 147.[3] Here, where there are eight\r\npieces of divisions, it is not necessary to specify the number; but if\r\nthey were either more or less than eight the blazon would be--_gyronny\r\nof six, of ten, &c._\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: In the illustration the colours are unfortunately\r\n    reversed.]\r\n\r\nThe FRETTE, in more recent Heraldry, has generally superseded the\r\noriginal _field fretty_. This interlaced design, whether borne as a\r\ndistinct figure, as No. 148, or repeated over the field of a Shield, as\r\nin No. 149, differs from a field lozengy or gyronny, in being a bearing\r\ncharged _upon_ the field of a Shield, and not a form of varied surface:\r\nNo. 149, for DE ETCHINGHAM (E. 2), is--_Az., fretty arg._ An early\r\nvariety or modification of Frette is the _Trellis_ or _Treille_, in\r\nwhich the pieces do not interlace, but all those in bend lie over all\r\nthose in bend sinister, and they are fastened at the crossings with\r\nnails--\"_clouée_,\" as in No. 150. RICHARD DE TRUSSELL or TRESSELL (H. 3)\r\nbears--_Arg., a trellis gu., clouée or_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 148.--A Frette.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 149.--De Etchingham.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 150.--Trellis Clouée.]\r\n\r\nThe ROUNDLES, or ROUNDLETS. These simple figures, in constant use in\r\nevery age of Heraldry, are divided into two groups, which correspond\r\nwith the division of the Tinctures into \"Metals\" and \"Colours.\"\r\n\r\nThe first group contains the two Roundles of the _Metals_, which are\r\n_flat discs_: 1, The _Bezant_, or golden Roundle, No. 151, which has\r\napparently derived its name from the Byzantine coins with which the\r\nCrusaders, when in the East, would have been familiar. 2, The Silver\r\nRoundle, or _Plate_, is from the Spanish \"Plata\"--_silver_. When Bezants\r\nor Plates appear in considerable numbers, the field on which they are\r\ncharged is said to be \"_bezantée_\" or \"_platée_.\" See No. 140.\r\n\r\nThe second group contains the five Roundles of the _Colours_, which are\r\n_globular_, and are usually shaded accordingly. The _Torteau_, No. 152,\r\nin the plural _Torteaux_, is gules: the _Hurt_ is azure: the _Pellet_ or\r\n_Ogress_ is sable: the _Pomme_ is vert: and the _Golpe_ is purpure.\r\nThese distinctive titles, which are more calculated to perplex the\r\nstudent than to simplify his study, are of comparatively recent origin,\r\nthe early Heralds having used the terms \"_Bezant_,\" \"_Plate_,\" and\r\n\"_Torteau_,\" with the general designations \"_Roundle_\" and \"_Pellet_,\"\r\nadding the tinctures for the others. Examples:--_Az., bezantée_, for WM.\r\nDE LA ZOUCHE: _Or, on a fesse gu. three plates_, for ROGER DE\r\nHUNTINGFIELD: _Arg., ten torteaux, four, three, two, one_, for ALEX.\r\nGIFFARD (all H. 3). See also Nos. 80, 82.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 151.--Bezant.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 152.--Torteau.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 153.--Fountain.]\r\n\r\nA circular figure or Roundle that is _barry wavy arg. and az._, is\r\nblazoned as a \"_Fountain_,\" No. 153. Examples:--_Arg., three fountains_,\r\nfor WELLES: _Arg., a Chevron sable between three fountains_, borne by a\r\nfamily named _Sykes_, their name being an ancient term signifying a well\r\nor fountain. An _Annulet_, or a plain ring, No. 154, was sometimes\r\nblazoned as a \"_false Roundle_\"--a Roundle, that is, pierced, and having\r\nits central area removed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 154.--Annulet.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE GRAMMAR OF HERALDRY\r\n\r\nSECTION V\r\n\r\n  _Miscellaneous Charges:-- Human Beings-- Animals-- Birds-- Fish--\r\n  Reptiles and Insects-- Imaginary Beings-- Natural Objects-- Various\r\n  Artificial Figures and Devices-- Appropriate Descriptive Epithets._\r\n\r\n  \"The Formes of pure celestiall bodies mixt with grosse terrestrials;\r\n  earthly animals with watery; sauage beasts with tame; fowles of prey\r\n  with home-bred; these again with riuer fowles; reptiles with things\r\n  gressible; aery insecta with earthly; also things naturall with\r\n  artificiall.\"\r\n    --GUILLIM'S \"Display of Heraldry,\" A.D. 1611.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, in his own quaint fashion, the enthusiastic old Herald of the\r\nseventeenth century indicates the number and variety of the Charges,\r\nwhich in process of time had been introduced into Armory even before his\r\nera. In earlier days the Charges of Heraldry were much less varied,\r\ncomparatively few in their numbers, and generally of a simple character.\r\nIt will readily be understood, however, that fresh figures and devices\r\nwould continually appear in blazon; and also that these, in their turn,\r\nwould lead the way for the introduction of further varieties and new\r\nmodifications.\r\n\r\nHuman Beings are of very rare occurrence, except as Supporters. Parts of\r\nthe human frame constantly appear, but they are more generally borne as\r\nCrests upon helms than as charges on shields. \"Moor's heads\" or\r\n\"Saracen's heads\" appear in some coats, with arms, hands and legs: and a\r\nhuman heart is well known as a charge in the coat of the famous house of\r\nDOUGLAS, where it was placed to commemorate the duty entrusted by ROBERT\r\nBRUCE to the \"good Sir JAMES DOUGLAS,\" that he should bear with him the\r\nheart of his Sovereign and friend to the Holy Land, and bury it there.\r\nSir James fell, fighting with the Moors of Spain, A.D. 1330. This Shield\r\nof Douglas is a characteristic example of the gradual development of\r\narmorial composition. About A.D. 1290, the Seal of WILLIAM, Lord\r\nDOUGLAS, displays his Shield, No. 155, bearing--_Arg., on a chief az.\r\nthree mullets of the field._ Next, upon the field of the Shield of\r\nWILLIAM, Lord DOUGLAS, A.D. 1333, there appears, in addition, _a human\r\nheart gules_, as in No. 156. And, finally, the heart is ensigned with a\r\n_royal crown_, as in No. 157, this form appearing as early as 1387.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 155.--Shield of Douglas.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 156.--Shield of Douglas.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 157.--Shield of Douglas.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 158.--Isle of Man.]\r\n\r\nThe Shield of the ancient kingdom of the ISLE OF MAN, No. 158, still\r\ncontinues to be the heraldic ensign of that island: it is--_Gu., three\r\nhuman legs in armour ppr., conjoined in the fesse-point at the upper\r\npart of the thighs, and flexed in triangle._ This true curiosity of\r\nHeraldry leads Mr. Planché to remark, that \"the _arms_ of MAN are\r\n_legs_\" (\"Pursuivant of Arms,\" p. 112). The Shield represented in No.\r\n158 is drawn from an original example of the age of EDWARD I. in the\r\nHeralds' College. At later periods, the armour of the conjoined limbs is\r\nrepresented in conformity with the usages then prevalent, and golden\r\nspurs are added. The ancient symbol of the island of Sicily, in which\r\nthe limbs are without either armour or clothing, has been represented in\r\nNo. 10: this device also appears in ancient examples with a human head\r\nat the junction of the limbs. Three human arms, united in the same\r\nmanner, are borne on the shield of the mediæval family of TREMAINE.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 159.--Shield of St. Alban's Abbey\r\n  (partly restored).]\r\n\r\nHuman figures, winged and vested, and designed to represent ANGELS, are\r\noccasionally introduced in English Heraldry, their office generally\r\nbeing to act as \"Supporters\" to armorial Shields. Fine examples, in\r\nadmirable preservation, may be seen boldly sculptured in the noble\r\ntimber-roof of Westminster Hall; also in panels over the principal\r\nentrance to the Hall, and in various parts of the Abbey of Westminster.\r\nIn the grand Abbey Church of St. Alban at St. Alban's, numerous other\r\nexamples of great excellence yet remain, the works of Abbot John de\r\nWheathamstede, about A.D. 1440. In No. 159 I give a representation of\r\nthe Shield of Arms of the Abbey of ST. ALBAN--_Az., a saltire or_,\r\nsupported by Angels, and the Shield ensigned by the Mitre of Abbot\r\nThomas De la Mere, as it is represented in his noble Brass in the Abbey\r\nChurch. The Shield and the Angel Figures are the work of Abbot John. The\r\nHeads of the Figures, which are destroyed in the original, are restored\r\nfrom stained glass of the same period in the Abbey Church. Figures of\r\nAngels holding Shields of Arms--each figure having a shield in front of\r\nits breast, are frequently sculptured as corbels in Gothic churches.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest Rolls of Arms, the Lion is the only animal that is found\r\nin blazon, with the sole addition of Boar's heads. Deer, dogs, bulls,\r\ncalves, rams, and a few other animals subsequently appear to share\r\nheraldic service and honours with the king of beasts. In modern Armory,\r\nhowever, almost every living creature has been required to discharge\r\nsuch duties as Heralds have been pleased to assign to them. The Lion of\r\nHeraldry I leave to be considered, with the Eagle, in the next Chapter.\r\nIn comparatively early blazon, the _Bear_ is borne by FITZ URSE: the\r\n_Calf_, by CALVELEY and DE VELE: the _Ram_, by RAMSEY and RAMRYGE: the\r\n_Lamb_, by LAMBERT and LAMBTON: the _Otter_ (_loutre_, in French), by\r\nLUTTREL: the _Hedgehog_ (Fr., _herrison_), by DE HERIZ, afterwards\r\nHARRIS: and so also, in like manner, some other animals appear as _armes\r\nparlantes_ (see p. 16).\r\n\r\nWith the lordly Eagle a few other Birds are associated in early\r\nHeraldry: and, after a while, others join them, including the Falcon,\r\nOstrich, Swan, Peacock or Pawne, and the Pelican borne both as a symbol\r\nof sacred significance, and also by the PELHAMS from being allusive to\r\ntheir name. Cocks, with the same allusive motive, were borne by\r\nCOCKAYNE: Parrots, blazoned as \"_Popinjays_,\" appear as early as\r\nHENRY III.: and in a Roll of EDWARD II., the Sire MOUNPYNZON has a Lion\r\ncharged on the shoulder with a Chaffinch--in French a _Pinson_. The\r\nfavourite bird, however, of the early Heralds is the Martlet, the\r\nheraldic Martin, a near relative of the Swallow or _Hirondelle_. The\r\nMartlet is practically always represented in profile, at rest, and with\r\nits wings closed. The few exceptions are modern. In some early examples\r\nthe feet are shown, as in No. 160: but, in the Shield of Earl WM. DE\r\nVALENCE in Westminster Abbey, A.D. 1296, the Martlet appears feetless,\r\nas in No. 161; and at a later period this mode of representation was\r\ngenerally adopted. French Heralds deprive their Martlets of beak as well\r\nas feet.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 160.--Early Martlet.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 161.--Martlet.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 162.--Banner of De Barre.]\r\n\r\n\"As the symbol of a name,\" writes Mr. Moule, \"almost all Fish have been\r\nused in Heraldry; and in many instances Fish have been assumed in Arms\r\nin reference to the produce of the estate, giving to the quaint device a\r\ntwofold interest\" (\"Heraldry of Fish,\" p 13). The earliest examples are\r\nthe Barbel, the Dolphin, the Luce (or Pike), the Herring, and the Roach.\r\nIn conjunction with fish we may perhaps consider the Escallop which, as\r\na charge, belongs to the earliest period of Heraldry. The Barbel, so\r\nnamed from the barbs attached to its mouth to assist it in its search\r\nfor food, was introduced into English Heraldry by JOHN, Count DE BARRE,\r\nwhose elder brother married ALIANORE, eldest daughter of EDWARD I. At\r\nCarlaverock he displayed, as the chronicler has recorded, \"_a blue\r\nbanner, crusilly, with two Barbels of gold, and a red border\r\nen-grailed_,\" No. 162. The Dolphin, borne by GILES DE FISHBOURNE (H. 3),\r\nand afterwards introduced into several English Shields, is best known as\r\nthe armorial ensign of the DAUPHIN, the eldest son and heir apparent of\r\nthe Kings of France, who bore, marshalled with the arms of FRANCE--_Or,\r\na Dolphin az._ This title of \"Dauphin\" was first assumed by CHARLES V.,\r\nwho succeeded to the Crown of France in 1364. In No. 8 I have shown\r\nafter what manner the Dolphin was represented by an ancient Greek\r\nArtist: in the Middle Ages the heraldic Dolphin appeared as in No. 163.\r\nGEFFREY DE LUCY (H. 3) bears--_Gu., three Lucies or._ On his marriage\r\nwith the heiress of ANTHONY, Lord LUCY, in 1369, HENRY, fourth Lord\r\nPERCY of Alnwick, quartered these three fish, with his own lion (blue on\r\na golden field) and his fusils (gold on a blue field), upon the\r\nwell-known Shield of the Earls of NORTHUMBERLAND (Chapter XI).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 163.--Dolphin.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 165.--Escallop.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 164.--De Lucy.]\r\n\r\nAnother Carlaverock Banneret, ROBERT DE SCALES, whom the chronicler\r\ndeclares to have been both \"handsome and amiable\" as well as gallant in\r\naction, had \"_six escallops of silver on a red banner_.\" This beautiful\r\ncharge of the escallop, happy in its association with the pilgrims of\r\nthe olden time, and always held in high esteem by Heralds, is generally\r\ndrawn as in No. 165.\r\n\r\nReptiles and Insects occur but rarely in English Heraldry. Bees, Flies,\r\nButterflies, and Snails are sometimes found, but they have no place in\r\nthe earliest Rolls of Arms. Bees, as might be expected, appear in the\r\nArms of _Bees_ton. _Azure, three Butterflies_, are the Arms of MUSCHAMP,\r\nand they are carved twice in the vaulting of the cloisters at\r\nCanterbury. Upon a monumental brass in the Church of Wheathampstead, in\r\nHertfordshire, the Shield of HUGO BOSTOCK (about A.D. 1435)\r\nbears,--_Arg., three Bats, their wings displayed, sa._\r\n\r\nImaginary and Fabulous Beings, some of them the creations of heraldic\r\nfancy when in a strangely eccentric mood, frequently appear as\r\nSupporters; and, in some cases, they take a part in the blazonry of\r\nShields, or they are borne independently as Badges. A very brief\r\ndescription (all that is necessary) of the greater number of these\r\nmonsters of _un_natural history will be given in the \"Glossary of\r\nheraldic terms,\" in Chapter X.; consequently, it is enough here merely\r\nto refer to them as having a place in blazon. The Griffin or Gryphon,\r\nthe most worthy of the group, is comparatively common. The Dragon and\r\nthe Wivern or Wyvern, both of them winged monsters, differ in this\r\nrespect, that the former has four legs, while the latter has two only.\r\nIn early blazon this distinction was not always observed. The\r\nCockatrice, always having two legs, is a Wyvern with a cock's head.\r\n\r\nNatural Objects of all kinds are blazoned as Charges of Heraldry, and\r\nthey will be found described and illustrated in their proper places in\r\nChapter X. They include the _Sun_, the _Moon_, the _Stars_; also such\r\nterrestrial objects as _Trees_, _Flowers_, _Fruits_, _Sheaves and Ears\r\nof Corn_, _Leaves_, _Chaplets_, _&c._ And with these Charges I may group\r\nthe always beautiful Fleur de Lys, and the Trefoil, Quatrefoil,\r\nCinquefoil, and Sixfoil.\r\n\r\nOf the various Artificial Figures and Devices that Heralds have charged\r\nupon Shields of Arms, it will be unnecessary for me to give detailed\r\ndescriptions, except when either the heraldic name may require\r\nexplanation, or some special circumstances connected with any particular\r\nfigure or device may impart to it peculiar claims for attention. Again I\r\nrefer to the \"Glossary\" for notices and examples of all Charges of this\r\nclass--Annulets, Buckles, Castles, Crowns, Cups, Horseshoes, Keys,\r\nKnots, Sickles, Stirrups, Trumpets, and many others.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 166A.--Crescent]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 166B.--Increscent]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 166C.--Decrescent]\r\n\r\nIn blazoning Charges of various classes, Heralds employ _appropriate\r\nEpithets and descriptive Terms_, of which the following are\r\ncharacteristic examples:--The _Sun_ is \"_in splendour_.\" The _Moon_,\r\nwhen full, is \"_in her complement_\": she is a \"_Crescent_\" when she\r\nappears in No. 166, A: she is \"_Increscent_\" when as in No. 166, B: and\r\nshe is \"_Decrescent_\" when as in No. 166, C. Animals and Birds of prey\r\nare said to be \"_armed_\" of their talons, teeth, and claws. All horned\r\nanimals, also, except Stags and Antelopes, are \"_armed_\" of their horns;\r\nand a Cock is \"_armed_\" of his spurs; whilst Griffins and birds of prey\r\nare \"_armed_\" of their beaks and claws (_i.e._ the part of the leg which\r\nis unfeathered). Animals are \"_hoofed_\" or \"_unguled_\" of their hoofs;\r\nand \"_langued_\" of their tongues. Fierce animals are \"_vorant_\" of their\r\nprey, when represented in the act of devouring it. Deer, when reposing,\r\nare \"_lodged_\" Nos. 25 and 26: when standing, and looking out from the\r\nShield, No. 167, \"_at gaze_\": when in easy motion, they are termed\r\n\"_trippant_,\" or sometimes the word \"_tripping_\" is substituted, No.\r\n168: and when in rapid motion, they are \"_courant_,\" \"_at speed_,\" or\r\nsometimes described as \"_in full course_,\" No. 169. The male Stag is\r\nsometimes termed a \"_Hart_,\" and the female a \"_Hind_.\" There is really\r\na distinction between the Buck and the Stag, but it is very usually\r\ndisregarded in Heraldry. The antlers of the Hart are \"_Attires_,\" their\r\nbranches are \"_Tynes_\"; and they are said to be \"_attired_\" of their\r\nantlers. A Stag's head full-faced, but without the neck, as No. 170, is\r\n\"_cabossed_\" or \"_caboshed_.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 167.--At Gaze.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 169.--At Speed.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 168.--Tripping.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 170.--Stag's Head Cabossed.]\r\n\r\nEagles and Hawks with expanded wings, as in No. 206, are \"_displayed_.\"\r\nExpanded wings may be \"_elevated_,\" or, if drooping, \"_inverted_\" or\r\n\"_in lure_.\" Birds about to take wing are \"_rising_\"; when in flight,\r\nthey are \"_volant_\"; when at rest, they are \"_close_.\" A Bird\r\n\"_trusses_\" its prey. A Peacock having its tail expanded is \"_in its\r\npride_\"; and this same expression is applied to the Turkey. A Pelican,\r\nwhen feeding its young, is said to be \"_in her piety_,\" but may be\r\nmerely \"_vulning herself_\" if the young are not represented. A Swan,\r\nwhen blazoned \"_proper_,\" is white with red legs and black beak.\r\n\r\nFish, represented swimming in fesse, are \"_naiant_\"; if they are in\r\npale, they are \"_hauriant_,\" No. 164; but if their heads are to the\r\nbase, the term \"_urinant_\" is said to apply, but I cannot say I have so\r\nfar come across an authenticated instance of the use of this word; if\r\ntheir bodies are bent, as the Dolphin is generally represented, they are\r\n\"_embowed_,\" No. 163. Fish, also, are said to be \"_finned_\" of their\r\nfins. Insects are \"_volant_.\" Reptiles are \"_gliding_\"; or, if they are\r\ntwined into knots, \"_nowed_.\" Trees of mature growth are \"_accrued_\";\r\nwhen with leaves, \"_in foliage_\" (but these two terms are so seldom used\r\nthat they may be entirely disregarded); with fruit or seeds, \"_fructed_\"\r\nor \"_seeded_\"; if without leaves, \"_blasted_\"; and if their roots are\r\nexposed, \"_eradicated_.\" Branches or leaves torn off are \"_slipped_.\"\r\n\r\nThe terms which denote the attitudes of Lions, all of them described in\r\nthe next chapter, are equally applicable to other animals. Some other\r\ndescriptive terms, not noticed here, will be found in the \"Glossary\" in\r\nChapter X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE GRAMMAR OF HERALDRY\r\n\r\nSECTION VI\r\n\r\n  _The Lion and the Eagle in Heraldry_\r\n\r\n  \"The LION and a King of Beasts.\"\r\n    --SHAKESPEARE, _Richard II._\r\n\r\n  \"The EAGLE, ennobled by Nature in as high a degree of nobility as\r\n  the chiefest of the terrestrial animals, is the most honourable\r\n  bearing of Birds.\"\r\n    --GWILLIM (_Edition of 1724_).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe regal dignity of the LION amongst the creatures that are quadrupeds,\r\nlike himself, would naturally secure for him a position of corresponding\r\neminence in Heraldry. From the dawn of the heraldic era, accordingly,\r\nthe Lion is blazoned on the Shields of Sovereigns, Princes, and Nobles.\r\nThe tressured Lion has been already noticed upon the Royal Shield of\r\nSCOTLAND, No. 138; and a crowned Lion has also appeared in the same\r\nattitude, borne by an English Prince, RICHARD, Earl of CORNWALL, No.\r\n140. From the time that they first possessed any true armorial insignia,\r\nthe Sovereigns of the Realm of ENGLAND have borne Lions upon their Royal\r\nShield. A Lion was the Ensign of the Native Princes of WALES, as he was\r\nof the Kings of LEON, of NORWAY, and of DENMARK, and of the Counts of\r\nHOLLAND, HAINAULT, EU, &c. And, in like manner, the Lion was in high\r\nfavour with the most noble and powerful Barons of England--the MOWBRAYS,\r\nBOHUNS, LONGESPEES, FITZ-ALANS, LACIES, PERCIES, SEGRAVES, and such as\r\nthey.\r\n\r\nIt was a necessary consequence of his great popularity that the Lion of\r\nHeraldry should be blazoned in various attitudes, and also variously\r\ntinctured, otherwise it would not be possible duly to distinguish the\r\nLions of different Shields. Heralds of all countries appear readily to\r\nhave permitted their Lions to lay aside their natural tawny hue, and in\r\nits stead to assume the heraldic _or_, _argent_, _azure_, _gules_, and\r\n_sable_; but Continental Heralds were not generally disposed to\r\nrecognise in their Lions any other attitude than the one which they held\r\nto be consistent with their Lion character, instincts, and\r\nhabits--erect, that is, with one hind paw only on the ground, looking\r\nforward towards their prey, so as to show but one eye, and evidently in\r\nthe act of preparing to spring. This undoubtedly most characteristic\r\nattitude is _rampant_, No. 171: and only when he was in this rampant\r\nattitude did the early Heralds consider any Lion to be a Lion, and\r\nblazon him by his true name. A Lion walking and looking about him, the\r\nearly Heralds held to be acting the part of a leopard: consequently,\r\nwhen he was in any such attitude, they blazoned him as \"_a leopard_.\"\r\nThe animal bearing that name bore it simply as an heraldic title, which\r\ndistinguished a Lion in a particular attitude. These heraldic \"leopards\"\r\nwere drawn in every respect as other heraldic \"lions,\" without spots or\r\nany leopard_ish_ distinction whatever. This explains the usage, retained\r\ntill late in the fourteenth century, which assigned to the Lions of the\r\nRoyal Shield of England the name of \"leopards.\" They were so called, not\r\nby the enemies of England for derision and insult, as some persons, in\r\ntheir ignorance of early Heraldry, have been pleased both to imagine and\r\nto assert; but the English Kings and Princes, who well knew their\r\n\"Lions\" to be Lions, in blazon styled them \"leopards,\" because they also\r\nknew that Lions in the attitude of their \"Lions\" were heraldic\r\n\"leopards.\" When at length the necessity of varying the attitude of\r\ntheir Lions was admitted by all Heralds, in consequence of the greatly\r\nincreased numbers of the bearers of Lions, some strict adherents to the\r\noriginal distinctive nomenclature blazoned any Lion that was _not\r\nrampant_ by the compound term of a \"_lion-leopard_,\" or a\r\n\"_lion-leopardé_.\" But that controversy has long been at rest.\r\n\r\nThe following terms are now in use to denote the various attitudes of\r\nthe Lion in Heraldry:--\r\n\r\n_Rampant_: erect, one hind paw on the ground, the other three paws\r\nelevated, the animal looking forward and having his tail elevated, No.\r\n171. _Rampant Guardant_: as before, but looking out from the Shield, No.\r\n172. _Rampant Reguardant_: as before, but looking backwards.\r\n\r\n_Passant_: walking, three paws on the ground, the dexter fore-paw being\r\nelevated, looking forward, the tail displayed over the back, No. 173.\r\n_Passant Guardant_: as before, but looking out from the Shield, No. 174.\r\n_Passant Reguardant_: as before, but looking backwards.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 171.--Rampant.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 172.--Rampant Guardant.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 173.--Passant.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 174.--Passant Guardant.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 175.--Statant.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 176.--Statant Guardant.]\r\n\r\n_Statant_: standing, his four paws on the ground, and looking before\r\nhim, No. 175. _Statant Guardant_: as before, but looking out from the\r\nShield, No. 176: in this example the Lion has his tail extended, but\r\nthis would be specified in the blazon, as it is an unusual position. In\r\nlike manner, if the tail of a Lion in any other attitude be extended,\r\nthere must be a statement to that effect.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 177.--Couchant.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 178.--Sejant.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 179.--Dormant.]\r\n\r\n_Sejant_: sitting down with his head elevated, No. 178. If he looks out\r\nfrom the Shield, the word _Guardant_ is to be added. A Scottish Lion\r\nsejant usually has his fore paws raised in the air, and in English terms\r\nof blazon would be described as \"_Sejant erect_\" or \"_Sejant rampant_.\"\r\n\r\n_Couchant_: is at rest, the fore legs stretched on the ground, as No.\r\n177.\r\n\r\n_Dormant_: asleep, head resting on fore paws, No. 179.\r\n\r\n_Salient_: in the act of springing, the hind paws on the ground, both\r\nthe fore paws elevated, No. 180.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 180.--Salient.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 181.--Double-queued.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 182.--Coward.]\r\n\r\n_Queue fourchée_: having a forked tail.\r\n\r\n_Double-queued_: two tails, as No. 181, which is a _lion rampant\r\ndouble-queued_.\r\n\r\n_Coward: passant reguardant_, his tail between his legs, No. 182.\r\n\r\nTwo Lions rampant, when face to face, are _Counter rampant_, or\r\n_Combatant_: when back to back, they are _Addorsed_: when passant or\r\nsalient in contrary directions, they are _Counter passant_ or _Counter\r\nsalient_.\r\n\r\nLions, whatever their tincture, except it be red, or they are charged on\r\na field of that tincture, are _armed and langued gules_; but _azure_ in\r\nthe case of either of these exceptions, unless the contrary be specified\r\nin the blazon. When several Lions appear in one composition, or when\r\nthey are drawn to a comparatively very small scale, they are sometimes\r\nblazoned as \"_Lioncels_.\" This term \"_Lioncel_,\" it must be added, when\r\nused alone, denotes a _small Lion rampant_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 183.--Lion's Head.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 184.--Lion's Face.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 185.--Lion's Jambe.]\r\n\r\nA Lion's _head_ is a Charge: it may be _erased_, as in No. 183; or cut\r\noff smooth, when it is _couped_. A Lion's _face_ also is a Charge, No.\r\n184; so is his _jambe_ or _paw_, No. 185. A _demi-lion rampant_ is the\r\nupper half of his body and the extremity of his tufted tail, as in No.\r\n186.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 186.--Demi-Lion Rampant.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 187.--England.]\r\n\r\nThe LIONS OF ENGLAND are _golden Lions leopardé_, three in number,\r\nplaced one above the other on a red Shield. They are blazoned--_Gu.,\r\nthree Lions pass. guard., in pale, or_, No. 187.\r\n\r\nA Lion in this attitude, of this tincture, and on a field gules, may be\r\nblazoned as a \"Lion of England.\" These three Lions _first_ appear upon\r\nthe second Great Seal of RICHARD I., A.D. 1194, on the Shield of the\r\nKing, No. 188. An earlier Seal, used by Prince JOHN before his brother's\r\naccession, has a Shield charged with _two_ Lions only, and they are\r\n_passant_, No. 189. The first Great Seal of the lion-hearted King has a\r\nShield, bowed in its contour, and charged with a _single_ Lion rampant\r\nfacing to the sinister, or _counter-rampant_, No. 190; and it has been\r\nconjectured that, were the whole face of this Shield visible, a second\r\nLion rampant facing to the dexter would appear, thus charging the Shield\r\nwith _two Lions combattant_; this, however, is a conjecture which is not\r\nsupported by the authority of many Shields of the same form. A red\r\nShield charged with _two golden Lions passant guardant in pale_ (No.\r\n22), and therefore closely resembling No. 189, as I have already shown,\r\nhas been assigned to WILLIAM I., and his two sons and his grandson,\r\nWILLIAM II., HENRY I., and STEPHEN. The Shield bearing the three Lions,\r\nNo. 187, has been assigned to HENRY II., but it first makes its\r\nappearance on the Great Seal of his son. The probability is that up to\r\nthis period the device was simply a lion, indeterminate in position or\r\nnumbers. This same Shield has continued, from the time of RICHARD I., to\r\ndisplay the ROYAL ARMS of the REALM OF ENGLAND: how, in the course of\r\nages, these Arms become grouped with other insignia, I shall presently\r\nhave to show.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 188.--Richard I.--2nd Gt. Seal.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 190.--Richard I.--1st Gt. Seal.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 189.--Prince John.--Seal.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 191.--Le Strange.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 192.--Giffard.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 193.--Mowbray.]\r\n\r\nThe _Lion passant_ is carefully distinguished in the earliest Rolls as a\r\ndifferent Charge from the _Lion passant guardant_. Thus (H. 3), for\r\nHAMON LE STRANGE--_Gu., two Lions passant arg._, No. 191; and for JOHN\r\nGIFFARD--_Gu., three Lions pass. arg._, No. 192: for Sir NICHOLAS CAREW\r\n(E. 2),--_Or, three Lions pass. sa._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 194.--De Lacy.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 195.--De Segrave.]\r\n\r\nFrom the numerous early Shields which bear _Lions rampant_, I select the\r\nfollowing examples, associated with names illustrious in English\r\nHistory. For ROGER DE MOWBRAY (H. 3)--_Gu., a Lion rampt. arg._, No.\r\n193: this Coat is quartered by the present Lord MOWBRAY, SEGRAVE and\r\nSTOURTON. For FITZ-ALAN, Earl of ARUNDEL--_Gu., a Lion rampt. or_\r\n(H. 3), No. 193. For DE LACI, Earl of LINCOLN--_Or, a Lion rampt.\r\npurpure_ (E. 2), No. 194. For Sir JOHN DE SEGRAVE (E. 2)--_Sa., a Lion\r\nrampt. arg., crowned or_, No. 195. For PERCY, Earl of\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND--_Or, a Lion rampt. az._, No 196: this Shield is drawn\r\nfrom the fine counter-seal of Sir HENRY DE PERCY, first Lord of Alnwick,\r\nwho died A.D. 1315.\r\n\r\nTwo Shields of the DE BOHUNS, Nos. 114, 115, already described,\r\nexemplify the display of Lioncels as heraldic charges. An earlier\r\nShield, charged with six Lioncels, but without any Ordinary, was borne\r\nby FAIR ROSAMOND'S son, WILLIAM LONGESPÉE, Earl of SALISBURY, A.D. 1226:\r\nit is boldly sculptured with his noble effigy in Salisbury Cathedral,\r\nand it also appears upon his Seal--_Az., six Lioncels or_, No. 197. The\r\nRoll of Edward II., confirmed by his Seal, gives for Sir WM. DE\r\nLEYBOURNE the same composition, with a difference in the\r\ntincturing--_Az., six Lioncels arg._ Other members of the same family\r\nchange these tinctures for _gules and or_, _gules and argent_, and _or\r\nand sable_ (E. 2). Examples of Shields which bear Lions or Lioncels with\r\nvarious other charges will be described and illustrated in succeeding\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 196.--De Percy.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 197.--Longespée.]\r\n\r\nLions also fulfil important duties of high honour in English Heraldry as\r\n_Crests_ and _Supporters_, and also as _Badges_. From the time of\r\nEDWARD III. a Crowned Lion, at the first standing on a Cap of Estate,\r\nand afterwards upon the Crown, has been the Royal Crest of ENGLAND;\r\na Lion also has always been the Royal Crest of SCOTLAND (see Chapter\r\nXVIII.). The Princes of the Royal Houses of England, in like manner,\r\nhave always borne the Royal Lion distinguished by some \"Mark of Cadency\"\r\n(see Chapter XII.): No. 198 is the Lion Crest of the BLACK PRINCE, from\r\nhis Monument at Canterbury, the Lion differenced with the Prince's\r\nsilver label. The Lion also appears as the Crest of many noble and\r\ndistinguished families, as the DE BOHUNS, the PERCIES, and the HOWARDS.\r\nThe Lion Crest of RICHARD II., sculptured _statant guardant_ upon his\r\nhelm, with a chapeau and mantling, and with the Badge of two Ostrich\r\nfeathers, in Westminster Hall, is without any crown: No. 199.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 198.--Crest of Black Prince.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 199.--Crest of Richard II.]\r\n\r\nAs a Royal Supporter of the Arms of _England_, the Lion appears in\r\ncompany with some other creature from the time of HENRY VI., EDWARD IV.\r\nsometimes having his Shield supported by two Lions. On the accession of\r\nJAMES I. of Great Britain, the Royal Lion Supporter formed that alliance\r\nwith the Unicorn of Scotland which still continues, and will continue,\r\nit is to be hoped, throughout all time. Lions, as I shall point out more\r\nin detail in Chapter XVI., were frequently introduced into the\r\ncomposition of Seals before true heraldic Supporters were in use. In\r\nmore recent Heraldry the Lion is a favourite Supporter: he now appears\r\nsupporting the Shields of the Dukes of NORFOLK, ARGYLL, ATHOLL, BEDFORD,\r\nGRAFTON, NORTHUMBERLAND, PORTLAND, and WELLINGTON; also, with many\r\nothers, those of the Marquesses of BATH, EXETER, HEADFORT, and\r\nSALISBURY; of the Earls of ALBEMARLE, BROWNLOW, CARLISLE, CARNARVON,\r\nCORK, ESSEX, and HARDWICK; of the Viscount HARDINGE; and of the Barons\r\nARUNDEL, CAMOYS, DUNBOYNE, MONSON, MOWBRAY, PETRE, and SOUTHAMPTON. As a\r\nSupporter the Lion is represented _rampant_, _rampant reguardant_, and\r\n_sejant rampant_. Lions also, and Demi-Lions, are frequently borne as\r\nmodern Crests.\r\n\r\nIn our own treatment of the Lions of Heraldry, whatever their attitude\r\nor tincture, whatever also the position they may occupy or the heraldic\r\nduty they may discharge, we are always to draw and to blazon them as\r\ntrue _heraldic Lions_, while, at the same time, in their expression and\r\ngeneral characteristics they are to be _genuine Lions_.\r\n\r\nIn becoming fellowship with the Lion, the EAGLE appears in the earliest\r\nEnglish Rolls and examples of Arms. The Royal bird, however, does not\r\noccur in English blazon so frequently as the Lion; and his appearance\r\noften denotes an alliance with German Princes. A Roll of Arms (printed\r\nin \"Archæologia,\" XXX.) of the year 1275 commences with the Shields of\r\nthe \"EMPEROR OF GERMANY,\" and of the \"KING OF GERMANY,\" which are\r\nseverally blazoned as,--\"_Or, an Eagle displayed having two heads sa._,\"\r\nand, \"_Or, an Eagle displayed sable_.\" In York Cathedral, in stained\r\nglass, there are Shields with both the double-headed and the\r\nsingle-headed Eagles, all of them German, which may be considered to\r\nhave been executed before the year 1310. In the north choir-aisle at\r\nWestminster, the Shield (now mutilated) of the Emperor FREDERICK II. is\r\nboldly sculptured by an heraldic artist of the time of our HENRY III.,\r\nNo. 200; here the Eagle had one head only. The German Emperors naturally\r\nadopted the Eagle for their heraldic Ensign, in support of their claim\r\nto be successors to the Roman Cæsars; and the Russian Czars, with the\r\nsame motive, have also assumed the same ensign. The Eagle having two\r\nheads, which severally look to the dexter and the sinister, as in No.\r\n201, typified a rule that claimed to extend over both the Eastern and\r\nthe Western Empires; as the Eagle with a single head, No. 202, might be\r\nconsidered to have a less comprehensive signification. The Eagles of the\r\nPrinces of Germany are frequently to be found, blazoned for them, in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 200.--In Westminster Abbey.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 201.--Imperial Eagle.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 202.--Royal Eagle.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 203.--Cornwall.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 204.--Seal of Euphemia Leslie.]\r\n\r\nRICHARD, the second son of King JOHN, in the year 1256 was elected King\r\nof Germany (he is generally styled \"King of the Romans\"), when he bore\r\nthe Eagle of the Empire: but the only Seals of this Prince that are\r\nknown to exist in England display the Shield of his English Earldom of\r\nCornwall, No. 140. His Son EDMUND, who succeeded to his father's\r\nEarldom, on his Seals has represented an _Eagle bearing in its beak his\r\nShield of Cornwall_, as in No. 203: this is a peculiarly interesting\r\nexample of an heraldic usage of striking significance, and it also\r\nillustrates the early existence of the sentiment which at a later period\r\nled to the adoption of \"Supporters\" to Shields of Arms. In the early\r\nHeraldry of Scotland, a single displayed Eagle is occasionally found\r\nsupporting an armorial Shield; as in the Seals of ALEXANDER STEWARD,\r\nEarl of MENTEITH, A.D. 1296, and WILLIAM, Earl of DOUGLAS and MAR, A.D.\r\n1378 (Seton's \"Scottish Heraldry,\" Plates VIII. and XII.): sometimes\r\nalso, as Mr. Seton has observed, \"the Eagle's breast is charged with\r\nmore than one Shield, as in the case of the Seals of MARGARET STEWART,\r\nCountess of ANGUS (1366), and EUPHEMIA LESLIE, Countess of ROSS (1381),\r\non both of which _three_ escutcheons make their appearance\" (\"Scottish\r\nHeraldry,\" p. 268, and Plate XII., No. 5): in No. 204 I give a woodcut\r\nof this interesting composition; the Shields are, to the dexter,\r\nLESLIE--_Arg., on a bend az., three buckles or_; in the centre, the Arms\r\nof the Earl of ROSS--_Gu., three Lions rampant arg., within a tressure_;\r\nand, to the sinister, CUMMIN--_Az., three garbs or_. The Imperial Eagle\r\nis sometimes represented crowned; the heads also in some examples are\r\nencircled with a _nimbus_ or glory, as in No. 212. I must add that in\r\nthe Heraldry of the English Peerage the Imperial Eagle still supports\r\nthe Shields of some few Peers of different ranks; as, for example, that\r\nof Baron METHUEN.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 205.--Shield of Piers Gaveston.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 206.--Montacute and Monthermer.]\r\n\r\nPIERS GAVESTON, who was created Earl of CORNWALL by EDWARD II.,\r\nbore--_Vert, six Eaglets or_, No. 205, (E. 2 and York stained glass): on\r\nhis Seal, however, the number of the Eaglets is reduced to _three_.\r\nAnother early example is the Shield of that gallant and persevering\r\nknight, RALPH DE MONTHERMER--_Or, an Eagle displayed vert_, No. 206, who\r\nbecame Earl of GLOUCESTER in right of his wife, JOAN, daughter of\r\nEDWARD I., and widow of GILBERT DE CLARE, the \"Red Earl\"; this green\r\nEagle of Monthermer long held a place of high distinction in the\r\nmediæval Heraldry of England, marshalled on the Shields of the Earls of\r\nSALISBURY and WARWICK; in which, as in the example, No. 206, the Eagle\r\nof Monthermer is quartered with the coat of Montacute, No. 20 (page 17).\r\nThe Eagle of early Heraldry was sometimes blazoned as an \"_Erne_,\"[4]\r\nand sometimes as an \"_Alerion_,\" WILLIAM D'ERNFORD (H. 3) bears--_Sa.,\r\nan Erne displayed arg._: and, at the same period WM. DE ERNFIELD bears a\r\npair of Erne's or Eagle's Wings, called a \"_Vol_,\" No. 207. From Shields\r\nof the fourteenth century which bear Eagles, and are blazoned in the\r\nRoll of Edward II., I select the following small group as good\r\nexamples:--Sir WM. DE MONGOMERIE--_Or, an Eagle displayed az._: Sir\r\nNICHOLAS DE ETONE--_Gu., a Chevron between three Eaglets arg._: Sir JOHN\r\nDE CHARLESTONE--_Arg., on a Chevron vert three Eaglets or_: Sir PHILIP\r\nDE VERLEY--_Or, a Bend gu., between six Eaglets sa._: Sir JOHN DE LA\r\nMERE--_Arg., on a Bend az. three Eaglets or_, No. 209: a Shield bearing\r\na Bend charged with three Eagles, but with different tinctures, No. 88,\r\nI have shown to have been the Arms of the Grandisons.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: Query if this is not really a herne or\r\n    heron.--A. C. F.-D.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 207.--A Vol.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 209.--De la Mere.]\r\n\r\nEagles, under their name of \"_Alerions_\" (which early Heralds\r\nrepresented without feet and beaks), are blazoned in the same\r\ndisposition as in No. 209, in the Arms of the Duchy of LORRAINE,--_Or,\r\non a Bend gu. three alerions arg._: and this device the Dukes of\r\nLorraine _are said_ to have borne in commemoration of an exploit of\r\ntheir famous ancestor, GODFREY DE BOLOGNE, _who is also said_, when\r\n\"shooting against David's tower in Jerusalem,\" to have \"broched upon his\r\narrow three footless birds called alerions.\" \"It is impossible,\" remarks\r\nMr. Planché upon this legend, \"now to ascertain who broached this\r\nwonderful story; but it is perfectly evident that the narrator was the\r\nparty who drew the long bow, and not the noble GODFREY.\" Mr. Planché\r\nadds, that the Alerions of Lorraine may indicate an alliance with the\r\nImperial House; and he directs attention to \"a similarity in sound\r\nbetween 'Alerion' and 'Lorraine,'\" and also to a singular Anagram\r\nproduced by the letters ALERION and LORAINE, which are the same\r\n(\"Pursuivant of Arms,\" p. 87). The Arms of Lorraine are still borne by\r\nthe Emperor of AUSTRIA: and in England they were quartered by Queen\r\nMARGARET of Anjou.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 210.--Shield at St. Albans.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 211.--The Austrian Eagle.]\r\n\r\nThe Roll of Edward II. gives also for Sir HUGH DE BILBESWORTH these\r\narms--_Az., three Eagles displayed or_. A similar Shield, the tinctures\r\nchanged to--_Arg., three Eagles displayed gu., armed or_, was borne by\r\nROBERT DE EGLESFIELD, Confessor to PHILIPPA of Hainault, Queen of\r\nEDWARD III., who in the year 1340 founded Queen's College, Oxford: this\r\nShield of the Founder is borne by the College. One of the Shields in the\r\nChantry of Abbot RAMRYGE in St. Albans Abbey Church bears the same\r\ncharges--_three eagles displayed_, No. 210: the drawing of the eagle in\r\nthis Shield is remarkable, and the form of the Shield itself is\r\nsingularly characteristic of the close of the fifteenth century. Another\r\nShield in the same monument bears a single Eagle, drawn in the same\r\nmanner, and sculptured with extraordinary spirit. The German Heralds,\r\nand also their brethren of France, delight in exaggerations of what I\r\nmay distinguish as the Westminster Eagle, No. 200. The Austrian Eagle,\r\nbesides having both its heads crowned, has a large Imperial Crown placed\r\nbetween and above the two heads, as in No. 211. The Imperial Eagle (Holy\r\nRoman Empire) sometimes has a nimbus or glory about each head, which\r\ndignified accessory is represented by a circular line, as in No. 212. In\r\nsome examples of Eagles, as well in our own Heraldry as in that of\r\ncontinental countries, the wings are represented as _erect_ (the more\r\nusual form in England), and having the tips of all the principal\r\nfeathers pointing upwards, as in No. 213. The Eagle borne as the Ensign\r\nof Imperial FRANCE was represented grasping a thunderbolt, in an\r\nattitude of vigilance, having its wings displayed, but with the tips of\r\nthe feathers drooping, as they would be in the living bird; No. 214.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 212.--Imperial Eagle, with Nimbus.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 213.--Eagle \"displayed,\" with Wings erect.]\r\n\r\nEDWARD III., as a Second Crest, bore an Eagle. An Eagle also was borne\r\nfor his Crest, as the imperial bird was displayed upon his Shield (No.\r\n206), by Earl RALPH DE MONTHERMER. In the more recent Heraldry of\r\nEngland, the Eagle is a Supporter to the Shields of the Earls of\r\nCLARENDON, COVENTRY, and MALMESBURY; the Viscounts BOLINGBROKE and ST.\r\nVINCENT; and the Barons HEYTESBURY, RADSTOCK, WYNFORD, and others.\r\nEagles also and Demi-Eagles are borne as Crests in the English Heraldry\r\nof our own day.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 214.--French Imperial Eagle.]\r\n\r\nIn drawing our heraldic Eagles, we can scarcely improve upon some of the\r\nexamples in which early English Heralds expressed their ideas of the\r\nking of birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE GRAMMAR OF HERALDRY\r\n\r\nSECTION VII\r\n\r\n  _Glossary of Titles, Names, and Terms_\r\n\r\n  \"The several denominations given to these tokens of honour ...\r\n  with the terms of art given to them.\"\r\n    --RANDLE HOME: \"Academy of Armoury,\" A.D. 1688.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this Glossary, which obviously must be as concise as possible,\r\nI shall include no word that is ordinarily well understood, unless some\r\nspecial signification should be attached to it when it is in use in\r\narmorial blazon.\r\n\r\n_Abased._ Said of a charge when placed lower than its customary\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n_Abatement._ A supposed sign of degradation.

A Reindeer is represented in Heraldry with double attires, one\r\npair erect, and the other drooping forward.\r\n\r\n_Augmentation._ An honourable addition to a Coat of Arms, specially\r\ngranted with a peculiar significance: thus, the \"Union\" Device of the\r\nBritish Empire, blazoned on an inescutcheon, is the \"_Augmentation_\"\r\nspecially granted to the great Duke of WELLINGTON, to be borne on the\r\nhonour point of his paternal shield.\r\n\r\n_Augmented._ Having an \"Augmentation.\"\r\n\r\n_Avellane._ A variety of the heraldic Cross: No. 109.\r\n\r\n_Azure._ The colour _blue_ (indicated by horizontal lines): No. 52.\r\n\r\n_Badge._ A figure or device, distinct from a crest, and capable of being\r\nborne without any background or other accessory.

No certain\r\norigin has been discovered for the Lancastrian \"Collar of S.,\" but it\r\nhas been suggested that it represents the word SOVERAYGNE, the motto of\r\nHENRY IV. No. 230 is from the Brass to HENRY BOURCHIER, K.G., Earl of\r\nEssex, at Little Easton, Suffolk, A.D. 1483; and No. 231 from the Brass\r\nto Lord CAMOYS, K.G., at Trotton, Sussex, A.D. 1424.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 230.--A Collar of York.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 231.--A Collar of Lancaster.]\r\n\r\n_College of Arms_, or _Heralds' College_.

In modern times\r\nEnglish Coronets have enclosed a velvet cap with a bullion tassel. This\r\ncap originated in the cap of estate worn by Peers. (See _Prince_,\r\n_Duke_, _Marquess_, _Earl_, _Viscount_, and _Baron_.)\r\n\r\n_Cotise._ A diminutive of the Bend or other Ordinary, being one-fourth\r\nof their width. _Cotised_. When a Bend or Chevron is placed between two\r\nCotises, or when a Fesse or Bar is placed between two Barrulets. Nos.\r\n114, 115.\r\n\r\n_Couchant._ In repose. No. 177.\r\n\r\n_Couchée._ Said of a Shield when suspended from the sinister extremity\r\nof the chief, or when placed as if it were so suspended.

No. 67.\r\n\r\n_Counter-Embattled._ A term in use for a fesse, bar, or chevron when\r\nembattled on both edges.\r\n\r\n_Counter-seal._ Early seals were generally impressed on both sides; and\r\nthe seals thus were produced from two dies or matrices. The two sides\r\nwere severally called the _seal_ and the _counter-seal_, the latter\r\nbeing termed the _reverse_ of the compound composition. Every such\r\ndouble impression constituted a single seal. Both seal and counter-seal\r\nwere sometimes used alone; and the counter-seal was regarded as a\r\nprivate seal, or _secretum_.\r\n\r\n_Couped._ Cut off _smoothly_--the reverse of \"erased.\"\r\n\r\n_Couple-close._ Half a _chevronel_.\r\n\r\n_Courant._ Running.\r\n\r\n_Courtesy, Titles of._ Nominal degrees of rank, conceded to, and borne\r\nby, the Eldest Sons of Dukes, Marquesses, and Earls, and other titles\r\nused by their younger children and all children of Viscounts and Barons.\r\n\r\n_Coward_, _Cowed_.

The Emperor took from his head his own chaplet of\r\nrue, and threw it across the shield of Duke Bernhard. This story is\r\nprobably untrue.\r\n\r\n_Crenellated._ Embattled.\r\n\r\n_Crescent._ No. 166. In modern English cadency, the difference of the\r\nsecond son, or house.\r\n\r\n_Cresset._ A beacon.\r\n\r\n_Crest._ A figure or device originally worn upon a helm, and now\r\ngenerally represented above a Shield of arms. Crests at first were\r\nensigns of high honour, and their use was restricted to a few persons of\r\neminence: they were attached by a _wreath_, or _torse_, or by a\r\n_coronet_, to the helm or basinet; and sometimes a crest stood upon a\r\ncap of estate. Crests are still represented standing upon either a\r\nwreath, or a cap, or issuing from a coronet: but in our own Heraldry a\r\n_crest-coronet_ must always be carefully distinguished from those\r\ncoronets that are insignia of princely and noble rank. Crests are not\r\nborne by ladies, a reigning Sovereign only excepted. (See _Panache_,\r\n_Rebus_, and Chapter XIV.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 232.--Crest Coronet.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 233.--Crest-Wreath.]\r\n\r\n_Crest-Coronet._ A coronet from which issues, or which supports,\r\na crest. No. 232.\r\n\r\n_Crest-Wreath_, or _Torse_. In the Middle Ages, of rich materials and\r\ncostly workmanship; now represented as being formed of two rolls of silk\r\nof the principal metal and colour in the arms, which are twisted to show\r\nthe metal and colour alternately. The earliest examples are about A.D.\r\n1375. No. 233 shows three varieties of representation. (See Chapter\r\nXIV.)\r\n\r\n_Crined._ Having a mane or hair.\r\n\r\n_Cross._ One of the Ordinaries. Nos. 90-110.\r\n\r\n_Crown._ The ensign of Royal and Imperial dignity; in Heraldry borne as\r\na charge, and also used to denote the rank of a Sovereign Prince. The\r\nCrown that is generally borne as a charge is represented without arches,\r\nand resembling No. 232. Certain other crowns, each distinguished by an\r\nappropriate title, are also sometimes borne on shields, or introduced as\r\nheraldic accessories. (See _Celestial_, _Eastern_ or _Radiated_,\r\n_Mural_, _Naval_, and _Vallary_ Crowns.) The different forms assumed at\r\ndifferent periods by the Royal Crown of England are faithfully\r\nexemplified in the seals and the coinage of the successive Sovereigns,\r\nand several fine examples are preserved in the Royal effigies. The\r\nadornment of the regal circlet was arbitrary before the fifteenth\r\ncentury; still, it always was enriched with gems and surmounted by\r\ngolden foliage. HENRY V. first arched his crown; and by HENRY VI. the\r\ncirclet was first heightened with alternate crosses-patée and fleurs de\r\nlys. This arrangement has since been retained, the subsequent\r\nalterations being restricted to changes in the number and in the contour\r\nof the arches. The crown of His Majesty the KING has the circlet\r\nheightened with four crosses and as many fleurs de lys; from the crosses\r\nrise the arches, which are surmounted by a mound and a cross-patée. No.\r\n234. This, the heraldic crown, is not an exact reproduction of the\r\nactual crown of the King.\r\n\r\n_Crozier._ Strictly, the cross-staff of an archbishop; distinguished by\r\nits form from the pastoral-staff with a crook-head, of bishops; but the\r\nterm is loosely and very generally applied also to the crook-headed\r\npastoral-staff.\r\n\r\n_Crusilee_, _Crusily_. Having the field semée of crosses-crosslets, or\r\nof other small crosses, their peculiar form (when not crosslets) being\r\nspecified.\r\n\r\n_Cubit arm._ A human arm couped between the elbow and the wrist.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 234.--Crown of H.M. The King.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 235.--Dacre Knot and Badges.]\r\n\r\n_Cup_, _Covered Cup_. A vessel formed like a chalice, and having a\r\nraised cover; borne by the BOTILERS, BUTLERS, &c.\r\n\r\n_Cushion_, _Pillow_, _Oreiller_. Unless described of another form,\r\nsquare or oblong, and with a tassel at each corner.\r\n\r\n_Dacre Knot._ No. 235. (See _Knot_.)\r\n\r\n_Dancetté._ No. 38B. In early blazon, a fesse dancetté is styled simply\r\n\"a _dancette_\" or \"a _danse_.\" Nos. 78, 146; and No. 20A, page 70.\r\n\r\n_Debruised._ When an ordinary surmounts an animal or another charge.\r\n\r\n_Decrescent._ A half-moon having its horns to the sinister. No. 166C.\r\n\r\n_Deer._ In general practice very little if any differentiation is made\r\nbetween the _Stag_, the _Buck_, and the _Hart_; the female is a _Hind_,\r\nand of course is without attires. (See Chapter VIII.)\r\n\r\n_Degrees._ A term applied to the steps upon which a Cross Calvary is\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\n_Demembered_, _Dismembered_. Cut into pieces, but without any alteration\r\nin the form of the original figure.\r\n\r\n_Demi._ The half. The upper, front, or dexter half, unless the contrary\r\nbe specified. No. 186.\r\n\r\n_Depressed._ Surmounted.\r\n\r\n_Dexter._ The right side. No. 27C.\r\n\r\n_Diaper_, _Diapering_. Surface decoration. No. 68.\r\n\r\n_Difference_, _Differencing_. An addition to, or some change in,\r\na Coat-of-Arms, introduced for the purpose of distinguishing Coats which\r\nin their primary qualities are the same. (See Chapters XII. and XIII.)\r\n\r\n_Dimidiated._ Cut in halves per pale, and one half removed: No. 250.\r\n(See Chapter XI.)\r\n\r\n_Disclosed._ With expanded wings, in the case of birds that are _not_\r\nbirds of prey. The contrary to _Close_.\r\n\r\n_Displayed._ Birds of prey with expanded wings. No. 200.\r\n\r\n_Disposed_, _Disposition_. Arranged, arrangement.\r\n\r\n_Dividing Lines._ No. 38: also Nos. 27-37.\r\n\r\n_Dolphin._ A favourite fish with Heralds. The heraldic Dolphin of\r\nantiquity is exemplified in No. 8; that of the Middle Ages in No. 163.\r\n\r\n_Dormant._ Asleep, as in No. 179.\r\n\r\n_Double-queued._ Having two tails. No. 181.\r\n\r\n_Doubling._ The lining of a Mantle or Mantling.\r\n\r\n_Dove-tail._ No. 381.\r\n\r\n_Dragon._ A winged monster having four legs. No. 236.\r\n\r\n_Duke._ The highest rank and title in the British Peerage; first\r\nintroduced by EDWARD III. in the year 1337, when he created the BLACK\r\nPRINCE the first English Duke (in Latin, \"_Dux_\"). A Duke is \"Most\r\nNoble\"; he is styled \"My Lord Duke,\" and \"Your Grace\"; and all his\r\nyounger sons are \"Lords,\" and all his daughters \"Ladies,\" with the\r\nprefix \"Right Honourable.\" His eldest son bears, by courtesy, his\r\nfather's \"second title\"; and, accordingly, he generally bears the title\r\nof Marquess. Whatever his title, however, the rank of the eldest son of\r\na Duke is always the same, and it assigns to him precedence between\r\nMarquesses and Earls. The Coronet of a Duke, arbitrary in its adornment\r\nuntil the sixteenth century was far advanced, is now a circlet,\r\nheightened with eight conventional strawberry-leaves, of which in\r\nrepresentations three and two half-leaves are shown; No. 237. It\r\nencloses a velvet cap. The present ducal coronet is represented in the\r\nportrait of LUDOVICK STUART, K.G., Duke of RICHMOND and LENNOX, who died\r\nin 1624; the picture, the property of the Crown, is at Hampton Court.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 236.--Dragon.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 237.--Circlet of a Duke's Coronet.]\r\n\r\n_Ducal Coronet._ A term commonly, but not very accurately, applied to a\r\n_Crest Coronet_. No. 232.\r\n\r\n_Duchess._ The wife of a Duke. She is \"Most Noble,\" and is styled \"Your\r\nGrace.\" Her coronet is the same as that of a Duke.\r\n\r\n_Eagle._ See Chapter IX., page 92.\r\n\r\n_Eaglet._ An Eagle on a small scale.\r\n\r\n_Earl._ In Latin, \"Comes\"; in French, \"Comte\" or \"Count.\" Before 1337,\r\nthe highest, and now the third degree of rank and dignity in the British\r\nPeerage. An Earl is \"Right Honourable\"; he is styled \"My Lord\"; his\r\neldest son bears his father's \"second title,\" generally that of\r\nViscount; his other sons are styled \"Honourable,\" but all his daughters\r\nare \"Ladies.\" The circlet of an Earl's Coronet has eight lofty rays of\r\ngold rising from the circlet, each of which supports a large pearl,\r\nwhile between each pair of these rays there is a golden strawberry-leaf.\r\nIn representations five of the rays and pearls are shown; No. 238.\r\nElevated clusters of pearls appear in an Earl's coronet--that of THOMAS\r\nFITZ ALAN, Earl of ARUNDEL--as early as 1445; but the present form of\r\nthe coronet may be assigned to the second half of the following century.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 238.--Circlet of an Earl's Coronet.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 239.--Eastern Crown.]\r\n\r\n_Eastern_, _Radiated_, or _Antique Crown_. No. 239.\r\n\r\n_Electoral Bonnet._ A cap of crimson velvet guarded with ermine, borne,\r\nin the Royal Arms, over the inescutcheon of the arms of Hanover from\r\n1801 till 1816. No. 240.\r\n\r\n_Embattled_, and _Counter-Embattled_. A term applied to a fess or bar\r\nwhen so depicted both above and below.\r\n\r\n_Embowed._ Bent.

Surrounded.\r\n\r\n_Equipped._ Fully armed, caparisoned, or provided.\r\n\r\n_Eradicated._ Torn up by the roots.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 240.--Electoral Bonnet.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 241.--Shield of Byron.]\r\n\r\n_Erased._ Torn off with a ragged edge; the contrary to _Couped_.\r\n\r\n_Ermine_, _Ermines_, _Erminois_.

(See _Mullet_.)\r\n\r\n_False._ Said of any charge when its central area is removed--thus, an\r\n_Annulet_ is a \"false roundle.\"\r\n\r\n_Fan_, or _Winnowing Fan_, or _Vane_.

DE SEVANS, A.D. 1305, at Chartham, in Kent, and in the\r\ncloisters at Canterbury.\r\n\r\n_Fan Crest._ An early form of decoration for the knightly helm,\r\nexemplified in the 2nd Great Seal of RICHARD I., and in many other\r\nSeals, until about A.D. 1350.

Subordinaries: Nos. 141, 142.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 246.--Fleur de lys.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 247.--France Ancient.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 248.--France Modern.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 249.--Edmund, Earl of Lancaster.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 250.--Margaret, Queen of Edward I.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 251.--Seal of Margaret, second Queen of Edward I.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 252.--Shield of Edward III., A.D. 1340.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 253.--Shield of Henry IV., about A.D. 1405.]\r\n\r\n_Fleur de lys._ The beautiful heraldic device so long identified with\r\nthe history of France: No. 246 (from the monument of EDWARD III.?). The\r\nfleur de lys, derived, it would seem, from the flower of a lily\r\nresembling the iris, was adopted by LOUIS VII. (A.D. 1137-1180) as his\r\nroyal ensign, and in due time it was regularly charged upon a true\r\nShield of Arms. Originally the Royal Shield of France was--_Az., semée\r\nof fleurs de lys, or_; the fleurs de lys scattered freely over the\r\nfield, and the Shield itself having the appearance of having been cut\r\nout of a larger object, over the whole surface of which the flowers had\r\nbeen _semée_. This Shield of France is distinguished as \"_France\r\nAncient_\": No. 247. About A.D. 1365, CHARLES V. of France reduced the\r\nnumber of the fleurs de lys to three; and this Shield is now known as\r\n\"_France Modern_\": No. 248. In the year 1275, EDMUND, first Earl of\r\nLancaster, the second son of HENRY III., married BLANCHE of Artois, when\r\nhe differenced his shield of England with _a label of France--a blue\r\nlabel charged on each point with three golden fleurs de lys_. No. 249,\r\nthus, for the first time did the armorial insignia of England and France\r\nappear together upon the same Shield. In 1299 EDWARD I. married his\r\nsecond Queen, MARGARET of France, and then this royal lady placed on one\r\nof her Seals a Shield of England and France dimidiated: No. 250. On\r\nanother of her Seals, a very noble example of the Seal-engraver's art,\r\nQueen MARGARET displayed the Shield of King EDWARD I., her husband,\r\n_surrounded, on the field of the Seal, with her father's fleurs de lys_:\r\nNo. 251. On the Seals of ISABELLE of France, Queen of EDWARD II., the\r\nsame dimidiated shield, and another shield quartering the arms of\r\nEngland with _France Ancient_ and two other French coats (_Navarre_ and\r\n_Champagne_) appear. Then Prince JOHN of ELTHAM charged a \"bordure of\r\nFrance\" _upon his shield_, No. 24; thus applying the suggestion of the\r\nSeal of Queen MARGARET, No. 251, in such a manner as was consistent with\r\nthe advanced condition of heraldic art. On his accession in 1327,\r\nEDWARD III. placed a fleur de lys on each side of the Shield of England\r\nupon his Great Seal: and in 1340, when he claimed the crown of France,\r\nEDWARD _quartered France Ancient with his lions of England_: No. 252.\r\nShortly after his accession, perhaps in 1405, in order to conform to the\r\naltered blazonry of the French sovereigns, HENRY IV. quartered _France\r\nModern_ on his shield: No. 253. The position of the three fleurs de lys\r\nwas more than once changed in the Royal Shield of England (as I shall\r\nhereafter show more particularly) after the accession of the STUARTS;\r\nand they were not finally removed till the first year of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The fleur de lys is also borne on many English Shields,\r\ndisposed in various ways. In modern cadency the fleur de lys is the\r\ndifference of the sixth son, or house.\r\n\r\n_Fleurettée_, _Florettée_. Terminating in, or bordered with, fleurs de\r\nlys; also, _semée de lys_.\r\n\r\n_Fleurie_, or _Fleury_. Ending as No. 100; also, _semée de lys_.\r\n\r\n_Flexed._ Bowed, bent.\r\n\r\n_Flighted._ Feathered, as arrows are.\r\n\r\n_Fly._ The length, and also the side of a flag farthest from the staff.\r\n\r\n_Foliated._ Crisped, or formed like a leaf.\r\n\r\n_Fountain._ No. 153.\r\n\r\n_Fourchée_, _Queue Fourchée_. A term applied to a lion with a forked\r\ntail.\r\n\r\n_Fret_, or _Frette_. A subordinary: No. 148. _Frettée_, _Fretty_:\r\ncovered with fretwork: No. 149.\r\n\r\n_Fructed._ Bearing fruit or seeds.\r\n\r\n_Furs._ See p. 41: Nos. 57-65.\r\n\r\n_Fusil._ An elongated Lozenge: No. 20A, p. 70. _Fusillée_, or _Fusilly_.\r\nA field entirely composed of Fusils, all lying in the same plane.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Nos. 254, 255.--Fylfot.]\r\n\r\n_Fylfot._ A peculiar cruciform figure, supposed to have a mystic\r\nsignification, found in military and ecclesiastical decorations in\r\nEngland, and on Eastern coins, &c.: Nos. 254, 255; the latter example is\r\nfrom the monument of Bishop BRONSCOMBE, in Exeter Cathedral.\r\n\r\n_Gad_, _Gadlyng_. A spike, knob, or other figure, projecting from the\r\nknuckles of gauntlets.\r\n\r\n_Galley._ An ancient ship. (See _Lymphad_.)\r\n\r\n_Garb._ A sheaf of wheat; if of any other grain, this to be specified.\r\n\r\n_Garnished._ Adorned in a becoming manner.\r\n\r\n_Garter, Order of the._ See Chapter XIX.\r\n\r\n_Garter King-of-Arms_. The chief of the official Heralds of England, and\r\nofficer of arms of the Order of the Garter.

The circumstances which\r\nled to his association with England are unknown. His Shield of arms, _a\r\nred cross on a silver field_, first appears in English Heraldry in the\r\nfourteenth century: No. 1.\r\n\r\n_George, The._ A mounted figure of the Saint in the act of piercing the\r\ndragon with his lance, and worn as a pendant to the collar of the Order\r\nof the Garter; added to the insignia of the Order, with the Collar, by\r\nHENRY VII. The _Lesser George_ has the same group on an enamelled field,\r\nand surrounded by the Garter of the Order, the whole forming a \"jewel,\"\r\ngenerally oval in shape: it was introduced by HENRY VIII., and is now\r\nworn pendent from the dark-blue ribbon of the Order, the ribbon passing\r\nover the left shoulder and the jewel hanging on the right side of the\r\nwearer. Originally, this \"Lesser George\" was worn from either a gold\r\nchain or a black ribbon: by Queen ELIZABETH the colour of the ribbon was\r\nchanged to sky-blue, and it assumed its present darker hue in the reign\r\nof CHARLES II.\r\n\r\n_Gerattyng._ Differencing by the introduction of small charges. It is an\r\nearly term, now obsolete.\r\n\r\n_Gimmel-ring._ Two annulets, interlaced.\r\n\r\n_Girt_, _Girdled_.

Sprinkled over with drops either of gold--_gouttée\r\nd'or_; of silver--_d'eau_; of blue--_de larmes_ (tears); of red--_de\r\nsang_ (blood); or of black--_de poix_ (pitch).\r\n\r\n_Grand Quarters._ The four primary divisions of a Shield, when it is\r\ndivided _quarterly_: Nos. 30, 36, 37. The term \"Grand Quarter\" may be\r\nused to signify a primary quarter or division of a quartered Shield or\r\nCoat, and to distinguish such a quarter when _it is quartered_.\r\n\r\n_Grieces._ Steps.\r\n\r\n_Guardant._ Looking out from the field: Nos. 172, 174, 176, 187.\r\n\r\n_Guige._ A Shield-belt, worn over the right shoulder, and frequently\r\nrepresented in heraldic compositions as if sustaining a Shield of arms:\r\nNos. 48, 49.\r\n\r\n_Gules._ Red: No. 53.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 256.--Shield of R. de Gorges.]\r\n\r\n_Gurges_, or _Gorges_. A charge formed of a spiral line of blue on a\r\nwhite field, and supposed to represent a whirlpool: borne (H. 3) by R.\r\nDE GORGES: No. 256.\r\n\r\n_Gyron._ A Subordinary. _Gyronny_.

Represented in blazon much in the same shape as\r\nthe implement in common use (H. 3).\r\n\r\n_Harp._ A device and badge of Ireland. The Irish Harp of gold with\r\nsilver strings on a blue field forms the third quarter of the Royal\r\nArms.\r\n\r\n_Hart._ A stag, with attires; the female is a _Hind_: page 81.\r\n\r\n_Hastilude._ A tournament.\r\n\r\n_Hatchment._ An achievement of arms in a lozenge-shaped frame, placed\r\nupon the front (generally over the principal entrance) of the residence\r\nof a person lately deceased. In the case of the decease of an unmarried\r\nperson, or of a widower or widow, the whole of the field of the\r\nhatchment is painted black; but in the case of a married person, that\r\npart only of the field is black which adjoins the side of the\r\nachievement occupied by the armorial insignia of the individual\r\ndeceased. Thus, if a husband be deceased, the dexter half of the field\r\nof the hatchment is black, and the sinister white; and so, in like\r\nmanner, if the wife be deceased, the sinister is black and the dexter\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 257.--Hawk's Lure.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 258.--Hawk's Bells and Jesses.]\r\n\r\n_Hauriant._ A fish in pale, its head in chief.\r\n\r\n_Hawk's bells, jesses, and lure._ A falconer's decoy, formed of feathers\r\nwith their tips in base, and joined by a cord and ring, No. 257; also\r\nbells with straps to be attached to hawks, No. 258.\r\n\r\n_Heightened._ Raised; placed above or higher.\r\n\r\n_Heights._ Applied to plumes of feathers which are arranged in rows or\r\nsets, one rising above another. See _Panache_.\r\n\r\n_Helm_, _Helmet_. Now placed as an accessory above a Shield of arms, and\r\nbearing its Crest after the fashion in which, in the Middle Ages, both\r\nHelm and Crest were actually worn in tournaments. A modern usage\r\ndistinguishes Helms as follows:--The Sovereign--Helm of gold, with six\r\nbars, set _affrontée_, No. 259; Noblemen--Helm of silver, garnished with\r\ngold, set in profile, and showing five bars, No. 260; Baronets and\r\nKnights--of steel with silver ornaments, without bars, the vizor raised,\r\nset _affrontée_, No. 261; Esquires and Gentlemen--of steel, the vizor\r\nclosed, and set in profile, Nos. 262, 263. The Helms that appear on\r\nearly Seals and in other heraldic compositions till about A.D. 1600, are\r\nall set in profile, and the shield generally hangs from them _couchée_,\r\nas in No. 49. In these early compositions, the shield is small in\r\nproportion to the helm and its accessories.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 259.--Helm of the Sovereign.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 260.--Helm of Nobles.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 261.--Helm of Baronets and Knights.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Nos. 262, 263.--Helms of Esquires and Gentlemen.]\r\n\r\n_Hemp-brake_, _Hackle_. An instrument having saw-teeth, used for\r\nbruising hemp.\r\n\r\n_Heneage Knot._ No. 264.\r\n\r\n_Herald._ An officer of arms. The Heralds of England were incorporated\r\nby RICHARD III.; and from Queen MARY, in 1555, they received a grant of\r\nDerby House, on the site of which, between St. Paul's Cathedral and the\r\nThames, stands their present official residence, HERALDS' COLLEGE, or\r\nthe COLLEGE OF ARMS. The college now consists of three\r\nKINGS-OF-ARMS--_Garter_, _Clarenceux_, and _Norroy_; six HERALDS, who\r\nhave precedence by seniority of appointment--_Chester_, _Lancaster_,\r\n_Richmond_, _Windsor_, _York_, and _Somerset_; and four\r\nPURSUIVANTS--_Rouge Dragon_, _Portcullis_, _Rouge Croix_, and\r\n_Bluemantle_. The official habit is a _Tabard_, emblazoned with the\r\nRoyal Arms, and the Kings and Heralds wear a _Collar of SS._ The Kings\r\nhave a Crown, formed of a golden circlet, from which rise sixteen\r\noak-leaves, nine of which appear in representations; and the circlet\r\nitself is charged with the words, _Miserere mei Deus secundum magnam\r\nmisericordiam tuam_ (\"Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy great\r\nloving-kindness\").\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 264.--Heneage Knot.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 265.--Arms of the Heralds' College.]\r\n\r\nThe supreme head of the English Heralds, under the SOVEREIGN, is the\r\nEARL MARSHAL, an office hereditary in the family of the DUKE OF NORFOLK.\r\nThe Arms of the College are--_Arg., a cross gu., between four doves\r\ntheir dexter wings expanded and inverted az._: No. 265; Crest--_From a\r\ncrest-coronet or, a dove rising az._; Supporters--_Two lions ramp.\r\nguard. arg., ducally gorged or_. Each of the Kings has his own official\r\narms, which he impales with his paternal coat on the _dexter_ side of\r\nthe shield. The Arms of Garter are--_Arg., a cross gu.; on a chief az.,\r\na ducal coronet encircled with a Garter of the Order, between a lion of\r\nEngland and a fleur de lys, all or_. Clarenceux and Norroy have the same\r\nshield, but the former has _a lion of England only, crowned, on a chief\r\ngules_; and the latter, _on a chief per pale az. and gu._, has\r\n_a similar lion between a fleur de lys and a key, all of gold_.\r\n\r\nThere is also another King styled \"Bath,\" who is specially attached to\r\nthe Order of the Bath; he is not a member of the College.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 266.--Arms of Lyon Office.]\r\n\r\n\"Lyon King-of-Arms\" is the chief Herald of Scotland; and the\r\nestablishment over which he presides is styled the \"Lyon Office.\" The\r\nArms of the Office are--_Arg., a lion sejant erect and affronté gu.,\r\nholding in his dexter paw a thistle slipped vert, and in the sinister an\r\nescutcheon of the second; on a chief az., a saltire of the first_: No.\r\n266.\r\n\r\nIreland is the heraldic province of \"Ulster King-of-Arms.\" His official\r\narmorial ensigns differ from those of Garter only in the _charges of the\r\nchief_, which are _a lion of England between a golden harp and a\r\nportcullis_.\r\n\r\n_Herison._ A hedgehog.\r\n\r\n_Hill_, _Hillock_. A mound of earth.\r\n\r\n_Hirondelle._ A swallow.\r\n\r\n_Hoist._ The depth of a flag from chief to base.

Stained with blood.\r\n\r\n_Impaled._ Conjoined per pale.\r\n\r\n_Impalement._ The uniting of two (or more) distinct coats per pale, to\r\nform a single achievement.\r\n\r\n_Imperially Crowned._ Ensigned with the Crown of England.\r\n\r\n_Incensed_, _Inflamed_. On fire; having fire issuing forth.\r\n\r\n_Increscent._ No. 166, B. See _Decrescent_.\r\n\r\n_Indented._ No. 38, A.\r\n\r\n_Inescutcheon._ An heraldic Shield borne as a charge. This term is\r\nsometimes used to denote an _Escutcheon of Pretence_.\r\n\r\n_In bend._ Disposed in the position of a bend; _In Chevron_, _In Chief_,\r\n_In Cross_, _In Fesse_, &c. Disposed after the manner of a chevron, or\r\nin the chief of the shield, or in the form of a cross, &c.\r\n\r\n_In Foliage._ Bearing leaves.\r\n\r\n_In Lure._ Wings conjoined in the form of a hawk's lure.\r\n\r\n_In her piety._ A term applied to a pelican feeding her young.\r\n\r\n_In Pretence._ A term applied to a single inescutcheon placed upon and\r\nin the centre of a larger escutcheon.\r\n\r\n_In Pride._ Having the tail displayed, as a peacock's.\r\n\r\n_In Quadrangle._ When four charges are so disposed that one is in each\r\nquarter of the shield.\r\n\r\n_In Splendour._ The sun irradiated.\r\n\r\n_Irradiated._ Surrounded by rays of light.\r\n\r\n_Issuant._ Proceeding from, or out of.\r\n\r\n_Jambe_, _Gambe_. The leg of a lion, or other beast of prey: No. 185.\r\n\r\n_Jelloped._ Having wattles and a comb, as a cock.\r\n\r\n_Jesses._ Straps for hawk's bells.\r\n\r\n_Jessant._ Shooting forth. _Jessant de lys._--A combination of a\r\nleopard's face and a fleur-de-lys: No. 267.\r\n\r\n_Joust._ A tournament.\r\n\r\n_Jupon._ A short, sleeveless surcoat, worn over armour from about 1340\r\nto about 1405. It is often charged with armorial insignia, and thus is a\r\ntrue \"coat of arms.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 267.--Jessant de lys.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Nos. 268, 269.--Heraldic Keys.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 270.--Hastings Badge.]\r\n\r\n_Key._ When represented in early blazon, Keys have always elegant forms.\r\nNo. 268 is from Peterborough Cathedral, and No. 269 from Exeter.\r\n\r\n_King-of-Arms._ See _Herald_.\r\n\r\n_Knighthood, Orders of_: _Knights_. See Chapter XVI.\r\n\r\n_Knot._ An intertwined cord, borne as a badge. The varieties of this\r\ndevice are--The _Bourchier_, No. 219; the _Bowen_, No. 220; the\r\n_Harington_ (the same as a _Frette_), No. 148; the _Heneage_, No. 264;\r\nthe _Lacy_, No. 274; the _Stafford_, No. 304; and the _Wake and Ormond_,\r\nNo. 313. Cords were sometimes intertwined about other figures and\r\ndevices, and so formed what may be regarded as _Compound Badges_, which\r\nsignificantly declared the union of two houses: thus, the knot of EDWARD\r\nLord HASTINGS unites the Hungerford sickle with the Peverel garbe: No.\r\n270; and the _Dacre knot_ is entwined about the Dacre escallop and the\r\nfamous \"ragged staff\" of Beauchamp and Neville: No. 235.\r\n\r\n_Label_, or _File_. A narrow ribbon placed across the field of a shield\r\nnear the chief, and having three, five, or sometimes other numbers of\r\n_points_ depending from it, its object being to _mark Cadency_. In the\r\nearly Labels the number of the points was arbitrary, the usual numbers\r\nbeing five and three; and, subsequently, three points were almost\r\nuniversally used; the object always was to render the Label conspicuous.\r\nIn blazon a Label is supposed to have three points; but, if more, the\r\nnumber is to be specified; thus, No. 271 is simply \"_a Label_,\" but No.\r\n272 is \"_a Label of five points_.\" Labels appear early in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and in the next century they are in constant use. Various\r\ncharges may be placed on the \"points\" of Labels to extend their capacity\r\nfor \"differencing.\" Since the time of EDWARD the BLACK PRINCE the Label\r\nof the PRINCE OF WALES has been plain silver. The Label is almost\r\nexclusively (now without any exception) used in Royal Cadency; but, in\r\nmodern Heraldry, in the case of all other persons it is the peculiar\r\nmark of the eldest son. The Label is also found as a charge. It has\r\nbecome a usage in the degenerate days of Heraldry to represent the Label\r\nas in No. 273, instead of the earlier and far preferable forms of Nos.\r\n271, 272.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Nos. 271-273.--Labels.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 274.--Lacy Knot.]\r\n\r\n_Lacy Knot._ No. 274.\r\n\r\n_Lambrequin._ A mantling.\r\n\r\n_Langued._ A term which refers to the tincture of an animal's tongue.\r\n\r\n_Leaves._ Their peculiarities are to be blazoned, as _laurel leaves_,\r\n_oak leaves_, &c.\r\n\r\n_Leopard_, _Leopardé._ See page 84.\r\n\r\n_Letters of the Alphabet_ sometimes are Charges. Thus, the Arms of the\r\nDeanery of Canterbury are--_Az., on a cross arg., the letter \"x\"\r\nsurmounted by the letter \"i\" sable:_ the \"x\" is on the cross at the\r\nintersection of its limbs, and the \"i\" is above it.\r\n\r\n_Line_, or _Border Line_. No. 38.\r\n\r\n_Lined._ Having a cord attached: also, having a lining.\r\n\r\n_Lion._ See page 83.\r\n\r\n_Lioncel._ A lion drawn to a small scale, and generally rampant, Nos.\r\n114, 115, 197.\r\n\r\n_Livery Colours._ Of the PLANTAGENETS, as one family, _white and\r\nscarlet_; of the house of YORK, _blue and murrey_; of the house of\r\nLANCASTER, _white and blue_; of the house of TUDOR, _white and green_.\r\nThe present Royal Livery is _scarlet and gold_. In the Middle Ages, all\r\ngreat families had their own livery colours, which had no necessary\r\nrelation to the tinctures of the shield.\r\n\r\n_Lodged._ A term denoting animals of the chase when at rest or in\r\nrepose, Nos. 25, 26.\r\n\r\n_Lozenge._ A square figure set diagonally, No. 47 (also see page 69).\r\nThe armorial insignia of unmarried ladies and widows, with the sole\r\nexception of a Sovereign, are blazoned on a Lozenge instead of an\r\nEscutcheon.\r\n\r\n_Lozengy._ A field divided lozengewise: No. 145.\r\n\r\n_Luce_, or _Lucy_. The fish now called pike. See page 77 and No. 164.\r\n\r\n_Lure._ See _In Lure_.\r\n\r\n_Lymphad._ An ancient galley, No. 275. It was the feudal ensign of the\r\nScottish lordship of LORN, and as such quartered by the Duke of ARGYLL.\r\n\r\n_Maintenance, Cap of._ See _Chapeau_.\r\n\r\n_Manche_, _Maunche_. A lady's sleeve with a long pendent lappet, worn in\r\nthe time of HENRY I., and borne as an armorial charge by the families of\r\nHASTINGS, CONYERS, and some others. HASTINGS (H. 3)--_Or, a manche gu._:\r\nNo. 276.\r\n\r\n_Mantle._ A flowing robe worn over the armour, or over their ordinary\r\ncostume, by personages of distinction of both sexes: the mantles of\r\nladies were commonly decorated with armorial blazonry.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 275.--Lymphad.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 276.--Arms of Hastings.]\r\n\r\n_Mantling_, or _Lambrequin_. A small mantle of some rich materials,\r\nattached to the knightly basinet or helm, and worn hanging down. It is\r\nusually represented with jagged edges, to represent the cuts to which it\r\nwould be exposed in actual battle: No. 199. (See _Panache_.) Mantlings\r\nblazoned with achievements of arms are sometimes adjusted in folds to\r\nform a background to the composition, and they are also occasionally\r\ndifferenced with various charges.\r\n\r\n_Marquess_, _Marquis_. The second order of the British Peerage, in rank\r\nnext to that of Duke. This rank and title were introduced into England\r\nin 1387, by RICHARD II., who then created his favourite, ROBERT DE VERE,\r\nMarquess of DUBLIN. The next creation was by HENRY VI. A Marquess is\r\n\"Most Honourable\"; he is styled \"My Lord Marquess\": all his younger sons\r\nare \"Lords,\" and his daughters \"Ladies\"; his eldest son bears his\r\nfather's \"second title.\" The Coronet, apparently contemporary in its\r\npresent form with that of Dukes, has its golden circlet heightened with\r\nfour strawberry leaves and as many pearls, arranged alternately: in\r\nrepresentations two of the pearls, and one leaf and two half-leaves are\r\nshown, No. 277. The wife of a Marquess is a \"Marchioness\"; her style\r\ncorresponds with that of her husband, and her coronet is the same.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 277.--Circlet of the Coronet of a Marquess.]\r\n\r\n_Marshalling._ The disposition of more than one distinct coat of arms\r\nupon a shield, so forming a single composition; or the aggroupment of\r\ntwo or more distinct shields, so as to form a single composition; also\r\nthe association of such accessories as the helm, mantling, crest, &c.,\r\nand of knightly and other insignia with a shield of arms, thus again\r\nforming a single heraldic composition. See Chapter XI.\r\n\r\n_Martel._ A hammer.\r\n\r\n_Martlet._ The heraldic Martin, usually represented without feet: Nos.\r\n160, 161, and 70 and 86.\r\n\r\n_Mascle._ Lozenge voided: No. 143. _Masculée._ A field divided\r\nmascle-wise.\r\n\r\n_Masoned._ Representing brickwork.\r\n\r\n_Membered._ To denote the legs of a bird.\r\n\r\n_Merchant's mark._ A device, adopted as early as 1400 by merchants, as a\r\nsubstitute for heraldic ensigns which were not conceded to them. Such\r\nmarks are the predecessors of the _Trade-brands_ and _Marks_ of after\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n_Mermaid_, _Merman_, or _Triton_. The well-known fabulous creatures of\r\nthe sea, borne occasionally as charges, but more frequently as\r\nsupporters, badges, or crests. A mermaid was the device of Sir WILLIAM\r\nDE BRIVERE, who died in 1226, and it is the badge of the BERKELEYS.\r\n\r\n_Metal._ The Tinctures _Or_ and _Argent_: Nos. 50, 51.\r\n\r\n_Mill-rind._ See _Fer-de-Moline_.\r\n\r\n_Mitre._ The ensign of archiepiscopal and episcopal rank, placed above\r\nthe arms of prelates of the Church of England, sometimes borne as a\r\ncharge, and adopted by the BERKELEYS as their crest. The contour of the\r\nmitre has varied considerably at different periods, the early examples\r\nbeing low and concave in their sides, the later lofty and convex. See\r\nNo. 159.\r\n\r\n_Moline._ A cross terminating like a Fer-de-moline, No. 97. In modern\r\ncadency it is the difference of the eighth son.\r\n\r\n_Moon._ No. 166, page 80.\r\n\r\n_Motto._ A word, or very short sentence, placed generally below a shield\r\nbut sometimes above a crest, an idea perhaps derived from the\r\n\"war-cries\" of early times. A motto may be emblematical, or it may have\r\nsome allusion to the person bearing it, or to his name and armorial\r\ninsignia; or it may be the epigrammatic expression of some sentiment in\r\nspecial favour with the bearer of it. As a matter of course, allusive\r\nmottoes, like allusive arms, afford curious examples of mediæval puns.\r\nI give a few characteristic examples:--\"_Vero nil verius_\" (_nothing\r\ntruer than truth_, or, _no greater verity than in Vere_)--VERE; \"_Fare,\r\nfac_\" (_Speak--act_; that is, _a word and blow_)--FAIRFAX; \"_Cave_\"\r\n(_beware_)--CAVE; \"_Cavendo tutus_\" (_safe, by caution_, or _by\r\nCavendish_)--CAVENDISH; \"_Set on_,\" says SETON; \"_Fight on_,\" quoth\r\nFITTON; \"_Festina lente_\" (_On slow--push forward, but be cautious_,\r\nthat is), adds ONSLOW. Again: JEFFERAY says, \"_Je feray ce que je\r\ndiray_\" (_I shall be true to my word_); SCUDAMORE--_Scutum amoris\r\ndivini_ (_the shield of Divine love_); says JAMES--\"_J'aime jamais_\" (_I\r\nlove ever_); says ESTWICK--\"_Est hic_\" (_he is here_); and\r\nPOLE--\"_Pollet virtus_\" (_valour prevails_); and TEV--\"_Tais en temps_\"\r\n(_be silent in time_). The crest of CHARTERIS, an arm with the hand\r\ngrasping a sword, has over it--\"_This our charter is_.\" In his arms the\r\nMarquess CHOLMONDELEY bears _two helmets_, and his motto is--\"_Cassis\r\ntutissima virtus_\" (_valour is the safest helm_); the crest of the\r\nMARTINS of Dorsetshire was an ape, with the significant motto--\"_He who\r\nlooks at Martin's ape, Martin's ape shall look at him!_\" The motto of\r\nPERCEVAL is--\"_Perse valens_\" (_strong in himself_); but, \"_Do no yll_,\"\r\nquoth DOYLE. Some \"lippes,\" as Camden remarks, have a taste for \"this\r\nkind of lettuce.\"\r\n\r\n_Mound._ A globe, encircled and arched over with rich bands, and\r\nsurmounted by a cross-patée, the whole an ensign of the royal estate.\r\nA mound or orb forms part of the regalia, and the same form appears upon\r\nthe intersecting arches of the crown of the SOVEREIGN; and it also\r\nsurmounts the single arch of the coronet of the PRINCE OF WALES: Nos.\r\n234, 289.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 278.--Mullet.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 279.--Mullet, pierced.]\r\n\r\n_Mount._ A green hill.\r\n\r\n_Mullet._ A star, generally of five, but sometimes of six or more points\r\n(if more than five the number to be specified), always formed by right\r\nlines, as No. 278. A mullet is sometimes \"pierced,\" as in No. 279, when\r\nthe tincture of the field is generally apparent through the circular\r\naperture. In modern cadency an unpierced mullet is the difference of the\r\nthird son. See _Estoile_.\r\n\r\n_Mural Crown._ Represents masonry, and is embattled: No. 280.\r\n\r\n_Naiant._ Swimming in fesse. See _Hauriant_.\r\n\r\n_Naissant._ Equivalent to _Issuant_, but applied only to living\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\n_Naval Crown._ Has its circlet heightened with figures of the stern and\r\nthe hoisted sail of a ship alternating: No. 281.\r\n\r\n_Nebulée_, or _Nebuly_.

At the court of\r\nEDWARD II. Sir Gilbert had unadvisedly expressed admiration for ROBERT\r\nBRUCE, on which JOHN LE DESPENCER struck him. Despencer fell in single\r\ncombat the next day, and Hamilton fled, hotly pursued, northward. Near\r\nthe border the fugitive and a faithful esquire joined some wood-cutters,\r\nassumed their dress, and commenced working with them on an oak, when the\r\npursuers passed by. Hamilton, saw in hand, observed his esquire\r\nanxiously watching their enemies as they passed, and at once recalled\r\nhis attention to his woodman's duties by the word, \"Through!\"--thus, at\r\nthe same time, appearing to consider the cutting down the oak to be far\r\nmore important than the presence of the strangers. So they passed by,\r\nand Hamilton followed in safety. This crest does not appear in the\r\nHamilton seals till long after the days of Bruce and his admirer, Sir\r\nGilbert: No. 301.\r\n\r\n_Scarpe_, _Escarpe_.

Before about 1320 the spur had\r\na single point, and was known as the \"pryck-spur\"; about that time\r\nappeared a \"rouelle-spur\" of simple form; in the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury spurs of extravagant length were introduced.\r\n\r\n_SS., Collar of._ See _Collar_, and No. 231.\r\n\r\n_Stafford-knot._ No. 304.\r\n\r\n_Stall-plate._ A plate bearing the arms of a knight and placed in his\r\nstall.

They came gradually into use in the\r\ncourse of the fourteenth century, but were not regularly established as\r\naccessories of Shields till about 1425, or rather later. At first they\r\nwere generally alike, being then duplicate representations of the badge,\r\nbut subsequently the more prevalent custom was that the two Supporters\r\nshould differ, as in the case of the Royal Supporters, the Lion and the\r\nUnicorn, famous in History as in Heraldry. See _Bearer_, _Tenant_, and\r\nalso Chapter XVI.\r\n\r\n_Surcoat._ Any garment worn over armour; but especially the long flowing\r\ngarment worn by knights over their armour until about 1325, when its\r\nform was modified by cutting it short in front, and it was distinguished\r\nas a _Cyclas_. See _Jupon_.\r\n\r\n_Surmounted._ Placed over another.\r\n\r\n_Swan._ When blazoned \"_proper_,\" white with black beak and red legs. It\r\nis the badge of the BOHUNS, and of their descendants the LANCASTRIAN\r\nPLANTAGENETS, the STAFFORDS, and some others.

By HENRY V., the Swan badge of his mother, MARY DE BOHUN, was\r\nborne with the wings expanded.\r\n\r\n_Sword._ When borne as a charge, straight in the blade, pointed, and\r\nwith a cross-guard. All the appointments of the weapon are to be\r\nblazoned. It appears, as a spiritual emblem, in several episcopal coats\r\nof arms; in the arms of the CITY OF LONDON, No. 306, the first quarter\r\nof a Shield of ST. GEORGE (_arg., a cross gu._) is charged with _a sword\r\nerect gules_, the emblem of ST. PAUL, the special patron of the English\r\nmetropolitan city.

Used by French Heralds to distinguish human figures\r\nfrom animals, as _supporters_.\r\n\r\n_Tennée_, or _Tawney_. A deep orange-colour; in use in the Middle Ages\r\nas a _livery-colour_.\r\n\r\n_Thistle._ The national Badge of SCOTLAND, represented after its\r\nnational aspect, and tinctured _proper_. JAMES I. of Great Britain, to\r\nsymbolise the union of the two realms of England and Scotland,\r\ncompounded a Badge from the _Rose_ of one realm, and the _Thistle_ of\r\nthe other, united by impalement under a single crown: No. 308.

First, the bringing together and the disposition of two or more\r\ndistinct \"Coats in one Shield\":\r\n\r\n2. Secondly, the aggroupment of two or more distinct Coats to form a\r\nsingle heraldic composition, the Shields being still kept distinct from\r\none another: and,\r\n\r\n3. Thirdly, the association of certain insignia with a Shield of arms,\r\nso as to produce a complete heraldic achievement.\r\n\r\nThe association of \"Arms\" with Names, Dignities, and Estates would\r\nnecessarily require, at an early period in the history of Heraldry, the\r\nestablishment of some regular and recognised system for the combination\r\nand aggroupment of various distinct coats and insignia, whenever a\r\nsingle individual became the representative of more than one family, or\r\nwas the hereditary possessor of several dignities and properties.\r\n\r\nAgain: it would be equally necessary that this system should extend to\r\nthe becoming heraldic declaration and record of _Alliances_ of every\r\nkind, including (a matter of no little importance in the Middle Ages)\r\n_feudal dependence_.\r\n\r\nIn another, and a secondary sense, this same term, _Marshalling_, is\r\nused by Heralds to denote the general arrangement and disposition of\r\nheraldic charges and insignia in blazon upon the field of a Shield.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 316.--Seal of Margaret, Queen of Edward I.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 317.--Seal of Margaret, Lady de Ros. (_Laing._)]\r\n\r\nIn its simplest form, MARSHALLING is effected by _Aggroupment_ without\r\nCombination--by placing two or more Shields of arms, that is, in such\r\npositions as to form a connected group of distinct Shields, either with\r\nor without various accessories. Seals afford excellent examples of\r\nMarshalling of this order. These Seals may be classified in two\r\ngroups,--one, in which an effigy appears; and a second, in which the\r\ncomposition does not include any effigy. Here I may observe that the\r\nsame armorial blazonry that was displayed upon their military surcoats\r\nby Princes, Nobles, and Knights, was adopted by Ecclesiastics for the\r\ndecoration of their official vestments, and also (towards the close of\r\nthe thirteenth century) by Ladies of rank, as an appropriate style of\r\nornamentation for their own costume: and many examples of the effigies\r\nof Ladies, with a few of Ecclesiatics, adorned in this manner with\r\nheraldic insignia, exist in Seals and in Monumental Memorials. In\r\nBeverley Minster there is a noble effigy of a priest, a member of the\r\ngreat family of PERCY (about A.D. 1330), the embroideries of whose\r\nvestments are elaborately enriched with numerous allied shields of arms.\r\nUpon his episcopal seal, LEWIS BEAUMONT, Bishop of Durham from 1317 to\r\n1333, has his effigy standing between two Shields of Arms (to the\r\ndexter, _England_; to the sinister, a cross potent between four groups\r\nof small crosses patées, three crosses in each group), while his\r\nchasuble is semée de lys and also charged with a lion rampant--the arms\r\nof the house of Beaumont. The obverse of the Seal of MARGARET, daughter\r\nof PHILIP the Hardy, King of France, the second Queen of our EDWARD I.,\r\nillustrates this usage in the instance of ladies: No. 316. Upon her\r\ntunic the Queen has emblazoned the three lions of her royal husband; on\r\nher right side is a shield of _France_, the arms of her royal father;\r\nand on the left side a corresponding shield is charged with a lion\r\nrampant. I have already shown the reverse of this fine Seal (No. 251),\r\nwhich in the original is one inch more in depth than it appears in these\r\nwoodcuts.[5] Other characteristic examples are the Seals of AGNES DE\r\nPERCY, whose effigy, having the arms of Louvaine upon the tunic, holds\r\ntwo armorial shields, one in each hand: and of MARGARET, Countess of\r\nLINCOLN and PEMBROKE (about 1241), who blazons the old arms of DE\r\nLACI--_quarterly or and gu., a bend sa., over all a label vert_--upon\r\nthe tunic of her effigy, and has the same arms on a Shield to the\r\ndexter, while another Shield to the sinister is charged with the _lion\r\nrampant_, borne by the DE LACIES as Earls of LINCOLN. The effigies of\r\nillustrious Ladies, which appear on Seals with allied Shields of arms,\r\nare not always represented in heraldic costume: good examples are the\r\nSeals of ISABELLE OF FRANCE, Queen of EDWARD II., and of ELIZABETH,\r\ndaughter of EDWARD I., who was Countess, first of HOLLAND, and\r\nafterwards of HEREFORD: both are engraved in Sandford's \"Genealogical\r\nHistory of England,\" page 121. The Seal of MARGARET BRUCE, of Skelton,\r\nLady DE ROS, attached to a deed, dated 1820, has the effigy of the noble\r\nlady, wearing her ermine mantle, and supporting two Shields of arms--the\r\nShield of DE ROS, _gu., three water-bougets arg._, to the dexter, and a\r\nShield of BRUCE, _a lion rampant_: No. 317. I am indebted, for the use\r\nof the excellent woodcut of this very interesting seal, to Mr. Laing of\r\nEdinburgh, the talented author of the two noble volumes on the _Early\r\nSeals of Scotland_, which occupy a foremost position amongst the most\r\nvaluable as well as the most beautiful heraldic works that have ever\r\nbeen published in Great Britain. (See page 11.) In the Monumental\r\nBrasses and also in the Sculptured Monumental Effigies of Ladies of the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries, heraldic costume is frequently\r\nrepresented, and the figures are constantly associated with groups of\r\nShields of arms. As most characteristic examples I may specify the\r\neffigy of a Lady, about A.D. 1325, at Selby in Yorkshire; and the Brass\r\nin Westminster Abbey, A.D. 1399, to ALIANORE DE BOHUN, Duchess of\r\nGLOUCESTER.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: In No. 251 the initial A of the word AQVITANNIE has\r\n    been omitted.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 318.--Seal of Joan, Countess of Surrey.]\r\n\r\nThe aggroupment of various armorial ensigns upon a Seal, without the\r\npresence of any effigy, is exemplified in the characteristic Seal of\r\nJOAN, daughter of HENRY Count DE BARRE, and of ALIANORE, daughter of\r\nEDWARD I., the widow of JOHN DE WARRENNE, Earl of SURREY, A.D. 1347. In\r\nthis remarkable composition, No. 318, the arms, blazoned on lozenges,\r\nare, in the centre, _Warrenne_; in chief and base, _England_; and to the\r\ndexter and sinister, _De Barre_ (No. 162): also, at the four angles of\r\nthe group, the lion and castle of _Leon_ and _Castile_, in direct\r\nallusion to the descent of the Countess from ALIANORE, first Queen of\r\nEDWARD I. In the original, this elaborate composition is only one and a\r\nhalf inches in diameter. Still smaller, measuring no more than one and a\r\nquarter inches in diameter, and yet no less rich in either its Heraldry\r\nor its Gothic traceries, is the beautiful little Counter-seal of MARY DE\r\nSAINT PAUL, wife of AYMER DE VALENCE, Earl of PEMBROKE, which is\r\nfaithfully shown on an enlarged scale, in order to render the details\r\nmore effectively, in No. 319. This illustrious lady, who founded\r\nPembroke College, Cambridge, A.D. 1373, was the daughter of GUY DE\r\nCHASTILLON, Count of ST. PAUL, by his wife MARY, daughter of JOHN DE\r\nDREUX, Duke of BRITTANY, and of BEATRICE, sister of EDWARD I. On her\r\nSeal, accordingly, the Countess of Brittany marshals, in the centre, the\r\narms of her husband (_De Valence_: No. 86), and those of her father (_De\r\nChastillon_--_gu., three pallets vair, on a chief or a label of three\r\npoints az._), united upon a single shield by \"Dimidiation\"--a process\r\npresently to be described: to the dexter, the arms of her Royal\r\nrelatives of _England_ are blazoned in a circular compartment: to the\r\nsinister, in a similar compartment, are the fleurs de lys of _France\r\nAncient_, No. 247, at that time so closely allied with the English\r\nlions: and, finally, in a third roundle, in the base of the composition,\r\nare the arms of _De Dreux_ (_chequée or and az., within a bordure\r\ngu.;[6] over all a canton of Brittany_, No. 15, borne by the maternal\r\ngrandfather of the Countess: the legend is, + S . MARIE . DE . SEYN .\r\nPOVL . COMITISSE . PEMPROCHIE. The original impression of this Seal,\r\nfrom which the woodcut, No. 319, was drawn, is appended to a charter,\r\ndated 1347, which is preserved amongst the muniments of Pembroke\r\nCollege. A very good example of the aggroupment of Shields upon a Seal,\r\nunder conditions differing from those that now have been illustrated,\r\nI have already given in No. 204. Another beautiful and most interesting\r\nexample, now unfortunately partially mutilated, is the Seal of MATILDA\r\nof LANCASTER, the wife, first, of WILLIAM DE BURGH, Earl of ULSTER (and\r\nby him mother of ELIZABETH, the wife of Prince LIONEL OF CLARENCE), and,\r\nsecondly, of Sir RALPH DE UFFORD. This seal, of circular form, No. 320,\r\ndisplays to the dexter a shield of _De Burgh_--_or, a cross gu._; to the\r\nsinister, a shield of _Ufford_--_or, a cross engrailed sa._, in the\r\nfirst quarter _a fleur de lys, for difference_: in base there is a\r\nlozenge of _De Chaworth_ (the mother of the Countess was MATILDA DE\r\nCHAWORTH)--_barrulée arg. and gu., an orle of martlets sa._; and in\r\nchief there remains part of another lozenge of _Lancaster_, to complete\r\nthis remarkable heraldic group. Of the legend there remains only . .\r\nILLV MATILD' . . . . SE . . . The introduction of _Badges_, with a\r\nShield or Shields of arms, in the composition of a Seal, is another\r\nvariety of this same system of Marshalling. No. 321, the Seal of OLIVER\r\nDE BOHUN, exemplifies this usage, having the _white swan Badge_ of the\r\nnoble house of BOHUN thrice repeated about the Shield. See No. 114. Also\r\nsee, in the frontispiece, the Seal of Earl RICHARD DE BEAUCHAMP, No.\r\n449, which is described in Section II. of Chapter XXII.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: In No. 319 the bordure of _De Dreux_ in the roundle in\r\n    base is charged with Lions of England, as borne by JOHN DE DREUX;\r\n    but the presence of these in the Seal of the Countess is uncertain.\r\n    See No. 322.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 319.--Seal of Mary, Countess of Pembroke.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 320.--Seal of Matilda of Lancaster.]\r\n\r\nMarshalling by Aggroupment was practised under another form by placing\r\nShields of arms in the different panels of the same architectural\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\nMARSHALLING _by Combination_ is effected by actually forming, for the\r\nblazonry of a single Shield, a composition which includes the principal\r\ncharges of two or more allied Shields. The composition of the Shield\r\nborne by the house of DE DREUX, to which I have just referred in\r\ndescribing the Seal of the Countess of Pembroke, No. 319, is a most\r\nstriking example of this variety of Marshalling: and this Shield was\r\nborne by JOHN DE DREUX, created Earl of RICHMOND by his uncle King\r\nEDWARD I., who lived and died in England, as it is represented in No.\r\n322--the _field, chequée or and azure_, being for De Dreux; the _canton\r\nermine_ for Brittany; and the _bordure, gules charged with golden lions\r\nof England_, representing the royal Shield of England, and showing the\r\nclose connection existing between the Earl of Richmond and his\r\nSovereign. The shield of Prince JOHN of ELTHAM (No. 24), _England within\r\na bordure of France_, is another characteristic example of this\r\nMarshalling by Combination.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 321.--Seal of Oliver de Bohun.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 322.--Shield of Earl John de Dreux.]\r\n\r\nFor many reasons, except in particular instances, these methods of\r\nMarshalling were not considered to be altogether satisfactory.\r\nAccordingly, a fresh arrangement was devised which would preserve intact\r\nthe original integrity of each coat of arms, would imply a definite\r\nsystematic method of arrangement, and would admit into a single\r\ncomposition any required number of distinct coats. This MARSHALLING _by\r\nQuartering_, naturally suggested by such simple bearings as Nos. 16 and\r\n17, consists in dividing the Shield, as in No. 30, into four parts, and\r\nplacing in each of these divisions or quarters one of the coats to be\r\nmarshalled on a single Shield. If two coats only are thus to be\r\n\"_quartered_,\" the most important of the two occupies the first quarter,\r\nand is repeated in the fourth; and, the other coat is placed in the\r\nsecond quarter, and repeated in the third. The earliest example known in\r\nEngland is the quartered Shield of _Castile and Leon--quarterly: first\r\nand fourth, gules, a castle triple-towered or; second and third, argent,\r\na lion rampant gu._, No. 323. This shield is sculptured upon the\r\nmonument in Westminster Abbey to ALIANORE, daughter of FERDINAND III.,\r\nKing of CASTILE and LEON, and Queen of EDWARD I.: the date is 1290. This\r\nform of Marshalling began gradually to be adopted during the first half\r\nof the fourteenth century, and in the second half of that century it\r\nbecame generally adopted. Other examples of quartered shields I have\r\nalready given in Nos. 252 and 253.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 323.--Shield of Castile and Leon.]\r\n\r\nShould there be _three_ Coats to be quartered, they would severally\r\noccupy the first, second, and third quarters of the Shield, in due\r\norder, and the first quarter would be repeated in the fourth. In\r\nquartering _four_ coats, no repetition would be necessary. If more than\r\nfour coats would require to be quartered, the Shield would be divided\r\ninto whatever number of sections might be necessary, as in No. 36, and\r\nthe required arrangement would be made; should any repetition be\r\nnecessary, the first quarter is to be repeated in the fourth. This\r\nprocess, whatever the number of the coats thus marshalled (and their\r\nnumber sometimes is very great), is always entitled \"_quartering_\"; and\r\neach of these divisions of a Shield, for the purpose of Marshalling, is\r\ndistinguished as a \"Quarter.\" Occasionally a _quartered coat_ would have\r\nto be marshalled with others. In the \"grand quartering\" which then takes\r\nplace, the quartered coat is treated precisely as any other member of\r\nthe group. See No. 37. For example, the Shield, No. 324 (R. 2), of\r\nHENRY, first Earl of NORTHUMBERLAND, is--I. and IV. Grand\r\nQuarters,--_first and fourth, or, a lion rampt. az._, for Louvaine, or\r\nPercy modern: _second and third, gu., three lucies haurient arg._ (No.\r\n164) for Lucy: II. and III. Grand Quarters,--_az., five fusils conjoined\r\nin fesse or_, for Percy ancient.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 324.--Shield of Henry, Earl of Northumberland.]\r\n\r\nWhen a Shield to be quartered has a very numerous array of Quarterings,\r\nGrand Quartering is seldom adopted; but, in its stead, the new\r\nquarterings are marshalled in their proper succession, with the original\r\nquarterings of the Shield.\r\n\r\nIn this Marshalling the first quarter is occupied by the most important\r\nquartering, which is determined (without any fixed rule) by the original\r\ngrant or licence: the other quarterings follow, in the order in which\r\nthey may have been \"brought in\" to the composition.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 325.--Shield of Mayor of Winchelsea.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 326.--De Valence, dimidiating Claremont Nesle.]\r\n\r\nTo denote and record ALLIANCE BY MARRIAGE, two distinct Coats were first\r\nmarshalled upon a single Shield by _Dimidiation_. This process is\r\naccomplished in the following manner. The Shield to be charged with the\r\ntwo Coats in union is divided _per pale_, as in No. 28: on the dexter\r\nhalf the corresponding half, or generally somewhat more than that half,\r\nof the arms of the husband is marshalled: then, in like manner, the\r\nsinister half is charged with the corresponding portion of the arms of\r\nthe wife. In the Shield, No. 250, from another Seal of Queen MARGARET,\r\n_England_ dimidiates _France ancient_, Nos. 187 and 247. This\r\nDimidiation in most cases produces a singular effect; as in No. 325,\r\na Shield from the Seal of the Mayor of Winchelsea, one of the famous\r\nSussex Cinque Ports, which bears _England_ dimidiating _azure, three\r\nhulls of ships, in pale, or_: here the dimidiated lions and ships appear\r\nto unite for the purpose of forming the most extravagant of compound\r\nmonsters. The Seal of the Borough of Great Yarmouth substitutes _three\r\nherrings_, in allusion to the staple fishery of the port, for the ships,\r\nand dimidiates them with the national lions. In the central Shield of\r\nthe Seal, No. 319, I have shown _De Valence_ dimidiating _De\r\nChastillon_. In No. 326, from the monument of WILLIAM DE VALENCE, _De\r\nValence_ appears dimidiating the French Coat of _Claremont Nesle_--_gu.,\r\nsemée of trefoils, two barbels haurient addorsed or_: the Dimidiation\r\nhere cuts off and removes one-half of the De Valence martlets and also\r\none of the two barbels of Claremont.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 327.--Camoys, impaling Mortimer.]\r\n\r\nThe characteristic features of one or of both of the united Coats, as I\r\nhave just shown, being commonly rendered indistinct and uncertain by\r\nDimidiation, that form of marshalling was generally superseded by\r\nIMPALEMENT in the course of the third quarter of the fourteenth century.\r\nThis process, at once simple and effectual, marshals the whole of the\r\nhusband's arms on the dexter half of a Shield divided per pale, as No.\r\n28; and the whole of the arms of the wife on the sinister half of it.\r\nSuch an impaled Shield is borne by a husband and wife during their\r\nconjoint lives; and should the wife become a widow, by her the impaled\r\narms are borne during her widowhood charged upon a lozenge. The dexter\r\nhalf only--the husband's arms--of an impaled Shield is hereditary. Fine\r\nexamples of Shields that are both impaled and quartered, are preserved\r\nin the monuments of EDWARD III. and his Queen PHILIPPA, in the Brass to\r\nALIANORE DE BOHUN, and in the monument to MARGARET BEAUFORT, all in\r\nWestminster Abbey. Other fine examples occur on the monument of Earl\r\nRICHARD BEAUCHAMP, at Warwick. No. 327, from the Brass to THOMAS, LORD\r\nCAMOYS, K.G., and his wife, ELIZABETH MORTIMER (the widow of HENRY\r\nHOTSPUR), at Trotton, in Sussex, A.D. 1410, marshals _Camoys_--_arg., on\r\na chief gu. three plates_, impaling _Mortimer_, No. 131. Again, at\r\nWarwick, the Brass to Earl THOMAS DE BEAUCHAMP and his Countess,\r\nMARGARET FERRERS of Groby, A.D. 1406, has a Shield of _Beauchamp_--_gu.,\r\na fesse between six crosslets or_, impaling _Ferrers_--_gu., seven\r\nmascles, three three and one, or_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 328.--D'Aubigny, impaling Scotland.]\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that _Bordures_ and _Tressures_, which are not\r\naffected by Quartering, are _dimidiated by Impalement_,--that is, that\r\nside of both a Bordure and a Tressure which adjoins the line of\r\nImpalement is generally removed: thus, one of the small Shields\r\nsculptured upon the canopy of the monument of Queen MARY STUART, at\r\nWestminster, is charged with _D'Aubigny_ impaling _Scotland_,--that is,\r\n_az., three fleurs de lys or, within a bordure gu. charged with eight\r\nbuckles gold_, impaling No. 138. This Shield, represented in No. 328,\r\nhas both the bordure on its dexter half, and the tressure on its\r\nsinister half, dimidiated by the impalement. There are other excellent\r\nexamples of this partial dimidiating in the monuments of MARGARET TUDOR\r\nand MARGARET BEAUFORT, in the same chapel of Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe husband of an _Heiress_ or a _Co-heiress_, instead of impaling the\r\narms of his wife, marshals them upon his Shield charged as an\r\n_Escutcheon of Pretence_. The son of an heiress, as heir to his maternal\r\ngrandfather through his mother, as well as to his own father, _quarters_\r\non his Shield, and transmits to his descendants, _the arms of both his\r\nparents_, his father's arms generally being in the first quarter. The\r\nShield of RICHARD BEAUCHAMP, K.G., Earl of WARWICK (died in 1439), is a\r\ngood example of the use of an Escutcheon of Pretence; it is represented\r\nin No. 329, drawn from the garter-plate of the Earl, in St. George's\r\nChapel, Windsor. The Earl himself, as his hereditary coat, quarters\r\n_Beauchamp_ with _Newburgh_--_chequée or and az., a chevron erm._: upon\r\nthis, for his Countess, ISABELLE, daughter and heiress of THOMAS LE\r\nDESPENCER, Earl of GLOUCESTER, he marshals an Escutcheon of Pretence\r\ncharged with _De Clare_, No. 124, quartering _Le Despencer_--_quarterly\r\narg. and gu., in the second and third quarters a frette or, over all a\r\nbend sa._ In the monument of this great Earl, at Warwick, upon the\r\nEscutcheon of Pretence the arms of Bohun are quartered with those of\r\nClare and Despencer.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 329.--Shield of Earl Richard Beauchamp.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 330.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 331.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 332.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 333.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 334.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 335.]\r\n\r\nA few very simple diagrams will clearly elucidate the principle of\r\nMarshalling the arms of Husband and Wife. Suppose B (_Baron_) to\r\nrepresent the Husband, and F (_Femme_) the Wife: then, No. 330 B may\r\nrepresent the arms of the Husband, and No. 330 F the arms of the Wife.\r\nIf F be _not_ an heiress, the arms of B and F, as husband and wife, are\r\nborne impaled, as in No. 330 B F; and their son bears No. 330 B only. If\r\nF _be an heiress_, the arms of B and F, as husband and wife, are borne\r\nas in No. 331--the arms of the wife on an Escutcheon of Pretence; and,\r\nin this case, the son of B and F quarters the arms of both his parents,\r\nas No. 332. Now, suppose this son, whose arms are No. 332, to marry a\r\nlady, _not_ an heiress, whose arms are No. 330 F F, he would simply\r\nimpale the arms of his wife, as in No. 333, and his son would bear No.\r\n332 only, as his father bore that quartered shield before his marriage.\r\nBut if the wife of the bearer of No. 332 were to _be an heiress_, he\r\nwould charge the arms of his wife in pretence upon his own hereditary\r\npaternal Shield, as in No. 334; and his son, by this heiress, as before,\r\nwould quarter the arms of both his parents, as in No. 335. It is obvious\r\nthat Marshalling on this system (of which I here give the general\r\noutline) admits of a widely-extended application. Younger sons in all\r\ncases place over all the quarterings of their Shield their own\r\ndistinctive Mark of Cadency, until they inherit some different\r\nquartering from those to which the head of their house is entitled, and\r\nthe quartering itself then forms sufficient difference.\r\n\r\nA _Widower_ who marries again places the arms of both his wives upon any\r\npermanent record, but for ordinary purposes of use, _e.g._ on a seal or\r\ncarriage, bears only the arms of his living wife.\r\n\r\nAn _Unmarried Lady_ bears her paternal arms on a _lozenge_, without any\r\nHelmet, Crest, or Motto.\r\n\r\nA _Widow_ bears on a _lozenge_ the arms borne by her husband and\r\nherself. Should she marry again, a Widow ceases to bear the arms of her\r\nformer husband.\r\n\r\nA _Peeress in her own right_, if married to a Peer, has both her own\r\narms and those of her husband fully blazoned, and the lozenge and the\r\nShield, with all their accessories, are marshalled to form a single\r\nunited group, the achievement of the husband having precedence to the\r\ndexter. If married to a Commoner, a Peeress in her own right bears her\r\nown arms on a lozenge as before, and her husband marshals her arms\r\nensigned with her coronet in pretence on his Shield: and this lozenge\r\nand Shield are grouped together, the lozenge yielding precedence.\r\n\r\n_Prelates_ bear the arms of their see impaling their own paternal and\r\nhereditary arms, the insignia of the see occupying the dexter half of\r\nthe Shield, this Shield being ensigned with a mitre only. A married\r\nPrelate bears also a second Shield, placed to the sinister of the other,\r\non which are marshalled, in accordance with ordinary usage, his own\r\npersonal arms with those of his wife. The mitre then is placed over the\r\nconjoined shields.\r\n\r\nThe _Kings of Arms_, in like manner, bear two Shields, disposed to form\r\na single group: on the dexter Shield their official arms impale their\r\npersonal; and on the sinister Shield their personal arms are marshalled\r\nwith the arms of their wives.\r\n\r\nAgain, the same usage obtains in marshalling the arms of _Knights of\r\nOrders of Knighthood_ who, when married, bear two Shields grouped\r\ntogether. On the dexter Shield are blazoned the arms of the Knight\r\nhimself alone; and around this Shield are displayed the insignia of his\r\nOrder, or Orders, of Knighthood: and on the sinister Shield the arms of\r\nthe Knight and of his wife are marshalled, but without the knightly\r\ninsignia. This second Shield is generally environed with decorative\r\nfoliage. This usage, prevalent in England, is not accepted or adopted by\r\nforeign Heralds: nor does it appear to be required by true heraldic\r\nprinciple, or to be strictly in accordance with it. The wife of a Knight\r\nshares his knightly title, and takes precedence from her husband's\r\nknightly rank; and a knight, with perfect heraldic consistency, might\r\nmarshal his own knightly insignia about the Shield which is charged with\r\nhis own arms and those of his wife, whether united by impalement, or\r\nwhen the latter are borne in pretence: and thus a single Shield would be\r\nborne, and there would cease to exist any motive for endeavouring to\r\nimpart to a second Shield some general resemblance to its companion by\r\nwreaths or other unmeaning accessories. There are ancient precedents for\r\nthe use of a single shield.\r\n\r\n_Official Arms_ are not hereditary.\r\n\r\n_Royal Personages_, when married, bear their own arms on a separate\r\nShield; and a second Shield bears the arms of the husband and wife\r\nconjoined.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of every case must exercise a considerable influence\r\nin determining the Marshalling of the Accessories of any Shield,\r\nLozenge, or Group. As a general rule, however, the _Helm_ always rests\r\non the chief of the Shield: Commoners, Knights, Baronets, and Peers\r\nplace their _Crest_ upon the Helm: Peers and Princes place their _Helm_\r\nupon the Coronet, and their Crest is placed upon the Helmet. The\r\nSOVEREIGN places the Crest upon the Royal Crown, which is a part of the\r\nRoyal Crest, and it is unusual to duplicate the Crown by repeating it\r\nbelow the Helmet. The _Mantling_ is displayed from the back of the Helm:\r\nit is most effective when simple in its form and adjustment, and when it\r\ndroops behind the Shield. The _Motto_ is usually placed below the\r\nShield; but if it has special reference to the Crest, above the Crest.\r\nA Scottish motto always goes over the Crest. _Supporters_ are usually\r\nplaced erect, as if in the act of really supporting the Shield: they\r\nought to stand either on an appropriate ground, or on a Gothic basement\r\nto the entire Achievement. _Badges_, with all _Official_ and _Knightly\r\nInsignia_, and all other _Honourable Insignia_ of every kind, are\r\nrightly marshalled in an Achievement of Arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCADENCY\r\n\r\n  _Marks of Cadency are temporary or permanent-- The Label-- The\r\n  Bordure-- The Bendlet, Barrulet, and Canton-- Change of Tincture--\r\n  Secondary Charges-- Single Small Charges-- Differences of\r\n  Illegitimacy-- Cadency of Crests, Badges, &c.-- Modern Cadency._\r\n\r\n  \"Merke ye wele theys questionys here, now folowying!\"\r\n    --BOKE OF ST. ALBANS, A.D. 1486.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst his comrades in arms, or in the midst of a hostile array, the\r\nlast object that a mediæval Knight would expect or desire to observe, on\r\nthe morning of a battle or a joust, would be an exact counterpart of\r\nhimself. Occasions, indeed, might sometimes arise, when it might be\r\nhighly desirable that five or six counterfeit \"Richmonds\" should\r\naccompany one real one to \"the field\"; or, when a \"wild boar of\r\nArdennes\" might prefer to encounter the hunters, having about him the\r\nchoice of his own \"boar's brood,\" garnished at all points exactly after\r\nhis own fashion. These, however, are rare and strictly exceptional\r\ncases. And the Knight, to whom distinction was as the breath of his\r\nnostrils, as he closed his vizor trusted confidently to his heraldic\r\ninsignia to distinguish him, while, in the fore-front of the fray, with\r\nsword and lance and axe he would strive manfully to distinguish himself.\r\nThis implies that Heraldry, besides assigning to different families\r\ntheir own distinct insignia, should possess the faculty of\r\ndistinguishing the several members, and also the various branches of the\r\nsame family, the one from the other. A faculty such as this Heraldry\r\ndoes possess, in its marks of CADENCY.\r\n\r\nIn \"_marking Cadency_\"--that is, in distinguishing the armorial insignia\r\nof kinsmen, who are members of the very same family, or of some one of\r\nits various branches, it is a necessary condition of every system of\r\n\"Differencing\" that, while in itself clear and definite and significant,\r\nit should be secondary to the leading characteristics of the original\r\nCoat of Arms which denotes the senior branch of the Family, and also\r\ndeclares from what fountain-head all the kinsmen of all the branches\r\nhave derived their common descent.\r\n\r\nVarious methods for thus marking Cadency were adopted, and accepted as\r\nsatisfactory, in the early days of Heraldry. Of these I now shall\r\ndescribe and illustrate such as are most emphatic in themselves, and in\r\ntheir character most decidedly heraldic,--such also as most\r\nadvantageously may be retained in use in our own Heraldry of the present\r\ntime. It will be seen that the \"Differences\" which mark Cadency\r\nnecessarily resolve themselves into two groups or classes: one, in which\r\nthe \"Difference\" is _temporary_ only in its significance and use,--as,\r\nwhen an eldest son, on the death of his father, succeeds to the position\r\nin the family which his father had held, he removes his Mark of Cadency\r\nas eldest son from his Shield, assumes the unmarked Shield as his father\r\nhad borne it before him, and transfers to his own son the mark that\r\npreviously had distinguished his Shield from that of his father. In the\r\nother group, the Marks of Cadency are more _permanent_, and consequently\r\nmay become integral elements of the heraldic composition in which they\r\nappear: thus, the mark of Cadency which distinguishes any particular\r\nbranch of a family, is borne alike by all the members of that branch,\r\nand in that branch it is transmitted from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nMore than one Mark of Cadency may be introduced into the same Coat of\r\nArms; and, for the purpose of some form of secondary distinction, it is\r\nquite correct Heraldry to _mark Marks of Cadency_--to charge one variety\r\nof mark, that is, upon another.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 336.--Eldest Sons of Edward I. and II.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 337.--Black Prince.]\r\n\r\nThe LABEL, Nos. 271, 272, is blazoned as a Mark of Cadency in the\r\nearliest Rolls of Arms, and it appears discharging this duty in the\r\nearliest examples. The Label is generally borne with three points, as in\r\nNo. 271; frequently with five, as in No. 272; and occasionally with four\r\nor with more than five points. It is quite certain that no significance\r\nwas formerly attached to the number of the points, the object in all\r\ncases being to make the Label distinctly visible, and to adjust the\r\npoints to the general composition of the Shield. Labels are of various\r\ntinctures. EDWARD I., EDWARD II., and EDWARD III., each one during the\r\nlifetime of his father, bore the Shield of England, No. 187, differenced\r\nwith an _azure label_, sometimes of three points, as in No. 336, and\r\nsometimes having five points. EDWARD the BLACK PRINCE marked the Royal\r\nShield of EDWARD III. with a _label argent_, as in No. 337; and a plain\r\nsilver label has since been the Mark of Cadency of every succeeding\r\nheir-apparent to the English throne. The Label has been used in this\r\nmanner by personages of all ranks who have borne arms, from the time of\r\nHENRY III.; and examples abound in all the early Rolls of Arms, in\r\nMonuments, and upon Seals.\r\n\r\nThe _Label_, borne as a Mark of Cadency, was sometimes, particularly in\r\nthe cases of junior members of the Royal Family, charged with other\r\nfigures and devices, as differences of a secondary rank. Or, when it is\r\nthus charged, the charges upon a Label may be considered to be elements\r\nof the Label itself, in its capacity of a Mark of Cadency. EDMOND, the\r\nfirst Earl of LANCASTER, as I have already shown, No. 249, differenced\r\nhis father's Arms of England with a _Label of France_, No. 338--an azure\r\nlabel, that is, charged with golden fleurs de lys, to denote his French\r\nalliance; and thus by the same process he was Marshalling and Marking\r\nCadency. JOHN OF GHENT, Duke of LANCASTER, differenced with an _ermine\r\nLabel_, No. 339, derived from the ermine shield of Brittany (No. 15):\r\nand the Plantagenet Dukes of YORK charged each point of their silver\r\nLabel with _three torteaux_, No. 340, which may be considered to have\r\nbeen derived from the shield of Wake (No. 82). In order to show them on\r\na larger scale, the Labels in Nos. 338-343 are represented without the\r\nShields on which they were charged. All these Shields would be\r\nrepetitions of the same blazonry of France and England quarterly: Nos.\r\n252 and 253.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 338.--Lancaster.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 339.--Brittany.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 340.--York.]\r\n\r\nThe Label, with various Differences, has generally been the Royal Mark\r\nof Cadency; and now differenced silver Labels are borne, to mark\r\nCadency, by every member of our Royal Family.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 341.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 342.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 343.]\r\n\r\nLike the points of Labels, the Charges blazoned on those points had no\r\nfixed or determinate numbers. That both the Labels and their Charges\r\nshould be distinct and conspicuous, was the special object with which\r\nthey were blazoned. Accordingly, in different examples of the same Label\r\nthe number of the repetitions of the Charges sometimes is found to\r\ndiffer. At the same time, in the earliest examples of charged Labels,\r\nthe repetitions of the Charges, while devoid of any special differencing\r\naim or meaning, may be considered to have been suggested by the sources\r\nfrom which the Charges themselves were derived. For example: the Label\r\nof Lancaster, No. 338, of Earl EDMOND, derived directly from the Shield\r\nof _France ancient_, No. 247, with its field _semée de lys_, has three\r\nfleurs de lys upon each point, so that this Label has the appearance of\r\nbeing also _semée de lys_. Had it been derived from the Shield of\r\n_France modern_, No. 248, charged with three fleurs de lys only,\r\na single fleur de lys in all probability would have been blazoned on\r\neach of the three points of this same Label. Upon this principle the\r\nLabel of Prince LIONEL, DUKE of CLARENCE, second son of EDWARD III.,\r\nwhich is differenced with _cantons gules_, has a single canton on each\r\npoint, as in No. 341, evidently because only a single canton can be\r\nblazoned on a Shield. The figures and devices that are charged for\r\nsecondary difference upon Labels vary widely in their character; but,\r\nhowever difficult it now may be in very many instances to trace these\r\ndifferencing charges to their sources, and so to determine the motive\r\nwhich led to their adoption, there can be no doubt that originally they\r\nwere chosen and adopted for the express purpose of denoting and\r\nrecording some alliance or dependency. Some early Labels are of a\r\ncompound character; that is, they are charged with two distinct groups\r\nof devices, which are at once divided and conjoined by impalement. Such\r\na Label was borne by Prince HENRY, son of JOHN of GHENT, between the\r\ntime of his father's death and his own accession as HENRY IV. (Feb. 3 to\r\nSept. 30, 1399): it was a _Label of five points per pale of Brittany and\r\nLancaster_, No. 342, being his father's Label impaling that of his\r\nmother's father. The second son of this Prince, THOMAS Duke of CLARENCE,\r\ninstead of adopting impalement, charged _a red canton upon each point of\r\nan ermine Label_, as in No. 343: while his brother, JOHN Duke of\r\nBEDFORD, bore their father's Label, No. 342.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 344.--Holland, of Kent.]\r\n\r\nThe BORDURE, both plain and charged, is a Mark of Cadency borne by\r\nPrinces and by personages of various ranks. EDMOND, youngest son of\r\nEDWARD I., differenced _England_ with a plain _silver bordure_, as in\r\nNo. 344: the HOLLANDS, Earls of KENT, did the same: and the same silver\r\nbordure also was borne by THOMAS, youngest son of EDWARD III., about the\r\nquartered shield of _France ancient and England_; and about the\r\nquartered shield of _France modern and England_ by HUMPHREY, youngest\r\nson of HENRY IV. Prince JOHN of ELTHAM, as I have already shown, and\r\nafter him the HOLLANDS, Dukes of EXETER, differenced _England with a\r\nBordure of France_: No. 24. Though not so numerous as Labels, Bordures\r\nemployed to mark Cadency exist in very many early examples, and a\r\nvariety of devices appear charged upon them for secondary Difference.\r\nSee No. 140. In the Royal Heraldry of our own times the Bordure is not\r\nused as a Royal Difference; but its use is retained in Scotland for\r\ndifferencing Shields of less exalted rank.\r\n\r\nIn some few early Examples a BENDLET is charged upon the paternal shield\r\nas a mark of Cadency: and a BARRULET is found to have been also used for\r\nthe same purpose. Thus, HENRY, second son of EDMOND the first Earl of\r\nLANCASTER, during the lifetime of his elder brother, differenced\r\n_England_ with an _azure Bendlet_, as in No. 345: and, in the Seal of\r\nHENRY DE PERCY, son and heir of HENRY third Baron, the lion is\r\ndebruised, for Difference, by a Barrulet which crosses the Shield in the\r\nhonour-point. Possibly, this Barrulet may be a _Label without points_.\r\nA CANTON, plain, or more frequently charged, and in many examples of\r\nermine, is also added to Shields to mark Cadency, but more frequently\r\nnowadays its use denotes absence of blood descent. See Nos. 128, 129,\r\n130.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 345.--Henry of Lancaster.]\r\n\r\nTo mark Cadency by a _change of Tinctures_ was a simple expedient, and\r\nsuch a one as would naturally be practised at an early period. It was\r\neffected, first, in the case of the _Field_: thus (H. 3) the brothers DE\r\nLA ZOUCHE severally bear--_Gu., bezantée_, and, _Az., bezantée_; and the\r\nbrothers FURNIVAL (H. 3) bear--_Arg., a bend between six martlets gu._,\r\nand, _Or, a bend between six martlets gu._ Secondly, the change is\r\neffected in the _Charges_: thus, two William BARDOLFS (H. 3 and E. 2)\r\nseverally bear--_Az., three cinquefoils or_, and, _Az., three\r\ncinquefoils arg._ Thirdly, the tinctures are _reversed_: for example,\r\nfor two Sir JOHN HARCOURTS (E. 2)--_Gu., two bars or_, and, _Or, two\r\nbars gu._ Fourthly, there is a complete change in _all the tinctures_:\r\nand so, while Sir ANDREW LOTEREL (E. 2) bears--_Or, a bend between six\r\nmartlets sa._, Sir GEFFREY LOTEREL (E. 2) bears--_Az., a bend between\r\nsix martlets argent_. Finally, this system of marking Cadency admits\r\nvarious modifications of the changes already described: thus, in the\r\nArms of Mortimer, No. 131, _gules_ is substituted for _azure_; and,\r\nagain, in the same Shield an _inescutcheon ermine_ takes the place of\r\nthe _inescutcheon argent_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 346.--Beauchamp of Elmely.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 347.--Beauchamp at Carlaverock.]\r\n\r\nAnother and a favourite method of marking Cadency, calculated to\r\nexercise a great and decided influence in the development of heraldic\r\nblazon, is the _addition of secondary Charges_ of small size (not on a\r\nLabel or a Bordure but) semée over the field of a Shield, or charged\r\nupon an Ordinary, or disposed in orle. In a large number of examples,\r\nthese small charges are found to have been gradually reduced to six or\r\nthree, in order to admit of their being blazoned on a somewhat larger\r\nscale, and consequently made more distinct. Again: while the number and\r\nthe tinctures of the secondary differencing charges remain the same, in\r\norder to carry out the Cadency still farther the secondary charges\r\nthemselves are varied: and, once more, in other cases the identity of\r\nthe original secondary charges is retained, but their number is\r\nincreased or diminished. I must be content to illustrate these various\r\nforms of Cadency with a few examples only. First, a group of shields of\r\nthe BEAUCHAMPS:--Beauchamp of Elmely (H. 3)--_Gu., a fesse or_, No. 346:\r\nBeauchamp at Carlaverock--_Gu., crusilée and a fesse or_, No. 347:\r\nBeauchamp, Earl of Warwick--_Gu., a fesse between six crosses crosslets\r\nor_, No. 348: and Beauchamp of Bletshoe--_Gu., a fesse between six\r\nmartlets or_, No. 349. Second, a corresponding group of shields of the\r\nBERKELEYS:--Maurice de Barkele (or Berkeley)--_Gu., a chevron arg._\r\n(H. 3): and then for other Berkeleys--_Gu., a chevron between ten\r\ncrosses pattées, six and four, arg._; and the same Ordinary, with either\r\n_ten cinquefoils of silver_, or the same number of _white roses_. Three\r\nCORBETS bear severally (E. 2)--_Or, a raven sa._; _Or, two ravens sa._;\r\nand, _Or, three ravens sa._ And, once more, their original Shield--_Gu.,\r\na chevron or_, is differenced by the COBHAMS by charging the Ordinary\r\nwith three lioncels, three eaglets, three crosslets, three mullets,\r\nthree estoiles, three crescents, or three fleurs de lys, all of them\r\nsable. The particular devices and figures selected thus to mark Cadency,\r\nlike those charged upon Labels or Bordures, must be considered to have a\r\nspecial significance of their own, though this significance may\r\nfrequently fail to be discerned in consequence of our being no longer\r\nable to trace out their association with the sources from which they\r\nwere obtained. The alliances and the incidents that give these various\r\nMarks of Cadency, when it is possible to ascertain what they may have\r\nbeen, illustrate in a striking manner the motives by which the early\r\nHeralds were influenced when they differenced the Arms of Kinsmen.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 348.--Beauchamp of Warwick.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 349.--Beauchamp of Bletshoe.]\r\n\r\n_Official Insignia_ sometimes become Marks of Cadency. Thus, JOHN DE\r\nGRANDISON, Bishop of Exeter (A.D. 1327-1369), on the bend in his\r\npaternal arms, No. 89, substitutes a _golden mitre_ for the central\r\neaglet, as in No. 350. WILLIAM COURTENAY, Archbishop of Canterbury (A.D.\r\n1381-1396), adopts a different course, and charges three golden mitres\r\nupon each point of the Label of Courtenay--_Or, three torteaux, over all\r\na label of three points az. charged on each point with as many mitres\r\ngold_. And again, HENRY LE DESPENCER, Bishop of Norwich (A.D.\r\n1370-1406), places about his paternal shield an _azure bordure charged\r\nwith eight golden mitres_ (see the largest shield in No. 351). On his\r\nofficial seal the canopied effigy of the Bishop stands between this, his\r\npersonal Shield, and the Shield of his see--_az., three mitres or_: but\r\nhis Secretum, or private seal, is much more interesting, as an heraldic\r\nimage of the man himself. Haughty, fierce, cruel, and pugnacious, his\r\ncareer not less inglorious as a military commander than as a churchman,\r\nthis HENRY LE DESPENCER, a grandson of the unhappy favourite of the no\r\nless hapless EDWARD II., was one of the war-loving prelates who\r\noccasionally appear sustaining a strange, and yet as it would seem a\r\ncharacteristic, part in the romantic drama of mediæval history. His\r\nSecretum, No. 351, displays his Shield of _Despencer_, differenced with\r\nhis bordure of mitres, couché from a large mantled helm, surmounted by a\r\nmitre, in place of a crest-coronet, which supports the Despencer crest,\r\na silver griffin's head of ample size; on either side are the Shields of\r\nthe _see of Norwich_, and of _Ferrers_ (the Bishop's mother was Anne,\r\ndaughter of WILLIAM Lord FERRERS of Groby)--_Or, seven mascles, three\r\nthree and one, gu._; the legend is, S . HENRICI . DESPENCER .\r\nNORWICENSIS . EPISCOPI.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 350.--Bishop Grandison.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 351.--Secretum of Bishop le Despencer.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 352.--Sir Fulk Fitz Warin.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 353.--Thomas le Scrope.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 354.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 355.]\r\n\r\nAt an early period, Cadency was marked by _adding a single small charge_\r\nto the blazon of a Shield, or by charging some secondary device or\r\nfigure upon any accessory of a Shield of arms. Such a Mark of Cadency as\r\nthis, obtained from some allied Shield, and charged upon an ordinary or\r\nprincipal bearing, or occupying a conspicuous position in the general\r\ncomposition, was in high favour with the Heralds of both the fourteenth\r\nand fifteenth centuries. From the early examples, which exist in great\r\nnumbers and in as great variety, it will be sufficient for me to adduce\r\nonly a few specimens--a single example, indeed, illustrates the system.\r\nThe Shield of _Ufford_, in the Seal of MATILDA of LANCASTER, which I\r\nhave already described (No. 320), is thus differenced with a single\r\nfleur de lys in the first quarter. Precisely in the same manner Sir FULK\r\nFITZ WARIN differences the Shield of the head of his house, No. 17, by\r\ncharging a _mullet sable_ upon the first quarter, as in No. 352. THOMAS\r\nLE SCROPE, on the other hand, for Cadency marks the golden bend upon his\r\nazure Shield, No. 111, with an _annulet sable_, as in No. 353. Two\r\nmembers of the family of Beauchamp charge their golden fesse (see Nos.\r\n346-349), the one with a _crescent sable_, and the other with a _pierced\r\nmullet_ of the same tincture: Nos. 354, 355. In like manner, in addition\r\nto various labels, the NEVILLES charge no less than eight different\r\nsmall figures upon their silver saltire, No. 121, to distinguish\r\ndifferent members and branches of their powerful race: I give one of\r\nthese Shields in No. 356, which was borne by GEORGE NEVILLE, Lord\r\nLATIMER, from the monument to Earl RICHARD DE BEAUCHAMP at\r\nWarwick--_Gu., on a saltire arg. a gimmel-ring az._: another differenced\r\nshield of Neville, No. 357, has _a cinquefoil_ charged on the saltire:\r\na third example from this group I have already given, No. 122,\r\ndifferenced with _a rose_: this shield, No. 122, is now borne by the\r\nEarl of ABERGAVENNY. Once more: Sir WILLIAM DE BREWYS (E. 2)\r\nbears--_Az., crusilée and a lion rampt. or_, No. 358, which coat another\r\nSir WILLIAM DE BREWYS differences, to distinguish himself from his\r\nkinsman, while at the same time declaring their near relationship, by\r\nsimply charging a _red fleur de lys_ upon his lion's shoulder.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 356.--Lord Latimer.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 357.--Neville.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 358.--Sir William de Brewys.]\r\n\r\nDifferences of Illegitimacy, which rightly and indeed necessarily are\r\nincluded under the general head of \"Cadency,\" do not appear at any time\r\nto have assumed a definite or decided character, and yet they bring\r\nbefore the student of Heraldry much curious matter for inquiry and\r\ninvestigation. Early in the true heraldic era illegitimate sons are\r\nfound to have differenced their paternal arms, as other sons lawfully\r\nborn might have done: and it does not appear that any peculiar methods\r\nof differencing were adopted, palpably for the purpose of denoting\r\nillegitimacy of birth, before the fourteenth century had drawn near to\r\nits close. And even then, if any express heraldic rule on this point\r\never was framed, which is very doubtful, it certainly was never observed\r\nwith any care or regularity.\r\n\r\nThe earliest known example of the arms of a man of illegitimate birth is\r\nthe fine Shield of WILLIAM LONGESPÉE, Earl of SALISBURY, son of\r\nHENRY II. and FAIR ROSAMOND, No. 197. This Shield is supposed to have\r\nbeen assumed and borne by the Earl on his marriage with the daughter and\r\nheiress of D'EVREUX, when in right of his wife he succeeded to the\r\nEarldom of Salisbury: but this theory does not rest upon any solid\r\nfoundation, since it would be very difficult to show that the Shield\r\nwith the six lioncels was certainly borne, on his armorial ensign, by\r\nthe father-in-law of Earl William. Also, if a Shield charged with an\r\nescarbuncle and many lioncels, which has been assigned to GEOFFREY Count\r\nof ANJOU, was really borne by the Founder of the House of PLANTAGENET,\r\nEarl WILLIAM LONGESPÉE may have derived his own Shield from his paternal\r\ngrandfather. Upon his Counterseal the Earl displays his own \"long sword\"\r\nas his proper device. In like manner, certain other personages, also\r\nillegitimate, appear to have borne arms which were either expressly\r\nassigned to themselves by the Sovereign, or such as they assumed in\r\nright of their mothers or wives. In all such cases as these, the Arms\r\nwere not the paternal coat in any way differenced, but what now would be\r\ndesignated \"fresh grants.\" Towards the beginning of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, however, a peculiar kind of Differencing for Illegitimacy\r\ngradually prevailed throughout Europe: thus, illegitimate children\r\neither altered the position of the charges in their paternal Shield; or\r\nthey marshalled the entire paternal arms upon a bend or a fesse; or they\r\ncomposed for themselves a fresh Shield, either using their father's\r\nbadges and the actual charges of his Shield, or adopting devices\r\nevidently derived from the paternal bearings; or they bore the paternal\r\nShield differenced in a peculiarly conspicuous manner with certain marks\r\nby which they might be readily and certainly distinguished.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 359.--Henry, Earl of Worcester.]\r\n\r\nWhen the composition of the paternal Shield would admit of such an\r\narrangement, the field not being argent, an illegitimate son sometimes\r\nbore his father's arms marshalled fesse-wise, so as to leave both the\r\nchief and the base of his Shield plain white. HENRY, Earl of WORCESTER,\r\nwhose father was an illegitimate son of HENRY BEAUFORT, third Duke of\r\nSOMERSET, bore the arms of Beaufort couped in this manner in chief and\r\nin base, as if they were charged upon a very broad fesse on the field:\r\nNo. 359.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 360.--Beaufort before 1397.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 361.--Beaufort after 1397.]\r\n\r\nJOHN DE BEAUFORT (great-grandfather of HENRY, Earl of WORCESTER), eldest\r\nillegitimate son of Prince JOHN of GHENT, _before_ the Act for his\r\nlegitimation was passed in the year 1397, bore his father's hereditary\r\narms of _Lancaster_--_England with a label of France_, No. 249--_on a\r\nbroad bend_, the field being _per pale arg. and az._, the Lancastrian\r\nlivery colours: No. 360. After their legitimation act had become a law,\r\nthis same JOHN DE BEAUFORT, with his brothers, sons, and grandsons, bore\r\nthe Royal quartered shield of France and England, No. 361, differenced,\r\nnot with labels, but with _a bordure componée arg. and az._ (the\r\nLancastrian colours): the different members of the Beaufort family\r\nslightly varied the bordure, but by the head of their house it was borne\r\nas in No. 361. It will be seen that this is the coat that HENRY, Earl of\r\nWORCESTER (himself the legitimate son of an illegitimate son), bore\r\nfesse-wise, as in No. 359. The father of this Earl HENRY, CHARLES\r\nSOMERSET, Earl of WORCESTER (illegitimate son of the third Duke of\r\nSOMERSET), differenced _Beaufort_, No. 361, with a _silver bendlet\r\nsinister_, as in No. 362, the bendlet covering the quarterings, but\r\nbeing included within the bordure.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 362.--Charles, Earl of Worcester.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 363.--Sir Roger de Clarendon.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 364.--Radolphus de Arundel.]\r\n\r\nSince the fifteenth century, in English Heraldry, a narrow bendlet or\r\nbaton sinister, couped at its extremities, either plain or charged, has\r\nusually been the mark employed as difference by the illegitimate\r\ndescendants of the Royal Family. It was borne by ARTHUR PLANTAGENET,\r\nViscount LISLE, son of EDWARD IV.: by HENRY FITZ ROY, Duke of RICHMOND,\r\nson of HENRY VIII., and, variously differenced, by illegitimate\r\ndescendants of CHARLES II.--that is, it is borne at the present day,\r\n_argent_, by the Duke of BUCCLEUCH; _ermine_, by the Duke of CLEVELAND;\r\n_componée arg. and az._, by the Duke of GRAFTON; and, _gules charged\r\nwith three white roses_, by the Duke of ST. ALBANS.\r\n\r\nSir ROGER DE CLARENDON, illegitimate son of the BLACK PRINCE, bore _on a\r\nsable bend the three Ostrich Feathers_ of his illustrious father's\r\n\"_Shield of Peace_,\" the field of his Shield being golden, as in No.\r\n363. Here the \"Difference for Illegitimacy\" is very emphatically marked\r\nin a singularly felicitous and beautiful Shield.\r\n\r\nThe paternal arms of illegitimate children have also sometimes been\r\ncarried by them charged on a _canton_, either dexter or sinister, the\r\nrest of the Shield being left blank, or perhaps in some cases displaying\r\nthe maternal arms; of this usage I am not able to give any good example,\r\nin English Heraldry, of certain authority: one other variety of these\r\nsingular Shields, however, I must add to my small group of examples,\r\nwhich was first noticed by Mr. MONTAGU (\"Guide to the Study of\r\nHeraldry,\" p. 44). This is the Shield, No. 364, of RADOLPHUS DE ARUNDEL;\r\nand it bears the quartered arms of the Earls of ARUNDEL--_Fitz Alan_ and\r\n_Warrenne_ (_gu. a lion rampt. or_, and No. 68), \"_flanched_,\"--that is,\r\nblazoned only upon the flanches (see No. 141) of the Shield, the central\r\narea being blank.\r\n\r\nFor a lengthy period the use of the _bend_, _bendlet_, and _baton\r\nsinister_ was usual for the purpose of denoting illegitimacy, but this\r\nhas now given way to the use, in England, of a _bordure wavy_; in\r\nScotland, of a _bordure compony_; whilst in Ireland both these\r\n_bordures_ are used, more usually, however, the _bordure wavy_ being\r\nemployed. By a curious divergence the _bordure wavy_ is not a mark of\r\nillegitimacy in Scotland, but a mark of perfectly legitimate cadency.\r\nThe use of the _bendlet sinister_ for the debruising of crests still\r\nexists in England and Ireland, but crests are not usually differenced\r\nfor any reason in Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn treating of this subject, some writers have maintained that the\r\n_bordure componée_ is, in its heraldic nature, the most decided and\r\nunquestionable Difference for Illegitimacy: and this opinion these\r\nwriters have derived from the singularly contradictory fact, that the\r\nBEAUFORTS differenced with a bordure componée when they became legally\r\n_legitimate_. A bordure componée _may_, indeed, be used with such an\r\nintention, as it is used by the Duke of RICHMOND, who bears the arms of\r\nCHARLES II. within a _bordure componée arg. and gu., charged with eight\r\nroses of the last_; but by the BEAUFORTS it was used with an intention\r\nexactly the reverse of this. The bordure, however, whatever its aspect\r\nor modification of treatment, remains still, as it was of old, an\r\nhonourable Difference, until some abatement of honour has been\r\nassociated with its presence under special circumstances. But the\r\nstereotyped use of the _bordure wavy_ in England with a set meaning,\r\ngives to the wavy variety a lack of desirability. Marks of illegitimacy\r\nare intended to remain upon a shield for all time, although in a few\r\nhistoric cases their use has been discarded. And precisely the same\r\nwords may be applied to any other charge that has been employed, or may\r\nbe required to mark Cadency.\r\n\r\nMarks of Cadency, as they are borne on Shields of Arms, may also be\r\ncharged on Badges, Crests, and Supporters. As a matter of course, they\r\nappear on Armorial Banners and Standards under the same conditions that\r\nthey are blazoned upon Shields and Surcoats. Such examples as may be\r\nnecessary to illustrate heraldic usage in these cases, I propose to\r\ndescribe in the following Chapters.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be necessary for me to adduce any arguments in order to\r\nimpress upon Students of Heraldry the importance of investigating early\r\nCadency, or to assure them that a special interest is inseparable from\r\nthis inquiry: I may suggest, however, that it is most desirable that\r\nStudents should arrange groups of allied Shields, and should carefully\r\nblazon them with their various \"Marks of Cadency,\" being careful also to\r\nrecord their authorities for every example.\r\n\r\nMODERN CADENCY is marked by the Label and by single small Charges, which\r\ntake precedence in the following order:--\r\n\r\n  1. The _Label_, No. 271.\r\n  2. The _Crescent_, No. 166, A.\r\n  3. The _Mullet_, No. 278.\r\n  4. The _Martlet_, No. 161.\r\n  5. The _Annulet_, No. 154.\r\n  6. The _Fleur de lys_, No. 246.\r\n  7. The _Rose_, No. 298.\r\n  8. The _Cross Moline_, No. 99.\r\n  9. The _Octofoil_, or _Double Quatrefoil_.\r\n\r\nWhen they are adopted, Marks of Cadency now are generally placed upon\r\nthe Honour Point of the Shield, or in some other conspicuous position:\r\none of these Marks also may be charged upon another, if desired,--as a\r\nMartlet may be charged upon a Crescent to denote the fourth son of a\r\nsecond son; and so in other cases.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 365.--Seal of William Fraser:\r\n  appended to Homage Deed, A.D. 1295, preserved in H.M. Record Office.]\r\n\r\nThe Seal of WILLIAM FRASER, No. 365, from Mr. Laing's Collection,\r\nexemplifies in a singular and interesting manner the early use of a\r\ndifferenced Label. Here the Label appears, without any Shield, borne as\r\nif it were a Badge: and it is charged, on each of its three points, with\r\ntwo devices that have the appearance of mullets of six points, but which\r\nreally may be _fraises_--strawberry-leaves, the rebus-device of Fraser.\r\n(See pp. 182-185.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCING\r\n\r\n  _Differencing to denote Feudal Alliance or Dependency: Differencing\r\n  without any Alliance-- Augmentation-- Abatement._\r\n\r\n  \"Differencing, which comprises in truth the growth and ramification\r\n  of Coat-Armour, and the whole system of its early development, has\r\n  been strangely lost sight of in the numerous treatises on Armory\r\n  that have satisfied recent generations of Englishmen.\"\r\n    --HERALD AND GENEALOGIST, II. 32.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCING, using the term here as distinct from, or perhaps as not\r\nidentical with, the subject of CADENCY, includes not only the treatment\r\nof Coats of Arms and other armorial insignia, that denote and are based\r\nupon _Feudal Alliance_ or _Dependency_, but without blood-relationship;\r\nbut also implies a comprehensive system of distinguishing similar Arms,\r\nwhen they are borne by individuals or families between whom no kind of\r\nalliance is known to have existed. It is evident, on the one hand, that\r\na feudal influence would naturally lead to some degree of assimilation\r\nto the Coat-Armour of the feudal Chief, in the Arms of all allies and\r\ndependants: and, on the other hand, it will readily be understood that,\r\neven in the early days of its career, Heraldry would see the necessity\r\nfor providing for the constantly increasing demands upon its resources;\r\nand, consequently, that it would organise a system which would enable\r\nthe same Ordinaries and the same principal Charges to appear in distinct\r\nShields, without either confusion or misapprehension.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable, and indeed it may be assumed to be certain, that\r\nwhat I have called a \"feudal influence,\" in the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries in no slight degree affected the general\r\ncomposition of Coats of Arms. In very many instances the working of this\r\ninfluence is still palpable; and it is always interesting to the student\r\nof Heraldry, as it must always be eminently useful to the student of\r\nHistory, to detect its presence and to explore its method of action.\r\nLike Cadency, feudal Differencing is expressed by various means, all of\r\nthem indicating, in a greater or a less degree, the motive which\r\nsuggested their adoption. I proceed at once to examples, which\r\nillustrate and explain the system so clearly and so fully, that\r\nprolonged introductory remarks are altogether superfluous.\r\n\r\nUpon his Seal, RANULPH DE BLONDEVILLE, Earl of CHESTER (died in 1232)\r\nbears three garbs or wheat-sheaves; and Rolls of Arms of the time of\r\nHENRY III. blazon the Shield of the Earl of CHESTER as--_Az., three\r\ngarbs or_, No. 366. This Shield has been assigned to the Earls of\r\nCHESTER to this day: and, in token of feudal alliance, from the middle\r\nof the thirteenth century, \"one or more garbs,\" in the words of Mr.\r\nPLANCHÉ, \"are seen in the majority of Coats belonging to the nobility\r\nand gentry of the County Palatine of Chester.\" Thus, since the year\r\n1390, the arms of GROSVENOR have been--_Az., a garb or_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 366.--Earl of Chester.]\r\n\r\nA cinquefoil, said to have been borne by him on a red Shield, was the\r\ndevice of ROBERT FITZ-PERNEL, Earl of LEICESTER, who died in 1204.\r\nAccordingly, the cinquefoil, derived from him, as early as the\r\nthirteenth century, appears in token of feudal connection on the Shields\r\nof many families of Leicestershire. As I have already shown, (page 183)\r\na BERKELEY, who was of Leicestershire, substituted _ten cinquefoils_ for\r\nthe ten crosses patée of the Berkeley Shield; and thus he combined\r\nfeudal Differencing with Cadency.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 367.--Fitz Ralph.]\r\n\r\nMany a red chevron or chevronel, with other devices, charged upon a\r\ngolden field, or a gold chevron on a red field, is a sign of feudal\r\nalliance with the great house of DE CLARE, whose Shield was--_Or, three\r\nchevronels gu._, No. 124. For example, the FITZ-RALPHS, near neighbours\r\nof the De Clares at Clare in Suffolk, differenced the Shield of the\r\nEarls by charging _silver fleurs de lys_ on each chevronel, as in No.\r\n367 (E. 2); and, for secondary difference, they sometimes added a\r\n_bordure azure_, as in the fine early Brass at Pebmarsh, near Clare.\r\nAgain: by a change of tinctures, without affecting the charges of the\r\nShield, the Arms of L'ERCEDECKNE (now Archdeacon) are--_Arg., three\r\nchevronels sa._\r\n\r\nAt Carlaverock, EDMUND DE HASTINGS, brother of the Earl, bore--_Or,\r\na maunche gu., with a label of five points sa._, the Earl himself\r\nbearing simply--_Or, a maunche gu._, No. 276. And, close by the side of\r\nEDMOND DE HASTINGS was his friend and companion, the feudal ally,\r\nwithout doubt, of his house, JOHN PAIGNEL, a very proper comrade, as the\r\nchronicler testifies--\r\n\r\n  \"Un bacheler jolif et comté,\"\r\n\r\nwho differenced Hastings by change of tinctures, and bore--_Vert,\r\na maunche or_.\r\n\r\nThe Shield of the noble house of DE LUTERELL, or LOTEREL, I have\r\nblazoned with changed tinctures for two near kinsmen bearing that name\r\n(page 182), thus showing in what manner they marked their Cadency. This\r\nsame shield, No. 368--_Or, a bend between six martlets sa._, was also\r\ndifferenced by other families to mark their feudal alliance with the\r\nhouse of Luterell. Thus, the DE FURNIVALS, themselves a powerful and\r\ndistinguished family, who held their lands by feudal tenure under the\r\nLuterells, in token of this alliance bore the Shield of De Luterell with\r\na fresh change of tinctures; and, accordingly, the arms of the De\r\nFurnivals are well known as--_Arg., a bend between six martlets gu._\r\nThen, while the FURNIVALS, for Cadency, differenced these arms amongst\r\nthemselves, _their_ feudal allies and dependants, the ECCLESALLS or\r\nEKELESHALES, the MOUNTENEYS, the WADESLES or WADSLEYS, and the WORTELES\r\nor WORTLEYS, all united in declaring their connection with their chief\r\nby assuming arms founded upon the Furnival Coat. These very interesting\r\nand characteristic examples of feudal Differencing are well blazoned, as\r\nfollows, in the Roll of EDWARD II. For DE ECCLESALL--_Sa., a bend\r\nbetween six martlets or_: for DE MOUNTENEY--_Gu., a bend between six\r\nmartlets or_: for DE WADSLEY--_Arg., on a bend between six martlets gu.,\r\nthree escallops or_, No. 369: and for DE WORTLEY--_Arg., on a bend\r\nbetween six martlets gu., three bezants_, No. 370.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 368.--De Luterell.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 369.--De Wadsley.]\r\n\r\nThe MOUNTENEYS further difference their common arms, for Cadency, after\r\nthis manner. Instead of _gules_, Sir ERNAUF DE MOUNTENEY has the field\r\nof his shield _azure_, his bend and martlets being _golden_: Sir JOHN\r\nbears these same arms, but charges his bend with a _mullet gules_, No.\r\n371: Sir T. DE MOUNTENEY bears Sir John's arms, but with _a field\r\ngules_: and another Sir JOHN cotises his bend thus--_Gu., a bend cotised\r\nbetween six martlets or_, No. 372.\r\n\r\nNorth of the Tweed, also, the same principle is found to be exemplified\r\nin Scottish Heraldry. \"In Annandale,\" writes Mr. SETON, \"the chief and\r\nsaltire of the Bruces are carried (of different tinctures and with\r\nadditional figures) by the Jardines, Kirkpatricks, Johnstons, and other\r\nfamilies.\" The arms of BRUCE are--_Or, a saltire and a chief gu._, No.\r\n73: those of JARDINE are--_Arg., a saltire and a chief gu., the latter\r\ncharged with three mullets of the field, pierced of the second_: and the\r\narms of KIRKPATRICK are--_Arg., a saltire and chief az., the latter\r\ncharged with three cushions or_. This coat of Kirkpatrick is also borne\r\nby the JOHNSTONS, the tinctures differenced thus--_Arg., a saltire sa.,\r\nand on a chief gu. three cushions or_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 370.--De Wortley.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 371.--Sir John de Mounteney.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 372.--Sir John de Mounteney.]\r\n\r\nOnce more, returning to the southern side of the Scottish border, of\r\nRICHARD DE NEVILLE, the renowned \"King-maker,\" we find it to be recorded\r\nthat, so great was his popularity at Calais, of which city he was\r\ngovernor, that his Badges were universally adopted,--\"no man esteeming\r\nhimself gallant whose head was not adorned with his _silver ragged\r\nstaff_ (No. 294); nor was any door frequented, that had not his _white\r\ncross_ (silver saltire, No. 121) painted thereon.\" This was an\r\nextravagant application of the earlier usage in denoting feudal\r\nalliance, such as was in keeping with the heraldic sentiment of the\r\nsecond half of the fourteenth century. Those good citizens of Calais,\r\nhowever, who were Neville-worshippers four hundred years ago, were not\r\nsingular in exhibiting an armorial ensign at the entrance to their\r\nhouses. Numerous, indeed, are the doorways in various parts of England,\r\nand particularly in the counties of Surrey, Sussex, and Norfolk, which\r\nin the \"sign of the chequers\" still display the insignia (_chequée or\r\nand az._, No. 68) of the once mighty Earls of WARRENNE and SURREY; and\r\nthus show that relics of the old feudal influence are endowed with a\r\ntenacious vitality, which prolongs their existence for ages after the\r\nfeudal system itself has passed away. But no doubt some cases must be\r\nreferred to the less romantic explanation of the reckoning board of the\r\nSteward.\r\n\r\nDifferencing adopted, so far as now is apparent, _simply for the sake of\r\ndistinction_, lays open before the student of Heraldry a wide and a\r\ndiversified field of inquiry. All the miscellaneous charges that are\r\nassociated in blazon with the Ordinaries, and also with the\r\nSubordinaries, thus are brought under consideration; and, without a\r\ndoubt, it was for the express purpose of Differencing that many of these\r\ncharges were introduced into English Heraldry. How far some remote\r\ndegree of relationship, or some subordinate feudal motive now lost to\r\nsight and forgotten, may originally have affected the choice of Charges\r\n\"for difference,\" it is not possible now to determine; nor can we always\r\nfollow the rebus-loving search for a \"Difference,\" that might speak\r\nthrough that allusive quality which is a primary element of the Herald's\r\nscience. We do know that the act of bearing the same arms by different\r\nfamilies, without some heraldic Difference, was of very rare occurrence;\r\nand that, when it did occur, it was regarded with marked surprise, and\r\non more than one occasion led to a memorable controversy: and, further,\r\nwe find great numbers of early differenced Shields, which illustrate in\r\na very effective manner the growth and development of English Heraldry.\r\nShields of this order have strong claims on our attention. The examples\r\nthat I am able here to place before students are to be regarded simply\r\nas specimens, few in number, and yet sufficient to show some of the\r\nvaried forms under which early Differencing was effected.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings in the High Court of Chivalry in the suit between Sir\r\nRICHARD LE SCROPE and Sir ROBERT GROSVENOR, relative to the right to the\r\nArms--_Azure, a bend or_, No. 111--commenced on the 17th of August 1385,\r\nand the final judgment of the King himself upon the appeal of the\r\ndefendant against the finding of the Court was not pronounced till the\r\n27th of May 1390. On the 15th of May 1389 the judgment of the Court\r\nassigned the arms--_Azure, a bend or_--to Sir RICHARD LE SCROPE; and to\r\nSir ROBERT GROSVENOR, these arms--_Az., a bend or, within a plain\r\nbordure argent_. Thus the Court confirmed to Sir Richard le Scrope the\r\nright to bear the Ordinary in its severe simplicity, without any other\r\ncharge and without any Difference: and, at the same time, it was decided\r\nthat these arms of Scrope should be differenced, in order that they\r\nmight become the arms of Grosvenor, and the \"Difference\" was to be a\r\n_plain silver bordure_. The whole of the proceedings in this remarkable\r\ncase are preserved, and have been published; and they derive a peculiar\r\ninterest from the circumstance, that amongst the witnesses who gave\r\nevidence was the father of English Poetry, GEOFFREY CHAUCER. Appeal\r\nhaving been made to the Sovereign, RICHARD II. determined that a \"plain\r\nbordure argent\" was a Mark of Cadency, good and right, and perfectly\r\nsufficient as a Difference \"between Cousin and Cousin in blood\"; but\r\nthat it was \"not a sufficient Difference in Arms between two strangers\r\nin blood in one kingdom.\" The King, therefore, cancelled and annulled\r\nthe sentence of the Court of Chivalry; and in so doing he gave a very\r\nclear definition of the distinction to be observed in Heraldry between\r\nkinsmen and strangers in blood. Then it was that the Shield, _Azure,\r\na garb or_, was adopted as the arms of Grosvenor. We may assume, that\r\nthe judgment of the Court would have been confirmed by the King, had Sir\r\nRobert Grosvenor been commanded to blazon his golden bend between two\r\ngarbs, or charged with one or more garbs, or with three garbs on a\r\nchief, or with any other decided Difference which would be palpably\r\ndistinct from a Mark of Cadency.\r\n\r\nThe examples of Differenced Shields which follow I have selected from\r\nthe Roll of EDWARD II. It will be seen that in each small group of these\r\nexamples some primary feature of the composition is common to every\r\nShield, so that the distinction between the Shields in each group is\r\neffected either by a simple change of tinctures, or by the introduction\r\nof various secondary charges.\r\n\r\nCHIEFS.--Sir JOHN DE ARDERNE--_Gu., crusilée and a chief or_.

Sir J. LE\r\nSTRANGE--_Gu., two lions pass. arg._, No. 191. Sir J. DE SOMERI--_Or,\r\ntwo lions pass. az._ Sir R. DE ST. WALY--_Or, two lions pass. gu._ Sir\r\nN.

DE CANVYLE--_Az., three lions\r\npass arg._ In the beautiful chantry of Abbot THOMAS RAMRYGE, at St.\r\nAlbans, one of the large sculptured Shields is charged with a lion\r\nrampant within what may be considered to be an _orle of roses_--the\r\narms, as I have just shown, assigned in the Roll of EDWARD II. to Sir R.\r\nPIERPOUND. This Shield, carefully drawn by the engraver himself from the\r\noriginal in the Abbey Church of St. Alban, is represented in No. 373.\r\n\r\nAUGMENTATION, or AUGMENTATION OF HONOUR, is a term employed to denote an\r\naddition to a Shield of arms, specially granted by the Sovereign to\r\ncommemorate some worthy or illustrious deed, and forming an integral\r\nelement of the Shield as an hereditary bearing. Such additions will be\r\nfound marshalled in the forms of Chiefs and Inescutcheons as Cantons, or\r\nas Quarterings; or they may assume the character of additional charges.\r\nAlso, this same term denotes similar additions of Crests, Badges, or any\r\nother accessories of Shields.\r\n\r\nThe Augmentation displayed upon the Ducal Shield of WELLINGTON, a most\r\nhonourable exception to the prevailing degenerate heraldic feeling of\r\nthe period in which it was granted to the Great Duke, in characteristic\r\nand expressive qualities is second to no other example of its own class\r\nand order. This true Augmentation of Honour is the _National Device of\r\nthe British Empire_, as it is blazoned in the \"Union Jack,\" charged upon\r\nan inescutcheon, and displayed upon the honour point of the Duke's\r\npaternal Shield.\r\n\r\nAn equally significant Augmentation of an earlier date is borne in the\r\nArms of HOWARD. These Arms before the battle of Flodden were--_Gu.,\r\na bend between six crosses crosslets fitchée arg._ To commemorate the\r\ngreat victory won by him at Flodden Field, Sept. 9, 1513, when JAMES IV.\r\nof Scotland was defeated and slain, HENRY VIII. granted to THOMAS\r\nHOWARD, Duke of Norfolk, and to his descendants, as an Augmentation of\r\nHonour, the _Royal Shield of Scotland_ (No. 138), _but having a\r\ndemi-lion only, which is pierced through the mouth with an arrow_, to be\r\nborne in the middle of the bend of his proper arms. This Shield is\r\nrepresented in No. 374; and in No. 374A the augmentation is shown on a\r\nlarger scale.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 374.--Howard, after Flodden.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 374A.--The Howard Augmentation.]\r\n\r\nA small group of additional examples will be sufficient to illustrate\r\nthis most interesting class of historical Arms, and at the same time\r\nwill not fail to excite in students a desire very considerably to extend\r\nthe series through their own inquiries and researches. In memory of the\r\ndevoted courage and all-important services of JANE LANE, after the\r\ndisastrous battle of Worcester, CHARLES II. granted as an Augmentation a\r\n_Canton of England_ (No. 187 marshalled on a canton), to be added to the\r\nhereditary Coat of Lane, which is--_Per fesse or and az., a chevron gu.\r\nbetween three mullets counterchanged_. The Crest of the family of DE LA\r\nBERE is said to have been conferred by the BLACK PRINCE upon SIR RICHARD\r\nDE LA BERE, as a memorial of the good service rendered by that gallant\r\nknight on the memorable field of Cressi. This Crest is--_Out of a\r\ncrest-coronet a plume of five ostrich feathers per pale arg. and az._,\r\nthe Plantagenet colours--the device (as Mr. LOWER observes) being\r\nevidently derived from the Prince's own Badge, and also forming a\r\nvariety of the \"panache,\" the Crest then held in such high estimation.\r\nThe heart charged upon the shield of DOUGLAS (see Nos. 156, 157, p. 74)\r\nis another remarkable Augmentation. So also is the adoption of the\r\narmorial insignia of the CONFESSOR, No. 2, by RICHARD II., and his\r\nmarshalling it upon his own Royal Shield, impaled to the dexter with the\r\nquartered arms of France and England.\r\n\r\nEnglish Heraldry has been required to recognise another and a perfectly\r\ndistinct class of \"Augmentations,\" which consist of additions to the\r\nblazonry of a Shield or of additional quarterings or accessories,\r\ngranted as tokens of Royal favour, for heraldic display, but without any\r\nparticular \"merit\" in the receiver, or any special historical\r\nsignificance in themselves. Augmentations of this order may be\r\nconsidered to have been first introduced by RICHARD II., when he\r\ngranted, \"out of his mere grace,\" to his favourite ROBERT DE VERE, Earl\r\nof OXFORD, Marquess of DUBLIN and Duke of IRELAND, a differenced Coat of\r\nST. EDMUND (No. 3)--_Az., three crowns or, within a bordure argent_, to\r\nbe quartered with the DE VERE arms as the arms of IRELAND. In the same\r\nspirit, RICHARD II. granted, as similar Augmentations, the arms of the\r\nCONFESSOR to be marshalled, with Differences, on their Shields by THOMAS\r\nand JOHN HOLLAND, Dukes of SURREY and EXETER, and by THOMAS MOWBRAY,\r\nDuke of NORFOLK. It will be remembered that it was one of the capital\r\ncharges against the then Earl of SURREY, a lineal descendant of this\r\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY, the Duke of NORFOLK, in 1546, that he had assumed,\r\nwithout the special licence of HENRY VIII., the same arms of the\r\nCONFESSOR as an augmentation.\r\n\r\nBy EDWARD IV. similar augmentations, \"by grace\" and not \"for merit,\"\r\nwere granted; and by HENRY VIII. the system was carried to excess in the\r\ngrants made to augment the armorial blazonry of ANNE BOLEYN, and of his\r\nEnglish consorts, her successors.\r\n\r\nABATEMENT is a term which was unknown until it made its appearance in\r\ncertain heraldic writings of the sixteenth century, when it was used to\r\ndenote such marks or devices as, by the writers in question, were held\r\nto be the reverse of honourable Augmentation--_Augmentations of\r\ndishonour_ indeed, and tokens of degradation. True Heraldry refuses to\r\nrecognise all such pretended abatements, for the simple reason that they\r\nnever did exist, and if they could exist at all, they would be in direct\r\nantagonism to its nature, its principles, and its entire course of\r\naction. Honourable itself, Heraldry can give expression only to what\r\nconveys honour, and it records and commemorates only what is to be\r\nhonoured and held in esteem.\r\n\r\nThe very idea of an heraldic Abatement implies, if not a complete\r\nignorance, certainly a thorough misconception of the character and the\r\noffice of Heraldry. Even if Heraldry were to attempt to stigmatise what\r\nis, and what ought to be esteemed, dishonourable, who would voluntarily\r\naccept insignia of disgrace, and charge and display them upon his\r\nShield, and transmit them to his descendants? And the believers in\r\nAbatement must hold that Heraldry can exert a compulsory legislative\r\npower, which might command a man to blazon his own disgrace, and force\r\nhim to exhibit and to retain, and also to bequeath, any such blazonry.\r\nA belief in heraldic Abatement, however, is by no means singular or\r\nrare. A curious example of its existence was recently brought under my\r\nnotice, in connection with one of the most renowned of the historical\r\ndevices of English Heraldry. The _bear_, the badge of the BEAUCHAMPS,\r\nEarls of WARWICK, which appears at the feet of the effigy of Earl\r\nRICHARD in the Beauchamp chapel at Warwick, in accordance with a special\r\nprovision to that effect, is \"_muzzled_\"; and, wearing a muzzle has this\r\nbear been borne, as their Badge, by the successors of the BEAUCHAMPS in\r\nthe Warwick Earldom, the Earls of the houses of NEVILLE, DUDLEY, RICH,\r\nand GREVILLE. But, it would seem that a legend has found credence at\r\nWarwick Castle itself, which would associate the muzzle of the bear with\r\nsome dishonourable action of an Earl of the olden time; and,\r\nconsequently, it was proposed that at length this Abatement should be\r\nremoved from the bears still at Warwick! Earl RICHARD DE BEAUCHAMP was\r\nnot exactly the man to have displayed upon _his_ bear any ensign of\r\ndishonour; nor were his son-in-law, the \"King-maker,\" and Queen\r\nELIZABETH'S ROBERT DUDLEY, at all more probable subjects for any similar\r\ndisplay; still, it is quite certain that they bore the muzzled bear, as\r\nhe appears on the seal of the great Earl, No. 448.[7] That muzzle,\r\ndoubtless, has its becoming heraldic significance, without in the\r\nslightest degree partaking in the assumed character of an Abatement.\r\nI hope eventually to be able to trace out conclusively what the muzzle\r\nmay really imply, and I commend the research to other inquirers:\r\nmeanwhile, neither at Warwick nor elsewhere is there any such thing as\r\n\"Abatement\" in English Heraldry.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: See Frontispiece.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nCRESTS\r\n\r\n  \"On high their glittering crests they toss.\" --LORD OF THE ISLES.\r\n\r\n            \"Then he bound\r\n  Her token on his helmet.\" --ELAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of a CREST, of some accessory specially designed to form its\r\ncrowning adornment, appears inseparable from the existence and use of a\r\nHelm. The Warriors and Warrior Divinities of classic antiquity are\r\nrepresented to us, wearing head-pieces richly crested: and, in the\r\nMiddle Ages, had no other Heraldry ever been devised, assuredly\r\nornaments of some kind would have been placed on helms and basinets, and\r\nthese insignia would have been held in high esteem and honour.\r\nAccordingly, about the time that Coat-Armour became hereditary, having\r\nbeen reduced to a system and accepted as an independent science,\r\nheraldic Crests began to be worn as honourable distinctions of the most\r\nexalted dignity by the mediæval chivalry.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 375.--Richard I.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 376.--Henry de Perci.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 377.--Henry de Laci.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 378.--Seal of Alexander de Balliol, A.D. 1292.]\r\n\r\nUpon the Second Great Seal of RICHARD I. the cylindrical helm of the\r\nKing appears surmounted by a kind of cap or fan charged with a lion\r\npassant, the whole being arched over by a radiated ornament somewhat\r\nresembling a displayed fan, as in No. 375. Similar Crests, somewhat\r\nmodified in their details, are represented in other seals of the same\r\nera, and with them the flowing Contoise or Scarf is sometimes\r\nassociated, as in No. 376, from the seal of Baron HENRY DE PERCI, A.D.\r\n1300. Similar ornaments were also placed by the knights of those ages\r\nupon the heads of their chargers. The seal of HENRY DE LACI, Earl of\r\nLINCOLN, A.D. 1272, shows the Fan-Crest both upon the helm of the Earl,\r\nNo. 377, and the head of his war-horse. Another equally characteristic\r\nexample is the Seal of ALEXANDER DE BALLIOL, No. 378, appended to the\r\n\"General Release\" given by JOHN BALLIOL to EDWARD I., 2nd January, 1292:\r\nit will be observed that this knight displays the arms of his house, No.\r\n134, upon his Shield, and also, in addition to the Fan-Crest, upon the\r\nbarding of his charger. Again I am indebted to the kindness and\r\nliberality of Mr. Laing for the use of his admirable woodcut of this\r\nfine and interesting seal.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 379.--Helm of Thomas, second Earl of Lancaster.]\r\n\r\nThe flowing Contoise continued to be attached to helms till about the\r\nmiddle of the fourteenth century; unless, indeed, some veritable \"lady's\r\nfavour\" were worn in its stead by knights favoured as was Sir LAUNCELOT,\r\nwho, on a memorable day,--\r\n\r\n  \"Wore, against his wont, upon his helm\r\n  A sleeve of scarlet, broidered with great pearls,\r\n  Some gentle maiden's gift.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 380.--Helm and Crest of Sir Geoffrey Luterell:\r\n  A.D. 1345.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 381.--Seal of Sir Robert de Marny, A.D. 1366.]\r\n\r\nThe seal of THOMAS, second Earl of LANCASTER, about A.D. 1320, gives an\r\nexcellent example both of such figures as were beginning at that early\r\ntime to supersede the Fan-Crests, and also of the Contoise; No. 379.\r\nAbout this same period the fashion was introduced of fixing two tall\r\nspikes, one on each side of the Crest, upon the helm, probably intended\r\nin the first instance to display the contoise. These singular spikes may\r\nhave been derived by the English Heralds from their brethren of Germany,\r\nwho delighted, as they still delight, in placing upon helms as Crests,\r\nor as the accessories of Crests, small banners displayed from staves set\r\nerect and surmounted by spear-heads. In German Heraldry also Crests are\r\nvery frequently placed between tall upright horns or trumpets: and,\r\nsometimes, upon a German helm the Crest stands between horns shaped like\r\ntwo elephant's trunks (for which they have often been mistaken by\r\nEnglish Heralds), placed in the same erect position, and, like the\r\ntrumpets, so adjusted as to have the general aspect of the curved\r\noutline of a classic lyre. The helm of Sir GEOFFREY LUTERELL, A.D. 1345,\r\nNo. 380, drawn from a celebrated illumination, between the tall spikes\r\nhas a late example of the Fan-Crest; and it exemplifies the practice\r\nsometimes adopted of charging armorial insignia upon Crests of this fan\r\nform. The Arms of Luterell--_Or, a bend and six martlets sa._--were\r\nborne by Sir GEOFFREY thus differenced (E. 2)--_Az., a bend and six\r\nmartlets arg._ A pair of lofty upright wings were held in much esteem in\r\nthe Heraldry of both England and Scotland, to form the accessories of\r\nCrests. The Seal of Sir ROBERT DE MARNY, A.D. 1366, No. 381, shows his\r\narmorial shield--_Gu., a lion rampant arg._, suspended from a tree,\r\nbetween two crested helms, the crest in both cases being a _winged\r\nchapeau_, having the wings very tall and very slender.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times, Crests have occasionally been identical with\r\nthe principal charge in the Shield of Arms, or they have repeated the\r\nprincipal charge with some slight modification of attitude or accessory:\r\nbut, more generally, Crests have been altogether distinct. The Dragon\r\nand the Wyvern, the latter well exemplified in No. 315, are amongst the\r\nearliest figures that were borne as Crests in England. Other early\r\nFigure-Crests are the Lion, crowned and assumed for the first time by an\r\nEnglish Sovereign by EDWARD III.; and the Eagle, borne by the same\r\nPrince. Various devices and figures are found gradually to have been\r\nadded to these earliest Crests. The graceful and peculiarly appropriate\r\n_Panache_ soon joined them, with the heads of various animals and other\r\ncreatures: and, as the fourteenth century advances, the _Crest-Coronet_,\r\nNo. 232, the _Crest-Wreath_, No. 233, and the _Chapeau_, No. 224, assume\r\ntheir places in connection with Crests; and the _Mantling_ falls in rich\r\nfolds from them, covering the back of the Helm. In the succeeding\r\ncentury, with Helms less dignified in form, but more elaborately\r\nenriched, and with strangely fantastic Mantlings, Crests become\r\nconsiderably larger in their proportions; and they often are extravagant\r\nin their character, devices constantly being assumed and borne as\r\nCrests, which are no less inconsistent with true heraldic feeling, than\r\nwith the peculiar conditions and the proper qualities of true heraldic\r\nCrests. The Crest of the Duke of HAMILTON, No. 301, is far from being\r\none of the most inconsistent devices that were intended to be worn upon\r\nhelms. And, as it is scarcely necessary for me to add, every really\r\nconsistent Crest should be such a figure or device as might be actually\r\nworn upon his helm, by a mediæval knight, with dignity and with a happy\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 382.--Seal of William de Wyndesor.]\r\n\r\nEarly examples of Panache-Crests exist in considerable numbers, and they\r\nshow much variety of treatment. No. 285, already given at page 142,\r\nshows a Panache of several heights of feathers, the general outline\r\nhaving an oval contour. In No. 283, from the Seal of EDWARD DE\r\nCOURTENAY, Earl of DEVON, A.D. 1372, there are three heights of\r\nfeathers, and the outline has a square form. Again, the Seal of WILLIAM\r\nLE LATIMER, A.D. 1415, gives the peculiar Panache, with the no less\r\npeculiar variety of mantling, shown in No. 284. A Panache of ample\r\nproportions, and of exceedingly graceful form, is represented in the\r\nSeal of WILLIAM DE WYNDESOR, A.D. 1381. The comparatively small size of\r\nthe armorial Shield, as it generally appears when introduced into the\r\ncomposition of Seals in the fourteenth century, is shown in a striking\r\nmanner in this same example, No. 382, which in the woodcut is slightly\r\nenlarged, in order to show the device more clearly: the arms are--_Gu.,\r\na saltire or_. Other fine examples of Panache-Crests may be seen in the\r\neffigies of Sir RICHARD DE PEMBRIDGE, K.G., A.D. 1375, in Hereford\r\nCathedral; of Sir ROBERT DE MARMION, A.D. 1400, at Tanfield, Yorkshire;\r\nand of Sir THOMAS ARDERNE, about the same date, at Elford, in\r\nStaffordshire. The very fine effigy of Sir EDWARD DE THORPE, A.D. 1418,\r\nat Ashwelthorpe, in Norfolk, has a helm of rare beauty of form, with a\r\nrich mantling, and a most graceful Panache of peacock's feathers; and\r\npeacock's feathers also form the Panache of Lord FERRERS of CHARTLEY, in\r\nhis Brass, A.D. 1425, at Merevale, in Warwickshire. And, once more, upon\r\nthe Seal of THOMAS DE HATFIELD, Bishop of Durham, A.D. 1345, the Panache\r\nrises from the episcopal mitre, after the same manner as it does in No.\r\n383 from a Coronet.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 383.--Crest of Sir Richard Grey, K.G., A.D. 1420.]\r\n\r\nAnother episcopal Seal, that of Bishop HENRY LE DESPENCER, No. 351,\r\nshows a Shield of small size when compared with the helm and crest, the\r\nlatter being the favourite device of a gryphon's head between two tall\r\nupright wings. The Seals of the FITZALANS, Earls of Arundel, and the\r\nSeal of JOHN TIPTOFT, Earl of Worcester, may be specified as displaying\r\nfine examples of the same Crest. With them may be grouped the Crest of\r\nSir RICHARD GREY, K.G., Lord Grey of Codnor, A.D. 1420--_A peacock's\r\nhead and neck, between two wings erect, the feathers az., and their\r\npens_ (quills) _arg._, No. 383, from the Garter-plate at Windsor. This\r\nCrest rises from such a Crest-Coronet as was borne on their helms by\r\nnoblemen in the time of HENRY V.\r\n\r\nThe use of the _Chapeau_, or Cap of Estate, instead of a Crest-Coronet,\r\nto support a Crest upon a helm, I have already illustrated with Nos. 198\r\nand 199, severally the Lion-Crests of the BLACK PRINCE and of his son\r\nRICHARD II. Like No. 199, No. 384 is from one of the unrivalled series\r\nof helms sculptured in Westminster Hall, with the Crest and\r\nOstrich-feather Badge of King RICHARD II. In both of these examples the\r\nadjustment of the _Mantling_ is shown. Two famous Lion-Crests are those\r\nborne by the great families of HOWARD and PERCY, severally Dukes of\r\nNorfolk and Northumberland. The HOWARD lion, originally granted by\r\nRICHARD II. to THOMAS MOWBRAY, Earl Marshal, and now borne by the Duke\r\nof NORFOLK, is _a lion statant guardant, his tail extended or, and\r\nducally gorged arg._: the PERCY lion is _statant, his tail extended or_:\r\neach lion stands upon a chapeau. The Lion-Crest of the BLACK PRINCE,\r\nbeing charged with the _silver Label_ (which he may be said to wear\r\nafter the fashion of a collar), exemplifies the prevailing practice of\r\n_differencing Crests with marks of Cadency_. Crests admit every variety\r\nof Difference: and Mantlings also are frequently differenced with small\r\ncharges, or with badges; as in the Garter-plate of Sir JOHN BEAUMONT,\r\nK.G., and in the Brass at Little Easton, Essex, to Sir HENRY BOURCHIER,\r\nK.G., Earl of ESSEX.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 384.--Helm, Crest, Mantling,\r\n  and Badge of Richard II., from Westminster Hall.]\r\n\r\nThe _Crest-Wreath_ first appears about the middle of the fourteenth\r\ncentury. The earliest example to which I can refer is represented in the\r\nBrass to Sir HUGH HASTINGS, at Elsyng, in Norfolk, A.D. 1347. In this\r\nmost remarkable engraven memorial, the finial of the principal canopy is\r\nsurmounted by a helm with mantling, wreath, and the crest of\r\nHASTINGS--_a bull's head sable_; No. 385. In the effigy of Sir R. DE\r\nPEMBRIDGE, K.G., already noticed, the date of which is 1375, the crest\r\nis united to the great helm that supports the head of the knight by a\r\nwreath formed of a band of four-leaved flowers. A little later, A.D.\r\n1384, at Southacre, in Norfolk, the Brass of Sir JOHN HARSYCK has a\r\nCrest-Wreath formed of two rolls, probably of silk, twisted as in No.\r\n386. In the second half of the next century, amongst many good examples\r\nof Crest-Wreaths I select as typical specimens those which appear in the\r\nBrasses to Sir WILLIAM VERNON, A.D. 1467, at Tong, in Shropshire, No.\r\n386; and to Sir ROBERT HARCOURT, K.G., No. 387, at Staunton Harcourt,\r\nOxfordshire.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 385.--Crested Helm of Sir Hugh Hastings;\r\n  A.D. 1347.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 386, 387, and 388.--Crest-Wreaths.]\r\n\r\nThe Crest-Wreath in the form shown in the last examples, and now almost\r\nuniversally used in representations of such Crests as are without the\r\nCrest-Coronet and the Chapeau, may fairly be considered to have been\r\nderived from the rich ornamentation, generally, as it would seem, formed\r\nof costly textile fabrics, if not executed in jewelled or enamelled\r\ngoldsmith's work, that was frequently wreathed about knightly basinets.\r\nThese wreath-like ornaments are represented in numerous effigies both\r\nsculptured and engraven; and they are shown to have been worn either\r\nflat, as in No. 388, or wrought to high relief, as in No. 389. These two\r\nexamples are severally from the effigies of a knight in Tewkesbury Abbey\r\nChurch, about A.D. 1365, and of Sir HUMPHREY STAFFORD, A.D. 1450, at\r\nBromsgrove, in Worcestershire. The enamelled effigy of Earl WILLIAM DE\r\nVALANECE, A.D. 1296, at Westminster, has a wreath of delicate\r\nworkmanship in relief, which once was set with real or imitative jewels.\r\n\r\nFor many years after their first appearance, heraldic Crests were\r\nregarded as insignia of great dignity and exalted estate; and it was not\r\ntill a considerably later period that the right to bear a Crest came to\r\nbe regarded as an adjunct of the right to bear arms. Still later, when\r\nthey were granted with Coat-Armour to corporate bodies, communities, and\r\ninstitutions, Crests altogether lost their original significance; and\r\nthey became, in their use, Badges in everything except the habit of\r\nplacing them, with their accessories of Wreath or Crest-Coronet, of\r\nChapeau and Mantling, upon representations of helms.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 389.--Basinet with Crest-Wreath,\r\n  Effigy of Sir Humphrey Stafford, A.D. 1450.]\r\n\r\nWhen they were actually worn, Crests were undoubtedly constructed of\r\nsome very light materials. It is probable that _cuir bouilli_ (boiled\r\nleather), the decorative capabilities of which were so well understood\r\nby mediæval artists, was generally employed.\r\n\r\nIt has been sometimes held that Crests are personal bearings only; and,\r\ntherefore, not hereditary, though capable of being bequeathed or granted\r\nby their possessors. This theory is not sustained by early or general\r\nusage; and, accordingly, Crests must be pronounced to be hereditary, as\r\nis Coat-Armour.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that as one person may inherit, and therefore may quarter,\r\ntwo or more Coats of Arms, so the same person might claim to bear _two\r\nor more Crests_ by a similar right of inheritance. This in early times\r\nresulted in selection because no early British precedent exists for the\r\nsimultaneous display of _two_ Crests. But it was soon recognised that as\r\nno woman could bear a Crest, she ought not to transmit one, and the idea\r\nof the inheritance of the Crest with a quartering from a female\r\nancestress ceased. At the present day, several Crests, each with its own\r\nhelm and mantling, are occasionally represented above a Shield of arms:\r\nbut, in England, by strict heraldic rule, two (or more than two) Crests\r\ncan be borne by one individual, only when he has obtained the Royal\r\nlicence to bear and use the _Surname and Arms_ of another family _in\r\naddition_ to those of his own family, or, by a special grant from the\r\nCrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nBADGES\r\n\r\n  \"Might I but know thee by thy household Badge!\"\r\n    --SHAKESPEARE, _Henry VI._, _Part 2_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BADGE, like a Coat of Arms, is an armorial ensign that is complete in\r\nitself, and possesses a definite signification of its own. In use with a\r\ndecided heraldic significance long before the adoption of systematic\r\nHeraldry, Badges have always held a conspicuous position in the\r\nestimation of Heralds. A Badge resembles any single charge in Heraldry,\r\nin being a figure or device that is assumed as the distinctive\r\ncognisance of a particular individual or family: but, unlike a charge,\r\nit may be borne by itself, without any Shield, and also without any\r\naccompanying accessory, with the exception, in some instances, of a\r\n_Motto_ (See \"Motto,\" p. 138). Badges, however, are found depicted on\r\nroundels of the livery, and upon Standards, and for decorative purposes\r\nare often depicted upon mantlings. It will be evident that a Badge may\r\nbe the very same figure or device as a Crest; but, it must be remembered\r\nthat a Badge always differs from a Crest, in usually being altogether\r\nwithout crest-wreath or coronet, in consequence of having no connection\r\nwhatever with the knightly helm. There was, however, a period in which\r\nthe Badge was much confused with the Crest, which has resulted in many\r\ndevices which are really Crests being officially recorded as Badges.\r\n\r\nAfter the establishment of a true Heraldry, Badges were generally used\r\nto commemorate remarkable exploits, or in reference either to some\r\nfamily or feudal alliance, or to indicate some territorial rights or\r\npretensions. Very many Badges are allusive, and consequently they are\r\n_Rebuses_ (see \"Rebus,\" p. 146). Some are taken from the charges of the\r\nbearer's Shield, or they have a more or less direct reference to those\r\ncharges. Some trace of Marshalling or of feudal Difference may\r\nconstantly be observed in Badges; and even where the motive for the\r\nselection of certain devices has not been discovered, it may fairly be\r\nassumed that a good heraldic motive still exists, although it has become\r\nobscured or been forgotten. It was not uncommon for the same personage\r\nor family to use more than one Badge; and, on the other hand, two or\r\nmore Badges were often borne in combination, to form a single compound\r\ndevice, as in Nos. 235 and 270. The _ragged staff_, in like manner, No.\r\n294, and the _bear_, both of them Badges of the BEAUCHAMPS, Earls of\r\nWARWICK, were sometimes united to form a single Badge, and by the\r\nsuccessors of that great family the \"bear and ragged staff\" were\r\ngenerally borne as a single device. (See No. 448, and p. 319.)\r\n\r\nTwo distinct classes of Badges were in general use in the fourteenth,\r\nfifteenth, and sixteenth centuries. Those of the first class, well known\r\nas the insignia of certain eminent personages and powerful houses, were\r\nborne by all the followers, retainers, dependants, and partisans of\r\nthose personages and houses: and they were so borne by them, and they\r\nwere used by their owners for every variety of decorative purpose,\r\nbecause they were _known and understood_; and, consequently, because the\r\npresence of these Badges would cause all persons and objects bearing\r\nthem to be readily and certainly distinguished. By means of these most\r\nuseful devices a wide and comprehensive range was given to the action\r\nand the influence of true Heraldry, without infringing in the slightest\r\ndegree upon the lofty and almost sacred exclusiveness of the Coat-Armour\r\nof a noble or a gentle house. In the words which SHAKESPEARE teaches\r\nCLIFFORD to address to WARWICK, \"Might I but know thee by thy household\r\nBadge!\" it is implied that all the followers of Warwick were well known\r\nby his \"household Badge,\" which was displayed by them all, while some\r\nother insignia were worn by the great Earl upon his own person.\r\n\r\nMr. Lower has remarked (\"Curiosities of Heraldry,\" p. 145) that\r\n\"something analogous to the fashion\" of embroidering the household\r\nBadges of their lords \"upon the sleeves or breasts\" of the dependants of\r\ngreat families in the olden times, \"is retained in the Crest which\r\nadorns the buttons of our domestic servants.\" The accomplished writer\r\nmight have added that, in thus employing _Crests_ to discharge\r\n_Badge_-duties, we are content to indulge a love for heraldic display\r\nwithout observing becoming heraldic distinctions. Crested livery buttons\r\nare heraldic anomalies under all circumstances--even the head of a house\r\nhimself, if he were a Herald, would not display his Crest, as a Crest,\r\nupon buttons to be used exclusively by himself. Crests are to be borne\r\non helms, or represented as being borne on helms: Badges are decorative\r\ninsignia, and fulfil with consistent significance their own distinct and\r\nappropriate functions.\r\n\r\nBadges of the second class were devices that were borne exclusively by\r\nthe exalted personages who were pleased to assume them, often for\r\ntemporary use only, and generally with some subtle or latent\r\nsignificance, which had been studiously rendered difficult to be\r\ndetected, and dubious in its application.\r\n\r\nThese Badges, thus displayed rather to effect disguise or to excite\r\ncuriosity than to secure recognition, must be regarded for the most part\r\nas the expressions of heraldic revelry--as the fantasies and\r\neccentricities of an age, which loved to combine quaint conceits and\r\nsymbolical allusions with the display of gorgeous magnificence.\r\nAccordingly, Badges of this order are found generally to have been\r\nassumed on the occasion of the jousts or Hastiludes, the masques, and\r\nother pageants that in feudal times were celebrated with so much of\r\nelaborate and brilliant splendour.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of Badges of this peculiar character is exactly in keeping\r\nwith the sentiment which prompted men of exalted rank and eminent\r\ndistinction to appear in public, on occasions of high festivity, bearing\r\nthe arms of some friend, kinsman, or ally, instead of their own. A mark\r\nof especial favour and of peculiar distinction would be conferred, when\r\na Sovereign or a Prince thus would display upon his own person the\r\narmory of some honoured subject or comrade. EDWARD III. delighted thus\r\nto honour the most distinguished cavaliers of his chivalrous Court. For\r\nexample, in or about the year 1347, royal Hastiludes were celebrated at\r\nLichfield with great splendour, the jousters consisting of the KING and\r\nseventeen Knights, and the Earl of LANCASTER and thirteen Knights.\r\nA conspicuous part was taken in these festivities by the King's daughter\r\nISABELLE, afterwards Countess of BEDFORD, and by six Ladies of high\r\nrank, with twenty-one other Ladies, who all wore blue dresses and white\r\nhoods of the same materials as well as the same colours as the robes of\r\nthe Knights, together with various masks or vizors. On this occasion,\r\nthe KING himself over his armour wore a surcoat with the Arms of Sir\r\nTHOMAS DE BRADESTONE. These Arms in a Roll of EDWARD III. are blazoned\r\nas--_Arg., on a canton gu. a rose or_ (see _Archæologia_, xxxi., pp. 40\r\nand 118). On another occasion, during Hastiludes at Canterbury,\r\nEDWARD III. \"is said to have given eight harnesses, worked with the arms\r\nof Sir STEPHEN DE COSYNTON (_az., three roses arg._), to the PRINCE OF\r\nWALES, the Earl of LANCASTER, and six other Knights.\" In the same\r\nspirit, RICHARD DE BEAUCHAMP, Earl of WARWICK, at a great festival of\r\narms held at Calais under his presidency, on the first day entered the\r\nlists decorated with the arms of his ancestor the Lord TONEY: on the\r\nsecond day, he wore the arms of Hanslap: and, on the third day, \"he\r\nappeared as the Earl of WARWICK, quartering Beauchamp, Guy, Hanslap, and\r\nToney, on his trappings; his vizor open, and the chaplet on his helm\r\nenriched with pearls and precious stones.\" In such times, Badges of\r\ncurious device and occult signification could not fail to enjoy a\r\npopularity, not the less decided because of the restricted use and\r\nexclusive character of the Badges themselves.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 390.--Secretum of Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick;\r\n  A.D. 1296.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 391.--Seal of Sir Walter de Hungerford, K.G.;\r\n  A.D. 1425.]\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES OF BADGES, such as are distinctive, and consequently of the\r\nclass that I have first described. The Badges of PERCY are a _silver\r\ncrescent_ and a _double manacle_: of HOWARD, a _white lion_: PELHAM, _a\r\nbuckle_: DOUGLAS, a _red heart_: SCROPE, a _Cornish chough_: CLINTON,\r\na _golden mullet_: TALBOT, a _hound_: BOHUN, a _white swan_: HUNGERFORD,\r\na _sickle_: PEVEREL, a _garb_: STOURTON, a _golden \"drag\" or sledge_.\r\nThe various \"Knots,\" described and illustrated in Chapter X., Nos. 219,\r\n235, 263, 270, 274, 304, and 313, are Badges. The _bear and ragged\r\nstaff_ of the BEAUCHAMPS, and, after them, of the NEVILLES and DUDLEYS,\r\nI have already noticed. Seals frequently have Badges introduced upon\r\nthem, in very early times, by themselves, the Badge in each case\r\nconstituting the device of the Seal (see p. 193). The Secretum or\r\nprivate Seal of ROBERT BRUCE, Earl of CARRICK, the father of the King,\r\nappended to the homage-deed extorted by EDWARD I. from the Scottish\r\nnobles, is a good example, No. 390: this is another of Mr. Laing's\r\nbeautiful woodcuts. Badges also constantly appear upon Seals in\r\nassociation with Shields of arms. Thus, a Seal of one of the BERKELEYS,\r\nA.D. 1430, has a mermaid on each side of an armorial shield. Two other\r\nexamples of this kind I have already given: No. 318, the Seal of JOAN DE\r\nBARRE, which is charged with the _castle_ and _lion_ of Castile and\r\nLeon, as Badges: and No. 321, the Seal of OLIVER DE BOHUN, charged,\r\nabout the Shield, with the Bohun _Swan_. On his Seal, No. 391, Sir\r\nWALTER DE HUNGERFORD, K.G., Lord of HEYTESBURY and HOMET (the latter a\r\nNorman barony), displays his own Badge, the _sickle_, in happy alliance\r\nwith the _garb_ of Peverel (borne by him in right of his wife,\r\nCATHERINE, daughter and co-heir of THOMAS PEVEREL), to form his Crest.\r\nThe Crest, it will be observed, in No. 391, is _a garb between two\r\nsickles_. The Shield of Hungerford only--_sa. two bars arg., and in\r\nchief three plates_, is also placed between _two sickles_. Two banners,\r\ndenoting important alliances, complete the Heraldry of this remarkable\r\ncomposition: the banner to the dexter, for Heytesbury, bears--_per pale\r\nindented gu. and vert., a chevron or_; and that to the sinister, for\r\nHussy--_barry of six erm. and gu._ Lord HUNGERFORD died in 1449, and was\r\nsucceeded by his eldest surviving son, Sir ROBERT DE HUNGERFORD. The\r\nSeal of this Sir Robert, used by him during the lifetime of his father,\r\nprecisely the same in its heraldic composition as his father's Seal, is\r\nremarkable from having _each of its four sickles differenced with an\r\nermine-spot upon the blade_, to mark Cadency; and also, with the same\r\nmotive, it shows that a label of three points was charged upon the\r\nShield, and upon each of the two banners; No. 392.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 392.--Seal of Sir Robert de Hungerford:\r\n  before A.D. 1449.]\r\n\r\nThrough an alliance with the Hungerfords, _sickles_ were borne, as one\r\nof their Badges, by the great family of COURTENAY. They appear, with a\r\n_dolphin_, a _tau cross_, and this same _tau-cross_ having _a bell_\r\nattached to it, as in No. 393, sculptured on the fine heraldic\r\nchimney-piece, the work of Bishop PETER DE COURTENAY (died in 1492), now\r\nin the hall of the Episcopal Palace at Exeter.\r\n\r\nThe BADGES of our early Heraldry are comparatively but little\r\nunderstood. They invite the particular attention of students, both from\r\ntheir own special interest, and the light they are qualified to throw\r\nupon the personal history of the English people, and also from their\r\npeculiar applicability for use by ourselves at the present day. Indeed,\r\nat this time, when the revival of true Heraldry is in the act of being\r\naccomplished with complete success, it appears to be peculiarly\r\ndesirable that Badges should be brought into general use. It is not\r\nenough for us to revive our old English Heraldry as once in the olden\r\ntime it flourished in England, and to rest content with such a revival:\r\nbut we must go on to adapt our revived Heraldry, in its own spirit and\r\nin full sympathy with its genuine feeling, to conditions of our age and\r\nof the state of things now in existence. And very much may be done to\r\neffect this by the adoption of Badges, as our favourite and most\r\nexpressive heraldic insignia, both in connection with Coat-Armour and\r\nfor independent display. Unlike Crests, which must necessarily be\r\nassociated with helms and the wearers of helms, and consequently have\r\nboth a military and a mediæval character, Badges are equally appropriate\r\nfor use by Ladies, as well as by men of every profession, and they\r\nbelong alike to every age and period. This has been recognised\r\nofficially, to the extent that the officers of arms have now reverted to\r\nthe ancient practice of granting and confirming badges and Standards.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 393.--A Courtenay Badge, at Exeter.]\r\n\r\nROYAL BADGES.--I conclude this chapter with a concise list of the more\r\nimportant of the Badges that have been borne by the Sovereigns and\r\nPrinces of England; and with some general remarks upon the famous Badge\r\nof the _Ostrich Feathers_, now considered to be exclusively the Ensign\r\nof the PRINCES OF WALES, not as such, but as the heirs-apparent to the\r\nThrone.\r\n\r\nThe _Planta-genista_, or Broom-plant, No. 21, is well known as an\r\nEnglish Royal Badge, from the surname derived from it for one of the\r\nmost remarkable of the Royal Houses that ever have flourished in Europe.\r\n\r\nAs well known are the _Rose_, _Thistle_, and _Shamrock_, severally the\r\nBadges of the three realms of the United Kingdom of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND,\r\nand IRELAND. A _golden Rose stalked proper_ was a badge of EDWARD I.:\r\nand from it apparently were derived, but by what process it is unknown,\r\nthe _White Rose_ of YORK, the _Red Rose_ of LANCASTER, and the _White\r\nand Red Rose_ of the House of TUDOR.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM RUFUS: _A Flower of five foils._\r\n\r\nHENRY I.: _A Flower of eight foils._\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: _A Flower of seven foils: a Sagittarius._\r\n\r\nHENRY II.: _The Planta-genista: an Escarbuncle: a Sword and\r\nOlive-Branch._\r\n\r\nRICHARD I.: _A Star of thirteen rays and a Crescent: a Star issuing from\r\na Crescent: a Mailed Arm grasping a broken Lance, with the\r\nMotto--\"Christo Duce.\"_\r\n\r\nJOHN and HENRY III.: _A Star issuing from a Crescent._\r\n\r\nEDWARD I.: _An heraldic Rose or, stalked ppr._\r\n\r\nEDWARD II.: _A Castle of Castile._\r\n\r\nEDWARD III.: _A Fleur de lys: a Sword: a Falcon: a Gryphon: the Stock of\r\na Tree: Rays issuing from a Cloud._\r\n\r\nRICHARD II.: _A White Hart lodged: the Stock of a Tree: A White Falcon:\r\nthe Sun in splendour: the Sun clouded._\r\n\r\nHENRY IV.: _The Cypher SS: a crowned Eagle: an Eagle displayed: a White\r\nSwan: A Red Rose: a Columbine Flower: A Fox's Tail: a crowned Panther:\r\nthe Stock of a Tree: a Crescent._ His QUEEN, JOAN OF NAVARRE: _An\r\nErmine_, or _Gennet_.\r\n\r\nHENRY V.: _A Fire-beacon: a White Swan gorged and chained: a chained\r\nAntelope._\r\n\r\nHENRY VI.: _Two Ostrich Feathers in Saltire: a chained Antelope:\r\na Panther._\r\n\r\nEDWARD IV.: _A White Rose en Soleil: a White Wolf and White Lion:\r\na White Hart: a Black Dragon and Black Bull: a Falcon and Fetter-lock:\r\nthe Sun in splendour._\r\n\r\nHENRY VII.: _A Rose of York and Lancaster, a Portcullis and a Fleur de\r\nlys, all of them crowned: a Red Dragon: a White Greyhound: a Hawthorn\r\nBush and Crown, with the cypher_ H.R.\r\n\r\nHENRY VIII.: The same, without the Hawthorn Bush, and with a _White\r\nCock_.

But various badges have become stereotyped and now form a\r\nconstituent part of the Royal Arms, and will be found recited later in\r\nChapter XVIII.\r\n\r\nThe _Ostrich Feather Badge_. The popular tradition, that the famous\r\nBadge of the Ostrich Feathers was won from the blind KING OF BOHEMIA at\r\nCressi by the BLACK PRINCE, and by him afterwards borne as an heraldic\r\ntrophy, is not supported by any contemporary authority. The earliest\r\nwriter by whom the tradition itself is recorded is CAMDEN (A.D. 1614),\r\nand his statement is confirmed by no known historical evidence of a date\r\nearlier than his own work. As Sir N. HARRIS NICHOLAS has shown in a most\r\nable paper in the _Archæologia_ (vol. xxxi. pp. 350-384), the first time\r\nthe Feathers are mentioned in any record is in a document, the date of\r\nwhich must have been after 1369, and which contains lists of plate\r\nbelonging to the King himself, and also to Queen PHILLIPA. It is\r\nparticularly to be observed, that all the pieces of plate specified in\r\nthis roll as the personal property of the Queen, if marked with any\r\ndevice at all, are marked with her _own initial_, or with some heraldic\r\ninsignia that have a direct reference to _herself_. One of these pieces\r\nof plate is described as \"a large dish for the alms of the Queen, of\r\nsilver gilt, and enamelled at the bottom with _a black escutcheon with\r\nOstrich Feathers_--_eym in fund vno scuch nigro cum pennis de ostrich_.\"\r\nAnd these \"Ostrich Feathers,\" thus blazoned on a sable field upon the\r\nsilver alms-dish of Queen PHILIPPA, Sir N. H. Nicholas believed to have\r\nbeen borne by the Queen as a daughter of the House of HAINAULT; and he\r\nsuggested that these same \"Ostrich Feathers\" might possibly have been\r\nassumed by the Counts of the Province of Hainault from the Comté of\r\nOstrevant, which formed the appanage of their eldest sons.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 394.--At Worcester Cathedral.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 395.--At Peterborough Cathedral.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 396.--At Peterborough Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nAt the first, either a single Feather was borne, the quill generally\r\ntransfixing an escroll, as in No. 394, from the monument of Prince\r\nARTHUR TUDOR, in Worcester Cathedral; or, two Feathers were placed side\r\nby side, as they also appear upon the same monument. In Seals, or when\r\nmarshalled with a Shield of Arms, two Feathers are seen to have been\r\nplaced after the manner of Supporters, one on each side of the\r\ncomposition: in such examples the tips of the Feathers droop severally\r\nto the dexter and sinister: in all the early examples also the Feathers\r\ndroop in the same manner, or they incline slightly towards the\r\nspectator. Three Feathers were first grouped together by ARTHUR TUDOR,\r\nPRINCE OF WALES, eldest son of HENRY VII., as in Nos. 395 and 396, from\r\nPeterborough Cathedral; or with an escroll, as in No. 397, from a\r\nmiserere in the fine and interesting church at Ludlow. The plume of\r\nthree Feathers appears to have been encircled with a coronet, for the\r\nfirst time, by Prince EDWARD, afterwards EDWARD VI., but who never was\r\nPRINCE OF WALES: No. 398, carved very boldly over the entrance gateway\r\nto the Deanery at Peterborough, is a good early example. In No. 399 I\r\ngive a representation of another early plume of three Ostrich Feathers,\r\nas they are carved, with an escroll in place of a coronet, upon the\r\nChantry of Abbot RAMRYGE in the Abbey Church at St. Albans: and again,\r\nin No. 400, from the head of a window near the east end of the choir, on\r\nthe south side, in Exeter Cathedral, the three Feathers are charged upon\r\na Shield _per pale azure and gules_, and this Shield is on a roundle.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 397.--In Ludlow Church.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 398.--The Deanery, Peterborough.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 399.--In the Abbey Church of St. Alban.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 400.--In Exeter Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nThe Ostrich Feathers were borne, as a Badge with his Shield of Arms,\r\nupon one Seal of EDWARD III. himself: they were used, as an heraldic\r\ndevice, about the year 1370, by PHILIPPA, his Queen: they appear on\r\nsome, but not on all, the Seals of the BLACK PRINCE, and they are\r\nomitted from some of his Seals after the battle of Cressi (A.D. 1346):\r\nand they were also borne, generally with some slight difference, marking\r\nCadency, in all probability by all the other sons of\r\nEDWARD III.--certainly by JOHN OF GHENT, Duke of LANCASTER, and by\r\nTHOMAS OF WOODSTOCK, Duke of GLOUCESTER. They were adopted by\r\nRICHARD II., and placed on either side of his crested Helm in the\r\nheraldic sculpture of Westminster Hall, as appears in two of these\r\nbeautiful examples, Nos. 199 and 384: by this Prince the Ostrich\r\nFeathers were placed on his first Royal Seal, and they were habitually\r\nused for decoration and heraldic display; and they also were formally\r\ngranted by him, as a mark of especial favour, to be borne as an\r\nAugmentation of the highest honour, to his cousin THOMAS MOWBRAY, Duke\r\nof NORFOLK. The Ostrich Feathers were borne, in like manner, by the\r\nsucceeding Princes, both LANCASTRIAN and YORKIST: by at least two of the\r\nBEAUFORTS: by the Princes of the House of TUDOR: and by their successors\r\nthe STUARTS. Thus, it is certain that the Ostrich Feathers were held to\r\nbe a _Royal Badge_, from the time of their first appearance in the\r\nHeraldry of England about the middle of the fourteenth century; and that\r\nin that character they were adopted and borne by the successive\r\nSovereigns, and by the Princes, sometimes also by the Princesses (as in\r\nthe instance of a Seal of MARGARET BEAUFORT, the mother of HENRY VII.),\r\nof the Royal Houses, without any other distinction than some slight mark\r\nof Cadency, and without the slightest trace of any peculiar association\r\nwith any one member of the Royal Family. From the time of the accession\r\nof the House of Stuart to the Crown of the United Kingdom, however, the\r\ncoroneted plume of three Ostrich Feathers appears to have been regarded,\r\nas it is at this present day, as the special Badge of the Heir to the\r\nThrone.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the express provision of his will, two armorial\r\nShields are displayed upon the monument of the BLACK PRINCE in\r\nCanterbury Cathedral, which Shields the Prince himself distinguishes as\r\nhis Shields \"for War\" and \"for Peace\"; the former charged with his\r\nquartered arms of France and England differenced with his silver Label,\r\nNo. 337; and the latter, _sable_, charged with _three Ostrich Feathers\r\nargent_, their quills passing through scrolls bearing the Motto, \"_Ich\r\nDiene_\" No. 401. The same motto is placed over each of the Shields that\r\nare charged with the Feathers, as in No. 401: and over each Shield\r\ncharged with the quartered arms (there are on each side of the tomb six\r\nShields, three of the Arms, and three of the Feathers, alternately) is\r\nthe other motto of the Prince, \"_Houmout_.\" In his will, the BLACK\r\nPRINCE also desired that a \"_black Pennon with Ostrich Feathers_\" should\r\nbe displayed at his Funeral; and he further appointed that his Chapel in\r\nCanterbury Cathedral should be adorned in various places with his Arms,\r\nand \"_likewise with our Badge of Ostrich Feathers--noz bages dez plumes\r\nd'ostruce_.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 401.--Shield \"for Peace\" of the Black Prince.]\r\n\r\nThe will of the BLACK PRINCE proves the Feathers to have been a Badge,\r\nand not either a Crest or the ensign of a Shield of Arms, since twice he\r\nexpressly calls them \"_our Badge_\": and it also is directly opposed to\r\nthe traditional warlike origin and military character of the Feathers,\r\nas a Badge of the BLACK PRINCE, for it particularly specifies the\r\npeaceful significance of this Badge, and distinguishes it from the\r\ninsignia that were worn and displayed by the Prince when he was equipped\r\nfor war. The Mottoes \"_Ich Diene_\" and \"_Houmout_\" are old German, and\r\nthey signify, \"I serve,\" and \"magnanimous.\" It has been suggested by Mr.\r\nPlanché, that \"Houmout\" is Flemish, and that the three words really form\r\na single Motto, signifying, \"Magnanimous, I serve,\" that is, \"I obey the\r\ndictates of magnanimity\" (_Archæologia_, xxxii. 69).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 402.--From the Seal of King Henry IV.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 403.--From the Seal of Thomas, Duke of Gloucester.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 404.--From the Garter-Plate of John Beaufort, K.G.]\r\n\r\nUpon a very remarkable Seal, used by HENRY IV. a short time before his\r\naccession, the shield with helm and crest are placed between two tall\r\nFeathers, about each of which is entwined _a Garter_ charged with his\r\nfavourite and significant Motto--the word SOVEREYGNE, as in No. 402. His\r\nfather, Prince JOHN OF GHENT, placed _a chain_ upon the quills of his\r\nFeathers, as in the very curious boss in the cloisters at Canterbury.\r\nThe uncle of HENRY IV., THOMAS, Duke of GLOUCESTER, on one of his Seals,\r\ndifferenced his two Feathers with _Garters_ (probably of the Order)\r\ndisplayed along their quills, as in No. 403. And, about A.D. 1440, JOHN\r\nBEAUFORT, K.G., Duke of SOMERSET, on his Garter-plate placed two Ostrich\r\nFeathers erect, their _quills componée argent and azure_, and fixed in\r\ngolden escrolls; No. 404. In the Harleian MS. 304, f. 12, it is stated\r\nthat the Ostrich Feather of silver, the pen thus componée argent and\r\nazure, \"is the Duke of Somerset's\": also that the \"Feather silver, with\r\nthe pen gold, is the King's: the Ostrich Feather, pen and all silver, is\r\nthe Prince's: and the Ostrich Feather gold, the pen ermine, is the Duke\r\nof Lancaster's.\"\r\n\r\nThe Shield charged with three Ostrich Feathers, No. 401, was borne by\r\nPrince JOHN OF GHENT; and it appears on the splendid Great Seal of\r\nHENRY IV., between the Shields of the Duchy of CORNWALL and the Earldom\r\nof CHESTER. HUMPHREY, Duke of GLOUCESTER, is also recorded to have borne\r\nthis same Feather Shield.\r\n\r\nIn the Vaulting of the ceiling over the steps leading to the Hall at\r\nChristchurch, Oxford, the Ostrich Plume Badge is carved within a Garter\r\nof the Order: and, again, the Badge is represented after the same\r\nmanner, environed with the Garter, in the beautiful binding of a copy of\r\nthe Bible which is reputed to have been used by CHARLES I. in his last\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\nThe Ostrich Feathers are repeatedly mentioned in early documents; and\r\nthey are shown to have been constantly used for various decorative\r\npurposes, always evidently with an heraldic motive and feeling, by the\r\nsame Royal personages who blazoned them on their Seals, and displayed\r\nthem elsewhere as their armorial insignia. A well-known example of a\r\ndiaper of White Ostrich Feathers on a field per pale argent and vert, is\r\npreserved in the stained glass now in the great north window of the\r\ntransept of Canterbury Cathedral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nSUPPORTERS\r\n\r\n                  \"Standing by the Shield\r\n  In silence.\" --IDYLLS OF THE KING.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUPPORTER is a figure, sometimes of an angel, frequently of a human\r\nbeing, but more generally of some animal, bird, or imaginary creature,\r\nso placed in connection with a Shield of Arms as to appear to be\r\nprotecting and supporting it. In English Heraldry a single Supporter is\r\nof comparatively rare occurrence, but a number of examples are to be\r\nfound in the Heraldry of Scotland. In early examples, when two\r\nSupporters appear, they are in most cases alike: but, more recently\r\n(except in the Heraldry of France), the two figures are generally quite\r\ndistinct the one from the other, the earlier usage of having the two\r\nSupporters alike being less frequent. The modern prevailing practice in\r\nEngland is happily exemplified in the well-known instance of the present\r\nRoyal Supporters, the Lion and the Unicorn.\r\n\r\nSupporters are considered to have been introduced into the Heraldry of\r\nEngland during the reign of EDWARD III.; but they may with greater\r\naccuracy be assigned to the middle of the fifteenth century, than to the\r\nsecond half of the fourteenth. As armorial insignia of a very high rank,\r\nSupporters are granted in England only by the express command of the\r\nSovereign, except to Peers and Knights Grand Cross and Knights Grand\r\nCommanders. In Scotland, where they occur more frequently than in the\r\nHeraldry of the South of the Tweed, the \"Lord Lyon\" has power to grant\r\nSupporters. Originally by the Scottish Heralds these accessories of\r\nShields were entitled \"Bearers.\"\r\n\r\nSupporters are now granted, on payment of fees, to all Peers of the\r\nRealm to descend to the holders of a specified Peerage, and to Knights\r\nof the Garter, Thistle, and St. Patrick, and to Knights Grand Cross and\r\nKnights Grand Commanders of all other orders of knighthood to be borne\r\nfor life. Most Nova Scotia Baronets and Chiefs of Scottish Clans have\r\nsupporters registered with their arms.\r\n\r\nSupporters probably owe their origin rather to several concurrent\r\ncircumstances, than to any one particular circumstance. The mere fact of\r\na Knight carrying his own armorial Shield, or his Esquire bearing it\r\nbeside him, might suggest the general idea of some _supporting_ figure\r\nin connection with a representation of that Shield. The act of carrying\r\na Banner of Arms, in like manner, might suggest a representation of a\r\n\"Supporter\" for a Shield of Arms. To early Seals, however, Heraldry is\r\nin an especial degree indebted for the development of the idea of\r\nSupporters, and for bringing it into a definite form. Again, the\r\nprevalent use of Badges in the fourteenth century, and in the fifteenth\r\nalso, would necessarily exercise a powerful influence in the same\r\ndirection; and would lead Heralds to associate with Shields of Arms\r\ncertain other figures which, while in themselves distinct and\r\nindependent, were closely allied with certain Shields of Arms. The\r\nprototypes of true Supporters, indeed, as they appear on Seals, are\r\nBadges. In fact, it is often difficult to determine whether specified\r\nfigures on the Seals of a certain period are heraldic supporters or\r\nmerely representations of Badges.\r\n\r\nAn Effigy represented upon a Seal, as in No. 405, the Seal of\r\nDEVORGUILLA CRAWFORD, about A.D. 1290, from LAING'S Volume: or in Nos.\r\n316, 317, would be even more than a suggestion of a Supporter. The same\r\nmay be said, when some figure, almost certainly a Badge, was introduced\r\ninto the composition of a Seal, holding or supporting a Shield by its\r\nguige, as in No. 203; or when a Shield, or two or more Shields, were\r\ncharged upon some figure, as in No. 204: both of these examples, indeed,\r\nmight be regarded as illustrations of the origin or first adoption of\r\nsingle Supporters.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 405.--Seal of Devorguilla Crawford, about 1290.]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of angelic figures, which might have the appearance of\r\nacting as \"Guardian Angels,\" in their care of Shields of Arms, was in\r\naccordance with the feeling of the early days of English Heraldry; and,\r\nwhile it took a part in leading the way to the systematic use of regular\r\nSupporters, it served to show the high esteem and honour in which\r\narmorial insignia were held by our ancestors of those ages. In No. 159 I\r\nhave already shown an example of a sculptured Shield thus supported by\r\nAngels, from St. Albans. In the same noble church there are other\r\nexamples of the same character in stained glass. Angel Supporters, the\r\nfigures treated in various ways, occur in very many Gothic edifices;\r\nparticularly, sculptured as corbels, bosses or pateræ, or introduced in\r\npanels, and employed for the decoration of open timber roofs, as in\r\nWestminster Hall. They appear also on Seals; as on the Seal of HENRY OF\r\nLANCASTER, about A.D. 1350, which has the figure of an Angel above the\r\nShield, and a lion on each side of it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 406.--Part of Seal of Margaret, Lady Hungerford.]\r\n\r\nThe representation of armorial Banners upon Seals would lead to at least\r\nthe occasional introduction of some figure to hold, or _support_, the\r\nBanner; and here, again, we discern the presence of some of the\r\nimmediate predecessors of \"Supporters,\" properly so called. In the\r\nSeals, Nos. 391, 392, the Banners are not supported, and yet they are\r\nindirectly suggestive of giving support to the Shield which is\r\nmarshalled with them in the same composition. Another Hungerford Seal,\r\nthat of MARGARET BOTREAUX, widow of the second Baron HUNGERFORD (who\r\ndied in 1477), in the centre of the composition has a kneeling figure of\r\nthe noble lady, and on each side a banner of arms is held (_supported_)\r\nerect, so that the two banners form a kind of canopy over her head, by a\r\nlion and a gryphon. In No. 406 I give a part only of this elaborate\r\nSeal, sufficient to show how its general composition bears upon the\r\nadoption of Supporters. The Monument in Westminster Abbey of Sir LUDOVIC\r\nROBSART, K.G., Lord BOURCHIER, Standard-Bearer to HENRY V. at Agincourt,\r\nhas two banners sculptured in the stone work of the canopy, which are\r\nplaced precisely in the same manner as the banners in No. 406; and, like\r\nthem, they are held by Badges acting as Supporters. Two well-known seals\r\nof the PERCIES are charged with banners, and in each case the\r\nbanner-staff is held by a single Supporter: one of these figures is a\r\nman-at-arms, A.D. 1386; the other is a lion, A.D. 1446. At the same\r\nperiod, two lions appear on another Percy Seal. Another, of the same\r\ndate, has the shield supported by an armed man, without any banner, but\r\nhaving a lance with a long pennon charged with the Crescent badge of\r\nPERCY, No. 412, p. 247. Other Percy Seals, again, of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, on either side of the Shield have two lions or two birds.\r\n\r\nNumerous examples of great interest illustrate the early introduction of\r\nBadges into the composition of Seals, as accessories of Shields. A Seal\r\nof Prince JOHN OF GHENT, which has two falcons and padlocks, is one of\r\nthe most beautiful and suggestive works of its class: in this Seal the\r\ntwo birds are addorsed, and consequently they also have their backs\r\nturned towards the central achievement. This position of the figures on\r\nearly Seals is not uncommon; but it is an illustration that the use of\r\nBadges in the form from which they developed into supporters was an\r\nartistic necessity, arising from the form of the spaces to be occupied\r\nby the figures upon the Seal. Another most characteristic example of\r\nthat marshalling of Badges upon Seals, which certainly led the way to\r\ntrue Supporters, is the Seal of Sir MAURICE DE BERKELEY, A.D. 1430, upon\r\nwhich _a mermaid_--the Berkeley badge--is blazoned on each side of the\r\nShield. The two figures are drawn with much skill and elegance. The\r\nShield itself quarters _Berkeley_ within a bordure, and a differenced\r\ncoat of _Bottetourt_: it hangs from a large helm, which, in its turn, is\r\nensigned by as large a _mitre_--the singular Crest of the Berkeleys. The\r\ntwo figures, generally animals, which fill up the spaces to the dexter\r\nand sinister of the central achievement on Seals, in the fifteenth\r\ncentury are almost invariably drawn of a comparatively large size; and,\r\nfor the most part, they really act as _Supporters to the Crested Helm_,\r\nbeing themselves _supported by the Shield_. The composition of the Seal\r\nof EDMUND DE MORTIMER, Earl of MARCH, A.D. 1400, though now mutilated,\r\nexhibits in a most satisfactory manner this very effective arrangement,\r\nfrom which true Supporters to a Shield of Arms might obviously be\r\nderived. In this Seal, No. 407, the Shield quarters _Mortimer_, No. 131,\r\nand--_or, a cross gu._, for _Ulster_. The Seal of WM. DE WYNDESOR, No.\r\n382, illustrates with no less happy effect the occasional use of birds\r\ninstead of beasts, as Supporting Badges. Other examples exist in great\r\nnumbers, and in abundant variety: the two that I add from Mr. Laing's\r\nVolume, Nos. 408 and 409, are in every respect most characteristic; they\r\nare severally the Seals of ROBERT GRAHAM, of Kinpont, and of Sir WILLIAM\r\nLINDSAY, of the Byres.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 407.--Seal of Earl Edmund de Mortimer; A.D. 1400.]\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary for me to point out to students that Supporters\r\nalways have a decided heraldic significance. In supporting a Shield of\r\nArms, they discharge an heraldic duty: but, in themselves, Supporters\r\nare armorial symbols of a high rank; and, with peculiar emphasis, they\r\nrecord descent, inheritance, and alliance, and they blazon illustrious\r\ndeeds.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 408.--Seal of Robert Graham, of Kinpont,\r\n  A.D. 1433.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 409.--Seal of Sir Wm. Lindsay, of the Byres,\r\n  A.D. 1390.]\r\n\r\nSupporters should always be represented in an erect position. In\r\nwhatever direction also they actually may be looking, they always ought\r\nto appear to fulfil their own proper office of giving vigilant and\r\ndeferential _support to the Shield_. It would be well, in our blazoning\r\nof supported Achievements, not only for us to regard a becoming position\r\nand attitude for Supporters to be matters determined by positive\r\nheraldic law, but also that some satisfactory arrangement should be made\r\nand recognised for general adoption, by which an equally becoming\r\n_support_ would be provided for \"Supporters.\" An unsatisfactory custom\r\nhas been either to place the Supporters, whatever they may be, upon some\r\nvery slight renaissance scroll work that is neither graceful nor\r\nconsistent, or, to constrain the Motto scroll to provide a foundation or\r\nstanding-place for them. In the latter case, an energetic lion, or a\r\nmassive elephant, and, in a certain class of achievements of\r\ncomparatively recent date, a mounted trooper, or a stalwart man-of-war's\r\nman, probably with a twenty-four pounder at his feet, are made to stand\r\non _the edge of the ribbon_ that is inscribed with the Motto. Mr. Laing\r\nhas enabled me to give an excellent example of Supporters--two lions\r\nstanding upon a motto-scroll or ribbon--in No. 410, the Seal of JOHN\r\nDRUMMOND, created Earl of MELFORT and Viscount FORTH in the year 1686:\r\nthe Shield is _Scotland, within a bordure componée_; the Supporters are\r\ngorged with collars charged with thistles; and the Crest is the Crest of\r\nScotland issuing from a celestial Crown. As says the Motto of Sir\r\nWILLIAM MAHON, \"_Moniti, meliora sequamur_\"--now that we have been told\r\nof it, let us produce something better than this support for our\r\nSupporters. Happily the best heraldic artists of the moment seem very\r\ngenerally to have reverted to the older and more preferable form.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 410.--Seal of John Drummond, Earl of Melfort,\r\n  A.D. 1686.]\r\n\r\nThe Heralds of France still restrict the term \"Supporters\"--\"_Les\r\nSupports_\"--to animals; whilst to human beings, to figures of angels,\r\nand to mythological personages or other figures in human form, when\r\nsupporting a Shield, they apply the term \"_Les Tenants_.\" When trees or\r\nother inanimate objects are placed beside any armorial shield, and so\r\ndischarge the duty of Supporters in French achievements, they are\r\ndistinguished as \"_Les Soutiens_.\" An old French writer on Heraldry,\r\nPALLIOT, however, says that in his time (A.D. 1660), _Tenant_ is used in\r\nthe singular number, and denotes any kind of _single Supporter_, while\r\n_Supports_ is used when there are _two_.\r\n\r\nIn the French Heraldry of the present time, a single Tenant or Support\r\nis of rare occurrence; and when two Tenants or Supports appear in\r\nblazon, they are generally, though not always, alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nFLAGS\r\n\r\n  _The Pennon-- The Banner-- The Standard-- The Royal Standard-- The\r\n  Union Jack-- Ensigns-- Military Standards and Colours-- Blazoning--\r\n  Hoisting and Displaying Flags._\r\n\r\n  \"Many a beautiful Pennon fixed to a lance,\r\n  And many a Banner displayed.\"\r\n    --SIEGE OF CARLAVEROCK, A.D. 1300.\r\n\r\n  \"Prosper our Colours!\"\r\n    --SHAKESPEARE, _Henry VI._, _Part 3_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmirably adapted for all purposes of heraldic display, rich in glowing\r\ncolours, and peculiarly graceful in their free movement in the wind,\r\nFLAGS are inseparably associated with spirit-stirring memories, and in\r\nall ages and with every people they enjoy an enthusiastic popularity\r\npeculiar to themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, in England, three distinct classes of heraldic Flags\r\nappear to have been in general use, each class having a distinct and\r\nwell-defined signification.\r\n\r\n1. First, the PENNON, small in size, of elongated form, and either\r\npointed or swallow-tailed at the extremity, is charged with the Badge or\r\nsome other armorial ensign of the owner, and by him displayed upon his\r\nown lance, as his personal ensign. The Pennon of Sir JOHN D'ABERNOUN,\r\nNo. 286, fringed and pointed, A.D. 1277, bears his arms--_Az., a chevron\r\nor_: and No. 411, another example of the pointed form of Pennon, is from\r\nthe Painted Chamber, Westminster, about A.D. 1275. No. 412, a long\r\nswallow-tailed Pennon, charged with the Percy crescent Badge, is from\r\nthe Seal of HENRY DE PERCI, first Earl of NORTHUMBERLAND. Before the\r\ntrue heraldic era, _Lance-Flags_ with various decorative devices, but\r\nwithout any blazonry having a definite signification, were in use: See\r\nNos. 5, 6. The _Pennoncelle_ was a modification of the Pennon.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 411.--Pennon, from the Painted Chamber.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 412.--Pennon of Percy; A.D. 1400.]\r\n\r\n2. Second, the BANNER, square or oblong in form, and of a larger size\r\nthan the Pennon, bears the entire Coat of Arms of the owner blazoned\r\nover its whole surface, precisely as the same composition is blazoned\r\nupon a Shield: No. 162. The Banner has been described as the ensign of\r\nthe Sovereign, or of a Prince, a Noble, or a Knight who had been\r\nadvanced to the higher rank or degree of a \"Banneret\"; but it would seem\r\nalmost certain that the display of Arms upon a Banner was never confined\r\nto a Banneret. Two Banners are represented in each of the Hungerford\r\nSeals, Nos. 391, 392. A small group of oblong Banners, with two pointed\r\nPennons, is represented in No. 413, from the Painted Chamber.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 413.--Oblong Banners and Pointed Pennons,\r\n  from the Painted Chamber.]\r\n\r\nIn the olden time, when a Knight had distinguished himself by\r\nconspicuous gallantry, it was the custom to mark his meritorious conduct\r\nby prompt advancement on the very field of battle. In such a case, the\r\npoint or points of the good Knight's Pennon were rent off, and thus the\r\nsmall Flag was reduced to the _square_ form of the Banner, by which\r\nthenceforth he was to be distinguished. FROISSART, in his own graphic\r\nmanner, has described the ceremonial which attended the first display of\r\nthe Banner of a newly-created Banneret on the field of battle. Sir JOHN\r\nCHANDOS, one of the Knights Founders of the Garter, appeared with his\r\nmaiden Banner on the field, on the morning of the battle of Naveret, in\r\nCastile, April 3rd, 1367:--\"He brought his banner in his hands,\" says\r\nthe chronicler, \"rolled up\" (rolled round the staff), \"and said to the\r\nPRINCE OF WALES\"--it was the BLACK PRINCE,--\"'My Lord, behold, here is\r\nmy Banner: I deliver it to you in this way,\"--still rolled round the\r\nstaff, that is--\"'that it may please you to display it, and that this\r\nday I may raise it; for, thank God, I have land and heritage sufficient\r\nto support the rank as it ought to be!' Then the Prince and the\r\nKing\"--Don PETRO, King of Castile--\"took the Banner, which was of silver\r\nwith a sharp pile gules, between their hands by the staff, and displayed\r\nit, and returned it to him, the Prince saying--'Sir John, behold your\r\nBanner; may God grant you may do your duty!' Then Sir JOHN CHANDOS bore\r\nhis Banner (displayed) to his own Company, and said--'Gentlemen, see\r\nhere my Banner and yours; preserve it as your own!'\" We see that, like\r\nanother hero of a later period, the BLACK PRINCE held the\r\nmaxim--\"England expects every man to do his duty.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 414.--Seal of Earl John Holland,\r\n  Admiral of England, &c., A.D. 1436.]\r\n\r\nQuarterings, Marks of Cadency, and Differences (but not impalements) are\r\nblazoned on Banners under the very same conditions that they appear on\r\nShields of Arms. For example, the Banners, as well as the Shield, on the\r\nseal of Sir Robert de Hungerford, No. 392, are Differenced with a label\r\nfor Cadency, and thus are distinguished from the corresponding Banners\r\nand Shield on the Seal of Sir Robert's father, No. 391.\r\n\r\nCrests, Badges, Supporters, and other external accessories and ornaments\r\nof Armorial Shields have no place on Banners, a Banner representing a\r\nShield, and being charged as a Shield. In the seventeenth century,\r\nhowever, English Banners sometimes were charged with Achievements of\r\nArms, including all the accessories and ornaments of Shields.\r\n\r\nIn early times Banners appear in use at sea, as well as on land; and the\r\nsame Banners were used both on shore and afloat. The _sails_ of our\r\nearly shipping, also, are constantly represented as covered with\r\narmorial blazonry, and they thus were enabled to act as Ship-Flags. Many\r\ncurious and interesting representations of the strange, unwieldy,\r\nunship-shape looking craft that were the ancestors of the British Navy,\r\nare introduced with their _heraldic sails_ and their Banners into the\r\ncompositions of Seals. A fine example of its order is the Seal of JOHN\r\nHOLLAND, Earl of HUNTINGDON, A.D. 1436, \"Admiral of England, Ireland,\r\nand Aquitaine,\" No. 414. The ship is really a noble-looking vessel, with\r\nher solitary sail blazoned with the Lord Admiral's Arms--_England,\r\nwithin a bordure of France_,--the same arms that were borne by Prince\r\nJOHN OF ELTHAM, No. 24. In this example the crew are not represented:\r\nbut in other Seals of early shipping figures are commonly introduced,\r\nand almost always they are drawn of ludicrously disproportionate size.\r\nThis ship does not display any Banner from a banner-staff, but has a\r\nnautical Pennon of ample size flying at the mast-head: when Banners are\r\ndisplayed on board ships upon early Seals, they are generally narrow in\r\nproportion to their height, a form of Banner adopted on land as well as\r\nat sea, in consequence of the greater inconvenience attending the\r\ndisplay of broad or really square Banners. At a later period, however,\r\nShip-Flags of very large size came into favour.\r\n\r\n3. The STANDARD, the third variety of early heraldic Flags, which first\r\nappears about the middle of the fourteenth century, and was in general\r\nuse by personages of high rank in the two following centuries, appears\r\nto have been adopted for the special purpose of displaying the Badge.\r\nThe Badge was worn on his livery by a servant as retainer, and\r\nconsequently the Standard by which he mustered in camp was of the livery\r\ncolours, and bore the Badge, with both of which the retainer was\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 415.--Standard of Sir Henry de Stafford, K.G.:\r\n  about A.D. 1475.]\r\n\r\nThis Flag is of ample proportions, and great length; but its size varies\r\nwith the owner's rank. Next to the Staff was usually to be found the\r\n_red cross on a silver field_ of ST. GEORGE. The rest of the field is\r\ngenerally divided per fesse into two tinctures, in most cases the livery\r\ncolours of the owner, or the prevailing tinctures of his Coat of Arms,\r\nwhich in such cases may almost be assumed to have been his livery. With\r\nsome principal figure or device occupying a prominent position, various\r\nBadges are displayed over the whole field, a Motto, which is placed\r\nbend-wise, having divided the Standard into compartments. The edges are\r\nfringed throughout, and the extremity is sometimes swallow-tailed, and\r\nsometimes rounded.\r\n\r\nThe Standard of Sir HENRY DE STAFFORD, K.G., second son of HENRY, second\r\nDuke of BUCKINGHAM (executed in 1483), is represented in No. 415, from a\r\ndrawing in the Heralds' College. It is charged, first, with _a cross of\r\nSt. George_: then, on a _field per fesse sable and gules_ (the colours\r\nof the Duke's livery), _the White Swan_ of the De Bohuns, with the\r\n_silver Stafford-knot_ (No. 304), differenced with _a Crescent gules_\r\nfor Cadency; the Motto is HVMBLE : ET: LOYAL; and the fringe, of the\r\nsame colours as the field, is _componée sa. and gu._ In other examples a\r\ngreater variety of Badges is introduced. The student will not fail to\r\ntake notice of the systematic display of the ensign of St. George in\r\nthese Standards, as the national armorial device of England. The use and\r\nheraldic display of these standards had practically lapsed, but the\r\nCollege of Arms has now reverted to its ancient practice of recording\r\nthem in cases of the grant or confirmation of a Badge.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 416.--The Royal Standard, or Banner.]\r\n\r\nThe ROYAL STANDARD (to give it its popular name) is not really a\r\nStandard at all, but is the King's Banner of his arms. It stands at the\r\nhead of our English Flags of the present day, and bears the full\r\nblazonry of the Royal Arms of His Majesty THE KING, as they are\r\nmarshalled on the Royal Shield: No. 416. It is personal to the King, and\r\nits use by other people is not permitted. This splendid Flag, so truly\r\nheraldic in its character, and charged with Coat-Armour and not with\r\nBadges, ought to be styled the ROYAL BANNER. The same Standard is duly\r\ndifferenced with their own Marks of Cadency and their Shields of\r\nPretence for the different members of the Royal Family. For use at sea,\r\nwhilst the PRINCE OF WALES has his own Flag or Banner of his arms, all\r\nother members of the Royal Family use a flag showing the Royal Arms\r\nwithin a bordure ermine. QUEEN MARY and QUEEN ALEXANDRA fly flags of\r\ntheir impaled arms.\r\n\r\nThe UNION JACK, which is regarded as the national British Flag, as we\r\nnow display it, is the second of its race. Strictly speaking, it is as\r\nmuch the property of the Sovereign as the Royal Banner, but objection to\r\nits use and display is not officially made. The _First Union Jack_, No.\r\n417, was produced in obedience to a Royal Proclamation of JAMES I. in\r\nthe year 1606. Its object was to provide a single National Flag for both\r\nEngland and Scotland as a single kingdom, which might put an end to\r\ncertain serious disputes concerning the precedence of their respective\r\nBanners of St. George and St. Andrew, Nos. 418, 419, between the natives\r\nof England and Scotland--of \"South and North Britain.\" This \"Union\" Flag\r\ncombined the blazonry of the two rival ensigns, not marshalling them by\r\nquartering after the early heraldic usage, but by reviving a still\r\nearlier process, and by blending the cross and the saltire of Nos. 418\r\nand 419 in a single composition. This was effected, accordingly, by\r\ncharging the Cross of St. George, with a narrow border or \"fimbriation\"\r\nof white to represent its white field, _upon_ the Banner of St. Andrew,\r\nthe result being the Flag shown in No. 417. On the final \"Union\" between\r\nEngland and Scotland in 1707, this device was formally declared to be\r\nthe \"Ensign armorial of the United Kingdom of Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 418.--St. George.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 417.--The First Union Jack.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 419.--St. Andrew.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 420.--The Second Union Jack.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 421.--St. Patrick.]\r\n\r\nUpon the first day of January, 1801, the _Second Union Jack_, the \"Union\r\nJack\" of to-day, No. 420, superseded the Flag of King JAMES and Queen\r\nANNE. The \"Union\" with Ireland rendered a change necessary in the Union\r\nJack, in order to incorporate with its blazonry the Banner of ST.\r\nPATRICK, No. 421, _arg., a saltire gu._ There seems good reason to\r\nbelieve that the so-called Cross of St. Patrick had little, if indeed\r\nany, separate or prior existence. The process that had been adopted\r\nbefore was again brought into action, but now a single compound device\r\nhad to be formed by the combination of a cross and two saltires, Nos.\r\n418, 419, and 421. As before, in this new Flag the blue field of ST.\r\nANDREW forms the field: then the two Saltires, the one white and the\r\nother red, are formed into a single compound Saltire counter-changed of\r\nthe two tinctures alternating, the white having precedence; a narrow\r\nedging of white is next added to each red side of this new figure, to\r\nrepresent the white field of St. Patrick, as the narrow edging of white\r\nabout the red cross represented the white field of ST. GEORGE in No.\r\n418; and, finally, the red cross of St. George fimbriated with white, as\r\nin the First Jack, is charged over all. Such is the Second Union Jack,\r\nNo. 420. In this compound device it will be observed that the _broad\r\ndiagonal white_ members represent the _silver saltire_ of St. Andrew,\r\nNo. 419: that the _red diagonal_ members represent the _saltire gules_\r\nof St. Patrick, No. 421, and that the _narrow diagonal white_ lines are\r\nadded in order to place this _saltire gules on a field argent_: that the\r\n_diagonal red and the broad diagonal white members_ represent the two\r\nSaltires of St. Andrew and St. Patrick in combination: and that the\r\n_fimbriated red cross_ in the front of the goodly alliance declares the\r\npresence of the symbol of St. George.\r\n\r\nSir HARRIS NICHOLAS has suggested that this flag may have acquired its\r\nname of \"Jack\" (\"Union\" is obvious enough) from the original author of\r\nthe First Union Flag, King JAMES, who, in the Heralds' French language,\r\nwould be styled _Jacques_: and so the Flag would be called \"Jacques'\r\nUnion,\" which would easily settle down into \"Jack's Union,\" and finally\r\nwould as easily become \"Union Jack.\" The Second Union Flag is always to\r\nbe hoisted as it is represented in No. 420, the diagonal white having\r\nprecedence in the first canton. To reverse the proper display of the\r\nFlag implies distress or danger; or such a procedure (very often, as I\r\nam aware, unconsciously adopted, through ignorance of the real meaning\r\nof the Flag itself) subjects the Union Jack to degradation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 422.--The Red Ensign.]\r\n\r\nBy a recent warrant Lords Lieutenant fly the Union Jack charged with a\r\nsword fesseways.\r\n\r\nThe ENSIGNS now in use are:--\r\n\r\n1. The _Red Ensign_, a plain red Flag cantoning a Union Jack--having a\r\nJack in the dexter chief angle next to the point of suspension: No. 422.\r\nThis Ensign shares with the Union Jack the honour of being the \"Ensign\r\nof England\"--the Ensign, that is, of the British Empire. When displayed\r\nat sea, it now distinguishes all vessels that do not belong to the Royal\r\nNavy: but, before the year 1864, it was the distinguishing ensign of the\r\n\"red squadron of the Navy,\" and of the \"Admirals of the Red\"--the\r\nAdmirals of the highest rank.\r\n\r\n2. The _White_ or _St. George's Ensign_ is the old banner of St. George,\r\nNo. 418, with a Jack cantoned in the first quarter. It now is the Ensign\r\nof the Royal Navy: but, before 1864, it distinguished the \"white\r\nsquadron\" of the Navy, and the Admirals--second in rank--of that\r\nSquadron.\r\n\r\n3. The _Blue Ensign_ differs from the Red only in the field being plain\r\nblue instead of red. It now is the Ensign of the Naval Reserve: before\r\n1864 it was the Ensign of \"Admirals of the Blue,\" third in rank, and of\r\ntheir Squadron of the Royal Navy.\r\n\r\nA Red Ensign is often charged with a Crown, or with some appropriate\r\ndevice, to denote some particular department of the public service.\r\n\r\nWith the Ensigns may be grouped the _Flag of the Admiralty_, which\r\ndisplays a yellow anchor and cable set fesse-wise on a red field.\r\n\r\nThe Ensigns are always to be hoisted so as to have the Jack next to the\r\npoint of suspension, as in No. 422.\r\n\r\nMILITARY FLAGS. 1. _Cavalry Standards_, being lineal descendants of the\r\nknightly Banners of mediæval chivalry, are small square Flags, the\r\ncolour of the field the same as the regimental facings; and each\r\nStandard bears the Number, Motto, and specific Title of its own\r\nRegiment, with whatever heraldic Badge or Device may be associated with\r\nit. Upon these Standards also are blazoned the regimental\r\n\"_Honours_\"--such words as WATERLOO, ALMA, LUCKNOW, and others, which\r\nbriefly and with most emphatic significance declare the services of the\r\ncorps. The Household Cavalry, the Life Guards and Blues, have all their\r\nStandards of Crimson, and they are blazoned with the Royal Insignia and\r\ntheir own \"Honours\" and Devices.\r\n\r\n2. _Infantry Colours._ In the first instance, each Regiment of Infantry\r\nhad one \"Colour\": subsequently, two others were added: and, finally, in\r\nthe reign of Queen Anne, it was decided that every Infantry Regiment or\r\nBattalion of the Line (the Rifles of the Line excepted, who have no\r\n\"Colours\") should have its own \"Pair of Colours.\" Of this \"Pair,\" one is\r\nthe \"_King's Colour_\"--a Union Jack charged with some regimental\r\nDevices: the other, the \"_Regimental Colour_\" is of the tincture of the\r\nfacings, on which the \"Honours\" and \"Devices\" of the Regiment are\r\ncharged, and in the dexter chief angle a small Jack is cantoned: in\r\nfact, the \"Regimental Colour\" is the same as the Red or Blue Ensign (No.\r\n422), the Colour of the field varying with the regimental facings, and\r\nthe field itself being charged with the various Devices.\r\n\r\nIn their Colours, the Guards reverse the arrangement that obtains with\r\nthe Regiments of the Line. With them, the _Kings Colour_ is always\r\ncrimson, with or without a Jack, but charged with the Royal Cypher and\r\nthe regimental Devices: the _Regimental Colour_ of the Guards is the\r\nUnion Jack.\r\n\r\n3. The _Royal Artillery_ have no Colours or Standards.\r\n\r\nMilitary Flags are not now used in actual warfare by British troops.\r\n\r\nI conclude this Chapter, which treats briefly of the Heraldry of the\r\nmost important English Flags, with four still more brief general\r\nremarks:--\r\n\r\n1. First: by all English people who are disposed to exclaim, making\r\nSHAKESPEARE'S words their own, \"_Prosper our Colours!_\" it ought to be\r\nunderstood that their National Flags are endowed with heraldic, that is,\r\nwith historical significance, recorded after an heraldic fashion.\r\n\r\n2. Second: this significance of their Flags ought also to be understood,\r\nthat it may be appreciated, by all true English people.\r\n\r\n3. Third: our Flags ought always to be made and represented correctly.\r\n\r\nAnd 4. Lastly: our Flags, and all other Flags also, ought always to be\r\nhoisted and displayed rightly and properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL HERALDRY OF ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND\r\n\r\n  _Shields of Arms of the Reigning Sovereigns of England; of Scotland;\r\n  of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland-- Crests--\r\n  Supporters-- Mottoes-- Crowns-- Banners-- Armorial Insignia of the\r\n  late Prince Consort; of the Prince and Princess of Wales; of the other\r\n  Princes and Princesses._\r\n\r\n  \"On his Banner were three Leopards, courant, of fine gold, set on\r\n  red: fierce were they, haughty and cruel, to signify that, like them,\r\n  the KING is dreadful to his enemies; for his bite is slight to none\r\n  who inflame his anger: and yet, towards such as seek his friendship\r\n  or submit to his power his kindness is soon rekindled.\"\r\n    --ROLL OF CARLAVEROCK.\r\n\r\n  \"With Scotland's Arms, Device and Crest\r\n  Embroidered round and round.\"\r\n    --MARMION.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow the \"three Leopards courant\" of the shrewd chronicler of Carlaverock\r\nare identical with the \"three Lions passant guardant\" of the Royal\r\nShield of England I have already shown (see page 84). To the Norman\r\nSovereigns of England, WILLIAM I., WILLIAM II., HENRY I., and STEPHEN\r\n(A.D. 1066-1154), the same Shield of Arms has been assigned--_Gu., two\r\nlions pass. guard., in pale, or_, No. 22. It must be distinctly\r\nunderstood, however, that there exists no certain authority for these\r\nArms.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, STEPHEN is also _said_ to have borne on a red Shield\r\nthree golden _Sagittaries_, or Centaurs, with bows and arrows. And,\r\nagain, HENRY II. is _considered_ to have added a third lion to the two\r\non the Shield of his father, a _single golden lion passant guardant on\r\nred_ being (also considered to be) the armorial ensign of the province\r\nof Aquitaine, acquired by HENRY in right of his Consort, ALIANORE.\r\n\r\nAs early as the reign of HENRY III., a Shield of Arms, No. 23, was\r\nassigned to the Anglo-Saxon Kings: another Shield, No. 2, was assigned\r\nto EDWARD THE CONFESSOR: and a third Shield, No. 3, to another sainted\r\nAnglo-Saxon Prince, EDMUND.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 22.--Royal Arms, supposed to have been borne\r\n  before A.D. 1189.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 187.--Royal Arms, from A.D. 1189 to 1340.]\r\n\r\nFrom the appearance of the Second Great Seal of RICHARD I., about A.D.\r\n1195, all uncertainty concerning the Royal Arms of England is at an end,\r\nand they are borne as follows by the successive English Sovereigns:--\r\n\r\nRICHARD I.: JOHN: HENRY III.: EDWARD I.: EDWARD II.: and EDWARD III.,\r\ntill the thirteenth year of his reign, A.D. 1340:--_Gu., three lions\r\npassant guardant in pale or_,--No. 187.\r\n\r\nEDWARD III., from the thirteenth year of his reign, when he claimed to\r\nbe King of France as well as of England, and so styled himself:\r\nRICHARD II.: and HENRY IV., till about the fifth year of his\r\nreign:--_France Ancient and England quarterly_,--No. 252.\r\n\r\nRICHARD II. sometimes bore the Arms of the CONFESSOR, No. 2, with his\r\nown, on a separate shield, as at Westminster Hall; and sometimes he\r\nimpaled the Confessor's Arms with his own quartered Shield, the arms of\r\nthe Confessor having the precedence.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 252.--Royal Arms from A.D. 1340 to about 1405.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 253.--Royal Arms from about A.D. 1405 to 1603.]\r\n\r\nHENRY IV. from about 1405: HENRY V.: HENRY VI.: EDWARD IV.: EDWARD V.:\r\nRICHARD III.: HENRY VII.: HENRY VIII.: EDWARD VI.: MARY: and ELIZABETH,\r\nto A.D. 1603:--_France Modern and England Quarterly_, No. 253.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Shield of SCOTLAND, No. 138, first appears upon the Seal of\r\nALEXANDER II. about A.D. 1235; and, as Mr. Seton well observes, the\r\norigin of its bearings \"is veiled by the mists of Antiquity.\" The same\r\nShield, without any modification or change, was borne by all the\r\nSovereigns of Scotland.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 138.--Royal Arms of Scotland.]\r\n\r\nJAMES I.: CHARLES I.: CHARLES II.: JAMES II.: WILLIAM III. and MARY: and\r\nANNE, till May 1, 1707: _Quarterly_: 1 _and_ 4, _Grand Quarters, France\r\nModern and England_ (No. 253): 2, _Grand Quarter, Scotland_ (No. 138):\r\n3, _Grand Quarter--Az., a harp or, stringed arg., for Ireland_: No. 423.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 423.--Royal Arms of the Stuart Sovereigns.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 425.--Diagram of Shield of William III. and Mary.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 424.--Arms of Nassau.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 426.--Diagram of Shield of William III. alone.]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM III., as an elected Sovereign, charged his paternal shield of\r\nNASSAU, No. 424--_Az., billettée, a lion rampt. or_,--in pretence upon\r\nthe Royal Shield: also, during the life of his Consort, till Dec. 28,\r\n1694, he bore the _Stuart_ shield with _Nassau_ in pretence on the\r\ndexter half of his Shield, and thus impaled in the sinister half of his\r\nShield the same Stuart arms, as in the Diagram, No. 425, to denote their\r\njoint Sovereignty: the Shield represented in this Diagram, No. 425,\r\nbears the whole of No. 423 on its dexter half, with No. 424 in pretence;\r\nand on its sinister half it also bears the whole of No. 423. When he\r\nreigned alone, WILLIAM III. bore his own dexter half of the impaled\r\nShield alone, as in the Diagram, No. 426: the Shield represented in this\r\nDiagram being the dexter half of No. 425.\r\n\r\nQueen ANNE, from May 1, 1707, till 1714, bore the Royal Arms marshalled\r\nas in the Diagram, No. 427:--1 and 2, _England_ impaling _Scotland_; 3,\r\n_France Modern_ (No. 253); 4, _Ireland_ (the Harp, as in the third\r\nquarter of No. 423).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 427.--Diagram of the Second Royal Shield\r\n  of Queen Anne.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 428.--Arms of Hanover.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 429.--Diagram of the Royal Shield\r\n  from A.D. 1714 to 1801.]\r\n\r\nThe Arms of HANOVER, on the accession of GEORGE I., August 1, 1714, were\r\nadded to the Shield of the United Kingdom. This was accomplished by\r\nremoving the charges (_England and Scotland impaled_) from the fourth\r\nquarter of the Shield, No. 427, and charging that quarter with the arms\r\nof _Hanover_ as they appear on the Shield, No. 428:--_Per pale and per\r\nchevron_, 1, _Gu., two lions passant guardant or_, for _Brunswick_: 2,\r\n_Or, Semée of hearts, a lion rampt. az._, for _Lunenburgh_: 3, _Gu.,\r\na horse courant arg._, for _Westphalia_: 4, _Over all, on an\r\ninescutcheon gules, the golden crown of Charlemagne_.

HENRY V. also first _arched the circlet with jewelled bands_,\r\nwhich at their intersection he surmounted with a _mound and cross_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 234.--Crown of H.M., The King.]\r\n\r\nThe arched Crown of HENRY V. has four half-arches,--that is, it is\r\narched over twice: HENRY VI. and CHARLES I. arched their crown three\r\ntimes: all the other Sovereigns have had two complete arches only, and\r\nthe Crown still retains these two arches intersecting at right angles,\r\nas in No. 234. At different periods, while the design of the Crown has\r\nremained unchanged, the contour of the arches, and the artistic\r\ntreatment of the ornamentation have undergone various modifications.\r\n\r\nThe ROYAL BANNERS, or STANDARDS, are charged with the bearings of the\r\nRoyal Shield of Arms for the time being.\r\n\r\nThe Armorial Insignia of H.R.H. the late PRINCE CONSORT. The SHIELD\r\nwas--_Quarterly_, 1 _and_ 4,--_The Royal Arms of the late Queen_, as in\r\nNo. 416, but differenced with _a silver label of three points charged on\r\nthe central point with a cross of St. George_: 2 _and_ 3,--_Saxony_, No.\r\n225. This Shield was encircled with the Garter of the Order, and\r\nensigned with the Prince's own Coronet, shown in No. 441.\r\n\r\nThe CREST was the _Royal Crest of England_, No. 431, the lion having the\r\nsame _label_ that differences the Shield adjusted about his neck as a\r\ncollar, and being crowned with the coronet, _vide_ No. 441, in place of\r\nthe Imperial Crown.\r\n\r\nThe SUPPORTERS were those of the Royal Arms, _the golden lion and silver\r\nunicorn_, both of them differenced with the same _label_, and the lion\r\ncrowned with the same coronet.\r\n\r\nThe Motto.--TREU . UND . FEST--\"True and Faithful.\" To the dexter of\r\nthis Achievement, the complete Royal Achievement of QUEEN VICTORIA.\r\n\r\nThe Arms of KING EDWARD VII. were and those of KING GEORGE V. are\r\npractically the same as those of QUEEN VICTORIA. As PRINCES OF WALES,\r\nthese Arms were differenced by a plain _label_ of three points argent,\r\nand an inescutcheon of SAXONY was superimposed. In each case upon\r\naccession to the throne, the inescutcheon of Saxony was removed, and\r\nconsequently there has been no change whatsoever in the Royal Arms,\r\nthose of KING EDWARD and KING GEORGE being the same as those of QUEEN\r\nVICTORIA, save, of course, the necessary change in the Royal\r\nCyphers--the full blazon of the Royal Arms for the present reign\r\nbeing:--\r\n\r\nARMS.-- _Quarterly_, 1 _and_ 4, _gules, three lions passant guardant in\r\npale or_ (ENGLAND); 2, _or, a lion rampant within a double tressure\r\nflory and counterflory gules_ (SCOTLAND); 3, _azure, a harp or, stringed\r\nargent_ (IRELAND).\r\n\r\nHELMET--_of gold, affronté and with grylles_.\r\n\r\nMANTLING, _cloth of gold lined with ermine_.\r\n\r\nCRESTS _upon the Imperial Crown, a lion statant guardant, crowned or_\r\n(ENGLAND).\r\n\r\n_Upon the Crown of Scotland, a lion sejant erect affronté gules; crowned\r\nor, holding in the dexter paw a sword, and in the sinister a sceptre,\r\nboth proper_ (SCOTLAND).\r\n\r\nOn a Wreath, _or and azure, a tower triple-towered of the first, from\r\nthe portal a hart springing argent, attired and unguled gold_ (IRELAND).\r\n\r\nSUPPORTERS (dexter), _a lion guardant or, crowned as the crest_;\r\n(sinister), _a unicorn argent, armed, crined and unguled or, gorged with\r\na coronet composed of crosses patée and fleurs de lis, a chain affixed\r\nthereto, passing between the forelegs and reflexed over the back of the\r\nlast_.\r\n\r\nBADGES.--\r\n\r\n  1. _The Red and White Rose, united and crowned_ (ENGLAND).\r\n\r\n  2. _The Thistle, crowned_ (SCOTLAND).\r\n\r\n  3. _A Harp or, stringed argent, crowned_ (IRELAND).\r\n\r\n  4. _A Trefoil slipped vert, crowned_ (IRELAND).\r\n\r\n  5. _The Rose, Thistle and Shamrock united on one stem and crowned_\r\n    (UNITED KINGDOM).\r\n\r\n  6. _A Shield, crowned and bearing the device of the Union Jack_\r\n    (UNITED KINGDOM).\r\n\r\n  7. _Upon a mount vert, a dragon passant with wings elevated gules_\r\n    (WALES). _N.B._--This badge is not crowned.\r\n\r\nMOTTO.--DIEU . ET . MON . DROIT in the compartment below the Shield,\r\nwith the Union, Rose, Shamrock, and Thistle engrafted on the same stem.\r\n\r\nThe Shield is encircled by the Garter of that Order.\r\n\r\nThe Arms of H.M. QUEEN ALEXANDRA, early in the reign of KING EDWARD,\r\nwere declared by Royal Warrant. Within the Garter are impaled (dexter)\r\nthe Arms of KING EDWARD VII. and (sinister) the undifferenced Arms of\r\nDENMARK as under:--\r\n\r\nThe ROYAL ARMS OF DENMARK. The Shield divided into four quarters by the\r\nnational _white cross_, having a _border of red_ to represent the red\r\nfield of the Danish Ensign. First Quarter:--DENMARK--_Or, semée of\r\nhearts gu., three lions pass. guard. in pale az._ Second\r\nQuarter:--SLESWICK--_Or, two lions pass. in pale az._ Third\r\nQuarter:--_Per fesse, in chief_, SWEDEN--_Az., three crowns or; in\r\nbase_, ICELAND--_Gu., a stock-fish arg., crowned or; impaling_, for\r\nFAROE ISLANDS--_Az., a buck pass. arg._; and, for GREENLAND--a _polar\r\nbear rampt. arg._ Fourth Quarter:--_Per fesse, in chief_, for\r\nJUTLAND--_Or, ten hearts, four, three, two, one, gu., and in chief a\r\nlion pass. az.; in base_, for VANDALIA--_Gu., a wyvern, its tail nowed\r\nand wings expanded, or_.\r\n\r\nOn an Inescutcheon, quarterly: First, for HOLSTEIN--_Gu., an\r\ninescutcheon per fesse arg. and of the first, in every point thereof a\r\nnail in triangle, between as many holly-leaves, all ppr._ Second, for\r\nSTORMERK--_Gu., a swan arg., gorged with a coronet or_.

QUEEN MARY, as declared by Royal Warrant, are:--Within\r\nthe Garter ensigned with the Royal Crown the Arms of the United Kingdom\r\nof Great Britain and Ireland impaling quarterly (for Cambridge) the\r\nRoyal Arms as borne by GEORGE III. differenced by a label of three\r\npoints arg., the centre point charged with the St. George's Cross, and\r\neach of the other points with two hearts in pale gu., 2nd and 3rd (for\r\nTeck) or, three stags' attires fesseways in pale, the point of each\r\nattire to the sinister sa., impaling or, three lions passant in pale\r\nsa., langued gu., the dexter fore paws of the last, over all an\r\ninescutcheon paly bendy sinister sa. and or. _Supporters_ (dexter)\r\na lion guardant or, crowned with the Royal Crown ppr.; (sinister) a stag\r\nppr.\r\n\r\nH.R.H. the PRINCE OF WALES bears a Shield--_Quarterly_, 1 _and_ 4,\r\nENGLAND; 2, SCOTLAND; 3, IRELAND, differenced by a plain _label of three\r\npoints argent_. In pretence over these Arms he bears an Inescutcheon of\r\nthe Arms of WALES, viz. quarterly or and gu., four lions passant\r\nguardant counter-changed, the Inescutcheon surmounted by the Coronet of\r\nthe Heir-Apparent. His Crest is the Crest of England, and his Supporters\r\nare also the same, but the Crest and each of the Supporters are\r\ndifferenced by a similar _label_, and for the Imperial Crown in the\r\nCrest and dexter supporter the coronet of the Prince of WALES is\r\nsubstituted. The Badges of the Prince of WALES are two:--viz. 1, _A\r\nplume of three ostrich feathers arg., quilled or, enfiled by a coronet\r\ncomposed of crosses patée and fleurs de lys_, with the MOTTO, \"ICH\r\nDIEN\": 2, _on a mount vert, a dragon passant with wings elevated gu.,\r\ndifferenced with a label of three points arg._ Below the SHIELD the\r\nMOTTO \"ICH DIEN\" is repeated, and the Shield is surrounded by the\r\nGarter.\r\n\r\nThe other PRINCES and PRINCESSES, younger children of the late QUEEN\r\nVICTORIA, all bore the Royal Arms of the Sovereign, the Princes on\r\n_Shields_, the Princesses on _Lozenges_. All their Royal Highnesses bore\r\nthe Royal _Supporters_; all have a Shield of _Saxony_, in pretence on\r\ntheir own Shield or Lozenge; all ensign their Shield or Lozenge with\r\ntheir own Coronet, No. 290; and the Princes bear the Royal _Crest_. In\r\nevery case, the dexter Supporter is crowned and the sinister Supporter\r\nis gorged, and the Crest stands upon and is ensigned with the same\r\nCoronet which appears above the Shield as their particular coronet of\r\nrank: all the Shields, Lozenges, Crests, and Supporters, are differenced\r\nwith a _silver label of three points, the labels being differenced_ as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nH.R.H. the late Duke of EDINBURGH, &c.:--_On the central point a red\r\ncross; on each of the other two points a red anchor_ (when the Duke\r\nsucceeded to the throne of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, a radical change in\r\nhis Arms was made). H.R.H. the Duke of CONNAUGHT:--_Red cross, and two\r\nblue fleurs de lys_. H.R.H. the late Duke of ALBANY:--_Red cross, and\r\ntwo red hearts_. H.I.M. the late GERMAN EMPRESS, PRINCESS ROYAL OF\r\nENGLAND, on the central point of her _label_ had a _red rose_, and on\r\neach of the other two points a _red cross_. H.R.H. the late Princess\r\nALICE OF HESSE had on her _label_ a _red rose_, between two _ermine\r\nspots_. H.R.H. the Princess HELENA, Princess CHRISTIAN, has on her\r\n_label_ a _red cross_ between two _red roses_. H.R.H. the Princess\r\nLOUISE (Duchess of ARGYLL):--_Red rose, and two red cantons_. H.R.H. the\r\nPrincess BEATRICE:--_Red heart, and two red roses_.\r\n\r\nThe Warrants for the three daughters of King EDWARD were issued in the\r\nlifetime of Queen VICTORIA when they were grandchildren of the\r\nSovereign, and no change has since been made. Consequently the _labels_\r\nare of _five points_ instead of _three_. The Charges upon the label of\r\nH.R.H. the Duchess of FIFE (Princess ROYAL OF ENGLAND) are: _Three red\r\ncrosses, and two thistles slipped alternately_. H.R.H. Princess VICTORIA\r\nhas a _label_ of _five points argent_, charged with _three roses_ and\r\n_two crosses gules_; and H.M. the Queen of NORWAY a similar _label_,\r\ncharged with _three hearts_ and _two crosses gules_.\r\n\r\nThe _label_ of H.R.H. the first Duke of CAMBRIDGE was silver, of three\r\npoints, and the points differenced with _a red cross_ in the centre, and\r\non each of the two side points _two red hearts in pale_. The second and\r\nlate Duke bore the same _label_ as his father, and below it a second\r\n_label_ of three points _gules_. The _label_ of H.R.H. the first Duke of\r\nCUMBERLAND (son of KING GEORGE III.) was of silver, and of _three\r\npoints_ charged with a _fleur de lys_ between _two crosses gules_. The\r\nsecond Duke bore an additional _label_ of _three points gules_, the\r\n_centre point_ charged with the _white horse of Hanover_. These Dukes\r\nbore the Royal Arms as used in the reign of GEORGE III. and not as\r\naltered for Queen VICTORIA, differencing the accessories as well as the\r\nShield with their _labels_.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 a warrant was issued for H.R.H. Prince ARTHUR OF CONNAUGHT. The\r\nlabel was of five points charged with three red crosses and two blue\r\nfleurs de lys alternately. The coronet assigned to him was of crosses\r\npatée and strawberry leaves alternately.\r\n\r\nAn interesting warrant was issued for the Princess VICTORIA EUGENIE OF\r\nBATTENBERG, now Queen of SPAIN, in view of her then approaching\r\nmarriage. This assigned to her the arms of her father within a bordure\r\nof England, and each of the supporters had a banner of the Royal Arms of\r\nthe United Kingdom placed in his paws.\r\n\r\nEven more interesting was the warrant issued in 1913 to H.H. Princess\r\nALEXANDRA, Duchess of FIFE. This assigned to her upon a lozenge the\r\nRoyal Arms, differenced by the same label as that of her mother the\r\nPrincess Royal, and upon an inescutcheon the quarterly coat of Duff, the\r\ninescutcheon being surmounted by the coronet of a Duchess of the United\r\nKingdom, and the lozenge itself being surmounted by the coronet of a\r\nPrincess of the rank of Highness. The dexter supporter is the Royal Lion\r\nof England crowned with the last-mentioned coronet and charged with the\r\nlabel as in the arms. The sinister supporter is a savage taken from the\r\nsupporters of the late Duke of Fife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nORDERS OF KNIGHTHOOD AND INSIGNIA OF HONOUR\r\n\r\n  _Feudal Knighthood-- Orders of Knighthood: Knights of St. John;\r\n  Knights Templars; The Order of the Garter; of the Thistle; of St.\r\n  Patrick; of the Bath; of St. Michael and St. George; of The Star of\r\n  India-- Order of Merit-- Royal Victorian Order-- Imperial Service\r\n  Order-- The Victoria Cross-- The Albert Medal-- Naval and Military\r\n  Medals-- Foreign Insignia bestowed on British Subjects._\r\n\r\n  \"The same King would make an Order of KNIGHTS of himself\r\n  and his Sons, and of the bravest of his land.\"\r\n    --FROISSART.\r\n\r\n  \"I will say as I have said,--\r\n  Thou art a noble KNIGHT.\"\r\n    --LORD OF THE ISLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nKNIGHTHOOD, as that term is generally understood in its comprehensive\r\nacceptation, has been well defined to be \"a distinction of rank amongst\r\nfreemen, depending not upon birth or property, but simply upon the\r\nadmission of the person so distinguished, by the girding of a sword or\r\nother similar solemnity, into an order of men having by law or usage\r\ncertain social or political privileges,\" and also a certain appropriate\r\ntitle. It is evident, therefore, from this definition that Knighthood\r\nimplies the existence of these two conditions: the one, that the man to\r\nbe admitted to the rank of Knighthood should possess such qualifications\r\nas may entitle him to that distinction; and the other, that Knighthood\r\nshould be conferred by a personage endowed with a competent power and\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nIn feudal times the qualifications for Knighthood were military exploits\r\nof a distinguished character, and eminent services, of whatever kind,\r\nrendered to the King and the realm: also, the holding a certain property\r\nin land (in the time of EDWARD I., land then of the yearly value of £20,\r\nor upwards), whether directly from the King, or under some Noble, by the\r\nfeudal tenure of personal military service to be rendered under certain\r\nestablished conditions; but it has been disputed whether there was any\r\nnecessary connection between Knighthood, as such, and the Knight Service\r\nof Feudal Tenure. During the first two centuries after the Conquest,\r\nKnighthood was conferred by the great Barons and by the Spiritual Peers,\r\nas well as by the King himself, or by his appointed representative: but,\r\nafter the accession of HENRY III., the prevailing rule appears to have\r\nbeen that in England no persons should be created Knights except by the\r\nKing, or the Prince Royal acting for his Father, or by the King's\r\nGeneral-in-Chief, or other personal representative.\r\n\r\nThe knightly rank, as it gave an increase of dignity, implied also the\r\nmaintenance of a becoming state, and the discharge of certain civil\r\nduties: and, more particularly, all Knights were required to make such a\r\nprovision for rendering military service as was held to be consistent\r\nwith their position and their property; and it was expected from them\r\nthat they should take a dignified part in the chivalrous exercises and\r\ncelebrations of their times. It followed, that feudal Knighthood was a\r\ndistinction which, if not conferred for the sake of honour, became\r\nobligatory; and fines, accordingly, were imposed upon men qualified for\r\nKnighthood who, notwithstanding, were found not to be Knights. In the\r\ncourse of time, as the rigour of the feudal system abated, the numbers\r\nof the military tenants of small tenures greatly increased: and, since\r\nmany of these persons had no inclination for the profession of arms,\r\nthey gladly accepted the alternative of paying a fine, which enabled\r\nthem to evade an honour unsuited as well to their means as to their\r\npersonal tastes and their peaceful avocations. A fruitful source of\r\nrevenue thus was secured for the Crown, while the military character of\r\nKnighthood was maintained, and at the same time a new and important\r\nclass of the community gradually became established.\r\n\r\nThe Knights of Norman England, who at first were soldiers of the highest\r\norder, derived their designation from their warlike predecessors of\r\nAnglo-Saxon times, the word \"_cniht_,\" in the late Anglo-Saxon tongue,\r\nsignifying a military attendant. When they had established themselves in\r\nthe position and in the possession of the lands of the Anglo-Saxons, the\r\nAnglo-Norman Knights retained their own original title. The Latin\r\nequivalent for that title of \"Knight\" is \"_Miles_,\" and the\r\nNorman-French is \"_Chevalier_.\"\r\n\r\nThese Knights may be grouped in two classes. The first class contains\r\nall persons who had been admitted into the comprehensive Order of\r\nChivalry--who were Knights by reason of their common Knighthood. The\r\nsecond class is formed of Knights who, in addition to their Knightly\r\nrank, were members of some special and distinct Fraternity,\r\nCompanionship, or Order of Knighthood. Every Society of this kind has\r\nalways possessed Laws, Institutions, Titles, and Insignia peculiar to\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar character and object of the Crusades led to the formation\r\nof two Orders of _Priest-Knights_--Orders not belonging to any\r\nparticular nation, but numbering amongst their members men of all\r\nnations. These are the Orders of the KNIGHTS OF ST. JOHN OF JERUSALEM,\r\nor HOSPITALLERS, and of the KNIGHTS TEMPLARS.\r\n\r\nThe HOSPITALLERS, instituted about A.D. 1092, were introduced into\r\nEngland about 1100. In the year 1310 they were established at Rhodes,\r\nand in 1530 at Malta, under their forty-third Grand Master, PHILIPPE DE\r\nVILLIERS DE L'ISLE-ADAM. Their device is a _silver cross of eight\r\npoints_, No. 107, charged upon a _black field_, or worn upon a black\r\nsurcoat or mantle. The Order was finally suppressed in England in 1559.\r\n\r\nThe TEMPLARS, instituted about A.D. 1118, were introduced into England\r\nabout 1140. In the year 1309 they were suppressed, and in 1312 their\r\nOrder was finally abolished. They wore _a Cross_ of the same form as No.\r\n107, but of a _red colour upon a white field_. This red cross they\r\ncharged upon a white banner: and they bore another banner, No. 13, of\r\n_black and white_, entitled \"_Beau Seant_.\" The same words, \"_Beau\r\nSeant!_\" were their war-cry. The Badges of the Templars were the _Agnus\r\nDei_--the Holy Lamb, holding a red-cross banner; and a device\r\nrepresenting two Knights mounted on a single horse, intended to denote\r\nthe original poverty of the Order.[8]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: The Arms of the Inner Temple of the present day\r\n    are--_Azure, a pegasus_ (or winged horse) _argent_, or sometimes\r\n    _or_. This Coat is derived from the early Badge, _the two horsemen_\r\n    having been mistaken in later times for _wings_. The Arms of the\r\n    Middle Temple are--_Argent, on a cross gules_, the Agnus Dei.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 433.--Insignia of the Order of the Garter.]\r\n\r\nTHE ORDER OF THE GARTER, a military Fraternity under the special\r\npatronage of \"ST. GEORGE, the good Knight,\" was instituted at Windsor by\r\nKing EDWARD III. in, or about, the year 1350--very probably in the\r\nsummer of 1348, but the exact time is not positively known. It may\r\nsafely be assumed, that the occasion which led to the institution of\r\nthis most noble and renowned Order, was a Tournament or Hastilude of\r\nunusual importance held at his Castle of Windsor by EDWARD III. at the\r\nmost brilliant period of his reign: and it is highly probable that the\r\nOrder suggested itself to the mind of the King, as a natural result of\r\nhis own chivalrous revival of a knightly \"Round Table,\" such as\r\nflourished in the days of King Arthur. How much of historical fact there\r\nmay be in the popular legend, which professes to derive from a certain\r\nromantic incident the Title certainly borne by King EDWARD'S Order from\r\nthe time of its original institution, it is not possible to determine:\r\nbut the legend itself is not in any way inconsistent with the spirit of\r\nthose times; nor would the Knights Founders of the Garter regard their\r\nOrder as the less honourable, because its Title might remind them of the\r\nhappy gallantry, with which the casual misadventure of a noble Lady had\r\nbeen turned to so good an account by a most princely Monarch. The\r\nStatutes of the Order have been continually modified and altered, and\r\nthe original military character of the Institution has long ceased to\r\nexist: still, no changes in the Order of the Garter have affected the\r\npre-eminence of its dignity and reputation. Illustrious now as ever, and\r\nforemost in rank and honour in our own country, the GARTER is second to\r\nno knightly Order in the world.\r\n\r\nThe MOST NOBLE ORDER OF THE GARTER consists of the SOVEREIGN and\r\nTwenty-five KNIGHTS COMPANIONS, of whom the PRINCE OF WALES always is\r\none. By a Statute of the year 1805, the Order includes such lineal\r\ndescendants of GEORGE III. as may be elected: and still more recent\r\nstatutes have provided for the admission of foreign Sovereigns, and also\r\nof certain \"Extra Knights,\" who are elected \"Companions\" as vacancies\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nThe OFFICERS of the Order are--The _Prelate_, the Bishop of Winchester:\r\nthe _Chancellor_, the Bishop of Oxford: the _Registrar_, the Dean of\r\nWindsor: the _Herald_, Garter King of Arms: and, the _Usher of the Black\r\nRod_.\r\n\r\nKnights of the Garter place the initials \"K.G.\" after their names; and\r\nthese letters take precedence of all other titles, those of Royalty\r\nalone excepted.\r\n\r\nThe Stalls of the Knights are in the choir of St. George's Chapel,\r\nWindsor Castle, where their Garter-plates are fixed, and their Banners\r\nare displayed.\r\n\r\nThe INSIGNIA of the Order of the Garter are--The _Garter_ itself, of a\r\nlight blue originally, now of a dark blue, with border, buckle, and\r\npendant of gold. On it, in golden letters, the\r\n_Motto_--HONI . SOIT . QVI . MAL . Y . PENSE--\"Dishonour to him who\r\nthinks ill of it;\" and not, as it is commonly rendered, \"Evil to him\r\nthat evil thinks.\"\r\n\r\nThe Badge of the Order is circular, and formed of a buckled Garter\r\nenclosing a Shield of St. George, the whole blazoned in the proper\r\ntinctures: it is worn on the left shoulder of the blue velvet Mantle.\r\nWhen irradiated with eight rays of silver or diamonds, a device\r\nresembling the Badge in every respect, except that the cross of St.\r\nGeorge is enclosed within the Garter without being charged on a Shield,\r\nforms the _Star_ of the Order.\r\n\r\nThe _Collar_, of gold enamelled, is formed of twelve buckled Garters,\r\neach encircling a Tudor Rose, and as many knots of intertwined cords.\r\nAttached to this Collar is the _George_--a mounted figure of the Saint\r\nin the act of trampling down the dragon and piercing him with his lance.\r\nThe Collar and George were added to the Insignia by HENRY VII.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 434.--The Lesser George, of the Garter.]\r\n\r\nThe _Lesser George_, or _Jewel_, added by HENRY VIII., has the same\r\ndevice placed on an enamelled field, and forming a jewel generally oval\r\nin form; it is encircled by a buckled Garter of the Order, and\r\nrepresented in No. 434. It was this Lesser George that CHARLES I.,\r\nimmediately before he suffered, delivered to Archbishop JUXON, with the\r\nword, \"Remember.\" As a matter of course, the figure of ST. GEORGE ought\r\nalways to be represented as a Knight, armed and equipped as one of the\r\nChristian chivalry of the Middle Ages--not as a pagan horseman of\r\nantiquity, and more particularly not in the guise of such a nude\r\nchampion as appears on some of our modern coins. The Lesser George,\r\noften incorrectly called the Badge, at first was sometimes worn from a\r\ngold chain, and sometimes from a _black Ribbon_. The Colour of the\r\nribbon was changed to _sky blue_ by Queen ELIZABETH; and it has since\r\nbeen again changed to the _dark blue_ of the broad Ribbon now worn. This\r\n_Ribbon_ of the Order crosses the figure of the wearer, passing over the\r\nleft shoulder, and the Lesser George hangs from it under the right arm.\r\n\r\nSince the time of CHARLES II. it has been customary for the nearest\r\nrepresentatives of a deceased K.G. to return his Insignia to the\r\nSovereign.\r\n\r\nEach Officer of the Order, except the Usher, has his own proper Badge.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 450.--Insignia of the Order of the Thistle.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ORDER OF THE THISTLE, OF SCOTLAND, styled \"Most Noble and Most\r\nAncient,\" and indicated by the Initials \"K.T.,\" was originally\r\ninstituted long before the accession of a Scottish Sovereign to the\r\nCrown of England; but it is now governed by statutes framed by JAMES II.\r\nof Great Britain, ANNE, and GEORGE IV.\r\n\r\nThe Order consists of the SOVEREIGN and sixteen KNIGHTS. Its OFFICERS\r\nare--The _Dean_; _the Lord Lyon King of Arms_; and the _Gentleman Usher\r\nof the Green Rod_.\r\n\r\nThe INSIGNIA are--The _Badge_ of gold enamelled, being a figure of St.\r\nAndrew standing upon a mount holding his silver Saltire and surrounded\r\nby rays in the form of a glory. This Badge is worn from the _Collar_ of\r\nthe Order, formed of sixteen Thistles alternating with as many bunches\r\nof rue-sprigs; or, from a broad _dark green Ribbon_, which crosses the\r\nleft shoulder. There are fine examples of these Insignia sculptured upon\r\nthe Monument of MARY, Queen of Scots, in Westminster Abbey. The jewel is\r\nshown in No. 435.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 435.--Jewel of the Thistle.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 436.--Badge of St. Patrick.]\r\n\r\nThe _Star_ of this Order, of silver or diamonds, is in the form of a St.\r\nAndrew's Saltire, having its four limbs alternating with the four points\r\nof a lozenge: in the centre, surrounded by the Motto (NEMO ME IMPUNE\r\nLACESSIT), is a Thistle proper.\r\n\r\nThe Most Illustrious Order of ST. PATRICK, OF IRELAND, indicated by the\r\nInitials, \"K.P.\", and instituted in 1783 by GEORGE III., consists of the\r\nSOVEREIGN, the GRAND MASTER, and twenty-two KNIGHTS. The OFFICERS are\r\nthe Grand Master, the _Chancellor_, the _Secretary_, _Ulster King of\r\nArms_ and _Registrar_, two _Heralds_, and one _Pursuivant_, the\r\n_Genealogist_, and the _Usher of the Black Rod_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 451.--Insignia of the Order of St. Patrick.]\r\n\r\nThe INSIGNIA are--The _Badge_ or _Jewel_, of gold enamelled, and oval in\r\nform. It has a Shamrock (or Trefoil slipped) having on each leaf a Royal\r\nCrown, charged on the Saltire of St. Patrick, the field being surrounded\r\nby the _Motto_--QVIS . SEPARABIT . (\"Who will sever?\") MDCCLXXXIII., on\r\na blue band, which in its turn is encircled with a wreath of Shamrocks\r\non gold. This Badge, No. 436, is worn from the _Collar_, composed of\r\nRoses and Harps, alternating with each other and with knotted cords,\r\na Crown surmounting a Harp being in the centre; or, the Badge is worn\r\nfrom a broad _sky-blue Ribbon_, crossing the right shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe _Star_ resembles the Badge, except that its centre is circular\r\ninstead of oval; and that it has eight rays of silver or diamonds, in\r\nplace of the wreath of Shamrocks.\r\n\r\nThe Most Honourable ORDER OF THE BATH is an early Institution which,\r\nafter having long been in abeyance, has been revived and remodelled, and\r\nhas received fresh statutes in the years 1725, 1815, 1847, and 1859.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 452.--Collar and Military Badge.\r\n  Insignia of the Order of the Bath.]\r\n\r\nThe Order, now numbering about a thousand members, consists of several\r\ndistinct Groups or Classes, which include, with the SOVEREIGN, the Royal\r\nPrinces, and some few distinguished Foreigners, Officers of our own Navy\r\nand Army, and also Diplomatic and Civil Servants of the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe Three \"Classes\" of the Order alike include members of the Three\r\nServices, and each class is divided into two divisions, viz. Military\r\nand Civil.\r\n\r\nThe \"First Class,\" of KNIGHTS GRAND CROSS OF THE BATH--G.C.B.--has 55\r\nMilitary and 27 Civil Knights.\r\n\r\nThe \"Second Class\" numbers (with power to increase these numbers) 145\r\nMilitary and 108 Civil KNIGHTS COMMANDERS OF THE BATH--K.C.B.\r\n\r\nThe \"Third Class,\" not of Knights, but of COMPANIONS OF THE\r\nBATH--C.B.--has 705 Military and 298 Civil Members, who take rank\r\nbetween Knights and Esquires.\r\n\r\nThe MILITARY INSIGNIA are--The BADGE, a complicated combination of\r\ndevices, characteristic of the debased period which produced it. It is\r\nrepresented in No. 437.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 437.--Badge of the Bath (Military Division).]\r\n\r\nThe Cross is white; the circle with the Motto, red; and the small scroll\r\nin base, blue; all the rest being enamelled \"proper.\" This Badge is worn\r\nby the G.C.B. attached to a _Collar_, formed of nine Crowns and eight\r\nclusters of the Rose, Thistle, and Shamrock issuing from a Sceptre,\r\nalternating with seventeen Knots enamelled argent: or, this Badge is\r\nsuspended by the G.C.B. from a broad _red Ribbon_, crossing the left\r\nshoulder. By the K.C.B. the Badge is worn from a narrower red Ribbon\r\nabout the neck, or a still narrower at the button-hole. Also, by the\r\nC.B. it is attached to a narrow red Ribbon at the button-hole.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 453.--Star of Knight Grand Cross (Civil).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 454.--Star of Knight Commander (Military).]\r\n\r\nThe _Star_ of the G.C.B. is similar to the Badge without The Cross and\r\nthe lions, surrounded by silver rays having a lozenge-shaped outline.\r\nThe _Star_ of the K.C.B., which is in the form of a Maltese Cross, omits\r\nthe Cross of the Badge. The C.B. have no Star.\r\n\r\nThe Diplomatic and Civil INSIGNIA are--The _Badge_, No. 438, worn with\r\nthe same distinctions as the Naval and Military Badge; but the C.B.\r\nBadge is of smaller size than the Badges of the two higher Classes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 438.--Badge of the Bath (Civil Division).]\r\n\r\nThe _Star_ of the G.C.B. has eight silver rays encircling their Badge in\r\na circular form. The Star of the K.C.B. is the same as that of the Naval\r\nand Military K.C.B., omitting the laurel-wreath and the small scroll and\r\nmotto.\r\n\r\nThe _Motto_ of the Order--TRIA . JUNCTA . IN . UNO--\"Three united in\r\none,\" refers to the Union of the three Realms of England, Scotland, and\r\nIreland, in the Order.\r\n\r\nThe _Stalls_ of the Knights of the Bath, before the Order was divided\r\ninto classes, and those of their Esquires, are in Henry the Seventh's\r\nChapel, Westminster Abbey; but no installation has taken place since\r\n1815, when the Order was reorganised, and no new plates or banners have\r\nbeen set up.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 455.--Order of Merit.]\r\n\r\nTHE ORDER OF MERIT (O.M.) instituted in the year 1902, although it gives\r\nto its members neither style nor precedence, ranks next to the Order of\r\nthe Bath, and is divided into two classes, Military and Civil. The only\r\nInsignia are the Badge and the Ribbon parti-coloured of _red_ and\r\n_blue_. The Badge is _a cross pateé of four arms_, the outline of the\r\ncross being circular. The cross is of _blue enamel_ and superimposed\r\nthereupon a smaller cross of the same design of _red_. The centre is\r\n_blue_, bearing the words, \"FOR MERIT,\" in gold letters within a laurel\r\nwreath. The cross is surmounted by the Royal Crown. The reverse of the\r\nBadge shows the Royal and Imperial Cypher. To the Badge _two swords\r\nsaltirewise_ in the angles of the cross are added in the case of members\r\nof the Military Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 456.--Collar and Insignia of the Exalted Order\r\n  of the Star of India.]\r\n\r\nThe Most Exalted ORDER OF THE STAR OF INDIA, instituted by Queen\r\nVictoria in 1861, to render especial honour to high merit and loyalty in\r\nthe Indian Empire, was enlarged on the 24th of May 1866, and ordained to\r\nconsist of the SOVEREIGN, a GRAND MASTER, and 291 Ordinary COMPANIONS or\r\nMEMBERS; together with such extra and Honorary Members as the Sovereign\r\nat any time may be pleased to appoint.\r\n\r\nThe VICEROY AND GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF INDIA for the time being is always\r\nthe GRAND MASTER. The Ordinary Members are divided into Three\r\nClasses:--The \"First Class\" comprises 36 KNIGHTS GRAND COMMANDERS:\r\nG.C.S.I. In the \"Second Class\" there are 85 KNIGHTS COMMANDERS: K.S.I.\r\nAnd, the \"Third Class\" numbers 170 COMPANIONS: C.S.I.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 439.--Badge of the Star of India.]\r\n\r\nThe INSIGNIA are--The _Badge_, No. 439, formed of diamonds, having the\r\nMotto on a field of light blue enamel, and the bust of the late Queen\r\nexecuted as an onyx cameo. This Badge is attached by a mullet to the\r\n_Collar_, composed of heraldic roses and lotus flowers alternating with\r\npalm-branches, a crown being in the Centre: or, the Badge is worn from a\r\n_Ribbon of pale blue with white borders_ crossing the left shoulder. The\r\n_Star_, of diamonds, has a mullet upon an irradiated field in its\r\ncentre, within the _Motto_--HEAVEN'S . LIGHT . OUR . GUIDE, the whole\r\nbeing environed with wavy rays having a circular outline.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Most Distinguished ORDER OF ST. MICHAEL AND ST. GEORGE, originally\r\ninstituted in 1818 for use in Malta and the Ionian Islands, has been\r\nextended and enlarged in 1868, 1877, and 1902, and now is awarded for\r\nColonial and for Foreign Services. It consists of 100 KNIGHTS GRAND\r\nCROSS (G.C.M.G.), 300 KNIGHTS COMMANDERS (K.C.M.G.), and 600 COMPANIONS\r\n(C.M.G.), in addition to Honorary Members. The numbers are not adhered\r\nto. The _Star_ is of seven long rays, smaller rays intervening. This is\r\ncharged with the Cross of St. George, and in the centre is a\r\nrepresentation of St. Michael encountering Satan within a blue circle,\r\nbearing the Motto of the Order, \"AUSPICIUM MELIORIS ÆVI.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 457.--Star and Collar of the Order of St. Michael\r\n  and St. George.]\r\n\r\nThe _Collar_ is composed alternately of lions of England, Maltese\r\nCrosses, and Cyphers, S. M. and S. G. In the centre is the Crown\r\n_over two winged lions passant guardant, each holding a book and\r\nseven arrows_.\r\n\r\nThe _Badge_ is a gold cross of fourteen points of white enamel, and has\r\nin the centre, within the Motto of the Order (on the one side), St.\r\nMichael encountering Satan (and on the other side), St. George and the\r\nDragon. The Badge is surmounted by the Crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 458.--Eminent Order of the Indian Empire.]\r\n\r\nThe Most Eminent ORDER OF THE INDIAN EMPIRE, instituted in 1878 and\r\nsubsequently enlarged, is the second Indian Order, and consists of three\r\nclasses, KNIGHTS GRAND COMMANDERS (G.C.I.E.), KNIGHTS COMMANDERS\r\n(K.C.I.E.), and COMPANIONS (C.I.E.).\r\n\r\nThe _Star_ is of five rays of silver, alternated with as many rays of\r\ngold. In the centre, within a purple circle, inscribed with the Motto,\r\n\"IMPERATRICIS AUSPICIIS,\" and surmounted by the Crown, is an effigy of\r\nQueen VICTORIA.\r\n\r\nThe _Collar_ is composed of elephants, lotus-flowers, peacocks in their\r\npride, and Indian roses, all connected by gold chains.\r\n\r\nThe _Badge_ is a red enamelled rose, in the centre of which is the\r\neffigy within the Motto as on the Star.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 459.--The Badge.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 460.--G.C.V.O. Star.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 461.--K.C.V.O. Star.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 462.--G.C.V.O. Badge.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 463.--K.C.V.O. Badge.]\r\n\r\nThe ROYAL VICTORIAN ORDER was instituted in 1896 as the personal Order\r\nof the British Sovereign, and is divided into five classes--KNIGHTS\r\nGRAND CROSS (G.C.V.O.), KNIGHTS COMMANDERS (K.C.V.O.), COMMANDERS\r\n(C.V.O.), and Members of the Fourth and Fifth Classes (both M.V.O.).\r\n\r\nThe _Star_ is of eight points, and of chipped silver, having in the\r\ncentre a representation of the Badge.\r\n\r\nThe BADGE is a white Maltese Cross. It has an oval enamelled centre of\r\ncrimson with the monogram V. R. I., within a blue enamelled circle,\r\ncarrying the Motto of the Order \"VICTORIA,\" the circle surmounted by\r\nthe Crown. There is no collar for the order, but the King occasionally\r\nbestows, as an extreme mark of favour, \"The Royal Victorian Chain,\"\r\na decoration not governed by express Statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 464.--Distinguished Service Order.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 465.--Imperial Service Order.]\r\n\r\nThe DISTINGUISHED SERVICE ORDER is a Military Decoration instituted in\r\n1886, but which does not carry the style of Knighthood. The _Badge_ is a\r\ngold cross enamelled white and of a circular outline. In the centre (on\r\nthe one side) is the Crown on a red enamel ground within a wreath of\r\nlaurel, (and on the other side) the Royal Cypher takes the place of the\r\nCrown.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe IMPERIAL SERVICE ORDER, a purely Civil Decoration instituted in\r\n1902, is confined to the Administrative Services of the Empire. The\r\n_Badge_ is an eight-rayed star bearing (on one side) the Royal Cypher\r\nand (on the other side) \"For faithful service,\" surrounded by a wreath\r\nof laurel and surmounted by the Crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 440.--The Victoria Cross.]\r\n\r\nThe VICTORIA CROSS, of bronze, was instituted by her late Majesty Queen\r\nVICTORIA in 1856, to render honour to \"conspicuous bravery\" in actual\r\nconflict, by sea or land. This Cross, No. 440, is worn on the left\r\nbreast, attached to a _blue_ ribbon for the Navy, and to a _red_ ribbon\r\nfor the Army. A Bar is attached to the ribbon for every additional such\r\nact of bravery as would have won the Cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 441.--The Albert Medal.]\r\n\r\nThe ALBERT MEDAL, No. 441, which was instituted also by Queen VICTORIA,\r\ndates from March 13, 1866, and is to distinguish those who save, or who\r\nat the peril of their own lives endeavour to save, life or perform other\r\nmeritorious acts of bravery. The Coronet is that of H.R.H. the late\r\nPRINCE CONSORT; and the Monogram consists of the Initials V. A., with an\r\nanchor. This Medal is executed in Silver and Bronze for two classes of\r\nrecipients. The anchor in the Badge is omitted when awarded for land\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nOther Decorations are \"The Royal Order of Victoria and Albert\" (of four\r\nclasses) and the Imperial Order of the Crown of India (of one class),\r\nboth confined to ladies, the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal, the Volunteer\r\nOfficers' Decoration, the Territorial Decoration, the Edward Medal, the\r\nKing's Police Medal, the Royal Red Cross, and the Order of Mercy; whilst\r\nthe Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem in England receives\r\nofficial recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nPRECEDENCE. GENEALOGIES\r\n\r\n      \"Orders and Degrees\r\n  Jar not with Liberty, but well consist.\"\r\n    --_Paradise Lost_, Book V.\r\n\r\n  \"The use of Arms was closely connected with the Study of Genealogy.\"\r\n    --DALLAWAY, _Science of Heraldry_ (A.D. 1793).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen JAMES I. succeeded to the Crown of England while he was actually\r\nthe King regnant of Scotland, and accordingly became Sovereign of the\r\ntwo Realms, he found it necessary to produce a \"Union Flag\" for the\r\nwhole of Great Britain, in consequence of the serious disputes for\r\nPrecedence that arose between the natives of South and North Britain.\r\nBefore the time of the peace-loving son of Mary Stuart, a Sovereign of\r\nanother mould, HENRY VIII., had felt the necessity of framing and\r\nestablishing some definite system of Precedence amongst the various\r\ndegrees, orders, and ranks of his subjects: and, in 1539, a statute to\r\nthat effect was enacted. Other statutes afterwards were added; and, from\r\ntime to time, Royal Letters Patent on the same subject have been issued;\r\nand thus the Precedence now recognised and in use amongst us has been\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThe General Scale of Precedence follows, but there are Special scales\r\nfor use in (_a_) Scotland, (_b_) Ireland, (_c_) India, (_d_) Canada,\r\n(_e_) Colonies, (_f_) Army and Navy, (_g_) Diplomatic Service.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ORDER OF PRECEDENCE.\r\n\r\n  The SOVEREIGN.\r\n  The Prince of Wales.\r\n  The Younger Sons of the Sovereign.\r\n  The Grandsons of the

progression).\r\n  Knights Bachelors.\r\n  Commanders of Victorian Order.\r\n  County Court Judges.\r\n  Serjeants-at-Law.\r\n  Masters in Lunacy.\r\n  Companions of the various Orders.\r\n  Members of Fourth Class of Victorian Order.\r\n  Companions of Distinguished Service Order.\r\n    Eldest Sons of the Younger Sons of Peers.\r\n    Eldest Sons of Baronets.\r\n    Eldest Sons of Knights.\r\n  Members of Fifth Class of Victorian Order.\r\n    Baronets' Younger Sons.\r\n    Knights' Younger Sons.\r\n  Esquires:--Including\r\n    the Eldest Sons of the Sons of Viscounts and Barons,\r\n    the eldest Sons of all the younger Sons of Peers,\r\n    and their eldest Sons in perpetual Succession:\r\n    the younger Sons of Baronets:\r\n    the Sons of Knights,\r\n    the eldest Son of the eldest Son of a Knight\r\n      in perpetual Succession:\r\n    persons holding the King's Commission,\r\n    or who may be styled \"Esquire\" by the King in any Official Document.\r\n  Gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRECEDENCE OF WOMEN\r\n\r\nis determined, before marriage, by the Rank and Dignity, but not by the\r\nOffice, of their Father.\r\n\r\nAll the unmarried Sisters in any family have the same Degree, which is\r\nthe Degree that their eldest Brother holds (or would hold) amongst men.\r\nThus:--Of the Sons of an Earl the _eldest_ alone has an honorary Title\r\nof Nobility and is styled \"My Lord,\" while _all_ the Daughters of an\r\nEarl have a similar honorary Title, and are styled \"My Lady.\"\r\n\r\nBy Marriage Women share the Dignities and Precedence of their Husbands:\r\nbut, the strictly Official Dignity of a Husband is not imparted to a\r\nwife (except in India), in the case of the Archbishops and Bishops or\r\nholders of other offices.\r\n\r\nThe Dignities which Ladies have by Birth or by right of Inheritance, are\r\nnot imparted by Marriage to their Husbands: nor does Marriage with an\r\ninferior in Dignity in any way affect the Precedence that a Lady may\r\nenjoy by Birth, Inheritance, or Creation--both her own Precedence and\r\nthat of her Husband remain as before their Marriage, unless the Husband\r\nbe a Peer.\r\n\r\nIn the ROYAL FAMILY the following Precedence takes effect:--\r\n\r\n  The Queen.\r\n  The Queen Dowager.\r\n  The Princess of Wales.\r\n  The Daughters of the Sovereign.\r\n  The Wives of the Younger Sons of the Sovereign.\r\n  The Granddaughters of the Sovereign.\r\n  The Wives of the Grandsons of the Sovereign.\r\n  The Sovereign's Sisters.\r\n  Wives of the Sovereign's Brothers.\r\n  The Sovereign's Aunts.\r\n  Wives of the Sovereign's Uncles.\r\n  The Sovereign's Nieces.\r\n  Wives of the Sovereign's Nephews (Brothers' and Sisters' Daughters).\r\n  Granddaughters of the Sovereign not bearing the style\r\n    of Royal Highness.\r\n\r\nTo whatever Precedence she may be entitled by Birth, the Wife of a Peer\r\nalways takes her rank, and therefore takes her actual Precedence, from\r\nher Husband.\r\n\r\nThe Widow of a Peer, so long as she remains a Widow, retains the rank\r\nshe enjoyed whilst married: but, should she contract a second Marriage,\r\nher Precedence then is determined either by the rank of her second\r\nHusband, or by the rank that was her own by Birth and which she enjoyed\r\nbefore her first Marriage.\r\n\r\nThe Wife of the Eldest Son of any degree precedes all her Husband's\r\nSisters, and also all other Ladies having the same degree of rank with\r\nthem. Thus:--the Wife of the Eldest Son of an Earl takes Precedence of\r\n_all_ Daughters of Earls. In actual practice, however, by a principle of\r\nPrecedence that is accepted and adopted in all families of the same\r\ndegree amongst themselves, the Sisters in every case have their place\r\nimmediately after the Wife of their own Eldest Brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENEALOGIES.\r\n\r\nGENEALOGIES, the Records of the Descents and Alliances of Families, are\r\nnecessarily associated with the Armorial Ensigns borne by those\r\nFamilies, and by the several Members and Branches of them. Still, it\r\ndoes not apparently follow, in the same manner, as a matter of\r\nnecessity, that the study and investigation of Genealogies should be\r\ninteresting and even attractive, because interest and attractiveness are\r\ninseparable from Heraldry. And yet, I do not hesitate to claim for\r\ngenealogical researches the favourable regard of students of Armory, on\r\nthe very ground of the interest which they are certain to feel in such\r\nresearches; and also in confident reliance on that inherent power of\r\nattraction, inseparable from the subject itself, that will not fail both\r\nto win their favourable regard, and to lead them on from one inquiry to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe very act of tracing up some eminent and illustrious personage, from\r\ngeneration to generation of his forefathers, noting down the alliances\r\nthat have interwoven one thread of a brilliant line with others not less\r\nlustrous; or, the reverse of this process, the following the lineage of\r\nsome worthy of the olden time onward down the stream, observing both the\r\ntributaries that flow into the main channel and the streamlets that\r\nissue from it--all this, when once it has been systematically\r\nundertaken, leads the student through the most picturesque regions of\r\nhistorical romance.\r\n\r\nThe popular idea of Genealogy may be, that it consists in placing in a\r\nformal order of arrangement a series of dry names, connected with dates\r\nthat (if it be possible) are even more dry. It is not uncommon to\r\ndispose of many things precisely in the same way, when an opinion is\r\nformed without even the slightest attempt to judge of a question by its\r\ntrue merits--it is so easy to decline the trouble and to avoid the\r\neffort attendant on inquiry and investigation, and so pleasant to become\r\nthe possessor of an \"opinion\" and \"views,\" without any outlay in\r\nacquiring them. A Map has no value in the estimation of those who ignore\r\nGeography: the claims of Archæology are disregarded by all who are\r\ncontent to remain in ignorance even of what it implies: and History\r\nitself becomes and continues to be a dead letter, so long as an\r\nacquaintance is formed only with the exterior of its volumes. And, in\r\nlike manner, Genealogy appears under a very different aspect to those\r\nwho know it only by name, and to lovers of Biography and History who are\r\nfamiliar with its lucid and yet ever suggestive guidance. Without\r\nwritten Genealogies, who can clearly understand the political and\r\nhistorical position of the rival Princes of the red and white Roses; or\r\nof HENRY VII. and the \"last of the Plantagenets\"; or of Queens ELIZABETH\r\nTUDOR, MARY STUART, and JANE GREY? Or who, without similar aid, will\r\nfollow out the fortunes of the Houses of BEAUCHAMP and NEVILLE and\r\nDUDLEY, and connect them with the existing noble lord of Warwick Castle;\r\nor, when reading of the DE CLARES, the BOHUNS, or the PERCIES, will see\r\nat a glance the connection between \"STRONGBOW\" and the \"red Earl\r\nGILBERT,\" or will understand the significance of the white swan Badge of\r\nthe STAFFORDS, or will read at sight the quartered Shield of the Duke of\r\nNORTHUMBERLAND, of to-day, and will discern the line that connects the\r\nliving Earl PERCY with the \"HOTSPUR\" whose fame was two centuries old\r\nwhen SHAKESPEARE wrote of him? And further, who, that is unable to\r\naccomplish such things as these, can appreciate History, can enjoy it\r\nand apply its lessons aright?\r\n\r\nIn arranging a Genealogy the utmost conciseness is essential, all\r\ndetails being left for full description elsewhere. All the members of\r\nthe same family are placed side by side, on the same level, in their\r\norder of seniority; and all are connected by lines with one another and\r\nwith their parents. Successive generations also, throughout all the\r\nbranches of any family, or in allied families, have their places on the\r\nsame levels; and the connecting and distinguishing lines are continued\r\nthroughout. Examples of Genealogies treated in the most scientific and\r\nyet simple manner, easy to be understood, and perfect as models for\r\nstudents, may be obtained in any Part of the _Herald and Genealogist_,\r\nformerly edited by the late Mr. J. G. NICHOLS, F.S.A., Parliament\r\nStreet, Westminster. I refer to this excellent Periodical, because it is\r\nnot possible for me here in the space at my disposal to set forth a\r\nreally useful example of a Genealogy: and, I must add, because it is\r\nmost desirable that students of Heraldry should form such an\r\nacquaintance with Mr. Nichols, as may be acquired through his works.\r\n_Miscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica_, now edited by Mr. W. B.\r\nBANNERMAN, is another Periodical, which ought to be in the hands of all\r\nGenealogists.\r\n\r\nIn Genealogies, this mark = denotes alliance by marriage, and it is\r\nplaced between the names of a husband and wife: and the lines that\r\nproceed from this mark, thus,\r\n\r\n             =\r\n             |\r\n    ________/ \\________\r\n   /                   \\\r\n\r\npoint out their issue. The initials S. P. (of the Latin words _Sine\r\nProle_, \"without issue\") show where a line or a branch ceases. Other\r\nabbreviations and signs in general use will suggest their own\r\nsignification.\r\n\r\nAs I began this Chapter with quotations, so with a quotation I conclude\r\nit. \"There are some persons,\" writes Mr. LOWER, in his \"Curiosities of\r\nHeraldry\" (p. 292), \"who cannot discriminate between the taste for\r\npedigree\" (or genealogy) \"and the pride of ancestry. Now these two\r\nfeelings, though they often combine in one individual, have no necessary\r\nconnection with each other. Man is said to be a hunting animal. Some\r\nhunt foxes; others for fame or fortune. Others hunt in the intellectual\r\nfield; some for the arcana of Nature and of mind; some for the roots of\r\nwords, or the origin of things. I am fond of hunting out a pedigree.\"\r\nAnd, gentle reader, when you have joined the chase genealogical,\r\nI promise you, so also will you be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n  _The College of Arms-- The Lyon Office of Scotland-- Grants of Arms--\r\n  Tax on \"Armorial Bearings,\" and on \"Arms Found\"_\r\n\r\n  \"They were conspicuous for judgment, experience, learning, and\r\n  elegance; they gained honour wherever they were employed.\"\r\n   --NOBLE, _History of the College of Arms_.\r\n\r\n  \"What is your Crest and Motto?--Send name and county to ----'s\r\n  Heraldic Office. For plain Sketch, 3s. 6d. In heraldic colours, 6s.\"\r\n    --_Morning Newspapers._\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The HERALDS OF ENGLAND, who before had been attached to the Household\r\neither of the Sovereign or of some Personage of exalted rank, were\r\nincorporated as a Fraternity by RICHARD III., a Prince whose historical\r\nreputation is by no means in harmony with that early act of his reign,\r\nwhich has done such good service to English History--the Foundation and\r\nEstablishment of the COLLEGE OF ARMS, or, as it is commonly called, the\r\nHERALDS' COLLEGE.\r\n\r\nThe Letters Patent, issued for this purpose by RICHARD III., bear date\r\nMarch the 2nd, 1483, the first year of his reign. Very important\r\nprivileges and immunities, with high powers and authority, were granted\r\nto the incorporated Heralds: and the \"right fair and stately house,\"\r\ncalled \"Pulteney's Inn,\" situate in the metropolitan parish of All\r\nSaints, was assigned to them as their permanent official residence. The\r\nCharter granted to the Heralds by the last Plantagenet Sovereign was\r\nconfirmed by his successors.\r\n\r\nThe buildings of the College were destroyed by the great fire of 1666;\r\nbut all the records and documents fortunately escaped, having been\r\nremoved to Whitehall; and the edifice was subsequently rebuilt, chiefly\r\nat the cost of the Heralds themselves, where it now stands between St.\r\nPaul's Cathedral and the Thames. There, in the College of Arms, are\r\nstill carefully preserved all that the early Heralds recorded and\r\ntransmitted to our times. There, not the least valuable of the contents\r\nof the College, an unique Library is in the keeping of Guardians, who\r\nunderstand its true uses, as they appreciate its preciousness. And there\r\nalso the Headquarters of English Heraldry are as duly established, as\r\nthose of the British Army are at the Horse Guards in Whitehall.\r\n\r\nThe great change that has come upon London since the Heralds rebuilt\r\ntheir official home, has already caused some structural alteration in\r\nthe building, and has resulted in the College of Arms now appearing out\r\nof place in its original position in the City. Other changes, which\r\nfollow in such rapid succession in that busy neighbourhood, render it by\r\nno means improbable that the site of their College may be required for\r\nsome great \"City improvement\"; and so the Heralds may be constrained to\r\nestablish themselves in the more congenial regions of the metropolitan\r\n\"far west.\" This, as I am disposed to consider, is one of those\r\nconsummations that are devoutly to be desired.\r\n\r\nThe times have been in which Heraldry could not number amongst its true\r\nfriends the official Heralds of the College of Arms: but, happily,\r\na very different, and in many most important respects a thoroughly\r\nsatisfactory condition of things now obtains at the College. So far as\r\nthe Heralds are concerned, as a body of learned, accomplished, and\r\ncourteous gentlemen, Heraldry now is admirably represented amongst us,\r\nand faithfully supported. What still is deficient in the existing\r\nconstitution of the College of Arms, as a National Institution, is\r\nadaptation to existing circumstances, sentiments, and requirements. It\r\nis but a truism to assert that, as a National Institution, the College\r\nof Arms does not fill its proper position: and, to all who are familiar\r\nwith the facts of the case, it is equally obvious that this is simply\r\nbecause the College does not vindicate its indisputable title to that\r\nposition which really is its own.\r\n\r\nHeraldry is decidedly popular. This popularity also is assuming a more\r\npractical, and at the same time a more enduring form, through gradually\r\nbecoming the result of a correct appreciation of the true character of\r\nHeraldry, and of its intrinsic value. At a time in which people are\r\nbeginning to feel and to admit that they _ought to know_ something about\r\nHeraldry, the College of Arms _ought to take the lead_ in making\r\nHeraldry still better understood, still more justly appreciated, still\r\nmore popular. The time, also, is indeed come in which it is the bounden\r\nduty of the College of Arms to impress upon the community at large, that\r\n_the sole source and fountain-head of authority in all matters armorial,\r\nunder the Sovereign, centres in itself_. This is to be accomplished by\r\nthe same process, and only by the same process, by which the College of\r\nArms may win for itself thorough popularity and universal confidence. If\r\nthe College requires fresh or increased powers, application to that\r\neffect should be made to the Legislature. The Heraldry of Scotland has\r\nbeen dealt with by Parliament: and it would be equally easy to obtain\r\nsuch a statute as would enable English Heraldry to do justice to itself,\r\nwhile fulfilling its own proper duties.\r\n\r\nWithout abating or compromising in the slightest degree its own dignity\r\nor the dignity of Heraldry, the College of Arms requires to be\r\ntransmuted from an exclusive into a popular Institution. It requires,\r\nnot indeed to have its object and aim and system of action changed, but\r\nto have them expanded, and expanded so widely as to comprehend all the\r\nheraldic requirements of the age. This is a subject of too urgent\r\nimportance not to be noticed here; but still, it is not possible to do\r\nmore than to notice it in very general terms.\r\n\r\nUpon one specific point, however, a few plain words may be spoken\r\nwithout hesitation, and may be left by themselves without comment. The\r\nFees and Charges of all kinds for granting, matriculating, confirming,\r\nand recording the rightful possession of armorial Insignia must be\r\narranged upon a perfectly fresh system, with such provisions and\r\nmodifications as may adapt them to every variety of circumstance and of\r\nrequirement. This is a question which can be regarded only from one\r\npoint of view by every true lover of Heraldry, and consequently by every\r\ntrue friend of the College of Arms.\r\n\r\nII. The National Heraldic body in Scotland, entitled the LYON OFFICE, is\r\nunder the presidency of the _Lyon King of Arms_. The Chief of the\r\nScottish official Heralds from May 1796 to a recent period had been a\r\nPeer of that realm; and the duties of the office, accordingly, had been\r\ndischarged for seventy years by a _Lyon Depute_. But, on the death of\r\nthe Earl of KINNOUL, in February 1866, it was determined to remodel in\r\nsome respects the arrangements of the Lyon Office; and Mr. GEORGE\r\nBURNETT, who had long been \"Lyon Depute,\" was appointed by Her Majesty\r\nto be \"Lyon King.\" He has been succeeded by Sir J. BALFOUR PAUL. The\r\nArms of the Lyon Office I have already given, No. 266.\r\n\r\nThe action of the Scottish Lyon King of Arms, and of the Institution\r\nover which he presides, after having degenerated from the worthy\r\nstandard of earlier days, has revived under far happier conditions, and\r\nwith prospects that are eminently gratifying. It may be fairly expected,\r\nindeed, that the most salutary results will be produced by the very\r\ndecided \"tendency\" that for some time has existed, \"to cultivate the\r\nrules and principles of that earlier age, to which\"--writes Mr.\r\nSeton--\"we are indebted for a system of Scottish Heraldry, whose purity\r\ncertainly has not been surpassed in any other corner of Christendom.\"\r\nThese words occur in a highly interesting memoir of the Lyon Office, in\r\nthe fourth chapter of the work entitled \"The Law and Practice of\r\nHeraldry in Scotland,\" an able and admirable volume, published in 1863\r\nin Edinburgh, which shows the growing popularity of a true Heraldry\r\nnorth of the Tweed, and proves that in the author, Mr. Seton, Scottish\r\nHeraldry possesses an advocate no less powerful than zealous and\r\njudicious.\r\n\r\nIII. Arms and Armorial Insignia are granted _only_ through the College\r\nof Arms in England, and through the Lyon Office in Scotland, in both\r\nrealms with the direct sanction of the Crown expressed in England by the\r\nEarl Marshal. In Ireland all Grants are made by Ulster King of Arms with\r\nthe same sanction.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed and kept in remembrance that the _sole right_ to\r\nArms is a Grant from the College or the Crown, or Inheritance by lineal\r\ndescent from an ancestor to whom a Grant was made or in whom a right to\r\nbear Arms has been officially recognised and registered by the Crown.\r\n\r\nAll \"Grants\" and \"Confirmations of Arms\" (Confirmations, that is, of the\r\nClaims of certain individuals to bear certain Arms, by some uncertain\r\nright and title duly set forth and approved and thereafter legalised by\r\nthe Crown) are formally and regularly recorded, with a full blazon of\r\nthe insignia, at the College or Offices of Arms.\r\n\r\nIt is very greatly to be desired that, in addition to this time-honoured\r\nusage of the Heralds in making these records, some simple plan could be\r\nadopted for the periodical registration at the College of Arms of all\r\narmorial insignia that are borne by right. Almost equally desirable,\r\nalso, it would be to make a corresponding registration, as far as might\r\nbe possible, of whatever insignia are borne _without_ any right. The\r\ncontents of both registers would form unquestionably useful publications\r\nof a periodical character. In connection with any such project as I have\r\njust suggested, it appears to me that good service might be rendered to\r\nthe cause of true Heraldry amongst us, if _Badges and Mottoes_ (without\r\nany other insignia whatever) were formally granted by the College, under\r\ncertain conditions, and at the cost of a small Fee.[9]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: I leave this sentence as it has hitherto stood in the\r\n    book. Badges are now granted and recorded, but a prior right to arms\r\n    is required. --A. C. F.-D. 1908.]\r\n\r\nIn new Grants of Arms, as in so many formal documents, something of the\r\nearly form of Expression, with some traces of its piquant quaintness,\r\nare still retained. Very quaint indeed, and very extravagant also, is\r\nthe style that was generally adopted by the Heralds of the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries, and yet characteristic of both the men and their\r\ntimes. As an example of one of these old documents, an example of no\r\ncommon interest in itself, I now give the Grant of Arms to JOHN\r\nSHAKESPERE, the Poet's father, in the year 1596. Two draft copies of the\r\noriginal Grant are preserved in the College of Arms; the following\r\ntranscript is printed from the later of the two copies, the earlier\r\nhaving been used to supply any word or passage that now is wanting in\r\nthe other. The insertions thus obtained are printed in brackets.\r\n\r\n  [Transcriber's Note:\r\n  All brackets except footnote references are in the original.

Wherefore being solicited and by\r\n  credible report informed that John Shakespeare of Stratford uppon\r\n  Avon in the counte of Warwik, whose parentes and late\r\n  antecessors[10] were for theyre faithefull and va[leant service\r\n  advaunced and rewarded by the most prudent] prince King Henry the\r\n  Seventh of [famous memorie, sythence which tyme they have\r\n  continewed at] those partes, being of good reputacion [and credit;\r\n  and that the] said John hathe maryed [Mary, daughter and one of\r\n  the heyrs of Robert Arden, of Wilmcote, in the said] counte,\r\n  esquire.[11] In consideration whereof, and for the encouragement\r\n  of his posterite, to whom such Blazon [or Atchevement] by the\r\n  auncyent custome of the lawes of armes maie descend, I the said\r\n  Garter King of Armes have assigned, graunted and by these\r\n  presentes confirmed this shield or cote of arms, viz.

The interest inseparable from this Grant\r\nis enhanced in no slight degree by the strong probability that John\r\nShakespere made his application to the College of Arms by the advice and\r\nin consequence of the request of his son. Had the worthy Garter been\r\nable to divine the \"dignities and desertes\" of the son, he might\r\npossibly have employed formal language of a still more complimentary\r\ncharacter, when drawing up a Grant of Arms for the father.\r\n\r\nA much more curious specimen of the heraldic style and form of\r\nexpression (and also of the spelling) of the earlier days of the Queen\r\nELIZABETH era, is a Grant of Augmentation and Crest, by LAWRENCE DALTON,\r\nNorroy King of Arms, to JOHN BENNETT, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, Gentleman,\r\nA.D. 1560. The Preamble to this Grant, which is printed in full in\r\n_Miscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica_ (p. 48), is thus written:--\r\n\r\n  To All and Singuler as well nobles and gentles as kings herauldes\r\n  and officers of Armes as others w{ch} thes presentes shall see\r\n  Reade or heare Lawrence Dalton Esquire Al's Norrey Kinge of Armes\r\n  of thest and west p'tyes of Englande fro the Ryver of trent\r\n  northwarde Sendythe Due and humble comendacons and greatinge\r\n  fforasmuche as awncyentlye fro the begynnynge and not w{th}owt\r\n  great Delyberacon Equitie and Reason hyt hathe byn by the moste\r\n  noble and famous princes Constytutyd and ordeynyd that men of\r\n  wysdom knoledge vertue and of noble lyefe and Coorage haue byn\r\n  notoryowslye commendyd to the Woorlde w{th} Sonndrye monumentes\r\n  and Remembrances w{th} tokens of honnor for A testamonye of\r\n  theyre good Desertes As Amonge the Romayns y{e} Erecc'on of\r\n  Statues and Images w{th} tytles and Appellac'ons of honnour And\r\n  of more latre Dayes w{th} the moste p'te of nac'ons bearinge of\r\n  Signes and tokens in Shyldes callyd Armes w{ch} be the\r\n  Demonstrac'ons and Evidences of noblenes vertue and woorthynes\r\n  that to eu'ry man accordinge to theyre Desertes be Dyu'slye\r\n  Dystrybutyd Wherby such signes and tokens of the woorthye and\r\n  cooragyous might appeare before the cowarde vnwoorthye and\r\n  Ignorant Even so yt ys yet obs'vyd that suche w{ch} have merytyd\r\n  or donne com'endable s'vice to theyre prince or countrye or by\r\n  theyre woorthye and Lawdable lyefe Do Daylye encrease in vertue\r\n  wysdom and knowledge shulde not be forgoten and so put in oblyvyon\r\n  but rewardyd w{th} som token of honnor for the same the Rather to\r\n  move and styrre other to the Imytac'on of lyke noblenes vertue and\r\n  woorthynes ffor w{ch} purpose hyt was not therefor w{th}owt\r\n  great provydence ordeynyd and yet ys that there Shulde be officers\r\n  and herauldes of Armes to whose office hyt shulde be appropryate\r\n  to kepe in Regestre tharmes pedegrees and Descentes of nobles and\r\n  gentles w{th} theyre woorthye and valyant actes and to have power\r\n  and awethorytye to allowe and Ratefye vnto the woorthye Som\r\n  awgmentac'on token or Remembrance of noblenes for theyre seyde\r\n  woorthynes And now beinge Desyryd--\r\n\r\nAnd so forth, worthy Mr. Norroy having forgotten such \"signes and\r\ntokens\" as stops, while carefully showing what style and form it is\r\n_not_ desirable for us to adopt, however excellent may be his system of\r\nbuilding up honourable insignia upon a foundation of nobleness, virtue,\r\nand worthiness.\r\n\r\nI add one other early document of another kind, which is an excellent\r\nmodel for present use by the Heralds of our own days, the orthography\r\nhaving by them been duly corrected.\r\n\r\n  EXAMPLE OF A CONFIRMATION OR RECORD OF ARMS:-- Theis are the\r\n  anncient Armes and Creast, belonging to the name and famely of\r\n  LEECHFORDE in the County of Surrey, descended from the LEECHFORDS\r\n  in Buckinghamsheire. Which at the request of S{R} RICHARD\r\n  LEECHFORDE of Shelwood in the County of Surrey Knight, I WILL'M\r\n  SEGAR Garter, Principall King of Armes have blasoned, and sett\r\n  forth in coullors, according as they are here depicted in the\r\n  margent. Viz.\" (here follows a written blazon).... \"Testifying\r\n  hereby the saide armoryes to belong vnto the saide S{R} RICHARD\r\n  LEECHFORD and to his yssue, to vse, beare, and shewe forth at all\r\n  tymes, and in all places, at their free lib'ty and pleasure. In\r\n  Witnes wherof....\r\n\r\n&c. &c., with Seal and Signature, and the Date 3rd of JAMES I.\r\n\r\nI presume that an argument in support of the abolition of all Taxation\r\nof \"Armorial Bearings,\" on the plea of the utter absurdity of a tax upon\r\nan honourable distinction, would be met with the reply that \"Armorial\r\nBearings\" are taxed purely as \"luxuries,\" and without the slightest\r\nreference to their intrinsic character. If the validity of this plea\r\nmust be admitted, still this tax might be levied with what may be styled\r\na becoming heraldic discrimination.\r\n\r\nFor example:--Arms distinguished by \"Augmentations of Honour\" might be\r\naltogether exempted; a higher rate might be fixed in the case of Arms\r\nthat are ensigned with Coronets, and that display Supporters. Arms borne\r\nby unquestionable right, and which are duly recorded at the College,\r\nmight be rated at a comparatively low charge, certainly not to exceed\r\nfive shillings a year. On the other hand, all Arms or armorial insignia\r\nborne with a very questionable right, or without even the pretence of\r\nany right whatever, might be subjected to the ordinary tax for \"Armorial\r\nBearings\" of their class multiplied (according to circumstances) by\r\nfour, six, or ten.\r\n\r\nThe tax estimated by the aid of the multiplication-table, that has just\r\nbeen suggested, would extend, under a special schedule possessing a high\r\nmultiplying power, to any self-constituted \"Establishment\" or \"Office,\"\r\nwhich, powerless to \"grant\" Arms, undertakes--in consideration of a very\r\ntrifling fee--to \"find,\" and either to \"sketch\" or to \"colour\" them.\r\nExceedingly simple is the process, by means of which this undertaking is\r\naccomplished. It consists in consulting a printed Armory; and, when the\r\ndesired \"Arms\" have been \"found\" in its well-stored columns, they then\r\nat once are assigned to the applicant, in conformity with the\r\ncomprehensive and beautifully simple theory, that all persons having the\r\nsame surname and who also live (or were born) in the same county are\r\nequally entitled to bear the same Arms. Probably it does not occur to\r\nthe patrons of advertising Heraldry-dealers, that upon precisely the\r\nsame principle every person who has the same \"name and county\" with any\r\nofficer who may be \"found\" in the Navy or the Army List, might assert a\r\nright to whatever rank and title such an officer may enjoy by virtue of\r\nhis commission.\r\n\r\nThe almost universal desire to possess some kind of armorial insignia,\r\nimplies a corresponding recognition of the necessity to obtain them from\r\nsome Institution or Personage, supposed to be competent and authorised\r\nboth to determine what they should be, and to impart a right to accept\r\nand to assume and bear them. It rests with the Heralds of the College of\r\nArms to take the initiative in a course of action, which would direct\r\nall aspirants for heraldic distinctions, as a matter of course, to their\r\nown doors. The Heralds, who really are Heralds, and who alone are real\r\nHeralds, may rely on the support of Public Opinion. If a fictitious\r\nHeraldry is not only prevalent, but in some sense actually in the\r\nascendant, it is not because the counterfeit is preferred to the\r\ngenuine, but because it is unconsciously mistaken for it. In very many\r\ninstances, indeed, a determination to obtain \"Arms\" is coupled with an\r\nignorance of Heraldry so complete, as to ignore the existence of any\r\nsuch thing as a Heraldry that is fictitious.\r\n\r\nA popular College of Arms, without any serious difficulty, might\r\nestablish its own authority with all classes of the community; and, at\r\nthe same time, it would not fail to impress upon the public mind the\r\nvery decided difference that exists between the heraldic and the\r\nnon-heraldic acceptation of the expression--\"_an escutcheon of\r\npretence_.\" Much real good would certainly result from the rude shock\r\nthat would be given to many a complacent display of armorial insignia,\r\nby showing the proud blazonry to be _abated_ with the baton sinister of\r\nheraldic untruth and unwarrantable assumption. And better still it would\r\nbe to show to all who possess, or who desire to possess and to bear\r\n\"Arms,\" that the \"Pride of Heraldry\" is a worthy and a noble pride,\r\nbecause it is the Pride of Truth and Right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n  _MISCELLANEOUS:-- Coins-- Seals-- Heraldry in Architecture; in\r\n  Monuments; in Illuminations; in Encaustic Tiles-- Heraldic Personal\r\n  Ornaments, and various Heraldic Decorations-- Conclusion._\r\n\r\n  \"The Spandrels over the Wall-arcading are exquisitely beautiful...\r\n  Those in the western arm contained Shields of a large number of the\r\n  great men of the day ... the few which remain are nobly executed.\"\r\n    --GLEANINGS FROM WESTMINSTER ABBEY, by G. G. Scott, R.A.:\r\n    2nd Edition, p. 33.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The HERALDRY OF THE COINAGE, in addition to the Shields of Arms of\r\nsuccessive Sovereigns, exemplifies the changes that have taken place in\r\nthe form and adornment of the Crown, and it also is rich in various\r\nBadges and Devices having an historical significance.\r\n\r\nIn Coins the Royal Shield is sometimes quartered by a cross charged upon\r\nit, as in the silver penny of EDWARD VI. A mediæval ship, having a sail\r\ncovered with heraldic blazonry, appears on the _Noble_--a coin worthy of\r\nits name. A figure of the King in armour (not particularly well\r\nproportioned to the size of the vessel), his sword in one hand, and his\r\nShield of arms in the other, is also represented in these fine examples\r\nof mediæval numismatic art. A ship without any sail, but in its stead\r\ncharged with the Royal Shield heightened by a Cross, forms the reverse\r\nof another excellent coin, the _Angel_, the obverse bearing a figure of\r\nST. MICHAEL with his lance thrusting down the dragon. The Angel of\r\nEDWARD IV. on either side of the Cross has the initial E and the white\r\nrose of York; and the legend is-- PER : CRVCEM : TVA : SALVA : NOS :\r\nXTE : REDEMPT : (\"By thy Cross save us, O Redeemer Christ!\"). A Crowned\r\nRose, with a Royal Cypher, is another favourite device; as in the\r\nShilling of Henry VIII., with the legend-- POSVI : DEV : ADIVTOREM :\r\nMEVM : (\"I have placed God (before me as) my helper\").\r\n\r\nSuch are a few examples of the early Heraldry of English Coins. More\r\nrecently, and particularly in our own Coinage, Heraldry and Art have\r\ndeclined together, so that feeble designs, but too commonly executed\r\nwith lamentable consistency, are associated with heraldic inaccuracies\r\nwhich continue uncorrected to this day--witness the _tressure of\r\nScotland_ often incorrectly blazoned on the Royal Shield; and poor\r\nBRITANNIA, in her old position, sitting forlorn on the copper and bronze\r\ncoinage, as if conscious of being constrained to display on her oval\r\nShield an obsolete blazonry, that placed the reign of Queen VICTORIA in\r\nthe eighteenth century![12]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: The specimens of the existing Coinage of Europe,\r\n    displayed at the Universal Exposition, at Paris, showed that if the\r\n    art of the English Mint is now at a low ebb, the prevailing standard\r\n    of numismatic art is not a single degree higher, the coins of France\r\n    alone being in many respects an honourable exception to the general\r\n    rule.]\r\n\r\nII. To what has been already said on the value of heraldic SEALS I\r\ndesire here to add a few words, in the hope of inducing all students of\r\nHeraldry to study them with the most diligent care.\r\n\r\nCasts of fine impressions are not difficult to obtain. Almost every\r\naccessible fine Seal has been copied by Mr. Ready, of the British\r\nMuseum, who supplies admirable casts at a very moderate cost. The\r\nScottish Seals of the late Mr. H. Laing, of Edinburgh, were purchased on\r\nhis decease by the authorities of the British Museum. The most\r\nsatisfactory casts are made in gutta-percha, which may be gilt by simply\r\nrubbing a gold powder with a soft brush upon them, after slightly\r\nwarming their surfaces. Moulds for reproducing casts or impressions may\r\nbe made in gutta-percha; and from these moulds casts, also in\r\ngutta-percha, may be obtained. The process is very simple: the\r\ngutta-percha, softened by immersion in hot water, is pressed upon an\r\nimpression in relief, until a perfect intaglio is formed. When this\r\nmould is cold and hard, it will stamp an impression upon gutta-percha\r\nsoftened in the same manner.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 442.--Seal of Lord Bardolf.]\r\n\r\nI add to the examples of fine heraldic Seals that I have already given,\r\nthe richly traceried Seal bearing the armorial Shield of JOHN, Lord\r\nBARDOLF, of Wormegay in Norfolk, about A.D. 1350; No. 442. This most\r\nbeautiful Seal, which in the original in diameter is only one and\r\none-sixth inches, has been somewhat enlarged in the engraving, in order\r\nto show the design more plainly. The arms of BARDOLF are--_Az., three\r\ncinquefoils or_.\r\n\r\nThe liberality and kindness of Mr. Laing enable me to associate with the\r\nSeal of Lord BARDOLF a small group of additional examples of Scottish\r\nSeals: two of them are good illustrations as well of English as of\r\nScottish Heraldry, and they exemplify the usage of introducing Gothic\r\ntraceries into the composition of Seals with Shields of Arms: in both\r\nthese examples, however, the leading outlines only of the traceries\r\nremain, and the rich cusping (which is so perfect in the Seal of Lord\r\nBARDOLF) is lost. No. 443, the Seal of WILLIAM MURE, A.D. 1397, has a\r\nShield bearing--_Arg., on a fesse az. three mullets of the field_. No.\r\n444, the Seal of THOMAS MONYPENY, A.D. 1415, has the Shield _couchée_\r\ncharged with _Az., a chevron between three crosses crosslets fitchée\r\nissuing from as many crescents arg._: the Crest, on a helm, is a bird,\r\nprobably a popinjay or parrot. The Seal of RICHARD STUART, No. 445,\r\nprobably about 1350, may be compared with No. 414, p. 249: in the\r\nsmaller and earlier example, the solitary individual who represents the\r\ncrew may be assumed to be Richard Stuart himself; his vessel displays\r\ntwo banners which are evidently affected by contrary currents of air,\r\nand a pennon.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 443.--Seal of William Mure.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 444.--Seal of Thomas Monypeny.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 445.--Seal of Richard Stuart.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 447.--Counter Seal of Earl Thomas de Beauchamp,\r\n  A.D. 1344]\r\n\r\nThe noble Seal, No. 446 (_see_ Frontispiece), engraved from a most\r\nperfect impression recently discovered appended to a document in the\r\nguardianship of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, represents its\r\nillustrious owner, THOMAS DE BEAUCHAMP, K.G., third Earl of WARWICK, in\r\narmour, with his shield and jupon charged with the armorial insignia of\r\nBeauchamp (_gu., a fesse between six crosses crosslets or_), and with\r\nthe same insignia repeated upon the bardings of the charger upon which\r\nthe Earl is mounted. The engraving of the Seal itself appears on the\r\nFrontispiece to this Volume: and the Counter-Seal, one of the most\r\nbeautiful and most perfect examples in existence of the early\r\nseal-engraver's art, is here represented in No. 447. The Shield\r\ndisplayed on this Counter-Seal is charged only with the Arms of the\r\nNEWBURGHS (_chequée or and az., a chevron erm._), from whom the Earldom\r\nof Warwick passed by inheritance to the House of Beauchamp. The\r\ninscription is commenced on the Seal, No. 446, and continued on the\r\nCounter-Seal, No. 447, and is as follows:-- S : THOE : COMITIS :\r\nWARRWYCHIE : ANNO : REGNI : REGIS : E : T'CII : POST : CÕQVEST[Vm] :\r\nANGLIE : SEPTIO : DECIO : ET : REGNI : SVI : FRANCIE : QVARTO--\r\n\"The Seal of Thomas, Earl of Warwick, in the seventeenth year of the\r\nreign of King Edward III. (of that name) after the Conquest of England,\r\nand the fourth of his reign over France.\" Thus, the date of the\r\nexecution of this fine Seal is the year 1344. The Earl himself died\r\nin 1369.\r\n\r\nA second Beauchamp Seal is also represented in the Frontispiece. This is\r\nthe Seal of RICHARD DE BEAUCHAMP, K.G., fifth Earl of WARWICK, who died\r\nin the year 1439. The Heraldry in this example is particularly\r\ninteresting. The Shield, charged with _Newburgh_ and _Beauchamp_\r\nquarterly, is couchée from the helm of the Earl which is ensigned with\r\nhis coronet and crest; and on either side is _a bear with a ragged\r\nstaff_, the famous Badges of the BEAUCHAMPS: No. 448 (_see_\r\nFrontispiece). The Inscription is-- SIGILL : RIC : DE : BELLO : CAMPO :\r\nCOMIT : WARWICH-- \"The Seal of Richard de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick\"\r\n(see pages 223 and 224).\r\n\r\nIII. In GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE Heraldry is always a consistent, beautiful,\r\nand most effective accessory. Indeed, so thoroughly is the spirit of\r\nHeraldry in harmony with the great Architecture which grew up in the\r\nMiddle Ages, that Heraldry must be considered rather as an element of\r\nits nature than as an allied Art. Gothic Architecture is essentially\r\nheraldic; and hence, as well as from its elastic nature and its equally\r\nconsistent and happy applicability to every use and requirement, it is\r\npeculiarly appropriate as our own national style.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest years of its existence as a definite Science, Heraldry\r\nis found to be most intimately associated with the Gothic Architecture\r\nof England: and happy it was for the early Heralds, that in their days\r\nthe English Gothic was at work in the full strength of its first\r\nmaturity. And this alliance was never interrupted, or permitted to\r\ndecline from its original cordiality. As long as the Gothic flourished,\r\nHeraldry held its own place in Architecture. And in the finest works\r\nthat exist amongst us, relics of the grand Gothic Ages of English\r\nArchitecture, Heraldry is ever present to adorn them with its graphic\r\nrecords. In the spandrels of arcades, in panels, upon bosses in\r\nvaulting, in stained glass, in encaustic floor-tiles, and indeed in\r\nalmost every position in which such ornamentation could be admissible,\r\nthe early Herald is found to have been the fellow-worker with the early\r\nGothic architect. Gothic Architecture, accordingly, has preserved for us\r\nvery noble collections and specimens of the most valuable illustrations\r\nof our national Heraldry. Canterbury and York Cathedrals, and the Abbey\r\nChurches of Westminster and St. Alban's, with the Chapel of King's\r\nCollege, Cambridge, are especially rich in heraldic treasures: and\r\nWestminster Hall and the northern Castles of Alnwick and Warkworth may\r\nbe specified as noble examples of secular Architecture, which retain\r\ntheir heraldic enrichments.\r\n\r\nIV. Gothic MONUMENTS, and in common with them their successors of the\r\nRenaissance era, abound in every variety of armorial blazonry. And fine\r\nexamples of heraldic Monuments are no less abundant, than are the\r\nShields and other insignia that appear on particular memorials. The\r\nprinciples which directed the selection of Shields to be introduced into\r\nthe composition of early Monuments are worthy of careful consideration:\r\nand the same remark is no less applicable in the case of Architecture.\r\nI must be content to specify a very small group of heraldic Monuments of\r\nespecial interest and value. In Westminster Abbey: the Monuments of\r\nQueens ALIANORE of Castile, PHILIPPA of Hainault, ELIZABETH TUDOR, and\r\nMARY STUART; the Monuments of King EDWARD III. and King HENRY VII.; and\r\nthose of ALIANORE DE BOHUN, Duchess of GLOUCESTER, the Countess of\r\nLENNOX, the Countess of DERBY, the two DE VALENCES, Earls of Pembroke,\r\nEDMUND, Earl of Lancaster, Lord BOURCHIER, and Sir GILES DAUBENEY, K.G.\r\nIn Canterbury Cathedral: the Monuments of the BLACK PRINCE, and of\r\nHENRY IV. and JOANNA of Navarre. In Salisbury Cathedral: the Monument of\r\nEarl WILLIAM LONGESPÉE. In St. Alban's Abbey Church: the Monuments of\r\nHUMPHREY, Duke of GLOUCESTER, and of the Abbots WHEATHAMSTEDE and\r\nRAMRYGE. Also, other fine Monuments in the Churches at Elsyng in\r\nNorfolk, Ewelme and Northleigh in Oxfordshire, King's Langley in\r\nHertfordshire, and Cobham in Kent; in Beverley Minster, and in the\r\nBeauchamp Chapel at Warwick.\r\n\r\nV. In the ILLUMINATIONS of the Middle Ages Heraldry has a place of\r\nhonour: and in the revival of that early Art, which is held in such high\r\nestimation at the present day, Heraldry ought to occupy a position of\r\ncorresponding prominence. This implies in the Illuminators of to-day\r\nsome knowledge of Heraldry, and at least some degree of familiarity with\r\ngood early examples. I venture to suggest, therefore, to students of\r\nIllumination the study both of the Herald's Art and his Science, as no\r\nunimportant part of their preparation for the practice of the Art of\r\nIllumination on the principle of the sagacious maxim of a great modern\r\npainter, quoted by Mr. RUSKIN in his \"Seven Lamps of\r\nArchitecture\"--\"Know what you have to do, and _then_ do it.\"\r\n\r\nVI. In the ornamentation of early ENCAUSTIC or INLAID PAVEMENT TILES,\r\nShields of Arms and various heraldic devices frequently occur: and in\r\nmany examples the Shields of Arms are arranged with much skill and in\r\nexcellent taste, to form decorative compositions in combination with\r\nfoliage and traceries. Numerous heraldic Tiles of a very interesting\r\ncharacter remain in the Cathedrals of Worcester, Gloucester, and Exeter;\r\nand in the Churches of Great Malvern, King's Langley, the Abbey Church\r\nof St. Alban, and many others. The student will observe that the devices\r\nupon these Tiles are frequently _reversed_, evidently the result of the\r\nneglect to reverse the designs upon the original dies or stamps.\r\n\r\nVII. Heraldic blazonry was highly esteemed in the Middle Ages as a\r\nbecoming decoration for PERSONAL COSTUME. The Knights wore their _Coats\r\nof Arms_, and they carried and used their _Shields of Arms_, and their\r\narmorial insignia were displayed upon their weapons and upon the various\r\naccessories of their personal equipment. The Ladies adapted this usage\r\nto their own Costume, and they also wore _Mantles and Dresses of Arms_;\r\nand many of their personal ornaments were strictly heraldic. Without\r\neven suggesting now to our Ladies any revival of heraldic costume,\r\nproperly so called--such as dresses, mantles, or shawls emblazoned with\r\nthe bearings of armorial shields--I certainly do desire to see Heraldry\r\nexercising a powerful influence in all designs for personal ornaments,\r\nthe works of the goldsmith and the jeweller more especially. Badges also\r\nmay supply the motive for designing many patterns that are to adorn\r\nfabrics used for costume: and, in like manner also, the designs woven\r\ninto carpets, curtains, and various other fabrics may be derived with\r\nthe greatest advantage from the same source. The loom is employed in\r\nblazoning heraldic insignia in white damask: why should it not work,\r\nunder judicious and cautious guidance, in silk and velvet, in satin and\r\nevery woollen fabric?[13]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: I have lately seen a design for the embroidery of a\r\n    dress for a young lady of the Clan CAMPBELL; its characteristic\r\n    features are the Scottish Thistle and the Myrtle, the latter the\r\n    Badge of the Campbells. I may express my approval of the motive of\r\n    this design: others, as I have reason to believe, have approved the\r\n    treatment of it.]\r\n\r\nIt must be understood, however, that heraldic ornaments and devices,\r\nunless they be of such a character that they are universally applicable,\r\nmust have a reference to the wearer, or they degenerate at once into\r\nheraldic parodies. Personal ornaments, costume, furniture, if heraldic,\r\nmust display devices that have a significance as well as a beauty: such\r\ncostume and ornaments must be, not \"becoming\" only to the wearer, but\r\n(in the heraldic acceptation of that term) \"belonging\" also. And so in\r\nevery instance.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of universal decoration and adornment, Heraldry is no less\r\napplicable now than when EDWARD III. or HENRY IV. reigned in England.\r\nHappily, a taste for furniture and all the appliances of every-day life\r\nin the Gothic style is gradually becoming prevalent; and this is\r\ninseparable from the use of Heraldry for the purposes of ornamentation.\r\nI presume that the fallacy of regarding the Gothic style of Art as\r\nexclusively ecclesiastical in its associations and uses, or as no less\r\nnecessarily inseparable from mediæval sentiments and general usages, is\r\nbeginning to give way to more correct views, as the true nature of the\r\nGothic and its original universal employment are better understood.\r\nI consider it to be unnecessary for me, therefore, to enter here, in\r\nsupport of my own sentiments, into any detailed explanations to show\r\nthat the revival of a Style of Art which flourished in bygone ages, and\r\nwith it the revival of Heraldry as it was invented and grew into its\r\nearly dignity and popularity, are in no way or degree whatever connected\r\nwith an implied return to the mode of life of four, five, or six\r\ncenturies ago. We have used Roman and even what we intended to be Greek\r\nArchitecture in nineteenth-century England; we are still in the habitual\r\nuse of Roman and Greek designs for every variety of decoration; and of\r\nlate we have added Egyptian and Scandinavian works of Art to the\r\ndeservedly prized collections of models, that we have formed for the\r\nexpress purpose of imitating them: and yet we do not consider that we\r\nthus in any way bind ourselves to adopt Roman, or Greek, or Egyptian, or\r\nScandinavian costumes or customs; nor in our use of the Arts of\r\nAntiquity do we perceive any demonstration of retrogression in\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with Mediæval Heraldry and Gothic Art. We may apply to\r\nour own times, our own uses, our own delight, what the old Heralds and\r\nthe Gothic Artists have taught us, without even dreaming of wearing\r\narmour or re-establishing the feudal system. True Heraldry (for it is\r\nwith Heraldry that I am now more especially concerned) is a Science, and\r\nit also is an Art, for all time--for our times, and for future times, as\r\nwell as for the times that are past. If we understand and appreciate it,\r\nwe shall not fail to use and to apply it aright.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 449.--Seal of Sir WALTER SCOTT,\r\n  of Branxholm and Kirkurd, A.D. 1529. (Laing).]\r\n\r\nFrom the initial-letter of my first Chapter I suspended the Shield borne\r\nby that Sir WALTER SCOTT, of Abbotsford, whose name will ever be a\r\nhousehold word with every lover of what is chivalrous and knightly. Here\r\nI place the Seal, No. 449, of an earlier Sir WALTER SCOTT, of Branxholm\r\nand Kirkurd--a Knight of another branch of the same distinguished House,\r\nwho differenced the Shield of Scott so as to bear--_Or, on a bend azure\r\na mullet and two crescents gold_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nPEERAGE DIGNITIES\r\n\r\n  _The Dignity of Earl-- Of Baron-- The Parliament of 1295-- Landed\r\n  Qualifications-- Creation of the Title Duke of Cornwall-- The Title of\r\n  Marquis-- The Premier Baron of England-- The Peerage of Scotland--\r\n  Scottish remainders-- Daughter Inherits in her own right--\r\n  Determination of an Abeyance-- The Right to Create Peers of Ireland--\r\n  Rights and Privileges of a Peeress-- The Daughters of Peers--\r\n  Anomalies of the English Scale of Precedence._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the name of the dignity of Earl is derived from a Saxon word,\r\nthe dignity itself, like all others, is more Norman than Saxon in its\r\ncharacter. At the period of the Conquest, and whilst the Norman dynasty\r\nwas on the throne, there were a number of people who bore this title. At\r\nthat time and for long afterwards, certainly well into the Plantagenet\r\nperiod, an Earl within his earldom was little short of a petty\r\nsovereign. Issues of justice and many other rights of regality were in\r\nhis hands, and he occupied a position very much akin to a viceroy for\r\nthe King, seeing that what he did he did in his own name and as Earl, or\r\n\"comes,\" of the County. The High Sheriff was the \"vice-comes.\" Some of\r\nthe earldoms had more extensive rights of regality than others, some\r\nwere actual palatinates, and all earldoms originally were honours in fee\r\nheritable by the heir-general. Earldoms had a territorial nature, and\r\nthe Earl took his \"third penny\" in the issues of the Courts in his\r\nearldom.\r\n\r\nThe only other dignity at that period was that of Baron, and just as the\r\nEarls of to-day have little in common save dignity and title with the\r\nEarls of the past, so the Barons originally were very unlike the latest\r\ncreations of modern Prime Ministers in the name of the King. At the\r\nNorman Conquest, and for long afterwards, the Barons, an indeterminate\r\nnumber, were those who held their land in barony.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of much uncertainty at what date Parliament came into\r\nbeing. The word goes back to a much earlier period, and is used\r\nconcerning a variety of meetings which are now generally regarded as\r\nmeetings of different Councils and not of Parliament, but historians are\r\nagreed that whether or not any earlier meetings can be properly\r\ndescribed as Parliaments, the Parliament of 1295 was properly and fully\r\nconstituted in all its elements. To this Parliament all those who were\r\npersonally summoned by the King in their own names and were not\r\nnominated or elected by other people are Peers, and of these Peers those\r\nwho are not described as Earls are Barons. It should, however, be noted\r\nthat Bishops and Abbots were summoned by right of the offices they held,\r\nand there are certain other officials who were summoned also because of\r\ntheir offices and could be distinguished from the Barons and Earls.\r\nThere is no shadow of doubt that the reason for the summoning of the\r\nBarons was the fact that they were great subjects and important because\r\nof their ownership of land. It was landowners who had to provide the\r\nmilitary services for the country, and Parliament was chiefly concerned,\r\nnot in law-making, but in authorising and consulting as to military\r\nexpeditions, or in providing the subsidies necessary for these\r\nexpeditions, and the other services of the Crown. In addition to this\r\nPeers exercised some of the judicial functions of the Crown. But\r\nlaw-making was done by the King and his Council until a later period.\r\nThe landed qualifications which justified the summoning of a man to\r\nParliament as a Baron usually descended to his heir and similarly\r\njustified the summoning of that heir; and in that way, but without any\r\nintention to that end, the right of summons and the right of peerage\r\nbecame hereditary. Originally it had been arbitrary and at the\r\ndiscretion of the Crown. It was not until the reign of Edward IV. that\r\nthe hereditary peerage character of a barony was fully recognised, and\r\nwith that recognition came the divorce of the territorial idea from the\r\nright of peerage. Like ancient earldoms, ancient baronies were honours\r\nin fee heritable by the heirs general. Save that William the Conqueror\r\nwas Sovereign Lord of the Duchy of Normandy and as such Duke, the\r\ndignity of duke did not exist in England until 1337, when Edward the\r\nBlack Prince was created Duke of Cornwall with remainder to his heirs\r\nthe eldest sons of the Kings of England. That was the creation of the\r\ntitle now enjoyed by the Prince of Wales, but this Duchy of Cornwall and\r\nthe Duchy of Lancaster are really Duchies as distinguished from the\r\nDukedoms enjoyed by other people having the designation of Duke.\r\n\r\nThe title of Marquis dates from 1386, when Richard II. created Robert de\r\nVere Marquis of Dublin; and the title of Viscount from 1440, when the\r\nViscounty of Beaumont was created. The first Barony by Letters Patent\r\nwas created in 1387, but the oldest surviving barony by patent now in\r\nexistence dates from 1448, when Sir John Stourton was created Baron and\r\nLord Stourton of Stourton, co. Wilts. The present Lord Mowbray, Segrave\r\nand Stourton, who has inherited the barony of Stourton, also claims, as\r\nLord Mowbray, to be the premier baron of England although the barony of\r\nMowbray is placed on the roll of precedence after the baronies of Le\r\nDespenser and De Ros. Although earldoms were granted by charters from\r\nthe earliest period, because, attached to the earldom, were also\r\nmaterial rights which needed to be conveyed, patents did not come into\r\nuse for baronies until it was desired to limit the succession of the\r\npeerage to the heirs male of the body of the grantee, which is a\r\nlimitation and a less heirship than is comprised in the enjoyment of an\r\nhonour in fee simple. Privilege of peerage with all it entails has been\r\na slow growth of accretion; and save for place and precedence and the\r\nright of any peer or peeress to be tried in the House of Lords, and the\r\nnow limited and threatened right of peers to legislate, little of\r\nprivilege of peerage remains.\r\n\r\nThe peerage of Scotland is very similar to that of England, and, before\r\nthe Union, the principal difference between the two countries was the\r\npersistency with which the Scottish peerage remained attached to the\r\nland. Until a late date a patent creating a Scottish peerage erected\r\ncertain lands into a barony or earldom as the case might be, and\r\nentailed those lands with the dignity. The difference arising from this\r\nform of procedure was more than counterbalanced by the recognised and\r\nconstantly-adopted procedure of resigning a Scottish inheritance into\r\nthe hands of the Crown, and then obtaining what is known as a\r\n\"Novodamus,\" with either the same or different limitations.\r\n\r\nThe many Scottish remainders, which are quite unknown to English peerage\r\nlaw, are all a consequence of this territorial nature of a Scottish\r\npeerage. One of the chief differences at the present time between an\r\nEnglish and a Scottish peerage is to be found in those which are\r\nheritable by females. Unless governed by special remainder contained in\r\nthe instrument of creation, a Scottish peerage, which in the event of\r\nfailure of a male heir devolves upon a female heir, differs from an\r\nEnglish one in its manner of descent. In Scotland the elder daughter\r\ninherits as of right, standing in the line of heirship next after her\r\nyoungest brother and before any uncle or a younger sister. On the other\r\nhand, such an inheritance is only known by virtue of a special remainder\r\nin England. All Baronies by writ are Baronies in fee in England, and\r\nheritable by the heir general, which means that they can if necessary\r\ndevolve upon females. If the only child of a peer having such a peerage\r\nbe a daughter she inherits in her own right, but if his issue is two\r\ndaughters, then the peerage falls into abeyance between them, because\r\nunder the law of England there is no seniority amongst daughters, and as\r\nboth of them cannot enjoy one single peerage, neither of them has it,\r\nand it remains in abeyance until the Crown interferes or until by the\r\nnatural course of events one line becomes extinguished by the extinction\r\nof all issue of the one daughter, when the peerage then at once devolves\r\nupon the heir of the other. Sometimes an abeyance will last several\r\nhundred years, sometimes it may end with the lapse of one or two; but at\r\nany time during the continuance of an abeyance the Crown may, at its\r\nentire pleasure, signify that any co-heir shall enjoy the peerage. This\r\nis what is termed the determination of an abeyance, and this is effected\r\nby the issue of a writ of summons to Parliament if the co-heir be a male\r\nor by the issue of letters patent in the case of a lady. The co-heir in\r\nwhose favour the abeyance is determined then at once enjoys the peerage\r\nwith the same designation and precedence as those who have held it\r\nhitherto, and his or her heir succeeds in due course.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is one judgment to the contrary, it is now pretty\r\nuniversally admitted that there is no such thing as an Irish Barony by\r\nwrit. With the union of England and Scotland, no further peerages of\r\neither country were created, and subsequent peerages were either of\r\nGreat Britain or of Ireland; and it has been already judicially decided\r\nby the House of Lords that the power to create a Scottish peerage does\r\nnot now exist in the Crown. There is no similar judgment in relation to\r\na peerage of England, but the fact is that no attempt has since been\r\nmade to create one, and though the point up to the present time still\r\nhas to be decided, it is certainly a matter for argument whether or not\r\nsuch a right remains. Since the union of Great Britain with Ireland no\r\nfurther peerages of Great Britain or of England have been created, but\r\nthe right to create peers of Ireland was specifically retained under\r\ncertain conditions and has been constantly taken advantage of. Other\r\npeerages since created have, however, been of the United Kingdom.\r\nWhether or not we shall ever have peerages of the Empire remains a\r\nmatter for the future.\r\n\r\nSince the latter part of the seventeenth century it has been the custom\r\nfor peers and peeresses in their own right to sign simply by the\r\ndesignation of their peerage. The peeress by marriage prefixes her\r\nChristian name or initials to her husband's title. It is statute law in\r\nScotland, but not in England, that no person may sign his surname\r\nwithout prefixing a Christian name or initials. A peeress by marriage\r\nwho is also a peeress in her own right signs first her husband's title,\r\nadding her own afterwards; for instance, the signature of the Countess\r\nof Yarborough is Marcia Yarborough, Fauconberg and Conyers. One cannot\r\ncall to mind in recent times any instances in which the peeress in her\r\nown right has married a peer of lower rank than her own, and until such\r\na case occurs it is difficult to forecast what the signature should be.\r\nA peeress by marriage after re-marriage loses all privilege of peerage\r\nand precedence, and all right which she acquired by marriage, but as a\r\nmatter of courtesy she usually retains her peerage designation if her\r\nsubsequent marriage is to a commoner.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of a peer if married to another peer takes the precedence\r\nof her husband and relinquishes her own, but she retains it if she\r\nmarries a commoner; and one of the anomalies of the English scale of\r\nprecedence is to be found in the following circumstances. If the two\r\nelder daughters of a Duke were to marry an Earl and a Baron\r\nrespectively, whilst the youngest daughter were to run away with the\r\nfootman, she would, nevertheless, rank as the daughter of a Duke above\r\nher sisters ranking as wives of an Earl and a Baron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abated, Abatement, 100, 207\r\n  Abbotsford, 1, 326\r\n  Abased, 100\r\n  Aberdeen, Earl of: Arms, 68\r\n  Abergavenny, Earl of: Arms, 187\r\n  Abeyance, 330, 331\r\n  Accollée, 100\r\n  Accosted, 100\r\n  Accrued, 82\r\n  Achievement, Achievement of Arms, 100\r\n  Addorsed, 86, 100\r\n  Admirals, 256;\r\n    \"Admiral of England,\" 250\r\n  Admiralty, Flag of, 256\r\n  Æschylus, 6\r\n  Affrontée, 100\r\n  Aggroupment of Arms, 158, 163\r\n  Agnes de Percy: Seal, 160\r\n  Agnus Dei, as a Badge, 147, 276\r\n  Alant, Aland, 100\r\n  Albany, Duke of, 271\r\n  Albemarle, Earl of: Supporters, 92\r\n  Albert, H.R.H., the late Prince. _See_ Prince Consort\r\n  Albert Medal, 293\r\n  Alerion, 96, 100\r\n  Alianore de Bohun. _See_ Bohun\r\n  Alianore of Aquitaine: Arms, 259\r\n  Alianore of Castile and Leon:\r\n    Arms, 162, 166;\r\n    Monument, 322\r\n  Alianore, Daughter of Edward I., 77\r\n  Alice of Hesse, H.R.H., the Princess, 271\r\n  Alliance, Heraldic Record of, 159, 164;\r\n    Feudal, 194\r\n  Allusive Heraldry, 15\r\n  Alnwick Castle, 322\r\n  Alphabet, the Letters of the, in Heraldry, 135\r\n  Aluminium, 47\r\n  Ambulant, 100\r\n  Angels, Heraldic figures of, 75;\r\n    as Supporters, 75, 247\r\n  Anglo-Saxon Shields and Standards, 5, 55\r\n  Anglo-Saxon Sovereigns, Arms attributed to the, 18, 259\r\n  Anjou, Geoffrey, Count of, 188\r\n  Anjou, Queen Margaret of, 97\r\n  Annandale, Arms in, 198\r\n  Anne Boleyn, Queen, 229\r\n  Anne Stuart, Queen, 253;\r\n    Arms, 260, 262;\r\n    Badge, 229;\r\n    Motto, 265\r\n  Annulet, Annuletté, 72, 100, 101, 120;\r\n    in Modern Cadency, 193\r\n  Antelope, 80, 101\r\n  Anthony, Saint;
