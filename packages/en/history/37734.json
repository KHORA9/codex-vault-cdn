It is probable that if still more time could have\r\nbeen spent upon it, its size would have been greatly increased, for the\r\nfact of the matter is that there have been and are many more Jewish\r\nwitnesses for Christ than can readily be enumerated. But the author has\r\nall along been very desirous that his work should appear in the\r\nCentenary Year of the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst\r\nthe Jews, the same year which has seen the production of the History of\r\nthat Society written by its gifted and deeply lamented Secretary, the\r\nlate Rev. W. T. Gidney. The two books are companion works of reference,\r\nand in relation to Jewish missions they are both of inestimable value.\r\nIn some degree the one supplements the other, because the biographies\r\nindicate many of the results of the various missionary enterprises\r\nrecorded in the History.\r\n\r\nThat Hebrew Christians should publish the arguments which have convinced\r\nthem that Jesus is the Messiah, not merely for their own vindication,\r\nbut rather to lead others to the same conviction, is not at all\r\nsurprising. It is, however, peculiarly noteworthy that their literary\r\nefforts have not been limited to those of an apologetic nature, but\r\nthat, on the contrary, they have made valuable contributions to almost\r\nall the departments of human knowledge. The learned author has rendered\r\nthis one of the most pleasing features of his work, and it has evidently\r\nafforded him no little gratification to exhibit clearly the vast\r\nerudition of his numerous brethren.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. F. L. Denman, the other Secretary of the Society, has read the\r\nproofs, and has done all in his power to secure accuracy, yet as many\r\nauthorities have been consulted, and all are not of equal reliability,\r\nit is probable that some errors have been overlooked, and those to which\r\nreaders kindly draw attention will be corrected in any future edition.\r\n\r\n                       H. O. ALLBROOK,\r\n                             _Principal of the Operative Jewish\r\n                                   Converts' Institution._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEWISH WITNESSES FOR CHRIST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE history of the Mission to the Jews is coeval with the history of the\r\nChristian Church. The names of Christ's disciples mentioned in the\r\nGospels are nearly all those of Jews, and in the Epistles a great many\r\nof them are of Jewish converts. But the general reader of the New\r\nTestament does not realize the fact, because it was the fashion among\r\nthe Jews at that time to assume Greek names. For instance, several of\r\nSt. Paul's relatives bearing Greek names became Christians, but we\r\nshould not know that they were Jews if the Apostle had not written,\r\n\"Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen.\" Again, \"Lucius, and Jason, and\r\nSosipater, my kinsmen\" (Rom. xvi. 7 and 21). Whilst where we have not\r\nthis information with regard to other such names, we take it for granted\r\nthat they were Gentiles. For instance, Zenas, mentioned in Titus iii.\r\n13, is naturally taken by the general reader for a Greek, yet scholars\r\nmaintain that he had formerly been a Jewish scribe or lawyer.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this work is to shew that God had at all times in the history\r\nof the Christian Church a considerable number of believing Israelites\r\nwho, after their conversion to Christianity, rendered good service to\r\ntheir fellowmen and to the Church of Christ at large. Out of this\r\ncompany of \"the remnant according to the election of grace,\" only a very\r\nfew comparatively have their names recorded in history. The names of the\r\ngreat majority are written in the Book of Life alone. But as in the\r\nprophet Ezekiel--Noah, Job and Daniel--and as in the Epistle to the\r\nHebrews--the short list of the Old Testament saints--are the\r\nrepresentatives of a large number, so may the converts mentioned in this\r\nbook be considered as representatives of a vast number of their brethren\r\nwho had the courage and the grace given them to take up the cross and\r\nfollow Jesus.\r\n\r\nYet, of course, to give a mere nomenclature, or catalogue, of persons\r\nwould not signify much unless it were followed by a description of the\r\nlife and work of the persons concerned. The material thereto is\r\nabundant--there is a vast literature upon the subject--as will be\r\npresently seen, with the exception of that which refers to Jewish\r\nconverts of the Eastern Church. The sublime maxim, \"One soweth and\r\nanother reapeth,\" is peculiarly applicable to a biographical writer. He\r\ncannot and must not be original, but has to state the facts in the life\r\nof the person whom he attempts to delineate, just as he finds them\r\nrecorded in books, or letters, or as he knows them from personal\r\nobservation. But it is obvious that the latter can only be the case when\r\nthe subject of a biographer's writing is a contemporary and known to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe following are the sources from which the writer has immediately\r\ndrawn his information:--\r\n\r\n(1.) \"The Jewish Encyclopædia.\" Every contributor to this remarkable\r\nwork of 12 volumes is well-known in the literary and religious world as\r\na reliable authority upon the subject of his article.\r\n\r\n(2.) \"Juden Mission, a history of Protestant Missions among the Jews\r\nsince the Reformation,\" by Pastor de le Roi, well-known and esteemed in\r\nthe churches on the Continent and beyond its borders.\r\n\r\n(3.) \"Christen und Juden,\" by the late Rev. A. Fürst, D.D., formerly a\r\nMissionary and Pastor at Amsterdam, and well acquainted with Spanish\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n(4.) \"Jewish Witnesses that Jesus is the Christ,\" by the Rev. Ridley\r\nHerschell (father of Lord Chancellor Herschell), who gives his\r\nautobiography and the lives of several personal friends.\r\n\r\n(5.) \"The People, the Land and the Book,\" by B. A. M. Schahiro, of the\r\nBible House, New York.\r\n\r\n(6.) \"The Hebrew Christian Witness,\" by the Rev. Dr. Moses Margoliouth,\r\n1874-5.\r\n\r\n(7.) \"Sites and Scenes,\" by the Rev. W. T. Gidney, M.A.\r\n\r\n(8.) \"The Talmud,\" whose testimony is very reliable when it speaks of\r\nJewish Christians.\r\n\r\nUltimate sources of information, and ulterior literature, to which\r\nnearly all these writers refer, are as follows: \"Wolf, Bibliotheca\r\nHebraica.\" \"Gräetz, Geschichte der Juden.\" \"Hetzel, Gesch. der\r\nHebraischen Sprache.\" \"Fürst, Bibl. Jud.\" \"Steinschneiders\r\nBibliographisches Handbuch.\" \"Catalogue Bodl.\" \"Dict. Nat Biog.\"\r\n\"Meyer's Conversations Lexikon.\" \"Da Costa's History of the Jews in\r\nSpain.\" \"Kalkar, Die Mission unter den Juden.\" \"The Jewish Missionary\r\nIntelligence.\" \"The Jewish Missionary Herald.\" \"Saat auf Hoffnung,\" by\r\nProfessor F. Delitzsch, of Leipzig. \"Nathanael,\" by Professor Strack, of\r\nBerlin. Other biographical dictionaries and histories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nAPOSTOLIC PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Apostolic Period began on the day of Pentecost when the disciples\r\nwho were gathered together were a hundred and twenty in number (Acts i.\r\n15), but were only a section of the 500 brethren who had seen the Lord\r\nafter His resurrection (I. Cor. xv. 6). On the same day, as the result\r\nof St. Peter's first missionary sermon, \"there were added unto them\r\nabout three thousand souls\" (Acts ii. 41). A short time afterwards \"the\r\nnumber of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great\r\ncompany of the priests were obedient to the faith\" (Acts vi. 7). This\r\nprogress continued to such a degree that St. James, after hearing the\r\ninteresting missionary report of St. Paul, \"about the things which God\r\nhad wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry,\" said to him, \"Thou\r\nseest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe\"\r\n(Acts xxi. 20). How glad we should have been if we had some account of,\r\nat least, the more prominent converts of that period, and knew something\r\nof the sufferings that they had to endure for the sake of Christ.\r\nNevertheless, the Acts of the Apostles, though containing much in\r\nrelation to the progress of the Gospel among Jews and Gentiles, gives\r\nbut little information with regard to Jewish individual conversions, and\r\nmentions only two Jewish Christian martyrs--namely, St. Stephen and\r\nJames the Elder--and is even silent about the exclusion of Jewish\r\nconverts from the Temple, which we gather only from the Epistle to the\r\nHebrews. This fact is to us an evidence that St. Luke, the first\r\necclesiastical historian, had no design to shew to the world the\r\ninherent power of the Gospel exemplified by the conversion of many of\r\nthe very people who had rejected Christ, and it proves the genuineness\r\nand authenticity of the Acts of the Apostles and the date commonly\r\nassigned, for had it been written later, as some critics maintain, the\r\nauthor would surely have taken the trouble to give his readers some\r\ndetailed information concerning at least one per cent. of that vast\r\nmultitude of Jewish converts mentioned by St. James. Such is the method\r\nof the ecclesiastical historian in modern as well as in ancient times,\r\nas the following two examples will shew: Pastor de le Roi, Jewish\r\nmissionary historian, has for years not only collected statistics of\r\nJewish converts in various churches, and summed up the whole number as\r\nbeing 224,000 in the nineteenth century, but he has also furnished us\r\nwith a great deal of information concerning the history of many of these\r\nconverts. For, as the Rev. W. T. Gidney rightly says, \"Jewish converts\r\nmust be weighed as well as counted.\" The second example is Hegesippus,\r\nwho, according to Eusebius, was a Palestinian Hebrew Christian, and\r\nlived in Rome about 150 A.D. He is the father of Church history, and\r\nwrote a book under the title \"Hyponeymata Pente,\" with the special\r\ndesign to answer the question of the Pharisees, \"Have any of the rulers\r\nbelieved in Him?\" and to shew that the Gospel made rapid progress among\r\nthe Jews in the first century in spite of great opposition. Of this\r\nopposition the Jewish Liturgy to this day bears witness in the so-called\r\n\"Blessing against the heretics,\" which Samuel the Little composed in the\r\nSynagogue of Yabne, in the presence of Gamaliel the Elder. Justin Martyr\r\nin his Dialogue, Origen in Homily 18, Jerome on Isaiah, complained of\r\nit, and it has, alas, been a source of trouble to the Jews at various\r\ntimes throughout the Christian ages. Hegesippus supplies information\r\nabout a number of Jewish sects, who regarded each other as heretics. It\r\nis a pity that the greater part of his book has been lost, and we have\r\nonly a few fragments in \"Euseb. History iv.,\" and an extract in \"Photius\r\nBibliotheca\" (page 232). That probably contained detailed information\r\nabout the more prominent converts in the Apostolic age. Still, the most\r\nvaluable relic for us is his list of Hebrew Christian bishops in regular\r\nsuccession in the mother Church at Jerusalem. These are as follows:\r\nJames, the Lord's brother (Gal. i. 19), of whom Hegesippus states that\r\nhe was martyred while praying in the Temple. Symeon about 62 A.D.,\r\nJustus I. 64, Zacchæus 112, Tobias 114, Benjamin 116, Justin 118,\r\nMatthias 120, Philip 122, Seneca 125, Justus II. 126, Levi 128, Ephres\r\n130, Joseph 132, Jude 133. The shortness of their episcopates probably\r\nindicates that it was a time of great tribulation. To this list may\r\nperhaps be added Ananias, who baptized Saul of Tarsus at Damascus, and,\r\naccording to tradition, was subsequently bishop there and suffered\r\nmartyrdom (See \"Schaff. Bible Dictionary\"); Crispus, Chief of the Jewish\r\nSynagogue (Acts xviii. 8), who, according to tradition (\"Constituit\r\nApost.\" vii. 46), was afterwards Bishop of Ægina; Clement, of Rome, who,\r\naccording to Bishop Lightfoot, was an Hellenistic Jewish convert or son\r\nof a convert. The bishop came to this conclusion, after weighing much\r\nthe internal evidence of his Epistle to the Corinthians.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Rev. Dr. Giles writes: \"In the 'Homiles and Recognitiones,' falsely\r\nascribed to Clement, his father is said to have been one Faustinus,\r\ndescended from the family of the Roman Cæsars, and this absurd fable is\r\ncopied in the 'Liber Pontificates,' or book of the Roman Pontiffs, and\r\nin the work of Eusebius, Bishop of Lyons.\" (\"Hebrew Records,\" vol. ii.\r\n294).\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo of the converts of the first century are mentioned in the Talmud and\r\nreceive there an excellent testimonial. The first is Nicodemus,\r\nidentical, according to the writer in the \"Jewish Encyclopædia,\" with\r\nNicodemus ben Gorian. He is said to have been a great saint. The other\r\nis Jacob of Kefar Sakanya (Simai). He once met R. Eliezer in the upper\r\nmarket-place of Sepphoris and asked his opinion on a curious ritualistic\r\nquestion bearing upon Deut. xxiii. 8. As R. Eliezer declined to give an\r\nopinion, Jacob acquainted him with the interpretation of Jesus derived\r\nfrom Micah i. 7. R. Eliezer was pleased with the interpretation, and was\r\nconsequently suspected of Christian leanings by the governor (Abodah\r\nZarah, 17. a). On another occasion, Jacob went to heal R. Eleasar ben\r\nDama of a poisonous bite by a serpent in the name of Jesus, but his\r\nuncle, R. Ishmael, would not allow it. Jacob said to him, Rabbi Ishmael,\r\nmy brother, let me heal him, and I will prove to you from the Torah,\r\nthat it is allowed, but R. I. was obstinate. In the meantime the patient\r\ndied, and his uncle apostrophized the corpse in these words: \"Happy art\r\nthou Ben Dama that thy body is pure and thy soul departed in purity, as\r\nthou hast not transgressed the words of thy fellow rabbis\" (Abodah\r\nZarah, 27. b).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSUB-APOSTOLIC OR PATRISTIC PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides Hegesippus, one reckoned among the church fathers was\r\nEpiphanius, a native Jew of Palestine, who embraced Christianity at\r\nsixteen years of age, and eventually became Bishop of Constantia, and\r\ndied at sea (according to Bartolocci) in 403 A.D. He wrote a book\r\nentitled, \"Panarion,\" in which he gives information about eighty\r\nheretical sects, including Jewish; also a treatise on Biblical weights\r\nand measures and on the lives of the Prophets, in which he makes Hebrew\r\nquotations.\r\n\r\nAnother noted Jewish convert belonging to this period was Joseph, a\r\nphysician of Tiberias (called by the Jews \"The Apostate\"). He had been a\r\nmember of the Sanhedrin in his native town, was sent by them as a\r\ndelegate to the Jews in Cilicia, where he became acquainted with the\r\nChristian bishop, who gave him a New Testament. According to Milman\r\n(vol. iii., p. 179) he was detected reading it, was hurried to the\r\nsynagogue and scourged. The bishop interfered. But he was afterwards\r\nseized again and thrown into the river Cydnus, from which he hardly\r\nescaped with his life, and was baptized. On his return he told his\r\nfriends in Palestine that the Gospel made progress among the enlightened\r\nJews. The Emperor Constantine elevated him to the rank of Comes or Count\r\nof the Empire, and he devoted his life to the building of churches at\r\nTiberias, Capernaum, Nazareth, and Sepphoris (Dio Cæsarea). It is worth\r\nmentioning in this connection the report of Epiphanius that Hillel, who\r\nsucceeded his father Judah II. in the patriarchate of Tiberias, embraced\r\nChristianity and was secretly baptized on his death-bed by a bishop.\r\nJoseph, his physician (says Milman) had witnessed the scene which\r\nwrought strongly upon his mind. The house of Hillel after his death was\r\nkept closely shut up by his suspicious countrymen. Joseph obtained\r\nentrance, and found there the Gospels of St. John and of St. Matthew,\r\nand the Acts in a Hebrew translation.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] This is denied by Gräetz. See article in the \"Jewish Encyclopædia,\"\r\nwhere it is asserted that this Hillel was honoured by Julian the\r\nApostate. But we have also the solution of the difficulty there. It is\r\navowed that there is no clear distinction between Juda II. and Juda III.\r\nMilman says distinctly that this Hillel was the son of Juda II., whereas\r\nJewish writers make him to be the son of Juda III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTabius, of high priestly descent, son of one Anan, probably the one who\r\nwas sent on embassy to the Emperor Claudius, is also mentioned by\r\necclesiastical writers as having embraced Christianity.\r\n\r\nAsher ben Levi, called Abed al Masih, lived in the fourth century in\r\nSinjar Mesopotamia. His school companions, both Zoroastrian and\r\nChristian, shunned him, but the latter on one occasion baptized him.\r\nAsher's mother hid him from his father, who was a warden of the\r\nsynagogue, fearing his anger, but he was eventually killed by him. A\r\nchurch was built afterwards in his memory. There is a Syriac MS. which\r\ncontains this story.\r\n\r\nJacob, of Kefar Neuburaya, another Hebrew Christian of the fourth\r\ncentury, is mentioned in the Talmud as one whose opinions met with\r\napproval by the rabbis in two instances. One of those may be quoted. In\r\nthe School of Cæsarea he interpreted Hab. ii. 19 as being a rebuke of\r\nsimony. On the same occasion he indicated Ben Eleazer as being a worthy\r\ncandidate for the rabbinate (Yer. Bik. iii. 3. Midr. Shemuél vii.). Isi,\r\nof Cæsarea counts him among the Judæo-Christians, applying to him the\r\nBiblical word sinner (Eccl. R. vii. 47). The appellation Jacob Minah I.\r\n= Jacob the heretic, met with in the Medrashim, may refer to the same\r\nsubject of the article in the \"Jewish Encyclopædia.\" As its author is\r\nDr. Max Seligsohn, the official editor, we may assume that it is now\r\ngranted that by the word Minim in the Jewish Liturgy is meant Jewish\r\nChristians. No wonder then that these have always protested, and\r\nsometimes rather too vehemently, against the collect, and wished it to\r\nbe expunged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD OF THE PUBLICATION OF THE TALMUD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Jewish Christians fled to Pella, at the time of the destruction\r\nof Jerusalem, their brethren the rabbinists were very angry with them,\r\nand probably accused them of want of patriotism, as we know they did\r\nafterwards, because they did not enlist in the army of the false\r\nMessiah, Bar-Cochba. However, during the first Christian centuries the\r\nseparation between them was not quite so wide and marked as after the\r\npublication of the Talmud. The Talmud itself testifies that asperities\r\nwere occasionally smoothed over by continual intercourse and exchange of\r\nthought on religious and other topics. Yes, even friendship was\r\npossible. It is related that a heretic sent once on one of his own\r\nfeasts an imperial coin as a present to R. Juda Nasia. (Abodah Zarah\r\n5._b_). The feeling of resentment against Jewish Christians gradually\r\ndiminished. This may be seen from the following amusing story. A certain\r\nheretic once annoyed R. Joshua ben Levi whilst he was reading the\r\nScriptures, probably with questions as to the meaning of a Messianic\r\nprophecy. R. Joshua, believing that there is a certain moment in the day\r\nwhen God is angry, because it is written, \"For His anger endureth but a\r\nmoment\" (Ps. xxx. 5), and believing too that this moment is indicated\r\nby a curious natural phenomenon, when the comb of a cock gets red, he\r\ntied a cock to the foot of the bed and patiently watched for the sign,\r\nso that he might have a good opportunity of cursing the heretic during\r\nthe moment of God's anger. But before that moment came he fell asleep,\r\nand when he awoke he noticed that the cock's comb remained white as\r\nbefore, so he concluded that it was not right to curse any one, for it\r\nis written \"The Lord is good to all, and His tender mercies are over all\r\nHis works\" (Ps. cxlv. 9). Again \"Also to punish the just is not good.\"\r\n(Prov. xvii. 26) (Abodah Zarah 4_h_.)\r\n\r\nThe two classes used generally to meet in a public library called\r\n[Hebrew: bi avidan] or in another place of assembly called [Hebrew: bi\r\nnetzrafi] and we may rightly infer that some, at all events, of the\r\nbeautiful sayings in the Talmud which resemble N. T. passages are due to\r\nthe influence of the Hebrew Christians upon the rabbis in their\r\ndiscussions with them during the time when the Talmud as such, or at\r\nleast the Gemara, was only in the course of formation. One passage will\r\nsuffice to show that the rabbis during this period were well acquainted\r\nwith the N. T. There was once a discussion between R. Gamaliel and a\r\nChristian (called a philosopher) with regard to the law of inheritance.\r\nThe Christian maintained that inasmuch as a woman is placed on an equality\r\nwith a man in the N. T., she has an equal right with her brother to inherit\r\nthe parental property. To that Gamaliel replied by quoting Matt. v. 17,\r\nwith a very slight alteration to suit his purpose. [Hebrew: ana lo\r\nlemifhat min oryata demoshe etiti velo leosfi al oryata demoshe etiti.]\r\n\r\n\"I have not come to destroy the law of Moses, nor have I come to add to\r\nthe law of Moses\" (Shabbath 116 b). Moreover, the fact that some Rabbis\r\nat that time thought that the Evangelium should be burned--and also\r\nHebrew Christian books generally--proves that they were acquainted with\r\nthe contents, but does not shew that they were very bitterly hostile to\r\ntheir brethren, and they may have even referred to gnostic writings.\r\nJustin Martyr's Dialogue with Trypho, probably R. Tarphon mentioned in\r\nthe Talmud, is well known.\r\n\r\nIt was otherwise after the Babylonian Talmud was finished in the fifth\r\ncentury. This huge building--which Scribes, Tanas, Amoras, and later\r\ngaons, tosafits, and quite a number of commentators in successive\r\ngenerations have reared up--was like the Tower of Babel, and brought\r\nconfusion within the ranks of the Jews. The following is the language of\r\none who took a leading part in laying one stone upon another: What is\r\nBabel? R. Johanon said: It is confused in the Scripture, confused in the\r\nMishnah, and confused in the six orders of the Talmud. \"He hath set me\r\nin darkness as they that be dead of old\" (Lam. iii. 6). Rav Yirmiah\r\nsaid: This refers to the Babylonian Talmud. It formed an iron partition\r\nbetween Judæo-Christians and their brethren. While formerly tradition\r\nwas only handed down by word of mouth, and many were liable to forget or\r\ndisregard it, when once it was written, codified and taught in the\r\nsynagogues and schools to all except women, the poor, unenlightened\r\npeople in their joy at being at last able to read the oral law, which\r\nwas pretended to have been given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai at the\r\nsame time as the written law, clave to it with all the enthusiastic\r\nardour of their souls, and refused to have anything to do with the\r\nGospel or the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nMilman relates a legend of this time which was current in the sixth\r\ncentury; though it is in an exaggerated form, yet on the whole it is\r\nquite credible. \"While Menas was Bishop of Constantinople, the child of\r\na Jewish glassblower went to church with the rest and partook of the\r\nsacred elements. The father inquiring the cause of his delay, discovered\r\nwhat he had done. In his fury he seized him and shut him up in the\r\nblazing furnace. The mother went wandering about the city, wailing and\r\nseeking her lost offspring. The third day she sat down by the door of\r\nthe workshop, still weeping, and calling on the name of the child. The\r\nchild answered from the furnace. The doors were forced open, and the\r\nchild was discovered sitting unhurt amid the red-hot ashes. Subsequently\r\nthe mother and child were baptized.\" (Milman's \"History of the Jews,\"\r\nvol. iii. p. 230.)\r\n\r\nFor several centuries we do not hear of many distinguished Jews\r\nembracing Christianity, and though it is asserted that whole\r\ncongregations in Candia did so in the seventh century, it is not our\r\nobject to investigate this. Undoubtedly, after the rise of\r\nMohammedanism, the Church had enough to do to stand on her defence\r\nagainst the new and even more fanatical antagonist, and the Jews were on\r\nthe whole neglected. Besides, there were scarcely any Christian teachers\r\nwho understood Hebrew, and the N. T. was not yet translated into the\r\nsacred tongue. Yet we find one very distinguished Jewish convert in the\r\nseventh century. This was Julian of Toledo, Primate of Spain, called by\r\none of his successors, \"A rose among thorns.\" He was baptized in the\r\ncathedral of his native place, became archdeacon in 656, Bishop in 680,\r\nand died in 690. He was President of the Twelfth Council of Toledo when\r\nhe urged King Erwig to pass some severe laws against his former\r\nco-religionists, prohibiting them to blaspheme the Trinity and to\r\npossess Christian slaves. Nevertheless, the writer in the \"Jewish\r\nEncyclopædia\" speaks of him \"as a man of great sagacity and discretion,\r\nprudent in judgment, very charitable, and tempering severity with\r\nmildness,\" and further informs us that he used to associate with the\r\nJews. Consequently, he could not have been so very hostile against them.\r\nBut on this point it is necessary once for all to remark that the severe\r\nopinion that used to be held by the Jews in general about Hebrew\r\nChristians was, to a great extent, owing to the unfair judgment passed\r\nupon them indiscriminately by Jewish historians. It is now acknowledged\r\nthat even the modern Gräetz was unfair in this respect. We by no means\r\nwant to exonerate the few bigots and fanatics like Nunes Henrique who\r\nacted as spy of the Maranos, or others who agitated for the burning of\r\nthe Talmud, and strongly condemn men like Dr. Briman, so-called Justus,\r\nthe associate and abettor of the Roman Catholic Theologian Rohling at\r\nPrague, in recent times, but it must be remembered that there is a great\r\ndifference between anti-Talmudists and anti-Semites, and that by far the\r\nvast majority of Jewish converts, even in the ages of predominant\r\nbigotry among Christians and Jews, have defended their brethren against\r\nfalse accusations, as will be seen later on. To return from this\r\ndigression to Julian. He wrote, \"Historia rebelleonis Pauli,\" also a\r\nbook under the title, \"De comprobatione ætatis sextæ contra Judæos.\" The\r\nwork deals with Messianic prophecies of the Bible, in which he adopts\r\nthe chronology of the Septuagint, and addresses the Jews with these\r\nwords, \"Viam perdidisti viam ergo se quere, ut per viam venias ad\r\nsalutem.\"\r\n\r\nBut even in that age, the eve of the so-called Middle Ages, the age of\r\nthe gaons, when there was a Prince of the Captivity in Babylon who\r\nexercised supreme religious authority over the Jews in the East, and so\r\nfar as Spain and France, we hear occasionally a voice from the midst of\r\nthe Synagogue bearing an unwitting testimony for Christ. Cottan Mather,\r\nin his \"Faith of the Fathers,\" quotes the words of Rabbi Samuel Marachus\r\n(Abbas Samuel Abbu Nasr Ibn) when speaking of the Messiah, as follows:\r\n\"The Prophet Amos mentions a fourth crime (ii. 6) of selling the Just\r\nOne for silver, for which we have been in our captivity. It manifestly\r\nappears to me that for selling that Just One we are justly punished. It\r\nis now 1000 years and more, and in all this we have made no good hand of\r\nit among the Gentiles, nor is there any likelihood of our ever any more\r\nturning to good. Oh, my God! I am afraid, lest the Jesus, whom the\r\nChristians worship, be the Just One we sold for silver.\" (See \"Lectures\r\non the Jews,\" p. 430, Glasgow, 1839.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nJEWISH CONVERTS IN THE EASTERN CHURCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAleksyeyev, Aleksander (called Wolf Nachlass), born in 1820, at\r\nNazarevietz, government of Podolsk, of poor Jewish parents. At the age\r\nof ten he was impressed into military service by the press-gang\r\n(poimshchiki) of Nicolas I., and sent away to the distant city of\r\nVolsks, government of Saratov. It was the political and missionary\r\npolicy of Nicolas I. to take young boys from their parents and to train\r\nthem in military schools, so that after they had completed their service\r\nof twenty-five years, they might return home and act as missionaries to\r\ntheir parents. Aleksyeyev for a long time resisted Christian teaching,\r\nand the officials considered him a most stubborn subject. However, about\r\n1845, he changed his views entirely, and not only became a member of the\r\nOrthodox Russian Church, but managed to convert about five hundred\r\nJewish Cantonists, for which he was promoted in 1848 to the rank of a\r\nnon-commissioned officer, and was honoured by the Emperor's thanks.\r\nAbout 1855, Aleksander was so unfortunate as to lose the use of his\r\nlegs. He then settled in Novogorod, and during his long illness wrote\r\nthe following works on ethnographic and missionary topics:--English\r\ntitles: 1. \"The Triumph of Christian Teaching over the Talmudic\r\nTeaching, or a Soul-saving Conversation of a Christian and a Jew on the\r\nComing of the Messiah\" (St. Petersburg, 1859); 2. \"Religious Service,\r\nHoly Day and Religious Rites of the Jews To-day\" (Novogorod, 1861); 3.\r\n\"The Public Life of the Jews, their Habits, Customs and Prejudices\"\r\n(_ib._ 1868); 4. \"Colloquies of an Orthodox Christian with a\r\nNewly-Converted Jew\" (St. Petersburg, 1872); 5. \"A Former Jew for\r\nMonastries and Monasticism\" (Novogorod, 1875); 6. \"The Conversion to\r\nChristianity of an Observer of the Jewish Law\" (_ib._ 1882); 7. \"Do the\r\nJews use Christian Blood?\" (_ib._ 1886), and several others. His works\r\nare interesting, as he was the first Jew in Russia to give a description\r\nof the life and customs of his Jewish brethren. He refuted the absurd\r\nand criminal blood accusation.\r\n\r\nGregory Bar-Hebræus (son of a Hebrew) Abu Ab-Foraj Ibu Harun, Jacobite\r\nSyrian historian, physician, philosopher and theologian; born at\r\nMalatia, Asiatic Turkey, 1226; died at Moragha, Persia, 1286. Gregory\r\nfirst studied medicine under his father Aaron, who embraced\r\nChristianity, and was probably baptized in his youth. This accounts for\r\nhis not being conversant with Hebrew, though he was well acquainted with\r\nJewish doctrines. He was successively Bishop of Guba (1246), of Lakaba\r\n(1247), and of Aleppo (1253). In 1264 he was named \"Mafriana,\" or\r\nPrimate of the Eastern Jacobites, with his seat at Tekrit on the Tigris.\r\nGregory was a prolific writer on theology, philosophy, ethics, history,\r\ngrammar, medicine, mathematics and astronomy. Some of his works were\r\nwritten in Arabic, but most of them in Syriac. He was the last great\r\nSyriac writer, though he is important rather as a collector than as an\r\nindependent writer. He is best known for his Syriac grammar, \"Ketaba de\r\nSemhe,\" his \"Chronicle\" in two parts, ecclesiastical and political; his\r\n\"Menarat Kudshe,\" a compendium of theology, philosophy, medicine,\r\nphysics and metaphysics, and his scholia on the Old and the New\r\nTestament (Auzar Raze). In the last-named he occasionally cites readings\r\nfrom the Samaritan text; it is interesting to note that in a scholium to\r\n2 Kings xvii. 28, he says: \"The Law (_i.e._ text of the Pentateuch) of\r\nthe Samaritans does not agree with that of the Jews, but with the\r\nSeptuagint.\" He occasionally cites opinions of the Jews, _e.g._, on Ps.\r\nviii. 2, on the Shem Hamephorash (the name Jehovah). In the introduction\r\nto his commentary on Job he mentions as a writer the priest Asaph\r\n(brother of Ezra the Scribe), who identifies Job with Jobab. In speaking\r\nof the Apocryphal account of the death of Isaiah, he cites \"one of the\r\nHebrew books\" as authority. (Nestle Marginalien ii. 48).\r\n\r\nRubinstein Anton Gregryevich (not to be confounded with Josef, also a\r\nRussian great musician), was born 1829, in the village of Wetchwotgretz,\r\nBessarabia, died at Peterhof, near St. Petersburg, in 1894. His parents\r\nembraced Christianity, and the children were probably baptized when\r\nstill young. Anton was first taught music by his mother (Katherina\r\nKhristoferovna, _née_ Lowenstein), and then studied at Moscow. The great\r\nservices rendered by him in the advance of music in Russia were\r\nrecognized by the Czar, who decorated him with the Vladimir order.\r\n\r\nRubinstein Nikolai, born in Moscow 1835, died in Paris 1881, was the\r\nbrother of the above, and was well-known in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nJEWISH CONVERTS IN THE WESTERN CHURCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn giving an account of well-known Jewish converts in the Christian\r\nChurch, one is limited to the information which is supplied from sources\r\ngenerally connected with the Western or Roman Catholic Church. The\r\nsubject naturally divides itself into two parts--(_a_) The\r\npre-reformation period, (_b_) The post-reformation period. In the former\r\nthe Roman Church displayed great zeal, though not according to\r\nknowledge, in her energetic missionary enterprise among the Jews. There\r\nwas a missionary seminary in Spain in which men studied Hebrew\r\nliterature and qualified themselves for carrying on the controversy with\r\nthe Jews. Hence we read of frequent disputations which were held by the\r\nJewish and Gentile missionaries with the most learned rabbis, often in\r\nthe presence of bishops, noblemen, and princes. But, alas! the methods\r\nemployed were also often those of force and intrigue, and consequently\r\nun-Christian in the extreme, and the converts thus gained were only such\r\nin appearance, and this led as we know to the terrible Inquisition and\r\nto the final expulsion of the Jews from Spain. In the latter period,\r\nafter the Reformation and onwards, the Roman Church has apparently\r\nslackened her zeal for the conversion of the Jews. She has no distinct\r\nmissionary organization, and we only hear now and then of clandestine\r\nabductions, generally through the instrumentality of domestic servants,\r\nlike the famous Mortara case and the Coen case in the time of Pius IX.,\r\nand that of the Jewish girl of Prague, enticed into a nunnery, which\r\nthe _Jewish Chronicle_ reported a few years ago.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, among those who have voluntarily joined the Roman Church\r\nin various centuries, we verily believe--on the ground of their social\r\nstanding, their public works, published writings and personal\r\ncharacter--that they embraced Christianity out of pure conviction, and\r\nconscientiously discharged their duties according to the light that was\r\nin them at the time.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of Jewish Roman Catholic converts, who have\r\nbecome historical, very often by making a good impression upon their\r\ncontemporaries, and having sought the welfare of the people from whom\r\nthey sprung. The names are given in alphabetical order, as this method\r\nseems to be the more convenient for the compiler, and the time and\r\ncountry in which they lived are added. As they all were members of one\r\nChurch, it is not very material to follow the centuries in regular\r\nsuccession, or to treat of the countries they belonged to separately. An\r\nexception is however made with regard to England, in which the \"Domus\r\nConversorum,\" the house of converts in London, requires a separate\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nAbiathar ha Kohen Esther, of Saragossa, Spain, after her baptism, in the\r\nfifteenth century, married Don Alfonso, son of the King of Aragon. Her\r\nsister Leah also embraced Christianity, and married the Marano Martin\r\nSanchez. From them some of the Spanish nobility are descended.\r\n\r\nAbilis, Simon, a convert in Prague. According to the report of the\r\nJesuit Eder, he was killed by his father, Lazarus, March 21, 1694,\r\nbecause he refused to renounce Christianity. The father was put in\r\nprison, where he committed suicide by hanging himself with his\r\nphylacteries.\r\n\r\nAbner, of Burgos (called also Alfonso of Valladolid), born in 1270, died\r\nin 1348, became a Christian at the age of sixty. He was a physician by\r\nprofession, and learned in Talmud, philosophy and astronomy. He wrote\r\nthe following works: 1. \"Moreh Zedek\" (Teacher of Righteousness). 2. \"A\r\nDialogue between a Christian and a Jew.\" 3. \"A Reply to Kimchi's book\r\nand on Wars of the Lord.\" 4. \"Old Testament Foundations for Christian\r\nDoctrines.\" 5. \"Libro des los tres gracias.\" 6. \"The Offering of\r\nJealousy.\" 7. \"A Reply to Replies.\" 8. \"Igereth hagezerah,\" in which he\r\ngives reasons for his conversion.\r\n\r\nAbraham Beneveniste, senior chief rabbi of Seville, together with his\r\nson and son-in-law, also rabbis joined the Church in 1492, when they\r\nassumed the name of Cosonel.\r\n\r\nAbravanel Samuel (one of the three of the same name) was baptized in\r\n1391, when he took the name of Juan de Sevilla.\r\n\r\nAemilius, Paulus, born in Breslau, Germany probably in the first part of\r\nthe sixteenth century, died at Rome in 1576. After embracing\r\nChristianity he was appointed Professor of Hebrew at Ingoldstadt in\r\n1547. He was the first Jewish bibliographer.\r\n\r\nAlexander de Franciscis Hebraeus. As a Jew he was known as Elisha de\r\nRoma. After his baptism in the sixteenth century he entered the Order\r\nof the Dominican Friars, in which he distinguished himself as an orator.\r\nPope Clement VIII. appointed him proctor, then vicar-general, and\r\nfinally Bishop of Forli. He wrote--1. Hebrew notes on Genesis and\r\nExodus, with special reference to the text of the Vulgate. 2. A book\r\nentitled \"De Tempore et de Sanctis.\"\r\n\r\nAlexanderson (Ben Alexander) Daniel. After embracing Christianity at\r\nRouen, in France, 1621, he wrote in Syriac or rabbinic an open letter,\r\ngiving the reasons for his conversion and calling upon his former\r\nco-religionists to follow his example. The letter was translated into\r\nseveral European languages, and went through two English editions.\r\n(London, 1688 and 1703.)\r\n\r\nAlfonsi Petrus (Moses Sephardi) was born at Huesca, Aragon, in 1062, and\r\ndied in 1110. He was physician to King Alfonso VI. After his baptism he\r\nwrote a series of twelve dialogues between Moses and Pedro, _i.e._,\r\nbetween himself as a Jew and a Christian.\r\n\r\nAlonzo de Cartagena, son of Solomon ha Levi, or Paul of Burgos, was born\r\nin Burgos, Spain, in 1385, and was baptized with his father, brothers\r\nand sisters in 1391. After studying philosophy and law, he became deacon\r\nof Santiago and Segovia. He and his brother, called Gonzalo Garcia,\r\nrepresented Spain at the Council of Basel. Alonzo, who was called \"the\r\njoy of Spain and the delight of religion,\" published several\r\nphilosophical and theological works, as well as some erotic poems.\r\n\r\nAndreas Johannes, a native of Xativa in the sixteenth century. After his\r\nconversion he wrote a letter to the congregations of Southern France,\r\nexhorting them to accept Christianity (Paris, 1552). His works which\r\nwere originally written in Spanish, were translated into Italian by\r\nDomenio Castila (Seville, 1537), and frequently reprinted in Leipzig,\r\nVenice and Utrecht.\r\n\r\nAlfonso de Zamora, born about 1474, embraced Christianity in 1506, and\r\nhis father Juan did likewise. Alfonso became professor of Oriental\r\nlanguages at the University of Salamanca. For over fifteen years he\r\nlaboured under the auspices of Cardinal Ximenes, in the preparation of\r\nthe Complutensian Polyglot. He wrote a number of grammatical and\r\nlexicographical works, an Epistle in Hebrew and Latin to the Jews in\r\nRome, in which he tried to convince them of the truth of Christianity,\r\ntranslations of Commentaries on Isaiah and Jeremiah, &c., an\r\nIntroduction to the Targum, and a polemical work entitled, \"Libro de la\r\nSabiduria de Dios.\"\r\n\r\nAnacletus II., Pietro Pierleoni Antipope to Innocent II., from 1130 to\r\n1138. It is maintained that he was a very near descendant of one Baruch,\r\na rich Jew who had joined the Roman Church. There can be no doubt that\r\nhe was of Jewish origin, as Bernard of Clairvaux, a supporter of\r\nInnocent, in a letter to Lothair, wrote that \"to the shame of Christ a\r\nman of Jewish origin was come to occupy the chair of St. Peter.\" He was\r\nfriendly to the Jews. This is interesting enough, but the more so,\r\nbecause it gave rise to the legend of a Jewish Pope by the name of\r\nAndreas, discovered among some penitential liturgies issued by Eliezer\r\nAshkenazi (Frankfurt on Maine, 1854.) In this it is said Andreas had\r\nhimself embraced Christianity, and become successively Cardinal and\r\nPope. In answer to an appeal from the Jews for protection against an\r\nimminent persecution, he not only, by a speech, subdued the popular\r\npassion but also calmed the Jews by sending them a penitential prayer\r\nwhich had been composed in Hebrew, signed with his name Andreas.\r\n\r\nAnother legend in circulation among the Jews, varying in the details, is\r\nthat this Pope's name was Elhanan, the son of Simon the Great, a rabbi\r\nof Mayence, who was kidnapped when quite a child by a servant, on the\r\nDay of Atonement. And when he became Pope, the story of his origin was\r\ntold him by his old Professor of Wurzburg, when he summoned the Jews of\r\nMayence to send a delegation to Rome, to discuss the question between\r\nJudaism and Christianity with him. Accordingly, his own father appeared\r\nbefore him, and one evening made himself known to him by his birth-signs\r\nor, as some say, by a peculiar move in chess which he had learned from\r\nhim. The result was that the Pope suddenly fled in disguise to Mayence\r\nand returned to Judaism. But his end was either that he was forcibly\r\nburned at the stake or that he committed suicide. (See \"Sippurim,\" by J.\r\nB. Brandeis, Prague) This is the Judea de Monti, whose Jewish name was\r\nJoseph Zarafti, was born at Fez, hence he is sometimes called \"Joseph\r\nMoro,\" died before 1597. After his conversion to Christianity, he\r\nlaboured as a missionary to the Jews at Rome. He published the sermons\r\nwhich he preached to them under the Hebrew title [Hebrew: mevuchat\r\nhayehudim] (\"Confusion of the Jews.\") The Roman Jews then protested\r\nto the Curia, when he issued a mild letter to them in 1581, under the\r\ntitle [Hebrew: igeret shalom] (\"Lettera de Pace.\")\r\n\r\nAquin de Philippe, born at Carpentras about 1578, died in 1650 at Paris.\r\nHe was converted to Christianity in Aquino. His Jewish name was\r\nMordecai. He was a voluminous writer; the following is a list of his\r\nworks. 1. \"Primigenæ Voces, sui Radices Breves Linguæ Sanctæ\" (Paris,\r\n1620). 2. \"Pirke Aboth Sententiæ Rabbinarum Hebraices cum Latina\r\nversione\" (_ib._ 1620). 3. \"Dessertation du Tabernacle et du camp des\r\nIsraelites\" (_ib._ 1623). 4. \"Interpretatio Arboris Cabbalisticae\"\r\n(_ib._ 1625). 5. \"Behinat Olam\" (L'Examen du Monde) of Yedaiah Bedersi,\r\nHebrew and French (_ib._ 1629). 6. \"Ma'arik ha--Maareket, Dictionarum\r\nHebraicum Chaldaicum, Talmudico-Rabbinicum\" (_ib._ 1629). 7. \"Kina\r\nLicrimae in Obitum Cardinalis de Berulli,\" Hebrew and Latin (_ib._\r\n1629). 8. [Hebrew: yud gimel midot] \"Veterum Rabbinorum in Exponendo\r\nPentateucho Modi tredecim\" (_ib._ 1620).\r\n\r\nAquinas, Louis Henri de, son of the above, wrote a translation of the\r\ncommentary on the book of Esther, by R. Solomon ben Isaac, with extracts\r\nrelating thereto from the Talmud and Yalkut (Paris, 1627), and a Latin\r\ntranslation of the first four chapters of Levi Ben Gerson's commentary\r\non the book of Job. (_ib._ 1623.)\r\n\r\nAronda, Pedro de, Bishop of Calahisra and President of the Council of\r\nCastile in the latter part of the fifteenth century, was the son of\r\nGongolo Alonzo, a Hebrew Christian. Aronda's brother, too, was Bishop of\r\nMontreal in Sicily.\r\n\r\nBaena, Francisco, and his brother, Juan Alfonso Di, flourished at the\r\nend of the fifteenth century and in the sixteenth century. They were\r\nboth Spanish poets.\r\n\r\nBaptista, Gioranni Giona Galileo, was born in Safed in 1588, and died in\r\n1668. His Jewish name was Judah Jonah ben Isaac. After travelling on the\r\nContinent, and being assistant rabbi in Hamburg, he embraced\r\nChristianity in Poland in 1625. Then he went to Italy and was appointed\r\nProfessor at the University of Pisa, and later as one of the librarians\r\nat the Vatican. He wrote (1.) \"A Sermon in Hebrew and Latin on the\r\nMessiah and the Outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles.\" (2.)\r\n\"Limud hameshehim\" (Doctrines of Christianity), a Hebrew translation of\r\nthe Italian Catechism of Robert Bellarmin. (3.) \"Berith Hahadasha,\"[3] a\r\nHebrew translation of the N. T., with a preface by Clement IX. (4.) A\r\nHebrew Chaldaic Lexicon. (5.) A Treatise on the name of Jesus, \"Hillufin\r\nsheben sheloshah Targumim,\" a collection of the differences in the\r\nTargums. Some of the works are in MS. in the Vatican library.\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] According to G. M. Löwen in \"Nathanael,\" 1903, No. 5, the Hebrew\r\ntitle of this translation is \"Arbaá Abne Hagilyonim Mehattorah\r\nHahadashah, Asher Neetku Milshon romi lilshon ibri al yad Johanan\r\nhatobel Jonah. Weeherim otham Terumah la Kadosh hakohen hagadol\r\nKlimenthi Tisshü.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBaptista, Garvanni Salomo Romano Eliano. He was born at Alexandria and\r\ndied in Rome in 1589. He was the grandson of Elijah Levita, the famous\r\nHebrew grammarian. Hearing that his brother was baptized at Venice, he\r\nhastened there to win him back to Judaism, but became a Christian\r\nhimself in 1551. He wrote a catechism in Hebrew and Arabic, and similar\r\nreligious books, but gained especial notoriety as an anti-Talmudist, and\r\nused his influence at the Papal Court to have the Talmud and other\r\nrabbinic literature, destroyed altogether. This actually happened in\r\nsome places. But Baptista had to suffer for it, and his name, together\r\nwith Joseph Moro and Ananel di Folgio, also converts and companions, are\r\nstill branded by Jewish writers. When, in 1561, he was sent by Pope Pius\r\nIV. on a mission to Egypt, the Jews of Alexandria bitterly persecuted\r\nhim at the instigation of his own mother.\r\n\r\nBernard, Sarah, born in Paris in 1844, of Dutch Jewish parentage. At the\r\nrequest of her father she was received into the Roman Catholic Church.\r\nHer early years were spent in a convent. Later she studied dramatic art\r\nin the conservatoire, and became famous.\r\n\r\nBauer, Marie-Bernard (Herman Cohen), was born at Budapest in 1829, died\r\n1898. After his conversion to Catholicism he joined the Carmelite order.\r\nHe distinguished himself as a preacher, first at Vienna, where he\r\ndelivered a series of addresses, which were published (1866) under the\r\ntitle, \"Le Judaisme Comme Preuve du Christianisme.\" Eventually he\r\nattained to the rank of a bishop. In 1869 he became father confessor to\r\nthe Empress Eugenie. On November 17th, 1869, he delivered the dedicatory\r\naddress at the opening of the Suez Canal. He also published a book of\r\nsermons, \"Le But de la Vie\" (1869), and a pamphlet, \"Napoléon III, et\r\nl'Europien\" (1867).\r\n\r\nCaballeria Bonafos, son of Solomon ibn Labe de la Caballeria, was\r\nbaptized in the fifteenth century, and eight brothers followed his\r\nexample. Notwithstanding this, some members of this large family\r\nsuffered much from the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nCarben Victor, a convert, living at Cologne between 1442 and 1515, was\r\nthe author of the following controversial works: (1). \"Opus Aureum ac\r\nNovum in quo Omnes Judaeorum Errores Manifestatur.\" (2). \"Propugnaculum\r\nFidei Christianæ, Instar Dialogi inter Christianum et Judæum in quo quod\r\nJesus verus Messias, verus Deus et Homo, Totius que Humani Generis\r\nSalvator.\"\r\n\r\nCanta Joshua Dei, according to Steinschneider, belonged to the family\r\nCantarini ([Hebrew: mehakhazanim]), and according to Wolf, B. II. i. 131,\r\nhe was a convert to Christianity. He, together with Baptista Vittorio\r\nEliano, denounced the Talmud as containing blasphemies against the\r\nChristian faith, in 1559, and the result was the burning of Hebrew books,\r\nand his own assassination in the streets of Cremona.\r\n\r\nCarthagena don Alfonso, son of Paul of Burgos, died at Burgos in 1456.\r\nHe was baptized together with his father, brother and sister, in 1391,\r\nand became Archdeacon of Compostella, and then succeeded his father in\r\nthe See of Burgos. The writers in the \"Jewish Encyclopædia\" contradict\r\neach other in ascribing the succession at Burgos to both him and his\r\nbrother Alonzo, which cannot be unless one brother succeeded another. In\r\n1431 he was the representative of Castile at the Council of Basel. Pope\r\nPius II., in his memoirs, called him \"An ornament to the prelacy.\" Pope\r\nEugenius IV., hearing that the Bishop of Burgos was about to visit Rome,\r\ndeclared in full conclave, that \"in presence of such a man he felt\r\nashamed to be seated in St. Peter's chair.\" Among Carthagena's writings,\r\non history, morals, and other subjects, there is a commentary on the\r\ntwenty-sixth Psalm, \"Correctus Ludovicius.\"\r\n\r\nCohen Todoros, a native of France, lived at Florence in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. After he embraced Christianity, at the age of fifty, at Geneva,\r\nhe wrote a book entitled \"Maroth Elohim, Liber Visorum Divinum,\" in\r\nwhich he relates the history of his conversion, and quotes passages from\r\nthe Bible and Kabbalistic works in favour of Christianity. The work,\r\npublished in Paris in 1553, was translated into Latin by Angelo Caruni\r\n(Florence, 1554). It is inserted in Johannes Buxtorf's \"Synagoga\r\nJudaica.\"\r\n\r\nCohen, Archbishop of Olmütz, Austria, at the end of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. He wrote many works on Roman law, notably one entitled, in\r\nGerman, \"The Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire from the\r\nStandpoint of Jurists\" (1897).\r\n\r\nCoronel, Paul Nunez, born at Segovia, died in 1534. He was a rabbinical\r\nscholar, and after his conversion he was appointed Professor at the\r\nUniversity of Salamanca. Cardinal Ximenes de Cisneros commissioned him\r\nto translate the Bible into Latin. This translation is contained in the\r\n\"Complutensian Polyglot\" (1541-17). He also wrote \"Additiones ad Librum\r\nNicolai Lirani de Differentiis Translationem (Verborum),\" which has not\r\nbeen printed.\r\n\r\nCrescenzi Alexander lived at Rome in the seventeenth century. In 1666 he\r\ntranslated from the Spanish into Italian Antony Colmenarde Ludesina's\r\ntreatise on \"Chocolate.\" Mandosius speaks of him as a mathematician who\r\nbecame celebrated on account of his report, which he edited with\r\nmathematical notes, on the eruption of Vesuvius in 1660.\r\n\r\nChristiani Pablo, a convert of the thirteenth century. After his baptism\r\nhe became a member of the Order of the Dominicans. He is notorious as an\r\nover-zealous missionary, who cherished the Boanergian spirit more than\r\nthe spirit of Christ towards his brethren, and he is only mentioned here\r\non account of the famous controversy he held at the palace of King James\r\nwith the great Rabbi Nahmonides, when he tried to prove from the Talmud\r\nthe truth of Christianity, and Rabbi Nahmonides declared that he did not\r\nbelieve in the Haggadic stories of the Talmud.\r\n\r\nCompiegne de Weil, Ludwig, lived at Paris, and later at Metz, in the\r\nsecond half of the seventeenth century. He was a descendant of Rabbi\r\nJacob Weil, of Nuremberg. After embracing Christianity he studied\r\ntheology at the Sorbonne. He translated several parts of Maimonides'\r\n\"Yad ha Hazakah.\"\r\n\r\nConrat Mose (Cohen), born in Breslau, 1848, attended there the gymnasium\r\nSt. Maria Magdalena, where he probably embraced Christianity. He was a\r\nprofessor of Roman law at the Universities of Zurich and of Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nDavid Bonet Bonjorn lived in Catalonia in the second half of the\r\nfourteenth century. He is said to have been the son of the astronomer,\r\nJacob Poel. He was baptized in 1391. He had a friend by the name of\r\nPropiat Duran, who was also baptized, but returned to Judaism. P. D.\r\ntried to persuade him to follow his example, but when he refused, the\r\nother addressed an epistle to him under the title, \"Al Tehi Ca\r\nAbothekha,\" which is considered as a masterpiece of satirical criticism\r\nagainst Jewish converts to Christianity.\r\n\r\nDavilla Diego Arias, minister and confident of King Henry IV. of\r\nCastile, died in 1466. He and his family became Christians when Vincent\r\nFerrer was preaching special sermons to Jews, and it is recorded that\r\nthey were generous towards the Church. His second son, Juan Arias\r\nDavilla, was Bishop of Segovia.\r\n\r\nDelegado Gonçalo, a Portuguese convert of the sixteenth century, was a\r\npoet. One poem narrates the circumstances of an English incursion in\r\n1596, during which the town of Faro was stormed and sacked. The poem is\r\ndedicated to Ruy Lourenzo de Tovava.\r\n\r\nDeza, Diego de, was not himself a convert, but of Jewish descent. He was\r\nsecond inquisitor-general, Bishop of Salamanca, Professor of Theology\r\nthere, friend and protector of Christopher Columbus, and finally\r\nArchbishop of Seville, in which city he died in 1506.\r\n\r\nDiego de Valencia, a satirical Spanish poet in the fifteenth century,\r\nafter embracing Christianity, entered the Franciscan Order, and\r\nreceiving the degree of doctor of theology, was known among his\r\ncontemporaries as a very learned physician, astrologer, and master of\r\nsciences (_gran letrado_, _fisico_, _astrologo é mecanico_). He was one\r\nof the leading Valencian poets, and most of his poems are contained in\r\nthe \"Cancionero de Baena.\"\r\n\r\nDominico Irosolimitano, born in Safed, Galilee about 1550, died in Italy\r\nabout 1620. He was educated at the rabbinical college in his native\r\ncity, studying not only the Talmud, but also medicine. After having\r\nobtained the degree of doctor and the title of Rab, he lectured on\r\nTalmudic law in Safed. His fame as a physician spread far and wide, so\r\nthat the Sultan of Turkey summoned him to Constantinople as Court\r\nPhysician. Subsequently he embraced Christianity, went to Rome, and was\r\nreceived at the college of the Neophytes, where he taught Hebrew. He was\r\nthen employed as expurgator of Hebrew books. Dominicus was the author of\r\na Hebrew book entitled, \"Ma'ayan Gannim\" (Fountain of the Gardens), on\r\nthe principles of the Christian faith. He also translated into Hebrew\r\nthe whole of the New Testament, and most of the Apocryphal books\r\n(1615-17). He was the compiler of the \"Sefer ha Zikuk\" (Book of\r\nExpurgation), still in manuscript, one copy of which (in the library of\r\nCardinal Berberini, Rome), shews revision by him as late as 1619.\r\n\r\nDrach David Paul Chevalier, born at Strasburg, in 1791, died in Rome.\r\nDrach was the son of a rabbi, and received a good education from his\r\nfather. In 1823 he embraced Christianity together with his two daughters\r\nand his son Paul, who afterwards became a priest and a distinguished\r\nBiblical scholar. Drach senior accepted the position of librarian of the\r\nPropaganda in Rome. His principal works are the following: An edition of\r\nthe \"Bible de Venice,\" 27 volumes, with copious and learned notes,\r\nParis, 1827, 33; \"Relation de la Conversion de M. Hyacinthe (Simon)\r\nDeutz, Baptisé à Rome le 3 Février,\" 1826; \"Précédée de Quelques\r\nConsidérations sur le Retour d'Israel dans l'Eglise de Dieu,\" Paris,\r\n1828; \"Notice Concernant l'Origine et les Progrès de l'Hospice\r\nApostolique de St. Michel,\" Rome, 1842; \"De l'Harmonie Entre l'Eglise et\r\nla Synagogue, ou Perpétuité de la Foi de la Réligion Chrétienne,\" 2\r\nvolumes, Paris, 1844; \"Lexicon Catholicum Hebraicum et Chaldaicum in V.\r\nT. Libros, hoc est Gulielmi Gesenii Lexicon Manuale Hebræo-Latinum\r\nOrdino Alphabetico Digestum,\" Paris, 1848; \"Le Pieux Hebraisant,\" a work\r\ncontaining the principal Christian prayers, and a summary of the\r\nCatholic Catechism in Hebrew and Latin, _ib._ 1853; \"Documents Nouveaux\r\nsur les Restes des Anciens Samaritains\" (from the Annales de\r\nPhilosophic Chrétienne), Nov. 1853, _ib._ 1854.\r\n\r\nEliano, Vittorio, grandson of Elijah Levita, a convert of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. He became priest and canon. Well versed in Hebrew literature,\r\nhe was appointed censor of Hebrew books, first at Cremona, afterwards\r\n(1567), at Venice. In this capacity he permitted (1557) the publication\r\nof the \"Zohar,\" and edited the \"Tur\" in 1558.\r\n\r\nEskelis, Denis Baron de, and his sister, Countess of Winifen, son and\r\ndaughter of Freiherr Von Bernhard Eskelis, Austrian financier, who was\r\nthe founder of the Austrian National Bank, embraced Christianity in the\r\nnineteenth century. Denis succeeded his father in the management of the\r\nbanking-house.\r\n\r\nFelix Pratensis, born at Prato, Italy, in the second half of the\r\nfifteenth century, died at Rome in 1539. In 1518 he embraced\r\nChristianity, then joined the Augustine Order and devoted himself to\r\nmissionary work among his brethren. He had a perfect knowledge of three\r\nlanguages, and displayed such great fervour, though apparently with\r\nlittle discretion, in his sermons, that he was called \"the Jews'\r\nscourge.\" While still a member of the synagogue, Felix published a Latin\r\ntranslation of the Psalms, entitled, \"Psalterium ex Hebræo ad Verbum\r\nTranslatum,\" Venice 1515. He arranged the Masorah for the \"Biblia\r\nVeneta,\" 1518, published by his disciple Bromberg.\r\n\r\nFerretti Francesco Maria (Abot), whose Jewish name was Sabbathai Nahum,\r\nwas a native of Ancona or had been rabbi there, for he calls himself\r\nd'Ancona. He embraced Christianity in 1734. He wrote a book entitled,\r\n\"La Verita della Fede Christiana,\" Venice, 1741. In this book there is a\r\nprayer in Hebrew and Italian which gives us an insight into his\r\nexperience and life as a seeker after the truth.\r\n\r\nThe prayer is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Creator of the worlds, Lord of lords! It is revealed and known before\r\nthe Throne of Thy Majesty that for many years my heart is restless and\r\nmy spirit is drawn hither and thither, in that the thought occurs to me\r\nto forsake the faith of my fathers and to accept the Christian faith. I\r\ndo not, however, know whether this desire is good, a pure effect of the\r\nworking of the Holy Spirit, which aims at my salvation, and is\r\ndetermined before the Throne of Thy Majesty, that Thy will and pleasure\r\nshould be accomplished in this faith. It is also known unto Thee that\r\njust when I am in the synagogue or in the houses of study, and even in\r\nthe highest festivals when I am engaged in prayer, the desire of\r\nacknowledging the Christian faith inflames my heart and mind to the\r\nutmost. I cannot do otherwise. I must leave my bed in the middle of the\r\nnight, and with bitter tears which Thou wilt not disdain, beseech Thee,\r\nthat on the ground of Thy thirteen attributes, Thou mayest deliver me\r\nfrom these inward vexations. Yet they become stronger and more vehement\r\nevery day, so that I am powerless to overcome them, and in weariness\r\nrepine. No sooner does one thought leave me than another arises; the\r\none whispers this, the other that. I am dumb and without advice. Thou\r\nknowest also that, after I made an excursion and returned home, I felt a\r\nlittle easier, but these thoughts took hold of me more mightily, making\r\nme anxious with fear and dread, and giving me not a moment's rest either\r\nday or night. They pursue me while dreaming or awake, on all my ways, so\r\nthat life is a misery to me. Therefore, O Lord, Thou God of Abraham,\r\nIsaac, and Jacob, who art enthroned over the Cherubim, hear me! O Lord,\r\nhearken unto me! Here I am, here I am! Behold, in fasting and in prayer\r\nI supplicate Thy lovingkindness and grace, that Thou mayest graciously\r\nincline to me from Thy throne of glory and grant my request. O, my God,\r\nteach me to pray humbly and acceptably. Give me a new and pure heart,\r\nand renew my spirit, that I may be enabled to understand the inward\r\nemotions and to perceive the truth. Save me from this tribulation, and\r\nlead me in the right way. If it is determined before the Throne of Thy\r\nMajesty that I should accept the Christian faith, because it is good,\r\nholy, and acceptable to Thee; O, so may it please Thee that I should\r\nwalk about in peace, and not depart from Thy way and will. All things\r\ncome from Thee, and Thou hast dominion over all, and Thou enlightenest\r\nthe eyes of those who love Thee, and Thou accomplishest that which is in\r\naccordance with Thy counsel. When after this month is passed, these\r\nspiritual emotions do not cease, then I will in truth acknowledge that\r\nThou alone from Thy dwelling place in heaven hast wrought this\r\nrestlessness in me, in order to lead me to my soul's salvation. So take\r\nhold of me with Thy right hand, bring my soul near to redemption, and\r\nsave me from mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil, my cup\r\nrunneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of\r\nmy life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. Praised be\r\nThou, O Lord. Teach me Thy statutes. Praised be Thou who hearest prayer.\r\nAmen.\"\r\n\r\nFerrus, Peter, a Jewish convert to Christianity, lived in Spain in the\r\nfifteenth century. He was a poet of ability, but lacked discretion as\r\nwell as charity in his poems with regard to the Jews.\r\n\r\nFranchi, Guglielmo Dei, born in Rome, died there about 1660. After\r\nhaving embraced Christianity he joined the monastic order of\r\nVallombrosa, and devoted himself to the dissemination of knowledge of\r\nHebrew among Christians. In 1596 he published, at Rome, a Hebrew\r\nalphabet (\"Alphabeticum Hebraicum\"), giving the rules for the reading of\r\nHebrew, and three years later a short Hebrew grammar. (Bergamo, 1599.)\r\n\r\nGonzalo, Garcia De Santa Maria, son of Paul of Burgos, was baptized with\r\nhis father in 1379, when he was eleven years old. He was appointed\r\narchdeacon of Briviesca in 1412, and then successively Bishop of\r\nAstorga, of Placentia, and of Siguenza. Besides his ecclesiastical and\r\nhistorical studies, he made himself familiar with Jewish literature, and\r\nwas one of the most learned men of his time in Spain. He was present at\r\nthe Council of Basel as a delegate from Aragon.\r\n\r\nForti, Hortensius (Johanan Hazak), Jewish convert to Christianity, lived\r\nin the sixteenth century, born at Gorima, and settled at Prague, under\r\nMaximilian II. He wrote \"Dikduk Leshon Kodesh,\" a Hebrew grammar,\r\nPrague, 1565-66, and \"De Mystica Literarum Significatione,\" in which he\r\nexpatiates on the different ways of writing the Holy Name. The latter\r\nwork was published by Kircher in his \"Oedipus Aegptytiacus ii.\"\r\n\r\nHeydeck, Don Juan, was before his conversion to Christianity a rabbi in\r\nGermany, and afterwards professor of Oriental languages at the\r\nUniversity of Madrid. In 1792 he published a work in three vols.\r\nentitled, \"Defense de la religion Christiana,\" in which he reputed the\r\nerrors and attacks of Voltaire and Rousseau. This work next to the Bible\r\nwas the means of convincing Dr. Cappadose and Da Costa of the truth of\r\nthe Gospel. In 1807 Napoleon convoked a great Jewish Sanhedrin, when\r\nsome of the delegate rabbis were exuberant in their flattery of him as\r\nif he had been the Messiah. Thus the Italian Rabbi Segri, in an oration\r\nin honour of Napoleon's birthday said: \"Truly a supernatural genius\r\nappeared upon earth, invested with greatness and infinite fame.\" _Et ecce\r\ncum nubibus coeli quasi Filius hominis veniebat et dedit ei potestatem\r\net honorem et regnum_ (Dan. vii. 13). R. David Zinsheimer, of\r\nStrassburg, applied to him in a sermon, Isa. xlii. 1, 4, 6. Another\r\nItalian rabbi opened the sitting with a speech in which this passage\r\noccurs in reference to Napoleon. _Le genie createur, qui parmi les\r\nmortels est le mieux formée à l'image de Dieu, en suit les traces\r\nsublime._ It was then that Heydeck wrote to them, \"If the Son of Man\r\nshall make you free, ye shall be free indeed\" (John viii. 36.) (See\r\n\"Christen und Juden,\" by Dr. A. Fürst, p. 202. See also the \"Missionary\r\nJournal\" of Dr. Joseph Wolf, 1824, containing a letter of Heydeck to a\r\nfriend of Wolf in England, in which he expresses great interest in\r\nWolf's journey to Jerusalem, and asks his correspondent to tell him that\r\nit is his wish that he may become like Joseph in Egypt, a deliverer of\r\nhis brethren according to the flesh.)\r\n\r\nHenekstein, Alfred Freiherr Von, born at Ober Dobling, Austria, 1810,\r\ndied in Vienna, 1882. He was the son of the banker Joseph Von\r\nHenekstein, and embraced Christianity in 1828. Joining the army in the\r\nsame year, he was gradually promoted, until in 1869 he was appointed\r\nChief of the General Staff. As such he acted under Benedek in the\r\nAustro-Prussian war, when the Austrian army, through the blunders of\r\ncommanding officers, was defeated, and he and his superior were arrested\r\nto appear before a court-martial. After some time the court was\r\ndismissed without having given judgment. Leaving the army, Henekstein\r\npassed the rest of his life in retirement in Vienna.\r\n\r\nHess, Ernst Friedrich, lived in the sixteenth century. He was the author\r\nof a controversial book entitled, \"Neue Juden-geissel,\" cited as\r\n\"Flagellum Judæorum.\" (Fritzlar, 1589.) (Strack, \"Sind die Juden\r\nVerbrecher,\" p. 7.)\r\n\r\nIbn Vives, Juan, grandson of one of the richest Jews of Valencia, was\r\nthe author of a book entitled, \"Veritate Fidei Christianæ.\" It is\r\nasserted in the \"Jewish Encyclopædia\" that he did this in self-defence,\r\nbecause he was condemned in 1510 for Judaizing, but no proof is given.\r\n\r\nIolante, a converted Jewess, married Dam Luis, brother of Henry, King of\r\nPortugal, in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nIsaac Johann Levita, born in Germany 1515, died at Cologne, 1577. At\r\nfirst he was a rabbi at Wetzler, he was baptized as a Protestant in\r\n1546, but joined the Roman Catholic Church, and was appointed professor\r\nof Hebrew at Cologne, which office he held until his death. He wrote a\r\nHebrew grammar in 1556. He also edited Maimonides' work on astrology,\r\nand Moses ibn Tibbon's commentary on Aristotle's physics (Cologne,\r\n1555).\r\n\r\nJohannes Hispalensis, flourished between 1135 and 1153. He was a native\r\nof Toledo, and hence also was called J. (David) Toletanus. He was one of\r\nthe earliest translators from the Arabic. He translated chiefly\r\nastrological and astronomical, but likewise some philosophical, and a\r\nfew medical, works, such as \"Fons Vitæ,\" and \"Epitome Totius Astrologæ.\"\r\n\r\nJohannes Pauli, born about 1455, died at Thann, 1530. He became a\r\ndistinguished preacher of the Franciscan Order at Oppenheim and\r\nStrassburg, at which latter place he took notes of Geiler's Sermons,\r\nwhich he edited at Schlettstadt, 1517. He is known chiefly, however, for\r\nhis collection of jests under the title, \"Schimpf und Ernst\" (Thann,\r\n1519). Some of his stories were taken over into the \"Hundred Merry\r\nTales\" used by Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nJohn, of Capua, an Italian Jewish convert in the thirteenth century. He\r\ntranslated Rabbi Joel's Hebrew version of \"Kallilah wa Dimnah,\" from\r\nArabic into Latin, under the title, \"Discetorium Vitæ Humane,\" and his\r\ntranslation was the source from which that work became so widely spread\r\nin almost all European tongues.\r\n\r\nJoshua Halorki was born in Spain in the latter part of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, at Lorca, in Murcia. He early distinguished himself as a subtle\r\nTalmudist and skilful physician. He was a Jew of the straitest sect. His\r\nscrupulous search for arguments against Christianity was over-ruled to\r\nhis discovering that Christianity was founded on the Rock of Ages,\r\nagainst which the very gates of hell could not prevail. Dr. Joshua de\r\nLorca then confessed, publicly, that in assaying to convict the Hebrew\r\nChristian, Solomon Halevi, of heresy, he proved himself to be ignorant\r\nof the spirit, and an unbeliever in the letter, of Moses and the\r\nProphets. He begged for the privilege of being baptized. He assumed the\r\nname, when the sacrament of baptism was administered to him, of Geronymo\r\nà Santa Fé. It was soon made evident that Joshua--or Geronymo, or\r\nHieronymus, as he is variably known in ecclesiastical history--was a\r\nchosen vessel in the hands of his Redeemer. The new Hebrew Christian\r\ndevoted his immense wealth, intellectual and other, towards the\r\npromotion of his Saviour's honour and glory, especially amongst his\r\nJewish brethren. His extensive acquaintance with Talmudical and other\r\nJewish lore, enabled him so to expose their false teaching, as to make\r\ntheir fallacies very evident to such as would not hoodwink their reason\r\nby impervious prejudice. His celebrated work, \"Probationes N. T. ex V.\r\nT. per quas doctrina Talmud improbitur, et dicitur liber contra errores\r\nJudæorum,\" is one of the most decisive testimonies for Christianity, and\r\nagainst Talmudism, which a Hebrew Christian witness could have borne.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1413, an ever memorable conference between Jewish and\r\nChristian divines was agreed upon. The meeting was convened at Tortosa,\r\nin Aragon. The Pope-Pretender, Benedict XIII., or Pedro de Luna,\r\npresided. The most renowned and famous Rabbis of the time were ranged on\r\none side, Geronymo à Santa Fé--assisted by Andreas Baltram, a native of\r\nValencia, another Hebrew Christian, afterwards Bishop of Barcelona--on\r\nthe other side, and they met on the 7th of February, 1413, to discuss\r\nwhether \"Jesus, called of Nazareth, who was born at Bethlehem in the\r\nlatter days of King Herod, seventy years before the destruction of the\r\nsecond temple, who was crucified, and died at Jerusalem, is really the\r\ntrue Messiah, foretold by the prophets of the Old Testament.\" The\r\ndiscussion lasted till Nov. 12, 1414. It occupied sixty-nine sessions.\r\nIt was attended by the grandees of the Church and Synagogue of the day.\r\nThe result was wonderful. All the Jewish disputants, with the exception\r\nof two, admitted, and signed a declaration accordingly, that they were\r\nfairly vanquished, and that utterly. Upwards of five thousand Jews made\r\na public confession of their faith in Christ, and were baptized into the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThere is an account of that conference in a parchment MS., consisting of\r\n409 fols., in Sto. Lorenzo del Escorial, entitled, \"Hieronymi de Santa\r\nFide Medici Benedicti XIII. Processus rerum et tractuum et Europæ,\r\nRabbinorum ex une parte, et Catholicorum ex alia, ad convicendos Judæos\r\nde adventu Messiæ.\" Contemporary Jewish writers are ominously silent\r\nabout it. The story of Joshua Halorki is full of suggestive matter for\r\nserious thought for the Rabbis of modern synagogues, and for Christian\r\nministers of modern churches.\r\n\r\nJohn, of Valladolid, born 1335. An able speaker and acquainted with\r\nrabbinical literature, he persuaded King Henry of Castile that he could\r\nconvince the Jews of the truth of Christianity if they were obliged to\r\nlisten to him and to answer his questions. An order was accordingly\r\nissued, compelling the Jews to attend John's lectures in their\r\nsynagogues and to discuss them with him. In company with another Jewish\r\nconvert, John travelled throughout the Castilian provinces, lectured and\r\ndebated in the synagogues, but with lack of success. At Avilla, he\r\nassembled the Jews four times and discussed with them the tenets of\r\nChristianity before numerous Christian and Moslem audiences. At Burgos,\r\nhe summoned Moses ha Cohen, of Tordesillas, to a religious controversy\r\nin the presence of Archbishop Gomez, of Toledo, but he made no\r\nimpression upon his opponent. Just because he was not content in\r\nbringing arguments from Scripture to prove Christian doctrines, but in\r\nimitation of the rabbinical method, he tried to base a doctrine on the\r\nform of a letter. Thus, for instance, he claimed that the final closed\r\n\"mem\" in the word [Hebrew: lemarbeh] (Isa. ix. 6), is an allusion to the\r\nimmaculate conception.\r\n\r\nLevi Barach (Joseph Jean François Elie), born at Hagenau, Elssas, 1721,\r\nembraced Christianity in Paris, 1752. His wife refused to live with him,\r\nand he refused to divorce her according to Jewish law. He obtained from\r\nthe Bishops of Verdun and Metz canonical opinions that a baptized Jew\r\nmight marry a Christian if his wife refused to be converted with him.\r\n\r\nLevi Ben Shem Job, Portuguese convert, lived at the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. He is identified by some scholars with a certain Antonio, who\r\nwas chief surgeon of King John II., and who wrote a pamphlet entitled,\r\n\"Ajudo da Fé Contra os Judaeos.\"\r\n\r\nMandl Christof, a Hungarian Jewish convert, baptized in 1534. His\r\ngodfather was George, Margrave of Brandenburg, to whom Mandl dedicated\r\nhis tract entitled, \"Dass Jesus sey das Ewig Wort\" (1536). He also wrote\r\ntwo other tracts on the \"Seventy Weeks of Daniel,\" and \"Jesus is the\r\nMessiah\" (1552-7).\r\n\r\nMargarita Antonius, son of Rabbi Jacob Margoliouth, of Regensburg, was\r\nbaptized in 1552, at Wasserburg, Bavaria. He was teacher of Hebrew\r\nsuccessively at Augsberg, Meissen, Zell, Leipzig, and Vienna, where he\r\ndied. His book, \"Der ganze Jüdische Glaub,\" &c., contained among some\r\ngood things, many bad and foolish things, and caused much harm to the\r\nJews and to the author himself. His work was variously received. Luther\r\nmade use of it in his writings. It was praised by Hoornbeek, B.\r\nLuthenes, and Joseph Muller, while Wagenseil (who, as is well known, was\r\nnot very partial to the Jews,) spoke of it less favourably. According to\r\nde le Roi he joined the Roman Church as a Protestant.\r\n\r\nMedici Paulus, a Jewish convert of whom the Roman Catholic Church had\r\nreason to be proud, was a learned theologian and a skilful\r\ncontroversialist against modern Judaism. Of his numerous works may here\r\nbe mentioned: 1. \"Catalogo de Neofiti\" (_illustri_), 1701. 2.\r\n\"Promptuarium Biblicorum Textuum ad Catholicum Fidem confirmandam et\r\nJudaeorum informandam perfidiam\" (1707). 3. \"Dialoghi sacri supra il\r\nvechiv e Nouvo Testamento,\" 41 parts in 21 vols. (Venice, 1731-35). 4.\r\n\"Riti e costumi degli Ebrei confutati\" (Fifth edition, Venice, 1557).\r\nThis work is partly supplementary and partly antagonistic to a similar\r\nwork by the famous Jewish scholar, Leon de Modena.\r\n\r\nMendelson (Sorel) Mendelssohn, youngest daughter of Moses Mendelssohn\r\nthe philosopher, joined the Church of Rome at the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century. She is described as \"a woman of broad interests,\r\nclear judgment, and exquisite manners.\"\r\n\r\nMorasini Giulio (Samuel Ben Nahamias, Ben David, B. Isaac, B. David,\r\nBaal Teshubah) was born at Venice, 1612; died in 1687. He was descended\r\nfrom a wealthy family which traced its ancestry back to Nehemiah. In\r\n1649 he was present at a disputation held in Venice between two Jews\r\n(one of whom was a convert), relating to the \"Seventy Weeks of Daniel.\"\r\nHe then, together with his brother Joseph, decided to embrace\r\nChristianity, and was baptized November 22 of the same year, his\r\ngodfather being Angelo Morasini, whose name he took. He went to Rome\r\nunder Alexander VII., intending to become a Capuchin monk, but was\r\ndissuaded by the Pope. Clement IX. appointed him Hebrew scrittore of the\r\nVatican library, and he taught Hebrew in the Propaganda. He was the\r\nauthor of a work entitled, \"Derek Emunah\" (Way of Faith), Rome, 1683. It\r\nhas as a frontispiece a portrait of the author at the age of\r\nseventy-two, and is preceded by a sketch of his life.\r\n\r\nNachman ben Samuel Halevi, Rabbi of Busk, Galicia. When Mikulski, the\r\nadministrator of the Archbishopric of Lemberg, invited the\r\nrepresentatives of Judaism to a disputation with the Frankists, July 16,\r\n1759, he was one of the Frankist delegates. He afterwards became a\r\nChristian, and took the name of Pietr Jacobski (Gräetz x., 392).\r\n\r\nNola, Menahem (John Paul Eustatius), born about 1570, died at Rome about\r\n1608. Having instructed Thomas Aldobrandino, brother of the Pope Clement\r\nVIII., in Hebrew, he was influenced by him to become a Christian, and was\r\nbaptized in 1568. He was the author of several Italian works, mainly in\r\ndefence of Christianity. \"Sacro Settenario\" (Naples, 1579) is a\r\ncompilation of extracts from the Bible, with an explanation of the\r\nceremony of the opening of the gates in the year of Jubilee. \"Salutori\r\nDiscorse\" (_ib._ 1582) contains nine sermons on various dogmas of\r\nChristianity, including those of the Trinity and the necessity for the\r\ncoming of the Messiah. Some of Nola's works are found in the library of\r\nthe Vatican, among them being commentaries, in manuscript, on\r\nLamentations and Ruth. He wrote also a description of the Hebrew\r\nmanuscripts in that library.\r\n\r\nNunez, Henrique Judae, Portuguese convert, born in Borba, Portugal, died\r\nin 1524. It is asserted that he acted as a spy against his people, and\r\nin consequence was stabbed by two Maranos, disguised as monks. He had\r\nreceived the appellation of Firme Fé, was revered as a saint, and people\r\nascribed marvellous healing power to his tomb.\r\n\r\nVettinger, Edward Maria, born at Breslau, 1808, died at Blaseritz, near\r\nDresden, 1872. In 1828 he embraced Christianity. He wrote many works,\r\ncomprising novels, poems, satires, historical and biographical writings,\r\na complete list of which may be found in the \"Moniteur des Dates,\" vi.,\r\n83, Dresden, 1868. This work may be mentioned here in particular. It\r\ngives short biographical notes of important men (over 1,000,000 in\r\nnumber) from the dawn of history to the date of the completion of the\r\nbook, including living persons.\r\n\r\nPaul de Burgos, called also Santa Maria. His Jewish name was Solomon ha\r\nLevi; born at Burgos 1350, died in 1435. He was the wealthiest and most\r\nprominent Jew of the city, and was thoroughly conversant with the Talmud\r\nand rabbinical literature, and up to his fortieth year he officiated as\r\nRabbi of Burgos. His scholarship and intelligence, as well as his piety,\r\nwon the praise of Isaac ben Sheshet. Abrabanel, in his Commentary on\r\nIsa. xxxiv., calls him a wise man. He embraced Christianity in 1370, in\r\nhis native place, after having studied diligently the O. T., especially\r\nJer. xxxi., the N. T. and the works of Thomas Aquinas. He said later,\r\n_Paulus me ad fidem convertit_. His mother and his children were\r\nbaptized with him, but not his wife, who refused, yet was later\r\nreconciled to him and also baptized. After finishing his theological\r\nstudies at Paris, he was ordained and appointed Archdeacon of Trevino,\r\nand in 1402 became Bishop of Carthagena. Subsequently he became a member\r\nof the regency of Castile and Archbishop of Burgos. He wrote \"Dialogus\r\nPauli et Sauli Contra Judæos sive Sive Scrutinium Scripturarum,\" but his\r\nprincipal work (in 1427) is \"Additiones,\" which consists of addenda and\r\nemendations to Nicolas de Lyra's Postiles on the Bible; also, in his old\r\nage, he composed a \"Historia Universal\" in Spanish verse. As Jewish\r\nwriters assert that ambition and vanity were the motives of his\r\nconversion, I give a short extract from his testament to his son, in\r\norder that the reader may judge whether this charge is justified: \"What\r\nwouldest thou, my dearly beloved son, like best that I should give thee\r\nwhile I am still alive, or leave for thee when I die? What better thing\r\ncould it be than the extension of that knowledge which thou hast already\r\ngained from the Holy Scriptures, and which will strengthen thy\r\nwell-ordered zeal for the Christian truth?\" He then quotes Isa. xxxviii.\r\n19: \"The father to the children shall make known Thy truth,\" and\r\ncontinues: \"I was not learned in my youth, but educated in Jewish\r\nblindness and unbelief. While I learned to know the Holy Scriptures from\r\nunholy teachers, I received the opinions of erring men who obscured the\r\npure letter of the Scriptures with impure devices. But it pleased Him\r\nwhose mercy is infinite to call me out of darkness to light and out of\r\nthe pit into the pure air of heaven; so that it appeared to me as if\r\nscales fell from the eyes of my understanding. I began to seek the\r\ntruth, and to trust no more in myself, and so with a humble spirit I\r\nprayed to God to shew me what appertained to the salvation of my soul.\r\nDay and night I sought help from Him, and so it happened that my love\r\nfor the Christian truth increased, and finally I received strength\r\npublicly to confess the faith which was already in my heart.\" Then after\r\ntelling his son how God had blessed him in raising him to a high\r\nposition of usefulness and dignity in the church, and that he had been\r\non intimate terms with King Henry III. and chancellor of his son, the\r\nRegent of Spain, he intimates to him that, with all this, he had not\r\naccumulated any worldly wealth. _Unum est quod silentio committere non\r\npossumus nobis_ _ex Levitico sanguine descendentibus._ \"One\r\ncircumstance which I cannot pass over in silence is this: that we are\r\ndescendants of Levi, and the promises which were given many centuries\r\nago have been fulfilled--'Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance\r\nwith his brethren, the Lord is his inheritance according as the Lord thy\r\nGod promised him' (Deut. x. 9). Truly God Himself is our inheritance.\r\nChrist is our portion. This, my dearly beloved son, is my testament for\r\nthee, and let it also be thine inheritance, that the Law of the Lord may\r\nbe thy joy, and that thou shouldest meditate upon His Word day and\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\nPaulus of Prague, Elhanan ben Menahem; born in Chelm, Poland, about\r\n1540; died at Prague about the end of the sixteenth century; baptized at\r\nNuremberg, 1556. He wrote several works in German, with Latin titles, in\r\ndefence of Christianity--1. \"Solida et Perspicua Demonstratio de SS.\r\nTrinitate.\" 2. \"Confessio Fidei et Testimonia Scripturæ Sacræ de\r\nResurrectione Mortuorum.\" 3. \"The Book of Jona,\" translated in Hebrew,\r\nGreek, Latin and German. 4. \"Mysterium Novum,\" with a preface of a\r\nHebrew poem consisting of 139 verses, arranged in alphabetical order,\r\nand giving an acrostic of his own name. 5. \"Symbolum Apostolicum.\" It is\r\nasserted that he was twice baptized, or that he relapsed; but as writers\r\nare not in accord with each other, as to dates and places, we may have\r\nour doubts about it.\r\n\r\nPierleoni (of a noble Roman family descended from a Jewish banker of\r\nRome) was baptized in the first half of the eleventh century, and took\r\nthe name of Benedictus Christianus. His son was named Leo, and his\r\ngrandson Petrus Leonis. It is from the latter that the family name is\r\nderived. Petrus was prominent in the liberation of Pope Gelasius II.,\r\nand when Petrus died, his son of the same name was Cardinal, and on\r\nseveral occasions rendered service to the Church. In 1130, this son,\r\nCardinal Pierleoni was elected Pope under the name of Anacletus II.,\r\nwhile the counter party chose Innocent II.\r\n\r\nPonte, Lorenzo da (Jeremiah), born at Ceneda, Italy, 1749; died 1837. He\r\nbelonged to a well-known Jewish family, which had produced the\r\nItalian-Turkish diplomatist, Dr. Israel Congeliano. He embraced\r\nChristianity, assuming the name of Da Ponte, in honour of a Catholic\r\nbishop who was his protector. At an early age he became professor of\r\n_belles lettres_ at Treviso, and published various poems, including a\r\npolitical satire, which led to his exile. He went to England and was\r\nsecretary to the Italian Opera Company in London. Then he went to\r\nAmerica, where he wrote various plays, sonnets, critical essays, and a\r\ntranslation of the Psalms. But his best known work is his extremely\r\ninteresting \"Memoirs,\" which Zuckerman has compared to Franklin's\r\nAutobiography. They indicate that even in his youth he was proficient in\r\nHebrew, and the impress of his ancestry and of his early Jewish studies\r\nhas been discerned by critics of his works and views.\r\n\r\nRaphael, Mark, an Italian Jewish convert, flourished at Venice at the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century. It is said that he was a rabbi\r\nbefore his conversion. He was consulted by Henry VIII. on the question\r\nof the legality, according to Jewish law, of his levirate marriage to\r\nCatharine of Braganza, and was invited by him to England. Raphael\r\naccordingly arrived in London on January 28, 1531 (Calendar of State\r\nPapers, Spanish, i. 335). He decided that such marriage was legal, but\r\nsuggested that the King might take another wife conjointly with the\r\nfirst. Later, he reviewed his opinion by pointing to the object of\r\nlevirate marriage, and contending that as no children had been the\r\nresult of the union, the King must have married his brother's widow\r\nwithout the intention of continuing his brother's line, and consequently\r\nthe marriage was illegitimate and invalid. We have here the picture of a\r\nman whose mind as a Jew was trained in rabbinic quibbles, and as a\r\nRomanist had learned to hold the doctrine of intention.\r\n\r\nRaimuch (Remoch) Astruc, physician of Fraga, in the fourteenth century.\r\nAs an orthodox Jew he visited Benveniste ibn Laki, of Saragossa, and\r\nother prominent Jews; but in 1391 he embraced Christianity, taking the\r\nname of Francisco Dias Corni, and endeavoured to convert his former\r\nJewish friends, among them, En Shealticel Bonfos (Gräetz viii. 85).\r\n\r\nRatisbonne Alphonsi Marie, born at Strassburg in 1812, and died at\r\nJerusalem, 1884. After taking his degree in law he visited Rome, when\r\nprobably he met his brother, who won him for the Church. After passing\r\nthrough the novitiate of the Society of Jesus, he joined the Order of\r\nNotre Dame de Sion. He then went to Jerusalem, founded the Order of the\r\nSisters of Sion there, had a school for Jewish children, and officiated\r\nthere as a priest until his death. He was the author of \"Elevations sur\r\nles Litanies de la Sainte Vierge.\"\r\n\r\nRatisbonne, Marie Thédor, brother of the former, born at Strassburg,\r\n1802; died at Paris, 1884, was also a lawyer before his conversion. He\r\nbecame successively, Professor in the Petit Seminaire, Assistant Rector\r\nof the Cathedral of Strassburg, and Superior-General of the Order of\r\nNotre Dame de Sion, founded by him in thanksgiving for the conversion of\r\nhis brother. Among other works, he published, \"Essai sur l'Education\r\nMorale\" (Strassburg, 1828). \"Histoire de Saint Bernard,\" 2 vols. (_ib._\r\n1841). \"Le Manuel de la Mère Chrétienne\" (_ib._ 186). \"Questions Juives\"\r\n(1868). \"Miettes Evangeliques\" (_ib._ 1872). \"Reponse aux Questions d'un\r\nIsraélite de Notre Temps\" (_ib._ 1878).\r\n\r\nRicius Augustinus, Jewish convert to Christianity and astronomer of the\r\nfifteenth century. He was a disciple of R. Abraham Zacuto, and wrote a\r\nwork on the motion of the eighth sphere, a Latin translation of which\r\nappeared in Paris, 1521. He quotes Ibn Ezra, Abraham ben Hiyya, and\r\nother Jewish authors, and mentions the epoch 1477.\r\n\r\nRiccio Paulo, or Paulus Riccius, was born in Germany, and flourished in\r\nthe first half of the sixteenth century. After his conversion to\r\nChristianity he became Professor of Philosophy in the University of\r\nPavia, subsequently he was physician to Maximilian I. He was a friend of\r\nErasmus, and held a controversy with Eck on astronomical subjects. He\r\nsought the spiritual welfare of his Jewish brethren, and imparted to\r\nChristians much information about Jewish literature. His best known book\r\nis his \"De Posta Lucis R. Josephi Gecatilia\" (Augsburg, 1616), which is\r\na free translation of a part of the Kabbalistic work of \"Sha'a re Orah,\"\r\nby Joseph Gikatila. Jerome Riccio (Hieronymes Riccius), Paulo's son,\r\nsent a copy of the work to Reuchlin, who utilized it in the composition\r\nof his \"De Arte Cabbalistica.\" Riccio relates that he was ordered by the\r\nEmperor Maximilian to prepare a Latin translation of the Talmud. All\r\nthat has come down of it are the translations of the tractates of\r\n\"Berakhoth, Sanhedrin, and Makkoth\" (Augsburg, 1519), which are the\r\nearliest Latin renderings of the \"Mishnah\" known to bibliographers. The\r\nmost important of his works is \"De Cælisti Agricultura,\" a large\r\nreligio-philosophical work in four parts, dedicated to the Emperor\r\nCharles and to his brother Ferdinand (Augsburg, 1541, 2nd ed. Basel,\r\n1597). His \"Opuscula Varia,\" which contains a treatise on the 613\r\ncommandments, a religio-philosophical and controversial work, aiming to\r\ndemonstrate to the Jews the truths of Christianity, and an introduction\r\nto the Kabbalah, followed by a compilation of its rules and dogmas, went\r\nthrough four editions (Pavia 1510, Augsburg 1515, 1541, and Basel 1597).\r\nRiccio wrote about ten other works, all in Latin, on various religious,\r\nphilosophical and Kabbalistic subjects, which appeared in Augsburg in\r\n1546, and were reprinted in Basel in 1599.\r\n\r\nRittangel, Johann Stephanus, controversial writer, born at Forsheim,\r\nnear Bamberg; died at Königsberg in 1652. He first became a Roman\r\nCatholic, but when he found out the serious errors of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch he became a Protestant. He was professor of Oriental languages at\r\nKönigsberg, and issued a number of translations of Hebrew works: one of\r\nthe \"Sefer Yezirah\" (1642); one of the \"Passover Haggadah\" (1644); he\r\npublished also his \"Libra Vertatis\" (Fraenker, 1698); and one of the\r\nearliest translations of Jewish prayers, under the title,\r\n\"Hochfeyerliche Solentäten, Gebete und Collecten Anstalt der Opfer,\r\nnebst andern Ceremonien so von der Jüdischen Kirchen am Ersten\r\nNeuen-Jahrstag Gebet und Abendgebet werden müssen\" (Königsberg, 1653).\r\nHis posthumous work, \"Biblia Veritatis\" was written to substantiate the\r\nclaim that the Targums prove the doctrine of the Trinity. This is also\r\nthe subject of his \"Veritatis Religionis Christianæ.\"\r\n\r\nRosenthal, David Augustus, German physician and author, born at Neisse,\r\nSilesia, 1812; died at Breslau, 1575. In 1851 he embraced Roman\r\nCatholicism and set about to improve the tone of the Catholic press and\r\nthe condition of the Catholics of Silesia. In 1862 he edited the\r\npoetical works of the Roman Catholic mystic, Angelus Silesius, better\r\nknown as Johan Scheffler. Between 1869 and 1872, he published his\r\n\"Convertetenbilder aus dem neinzehnten Jahrhundert\" (4 vols.,\r\nSchaffhausen), or biographical sketches of Jews and Protestants who had\r\nembraced the Roman Catholic faith during the nineteenth century. This\r\nwas arranged according to countries. A supplement of the entire work is\r\nfound in the last volume. The \"Convertetenbilder,\" which went through\r\nseveral editions, is a very important contribution to the history of the\r\nChurch in the nineteenth century, and supplements de le Roi's work,\r\n\"Geschichte der Evangelischen Juden Mission,\" which treats only of the\r\nJews who have joined the Protestant Church.\r\n\r\nSantangel (Sancto Angelos) Luis (Azorias) De, a convert and learned\r\njurist of Calatayad, Spain, died before 1459. He was converted by the\r\nsermons of Vincent Ferrer (probably in 1412, when that missionary was\r\nmost active) and was made magistrate of the capital of Aragon. One of\r\nhis grandsons took part in the discovery of America by lending 17,000\r\nducats towards the expenses without interest.\r\n\r\nSixtus Sinensis, born at Sienna in 1520; died in 1569. After embracing\r\nChristianity he joined the Franciscan Order. By the order of Paul IV.,\r\nSixtus and another convert travelled about the Papal States preaching in\r\nthe synagogues. He was more favourable to the Zohar than to the Talmud.\r\nBesides homilies and mathematical writings, Sixtus was the author of the\r\n\"Bibliotheca Sancta\" (Venice, 1566), a Latin work in eight books,\r\ntreating of the divisions and authority of the Bible. It contains an\r\nalphabetical index and an alphabetical list of the rabbinical\r\ninterpreters of the Bible.\r\n\r\nUgolino Blaisio, an Italian Jewish convert, born about 1700. He is known\r\nfor his \"Thesaurus Antiquitatum\" (34 vols., Venice, 1744-69). In this\r\nwork he reprinted most of the seventeenth century treatises on Jewish\r\nantiquities by Bochart, Bonfrère, Buxtrof, Carpzov, Cellarius,\r\nClavering, Deyling, Goodwin, Hottinger, Huet, Lowth, Opitz, Pfeiffer,\r\nPrideaux, Reland, Rhenferd, Saubertius, Selden, Sigonius, Spencer,\r\nTrigland, Van Til, Wagenseil, and Witsius, besides some from fresh\r\ncontributors, and translating much himself from the \"Midrashim.\" He also\r\nhimself translated the treatises Menahoth, and Zebahim (vol. xxi.)\r\nPesahim, Shekalim, Yoma, Succa, Rosh-Hashanah, Tamid, Megilah, Hagigah,\r\nBezah, Moed Katon, Ma'aseroth, Maaser Sheni, Hallah, Orlah, and Bikkurim\r\n(vols, xvii.-xix.), besides a part of Maimonides' \"Yad-Hazakah,\" and of\r\nAbraham Portaleone's \"Shilte ha Gibborim.\"\r\n\r\nVeil, Ludwig Karl de, a native of Metz, whose father and grandfather\r\nwere rabbis, the latter an author of Hebrew books, embraced the Roman\r\nCatholic faith at the age of 17, when he was a teacher of Hebrew in\r\n1655. It is said that Louis XIII., King of France, compelled him to be\r\nbaptized in Compiègne. At all events, the King and the Queen were his\r\nsponsors. He is also called Compiègne, after the town. He became\r\nafterwards ordinary Royal professor of Oriental languages in the\r\nSorbonne, Paris. Wagenseil, who made his acquaintance in Paris, praises\r\nhim for his modesty as well as for his learning and talents. Ludwig de\r\nVeil translated the first eight tracts of the \"Yad-Hazakah\" of\r\nMaimonides into Latin, adding notes thereto (Paris, 1662-78); also\r\n\"Sefer Hakorbanoth,\" with Abrabanel's introduction to Leviticus (London,\r\n1683). A separate edition of this introduction appeared under the title\r\n\"Hakdamat Abravenl El Sefer Wayikra\" (Amsterdam, 1701).\r\n\r\nVeit, Johann Emanuel was born in Ruthenplan, in Bohemia, in 1789, died\r\nin Vienna in 1876. He was the son of a rich Jew named Benedict (Boruch).\r\nHe studied medicine and philosophy first at Prague and then in Vienna,\r\nin which city he became professor and director in the Veterinary College\r\nin 1819. In the newspaper \"Bohemia,\" he was reported to have given the\r\nreason for his conversion in these words:--\"I went through the Old\r\nTestament, and now I must look into the New.\" And to Döllinger he once\r\nsaid, \"Judaism is the vestibule to the Hall Christianity, and I wanted\r\nto pass from the one to the other.\" Here are some remarks which he made\r\noccasionally in letters to friends with reference to his spiritual\r\ndevelopment and his coming to Christ. Thus he wrote:--\"The time past,\r\nthe near as well as the remote, lies behind me like a series of\r\ndissolving views. I am not in the state to give chronological data, I\r\nknow only that it is a good while ago that a decided direction to the\r\npositive belief took me without my exertion.\" A deeper view is given to\r\nus in the following letter:--\"You do not know the miserable history of\r\nmy life, neither the ways by which the Divine Mercy has conducted me,\r\nnor the unutterable distress incumbent upon me. Nobody did know me,\r\nmyself the least, but the Lord has helped me wonderfully. What can the\r\nworld judge of a poor, contrite old student, full of sinfulness,\r\ncraving only God's love, who has finally prostrated himself, in great\r\nanxiety of heart, at the feet of Jesus, the Crucified, crying, 'O Lord,\r\ndo not cast away from Thee the poor dog which licks Thy feet, although\r\nit stretches still its nostrils to the hideous savours of this world.'\"\r\nHaving such a confession before us, we forbear to search after other\r\ninfluences which may have worked upon his soul. A true Israelite, with\r\nthe humility of the woman of Samaria, he found in Jesus Christ the peace\r\nwith God which neither Judaism, the modernised as little as the\r\nrabbinical, nor the philosophical systems could give him. Of course, he\r\ndesired to confess his belief in Jesus Christ as his Saviour and\r\nRedeemer by baptism, and this he did on May 4th, 1816, in the Church of\r\nSt. Carl, Vienna. Eventually Veit was appointed as Cathedral preacher at\r\nSt. Stephen's and his fervent eloquence drew large crowds to hear him,\r\nand many on bended knees cried out for pardon of secret sins. When in\r\n1840 the Damascus blood accusation affair took place, Veit stood up in\r\nthe pulpit before the whole congregation, lifted up a crucifix, and\r\nswore solemnly that this oft repeated accusation had no foundation\r\nwhatever in fact.\r\n\r\nWolken of Ratisbon, a convert to Roman Catholicism in the second half of\r\nthe fifteenth century. In contrast to Veit, he was an accuser of his\r\nformer co-religionists. Whether this arose from personal spite or from\r\nsuperstition does not matter. His memory is only here preserved as a\r\nwarning to others.\r\n\r\nWolowski, a Polish family in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,\r\ndirectly descended from Osias Tebuat Shor, gave to the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch several members, _viz._, a Jewess named Hayya Wolowski (she had\r\nan excellent knowledge of the \"Zohar\"), Nathan ben Elisha (Michael\r\nWolowski) and his brother Solomon (Lucas Francis Levi Wolowski). They\r\nwere all influenced in favour of Christianity by the Frankist movement.\r\nSome descendants of this family are still living in Galicia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA.\r\n\r\nCONVERTS IN THE \"DOMUS CONVERSORUM\" IN LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject under the above title requires a special paragraph, because\r\nit manifests to us the zeal which English Christians in the Middle Ages\r\ndisplayed with regard to the conversion of the Jews, and that their\r\neffects were richly blessed.\r\n\r\nIn an article in the \"Hebrew Christian Witness,\" 1875, by Christopher\r\nChattoc, of Haye House, Castle Bromwich, Warwickshire, entitled \"Traces\r\nof Early Anglo-Hebrew Christians from Authentic Sources,\" he says:--\"All\r\nour best historians allege that, at the expulsion of the Jews from this\r\ncountry in 1290, about fifteen thousand were expelled. If we compare\r\nthis number with the approximate amount of the then population, it is\r\nsomething considerable, and if we take the present population of the\r\ncountry and compare the number of converted and unconverted Jews at the\r\npresent time, the relative proportion of converted Jews in 1290 would be\r\nat least--say, five hundred. This cannot by any means be considered an\r\nexcessive estimate for men, women and children, as the conqueror is said\r\nto have brought over Jews in great numbers, and they were much favoured\r\nby the three first Norman kings. The 'Domus Conversorum,' or home for\r\nconverts, was established in 1232 (by order of Henry III.), a private\r\none in 1213 in London, and one even much earlier still in Oxford.\" He\r\nthen gives a list of three long pages full of names of clergy and\r\nothers, in which he traces Jewish names anglicized, and refers to quite\r\na number of historical works. This cannot for want of space be\r\nreproduced here. I will only mention that Dr. M. Margoliouth said that\r\nthere were three Kings in Great Britain by the name of Solomon. But the\r\narticle by Rabbi Michael Adler, in the \"Jewish Encyclopædia,\" may be\r\ngiven in abridged form. \"The 'Domus Conversorum' was situated in\r\nChancery Lane and had a Chapel attached to the buildings.[4] A similar\r\ninstitution, on a much more modest scale, having been commenced by the\r\nclergy in 1213. A chaplain was appointed to instruct the converts and a\r\nwarden to attend to their temporal affairs. Each male inmate received\r\n1-1/2d., equal to about 2s. 6d. of the present currency, and each female\r\n1d. During the fifty years that elapsed from the time of the founding of\r\nthe 'Domus' until the year of the great expulsion, about a hundred Jews\r\nin all (?) participated in the benefits of the institution, a small\r\nproportion out of the 1,600 Jews in England. All the expenses of the\r\n'Domus' were borne by the royal treasury, while some of the bishops left\r\nbequests to augment its funds. In addition to these sources of income, a\r\nsmall poll-tax, called 'the chevage,' was levied upon all Jews, above\r\nthe age of twelve, to support their converted brethren. The treasury\r\ngrant amounted annually to £202 0s. 4d. (in present currency about\r\n£4,000). At times this contribution was not forthcoming, and the\r\n'converts' were reduced to sore straits of poverty. In 1271 the King\r\naddressed a letter to the Mayor of London, and to the Warden of the\r\n'Domus' complaining of numerous irregularities in the management of the\r\nhouse; and it was not till the year of 1280, under the custos of John de\r\nSt. Denis, that definite regulations for the control of the institution\r\nwere drafted. The records of the 'Domus' end at the year 1608. As late\r\nas the year 1717 a London converted Jew petitioned King George I. for a\r\ngrant from the funds of the 'Domus.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] The house was taken from a Jew named Herberton.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the method pursued in this work, I give an\r\nalphabetical list of the converts mentioned by name, in the above\r\narticle, as converts in the house:--\r\n\r\n  Arthur Antoc, 1663.\r\n\r\n  Aseti Briasti and his wife, Perota, of France, in the\r\n  14th century.\r\n\r\n  Belager, a rabbi of Oxford, entered the house in 1281.\r\n\r\n  Claricia, a Jewess from Exeter, resided there in 1353.\r\n\r\n  Elizabeth, described as the daughter of Rabbi Moses,\r\n  Episcopus Judæorum, joined the converts in 1339.\r\n  She remained in the house for seventeen years.\r\n\r\n  Edward of Westminster lived there from 1461 to\r\n  1503.\r\n\r\n  Edward Scales, from 1503 to 1527.\r\n\r\n  Elizabeth Ferdinando, admitted in 1603.\r\n\r\n  Elizabeth Baptista, from 1504 to 1532.\r\n\r\n  Elizabeth Portugale, from 1492 to 1538.\r\n\r\n  Fortunati Massa, admitted in 1581.\r\n\r\n  Henry of Stratford, 1416-41.\r\n\r\n  John of Castile, admitted in 1366.\r\n\r\n  John de Sancta Maria of Spain, 1371-1405.\r\n\r\n  John Durdragt of Dordrecht, Holland, 1425-55.\r\n\r\n  John Fernando of Spain, 1487-1503.\r\n\r\n  Katherine Wheteley, admitted in 1532.\r\n\r\n  Mary Crook, admitted in 1532.\r\n\r\n  Martin, son of Henry of Woodstock, 1413-1468, the\r\n  longest period of residence.\r\n\r\n  Nathaniel Menda, from the Barbary States, 1578-1608.\r\n  He was baptized in London by John\r\n  Foxe, the author of \"The Book of Martyrs.\"\r\n\r\n  Philip Ferdinandus, a learned Polish Jew who had\r\n  taught Hebrew at Oxford and Cambridge and\r\n  Leyden, resided and died in the 'Domus' in 1600.\r\n\r\n  Wolfgang, Jacob, from Germany, was admitted in the\r\n  year after the Gunpowder Plot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To be continued, and the next part will give accounts of Jewish\r\nConverts in the Protestant Churches since the Reformation._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCONVERTS IN THE PROTESTANT CHURCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reformation ushered in the time of civil and religious liberty, of\r\nprogress in every department of human activity, of thorough\r\ninvestigation of every branch of learning, of more sympathy with human\r\nsuffering, and of more zeal among enlightened Christians for the spread\r\nof the Gospel among all the nations of the earth. The Jews, as a nation,\r\nwere certainly not unaffected by it. For as the Reformation purged a\r\ngreat part of the Western Church from image worship, superstition, false\r\ndoctrine and papal supremacy, it at the same time removed some of the\r\nobstacles in their way of entering a Christian Church. They could go\r\ninto any of the Reformed Churches and find no images in them, and listen\r\nto the reading of their own Scriptures, to the singing of their own\r\nPsalms, and to sermons which were of a character to awaken and to edify\r\nthem. No wonder that Jewish voluntary conversions to Christianity since\r\nthe Reformation are more numerous than in all the previous Christian\r\nages since the time of the Apostles.\r\n\r\nIn our list we properly place first the name of a Jew who came in\r\ncontact with the pious Count Zinzendorf. The story is given by Professor\r\nF. Delitzsch.\r\n\r\nABRAHAM, a rabbi, met the Count at Romseberg, where the latter took\r\nrefuge when he was expelled from Saxony. After some conversation they\r\ngot attached to each other, so that R. Abraham once invited the Count to\r\ndine with him on the Sabbath. The Count accepted the invitation as\r\nreadily as it was given, and, cutting a slice from the loaf said, \"Tell\r\nme, Rabbi Abraham, if your hospitality is always so ready; has it never\r\nbeen abused?\" \"Never, my lord,\" answered the rabbi. \"I shall not be\r\ntired of giving as long as my hand has something to give. It has been my\r\ncustom from my youth up; and even an apple never tastes as good as it\r\ndoes when I have given a half to one poorer than myself. Besides, the\r\nhabit has been of great service to me.\" He then told him how, one\r\nSabbath day, a rough-looking man came in and asked for alms. Not daring\r\nto touch money on the Sabbath day, he invited him to dine with the\r\nfamily. After the meal the man departed with a gruff word of thanks. Not\r\nlong afterwards Abraham was passing through a forest, when robbers\r\nseized him and nearly killed him, and, while on his knees recommending\r\nhis soul to God, another robber came up and called out, \"Rabbi Abraham,\r\ndo you not know me? A man who fed me when I was hungry shall not die\r\nthus.\" And, thrusting a piece of gold into the old man's hand, he drew\r\nhis companions away with him into the forest, leaving the rabbi to\r\npursue his journey. These two tried men became after this even greater\r\nfriends than before. The Count, like Philip of old, declared unto him\r\nthe Gospel of Jesus Christ. Rabbi Abraham became a believer, attended\r\nthe services of the Moravian Brethren, but remained still unbaptized.\r\nWhen he at last lay on his sick bed, Leonard Dober, one of the Count's\r\nassistants, came to visit him. \"Welcome, dear brother,\" said he, \"at my\r\nlast hour. You sought me for years in the Lord's name, with love and\r\nkind words; and see I have been found. My end is near; so is my\r\nsalvation. Will the Lord accept one who comes to Him at the last hour,\r\neven though he approaches His Throne without the sacrament of baptism?\"\r\n\"Yes,\" said Dober, \"decidedly, as surely as it is written, 'Him that\r\ncometh unto Me I will in no wise cast out!'\" \"Blessed be the Holy One of\r\nIsrael for that word,\" said the dying man. Then he called for his son\r\nZadok and blessed him; and the last word they heard was, \"Hallelujah!\"\r\n\r\nABRAHAMS, Rev. George, Minister of the Regent Street Chapel, London, in\r\nthe first half of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nABRAMSON, a famous medal engraver, born in Potsdam, Prussia, in 1754,\r\ndied in 1811. He was a royal medallist and a member of the Academy of\r\nArts. He wrote on the taste for medals and numismatics, 1801.\r\n\r\nABRAHAMSON, Rev. A. E., B.A., Oxon., Rector of Skilgate, Wiveliscombe. A\r\nconvert of the L.J.S., carrying on occasionally a mission to Jews in\r\nRussia by correspondence.\r\n\r\nADAM, Michael, a convert at Zürich, + 1550, translated into Judæo-German\r\n\"Josephus' War,\" the Pentateuch, the five Megilloth, viz., The Song of\r\nSolomon, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Esther. In this work he\r\nwas supported by Paulus Fagius.\r\n\r\nADLER, Rev. August Carl, a native of Höchst in Hesse Darmstadt, convert\r\nand missionary of the L.J.S. After special training in the Hebrew\r\nMissionary College, he laboured for a short time at Bucharest and at\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Maine, and after 1872 he had the charge of the mission\r\nat Amsterdam, where he laboured with great ability and success. He died\r\nthere September 15, 1907. At his funeral the Mayor of Amsterdam said\r\nthat his life left a lustre which would be a guide to many. He testified\r\nthat Adler had engraven the truth in the hearts of those who knew him.\r\n\r\nADLER, Rev. J., after his baptism, studied at Basel, then in Operative\r\nJewish Converts' Institution. He was a devoted missionary of the Mildmay\r\nMission from its beginning until he died. He was well beloved by all who\r\ncame in contact with him. He translated the New Testament into Yiddish.\r\n\r\nADLER, a brother of the above, did for a time evangelistic work among\r\nthe Jews in the Baltic Provinces. His daughter is now the wife of a\r\nclergyman in Australia.\r\n\r\nADRIAN, of Emden, embraced Christianity in 1607 at Frankfort. He wrote\r\nan hortatory letter to the Jews of Wittenberg in 1609, exhorting them to\r\nrepent and believe in the Saviour.\r\n\r\nADRIANUS, Mathaeus, a convert in Germany, well known to Erasmus. He was\r\nprofessor of Hebrew, wrote an Introduction to the Hebrew language, and a\r\nprayer entitled, \"Hora pro Domino.\"\r\n\r\nAGOSHE, a Falasha convert of the L.J.S. in Abyssinia. He was won to the\r\nSaviour through the instrumentality of Mr. Flad and Mr. Bronkhorst, and\r\nwas baptized with 21 others in 1862. During the imprisonment of the\r\nmissionaries he ministered to their wants by supplying them secretly at\r\nnight with food. After they were released, he went to study at St.\r\nChrischona, in Basel, but the climate did not agree with him. In 1873 he\r\nreturned to Abyssinia and with Samony founded a school at the station of\r\nAsseso, laboured there with great fidelity, and bore testimony for\r\nChrist before all classes. God owned and crowned his labours, for on one\r\nSunday ten Falashas were baptized, amongst whom were some of his\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nALAMY, or Alomy Debtera, another Abyssinian convert of the L.J.S., had\r\nhis sphere of labour at Dagusu.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER, John, an English Jewish convert in the seventeenth century,\r\nwrote after his baptism a book entitled, \"Covenant Displayed,\" in which\r\nhe shewed his brethren that the covenant of God with Israel is only\r\nrealized in Christ Jesus.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER, John, was for many years an agent of the Bible Society at the\r\nCrystal Palace, and did good work there. He laboured also with the\r\nwriter and the late Mr. Mamlock at the Paris Exhibition in 1879. He\r\naccompanied the Rev. Frederick Smith to St Petersburg in 1874, when they\r\nobtained permission to reopen the Mission in Poland. Alexander wrote a\r\nnumber of articles for the \"Scattered Nation\" and for \"Good Words,\" and\r\na book entitled \"The Jews, their Past, Present, and Future\" (London,\r\n1870).\r\n\r\nALEXANDER, Michael Solomon, first Protestant Bishop in Jerusalem,[5]\r\nwas born of Jewish parents in Schönlanke, a small manufacturing town in\r\nthe grand duchy of Posen in May 1799. He was trained in the strictest\r\nand straitest principles of rabbinical and orthodox Judaism. At the age\r\nof sixteen he became a teacher of the Talmud and of the German language.\r\nIn 1820, when in his twenty-first year, he came to England to engage in\r\na similar pursuit, and also to perform the duties of a shochet. At that\r\ntime, as he said, he had not the slightest acquaintance with\r\nChristianity, and did not even know of the existence of the New\r\nTestament. His knowledge of Christ was limited to strong impressions of\r\nprejudice against the Holy Name. Disappointed of a situation in London,\r\nhe settled down as a tutor at Colchester. There the sight of a handbill\r\nof the London Jews' Society, notifying its Annual Meeting, aroused his\r\ncuriosity, and he obtained and read the New Testament. Shortly\r\nafterwards he accepted the post of rabbi at Norwich, and subsequently at\r\nPlymouth, and in 1821 he married Miss Levy of that town. He there, in\r\nthe providence of God, became acquainted with the Rev. B. B. Golding,\r\ncurate of Stonehouse, to whom he gave lessons in Hebrew, and from the\r\nconversations which ensued from time to time, Alexander, after much\r\ninward conflict, almost came to the conviction of the truth of\r\nChristianity. The struggle was now almost heart-rending. He used to\r\nsteal silently down to Stonehouse Church on Sunday evenings, and, under\r\nthe shadow of its walls, would stand riveted to the spot, while he\r\nlistened to the songs of Christian praise, in which he dared not as yet\r\ntake part. His congregation, however, soon got to hear of his leanings\r\nto Christianity, and he was suspended from his duties as rabbi. He now\r\nregularly attended Mr. Golding's ministry, and was eventually baptized,\r\non June 22, 1825, in St. Andrew's Church, Plymouth, in the presence of\r\n1,000 people. His wife, who had been a secret enquirer, unknown to her\r\nhusband, was baptized six months later in Exeter. Owing to Alexander's\r\nposition, his conversion aroused much interest, and proved a great\r\nencouragement to all workers in the cause. He was ordained deacon in\r\nDublin, in 1827, by Archbishop Magee, at a time when the ordination of a\r\nHebrew Christian was of very rare occurrence indeed, and appointed to a\r\nsmall charge in that city. In December of the same year he was ordained\r\npriest by the Bishop of Kildare, and joined the London Jews' Society,\r\nwhich he served as missionary, in Danzig, from 1827 to 1830, and in\r\nLondon from 1830 to 1841.\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] This and following eleven pages are taken from _Biographies of\r\nEminent Hebrew Christians_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting incidents in his work in Prussia was a visit\r\nto his birthplace, and the meeting with his brother, a rabbi to a large\r\ncongregation near Posen. We quote the future Bishop's own words, as\r\nshewing his humbleness of mind, and how fully he had left Judaism\r\nbehind, and entered into the joys of his new faith.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot describe my feelings on finding myself now in Posen, my native\r\ncountry, when I reflect on the wonderful dealings of the Lord with me\r\nsince I left this place nine years ago. I was then a wandering sheep\r\nfrom my Saviour's fold, walking in darkness, and in the shades of death,\r\nignorant of the Lord that bought me. How did He lead me? the blind by a\r\nway that I knew not. My soul doth magnify the Lord, because my spirit\r\nrejoiceth in my God, as my Saviour, especially when I consider I am now\r\nengaged as an humble, but unworthy, instrument to preach the glad\r\ntidings of salvation, and to declare to my brethren, what the Lord hath\r\ndone for my soul. When my prospects of usefulness are dark, I look to my\r\nLord, and say, 'Thy grace is sufficient for me; Thy strength is made\r\nperfect in my weakness.'\r\n\r\n\"The Lord gave me another gracious token of His mercy at Posen. I wrote\r\nto my brother, who is rabbi to the large Jewish congregation twelve\r\nmiles from Posen, informing him of my arrival, and requesting that we\r\nmight have a meeting. I had very faint hopes of his compliance, as he\r\nhad been most bitter against me since my baptism. His letter, however,\r\nexpressed a wish to meet me half way from Posen. I immediately set off,\r\nand had the unspeakable satisfaction of embracing my brother, not as an\r\nenemy, even for the Gospel's sake, but full of brotherly love and\r\naffection, and even giving me credit for sincerity. I stated to him the\r\nGospel, and declared also to him an account of the hope that was in me.\r\nHe acknowledged that he had not given the subject due consideration, but\r\nhe promised he would. He told me what is very important, viz., _that it\r\nis generally expected among the Jews, that the coming generation will\r\nembrace Christianity, and that Judaism is fast dying away_. Time would\r\nnot allow him to be much with us, and we parted, praying together that\r\nthe Lord would open his eyes to behold His glory, as it shines in the\r\nface of Jesus, and that we may both be united in His love, and become\r\nbrothers in Christ.\"[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n[6] _Jewish Expositor_, July, 1828, p. 260.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his work in London, Alexander frequently preached to Jews, and took\r\nan active part in the revision of the New Testament in Hebrew and the\r\ntranslation of the Liturgy into the same language. He held the post of\r\nProfessor of Hebrew and Rabbinical Literature in King's College, London,\r\nfrom 1832 to 1841. In 1840 Professor Alexander's name appeared at the\r\nhead of some sixty names of leading converts from Judaism, who had\r\nsubscribed to a formal \"protest of Christian Jews in England\" against\r\nthe Blood Accusation, or charge against the Jews of using Christian\r\nblood in their passover rites. This was a remarkable document, emanating\r\nas it did from so many who were by nationality Jews, and who had lived\r\nto maturity in the faith and practice of modern Judaism.\r\n\r\nJust at this juncture an event took place which then and since aroused\r\nconsiderable commotion in the religious world at home, the establishment\r\nof the Anglican Bishopric at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nDr. McCaul, to whom the Bishopric was first offered, declined it on the\r\nground that a Hebrew Christian ought to occupy the position.\r\nConsequently, Alexander was selected and consecrated, as first Bishop\r\nof the new See, on Sunday, November 7, 1841, in Lambeth Palace, by Dr.\r\nHowley, Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by Dr. Blomfield, Bishop of\r\nLondon, Dr. Murray, Bishop of Rochester, and Dr. Selwyn, Bishop of New\r\nZealand. A distinguished company was present, including his Excellency\r\nthe Chevalier Bunsen, as representing the King of Prussia; Sir Stratford\r\nCanning, Her Majesty's Ambassador Extraordinary to the Porte; Baron\r\nSchleinitz, Prussian Chargé d'Affaires; the Prussian Consul-General\r\nHebeler; Lord Ashley; the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone; the Right Hon. Dr.\r\nNicholl; Sir Robert H. Inglis; Sir Claudius Hunter, and the Rev. Dr.\r\nAbeken, Chaplain to the King of Prussia. The sermon was preached by Dr.\r\nMcCaul from the appropriate text of Isa. lii. 7, \"How beautiful upon the\r\nmountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that\r\npublisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth\r\nsalvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning the Holy Communion was celebrated in the Episcopal\r\nJews' Chapel by the new Bishop, who preached his last sermon before his\r\ndeparture from England, in the evening, from the appropriate, and, as\r\nsubsequent circumstances proved, pathetic words, \"And now, behold, I go\r\nbound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall\r\nbefall me there,\" &c. (Acts xx. 22-24). On the 13th a farewell meeting\r\nwas held, and an address presented to the Bishop, who with Mrs.\r\nAlexander, the Rev. G. Williams, his private chaplain, the Rev. F. C.\r\nand Mrs. Ewald, and Dr. E. Macgowan, sailed from Portsmouth, on December\r\n7. H.M. Steam Frigate \"Devastation\" was granted for the purpose by the\r\nGovernment. The party arrived off Beyrout on January 14, 1842, and\r\nreached Jerusalem on January 21.\r\n\r\nThe entry of the Bishop into Jerusalem was a unique event in the history\r\nof the Holy City, and was thus described by himself:--\"On Friday evening\r\nwe arrived in the city of our forefathers under circumstances of\r\npeculiar respect and honour.... We formed quite a large body--the\r\nConsul-General (Colonel Rose), with seven or eight of his escort;\r\nCaptain Gordon, and six or seven of the officers of the 'Devastation';\r\nMr. Nicolayson and Mr. Bergheim, who met us at Jaffa, and accompanied\r\nus; Mr. Johns and the American missionaries, with escorts, who came to\r\nmeet us about three miles from Jerusalem; and, at last, the chief\r\nofficers sent by the Pasha, who had himself come to meet us in the\r\nafternoon, but was obliged to return, as night came on, and it was damp\r\n(we arrived about six o'clock), and a troop of soldiers, headed by Arab\r\nmusic, which is something like the beating of a tin kettle. Thus we\r\nentered through the Jaffa gate, under the firing of salutes, &c., into\r\nJerusalem, and were conducted to Mr. Nicolayson's house, where we were\r\nmost kindly and hospitably received, and all felt overwhelmed with\r\ngratitude and adoration.... We had service in the temporary chapel on\r\nSunday last. I preached my first sermon from Isaiah lx. 15; Mr. Williams\r\npreached in the afternoon, and Mr. Nicolayson conducted a German\r\nservice in the evening. We had a very good congregation, all our\r\nfriends, the Consul-General, Captain Gordon, and the officers, being\r\npresent. Our feelings on the occasion can be better imagined than\r\nexpressed, as you may easily suppose. We also had the Sacrament, and it\r\nwill be pleasing to the ladies of Reading to know, that the handsome\r\ncommunion-service which they presented to the church was made use of for\r\nthe first time by the Bishop of Jerusalem.\"[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] _Jewish Intelligence_, 1842, p. 127.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Times_ contained a full account of the Bishop's entry, and\r\nconcluded with these words:--\"The Mission is sure of the firm support of\r\nthe British Government and the British Ambassador at the Porte. As\r\nregards Syria, the Consul-General has lent all the force of his official\r\nauthority, personal influence, and popularity, to set the undertaking\r\nafloat, while the mild and benevolent character of the Bishop, and the\r\nsound practical sense and valuable local experience of his coadjutor,\r\nMr. Nicolayson, are sure guarantees that caution, charity, and\r\nconciliation will preside at all their efforts.\"\r\n\r\nIn conformity with instructions received from Constantinople,\r\nproclamation was made in the mosques, that \"he who touches the Anglican\r\nBishop will be regarded as touching the apple of the Pasha's eye.\"\r\n\r\nThe presence of the Bishop was soon felt in work amongst the Jews in\r\nJerusalem. The daily services held in the temporary chapel on Mount Zion\r\nwere a source of much delight to him, and also the large congregations.\r\nThe Bishop thus summed up his episcopal duties for the first year: \"We\r\nhave had every ordinance of our Church performed in our chapel.\" The\r\nBishop had held his first ordination on March 17, had baptized a Jew on\r\nWhitsun Day, and confirmed eight Hebrew Christians; married two\r\nconverts; finishing up with the ordination of a Hebrew Christian\r\nmissionary. The upper room proved all too small, and the building of the\r\nLondon Society's permanent church, which was to serve the joint purposes\r\nof a Cathedral, a chapel for British residence, and a mission centre,\r\nwas proceeded with, although Alexander did not live to see its\r\nconsecration. His episcopate was destined to be a very brief one, but\r\nits three years may well be described as \"years of plenty.\" His letters\r\nshew how ardently he threw himself into his work, and how very near his\r\nheart it was. Outlying districts of his extensive diocese were visited;\r\nand the outlook was bright and promising.\r\n\r\nA great blow fell upon the work in the autumn of 1845, in his sudden\r\ndeath, on Nov. 26, after the short episcopate of four years. The sad\r\nevent occurred in the desert at Ras-el-Wady, on his way to visit Egypt,\r\nwhich formed a part of the diocese of Jerusalem. A pathetic interest\r\nattaches to the Bishop's last annual letter, written before he started\r\nfor Cairo, in which, speaking of his arrangements, he alluded to the\r\n\"uncertainty of everything.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the past he spoke with conscious satisfaction of the Divine\r\nblessing resting upon the work of Jewish converts baptized and\r\nconfirmed, and amicable intercourse maintained with Jewish residents and\r\nstrangers in Jerusalem, of opportunities at Jaffa, of his visit to\r\nDamascus, and of friendly relations maintained with the different\r\nchurches. He thus concluded: \"On the whole we have great reason to thank\r\nGod and take courage, and to call upon our friends to join with us in\r\nprayer and supplication with thanksgiving, on the memorable day, January\r\n21, when we made our first entry into the Holy City. A day which is much\r\nto be remembered, even when the results, which have already followed in\r\nthis short period, be alone taken into consideration; but a day which we\r\ntrust will yet prove one of the most remarkable in the history of the\r\nChurch, when the Lord 'shall build up Zion, and appear in His glory,'\r\nand when all, who now mourn for her, seeing her desolate and trodden\r\ndown, shall rejoice for joy with her; and when God's people shall be\r\ndelighted with the abundance of her glory.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Alexander thus described the Bishop's last days in the desert at\r\nBelveis, Nov. 3, 1845: \"On setting out through the desert, each day my\r\nbeloved husband and myself rode our own horses; we generally were in\r\nadvance of the caravan, and we used regularly to chant some of our\r\nHebrew chants, and sang the following hymns: 'Children of the Heavenly\r\nKing;' 'Long has the Harp of Judah hung;' Psalm cxi.; 'Glorious things\r\nof thee are spoken;' all out of our own hymn-book; and never did his\r\nwarm and tender heart overflow so fully, as when he spoke of Israel's\r\nfuture restoration. When I spoke to him about his duties in England, he\r\nanswered, 'I hope, if invited, to preach my first sermon in England at\r\nthe Episcopal Jews' Chapel;' and on my asking what subject he would\r\ntake, he replied, 'I shall resume the subject I adopted when I last left\r\nthat dear congregation;' namely, that none of these trials had moved\r\nhim. (Acts xx. 24-28.)\"\r\n\r\nHis chaplain, the Rev. W. D. Veitch, reporting the death, said: \"It was\r\ntruly a heart-rending scene. In a tent, in the wild sandy desert, no\r\nmedical help at hand, to see the widowed wife and fatherless daughter\r\nbending over the lowly pallet, on which were stretched the lifeless\r\nremains.\"\r\n\r\n\"The immediate cause of death,\" wrote Mrs. Leider, who formed one of the\r\nparty, \"was rupture of one of the largest bloodvessels near the heart;\r\nbut the whole of the lungs, liver, and heart, were found in an\r\nexceedingly diseased state, and had been so for a length of time; the\r\naccelerating cause, doubtless, was great and continued anxiety--such as\r\nthe Bishopric of Jerusalem and its cares can best account for. I heard\r\nit said on this occasion that had his lordship not come into the East,\r\nhe might possibly have lived to a good old age; but the mitre of\r\nJerusalem, like the wreath of our blessed Lord, has been to him a crown\r\nof thorns.\"\r\n\r\nThe body was taken first to Cairo, where Mr. Veitch preached the funeral\r\nsermon from the most appropriate text that could have been chosen--\"So\r\nMoses, the servant of the Lord, died there in the land of Moab\" (Deut.\r\nxxxiv. 5).\r\n\r\nOn December 6, a mournful caravan set out from Cairo with the Bishop's\r\nremains, recalling the sad procession which returned to the Promised\r\nLand with the bones of Joseph. The cortège arrived at Jerusalem on the\r\n20th of the same month, at seven o'clock in the evening, and proceeded\r\nat once to the English cemetery, where, by torchlight, the remains of\r\nthe beloved and venerated prelate were deposited in their last resting\r\nplace, the Rev. J. Nicolayson reading the service. Funeral sermons were\r\npreached by him in Jerusalem the next day, and in the Episcopal Jews'\r\nChapel, London, on December 28, by the Rev. J. B. Cartwright.\r\n\r\nA letter of condolence to Mrs. Alexander, signed by thirty-one Jewish\r\nconverts at Jerusalem, was the most eloquent testimony to the blessing\r\nwhich had followed the successful labours of the Bishop. The signatories\r\nsaid: \"Next to yourself and your dear family, we consider ourselves the\r\nchief mourners; for we feel both collectively and individually that we\r\nhave lost not only a true Father in Christ, but also a loving brother\r\nand a most kind friend. The suavity and benignity of his manner, which\r\nso greatly endeared him to all, and which gained him the highest and\r\nmost entire filial confidence of every one of us, tend much to increase\r\nthe keen sense we feel of our loss. The affectionate love he bore to\r\nIsrael, which peculiarly characterised him, could not fail to render him\r\nbeloved by every one who had the privilege of being acquainted with him:\r\nwhile his exalted piety, and most exemplary life and conversation,\r\ninspired the highest reverential esteem. He was a burning and a shining\r\nlight; and when he was raised to the highest dignity in the Church, he\r\nconferred the most conspicuous honour on our whole nation, but\r\nespecially on the little band of Jewish believers. With him captive\r\nJudah's brightest earthly star has set, and the top stone has been taken\r\naway from the rising Hebrew Church.\"\r\n\r\nWe do not think that any more expressive words of the sterling quality\r\nof the Bishop's character could have been penned than these. And yet we\r\nshould like to supplement them.\r\n\r\nMany friends testified their love and esteem for the Bishop by raising a\r\nmost gratifying testimonial to his memory, amounting to over £3,000,\r\nwhich was handed to his widow and family. It is interesting to glance at\r\nthe list of contributors after this lapse of time, for it reveals the\r\nfact that the Bishop was highly esteemed by rich and poor alike. Amongst\r\nthe former we notice the names of the Dowager Queen Adelaide, the then\r\nArchbishops of Canterbury and Armagh, and the Bishops of London,\r\nWinchester, Ripon, Lichfield, Lincoln, Peterborough, Llandaff, Sodor and\r\nMan, and Madras. The Primate of All England spoke of Alexander having\r\nconducted the affairs of his Church with so much discretion and\r\nprudence, as to give no cause of complaint to the heads of other\r\ncommunions residing in the same city, and to win their respect and\r\nesteem by his piety and beneficence, and by his persevering yet\r\ntemperate zeal in prosecuting the objects of his mission.\r\n\r\nHe lived and worked in constant dependence upon the Holy Spirit whose\r\npower he conspicuously honoured. It was his invariable practice to\r\nimpress upon those whom he was about to teach the absolute impossibility\r\nof their understanding divine things without His aid. This was as\r\nnoticeable in his earlier years as missionary, as in his later ones as\r\nbishop. His conciliatory manner in dealing with Jews, his transparent\r\nlove for his brethren, his calmness amidst opposition, did much to\r\ndisarm the excited assembly at the Conferences in Aldermanbury, and the\r\nviolent attitude of the mob when he revisited his Jewish relatives at\r\nSchönlanke. He was bold and fearless in the delivery of his message,\r\nfaithful in everything, anxious above all things to bear testimony to\r\nthe name and glory of his Master, and to make full proof of his\r\nministry, whether as missionary or bishop.\r\n\r\nHis friends, and those who worked under him at Jerusalem, loved him for\r\nhis kind nature--for he had an ear, heart, and purse open to all--and\r\nfor his simple-hearted piety. He was an Israelite indeed in whom there\r\nwas no guile. He had a ripeness of Christian experience, and unaffected\r\nearnestness of purpose. His was a strikingly interesting personality,\r\nrendered doubly so in that he was a Hebrew of the Hebrews, and in his\r\nepiscopal dignity a link with the primitive Hebrew Christian Church in\r\nthe Mother City of Christendom.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop published: \"The Hope of Israel,\" 1831; The \"Glory of Mount\r\nZion,\" 1839; \"The Flower that Fadeth,\" \"Memoir of Sarah Alexander,\"\r\n1841.\r\n\r\nALEXANDERSON, Daniel, was baptized in Holland in 1621. He published in\r\nthe Syriac (rabbinic) language a confession of faith, to which he\r\nappended an epistle to the dispersed Jews, asking them to accept Jesus\r\nas their Saviour. This was translated into Dutch, German, and French by\r\nPetrus Jacobi, (Amsterdam, 1642).\r\n\r\nALMAN, Rev. S., a minister of the Gospel in New York.\r\n\r\nALTHAUSEN, Dr., son of a well-known rabbi in Russia. After studying\r\nmedicine at Lemberg he was appointed as military doctor in Russia. At\r\nthe age of 35 he was converted and baptized by Pastor Landesen, in\r\nCharkow, in 1855, and his wife and children followed his example a year\r\nor two afterwards. He then devoted himself to missionary work in St.\r\nPetersburg and in other cities, and did good work, notably in spreading\r\nthe New Testament which was plentifully supplied to him by the late Rev.\r\nJohn Wilkinson, of the Mildmay Mission.\r\n\r\nALTMANN, J., a convert of the L.J.S., baptized by the Rev.

He was\r\ninstructed by Goldinger of the L.J.S., and was baptized in Poland in\r\n1848.\r\n\r\nAMSDEN, of Vermont, a convert and missionary to the Jews in the United\r\nStates about 1850.\r\n\r\nANGEL, Rev.

It was there when reading Dan. ix. that he began to\r\nthink seriously as to the state of his soul. On his return to Germany he\r\nwas baptized at Wolfenbuttel by Pastor Meyers in 1748. The Duke of\r\nBrunswick appointed him Professor of Hebrew at Helmstadt. He wrote a\r\nLatin tract, \"The Wandering Jew,\" entitled \"Commentatio Historica de\r\nJudæo Immortali in qua haec Fabula examinatur et confutatur,\" Helmstadt,\r\n1756; translated Abraham Jaegel's Catechism, \"Lekah Tob\" (Good\r\nInstruction), Brunswick, 1756; and gave a description of a rare copy of\r\n\"Shulhan Aruk Eben haezer,\" to be found in manuscript in the City\r\nLibrary, Hamburg. He also wrote \"Fabulae Antiquitatum Ebraicum Veterum,\"\r\n&c., Brunswick, 1756. Also \"Sammlung Einiger Rabbinischer Oden Nebst\r\nEiner Frayen Uebersetzung, Kurzer entworf Jüdescher Gebräuche\r\nAkademischer Vorlesungen entworfen,\" three parts, Brunswick, 1752-1754.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to his book, \"Wahre Gründe, welche Einen Juden Zur wahren\r\nBekehrung, oder zum Heilande der welt Jesu Christo führen Können,\" he\r\nutters the following fervent prayer:\r\n\r\n\"At the conclusion of my work, I humbly invoke the righteous and\r\nmerciful Father, that He may enlighten all Israel with the light from on\r\nhigh, that they may with a pure heart acknowledge Jesus as the only\r\nmeans of their future life. O that they might see in the stem of Jesse\r\nthe tree of life, and be inflamed with love to Him by the Omnipotent\r\nSpirit! O that they might at last acknowledge the Son of Mary as the\r\nfountain of salvation out of which they can draw grace for grace! O that\r\nthey might seek a refuge in the long ago appeared Lion out of the tribe\r\nof Judah, who has destroyed the dominion of Satan and restored eternal\r\npeace! O that they might kiss with lips and heart the glorified Son whom\r\ntheir fathers so carelessly rejected, but who has become the precious\r\nCornerstone, who after achieving His triumph ascended to sit at the\r\nright hand of the Father and praised by the whole host of heaven. O\r\ntriune God, open thou their eyes, that they may see.\" (\"A Fürst.\r\nChristen und Juden,\" 163).\r\n\r\nPastor de le Roi mentions a rumour that Anton at last relapsed into\r\nJudaism, but this must have arisen because he defended Jacob Emden and\r\nhis former teacher Eibenschutz in their dispute with Waggenseil. Dr. S.\r\nA. Hirsch, Professor in Jews' College, London, who wrote the article in\r\nthe \"Jewish Encyclopædia\" and referred to Grätz, does not give a\r\nsyllable about Anton's relapse.\r\n\r\nARGAWI, M., convert and leading missionary of the L.J.S. in Abyssinia.\r\nHe has laboured there for many years amidst great hardships and even\r\namidst martyrdoms of his believing brethren. (See the little tract,\r\n\"Martyrs of Jesus.\")\r\n\r\nARIAS, E. P., missionary of the L.J.S. at Rome for many years.\r\n\r\nARNHOLD, Siegfried Heinrich, D.Ph., embraced Christianity at Berlin in\r\n1854. He was Professor of the Polytechnic in that city, and died as such\r\nin 1884.\r\n\r\nASSING, David Assur, born at Königsberg, 1787, died 1842, was baptized\r\nin 1815. He was physician and poet; served first in the Russian and then\r\nin the Prussian army. He wrote a treatise entitled, \"Materiae\r\nAlimentariae Leneamenta ad leges Chemico-Dynamicas Adumbrata\" (\"Food and\r\ntheir Relation to Chemical-Dynamical Laws.\") This was published at\r\nGöttingen in 1809.\r\n\r\nASSER, M. E., a convert, councillor at the Ministry of Justice in\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\nAUGSBURGER, Emmanuel, baptized by Gottheil at Stuttgart in 1852, a\r\nfirst-fruit of the mission there. Though only a working weaver by trade,\r\nhe accomplished much good by his voluntary testimony and by his\r\nexemplary life. (See _Jewish Herald_, 1853 and 1886).\r\n\r\nAUGUST, Jacob Michael, baptized with his wife and children in\r\nGreifswald, Germany, about 1723. He became Lector (reader) of Oriental\r\nlanguages at the University of Leipzig.\r\n\r\nAUGUSTI, Friedrich Albert (Joshua), was born at Frankfort-on-the-Oder,\r\n1691. He was the son of Joshua ben Abraham Eschel and Rebecca Pinto,\r\ndescendants of a Venetian family. When he was only seven years old he\r\nshewed already great talents for learning, and delivered a sermonette at\r\na wedding, so that a savant present remarked: \"This boy will be a\r\nteacher in Israel.\" But as a precocious child he had to be guarded\r\nagainst mischief. Once he nearly lost his life while bathing. After the\r\ndeath of his father, Augusti, having read a book which described the\r\nglory of Jerusalem, felt a great desire to go there, and it soon so\r\nhappened that a Jerusalem delegate, Aron Bar Jekutiel, arrived at\r\nFrankfort, and offered to take him with him. The mother, after some\r\nresistance to the boy's entreaties, finally gave her consent and parted\r\nwith him in sorrow. The two travellers went first to Russia, intending\r\nto go by the Black Sea to Constantinople and then to Jerusalem. In the\r\nCrimea a band of robbers overtook them at a lonely spot, and Augusti was\r\ntaken captive, while his companion managed to escape. The robbers\r\nbrought him to a town and sold him as a slave for three and a-half\r\ndollars. After severe trials on board a ship, where he was tempted to\r\nembrace Mohammedanism, the slave dealer sold him to a Mohammedan Jew by\r\nthe name of Ismael Bathmag, who brought him to Smyrna. Here the Jewish\r\ncommunity purchased his freedom from slavery for 100 dollars, and after\r\nsix months sent him home. On his homeward journey he stopped at\r\nKaminice, where he was dangerously ill with cholera. After his recovery\r\nhe eventually came to Cracow, where he remained four years studying\r\nlanguages. From thence he went to Prague and devoted himself to the\r\nstudy of Jewish theology under Rabbi Gabriel, who conferred upon him the\r\ntitle of Morenu, D.D. He then interpreted the famous grammarian, Binyan\r\nShelomo. Returning to Frankfort, he saw his mother, who desired him to\r\nget married and settle down, but he felt impelled to go to Italy in\r\norder to study Kabbalistic lore there. While living in Sonderhasen, in\r\n1720, he was maltreated by a gang of robbers, who broke into the house\r\nin which he resided, and robbed him and his landlord to the amount of\r\n20,000 dollars. It then so happened that a member of the princely family\r\nof Schwarzburg died, when the Court Jew Wallich, in expressing his\r\ncondolence with the reigning prince, used the expression \"der hochselige\r\nPrinz\" with reference to the deceased. Whereupon the prince charged him\r\nwith flattery, as he did not think that the Jews believed that a\r\nChristian could be saved. Wallich then brought Augusti, who proved from\r\nthe \"Sefer Hasidim\" that a pious Christian who keeps the seven Noachian\r\nCommandments has a share in the world to come. This incident was in the\r\nprovidence of God the first means in Augusti's conversion. On that\r\noccasion Dr. Reinhardt, an evangelical pastor, was present, and they\r\nbecame acquainted with each other. This led later to discussions about\r\nthe interpretation of Isaiah liii. Augusti, after much searching in\r\nJewish commentaries, was convinced that this chapter speaks of a person\r\nand that Jesus is the one in whom it was fulfilled. Before his baptism\r\nhe made an open confession in the synagogue of his faith in Christ, and\r\nhe was baptized on Christmas Day, 1722, in the presence of Prince\r\nGunther and the whole court officials. After his baptism he delivered\r\nan address on Ps. ix. 2, in which he expressed his thanksgiving for\r\nGod's wonderful dealing with him. Soon after he began to study theology\r\nat the Seminary of Gotha. In 1727, he went to Jena, and afterward to\r\nLeipzig. He was appointed Assistant Professor of the Gymnasium at Gotha,\r\nin 1729, and in 1734 became minister of the parish of Eschberge, in\r\nwhich position he remained until his death. The famous theologian,\r\nJohann Christi Wilhelm Augusti, was his grandson. Augusti published\r\nseveral works in Latin and German, notably \"Das Geheimnis des\r\nSambathian.\" (\"The Mystery of the Sambathian,\" a fabulous river\r\nmentioned in the Talmud, which casts stones during six days in the week\r\nand rests on the Sabbath.) He also published a work on the Karaites.\r\n\r\nBABA, M. D. M., a convert of the L.J.S. in Persia.\r\n\r\nBACH, Daniel Friedrich, born in Potsdam, 1756, died in 1830, studied in\r\nthe Art Academy of Berlin. The year of his embracing Christianity is not\r\nmentioned. He became a famous painter. (Brockhaus Conv. Lex. I. 99).\r\n\r\nBACHERT, Rev. S. T., A.K.C., convert and missionary of the L.J.S. After\r\nhis ordination he was curate of St. Matthew's, Marylebone, St. John's,\r\nKilburn, and St. Michael's and All Angel's, South Hackney, London. He\r\nwas appointed as head of the mission in Hamburg in 1874, where he\r\nlaboured with evident divine approval for about a quarter of a century.\r\nHe was the founder of a home for enquirers, with a workshop, as well as\r\nof a chapel attached to it, where the inmates studied, worked, lodged,\r\nworshipped, and were under a well-organized Christian training. A very\r\nlarge number found eternal peace there, and quite a considerable number\r\nbecame ministers and evangelists of the Gospel. Bachert was afterwards\r\npromoted to be the Head of the Missionary Training College in London,\r\nand when this was given up, he was sent to take charge of the mission in\r\nthe north of England. The story of his conversion is a very pathetic\r\none.\r\n\r\nBAFFRAL, James, a prolific statistical writer, baptized at Strasburg on\r\nChristmas Day, 1859; his wife (_née Levy_) and five children two years\r\nlater. The relations, after the death of the father, tried their utmost\r\nto bring the children back to Judaism, and they appealed to the law of\r\nthe land, but failed. One of the daughters afterward became\r\nsuperintendent of the Deaconesses' Institution.\r\n\r\nBALAGHI, F., Professor of Theology in Hungary, was a pupil of Theodor\r\nMeyer when he was stationed at Prague.\r\n\r\nBAHN, Martin August, a Berlin Jewish student, embraced Christianity when\r\nhe was under the teaching and influence of Schleiermacher, in 1837.\r\n\r\nBAHRI, Rev. Joseph, convert of the British Society at Stuttgart;\r\nlaboured for several years as missionary of the L.J.S. at Vienna, and\r\nthen as curate to Bishop Billing in the Parish Church of Spitalfields,\r\nand then curate of Hoby and Rotherby where he died at the age of 43. He\r\nwas a spiritually-minded man and a fervent preacher, and cherished\r\nboundless love for his nation.\r\n\r\nBALLIN, Josef, a well-known historical painter, a native of Weener,\r\nOstfriesland, was baptized by Pauli of the L.J.S. when stationed at\r\nBerlin about 1843.\r\n\r\nBARNETT, Henry. The following is his own account of himself:--\r\n\r\n\"For twenty years I lived with my parents in a small town in Poland,\r\ncalled Konin. These years were entirely spent in the study of tradition\r\nand religion, as it had been my father's desire to preserve 'law and\r\nreligion' for the youngest of his family, the other members following in\r\nthe pursuit of business. In those years I knew not the nature of sin.\r\nThe New Testament I never saw with my eyes; such words as the 'gospel'\r\nand 'missionary' were not at all in my vocabulary. I was going on with\r\nthe religion of my fathers in pride and conceit, yet weeping over sin\r\nand pleading for mercy and pardon, though I did not know how hideous sin\r\nwas in the sight of God, neither did it ever enter my mind to ask myself\r\nwhether I obtained those things I so earnestly sought for from God.\r\nSatisfied with the religious duties of my life whilst sin was doing its\r\nwork, and priding myself in being engaged in a higher capacity than the\r\nmere ordinary trade or business man of the Jewish community. When I was\r\nabout twenty-one years of age I left my home to avoid military\r\nconscription. Before I left I prepared myself for occupying a position\r\namong the Jews as a 'slaughterer' in connexion with the synagogue. I did\r\nnot succeed in this, not being a good singer for conducting public\r\nprayers. Reaching London, there seemed only one thing to do, viz., to\r\nlearn a trade in order to maintain myself. Whilst learning a trade\r\namongst my Jewish brethren I also learned 'Sabbath-breaking,' gradually\r\ngave up the morning and evening prayers, and went more and more into\r\nsin.\r\n\r\n\"In a wonderful way the Lord brought me under the influence of the\r\nGospel. On the voyage from Hamburg to Hull I met with a Jew who\r\nprofessed Christianity. I met him about six months later in London, and\r\nmade occasional calls upon him. While I was doing this my heart went\r\noften up to God to deliver me from taking a wrong step. I only knew then\r\nthe opinion of Jews regarding the Jewish missionary and his enterprises.\r\nI felt then that whatever the man himself might be, what he proclaims\r\nwas not to be despised, and I attended the Gospel meetings at spare\r\ntimes with a kind of double feeling. I began to read the New Testament,\r\nand 'faith came by hearing' before two years (1873) expired after my\r\nbeing under the sound of the Gospel. I knew that I was a sinner,\r\naccording to Psalm li. I learned the meaning of Ezekiel xxxiii. 13. I\r\nfound the true Messiah of Isaiah liii., and understood that Christ died\r\n_for me_. I 'believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and was saved' (Acts xvi.\r\n31). Since 1882 I have been enabled, like Saul of Tarsus, to cry, 'Lord\r\nwhat wilt Thou have me to do?' (Acts ix. 6).\"\r\n\r\nBARON, Rev. David, was likewise for many years in the Mildmay Mission\r\nand companion to Barnett in his travels. He is the founder of the\r\nMission under the title, \"Hebrew Christian Testimony for Israel.\" He is\r\nknown as a good expositor of Scripture and is author of several books\r\nrelating to the Jews.\r\n\r\nBARTHOLDY, Jacob Levi Salomo, was uncle on the mother's side to Felix\r\nMendelssohn born, in Berlin, 1779, died in Rome, 1826. He became a\r\nmember of the Protestant Church in 1805, and through his influence the\r\nwhole Mendelssohn family became Christians. He served as an officer in\r\nthe Prussian army, and in 1815 he was appointed consul-general in Rome.\r\nHe wrote treatises on modern Greek, a description of the Terolese war,\r\nand \"Traits from the life of Cardinal Consalvi.\" The Berlin Museum\r\npossesses his collection of antiquities, comprising Etruscan vases,\r\nbronzes, ivories, majolicas, etc., which are now displayed in the\r\nNational Gallery.\r\n\r\nBASEVI, George Joshua, architect, followed the example of his\r\nbrother-in-law Isaac Disraeli, in leaving the synagogue in 1817. But it\r\nmust be stated that no writer expressly asserts that either of the two\r\nwere received into the Church by baptism. This is known, that Basevi\r\nwhile inspecting the bell-tower of Ely Cathedral fell and was killed\r\ninstantly, and then received Christian burial in the chapel at the east\r\nend of the Cathedral.\r\n\r\nBASSIN, Eliezer, born about 1840 in the government of Moghilev, Russia.\r\nIn 1869 he went to Constantinople, and then after experiencing God's\r\nwonderful dealings with him (so graphically described by Miss Stern in\r\nher book \"Eliezer\") he made a public confession of his faith in Christ.\r\nHe was afterwards a student of the L.J.S. Training College at Palestine\r\nPlace, and was sent out as a missionary to Jassy, Roumania, by the same\r\nSociety. Later he laboured for some years in Edinburgh, under a Scotch\r\nSociety. He was the author of a work entitled, \"The Modern Hebrew and\r\nthe Hebrew Christian,\" London, 1882, which contains an autobiography,\r\nrelating his experience after deserting from the Russian army, and\r\ninformation about the Hasidim, especially the sect \"Habad.\" Also \"A\r\nFinger-post to the Way of Salvation,\" 1882. In 1881 he published a\r\npamphlet entitled \"Eintracht\" (Harmony), in which he pleaded the cause of\r\nthe Jews against the Anti-Semitic agitation in Germany.\r\n\r\nBECHAR, J., baptized at Constantinople in 1873, studied at St.\r\nChrischona, Basel, and was appointed later as City Missionary in\r\nNeuchâtel.\r\n\r\nBEHRENS, A. J., convert, student and missionary of L.J.S, was pioneer\r\nMissionary in Safed in the forties of the 18th century and at Jassy in\r\n1850.\r\n\r\nBEHRENS, Rev. A. D., son of the former, esteemed of the L.J.S., whom the\r\nwriter learned to know and love in 1873 at Breslau, was appointed to the\r\ncharge of the Mission at Vienna in 1875. A daughter married the convert\r\nGlück, a physician of high standing in Bucharest. Thus father and child\r\nhave made known God's truth in their respective spheres.\r\n\r\nBEHRENS, S. J., another Jewish convert, was for twenty years accountant\r\nand collector of the Operative Jewish Converts' Institution, an\r\nexemplary Christian, and well beloved by all who came in contact with\r\nhim. His life made a salutary impression upon his rich brothers in\r\nHamburg, who, although they yet remained members of the synagogue,\r\ngranted his wife a liberal pension for life.\r\n\r\nBELLSON, Rev. R., born in the neighbourhood of Cassel, Germany, in 1805.\r\nL.J.S. missionary from 1831, successor of Pauli in Berlin, 1844. He was\r\nan excellent scholar and was much respected by the cultured Jews. In the\r\nvery first year of his activity there, he had the privilege of leading\r\ntwenty Jewish souls to the Saviour. One of his converts was the Rev. A.\r\nD. Hefter, another Kappelin. He wrote in \"Dibre Emeth,\" \"Blätter für\r\nIsrael's Gegenwart und Zukunft.\"\r\n\r\nBELMONTE, E., banker in New York, connected with Rothschild, joined the\r\nProtestant Church, whilst a number of the same family joined the Roman\r\nChurch at different times. (See \"Jewish Encyclopædia.\")\r\n\r\nBELMONTE, Hannah, a near relation of Da Costa, and later his wife,\r\nbecame a Christian in 1822.\r\n\r\nBENARY, Franz Ferdinand, born at Cassel in 1805, baptized between\r\n1824-27. He became Professor of Theology in 1831, lectured in Berlin on\r\nOriental languages and exegesis, published the Old Indian Art poem,\r\n\"Naloduza\" in 1830, a treatise under the title, \"De Leviratu,\" Hebr.\r\n1835.\r\n\r\nBENARY, Karl Albert Agathan, a brother of the former, likewise became a\r\nconvert, was teacher at the Gymnasium in Berlin, wrote largely on\r\nClassics, died in 1860.\r\n\r\nBENASON, A., after his conversion wrote several Christian hymns. (See\r\n\"Saat auf Hoffnung, 1881.\")\r\n\r\nBENDER, Carl Theodor, born at Berlin in 1818, studied law, and was\r\nbaptized in 1837 by Pastor Jonas of the Nikolai Kirche there.\r\n\r\nBENDERMAN, Edward, born in Berlin in 1811, son of a banker, embraced\r\nChristianity about 1832. He became a celebrated artist and professor of\r\nart in the Dresden Academy. Some of his pictures are: Boaz and Ruth, The\r\nJews in Babylon (Ps. cxxxvii.), Jeremiah amidst the ruins of Jerusalem,\r\nThe wandering of the Jews into captivity to Babylon, in the Natural\r\nGallery in Berlin. These pictures exhibit profound religious feeling on\r\nthe part of the artist, and sympathy with his Jewish brethren.\r\n\r\nBENDIX, Paul, Dr., was born at Rummelsberg in Prussia, Aug. 29, 1823. He\r\nwas early sent to a Christian school, where he was often moved to tears\r\nwhen hearing of the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ. At the age of\r\nseventeen he went to Danzig for rabbinical study, and afterwards to the\r\nBerlin University, where he gained the diploma of Ph.D. in 1850.\r\nSubsequently he became rabbi, and worked at Berent and Grandenz. He\r\ndisapproved of many of the old Jewish customs, but his congregation\r\nrefused to allow the introduction of any reforms. The wardens of the\r\nsynagogue at Grandenz, where he officiated from 1854 to 1858, wrote of\r\nhim in a testimonial: \"The sermons of Dr. Bendix were instructive and\r\nedifying, and owing to his splendid delivery and great oratorical power\r\nthey never failed to make a deep impression on his hearers.\" While at\r\nGrandenz he made the acquaintance of a Christian clergyman, through whom\r\nhe was led to study the New Testament. The reading of this deeply\r\naffected him. Later on he went to live in the house of a converted Jew,\r\nwhich caused many of his hearers to warn him not to hold intercourse\r\nwith him on Christianity. But he was now seeking for truth and peace,\r\nand though he avoided conversation, he could not help noticing the\r\nupright and serious life of his landlord, who closed his place of\r\nbusiness on the Lord's Day, held family worship morning and evening, and\r\ntook a keen interest in home and foreign missions. All this made an\r\nimpression on him, and made him say: \"This man, surely, possesses the\r\npeace I am seeking. He asked me one day what took the place of\r\nsacrifices since the Temple was destroyed, what were the essential\r\ncontents of the Jewish Prayer Book. I could only say to myself, Where is\r\nthe atonement for sin? I began to read the Old Testament with a\r\nterrified conscience, and soon I found that my religious system was\r\nbuilt on the sand.\" At last he felt that he must give up his position as\r\nrabbi, and he retired, not without much opposition, to Berlin, where he\r\nspent his whole time in the closest study of the Word of God. He became\r\nconvinced at last that the old covenant was merely a preparation for the\r\nnew one (Jer. xxxi. 31-34). One difficulty was the word \"virgin\" in Isa.\r\nvii. 14, but when he saw that it was always used in opposition to\r\nmarried women, he at once accepted Christ as his Saviour, and was\r\nbaptized with his wife and children in 1860, in St. Matthew's Church,\r\nBerlin. With a recommendation from Queen Elizabeth of Prussia he came\r\nover to England, and from 1883 worked in connexion with the L.J.S. in\r\nLondon. He died March 5, 1901, deeply regretted by both Jews and\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\nBENFEY, Theodor, born at Nöster, near Göthingen, January 28, 1809,\r\nbecame a convert to Christianity in 1848, died in 1881, at Göthingen. He\r\nwas author of numerous linguistic works on the Sanscrit, Bengali,\r\nHindustani, Persian, Egyptian, and Semitic languages. His two works in\r\nEnglish must be mentioned here: \"A Practical Grammar of the Sanscrit\r\nLanguage\" (Berlin 1863, London 1868), and \"A Sanscrit-English\r\nDictionary\" (London 1868). He established a periodical, \"Orient and\r\nOccident,\" in 1862.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN, Selig, a native of Bunzlau, Bohemia, and surgeon by profession\r\nabout the middle of last century. Embraced Roman Catholicism, but found\r\nno peace, so he relapsed into Judaism, but remained in the same\r\ncondition, wandering about to find satisfaction for his restless soul,\r\nuntil he came to Weikersheim in Würtemberg, and attended the services of\r\nthe court preacher Kern, when he was converted. Whereupon he went to the\r\nsynagogue and publicly confessed his evangelical faith before the\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN, a Dutch Jewish convert. The story of his conversion is a\r\nremarkable one and deserves a place here. Pauli and his assistant Bloch\r\nvisited once a Kabbalistic Jew on a very stormy night. The Jewish\r\nneighbours, when hearing of their visit, watched for them outside the\r\nhouse. They followed them on their way home, and when passing a bridge,\r\nsome called out, \"Make an end of him (Pauli); throw him into the\r\nwater.\" Whereupon Benjamin, who accompanied his visitors, cried, \"Away\r\nwith you!\" and pushed the assailants aside. \"He is a good man. He helped\r\nme to keep the Sabbath properly.\" They then went away abashed. Benjamin\r\nwas afterwards baptized with his whole family in the presence of 3,000\r\nJews. This was the first entire family which Pauli baptized at\r\nAmsterdam.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN, a Jewish convert in India, baptized by the Rev. ---- Laseron\r\nin 1849.\r\n\r\nBENNI, a Jew who first heard the Gospel from Wendt and Hoff in\r\nKönigsberg, became a Christian Pastor in Petrekow, later in Radorn, and\r\nthrough his faithful testimony not a few Jews decided to acknowledge\r\nJesus as their personal Saviour.\r\n\r\nBENOLY, Gabriel, M.D., baptized at Salem, Bromberg, in 1869, was\r\nafterwards for many years medical missionary of the L.J.S., and did good\r\nwork in the East End of London.\r\n\r\nBEN OLIEL, a well-known family in Oran, North Africa, has given to the\r\nChurch three sons about the middle of the eighteenth century, baptized\r\nby the Wesleyans in Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nBEN OLIEL, Rev. A., was for many years missionary in Rome, and then at\r\nJaffa and Jerusalem. He was a true man of God, an ardent lover of his\r\nnation, whose spiritual welfare he endeavoured to promote by word and\r\npen all through a long life. He died in America towards the close of\r\nlast century.\r\n\r\nBEN OLIEL, Rev. Maxwell Mochluff, after finishing his theological\r\ncourse at St. Aidan's, was ordained in 1860, and was curate in several\r\nchurches; also domestic chaplain to the Dowager Duchess of\r\nNorthumberland, 1864-66; minister of St. Patrick and St. Saviour, South\r\nKensington, 1878-81; missionary at W. Berkeley, California, 1889-91;\r\nRector of San Bernadino, Cal., 1891-93. Returning to England, he\r\nconducted a mission to the Jews at Kilburn, by writing and lectures. As\r\na good preacher and thoroughly conversant with Jewish and Christian\r\nliterature, he was gladly heard in the churches and cathedrals of\r\nEngland. His writings on the Jewish subject are numerous.\r\n\r\nBEN OLIEL, Moses, served for many years as Bible agent of the B. &\r\nF.B.S. at Oran.\r\n\r\nBEN ZION, Benedix (Baruch), born in Homoslaipolia in the government of\r\nKiev, Russia, in 1839, was led to become a Christian in a remarkable\r\nmanner. Once, when still a little boy in the Heder, he and his\r\nfellow-pupils passed by a Russian Church when they observed the cross\r\nand images. His companions at once repeated Deut. vii. 26, and spat on\r\nthe ground. Ben Zion did not like this behaviour, so he made figures and\r\na cross with his stick on the ground. This was reported to the teacher,\r\nwho locked him up and punished him severely for it. The fanaticism of\r\nthe Jews in the place was so great that Ben Zion's father lost his\r\nposition as Talmud teacher, because his boy had been reading\r\nMendelssohn's German translation of the Bible. At the age of 13 Ben Zion\r\nbegan his wandering career, and passing a chapel in a forest, his eyes\r\nmet the image of the Madonna and Child. Without the least desire to\r\nrender homage to the figure, but only conscious that for its sake he had\r\nalready suffered, he took off his hat, knelt down, and in this posture\r\nfell asleep, and was finally awakened by a peasant. These apparently\r\ntrifling circumstances caused him later on to think seriously of\r\nChristianity, and to search the Scriptures. He was baptized in Berlin in\r\n1863, then studied medicine and graduated at the University of Würzburg\r\nin 1867. He went to England, and having entered the service of the\r\nBritish Society for the Propagation of the Gospel among the Jews, was\r\nsent to Roumania in 1874 as medical missionary. In 1876 he was\r\ntransferred to Odessa, where he laboured successfully for ten years.\r\nThen he was for a short time in Constantinople, and since about 1888 he\r\nhas been living in the United States and helping in missionary work. He\r\nis the author of \"Orah Zedakah,\" a collection of proverbs and parables\r\nin the style of Ecclesiasticus (Odessa, 1876); \"Kol Kore el Beth Israel\"\r\n(translated from the English by Dr. Ben Zion, London, 1868); a\r\ntranslation into Judæo-German of Jos. H. Ingraham's \"Prince of the House\r\nof David,\" under the title of \"Tiferet Yisrael\" (Odessa, 1883-88), and a\r\ntranslation into Judæo-German of Silvio Pelier's drama, \"Ester\r\nd'Engedé,\" under the title \"Der Falsche Cohengodel.\"\r\n\r\nBERDENBACH, born at Offenbach, in 1809, brother of the great lawyer of\r\nthat name in Darmstadt, was baptized by Pastor Schultz in Berlin, in\r\n1839.\r\n\r\nBERGER, Rev. S. D., convert and student of the L.J.S., was afterwards\r\nordained to the Ministry in the Lutheran Church U.S., and was appointed\r\nmissionary to the Jews in Chicago about 1885.\r\n\r\nBERGHEIM, M., a noble Jewish convert, was sent out by the L.J.S. in 1837\r\nto assist the Rev. Nicolayson in his work in Jerusalem. He was\r\nafterwards a banker and died in 1896 as churchwarden of Christ Church,\r\nMount Zion. The Jewish traveller, Dr. Ludwig August Frankel, who\r\npublished a book on his visit to Jerusalem in 1860 (translated into\r\nHebrew by M. E. Stern), says he found there 131 Jewish Christians in the\r\nHoly City, nine of whom were of the Bergheim family.\r\n\r\nBERGMANN, Marcus S., convert of the L.J.S., is well-known as a\r\nmissionary of the L.C.M. and translator of the Bible into Yiddish. A\r\nsecond edition, with improved translation into simple Jargon, was issued\r\nby him in 1905. In an account of his conversion he thus writes:--\r\n\r\n\"I was born in Wieruszow, on the borders of Silesia, in the year 1846.\r\nMy father (who was of the sect of Chassidim, which is the strictest sect\r\nof the Pharisees, and a great Talmudist) died when I was about a year\r\nold. Of my dear mother I have only a very dim recollection, as she, too,\r\ndied when I was but six years old. I had one elder brother and one\r\nsister. My brother was established in a large way of business in Luben,\r\na town near Breslau, and my sister was brought up in the house of the\r\nChief Rabbi of Breslau, Rabbi G'dalia Titkin (who was a relative of\r\nours), whilst I was brought up with my uncle, Woolf Bergmann, a Chassid\r\nlike my father, in Wieruszow, under whom I studied much of the Talmudic\r\nand Rabbinical literature.\r\n\r\n\"When I was fourteen years of age I was sent to Breslau to study under\r\nthe chief Rabbi there. I did not like it at first, as I had to change my\r\nChassidic dress for the German style, but I soon became accustomed to\r\nit. After a residence of three years in Breslau I went to one of my\r\nuncles who was a Rabbi in Frankenstein, under whom I had ample\r\nopportunity to practise for some time. I then went back to live with my\r\nsister in Kalisch, and applied myself more than ever to the study of the\r\nTalmud, believing it to be the most honourable of all employment and\r\nmost conducive to the glory of God, and the best mode of making amends\r\nfor my sins, which I found clung to me even when engaged in these\r\nreligious duties.\r\n\r\n\"The word of the LORD to Abraham (Gen. xii. 1), 'Get thee out of thy\r\ncountry and from thy kindred ... unto a land that I will shew thee,'\r\nseemed at that time to be constantly ringing in my ears, and made me so\r\nrestless that I could not put my mind to anything. I obeyed that voice,\r\nand in 1866, I left my native country and came to England. Shortly after\r\nmy arrival in London I established a small synagogue at which I\r\ngratuitously officiated as minister for nearly two years; my sister from\r\ntime to time sending me remittances, as I required, from the portion\r\nwhich I inherited of my father's property.\r\n\r\n\"It pleased the Lord at this time to lay His hand upon me, and I was\r\nlaid aside for six weeks in the German hospital. When feeling a little\r\nbetter I began to look into the Hebrew Bible, which was on the shelf in\r\nthe ward. As a reader in the synagogue I knew the letter of the whole of\r\nthe Pentateuch and other portions of the Old Testament by heart.\r\n\r\n\"The portion of Scripture that made a great impression on me at the time\r\nof my illness was Daniel ix. Several verses of this chapter (the\r\nconfession of Daniel) are repeated each Monday and Thursday by every\r\nJew; but the latter part of the chapter, which so plainly prophesies the\r\nsuffering of the Messiah, is never read--in fact the Rabbis pronounce a\r\ndreadful curse upon any one who investigates the prophecy of these\r\nseventy weeks. They say: 'Their bones shall rot who compute the end of\r\nthe time.' Remembering this anathema, it was with fear and trembling\r\nthat I read the passage about the seventy weeks, and coming to verse 26,\r\n'Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself'--though we Jews are most\r\ncareful not to let a Hebrew book drop to the ground--I threw that Hebrew\r\nBible out of my hand, thinking in my ignorance that it was one of the\r\nmissionaries' Bibles. But although I threw the Bible away, I could not\r\nthrow away the words I had just read: 'Messiah shall be cut off, but not\r\nfor Himself.' These words sank deeper and deeper into my soul, and\r\nwherever I looked I seemed to see them in flaming Hebrew characters, and\r\nI had no rest for some time. One morning I again took up the Bible, and\r\nwithout thinking or looking for any particular passage, my eyes were\r\narrested by these words (also in a chapter which is never read by the\r\nJews): 'For He was cut off out of the land of the living; for the\r\ntransgression of My people was He stricken.' (Isa. liii. 8.)\r\n\r\n\"This seemed to be the answer to the question I was constantly asking\r\nmyself during this time of soul-conflict--'Messiah shall be cut off, but\r\nnot for Himself.' For whom then? Here it was plainly revealed to me.\r\n'For the transgression of My people;' and surely I belonged to His\r\npeople, therefore Messiah was cut off for me.\r\n\r\n\"Shortly after this I left the hospital and was again among my Jewish\r\nfriends, but I could not banish from my mind these two passages.\r\n\r\n\"One morning I put on my phylacteries and tallith in order to perform\r\nthe prescribed prayers, but I could not utter a single sentence out of\r\nthe prayer book before me. One passage (Psalm cxix. 18), 'Open Thou mine\r\neyes that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law,' came into my\r\nmind, and that I repeated over and over again, and for nearly two hours\r\nthat was the cry of my soul. After laying aside the phylacteries and\r\ntallith I left the house without tasting food, and as I walked along the\r\nstreets I prayed again in the words of the Psalmist, 'Lead me in Thy\r\ntruth and teach me, for Thou art the God of my salvation, on Thee do I\r\nwait all the day long.' My heart was burdened with a very great load,\r\nand yet I dared not open my mind to any one. In this state I believe the\r\nSpirit of God led me to Palestine Place. My heart failed me when I\r\nreached the door of the late Rev. Dr. Ewald's house.\r\n\r\n\"After several vain attempts, I ventured to knock, and was admitted to\r\nsee that venerable servant of the Lord. To him I unburdened my soul and\r\ntold him all that was in my heart. He asked me whether I was willing to\r\ncome into his Home for enquirers in order to be instructed in the truth\r\nas it is in the Lord Jesus. I told him that was just what I needed, and\r\nat once accepted his kindness, and I did not return to my Jewish\r\nfriends. This was just one week before the Passover.\r\n\r\n\"On the first day of the feast several Jews of my congregation, who had\r\ndiscovered where I was, came and entreated me to leave the missionaries\r\nand go back with them. As I refused to do so, they said they would soon\r\nget me away with disgrace. They left, but only for a short time, and\r\nwhen they returned they brought a policeman with them and charged me\r\nwith being a thief, and as such I was taken to the nearest police\r\nstation and locked up. Whilst in the cell I was visited by several Jews\r\nwho implored me to return to them, and said that if I promised to do so\r\nthey would not appear against me on the morrow, and I would be\r\nliberated. I answered in the words of David, when Gad, the seer, was\r\nsent to give him the choice of his own punishment: 'Let me fall into the\r\nhands of the Lord, for His mercies are great, but into the hands of man\r\nlet me not fall;' and I added, 'Thou shalt not bear false witness\r\nagainst thy neighbour.' They left me disappointed. But I never spent a\r\nhappier night than in that prison cell, for I felt and fully realized\r\nthat the Lord was with me, and it was there that I for the first time\r\nknelt down and prayed to God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.\r\nThough up to this time I knew very little or nothing of the New\r\nTestament, yet it seemed to me as if the Lord Jesus spoke to me in the\r\nsame manner as He did to His disciples. 'They shall put you out of the\r\nsynagogues, yea, the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think\r\nthat he doeth God service; these things will they do unto you because\r\nthey have not known the Father nor Me. But these things I have told you,\r\nthat when the time shall come, ye may remember that I have told you of\r\nthem.' 'And when they bring you unto magistrates, and powers take ye no\r\nthought how or what thing ye shall answer, for the Holy Ghost shall\r\nteach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.' Passage after passage\r\nseemed to come before me, as if the Lord Jesus had spoken audibly to me\r\nto encourage me to cling close to Him and not to fear what man could do\r\nunto me.\r\n\r\n\"The night--though sleepless--I passed joyfully and peacefully. The\r\nmorning came, which brought other Jewish visitors with food from their\r\ntable, also entreating me to return to my Jewish friends. As I refused,\r\nthey told me that they had witnesses to prove the charge against me, and\r\nI should be put into prison for at least three months; but I felt that\r\nthe Lord Jesus was my advocate, and that He would plead my cause.\r\n\r\n\"About 10 o'clock I was taken out of the police cell and led to the\r\nMansion House (followed by a large number of Jews) to appear before the\r\nLord Mayor of London. The whole judgment hall was filled with Jews. My\r\nchief accuser swore that I had robbed him, and three others gave their\r\nevidence on oath against me. The Lord Mayor asked me, through an\r\ninterpreter (for I could not then speak English), what I had to say in\r\nmy defence, and whether I had any witnesses to prove my innocence. I\r\nreplied, 'I stand here in this position on account of my faith in the\r\nLord Jesus Christ. I am not only not guilty of the crime which is\r\nimputed to me, but I have left all my valuable things at the house where\r\nI lodged. It is only because I wish to become a Christian that I am\r\naccused.' The Lord Mayor then ordered my chief accuser again into the\r\nwitness box, and asked him whether he knew that it was my intention to\r\nbecome a Christian. The expression which flashed across his angry\r\ncountenance and was reflected by the face of the other Jews present,\r\nsufficiently answered the question before he could speak a word.\r\n\r\n\"On cross-examination they so contradicted each other that they\r\nthemselves proved my innocence, and I was at once set at liberty. (I\r\nwish it to be clearly understood that this persecution was not in enmity\r\nto myself personally, but rather in friendship and mistaken zeal. They\r\nwished to save me at any cost from becoming a Christian).\r\n\r\n\"On leaving the Mansion House I returned to Dr. Ewald, and after being\r\nthoroughly instructed in the Scriptures, I was admitted into the visible\r\nChurch of Christ on the 7th of June, 1868, by the rite of baptism.\r\n\r\n\"After my baptism I was admitted into the Operative Jewish Converts'\r\nInstitution, where I stayed nearly two years. In May, 1870, I was\r\naccepted as an agent of the London City Mission, to work among my poor\r\nbenighted people in the East of London. During the first few years of my\r\nmission work I had naturally to undergo much persecution, and the work\r\nwas most arduous, but by the blessing of God this is in a great measure\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\n\"It is now fully thirty-one years since I became a follower of the Lord\r\nJesus Christ, and I can look back upon all these years and say that not\r\none good thing hath failed of all His gracious promises.\"\r\n\r\nBERNAL, Jacob Israel, an English Jew, in the first half of the 19th\r\ncentury, had his children baptized, only one son, Ralph, remained in\r\nJudaism.\r\n\r\nBERNAL, Osborn, M.P., the son of Ralph, embraced Christianity, and his\r\ndaughter married the Duke of St. Albans.\r\n\r\nBERNARD, D., baptized in Wilna with his wife and daughter in 1818, by\r\nPastor Nichlous, of the Lutheran Church, is recorded as having lived an\r\nexemplary Christian life. He was first baptized in the Roman Church,\r\ncame then in contact with Luther, who had won him for the Evangelical\r\nTruth, and wrote to him a letter with a view to strengthen him in the\r\nfaith, and that he should make it known to his brethren.\r\n\r\nBERNARD, Herman, born in Southern Russia in 1785, baptized in his youth,\r\nsettled in Cambridge as a private teacher in 1830, and was appointed\r\n\"Preceptor Linguæ Sacræ\" in the University, October 18, 1837. Bernard\r\npublished the following works--\"The Creed and Ethics of the Jews\" in\r\nselections from the \"Yad Hahazakah\" of Maimonides (1832), and\r\n\"Hamenahel\" (the Guide of the Hebrew Student), 1839. The \"Me Menichoth\"\r\n(Still Waters), an easy, practical Hebrew grammar, in two volumes,\r\nappeared during his blindness. His lectures on the book of Job appeared\r\nin one volume in 1864.\r\n\r\nBERNARD, Rudolf, a Swiss Jewish convert, published an Epistle to the\r\nJews in 1705, under the title \"Lekah Tob\" (good doctrine), in which he\r\ntried to influence them in favour of Christianity.\r\n\r\nBERNAYS, Michael, was baptized in the 19th century, date not known. In\r\n1872 and 1873 he taught at the University of Leipzig, and in 1874 he was\r\nappointed extraordinary Professor of Modern German, English and French\r\nLiterature, at the University of Munich. He wrote on the poetry of\r\nGoethe, under the title, \"Der junge Goethe,\" Leipzig, 1875.\r\n\r\nBERNHARD, a Polish Rabbi, who was baptized by Pastor Storr, in the 18th\r\ncentury, in Heilbronn, assumed the name of Christoph. David Bernhard. He\r\nwas afterwards Reader of Hebrew at Jena, and later at Tübingen.

We have only his memorial preserved as having been an\r\nassociate of Rev. J. Neander, and of another proselyte, Bonhome, in the\r\nevangelization of the Jews in New York, about 1845.\r\n\r\nBERNSTEIN, Rev. Aaron, born in Skalat, Galicia, in 1841, received, as an\r\nonly son, a good and pious early education, and was when quite young\r\nbrought under the influence of the wonder Rabbi of the town, with whose\r\ngrandson he learned Talmud at school. At the age of 17 he was assistant\r\nteacher in a town in Moldavia, when the Rev. W. Mayer, L.J.S. missionary\r\nat Jassy, appeared one day in the Synagogue and had a discussion with\r\nthe Jews, on which occasion he received a German tract, entitled \"The\r\nRighteous shall live by his Faith.\" This made some impression upon him,\r\nbut it passed away, as he was too young to understand it all. A few\r\nyears later he went to Jassy, when he met Mr. Mayer again, who gave him\r\na Hebrew New Testament and the \"Old Paths.\" These were the means under\r\nGod of leading him eventually to acknowledge the Saviour. He was\r\nbaptized by Dr. Ewald, together with nine other Jews, on November 22,\r\n1863. After being for a short time in the Operative Jewish Converts'\r\nInstitution, he went to the United States, and after a year or so of\r\nteaching in a school and privately, he entered a missionary college\r\nwhich was established by a German missionary, known later as Bishop Auer\r\nof Cape Palmas. He then studied Theology in the General Seminary, New\r\nYork, was ordained Deacon in Philadelphia in July 1870, and appointed by\r\nBishop Stevens as Rector of St. Paul's, Manheim, Pa. In June, 1871, the\r\nL.J.S. sent him as missionary to Jerusalem, where he laboured only\r\nabout a year and a-half, as he could not stand the climate. Subsequently\r\nhe laboured in Bucharest, Paris, Liverpool, and Frankfort, but the\r\ngreater part of his missionary career was in London, with the exception\r\nof an interval of three years, in which he was curate in Hertfordshire.\r\nBernstein had the honorary degree of M.A. conferred upon him by Columbia\r\nCollege, New York, in 1873, owing to his taking the Greek Prize at the\r\nSeminary in 1870, and later the Faculty of the Seminary gave him B.D. He\r\nwrote \"Sefer Roshey Hatayvoth,\" \"Anglo-Israel Theory,\" translated\r\nProfessor Cassel's \"Commentary on the Book of Esther\" into English,\r\ntogether with the \"Targum Sheni\" from the Original and Appendices (T. &\r\nT. Clark, Edinburgh, 1888). He published \"The City of David,\" \"The Book\r\nand the People,\" and contributed articles to the \"Hebrew Christian\r\nWitness,\" \"The Scattered Nation,\" \"The Everlasting Nation,\" \"Jews and\r\nChristians,\" \"The Jewish Missionary Intelligence,\" and wrote about a\r\ndozen tracts in English, Hebrew and Yiddish, and revised a new edition\r\nof the Hebrew Bible in 1895.

Though brief, the information of this convert is\r\nvery interesting. He was baptized by the Rev. H. Stewart, in Liverpool,\r\non the same day that his spiritual teacher, the missionary H. J.\r\nJoseph, was ordained to the ministry of the Church of England, in 1836.\r\n\r\nBIESENTHAL, Dr. Joiachim Heinrich--or, to give him his birth-name,\r\nRaphael Hirsch--was born at Lobsens, in the Grand Duchy of Posen, on\r\nDecember 24th, 1804, of pious and strict Jewish parents. His early\r\neducation was chiefly confined to the study of the national law and\r\ntradition; and through much self-denial and sacrifice on the part of his\r\nparents, who intended him for the rabbinate, he was able to have lessons\r\nfrom the best teachers and most learned Talmudist scholars of the day.\r\nHe was what is called a _Bachur_ (_lit_. \"young man\"), a student of the\r\nBeth Hamidrash, who is intended for the study of the law. The Talmudical\r\nprinciple, \"Know well what to answer an infidel,\" particularly moved his\r\nfather to insist that he should join with the study of Talmud that of\r\nthe Holy Scriptures and Jewish poetry. He soon found, however, that as\r\nregards his study of the Bible he was left to his own diligence and\r\nperseverance, for his teachers knew nothing at all about it; and, being\r\nimbued with the Talmudical warning--\"Keep your children from the study\r\nof Holy Scripture,\" they were of opinion that it was not only a useless\r\nstudy and waste of time, but also a danger to one's piety.\r\n\r\nIn 1819, when Raphael was fifteen years of age, the town of Lobsens was\r\ndestroyed by fire, by which his parents were ruined. His education,\r\nhowever, had to be completed, and so he entered the famous Jewish school\r\nof Rawitsch, where he received instruction from rabbis, and principally\r\nfrom Rabbi Herzfeld, of European renown. Deprived of every assistance\r\nfrom home, young Raphael had to struggle hard during his four year's\r\nresidence there. On leaving Rawitsch he went to Mainz, where he received\r\nmost kind care and support from the Rabbi of that city, Löb Ellinger,\r\nbrother of the renowned Nathan Ellinger, or Nathan Bar Yospa, rabbi of\r\nBingen, several of whose manuscripts are in the Bodleian.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Heidenheim (Wolf Ben Samson) of Rödelheim, the greatest\r\nJewish critic and grammarian after Ibn-Ezra and David Kimchi, helped him\r\nto the treasures of Jewish literature, lending him the best grammars in\r\nthe Hebrew language, so that he was able to acquire, with great\r\napplication on his part, a complete mastery of grammatical Hebrew. He\r\nnext gave himself up to the study of German history, and Latin and\r\nGreek. His studies threw him into contact with the Rev. Dr. Klee, Roman\r\nCatholic Professor at Bonn, who gave him lessons in Hebrew, and\r\nintroduced him to the Duchess of Coburg, the wife of General de\r\nMensdorff, Governor of the fortress of Mainz. From her, and all the\r\nfamily, Raphael received many substantial proofs of kindness, and when\r\nhe was about to leave Mainz, which he did in 1828, she gave him a\r\nconsiderable sum of money, and a letter written by herself to Baron de\r\nRothschild, of Frankfort-on-the-Main, and graciously intimated that she\r\nwould be glad to hear how he was getting on in life. Raphael found the\r\nBaron not inclined to assist him when he heard that he meant to finish\r\nhis studies at Berlin, because he considered that a dangerous city,\r\nwhere _all young Jewish students were being converted to Christianity_.\r\nThat there was great truth in this statement will appear lower down.\r\n\"Keep away from a city where thousands become apostates!\" were his\r\nparting words. Baron de Rothschild, however, sent him a letter of\r\nrecommendation to Baron de Hägemann, the Chancellor. When Raphael\r\ndelivered the letter, the not unnatural remark was, \"What is the use of\r\na recommendation for assistance from Rothschild! Why did he not help you\r\nhimself?\" So he was obliged to shift for himself at Berlin, and to earn\r\nhis living by giving lessons. He employed his leisure time in study. In\r\nthe year 1830 he resided for four weeks with a Christian family at\r\nHavelberg, where he learnt for the first time what true Christianity\r\nwas, and he determined, as he said, to \"search for Christian truth.\" In\r\nthis purpose his intercourse with Christian divines greatly helped him.\r\nHe studied theology and philology in the University of Berlin from 1828,\r\ntaking his doctor's degree in 1835. He studied under the Oriental\r\nscholar, William Vatke, and his knowledge of the Hebrew grammar was\r\ngreatly increased by personal friendly intercourse with Dr. Gesenius,\r\nthe distinguished Hebrew scholar, at Halle. Raphael was baptized in 1836\r\nby the Rev. Dr. Kuntze, taking the Christian names of Joiachim Heinrich\r\nand the surname of Biesenthal.\r\n\r\nThat there was a considerable truth in Baron de Rothschild's observation\r\ngiven above, is seen from the statistics of Jewish baptisms in those\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nDr. Kuntze, who was a resident clergyman at Berlin, was instrumental in\r\nleading many young Jews to Christ. He baptized eighty in eight years\r\n(1829-36), whilst the Society's missionary, the Rev. W. Ayerst, baptized\r\nforty-two adult Jews in three years (1834-7). Altogether, 326 Jewish\r\nbaptisms were registered in the Consistory at Berlin during the years\r\n1830-37. A few years later (1844) the Rev. C. W. H. Pauli, the Society's\r\nmissionary, reported that there were above 1,000 converts resident in\r\nBerlin; and in 1850, as many as 2,500. They filled all ranks and\r\nstations, and were to be found in all the ministerial departments, and\r\nin the university.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, Biesenthal placed his services at the disposal of the Society,\r\nand in doing so, wrote: \"My Biblical studies led me, after much\r\nsearching and wandering for a long time, to find Him of whom Moses and\r\nthe Prophets did write. This result, this light which God caused to\r\nshine in my darkness, I deem it my unrelenting duty to communicate to\r\nothers yet living in darkness, because the Lord Himself says that we\r\nshould not put our light under a bushel. The Apostles, as well as all\r\nthe Fathers, were furthered by the same disposition of mind. 'For where\r\nyour treasure is, there will your heart be also,' says the Lord. If\r\nChrist be our treasure, our heart must be entirely and undividedly His\r\nown, and all our talents devoted to the glory of His kingdom. Becoming a\r\nmissionary seems to me the surest way to fulfil Christ's commands. I\r\nhave long considered it both a duty and a privilege to communicate to my\r\nbrethren after the flesh the message of salvation, and to employ those\r\ntalents which God has given me for their welfare. My predilection for\r\nthe above has often seemed to be a token of God's will that I should\r\nshew my brethren from their very literature, as well as from the Bible,\r\nthat the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid in Christ, and that\r\nwe can only know the Father through Him. During the last three years I\r\nhave acted upon this conviction, and embraced every opportunity to prove\r\nto my brethren that the Gospel of Christ is the power of God unto\r\nsalvation, and my anxious desire now is to be enabled to devote all my\r\ntime to this pursuit.\"\r\n\r\nThese earnest words are an echo of St. Paul's, \"My heart's desire and\r\nprayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved\" (Rom. x. 1). With\r\nthis spirit and aim, Biesenthal entered upon his long missionary career\r\nof 37 years in connexion with this Society--active laborious years spent\r\nin Berlin (1844-1868) and Leipzig (1868-1881). Eloquent in the\r\nScriptures, with a perfect command of Hebrew and wide knowledge of\r\nTalmud and rabbinical literature, he was thoroughly furnished for his\r\nlife's work. Those who knew him well believed that he had intellectual,\r\nliterary and biblical qualifications in a most eminent degree, and that\r\nhe was the best Hebrew scholar of their acquaintance. His knowledge of\r\nlanguages embraced--in addition to his native Polish--Hebrew, Latin,\r\nGreek, Syriac, Chaldee, Arabic, Ethiopic, Samaritan, French, German,\r\nSpanish, Italian and English. Never was missionary more highly gifted\r\nwith \"tongues\"--his equal in this respect is not to be found in the\r\nranks of the London Jews' Society; whilst with his pen he did even\r\nbetter service than with his lips in proclaiming \"Jesus Christ and Him\r\ncrucified\" to his brethren after the flesh.\r\n\r\nBiesenthal's missionary life commenced on April 1st, 1844, as an\r\nassistant missionary in this Society's mission at Berlin, under the Rev.\r\nC. W. H. Pauli, where he also undertook the editorship of \"Records of\r\nIsrael's State and Prospects,\" a monthly periodical designed to promote\r\nthe Society's work, to give treatises on Messianic passages of the Old\r\nTestament, to discuss Christian and Jewish doctrines, and to give\r\nattention to Jewish history and literature; he also wrote many articles\r\nfor the \"Dibre Emeth.\" He continued to work in this humble capacity\r\nunder the Rev. R. Bellson until 1868, when his great abilities found a\r\nrecognition, even though tardy, by his appointment to the charge of a\r\nnew mission station of the Society at Leipzig. This important city, the\r\nsecond in Saxony, and the seat of a university, had for many years been\r\nvisited by the Society's missionaries from Berlin at the time of the\r\ngreat fairs, when Jews assembled from all parts, and to whom large\r\nnumbers of Old and New Testaments were sold. Biesenthal found some\r\nseventy or eighty Hebrew Christians living there, and subsequently gave\r\nit as his opinion that they might be \"numbered by hundreds.\" There was a\r\nsmall Jewish community of about 500, who, since 1849, had enjoyed the\r\nrights of citizenship. This may seem to have been but a small field of\r\nwork for a man of such attainments, but he was the only missionary to\r\nthe Jews throughout the whole kingdom of Saxony; and, moreover, Leipzig\r\nwas the resort of many foreign Jews from Poland, Russia, Turkey, Greece,\r\nPersia, and even from America, and thus altogether an important\r\nmissionary centre. Apart from the visible results in the form of\r\nbaptisms from Biesenthal's labours, the indirect results were great and\r\nfar-reaching. As a scholar his name was, for many years, a household\r\nword in Germany, and especially in those circles where the Jewish\r\nmission exerted its influence. His Commentaries on the Gospels and the\r\nEpistles to the Romans and the Hebrews, so eminently useful in mission\r\nwork, obtained well-deserved eminence.\r\n\r\nThe mission field, as time went on, became less promising and fruitful,\r\nthe Jews becoming infected with the socialism and rationalism in\r\nGermany, as taught in the universities, churches, schools, and other\r\ninstitutions. Zeal for missions almost died out; the Jews became the\r\nsubject of much Anti-Semitism. The long pent-up enmity against them\r\nburst forth with great virulence. In Leipzig, as in other places,\r\npetitions were sent to the Government urging the withdrawal of their\r\npolitical rights and privileges. In return, the Jews paid back hatred by\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\nThis state of things led Dr. Biesenthal to take a gloomy view of the\r\ngeneral position. In his last report but one he said: \"Hurricanes of\r\ntrouble are blowing from the four quarters of the earth against the\r\nChurch and against the Gospel,\" and added that in such circumstances\r\nhis report could not be a joyous one.\r\n\r\nDr. Biesenthal doubtless obtained more satisfaction from his literary\r\nthan from his missionary labours; although, in his case, one was the\r\ncomplement of the other. A scholar he was emphatically, and a brilliant\r\none withal, as his works abundantly and substantially testify; and as\r\nsuch he will be principally remembered.\r\n\r\nHis published works contained the following: \"Auszüge aus dem Buche\r\nSohar, mit Deutscher Uebersetzung\" (1837), a proof from Jewish sources\r\nof the doctrine of the Trinity and other Christian verities;\r\n\"Hebräisches und Chaldäisches Schulwörterbuch über das A.T.\" (1836-7);\r\n\"David Kimchi's [Hebrew: sefer hashorashim] or Liber Radicum\" (1838-48),\r\nin collaboration with F. S. Lebrecht; \"The Thirty-nine Articles of the\r\nChurch of England\" (1840); \"The Book of Psalms,\" Hebrew text and\r\nCommentary (1841); \"The Book of Isaiah,\" Hebrew Text and Commentary\r\n(1841); \"Chrestomathia Rabbinica Sive Libri Quatuor, etc.\" (1844);\r\n\"Menachem ben Serug's Hebrew Lexicon\" (1847); \"Theologisch-Historische\r\nStudien\" (1847); \"Zur Geschichte der Christlichen Kirche,\" etc. (1850);\r\n\"Das Trostschreiben des Apostels Paulus an die Hebraer\" (1878); and a\r\nHebrew Translation of the Epistles to the \"Hebrews and the Romans,\" with\r\nCommentary (1857-8). He also wrote Commentaries on \"St. Matthew's\r\nGospel, the Acts of the Apostles,\" an Essay on \"The Atonement\"; and the\r\n\"Life of Gerson.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1877, the University of Giessen conferred upon him the degree of\r\nDoctor of Divinity.\r\n\r\nIn his greatest work, the \"History of the Christian Church,\" intended\r\nfor the special use of the Jews, he proved that they stood in close\r\nconnexion with the early Church, by bringing prominently forward the\r\nhistory of Jewish believers who loved their Saviour devotedly and\r\nlaboured successfully for the spread of the Gospel at the time of its\r\nfirst promulgation.\r\n\r\nDr. Isaac Jost (1793-1860), the learned Jewish historian of Frankfort,\r\nin reviewing Dr. Biesenthal's \"Commentary on the Epistle to the\r\nHebrews,\" referred to it as a masterly composition, and also to the\r\nauthor's extraordinary command of the Hebrew language, and said it\r\nexcelled everything which had ever been written before in the endeavour\r\nto prove, not only that Christianity is to be found in the writings of\r\nalmost all the ancient prophets, and that Christ's coming fulfilled the\r\nlaw, but that the rabbis of almost every age agree with the writers of\r\nthe New Testament as to the general character of the Messiah promised,\r\nalthough they do not admit that Jesus was that Messiah.\r\n\r\nDr. Julius Fürst (1805-1873), another eminent Jewish author, referring\r\nto Biesenthal's Commentaries generally, and the extensive erudition and\r\nthorough knowledge displayed of Jewish literature before and after the\r\nChristian era, bore still higher testimony, and stated that all previous\r\nattempts to translate the New Testament, or parts of it, were exceeded\r\nby the distinguished labours of Dr. Biesenthal, not only on account of\r\nthe richness and fulness of matter, extracted with much taste from the\r\nTalmud, Midrash, and Sohar, but also on account of the clearness of\r\nthought with which he penetrated and exhibited the doctrinal teaching of\r\nthe Apostles.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter for deep regret that these valuable Commentaries are out\r\nof print, and consequently out of circulation.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting circumstance that Biesenthal also wrote, 1840,\r\nunder the pseudonym \"Karl Ignaz Corvé,\" a work entitled \"Ueber den\r\nUrsprung die Juden Erhobenen Beschuldigung bei der Feier Ihrer Ostern\r\nsich des Blutes zu bedienen, etc.,\" in which he defended the Jews from\r\nthe Blood Accusation at Damascus.\r\n\r\nDr. Biesenthal retired from active service in 1881, and died at Berlin\r\non June 25th, 1886, at the advanced age of 82 years.\r\n\r\nBINION, Dr. Samuel A., son of Joshua, born in Suwalki, Poland, where he\r\nreceived a good Hebrew and Talmudic education, and then studied at\r\nWilna, Breslau and Padua, under great Jewish savants. He then went to\r\nEngland, about 1864-5, where, like Philip, he found Jesus to be the\r\nMessiah, and he was baptized by the Rev. Dr. Ewald in Palestine Place.\r\nHe then attended lectures at King's College, and, probably through the\r\ninfluence of Dr. Schwarz, he was sent to labour in the Protestant cause\r\nin Spain, where he became superintendent of schools in Seville and in\r\nthe Balearic Islands. Thence he went to the United States, where his\r\nlinguistic attainments and great learning found free scope and due\r\nacknowledgment. There he largely contributed to current encyclopædias.\r\nHe was one of the revisers of the \"Century Dictionary of Names,\" and\r\nwrote the article on the Kabbalah in \"Charles Warner's Cyclopædia of the\r\nWorld's Best Literature.\" Dr. Binion's master work is \"Ancient Egypt,\"\r\ntwo elaborate folio volumes on the art and archæology of Egypt. He is\r\nalso the translator of \"'Quo Vadis,' with Fire and Sword,\" Dan Michael,\r\npublished in Holiday de Luxe editions, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nBLEIBTREU, Philip Johann, born at Frankfort-on-the-Main, in the middle\r\nof the seventeenth century, died in 1702. He published a work in German,\r\nentitled \"Meir Naor\" (the enlightened Meir from his Jewish name Meir),\r\nFrankfort, 1787, giving an account of his conversion, notes on the\r\nJewish festivals, and on some Jewish prayers. The last words he uttered\r\nwhen dying were, \"Ich bleibe treu\" (\"I remain faithful\"), in allusion to\r\nhis name, which is equivalent to the English name \"Faithful.\"\r\n\r\nBLOCH, Edward, born in 1810. While holding the office of first master in\r\na Jewish school, was convinced of the truth of the Gospel, and then\r\nbaptized by Pastor Kunze, in Breslau, in 1836.\r\n\r\nBLOCH, Julius Paul, was born April 16th, 1816 at Jutroschin, in Prussia.\r\nHis parents, Simon and Zipporah, brought him up to be, like themselves,\r\nstrictly orthodox. Being clever, before he was 13 years old, when he\r\nbecame \"Bar Mitzvah,\" he had gained a thorough Talmudical education. He\r\ngrew up a very strict pious Jew, never missing synagogue either morning\r\nor evening. In his fourteenth year he was apprenticed to a furrier.\r\nWhilst thus earning his living, two missionaries came to Jutroschin.\r\nTheir advent caused a great commotion, as the city was then renowned as\r\none of the strongholds of Judaism. The Jews determined to oppose their\r\nwork, and Julius Bloch was one of the foremost to stone them. A year or\r\ntwo later he had to travel as a journeyman in his trade. This eventually\r\nbrought him to Greifswalde, where he found employment with a Mr. Albert,\r\nwho, at last, made him foreman in his factory. This man and his wife\r\nwere true Christians, and often talked to him about Christ. He noticed,\r\ntoo, the peace they enjoyed in hours of the greatest adversity, and his\r\nfaith in Judaism, as a religion of comfort, was shaken. At last he tried\r\nto turn a deaf ear to all they said, but the seeds of eternal life had\r\nbeen sown in his heart. He began to feel lonely and unhappy; he could no\r\nlonger say the Hebrew prayers, Jewish ceremonies began to lose their\r\nhold, as having no solace for his disturbed mind. Of this time he says:\r\n\"I got a Bible, and began to read it. My conscience was awakened, and I\r\nbecame my accuser. I put the Bible away and determined to remain a good\r\nJew, but the wounds of my conscience and heart became putrifying sores.\r\nI tried to comfort myself that I had always lived a moral and blameless\r\nlife; but it was all in vain.\" At last his despair nearly drove him to\r\nsuicide, from which he was only saved by throwing himself on his knees\r\nin prayer. That night he was \"born again,\" and the next day, May 16,\r\n1839, he openly confessed his newly found faith. The change became known\r\nto the Jews. Arguments and threats, and even the offer from a brother to\r\nestablish him in business--all was in vain. The next year he went to\r\nBerlin, and after preparation was received into the Church of Christ, by\r\nPastor Kuntze, on June 6, 1841. Further trials from his family awaited\r\nhim, until he fled to Amsterdam, where Mr. Pauli, the Society's\r\nmissionary, asked him to assist in the mission. From that time, 1843,\r\nuntil May, 1900, when he died, his work was signally blessed, many Jews\r\nthrough his influence being baptized. He thus passed away \"as a shock of\r\ncorn cometh in in his season.\"\r\n\r\nBLOCH, Moritz (in Hungarian, Ballage Mór), born in Timova, 1816,\r\nreceived a Talmudic education, then studied at the University of Pesth,\r\nthen Orientalia at Paris. In 1841 he sent a petition to the Hungarian\r\nParliament, asking for the emancipation of the Jews. He translated the\r\nPentateuch and Joshua into Hungarian, adding exegetical notes. In 1843\r\nhe was baptized in Germany in a Lutheran Church. The next year he was\r\nappointed Professor at the Lyceum in Syarvas, Hungary. He was an author\r\nof several works on educational and theological topics, and edited, in\r\n1840, the \"Protestantische Kirchen und Schulbatt.\"\r\n\r\nBOCK, Wilhelm Isaac, a Jewish rabbi, after embracing Christianity,\r\ntaught Hebrew in Frankfort on the Oder, and published \"Abraham Jugels\r\nLekah Tob, or Catechism for Jews in German,\" Leipzig, 1694.\r\n\r\nBONAVENTURA, Meyer, a Jewish convert, wrote \"Das Judenthum in seinen\r\nGebeten, Gebrauchen, Gesetzen und Ceremonien,\" Regensburg, 1843.\r\n\r\nBONN, first master in a school, baptized at Königsberg in 19th century,\r\nis recorded to have been very zealous in the work of the German Home\r\nMission, and preached the Gospel.\r\n\r\nBORG, Ernest Maximilian, a Jew who held a similar position to Bock, was\r\nbaptized much earlier in Breslau (de le Roi, I. 212).\r\n\r\nBÖRLING, Pastor J. Jacob, born in 1802, in Slavito, Russia, five times\r\nexperienced as a child God's mercy when he was in danger of being\r\ndrowned. He devoted himself diligently to the study of rabbinic and\r\nKabbalistic lore, until this whole system surfeited him with disgust\r\nwhen he found that its votaries were far from being the saints they\r\npretended to be. In 1821, the missionaries Saltet and Betzner visited\r\nBerditscheff, where the family then resided. Börling received a tract\r\nfrom them, but his mother tore it in pieces. Later the missionary Moritz\r\narrived there, and as a born Jew he made a great impression upon\r\nBörling, so that he began to search the Scriptures, and at length was\r\nbaptized by Saltet, his first missionary acquaintance, in 1823. In 1825\r\nhe accompanied Joseph Wolff to Schuster on the Persian border. In 1828\r\nhe went alone to Persia, to rescue German subjects who were sold into\r\nslavery, in which self-denying mission he eventually succeeded. He then\r\nstudied in the mission house at Basel, and in 1834 he was appointed by\r\nthe Berlin Society as their missionary in that city. There he worked\r\nzealously till 1840, when he accepted the call to become pastor of a\r\nChurch in Bellowesch, in the government of Tschernigoff. Börling was the\r\nson-in-law of the missionary Goldberg, the brother-in-law of\r\nHausmeister. The latter wrote, \"Leben und Wirken des Pastors J. J.\r\nBörling.\" (Basel, 1852).\r\n\r\nBÖRNE, Karl Ludwig (Loeb Baruch), German political and literary writer,\r\nborn 1786 at Frankfort-on-the-Main, died in Paris, 1837. He was baptized\r\nin the Lutheran Church at Rödelheim, by Pastor Bertuah, on June 5th,\r\n1818. In 1819 he became editor of the \"Zeitung der Freien Stadt\r\nFrankfurt.\" Börne was a prolific writer. A complete edition of his\r\nworks, in 12 vols., was published at Hamburg in 1862.\r\n\r\nBRAHAM, John (Abraham), born in 1774, died 1856, a well-known musician\r\nin London, where he was as a Jew leader of the choir of the Great\r\nSynagogue, and became afterwards, as a Christian, especially popular for\r\nhis song, entitled \"The Death of Nelson.\" Of his children, a daughter\r\nbecame Countess Waldegrave, and later she married Lord Carlingford.\r\n\r\nBRANDON, a convert, educated at St. Chrischona, Basel, was sent by the\r\nScotch Church as missionary to Alexandria, in 1859. In 1862 he went to\r\nKhartum, and after receiving permission from King Theodore, he entered\r\nAbyssinia, and was partner with Flad and Stern in their labours and in\r\ntheir captivity. After the release of the captives, he was actively\r\nengaged in good work at Beyrout, Syria.\r\n\r\nBRANIS, a daughter of Rabbi Kempner, was baptized in 1826, out of pure\r\nconviction. Her old father was also inclined towards Christianity, but\r\ndied before he could come to a decision.\r\n\r\nBRANISS, Christlieb Julius, born in Breslau, 1792, died 1873. He became\r\nProfessor of Philosophy at Breslau in 1833. He was the author of several\r\nworks on philosophy and metaphysics. One only requires mentioning here,\r\n\"De Notione Philosophiae Christianae.\"\r\n\r\nBRENZ, Victorin Christophorus, was baptized in 1601, together with his\r\nparents and the whole family. His father, Samuel Frederick Brenz, is\r\nknown as the author of the \"Jüdischer Abgestreifter Schlangenbalg\" (\"The\r\nJewish Serpent's Skin Stripped\") against which Solomon Zebi Hirsch, of\r\nAufhausen, wrote \"Der Jüdische Theriak\" (\"The Jewish Theriak or\r\nAntidote\") Hanau, 1615. Brenz, junior, after finishing his theological\r\nstudies, quietly and patiently, served in 1624 as minister at\r\nUntermichelbach, receiving a stipend of 150 thaler, with which he had to\r\nsupport his wife and four children. Later he had the care of two\r\nchurches, and yet he had to work in the fields as a labourer to earn his\r\nliving. Then he had the care of seven parishes, in which he exhausted\r\nhis strength, and died at the age of 47, in 1642.\r\n\r\nBRILLIANT, a convert, laboured as an Evangelist among the Jews in the\r\nservice of the Free Church of Scotland at Amsterdam, in 1866.\r\n\r\nBROMET, M. S., a Dutch Jew, baptized in 1855, was very much persecuted\r\nby his brethren. He wrote several tracts, amongst which were--\"De\r\nWederkomst en de regeering van den Heere Jesus Christus,\" \"Kort\r\nOversicht van eenige gelijkenissen des Heeren,\" \"De erste opstonding in\r\nverband met de Wederkomst des Heeren,\" \"Het National herstel en de\r\nbekeering van Israel,\" \"Elischoa God is miyn heil,\" Amst. Doct.,\r\n1874-76.\r\n\r\nBRONKHORST, S. H. convert, student and missionary of the L.J.S., in\r\nAbyssinia 1859-1862, when he and Flad laboured together in Djenda.\r\n\r\nBRÜHL, John Henry, was born in 1823 at Schmiegel (Posen). He was sent to\r\nschool at a very early age, and, before he was five years old, was able\r\nto translate the greater part of the Hebrew Pentateuch into German. A\r\nshort account of the life of Christ about this time influenced him\r\ngreatly. Later on he used, with his father, to visit a Christian family,\r\nand through looking at the pictures in it he became interested in the\r\nGospels and the Acts of the Apostles, though he found the Epistles\r\nbeyond his youthful grasp. When about ten years old he was studying\r\nIsaiah, and was struck by the 53rd chapter; that which hitherto had been\r\na lurking suspicion became an absolute certainty, and the more so as he\r\nsaw how the principal Jewish commentators laboured in vain to prove that\r\nthis prophecy could not apply to Jesus of Nazareth. His growing\r\nconvictions of the truth of Christianity prevented his becoming a rabbi,\r\nwhich his parents earnestly desired, so he resolved to be a\r\nschoolmaster. During his course at the seminary, owing to the words of\r\nDr. Zahn, the director, he was convinced of the truth. Through the\r\nLondon Jews' Society's missionaries at Amsterdam, where he then went,\r\nhe decided to be a Christian. He came to London, where he entered the\r\nOperative Jewish Converts' Institution, and eventually was baptized in\r\n1846. Later on he passed through the Society's Missionary College, and\r\nin 1851 went to Baghdad, where he laboured successfully. In 1853 he was\r\nordained in Jerusalem. On his way back to Baghdad he preached to Jews,\r\nMohammedans and fire-worshippers, many of whom had never heard the\r\nGospel before. Many missionary journeys were made by him between 1854\r\nand 1864 through Persia and Kurdistan, leaving large numbers of\r\nbelievers in almost every place. After visiting England in 1856, when he\r\nreceived priest's orders and was married, he returned with the Rev. J.\r\nM. Eppstein to Baghdad, where they remained until 1866, when the mission\r\nwas given up, but not until there were numerous converts from both Jews\r\nand Mohammedans. The following year he was appointed to Lemberg, and in\r\n1871 to Vienna, and in spite of immense difficulties gained many\r\nfaithful believers in both these cities. In 1875 he became Principal of\r\nthe Operative Jewish Converts' Institution, where he remained for twelve\r\nyears, when he retired from active work. During this time 160 Jews\r\npassed through the Institution, 70 of whom he baptized. By his death, in\r\n1893, the Church and the world lost a great linguist, a good historian\r\nand mathematician, but, above all, a thorough and devoted Christian\r\nmissionary.\r\n\r\nBRUNNER, W., born in Brody, Galicia, in 1822. His parents were in good\r\ncircumstances. After the death of his father at the age of 90, he came\r\nto England, where he was converted and baptized by the Rev. Dr. Bailey,\r\nPrincipal of St. Aidan's College. He was afterwards prepared for\r\nmissionary work by the British Society, and laboured at Marseilles and\r\nin Switzerland. He had the privilege of bringing two brothers to the\r\nSaviour. He died in 1890.\r\n\r\nBUZIN, Rev. Paul Theodor Ludwig, born in Clecko (Posen), was baptized in\r\nSagord (Isle of Rügen), by Pastor Ockel. He then studied at Basel, and\r\neventually became Pastor of a Lutheran Church in the United States.\r\n\r\nCACHET, Rev. Lion, a Dutch Jewish merchant, embraced Christianity in\r\n1849, then studied theology and went to South Africa in 1858. He\r\nofficiated as pastor in different churches at the Cape and in Natal, and\r\nfounded eight new congregations. In 1876 he became pastor of the\r\nNetherland Reformed Church at Velliersdorf. He took a great interest in\r\nmissionary work among the Jews, which he promoted through the newspaper,\r\n\"Zuid Afrikaanische Stem voor en tot Israel.\"\r\n\r\nCALMAN, Erasmus Scott, born in Lithuania, became a convert to\r\nChristianity early in the nineteenth century. In 1839 he assisted\r\nNicolayson in his work in Jerusalem, travelling with him all over\r\nPalestine, and being well received by the Jews. Later in life he took up\r\nhis residence in London. A friend having left him a large legacy to\r\nenable him to work independently, he availed himself of just so much of\r\nit as would meet the wants of the poorest pauper. He left the money\r\ngiven him for his own comforts, probably with a large increase through\r\nhis savings, to trustees for the support of aged poor Hebrew Christians.\r\nCalman was a learned as well as a good man, and published a treatise\r\nentitled: \"Some of the Errors of Modern Judaism contrasted with the Word\r\nof God,\" and another entitled, \"The Morrow of the Sabbath.\"\r\n\r\nCANTONI, Giuseppi (Jacob), a Jew from Trieste, won for Christ by the\r\nRev. Lewis Way, was baptized in the Chapel of the Dutch Consul at\r\nSmyrna, before a large congregation, in 1832.\r\n\r\nCAPADOSE, Dr. Abraham, born at Amsterdam, 1795, of a Portuguese family,\r\ndied there December 16th, 1874. Here is his autobiography, which he sent\r\nto his friend, Ridley Herschell, in London:--\"I will no longer delay,\r\ndear friends, to comply with your request that I would communicate in\r\nwriting the mode in which it pleased God to bring me to the knowledge of\r\nHimself, and to lead me out of darkness into His marvellous light.\r\n\r\n\"Being deeply sensible that it was not of myself I sought after God, but\r\nthat my compassionate Lord came to seek me when I was lost, it would be\r\nfalse modesty if I were now to withhold an account which, when verbally\r\ncommunicated, interested and edified many dear friends, who therein\r\ntraced the great love of the Saviour towards a poor sinner like me, and\r\nthus were led to ascribe all the glory to Him whose name is blessed for\r\nevermore. May this glory be the only object I shall keep in view in this\r\naccount! Such is the sincere desire of my heart; and I ask of God to\r\nguide my pen in truth and sincerity, that I may be kept from all\r\nself-seeking, into which the necessity of speaking of myself might\r\nbetray me.\r\n\r\n\"Although I was by birth a Portuguese Israelite, I was by no means\r\nzealous for the religion of my fathers. My education was rather moral\r\nthan religious; and though taught to hate vice, and to love what the\r\nworld calls virtue, I owe it entirely to the grace of God that at an\r\nafter period I was preserved from open impiety.\r\n\r\n\"At an early age I was captivated by science and literature. I was fond\r\nof balls, plays, and every worldly amusement; but study afforded me\r\nstill greater satisfaction. I became acquainted with the works of\r\nVoltaire and Rousseau at an early period of my life; but their false\r\nprinciples, and still more, the frightful consequences of their system,\r\nas exhibited before my eyes in the history of the French revolution,\r\npreserved me, by the divine mercy, from their hurtful influence. My\r\nparents having destined me for the medical profession, I considered it\r\nmy duty to acquire the knowledge requisite for this calling; but I felt\r\nmore inclination for the study of the theoretical sciences, and for\r\nphilosophic research.\r\n\r\n\"My friends were nearly all young men who made an outward profession of\r\nChristianity; but the Lord had given me one friend among my near\r\nrelatives.[8] As we were both Israelites, and had been intimate from\r\nchildhood, our views on all subjects were very similar. (Dr. Capadose\r\nhere proceeds to state their intercourse with Bilderdyk, which is the\r\nsame as the account given by Da Costa, see page 172). The religious\r\nelement, if I may call it so, had not as yet entered into my soul. In my\r\nearly childhood, it is true, I had often felt an undefined need of\r\nprayer; and when about nine years' old, had asked my parents to give me\r\na book of prayers, either in the French or Dutch language, that I might\r\nunderstand them better.[9] I strongly urged my younger brothers and\r\nsisters to the same practice; and this was the more remarkable as I had\r\nvery seldom seen any one engaged in prayer in my father's house. From\r\nthat time, amid all the changes of my outward life, I never omitted the\r\nperformance of this duty; and until my conversion to Christianity, it\r\nconstituted all my religious worship. The prayer I used ended with these\r\nremarkable words:--'I wait for Thy salvation, O Lord!' I have preserved\r\nthe book containing it, and never look upon it without adoring the\r\ngoodness of that 'God of my salvation,' who has condescended to bestow\r\nupon me, at a matured age, the blessing that the child of nine years'\r\nold, hardly knowing what he asked, failed not to solicit from Him every\r\nnight before he lay down to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n[8] M. Da Costa.\r\n\r\n\r\n[9] It is the general custom of the Jews to use the Hebrew language in\r\nprivate as well as public prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"During the period in which I was engaged in my studies, I occasionally\r\nexperienced very peculiar emotions. A poor woman used to sing psalms in\r\nthe street on Saturday evenings, to excite the compassion of the\r\npassengers; and more than once have I left my books to listen to her,\r\noverpowered by emotions which I could neither comprehend nor describe.\r\nAt the theatre also, when _Joseph in Egypt_ was represented, my tears\r\nflowed at the sound of the morning prayer, which was imitated from the\r\nHebrew. At the synagogue, however, which, for the sake of decorum, I\r\nstill frequented, nothing had the least power to interest me. On the\r\ncontrary, the unmeaning ceremonies which appealed not to the heart, the\r\nwant of reverence, the bawling noise, the discordant singing, and\r\nlastly, the employment of a language of which three-fourths of the\r\ncongregation did not understand a word, disgusted me so much, that I\r\nceased to attend it regularly, having always a great aversion to\r\nhypocrisy.\r\n\r\n\"In the mean time, as if the tempter had foreseen what was afterwards to\r\ntake place, he induced my friend and myself to change our mode of life.\r\nWe disliked half measures, and could not endure the modern Judaism which\r\nchooses at its pleasure to dispense with the requirements of the Mosaic\r\nlaw; we therefore resolved to become Israelites indeed, rigidly\r\nobserving all the prescriptions of the law, and thus compelling\r\nChristians to entertain a higher respect for the Jewish religion.\r\nNational pride was now our ruling motive. In this spirit, and with these\r\nviews, we began assiduously to read the Bible. But, oh! the shame and\r\nwretchedness of the unconverted heart! We could not get beyond Genesis.\r\nConstant ridicule and jesting, and oftentimes even blasphemy (Lord,\r\nenter not into judgment with us!) were upon our lips instead of prayer;\r\nso that I at length told my friend it was better to abandon our reading\r\naltogether than to engage in it in such a manner.\r\n\r\n\"Thus our proposed plan vanished like smoke. My term of study was nearly\r\ncompleted. This was in 1818. I took my degrees in medicine, left the\r\nuniversity, and returned to my native city Amsterdam, full of bright\r\nprospects for the future. I had an uncle there, one of the first\r\nphysicians in Holland, a learned man, and highly esteemed by the\r\nprincipal families. Having no children, he took me into his house and\r\nadopted me as his son and successor. I was thus introduced at once to an\r\nextensive circle of acquaintance; kind and respectable, it is true, but\r\nwith whom Christianity was a mere outward profession accompanied by an\r\nentirely worldly life. None of these ever spoke to me on the subject of\r\nChristianity. I have even heard some of my young friends make a boast of\r\ntheir infidelity, and speak without reverence of the Lord Jesus Christ.\r\nI once expressed my astonishment at this, and said, that though I did\r\nnot believe in Jesus, I thought that those who worshipped Him, and did\r\nnot consider Him to be God, were mere idolaters. A young physician who\r\nwas of the party, who was afterwards savingly converted to God, told me\r\nsome years after, how much ashamed he felt at the time, when receiving\r\nsuch a reproof from an Israelite.\r\n\r\n\"In the midst of constant occupation, in the diligent pursuit of\r\nscientific knowledge, I yet felt an aching void within. I had been\r\nsubject from childhood to an oppression of the chest, which made me pass\r\nmany sleepless nights; and in these hours of wakefulness I often\r\nthought, 'Why am I upon the earth? Why was I created a man? Should I not\r\nbe a thousand times happier if I were one of the lower animals? I should\r\nnot then endure what I now suffer in my body and in my soul.' Often did\r\nI cry out, 'O that this day were my last!' Yet I was not disquieted on\r\naccount of my sins, else I should have shuddered at the thought of\r\ndeath; I was under the burden and curse of sin, without knowing it, or\r\nseeking for the remedy.\r\n\r\n\"One day I went to pay a visit to my friend who had been lately married.\r\nHe had just received a letter from the celebrated professor already\r\nmentioned. 'Would you like me to read it to you,' said he, 'together\r\nwith some beautiful verses he has addressed to me?' I gladly assented to\r\nthe proposal. The verses, in which he described, with power and feeling,\r\nthe glorious hopes of Israel, concluded with the words, 'Friend, be a\r\nChristian, and I die content.' At these words, which he pronounced in an\r\nunder tone, my indignation was roused; my friend, it appeared to me, was\r\nless shocked than he ought to have been. 'Take care,' said I, 'there is\r\na plan laid to seduce us.' I left him immediately.\r\n\r\n\"This occupied my thoughts all the rest of the day. I could not imagine\r\nhow a man of such profound learning could believe the Christian\r\nreligion. From that day, however, both my friend and myself began\r\nattentively to examine the Word of God; and when we walked together we\r\nconversed on those passages that had struck us most. Having begun with\r\nthe Gospel of Matthew, it was striking to me to perceive, that so far\r\nfrom seeking to subvert the authority of the Old Testament, he made it\r\nthe basis whereon to build the Gospel of Christ.\r\n\r\n\"My friend and I spent several months in this way, becoming daily more\r\ninterested in our researches. At length, with thoughts and feelings very\r\ndifferent from those which formerly possessed us, we again determined to\r\nread the Scriptures together. For this purpose we retired to a room in\r\nmy father's house; and I can never think without emotion on these\r\nhallowed hours which we spent together, as in the presence of the God of\r\nour fathers. Our interest increased as we proceeded. My mind, wearied\r\nwith vain speculations, now saw a new and boundless field open before\r\nit, towards which it was irresistibly attracted; and thus before I had\r\never heard of the electing love of God, I had experienced the power by\r\nwhich He draws to Christ those souls whom He designs to bless. This\r\nstudy of the word of God became at length the most urgent desire of my\r\nsoul. Merely to know the truth did not satisfy me: I felt that I must\r\nreally possess it, and live on its substance. I understood not then the\r\nwork that was going on within me; but I occasionally experienced moments\r\nof delight arising from the conviction that divine assistance and\r\nprotection accompanied the course I was pursuing.\r\n\r\n\"One night, when reading the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, I was so\r\nmuch struck with its resemblance to the account of the sufferings of\r\nChrist which I had read in the Gospels, that I was almost convinced I\r\nhad got another Bible instead of my own; being scarcely able to believe\r\nthat this chapter, which may be truly entitled an abstract of the\r\nGospel, was really in the Old Testament. 'How,' thought I, 'can any Jew,\r\nafter reading this chapter, doubt that Jesus Christ is the promised\r\nMessiah!' Whence could this strong conviction arise? I had often read\r\nthis chapter before; but now I read it with the light of the Spirit of\r\nGod. From this moment I recognized Christ as the promised Messiah, and\r\nthis gave an entirely new character to our meditations on the Word of\r\nGod. It was the dawn of a glorious day to our souls, the light of which\r\nincreased more and more, enlightening our minds, warming our hearts, and\r\neven then bestowing upon us unspeakable consolation. Many of the enigmas\r\nof life, which had hitherto puzzled and distressed me, were now\r\nexplained; everything seemed to revive around me, and the object and\r\ninterest of my life were entirely changed. Happy days, thus gladdened by\r\na sense of the Master's presence! Never can I forget them!\r\n\r\n\"I believe it was by divine direction that my friend and I did not\r\ndisclose to any one what was passing in our minds; and that we confined\r\nourselves to the study of God's Word, laying aside all other books\r\nexcept Heydeck's 'Defence of the Christian Faith.' This learned man had\r\nbeen a Rabbi in Germany, and having embraced the Romish religion, was\r\nmade Professor of Oriental languages at Madrid. This book, written with\r\ngreat talent, and much knowledge of Scripture, is a defence of\r\nChristianity against Rationalism. Its perusal was useful to us in two\r\nways; we found that the powerful logic with which he combated the\r\nreasonings of Voltaire and Rousseau, entirely deserted him when he\r\nattempted to defend Popery against the doctrines of the Reformation.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever I had any leisure in the morning, I used to shut myself up to\r\nread the Word of God, as I dared not peruse it in my uncle's presence.\r\nOne day I had been particularly considering the following passage in\r\nIsa. vii. 14, 'Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall\r\ncall his name Immanuel.' On going down stairs I found a Jewish\r\nphysician, a friend of my uncle's, waiting for him in the ante-room. He\r\nwas turning over the leaves of a new edition of the Bible. 'There,' said\r\nhe, 'is a fatal passage we cannot easily wrest from the Christians.' It\r\nwas the very passage I had been meditating upon. My soul was deeply\r\nmoved, and I again perceived the guiding hand of my God. 'Why, then,' I\r\nreplied, 'should we not confess the truth?' My uncle now entered, and\r\nenquired what subject we were discussing. The physician informed him;\r\nand knowing my uncle to be deeply versed in the rabbinical writings,\r\nasked him what the Rabbis say on the passage. 'Alas!' said my uncle,\r\n'only a mass of nonsense.' With a beating heart I listened to this\r\nadmission; and inwardly thanked God for having permitted me to hear\r\nthese words from the lips of one whose rabbinical learning made him to\r\nbe considered as an authority by the Jews.\r\n\r\n\"All these various circumstances convinced me more and more that truth\r\nis to be found in Christianity alone. I could not now be satisfied with\r\nmere knowledge, I longed for love. Then it was that the sun of\r\nrighteousness shed abroad in our hearts, not only the light that\r\nilluminates, but the quickening warmth that enables the soul to live the\r\nlife of God. I saw that love had led the Saviour to seek me. I perceived\r\nalso my own sinful and miserable condition; but this feeling seemed\r\nabsorbed in a sense of the divine love. In Christ I found my life,--the\r\ncentre of all my thoughts and affections,--the sole object that could\r\nfill the void in my heart,--the key of all mysteries,--the principal of\r\nall true philosophy, yea the _truth_ itself.\r\n\r\n\"I daily felt more and more the necessity of openly avowing my\r\nsentiments. I can record, to the glory of God, that the certainty of\r\nlosing a considerable property, if I declared myself a Christian (which\r\nthe event has confirmed), never for a moment entered into the scruples\r\nwhich made me hesitate. I dreaded the effect of the disclosures on the\r\nkind relative who had treated me as his son; on whose choleric\r\ntemperament it might produce an impression that, at his advanced age,\r\nmight be fatal. Doubtless, had my faith been stronger, I should have\r\nbroken through every obstacle; but I could only suffer in silence, at\r\nthe same time earnestly praying to God to come to my aid, and open a way\r\nbefore me.\r\n\r\n\"And the God of mercy attended to the voice of my supplication. It was\r\nmy uncle's custom to read the newspaper aloud after dinner. One day when\r\nI was sitting opposite to him in a state of great dejection, he read\r\nout the following news from Hamburg:--'We have just witnessed a very\r\ninteresting event. A Rabbi, after having announced to his\r\nco-religionists in the synagogue, that an attentive examination of the\r\nprophecies had convinced him that Messiah has already come, and having\r\nmade a confession of the Christian faith, was baptized a few days since\r\nin this city, and received as a minister of the gospel.' On reading\r\nthis, my uncle said the following words, which the position I was then\r\nin rendered so remarkable: 'If this man has acted from self-interest, he\r\nis worthy of contempt: but if from conviction, he ought to be\r\nrespected.' Oh, Christians! You who can sympathize in the feelings of\r\nthose like-minded with you, need I describe to you what passed in my\r\nmind at this solemn moment? In a transport of joy I fell on the neck of\r\nthe venerable old man, saying, 'Yes, uncle, and it is God who makes you\r\nfeel thus; know that he whom you love with the tenderness of a father,\r\nis in the same case with this Rabbi!' I pronounced these words in such\r\nviolent agitation, and in a tone so unusual, that my poor uncle thought\r\nI was out of my senses. He left the room for a few minutes, as if to\r\nallow me to recover myself; and at his return began to speak on a\r\ndifferent subject.\r\n\r\n\"I could see that although my uncle was annoyed at what had passed, he\r\ndid not attach to my words the importance they deserved. I therefore\r\nresolved, after having strengthened myself in God, to make the same\r\ndeclaration to him the following day. He could no longer shut his eyes\r\nto what had taken place; and a heart-rending scene followed. He beat his\r\nbreast, lamented that ever he was born, and exclaimed, in the bitterness\r\nof his soul, that I was about to bring his grey hairs with sorrow to the\r\ngrave. His reproaches went to my heart; but the Lord strengthened and\r\ncomforted me, and enabled me to shew the dear old man such marks of\r\ntenderness as at length somewhat soothed him.\r\n\r\n\"When the change became known to my family, they first used gentle means\r\nwith me, in the hope that these new notions might pass away; but finding\r\nI grew bold, and ventured to preach the gospel to them, they resorted to\r\nharsh treatment. It was a season of deep trial to my soul. This state of\r\nthings increased the ardent desire I felt publicly to confess Christ. My\r\nfamily wished me to go into Germany, or some other country, for this\r\npurpose; but to this I objected, lest it should appear as if I were\r\nashamed of the step I was about to take. My friend and I at length\r\ndecided on Leyden as the place where we should receive the rite of\r\nbaptism. The 20th of October, 1822, was the day so ardently desired, on\r\nwhich we were admitted members of the Church of Christ. Kneeling in the\r\npresence of the congregation, before the God of our fathers, who is the\r\ntrue God--Father, Son, and Holy Spirit--we had the unspeakable joy,\r\nunworthy sinners as we were, to confess before the Christian Church, the\r\nblessed name of that great God and Saviour who had come to seek and save\r\nus when we were lost. Glory be to God.\"\r\n\r\nAmong Capadose's writings, the most noteworthy are: (1) \"Aan mijne\r\ngeloofsgenooten in de Ned. Heb. Gem.,\" The Hague, 1843. (2)\r\n\"Overdenkingen over Israel's Roeping en Toekomst,\" Amsterdam, 1843. (3)\r\n\"Rome en Jerusalem,\" Utrecht, 1851.\r\n\r\nCAPLAN, Rev. W. H., was a native of the Baltic provinces. He was\r\nconverted to Christianity through the reading of the New Testament,\r\nwhich he received from a friend at home. He then went to London for the\r\npurpose of being able the more easily to make a public profession of his\r\nfaith, and was baptized there about 1876. In 1877 he became assistant to\r\nthe Rev. Theodore Meyer, of the Presbyterian Mission in Whitechapel.\r\nAfter a few years he studied at King's College, and was ordained to the\r\nministry of the Church of England in 1885. Then he became curate in\r\nseveral churches in England, and finally emigrated to Canada, where he\r\nis doing good work in the Canadian Church.\r\n\r\nCARLTON, Rev. S. J., a native of Silesia, baptized in the Irish\r\nPresbyterian Mission at Hamburg, about 1892. Subsequently he joined the\r\nChurch of England, studied at Ayerst Hall, Cambridge, was L.J.S.\r\nmissionary curate at St. Benet's, Stepney, then curate at St. Jude's,\r\nMildmay, 1901-4; St. Peter's, Cricklewood, 1904-6; St. Mary Magdalene,\r\nPeckham, 1906-8; and vicar of All Saints, Camberwell, from 1908.\r\n\r\nCARRET, Ludwig, a convert who lived at the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, wrote a Hebrew letter giving an account of the history of his\r\nconversion. This letter appeared in the Appendix in Buxtorf's Synagogue\r\nJudaica (de le Roi), but not in all editions.\r\n\r\nCARO, Pastor F., convert and missionary of the Berlin Society in 1845-8,\r\nhad the privilege of baptizing a Jewish lady in her ninetieth year, in\r\nthe presence of all her children, one of whom was the above-named\r\nBranis.\r\n\r\nCARO, Regierungsrath in Merseburg, is recorded as having rendered the\r\nGovernment good service, especially in the educational department, in\r\nthe 19th century, and that he was a devoted Christian.\r\n\r\nCASPARI, Carl Paul. Norway during the nineteenth century found her most\r\npre-eminent witness for Christ and defender of Christianity in that son\r\nof Israel whose name is mentioned above. Carl Paul Caspari was born at\r\nDessau 1814. His parents were orthodox Jews, and his father was a\r\nmerchant there. In this city, which through Moses Mendelssohn has become\r\nso celebrated, the Jewish community influenced many of its citizens in a\r\nremarkable manner, on account of their ability and intelligence. They\r\nestablished a Jewish seminary, which was called after Prince Francis,\r\n\"The Francis School.\" It gained a great reputation, and even attracted\r\nChristian pupils. German services were held in the synagogue, at that\r\nperiod an unheard-of innovation. The religious instruction in the school\r\nwas given in an enlightened spirit. Caspari imbibed this influence, and\r\nwhen he attended the Gymnasium it obtained complete control over him. In\r\n1834 he went to Leipsig, in order to study Oriental languages. Here he\r\nread the Old Testament diligently, but he found in it only the teaching\r\nhe had formerly received. The New Testament he could not accept.\r\nHowever, he was animated by a strong sense of duty, and he inscribed on\r\nhis desk the motto, \"Thou canst, therefore thou oughtest.\" Yet he soon\r\nbecame convinced that his will was a very feeble instrument. At this\r\nperiod, Granel, who had formerly been his schoolmate at Dessau, and who\r\nafterwards was so well known as the Superintendent of the Saxon Foreign\r\nMissions, became Caspari's faithful friend and wise counsellor. Granel\r\npersuaded him to carefully read the New Testament. He opened the book at\r\nthe Acts of the Apostles and read of Paul's persecution by the Jews. He\r\nwas impressed with the truthfulness of the narrative, and so he\r\nconcluded to continue his reading. When he reached the Gospels, the\r\nwords of Christ and the accounts of His wonderful miracles greatly\r\naffected him. The thought came to him. \"Perhaps Jesus can also help me\r\nout of all this misery which I find in my soul,\" and, as he a year\r\nbefore his death said, \"I came to Him as to my living Saviour--just as\r\nin the days of His flesh men sought comfort from Him.\" Pastor Wolf, of\r\nLeipsig, and the young theologian, Franz Delitzsch, afterwards the\r\ncelebrated professor, together with Granel, dealt with him faithfully in\r\nthis time of struggle, and because the young man was sincere the\r\nconflict ended in his victory. At Pentecost, in 1838, he received from\r\nthe same Pastor Zehme, in Leipsig, who had previously baptized Freidrich\r\nAdolph Philippi, Holy Baptism. He now discontinued his former studies\r\nand devoted himself to the study of theology, giving especial attention\r\nto the Old Testament. After leaving the university he was at first a\r\nprivate scholar, and as such wrote an exposition of the prophecy of\r\nObadiah, and also the first volume of an Arabic grammar, which was\r\ntranslated into several languages, and is in use to-day. He declined a\r\ncall to the Königsberg university, because he wished to work only in a\r\nLutheran institution. He received a call to such an one in 1847, namely,\r\nto the Norwegian university at Christiania, where he displayed his great\r\npowers as a theologian. He wrote expositions of many books of the Old\r\nTestament, and performed especial service in editing the newly revised\r\nBible in Norwegian, which is now used in the churches of that country.\r\nThe question of the signification of the Apostles' Creed, which through\r\nGrundtvig, had greatly agitated the Northern Evangelical churches, led\r\nhim in 1858 to a thorough investigation of this ancient Confession of\r\nFaith. He decided that the Creed undoubtedly had its formation in the\r\ntimes of the Apostles, that it had become part of the life of the\r\nChurch, but that the Holy Scriptures alone had been and must remain the\r\nstandard of belief, and to which all the teachers of the Church from its\r\nfoundation until Grundtvig had adhered. The Apostles' Creed had not\r\nalways had this authority, nor is it the direct word of Jesus Christ,\r\nbut it stands for an expression of the primitive faith, and he who\r\ndisputes its truth should not be considered a Christian. Caspari\r\nreceived abundant thanks for his labours. The city of Erlangen bestowed\r\nupon him the title of \"Doctor of Theology.\" Many philosophical societies\r\nelected him to their membership, and Swedish and Norwegian Orders gave\r\nhim honors. He ever retained true affection for his own Jewish people,\r\nand often spoke eloquently in behalf of Jewish missions. In 1865 he\r\nbecame President of the Norwegian Central Committee for Jewish missions,\r\nand later a Director of the Lutheran Central Societies at Leipsic. He\r\nserved with especial diligence at the Students' Missionary Association\r\nat Christiania, where a conference was held over Jewish missions. He\r\ndivided his discourse into four points, including the following\r\nquestions and answers:\r\n\r\nI.--Is Jewish mission work necessary? Yes; because without it the\r\nmajority of the Jews would never be reached by the preaching of the\r\nGospel.\r\n\r\nII.--How shall they be converted? By establishing in every Church\r\nsocieties of earnest Christians, who shall support proselytes from\r\nJudaism as missionaries among their own people.\r\n\r\nIII.--How shall these missionaries carry on their work? Not by dispute\r\nand argument, which create only intellectual knowledge, but through the\r\npromulgation of the way of salvation, must the Jews embrace the truths\r\nof Christianity, through which Christians also are converted.\r\n\r\nIV.--How are the converts to be treated? Possibly they might primarily\r\nbe organized into circles, in order to serve as leaven among their\r\nfriends, but much depends upon their various former environments.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a Jewish national existence greatly impressed him, and he\r\nclung firmly to this hope for Israel's future. In 1891 he had the\r\npleasure of appointing the first Norwegian Jewish missionary. After a\r\nremarkable, important and richly blessed activity for the Church of\r\nChrist, he fell asleep in 1892. Professor Bang called him \"the Teacher\r\nof all Scandinavia,\" and testified that his death should be considered\r\nas an historical Church calamity. Caspari himself cherished but one\r\nambition, to live and die in favour with Christ Jesus, and depended to\r\nthe last on the Saviour's word, \"Him that cometh unto Me, I will in no\r\nwise cast out.\"\r\n\r\nSome of Caspari's works are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) \"Commentar über Obadja,\" Leipzig, 1842, followed by (2) \"Beiträge\r\nzur Einleitung in das Buch Jesaia.\" (3) \"Untersuchungen über den Syrisch\r\nEphraimitischen Krieg unter Jotham und Ahas,\" Christiania, 1849. (4)\r\n\"Commentar zu Micha,\" ib., 1852. (5) \"Theile des Jesaia seit 1853.\" (6)\r\n\"Zur Einführung in das Buch Daniel,\" Leipzig, 1869.

Selig Cassel, to give\r\nhim his Jewish name, was born at Glogau, in Silesia, on February 27th,\r\n1821, of Jewish parents. He was educated at the Gymnasia of Glogau and\r\nSchweidnitz, and subsequently at the university of Berlin, where he made\r\na special study of history as a pupil of the famous historian, Dr.\r\nRanke.\r\n\r\nCassel took his degree at Berlin and Licentiatus Theologiæ in due\r\ncourse, and received the faculty for headmaster for all classes of the\r\ngymnasium in Latin, Greek, theology, history, geography and German\r\nliterature. He then, for a time, was on the journalistic staff of the\r\n\"Constitutionelle Zeitung\" in Berlin. Afterwards, in 1850, Cassel went\r\nto Erfurt, where he was the editor of the \"Erfurter Zeitung\" from 1850\r\nto 1856.\r\n\r\nHis Christian friends, and especially, according to his own statement,\r\nhis study of the history of Israel, led him to Christianity, which he\r\nembraced in 1855, being baptized at Büssleben, a village near Erfurt, on\r\nMay 28, and receiving the names \"Paulus Stephanus.\" Every year\r\nsubsequently he was wont to celebrate this \"second birthday,\" as he\r\ncalled it, amidst his friends and congregation.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the second period of Cassel's life, as a renowned\r\nChristian writer, preacher and orator. For a few years Cassel remained\r\nin the town, where the great change in his life had taken place, and\r\nbecame custodian of the public library and secretary of the \"Erfurt\r\nAcademy.\" He was then called to Berlin by the Prime Minister, who\r\nentrusted him with the editorship of the official \"Deutsche Reform.\" He\r\nresigned this post in six months' time to return to his beloved books\r\nand studies at Erfurt.\r\n\r\nAt this time honours were showered upon him. King Frederick William IV.\r\nof Prussia honoured him with the title of \"Professor.\" The University of\r\nErlangen conferred on him the degree of \"Licentiatus Theologiæ.\"\r\nAfterwards, in Vienna, Cassel obtained that of \"Doctor Theologiæ\"\r\n(Doctor of Divinity). In 1859 he returned to Berlin and delivered\r\npublic lectures, which were more and more largely attended and\r\nappreciated by both Jews and Gentiles. These lectures made him known\r\nthroughout the capital and the country.\r\n\r\nDr. Cassel was elected a member of the \"Landtag,\" the Prussian\r\nParliament, in 1866, and became a prominent member of the Conservative\r\nparty. As this took him too much from his literary work, he soon laid\r\nthis mandate down.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, the third and most famous portion of Cassel's life commenced,\r\nwhen the Society appointed him their missionary in Berlin and minister\r\nof Christ Church, a stately Gothic building, with over a thousand\r\nsittings, erected by the Society in the Wilhelmstrasse, in 1864.\r\n\r\nFor twenty-three years many children of Israel heard the Gospel from Dr.\r\nCassel's lips both in Berlin and other places of Germany, and indeed of\r\nEurope. The good done by means of his sermons and lectures can never be\r\nfully estimated; and, in addition to this, numbers of Jews were\r\ninfluenced in a Christian direction by his numerous publications.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible for us to follow the indefatigable missionary in\r\nhis multifarious activities in Berlin and in Germany generally during\r\nthese busy years; but we may be allowed to quote from a published letter\r\nwhich he addressed in 1887 to English friends, entitled, \"Thoughts on\r\nthe Jewish Mission\":\r\n\r\n\"Invitations came to give lectures in places at a distance. A dear\r\nfriend of mine shewed me in 1860 a map of Germany, on which he marked\r\nall the towns in which I have lectured. Since then I have delivered\r\nover a thousand original lectures in Berlin and elsewhere. God's hand\r\nhas guided me everywhere. My journeys have extended from Amsterdam to\r\nBuda-Pesth. I always had an attentive audience, and the poorer people in\r\nboth large and small towns heard the Word with gladness--nay, even with\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"During the anti-Semitic agitation, such journeys for the purpose of\r\ndelivering lectures were more extensive. I had then become known through\r\nmy defence of Gospel charity, even in circles which were not outwardly\r\nknown as Christian. The meetings which were held at the period resembled\r\nmore nearly the ideal at which I aimed. A considerable number of persons\r\nlistened to the lectures, who had completely turned their backs on the\r\nChurch.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of his ministerial and missionary work in Christ Church, the\r\ndoctor said:\r\n\r\n\"The special blessing of the Church consisted in the regular exposition\r\nof the _Old_ Testament. It has been my custom to expound the Old\r\nTestament every Sunday evening, from the first Sunday I came into office\r\n(Jan. 5th, 1868) up to the present time. It was the first time in Berlin\r\nthat this was made a practice. There were, therefore, from the very\r\nbeginning hearers, consisting of Jews and earnest Christians. Those\r\nexpository sermons have been the greatest blessing, and have specially\r\nunited me to the congregation.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Cassel baptized 262 Jews in Christ Church; amongst them\r\ndoctors, authors, merchants, nearly all educated persons. But, as he\r\nsaid, \"I am not fond of statistics. I sow the seed, but do not stop to\r\nask how much may be the fruit.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Cassel was an ardent lover of his own people. \"Though he has left\r\nus, he was by no means our enemy. He still fights against those who hate\r\nthe Jews,\" said the \"Jewish Chronicle.\" It was he who raised his voice\r\nagainst Stöcker in Berlin, and endeavoured by voice and pen to soften\r\ndown the excitement and anger of German Protestants, and to secure the\r\npeace of his former brethren in the faith.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1891, when he retired from his duties, Dr. Cassel did\r\nnot cease to preach, wherever an occasion offered, and he continued to\r\nwrite. So great was his love and zeal that he could not forego\r\ninstructing and baptizing Jews who wished to become members of the\r\nChurch of Christ through his instrumentality. The number of his converts\r\nmust exceed some hundreds. Many of them were in high positions, and\r\nresiding in various parts of the world.\r\n\r\nDr. Cassel's death took place, after great sufferings, on December 23rd,\r\n1893, his last words being, \"Wo ist denn das Himmelreich?\" His funeral\r\nwas held on December 27th in the afternoon. In Christ Church, where the\r\ncoffin had been placed before the communion-table, a funeral sermon was\r\npreached by the Rev. Pastor Weser from St. John i. 12. The Rev. Dr.\r\nDryander, the General Superintendent of the Lutheran community, also\r\naddressed the congregation. After the service within the sacred edifice\r\nthe obsequies were completed, in the presence of a large concourse of\r\nfriends, at the old Jerusalem Cemetery, where Dr. Cassel's mortal\r\nremains lie in their last resting-place.\r\n\r\nWe append a few testimonies to the life, example, and powerful influence\r\nof Dr. Cassel:\r\n\r\nMr. C. Urbschat, of Königsberg, who for several years worked under Dr.\r\nCassel in Berlin, wrote of his labours:--\r\n\r\n\"Professer Cassel was a highly educated missionary, and showed\r\nextraordinary ability in influencing the higher classes of Jews in\r\nfavour of Christianity by his lectures and by his pleadings on their\r\nbehalf. He was a man of profound learning, of great diligence, and of\r\nrestless zeal in propagating the Gospel of his Master amongst Jews and\r\nChristians.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums\" said:--\"When the anti-Semites\r\nbegan to show themselves, Cassel remembered his origin, and opposed the\r\nleaders, Stöcker, Wagner, and others with great decision and manliness.\r\nIt was this manly action that gives us some satisfaction for his\r\ndesertion of the parental religion. We have to judge this apostasy very\r\ndifferently from that of many others in former and present times, as he\r\ndid not forsake his old creed for any worldly reason, or to get honours\r\nand position, but rather because he followed a mystical line of thought.\r\nGod alone can judge the veracity and purity of his life; we dare not.\r\n'Peace be to his ashes!'\"\r\n\r\nOf the two brothers who, though divided in life, died about the same\r\ntime, the _Jewish Chronicle_ remarked:--\"The deaths of David and Paulus\r\n(formerly Selig) Cassel remove two brothers, both of whom had won a\r\nplace for themselves among the honoured names of Jewish scholarship....\r\nPaulus was the greater man of the two, a scholar and writer of a higher\r\ntype, and his works will live. He took a worthy part in the struggle\r\nagainst anti-Semitism. Paulus Cassel was perhaps the first man to\r\nrecognise what was really meant by writing a history of the Jews.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Dr. Cassel's numerous converts, baptized by him in 1870, sent the\r\nfollowing most touching tribute to his memory:--\"There was no way of his\r\nlife in which he failed to shine. Study and knowledge sealed in his\r\nheart the great truths of religion. His was the faith which is clothed\r\nin wisdom; his the wisdom which is hallowed by faith. His faith was to\r\nhim, as it should be to all of us, an armed angel. His affectionate\r\nheart not only throbbed with love for his own kindred, but was alive to\r\nsympathy with those who needed it. I always found him benevolent and\r\nsingularly gentle. He taught the world that the Jew, hitherto despised,\r\nmust be despised no more; he conquered a place in society, in the\r\nhighest society--the intellectual circle--for the people of his faith.\r\nAnd this victory he won, not by dint of clamour, or falseness, or\r\nobstrusive self-assertion, but by the force of his own intellectual\r\npowers, his unsullied integrity, his admirable character. Dr. Cassel\r\ngave mankind a useful lesson, a touching example, a glorious spectacle:\r\nhe showed how a Christian Jew lives! His knowledge was the altar on\r\nwhich he stood to worship the great God-man! History confirms the truth,\r\nwhich the Psalmist, whose music he loved, taught mankind ages ago--that,\r\n'The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.'\"\r\n\r\nThe industry of Dr. Cassel was truly prodigious, and was especially\r\nevidenced by the large number and character of his writings.\r\n\r\nA complete list of all his books and pamphlets would fill a large space,\r\nso mention can be made only of his more important writings,\r\nnamely:--\"Juden Geschichte\" in Ersch and Grüber (1847), \"Magyarische\r\nAltertumer\" (1848), \"Von Warschau bis Olmutz\" (1851), \"Thüringische\r\nOrtsnamen\" (1856-58), \"Eddische Studien\" (1856), \"Rose und Nachtigall\"\r\n(1860), \"Weihnachten, Ursprünge, Bräuche und Aberglauben\" (1862), \"Die\r\nSchwalbe\" (1869), \"Drachenkämpfe\" (1869), \"Vom Wege nach Damascus\"\r\n(1872), \"Name und Beruf\" (1874), \"Löwenkämpfe von Nemea bis Golgotha\"\r\n(1875), \"Das Buch Esther\" (1878), translated by the Rev. A. Bernstein\r\ninto English and published by T. and T. Clark of Edinburgh (1888), \"Vom\r\nNil zum Ganges\" (1879), \"Christliche Sittenlehre\" (1880), \"Aus literatur\r\nund Symbolik\" (1884), \"Sabbatarche Errinerungen,\" \"Die Hochzeit von\r\nCana\" (1884), \"Aus Literatur und Geschichte\" (1885), \"Aus dem Lande des\r\nSonnenaufgangs\" (1885), \"Kritische Sendschreiben über die Probebibel\"\r\n(1885), \"Wie ich über Judenmission denke\" (1886), \"Das 900 jährige\r\nJubiläum der russischen Kirche\" (1888), \"Aletheia, Vorträge\" (1890),\r\n\"Das 1000 jährige Reich\" (1890). For Lange's Bible-Commentary he wrote\r\nthe expositions on the books of Judges and Ruth. His works against\r\nanti-Semitism were \"Wider Heinrich von Treitschke für die Juden\" (1880),\r\n\"Die Antisemiten und die Evangelische Kirche\" (1881), \"Ahasverus\"\r\n(1885), and \"Der Judengott und Richard Wagner.\" Dr. Cassel composed many\r\npoems under the title, \"Hallelujah,\" containing 188 hymns, and also some\r\ndramas (Vom Könige, Das neue Schauspiel, Der Weiner Congress, Paulus at\r\nDamascus, Paulus at Cyprus, &c.)\r\n\r\nFrom 1875-91 Dr. Cassel edited and published a weekly paper, \"For\r\nChristian life and knowledge,\" entitled \"Sunem.\"\r\n\r\nSuch, in conclusion, was this truly wonderful son of Israel, and\r\nfollower of Christ. His gigantic intellect, marvellous ability,\r\npersuasive oratory, brilliant pen, were alike consecrated to the service\r\nof his Lord and Master, and to the spiritual welfare of his brethren.\r\nSage, philosopher, scholar, author, preacher and missionary, he was a\r\nking amongst his fellow-men. His name will live immortal in the annals\r\nof Jewish and Jewish missionary literature.\r\n\r\nCERF, Karl Friedrich, born in 1782, died 1845, embraced Christianity.\r\nFriedrich Wilhelm IV. conferred upon him the title of Royal\r\nCommissionsrath for services rendered.\r\n\r\nCERF, Friedrich Rudolf, with his wife, Angelica Henrietta, _née_ Israel,\r\nbelonging to Mendelssohn's circle, were baptized at Schöneback in 1818,\r\nand their daughter in 1822.\r\n\r\nCHERSKIER, a convert in Warsaw, translated the Book of Common Prayer\r\ninto Hebrew in 1836, since when 26,000 copies have been issued by the\r\nL.J.S.\r\n\r\nCHERSKI, Reuben, a native of Thorn, was brought up in Leipzig. When\r\nquite a youth he entered a Christian Church, for which offence he was\r\nlocked up by his father in a cupboard. Sometime after he heard\r\nBiesenthal and Poper speak to the Jews about Christ at the Leipzig book\r\nfair. Then he found a New Testament among his father's books, and read\r\nSt. John iii., and was punished by him for doing so, forbidding him to\r\nread it again. After this he received another New Testament from a\r\ncolporteur of the British and Foreign Bible Society, and read it with a\r\npricked conscience for disobeying his father. Then, after he and his\r\nfather were saved by Christians from a fire at Eisenach, he, being now\r\nseventeen years of age, left for Frankfort to seek a livelihood there.\r\nThrough a paternal friend he got employment in the office of the \"Freund\r\nZeitung.\" The chief editor, Israel Harsch, one day in a walk pointed out\r\nto him a man in clerical costume, wearing gold spectacles, with a\r\ncountenance of great gentleness, by saying, \"He is a Meshummad, a\r\nmissionary to the Jews.\" Cherski now recollected that he had seen him\r\nonce at Leipzig, and was warned to keep aloof from him. However, from\r\nthat time he began to attend Dr. Poper's meetings, at one of which he\r\nmet Dr. Biesenthal too, listened to their lectures, and left for Paris\r\napparently unimpressed. Then he met Poper again, received from him the\r\ntract \"Messiah, the Son of David, is also the Son of God,\" became a\r\nchanged man, wrote to his father a confession of his faith in Christ,\r\nreturned to Frankfort, where he found that his fiancée, Lydia, had in\r\nthe meanwhile also been converted.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN, Gustav Christopher, baptized at Nüremberg 1719, and died\r\nthere about 1735. He was the author of two Judæo-German works--\"Yesod\r\nEmunath Yeshua\" (The basis of the Faith of Jesus), Berlin, 1712; and\r\n\"Die Bekehrung's Israel,\" Schwabach, 1722.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANI, Friedrich Albrecht, was born in the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century, died at Prostnitz at the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century. He was baptized in 1674 at Strassburg, having\r\nformerly been the Chazzan (Precentor) at Bruchsal. After having occupied\r\nfor twenty years the chair of Semitics at the university of Leipzig, he\r\nretired to Prostnitz. Christiani's works comprise the following, all\r\npublished at Leipzig. (1) \"Zebah Pesah\" (The sacrifice of Easter), an\r\naccount of the Jewish celebration of Easter in the time of Jesus, and at\r\nthe present. (2) \"Seudath Purim\" (The meal of Purim), 1677, a\r\ndescription of Jewish fasting and feasting. (3) \"Zahakan Melumad\r\nUmethareth\" (The Scholarly Gambler repenting) 1683, a German translation\r\nof the work of Leon of Modena on gambling. (4) \"Abravanel's Commentary\r\non the first prophets, with a Latin index,\" 1686. (5) \"The text of Jonah\r\nwith the Targum Massorah and the commentaries of Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Kimchi\r\nand Abravanel, and a Hebrew Latin Vocabulary,\" 1683. (6) \"Iggereth\"\r\n(Letter) 1676, The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews, translated from\r\nthe Greek into Hebrew. (7) \"Traktat von dem Glauben und Unglauben der\r\nJuden,\" 1713.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANI, Moritz Wilhelm, born at Altorf at the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, died at Prague, 1740, probably a member of the Keyser family of\r\nSchleusingen, Bavaria. He claimed to have been a rabbi at Schleusingen\r\nbefore his baptism in 1715. Christiani wrote: (1) \"Kurze Beschreibung\r\neiner Jüdischen Synagogue und eine Beschreibung der Synagogalen\r\nGebraüche,\" Regensburg, 1723. (2) \"Die Schlacht und Visiterkunst, _ib._,\r\n1724.\" (3) \"Ausgang von dem verstockten Judenthum und Eingang zum wahren\r\nChristenthum,\" an account of his conversion, his profession of faith,\r\nand several orations, Erfurt, 1720. (4) \"Rede zur Einladung für\r\nRabbinische Studien,\" written in Hebrew and German, inserted in \"Johann\r\nDavid Köhler's Program,\" Altorf, 1785. (5) \"A German translation of the\r\nSefer ha Minhagim of Jacob Levi (Matta Ril),\" published at Bremen, 1733.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN, Friedrich Ernest (as a Jewish teacher called Abraham Saul),\r\nwas baptized with his wife and two grown-up sons by Pastor Stemnitz in\r\n1772.\r\n\r\nCHRISTMANN was baptized in 1775.\r\n\r\nCHRISTLIEB, Wilhelm, declared that it was a sermon which he heard\r\npreached to the Jews by Pastor Dekan Soldanus in the town hall of Cassel\r\nwhich convinced him of the truth of the Gospel. He was baptized in 1785.\r\n\r\nCHRISTLIEB, Friedrich Wilhelm, another convert, made himself\r\nparticularly obnoxious to the Jews by attacking the Talmud in a bitter\r\nspirit. He wrote: \"Greuel der Verwüstung des heiligen Jerusalem durch\r\nden jüdischen Talmud,\" Cassel, 1681. \"Lästerungen der Juden gegen\r\nChristum,\" _ib._, 1682. A theological treatise: \"Jesus Christ und Sohn\r\nGottes nach Kabbalistischer Art erwiesen,\" Rinteln, 1697.\r\n\r\nCHRISTHOLD, Christian Albert, born in 1687, was baptized when young with\r\nhis mother. He had great talents, so that at the age of 23, in 1700, he\r\nwas appointed Rector of the Gymnasium in Oettingen, when he wrote a\r\nLatin treatise advocating toleration and liberty to the Jews. He was\r\nafterwards a faithful minister of the Gospel till his death in 1772.\r\nSchulze said of him, \"I have hitherto not found anyone like him.\"\r\n\r\nCHRISTHOLD, Christiane Sophie Magdalene (Judith), a relative of the\r\nabove, followed his example.\r\n\r\nCHRISTFELS, Philipp Ernst (Mordecai), born at Neuhaus, 1671, son of\r\nMoses Shemaja, received a good rabbinic and German education. Being of a\r\ndisputatious disposition, he very often in his wanderings disputed with\r\nChristians on religious subjects, amongst whom was the well-known\r\nWagenseil. A learned rabbi, by the name of Hirsch Froman, once advised\r\nhim to read the New Testament. Another Rabbi, Abraham Reviga, Kabbalist,\r\nwith whom he studied, intimated to him that under the attribute called\r\nBinah is to be understood the Son of God. This made him restless, but at\r\nthe same time enquiring. He was finally, after nine months' instruction,\r\nbaptized in 1701. Christfels was the author, before his baptism, of a\r\nbook in Hebrew, entitled \"Rephuah Hanephesh,\" \"Soul-Medicine,\" and after\r\nhe became a Christian, the Pentateuch with the Targum's and Rashi's\r\ncommentaries were printed under his supervision.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN, Gottlob Meyer (Abraham Meyer), baptized by Schulze (the\r\ncelebrated missionary of Callenberg Inst.), in 1769. He afterwards\r\nstudied Theology.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANUS, Paulus, embraced Christianity about the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century, together with his son. The latter suffered martyrdom\r\n(de le Roi, i. 131).\r\n\r\nCHRISTLIEB, Johann Ludwig Karl Friedrich (Aaron Mendel), was baptized by\r\nthe Court preacher Kern, in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nCOHEN, Dr. Medicinalrath, a convert, at Posen, between 1830-40, took a\r\nlively interest in the evangelization of his brethren, and encouraged\r\nthe missionaries Händler and Bellson in their labours.\r\n\r\nCOHEN, Esther, baptized at Constantinople in 1873, was a deaconess at\r\nMildmay, and was sent in 1885 to Jaffa as a missionary.\r\n\r\nCOHEN, Rev. James, was all his life an ardent supporter of missions to\r\nthe Jews, and for many years a member of the L.J.S. Committee. As far\r\nback as 1849 he delivered an address to the students in the Hebrew\r\nCollege. He was for many years Rector of Whitechapel, where he\r\neloquently preached both by word and pen. Later he was Vicar of Heston.\r\n\r\nCOHEN, Joseph Philipp, born in Prussia, was converted at Swansea, a\r\nnarrative of which he gave in a little tract, entitled \"The Sweetness of\r\nChristianity,\" London, 1845. It was chiefly owing to his being of a\r\nserious turn of mind that he felt the need of redemption from his sins,\r\nand that made him study diligently the Old Testament. Afterward a lady\r\ngave him a New Testament, and the first passage that met his eye was,\r\n\"Come unto Me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give\r\nyou rest.\" He was later a missionary of the British Society until 1873.\r\nAfter that time he continued his calling independently.\r\n\r\nCOHEN, J. John Baptist, after much suffering on account of his\r\nconversion to Christianity, was employed by Lewis Way as an evangelist\r\nin Smyrna, and remained there when Lewis Way left the station in 1837.\r\n\r\nCORAL, J. N., a native of Rhodes, embraced Christianity in Jerusalem\r\nsome time between 1860 and 1870. He was a very earnest and loving man,\r\nan acceptable preacher of the Gospel in Judæo-Spanish and in Hebrew to\r\nhis Sephardic brethren. He did excellent work when he used to visit with\r\nthe writer the towns of Palestine in 1871-2.\r\n\r\nCORESH, Daniel, a convert, mentioned in Wolff, Bibliotheca Hebraica 3.\r\nN, published at Amsterdam a Latin treatise in 1727, under the title\r\n\"Quinque aperti flores collecti ex horto malogranatorum et in fascicula\r\ndigesti.\" He states there that he had then lived in Amsterdam as a\r\nChristian for fifteen years, so that he must have been baptized in 1712.\r\n\r\nDA COSTA, Isaac. Much has been written about this great son of Abraham,\r\nand the following is a short account of his conversion from his own\r\npen:--\r\n\r\n\"You request of me, dear brother, some account of my conversion to the\r\nChristian religion, and to the faith in Jesus Christ; and I cannot\r\nrefuse to tell the things which the God of our fathers has wrought in my\r\nsoul. I will cheerfully join my testimony with that of my brethren, both\r\nby nature and in grace, who endeavour to instruct others and to teach\r\ntheir hearts by retracing the ways of God towards them in His providence\r\nand His grace.\r\n\r\n\"To set His dispensations towards me in a clearer light, I must refer to\r\nmany long past events. A son of Israel is constantly reminded that his\r\npersonal history is closely linked with that of his fathers. I must then\r\ncrave indulgence for prefacing my account with some particulars\r\nrespecting my parentage, which I derive from one of the Jewish families\r\nthat have for several ages dwelt in the Spanish peninsula. Some of my\r\nancestors in that country professed Catholicism, first by compulsion;\r\nand afterwards (a case by no means uncommon in the history of our people\r\nin Spain and Portugal) from conviction, or, at least, in sincerity.\r\nHumanly speaking, we might still have inhabited that country, and\r\nprofessed the Romish faith; but one of the members of our family, Canon\r\nTresonis, of the collegiate church of Oporto, gave up, in consequence of\r\nhis doubts on religion, his office and his country to return to the\r\nSynagogue of his ancestors.\r\n\r\n\"We learn from various biographical works[11] the history of Gabriel\r\n(_Judaic_ Uriel) da Costa (Latin,'a Costa') who with his younger\r\nbrothers, was circumcised at Amsterdam, where, after falling into\r\ncomplete infidelity, he ended his life very unhappily. It is from one of\r\nthese younger brothers, Joseph da Costa, that I take my descent, by the\r\ndirect male line. My family belonged, during two centuries, to the\r\nSpanish and Portuguese synagogue in Amsterdam, where it enjoyed all the\r\nprivileges which Holland then presented to my nation in its exile and\r\ntribulation. My father, who shared in the sentiment of devotedness to\r\nthe house of Orange, so common amongst the Jews, and who was therefore\r\nvery inimical to the revolution, educated me in the same principles. He\r\nwas a very upright man, and gifted with a large share of good sense; and\r\nmy education was to him an object of the most affectionate care and\r\nsolicitude. His religious principles were by no means those of a strict\r\nJew, although he maintained a decorous respect for the outward\r\nordinances of religion. My mother was much more inclined to the\r\nreligious observances of modern Judaism.\r\n\r\n\r\n[11] \"Exemplar Vitæ Humanæ,\" printed at the end of the \"Colloquy of\r\nLimborch with Prabio\"; Bayle, \"Dict. Historique,\" art. A. Costa; Wolff,\r\n\"Bib. Rabbin,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"From childhood my mind had been partially influenced by a sort of\r\nreligious instinct, a vague desire to know and to serve God, whilst I\r\nwas, at the same time, involved in doubt and uncertainty, both as to\r\nRevelation itself, and with regard to the ordinances, and the oral\r\ntraditions of the rabbis. At times I strenuously addicted myself to the\r\ndevotional use of the prayers, the rites and commandments of my\r\nreligion; at others, I relapsed into doubt, and gave way to a distaste\r\nfor all these outward observances. The scoffing and irreligious\r\nphilosophy of the eighteenth century inspired me with horror; and my\r\nattention was earnestly directed to the acquiring of an intelligent\r\nconviction respecting the existence and government of God, and the\r\nimmortality of the soul. But the books I consulted in my search into\r\nthese high interests failed to afford me satisfaction. Their arguments\r\nwere not of sufficient weight fully to convince me of their truth, nor\r\ndid their reasonings fix me in complete incredulity. Materialism\r\nalarmed, distressed, and shocked me. But the subtleties of Plato, of\r\nMendelssohn, and others, could not reach my heart, nor warm it. My mind\r\nwas at that time far from being convinced of the historical fact of\r\nRevelation, or of the veracity of the Old Testament, of Moses, and the\r\nProphets. And although in the midst of this uncertainty, I still clung\r\nto the great recollections of my nation from a feeling of natural pride,\r\nmy commerce with unbelievers, and my study of philosophers, had wrought\r\nin my mind so far as to exclude the idea of an immediate and positive\r\nrevelation. I had formed a sort of deistical system, in which were\r\nmingled rabbinical and Mosaic principles. I looked upon Jesus Christ as\r\na light proceeding from Israel for the illumination of the Gentiles:\r\nmeanwhile the vanities of the world and sin ruled in my daily life. Such\r\nwas the state of my mind when in the providence of God two events\r\noccurred which had a marked influence on my future course.\r\n\r\n\"My father, perceiving my inclination for study, destined me to the\r\ncareer of jurisprudence, a pursuit which, though formerly closed to the\r\nJews, had been partially opened to them since the revolution of 1795.\r\nFrom the age of thirteen to fifteen years (1811-1813), having attended\r\nregularly the Latin classes in my native city of Amsterdam, I began a\r\ncourse of lessons with the Professor of Antiquities and Literature, a\r\nman of learning, and possessed of a highly refined taste. His historical\r\nlectures gave him ample opportunity for asserting and setting in a\r\nconspicuous light the truth and high authority of the writings of Moses,\r\nand he earnestly vindicated those records from the sophisms and\r\nfallacies of Voltaire, and the other sceptics of the age. The idea of a\r\n_positive revelation_ was now awakened in my mind; I began to believe in\r\nthe divinity of the Old Testament, and this great truth gradually\r\ndeveloped, was to me as a beacon amidst doubt and obscurity. Revealed\r\nreligion, the divine authority of the Bible, is an historical fact.\r\n\r\n\"My study of the Bible history was soon followed by enquiries which\r\noriginated partly, I must own, from national pride. In the midst of the\r\ncontempt and dislike of the world for the name of Jew, I had ever\r\ngloried in it. I began, therefore, to study the history of our families,\r\nand of our nation, in Spain and Portugal, in respect to its\r\ntheology--its poetry--its attainments in science--its political and\r\ndiplomatic position, taking a general review of its prosperity and of\r\nits astonishing calamities. Throughout their history, both ancient and\r\nmodern, I perceived something so extraordinary as to be quite\r\ninexplicable, unless we view the Jews as the subjects of remarkable\r\nprivileges, and of as remarkable a downfall; of a special election of\r\nGod, and of an enormous crime on the part of the elect people. It was\r\nthus that the consideration of Judaism prepared me for the knowledge of\r\nthat religion, which alone is the solution and the fulfilment of the\r\npure and divine Judaism of the Old Testament.\r\n\r\n\"Another circumstance in my life tended to my further enlightenment. The\r\nperusal of the ancient classics, the political events of 1813 and 1815,\r\neven the study of the history of my fathers according to the flesh,\r\nawakened in my soul the faculties of poetry. As a youthful poet, I was\r\npresented by a learned Hebraist of our nation to the greatest of our\r\nDutch contemporary poets, the celebrated Bilderdyk, who died at the age\r\nof 75 years in 1831. He was a remarkable man in all respects, and one\r\nwhose political and religious convictions, and originality of mind and\r\ncharacter, had armed all this present age, at least in his own country,\r\nagainst him. Misunderstood, persecuted, banished in 1795, and harassed\r\nby all sorts of misfortunes, he had found from his youth, strength and\r\nconsolation in the Gospel of Christ. Attached in heart to the truths of\r\nthe confession of the Reformed Churches, he had besides early perceived\r\nthe glorious future, announced by the prophets to the ancient people of\r\nGod, and how their conversion to the Messiah, crucified by them, would\r\nbe one day to the nations at large like life from the dead. From thence\r\narose a particular attachment to Israel for their fathers' sake, and for\r\nthe love of Christ, who sprung from Israel according to the flesh. Very\r\nnaturally, I felt strongly drawn towards this extraordinary man, I\r\nbecame his disciple, and also his intimate friend for eighteen years to\r\nthe day of his death. It is to him, under the hand of God, and through\r\nHis adorable grace, that I saw the light which led me to the Christian\r\nreligion, and to the faith in Jesus, my Saviour, and my God. Not that\r\nBilderdyk ever sought to make a proselyte of his young disciple. With a\r\nwisdom which I can attribute to nothing but the direction of the\r\nAlmighty, he rather endeavoured not to sway my mind by the influence\r\nwhich his superior intelligence gave him over me. He only endeavoured to\r\nrender me more of an Israelite than is consistent with the wisdom of the\r\npresent age. He spoke to me of the Old Testament; he directed my\r\nattention to the prophecies, to the promises given to the fathers, to\r\nthe portions of revealed truth, preserved even in the traditions of the\r\nRabbis (Messiah ben David and Messiah ben Joseph, &c.) Especially he\r\ntried to make me feel that the true Christian shares in the hopes of\r\nIsrael in regard to a glorious reign of Messiah upon the throne of\r\nDavid; and that on the other hand (it is thus that he expressed himself\r\nin a piece of poetry which he addressed to me in 1819), the sincere Jew\r\nis a Christian in hope.\r\n\r\n\"Soon the hand of God led us further on. It was in 1820. Bilderdyk and I\r\nwere engaged in a deeply serious conversation on the things of God and\r\nof truth. In the ardour of discourse he happened to say to me, that the\r\nancient Jews themselves had acknowledged a plurality of persons in the\r\nineffable unity of God. That God seeing Himself, contemplating Himself,\r\nreflecting Himself, begot His Son from all eternity; and that the Son is\r\nHe whom Christians adore in the person of Jesus Christ crucified.\r\n\r\n\"Then did my eyes perceive the first rays of new light. I began to read\r\nthe New Testament; I read that unspeakably sublime and blessed word (St.\r\nJohn i. 6-14), 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with\r\nGod, and the Word was God, and the Word was made flesh.' I began to feel\r\nan abhorrence of sin, for which the Saviour Himself manifested in the\r\nflesh, had suffered the death of the cross. I perceived the fulfilment\r\nof the prophecies of Isaiah, xi., liii., lxi., and in Psalms xxii., cx.,\r\n&c. I adored--I believed, and by degrees this faith operated upon my\r\nconscience and my practice. Religion was no longer merely a sublime\r\nspeculation, or a great national interest; I found that I must become\r\nthe property of Jesus Christ, that I must live to Him, and by Him.\r\nTwenty years have elapsed since that period. Shame in the sight of God\r\nand before men befits me in recording so holy an obligation. But He who\r\ncalled me from the midst of darkness is faithful. He will not suffer me\r\nto quit this life without having truly glorified Him with my lips, and\r\nin my life, by the faith which alone saves. During the early days of my\r\nconvictions I had, though with some hesitation, opened my mind on the\r\nsubject, to my friend Capadose. We soon entered into a full discussion\r\nof it--and our conversations were more and more directed to the great\r\nquestions of the truth and salvation; we read and examined together. A\r\nthird enquirer into the Scriptures and the truth in Christ, was soon\r\nafter joined with us. God gave me, in 1821, a wife whose choice from the\r\nfirst communication we had together on this all-important subject, was\r\nin accord with my own. By a remarkable providence of God, Hannah\r\nBelmonte, my cousin, betrothed to me in 1820, had been, through a train\r\nof family circumstances, brought up in a school of Christian young\r\nladies. Having been admitted to share their religious instructions, she\r\nbecame acquainted with the catechism of Heidelberg, and had heard the\r\nblessed name of Jesus before I did. From the time I imparted to her what\r\nwas passing in my own mind, she became to me a beloved sister in Christ,\r\nas well as a faithful companion in the trials of life, and in the search\r\nafter eternal life through faith in our great God and Saviour. Together\r\nwith our friend Capadose, we were baptized the 20th October, 1822, at\r\nLeyden; and the Lord afterwards added to us three other members of our\r\nfamily. We kept up a good understanding, and uninterrupted communion of\r\nfeeling with my mother-in-law Belmonte, and her eldest daughter, Esther;\r\nthough we were far from anticipating the happy change and renewal of\r\nheart and life, which quickly developed itself. By the Divine blessing,\r\na conversation that my mother-in-law and I had together, one evening,\r\nwas made the means of arousing her to a serious concern for the\r\nsalvation of her soul, and this example was soon followed by her\r\ndaughter. Both displayed great eagerness for Christian instruction, and\r\nshortly after they openly confessed the name of the Lord Jesus, and\r\nwere baptized by the venerable and pious Pierre Chevalier (pastor of the\r\nWalloon church in this town)--who is now with them before the throne of\r\nthe Lamb.\r\n\r\n\"Our mother, then aged sixty-eight years, survived her baptism two\r\nyears, a period which she devoted almost entirely to prayer and studying\r\nthe Scriptures, especially the New Testament, her previous reading\r\nhaving been confined to the most frivolous publications. Perfect peace\r\nwas the portion of her latter days, and her last words were, 'Come, Lord\r\nJesus!' Her daughter Esther, who afterwards married the worthy son of\r\nthe Walloon pastor, our intimate friend and brother, Monsieur J.\r\nChevalier, after a most edifying course of devotedness to her Lord and\r\nSaviour, died in her confinement in June, 1840. Her soul also reposes in\r\npeace in the bosom of Abraham, and in the full fruition of His presence\r\nwho redeemed her with His blood.\r\n\r\n\"Another member of our family, who had become a disciple of Christ, and\r\nhad been baptized some time after us (but quite independently of us),\r\nhad preceded our dear sister in death; delivered from the depths of sin\r\nby the healing grace of the Lord, he had found pardon and eternal life\r\nthrough the new and living way of the blood of Christ. After having\r\nstudied theology, he was about to assume the pastoral charge of one of\r\nour churches, when he was called to his rest.\r\n\r\n\"To God the most holy, be thanksgiving and praise for his unspeakable\r\nmercies in life, in death, and throughout all eternity. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Bilderdyk's death Da Costa was generally recognized as his\r\nsuccessor among the Dutch poets. He wrote fifty-three longer and shorter\r\npoems. Amongst his other works are--\"Israel en de Volken\" (2nd ed.\r\nHaarlem, 1848-49), a survey of the history of the Jews to the nineteenth\r\ncentury, the third volume dealing with the history of the Spanish and\r\nPortuguese Jews. The work was translated into English under the title,\r\n\"Israel and the Gentiles,\" by Mary Kennedy (London, 1850), and into\r\nGerman by a friend of God's Word (Miss Thumb), published by K. Mann,\r\nFrankfurt, A/M. 1855. He also wrote two papers, \"The Jews in Spain and\r\nPortugal, and the Jews from Spain and Portugal,\" in 1836; \"The Von\r\nSchönberg (Belmonte) family,\" in the \"Jahrbuch für Holland,\" 1851; and\r\n\"The noble families among the Jews\" (Navorscher, 1857).\r\n\r\nDAHAN, Job, a Jew in Mogador, baptized by the L.J.S. missionary\r\nGinsburg, about 1872-3, had to experience, like St. Paul, stripes and\r\nimprisonment, yet remained steadfast in the faith and laboured for the\r\nMaster.\r\n\r\nDANIEL, David, laboured as a pioneer missionary at Safed, in 1849,\r\namidst great difficulties and personal dangers. As soon as one enquirer\r\ncame forth to make a public confession of his faith in Christ, Daniel\r\nwas exposed to ill-treatment from his unbelieving brethren, and at last\r\ncompelled to return to Jerusalem. Later he laboured among the Jews in\r\nFrankfort, and the rest of his life he spent as a lay-worker at\r\nWadhurst, in Sussex. He was a true servant of Christ.\r\n\r\nDARMON, Solomon, born in Algiers in 1850, baptized by Ginsburg in 1872,\r\nlaboured with tokens of Divine approval in Mogador. A Jewish widow, who\r\nhad declared that if angels from heaven were to tell her that Jesus is\r\nthe Messiah she would not believe, was convinced at length through the\r\ntestimony of Darmon. His own wife later followed his example.\r\n\r\nDARMSTADT (Rabbi Schittenhoven), was baptized in Switzerland, in 1749,\r\nby Pastor Augusti.\r\n\r\nDARMSTADTER, son of a learned Jew, was baptized in Darmstadt, in 1680.\r\nConcerning him, there appeared in Breslau, in 1713, a little book by\r\nDeakonus Caspar, entitled \"Geschtillte Sehnsucht eines wahren Israeliten\r\nnach dem himmlischen Jerusalem\" (\"The longing of a true Israelite after\r\nthe heavenly Jerusalem satisfied\"). To show the Jews that Christianity\r\nwas a matter of deep concern with him he abstained from food for several\r\ndays, and by his whole life and conversation he exercised a salutary\r\ninfluence upon them.\r\n\r\nDAVID, Andreas Friedrich, born at Altofen, in 1750, was baptized in\r\nVienna about 1785. Superintendent Folk reports of him in that year that\r\nhe was a sincere man and the first Jewish convert received into the\r\nEvangelical Church in Austria (\"Kalkar Israel,\" 203).\r\n\r\nDAVID, Fanta, a Falasha convert in Abyssinia. Concerning him, Argawi\r\nwrote on March 14, 1889, that he had accompanied him on a long journey\r\non foot to Monkullo, in order to be able to send a letter from there to\r\ntheir friend, Mr. Flad, in Germany.\r\n\r\nDAVID, Ferdinand, born in Hamburg, in 1810, was baptized in Berlin by\r\nPastor Schultze, in 1828. As a musician and composer he associated with\r\nMendelssohn. He died at Klosters, in Granbündten. His sister Louise,\r\nborn in 1811, also embraced Christianity and died in London as Madam\r\nDulken, in 1850.\r\n\r\nDAVID, Georg Nathan, son of a Jewish merchant, was born at Copenhagen in\r\n1793, and after receiving a good education, embraced Christianity. He\r\nbecame Professor at the University of Copenhagen, founded the newspaper\r\n\"Fäderlandet,\" which advocated the political rights of the people. He\r\nwas also director of a bank. He died in 1874.\r\n\r\nDAVID, Hakim, physician and learned Talmudist, was baptized by the\r\nL.J.S. missionaries at Bagdad, in 1850.\r\n\r\nDAVID, J., laboured as an evangelist among the Jews in Hamburg and\r\nHolstein about 1875.\r\n\r\nDAVIDSON, Benjamin, a native of Posen, embraced Christianity in London,\r\nprobably under the ministry of Ridley Herschell, who had known him at\r\nhome. In 1843 they both belonged to a Hebrew Christian Prayer Union,\r\nwhich used to meet once a month for prayer. In 1847 Davidson was\r\nappointed Principal of the Missionary Training College of the British\r\nSociety for the Propagation of the Gospel among the Jews. He also used\r\nto instruct enquirers. He was the author of an \"Analytical Hebrew and\r\nChaldee Lexicon,\" \"Syriac Reading Lessons with Analysis,\" and \"Chaldee\r\nReading Lessons,\" an English edition of Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar. He\r\nassisted in the editing of the \"Englishman's Hebrew Concordance.\" His\r\nchief literary work, however, was posthumous--a Concordance of the\r\nHebrew and Chaldee Scriptures. Davidson was also actively engaged from\r\ntime to time in missionary work. In 1866 he laboured in Vienna and had\r\nmuch intercourse with students. In Bordeaux he stirred up an interest in\r\nthe Jews among evangelical Christians, so that they founded the \"Societé\r\nd'amis d'Israel.\" In 1871 he became Superintendent of the Home for Aged\r\nConverts and for Orphans, where he died the same year.\r\n\r\nDAVIS, Joseph, a native of Poland, was baptized in 1819, in Edinburgh,\r\nand was probably the first convert of the Edinburgh Jewish Missionary\r\nSociety, which was founded the year before. He afterwards laboured as a\r\nmissionary among his brethren.\r\n\r\nDAVIS, Rev. Nathan, was one of the first missionaries of the Free Church\r\nof Scotland. He was sent to Tunis in 1830, where he raised a spirit of\r\nenquiry amongst the Jews, and baptized some of them. In 1848 he was\r\ntransferred to Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nDENNIS, Rev. Dr. M. J., worked first as a missionary in Palestine. Later\r\non he left the Holy Land and joined Mr. Freshman's mission in New York,\r\nbut his station was at Boston.\r\n\r\nDESAIR, Ludwig (Leopold Dessauer), born in Posen in 1809, embraced\r\nChristianity. He is known as one of the greatest Shakespearian actors of\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nDETMOND, Johann Hermann, son of the Court physician at Hanover, born in\r\n1787. The whole family embraced Christianity, and Detmond, junior,\r\nbecame a member of the German Parliament in 1848. (\"Jewish\r\nIntelligence,\" 1856, p. 329).\r\n\r\nDEUTSCH, Christian Solomon, born at Temesvar, in Hungary, 1734. Up to\r\nhis twentieth year he studied scarcely anything but the Talmud at home\r\nand in Prague. The Bible was a sealed book to him. He had married, as\r\nthe custom was then, very young, and had his board and lodging with his\r\nfather-in-law, so that he could apply all his energies to Talmudic\r\nstudy, till he should be a light in Israel. In 1760 his wife died, and\r\nafter four months he married the second daughter, and was kept again. In\r\nthe same year he received from the Grand Rabbi of Moravia, the title of\r\nMoreinu or D.D. However, he was not happy; he had read a passage in the\r\nTalmud, tract Megillah 24 b, which troubled him. It is thus: \"R. Jose\r\nsaid: I was vexed all my life in not being able to understand the\r\nprophecy in Deut. xxviii. 29. 'Thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind\r\ngropeth in darkness,' until one dark night I met a blind man carrying a\r\nburning torch, and asked him, 'What good is that torch to you?' He\r\nreplied, 'Although I cannot myself see, yet others can see and take care\r\nof me that I fall not into a pit or among thorns and briars.\" This\r\nawakened serious thoughts in Solomon's mind. He felt that he was not\r\neven like the blind man, for he had neglected the Word of God in the Old\r\nTestament, and as for the New, he, living in a Roman Catholic country,\r\nhad never heard of it. So he began to practise penitence by wearing a\r\ngarment of horsehair over his body, fasting and castigations. At night\r\nhe often used to weep over his sins, and his wife could not console him.\r\nThen she reproached him that he had some secret which he kept from her.\r\nTo this he replied, \"I will confess the truth to you; we must choose\r\nanother way and get out of the darkness in which we are living, if we\r\nwish to escape from hell.\" He had been already meditating about\r\nembracing Christianity, and this he betrayed somewhat by his behaviour,\r\nand the result was that he was compelled by the rabbi to divorce his\r\nwife. When three Roman priests heard of this affair, they visited him,\r\nand one of them assured him that he had prayed to the Virgin for his\r\nconversion, therefore he ought at once to join the Church. But Solomon\r\nrefused, and left his home in 1762, praying on the way for guidance in\r\nthe name of Jesus. This prayer he records in full in his autobiography.\r\nHe came to Prague and then to Saxony, studying the Scriptures on the\r\nway. Here in \"a prominent town\" (probably Dresden) he visited the rabbi,\r\nand they enjoyed themselves in a discussion over some knotty Talmudic\r\nsubtleties. On October 24, he read for the first time Isa. liii. and\r\nasked the rabbi concerning whom the prophet spoke. Then the rabbi\r\nappointed an hour and a private place where he would speak to him about\r\nthis chapter. When they met together he was astonished to hear the rabbi\r\nrevealing as a secret his belief that the chapter was fulfilled in Jesus\r\nof Nazareth. Thence Solomon went to Leipzig, Berlin, Amsterdam, and at\r\nlast to London, where he was very ill. After his recovery in 1763, he\r\nreturned to Holland. On his way by ship to Arnheim, he met a Swiss\r\nChristian, who took a great fancy to him, and in a conversation\r\nexpressed a wish that the Lord might enlighten his eyes as he did Rabbi\r\nJechiel Hirschlein who had been baptized at Zurich. In short, after much\r\ninstruction, Solomon was baptized at Amsterdam, on June 25, 1767, after\r\nhanding in a written confession of his faith under the title, \"Jehovah\r\nGlorified through the acknowledgment of the true Messiah Jesus Christ,\r\nproved from the writings of the Prophets, Evangelists, and Apostles,\"\r\nconsisting of 175 pages, and printed at Amsterdam. He then studied\r\ntheology and became Pastor at Mydret in 1777, where he laboured\r\nfaithfully till his death in 1797. His chief literary work was,\r\n\"Israel's Verlosinge en eeuwige Behoudenis\" (Israel's redemption and\r\neternal salvation), 3 vols., Amsterdam, 1769-93.\r\n\r\nDEUTSCH, Ignaz Friedrich Gottlieb, a native of Perskretscham, and\r\nevidently a relative of the next, was baptized in Berlin in 1825.\r\n\r\nDEUTSCH, Siegmund Herman, was a remarkable personality. He was born in\r\nPerskretscham, Silesia, in 1791. As usual he had an early Talmudical\r\neducation. Then he went to the Gymnasium, and then to the University of\r\nBreslau, where he studied mathematics and astronomy. In 1815 he served\r\nas a soldier in the Prussian army, took part in the war, and was\r\npromoted to be an officer and teacher in the military school in 1817.\r\nThen he had a duel with some one and was imprisoned in a fort. There he\r\nwas converted to Christianity, and afterwards served as an artillery\r\nofficer in the Greek liberation war.\r\n\r\nReturning to Berlin in 1824, where he attended the ministry of the\r\ncelebrated Gossner, he associated with the convert Lachs, who was a\r\nteacher in a school for deaf and dumb, sat under the theological\r\nteachings of Neander, and was thus spiritually prepared for being called\r\nto labour for the Master among his own people. This call came from Dr.\r\nMcCaul, and after a little more preparation in the Hebrew College in\r\nPalestine Place, he was sent by the L.J.S. as a missionary to Warsaw in\r\n1828, where he laboured (with a short interval at Breslau) till 1833. He\r\nthen was stationed in Bavaria. He died in 1864, leaving a MS. (not yet\r\nprinted) on the future of Israel.\r\n\r\nDISRAELI, Benjamin, Earl of Beaconsfield, born in London, December 21,\r\n1804, died there April 19, 1881. Of this preeminently distinguished man\r\nin the nineteenth century there are many biographies and lasting\r\nmonuments. We need only record very briefly here that he was one of\r\nEngland's greatest sons and statesmen, and the greatest ornament of the\r\nJewish people in modern times. An ardent lover of his nation, a genuine\r\nEnglish patriot, a friend of his great Queen, a thorough Protestant\r\nChurchman, yet with liberal tendencies, and a true believer in\r\nChristianity, which he regarded as completed Judaism. His works are\r\nthese: \"Vivian Grey,\" 1817; \"The Infernal Marriage;\" \"Ixion in Heaven,\"\r\nand \"Popanilla,\" 1828; \"Contarini Fleming,\" and \"The Wondrous Tale of\r\nAlroy,\" 1832; \"The Young Duke,\" about that time; \"What is he?\" 1833;\r\n\"Revolutionary Epic,\" 1834; \"Coningsby,\" 1844; \"Tancred,\" 1847; \"Sybil,\"\r\n1845; \"The rise of Iskander,\" \"Vindication of the British\r\nConstitution,\" \"Venetia,\" \"Henrietta Temple,\" \"The Tragedy of Count\r\nAlarcos,\" and \"Lothair,\" were all productions of his great intellect at\r\ndifferent seasons. Benjamin's mother, his sister Sarah, born 1802, his\r\nbrother Ralph, 1809, and his brother James, 1813, were all Hebrew\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\nDISRAELI, Isaac, left the synagogue in 1817. Though we have no definite\r\ninformation about his baptism, we may reasonably assume that he was a\r\nmember of the Church of England. This appears from his having his\r\nchildren baptized, from his pamphlet, \"The Spirit of Judaism,\" in which\r\nhe vindicated himself for the step he had taken, from his articles on\r\n\"The Talmud,\" \"Psalm Singing,\" the Pearl Bibles and six thousand errata\r\nin his \"Curiosities of literature,\" &c., all shewing that he was an\r\nearnest student of religious subjects and of the Scriptures, and that he\r\nendeavoured to spread the light of truth.\r\n\r\nDUCAT, H., a native of Warsaw, embraced Christianity, together with his\r\nwife, about the middle of the nineteenth century. He was a saintly\r\nChristian man, laboured as missionary for some time under the British\r\nSociety, was one of the founders of the Hebrew Christian Prayer Union\r\nand of a Loan Fund for needy converts. His sons-in-law are the Rev. Dr.\r\nFlecker and the Rev. John Schor.\r\n\r\nDUSHAW, Amos I., spent the greater part of his youth in Jerusalem,\r\nPalestine, where he attended the school of the London Jews' Society.\r\nHere the seeds of Christian truth were sown in his young heart. He\r\nafterwards came to London, where he was brought into close connexion\r\nwith the members of the above-mentioned society, and the germs of truth\r\ngradually grew, budded, and blossomed into faith in our Lord as his\r\nMessiah.\r\n\r\nDushaw went to America in 1895. The following year he was baptized, upon\r\nconfession of his faith in Christ, in the Fourth Congregational Church,\r\nat Hartford, Conn.\r\n\r\nHe followed Horace Greeley's advice, \"Young man, go West.\" He was\r\ndetermined to obtain a classical education. After a hard struggle, that\r\nperseverance and determination to conquer all obstacles always a\r\ncomponent of the Jewish character, enabled him, in 1901, to graduate\r\nfrom Redfield College, South Dakota. He afterwards returned to New York,\r\nand entered the Union Theological Seminary, from which he graduated in\r\n1904. June 12, 1905, he received a preacher's license from the New York\r\nPresbytery.\r\n\r\nWhile pursuing his regular academic course he made a speciality of\r\nsociology, literature and history. Especially was he interested in\r\nHebrew history and the present social, religious and political status of\r\nIsrael. He supplemented this study by personal observation as a worker\r\non the East Side of New York. This training enabled him to write for\r\n\"The People, the Land and the Book\" some very choice articles. Several\r\nsecular papers quoted from one of his articles, \"Moses and Jesus.\"\r\n\r\nThe production of this article was due to the following incident. Dushaw\r\ncalled upon one of the leading reformed rabbis to discuss the general\r\ncondition of the Jews in the Ghetto. This rabbi was so much impressed\r\nwith his insight into the situation, and also with his information on\r\nmany facts pertaining to Israel's development, that he advised him to\r\nreturn to the Hebrew ranks. Israel, he said, would appreciate his\r\nability, whereas the Church would simply cast him out, because he was a\r\nmember of Israel. He thought Dushaw was foolish to waste his time in the\r\nChurch. On separating, the rabbi gave him a lecture, \"Moses and Jesus,\"\r\ndelivered in his temple. Dushaw then decided to write one on the same\r\nsubject, from his own point of view. We quote from it.\r\n\r\n\"If Solon belongs to Athens, Lycurgus to Sparta, Moses belongs to\r\nhumanity. He is the greatest among the great, the deliverer of his\r\npeople, the world's legislator, and the apostle and prophet of\r\nMonotheism....\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder how much Jesus, the brother and pupil of Moses, did to make\r\nMoses as popular as he is to-day? It was Jesus who inspired the men to\r\ntranslate the writings of Moses into so many tongues. Yet this does not\r\nin any way belittle Moses. What if the pupil is greater than the master!\r\nSurely Moses would not envy Jesus if he accomplished more. Moses, the\r\nmost unselfish man that ever lived, would be only too glad to see a\r\nbrother the Saviour of the world. Did he not wish that all Israel were\r\nprophets? What right has the Jew to reject Jesus? Has he not made Israel\r\nthe most known people? What if his followers did persecute Israel?\r\nPersecution is contrary to the spirit of Jesus.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus has proved Himself to be the greater Moses. He has been a light\r\nto the nations, guiding them to Moses, to the prophets, and unto God.\r\nWherever Jesus is proclaimed, there the Monotheism of Moses is\r\nestablished, and the ethic, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,'\r\nis given a wider interpretation.\"\r\n\r\nThe article \"The Ghetto and Its Relation to Jewish Missions.\" The\r\nsubstance of this work was delivered at the \"First International Hebrew\r\nChristian Conference,\" held in Mountain Lake Park, Md., July 28-30,\r\n1903.\r\n\r\nThe article, \"Hebrew Christian Literature,\" was written at the request\r\nof the editor.\r\n\r\nAs he came in contact with both cultured and uncultured Christians, and\r\ndiscovered how little they appreciated the work of Israel, he was led to\r\nwrite the two articles, \"Salvation is of the Jews--Jesus,\" and \"Let\r\nThere Be Peace.\" We quote from the first one:\r\n\r\n\"I am anxiously awaiting the hour when there will be a new nation--'a\r\nnation born in a day'--when the martyr nation, the suffering nation of\r\nIsaiah, will awake from its cruel slumber and perceive that for the last\r\nnineteen hundred years a fountain of life has been flowing for it from\r\nthe heart of one of its own sons--the best son of Israel--Jesus Christ.\r\nWhat a spiritual revolution will then take place in the world! Heaven\r\nand earth shall resound with joy! For Israel, the Prince of God, shall\r\nclothe himself in robes of righteousness and go forth in the might of\r\nJehovah to conquer the earth for the Lord--to set up everywhere the\r\nbanner of social, political and spiritual freedom. Then, and not till\r\nthen--when every one shall serve his brother faithfully; when all\r\nbarriers now separating Jew and Gentile shall be no more; when every man\r\nshall dwell unmolested under his fig-tree; when God shall be worshipped\r\nin the Spirit of Jesus; when the old order of things shall pass away and\r\nthe whole earth shall be known as the temple of God,--then shall\r\nIsrael's mission end. For then there will be no more Jew, but all shall\r\nbe called children of God and brothers of Jesus.\"\r\n\r\nDWORKOWITZ, Rev. Paul, a native of Russia, baptized by the L.J.S.\r\nmissionary Dr. Klee, in Berlin, about 1864 or 1865. He then studied at\r\nBasle, and laboured as a missionary of the British Society, and Pastor\r\nin Warsaw, the Baltic Provinces, Breslau, Munich and Hamburg, with much\r\nblessing upon his labours. He is a gifted man, and above all, an\r\n\"Israelite indeed.\"\r\n\r\nEBERS, George Moritz, born in Berlin, 1837. He became first Professor on\r\nEgyptology in Jena in 1868, and then in Leipzig in 1870. He travelled\r\nfor eighteen months in Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Nubia, Arabia Petrea.\r\nThe result of his Archæological and scientific investigations he\r\npublished in several works--1. \"Eine ägyptische Königstochter\"\r\n(Stuttgart, 1864), which describes Egyptian life at the time of the\r\nPersian conquest. This was translated into English by Gore (London,\r\n1870). 2. \"Disquisitiones de Dynastia xxvi. regum Æg.\" (Berlin, 1855).\r\n3. \"Aegypten und die Bucher Mosis, ein Sachlicher Commentar zu Genesis\r\nund Exodus\" (Leipzig, 1868). 4. \"Durch Gosen zum Sinai aus dem\r\nWanderbuche und der Bibliothek\" (Leipzig, 1872). 5. \"Ueber das alt\r\naegyptische Schrift System\" (1875). 6. \"Papyrus Ebers,\" his chief work,\r\nwhich is in the University of Leipzig. 7. \"Ein hieratisches Handbuch\r\nAltaegyptischer Arznei Kunde,\" 2 vols.

He wrote \"Die\r\nGestirne und die Weltgeschichte, Gedanken und Raum, Zeit und Ewigkeit\"\r\n(Breslau, 1846-47). This work was translated into English. \"Walter\r\nScott,\" 1860, also translated into English. \"A Biography of Byron\"\r\n(Leipzig 1862). \"Geschichte des Preussischen Staates,\" 7 vols. (Breslau,\r\n1866-73).\r\n\r\nEDELSTEIN, Rev. S., after finishing his theological course at Leipzig,\r\nwent to Canada, and was ordained by Bishop Hellmuth in 1880 and\r\nappointed to a church at Eagle, Ontario.\r\n\r\nEDERSHEIM, Rev. Dr. Alfred, born at Vienna, March 7, 1825, died at\r\nMentone, March 16, 1889. We give the following extract about him from\r\nthe Memoir of Dr. Saphir, by Rev. G. Carlyle: \"In 1847 young Edersheim\r\nbecame a student at the University of Buda-Pest. He had been brought up\r\nluxuriously in Vienna, and was one of the leaders of fashion. He was\r\nhighly educated, spoke Latin fluently, knew Greek, German, French,\r\nHebrew, Hungarian and Italian. When Cremieux, the head of the French\r\nbar, paid a visit to Vienna, the synagogue presented him with an\r\naddress, and deputed young Edersheim to deliver it. Cremieux was so\r\npleased with his eloquence that he offered his father to take his son to\r\nParis, and provide for him for life, but his parents would not give him\r\nup.... Before the winter was over, Edersheim was under the teaching of\r\nthe Holy Spirit, and had glorious views of the Deity of Christ. Trusting\r\nin His One Sacrifice, and filled with the peace of God, he gave himself\r\nup to be His servant in any way it might please God to direct him. He\r\nopened a class to teach the students English on the condition that the\r\nBible should be their only lesson book. Baptized, and now full of life\r\nand vigour, it was resolved that he should go to Edinburgh, to the Rev.\r\nProfessor Duncan, to complete his theological studies. Edersheim, after\r\nhis ordination, was missionary first in Jassy, Roumania, and then\r\nminister for many years at the Free College Church, Old Aberdeen, and\r\nthen at Torquay.... He then joined the Church of England and became\r\nVicar of Loders in Dorset.\"\r\n\r\nHe resigned his living in 1883, and settled at Oxford, where he held the\r\nposition of Grinfield Lecturer of the University. He was also Warburton\r\nLecturer of Lincoln's Inn, and \"Select Preacher\" of the University of\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\nDr. Edersheim was a voluminous author, and his works are extremely\r\nvaluable from the fact that he was able to deal with his subject both\r\nfrom the standpoint of a learned Jew and a learned Christian. It may be\r\nas well to state here his total output, from which it will be seen how\r\nwide and extensive was his range of study and scholarship. He was\r\nTranslator and Editor of the \"History of Speculative Philosophy from\r\nKant to Hegel, from the German of Dr. Chalybäus, with introduction by\r\nSir Wm. Hamilton\" (Edinburgh); \"Kurtz, History of the Old Covenant (vol.\r\n1) with condensed abstract of Kurtz's Bible and Astronomy\"; \"Lange,\r\nBible Commentary on St. Matthew\" (2 vols.); \"Kurtz, History of the\r\nChristian Church, with emendations and additions\" (Edinburgh, 1860);\r\nAuthor of \"History of the Jewish Nation from the Destruction of\r\nJerusalem to the Establishment of Christianity in the Roman Empire\" (T.\r\nand T. Clark, 1856. Revised by Rev. H. A. White. Longmans, 1896); \"The\r\nGolden Diary of Heart-Converse with Jesus in the Book of Psalms\"\r\n(R.T.S.); \"Elisha the Prophet, his History and Times\" (R.T.S.); \"The\r\nJubilee Rhythm of St. Bernard,\" and other Hymns, chiefly from the Latin\r\n(J. Nisbet and Co., 1866); \"The Temple, its Ministry and Services as\r\nthey were at the time of Jesus Christ\" (R.T.S., 1874); \"Sketches of\r\nJewish Social Life in the days of Christ\" (London, 1876); \"Bible\r\nHistory,\" 7 vols. (R.T.S.); \"The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah,\" 2\r\nvols. (Longmans, 1884; eighth edition, 1894); \"Jesus the Messiah,\" an\r\nabridged edition of the foregoing; \"Prophecy and History in relation to\r\nthe Messiah, being the Warburton Lectures for 1880-84\" (8 vols.,\r\nLongmans, 1885); \"Commentary on Ecclesiasticus,\" in \"The Speaker's\r\nCommentary on the Apocrypha\" (J. Murray, 1888); \"Tohu-va-Vohu (Without\r\nform and void),\" a collection of Fragmentary Thoughts and Criticisms,\r\nedited by his daughter (Longmans, 1890), and various articles from time\r\nto time in the \"Edinburgh Review.\" He was also editor of \"Israel's\r\nWatchman\" in 1877.\r\n\r\nEDUARD, Julius Anton, born in Lissa (Posen), in 1785. When still a young\r\nboy he felt drawn towards Christianity. In order to prevent this\r\ntendency developing further, his mother and stepfather, then living at\r\nBreslau, sent him away to relatives at Lissa. But in due time he\r\nembraced Christianity, and friends helped him to study theology at\r\nBerlin, and he was ordained in 1816, and laboured for many years as a\r\nfaithful and beloved Pastor at Breslau. His name occurs often in the\r\nreports of the L.J.S. as one who took a great interest in the mission to\r\nthe Jews, and as having also accompanied the missionaries on their\r\njourney to Poland.\r\n\r\nEGSIABHER, Debtera Gebra, a very learned Falasha convert, labouring\r\namong his brethren in Abyssinia in 1874, when Mr. J. M. Flad met some of\r\nthe converts at Kassala.\r\n\r\nEHRLICH, Herman, born at Cracow in 1837, of a family locally designated\r\nas Anshey Emeth (men of truth). He was baptized in London by Dr. Ewald\r\nin 1856. After working as a lay-helper for three years, he was appointed\r\nmissionary by the London City Mission, under whom he has laboured\r\nfaithfully ever since. He was one of the first organisers of Sunday\r\nservices in theatres, and he founded the Hebrew Conference Hall, Old\r\nMontague Street, Whitechapel, where he is [1909] doing evangelistic\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nEISENSTEIN, Ferd. Gotthald Maxim, born in Berlin, 1832, died there 1852.\r\nThough only twenty years old at his death, yet he was a Ph.D. teacher in\r\nthe Academy and a notable mathematician.\r\n\r\nELIYAHU, Rabbi Mullah, of Bushire, is recorded, together with Eliyahu of\r\nBagdad, as having been baptized at Bagdad in 1852. The father of the\r\nlatter had lost his occupation among the Jewish community on account of\r\nthat, and this Eliyahu afterwards accompanied Stern on his journey to\r\nMosul and Kurdistan.\r\n\r\nELKANA, Rabbi Paulus, of Prague. Superintendent Olarius, who wrote a\r\npreface to a Hebrew translation of the Augsburg confession prepared by\r\nPhilipp Gallus in 1888, reports of the above rabbi who had been his\r\nteacher, that he was converted to the Christian faith through reading a\r\nHebrew translation of the Gospel by St. Matthew and of the Epistle to\r\nthe Romans.\r\n\r\nELVIN, Johannes, carried on missionary work among the Jews in Hamburg in\r\n1850, under great political difficulties.\r\n\r\nEMIN, Pasha (Edward Carl Oscar Theodor Schnitzer), born at Oppeln,\r\nPrussian Silesia, in 1840; killed at Kinena Station, Congo Free State,\r\nOctober 23, 1892. When he was only six years old his parents had him\r\nbaptized in the Protestant Church at Neisse. Whether this famous\r\nexplorer remained a Christian or not is uncertain, but his parents must\r\nhave either embraced Christianity before or at the time of his baptism.\r\n\r\nEPPSTEIN, Rev. John Moses (Levi, such was his name at first), was born\r\nat Memel, in Prussia, Feb. 24, 1827, being the son of Elijah Levi and\r\nRose, his wife (_née_ Eppstein). Soon after his birth his father died,\r\nand he was brought up by his grandfather, Rabbi Benjamin Eppstein, who\r\nretired to Jerusalem when his grandson was nine years old, adopting him\r\nas his son, and making him take the name of Eppstein. Until he was\r\nsixteen years old Moses was taught little else than Hebrew and the\r\nTalmud. About this time several friends of his became Christians. At\r\nfirst the only effect on him of their conversion was to make him more\r\nbigoted; indeed, he went about with a dagger for some time in the hope\r\nof killing his cousin Lauria, a rabbi who had become a Christian. At\r\nlast, through the latter, he was led to study the Prophets, and\r\neventually the New Testament. After this his eyes began to be opened to\r\nthe truth as he saw fact and figure, and type fulfilled in Jesus of\r\nNazareth, who must have been the promised Messiah. The Talmud was put\r\naside for the whole written Word of God; this he studied at the risk of\r\nbeing killed, the reading of even the Old Testament causing suspicion.\r\nHe had therefore to resort to all sorts of contrivances to enable him to\r\nsearch the Scriptures. His own words tell out his feelings at this\r\ntime:--\"My convictions deepened daily, and I longed to openly confess\r\nthe Lord Jesus; but I had not the courage to give up all for Him. All\r\nsorts of thoughts swayed my mind, and often, when my conscience troubled\r\nme, something would whisper to my troubled heart, 'When you grow up and\r\nget your property you will be free to embrace Christianity, now your\r\nwisdom is to hide your convictions.' But I was not happy, and continued\r\npraying, and the Lord heard my prayer, for I was soon compelled to take\r\nrefuge with the Society's missionaries. In the house where I lived there\r\nwas a small synagogue. I was the only Levite in the congregation, so\r\nthat on days when the Law was read I had to read after the priest; as I\r\nwas going up to the desk my sash caught, and the tracts I had in it fell\r\nout. The bystanders stepped forward to see what they were; on finding\r\ntheir contents, 'Apostate,' they yelled, 'with these about you, you\r\ndesecrate our place of worship, and dare even to go up to read the Law!'\r\nThe whole congregation began beating me, and would probably have\r\nmurdered me, had it not been for one of them. As soon as I was free from\r\nmy persecutors, my only safety was in flight. I went to my room, and\r\ncommitted myself in prayer to the Lord, and then went straight to the\r\nhouse of Mr. Nicolayson.\" After a course of instruction he was baptized,\r\nJuly 13, 1844, by Bishop Alexander.\r\n\r\nAfter his baptism he found a situation in Cairo, in which he stayed for\r\nseveral years, until he felt the missionary call. His employer did his\r\nbest to prevent him leaving, even to offering him a share in his\r\nbusiness. But his mind was made up, and he entered the Protestant\r\nCollege at Malta, as a theological student, spending five years there.\r\nHe then offered himself to the Society, and in 1854 entered the Hebrew\r\nCollege in Palestine Place. In 1857 he was appointed a missionary of\r\nthe Society at Bagdad. The results of his work are summed up in his own\r\nwords, \"The mission was a great success, not from the number of\r\nbaptisms, but from the large numbers to whom we preached Christ.\" In\r\n1867 he commenced his great work at Smyrna, where, through his labours\r\nduring eighteen years, many Jews were born again, and were baptized. In\r\n1885 he left Smyrna. One who knew him and his work there wrote after his\r\ndeath, \"Mr. Eppstein will ever be remembered by thousands of Jews living\r\nat Smyrna, and in the interior of Asia Minor. When his death became\r\nknown many Jews said, 'He was a good man, and loved our people.' He had\r\nfriends amongst the rich as well as the poor, whilst learned and\r\nunlearned looked up to him for his great learning and Talmudical\r\nknowledge.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1885, on the death of Dr. Stern, he was appointed head of the\r\nSociety's mission in London, a post for which he was singularly fitted.\r\nHe knew English, German, French, Hebrew, Yiddish, Spanish, Greek (both\r\nmodern and classic), Latin, Syriac, Chaldee, Felachi (the Nestorian\r\ndialect of Chaldee), Persian, Italian, and Turkish. In 1893 he removed\r\nto Bristol, in charge of the \"Wanderers' Home.\" Here his work was\r\ngreatly blessed, as many as eighty-two Jews being baptized by him up to\r\n1902. During his missionary career he baptized 262 Jews and Jewesses.\r\n\r\nAt last, in May, 1903, his call came to higher service. Shortly before\r\nhis death, though suffering greatly, he said he was \"the happiest man in\r\nthe world,\" and again, \"I thank God that He enabled me to lay hold of\r\nthe Pearl, and to lay hold of it with both my hands.\" The Society\r\nsuffered a great loss when Mr. Eppstein passed away to his eternal rest.\r\nAs a missionary he was to the end most able and faithful, and his life\r\nand life work will ever be remembered with heartfelt gratitude to the\r\nAlmighty God for all that he was able to do through a life so fully\r\ndedicated to His service, as was that of the late John Moses Eppstein.\r\n\r\nEWALD, Rev. Dr. F. C.[12] In the middle of last century there was no\r\nname more familiar to the friends of Israel than that of Dr. Ferdinand\r\nChristian Ewald; and no missionary to the Jews was more highly honoured\r\nfor his work's sake than this distinguished son of Abraham.\r\n\r\n\r\n[12] \"Biographies of Eminent Hebrew Christians,\" W. T. Gidney.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat difficult to write a memoir of one who was too modest and\r\nretiring to say or to write much about himself: and who left but few\r\nmaterials from which to frame a biography, for it was his express wish\r\nthat no lengthened life should be written. He felt that his record was\r\nin Heaven, and that his works would follow him. As he has been at rest\r\nfor over thirty years, we think that the time has come when an account\r\nof his life should be added to that of other labourers in the same\r\nfield, in which he was by no means the least conspicuous worker.\r\n\r\nEwald was born of Jewish parents, on September 14th, 1801, at the\r\nvillage of Maroldsweisach, near Bamberg, Bavaria. His parents were poor,\r\nand the education which the village offered was all they could command.\r\nSuch, however, was his ability that his friends raised a fund sufficient\r\nto send him and his brother (mentioned on page 215) to a better school,\r\nwhere he evinced a great aptitude for languages. Later on he entered the\r\nmissionary college at Basle. Whilst there he was baptized, in 1824, at\r\nthe age of twenty-three, by the Rev. Dr. Von Brunn, adding the name of\r\nChristian to his patronymic. He remained at Basle for a few years\r\nlonger, during which the Society paid a part of his training expenses.\r\nHe subsequently graduated at the University of Erlangen. In 1829 he was\r\naccepted as a student in the Society's College, and in 1832 he entered\r\nthe service of the Society. He took Lutheran orders in the same year,\r\nbeing ordained at Lörrach, near Basle, by the Decanus Hiltzig. These he\r\nsubsequently laid aside, when he was ordained by the Bishop of London,\r\nin 1836.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1832, he visited his native country for the purpose\r\nof seeing his mother, his sister and her husband, who resided at\r\nBischberg, near Bamberg, and were still of the Jewish faith. His sister\r\ntold him, before he parted from her, that she believed that Jesus was\r\nthe Messiah and Redeemer. His brother Dr. Paulus Ewald, had already\r\nrenounced Judaism, and was Lutheran Pastor at Merkendorf, Bavaria.\r\n\r\nEwald's missionary career naturally falls into three periods: the first,\r\n1832-41, spent in the Barbary States; the second, 1841-1851, in\r\nJerusalem; and the third and last, 1851-1874, in London. His work was\r\nthus both wide in extent and lengthened in duration.\r\n\r\nEwald commenced his work in Africa on September 17th, 1832, by opening\r\na mission at Algiers. The Rev. John Nicolayson, of Jerusalem, having\r\nvisited that city in the spring of that year, and having met with a\r\ncordial reception, came to the conclusion that the newly-emancipated\r\nJews (_i.e._, from the Moorish to the French dominion in 1830), were\r\nripe for a missionary effort. Consequently Ewald was sent out in the\r\nautumn. His reception, however, was chilling in the extreme.\r\n\r\nThe moment he landed he was told by the Custom House authorities, when\r\nthey saw the Bibles which he had brought with him for distribution, \"You\r\nhave chosen the worst part of the world for your good intentions; there\r\nis nothing to be done in that way here.\" His answer was, \"This book, the\r\nBible, has already done great things, and I trust the Lord will bless it\r\nalso in this country.\" Discouragement crossed Ewald at every turn, for\r\nhe wrote: \"All those whom I met with, and to whom I stated the object of\r\nmy mission, told me that there was nothing to be done here, because the\r\npeople are too bad--that the Jews are the worst set of people that exist\r\nin the world--and that most of the Europeans who have come over are the\r\noutcasts of human society. I believe this to be true, but I think,\r\nbecause this is true, I am in my proper place; the Gospel of Christ is\r\nable to convert man, to convert even publicans to righteousness.\"\r\n\r\nEwald commenced to work amongst the Jews speaking to them and selling\r\nhis Hebrew Bibles. On one day he sold as many as nineteen copies for\r\ntwenty-six francs, a large sum from poor Jews; but they would not take\r\nthe New Testament. He also hired a house, intending to have services\r\nthere for Jews, when the French Governor-General sent him a letter\r\nforbidding him to preach. This was a great blow, virtually suspending\r\nmissionary operations, and Ewald left Algiers.\r\n\r\nHis next attempt to found a mission in the Barbary States was more\r\nfortunate, and he had the honour of establishing the Society's mission\r\nin Tunis, in 1833, laying the foundation of the extensive and\r\nencouraging work now carried on by the Rev. C. F. W. Flad, the son of\r\nthe Society's veteran Abyssinian missionary, Mr. J. Martin Flad.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Ewald's appointment to Tunis, which was before the days\r\nof the French occupation, the Jews were greatly oppressed by the native\r\npopulation. Indeed his very first experience, gained before his actual\r\narrival, gave him an insight into the way in which this persecution was\r\ncarried on. At Goletta, the port of Tunis, he met more than 300 Jewish\r\nmen, women and children, who were seeing some of their friends off to\r\nJerusalem. He says:--\r\n\r\n\"I saw a specimen of the cruel treatment the poor Jews meet with in this\r\ncountry. Some of those who accompanied their brethren to the Goletta sat\r\ndown upon a bank, from which they could look to the ships where they\r\nembarked for Jerusalem; but soon there came a Moor with a stick in his\r\nhand, and drove them away. An old Jew, with a white beard, spoke some\r\nwords to the man which I could not hear, as I was standing too far off;\r\non this the Moor got into a passion, and smote the poor Jew repeatedly\r\nin his face. I cannot express what I felt when seeing this--'O! that the\r\nSalvation of Israel would come out of Zion; O! that the Lord would bring\r\nback the captivity of His people; then,' and only then, 'will Jacob\r\nrejoice, and Israel be glad!' Now poor Israel is oppressed everywhere\r\nmore or less.\"\r\n\r\nEwald made a very successful beginning amongst the Jews of Tunis, and\r\nfound an open door in that dark and benighted country. Within three\r\nmonths he had sold 398 Bibles, New Testaments, and portions in Hebrew,\r\nArabic, Italian, Greek, Spanish and French, for in so many different\r\nlanguages had the work to be carried on.\r\n\r\nHe instituted a service on Sunday, and had much intercourse with Jews,\r\nincluding several rabbis, one of whom was excommunicated for visiting\r\nhim. Ewald used to visit the Jewish quarter with his pockets full of\r\ntracts.\r\n\r\nIn July of 1834 Ewald visited Monastir and Susa, at both of which places\r\nhe was able to proclaim the Gospel to numbers of Jews. He was back at\r\nTunis in September, and at once resumed his intercourse with Jews. He\r\nsays:--\"I have from morning till night every possible opportunity for\r\npreaching the unsearchable riches of Christ Jesus our Lord to Jews and\r\nMahometans, sometimes in my own dwelling-place--at other times in their\r\nhabitations, or shops, synagogues, or in the market-place. The desire to\r\nread and to possess the Word of God is daily increasing among the\r\nremnant of Israel in this country. Even the very poor save a few\r\nshillings in order to buy the pearl of great price. Others who are even\r\ntoo poor to follow their example, made an agreement to pay a few pence\r\nevery week. Doors have been opened for the circulation of the Scriptures\r\nalong the coast and in some places in the interior.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1835 Ewald visited the Jews along the northern coast of\r\nAfrica--Solimon, Nabal, Hammamet, Susa, Monastir, Medea, El-Djem, Sfax,\r\nGabes, Menzel, Shara, the Island of Gerba, and Tripoli were visited, and\r\nthe Gospel preached to many thousands and thousands of copies of the\r\nBible were placed in their hands, and tens of thousands of tracts\r\ncirculated. Most interesting records of this visit remain, to one of\r\nwhich we cannot refrain from referring. Ewald was preaching on the wild\r\nshores of Gabes, where the Jews had never so much as heard of Christ,\r\nbut where the general cry was, \"Give me a Bible; give me a Bible; here\r\nis the money for it!\" so that he had none left for other places, at\r\nwhich the poor Jews cried out for the Word of God, like children\r\nperishing with hunger.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 Ewald made a visit to England for ordination, but was soon back\r\nat his work again. We cannot follow this devoted and faithful missionary\r\nin his untiring efforts for the lost sheep of Israel in Africa, and must\r\nbe content with giving his own summary of his labours. On the last day\r\nof the year 1838, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"I have now been since 1832 on the coast of Africa. It has been my\r\nprivilege to proclaim the Gospel of salvation to many thousands of the\r\nsons of Abraham during that period. To thousands I have been permitted\r\nto present the oracles of God, and tens of thousands of tracts have been\r\nput into circulation among the great mass of the Jewish population of\r\nthis country. The effect produced by these various means of grace may be\r\nthus described: The greater part of the Jews know now that Christianity\r\nis not a system of idolatry, but a revelation of God built upon the\r\nScriptures; that the precepts of the Gospel are very good and beneficial\r\nto mankind. They acknowledge, for the most part, that the only\r\ndifference which exists between the Christians and the Jews is, that the\r\nformer maintain the Messiah is come, and Jesus Christ is the Messiah,\r\nwhilst the latter deny both, which may, however, fairly be decided by\r\nthe Word of God. They perceive that true Christians are not the enemies\r\nof the Jews, but, on the contrary, their well-wishers, who provide them\r\nwith the Scriptures, and pray for their real welfare. The greater part\r\nof them are now acquainted with the written Word of God, and we are able\r\nto appeal with more effect to the testimony of Scripture without being\r\nconstantly told, 'These passages do not occur in our Bibles, but are a\r\nfabrication of yours, in order to make us believe that Jesus is the\r\nMessiah.'\"\r\n\r\nFor three years more Ewald carried on the work, and then, owing to\r\nrepeated attacks of ophthalmia, he had to return to England in 1841,\r\nafter a residence of some eight years in the Barbary States.\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, long remain idle, for he was within a few months\r\nappointed to assist in the Society's Mission in Jerusalem, and he and\r\nhis wife were members of the party which accompanied Dr. Alexander, the\r\nfirst Anglican Bishop, to the Holy City. They sailed from Portsmouth on\r\nDecember 7th, 1841, and reached Jerusalem on January 21st--being six\r\nweeks on the journey, which is now accomplished in nine or ten days.\r\n\r\nFor ten years Ewald laboured earnestly in the work of the conversion of\r\nthe Jewish inhabitants of Jerusalem, being also chaplain to Bishop\r\nAlexander during that prelate's occupation of the see.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting incidents connected with Ewald's labours in\r\nthe Holy City was the instruction and baptism of certain rabbis. Three,\r\nnamed respectively, Abraham, Benjamin, and Eliezer, had placed\r\nthemselves under Christian instruction. A deputation from the Jews of\r\nTiberias arrived to enquire whether the report was true, that fourteen\r\nrabbis of Jerusalem had embraced Christianity. The Jews of Jerusalem,\r\nvery much exasperated on that account, did all in their power to avoid\r\ncoming in contact with the missionaries, and removed all the books which\r\nthey had previously received through the mission, in order that they\r\nmight not be suspected.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards two of the rabbis, Eliezer and Benjamin, known\r\nhenceforth as Christian Lazarus Lauria and John Benjamin Goldberg, were\r\nbaptized with two other enquirers, Isaac Paul Hirsch and Simon Peter\r\nFränkel. The Rev. John Nicolayson, the head of the Society's mission,\r\nreferring to the event, wrote: \"It is not a small thing, that the\r\napparently impenetrable phalanx of rabbinism at Jerusalem has thus\r\nactually been broken into; and two Jerusalem rabbis been incorporated\r\ninto the restored Hebrew Christian Church on Mount Zion. How sore the\r\nJews felt on this occasion you can easily conceive. They were, in fact,\r\nafter all, taken by surprise, and felt sadly disappointed in having to\r\nyield up at last any lingering hope they might have had of their\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\nOf the third rabbi, Abraham, Mr. Ewald said: \"There was, indeed,\r\nsomething which marred my joy on that occasion, which was the absence of\r\nrabbi Abraham. For years had he been the faithful companion of rabbi\r\nEliezer and rabbi Benjamin; he had the same convictions, but he could\r\nnot leave his wife; the struggles between natural affection and\r\nspiritual blessings were too hard for him, and he returned.\" Ewald\r\nwitnessed other interesting missionary events at Jerusalem, which had a\r\ngreat bearing upon the subsequent history of the Society; namely, the\r\nbaptism of John Moses Eppstein, and the ordination of Messrs.\r\nTartakover, A. J. Behrens, Sternchuss, Murray Vicars, and Henry Aaron\r\nStern.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of his sojourn there, Ewald had the great\r\nmisfortune to lose his wife, who died on January 16th, 1844. He brought\r\nhis motherless children to London, but returned to Jerusalem in 1846,\r\njust after his second marriage. In the same year he published a \"Journal\r\nof Missionary Labours in the City of Jerusalem, during the years\r\n1842-4,\" which are exceedingly interesting reading, even after this\r\nlapse of time.\r\n\r\nIt is striking to note that at that time the Jewish population of\r\nJerusalem was only 6,000, out of a total of 18,000; whereas the Jewish\r\npopulation now [1909] numbers 60,000, out of a total of 80,000.\r\n\r\nEwald was compelled to leave the East, owing to ill-health, in 1851,\r\nwhen he became the Society's senior missionary in London. He at once\r\nmade his way into the hearts and homes of many Jews, and founded, in\r\nNovember, 1853, an institution for poor enquiring Jews, called \"The\r\nWanderers' Home.\" Such was its success that within five years 303 Jews\r\nand Jewesses had availed themselves of its benefits, no less than 150\r\nbeing baptized; 76 entered the Operative Jewish Converts' Institution,\r\nand six went to the Society's College. In 1858, owing to lack of\r\nfinancial support, the Home was closed. It was, however, re-opened in\r\n1860, and has, under Dr. Ewald's and successive management, been the\r\nmeans of influencing large numbers of Jews in a Christian direction.\r\n\r\nEwald's reports of his work are full of encouraging missionary facts. He\r\nwas in labours \"most abundant,\" both for the Society and the \"Wanderers'\r\nHome.\" For nineteen years he was at the head of affairs, and at least\r\nforty Jewish families in London were brought through his means to faith\r\nin Christ. He was one of the ablest missionaries who ever served the\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 Ewald thus wrote of the work: \"Certainly, mighty changes have\r\ntaken place amongst those Jews to whom the missionary has not been\r\ndebarred an access. If you go into their houses, you find on their table\r\nthe Bible, the Old and New Testament, just as you see it on the table of\r\nChristians, and I have seen the authorized version of the Bible not only\r\nin private houses, but in the synagogue. When you converse with\r\nintelligent Jews, you soon observe that they have read the New\r\nTestament, and other Christian books and that they know what the\r\nfundamental doctrines of Christianity are, namely: the fall of man; the\r\nredemption of mankind through the Lord Jesus Christ; the atonement; the\r\nDeity of Christ; the doctrine of the Trinity, &c.; and they know also\r\nthat every true Christian believes these doctrines. Then, much of the\r\nanimosity towards converts has been gradually removed, by the number of\r\nJews who have embraced Christianity. You cannot meet with many Jewish\r\nfamilies who do not count among their relatives some converts. I have\r\nmyself heard Jews defending their friends, not for having embraced\r\nChristianity, but from the alleged imputation of having embraced it\r\nthrough impure motives. The more Christianity gains ground in the Jewish\r\ncommunity, the more will friendly feelings arise towards those of their\r\nnumber who conscientiously look upon the Lord Jesus as the Christ.\r\nAmongst fifty thousand Jews in England we reckon three thousand\r\nconverts. In London alone there are eleven ministers of the Lord Jesus\r\nChrist who are converted Jews, preaching the Word of Life to perishing\r\nsinners, whose ministry the Lord owns by granting them many souls for\r\ntheir hire. These thousands of converts are as a salt in the earth, and\r\nthrough their instrumentality a work is carried on silently and quietly\r\nin this country. They have all acquaintances and friends, to whom they\r\nspeak occasionally of the Lord Jesus; and thus true religion is spread\r\namong the Jews.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1870, Dr. Ewald, owing to increasing years, retired from the\r\nmission, he could thankfully look back upon a successful career, whether\r\npassed in North Africa, Palestine, or London. During his residence in\r\nthe metropolis hundreds of Jews were baptized, out of some thousands\r\ninstructed by him.\r\n\r\nDr. Ewald died at Gipsy Hill, London, on August 9th, 1874, at the age of\r\n73 years.\r\n\r\nEwald published in 1856 a German translation of \"Abodah Zarah\"\r\n(Idolatrous Worship), the name of one of the treatises of the Mishnah,\r\nof the Tosefta, and of the Babylonian and the Palestinian Talmud, for\r\nwhich his University conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of\r\nPhilosophy. A distinction which he valued still more highly was the\r\ndegree of Bachelor of Divinity, which honour was conferred upon him by\r\nthe Patron of the Society, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in\r\nconsideration of, as the diploma stated, his proficiency in the study of\r\ndivinity, of Hebrew and Oriental languages and literature; and also of\r\nhis missionary labours and eminent services in the promotion of\r\nChristianity amongst the Jews.\r\n\r\nThe then Bishop of Carlisle (Dr. Montagu Villiers) described Dr. Ewald\r\nas a \"missionary genius,\" a description fully deserved for his ability\r\nand devotion to the work to which he gave his life.\r\n\r\nEWALD, Dr. Paulus, a brother of the preceding, also embraced\r\nChristianity. He was lecturer at the University of Erlangen, and later\r\nbecame Pastor of Pappenreuth, Bavaria. He published a translation of the\r\nTalmud tract, \"Pirke Aboth\" (The Ethics of the Fathers), in 1825.\r\n\r\nEZEKIEL, Hakim David, a physician and famous Talmudist at Bagdad, and\r\nson of a rich Jew, was baptized there in 1850, and subsequently laboured\r\nas a colporteur in the mission.\r\n\r\nFALK, Max, Hungarian statesman and journalist, born at Budapest in 1828,\r\nbecame a Christian as a student at the University. He displayed great\r\ntalent as a writer and politician. In 1866 he was appointed as\r\ninstructor of Hungarian to the Empress Elizabeth. The next year he\r\nbecame editor-in-chief to the \"Pester Lloyd,\" raising that paper to a\r\nhigh level of excellence. In 1869 he was elected a member of the\r\nHungarian House of Representatives. The Emperor of Austria has decorated\r\nhim with the Komthur Cross of the Order of St. Stephen.\r\n\r\nFANTA, Kendy, together with Beru and I. Jasu, were indefatigable in\r\nproclaiming the Gospel of salvation to their brethren during the\r\ncaptivity of the missionaries in Abyssinia.\r\n\r\nFARO, Aharon Gabai Rodriguez, a rich Portuguese Jew living in Holland in\r\nthe seventeenth century, was converted through reading Ragstatt de\r\nWeile's tract, \"de Heerlykheyd Jesu Christi,\" and having heard of an\r\nattempt that was made by a Jewish teacher to murder the author, he\r\ndecided to be baptized by him. Ragstatt himself mentioned the case in\r\nthe sermon which he preached on the occasion on Ps. ii. 6.\r\n\r\nFAUBER, of Gran, a highly respected Jew in Pesth, was baptized in 1847.\r\n\r\nFAY, I. L., was won for Christ in 1820 by the L.J.S. missionary L. D.\r\nMark, who laboured at Offenbach. Fay studied theology and became Pastor\r\nin the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland.\r\n\r\nFELS, Christian Leberecht, born in 1640, became eventually Rabbi in\r\nPrague. After embracing Christianity at Cöthen, he returned to Prague\r\nand claimed his patrimony, but the Government authorities refused to\r\nsanction it unless he became a Roman Catholic. So he had to seek his\r\nlivelihood by teaching Hebrew and rabbinics in various schools and\r\nUniversities. To convince his brethren of the truth of Christianity, he\r\nwrote in German a treatise under the title \"Hodegus Judæorum\" (Frankfort\r\nand Leipzig, 1703), in which he, besides the Scriptures, adduces proofs\r\nfrom the Targums and the Talmud in favour of Christianity. He published\r\na Latin Hebrew Grammar under the title \"Brevis et perspicua via ad\r\nlinguam sanctam\" (Sunderhausen, 1696). Also \"Brevis et perspicua via ad\r\naccentionem,\" 1700. No less than 52 Jews were influenced by him to\r\naccept the Gospel. He held a Professorship at Wittenberg, but on account\r\nof war he had to leave, and went to Verden and Lubeck, where he gave\r\nlessons. He died in the faith at Hamburg in 1719.\r\n\r\nFERDINAND, Philip: \"Hebrew teacher; born in Poland about 1555; died at\r\nLeyden, Holland, 1598. After an adventurous career on the Continent,\r\nduring which he became first a Roman Catholic and afterward a\r\nProtestant, he went to Oxford University, and later removed to the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge, where he was matriculated Dec. 16th 1596. He\r\nclaimed a pension from the 'Domus Conversorum,' which was paid Feb. 3rd,\r\n1598, and receipted for by him in Latin, Hebrew, and Greek. The same\r\nyear he was attracted to Leyden by Joseph Scaliger, who obtained a\r\nprofessorship for him. Scaliger himself acknowledges having learned much\r\nfrom Ferdinand, in the short time he was at Leyden. Ferdinand's only\r\npublication was a translation of the six hundred and thirteen\r\ncommandments as collected by Abraham ben 'Kattani' in the Bomberg Bible\r\n(Cambridge 1597.)\r\n\r\n\"The following is a list of his writings: 'Dictionary of National\r\nBiography'; Wood, 'Athenæ Oxnienses,' ed. Bliss, i. 677; Cooper, 'Athenæ\r\nCantabrigienses,' ii. 239; Scaliger, 'Epistolæ,' pp. 208, 594, Leyden,\r\n1627; 'Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society,' Eng. i.\r\n27.\"--_Jewish Encyclopædia._\r\n\r\nFINKELSTEIN, Rev. A. M., had a school for Jewish children in\r\nPhiladelphia in 1885.\r\n\r\nFINKELSTEIN, Rev. Samuel, a convert from Russia, emigrated to Australia\r\nand became pastor of a German church at Melbourne, where he also founded\r\na mission to the Jews in 1868.\r\n\r\nFLEGEL, Petrus, a convert, was Professor of Hebrew at the University of\r\nStrassburg in 1564. More is not known of him.\r\n\r\nFLEISCHALKER, Rev. J. C, was educated at St. Chrischona College, near\r\nBasle. He laboured for a time as L.J.S. missionary in Jerusalem, where\r\nhe was ordained by Bishop Gobat. In 1868 he became pastor of St.\r\nGeorge's Episcopal Chapel, New York. He was a true servant of God.\r\n\r\nFORTUNATUS, Wilhelm, a physician, became a convert to Christianity\r\nthrough the simple reading of the New Testament, and was baptized in\r\nBaden in 1639, (Wolff, Bibliotheca Hebraica 1, p. 564).\r\n\r\nFOULD, Achille, French Statesman and Minister of Finance under two\r\nNapoleons, born in Paris in 1800 died in 1867. In the Jewish\r\nEncyclopædia, it is stated that he married into a Protestant family, and\r\nhis children were educated in that faith, but he never formally abjured\r\nJudaism, though he was buried with the rites of the Protestant Church.\r\nBut de le Roi states that in his ripe age, with full convictions, he\r\njoined the Reformed Church, of which he had always been a true member.\r\nThe two statements are easily reconciled. He was a regular attendant at\r\nthat Church for many years, but was only baptized in his old age. (See\r\n\"Jewish Intelligence,\" 1868, p. 13.)\r\n\r\nFRANCO, Rabbi Solomon, baptized in London in 1670. Wolff in Bib. Heb.\r\n1678 records the fact that he took Ps. lxxxv. 11 as his motto, \"Truth\r\nshall spring out of the earth,\" and tried to convince the Jews that the\r\nearthly promises to Israel have a higher spiritual meaning in their\r\nbeing realized in Christ Jesus.\r\n\r\nFRANCO, Abraham and Jacob, Portuguese Jews, who had once the first city\r\nhouses in London. Their posterity have all become Christians, according\r\nto Peixotto.\r\n\r\nFRANK, Rev. Arnold, born in Hungary, baptized in 1877 at Hamburg,\r\nstudied theology at Belfast, was appointed missionary at Altona in 1884,\r\nwhere he [1909] still labours faithfully with tokens of divine blessing.\r\nHe is the author of a pamphlet entitled \"The Jewish Problem and its\r\nSolution\" (Belfast, 1883).\r\n\r\nFRANKEL, Dr. B., has written his own history entitled, \"Das Bekenntniss\r\ndes Proselyten, das Unglück der Juden und ihre Emanzipation in\r\nDeutschland\" (Elberfeld, 1841).\r\n\r\nFRANKEL, Rev. E. B., was first a missionary of the British Society, and\r\nthen entered the service of the L.J.S., and laboured successfully at\r\nJerusalem until 1869, where he had the privilege of baptizing his own\r\nbrother. From Jerusalem he was transferred to Damascus, where he\r\nlaboured for some years both as a missionary and chaplain to the English\r\ncommunity, holding evening classes and meeting the Jews at the book\r\ndepôt; the latter was once set on fire. Then he went to Tunis, and\r\ntogether with his son-in-law, the Rev. E. H. Archer-Shepherd, laboured\r\nfaithfully till he retired to Bournemouth, where he died in the Lord.\r\n\r\nFRANKEL, Dr. Ivan, Medical Councillor in Berlin, became, as a convert, a\r\ngreat friend of the Jewish mission, and attended the Missionary\r\nConference in 1870.\r\n\r\nFRANKHEIM, a convert in Breslau, wrote two books: 1, \"Doctrine of\r\nCohesion\" (Breslau, 1835), 2, \"Popular Astronomy\" (_ib._, 1827 and\r\n1829).\r\n\r\nFRAUENSTADT, Christian Martin Julius, German student of philosophy, born\r\nat Boyanawo, Posen, 1813; died at Berlin, 1879. He was educated at the\r\nhouse of his uncle at Neisse, and embraced Christianity in 1833. He\r\nwrote, \"Studien und Kritiken zur Theologie und Philosophie,\" Berlin,\r\n1840; \"Ueber das Wahre Verhältniss der Vernunft zur Offenbahrung,\"\r\nDarmstadt, 1898; \"Aesthetische Fragen,\" Dessau, 1853; \"Die Natur\r\nwissenschaft in Ihren Einfluss auf Poesie, Religion, Moral, und\r\nPhilosophie,\" _ib._, 1885; \"Der Materialismus, seine Wahrheit und sein\r\nIrrthum,\" _ib._, 1856; \"Briefe über die Natürliche Religion,\" _ib._,\r\n1858; \"Lichtstrahlen aus Immanuel Kants Werken,\" _ib._, 1872. He also\r\nwrote much about Schopenhauer's philosophy, whose works he edited in six\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nFRESHMAN, Rev. Jacob, was the son of a Hungarian Rabbi, who settled in\r\nQuebec, Canada, in 1855. His father officiated in the synagogue there\r\nfor three years, and after becoming convinced of the truth of\r\nChristianity together with his wife, four sons and three daughters, were\r\nall baptized by the Rev. J. Elliot, then President of the Montreal\r\nMethodist Conference. Freshman, senior, was soon appointed as a Pastor\r\namong the Germans in the province, and laboured in this office for nine\r\nyears. On account of his ability and learning, the degree of D.D. was\r\nconferred upon him. Several Jews were also brought to a knowledge of the\r\ntruth through his ministry. He died through an accident in 1875. His son\r\nJacob was an equally able and zealous man, established a mission to the\r\nJews in New York City under the name, \"Hebrew Christian Work.\" By his\r\npopular lectures to Christians on Jewish subjects, and by his earnest\r\naddresses to Jews, he won the hearts of both, and glorious results\r\nfollowed his ministry. Many of the converts became themselves ministers\r\nof the Gospel. Having built a church especially for this work, he\r\nretired from the mission to carry on private ministerial work.\r\n\r\nFREY, Rev. (Joseph Samuel) Christian Friedrich, born at Stockheim, near\r\nWurzburg, in 1771. His father was an assistant rabbi, in good\r\ncircumstances, and a distinguished opponent of Christianity, owing to\r\nhis wife's brother having become a Christian. The children were early\r\nprejudiced against Christianity by their home teacher, who read to them\r\nthe story about Jesus as given in the \"Toldoth Yeshu.\" At the age of\r\neighteen Frey became a teacher and a precentor in small congregations.\r\nIn the course of his wanderings he met a Christian merchant, who induced\r\nhim to enquire into Christianity, and this happened repeatedly with\r\nothers. He then learned the trade of shoemaking, and was finally\r\nconverted in 1798, at Prenzlan, when his master, a worldly man,\r\ndismissed him on account of attending prayer meetings frequently.\r\nEncouraged by Christian friends he went to Berlin, and applied to Pastor\r\nJanicke for admission into his missionary training school in 1800. From\r\nthere he went to London. Then, after holding meetings with Jews in Bury\r\nStreet, Spitalfields, he wrote a most touching appeal to the Committee\r\nof the L.J.S. (or rather to those earnest Christian men who formed\r\nthemselves later into a Committee) in 1801, and thus he gave the first\r\nimpulse to the establishment of the London Society for Promoting\r\nChristianity amongst the Jews in 1809. (See \"Our Missions,\" p. 19).\r\n\r\nOf Frey's converts at that time an excellent one was Erasmus H. Simon,\r\nwho after his baptism studied theology at Edinburgh, and went with\r\nThelwall to Amsterdam, in 1820, to work in that city amongst the Jews,\r\nas he knew the Dutch language. In 1816 Frey went to America, where he\r\nassisted in the reconstruction of the already existing American Society\r\nfor Evangelizing the Jews, under the title of \"The Society for\r\nAmeliorating the Condition of the Jews in New York,\" under which he\r\nlaboured for some time.\r\n\r\nFrey is the author of a long and learned dialogue, entitled \"Joseph and\r\nBenjamin;\" also of a Hebrew Dictionary.\r\n\r\nFRIEDBERG, Emil Albert von, born in Kanitz, 1837, studied law in Berlin\r\nand Heidelberg, became eventually Professor of Ecclesiastical Law at\r\nLeipzig in 1869, and was ennobled in Wittenberg. His published works on\r\nChurch law are too numerous to mention here. (See de le Roi, vol. ii.\r\n230, 231).\r\n\r\nFRIEDBERG, Heinrich, born in Friedland, 1813, also a great lawyer,\r\nbecame, after holding important offices of state, Minister of Justice in\r\nPrussia, and received from the Emperor Frederick the Order of the Black\r\nEagle.\r\n\r\nFRIEDBERG, Eduard, also born in Friedland, in 1827, and evidently a\r\nrelative or a brother of the preceding was baptized by Pastor Ideler.\r\n\r\nFRIEDENTHAL, Karl Rudolf, embraced Christianity together with his\r\nparents and the whole family. In 1838 the family bought an estate near\r\nNeu Silesia, where they did much in the diffusion and strengthening of\r\nevangelical life in the midst of a Roman Catholic population.\r\nFriedenthal was born in Breslau, 1827, studied law, held offices under\r\nthe Government, and then retired to the family estate, devoting his time\r\nto good works. He published a pamphlet in 1864, entitled \"Solus\r\nRepublicæ Supremæ,\" in which he strongly advocated the organization of\r\ncharity to the poor. He was elected a member of the Reichsrath. During\r\nthe Franco-German war he volunteered for the purpose of nursing the\r\nwounded. He died in 1890. A near relative, Major A. D. Friedenthal,\r\nlikewise became an evangelical Christian.\r\n\r\nFRIEDLANDER, Benjamin, born 1773, the son of David Friedländer, the\r\nfriend of Mendelssohn, embraced Christianity at the age of 61, together\r\nwith his wife. They, in this respect, followed the example of their\r\nchildren. The whole family were decided Christians, and one of them, Dr.\r\nJulius Friedländer, wrote a history of the Reformation, and a history of\r\nNumismatics, and other historical works.\r\n\r\nFRIEDLANDER, Ludwig, born in Königsberg, 1824. As a Christian he became\r\nProfessor of classical Philology and Archæology. He wrote\r\n\"Wörterverzeichniss zu Homer,\" Leipzig, 1860; \"Homerische Kritik von\r\nWolf bis Grote,\" Berlin, 1853; \"Darstellungen aus der Sittengeschichte\r\nRoms,\" 3 vols., 1862-71, in which his Christian principles especially\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nFRIEDLANDER, Rev. Zebi Herman, a native of the Archduchy of Posen, was\r\nbaptized by Dr. Ewald, in London, about 1862. By his piety and\r\naffectionate gentle disposition he exercised a salutary influence over\r\nthe enquirers, whom, under Dr. Ewald, he also instructed. In 1870 he was\r\nsent by the L.J.S. to Tunis, after having laboured for a short time at\r\nManchester. In 1873 he was transferred to Jerusalem, where he was\r\nordained by Bishop Gobat. The Jerusalem Jews revered him more than any\r\nmissionary before, because he had manifested to them practical love by\r\nbeing very charitable to the poor refugees from Russia, in 1885. He was\r\nchiefly instrumental in founding the Jewish agricultural colony at\r\nArtouf. He edited at that time a paper entitled, \"Tidings from Zion.\" He\r\nwent later on to New York, where he edited \"The Peculiar People.\" He\r\ndied there whilst engaged in prayer on his knees.\r\n\r\nFRIEDMAN, Rev. George, a convert of Pastor Faltin, in Kischineff, became\r\nhis assistant there about 1885. He then translated the Lutheran\r\nCatechism into Hebrew. Having afterwards sojourned for a time in\r\nJerusalem, he went from there to London, and was after a while appointed\r\nby the British Society as missionary at Wilna, and he has since been\r\ndoing faithful work for the Master in various towns in Russia. In 1895,\r\nthe year of the great and horrible pogroms, he rendered great and\r\nimmortal service by consoling and supporting the poor suffering Jews.\r\n\r\nFRIEDMANN, Paul, born at Berlin about the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Although the son of a Jewish convert, he may exceptionally be\r\nmentioned here, as he is a very suitable illustration of the fact that\r\nChristians of Jewish origin cherish in their hearts warm affection to\r\nthe people from whom they have sprung. Moved by a feeling of compassion\r\ntowards the Jews, who suffered persecution in Russia between 1880-90, he\r\nvisited the land of Midian in 1890, with the intention of founding a\r\ncolony there. He, after due negotiation with the Egyptian Government,\r\nactually founded one in 1901, on the east side of the Gulf of Akabah,\r\nbut the new colony did not last more than two months. Internal\r\ndissensions broke out between the leaders, who were Christians, and the\r\nJews. Friedmann, who had sunk 170,000 marks in the project, brought a\r\nsuit against the Egyptian Government for £25,000. The Russian Consul in\r\nCairo also opened an investigation, and violent denunciatory articles\r\nappeared in the Egyptian press, especially in connexion with the death\r\nof one of the settlers, who had been forced to leave the encampment\r\nbecause of insubordination. In connexion with the venture Friedmann\r\nprivately published \"Das Land Madian,\" Berlin, 1891.\r\n\r\nFRIEDMANN, Rev. Ben Zion, a native of Russia educated in the strictest\r\nschool of the Pharisees, emigrated to Palestine between 1870-80, took up\r\nhis abode in Safed, where he studied the Talmud with the other disciples\r\nof the Hahamim in the Beit-hamedrash. Whilst there he found Jesus Christ\r\nas his Saviour. In the same place he has been working as a missionary\r\namong his former friends and companions for many years, and is certainly\r\nregarded by them as one who has not, by embracing Christianity,\r\nforfeited a share in the world to come. Mr. Friedmann has been to a\r\ngreat extent the means of establishing a hospital for the Jews in Safed\r\nand a school for their children. He is the author of a tract, \"Or\r\nHaolam\" (\"The Light of the World\"), and he translated \"Gideon and the\r\nAngel of the Lord\" into Hebrew.\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH, J. C., wrote several works, among which are these--\"Die Söhne\r\nJacobs,\" \"Weissagungs parallelen mit Virgil,\" Breslau, 1841, \"De\r\nChristologia Samaritanum,\" Leipzig, 1881.\r\n\r\nFROHLING, Carline, a Swedish converted Jewess, laboured as assistant\r\nmissionary at Stockholm, in 1880-82, by conducting an industrial school\r\nin which poor Jewish children were taught useful work, and by visits\r\namong the resident families, and spreading the Gospel.\r\n\r\nFROMMAN, Dr. Heinrich Christian Immanuel, physician and author, was one\r\nof the most distinguished converts in the first half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury in Germany. He had been studying in Dessau, under rabbi David\r\nFränkel, when one day he visited a tailor who, on seeing him, began to\r\nweep. Asking for the cause, the tailor said that he was grieved by the\r\nthought that such a nice young man should be lost. Fromman thereupon\r\nrebuked him sharply--but the tailor did not mind it--and offered him a\r\nNew Testament, urging him to read it. He went away, but came again\r\nanother time and asked for the same Book, but when he saw it was written\r\nin German, which he could not read, he threw it on the table and left\r\nthe house. He then went to a bookseller, wishing to buy a Bible, who\r\ndemanded a thaler for it, which he could not afford to pay. However, the\r\ntears of the tailor gave him no rest, and at last he bought the German\r\nOld Testament, and spent whole nights in learning to read. Having\r\nacquired this knowledge, he was glad to receive the New Testament and to\r\nstudy it diligently. He then went to Gotha and confessed his faith in\r\nChrist, and was baptized about 1722 or 1723. During his study of\r\nmedicine, he translated the Gospel of St. Luke into Judæo-German, in\r\n1730. Later he translated other parts of the New Testament. Having\r\nwritten the tract, \"Das Licht am Abend\" (\"Light at Eventide\"), which is\r\nstill circulated and appreciated among the Jews, he managed to acquire\r\nthe art of setting up type and of printing when he was an inmate of the\r\nCallenberg Institute, and produced the work with his own hands as well\r\nas mind. He also wrote and translated other Christian books, and\r\ncomposed the fundamental part of the rabbinic commentary on St. Luke,\r\nwhich Dr. Biesenthal perfected and brought to light.\r\n\r\nFUERST, Dr. A., a native of Pommern, Germany, when only fourteen years\r\nold, heard the L.J.S. missionary Moritz discussing Christianity with the\r\nJews in his native town, and received from him a Bible. Another time he\r\nreceived a tract from the L.J.S. missionary Hartmann, which made a\r\nstrong impression upon him. After studying in a seminary for teachers,\r\nin Schneidemuhl (Posen), he went to England, and was instructed and\r\nbaptized by the Rev. Ridley Herschell in 1856. Subsequently he was\r\nappointed by the British Society as a missionary in England. From 1867\r\nto 1871 Dr. Fürst laboured among the Jews in Stettin. He then entered\r\nthe service of the Free Church of Scotland, and was stationed at Prague,\r\nAmsterdam, and Strasburg, and latterly he retired to Stuttgart, where he\r\nstill bore testimony to the Jews of the assured hope of salvation,\r\nthrough his Master whom he so long and faithfully served. Dr. Fürst was\r\na fine scholar, and he wrote a book entitled, \"Christen und Juden Licht\r\nund Schattenbilder aus Kirche und Synagoge,\" Strasburg, 1892.\r\n\r\nGANS, Eduard, born in Berlin, 1798, studied, and through the influence\r\nof the philosopher Hegel, embraced Christianity in 1825, and in 1828\r\nbecame professor in the Berlin University. He wrote, among other works,\r\n\"Das Erbrecht in Weltgeschichtlicher Entwickelung\" (4 vols.), Stuttgart,\r\n1834, which was translated into French by Leoménie, Paris, 1845; \"Ein\r\nSystem des römischen Civil Rechts,\" Berlin, 1827. He edited Hegel's\r\n\"Geschichte der Philosophie,\" and \"Jahrbücher für wissenschaftliche\r\nKritik.\" He died as professor in 1839.\r\n\r\nGELBFLAUM, Rev. Isidor, was born in the city of Warsaw, in Russian\r\nPoland, in the year 1865, of orthodox Jewish parents. We cull the\r\nfollowing from his autobiography:--\"My father was a corn merchant in\r\nvery comfortable circumstances. His desire from the day of my birth was\r\nto bring me up in strict adherence with Rabbinical traditions, and I, on\r\nmy part, followed dutifully and cheerfully the guidance of my dear\r\nfather. But very early in my career, God graciously intervened, and in\r\n1877 I came into contact with a colporteur of the British and Foreign\r\nBible Society, who sold me a copy of the Hebrew New Testament. Though I\r\nwas only then in my thirteenth year, I nevertheless read the\r\nnewly-acquired treasure with intense longing to find out whether Jesus\r\nof Nazareth was the Messiah. I used diligently to read the New Testament\r\nwhenever the opportunity presented itself. One day my father suddenly\r\ncame into the room where I was reading the Acts of the Apostles. He\r\nimmediately demanded the production of the book, and I instantly gave it\r\nto him. A few weeks later on I had occasion to be in the market-place,\r\nand I purchased another copy of the same colporteur, which I read with\r\ngreater caution. Although I thus read the Book again and again, I could\r\nnot understand it, much less could I apply its contents. I was like the\r\nEthiopian eunuch, and needed some one to explain to me the meaning of\r\nthe revelation of God's purpose to mankind. Soon after an event occurred\r\nwhich contributed greatly to determining my spiritual future. My\r\nparents, noticing the abatement of my zeal for rabbinical Judaism,\r\ndecided to send me to a _Yeshiba_, and they determined on Pressburg, in\r\nHungary. I had not been in Pressburg more than a week, when I was\r\nbrought into contact with a Hebrew Christian missionary from Vienna, who\r\nwas visiting the place at the time for missionary work. He spent over an\r\nhour with me explaining the things of God, and directing my attention\r\nto the Messiahship of the Lord Jesus. I remained in Pressburg till the\r\nspring of 1881, after which I returned to Warsaw. In 1885 a Protestant\r\nChristian lady in Warsaw became interested in me, and by her advice, and\r\nwith a letter of introduction to the late Rev. Dr. Stern, I came to\r\nEngland in June of that year, only to find that my would-be instructor\r\nhad been called home to his rest. I waited till the arrival of the Rev.\r\nJ. M. Eppstein, who instructed me and subsequently baptized me in 1886.\r\nI then entered the Operative Jewish Converts' Institution, and passed\r\nthe following two years there in happy association with other converts\r\nto Christ. In 1888 I offered my services to and was accepted by the\r\nLondon City Mission, and worked among my brethren in the East End of\r\nLondon till March, 1893, when I was appointed by the British Society,\r\nand ultimately sent to Leeds. Since coming to that city, I have been the\r\nhumble instrument, in God's hand, of leading many of my brethren to\r\nChrist, two of whom have become Christian ministers, one in the west of\r\nEngland and the other in the United States of America. A third convert\r\ngiven to me is an earnest Sunday school teacher, and a fourth a local\r\npreacher.\"\r\n\r\nGELLERT, Alexander, was a missionary of the L.J.S., first in England and\r\nthen, in 1861, in Roumania, where he had some fruits of his labours, and\r\ndied in 1870.\r\n\r\nGELLING, Michael, was born 1597, and baptized 1616. He translated in\r\nHamburg R. Isaac Troki's \"Chizzuk Emunah,\" 1633, into German. Dr. John\r\nMüller made use of this MS. in his \"Judaismus detectus,\" 1694, and it\r\ncame into possession of M. Chr. Ziegra. Wolff in his \"Bibliotheca\r\nHebraica,\" iv. p. 639, gives detailed information about this MS. and a\r\nspecimen of Gelling's translation. Bishop Kidder wrote a refutation of\r\nthe \"Chizzuk Emunah\" in his \"Demonstration of the Messiah,\" in 1694.\r\nJacob Gusset likewise in his \"Controversarium adversus Judaeos ternio,\"\r\nDortrecht, 1688. The whole was edited by Arnold Borst, and published in\r\n1712, at Amsterdam, under the title, \"Jesu Christi Evangeliique Veritas,\r\nsalutifera, demonstrata in confutatione libri Chizzuk Emunah.\" The Rev.\r\nA. Lukyn Williams is now answering the same in English, and the writer\r\nis translating it into Yiddish.\r\n\r\nGERMANUS, Johannes Isaac Levita, having been convinced that Isaiah liii.\r\nwas a Messianic prophecy and fulfilled in Jesus, was baptized with his\r\nwife and his son Stephen by Joh. Draconites in 1546. Later he became\r\nprofessor of Hebrew in London and in Cologne. He wrote a controversial\r\nwork entitled: \"Defensio veritatis Hebraicae,\" Cologne, 1558, also a\r\nHebrew grammar, \"Mebo Imre Shofar,\" which passed through several\r\neditions; a treatise on the book of Ruth; and translated some of the\r\nworks of Maimonides and Juda Ibn Tibon into Latin. His son, Stephen, who\r\nwas a physician, translated the prophet Malachi into Latin.\r\n\r\nGEROLD, Rev. G. L., was a rabbinical student in Breslau, baptized by Dr.\r\nStern in the year of his death, graduated at Cambridge, was ordained in\r\n1898, and is now Rector of Easthope, Much Wenlock, Salop, in the diocese\r\nof Hereford.\r\n\r\nGERSON, Christian ben Meir Biberbach, born at Reeklichhausen, August 1,\r\n1567, received the usual Talmudical education, and was a teacher in\r\nseveral places. A neighbour, who was a Christian woman, borrowed from\r\nhim ten pence, giving him as security a Lutheran New Testament. Curious\r\nto know the source of the Christian errors, he and his two\r\nbrothers-in-law read it with much amusement. Yet finding there\r\nquotations from the Old Testament, he continued reading it more\r\nearnestly, comparing Scripture with Scripture, until his conscience was\r\nawakened and felt the need of salvation through Christ. He wrote\r\nafterwards--\"I found such light, for which I have to thank the Lord God\r\nall my life.\" He was baptized by Pastor Silberschlag at Halberstadt,\r\nOctober 19, 1600. Gerson's son Stephen was baptized years later, but his\r\nwife got a divorce from him. He then taught Hebrew at Copenhagen, and\r\neventually, after being persuaded by friends, he became a preacher of\r\nthe Gospel. Testimony is given him that he heartily loved his people,\r\nand defended them against blood accusations. His works are: \"Des\r\nJüdischer Talmud fürnehmster Inhalt und Widerlegung,\" Gislav, 1707,\r\nGera, 1613. A German translation of the eleventh chapter of Tract\r\nSanhedrin. Gerson died on October 22, 1642, only 47 years old, as a\r\npreacher of the Gospel, in poverty. He was pastor of two parishes,\r\nreceiving a stipend of six gulden, and had to work as a farm labourer\r\nfor his living. In the Jewish Encyclopædia it is stated that Gerson was\r\ndrowned at Roelheim, September 25, 1627. Here is a specimen of the\r\ncontradictory statements of historians.\r\n\r\nGERSON, Rev. Marks, was born in Kovno, Poland, in 1879. His father died\r\nwhen he was four, and his mother when he was thirteen. Up to that age he\r\nreceived the usual Jewish education and his elder brother kept him at\r\nschool for another year, but then he had to make a start to earn his own\r\nliving. He worked with relatives for five years, and then came to\r\nLondon, where the \"Hebrew Christian Testimony\" was instrumental in\r\nleading him to Christ. In 1898 he was admitted into the Operative Jewish\r\nConverts' Institution, and in December of the same year was baptized by\r\nthe Rev. G. H. Händler in Christ Church, Stepney. In June, 1899, he was\r\nconfirmed by the Bishop of Stepney, and in 1901 he was accepted by the\r\nChurch Missionary Society for training first at Clapham Common, then at\r\nBlackheath, and subsequently at the College in Islington. On the 18th of\r\nJune, 1905, he was ordained in St. Paul's Cathedral, and since then he\r\nhas laboured with good success in India: being stationed at present in\r\nCalcutta.\r\n\r\nGERSTMAN, W. A., was a missionary of the L.J.S. at Jerusalem in 1837,\r\nand then on account of illness was transferred to Constantinople in\r\n1840.\r\n\r\nGINSBURG, Rev. Dr. Christian David, born at Warsaw, December 25, 1821,\r\nembraced Christianity there in 1846, was missionary of the British\r\nSociety in Liverpool till 1863, when he retired in order to devote\r\nhimself entirely to literary work. Dr. Ginsburg contributed a\r\nconsiderable number of valuable articles on Jewish topics to Kitto's\r\nEncyclopædia, published a book on the Karaites and Essenes, and a full\r\naccount in English of the Kabbalah, its doctrines, development, and\r\nliterature. But he will be especially remembered for his massoretic\r\nstudies, and translation of Elias Levita's \"Massoreth-ha-Massorah\" in\r\n1867, and of Jacob ben Hayim's \"Introduction to the Rabbinic Bible,\"\r\npublished in the same year. He was on the Revision Committee of the Old\r\nTestament. He edited the Massoretic Critical Text of the Hebrew Bible\r\nfor the Trinitarian Bible Society, 1894, and also Salkinson's\r\ntranslation of the New Testament into Hebrew, 1886.\r\n\r\nGINSBURG, Rev. J. B. Crighton, was instructed and baptized by the L.J.S.\r\nmissionary Hausmeister, at Strasburg. After doing good work in England,\r\nand not without results, he laboured for many years in Algeria. Among\r\nhis converts there were Moses Ben Oliel and T. E. Zerbib. He then\r\nlaboured faithfully in Mogador, amidst many difficulties and trials, and\r\nlastly he had the charge of the mission at Constantinople from 1886,\r\ntill the time of his death there, when he entered into the higher\r\nservice of Heaven.\r\n\r\nGOLDBERG, Dr. John Benjamin, was one of a number of rabbis and learned\r\nmen, who were converted to Christianity in Jerusalem in the first half\r\nof the nineteenth century. He was baptized in Christ Church, Jerusalem\r\nby Nicolayson, in 1843. He had consequently to undergo much persecution\r\nand loss of property. In 1847 we find him as a preacher of the Gospel to\r\nhis brethren in Cairo, and then, on account of illness; he was\r\ntransferred to Salonica. In 1851 he was appointed as missionary at\r\nConstantinople, and from there he went, in 1860, to Smyrna. Goldberg was\r\na most spiritually-minded and lovable man. His latter years he spent in\r\nEngland, and contributed to the \"Hebrew Christian Witness,\" in 1874, two\r\nlearned and very valuable and extensive articles on \"The Language of\r\nChrist,\" and on \"The Future Division of the Land of Israel.\"\r\n\r\nGOLDBERG, Johann Peter, missionary to the Jews. We give the following\r\nextracts from his life and work, edited by his son-in-law, the Rev. J.\r\nA. Hausmeister:--\r\n\r\n\"It might appear strange that Goldberg should so soon give up his\r\nacquired profession and become a teacher; but the fact is, that, from\r\nhis earliest years, he showed a disposition more for intellectual\r\nemployment than for business, for the latter he never displayed any\r\ngreat talent. At the same time, he did not conceal his religious, or,\r\nrather, anti-Jewish tendencies, as he was always open and\r\nstraightforward. These were in his case tolerated, because he was\r\nrespected on account of his learning, and in a few years he was duly\r\nappointed as teacher of the whole Jewish community.\r\n\r\n\"Concerning his conversion, he, in his reminiscences, tells the story\r\nthus: 'On New Year's eve, 1803, I and several Jews went, out of\r\ncuriosity, to the Hall, where the congregation of the Moravian brethren\r\nworshipped. Here, I heard, for the first time, of the birth, the\r\ndestiny, the suffering, death, and the resurrection of our Saviour, and\r\nseized by a kind of foreboding feeling, my heart was filled with joy and\r\nhappiness. Deeply touched, I left that sacred house with the resolve to\r\nvisit it often, and the impressions of the love of God to men were so\r\nforcibly within me, that they also accompanied and refreshed me in my\r\nsleep. Yet, alas! this beneficial impression vanished soon, by reason of\r\nthe implanted prejudices against Christianity, and of the unbelief which\r\nhad already taken root in me, even in the Scriptures of the Old\r\nTestament. But since that night I felt, more and more, a disconsolate\r\nemptiness in my heart, though I continued, at a distance, from the way\r\nof life.' We hear here the knockings of God on the door of an erring\r\nheart, which refused to open itself. How often must the gracious God\r\nvisit a man, now with love and then with affliction, before He can gain\r\nadmittance into his soul. But a Jew has still more difficulties to\r\ncontend against; for the prejudices against Christianity, which he\r\nimbibes from his youth, arise from the natural heart as soon as it has\r\ncome under the influence of the truth. He has to contend not only\r\nagainst the enemy of unbelief, but also against the enemy of\r\nsuperstition, which bars his way in every direction. Though Goldberg was\r\nsurrounded by various Christians at Neuwied, and came, sometimes, in\r\ncontact with the Moravian brethren, yet many years passed before he\r\nsubmitted to the Word of God, and found the peace which the world can\r\nneither give nor take away. It is very telling for the character of\r\nGoldberg that he chose Neuwied for his home. With his former principal\r\nat Hamburg, he continued a friendly correspondence, and received from\r\nhim repeated invitations to return to the situation, where every\r\nprospect for his advancement and happiness awaited him. But he was firm,\r\nand felt no matrimonial inclinations for the rich merchant's daughter,\r\nbut rather chose for his partner the daughter of Solomon Rubens, the\r\nJewish butcher at Neuwied. They were married in 1806, and she brought\r\nhim something better than money--a true and loving heart; which helped\r\nhim to carry his burden, and was ready with him to cast that burden upon\r\nthe mighty shoulders of the Saviour, and to participate in his joy and\r\npeace. Nevertheless, many a rivulet flows into the Rhine, and the couple\r\nhad to drink much of the bitter waters of Marah, before they tasted of\r\nthe cup of salvation. I will only mention a few instances:--\r\n\r\n\"When Goldberg established his own home, he resumed his connexion with\r\nhis family, not only by correspondence but by paying them a visit, which\r\nhe had long yearned to do. In the very fruitful year of 1811 he started\r\nupon his journey, in spite of the dissuasion of the Austrian ambassador\r\nat Frankfort, who had told him that he was liable to punishment in his\r\ncountry, because he had failed to present himself for military service.\r\nSafely arrived at Regensburg, the superintendent of the police refused\r\nat first to give a _visé_ to his passport for Austria, as it had not the\r\nsignature of the ambassador, but he and his wife at last prevailed over\r\nthe officer. In Vienna, again, the police told him that he would have to\r\nbe transported home as a transgressor of the law, but through the\r\ninfluence of a banker, a cousin of Goldberg, and by means of a bribe, he\r\nwas permitted to remain some time in Vienna unmolested. On his return\r\njourney to the Rhine he experienced immediate Divine protection, even in\r\na more striking manner. He had made this journey on foot, and came one\r\nday very tired to a village and rested a little in an hotel. Black\r\nclouds covered the sky and announced the approach of a storm, when\r\nGoldberg resumed his march, though against the warning of the hostess,\r\nas he was very anxious to see his wife and children as soon as possible.\r\nAs soon as he entered a thick forest, the rain came down in torrents,\r\naccompanied by thunder and lightning, and the wanderer had to stop.\r\nThere was an open space in the forest with only a few stumps of trees in\r\nit, and he was meditating upon which of the stumps he should sit down.\r\nHe decided for the one which stood on the right. Scarcely had he sat\r\ndown, when the stump on the left was struck by lightning and shivered to\r\npieces. He was thus much impressed with the wonderful protecting care of\r\nthe providence of God.\r\n\r\n\"The Jews have many nice customs and rites as well as beautiful prayers.\r\nWhen the Spirit of God will some day revive this people, then will many\r\na Jewish form and custom, which is now performed like an empty ceremony,\r\nbe exercised in spirit and leave a blessing. One of these customs is,\r\nthat after the service on the Sabbath and on feast days, the children\r\napproach the parents, who lay their hands on them and bless them.[13]\r\nAlso, when a Jew goes on a journey, the members of his family follow\r\nhim and pronounce a blessing. It was so before Goldberg started on his\r\njourney that his mother-in-law laid her hands on his head, blessed him,\r\nand then added: 'Farewell, we shall never see one another again.' Yet\r\nGoldberg could not believe that these parting words would be fulfilled.\r\nWhen on his journey back he spent a night at Regensburg, and awoke early\r\nin the morning, there suddenly appeared to him near his bed, the form of\r\na friendly woman, dressed in white, who looked at him complacently. He\r\nrecognized her as his mother-in-law, looked at his watch, it was four\r\no'clock, and was greatly astonished. He rose up and resumed his journey,\r\nand when he arrived at Frankfort, he met a Jew from Neuwied, of whom he\r\nenquired after his family, and was told by him that they were all well,\r\nand at last that his mother-in-law had died. Now he understood the\r\nmeaning of the apparition. He used often to refer to this event and say:\r\n'You know that I am no believer in ghost stories, yet I have, myself,\r\nexperienced, and am convinced, that spirits can be in communication with\r\none another.' Deeply moved, he returned to his family, and his arrival\r\nwas to them a great comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n[13] This custom is very seldom seen nowadays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We should have thought that all these experiences would have caused\r\nGoldberg to think right earnestly of making his peace with God, but this\r\nwas not yet the case. When a man does not read the Word of God with\r\nprayer, and does not seek the influence of the Holy Spirit, no\r\nconversion can take place in his heart. Goldberg, at this period, had\r\nlost all faith in the Bible. He belonged to a society of so-called\r\nenlightened Jews at Neuwied, who contributed to a periodical entitled\r\n'Measaph.' He, himself, wrote many nice Hebrew articles, with the object\r\nof enlightening his co-religionists, though his own mind was yet\r\nsurrounded by darkness. His Jewish friends and some Christians used to\r\nread novels together, and lived according to the pernicious principles\r\nwhich the frivolous books inculcated. But though he was a member of this\r\ncircle, yet the good hand of the invisible God kept him from falling\r\ninto gross sins, so that all his experiences of Divine help and\r\nprotection contributed, at least, to maintain in him the fear of God. He\r\nused often to speak of this with great thankfulness.\r\n\r\n\"The Lord had also continually given him a cross to bear, in order to\r\nbend his stiff neck. In those times of dreadful wars, Goldberg, on\r\naccount of his knowledge of the Polish and Russian languages, was often\r\nobliged to act as interpreter among the troops of these nations who had\r\ntheir quarters there.\r\n\r\n\"In 1814, he was called one evening, very late, to quiet an uproar that\r\nhad arisen among the Russian soldiers. This accomplished, he returned\r\nhome late in the night, and in the darkness he did not observe a waggon\r\nthat stood in the way, and fell over the shaft and broke his leg; and,\r\nconsequently, was laid up for several weeks.\r\n\r\n\"In November, 1815, a daughter was born to him; another, four years of\r\nage, suddenly died on the same day. His wife, likewise, fell into a\r\ndangerous illness, which lasted twenty-four weeks, and from continued\r\nwatching by her bedside, he became exhausted and extremely dejected. He\r\ndescribed his experience of that time thus:--'Placed in a condition of\r\ntedious misery and all kinds of sorrow, and not having a single\r\nsympathetic soul to comfort me, I became utterly dejected. I could not\r\nthink of God with a feeling heart, and, therefore, suffered\r\nindescribable pangs in body and soul. When once I lay down at midnight,\r\nand placed my miserable condition vividly before me, a feeling of\r\ndespair seized me, and I cried out: \"Lord, how long?\" But immediately\r\nGod set me up by instilling a beam of hope within my soul, that He would\r\nsoon deliver me out of my trouble. This new hope revived me, and I felt\r\npeace; my wife, also, became better that very night and felt a\r\nrefreshing influence. Then I went in a corner, wept and prayed for the\r\nhelp of God in the sense of Ps. xxxii. and xxxviii., and vowed to the\r\nLord to read again His Word with reverence, and to place myself entirely\r\nunder His guidance, and to be no longer so distrustful. From this moment\r\nanother Spirit had the rule over me. Injurious books which had led me to\r\nunbelief were laid aside, and the Bible had a new attraction for me. Now\r\nalso a longing after the promised Redeemer revived in me. In this\r\nmanner, He who searches the hearts, and is near to them who seek Him in\r\nsincerity, prepared me gradually for the time when He, as the good\r\nShepherd, would completely open the door to His fold for me, and\r\ntranslate me out of the darkness into His marvellous light.' So\r\nGoldberg could speak after he had already come to the knowledge of\r\nJesus; but the way in which this was brought about was, in its\r\nbeginning, obscure. He, himself, tells of the first occasion thereto:\r\n\r\n\"'In August, 1817, a learned Jew, who had recently come from London,\r\nwhere he was teacher for a long time, sent for me, and told me, in a\r\ncautioning tone, that a certain gentleman had visited him on that day\r\nand put the astonishing question to him whether there were not some Jews\r\nthere who would be inclined to read the New Testament in the Hebrew\r\nlanguage; in which case he could supply them with it gratis. Then, he\r\nadded, that there is in London a Society for Promoting Christianity\r\namongst the Jews, having agents abroad of whom this gentleman must be\r\none, and, therefore, I should beware of coming in contact with him. But\r\nthis communication effected a different impression upon me to that which\r\nwas intended. The gentleman against whom I was warned was neither a\r\npreacher nor a missionary, but a universally respected merchant, by the\r\nname of Keetman. I had a great desire of becoming acquainted with this\r\ndangerous man, who took so much trouble to visit the Jews and to talk to\r\nthem on religious matters, and as I was not in the habit of visiting\r\npeople without any occasion, this desire increased the more. At last I\r\nventured, one Saturday, to go to Mr. Keetman, and say to him that I had\r\nheard that he had Hebrew books, and if he wished me to copy them I\r\nshould be ready to do so.' In this manner Goldberg became acquainted\r\nwith an earnest and warm friend of Israel, and this acquaintanceship\r\nformed a new chapter in his life, which I cannot better designate than\r\nhis awakening.\"\r\n\r\nGOLDENBERG, D., was born in Piatka, Volhynia, in 1805. His father, Hayim\r\nBaruch, was a learned rabbi, and consulted by others on difficult\r\nrabbinic questions. His grandfather was a Zadik or wonder rabbi, and\r\nused to talk to him about the speedy coming of the Messiah. At the age\r\nof 10 his parents found him a bride, and at the age of 17 he was\r\nmarried, and went to live with his father-in-law in Tschidoroff. Passing\r\nthrough a severe illness, he began to think earnestly about the state of\r\nhis soul before God. He felt the burden of his sins and frequently\r\nprayed for the advent of the Redeemer. His friends advised him to divert\r\nhis mind by more diligent study of the Talmud, but he remained restless.\r\nAt this time, in 1821, cholera visited the place, and he dreaded to die.\r\nPassing by just then a Christian school, he heard the children pronounce\r\nthe ineffable name of Jehovah, which attracted his attention, so he\r\nbought a catechism to see what the Christian doctrine was, but he laid\r\nit aside. Then he received a packet of tracts and a New Testament from\r\nMyerson, who got them from the L.J.S. missionary Moritz when he visited\r\nBerditscheff. He was not long after convinced of the truth of the\r\nGospel, visited Moritz, and with his friend went to Berlin, where he was\r\ninstructed and baptized by Pastor Schultz (\"Jewish Intelligence,\" 1824).\r\nHis father came to Berlin and tried to win him back to Judaism, but\r\nwhen he found that he was thoroughly in earnest and happy in his faith,\r\nhe left him in peace in a friendly manner. Goldenberg went then to\r\nLondon, and was thence sent to Poland, to witness for Christ among his\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\nGOLDINGER, Tobias W., was a L.J.S. missionary in Poland in the forties\r\nof the nineteenth century, where he laboured successfully. He was, under\r\nGod, the means of the conversion of a number of Jews, one of whom may be\r\nnamed here. Goldinger had once given the \"Life of Friedrich Augusti\" to\r\nthe son of Rabbi L. Altschiller, of Marronopol, and this led to his\r\neventual conversion. The case attracted at the time much public\r\nattention, as the young man passed through a great struggle with his\r\nfamily, but came out triumphant. Goldinger laboured latterly at Breslau,\r\nwhere the writer had the privilege of making his acquaintance at the end\r\nof 1872, and was very much impressed by his gentle Christian spirit. It\r\nis a pity that Pastor de le Roi, who was at that time his colleague, did\r\nnot give us more information about him. It is probably because\r\nGoldinger, like many other Jewish converts, out of modesty was reluctant\r\nto publish to the world his personal history.\r\n\r\nGOLDSMID, Frederick, is known to have laboured as a successful\r\nmissionary in India.\r\n\r\nGOLDSTERN, Israel, a native of Lemberg, Galicia, educated in strict\r\northodoxy. Already in his early manhood he became President of a Talmud\r\nUnion. Failing in health, he journeyed to the Bath Heines, and on his\r\nway met a Christian merchant who, in a conversation, convinced him that\r\nthe Talmud has no Divine authority. This shook his faith in modern\r\nJudaism. For two years he had no peace of mind. His widowed mother, in\r\norder to divert his attention, got him married. But it did not last long\r\nbefore he came into collision with his family on account of his\r\nreligious views, so he left for Constantinople, whither his wife\r\nfollowed him. Eventually he was baptized by Pastor Bonnet, in Cologne,\r\nin 1875, while his wife still hesitated to take the decisive step. His\r\nfather-in-law, when he found out the place of their residence, brought a\r\nsuit against him for embezzling his property, because before he left\r\nLemberg he had pawned his wife's ornaments, which he himself had given\r\nher. However, his friends at Cologne, paid the whole sum. He afterwards\r\nstudied theology at Barmen, and became missionary of the Westphalian\r\nRhenish (now called West German) Society, under which he has been\r\nlabouring with much blessing upon his efforts ever since. He succeeded\r\nthe writer at Frankfort-on-the-Maine.\r\n\r\nGOTTFRIED, Johann Adam (Nathan), born at Altona in 1726, died in 1773.\r\nAfter losing his father in his youth, his mother sent him to an uncle,\r\nwho was a diamond cutter in London, to learn the trade. There he somehow\r\nheard the name of Jesus and got to love it. He soon returned, and his\r\nmother went with him to another relation, Rabbi Koppel Fränkel, at\r\nFürth, under whose auspices he made rapid progress in Jewish learning,\r\nso that at the age of 17 he was asked to take charge of a school in the\r\ncountry. Two years before, two rabbis predicted that he would yet become\r\na Meshummad. The Jews in former days used sometimes to call a sharp boy\r\nMeshummad or ganov (thief). At the age of 21 he passed by an evangelical\r\nchurch at Sulzberg, and listened to the worship there, and was solemnly\r\nmoved. Henceforth he studied the Scriptures, especially Isaiah liii., as\r\nhe had heard that Christians refer to it. The result was that he made a\r\npublic confession of his faith, and was baptized by Pastor Pfeiffer, at\r\nErlangen, in 1750. He studied theology, but was too humble and timid to\r\nascend the pulpit. So he maintained himself by teaching Hebrew, Latin,\r\nGreek, and French, and by writing. One of his works is entitled: \"Der\r\ntroslose Jude in der letzten Todesstunde.\" Another is, \"Der bussfertige\r\nSünder Schriftgemässe Vorstellung und freundliche ermahnung an\r\nsämmtliche proselyten der jetzigen Zeit. Vernünftiger Unterricht über\r\ndie natürliche Religion und desen Vornehmste Streitigkeiten und über die\r\nChristliche Religion.\"\r\n\r\nGOTTFRIED, Philip Selig, born in 1722 in a little town near Halle. When\r\nten years old his mother died, and the Jewish authorities would not\r\nallow her to be buried there, because they had heard a rumour that \"she\r\nhad in her dying hour committed her soul into the hands of Jesus Christ\r\nthe Saviour of the world.\" His father had to take her at night to Halle\r\nfor burial. Philip was then sent to a school at Fürth, where he studied\r\nthe Talmud diligently. He narrates in his autobiography, 3 volumes,\r\nLeipzig, 1755: \"I can, without boasting, say that when I was 13 years\r\nold I could repeat by heart 500 pages of the Talmud without mistake, and\r\ndeliver a Derashah (sermon) on a solemn occasion.\" His father then got a\r\ntheological student to instruct him in Latin and German, but made it a\r\ncondition that he should not mention the subject of religion to the boy.\r\nHowever, the teacher and his clever, inquisitive, pupil soon had\r\ndisputations together. It happened one day that a Jewish girl passed by\r\ntheir house, dressed in black and accompanied by a number of Christians\r\nleading her to church to be baptized. A neighbour asked Gottfried\r\nwhether he liked the procession, and his reply was that \"it looks like\r\nleading a criminal to the place of execution.\" \"Quite right,\" said the\r\nother, \"the girl is led as a sinner to Jesus to have her sins washed\r\naway by the blood which He shed on the cross.\" Gottfried continued his\r\ndisputes about Christianity with his teacher, who sometimes was\r\nperplexed in not knowing how to answer his objections. He brought a\r\nHebrew scholar to him and they read Isaiah liii. together, Gottfried\r\nquoting the rabbinical interpretations of it, and the other refuting\r\nthem. After the debate was over, Gottfried earnestly reflected upon the\r\nsubject, and was convinced that the Christians are right. He then bought\r\na New Testament for 12 groschen, and studied it critically. After a long\r\ninward struggle and earnest prayer, he by the aid of the Holy Spirit\r\ntriumphed over his intense prejudices, and applied to a pastor for\r\nChristian instruction. Before his baptism, in 1738, he had to answer 400\r\nquestions in his examination. Two sisters followed his example. The\r\nfather disinherited them all. The convert Friedrich Augusti was then\r\nvery kind to him. In 1788 he published a Kabbalistic work entitled\r\n\"Sepher Shimush Tehillim.\" His chief work was his weekly paper, \"Der\r\nJude,\" in 9 volumes, Leipzig, 1767-1771.\r\n\r\nGOTTHEIL, Rev. Paul Eduard, brother of Rabbi Gustav Gottheil, of the\r\nTemple Emmanuel, New York, born at Franstadt (Germany), April 5, 1818,\r\ndied at Stuttgart in 1893. He was one of the most distinguished converts\r\nand missionaries in the nineteenth century. He studied theology at Basel\r\nand then entered the service of the British Society in 1848, in which he\r\ncontinued all his life. He was for many years minister of the English\r\nChurch at Canstadt, and then minister of the Diakonessenhaus at\r\nStuttgart. In both offices he was very successful. Some of those he\r\nbaptized at Nuremberg, Canstadt and Stuttgart, have become ministers of\r\nthe Gospel or missionaries to the Jews, like Bahri and Löwen, who both\r\nlaboured at Vienna. He published \"Blätter für die Evangelische Mission\r\nunter Israel,\" 1850-1858; \"Der Messias Israel's Hoffnung und aller\r\nVölker Verlangen,\" 1863 (translated into English); \"Mishan Lehem,\r\nLebensbrot für Gottes Volk aus Gotteswort\" (Hebrew and German), 1871,\r\nYiddish and German 1873; \"Die Arbeit an den Einzelnen,\" in \"Nathaniel,\"\r\n1891, No. 6; an extensive Memoir of Professor Franz Delitzsch in \"The\r\nEverlasting Nation,\" 1890.\r\n\r\nGOTTLIEB, K. J., was a native of Sadagora (Bukovina, Austria), a town\r\nwhich has been the residence of several generations of wonder-working\r\nrabbis for about a hundred years, and has become the Mecca of the\r\nChassidim. Naturally he was brought up in strict orthodoxy. An elder\r\nbrother of his, however, managed to learn German and to study medicine,\r\nand settle as a practitioner in Pesth. At the age of 16 Gottlieb visited\r\nhis brother, in whose house he found a Hebrew Bible with a German\r\ntranslation, which he diligently read, and his brother explained to him\r\ndifficult passages, directing his special attention to Messianic\r\nprophecies without at once disclosing his own views. This excited his\r\ninterest, and he began to enquire into the subject. He then happened to\r\nmeet with a Jewish tract, entitled \"Source of Salvation,\" in which the\r\nyear 1864 was assigned for the advent of the Messiah, but in which the\r\nMessiahship of Jesus was distinctly repudiated. This caused him to ask\r\nhis brother if he could throw light on the subject, and to his surprise\r\nhe found that his brother had long been a baptized Christian, and he\r\nresolved to become one likewise if he should by instruction be\r\nconvinced. A place was then found for him as Hebrew teacher in the\r\nScotch Mission school, and he received Christian instruction from Pastor\r\nKönig and Pastor Wagner. However, it was found advisable to send him to\r\nPrague, where, after receiving further instruction from Mr. Schönberger,\r\nhe was baptized by him in 1876. Gottlieb studied afterwards at Basel,\r\nand for a time was a missionary of the Free Church of Scotland, but most\r\nof his missionary career was in the service of the Berlin Society, in\r\nBerlin, Jassy, Chernowitz, near his home, and lastly in Stanislau. In\r\nall these places he was much beloved for his excellent qualities and\r\ntrue Christian piety. He died comparatively young, and \"the remembrance\r\nof his name is for a blessing.\"\r\n\r\nGREEN, Rev. Samuel J., was baptized in 1859 by the Rev. John Wilkinson,\r\nthe founder of the Mildmay Mission to the Jews. He went to Australia and\r\npreached the Gospel to the Jews at Bathurst, where he also built a\r\nchurch in 1879.\r\n\r\nGURLAND, Rev. Rudolf Hermann, born in Wilna, 1836, of a family which\r\nwere Spanish Gentile Christians, who became Jews and had fled from the\r\nInquisition at the beginning of the eighteenth century into Russia. The\r\nfather was a strictly orthodox and bigoted Jew, and sent his son to\r\nvarious yeshivas (rabbinical colleges), so that in 1857 he received the\r\ntitle of Doctor, and was called to be the President of the Seminary at\r\nBerditscheff, where he remained till 1860. He tried at first to\r\nintroduce reform in the Synagogue, and wrote a work under the title \"Das\r\nJudenthum und die Reformversuche des 17 und 18 Jahrhundert\" (only in\r\nM.S.), but won no sympathy for his attempt. Meeting a traveller in 1862,\r\nhe received from him a Hebrew New Testament, and at the same time\r\nlearned from him about Pastor Faltin's missionary activity at\r\nKischineff. He went there and became rabbi of a congregation. One day he\r\ncame to Faltin and asked him if he could get him pupils for caligraphy\r\nand drawing, and showed him some specimens of his work. Faltin tried to\r\ndo so but failed, and then proposed that they should read the Hebrew\r\nBible together. Gurland agreed, but made it a condition that the main\r\nissue between Judaism and Christianity should not be introduced. Some\r\ntime passed in reading book after book of the Old Testament, and Gurland\r\ngave no sign of any change in him. They were reading Isaiah liii. for\r\nthe second time. When Faltin finished, Gurland said, \"Read it over\r\nagain,\" but he could not wait till he had done so, because he was\r\ninwardly moved, and went home in silence. Faltin then fell on his knees\r\nand earnestly prayed that God might open the eyes of the rabbi to see\r\nChrist in all His glory. The next time Gurland came, he asked Faltin to\r\nread again the same chapter; and then he could no longer resist the\r\nstriving of the spirit within his heart, and exclaimed, \"I do not know\r\nwhat it is, I now find much in the Bible which I have not found before,\r\nalthough I know it by heart. The chapter must refer to your Jesus, and I\r\nmust soon acknowledge that He is the promised Messiah.\" The result of\r\nthis meeting was, that the rabbi became the pupil of the pastor,\r\nreceiving frequent instruction from him in the doctrines of the Gospel.\r\nBut this frequent intercourse between them could not fail to be observed\r\nby the Jews, yet they at first had not the slightest suspicion of the\r\nrabbi's intention, but on the contrary thought that Faltin was inclined\r\nto embrace Judaism. In fact, one of them told this to one of his\r\ncongregation. This man came to the pastor and questioned him about it,\r\nand was assured by him that he would never deny his Saviour, but it was\r\npossible that Gurland might embrace Christianity. Several rabbis came\r\nnow to Gurland and, like the Protestant, asked him whether Faltin wished\r\nto become a Ger (proselyte) to Judaism. This brought the matter to a\r\nclimax, and he confessed before them all that Jesus was the Messiah and\r\nproved his convictions from the Bible. They cried, \"You have a false\r\nBible,\" but he answered, \"Compare it with your own and see whether it is\r\nfalse.\" What he had to suffer afterwards, need not here be described. He\r\nand his wife were baptized on Easter Sunday, 1864, before a large\r\ncongregation of Christians and Jews. He then studied theology in Berlin,\r\nreturned to Kischineff and became assistant pastor to Faltin, when many\r\nJewish converts were the result of their labours. Gurland was later\r\nchief pastor at Mitau, working at the same time among the Jews. His\r\nlatter years were devoted to spreading the New Testament in Wilna,\r\nOdessa and the Baltic provinces, under the auspices of the Mildmay\r\nMission to the Jews. Professor Delitzsch called him \"A noble soul.\"\r\n\r\nGUTENHAUER, Gutschalk Eduard, after having been won for Christ and\r\nbaptized by the Rev. W. Ayerst in Berlin in 1836, studied philosophy and\r\nbecame Professor at the University of Breslau in 1841. There he\r\npublished a work about Leibnitz, and another about Lessing, 1842, 1852.\r\n\r\nHALBMILLION, Jacob, a convert of the L.J.S. at Jerusalem, was afterwards\r\nhouse-father of the Wanderers' Home in London, under Dr. Stern, and then\r\none of the first missionaries of the Mildmay Mission, zealously\r\nlabouring in London and then in North Africa. He died in Morocco in\r\n1888.\r\n\r\nHAMBURGER, a convert in Holland, died in 1872. Da Costa delivered an\r\noration at his funeral.\r\n\r\nHÄNDLER, Rev. H. G., born in Warsaw in the thirties of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. In his youth he became distinguished for his Talmudical\r\nlearning, so that the epithet Harif or Nilley (expert) was applied to\r\nhim at that time. Gifted with a good memory, he easily acquired a\r\nknowledge of German, Polish, Latin, and Greek, and he compiled a\r\ncollection of noble sayings in the Greek Classics. When quite a young\r\nman he came to London, and was converted to Christianity under the\r\nministry of Dr. McCaul, Reichardt, and others, in Palestine Place. After\r\nfour years at the Operative Jewish Converts' Institution he studied in\r\nthe L.J.S. Hebrew College, and then laboured as a missionary in Breslau,\r\nand in Tunis. In 1873 he opened a school for Jewish children (mostly\r\ngirls) at Cracow, and carried it on successfully for about ten years. In\r\n1883, he was transferred to Vienna, where he had many tokens of Divine\r\nblessing upon his efforts. One of his converts has for many years been a\r\nChaplain in India, and is still there. Händler assisted Professor\r\nDelitzsch in his translation of the New Testament into Hebrew, and\r\nfurnished the abbreviations to Professor Dalman's Chaldaic Dictionary,\r\nrevised Biesenthal's rabbinic \"Commentar der Romans,\" wrote several\r\ntracts, and revised the Judæo-German translation of the Bible for the\r\nTrinitarian Bible Society.\r\n\r\nHARZUGE, Johannes, brought out a German translation of the New Testament\r\nin Hebrew characters in 1550. Some Hebrew words were retained in this\r\ntranslation for the purpose of making it more intelligible to the Jewish\r\nreaders at that time. A specimen of this translation will be found in\r\nWolff, (Bibliotheca Hebraica iv. 205).\r\n\r\nHAUSMEISTER, Rev. Jacob August, was born in Stuttgart, 1806. His father\r\nwas a quiet man, and his mother was rather inclined towards\r\nChristianity, and often ejaculated, \"O that my son Jacob might become a\r\nChristian. We Jews cannot keep the commandments and are therefore\r\nwithout consolation, whilst Christians are saved by grace.\" Hausmeister\r\nwas left an orphan when still young. Left without a guardian, he was\r\ninclined to live a worldly life. Meeting a Christian companion, he\r\nfollowed him to Church, and listened to the fervent preacher Hofacker.\r\nHis uncle, a watchmaker, to whom he was apprenticed, heard of it and was\r\nvery angry with him, but he persevered in going to Church. Hausmeister\r\nwas baptized by Dekan Heswig in Esslingen in 1825. He then studied at\r\nBasel, and afterwards in the Hebrew College, Palestine Place. In 1832 he\r\nwas appointed missionary by the L.J.S., at Strasburg, where he laboured\r\nzealously till the end. Three scores of converts were the fruit of his\r\nlabours. Hausmeister did also much literary work. He wrote the tract (1)\r\n\"Wörte der Liebe an meine Brüder nach dem Fleisch\"; (2) \"Gespräch zweier\r\njüdischen Freunde über das Wort Gottes\"; (3) \"Winke und Mittheilungen\r\nüber die Mission unter Israel\"; (4) \"Ueber den Unterricht der\r\nProselyten, Evangelische Mission unter Israel\"; also biographies of\r\nBörling and of Goldberg, his near relatives.\r\n\r\nHEFTER, Rev. Albert David, born in Dombrowa, Galicia, in 1819. His\r\nfather was a well-to-do jeweller. His mother had made a vow that he\r\nshould become a rabbi. When he was only four years of age he was\r\ninstructed by a Zadik, or wonder working rabbi. Among the books of his\r\nfather he found a New Testament, and questioned him as to its contents,\r\nbut it was snatched away. Whilst he was in the Yeshiva, his parents\r\ndied, and he went to Tarnopol, to live with a married sister, where he\r\npursued his studies, but took offence at the philosophical opinions\r\nwhich some of his fellow students entertained. One of them offered to\r\nteach him Science, and he consented with a view of bringing his friend\r\nback to Talmudism. After a time he came to Cracow, where he got\r\nacquainted with the L.J.S. missionary Hoff, who gave him to read \"The\r\nConfession of a Proselyte,\" by Fränkel, and also the New Testament. This\r\nbrought him to a knowledge of the Saviour. But it was not thought safe\r\nto baptize him in Galicia, so he was sent to Bellson, in Berlin, who\r\nbaptized him in 1846. Hefter was one of a band of noble and most learned\r\nmissionaries of the L.J.S. in the nineteenth century. He was stationed\r\neight years in Jerusalem, then a short time in Pesth, and then in Memel\r\nand Posen, and, lastly, for many years in Frankfort. One of his converts\r\nthere is the very able and successful missionary, Rev. M. Kameras, of\r\nthe British Society, at Vienna. A blind Jew who was baptized by Hefter,\r\ndied on Christmas Day, 1881, and his last words were, \"I shall see Him.\"\r\n\r\nHEILBRONNER, Johannes Christlieb (Moses Prager), was baptized in\r\nHeilbronn in 1709, his wife in Pirma in 1716. He taught Hebrew and\r\nTalmud in various universities. He published a tract on Isaiah liii.,\r\nTübingen, 1710; \"Klare Beweisthümer über Jesum Christum, dass Er der\r\nwahre Messias und Sohn Gottes ist, aus dem Alten Testamente, der\r\nRabbinen und Kabbalisten Schriften, nachgewiesen mit einem Anhang, was\r\nfür einen Messias die Juden erwarten,\" Dresden, 1715; \"Eine Widerlegung\r\nder Einwürfe der Juden gegen die Geschlechtsregister Christi, besonders\r\nwider die Schrift Chizzuk Emunah gerichtet,\" Hamburg, 1718.\r\n\r\nHEINERSDORF, Julius Christian, born in Breslau in 1805. When a little\r\nboy at school he had to suffer much persecution from the Christian boys,\r\nand he became a bitter enemy of Christianity, but in riper age he got to\r\nknow and esteem true Christians, who read the Old and New Testaments\r\nwith him, and through their influence he was baptized in 1826. He then\r\nstudied theology, and became a pastor, and later superintendent (equal\r\nto a Bishop or Moderator) near Königsberg. He was a gifted and pious\r\nman, and his ministry was blessed.\r\n\r\nHELIC, Lucas, was a member of the Moravian brethren in 1570, when, owing\r\nto his excellent Hebrew scholarship, he was elected as co-translator of\r\nthe Kalitzir Bible. He received Moravian ordination, and preached the\r\nGospel till 1858; also printed his sermons for circulation.\r\n\r\nHELLMUTH, Isaac. The fact that the subject of this sketch was one of the\r\nthree Hebrew Christian Bishops of the last century--Bishops Alexander\r\nand Schereschewsky being the other two--invests his life and memory with\r\na special interest for all workers for Israel.\r\n\r\nWhilst Alexander spent his life in actively seeking \"the lost sheep of\r\nthe house of Israel\" in various lands of their dispersion, and\r\nSchereschewsky the \"other sheep\" of the Redeemer's fold in the heathen\r\nEmpire of China, Bishop Hellmuth's career was mainly associated with the\r\npromotion of the spiritual and intellectual interests of the sons and\r\ndaughters of the Greater Britain beyond the seas.\r\n\r\nIsaac Hellmuth was born at Warsaw, Poland, on December 14th, 1820, and\r\nwas from early childhood instructed and trained \"according to the\r\nperfect manner of the law of his fathers,\" in Rabbinical schools of high\r\nrepute, where he acquired great proficiency in Biblical and Talmudical\r\nlearning. His parents gave him a thorough religious and secular\r\neducation. He was sent at the age of sixteen to the University of\r\nBreslau, where he continued with success his studies in classical and\r\nOriental literature. At that time Dr. S. Neumann, a Hebrew Christian,\r\nand a missionary of the London Society for Promoting Christianity\r\namongst the Jews, was stationed at Breslau. Being also a professor at\r\nthat University, he was more especially brought into contact with\r\nlearned Jews and students, over whom he exercised great influence. It\r\nwas through him that young Hellmuth had his attention drawn to\r\nChristianity. In 1841 he came to England, and was baptized in All\r\nSaints' Church, Liverpool, by the Rev. H. S. Joseph, a missionary of\r\nthe same Society. Isaac had two brothers. When he was baptized his\r\nfather cut him out of his will altogether. But, on his father's death,\r\nhis two brothers, although they themselves remained Jews, generously\r\nrestored to their Christian brother his share of their father's\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining some three years in England, studying English theology\r\nunder Hugh McNeile, Haldane Stewart and others, Hellmuth left for Canada\r\nin 1844, taking with him commendatory letters from many eminent\r\nclergymen, including one from Dr. Sumner, afterwards Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury. Hellmuth's ministerial life was principally spent in Canada,\r\nwhere he had a distinguished career, for many particulars of which we\r\nare indebted to \"Bishops of the Day,\" which particulars were most likely\r\nfurnished by himself. Hellmuth was ordained both deacon and priest in\r\n1846 by Dr. Mountain, Bishop of Quebec. He received the Lambeth degree\r\nof D.D. in 1853, and the honorary degrees of D.C.L. from Trinity\r\nCollege, Toronto, and D.D. from the University of Lennoxville in 1854.\r\nHe spent eight years as rector of Sherbrooke, Quebec, and as professor\r\nof Hebrew and Rabbinical Literature at Bishop's College, Lennoxville, of\r\nwhich institution he was also vice-principal. His views were strongly\r\nEvangelical. He resigned his posts in Quebec on being made general\r\nsuperintendent of the Colonial and Continental Church Society in British\r\nNorth America. The Bishop of Huron, Dr. Cronyn, had been much troubled\r\nabout Provost Whitaker, of Trinity College, Toronto, whose teaching he\r\nconsidered unsound, although the other Bishops of the province, on being\r\nreferred to, upheld it. The Bishop, not satisfied, decided to establish\r\nat London, Ontario, a college more under his own control. This resulted\r\nin the formation and partial endowment of Huron College, which was\r\nopened in 1863 under the presidency of Dr. Hellmuth, who was also made\r\narchdeacon of Huron. His educational enthusiasm led him to start a\r\ncollege for boys, called Hellmuth Boys' College. Recalling his efforts\r\nin its behalf, he said: \"Twice I visited England to plead its cause, and\r\nthrough the liberal gifts of friends in the mother land, the grounds and\r\nbuildings for the Divinity College were secured. Amongst the benefactors\r\nof this College, one valued friend, the Rev. Alfred Peache, endowed the\r\nDivinity chair with the munificent sum of £5,000 sterling.\r\n\r\n\"Huron College faithfully fulfilled its trust and served its designed\r\nend. Over one hundred devoted ministers of Christ's Gospel have been\r\ntrained within its walls, the majority of whom are labouring with\r\nsuccess in our own Diocese, while the remainder have been called to\r\noccupy prominent positions in various other parts of our Dominion.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1867 Dr. Hellmuth was made rector of St. Paul's Cathedral and Dean of\r\nHuron. He used his large private means unsparingly in advancing the\r\ncause of higher education. In 1869 he launched the Hellmuth Ladies'\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nThe venerable Canon Christopher, rector of St. Aldate's Church, Oxford,\r\nthus alludes to this institution:--\"He found that Canadian Protestants\r\nwere sending their daughters to convent schools, because they did not\r\nknow of any good Protestant ladies' school. He established an excellent\r\nschool for young ladies near his own house. I addressed nearly a hundred\r\nyoung ladies in this school in 1872. Some of these had to travel twelve\r\ndays and nights from their homes to their school, in the absence of a\r\nrailway from British Columbia.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Hellmuth was chosen on July 19, 1871, by a large majority of the\r\ndiocesan synod to be Bishop Coadjutor of Huron, with the title of Bishop\r\nof Norfolk and the right of succession. Dr. Cronyn died in the following\r\nSeptember, and Dr. Hellmuth became Bishop of Huron. He had been\r\nconsecrated in St. Paul's Cathedral, London, Ontario, on August 24,\r\n1871. In 1877 the Bishop formed a scheme for a Western University in\r\nconnexion with Huron College, subscribing no less than 10,000 dollars\r\ntowards it. In the following year he attended the Lambeth Conference,\r\nand took confirmations for the Bishop of London in Norway, Sweden, and\r\nDenmark. He came to England again, in 1880, to obtain funds for the\r\nWestern University, which was opened on October 5, 1881, with a medical\r\nfaculty in connexion with it. By 1881 the Bishop's exertions had proved\r\nso successful that the S.P.G. aid was no longer required, and the\r\ndiocese could rely on its own resources.\r\n\r\nDuring the Bishop's episcopate, which lasted from 1871 to 1883, great\r\nprogress was made in every department of diocesan work. The number of\r\nlivings increased from 34 to 65; the number of churches from 149 to 207;\r\nand the clergy from 92 to 135. The Sunday schools rose from 110 to 166;\r\nand the communicants from 4,390 to 8,910. Dr. Langtrey, in his \"Colonial\r\nChurch Histories,\"[14] says that the Bishop \"devoted himself with great\r\nearnestness to his work, and soon became very popular throughout the\r\ncountry.\" The Rev. Dr. Hurst, a resident of twenty years in Huron, thus\r\nreferred to the Bishop's labours:--\"I can speak from personal knowledge\r\nof his liberality, zeal, and self-denying efforts to make his diocese an\r\nactive mission field, and a model for higher Christian education--much\r\nat his own personal expense--in both of which God greatly blessed his\r\ninstrumentality. His indefatigable and successful labours have been\r\nacknowledged by all parties in the Church.\"[15]\r\n\r\n\r\n[14] Published by the S.P.C.K. in 1892. (See p. 111.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[15] \"The Greater Britain Messenger,\" C. and C.C. Society, May, 1896, p.\r\n113.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bishop resigned the see of Huron in 1883 under somewhat peculiar\r\ncircumstances. The Bishop of Ripon (Dr. Bickersteth) desired to have Dr.\r\nHellmuth appointed his Suffragan under the Act of Henry VIII. Dr.\r\nHellmuth, being informed that his title was to be Bishop of Hull, and\r\nthat the letters patent could not be executed till he had resigned the\r\nsee of Huron, formally resigned that see on March 29, 1883.\r\n\r\nIn his last charge, delivered before the Synod of the Diocese, the\r\nBishop's broad and loving sympathies found vent in the following\r\nexpressions:--\"I am fully persuaded, as I said on a former occasion,\r\nthat the glory of the Church is her assimilation to Christ. And never\r\nwill her usefulness and her splendour reach their meridian until the\r\nlove of a common Saviour shall bind together every heart and unite every\r\nhand. Envy, jealousy, evil surmisings and uncharitableness can only tend\r\nto weaken and scatter the resources of the Church and palsy her\r\nexertions; but, when through the abundant outpouring of the Holy Spirit,\r\narm shall be linked to arm, and heart to heart, and prayer to\r\nprayer,--when to love and serve Christ, and to anticipate heaven, and to\r\nsave immortal souls,--when these shall be the grand and all absorbing\r\nterms of Christian communion,--oh, then, what a firm and powerful\r\nphalanx shall go forth from the Church of the living God against the\r\npowers of darkness and the enemies of men! For this ONENESS of aim I\r\nwould again repeat, Pray, strive and labour.\"\r\n\r\nThe news of the Bishop's resignation was received with great regret\r\nthroughout the Dominion, and a service of plate was presented to him\r\nwith an address from the standing committee of the diocese.\r\n\r\nOn March 21, 1883, the Bishop of Ripon issued a Pastoral to his diocese,\r\nin which he formally announced the Royal assent to the appointment of\r\nDr. Hellmuth as Bishop Suffragan of Hull. In the following May, nearly\r\ntwo months after Dr. Hellmuth's resignation of the see of Huron, the law\r\nofficers of the Crown discovered that the Act of Henry VIII. did not\r\napply to any one already in Episcopal orders, and that therefore Dr.\r\nHellmuth could not become Bishop Suffragan of Hull. Bishop Hellmuth, who\r\nwas thus placed in an extremely anomalous position, appealed to the then\r\nGovernor-General of Canada, Lord Lorne (the present Duke of Argyll), who\r\nmade representations to Mr. Gladstone, at that time the Prime Minister.\r\nIn reply, Mr. Gladstone pointed out that the Bishop of Ripon still\r\nintended to avail himself of Dr. Hellmuth's services as his Assistant\r\nBishop or Bishop Coadjutor. Bishop Hellmuth then took up his work in the\r\ndiocese of Ripon as Assistant Bishop, although the position was\r\nobviously very different from what he had been led to expect when he\r\nresigned the see of Huron. With the consent of Bishop Bickersteth,\r\nfurther representations were made to Mr. Gladstone, who replied\r\nexpressing regret for the error which had been committed. By the death\r\nof Bishop Bickersteth, in 1884, Dr. Hellmuth's position became still\r\nmore trying, for his commission as Bishop Coadjutor ceased, and he made\r\nanother appeal to Mr. Gladstone for some suitable preferment, but\r\nwithout success. He was rector and rural dean of Bridlington from 1885\r\nto 1891, and perpetual curate of Bessingby from 1888 to 1891. In the\r\nlatter year the Colonial and Continental Church Society gave him the\r\nchaplaincy of Holy Trinity, Pau, which he held for six years. He was\r\nsubsequently rector of Compton-Pauncefoot, Somerset, from 1897 to 1899,\r\nwhen he retired owing to failing health. He passed away within two\r\nyears, on May 28, 1901, at the advanced age of eighty-one.\r\n\r\nBishop Hellmuth was the author of \"The Biblical Thesaurus\" (1884), a\r\nliteral translation and critical analysis of every word in the original\r\nlanguages of the Old Testament, with explanatory notes and appendices;\r\nand \"The Divine Dispensation,\" a critical commentary on the Hebrew\r\nScriptures. Amongst his minor contributions to literature may be\r\nmentioned two articles in \"The Everlasting Nation\"; one on \"The\r\nAuthenticity and Genuineness of the Pentateuch,\" (1867) and the other on\r\n\"The Spirit of Prophecy,\" a luminous paper on the allusions in the Old\r\nTestament to the Messiah of his race.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop married, first, Catherine, daughter of the late General\r\nThomas Evans, C.B., who died in 1884, and secondly, in 1886, Mary\r\nLouisa, second daughter of Admiral the Hon. Arthur Duncombe, son of the\r\nfirst Baron Feversham, and widow of the Hon. Ashley Carr Glyn, son of\r\nthe first Baron Wolverton.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop, as was natural, ever evinced hearty and unbounded interest\r\nin the spiritual welfare of his brethren according to the flesh, and on\r\nmany occasions advocated, from pulpit and platform, their claims to the\r\nGospel. In the work of the London Jews' Society he was especially\r\ninterested. Towards the end of his life he frequently presided over the\r\nmeetings of its Committee, amongst whom he was ever a _persona grata_.\r\nHis solid learning, acquaintance with the languages and modes of thought\r\nof his own people, sound common sense, wise and prudent counsels, as\r\nwell as his urbanity and courtesy, made him an ideal chairman. He had\r\nunlimited sympathy with those engaged in what he regarded as a great\r\nand important work, for he could enter fully into its arduous character\r\nand numerous difficulties. Many a time did he pay a friendly visit to\r\nthe Society's House,--a delightful interlude in official routine--to\r\nencourage and to sympathize; on one occasion narrating the thrilling\r\nstory of how, in early youth, he had found Him whom his soul loved. The\r\nBishop's sterling qualities of heart and mind, his confiding nature and\r\nbuoyant temperament, and his bright and happy face, always infused\r\nsunshine wherever he went.\r\n\r\nOne who knew him writes:--\"We cannot forego one personal word in\r\ngrateful appreciation and loving remembrance of the charming personality\r\nof one, whom, during the latter period of his long and honoured life, we\r\nwere privileged to call our friend. To know him was indeed to love him\r\nas well as to honour and esteem. His sweet and gentle nature, his\r\namiable disposition, his beautiful character, his fatherly attitude, and\r\nhis unfailing tenderness and sympathy, have indelibly associated him in\r\nour mind with the beloved disciple St. John, whose last words would have\r\nbeen natural indeed upon his lips, 'Little children, love one another.'\"\r\n\r\nHEYMAN, Heinrich Wilhelm David, son of a shochet (slaughterer) in poor\r\ncircumstances. When he was only ten years old, he was obliged to give\r\nlessons to peasant boys in order to help his father. He was fond of\r\nreading, and read Lessing's and Mendelssohn's works, and this caused him\r\nto get new ideas of the world, and to keep aloof from the Talmud. Coming\r\nin contact later on with Dr. Heinrich Ditmar, the author of a universal\r\nhistory, he learned from him to know the Gospel, and he and his wife and\r\nthree children were baptized in 1833. Then his mother and wife refused\r\nto have anything to do with him. Then a son and daughter got very ill,\r\nand he was tempted with the thought that he was punished for his\r\napostasy, yet he persevered in prayer, and could triumphantly exclaim in\r\nthe midst of his troubles, \"Lord Jesus, Thou art still my Lord and my\r\nSaviour.\" At last, in 1844, he was called by the friends of Israel in\r\nBasel, to be the principal of the house for proselytes in that city,\r\nwhich office he held faithfully, with great ability and usefulness in\r\nmany directions, till his death in 1868. One of his sons became pastor\r\nat Altbayern, and the other, Frederick, who was formerly pastor in the\r\nPfalz, succeeded him as principal and agent of the Basel Mission to the\r\nJews, and became a professor in the University there.\r\n\r\nHERSCHELL, Moses (Christian Moritz), was born at Breslau, September 13,\r\n1754. In 1804 he embraced Christianity, and at his baptism assumed the\r\nname of Christian Moritz. Among his works, the following deserve\r\nmentioning: \"Kampf der Jüdischen Hierarchie,\" Breslau, 1784; \"Jüdische\r\nIntoleranz und Fanatismus in Breslau,\" _ib_. 1789; \"Patriotische\r\nBemerkungen,\" _ib._ 1790; \"Ueber die Allzufrühen Ehen der Jüdischen\r\nNation,\" 1790; \"Apologie der Menschenrechte,\" Zurich, 1793; \"Biographie\r\ndes Jüdischen Gelehrten und Dichters, Ephraim Moses Kuh,\" _ib._ 1791.\r\n\r\nHERSCHELL, Rev. Ridley Hayim, born at Stozelno (Posen), April 7, 1807,\r\nwas strictly brought up, together with his four brothers, in Jewish\r\northodoxy. When quite young he had a desire to become a rabbi, and left\r\nhome seeking to enter some rabbinical school. In his wanderings he was\r\novertaken by robbers, but escaped. At the age of fourteen, he came to\r\nRabbi Aron in the town where his grandfather Hillel resided; there he\r\nremained two years among the Chassidim, seeking, after their manner, in\r\nvain to become perfectly righteous before God. How he came to the\r\nknowledge of Him who is the Lord our Righteousness, he has himself\r\nrecorded in the following pages:\r\n\r\n\"Having been favoured by God with pious parents, their great care was to\r\nimpress my mind from childhood with a profound reverence for God, and\r\nfor the Holy Scriptures. I was taught to repeat the morning and evening\r\nprayers with great solemnity; and on the feast days my attention was\r\nparticularly drawn to the impressive confession in our Liturgy, 'It is\r\nbecause of our sins we are driven away from our land,' &c. On the Day of\r\nAtonement I used to see my devout parents weep when they repeated the\r\npathetic confession that follows the enumeration of the sacrifices which\r\nwere appointed by God to be offered up for the sins of omission; and\r\nmany a time I shed sympathetic tears as I joined them in saying, that we\r\nhave now no temple, no high priest, no altar, and no sacrifices. As I\r\nadvanced in years and understanding, my religious impressions became\r\nstronger; fear and trembling often took hold upon me; and what was then\r\nmy refuge,--what the balm for my wounded spirit? Repeating more prayers,\r\nand asking God to accept the calves of my lips. This satisfied my mind\r\nat the time; but the satisfaction arose from ignorance of the character\r\nof God as a holy and a just Being, and of my own state as a guilty\r\nsinner, whose prayers proceeding from unclean lips, could not be\r\naccepted as a sweet savour by the thrice holy Lord God of Sabaoth.\r\n\r\n\"I continued in this state of mind until I was about sixteen years of\r\nage. During this period of my life, I often spent three sleepless nights\r\nin the week, studying the Talmud, and other Hebrew works. I also\r\ncommitted to memory several chapters of the prophets every week, in\r\norder that I might become sufficiently familiar with the Hebrew language\r\nto correspond in it. At this period I became acquainted with a Polish\r\nJew, who had studied several years at the University of Berlin, and\r\nconsequently had become acquainted with Gentile literature. He strongly\r\nadvised me to give up the study of the Talmud, and devote myself to the\r\nstudy of German and secular literature. After a hard struggle of mind, I\r\nresolved to follow his advice, and accordingly went to ----. Here there\r\nwas not only a change in the character of my studies, but an entire\r\nchange in my habits and mode of life. Many things that I formerly\r\nregarded as essential parts of my religion, were considered by my\r\nfellow-students _alt modisch_ (old fashioned), quite unfit for the\r\n_aufgeklärten_ (enlightened). At first my conscience was much disturbed,\r\nand I was often very unhappy; but, after a time, these feelings wore\r\noff; I conformed to the manners of my fellow-students, and I also\r\n'lived like a Christian,' as the Jews in those parts are wont to say of\r\nsuch of their brethren as have no fear of God before their eyes. I\r\nformed acquaintance with many young Gentiles; and this I could now do\r\nwith impunity, as neither they nor I troubled ourselves about each\r\nother's religion; neither of us, in reality, having any, although they\r\ncalled themselves Christians, and I was a Jew. The only thing that\r\nreminded me what people I belonged to, was the look of contempt I\r\nreceived now and then from Christians; and the little children in the\r\nstreets calling after me, 'Jew, Jew.' Then, indeed, I realized that I\r\nbelonged to the people who have become a proverb and a by-word among the\r\nGentiles.\r\n\r\n\"I well remember the first time I ever heard of one of my brethren\r\nbecoming a convert to Christianity. It was a young Jew, who was\r\napprenticed to a tradesman in the town where I studied. My idea of\r\nJewish converts to Christianity was, that they renounced their national\r\nprivileges and obligations; that they separated themselves from the\r\ncovenant God made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and publicly joined\r\nthemselves to the ungodly Gentiles, who live without God, and without\r\nhope in the world. Although at this time I had laid aside many of the\r\noutward observances of the Jewish religion, I had still a strong\r\nattachment to the fundamental doctrines of the Jewish faith, because I\r\nbelieved them to be of Divine origin. The idea of any Jew becoming a\r\nChristian, therefore, seemed to me a dreadful apostasy; and I regarded\r\nthe youth above-mentioned with mingled pity and contempt, as one who\r\nhad forsaken God, and given up all hope of eternal life.\r\n\r\n\"I pass over in silence several years of my life, which were devoted to\r\nthe world, and the things of the world; during which time I kept up such\r\na measure of conformity to the customs of my religion as I considered\r\nrespectable and consistent; but my early convictions and impressions\r\nwere faded and forgotten; and I belonged to that class whom the Psalmist\r\ndesignates 'men of the world, which have their portion in this life.'\r\n\r\n\"In process of time the Lord laid His afflicting hand upon me. The death\r\nof my beloved mother, whose tenderness to me I remember to this day with\r\nthe deepest gratitude and affection, was a heavy stroke to me, and\r\nplunged me into the utmost grief. I was then visited with sickness, and\r\nmy conscience became much disturbed. What I then endured can only be\r\nexpressed in the language of the sixth Psalm. I solemnly vowed to become\r\nvery religious; I resolved to fast one day in every week, to repeat many\r\nprayers, and show kindness and charity to the poor. But this could not\r\npacify my guilty conscience, as the study of German literature had\r\nweakened my confidence in religious observances,--had driven me from my\r\nown religion, and given me nothing in its place. One day I was in acute\r\ndistress of mind, feeling, as David expresses it, that I had sunk 'in\r\ndeep mire, where there is no standing'; that all my own efforts to free\r\nmyself were of no avail, my struggles only made me sink deeper and\r\ndeeper. For the first time in my life I prayed extempore. I cried out,\r\n'O God! I have no one to help me, and I dare not approach Thee, for I am\r\nguilty; help, O help me, for the sake of my father Abraham, who was\r\nwilling to offer up his son Isaac, have mercy upon me, and impute his\r\nrighteousness unto me.' But there was no answer from God,--no peace to\r\nmy wounded spirit. I felt as if God had forsaken me; as if the Lord had\r\ncast me off for ever, and would be favourable no more. I fully\r\nunderstood the words of the Psalmist, 'Mine iniquities have taken hold\r\nupon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs\r\nof my head; therefore my heart faileth me' (Psalm xl. 12); and I felt\r\nthat all my devotional exercises were what the prophet Isaiah was\r\ninstructed to declare the sacrifices and offerings of the Jews in his\r\ndays to be,--vain oblations, an abomination in the sight of God.\r\n\r\n\"I was far from my home and relatives; and my gay companions, seeing I\r\nwas depressed in spirits, though ignorant of the real cause of this\r\ndepression, earnestly urged me to frequent the theatres, and other\r\npublic amusements, to cheer my mind. At first this partially succeeded;\r\nbut the merciful kindness of God left me not thus to my own devices, but\r\ngraciously interposed, and again roused me to seek after more solid\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\"God, in his tender mercy, had again disturbed and disquieted my\r\nconscience so much, that I fully realised the words of the Psalmist, 'I\r\nam troubled, I am bowed down greatly, I go mourning all the day long,\r\nfor my loins are filled with a loathsome disease, and there is no\r\nsoundness in my flesh. I am feeble and sore broken; I have roared by\r\nreason of the disquietness of my heart' (Psalm xxxviii. 6-8). I had no\r\npeace nor rest; but wherever I went, or however I was employed, I\r\ncarried about with me a sense of misery that was intolerable. I could\r\nsay with Job, 'The arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison\r\nwhereof drinketh up my spirit' (Job vi. 4).\r\n\r\n\"One morning I went to purchase an article in a shop, little knowing\r\nthat God had there stored up for me the 'pearl of great price,' which He\r\nwas about to give me 'without money and without price.' The article I\r\npurchased was wrapped up in a leaf of the Bible, which contained a\r\nportion of the Sermon on the Mount. The shopkeeper was, probably, an\r\ninfidel, who thought the Bible merely waste paper; but God over-ruled\r\nthe evil for good. As I was walking home my eyes glanced on the words:\r\n'Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.' This\r\narrested my attention, and I read the whole passage with deep interest.\r\n\r\n\"'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for their's is the kingdom of heaven.\r\nBlessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are\r\nthe meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they which do\r\nhunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. Blessed\r\nare the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in\r\nheart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they\r\nshall be called the children of God. Blessed are they which are\r\npersecuted for righteousness' sake, for their's is the kingdom of\r\nheaven.' (St. Matthew v. 3-10.)\r\n\r\n\"I was much struck with the sentiments contained in this passage, and\r\nfelt very desirous to see the book of which it was a portion; I had no\r\nidea what book it was, never having seen a New Testament. A few days\r\nafter, God directed my footsteps to the house of an acquaintance, on\r\nwhose table lay a copy of the New Testament. Impelled by curiosity I\r\ntook it up, and in turning over the leaves beheld the very passage that\r\nhad interested me so much. I immediately borrowed it, and began to read\r\nit with great avidity. At first I felt quite bewildered, and was so\r\nshocked by the constant recurrence of the name of Jesus, that I\r\nrepeatedly cast the book away. At length I determined to read it\r\nthrough. When I came to the twenty-third chapter of the Gospel of St.\r\nMatthew, I was astonished at the full disclosure of the nature of\r\nPharisaism, contained in it; and Christ's lamentation over Jerusalem, in\r\nthe concluding part: 'O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the\r\nprophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I\r\nhave gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her\r\nchickens under her wings, and ye would not!' affected me even to tears.\r\nIn reading the account of the crucifixion, the meekness and love of\r\nJesus of Nazareth astonished me; and the cruel hatred manifested against\r\nHim by the priests and rulers in Israel, excited within me a feeling of\r\ncompassion for Him, and of indignation against His murderers. But I did\r\nnot as yet see any connexion between the sufferings of Jesus and my\r\nsins.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1828 he entered the Operative Jewish Converts' Institution, which\r\nwas under the superintendence of Erasmus Simon, and was baptized April\r\n14, 1830, when he took the name of his godfather, Rev. Henry Calbone\r\nRidley. Owing to some scruples, he preferred to enter the nonconformist\r\nministry, in which he also zealously laboured for the spiritual welfare\r\nof his brethren. He was one of the founders of the British Society.\r\nAmong his converts was Dr. A. Fürst, a very able missionary of that\r\nSociety. Ridley Herschell edited a periodical under the title, \"Voice of\r\nIsrael.\" He wrote also an account of his journey to his home, \"A Visit\r\nto my Fatherland\"; \"Reasons why I am not a Roman Catholic.\" With the\r\nassistance of Sir Culling Eardley he built Trinity Chapel, Regent\r\nStreet, where he was, one might say, a father to the converts in London\r\nin 1845-6, and they reciprocated his love by sixty of them presenting\r\nhim with a polyglot Bible, in eight languages, in 1845.\r\n\r\nHERSCHELL, Rev. David Abraham, a brother of the above, a very saintly\r\nman, baptized in Basel, 1845, was first his assistant at Trinity Chapel\r\nand afterwards, nearly all his life, minister of the Congregational\r\nChurch, Loughborough Park, Brixton.\r\n\r\nHERSCHELL, Rev. Louis, another brother, laboured for many years as\r\nmissionary and deputation of the British Society, and was a minister at\r\nWare, and later at Peckham Rye, London. He died in 1890.\r\n\r\nHERSCHELL, Rev. Victor, another brother, emigrated to the United States,\r\nwas baptized in the Seventh Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, and was\r\nordained to the ministry there.\r\n\r\nThe son of the fourth brother, who remained in Judaism till late in\r\nlife, embraced Christianity in Germany.\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL, Sir William, English astronomer, born at Hanover, November 15,\r\n1738, died at Slough, August 22, 1822. His father, Abraham, brought him\r\nup as a musician, and in that capacity he went to England in 1755, in\r\nthe band of the Hanoverian guards, and for a considerable time earned\r\nhis living as a teacher of music, obtaining a position as organist in\r\nBath, in 1760. This seems to show, in all probability, that either he\r\nwas baptized during this interval of five years in England, or that he\r\nwas baptized in Germany. For as a professing Jew he would scarcely have\r\nventured at that time to apply for the position of an organist, neither\r\nwould his services have been accepted. He is known as the founder of\r\nSidereal Science. His views on the position of the Solar System, in\r\nrelation to the Milky Way, still form the central factor in the modern\r\ntheory as to the constitution of the universe. He is also known as the\r\ndiscoverer of the infra-red solar rays.\r\n\r\nHERSHON, Paul Isaac, was born in Buczacz (Galicia) in 1818, where he\r\nreceived an excellent Hebrew and Talmudical education. Going to\r\nJerusalem he came under the influence of Nicolayson, and was baptized by\r\nhim. He then studied in the Jerusalem Missionary College from 1842 to\r\n1846. Afterwards he was appointed principal of the House of Industry,\r\nand then from 1848-55 he laboured as missionary in England. Then he was\r\nappointed as head of the model farm at Jaffa, which office he resigned\r\non account of illness in 1869, and returned to England. Henceforth he\r\ndevoted himself to literary work, and wrote \"Extracts from the Talmud,\"\r\n1860; \"The Pentateuch according to the Talmud,\" Hebrew, 1874; \"A\r\nTalmudical Miscellany,\" 1880; \"Treasures of the Talmud,\" 1882. He died\r\nin London, 1888.\r\n\r\nHERTZ, Henrik, Danish poet, born at Copenhagen, August 25, 1798; died\r\nthere February 25, 1870. He embraced Christianity in 1832. His dramatic\r\nworks alone comprise eighteen volumes and were published in 1854-73.\r\n\r\nHEYNEMANN. From this family in Saxony, whose head was Court\r\nCommissioner, no less than nine persons embraced the Protestant faith\r\nabout 1749.\r\n\r\nHIERONOMY, David, baptized with his wife and six children in 1676, was\r\nnominated by the King Friedrich of Prussia as Inspector of the\r\nSynagogue. He had to suffer martyrdom.\r\n\r\nHIRSCH, Rev. David Jacoby, was born in 1820 at Sandersleben, in the\r\nDuchy of Anhalt. His parents were strict Jews. He received his early\r\neducation at a school in Dessau. When he was a young man he came over to\r\nEngland, and in 1844 got to know the late Dr. Marsh, who first spoke to\r\nhim of Christ. This led him to study the Word of God, and to enquire how\r\nhe, a sinner, could be saved. Subsequently, Dr. Baylee, of Birkenhead,\r\ntook a great interest in him, as he taught his boys German, French,\r\nLatin, and Hebrew. From him he received instruction in the Christian\r\nfaith, and at the end of 1845 was baptized by him, and married his\r\ndaughter. Later on he was ordained by Bishop Sumner for the German\r\npastorhood at Liverpool, a post he filled until 1852, when he added to\r\nhis pastoral duties missionary work among the Jews, receiving a grant\r\nfrom the Society for twelve years. He then retired until his death, in\r\n1898, greatly missed by all who knew him.\r\n\r\nHIRSCH, Paul Wilhelm, was baptized in 1692, taught Hebrew, and issued a\r\npamphlet in Berlin, 1717, under the title \"Entdeckung der Tekuphath,\" in\r\nwhich he exposes the superstition held by rabbinic Jews, and then\r\npublished in the calendar, that at the entrance of each of the four\r\nseasons of the year the fluid of the vessels containing water is turned\r\ninto blood. This superstition has probably done them much harm.\r\n\r\nHIRSCH, Siegfried, born in 1816, studied history under the celebrated\r\nhistorian Ranke. Through the influence of Neander he became a devoted\r\nChristian. In 1844 he was appointed professor of history in the\r\nUniversity of Berlin, where he was esteemed and beloved by the students.\r\nHe was one of the founders of the conservative paper \"Kreuz Zeitung.\" He\r\ndied in 1860.\r\n\r\nHIRSCH, Theodor, born 1806 in Altschottland, near Danzig, embraced\r\nChristianity through the influence of Schleiermacher. He too became\r\nprofessor of history, first at Danzig, and later, in 1865, at\r\nGreifswald. In spite of his great learning, it is recorded that he was a\r\nvery quiet and humble man. He died in 1881.\r\n\r\nHOGA, Stanislaus, a native of Casimir, Russia, was, after embracing\r\nChristianity, a missionary of L.J.S. in London. He was mostly engaged in\r\nliterary work, and translated \"Songs of Zion,\" a selection of English\r\nand German Hymns, into Hebrew (1834--with additions, 1842); a\r\ntranslation of McCaul's \"Old Paths\" into Hebrew; \"Nethivoth Olam,\" 1851;\r\na Hebrew grammar of the English language, 1840; \"The Controversy of\r\nZion,\" a meditation on Judaism and Christianity, 1845; \"Halichoth Orah,\"\r\nwhich is a translation of Bunyan's \"Pilgrim's Progress\"; \"Eldad and\r\nMedad,\" which is a dialogue contrasting the New Testament and the\r\nTalmud; \"Malakh Haberith,\" a translation of the tract \"Angel of the\r\nCovenant.\" He also, together with Reichardt, revised the old edition of\r\nthe Hebrew New Testament.\r\n\r\nILIEWITZ, Alexander, a medical missionary long connected with the\r\nSociety's work in Jerusalem. It would not be easy to mention a\r\nmissionary who, throughout a long career of labour, had shown more\r\nloving sympathy for his brethren, or more patience and self-denial in\r\nlabouring for their good, than he did. He was not a theologian, or a\r\nTalmudical scholar, and was not fitted for carrying on learned\r\ndisputations with highly educated Jews. But he had a simple, trustful\r\nfaith, which made him never tired of proclaiming the way of salvation. A\r\nlearned rabbi, widely celebrated for his profound knowledge of the\r\nCabbala, complained that he had dared to preach Christ to _him_. \"I did\r\nnot send for him,\" said the rabbi indignantly, \"to tell me that the\r\nMessiah has come. I sent for him to prescribe for my bad feet.\" He was\r\nin a special way the friend and helper of the poor and unlearned. He\r\nused to tell a sad story about a young Jew of this kind who died of\r\ncholera in 1865. When dying, this poor lad whispered to Mr. Iliewitz as\r\nhe stood by his bedside, \"You have often told me to 'kiss the Son lest\r\nHe be angry.' He _is_ angry! He _is_ angry!\" and so passed away.\r\n\r\nHis early life was one of continuous trial and struggle. His father died\r\nbefore he was born. At an early age he left home and became apprentice\r\nin a surgeon's shop at Berditcheff, where he remained three years. He\r\nthen removed to Odessa, and afterwards to Galicia, where he stayed eight\r\nyears with a surgeon. He entered the college at Lemberg, passed the\r\nexaminations, and received his medical diplomas.\r\n\r\nThe crisis of his life was now approaching. He was taken ill, and this\r\nmade him think about his soul. \"I knew the Almighty God,\" he wrote at a\r\nsubsequent period, \"only from nature. I saw how gracious and merciful He\r\nwas towards me, and therefore I lifted up my hands and eyes to Him, and\r\nprayed in my ignorance: O Lord, Thou hast made me so that I could learn\r\nmany scientific and useful things, grant me now also opportunity to be\r\nbetter informed of Thy Holy Name. In this also the Shepherd of Israel\r\nheard me.\" After his recovery he removed to Pesth, where he met\r\nmissionaries; he was taught the way of salvation. In 1845 he was\r\nbaptized, and in 1856 he was sent to Bucharest. Two years later he was\r\ntransferred to Jerusalem as assistant medical missionary, in which\r\ncapacity he laboured until within a year or two of his death. He passed\r\naway on June, 1895, aged 80. Many will rise hereafter and call him\r\nblessed, having received the first seeds of eternal life through him.\r\n\r\nIMMANUEL, Siegmund (Salomon Jacob), born in Hamburg, 1792, died at\r\nMinden, 1847. Seeking for true religion, he found it in the Gospel, and\r\nembraced Christianity in 1809. When still a student at the Gymnasium of\r\nAltona he wrote a treatise entitled, \"Animadversiones ad Coluthe carmen\r\nde rapta Helena cum specimine Versionis Germanicæ.\" He then studied\r\ntheology at Helmstadt, Göttingen and Leipzig till 1813. After being a\r\nprivate teacher at the house of the Russian General Berdiageff he, in\r\n1814, became state teacher at Hirschberg, in Silesia, and in 1821 was\r\nappointed Principal of the Gymnasium at Minden, which position he held\r\nuntil his death. He was the first principal to introduce gymnastics into\r\nthe school curriculum (1831), and to divide the Gymnasium into\r\ndepartments of arts and sciences (1840). Among Immanuel's works may be\r\nmentioned: \"Die Anfänge der Reformation und die Gründung des Gymnasium\r\nin Minden\" (Minden, 1822), \"Declamation Unterricht auf Schulen\" (_ib._\r\n1824), \"Historischer Unterricht auf Gymnasium\" (_ib._ 1827), \"Gutachten\r\nüber Herrn Lorinser's Schrift zum Schutze der Gesundheit auf Schulen\"\r\n(Bieldfeld, 1836).\r\n\r\nISAACS, Rev. Albert Augustus. The cause of missions to Jews possessed a\r\nvery intelligent and warm-hearted advocate in the Rev. Albert Augustus\r\nIsaacs, who was himself, as his name indicates, of Jewish parentage, and\r\nwho throughout his long life, identified himself with every movement for\r\nthe welfare of his brethren according to the flesh.\r\n\r\nMr. Isaacs was born in the island of Jamaica, on January 24th, 1826, at\r\nBerry Hill, a coffee plantation, of which his father was the owner.\r\nJamaica was at that time one of the most prosperous colonies of Great\r\nBritain. His father, Isaac Isaacs, had become a convert to Christianity\r\nsome years previously. We have no authentic particulars of his father's\r\nlife, although we have an idea that in the story of \"The Star of Peace,\"\r\nby \"Ben Abram,\" which ran through the first two volumes of \"The\r\nEverlasting Nation,\" the adventures of Isaac Da Costa, in Jamaica and in\r\nEngland, were those of his own father.\r\n\r\nAlbert was his second son, and was sent to England for his education,\r\nwhich was received at Maze Hill, Greenwich, under Dr. Smithers. The\r\nreligious instruction in the school, and preparation for confirmation,\r\nthough slight in themselves, led him to serious reflection, and were the\r\nmeans of deciding him to give his heart to Christ at the age of\r\nfourteen, and they influenced his future career. When he left school\r\nAlbert returned to Jamaica for four years, at the expiration of which\r\ntime, on the recommendation of Canon Carus, he entered Corpus Christi\r\nCollege, Cambridge, being a contemporary of one who afterwards became\r\nmaster, Dr. Perowne, and of Bishop Moule, of Mid-China. Young Isaacs'\r\nresidence at Cambridge was marked by a strict adherence to his\r\ncollegiate studies, which he commenced daily at five o'clock in the\r\nmorning. His religious life was very fruitful, he being a teacher in the\r\nJesus Lane Sunday School, the founder of the Cambridge University Prayer\r\nUnion, and the organizer in his college of successful efforts on behalf\r\nof the Bible Society and the Church Missionary Society. He himself\r\nardently desired to become a missionary, his sympathies being especially\r\ndrawn towards East Africa. The door, however, was not open in that\r\ndirection, and so after taking his degree in 1850, he was ordained in\r\nthe same year by Dr. Davys, Bishop of Peterborough, and licensed to the\r\ncuracy of the parish church in that city, of which the Bishop's son, a\r\nwell known evangelical of those days, was the vicar. If our supposition\r\nabout \"Ben Abram's\" story is true, the following information from the\r\nlast chapter but one of the \"Star of Peace\" is interesting. We read\r\nthere that Isaac Da Costa (his father) had so arranged his movements as\r\nto be present on an occasion of great interest to himself and others,\r\nand with no little pleasure was looking forward to the opportunity of\r\nwitnessing his son's ordination. He had been unable to say what might be\r\nthe day of his arrival, as the voyage from Jamaica to New York was made\r\nat irregular intervals, and it would appear that he arrived too late to\r\nwitness that rite, for we read, \"All was silent as the night in the\r\nlittle cathedral town in which Da Costa's son had begun his ministerial\r\nwork. It was late when the last train arrived from the west, and a cab\r\ncontaining the father drove to the lodgings of the son. The sound of a\r\nbell vibrated upon the ears of those who were slumbering; but it was not\r\nso loud as to arouse them to consciousness. But early in the morning a\r\nmessenger arrived from the chief hotel to announce the arrival of Mr. Da\r\nCosta. Telegrams were not so far available in those days as to enable\r\nhim to communicate the fact of his arrival. It was Saturday night, and\r\nDa Costa had calculated on the enjoyment of the services of the Lord's\r\nDay amidst the scenes of his son's labours. As these consisted of four\r\nseparate services--in whole or in part--he had the evidence that his lot\r\nwas not cast in idle, although it was in pleasant, places.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Isaacs remained in the curacy at Peterborough for two years,\r\ndischarging his ministerial duties with zeal and ability. In 1852 he\r\nbecame an association secretary of the L.J.S., having charge of the\r\ncounties of Norfolk, Suffolk and Lincoln. The following year he was\r\nappointed assistant clerical and association secretary for the north\r\nmetropolitan district. Mr. Isaacs had married the eldest daughter of the\r\nRev. J. M. Johnson, rector of Scoulton, Norfolk, and a niece of Lord\r\nBerners. She was a remarkably clever linguist and a student of Hebrew.\r\nShe died in 1856, after a very brief married life. After her death Mr.\r\nIsaacs visited Palestine in the winter of 1856-7, and found the\r\nparticulars gleaned during that visit of much subsequent use in his\r\nadvocacy of the cause. He gathered the materials for subsequent books,\r\ntook numerous views of the country, and bought a property near Jaffa\r\ncalled \"The Model Farm,\" which, under an edict of the Sublime Porte,\r\nwas made over to him as a British subject. He visited Palestine again in\r\n1869, and was a traveller also in various parts of the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Isaacs married, secondly, in 1861, the eldest daughter of the Rev.\r\nS. H. Causton, Vicar of Highgate, and a niece of Lord Lilford, who died\r\nin 1866, leaving two children, Miss Annie Isaacs and the Rev. Wilfrid\r\nHenry Isaacs. Thirty years later, in 1896, Mr. Isaacs married Mrs.\r\nPeppin, the widow of Surgeon-Major Peppin, and daughter of James\r\nHerdman, Esq., of Zion House, co. Tyrone, Ireland, who survived him.\r\n\r\nMr. Isaacs was Jubilee Secretary for the L.J.S. during the year\r\ncommencing February 15, 1858, and ending on the same date in 1859, which\r\npost entailed upon him much additional labour, to which he always looked\r\nback with considerable pleasure. He resigned his secretaryship in July,\r\n1859, having served the Society with great acceptance for nearly seven\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nMr. Isaacs now went to Jamaica on a short visit to his family, and\r\nimproved the occasion by giving lectures, which were attended by crowds,\r\nin order to stir up an interest in the Holy Land. He had given a very\r\ngreat deal of attention to photography, a difficult pursuit for the\r\namateur in those days, and was the first to introduce it into his native\r\ncountry. On his return to England, he occupied successively posts at\r\nLaura Chapel, Bath; in London; at Hanford, in Staffordshire; and at the\r\nPriory Church, Malvern.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, he was appointed by Lord Berners, vicar of Christ Church,\r\nLeicester, in his old diocese of Peterborough, where for more than 25\r\nyears he laboured in season and out of season, carrying on his ministry\r\non staunch Protestant and evangelical lines, and being surrounded by a\r\nlarge band of fellow-workers, who heartily appreciated his teaching and\r\nwork. The parish was thoroughly re-organized; numerous useful agencies\r\nstarted; the church restored and its accommodation increased; schools\r\nand other buildings erected. Mr. Isaacs was known as \"the Jew of\r\nLeicester,\" and continued his great interest in all efforts for the\r\nconversion of his brethren to Christianity. He also rendered much and\r\nconspicuous voluntary aid to other Societies, notably the Church\r\nMissionary Society, the Church Pastoral Aid Society, and the Church\r\nAssociation, as well as to all local institutions and enterprises.\r\n\r\nMr. Isaacs took great interest in elementary education, and was returned\r\nat the head of the poll, by a majority of nearly 4,000 votes over the\r\nsecond candidate, at the first School Board election in Leicester. He\r\nalso greatly interested himself in, and was successful in raising the\r\ntone of the Police Force, the members of which most thoroughly enjoyed\r\nthe winter and summer treats which he arranged for them. Mr. Isaacs was\r\nalso chaplain of the Leicester gaol, a work in which he took the keenest\r\ninterest, and where he was the means of leading many a sin-stricken soul\r\nto the Saviour of sinners; and reforming the lives of those who had been\r\nled astray principally through strong drink. The work at Leicester was\r\nthus of a very arduous character. Notwithstanding the poverty of his\r\nparish, Mr. Isaacs raised as much as £25,000 for various objects during\r\nhis incumbency. His whole ministry eloquently testified to the power of\r\na simple and faithfully proclaimed Gospel.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 Mr. Isaacs was appointed to the incumbency of St. Augustine's,\r\nBath, or, as it had long been known, Portland Chapel, which position he\r\nheld till 1899. It was a post after his own heart, with its associations\r\nand traditions handed down from a long succession of faithful Protestant\r\nministers. For a short time he was in charge of Eaton Chapel, in London.\r\nMr. Isaacs frequently took chaplaincies on the continent, especially in\r\nHolland and Germany, and in 1902 he became resident English chaplain to\r\nChrist Church, Düsseldorf, and ministered to the congregation there up\r\nto the day of his death, on Sunday, November 15, 1903.\r\n\r\nHis home-call was very sudden, and found him in full work, just as he\r\nwould have desired. He had no previous illness.\r\n\r\nThe funeral took place on Thursday morning, November 19, at the\r\nbeautiful Friedhof cemetery at Düsseldorf, where he rests. Amongst the\r\ncompany present were Mr. Mulvany, the British Consul, with Mrs. and Miss\r\nMulvany, and about 120 other friends, mostly attendants at the Consulate\r\nChapel. The memorial sermons were preached on the following Sunday in\r\nthe Consulate Chapel by the Rev. T. H. Sparshott. When Mr. Isaacs went\r\nthere the congregation numbered only about thirteen persons. He soon\r\ngathered round him, however, an attached people, upon whose affections\r\nhe obtained a strong hold, and his ministry was very gratefully\r\nwelcomed. Not only did he increase the attendance at the Sunday services\r\ntill an excellent congregation was built up, but on Thursday afternoons,\r\nat his own residence, he held Bible readings and social gatherings,\r\nwhich were warmly appreciated by a large number of young men and women.\r\nThose who understand the intense loneliness of British residents in a\r\ncontinental city, especially one somewhat off the beaten route of\r\ntourists, will readily comprehend how much such kind hospitality and\r\nfriendly intercourse must have meant to strangers in a strange land.\r\n\r\nMr. Isaacs' travels familiarized him with Palestine, and he wrote \"The\r\nDead Sea\" (1857); and \"A Pictorial Tour in the Holy Land\" (1858). He was\r\nalso the author of the well-known \"Biography of the Rev. Henry Aaron\r\nStern, D.D.\" (1886); and the editor of four volumes of \"The Everlasting\r\nNation\" (1889-92). Amongst his other publications may be mentioned \"Emma\r\nHerdman, Missionary Labours in the Empire of Morocco\" (1900); \"The\r\nFountain of Siena, an Episode in the Life of John Ruskin\" (1900); \"In\r\nthe Lord,\" a series of articles, published in the \"English Churchman\"\r\n(1901); a series of articles entitled \"The Tabernacle and the Temple,\"\r\npublished in the \"Protestant Alliance\" magazine (1902); followed by a\r\nsecond series in the same magazine, (1903), entitled \"The Protestants of\r\nthe Bible\"; and \"The New Vicar\" (1903), published posthumously.\r\n\r\nBesides his literary gifts, Mr. Isaacs possessed considerable gifts and\r\ntalents in art and in music, being a keen judge of both. He had some\r\nknowledge of colloquial French, Italian, and German, and not long before\r\nhis death gave a short address in German at a mission hall on \"I am the\r\nway, the truth and the life,\" which was listened to with marked\r\nattention. He had promised to give a second address on the Wednesday\r\nwhich followed his death.\r\n\r\nMr. Isaacs was a man of keen intellect, marked ability, deeply taught by\r\nthe Spirit of God, and a faithful servant of Christ during his long\r\nministerial career of fifty-three years. His Jewish descent, his\r\nacquaintance with the language and customs of the Jews, his sympathy\r\nwith them and zeal for their conversion made him a strong and an\r\nacceptable advocate in the cause of Jewish missions. He was a Life\r\nMember of the L.J.S., and frequently attended the meetings of the\r\nCommittee, where his long and varied experience, and prudent counsels\r\nwere fully appreciated.\r\n\r\nIt will be easily gathered from the above that Mr. Isaacs' life was\r\nextremely rich in incident and experience. He was blessed with wonderful\r\nstrength and health, which he attributed greatly to total abstinence\r\nfrom alcohol and smoking, and enjoyed the friendship of many prominent\r\npeople, amongst whom may be mentioned Prince Münster.\r\n\r\nMr. Isaacs in his own person was a proof of the success of Jewish\r\nevangelization, and of its far-reaching consequences, and we would close\r\nthis brief biography of our departed friend with the last words from his\r\n\"Star of Peace\":--\r\n\r\n\"When Isaac Da Costa arranged for the baptism of his children he was, in\r\nthe providence of God, opening the floodgates of blessing for himself\r\nand family. The consequences were to be widespread as well as important.\r\nUp to that time, not one of his family in any of its branches had ever\r\nbeen brought out of Judaism into the full revelation in Christ of the\r\nLaw and the Prophets. But when he closed his eyes, he left behind him\r\nthe record of every member of his family but one, both on his own and on\r\nhis wife's side, having embraced the Christian faith, and thus set their\r\nseal to the truth and inspiration of God's Holy Word.\"\r\n\r\nJACOB, John, a Jew from Poland, was baptized in England, in the\r\nseventeenth century. In 1679 he wrote a tract under the title, \"The Jew\r\nturned Christian, or The Corner Stone,\" which was translated into Dutch\r\nand published in Amsterdam, under the title, \"Jesus de waare\r\nHoeckstein.\" In this he magnifies the grace of God as manifested in and\r\nthrough Christ Jesus, by which alone fallen man can find acceptance in\r\nGod's sight and realize perfect peace and salvation.\r\n\r\nJACOBI, B. T., was born in Königsberg, 1807. His father went to England,\r\nand became a Christian there. During his absence his wife, not knowing\r\nat all about her husband's religious change, embraced Christianity, and\r\nwas baptized with her four children. Jacobi studied theology, and was\r\nappointed Chaplain, at the George Hospital, Königsberg, having also the\r\npastoral charge of the Workhouse, and giving religious instruction in a\r\nHigh School. From 1858 he was also acting as missionary of the British\r\nSociety, and quite a number of Jews of the higher class were won by him\r\nfor the Saviour. He was permitted to celebrate his ministerial Jubilee\r\nin 1877.\r\n\r\nJACOBI, Karl Gustav Jakob, born at Potsdam, 1804, died at Berlin, 1851.\r\nHe was a distinguished Professor of Mathematics at the University of\r\nKönigsberg and Berlin from 1825, and, together with Abel, made his\r\nepoch-making discoveries in the field of elliptic functions. Most of\r\nJacobi's papers were published in Crelle's Journal, \"Für die Reine und\r\nAngewardte Mathematik,\" and in the \"Monatsberichte\" of the Berlin\r\nAcademy of Sciences, of which he became a member in 1836. Of his\r\nindependent works may be mentioned: \"Fundamenta Novæ Theoriæ Functiones\r\nEllipticorum,\" Königsberg, 1829; and \"Canon Arithmeticus,\" Berlin, 1839.\r\nJacobi's lectures on dynamics were published in Berlin in 1866 and 1884.\r\nThe Berlin Academy of Sciences published his \"Gesammelte Werke,\" 8\r\nvols., 1881-91.\r\n\r\nJACOBI, Heinrich Otto, born at Tutz, West Prussia, and educated in a\r\nJewish school in Berlin. He was baptized by Pastor Hossbach. After\r\nteaching in several schools, he became Professor of Greek Philology at\r\nthe Fried. Wilh. Gymnasium of Berlin in 1860. He wrote several treatises\r\nin the Greek language, and received the degree of D.Ph. from the\r\nUniversity of Königsberg, even without passing an examination. He died\r\nin 1864.\r\n\r\nJACOBSOHN, S. S., born in German Ostrowo, 1810. He went to Berlin and\r\nstudied painting in the Academy of Arts. After being an earnest enquirer\r\nfor a year, he was baptized by Pastor Kunze in 1831. Two years later he\r\nentered the service of the Berlin Jewish Society, and laboured among the\r\nJews until 1871, with great patience and love toward them, so that many\r\nacknowledged that he was a true Christian. He published a tract\r\nentitled, \"Immanuel, die Erscheinung des Messias in Knechtsgestalt,\r\nseine Erlösungsthätigkeit und die Ausbreitung seines Reiches nach\r\nJesaia\" (Berlin).\r\n\r\nJACOBSON, Heinrich Friedrich, born in Morenwerder, 1804, died in 1868,\r\nas a true pious Christian, lamented by all who knew him. He became\r\nOrdinary Professor of Jurisprudence at the University of Königsberg in\r\n1836. He was author, among other works, of \"Geschichte der Quellen des\r\nKatholischen Kirchenrechts der Provinzen Preusen und Posen,\" (1839);\r\nlikewise \"Geschichte der Quellen des evangelischen Kirchenrechts,\" of\r\nthe same provinces, (1844). His chief work was, \"Das Evangelische\r\nKirchenrecht des Preusischen Staates und seiner Provinzen,\" (Halle,\r\n1862-66).\r\n\r\nJACOBSON, Jacob, was born at Goldingen, in the province of Courland,\r\nRussia. He tells his own story thus:--\r\n\r\n\"My parents early taught me to value the precepts, rites, and ordinances\r\nof Judaism, which they most rigidly observed. They therefore early\r\nplaced me under the care of a Talmudical tutor, to be instructed in the\r\nJewish faith, which consisted in the religious observances established\r\nby the authority of the Rabbis, and the promised reward to those who\r\nadhere to them.\r\n\r\n\"As I grew older, and began to reflect upon the nature and principles of\r\nJudaism as practised in the synagogue, my understanding showed me that\r\nsuch formal worship could not be in accordance with the will of God,\r\nthat something or other was deficient in the system, there being nothing\r\nsolid to influence the heart and give vitality to the worshipper. I\r\ncould not help experiencing at times something like a vagueness in my\r\nmind with regard to my religious perceptions.\r\n\r\n\"By the providence of God I was led to leave home; and, although it was\r\ncontrary to the wishes of my parents, I set out on my journey, and in\r\ndue course arrived in England, in the City of London. After my sojourn\r\nthere for some time, I was incidentally brought into contact, for the\r\nfirst time in my life, with one of those messengers who are sent out by\r\nthe British Society for the Propagation of the Gospel among the Jews,\r\nwhose work is to disseminate the Word of Life. It was by him that the\r\nGospel was, in the first instance, proclaimed in my ears. Though some\r\nimpression was made on my mind in consequence of his preaching, I\r\nnevertheless resisted it, on account of the deep-rooted prejudice I had\r\nimbibed against the Christian religion, and I refused his kind\r\ninvitation to go to his house.\r\n\r\n\"God, who guides the destiny of men in a most marvellous way did, by His\r\ngracious design, cause me again to meet the same missionary, who once\r\nmore entreated me to accept Jesus as the Messiah, and to search into the\r\ntruth of the Christian religion. As on the former occasion, I again\r\nresisted with increased strength, and again declined his kind\r\ninvitation. Still, the impression which was left on my mind on this\r\nsecond occasion, led me to reflect upon the question at issue between\r\nJews and Christians, and whether this Jesus, whom our forefathers had\r\nrejected, was the same who should redeem Israel. Thus I was for some\r\ntime perplexed and undecided, and in my perplexity I at length resolved\r\nthat I would go to the missionary's house, not with any desire to be\r\nconverted, but simply for further information.\r\n\r\n\"I thus became directed to read the Word of God, in order to verify the\r\npredictions which refer to the Messiah, and their fulfilment in the\r\nPerson of Jesus Christ. I then began to read the New Testament, and to\r\ncompare this with the Old, and, in course of time, the doing so\r\nterminated in my conviction that Jesus is indeed the Messiah, who gave\r\nHimself a sacrifice for sin, and was cut off but not for Himself. After\r\nsome inward struggle of mind, my agitated feelings may be better\r\nconceived than described, and in spite of all hindrances that presented\r\nthemselves, I was enabled, by the grace of God and the enlightening\r\ninfluence of the Holy Spirit to decide for Christ, and He became my Lord\r\nand Saviour. I avowed myself by public baptism a believer in the Triune\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n\"After some years of Christian life, I was called to the service of God,\r\nin making known the same Saviour and the same Gospel I had received to\r\nour benighted Jewish brethren, and, by the grace of God, I have been\r\nengaged in so doing for fifteen years, in Newcastle and the district.\r\nThe Lord has graciously blessed my humble efforts, and unto Him I\r\nascribe the glory.\"\r\n\r\nJACOBY, Dr. Ludwig, was the founder of German Methodism at St. Louis,\r\nMi., U.S.A., and helped to spread it in Germany, in the latter half of\r\nthe 19th century. His biography is found in the Rev. Fr. Kopp's\r\ncharacteristic pictures from the history of Methodism.\r\n\r\nJACOBY, Rev., was one of Dr. McCaul's converts in Warsaw, and missionary\r\nof the Protestant Episcopal Church to the Jews in New York. He became\r\nlater on an earnest Army Chaplain in a small-pox hospital during the\r\nCivil War, in Washington, 1864.\r\n\r\nJAFFE, Philipp, M.D. and historian, born at Schwersenz, Posen, 1819,\r\nstudied under Ranke in Berlin, where he won the history prize. He\r\npublished \"Monumenta Germaniæ Historica,\" 1854-63; \"Bibliotheca rerum\r\nGermanicarum,\" 1864; \"Regesta pontificum Rom. a Condita Ecclesia ad\r\nAnnum post Chr. 1198\"; in which work no less than 11,000 papal documents\r\nand letters were investigated, and in consequence received the attention\r\nof Pius IX. These ecclesiastical studies led him finally to embrace\r\nChristianity in 1868.\r\n\r\nJAFFE, Philipp, son of Rabbi Baer of Gnesen, Posen, was born in 1824.\r\nNaturally he was brought up in strict orthodoxy and early imbibed\r\nprejudices against Christianity, so that when reading a book in the\r\nschool he refused to utter the name of Jesus. His father sent him later\r\nto Wales to learn commerce at the house of a relative. Then a Christian\r\nlady gave him a New Testament which he secretly read, and that became\r\nthe means of his conversion. He studied in London, and at the age of\r\ntwenty-six he was ordained in the presence of the then Secretary of the\r\nBritish Society, whose service he afterwards entered and laboured as a\r\nmissionary in Bristol and in Birmingham; and then from 1853 till 1857 at\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Oder, Nüremberg and Hamburg. He was instrumental in the\r\nconversion of a number of Jews, among whom was a Jewess 83 years of age,\r\nand also in the conversion of a Roman Catholic priest.\r\n\r\nJAIR and JAN, Dr. Aga, two Persian Jews, the latter of whom especially\r\nwas under the influence of the C.M.S. missionary, the Rev. Dr. Bruce.\r\nThey were baptized by the Armenian Protestant pastor in Hamadan in 1878.\r\n\r\nJANASZ, Adolf, proprietor of an estate at Ploch, near Warsaw, having\r\ntogether with his father embraced Christianity, and then afterwards\r\nmarried the daughter of the L.J.S. missionary Rosenthal, henceforth\r\ndevoted himself to good works and especially to promote Christianity\r\namong the Jews by word and deed. In 1863, after the Polish revolution,\r\nhe founded an orphanage on his estate, which he maintained at his own\r\nexpense. He also appointed a Bible-woman in Warsaw to visit the Jews,\r\nand always showed sympathy and rendered practical help to the\r\nmissionaries, and sent from time to time considerable contributions to\r\nthe L.J.S. He published a little excellent work in German, entitled \"Die\r\nZukunft des Volkes Israel,\" Berlin, 1882.\r\n\r\nJANY, a Jewish officer who served in the Prussian army from 1806 to\r\n1815, afterwards embraced Christianity, and then devoted himself\r\nespecially, till the age of 90, to the care of the deaf and dumb, and\r\nwas one of the presidents of the Deaf and Dumb Institution at\r\nKönigsberg.\r\n\r\nJASU, was one of the three Falasha converts who carried on the work of\r\nthe mission during the imprisonment of the missionaries in Abyssinia.\r\n\r\nJEDIDA, Hirsch Leib, Smlinsky, born in Gragewo, Russia, 1847. After\r\nbeing strictly brought up and becoming Bar Mitzvah (confirmed) at the\r\nage of 13, he studied at several rabbinic schools for five years, and at\r\nlast at Plotzk, where he formed a firm friendship with another Bachur\r\n(student), by the name of Samuel Nasielsky, a native of Warsaw. They\r\nboth thirsted for knowledge and studied diligently. The other had one\r\nday to return home, on account of the illness of his mother, and Hirsch\r\nsoon followed him. In Warsaw they came in contact with the missionary\r\nIfland, who showed them another source of knowledge besides the Talmud,\r\nand which alone could satisfy not only their minds but also their souls.\r\nHaving read the New Testament, they were convinced that Jesus was their\r\nSaviour. They resolved now to go to Germany together. Before doing so\r\nthey met with a monk, who tried to win them for the Church of Rome and\r\nas they were not able to answer all his objections to Protestantism, the\r\nresult was, that they read the New Testament more diligently and\r\nearnestly. Hirsch was further instructed by Ifland, and was baptized in\r\nthe Reformed Church at Warsaw, by Superintendent Splasczynsky in 1864,\r\nwhen he received the name of Jedida (beloved of the Lord). His fervent\r\nprayer before his baptism is recorded, but it is too long to reproduce\r\nhere. His friend, who had hitherto been hindered by his family, now\r\njoined him, and they travelled together to Bromberg, where they were\r\nwelcomed by the missionary Koppel into his home at Salem. His parents\r\ncame to fetch him home, but he returned. Here Samuel was also further\r\ninstructed, but as Jedida got ill, he was sent to the Hospital Bethany\r\nat Berlin, and he followed him there, where he was baptized in 1866, and\r\nreceived the name of Luria, and very often visited his sick friend, to\r\nwhom he was attached, like David to Jonathan. But Jedida's earthly\r\npilgrimage now drew to a close, yet, before his departure, he composed a\r\nHebrew prayer as follows:--\"O Lord! watch over my bed when my end draws\r\nnear and my soul departeth. Stretch Thou forth Thy hands to receive and\r\nto bring it into Thy habitations. Place me among the heirs of Thy\r\nkingdom. Satisfy me with Thy comfort and salvation. Make me to rejoice\r\nin the light of Thy countenance, that I may ever live with Thee. Amen.\"\r\nThe Lord answered his prayer and gave him grace and strength to endure\r\nexcruciating bodily pains calmly and resignedly, and took him to\r\nHimself in September, 1867. His friend followed him three years later\r\nand was buried at his side.\r\n\r\nJERTES, Dr., known to the Rev. F. W. Becker, laboured with great\r\nblessing as a missionary at Frankfort-on-Main in 1838.\r\n\r\nJESAIA, Paul, an educated Jew of Prague, after showing an inclination\r\ntowards Christianity at home, went to London on business about the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century, where he came in contact with true\r\nChristians. The Jews being then few in number in the city, intercourse\r\nbetween them and Christians frequently took place on very friendly\r\nterms. In Bohemia there arose a false Messiah who deceived the people.\r\nOn his way to London, a Jesuit at Antwerp tried to convert him to Roman\r\nCatholicism. All this contributed to his searching for the truth, and\r\nwhen he found it in the English Church, he at once joined it by baptism.\r\nThen he wrote a treatise under the title, \"A Vindication of the\r\nChristian's Messiah,\" London, 1654. (Wolff, Bib. Heb. 4. N. 1811. d.)\r\n\r\nJOACHIM, Joseph, born in Kittsee, Hungary, 1831, is known to have\r\nembraced Christianity. He became a famous musician on the violin, and\r\nfounded a high school for music at Berlin in 1867.\r\n\r\nJOACHIMSTHAL, born in Goldberg, 1818, was baptized by Pastor Schultz in\r\nBerlin, 1842. He became eventually Professor of Mathematics in Berlin\r\nand in Halle. He died in 1861.\r\n\r\nJOHN, Evangelist, was one of those Jews baptized at Constantinople about\r\n1827-8, in the time of Wolff, when they were put in prison and\r\nbastinadoed.\r\n\r\nJOLBERG, Madam Regine Julie (_née_ Zimmerman), was born at\r\nFrankfort-on-Main in 1801. Her father was a wealthy man, and sent her at\r\nthe age of thirteen to a Christian school at Heidelberg, where she\r\nreceived good impressions. In 1821 she married a Jewish lawyer, named\r\nDr. Neustetel, and they settled at Hanau. There the seed sown in her\r\nheart at school began to spring forth, her husband too was influenced by\r\nher and by an evangelical pastor who visited him in his sickness, and he\r\nwished to be baptized, but died before he could realise his wish. She\r\ngave him a Christian burial. Subsequently, in 1826, she was baptized\r\nwith her children, and married her former teacher, S. Jolberg. Her\r\nsecond husband died three years later, and soon after the children she\r\nhad by him. Then she went to the village of Berg, near Stuttgart, in\r\n1831, with the two children of her first husband, and there her\r\nChristian faith was strengthened and deepened by the circle of Christian\r\nfriends around her. In 1841 she took a house at Leutsheim, where she\r\ninstructed children in knitting. This school became later an asylum for\r\npoor children. This was four years after enlarged to admit a branch for\r\nthe education of teachers. Six years later, in 1851, she hired a small\r\ncastle in Nonnenwier, with garden and woods, from Baron Bücklin, because\r\nshe had already eighty nurses under her instruction and supervision.\r\nThis institution prospered and became well known, so that her example\r\nwas followed in different parts of Germany and other countries. After 25\r\nyears labour there were 300 Nonnenwier sisters in Germany and abroad,\r\nand 260 nurses for children. She became known in Germany as Mutter\r\nJolberg, and rightly so, for indeed she was a mother in Israel.\r\n\r\nJOSEF, an artist, was baptized in Stockholm, 1832, through the preaching\r\nof the L.J.S. missionary Moritz.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH, H. S., was precentor in the synagogue at Bedford, where he heard\r\nthe Gospel. In 1829 he resigned his office and went to Norwich, where he\r\nwas baptized by the Rev. Samuel Titlow. He wrote afterwards: \"Reasons\r\nfor Renouncing Judaism and Embracing Christianity,\" Norwich, 1830. He\r\nstudied theology and was ordained in 1836 as minister or curate of St.\r\nSimon's Chapel, Liverpool. With the permission of the Bishop of Chester\r\nhe established a Hebrew service. It may be mentioned, too, that on the\r\nday of his ordination in Liverpool, six Jewish souls were baptized by\r\nthe Rev. H. Stewart, viz., Theodor Bernstein, and Joshua George Lazarus\r\nwith his wife and three children, and twelve others that year. In 1837\r\nJoseph became connected with L.J.S., from whom he received a grant. He\r\nwas the first, as far as we know, to open a home for enquirers, of which\r\nhe had the charge for many years.\r\n\r\nJOSEPHSON, Cornelius, was Flad's companion in the Gospel in Abyssinia.\r\n\r\nJOSEPHSON, Karl and Ludwig, two brothers, who were converted in\r\nWestphalia in the first half of the nineteenth century, and have given\r\nto the Church in Germany quite a number of theologians and pastors.\r\n\r\nJOSEPHSON, Van Reis, born at Stockholm in 1818, became a Christian\r\nwhilst at school. He then studied at the University of Upsala, and\r\ngraduated in 1842. Then he applied himself entirely to music, and became\r\nDirector of Music at the University. His compositions were popular in\r\nthe north, such as: \"Vart land,\" \"Rings Drapa,\" \"Islossning.\" His church\r\ncompositions have made him famous, e.g., his \"Kyrie,\" and his \"Quando\r\nCorpus.\"\r\n\r\nJOSHUA, was colporteur in Syria and in Asia Minor about 1860.\r\n\r\nJULIUS, Henrietta, sister of the physician Nicol Heinrich Julius,\r\nattended the Church of Dr. Routenberg in Hamburg, which caused her to\r\nembrace Christianity, and was baptized in 1820. Her brother became a\r\nRomanist, but lived with her in harmony. She wrote a German biography of\r\nElizabeth Fry.\r\n\r\nKAHN, David Isaac, a physician at Uhlefeld, called afterwards\r\n\"Christfreund,\" received Christian literature from the Mission at Halle,\r\nand this alone was the cause of his and his whole family embracing\r\nChristianity at Cadolzburg in 1739. The eldest son who still hesitated,\r\nwas baptized afterwards.\r\n\r\nKAHN, Rev. J., L.J.S. convert, graduated at Cambridge. After being\r\ncurate in various parishes and then Vicar of Bishopstone, Sussex, he\r\nbecame Vicar of St. Stephen's, Holloway, in 1884.\r\n\r\nKALKAR, Christian Andreas Herman, born November 27th, 1802, at\r\nStockholm, died at Gladsaxe, February 3rd, 1886. He received his early\r\neducation from his father, who was a rabbi and a member of the\r\nconsistorium, and at the schools of Copenhagen, where, in 1818, he\r\nbecame a student of law. In 1823 he embraced the evangelical faith and\r\nstudied theology, passing his examination in 1826. After being teacher\r\nat Oldensee, from 1827 to 1841, he travelled in Spain, and was appointed\r\nminister at Gladsaxe and Herloi in 1844. Among Kalkar's many works may\r\nbe mentioned--\"Evangelische Missionsgeschichte,\" 1857; \"Geschichte der\r\nRömisch-Katholischen Mission,\" 1862 (German translation, Erlangen,\r\n1869); \"Geschichte der Christlichen Mission unter den Heiden,\" 1877\r\n(German translation, Gütersloh, 1879); \"Die Mission unter den Juden,\"\r\n1868 (German translation, Hamburg, 1869); \"Israel og Kerken,\"\r\nCopenhagen, 1881. From 1871 to 1880 Kalkar was editor of the \"Theologisk\r\nTidskrift.\"\r\n\r\nKALORIA, Rev. John B., a native of Jerusalem when he for the first time\r\nheard the Gospel from the L.J.S. missionaries. After his conversion he\r\nstudied at Basel, and was then sent out to Uruguay as pastor and teacher\r\nin a German Colony there. About 1887, he assisted Mr. Eppstein in\r\nLondon, and then went to the United States, where he became engaged in\r\nMinisterial work, contributing valuable articles to the Jewish\r\nMissionary periodical at New York, \"The People, the Land and the Book.\"\r\n\r\nKAMERAS, Rev. Nathanael, missionary in Vienna, of the British Society\r\nfor the Propagation of the Gospel among the Jews. The following is an\r\nabridged extract from his autobiography:--\r\n\r\n\"On the road leading from Russian Lithuania to Russian Poland there\r\nstands a large and lonely inn. It was there that I first saw the light\r\nof day in the year 1862. A clay-floored entrance divides the rooms of\r\nthis extensive house into two rows; on one side are the rooms for the\r\nstrangers, who lodge here over night, the large tap-room, and the small\r\nrooms belonging to my parents; on the other, a one-windowed chamber,\r\nwhere our teacher slept, and the hall, a pretty large room, set apart\r\nfor prayer and study. It contained long narrow tables and forms, an\r\nornamented cupboard on the eastern side, in which the Thora-rollen (law\r\nscrolls) were kept, a prayer-desk with a seven-branched brass candelabra\r\nand a hanging lamp. The male members of our family, and Jews from the\r\nneighbouring villages, assembled there for Divine Service, to which the\r\nwomen listened in an adjoining room. There, too, our teacher instructed\r\nmy four brothers and myself in the Hebrew language, and in the Talmud.\r\nAs soon as I was five years of age, my parents, wrapping me up in a\r\nTallith (prayer-mantle), solemnly brought me in there, in order that I\r\nmight receive the necessary instruction; so that from that moment I\r\ndevoted myself exclusively to study. Every other occupation, every other\r\nemployment, every recreation, game, or fun of childhood, all that makes\r\nthe heart light and the body strong, was banished from my life. I felt\r\nlike a bird imprisoned in a cage, and debarred the free movement of its\r\nlimbs; outside, was the world in all its beauty, where numbers of joyous\r\ncreatures were flying about in the full enjoyment of their individual\r\nfreedom, whilst I, powerless, clung to the bars. Before my eyes lay a\r\nlandscape, rich in rural splendour; as far as I could see, village after\r\nvillage, surrounded by fruit-laden trees, presented a most cheerful\r\naspect, and from the window I could watch the Christian children at\r\ntheir play, enjoying the fresh air of freedom in the flowering fields\r\nand sprouting meadows. Amidst the songs of birds, the rustling of leaves\r\nand the roar of the forest, I caught the sound of happy human voices,\r\nwhilst I, chained to my books all day and until late at night, was\r\nforced to pore over marriage contracts and divorces and other similar\r\nthings, which would have been better kept from my childish reason. 'Oh,\r\nif I were only that poor farm-servant coming home from the fields with\r\nthe tired horses, or that ragged boy driving his cows home!' Thus I\r\nsighed. But all my longings and wishings were useless; I had to go over\r\nthe same tiresome road that all the Jewish children of orthodox parents\r\nmust labour through. The master behind me, drove me on with a volume in\r\none hand and the rod in the other; my father drove me, my relations\r\ndrove me, and thus, without rest or quiet, I was hurried through all\r\nthose voluminous works that are of no value for practical existence\r\nwhatever, so that the years of my childhood passed by, joyless and\r\nunenjoyed.\r\n\r\n\"This Jewish elementary school, called Cheder, seemed to me just like a\r\nprison, and the teacher, who bore the title of Melamed, I looked upon as\r\na jailer, so that when the news reached me of my parents' resolve to\r\nsend me to a Yeschiva, I welcomed it with the same joy with which a\r\nconvict welcomes his acquittal after long and hard imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\"It was not difficult to find a suitable Talmud school for me. The\r\nson-in-law of our district Rabbi was Rosh-Yeshiva (professor at a Talmud\r\ncollege) in a town where an uncle of mine lived. Thither my parents sent\r\nme shortly after I had been confirmed (Bar mitzvah), that is to say,\r\nwhen I had completed my thirteenth year. There, in his private lodgings,\r\nI visited Rabbi Schimele Wolf, for so the Talmud lecturer was called,\r\nand begged him to accept me as a pupil. At first he received me very\r\ncoldly, and with dignity that involuntarily pointed to the importance of\r\nhis position, but after I had delivered the recommendations I brought\r\nfrom his father-in-law, and had told him that his family doctor was my\r\nuncle, the stern look in his coal-black, thoughtful eyes, that shone\r\nlike two glowing specks out of his pale face, fringed by a black beard,\r\nrelaxed, and with extreme friendliness, he dispensed with the usual\r\nexamination on entrance, and ordered his servant to lead me to the\r\nYeshiva, and assign me a place there. We were still at a considerable\r\ndistance from our destination when a great noise of human voices broke\r\non my ear, and when at last I entered the hall, in which the Yeshiva was\r\nheld, I was quite stunned by the terrific noise that was being made\r\nthere. More than a hundred boys, youths of about thirteen to twenty\r\nyears of age, were assembled, each one screaming and moving about in\r\nunrestrained restlessness. Some of them were sitting round long, narrow\r\ntables, continually swaying the upper part of their bodies backwards\r\nand forwards or from side to side. Others were standing in front of\r\nsmall portable desks, leaning over them or swaying to and fro with them,\r\nor going round and round them. Each boy had a ponderous volume open\r\nbefore him, from which he chose a passage, that he quoted at the top of\r\nhis voice. One roared like a lion, 'Omar Rabbi Akiwa (Rabbi Akiwa said)\r\nsa......id, sa......id ..Ra......bbi...A......ki......wa..., oi Mamuni\r\n(Oh Mammy) Rabbi, oi Tatutim, (Oh Daddy) Akiwa, oi Ribene schel olam (Oh\r\nLord of the World) said; said Rabbi Akiwa; what did Rabbi Akiwa say? A\r\n...ki....wa...sa......id...,' and so on for hours. Another sang very\r\ndaintily, imitating the voice of the chanter in sad and joyful melodies,\r\nsuch as had remained in his memory from the various festivals, or he\r\ncomposed something at will, with the following words; 'According to the\r\ndoctrine of Samai it is permitted to eat an egg that has been laid on a\r\nholiday on that same day, whereas according to the doctrine of Hillel,\r\nit is forbidden.' My arrival attracted their attention and had a\r\nsubduing effect; there was a lull. Suddenly a voice cried: 'The\r\nMassgiach (overseer) is coming.' This was uttered in the same sing-song\r\nmanner, as though the boy were studying some sentence out of the Talmud.\r\nIt was repeated by a second, then a third and a fourth in the same\r\nmanner, and was the signal for them all of one accord to begin their\r\nlamentations and singing afresh, with increased vigour, endeavouring to\r\ndrown each other's voices. It is in this way that these pale boys and\r\nyouths prepare for the 'Schir' (lecture), which lasts from two to four\r\no'clock in the afternoon, taking place daily, and being carried out in\r\nthe following manner:--The scholars stood round in a semi-circle at the\r\nfeet of the Rabbi, who sat on an elevated chair at a desk. Charging one\r\npupil to read a certain passage out of the Talmud, he desired another to\r\nread the commentaries to it, and again a third to read and explain the\r\nmarginal notes to those commentaries.\r\n\r\n\"In the quiet cloisters of a large town I met a lonely man, living one\r\nday like another, a quiet and edifying life, to whom I felt particularly\r\nattracted. His head was a real study; a long white beard covered his\r\nbreast, and he had a high, broad forehead, a finely arched nose, and\r\nlarge blue eyes, in which a whole world of goodness lay; over his\r\nfeatures there was an expression of touching humility, as though he\r\nwould excuse himself to everyone for daring to breathe the air and to\r\nfill a space in the universe. Hoping that with him I should not fare\r\nbadly, I settled down there, and indeed, I did not regret it. From the\r\nbeginning he showed me his goodwill in unlimited measure, taking care\r\nthat I should receive free board from the prayer-men, who assembled\r\nthere three times a day, and in such wise that I boarded with a\r\ndifferent one each day in the week; besides which he contrived to give\r\nme ample pocket-money. I was often allowed to substitute him in reading\r\n'Mischnais for anniversaries' (extracts from the Talmud to be read for\r\nthe departed souls on the respective days of their death, which the\r\nrelations generally remunerate well). He took me with him wherever he\r\nwas called to sing psalms or say prayers, either at the cradle of a\r\nnew-born child that had scarcely opened its eyes to the light, or at the\r\nbedside of the dying, closing them to the light, to a wedding-feast or\r\nto a death-watch, and everywhere money poured in. Thus we lived together\r\nday and night in a neighbourly, friendly manner in the cloisters, and\r\nnothing lay further in the recluse's thoughts than that he should rob me\r\nof my peace of mind, which, however, he did without wishing to do so.\r\nHis fervent prayers for the redemption of the people of Israel it was\r\nthat had such a striking effect on my mind. Years will not efface from\r\nmy memory the sight of that old man at midnight, when all around was\r\nquiet, and he thought himself unobserved, taking off his shoes and\r\nseating himself on the floor, imploring the Lord in heartfelt sincerity,\r\nin His mercy to return to Jerusalem and reign there as He had\r\nprophesied. I still hear those heart-rending tones, in which he prayed;\r\n'Stretch out Thy right hand, Oh God! and in mercy redeem the people of\r\nIsrael. Oh, that it might soon be announced to the unhappy nation: \"Your\r\nRedeemer has come to Zion!\"' Every sentence was accompanied by a sigh or\r\nbroken by a sob. He imagined me to be asleep, but I heard every word,\r\nand was often moved to tears, involuntarily beginning myself to pray\r\neagerly and perseveringly that the Messiah might soon come and release\r\nHis people from captivity. From henceforth I devoted much thought to the\r\nsubject, and, in my childish fancy, pictured to myself how glorious it\r\nwould be when the Messiah would come, and, as a child rejoices to greet\r\nits father from afar, I looked forward, daily and hourly, to the advent\r\nof the Redeemer of Israel. On the other hand, the question often worried\r\nme; Why does not God answer such real and fervent prayers? Why does not\r\nthe Messiah come to release His people? I did not dare to speak to Rabbi\r\nTodresch, such was the name of the recluse, on the subject, but once\r\nwhen a Talmudist from some well-known Talmud school came back to his\r\nhome in the cloisters, I told him what it was that troubled me so much,\r\nand my astonishment was indeed great when I heard his answer: 'Prayers\r\nsuch as those will and can never be answered; for the Messiah has come.'\r\nIn vain did I beg him to explain it to me, but he purposely avoided all\r\nmy questions, telling me only so much that he possessed a book which\r\nexplained the question thoroughly, but which he could not entrust to me\r\nfor fear of the consequences such a step might have for himself;\r\nbesides, it would be of no use to me, as I should have to give up my\r\npresent career entirely. 'If you want to know the full truth,' he said\r\nto me, 'you must go abroad, for only there can you search after the\r\ntruth freely and independently; whereas here, you must sell your freedom\r\nfor your bread.' Tortured by restlessness, despair and longing, and\r\nfearful lest my parents should get ear of the change in my heart, when\r\nthey would certainly oppose my plans, I decided to follow his advice at\r\nonce and to leave Russia.\r\n\r\n\"After taking a hearty leave of the recluse, and my new friend, the\r\nTalmud student, I seized my staff and went out into the wide world, a\r\ntoy for wind and weather. Like a nomad, I wandered uncertain, for a long\r\nperiod, from town to town and from village to village. It was quite late\r\noften when I reached a strange place; all the doors and gates were\r\nclosed, and I turned my steps to the ever open house of God, entered\r\nupon a 'Kasche' (a Talmudic question of dispute) with any one of those\r\npresent, and I immediately felt at home, had my board and lodging, and\r\nthe pious prayer-men, who came there daily, openly and secretly pressed\r\ntheir charitable gifts into my hand. Thus I was enabled to wander\r\nthrough the whole of Russia to the frontier, which, having no passport,\r\nI could not legally cross, and was therefore forced to smuggle myself\r\nthrough by giving a man a rouble to conduct me through a wood which led\r\ninto Germany. Now that I was in another country, my position became a\r\ndifferent one. On reaching the first German town, I asked as usual for\r\nthe 'Beth-Hamedrash' (Jewish prayer and school-house), but to my\r\ngreatest dismay no one could give me any information. Only one thing I\r\nwas aware of, and that was that I could not make myself understood at\r\nall. It was evening; the first stars, those companions of my wanderings,\r\nbegan to twinkle in the sky, but into my sad heart no light would enter;\r\nthere all was dark and dull. Here I was, standing at the corner of a\r\nstreet leaning against a post, a little bundle in my hand, without\r\nmeans, work, knowledge or language; alone, forsaken, not knowing where\r\nto turn. A lady passing by stopped and looked at me inquisitively. The\r\nsight of a slender little lad, clothed in the long wide Kaftan, with a\r\npale face and sad eyes filled with tears, must have aroused her\r\nsympathy. She addressed me, but finding I did not understand a word she\r\nsaid, she gave me a few pence and showed me an inn where I could pass\r\nthe night. It was certainly a very cheap night's-lodging that I had, but\r\nI was obliged to sleep amongst tipsy room-companions, to whom I was much\r\ntoo interesting a personage for them to leave in peace. Some would\r\ninsist on making a common covering of my long coat; others played\r\nincessantly with my long fore-locks, whilst others again were interested\r\nin my Arba-Kanfoth (a garment with fringe at the ends) and were\r\ncontinually pulling at them. It was a long, weary night that I passed\r\nthere, and as soon as the rising sun shone faintly through the dirty\r\nwindow-panes I hastened out, and, being once more alone, allowed my\r\ntears to flow. For the first time since my departure home-sickness with\r\nall its overwhelming power quite overcame me, and I felt the seriousness\r\nof life in its full meaning. However, I soon took courage again, laid my\r\nTephillin (prayer-strap) on and implored the Lord to lend me His\r\nassistance and protection, taking a solemn oath that from henceforth I\r\nwould blindly let myself be guided by Him in all things. With this\r\nsacred oath and with the firm conviction that the Lord would carry out\r\nall to His glory, I went on my way. With great difficulty and many\r\nprivations I reached Breslau, where I met a man from Russia, who\r\nassisted me in obtaining a place as instructor of the Hebrew language in\r\na Polish Jew's family. After staying there a few months I seemed,\r\ncuriously enough, to be drawn as by an invisible hand towards Vienna.\r\nThe money I had earned as a teacher amply sufficed to take me there, and\r\nafter a lengthy search, I found inexpensive lodgings in a Jewish family.\r\n(The head of the family is dead, but the wife still lives here, and her\r\nson is now, thanks be to God, a dear believing Protestant Christian.)\r\nHere I became acquainted with a Jewish shoemaker, who was the first to\r\ngive me a New Testament in the Hebrew language to read. The very first\r\nsentence in that book was sufficient to draw me to it like a magnet, for\r\nthere it was written what that Talmud-scholar had briefly told me,\r\nwritten clearly and in full, namely, that the Messiah, who until now had\r\nbeen the object of my prayers, my desires and hopes, had actually been\r\nborn. On asking him to tell me something more about the book, the\r\nshoemaker conducted me to the missionary, Herr E. Weiss, who advised me\r\nto go to Pastor Schönberger, preacher at Prague, where I found a very\r\nfriendly welcome. I passed the winter there, but, as Pastor Schönberger\r\nwas obliged to be away for a year, he took me to his friend, the Rev. D.\r\nA. Hefter, L.J.S. missionary at Frankfort-on-the-Main, who kindly took\r\nme under his paternal care.\r\n\r\n\"The year 1881 was a decisive one for me. The Word of Life rooted itself\r\ndeeper and deeper in my heart; prejudices vanished one by one, and the\r\nlove of Jesus took their place. I perceived how deeply my heart had been\r\nwounded by sin; but at the same time I acknowledged the most lovable of\r\nall the children of the earth, the Son of God, who has redeemed me too\r\nthrough the shedding of His innocent blood, and has healed all my\r\nwounds. On the 14th of August, 1881, I was baptized by the missionary,\r\nHerr Hefter, in the 'Dreikönigskirche' at Frankfort-on-the-Main,\r\nreceiving the names Nathanael Karl Albert. At first I learnt the art of\r\nbookbinding in Frankfort, but as the Rev. D. A. Hefter desired me to\r\nbecome a pupil at the missionary-house in Barmen, I complied with his\r\ndesire most willingly, regarding this step as one indicated by the Lord.\r\nOne year I passed in the preparatory-school of the missionary-house, and\r\nfour years in the seminary itself. During these years I received\r\nabundant blessings from the Lord. I was led deeper and deeper into the\r\nSpirit of the Word of God, and guided to more independent search by\r\nteachers endowed with truly divine minds, and treated with the greatest\r\naffection by a friendly circle of brethren, among whom I was permitted,\r\nthanks be to God, to grow stronger in faith, more fervent in love, and\r\nriper in understanding. To serve the Lord in His empire, and to win\r\nsouls for Him out of His ancient people of the covenant, was my most\r\ncoveted desire, and this too the Lord has granted me in His endless\r\ngoodness and mercy. At the end of the year 1887 I passed my final\r\nexaminations, and at the beginning of 1888, in answer to the proposal of\r\nthe British Society for the Propagation of the Gospel among the Jews, I\r\nwas permitted to begin my active duty among Israel in Vienna. Three\r\nyears later, in 1891, I received my ordination from the celebrated\r\ntheologian of Würtemberg, Dr. Burk, in Stuttgart.\r\n\r\n\"One incontestible certainty has been proved to me both in the wonderful\r\nguidance of my life as also in my profession, which I now hold for more\r\nthan sixteen years, that of myself I can do nothing, not even the\r\nslightest thing, and imbued with the conviction of my powerlessness and\r\nutter helplessness, of my own poverty and wretchedness, I have learnt to\r\nmake use of the sweetest privilege of our life, namely, the subjection\r\nof my own will to the will of my Saviour, Jesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\nKAUFMANN, Rev. Moritz, T.C.D., a native of Germany, convert and student\r\nof the L.J.S. about 1860, was ordained Deacon in London, 1865; priest in\r\nthe diocese of Meath, 1869. He held two livings in Ireland, was\r\nLecturer, Tutor, and Assistant Chaplain of St. Aidan's College,\r\nBirkenhead, from 1877 to 1883. In 1884 he was appointed Vicar of\r\nErpingham, and afterward Rector of Ingworth, Norfolk. Dr. Kaufmann\r\nobtained the prize for Hebrew, Chaldaic and Syriac, and is the author of\r\nthe following works: \"Socialism, its Nature, its Dangers, and its\r\nRemedies Considered,\" 1874; \"Utopias, or Schemes for Social Improvement\r\nfrom Sir Thomas More to Karl Marx,\" 1879; \"Christian Socialism,\" 1888;\r\n\"Charles Kingsley, Christian Socialist and Reformer,\" 1892; \"Socialism\r\nand Modern Thought,\" 1895.\r\n\r\nKAUTZ, Christian Friedrich, baptized in Berlin, 1702, published in 1703\r\n\"Des 12 jährigen Jesu vom Nazareth Verstand im Fragen und antworten,\r\ndarüber sich die juden verwundern,\" also \"Erkannte Göttliche Wahrheit\r\naus der Schrift Alten und Neuen Testamentes,\" Waldenburg, 1716, and a\r\n\"Catechismus für Juden,\" 1720.\r\n\r\nKEYPER, a native of Prague, was Rabbi in Schleusinger, where he was\r\nconverted and baptized by Superintendent Friedrich Ernest Weis in 1715.\r\nHe afterwards was lecturer on Jewish antiquities in Altorf and in\r\nRegensburg. Later he gave lessons in Talmud and Rabbinics at Bremen.\r\nWolff in Bib. Heb. 3, 4, N. 1356 b. speaks of him as a learned, upright\r\nand sincere man.\r\n\r\nKIEL, a physician from Roumania, made, as a pious Jew a pilgrimage to\r\nJerusalem, thinking that in the Holy City he would find spiritual\r\nsatisfaction and peace, but he did not find it in the Judaism that he\r\nfound there, but in the Gospel which was preached by the missionaries.\r\nHe and his wife were baptized by Bishop Alexander in 1844, and he\r\nlaboured afterwards as a medical missionary in Safed.\r\n\r\nKLEIN, Julius Leopold, a native of Hungary, born at Nocskolez, 1810,\r\ndied in Berlin, 1810. He was a physician, poet and writer. His works\r\nappeared in seven volumes, under the title \"Dramatische werke,\" Leipsic,\r\n1871-2.\r\n\r\nKÖBNER, Pastor Julius, was born in Denmark in 1806. Was by profession an\r\noptician like Spinoza, but God vouchsafed to him greater spiritual sight\r\nthan to the philosopher. He embraced Christian faith in the Lutheran\r\nChurch of which he became a minister, but afterwards joined the\r\nBaptists. Endowed with spiritual and mental gifts, he henceforth\r\nlaboured with great zeal in Copenhagen, where he built the Christian\r\nChapel, and also in many other parts. Later he laboured in Berlin, where\r\nhe died 1884. His notable writings are, \"Das Lied von Gott,\" an epic\r\npoem from the creation to the redemption of the world. \"Die Waldenser,\"\r\na dramatic poem with notes, \"Die Neue Erde.\" On his hundredth birthday,\r\n1906, appeared a hundred of his choicest sermons in the press, under the\r\ntitle \"Lebens Wasser.\"\r\n\r\nKOFLER, Carl, born in Lemberg, 1820, was baptized with his parents at\r\nBreslau in 1822, graduated at the University there, and was appointed\r\nVicar in Bad Lardeck in Silesia in 1851. He is recorded to have been a\r\ngifted preacher of the Gospel and a conscientious pastor. He died in\r\n1877.\r\n\r\nKOPPEL, Dr. J., born in the Archduchy of Posen in 1830. He began to\r\nlearn Hebrew when he was three years old. Afterwards he attended a Roman\r\nCatholic school, where he was badly treated, and he imbibed strong\r\nprejudices against Christianity. In 1846 he entered a Jewish seminary\r\nfor teachers at Bromberg, and when he finished his studies, he was\r\nappointed teacher by the Government in a town near the Russian border,\r\nand also interpreter. At that time he realised that there was a great\r\ncontrast between the Bible and the Talmud, but he had no inclination\r\ntowards Christianity whatever. Coming to Berlin, he made the\r\nacquaintance of Dr. Jaffe, whose brother was a missionary of the British\r\nSociety, and he advised him to go to him for Christian instruction. The\r\nresult was that he was baptized by Jaffe. In 1860, Koppel entered the\r\nservice of the British Society, and laboured at first in England. In\r\nBristol he became acquainted with George Müller and with his\r\ninstitution, which served him to good purpose in his future activity.\r\nReturning the same year to Bromberg, it happened that one day a pair of\r\nboots were stolen from him, and a poor beggar boy was suspected of the\r\ntheft. This incident awakened in Koppel's heart deep compassion towards\r\nthe poor neglected boys, and he applied to the municipal authorities for\r\npermission to found a Home or Ragged School for them where they might\r\nreceive Christian training. This permission was, after some hesitation,\r\ngranted, and the Home was opened in 1864, which served at the same time\r\nas a refuge for gutter children, orphans, Jewish enquirers and converts.\r\nKoppel then displayed great activity together with Dr. Ben Zion, Dr.\r\nMossa and other friends whom he gathered around him. They instructed the\r\nchildren, visited the prisons, preached to the Jews, of whom thirty-five\r\nwere converted there. Koppel laboured in faith, and the means of support\r\nwere not wanting. A waiter sent him 200 thaler and rich people helped\r\nhim liberally. In 1866 there were seventy inmates in the \"Home\" at\r\nSalem. In 1869 Koppel, not feeling strong enough to carry on the work,\r\ndelivered it to others and went to London, where he did similar work and\r\nwas well known at the Mildmay Conference Hall. Subsequently he went to\r\nTexas to found a colony there.\r\n\r\nKRONHEIM, Joseph Nathaniel, a native of Magdeburg and son of wealthy\r\nparents. In his youth he led a restless life, served as a soldier under\r\nNapoleon I. in his Russian campaign, and then was schoolmaster in\r\nMagdeburg, where he bought a New Testament, to teach moral principles\r\nfrom it. The rabbi, on hearing of this, dissolved the school. He then\r\ncame to England and made the acquaintance of Bishop Alexander, who\r\npreached the Gospel to him. He then took more time to investigate the\r\nquestion at issue between Judaism and Christianity, travelling in the\r\ncountry to sell optical instruments, till he came to the Rev. Wyndham\r\nMadden, of Woodhouse Parsonage, near Huddersfield, by whom he was\r\nfurther instructed and baptized in 1832. In 1835 he settled as optician\r\nin Belfast. A year later the friends of the Jews there, observing his\r\nChristian character, ability, and great Biblical knowledge, asked him to\r\ngive up his business and become an agent of the Belfast Auxiliary\r\nSociety, which he did, though he was then sixty years old. Through him a\r\nlively interest was awakened in Ireland for the cause of missions among\r\nthe Jews. He laboured there for seventeen years, and died in 1852.\r\n\r\nKRÖNIG, Rev. Joshua Charles Solomon, heard the Gospel in Paris from the\r\nL.J.S. missionary Markheim, and was baptized by him in 1857, in the\r\nchapel of Lewis Way, when Lord Shaftesbury was one of the sponsors.\r\nAfter doing good work in London as a city missionary, he studied\r\ntheology at King's College, was ordained by the Archbishop of York,\r\n1871-1872, and was appointed by trustees to the Vicarage of St.\r\nBarnabas, Hull, where he laboured for the rest of his life as a faithful\r\nminister of the Gospel to his congregation and missionary to his own\r\npeople, esteemed and beloved by them both. In 1875 he opened a\r\nreading-room for Jews, which he called a \"Beth hamedrash,\" in which he\r\nplaced one of his own converts as house-father. In 1881 he bought a\r\nhouse for this purpose, on which he placed the inscription, \"The doors\r\nof Zion, house for studying God's Word.\" In 1884, he told a pathetic\r\nstory of a Jew who was a blasphemer, but whom the power of the Gospel\r\nconverted and regenerated, so that he became his assistant in the work\r\nof the mission. Krönig was much sought after as a deputation.\r\n\r\nKROPVELD, Rev. E., Pastor at Ablasserdam in Holland and Secretary of the\r\nDutch Reformed Church Mission to the Jews. He was brought up in strict\r\nJewish orthodoxy. Starting in life in a merchant's office and living\r\ncarelessly, he one day had a conversation with a Christian peasant, who\r\nassured him that he was certain of entering at last into the heavenly\r\nCanaan. This made a deep impression upon him, and he began to live in\r\nstricter conformity with Judaism. At the age of seventeen he heard the\r\nL.J.S. missionary Pauli preach, and felt the power of the Gospel\r\nmessage, which led to his being baptized. He then became a colporteur of\r\nreligious books, when he suffered much from his friends, yet lived so\r\neconomically that he managed to save sufficient money to enable him to\r\nstudy for the ministry. He then became Pastor in Rundem, Minnertsga,\r\nand at last in Ablasserdam. He wrote several books in relation to the\r\nJews.\r\n\r\nKUH, Christian Daniel, a merchant in Breslau, having been convinced of\r\nthe truth of Christianity, was baptized in the Evangelical Church at\r\nBreslau in 1805. The result was that his wife and three children, his\r\nbrother-in-law Hans August Fisher, and his fiancée followed his example.\r\n\r\nKUNERT, Rev. Karl, was born on May 25th, 1870, at Krotoschin, in Posen,\r\none of the Prussian provinces. Of his history he says:--\"My father was a\r\nfurrier, who, in the family of his grandfather, a rabbi at Breslau,\r\nreceived not only the usual superficial knowledge of Judaism, but at the\r\nsame time a truly orthodox education, and, as a pious Jew, he took good\r\ncare that the laws of his people should be strictly kept by his whole\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\"I was named Karl, after this great grandfather, and I was expected to\r\nfollow his profession likewise. As far as I can remember, I assisted at\r\nDivine service every morning and evening from about the third year of my\r\nlife, and from the age of four I joined in the prayers whenever they\r\nwere offered. Nor were the other branches of my education in any way\r\nneglected. Being able to read and write when quite a little boy of five,\r\nI became well versed in the history of my people and country. When nine\r\nyears of age I was sent to the college of my native town, and later on,\r\nwhen my parents removed to Breslau, I visited the Catholic college of\r\nthat town, but at the same time the Jewish school. It was at this\r\nperiod of my life that I got a very strong antipathy to Christ and His\r\nadherents. Is that to be wondered at? All I saw was the thoughtless\r\nworship of Popish idols. And then, the greater evil to my young soul was\r\nwrought by my fellow-pupils, who, though educated in the Catholic faith,\r\nnevertheless found much pleasure in laughing at each new thought or\r\nreligious exercise, and spent much time in reading all kinds of immoral\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\n\"I was very fond of reading, and in the memorable year 1885, the Lord\r\nled me to purchase the New Testament. There was a certain sacristan at\r\nBreslau who sold the books and tracts of the British and Foreign Bible\r\nSociety, and often on Sundays, about dinner time, I went to see him and\r\nto buy books to read. In this way I came into possession of the New\r\nTestament in Greek, German and French. But the sacristan never uttered a\r\nword in favour of the Gospel, and I thought him a very greedy man who\r\nsold Christian books for the only purpose of gaining money. Such\r\nbehaviour in a professing Christian, together with the sad experiences\r\nin my school-time, made me an embittered enemy of Christ and His Church.\r\nDuring my time at college I visited the University and the Rabbinic\r\nSeminary, in order to prepare myself for the chosen profession of a\r\nRabbi. The bitter hatred of all who confessed Christ grew more and more\r\nintense, and at last, I triumphantly delivered a public lecture at\r\nBerlin against Christianity.\r\n\r\n\"But already, at the time of my visiting the Rabbinic Seminary, I felt\r\nan inner restlessness, and even when I changed theological studies for\r\nother pursuits, this uneasiness would not quit me. I used to perform the\r\nJewish law with a still greater zeal, notwithstanding that the inner\r\nvoice told me most distinctly that I was wrong and would never find true\r\nhappiness in this way. I could speak to no one about this conflict of my\r\nsoul. The Jews did not understand me, and Christian people I most\r\nheartily despised.\r\n\r\n\"I then resolved to go to Paris, firmly believing that new surroundings\r\nwould restore my peace of mind, and I felt I must conquer the heartfelt\r\nunrest at any rate. But on the very day of my arrival in Paris I took\r\nthe train for Antwerp, and the next morning found me wandering about the\r\nstreets of that town in dread despair. At length I resolved to return\r\nhome, and that once more at Berlin I would seek rest in work. But in\r\nvain. I wandered under the old trees of the Tiergarten for long hours\r\nwrestling with my God, whom I was willing to serve, but after my own\r\nfashion as a Jew. I would not yield, and though I was hardly able to\r\nbear this inward conflict longer, I still went on with praying in public\r\non the Day of Atonement.\r\n\r\n\"At the close of November, 1898, my anxiety grew so strong that I\r\nresolved to start for Altona, in order to be thoroughly instructed about\r\nChristianity, in a mission house. Nobody had told me of such an\r\ninstitution, but by chance I learned of its existence from one of its\r\nformer inmates. The 26th of November, 1898, found me at Hamburg. But\r\nstill the old Adam would not yield, and I never entered the mission\r\nhouse till the utmost need forced me to go and see the Rev. A. Frank. He\r\nreceived me most kindly, and was willing to give me shelter in the\r\nhouse, but told me that, like all other inmates, I would have to engage\r\nin manual labour. I most gladly agreed to this, and I became a pupil of\r\nthe mission on December 1st.\r\n\r\n\"Far from the noise and influence of the world I first met my Saviour in\r\nall His glory. There was no question now about justification by\r\nperforming Moses' laws; His light made me see my sins in all their\r\nawfulness, and I broke down crying, 'My punishment is greater than I can\r\nbear' (Gen. iv. 13). But soon Divine love made me sing, 'My life is\r\npreserved' (Gen. xxxii. 30), and all my heart went out to my Saviour who\r\nhad done so much for me. I was baptized on April 23rd by Pastor Aston.\r\nFor a short time after I stayed at Hamburg as a private teacher, and the\r\nLord's blessing was with me; but I was soon asked by our dear Pastor\r\nDworkowicz if I would be willing to work as missionary to the Jews, and\r\nhe felt I might be of service at Königsberg. Circumstances at the\r\nbeginning of 1901 made my way clear. I knew then that it was after my\r\nSaviour's will that I should enter upon this work; so I applied to the\r\nBritish Society for the Propagation of the Gospel among the Jews, and I\r\nwas accepted on June 9th, on the recommendation of Pastors Dworkowicz,\r\nAston and Frank, of Hamburg. I commenced work there under the direction\r\nof the first named, but on March 15, 1902, I started for Königsberg, in\r\norder to labour in that city for the glory of God my Saviour. 'The Lord\r\nhath done great things for us, whereof we are glad' (Ps. cxxvi. 3).\"\r\n\r\nLANDSMAN, Daniel, was living in Jerusalem about 1870, maintaining\r\nhimself by his handiwork as a strict, pious Jew. Whenever the L.J.S.\r\nmissionary Stern met him he used to preach Christ crucified to him, so\r\nthat at last he, in a passion, assaulted Stern violently, but at length\r\nwas conquered by the Gospel, and then became his best friend. After his\r\nbaptism in the Holy City he witnessed for Christ there before the Jews\r\nfor some time. Then a position as assistant missionary was offered him\r\nin the Scotch Presbyterian mission at Constantinople, where he zealously\r\nlaboured for seventeen years, and Bassin, afterward a missionary was one\r\nof those in whose conversion he was instrumental. He then emigrated to\r\nthe United States, and was appointed by the Lutheran Synod at Missouri\r\nas missionary in New York about 1883, where he was blessed in his\r\nefforts to win souls for the Kingdom of God. He wrote the following\r\ntracts, partly in Hebrew and Yiddish, \"Jeshua Sar ha Panim\"; \"Jeshua ha\r\nNozri ist der Messiah Emeth,\" \"Memra,\" \"Shabbath Feiertage und\r\nBeschneidung\"; \"Was sagen die Rabbinere über Maschiah\"; \"Was sagt die\r\nKabbalah, &c., über die Dreieinigkeit Gottes,\" 1888.\r\n\r\nLASERON, Dr. Michael Maximilian August Heinrich, born in Königsberg,\r\n1819, died in London, 1894. His father was a rabbi, but died on the same\r\nday, as his mother, when he was only seven years old. Laseron was then\r\nbrought up by bigoted relations, who were not very kind to him. Owing to\r\nthis he had no great love for the Jews, but rather sought after\r\nChristians, from whom he learned to know the Lord Jesus as his Saviour.\r\nHe did not conceal his convictions, but told his relatives that he had a\r\ndesire to become a Christian. Thereupon they so illtreated him that his\r\nlife was in danger; so when he was seventeen, he escaped on foot to\r\nFrankfort, enduring great hardship on the way. Then he was instructed\r\nand baptized by Pastor Keimers, but he could not remain in Frankfort on\r\naccount of persecution by the Jews, so he went to Basel. Scarcely had he\r\narrived there, when he got very ill, and the wife of the missionary, a\r\nlady by the name of Haslen, nursed him till he recovered. Friends in\r\nSwitzerland recommended him to the L.J.S., and he was for a time in the\r\nOperative Jewish Converts' Institution, Palestine Place. Then he entered\r\nas a student the newly-founded Missionary Training College of the\r\nBritish Jews' Society, and remained there over two years. However,\r\nthough he was interested in the Jewish mission, and took practical part\r\nin the same, yet he felt that he was called to be a medical man, and the\r\nCommittee allowed him to leave in 1849. Thereupon he went to Erlangen\r\nand studied medicine, and at the same time practised homoeopathy\r\nprivately. Laseron then returned to London, and was a successful\r\npractitioner. Settling at Edmonton in 1854, he there lost his eldest\r\nchild. This was the occasion for a call to a great enterprise of faith\r\nwhich bore glorious fruit. The bereaved parents noticing in the street\r\npoor, half-starved children, resorted to prayer and then resolved to\r\nestablish an asylum for poor children where they could receive a good\r\neducation. An Irish lady hearing of it, sent him £3; with this\r\nencouragement he hired a house, appointed a teacher, and opened the\r\nschool in 1856, having sixteen scholars on the fore-noon of the first\r\nday and more in the afternoon. He also built a chapel. In a few months\r\nthe school was so full that he could not admit any more children. Then\r\nhe opened evening classes and services on Sunday, which were attended by\r\n150 persons, who seldom went to a place of worship. In answer to earnest\r\nprayer Dr. Laseron received small and large, and even very large, gifts\r\nof money for his work in a most remarkable manner, often from people who\r\nwere entire strangers to him, notably the brothers Samuel and John\r\nMorley supported him very generously, so that he was enabled to\r\nestablish the Evangelical Protestant Deaconesses' Training Institution\r\nat Tottenham, now called The Prince of Wales's General Hospital. Dr.\r\nLaseron reached the age of 75, and before his departure he asked a\r\nfriend to write to his children in Australia--\"I thank God that I am\r\nsurrounded by such as love me and Him.\"\r\n\r\nLASERON, Rev. David, came to Edinburgh from Germany, and maintained\r\nhimself there by giving lessons in German and in Hebrew. He had also\r\nChristian pupils who visited him when he was sick and from whose young\r\nlips he first heard of the great Physician of souls. After his baptism\r\nin 1844 he was sent as a missionary to Cochin, where he established\r\nschools for heathen and Jewish children. In 1852, these schools were\r\nattended by 16 white Jewish boys, 112 black Jewish boys and 24 girls.\r\nLaseron baptized one Jew there by the name of Jehil Benjamin, in 1849.\r\nHe was recalled home in 1855, owing to some disagreement with his\r\ncolleague.\r\n\r\nLASSON, Adolf, born in Alt Strelitz, 1859, embraced Christianity while\r\nhe was tutor of Philosophy in the University of Berlin. He wrote the\r\nfollowing works: \"Fichte über das Verhältniss von Staat und Kirche,\"\r\nBerlin, 1863; \"Meister Eckhardt der Mystiker,\" 1878; \"Das Cultur ideal\r\nund der Krieg,\" 1868; \"Principien der Zukunft des Volkesrechts,\" 1871.\r\nIn reference to religion, he belonged to the evangelical party in the\r\nGerman Church. The year of his baptism is not known.\r\n\r\nLAUB, P. B., born in the Bukowina, Austria, and received a strictly\r\northodox Jewish education. Receiving a New Testament from some one, he\r\nbecame convinced of the truth of Christianity, and then went to London,\r\nwhere he came in contact with the writer, who recommended him to the\r\nOperative Jewish Converts' Institution, but he soon left for Stuttgart,\r\nand was baptized by Gottheil there. He then studied at Basel, but\r\nwishing to devote his life to the Jewish Mission, he went to the\r\nInstitutum Delitzschianum, in Leipzig, to prepare himself for future\r\nwork. In 1889, he went to assist Mr. Flad in Tunis, and then was called\r\nby the French, and afterwards by the Swiss Missionary Society to be\r\ntheir missionary in Alsace.\r\n\r\nLAURIA, Rabbi Elieser, was one of several Rabbis who became Christians\r\nin Jerusalem in the first half of the nineteenth century. He was\r\nbaptized by Bishop Alexander in 1843, whereupon he was forced by the\r\nJewish authorities to divorce his wife, who was sent by them back to\r\nRussia. She, however, returned to him in 1846, and in the next year she\r\ntoo made a public confession of her faith in our Saviour. Henceforth she\r\nassisted her husband in winning souls, and they laboured together at\r\nCairo, until her death of cholera in 1849. Lauria opened a mission\r\nschool there in 1850. He was much esteemed, even by the rabbis, and he\r\ncirculated the Scriptures as far as Arabia, and the mission was not\r\nwithout results.\r\n\r\nLAZARUS, Joshua George, was baptized with his wife and two children in\r\nLiverpool, under the ministry of Rev. H. S. Joseph. In 1842, he became\r\nhis assistant there and in Manchester. In 1851, Lazarus reported that\r\nsixty-eight Jews had been baptized since he entered upon his labours in\r\nthe two cities. He retired on account of feeble health in 1853, and died\r\nin 1869.\r\n\r\nLEBERT, Herman, M.D. (Levy), born 1813, died 1878. He as a Christian\r\ndoctor was very distinguished. Friedrich Wilhelm IV. bestowed upon him\r\nthe gold medal for Art and Science. He became Professor of Medicine in\r\nBreslau, 1859. His literary works are: \"Anatomie Pathologique générale\r\net speciale,\" 2 vols., 1854-62, for which the Parisian Academy gave him\r\nthe prize. \"Handbuch der Practischen Medicin,\" 2 vols., 1859.\r\n\r\nLEBRECHT, Abraham (Herz), born at Gross-Glogau Germany, 1706. At the age\r\nof seventeen both his parents died, and his relatives sent him to a\r\nJewish high school at Prague. In 1739, he was a teacher at Belgrade, and\r\nwhen the Turks captured the city, they sold him and Newman, son of a\r\nLutheran pastor, with many others, as slaves. The master tempted Newman\r\nto sin, but he resisted, and was cruelly beaten. The master then tried\r\nto make him yield through the medium of Herz, but Newman said to him: \"I\r\ncannot offend my Lord Jesus, and would rather die than commit sin.\" This\r\nmade a strong impression upon the young Jew, and henceforth he became\r\nvery anxious about the state of his soul, and the other preached to him\r\nthe good tidings of salvation through Christ. Newman died from the\r\nstripes he had received, and Herz was sold to Hadshi Mustapha, who\r\nbrought him to Smyrna in 1741. There the Jewish community bought his\r\nrelease, presented him with sixteen ducats, and sent him to\r\nConstantinople, whence he made his way back to Germany, where in various\r\nways he experienced the lovingkindness of God. Twice when he was in\r\ngreat despair, and was about to commit suicide, he was providentially\r\nsaved and brought to his senses by Christians, who had come to him at\r\nthe right moment. In his wanderings he visited Friedrich Augusti, the\r\nwell-known convert, who had had similar trials. Finally, he was baptized\r\non Whitsunday, 1744, when he assumed the name of Lebrecht (Live right),\r\nand refused to receive a present from his sponsors, which it was the\r\ncustom to give. He then lived as a consistent Christian to the age of\r\n70, and died in 1776. This extract is taken by Pastor de le Roi from\r\nLebrecht's autobiography, which closes with a prayer for the conversion\r\nof Israel.\r\n\r\nLEDERER, Gideon R., born in 1804. As the son of a rabbi he was educated\r\nin strict rabbinical orthodoxy, and for a time was a rabbi himself. He\r\nand his wife were converted under the ministry of the early Scotch\r\nmissionaries, and afterwards assisted them to spread the Gospel in\r\nHungary. In 1853, he came to London, but soon after went to New York,\r\nwhere he laboured for the rest of his days, as a humble city missionary,\r\nwith much blessing. He edited a periodical entitled, \"The Israelite\r\nIndeed,\" and the writer knew him as such an one himself.\r\n\r\nLEENER, de Louis, a Dutch convert of the nineteenth century, was a\r\nrespected author. Among his works are these--(1) \"Ben Onie, Tafereelen\r\nuit het dagboek van een tot het Christendom bekeerden Israelit,\" (2) \"De\r\nwaarde vrouw in Israel,\" (3) \"De Nederlandsche jood,\" (4) \"Ons Pascha,\"\r\nAmsterdam, 1865-70.\r\n\r\nLEHRS, Karl, was born in Königsberg in 1802, and died 1878. It is\r\nrecorded that while studying in Berlin he became a Christian from\r\nconviction, and was baptized in 1822. A number of his relatives were\r\ninfluenced by him for Christianity. He was a classical teacher in\r\nseveral schools, and then Professor at the University of Königsberg. He\r\npublished a book of considerable merit under the title, \"De Aristarchi\r\nStudiis Homericis,\" 1833; \"Questiones Epicae,\" 1837; \"Pindars-scholien,\"\r\n1873.\r\n\r\nLEIBNISTH, Samuel, born 1823, was a Jewish teacher, and after his\r\nconversion, about 1868, devoted his leisure to voluntary missionary work\r\namong the Jews in Germany. In 1874, he was appointed missionary at\r\nElberfeld, where he died in 1882.\r\n\r\nLEITNER, H. C., was won for the Master by the Rev. C. A. Schönberger. He\r\nlaboured at Constantinople as a very able teacher in the Scotch mission\r\nschools for many years.\r\n\r\nLEITNER, Dr. M., born at Pesth in 1800, studied medicine and settled as\r\na practitioner at Broussa in Turkey. Having come into possession of a\r\nNew Testament, he read it carefully, and was converted and baptized in\r\n1844. He then gave up his lucrative position and devoted his life to\r\nmissionary work. He was the L.J.S. medical missionary at Constantinople\r\nfrom 1853 to 1861, when he died of fever.\r\n\r\nLEO, Dr., a physician in Warsaw, after having had intercourse with the\r\nL.J.S. missionaries for eight years, became fully convinced of the truth\r\nof the Gospel, and was baptized with his family in 1831.\r\n\r\nLEONHARD, Friedrich Conrad, a convert in the latter half of the\r\neighteenth century, published a dialogue under the title, \"Erweis dass\r\ndie Rabbinen Schnurstracks wider dass Gesetz Moses lehren, Aus den\r\nKirchengesetzbüchern der heutigen Juden geführt,\" with a preface by\r\nPastor Siegmund Mörl, Nürnberg, 1781.\r\n\r\nLESSMAN, Daniel, was born in Soldin (Brandenburg), 1794, studied\r\nmedicine in Berlin, was wounded in the war, baptized in 1824, he became\r\na great author, novelist, biographer and poet.\r\n\r\nLEVI, Jacob, a native of Smyrna, according to the report of Dr.\r\nBuchanan, heard the Gospel from a C.M.S. missionary. He then bought a\r\nNew Testament and studied it with the intention of refuting the\r\narguments of the missionary, and for this purpose he translated it into\r\nHebrew, but the result was that he became a believer and preached Christ\r\nto Jews, Mohammedans and Christians.\r\n\r\nLEVI, Jacob, baptized by the missionaries Lewis and Hartley at Athens,\r\nabout 1840-1. Was cast into prison by the Rabbis ten times. In the\r\nprison at Casanegra, he was bastinadoed and kept six months, but he\r\ndeclared if he was there a thousand years he would still confess that\r\nJesus was the true Messiah.\r\n\r\nLEVI, Dr. Leone, was born in Ancona, 1802, and settled in England. An\r\narticle of his in the \"Liverpool Album,\" in 1849, occasioned the\r\nestablishment of the Chamber of Commerce, of which he became secretary.\r\nHe joined the Presbyterian Church, was author of \"Commercial Laws, their\r\nPrinciples and Administration,\" 1850-52; \"Wages and Earnings of the\r\nWorking Classes,\" 1867; \"History of British Commerce and of the Economic\r\nProgress of the British Nation,\" 1863-70. He became professor of\r\npolitical economy at King's College in 1862; barrister in Lincoln's Inn,\r\n1859; D.L. of Tübingen, 1861: and died in 1888.\r\n\r\nLEVIEN, Edward, was born in 1818, of highly respectable Jewish parents,\r\nnearly related to the distinguished Goldsmids. His parents returned to\r\nthe true faith, and were baptized and admitted into the Church of\r\nEngland, with their children, when the latter were yet of tender age. He\r\nwas educated at Shrewsbury Grammar School, under Drs. Butler and\r\nKennedy, and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he took honours in\r\nclassics. In that department he filled a professor's chair at Glasgow.\r\nHis great skill in ancient manuscripts, and intimate acquaintance with\r\nhistorical lore commended him, in 1850, to an important post in the MSS.\r\ndepartment of the British Museum. This post he held for nearly a quarter\r\nof a century, with advantage to the public and credit to himself. He was\r\nalso honorary secretary of the British Archæological Association, to\r\nwhich he rendered essential service in promoting its prosperity, in\r\nvarious ways, literary and otherwise. His loss to that Association was\r\nas keenly felt by their Committee as by his most intimate friends. The\r\ncatalogue of the British Museum has several pages devoted to his\r\nliterary productions.\r\n\r\nLEVINSOHN, Hessel, a brother of the next named, who together with his\r\nparents had anathematized Isaac on account of his supposed apostasy, was\r\nin the first place influenced by him through correspondence, not to pass\r\nsuch a harsh judgment upon himself. Then, when he came to England, he\r\nwas gradually won by him and other Hebrew Christians to read the New\r\nTestament, and to search the Scriptures earnestly, until he too could\r\npublicly confess that Jesus was his own Redeemer. He afterward became a\r\nmissionary of the British Society for the Propagation of the Gospel\r\namongst the Jews.\r\n\r\nLEVINSON, Rev. Isaac, was born in Kovno (Russia), in 1855. His father\r\nwas a pious man, and used to fast every Monday and Thursday. When Isaac\r\nwas five years old, his father himself taught him Hebrew, and then sent\r\nhim to school, where he made rapid progress in learning, so that at the\r\nage of eight he could read the Pentateuch with the Targum and Rashi's\r\ncommentary. Henceforth he studied mostly the Talmud, in which he felt no\r\ndelight nor even satisfaction, especially when at thirteen years of age\r\nhe became bar mitsvah (confirmed), and began to realize responsibility\r\nfor his sins. This caused him to lay aside the doctrines of men, and to\r\nstudy more diligently the Word of God. In 1871 he took leave of his\r\nparents, and after much hardship and God's loving care on the journey,\r\narrived in London, September 19th, with the intention to go from there\r\nto America or Australia. But just as he landed he was robbed of the\r\nlittle baggage he possessed, and a kind Jew took him to his house, with\r\nwhom he spent the Day of Atonement. Subsequently he once passed by the\r\nL.J.S. Chapel at Palestine Place, and noticed a Hebrew inscription on\r\nthe front. Thinking it was a synagogue he entered, and was surprised to\r\nfind that it was a Christian place of worship, where the prayers were\r\nsaid in Hebrew. He listened to the service, and after it was over, a\r\nHebrew Christian spoke to him, and told him that he had found peace in\r\nbelieving in Jesus as the Messiah. This was exactly what Isaac was\r\nsearching for. He then made the acquaintance of Dr. Stern, was\r\ninstructed and baptized by him, and entered the Operative Jewish\r\nConverts' Institution. After a time Levinson was for some years a clerk\r\nin the R.T.S., where he made good use of his time in preparing himself\r\nfor studying in Spurgeon's College. He was then ordained to the Baptist\r\nministry, and was engaged by the British Society as deputational\r\nsecretary, in which capacity he laboured zealously and ably for some\r\nyears, until he was called to succeed the late Rev. John Dunlop, as\r\nchief secretary of the same Society.\r\n\r\nLEVY, Benjamin, was the son of Moses Levy, one of a well-known firm of\r\nshipowners in London. When he was quite a young man he set up in\r\nbusiness as a clothier and draper in Holborn. Subsequently he removed to\r\nSunderland, where he spent the last forty-two years of his life; and so\r\ngreatly did he prosper that he opened branches of his business in\r\nShields, Stockton, Middlesborough, West Hartlepool and Barrow in\r\nFurness. His admission by baptism into the Church of Christ took place\r\nwhen he was twenty-six years old. Before then he had drifted away from\r\nthe moorings of the synagogue, and then soon followed his total neglect\r\nof all religious observance, and all belief in the Bible. It was at this\r\ncrisis in his religious life that he was brought under decidedly\r\nChristian influences. He came in contact with a clergyman of the Church\r\nof England, who led him to accept Christ and Him crucified; after which\r\nhe ever remained a faithful follower of the Lord Jesus, and a promoter\r\nof Christian work. He became Warden of St. Thomas', Sunderland, for\r\nwhich Church he did a great deal. He was elected member of the Town\r\nCouncil of Bishopwearmouth in 1861, and in 1871 he was made Alderman of\r\nthe Sunderland Ward; had he lived longer, he would have attained the\r\nchief civil dignity there. His funeral was attended by the whole Town\r\nCouncil in its official capacity. He left a family of four sons and five\r\ndaughters, all of whom were doing well at that time.\r\n\r\nLEVY, Philip, was converted in England, at the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century. He published an English, Hebrew, and Chaldee Grammar\r\nin 1705, at Oxford.\r\n\r\nLEWALD, Fanny, daughter of a Jewish banker at Königsberg, and born 1811,\r\nbecame a member of the Evangelical Church by baptism in 1828. She is\r\ndistinguished as a great authoress. Her works comprise twelve vols., six\r\nof them under the title, \"Meine Lebens Geschichte\" (Autobiography),\r\nBerlin, 1871-75. She died at the age of 78, in 1889.\r\n\r\nLEWIS, Dr. de Leno, was editor of \"Israel's Watchman,\" at Baltimore,\r\n1888.\r\n\r\nLICHTENSTEIN, George Philipp (Susskind Mayer), was born at Frankfort in\r\n1606, and became a Christian through intercourse with pious Christians,\r\nand through hearing Christian hymns.\r\n\r\nLICHTENSTEIN, Jacob, the brother of the above, born in 1826, became a\r\nmore famous pastor and theologian. He published \"Das Leben unsers\r\nHerrn,\" Erlangen, 1855; \"Prüfet alles und das Gute behaltet,\" 1870. He\r\ndied in 1875.\r\n\r\nLICHTENSTEIN, Jehiel Zebi (Hershensohn), was born at Jassy, in 1831, and\r\nbrought up in Bessarabia, among the Chassidim and Kabbalists. Having\r\nreceived a New Testament at Jassy, he studied it diligently, and being\r\nconvinced that Jesus was the Messiah, he baptized himself in a river in\r\n1855. In 1868, he published a Kabbalistic book, entitled, \"Limude\r\nhanebiim,\" in which he tried to show that the teaching of the Kabbalah\r\nand of the New Testament are identical. In 1872, he came to London and\r\nwas baptized by Dr. Stern. He then assisted for a short time Mr.\r\nDworkowicz in Warsaw and Pastor Weber in Neudeklslau. From 1874 to 1879\r\nhe laboured as a missionary of the Berlin Society in Berlin. He then was\r\nfor a time in Russia, whence he went to Leipzig in 1885, where he was\r\nafterwards appointed to be one of the tutors at the Institutum\r\nDelitzschianum. He is the author, besides the above-mentioned, of the\r\nfollowing Hebrew works:--\"Chizzuk Emunah Emeth\" (A defence of\r\nChristianity against the Jewish book \"Chizzuk Emunah,\") 1879; \"Toldoth\r\nJeshua,\" a refutation of the book under that name, 1883; \"A Short\r\nRabbinic Commentary on the whole of the New Testament,\" published\r\ngradually. Lichtenstein also translated the whole of the Old Testament\r\ninto Yiddish for the British and Foreign Bible Society, of which parts\r\nhave appeared.\r\n\r\nLICHTENSTEIN, Johann Daniel, son of the above, who was baptized in his\r\nyouth, became afterwards a very devoted Pastor in Frankfort. It is\r\nrecorded that he displayed self-sacrificing activity, especially among\r\nthe sick and the prisoners. He died in 1862, and in allusion to his name\r\n\"Lightstone,\" the people said of him that \"he was a light which consumed\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\nLICHTENSTEIN, Moritz, born 1824, embraced Christianity in 1842 together\r\nwith his mother and brothers and sisters. Moritz became a preacher of\r\nthe Gospel in 1855, and died 1876.\r\n\r\nLICHTENSTEIN, Rabbi J., is one of the most remarkable converts to\r\nChristianity in the nineteenth century. The story is briefly this:\r\nFinding one day a New Testament in the school under his charge, he took\r\nit away, and hid it in his library. Then during an anti-Semitic\r\nagitation in Hungary he, thinking that there must be something in the\r\nteaching of the New Testament, which excited enmity against the Jews,\r\nexamined it carefully, and was convinced of the contrary, and more, he\r\nbegan to admire and to love the Lord Jesus, and gradually to quote\r\npassages from the New Testament in his sermons in the synagogue of Tapio\r\nSzele, of which he had been minister for forty years. He also wrote\r\nthree pamphlets--\"Der Talmud auf der Anklage Bank,\" Budapesth, 1866;\r\n\"Mein Zeugniss,\" 1886; \"Die Liebe und die Bekehrung, ein sehr ernstes\r\nwort zu sehr ernster Zeit.\" At last some of his congregation accused him\r\nto the chief rabbi of Budapest of heterodoxy. Rabbi Lichtenstein then\r\nconfessed his faith in Jesus Christ crucified. The result was that he\r\nhad to resign his office, and to the end of his life he lived as a\r\nChristian, constantly preaching the Gospel in Pesth though not\r\nbaptized. He died in the Lord in 1908.\r\n\r\nLIPSCHITZ, Benjamin, a convert to Christianity, died 1876, in Vienna,\r\nleaving to the inhabitants of his birthplace, Kriegshaber, near\r\nAugsburg, 70,000 gulden, to be equally divided between Jews and\r\nChristians. Besides this he bequeathed 35,000 gulden to the Jewish\r\nCongregation of Augsburg, 100,000 gulden for the Jewish Home at Munich,\r\nand 100,000 gulden for the Jewish Home at Vienna.\r\n\r\nLIPSHYTZ, Christlieb T., Director of the Barbican Mission to the Jews,\r\nLondon. Born in 1858 at Warsaw, the capital of Poland, he was brought up\r\nin strict Judaism, according to the principles of his orthodox Jewish\r\nparents. It was essential that he should undergo a Talmudical Jewish\r\ntraining, and in addition he was given a thorough secular education.\r\nWhen he was five years of age, his eldest sister became a Christian, and\r\nfor this she endured severe persecution. Her testimony made a deep\r\nimpression on the mind of her brother, and awakened a desire in his\r\nheart to know what it was that Christianity really taught. So strong was\r\nthis desire that while at the secular high school in his native city, he\r\nembraced every possible opportunity of listening to the religious\r\ninstruction given to the Gentile pupils. For this he was chastised by\r\nhis father, but the severe punishment inflicted was of no avail, for the\r\nSpirit of God had directed the message of the Gospel home to his heart,\r\nand within a short time he surrendered to the Lord. The bitter\r\npersecution through which his sister had passed was a vivid and painful\r\nmemory, and it is not surprising that Lipshytz hesitated to incur the\r\nsame suffering by making a public confession in his native place.\r\nEventually he went away to Königsberg. Here, after a course of\r\ninstruction by a missionary of the London Jews' Society (Mr. Skolkowski)\r\nand the Rev. Konsistorialrath Dr. Kahle, he was baptized on the 19th\r\nOctober, 1878. After further study and preparation he worked under the\r\nauspices of the home mission in the North of Germany, and afterwards in\r\nconnexion with the mission among Jews in the West of Germany. Coming to\r\nEngland, Mr. Lipshytz was for some time superintendent of the Wanderers'\r\nHome, under the direction of the late Rev. J. M. Eppstein. At the close\r\nof 1887 he became assistant missionary to the Rev. Paul Warschawski.\r\nWhen the latter relinquished the mission on account of failing health,\r\nthe work was in danger of coming to an untimely end. At this crisis\r\nPrebendary Gordon Calthrop, who became the first President, called\r\ntogether a number of friends, with the result that Mr. Lipshytz was\r\nasked to undertake the re-organization of the work. After prayerful\r\nconsideration, the invitation was accepted. For two years and a-half the\r\nmission was housed in London Wall, thence a removal was made to larger\r\npremises in Finsbury Square, which were occupied for seven years. From\r\nthe first, Mr. Lipshytz exercised remarkable tact and ability, and it\r\nbecame increasingly evident that under his able direction the mission\r\nwas destined to become a powerful agency in proclaiming the Gospel to\r\nthe Jews and winning their allegiance to Christ. Prebendary Gordon\r\nCalthrop had now passed to his rest, and Archdeacon Sinclair succeeded\r\nas President, to be followed after a time by Prebendary H. W.\r\nWebb-Peploe, a life-long friend of Israel. With his unfailing energy and\r\nenthusiasm, Mr. Lipshytz set about raising a memorial to the memory of\r\nthe first President of the mission, and in this he had from the first\r\nthe hearty co-operation of the devoted men who formed his council. The\r\noutcome was the erection of the perfectly equipped and commodious\r\nheadquarters of the Barbican Mission situated on the main thoroughfare\r\nof Whitechapel, and known as \"The Gordon Calthrop Memorial,\" which was\r\ndedicated and opened in the spring of 1901. Besides the mission house\r\nand church, the property includes a spacious open-air preaching ground,\r\nwith a stone pulpit. The entire scheme involved an outlay of £13,000,\r\nthe whole of which sum was soon raised. Having succeeded in this matter,\r\nMr. Lipshytz realized the necessity for providing a Home for Converts\r\nand Enquirers, and a permanent residence for the head of the mission.\r\nThis he was also able to accomplish, and the Home at Mitcham, which cost\r\n£3,500, was soon freed from debt. With all his undertakings Mr. Lipshytz\r\nwas careful to see that the spiritual work of the mission was not\r\nneglected. \"First things\" were given first place: hence the mission\r\nabundantly prospered in his hands.\r\n\r\nLÖBEL, Carl Friedrich Raphael, a native of Lissa, in Prussian Poland,\r\nwas baptized by Pastor Hasselman in Soran, in 1825. He studied\r\nPedagogy, became a very effective schoolmaster, and wrote:--\"Gebete für\r\ndie Schule,\" 1836; \"Erklärungen der Episteln,\" 1859. He founded a Rescue\r\nHome, and died in 1869.\r\n\r\nLOBGOTT, Abraham Meyer (sometimes called Gottlob), a native of Posen,\r\nwas instructed and baptized by Pastor Schultz in Berlin in 1769. He\r\nstudied theology in Halle. He translated Elias Levita's \"Massoreth ha\r\nMassorah,\" which Dr. Semler published in 1773. He also translated the\r\nfirst three chapters of Mendelssohn's Judæo-German Pentateuch into\r\nGerman, Erlangen, 1786. He published in 1775, during the time of his\r\nstudies, \"Sententiae Rabb. de successione ab intestato et testimentaria\r\ncollectae a R. Joseph Karo\" (Schulchan Aruch).\r\n\r\nLOPES, Sir Manasseh Massey, Bart., was born in Jamaica in 1755, and died\r\n1838. He belonged to the Sephardim Jews. Both he and his father Mordecai\r\nRodriguez Lopes embraced Christianity in 1802. In that year Manasseh was\r\nreturned to Parliament as member for New Romney and was created a\r\nbaronet in 1805. At the next election, he was returned as member for\r\nBarnstaple, and lastly, for Westbury, where he held also the office of\r\nRecorder, in addition to being a magistrate for two counties.\r\n\r\nLOTKA, Rev. J., a native of Russian Poland, where he was brought up by\r\nhis parents in strict orthodoxy, but as he arrived at the age of\r\ndiscretion, he somehow managed to study, besides Hebrew and the Talmud,\r\nthe Polish and the German languages. Becoming acquainted with much\r\nChristian literature he had a great desire to read the New Testament,\r\nand this led him to give up the position of a Jewish teacher and to come\r\nto London for the purpose of receiving further Christian instruction by\r\nDr. Ewald, who baptized him on November 22, 1863. About two years later\r\nhe went from the Operative Jewish Converts' Institution to Basel,\r\nstudied theology, and was sent out to labour as a Pastor among the\r\nGermans in Illinois, U.S.A. In 1879 he was appointed Professor of Hebrew\r\nin an Episcopal Seminary near Chicago, where he did also missionary work\r\namong the Jews. In 1872, he joined the L.J.S. and was sent to Lemberg,\r\nwhere he laboured for ten years, and visited many towns in Galicia. In\r\n1881, after he had been on a tour of enquiry with the Rev. Frederick\r\nSmith in the Crimea, he was sent to Persia, where he remained from two\r\nto three years, and laid, so to speak, a solid foundation for the\r\nrevived mission there. He subsequently laboured for a few years at Posen\r\nand Bucharest, and much longer in Birmingham, and then succeeded the\r\nRev. J. C. S. Kroenig at Hull. He was the author of several tracts.\r\n\r\nLÖWE, H. G. F., a Hebrew Christian living in Hamburg. With a view to\r\nmake known, both to Jews, and Christians, the nature of rabbinic\r\nJudaism, he wrote the following works:--1. A translation of the first\r\nchapter of Berachoth (Benedictions), with preface, introduction, and\r\nthree appendices, 1836. 2. A translation of four parts of the Shulchan\r\nAruch Aben Ezra, Hoshen Hamishpat, Orach Hayim and Yoreh Deah,\r\n1836-1840.\r\n\r\nLÖWEN, Moses Gotthold (Pseudon, Hananiah Berliner), was born August 8,\r\n1859, just at the time when his father, dressed in mourning, was sitting\r\non the floor in the synagogue, bewailing the destruction of Jerusalem.\r\nWhen the father returned home, a near relative presented him with his\r\nfirstborn son. His parents educated him after the manner of orthodox\r\nJews, and he studied diligently the Talmud and the \"Shulchan Aruch,\" but\r\nvery little the Old Testament. When the boy was fifteen years of age, he\r\nwas employed by the rabbi of Sombar, in Galicia, as a copyist, and for\r\nthis he received from him instruction in rabbinical writings, in the\r\nBible, and in religious philological literature. This distinguished\r\nsavant, Joshua Hullas by name, was liberal-minded and exercised a\r\nsalutary influence upon the boy. Later on he perceived the untenableness\r\nof the rabbinic views of the world, and gave up the idea of becoming a\r\nrabbi as his parents wished. He then devoted himself to commerce, but\r\nfound no pleasure in it. Then he met the Rev. J. Lotka, missionary of\r\nthe L.J.S. at Lemberg, and for the first time learned to know the New\r\nTestament and other Christian literature; and after an inward struggle,\r\nlasting ten years, in which the late Professor Franz Delitzsch\r\nencouraged him to persevere, he threw himself at the feet of Jesus, and\r\nbecame His faithful disciple. He was admitted into the Church of Christ\r\nby baptism, by the Rev. P. E. Gottheil, in Stuttgart, in 1886. Two\r\nyears later he entered the service of the Berlin Society for Promoting\r\nChristianity among the Jews, under whom for years he laboured with great\r\nblessing upon his efforts. Löwen's work was mostly of a literary\r\ncharacter. In 1888, he wrote a useful booklet in Yiddish, entitled\r\n\"Siach l'Elohim,\" through which he introduced the jargon of the Eastern\r\nJews into Christian literature. A year later he joined Chr. Theophilus\r\nLucky, in editing the Hebrew monthly periodical, \"Eduth l'Israel.\" This\r\nwas and remained the first Jewish Christian periodical in the sacred\r\nlanguage. He worked at this difficult post for only two years, but\r\ncontinued in co-operation with Professor Dalman for fifteen years in the\r\npublication of his monthly Yiddish periodical, \"Berith Am.\" He also\r\ncontributed numerous articles, poems, narratives, etc., to \"Nathanael\"\r\nand to \"Messiasbote,\" publications of the Berlin Society. On Löwen's\r\nsuggestion, the International Jewish Missionary Conference at Leipzig in\r\n1897, resolved to offer a prize for a life of Christ in Yiddish. Amongst\r\nthe competitors was the well-known Joseph Rabinowitz, but the umpires,\r\nProfessor Strack and the Rev. A. Bernstein, adjudged the prize to\r\nLöwen's work, which is entitled \"Podeh Umazil,\" which has found great\r\nacceptance among the Jews. In 1901 a collection of essays appeared from\r\nhis pen, under the title, \"Brod und Salz\" (bread and salt), which was\r\ngladly read. He also brought out a series of booklets entitled \"Orchim,\"\r\nwhich was of the greatest missionary value. Löwen was stationed in\r\nBerlin, Lemberg, Posen, and Vienna, where he continued to testify to\r\nthe Jews of the unsearchable riches of Christ, and the Lord crowned his\r\nwork with success, in that he was permitted to witness a spirit of\r\nenquiry among the Jews, not a few of whom acknowledged Him as their Lord\r\nand Saviour through his labours.\r\n\r\nLÖWENTHAL, Rev. Isidor, a native of Posen, where he received a liberal\r\neducation, finishing his studies at the Gymnasium at the age of\r\nseventeen. His father wished him to enter into business, but he had no\r\ntaste for such a life. With companions of the same age, he founded a\r\nliberal political union, and owing to a poem of a radical character,\r\nwhich he recited in public, he was arrested by the police. For this\r\nreason he emigrated to New York in 1846. On his arrival he tried to get\r\nemployment, but failed. He was then obliged to become a pedlar. One cold\r\nNovember day he offered his goods to the Rev. S. M. Gayley, of\r\nWilmington, Delaware, who, noticing his poor plight, invited him to his\r\nhouse, where in conversation he soon learned that Löwenthal was well\r\neducated. He then offered him hospitality until he should find a\r\nsituation as teacher of German and French. This he procured for him in\r\nFayette College at Easton, Pa., in 1847. There Löwenthal was\r\nindefatigable in his studies of the English language and literature. His\r\niron will and his excellent memory enabled him soon to overcome all\r\ndifficulties. Hitherto he had not revealed to Mr. Gayley his Jewish\r\nnationality, but now he not only did this but also told him that the\r\nfamily prayers and the services which he had attended had led him to\r\nstudy the Scriptures, and that he was convinced of the truth of\r\nChristianity. He was then baptized by Mr. Gayley in the Presbyterian\r\nChurch. In 1848 he became teacher of languages at Mount Holly Collegiate\r\nSchool, where he remained several years. Mr. Philipps, of the First\r\nPresbyterian Church, New York, advised him to study for the ministry,\r\nand he entered the Theological Seminary at Princeton, New Jersey in\r\n1852. During his course there he contributed articles to the \"Biblical\r\nRepository.\" When about to leave the Seminary, he gave a lecture on\r\nIndian missions and then offered his services to the Board of Foreign\r\nMissions. The Board sent him in 1856 to Afghanistan. He acquired the\r\nlanguage in one year, so that he could preach in it fluently; but he was\r\nonly permitted to labour there seven years. During this short time he\r\ntranslated the whole of the New Testament in Pushtu and printed it, and\r\ncompiled a dictionary of that language which he left in manuscript. He\r\npreached easily in five languages, and none knew the East better than he\r\ndid. He possessed the largest collection of Asiatic MSS. and rare books\r\nthat ever was the lot of a European. He was beloved by the natives and\r\nEuropeans alike. Sir John Lawrence, especially during the mutiny,\r\nconsulted him as a friend. He preached uninterruptedly in Afghanistan\r\nand in the Khyber Pass. At the last, he was shot dead by his own\r\nservant, it is said through a mistake, who, seeing him walking on the\r\nroof at night, took him for a thief. This was in 1864, when he was only\r\nthirty-eight.\r\n\r\nLOWITZ, Rev. J., laboured for years as a missionary of the British\r\nSociety at Algiers, where he also acted as agent for the British and\r\nForeign Bible Society. In 1872 he succeeded Davidsohn as principal of\r\nthe British Society's Home for Converts and Enquirers, at 28, Alfred\r\nPlace, Bedford Square, London.\r\n\r\nLUCKY, Rev. C. Theophilus, a native of Tisminitz, in Galicia, and a most\r\nremarkable convert to Christianity in the nineteenth century. He was\r\nknown not only as a great Hebrew scholar, writing Hebrew in classical\r\nstyle as a living language, and as thoroughly conversant with the whole\r\nrange of Jewish literature, but also as possessing a wide knowledge of\r\nChristian literature. Having studied at the Berlin University and High\r\nSchool for the knowledge of Judaism, and making researches in\r\nphilosophical and religious subjects, he was led to become a believer.\r\nLucky received Evangelical ordination in New York. In 1887 he first\r\npublished a Hebrew periodical, \"Eduth le Israel,\" which he continued for\r\nsome years, when he returned to Galicia and took up his residence in\r\nStanislau. There he lived and laboured among his brethren, preaching by\r\nthe written and spoken word, but above all by his example, scarcely\r\nreceiving any help from men. He was a living illustration of a Hebrew\r\nChristian of the first century; though thoroughly Orthodox as to the\r\ncardinal doctrines of Christianity, yet he believed that it was\r\nincumbent upon him to observe the Jewish Sabbath and all other Jewish\r\nfestivals and the dietary laws, not for the sake of being justified by\r\nthe works of the law, but for the sake of satisfying his own conscience,\r\nand that he might be more useful as an evangelist amongst his brethren\r\nin Galicia.\r\n\r\nMAAS, Dr. M., was a teacher at Breslau in the nineteenth century, and\r\nwrote the following works, advocating amalgamation of the Jews with\r\nChristians: \"Die Sociale Stellung der Juden in Deutschland und das\r\nCeremonial Gesetz,\" Löbau, 1876; \"Die Mischehe das Einzig wirksame\r\nmittel einer dauernden Vereinigung zwischen der jüdischen und\r\nchristlichen Bevölkerung Deutschland's,\" ib.\r\n\r\nMACKHAN, Beatus Christian (Nehemiah Cohen), after having travelled in\r\nthree continents, and held the office of Rabbi at Avignon embraced\r\nChristianity, in the Baltic Provinces in 1672. In 1690 he published in\r\nthe German language: \"Schriftmässiger Jesus--Palmbaum oder Klarer\r\nBeweissthum wider die Juden, dass Jesus der wahre Messias sei\" (Riga),\r\nWolf, Bibliotheca Hebraica 3. N., 1648.\r\n\r\nMAGATH, Rev. Julius, some time after his baptism became Professor in the\r\nWesleyan College in Oxford (Georgia, U.S.A.) Later on he was requested\r\nby the Conference to do missionary work among the Jews. In 1886 he\r\npublished a periodical entitled, \"The Hebrew Missionary,\" and this was\r\nchanged in 1888 to \"The Hebrew Messenger.\" He also translated a\r\ntreatise, written by the Roman Catholic Jewish convert M. M. Leman,\r\nentitled, \"Jesus before the Sanhedrin,\" 1887.\r\n\r\nMAIMUNY, Rabbi Mordecai, was born at Bona, Algeria, in 1817. His father\r\nwas a well-to-do goldsmith, who had settled in Tunis in 1823, where\r\nMaimuny received a strict rabbinical education. When Dr. Ewald was\r\nstationed at Tunis, Maimuny was his great opponent and used to blaspheme\r\nthe name of Jesus. Later on he went to Jerusalem, where his fanaticism\r\nbecame more excited when he observed the activity of Bishop Alexander.\r\nHowever, the bishop's calm and gentle disposition made a great\r\nimpression upon him, and he received a Hebrew New Testament, which he\r\nstudied diligently and became a changed man. His wife seeing that he\r\nvisited Nicolayson and the other missionaries was very angry with him.\r\nTo pacify her, and in the hope that she would change her mind, he left\r\nJerusalem with her, and they wandered through Asia, North Africa, and\r\nEurope, and then returned to Jerusalem, where he had to undergo great\r\npersecution, and was obliged to return to his native place. Finally, in\r\n1853, he was baptized by the Scotch missionary, the Rev. Benjamin Weiss.\r\n\r\nMAMLOCK, L. C, a native of Kalisch, was instructed and baptized by Dr.\r\nEwald in 1863. After being in the Operative Jewish Converts' Institution\r\nfor some considerable time, Dr. Ewald employed him as his assistant, and\r\nhe became a parochial lay reader. Subsequently he was appointed by the\r\nL.J.S. as missionary in Manchester, and was transferred to Paris after\r\nthe Franco-German war. There he laboured faithfully the rest of his\r\nlife, spreading the Gospel far and wide during several exhibitions, and\r\nhad the privilege to see many sons and daughters trusting in the Lord\r\nJesus Christ for their salvation.\r\n\r\nMARCUS, Moses, born in London, 1701, was sent by his father to Hamburg\r\nfor his education. There he had intercourse with Christians, read the\r\nNew Testament, and came to a saving knowledge of the truth. In 1721 his\r\nfather returned to England from India, where he had amassed a fortune,\r\nand summoned him to come home. Marcus then told his father of his\r\nreligious convictions, when the latter was shocked, and threatened to\r\ndisinherit him if he should be baptized; he once even threw a long knife\r\nat him. Marcus, however, persevered and was baptized in 1723. In 1724 he\r\nwrote a pamphlet entitled, \"Principal Motives to leave the Jewish\r\nFaith.\" In defence of Christianity, against the then prevalent\r\nrationalism, he translated into English the second part of Dr. J.\r\nGottlob Carpzov's \"Critica Sacra,\" adding his own notes (London, 1729).\r\n\r\nMARCUSOHN, Rev. J. W., was sent by the Scotch Church as a missionary to\r\nConstantinople, at the request of the American Board of Missions, in\r\n1859. He subsequently preached the Gospel to the Jews in the United\r\nStates of America.\r\n\r\nMARGOLIOUTH, Ezekiel, was a very remarkable man, a typical Jew, and a\r\ntypical convert to Christianity. As an Hebraist he was equal to any of\r\nhis day. He had a profound knowledge of the Talmud, rare even amongst\r\nTalmudists. It was, however, in the composition of modern Hebrew that\r\nhis chief talent lay, and competent scholars often spoke\r\nenthusiastically of the elegance of his rabbinic writings. Like his\r\nnamesake, Dr. Moses Margoliouth, he was a native of Suwalki in Poland,\r\nwhere he was born in November 1816. His father, Abraham, had been\r\nthirty-three years chief rabbi of the town, and his mother could trace\r\ntwelve rabbis amongst her ancestors. It was natural that Ezekiel should\r\nstudy the Talmud and practise all the precepts of the rabbis with the\r\nutmost vigour. After he had become bar mitzvah, he studied with his\r\nfather, and later on went to Brody, in order to perfect himself in\r\nrabbinic lore. There he met enlightened Jews, and often disputed with R.\r\nSolomon Kluger. He began to study the Bible, and philosophical works in\r\nHebrew, like those of Maimonides; his desire for knowledge being\r\nfostered under Michael Perl of Tarnopol, the first Jewish reformer in\r\nGalicia. Later on he went to the rabbinical seminary at Warsaw, where he\r\nfirst met missionaries of the L.J. Society, through whom he was\r\nirresistibly drawn to Christ, His Person, and His teachings. At the age\r\nof twenty-seven he confessed faith in Christ as his Saviour, though his\r\nwife, whom he had married the previous year, for a long time refused to\r\nbecome a Christian. He then came over to England, where she afterwards\r\njoined him, and in 1848, also became a Christian. In the same year he\r\nentered the Operative Jewish Converts' Institution to learn bookbinding.\r\nIn 1852 he was appointed a missionary of the L.J.S. in London, and\r\nworked as such almost to the end of his life. It was not as a popular\r\npreacher that he excelled, though his faith in, and knowledge of, the\r\nWord of God always profoundly attracted his audiences. His chief labours\r\nwere literary, and in these he had no rival. His \"Derech Emunah\" and\r\n\"Nethivoth Olam,\" in Hebrew, are masterpieces. His greatest work was the\r\nrevision of the New Testament in Hebrew in 1865. On May 2, 1894, he\r\npassed away in a gentle and peaceful death, greatly mourned both for\r\nhimself and for the loss of his learning and piety. His son is the Rev.\r\nProfessor David S. Margoliouth, D.Lit., Laudian Professor of Arabic at\r\nOxford University, and examining chaplain to the Bishop of Liverpool.\r\n\r\nMARGOLIOUTH, Rev. George, a nephew of Dr. Moses Margoliouth, was\r\nconverted to Christianity at Strassburg. He studied philology at the\r\nUniversity of Bonn, and theology at Cuddesdon College, was ordained in\r\n1881-1883, held the curacy of St. Thomas', Leeds, when he was also\r\nmissionary of the Parochial Missions to the Jews; then at Carleton,\r\nYorks., 1883-84; then again missionary curate of Holy Trinity, Stepney,\r\n1884-87; then at St. Mary the Less, Cambridge, 1887-89; St. Botolph,\r\nCambridge, 1889-91, when he took his degree in Semitic languages, at\r\nQueen's College. He is the author of \"Descriptive List of the Hebrew and\r\nSamaritan MSS. in the British Museum,\" 1893; \"The Superlinear\r\nPunctuation,\" 1893; \"The Liturgy of the Nile, Palestinian, Syriac and\r\nEnglish,\" 1896; \"The Palestinian Syriac Version of Holy Scripture, four\r\nrecently Discovered Portions,\" 1896. He also contributed valuable\r\narticles to the \"Jewish Quarterly Review.\"\r\n\r\nMARGOLIOUTH, Rev. Dr. Moses, was born at Suwalki in 1820, and died in\r\nLondon, 1881. He was no relation to Ezekiel Margoliouth, though from the\r\nsame town. Coming to Liverpool in 1837 he met the missionaries of the\r\nL.J.S., Lazarus and Rev. H. S. Joseph, and as a result of intercourse\r\nwith them he was baptized in 1838. He entered Trinity College, Dublin,\r\nin 1840, and became curate of St. Augustine, Liverpool, January 30,\r\n1844. Much later he was curate of St. Paul's, Onslow Square, London, and\r\nlastly, Vicar of Little Limford, Buckinghamshire. He took the degree of\r\nPh.D. at Erlangen in 1857. In 1847 he started a Hebrew Christian monthly\r\nmagazine entitled, \"The Star of Jacob.\" In the seventies he was editor\r\nof \"The Hebrew Christian Witness.\" He also wrote the following works,\r\nall published in London: \"Modern Judaism\" (1843), \"The History of the\r\nJews of Great Britain\" (1851), \"A Pilgrimage to the Land of my Fathers\"\r\n(1855), \"The Curates of Riverdale\"(1860), \"The Spirit of Prophecy\"\r\n(1864), \"The Poetry of the Hebrew Pentateuch\" (1871). Margoliouth was\r\none of the revisers of the English version of the Old Testament. He\r\nwrote also a considerable number of minor works.\r\n\r\nMARGOLIOUTH, Naphtali, baptized in 1603 under the name of Konrad Otto,\r\nbecame professor of Hebrew in Altorf. He wrote \"Grammatica Hebraica\"\r\n(Nurnberg, 1605), a part of a \"Dictionarium radicale\" of rabbinic and\r\nTalmudic words, \"Gale Razia or Revelatio arcanorum ex Daniel ii. 29,\" in\r\nLatin and German.\r\n\r\nMARKHEIM, H. A., was one of the most gifted missionaries of the L.J.S.\r\nin the nineteenth century. As a great linguist he suitably occupied the\r\nfollowing stations: In 1840, he succeeded Lewis at Smyrna; in 1850, he\r\nlaboured at Oran and Tangier; in 1860, at Gibraltar; in 1863, at Turin;\r\nfrom 1861-63, at Marseilles, and then until the siege of Paris by the\r\nGermans, he laboured there. He died in 1889.\r\n\r\nMARIA was born of English Jewish parents, in affluent circumstances.\r\nWhen yet a child she fell down a steep flight of stairs and seriously\r\ninjured her spine, so that she became a permanent invalid. A Christian\r\nlady used to visit her, and got permission to read to her the Psalms.\r\nShe asked her father to buy her a Bible, who instead of doing so bought\r\nher some narratives, but seeing her disappointment, complied with her\r\nrequest. From this Bible, which contained the New Testament, she learned\r\nto know and to love the Saviour, believing that Jesus made a perfect\r\natonement for her sins. Becoming gradually feebler and losing her sight,\r\nshe said to Miss P. that she enjoyed great tranquillity of mind, and had\r\nlearned to understand Isaiah xxvi. 3, \"Thou wilt keep him in perfect\r\npeace, whose mind is stayed on Thee.\" Prayer was never a weariness to\r\nher. She influenced her sister to read to her the Bible. She then bore\r\nwitness from her sick bed to the faith which was the source of her calm\r\nresignation and happiness before those friends, both Jews and Gentiles,\r\nwho visited her. When her life drew to a close, she said to her father:\r\n\"Dear father, I have one request to make; remember! it is my dying\r\nrequest, the last favour I shall ever ask you, father.\" With much\r\nkindness he enquired, \"What is it, my dear?\" \"It is, father, that you\r\nwill consent to my baptism.\" \"No, Maria, I cannot do that, you were born\r\na Jewess and you must die one.\" \"Father! that is impossible, for I am a\r\nChristian. I believe that Jesus is the Saviour and without Him we should\r\nperish everlastingly.\" She then explained that by being a Christian she\r\nhad not ceased to be a Jewess. She was then permitted to receive both\r\nsacraments from the curate of the parish. Before her death she said to\r\nher brother: \"My dear brother, be good, and never, never despise the\r\nMessiah Jesus Christ. I am going to heaven, and may I not hope to meet\r\nyou there? I have prayed for you and all my family, and it is my belief\r\nthe Lord will answer my prayers, and shew His salvation to you all.\"\r\n(_Jewish Intelligence_, October, 1841).\r\n\r\nMARKS, J. D., a convert was at first in 1819. It was owing to his\r\ninfluence that a missionary society in Switzerland was founded. This is\r\nemphasized in a letter from Basel to the L.J.S. in 1820, whose\r\nmissionary he then was. At that time there seems to have been an\r\nimportant movement among the Jews of Frankfort and its neighbourhood\r\ntowards Christianity, in which he was to some extent instrumental, and\r\nthe result was that in three years ninety Jews embraced Christianity. He\r\ndied as missionary at Offenbach in 1841.\r\n\r\nMARKS, Rev. John Ebenezer, D.D., of Canterbury, 1879, laboured as a\r\nmissionary at Moulmein, India, 1863-67; as Chaplain at Rangoon,\r\n1867-68; Irrawaddy, 1869 and 1876-83; Mandalay, 1869-76; Tavoy and\r\nMergui, 1883; as missionary of the S.P.G. and Principal of St. John's\r\nCollege, Rangoon, from 1876-96.\r\n\r\nMARX, Adolf Bernard, was born in Halle in 1779. From his youth he was\r\nvery fond of music, and Handel's \"Messiah\" led him to become a\r\nChristian. His father, though indifferent to religion, was very angry\r\nwith him, and he was obliged to prosecute his studies of law and music\r\nunder great deprivations. He finally became a judge at Wittemberg, but\r\nhe had more taste for music than for the law. He then relinquished his\r\noffice and went to Berlin, and devoted himself entirely to the study of\r\nmusic. He made there the acquaintance of the English musician Logier,\r\nand got from him some new ideas, which he was not slow to put into\r\npractice. In 1837, he published a work on the principles of harmony. He\r\ndid much for the proper understanding of Beethoven, Sebastian Bach, and\r\nGlück. He is said to have been the founder of modern musical literature.\r\nHe died in 1866.\r\n\r\nMARX, Karl, born at Treves, in 1818. He was baptized with his father,\r\nhis brother, and five sisters in 1824. In 1842, he became editor of\r\n\"Reinische Zeitung für Politik, Handel, und Gewerbe.\" In 1843, he\r\npublished at Paris, \"Zür Kritik der Hegelschen Rechts Philosophie.\" In\r\n1848 he edited the \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung.\" He is known as the founder\r\nof the political theory called Socialism, and on account of that he came\r\nin conflict with several governments, and he sought refuge in England.\r\nHe married the sister of the minister, von Westphal. She died in 1881,\r\nand he also passed away in 1883, in London.\r\n\r\nMASSENA. All that is known about him is a tract, published at\r\nStrassburg, in 1859, entitled \"Massena ein Wahrer Israelite oder die\r\nKraft Gottes.\"\r\n\r\nMASSIAH, Rev. J. P., was curate of Holy Trinity, Stepney, in 1883, when\r\nhe received some Jews into the Church.\r\n\r\nMATHAI (Shimon), Adam Rudolf George Christoph, was born at Fürth,\r\nGermany in 1715, and was instructed in the Talmud by his father Jaidel,\r\na teacher in the Beth-hamedrash there. At the age of sixteen, he went to\r\nPrague to continue his studies, and on returning home he, too, became a\r\nTalmudic teacher. Just then he narrates, in the preface of his\r\n\"Description of the Jewish Sabbath\": \"When I considered the corruption\r\namong my people, doubts arose in my mind about the rabbinic system of\r\nreligion, and I began to study its doctrines, rites and ceremonies, and\r\nfound that they did not agree with the Word of God.\" The name Jeshua sar\r\nhappanim, in the service for the New Year, struck him as very\r\nmysterious, and he began to enquire as to which of the angels this name\r\nreferred. At last, after long enquiry, he became convinced of the divine\r\norigin of Christianity and applied to a pastor in Fürth for baptism in\r\n1748. However, on account of the commotion created among the Jews, he\r\nwent to Nürnberg, where he was baptized the same year.\r\n\r\nMATTHEWS, Rev. Aaron, after embracing Christianity with his wife, was\r\nappointed a missionary of the British Society in London in 1867, where\r\nhe laboured successfully for some years. Then he accepted a call to be\r\nminister of a Baptist Chapel in Liverpool, which position he only held\r\nfor a few years. Then he opened a mission to the Jews at\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, and afterwards laboured amongst them in Glasgow with\r\nconsiderable blessing on his labours, attracting the Jews by his fervent\r\nand devotional spirit as well as his Hebrew learning.\r\n\r\nMAYER, Samuel Morum, was born in 1797 at Friedenthal; and died in 1862.\r\nHis father was a rabbi, his grandfather was appointed by King Friedrich\r\ngrand rabbi, who gave the grandson a good Jewish education, so that at\r\nthe age of ten he could repeat the Psalter in Hebrew with Mendelssohn's\r\ntranslation. A pastor also privately taught him classics. He was then\r\nsent to a Talmud School, but the Talmud did not satisfy his thirst for\r\nuseful, solid knowledge, so he sent a petition to the King asking for\r\npermission to enter the Gymnasium. This was granted in 1815. He studied\r\nthere and subsequently became a celebrated lawyer. Government offices\r\nwere offered him on condition of his embracing Christianity, which he\r\nrepeatedly refused, but held a professorship unconditionally. However,\r\nhe investigated the doctrines of Christianity himself, and was baptized\r\nin 1834. He was then persecuted by his relations, but he rendered them\r\ngood for evil. The following is a list of his works in their\r\nchronological order; with one exception they were published at Nürnberg.\r\n\"Beschreibung des Jüdischen Sabbath,\"\r\n\r\n1750; \"Die Verderbniss des heutigen Judenthums,\" 1752; \"Beschreibung des\r\nJüdischen Neujahrfestes,\" 1755; \"Beschreibung des Jüdischen\r\nPurimfestes,\" 1758; \"Beschreibung des Jüdischen Yom Kippur,\" 1760;\r\n\"Sammlung Talmudisches Lehrsätze,\" Schwabach, 1763; \"Abhandlung von der\r\nVerleumdung,\" 1765; \"Sendschreiben an Rabbi Peloni aus der Stadt\r\nLo-Theda,\" 1766; \"Kurzgefaste Talmudische Lehrsätze von der\r\nNothwendigkeit sich in den Ehestand zu begeben,\" no date; \"Beweis von\r\nder Uebereinstimmung der alten Israelitischen Kabbalah mit der Lehre des\r\nApostel Paulus,\" no date; \"Beweisgrunde von der Uebereinstimmung der\r\nAltjüdischen Lehre mit der Lehre der Christen,\" 1770; \"Kristliche\r\ngesinnte Erklärung der Kabbalisten über das Hohelied,\" 1776.\r\n\r\nMAYER, Rev. W., was educated both in the school and college of the\r\nL.J.S. in London. In 1855, he succeeded his brother-in-law, the Rev. A.\r\nI. Behrens, at Jassy, where he was assistant missionary for some time\r\npreviously. He had there a most flourishing school, containing about 300\r\nscholars. Mayer, who was a very intellectual man, was somewhat affected\r\nby the criticism on the Bible by Bishop Colenso, and he also was of the\r\nopinion that the Jews ought to have their own Christian Church. This led\r\nto his severance from the Society. He, however, remained in Jassy all\r\nhis life, and revised the Roumanian Bible for the British and Foreign\r\nBible Society.\r\n\r\nMENDELSSOHN, Abraham, second son of Moses Mendelssohn the philosopher,\r\nwas born in Berlin in 1779. In 1804, he married Leah, a sister of Jacob\r\nLevi Solomon Bartholdi. The latter having become a Protestant Christian\r\nin 1805, influenced his sister and brother-in-law to follow his example.\r\nWhilst his father had resisted the arguments and persuasion of Lavater\r\nto take this step, he declared:--\"Formerly I was the son of my father,\r\nnow I am the father of my son.\" Accordingly, he had his children--Felix,\r\nFanny, Rebecca, and Paul--baptized in the Evangelical Church, under the\r\nadditional name of Bartholdi.\r\n\r\nMENDELSSOHN, Dorothea, a daughter of the philosopher Felix, became a\r\nProtestant in Paris in 1802.\r\n\r\nMENDELSSOHN, Felix Bartholdi, was born at Hamburg, February 3, 1809, and\r\ndied 1857. When he was four years old his parents removed to Berlin. His\r\nfather at once procured teachers in music for him, as he had begun thus\r\nearly to show great talent in that direction. His teachers on the piano\r\nwere Louis Bezer, and Zelter, the friend of Goethe. The chapel\r\nchoirmaster, Mr. Hennings, gave him instruction on the violin. The\r\nfather of the poet, Paul Heyse, who later became the celebrated\r\nphilologist, was his private tutor in the home of the Mendelssohns,\r\nwhere the intellectual aristocracy of Berlin frequently assembled. When\r\nFelix was nine years old he appeared for the first time at a public\r\nconcert, where his remarkable performances won him great applause. Two\r\nyears later, we find him in a Berlin Musical Academy, where he studied\r\nchurch music under Zelter's direction. When he was twelve years old,\r\nZelter placed him in the Olympic in Weimar, where he made remarkable\r\nprogress. When he was fourteen, we find him a guest at Goethe's house,\r\nand his host wrote thus to Zelter:--\"Felix's productions astonish\r\neverybody.\" No one was more delighted at the boy's success than his\r\nfather, who took pride in gratifying his son's every wish regarding his\r\nmusical education, and the latter's diligence amply rewarded any outlay.\r\nBefore Felix was out of his teens he had written four operas. His father\r\naccompanied him to Paris, where he had the education of the best\r\nteachers of the time. Soon after he went to London, where he wrote an\r\noriginal overture founded upon Shakespere's \"Midsummer Night's Dream,\"\r\nwhich attracted the attention of the celebrated singer, Henrietta\r\nSonntag, and won a great triumph for its composer--he was then twenty\r\nyears old. He became a member of a Philharmonic Society. He spent some\r\ntime in Rome, where he composed \"Die Walpinges nacht,\" and arranged the\r\none hundred and fifteenth psalm to music. He also visited Naples. This\r\nItalian town made a lasting impression upon his mind. He played before\r\nmany of the crowned heads of Europe. King Frederick William IV. of\r\nPrussia was greatly interested in the young composer, and employed him\r\nto write the music for the \"Tragedy of Sophocles.\" His success greatly\r\nexcited the jealousy of the older musicians, but the King became his\r\ndearest friend. Mendelssohn played in 1841 before Queen Victoria. He\r\nthus described the occasion in a letter to his \"dear little mother.\" \"I\r\nasked Prince Albert, the Queen's husband, to play something on the organ\r\nfor me. He complied. His playing--so beautiful and perfect--many an\r\norganist might have envied him. Then I played and sang my chorus from\r\n\"St. Paul,\" \"How beautiful are the messengers.\" When I had finished the\r\nfirst stanza, the Queen and Prince Albert joined in the singing. The\r\nQueen asked if I had any new compositions; if so, she would gladly have\r\nthem printed. We went into her salon, where there was a piano. I played\r\nand sang again. She praised my playing and singing, and when I bade them\r\nadieu said: 'I hope you will soon visit us in England again.'\" This\r\nbrilliant career was speedily cut short. The death of his dearly beloved\r\nsister Fanny, in the spring of 1847, affected him seriously. All his\r\ncompositions thereafter were melancholy. He became nervous and\r\nirritable. He could not apply himself to his work, but would sit for\r\nhours with his hands folded. After a brief illness he died on November\r\n4, 1857, when he was only thirty-six. Three days after, he was carried\r\nto his grave by the side of his sister Fanny Hensel, in Trinity\r\nCemetery, Berlin. Felix Mendelssohn was a favourite of the German\r\npeople--a musical genius like Weber and Schubert. He put his whole life\r\nand soul into his work. His early death confirms Neander's words--also a\r\nHebrew Christian--\"Whom the gods love die young.\" God gave him a musical\r\ngift, which he delighted to use for His glory.\r\n\r\nMENDELSSOHN, Henrietta, daughter of the banker, Alexander Mendelssohn,\r\nwas baptized in Berlin in 1822.\r\n\r\nMENDELSSOHN, Nathan, the third son of Moses Mendelssohn, was born in\r\n1782. In 1809, he was baptized by the Reformed Pastor Petiscus,\r\nassuming the name of Carl Theodor Nathanael Mendelssohn. He became a\r\nmechanic by profession, and was at the head of a large industry in\r\nSilesia. He was a sincere Christian, and took an interest in missionary\r\nwork among the Jews. He requested the missionaries of the L.J.S. in 1826\r\nto supply him with Bibles for distribution among his workmen. He died in\r\nBerlin in 1852.\r\n\r\nMENSOR, Rev. Dr. Meyer, studied theology in Berlin, where he received\r\nthe degree of D.D. in 1846. He was subsequently chief rabbi of Chicago.\r\nAfter embracing Christianity, he was ordained by the Archbishop of York\r\nin 1861-2. After holding several curacies in the North of England, he\r\nwas appointed Vicar of Stoke Mandeville in 1879, where he preached the\r\nGospel for many years, and took a great interest in missions to the\r\nJews.\r\n\r\nMEYER, Friedrich Christian, born in Hamburg in the second half of the\r\nseventeenth century, died in Belgium about 1738. After having been\r\nbaptized at Bremen, he became a missionary and travelled for thirty\r\nyears. He was the author of the following works: (1) \"Licht zu\r\nErleuchten die Juden,\" exalting the glory of Christ (Leipzig, 1711). (2)\r\n\"Meirath Enayim,\" a pamphlet written in German, in which the author drew\r\na parallel between Moses and Christ, shewing the supremacy of the latter\r\n(Amsterdam, 1713). (3) \"Der Abscheuliche Mord Christi,\" in which he\r\nendeavoured to demonstrate that the duration of the exile of the Jews\r\ncan be attributed only to the Crucifixion of our Lord, Hamburg, 1719.\r\n(4) \"Vera Immanuelis Generatio,\" written in Hebrew, and demonstrating\r\nthe Deity of Jesus from the prophets, especially from Isaiah vii. 14.\r\n\r\nMEYER, Hermann Edward, was born in Gross Glogau in Germany, 1796, and\r\nconverted in 1817; he studied in Halle, and became professor of law and\r\nphilology in Greifswald and in Halle. He wrote mostly about Greek laws,\r\n\"Attischen Process,\" Halle, 1824. In 1828 he became editor of the\r\n\"Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung,\" and especially contributed to the\r\n\"Allgemeine Encyklopædie\" of Ersch and Grüber. He died in 1855.\r\n\r\nMEYER, Rev. Jonas Theodor, was born in Crivitz, a small town in\r\nMecklenberg, January 30, 1819, and died in New Jersey, March 14, 1896.\r\nHis early Hebrew education he received from a Polish Jew in the Cheder,\r\nand then he was sent to relatives in Schwerin, where he studied in the\r\nGymnasium, so that at the age of fifteen he was in the first class. As\r\nfar as religion is concerned, he was taught to fear God, but he knew\r\nvery little of the love of God, so that he only lived to appease the\r\ndivine wrath by ascetic practices and good works. This did not satisfy\r\nhis soul, and he resorted to worldly pleasures, but neither did he find\r\nsatisfaction in them. At this juncture he met with the writings of R. S.\r\nHirsch, the then leader of orthodoxy, and with those of mystic Plessner,\r\nwhich awakened him somewhat from his spiritual slumber. He then began to\r\nstudy the Scriptures, and trusted to God's grace and mercy for the\r\npardon of his sins, yet he found no peace. Thereupon he came in contact\r\nwith Dr. Holdheimer, the leader of the Reformed Jews, and by him was\r\nappointed teacher in Schwerin, in 1841, and subsequently recommended as\r\nReformed rabbi to a congregation in Butzow. But the Reform movement at\r\nthat time went to extremes. The rabbis denied the belief in the Messiah\r\nat a congress, from which Meyer dissented. He was placed in a\r\npredicament between the extremes of Orthodoxy and Reform, in neither of\r\nwhich he could observe vital religion, so he began to study the New\r\nTestament. At first only its sublime ethics attracted him, but by and by\r\nit was the Person and life of Christ which drew him by the Holy Spirit\r\nto Himself. Then he met the missionary Dr. Schwarz, and from him he\r\nheard the Gospel, and attended the lectures of Neander on Galatians, and\r\nthose of Hengstenberg, on the history of the kingdom of God, on the Old\r\nTestament, and on its Christology, and was baptized by Dr. Schwarz, July\r\n18, 1847. In 1848 he left the University of Berlin and went to Scotland,\r\nand studied theology at the College of the Free Church at Aberdeen.\r\nAfterwards he became assistant Professor of Hebrew to Dr. Duncan in New\r\nCollege, Edinburgh. In 1857 he was ordained by Dr. Candish to do\r\nministerial work among the Germans in Edinburgh. In 1858 he was sent as\r\na missionary to the Jews in Galatz, Roumania, whence he was transferred\r\nin 1862 to Ancona, Italy. From there he was sent in 1867 to Amsterdam,\r\nto succeed Dr. Schwarz, who went to London. In 1871 he was requested by\r\nthe English Presbyterians to take charge of their mission in London, in\r\nwhich he laboured ardently and successfully until his retirement in\r\n1894.\r\n\r\nMOLLIS, Rev. M. L., thus writes of himself:--\"I was born in Russia of\r\nJewish parents, and in the heart of Talmudical study, zeal for\r\ntraditional observances, and great orthodoxy. My education was therefore\r\nthoroughly Jewish, and I sincerely and firmly believed in all I was\r\ntaught, both at home and in school, as being the commandments of God,\r\nand that in the keeping of them there was great reward.\r\n\r\n\"Thus far a good foundation was laid, in which I gloried and thanked God\r\nthat I was born a Jew and well brought up and instructed in the holy law\r\nof God and the prophets, and, moreover, in the Oral Law and the teaching\r\nof the wise men in Israel.\r\n\r\n\"I may also add here that I was likewise taught several modern\r\nlanguages, and received a fair secular education. For this I have to\r\nthank several members of my family at home, who cherished some higher\r\nplans in reference to my future career. My father and mother were dead,\r\nand it had been their desire that I should learn the banking business\r\nwhen I was old enough. This was not to my taste, and after trying it for\r\nawhile, I left home, and went first to Odessa and then to Roumania to\r\nvisit my uncle. I did not stop very long with him, but left the country\r\nand went eastward.\r\n\r\n\"It was during my travels abroad that I first came into contact with\r\nJewish missionaries, and heard of Jesus Christ. I had not read the New\r\nTestament before, or even heard of such a book, as far as I can now\r\nremember. I was therefore perfectly ignorant of Christianity, and knew\r\nnothing of the Gospel. Of course, I heard at home of Russian and Roman\r\nCatholic Christianity, but I was a Jew and forbidden to enquire into\r\ntheir religion, or to read their books. One thing, however, I remember,\r\nmade some impression upon me, and that occurred when I was in Odessa. I\r\nsaw there some Germans who were Lutherans, and noticed how different\r\nthey were in their lives and manners from other people around them, but\r\nI never enquired where the change came from. And so it was at first when\r\nI heard of the missionaries, for I really did not quite know their\r\nreligion and what they were teaching. I went one day out of curiosity to\r\nhear one of them read and expound some chapters on Isaiah the prophet.\r\nBut when the reader asserted that Jesus Christ was the true Messiah, I\r\nfelt indignant and strongly opposed him. It was an insult, I thought, to\r\nsuppose that the Jews were in error in regard to Jesus of Nazareth, that\r\nthe Christians were right, and that our holy religion was inferior to\r\nChristianity. I visited, however, the missionary several times\r\nafterwards, and argued with him. In the meantime the New Testament was\r\nput into my hands, and I was requested to read it. I did so, but I did\r\nnot relish it, because of the Deity ascribed therein to Jesus Christ.\r\nThis was the crucial point with me at the time. Still, I continued to\r\nread the New Testament; but, I confess it with shame, I often threw the\r\nbook away from me, or dropped it down on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Thus for two years the struggle went on, but I searched the Scriptures\r\nearnestly and diligently, and besought the Lord to help me, until, by\r\nthe grace of God, I found the truth, and Jesus Christ was revealed unto\r\nme as the suffering, despised and crucified Messiah, who endured all for\r\nmy sins, for the sins of my nation and of the whole world. The change\r\nthat came upon me was indeed great; my pride vanished, my dislike of\r\nChrist disappeared, all opposition to the truth ceased, and I felt a\r\nwonderful love to Him who first loved me, and who gave Himself for me.\r\n\r\n\"I can only speak of it now as a new creation. But it was the view of\r\nJesus Christ upon the Cross which melted my heart. I cannot explain it\r\nin words, but it was a reality, and held me fast and absorbed all my\r\nthoughts until I could almost realize the words of the prophet\r\nZechariah, 'And they shall look upon Me whom they have pierced and\r\nmourn.' And I did mourn too!\r\n\r\n\"This was no doubt the most remarkable incident in my conversion, and,\r\nlike Paul of old, I 'determined not to know anything among men, save\r\nJesus Christ and Him crucified.'\r\n\r\n\"After my baptism, I wrote home and told them of my conversion, and my\r\nfaith in Jesus Christ. There was no answer for some time, but it came at\r\nlength couched in rather mild terms, and expressing a hope that I knew\r\nbest what I had done, and had taken the step after being fully convinced\r\nthat it was the right one. But I could read between the lines that they\r\nwere grieved at home in that I had left Judaism and embraced\r\nChristianity, and thus, according to their notion, had become 'a\r\nMeshumed.' Still, my joy in the Lord increased daily, for I knew in whom\r\nI had believed.\r\n\r\n\"As to my future calling, I was uncertain for some time, although it was\r\nin my heart to preach the Gospel to my brethren, but the Lord opened a\r\ndoor for me, and I was thankful to realize that it was His doing and not\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n\"After three years' training in a college, I was appointed to labour\r\nfirst in England among the Jews, and then I went abroad and preached the\r\nGospel to Jews and Gentiles in lands beyond the seas. Whilst abroad I\r\nwas greatly blessed in my labours, and in one place I officiated in a\r\nchurch and dispensed the Word of Life to Jews and Gentiles for several\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\"Since my return to England, I have spent all my time in missionary\r\noperations among my Jewish brethren in various towns of this realm, and\r\nhave sought, by the grace of God, to lead them to Jesus Christ, the true\r\nMessiah and Redeemer.\r\n\r\n\"It has been my privilege to preach the Gospel to a very large number of\r\nJews and Jewesses during my missionary career, and the good Lord has\r\nbeen pleased to grant me tokens of His favour and approbation in souls\r\nof the House of Israel, whom I have led to the Good Shepherd, the Lord\r\nJesus Christ. I rejoice to know that I have spiritual children who are\r\nwalking worthy of their high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Some of\r\nthem are in the ministry, and others following honest callings and\r\nleading quiet Christian and useful lives to the honour and praise of\r\nGod. And I may be permitted to add that many others perhaps, though\r\nunknown to me at present, have been led to believe in Jesus Christ\r\nthrough my humble instrumentality, and who are known of God.\"\r\n\r\nMONTEFIORE, Lydia, was born a Jewess, and was the aunt of Sir Moses\r\nMontefiore, Bart. Her parents were orthodox Jews, and she was taught\r\nstrictly to observe the Sabbath as a sacred day, as well as the feasts\r\nand fasts, and other ceremonies prescribed by the law of Moses. Early in\r\nlife she was instructed in the duties enjoined by the rabbis on Jewish\r\nwomen. At the same time she had instilled into her youthful mind the\r\nlofty idea of the Unity of God, and the pre-eminence of the Jews.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of her parents she visited America, and some of the\r\ncountries of Europe, but finally took up her abode in Marseilles, where\r\nshe remained until her death. \"In March 1854,\" writes Mr. J. P. Cohen,\r\n\"I arrived in Marseilles as missionary under the auspices of the British\r\nSociety for the Propagation of the Gospel among the Jews, and in the\r\nfollowing month I was introduced to Miss Montefiore by a lady who felt a\r\ndeep interest in her spiritual welfare, but before doing so she said,\r\n'You will find her an out-and-out Jewess, and a great bigot.'\r\n\r\n\"On entering her house the lady said, 'I have brought an Israelite, Mr.\r\nCohen, and his wife to see you.' She received us very kindly, and after\r\nthe ladies had had some conversation, observing the Bible on a small\r\ntable by her side, I said, 'You read your Bible, I see.' 'Yes,' she\r\nreplied, 'it is my greatest comfort.' I took the sacred volume and read\r\nIsaiah liii., and at the close asked her what she thought of that\r\nwondrous chapter. 'I should like to hear your opinion upon it,' replied\r\nMiss Montefiore. I told her I could unhesitatingly say that it referred\r\nto the life and death of the Messiah; and that it had been literally\r\naccomplished in the person of Jesus, whom I believed to be the promised\r\nMessiah. 'Then you are a Christian,' she said. 'I am happy to say I am,'\r\nwas my reply. 'God has graciously opened my eyes to behold in Jesus my\r\npromised Redeemer.' Turning to the lady who had introduced us, she\r\nangrily said, 'I thought you told me they were Israelites?' 'So they\r\nare, true Israelites,' replied the lady. A short pause ensued, and from\r\nthe quivering of Miss Montefiore's lips and flushed cheeks, I could\r\nplainly see that her Jewish pride was roused, and with much vehemence\r\nshe said, 'I think it is most insulting to call on people, and try to\r\nconvert them from the faith of their fathers. Why not let every one\r\nremain in the religion in which they were born? I must tell you I am a\r\nthorough Jewess: I was born a Jewess, and I have lived eighty-three\r\nyears as a Jewess, and hope I shall die a Jewess.' But quickly\r\nrecovering her composure she said, 'I repeatedly hear Christians say\r\nthat they love the God of Abraham. I cannot conceive how they can do\r\nthat, and not keep the law which He gave to His servant Moses. If Christ\r\nhas done away with the law of Moses, how can He be the Messiah?' I\r\nreplied that this was one of the many erroneous ideas the Jews have of\r\nChrist. He did not come to destroy the law, or the prophets, as the Jews\r\nseemed to think, but to fulfil all that the law and the prophets wrote\r\nconcerning Him. It was He who made known the true meaning of all the\r\nMosaic ordinances and institutions. He explained their righteous\r\nprecepts, the latter of which at the time of His coming the scribes and\r\nPharisees had rendered of none effect through their traditions. Besides,\r\nI told her that God had promised to make a new covenant with us, and to\r\nwrite His law in our hearts. Here she rather abruptly interrupted, and\r\nasked where that new covenant was to be found. 'It is not in my Bible,'\r\nshe said. 'Pardon me, it is in your Bible,' and I shewed her Jer. xxxi.\r\n31-33, which she read with evident surprise.\r\n\r\n\"We conversed for a long time; Miss Montefiore shewing great interest in\r\nall I said, and as we were about to leave she pleasantly remarked, 'I\r\ncannot understand how a Jew who believes in Jesus can still be an\r\nIsraelite.' I told her not to think I ceased to be a Jew because I\r\nbelieved in the Lord Jesus, far from it; He was a Jew Himself; all His\r\nfirst disciples were Jews; He personally preached only to Jews; and it\r\nwas not till the Jews refused to listen that His apostles were sent to\r\nthe Gentiles. She seemed much pleased with this piece of Scriptural\r\ntruth, and on bidding her adieu, she asked us to call again, and said,\r\n'I shall be pleased to see you at any time, except on the Saturday,\r\nwhich day I set apart for prayer and Bible reading.'\r\n\r\n\"I soon paid her another visit, and after a little talk about passing\r\nevents our conversation turned on repentance, which appeared to be her\r\nfavourite topic. I said, 'What we want most is to have our sins\r\nforgiven; not always to be repenting of them, but to forsake them\r\naltogether. God did not say to our fathers when in Egypt, \"When I hear\r\nyou repenting I will save you,\" but He says, \"When I see the blood I\r\nwill pass over you\" (Exod. xii. 13). The blood was Israel's security\r\nthen, and it is the blood now that makes atonement for the soul (Lev.\r\nxvii. 11). 'And without shedding of _blood_ there is no remission.'\r\n\r\n\"After a little hesitation she said: 'We have no priest, no temple; the\r\nplace appointed where alone it was lawful to offer sacrifice is\r\ninaccessible to us (Jews). Surely the Almighty will not require of us\r\nthat which we cannot perform; He will mercifully accept our prayers, our\r\nfastings, our observance of the Sabbath, and the reading of the law, as\r\nI do daily, as a substitute for performing the law.' 'Dear madam,' I\r\nsaid, 'let me beg of you not to rely on such bruised reeds, nor build\r\nyour soul's salvation on such sinking sand; they are but vain excuses;\r\nthey may quiet your conscience, calm your fears, and lull you into a\r\nfalse security, which you may only discover when too late.'\r\n\r\n\"The following will shew her idea of repentance. In writing to a friend\r\nin March 1853 on this subject, she said: 'You say repentance is not\r\nsufficient for forgiveness of sins. Then why did King David say to God,\r\n\"Thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I give it; Thou delightest not\r\nin burnt offerings; the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken\r\nand a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise!\" Let us follow God's\r\ncommandments, and do unto others as we would they should do unto us, and\r\nbe patient under all adversities. But the last, I fear, I am deficient\r\nin, for I am often very irritable and impatient.'\r\n\r\n\"It was wonderful to see how her views of the Messiahship of Jesus\r\nbecame daily more distinct.\r\n\r\n\"I have just returned from a visit to our aged friend, Miss Montefiore,\r\nafter having had a most interesting conversation, or rather, I might\r\nsay, a Bible reading with her. I was greatly pleased to observe that her\r\ntone, when speaking of the Saviour, was much milder than in any of my\r\nformer visits; and her anxiety for the truth was so great that it gave\r\nme real pleasure to be with her. She said: 'All I want to know is the\r\ntruth. I shall receive nothing, unless I see it plainly revealed in my\r\nBible.' She expressed a wish to read the New Testament, and asked where\r\nshe could procure one. I told her I daily expected some Bibles and\r\nTestaments from London, and that as soon as they arrived I should be\r\nmost happy to supply her with one.\r\n\r\n\"About this time the cholera was raging in Marseilles, and hundreds were\r\ndaily cut down by this most painful epidemic; and not feeling well\r\nmyself, our friends strongly advised us to leave the town for a few\r\nweeks. During our absence the Spirit of God worked mightily in this\r\nlady's soul.\r\n\r\n\"On our return we heard she had frequently enquired after us, and often\r\nsaid, 'I miss them much, I hope they will soon return.' Accordingly\r\nMrs. Cohen did not lose any time, but called upon her at once, and was\r\nreceived by Miss Montefiore with great affection. Having been reminded\r\nof the near approach of the Day of Atonement, and 'without shedding of\r\nblood there is no remission of sin,' she said, 'Yes, I know it, and feel\r\nit more than ever. I once kept the Day of Atonement with fasting and\r\nprayer, in the vain hope of making propitiation for my sins, but I am\r\nbeginning to feel I want something better than the blood of bulls and\r\ngoats to atone for them. I often repeat those words, \"Lord, I believe,\r\nhelp Thou mine unbelief.\" 'Unbelief,' she said, 'has been, and still is,\r\nour sin; the veil is still over our people's eyes; but it shall be\r\nremoved, for God has promised it. They will not search the Scriptures as\r\nI do.' With clasped hands and uplifted eyes she said, 'I'll tell you\r\nwhat I say to the Anointed One (Jesus, I mean), \"If I have done or said\r\nanything against Thee, pardon, oh pardon me, for I did it in\r\nignorance.\"' This was indeed good news to us, and we earnestly prayed\r\nGod to deepen these convictions, to teach her by His Spirit, and give\r\nher much grace to impart them to her Jewish friends and relatives. The\r\nNew Testament which I promised, but was unable to give her on account of\r\nour sudden and unexpected departure, was supplied her by a friend during\r\nour absence, the reading of which proved a great blessing to her.\r\n\r\n\"A few days before _Yom Kippur_ she said, 'The more I read my Bible, the\r\nmore I am beginning to feel my being born a Jewess can never save me; I\r\nmust have something better than my fastings and prayers.' Every visit I\r\npaid her I could see a considerable change in her sentiments respecting\r\nthe Lord Jesus. It was pleasing to me, who had prayerfully watched her\r\nfor so many months, to observe how gradually her Jewish prejudices\r\ndisappeared, her views of the Gospel becoming more and more clear, and\r\nher love for Jesus increasing daily. It was in the beginning of October\r\n1854, she expressed a wish to be baptized, provided it could be done\r\nvery secretly, on account of her position. She said, 'I should not even\r\nlike my servant to know of it' (who had lived in her service four\r\nyears). I told her to remember that 'the fear of man bringeth a snare,'\r\nand that Jesus Christ tells us that, 'Whosoever shall deny Me before\r\nmen, him will I also deny before My Father which is in Heaven'; I also\r\nadvised her to read the tenth chapter of St. Matthew, at the same time\r\nto make it a matter of serious prayer before God, and I would do the\r\nsame, and that we would converse more on this subject at another time.\r\n\r\n\"Let me here remark that Miss Montefiore had a niece in England, who had\r\nalready embraced Christianity, and her heart's desire and prayer to God\r\nfor her aunt was, that she might be saved. Every letter she sent her\r\naunt contained some exhortation to search the Scriptures; she also\r\nforwarded her religious books; but the contents of the letters were soon\r\nforgotten; nevertheless, I believe that the first link in the chain of\r\nhuman agency in Miss Montefiore's conversion was to be found in this\r\nniece's persevering prayers for her aged relative. Not having heard from\r\nher aunt for a year, and knowing nothing of our Christian intercourse,\r\nthe lady was surprised and thankful to receive the following letter:--\r\n\r\n                                                 \"'_October_, 1854.\r\n\r\n    \"'DEAR L.,--I have at last taken courage to reply to some of your\r\n    letters, dates _n'importe_. I have read \"The Book and its Story,\"\r\n    the missionary's aid for converting the blind and the stupid. I read\r\n    it with much interest, and I pray ardently it may bring the whole\r\n    world to believe, as I now do, that Jesus Christ, God's only\r\n    begotten Son, was ordained to be crucified to take away all our\r\n    sins; and that by believing in Him we shall be saved. Madame R. lent\r\n    me the Old and New Testament bound together. The Old Testament I\r\n    almost knew by heart, but the New I had never before read. I have\r\n    studied it closely during many evenings, which has sorely pained my\r\n    eyes; but, oh, how plainly and typically the Bible shews the coming\r\n    of Messiah! I have thought so long since, before you endeavoured to\r\n    bring me to believe. Oh, my dear L., had God so ordered your abode\r\n    close to me, I should have listened better than by your letters, and\r\n    perhaps been baptized ere now. Pray keep _very secret_ the words of\r\n    this letter. I cannot say more. My heart is too full.\r\n\r\n    \"'My country residence of ten weeks did not improve my health. The\r\n    fatigue was too much for me at my time of life. I continue very\r\n    feeble. The Lord's will be done! If He heals me, I shall be healed;\r\n    if He saves me, I shall be saved. Thanks to our Heavenly Father the\r\n    cholera is over at Marseilles. I have lost my poor landlady, she\r\n    died in the country, leaving Marseilles to escape the cholera. I\r\n    went with regret, as I was not afraid. I completed last week my\r\n    eighty-first year, so excuse the defects, for my age's sake. \"He is\r\n    in the Father, and the Father is in Him.\" Amen.--Your truly\r\n    affectionate,\r\n\r\n                                             \"'LYDIA MONTEFIORE.'\"\r\n\r\n\"'What word can express my surprise,' writes that lady, 'at the\r\ndeclaration contained in the former part of this letter! An actual\r\ndeclaration in the belief of a crucified Redeemer! Over and over again\r\ndid I read the words, \"And I pray ardently that the whole world may\r\nbelieve, as I do now, that Jesus Christ, God's only begotten Son, was\r\nordained to be crucified to take away all our sins, and that by\r\nbelieving in Him we shall be saved.\" Could this be from one of whom it\r\nwas said only two years before, \"She is an out-and-out Jewess?\" The Lord\r\ndid at last convince her that Jesus was the Messiah of whom Isaiah spoke\r\nin his liii. chapter, as he writes: \"He was wounded for our\r\ntransgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of\r\nour peace was upon Him; and by His stripes we are healed. He was cut off\r\nout of the land of the living.\"' Her desire for immediate baptism daily\r\nincreased; and she frequently made it a subject of conversation with her\r\nChristian friends. At a subsequent visit she said to me, 'The Lord has\r\ngiven me a deep sense of my former sins, but I have rolled them all on\r\nJesus for pardon, and now I shall not be happy until I am baptized.' I\r\nagain told her seriously to consider the step she was about to take, in\r\ndeclaring she was not ashamed of Jesus; and asked her whether she had\r\nmade up her mind to endure persecution for Christ's sake. She said, 'My\r\nconfidence is in God; He will not lay more upon me than I am able to\r\nbear.' The conversation that day was more about faith in God, and less\r\nof man, which I was very glad to hear. At another visit, when speaking\r\nabout baptism, I said, 'Now, suppose you are baptized, and your friends\r\nshould ask you whether it was true,--what would you say?' She said, 'I\r\nwould tell them it was quite true, and that I felt assured, if they\r\nsearched the Scriptures prayerfully, as I had done, God would remove the\r\nveil from their eyes, as it has pleased Him to remove it from mine; and\r\nthen they would also believe in Jesus, the true Messiah, and in the\r\npower of His resurrection, as I have done.' It was truly delightful to\r\nsee how gradually the fear of man subsided, and her confidence in God\r\ndaily grew stronger. I accordingly introduced the Rev. J. Monod, who\r\nvery kindly visited her several times; his visits were much blessed to\r\nher; and having been satisfied with her faith in Christ, he baptized her\r\non Thursday, January 18th, 1855.\r\n\r\n\"We spent the previous evening with her, and I read St. Paul's\r\nconversion, and the sufferings of our Saviour, which affected her much,\r\nand I earnestly asked God to be with us on the following day. She said:\r\n'How thankful do I feel that the fear of man is entirely removed from my\r\nmind, so much so that I have not only told my intentions to my servant,\r\nbut have given her leave to publish it abroad, and told her, should she\r\nmeet my relations, how to tell them of it; in fact, I wish all my\r\nrelations to know it, and I pray God they may be brought to the\r\nknowledge of truth ere they die.\"\r\n\r\nMORITZ, (Moses) Johann Christian, was one of the most distinguished of\r\nthe early missionaries of the L.J.S. He was born at Bernstein\r\n(Pomerania) in 1786. His mother died when he was only four years of age.\r\nBefore she expired she blessed him, and said, \"You will live to see the\r\nadvent of the Messiah. Remain steadfastly in the faith of your fathers,\r\nthat you may have a rich share in their Kingdom.\" These words made a\r\nstrong impression upon the child and were realized by him in a different\r\nmanner than the mother expected. Moritz received a Talmudic education\r\nfrom private teachers, but modern literature attracted him most. His\r\nfather and his teacher warned him against it, and indeed they had reason\r\nfor doing so, for he began to express his doubts about the divine origin\r\nof the Talmud, and one rabbi declared that his mind was deranged and\r\nthat he would eventually become a Meshummad. On account of his\r\ndisagreement with his stepmother, Moritz left his home at the age of 16\r\nand went to Berlin to an uncle. At that time Prussia had suffered much\r\nfrom the war with Napoleon, and Moritz went to London in 1807, and\r\nbrought a recommendation to the rabbi Dr. Herschell. The rabbi received\r\nhim in a friendly manner, and warned him to beware of the missionary\r\nFrey, yet he did not regard it. The quiet Sunday in England impressed\r\nhim, and enquiring of Jews for the cause of it, they said, \"If we Jews\r\nshould keep the Sabbath holy, as the Christians here do their Sunday,\r\nthe Messiah would soon come.\" This utterance he considered as a hint to\r\nhim for seeking to become acquainted with Christianity. He then got a\r\nNew Testament and read day and night, comparing it with the Old. He felt\r\nhis sins and took refuge in Jesus by faith, which he at once confessed\r\nbefore the Jews. His father was informed of his son's intention to\r\nbecome a Christian, and he came to London and tried his best to win him\r\nback to Judaism, but had at last to leave him with imprecations and the\r\nassurance that he would never get anything of his property. Moritz went\r\nthen to the German Pastor, Dr. Steinkopf, by whom he was instructed and\r\nbaptized. In 1811, he went to Gottenburg, Sweden, where he maintained\r\nhimself by giving lessons and selling books. In 1817 he was introduced\r\nby Lewis Way to the mission, and having received a special call from the\r\nCzar Alexander he went to Russia that year and laboured till 1825. At\r\nthat time he wrote two letters to the Jews, based on Jer. xxxi. 31-34.\r\n(Elberfeld, 1820.) In 1825, after being in the Missionary College, he\r\nentered the service of the L.J.S., and was sent to Hamburg, where he at\r\nonce formed a Prayer Union. From Hamburg he itinerated to Sweden,\r\nDenmark, Russia, Bavaria, Würtemberg, receiving God's smile and blessing\r\nupon his efforts wherever he went. In 1843, he returned to Gottenburg\r\nwhere he testified to his brethren of the truth of the Gospel till 1868,\r\nwhen he died in the Lord, after 42 years service under the L.J.S. It may\r\nbe mentioned that his wife, a Swedish lady, who shared his toils and\r\nhopes with him for fifty years, died in 1864, and after her death he\r\ngave all her savings to the L.J.S.\r\n\r\nMOSSA, Nathaniel Immanuel, gives the following particulars of\r\nhimself:--\"I was born on October 29th, 1833, at Friedland, near Beskow.\r\nMy father was a Jewish merchant, first in that town, and later in\r\nSpandau, where I passed my boyhood. When I had completed my studies at\r\nthe Werder Gymnasium in Berlin I entered the University in order to\r\nstudy medicine. I graduated in 1858, and the next year passed the State\r\nExamination. I then entered the army for one year as a volunteer doctor,\r\nand was sent to Spandau, and then to Jüterberg. Here, in the hospitable\r\nhouse of Dr. Gross (later in Barmen), I learned Hahnemann's method of\r\ntreatment. After having finished my military year's practice, I settled\r\nin Bromberg, and soon found a promising sphere of activity. This,\r\nhowever, was interrupted by my participating in the military expeditions\r\nof 1864 and 1866. Also in 1870 I was called to serve in the army as\r\nphysician, and took part in the siege of Strassburg, and likewise of\r\nBelfort, and returned home with the decoration of the Iron Cross. I then\r\nrenewed my medical work at Bromberg, and continued it for twenty years,\r\nand was also a contributor to the 'General Homoeopathic Periodical.'\r\nOwing to the precarious health of my only child, I was at length\r\nobliged to exchange the northern cold climate for that of the south, and\r\nhence settled in 1883 at Stuttgart. In 1894, in addition to my medical\r\nwork, I undertook in 1894 the editorship of the above-named journal. I\r\nhave also for some years acted as President of the Committee of the\r\nSociety of Homoeopathic Physicians at Würtemberg.\r\n\r\n\"As for the story of my spiritual life, I may say, with all humility,\r\nthat our gracious Lord favoured me early in my youth. Already as a\r\nschool-boy I had the opportunity of learning the Gospel, since the Bible\r\nwas our book for reading in my first Christian school. I was at that\r\ntime much attracted by the works and utterances of Jesus, and deeply\r\ntouched by His death, and impressions perseveringly strong were made\r\nupon my mind. The instruction and earnest converse I had with two\r\nfellow-workers of the British Society, Dr. Koppel and Dr. Fürst, helped\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nThis short extract from Dr. Nathaniel Immanuel Mossa's autobiography is\r\nsupplemented by the information supplied by Pastor de le Roi concerning\r\nhim:--\r\n\r\n\"One day a Jewish Rabbi of his town asked him to give an address to\r\nJewish prisoners, and he took for his text: 'Seek ye the Lord while He\r\nis to be found, call ye upon Him while He is near,' and he illustrated\r\nthe text by the example of the prodigal son. This was the turning point\r\nin his life. He himself began to seek Him until He found Him or was\r\nfound by Him. He afterwards went to Bromberg, where he heard Koppel\r\ngiving an exposition on Isa. liii. and he joined in his labours as a\r\ndoctor in the Institution at Salem. Koppel recommended him for baptism\r\nto the L.J.S. missionary Bellson, in Berlin. Later in life he settled in\r\nStuttgart, where he was a great comfort and support to Gottheil, and\r\nafter his death, he himself acted as missionary of the British Society\r\nthere till he was called home.\"\r\n\r\nMYERS, Rev. Dr. Alfred Moritz, was born in Breslau, of strict orthodox\r\nparents. At the age of twelve his teacher was a famous Talmud rabbi, and\r\nhe lived and moved and had his being in the Talmud and in nothing else.\r\nConsequently he became disgusted with it, and when he heard that two\r\nmissionaries had arrived in Breslau, he visited them and received tracts\r\nfrom them. For this he was punished, and when his mother died, he left\r\nhis home for London in 1830, and then went to Liverpool, where he heard\r\nthe Gospel from the Rev. H. S. Joseph, and after many inward struggles\r\nwas baptized in 1839. He studied theology, and became a clergyman of the\r\nChurch of England, and a famous preacher. He was Vicar at Barnet, and\r\nafterward of All Saints, Dalston. He wrote an autobiography, \"Both one\r\nin Christ,\" London and Liverpool, 1839, \"The History of a young Jew,\"\r\nChester, 1840. \"The Jew\" translated into German, 1856. He wrote also for\r\nchildren--\"The Peep of Day,\" \"The Night of Trial,\" upon the first\r\nmissionary at Southsea, \"Line upon Line,\" \"Reading Disentangled.\" He\r\ndied in 1880.\r\n\r\nNACHIM, Rev. M., born in the town of Odessa in 1836. He writes:--\r\n\r\n\"I was initiated into the covenant on the eighth day (according to the\r\nJewish rite), and I received the name of Reuben, after my grandfather,\r\nwho had been chief rabbi. I do not know the time when I began to learn\r\nHebrew, but I do remember I was not quite eight years old when I\r\ncommenced to study the Talmud.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1854, I started on a journey to Palestine. When in\r\nConstantinople I met a Hebrew Christian colporteur named Solomon, who\r\noffered me a New Testament.\r\n\r\n\"Up to this period of my life I had never heard there was such a book in\r\nexistence! That dear Christian man induced me to visit the London Jews'\r\nSociety's missionary (the Rev. Dr. Stern). Space does not permit me to\r\ngo into detail, but that memorable visit, which lasted several hours,\r\nthanks be to our Heavenly Father, changed my future life. It was then\r\nfor the first time I heard that Christianity was not, as I had been led\r\nto believe, a system of idolatry, but based on Moses and the Prophets,\r\nand I left Dr. Stern's house with a burning desire to hear more, and\r\nlearn more about it. For two years I visited Dr. Stern constantly, and\r\nthe more I learned of the saving truth as it is in Jesus, the more\r\nagonized was my struggle; but at last, though my pillow was oft bedewed\r\nwith tears, as I realized fully what decision for Christ would involve,\r\nI was enabled by Divine grace to say, 'I count all things but loss, for\r\nthe excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have\r\nsuffered the loss of all things;' and on September 16, 1856, I was\r\nbaptized in Constantinople by my beloved spiritual father, Dr. Stern,\r\nand I then received the name of Michael (who is like unto God). From\r\nthat time I had an earnest desire to witness for Christ amongst my\r\nbrethren; and in 1860 I entered the mission field in connexion with the\r\nLondon Jews' Society, with whom I remained till November, 1869, and then\r\nI commenced my missionary labours with the British Society.\r\n\r\n\"In closing this brief outline of my life, I desire to express my deep\r\ngratitude to our gracious Lord, who has permitted me to preach the\r\nGospel of Jesus Christ in Russia, Roumania, Austria, Germany, France,\r\nItaly, Egypt, Palestine, Turkey and Bulgaria, and has blessed the\r\nmessage to many a Jewish heart, and to the salvation of many souls. I\r\nhave also been privileged to preach the Gospel to many members of my own\r\nfamily, holding influential positions in Russia, and I am thankful so\r\nsay that nine of my cousins have been baptized.\r\n\r\n\"My future is in God's hands, and my earnest prayer is, that the\r\nremainder of my life may be more fully dedicated to His service and for\r\nHis glory.\"\r\n\r\nNAPHTHALI, Israel, was one of the earliest missionaries of the British\r\nSociety. He was appointed in 1842, and laboured mostly in Manchester. In\r\n1851 he could report twenty-three converts as the fruit of his labours.\r\nIn 1870, it was recorded that through his instrumentality fifty Jews\r\nacknowledged Jesus as their Saviour, amongst whom was Aaron Sternberg,\r\nwho afterwards became an earnest missionary of the same Society.\r\nNaphthali was an earnest, spiritually-minded Christian; who reached the\r\nage of 86, and died in the Home for Aged Israelites in 1886.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL, (Julla), a North African Jew, was one of the earliest Jewish\r\nconverts in England after the Reformation. He was baptized in the parish\r\nchurch of All Hallows, Lombard Street, London on April 1, 1577, by the\r\nRev. John Fox, who preached a sermon on that occasion on Rom. xi. in\r\nLatin. That sermon was published in English by James Bell in 1587.\r\nNathaniel, too, gave an address to the congregation after his baptism.\r\n(\"Jewish Intelligence,\" 1827, pp. 28, 321, 406, 445.)\r\n\r\nNAVORSKY, son of Moses bar Hayim, who lived in the Archduchy of Posen in\r\nthe seventeenth century. His father was a tenant farmer, and when he\r\ndied the Polish nobleman, to whom the farm belonged, after demanding\r\nfrom the widow the payment of false debts, which she refused to pay,\r\ndrove her away from the farm, seized her son and had him forcibly\r\nbaptized in the Roman Catholic Church. When the Saxons invaded Poland,\r\none of their officers gave the nobleman a dog for him in exchange. This\r\nofficer, being a Christian man and a member of the Moravian brethren,\r\ntreated him kindly and instructed him in the truth of the Gospel, of\r\nwhich he had hitherto been in total ignorance. Later he joined the\r\nLutheran Church and lived a pious Christian life. He died in 1750.\r\n\r\nNEANDER, Auguste. [16] On the 17th of July in the year 1850, an imposing\r\nfuneral _cortège_ slowly wended its way through the streets of Berlin,\r\nattended by a Royal carriage and by numerous Government officials,\r\nclergymen, professors and students of the Universities of Berlin and\r\nHalle, assembled to pay their last tokens of respect and esteem to the\r\ndistinguished man who was being carried to his final resting-place.\r\nAlong the whole route from the residence of the deceased to the\r\ncemetery, a distance of two miles, immense crowds of people thronged the\r\nstreets, filling all windows, doors, and available places of\r\nobservation. Before the hearse were carried the Bible and Greek\r\nTestament of the man who had done more than any of his contemporaries to\r\nkeep alight in Germany the torch of pure and undiluted Christianity. The\r\nwhole scene was a striking tribute to the worth and work of the eminent\r\nprofessor and Church historian, Auguste Neander, who for thirty-eight\r\nyears had exercised unbounded influence in the domain of theology, not\r\nonly in the University of which he was a distinguished ornament, but\r\nalso throughout Europe. And this man was a Christian Jew, whose\r\nconversion and devotion to Christianity were destined to be fruitful in\r\ngreat results, the end of which we have hardly seen to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n[16] Biographies of Eminent Hebrew Christians, by the Rev. W. T. Gidney.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Mendel, to give him his original name, was born at Göttingen of\r\npoor Jewish parents on January 10th, 1789. He was a scion of the famous\r\nMendel family, connected by descent with the great Jewish reformer\r\nMoses Mendelssohn, whose successful efforts to elevate and uplift his\r\nthen degraded race ended in all his descendants eventually embracing the\r\nChristian faith. In the words of a modern Jewish historian, whose love\r\nof truth led her to place on record what must have cost many a regret to\r\navow:--\"As we read the story of the wise and liberal philosopher, who\r\nbroke through the barriers and let in the light of learning and of\r\nsocial countenance on mediæval benighted Judaism, we shall see that the\r\nvery children of the emancipator were dazzled by the unaccustomed rays,\r\nthat his sons wavered and his daughters apostatized, and that in the\r\nthird generation--only the third--the fetters which degraded were called\r\ndegrading, and the grandchildren of Moses Mendelssohn, the typical Jew,\r\nwere Jews no longer.\"[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n[17] Lady Magnus, \"Outlines of Jewish History,\" ch. xxxvi. p. 284.\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung David Mendel received his early education at the gymnasium or\r\npublic school at Hamburg, it being his parents' intention to bring him\r\nup in the legal profession, in which, there is very little doubt, he\r\nwould have become distinguished. In 1806, however, having, through the\r\ninfluence of two fellow-students, Chamisso the poet and another named\r\nNeumann, embraced the Christian faith, he determined to devote himself\r\nto the study of theology, and thenceforth the whole course of his life\r\nwas altered. At his baptism he had taken the Christian names of Johann\r\nAuguste Wilhelm, after those of his two friends, to which he added a\r\nnew surname, Neander, or the \"new man,\" and the new aims of his life\r\nwere thus expressed in a letter which he wrote to the pastor who had\r\nbaptized him: \"My reception into the holy covenant of the higher life is\r\nto me the greatest thing for which I have to thank you, and I can only\r\nprove my gratitude by striving to let the outward sign of baptism unto a\r\nnew life become, indeed, the mark of the new life proclaiming the\r\nreality of the new birth.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste Neander, as he was thereafter known, now entered the University\r\nof Halle, where he studied Christian dogmatics under the celebrated\r\nProfessor Schleiermacher, whose speculations in doctrinal theology\r\nverged very closely upon heterodoxy, and who is pronounced by an\r\nauthority to have been \"the greatest theological writer that Germany has\r\nproduced since Luther, and, indeed, he may be called the founder of\r\nmodern rationalism on its better side.\"[18] Intercourse with this\r\nerratic and brilliant genius produced no perceptible taint of\r\nrationalism in the mind or scholarship of the scarcely less brilliant\r\npupil, whose public teaching contrasted so powerfully with that of his\r\nerstwhile master. \"It was a sad and singular sight,\" wrote the\r\nbiographer of Neander, \"to behold his former teacher, Schleiermacher, a\r\nChristian by birth, inculcating in one lecture-room, with all the power\r\nof his mighty genius, those doctrines which lead to the denial of the\r\nEvangelical attributes of Jesus Christ, whilst in another his pupil\r\nNeander, by birth a Jew, preached and taught salvation through faith in\r\nChrist the Son of God alone.\"[19]\r\n\r\n\r\n[18] Peter Lombard, in \"Church Times\" of Nov. 21, 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n[19] \"Memoir of the Life and Writings of Dr. Neander,\" prefixed to the\r\nEnglish translation of his \"General History of the Christian Religion\r\nand Church.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Neander left Halle he repaired to his birthplace, Göttingen, to\r\npursue his theological studies in the university of which Planck was at\r\nthat time the leading spirit. It was there that Neander acquired the\r\npractice, so conspicuous in his writings, of taking nothing for granted\r\nand digging deep to the very _origines_ of things. It was this\r\ninvariable reliance solely on first hand and primitive information which\r\nmakes his literary work so valuable. In 1811 Neander became a private\r\n\"coach\" at Heidelberg, in the university of which he was appointed a\r\nprofessor of theology in the following year. Youthful as he still was,\r\nhis fame had by this time spread far and wide, and within a few months\r\nhe was elected to a similar position in the recently founded University\r\nof Berlin, which the King of Prussia desired to elevate to the foremost\r\nrank among the sister universities of his kingdom, and to make a great\r\ncentre for the teaching of theology. There Neander remained till the day\r\nof his death, fully justifying his selection as one of the leading\r\nlecturers in that seat of learning.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are the chief events in an otherwise uneventful career,\r\nentirely passed as scholar and tutor within the sheltered seclusion of\r\nuniversity life. It has been said that such an atmosphere makes for\r\nself-indulgence. Of course, it may easily degenerate into this state.\r\nAnd yet how many university dons could we name, whose saintly and\r\nscholarly lives, long hours spent in teaching, and nightly burnings of\r\nthe midnight oil give the lie to such a sweeping assertion! That it was\r\nfar from being the case with Neander the following slight sketch of the\r\nman himself, his labours and his writings, will abundantly demonstrate.\r\n\r\nNeander was of an exceedingly lovable disposition, humble-minded,\r\nretiring, pious and zealous. He was as simple as a child in the ordinary\r\nand every-day concerns of life, eccentric and singular beyond\r\ndescription, absent-minded to the last degree, and generous to a fault.\r\nHis charity was unbounded. His wants being few, he could give the bulk\r\nof his income to others. The proceeds from the sale of his numerous\r\nworks were devoted to philanthropic and missionary purposes. He could\r\nnever keep any loose cash in his pocket, or turn away his face from any\r\npoor man. If he did not part with the well-worn coat off his back it was\r\nbecause he preferred to bestow the new one hanging in his wardrobe.\r\n\r\nHis industry was prodigious. Being a single man, for he never married,\r\nhe could devote all his time and energies to his calling--which was that\r\nof scholar, writer, and lecturer. He was never ordained, and so never\r\npreached in the ministerial sense of the word; but he never lectured\r\nwithout teaching Christianity in its practical as well as doctrinal and\r\nhistorical aspect. Religion was never obscured by theology. His lectures\r\nwere attended not merely by under-graduates and students, but also by\r\nleading professors of his own and other universities--Protestants and\r\nRomanists alike sitting at his feet. Three lectures a day he invariably\r\ngave, and those on different subjects. To the students he was a father\r\nand a counsellor, ever ready to bestow, though never eager to thrust,\r\nhis advice upon all who sought it. He was universally beloved for his\r\nkindness of heart and his gentleness, and respected and admired for his\r\ntalents, scholarship, and teaching powers.\r\n\r\nThe supreme object of Neander's life, studies, and labours, is thus\r\nconcisely stated by himself in the preface of the first edition of his\r\n_magnum opus_:[20] \"To exhibit the history of the Church of Christ as a\r\nliving witness of the Divine power of Christianity, as a school of\r\nChristian experience, a voice sounding through the ages, of instruction,\r\nof doctrine and of reproof, for all who are disposed to listen.\" Neander\r\nwas not merely the historian of the dead past or _laudator temporis\r\nacti_. To him the past was indeed great, eloquent, and glorious, but he\r\nregarded it chiefly as the beginning of a greater present and a more\r\nglorious future, and as the foundation of the stately building of the\r\nChurch that is being reared throughout the ages. He had unquenchable\r\nfaith in the abiding presence of Christ in His Church, and of its\r\nconsequent power to mould and transform the world. The parables of the\r\nleaven and of the mustard seed were pregnant with meaning to him, and in\r\nhis history he elaborately traced the process of development in the\r\npast centuries--a process which amounted to a steady and ever forward\r\nprogress, even furthered by all attempts to hinder it. And this, because\r\nChristianity is a Divine power which descended from heaven at the\r\nIncarnation of Christ, and gave a new character to the life of the human\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n[20] \"General History of the Christian Religion and Church.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can well understand how exhilarating and energising such teaching as\r\nthis must have been when directed, as it was of set purpose, to\r\ncounteract the then new-fangled doctrines of Schleiermacher, and more\r\nespecially of Strauss, who in his \"Life of Christ\" had sought to\r\neliminate from Christianity all that was Divine, and therefore to\r\ndestroy its regenerative power on the hearts and lives of mankind.\r\n\r\nTo Neander, then, a Christian Jew, an immense debt of gratitude is due\r\nfrom all who hold the Catholic faith undefiled. He stemmed for a time\r\nthe tide of Rationalism which threatened to engulf in its turbid waters\r\nnot only Germany, but the whole of Christendom. His aid was expressly\r\nchartered to undo the harm caused by the speculative teaching of\r\nStrauss. When others would have suppressed the latter's work by force,\r\nNeander, discountenancing such carnal weapons, boldly and mercilessly\r\nmet his heresies by the issue of his own \"Life of Christ.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already dwelt upon his two greatest works. We can only barely\r\nmention the others. They were, to give them their titles in\r\nEnglish--\"The History of the Planting and Training of the Christian\r\nChurch by the Apostles,\" \"Biographies of Julian the Apostate, St.\r\nBernard and St. Chrysostom,\" \"Anti-Gnostikus, Development of the Gnostic\r\nSystem,\" \"Memorabilia from the History of the Christian Life,\" \"Unity\r\nand Variety of the Christian Life,\" numerous essays contributed to\r\nreligious periodicals, and \"Memoirs of the Proceedings of the Berlin\r\nRoyal Academy of Sciences.\"\r\n\r\nNeander's restless activity doubtless shortened his life, and death\r\novertook him before the work which he had set himself to do was done. He\r\nhad completed his \"General History\" only to the middle of the fourteenth\r\ncentury. He died whilst dictating a page of this unfinished history,\r\nwith the words, \"I am weary; I must sleep; good night;\" upon his lips.\r\nTo another famous historian, Bede, it was granted to see, but only just\r\nto see, the completion of his labours. When dying, the amanuensis who\r\nwrote for him his translation into Saxon of the Gospel according to St.\r\nJohn, said: \"Master, there is but one sentence wanting.\" Bede answered:\r\n\"Write quickly!\" and when the sentence was written, he replied: \"Thou\r\nhast the truth--_consummatum est_,\" and with the _Gloria Patri_ upon his\r\nlips, he breathed his last. Neander's work is like a broken column, and\r\nyet who shall say it had been better otherwise? Surely not those who\r\nbelieve that \"man is immortal, until his work is done.\"\r\n\r\nNEANDER, Rev. John, thus wrote of his conversion to a sincere\r\nacquaintance:--\"My dear friend,--Cheerfully do I respond to your call,\r\nand as briefly as possible will I relate to you, how wonderfully God\r\nhas dealt with me; how He, the Almighty God, looked down upon me while I\r\nwas yet deeply sunk; how He called me, and lifted me up from the dust;\r\nand how He brought me out of darkness into His marvellous light; praised\r\nbe His name. Amen.\r\n\r\n\"I was born in the year 1811 at Neubrûck, in the province of Posen. My\r\nparents were strict Talmudical Jews, my father especially, a zealous,\r\nlearned Talmudist. They had consecrated me to the office of a rabbi,\r\neven while I was at my mother's breast; which office being considered\r\nthen, as it still is, a most holy vocation. On my having attained my\r\neighth year, and being able to read Hebrew, my father engaged for me a\r\nteacher of the Talmud, who resided in the house, and from early in the\r\nmorning until late at night he laboured with me in the Talmud; now and\r\nthen he also read the Pentateuch and Jarchi's Commentary with me.\r\n\r\n\"Until I was twenty-three years old, I studied at different Talmudical\r\nschools in Posen, and having attained to that degree which qualified me\r\nfor the office of a rabbi, I returned to my father's house, where I\r\ndevoted myself entirely to the study of the Talmud. You are well\r\nacquainted with the course of life led at rabbinical schools; I have\r\ntherefore no occasion to give you here an account thereof. I lived\r\nearnestly engaged in this study, because it was my parents' warmest\r\nwish; and I moreover hoped thereby to attain to a high position amongst\r\nmy nation, and flattered myself that I should hereby be qualified for\r\nthe community of the Chassidim, and consequently to reach the presence\r\nof God.\r\n\r\n\"I plunged myself into the deep labyrinth of rabbinical subtleties and\r\nsophistry; entangled myself in a chain, composed of thousands of links\r\nof trivialities; exhausted myself in endeavouring to be enlightened on\r\nthis, or on that matter; but I only got deeper and deeper into the\r\nlabyrinth; not a ray of light penetrated its dark recesses. At length\r\nthe employment became exceedingly disagreeable to me; the zeal which was\r\nso ardent in my youth (alas! it was a blind zeal), cooled more and more\r\nin proportion as it became clearer to me that the words of the different\r\nrabbis, the former and latter, are truly not agreeable to God's most\r\nHoly Word; and I discovered, that the persuasion that their ways lead to\r\nthe truth is a vain persuasion.\r\n\r\n\"I was about twenty-five when with a painful heart I perceived this. I\r\nhad no firm foundation to rest upon; nothing on which to lay hold. I\r\nstood as on broken ground; my heart torn, and nigh to perish with\r\nanguish. About this time I was teacher in a town in Germany, where I had\r\nabove twenty pupils, whom I had to educate, and bring up as men and\r\nIsraelites; and every Saturday I had to deliver a public lecture on\r\nportions of the Old Testament. All this placed me in a terrible\r\ncondition; I had to preach up and defend that, against which my heart\r\nrevolted; dissemble I would not, yea, I could not.\r\n\r\n\"In the early period of my life as a teacher, I was zealous for the\r\nrabbinical Judaism of the present day. I tormented and exhausted myself\r\nendeavouring, by the works of the law, to lead a life pure and holy\r\nbefore my God; for even when a child I conceived sin to be an abhorrence\r\nto God; the thunders of Sinai sounded and resounded in my heart; the\r\nmighty word proceeding out of the mouth of the Almighty God, 'cursed is\r\nhe who does not keep my law,' pressed me down to the ground at that\r\nearly period of my life; as with flaming letters it was written in my\r\nheart, 'God is a holy God! God is a righteous God! who abhors sin; in\r\nwhose presence, none but those who are pure, and free from sin, and who\r\nlive for him only, can abide.' From all my toil, however, I found no\r\npeace; far, far from me was the rest for which I so much longed.\r\n\r\n\"I had intercourse with a few individuals who called themselves\r\nChristians. I sought them out for the purpose of discussing with them\r\nscientific subjects, and now and then to study the Old Testament with\r\nthem; of these some were students in theology, and others teachers; they\r\nused to assail the revealed word of God most terribly. Through them I\r\nbecame acquainted with the criticisms of de Wette, Eichhorn, Dinter, and\r\nothers, and it was not long that I stood up a zealous defender of modern\r\nJudaism; I became a rationalist. We are deceived! exclaimed I to my\r\ncommunity, terribly deceived! the Talmud and the Psakim are a tissue of\r\nerrors, and so forth. Still the storm in my heart did not subside; it\r\ncontinued to roar and to rage; I was not free; before it was chains of\r\nsuperstition that shackled my heart, now those of unbelief; chains\r\nforged by profane hands, by such fools as say, 'There is no God.'\r\n\r\n\"As I looked on these contradictions, and on this work of ungodly men, I\r\ntrembled, and entered the field against these impudent deniers of God;\r\nbut with weapons, alas! I knew not at that time, and so I was in a\r\nterrible condition. I felt as if closed in by a wall; I panted after the\r\nbreath of life; I longed after liberty, and hoped that the enigma would\r\nsolve itself; but far off appeared to me the hand which should lead me\r\ninto the haven of peace; and the light which I searched after in all the\r\nwritings of men, proved but darkness; they were broken cisterns, and my\r\nsoul, which was languishing and nigh to perishing, did not find the\r\nwater of life. I lay at times the whole night on the hard floor,\r\nchastised my body, yearned and cried aloud. The old Jews, to whose\r\nknowledge these austerities came, held me for a saint; and the modern\r\nJews said to me: 'Don't be a fool.' Oh! these were years of anguish and\r\nterror; I was often nigh to despair. The compassion and grace of God,\r\nwhom I did not know at that time, alone held me up; the hand of the\r\nmighty covenanted God of my forefathers covered me, and it was His\r\neternal love that preserved me from sinking.\r\n\r\n\"I tore myself with force from the circle of those who surrounded me,\r\nand I was chiefly alone and secluded. I betook myself, as it were, to a\r\ndesert of books. Alas! the speculations of men only filled my head,\r\nwhile my heart remained empty. My thirst after the truth, after God's\r\ntruth, was not quenched; I read now and then in the Pentateuch; but the\r\nbooks of the Old Testament were locked up to me, and the old and new\r\ncommentaries of the rabbis did not satisfy me. That the New Testament is\r\na key to the Old I had not the least conception at that time; and, as I\r\nwas then an enemy to Christianity, I never read the New Testament.\r\n\r\n\"At this time of severe struggle, I received a visit from my father, to\r\nwhom I communicated my distress of mind; it pained him deeply, and he\r\npressed me to return home with him immediately. To my question, 'What\r\nshall I do then?' he replied, 'You shall do nothing else but learn the\r\nTorah, you have no occasion to trouble yourself about earthly things,\r\nand as soon as you shall be seated in the circle of the Chassidim and\r\nstudents of the law, it will be well with you.' Family matters obliged\r\nmy father to return quickly, and I begged him to allow me to remain for\r\na short time longer in Germany, until I should be enlightened on that\r\nwhich distressed me so much. Shortly after that I was sent for by a\r\nJewish community, in the north of Germany. I hurried thither with joy,\r\nwhere I took possession of a very pleasant post.\r\n\r\n\"My heart, however, remained wounded, and peace was far from me. The\r\nJews of that place were very indifferent about religion, and it was not\r\nrequired that I should deliver a public lecture on the Sabbath. I looked\r\nfor religious men, but amongst the Jews there was not one in whom there\r\nwas a striving after the only good; my exhortation to them to elevate\r\nthemselves to the fulness which cometh from God, and my admonitions,\r\nwere all in vain; nevertheless, the pupils clung to me with much love;\r\nand they listened to me attentively when I related to them the history\r\nof the kingdom of God in the time of the Old Testament dispensation.\r\n\r\n\"But my heart continued cold even here; the great deeds of God filled me\r\nwith awe, and the history of our people, as well as my own course of\r\nlife, only opened more the wounds of my heart. 'The Balm of Gilead' I\r\nknew not, and the instruction I imparted was only mechanical, without\r\nlife, and without warmth.\r\n\r\n\"I visited the clergymen of this town, and I found some of them\r\ndifferent from any I had seen before; they talked of the revealed word\r\nof the Old Testament, with warmth of heart and enthusiasm, and I heard\r\nfor the first time a powerful testimony to the Christian doctrine; my\r\nwhole heart was stirred up against it, the ground burned under my feet,\r\nand I hurried away purposing never to return again.\r\n\r\n\"Still there remained a thorn in my heart. The fifty-third chapter of\r\nIsaiah as well others in the Old Testament, to which my attention was\r\ndrawn, were too strong for me; doubt raged in me, and the questions,\r\nWhat if it be really true? What if the Christians are right? left me no\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\"A few weeks elapsed, and I could no longer endure my trouble; I greatly\r\ndesired to be enlightened, and that, by means of the common medium of\r\nall truth, Holy Writ alone.\r\n\r\n\"I began to read the New Testament, and to compare it with the Old, and\r\nit wonderfully unfolded itself to me; more and more I discovered the\r\ngreat mystery of redemption. In the Old Testament, in all God's\r\ncontrivances, a voice called to me, and I heard the voice of God,\r\nthrough Moses and the prophets, saying: Jesus Christ the crucified, is\r\nthe true Messiah, the true Saviour, whose name is Jehovah Tsidkenu, the\r\nLord our Righteousness. I was roused especially by the ninth chapter of\r\nthe Acts; I was made acquainted, after much wrestling and fervent\r\nprayer, that Jesus is the source of salvation, and of eternal life to\r\nall, who, by the efficacy of His blood, are cleansed from the guilt and\r\npollution of sin, and through Him can call God, Abba, Father. I\r\nperceived that faith in the triune God is the victory which vanquishes\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\"I could not remain silent about this; my heart was filled with it; I\r\ntasted the friendship of God, I rejoiced and was constrained to exclaim,\r\n'My Redeemer liveth;' and this I announced to my pupils, talked of it in\r\nthe circles of Jewish families, and publicly and aloud gloried in the\r\nground of my hope in the rich promise vouchsafed to me, by the mouth of\r\na mighty covenant God: Be comforted, all thy sins are forgiven thee, thy\r\ndebt is paid and annulled, through the great and only atoning sacrifice,\r\nthrough 'the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.'\r\n\r\n\"There was a tremendous tumult among the Jews; some of them came to me,\r\nand gave themselves much trouble by various means to turn me away from\r\nthe Lord, mine and my father's God. The community wrote all about it to\r\nmy father, from whom I received a letter which placed me in a most\r\npainful position. He prayed and cried, 'Come to us, and remain a Jew.'\r\nMy mother received from this news a severe blow, and she was laid on a\r\nbed of sickness, and great were her sufferings; my sisters, brothers,\r\nand relatives mourned in secret. It was a hard struggle--life and death\r\ndepended on my decision.\r\n\r\n\"I cried and wept bitterly, and riveted myself firmly to the word of\r\nlife, that alone should be my guide, my stay, and my staff; and praised\r\nbe God, the Sun of Righteousness lighted me, and His beams fell warm and\r\nfull of life on my heart.\r\n\r\n\"'Whoso loveth father and mother more than Me, is not worthy of Me.'\r\nThis was spoken by Him who has power to save and to condemn. I could not\r\ndo otherwise than obey Him, who once said to the patriarch Abraham, 'Get\r\nthee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's\r\nhouse, unto a land that I will show thee.' I was obliged to tear asunder\r\nthe ties which bound me to my beloved relatives, who still remain dear\r\nto me; painful as it is to flesh and blood, I was constrained to do so\r\nfor the Lord's sake; and I exclaimed aloud in the presence of the Jews\r\nwho at this time surrounded me, and who, not knowing what they did,\r\nendeavoured to hurl me down to the abyss of destruction: 'I cannot do\r\notherwise, I must acknowledge Him, I must believe on Him, who is my\r\nRedeemer and Saviour; His name is Jesus Jehovah; I cannot do otherwise,\r\nshould they on account of it cut me in pieces. Woe unto me, if I deny\r\nHim, the Lord Jesus; therefore it is well with me, that I perceived\r\nthrough the grace of God, that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and\r\nthe life, praised be His name. Amen.'\r\n\r\n\"Now was I able to rejoice, and with David to exclaim, 'Bless the Lord,\r\nO my soul, and forget not all His benefits' (Psalm ciii. 2).\r\n\r\n\"After I had been duly instructed in the saving truth of the Gospel, I\r\nwas publicly baptized in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, on\r\nDecember 9th, 1839, by the Rev. Mr. Müller.\"\r\n\r\nNEUMAN, Rabbi, was converted through his intercourse with a Christian\r\nmerchant in Leeuwarden, Holland. He afterwards translated the tract,\r\n\"Light at Eventide,\" into Dutch. (\"Jewish Intelligence,\" 1855.)\r\n\r\nNEUMAN, Dr. R., was born at Brody in 1788. His father was a rabbi and\r\ngave him a Talmudical education. In 1807 he came to Dessau in Germany,\r\nwhere he wrote a Commentary on Amos, Nahum and Malachi, and became a\r\ndirector of a free school for poor children at Breslau. Through his\r\nintercourse with two Christian professors, and especially with the\r\nL.J.S. missionaries McCaul and Becker in 1823, he learned to know Jesus\r\nas his Saviour, and was baptized there, together with his wife and three\r\nsons, by Professor Scheibel, in the Elizabeth Church. A Dr. Cohen, who\r\nwas a teacher under him, followed his example. Subsequently he rendered\r\nservice to the L.J.S. by revising the text of the Hebrew New Testament.\r\nHe died in 1865.\r\n\r\nNEUMANN, Karl Friedrich, was born in Reichmansdorf in 1793, studied at\r\nHeidelberg and Munich, and was baptized at Munich in the Evangelical\r\nChurch in 1818. Subsequently he went to Venice and studied Armenian. In\r\n1828 he went to Paris, and in 1829 to London, and from there to China.\r\nThere he collected several thousand volumes of all branches of\r\nliterature, which are now in the library of the Munich University. He\r\nbecame professor in 1833, M.P. in 1848. In 1863 he retired to Berlin,\r\nwhen he died in 1870. Some of his works are the following:--\"Die Völker\r\ndes südlichen Russlands\" (Leipzig, 1847.) \"Geschichte des Englischen\r\nReiches in Asien\"; \"Geschichte der Afghanen\"; \"Geschichte Oestreichs\";\r\n\"Geschichte der Vereinigten Staaten.\" A translation of Gützlaff's\r\n\"History of the Chinese Empire\"; \"Geschichte der Armenischen\r\nLiterature,\" Leipzig, 1834, and English translations of Armenian\r\nChronicles.\r\n\r\nNEWMAN, Rev. C. S., was first in the service of the Scotch Church and\r\nlaboured at Jassy and at Constantinople. In 1855 he resigned, and after\r\njoining the Church of England was sent by the L.J.S. to Constantinople,\r\nwhere he laboured successfully until he was called to higher service.\r\n\r\nNEWMAN, Rev. Louis, a convert and student of the L.J.S., was ordained in\r\nthe American Episcopal Church, and laboured among the Jews in\r\nPhiladelphia with blessed results all his life. He was a great Hebrew\r\nscholar.\r\n\r\nNURNBERG, Rev. Nahum, was born in Russia, his father dying very early.\r\nHis mother and her children then went to live with her father, who was a\r\nstrict Jew, and as such Nahum was brought up. When about nine years old\r\nan uncle adopted him and took him to Breslau to be educated. He became a\r\nfavourite with the proctor of the University there and at Berlin, and\r\nthrough them he obtained a good deal of tuition. He also did\r\njournalistic work, and in 1851 he came over to England to report on the\r\nGreat Exhibition. He stayed on in Hull as a correspondent. Whilst there\r\nhe came under the influence of the Rev. John Deck, by whom he was\r\neventually baptized. Later on he was, after finishing his course at the\r\nL.J.S. missionary college, appointed a missionary of that Society, first\r\nin England, and then in Roumania, but returned to this country as his\r\nreal home after a year's work, owing to the death of his wife. Soon\r\nafter he took orders, and engaged in parochial work, until 1879, after\r\nwhich he retired, until his much lamented death on January 30th, 1904.\r\n\r\nOCZERET, Rev. Leo, a native of Tarnopol, Galicia, was converted in\r\nJerusalem, and studied afterwards at the college of the L.J.S. in\r\nLondon. His Jewish _fiancée_ also became a Christian. After being\r\nstationed in Paris for about two years he was sent to Jerusalem and was\r\nordained by Bishop Hannington. In 1884 he was sent to reopen the mission\r\nat Safed, and at first he had trouble with the spirit of fanaticism\r\nwhich had ever existed among the Jews there; but gradually, by patience\r\nand love, he won the hearts of many, so that when he became ill they\r\ncame to visit and console him. One old man even assured him that during\r\na whole fortnight he recited fifty Psalms (according to the custom of\r\npious Jews during illness) for his recovery. Oczeret went at last to a\r\nhospital in Vienna, whence he wrote to the Committee, \"Let the Lord's\r\nwill be done! Pray for us all. I do not give up every hope yet to work\r\nfor my Lord and Master, and to serve faithfully the Committee, to whom I\r\nam wont to look as to a father.\" But though still young, he had finished\r\nhis course, and went to receive the crown of glory.\r\n\r\nPALGRAVE (Cohen), Sir Francis, born in London, July 1788, died there\r\nJuly 6th, 1861, son of Mayer Cohen, a member of the London Stock\r\nExchange. He was an infant prodigy. At the age of eight he made a\r\ntranslation of Homer's \"Battle of the Frogs\" into French, which was\r\npublished by his father (London, 1796). He embraced Christianity, and\r\nmarried a daughter of Dawson Turner, the historian. He was called to the\r\nbar in 1827, devoting himself to pedigree cases. In 1832 he published\r\n\"The Rise and Progress of the English Commonwealth,\" which is generally\r\nregarded as the earliest important study of English constitutional\r\nhistory founded on the records. He was knighted in that year, and became\r\ndeputy-keeper of Her Majesty's records, in which capacity he issued\r\ntwenty-two annual reports of great historic value. His most important\r\nwork is \"A History of Normandy and England,\" 4 vols., London, 1851-63.\r\nPalgrave had four sons each of whom attained distinction of various\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nPALGRAVE, Francis Turner (1824-1902), editor of the \"Golden Treasury of\r\nEnglish Songs and Lyrics,\" Professor at Oxford.\r\n\r\nPALGRAVE, Robert Harry Inglis (born 1827), editor of \"The Dictionary of\r\nPolitical Economy.\"\r\n\r\nPALGRAVE, Sir Reginald Francis Dunce (1829-1903), Clerk of the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\nPALGRAVE, William Gifford (1826-88), Eastern traveller and author of \"A\r\nYear's Journey through Central and Eastern Arabia\" (London, 1865) and\r\nother works.\r\n\r\nPALOTTA, Professor C. W., a native of Hungary, by birth and education a\r\ngentleman. Coming to England early in the sixties of the nineteenth\r\ncentury he was induced by a friend to attend the lectures and classes of\r\nDr. Ewald, and after due instruction was baptized in the Jews' Chapel,\r\nPalestine Place. Not long after, he was sent by L.J.S. as missionary\r\nassistant to the Rev. F. G. Kleinhenn, at Bucharest, whose daughter he\r\nmarried. From 1866 he laboured for two years itinerating through Servia\r\nand Bosnia. He was the first missionary who took the Gospel to the Jews\r\nin those countries. In 1868 he was stationed at Jassy, where he laboured\r\nuntil 1871, when he settled at Vienna as a professor of languages.\r\nPalotta was a gifted man and zealous missionary, and throughout his\r\nChristian life he took a great interest in the mission to the Jews, and\r\nvoluntarily helped them in Vienna and also in Paris during the\r\nexhibition in 1879.\r\n\r\nPAULI, Rev. C. W. H., was born in Breslau in 1800 and was named Zebi\r\nNasi Hirsch Prince. His father who was a rabbi, gave him a thorough\r\nrabbinic education. Already at the age of 21, being then a religious\r\nteacher, he published \"Sermons for Pious Israelites,\" in which he\r\nemphasized the teaching of the Bible rather than that of the Talmud.\r\nWhilst thus endeavouring to teach pure Mosaism he came in contact with\r\nthe L.J.S. missionary, C. G. Petri of Detmold, and received from him a\r\nNew Testament, of which he began to make use in his teaching. The Jews\r\nthen declared him crazy, and he resigned his office and went to Detmold.\r\nFrom there he was sent to Minden, where he was baptized December 21st,\r\n1823. His sponsors were Baron Blomberg and Major Grabowski. The former,\r\nwho through the influence of the L.J.S. founded the mission at Detmold,\r\nthen recommended Pauli as a missionary to the Posen Society. A year\r\nlater he went with Petri to England and studied at Cambridge. From there\r\nhe was called to be Lecturer of Hebrew at Oxford. In this capacity he\r\nlaboured there for thirteen years, during which time he wrote various\r\nbooks, his \"Analecta Hebraica\" deserving special mention. In 1840 he\r\nreceived a call from the L.J.S. to go as a missionary to Berlin, where,\r\nby his learning and piety and loving disposition, he made a salutary\r\nimpression upon the Jews. In 1844 he was transferred to Amsterdam, and\r\nlaboured there till 1874. The results of his activity there appeared\r\nfrom time to time in the \"Jewish Intelligence.\" He then retired to\r\nLuton, where he died in 1877, with the words upon his lips: \"Into Thy\r\nhands, O God, I commend my spirit. My Saviour is near.\"\r\n\r\nPAULY, a Jewish savant, was baptized at Hamburg in 1810. He lived with\r\nan unbelieving brother in Berlin, at the time when Pauli was stationed\r\nthere, who had the privilege of administering the Sacrament of the\r\nLord's Supper to him on his dying bed when he was eighty years of age\r\n(Annual Report, 1843, p. 60).\r\n\r\nPHILIPPI, Dr. Friedrich Adolf, was born in Berlin in 1809. His father\r\nwas a banker and belonged to the circle of the Mendelssohns. Philippi\r\nreceived Christian impressions at school, and in riper years he received\r\nfrom a fellow student a treatise entitled \"Glocktöne,\" by Court Chaplain\r\nStrauss, which caused him to attend his sermons. His uncle Jakobi, the\r\nmathematician, had at that time become an Evangelical Christian. This\r\nevent, too, caused him to seek for the truth until he found it for\r\nhimself and was then baptized by Pastor Zehme in Grossstädtel, near\r\nLeipzig, in 1829. Later on he studied theology under Hengstenberg, and\r\nbecame professor at Dorpat and later at Rostock. He was the author of\r\nthe following works:--\"Die Lehre von dem thätigen Gehorsam Christi,\"\r\n1841; \"Glauben's Lehre,\" 1853; a posthumous work, published by his son,\r\n\"On the Epistle to the Galatians and the Synoptics.\" He died on August\r\n29, 1882.\r\n\r\nPICK, Aaron, Biblical scholar, was born at Prague, where he was\r\nconverted to Christianity and lectured on Hebrew at the University. He\r\nlived in England during the first half of the nineteenth century, and\r\nwas the author of translations and commentaries of various books of the\r\nBible. His works comprised a literal translation from the Hebrew of the\r\ntwelve Minor Prophets (1833), of Obadiah (1834), and of the seventh\r\nchapter of Amos, with a commentary. In 1837 he produced a treatise on\r\nthe Hebrew accents, and in 1845 he published, \"The Bible Student's\r\nConcordance.\" He was besides the author of a work entitled, \"The\r\nGathering of Israel or the Patriarchal Blessing as contained in the\r\nForty-ninth chapter of Genesis. Being the Revelation of God concerning\r\nthe twelve Tribes of Israel, and their ultimate Restoration.\"\r\n\r\nPICK, Abraham, a native of Senftenberg, Bohemia, was influenced by his\r\nbrother Israel to examine the evidences of Christianity, and then had\r\nintercourse with a Scotch missionary, the Rev. Daniel Edward, in 1866,\r\nand at last was brought to the Lord by the Rev. Abraham Herschell, who\r\nalso baptized him in 1869 at Stuttgart together with his wife. His\r\ndaughter Catharine was already baptized through Edward, at Breslau in\r\n1857. His daughters, Rosie and Philippine, were baptized at Kaiserswerth\r\nby the Scotch Free Church missionary, Van Andel, and his daughter Regina\r\nand his son Joseph were baptized at Kornthal in 1878. His daughters\r\nCharlotte and Therese were baptized in Switzerland by Pastor Bernoulli,\r\nand Elizabeth was baptized by Pastor Axenfeld in Cologne. The whole\r\nfamily became in various ways useful workers in the service of the\r\nMaster, and in 1879 they had the joy of knowing that seven of their\r\nrelatives had confessed Christ in baptism. Abraham Pick became\r\nafterwards the agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society at\r\nLemberg, where he laboured for many years in spreading the Word of God\r\nin Galicia and in the Bukowina, where he and his family were almost the\r\nonly sympathizing friends of the L.J.S. missionaries.\r\n\r\nPICK, Israel, a brother of the above, had received a strict Talmudical\r\neducation. When he came to the age of discretion he began to waver\r\nbetween rabbinic orthodoxy and freethought, but he felt an inward call\r\nto do something great for the emancipation of his brethren and for\r\nrestoring the Jewish kingdom. At first he was engaged in journalistic\r\nwork at Vienna, and then he became a preacher and teacher in a synagogue\r\nat Bucharest, where he endeavoured to infuse vital religion into the\r\ncongregation, but had to leave them disappointed. His enthusiasm for the\r\ntemporal and spiritual welfare of his people caused him to correspond\r\nwith missionaries and to lay before them a plan for the establishment of\r\na Hebrew Christian National Church. He also addressed a letter to that\r\neffect to the Jews in Amsterdam in 1853, but received no encouragement\r\nanywhere. At last he embraced Christianity and was baptized by Daniel\r\nEdward at Breslau in 1854. On this occasion he wrote: \"A Word to my\r\nPeople,\" afterwards \"The Star of Jacob,\" \"Kol nidre night,\" \"Is there no\r\nPhysician there?\" In all these writings he displayed almost a\r\nprophetical spirit, speaking from the fulness of a heart inflamed with\r\nlove to his people, and no less to his Saviour. This enthusiasm led him\r\neventually in 1859 to Jerusalem, and then he was heard of no more. The\r\nprobability is that he was killed somewhere in Palestine.\r\n\r\nPICK, Joseph, after studying in Basel and in the L.J.S. College, was\r\nappointed missionary at Strassburg in 1877, and in 1888 he was\r\ntransferred to Cracow. He was a gifted and an energetic man and laboured\r\nin both places under peculiar difficulties. In 1897 he visited London,\r\nand on his return died rather suddenly, his loss being deeply felt by\r\nall who knew him.\r\n\r\nPICK, Rev. Dr. Bernard, was baptized in Berlin in 1861. Later he went to\r\nthe United States, where he studied theology and was appointed to a\r\nchurch at Rochester, New York. He was a prolific writer. The following\r\nwere from his pen: \"The Mission among the Jews,\" in the Encyclopædia of\r\nBiblical, theological and ecclesiastical literature (New York, 1881, pp.\r\n166-177). \"The Talmud, what it is and what it knows about Jesus and His\r\nfollowers\" (New York, 1887). \"Luther as a Hymnist,\" 1888. \"Historical\r\nSketch of the Jews since the destruction of Jerusalem,\" 1887.\r\n\r\nPIERITZ, G. Wildon, born at Klecko in Posen, in 1808, baptized 1835,\r\nlaboured as a missionary of the L.J.S. in the forties of the nineteenth\r\ncentury at Jerusalem, in Damascus, and subsequently settled at Oxford,\r\nwhere he was engaged in teaching. He was a learned and spiritually-minded\r\nman, as his articles in the \"Hebrew Christian Witness, 1874-5,\" testify.\r\nHe was the author of \"The Gospels from the Rabbinical Point of View,\"\r\nLondon and Oxford, 1873.\r\n\r\nPIERITZ, Rev. Joseph Abraham, was a missionary of the L.J.S., stationed\r\nat Bristol in 1844, and laboured amongst the Jews generally in the West\r\nof England, also in Dublin and other places. He afterwards went out to\r\nBritish Guiana, and became rector of the parish of St. Patrick, Berbice,\r\nwhere he died in 1869, aged sixty-five, as the result of a carriage\r\naccident. His funeral was taken by the Bishop, and was attended by over\r\n2,000 persons.\r\n\r\nPOLAN, Rev. Mark, was born at Wilna, a town known as the \"Jerusalem of\r\nLithuania,\" where a high type of Judaism prevailed and where Rabbinical\r\nlearning flourished, and where also the Greek churches mostly\r\nrepresented a sensuous and ritualistic Christianity. At Wilna there is a\r\nflourishing trade in cereal products, and Mark's father was a corn\r\nmerchant. His parents gave him a rigorous religious training. His mother\r\ncould speak Hebrew well, and the boy was instructed in the Talmud and\r\nother Rabbinical writings. As an illustration of the sectarian rigour of\r\nthe Jews at Wilna, it may be mentioned that a law having been passed\r\ncompelling education in the Russian language, the Jews proclaimed a Fast\r\nand made provision for the private tuition of their children.\r\n\r\nYoung Polan left his native place in 1872 intending to proceed to\r\nAustralia and join a relative there. A change of plan, under pressure\r\nfrom home, led him to linger first at Königsberg and then in London. In\r\nLondon he soon came in contact with missionaries. His aim, however, was\r\nnot enquiry but opposition. Rumours then reached his friends that he had\r\nbecome a Meshummad, but careful enquiries satisfied them that their\r\nsuspicions were mistaken and he was left unmolested.\r\n\r\nBut the living God was also watching and guiding. Gradually his attitude\r\nto Christianity began to change. For one thing, the absence of images in\r\nthe English churches made an impression upon him. The first Christian\r\nbook that he read was the \"Pilgrim's Progress\" in Hebrew. Then there\r\ncame eager readings of Commentaries written on St. Luke, Acts, Romans\r\nand Hebrews by Dr. Biesenthal, once a rabbinical Jew; he was thus led to\r\na careful study of the New Testament. In the Rev. Theodore Meyer the\r\nenquirer at last found a wise and loving instructor and friend. From the\r\nfirst, Mr. Meyer's erudition and sincerity drew forth the confidence and\r\ninterest of the young Jew.\r\n\r\nAfter four years' instruction, Mr. Polan came forward for baptism, and\r\nit was arranged to take place in Park Church, Highbury. An incident,\r\nhowever, happened which led to its postponement. On the eve of his\r\nproposed baptism he had a dream which led him to withdraw, and was the\r\ncause of severe and protracted mental struggles. It is said by the\r\nrabbins, and believed by the Jews, that in Paradise a dark veil is made\r\nto hang before the parent whose child has become an \"apostate.\" In his\r\ndream Polan saw his mother in Paradise behind the dark curtain. The\r\neffect upon his mind was such that he could not face baptism; nor did\r\nhe, until nearly a year afterwards. It may have been that the first\r\ndecision was resting mainly upon mental conviction of the truth. At any\r\nrate, there followed more serious consideration and prayerful searching\r\nof the Scriptures, with the result that a certain word of the Lord\r\nreached his heart and touched it with signal power. The word was: \"Let\r\nnot your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in Me.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the power of this word this earnest seeker emerged into the light.\r\nUltimately, in 1878, he openly confessed Christ by baptism, the\r\nordinance being administered by Mr. Meyer in Park Church, Highbury.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable ostracism and persecution, with their attendant\r\nsufferings, followed. It was a welcome mitigation to the new convert's\r\ntrials that his father did not entirely cast him off. And the spirit in\r\nwhich he suffered may be gathered from the reply he sent to his brothers\r\nand sisters, when, at his father's death, they hurled over him their\r\nanathemas, telling him that his name had been expunged from the family\r\nregister. \"It has caused me great pain,\" he wrote to a friend, \"but\r\nthough my name is not now in the family tree, it can be found in the\r\nLamb's Book of Life.\"\r\n\r\nIn those days Mr. Polan was a member of Park Church, Highbury. The\r\npastor at the time was Dr. Edmond, who, with Mr. Meyer, proved a\r\nspiritual father to the young Hebrew Christian. There he was surrounded\r\nby strong missionary influences, and through the Fellowship Association\r\nwhich supported two foreign missionaries, a desire in him was awakened\r\nto become a messenger of the Cross in the foreign field.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Mr. Meyer wanted a helper in his mission to the Jews, and Mr.\r\nPolan was invited to take up the work. In this opening he recognised a\r\ncall of God to give his life to testifying for Christ to his Jewish\r\nbrethren. For twelve years he served as a valued helper of Mr. Meyer,\r\nlike a son with a father, busily engaged in district visitation and\r\ntaking part in the services. Personal studies also occupied his\r\nattention, and he found time to his great joy and profit to attend the\r\ncourse of lectures on \"Systematic Theology\" delivered at Queen's Square\r\nby the Rev. Principal Dykes.\r\n\r\nOn the retirement of Mr. Meyer, Mr. Mark Polan succeeded to the headship\r\nof the Mission to the Jews in East London. In 1888 he became an elder in\r\nthe John Knox Church, Stepney.\r\n\r\nPOPER, Rev. Heinrich, D.D., was born at Breidenbach, Germany, in 1813.\r\nHis father died before his birth, and his mother went back to her home\r\nat Hildesheim. There he prepared himself to be a teacher, and began to\r\ngive lessons to Jewish and Christian children at the age of fourteen.\r\nLater he came to the conviction that the Talmud was not in accord with\r\nthe Bible, and after three years inward struggle, he came to England and\r\nwas baptized by Reichardt in 1839. He was for a time in the Operative\r\nJewish Converts' Institution, and then in the Hebrew Missionary College,\r\nand in 1844 he was sent as missionary to Frankfort-on-the-Main, where\r\nhe laboured with great efficiency until his departure in 1870. In 1859\r\nDr. Poper reported that there probably were from five hundred to a\r\nthousand proselytes in the district. (See \"At Home and Abroad,\" by the\r\nRev. W. T. Gidney, 1900.)\r\n\r\nPOSNER, Sigismund August (Löbel), was born in 1804, of wealthy parents\r\nat Auras in Silesia who gave their children a strict orthodox education;\r\nhe was well instructed in the Bible. When studying at Berlin, Mr. Lachs,\r\nDirector of the Deaf and Dumb Institution, sowed in his heart the seed\r\nof the Gospel, which took root and led eventually to his conversion, and\r\nhe was baptized by Pastor Schultze in 1828. His father was at first\r\ngrieved, but became afterward friendly to him. He studied theology and\r\nbecame a very earnest preacher of the Gospel, so that only decided\r\nChristians liked to hear him. He died in 1849. His biography was\r\npublished by Professor Tholuck for Sunday reading.\r\n\r\nRABINOWITZ, Joseph, was born at Resina on the Dniester, September 23,\r\n1837, and died at Kischineff, 1899. He was the son of David ben Ephraim,\r\nand belonged to a rabbinic family. On the early death of his mother, her\r\nfather Nathan Neta took him to be educated at his house. When he was six\r\nyears of age he could repeat the Song of Solomon by heart. He remained\r\nwith his grandfather till 1848, when he went to other relations. At the\r\nage of thirteen they betrothed him. Being compelled by an imperial ukase\r\nto acquire the Russian language, his eyes were opened to a new world of\r\nliterature, and he began to think for himself. In 1855 Jehiel\r\nHershensohn (Lichtenstein), his future brother-in-law, gave him a L.J.S.\r\nNew Testament in Hebrew, declaring at the same time that possibly Jesus\r\nof Nazareth might be the true Messiah, at which news he was very much\r\nsurprised. However, the immediate effect was that he left the Chassidim\r\nand went back to Orgeyev to his grandfather, and studied the Bible more\r\nand Russian law, so that he could act as a solicitor among his people.\r\nIn 1856, he was married, and was then regarded as an influential citizen\r\nof the town, especially when it was seen that he took an active interest\r\nin the education of children and that he contributed important articles\r\nto the Jewish newspapers, and gave lectures at Kischineff, in which he\r\nadvocated the principles of reform and progress. In 1878 he wrote an\r\narticle in the Hebrew paper, \"Haboker Or,\" in which he requested the\r\nRabbis to work for the improvement of the condition of the Russian Jews\r\nby teaching them the necessity of becoming gradually an agricultural\r\npeople, and he showed this by his own example in cultivating his garden\r\nhimself. Not long afterward persecutions broke out in Russia, and he\r\nwent to Palestine on a mission of enquiry with a view of establishing a\r\nJewish colony there. But when he arrived in Jerusalem and became\r\nacquainted with the sad temporal and spiritual condition of the Jews\r\nthere, his heart sank within him, and he was about to leave the Holy\r\nCity in despair, but before doing so he went to the Mount of Olives.\r\nThere he sat down in deep meditation, and reviewing the sad history of\r\nhis unfortunate people, the thought came to him as an inspiration: \"The\r\nkey to the Holy Land is in the hands of our brother Jesus.\" This thought\r\nhe made then the matter and basis of his future work. Returning to\r\nKischineff, he drew up thirteen theses, the substance of which was that\r\nJesus is the only Saviour of Israel as well as of the whole world. With\r\ngreat courage and enthusiasm he then endeavoured by word and pen to\r\npropagate his conviction, and gained in a short time many adherents both\r\nat Kischineff and in other towns of Bessarabia. Having in 1885 published\r\nhis \"Symbol of the Israelites of the New Covenant\" in seven articles,\r\nProfessor F. Delitzsch and the Rev. John Wilkinson encouraged him, and\r\nin Glasgow an association was formed in 1887 for the support of his\r\nmovement. Rabinowitz was baptized in Berlin by Professor Mead, of\r\nAndover U.S.A., in 1885, and henceforth his mission work took a more\r\ndecisive but also perhaps a more restrictive character. He was asked by\r\nProvost Faltin, pastor of the Lutheran Church at Kischineff, to join\r\nthat Church, but for good reasons he declined to do so, as neither he\r\nnor his adherents who had just come out from the synagogue could worship\r\nin a church where there was a crucifix. For still stronger reasons he\r\ncould not join the Russian Church as he was asked to do by the highest\r\nauthorities. Consequently he had to build a hall, in which he preached\r\nthe pure Gospel as long as he lived. The result of this movement was\r\nthat not only Rabinowitz, and his wife and seven children with his\r\nbrother and family, and other individual Jews who heard the Gospel from\r\nhis lips publicly confessed Christ as their Saviour, but also that the\r\nattitude of the Jews in general toward the person of our Lord has since\r\nthen changed for the better.\r\n\r\nRAGSTATT, Friedrich de Weile, was born at Metz in 1648. His father David\r\nwas a teacher in several congregations, and naturally gave him a good\r\nJewish education. At the Jewish school, he learned from the Talmud the\r\nold tradition that the Messiah was to come after 4,000 years had elapsed\r\nsince the Creation. This led him to enquire, and eventually he was\r\ninstructed by Dr. J. Alex. Neuspitzer, pastor of the Reformed Church at\r\nCleves, in 1671. In 1672 he entered the University of Leyden, and in\r\n1677 he became pastor at Assenen; and then in 1680 at Spyk, in South\r\nHolland, where he officiated till he died. Ragstatt was the author of\r\nthe following works:--(1) \"Jefeh Maréh\" (Amsterdam, 1671), written in\r\nLatin, in which he endeavoured to prove, as against the Jewish\r\ncontroversialists, especially Lipman of Mülhausen, the Messianic mission\r\nof Jesus. A Dutch translation of this work, which contains also an\r\naccount of Shabbathai Zebi, was published at Amsterdam, in 1683. (2)\r\n\"Viytmunden--de Liefde Jesu tot de zeelen,\" _ib._ 1678. (3) \"Van het\r\ngnaden Verbond,\" _ib._ 1613. (4) \"Two homilies on Gen. xlix. 10, and\r\nMal. iii.,\" The Hague, 1684. (5) \"Noach's prophetie van Bekeering der\r\nHeyden,\" Amsterdam, 1688. (6) \"An Address delivered on the occasion of\r\nthe baptism of the Portuguese Jew, Abraham Gabai Faro,\" _ib._ 1688. (7)\r\n\"Brostwepen des Geloofs,\" _ib._ 1689. (8) \"Jesus Nazerenus Sions König\r\non Ps. ii. 6,\" Amsterdam, 1688.\r\n\r\nRAPOPORT, the well-known banker in Paris, was baptized with his wife,\r\ntwo sons and four daughters, by Pastor Abric at Passy in 1879.\r\n\r\nRICARDO, David, was born in London 1772, of a Portuguese family, and\r\ndied in 1823, at Gatcomb Park, Gloucestershire. He embraced Christianity\r\nin his youth (see Brockhaus, 12, 523) and was therefore forsaken by his\r\nfather. He entered the Stock Exchange with little means and amassed a\r\nfortune. He was the author of \"Principles of Political Economy and\r\nTaxation,\" 1817. In 1819 Ricardo entered the House of Commons for\r\nPortarlington. Nearly all his brothers became Christians. To his memory\r\nthere is a professorship at the London University by the name of\r\nRicardo.\r\n\r\nRICIO, Peter, son of a Jewish jeweller, was born at Berlin in 1809, and\r\ndied in 1879; he distinguished himself as a Christian in his\r\ninvestigations in physical science. Amongst other works, his \"Lehre von\r\nder Rechnungs elementale,\" became epoch-making and secured for him the\r\nmembership of the academies at Petersburg, Göttingen and Munich, and the\r\ndegree of Doctor from Paris.\r\n\r\nROHOLD, S. B. The story of his conversion is thus told by himself:--\r\n\r\n\"It was in the well-beloved city of Jerusalem that I was born, and there\r\nalso my early days were spent. More than half the inhabitants of\r\nJerusalem are Jews, and mostly very pious, having come from all parts\r\nof the world to be buried in the Holy City when they die. The belief\r\namongst these Jews is that when Messiah comes there will be the\r\nresurrection, and the bodies of those who were buried beyond Jerusalem\r\nwill have to suffer much rolling until they reach the city. Thus to\r\nprevent this they have their burying place in the ancient city, being\r\nzealous for their religion, without enquiring as to whether they are\r\nreally right in doing so. My father's family was very well known,\r\nbelonging to one of the most pious sects of Jews in Jerusalem. It was\r\nthe great delight of my father to speak of his ancestors, who were great\r\nrabbis; and for half a century he occupied an honoured rabbinical\r\nposition himself in Jerusalem (Rosh Hashochatim). My dear mother also,\r\nwhose ancestors were leading Jews amongst the rabbis, was fond of\r\ntelling us wonderful stories of her grandfather, who was a famous\r\ndisciple of the great Geonim of Wilna. Needless to say, both my parents\r\nwere careful to train their children in the religion of their\r\nforefathers. Being the youngest son of the family, I was much petted,\r\nand they did their utmost to bring me up in the fear of God, and in all\r\nthe customs, rites, and rabbinical traditions, whilst they taught me to\r\nlook upon Christianity as idolatry. Truly my parents loved me very much,\r\nand did all in their power to educate me in what they believed to be\r\nright, and their one desire was that I might occupy the seat of my dear\r\nfather, to which all my teachers gave them full hope. Thus the early\r\npart of my life was spent in study within the home circle. It was in\r\nthe year 1893 that I had conversation for the first time with\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\n\"In that beautiful spot, the so-called Garden of Gethsemane, I one\r\nevening met two servants of God, who began speaking to me. At the time\r\nit seemed that I had gone into the Garden merely by accident, but now,\r\nas one looks back over the past, it can be clearly seen that a loving\r\nunseen hand was guiding me. These two Christians explained to me from\r\nthe Scriptures how that Jesus of Nazareth is in very deed the promised\r\nMessiah, Israel's greatest hope. As they reasoned with me, there was one\r\npassage of Scripture which I could not get over, that 'the sceptre shall\r\nnot depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until\r\nShiloh come; and unto Him shall the gathering of the people be.'\r\n\r\n\"With this new light upon the Word of God I was given to understand that\r\nthe promises regarding the coming One told not only of His glory and\r\nmajesty, but also of His suffering and death (Isaiah liii. and Psalm\r\nxxii.).\r\n\r\n\"Slowly I began to see how great and true Jehovah is, and how that His\r\ndivine word regarding the Messiah has been literally fulfilled in Jesus\r\nChrist. I saw my helpless condition, and realized as never before that\r\nmy own righteousness was as filthy rags. And oh, what joy came to me,\r\nwhen the gracious promise of God was fulfilled, a promise which came to\r\nme now with such a new meaning. 'A new heart also will I give you, and a\r\nnew spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart\r\nout of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put\r\nMy spirit within you.' (Ezekiel xxxvi. 26, 27).\r\n\r\n\"Having then accepted Jesus Christ as my own personal Saviour, I began\r\nto wish that my own loved ones might know Him, whom to know is life\r\neternal. But I feared to tell them of my new-found treasure, and it is\r\nimpossible for me to describe the unrest and agony of soul that I passed\r\nthrough in consequence. It was only at the Throne of Grace that comfort\r\ncould be found, and there I sought the strength and help I so much\r\nneeded. After this it seemed very clear that the Lord was speaking to me\r\nthrough His Word, and was thus answering my prayer for guidance. The\r\nword which came to me was that given to Abram of old--'Get thee out of\r\nthy country, and from thy kindred and from thy father's house, unto the\r\nland that I will shew thee.' (Genesis xii. 1).\r\n\r\n\"To leave those who are dear to one, the relations and friends, yes,\r\neven to leave all for Christ's sake, is not easy; yet I knew it would be\r\nbest to do what appeared to be the only right thing. It was a hard\r\ncommand to obey, but still I had the Lord's promises to take with\r\nme,--'Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world' (St.\r\nMatthew xxviii. 20). 'If ye shall ask anything of the Father in My name,\r\nHe will give it you' (St. John xvi. 23). Trusting therefore in God\r\nalone, and persuading myself that He would be faithful in fulfilling His\r\npromises, I started on my journey. And by the help of Almighty God I\r\ncame to England, arriving here as a perfect stranger, not knowing the\r\nlanguage, and without an earthly friend. It was a time of great\r\ntemptation, but the God of my fathers kept me. Letters came from my\r\nfriends and relations in Jerusalem, trying to persuade me to go back,\r\nand my dear father said it would bring down his grey hairs in sorrow to\r\nthe grave if I did not return. Truly I felt the presence of my Redeemer,\r\nand realized that He had called me. This joy filled my heart, and the\r\npeace which passeth understanding was my portion. I praise God for those\r\nChristians who have learned to sympathize with His ancient people. The\r\nLord raised up kind friends who helped me through my difficulties, and\r\ndaily I learned more of my Saviour's love, and found that 'His goodness\r\nfaileth never.' His word says, 'They who put their trust in Him will\r\nnever be put to shame,' and as I trusted, so I proved the truth of it.\r\nAfter spending some time in England, the way opened for me to enter the\r\nBible Training Institute, Glasgow.\r\n\r\n\"Here I had opportunity of studying the Word of God, for which I was\r\nvery thankful. At length a call came for me to enter active service in\r\nthe vineyard of the Lord at the Bonar Memorial Mission to the Jews of\r\nGlasgow. On this work the Lord was pleased to set His seal, sending\r\nfriends to encourage me, and in other ways blessing me abundantly.\"\r\n\r\nROMANN, Nathaniel, was born at Kobylin, Posen, in 1819, and was educated\r\nin the rabbinic schools of Lissa and Breslau, attending also at the\r\nlatter place lectures at the University. From the reformed rabbi, Dr.\r\nGeiger, he learned to reject the Talmud, and from the missionaries\r\nTeichler, Caro, and Cerf, he learned to accept the Gospel, and to become\r\na whole-hearted Christian. He then became a teacher in a Christian\r\nschool at Zieginhals. In 1851 he was accepted by the L.J.S. as a\r\ncandidate for missionary work, and after preparing himself in their\r\ncollege, he was sent to labour in Breslau and Berlin, where he\r\ndischarged his duties faithfully, becoming a blessing to many Jews, till\r\nhis death in Berlin in 1871.\r\n\r\nRONKEL, Philipp Samuel Van, was born at Groningen, Holland, in 1819. His\r\nfather was a teacher in a Jewish school, and when Pauli visited him, he\r\nshewed him a New Testament, which he often read, but concealed it from\r\nhis son. Pauli said to him, \"You may hide the New Testament from your\r\nson, but you cannot thereby frustrate the counsel of God.\" Philipp was\r\nwell educated in rabbinic law, but he found no pleasure therein, nor did\r\nthe services in the synagogue attract him. He was brooding upon\r\nsomething which his parents could not find out. At the age of nineteen\r\nhe entered the academy of Groningen, and studied classics. A professor\r\nthere drew his attention to the influence which Jesus exercises upon\r\nthinking humanity. From that time the personality of the Saviour\r\noccupied his mind, and he began to read with delight the poems of Da\r\nCosta. Just then he was requested by the Jewish congregation at Leerdam\r\nto deliver a sermon at the dedication of a new synagogue, and he took\r\nfor his text Haggai ii. 10, and manifested in his sermon that he was\r\ninclined towards Christianity. It then happened that a Christian pastor\r\nvisited a poor sick woman, but she refused to have his services. Ronkel\r\nthen tried to see what he could do with her, and succeeded in getting an\r\nattentive hearing from her to his stories about good women of the Old\r\nTestament. She then asked him to read the Bible, but he had not one with\r\nhim, and her own Bible she had torn to pieces when the pastor visited\r\nher. Then she asked him to pray, but he had never offered up an\r\nextempore prayer. In this perplexity he thought he could repeat the\r\nLord's prayer in Dutch, which he had learned in Greek. He then repeated\r\nit with such fervour that the woman shed tears. This was the turning\r\npoint in Ronkel's life. He took now the decisive step, and was baptized\r\non Christmas Day, 1856, Da Costa being one of the witnesses. He became a\r\ntrue Christian, according to the testimony of his own father. Later he\r\nbecame one of the most eloquent preachers in Holland, and the Lord\r\nprospered the work which He had committed to his hands.\r\n\r\nROSENBERG, Rev. L., wrote the following brief sketch of himself shortly\r\nbefore he died:--\"My parents were by birth Austrian Jews. By occupation\r\nmy father was a landed proprietor and my mother carried on a drapery\r\nbusiness. There were four children of the marriage, three boys and one\r\ngirl. I was born on April 5th, 1828. My mother and three children died\r\nat a time when I was too young to remember them. My father was baptized\r\ninto the Christian Church. I received a good secular and religious\r\neducation, enough to lead me to avoid bad company; not so much to honour\r\nGod as to honour myself in order to be respected and esteemed so as to\r\nmix with the best society.\r\n\r\n\"Ignorant of and prejudiced against Christianity, how wonderful were the\r\ndealings of the Lord with me will be seen from the following\r\nrecord:--About 1841 I visited Constantinople. Here a young Jewish friend\r\npersuaded me, after much effort, to go with him to a Mission House,\r\nwhere we heard a godly sermon preached before a gathering of young\r\nIsraelites, by the Rev. Dr. Schwartz, who, later on, was Pastor of\r\nTrinity Chapel, Edgware Road, West London, and also a member of the\r\nCommittee of the British Society for the Propagation of the Gospel among\r\nthe Jews. His Scriptural discourse awakened in me a desire to know more\r\nabout Christianity, and I often went to hear him preach at the Chapel of\r\nthe Prussian Embassy on the fore-noons of the Lord's Day.\r\n\r\n\"Having for a few years been convinced of the truth of Christianity, I\r\nstudied the Old and New Testament together, praying morning and evening\r\nfor light.\r\n\r\n\"About 1844 I again visited Constantinople on my way to Asia Minor for\r\nhunting, with a view to becoming a naturalist by profession, collecting\r\nwild animals, birds, and insects of all sorts for the museum. It was\r\nwhilst hunting on the top of Mount Olympus that the glorious scenery and\r\nthe power of God's Word, created as it were, a voice within me, ordering\r\nme to leave all things, and I returned to Constantinople, and was\r\nbaptized by Mr. Allen, son-in-law of Dr. Duncan, the well-known 'rabbi\r\nDuncan' of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\"Again I returned to Broussa, and on my own account I preached the\r\nGospel for a whole year to Jews, Armenians, and Greeks, from among whom\r\nmany, through Divine grace, were converted.\r\n\r\n\"Thus encouraged I went to Malta, where for about six years I studied\r\nliterature and theology in the Protestant College there, and in return I\r\ngave lessons to boys in different classes, four hours a day. To complete\r\nmy preparations for the ministry of the Church I studied both in London\r\nand Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\"The Jewish Committee of the Established Church of Scotland engaged me\r\nfor about seven years, during which time I laboured as one of their\r\nmissionaries at the stations of Salonica and Smyrna, with encouraging\r\nresults, through the Divine blessing resting upon the Jews, Armenians\r\nand Greeks. After this, on my resignation, I returned to Edinburgh and\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\"Whilst in London the Committee of the Malta Protestant College, to whom\r\nI was well known, and amongst whom were the late Lords Shaftesbury,\r\nCalthorpe and Kinnaird, engaged me, and I went to the East to establish\r\nBritish Schools for boys in all the principal towns bordering on the\r\nMediterranean and Black Seas. I established in Cairo a large boarding\r\nand day school, and for over two years I worked on until my health\r\ncompletely broke down, and, acting upon medical advice, I resigned and\r\ncame to London.\r\n\r\n\"On August 21st, 1865, I was engaged by the Committee of the British\r\nSociety, and ever since then I have been labouring, in Adrianople,\r\nchiefly among the Jews, but also among the Armenians and the Greeks.\r\nDuring the first ten years I baptized forty Jews, whilst other enquirers\r\nof mine have been baptized in Constantinople, Smyrna, Jerusalem and\r\nLondon. Many unbaptized Jews, Armenians and Greeks, have also been led\r\nto believe in Jesus as the Saviour of their souls.\" He died in 1905\r\nafter more than forty years missionary work in Adrianople.\r\n\r\nROSENBERG, Samuel, M.D., was baptized at Constantinople about 1873. He\r\naccompanied General Hicks on his compaign in the Soudan, where he lost\r\nhis life with the rest of the expedition.\r\n\r\nROSENBOHM, a Jewish convert in Sweden, was tutor of Hebrew at the\r\nUniversity of Upsala, in 1720. At the Coronation of King Friedrich, he\r\ndelivered a rabbinic oration, and likewise at the conclusion of peace\r\nbetween the Kings of England, Denmark, and Prussia. (Wolff Bib. Heb. 3\r\nN, 2138 a).\r\n\r\nROSENFELD, J. F. (Asriel), was born in 1807. His parents brought him up\r\npiously, and married him at the age of fourteen. Coming in contact in\r\nBerditsheff with a Scotchman, he received from him a New Testament. He\r\nthen went to Warsaw, became an inmate in the House of Industry, and\r\nlearned the trade of bookbinding, was baptized in 1828, and afterwards\r\nlaboured zealously as a missionary in Poland until his death in 1853.\r\n\r\nROSENSTRAUCH, Max, was born at Lemberg, on September 1, 1837. His\r\nparents Moses and Scheindell, were strictly orthodox, and brought him up\r\nin the straitest customs of strict Judaism. As he grew up, they were\r\nproud of his Talmudical knowledge, their intention being that he should\r\nbecome a rabbi. When seventeen years old, family circumstances compelled\r\nhim, however, to go into business, and he was apprenticed to a merchant,\r\nwith whom he remained ten years. In 1865, he accepted the post of a\r\nschoolmaster in Jassy. Whilst there he heard of the Hebrew learning of\r\nthe Rev. W. Mayer, one of the L.J.S. missionaries, and formerly a\r\nscholar in their mission schools in London. From him he received a New\r\nTestament, which he read with eagerness, leading him to take Christian\r\ninstruction for eighteen months. Soon after this a strange event took\r\nplace in his life. He had left Jassy, and was on a steamer going to\r\nOdessa, when the engine broke down. There being danger, the Captain\r\ncalled upon all the passengers to pray. This Max Rosenstrauch felt he\r\ncould not do in the Name of Jesus Christ; all he could say was--\"Lord,\r\nteach us to pray.\" Later on the captain gave an earnest address to the\r\npassengers on St. John iii. 14, 15; this he did not fully understand, but\r\nwhat he did made a lasting impression upon him. In 1867 he was in\r\nKischineff, and of this period he says, \"It only awakens in me painful\r\nreminiscences. My Talmudical supports had been broken by the instruction\r\nreceived at Jassy, and I fell altogether into unbelief. I could perform\r\nneither Jewish nor Christian prayers. I did not even believe in the\r\nexistence of God. I sometimes disputed with the Scotch missionary, Mr.\r\nTomory, and Mr. Daniel Landsmann, and they knew me as a thorough\r\ninfidel Jew. At Odessa I lived as an atheist, and I had no intercourse\r\nwith any Christian. I was busy the whole day at a boarding-school, under\r\nMr. Trübitsch. At Kischineff my slumbering conscience was aroused, and\r\nan unspeakable struggle agitated my heart, until the Lord opened my\r\neyes, and in every page of the Bible I saw the glory of Him who said, 'I\r\nam the Light of the World.' In His Name I was baptized on Easter Day,\r\n1868.\" After some years of missionary work with continental societies,\r\nhe joined the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the\r\nJews, in which he remained till his death, November 3, 1900. The\r\n\"Prayer-book for Jewesses\" and his \"Catechism for Jews,\" which he wrote,\r\nhave been most useful in his work, and in that of the above Society\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nROSENTHAL, Rev. Michael, Vicar of St. Mark's, Whitechapel, who died at\r\nthe age of 63, was a converted Jewish rabbi, who for thirty years\r\ncarried on an earnest missionary work among the Jews of East London. The\r\nstory of his conversion is a remarkable one. Young rabbi Rosenthal, a\r\nHebrew of German extraction, was a profound Talmudist, and as strict and\r\nzealous a Jew as was Saul of Tarsus before the journey to Damascus.\r\nRosenthal was sent on missions in connexion with the faith of his\r\nfathers to Asia Minor, to North Africa and other countries, and finally\r\nto England. On a steamboat he met a very learned and able man, who he\r\nbelieved was a Jesuit. The man was certainly a Roman Catholic, and he\r\npossessed a good deal of rabbinical lore. Rosenthal, as a strict Jew,\r\nobserved all the dietary and other laws of his people, and took his\r\nmeals separately. The supposed Jesuit ridiculed his scruples, and one\r\nday, when the young rabbi was dining alone, touched his bottle of\r\nclaret, thereby, of course, rendering it defiled. Rosenthal was angry,\r\nand the man saw this and taxed him with over-niceness in ceremonial\r\nobservance. \"Do you really think,\" he asked, \"that God is pleased by\r\nyour rejecting things that are good enough for the captain and other\r\npeople on the ship, and that you really serve Him by making yourself so\r\ndifferent from anybody else?\" They had some conversation, which left a\r\ngreat impression on the young rabbi's mind. One argument used by the\r\nsupposed priest had considerable effect. The Jews in the course of their\r\nhistory during the last nineteen hundred years have acknowledged no\r\nfewer than twenty-four Messiahs, all of whom have turned out to be\r\nfalse, either impostors or self-deluded fanatics. Can a nation that has\r\nmade the gigantic mistake of accepting twenty-four false Messiahs claim\r\nto be infallible in rejecting a twenty-fifth? All these false Messiahs\r\nhave appeared and been accepted since our Lord lived on earth except\r\n\"Judas of Galilee,\" who was a contemporary of Jesus Christ. Some time\r\nafter his arrival in England Rosenthal became acquainted with Dr.\r\nWilkinson, then rector of St. Peter's, Eaton Square. The young rabbi was\r\ntremendously impressed by Dr. Wilkinson's great abilities and spiritual\r\nearnestness. \"Here is a Christian,\" he said to himself, \"who is\r\nabsolutely sincere and of great intellectual power. Can Christianity be\r\nmerely a modern form of Paganism when such noble souls as these profess\r\nit?\" He listened to Dr. Wilkinson, and was on the way to conversion when\r\nthe good rector advised him to have recourse to the learned Dr. Ewald, a\r\ncelebrated Jewish missionary of the L.J.S., for the solution of\r\ndifficulties which only a Hebraist could deal with successfully.\r\nRosenthal was eventually baptized by Ewald. He took orders in the\r\nEnglish Church, being ordained deacon by Dr. Jackson, Bishop of London,\r\nin 1877. Four years later he was admitted to the priesthood, and he\r\nserved for thirteen years as curate to the Rev. S. J. Stone, author of\r\n\"The Church's One Foundation,\" at St. Paul's, Haggerston, devoting\r\nhimself chiefly to mission work among the East-end Jews. He organized\r\nthe East London Mission to the Jews, which first came under regular\r\ndiocesan management when the present Bishop of London was Bishop of\r\nStepney. In 1899 Bishop Creighton presented Mr. Rosenthal to St. Mark's,\r\nWhitechapel, a parish which is inhabited almost entirely by Jews. He met\r\nwith a good deal of hostility from the Jews in the first years, but he\r\ntalked straight to them and gradually the opposition died down, and he\r\nsteadily pursued his mission work among them. His labours were attended\r\nwith considerable success. He said that he had himself baptized over six\r\nhundred Jews and Jewesses.\r\n\r\nROSENTHAL, Wildan Charles (Simeon), a learned Jew in Jerusalem, was\r\nbaptized with his wife, son and daughter by Nicolayson in 1839. This\r\nfamily were the firstfruits of the L.J.S. mission in the Holy City. His\r\ndaughter became the wife of Mr. Bergheim, the banker, a Jewish convert.\r\n\r\nROSSVALLY, Dr. Max L., an American Jewish convert in the latter half of\r\nthe nineteenth century. He had been an actor, and after his conversion\r\nbecame well-known as a lecturer in America and in England. He displayed\r\ngreat zeal in his endeavours to form a Hebrew Christian Union, and in\r\n1877 it is recorded that two hundred converts were united together and\r\nheld monthly meetings in New York and in Brooklyn. Rossvally wrote \"The\r\nDying Trumpeter and his Experience,\" a German version of which appeared\r\nin Hamburg, in 1891.\r\n\r\nRUBEN, Maurice, was born in Prussia, in 1856. His people were typical\r\nJews, strict in their customs and in the observance of Jewish laws and\r\ntraditions. He came to the United States when he was sixteen years of\r\nage. In 1895 he had the position of department manager in one of\r\nPittsburg's largest stores. His brother was half owner of this\r\nenterprise. Plans were under way to admit him into a partnership in the\r\nfirm, which would have made him to-day--had he chosen \"the way of the\r\nworld\"--a man of wealth, with an annual income of 15,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nJust prior to this he had married a charming and accomplished Jewess. In\r\nthe matter of religion he had wandered from Judaism to infidelity. Being\r\ndissatisfied with unbelief, he began to \"search the Scriptures\"--both\r\nthe Old and New Testament--which resulted in the opening of his eyes;\r\nhe began to appreciate his own sinfulness, and was thoroughly convicted\r\nof sin, the need of repentance, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. His\r\nconversion took place on March 19th, 1895, and resulted in a most\r\nstriking change of both conduct and thought.\r\n\r\nHe continued to engage in earnest studies and to make it known to his\r\nfriends and acquaintances that he had found Him of whom Moses and the\r\nprophets wrote, even the Messiah. Some months later he felt called upon\r\nto announce his determination to forsake business and become a servant\r\nof the Lord among his own people, believing he was being led by God even\r\nas his forefathers Abraham and Moses.\r\n\r\nAs a result of his decision he was baptized, and set out to illumine the\r\nspiritual darkness of \"his brethren according to the flesh.\"\r\n\r\nThe Jews were very greatly disturbed at this conduct of one of their\r\nprominent young men, and here the trials and troubles of Maurice Ruben\r\nbegan. They made repeated efforts to induce him to forsake his \"change\r\nof life,\" but their efforts were futile. His wife ostensibly left their\r\ncomfortable home with her mother to visit friends in the West.\r\n\r\nOn a Sunday evening in August, subsequent to his conversion, he was\r\nawakened from his slumber by the ringing of the door-bell. Responding\r\nthereto he found himself face to face with two policemen. He was placed\r\nunder arrest and taken to the police station without a warrant of law.\r\n\r\nHe was given no explanation as to the charge which had been preferred\r\nagainst him, and neither on Sunday nor Monday did a magistrate appear to\r\ngive him a hearing. He was, however, visited twice by two physicians,\r\nwho conversed with him in a mysterious manner. They introduced\r\nthemselves as insanity experts. Two days and two nights in a felon's\r\ncell, with worse than a criminal's treatment, was a most trying\r\ncircumstance. Yet God was there to minister strength unto him. (St. Luke\r\nx. 19.) He was visited on the second day by his wealthy brother, who\r\nkindly informed him that he had been crazed by religion and was to be\r\nsent for treatment to a sanatorium. He was taken that evening by\r\nofficers of the law to an asylum for the insane.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few days he was pronounced by the superintendent of\r\nthe institution to be a perfectly sane man, but he was unable to release\r\nhim. His Christian friends endeavoured to intercede for him, but without\r\navail, and consequently this tried child of God was called upon to\r\nendure the humiliation of five weeks' confinement in a mad-house, and\r\ngiven the same treatment accorded to hundreds of demented folk in the\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nHe was visited several times by his wealthy brother who offered him his\r\nliberty if he would leave Pittsburg and go West, but he took a firm\r\nstand and gladly refused to do anything except to remain in the city and\r\npreach the Gospel of the Son of God to his brethren. A man of\r\nconsiderable business interests in the city, Mr. J. B. Corey, finally\r\nheard of him through the daily papers, and was led to call upon him in\r\ncompany with a number of the officials of the institution. Mr. Corey and\r\nthe gentlemen found Mr. Ruben in his little room reading the Bible. A\r\nshort conversation satisfied the visitors that steps must be taken to\r\nobtain the freedom of this man. Mr. Corey then instituted _habeas\r\ncorpus_ proceedings before the late Judge White.\r\n\r\nAt the close the judge frankly informed the wealthy brother and the\r\ninsanity experts that they and all connected with this outrageous infamy\r\nought to be sent to prison, and that the alleged demented man was saner\r\nthan those who had pronounced him insane.\r\n\r\nMr. Ruben at once began to prepare himself for his missionary work, and\r\nsometime later opened up headquarters in Congress Street--the centre of\r\nthe Jewish Ghetto--and suffered much persecution. For the first few\r\nyears he was interfered with and maligned in every way imaginable. His\r\nstreet meetings were frequently broken up, and he was hooted and stoned\r\nby the Jewish element. \"All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall\r\nsuffer persecution.\" God, however, led him safely through all his\r\ndifficulties and trials, and enabled him to found the New Covenant\r\nMission, Pittsburg, Pa.[21]\r\n\r\n\r\n[21] \"The People, the Land and the Book,\" New York, January, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUBINO, Dr. Joseph Karl Friedrich, was born at Wetzlar in 1799. He\r\nbecame professor at Marberg in 1831. His intercourse with earnest\r\nChristians at Cassel, and especially with a converted Jewess, known in\r\nGermany as Mother Jolberg, led him to investigate the question at issue\r\nbetween Judaism and Christianity for himself, and being convinced of the\r\ntruth of the latter, he made a public confession of it by baptism at\r\nCassel in 1842, and lived a consistent life. On the evening before his\r\ndeath he said to friends, \"No other foundation can any man lay than that\r\nis laid, even Jesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\nRUNHOLD, Karl Wilhelm (Zacharia Lehman), Ph.D., was born at Hamburg in\r\n1777. His father was a silk merchant there. At the age of twenty-two he\r\nbecame an evangelical Christian, graduated at Rostok in 1812, and\r\ndistinguished himself afterwards as a writer. He edited the\r\n\"Gemein-nützigen Unterhaltungs blätter,\" the \"Allgemeine Theater\r\nZeitung,\" and the \"Archive für Theater und Literatur\" in Hamburg. He\r\ndied in 1841.\r\n\r\nSACHS, Marcus, was born of wealthy parents in 1812, at Inowrallan in\r\nPosen. His father sent him to an uncle to study at the Gymnasium and\r\nafterwards at the University there. During his studies he lost his faith\r\nin Judaism and became a follower of Voltaire. In 1842 he went to\r\nEdinburgh and became acquainted with the professor of theology, Dr. John\r\nBrown, who made an effort to win him for Christianity, and gave him to\r\nread the well-known book of Abbot Guenée \"Lettres de quelques Juifs\r\nPortugais, Allemands et Polonais à M. Voltaire.\" After he returned it\r\nDr. Brown asked him whether he would like to read a book which defended\r\nthe Christian religion? and on his affirmative reply he gave him\r\nLimbroch's \"Amica Collatio cum erudito Judæo.\" These two books removed\r\nhis prejudices, and he then began to read the New Testament, and after\r\nmonths of enquiry, deliberation and prayer he decided to accept\r\nChristianity by faith, and was baptized by Dr. Brown, April 5th, 1843.\r\nHe then studied under Dr. Chalmers, and was licensed to preach, and\r\nbecame tutor of Hebrew in the Seminary of the Free Church at Aberdeen.\r\nHe is described as a most humble and loving Christian man by Dr. Saphir\r\nand others who knew him. He died there on September 29th, 1869, passing\r\naway with the leaves of autumn, a ripe sheaf into the garner of God.\r\n\r\nSALKINSON, Isaac Edward, was born at Wilna, and died at Vienna, June\r\n5th, 1883. According to some, his father's name was Solomon Salkind. As\r\na youth he set out for America with the intention of entering a\r\nrabbinical seminary there; but whilst in London he was met by agents of\r\nthe L.J.S., from whom he heard the Gospel and was converted and\r\nbaptized. His first appointment as a missionary to the Jews was at\r\nEdinburgh, where he became a student in the Divinity Hall. He was\r\nordained a minister of the Presbyterian Church at Glasgow, in 1859. He\r\nwas then a missionary of the British Society in various towns, including\r\nPressburg, and finally settled in Vienna (1876). Salkinson translated\r\n\"Philosophy of the Plan of Salvation\" under the title \"Sod ha-Jeshu'ah\"\r\n(Altona, 1858); \"Milton's Paradise Lost,\" under the title \"Wa Yegaresh\r\net haadam\" (Vienna, 1871); Shakespeare's \"Othello\" and \"Romeo and\r\nJuliet,\" under the titles \"Itiel ha kushi\" (_ib._, 1874; preface by P.\r\nSmolensky); and \"Ram we-Yael\" (_ib._, 1878); Tiedge's \"Urania,\" under\r\nthe title \"Ben Koheleth\" (_ib._, 1876, revised); and the New Testament\r\nunder the title \"Haberith Hahadasha.\" The last mentioned translation was\r\nundertaken for the British Society in 1887; it was published\r\nposthumously under the supervision of Dr. C. D. Ginsburg at Vienna in\r\n1886.\r\n\r\nSALVADOR, Yonkheer Moses, flourished at Amsterdam in the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century. One of his ancestors built the Salvador house near\r\nthe Bank of England. It is said that the Salvadors were direct\r\ndescendants of the Maccabees, the Saviours of Israel, hence the name\r\nSalvador, meaning Saviour. Moses Salvador was intimately acquainted with\r\nPauli and welcomed him to his house, where they discussed the subject of\r\nChristianity. The result was that he joined the French Reformed Church,\r\nat Haarlem in 1852. For a long time after his conversion he used to give\r\nThursday evening lectures on Christianity, which were attended by\r\nChristians and Jews.\r\n\r\nSAMANY, a native of Assesso in Abyssinia, was one of Flad's early\r\nconverts there. He had to undergo bitter reproaches from his mother and\r\nrelations on account of his becoming a Christian, but his reply to his\r\nmother was that he loved her now better than before, and that he would\r\ntake care of her. Working on his weaver's stool he at the same time used\r\nto speak to his two sisters of the \"pearl of great price\" that he had\r\nfound, and they too became Christians. During the imprisonment of the\r\nmissionaries, he attached himself to Waldemayer, who was free. After\r\nthe arrival of the English expedition he went to the coast, where he and\r\nhis companion Petrus were met by the Jewish traveller Halevy, who gave\r\nthem some money and promised to take them to Paris. Not perceiving at\r\nonce his intention, they accepted the money, but they brought it back to\r\nhim the next morning, and as he refused to take it back, they threw it\r\ninto the sea, although they suffered hunger at the time. Then they went\r\nto Magdala, and afterwards with Flad to Europe, and were placed in the\r\ntraining school at St. Chrischona, near Basle. But as Samany could not\r\nstand the climate there, Flad took him to his own house at Kornthal, and\r\nwas then obliged to send him back to Abyssinia. On his return he and\r\nAgashe preached the Gospel earnestly to the Falashas. Samany continued\r\nto do so even from his sick bed. Conscious that the time of his\r\ndeparture had come, he asked that the coffin which he had before\r\nprepared for himself should be placed before him, then saying, \"Father,\r\ninto Thy hands I commend my spirit,\" he entered into rest.\r\n\r\nSAMSON, Lewis Paul, was an English Jew by birth, the son of a Dutch\r\n\"sopher\" (writer of scrolls of the law and of phylacteries). When a boy\r\nhe used to hear Dr. McNeile at St. Jude's, Liverpool, and in other ways\r\ncame in contact with Christian influences. When he became forty years\r\nold he was asked by his children to hear them repeat a portion of\r\nScripture which they had been taught at school. It happened to be Isaiah\r\nliii., and it proved to be the turning point in his life. Like many\r\nanother Jew, he could not believe at first that it was a part of the Old\r\nTestament, but it led eventually to his baptism by a Hebrew Christian,\r\nwho was one of the Society's missionaries.\r\n\r\nHis public profession of Christianity made him an object of abhorrence\r\nto his brothers and sisters, though later on they learned to respect him\r\nfor his simple, unswerving faith, and some of them, it is believed,\r\nbecame Christians. He continued his occupation, but at the same time was\r\nan active worker in St. Jude's parish, until his appointment under the\r\nSociety. He was a man of one book and that book the Bible, which he knew\r\nalmost by heart. Many a Jew was struck by his intimate knowledge of the\r\nWord of God, and none ever doubted his being a true believer, however\r\nmuch they disliked his invariably holding up Christ before them. Many of\r\nthe poor Jews, both converted and unconverted, missed him, after his\r\ndeath, as a friend in need, who often used to minister to their\r\nnecessities out of his scanty earnings. At one time, he was known to\r\nhave lived for weeks on sixpence a day, to save up the money which he\r\nhad borrowed and advanced to a Jew who either could not, or would not,\r\nrepay. No wonder that so many Christians learned to love and respect him\r\nas \"an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.\"\r\n\r\nSAPHIR, Rev. Adolph, D.D. We learn from him the story of his conversion\r\nin one short sentence: \"I, at that time, a lad in my twelfth year, was\r\nthe first of our family to accept the Gospel.\" Mr. Wingate, who gives\r\nan account of the event, says that the Jews testified to Adolph's being\r\nborn again from on high. \"We heard that the Jews were saying that the\r\nHoly Ghost had fallen on Saphir's son, and that he expounded the\r\nScripture as they had never heard it before.\" In the autumn of 1843,\r\nAdolph went to Dr. Duncan in Edinburgh, that he might perfect his\r\nknowledge of English, where he remained six months, and then went to\r\nBerlin, and studied at the Gymnasium from 1844 to 1848, acquiring a\r\nthorough knowledge not only of German literature, but also of German\r\nphilosophy. In 1848-49, he was tutor in the family of Mr. William Brown\r\nin Aberdeen. In 1854, after finishing his theological studies, he was\r\nordained to the Presbyterian ministry, and licensed as a preacher in\r\nBelfast. He then laboured as a missionary to the Jews in Hamburg for one\r\nyear. Then he had the charge of a church in South Shields, and in 1861\r\nhe received a call to Greenwich, where people from various churches\r\nflocked to hear him. In 1872 a church was purchased for him at Notting\r\nHill, where his ministry was always attended by all sorts of earnest\r\nChristians, especially his Thursday morning lectures. This was also the\r\ncase wherever he went to preach. Saphir's love and devotion to his\r\npeople and to the cause of missions was boundless. He died April 4,\r\n1891, a few days after his wife. His last sermon was on the text, \"And\r\nEnoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.\" The following\r\nare some of Saphir's works: (1) \"Who is a Jew?\"; (2) \"Who is an\r\nApostate?\"; (3) \"Expository Lectures on the Epistle to the Hebrews\";\r\n(4) \"The Hidden Life\"; (5) \"Our Life Day\"; (6) \"Found by the Good\r\nShepherd\"; (7) \"Life of Faith\"; (8) \"The Compassion of Jesus\"; (9) \"The\r\nEverlasting Nation\"; (10) \"Christian Perfection\"; (11) \"The Unity of the\r\nScriptures\"; (12) \"Christ and the Scriptures\"; (13) \"The Lord's Prayer\";\r\n(14) \"Israel's Present and Future\"; and (15) \"All Israel shall be\r\nSaved.\"\r\n\r\nSAPHIR, Israel, brother of the famous satirist at Vienna, was living in\r\nPesth in the first half of the nineteenth century, where, owing to his\r\nerudition and character, he exercised great influence upon the Jewish\r\ncommunity, and was regarded by them as another Gamaliel. Coming in\r\ncontact with the Scotch missionaries, Dr. Duncan, Mr. Wingate, Mr. Smith\r\nand Dr. Schwartz, he heard the Gospel from them, and when convinced of\r\nits truth he did not hesitate to embrace it. This is described by his\r\nson in a few words: \"Through the instrumentality of the Scotch\r\nmissionaries my father saw the truth as it is in Jesus, and was received\r\ninto the Christian Church in 1843 at the age of sixty-three years.\"\r\n\r\nSAPHIR, Philipp, an elder brother of Adolph, was rather inclined to\r\nworldliness, but became serious when there was an inundation in Pesth,\r\nand he had tried to save life. In 1842 Rev. Dr. Schwartz passed through\r\nPesth on his way to Constantinople, and Philipp heard his addresses to\r\nJews, and was impressed, becoming conscious of sin and the need of\r\npardon. He was baptized in the Calvinistic Church of Pesth, in 1843, by\r\nSuperintendent Paul Török. He wrote afterwards to Mr. Schwartz: \"I was\r\nadmitted into the Church of Christ. I cannot describe my feelings to\r\nyou. Ah! the infinite love of God! He has given me much peace, nothing\r\nwill deprive me of it. I am happy, joyful; my soul is with God. I praise\r\nChrist every hour.\" He then, being nineteen years of age, went to\r\nCarlsruhe to be trained as a teacher, and on his return to Pesth in\r\n1845, at once set to work and organized a Y.M.C.A. Becoming ill, he\r\ntaught poor Christian and Jewish children gratis from his sick bed \"The\r\nEvangelical doctrine as he found it in the Word of God.\" He died\r\nSeptember 27, 1849, whilst his father knelt by his side with two friends\r\nengaged in prayer. The daughters of Israel Saphir all became devoted\r\nChristians. One was married to Rev. Dr. Schwartz, and the other to Rev.\r\nC. A. Schönberger, both well known in the Christian Church.\r\n\r\nSAUL, Aaron, was baptized by the L.J.S. missionaries in 1812. Lewis Way\r\ntook him to his Seminary. He however did not become at once a\r\nmissionary, but engaged in business and held the office of Clerk in\r\nPalestine Place Chapel, and taught in the Sunday School for twenty-seven\r\nyears. He devoted himself especially to the care of enquirers and to the\r\ncirculation of the \"Old Paths\" and other missionary literature among the\r\nJews in London. From 1841 to 1843, he laboured as missionary at\r\nBrussels, and died in London, Jews following his funeral.\r\n\r\nSARGON, Michael, was born of Jewish parents at Cochin in 1795, and died\r\nabout 1855. He was converted in 1818, through the preaching of J.\r\nJarrett of Madras, and became the first missionary of the L.J.S. to the\r\nJews in India. In 1820 Sargon visited his parents at Cochin, who\r\nreceived him kindly, and for a time the Jews there seemed to have no\r\nobjection to discussing with him his new faith. A local committee was\r\nfound in Madras with Sargon as the representative missionary. Madras\r\nbecame the centre of the Society's work in India. In 1822 Sargon had 116\r\nJewish children under his charge at Cochin, but in 1824 he was\r\ntransferred to Bombay, where he opened, under the auspices of the\r\nL.J.S., a school exclusively for Jews. In Cochin Sargon baptized a Jew\r\nand two Jewesses in 1828. He and his brother Abraham continued their\r\neducational activity for nearly thirty-nine years after the Society had\r\nceased to give a grant to the Bombay mission. (Report of L.J.S., 1821.)\r\n\r\nSCHAPIRO, B. A. M. One summer morning in the year 1890 there visited the\r\nreading room of the Hebrew Christian Mission, 17, St. Mark's Place, New\r\nYork, a Hebrew lad of nineteen years, with bright eyes and curly black\r\nhair. He had just arrived there from Germany, although he was a native\r\nof Poland. The boy's keen, intelligent countenance attracted the\r\nattention of the Rev. Jacob Freshman, Superintendent of the mission, and\r\nas several Jewish men were having a lesson in English, that gentleman\r\nsuggested that the young Jew should become a member of the class. The\r\nstranger knew no English, the teacher had no knowledge of Polish or\r\nRussian, consequently their conversation was carried on mainly by\r\npantomime, and with the help of one of the scholars, who acted as\r\ninterpreter. Jews are naturally fine students, grasping knowledge with\r\navidity. The new arrival proved no exception to the rule, and so before\r\nthe forenoon ended he had learned the English names of the articles of\r\nfurniture in the room, the days of the week, the numerals from one to\r\nten, and also how to write his name, \"Benjamin Aaron Moses Alexander\r\nSchapiro\", in English script. Long after, when he had learned to speak\r\nEnglish with ease, we asked: \"Why did your parents burden you with such\r\na number of names?\" \"Because,\" was his answer, \"they hoped and wished\r\nthat I might combine in my character, when I came to manhood, the\r\nqualities of patriarch, priest, prophet and king.\" He was a fine Hebrew\r\nscholar, and carefully followed in a Hebrew Bible the Psalms which the\r\nother pupils read in English. We found at our next visit the new pupil\r\nawaiting our coming. His countenance glowed with pleasure, as he\r\ncordially grasped our hand and proceeded to dispose of our satchel and\r\numbrella. That morning he read several pages in an English primer. When\r\nwe went again we found that Benjamin had taken his departure, though\r\nurged by the superintendent and his kind wife, for they both had become\r\ngreatly interested in him, to make their house his home for an unlimited\r\nperiod. His proud, ambitious spirit chafed at the thought of becoming a\r\nburden on the hands of strangers, so he started out to earn his own\r\nliving, an entirely new experience in his case. Hitherto he had never\r\nbeen called upon to solve the three vital problems: \"What to eat,\"\r\n\"What to drink,\" \"Wherewithal to be clothed.\" His brief stay at the\r\nmission proved, however, a very important epoch in this young life. The\r\nseeds of Gospel truth were sown in his heart, and afterwards quickened\r\nby the Holy Spirit, sprang up, budded, blossomed, and ultimately bore\r\nthe fruitage of earnest work for the Master. Two years had elapsed since\r\nour first meeting. One evening, at the close of the service in a Hebrew\r\nChristian Church, we were cordially greeted by a young man. The native\r\ndress had been changed for American, the hair arranged in a different\r\nstyle, etc. So great was the transformation that at the first glance we\r\nfailed to recognize our quondam pupil and friend. He then told us what\r\nhad befallen him since we last met. He had, soon after leaving the\r\nmission, found employment with Mr. Benjamin Clayton, a butcher at\r\nJamaica, L. I. Imagine, if you can, what a trial it must have been to\r\none brought up to a strict observance of the tenets of orthodox Judaism\r\nto have to handle \"Gentile\" meat, especially the abhorred pork. A\r\nChristian man who dealt at the shop became interested in the young\r\nstranger, seeing him to be the possessor of talents which ought to be\r\nimproved and developed. This kind friend placed him under Christian\r\ntutors.\r\n\r\nEventually Mr. Schapiro was converted, and publicly confessed Christ,\r\nand united with a church in Brooklyn. Soon after taking this important\r\nand decisive step he was convinced that it was his bounden duty and\r\nglorious privilege to tell the story of a Redeemer's love to his own\r\npeople. Very visionary seemed the project. How could he, a youth who had\r\nnot yet attained his majority, a stranger, a foreigner, a \"despised\"\r\nJew, without means, with few friends, accomplish this mighty\r\nundertaking? Faith laughs at impossibilities. Enthusiasm is ever\r\ncontagious. A few friends became interested, amongst others Mr. Horatio\r\nS. Stewart, the gentleman who had previously provided him with a\r\nscholarship at Pennington Seminary. The first Jewish mission work in\r\nBrooklyn was inaugurated in that part of the Twenty-sixth Ward known\r\ncommonly as \"Brownsville.\" Here a colony of Polish and Russian Jews had\r\ntaken up their abode. A small hall was hired and services held on\r\nSaturday afternoon. Great was the excitement, tremendous the opposition.\r\nJews gathered in crowds, anxious to hear what the youth might have to\r\nsay concerning his apostasy from the faith of his fathers. Men thrice\r\nhis age plied him with questions regarding Christianity, quibbles\r\nmostly; occasionally, perhaps, an enquirer might have been moved with a\r\ngenuine desire to know the truth. The young missionary, however, was\r\nenabled to possess his soul in patience, and with quiet dignity to repel\r\ntheir attacks. The following incidents will serve as representative\r\nspecimens of these interruptions: Once, when the missionary was giving a\r\nbrief exposition of the first chapter of St. John's Gospel--\"In the\r\nbeginning was the Word,\" etc., \"'Logos' as 'word' here is in the Greek\r\nsynonymous with 'Memrah' in the Rabbinical writings,\" he remarked. A Jew\r\nsprang to his feet in a second. \"You cunning Mr. Missionary!\" he\r\nshouted--\"trying to prove your statements from the Talmud, which you\r\nprofess to disbelieve, because you cannot prove them from the Old\r\nTestament!\" Quick as a flash came the rejoinder: \"David, in the\r\nthirty-third Psalm, sixth verse, says: 'By the \"word\" of the Lord were\r\nthe heavens established.'\" The assailant was effectually silenced, but\r\nso angry was he at having been outwitted in public by one so much\r\nyounger than himself that whenever he chanced to see the missionary\r\napproaching he would quickly cross to the other side of the street.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion a Jew said: \"You know perfectly well how wrong and\r\nwicked it is for a man to desert the religion of his fathers. Why, even\r\nthe Gentiles despise those who are guilty of such an act!\" \"What do you\r\nmean by the religion of our fathers?\" was asked in return. \"Why, of\r\ncourse, I mean the religion of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,\" the Jew\r\nanswered. \"But Abraham departed from the faith of his fathers. This\r\n'apostasy' was imputed unto him for righteousness. You reproach me\r\nbecause I have departed from the religion of my fathers, which you claim\r\nto be the 'true religion.' Listen for a moment to the witness borne by\r\nMoses and the prophets concerning the religion of our fathers. Moses,\r\nour great lawgiver, says: 'Understand, therefore, that the Lord thy God\r\ngiveth thee not the good land to possess for thy righteousness; for thou\r\nart a stiffnecked people.' 'You have been rebellious against the Lord\r\nfrom the day that I knew you.' Isaiah the evangelist, says of our\r\nfathers: 'From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no\r\nsoundness in it, but wounds and bruises, and putrifying sores.' 'Ah!\r\nsinful nation!' and mark the expression: 'A seed of evil-doers, children\r\nthat are corrupters.' In another place the same prophet says: 'Woe is\r\nme, for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in\r\nthe midst of a people of unclean lips.' Jeremiah says: 'Can the\r\nEthiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may ye also do\r\ngood that are accustomed to do evil.' The weeping prophet declares: 'All\r\nthese nations are uncircumcised, and the house of Israel is\r\nuncircumcised.' Jehovah himself says to Ezekiel: 'Son of man, I send\r\nthee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath\r\nrebelled against me; they and their fathers have transgressed against me\r\nto this very day. For they are impudent children and hard-hearted.' The\r\nsuffering prophet again says: 'Thou art not sent to a people of a\r\nstrange speech, and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel; not\r\nto many people of a strange speech, and of an hard language, whose words\r\nthou canst not understand; surely had I sent thee to them, they would\r\nhave hearkened unto thee. But the house of Israel will not hearken unto\r\nthee; for they will not hearken unto Me, for all the house of Israel are\r\nimpudent and hard-hearted.' Jesus the great teacher, said: 'Ye are of\r\nyour father, the devil.' Now, in view of all these assertions, can you\r\nstill insist upon my still adhering to the 'religion of my fathers.'\r\nYou say: 'The Gentiles despise those who have departed from the religion\r\nof their ancestors.' That statement can be easily disproved from\r\nhistory. Jesus, Paul and the other founders of the Christian Church all\r\napostasized from the faith of their fathers. Luther, a Roman Catholic,\r\nbecame the leader of the Reformation. Neander, Edersheim, Saphir and a\r\nhost of other converted Jews have been indeed 'the glory of Israel, and\r\nlights to lighten the Gentiles.'\"\r\n\r\nThese Saturday services were continued for more than two years. An\r\nevening school, where Jewish people, employed during the day, could\r\nreceive gratuitous instruction in English, was carried on with a great\r\ndegree of success. A protracted strike among the tailors, cloak-makers\r\nand operators on men's clothing, the principal industries of this\r\nsettlement, reduced the people to the direst poverty; hundreds were on\r\nthe verge of starvation. In this, the time of their need, Mr. Schapiro,\r\nat his own expense, opened a soup-kitchen in his rooms, himself serving\r\nthe tables, and for more than two weeks scores were fed. That no offence\r\nmight be given to their prejudices, the meat was \"Kosher,\" that is,\r\nbought at a Jewish butcher's, and prepared by a Jewish cook. This kind,\r\nthoughtful treatment did much to disarm their repugnance against him as\r\na Christian. The missionary also opened a similar mission in the\r\nSixteenth Ward, Eastern District, where there is a Jewish population of\r\n50,000, and for nearly a year carried on the two stations, holding a\r\nservice at Brownsville on Saturday morning, and a second one in the new\r\nmission in the afternoon. Finally his committee deemed it best to\r\nconfine his labours entirely to the Eastern District station, as they\r\nconsidered it the more hopeful field, on account of the large number of\r\nJews in the vicinity. Meanwhile a denominational mission had been\r\nestablished in Brownsville. The Brooklyn Christian Mission to the Jews\r\nhas from the outset been interdenominational. This work in the Eastern\r\nDistrict was not inaugurated without opposition. The missionary and the\r\nmen who assisted him in the distribution of the notices for the services\r\nand tracts were targets for the stones of crowds of Jewish boys. The\r\nolder people greeted them with sneers, derision, offensive epithets, and\r\nsometimes with curses. Among the Jewish boys, Samuel ----, acted as\r\nleader and instigator in the attacks. After a while he ventured into the\r\nmission, intending to create a disturbance, and, if possible, break up\r\nthe services, but the story of a Saviour's love fell upon his ears, and\r\nas has many times happened in the history of missions, he who \"came to\r\nmock remained to pray.\" Samuel was convinced, converted, and for two\r\nyears has been a consistent member of a church in this city.\r\n\r\nAfter seven years of mission work, owing to the combined labour of\r\ncarrying on the service and collecting funds for the maintenance of the\r\nmission, his health broke down and he gave up the work.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1900, Mr. Schapiro published the first number of \"The People,\r\nthe Land and the Book.\" He had a theory that much of the variance\r\nexisting between Jews and Christians had its foundation in mutual\r\nignorance and misapprehension of their different religious beliefs. He\r\ndesigned to reach both parties in a spirit of love.\r\n\r\nMr. Schapiro for eleven years had no home, no intercourse with his own\r\nfamily. Having become an \"apostate,\" he was worse than dead to them. All\r\nhis overtures for reconciliation were scornfully rejected. To be cut off\r\nfrom all one's relatives, to have no home life, is ever a great\r\naffliction, particularly to a Jew, for the Jewish attachment and\r\ndevotion to home and family are proverbial. A Jew who has embraced\r\nChristianity can sing in all sincerity, \"Jesus, I my cross have taken,\r\nall to leave and follow Thee,\" for it is his veritable experience.\r\n\r\nOne day he chanced to meet a fellow-townsman, who, to his great\r\nsurprise, told Mr. Schapiro of the latter's cousin, who lived in New\r\nYork. Of course he lost no time in hunting up this relative. At first he\r\nwas greeted with sharp, bitter reproach, for his change of faith, but\r\nwhen it was manifest that his love for Christ had not obliterated, but\r\nrather intensified, his love of kindred, speedy reconciliation followed.\r\nMr. Schapiro learned that his father had lost his property, and also\r\nthat his eldest son had died. Letters were exchanged, and complete\r\nreconciliation ensued.\r\n\r\nThe painful situation of the Jews in Russia made Mr. Schapiro anxious on\r\nhis family's behalf. Through the assistance of kind friends he was\r\nenabled to bring over two of his sisters. They reached there one\r\nThursday, and a week later found employment. There were still eight\r\nremaining at home, father, mother, brothers and sisters. Through the\r\nefforts of the once deemed lost brother \"Joseph\" they were enabled to\r\ngo, and are now comfortably situated in their own home in New York.\r\n\r\nMr. Schapiro's life is not lacking in romance. Some years ago, while he\r\nwas conducting the mission in Boerum Street, a pretty Jewish girl of\r\nthirteen, whose parents lived opposite, frequently attended the\r\nservices. After a while the family moved and Mr. Schapiro lost sight of\r\nhis little friend. After he had left the mission, and was conducting the\r\nmagazine, they chanced to meet again. Their renewed acquaintance ripened\r\ninto love, and a year after they were married. Mrs. Schapiro is a\r\ncharming little woman, bright and attractive. Their union has been\r\nblessed with a darling little daughter, Beatrice Sylvia, now nineteen\r\nmonths old. The former homeless wanderer rejoices in a pleasant,\r\ntastefully arranged home, and a wife who delights to minister to his\r\ncomfort, and is hospitable in the extreme, always welcoming his friends,\r\nand leaving nothing undone which can minister to their comfort.\r\n\r\nThis paper has already far exceeded the limits originally intended;\r\nstill it seems impossible to close it without some slight character\r\ndelineations. Mr. Schapiro, so the Jews who come from his native place\r\ntell us, is of a good family; his father was a man of wealth and\r\nposition, and was noted for his rigid adherence to the tenets of\r\northodox Judaism. One can easily understand how sore a trial it must\r\nhave been for such a Jewish father to have his son embrace Christianity,\r\nand what in his opinion was still more disgraceful, to have that son\r\nbecome a missionary of the Cross among his own people. Mr. Schapiro is\r\nintensely fond of books, is a good student, ambitious to be thoroughly\r\neducated, and is already quite a forcible speaker. Fearlessness forms\r\none of the strong points of his character. He is positive, liberal,\r\nwithout being a radical, conservative, yet not bigoted. He has what is\r\nan absolute requisite to all who undertake leadership of any kind--good\r\nexecutive ability. Naturally sensitive, as a missionary among the Jews\r\nhe has had many a fiery ordeal to pass through and many hard reproofs to\r\nbear. But to his credit, be it said, he has been enabled to retain his\r\npatience and to exhibit a forgiving disposition. He had a very correct\r\nidea of the propriety and reverence with which all religious services\r\nshould be conducted. Never using cant expressions, and although gifted\r\nwith a keen sense of the humorous, he never stooped to ridiculous\r\nillustrations, which, though they create laughter, leave no lasting\r\nimpression for good. He has never sought notoriety. Mr. Schapiro is\r\nstill a young man, and like all young people, has much to learn, but if\r\nhealth and strength are granted, he bids fair to become an able advocate\r\nof the Messiah among his own brethren after the flesh, the Jews.[22]\r\n\r\n\r\n[22] \"The People, the Land and the Book,\" Miss Mary C. Sherburne. July,\r\n1905.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHERESCHEWSKY, Dr. Samuel Isaac Joseph, from 1877 to 1883 missionary\r\nbishop of the American Church in China. He was born at Tanroggen, in\r\nRussian Lithuania, in the year 1831, and brought up in the religion and\r\nlearning of the Jews, graduating from the University of Breslau. The\r\nreading of the New Testament in a Hebrew translation, which had fallen\r\ninto his hands, convinced him of the truth of Christianity. This must\r\nhave been the Society's version, as at that time Professor Delitzsch's\r\nand Salkinson's versions were not in existence; and, therefore, the\r\nSociety was the first agent in the Bishop's conversion. Soon after his\r\nconfession of Christ he went to the United States. He acquired his\r\nknowledge of Greek in the Theological Seminary at New York, which he\r\nentered in 1857. The Christians with whom he first came into contact\r\nbelonged to the Baptist and the Presbyterian denominations; he was\r\nbaptized by a minister of the former, and studied theology in a seminary\r\nof the latter body. But before he had finished his studies, he had\r\nlearned and acknowledged the position of the Episcopal Church, and was\r\nadmitted a candidate for holy orders under the Bishop of Maryland. In\r\n1859 he was ordained deacon in St. George's Church, New York, and in the\r\nfollowing year was advanced to the priesthood in China, whither he had\r\naccompanied the elder Bishop Boon on his return from a home visit.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1861, Schereschewsky made a translation of the Psalms\r\ninto the colloquial. This was his first work. In 1863 he moved to Pekin\r\nand began, with Bishop Burdon of Hong Kong, the translation of the\r\nfirst Mandarin Prayer Book. The main part of this book, viz., Morning\r\nand Evening Prayer, the Collects, and the Psalter, were his work; Bishop\r\nBurdon taking the remainder of the Book. This was completed in 1864. In\r\n1865 a committee of five leading Chinese scholars, Dr. Edkins, Dr.\r\nMartin, Dr. Blodgett, Bishop Burdon and himself, undertook the\r\ntranslation of the New Testament into Mandarin. This is still in use\r\ngenerally throughout the Empire. The only other Mandarin version in\r\nexistence at that time was Dr. Medhurst's \"Mandarin,\" which was based on\r\nthe so-called \"Delegates' Version\" in Wen-li. The Bishop began the\r\ntranslation of the Old Testament himself into Mandarin, in the autumn of\r\n1865, and finished this colossal undertaking at the end of eight years.\r\nThis, with the Mandarin Testament mentioned above, forms the ordinary\r\nChinese Bible in general use by Christians in China, and is read at\r\nevery service from the lecterns in the China Mission of the American\r\nEpiscopal Church, as mentioned in the organ of the Domestic and Foreign\r\nMissionary Society of the American Church.\r\n\r\nIn 1875, Dr. Channing Moore Williams, the American Bishop for China and\r\nJapan, having been assigned to the work in Japan alone, Dr.\r\nSchereschewsky was elected Bishop of Shanghai. With great modesty and\r\nself-distrust he declined the office; but being again chosen in 1877, he\r\nwas persuaded that it was his duty to undertake its labours and\r\nresponsibility. He returned as Bishop to Shanghai in the autumn of\r\n1878, and, in the course of the year 1879, translated the whole Prayer\r\nBook into Wen-li, or classic style, blending with it as much as possible\r\nthe English and American Prayer Books, with the hope that all missions\r\nof the Anglican communion might use it in China. Although this hope was\r\nnot gratified, the book was for many years the only one in use in all\r\nthe American missions, and formed the basis of the colloquial versions\r\nwhich have since superseded it. In 1879 the Bishop went up the river to\r\nWuchang, and began the translation of the Apocrypha. He had only\r\ncompleted one book when he was smitten down during the intense heat of\r\nthe summer of 1881, and his physicians ordered his removal to Europe,\r\nwhither he went the following spring. He was under treatment from 1882\r\nto 1886, at Geneva in Switzerland. In 1883 Bishop Schereschewsky,\r\nunwilling to retain an office whose duties he could not discharge,\r\nresigned his Bishopric.\r\n\r\nWith wonderful perseverance he now devoted all his energies of mind,\r\nwhich remained unimpaired, to the work of bringing the Scriptures within\r\nthe reach of the Chinese nation. Fully acquainted with their language in\r\nits different forms, and being not only a skilful Sinologist, but one of\r\nthe most learned Orientalists in the world--and that by the testimony of\r\nProfessor Max Müller--using a pen as long as he could hold a pen, and\r\nthen, owing to paralysis, working on a typewriter with the two fingers\r\nwhich he could control, he translated the Old Testament from the\r\noriginal Hebrew into the Mandarin dialect, leaving to a secretary only\r\nthe reduction of the typewritten words into the Chinese character. For\r\ntwenty years, day after day, in China, and for a while in Massachusetts,\r\nand more recently in Japan, when he was near a printing-press which he\r\ncould use, he worked under disadvantages which would have put an end to\r\nthe courage and the labours of almost any other man. Not long before his\r\ndeath he completed his greatest work, the translation of the whole\r\nBible, including the Apocrypha, into the Wen-li dialect. He also wrote\r\nChinese grammars and dictionaries, and translated the Gospels into\r\nMongolian, preparing also a dictionary of that language. He died at\r\nTokyo, on October 15th, 1906.\r\n\r\nWe may add the following extract from the Bible Society's memoir of the\r\nBishop, written by the Rev. Crayden Edmunds, M.A.:\r\n\r\n\"His early training, whereby he came to know Hebrew better than any\r\nother language, specially fitted him to become a translator of the Old\r\nTestament. This peculiar fitness was soon recognised by his missionary\r\ncolleagues, who about 1865 entrusted him with the translation of the Old\r\nTestament into Northern Mandarin. He also worked on the Peking Committee\r\nas a translator of the New Testament. His version of the Old Testament,\r\nfirst published by the American Bible Society in 1875, has since been\r\nrepeatedly issued by both the A.B.S. and the B.F.B.S. A revised edition\r\nappeared in 1899. But a still greater work was his translation of the\r\nwhole Bible into Easy Wenli; he added the New Testament in this case,\r\nin order to secure uniformity; both Burdon and Blodgett's, and Griffith\r\nJohn's versions of the New Testament being in a somewhat different\r\nstyle. This Bible the A.B.S. published in 1902.\r\n\r\n\"The significance of Bishop Schereschewsky's achievements, however, lies\r\nnot so much in their extent and scholarship as in their testimony to the\r\nindomitable courage of the man and his devotion to his work. Six years\r\nafter his consecration as Bishop he became paralysed, and had to resign\r\nhis episcopal jurisdiction. His malady increased till it left him with\r\nthe use of only the middle finger of each hand. Fortunately his\r\nintellect remained unimpaired, and with these two fingers he was able to\r\ntype out his MSS., which were afterwards rewritten in Chinese characters\r\nby his secretary.\r\n\r\n\"But the toil was well worth while. To this man alone has it been\r\ngranted to give to the two hundred and fifty million Mandarin-speaking\r\nChinese, as well as to the mass of readers in China, the Oracles of God\r\nas found in the Old Testament. Reviewing, therefore, his life in the\r\nlight of these facts, we may surely trace the divine purpose in taking\r\nhim from one task, for which a successor would without difficulty be\r\nfound, and setting him free for another, for which his whole previous\r\nlife had been a unique preparation. As a translator his influence has\r\nbeen far wider than it could have been as a Bishop, and Chinese\r\nChristians will ever remember, with gratitude to God, the great scholar\r\nwho out of weakness was made strong--who laid so well and so truly the\r\nfoundations of the Bible in their greatest vernacular, and in the more\r\npopular form of their written language.\"\r\n\r\nSCHLOCHOW, Rev. Emmanuel, was born at Wingiz in Silesia. His father\r\nbeing indifferent to religion, he had no religious education, and became\r\nonly aware that he was a Jew when his fellow-Christian scholars\r\nmockingly reminded him of it at school. This he could not endure, and\r\nhis father advised him to go to a Roman Catholic priest and be baptized.\r\nHowever, he was then a thorough infidel, and at one time, on account of\r\nsome disappointment that he had met with, he bought a pistol and was\r\nabout to commit suicide, when the Scotch missionary Cerf knocked at the\r\ndoor of his room, and not only rescued him from taking away his life,\r\nbut by God's help enabled him to devote that life to His service. He was\r\nconverted and baptized in 1848. In 1851 he became connected with the\r\nL.J.S., and was sent as a missionary in 1853 to Jassy, where he remained\r\nthree years. In 1856 he was appointed to Alsace, and had his station at\r\nStrassburg, whence he itinerated to France and the Rhine provinces, and\r\nmet everywhere acceptance among Jews and Christians. In 1874 he went\r\nwith the Rev. A. Bernstein on visits to several rabbis in Alsace and\r\nLorraine, when they were cordially received and had profitable\r\nconversations. He then was transferred to Crefeld, but much suffering\r\nfrom asthma obliged him to retire to Worthing, where he died in 1876,\r\nand upon his tombstone in the churchyard there can be read the words in\r\nHebrew, \"I know that my Redeemer liveth,\" so that he still preaches to\r\nJewish visitors.\r\n\r\nSCHÖNBERGER, Rev. C. A., after embracing Christianity, studied at Pesth\r\nand Basle and Leipzig, laboured for some time as a Scotch Free Church\r\nmissionary at Pesth, where many Jews attended his lectures. He was\r\nordained in Stuttgart in 1867, laboured then at Prague till 1872, when\r\nhe entered the service of the British Society, and was sent back to\r\nPrague, and from there he was transferred to Vienna, where he was very\r\nefficient and realized the fulness of blessing upon his ministry. Some\r\nof his converts became preachers of the Gospel among Jews and\r\nChristians. About 1892 he returned to England, and on account of illness\r\nresigned his office. After the death of his brother-in-law, Dr. Saphir,\r\nhe felt that he was called to supply in some measure his influence on\r\nbehalf of the Jews, and he connected himself with the work carried on by\r\nRabbi Lichtenstein at Pesth, and joining the Rev. David Baron, they both\r\nfounded a mission in East London, under the name of the \"Hebrew\r\nChristian Testimony to Israel,\" where a great work has been going on\r\never since in their own mission-house in Whitechapel Road, whence the\r\nGospel has been carried by word and literature to Hungary, the Danubian\r\nPrincipalities, and Russia.\r\n\r\nSCIALITTI, Rabbi Moses, an Italian Jew, was baptized on Trinity Sunday,\r\n1663 by Dr. Warmestre, Dean of Worcester, at the Church of St. Margaret,\r\nwhen the Bishop of Chester, Dr. Samuel Collins, the Countess Lucy of\r\nHuntingdon, and other persons of high standing were sponsors by proxy.\r\nScialitti subsequently addressed a letter in Italian and English to the\r\nJews, stating the grounds for his embracing Christianity, and exhorting\r\nthem to go and do likewise.\r\n\r\nSCHUFFAMER, Rabbi Elisha, came from Salonica to Jerusalem, and was\r\nthrough the preaching of Dr. Ewald converted to Christianity and\r\nbaptized in 1848. He then returned to Salonica to fetch his family, but\r\nfour of his children had died, yet his wife followed him to Jerusalem.\r\nThere he was employed for a time as layreader, and was afterwards\r\ntransferred to Cairo, where he had a Bible depôt.\r\n\r\nSCHULHOF, Dr. M., a Jewish convert, was a medical missionary of the\r\nBritish Society. In 1854 he published: \"Notes on Diseases in Turkey in\r\nreference to European troops and Memoir of the remittant fever of the\r\nLevant.\"\r\n\r\nSCHWARTZ, Rev. Dr. Karl (Solomon), was born at Meseritz in Posen in\r\n1817. His father, Isaac Schwartz was a merchant, and gave him a strict\r\nrabbinic education, cherishing the hope that he would one day become a\r\nteacher in Israel. To this end he was sent to Berlin in 1832 to study at\r\nthe rabbinic Seminary there. In the lectures the professors occasionally\r\ncompared Judaism with Christianity, to the disadvantage, of course, of\r\nthe latter. This excited in Schwartz a desire to examine Christianity\r\nfor himself, so he took the first step by exchanging the Seminary for\r\nthe Gymnasium. During the course of his studies he was instructed in\r\nChristianity and baptized October 18, 1837. He then studied theology for\r\na year at Halle, under Tholuck, and then under Neander, Hengstenberg,\r\nand Twesten, for four years at Berlin. At that time he used to give\r\nlessons in foreign languages to the inmates of the Berlin House for\r\nforeign missions, when his landlady said to him once, \"It is all very\r\nnice for you to teach these young men foreign languages in order that\r\nthey may be qualified to preach the Gospel to the heathen. Have you at\r\nall thought of your own brethren who live in your own neighbourhood\r\nwithout the light of the Gospel?\" This was a word in season. Thereupon\r\nhe entered into correspondence with the L.J.S., joined the Church of\r\nEngland, and was ordained deacon by the Bishop of London on March 20,\r\n1842, and was sent by the Society to Constantinople. On his way there he\r\nsojourned for awhile at Pesth, where his lectures on Isaiah liii. bore\r\ngood fruit, and it seems that he then got engaged to Maria Dorothea, a\r\ndaughter of Israel Saphir. He did not remain very long in\r\nConstantinople, because his connexion with the Scotch Mission at Pesth\r\ncaused him to join the Free Church of Scotland, and he was sent by that\r\nChurch to Berlin, where he was stationed from 1844 to 1849, and he went\r\nthen to Prague, but settled in the same year at Amsterdam. There he\r\nfound that the Dutch Jews were not so accessible as the Jews in Hungary,\r\nTurkey, and Germany, so he adopted the method of preaching special\r\nsermons in churches and inviting the Jews through advertisements to\r\nattend them. In 1850 he issued a Dutch paper, giving expositions of\r\nMessianic prophecy and the like, for circulation among the Jews. This he\r\nedited for several years. In 1856 a mission church was built for him,\r\nand his first sermon then was on Zech. iv. 6. In that church he baptized\r\nquite a number of Jews. On Sunday, August 1, 1858, Schwartz ascended the\r\npulpit to preach to a congregation of 1,200, on St. John xii. 26, and\r\nwhile bowing down to offer up prayer, a young Jew quietly crept up the\r\nsteps and stabbed him with a dagger in the left shoulder so that he was\r\nsaturated with blood, and had to be carried home in a fainting\r\ncondition. The attempted assassin was put into prison, where Schwartz,\r\nafter his recovery, visited him but did not succeed in bringing him to a\r\nbetter mind. However, a near relation of his became a Christian after\r\nthat event; and a Jewess, too, was thereby induced to come to Schwartz\r\nfor instruction and baptism. After fifteen years' arduous labours in\r\nHolland, Schwartz accepted a call in 1864 from the congregation of\r\nTrinity Chapel, Newnham Street, London, to succeed Ridley Herschell. In\r\nLondon he founded a home for enquirers; and edited a periodical\r\nentitled, \"The Scattered Nation.\" In 1866 he founded \"The Hebrew\r\nChristian Alliance,\" and delivered lectures, besides preaching twice\r\nevery Sunday. In this good work he continued till August 24, 1870, when\r\nhe died on his knees at the age of fifty-three, and was buried near his\r\nfriend, Ridley Herschell.\r\n\r\nSCHWARZENBERG, Rabbi Abraham, lived in the little town of Kasimir in\r\nPoland, and was employed by a Jewish merchant who at last became a\r\nbankrupt, yet on account of his Talmudic learning was chosen as rabbi at\r\nLublin. Schwarzenberg, who was an upright, conscientious man, knowing\r\nthat his master had deceived many poor people, took offence thereat, and\r\nreproached the Jews for not acting according to the law in this matter.\r\nAfter this some one gave him a New Testament which missionaries had left\r\nin the town. After reading it he persuaded others also to read it, and\r\nexposed himself to persecution. He then went in search of the\r\nmissionaries, and coming to a Roman Catholic priest he expressed a wish\r\nto be instructed and baptized, but the priest told him that he must\r\nfirst of all lay aside the New Testament. Schwarzenberg concluded that\r\nhe was not a missionary, and went to Lublin, where he had heard there\r\nwas an Evangelical minister. This worthy man looked upon him with\r\nsuspicion and received him coldly, so he went to a river and dipped\r\nhimself three times in the name of the Holy Trinity. At last he heard\r\nthat the missionaries resided in Warsaw, so he tramped at once to\r\nWarsaw, where Dr. McCaul instructed and baptized him in 1828, in his\r\n65th year. In spite of his age Schwarzenberg began to learn German in\r\norder that he might intelligently take part in the services of the\r\nChurch of England. His mode of life was quite that of a Polish Jew, with\r\nlong fore-locks and dressed in a long kaftan with girdle. He used to say\r\nthat a converted Jew must have a changed heart, but not a change of\r\ndress. He maintained himself by selling fruit in the street, and also\r\nworked voluntarily as a missionary. The police had an order to protect\r\nhim against the Jews, though when he was in a lonely street he was often\r\nstoned by them. In this manner he ran the Christian race until 1842,\r\nwhen he departed at the age of eighty to be with Christ.\r\n\r\nSEGALL, Rev. Joseph F., a native of Piatra (Moldavia), came with a\r\nnumber of young friends into possession of missionary literature which a\r\ncolporteur from Bucharest had left in the town in 1874. This they\r\nstudied secretly in rotation. After being solemnly impressed by the\r\ntruth, they wrote a letter to the Rev. F. G. Kleinhenn, asking for\r\nadmission to some institution in which they might learn more of the\r\nGospel. Mr. Kleinhenn replied that he had no such home, and could not\r\nencourage anyone to come to him except on his own means and on his own\r\nresponsibility. However, one day Segall and his friend Suffrin appeared\r\nat Mr. Kleinhenn's house, and he had to take them in. They were then\r\ninstructed by Mr. Kleinhenn and Mr. Bernstein for some considerable\r\ntime, and then baptized. The history of the two runs to some extent\r\ntogether. The relations of each tried their utmost to win them back to\r\nJudaism, but they had grace given to them not to yield. In the same year\r\nMr. Bernstein, then stationed at Strasburg, was the medium of their\r\nbeing admitted by Dr. Heman, at Basel, into his home for proselytes, to\r\nbe trained for future usefulness. After finishing their course of study\r\nthey applied to the L.J.S., passed through its missionary college, and\r\nwere appointed missionaries. Segall was stationed at Birmingham, and\r\nordained by the Bishop of Worcester in 1877-8 to the curacy of St.\r\nMartin. Subsequently he was appointed to the charge of the mission at\r\nDamascus, where he also acted as chaplain to the English colony there.\r\n\r\nSIMON, Erasmus, was one of the earliest converts of the L.J.S. This\r\nexcellent man seems to have been a native of Holland. In London he made\r\nthe acquaintance of J. Frey, and heard the Gospel from him and was\r\nbaptized. In 1820 he was appointed to work under the Rev. A. S. Thelwall\r\nat Amsterdam. In 1829 he formed a society called the \"Friends of the\r\nHebrew Nation,\" under the patronage of the Bishop of London. This\r\nsociety rented three houses in Camden Town for Jewish enquirers, and\r\nstarted the \"Operative Jewish Converts' Institution.\" Amongst its\r\ninmates were the future founder of the British Society for the\r\nPropagation of the Gospel among the Jews, Ridley Herschell, and\r\nWertheimer, the future well-known bookseller. The former was one of\r\ntwelve candidates for baptism presented by Simon to Bishop Blomfield,\r\nwho baptized them in St. James', Piccadilly.\r\n\r\nSIMSON, Martin Eduard, son of a banker, German jurist and statesman,\r\nborn Nov. 10, 1810, at Königsberg, and died at Berlin, May 22, 1899. He\r\nembraced Christianity as a young man, studied law, and in 1833 he became\r\nprofessor of Roman law, and three years later a judge. In 1848 he\r\nreceived the title of \"Rath\" in the higher court. In 1848 he was sent\r\nas a deputy from Königsberg to the National Congress at Frankfurt, and\r\nwas soon raised to be its president, and had the honour to offer the\r\ncrown of the German Empire to King Frederick William IV. of Prussia.\r\nSubsequently he held high offices of state, and in 1879 he was appointed\r\nfirst president of the German Supreme Court at Leipzig; in 1888 he\r\nreceived the decoration of the Black Eagle of Prussia and was ennobled.\r\nIn 1892 he retired to private life. He was the author of \"Geschichte des\r\nKönigsberger Ober Tribunals.\" Of his three baptized brothers, one became\r\nprofessor of Oriental languages at Königsberg, and the other two lawyers\r\nat Berlin.\r\n\r\nSKOLKOWSKI, J., was a native of Calwary in Russian Poland, baptized at\r\nKönigsberg, and then studied at the L.J.S. Missionary Training College\r\nin London. In 1849 he laboured as a missionary in London, Cairo, Lublin,\r\nGnesen, and Posen, and then, in 1869, at Königsberg. \"His annual\r\nreports,\" says the Rev. W. T. Gidney, \"supplied most interesting details\r\nof mission service, together with glimpses of the social condition,\r\npursuits, and religious opinions of Jews, among whom he devotedly\r\ncarried on the work of preaching Christ and Him crucified, until his\r\nretirement in the beginning of 1888, after a long service of very nearly\r\nforty years.\"\r\n\r\nSOBERNHEIM, Dr. Joseph Friedrich, an earnest convert in Berlin in the\r\nmiddle of the nineteenth century. The history of his conversion is as\r\nfollows. A student had pawned a New Testament with a Jew for a paltry\r\nsum of money, and when he came to redeem it, the pawnbroker, having in\r\nthe meantime read it and become a Christian, gave the student a hundred\r\nLouis d'or as a token of gratitude because he had through this book come\r\nto a saving knowledge of Christ. This Jewish convert was instrumental in\r\nthe conversion of nine other Jews, among whom was Dr. Sobernheim and his\r\nfather. He was esteemed as an author of medical works. He wrote:\r\n\"Handbuch der Praktischen Arzenimittelehre\" (Berlin, 1844), \"Beiträge\r\nzur Phänomenologie des Lebens,\" _ib._, 1841. He died in 1846. (\"Jewish\r\nIntelligence,\" December, 1864.)\r\n\r\nSOLOMON, Rev. Benjamin Nehemiah, was born at Lemberg in 1791, and in due\r\ntime became a rabbi. In 1814 he came to London, and through the\r\ninstrumentality of J. Frey became a Christian, and was ordained in 1817.\r\nHe then accompanied Lewis Way on his missionary journey through Holland,\r\nGermany and Russia, both preaching the Gospel to the Jews everywhere.\r\nLewis Way having obtained for him permission from the Emperor Alexander\r\nto work in Poland, he first of all translated the New Testament into\r\nYiddish, for the use of Polish Jews. In 1821 he accompanied McCaul to\r\nWarsaw, but from Amsterdam he wrote to Thelwall that the condition of\r\nhis wife and children in Galicia obliged him to return home. His own\r\nfather declared to the missionary Smith, in 1827, that he was living as\r\na Christian.\r\n\r\nSTAHL, Friedrich Julius, son of a banker, jurist and publicist, was born\r\nat Munich, January 16, 1802, and died at Bruckenau, Aug. 10, 1861. He\r\nbecame a Christian in his eighteenth year, and was baptized at Erlangen\r\nin 1819. Already at the age of fourteen he discussed religious topics\r\nwith his fellow scholars. The writings of Thiersch had a great influence\r\nupon him. After he had become a Christian, he acted as a missionary to\r\nhis own family and brought his parents and brothers and sisters to the\r\nSaviour. He studied law at the Universities of Wurzburg, Erlangen, and\r\nHeidelberg. In 1834 he represented the University of Erlangen in the\r\nBavarian Parliament. In 1840 he became professor of law at the\r\nUniversity of Berlin, where his lectures drew an audience of all\r\nclasses. His idea of Christianity was that it should pervade the whole\r\nlife and also the State. According to Lord Acton, Stahl had a more\r\npredominant influence and shewed more political ability than Lord\r\nBeaconsfield (Acton, Letters to Mary Gladstone, p. 103, London, 1904).\r\nHis writings are as follows, \"Die Philosophie des Rechts nach\r\nGeschichtlicher Ansicht,\" 2 vols. (Heidelberg, 1830-37); \"Ueber die\r\nKirchenzucht\" (1845-58); \"Das Monarchische Princip\" (Heidelberg, 1845);\r\n\"Der Christliche Staat\" (_ib._, 1847-8); \"Die Revolution und die\r\nConstitutionelle Monarchie\" (1848-9); \"Was ist Revolution?\" (_ib._,\r\n1852), of which three editions were issued; \"Der Protestantismus als\r\nPolitisches Princip\" (_ib._, 1853-4); \"Die Katholische Widerlegungen\"\r\n(_ib._, 1854); \"Wider Bunsen\" (1856); \"Die Lutherische Kirche und die\r\nUnion\" (1859-60). After his death were published, \"Siebenzehn\r\nParlamentarishen Reden\" (1862), and \"Die Gegenwärtigen Partien in Staat\r\nund Kirche\" (1868).\r\n\r\nSTEINHARDT, son of the landlord for many years of the L.J.S. schools at\r\nBucharest naturally came in contact with the mission there, but no one\r\nof the family shewed any inclination towards Christianity, yet the seed\r\nsown in the son's heart bore fruit in time. He went to Constantinople\r\nand was baptized there. Then he became a city missionary in New York,\r\nstudied theology, and became, in 1871, pastor of a Swiss congregation in\r\nFountain City, Wisconsin, and in 1882 at Louisville, Ky.\r\n\r\nSTERN, Dr. Henry A., was born of Jewish parents on April 11, 1820, at\r\nUnterreichenbach, in the Duchy of Hesse Cassel. Subsequently the family\r\nremoved to Frankfort-on-the-Main, where they resided in the quaint old\r\n\"Judengasse,\" now a thing of the past. Though educated in this town with\r\na view to the medical profession, Stern, when about seventeen years of\r\nage, decided to follow commerce, and to that end repaired to Hamburg. It\r\nwas there, in the providence of God, that his attention was first drawn\r\nto Christianity, by noticing some Christian literature in a glass case\r\nnear the house of the London Jews' Society's missionary, Mr. J. C.\r\nMoritz. The impression subsequently obtained by its perusal was\r\nincreased when, on arrival in London, in 1839, Stern was induced by a\r\nfellow-lodger to attend a Sunday afternoon Hebrew service in Palestine\r\nPlace, conducted by Dr. Alexander McCaul. Thoroughly awakened, Stern\r\nsought the missionary the next day, and, indeed, for many days, until he\r\nbecame a recognized enquirer, and was eventually admitted into the\r\nOperative Jewish Converts' Institution. There he was further carefully\r\nprepared in Christianity, and baptized on March 15, 1840. For two years\r\nlonger he remained in the Institution, working at his trade, but it was\r\nvery evident that Stern, by his learning and gifts, was eminently fitted\r\nto be a missionary, and consequently he was taken into the Society's\r\nCollege for a further term of two years.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Stern received his first missionary post, and was sent to\r\nBagdad. He left London under the direction of the Rev. Murray Vickers,\r\naccompanied by three other young missionaries. They broke their journey\r\nat Jerusalem, where Stern was ordained deacon by Bishop Alexander, on\r\nJuly 14 of the same year. Arriving at Bagdad, Stern threw himself into\r\nhis work with great zeal and ardour.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish population of Bagdad then consisted of about 16,000 souls.\r\nThe whole trade of the town was in their hands, and they were supposed\r\nto be the most wealthy class of the community. They manifested the\r\ngreatest anxiety to obtain the books published by the Society. Day after\r\nday the house of the missionaries was filled to overflowing with Jews of\r\nall ages, ranks and stations, and the streets near were crowded all day\r\nby numbers of Jews, Stern being constantly stopped as he walked along\r\nthem. The bazaars, khans, and the Beth Hamedrash, were visited, and\r\nsupplied frequent opportunities for proclaiming the Gospel.\r\n\r\nThe eagerness manifested by the Jews of Bagdad to enter into discussion\r\non the subject of Christianity, and more especially the application of\r\ntwo enquirers for regular instruction, stirred up active opposition on\r\nthe part of the rabbis, and an excommunication was issued against all\r\nwho should have intercourse with the missionaries. This had the desired\r\neffect. For six or seven months no Jew was seen in the mission house.\r\nThen, gradually, some ventured to come by stealth; and, soon, from\r\ntwelve to twenty again visited the missionaries on Saturdays, several of\r\nwhom were of the most respectable Jewish families in Bagdad. The Jewish\r\nauthorities, however, did not relax their vigilance, but threatened to\r\nrepeat the anathema.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1844 Stern made a journey to certain places on the\r\nbanks of the Euphrates, going to Hillah, where he visited the synagogue\r\nand Jewish schools; the tomb of Ezekiel, greatly venerated by the Jews;\r\nMeshed-Ali, a Moslem town with a few Jews; Cufa; the tower of Belus\r\n(Babel) or Birs Nimroud; and the ruins of Babylon. In 1845 Stern and a\r\nfellow-labourer, the Rev. P. H. Sternchuss, improved the time during\r\nwhich missionary operations in Bagdad were suspended, in consequence of\r\nthe _cherem_ mentioned above, in making a missionary journey into the\r\ninterior of Persia. They held much interesting intercourse with the Jews\r\nof Kermanshah and Hamadan. On November 21 of the same year, the two\r\nmissionaries embarked on the Tigris for the purpose of undertaking a\r\nsecond journey in Persia. They visited Bussorah, Bushire, Shiraz, and\r\nseveral other places where Jews resided. Both in synagogues and Jewish\r\nschools, and also at their lodgings, they proclaimed the unsearchable\r\nriches of Christ to considerable numbers of their Jewish brethren.\r\n\r\nThe deadly scourge of cholera prevailed in Bagdad to an alarming extent\r\nin 1846, and in a very few weeks several thousands were suddenly taken\r\noff by it, and missionary work was consequently suspended. The Jews\r\nthought the visitation was owing to the fact that many of their brethren\r\nhad imbibed the doctrines of Christianity, and their opposition became\r\nmost violent. A second _cherem_ was pronounced in the synagogues against\r\nthe missionaries and all holding intercourse with them.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the violence of the rabbis and the ignorance which\r\nprevailed, especially amongst Jewesses, the missionaries met with many\r\nto whom they were able to declare the love of the Redeemer, and several\r\nreceived regular instruction. Of the Bagdad Jews in general they\r\nsaid:--\"A spirit of enquiry pervades all classes of Jews in Bagdad The\r\nrabbis are fully sensible of it, and endeavour to do everything in their\r\npower to check this extraordinary movement.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1847 a temporary retreat to Persia was thought advisable, during\r\nwhich Stern preached the Gospel to many hundreds of Jews, both in\r\nChaldæa and Persia, and extensively circulated the Scriptures in the\r\nHebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Armenian languages. This\r\nwas a great achievement in a region hitherto noted for intolerance,\r\nbigotry, poverty, fanaticism, and superstition.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival from home of fresh supplies of books, the lodgings of the\r\nmissionaries were crowded for days together, from morning till evening,\r\nwith eager applicants for the sacred treasure. The missionaries were now\r\nwell known to many of the Jews in the surrounding countries, from the\r\njourneys which they undertook from time to time. They sent the Word of\r\nGod to the wilds of Kurdistan, the deserts of Khorasan and Turkistan.\r\nThey were privileged to admit two Israelites, one of Bagdad and the\r\nother from Bushire, into the Church of Christ by baptism. Others\r\nreceived instruction from them for a longer or a shorter period.\r\n\r\nOn their return to Bagdad, a room belonging to the mission was fitted up\r\nfor Divine Service, and usually from twelve to fifteen Jews attended the\r\ndaily morning service, at dawn of day; the instruction of enquirers\r\ntaking place immediately afterwards. An English service was held on\r\nSunday morning, and a Hebrew service in the afternoon during winter. An\r\noperative converts' institution was opened.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1850, a Jewish doctor was baptized, which incident produced\r\nanother severe anathema from the rabbis against all who should have any\r\nintercourse with the missionaries. \"In order to make the interdict more\r\nimpressive,\" wrote Stern, \"the horn was blown, and all the books of the\r\nlaw unrolled.\" This was repeated several days. Jews, in large numbers,\r\nhowever, began to call at the depôt which Stern opened; and he affirmed\r\nthat there were many who had learned the Truth from reading the New\r\nTestament. In 1851 and 1853 two other baptisms were recorded. After\r\neight or nine years spent in Mesopotamia, where Mrs. Stern's health had\r\ngreatly suffered from an attack of cholera, Stern was transferred to\r\nConstantinople in 1853.\r\n\r\nThere he found a larger and even more important sphere of work--totally\r\ndifferent, as he had now to deal with Spanish instead of Eastern Jews.\r\nThey were down-trodden and oppressed, and their pitiable state was not\r\nimproved by the extensive conflagrations, which periodically devastated\r\ntheir quarter. Numbers, however, became enquirers, notwithstanding\r\nsevere persecution, and some were baptized. The mission schools were\r\nwell attended, and the medical mission, conducted by Dr. Leitner, did\r\nexcellent service. Stern visited Adrianople, Salonica, and other towns\r\nwith large Jewish populations.\r\n\r\nThe year 1856 was signalized by a visit to the Karaites and other Jews\r\nin the Crimea. At Baktchi-Serai, Stern was surrounded by Jews, \"all\r\nanxious to buy Gospels,\" and was the guest of the chief rabbi, who\r\nshewed him the cemetery of the Karaites--strangely called \"The Valley of\r\nJehoshaphat\"--with its 40,000 sculptured tombs, and in which myriads more\r\nhad been interred, to whose memory poverty or indifference had raised no\r\nmonument. At Simpheropol, Stern preached in the synagogue and sold a\r\nnumber of New Testaments and Pentateuchs. On one occasion he had the\r\nprivilege of addressing British troops in their quarters in the Crimea.\r\n\r\nStern made a second journey in the same year--to Arabia.\r\n\r\nThe space at our command is totally inadequate to describe the incidents\r\nof that romantic and perilous journey, in the wake of Joseph Wolff who,\r\njust forty years before, had engaged in the same pioneer work. Stern had\r\nto take precautions for his safety, adopting native dress and passing as\r\nthe \"Dervish Abdallah.\" At Safon, a beautiful mountain town, the report\r\nthat a man who spoke Hebrew, and yet was no Jew, dressed like a\r\nMohammedan and yet ignored the Koran, caused much sensation amongst the\r\nJews, who flocked to see him, and to whom he preached in a synagogue.\r\nThis was repeated at other places. At Sanaa he was occupied for twelve\r\ndays, with very little rest at night, preaching to the multitudes who\r\ncongregated wherever he went. The last day of his visit there he\r\ncharacterized as \"the happiest of my life, the happiest of my missionary\r\ncareer.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a visit to England in 1857, Stern returned to Constantinople,\r\ntaking up again the threads of his settled missionary work there.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 Stern embarked on the first of his most memorable journeys to\r\nAbyssinia. Mr. J. M. Flad had been working in that country as one of the\r\n\"Pilgrim Missionaries\" from St. Chrischona. More Christian labourers,\r\nhowever, were needed; and so Stern was despatched from Constantinople to\r\nfound an English mission, if possible, amongst the Falashas--some\r\nthousands of Jews dwelling in the highlands of the interior. Flad now\r\njoined Stern, and the two worked hand-in-hand together. The results of\r\nthis preliminary visit were thus summed up by Stern, who, having\r\naccomplished his purpose, repaired to England in 1861:--\"I visited, in\r\ncompany with Mr. Flad, the Bishop of Jerusalem's Scripture Reader,\r\nupwards of thirty Falasha settlements, and saw the priests, and all\r\nthose that could read, from more than fifty-five other places. The\r\ndesire to obtain the Word of God exceeds all description; young and old,\r\nthe man standing on the verge of the grave, and the youth just rushing\r\ninto life's happiest whirl, heedless and indifferent to the pain and\r\ndifficulties of the road, followed us for days and days, till we yielded\r\nto their unwearied entreaties, and from our scanty stock supplied their\r\ncommunities with copies of the sacred volume.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking in Exeter Hall in May of the next year, Stern said, \"During my\r\nstay in that country, I was amazed at the excitement created by our\r\npreaching through the various provinces we visited. Frequently, hundreds\r\nof Christians and Jews would meet together near our tent with the Word\r\nof God in their hands, converse and investigate those truths which we\r\nhad been preaching.\"\r\n\r\nFlad and a fellow-labourer named Bronkhörst, who had joined him,\r\ncontinued to carry on the work with much success, and on July 21, 1861,\r\nthe first fruits of the mission were gathered in, twenty-two Falashas\r\nreceiving Holy Baptism. On August 4, nineteen more were baptized. This\r\nencouraging success led to Stern going out again to Abyssinia in\r\nSeptember, 1862, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Henry Rosenthal. We cannot\r\nfollow the details of the work for the next two years, but must sum them\r\nup in Stern's own words:--\"We have in the course of two years, without\r\nbeing allowed to form a separate community, rescued a considerable\r\nnumber of Falashas from their unbelief, and nominally, but not\r\nvirtually, united them as a living, active and spiritual element, to the\r\ndead Church of the Amharas. We have circulated about one thousand whole\r\ncopies and portions of Scriptures; we have given an impulse to the study\r\nof the written vernacular; and we have stirred up a spirit of enquiry\r\namong Jews and Amharas, which must either terminate in a spontaneous\r\nreform, or lead (which is far more probable) to our expulsion and a\r\nrelentless persecution.\" The latter surmise proved to be only too true.\r\n\r\nThe following circumstances eventually led to the imprisonment of the\r\nmissionaries. King Theodore had despatched to the Queen of England, by\r\nConsul Cameron, a letter, to which, from some strange reason, no reply\r\nwas vouchsafed. A similar letter to Napoleon III. was indeed answered,\r\nbut the verbal message accompanying it gave dire offence. Theodore\r\nresolved to be revenged on all Europeans, and to \"humble the pride of\r\nEurope,\" as he said, meaning England and France.\r\n\r\nSome expressions in Stern's book, \"Wanderings among the Falashas in\r\nAbyssinia,\" as to Theodore's humble origin, also gave offence to the\r\ndusky monarch. When Stern paid him a visit, in order to ask permission\r\nto return home, the opportunity thus offered for revenge was seized.\r\nStern had with him two servants. The hour of the visit was unfortunately\r\nill chosen, and his servants' knowledge of Arabic so limited, as to\r\nrender their mode of interpreting so offensive to the King, that he\r\nordered them to be beaten,--an order so effectually obeyed, that they\r\ndied in the night. Stern, unable to endure the scene, turned round, and\r\nin his nervousness _bit his finger_,--unaware, or forgetful, that such a\r\ngesture was in Abyssinia indicative of _revenge_. At first, the King\r\nseemed inclined to overlook the matter, but subsequently, urged on by\r\nthose around him, Stern was struck down insensible, and, on recovery,\r\nbound hand to foot and consigned to prison.\r\n\r\nFor four and a-half years Stern remained a prisoner. It is impossible to\r\ndescribe his terrible sufferings and perilous position during that long\r\nprotracted \"period of heart-rending and heart-breaking martyrdom.\"\r\n\r\nRosenthal was the next victim; subsequently Consul Cameron, Flad and his\r\nwife, Mrs. Rosenthal, Consul Rassam, Lieutenant Prideaux, Blanc, Kerans,\r\nand others, were in turn imprisoned. Flad was shortly afterwards\r\nreleased, in order to be sent to England on an embassy to Queen\r\nVictoria, his wife and children being held as hostages for his return.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners remained in captivity--with a slight interval of freedom\r\nin the spring of 1866--first in one place, then in another, and\r\nsubsequently at Magdala--until Easter, 1868. An English expeditionary\r\nforce, under Sir Robert Napier, had arrived to effect their deliverance.\r\nIn answer to the demand of the English General, and perhaps in order to\r\npropitiate him, Theodore ordered the release of his prisoners. This\r\ntardy act of justice did not save him. A battle was fought on Good\r\nFriday between the English army and the hosts of Theodore, who was\r\ndecisively beaten. On Easter Monday the stronghold of Magdala was\r\nstormed and captured, and Theodore fell by his own hand. Most graphic\r\naccounts of these stirring days were sent home by Stern and Flad, the\r\nlatter of whom prefaced his remarks with the appropriate words, \"The\r\nLord has turned our captivity: we are like unto them that dream. Our\r\nmouth is filled with laughter, and our tongue with praise. We say, The\r\nLord has done great things for us! The Lord has done great things,\r\nwhereof we are glad.\"\r\n\r\nThe release of the missionaries by the military expedition sent out to\r\nvindicate the honour of the British nation, and to recover the person of\r\nits official representatives, was a wonderful answer to believing and\r\npersevering prayer. The missionaries returned to England in June, 1868;\r\nand, on July 3, a special meeting for prayer and thanksgiving was held\r\nat the Freemasons' Hall, the Earl of Shaftesbury, K.G., in the chair,\r\nwhen all the released missionaries, with their wives, were present, and\r\nin a few words told of their wonderful deliverance, and the Almighty arm\r\nwhich had wrought it.\r\n\r\nIt may here be mentioned that though since 1869, no European missionary\r\nhas been allowed in Abyssinia, the London Society's mission has never\r\nonce been suspended, notwithstanding overwhelming odds and almost\r\ninsuperable obstacles! Other missions have been given up for a time when\r\ndangers threatened--this has held on its way through the fostering care\r\nof Mr. J. M. Flad, who has supervised it from a distance, and the\r\nindomitable courage of the native missionaries. Like the early\r\nChristians, they have overcome by \"the blood of the Lamb, and by the\r\nword of their testimony: and they loved not their lives unto the death\"\r\n(Rev. xii. 11). Famine, war, bloodshed, imprisonment, ecclesiastical\r\njealousy, civil strife, the Dervish invasion, the coming of the\r\nItalians, have been potent enemies--powerful enough to harass and to\r\nimpede, but not to stop the work. Indeed, it has flourished beyond\r\nexpectation, and, in spite of ignorance and want of freedom, the Gospel\r\nhas spread amongst the Falashas, 2,000 of whom have been baptized.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the last period of Stern's life (1870-1885) which, though\r\nfree from stirring adventures and dangerous situations, was none the\r\nless active and full.\r\n\r\nFor some time after his return Stern was incessantly and altogether\r\nengaged in narrating his experiences to crowded audiences in every part\r\nof the country, who hung, with breathless interest, upon the terrible\r\nyet fascinating story of the Abyssinian mission. In subsequent years\r\nStern could very rarely be persuaded to recount the horrors of the past.\r\nOn one occasion, and that only, in response to the persuasive entreaty\r\nof friends in a south-coast town, did he ever tell the wonderful story\r\nof his sufferings and achievements in that far-off land. Either the\r\ninnate humility and modesty of the man, or painful memories, made it\r\nmost distasteful to unlock the door of the past.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 Dr. Ewald resigned his work as senior missionary in London. It\r\nwas no easy matter to find a man qualified to succeed him. Only one\r\nseemed possible, and that was Stern, whose health, undermined by his\r\nunparalleled sufferings in Abyssinia, no longer permitted him to serve\r\nthe Society in the East. He was appointed Ewald's successor from the 1st\r\nof January, 1871, and brought to his new sphere a ripe and unrivalled\r\nexperience in Jewish missionary work, gained, as we have seen, in\r\nPersia, Turkey, Arabia, and Abyssinia; and an acquaintance with a dozen\r\nor more languages, an invaluable possession for a missionary in the\r\nmetropolis, who has by personal intercourse and correspondence to deal\r\nwith Jews of different nationalities. Though Stern missed in England the\r\nrefined courtesy of the German, and the religious gravity of the\r\nOriental Jew, and consequently those winning qualities which helped on\r\nfriendly intercourse and mutual interchange of convictions between\r\nmissionary and Jew, he yet found that most of the Jews in England were\r\nable to discuss religious questions calmly and dispassionately. The\r\nthree chief means which Stern relied upon to win his way amongst the\r\nJews were circulation of tracts, domiciliary visitation, and special\r\nsermons in Spitalfields and Whitechapel. The last were highly\r\nsuccessful. Jews attended in large numbers, attracted by the fame of the\r\npreacher, and the glowing and burning eloquence which flowed from his\r\nlips as he pointed them to the Messiah. An attendance of from 400 to 500\r\nJews was of frequent occurrence. A German prayer meeting was substituted\r\nfor the service hitherto held on Friday evenings, in order to draw\r\ntogether some of the 2,000 proselytes, and numerous enquirers then in\r\nLondon. This paved the way for the establishment, later on, of the\r\n\"Hebrew Christian Prayer Union.\"\r\n\r\nThousands of Jews were addressed in public and in private, in streets,\r\nhouses, shops, churches and mission halls.\r\n\r\nA mission hall, situated in Whitechapel, was made a useful centre, where\r\nmeetings on Saturdays and other days were generally well attended. There\r\nwas a daily Bible Class held for Jews. Conversions and baptisms were\r\nnumerous; but, as Stern said in 1876, when speaking of results, and his\r\nwords are true for all time, and in every place as well as\r\nLondon:--\"Conversions, however few or many they may be, are not the\r\ngauge by which the progress of mission work amongst the Jews can be\r\nascertained. A man may be thoroughly convinced of the truth of the\r\nGospel, and yet hesitate to take the final and decisive step. He may\r\nshrink from the persecution, the trials, the troubles, and the\r\nsacrifices a public profession of his faith would entail. Of course no\r\none, who is truly concerned for his soul's eternal welfare, should be\r\nashamed to avow his convictions. Nevertheless, a strong faith and ardent\r\nlove are indispensably necessary to enable a catechumen to break through\r\nthe ties of cherished affection and friendship for the Gospel's sake.\r\nThat all are not destitute of these heavenly gifts, ever-recurring\r\ninstances testify. The greater majority, however, prefer to conceal\r\ntheir religious sentiments. They go to church, join in the services, and\r\neven contribute to missionary societies, and yet nominally profess to be\r\nJews.\"\r\n\r\nStern not only worked in London, but also held special services for Jews\r\nin many other towns. He combined with his mission work the supervision\r\nof the \"Wanderers' Home,\" a most useful institution for the reception of\r\nconverts and enquirers.\r\n\r\nIn 1874, on the thirtieth anniversary of his ordination, his Hebrew\r\nChristian and other friends presented him with a testimonial--a silver\r\ntea and coffee service--as a slight token of their esteem; and in 1881\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of\r\nDivinity. In 1884 he was elected a member of the Committee of the\r\nL.J.S., where his vast and varied experience was of the utmost use; and\r\nhe was also elected an Associate of the Victoria Institute.\r\n\r\nStern's work in London was carried on to the time of his death, which\r\noccurred, after much suffering, on May 13, 1885. The funeral service was\r\nheld in the Episcopal Jews' Chapel, Palestine Place, on May 18, in the\r\npresence of a large and sorrowing congregation, and his mortal remains\r\nlaid to rest in Ilford Cemetery. He was twice married: first, in 1850,\r\nto Miss Charlotte Elizabeth Purday, who died in 1874; and secondly, in\r\n1883, to Miss Rebecca Goff, daughter of S. D. Goff, Esq., of Horetown,\r\nCo. Wexford.\r\n\r\nAs a preacher Stern was eloquence itself; as a writer he had a most\r\ncharming and picturesque diction. His published journals and books, like\r\nthose of Dr. Wolff, are full of the most romantic incidents of\r\nmissionary experience. His published works were: \"Dawning of Light in\r\nthe East\" (1854), being an account of his work in Persia, Kurdistan and\r\nMesopotamia; \"Wanderings amongst the Falashas in Abyssinia\" (1862); and\r\n\"The Captive Missionary\" (1868), both narratives of his Abyssinian\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nThat he was of the spirit of which martyrs are made, the following\r\nextracts from his letters, written during the long and dreary days of\r\nhis captivity in Abyssinia, clearly demonstrate:--\r\n\r\n\"Thank God, in the midst of my troubles, cares and anxieties, I enjoy\r\nthe profoundest calm and resignation. It is true there are days when the\r\nheart pulsates with gratitude and joy, and there are days when it throbs\r\nbeneath the mortifying agonies of despondency. Sometimes I feel as if I\r\ncould not endure another week the fetters which encircle my limbs, and\r\nconfine me in painful inactivity to this desolate rock. Such rebellious\r\nsentiments I generally try to suppress, and if this is impossible, I\r\nseek comfort in the thought, that all is ordered in wisdom and infinite\r\nlove. Our heavenly Father hath, no doubt, an object in this protracted\r\ncaptivity, and when once the veil of mystery is lifted up, every\r\nincident and circumstance which hath wrung a prayer or extorted a groan\r\nfrom the grieved soul, will prove to have been in harmony with the\r\ndesigns of a gracious Providence, and fraught with inestimable\r\nblessings.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, \"Our nerves were horrible shattered, and our minds, too,\r\nwould have been unhinged, had not religion, with her solacing influence,\r\nsoothed the asperities and hardships of our existence. The Bible,\r\nprayers, and a morning and evening exposition of an appropriate passage\r\nwere the exercises in which we regularly engaged. No bitter gibes, no\r\nharsh expressions, no unbecoming word characterised our intercourse;\r\nreligion formed a wonderful bond of harmony, and when I looked on the\r\ndevout countenances that there hung over the inspired page, as I\r\ncommented on the selected text, I cherished the pleasing hope that the\r\nclouds, so big with wrath, had been charged with showers of everlasting\r\nmercy. At such a period--I say it solemnly--the punctured head, the\r\nriven side, the pierced feet, and the heavy cross of redeeming love, is\r\na sight that nerves and supports the drooping and desponding spirit. In\r\nmy distress and sorrow, I threw myself on the bosom of a sympathizing\r\nSaviour, and if I was not happy, I was at least resigned.\"\r\n\r\nNo one can estimate the abundance of spiritual harvest from the long\r\nlife of toil and labour which Stern spent to the honour and glory of his\r\nMaster. He sowed in tears, he led captivity captive, he turned many to\r\nrighteousness, and of him it may confidently be said, that he will shine\r\nas a _star_ for ever and ever.[23]\r\n\r\n\r\n[23] W. T. Gidney, \"Biographies of Eminent Hebrew Christians,\" 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTERN, Herman, gives the following sketch of his history:--\"My father\r\nwas a rabbi and teacher of the Talmud at Prague, at Strakenitz, and\r\nsomewhat later at Bamberg. I had the happiness to be instructed by him\r\nin the Bible and in the Talmud, from my tenth to my twenty-first year,\r\nand during this period of eleven years, I also attended some Christian\r\nschools. On the decease of my father, who died in his seventy-sixth\r\nyear, duty no longer demanded my residence at Bamberg, and having\r\napplied to the then 'Court Commission' (Hofcommission) at Würzburg, for\r\nthe situation of Jewish teacher at Höchburg, which was at that time\r\nvacant, I obtained it. The Jewish inhabitants of Höchburg were pious,\r\nand previous to my coming there the children of the rich had been\r\ninstructed by private tutors. But as the former had been unwilling that\r\nthe children of the less fortunate Jewish parents should share this\r\ninstruction, these felt themselves obliged to petition the authorities\r\nfor the appointment of a public teacher, which was answered, quite\r\nunexpectedly to the rich, by my installation. It was, therefore, to be\r\nexpected that the wealthier Jews would not be pleased with the new\r\nschool; and when at last the authorities would no longer suffer the\r\nprivate tutors to remain at Höchburg, obliging the rich Jews to send\r\ntheir children to the public school, the latter became to them an\r\nobject of hatred. This hatred to the school was now transferred to me,\r\nand I was persecuted in every possible way. The wealthier Jews\r\ncomplained of me, because I permitted the boys to sit bare-headed;\r\nbecause I kept no wash-basin in the school-room, and what gave me most\r\ntrouble, though it was not raised into a point of accusation, because I\r\nhad often inculcated the duty of love to Christians, whom the 'Shulchan\r\nAruch,' denominated idolaters.\r\n\r\n\"I endeavoured to conform in my religious instruction to the letter and\r\nspirit of the Holy Scriptures, and could not avoid alluding to the\r\ndefectiveness and emptiness of the synagogue ceremonial, as taught in\r\nthe Talmud and the Jewish code 'Shulchan Aruch.'\r\n\r\n\"This course was complained of before the chief rabbi of the district;\r\nand for my own security, I requested the Government that the rabbi be\r\ninstructed to superintend the religious instruction of my school, and to\r\nsubject it to one or two examinations annually. Mr. Bing, the chief\r\nrabbi, however, begged to be excused from doing so, stating that my\r\nreligious instruction did not please him. The Government then demanded\r\nof the rabbi either to propose one of the existing religious compendiums\r\nas a text-book for schools, or else to write one himself.\r\n\r\n\"The rabbi offered to do the latter. In the third year of my public\r\nservices, the Government sent me to the town of Heidingsfeld, and before\r\nleaving Höchburg, I received a testimonial from the royal\r\nschool-inspector of the district, expressing the satisfaction my labours\r\nhad given to the Government.\r\n\r\n\"I had been nearly two years in the school at Höchburg, when the\r\nGovernment sent me, and all other Jewish teachers of the kingdom, the\r\nnew text-book of the Mosaic religion which the rabbinical candidate, Dr.\r\nAlexander Behr, had written, under the surveillance and direction of the\r\nchief rabbi, Mr. Abraham Bing, and which the rabbi at Fürth, and many\r\nother influential Jewish ecclesiastics, had adopted; Government\r\nsignifying at the same time that it was the desire of His Majesty the\r\nKing to have this book introduced in all Jewish schools. I received\r\njoyfully this book, which promised to meet the urgent necessities of the\r\nschools. But I was doomed to severe disappointment; the 160 octavo pages\r\nwhich this volume contains, were almost entirely filled with ceremonial\r\nlaws, treating of phylacteries, inscriptions, fringes, circumcisions,\r\nmeats, the prohibition of shaving, the creed, &c. Not a word, and much\r\nless an exposition of morality, of conscience, of virtue, of holiness,\r\nof the condition and destiny of man.\r\n\r\n\"In that portion of the book which treats of God, there was an entire\r\nomission of His power, His wisdom, His goodness, His mercy and holiness,\r\nand of all the lessons derived from these attributes and perfections.\r\nNot even the Decalogue found a place in this work.\r\n\r\n\"The Messiah (as well as many other similar predictions) it explained to\r\nsignify a period of time when all men should know God and serve Him.\r\n\r\n\"I directed the attention of the Government to this dead skeleton,\r\nshewing that I could not receive this book as my guide in religious\r\ninstruction. I prayed for permission to follow my own course of\r\ninstruction, and pledged myself to have my lessons printed and submitted\r\nto the chief rabbi.\r\n\r\n\"My petition was granted; and this was the beginning of trouble. My book\r\non the 'Confirmation of Israelites' followed in 1829. It was the more\r\ngladly received by the public, since I confirmed all my positions by\r\nquotations from the Talmud, which I translated literally. The second\r\nvolume, which I published in 1835, under the title of the 'Tree of\r\nLife,' was as kindly received. Both these books continue as standards in\r\nmany schools of various countries, and prove that even the Talmudists of\r\nthe third, fourth, and fifth centuries drank from the evangelical source\r\nof life. In like manner also, 'The Confession of Faith of the\r\nIsraelites,' as delineated in my works, the 'Confirmation,' pages\r\n140-46, and the 'Tree of Life,' pages 226-243, remain in full credit\r\namong the Jews to this day, nor have the rabbis ventured to say ought\r\nagainst it, although it refers to the New Testament both in the text\r\nitself and in the notes.\r\n\r\n\"Five-and-twenty years have I been openly inculcating these principles\r\nin my schools and in the synagogues, and never have either the Jewish\r\ndeputies delegated by the Government to attend my public examinations,\r\nnor the great number of Jews who assisted on such occasions, uttered an\r\nobjection; this is a proof that my religious principles were not a\r\nbaseless fabric, or, as is too often the case in the statements of our\r\nrabbis, the result of mere whim or conjecture.\r\n\r\n\"The kindly, but often misconstrued feelings of His Majesty, Ludovic I.,\r\ntowards the Jews of his realm, which had been manifested by his\r\nestablishment of national schools for them, by the appointment of\r\nregularly educated rabbis, the free admission of the Jews to all the\r\nexisting Christian scholastic institutions, and the manifold favours\r\nenjoyed by Jewish mechanics, &c., were again shewn in the year 1836, by\r\nhis convoking of Jewish committees.\r\n\r\n\"These consisted of rabbis, Jewish teachers, and delegates of\r\ncommunities. They met in all the provincial capitals of the kingdom in\r\nthe public edifices, where they held regular sessions, under the\r\npresidency of a royal commissary, to solve such questions in\r\ntheological, scholastic, and social matters, as had arisen during the\r\nthen contemplated Jewish emancipation; and to give the Government their\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\n\"One of the questions before the Committee at Würzburg was--Whether the\r\nJewish doctrines acknowledge or reject the belief in the Trinity, as\r\ncontained in the Old Testament. The rabbis consulted on this weighty\r\npoint in private sessions, which I attended, having been chosen by a\r\nmajority of votes as one of the referees; and they thereupon declared in\r\nthe public session briefly that the doctrine of the Trinity is not\r\ncontained in the Old Testament, on which account also the Jews did not\r\nacknowledge this doctrine.\r\n\r\n\"The president then demanded that every one agreeing with the\r\ndeclaration of the rabbis should rise. All the rabbis, all the teachers,\r\nand all the delegates (116 individuals) arose. I only remained sitting,\r\nand then handed to the president a written notice, stating that I should\r\nbeg the rabbis, in a circular which should be printed, to give me an\r\nexplanation of various difficulties that I entertained on this point,\r\nbefore I could accede to the declaration made by them.\r\n\r\n\"My circular, entitled 'Israelitism in its Excellency and its Burden'\r\n('Israelitenthum in seiner Würde und Bürde) was printed during these\r\nsessions (which lasted six weeks), and produced a universal sensation.\r\nThe rabbis took it very ill that I had ventured on this step,\r\nnotwithstanding I had been shewn, as in a camera obscura, in glaring\r\ncolours, my prospective misery; but they did not answer my circular.\r\nOnly Dr. Romann, the chief rabbi at Cassel, and Mr. J. Heidegger, a\r\nteacher of the Talmud at Fürth, wrote each one a pamphlet against me.\r\nBoth of them, however, scarcely touched upon the point, and were\r\ncontented with abuse, cursing, and persecution.\r\n\r\n\"My school at Heidingsfeld was advised to institute a complaint against\r\nme, as having, through my circular, shaken the basis of my religion, and\r\nto found thereon a request for my removal. The Government, however,\r\ndeclined entertaining the complaint; since, by issuing my circular, I\r\nhad adopted the very course which the rabbis themselves had pointed out\r\nwhen asked how a Jew should proceed in case that religious doubts\r\nshould arise; since there was no supreme religious tribunal in existence\r\nto whom the case might be referred; the rabbis having declared that in\r\nsuch an event a circular letter stating the question should be addressed\r\nby the enquirer to all Jewish theologians.\r\n\r\n\"These reasons were too weighty to encourage an appeal to the royal\r\n'Ministerium,' although my opponents anticipated a favourable decision\r\nfrom this event for themselves, notwithstanding their unholy aim.\r\n\r\n\"They, however, preferred to accuse me anew as having transgressed my\r\nreligion, namely, by having taught in my schools that in case of\r\nnecessity the Jews were permitted to break the laws relating to the\r\nSabbath in order to relieve a fellow-man.\r\n\r\n\"I was cited and heard, and having confessed the truth of the charge,\r\nthe royal 'Ministerium' resolved on my penal removal to the school at\r\nMain-Stockheim.\r\n\r\n\"This severe penalty could not have been inflicted, if the rabbis had\r\nnot represented that Jews were not permitted to violate the Sabbatical\r\nlaws in order to relieve a fellow-man.\r\n\r\n\"I was therefore obliged to leave a town where so many persons and\r\nobjects were dear to me, and where I had enjoyed that rare happiness of\r\nteachers--to instruct the children of my former pupils. I was forced to\r\nleave two pretty little gardens which I had gradually raised on desert\r\nspots, and the trees which I had planted at the birth of each of my\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\"I departed; my wife and children followed me weeping, and the tears of\r\nmany others comforted me.\r\n\r\n\"In November, 1837, I arrived in the village of Main-Stockheim, the\r\nplace of destination, as the appointed Jewish teacher of religion. The\r\nJewish community belonged to the orthodox or pious class. I was shewn to\r\nthree small rooms as my residence, and their gloomy appearance was\r\nlittle calculated to cheer my mind.\r\n\r\n\"I observed that this dwelling could not accommodate myself and family;\r\nand begged the Jewish School-Community (Schulgemeinde) to grant me other\r\nrooms, or else to enlarge these; but it was in vain. I was obliged to\r\nconvert the lobby into a dormitory for my children. The little rooms,\r\nowing to their disproportionate loftiness, were cold and uncomfortable,\r\nand so damp that we had thick ice within, near the windows. My wife and\r\nsome of my children fell sick; and I felt myself obliged, and in duty\r\nbound, to petition the royal land-tribunal for the enlargement of my\r\ndwelling, and my petition was shortly granted.\r\n\r\n\"But the Jewish Warden appealed to a higher tribunal, the Government;\r\nand when the former decision was confirmed, they appealed to the\r\nMinisterium. Much time was thus lost, and I obtained at last an\r\nadditional room and a cellar.\r\n\r\n\"My salary was so small that I had to live partly on my own means; and\r\nyet the Jewish School-Community withheld from me part of the amount of\r\nfirewood granted me by law. Out of love of peace, I offered to\r\nrelinquish part of the withheld quantity of wood, if they would but\r\ngive the rest, so as to obviate the necessity of complaining to the\r\nGovernment; but I was forced to complain.\r\n\r\n\"The suit passed again all the various Courts as before, and was decided\r\nin my favour; the lawful quantity of wood was to be given me, and for\r\nthat which had been unjustly withheld I was to be indemnified. Although\r\nI had declined to accept the indemnification granted me by law--a\r\nrefusal very cheerfully accepted by my rich community--yet they did not\r\nneglect to avenge themselves upon me on the grounds of piety; being\r\naware that this was the likeliest way to compass their end. I was\r\naccused of the following sins, which I had actually committed.\r\n\r\n\"1. That I had not only permitted my female scholars to come to the\r\nsynagogue on Saturdays, but had commanded them to do so, in order to\r\nattend to the religious instructions which I there imparted.\r\n\r\n\"2. That I had cut my beard in Omer.[24]\r\n\r\n\"3. That, on one occasion, being called up to the reading of the Torah,\r\nI had appeared with gloves on.\r\n\r\n\"4. That I kept a Christian servant.\r\n\r\n\"5. That on the anniversaries of my parents' death, I did not lead the\r\nsynagogue service: and,\r\n\r\n\"6. That, although I would not allow my wife to use the 'dipping bath'\r\n(Tauchbad), I would persist in giving her my arm.\r\n\r\n\r\n[24] The period between the Passover and the Feast of Weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They stated that they could no longer suffer a man among them who was\r\nso immoral, so irreligious, and who excited so much scandal; and since\r\nno Christian court could decide on these Jewish sins, it was requested\r\nthat the chief rabbi should be heard, and that I should be discharged. I\r\nreplied: and respecting the last two points on which most stress seemed\r\nto be laid, I observed first, that it had been my father's dying request\r\nthat I should neither fast nor lead the synagogue service on the\r\nanniversaries of my parents' death, as the custom had originated in a\r\nsuperstition; and, secondly, that according to a medical testimonial\r\nwhich I laid before the court, my sick wife had been prohibited from\r\nusing the 'dipping bath;' but the decision of the chief rabbi was, that\r\nas I had confessed my wife neglected the bath, while, at the time, it\r\nwas proved that she had taken my arm in walking, I was worthy of death\r\naccording to Levit. xx. 18, and must be discharged from my office\r\nforthwith. I protested against this barbarous decision, and prayed to\r\nsubmit it to another Rabbinat. My petition was granted, but the rabbi of\r\nthe district, Mr. L. B. Bamberger, of Würzburg, declared that he fully\r\nagreed with the chief rabbi, and added that my wife also was worthy of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\"In consequence, I was discharged, lost the salary yet due to me, though\r\nthe Government had approved of my official labours, and I was adjudged\r\nas having forfeited even my claim upon the States Institution for the\r\nRelief of Orphans and Widows of German School Teachers, as well as my\r\nright to the 133 florins which I had already paid into that Institution.\r\nWith this bitter experience, and provided with most satisfactory\r\ntestimonials from my immediate superiors, I left my native country, and\r\nwent with my wife and children to the free town of Frankfort, where I\r\nenjoyed perfect peace in the capacity of a private tutor. From this\r\nbrief sketch it will sufficiently appear that the rabbinical Jewish\r\nreligion leads to and justifies the most revolting injustice and\r\ncruelty, a reproach which cannot be brought against Christianity.\"\r\n\r\nSTERN, Joseph Paul, a native of Hungary, where he had been a teacher and\r\nthen a merchant, came to Jerusalem in 1851, at the age of thirty-five.\r\nBecoming ill he was admitted on application to the L.J.S. hospital,\r\nwhere, one may say, without a shadow of a doubt, that he was truly\r\nconverted, and was baptized on Good Friday of that year. Henceforth he\r\ndevoted his life to preach the grace of God as manifested in Christ\r\nJesus, to his brethren in season and out of season. He was only a\r\nScripture reader, but few could resist his entreaties to accept\r\nsalvation through Christ, and the Jews feared him as well as respected\r\nhim, for he often rewarded them good for evil. In 1860 he visited his\r\nrelatives in Hungary, when he preached Christ to them, and escaped being\r\npoisoned. In 1872, when the Rev. A. Bernstein visited him in his\r\nsickness and administered the Holy Communion to him, he asked to be\r\ndressed in his best clothes, for he expected to go to the marriage of\r\nthe Lamb. But he lingered yet for a while and died in 1873, uttering\r\nwith his last breath--\"Christ is all.\"\r\n\r\nSTERN, Maximilian Christian Heinrich, was baptized by Dr. Poper at\r\nFrankfurt, in 1846, when two of his brothers became Christian preachers\r\nin America. He was then fifty-two years old. His family followed his\r\nexample two years later. In 1856 he published \"Die Jüdische\r\nZeitrechnung.\" He died in 1861. (See \"Jewish Missionary Intelligence,\"\r\n1846, page 123).\r\n\r\nSTERNCHUSS, Rev. P. H., after a course of preparation in the L.J.S.\r\nMissionary Training College, was sent, together with A. J. Behrens, to\r\nopen a mission at Safed in 1843, where they held a daily service and\r\ntried to have intercourse with the fanatical Jews, but were boycotted by\r\nthem. In 1844, they were both ordained in Jerusalem, and Sternchuss\r\naccompanied Stern to Bagdad, whence he itinerated to Mesopotamia,\r\nvisiting Hillah and Ezekiel's tomb twice, he also visited Persia. The\r\ntrying climate, the galling reproaches and persecutions, and the\r\nhardships which those early missionaries in the East endured, soon told\r\nupon Sternchuss, so that he had to resign on account of ill-health in\r\n1850, but continued still for a short time to labour for the Society in\r\nthe West of England.\r\n\r\nTARTAKOVER, Rev. E. M. Very little information can be obtained about\r\nthis servant of Christ, but that little is most interesting, inasmuch as\r\nit embraces a reflective comment on a long period of Church history in\r\nwhich Palestine and the Jewish residents there had no Hebrew Christian\r\nminister of the Gospel. On October 30th, 1842, Tartakover was ordained\r\nin Jerusalem by Bishop Alexander. Such an event as the ordination of a\r\nJewish convert had not been witnessed in the Holy City since Apostolic\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nTOMORY, Rev. A., after finishing his theological studies at Edinburgh,\r\nwas appointed by the Free Church of Scotland as a missionary at Pesth in\r\n1853. In 1864 he was transferred to Constantinople, where he carried on\r\na most faithful and fruitful work, both evangelistic and educational,\r\nduring the remainder of his earthly pilgrimage, and left a worthy\r\nmemorial in the home for enquiring Jews which he founded at Galata.\r\n\r\nTREMELLIUS, John Immanuel, was born at Ferrara in 1510; and died at\r\nSedan, October 9th, 1580. He was educated at the University of Padua,\r\nand baptized in the Roman Catholic Church about 1540, through the\r\ninfluence of Cardinal Pole, but embraced Protestantism in the following\r\nyear, and went to Strasburg to teach Hebrew. Owing to the wars of the\r\nReformation in Germany, he was compelled to seek refuge in England,\r\nwhere he resided at Lambeth Palace with Archbishop Cranmer in 1547. In\r\n1549 he succeeded Paul Fagius as Regius Professor of Hebrew at\r\nCambridge. On the death of Edward VI. he revisited Germany, and, after\r\nsome vicissitudes, became Professor of the Old Testament at Heidelberg\r\nin 1561. He ultimately found a home in the College of Sedan, where he\r\ndied. His chief literary work was a Latin translation of the Bible from\r\nthe Hebrew and Syriac. The five parts relating to the Old Testament were\r\npublished at Frankfurt between 1575 and 1579; in London in 1580, and in\r\nnumerous later editions. Tremellius also translated into Hebrew Calvin's\r\nCatechism (Paris, 1551), and wrote a Chaldaic and Syriac grammar (Paris,\r\n1569).\r\n\r\nTURCKHEIM, Rev. Ernest Julius, had been, at the age of twenty-one,\r\nmaster of a Jewish school at West Hartlepool, where he gave great\r\nsatisfaction to the parents of the children, so that they wished him to\r\nbecome their minister. In order that he should be able conscientiously\r\nto discharge his duties, Turckheim applied himself to a diligent study\r\nof the Old Testament. This in itself made him more serious than he had\r\nbeen before. Meeting with Mr. J. Alexander, then agent of the British\r\nand Foreign Bible Society at the Crystal Palace, he received from him a\r\nNew Testament, and through reading it earnestly he became convinced of\r\nthe truth of Christianity, and was baptized in 1873. He then studied at\r\nthe London College of Divinity, and was ordained at York in 1875-6 to\r\nthe curacy of St. Thomas there. In 1878 he was curate of All Saints',\r\nDerby. In 1879 he became curate of All Souls', Langham Place, London. In\r\n1882 he was appointed to the living of Hale Magna, in Lincolnshire,\r\nwhere he did good work until his death in 1907.\r\n\r\nSpeaking at the L.J.S. anniversary meeting in 1893, he said:--\"A Jew by\r\nbirth, a Jew by training and practice till I was twenty-four years old;\r\na Jew still by every feeling of national loyalty and sympathy, I thank\r\nGod that I can say, nevertheless I am also a Christian. And it is as a\r\nJew and a Christian I have responded to your invitation, and am standing\r\nhere to-day and make this solemn confession of my faith. It is due to\r\nthe grace of God, it is due to the power of His Word, which is the power\r\nof God unto salvation, unto every one that believeth--to the Jew first.\r\nIt is due, I must add, to the patience and forbearance, to the love and\r\nlabours, to the life and death, to the mediation and sufferings for me\r\nof our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. It is due to the prayers of God's\r\npeople, it is due to this Society. It is due to all of you who labour\r\nand pray, and make substantial sacrifices for the promotion of\r\nChristianity amongst the Jews. It is due that we Christian Jews who\r\nhave, by the grace of God, been brought out of Jewish darkness into the\r\nblessed and happy position of pardoned sinners by the blood of the\r\nCross, that we should fearlessly declare with no uncertain sound, that\r\nwhilst we are Christians by grace, we are still Jews by nature, by race,\r\nand by sympathy, and thus take a humble part in testifying to the\r\nblessed and everlasting truth that God has not cast away His people,\r\nthat there is still a remnant according to the election of grace. It is\r\ntwenty years since I ventured my eternal welfare with Jesus of Nazareth.\r\nAfter twenty years of mature deliberation and trial, I once more take my\r\nstand beside the Ethiopian eunuch, and declare to-day, with my heart\r\nfull of thankful gladness and humble faith, 'I believe that Jesus Christ\r\nis the Son of God.' Twenty years, we must observe, is a period wherein a\r\nman can make a test of a step that he has taken, and I never, never, for\r\none moment, have wavered in my conviction that 'there is none other name\r\nunder heaven given among men whereby we must be saved,' than the name of\r\nJesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\nVAMBREY, Hermann, was born in 1832 at Szerdahely, on the Island Schütt,\r\nHungary. He studied at Pressburg, especially modern languages, and\r\nbecame a member of the Reformed Church after his baptism. At the age of\r\ntwenty-two he became tutor in a Turkish family in Constantinople, and\r\nlater he travelled through Asia Minor, Armenia, Persia, Turkestan,\r\nBokhara, Samarkand and the regions of the Oxus. Dressed as a dervish he\r\npassed through all these countries unhurt, but was often in danger. He\r\nthen published his experiences and acquisitions in these journeys, in\r\nthe following works: \"German-Turkish Dictionary\" (Constantinople, 1858).\r\n\"Dsagataic Dictionary\" (Hungarian), (Pesth, 1861). \"An Etymological\r\nDictionary of Torkatartaric Languages\" (Leipzig, 1877). \"The Russian\r\nPower in Asia\" (_ib_., 1871). \"Central Asia\" and \"Anglo-Russian\r\nRelations\" (_ib_. 1873). \"Travels in Central Asia\" (_ib_., 1865).\r\n\"Sketches from Central Asia\" (_ib_. 1868). \"Wanderings and Experience in\r\nPersia\" (1867). \"Niguric Linguistic Documents\" (Innsbruck, 1870).\r\n\"History of Bokhara\" (Stuttgart, 1872). \"Islam in the 19th Century\"\r\n(Leipzig, 1875). \"Moral Pictures from the East\" (Berlin, 1876); and a\r\nnumber of other works. He wrote his autobiography under the titles,\r\n\"Arminius Vambrey, His Life and Adventures\" (London, 1883), and\r\n\"Struggles of my Life\" (_ib_., 1894).\r\n\r\nVANORDEN, Rev. E., a Dutch Jew, who was baptized by Dr. Ewald in 1863.\r\nHe afterwards studied for the ministry in America and was sent as a\r\nmissionary to Brazil, where he laboured at San Paulo for many years.\r\n\r\nVENETIANER, Pastor A., son of a Jewish rabbi, was converted through the\r\npreaching of the Rev. C. A. Schönberger. He afterward studied theology\r\nin Serftom. In 1879 he became Pastor in Panseora, Hungary, and\r\nafterwards in Trieste, where he wrote a book entitled: \"Die Evangelische\r\nreformite Kirche Cristo Salvatore zu Triest\" (Trieste and Leipzig,\r\n1887); and also an epistle to Rabbi J. Lichtenstein in Tapio Szele,\r\nentitled \"Zum Zeugniss\" (Vienna, 1886). Later on he became Pastor at\r\nRohrbach, South Russia, where he supported the movement of Rabinowitz.\r\n\r\nVICARS, Mrs. Murray, was the daughter of a wealthy Jewish merchant, and\r\nwas brought to a knowledge of the Saviour through her intercourse with a\r\nChristian nurse. Her father, when attending the dedication of a new\r\nsynagogue, took cold and became dangerously ill. His Jewish friends of\r\nthe synagogue came to visit him, but were afraid to tell him that he was\r\non the brink of the grave, and he died soon after. This brought her\r\nserious thoughts and led her to question the reason why the Jews shrink\r\nfrom mentioning the subject of death to a sick man. She had afterward to\r\nappear before a Court in reference to the property which her father had\r\nleft and to take an oath before the magistrate. An Old Testament was\r\nthen handed to her for that purpose, when she exclaimed before the whole\r\nassembly of Jews and Christians: \"The New Testament is for me.\" This\r\nraised a great commotion, but having taken this decisive step, she did\r\nnot hesitate to become a member of the Church by baptism. She afterward\r\nmarried the Rev. Murray Vicars, and went with him to Bagdad to labour\r\namongst the Jews there. On their journey back to England on account of\r\nill-health, her husband died at Marseilles, in 1850, and she settled at\r\nBrighton, where she founded a school for ragged children. It must be\r\nadded that her sister, too, embraced Christianity, and she left three\r\nsons, clergymen of the Church of England, two of them are especially\r\nwell known--the Rev. Charles Neil and the Rev. James Neil. The latter\r\nwas incumbent of Christ Church, Mount Zion, from 1871-74.\r\n\r\nThe maiden name of Mrs. Murray Vicars was Fanny Phillips; her brother\r\nSamuel was a distinguished man of letters.\r\n\r\nWALLFISCH, Rev. J. H., was brought to a knowledge of Christ by Professor\r\nCassel at Breslau, and after his baptism there he was for a time in the\r\nservice of the Free Church of Scotland. He emigrated to the United\r\nStates and, joining the Methodist Episcopal Church, became secretary of\r\nthe Jewish mission of that body, founded an \"Institutum Judaicum\"\r\namongst the students of the Anglo-German College at Golena, and received\r\nfrom Milton College the degree of Doctor of Music.\r\n\r\nWEISS, Edward, was converted through the instrumentality of Dr.\r\nZuckerkandl at Rustschuk, Bulgaria, in 1869, where he was for some time\r\nteacher in the mission school. On account of the Russo-Turkish war, he\r\nwas removed by the British Society for the Propagation of the Gospel\r\namongst the Jews to Vienna, and assisted Salkinson. At least thirty of\r\nhis enquirers were baptized there. The rest of his life was spent in\r\npreaching the Gospel at Pressburg, where he had frequent intercourse\r\nwith the students of the Rabbinic Seminary there. He died in 1905.\r\n\r\nWOLF, Philipp, D.D., was baptized in 1554. He wrote \"Spiegel der Juden,\"\r\nin which he brings proofs from Moses and the prophets that Jesus is the\r\nMessiah, and gives information concerning the Jewish prayers, some of\r\nwhich he quotes in German, and also in reference to the \"Shem\r\nHamphorath,\" or ineffable name of God. (Wolff, Bib. Heb. 3 N. 1830 c.)\r\n\r\nWOLFF, Joseph. The two great missionary explorers of the nineteenth\r\ncentury were David Livingstone and Joseph Wolff. The labours of the\r\nformer were chiefly confined to Negro races of the \"Dark Continent\";\r\nwhereas the latter made most extensive journeys amongst the various\r\nremnants of the tribes of Israel scattered throughout Africa and Asia.\r\nThe lives of both these great men touch upon all that is romantic and of\r\nthrilling interest in the wide range of exploration, and none the less\r\nso because they consecrated themselves to their Master's service, and,\r\nwith a consuming zeal for souls, went forth to seek and to save the\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nJoseph Wolff was the pioneer missionary to Jews in the Orient. Like St.\r\nPaul, he, too, was \"in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils\r\nof robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen,\r\nin perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness.\" His almost\r\nsuperhuman efforts in the third and fourth decades of last century cast\r\na halo of romance around Jewish missions, and laid the foundation for\r\nmuch subsequent work. Within the short period of sixteen years we find\r\nhim visiting Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Asia Minor, Asiatic Turkey,\r\nPersia, India, Bokhara, Abyssinia and Arabia--and some of these\r\ncountries more than once. Verily, he compassed sea and land to make\r\nproselytes to the faith, of which he became such a doughty champion.\r\n\r\nThe life of this remarkable man naturally falls into three periods--his\r\nearly years as a Jew; his missionary efforts amongst his brethren; and\r\nhis last years quietly and uneventfully passed in country parishes in\r\nEngland. Our chief concern is with the middle period, to which, however,\r\nwe can do but scant justice, as its constant and restless action and\r\nstirring adventures overwhelm us with an embarrassment of riches.\r\n\r\n\"Wolff,\" as he was simply called, after his grandfather, was born at\r\nWeilersbach, a small Bavarian village, in 1795, or 1796,[25] of Jewish\r\nparents, his father, whose name was David, belonging to the tribe of\r\nLevi. He was the rabbi of the small Jewish community of the place,\r\nnumbering fifteen families, but soon after the birth of his son he\r\nremoved to Halle. In his very early years the boy received a strict\r\nJewish education, and at the age of six recited the Hebrew prayer-book\r\nevery day. He was then sent to a Christian school, but apparently only\r\nto learn German. When Wolff was eleven years old he was placed at the\r\nProtestant Lyceum at Stuttgart, but growing dissatisfied with it, he\r\nwent to reside with his cousin, Moses Cohen, at Bamberg, and entered the\r\nRoman Catholic Lyceum of that place. He there made up his mind to become\r\na Christian and a missionary like Francis Xavier. But he was unsettled\r\nin the extreme in his search after the truth, and wandered to Würzburg,\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Main, Halle, Prague, Vienna, Pressburg, back again to\r\nVienna, Mölk, Munich, Anspach, Saxe Weimar, Heidelberg, Soleure, and\r\nfinally arrived at Prague. There he was baptized by the Abbot of the\r\nBenedictine Monastery Emaus, in the year 1812, at the age of seventeen,\r\nreceiving the name of \"Joseph.\" At his confirmation shortly afterwards\r\nhe received the two further names of \"Stanilaus Wenceslaus,\" which,\r\nhowever, he never used.\r\n\r\n\r\n[25] Wolff himself is responsible for this uncertainty, having supplied\r\nthese two different dates. \"Travels and Adventures,\" vol. 1, p. 2, and\r\n\"Missionary Journal and Memoir,\" p. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Wolff was by this time proficient in the Latin, Persian,\r\nChaldean, and Syriac languages, and entered the University of Vienna to\r\nstudy Arabic, Ecclesiastical History, and Divinity. There he remained\r\ntwo years. In 1814 he resided with Count Stollberg, and, like every one\r\nelse, was much exercised at Napoleon's escape from Elba. In 1815 Wolff\r\nentered the Lutheran University of Tübingen to pursue his studies in\r\nOriental languages and theology; but he left the next year on a\r\npilgrimage to Rome, travelling on foot through Switzerland and Italy\r\nuntil he reached the Eternal City. Being introduced to Pope Pius VII.,\r\nhe shewed him a Hebrew Bible which had been the companion of his\r\ntravels. Wolff entered the Collegio Romano, and in 1817 the Propaganda,\r\nfrom which his Protestant leanings, and neglect of scholastic divinity\r\nfor the Bible, caused his expulsion in 1818. Wolff now returned to\r\nVienna, lamenting that his missionary aspirations had been frustrated.\r\nIn his distress of mind he wrote to Hoffbauer, Vicar-General of the\r\nLiguorians, who received him into his monastery. Wolff was not happy\r\nthere for more than a few months, and leaving Vienna, travelled through\r\nAustria to the Benedictine monastery of Krems-Münster, where he was well\r\nreceived by the monks. Too restless to remain long in any place, Wolff\r\ntravelled through Bavaria, Switzerland, and France, entering first this\r\nmonastery and then that. At Paris he met with Robert Haldane, who\r\nexercised a powerful religious influence over him; and with whom he\r\njourneyed to London.\r\n\r\nWe naturally find our interest in this talented and eager youth\r\nincreasing on his arrival in England, in 1819, at the age of\r\ntwenty-four, when he came under the notice of Mr. Henry Drummond, the\r\nRev. Charles Simeon, the Rev. Lewis Way, and other well-known friends of\r\nIsrael. Wolff made his way, as almost every baptized or enquiring Jew\r\ndid when first arriving in this country, to \"Palestine Place,\" the\r\nmissionary headquarters of the London Society for Promoting Christianity\r\namongst the Jews, where all were sure of a hearty welcome. He attended\r\nthe service in the Episcopal Jews' Chapel, conducted by the chaplain,\r\nthe Rev. Charles Sleech Hawtrey, and, to use his own words, was\r\n\"enchanted with the devotion and beauty of the ritual.\" Henceforth he\r\nconsidered himself a member of the Church of England. The Society sent\r\nhim to Cambridge to be trained as a missionary, and to study theology\r\nunder Simeon (himself of Jewish extraction), and other Oriental\r\nlanguages under Professor Lee. Two years' residence there, and a short\r\ncourse at the London Society's Seminary in Sussex, were sufficient for\r\nthe zealous young convert who was longing for active missionary service\r\nabroad. Mr. Drummond sent him forth on his career. His feverish anxiety\r\nto be thus employed is seen in his selection of the words of Francis\r\nXavier, \"Who would not travel over land and sea to be instrumental in\r\nthe salvation of one soul?\" as the motto for the title page of his\r\n\"Travels.\" Wolff left England in April, 1821, and with passing calls at\r\nGibraltar, and Malta (where he baptized a Jew) in due time he reached\r\nAlexandria. He spent three months amongst the Jews of that city and of\r\nCairo, preaching in their synagogues, and distributing New Testaments. A\r\nvisit which he paid to the Convent of St. Catherine, Mount Sinai, is\r\ninteresting from the fact that the monks promised to pray for the\r\nconversion of the Jews.\r\n\r\nWolff's eyes, however, were fixed on the Holy City, and his work in\r\nEgypt was regarded by himself as a \"preparation for preaching the Gospel\r\nof Christ at Jerusalem.\" He did so first in the synagogue of the\r\nKaraites; and afterwards made daily efforts for three or four months to\r\nreach the Sephardim, Ashkenazim and Chassidim, both by word of mouth and\r\ncirculation of the Holy Scriptures.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1822, Wolff visited Antioch and Aleppo, just before\r\nthe terrible earthquake visitation of the latter city, when hundreds of\r\nJews confessed that the truth of the Gospel could not be denied. In the\r\nspring of 1823 he was again in Egypt following up his previous work, and\r\ngoing on to Jerusalem for Easter. His three months' labour there amongst\r\nthe Jews, thus described by himself, \"I lodged among them, and was\r\nengaged in preaching the Gospel from morning to night, and often all\r\nnight,\" cleared the way for subsequent efforts.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Wolff visited Damascus, where the Jews eagerly accepted\r\nthe Arabic Bibles which he had with him, and Aleppo, where he was again\r\nwell received.\r\n\r\nWolff's account of his visit to Bagdad in 1824, and other cities of\r\nMesopotamia, is most interesting reading. He seems to have visited the\r\nscattered communities of Jews, amongst all of whom he had easy access.\r\nAt Mosul he was shewn a Hebrew translation of the New Testament which\r\nhad been made by a rabbi a hundred years previously. Left as a precious\r\nheirloom to the rabbinical college, it had remained neglected until\r\nWolff pointed out its priceless value. At Orfa, the ancient \"Ur of the\r\nChaldees,\" Wolff found about fifty Jewish families, and some Jacobites,\r\nor Syrian Christians, claiming to be lineally descended from Jews who\r\nreceived Christianity through the preaching of St. James at Jerusalem.\r\nTheir peculiar ceremonies, as also their features, gave colour to their\r\nclaim to be literal as well as spiritual children of Abraham.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Wolff visited the various Jewish communities of Persia, who,\r\nperhaps, have better grounds than any other people to be regarded as\r\ndescendants of the \"Lost Ten Tribes.\" In 1827 and 1828 Wolff visited the\r\nIonian Islands and Asia Minor. At Smyrna he awakened, as indeed he did\r\neverywhere, a widespread enquiry into Christianity on the part of the\r\nJews.\r\n\r\nProbably the most romantic and thrilling of all Wolff's experiences were\r\nthose which he encountered at Bokhara in 1832. \"Adventures to the\r\nadventurous\" is a truism, and Wolff was bold and daring to the last\r\ndegree, otherwise he would not have accomplished his purpose. He dressed\r\nas a Turkoman, and so obtained an audience of the king, when he was\r\ndenounced as a Russian spy by the Jews. By his wonderful adroitness he\r\novercame all opposition, and received permission to evangelize the Jews,\r\nbut was forbidden to hold religious converse with Moslems. He took\r\nlodgings at the house of a Jew, and was visited by his brethren, who\r\nasserted that their forefathers had been carried from Samaria by the\r\nKings of Assyria and brought to Haran (Isa. xxxvii. 12), _i.e._,\r\nBokhara. The three months spent there by Wolff, especially amongst the\r\nlearned class, were fruitful, and he baptized as many as twenty. These\r\nmen had all remained faithful when he visited Bokhara again in 1844.\r\nThat second visit, more hazardous even than the first, was made with the\r\npurpose of ascertaining the fate of Colonel Stoddart and Captain\r\nConolly,--two Englishmen, who, as subsequently transpired, had been\r\nmurdered. Wolff's arrival in the city was witnessed by 20,000 persons\r\nshouting \"welcome\" to the enterprising traveller, whose costume--gown,\r\nhood, and shovel-hat--roused no small astonishment. Wolff obtained\r\npermission from the king for the Jews to repair their ancient\r\nsynagogue.[26]\r\n\r\n\r\n[26] \"Narrative of a Mission to Bokhara.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1833 we find Wolff in India, visiting the white and the black Jews of\r\nCochin, and the Beni-Israel of Poona, Calcutta and Bombay. This was not\r\nan unexplored field, as the L.J.S. missionaries had been working there\r\nfrom 1820 to 1830. Wolff found plenty to do, and at Calcutta, for six\r\nsuccessive days, talked twelve hours on end to all who came to his\r\n\"retreat.\"\r\n\r\nHitherto Asia had been the principal scene of Wolff's labours, but in\r\n1835 he was in Abyssinia and in 1836 in Arabia, visiting the Yemen. At\r\nSanaa he expounded Isaiah liii. to the Jews, and subsequently baptized\r\nfour with their families. The Jews were polygamists, but apparently\r\ndissatisfied with the state of things thus entailed.\r\n\r\nLack of space prohibits us from enlarging on Wolff's labours in the\r\nEast. His own descriptions remain to this day the most entertaining of\r\nmissionary annals, and bear witness to the wonderful activity of the man\r\nwhose striking personality, not unmixed with a harmless and naive\r\negotism, carried him through numberless dangers, and extricated him from\r\nperilous situations. The restlessness of his nature, which in early life\r\nimpelled him to wander over Europe in search of light and learning,\r\ndeveloped in succeeding years into that consecrated fiery energy and\r\nimpulse which made him so peculiarly fitted to play the _rôle_ of\r\npioneer missionary. Many of his friends, as he said, \"believed him to be\r\nElijah,\" though he archly added, \"he always believed himself to be\r\nJoseph Wolff!\" But a pioneer he was in every sense of the word, and as\r\nsuch rendered yeoman service to a cause, which more than all others,\r\nperhaps, needs all the glamour and romance it can call to its aid. So\r\ngreat was his dramatic power in describing his travels that Archbishop\r\nWhately proclaimed him to be \"a missionary Shakespeare.\"\r\n\r\nWolff had an iron constitution and a powerful frame, absolutely\r\nimpervious to matters of climate, and privations, however severe and\r\nenduring. He records that, when travelling in India in 1832, he was\r\nstripped of everything, and in danger of being \"made into sausages,\" and\r\n\"had to walk without a rag of clothing on for 600 miles from the Hindu\r\nKoosh to the Punjaub, through storms and snow!\" He was relieved and\r\nclothed at Cabul by Lieutenant Burnes. Wolff's character, wonderful\r\nactivity, and resources, were thus caustically summed up by one who\r\nknew him:--\r\n\r\n\"He appears to me to be a comet without any perihelion, and capable of\r\nsetting a whole system on fire. When I should have addressed him in\r\nSyria, I heard of him at Malta, and when I supposed he was gone to\r\nEngland, he was riding like a ruling angel in the whirlwinds of Antioch,\r\nor standing unappalled among the crumbling towers of Aleppo. A man who\r\nat Rome calls the Pope 'the dust of the earth,' and at Jerusalem tells\r\nthe Jews that the 'Gemara is a lie'; who passes his days in disputation,\r\nand his nights in digging in the Talmud; to whom a floor of brick is a\r\nfeather-bed and a box is a bolster; who makes or finds a friend alike in\r\nthe persecutor of his former or of his present faith; who can conciliate\r\na Pasha or confute a patriarch; who travels without a guide, speaks\r\nwithout an interpreter, can live without food, and pay without money,\r\nforgiving all the insults he meets with, and forgetting all the flattery\r\nhe receives; who knows little of worldly conduct, and yet accommodates\r\nhimself to all men without giving offence to any--such a man (and such\r\nand more is Wolff) must excite no ordinary degree of attention in a\r\ncountry and among a people whose monotony of manners and habits has\r\nremained undisturbed for centuries. As a pioneer I deem him matchless,\r\n_aut inveniet viam, aut faciet_; but, if order is to be established or\r\narrangements made, trouble not Wolff. He knows of no church but his\r\nheart, no calling but that of zeal, no dispensation but that of\r\npreaching. He is devoid of enmity towards man, and full of the love of\r\nGod. By such an instrument, whom no school hath taught, whom no college\r\ncould hold, is the way of the Judæan wilderness preparing.... Thus are\r\nhis brethren provoked to emulation and stirred up to inquiry. They all\r\nperceive, as everyone must, that whatever he is, he is in earnest; they\r\nacknowledge him to be a sincere believer in Jesus of Nazareth, and that\r\nis a great point gained with them, for the mass of the ignorant and\r\nunconverted Jews deny the possibility of real conversion from\r\nJudaism.\"[27]\r\n\r\n\r\n[27] The Rev. Lewis Way, quoted in \"Travels and Adventures of Dr.\r\nWolff,\" vol. i., p. 287.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Sir Charles Napier said that Wolff had \"worked harder for\r\nreligion, and had gone through more dangers for it, with a brave heart,\r\nthan any man living.\"\r\n\r\nOf his life in England as a parochial clergyman, but little can be said\r\nin this biography. He married, when a young man, the daughter of the\r\nEarl of Orford, Lady Georgiana Walpole, with whom he lived happily for\r\nthirty years, and whose son was Sir Henry Drummond Wolff. When he\r\nsettled in England, he became vicar of Linthwaite, a small village in\r\nYorkshire. His friend, Henry Drummond, after whom he had named his son,\r\nwrote, \"Your call is to be an evangelist for all the nations of the\r\nearth, and for this you are fit; but, to use your own simile, you are as\r\nfit for a parish priest as I am for a dancing-master.\" Wolff shortly\r\nafterwards removed, on account of his wife's health, to the sole charge\r\nof High Hoyland, another Yorkshire village, with about 120 souls. There,\r\ntoo, he must have felt like a lion in a cage; and when, five years\r\nlater, he resigned his charge on the ground of not being able to meet\r\nhis expenses, and undertook his second journey to Bokhara, he must\r\nindeed have rejoiced in an aftermath of the freedom and action of his\r\nearlier career. One little incident is too good to be omitted. Before\r\nWolff entered upon the curacy, his predecessor, doubting the sentiments\r\nof his successor, preached his farewell sermon from the text, \"After my\r\ndeparture shall grievous wolves enter in among you.\" Wolff remarks,\r\n\"However, he was very merciful, and made no allusion to the coming\r\n'Wolff' in his sermon!\"\r\n\r\nOn his return from Bokhara, Wolff was appointed to the living of\r\nIsle-Brewers, in Somersetshire, with a population of 300, amongst whom\r\nwere two farmers, all the rest being peasants. There Wolff remained for\r\nthe remainder of his life, his talents and brilliant gifts being wasted\r\nin such retirement, but his energy knowing no diminution. He built a new\r\nparsonage and schools, defraying a portion of the expense from the\r\nproceeds of his works and lectures; and erected a new church, for the\r\ncost of which he laid all his numerous friends and everybody else, under\r\ncontribution by incessant correspondence and personal applications. He\r\nwas a father to his poor, and every winter supported thirty-five\r\nfamilies with the necessities of life. Wolff was the neighbour and firm\r\nfriend of George Anthony Denison, \"dearer to him than any,\" although\r\ntheologically in the opposite camp. Amongst Wolff's other numerous\r\nfriends and acquaintances, we may mention the names of Sir Walter Scott,\r\nDean Stanley, Dean Hook, Alfred Tennyson, and Alfred and Margaret Gatty.\r\n\r\nWolff died in 1862, at the age of 66 or 67 years--a long life, when the\r\nrestless activity of brain and body is taken into account, and a full\r\nlife, in every sense of the word. He exemplified in his person the\r\nsaying, \"It is better to wear out than to rust out.\" And his epitaph\r\nmight well have been, \"The zeal of Thine house hath eaten me up.\"\r\n\r\nWOLFF, Oscar Ludwig Bernard, was born in Altona, 1799. After embracing\r\nChristianity (the date uncertain) he held the professorship of modern\r\nlanguages and literature successively at Weimar and at Jena, where he\r\ndied in 1851. His literary works appeared at Jena in 1841-43 in fourteen\r\nvolumes. The best known of his works are \"Poetischer Hausschatz des\r\nDeutschen Volkes\" (Leipzig, 1839); \"Hausschatz Deutscher Prosa\" (_ib._,\r\n1855) and \"Geschichte des Deutschen Romans,\" Jena 1843.\r\n\r\nWOLKENBERG, Rev. Marcus. Mordecai Wolkenberg (for such was his Jewish\r\nname) was born in 1834 in Russian Poland. When quite young he was\r\nsmuggled over the border into Galicia (Austrian Poland) to avoid being\r\nChristianized and trained for military service, it often being the\r\ncustom in the time of the Emperor Nicholas I. to seize Jewish lads for\r\nthose ends. Mordecai was placed by his parents with pious and orthodox\r\nrelatives at Brody, where he gained the interest of the famous rabbi of\r\nthe town, Salomon Kluger, and through his teaching soon acquired a good\r\nHebrew and Talmudical education. When quite a young man he was appointed\r\ntutor in the home of the rich banker Cahner at Jassy, where he remained\r\nabout two years. During his stay there he made the acquaintance of the\r\nRev. W. Mayer, the L.J.S. missionary. After a time of great\r\nheart-searching and deep spiritual experience, he was led to embrace the\r\nChristian faith, and was baptized. Thereupon he had to pass through a\r\nperiod of bitter trial and persecution, instigated chiefly by his\r\nemployer. His occupation had brought him in contact with many people.\r\nAll these forsook him when he made his public confession of\r\nChristianity. At length he had to leave Jassy, and, after a while,\r\nMarcus (as his name now was) went to the Malta Protestant College; later\r\non he came to London, when he read theology with the Rev. A. S.\r\nThelwall. In 1863 he was appointed an assistant missionary at Jassy.\r\nThis was a great trial to his feelings and faith, for it was there that\r\nhe first found Christ, and there, in consequence, that he had first\r\ntasted the venom of religious hatred. Here, however, to his surprise, he\r\nwas sought for and visited by numbers of his former acquaintances. A\r\nwide door, and effectual, was thus opened to him, one result of years of\r\npatient school and other missionary work by those who had long laboured\r\nin Jassy. Of this circumstance he says: \"Most of these visitors were\r\nteachers, some merchants, and others near relatives of one of the\r\nwealthiest Jews here. Nor has the bold proclamation of the truth, on my\r\npart, deterred them from continuing their intercourse with me.\" For\r\nseven years he thus worked in Jassy and in Bacau for Christ, and with\r\nmuch blessing. In 1870, owing to the illness of his wife, he had to\r\nreturn to England; where he laboured successively in London, Manchester,\r\nBirmingham, and lastly in Liverpool, where he died April 17th, 1900,\r\nvery much regretted by all who knew him, and not least by many Jews, who\r\nspoke in the highest terms of his goodness, piety, and scholarship.\r\n\r\nXERES, Jonah ben Jacob, was a native of North Africa, where he came in\r\ncontact with English Christian merchants and learned the truth as it is\r\nin Jesus from them. In 1707 he came to London and was instructed and\r\nbaptized by Dr. Allix in 1709. He then wrote an \"Address to the Jews,\"\r\ncontaining his reasons for leaving the Jewish and embracing the\r\nChristian religion. (See Wolff Bib. Heb., 14, N. 823.)\r\n\r\nThe book is dedicated to the then Archbishop of York (in 1709), and\r\nprefaced by an attestation to the respectability of the author by seven\r\nLondon merchants, and another by the learned Dr. Allix.\r\n\r\n\"We, whose names are underwritten, merchants trading into Barbary in\r\nAfrica, do hereby certify, all whom it may concern, that we, each of us,\r\nhaving formerly lived for several years in those parts, did then, as we\r\ndo now, personally know Jonah ben Jacob Xeres, who was born in Saphia, a\r\nsea-port town on that coast. His parents, being Hebrews, were reputed\r\nto be honest and substantial people; who employed much care in educating\r\nthis their son, Jonah, in the Jewish religion, and no less expense in\r\ninstructing him in the Hebrew, Arabic, and Chaldean tongues. He the said\r\nJonah lived in that country a professed Jew, till the age of five and\r\ntwenty, or thereabouts; and always behaved himself sober in his\r\nconversation, and no less just in his dealing, as some of us have\r\nexperienced, having had occasion to employ him on several accounts,\r\nwhereby, amongst other conversation, he had an opportunity of\r\ndiscoursing with some in our factory about matters of religion; and, as\r\nhe now informs us, was thereby possessed with some notion, that the\r\nMessiah had already come; whereby, being uneasy under such a weighty\r\ndoubt, he came over to England about eighteen months ago, in order to\r\nacquire a full satisfaction. After some time here, he applied himself to\r\nsome of us to recommend him to some learned Divine for information;\r\nwhereupon he was sent to the Rev. Dr. Allix, on whom some of us have\r\nsince waited, who, requesting of us a character of the said Jonah, is\r\nthe occasion of this paper, which we do in all respects believe to be\r\ntrue, and have a very good opinion of the probity and sincerity of the\r\nabove-mentioned Jonah; and that we trust upon his examination, he will\r\nprove to the judgment of the Most Reverend the Archbishops, the Right\r\nReverend the Bishops, the Reverend the Clergy, and all other pious\r\nChristians, to whom we recommend him, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Done at London, this eight and twentieth day of May, one thousand\r\nseven hundred and nine.\r\n\r\n\"Peter Fleuriot, Samuel Robinson, John Lodington, John Adams, Val.\r\nNorton, Robert Colmore, Thomas Coleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"These are to certify, that upon several discourses had with the\r\naforementioned Jonah ben Jacob Xeres, I have found him very well\r\nacquainted with the Holy Scriptures of the Old Testament, and all\r\nother Jewish and particularly Talmudical learning; so that he was\r\nvery ready, upon the chief objections that Jews make to the\r\ndoctrine, deity, and office of our Saviour. But, as he is endowed\r\nwith very good natural and acquired parts, I was the more able to\r\nsatisfy and convince him of the truth; so that, after having\r\nexamined by Scripture all the most material controversies, he hath\r\nfreely declared to myself, and his other friends, his desire to\r\nrenounce the errors and prejudices of his education in the Jewish\r\nreligion, and to embrace and profess the Christian faith.\r\n\r\n\"Witness my hand this 30th day of July, 1709.\r\n\r\n                                              \"Peter Allix, D.D.\"\r\n\r\nZABANSKI, J., was born at Minsk in Lithuania. His father, a bigoted\r\nTalmudist, sent him once on an errand to a Christian nobleman, who made\r\nhim a present of a Hebrew New Testament which, on coming home, he\r\ninnocently enough shewed his father, and was peremptorily told to take\r\nit back. This excited in him the curiosity to know the contents of the\r\nbook, and he soon procured one. Detected in reading it, he was punished\r\nby his father more than once, and at last the father got the police to\r\ngive him twenty-five strokes with a rod for disobedience. The\r\nconsequence was that he got ill and had to be taken to a hospital. After\r\nbeing there nine weeks, he ran away, obtained a situation as a teacher\r\nin a family for three years, where he got possession of a German New\r\nTestament and Dr. McCaul's \"Old Paths.\" He then returned to his father\r\nand asked his permission to go abroad. As this was not granted, he again\r\nran away, and this time to Constantinople, where he heard the Gospel\r\nfrom a missionary named Goldberg. Thence he went to Jerusalem, and was\r\nadmitted by Hershon into the House of Industry. His countrymen there,\r\nwho knew his father as a learned Talmudist, tried every means to snatch\r\nhim away from the Mission. They even went to Rachel's grave to pray for\r\nhis return to Judaism, and finally sent two Jews to his father to come\r\nand fetch him, but Zabanski became a Christian and laboured afterwards\r\nas a missionary of the L.J.S. from 1864 to 1867, and for a long period\r\nas an agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society, in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nZECKHAUSEN, Rev. Leopold. The following is from his own pen:--\r\n\r\n\"I was born in December, 1862, at Kovno in Russia, of strictly orthodox\r\nJewish parents, and, with the rest of my brothers, I got the usual\r\neducation of rabbinical Jews. My mother, like so many mothers in Israel,\r\nwould fain have seen me devoting myself entirely to the Talmud. I was to\r\nbe the rabbi of the family. My inclinations, however, were in the\r\ndirection of secular knowledge, and my father was broad-minded enough\r\nnot to insist upon an exclusively rabbinical training. At the age of\r\neleven I was accordingly sent to the local Gymnasium, or grammar school.\r\nAfter a stay of six years at this school I left Russia with the\r\nintention of studying medicine at the University of Koenigsberg in\r\nPrussia. But six months later financial difficulties, in which my father\r\nfound himself, necessitated my dropping the studies and accepting a post\r\noffered me in an office (July, 1881.)\r\n\r\n\"Once in business I threw myself heart and soul into my new vocation,\r\nand kept on rising steadily. At the end of ten years spent in business\r\nhouses in Koenigsberg, Frankfort and Amsterdam, I was offered a\r\npartnership at Libau in Russia. I declined it, however, after some\r\ndeliberation, and decided to leave business for good (1891).\r\n\r\n\"That step was the outcome of another and a more important one, which I\r\nhad taken three years previously, and which proved to be the turning\r\npoint of my life. While still at my father's house I had begun to get\r\nweary of the endless, and often meaningless ceremonies of rabbinical\r\nJudaism. In Germany and Holland, surrounded by general religious\r\nindifference and rampant scepticism, my faith in Judaism waned more and\r\nmore. I tried to make myself acquainted with Christianity, assayed to\r\nstudy the New Testament, but not with the hope of finding in it truth\r\nand peace. My studies were mostly of a critical nature. My Jewish\r\nprejudices, though largely toned down by frequent intercourse with\r\nChristians, were still potent enough to prevent an impartial\r\ninvestigation. The difficulties of the Gospels seemed to me insuperable.\r\nSo I continued to drift further and further away from religious\r\ninfluences, until at Amsterdam I found myself at a boarding house\r\nin the company of some earnest Christian young men. They were\r\nschoolmasters--intelligent, idealistic, eager to learn and to exchange\r\nthoughts with others, and before very long we were on friendly terms.\r\nThrough their intercourse, the almost extinguished interest for\r\nreligious thought once more revived in me. Not that we ever went in for\r\nregular theological discussions--mere politeness forbade that--but\r\nDante's 'Inferno,' Milton's 'Paradise Lost,' and other literary\r\nproductions with a religious basis, were often talked over among us, and\r\nI could not help being impressed by the true, though unobtrusive,\r\nreligious fervour of those educated young men.\r\n\r\n\"I decided to look for a person competent to deal with my prejudices and\r\nwilling to assist me to a spiritual understanding of Christianity. An\r\nEncyclopædia helped to the address of the London Society for Promoting\r\nChristianity amongst the Jews, and a letter from the Secretary\r\nintroduced me to the Society's missionary at Amsterdam, the Rev. A. C.\r\nAdler. I told that gentleman, on my first visit to him, that it was not\r\nso much the history of Christ and Christianity as the spiritual element\r\nof the New Testament that baffled me, and that I should feel obliged to\r\nhim for some light upon the subject. I did not pretend to any desire of\r\nembracing Christianity, nor did Mr. Adler, on his part, so much as hint\r\nat that eventuality. He most readily acceded to my request for\r\nenlightenment, and suggested that we should read together the Gospel of\r\nSt. John. For some seven weeks I had the little expected pleasure of\r\nlistening to a masterly exposition of a book that had been till then the\r\nleast intelligible one to me in the New Testament. I shall never forget\r\nthe impression Mr. Adler's intelligent interpretation of that Gospel\r\nproduced upon my mind and heart. I felt myself literally introduced into\r\na new world--into that spiritual world of which the carnal mind and the\r\nmaterialist know nothing. The person of Christ kept on growing before\r\nand within me until I could think of nothing else. But I was not to\r\nyield myself to Him without a struggle.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Adler, with an unerring tact, restricted himself conscientiously to\r\nthe task of instruction. He asked no questions, nor did he invite me to\r\na confession of faith. Had he done so, I fear he had but succeeded in\r\nrepelling me, at least for a time.\r\n\r\n\"When I found myself face to face with the question:--'What think you\r\n_now_ of Christ?'--pride of reason and lingering prejudice seemed to\r\nassert themselves more. I at once suddenly ceased visiting Mr. Adler and\r\nthought of getting Christianity out of my head entirely. I cannot tell\r\nwhether Mr. Adler still entertained the hope of ever seeing me again in\r\nhis study; I certainly intended that it should not be the case.\r\n\r\n\"The Lord Jesus, however, had become too strong for me to resist Him\r\nsuccessfully for any length of time. My peace of mind was clean gone,\r\nand I had, for my own part, experienced the truth of our Lord's words,\r\n'No man can come to Me, except the Father which hath sent Me, draw him.'\r\n\r\n\"After a time I was again at Mr. Adler's. When, in answer to my knock\r\nthere came his Dutch 'Binnen!' ('Come in!'), and I stepped into the\r\nroom, Mr. Adler came hurriedly up to meet me, and, taking both my hands,\r\nexclaimed joyfully, 'You have come again. Then all is right. I knew you\r\nwould not come unless your doubts were conquered. I have been praying\r\nfor that.'\r\n\r\n\"A few days after this episode I received a telegraphic message\r\nnecessitating my immediate return to Germany. I took at once a train to\r\nZandvoort, a seaside place near Amsterdam, where Mr. Adler was at the\r\ntime with his family for their summer holiday. I told him I had to leave\r\nHolland without delay and requested, as a special favour, that he would\r\nadmit me into the Church of Christ by baptism the very next day. Mr.\r\nAdler looked rather perplexed. He was, on principle, he told me, opposed\r\nto doing things in a hurry, and especially when baptism was under\r\nconsideration. But my case was so exceptional that he thought he saw in\r\nit the Lord's doing, and could not therefore refuse my request.\r\n\r\n\"The following morning, Sunday, August 12th, 1888, Mr. Adler was in the\r\npulpit of his church, after explaining the reason of his unexpected\r\nreturn to Amsterdam, he invited the congregation to be present at my\r\nbaptism that afternoon. Saintly old Mr. Bloch, late missionary of the\r\nL.J.S., and the beadle of the church, acted as witnesses to my public\r\ndeclaration of faith in Christ crucified.\r\n\r\n\"On the day following my baptism I had already left Holland, and was on\r\nmy way back to Koenigsberg. There I spent another three years, following\r\nmy commercial vocation and keeping up all along a pretty regular\r\ncorrespondence with Mr. Adler, to whose instruction I owed so much. In\r\nthose letters he frequently reminded me of my Christian duty toward my\r\nJewish brethren, and invited me to offer myself for missionary training.\r\nI doubted my qualifications for such a calling, questioned the\r\nadvisability of going back to college after an interval of ten years\r\nspent in commercial pursuits, but at last I decided to follow the call,\r\nand sent an application to London for admission into the London Jews'\r\nSociety's Missionary College. I was admitted there in December, 1891,\r\nand remained associated with the Institution for three years and a-half,\r\ntill July, 1895.\r\n\r\n\"Having completed the course of my studies, I was attached to the staff\r\nof the London Mission, thence I was transferred to work at Manchester in\r\n1896, and exactly three years later to Jerusalem. Here I was ordained\r\ndeacon at Christmas, 1900, and priest on Trinity Sunday, 1902, by the\r\nBishop of the Church of England in Jerusalem and the East, Dr. Blyth.\r\nHere also I was married to Miss Sara Jane Ellison, daughter of the late\r\nDean Ellison, of Shillelagh, County Wicklow, Ireland, April, 1901.\r\n\r\n\"I may be allowed to mention in conclusion that the decision to give up\r\nmy business prospects, in order to become a missionary to the Jews, was\r\nsoon amply rewarded by the Lord. My elder brother, with whom I had\r\nexchanged many letters on the subject of Christianity ever since I had\r\nembraced it myself, without apparently making much impression on him,\r\nwrote to me now--having heard of the step I had taken--to express his\r\nappreciation of what I had done. 'Whatsoever people may think of your\r\nmotives or your actions, there is probably no one that can put them down\r\nat their proper value better than myself,' ran his note. 'I have seen\r\nyou during the last ten years steadily climbing the ladder of commercial\r\nsuccess, gaining in experience and reputation, and about to earn the\r\nfruit of much labour, and then to throw it all deliberately over in\r\norder to become a missionary! I cannot help admiring you. You have done\r\nthe right and proper thing. Though we differ in our religious opinions,\r\nwe do not on the point of principle. You have acted as I should have\r\nexpected an honest man, with soul above £ s. d. to act. It is refreshing\r\nto find enthusiasm for ideal goods in our sordid age of materialism.'\r\n\r\n\"This brother of mine is now, I am grateful to say, himself a worker in\r\nthe Lord's vineyard, labouring with marked success as a medical\r\nmissionary amongst the Jews of New York, faithfully assisted by his\r\nwife--also a convert from Judaism.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1902 the Rev. L. and Mrs. Zeckhausen were transferred from Jerusalem\r\nto Cracow; and in 1908, on the death of his spiritual father, the Rev.\r\nA. C. Adler, he succeeded to the headship of the L.J.S. mission at\r\nAmsterdam and Rotterdam.\r\n\r\nZUCKERKANDLE, Dr., and his wife were converted and baptized in Pesth\r\nthrough the instrumentality of the Rev. William Wingate. He was\r\nafterwards a missionary of the L.J.S. in Bucharest, and later on he\r\nentered the service of the British Society for the Propagation of the\r\nGospel among the Jews and conducted a school at Rustschuk in Bulgaria,\r\nwhere he died in 1874. The widow came then to London, and laboured\r\namongst the Jewesses in Spitalfields for many years with great blessing\r\nupon her work of love. She was probably the first to organize a Jewish\r\nmothers' meeting.\r\n\r\nZUCKERTORT, G. J., father of the famous chessplayer, was won for Christ\r\nthrough the preaching of the L.J.S. missionary Wendt, and was baptized\r\nby him in 1831. In 1836 he was appointed assistant missionary at Lublin,\r\nwhere he preached the Gospel to his own relations, one of whom, a\r\nthriving medical doctor of the same name, confessed Christ and was\r\nbaptized with his four children in 1845, and his wife later, in 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nInconsistencies in spelling have been resolved in cases where it was\r\npossible to divine the author's intent with a reasonable degree of\r\ncertainty.
