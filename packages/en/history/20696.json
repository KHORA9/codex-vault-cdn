In the pages that follow my\r\naim has been to gather a Sussex bouquet rather than to present the facts\r\nwhich the more practical traveller requires.\r\n\r\nThe order of progress through the country has been determined largely by\r\nthe lines of railway. I have thought it best to enter Sussex in the west\r\nat Midhurst, making that the first centre, and to zig-zag thence across\r\nto the east by way of Chichester, Arundel, Petworth, Horsham, Brighton\r\n(I name only the chief centres), Cuckfield, East Grinstead, Lewes,\r\nEastbourne, Hailsham, Hastings, Rye, and Tunbridge Wells; leaving the\r\ncounty finally at Withyham, on the borders of Ashdown Forest. For the\r\ntraveller in a carriage or on a bicycle this route is not the best; but\r\nfor those who would explore it slowly on foot (and much of the more\r\ncharacteristic scenery of Sussex can be studied only in this way), with\r\noccasional assistance from the train, it is, I think, as good a scheme\r\nas any.\r\n\r\nI do not suggest that it is necessary for the reader who travels through\r\nSussex to take the same route: he would probably prefer to cover the\r\ncounty literally strip by strip--the Forest strip from Tunbridge Wells\r\nto Horsham, the Weald strip from Billingshurst to Burwash, the Downs\r\nstrip from Racton to Beachy Head--rather than follow my course, north to\r\nsouth, and south to north, across the land. But the book is, I think,\r\nthe gainer by these tangents, and certainly its author is happier, for\r\nthey bring him again and again back to the Downs.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible at this date to write about Sussex, in accordance with\r\nthe plan of the present series, without saying a great many things that\r\nothers have said before, and without making use of the historians of the\r\ncounty. To the collections of the Sussex Archæological Society I am\r\ngreatly indebted; also to Mr. J. G. Bishop's _Peep into the Past_, and\r\nto Mr. W. D. Parish's _Dictionary of the Sussex Dialect_. Many other\r\nworks are mentioned in the text.\r\n\r\nThe history, archæology, and natural history of the county have been\r\nthoroughly treated by various writers; but there are, I have noticed,\r\nfewer books than there should be upon Sussex men and women. Carlyle's\r\nsaying that every clergyman should write the history of his parish\r\n(which one might amend to the history of his parishioners) has borne too\r\nlittle fruit in our district; nor have lay observers arisen in any\r\nnumber to atone for the shortcoming. And yet Sussex must be as rich in\r\ngood character, pure, quaint, shrewd, humorous or noble, as any other\r\ndivision of England. In the matter of honouring illustrious Sussex men\r\nand women, the late Mark Antony Lower played his part with _The Worthies\r\nof Sussex_, and Mr. Fleet with _Glimpses of Our Sussex Ancestors_; but\r\nthe Sussex \"Characters,\" where are they? Who has set down their \"little\r\nunremembered acts,\" their eccentricities, their sterling southern\r\ntenacities? The Rev. A. D. Gordon wrote the history of Harting, and\r\nquite recently the Rev. C. N. Sutton has published his interesting\r\n_Historical Notes of Withyham, Hartfield, and Ashdown Forest_; and there\r\nmay be other similar parish histories which I am forgetting. But the\r\nonly books that I have seen which make a patient and sympathetic\r\nattempt to understand the people of Sussex are Mr. Parish's\r\n_Dictionary_, Mr. Egerton's _Sussex Folk and Sussex Ways_, and \"John\r\nHalsham's\" _Idlehurst_. How many rare qualities of head and heart must\r\ngo unrecorded in rural England.\r\n\r\nI have to thank my friend Mr. C. E. Clayton for his kindness in reading\r\nthe proofs of this book and in suggesting additions.\r\n\r\n                                                         E. V.

But if one's\r\nfirst impression of new country cannot be too favourable we have done\r\nrightly in starting at Midhurst, even at the risk of a loss of\r\nenthusiasm in the concluding chapters. For although historically,\r\nsocially, and architecturally north Sussex is as interesting as south\r\nSussex, the crown of the county's scenery is the Downs, and its most\r\nfascinating districts are those which the Downs dominate. The farther we\r\ntravel from the Downs and the sea the less unique are our surroundings.\r\nMany of the villages in the northern Weald, beautiful as they are, might\r\nequally well be in Kent or Surrey: a visitor suddenly alighting in their\r\nmidst, say from a balloon, would be puzzled to name the county he was\r\nin; but the Downs and their dependencies are essential Sussex. Hence a\r\nSussex man in love with the Downs becomes less happy at every step\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE INVIOLATE HILLS]\r\n\r\nOne cause of the unique character of the Sussex Downs is their virginal\r\nsecurity, their unassailable independence. They stand, a silent\r\nundiscovered country, between the seething pleasure towns of the\r\nseaboard plain and the trim estates of the Weald. Londoners, for whom\r\nSussex has a special attraction by reason of its proximity (Brighton's\r\nbeach is the nearest to the capital in point of time), either pause\r\nnorth of the Downs, or rush through them in trains, on bicycles, or in\r\ncarriages, to the sea. Houses there are among the Downs, it is true, but\r\nthey are old-established, the homes of families that can remember no\r\nother homes. There is as yet no fashion for residences in these\r\naltitudes. Until that fashion sets in (and may it be far distant) the\r\nDowns will remain essential Sussex, and those that love them will\r\nexclaim with Mr. Kipling,\r\n\r\n\r\n     God gave all men all earth to love,\r\n       But since man's heart is small,\r\n     Ordains for each one spot shall prove\r\n       Beloved over all.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Each to his choice, and I rejoice\r\n       The lot has fallen to me\r\n     In a fair ground--in a fair ground--\r\n       Yea, Sussex by the sea!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MIDHURST]\r\n\r\nIf we are to begin our travels in Sussex with the best, then Midhurst is\r\nthe starting point, for no other spot has so much to offer: a quiet\r\ncountry town, gabled and venerable, unmodernised and unambitious, with a\r\nriver, a Tudor ruin, a park of deer, heather commons, immense woods, and\r\nthe Downs only three miles distant. Moreover, Midhurst is also the\r\ncentre of a very useful little railway system, which, having only a\r\nsingle line in each direction, while serving the traveller, never annoys\r\nhim by disfiguring the country or letting loose upon it crowds of\r\nvandals. Single lines always mean thinly populated country. As a\r\npedestrian poet has sung:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     My heart leaps up when I behold\r\n       A single railway line;\r\n     For then I know the wood and wold\r\n       Are almost wholly mine.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Midhurst being on no great high road is nearly always quiet. Nothing\r\never hurries there. The people live their own lives, passing along their\r\nfew narrow streets and the one broad one, under the projecting eaves of\r\ntimbered houses, unrecking of London and the world. Sussex has no more\r\ncontented town.\r\n\r\nThe church, which belongs really to St. Mary Magdalen, but is popularly\r\ncredited to St. Denis, was never very interesting, but is less so now\r\nthat the Montagu tomb has been moved to Easebourne. Twenty years ago, I\r\nremember, an old house opposite the church was rumoured to harbour a\r\npig-faced lady. I never had sight of her, but as to her existence and\r\nher cast of feature no one was in the least doubt. Pig-faced ladies\r\n(once so common) seem to have gone out, just as the day of Spring-heeled\r\nJack is over. Sussex once had her Spring-heeled Jacks, too, in some\r\nprofusion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cowdray._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ELIZABETH AT COWDRAY]\r\n\r\nCowdray Park is gained from the High Street, just below the Angel Inn,\r\nby a causeway through water meadows of the Rother. The house is now but\r\na shell, never having been rebuilt since the fire which ate out its\r\nheart in 1793: yet a beautiful shell, heavily draped in rich green ivy\r\nthat before very long must here and there forget its earlier duty of\r\nsupporting the walls and thrust them too far from the perpendicular to\r\nstand. Cowdray, built in the reign of Henry VIII., did not come to its\r\nfull glory until Sir Anthony Browne, afterwards first Viscount Montagu,\r\ntook possession. The seal was put upon its fame by the visit of Queen\r\nElizabeth in 1591 (Edward VI. had been banqueted there by Sir Anthony in\r\n1552, \"marvellously, nay, rather excessively,\" as he wrote), as some\r\nreturn for the loyalty of her host, who, although an old man, in 1588,\r\non the approach of the Armada, had ridden straightway to Tilbury, with\r\nhis sons and his grandson, the first to lay the service of his house at\r\nher Majesty's feet. A rare pamphlet is still preserved describing the\r\nfestivities during Queen Elizabeth's sojourn. On Saturday, about eight\r\no'clock, her Majesty reached the house, travelling from Farnham, where\r\nshe had dined. Upon sight of her loud music sounded. It stopped when she\r\nset foot upon the bridge, and a real man, standing between two wooden\r\ndummies whom he exactly resembled, began to flatter her exceedingly.\r\nUntil she came, he said, the walls shook and the roof tottered, but one\r\nglance from her eyes had steadied the turret for ever. He went on to\r\ncall her virtue immortal and herself the Miracle of Time, Nature's\r\nGlory, Fortune's Empress, and the World's Wonder. Elizabeth, when he had\r\nmade an end, took the key from him and embraced Lady Montagu and her\r\ndaughter, the Lady Dormir; whereupon \"the mistress of the house (as it\r\nwere weeping in the bosome) said, 'O happie time! O joyfull daie!'\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A QUEEN'S DIVERSIONS]\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries over, the fun began. At breakfast next morning three\r\noxen and a hundred and forty geese were devoured. On Monday, August\r\n17th, Elizabeth rode to her bower in the park, took a crossbow from a\r\nnymph who sang a sweet song, and with it shot \"three or four\" deer,\r\ncarefully brought within range. After dinner, standing on one of the\r\nturrets she watched sixteen bucks \"pulled down with greyhounds\" in a\r\nlawn. On Tuesday, the Queen was approached by a pilgrim, who first\r\ncalled her \"Fairest of all creatures,\" and expressed the wish that the\r\nworld might end with her life and then led her to an oak whereon were\r\nhanging escutcheons of her Majesty and all the neighbouring noblemen and\r\ngentlemen. As she looked, a \"wilde man\" clad all in ivy appeared and\r\ndelivered an address on the importance of loyalty. On Wednesday, the\r\nQueen was taken to a goodlie fish-pond (now a meadow) where was an\r\nangler. After some words from him a band of fishermen approached,\r\ndrawing their nets after them; whereupon the angler, turning to her\r\nMajesty, remarked that her virtue made envy blush and stand amazed.\r\nHaving thus spoken, the net was drawn and found to be full of fish,\r\nwhich were laid at Elizabeth's feet. The entry for this day ends with\r\nthe sentence, \"That evening she hunted.\" On Thursday the lords and\r\nladies dined at a table forty-eight yards long, and there was a country\r\ndance with tabor and pipe, which drew from her Majesty \"gentle\r\napplause.\" On Friday, the Queen knighted six gentlemen and passed on to\r\nChichester.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A DESPERADO POET]\r\n\r\nA year later the first Lord Montagu died. He was succeeded by another\r\nAnthony, the author of the \"Book of Orders and Rules\" for the use of the\r\nfamily at Cowdray, and the dedicatee of Anthony Copley's _Fig for\r\nFortune_, 1596. Copley has a certain Sussex interest of his own, having\r\nastonished not a little the good people of Horsham. A contemporary\r\nletter describes him as \"the most desperate youth that liveth. He did\r\nshoot at a gentleman last summer, and did kill an ox with a musket, and\r\nin Horsham church he threw his dagger at the parish clerk, and it stuck\r\nin a seat of the church. There liveth not his like in England for sudden\r\nattempts.\" Subsequently the conspirator-poet must have calmed down, for\r\nhe states in the dedication to my lord that he is \"now winnowed by the\r\nfan of grace and Zionry.\" To-day he would say \"saved.\" Copley, after\r\nnarrowly escaping capital punishment for his share in a Jesuit plot,\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe instructions given in Lord Montagu's \"Booke of Orders and Rules\"\r\nillustrate very vividly the generous amplitude of the old Cowdray\r\nestablishment. Thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     MY CARVER AND HIS OFFICE.\r\n\r\n     I will that my carver, when he cometh to the ewerye boorde, doe\r\n     there washe together with the Sewer, and that done be armed\r\n     (videlt.) with an armeinge towell cast about his necke, and putt\r\n     under his girdle on both sides, and one napkyn on his lefte\r\n     shoulder, and an other on the same arme; and thence beinge broughte\r\n     by my Gentleman Usher to my table, with two curteseyes thereto, the\r\n     one about the middest of the chamber, the other when he cometh to\r\n     ytt, that he doe stande seemely and decently with due reverence and\r\n     sylence, untill my dyett and fare be brought uppe, and then doe his\r\n     office; and when any meate is to be broken uppe that he doe carrye\r\n     itt to a syde table, which shalbe prepared for that purpose and\r\n     there doe ytt; when he hath taken upp the table, and delivered the\r\n     voyder to the yeoman Usher, he shall doe reverence and returne to\r\n     the ewrye boorde there to be unarmed. My will is that for that day\r\n     he have the precedence and place next to my Gentleman Usher at the\r\n     wayter's table.\r\n\r\n\r\n     MY GENTLEMEN WAYTERS.\r\n\r\n     I will that some of my Gentlemen Wayters harken when I or my wiffe\r\n     att any tyme doe walke abroade, that they may be readye to give\r\n     their attendance uppon us, some att one tyme and some att another\r\n     as they shall agree amongst themselves; but when strangeres are in\r\n     place, then I will that in any sorte they be readye to doe such\r\n     service for them as the Gentleman Usher shall directe. I will\r\n     further that they be dayly presente in the greate chamber or other\r\n     place of my dyett about tenn of the clocke in the forenoone and\r\n     five in the afternoone without fayle for performance of my service,\r\n     unles they have license from my Stewarde or Gentleman Usher to the\r\n     contrarye, which if they exceede, I will that they make knowne the\r\n     cause thereof to my Stewarde, who shall acquaynte me therewithall.\r\n     I will that they dyne and suppe att a table appoynted for them, and\r\n     there take place nexte after the Gentlemen of my Horse and chamber,\r\n     accordinge to their seniorityes in my service.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE HOUSE OF MONTAGU]\r\n\r\nThe third Viscount Montagu was not remarkable, but his account books are\r\nquaint reading. From July, 1657, to July, 1658, his steward spent\r\n_£_1,945 10_s._ solely in little personal matters for his master. Among\r\nthe disbursements were, on September 11th, fourteen pence \"for washing\r\nWill Stapler\"; on November 22nd, 1_s._ 4_d._ to the Lewes carrier \"for\r\nbringing a box of puddings for my mistress and my master\"; on January\r\n17th, _£_4 to \"Mr. Fiske the dancing-master for teaching my master to\r\ndance, being two months\"; and on April 21st, seven shillings \"for a\r\nTooth for my Lord.\"\r\n\r\nThe fifth Viscount was a man of violent temper. On reaching Mass one day\r\nand finding it half done, he drew his pistol and shot the chaplain. The\r\noutcry all over the country was loud and vengeful, and my lord lay\r\nconcealed for fifteen years in a hiding-hole contrived in the masonry of\r\nCowdray for the shelter of persecuted priests. The peer emerged only at\r\nnight, when he roamed the close walks, repentant and sad. Lady Montagu\r\nwould then steal out to him, dressing all in white to such good purpose\r\nthat the desired rumours of a ghost soon flew about the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe curse of Cowdray, which, if genuinely pronounced, has certainly been\r\nwonderfully fulfilled, dates from the gift of Battle Abbey by Henry\r\nVIII. to Sir Anthony Browne, the father of Queen Elizabeth's host and\r\nfriend. Sir Anthony seized his new property, and turned the monks out\r\nof the gates, in 1538. Legend says that as the last monk departed, he\r\nwarned his despoiler that by fire and water his line should perish. By\r\nfire and water it perished indeed. A week after Cowdray House was\r\nburned, in 1793, the last Viscount Montagu was drowned in the Rhine. His\r\nonly sister (the wife of Mr. Stephen Poyntz) who inherited, was the\r\nmother of two sons both of whom were drowned while bathing at Bognor.\r\nWhen Mr. Poyntz sold the estate to the Earl of Egmont, we may suppose\r\nthe curse to have been withdrawn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DR. JOHNSON AT COWDRAY]\r\n\r\nAmong the treasures that were destroyed in the fire were the Roll of\r\nBattle Abbey and many paintings. Dr. Johnson visited Cowdray a few years\r\nbefore its demolition; \"Sir,\" he said to Boswell, \"I should like to stay\r\nhere four-and-twenty hours. We see here how our ancestors lived.\"\r\nAccording to the _Tour of Great Britain_, attributed to Daniel Defoe,\r\nbut probably by another hand, Cowdray's hall was of Irish oak. In the\r\nlarge parlour were the triumphs of Henry VIII. by Holbein. In the long\r\ngallery were the Twelve Apostles \"as large as life\"; while the marriage\r\nof Cupid and Psyche, a tableau that never failed to please our\r\nancestors, was not wanting.\r\n\r\nThe glory of the Montagus has utterly passed. The present Earl of Egmont\r\nis either an absentee or he lives in a cottage near the gates; and the\r\nnew house, which is hidden in trees, is of no interest. The park,\r\nhowever, is still ranged by its beautiful deer, and still possesses an\r\navenue of chestnut trees and rolling wastes of turf. It is everywhere as\r\nfree as a heath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMIDHURST'S VILLAGES\r\n\r\n     Hanging in chains--A wooded paradise--Fernhurst--Shulbrede\r\n     Priory--Blackdown--Tennyson's Sussex home--Thomas Otway--Kate\r\n     Hotspur's Grave--A Sussex ornithologist--The friend of\r\n     owls--William Cobbett looks at the Squire--The charms of South\r\n     Harting--Lady Mary Caryll's little difficulties--Gilbert White in\r\n     Sussex--The old field routine--Witchcraft at South Harting--The\r\n     Rother--Easebourne--West Lavington and Cardinal Manning.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe road from Midhurst to Blackdown ascends steadily to Henley,\r\nthreading vast woods and preserves. On the left is a great common, on\r\nthe right North Heath, where the two Drewitts were hanged in chains\r\nafter being executed at Horsham, in 1799, for the robbery of the\r\nPortsmouth mail--probably the last instance of hanging in chains in this\r\ncountry. For those that like wild forest country there was once no\r\nbetter ramble than might be enjoyed here; but now (1903) that the King's\r\nnew sanatorium is being built in the midst of Great Common, some of the\r\nwildness must necessarily be lost. A finer site could not have been\r\nfound. Above Great Common is a superb open space nearly six hundred feet\r\nhigh, with gorse bushes advantageously placed to give shelter while one\r\nstudies the Fernhurst valley, the Haslemere heights and, blue in the\r\ndistance, the North Downs. Sussex has nothing wilder or richer than the\r\ncountry we are now in.\r\n\r\nA few minutes' walk to the east from this lofty common, and we are\r\nimmediately above Henley, clinging to the hill side, an almost Alpine\r\nhamlet. Henley, however, no longer sees the travellers that once it did,\r\nfor the coach road, which of old climbed perilously through it, has been\r\ndiverted in a curve through the hanger, and now sweeps into Fernhurst by\r\nway of Henley Common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Blackdown._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FERNHURST]\r\n\r\nFernhurst, beautifully named, is in an exquisite situation among the\r\nminor eminences of the Haslemere range, but the builder has been busy\r\nhere, and the village is not what it was.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SHULBREDE PRIORY]\r\n\r\nTwo miles to the north-west, on the way to Linchmere, immediately under\r\nthe green heights of Marley, is the old house which once was Shulbrede\r\nPriory. As it is now in private occupation and is not shown to\r\nstrangers, I have not seen it; but of old many persons journeyed\r\nthither, attracted by the quaint mural paintings, in the Prior's room,\r\nof domestic animals uttering speech. \"Christus natus est,\" crows the\r\ncock. \"Quando? Quando?\" the duck inquires. \"In hac nocte,\" says the\r\nraven. \"Ubi? Ubi?\" asks the cow, and the lamb satisfies her: \"Bethlehem,\r\nBethlehem.\"\r\n\r\nOne may return deviously from Shulbrede to Midhurst (passing in the\r\nheart of an unpopulated country a hamlet called Milland, where is an old\r\ncuriosity shop of varied resources) by way of one of the pleasantest and\r\nnarrowest lanes that I know, rising and falling for miles through silent\r\nwoods, coming at last to Chithurst church, one of the smallest and\r\nsimplest and least accessible in the county, and reaching Midhurst again\r\nby the hard, dry and irreproachable road that runs between the heather\r\nof Trotton Common.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of Fernhurst, to which we may now return, a mile on\r\nthe way to Lurgashall, was once Verdley Castle; but it is now a castle\r\nno more, merely a ruined heap. Utilitarianism was too much for it, and\r\nits stones fell to Macadam. After all, if an old castle has to go, there\r\nare few better forms of reincarnation for it than a good hard road.\r\nWhile at Fernhurst it is well to walk on to Blackdown, the best way,\r\nperhaps, being to take the lane to the right about half a mile beyond\r\nthe village, and make for the hill across country. Blackdown, whose\r\nblackness is from its heather and its firs, frowns before one all the\r\nwhile. The climb to the summit is toilsome, over nine hundred feet, but\r\nwell worth the effort, for the hill overlooks hundreds of square miles\r\nof Sussex and Surrey, between Leith Hill in the north and Chanctonbury\r\nin the south.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TENNYSON'S SUSSEX HOME]\r\n\r\nAldworth, Tennyson's house, is on the north-east slope, facing Surrey.\r\nThe poet laid the foundation stone on April 23 (Shakespeare's birthday),\r\n1868: the inscription on the stone running \"Prosper thou the work of our\r\nhands, O prosper thou our handiwork.\" Of the site Aubrey de Vere\r\nwrote:--\"It lifted England's great poet to a height from which he could\r\ngaze on a large portion of that English land which he loved so well, see\r\nit basking in its most affluent summer beauty, and only bounded by 'the\r\ninviolate sea.' Year after year he trod its two stately terraces with\r\nmen the most noted of their time.\" Pilgrims from all parts journeyed\r\nthither--not too welcome; among them that devout American who had worked\r\nhis way across the Atlantic in order to recite _Maud_ to its author: a\r\nrecitation from which, says the present Lord Tennyson, his father\r\n\"suffered.\" Tennyson has, I think, no poems upon his Sussex home, but I\r\nalways imagine that the dedication of _The Death of Oenone and other\r\nPoems_, in 1894, must belong to Blackdown:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     There on the top of the down,\r\n     The wild heather round me and over me June's high blue,\r\n     When I look'd at the bracken so bright and the heather so brown,\r\n     I thought to myself I would offer this book to you,\r\n     This, and my love together,\r\n     To you that are seventy-seven,\r\n     With a faith as clear as the heights of the June-blue heaven,\r\n     And a fancy as summer-new\r\n     As the green of the bracken amid the gloom of the heather.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most interesting village between Midhurst and the western boundary,\r\ndue west, is Trotton, three miles distant on the superb road to\r\nPetersfield, of which I have spoken above. There is no better road in\r\nEngland. Trotton is quiet and modest, but it has two great claims on\r\nlovers of the English drama. In the \"Ode to Pity\" of one of our Sussex\r\npoets we read thus of another:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     But wherefore need I wander wide\r\n     To old Ilissus' distant side,\r\n       Deserted streams and mute?\r\n     Wild Arun, too, has heard thy strains,\r\n     And echo, 'midst my native plains,\r\n       Been soothed by pity's lute.\r\n\r\n     There first the wren thy myrtles shed\r\n     On gentlest Otway's infant head,\r\n       To him thy cell was shown;\r\n     And while he sung the female heart,\r\n     With youth's soft notes unspoiled by art,\r\n       Thy turtles mixed their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THOMAS OTWAY]\r\n\r\nSo wrote William Collins, adding in a note that the Arun (more properly\r\nthe Rother, a tributary of the Arun) runs by the village of Trotton, in\r\nSussex, where Thomas Otway had his birth. The unhappy author of _Venice\r\nPreserv'd_ and _The Orphan_ was born at Trotton in 1652, the son of\r\nHumphrey Otway, the curate, who afterwards became rector of Woolbeding\r\nclose by. Otway died miserably when only thirty-three, partly of\r\nstarvation, partly of a broken heart at the unresponsiveness of Mrs.\r\nBarry, the actress, whom he loved, but who preferred the Earl of\r\nRochester. His two best plays, although they are no longer acted, lived\r\nfor many years, providing in Belvidera, in _Venice Preserv'd_ and\r\nMonimia, in _The Orphan_ (in which he \"sung the female heart\") congenial\r\n_rôles_ for tragic actresses--Mrs. Barry, Mrs. Oldfield, Mrs. Cibber,\r\nMrs. Siddons and Miss O'Neill. Otway was buried in the churchyard of St.\r\nClement Danes, but a tablet to his fame is in Trotton church, which is\r\nof unusual plainness, not unlike an ecclesiastical barn. Here also is\r\nthe earliest known brass to a woman--Margaret de Camoys, who lived about\r\n1300.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOTSPUR'S LADY]\r\n\r\nThe transition is easy (at Trotton) from Otway to Shakespeare, from\r\n_Venice Preserv'd_ to _Henry IV._\r\n\r\n\r\n     HOTSPUR (to LADY PERCY). Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying\r\n     down: come quick, quick; that I may lay my head in thy lap.\r\n\r\n     _Lady P._ Go, ye giddy goose.              [_The music plays._\r\n\r\n     _Hot._ Now I perceive, the devil understands Welsh;\r\n            And 't is no marvel' he's so humorous,\r\n            By'r lady, he's a good musician.\r\n\r\n     _Lady P._ Then should you be nothing but musical; for you are\r\n     altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief, and hear the\r\n     lady sing in Welsh.\r\n\r\n     _Hot._ I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.\r\n\r\n     _Lady P._ Wouldst have thy head broken?\r\n\r\n     _Hot._ No.\r\n\r\n     _Lady P._ Then be still.\r\n\r\n     _Hot._ Neither: 'tis a woman's fault.\r\n\r\n     _Lady P._ Now God help thee!\r\n\r\n     _Hot._ To the Welsh lady's bed.\r\n\r\n     _Lady P._ What's that?\r\n\r\n     _Hot._ Peace! she sings.\r\n\r\n                                [_A Welsh song sung by_ LADY MORTIMER.\r\n\r\n     _Hot._ Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.\r\n\r\n     _Lady P._ Not mine, in good sooth.\r\n\r\n     _Hot._ Not yours, in good sooth! 'Heart, you swear like a\r\n     comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth'; and, 'As true as I\r\n     live'; and,\r\n\r\n            'As God shall mend me'; and, 'As sure as day':\r\n            And giv'st such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,\r\n            As if thou never walk'dst further than Finsbury.\r\n            Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,\r\n            A good mouth-filling oath; and leave 'in sooth,'\r\n            And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,\r\n            To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.\r\n            Come, sing.\r\n\r\n     _Lady P._ I will not sing.\r\n\r\n     _Hot._ 'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be redbreast teacher.\r\n     An the indentures be drawn, I'll away within these two hours; and\r\n     so come in when ye will.                                 [_Exit._\r\n\r\n\r\nMy excuse for introducing this little scene is that Kate, whose real\r\nname was Elizabeth, lies here. Her tomb is in the chancel, where she\r\nreposes beside her second husband Thomas, Lord Camoys, beneath a slab on\r\nwhich are presentments in brass of herself and her lord. It was this\r\nLord Camoys who rebuilt Trotton's church, about 1400, and who also gave\r\nthe village its beautiful bridge over the Rother at a cost, it used to\r\nbe said, of only a few pence less than that of the church.\r\n\r\nTrotton has still other literary claims. At Trotton Place lived Arthur\r\nEdward Knox, whose _Ornithological Rambles in Sussex_, published in\r\n1849, is one of the few books worthy to stand beside White's _Natural\r\nHistory of Selborne_. In Sussex, as elsewhere, the fowler has prevailed,\r\nand although rare birds are still occasionally to be seen, they now\r\nvisit the country only by accident, and leave it as soon as may be,\r\nthankful to have a whole skin. Guns were active enough in Knox's time,\r\nbut to read his book to-day is to be translated to a new land. From time\r\nto time I shall borrow from Mr. Knox's pages: here I may quote a short\r\npassage which refers at once to his home and to his attitude to those\r\ncreatures whom he loved to study and studied to love:--\"I have the\r\nsatisfaction of exercising the rites of hospitality towards a pair of\r\nbarn owls, which have for some time taken up their quarters in one of\r\nthe attic roofs of the ancient, ivy-covered house in which I reside. I\r\ndelight in listening to the prolonged snoring of the young when I ascend\r\nthe old oak stairs to the neighbourhood of their nursery, and in hearing\r\nthe shriek of the parent birds on the calm summer nights as they pass to\r\nand fro near my window; for it assures me that they are still safe; and\r\nas I know that at least a qualified protection is afforded them\r\nelsewhere, and that even their arch-enemy the gamekeeper is beginning\r\nreluctantly, but gradually, to acquiesce in the general belief of their\r\ninnocence and utility, I cannot help indulging the hope that this bird\r\nwill eventually meet with that general encouragement and protection to\r\nwhich its eminent services so richly entitle it.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COBBETT LOOKS AT THE SQUIRE]\r\n\r\nOne more literary association: it was at Trotton that William Cobbett\r\nlooked at the squire. \"From Rogate we came on to Trotton, where a Mr.\r\nTwyford is the squire, and where there is a very fine and ancient church\r\nclose by the squire's house. I saw the squire looking at some poor\r\ndevils who were making 'wauste improvements, ma'am,' on the road which\r\npasses by the squire's door. He looked uncommonly hard at me. It was a\r\nscrutinising sort of look, mixed, as I thought, with a little surprise,\r\nif not of jealousy, as much as to say, 'I wonder who the devil you can\r\nbe?' My look at the squire was with the head a little on one side, and\r\nwith the cheek drawn up from the left corner of the mouth, expressive of\r\nanything rather than a sense of inferiority to the squire, of whom,\r\nhowever, I had never heard speak before.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HARTING'S RICHES]\r\n\r\nBy passing on to Rogate, whose fine church not long since was restored\r\ntoo freely, and turning due south, we come to what is perhaps the most\r\nsatisfying village in all Sussex--South Harting. Cool and spacious and\r\nretired, it lies under the Downs, with a little subsidiary range of its\r\nown to shelter it also from the west. Three inns are ready to refresh\r\nthe traveller--the Ship, the White Hart (a favourite Sussex sign), and\r\nthe Coach and Horses (with a new signboard of dazzling freshness); the\r\nsurrounding country is good; Petersfield and Midhurst are less than an\r\nhour's drive distant; while the village has one of the most charming\r\nchurches in Sussex, both without and within. Unlike most of the county's\r\nspires, South Harting's is slate and red shingle, but the slate is of an\r\nagreeable green hue, resembling old copper. (Perhaps it is copper.) The\r\nroof is of red tiles mellowed by weather, and the south side of the\r\ntower is tiled too, imparting an unusual suggestion of warmth--more, of\r\ncomfort--to the structure; while on the east wall of the chancel is a\r\nVirginian creeper, which, as autumn advances, emphasises this effect.\r\nWithin, the church is winning, too, with its ample arches, perfect\r\nproportions, and that æsthetic satisfaction that often attends the\r\ncruciform shape. An interesting monument of the Cowper and Coles\r\nfamilies is preserved in the south transept--three full-size coloured\r\nfigures. In the north transept is a spiral staircase leading to the\r\ntower, and elsewhere are memorials of the Fords and Featherstonhaughs of\r\nUp-Park, a superb domain over the brow of Harting's Down, and of the\r\nCarylls of Lady Holt, of whom we shall see more directly. The east\r\nwindow is a peculiarly cheerful one, and the door of South Harting\r\nchurch is kept open, as every church door should be, but as too many in\r\nSussex are not.\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard, beneath a shed, are the remains of two tombs, with\r\nrecumbent stone figures, now in a fragmentary state. At the church gates\r\nare the old village stocks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MRS. JONES' MULYGRUBES]\r\n\r\nHarting has a place in literature, for one of the Carylls was Pope's\r\nfriend, John (1666-1736), a nephew of the diplomatist and dramatist.\r\nPope's Caryll, who suggested _The Rape of the Lock_, lived at Lady Holt\r\nat West Harting (long destroyed) and also at West Grinstead, where, as\r\nwe shall see, the poem was largely written. Mr. H. D. Gordon, rector of\r\nHarting for many years, wrote a history of his parish in 1877: a very\r\ninteresting, gossipy book; where we may read much of the Caryll family,\r\nincluding passages from their letters--how Lady Mary Caryll had the kind\r\nimpulse to take one of the parson's nine daughters to France to educate\r\nand befriend, but was so thoughtless as to transform into a pretty\r\nPapist; how Lady Mary disliked Mrs. Jones, the steward's wife; and many\r\nother matters. I quote a passage from a letter of Lady Mary's about Mrs.\r\nJones, showing that human nature was not then greatly different from\r\nwhat it is to-day:--\"Mr. Joans and his fine Madam came down two days\r\nbefore your birthday and expected to lye in the house, but as I\r\napprehended the consequence of letting them begin so, I made an excuse\r\nfor want of roome by expecting company, and sent them to Gould's [Arthur\r\nGould married Kate Caryll, and lived at Harting Place], where they\r\nstayed two nights. I invited them the next day to dinner and they came,\r\nbut the day following Madam huff'd (I believe), for she went away to\r\nBarnard's, and wou'd not so much as see the desert [dessert]; however, I\r\ndon't repent it, he has been here at all the merryment, and I believe\r\nyou'll find it better to keep them at a civil distance than other ways,\r\nfor she seems a high dame and not very good humoured, for she has been\r\nsick ever since of the mulygrubes.\" Mrs. Jones soon afterwards succumbed\r\neither to the mulygrubes or a worse visitation. Lady Mary thus broke the\r\nnews:--\"Mr. Jones's wife dyed on Sunday, just as she lived, an\r\nIndependent, and wou'd have no parson with her, because she sayd she\r\ncou'd pray as well as they. He is making a great funerall, but I believe\r\nnot in much affection, for he was all night at a merry bout two days\r\nbefore she died.\"\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the young Squire Caryll at Lady Holt with his bride,\r\nin 1739, Paul Kelly, the bailiff, informed Lady Mary that the villagers\r\nconducted their lord and lady home \"with the upermost satisfaction\"--a\r\ngood phrase.\r\n\r\nMr. Gordon writes elsewhere in his book of a famous writer whom\r\nHampshire claims: \"For at least forty years (1754-1792) Gilbert White\r\nwas an East Harting squire. The bulk of his property was at Woodhouse\r\nand Nye woods, on the northern slope of East Harting, and bounded on the\r\nwest by the road to Harting station. The passenger from Harting to the\r\nrailway has on his right, immediately opposite the 'Severals' wood,\r\nGilbert White's Farm, extending nearly to the station. White had also\r\nother Harting lands. These were upon the Downs, viz.:--a portion of the\r\nPark of Uppark on the south side, and a portion of Kildevil Lane, on the\r\nNorth Marden side of Harting Hill. Gilbert White was on his mother's\r\nside a Ford, and these lands had been transmitted to him through his\r\ngreat uncle, Oliver Whitby, nephew to Sir Edward Ford.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE OLD FIELD ROUTINE]\r\n\r\nA glimpse of the old Sussex field routine, not greatly changed in the\r\nremote districts to-day, was given to Mr. Gordon thirty years ago by an\r\naged labourer. This was the day:--\"Out in morning at four o'clock.\r\nMouthful of bread and cheese and pint of ale. Then off to the harvest\r\nfield. Rippin and moen [reaping and mowing] till eight. Then morning\r\nbrakfast and small beer. Brakfast--a piece of fat pork as thick as your\r\nhat [a broad-brimmed wideawake] is wide. Then work till ten o'clock:\r\nthen a mouthful of bread and cheese and a pint of strong beer\r\n['farnooner,' _i.e._, forenooner; 'farnooner's-lunch,' we called it].\r\nWork till twelve. Then at dinner in the farm-house; sometimes a leg of\r\nmutton, sometimes a piece of ham and plum pudding. Then work till five,\r\nthen a _nunch_ and a quart of ale. Nunch was cheese, 'twas skimmed\r\ncheese though. Then work till sunset, then home and have supper and a\r\npint of ale. I never knew a man drunk in the harvest field in my life.\r\nCould drink six quarts, and believe that a man might drink two gallons\r\nin a day. All of us were in the house [_i.e._, the usual hired servants,\r\nand those specially engaged for the harvest]: the yearly servants used\r\nto go with the monthly ones.\r\n\r\n\"There were two thrashers, and the head thrasher used always to go\r\nbefore the reapers. A man could cut according to the goodness of the\r\njob, half-an-acre a day. The terms of wages were _£_3 10_s._ to 50_s._\r\nfor the month.\r\n\r\n\"When the hay was in cock or the wheat in shock, then the Titheman come;\r\nyou didn't dare take up a field without you let him know. If the\r\nTitheman didn't come at the time, you tithed yourself. He marked his\r\nsheaves with a bough or bush. You couldn't get over the Titheman. If you\r\nbegan at a hedge and made the tenth cock smaller than the rest, the\r\nTitheman might begin in the middle just where he liked. The Titheman at\r\nHarting, old John Blackmore, lived at Mundy's [South Harting Street].\r\nHis grandson is blacksmith at Harting now. All the tithing was quiet.\r\nYou didn't dare even set your eggs till the Titheman had been and ta'en\r\nhis tithe. The usual day's work was from 7 to 5.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A SUSSEX WITCH]\r\n\r\nLike all Sussex villages, Harting has had its witches and possessors of\r\nthe evil eye. Most curious of these was old Mother Digby (_née_ Mollen),\r\nwho, in Mr. Gordon's words, lived at a house in Hog's Lane, East\r\nHarting, and had the power of witching herself into a hare, and was\r\ncontinually, like Hecate, attended by dogs. Squire Russell, of Tye Oak,\r\nalways lost his hare at the sink-hole of a drain near by the old lady's\r\nhouse. One day the dogs caught hold of the hare by its hind quarters,\r\nbut it escaped down the drain, and Squire Russell, instantly opening the\r\nold beldame's door, found her rubbing the part of her body corresponding\r\nto that by which the hound had seized the hare. Squire Caryll, however,\r\ndeclined to be hard on the broomstick and its riders, as the following\r\nentry in the records of the Court Leet, held for the Hundred of Dumford\r\nin 1747, shows:--\"Also we present the Honble. John Caryll, Esq., Lord of\r\nthis Mannor, for not having and keeping a Ducking Stool within the said\r\nHundred of Dumford according to law, for the ducking of scolds and other\r\ndisorderly persons.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE BEACON FIRES]\r\n\r\nThe road from South Harting to Elsted runs under the hills, which here\r\nrise abruptly from the fields, to great heights, notably Beacon Hill,\r\nlike a huge green mammoth, 800 feet high, on which, before the days of\r\ntelegraphy, lived the signaller, who passed on the tidings of danger on\r\nthe coast to the next beacon hill, above Henley, and so on to London. In\r\nthe days of Napoleon, when any moment might reveal the French fleet, the\r\nSussex hill tops must often have smouldered under false alarms. The next\r\nhill in the east is Treyford Hill, above Treyford village, whose church\r\ntower, standing on a little hill of its own nearly three hundred feet\r\nhigh, might take a lesson in beauty from South Harting's, although its\r\nspire has a slenderness not to be improved. Next to Treyford Hill is\r\nDidling Hill, above Didling, and then Linch Down, highest of all in\r\nthese parts, being 818 feet.\r\n\r\nElsted, which has no particular interest, possesses an inn, the Three\r\nHorse Shoes, on a site superior to that of many a nobleman's house. It\r\nstands high above a rocky lane, commanding a superb sidelong view of the\r\nDowns and the Weald.\r\n\r\nMidhurst's river is the Rother (not to be confounded with the Rother in\r\nthe east of Sussex), which flows into the Arun near Hardham. It is wide\r\nenough at Midhurst for small boats, and is a very graceful stream on\r\nwhich to idle and watch the few kingfishers that man has spared. One may\r\nwalk by its side for miles and hear no sound save the music of\r\nrepose--the soft munching of the cows in the meadows, the chuckle of the\r\nwater as a rat slips in, the sudden yet soothing plash caused by a\r\njumping fish. Around one's head in the evening the stag-beetle buzzes\r\nwith its multiplicity of wings and fierce lobster-like claws\r\nout-stretched.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Rother to the west one comes first to Easebourne, a shady\r\ncool village only a few steps from Midhurst, once notable for its\r\nBenedictine Priory of nuns. Henry VIII. put an end to its religious\r\nlife, which, however, if we may believe the rather disgraceful\r\nrevelations divulged at an episcopal examination, for some years had not\r\nbeen of too sincere a character. In Easebourne church is the handsome\r\ntomb of the first Viscount Montagu (the host of Queen Elizabeth), which\r\nwas brought hither from Midhurst church some forty years ago. Beyond\r\nEasebourne, on the banks of the Rother, is Woolbeding, amid lush grass\r\nand foliage, as green a spot as any in green England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MR. LA THANGUE'S HOME]\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the town (with a diversion into Queen Elizabeth's\r\nsombre wood-walk) one may come by the side of the river part of the way\r\nto West Lavington, which stands high on a slope facing the Downs, with\r\npine woods immediately beneath it, perhaps as fair a site as any church\r\ncan claim. The grave of Richard Cobden, the Free Trader, a native of\r\nHeyshott, near by, is in the churchyard. Here, in 1850, Henry Edward\r\nManning, afterwards Cardinal, preached his last sermon for the Church of\r\nEngland. It is, indeed, Manning country, for besides being curate and\r\nrector of Woollavington with Graffham (four or five miles to the\r\nsouth-east) from 1833 until his secession, he was for nine years\r\nArchdeacon of Chichester; he married Miss Sargent, daughter of the late\r\nrector and sister of Mrs. Samuel Wilberforce of Woollavington; and while\r\nrector, he rebuilt both churches. Graffham is interesting also as being\r\nthe present home of one of the most truthful of living painters, Mr.\r\nHenry La Thangue, whose scenes of peasants at work (in the manner of\r\nBarbizon) and studies of sunlight spattering through the trees are among\r\nthe triumphs of modern English art.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CIDER'S DISAPPEARANCE]\r\n\r\nOne more village and we will make for the hills. A mile beyond the\r\neastern gate of Cowdray Park is Lodsworth, still a paradise of apple\r\norchards, but no longer famous for its cider as once it was. Arthur\r\nYoung had the pleasure of tasting some Lodsworth cider of a superior\r\nquality at Lord Egremont's table at the beginning of the last century,\r\nbut I doubt if Petworth House honours the beverage to-day. Cider, except\r\nin the cider country, becomes less and less common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cowdray._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFIRST SIGHT OF THE DOWNS\r\n\r\n     The Sussex hills--Gilbert White's praise--Britons, Romans,\r\n     Saxons--Charles the Second's ride through Sussex.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween Midhurst and Chichester, our next centre, rise the Downs, to a\r\nheight of between seven hundred and eight hundred feet. Although we\r\nshall often be crossing them again before we leave the county, I should\r\nlike to speak of them a little in this place.\r\n\r\nThe Downs are the symbol of Sussex. The sea, the Weald, the heather\r\nhills of her great forest district, she shares with other counties, but\r\nthe Downs are her own. Wiltshire, Berkshire, Kent and Hampshire, it is\r\ntrue, have also their turf-covered chalk hills, but the Sussex Downs are\r\nvaster, more remarkable, and more beautiful than these, with more\r\nindividuality and charm. At first they have been known to disappoint the\r\ntraveller, but one has only to live among them or near them, within the\r\ninfluence of their varying moods, and they surely conquer. They are the\r\nsmoothest things in England, gigantic, rotund, easy; the eye rests upon\r\ntheir gentle contours and is at peace. They have no sublimity, no\r\ngrandeur, only the most spacious repose. Perhaps it is due to this\r\nquality that the Wealden folk, accustomed to be overshadowed by this\r\nunruffled range, are so deliberate in their mental processes and so\r\naverse from speculation or experiment. There is a hypnotism of form: a\r\nrugged peak will alarm the mind where a billowy green undulation will\r\nlull it. The Downs change their complexion, but are never other than\r\nsoothing and still: no stress of weather produces in them any of that\r\nsense of fatality that one is conscious of in Westmoreland.\r\nThunder-clouds empurple the turf and blacken the hangers, but they\r\ncannot break the imperturbable equanimity of the line; rain throws over\r\nthe range a gauze veil of added softness; a mist makes them more\r\nwonderful, unreal, romantic; snow brings them to one's doors. At sunrise\r\nthey are magical, a background for Malory; at sunset they are the lovely\r\nhome of the serenest thoughts, a spectacle for Marcus Aurelius. Their\r\ncombes, or hollows, are then filled with purple shadow cast by the\r\nsinking sun, while the summits and shoulders are gold.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GILBERT WHITE IN SUSSEX]\r\n\r\nGilbert White has an often-quoted passage on these hills:--\"Though I\r\nhave now travelled the Sussex downs upwards of thirty years, yet I still\r\ninvestigate that chain of majestic mountains with fresh admiration year\r\nby year, and I think I see new beauties every time I traverse it. This\r\nrange, which runs from Chichester eastward as far as East Bourn, is\r\nabout sixty miles in length, and is called the South Downs, properly\r\nspeaking, only round Lewes. As you pass along you command a noble view\r\nof the wild, or weald, on one hand, and the broad downs and sea on the\r\nother. Mr. Ray used to visit a family [Mr. Courthope, of Danny] just at\r\nthe foot of these hills, and was so ravished with the prospect from\r\nPlumpton Plain, near Lewes, that he mentions those scapes in his _Wisdom\r\nof God in the Works of the Creation_ with the utmost satisfaction, and\r\nthinks them equal to anything he had seen in the finest parts of Europe.\r\nFor my own part, I think there is somewhat peculiarly sweet and amusing\r\nin the shapely-figured aspect of the chalk hills in preference to those\r\nof stone, which are rugged, broken, abrupt, and shapeless. Perhaps I may\r\nbe singular in my opinion, and not so happy as to convey to you the same\r\nidea; but I never contemplate these mountains without thinking I\r\nperceive somewhat analogous to growth in their gentle swellings and\r\nsmooth fungus-like protuberances, their fluted sides, and regular\r\nhollows and slopes, that carry at once the air of vegetative dilatation\r\nand expansion:--Or, was there even a time when these immense masses of\r\ncalcareous matter were thrown into fermentation by some adventitious\r\nmoisture, were raised and leavened into such shapes by some plastic\r\npower; and so made to swell and heave their broad backs into the sky, so\r\nmuch above the less animated clay of the wild below?\"\r\n\r\nThe Downs have a human and historic as well as scenic interest. On many\r\nof their highest points are the barrows or graves of our British\r\nancestors, who, could they revisit the glimpses of the moon, would find\r\nlittle change, for these hills have been less interfered with than any\r\ndistrict within twice the distance from London. The English dislike of\r\nclimbing has saved them. They will probably be the last stronghold of\r\nthe horse when petrol has ousted him from every other region.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROMAN AND SAXON]\r\n\r\nAfter the Briton came the Roman, to whose orderly military mind such a\r\nchain of hills seemed a series of heaven-sent earthworks. Every point in\r\na favourable position was at once fortified by the legionaries. Standing\r\nupon these ramparts to-day, identical in general configuration in spite\r\nof the intervening centuries, one may imagine one's self a Cæsarian\r\nsoldier and see in fancy the hinds below running for safety.\r\n\r\nAfter the Romans came the Saxons, who did not, however, use the heights\r\nas their predecessors had. Yet they left even more intimate traces, for,\r\nas I shall show in a later chapter on Sussex dialect, the language of\r\nthe Sussex labourer is still largely theirs, the farms themselves often\r\nfollow their original Saxon disposition, the field names are unaltered,\r\nand the character of the people is of the yellow-haired parent stock.\r\nSussex, in many respects, is still Saxon. In a poem by Mr. W. G. Hole is\r\na stanza which no one that knows Sussex can read without visualising\r\ninstantly a Sussex hill-side farm:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Saxon lies, too, in his grave where the plough-lands swell;\r\n         And he feels with the joy that is Earth's\r\n         The Spring with its myriad births;\r\n         And he scents as the evening falls\r\n         The rich deep breath of the stalls;\r\n     And he says, \"Still the seasons bring increase and joy to the\r\n              world--It is well!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ESCAPE OF CHARLES II.]\r\n\r\nStanding on one of these hills above the Hartings one may remember an\r\nevent in English history of more recent date than any of the periods\r\nthat we have been recalling--the escape of Charles II in 1651. It was\r\nover these Downs that he passed; and it has been suggested that a\r\ntraveller wishing for a picturesque route across the Downs might do well\r\nto follow his course.\r\n\r\nAccording to the best accounts Charles was met, on the evening of\r\nOctober 13, near Hambledon, in Hampshire (afterwards to be famous as the\r\ncradle of first-class cricket), by Thomas and George Gunter of Racton,\r\nwith a leash of greyhounds as if for coursing. The King slept at the\r\nhouse of Thomas Symonds, Gunter's brother-in-law, in the character of a\r\nRoundhead. The next morning at daybreak, the King, Lord Wilmot and the\r\ntwo Gunters crossed Broad Halfpenny Down (celebrated by Nyren), and\r\nproceeding by way of Catherington Down, Charlton Down, and Ibsworth\r\nDown, reached Compting Down in Sussex. At Stanstead House Thomas Gunter\r\nleft the King, and hurried on to Brighton to arrange for the crossing to\r\nFrance. The others rode on by way of the hills, with a descent from\r\nDuncton Beacon, until they reached what promised to be the security of\r\nHoughton Forest. There they were panic-stricken nearly to meet Captain\r\nMorley, governor of Arundel Castle, and therefore by no means a King's\r\nman. The King, on being told who it was, replied merrily, \"I did not\r\nmuch like his starched mouchates.\" This peril avoided, they descended to\r\nHoughton village, where the Arun was crossed, and so to Amberley, where\r\nin Sir John Briscoe's castle the King slept.[1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROUNDHEADS OUTWITTED]\r\n\r\nOn Amberley Mount the King's horse cast a shoe, necessitating a drop to\r\none of the Burphams, at Lee Farm, to have the mishap put right.\r\nAscending the hills again the fugitives held the high track as far as\r\nSteyning. At Bramber they survived a second meeting with Cromwellians,\r\nthree or four soldiers of Col. Herbert Morley of Glynde suddenly\r\nappearing, but being satisfied merely to insult them. At Beeding, George\r\nGunter rode on by way of the lower road to Brighton, while the King and\r\nLord Wilmot climbed the hill at Horton, crossing by way of White Lot to\r\nSouthwick, where, according to one story, in a cottage at the west of\r\nthe Green was a hiding-hole in which the King lay until Captain Nicholas\r\nTattersall of Brighton was ready to embark him for Fécamp. George\r\nGunter's own story is, however, that the King rode direct to Brighton.\r\nHe reached Fécamp on October 16. Two hours after Gunter left Brighton,\r\n\"soldiers came thither to search for a tall black man, six feet four\r\ninches high\"--to wit, the Merry Monarch.\r\n\r\nSuch is the bare narrative of Charles' Sussex ride. If the reader would\r\nhave it garnished and spiced he should turn to the pages of Ainsworth's\r\n_Ovingdean Grange_, where much that never happened is set forth as\r\nentertainingly (or so I thought when I read it as a boy) as if it were\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] That is the story as the Amberley people like to have it, but\r\nanother version makes him ride from Hambledon to Brighton in one day; in\r\nwhich case he may have avoided Amberley altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCHICHESTER\r\n\r\n     William Collins--The Smiths of Chichester--Hardham's snuff--C. R.\r\n     Leslie's reminiscence--The headless Ravenswood--Chichester\r\n     Cathedral--Roman Chichester--Mr. Spershott's recollections--A\r\n     warning to swearers--The prettiest alms-house in England.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already quoted some lines by Collins on Otway; it is time to come\r\nto Collins himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n     When Music, heavenly maid, was young,\r\n     While yet in early Greece she sung,\r\n     The Passions oft, to hear her shell,\r\n     Throng'd around her magic cell--\r\n\r\n\r\nThe perfect ode which opens with these unforgettable lines belongs to\r\nChichester, for William Collins was born there on Christmas Day, 1721,\r\nand educated there, at the Prebendal school, until he went to\r\nWinchester. William Collins was the son of the Mayor of Chichester, a\r\nhatter, from whom Pope's friend Caryll bought his hats. I have no wish\r\nto tell here the sad story of Collins' life; it is better to remember\r\nthat few as are his odes they are all of gold. He died at Chichester in\r\n1759, and was buried in St. Andrew's Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n       With eyes up-raised, as one inspired,\r\n       Pale Melancholy sat retired;\r\n       And, from her wild sequester'd seat,\r\n       In notes by distance made more sweet,\r\n     Pour'd through the mellow horn her pensive soul:\r\n       And, dashing soft from rocks around\r\n       Bubbling runnels join'd the sound;\r\n     Through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole,\r\n       Or, o'er some haunted stream, with fond delay,\r\n         Round an holy calm diffusing,\r\n         Love of peace, and lonely musing,\r\n      In hollow murmurs died away.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GEORGE SMITH'S ECLOGUE]\r\n\r\nCollins is Chichester's great poet. She had a very agreeable minor poet,\r\ntoo, in George Smith, one of the Three Smiths--all artists: William,\r\nborn in 1707, painter of portraits and of fruit and flower pieces, and\r\nGeorge and John, born in 1713 and 1717, who painted landscapes,--known\r\ncollectively as the Smiths of Chichester. I mention them rather on\r\naccount of George Smith's poetical experiments than for the brothers'\r\nfame as artists; but there is such a pleasant flavour in one at least of\r\nhis _Pastorals_ that I have copied a portion of it. It is called \"The\r\nCountry Lovers; or, Isaac and Marget going to Town on a Summer's\r\nMorning.\" The town is probably Chichester--certainly one in Sussex and\r\nnear the Downs. Isaac speaks first:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Come! Marget, come!--the team is at the gate!\r\n     Not ready yet!--you always make me wait!\r\n\r\n\r\nI omit a certain amount of the dialogue which follows, but at last\r\nMarget exclaims:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Well, now I'm ready, long I have not staid.\r\n\r\n     ISAAC.\r\n\r\n     One kiss before we go, my pretty maid.\r\n\r\n     MARGET.\r\n\r\n     Go! don't be foolish, Isaac--get away!\r\n     Who loiters now?--I thought I could not stay!\r\n     There!--that's enough! why, Isaac, sure you're mad!\r\n\r\n     ISAAC.\r\n\r\n     One more, my dearest girl--\r\n\r\n     MARGET.\r\n\r\n     Be quiet, lad.\r\n     See both my cap and hair are rumpled o'er!\r\n     The tying of my beads is got before!\r\n\r\n     ISAAC.\r\n\r\n     There let it stay, thy brighter blush to show,\r\n     Which shames the cherry-colour'd silken bow.\r\n     Thy lips, which seem the scarlet's hue to steal,\r\n     Are sweeter than the candy'd lemon peel.\r\n\r\n     MARGET.\r\n\r\n     Pray take these chickens for me to the cart;\r\n     Dear little creatures, how it grieves my heart\r\n     To see them ty'd, that never knew a crime,\r\n     And formed so fine a flock at feeding time!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pretty poem ends with fervid protestations of devotion from Isaac:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     For thee the press with apple-juice shall foam!\r\n     For thee the bees shall quit their honey-comb!\r\n     For thee the elder's purple fruit shall grow!\r\n     For thee the pails with cream shall overflow!\r\n\r\n        But see yon teams returning from the town,\r\n     Wind in the chalky wheel-ruts o'er the down:\r\n     We now must haste; for if we longer stay,\r\n     They'll meet us ere we leave the narrow way.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother of Chichester's illustrious sons is Archbishop Juxon, who stood\r\nby the side of Charles I. on the scaffold and bade farewell to him in\r\nthe words \"You are exchanging from a temporal to an eternal crown--a\r\ngood exchange.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HARDHAM'S SNUFF]\r\n\r\nYet another, of a very different type, is John Hardham. \"When they\r\ntalked of their Raphaels, Correggios, and stuff,\" wrote Goldsmith of Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds,\r\n\r\n\r\n     He shifted his trumpet, and only took snuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad it not been for Chichester the great painter might never have had\r\nthe second of these consolations, for the only snuff he liked was\r\nHardham's No. 37, and Hardham was a native of Chichester. Before he\r\nbecame famous as a tobacconist, Hardham was, by night, a numberer of the\r\npit for Garrick at Drury Lane. One day he happened to blend Dutch and\r\nrappee and poured the mixture into a drawer labelled 37. Garrick so\r\nliked the pinch of it which he chanced upon, that he introduced a\r\nreference to its merits in some of his comic parts, with the result that\r\nHardham's little shop in Fleet Street soon became a resort, and no nose\r\nwas properly furnished without No. 37. As Colton wrote, in his\r\n_Hypocrisy_:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     A name is all. From Garrick's breath a puff\r\n     Of praise gave immortality to snuff;\r\n     Since which each connoisseur a transient heaven\r\n     Finds in each pinch of Hardham's 37.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wealth that came to the tobacconist he left to the city of\r\nChichester to relieve it of certain of its poor rates; and the citizens\r\nstill magnify Hardham's name. He died in 1772 and had the good sense to\r\nrestrict the expense of his funeral to ten pounds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WILKIE'S BUMPS]\r\n\r\nChichester was the scene of a pleasant incident recorded by Leslie in\r\nhis _Autobiographical Recollections_. He was staying with Wilkie at\r\nPetworth, the guest of their patron, and the patron of so many other\r\npainters, Lord Egremont, of whom we shall learn more when Petworth is\r\nreached. They all drove over to Chichester after a visit to Goodwood.\r\nLord Egremont, says Leslie, \"had some business to transact at\r\nChichester; but one of his objects was to show us a young girl, the\r\ndaughter of an upholsterer, who was devoted to painting, and considered\r\nto be a genius by her friends. She was not at home; but her mother said\r\nshe could soon be found, 'if his lordship would have the goodness to\r\nwait a short time.' The young lady soon appeared, breathless and\r\nexhausted with running. Lord Egremont mentioned our names, and she said,\r\nlooking up to Wilkie with an expression of great respect, 'Oh, sir! it\r\nwas but yesterday I had your head in my hands.' This puzzled him, as he\r\ndid not know she was a phrenologist.\r\n\r\n\"'And what bumps did you find?' said Lord Egremont.\r\n\r\n\"'The organ of veneration, very large,' was her answer; and Wilkie,\r\nmaking her a profound bow, said:\r\n\r\n\"'Madam, I have a great veneration for genius.'\r\n\r\n\"She showed us an unfinished picture from _The Bride of Lammermoor_. The\r\nfigure of Lucy Ashton was completed, and, she told us, was the portrait\r\nof a young friend of hers; but Ravenswood was without a head, and this\r\nshe explained by saying, 'there are no handsome men in Chichester. But,'\r\nshe continued, her countenance brightening, 'the Tenth are expected here\r\nsoon.'\" (The Tenth was noted for its handsome officers.)\r\n\r\nLeslie does not carry the story farther. Whether poor Ravenswood ever\r\ngained his head; whether if he did so it was a military one, or, as a\r\nlast resource, a Chichester one; and where the picture, if completed,\r\nnow is, I do not know, nor have I succeeded in discovering any more of\r\nthe young lady. But passing through the streets of the town I was\r\nconscious of the absence of the Tenth.\r\n\r\nChichester is a perfect example of an English rural capital, thronged on\r\nmarket days with tilt carts, each bringing a farmer or farmer's wife,\r\nand rich in those well-stored ironmongers' shops that one never sees\r\nelsewhere. But it is more than this: it is also a cathedral town, with\r\nthe ever present sense of domination by the cloth even when the cloth is\r\nnot visible. Chichester has its roughs and its public houses (Mr. Hudson\r\nin his _Nature in Downland_ gives them a caustic chapter); it also has\r\nits race-week every July, and barracks within hail; yet it is always a\r\ncathedral town. Whatever noise may be in the air you know in your heart\r\nthat quietude is its true characteristic. One might say that above the\r\nloudest street cries you are continually conscious of the silence of the\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chichester Cathedral._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL]\r\n\r\nChichester's cathedral is not among the most beautiful or the most\r\ninteresting, but there is none cooler. It dates from the eleventh\r\ncentury and contains specimens of almost every kind of church\r\narchitecture; but the spire is comparatively new, having been built in\r\n1866 to take the place of its predecessor, which suddenly dropped like\r\nan extinguisher five years before. Seen from the Channel it rises, a\r\nfriendly landmark (white or gray, according to the clouds), and while\r\nwalking on the Downs above or on the plain around, one is frequently\r\npleased to catch an unexpected glimpse of its tapering beauty. I have\r\nheard it said that Chichester is the only English cathedral that is\r\nvisible at sea.\r\n\r\nWithin, the cathedral is disappointing, offering one neither richness on\r\nthe one hand nor the charm of pure severity on the other. A cathedral\r\nmust either be plain or coloured, and Chichester comes short of both\r\nideals; it has no colour and no purity. Its proportions are, however,\r\nexquisite, and it is impossible to remain here long without passing\r\nunder the spell of the stone. Yet had it, one feels, only radiance, how\r\nmuch finer it would be.\r\n\r\nFor the completest contrast to the vastness of the cathedral one may\r\ncross into North Street and enter the portal of the toy church of St.\r\nOlave, which dates from the 14th century, and is remarkable, not only\r\nfor its minuteness, but as being one of the churches of Chichester\r\nwhich, in my experience, is not normally locked and barred.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROMAN CHICHESTER]\r\n\r\nThat Chichester was built by the Romans in the geometrical Roman way you\r\nmay see as you look down from the Bell Tower upon its four main\r\nstreets--north, south, east and west--east becoming Stane-street and\r\nrunning direct to London. Chichester then was Regnum. On the departure\r\nof the Romans, Cissa, son of Ella, took possession, and the name was\r\nchanged to Cissa's Ceastre, hence Chichester. Remnants of the old walls\r\nstill stand; and a path has been made on the portion running from North\r\nStreet down to West Gate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A CLERICAL STRONGHOLD]\r\n\r\nMore attractive, because more human, than the cathedral itself are its\r\nprecincts: the long resounding cloisters, the still, discreet lanes\r\npopulous with clerics, and most of all that little terrace of\r\necclesiastical residences parallel with South Street, in the shadow of\r\nthe mighty fane, covered with creeping greenness, from wistaria to\r\nampelopsis, with minute windows, inviolable front doors and trim front\r\ngardens, which (like all similar settlements) remind one of alms-houses\r\ncarried out to the highest power. Surely the best of places in which to\r\nedit Horace afresh or find new meanings in St. Augustine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chichester Cross._]\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency for the cathedral to absorb all the attention of the\r\ntraveller, but Chichester has other beauties, including the Market\r\nCross, which is a mere child of stone, dating only from the reign of\r\nHenry VIII.; St. Mary's Hospital in North Street; and the remains of the\r\nmonastery of the Grey Friars in the Priory Park. Young Chichester now\r\nplays cricket where of old the monks caught fish and performed their\r\nduties. It was probably on the mound that their Calvary stood; the last\r\ntime I climbed it was to watch Bonnor, the Australian giant, practising\r\nin the nets below, too many years ago.\r\n\r\nLike all cathedral towns Chichester has beautiful gardens, as one may\r\nsee from the campanile. There are no lawns like the lawns of Bishops,\r\nDeans, and Colleges; and few flower beds more luxuriantly stocked.\r\nChichester also has a number of grave, solid houses, such as Miss\r\nAusten's characters might have lived in; at least one superb specimen of\r\nthe art of Sir Christopher Wren, a masterpiece of substantial red brick;\r\nand a noble inn, the Dolphin, where one dines in the Assembly room, a\r\nrelic of the good times before inns became hotels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPERSHOTT'S RECOLLECTIONS]\r\n\r\nWe have some glimpses of old Chichester in the reminiscences (about\r\n1720-1730) of James Spershott, a Chichester Baptist Elder, who died in\r\n1789, aged eighty. I quote a passage here and there from his paper of\r\nrecollections printed in the Sussex Archæological Collections:--\r\n\r\n\"Spinning of Household Linnen was in use in most Families, also making\r\ntheir own Bread, and likewise their own Household Physick. No Tea, but\r\nmuch Industrey and good Cheer. The Bacon racks were loaded with Bacon,\r\nfor little Porke was made in these times. The farmers' Wifes and\r\nDaughters were plain in Dress, and made no such gay figures in our\r\nMarket as nowadays. At Christmas, the whole Constellation of Pattypans\r\nwhich adorn'd their Chimney fronts were taken down. The Spit, the Pot,\r\nthe Oven, were all in use together; the Evenings spent in Jollity, and\r\ntheir Glass Guns smoking Top'd the Tumbler with the froth of Good\r\nOctober, till most of them were slain or wounded, and the Prince of\r\nOrange, and Queen Ann's Marlborough, could no longer be resounded....\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE DEATH OF A SWEARER]\r\n\r\nHere is Mr. Spershott's account of a Chichester calamity:--\"Jno. Page,\r\nEsq., native of this city, coming from London to Stand Candidate Here, a\r\ngreat number of voters went on Horseback to meet him. Among the rest Mr.\r\nJoshua Lover, a noted School Master, a sober man in the general but of\r\nflighty Passions. As he was setting out, one of his Scollers, Patty\r\nSmith (afterwards my Spouse) asked him for a Coppy, and in haste he\r\nwrote the following:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Extreames beget Extreames, Extreames avoid\r\n     Extreames without Extreames are not Enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He set off in High Carrier, and turning down Rooks's Hill before the\r\nSqr., rideing like a madman To and fro, forward and backward Hallooing\r\namong the Company, the Horse at full speed fell with him and kill'd him.\r\nA Caution to the flighty and unsteady; and a verification of his Coppy.\"\r\nAgain: \"Robt. Madlock, a most Prophane Swarer, being Employ'd in\r\nCleaning the outside of the Steeple,\" fell, owing to a breaking rope,\r\nand soon after died. Mr. Spershott adds: \"A warning to Swarers.\" Another\r\nentry states: \"In my younger years there were many very large corpulent\r\nPersons in the City, both of Men and Women. I could now recite by name\r\nbetween twenty and thirty, the great part of that number so Prodigious\r\nthat like other animals Thoroughly fatted, they could hardly move\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Chichester's epitaphs runs thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Here lies a true soldier, whom all must applaud;\r\n     Much hardship he suffer'd at home and abroad;\r\n     But the hardest engagement he ever was in,\r\n     Was the battle of Self in the conquest of Sin.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PERFECT ALMSHOUSE]\r\n\r\nI have left until the last the prettiest thing in this city of comely\r\nstreets and houses--St. Mary's Hospital, at the end of Lion Street (out\r\nof North Street): the quaintest almshouse in the world. The building\r\nstands back, behind the ordinary houses, and is gained by a passage and\r\na courtyard. You then enter what seems to be a church, for at the far\r\nend is an altar beneath an unmistakably ecclesiastical window. But when\r\nthe first feeling of surprise has passed, you discover that there is\r\nonly a small chancel at the east end of the building, on either side of\r\nwhich are little dwellings. Each of these is occupied by a nice little\r\nold woman, who has two rooms, very minute and cosy, with a little supply\r\nof faggots close at hand, and all the dignity of a householder, although\r\nthe occupant only of an infinitesimal toy house within a house. How do\r\nthey agree, one wonders, these little old ladies of a touchy age under\r\ntheir great roof?\r\n\r\nDifferent accounts are given of the origin of St. Mary's Hospital. Mr.\r\nLower says that it was founded in 1229 for a chaplain and thirteen\r\nbedesmen. In 1562 a warden and five inmates were the prescribed\r\noccupants. Now there are eight sets of rooms, each with its demure\r\ntenant, all of whom troop into the little chapel at fixed hours. Mrs.\r\nEvans, sacristan, who does the honours, would tell me nothing as to the\r\nprocess of selection by which she and the seven other occupants came to\r\nbe living there; all that she could say was that she was very happy to\r\nbe a Hospitaller, and that by no possibility could one of the little\r\ndomiciles ever fall to me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Ruined Nave of Boxgrove._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCHICHESTER AND THE HILLS.\r\n\r\n     Goodwood--The art of being a park--The Cenotaph of Lord\r\n     Darnley--Boxgrove--Cowper at Eastham--The Charlton Hunt--A famous\r\n     run--Huntsman and Saint--Present day hunting in Sussex--Mr. Knox's\r\n     delectable day with his gun--Kingly Bottom--The best white\r\n     violets--A demon bowler--Two epitaphs.\r\n\r\n\r\nChichester may have a cathedral and a history, but nine out of ten\r\nstrangers know of it only as a station for Goodwood race-course; towards\r\nwhich, in that hot week at the end of July, hundreds of carriages toil\r\nby the steep road that skirts the Duke of Richmond and Gordon's park.\r\n\r\nGoodwood Park gives me little pleasure. I miss the deer; and when the\r\nfirst park that one ever knew was Buxted, with its moving antlers above\r\nthe brake fern, one almost is compelled to withhold the word park from\r\nany enclosure without them. It is impossible to lose the feeling that\r\nthe right place for cattle--even for Alderneys--is the meadow. Cows in a\r\npark are a poor makeshift; parks are for deer. To my eyes Goodwood\r\nHouse has a chilling exterior; the road to the hill-top is steep and\r\nlengthy; and when one has climbed it and crossed the summit wood, it is\r\nto come upon the last thing that one wishes to find in the heart of the\r\ncountry, among rolling Downs, sacred to hawks and solitude--a Grand\r\nStand and the railings of a race-course! Race-courses are for the\r\noutskirts of towns, as at Brighton and Lewes; or for hills that have no\r\nmystery and no magic, like the heights of Epsom; or for such mockeries\r\nof parks as Sandown and Kempton. The good park has many deer and no\r\nrace-course.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Goodwood is superb, for it has some of the finest trees in\r\nSussex within its walls, including the survivors of a thousand cedars of\r\nLebanon planted a hundred and fifty years ago; and with every step\r\nhigher one unfolds a wider view of the Channel and the plain. Best of\r\nthese prospects is, perhaps, that gained from Carne's seat, as the\r\nBelvedere to the left of the road to the racecourse is called; its name\r\nderiving from an old servant of the family, whose wooden hut was\r\nsituated here when Carne died, and whose name and fame were thus\r\nperpetuated. The stones of the building were in part those of old Hove\r\nchurch, near Brighton, then lately demolished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CENOTAPH OF DARNLEY]\r\n\r\nIn Goodwood House, which is shown on regular days, are fine Vandycks and\r\nLelys, relics of the two Charles', and above all the fascinatingly\r\nabsorbing \"Cenotaph of Lord Darnley,\" a series of scenes in the life of\r\nthat ill-fated husband. It may be said that among all the treasures of\r\nSussex there is nothing quite so interesting as this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Boxgrove Priory Church._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BOXGROVE]\r\n\r\nLeaving Chichester by East Street (or Stane Street, the old Roman road\r\nto London) one comes first to West Hampnett, famous as the birthplace,\r\nin 1792, of Frederick William Lillywhite, the \"Nonpareil\" bowler, whom\r\nwe shall meet again at Brighton. A mile and a half beyond is Halnaker,\r\nmidway between two ruins, those of Halnaker House to the north and\r\nBoxgrove Priory to the south. Of the remains of Halnaker House, a Tudor\r\nmansion, once the home of the De la Warrs, little may now be seen; but\r\nBoxgrove is still very beautiful, as Mr. Griggs' drawings prove. The\r\nPriory dates from the reign of Henry I., when it was founded very\r\nmodestly for three Benedictine monks, a number which steadily grew.\r\nSeven Henries later came its downfall, and now nothing remains but some\r\nexquisite Norman arches and a few less perfect fragments. Boxgrove\r\nchurch is an object of pilgrimage for antiquaries and architects, the\r\nvaulting being peculiarly interesting. At the Halnaker Arms in 1902 was\r\na landlady whom few cooks could teach anything in the matter of pastry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE EARTHAM DILLETANTE]\r\n\r\nThe next village on Stane Street, or rather a little south of it, about\r\ntwo miles beyond Halnaker, is Eartham; which brings to mind William\r\nHayley, the friend and biographer of Cowper and the author of _The\r\nTriumphs of Temper_, perhaps the least read of any book that once was\r\npopular. Hayley succeeded his father as squire of Eartham; here he\r\nentertained Cowper and other friends; here Romney painted. When need\r\ncame for retrenchment, Hayley let Eartham to Huskisson, the statesman,\r\nand moved to Felpham, on the coast, where we shall meet with him again.\r\nCowper's occupations upon this charming Sussex hillside are recorded in\r\nHayley's account of the visit: \"_Homer_ was not the immediate object of\r\nour attention while Cowper resided at Eartham. The morning hours that we\r\ncould bestow on books were chiefly devoted to a complete revisal and\r\ncorrection of all the translations, which my friend had finished, from\r\nthe Latin and Italian poetry of Milton; and we generally amused\r\nourselves after dinner in forming together a rapid metrical version of\r\nAndreini's _Adamo_. But the constant care which the delicate health of\r\nMrs. Unwin required rendered it impossible for us to be very assiduous\r\nin study, and perhaps the best of all studies was to promote and share\r\nthat most singular and most exemplary tenderness of attention with which\r\nCowper incessantly laboured to counteract every infirmity, bodily and\r\nmental, with which sickness and age had conspired to load this\r\ninteresting guardian of his afflicted life.... The air of the south\r\ninfused a little portion of fresh strength into her shattered frame, and\r\nto give it all possible efficacy, the boy, whom I have mentioned, and a\r\nyoung associate and fellow student of his, employed themselves regularly\r\ntwice a day in drawing this venerable cripple in a commodious\r\ngarden-chair round the airy hill of Eartham. To Cowper and to me it was\r\na very pleasing spectacle to see the benevolent vivacity of blooming\r\nyouth thus continually labouring for the ease, health, and amusement of\r\ndisabled age.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COWPER IN SUSSEX]\r\n\r\nThe poet and Mrs. Unwin, after much trepidation and doubt, had left\r\nWeston Underwood on August 1, 1792; they slept at Barnet the first\r\nnight, Ripley the next, and were at Eartham by ten o'clock on the third.\r\nThey stayed till September. Cowper describes Hayley's estate as one of\r\nthe most delightful pleasure grounds in the world. \"I had no conception\r\nthat a poet could be the owner of such a paradise, and his house is as\r\nelegant as his scenes are charming.\" The poet, apart from his rapid\r\ntreatment of _Adamo_, did not succeed independently in attaining to\r\nHayley's fluency among these surroundings. \"I am in truth so\r\nunaccountably local in the use of my pen,\" he wrote to Lady Hesketh,\r\n\"that, like the man in the fable, who could leap well nowhere but at\r\nRhodes, I seem incapable of writing at all except at Weston.\" Hence the\r\nonly piece that he composed in our county was the epitaph on Fop, a dog\r\nbelonging to Lady Throckmorton. But while he was at Eartham Romney drew\r\nhis portrait in crayons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Boxgrove from the South._]\r\n\r\nCowper always looked back upon his visit with pleasure, but, as he\r\nremarked, the genius of Weston Underwood suited him better--\"It has an\r\nair of snug concealment in which a disposition like mine feels itself\r\npeculiarly gratified; whereas now I see from every window woods like\r\nforests and hills like mountains--a wilderness, in short, that rather\r\nincreases my natural melancholy.... Accordingly, I have not looked out\r\nfor a house in Sussex, nor shall.\"\r\n\r\nThe simplest road from Chichester to the Downs is the railway. The\r\nlittle train climbs laboriously to Singleton, and then descends to\r\nCocking and Midhurst. By leaving it at Singleton one is quickly in the\r\nheart of this vast district of wooded hills, sometimes wholly forested,\r\nsometimes, as in West Dean park, curiously studded with circular clumps\r\nof trees.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CHARLTON HUNT]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting spot to the east of the line is Charlton, once so\r\nfamous among sporting men, but now, alas, unknown. For Charlton was of\r\nold a southern Melton Mowbray, the very centre of the aristocratic\r\nhunting county. The Charlton Hunt had two palmy periods: before the Duke\r\nof Monmouth's rebellion, and after the accession of William III.\r\nMonmouth and Lord Grey kept two packs, the Master being Squire Roper.\r\nWith the fall of Monmouth Roper fled to France, to hunt at Chantilly,\r\nbut on the accession of William III. he returned to Sussex, the hounds\r\nresumed their old condition, and the Charlton pack became the most\r\nfamous in the world. On the death of Mr. Roper--in the hunting field, in\r\n1715, at the age of eighty-four--the Duke of Bolton took the Mastership,\r\nwhich he held until the charms of Miss Fenton the actress (the Polly\r\nPeachum of _The Beggars' Opera_) lured him to the tents of the women.\r\nThen came the glorious reign of the second Duke of Richmond, when sport\r\nwith the Charlton was at its height. The Charlton Hunt declined upon his\r\ndeath, in 1750, became known as the Goodwood Hunt, and wholly ceased to\r\nbe at the beginning of the last century.\r\n\r\nThe crowning glory of the Charlton Hunt was the run of Friday, January\r\n26, 1738, which is thus described in an old manuscript:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A FAMOUS RUN]\r\n\r\n\r\n     A FULL AND IMPARTIAL ACCOUNT OF THE REMARKABLE CHASE AT CHARLTON,\r\n     ON FRIDAY, 26TH JANUARY, 1738.\r\n\r\n     It has long been a matter of controversy in the hunting world to\r\n     what particular country or set of men the superiority belonged.\r\n     Prejudices and partiality have the greatest share in their\r\n     disputes, and every society their proper champion to assert the\r\n     pre-eminence and bring home the trophy to their own country. Even\r\n     Richmond Park has the Dymoke. But on Friday, the 26th of January,\r\n     1738, there was a decisive engagement on the plains of Sussex,\r\n     which, after ten hours' struggle, has settled all further debate\r\n     and given the brush to the gentlemen of Charlton.\r\n\r\n     PRESENT IN THE MORNING:--\r\n\r\n     The Duke of Richmond, Duchess of Richmond, Duke of St Alban's, the\r\n     Lord Viscount Harcourt, the Lord Henry Beauclerk, the Lord\r\n     Ossulstone, Sir Harry Liddell, Brigadier Henry Hawley, Ralph\r\n     Jennison, master of His Majesty's Buck Hounds, Edward Pauncefort,\r\n     Esq., William Farquhar, Esq., Cornet Philip Honywood, Richard\r\n     Biddulph, Esq., Charles Biddulph, Esq., Mr. St. Paul, Mr. Johnson,\r\n     Mr. Peerman, of Chichester; Mr. Thomson, Tom Johnson, Billy Ives,\r\n     Yeoman Pricker to His Majesty's Hounds; David Briggs and Nim Ives,\r\n     Whippers-in.\r\n\r\n     At a quarter before eight in the morning the fox was found in\r\n     Eastdean Wood, and ran an hour in that cover; then into the Forest,\r\n     up to Puntice Coppice through Heringdean to the Marlows, up to\r\n     Coney Coppice, back to the Marlows, to the Forest West Gate, over\r\n     the fields to Nightingale Bottom, to Cobden's at Draught, up his\r\n     Pine Pit Hanger, where His Grace of St. Alban's got a fall; through\r\n     My Lady Lewknor's Puttocks, and missed the earth; through Westdean\r\n     Forest to the corner of Collar Down (where Lord Harcourt blew his\r\n     first horse), crossed the Hackney-place down the length of Coney\r\n     Coppice, through the Marlows to Heringdean, into the Forest and\r\n     Puntice Coppice, Eastdean Wood, through the Lower Teglease across\r\n     by Cocking Course down between Graffham and Woolavington, through\r\n     Mr. Orme's Park and Paddock over the Heath to Fielder's Furzes, to\r\n     the Harlands, Selham, Ambersham, through Todham Furzes, over Todham\r\n     Heath, almost to Cowdray Park, there turned to the limekiln at the\r\n     end of Cocking Causeway, through Cocking Park and Furzes; there\r\n     crossed the road and up the hills between Bepton and Cocking. Here\r\n     the unfortunate Lord Harcourt's second horse felt the effects of\r\n     long legs and a sudden steep; the best thing that belonged to him\r\n     was his saddle, which My Lord had secured; but, by bleeding and\r\n     Geneva (contrary to Act of Parliament) he recovered, and with some\r\n     difficulty was got home. Here Mr. Farquhar's humanity claims your\r\n     regard, who kindly sympathised with My Lord in his misfortunes, and\r\n     had not power to go beyond him. At the bottom of Cocking Warren\r\n     the hounds turned to the left across the road by the barn near\r\n     Heringdean, then took the side near to the north-gate of the Forest\r\n     (Here General Hawley thought it prudent to change his horse for a\r\n     true-blue that staid up the hills). Billy Ives likewise took a\r\n     horse of Sir Harry Liddell's, went quite through the Forest and run\r\n     the foil through Nightingale Bottom to Cobden at Draught, up his\r\n     Pine Pit Hanger to My Lady Lewknor's Puttocks, through every mews\r\n     she went in the morning; went through the Warren above Westdean\r\n     (where we dropt Sir Harry Liddell) down to Benderton Farm (here\r\n     Lord Harry sank), through Goodwood Park (here the Duke of Richmond\r\n     chose to send three lame horses back to Charlton, and took Saucy\r\n     Face and Sir William, that were luckily at Goodwood; from thence,\r\n     at a distance, Lord Harry was seen driving his horse before him to\r\n     Charlton). The hounds went out at the upper end of the Park over\r\n     Strettington-road by Sealy Coppice (where His Grace of Richmond got\r\n     a summerset), through Halnaker Park over Halnaker Hill to Seabeach\r\n     Farm (here the Master of the Stag Hounds, Cornet Honywood, Tom\r\n     Johnson, and Nim Ives were thoroughly satisfied), up Long Down,\r\n     through Eartham Common fields and Kemp's High Wood (here Billy Ives\r\n     tried his second horse and took Sir William, by which the Duke of\r\n     St. Alban's had no great coat, so returned to Charlton). From\r\n     Kemp's High Wood the hounds took away through Gunworth Warren,\r\n     Kemp's Rough Piece, over Slindon Down to Madehurst Parsonage (where\r\n     Billy came in with them), over Poor Down up to Madehurst, then down\r\n     to Houghton Forest, where His Grace of Richmond, General Hawley,\r\n     and Mr. Pauncefort came in (the latter to little purpose, for,\r\n     beyond the Ruel Hill, neither Mr. Pauncefort nor his horse Tinker\r\n     cared to go, so wisely returned to his impatient friends), up the\r\n     Ruel Hill, left Sherwood on the right hand, crossed Ofham Hill to\r\n     Southwood, from thence to South Stoke to the wall of Arundel River,\r\n     where the glorious 23 hounds put an end to the campaign, and killed\r\n     an old bitch fox, ten minutes before six. Billy Ives, His Grace of\r\n     Richmond, and General Hawley were the only persons in at the death,\r\n     to the immortal honour of 17 stone, and at least as many campaigns.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JOHNSON THE EXEMPLAR]\r\n\r\nIn Singleton church is a record of the Charlton Hunt in the shape of a\r\nmemorial to one of the huntsmen, the moral of which seems to be that we\r\nmust all be huntsmen too:--\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Near this place lies interred\r\n              THOMAS JOHNSON,\r\n     who departed this life at Charlton,\r\n            December 20th, 1774.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"From his early inclination to fox-hounds, he soon became an experienced\r\nhuntsman. His knowledge in the profession, wherein he had no superior,\r\nand hardly an equal, joined to his honesty in every other particular,\r\nrecommended him to the service, and gained him the approbation, of\r\nseveral of the nobility and gentry. Among these were the Lord CONWAY,\r\nEarl of CARDIGAN, the Lord GOWER, the Duke of MARLBOROUGH, the Hon. M.\r\nSPENCER. The last master whom he served, and in whose service he died,\r\nwas CHARLES, Duke of RICHMOND, LENNOX, and AUBIGNY, who erected this\r\nmonument in memory of a good and faithful servant, as a reward to the\r\ndeceased, and an incitement to the living.\r\n\r\n'Go, and do thou likewise.' (St. Luke, x. 37).\r\n\r\n\r\n     'Here Johnson lies; what human can deny\r\n     Old Honest Tom the tribute of a sigh?\r\n     Deaf is that ear which caught the opening sound;\r\n     Dumb that tongue which cheer'd the hills around.\r\n     Unpleasing truth: Death hunts us from our birth\r\n     In view, and men, like foxes, take to earth.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SUSSEX PACKS]\r\n\r\nA few words on the packs of Sussex at the present time may be\r\ninteresting in this connection. Chief is the Southdown Fox Hounds, a\r\nvery fine, fast pack brought to a high state of perfection by the late\r\nmaster, the Hon. Charles Brand. They hunt the open and hill country\r\nbetween the Adur and Cuckmere, between Haywards Heath and the sea. In\r\nthe north are the Crawley and Horsham Fox Hounds, which have large\r\nwoodlands, high hedges, and some stiff ploughed soil to their less easy\r\nlot. The hounds are bigger and heavier than the South Downers. Smaller\r\npacks are Lord Leconfield's Fox Hounds, which have the Charlton country;\r\nthe Eastbourne Fox Hounds, to which the East Sussex Fox Hounds allotted\r\na share of the western part of their country east of the Cuckmere; and\r\nthe Burstow and Eridge packs. Of Harriers, the best are the Brighton\r\nHarriers, so long hunted by Mr. Hugh Gorringe of Kingston-by-Sea, a very\r\nsmart pack lately covering the ground between the Adur and Falmer, and\r\nnow adding the Brookside Harriers' country to their own domain, the two\r\npacks having been amalgamated. In the east are the Bexhill Harriers and\r\nthe Hailsham Harriers; and in the west the South Coast Harriers, for the\r\nChichester country. Sussex, in addition to possessing the Warnham\r\nStaghounds, is much raided by the Surrey Staghounds. The Crowhurst Otter\r\nHounds also visit the Sussex streams now and then. Foot Beagles may be\r\nnumerous but I know only of the Brighton pack.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MR. KNOX'S SETTER]\r\n\r\nAnd here let me give Mr. Knox's description of a day's shooting, in the\r\ngentlemanly way, on the Sussex Downs, following, in his _Ornithological\r\nRambles_, upon some remarks on the battue. \"How different is the pursuit\r\nof the pheasant with the aid of spaniels in the thick covers of the\r\nweald, or tracking him with a single setter among some of the wilder\r\nportions of the forest range!--intently observing your dog and\r\nanticipating the wily artifices of some old cock, with spurs as long as\r\na dragon's, who will sometimes lead you for a mile through bog, brake,\r\nfern, and heather, before the sudden drop of your staunch companion, and\r\na rigidity in all his limbs, satisfy you that you have at last compelled\r\nthe bird to squat under that wide holly-bush, from whence you kick him\r\nup, and feel some little exultation as you bring him down with a\r\nsnap-shot, having only caught a glimpse of him through the evergreen\r\nboughs, as he endeavoured to escape by a rapid flight at the opposite\r\nside of the tree.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A SUSSEX BAG]\r\n\r\n\"And then the woodcock-shooting in November--I must take you back once\r\nmore to my favourite Downs. With the first full moon during that month,\r\nespecially if the wind be easterly or the weather calm, arrive flights\r\nof woodcocks, which drop in the covers, and are dispersed among the\r\nbushy valleys, and even over the heathery summits of the hills. If it\r\nshould happen to be a propitious year for beech-mast--the great\r\nattraction to pheasants on the Downs, as is the acorn in the weald--you\r\nmay procure partridges, pheasants, hares, and rabbits in perhaps equal\r\nproportions, with half a dozen woodcocks to crown the bag.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _East Lavant._]\r\n\r\n\"The extensive, undulating commons and heaths dotted with broken patches\r\nof Scotch firs and hollies on the ferruginous sand north of the Downs,\r\nafford--where the manorial rights are enforced--still greater variety of\r\nsport. On this wild ground, accompanied by my spaniels and an old\r\nretriever, and attended only by one man, to carry the game, I have\r\nenjoyed as good sport as mortal need desire on this side of the Tweed.\r\nHere is a rough sketch of a morning's work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PARTRIDGE AND WOODCOCK]\r\n\r\n\"Commencing operations by walking across a turnip-field, two or three\r\ncoveys spring wildly from the farther end, and fly, as I expect, to the\r\nadjoining common, where they are marked down on a brow thickly clothed\r\nwith furze. Marching towards them with spaniels at heel, up jumps a hare\r\nunder my nose, then another, then a rabbit. I reload rapidly, and on\r\nreaching the gorse 'put in' the dogs. Whirr! there goes a partridge! The\r\nspaniels drop to the report of my gun, but the fluttering wings of the\r\ndying bird rouse two of his neighbours before I am ready, and away they\r\nfly, screaming loudly. The remainder are flushed in detail and I succeed\r\nin securing the greater part of them. Now for the next covey. They were\r\nmarked down in that little hollow where the heather is longer than\r\nusual--a beautiful spot! But before I reach it, up they all spring in an\r\nunexpected quarter; that cunning old patriarch at their head had\r\ncleverly called them together to a naked part of the hill from whence he\r\ncould observe my manoeuvres, and a random shot sent after him with\r\nhearty good will proved totally ineffective.\r\n\r\n\"Now the spaniels are worming through the thick sedges on either side of\r\nthe brook which intersects the moor, and by their bustling anxiety it is\r\neasy to see that game is afoot. Keeping well in front of them, I am just\r\nin time for a satisfactory right and left at two cock pheasants, which\r\nthey had hunted down to the very edge of the water before they could\r\npersuade them to take wing. Now for that little alder coppice at the\r\nfurther end of the marshy swamp. Hark to that whipping sound so\r\ndifferent from the rush of the rising pheasant or the drumming flight of\r\nthe partridge! I cannot see the bird, but I know it is a woodcock. This\r\nmust be one of his favourite haunts, for I perceive the tracks of his\r\nfeet and the perforations of his bill in every direction on the black\r\nmud around. Mark! again. A second is sprung, and as he flits between the\r\nnaked alders a snap-shot stops his career. I now emerge at the farther\r\nend, just where the trees are thinner than elsewhere. A wisp of snipes\r\nutter their well-known cry and scud over the heath; one of these is\r\nsecured. The rest fly towards a little pool of dark water lying at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the common, a well-known rendezvous for\r\nthose birds. Cautiously approaching, down wind, I reach the margin. Up\r\nsprings a snipe; but just as my finger is on the trigger, and when too\r\nlate to alter my intention, a duck and mallard rise from among the\r\nrushes and wheel round my head. One barrel is fortunately left, and the\r\ndrake comes tumbling to the ground. Three or four pheasants, another\r\ncouple of woodcocks, a few more snipes, a teal or two, and half a dozen\r\nrabbits picked up at various intervals, complete the day's sport, and I\r\nreturn home, better pleased with myself and my dogs than if we had\r\ncompassed the destruction of all the hares in the county, or assisted at\r\nthe immolation of a perfect hecatomb of pheasants.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: KINGLY BOTTOM]\r\n\r\nKingly Bottom is the most interesting spot to the west of Singleton. One\r\nmay reach it either through Chilgrove, or by walking back towards\r\nChichester as far as Binderton House, turning then to the right and\r\nwalking due west for a couple of miles. Report says that the yews in\r\nKingly Bottom, or Kingly Vale, mark a victory of Chichester men over a\r\nparty of marauding Danes in 900, and that the dead were buried beneath\r\nthe barrows on the hill. The story ought to be true. The vale is\r\nremarkable for its grove of yews, some of enormous girth, which extends\r\nalong the bottom to the foot of the escarpment. The charge that might be\r\nbrought against Sussex, that it lacks sombre scenery and the elements of\r\ndark romance, that its character is too open and transparent, would be\r\nurged to no purpose in Kingly Vale, which, always grave and silent, is\r\ntransformed at dusk into a sinister and fantastic forest, a home for\r\nwitchcraft and unquiet spirits.\r\n\r\nSo it seems to me; but among the verses of Bernard Barton, the Quaker\r\npoet and the friend of Charles Lamb, I lately chanced upon a sonnet\r\n\"written on hearing it remarked that the scenery [of Kingly Bottom] was\r\ntoo gloomy to be termed beautiful; and that it was also associated with\r\ndolorous recollections of Druidical sacrifices.\" In this poem Barton\r\ntakes a surprisingly novel line. \"Nay, nay, it is not gloomy\" he begins,\r\nand the end is thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Nor fancy Druid rites have left a stain\r\n       Upon its gentle beauties:--loiter there\r\n       In a calm summer night, confess how fair\r\n     Its moonlight charms, and thou wilt learn how vain\r\n     And transitory Superstition's reign\r\n       Over a spot which gladsome thoughts may share.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordinary person, not a poet, would, I fear, prefer to think of\r\nKingly Bottom's Druidical past.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MARDEN VIOLETS]\r\n\r\nThe last time I was in Kingly Bottom--it was in April--after leaving the\r\nbarrows on the summit of the Bow Hill, above the Vale, I walked by\r\ndevious ways to East Marden, between banks thick with the whitest and\r\nsweetest of sweet white violets. East Marden, however, has no inn and is\r\ntherefore not the best friend of the traveller; but it has the most\r\nmodest and least ecclesiastical-looking church in the world, and by\r\nseeking it out I learned two secrets: the finest place for white violets\r\nand the finest place to keep a horse. There is no riding country to\r\nexcel this hill district between Singleton and the Hampshire border.\r\n\r\nAt the neighbouring village of Stoughton, whither I meant to walk (since\r\nan inn is there) was born, in 1783, the terrible George Brown--Brown of\r\nBrighton--the fast bowler, whose arm was as thick as an ordinary man's\r\nthigh. He had two long stops, one of whom padded his chest with straw. A\r\nlong stop once held his coat before one of Brown's balls, but the ball\r\nwent through it and killed a dog on the other side. Brown could throw a\r\n4-1/2 oz. ball 137 yards, and he was the father of seventeen children.\r\nHe died at Sompting in 1857.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHURCHYARD POETRY]\r\n\r\nOf Racton, on the Hampshire border, and its association with Charles\r\nII., I have already spoken. Below, it is Westbourne, a small border\r\nvillage in whose churchyard are two pleasing epitaphs. Of Jane, wife of\r\nThomas Curtis, who died in 1719, it is written:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     She was like a lily fresh and green,\r\n     Soon cast down and no more seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nand of John Cook:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Pope said an honest man\r\n     Is the noblest work of God.\r\n     If Pope's assertion be from error clear,\r\n     One of God's noblest works lies buried here.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bosham._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCHICHESTER AND THE PLAIN\r\n\r\n     Bosham and history--An expensive pun--The Bosham bells--Chidham\r\n     wheat--The Manhood peninsula--Selsey's adders--Selsey Bill--St.\r\n     Wilfrid and the Sussex heathen--Pagham Harbour in its palmy\r\n     days--Bognor--Felpham's great rider--Mr. Hayley and Mrs. Opie--An\r\n     epitaph and a poem--A fairy's funeral--William Blake in Sussex--The\r\n     trial of a traitor.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn leaving Chichester West Street becomes the Portsmouth Road and passes\r\nthrough Fishbourne, a pleasant but dusty village. A mile or so beyond,\r\nand a little to the south, is Bosham, on one of the several arms of\r\nChichester Harbour, once of some importance but now chiefly mud. Bosham\r\nis the most interesting village in what may be called the Selsey\r\npeninsula. Yet how has its glory diminished! What is now a quiet abode\r\nof fishermen and the tarrying-place of yachtsmen and artists (there are\r\nfew Royal Academy exhibitions without the spire of Bosham church) has\r\nbeen in its time a very factory of history. Vespasian's camp was hard\r\nby, and it is possible that certain Roman remains that have been found\r\nhere were once part of his palace. Bosham claims to be the scene of\r\nCanute's encounter with the encroaching tide; which may be the case,\r\nalthough one has always thought of the king rebuking his flatterers\r\nrather by the margin of the ocean itself than inland at an estuary's\r\nedge. But beyond question Canute had a palace here, and his daughter was\r\nburied in the church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A COSTLY PUN]\r\n\r\nEarl Godwin, father of Harold, last of the Saxons, dwelt here also. \"Da\r\nmihi basium\"--give me a kiss--he is fabled to have said to Archbishop\r\nAethelnoth, and on receiving it to have taken the salute as acquiescence\r\nin the request--\"Da mihi Bosham\": probably the earliest and also the\r\nmost expensive recorded example in England of this particular form of\r\nhumour.\r\n\r\nIt was from Bosham that Harold sailed on that visit to the Duke of\r\nNormandy which resulted in the battle of Hastings. In the Bayeux\r\ntapestry he may be seen riding to Bosham with his company, and also\r\nputting up prayers for the success of his mission. Of this success we\r\nshall see more when we come to Battle. Bosham furthermore claims Hubert\r\nof Bosham, the author of the _Book of Becket's Martyrdom_, who was with\r\nSaint Thomas of Canterbury when the assassins stabbed him to the death.\r\n\r\nThe church is of great age; it is even claimed that the tower is the\r\noriginal Saxon. The circumstance that in the representation of the\r\nedifice in the Bayeux tapestry there is no tower has been urged against\r\nthis theory, although architectural realism in embroidery has never been\r\nvery noticeable. The bells (it is told) were once carried off in a\r\nDanish raid; but they brought their captors no luck--rather the reverse,\r\nsince they so weighed upon the ship that she sank. When the present\r\nbells ring, the ancient submerged peal is said to ring also in sympathy\r\nat the bottom of the Channel--a pretty habit, which would suggest that\r\nbell metal is happily and wisely superior to changes of religion, were\r\nit not explained by the unromantic principles of acoustics.\r\n\r\nA heavy pole, known as the staff of Bevis of Southampton (and Arundel),\r\nwas of old kept in Bosham church.\r\n\r\nAt high water Bosham is the fair abode of peace. When every straggling\r\narm of the harbour is brimming full, when their still surfaces reflect\r\nthe sky with a brighter light, and the fishing boats ride erect, Bosham\r\nis serenely beautiful and restful. But at low tide she is a slut: the\r\nwithdrawing floods lay bare vast tracts of mud; the ships heel over into\r\nattitudes disreputably oblique; stagnation reigns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHIDHAM WHEAT]\r\n\r\nChidham, by Bosham, is widely famous for its wheat. Chidham White, or\r\nHedge, wheat was first produced a little more than a century ago by Mr.\r\nWoods, a farmer. He noticed one afternoon (probably on a Sunday, when\r\nfarmers are most noticing) an unfamiliar patch of wheat growing in a\r\nhedge. It contained thirty ears, in which were fourteen hundred corns.\r\nMr. Woods carefully saved it and sowed it. The crop was eight pounds and\r\na half. These he sowed, and the crop was forty eight gallons. Thus it\r\nmultiplied, until the time came to distribute it to other farmers at a\r\nhigh price. The cultivation of Chidham wheat by Mr. Woods at one side of\r\nthe county, synchronised with the breeding of the best Southdown sheep\r\nby John Ellman at the other, as we shall see later.\r\n\r\nSouth of Chichester stretches the Manhood peninsula, of which Selsey is\r\nthe principal town: the part of Sussex most neglected by the traveller.\r\nIn a county of hills the stranger is not attracted by a district that\r\nmight almost have been hewn out of Holland. But the ornithologist knows\r\nits value, and in a world increasingly bustling and progressive there is\r\na curious fascination in so remote and deliberate a region, over which,\r\neven in the finest weather and during the busiest harvest, a suggestion\r\nof desolation broods. Nothing, one feels, can ever introduce Success\r\ninto this plain, and so thinking, one is at peace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MONOTONY OF MANHOOD]\r\n\r\nA tramway between Chichester and Selsey has to some extent opened up the\r\neast side of the peninsula, but the west is still remote and will\r\nprobably remain so. The country is, however, not interesting: a dead\r\nlevel of dusty road and grass or arable land, broken only by hedges,\r\ndykes, white cottages, and the many homesteads within their ramparts of\r\nwind-swept elms. Wheat and oats are the prevailing crops, still for the\r\nmost part cut and bound by hand. Of the villages in the centre of the\r\npeninsula Sidlesham is the most considerable, with its handsome square\r\nchurch tower and its huge red tide-mill, now silent and weather-worn,\r\nstanding mournfully at the head of the dry harbour of Pagham, whose\r\nwaters once turned its wheels. On the west, on the shores of the Bosham\r\nestuary, or Chichester Harbour, are the sleepy amphibious villages of\r\nAppledram, famous once for its salt and its smugglers, Birdham, and\r\nEarnley. Let no one be tempted to take a direct line across the fields\r\nfrom Selsey to Earnley, for dykes and canals must effectually stop him.\r\nIndeed, cross country walking in this part of the country is practically\r\nan impossibility, except by continuous deviations and doublings. In\r\nattempting one day to reach Earnley from Selsey in this way (after\r\ngiving up the beach in despair), I came upon several adders, and I once\r\nfound one crossing a road absolutely in Selsey.\r\n\r\nSelsey is a straggling white village, or town, over populous with\r\nvisitors in summer, empty, save for its regular inhabitants, in winter.\r\nThe oldest and truest part of Selsey is a fishing village on the east\r\nshore of the Bill, a little settlement of tarred tenements and lobster\r\npots. Selsey church, now on the confines of the town, once stood a mile\r\nor more away; whither it was removed (the stones being numbered) and,\r\nlike Temple Bar, again set up. The chancel was, however, not removed,\r\nbut left desolate in the fields.\r\n\r\nSelsey Bill is a tongue of land projecting into a shallow sea. A\r\nlighthouse being useless to warn strange mariners of the sandbanks of\r\nthis district, a lightship known as the Owers flashes its rays far out\r\nin the channel. The sea has played curious pranks on the Selsey coast.\r\nBeneath the beach and a large tract of the sea now lies what was once,\r\nfour hundred years ago, a park of deer, which in its most prosperous day\r\nextended for miles. The shallow water covering it is still called the\r\npark by the fishermen, who drop their nets where the bucks and does of\r\nSelsey were wont to graze.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUSSEX REPELS ST. WILFRID]\r\n\r\nBut the sea has obliterated more than the pasturage of the deer; a mile\r\ndistant from the present shore stood the first monastery erected in\r\nSussex after Wilfrid's conversion of the South Saxons to Christianity.\r\nAlthough Saint Wilfrid eventually found a home in Sussex and worked hard\r\namong its people, his first attempt to bring Christianity to the county\r\nwas, according to his friend Edda's _Vita Wilfridi_, ill-starred. I\r\nquote the story:--\r\n\r\n\"A great gale blowing from the South-east, the swelling waves threw them\r\non the unknown coast of the South Saxons. The sea too left the ship and\r\nmen, and retreating from the land and leaving the shore uncovered,\r\nretired into the depths of the abyss.\r\n\r\n\"And the heathen, coming with a great army, intended to seize the ship,\r\nto divide the spoil of money, to take them captives forthwith, and to\r\nput to the sword those who resisted. To whom our great bishop spoke\r\ngently and peaceably, offering much money, wishing to redeem their\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\n\"But they with stern and cruel hearts like Pharaoh would not let the\r\npeople of the Lord go, saying proudly that, 'All that the sea threw on\r\nthe land became as much theirs as their own property.'\r\n\r\n\"And the idolatrous chief priest of the heathen, standing on a lofty\r\nmound, strove like Balaam to curse the people of God, and to bind their\r\nhands by his magic arts.\r\n\r\n\"Then one of the bishop's companions hurled, like David, a stone,\r\nblessed by all the people of God, which struck the cursing magician in\r\nthe forehead and pierced his brain, when an unexpected death surprised,\r\nas it did Goliath, falling back a corpse in sandy places.\r\n\r\n\"The heathen therefore preparing to fight, vainly attacked the people of\r\nGod. But the Lord fought for the few, even as Gideon by the command of\r\nthe Lord, with 300 warriors slew at one attack 12,000 of the Midianites.\r\n\r\n\"And so the comrades of our holy bishop, well-armed and brave, though\r\nfew in number (they were 120 men, the number of the years of Moses),\r\ndetermined and agreed that none should turn his back in flight from the\r\nother, but would either win death with glory, or life with victory (for\r\nboth alike are easy to the Lord). So S. Wilfrith with his clerk fell on\r\nhis knees, and lifting his hands to Heaven again sought help from the\r\nLord. For, as Moses triumphed when Hur and Aaron supported his hands, by\r\nfrequently imploring the protection of the Lord, when Joshua the son of\r\nNun was fighting with the people of God against Amalek, thus these few\r\nChristians after thrice repulsing the fierce and untamed heathen, routed\r\nthem with great slaughter, with a loss strange to say of only five on\r\ntheir side.\r\n\r\n\"And their great priest (Wilfrith) prayed to the Lord his God, who\r\nimmediately ordered the sea to return a full hour before its wont. So\r\nthat when the heathen, on the arrival of their king, were preparing for\r\na fourth attack with all their forces, the rising sea covered with its\r\nwaves the whole of the shore, and floated the ship, which sailed into\r\nthe deep. But, greatly glorified by God, and returning Him thanks, with\r\na South wind they reached Sandwich, a harbour of safety.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JOHN WESLEY'S TESTIMONY]\r\n\r\nThe Sussex people, it would seem, do not take kindly to missionaries,\r\nfor John Wesley records that he had less success in this county than in\r\nall England.\r\n\r\nBetween Selsey and Bognor lies Pagham, famous in the pages of Knox's\r\n_Ornithological Rambles_, but otherwise unknown. Of the lost glories of\r\nPagham, which was once a harbour, but is now dry, let Mr. Knox\r\nspeak:--\"Here in the dead long summer days, when not a breath of air\r\nhas been stirring, have I frequently remained for hours, stretched on\r\nthe hot shingle, and gazed at the osprey as he soared aloft, or watched\r\nthe little islands of mud at the turn of the tide, as each gradually\r\nrose from the receding waters, and was successively taken possession of\r\nby flocks of sandpipers and ring-dotterels, after various\r\ncircumvolutions on the part of each detachment, now simultaneously\r\npresenting their snowy breasts to the sunshine, now suddenly turning\r\ntheir dusky backs, so that the dazzled eye lost sight of them from the\r\ncontrast; while the prolonged cry of the titterel,[2] and the melancholy\r\nnote of the peewit from the distant swamp, have mingled with the scream\r\nof the tern and the taunting laugh of the gull.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PAGHAM'S LOST GLORIES]\r\n\r\n\"Here have I watched the oyster-catcher, as he flew from point to point,\r\nand cautiously waded into the shallow water; and the patient heron, that\r\npattern of a fisherman, as with retracted neck, and eyes fixed on\r\nvacancy, he has stood for hours without a single snap, motionless as a\r\nstatue. Here, too, have I pursued the guillemot, or craftily endeavoured\r\nto cut off the retreat of the diver, by mooring my boat across the\r\nnarrow passage through which alone he could return to the open sea\r\nwithout having recourse to his reluctant wings. Nor can I forget how\r\noften, during the Siberian winter of 1838, when 'a whole gale,' as the\r\nsailors have it, has been blowing from the north-east, I used to take up\r\nmy position on the long and narrow ridge of shingle which separated this\r\nparadise from the raging waves without, and sheltered behind a hillock\r\nof seaweed, with my long duck-gun and a trusty double, or half buried in\r\na hole in the sand, I used to watch the legions of water-birds as they\r\nneared the shore, and dropped distrustfully among the breakers, at a\r\ndistance from the desired haven, until, gaining confidence from\r\naccession of numbers, some of the bolder spirits--the pioneers of the\r\narmy--would flap their wings, rise from the white waves, and make for\r\nthe calm water. Here they come! I can see the pied golden-eye\r\npre-eminent among the advancing party; now the pochard, with his\r\ncopper-coloured head and neck, may be distinguished from the darker\r\nscaup-duck; already the finger is on the trigger, when, perhaps, they\r\nsuddenly veer to the right and left, far beyond the reach of my longest\r\nbarrel or, it may be, come swishing overhead, and leave a companion or\r\ntwo struggling on the shingle or floating on the shallow waters of the\r\nharbour.\"\r\n\r\nPagham Harbour is now reclaimed, and where once was mud, or, at high\r\ntide, shallow water, is rank grass and thistles. One ship that seems to\r\nhave waited a little too long before making for the open sea again, now\r\nlies high and dry, a forlorn hulk. Pagham church is among the airiest\r\nthat I know, with a shingle spire, the counterpart of Bosham's on the\r\nother side of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe walk from Pagham to Bognor, along the sand, is uninspiring and not\r\ntoo easy, for the sand can be very soft. About a mile west of Bognor one\r\nis driven inland, just after passing as perfect an example of the simple\r\nyet luxurious seaside home as I remember to have seen: all on one floor,\r\nthatched, shaded by trees, surrounded by its garden and facing the\r\nChannel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EARLY BOGNOR]\r\n\r\nAmong the unattractive types of town few are more dismal than the\r\nwatering-place _manqué_. Bognor must, I fear, come under this heading.\r\nIts reputation, such as it is, was originally made by Princess\r\nCharlotte, daughter of George III., who found the air recuperative, and\r\nwho was probably not unwilling to lend her prestige to a resort, as her\r\nbrother George was doing at Brighton, and her sister Amelia had done at\r\nWorthing. But before the Princess Charlotte Sir Richard Hotham, the\r\nhatter, had come, determined at any cost to make the town popular. One\r\nof his methods was to rename it Hothampton. His efforts were, however,\r\nonly moderately successful, and he died in 1799, leaving to what\r\nHorsfield calls \"his astonished heirs\" only _£_8,000 out of a great\r\nfortune. The name Hothampton soon vanished.\r\n\r\nThe local authorities of Bognor seem to be keenly alive to the value of\r\nenterprise, for their walls are covered with instructions as to what may\r\nor may not be done in the interests of cleanliness and popularity; a new\r\nsea-wall has been built; receptacles for waste paper continually\r\nconfront one, and deck chairs at twopence for three hours are\r\npractically unavoidable. And yet Bognor remains a dull place, once the\r\nvisitor has left his beach abode--tent or bathing box, whichever it may\r\nbe. It seems to be a town without resources. But it has the interest,\r\ndenied one in more fashionable watering-places, of presenting old and\r\nnew Bognor at the same moment; not that old Bognor is really old, but it\r\nis instructive to see the kind of crescent which was considered the last\r\nword in architectural enterprise when our great-grandmothers were young\r\nand would take the sea air.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A POET ON HORSEBACK]\r\n\r\nFrom Bognor it is a mere step to Felpham, a village less than a mile to\r\nthe east. Whether or not one goes there to-day is a matter of taste; but\r\na hundred years ago to omit a visit was to confess one's-self a boor,\r\nfor William Hayley, the poet and friend of genius, lived there, and his\r\ncastellated stucco house became a shrine. At that day it seems to have\r\nbeen no uncommon sight for the visitor to Bognor to be refreshed by the\r\nspectacle of the poet falling from his horse. According to his\r\nbiographer, Cowper's Johnny of Norfolk, Hayley descended to earth almost\r\nas often as Alice's White Knight, partly from the high spirit of his\r\nsteed, and partly from a habit which he never abandoned of wearing\r\nmilitary spurs and carrying an umbrella. The memoir of the poet contains\r\nthis agreeable passage: \"The Editor was once riding gently by his side,\r\non the stony beach of Bognor, when the wind suddenly reversed his\r\numbrella as he unfolded it; his horse, with a single but desperate\r\nplunge, pitched him on his head in an instant.... On another occasion,\r\non the same visit ... he was tost into the air on the Downs, at the\r\nprecise moment when an interested friend whom they had just left, being\r\napprehensive of what would happen, was anxiously viewing him from his\r\nwindow, through a telescope.\" Those who look through telescopes are\r\nrarely so fortunate. It is odd that Hayley, a delicate and heavy man\r\nsuffering from hip-disease, should have taken so little hurt. Although\r\nhe had a covered passage for horse exercise in the grounds of his villa,\r\nno amount of practice seems to have improved his seat. This covered way\r\nhas been removed, but a mulberry tree planted by Hayley still\r\nflourishes.\r\n\r\nWhenever Hayley was ill he became an object of intense interest to\r\nvisitors at Bognor. Binsted's Library in the town exhibited a daily\r\nbulletin; and in 1819 the Prince and Princess of Saxe-Coburg called upon\r\nhim, while the Princess of Hesse Homburg on her return sent a\r\nprescription from Germany.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HAYLEY HOUR BY HOUR]\r\n\r\nMrs. Opie, the novelist, who stayed with Mr. Hayley every summer, and\r\nalso served as a magnet to devout sojourners at Bognor, has left an\r\naccount of the poet's habits which is vastly more entertaining than his\r\npoetry. He rose at six or earlier and at once composed some devotional\r\nverse. At breakfast, he read to Mrs. Opie; afterwards Mrs. Opie read to\r\nhim. At eleven they drank coffee, and before he dressed for dinner, a\r\nvery temperate meal, Mrs. Opie sang. After dinner there was more reading\r\naloud, the matter being either manuscript compositions of Mr. Hayley's,\r\nor modern publications. Mr. Hayley took cocoa and Mrs. Opie tea, and\r\nafterwards Mrs. Opie read aloud or sang. At nine, the servants came to\r\nprayers, which were original compositions of Mr. Hayley's, read by him\r\nin a very impressive manner, and before bed, Mrs. Opie sang one of Mr.\r\nHayley's hymns.\r\n\r\nHayley's grave is at Felpham, and his epitaph by Mrs. Opie may be read\r\nby the industrious on the wall of the church. Among the many epitaphs on\r\nhis neighbours by Hayley himself, who had a special knack of mortuary\r\nverse, is this on a Felpham blacksmith:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     My sledge and hammer lie reclined;\r\n     My bellows too have lost their wind;\r\n     My fire's extinct; my forge decay'd,\r\n     And in the dust my vice is laid;\r\n     My coal is spent, my iron gone;\r\n     The nails are driven--my work is done.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last verses that Hayley wrote have more charm and delicacy than\r\nperhaps anything else among his works:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Ye gentle birds that perch aloof,\r\n     And smooth your pinions on my roof,\r\n     Preparing for departure hence\r\n     Ere winter's angry threats commence;\r\n     Like you, my soul would smooth her plume\r\n     For longer flights beyond the tomb.\r\n\r\n     May God, by whom is seen and heard\r\n     Departing man and wandering bird,\r\n     In mercy mark us for his own,\r\n     And guide us to the land unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A FAIRY'S FUNERAL]\r\n\r\nBut it is not Hayley that gives its glory to Felpham. The glory of\r\nFelpham is that William Blake was happy there for nearly three years. It\r\nwas at Felpham that he saw the fairy's funeral. \"Did you ever see a\r\nfairy's funeral, ma'am?\" he asked a visitor. \"Never, sir!\" \"I have!... I\r\nwas walking alone in my garden; there was great stillness among the\r\nbranches and flowers, and more than common sweetness in the air; I heard\r\na low and pleasant sound, and I knew not whence it came. At last I saw\r\nthe broad leaf of a flower move, and underneath I saw a procession of\r\ncreatures, of the size and colour of green and grey grasshoppers,\r\nbearing a body laid out on a rose-leaf, which they buried with songs,\r\nand then disappeared. It was a fairy's funeral!\"\r\n\r\nBlake settled at Felpham to be near Hayley, for whom he had a number of\r\ncommissions to execute. He engraved illustrations to Hayley's works,\r\nand painted eighteen heads for Hayley's library--among them,\r\nShakespeare, Homer, and Hayley himself; but all have vanished, the\r\npresent owner knows not where.\r\n\r\nIn some verses which Blake addressed to Anna Flaxman, the wife of the\r\nsculptor, in September, 1800, a few days before moving from London to\r\nthe Sussex coast, he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     This song to the flower of Flaxman's joy;\r\n     To the blossom of hope, for a sweet decoy;\r\n     Do all that you can and all that you may\r\n     To entice him to Felpham and far away.\r\n\r\n     Away to sweet Felpham, for Heaven is there;\r\n     The ladder of Angels descends through the air,\r\n     On the turret its spiral does softly descend,\r\n     Through the village then winds, at my cot it does end.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PROPHETS AT FELPHAM]\r\n\r\nBlake's house still stands, a retired, thatched cottage, facing the sea,\r\nbut some distance from it. In a letter to Flaxman a little later, he\r\nsays, \"Felpham is a sweet place for study, because it is more spiritual\r\nthan London. Heaven opens here on all sides its golden gates; the\r\nwindows are not obstructed by vapours; voices of celestial inhabitants\r\nare more distinctly heard, their forms more distinctly seen; and my\r\ncottage is also a shadow of their houses.\" Beside the sea Blake communed\r\nwith the spirits of Dante and Homer, Milton and the Hebrew Prophets.\r\n\r\nBlake's sojourn at Felpham ended in 1803. A grotesque and annoying\r\nincident marred its close, the story of which, as told by the poet in a\r\nletter to Mr. Butler, certainly belongs to the history of Sussex. It\r\nshould, however, first be stated that an ex-soldier in the Royal\r\nDragoons, named John Scholfield, had accused Blake of uttering seditious\r\nwords. The letter runs:--\"His enmity arises from my having turned him\r\nout of my garden, into which he was invited as an assistant by a\r\ngardener at work therein, without my knowledge that he was so invited. I\r\ndesired him, as politely as possible, to go out of the garden; he made\r\nme an impertinent answer. I insisted on his leaving the garden; he\r\nrefused. I still persisted in desiring his departure. He then threatened\r\nto knock out my eyes, with many abominable imprecations, and with some\r\ncontempt for my person; it affronted my foolish pride. I therefore took\r\nhim by the elbows, and pushed him before me until I had got him out.\r\nThere I intended to have left him; but he, turning about, put himself\r\ninto a posture of defiance, threatening and swearing at me. I, perhaps\r\nfoolishly and perhaps not, stepped out at the gate, and, putting aside\r\nhis blows, took him again by the elbows, and, keeping his back to me,\r\npushed him forward down the road about fifty yards--he all the while\r\nendeavouring to turn round and strike me, and raging and cursing, which\r\ndrew out several neighbours. At length when I had got him to where he\r\nwas quartered, which was very quickly done, we were met at the gate by\r\nthe master of the house--the Fox Inn--(who is the proprietor of my\r\ncottage) and his wife and daughter, and the man's comrade, and several\r\nother people. My landlord compelled the soldiers to go indoors, after\r\nmany abusive threats against me and my wife from the two soldiers; but\r\nnot one word of threat on account of sedition was uttered at that time.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WILLIAM BLAKE, TRAITOR]\r\n\r\nAs a result, Blake was haled before the magistrates and committed for\r\ntrial. The trial was held in the Guildhall at Chichester, on January\r\n11th, 1804. Hayley, in spite of having been thrown from his horse on a\r\nflint with, says Gilchrist, Blake's biographer, \"more than usual\r\nviolence\" was in attendance to swear to the poet's character, and\r\nCowper's friend Rose, a clever barrister, had been retained. According\r\nto the report in the County paper, \"William Blake, an engraver at\r\nFelpham, was tried on a charge exhibited against him by two soldiers for\r\nhaving uttered seditious and treasonable expressions, such as 'd--n the\r\nking, d--n all his subjects, d--n his soldiers, they are all slaves;\r\nwhen Buonaparte comes, it will be cut-throat for cut-throat, and the\r\nweakest must go to the wall; I will help him; &c., &c.'\" Blake\r\nelectrified the court by calling out \"False!\" in the midst of the\r\nmilitary evidence, the invented character of which was, however, so\r\nobvious that an acquittal resulted. \"In defiance of all decency,\" the\r\nspectators cheered, and Hayley carried off the sturdy Republican (as he\r\nwas at heart) to Mid Lavant, to sup at Mrs. Poole's.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BLAKE'S FLASHING EYE]\r\n\r\nMr. Gilchrist found an old fellow who had been present at the trial,\r\ndrawn thither by the promise of seeing the great man of the\r\nneighbourhood, Mr. Hayley. All that he could remember was Blake's\r\nflashing eye.\r\n\r\nThe Fox Inn, by the way, is still as it was, but the custom, I fancy,\r\ngoes more to the Thatched House, which adds to the charms of refreshment\r\na museum containing such treasures as a petrified cocoanut, the skeleton\r\nof a lobster twenty-eight years old, and a representation of Moses in\r\nthe bulrushes.\r\n\r\nA third and fourth great man, of a different type both from Hayley and\r\nBlake, met at Felpham in 1819. One was Cyril Jackson, Dean of Christ\r\nChurch, who, lying on his death-bed in the Manor House, was visited by\r\nthe other--his old pupil, the First Gentleman in Europe.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] The Sussex provincial name for the whimbrel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Arundel._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nARUNDEL AND NEIGHBOURHOOD\r\n\r\n     A feudal town--Castles ruined and habitable--The old religion and\r\n     the new--Bevis of Southampton--Lord Thurlow lays an egg--A noble\r\n     park--A song in praise of Sussex--The father of cricket.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeen from the river or from the east side of the Arun valley, Arundel is\r\nthe most imposing town in Sussex. Many are larger, many are equally old,\r\nor older; but none wears so unusual and interesting an air, not even\r\nLewes among her Downs.\r\n\r\nArundel clings to the side of a shaggy hill above the Arun. Castle,\r\ncathedral, church--these are Arundel; the town itself is secondary,\r\nsubordinate, feudal. The castle is what one likes a castle to be--a mass\r\nof battlemented stone, with a keep, a gateway, and a history, and yet\r\nmore habitable than ever. So many of the rich make no effort to live in\r\ntheir ancestral halls; and what might be a home, carrying on the\r\ntradition of ages, is so often only a mere show, that to find an\r\nhistoric castle like Arundel still lived in is very gratifying. In\r\nSussex alone are several half-ruined houses that the builders could\r\nquickly make habitable once more. Arundel Castle, in spite of time and\r\nthe sieges of 1102, 1139, and 1643, is both comfortable and modern;\r\nArundel still depends for her life upon the complaisance of her\r\nover-lord.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MODERN MEDIEVALISM]\r\n\r\nI know of no town with so low a pulse as this precipitous little\r\nsettlement under the shadow of Rome and the Duke. In spite of picnic\r\nparties in the park, in spite of anglers from London, in spite of the\r\nrailway in the valley, Arundel is still medieval and curiously foreign.\r\nOn a very hot day, as one climbs the hill to the cathedral, one might be\r\nin old France, and certainly in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nTime's revenges have had their play in this town. Although the church is\r\nstill bravely of the establishment, half of it is closed to the Anglican\r\nvisitor (the chancel having been adjudged the private property of the\r\nDukes of Norfolk), and the once dominating position of the edifice has\r\nbeen impaired by the proximity of the new Roman Catholic church of St.\r\nPhilip Neri, which the present Duke has been building these many years.\r\nWithin, it is finished, a very charming and delicate feat in stone; but\r\nthe spire has yet to come. The old Irish soldier, humorous and\r\nbemedalled, who keeps watch and ward over the fane, is not the least of\r\nits merits.\r\n\r\nAlthough the chancel of the parish church has been closed, permission to\r\nenter may occasionally be obtained. It is rich in family tombs of great\r\ninterest and beauty, including that of the nineteenth Earl of Arundel,\r\nthe patron of William Caxton. In the siege of Arundel Castle in 1643,\r\nthe soldiers of the parliamentarians, under Sir William Waller, fired\r\ntheir cannon from the church tower. They also turned the church into a\r\nbarracks, and injured much stone work beyond repair. A fire beacon\r\nblazed of old on the spire to serve as a mark for vessels entering\r\nLittlehampton harbour.\r\n\r\nBevis of Southampton, the giant who, when he visited the Isle of Wight,\r\nwaded thither, was a warder at Arundel Castle; where he ate a whole ox\r\nevery week with bread and mustard, and drank two hogsheads of beer.\r\nHence \"Bevis Tower.\" His sword Morglay is still to be seen in the\r\narmoury of the castle; his bones lie beneath a mound in the park; and\r\nthe town was named after his horse. So runs a pretty story, which is,\r\nhowever, demolished with the ruthlessness that comes so easily to the\r\nantiquary and philologist. Bevis Tower, science declares, was named\r\nprobably after another Bevis--there was one at the Battle of Lewes, who\r\ntook prisoner Richard, King of the Romans, and was knighted for\r\nit--while Arundel is a corruption of \"hirondelle,\" a swallow. Mr. Lower\r\nmentions that in recent times in Sussex \"Swallow\" was a common name in\r\nstables, even for heavy dray horses. But before accepting finally the\r\nswallow theory, we ought to hear what Fuller has to say:--\"Some will\r\nhave it so named from _Arundel_ the _Horse_ of _Beavoice_, the great\r\n_Champion_. I confess it is not without precedence in _Antiquity_ for\r\n_Places_ to take _names_ from _Horses_, meeting with the _Promontory\r\nBucephalus_ in Peloponesus, where some report the _Horse_ of _Alexander_\r\nburied, and Bellonius will have it for the same cause called _Cavalla_\r\nat this day. But this _Castle_ was so called long before that _Imaginary\r\nHorse_ was _foled_, who cannot be fancied elder than his Master\r\nBeavoice, flourishing after the Conquest, long before which _Arundel_\r\nwas so called from the river _Arund_ running hard by it.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LORD THURLOW LAYS AN EGG]\r\n\r\nThe owls that once multiplied in the keep have now disappeared. They\r\nwere established there a hundred years or so ago by the eleventh Duke,\r\nand certain of them were known by the names of public men. \"Please, your\r\nGrace, Lord Thurlow has laid an egg,\" is an historic speech handed down\r\nby tradition. Lord Thurlow, the owl in question, died at a great age in\r\n1859.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Arun at North Stoke._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARUNDEL PARK]\r\n\r\nTo walk through Arundel Park is to receive a vivid impression of the\r\nsize and richness of our little isolated England. Two or three great\r\ntowns could be hidden in it unknown to each other. Valley succeeds to\r\nvalley; new herds of deer come into sight at almost every turn; as far\r\nas the eye can see the grass hills roll away. Those accustomed to parks\r\nwhose deer are always huddled close and whose wall is never distant, are\r\nbewildered by the vastness of this enclosure. Yet one has also the\r\nfeeling that such magnificence is right: to so lovely a word as Arundel,\r\nto the Premier Duke and Hereditary Earl Marshal of England, should\r\nfittingly fall this far-spreading and comely pleasaunce. Had Arundel\r\nPark been small and empty of deer what a blunder it would be.\r\n\r\nWalking west of Arundel through the vast Rewell Wood, we come suddenly\r\nupon Punch-bowl Green, and open a great green valley, dominated by the\r\nwhite façade of Dale Park House, below Madehurst, one of the most remote\r\nof Sussex villages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SLINDON]\r\n\r\nBy keeping due west for another mile Slindon is reached. This village is\r\none of the Sussex backwaters, as one might say. It lies on no road that\r\nany one ever travels except for the purpose of going to Slindon or\r\ncoming from it; and those that perform either of these actions are few.\r\nYet all who have not seen Slindon are by so much the poorer, for Slindon\r\nHouse is nobly Elizabethan, with fine pictures and hiding-places, and\r\nSlindon beeches are among the aristocracy of trees. And here I should\r\nlike to quote a Sussex poem of haunting wistfulness and charm, which was\r\nwritten by Mr. Hilaire Belloc, who once walked to Rome and is an old\r\ndweller at Slindon:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A SOUTH COUNTRY SONG]\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE SOUTH COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n     When I am living in the Midlands,\r\n       That are sodden and unkind,\r\n     I light my lamp in the evening:\r\n       My work is left behind;\r\n     And the great hills of the South Country\r\n       Come back into my mind.\r\n\r\n     The great hills of the South Country\r\n       They stand along the sea:\r\n     And it's there walking in the high woods\r\n       That I could wish to be,\r\n     And the men that were boys when I was a boy\r\n       Walking along with me.\r\n\r\n     The men that live in North England\r\n       I saw them for a day:\r\n     Their hearts are set upon the waste fells,\r\n       Their skies are fast and grey:\r\n     From their castle-walls a man may see\r\n       The mountains far away.\r\n\r\n     The men that live in West England\r\n       They see the Severn strong,\r\n     A-rolling on rough water brown\r\n       Light aspen leaves along.\r\n     They have the secret of the Rocks,\r\n       And the oldest kind of song.\r\n\r\n     But the men that live in the South Country\r\n       Are the kindest and most wise,\r\n     They get their laughter from the loud surf,\r\n       And the faith in their happy eyes\r\n     Comes surely from our Sister the Spring,\r\n       When over the sea she flies;\r\n     The violets suddenly bloom at her feet,\r\n       She blesses us with surprise.\r\n\r\n     I never get between the pines,\r\n       But I smell the Sussex air,\r\n     Nor I never come on a belt of sand\r\n       But my home is there;\r\n     And along the sky the line of the Downs\r\n       So noble and so bare.\r\n\r\n     A lost thing could I never find,\r\n       Nor a broken thing mend;\r\n     And I fear I shall be all alone\r\n       When I get towards the end.\r\n     Who will there be to comfort me,\r\n       Or who will be my friend?\r\n\r\n     I will gather and carefully make my friends\r\n       Of the men of the Sussex Weald,\r\n     They watch the stars from silent folds,\r\n       They stiffly plough the field.\r\n     By them and the God of the South Country\r\n       My poor soul shall be healed.\r\n\r\n     If I ever become a rich man,\r\n       Or if ever I grow to be old,\r\n     I will build a house with deep thatch\r\n       To shelter me from the cold,\r\n     And there shall the Sussex songs be sung\r\n       And the story of Sussex told.\r\n\r\n     I will hold my house in the high wood\r\n       Within a walk of the sea,\r\n     And the men who were boys when I was a boy\r\n       Shall sit and drink with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NEWLAND, NYREN, AND SILVER BILLY]\r\n\r\nRichard Newland, the father of serious cricket, came from this parish.\r\nHe was born in 1718, or thereabouts, and in 1745 he made 88 for England\r\nagainst Kent. He was left-handed, and the finest bat ever seen in those\r\ndays. He taught Richard Nyren, of Hambledon, all the skill and judgment\r\nthat that noble general possessed; Nyren communicated his knowledge to\r\nthe Hambledon eleven, and the game was made. An interest in historical\r\nveracity compels me to add that William Beldham--Silver Billy--talking\r\nto Mr. Pycroft, discounted some of Nyren's praise. \"Cricket,\" he said,\r\n\"was played in Sussex very early, before my day at least [he was born in\r\n1766]; but that there was no good play I know by this, that Richard\r\nNewland, of Slindon in Sussex, as you say, sir, taught old Richard\r\nNyren, and that no Sussex man could be found to play Newland. Now a\r\nsecond-rate man of our parish beat Newland easily; so you may judge what\r\nthe rest of Sussex then were.\" But this is disregarding the\r\ncharacteristic uncertainty of the game.\r\n\r\nIf one would spend a day far from mankind, on high ground, there is no\r\nbetter way than to walk from Arundel through Houghton Forest (where, as\r\nwe have seen, Charles II. avoided the Governor) to Cocking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nLITTLEHAMPTON\r\n\r\n     A children's paradise--Wind-swept villages--Cary and\r\n     Coleridge--Sussex folklore--Climping--Richard Jefferies and\r\n     Sussex--John Taylor the Water Poet--Highdown Hill--A miller in love\r\n     with death--A digression on mills and millers--Treason at\r\n     Patching--A wife in a thousand--A Sussex truffler--The Palmer\r\n     triplets.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittlehampton is favoured in having both sea and river. It also has\r\nlawns between the houses and the beach, as at Dieppe, and is as nearly a\r\nchildren's paradise as exists. The sea at low tide recedes almost beyond\r\nthe reach of the ordinary paddler, which is as it should be except for\r\nthose that would swim. A harbour, a pier, a lighthouse, a windmill--all\r\nthese are within a few yards of each other. On the neighbouring beach,\r\nspringing from the stones, you find the yellow-horned poppy, beautiful\r\nboth in flower and leaf, and the delicate tamarisk makes a natural hedge\r\nparallel with the sea, to Worthing on the one side, and to Bognor on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe little villages in the flats behind the eastern tamarisk\r\nhedge--Rustington, Preston, Ferring, are, in summer, veritable sun\r\ntraps, with their white walls dazzling in radiance. Such trees as grow\r\nabout here all bow to the north-east, bent to that posture by the\r\nprevailing south-west winds. A Sussex man, on the hills or south of\r\nthem, lost at night, has but to ascertain the outline of a tree, and he\r\nmay get his bearings. If he cannot see so much as that he has but to\r\nfeel the bark for lichen, which grows on the north east, or lee, side.\r\n\r\nIt was at Littlehampton in September, 1817, that Coleridge met Cary, the\r\ntranslator of Dante. Cary was walking on the beach, reciting Homer to\r\nhis son. Up came a noticeable man with large grey eyes: \"Sir, yours is a\r\nface I should know. I am Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A CHURCH DUEL]\r\n\r\nThe county paper for February 27, 1796, has this paragraph: \"On Monday\r\nlast a duel was fought betwixt Mr. R----n and Lieut. B----y, both of\r\nLittlehampton, in a field near that place, which, after the discharge of\r\neach a pistol, terminated without bloodshed. The dispute, we understand,\r\noriginated about a pew in the parish church.\"\r\n\r\nA local proverb says that if you eat winkles in March it is as good as a\r\ndose of medicine; which reminds me that Sussex has many wise sayings of\r\nits own. Here is a piece of Sussex counsel in connection with the\r\nroaring month:--\r\n\r\n\r\n               If from fleas you would be free,\r\n     On the first of March let all your windows closed be.\r\n\r\n\r\nI quote two other rhymes:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     If you would wish your bees to thrive\r\n     Gold must be paid for every hive;\r\n     For when they're bought with other money\r\n     There will be neither swarm nor honey.\r\n\r\n     The first butterfly you see,\r\n     Cut off his head across your knee,\r\n     Bury the head under a stone\r\n     And a lot of money will be your own.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Whit Sunday the devout Sussex man eats roast veal and gooseberry\r\npudding. A Sussex child born on Sunday can neither be hanged nor\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"CLIMPING FOR PERFECTION\"]\r\n\r\nWest of Littlehampton is an architectural treasure, in the shape of\r\nClimping church, which no one should miss. The way is over the ferry and\r\nalong the road to the first signboard, when one strikes northward\r\ntowards Ford, and comes suddenly upon this squat and solid fane. A Saxon\r\nchurch stood here, built by the Prioress of Leominster, before the\r\nConquest: to Roger de Montgomerie was the manor given by the Conqueror,\r\nas part of the earldom of Arundel and Chichester, together with\r\nAtherington manor, much of which is now, like Selsey's park, under the\r\nChannel. De Montgomerie gave Climping manor to the nuns of Almanesches,\r\nby whom the present Norman fortress-tower (with walls 4-1/4 feet thick)\r\nwas added, and in 1253 John de Climping, the vicar, rebuilt the\r\nremainder. The church is thus six and a half centuries old, and parts of\r\nit are older. \"Bosham, for antiquity; Boxgrove, for beauty; and\r\nClimping, for perfection\" is the dictum of an antiquary quoted by the\r\npresent vicar in a little pamphlet-history of his parish. As regards the\r\nNorman doorway, at any rate, he is right: there is nothing in Sussex to\r\nexcel that; while in general architectural attraction the building is of\r\nthe richest. It is also a curiously homely and ingratiating church.\r\n\r\nOne of the new windows, representing St. Paul, has a peculiar interest,\r\nas the vicar tells us:--\"St. Paul was a prisoner at Rome shortly after\r\nCaractacus, the British Chief, whose daughter, Claudia, married Pudens,\r\nboth friends of the Apostle (2 Tim. iv. 21). Pudens afterwards commanded\r\nthe Roman soldiers stationed at Regnum (Chichester), and if St. Paul\r\ncame to Britain, at Claudia's request (as ancient writers testify), he\r\ncertainly would visit Sussex. How close this brings us here in Sussex to\r\nthe Bible story!\"\r\n\r\nAt Baylies Court, now a farmhouse, the Benedictine monks of Seez, also\r\nprotégés of Robert de Montgomerie, had their chapel, remains of which\r\nare still to be seen.\r\n\r\nClimping, which otherwise lives its own life, is the resort of golfers\r\n(who to the vicar's regret play all Sunday and turn Easter Day into \"a\r\nHeathen Festival\") and of the sportsmen of the Sussex Coursing Club, who\r\nfind that the terrified Climping hare gives satisfaction beyond most in\r\nthe county.\r\n\r\nOf Ford, north of Climping, there is nothing to say, except that popular\r\nrumour has it that its minute and uninteresting church (the antithesis\r\nof Climping) was found one day by accident in a bed of nettles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JEFFERIES IN SUSSEX]\r\n\r\nA good eastern walk from Littlehampton takes one by the sea to Goring,\r\nand then inland over Highdown Hill to Angmering, and so to Littlehampton\r\nagain or to Arundel, our present centre. Goring touches literature in\r\ntwo places. The great house was built by Sir Bysshe Shelley, grandfather\r\nof the poet; and in the village died, in 1887, Richard Jefferies, author\r\nof _The Story of My Heart_, after a life of ill-health spent in the\r\nservice of nature. Many beautiful and sympathetic descriptions of Sussex\r\nare scattered about in Jefferies' books of essays, notably, \"To\r\nBrighton,\" \"The South Down Shepherd,\" and \"The Breeze on Beachy Head\" in\r\n_Nature near London_; \"Clematis Lane,\" \"Nature near Brighton,\" \"Sea, Sky\r\nand Down,\" and \"January in the Sussex Woods\" in _The Life of the\r\nFields_; \"Sunny Brighton\" in _The Open Air_, and \"The Country-Side,\r\nSussex\" and \"Buckhurst Park\" in _Field and Hedgerow_. Jefferies had a\r\nway of blending experiences and concealing the names of places, which\r\nmakes it difficult to know exactly what part of Sussex he is describing;\r\nbut I think I could lead anyone to Clematis Lane. I might, by the way,\r\nhave remarked of South Harting that the luxuriance of the clematis in\r\nits hedges is unsurpassed.\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor, the water poet, has a doggerel narrative entitled \"A New\r\nDiscovery by Sea with a Wherry from London to Salisbury,\" 1623, wherein\r\nhe mentions a woful night with fleas at Goring, and pens a couplet\r\nworthy to take a place with the famous description of a similar\r\nvisitation in _Eothen_:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Who in their fury nip'd and skip'd so hotly,\r\n     That all our skins were almost turned to motley.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JOHN TAYLOR AND THE CONSTABLE]\r\n\r\nTaylor gives us in the same record a pleasant picture of the Sussex\r\nconstable in 1623:--\r\n\r\n\r\n       The night before a Constable there came,\r\n     Who asked my trade, my dwelling, and my name,\r\n     My businesse, and a troupe of questions more,\r\n     And wherefore we did land vpon that shore?\r\n     To whom I fram'd my answers true and fit,\r\n     (According to his plenteous want of wit)\r\n     But were my words all true or if I ly'd\r\n     With neither I could get him satisfi'd.\r\n     He ask'd if we were Pyrats? We said No,\r\n     (_As if we had we would haue told him so_)\r\n     He said that Lords sometimes would enterprise\r\n     T' escape and leaue the Kingdome in disguise:\r\n     But I assur'd him on my honest word\r\n     That I was no disguisèd Knight or Lord.\r\n     He told me then that I must goe sixe miles\r\n     T' a Justice there, Sir John or else Sir Giles:\r\n     I told him I was lothe to goe so farre,\r\n     And he told me he would my journey barre.\r\n     Thus what with Fleas and with the seuerall prates\r\n     Of th' officer, and his _Ass_-sociats\r\n     We arose to goe, but Fortune bade us stay:\r\n     The Constable had stolne our oares away,\r\n     And borne them thence a quarter of a mile\r\n     Quite through a Lane beyond a gate and stile;\r\n     And hid them there to hinder my depart,\r\n     For which I wish'd him hang'd with all my heart.\r\n     A plowman (for us) found our Oares againe,\r\n     Within a field well fil'd with Barley Graine.\r\n       Then madly, gladly, out to sea we thrust,\r\n     'Gainst windes and stormes, and many a churlish Gust,\r\n     By _Kingston_ Chappelle and by _Rushington_,\r\n     By _Little-Hampton_ and by _Middleton_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MILLER AND SWEET DEATH]\r\n\r\nHighdown, above Goring, is a good hill in itself, conical in shape, as a\r\nhill should be according to the exacting ideas of childhood, with a\r\nsweeping view of the coast and the Channel; but its fame as a resort of\r\nholiday makers comes less from its position and height than from the\r\ncircumstance that John Oliver is buried upon it. John Oliver was the\r\nmiller of Highdown Hill. When not grinding corn he seems to have busied\r\nhimself with thoughts upon the necessary end of all things, to such an\r\nextent that his meditations on the subject gradually became a mania.\r\nHis coffin was made while he was still a young man, and it remained\r\nunder his bed until its time was ripe, fitted--to bring it to a point of\r\npreparedness unusual even with the Chinese, those masters of\r\nanticipatory obsequies--with wheels, which the miller, I doubt not,\r\nregularly oiled. John Oliver did not stop there. Having his coffin\r\ncomfortably at hand, he proceeded to erect his tomb. This was built in\r\n1766, with tedious verses upon it from the miller's pen; while in an\r\nalcove near the tomb was a mechanical arrangement of death's-heads which\r\nmight keep the miller's thoughts from straying, when, as with Dr.\r\nJohnson's philosopher, cheerfulness would creep in.\r\n\r\nThe miller lived in the company of his coffin, his tomb, and his\r\n_mementi mori_, until 1793, when at the age of eighty-four his hopes\r\nwere realised. Those who love death die old.\r\n\r\nBetween two and three thousand persons attended the funeral; no one was\r\npermitted to wear any but gay clothes; and the funeral sermon was read\r\nby a little girl of twelve, from the text, Micah vii. 8, 9.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A DIGRESSION ON MILLS]\r\n\r\nThe mill of John Oliver has vanished, nothing but a depression in the\r\nturf now indicating where its foundations stood. Too many Sussex\r\nwindmills have disappeared. Clayton still has her twain, landmarks for\r\nmany miles--I have seen them on exceptionally clear days from the\r\nKentish hills--and other windmills are scattered over the county; but\r\nmany more than now exist have ceased to be, victims of the power of\r\nsteam. There is probably no contrast æsthetically more to the\r\ndisadvantage of the modern substitute than that of the steam mill of\r\nto-day with the windmill of yesterday. The steam mill is always ugly,\r\nalways dusty, always noisy, usually in a town. The windmill stands high\r\nand white, a thing of life and radiance and delicate beauty, surrounded\r\nby grass, in communion with the heavens. Such noise as it has is\r\nelemental, justifiable, like a ship's cordage in a gale. No one would\r\npaint a steam mill; a picture with a windmill can hardly be a failure.\r\nConstable, who knew everything about the magic of windmills, painted\r\nseveral in Sussex--one even at Brighton.\r\n\r\nBrighton now has but one mill. There used to be many: one in the West\r\nHill road, a comelier landmark than the stucco Congregational tower that\r\nhas taken its place close by and serves as the town's sentinel from\r\nalmost every point of approach. In 1797 a miller near Brighton\r\nanticipated American enterprise by moving his mill bodily to a place two\r\nmiles distant by the help of eighty oxen.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness of steam mills is that they are apparently without\r\nmillers--at least there is no unmistakable dominating presence in a\r\nwhite hat, to whom one can confidently apply the definite article, as in\r\nthe mill on the hill. Millers' men there are in plenty, but the miller\r\nis lacking. This is because steam mills belong to companies. Thus, with\r\nthe passing of the windmill we lose also the miller, that notable figure\r\nin English life and tradition; always jolly, if the old songs are true;\r\noften eccentric, as the story of John Oliver has shown; and usually a\r\ncharacter, as becomes one who lives by the four winds, or by water--for\r\nthe miller of tradition was often found in a water-mill too. The\r\nwater-miller's empire has been threatened less than that of the\r\nwindmill, for there is no sudden cessation of water power as of wind\r\npower. Sussex still has many water-mills--cool and splashing homes of\r\npeaceful bustle. Long may they endure.\r\n\r\nHighdown Hill has other associations. In 1812 the Gentlemen of the Weald\r\nmet the Gentlemen of the Sea-coast at cricket on its dividing summit.\r\nThe game, which was for one hundred guineas, was a very close thing, the\r\nGentlemen of the Weald winning by only seven runs. Among the Gentlemen\r\nof the Sea-coast was Mr. Osbaldeston, while the principal Gentleman of\r\nthe Weald was Mr. E. H. Budd.\r\n\r\nA mile north of Highdown Hill, in a thickly wooded country, are Patching\r\nand Clapham; Patching celebrated for its pond, which washes the\r\nhigh-road to Arundel, and Clapham for its woods. Three hundred and more\r\nyears ago Patching Copse was the scene of a treasonable meeting between\r\nWilliam Shelley, an ancestor of the poet, one branch of whose family\r\nlong held Michelgrove (where Henry VIII. was entertained by our\r\nplotter's grandfather), and Charles Paget: sturdy Roman Catholics both,\r\nwho thus sought each other out, on the night of September 16, 1583, to\r\nconfer as to the possibility of invading England, deposing Elizabeth,\r\nand setting Mary Queen of Scots upon the throne. Nothing came of the\r\nplot save the imprisonment of Shelley (who was condemned to death but\r\nescaped the sentence) and the flight of Paget, to hatch further treason\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PERFECT WIFE]\r\n\r\nThe last Shelley to hold Michelgrove, now no more, was Sir John, who,\r\nafter it had been in the family for three hundred and fifty years, sold\r\nit in 1800. This was the Sir John Shelley who composed the following\r\nepitaph in Clapham church (one of Sir Gilbert Scott's restorations) to\r\ncommemorate the very remarkable virtues of his lady--untimely snatched\r\nfrom his side:--\r\n\r\n\r\n           Here Lyeth the Body of Wilhelmina Shelley\r\n         who departed this Life the 21st of March 1772\r\n                   Aged Twenty three years.\r\n\r\n          She was a pattern for the World to follow:\r\n  Such a being both in form and mind perhaps never existed before.\r\n        A most dutiful, affectionate, and Virtuous Wife,\r\n              A most tender and Anxious parent,\r\n              A most sincere and constant Friend,\r\n            A most amiable and elegant companion;\r\n          Universally Benevolent, generous, and humane;\r\n                   The Pride of her own Sex,\r\n                    The admiration of ours.\r\n           She lived universally belov'd, and admir'd\r\n          She died as generally rever'd, and regretted,\r\n    A loss felt by all who had the happiness of knowing Her,\r\nBy none to be compar'd to _that_ of her disconsolate, affectionate, Loving,\r\n         & in this World everlastingly Miserable Husband,\r\n                       Sir JOHN SHELLEY,\r\n          Who has caused this inscription to be Engrav'd.\r\n\r\n\r\nHorsfield tells us that \"the beechwoods in this parish [Patching] and\r\nits immediate neighbourhood are very productive of the Truffle\r\n(_Lycoperdon tuber_). About forty years ago William Leach came from the\r\nWest Indies, with some hogs accustomed to hunt for truffles, and\r\nproceeding along the coast from the Land's End, in Cornwall, to the\r\nmouth of the River Thames, determined to fix on that spot where he found\r\nthem most abundant. He took four years to try the experiment, and at\r\nlength settled in this parish, where he carried on the business of\r\ntruffle-hunter till his death.\"\r\n\r\nAngmering, which we may take on our return to Arundel, is a typically\r\ndusty Sussex village, with white houses and thatched roofs, and a rather\r\nfiner church than most. On our way back to Arundel, in the middle of a\r\nwood, a little more than a mile from Angmering, to the west, we come\r\nupon an interesting relic of a day when tables bore nobler loads than\r\nnow they do: a decoy pond formed originally to supply wild duck to the\r\nkitchen of Arundel Castle, but now no longer used. The long tapering\r\ntunnels of wire netting, into which the tame ducks of the decoy lured\r\ntheir wild cousins, are still in place, although the wire has largely\r\nperished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PALMER TRIPLETS]\r\n\r\nAt an old house near the Decoy (now converted into cottages), which any\r\nnative will gladly and amusedly point out, lived, in the reign of Henry\r\nVIII., Lady Palmer, the famous mother of the Palmer triplets, who were\r\ndistinguished from other triplets, not only by being born each on a\r\nsuccessive Sunday but by receiving each the honour of knighthood. The\r\ncurious circumstances of their birth seem to be well attested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gateway, Amberley Castle._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nAMBERLEY AND PARHAM\r\n\r\n     Sussex fish--A straw-blown village--A painter of Sussex light--A\r\n     castle only in name--Parham's treasures--The Parham\r\n     heronry--Storrington and the sagacious Jack Pudding--A Sussex\r\n     audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUSSEX FISH]\r\n\r\nFive miles to the north of Arundel by road (over the Arun at Houghton's\r\nancient bridge, restored by the bishops of Chichester in the fifteenth\r\ncentury), and a few minutes by rail, is Amberley, the fishing metropolis\r\nof Sussex, where, every Sunday in the season, London anglers meet to\r\ndrop their lines in friendly rivalry. \"Amerley trout\" (as Walton calls\r\nthem) and Arundel mullet are the best of the Arun's treasures; and this\r\nreminds me of Fuller's tribute to Sussex fish, which may well be quoted\r\nin this watery neighbourhood: \"Now, as this County is eminent for both\r\n_Sea_ and _River-_fish, namely, an _Arundel Mullet_, a _Chichester\r\nLobster_, a _Shelsey Cockle_, and an _Amerly Trout_; so _Sussex_\r\naboundeth with more _Carpes_ than any other of this Nation. And though\r\nnot so great as _Jovius_ reporteth to be found in the _Lurian Lake_ in\r\n_Italy_, weighing more than fifty pounds, yet those generally of great\r\nand goodly proportion. I need not adde, that _Physicians_ account the\r\ngalls of _Carpes_, as also a stone in their heads, to be _Medicinable_;\r\nonly I will observe that, because _Jews_ will not eat _Caviare_ made of\r\n_Sturgeon_ (because coming from a fish wanting Scales, and therefore\r\nforbidden in the _Levitical Law_); therefore the _Italians_ make greater\r\nprofit of the _Spaun_ of _Carps_, whereof they make a _Red Caviare_,\r\nwell pleasing the _Jews_ both in _Palate_ and _Conscience_. All I will\r\nadde of _Carps_ is this, that _Ramus_ himself doth not so much redound\r\nin _Dichotomies_ as they do; seeing no one bone is to be found in their\r\nbody, which is not _forked_ or divided into two parts at the end\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\nAmberley proper, as distinguished from Amberley of the anglers, is a\r\nmile from the station and is built on a ridge. The castle is the extreme\r\nwestern end of this ridge, the north side of which descends\r\nprecipitously to the marshy plain that extends as far as Pulborough.\r\nStanding on the castle one sees Pulborough church due north--height\r\ncalling unto height. The castle is now a farm; indeed, all Amberley is a\r\nhuge stockyard, smelling of straw and cattle. It is sheer Sussex--chalky\r\nsoil, whitewashed cottages, huge waggons; and one of the best of Sussex\r\npainters, and, in his exquisite modest way, of all painters living,\r\ndwells in the heart of it--Edward Stott, who year after year shows\r\nLondon connoisseurs how the clear skin of the Sussex boy takes the\r\nevening light; and how the Southdown sheep drink at hill ponds beneath a\r\nviolet sky; and that there is nothing more beautiful under the stars\r\nthan a whitewashed cottage just when the lamp is lit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AMBERLEY AND PARHAM]\r\n\r\nAmberley has no right to lay claim to a castle, for the old ruins are\r\nnot truly, as they seem, the remains of a castellated stronghold, but\r\nof a crenellated mansion. John Langton, Bishop of Chichester in the\r\nfourteenth century, was the first builder. Previously the Church lands\r\nhere had been held very jealously, and in 1200 we find Bishop Gilbert de\r\nLeofard twice excommunicating, and as often absolving, the Earl of\r\nArundel for poaching (as he termed it) in Houghton Forest. The Church\r\nlost Amberley in the sixteenth century. William Rede, who succeeded\r\nLangton to both house and see, wishing to feel secure in his home,\r\ncraved permission to dig a moat around it and to render it both hostile\r\nand defensive. Hence its lion-like mien; but it has known no warfare,\r\nand the castle's mouldering walls now give what assistance they can in\r\nharbouring live stock. Twentieth-century sheds lean against\r\nfourteenth-century masonry; faggots are stored in the moat; lawn tennis\r\nis played in the courtyard; and black pigeons peep from the slits cut\r\nfor arquebusiers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Amberley Castle._]\r\n\r\nAmberley Castle only once intrudes itself in history: Charles II.,\r\nduring his flight in 1651, spent a night there under the protection of\r\nSir John Briscoe, as we saw in Chapter III.\r\n\r\nIn winter, if you ask an Amberley man where he dwells, he says,\r\n\"Amberley, God help us.\" In summer he says, \"Amberley--where _would_ you\r\nlive?\"\r\n\r\nFrom Amberley to Parham one keeps upon the narrow ridge for a mile or\r\nso, branching off then to the left. Parham's advance guard is seen all\r\nthe way--a clump of fir trees, indicating that the soil there changes to\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A NOBLE DAME]\r\n\r\nFor two possessions is Parham noted: a heronry in the park, and in the\r\nhouse a copy of Montaigne with Shakespeare's autograph in it. The house,\r\na spreading Tudor mansion, is the seat of Lord Zouche, a descendant of\r\nthe traveller, Robert Curzon, who wrote _The Monasteries of the Levant_,\r\nthat long, leisurely, and fascinating narrative of travel. In addition\r\nto Montaigne, it enshrines a priceless collection of armour, of\r\nincunabula and Eastern MSS. Among the pictures are full lengths of Sir\r\nPhilip Sidney and Lady Sidney, and that Penelope D'Arcy--one of Mr.\r\nHardy's \"Noble Dames\"--who promised to marry three suitors in turn and\r\ndid so. We see her again at Firle Place.\r\n\r\nA hiding hole for priests and other refugees is in the long gallery,\r\naccess to it being gained through a window seat. There was hidden\r\nCharles Paget after the Babington conspiracy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PARHAM HERONS]\r\n\r\nParham Park has deer and a lake and an enchanted forest of sombre trees.\r\nOn the highest ground in this forest is the clump of firs in which the\r\nfamous herons build. The most interesting time to visit the heronry is\r\nin the breeding season, for then one sees the lank birds continually\r\nhoming from the Amberley Wild Brooks with fishes in their bills and long\r\nlegs streaming behind. The noise is tremendous, beyond all rookeries.\r\nMr. Knox's _Ornithological Rambles_, from which I have already quoted\r\nfreely, has this passage: \"The herons at Parham assemble early in\r\nFebruary, and then set about repairing their nests, but the trees are\r\nnever entirely deserted during the winter months; a few birds, probably\r\nsome of the more backward of the preceding season, roosting among their\r\nboughs every night. They commence laying early in March, and the greater\r\npart of the young birds are hatched during the early days of April.\r\nAbout the end of May they may be seen to flap out of their nests to the\r\nadjacent boughs, and bask for hours in the warm sunshine; but although\r\nnow comparatively quiet during the day, they become clamorous for food\r\nas the evening approaches, and indeed for a long time appear to be more\r\ndifficult to wean, and less able to shift for themselves, than most\r\nbirds of a similar age. They may be observed, as late as August, still\r\non the trees, screaming for food, and occasionally fed by their parents,\r\nwho forage for them assiduously; indeed, these exertions, so far from\r\nbeing relaxed after the setting of the sun, appear to be redoubled\r\nduring the night; for I have frequently disturbed herons when riding by\r\nmoonlight among the low grounds near the river, where I have seldom seen\r\nthem during the day, and several cottagers in the neighbourhood of\r\nParham have assured me that their shrill cry may be heard at all hours\r\nof the night, during the summer season, as they fly to and fro overhead,\r\non their passage between the heronry and the open country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Amberley Castle, entrance to Churchyard._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MANY MIGRATIONS]\r\n\r\n\"The history or genealogy of the progenitors of this colony is\r\nremarkable. They were originally brought from Coity Castle, in Wales, by\r\nLord Leicester's steward, in James the First's time, to Penshurst, in\r\nKent, the seat of Lord de Lisle, where their descendants continued for\r\nmore than two hundred years; from thence they migrated to Michelgrove,\r\nabout seventy miles from Penshurst and eight from Parham; here they\r\nremained for nearly twenty years, until the proprietor of the estate\r\ndisposed of it to the late Duke of Norfolk, who, having purchased it,\r\nnot as a residence, but with the view of increasing the local property\r\nin the neighbourhood of Arundel, pulled down the house, and felled one\r\nor two of the trees on which the herons had constructed their nests. The\r\nmigration commenced immediately, but appears to have been gradual; for\r\nthree seasons elapsed before all the members of the heronry had found\r\ntheir way over the Downs to their new quarters in the fir-woods of\r\nParham. This occurred about seventeen years ago [written c. 1848].\"\r\n\r\nSussex, says Mr. Borrer, author of _The Birds of Sussex_, has two other\r\nlarge heronries--at Windmill Hill Place, near Hailsham, and Brede, near\r\nWinchelsea--and some smaller ones, one being at Molecomb, above\r\nGoodwood.\r\n\r\nBetsy's Oak in Parham Park is said to be so called because Queen\r\nElizabeth sat beneath it. But another and more probable legend calls it\r\nBates's Oak, after Bates, an archer at Agincourt in the retinue of the\r\nEarl of Arundel (and in _Henry V._). Good Queen Bess, however, dined in\r\nthe hall of Parham House in 1592. At Northiam, in East Sussex, we shall\r\ncome (not to be utterly baulked) to a tree under which she truly did sit\r\nand dine too.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JACK PUDDING'S WISDOM]\r\n\r\nBeyond Parham, less than two miles to the east, is Storrington, a quiet\r\nSussex village far from the rail and the noise of the world, with the\r\nDowns within hail, and fine sparsely-inhabited country between them and\r\nit to wander in. The church is largely modern. I find the following\r\nsententious paragraph in the county paper for 1792:--\"This is an age of\r\n_Sights_ and _polite entertainment_ in the country as well as in the\r\ncity.--The little town of _Storrington_ has lately been visited by a\r\n_Company of Comedians_,--_a Mountebank Doctor_,--and a _Puppet Show_.\r\nOne day the Doctor's _Jack Pudding_ finding the shillings come in but\r\nslowly, exclaimed to his Master, 'Gad, Sir, it is not worth _our_ while\r\nto stay here any longer, _players_ have got all the _gold_, _we_ all the\r\n_silver_, and _Punch_ all the _copper_, so, like sagacious locusts, let\r\nus migrate from the place we helped to impoverish.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Amberley Church._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A TRAVELLING CIRCUS]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A TIME-HONOURED JOKE]\r\n\r\nThis reminds me that I saw recently at Petworth, whither we are now\r\nmoving, a travelling circus whose programme included a comic interlude\r\nthat cannot have received the slightest modification since it was first\r\nplanned, perhaps hundreds of years ago. It was sheer essential elemental\r\nhorse-play straight from Bartholomew Fair, and the audience received it\r\nwith rapture that was vouchsafed to nothing else. The story would be too\r\nlong to tell; but briefly, it was a dumb show representation of the\r\nvisit of a guest (the clown) to a wife, unknown to her husband. The\r\nscenery consisted of a table, a large chest, a heap of straw and a huge\r\nbarrel. The fun consisted in the clown, armed with a bladder on a\r\nstring, hiding in the barrel, from which he would spring up and deliver\r\na sounding drub upon the head of whatever other character--husband or\r\npoliceman--might be passing, to their complete perplexity. They were, of\r\ncourse, incapable of learning anything from experience. At other times\r\nhe hid himself or others in the straw, in the chest, or under the table.\r\nWhen, in a country district such as this, one hears the laughter that\r\ngreets so venerable a piece of pantomime, one is surprised that circus\r\nowners think it worth while to secure novelties at all. The primitive\r\ntaste of West Sussex, at any rate, cannot require them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pulborough Church._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPETWORTH\r\n\r\n     Pulborough and its past--Stopham--Fittleworth--The natural\r\n     advantages of the Swan--Petworth's feudal air--An historical\r\n     digression naming many Percies--The third Earl of Egremont--The\r\n     Petworth pictures--Petworth Park--Cobbett's opinion--The\r\n     vicissitudes of the Petworth ravens--Tillington's use to business\r\n     men--A charming epitaph--Noah Mann of the Hambledon Club.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetworth is not on the direct road to Horsham, which is our next centre,\r\nbut it is easily gained from Arundel by rail (changing at Pulborough),\r\nor by road through Bury, Fittleworth, and Egdean.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN ANCIENT FORTRESS]\r\n\r\nPulborough is now nothing: once it was a Gibraltar, guarding Stane\r\nStreet for Rome. The fort was on a mound west of the railway,\r\ncorresponding with the church mound on the east. Here probably was a\r\ncatapulta and certainly a vigilant garrison. Pulborough has no invader\r\nnow but the floods, which every winter transform the green waste at her\r\nfeet into a silver sea, of which Pulborough is the northern shore and\r\nAmberley the southern. The Dutch _polder_ are not flatter or greener\r\nthan are these intervening meadows. The village stands high and dry\r\nabove the water level, extended in long line quite like a seaside town.\r\nExcursionists come too, as to a watering place, but they bring rods and\r\ncreels and return at night with fish for the pan.\r\n\r\nBetween Pulborough and Petworth lie Stopham and Fittleworth, both on the\r\nRother, which joins the Arun a little to the west of Pulborough. Stopham\r\nhas the most beautiful bridge in Sussex, dating from the fourteenth\r\ncentury, and a little church filled with memorials of the Bartelott\r\nfamily. One of Stopham's rectors was Thomas Newcombe, a descendant of\r\nthe author of _The Faerie Queene_, the friend of the author of _Night\r\nThoughts_, and the author himself of a formidable poem in twelve books,\r\nafter Milton, called _The Last Judgment_.\r\n\r\nFittleworth has of late become an artists' Mecca, partly because of its\r\npretty woods and quaint architecture, and partly because of the warm\r\nwelcome that is offered by the \"Swan,\" which is probably the most\r\ningeniously placed inn in the world. Approaching it from the north it\r\nseems to be the end of all things; the miles of road that one has\r\ntravelled apparently have been leading nowhere but to the \"Swan.\"\r\nRunaway horses or unsettled chauffeurs must project their passengers\r\nliterally into the open door. Coming from the south, one finds that the\r\nroad narrows by this inn almost to a lane, and the \"Swan's\" hospitable\r\nsign, barring the way, exerts such a spell that to enter is a far\r\nsimpler matter than to pass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _At Pulborough._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN IRRESISTIBLE INN]\r\n\r\nThe \"Swan\" is a venerable and rambling building, stretching itself\r\nlazily with outspread arms; one of those inns (long may they be\r\npreserved from the rebuilders!) in which one stumbles up or down into\r\nevery room, and where eggs and bacon have an appropriateness that make\r\nthem a more desirable food than ambrosia. The little parlour is\r\nwainscoted with the votive paintings--a village Diploma Gallery--of\r\nartists who have made the \"Swan\" their home.\r\n\r\nFittleworth has a dual existence. In the south it is riparian and low,\r\nmuch given to anglers and visitors. In the north it is high and sandy,\r\nwith clumps of firs, living its own life and spreading gorse-covered\r\ncommons at the feet of the walker. Between its southern border and\r\nBignor Park is a superb common of sand and heather, an inland paradise\r\nfor children.\r\n\r\nPetworth station and Petworth town are far from being the same thing,\r\nand there are few more fatiguing miles than that which separates them. A\r\n'bus, it is true, plies between, but it is one of those long, close\r\nprisons with windows that annihilate thought by their shattering\r\nunfixedness. Petworth's spire is before one all the way, Petworth itself\r\nclustering on the side of the hill, a little town with several streets\r\nrather than a great village all on one artery. I say several streets,\r\nbut this is dead in the face of tradition, which has a joke to the\r\neffect that a long timber waggon once entered Petworth's single,\r\ncircular street, and has never yet succeeded in emerging. I certainly\r\nmet it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SHADOW OF THE PEER]\r\n\r\nThe town seems to be beneath the shadow of its lord even more than\r\nArundel: it is like Pompeii, with Vesuvius emitting glory far above. One\r\nmust, of course, live under the same conditions if one is to feel the\r\nauthentic thrill; the mere sojourner cannot know it. One wonders, in\r\nthese feudal towns, what it would be like to leave democratic London or\r\nthe independence of one's country fastness, and pass for a while beneath\r\nthe spell of a Duke of Norfolk, or a Baron Leconfield--a spell possibly\r\nnot consciously cast by them at all, but existing none the less, largely\r\nthrough the fostering care of the townspeople on the rent-roll, largely\r\nthrough the officers controlling the estates; at any rate unmistakable,\r\nas present in the very air of the streets as is the presage of a\r\nthunderstorm. Surely, to be so dominated, without actual influence,\r\nmust be very restful. Petworth must be the very home of low-pulsed\r\npeace; and yet a little oppressive too, with the great house and its\r\ntraditions at the top of the town--like a weight on the forehead. I\r\nshould not like to make Petworth my home, but as a place of pilgrimage,\r\nand a stronghold of architectural taste, it is almost unique.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Stopham Bridge._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PETWORTH'S HISTORY]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOTSPUR'S DESCENDANTS]\r\n\r\nIn the Domesday Book Petworth is called Peteorde. It was rated at 1,080\r\nacres, and possessed a church, a mill worth a sovereign, a river\r\ncontaining 1,620 eels, and pannage for 80 hogs. In the time of the\r\nConfessor the manor was worth _£_18; a few years later the price went down\r\nto ten shillings. Robert de Montgomerie held Petworth till 1102, when he\r\ndefied the king and lost it. Adeliza, widow of Henry I., having a\r\nbrother Josceline de Louvaine whom she wished to benefit, Petworth was\r\ngiven to him. Josceline married Agnes, daughter of William de Percy, the\r\ndescendant of one of the Conqueror's chief friends, and, doing so, took\r\nhis name. In course of time came Harry Hotspur, whose sword, which he\r\nswung at the Battle of Shrewsbury, is kept at Petworth House. The second\r\nEarl was his son, also Henry, who fought at Chevy Chase; he was not,\r\nhowever, slain there, as the balladmonger says, but at St. Albans.\r\nHenry, the third Earl, fell at Towton; Henry, the fourth Earl, was\r\nassassinated at Cock Lodge, Thirsk; Henry, the fifth Earl, led a\r\nregiment at the Battle of the Spurs; Henry, the sixth Earl, fell in love\r\nwith Anne Boleyn, but had the good sense not to let Henry the Eighth see\r\nit. Thomas, his brother, was beheaded for treason; Thomas, the seventh\r\nEarl, took arms against Queen Elizabeth, and was beheaded in Scotland;\r\nHenry, the eighth Earl, attempted to liberate Mary Queen of Scots, and\r\nwas imprisoned in the Tower, where he slew himself; Henry, the ninth\r\nEarl, was accused of assisting Guy Fawkes and locked up for fifteen\r\nyears. He was set at liberty only after paying _£_30,000, and promising\r\nnever to go more than thirty miles from Petworth House. This kept him\r\nout of London.\r\n\r\nThe last two noble Earls of Northumberland were Algernon, Lord High\r\nAdmiral of England, who married Lady Anna Cecil, and planted an oak in\r\nthe Park (it is still there) to commemorate the union; and Josceline,\r\neleventh Earl, who died in 1670, leaving no son. He left, however, a\r\ndaughter, a little Elizabeth, Baroness Percy, who had countless suitors\r\nand was married three times before she was sixteen. Her third husband\r\nwas Charles Seymour, sixth Duke of Somerset, who became in time the\r\nfather of thirteen children. Of these all died save three girls, and a\r\nboy, Algernon, who became seventh Duke of Somerset. Through one of the\r\ndaughters, Catherine, who married Sir William Wyndham, the estates fell\r\nto the present family. The next important Lord of Petworth was George\r\nO'Brien Wyndham, third Earl of Egremont, the friend of art and\r\nagriculture, who collected most of the pictures. The present owner is\r\nthe third Baron Leconfield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Rother at Fittleworth._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE EARL AND THE HOUSEMAID]\r\n\r\nC. R. Leslie, who painted more than one picture in the Petworth gallery,\r\nhas much to say in his _Autobiographical Recollections_ of its noble\r\nfounder the third Earl, his generosity, courtesy, kindly thoughtfulness,\r\nand extreme modesty of bearing. One story contains half his biography. I\r\ngive it in Leslie's words. After referring to his Lordship's\r\nmen-servants and their importance in the house, the painter continues:\r\n\"His own dress, in the morning, being very plain, he was sometimes by\r\nstrangers mistaken for one of them. This happened with a maid of one of\r\nhis lady guests, who had not been at Petworth before. She met him,\r\ncrossing the hall, as the bell was ringing for the servants' dinner, and\r\nsaid: 'Come, old gentleman, you and I will go to dinner together, for I\r\ncan't find my way in this great house.' He gave her his arm, and led her\r\nto the room where the other maids were assembled at their table, and\r\nsaid: 'You dine here, I don't dine till seven o'clock.'\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PETWORTH PICTURES]\r\n\r\nOn certain days in the week visitors are allowed to walk through the\r\ngalleries of Petworth House. The parties are shown by a venerable\r\nservitor into the audit room, a long bare apartment furnished with a\r\nstatue and the heads of stags; and at the stroke of the hour a\r\ncommissionaire appears at the far door and leads the way to the office,\r\nwhere a visitors' book is signed. Then the real work of the day begins,\r\nand for fifty-five minutes one passes from Dutch painters to Italian,\r\nfrom English to French: amid boors by Teniers, beauties by Lely,\r\nlandscapes by Turner, carvings by Grinling Gibbons. The commissionaire\r\nknows them all. The collection is a fine one, but the lighting is bad,\r\nand the conditions under which it is seen are not favourable to the\r\nintimate appreciation of good art. One finds one's attention wandering\r\ntoo often from the soldier with his little index rattan to the deer on\r\nthe vast lawn that extends from the windows to the lake--the lake that\r\nTurner painted and fished in. Hobbemas, Vandycks, Murillos--what are\r\nthese when the sun shines and the ceaseless mutations of a herd of deer\r\nrender the middle distance fascinating? Among the more famous pictures\r\nis a Peg Woffington by Hogarth, not here \"dallying and dangerous,\" but\r\ndemure as a nun; also the \"Modern Midnight Conversation\" from the same\r\nhand; three or four bewitching Romneys; a room full of beauties of the\r\nCourt of Queen Anne; Henry VIII by Holbein; a wonderful Claude Lorraine;\r\na head of Cervantes attributed to Velasquez; and four views of the\r\nThames by Turner. Hazlitt, in his _Sketches of the Picture Galleries of\r\nEngland_, says of this collection:--\"We wish our readers to go to\r\nPetworth ... where they will find the coolest grottoes and the finest\r\nVandykes in the world.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A PICTORAL PARK]\r\n\r\nLord Leconfield's park has not the remarkable natural formation of the\r\nDuke of Norfolk's, nor the superb situation of the Duke of Richmond and\r\nGordon's, with its Channel prospects, but it is immense and imposing.\r\nAlso it is unreal: it is like a park in a picture. This effect may be\r\nlargely due to the circumstance that _fêtes_ in Petworth Park have been\r\nmore than once painted; but it is due also, I think, to the shape and\r\ncolour of the house, to the lake, to the extent of the lawn, to the\r\ndisposition of the knolls, and to the deer. A scene-painter, bidden to\r\ndepict an English park, would produce (though he had never been out of\r\nthe Strand) something very like Petworth. It is the normal park of the\r\naverage imagination on a large scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Almshouse at Petworth._]\r\n\r\nCobbett wrote thus of Petworth:--\"The park is very fine, and consists of\r\na parcel of those hills and dells which nature formed here when she was\r\nin one of her most sportive moods. I have never seen the earth flung\r\nabout in such a wild way as round about Hindhead and Blackdown, and this\r\npark forms a part of this ground. From an elevated part of it, and,\r\nindeed, from each of many parts of it, you see all around the country to\r\nthe distance of many miles. From the south-east to the north-west the\r\nhills are so lofty and so near that they cut the view rather short; but\r\nfor the rest of the circle you can see to a very great distance. It is,\r\nupon the whole, a most magnificent seat, and the Jews will not be able\r\nto get it from the _present_ owner, though if he live many years they\r\nwill give even him a _twist_.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE YOUNG RAVENS]\r\n\r\nOn an eminence in the west is a tower (near a clump where ravens build),\r\nfrom which the other parks of this wonderful park-district of Sussex may\r\nbe seen: Cowdray to the west, the highest points of Goodwood to the\r\nsouth-west, the highest points of Arundel to the south-east, and\r\nParham's dark forest more easterly still. Mr. Knox's account of the\r\nvicissitudes of the Petworth ravens sixty years ago is as interesting as\r\nany history of equal length on the misfortunes of man. Their sufferings\r\nat the hands of keepers and schoolboys read like a page of Foxe. The\r\nfinal disaster was the spoliation of their nest by a boy, who removed\r\nall four of the children, or \"squabs\" as he called them. Mr. Knox, who\r\nused to come every day to examine them through his glass, was in\r\ndespair, until after much meditation he thought of an expedient. Seeking\r\nout the boy he persuaded him to give up the one \"squab\" whose wings had\r\nnot yet been clipped, and this the ornithologist carried to the clump\r\nand deposited in the ruined nest. The next morning the old birds were to\r\nbe seen, just as of old, and that was their last molestation.\r\n\r\nJust under the park on the road to Midhurst is Tillington, a little\r\nvillage with a rather ornamental church, which dates from 1807. There is\r\nnothing to say of Tillington, but I should like to quote a pretty\r\nsentence from Horsfield's _History of Sussex_ concerning the monuments\r\nin the church, in a kind of writing of which we have little\r\nto-day:--\"And as the volume, for which this has been written, is likely\r\nto fall chiefly into the hands of men who are occupied almost solely\r\nwith the cares and business of this life, this slight reference is made\r\nto the monuments of the dead in order that, should the reader of this\r\nbook find, in the present dearth of honesty, of faithfulness, of\r\ndisinterested valour and of loyalty, an aching want in his spirit for\r\nsuch high qualities, let him hence be taught where to go--let him learn\r\nthat, though they are rarely found in the busy haunts of men, they are\r\nstill preserved and have their home around the sanctuary of the altar of\r\nhis God.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A TREASURY OF ARCHITECTURE]\r\n\r\nPetworth should be visited by all young architects; not for the mansion\r\n(except as an object-lesson, for it is like a London terrace), but for\r\nthe ordinary buildings in the town. It is a paradise of old-fashioned\r\narchitecture. The church is hideous; the new hotel, the \"Swan,\" might be\r\nat Balham; but the old part of the town is perfect. There is an\r\nalmshouse (which Mr. Griggs has drawn), in which in its palmy days a\r\nLady Bountiful might have lived; even the workhouse has charms--it is\r\nthe only pretty workhouse I remember: with the exception, perhaps, of\r\nBattle, but that is, however, self-conscious.\r\n\r\nPetworth has known, at any rate, one poet. In the churchyard was once\r\nthis epitaph, now perhaps obliterated, from a husband's hand:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"She was! She was! She was, what?\r\n     She was all that a woman should be, she was that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NOAH MANN]\r\n\r\nIn a book which takes account of Sussex men and women of the past, it is\r\nhard to keep long from cricket. To the north of Petworth, whither we now\r\nturn, is Northchapel, where was born and died one of the great men of\r\nthe Hambledon Club, Noah Mann, who once made ten runs from one hit, and\r\nwhose son was named Horace, after the cricketing baronet of the same\r\nname, by special permission. \"Sir Horace, by this simple act of\r\ngraceful humanity, hooked for life the heart of poor Noah Mann,\" says\r\nNyren; \"and in this world of hatred and contention, the love even of a\r\ndog is worth living for.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Petworth Churchyard._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GEORGE LEAR'S STRATEGY]\r\n\r\nThis is Nyren's account of Noah Mann:\r\n\r\n\"He was from Sussex, and lived at Northchapel, not far from Petworth. He\r\nkept an inn there, and used to come a distance of at least twenty miles\r\nevery Tuesday to practise. He was a fellow of extraordinary activity,\r\nand could perform clever feats of agility on horseback. For instance,\r\nwhen he has been seen in the distance coming up the ground, one or more\r\nof his companions would throw down handkerchiefs, and these he would\r\ncollect, stooping from his horse while it was going at full speed. He\r\nwas a fine batter, a fine field, and the swiftest runner I ever\r\nremember: indeed, such was his fame for speed, that whenever there was a\r\nmatch going forward, we were sure to hear of one being made for Mann to\r\nrun against some noted competitor; and such would come from the whole\r\ncountry round. Upon these occasions he used to tell his friends, 'If,\r\nwhen we are half-way, you see me alongside of my man, you may always bet\r\nyour money upon me, for I am sure to win.' And I never saw him beaten.\r\nHe was a most valuable fellow in the field; for besides being very sure\r\nof the ball, his activity was so extraordinary that he would dart all\r\nover the ground like lightning. In those days of fast bowling, they\r\nwould put a man behind the long-stop, that he might cover both long-stop\r\nand slip; the man always selected for this post was Noah. Now and then\r\nlittle George Lear (whom I have already described as being so fine a\r\nlong-stop), would give Noah the wink to be on his guard, who would\r\ngather close behind him: then George would make a slip on purpose, and\r\nlet the ball go by, when, in an instant, Noah would have it up, and into\r\nthe wicket-keeper's hands, and the man was put out. This I have seen\r\ndone many times, and this nothing but the most accomplished skill in\r\nfielding could have achieved....\r\n\r\n\"At a match of the Hambledon Club against All England, the club had to\r\ngo in to get the runs, and there was a long number of them. It became\r\nquite apparent that the game would be closely fought. Mann kept on\r\nworrying old Nyren to let him go in, and although he became quite\r\nindignant at his constant refusal, our General knew what he was about in\r\nkeeping him back. At length, when the last but one was out, he sent Mann\r\nin, and there were then ten runs to get. The sensation now all over the\r\nground was greater than anything of the kind I ever witnessed before or\r\nsince. All knew the state of the game, and many thousands were hanging\r\nupon this narrow point. There was Sir Horace Mann, walking about outside\r\nthe ground, cutting down the daisies with his stick--a habit with him\r\nwhen he was agitated; the old farmers leaning forward upon their tall\r\nold staves, and the whole multitude perfectly still. After Noah had had\r\none or two balls, Lumpy tossed one a little too far, when our fellow got\r\nin, and hit it out in his grand style. Six of the ten were gained.\r\nNever shall I forget the roar that followed this hit. Then there was a\r\ndead stand for some time, and no runs were made; ultimately, however, he\r\ngained them all, and won the game. After he was out, he upbraided Nyren\r\nfor not putting him in earlier. 'If you had let me go in an hour ago'\r\n(said he), 'I would have served them in the same way.' But the old\r\ntactician was right, for he knew Noah to be a man of such nerve and\r\nself-possession, that the thought of so much depending upon him would\r\nnot have the paralysing effect that it would upon many others. He was\r\nsure of him, and Noah afterwards felt the compliment. Mann was short in\r\nstature, and, when stripped, as swarthy as a gipsy. He was all muscle,\r\nwith no incumbrance whatever of flesh; remarkably broad in the chest,\r\nwith large hips and spider legs; he had not an ounce of flesh about him,\r\nbut it was where it ought to be. He always played without his hat (the\r\nsun could not affect _his_ complexion), and he took a liking to me as a\r\nboy, because I did the same.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A LURGASHALL SATIRIST]\r\n\r\nLurgashall, on the road to Northchapel, is a pleasant village, with a\r\ngreen, and a church unique among Sussex churches by virtue of a curious\r\nwooden gallery or cloister, said to have been built as a shelter for\r\nparishioners from a distance, who would eat their nuncheon there. The\r\nchurch, which has distinct Saxon remains, once had for rector the\r\nsatirical James Bramston, author of \"The Art of Politics\" and \"The Man\r\nof Taste,\" two admirable poems in the manner of Pope. This is his\r\nunimpeachable advice to public speakers:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Those who would captivate the well-bred throng,\r\n     Should not too often speak, nor speak too long:\r\n     Church, nor Church Matters ever turn to Sport,\r\n     Nor make _St. Stephen's Chappell, Dover-Court_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nBIGNOR\r\n\r\n     Burton and the sparrowhawk--James Broadbridge--The quaintest of\r\n     grocer's shops--A transformation scene--The Roman\r\n     pavement--Charlotte Smith the sonneteer--Parson Dorset's\r\n     advice--Humility at West Burton--Bury's Amazons.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo miles due south from Petworth is Burton Park, a modest sandy\r\npleasaunce, with some beautiful deer, an ugly house, and a church for\r\nthe waistcoat pocket, which some American relic hunter will assuredly\r\ncarry off unless it is properly chained.\r\n\r\nMr. Knox has an interesting anecdote of a sparrowhawk at Burton. \"In\r\nMay, 1844,\" he writes, \"I received from Burton Park an adult male\r\nsparrowhawk in full breeding plumage, which had killed itself, or rather\r\nmet its death, in a singular manner. The gardener was watering plants in\r\nthe greenhouse, the door being open, when a blackbird dashed in\r\nsuddenly, taking refuge between his legs, and at the same moment the\r\nglass roof above his head was broken with a loud crash, and a hawk fell\r\ndead at his feet. The force of the swoop was so great that for a moment\r\nhe imagined a stone hurled from a distance to have been the cause of the\r\nfracture.\"\r\n\r\nAt Duncton, the neighbouring village, under the hill, James Broadbridge\r\nwas born in 1796--James Broadbridge, who was considered the best\r\nall-round cricketer in England in his day. He had a curious hit to\r\nsquare-leg between the wicket and himself, and he was the first of whom\r\nit was said that he could do anything with the ball except make it\r\nspeak. In order to get practice with worthy players he would walk from\r\nDuncton to Brighton, just as Lambert would walk from Reigate to London,\r\nor Noah Mann ride to Hambledon from Petworth. Jim Broadbridge's first\r\ngreat match was in 1815, for Sussex against the Epsom Club, including\r\nLambert and Lord Frederick Beauclerk, for a Thousand Guineas.\r\nBroadbridge, after his wont, walked from Duncton to Brighton in the\r\nmorning, and he looked so much like a farmer and so little like a\r\ncricketer that there was some opposition to his playing. But he bowled\r\nout three and caught one and Sussex won the money.\r\n\r\nAbove Duncton rises Duncton Down, which is eight hundred and\r\nthirty-seven feet high, one of our mountains. But we are not to climb it\r\njust now, having business in the weald some four miles away to the east,\r\npast Barlavington and Sutton, at Bignor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE OLDEST GROCER'S SHOP]\r\n\r\nAdmirers of yew trees should make a point of visiting Bignor churchyard.\r\nThe village has also what is probably the quaintest grocer's shop in\r\nEngland; certainly the completest contrast that imagination could devise\r\nto the modern grocer's shop of the town, plate-glassed, illumined and\r\nstored to repletion. It is close to the yew-shadowed church, and is\r\ngained by a flight of steps. I should not have noticed it as a shop at\r\nall, but rather as a very curious survival of a kindly and attractive\r\nform of architecture, had not a boy, when asked the way to the Roman\r\npavement, which is Bignor's glory, mentioned \"the grocer's\" as one of\r\nthe landmarks. One's connotation of \"grocer\" excluding diamond panes,\r\noak timbers, difficult steps, and reverend antiquity, I was like to lose\r\nthe way in earnest, had not a customer emerged opportunely from the\r\ncrazy doorway with a basket of goods. It was natural for the boy, whose\r\npennies had gone in oranges and sweets, to lay the emphasis on the\r\ngrocery; but the house externally is the only one of its kind within\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A ROMAN VILLA]\r\n\r\nIn some respects there is no more interesting spot in Sussex than the\r\nmangold field on Mr. Tupper's farm that contains the Roman pavements.\r\nApproaching this scene of alien treasure one observes nothing but the\r\nmangolds; here and there a rough shed as if for cattle; and Mr. Tupper,\r\nthe grandson of the discoverer of the mosaics, at work with his hoe.\r\nThis he lays on one side on the arrival of a visitor, taking in his hand\r\ninstead a large key. So far, we are in Sussex pure and simple; mangolds\r\nall around, cattle sheds in front, a Sussex farmer for a companion, the\r\nsky of Sussex over all, and the twentieth century in her nonage. Mr.\r\nTupper turns the key, throws open the creaking door--and nearly two\r\nthousand years roll away. We are no longer in Sussex but in the province\r\nof the Regni; no longer at Bignor but Ad Decimum, or ten miles from\r\nRegnum (or Chichester) on Stane Street, the direct road to Londinum, in\r\nthe residence of a Roman Colonial governor of immense wealth, probably\r\nsupreme in command of the province.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of pavement that have been preserved are mere indications\r\nof the splendour and extent of the building, which must have covered\r\nsome acres--a welcome and imposing sight as one descended Bignor Hill by\r\nStane Street, with its white walls and columns rising from the dark\r\nweald. The pavement in the first shed which Mr. Tupper unlocks has the\r\nfigure of Ganymede in one of its circular compartments; and here the\r\nhot-air pipes, by which the villa was heated, may be seen where the\r\nfloor has given way. A head of Winter in another of the sheds is very\r\nfine; but it is rather for what these relics stand for, than any\r\nintrinsic beauty, that they are interesting. They are perfect symbols of\r\na power that has passed away. Nothing else so brings back the Roman\r\noccupation of Sussex, when on still nights the clanking of armour in the\r\ncamp on the hill-top could be heard by the trembling Briton in the Weald\r\nbeneath; or by day the ordered sounds of marching would smite upon his\r\nears, and, looking fearfully upwards, he would see a steady file of\r\nwarriors descending the slope. I never see a Sussex hill crowned by a\r\ncamp, as at Wolstonbury, without seeing also in imagination a flash of\r\nsteel. Perhaps one never realises the new terror which the Romans must\r\nhave brought into the life of the Sussex peasant--a terror which utterly\r\nchanged the Downs from ramparts of peace into coigns of minatory\r\nadvantage, and transformed the gaze of security, with which their grassy\r\ncontours had once been contemplated, into anxious glances of dismay and\r\ntrepidation--one never so realises this terror as when one descends\r\nDitchling Beacon by the sunken path which the Romans dug to allow a\r\nstring of soldiers to drop unperceived into the Weald below. That\r\nsemi-subterranean passage and the Bignor pavements are to me the most\r\nvivid tokens of the Roman rule that England possesses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PARSON DORSET]\r\n\r\nCharlotte Smith, the sonneteer and novelist, was the daughter of\r\nNicholas Turner, of Bignor Park, which contains, I think, the plainest\r\nhouse I ever saw in the country. Charlotte Smith, who was all her life\r\nvery true to Sussex both in her work and in her homes--she was at school\r\nat Chichester, and lived at Woolbeding and Brighton--was born in 1749. A\r\ncentury ago her name was as well known as that of Mrs. Hemans was later.\r\nTo-day it is unknown, and her poems and novels are unread, nor will\r\nthey, I fear, be re-discovered. Her sister, Catherine Turner, afterwards\r\nMrs. Dorset, was the author of _The Peacock at Home_, a very popular\r\nbook for children at the beginning of the last century, suggested by\r\nRoscoe's _Butterfly's Ball_. Mrs. Dorset, by the way, married a son of\r\nthe vicar of Walberton and Burlington, whose curious head-dress gave to\r\nan odd-looking tree on Bury hill the name of Parson Dorset's wig--for\r\nthe parson was known by his eccentricities far from home. The old story\r\nof advice to a flock: \"Do as I say, not as I do,\" is told also of him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VILLAGE HUMILITY]\r\n\r\nThe little village of West Burton, east of Bignor, is associated in my\r\nmind with an expression of the truest humility. A kindly villager had\r\ngiven me a glass of water, and I unfolded my map and spread it on her\r\ngarden wall to consult while I drank. \"Why,\" she said, \"you don't mean\r\nto say a little place like West Burton is marked on a map.\" This is the\r\nvery antipodes of the ordinary provincial pride, which would have the\r\nworld's axis project from the ground hard by the village pump. But pride\r\nof place is not, I think, a Sussex characteristic.\r\n\r\nBury, the next hamlet in the east, under the hills, has curious cricket\r\ntraditions. In June, 1796, the married women of Bury beat the single\r\nwomen by 80 runs, and thereupon, uniting forces, challenged any team of\r\nwomen in the county. Not only did the women of Bury shine at cricket,\r\nbut in a Sussex paper for 1791 I find an account of two of Bury's\r\ndaughters assuming the names of Big Ben and Mendoza and engaging in a\r\nhardly contested prize fight before a large gathering. Big Ben won.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Causeway, Horsham._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nHORSHAM\r\n\r\n     Horsham stone--Horsham and history--Pressing to death--Juvenile\r\n     hostility to statues--Horsham's love of pleasure--Percy Bysshe\r\n     Shelley's boyhood--a letter of invitation--Sedition in Sussex--a\r\n     Slinfold epitaph--Rudgwick's cricket poet--Warnham pond--Stane\r\n     Street--Cobbett at Billingshurst--The new Christ's Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\nHorsham is the capital of West Sussex: a busy agricultural town with\r\nhorse dealers in its streets, a core of old houses, and too many that\r\nare new. There is in England no more peaceful and prosperous row of\r\nvenerable homes than the Causeway, joining Carfax and the church, with\r\nits pollarded limes and chestnuts in line on the pavement's edge, its\r\ngraceful gables, jutting eaves, and glimpses of green gardens through\r\nthe doors and windows. The sweetest part of Horsham is there. Elsewhere\r\nthe town bustles. (I should, however, mention the very picturesque\r\nhouse--now cottages--on the left of the road as one leaves the station:\r\nas fine a mass of timbers, gables, and oblique lines as one could wish,\r\nmaking an effect such as time alone can give. The days of such relics\r\nare numbered.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HORSHAM STONE]\r\n\r\nHorsham not only has beautiful old houses of its own, but it has been\r\nthe cause of beautiful old houses all over the county; since nothing so\r\nadds to the charm of a building as a roof of Horsham stone, those large\r\ngrey flat slabs on which the weather works like a great artist in\r\nharmonies of moss, lichen, and stain. No roofing so combines dignity and\r\nhomeliness, and no roofing except possibly thatch (which, however, is\r\nshort-lived) so surely passes into the landscape. But Horsham stone is\r\nno longer used. It is to be obtained for a new house only by the\r\ndemolition of an old; and few new houses have rafters sufficiently\r\nstable to bear so great a weight. Our ancestors built for posterity: we\r\nbuild for ourselves. Our ancestors used Sussex oak where we use fir.\r\n\r\nNot only is Horsham stone on the roofs of the neighbourhood: it is also\r\non the paths, so that one may step from flag to flag for miles, dryshod,\r\nor at least without mud.\r\n\r\nHorsham's place in history is unimportant: but indirectly it played its\r\npart in the fourteenth century, by supplying the War Office of that era\r\nwith bolts for cross bows, excellent for slaying Scots and Frenchmen.\r\nThe town was famous also for its horseshoes. In the days of Cromwell we\r\nfind Horsham to have been principally Royalist; one engagement with\r\nParliamentarians is recorded in which it lost three warriors to\r\nCromwell's one. In the reign of William III. a young man claiming to be\r\nthe Duke of Monmouth, and travelling with a little court who addressed\r\nhim as \"Your Grace,\" turned the heads of the women in many an English\r\ntown--his good looks convincing them at once, as the chronicler says,\r\nthat he was the true prince. Justices sitting at Horsham, however,\r\nhaving less susceptibility to the testimony of handsome features, found\r\nhim to be the son of an innkeeper named Savage, and imprisoned him as a\r\nvagrant and swindler.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PRESSING TO DEATH]\r\n\r\nHorsham was the last place in which pressing to death was practised. The\r\nyear was 1735, and the victim a man unknown, who on being charged with\r\nmurder and robbery refused to speak. Witnesses having been called to\r\nprove him no mute, this old and horrible sentence, proper (as the law\r\nconsidered) to his offence and obstinacy, was passed upon him. The\r\nexecutioner, the story goes, while conveying the body in a wheelbarrow\r\nto burial, turned it out in the roadway at the place where the King's\r\nHead now stands, and then putting it in again, passed on. Not long\r\nafterwards he fell dead at this spot.\r\n\r\nThe church of St. Mary, which rises majestically at the end of the\r\nCauseway, has a slender shingled spire that reaches a great height--not\r\naltogether, however, without indecision. There is probably an altitude\r\nbeyond which shingles are a mistake: they are better suited to the more\r\nmodest spire of the small village. The church is remarkable also for\r\nlength of roof (well covered with Horsham stone), and it is altogether a\r\nsingularly commanding structure. Within is an imposing plainness. The\r\nstone effigy of a knight in armour reclines just to the south of the\r\naltar: son of a branch of the Braose family--of Chesworth, hard by, now\r\nin ruins--of whose parent stock we shall hear more when we reach\r\nBramber. The knight, Thomas, Lord Braose, died in 1395. The youth of\r\nHorsham, hostile invincibly, like all boys, to the stone nose, have\r\nreduced that feature to the level of the face; or was it the work of the\r\nPuritans, who are known to have shared in the nasal objection? South of\r\nthe churchyard is the river, from the banks of which the church would\r\nseem to be all Horsham, so effectually is the town behind it blotted out\r\nby its broad back. On the edge of the churchyard is perhaps the smallest\r\nhouse in Sussex: certainly the smallest to combine Gothic windows with\r\nthe sale of ginger-beer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A SCHOOL OF CHAMPIONS]\r\n\r\nHorsham seems always to have been fond of pleasure. Within iron railings\r\nin the Carfax, in a trim little enclosure of turf and geraniums, is the\r\nancient iron ring used in the bull-baiting which the inhabitants\r\nindulged in and loved until as recently as 1814. That the town is still\r\ndisposed to entertainment, although of a quieter kind, its walls\r\ntestify; for the hoardings are covered with the promise of circus or\r\nconjuror, minstrels or athletic sports, drama or lecture. In July, when\r\nI was there last, Horsham was anticipating a _fête_, in which a mock\r\nbull-fight and a battle of confetti were mere details; while it was\r\nactually in the throes of a fair. The booths filled an open space to the\r\nwest of the town known as the Jew's Meadow, and among the attractions\r\nwas Professor Adams with his \"school of undefeated champions.\" The\r\nplural is in the grand manner, giving the lie to Cashel Byron's pathetic\r\nplaint:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     It is a lonely thing to be a champion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAvoiding Professor Adams, and walking due west, one comes after a couple\r\nof miles to Broadbridge Heath, where is Field Place, the birthplace of\r\nthe greatest of Sussex poets, and perhaps the greatest of the county's\r\nsons--Percy Bysshe Shelley. The author of _Adonais_ was born in a little\r\nbedroom with a south aspect on August 4, 1792. His father's mother,\r\n_née_ Michell, was the daughter of a late vicar of Horsham and member of\r\nan old Sussex family; another Horsham cleric, the Rev. Thomas Edwards,\r\ngave the boy his first lessons. Field Place is still very much what it\r\nwas in Shelley's early days--the only days it was a home to him. It\r\nstands low, in a situation darkened by the surrounding trees, a rambling\r\nhouse neither as old as one would wish for æsthetic reasons nor as new\r\nas comfort might dictate. There is no view. In the garden one may in\r\nfancy see again the little boy, like all poetic children, \"deep in his\r\nunknown day's employ.\" Indeed, like all children, might be said, for is\r\nnot every child a poet for a little while? In the _Life of Shelley_ by\r\nhis cousin Thomas Medwin is printed the following letter to a friend at\r\nHorsham, written when he was nine, which I quote not for any particular\r\nintrinsic merit, but because it helps to bring him before us in his\r\nField Place days, of which too little is known:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            \"_Monday, July 18, 1803._\r\n                               \"MISS KATE,\r\n                                     \"HORSHAM,\r\n                                         \"SUSSEX.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR KATE,--We have proposed a day at the pond next Wednesday, and if\r\nyou will come to-morrow morning I would be much obliged to you, and if\r\nyou could any how bring Tom over to stay all the night, I would thank\r\nyou. We are to have a cold dinner over at the pond, and come home to eat\r\na bit of roast chicken and peas at about nine o'clock. Mama depends upon\r\nyour bringing Tom over to-morrow, and if you don't we shall be very much\r\ndisappointed.

SHELLEY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SHELLEY IN SUSSEX]\r\n\r\nWe are proud to call Shelley the Sussex poet, but he wrote no Sussex\r\npoems, and a singularly uncongenial father (for the cursing of whom and\r\nthe King the boy was famous at Eton) made him glad to avoid the county\r\nwhen he was older. It was, however, to a Sussex lady, Miss Hitchener of\r\nHurstpierpoint, that Shelley, when in Ireland in 1812, forwarded the box\r\nof inflammatory matter which the Custom House officers\r\nconfiscated--copies of his pamphlet on Ireland and his \"Declaration of\r\nRights\" broadside, which Miss Hitchener was to distribute among Sussex\r\nfarmers who would display them on their walls. These were the same\r\ndocuments that Shelley used to put in bottles and throw out to sea,\r\ngreatly to the perplexity of the spectators and not a little to the\r\nannoyance of the Government. Miss Hitchener, as well as the\r\nrevolutionary, was kept under surveillance, as we learn from the letter\r\nfrom the Postmaster-General of the day, Lord Chichester:--\"I return the\r\npamphlet declaration. The writer of the first is son of Mr. Shelley,\r\nmember for the Rape of Bramber, and is by all accounts a most\r\nextraordinary man. I hear he has married a servant, or some person of\r\nvery low birth; he has been in Ireland for some time, and I heard of his\r\nspeaking at the Catholic Convention. Miss Hitchener, of Hurstpierpoint,\r\nkeeps a School there, and is well spoken of; her Father keeps a Publick\r\nHouse in the Neighbourhood, he was originally a Smuggler and changed his\r\nname from Yorke to Hitchener before he took the Public House. I shall\r\nhave a watch upon the daughter and discover whether there is any\r\nConnection between her and Shelley.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"THE SUSSEX MUSE\"]\r\n\r\nThere Shelley's connection with Sussex may be said to end. Yet a poet,\r\nwhether he will or no, is shaped by his early surroundings. In some\r\nverses by Mr. C. W. Dalmon called \"The Sussex Muse,\" I find the\r\ninfluence of Shelley's surroundings on his mind happily recorded:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"When Shelley's soul was carried through the air\r\n     Toward the manor house where he was born,\r\n       I danced along the avenue at Denne,\r\n     And praised the grace of Heaven, and the morn\r\n       Which numbered with the sons of Sussex men\r\n                 A genius so rare!\r\n     So high an honour and so dear a birth,\r\n       That, though the Horsham folk may little care\r\n       To laud the favour of his birthplace there,\r\n     My name is bless'd for it throughout the earth.\r\n\r\n     I taught the child to love, and dream, and sing\r\n     Of witch, hobgoblin, folk and flower lore;\r\n       And often led him by the hand away\r\n     Into St. Leonard's Forest, where of yore\r\n       The hermit fought the dragon--to this day,\r\n             The children, ev'ry Spring,\r\n     Find lilies of the valley blowing where\r\n       The fights took place. Alas! they quickly drove\r\n       My darling from my bosom and my love,\r\n     And snatched my crown of laurel from his hair.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cottages at Slinfold._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SLINFOLD]\r\n\r\nTwo miles south-west of Field Place, by a footpath which takes us beside\r\nthe Arun, here a narrow stream, and a deserted water mill, we come to\r\nthe churchyard of Slinfold, a little quiet village with a church of\r\nalmost suburban solidity and complete want of Sussex feeling. James\r\nDallaway, the historian of Western Sussex, was rector here from 1803 to\r\n1834. He lived, however, at Leatherhead, Slinfold being a sinecure. A\r\nSlinfold epitaph on an infant views bereavement with more philosophy\r\nthan is usual: in conclusion calling upon Patience thus to comfort the\r\nparents:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Teach them to praise that God with grateful mind\r\n     For babes that yet may come, for one still left behind.\r\n\r\n\r\nA quarter of a mile west is Stane Street, striking London-wards from\r\nBillingshurst, and we may follow it for a while on our way to Rudgwick,\r\nnear the county's border. We leave the Roman road (which once ran as\r\nstraight as might be as far as Billingsgate, but is now diverted and\r\nlost in many spots) at the drive to Dedisham, on the left, and thus save\r\na considerable corner. Dedisham, in its hollow, is an ancient\r\nagricultural settlement: a farm and feudatory cottages in perfect\r\ncompleteness, an isolated self-sufficing community, lacking nothing--not\r\neven the yellow ferret in the cage. The footpath beyond the homestead\r\ncrosses a field where we find the Arun once again--here a stream winding\r\nbetween steep banks, sure home of kingfisher and water-rats.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RUDGWICK]\r\n\r\nRudgwick, which is three miles farther west along the hard high road, is\r\na small village on a hill, with the most comfortable looking\r\nchurch-tower in Sussex hiding behind the inn and the general shop. In\r\nthe churchyard lies a Frusannah--a name new to me.\r\n\r\nRudgwick was the birthplace, in 1717, of Reynell Cotton, destined to be\r\nthe author of the best song in praise of cricket. He entered Winchester\r\nCollege in 1730, took orders and became master of Hyde Abbey school in\r\nthe same city, and died in 1779. Nyren prints his song in full. This is\r\nthe heart of it:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     The wickets are pitch'd now, and measur'd the ground,\r\n     Then they form a large ring, and stand gazing around,\r\n     Since AJAX fought HECTOR, in sight of all TROY,\r\n     No contest was seen with such fear and such joy.\r\n\r\n     Ye bowlers, take heed, to my precepts attend,\r\n     On you the whole fate of the game must depend;\r\n     Spare your vigour at first, nor exert all your strength,\r\n     But measure each step, and be sure pitch a length.\r\n\r\n     Ye fieldsmen, look sharp, lest your pains ye beguile;\r\n     Move close, like an army, in rank and in file,\r\n     When the ball is return'd, back it sure, for I trow\r\n     Whole states have been ruin'd by one overthrow.\r\n\r\n     Ye strikers, observe when the foe shall draw nigh,\r\n     Mark the bowler advancing with vigilant eye:\r\n     Your skill all depends upon distance and sight,\r\n     Stand firm to your scratch, let your bat be upright.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther west is Loxwood, on the edge of a little-known tract of country,\r\nuntroubled by railways, the most unfamiliar village in which is perhaps\r\nPlaistow. Plaistow is on the road to nowhere and has not its equal for\r\nquietude in England. It is a dependency of Kirdford, whence comes the\r\nPetworth marble which we see in many Sussex churches. Shillinglee Park,\r\nthe seat of the Earl of Winterton, is hard by.\r\n\r\nFrom these remote parts one may return to Horsham by way of Warnham, on\r\nwhose pond Shelley as a boy used to sail his little boat, and where\r\nperhaps he gained that love of navigation which never left him and\r\nbrought about his death. Warnham, always a cricketing village, until\r\nlately supplied the Sussex eleven with dashing Lucases; but it does so\r\nno more.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STANE STREET]\r\n\r\nBefore passing to the east of Horsham, something ought to be said of one\r\nat least of the villages of the south-west, namely, Billingshurst, on\r\nStane Street, once an important station between Regnum and Londinum, or\r\nChichester and London, as we should now say. It has been conjectured\r\nthat Stane Street (which we first saw at Chichester under the name of\r\nEast Street, and again as it descended Bignor hill in the guise of a\r\nbostel) was constructed by Belinus, a Roman engineer, who gave to the\r\nwoods through which he had to cut his way in this part of Sussex the\r\nname, Billingshurst, and to the gate by which London was entered,\r\nBillingsgate.\r\n\r\nBillingshurst's place in literature was made by William Cobbett, for it\r\nwas here that he met the boy in a smock frock who recalled to his mind\r\nso many of his deeds of Quixotry. The incident is described in the\r\n_Rural Rides_:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COBBETT AND THE LITTLE CHAP]\r\n\r\n\"This village is seven miles from Horsham, and I got here to breakfast\r\nabout seven o'clock. A very pretty village, and a very nice breakfast,\r\nin a very neat little parlour of a very decent public-house. The\r\nlandlady sent her son to get me some cream, and he was just such a chap\r\nas I was at his age, and dressed just in the same sort of way, his main\r\ngarment being a blue smock-frock, faded from wear, and mended with\r\npieces of _new_ stuff, and, of course, not faded. The sight of this\r\nsmock-frock brought to my recollection many things very dear to me. This\r\nboy will, I daresay, perform his part at Billingshurst, or at some place\r\nnot far from it. If accident had not taken me from a similar scene, how\r\nmany villains and fools, who have been well teased and tormented, would\r\nhave slept in peace at night, and have fearlessly swaggered about by\r\nday!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Rudgwick._]\r\n\r\n\"When I look at this little chap--at his smock-frock, his nailed shoes,\r\nand his clean, plain, coarse shirt, I ask myself, will anything, I\r\nwonder, ever send this chap across the ocean to tackle the base,\r\ncorrupt, perjured Republican Judges of Pennsylvania? Will this little\r\nlively, but, at the same time, simple boy, ever become the terror of\r\nvillains and hypocrites across the Atlantic? What a chain of strange\r\ncircumstances there must be to lead this boy to thwart a miscreant\r\ntyrant like M'keen, the Chief Justice, and afterwards Governor, of\r\nPennsylvania, and to expose the corruptions of the band of rascals,\r\ncalled a 'Senate and a House of Representatives,' at Harrisburgh, in\r\nthat state!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A VILLAGE DISPUTE]\r\n\r\nBillingshurst church has an interesting ceiling, an early brass (to\r\nThomas and Elizabeth Bartlet), and the record of one of those disputes\r\nover pews which add salt to village life and now and then, as we saw at\r\nLittlehampton, lead to real trouble. The verger (if he be the same) will\r\ntell the story, the best part of which describes the race which was held\r\nevery Sunday for certain seats in the chancel, and the tactical\r\n\"packing\" of the same by the winning party. In the not very remote past\r\na noble carved chair used to be placed in one of the galleries for the\r\nschoolmaster, and there would he sit during service surrounded by his\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nOne returns to Horsham from Billingshurst through Itchingfield, where\r\nthe new Christ's Hospital has been built in the midst of green fields: a\r\nglaring red-brick settlement which the fastidiously urban ghost of\r\nCharles Lamb can now surely never visit. \"Lamb's House,\" however, is the\r\nname of one of the buildings; and Time the Healer, who can do all\r\nthings, may mellow the new school into Elian congeniality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nST. LEONARD'S FOREST\r\n\r\n     Recollections of the Forest--Leonardslee--Michael Drayton and the\r\n     iron country--Thomas Fuller on great guns--The serpent of St.\r\n     Leonard's Forest--The Headless Horseman--Sussex and nightingales.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the east of Horsham spreads St. Leonard's Forest, that vast tract of\r\nmoor and preserve which, merging into Tilgate Forest, Balcombe Forest,\r\nand Worth Forest, extends a large part of the way to East Grinstead.\r\n\r\nOnly on foot can we really explore this territory; and a compass as well\r\nas a good map is needed if one is to walk with any decision, for there\r\nare many conflicting tracks, and many points whence no broad outlook is\r\npossible. Remembering old days in St. Leonard's Forest, I recall, in\r\ngeneral, the odoriferous damp open spaces of long grass, suddenly\r\nlighted upon, over which silver-washed fritillaries flutter; and, in\r\nparticular, a deserted farm, in whose orchard (it must have been late\r\nJune) was a spreading tree of white-heart cherries in full bearing. One\r\nmay easily, even a countryman, I take it, live to a great age and never\r\nhave the chance of climbing into a white-heart cherry tree and eating\r\none's fill. Certainly I have never done it since; but that day gave me\r\nan understanding of blackbirds' temptations that is still stronger than\r\nthe desire to pull a trigger. The reader must not imagine that St.\r\nLeonard's Forest is rich in deserted farms with attractive orchards. I\r\nhave found no other, and indeed it is notably a place in which the\r\nexplorer should be accompanied by provisions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEONARDSLEE]\r\n\r\nTo take train to Faygate and walk from that spot is the simplest way,\r\nalthough more interesting is it perhaps to come to Faygate at the end of\r\nthe day, and, gaining permission to climb the Beacon Tower on the hill,\r\nin the Holmbush estate, retrace one's steps in vision from its summit.\r\nIn this case one would walk from Horsham to Lower Beeding, then strike\r\nnorth over Plummer's Plain. This route leads by Coolhurst and through\r\nManning Heath, just beyond which, by following the south, that runs for\r\na mile, one could see Nuthurst. Lower Beeding is not in itself\r\ninteresting; but close at hand is Leonardslee, the seat of Sir Edmund\r\nLoder, which is one of the most satisfying estates in the county. North\r\nand south runs a deep ravine, on the one side richly wooded, and on the\r\nother, the west, planted with all acclimatisable varieties of Alpine\r\nplants and flowering shrubs. The chain of ponds at the bottom of the\r\nravine forms one of the principal sources of the Adur. In an enclosure\r\namong the woods the kangaroo has been acclimatised; and beavers are\r\ngiven all law.\r\n\r\nNorth of Plummer's Plain, in a hollow, are two immense ponds, Hammer\r\nPond and Hawkin's Pond, our first reminder that we are in the old iron\r\ncountry. St. Leonard's Forest, and all the forests on this the forest\r\nridge of Sussex, were of course maintained to supply wood with which to\r\nfeed the furnaces of the iron masters--just as the overflow of these\r\nponds was trained to move the machinery of the hammers for the breaking\r\nof the iron stone. The enormous consumption of wood in the iron\r\nfoundries was a calamity seriously viewed by many observers, among them\r\nMichael Drayton, of the _Poly Olbion_, who was, however, distressed less\r\nas a political economist than as the friend of the wood nymphs driven by\r\nthe encroaching and devastating foundrymen from their native sanctuaries\r\nto the inhospitable Downs. Thus he writes, illustrating Lamb's criticism\r\nof him that in this work he \"has animated hills and streams with life\r\nand passion above the dreams of old mythology\":--\r\n\r\n\r\n                               The daughters of the Weald\r\n     (That in their heavy breasts had long their griefs concealed),\r\n     Foreseeing their decay each hour so fast come on,\r\n     Under the axe's stroke, fetched many a grievous groan.\r\n     When as the anvil's weight, and hammer's dreadful sound,\r\n     Even rent the hollow woods and shook the queachy ground;\r\n     So that the trembling nymphs, oppressed through ghastly fear,\r\n     Ran madding to the downs, with loose dishevelled hair.\r\n     The Sylvans that about the neighbouring woods did dwell,\r\n     Both in the tufty frith and in the mossy fell,\r\n     Forsook their gloomy bowers, and wandered far abroad,\r\n     Expelled their quiet seats, and place of their abode,\r\n     When labouring carts they saw to hold their daily trade,\r\n     Where they in summer wont to sport them in the shade.\r\n     \"Could we,\" say they, \"suppose that any would us cherish\r\n     Which suffer every day the holiest things to perish?\r\n     Or to our daily want to minister supply?\r\n     These iron times breed none that mind posterity.\r\n     'Tis but in vain to tell what we before have been,\r\n     Or changes of the world that we in time have seen;\r\n     When, now devising how to spend our wealth with waste,\r\n     We to the savage swine let fall our larding mast,\r\n     But now, alas! ourselves we have not to sustain,\r\n     Nor can our tops suffice to shield our roots from rain.\r\n     Jove's oak, the warlike ash, veined elm, the softer beech,\r\n     Short hazel, maple plain, light asp, the bending wych,\r\n     Tough holly, and smooth birch, must altogether burn;\r\n     What should the builder serve, supplies the forger's turn,\r\n     When under public good, base private gain takes hold,\r\n     And we, poor woful woods, to ruin lastly sold.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GREAT GUNS]\r\n\r\nWe shall learn later more of this old Sussex industry, but here, in the\r\nheart of St. Leonard's Forest, I might quote also what another old\r\nauthor, with less invention, says of it. Under the heading of Sussex\r\nmanufactures, Thomas Fuller writes, in the _Worthies_, of great guns:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is almost incredible how many are made of the Iron in this\r\n    County. Count _Gondomer_ well knew their goodness, when of King\r\n    James he so often begg'd the boon to transport them. A Monke of\r\n    Mentz (some three hundred years since) is generally reputed the\r\n    first Founder of them. Surely _ingenuity_ may seem _transpos'd_, and\r\n    to have _cross'd her hands_, when about the same time a Souldier\r\n    found out Printing; and it is questionable which of the two\r\n    Inventions hath done more good, or more harm. As for Guns, it cannot\r\n    be denied, that though most behold them as _Instruments of cruelty_;\r\n    partly, because subjecting _valour_ to _chance_; partly, because\r\n    _Guns give no quarter_ (which the Sword sometimes doth); yet it will\r\n    appear that, since their invention, Victory hath not stood so long a\r\n    Neuter, and hath been determined with the loss of fewer lives. Yet\r\n    do I not believe what Souldiers commonly say, 'that _he was curs'd\r\n    in his Mother's belly, who is kill'd with a Cannon_,' seeing many\r\n    prime persons have been slain thereby.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUSSEX IRON WORKS]\r\n\r\nCannon were not, of course, the only articles which the old Sussex\r\nironmasters contrived. The old railings around St. Paul's were cast in\r\nSussex; and iron fire-backs were turned out in great numbers. These are\r\nstill to be seen in a few of the older Sussex cottages in their original\r\nposition. Most curiosity dealers in the country have a few fire-backs on\r\nsale. Iron tombstones one meets with too in a few of the churches and\r\nchurchyards in the iron district. There are several at Wadhurst, for\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE \"LAND SERPENT\"]\r\n\r\nI have seen grass snakes in plenty in St. Leonard's Forest, and was once\r\nthere with a botanist who, the day being fine, killed a particularly\r\nbeautiful one; but the Forest is no longer famous, as once it was, for\r\nreally alarming reptiles. The year 1614 was the time. A rambler in the\r\nneighbourhood, in August of that year, ran the risk of meeting something\r\nworth running away from; just as John Steel, Christopher Holder, and a\r\nwidow woman did. Their story may be read in the Harleian Miscellany.\r\n_True and Wonderful_ is the title of the narrative, _A Discourse\r\nrelating a strange and monstrous Serpent (or Dragon) lately discovered,\r\nand yet living, to the great Annoyance and divers Slaughters both of Men\r\nand Cattell, by his strong and violent Poyson: In Sussex, two Miles\r\nfrom Horsam, in a Woode called St. Leonard's Forrest, and thirtie Miles\r\nfrom London, this present Month of August, 1614. With the true\r\nGeneration of Serpents._ The discourse runs thus:--\"In Sussex, there is\r\na pretty market-towne, called Horsam, neare unto it a forrest, called\r\nSt. Leonard's Forrest, and there, in a vast and unfrequented place,\r\nheathie, vaultie, full of unwholesome shades, and over-growne hollowes,\r\nwhere this serpent is thought to be bred; but, wheresoever bred,\r\ncertaine and too true it is, that there it yet lives. Within three or\r\nfour miles compasse, are its usual haunts, oftentimes at a place called\r\nFaygate, and it hath been seene within halfe a mile of Horsam; a wonder,\r\nno doubt, most terrible and noisome to the inhabitants thereabouts.\r\nThere is always in his tracke or path left a glutinous and slimie matter\r\n(as by a small similitude we may perceive in a snaile's) which is very\r\ncorrupt and offensive to the scent; insomuch that they perceive the air\r\nto be putrified withall, which must needes be very dangerous. For though\r\nthe corruption of it cannot strike the outward part of a man, unless\r\nheated into his blood; yet by receiving it in at any of our breathing\r\norgans (the mouth or nose) it is by authoritie of all authors, writing\r\nin that kinde, mortall and deadlie, as one thus saith:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_Noxia serpentum est admixto sanguine pestis._--LUCAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This serpent (or dragon, as some call it) is reputed to be nine feete,\r\nor rather more, in length, and shaped almost in the forme of an axeltree\r\nof a cart; a quantitie of thickness in the middest, and somewhat smaller\r\nat both endes. The former part, which he shootes forth as a necke, is\r\nsupposed to be an elle long; with a white ring, as it were, of scales\r\nabout it. The scales along his backe seem to be blackish, and so much as\r\nis discovered under his bellie, appeareth to be red; for I speak of no\r\nnearer description than of a reasonable ocular distance. For coming too\r\nneare it, hath already beene too dearely payd for, as you shall heare\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n\"It is likewise discovered to have large feete, but the eye may be\r\nthere deceived; for some suppose that serpents have no feete, but glide\r\nupon certain ribbes and scales, which both defend them from the upper\r\npart of their throat unto the lower part of their bellie, and also cause\r\nthem to move much the faster. For so this doth, and rids way (as we call\r\nit) as fast as a man can run. He is of countenance very proud, and at\r\nthe sight or hearing of men or cattel, will raise his necke upright, and\r\nseem to listen and looke about, with great arrogancy. There are likewise\r\non either side of him discovered, two great bunches so big as a large\r\nfoote-ball, and (as some thinke) will in time grow to wings; but God, I\r\nhope, will (to defend the poor people in the neighbourhood) that he\r\nshall be destroyed before he grow so fledge.\r\n\r\n\"He will cast his venome about four rodde from him, as by woefull\r\nexperience it was proved on the bodies of a man and a woman comming that\r\nway, who afterwards were found dead, being poysoned and very much\r\nswelled, but not prayed upon. Likewise a man going to chase it, and as\r\nhe imagined, to destroy it with two mastive dogs, as yet not knowing the\r\ngreat danger of it, his dogs were both killed, and he himselfe glad to\r\nreturne with hast to preserve his own life. Yet this is to be noted,\r\nthat the dogs were not prayed upon, but slaine and left whole: for his\r\nfood is thought to be, for the most part, in a conie-warren, which he\r\nmuch frequents; and it is found much scanted and impaired in the\r\nencrease it had woont to afford.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIGNED AND WITNESSED]\r\n\r\n\"These persons, whose names are hereunder printed, have seene this\r\nserpent, beside divers others, as the carrier of Horsam, who lieth at\r\nthe White Horse in Southwarke, and who can certifie the truth of all\r\nthat has been here related.\r\n\r\n                                                   John Steele.\r\n                                                   Christopher Holder.\r\n                                                   And a Widow Woman\r\n                                           dwelling nere Faygate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be very interesting to know what John Steele, Christopher\r\nHolder, and the widow woman really saw. Such a story must have had a\r\nbasis of some kind. A printed narrative such as this would hardly have\r\nproceeded from a clear sky.\r\n\r\nSt. Leonard's Forest has another familiar; for there the headless\r\nhorseman rides, not on his own horse, but on yours, seated on the\r\ncrupper with his ghostly arms encircling your waist. His name is\r\nPowlett, but I know no more, except that his presence is an additional\r\nreason why one should explore the forest on foot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUSSEX NIGHTINGALES]\r\n\r\nSussex, especially near the coast, is naturally a good nightingale\r\ncountry. Many of the birds, pausing there after their long journey at\r\nthe end of April, do not fly farther, but make their home where they\r\nfirst alight. I know of one meadow and copse under the north escarpment\r\nof the Downs where three nightingales singing in rivalry in a triangle\r\n(the perfect condition) can be counted upon in May, by night, and often\r\nby day too, as surely as the rising and setting of the sun. But in St.\r\nLeonard's Forest the nightingale never sings. American visitors who, as\r\nMr. John Burroughs once did, come to England in the spring to hear the\r\nnightingale, must remember this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nWEST GRINSTEAD, COWFOLD AND HENFIELD\r\n\r\n     \"The Rape of the Lock\"--Knepp castle--The Cowfold\r\n     brass--Carthusians in Sussex--The Oakendene cricketers--Fourteen\r\n     Golden Orioles on Henfield common--A Henfield botanist--Dr. Thomas\r\n     Stapleton's merits--A good epitaph--Sussex humour.\r\n\r\n\r\nWest Grinstead is perhaps the most remarkable of the villages on the\r\nline from Horsham to Steyning, by reason of its association with\r\nliterature, _The Rape of the Lock_ having been to a large extent\r\ncomposed beneath a tree in the park. Yet as one walks through this broad\r\nexpanse of brake-fern, among which the deer are grazing, with the line\r\nof the Downs, culminating in Chanctonbury Ring, in view, it requires a\r\nsevere effort to bring the mind to the consideration of Belinda's loss\r\nand all the surrounding drama of the toilet and the card table. If there\r\nis one thing that would not come naturally to the memory in West\r\nGrinstead park, it is the poetry of Pope.\r\n\r\nThe present house, the seat of the Burrells, was built in 1806. It was\r\nin the preceding mansion that John Caryll, Pope's friend, made his home,\r\nmoving hither from West Harting, as we have seen. Caryll suggested to\r\nPope the subject of _The Rape of the Lock_, the hero of which was his\r\ncousin, Lord Petre. The line:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     This verse to Caryll, Muse, is due,\r\n\r\n\r\nis the poet's testimony and thanks. John Gay, who found life a jest, has\r\nalso walked amid the West Grinstead bracken.\r\n\r\nWest Grinstead church is isolated in the fields, a curiously pretty and\r\ncheerful building, with a very charming porch and a modest shingled\r\nspire rising from its midst. Brasses to members of the Halsham family\r\nare within, and a monument to Captain Powlett, whose unquiet ghost,\r\nhunting without a head, we have just met. Hard by the church is one of\r\nthe most attractive and substantial of the smaller manor houses of\r\nSussex, square and venerable and well-roofed with Horsham stone.\r\n\r\nA mile to the west, in a meadow by the Worthing road, stands the forlorn\r\nfragment of the keep which is all that remains of the Norman stronghold\r\nof Knepp. For its other stones you must seek the highways, the\r\nroad-menders having claimed them a hundred years ago. William de Braose,\r\nwhom we shall meet at Bramber, built it; King John more than once was\r\nentertained in it; and now it is a ruin. Yet if Knepp no longer has its\r\ncastle, it has its lake--the largest in the county, a hundred acres in\r\nextent, a beautiful sheet of water the overflow of which feeds the Adur.\r\n\r\nWithin a quarter of a mile of the ruin is the new Knepp Castle, which\r\nwas built by Sir Charles Merrik Burrell, son of Sir William Burrell, the\r\nantiquary, whose materials for a history of Sussex on a grand scale,\r\ncollected by him for many years, are now in the British Museum. But\r\nKnepp Castle, the new, with all its Holbeins, was destroyed by fire this\r\n1904.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE NELOND BRASS]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE COWL IN SUSSEX]\r\n\r\nTo the east of the line lies Cowfold, balancing West Grinstead, a\r\nvillage ranged on either side of a broad road. It is famous chiefly for\r\npossessing, in its very pretty church, the Nelond brass, being the\r\neffigy of Thomas Nelond, Prior of Lewes, who died in 1433. Few brasses\r\nare finer or larger; in length it is nearly ten feet, its state is\r\npractically perfect, and pilgrims come from all quarters to rub it. John\r\nNelond, in the dress of a Cluniac monk, stands with folded hands beneath\r\nan arch, protected by the Virgin and Child, St. Pancras, and St. Thomas\r\nà Becket. This splendid relic would, perhaps, were ours an ideal\r\ncommunity, be handed over to the keeping of the Carthusian monks near\r\nby, in the Monastery of St. Hugh, the commanding building to the south\r\nof Cowfold, whose spire is to the Weald what that of Chichester\r\nCathedral is to the plain between the Downs and the sea, and whose\r\nAngelus may be heard, on favourable evenings, for many miles. The\r\nCarthusian monks of St. Hugh's lend a very foreign air to the village\r\nwhen they walk through it. Visitors are encouraged to call at the\r\nporter's gate and explore this huge settlement--often in the very\r\ncompetent care of an Irish brother; while to suffer an accident anywhere\r\nin the neighbourhood is to be certain of a cordial glass of the\r\nmonastery's own Chartreuse.\r\n\r\nIt was at Brook Hill, just to the north of Cowfold, that William Borrer,\r\nthe ornithologist and the author of _The Birds of Sussex_, lived and\r\nmade many of his interesting observations.\r\n\r\nNear Cowfold is Oakendene, a stronghold of cricket at the beginning of\r\nthe last century. William Wood was the greatest of the Oakendene men. He\r\nwas the best bowler in Sussex, the art having been acquired as he walked\r\nabout his farm with his dog, when he would bowl at whatever he saw and\r\nthe dog would retrieve the ball. Borrer of Ditchling, Marchant of Hurst,\r\nVoice of Hand Cross, and Vallance of Brighton, also belonged to the\r\nOakendene club. Borrer and Vallance played for Brighton against\r\nMarylebone, at Lord's, in 1792, and, when all the betting was against\r\nthem, including gold rings and watches, won the match in the second\r\ninnings by making respectively 60 and 68 not out. Another player in that\r\nmatch was Jutten, the fast bowler, who when things were going against\r\nhim bowled at his man and so won by fear what he could not compass by\r\nskill. There are too many Juttens on village greens.\r\n\r\nFive miles south of Cowfold is Henfield, separated from Steyning, in the\r\nsouth-west, by the low-lying meadows through which the Adur runs and\r\nwhich in winter are too often a sheet of water.\r\n\r\nHenfield consists of the usual street, and a quiet, retired common,\r\nflat and marshy, with a flock of geese, some Scotch firs, and a fine\r\nview of Wolstonbury rising in the east. It was on Henfield common that\r\nMr. Borrer once saw fourteen Golden Orioles on a thorn bush. Adventures\r\nare to the adventurous, birds to the ornithologist; most of us have\r\nnever succeeded in seeing even one Oriole.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STAPLETON'S MERITS]\r\n\r\nWilliam Borrer, the botanist, uncle of the ornithologist, was born in\r\nHenfield and is buried there. In his Henfield garden, in 1860, as many\r\nas 6,600 varieties of plants were growing. Beyond a small memoir on\r\nLichens, written in conjunction with Dawson Turner, he left no book.\r\nAnother illustrious son of Henfield was Dr. Thomas Stapleton, once Canon\r\nof Chichester and one of the founders of the Catholic College of Douay,\r\nof whom it was written, somewhat ambiguously, that he \"was a man of mild\r\ndemeanour and unsuspected integrity.\" Fuller has him characteristically\r\ntouched off in the _Worthies_:--\"He was bred in New Colledge in Oxford,\r\nand then by the Bishop (Christopherson, as I take it) made Cannon of\r\nChichester, which he quickly quitted in the first of Queen _Elizabeth_.\r\nFlying beyond the Seas, he first fixed at _Douay_, and there commendably\r\nperformed the office of _Catechist_, which he discharged to his\r\ncommendation.\r\n\r\n\"Reader, pardon an Excursion caused by just _Grief_ and _Anger_. Many,\r\ncounting themselves Protestants in England, do slight and neglect that\r\n_Ordinance_ of _God_, by which their Religion was _set up_, and _gave\r\nCredit_ to it in the first _Reformation_; I mean, CATECHISING. Did not\r\nour _Saviour_ say even to Saint _Peter_ himself, 'Feed my Lambs, feed my\r\nSheep'? And why _Lambs_ first? 1. Because they were _Lambs_ before they\r\nwere _Sheep_. 2. Because, if they be not fed whilst _Lambs_ they could\r\nnever be _Sheep_. 3. Because _Sheep_ can in some sort feed themselves;\r\nbut _Lambs_ (such their tenderness) must either be _fed_ or _famished_.\r\nOur Stapleton was excellent at this _Lamb-feeding_.\"\r\n\r\nAn epitaph in Henfield Church is worth copying for its quaint mixture\r\nof mythology and theology. It bears upon the death of a lad, Meneleb\r\nRaynsford, aged nine, who died in 1627:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Great Jove hath lost his Gannymede, I know,\r\n     Which made him seek another here below--\r\n     And finding none--not one--like unto this,\r\n     Hath ta'en him hence into eternal bliss.\r\n     Cease, then, for thy dear Meneleb to weep,\r\n     God's darling was too good for thee to keep:\r\n     But rather joy in this great favour given,\r\n     A child on earth is made a saint in heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree miles east of Henfield, and a little to the north, is a farm the\r\npresent tenant of which has made an interesting experiment. He found in\r\nthe house an old map of the county, and identifying his own estate,\r\ndiscovered a large sheet of water marked on it. On examining the site he\r\nsaw distinct traces of this ancient lake, and at once set about building\r\na dam to restore it. Water now, once again, fills the hollow, completely\r\ntransforming this part of the country, and bringing into it wild duck\r\nand herons as of old. The lake is completely hidden from the\r\nneighbouring roads and is accessible only by field paths, but it is well\r\nworth finding.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A WOODCOCK ON AN OAK]\r\n\r\nThere once hung in the parlour of Henfield's chief inn--I wonder if it\r\nis there still--a rude etching of local origin, rather in the manner of\r\nBuss's plates to _Pickwick_, representing an inn kitchen filled with a\r\njolly company listening uproariously to a fat farmer by the fire, who,\r\nwith arm raised, told his tale. Underneath was written, \"Mr. West\r\ndescribing how he saw a woodcock settle on an oak\"--a perfect specimen\r\nof the Sussex joke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Church Street, Steyning._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSTEYNING AND BRAMBER\r\n\r\n     Saint Cuthman and his mother--Steyning's architecture--Steyning's\r\n     wise passiveness--Bramber castle--A corrupt pocket borough--A\r\n     Taxidermist-humorist--Joseph Poorgrass in Sussex--The widow of\r\n     Beeding and the Romney--A digression on curio-hunting.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf great interest and antiquity is Steyning, the little grey and red\r\ntown which huddles under the hill four miles to Henfield's south-west.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ADVENTURES OF CUTHMAN]\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of Steyning are lost in the distance. Its church was\r\nfounded, probably in the eighth century, by St. Cuthman, an early\r\nChristian whose adventures were more than usually quaint. He began by\r\ntending his father's sheep, with which occupation his first miracle was\r\nassociated. Being called one day to dinner, and having no one to take\r\nhis place as shepherd, he drew a circle round the flock with his crook,\r\nand bade the sheep, in the name of the Lord, not to stray beyond it. The\r\nsheep obeyed, and thenceforward on repeating the same manoeuvre he\r\nleft them with an easy mind. In course of time his father died, and\r\nCuthman determined to travel; intense filial piety determined him to\r\ntake his aged mother with him. In order to do this he constructed a\r\nwheelbarrow couch, which he partly supported by a cord over his\r\nshoulders. Thus united, mother and son fared forth into the cold world;\r\nwhich was, however, warmed for them by the watchful interest taken in\r\nCuthman by a vigilant Providence. One day, for example, the cord of the\r\nbarrow broke in a hayfield, where Cuthman, who supplied its place by\r\nelder twigs, was the subject of much ridicule among the haymakers.\r\nImmediately a heavy storm broke over the field, destroying the crop; and\r\nnot only then, but ever afterwards in the same field--possibly to this\r\nday--has haymaking been imperilled by a similar storm. So runs the\r\nlegend.\r\n\r\nThe second occasion on which the cord broke and let down Cuthman's\r\nmother was at Steyning. Cuthman took the incident as a divine intimation\r\nthat the time had come to settle, and he thereupon first built for his\r\nmother and himself a hut and afterwards a church. The present church\r\nstands on its site. Cuthman was buried there. So, also, was Ethelwulf,\r\nfather of Alfred the Great, whose body afterwards was moved to\r\nWinchester. Alfred the Great had estates at Steyning, as elsewhere in\r\nSussex.\r\n\r\nWhile Cuthman was building his church a beam shifted, making a vast\r\namount of new labour necessary. But as the Saint sorrowfully was\r\npreparing to begin again, a stranger appeared, who pointed out how the\r\nmischief could be repaired in a more speedy manner and with less toil.\r\nCuthman and his men followed his instructions, and all was quickly well\r\nagain. Cuthman thereupon fell on his knees and asked the stranger who he\r\nwas. \"I am He in whose name thou buildest this temple,\" he replied, and\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Steyning Church._]\r\n\r\nThe present church, which stands on the site of St. Cuthman's, is only a\r\nreminder of what it must have been in its best days. When one faces the\r\ncuriously chequered square tower, an impression of quiet dignity is\r\nimparted; but a broadside view is disappointing by reason of the high\r\ndeforming roof, giving an impression as of a hunched back. (One sees the\r\nsame effect at Udimore, in the east of Sussex.) Within are two rows of\r\nsuperb circular arches, with zigzag mouldings, on massive columns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STEYNING AND HISTORY]\r\n\r\nSteyning has an importance in English history that is not generally\r\ncredited to it. Edward the Confessor gave a great part of the land to\r\nthe Abbey at Fécamp, whose church is, or was, the counterpart of\r\nSteyning's. These possessions Harold took away, an act that, among\r\nothers, decided William, Duke of Normandy, upon his assailing, and\r\nconquering, course. Steyning should be proud. To have brought the\r\nConqueror over is at least as worthy as to have come over with him, and\r\nfar more uncommon.\r\n\r\nIn Church Street stands Brotherhood Hall, a very charming ancient\r\nbuilding, long used as a Grammar School, flanked by overhanging houses,\r\nwhich, though less imposing, are often more quaint and ingratiating.\r\nMost of Steyning, indeed, is of the past, and the spirit of antiquity is\r\nvisibly present in its streets.\r\n\r\nThe late Louis Jennings, in his _Rambles among the Hills_, was\r\nfascinated by the placid air of this unambitious town--as an American\r\nmight be expected to be in the uncongenial atmosphere of age and\r\nserenity. \"One almost expects,\" he wrote, \"to see a fine green moss all\r\nover an inhabitant of Steyning. One day as I passed through the town I\r\nsaw a man painting a new sign over a shop, a proceeding that so aroused\r\nmy curiosity that I stood for a minute or two to look on. The painter\r\nfilled in one letter, gave a huge yawn, looked up and down two or three\r\ntimes as if he had lost something, and finally descended from his perch\r\nand disappeared. Five weeks later I passed that way again, and it is a\r\nfact that the same man was at work on the same sign. Perhaps when the\r\nreader takes the walk I am about to recommend to his attention--a walk\r\nwhich comprises some of the finest scenery in Sussex--that sign will be\r\nfinished, and the accomplished artist will have begun another; but I\r\ndoubt it. There is plenty of time for everything in Steyning.\" I am told\r\nthat Steyning was incensed when this criticism was printed (there was\r\neven talk of an action for libel); but it seems to me that whatever may\r\nhave been intended, the words contain more of compliment than censure.\r\nIn this hurrying age, it is surely high praise to have one's \"wise\r\npassiveness\" (as Wordsworth called it) so emphasised. The passage calls\r\nto mind Diogenes requesting, as the greatest of possible boons, that\r\nAlexander the Great would stand aside and not interrupt the sunshine;\r\nonly at Steyning would one seek for Diogenes to-day. No commendation of\r\nSteyning in the direction of its enterprise, briskness, smartness, or\r\nany of the other qualities which are now most in fashion, would so\r\nspeedily decide a wise man to pitch his tent there as Mr. Jennings'\r\ncertificate of inertia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STEYNING HARBOUR]\r\n\r\nSteyning, if still disposed to stand on its defence, might plead\r\nexternal influence, beyond the control of man, as an excuse for some of\r\nits interesting placidity. For this curiously inland town was once a\r\nport. In Saxon times (when Steyning was more important than Birmingham),\r\nthe Adur was practically an estuary of the sea, and ships came into\r\nSteyning Harbour, or St. Cuthman's Port, as it was otherwise called.\r\nThere is notoriously no such quiet spot as a dry harbour town. In those\r\ndays, Steyning also had a mint.\r\n\r\nBramber, a little roadside village less than a mile south-east of\r\nSteyning, also a mere relic of its great days, was once practically on\r\nthe coast, for the arm of the sea which narrowed down at Steyning was\r\nhere of great breadth, and washed the sides of the castle mound. The\r\nlast time I came into Steyning was by way of the bostel down Steyning\r\nRound Hill. The old place seems more than ever medieval as one descends\r\nupon it from the height (the best way to approach a town); and sitting\r\namong the wild thyme on the turf I tried to reconstruct in imagination\r\nthe scene a thousand years ago, with the sea flowing over the meadows of\r\nthe Adur valley, and the masts of ships clustered beyond Steyning\r\nchurch. Once one had the old prospect well in the mind's eye, the\r\nlandscape became curiously in need of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bramber._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BRAMBER]\r\n\r\nAfter rain, Bramber is a pleasant village, but when the dust flies it is\r\ngood neither for man nor beast. All that remains of the castle is\r\ncrumbling battlement and a wall of the keep, survivals of the renovation\r\nof the old Saxon stronghold by William de Braose, the friend of the\r\nConqueror and the Sussex founder of the Duke of Norfolk's family. Picnic\r\nparties now frolic among the ruins, and enterprising boys explore the\r\nrank overgrowth in the moat below.\r\n\r\nThe castle played no part in history, its demolition being due probably\r\nto gunpowder pacifically fired with a view to obtaining building\r\nmaterials. But during the Civil War the village was the scene of an\r\nencounter between Royalists and Roundheads. A letter from John Coulton\r\nto Samuel Jeake of Rye, dated January 8, 1643-4, thus describes the\r\nevent:--\"The enemy attempted Bramber bridge, but our brave Carleton and\r\nEvernden with his Dragoons and our Coll.'s horse welcomed them with\r\ndrakes and musketts, sending some 8 or 9 men to hell (I feare) and one\r\ntrooper to Arundel Castle prisoner, and one of Capt. Evernden's Dragoons\r\nto heaven.\" A few years later, as we have seen, Charles II. ran a grave\r\nrisk at Bramber while on his way to Brighton and safety.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A POCKET BOROUGH]\r\n\r\nBramber was, for many years, a pocket borough of the worst type. George\r\nSpencer, writing to Algernon Sidney after the Bramber election in 1679,\r\nsays:--\"You would have laughed to see how pleased I seemed to be in\r\nkissing of old women; and drinking wine with handfuls of sugar, and\r\ngreat glasses of burnt brandy; three things much against the stomach.\"\r\nIn 1768, eighteen votes were polled for one candidate and sixteen for\r\nhis rival. One of the tenants, in a cottage valued at about three\r\nshillings a week, refused _£_1000 for his vote. Bramber remained a pocket\r\nborough until the Reform Bill. William Wilberforce, the abolitionist,\r\nsat for it for some years; there is a story that on passing one day\r\nthrough the village he stopped his carriage to inquire the name.\r\n\"Bramber? Why, that's the place I'm Member for.\"\r\n\r\nBramber possesses a humorist in taxidermy, whose efforts win more\r\nattention than the castle. They are to be seen in a small museum in its\r\nsingle street, the price of admission being for children one penny, for\r\nadults twopence, and for ladies and gentlemen \"what they please\"\r\n(indicating that the naturalist also knows human nature). In one case,\r\nguinea-pigs strive in cricket's manly toil; in another, rats read the\r\npaper and play dominoes; in a third, rabbits learn their lessons in\r\nschool; in a fourth, the last scene in the tragedy of the _Babes of the\r\nWood_ is represented, Bramber Castle in the distance strictly\r\nlocalising the event, although Norfolk usually claims it.\r\n\r\nIsolated in the fields south of Bramber are two of the quaintest\r\nchurches in the county--Coombes and Botolphs. Neither has an attendant\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Coombes Church._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JOSEPH POORGRASS IN FACT]\r\n\r\nThe owl story, which crops up all over the country and is found in\r\nliterature in Mr. Hardy's novel _Far from the Madding Crowd_, the scene\r\nwhereof is a hundred miles west of Sussex, has a home also at Upper\r\nBeeding, the little dusty village beyond Bramber across the river. Mr.\r\nHardy gives the adventure to Joseph Poorgrass; at Beeding, the hero is\r\none Kiddy Wee. His rightful name was Kidd; but being very small the\r\nvillage had invented this double diminutive. Lost in the wood he cried\r\nfor help, just as Poorgrass did. \"Who? who?\" asked the owl. \"Kiddy Wee\r\no' Beedin',\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A DEALER OUTWITTED]\r\n\r\nIt was not long ago that a masterpiece was discovered at Beeding, in one\r\nof those unlikely places in which with ironical humour fine pictures so\r\noften hide themselves. It hung in a little general shop kept by an\r\nelderly widow. After passing unnoticed or undetected for many years, it\r\nwas silently identified by a dealer who happened to be buying some\r\nbiscuits. He made a casual remark about it, learned that any value that\r\nmight be set upon it was sentimental rather than monetary, and returned\r\nhome. He laid the matter before one or two friends, with the result that\r\nthey visited Beeding in a party a day or so later in order to bear away\r\nthe prize. Outside the shop they held a council of war. One was for\r\nbidding at the outset a small but sufficient sum for the picture,\r\nanother for affecting to want something else and leading round to the\r\npicture, and so forth; but in the discussion of tactics they raised\r\ntheir voices too high, so that a visitor of the widow, sitting in the\r\nroom over the shop, heard something of the matter. Suspecting danger,\r\nbut wholly unconscious of its nature, she hurried downstairs and warned\r\nher friend of a predatory gang outside who were not to be supplied on\r\nany account with anything they asked for. The widow obeyed blindly. They\r\nasked for tea--she refused to sell it; they asked for biscuits--she set\r\nher hand firmly on the lid; they mentioned the picture--she was a rock.\r\nBaffled, they withdrew; and the widow, now on the right scent, took the\r\nnext train to Brighton to lay the whole matter before her landlord. He\r\ntook it up, consulted an expert, and the picture was found to be a\r\nportrait of Mrs. Jordan, the work either of Romney or Lawrence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FURNITURE SWINDLE]\r\n\r\nFurniture is the usual prey of the dealer who lounges casually through\r\nold villages in the guise of a tourist, asking for food or water at old\r\ncottages and farmhouses, and using his eyes to some purpose the while.\r\nPictures are rare. The search for chests, turned bed-posts, fire-backs,\r\nChippendale chairs, warming pans, grandfather's clocks, and other\r\nindigenous articles of the old simple homestead which are thought so\r\ndecorative in the sophisticated villa and establish the artistic credit\r\nand taste of their new owner, has been prosecuted in Sussex with as much\r\nenergy as elsewhere--not only by the professional dealer, but by\r\namateurs no less unwilling to give an ignorant peasant fifteen\r\nshillings for an article which they know to be worth as many pounds. But\r\nsuspicion of the plausible furniture collector has, I am glad to say,\r\nbegun to spread, and the palmiest days of the spoliation of the country\r\nare probably over. It must not, however, be thought that the peasant is\r\nalways the under dog, the amateur the upper. A London dealer informs me\r\nthat the planting of spurious antiques in old cottages has become a\r\nrecognised form of fraud among less scrupulous members of the trade. An\r\noak chest bearing every superficial mark of age that a clever workman\r\ncan give it (and the profession of wormholer, is now, I believe,\r\nrecognised) is deposited in a tumble-down, half-timbered home in a\r\ncountry village, whose occupant is willing to take a share in the game;\r\na ticket marked \"Ginger-beer; sold Here\" is placed in the window, and\r\nthe trap is ready. It is almost beyond question that everyone who bids\r\nfor this chest, which has, of course, been in the family for\r\ngenerations, is hoping to get it at a figure much lower than is just; it\r\nis quite certain that whatever is paid for it will be too much. Ugly as\r\nthe situation is, I like to think of this biting of the biter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chanctonbury Ring._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCHANCTONBURY, WASHINGTON, AND WORTHING\r\n\r\n     Chanctonbury Ring--The planter of the beeches--The Gorings--Thomas\r\n     Fuller on the Three Shirleys--Ashington's chief--Warminghurst and\r\n     the phantasm--Washington--An expensive mug of beer--Findon--A\r\n     champion pluralist--Cissbury--John Selden's wit and wisdom--Thomas\r\n     à Becket's figs--Worthing's precious climate--Sompting church.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor nothing within its confines is Steyning so famous as for the hill\r\nwhich rises to the south-west of it--Chanctonbury Ring. Other of the\r\nSouth Downs are higher, other are more commanding: Wolstonbury, for\r\nexample, standing forward from the line, makes a bolder show, and Firle\r\nBeacon daunts the sky with a braver point; but when one thinks of the\r\nSouth Downs as a whole it is Chanctonbury that leaps first to the\r\ninward eye. Chanctonbury, when all is said, is the monarch of the range.\r\n\r\nThe words of the Sussex enthusiast, refusing an invitation to spend a\r\nsummer abroad, express the feeling of many of his countrymen:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     For howsoever fair the land,\r\n       The time would surely be\r\n     That brought our Wealden blackbird's note\r\n       Across the waves to me.\r\n\r\n     And howsoever strong the door,\r\n       'Twould never keep at bay\r\n     The thought of Fulking's violets,\r\n       The scent of Holmbush hay.\r\n\r\n     And ever when the day was done,\r\n       And all the sky was still,\r\n     How I should miss the climbing moon\r\n       O'er Chanctonbury's hill!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHANCTONBURY RING]\r\n\r\nIt is Chanctonbury's crown of beeches that lifts it above the other\r\nhills. Uncrowned it would be no more noticeable than Fulking Beacon or a\r\nscore of others; but its dark grove can be seen for many miles. In\r\nWiston House, under the hill, the seat of the Goring family, to whom\r\nbelong the hill and a large part of the country that it dominates, is an\r\nold painting of Chanctonbury before the woods were made, bare as the\r\nbarest, without either beech or juniper, and the eye does not notice it\r\nuntil all else in the picture has been examined. The planter of\r\nChanctonbury's Ring, in 1760, was Mr. Charles Goring of Wiston, who\r\nwrote in extreme old age in 1828 the following lines:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     How oft around thy Ring, sweet Hill,\r\n       A Boy, I used to play,\r\n     And form my plans to plant thy top\r\n       On some auspicious day.\r\n     How oft among thy broken turf\r\n       With what delight I trod,\r\n     With what delight I placed those twigs\r\n       Beneath thy maiden sod.\r\n     And then an almost hopeless wish\r\n       Would creep within my breast,\r\n     Oh! could I live to see thy top\r\n       In all its beauty dress'd.\r\n     That time's arrived; I've had my wish,\r\n       And lived to eighty-five;\r\n     I'll thank my God who gave such grace\r\n       As long as e'er I live.\r\n     Still when the morning Sun in Spring,\r\n       Whilst I enjoy my sight,\r\n     Shall gild thy new-clothed Beech and sides,\r\n       I'll view thee with delight.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the trees on the side of Chanctonbury and its neighbours were\r\nself-sown, children of the clumps which Mr. Goring planted. I might add\r\nthat Mr. Charles Goring was born in 1743, and his son, the present Rev.\r\nJohn Goring, in 1823, when his father was eighty; so that the two lives\r\ncover a period of one hundred and sixty years--true Sussex longevity.\r\n\r\nWiston House (pronounced Wisson) is a grey Tudor building in the midst\r\nof a wide park, immediately under the hill. The lofty hall, dating from\r\nElizabeth's reign, is as it was; much of the remainder of the house was\r\nrestored in the last century. The park has deer and a lake. The Goring\r\nfamily acquired Wiston by marriage with the Faggs, and a superb portrait\r\nof Sir John Fagg, in the manner of Vandyck with a fine flavour of\r\nVelasquez, is one of the treasures of the house.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIR ANTHONY SHIRLEY]\r\n\r\nBefore the Faggs came the Shirleys, a family chiefly famous for the\r\nthree wonderful brothers, Anthony, Robert, and Thomas.\r\n\r\nFuller, in the _Worthies_, gives them full space indeed considering that\r\nnone was interested in the Church. I cannot do better than quote\r\nhim:--\"SIR ANTHONY SHIRLEY, second Son to Sir _Thomas_, set forth from\r\n_Plimouth_, _May_ the 21st, 1596, in a Ship called the _Bevis of\r\nSouthampton_, attended with six lesser vessels. His design for _Saint\r\nThome_ was violently diverted by the contagion they found on the South\r\nCoast of Africa, where the rain did stink as it fell down from the\r\nheavens, and within six hours did turn into magots. This made him turn\r\nhis course to _America_, where he took and kept the city of _St. Jago_\r\ntwo days and nights, with two hundred and eighty men (whereof eighty\r\nwere wounded in the service), against three thousand _Portugalls_.\r\n\r\n\"Hence he made for the Isle of _Fuego_, in the midst whereof a\r\nMountaine, Ætna-like, always burning; and the wind did drive such a\r\nshower of ashes upon them, that one might have wrote his name with his\r\nfinger on the upper deck. However, in this fiery Island, they furnished\r\nthemselves with good water, which they much wanted.\r\n\r\n\"Hence he sailed to the Island of _Margarita_, which to him did not\r\nanswer its name, not finding here the _Perl Dredgers_ which he expected.\r\nNor was his gaine considerable in taking the Town of _Saint Martha_, the\r\nIsle and chief town of _Jamaica_, whence he sailed more than _thirty_\r\nleagues up the river _Rio-dolci_, where he met with great extremity.\r\n\r\n\"At last, being diseased in person, distressed for victuals, and\r\ndeserted by all his other ships, he made by _New-found-land_ to\r\n_England_, where he arrived June 15, 1597. Now although some behold his\r\nvoyage, begun with more courage then counsel, carried on with more\r\nvalour then advice, and coming off with more honour than profit to\r\nhimself or the nation (the Spaniard being rather frighted then harmed,\r\nrather braved then frighted therewith); yet unpartial judgments, who\r\nmeasure not worth by success, justly allow it a prime place amongst the\r\nprobable (though not prosperous) English Adventures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIR ROBERT SHIRLEY]\r\n\r\n\"SIR ROBERT SHIRLEY, youngest Son to Sir _Thomas_, was, by his Brother\r\n_Anthony_, entred in the _Persian_ Court. Here he performed great\r\nService against the _Turkes_, and shewed the difference betwixt\r\n_Persian_ and _English_ Valour; the latter having therein as much\r\nCourage, and more Mercy, giving Quarter to Captives who craved it, and\r\nperforming Life to those to whom he promised it. These his Actions drew\r\nthe Envie of the _Persian_ Lords, and Love of the Ladies, amongst whom\r\none (reputed a Kins-man to the great _Sophy_) after some Opposition, was\r\nmarried unto him. She had more of _Ebony_ than _Ivory_ in her\r\nComplexion; yet amiable enough, and very valiant, a quality considerable\r\nin that Sex in those Countries. With her he came over to _England_, and\r\nlived many years therein. He much affected to appear in _forreign\r\nVestes_; and, as if his _Clothes_ were his limbs, accounted himself\r\nnever ready till he had something of the Persian Habit about him.\r\n\r\n\"At last a Contest happening betwixt him and the Persian Ambassadour (to\r\nwhom some reported Sir Robert gave a Box on the Ear) the King sent them\r\nboth into _Persia_, there mutually to impeach one another, and joyned\r\nDoctor _Gough_ (a Senior Fellow of _Trinity colledge_ in _Cambridge_) in\r\ncommission with Sir Robert. In this Voyage (as I am informed) both died\r\non the Seas, before the controverted difference was ever heard in the\r\nCourt of _Persia_, about the beginning of the Reign of King _Charles_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIR THOMAS SHIRLEY]\r\n\r\n\"Sir THOMAS SHIRLEY, I name him the last (though the eldest Son of his\r\nFather) because last appearing in the world, men's _Activity_ not always\r\nobserving the method of their _Register_. As the Trophies of _Miltiades_\r\nwould not suffer _Themistocles_ to sleep; so the Atchievements of his\r\ntwo younger brethren gave an Alarum unto his spirit. He was ashamed to\r\nsee them worne like Flowers 'in the _Breasts_ and _Bosomes_ of forreign\r\nPrinces, whilst he himself withered upon the stalk he grew on'. This\r\nmade him leave his aged Father and fair Inheritance in this _County_,\r\nand to undertake _Sea Voyages_ into forreign parts, to the great\r\n_honour_ of his _Nation_, but small _inriching_ of _himself_; so that he\r\nmight say to his Son, as _Æneas_ to _Æscanius_:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     'Disce, puer, Virtutem ex me verumque Laborem,\r\n     Fortunam ex aliis.'\r\n\r\n     'Virtue and Labour learn from me thy Father,\r\n     As for Success, Child, learn from others rather.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As to the generall performance of these _three brethren_, I know the\r\n_Affidavit_ of a Poet carrieth but a small credit in the _court of\r\nHistory_; and the _Comedy_ made of them is but a _friendly foe_ to their\r\nMemory, as suspected more accomodated to please the present spectators,\r\nthen inform posterity. However, as the belief of Mitio (when an\r\n_Inventory_ of his adopted _Sons misdemeanours_ was brought unto him)\r\nembraced a middle and moderate way, _nec omnia credere nec nihil_,\r\nneither to _believe all things nor nothing_ of what was told him: so in\r\nthe _list of their Atchievements_ we may safely pitch on the same\r\nproportion, and, when abatement is made for _poeticall embelishments_,\r\nthe remainder will speak them Worthies in their generations.\"--Such were\r\nthe three Shirleys.\r\n\r\nWiston church, which shelters under the eastern wall of the house,\r\nalmost leaning against it, has some interesting tombs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BIOHCHANDOUNE]\r\n\r\nWalking west from Wiston we come to the tiny hamlet of Buncton, one of\r\nthe oldest settlements in Sussex, a happy hunting ground for excavators\r\nin search of Roman remains, and possessing in Buncton chapel a quaint\r\nlittle Norman edifice. The word Buncton is a sign of modern carelessness\r\nfor beautiful words: the original Saxon form was \"Biohchandoune,\" which\r\nis charming.\r\n\r\nBuncton belongs to Ashington, two miles to the north-west on the\r\nWorthing road, a quiet village with a fifteenth-century church (a mere\r\nchild compared with Buncton Chapel) and a famous loss. The loss is\r\ntragic, being no less than that of the parish register containing a full\r\nand complete account, by Ashington's best scribe, of a visit of Good\r\nQueen Bess to the village in 1591. A destroyed church may be built\r\nagain, but who shall restore the parish register? The book, however, is\r\nperhaps still in existence, for it was deliberately stolen, early in the\r\neighteenth century, by a thief who laid his plans as carefully as did\r\nColonel Blood in his attack on the regalia, abstracting the volume from\r\na cupboard in the rectory, through a hole which he made in the outside\r\nwall. No interest in the progress of Queen Elizabeth prompted him: the\r\nregister was taken during the hearing of a law suit in order that its\r\ndamning evidence might not be forthcoming.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WILLIAM PENN IN SUSSEX]\r\n\r\nWhile at Ashington we ought to see Warminghurst, only a mile distant,\r\nonce the abode of the Shelleys, and later of William Penn, who bought\r\nthe great house in 1676. One of his infant children is buried at\r\nCoolham, close by, where he attended the Quakers' meeting and where\r\nservices are still held. The meeting-house was built of timber from one\r\nof Penn's ships.\r\n\r\nA later owner than Penn, James Butler, rebuilt Warminghurst and\r\nconverted a large portion of the estate into a deer park; but it was\r\nthrown back into farm land by one of the Dukes of Norfolk, while the\r\nhouse was destroyed, the deer exiled, and the lake drained. Perhaps it\r\nwas time that the house came down, for in the interim it had been\r\nhaunted; the ghost being that of the owner of the property, who one day,\r\nalthough far distant, was seen at Warminghurst by two persons and\r\nafterwards was found to have died at the time of his appearance.\r\nWarminghurst in those days of park and deer, lake and timber (it had a\r\nchestnut two hundred and seventy years old), might well be the first\r\nspot to which an enfranchised spirit winged its way.\r\n\r\nFrom Warminghurst is a road due south, over high sandy heaths, to\r\nWashington, which, unassuming as it is, may be called the capital of a\r\nlarge district of West Sussex that is unprovided with a railway.\r\nSteyning, five miles to the east, Amberley, seven miles to the west, and\r\nWest Worthing, eight miles to the south, on the other side of the Downs,\r\nare the nearest stations. In the midst of this thinly populated area\r\nstands Washington, at the foot of the mountain pass that leads to\r\nFindon, Worthing and the sea. It was once a Saxon settlement (Wasa inga\r\ntun, town of the sons of Wasa); it is now derelict, memorable only as a\r\nbaiting place for man and beast. But there are few better spots in the\r\ncountry for a modest contented man to live and keep a horse. Rents are\r\nlow, turfed hills are near, and there is good hunting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A COSTLY QUART]\r\n\r\nThe church, which was restored about fifty years ago, but retains its\r\nTudor tower, stands above the village. In 1866 three thousand pennies of\r\nthe reign of Edward the Confessor and Harold were turned up by a plough\r\nin this parish, and, says Mr. Lower, were held so cheaply by their\r\nfinders that half a pint measure of them was offered at the inn by one\r\nman in exchange for a quart of beer. Possibly Mr. Hilaire Belloc would\r\nnot think the price excessive, for I find him writing, in a \"Sussex\r\nDrinking Song\":\r\n\r\n\r\n     They sell good beer at Haslemere\r\n       And under Guildford Hill;\r\n     At little Cowfold, as I've been told,\r\n       A beggar may drink his fill.\r\n     There is a good brew in Amberley too,\r\n       And by the Bridge also;\r\n     But the swipes they take in at the Washington Inn\r\n       Is the very best beer I know.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe white road to Worthing from Washington first climbs the hills and\r\nthen descends steadily to the sea. The first village is Findon, three\r\nmiles distant, but one passes on the way two large houses, Highden and\r\nMuntham. Muntham, which was originally a shooting box of Viscount\r\nMontagu, lord of Cowdray, was rebuilt in the nineteenth century by an\r\neccentric traveller in the East, named Frankland, a descendant of Oliver\r\nCromwell, who, settling at home again, gave up his time to collecting\r\nmechanical appliances.\r\n\r\nFindon is a pleasant little village at the bottom of the valley, the\r\nhome of the principal Sussex training stable, which has its galloping\r\ncourse under Cissbury. Training stables may be found in many parts of\r\nthe Downs, but the Sussex turf has not played the same part in the\r\nmaking of race horses as that of Hampshire and Berkshire.\r\n\r\nLady Butler painted the background of her picture of Balaclava at\r\nFindon, the neighbourhood of which curiously resembles in configuration\r\nthe Russian battlefield.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A FINISHED PLURALIST]\r\n\r\nThe rector of Findon in 1276, Galfridus de Aspall, seems to have brought\r\nthe art of pluralising to a finer point than most. In addition to being\r\nrector of Findon, he had, Mr. Lower tells us, a benefice in London, two\r\nin the diocese of Lincoln, one in Rochester, one in Hereford, one in\r\nCoventry, one in Salisbury, and seven in Norwich. He was also Canon of\r\nSt. Paul's and Master of St. Leonard's Hospital at York.\r\n\r\nAbove Findon on the south-east rises Cissbury, one of the finest of the\r\nSouth Downs, but, by reason of its inland position, less noticeable than\r\nthe hills on the line. There have been many conjectures as to its\r\nhistory. The Romans may have used it for military purposes, as certainly\r\nthey did for the pacific cultivation of the grape, distinct terraces as\r\nof a vineyard being still visible; traces of a factory of flint arrow\r\nheads have been found (giving it the ugly name of the \"Flint\r\nSheffield\"); while Cissa, lord of Chichester, may have had a bury or\r\nfort there. Mr. Lower's theory is that the earthworks on the summit,\r\nwhatever their later function, were originally religious, and probably\r\ndruidical.\r\n\r\nSalvington (a little village which is gained by leaving the main road\r\ntwo miles beyond Cissbury and bearing to the west) is distinguished as\r\nthe birthplace, in 1584, of one who was considered by Hugo Grotius to be\r\nthe glory of the English nation--John Selden. Nowadays, when we choose\r\nour glories among other classes of men than jurists and wits, it is more\r\nthan possible for even cultured persons who are interested in books to\r\ngo through life very happily without knowledge at all of this great man,\r\nthe friend of great men and the writer best endowed with common sense of\r\nany of his day. From Selden's _Table Talk_ I take a few passages on the\r\nhomelier side, to be read at Salvington:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JOHN SELDEN'S WISDOM]\r\n\r\n\r\n     FRIENDS.\r\n\r\n     Old Friends are best. King James used to call for his old Shoes;\r\n     they were easiest for his Feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n     CONSCIENCE.\r\n\r\n     Some men make it a Case of Conscience, whether a Man may have a\r\n     Pigeon-house, because his Pigeons eat other Folks' Corn. But there\r\n     is no such thing as Conscience in the Business; the Matter is,\r\n     whether he be a Man of such Quality, that the State allows him to\r\n     have a Dove-house; if so, there's an end of the business; his\r\n     Pigeons have a right to eat where they please themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n     CHARITY.\r\n\r\n     Charity to Strangers is enjoin'd in the Text. By Strangers is there\r\n     understood those that are not of our own Kin, Strangers to your\r\n     Blood; not those you cannot tell whence they come; that is, be\r\n     charitable to your Neighbours whom you know to be honest poor\r\n     People.\r\n\r\n\r\n     CEREMONY.\r\n\r\n     Ceremony keeps up all things: 'Tis like a Penny-Glass to a rich\r\n     Spirit, or some excellent Water; without it the Water were spilt,\r\n     the Spirit lost.\r\n\r\n     Of all people Ladies have no reason to cry down Ceremony, for they\r\n     take themselves slighted without it. And were they not used with\r\n     Ceremony, with Compliments and Addresses, with Legs and Kissing of\r\n     Hands, they were the pitifullest Creatures in the World. But yet\r\n     methinks to kiss their Hands after their Lips, as some do, is like\r\n     little Boys, that after they eat the apple, fall to the Paring, out\r\n     of a Love they have to the Apple.\r\n\r\n\r\n     RELIGION.\r\n\r\n     Religion is like the Fashion: one Man wears his Doublet slashed,\r\n     another laced, another plain; but every Man has a Doublet. So every\r\n     man has his Religion. We differ about Trimming.\r\n\r\n     Alteration of Religion is dangerous, because we know not where it\r\n     will stay: 'tis like a _Millstone_ that lies upon the top of a pair\r\n     of Stairs; 'tis hard to remove it, but if once it be thrust off the\r\n     first Stair, it never stays till it comes to the bottom.\r\n\r\n     We look after Religion as the Butcher did after his Knife, when he\r\n     had it in his Mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n     WIT.\r\n\r\n     Nature must be the ground-work of Wit and Art; otherwise whatever\r\n     is done will prove but Jack-pudding's work.\r\n\r\n\r\n     WIFE.\r\n\r\n     You shall see a Monkey sometime, that has been playing up and down\r\n     the Garden, at length leap up to the top of the Wall, but his Clog\r\n     hangs a great way below on this side: the Bishop's Wife is like\r\n     that Monkey's Clog; himself is got up very high, takes place of the\r\n     Temporal Barons, but his Wife comes a great way behind.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelden's father was a small farmer who played the fiddle well. The boy\r\nis said at the age of ten to have carved over the door a Latin distich,\r\nwhich, being translated, runs:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Walk in and welcome, honest friend; repose.\r\n     Thief, get thee gone! to thee I'll not unclose.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SAINT THOMAS'S FIGS]\r\n\r\nBetween Salvington and Worthing lies Tarring, noted for its fig gardens.\r\nIt is a fond belief that Thomas à Becket planted the original trees from\r\nwhich the present Tarring figs are descended; and there is one tree\r\nstill in existence which tradition asserts was set in the earth by his\r\nown hand. Whether this is possible I am not sufficiently an\r\narboriculturist to say; but Becket certainly sojourned often in the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury's palace in the village. The larger part of the\r\npresent fig garden dates from 1745. I have seen it stated that during\r\nthe season a little band of _becca ficos_ fly over from Italy to taste\r\nthe fruit, disappearing when it is gathered; but a Sussex ornithologist\r\ntells me that this is only a pretty story.\r\n\r\nThe fig gardens are perhaps sufficient indication that the climate of\r\nthis part of the country is very gentle. It is indeed unique in\r\nmildness. There is a little strip of land between the sea and the hills\r\nwhose climatic conditions approximate to those of the Riviera: hence, in\r\naddition to the success of the Tarring fig gardens, Worthing's fame for\r\ntomatoes and other fruit. I cannot say when the tomato first came to the\r\nEnglish table, but the first that I ever saw was at Worthing, and\r\nWorthing is now the centre of the tomato-growing industry. Miles of\r\nglass houses stretch on either side of the town.\r\n\r\nWorthing (like Brighton and Bognor) owed its beginning as a health\r\nresort to the house of Guelph, the visit of the Princess Amelia in 1799\r\nhaving added a _cachet_, previously lacking, to its invigorating\r\ncharacter. But, unlike Brighton, neither Worthing nor Bognor has\r\nsucceeded in becoming quite indispensable. Brighton has the advantage\r\nnot only of being nearer London but also nearer the hills. One must walk\r\nfor some distance from Worthing before the lonely highland district\r\nbetween Cissbury and Lancing Clump is gained, whereas Brighton is partly\r\nbuilt upon the Downs and has her little Dyke Railway to boot. But the\r\nvisitor to Worthing who, surfeited of sea and parade, makes for the hill\r\ncountry, knows a solitude as profound as anything that Brighton's\r\nheights can give him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"HAWTHORN AND LAVENDER\"]\r\n\r\nWorthing has at least two literary associations. It was there that that\r\nmost agreeable comedy _The Importance of Being Earnest_ was written: the\r\ntown even gave its name to the principal character--John Worthing; and\r\nit was there that Mr. Henley lived while the lyrics in _Hawthorn and\r\nLavender_ were coming to him. The beautiful dedication to the book is\r\ndated \"Worthing, July 31, 1901.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     Ask me not how they came,\r\n     These songs of love and death,\r\n     These dreams of a futile stage,\r\n     These thumb-nails seen in the street:\r\n     Ask me not how nor why,\r\n     But take them for your own,\r\n     Dear Wife of twenty years,\r\n     Knowing--O, who so well?--\r\n     You it was made the man\r\n     That made these songs of love,\r\n     Death, and the trivial rest:\r\n     So that, your love elsewhere,\r\n     These songs, or bad or good--\r\n     How should they ever have been?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Sompting._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SOMPTING]\r\n\r\nOf the villages to the west we have caught glimpses in an earlier\r\nchapter--Goring, Angmering, Ferring, and so forth; to the north and east\r\nare Broadwater, Sompting and Lancing. Broadwater is perhaps a shade too\r\nnear Worthing to be interesting, but Sompting, lying under the Downs, is\r\nunspoiled, with its fascinating church among the elms and rocks. The\r\nchurch (of which Mr. Griggs has made an exquisite drawing) was built\r\nnearly eight hundred years ago. Within are some curious fragments of\r\nsculpture, and a tomb which Mr. Lower considered to belong to Richard\r\nBury, Bishop of Chichester in the reign of Henry VIII. East of Sompting\r\nlie the two Lancings, North Lancing on the hill, South Lancing on the\r\ncoast. East of North Lancing, the true village, stands Lancing College,\r\nhigh above the river, with its imposing chapel, a landmark in the valley\r\nof the Adur and far out to sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lancing._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nBRIGHTON\r\n\r\n     A decline in interest--The storied past of Brighton--Dr. Russell's\r\n     discovery--The First Gentleman in Europe--The resources of the\r\n     Steyne--Promenade Grove--A loyal journalist--The Brighton\r\n     bathers--Smoaker and Martha Gunn--The Prince and cricket--The\r\n     Nonpareil at work--Byron at Brighton--Hazlitt's observation--Horace\r\n     Smith's verses--Sidney Smith on the M.C.--Captain Tattersall--Pitt\r\n     and the heckler--Dr. Johnson in the sea--Mrs. Pipchin and Dr.\r\n     Blimber--The Brighton fishermen--Richard Jefferies on the town--The\r\n     Cavalier--Mr. Booth's birds--Old Pottery.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrighton is interesting only in its past. To-day it is a suburb, a lung,\r\nof London; the rapid recuperator of Londoners with whom the pace has\r\nbeen too severe; the Mecca of day-excursionists, the steady friend of\r\ninvalids and half-pay officers. It is vast, glittering, gay; but it is\r\nnot interesting.\r\n\r\nTo persons who care little for new towns the value of Brighton lies in\r\nits position as the key to good country. In a few minutes one can travel\r\nby train to the Dyke, and leaving booths and swings behind, be free of\r\nmiles of turfed Down or cultivated Weald; in a few minutes one can reach\r\nHassocks, the station for Wolstonbury and Ditchling Beacon; in a few\r\nminutes one can gain Falmer and plunge into Stanmer Park; or, travelling\r\nto the next station, correct the effect of Brighton's hard brilliance\r\namid the soothing sleepinesses of Lewes; in a few minutes on the western\r\nline one can be at Shoreham, amid ship-builders and sail-makers, or on\r\nthe ramparts of Bramber Castle, or among the distractions of Steyning\r\ncattle market, with Chanctonbury Ring rising solemnly beyond. Brighton,\r\nhowever, knows little of these homes of peace, for she looks only out to\r\nsea or towards London.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BRIGHTON'S STORIED PAST]\r\n\r\nBrighton was, however, interesting a hundred years ago; when the\r\nPavilion was the favourite resort of the First Gentleman in Europe\r\n(whose opulent charms, preserved in the permanency of mosaic, may be\r\nseen in the Museum); when the Steyne was a centre of fashion and folly;\r\ncoaches dashed out of Castle Square every morning and into Castle Square\r\nevery evening; Munden and Mrs. Siddons were to be seen at one or other\r\nof the theatres; Martha Gunn dipped ladies in the sea; Lord Frederick\r\nBeauclerck played long innings on the Level; and Mr. Barrymore took a\r\npair of horses up Mrs. Fitzherbert's staircase and could not get them\r\ndown again without the assistance of a posse of blacksmiths.\r\n\r\nBrighton was interesting then, reposing in the smiles of the Prince of\r\nWales and his friends. But it is interesting no more,--with the Pavilion\r\na show place, the Dome a concert hall, the Steyne an enclosure, Martha\r\nGunn in her grave, the Chain Pier a memory, Mrs. Fitzherbert's house the\r\nheadquarters of the Young Men's Christian Association, and the Brighton\r\nroad a racing track for cyclists, motor cars and walking stockbrokers.\r\nBrighton is entertaining, salubrious, fashionable, what you will. Its\r\ninterest has gone.\r\n\r\nThe town's rise from Brighthelmstone (pronounced Brighton) a fishing\r\nvillage, to Brighton, the marine resort of all that was most dashing in\r\nEnglish society, was brought about by a Lewes doctor in the days when\r\nLewes was to Brighton what Brighton now is to Lewes. This doctor was\r\nRichard Russell, born in 1687, who, having published in 1750 a book on\r\nthe remedial effects of sea water, in 1754 removed to Brighton to be\r\nable to attend to the many patients that were flocking thither. That\r\nbook was the beginning of Brighton's greatness. The seal was set upon it\r\nin 1783, when the Prince of Wales, then a young man just one and twenty,\r\nfirst visited the town.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LE PRINCE S'AMUSE]\r\n\r\nThe Prince's second visit to Brighton was in July 1784. He then stayed\r\nat the house engaged for him by his cook, Louis Weltje, which, when he\r\ndecided to build, became the nucleus of the Pavilion. The Prince at this\r\ntime (he was now twenty-two) was full of spirit and enterprise, and in\r\nthe company of Colonel Hanger, Sir John Lade of Etchingham, and other\r\nbloods, was ready for anything: even hard work, for in July 1784 he rode\r\nfrom Brighton to London and back again, on horse-back, in ten hours. One\r\nof his diversions in 1785 is thus described in the Press: \"On Monday,\r\nJune 27, His Royal Highness amused himself on the Steyne for some time\r\nin attempting to _shoot doves with single balls_; but with what result\r\nwe have not heard, though the Prince is esteemed a most excellent shot,\r\nand seldom presents his piece without doing some execution. The Prince,\r\nin the course of his diversion, either by design or accident, _lowered\r\nthe tops of several of the chimneys of the Hon. Mr. Windham's house_.\"\r\nThe Prince seemed to live for the Steyne. When the first scheme of the\r\nPavilion was completed, in 1787, his bedroom in it was so designed that\r\nhe could recline at his ease and by means of mirrors watch everything\r\nthat was happening on his favourite promenade.\r\n\r\nThe Prince was probably as bad as history states, but he had the quality\r\nof his defects, and Brighton was the livelier for the presence of his\r\nfriends. Lyme Regis, Margate, Worthing, Lymington, Bognor--these had\r\nnothing to offer beyond the sea. Brighton could lay before her guests a\r\nthousand odd diversions, in addition to concerts, balls, masquerades,\r\ntheatres, races. The Steyne, under the ingenious direction of Colonel\r\nHanger, the Earl of Barrymore, and their associates, became an arena for\r\ncurious contests. Officers and gentlemen, ridden by other officers and\r\ngentlemen, competed in races with octogenarians. Strapping young women\r\nwere induced to run against each other for a new smock or hat. Every\r\nkind of race was devised, even to walking backwards; while a tame stag\r\nwas occasionally liberated and hunted to refuge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN EARTHLY PARADISE]\r\n\r\nTo the theatre came in turn all the London players; and once the\r\nmysterious Chevalier D'Eon was exhibited on its stage in a fencing bout\r\nwith a military swordsman. The Promenade Grove, which covered part of\r\nthe ground between New Road, the Pavilion, North Street and Church\r\nStreet, was also an evening resort in fine weather (and to read about\r\nBrighton in its heyday is to receive an impression of continual fine\r\nweather, tempered only by storms of wind, such as never failed to blow\r\nwhen Rowlandson and his pencil were in the town, to supply that robust\r\nhumorist with the contours on which his reputation was based). The Grove\r\nwas a marine Ranelagh. Masquers moved among the trees, orchestras\r\ndiscoursed the latest airs, rockets soared into the sky. In the county\r\npaper for October 1st, 1798, I find the following florid reference to a\r\ncoming event in the Grove:--\"The glittering Azure and the noble Or of\r\nthe peacock's wings, under the meridian sun, cannot afford greater\r\nexultation to that bird, than some of our beautiful belles of fashion\r\npromise themselves, from a display of their captivating charms at the\r\nintended masquerade at Brighton to-morrow se'nnight.\"\r\n\r\nIn another issue of the paper for the same year are some extempore lines\r\non Brighton, dated from East Street, which end thus ecstatically:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Nature's ever bounteous hand\r\n     Sure has bless'd this happy land.\r\n     'Tis here no brow appears with care,\r\n     What would we be, but what we are?\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this genial county organ I must quote from a paragraph in\r\n1796 on the Prince himself:--\"The following couplet of Pope may be fitly\r\napplied to his Royal Highness:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     If to his share some manly errors fall,\r\n     Look on his face and you'll forget them all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat could be kinder? A little earlier, in a description of these\r\nanodyne features, the journalist had said of his Royal Highness's \"arch\r\neyes,\" that they \"seem to look more ways than one at a time, and\r\nespecially when they are directed towards the fair sex.\"\r\n\r\nQuieter and more normal pastimes were gossip at the libraries, riding\r\nand driving, and bathing in the sea. Bathing seems to have been taken\r\nvery seriously, with none of the present matter-of-course haphazardness.\r\nIn an old Guide to Brighton, dated 1794, I find the following\r\ndescription of the intrepid dippers of that day:--\"It may not be\r\nimproper here to introduce a short account of the manner of bathing in\r\nthe sea at Brighthelmston. By means of a hook-ladder the bather ascends\r\nthe machine, which is formed of wood, and raised on high wheels; he is\r\ndrawn to a proper distance from the shore, and then plunges into the\r\nsea, the guides attending on each side to assist him in recovering the\r\nmachine, which being accomplished, he is drawn back to shore. The guides\r\nare strong, active, and careful; and, in every respect, adapted to their\r\nemployments.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"SMOAKER\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARTHA GUNN]\r\n\r\nChief of the bathing women for many years was Martha Gunn, whose\r\ndescendants still sell fish in the town; chief among the men was the\r\nfamous Smoaker (his real name, John Miles) the Prince of Wales's\r\nswimming tutor. There is a story of his pulling the Prince back by the\r\near, when he had swum out too far against the old man's instructions;\r\nwhile on another occasion, when the sea was too rough for safety, he\r\nplaced himself in front of his obstinate pupil in a fighting attitude,\r\nwith the words, \"What do you think your father would say to me if you\r\nwere drowned? He would say, 'This is all owing to you, Smoaker. If you'd\r\ntaken proper care of him, Smoaker, poor George would still be alive.'\"\r\nAnother of the pleasant stories of the Prince refers to Smoaker's\r\nfeminine correlative--Martha Gunn. One day, being in the act of\r\nreceiving an illicit gift of butter in the pavilion kitchen just as the\r\nPrince entered the room, she slipped the pat into her pocket. But not\r\nquite in time. Talking with the utmost affability, the Prince proceeded\r\nto edge her closer and closer to the great fire, pocket side nearest,\r\nand there he kept her until her sin had found her out and dress and\r\nbutter were both ruined. Doubtless his Royal Highness made both good,\r\nfor he had all the minor generosities.\r\n\r\nAn old book, quoted in Mr. Bishop's interesting volume _A Peep into the\r\nPast_, gives the following scrap of typical conversation between Martha\r\nand a visitor:--\"'What, my old friend, Martha,' said I, 'still queen of\r\nthe ocean, still industrious, and busy as ever; and how do you find\r\nyourself'? 'Well and hearty, thank God, sir,' replied she, 'but rather\r\nhobbling. I don't bathe, because I a'nt so strong as I used to be, so I\r\nsuperintend on the beach, for I'm up before any of 'em; you may always\r\nfind me and my pitcher at one exact spot, every morning by six o'clock.'\r\n'You wear vastly well, my old friend, pray what age may you be'? 'Only\r\neighty-eight, sir; in fact, eighty-nine come next Christmas pudding;\r\naye, and though I've lost my teeth I can mumble it with as good relish\r\nand hearty appetite as anybody.' 'I'm glad to hear it; Brighton would\r\nnot look like itself without you, Martha,' said I. 'Oh, I don't know,\r\nit's like to do without me, some day,' answered she, 'but while I've\r\nhealth and life, I must be bustling amongst my old friends and\r\nbenefactors; I think I ought to be proud, for I've as many bows from\r\nman, woman, and child, as the Prince hisself; aye, I do believe, the\r\nvery dogs in the town know me.' 'And your son, how is he'? said I.\r\n'Brave and charming; he lives in East Street; if your honour wants any\r\nprime pickled salmon, or oysters, there you have 'em.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the Prince's birthday, and on the birthday of his royal brothers,\r\nBrighton went mad with excitement. Oxen were roasted whole, strong beer\r\nran like water, and among the amusements single-wicket matches were\r\nplayed. One of the good deeds of the Prince was the making of a cricket\r\nground. Before 1791, when the Prince's ground was laid out, matches had\r\nbeen played on the neighbouring hills, or on the Level. The Prince's\r\nground stood partly on the Level as it now is, and partly on Park\r\nCrescent. In 1823, it became Ireland's Gardens, upon whose turf the most\r\nfamous cricketers of England played until 1847. In 1848 the Brunswick\r\nground at Hove was opened, close to the sea, into which the ball was\r\noccasionally hit by Mr. C. I. Thornton. The present Hove ground dates\r\nfrom 1871. I like to think that George IV., though no great cricketer\r\nhimself (he played now and then when young \"with great condescension and\r\naffability\"), is the true father of Sussex cricket. He may deserve all\r\nthat Lamb, Leigh Hunt, and Thackeray said of him, but without his\r\ninfluence and patronage the history of cricket would be the poorer by\r\nmany bright pages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE NONPAREIL]\r\n\r\nWhere Montpellier Crescent now stands, was, eighty years ago, the ground\r\non which Frederick William Lillywhite, the Nonpareil, used to bowl to\r\ngentlemen young or old who were prepared to put down five shillings for\r\nthe privilege. Little Wisden acted as a long stop. Lillywhite was the\r\nreal creator of round-arm bowling, although Tom Walker of the Hambledon\r\nClub was the pioneer and James Broadbridge an earlier exponent. It was\r\nnot until 1828 that round-arm was legalised. \"Me bowling, Pilch batting,\r\nand Box keeping wicket--that's cricket,\" was the old man's dictum; or\r\n\"When I bowls and Fuller bats,\" a variant has it, bowl being pronounced\r\nto rhyme with owl, \"then you'll see cricket.\" He was thirty-five before\r\nhe began his first-class career, he bowled fewer than a dozen wides in\r\ntwenty-seven years, and his myriad wickets cost only seven runs a-piece.\r\n\r\nBrighton in its palmiest days was practically contained within the\r\nstreets that bear boundary names, North Street, East Street, West\r\nStreet, and the sea, with the parish church high on the hill. On the\r\nother side of the Steyne were the naked Downs, while the Lewes road and\r\nthe London Road were mere thoroughfares between equally bare hills, with\r\na few houses here and there.\r\n\r\nDuring the town's most fashionable period, which continued for nearly\r\nfifty years--say from 1785 to 1835--everyone journeyed thither; and\r\nindeed everyone goes to Brighton to-day, although its visitors are now\r\nanonymous where of old they were notorious. I believe that Robert\r\nBrowning is the only eminent Englishman that never visited the town.\r\nPerhaps it does little for poets; yet Byron was there as a young man,\r\nmuch in the company of a charming youth with whom he often sailed in the\r\nChannel, and who afterwards was discovered to be a girl.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HORACE SMITH]\r\n\r\nA minor poet, Horace Smith, gives us, in _Horace in London_, a sprightly\r\npicture of the town in 1813, from which we see that the changes between\r\nnow and then are only in externals:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BRIGHTON.\r\n\r\n         _Solvitur acris hyems gratâ vice veris._\r\n\r\n     Now fruitful autumn lifts his sunburnt head,\r\n       The slighted Park few cambric muslins whiten,\r\n     The dry machines revisit Ocean's bed,\r\n       And Horace quits awhile the town for _Brighton_.\r\n\r\n     The cit foregoes his box at Turnham Green,\r\n       To pick up health and shells with Amphitrite,\r\n     Pleasure's frail daughters trip along the Steyne,\r\n       Led by the dame the Greeks call Aphrodite.\r\n\r\n     Phoebus, the tanner, plies his fiery trade,\r\n       The graceful nymphs ascend Judea's ponies,\r\n     Scale the west cliff, or visit the parade,\r\n       While poor papa in town a patient drone is.\r\n\r\n     Loose trowsers snatch the wreath from pantaloons;\r\n       Nankeen of late were worn the sultry weather in;\r\n     But now, (so will the Prince's light dragoons,)\r\n       White jean have triumph'd o'er their Indian brethren.\r\n\r\n     Here with choice food earth smiles and ocean yawns,\r\n       Intent alike to please the London glutton;\r\n     This, for our breakfast proffers shrimps and prawns,\r\n       That, for our dinner, South-down lamb and mutton.\r\n\r\n     Yet here, as elsewhere, death impartial reigns,\r\n       Visits alike the cot and the _Pavilion_,\r\n     And for a bribe with equal scorn disdains\r\n       My half a crown, and _Baring's_ half a million.\r\n\r\n     Alas! how short the span of human pride!\r\n       Time flies, and hope's romantic schemes, are undone;\r\n     Cosweller's coach, that carries four inside,\r\n       Waits to take back the unwilling bard to London.\r\n\r\n     Ye circulating novelists, adieu!\r\n       Long envious cords my black portmanteau tighten;\r\n     Billiards, begone! avaunt, illegal loo!\r\n       Farewell old Ocean's bauble, glittering Brighton.\r\n\r\n     Long shalt thou laugh thine enemies to scorn,\r\n       Proud as Phoenicia, queen of watering places!\r\n     Boys yet unbreech'd, and virgins yet unborn,\r\n       On thy bleak downs shall tan their blooming faces.\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe that the phrase \"Queen of Watering Places\" was first used in\r\nthis poem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXTINCT COURTESY]\r\n\r\nAn odd glimpse of a kind of manners (now extinct) in Brighton visitors\r\nin its palmy days is given in Hazlitt's _Notes of a Journey through\r\nFrance and Italy_. Hazlitt, like his friends the Lambs, when they\r\nvisited Versailles in 1822, embarked at Brighton. That was in 1824. He\r\nreached the town by coach in the evening, in the height of the season,\r\nand it was then that the incident occurred to which I have referred. In\r\nHazlitt's words:--\"A lad offered to conduct us to an inn. 'Did he think\r\nthere was room?' He was sure of it. 'Did he belong to the inn?' 'No,' he\r\nwas from London. In fact, he was a young gentleman from town, who had\r\nbeen stopping some time at the White-horse Hotel, and who wished to\r\nemploy his spare time (when he was not riding out on a blood-horse) in\r\nserving the house, and relieving the perplexities of his\r\nfellow-travellers. No one but a Londoner would volunteer his assistance\r\nin this way. Amiable land of _Cockayne_, happy in itself, and in making\r\nothers happy! Blest exuberance of self-satisfaction, that overflows\r\nupon others! Delightful impertinence, that is forward to oblige them!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LORD OF THE TIDES]\r\n\r\nBrighton's decline as a fashionable resort came with the railway.\r\nCoaches were expensive and few, and the number of visitors which they\r\nbrought to the town was negotiable; but when trains began to pour crowds\r\nupon the platforms the distinction of Brighton was lost. Society\r\nretreated, and the last Master of Ceremonies, Lieut. Col. Eld, died. It\r\nwas of this admirable aristocrat that Sydney Smith wrote so happily in\r\none of his letters from Brighton: \"A gentleman attired _point device_,\r\nwalking down the Parade, like Agag, 'delicately.' He pointed out his\r\ntoes like a dancing-master; but carried his head like a potentate. As he\r\npassed the stand of flys, he nodded approval, as if he owned them all.\r\nAs he approached the little goat carriages, he looked askance over the\r\nedge of his starched neckcloth and blandly smiled encouragement. Sure\r\nthat in following him, I was treading in the steps of greatness, I went\r\non to the Pier, and there I was confirmed in my conviction of his\r\neminence; for I observed him look first over the right side and then\r\nover the left, with an expression of serene satisfaction spreading over\r\nhis countenance, which said, as plainly as if he had spoken to the sea\r\naloud, 'That is right. You are low-tide at present; but never mind, in a\r\ncouple of hours I shall make you high-tide again.'\"\r\n\r\nBeyond its connection with George IV. Brighton has played but a small\r\npart in history, her only other monarch being Charles II., who merely\r\ntarried in the town for awhile on his way to France, in 1651, as we have\r\nseen. The King's Head, in West Street, claims to be the scene of the\r\nmerry monarch's bargain with Captain Nicholas Tattersall, who conveyed\r\nhim across the Channel; but there is good reason to believe that the inn\r\nwas the George in Middle Street, now demolished, but situated on the\r\nsite of No. 44. The epitaph on Tattersall in Brighton old parish church\r\ncontains the following lines:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     When Charles ye great was nothing but a breath\r\n     This valiant soul stept betweene him and death....\r\n\r\n     Which glorious act of his for church and state\r\n     Eight princes in one day did gratulate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe episode of the captain's cautious bargaining with the King, of which\r\nColonel Gunter tells in the narrative from which I have quoted in an\r\nearlier chapter, is carefully suppressed on the memorial tablet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHEBE HESSEL]\r\n\r\nAnother famous Brighton character and friend of George IV. was Phebe\r\nHessel, who died at the age of 106, and whose tombstone may be seen in\r\nthe old churchyard. Phebe had a varied career, for having fallen in love\r\nwhen only fifteen with Samuel Golding, a private in Kirk's Lambs, she\r\ndressed herself as a man, enlisted in the 5th Regiment of Foot, and\r\nfollowed him to the West Indies. She served there for five years, and\r\nafterwards at Gibraltar, never disclosing her sex until her lover was\r\nwounded and sent to Plymouth, when she told the General's wife, and was\r\nallowed to follow and nurse him. On leaving hospital Golding married\r\nher, and they lived, I hope happily, together for twenty years. When\r\nGolding died Phebe married Hessel.\r\n\r\nIn her old age she became an important Brighton character, and\r\nattracting the notice of the Prince was provided by him with a pension\r\nof eighteen pounds a year, and the epithet \"a jolly good fellow.\" It was\r\nalso the Prince's money which paid the stone cutter. When visited by a\r\ncurious student of human nature as she lay on her death-bed, Phebe\r\ntalked much of the past, he records, and seemed proud of having kept her\r\nsecret when in the army. \"But I told it to the ground,\" she added; \"I\r\ndug a hole that would hold a gallon and whispered it there.\" Phebe kept\r\nher faculties to the last, and to the last sold her apples to the\r\nQuality by the sea, returned repartees with extraordinary verve and\r\ncontempt for false delicacy, and knew as much of the quality of Brighton\r\nliquor as if she were a soldier in earnest.\r\n\r\nOne ought to mention Pitt's visit to Brighton, in 1785, as an historical\r\nevent, if only for the proof which it offers that Sussex folk have an\r\neffective if not nimble wit. I use Mr. Bishop's words: \"Pitt during his\r\njourney to Brighton, in the previous week, had some experience of\r\npopular feeling in respect of the obnoxious Window Tax. Whilst horses\r\nwere being changed at Horsham, he ordered _lights_ for his carriage; and\r\nthe persons assembled, learning who was within, indulged pretty freely\r\nin ironical remarks on _light_ and _darkness_. The only effect upon the\r\nMinister was, that he often laughed heartily. Whilst in Brighton, a\r\ncountry glove-maker hung about the door of his house on the Steyne; and\r\nwhen the Minister came out, showed him a _hedger's cuff_, which he held\r\nin one hand, and a _bush_ in the other, to explain the use of it, and\r\nasked him if the former, being an article he made and sold, was subject\r\nto a _Stamp Duty_? Mr. Pitt appeared rather struck with the oddity and\r\nbluntness of the man's question, and, mounting his horse, waived a\r\nsatisfactory answer by referring him to the _Stamp Office_ for\r\ninformation.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DR. JOHNSON IN THE SEA]\r\n\r\nBrighton's place in literature makes up for her historical poverty. Dr.\r\nJohnson was the first great man of letters to visit the town. He stayed\r\nin West Street with the Thrales, rode on the Downs and, after his wont,\r\nabused their bareness, making a joke about our dearth of trees similar\r\nto one on the same topic in Scotland. The Doctor also bathed. Mrs.\r\nPiozzi relates that one of the bathing men, seeing him swim, remarked,\r\n\"Why, sir, you must have been a stout-hearted gentleman forty years\r\nago!\"--much to the Doctor's satisfaction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MRS. PIPCHIN'S CASTLE]\r\n\r\nIt was, I always think, in Hampton Place that Mrs. Pipchin, whose\r\nhusband broke his heart in the Peruvian mines, kept her establishment\r\nfor children and did her best to discourage Paul Dombey. How does the\r\ndescription run?\r\n\r\n\r\n     This celebrated Mrs. Pipchin was a marvellous ill-favoured,\r\n     ill-conditioned old lady, of a stooping figure, with a mottled\r\n     face, like bad marble, a hook nose, and a hard grey eye, that\r\n     looked as if it might have been hammered at on an anvil without\r\n     sustaining any injury. Forty years at least had elapsed since the\r\n     Peruvian mines had been the death of Mr. Pipchin; but his relict\r\n     still wore black bombazeen, of such a lustreless, deep, dead,\r\n     sombre shade, that gas itself couldn't light her up after dark, and\r\n     her presence was a quencher to any number of candles. She was\r\n     generally spoken of as \"a great manager\" of children; and the\r\n     secret of her management was, to give them everything that they\r\n     didn't like, and nothing that they did--which was found to sweeten\r\n     their dispositions very much. She was such a bitter old lady, that\r\n     one was tempted to believe there had been some mistake in the\r\n     application of the Peruvian machinery, and that all her waters of\r\n     gladness and milk of human kindness had been pumped out dry,\r\n     instead of the mines.\r\n\r\n     The Castle of this ogress and child-queller was in a steep\r\n     bye-street at Brighton; where the soil was more than unusually\r\n     chalky, flinty, and sterile, and the houses were more than usually\r\n     brittle and thin; where the small front-gardens had the\r\n     unaccountable property of producing nothing but marigolds, whatever\r\n     was sown in them; and where snails were constantly discovered\r\n     holding on to the street doors, and other public places they were\r\n     not expected to ornament, with the tenacity of cupping-glasses. In\r\n     the winter-time the air couldn't be got out of the Castle, and in\r\n     the summer-time it couldn't be got in. There was such a continual\r\n     reverberation of wind in it, that it sounded like a great shell,\r\n     which the inhabitants were obliged to hold to their ears night and\r\n     day, whether they liked it or no. It was not, naturally, a\r\n     fresh-smelling house; and in the window of the front parlour, which\r\n     was never opened, Mrs. Pipchin kept a collection of plants in pots,\r\n     which imparted an earthy flavour of their own to the establishment.\r\n     However choice examples of their kind, too, these plants were of a\r\n     kind peculiarly adapted to the embowerment of Mrs. Pipchin. There\r\n     were half-a-dozen specimens of the cactus, writhing round bits of a\r\n     lath, like hairy serpents; another specimen shooting out broad\r\n     claws, like a green lobster; several creeping vegetables, possessed\r\n     of sticky and adhesive leaves; and one uncomfortable flower-pot\r\n     hanging to the ceiling, which appeared to have boiled over, and\r\n     tickling people underneath with its long green ends, reminded them\r\n     of spiders--in which Mrs. Pipchin's dwelling was uncommonly\r\n     prolific, though perhaps it challenged competition still more\r\n     proudly, in the season, in point of earwigs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Mrs. Pipchin's Paul Dombey passed to the forcing-house of Dr.\r\nBlimber, Mrs. Blimber, Miss Blimber and Mr. Feeder, B.A., also at\r\nBrighton, where he met Mr. Toots. \"The Doctor's,\" says Dickens, \"was a\r\nmighty fine house, fronting the sea. Not a joyful style of house\r\nwithin, but quite the contrary. Sad-coloured curtains, whose proportions\r\nwere spare and lean, hid themselves despondently behind the windows. The\r\ntables and chairs were put away in rows, like figures in a sum; fires\r\nwere so rarely lighted in the rooms of ceremony, that they felt like\r\nwells, and a visitor represented the bucket; the dining-room seemed the\r\nlast place in the world where any eating or drinking was likely to\r\noccur; there was no sound through all the house but the ticking of a\r\ngreat clock in the hall, which made itself audible in the very garrets;\r\nand sometimes a dull cooing of young gentlemen at their lessons, like\r\nthe murmurings of an assemblage of melancholy pigeons.\"--Dr. Blimber's\r\nmust have been, I think, somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Bedford\r\nHotel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THACKERAY'S PRAISE]\r\n\r\nAmong other writers who have found Brighton good to work in I might name\r\nthe authors of _The Strange Adventures of a Phaeton_ and _A System of\r\nSynthetic Philosophy_. Mr. William Black was for many years a familiar\r\nfigure on the Kemp Town parade, and Brighton plays a part in at least\r\ntwo of his charming tales--_The Beautiful Wretch_, and an early and very\r\nsprightly novel called _Kilmeny_. Brighton should be proud to think that\r\nMr. Herbert Spencer chose her as a retreat in which to come to his\r\nconclusions; but I doubt if she is. Thackeray's affection is, however,\r\ncherished by the town, his historic praise of \"merry cheerful Dr.\r\nBrighton\" having a commercial value hardly to be over-estimated.\r\nBrighton in return gave Thackeray Lord Steyne's immortal name and served\r\nas a background for many of his scenes.\r\n\r\nAlthough Brighton has still a fishing industry, the spectacle of its\r\nfishermen refraining from work is not an uncommon one. It was once the\r\ncustom, I read, and perhaps still is, for these men, when casting their\r\nnets for mackerel or herring, to stand with bare heads repeating in\r\nunison these words: \"There they goes then. God Almighty send us a\r\nblessing it is to be hoped.\" As each barrel (which is attached to every\r\ntwo nets out of the fleet, or 120 nets) was cast overboard they would\r\ncry:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Watch, barrel, watch! Mackerel for to catch,\r\n     White may they be, like a blossom on a tree.\r\n     God send thousands, one, two, and three,\r\n     Some by their heads, some by their tails,\r\n     God sends thousands, and never fails.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the last net was overboard the master said, \"Seas all!\" and then\r\nlowered the foremast and laid to the wind. If he were to say, \"Last\r\nnet,\" he would expect never to see his nets again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BRIGHTON'S FAIR DAUGHTERS]\r\n\r\n\"There are more handsome women in Brighton than anywhere else in the\r\nworld,\" wrote Richard Jefferies some twenty years ago. \"They are so\r\ncommon that gradually the standard of taste in the mind rises, and\r\ngood-looking women who would be admired in other places pass by without\r\nnotice. Where all the flowers are roses you do not see a rose.\" (Shirley\r\nBrooks must have visited Brighton on a curiously bad day, for seeing no\r\npretty face he wrote of it as \"The City of the Plain.\") Richard\r\nJefferies, who lived for a while at Hove, blessed also the treelessness\r\nof Brighton. Therein he saw much of its healing virtue. \"Let nothing,\"\r\nhe wrote, \"cloud the descent of those glorious beams of sunlight which\r\nfall at Brighton. Watch the pebbles on the beach; the foam runs up and\r\nwets them, almost before it can slip back, the sunshine has dried them\r\nagain. So they are alternately wetted and dried. Bitter sea and glowing\r\nlight, bright clear air, dry as dry--that describes the place. Spain is\r\nthe country of sunlight, burning sunlight; Brighton is a Spanish town in\r\nEngland, a Seville.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PAVILION]\r\n\r\nThe principal inland attraction of Brighton is still the Pavilion, which\r\nis indeed the town's symbol. On passing through its very numerous and\r\nfantastic rooms one is struck by their incredible smallness. Sidney\r\nSmith's jest (if it were his; I find Wilberforce, the Abolitionist,\r\nsaying something similar) is still unimproved: \"One would think that\r\nSt. Paul's Cathedral had come to Brighton and pupped.\" Cobbett in his\r\nrough and homely way also said something to the point about the Prince's\r\npleasure-house: \"Take a square box, the sides of which are three feet\r\nand a half, and the height a foot and a half. Take a large Norfolk\r\nturnip, cut off the green of the leaves, leave the stalks nine inches\r\nlong, tie these round with a string three inches from the top, and put\r\nthe turnip on the middle of the top of the box. Then take four turnips\r\nof half the size, treat them in the same way, and put them on the\r\ncorners of the box. Then take a considerable number of bulbs of the\r\ncrown-imperial, the narcissus, the hyacinth, the tulip, the crocus, and\r\nothers; let the leaves of each have sprouted to about an inch, more or\r\nless according to the size of the bulb; put all these, pretty\r\npromiscuously, but pretty thickly, on the top of the box. Then stand off\r\nand look at your architecture.\"\r\n\r\nTo its ordinary museum in the town Brighton has added the collection of\r\nstuffed birds made by the late Mr. E. T. Booth, which he housed in a\r\nlong gallery in the road that leads to the Dyke. Mr. Booth, when he shot\r\na bird in its native haunts, carried away some of its surroundings in\r\norder that the taxidermist might reproduce as far as possible its\r\nnatural environment. Hence every case has a value that is missing when\r\none sees merely the isolated stuffed bird. In one instance realism has\r\ndictated the addition of a clutch of pipit's eggs found on the Bass\r\nRock, in a nest invisible to the spectator. The collection in the\r\nNatural History Museum at South Kensington is of course more\r\nconsiderable, and finer, but some of Mr. Booth's cases are certainly\r\nsuperior, and his collection has the special interest of having been\r\nmade by one man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CRITICISM BY JUG]\r\n\r\nBrighton has another very interesting possession in the collection of\r\nold domestic pottery in the museum: an assemblage (the most entertaining\r\nand varied that I know) of jugs and mugs, plates and ornaments, all\r\nEnglish, all quaint and characteristic too, and mostly inscribed with\r\nmottoes or decorated with designs in celebration of such events as the\r\nbattle of Waterloo, or the discomfiture of Mr. Pitt, or a victory of Tom\r\nCribb. Others are ceramic satires on the drunkard's folly or the\r\ninconstancy of women. Why are the potters of our own day so dull?\r\nHistory is still being made, human nature is not less frail; but I see\r\nno genial commentary on jug or dish. Is it the march of Taste?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nROTTINGDEAN AND WHEATEARS\r\n\r\n     Ovingdean--Charles II.--The introduction of Mangel\r\n     Wurzel--Rottingdean as a shrine--Mr. Kipling's Sussex poem--Thomas\r\n     Fuller on the Wheatear--Mr. Hudson's description of the traps--The\r\n     old prosperous days for shepherds--Luring larks--A fight on the\r\n     beach--The town that failed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond Kemp Town's serene and silent line of massive houses is the new\r\nroad that leads to Rottingdean. The old road fell into the sea some few\r\nyears ago--the fourth or fifth to share that fate. But the pleasantest\r\nway thither is on foot over the turf that tops the white cliffs.\r\n\r\nBy diverging inland between Brighton and Rottingdean, just beyond the\r\nmost imposing girls' school in the kingdom, Ovingdean is reached, one of\r\nthe nestling homesteads of the Downs. It is chiefly known as providing\r\nHarrison Ainsworth with the very pretty title of one of his stories,\r\n_Ovingdean Grange_. The gallant novelist, however, was a poor historian\r\nin this book, for Charles the Second, as we have seen, never set foot\r\neast of Brighton on the occasion of his journey of escape over the\r\nSussex Downs. The legend that lodges him at Ovingdean, although one can\r\nunderstand how Ovingdean must cherish it, cannot stand. (Mock Beggars'\r\nHall, in the same romance, is Southover Grange at Lewes.)\r\n\r\nPeace hath her victories no less renowned than war. Ovingdean is famous\r\nnot only for its false association with Charles the Second but as the\r\nburial place of Thomas Pelling, an old-time Vicar, \"the first person who\r\nintroduced Mangul Wurzel into England.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROTTINGDEAN]\r\n\r\nRottingdean to-day must be very much of the size of Brighton two\r\ncenturies ago, before fashion came upon it; but the little village is\r\nhardly likely ever to creep over its surrounding hills in the same way.\r\nThe past few years, however, have seen its growth from an obscure and\r\ninaccessible settlement to a shrine. It is only of quite recent date\r\nthat a glimpse of Rottingdean has become almost as necessary to the\r\nBrighton visitor as the journey to the Dyke. Had the Legend of the Briar\r\nRose never been painted; had Mulvaney, Ortheris and Learoyd remained\r\nunchronicled and the British soldier escaped the label \"Absent-minded\r\nBeggar,\" Rottingdean might still be invaded only occasionally; for it\r\nwas when, following Sir Edward Burne-Jones, Mr. Rudyard Kipling found\r\nthe little white village good to make a home in, that its public life\r\nbegan. Although Mr. Kipling has now gone farther into the depths of the\r\ncounty, and the great draughtsman, some of whose stained glass designs\r\nare in the church, is no more, the habit of riding to Rottingdean is\r\nlikely, however, to persist in Brighton. The village is quaint and\r\nsimple (particularly so after the last 'bus is stabled), but it is\r\nvaluable rather as the key to some of the finest solitudes of the Downs,\r\nin the great uninhabited hill district between the Race Course at\r\nBrighton and Newhaven, between Lewes and the sea, than for any merits of\r\nits own. One other claim has it, however, on the notice of the pilgrim:\r\nWilliam Black lies in the churchyard.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"BLUE GOODNESS OF THE WEALD\"]\r\n\r\nMr. Kipling, as I have said, has now removed his household gods farther\r\ninland, to Burwash, but his heart and mind must be still among the\r\nDowns. The Burwash country, good as it is, can (I think) never inspire\r\nhim to such verse as he wrote in _The Five Nations_ on the turf hills\r\nabout his old home:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     No tender-hearted garden crowns,\r\n       No bosomed woods adorn\r\n     Our blunt, bow-headed, whale-backed Downs,\r\n       But gnarled and writhen thorn--\r\n     Bare slopes where chasing shadows skim,\r\n       And through the gaps revealed\r\n     Belt upon belt, the wooded, dim\r\n       Blue goodness of the Weald.\r\n\r\n     Clean of officious fence or hedge,\r\n       Half-wild and wholly tame,\r\n     The wise turf cloaks the white cliff edge\r\n       As when the Romans came.\r\n     What sign of those that fought and died\r\n       At shift of sword and sword?\r\n     The barrow and the camp abide,\r\n       The sunlight and the sward.\r\n\r\n     Here leaps ashore the full Sou'west\r\n       All heavy-winged with brine,\r\n     Here lies above the folded crest\r\n       The Channel's leaden line;\r\n     And here the sea-fogs lap and cling,\r\n       And here, each warning each,\r\n     The sheep-bells and the ship-bells ring\r\n       Along the hidden beach.\r\n\r\n     We have no waters to delight\r\n       Our broad and brookless vales--\r\n     Only the dewpond on the height\r\n       Unfed, that never fails,\r\n     Whereby no tattered herbage tells\r\n       Which way the season flies--\r\n     Only our close-bit thyme that smells\r\n       Like dawn in Paradise.\r\n\r\n     Here through the strong and salty days\r\n       The unshaded silence thrills;\r\n     Or little, lost, Down churches praise\r\n       The Lord who made the Hills:\r\n     But here the Old Gods guard their round,\r\n       And, in her secret heart,\r\n     The heathen kingdom Wilfrid found\r\n       Dreams, as she dwells, apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WHEATEARS]\r\n\r\nOf old the best wheatear country was above Rottingdean; but the South\r\nDown shepherds no longer have the wheatear money that used to add so\r\nappreciably to their wages in the summer months. A combination of\r\ncircumstances has brought about this loss. One is the decrease in\r\nwheatears, another the protection of the bird by law, and a third the\r\nrefusal of the farmers to allow their men any longer to neglect the\r\nflocks by setting and tending snares. But in the seventeenth, eighteenth\r\nand early part of the nineteenth centuries, wheatears were taken on the\r\nDowns in enormous quantities and formed a part of every south county\r\nbanquet in their season. People visited Brighton solely to eat them, as\r\nthey now go to Greenwich for whitebait and to Colchester for oysters.\r\n\r\nThis is how Fuller describes the little creature in the\r\n_Worthies_--\"_Wheatears_ is a bird peculiar to this County, hardly found\r\nout of it. It is so called, because fattest when Wheat is ripe, whereon\r\nit feeds; being no bigger than a Lark, which it equalleth in _fineness_\r\nof the flesh, far exceedeth in the _fatness_ thereof. The worst is, that\r\nbeing onely seasonable in the heat of summer, and naturally larded with\r\nlumps of fat, it is soon subject to corrupt, so that (though abounding\r\nwithin _fourty_ miles) _London Poulterers_ have no mind to meddle with\r\nthem, which no care in carriage can keep from Putrefaction. That\r\n_Palate-man_ shall pass in silence, who, being seriously demanded his\r\njudgment concerning the abilities of a great _Lord_, concluded him a man\r\nof very weak parts, '_because once he saw him, at a_ great Feast, _feed\r\non_ CHICKENS _when there were_ WHEATEARS _on the Table_.' I will adde no\r\nmore in praise of this _Bird_, for fear some _female Reader_ may fall in\r\n_longing_ for it, and unhappily be disappointed of her desire.\" A\r\ncontemporary of Fuller, John Taylor, from whom I have already quoted,\r\nand shall quote again, thus unscientifically dismisses the wheatear in\r\none of his doggerel narratives:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Six weeks or thereabouts they are catch'd there,\r\n     And are well-nigh 11 months God knows where.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the winter home of the wheatear is Africa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SHEPHERDS' TRAPS]\r\n\r\nThe capture of wheatears--mostly illegally by nets--still continues in a\r\nvery small way to meet a languid demand, but the Sussex ortolan, as the\r\nlittle bird was sometimes called, has passed from the bill of fare.\r\nWheatears (which, despite Fuller, have no connection with ears of wheat,\r\nthe word signifying white tail) still abound, skimming over the turf in\r\nlittle groups; but they no longer fly towards the dinner table. The best\r\nand most interesting description that I know of the old manner of taking\r\nthem, is to be found in Mr. W. H. Hudson's _Nature in Downland_. The\r\nseason began in July, when the little fat birds rest on the Downs on\r\ntheir way from Scotland and northern England to their winter home, and\r\nlasted through September. In July, says Mr. Hudson, the \"Shepherds made\r\ntheir 'coops,' as their traps were called--a T-shaped trench about\r\nfourteen inches long, over which the two long narrow sods cut neatly out\r\nof the turf were adjusted, grass downwards. A small opening was left at\r\nthe end for ingress, and there was room in the passage for the bird to\r\npass through towards the chinks of light coming from the two ends of the\r\ncross passage. At the inner end of the passage a horse-hair springe was\r\nset, by which the bird was caught by the neck as it passed in, but the\r\nnoose did not as a rule strangle the bird. On some of the high downs\r\nnear the coast, notably at Beachy Head, at Birling Gap, at Seaford, and\r\nin the neighbourhood of Rottingdean, the shepherds made so many coops,\r\nplaced at small distances apart, that the Downs in some places looked as\r\nif they had been ploughed. In September, when the season was over, the\r\nsods were carefully put back, roots down, in the places, and the smooth\r\ngreen surface was restored to the hills.\"\r\n\r\nOn bright clear days few birds would be caught, but in showery weather\r\nthe traps would all be full; this is because when the sun is obscured\r\nwheatears are afraid and take refuge under stones or in whatever hole\r\nmay offer. The price of each wheatear was a penny, and it was the\r\ncustom of the persons in the neighbourhood who wanted them for dinner to\r\nvisit the traps, take out the birds and leave the money in their place.\r\nThe shepherd on returning would collect his gains and reset the traps.\r\nNear Brighton, however, most of the shepherds caught only for dealers;\r\nand one firm, until some twenty years ago, maintained the practice of\r\ngiving an annual supper at the end of the season, at which the shepherds\r\nwould be paid in the mass for their spoil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A RECORD BAG]\r\n\r\nAn old shepherd, who had been for years on Westside Farm near Brighton,\r\nspoke thus, in 1882, as Mr. Borrer relates in his _Birds of\r\nSussex_:--\"The most I ever caught in one day was thirteen dozen, but we\r\nthought it a good day if we caught three or four dozen. We sold them to\r\na poulterer at Brighton, who took all we could catch in a season at\r\n18_d._ a dozen. From what I have heard from old shepherds, it cannot be\r\ndoubted that they were caught in much greater numbers a century ago than\r\nof late. I have heard them speak of an immense number being taken in one\r\nday by a shepherd at East Dean, near Beachy Head. I think they said he\r\ntook nearly a hundred dozen, so many that they could not thread them on\r\ncrow-quills in the usual manner, but he took off his round frock and\r\nmade a sack of it to put them into, and his wife did the same with her\r\npetticoat. This must have happened when there was a great flight. Their\r\nnumbers now are so decreased that some shepherds do not set up any\r\ncoops, as it does not pay for the trouble.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LARK-GLASS]\r\n\r\nAlthough wheatears are no longer caught, the Brighton bird-catcher is a\r\nvery busy man. Goldfinches fall in extraordinary plenty to his nets. A\r\nbird-catcher told Mr. Borrer that he once caught eleven dozen of them at\r\none haul, and in 1860 the annual take at Worthing was 1,154 dozen. Larks\r\nare also caught in great numbers, also with nets, the old system still\r\npractised in France, of luring them with glasses, having become\r\nobsolete. Knox has an interesting description of the lark-glass and its\r\nuses:--\"A piece of wood about a foot and a half long, four inches deep,\r\nand three inches wide, is planed off on two sides so as to resemble the\r\nroof of a well-known toy, yclept a Noah's ark, but, more than twice as\r\nlong. In the sloping sides are set several bits of looking-glass. A long\r\niron spindle, the lower end of which is sharp and fixed in the ground,\r\npasses freely through the centre; on this the instrument turns, and even\r\nspins rapidly when a string has been attached and is pulled by the\r\nperformer, who generally stands at a distance of fifteen or twenty yards\r\nfrom the decoy. The reflection of the sun's rays from these little\r\nrevolving mirrors seems to possess a mysterious attraction for the\r\nlarks, for they descend in great numbers from a considerable height in\r\nthe air, hover over the spot, and suffer themselves to be shot at\r\nrepeatedly without attempting to leave the field or to continue their\r\ncourse.\"\r\n\r\nTo return to Rottingdean, it was above the village, seven hundred years\r\nago, that a \"sore scrymmysche\" occurred between the French and the\r\nCluniac prior of Lewes. The prior was defeated and captured, but the\r\nnature of his resistance decided the enemy that it was better perhaps to\r\nretreat to their boats. The holy man, although worsted, thus had the\r\nsatisfaction of having proved to the King that a Cluniac monk in this\r\ncountry, was not, as was supposed at court, necessarily on the side of\r\nEngland's foes, even though they were of his own race.\r\n\r\nAccording to the scheme of this book, we should now return to Brighton;\r\nbut, as I have said, the right use to which to put Rottingdean is as the\r\nstarting point for a day among the hills. Once out and above the\r\nvillage, the world is your own. A conspiracy to populate a part of the\r\nDowns near the sea, a mile or so to the east of Rottingdean, seems\r\ngloriously to have failed, but what was intended may be learned from the\r\nskeleton roads that, duly fenced in, disfigure the turf. They even have\r\nnames, these unlovely parallelograms: one is Chatsworth Avenue, and\r\nAmbleside Avenue another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nSHOREHAM\r\n\r\n     Hove the impeccable--The Aldrington of the past--A digression on\r\n     seaports--Old Shoreham and history--Mr. Swinburne's poem--A baby\r\n     saint--Successful bribery--The Adur--Old Shoreham church and\r\n     bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cliffs that make the coast between Newhaven and Brighton so\r\nattractive slope gradually to level ground at the Aquarium and never\r\nreappear in Sussex on the Channel's edge again, although in the east\r\nthey rise whiter and higher, with a few long gaps, all the way to Dover.\r\nIt is partly for this reason that the walk from Brighton to Shoreham has\r\nno beauty save of the sea. Hove, which used to be a disreputable little\r\nsmuggling village sufficiently far from Brighton for risks to be run\r\nwith safety, is now the well-ordered home of wealthy rectitude. Mrs.\r\nGrundy's sea-side home is here. Hove is, perhaps, the genteelest town in\r\nthe world, although once, only a poor hundred years ago, there was no\r\nservice in the church on a certain Sunday, because, as the clerk\r\ninformed the complaisant vicar, \"The pews is full of tubs and the pulpit\r\nfull of tea\"--a pleasant fact to reflect upon during Church Parade amid\r\nthe gay yet discreet prosperity of the Brunswick Lawns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _New Shoreham Church._]\r\n\r\nWest of Hove, and between that town and Portslade-by-Sea, is Aldrington.\r\nAldrington is now new houses and brickfields. Thirty years ago it was\r\nnaught. But five hundred years ago it was the principal township in\r\nthese parts, and Brighthelmstone a mere insignificant cluster of hovels.\r\nCenturies earlier it was more important still, for, according to some\r\nauthorities, it was the Portus Adurni of the Romans. The river Adur,\r\nwhich now enters the sea between Shoreham and Southwick, once flowed\r\nalong the line of the present canal and the Wish Pond, and so out into\r\nthe sea. I have seen it stated that the mouth of the river was even more\r\neasterly still--somewhere opposite the Norfolk Hotel at Brighton; but\r\nthis may be fanciful and can now hardly be proven. The suggestion,\r\nhowever, adds interest to a walk on the otherwise unromantic Brunswick\r\nLawns. In those days the Roman ships, entering the river here, would\r\nsail up as far as Bramber. Between the river and the sea were then some\r\ntwo miles--possibly more--of flat meadow land, on which Aldrington was\r\nlargely built. Over the ruins of that Aldrington the Channel now washes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LIFE OF A HARBOUR]\r\n\r\nBeyond Aldrington is Portslade, with a pretty inland village on the\r\nhill; beyond Portslade is Southwick, notable for its green; and beyond\r\nSouthwick is Shoreham. Southwick and Shoreham both have that interest\r\nwhich can never be wanting to the seaport that has seen better days. The\r\nlife of a harbour, whatever its state of decay, is eternally absorbing;\r\nand in Shoreham harbour one gets such life at its laziest. The smell of\r\ntar; the sound of hammers; the laughter and whistling of the loafers;\r\nthe continuous changing of the tide; the opening of the lock gates; the\r\ndeparture of the tug; its triumphant return, leading in custody a\r\ntimber-laden barque from the Baltic, a little self-conscious and\r\nashamed, as if caught red-handed in iniquity by this fussy little\r\nofficer; the independent sailing of a grimy steamer bound for Sunderland\r\nand more coal; the elaborate wharfing of the barque:--all these things\r\non a hot still day can exercise an hypnotic influence more real and\r\nstrange than the open sea. The romance and mystery of the sea may indeed\r\nbe more intimately near one on a harbour wharf than on the deck of a\r\nliner in mid-ocean.\r\n\r\nShoreham has its place in history. Thence as we have seen, sailed\r\nCharles II. in Captain Tattersall's _Enterprise_. Four hundred and\r\nfifty years earlier King John landed here with his army, when he came to\r\nsucceed to the English throne. In the reign of Edward III. Shoreham\r\nsupplied twenty-six ships to the Navy: but in the fifteenth century the\r\nsea began an encroachment on the bar which disclassed the harbour. It is\r\nnow unimportant, most of the trade having passed to Newhaven; but in its\r\ndays of prosperity great cargoes of corn and wine were landed here from\r\nthe Continent.\r\n\r\nWhen people now say Shoreham they mean New Shoreham, but Old Shoreham is\r\nthe parent. Old Shoreham, however, declined to village state when the\r\npresent harbour was made.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MR. SWINBURNE'S POEM]\r\n\r\nNew Shoreham church, quite the noblest in the county, dates probably\r\nfrom about 1100. It was originally the property of the Abbey of Saumur,\r\nto whom it was presented, together with Old Shoreham church, by William\r\nde Braose, the lord of Bramber Castle. It is New Shoreham Church which\r\nMr. Swinburne had in mind (or so I imagine) in his noble poem \"On the\r\nSouth Coast\":--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Strong as time, and as faith sublime,--clothed round with shadows\r\n         of hopes and fears,\r\n     Nights and morrows, and joys and sorrows, alive with passion of\r\n         prayers and tears,--\r\n     Stands the shrine that has seen decline eight hundred waxing and\r\n         waning years.\r\n\r\n     Tower set square to the storms of air and change of season that\r\n         glooms and glows,\r\n     Wall and roof of it tempest-proof, and equal ever to suns and snows,\r\n     Bright with riches of radiant niches and pillars smooth as a\r\n         straight stem grows.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Stately stands it, the work of hands unknown of: statelier, afar\r\n         and near,\r\n     Rise around it the heights that bound our landward gaze from the\r\n         seaboard here;\r\n     Downs that swerve and aspire, in curve and change of heights that\r\n         the dawn holds dear.\r\n\r\n     Dawn falls fair on the grey walls there confronting dawn, on the\r\n         low green lea,\r\n     Lone and sweet as for fairies' feet held sacred, silent and strange\r\n         and free,\r\n     Wild and wet with its rills; but yet more fair falls dawn on the\r\n         fairer sea.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Rose-red eve on the seas that heave sinks fair as dawn when the\r\n         first ray peers;\r\n     Winds are glancing from sunbright Lancing to Shoreham, crowned with\r\n         the grace of years;\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Old Shoreham Bridge._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A SHOREHAM EPITAPH]\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard there was once (and may be still, but I did not find\r\nit) an epitaph on a child of eight months, in the form of a dialogue\r\nbetween the deceased and its parents. It contained these lines:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"'I trust in Christ,' the blessed babe replied,\r\n     Then smil'd, then sigh'd, then clos'd its eyes and died.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Old Shoreham Church._]\r\n\r\nShoreham's notoriety as a pocket borough--it returned two members to\r\nParliament, who were elected in the north transept of the church--came\r\nto a head in 1701, when the naïve means by which Mr. Gould had proved\r\nhis fitness were revealed. It seemed that Mr. Gould, who had never been\r\nto Shoreham before, directed the crier to give notice with his bell that\r\nevery voter who came to the King's Arms would receive a guinea in which\r\nto drink Mr. Gould's good health. This fact being made public by the\r\ndefeated candidate, Mr. Gould was unseated. At the following election,\r\nsuch was the enduring power of the original guinea, he was elected\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAfter the life of the harbour, the chief interest of Shoreham is its\r\nriver, the Adur, a yellow, sluggish, shallow stream, of great width near\r\nthe town, which at low tide dwindles into a streamlet trickling through\r\na desert of mud, but at the full has the beauty of a lake. Mr.\r\nSwinburne, in the same poem from which I have been quoting, thus\r\ndescribes the river at evening:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Skies fulfilled with the sundown, stilled and splendid, spread as a\r\n         flower that spreads,\r\n     Pave with rarer device and fairer than heaven's the luminous\r\n         oyster-beds,\r\n     Grass-embanked, and in square plots ranked, inlaid with gems that\r\n         the sundown sheds.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MR. HENLEY'S POEM]\r\n\r\nTo the Adur belongs also another lyric. It is printed in _Hawthorn and\r\nLavender_, to which I have already referred, and is one of Mr. Henley's\r\nmost characteristic and remarkable poems:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     In Shoreham River, hurrying down\r\n     To the live sea,\r\n     By working, marrying, breeding, Shoreham Town,\r\n     Breaking the sunset's wistful and solemn dream,\r\n     An old, black rotter of a boat\r\n     Past service to the labouring, tumbling flote,\r\n     Lay stranded in mid-stream;\r\n     With a horrid list, a frightening lapse from the line,\r\n     That made me think of legs and a broken spine;\r\n     Soon, all too soon,\r\n     Ungainly and forlorn to lie\r\n     Full in the eye\r\n     Of the cynical, discomfortable moon\r\n     That, as I looked, stared from the fading sky,\r\n     A clown's face flour'd for work. And by and by\r\n     The wide-winged sunset wanned and waned;\r\n     The lean night-wind crept westward, chilling and sighing;\r\n     The poor old hulk remained,\r\n     Stuck helpless in mid-ebb. And I knew why--\r\n     Why, as I looked, my heart felt crying.\r\n     For, as I looked, the good green earth seemed dying--\r\n     Dying or dead;\r\n     And, as I looked on the old boat, I said:--\r\n     \"_Dear God, it's I!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Adur is no longer the home of birds that once it was, but in the\r\nearly morning one may still see there many of the less common water\r\nfowl. The road to Portsmouth is carried across the Adur by the Norfolk\r\nSuspension Bridge, to cross which one must pay a toll,--not an\r\nunpleasant reminder of earlier days.\r\n\r\nOld Shoreham, a mile up the river, is notable for its wooden bridge\r\nacross the Adur to the Old Sussex Pad, at one time a famous inn for\r\nsmugglers. Few Royal Academy exhibitions are without a picture of Old\r\nShoreham Bridge and the quiet cruciform church at its eastward end.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LOYAL CLERK]\r\n\r\nA pleasant story tells how, in some Sussex journey, William IV. and his\r\nqueen chanced to be passing through Shoreham, coming from Chichester to\r\nLewes, one Sunday morning. The clerk of Old Shoreham church caught sight\r\nthrough the window of the approaching cavalcade, and leaping to his\r\nfeet, stopped the sermon by announcing: \"It is my solemn duty to inform\r\nyou that their Majesties the King and Queen are just now crossing the\r\nbridge.\" Thereupon the whole congregation jumped up and ran out to show\r\ntheir loyalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL'S DYKE AND HURSTPIERPOINT\r\n\r\n     Sussex and Leith Hill--The Dyke hill--Two recollections--Bustard\r\n     hunting on the Downs--The Queen of the gipsies--The Devil in\r\n     Sussex--The feeble legend of the\r\n     Dyke--Poynings--Newtimber--Pyecombe and shepherds' crooks--A\r\n     Patcham smuggler--Wolstonbury--Danny--An old Sussex\r\n     diary--Fish-culture in the past--Thomas Marchant's Sunday\r\n     head-aches--Albourne and Bishop Juxon--Twineham and Squire\r\n     Stapley--Zoological remedies--How to make oatmeal pudding.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Poynings, from the Devil's Dyke._]\r\n\r\nHad the hill above the Devil's Dyke--for the Dyke itself wins only a\r\npassing glance--been never popularised, thousands of Londoners, and many\r\nof the people of Brighton, would probably never have seen the Weald from\r\nany eminence at all. The view is bounded north and west only by hills:\r\non the north by the North Downs, with Leith Hill standing forward, as if\r\nadvancing to meet a southern champion, and in the west, Blackdown, Hind\r\nHead and the Hog's Back. The patchwork of the Weald is between. The view\r\nfrom the Dyke Hill, looking north, is comparable to that from Leith\r\nHill, looking south; and every day in fine weather there are tourists on\r\nboth of these altitudes gazing towards each other. The worst slight that\r\nSussex ever had to endure, so far as my reading goes, is in Hughson's\r\n_London ... and its Neighbourhood_, 1808, where the view from Leith Hill\r\nis described. After stating that the curious stranger on the summit\r\n\"feels sensations as we may suppose Adam to have felt when he\r\ninstantaneously burst into existence and the beauties of Eden struck his\r\nall-wondering eyes,\" Mr. Hughson describes the prospect. \"It commands\r\na view of the county of Surrey, part of Hampshire, Berkshire, Nettlebed\r\nin Oxfordshire, some parts of Bucks, Hertfordshire, Middlesex, Kent and\r\nEssex; and, by the help of a glass, Wiltshire.\" Not a word of Sussex.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A SEA OF MIST]\r\n\r\nThe wisest course for the non-gregarious traveller is to leave the Dyke\r\non the right, and, crossing the Ladies' Golf Links, gain Fulking Hill,\r\nfrom which the view is equally fine (save for lacking a little in the\r\neast) and where there is peace and isolation. I remember sitting one\r\nSunday morning on Fulking Hill when a white mist like a sea filled the\r\nWeald, washing the turf slopes twenty feet or so below me. In the depths\r\nof this ocean, as it were, could be heard faintly the noises of the\r\nfarms and the chime of submerged bells. Suddenly a hawk shot up and\r\ndisappeared again, like a leaping fish.\r\n\r\nThe same spot was on another occasion the scene of a superb effort of\r\ncourageous tenacity. I met a large hare steadily breasting the hill.\r\nTurning neither to the right nor left it was soon out of sight over the\r\ncrest. Five or more minutes later there appeared in view, on the hare's\r\ntrail, a very tired little fox terrier not much more than half the size\r\nof the hare. He also turned aside neither to the right nor the left, but\r\npanted wearily yet bravely past me, and so on, over the crest, after his\r\nprey. I waited for some time but the terrier never came back. Such was\r\nthe purpose depicted on his countenance that I can believe he is\r\nfollowing still.\r\n\r\nOn these Downs, near the Dyke, less than a century ago the Great Bustard\r\nused to be hunted with greyhounds. Mr. Borrer tells us in the _Birds of\r\nSussex_ that his grandfather (who died in 1844) sometimes would take\r\nfive or six in a morning. They fought savagely and more than once\r\ninjured the hounds.\r\n\r\nEnterprise has of late been at work at the Dyke. A cable railway crosses\r\nthe gully at a dizzy height, a lift brings travellers from the Weald, a\r\nwooden cannon of exceptional calibre threatens the landscape, and\r\npictorial advertisements of the Devil and his domain may be seen at most\r\nof the Sussex stations. Ladies also play golf where, when first I knew\r\nit, one could walk unharmed. A change that is to be regretted is the\r\nexile to the unromantic neighbourhood of the Dyke Station of the Queen\r\nof the Gipsies, a swarthy ringletted lady of peculiarly comfortable\r\nexterior who, splendid (yet a little sinister) in a scarlet shawl and\r\nponderous gold jewels, used once to emerge from a tent beside the Dyke\r\ninn and allot husbands fair or dark. She was an astute reader of her\r\nfellows, with an eye too searching to be deceived by the removal of\r\ntell-tale rings. A lucky shot in respect to a future ducal husband of a\r\nyoung lady now a duchess, of the accuracy of which she was careful to\r\nremind you, increased her reputation tenfold in recent years. Her name\r\nis Lee, and of her title of Queen of the Gipsies there is, I believe,\r\nsome justification.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"HE\"]\r\n\r\nSussex abounds in evidences of the Devil's whimsical handiwork, although\r\nin ordinary conversation Sussex rustics are careful not to speak his\r\nname. They say \"he.\" Mr. Parish, in his _Dictionary of the Sussex\r\nDialect_, gives an example of the avoidance of the dread name: \"'In the\r\nDown there's a golden calf buried; people know very well where it is--I\r\ncould show you the place any day.' 'Then why don't they dig it up? 'Oh,\r\nit's not allowed: _he_ wouldn't let them.' 'Has any one ever tried?' 'Oh\r\nyes, but it's never there when you look; _he_ moves it away.'\" His\r\npunchbowl may be seen here, his footprints there; but the greatest of\r\nhis enterprises was certainly the Dyke. His purpose was to submerge or\r\nsilence the irritating churches of the Weald, by digging a ditch that\r\nshould let in the sea. He began one night from the North side, at\r\nSaddlescombe, and was working very well until he caught sight of the\r\nbeams of a candle which an old woman had placed in her window. Being a\r\nDevil of Sussex rather than of Miltonic invention, he was not clever,\r\nand taking the candle light for the break of dawn, he fled and never\r\nresumed the labour. That is the very infirm legend that is told and sold\r\nat the Dyke.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HANGLETON]\r\n\r\nI might just mention that the little church which one sees from the Dyke\r\nrailway, standing alone on the hill side, is Hangleton. Dr. Kenealy, who\r\ndefended the Claimant, is buried there. The hamlet of Hangleton, which\r\nmay be seen in the distance below, once possessed a hunting lodge of the\r\nCoverts of Slaugham, which, after being used as labourers' cottages, has\r\nnow disappeared. The fine Tudor mansion of the Bellinghams', now\r\ntransformed into a farm house, although it has been much altered, still\r\nretains many original features. In the kitchen, no doubt once the hall,\r\non an oak screen, are carved the Commandments, followed by this\r\ningenious motto, an exercise on the letter E:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Persevere, ye perfect men,\r\n     Ever keep these precepts ten.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hangleton House._]\r\n\r\nFrom the Dyke hill one is within easy walking distance of many Wealden\r\nvillages. Immediately at the north end of the Dyke itself is Poynings,\r\nwith its fine grey cruciform church raising an embattled tower among\r\nthe trees on its mound. It has been conjectured from the similarity of\r\nthis beautiful church to that of Alfriston that they may have had the\r\nsame architect. Poynings (now called Punnings) was of importance in\r\nNorman times, and was the seat of William FitzRainalt, whose descendants\r\nafterwards took the name of de Ponyngs and one of whom was ennobled as\r\nBaron de Ponyngs. In the fifteenth century the direct line was merged\r\ninto that of Percy. The ruins of Ponyngs Place, the baronial mansion,\r\nare still traceable.\r\n\r\nFollowing the road to the west, under the hills, we come first to\r\nFulking (where one may drink at a fountain raised by a brewer to the\r\nglory of God and in honour of John Ruskin), then to Edburton (where the\r\nleaden font, one of three in Sussex, should be noted), then to Truleigh,\r\nall little farming hamlets shadowed by the Downs, and so to Beeding and\r\nBramber, or, striking south, to Shoreham.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NEWTIMBER]\r\n\r\nIf, instead of turning into Poynings, one ascends the hill on the other\r\nside of the stream, a climb of some minutes, with a natural amphitheatre\r\non the right, brings one to the wooded northern escarpment of\r\nSaddlescombe North Hill, or Newtimber Hill, which offers a view little\r\ninferior to that of the Dyke. At Saddlescombe, by the way, lives one of\r\nthe most learned Sussex ornithologists of the day, and a writer upon the\r\nnatural history of the county (so cavalierly treated in this book!), for\r\nwhose quick eye and descriptive hand the readers of _Blackwood_ have\r\nreason to be grateful. Immediately beneath Newtimber Hill lies\r\nNewtimber, consisting of a house or two, a moated grange, and a little\r\nchurch, which, though only a few yards from the London road, is so\r\nhidden that it might be miles from everywhere. On the grass bank of the\r\nbostel descending through the hanger to Newtimber, I counted on one\r\nspring afternoon as many as a dozen adders basking in the sun. We are\r\nhere, though so near Brighton, in country where the badger is still\r\nfound, while the Newtimber woods are famous among collectors of moths.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PYECOMBE CROOKS]\r\n\r\nIf you are for the Weald it is by this bostel that you should descend,\r\nbut if still for the Downs turn to the east along the summit, and you\r\nwill come to Pyecombe, a straggling village on each side of the London\r\nroad just at the head of Dale Hill. Pyecombe has lost its ancient fame\r\nas the home of the best shepherds' crooks, but the Pyecombe crook for\r\nmany years was unapproached. The industry has left Sussex: crooks are\r\nnow made in the north of England and sold over shop counters. I say\r\n\"industry\" wrongly, for what was truly an industry for a Pyecombe\r\nblacksmith is a mere detail in an iron factory, since the number of\r\nshepherds does not increase and one crook will serve a lifetime and\r\nmore. An old shepherd at Pyecombe, talking confidentially on the subject\r\nof crooks, complained that the new weapon as sold at Lewes, although\r\nnominally on the Pyecombe pattern, is a \"numb thing.\" The chief reason\r\nwhich he gave was that the maker was out of touch with the man who was\r\nto use it. His own crook (like that of Richard Jefferies' shepherd\r\nfriend) had been fashioned from the barrel of an old muzzle-loader. The\r\npresent generation, he added, is forgetting how to make everything: why,\r\nhe had neighbours, smart young fellows, too, who could not even make\r\ntheir own clothes.\r\n\r\nPyecombe is but a few miles from Brighton, which may easily be reached\r\nfrom it. A short distance south of the village is the Plough Inn, the\r\npoint at which the two roads to London--that by way of Clayton Hill,\r\nFriar's Oak, Cuckfield, Balcombe and Redhill, and the other (on which we\r\nare now standing) by way of Dale Hill, Bolney, Hand Cross, Crawley and\r\nReigate--become one.\r\n\r\nOn the way to Brighton from the Plough one passes through Patcham, a\r\ndusty village that for many years has seen too many bicycles, and now is\r\nin the way of seeing too many motor cars. In the churchyard is, or was,\r\na tomb bearing the following inscription, which may be quoted both as a\r\nreminder of the more stirring experiences to which the Patcham people\r\nwere subject a hundred years ago, and also as an example of the truth\r\nwhich is only half a truth:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SMUGGLER AND EXEMPLAR]\r\n\r\n     Sacred to the memory of Daniel Scales, who was unfortunately shot\r\n     on Thursday Evening, Nov. 7, 1796.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Alas! swift flew the fatal lead\r\n     Which pierced through the young man's head,\r\n     He instant fell, resigned his breath,\r\n     And closed his languid eyes in death.\r\n     All ye who do this stone draw near,\r\n     Oh! pray let fall the pitying tear.\r\n     From the sad instance may we all\r\n     Prepare to meet Jehovah's call.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts of the case bear some likeness to the death of Mr. Bardell and\r\nSerjeant Buzfuz's reference to that catastrophe. Daniel Scales was a\r\ndesperate smuggler who, when the fatal lead pierced him, was heavily\r\nladen with booty. He was shot through the head only as a means of\r\npreventing a similar fate befalling his slayer.\r\n\r\nJust beyond Patcham, as we approach Brighton, is the narrow chalk lane\r\non the left which leads to the Lady's Mile, the beginning of a superb\r\nstretch of turf around an amphitheatre in the hills by which one may\r\ngallop all the way to the Clayton mills. The grass ride extends to\r\nLewes.\r\n\r\nPreston, once a village with an independent life, is now Brighton; but\r\nnothing can harm its little English church, noticeable for a fresco of\r\nthe murder of Thomas à Becket, a representation dating probably from the\r\nreign of Edward I.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is a digression, and we must return to Pyecombe in order\r\nto climb Wolstonbury--the most mountainous of the hills in this part,\r\nand indeed, although far from the highest, perhaps the noblest in mien\r\nof the whole range, by virtue of its isolation and its conical shape.\r\nThe earthworks on Wolstonbury, although supposed to be of Celtic origin,\r\nwere probably utilised by the Romans for military purposes. More than\r\nany of the Downs does Wolstonbury bring before one the Roman occupation\r\nof our country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DANNY]\r\n\r\nImmediately below Wolstonbury, on the edge of the Weald, is Danny, an\r\nElizabethan house, to-day the seat of the Campions, but two hundred and\r\nmore years ago the seat of Peter Courthope, to whom John Ray dedicated\r\nhis _Collection of English Words not generally used_, and before then\r\nthe property of Sir Simon de Pierpoint. The park is small and without\r\ndeer, but the house has a façade of which one can never tire. I once saw\r\n_Twelfth Night_ performed in its gardens, and it was difficult to\r\nbelieve that Shakespeare had not the spot in mind when he wrote that\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Malthouse Farm, Hurstpierpoint._]\r\n\r\nThe Danny drive brings us to Hurstpierpoint, or Hurst as it is generally\r\ncalled, which is now becoming a suburb of Brighton and thus somewhat\r\nlosing its character, but which the hills will probably long keep sweet.\r\nJames Hannington, Bishop of Equatorial East Africa, who was murdered by\r\nnatives in 1885, was born here; here lived Richard Weeks, the antiquary;\r\nand here to-day is the home of Mr. Mitten, most learned of Sussex\r\nbotanists.\r\n\r\nTo Hurst belongs one of the little Sussex squires to whose diligence as\r\na diarist we are indebted for much entertaining knowledge of the past.\r\nLittle Park, now the property of the Hannington family, where Thomas\r\nMarchant, the diarist in question, lived, and kept his journal between\r\n1714 and 1728, is to the north of the main street, lying low. The\r\noriginal document I have not seen, but from passages printed by the\r\nSussex Archæological Society I borrow a few extracts for the light they\r\nthrow on old customs and social life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FISH-BREEDING]\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"October 8th, 1714. Paid 4_s._ at Lewes for 1/4 lb., of tea; 5_d._\r\n     for a quire of paper; and 6_d._ for two mousetraps.\r\n\r\n     \"October 29th, 1714. Went to North Barnes near Homewood Gate to see\r\n     the pond fisht. I bought all the fish of a foot long and upwards at\r\n     50_s._ per C. I am to give Mrs. Dabson 200 store fish, over and\r\n     above the aforesaid bargain; but she is to send to me for them.\r\n\r\n     \"October 30th, 1714. We fetched 244 Carps in three Dung Carts from\r\n     a stew of Parson Citizen at Street; being brought thither last\r\n     night out of the above pond.\r\n\r\n     \"October 31st, 1714 (Sunday). I could not go to Church, being\r\n     forced to stay at home to look after, and let down fresh water to,\r\n     the fish; they being--as I supposed--sick, because they lay on the\r\n     surface of the pond and were easily taken out. But towards night\r\n     they sunk.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Little Park ponds still exist, but the practice of breeding fish has\r\npassed. In Arthur Young's _General View of the Agriculture of the County\r\nof Sussex_, 1808, quoted elsewhere in this book, is a chapter on fish,\r\nwherein he writes: \"A Mr. Fenn of London, has long rented, and is the\r\nsole monopolizer of, all the fish that are sold in Sussex. Carp is the\r\nchief stock; but tench and perch, eels and pike are raised. A stream\r\nshould always flow through the pond; and a marley soil is the best. Mr.\r\nMilward has drawn carp from his marl-pits 25lb. a brace, and two inches\r\nof fat upon them, but then he feeds with pease. When the waters are\r\ndrawn off and re-stocked, it is done with stores of a year old, which\r\nremain four years: the carp will then be 12 or 13 inches long, and if\r\nthe water is good, 14 or 15. The usual season for drawing the water is\r\neither Autumn or Spring: the sale is regulated by measure, from the eye\r\nto the fork of the tail. At twelve inches, carp are worth 50_s._ and\r\n3_l._ per hundred; at fifteen inches, 6_l._; at eighteen inches, 8_l._\r\nand 9_l._ A hundred stores will stock an acre; or 35 brace, 10 or 12\r\ninches long, are fully sufficient for a breeding pond. The first year\r\nthey will be three inches long; second year, seven; third year, eleven\r\nor twelve; fourth year, fourteen or fifteen. This year they breed.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THOMAS MARCHANT'S HEADACHES]\r\n\r\nAlthough fish-breeding is not what it was, many of the Sussex ponds are\r\nstill regularly dragged, and the proceeds sold in advance to a London\r\nfirm. Sometimes the purchaser wins in the gamble, sometimes the seller.\r\nThe fish are removed alive, in large tanks, and sold as they are wanted,\r\nchiefly for Jewish tables. But we must return to Thomas Marchant:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"January 16th (Sunday) 1715. I was not at church having a bad\r\n     headache.\r\n\r\n     \"January 25th, 1715. We had a trout for supper, two feet two inches\r\n     long from eye to fork, and six inches broad; it weighed\r\n     ten-and-a-half pounds. It was caught in the Albourne Brook, near\r\n     Trussell House.... We staid very late and drank enough.\r\n\r\n     \"April 15th, 1715.

The western high road between Brighton and London passes\r\nwithin a stone's throw of Albourne, but one never suspects the\r\nexistence, close by, of this retired village, so compact and virginal\r\nand exquisitely old fashioned. It is said that after the execution of\r\nCharles I Bishop Juxon lived for a while at Albourne Place during the\r\nCivil War, and once escaped the Parliamentary soldiers by disguising\r\nhimself as a bricklayer. There is a priest's hiding hole in the house.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A GIANT TROUT]\r\n\r\nSome three miles north of Albourne is Twineham, another village which,\r\nsituated only on a by-road midway between two lines of railway, has also\r\npreserved its bloom. Here, at the end of the seventeenth and beginning\r\nof the eighteenth centuries, at Hickstead Place, a beautiful Tudor\r\nmansion that still stands, lived Richard Stapley, another of the Sussex\r\ndiarists whose MSS. have been selected for publication by the Sussex\r\nArchæological Society. I quote a few passages:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"In ye month of November, 1692, there was a trout found in ye\r\n     Poyningswish, in Twineham, which was 29 inches long from ye top of\r\n     ye nose to ye tip of ye taile; and John fflint had him and eat him.\r\n     He was left in a low slank after a fflood, and ye water fell away\r\n     from him, and he died. The fish I saw at John fflint's house ye\r\n     Sunday after they had him: and at night they boiled him for supper,\r\n     but could not eat one halfe of him; and there was six of them at\r\n     supper; John fflint and his wife Jane, and four of their children;\r\n     and ye next day they all fell on him again, and compassed him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we have the spectacle of a good man struggling with\r\naccuracy:--\"August 19th, 1698. Paid Mr. Stheward for Dr. Comber's\r\nparaphrase on ye Common Prayer, 20_s._ and 6_d._ for carriage. I paid it\r\nat ye end of ye kitchen table next ye chamber stairs door, and nobody\r\nin ye room but he and I. No, it was ye end of ye table next ye parlour.\r\n\r\n\"April 26th, 1709. I bought a salmon-trout of William Lindfield of\r\nGrubbs, in Bolney, which he caught ye night before in his net, by his\r\nold orchard, which was wounded by an otter. The trout weighed 11 lbs.\r\nand 1/2; and was 3 foot 2 inches long from end to end, and but 2 foot 9\r\ninches between ye eye and ye forke.\" There is also a record of a salmon\r\ntrout being caught at Bolney early in the last century, which weighed\r\n22lbs. and was sent to King George IV. at Brighton.\r\n\r\nI must quote a prescription from the diary:--\"To cure the\r\nhoopingcough:--get 3 field mice, flaw them, draw them, and roast one of\r\nthem, and let the party afflicted eat it; dry the other two in the oven\r\nuntil they crumble to a powder, and put a little of this powder in what\r\nthe patient drinks at night and in the morning.\" Mice played, and still\r\nplay in remote districts, a large part in the rural pharmacopeia. A\r\nSussex doctor once told me that he had directed the mother of a boy at\r\nPortslade to put some ice in a bag and tie it on the boy's forehead.\r\nWhen, the next day, the doctor asked after his patient, the mother\r\nreplied briskly:--\"Oh, Tommy's better, but the mice are dead.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OATMEAL PUDDING]\r\n\r\nThe Stapley family ate an oatmeal pudding made in the following\r\nmanner:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Of oats decorticated take two pound,\r\n     And of new milk enough the same to dround;\r\n     Of raisins of the sun, ston'd, ounces eight;\r\n     Of currants, cleanly picked, an equal weight;\r\n     Of suet, finely sliced, an ounce at least;\r\n     And six eggs newly taken from the nest;\r\n     Season this mixture well with salt and spice;\r\n     Twill make a pudding far exceeding nice;\r\n     And you may safely feed on it like farmers.\r\n     For the receipt is learned Dr. Harmer's.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE GOOD HORSE'S REWARD]\r\n\r\nRichard Stapley's diary was continued by his son Anthony and grandson\r\nJohn. The most pleasing among the printed extracts is this:--\"1736, May\r\nthe 21st. The white horse was buried in the saw-pit in the Laine's wood.\r\nHe was aged about thirty-five years, as far as I could find of people\r\nthat knew him foaled. He had been in his time as good a horse as ever\r\nman was owner of, and he was buried in his skin being a good old\r\nhorse.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ditchling._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nDITCHLING\r\n\r\n     Stanmer Park and Dr. Johnson--The Roman way down Ditchling\r\n     Beacon--Sussex folk in London--Jacob's Post--The virtues of\r\n     gibbets--Mr. John Burgess's diary.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother good walk from Brighton begins with a short railway journey to\r\nFalmer on the Lewes line. Then strike into Stanmer Park, the seat of the\r\nEarl of Chichester, a descendant of the famous Sussex Pelhams, with the\r\nchurch and the little village of Stanmer on the far edge of it, and so\r\nup through the hollows and valleys to Ditchling Beacon. Dr. Johnson's\r\nsaying of the Downs about Brighton, that \"it was a country so truly\r\ndesolate that if one had a mind to hang oneself for desperation at being\r\nobliged to live there, it would be difficult to find a tree on which to\r\nfasten a rope,\" proves beyond question that his horse never took him\r\nStanmer way, for the park is richly wooded.\r\n\r\nOn Ditchling Beacon, one of the noblest of the Sussex hills and the\r\nsecond if not the first in height of all the range (the surveys differ,\r\none giving the palm to Duncton) the Romans had a camp, and the village\r\nof Ditchling may still be gained by the half-subterranean path that our\r\nconquerors dug, so devised that a regiment might descend into the Weald\r\nunseen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON'S VASTNESS]\r\n\r\nDitchling is a quiet little village on high ground, where Alfred the\r\nGreat once had a park. The church is a very interesting and graceful\r\nspecimen of early English architecture, dating from the 13th century. A\r\nhundred and more years ago water from a chalybeate spring on the common\r\nwas drunk by Sussex people for rheumatism and other ills; but the spring\r\nhas lost its fame. The village could not well be more out of the\r\nmovement, yet an old lady living in the neighbourhood who, when about to\r\nvisit London for the first time, was asked what she expected to find,\r\nreplied, \"Well, I can't exactly tell, but I suppose something like the\r\nmore bustling part of Ditchling.\" A kindred story is told of a Sussex\r\nman who, finding himself in London for the first time, exclaimed with\r\nastonishment--\"What a queer large place! Why, it ain't like Newick and\r\nit ain't like Chailey.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Old House at Ditchling._]\r\n\r\nOn Ditchling Common are the protected remains of a stake known as\r\nJacob's Post. A stranger requested to supply this piece of wood with the\r\norigin of its label would probably adventure long before hitting upon\r\nthe right tack; for Jacob, whose name has in this familiar connection a\r\npopular and almost an endearing sound, was Jacob Harris, a Jew pedlar of\r\nastonishing turpitude, who, after murdering three persons at an inn on\r\nDitchling Common and plundering their house, was hanged at Horsham in\r\nthe year 1734, and afterwards suspended, as a lesson, to the gibbet, of\r\nwhich this post--Jacob's Post--is the surviving relic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A CURE FOR TOOTHACHE]\r\n\r\nAll gibbets, it is said, are \"good\" for something, and a piece of\r\nJacob's Post carried on the person is sovran against toothache. A Sussex\r\narchæologist tells of an old lady, a resident on Ditchling Common for\r\nmore than eighty years, whose belief in the Post was so sound that her\r\npocket contained a splinter of it long after all her teeth had departed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JOHN BURGESS'S DIARY]\r\n\r\nFrom extracts from the diary of Mr. John Burgess, tailor, sexton and\r\nParticular Baptist, of Ditchling, which are given in the Sussex\r\nArchæological Collections, I quote here and there:--\r\n\r\n    \"August 1st, 1785. There was a cricket match at Lingfield Common\r\n    between Lingfield in Surrey and all the county of Sussex, supposed\r\n    to be upwards of 2,000 people.\r\n\r\n    \"June 29th, 1786.

Fortunately Cuckfield, which has two coaching\r\ninns and many of the signs of the leisurely past, is close by, in the\r\nmidst of very interesting country, with a church standing high on the\r\nridge to the south of the town, broadside to the Weald, its spire a\r\nlandmark for miles. Cuckfield Place (a house and park, according to\r\nShelley, which abounded in \"bits of Mrs. Radcliffe\") is described in\r\nHarrison Ainsworth's _Rookwood_. It was in the avenue leading from the\r\ngates to the house that that fatal tree stood, a limb of which fell as\r\nthe presage of the death of a member of the family. So runs the legend.\r\nKnowledge of the tree is, however, disclaimed by the gatekeeper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cuckfield Church._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE COACHMAN'S PLANS]\r\n\r\nOckenden House, in Cuckfield, has been for many years in the possession\r\nof the Burrell family, one of whom, Timothy Burrell, an ancestor of the\r\nantiquary, left some interesting account books, which contain in\r\naddition to figures many curious and sardonic entries and some ingenious\r\nhieroglyphics. I quote here and there, from the Sussex Archæological\r\nSociety's extracts, by way of illustrating the life of a Sussex squire\r\nin those days, 1683-1714:--\r\n\r\n1705. \"Pay'd Gosmark for making cyder 1 day, whilst John Coachman was to\r\nbe drunk with the carrier's money, by agreement; and I pay'd 2_d._ to\r\nthe glasyer for mending John's casement broken at night by him when he\r\nwas drunk.\r\n\r\n\"1706. 25th March.

Plumm pottage.\r\n     Calves' head and bacon.           Boiled beef, a clod.\r\n     Goose.                            Two baked puddings.\r\n     Pig.

Put\r\nfine bread, sliced, soaked, and crumbled; raisins of the sun, currants\r\nand pruants two lbs. of each; lemons, nutmegs, mace and cloves are to be\r\nboiled with it in a muslin bag; add a quart of red wine and let this be\r\nfollowed, after half an hour's boiling, by a pint of sack. Put it into a\r\ncool place and it will keep through Christmas.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Burrell giving a small dinner to four friends, offered them\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Pease pottage.\r\n     2 carps. 2 tench.

Minced pies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not surprising that the host had occasionally to take the\r\nwaters of Ditchling, which are no longer drunk medicinally, or to dose\r\nhimself with hieræ picræ.\r\n\r\nOne more dinner, this time for four guests, who presumably were more\r\nworthy of attention:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     A soup take off.\r\n     Two large carps at the upper end.\r\n     Pidgeon pie, salad, veal ollaves,\r\n     Leg of mutton, and cutlets at the lower end.\r\n     Three rosed chickens.\r\n     Scotch pancakes, tarts, asparagus.\r\n     Three green gees at the lower end.\r\n     In the room of the chickens removed,\r\n     Four-souced Mackerel.\r\n     Rasins in cream at the upper end.\r\n     Calves' foot jelly, dried sweetmeats, calves' foot jelly.\r\n     Flummery, Savoy cakes.\r\n     Imperial cream at the lower end.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn October, 1709, Mr. Burrell writes in Latin: \"From this time I have\r\nresolved, as long as the dearth of provisions continues, to give to the\r\npoor who apply for it at the door on Sundays, twelve pounds of beef\r\nevery week, on the 11th of February 4lbs. more, in all 16lbs., and a\r\nbushel of wheat and half a bushel of barley in 4 weeks.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MERRY ANDREW]\r\n\r\nFrom Borde Hill to the north-east of Cuckfield, is supposed to have come\r\nAndrew Boord, the original Merry Andrew. Among the later Boords who\r\nlived there was George Boord, in whose copy of _Natura Brevium_ and\r\n_Tenores Novelli_, bound together (given him by John Sackville of\r\nChiddingly Park) is written:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Sidera non tot habet Celum, nec flumina pisces,\r\n     Quot scelera gerit femina mente dolos.\r\n                             Dixit Boordus;\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich Mr. Lower translates:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Quoth Boord, with stars the skies abound,\r\n       With fish the flowing waters;\r\n     But far more numerous I have found\r\n       The tricks of Eve's fair daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Boord would be a relative of the famous Andrew, priest, doctor and\r\nsatirist (1490-1549) who may indeed have been the author of the distich\r\nabove. It is certainly in his vein.\r\n\r\nAndrew Boord gave up his vows as a Carthusian on account of their\r\n\"rugorosite,\" and became a doctor, travelling much on the Continent.\r\nSeveral books are known to be his, chief among them the _Dyetary_ and\r\n_Brevyary of Health_. He wrote also an _Itinerary of England_ and is\r\ncredited by some with the _Merrie Tales of the Mad Men of Gotham_. Lower\r\nand Horsfield indeed hold that the Gotham intended was not the\r\nNottinghamshire village but Gotham near Pevensey, where Boord had\r\nproperty. That he knew something of Sussex is shown by _Boord's Boke of\r\nKnowledge_, where he mentions the old story, then a new one, that no\r\nnightingale will sing in St. Leonard's Forest. It is the _Boke of\r\nKnowledge_ that has for frontispiece the picture of a naked Englishman\r\nwith a pair of shears in one hand and a piece of cloth over the other\r\narm, saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n     I am an English man and naked I stand here,\r\n     Musing in my mund what rayment I shall were;\r\n     For now I wyll were this, and now I wyl were that;\r\n     Now I wyl were I cannot tel what.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall see Andrew again when we come to Pevensey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OLD WILLS]\r\n\r\nA glimpse of the orderly mind of a pre-Reformation Cuckfield yeoman is\r\ngiven in a will quoted recently in the _Sussex Daily News_, in an\r\ninteresting series of articles on the county under the title of\r\n\"Old-time Sussex\":\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"In the yere of our lorde god 1545. the 26 day of June, I, Thomas\r\n     Gaston, of the pish of Cukefelde, syke in body, hole, and of ppt\r\n     [perfect] memorie, ordene and make this my last will and test, in\r\n     manr. and forme folling.\r\n\r\n     Fyrst I bequethe my sowle to Almyghty god or [our] lady St. Mary\r\n     and all the holy company of heyvyng, my bodie to be buried in the\r\n     church yarde of Cukefeld.\r\n\r\n     It.

In one of these Sussex\r\nwills, in 1594, Richard Phearndeane, a labourer, left to his brother\r\nStephen his best dublett, his best jerkin and his best shoes, and to\r\nBernard Rosse his white dublett, his leathern dublett and his worst\r\nbreeches.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE BELLS OF BOLNEY]\r\n\r\nThree miles west of Cuckfield is Bolney, just off the London road, a\r\nvillage in the southern boundary of St. Leonard's Forest, the key to\r\nsome very rich country. Before the days of bicycles Bolney was\r\npractically unknown, so retired is it. The church, which has a curious\r\npinnacled tower nearly 300 years old, is famous for its bells,\r\nconcerning whose melody Horsfield gives the following piece of counsel:\r\n\"Those who are fond of the silvery tones of bells, may enjoy them to\r\nperfection, by placing themselves on the margin of a large pond, the\r\nproperty of Mr. W. Marshall; the reverberation of the sound, coming off\r\nthe water, is peculiarly striking.\"\r\n\r\nSixty years ago this sheet of water had an additional attraction. Says\r\nMr. Knox, \"During the months of May and June, 1843, an osprey was\r\nobserved to haunt the large ponds near Bolney. After securing a fish he\r\nused to retire to an old tree on the more exposed bank to devour it, and\r\nabout the close of evening was in the habit of flying off towards the\r\nnorth-west, sometimes carrying away a prize in his talons if his sport\r\nhad been unusually successful, as if he dreaded being disturbed at his\r\nrepast during the dangerous hours of twilight. Having been shot at\r\nseveral times without effect, his visits to these ponds became gradually\r\nless frequent, but the surrounding covers being unpreserved, and the\r\nbird itself too wary to suffer a near approach, he escaped the fate of\r\nmany of his congeners, and even re-appeared with a companion early in\r\nthe following September, to whom he seemed to have imparted his salutary\r\ndread of man--his mortal enemy--for during the short time they remained\r\nthere it was impossible to approach within gunshot of either of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe indirect road from Bolney to Hand Cross, through Warninglid and\r\nSlaugham (parallel with the coaching road), is superb, taking us again\r\ninto the iron country and very near to Leonardslee, which we have\r\nalready seen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MAGNIFICENT COVERTS]\r\n\r\nThe glory of Slaugham Place is no more; but one visible sign of it is\r\npreserved in Lewes, in the Town Hall, in the shape of its old staircase.\r\nSlaugham Place was the seat of the Covert family, whose estates\r\nextended, says tradition, \"from Southwark to the Sea,\" and, says the\r\nmore exact Horsfield, from Crawley to Hangleton, above Brighton.\r\nSlaugham Park used to cover 1200 acres, the church being within it.\r\nPerhaps nowhere in Sussex is the change so complete as here, and within\r\nrecent times too, for Horsfield quotes, in 1835, the testimony of \"an\r\naged person, whom the present rector buried about twenty-five years\r\nback, who used to relate, that he remembered when the family at Slaugham\r\nPark, or Place, consisted of seventy persons.\" Horsfield continues, in a\r\nfootnote (the natural receptacle of many of his most interesting\r\nstatements):--\"The name of the aged person alluded to was Harding, who\r\ndied at nearly 100. According to his statement, the family were so\r\nnumerous, they kept constantly employed mechanics of every description,\r\nwho resided on the premises. A conduit, which supplied the mansion with\r\nwater, is now used by the inhabitants of the village. The kitchen\r\nfireplace still remains, of immense size, with the irons that supported\r\nthe cooking apparatus. The arms of the Coverts, with many impalements\r\nand quarterings, yet remain on the ruins. The principal entrance was\r\nfrom the east, and the grand front to the north. The pillars at the\r\nentrance, fluted, with seats on each side, are still there. According to\r\nthe statement of the above person, there was a chapel attached to the\r\nmansion at the west part. The mill-pond flowed over nearly 40 acres,\r\naccording to a person's statement who occupied the mill many years.\" The\r\nruins, little changed since Horsfield wrote, stand in a beautiful\r\nold-world garden, which the traveller must certainly endeavour to enter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE BRIGHTON ROAD]\r\n\r\nA mile north of Slaugham is Hand Cross, a Clapham Junction of highways,\r\nwhence Crawley is easily reached. Crawley, however, beyond a noble\r\nchurch, has no interest, its distinction being that it is halfway\r\nbetween London and Brighton on the high road--its distinction and its\r\nmisfortune. One would be hard put to it to think of a less desirable\r\nexistence than that of dwelling on a dusty road and continually seeing\r\npeople hurrying either from Brighton to London or from London to\r\nBrighton. Coaches, phaetons, motor cars, bicycles, pass through Crawley\r\nso numerously as almost to constitute one elongated vehicle, like the\r\nmoving platform at the last Paris Exhibition.\r\n\r\nAnd not only travellers on wheels; for since the fashion for walking\r\ncame in, Crawley has had new excitements, or monotonies, in the shape of\r\nwalking stockbrokers, walking butchers, walking auctioneers' clerks,\r\nwalking Austrians pushing their families in wheelbarrows, walking\r\nbricklayers carrying hods of bricks, walking acrobats on stilts--all\r\nstriving to get to Brighton within a certain time, and all accompanied\r\nby judges, referees, and friends. At Hand Cross, lower on the road, the\r\nnumbers diminish; but every competitor seems to be able to reach\r\nCrawley, perhaps because the railway station adjoins the high road. It\r\nwas not, for example, until he reached Crawley that the Austrian's\r\nwheelbarrow broke down.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LINDFIELD]\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the line, two miles north-east of Hayward's Heath,\r\nis Lindfield, with its fine common of geese, its generous duck-pond, and\r\nwide straggling street of old houses and new (too many new, to my mind),\r\nrising easily to the graceful Early English church with its slender\r\nshingled spire. Just beyond the church is one of the most beautiful of\r\ntimbered houses in Sussex, or indeed in England. When I first knew this\r\nhouse it was a farm in the hands of a careless farmer; it has been\r\nrestored by its present owner with the most perfect understanding and\r\ntaste. For too long no one attempted to do as much for East Mascalls, a\r\ntimbered ruin lying low among the fields to the east of the village; but\r\nquite recently it has been taken in hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _East Mascalls--before renovation._]\r\n\r\nA quaint Lindfield epitaph may be mentioned: that of Richard Turner, who\r\ndied in 1768, aged twenty-one:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Long was my pain, great was my grief,\r\n     Surgeons I'd many but no relief.\r\n     I trust through Christ to rise with the just:\r\n     My leg and thigh was buried first.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"IDLEHURST\"]\r\n\r\nI must not betray secrets, but it might be remarked that that kindly yet\r\nmelancholy study of Wealden people and Wealden scenery, called\r\n_Idlehurst_--the best book, I think, that has come out of Sussex in\r\nrecent years--may be read with some special appropriateness in this\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nNorth of Lindfield is Ardingly, now known chiefly in connection with the\r\nlarge school which travellers on the line to Brighton see from the\r\ncarriage windows as they cross the viaduct over the Ouse. The village, a\r\nmile north of the college, is famous as the birthplace of Thomas Box,\r\nthe first of the great wicket-keepers, who disdained gloves even to the\r\nfastest bowling. The church has some very interesting brasses to members\r\nof the Wakehurst and Culpeper families, who long held Wakehurst Place,\r\nthe Elizabethan mansion to the north of the village. Nicholas Culpeper\r\nof the _Herbal_ was of the stock; but he must not be confounded with the\r\nNicholas Culpeper whose brass, together with that of his wife, ten sons\r\nand eight daughters, is in the church, possibly the largest family on\r\nrecord depicted in that metal. The church also has a handsome canopied\r\ntomb, the occupant of which is unknown.\r\n\r\nFrom Ardingly superb walks in the Sussex forest country may be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nFOREST COUNTRY AGAIN\r\n\r\n     Balcombe--The iron furnace and the iron horse--Leonard Gale of\r\n     Tinsloe Forge--Mr. Wilfred Scawen Blunt of Crabbet--\"The Old\r\n     Squire\"--Frederick Locker-Lampson of Rowfant--The Rowfant\r\n     books--\"To F. L.\"--The Rowfant titmice.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn leaving the train at Balcombe, one is quickly on the densely wooded\r\nForest Ridge of Sussex, here fenced and preserved, but farther east,\r\nwhen it becomes Ashdown Forest, consisting of vast tracts of open\r\nmoorland and heather. Balcombe has a simple church, protected by a\r\nscreen of Scotch firs; its great merit is its position as the key to a\r\nparadise for all who like woodland travel. From Balcombe to Worth is one\r\nvast pheasant run, with here and there a keeper's cottage or a farm:\r\noriginally, of course, a series of plantations growing furnace wood for\r\nthe ironmasters. In Tilgate Forest, to the west of Balcombe Forest, are\r\ntwo large sheets of water, once hammer-ponds, walking west from which,\r\ntowards Horsham, one may be said to traverse the Lake Country of Sussex.\r\nA strange transformation, from Iron Black Country to Lake Country!--but\r\nnature quickly recovers herself, and were the true Black Country's\r\nfurnaces extinguished, she would soon make even that grimy tract a haunt\r\nof loveliness once more.\r\n\r\nNo longer are heard the sounds of the hammers, but Balcombe Forest,\r\nTilgate Forest, and Worth Forest have still a constant reminder of\r\nmachinery, for very few minutes pass from morning to night without the\r\nrumble of a train on the main line to Brighton, which passes through\r\nthe very midst of this wild game region, and plunges into the earth\r\nunder the high ground of Balcombe Forest. I know of no place where the\r\ntrains emit such a volume of sound as in the valley of the Stanford\r\nbrook, just north of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe noise makes it impossible ever quite to lose the sense of modernity\r\nin these woods, as one may on Shelley Plain, a few miles west, or at\r\nGill's Lap, in Ashdown Forest; unless, of course, one's imagination is\r\nso complaisant as to believe it to proceed from the old iron furnaces.\r\nThis reminds me that Crabbet, just to the north of Worth (where church\r\nand vicarage stand isolated on a sandy ridge on the edge of the Forest),\r\nwas the home of one of the most considerable of the Sussex ironmasters,\r\nLeonard Gale of Tinsloe Forge, who bought Crabbet, park and house, in\r\n1698--since \"building,\" in his own words, is a \"sweet impoverishing.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WORTH CHURCH]\r\n\r\nBut we must pause for a moment at Worth, because its church is\r\nremarkable as being the largest in England to preserve its Saxon\r\nfoundations. Sussex, as we have seen, is rich in Saxon relics, but the\r\ncounty has nothing more interesting than this. The church is cruciform,\r\nas all churches should be, and there is a little east window in the\r\nnorth transept through which, it is conjectured, arrows were intended to\r\nbe shot at marauding Danes; for an Englishman's church was once his\r\ncastle. Archæologists familiar with Worth church have been known to pass\r\nwith disdain cathedrals for which the ordinary person cannot find too\r\nmany fine adjectives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MR. BLUNT'S BALLAD]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE OLD SQUIRE]\r\n\r\nTo regain Crabbet. The present owner, Mr. Wilfred Scawen Blunt, poet,\r\npatriot, and breeder of Arab horses, who is a descendant of the Gales,\r\nhas a long poem entitled \"Worth Forest,\" wherein old Leonard Gale is a\r\nnotable figure. Among other poems by the lord of Crabbet is the very\r\npleasantly English ballad of\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE OLD SQUIRE.\r\n\r\n     I like the hunting of the hare\r\n       Better than that of the fox;\r\n     I like the joyous morning air,\r\n       And the crowing of the cocks.\r\n\r\n     I like the calm of the early fields,\r\n       The ducks asleep by the lake,\r\n     The quiet hour which Nature yields\r\n       Before mankind is awake.\r\n\r\n     I like the pheasants and feeding things\r\n       Of the unsuspicious morn;\r\n     I like the flap of the wood-pigeon's wings\r\n       As she rises from the corn.\r\n\r\n     I like the blackbird's shriek, and his rush\r\n       From the turnips as I pass by,\r\n     And the partridge hiding her head in a bush,\r\n       For her young ones cannot fly.\r\n\r\n     I like these things, and I like to ride\r\n       When all the world is in bed,\r\n     To the top of the hill where the sky grows wide,\r\n       And where the sun grows red.\r\n\r\n     The beagles at my horse heels trot,\r\n       In silence after me;\r\n     There's Ruby, Roger, Diamond, Dot,\r\n       Old Slut and Margery,--\r\n\r\n     A score of names well used, and dear,\r\n       The names my childhood knew;\r\n     The horn, with which I rouse their cheer,\r\n       Is the horn my father blew.\r\n\r\n     I like the hunting of the hare\r\n       Better than that of the fox;\r\n     The new world still is all less fair\r\n       Than the old world it mocks.\r\n\r\n     I covet not a wider range\r\n       Than these dear manors give;\r\n     I take my pleasures without change,\r\n       And as I lived I live.\r\n\r\n     I leave my neighbours to their thought;\r\n       My choice it is, and pride,\r\n     On my own lands to find my sport,\r\n       In my own fields to ride.\r\n\r\n     The hare herself no better loves\r\n       The field where she was bred,\r\n     Than I the habit of these groves,\r\n       My own inherited.\r\n\r\n     I know my quarries every one,\r\n       The meuse where she sits low;\r\n     The road she chose to-day was run\r\n       A hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n     The lags, the gills, the forest ways;\r\n       The hedgerows one and all,\r\n     These are the kingdoms of my chase,\r\n       And bounded by my wall.\r\n\r\n     Nor has the world a better thing,\r\n       Though one should search it round,\r\n     Than thus to live one's own sole king,\r\n       Upon one's own sole ground.\r\n\r\n     I like the hunting of the hare;\r\n       It brings me day by day,\r\n     The memory of old days as fair,\r\n       With dead men past away.\r\n\r\n     To these, as homeward still I ply,\r\n       And pass the churchyard gate,\r\n     Where all are laid as I must lie,\r\n       I stop and raise my hat.\r\n\r\n     I like the hunting of the hare;\r\n       New sports I hold in scorn.\r\n     I like to be as my fathers were,\r\n       In the days e'er I was born.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ROWFANT BOOKS]\r\n\r\nWe are indeed just now in a bookish and poetical district, for a little\r\nmore than a mile to the east of Crabbet, in a beautiful Tudor house in a\r\nhollow close to the station, lived Frederick Locker-Lampson, the London\r\nlyricist; and here are treasured the famous Rowfant books and\r\nmanuscripts which he brought together--the subject of graceful verses\r\nby many of his friends. Not the least charming of these tributes\r\n(printed in the _Rowfant Catalogue_ in 1886) are Mr. Andrew Lang's\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n\r\n                   TO F.

The contestants were a series of Titmice and the G.P.O., and\r\nthe account of the war may be read in the Natural History Museum at\r\nSouth Kensington:--\"In 1888, a pair of the Great Titmouse (_Parus\r\nmajor_) began to build their nest in the post-box which stood in the\r\nroad at Rowfant, and into which letters, &c., were posted and taken out\r\nby the door daily. One of the birds was killed by a boy, and the nest\r\nwas not finished. In 1889, a pair completed the nest, laid seven eggs,\r\nand began to sit; but one day, when an unusual number of post-cards were\r\ndropped into, and nearly filled, the box, the birds deserted the nest,\r\nwhich was afterwards removed with the eggs. In 1890, a pair built a new\r\nnest and laid seven eggs, and reared a brood of five young, although the\r\nletters posted were often found lying on the back of the sitting bird,\r\nwhich never left the nest when the door of the box was opened to take\r\nout the letters. The birds went in and out by the slit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nEAST GRINSTEAD\r\n\r\n     Sackville College--John Mason Neale--_Theodosius; or, The Force of\r\n     Love_, at the East Grinstead Theatre--Three martyrs--Brambletye\r\n     House--Forest Row--The garden of the author of _The English Flower\r\n     Garden_--Diamond Jubilee clock-faces--\"Big-on-Little\" and the\r\n     reverend and irreverend commentator.\r\n\r\n\r\nEast Grinstead, the capital of north-east Sussex, is interesting chiefly\r\nfor Sackville College, that haunt of ancient peace of which John Mason\r\nNeale, poet, enthusiast, divine, historian, and romance-writer for\r\nchildren, was for many years the distinguished Warden. Nothing can\r\nexceed the quiet restfulness of the quadrangle. The college gives\r\nshelter to five brethren and six sisters (one of whom shows the visitor\r\nover the building), and to a warden and two assistants. Happy\r\ncollegians, to have so fair a haven in which to pass the evening of\r\nlife. East Grinstead otherwise has not much beauty, its commanding\r\npinnacled church tower being more impressive from a distance, and its\r\nchief street mingling too much that is new with its few old timbered\r\nfaçades, charming though these are.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Judge's Houses, East Grinstead._]\r\n\r\nThe town, when it would be frivolous, to-day depends upon the occasional\r\nvisits of travelling entertainers; but in the eighteenth century East\r\nGrinstead had a theatre of its own, in the main street, a play-bill of\r\nwhich, for May, 1758, is given in Boaden's _Life of Mrs. Siddons_. It\r\nstates that \"Theodosius; or, the Force of Love,\" is to be played, for\r\nthe benefit of Mrs. P. Varanes by Mr. P., \"who will strive as far as\r\npossible to support the character of this fiery Persian Prince, in which\r\nhe was so much admired and applauded at Hastings, Arundel, Petworth,\r\nMidhurst, Lewes, &c.\" The attraction of the next announcement is the\r\nprecise converse: \"Theodosius, by a young gentleman from the University\r\nof Oxford, who never appeared on any stage.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NOBILITY AND THE ALTAR]\r\n\r\nThe play-bill continues with a delicate hint: \"Nothing in Italy can\r\nexceed the altar in the first scene of the play. Nevertheless, should\r\nany of the nobility or gentry wish to see it ornamented with flowers,\r\nthe bearer will bring away as many as they choose to favour him with.\"\r\nFinally: \"N.B.--The great yard dog that made so much noise on Thursday\r\nnight during the last act of King Richard the Third, will be sent to a\r\nneighbour's over the way.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sussex Martyrs, to whom a memorial, as we shall see, has recently\r\nbeen raised above Lewes, are usually associated with that town; but on\r\nJuly 18, 1556, Thomas Dungate, John Forman, and Anne, or Mother, Tree,\r\nwere burned for conscience' sake at East Grinstead.\r\n\r\nBetween East Grinstead and Forest Row, on the east, just under the hill\r\nand close to the railway, are the remains of Brambletye House, a rather\r\nflorid ruin, once the seat of the great Sussex family of Lewknor. In its\r\nheyday Brambletye must have been a very fine place. Horace Smith's\r\nromance which bears its name, and for which Horsfield, in his _History\r\nof Sussex_, predicted a career commensurable with that of the Waverley\r\nnovels, is now, I fear, justly forgotten. The slopes of Forest Row,\r\nwhich was of old a settlement of hunting lodges belonging to the great\r\nlords who took their pleasure in Ashdown Forest, are now bright with new\r\nvillas. From Forest Row, Wych Cross and Ashdown Forest are easily\r\ngained; but of this open region of dark heather more in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nBetween Kingscote and West Hoathly, a short distance to the south-west\r\nof East Grinstead, is another \"tye\"--Gravetye, a tudor mansion in a deep\r\nhollow, the home of Mr. William Robinson, the author of _The English\r\nFlower Garden_. Last April, the stonework, of which there is much, was a\r\nmass of the most wonderful purple aubretia, and the wild garden between\r\nthe house and the water a paradise of daffodils.\r\n\r\nThe church of West Hoathly (called West Ho-ly), which stands high on the\r\nhill to the south, has a slender shingled spire that may be seen from\r\nlong distances. The tower has, however, been injured by the very ugly\r\nnew clock that has been lately fixed in a position doubtless the most\r\nconvenient but doubtless also the least comely. To nail to such a\r\ndelicate structure as West Hoathly church the kind of dial that one\r\nexpects to see outside a railway station is a curious lapse of taste.\r\nHever church, in Kent, has a similar blemish, probably dating from one\r\nof the recent Jubilee celebrations, which left few loyal villages the\r\nricher by a beautiful memorial. Surely it should be possible to obtain\r\nan appropriate clock-face for such churches as these.\r\n\r\nWest Hoathly has some iron tombstones, such as used to be cast in the\r\nold furnace days, which are not uncommon in these parts. Opposite the\r\nchurch is a building of great antiquity, which has been allowed to\r\nforget its honourable age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"BIG-ON-LITTLE\"]\r\n\r\nWe are now on the fringe of the Sussex rock country, to which we come\r\nagain in earnest when we reach Maresfield, and of which Tunbridge Wells\r\nis the capital. But not even Tunbridge Wells with its famous toad has\r\nanything to offer more remarkable than West Hoathly's \"Big-on-Little,\"\r\nin the Rockhurst estate. I am tempted to quote two descriptions of the\r\nrock, from two very different points of view. An antiquary writing in\r\nthe eighteenth century (quoted by Horsfield) thus begins his\r\naccount:--\"About half a mile west of West Hoadley church there is a high\r\nridge covered with wood; the edge of this is a craggy cliff, composed of\r\nenormous blocks of sand stone. The soil hath been entirely washed from\r\noff them, and in many places, from the interstices by which they are\r\ndivided, one perceives these crags with bare broad white foreheads, and,\r\nas it were, overlooking the wood, which clothes the valley at their\r\nfeet. In going to the place, I passed across this deep valley, and was\r\nled by a narrow foot-path almost trackless up to the cliff, which seems\r\nas one advances to hang over one's head. The mind in this passage is\r\nprepared with all the suspended feelings of awe and reverence, and as\r\none approaches this particular rock, standing with its stupendous bulk\r\npoised, seemingly in a miraculous manner and point, one is struck with\r\namazement. The recess in which it stands hath, behind this rock, and the\r\nrocks which surround it, a withdrawn and recluse passage which the eye\r\ncannot look into but with an idea of its coming from some more secret\r\nand holy adyt. All these circumstances, in an age of tutored\r\nsuperstition, would give, even to the finest minds, the impressions that\r\nlead to idolatry.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COBBETT AGAIN]\r\n\r\nAnd this is Cobbett's description, in the _Rural Rides_:--\"At the place,\r\nof which I am now speaking, that is to say, by the side of this pleasant\r\nroad to Brighton, and between Turner's Hill and Lindfield, there is a\r\nrock, which they call '_Big upon Little_,' that is to say, a rock upon\r\nanother, having nothing else to rest upon, and the top one being longer\r\nand wider than the top of the one it lies on. This big rock is no\r\ntrifling concern, being as big, perhaps, as a not very small house. How,\r\nthen, _came_ this big upon little? What lifted up the big? It balances\r\nitself naturally enough; but what tossed it up? I do not like to _pay_ a\r\nparson for teaching me, while I have '_God's own Word_' to teach me; but\r\nif any parson will tell me _how_ big _came_ upon little, I do not know\r\nthat I shall grudge him a trifle. And if he cannot tell me this; if he\r\nsay, All that we have to do is to _admire_ and _adore_; then I tell him,\r\nthat I can admire and adore without his _aid_, and that I will keep my\r\nmoney in my pocket.\" That is pure Cobbett.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WEST HOATHLY]\r\n\r\nWest Hoathly is in the midst of some of the best of the inland country\r\nof Sussex and an excellent centre for the walker. Several places that we\r\nhave already seen are within easy distance, such as Horsted Keynes,\r\nWorth and Worth Forest and Balcombe and Balcombe Forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nHORSTED KEYNES TO LEWES\r\n\r\n     The origin of \"Keynes\"--The Rev.

Giles Moore,\r\nextracts from whose journals and account books, 1656-1679, have been\r\nprinted by the S.A.S. I quote a few passages:\r\n\r\n\"I gave my wyfe 15_s._ to lay out at St. James faire at Lindfield, all\r\nwhich shee spent except 2_s._ 6_d._ which she never returned mee.\r\n\r\n\"16th Sept.

The present peer, one of the\r\npatrons of modern Sussex cricket, took a famous team to Australia in\r\n1891-2, and it was on his yacht that in 1894 cricket was played in the\r\nIce Fiord at Spitzbergen under the midnight sun, when Alfred Shaw\r\ncaptured forty wickets in less than three-quarters of an hour.\r\nAustralian teams visiting England used to open their season with a match\r\nat Sheffield Park, which contains one of the best private grounds in the\r\ncountry; but the old custom has, I fancy, lapsed. In the long winter of\r\n1890-1 several cricket matches on the ice were played on one of the\r\nlakes in the park, with well-known Sussex players on both sides.\r\n\r\nSheffield Park is associated in literature with the name of Edward\r\nGibbon, the historian, who spent much time there in the company of his\r\nfriend, John Baker Holroyd, the first earl. Gibbon's remains lie in\r\nFletching church, close by. There also lies Peter Dynot, a glover of\r\nFletching, who assisted Jack Cade, the Sussex rebel, whom we meet later,\r\nin 1450; while (more history) it was in the woods around Fletching\r\nchurch that Simon de Montfort encamped before he climbed the hills, as\r\nwe are about to see, and fought and won the Battle of Lewes, in 1264.\r\n\r\nThe line passes next between Newick, on the east, and Chailey on the\r\nwest. Fate seems to have decided that these villages shall always be\r\nbracketed in men's minds, like Beaumont and Fletcher, or Winchelsea and\r\nRye: one certainly more often hears of \"Newick and Chailey\" than of\r\neither separately. Chailey has a wide breezy common from which the line\r\nof Downs between Ditchling Beacon and Lewes can be seen perhaps to their\r\nbest advantage. Immediately to the south, and just to the west of\r\nBlackcap, the hill with a crest of trees, is Plumpton Plain, six hundred\r\nfeet high, where the Barons formed their ranks to meet the third Harry\r\nin the Battle of Lewes, the actual fighting being on Mount Harry, the\r\nhill on Blackcap's east. A cross to mark the struggle, cut into the turf\r\nof the Plain, is still occasionally visible. More noticeable is the \"V\"\r\nin spruce firs planted on the escarpment to commemorate the Jubilee of\r\n1887.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SHEPHERD MATHEMATICIAN]\r\n\r\nPlumpton, which is now known chiefly for its steeplechases, has had in\r\nits day at least two interesting inhabitants. One was John Dudeney,\r\nshepherd, mathematician, and schoolmaster, born here in 1782, who, as a\r\nyouth, when tending his sheep on Newmarket Hill, dug a study and library\r\nin the chalk, and there kept his books and papers. He taught himself\r\nmathematics and languages, even Hebrew, and ultimately became a\r\nschoolmaster at Lewes. In his thorough adherence to learning Dudeney was\r\nthe completest contrast to John Kimber of Chailey, a wealthy farmer with\r\na consuming but unintelligent love of books, who was once, says\r\nHorsfield, seen bringing home Macklin's Bible, a costly work in six\r\nvolumes in a sack laid across the back of a cart horse. According to the\r\nexcellent habit of the old Sussex farmers, Mr. Kimber's body was borne\r\nto the grave in one of his wagons, drawn by his best team.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FANTASTIC FRUITS]\r\n\r\nPlumpton Place once had a moat, in which, legend has it, the first carp\r\nswam that came into England. The house then belonged to Leonard Mascall,\r\nwhom Fuller in the _Worthies_ erroneously ascribes to Plumsted. In\r\nFuller's own words, which no one could better: \"Leonard Mascall, of\r\nPlumsted in this county, being much delighted in Gardening, man's\r\nOriginal vocation, was the first who brought over into England, from\r\nbeyond the seas, _Carps_ and _Pippins_; the one, well-cook'd, delicious,\r\nthe other cordial and restorative. For the proof hereof, we have his own\r\nword and witness; and did it, it seems, about the Fifth year of the\r\nreign of King _Henry_ the Eighth, Anno Dom. 1514. The time of his death\r\nis to me unknown.\" The credit of introducing carps and pippins has,\r\nhowever, been denied to Mascall, who died in 1589 at Farnham Royal in\r\nBuckinghamshire, where he was buried; but we know him beyond question to\r\nhave been an ingenious experimentalist in horticulture. He wrote and\r\ntranslated several books, among them a treatise on the orchard by a monk\r\nof the Abbey of St. Vincent in France: _A Book of the Arte of and Manner\r\nhowe to plant and graffe all sortes of trees, howe to set stones, and\r\nsowe Pepines to make wylde trees to graffe on_, 1572. I take a few\r\npassages from a later edition of this work:\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLOUR APPLES.\r\n\r\nTo have coloured Apples with what colour ye shall think good ye shall\r\nbore or slope a hole with an Auger in the biggest part of the body of\r\nthe tree, unto the midst thereof, or thereabouts, and then look what\r\ncolour ye will have them of. First ye shall take water and mingle your\r\ncolour therewith, then stop it up again with a short pin made of the\r\nsame wood or tree, then wax it round about. Ye may mingle with the said\r\ncolour what spice ye list, to make them taste thereafter. Thus may ye\r\nchange the colour and taste of any Apple.... This must be done before\r\nthe Spring do come....\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE APPLES FALL FROM THE TREE.\r\n\r\nIf ye put fiery coles under an Apple tree, and then cast off the powder\r\nof Brimstone therein, and the fume thereof ascend up, and touch an Apple\r\nthat is wet, that Apple shall fall incontinant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DESTROY PISMIERS OR ANTS ABOUT A TREE.\r\n\r\nYe shall take of the saw-dust of Oke-wood oney, and straw that al about\r\nthe tree root, and the next raine that doth come, all the Pismiers or\r\nAnts shall die there. For Earewigges, shooes stopt with hay, and hanged\r\non the tree one night, they come all in.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR TO HAVE RATH MEDLARS TWO MONTHS BEFORE OTHERS.\r\n\r\nFor to have Medlars two months sooner than others and the one shall be\r\nbetter far than the other, ye shall graffe them upon a gooseberry tree,\r\nand also a franke mulberry tree, and before ye do graffe them, ye shall\r\nwet them in hay, and then graffe them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MALLING DEANERY]\r\n\r\nTo return to the line, for the excursion to Plumpton has taken us far\r\nfrom the original route, the next station to Newick and Chailey is\r\nBarcombe Mills, a watery village on the Ouse. The river valley contracts\r\nas Lewes is reached, with Malling Hill on the east and Offham Hill on\r\nthe west: both taking their names from two of the quaint little hamlets\r\nby which Lewes is surrounded. It was at Mailing Deanery that the\r\nassassins of Thomas à Becket sought shelter on their flight from\r\nCanterbury. The legend records how, when they laid their armour on the\r\nDeanery table, that noble piece of furniture rose and flung the accursed\r\naccoutrements to the ground.\r\n\r\nOn Malling Hill is the residence of a Lewes lady whose charitable\r\nimpulses have taken a direction not common among those who suffer for\r\nothers. She receives into her stable old and overworked horses, thus\r\nensuring for them a sleek and peaceful dotage enlivened by sugar and\r\ncarrots, and marked by the kindest consideration. The pyramidal grave\r\n(as of a Saxon chief) of one of these dependants may be seen from the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _On the Ouse above Lewes._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nLEWES\r\n\r\n     The Museum of Sussex--The riches of Lewes--Her leisure and\r\n     antiquity--A plea from _Idlehurst_--Old Lewes disabilities--The\r\n     Norman Conquest--Lewes Castle--Sussex curiosities--Lewes among her\r\n     hills--The Battle of Lewes--The Cluniac Priory--Repellers of the\r\n     French--A comprehender of Earthquakes--The author of _The Rights of\r\n     Man_--A game of bowls--\"Clio\" Rickman and Thomas Tipper--Famous\r\n     Lewes men--The Fifth of November--The Sussex martyrs.\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from the circumstance that the curiosities collected by the\r\ncounty's Archæological Society are preserved in the castle, Lewes is the\r\nmuseum of Sussex; for she has managed to compress into small compass\r\nmore objects of antiquarian interest than any town I know. Chichester,\r\nwhich is compact enough, sprawls by comparison.\r\n\r\nThe traveller arriving by train no sooner alights from his carriage than\r\nhe is on the site of the kitchens of the Cluniac Priory of St. Pancras,\r\nsome of the walls of which almost scrape the train on its way to\r\nBrighton. That a priory eight hundred years old must be disturbed before\r\na railway station can be built is a melancholy circumstance; but in the\r\npresent case the vandalism had its compensation in the discovery by the\r\nexcavating navvies of the coffins of William de Warenne and his wife\r\nGundrada (the Conqueror's daughter), the founders of the priory, which\r\notherwise would probably have been lost evermore.\r\n\r\nThe castle, which dominates the oldest part of the town, is but a few\r\nminutes' stiff climb from the station; Lewes's several ancient churches\r\nare within hailing distance of each other; the field of her battle,\r\nwhere Simon de Montfort defeated Henry III., is in view from her\r\nnorth-west slopes; while the new martyrs' memorial on the turf above the\r\nprecipitous escarpment of the Cliffe (once the scene of a fatal\r\navalanche) reminds one of what horrors were possible in the name of\r\nreligion in these streets less than four hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE RICHES OF LEWES]\r\n\r\nHere are riches enough; yet Lewes adds to such mementoes of an historic\r\npast two gaols--one civil and one naval--a racecourse, and a river, and\r\nshe is an assize town to boot. Once, indeed, Lewes was still better off,\r\nfor she had a theatre, which for some years was under the management of\r\nJack Palmer, of whom Charles Lamb wrote with such gusto. Added to these\r\npossessions, she has, in Keere Street, the narrowest and steepest\r\nthoroughfare down which a king (George IV.) ever drove a coach and four,\r\nand a row of comfortable and serene residences (on the way to St. Ann's)\r\nmore luxuriantly and beautifully covered with leaves than any I ever\r\nsaw. (Much of Lewes in September is scarlet with Virginia creeper.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _High Street, Southover._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"BRIGHTHELMSTONE, NEAR LEWES\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JOHN HALSHAM'S DREAM]\r\n\r\nAlthough less than half an hour from Brighton by train, and an hour by\r\nroad, Lewes is yet a full quarter of a century behind it. She would do\r\nwell jealously to maintain this interval. Lewes was old and grey before\r\nBrighton was thought of (indeed, it was, as we have seen, a Lewes man\r\nthat discovered Brighton--Dr. Russell, who lies in his grave in South\r\nMalling church); let her cling to her seniority. As a town \"in the\r\nmovement,\" as a contemporary of the \"Queen of Watering Places,\" she\r\nwould cut a poor figure. But it is amusing to think of the old address\r\nof a visitor to Brighton, \"at Brighthelmstone, near Lewes,\" and to read\r\nthe county paper, _The Sussex Weekly Advertiser; or, Lewes Journal_, of\r\na century ago, with its columns of Lewes news and paragraphs of Brighton\r\ncorrespondence. Lewes will cease to have charm the moment she\r\nmodernises. In the words of the author of _Idlehurst_, as he looked down\r\non the huddling little settlement from the Cliffe Hill: \"Let us keep a\r\ncountry town or two as preserves for clean atmospheres of body and soul,\r\nfor the almost lost secret of sitting still.... I find myself tangled\r\nin half-dreams of a devolution by which, when national amity shall have\r\nbecome mentionable besides personal pence, London shall attract to\r\nherself all the small vice, as she does already most of the great, from\r\nthe country, all the thrusters after gain, the vulgar, heavy-fingered\r\nintellects, the Progressive spouters, the Bileses, the speculating\r\nbrigandage, and shall give us back from the foggy world of clubs and\r\ncab-ranks and geniuses, the poets and painters, all the nice and witty\r\nand pretty people, to make towns such as this, conserved and purified,\r\ninto country-side Athenses; to form distinct schools of letters and art,\r\nindividual growths, not that universal Cockney mind, smoke-ingrained,\r\nstage-ridden, convention-throttled, which now masquerades under the\r\nforms of every clime and dialect within reach of a tourist ticket.\"\r\n\r\nThe customs of Lewes at the end of the Saxon rule and the beginning of\r\nthe Norman, as recorded in the pages of the Domesday Book, show that\r\nresidence in the town in those days was not unmixed delight, except,\r\nperhaps, for murderers, for whom much seems to have been done. Thus: \"If\r\nthe king wished to send an armament to guard the seas, without his\r\npersonal attendance, twenty shillings were collected from all the\r\ninhabitants, without exception or respect to particular tenure, and\r\nthese were paid to the men-at-arms in the ships.\r\n\r\n\"The seller of a horse, within the borough, pays one penny to the mayor\r\n(sheriff?) and the purchaser another; of an ox, a half-penny; of a man,\r\nfourpence, in whatsoever place he may be brought within the rape.\r\n\r\n\"A murderer forfeits seven shillings and fourpence; a ravisher forfeits\r\neight shillings and fourpence; an adulterer eight shillings and\r\nfourpence; an adultress the same. The king has the adulterer, the bishop\r\nthe adulteress.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PROVIDENT DE WARENNES]\r\n\r\nWith the Conquest new life came into the town, as into South Sussex\r\ngenerally. The rule of the de Braoses, who dominated so much of the\r\ncountry through which we have been passing, is here no more, the great\r\nlord of this district being William de Warenne, who had claims upon\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, not only for services rendered in the Conquest\r\nbut as a son-in-law. When, therefore, the contest was over, some of the\r\nrichest prizes fell to Earl de Warenne. Among them was the township of\r\nLewes, whose situation so pleased the Earl that he decided to make his\r\nhome there. His first action, then, was to graft upon the existing\r\nfortress a new stronghold, the remains of which still stand.\r\n\r\nTen years after the victory at Hastings the memory of the blood of the\r\nsturdy Saxons whom he had hacked down at Battle began so to weigh upon\r\nde Warenne's conscience that he set out with Gundrada upon an expiatory\r\npilgrimage to Rome. Sheltering on the way in the monastery of St. Per,\r\nat Cluny, they were so hospitably received that on returning to Lewes\r\nWilliam and Gundrada built a Priory, partly as a form of gratitude, and\r\npartly as a safeguard for the life to come. In 1078, it was formally\r\nfounded on a magnificent scale. Thus Lewes obtained her castle and her\r\npriory, both now in ruins, in the one of which William de Warenne might\r\nsin with a clear mind, knowing that just below him, on the edge of the\r\nwater-brooks, was (in the other) so tangible an expiation.\r\n\r\nThe date of the formation of the priory spoils the pleasant legend which\r\ntells how Harold, only badly wounded, was carried hither from Battle,\r\nand how, recovering, he lived quietly with the brothers until his\r\nnatural death some years later. A variant of the same story takes the\r\nEnglish king to a cell near St. John's-under-the-Castle, also in Lewes,\r\nand establishes him there as an anchorite. But (although, as we shall\r\nsee when we come to Battle, the facts were otherwise) all true\r\nEnglishmen prefer to think of Harold fighting in the midst of his army,\r\nkilled by a chance arrow shot into the zenith, and lying there until the\r\neyes of Editha of the Swan-neck lighted upon his dear corpse amid the\r\nhundreds of the slain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CASTLE'S CURIOSITIES]\r\n\r\nThe de Warennes held Lewes Castle until the fourteenth century; the\r\nSussex Archæological Society now have it in their fostering care.\r\nArchitecturally it is of no great interest, although it was once unique\r\nin England by the possession of two keeps; nor has it romantic\r\nassociations, like Kenilworth or even Carisbrooke. The crumbling masonry\r\nwas assisted in its decay by no siege or bombardment; the castle has\r\nbeen never the scene of human struggle. Visitors, therefore, must take\r\npleasure chiefly in the curiosities collected in the museum and in the\r\nviews from the roof. A few little rooms hold the treasures amassed by\r\nthe Archæological Society; amassed, it may be said, with little\r\ndifficulty, for the soil of the district is fertile in relics. From\r\nRingmer come rusty shield bosses and the mouldering skull of an\r\nAnglo-Saxon; from the old Lewes gaol come a lock and a key strong enough\r\nto hold Jack Sheppard; and from Horsham Gaol a complete set of fetters\r\nfor ankles and wrists, once used to cramp the movements of female\r\nmalefactors. Here, in a case, is a tiny bronze thimble that tipped the\r\npretty finger of a Roman seamstress--one only among scores of tokens of\r\nthe Roman occupation of the county. Flint arrow heads and celts in\r\nprofusion take us back to remoter times. A Pyecombe crook hangs on one\r\nwall, and relics of the Sussex ironworks are plentiful. The highest room\r\ncontains rubbings of our best brasses. Outside is an early Sussex\r\nplough. In a corner is a beadle's staff that once struck terror into the\r\nhearts of Sabbath-breaking boys; and near one of the windows is a little\r\nbrass crucifix from St. Pancras' Priory. But nothing, the custodian\r\ntells me, so pleases visitors to this very catholic collection as the\r\nmummied hand of a murderess.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE BATTLE OF LEWES]\r\n\r\nLooking down and around from the roof of the keep, you are immediately\r\nstruck by the wide shallow hollow in which Lewes lies. It is something\r\nthe shape of a dairy basin, the gap to the north-west, between Malling\r\nHill and Offham, serving for the lip. Nothing could be flatter than the\r\nsmiling meadows, streaked with tiny streams, stretching between Lewes\r\nand the coast line to the south-east (with the exception of one\r\nsymmetrical hillock just out of the town). Among them curls the lazy\r\nOuse; just beneath you Lewes sleeps, red-roofed as an Italian town,\r\nsending up no hum of activity, listless and immovable save for a few\r\nspirals of silent smoke. The surrounding hills are very fine: Firle\r\nBeacon in the far east; Mount Caburn, a noble cone, in the near east;\r\nMount Harry to the west, on whose slopes Henry III., assisted by the\r\nfiery Prince Edward, fought the Barons. So fiery, indeed, was this lad\r\nthat he forgot all about his father, and gave chase to a small\r\ndetachment of the enemy, catching them up, and hewing them down with the\r\nkeenest enjoyment, while the unhappy Henry was being completely worsted\r\nby de Montfort. It was a bloody battle, made up, as old Fabian wrote, of\r\nembittered men, with hearts full of hatred, \"eyther desyrous to bring\r\nthe other out of lyfe.\" Great fun was made by the humorists of the time,\r\nafter the battle, over the fact that Richard, King of the Romans,\r\nHenry's brother, was captured in a windmill in which he had taken\r\nrefuge. This mill stood near the site of the Black Horse inn. In _The\r\nBarons' Wars_, by Mr. Blaauw, the Sussex antiquary, the whole story is\r\ntold.\r\n\r\nLewes has played but a small part in history since that battle; but, as\r\nwe saw when we were at Rottingdean, it was one of her Cluniac priors\r\nthat repulsed the French in 1377, and her son, Sir Nicholas Pelham, who\r\nperformed a similar service in 1545, at Seaford. As the verses on his\r\nmonument in St. Michael's Church run:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     What time the French sought to have sackt Sea-Foord,\r\n     This Pelham did repel-em back aboord.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ann of Cleves' House, Southover._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CLUNIAC PRIORY]\r\n\r\nThe Cluniac priory of St. Pancras was dissolved by Henry VIII. in 1537,\r\nThomas Cromwell, that execrable vandal, not only abolishing the monks\r\nbut destroying the buildings, which covered, with their gardens and fish\r\nponds, forty acres. The ruins that remain give some idea of the extent\r\nof this wonderful priory, another relic being the adjacent mound on\r\nwhich the Calvary stood, probably constructed of the earth removed for\r\nthe purpose from the Dripping Pan, as the hollow circular space is\r\ncalled where Lewes now plays cricket. One very pretty possession of the\r\nmonks was allowed to stand until quite recent times--the Columbarium,\r\nwhich was as large as a church and contained homes for 3,228 birds. It\r\nhas now vanished; but an idea of what it was may be gained from the\r\npigeon house at Alciston, a few miles distant, which belonged to Battle\r\nAbbey.\r\n\r\nThe priory's possessions were granted to Cromwell by Henry VIII., who,\r\ntradition asserts (somewhat directly in the face of historical\r\nevidence), murdered one of his wives on a winding stair in the building,\r\nand may therefore have been glad to see its demolition. Which wife it\r\nwas, is not stated, but when Cromwell went the way of all this king's\r\nfavourites, the property was transferred to Ann of Cleves, who is\r\nsupposed to have lived in the most picturesque of the old houses on the\r\nright hand side of Southover's street as you leave Lewes for the Ouse\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nSouthover church, in itself a beautiful structure of the grave red type,\r\nwith a square ivied tower and the most delicate vane in Sussex, is\r\nrendered the more interesting by the possession of the leaden caskets of\r\nWilliam de Warenne and Gundrada and the superb tomb removed from Isfield\r\nchurch and very ingeniously restored. These relics repose in a charming\r\nlittle chapel built in their honour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TOM PAINE]\r\n\r\nA notable man who had association with Lewes was Tom Paine, author of\r\n_The Rights of Man_. He settled there as an exciseman in 1768, married\r\nElizabeth Ollive of the same town at St. Michael's Church in 1771, and\r\nsucceeded to her father's business as a tobacconist and grocer. Paine\r\nwas more successful as a debater than a business man. As a member of the\r\nWhite Hart evening club he was more often than any other the winner of\r\nthe Headstrong Book--an old Greek Homer despatched the next morning to\r\nthe most obstinate haranguer of the preceding night. It was at Lewes\r\nthat Tom Paine's thoughts were first turned to the question of\r\ngovernment. He used thus to tell the story. One evening after playing\r\nbowls, all the party retired to drink punch; when, in the conversation\r\nthat ensued, Mr. Verril (it should be Verrall) \"observed, alluding to\r\nthe wars of Frederick, that the King of Prussia was the best fellow in\r\nthe world for a king, he had so much of the devil in him. This, striking\r\nme with great force, occasioned the reflection, that if it were\r\nnecessary for a king to have so much of the devil in him, kings might\r\nvery beneficially be dispensed with.\"\r\n\r\nI thought of that historic game of bowls as I watched four Lewes\r\ngentlemen playing this otherwise discreetest of games in the meadow by\r\nthe castle gate on a fine September evening. Surely (after the historic\r\nPlymouth Hoe) a lawn in the shadow of a Norman castle is the ideal spot\r\nfor this leisurely but exciting pastime. The four Lewes gentlemen played\r\nuncommonly well, with bowls of peculiar splendour in which a setting of\r\nsilver glistened as they sped over the turf. After each game one little\r\nboy bearing a cloth wiped the bowls while another registered the score.\r\nAnd now I feel that no one can really be said to have seen Lewes unless\r\nhe has watched the progress of such a game: it remains in my mind as\r\nintimate a part of the town and the town's spirit as the ruins of the\r\nPriory, or Keere Street, or the Castle itself.\r\n\r\nThe house of Tom Paine, just off the High Street, almost opposite the\r\ncircular tower of St. Michael's, has a tablet commemorating its\r\nillustrious owner. It also has a very curious red carved demon which\r\notherwise distinguishes it. Lewes was not always proud of Tom Paine; but\r\nCuckfield went farther. In 1793, I learn from the _Sussex Advertiser_\r\nfor that year, Cuckfield emphasised its loyalty to the constitution by\r\nsinging \"God save the King\" in the streets and burning Paine in effigy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"CLIO\" RICKMAN]\r\n\r\nMention of Tom Paine naturally calls to mind his friend and biographer\r\n(and my thrice great uncle), Thomas \"Clio\" Rickman, the Citizen of the\r\nWorld, who was born at Lewes in 1760. Rickman began life as a Quaker,\r\nand therefore without his pagan middle name, which he first adopted as\r\nthe signature to epigrams and scraps of verse in the local paper, and\r\nafterwards incorporated in his signature. Rickman's connection with Tom\r\nPaine and his own revolutionary habits were a source of distress to his\r\nQuaker relatives at Lewes, so much so that there is a story in the\r\nfamily of the Citizen being refused admission to a house in the\r\nneighbourhood where he had eight impressionable nieces, and, when he\r\nwould visit their father, being entertained instead at the Bear. His\r\nBible, with sceptical marginal notes, is still preserved, with the bad\r\npages pasted together by a subsequent owner.\r\n\r\nAfter roving about in Spain and other countries he settled as a\r\nbookseller in London, and it was in his house and at his table that _The\r\nRights of Man_ was written. \"This table,\" says an article on Rickman in\r\nthe _Wonderful Museum_, \"is prized by him very highly at this time; and\r\nno doubt will be deemed a rich relic by some of our irreligious\r\nconnoisseurs.\" It was shown at the Tom Paine exhibition a few years ago.\r\nRickman escaped prosecution, but he once had his papers seized.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TIPPER'S EPITAPH]\r\n\r\nAccording to his portrait Clio wore a hat like a beehive, and he\r\ninvented a trumpet to increase the sound of a signal gun. His verse is\r\nexceedingly poor, his finest poetical achievement being the epitaph on\r\nThomas Tipper in Newhaven churchyard. Tipper was the brewer of the ale\r\nthat was known as \"Newhaven Tipper\"; but he was other things too:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Honest he was, ingenuous, blunt and kind,\r\n     And dared what few dare do, to speak his mind.\r\n     Philosophy and history well he knew,\r\n     Was versed in Physic and in surgery too,\r\n     The best old Stingo he both brewed and sold,\r\n     Nor did one knavish act to get his gold.\r\n     He played through life a varied comic part,\r\n     And knew immortal Hudibras by heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Lamb greatly admired the end of this epitaph. Clio Rickman died\r\nin 1834.\r\n\r\nAmong other men of note who have lived in Lewes or have had association\r\nwith it, was John Evelyn the diarist, who had some of his education at\r\nSouthover grammar school: Mark Antony Lower, the Sussex antiquary, to\r\nwhom all writers on the county are indebted; the Rev. T. W. Horsfield,\r\nthe historian of Sussex, without whose work we should also often be in\r\ndifficulties; and the Rev. Gideon Mantell, the Sussex geologist, whose\r\ncollection of Sussex fossils is preserved in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nIn St. Ann's church on the hill lie the bones of a remarkable man who\r\ndied at Lewes (in the tenth climacteric) in 1613--no less a person than\r\nThomas Twyne, M.D. In addition to the principles of physic he\r\n\"comprehended earthquakes\" and wrote a book about them. He also wrote a\r\nsurvey of the world. I quote Horsfield's translation of the florid Latin\r\ninscription to his memory: \"Hippocrates saw Twyne lifeless and his bones\r\nslightly covered with earth. Some of his sacred dust (says he) will be\r\nof use to me in removing diseases; for the dead, when converted into\r\nmedicine, will expel human maladies, and ashes prevail against ashes.\r\nNow the physician is absent, disease extends itself on every side, and\r\nexults its enemy is no more. Alas! here lies our preserver Twyne; the\r\nflower and ornament of his age. Sussex deprived of her physician,\r\nlanguished, and is ready to sink along with him. Believe me, no future\r\nage will produce so good a physician and so renowned a man as this has.\r\nHe died at Lewes in 1613, on the 1st of August, in the tenth\r\nclimacteric, (viz. 70).\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DR. JOHNSON AT LEWES]\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson was once in Lewes, on a day's visit to the Shelleys, at the\r\nhouse which bears their name at the south end of the town. One of the\r\nlittle girls becoming rather a nuisance with her questions, the Doctor\r\nlifted her into a cherry tree and walked off. At dinner, some time\r\nlater, the child was missed, and a search party was about to set out\r\nwhen the Doctor exclaimed, \"Oh, I left her in a tree!\" For many years\r\nthe tree was known as \"Dr. Johnson's cherry tree.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _St. Ann's Church, Southover._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FIFTH]\r\n\r\nLewes is ordinarily still and leisurely, with no bustle in her steep\r\nstreets save on market days: an abode of rest and unhastening feet. But\r\non one night of the year she lays aside her grey mantle and her quiet\r\ntones and emerges a Bacchante robed in flame. Lewes on the 5th of\r\nNovember is an incredible sight; probably no other town in the United\r\nKingdom offers such a contrast to its ordinary life. I have never heard\r\nthat Lewes is notably Protestant on other days in the year, that any\r\nintolerance is meted out to Roman Catholics on November 4th or November\r\n6th; but on November 5th she appears to believe that the honour of the\r\nreformed church is wholly in her hands, and that unless her voice is\r\nheard declaiming against the tyrannies and treacheries of Rome all the\r\nspiritual labours of the eighth Henry will have been in vain.\r\n\r\nNo fewer than eight Bonfire Societies flourish in the town, all in a\r\nstrong financial position. Each of these has its bonfire blazing or\r\nsmouldering at a street corner, from dusk to midnight, and each, at a\r\ncertain stage in the evening, forms into procession, and approaching its\r\nown fire by devious routes, burns an effigy of the Pope, together with\r\nwhatever miscreant most fills the public eye at the moment--such as\r\nGeneral Booth or Mr. Kruger, both of whom I have seen incinerated amid\r\ncheers and detonations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEWES ROUSERS]\r\n\r\nThe figures are not lightly cast upon the flames, but are conducted\r\nthither ceremoniously, the \"Bishop\" of the society having first passed\r\nsentence upon them in a speech bristling with local allusions. These\r\nspeeches serve the function of a _revue_ of the year and are sometimes\r\nquite clever, but it is not until they are printed in the next morning's\r\npaper that one can take their many points. The principal among the many\r\ndistractions is the \"rouser,\" a squib peculiar to Lewes, to which the\r\nbonfire boys (who are, by the way, in great part boys only in name, like\r\nthe postboys of the past and the cowboys of the present) have given\r\nlaborious nights throughout the preceding October. The rouser is much\r\nlarger and heavier than the ordinary squib; it is propelled through the\r\nair like a rocket by the force of its escaping sparks; and it bursts\r\nwith a terrible report. In order to protect themselves from the ravages\r\nof the rouser the people in the streets wear spectacles of wire netting,\r\nwhile the householders board up their windows and lay damp straw on\r\ntheir gratings. Ordinary squibs and crackers are also continuously\r\nignited, while now and then one of the sky rockets discharged in flights\r\nfrom a procession, elects to take a horizontal course, and hurtles\r\nhead-high down the crowded street.\r\n\r\nSo the carnival proceeds until midnight, when the firemen, who have\r\nbeen on the alert all the evening, extinguish the fires. The Bonfire\r\nSocieties subsequently collect information as to any damage done and\r\nmake it good: a wise course, to which they owe in part the sanction to\r\nrenew the orgie next year. Other towns in Sussex keep up the glorious\r\nFifth with some spirit, but nowhere in England is there anything to\r\ncompare with the thoroughness of Lewes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Ouse at South Street, Lewes._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LEWES MARTYRS]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RICHARD WOODMAN]\r\n\r\nTo some extent Lewes may consider that she has reason for the display,\r\nfor on June 22, 1557, ten men and women were tied to the stake and\r\nburned to death in the High Street for professing a faith obnoxious to\r\nQueen Mary. Chief of these courageous enthusiasts were Richard Woodman\r\nand Derrick Carver. Woodman, a native of Buxted, had settled at\r\nWarbleton, where he was a prosperous iron master. All went well until\r\nMary's accession to the throne, when the rector of Warbleton, who had\r\nbeen a Protestant under Edward VI., turned, in Foxe's words, \"head to\r\ntayle\" and preached \"clean contrary to that which he had before taught.\"\r\nWoodman's protests carried him to imprisonment and the stake.\r\nAltogether, Lewes saw the death of sixteen martyrs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Ouse at Piddinghoe._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE OUSE VALLEY\r\n\r\n     The two Ouses--Three round towers--Thirsty\r\n     labourers--Telscombe--The hills and the sea--Mrs. Marriott Watson's\r\n     Down poem--Newhaven--A Sussex miller--Seaford's past--A politic\r\n     smuggler--Electioneering ingenuity--Bishopstone.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe road from Lewes to the sea runs along the edge of the Ouse levels,\r\njust under the bare hills, passing through villages that are little more\r\nthan homesteads of the sheep-farmers, albeit each has its church--Iford,\r\nRodmell, Southease, Piddinghoe--and so to Newhaven, the county's only\r\nharbour of any importance since the sea silted up the Shoreham bar. You\r\nmay be as much out of the world in one of these minute villages as\r\nanywhere twice the distance from London; and the Downs above them are\r\npractically virgin soil. The Brighton horseman or walker takes as a rule\r\na line either to Lewes or to Newhaven, rarely adventuring in the\r\ndirection of Iford Hill, Highdole Hill, or Telscombe village, which\r\nnestles three hundred feet high, over Piddinghoe. By day the waggons ply\r\nsteadily between Lewes and the port, but other travellers are few. Once\r\nevening falls the world is your own, with nothing but the bleat of sheep\r\nand the roar of the French boat trains to recall life and civilisation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE OUSE VALLEY]\r\n\r\nThe air of this valley is singularly clear, producing on fine days a\r\nblue effect that is, I believe, peculiar to the district. In the\r\nsketches of a Brighton painter in water colours, Mr. Clem Lambert, who\r\nhas worked much at Rodmell, the spirit of the river valleys of Sussex is\r\nreproduced with extraordinary fidelity and the minimum loss of\r\nfreshness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Rodmell._]\r\n\r\nHorsfield, rather than have no poetical blossom to deck his page at the\r\nmention of the Lewes river, quotes a passage from \"The Task\":\r\n\r\n\r\n     Here Ouse, slow winding through a level plain\r\n     Of spacious meads, with cattle sprinkled o'er,\r\n     Conducts the eye along his sinuous course\r\n     Delighted.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson's remark that one green field is like another green field,\r\nmight, one sees, be extended to rivers, for Cowper was, of course,\r\ndescribing the Ouse at Olney.\r\n\r\nThe first village out of Lewes on the Newhaven road is Kingston (one of\r\nthree Sussex villages of this name), on the side of the hill, once the\r\nproperty of Sir Philip Sidney. Next is Iford, with straw blowing free\r\nand cows in its meadows; next Rodmell, whence Whiteway Bottom and Breaky\r\nBottom lead to the highlands above: next Southease, where the only\r\nbridge over the Ouse between Lewes and Newhaven is to be crossed: a\r\nlittle village famous for a round church tower, of which Sussex knows\r\nbut three, one other at St. Michael's, Lewes, and one at Piddinghoe, the\r\nnext village.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SOUTHEASE THIRST]\r\n\r\nThe Southease rustics were once of independent mind, as may be gathered\r\nfrom the following extract from the \"Manorial Customs of\r\nSouthease-with-Heighton, near Lewes,\" in 1623: \"Every reaper must have\r\nallowed him, at the cost of the lord or his farmer, one drinkinge in the\r\nmorninge of bread and cheese, and a dinner at noone consistinge of\r\nrostmeate and other good victualls, meete for men and women in harvest\r\ntime; and two drinkinges in the afternoone, one in the middest of their\r\nafternoone's work and the other at the ende of their day's work, and\r\ndrinke alwayes duringe their work as neede shall require.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PIDD'NHOO]\r\n\r\nTelscombe, the capital of these lonely Downs and as good an objective as\r\nthe walker who sets out from Brighton, Rottingdean, or Lewes to climb\r\nhills can ask, is a charming little shy hamlet which nothing can harm,\r\nsnugly reposing in its combe, above Piddinghoe. Piddinghoe (pronounced\r\nPidd'nhoo) is a compact village at the foot of the hill; but it has\r\nsuffered in picturesqueness and character by its proximity to the\r\ncommercial enterprise of Newhaven. Hussey, in his _Notes on the Churches\r\nof ... Sussex_, suggests that a field north of the village was once the\r\nsite of a considerable Roman villa. A local sarcasm credits Piddinghoe\r\npeople with the habit of shoeing their magpies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Piddinghoe._]\r\n\r\nThe Downs when we saw them first, between Midhurst and Chichester,\r\nformed an inland chain parallel with the shore: here, and eastward as\r\nfar as Beachy Head, where they suddenly cease, their southern slopes are\r\nwashed by the Channel. This companionship of the sea lends them an\r\nadditional wildness: sea mists now and then envelop them in a cloud; sea\r\nbirds rise and fall above their cliffs; the roar or sigh of the waves\r\nmingles with the cries of sheep; the salt savour of the sea is borne on\r\nthe wind over the crisp turf. It was, I fancy, among the Downs in this\r\npart of Sussex that Mrs. Marriott-Watson wrote the intimately\r\nunderstanding lines which I take the liberty of quoting:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A HILL POEM]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ON THE DOWNS.\r\n\r\n     Broad and bare to the skies\r\n     The great Down-country lies,\r\n     Green in the glance of the sun,\r\n     Fresh with the clean salt air;\r\n     Screaming the gulls rise from the fresh-turned mould,\r\n     Where the round bosom of the wind-swept wold\r\n     Slopes to the valley fair.\r\n\r\n     Where the pale stubble shines with golden gleam\r\n     The silver ploughshare cleaves its hard-won way\r\n     Behind the patient team,\r\n     The slow black oxen toiling through the day\r\n     Tireless, impassive still,\r\n     From dawning dusk and chill\r\n     To twilight grey.\r\n\r\n     Far off the pearly sheep\r\n     Along the upland steep\r\n     Follow their shepherd from the wattled fold,\r\n     With tinkling bell-notes falling sweet and cold\r\n     As a stream's cadence, while a skylark sings\r\n     High in the blue, with eager outstretched wings,\r\n     Till the strong passion of his joy be told.\r\n\r\n     But when the day grows old,\r\n     And night cometh fold on fold,\r\n     Dulling the western gold,\r\n     Blackening bush and tree,\r\n     Veiling the ranks of cloud,\r\n     In their pallid pomp and proud\r\n     That hasten home from the sea,\r\n     Listen--now and again if the night be still enow,\r\n     You may hear the distant sea range to and fro\r\n     Tearing the shingly bourne of his bounden track,\r\n     Moaning with hate as he fails and falleth back;\r\n\r\n     The Downs are peopled then;\r\n     Fugitive, low-browed men\r\n     Start from the slopes around\r\n     Over the murky ground\r\n     Crouching they run with rough-wrought bow and spear,\r\n     Now seen, now hid, they rise and disappear,\r\n     Lost in the gloom again.\r\n\r\n     Soft on the dew-fall damp\r\n     Scarce sounds the measured tramp\r\n     Of bronze-mailed sentinels,\r\n     Dark on the darkened fells\r\n     Guarding the camp.\r\n\r\n     The Roman watch-fires glow\r\n     Red on the dusk; and harsh\r\n     Cries a heron flitting slow\r\n     Over the valley marsh\r\n     Where the sea-mist gathers low.\r\n\r\n     Closer, and closer yet\r\n     Draweth the night's dim net\r\n     Hiding the troubled dead:\r\n     No more to see or know\r\n     But a black waste lying below,\r\n     And a glimmering blank o'erhead.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Newhaven there is little to say, except that in rough weather the\r\ntraveller from France is very glad to reach it, and on a fine day the\r\ntraveller from England is happy to leave it behind. In the churchyard is\r\na monument in memory of the officers and crew of the _Brazen_, which\r\nwent down off the town in 1800, and lost all hands save one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A SUSSEX MILLER]\r\n\r\nOn the way to Seaford, which is nearly three miles east, sheltering\r\nunder its white headland (a preliminary sketch, as one might say, for\r\nBeachy Head), we pass the Bishopstone tide mills, once the property of a\r\nsturdy and prosperous Sussex autocrat named William Catt, the grower of\r\nthe best pears in the county, and the first to welcome Louis Philippe\r\n(whom he had advised on milling in France) when he landed at Newhaven in\r\nexile. A good story told of William Catt, by Mr. Lower, in his _Worthies\r\nof Sussex_, illustrates not only the character of that sagacious and\r\nkindly martinet, but also of the Sussex peasant in its mingled\r\nindependence and dependence, frankness and caution. Mr. Catt, having\r\nunbent among his retainers at a harvest supper, one of them, a little\r\nemboldened perhaps by draughts of Newhaven \"tipper,\" thus addressed his\r\nmaster. \"Give us yer hand, sir, I love ye, I love ye,\" but, he added,\r\n\"I'm danged if I beant afeared of ye, though.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Southover Grange._]\r\n\r\nThere was a hermitage on the cliff at Seaford some centuries ago. In\r\n1372 the hermit's name was Peter, and we find him receiving letters of\r\nprotection for the unusual term of five years. In the vestry of the\r\nchurch is an old monument bearing the riddling inscription: \"... Also,\r\nnear this place lie two mothers, three grandmothers, four aunts, four\r\nsisters, four daughters, four grand-daughters, three cousins--but VI\r\npersons.\" A record in the Seaford archives runs thus: \"Dec. 24, 1652.\r\nThen were all accounts taken and all made even, from the beginning of\r\nye world, of the former Bayliffes unto the present time, and there\r\nremained ... ye sum of twelve pounds, sixteen shillings, seven pence.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PRICE OF TWO VOTES]\r\n\r\nMillburgh House, Seaford, was of old called Corsica Hall, having been\r\nbuilt (originally at Wellingham, near Lewes, and then moved) by a\r\nsmuggler named Whitfield, who was outlawed for illicit traffic in\r\nCorsican wine. He obtained the removal of his outlawry by presenting\r\nGeorge II. with a selection of his choicest vintages. Another agreeable\r\nstory of local corruption is told concerning Seaford's old\r\nelectioneering days. It was in 1798, during the candidature of Sir\r\nGodfrey Webster of Battle Abbey. Sir Godfrey was one day addressed by\r\nMrs. S---- (nothing but Horsfield's delicacy keeps her name from fame) in\r\nthe following terms: \"Mr. S----, sir, will vote, of course, as he\r\npleases--I have nothing to do or to say about him; but there is my\r\ngardener and my coachman, both of whom will, I am sure, be entirely\r\nguided by me. Now, they are both family men, Sir Godfrey, and I wish to\r\ndo the best I can to serve them. Now, I know you are in great doubt, and\r\nthat two sure votes are of great value: I'll tell you what you shall do.\r\nYou shall give me _£_200; nobody will know any thing about it; there will\r\nbe no danger--no bribery, Sir Godfrey, at all. I will desire the men to\r\ngo and vote for you and Colonel Tarleton, and it will all be right, and\r\nno harm done. The bargain,\" adds Horsfield, \"was struck--the money\r\npaid--the votes given as promised; and the election over, the old lady\r\ngave the two men _£_30 a piece, and pocketed the rest for the good of her\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SEAFORD TO LEWES]\r\n\r\nSeaford's neighbouring village, Bishopstone, in addition to its tide\r\nmills--the only tide mills in Sussex excepting that at Sidlesham, now\r\ndisused--possessed once the oldest windmill in the county. In the very\r\ncharming little church is buried James Hurdis, author of _The Village\r\nCurate_, whom we shall meet again at Burwash. From Bishopstone we may\r\nreturn to Lewes either by the road through South Heighton, Tarring\r\nNeville, Itford Farm, and Beddingham, or cross the river again at\r\nSouthease, and retrace our earlier steps through Rodmell and Iford. That\r\nis the quicker way. The road through Beddingham is longer, and\r\ninteresting rather for the hills above it than for anything upon it. To\r\nthese hills we come in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Near Tarring Neville._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nALFRISTON\r\n\r\n     Three routes to Alfriston--West Firle--The Gages--A \"Noble\r\n     Dame\"--Sussex pronunciation and doggedness--The Selmeston\r\n     smugglers--Alfriston's ancient inn--The middle ages and P....\r\n     P....--Alfriston church--A miracle and a sign--An Alfriston\r\n     scholar--Dr. Benbrigg--The smallest church in Sussex--Alfriston as\r\n     a centre--A digression on walking--\"A Song against\r\n     Speed\"--Alciston--A Berwick genius--The Long Man of Wilmington.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfriston may be reached from Lewes by rail, taking train to Berwick; by\r\nroad, under the hills; or on foot or horse-back, over the hills. By\r\nroad, you pass first through Beddingham, a small village, where, it is\r\nsaid, was once a monastery; then, by a southern _détour_, to West Firle,\r\na charming little village with a great park, which bears the same\r\nrelation to Firle Beacon that Wiston Park does to Chanctonbury Ring. The\r\ntower in the east serves to provide a good view of the Weald for those\r\nwho do not care to climb the beacon's seven hundred feet and get a\r\nbetter. The little church is rich in interesting memorials of the Gages,\r\nwho have been the lords of Firle for many a long year.\r\n\r\nIn the house is a portrait of Sir John Gage, the trusted friend of Henry\r\nVIII., Edward VI., and Mary, and, as Constable of the Tower, the gaoler\r\n(but a very kind one) of both Lady Jane Grey and the Princess Elizabeth,\r\nafterwards Good Queen Bess. In Harrison Ainsworth's romance _The\r\nConstable of the Tower_ Sir John Gage is much seen. Sir John was\r\nsucceeded at Firle by his son Sir Edward, who, as High Sheriff of\r\nSussex, was one of the judges of the Sussex martyrs, but who, even Foxe\r\nadmits, exercised courtesy to them. Sir Edward's son, Sir John Gage, was\r\nthe second husband of the Lady Penelope D'Arcy, Mr. Hardy's heroine,\r\nwhose portrait we saw at Parham: who, being courted as a girl by Sir\r\nGeorge Trenchard, Sir John Gage, and Sir William Hervey, promised she\r\nwould marry all in turn, and did so. Sir George left her a widow at\r\nseventeen; to Sir John Gage she bore nine children.\r\n\r\nReturning from Firle to the high road, we come next, by following for a\r\nlittle a left turn, to Selmeston, the village where Mr. W. D. Parish,\r\nthe rector for very many years, collected most of the entertaining\r\nexamples of the Sussex dialect with which I have made so free in a later\r\nchapter. The church is very simple and well-cared for, with some pretty\r\nsouth windows. The small memorial tablets of brass which have been let\r\ninto the floor symmetrically among the tiles seem to me a happier means\r\nof commemoration than mural tablets,--at least for a modest building\r\nsuch as this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VAGARIES OF PRONUNCIATION]\r\n\r\nIn losing your way in this neighbourhood do not ask the passer-by for\r\nSelmeston, but for Simson; for Selmeston, pronounced as spelt, does not\r\nexist. Sussex men are curiously intolerant of the phonetics of\r\northography. Brighthelmstone was called Brighton from the first,\r\nalthough only in the last century was the spelling modified to agree\r\nwith the sound. Chalvington (the name of a village north of Selmeston)\r\nis a pretty word, but Sussex declines to call it other than Chawton.\r\nFirle becomes Furrel; Lewes is almost Lose, but not quite; Heathfield is\r\nHefful. It is characteristic of a Sussex man that he always knows best;\r\nthough all the masters of all the colleges should assemble about him and\r\nspeak reasoningly of Selmeston he would leave the congress as\r\nincorrigible and self-satisfied a Simsonian as ever.\r\n\r\nMany years ago Selmeston churchyard possessed an empty tomb, in which\r\nthe smugglers were wont to store their goods until a favourable time\r\ncame to set them on the road. Any objections that those in authority\r\nmight have had were silenced by an occasional tub. But of this more in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALFRISTON]\r\n\r\nAnd so we come to Alfriston; but, as I said, the right way was over the\r\nhills, ascending them either at Itford (crossing the Ouse at Southease)\r\nor by that remarkable combe, one of the finest in Sussex, with an avenue\r\nleading to it, which is gained from a lane south of Beddingham. Firle\r\nBeacon's lofty summit is half-way between Beddingham and Alfriston, and\r\nfrom this height, with its magnificent view of the Weald, we descend\r\nsteadily to the Cuckmere valley, of which Alfriston is the capital.\r\n\r\nAlfriston, which is now only a village street, shares with Chichester\r\nthe distinction of possessing a market cross. Alfriston's specimen is,\r\nhowever, sadly mutilated, a mere relic, whereas Chichester's is being\r\nmade more splendid as I write. Alfriston also has one of the oldest inns\r\nin the county--the \"Star\"--(finer far in its way than any of\r\nChichester's seventy and more); but Ainsworth was wrong in sending\r\nCharles II. thither, in _Ovingdean Grange_. It is one of the inns that\r\nthe Merry Monarch never saw. The \"Star\" was once a sanctuary, within the\r\njurisdiction of the Abbot of Battle, for persons flying from justice;\r\nand it is pleasant to sit in the large room upstairs, over the street,\r\nand think of fugitives pattering up the valley, with fearful backward\r\nglances, and hammering at the old door. One Birrel, in the reign of\r\nHenry VIII., having stolen a horse at Lydd, in Kent, took refuge here.\r\nThe inn in those days was intended chiefly for the refreshment of\r\nmendicant friars.\r\n\r\nIn 1767 the landlord was, according to a private letter, \"as great a\r\ncuriosity as the house.\" I wish we had some information about him, for\r\nthe house is quaint and curious indeed, with its red lion sentinel at\r\nthe side (figure-head from a Dutch wreck in Cuckmere Haven), and its\r\ncarvings inside and out. The old and the new mingled very oddly when I\r\nwas lately at Alfriston. Hearing a familiar sound, as of a battledore\r\nand a ball, in one of the rooms, I opened the door and discovered the\r\nlandlord and a groom from the racing stables near by in the throes of\r\nthe most modern of games, amid surroundings absolutely mediæval.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CATHEDRAL OF THE DOWNS]\r\n\r\nThe size of the grave and commanding church, which has been called the\r\ncathedral of the South Downs, alone proves that Alfriston was once a\r\nvastly more important place than it now is. Legend says that the\r\nfoundations were first cut in the meadow known as Savyne Croft. There\r\nday after day the builders laid their stones, arriving each morning to\r\nfind them removed to the Tye, the field where the church now stands. At\r\nlast the meaning of the miracle entered their heads, and the church was\r\nerected on the new site. Its shape was determined by the slumbers of\r\nfour oxen, who were observed by the architect to be sleeping in the form\r\nof a cross. Poynings church, under the Dyke Hill, near Brighton, was\r\nbuilt, it has been conjectured, by the same architect. Within the\r\ncathedral of the South Downs, which is a fourteenth century building, is\r\na superb east window, but it has no coloured glass. The register,\r\nbeginning with 1504, is perhaps the oldest in England. Hard by the\r\nchurch is the simple little clergy house--unique in England, I\r\nbelieve--dating from pre-Reformation times. It has lately been very\r\ncarefully restored.\r\n\r\nAlfriston once had a scholar in the person of Thomas Chowne, of Frog\r\nFirle, the old house on the road to Seaford, about a mile beyond the\r\nvillage. Chowne, who died in 1639, and was buried at Alfriston, is thus\r\ntouched off by Fuller:--\"Thomas Chune, Esquire, living at Alfriston in\r\nthis County, set forth a small Manuall, intituled _Collectiones\r\nTheologicarum Conclusionum_. Indeed, many have much opposed it (as what\r\nbook meeteth not with opposition?); though such as dislike must commend\r\nthe brevity and clearness of his Positions. For mine own part, I am glad\r\nto see a Lay-Gentleman so able and industrious.\" Chowne's great great\r\ngrandson, an antiquary, one night left some books too near his library\r\nfire; they ignited, and Frog Firle Place was in large part destroyed. It\r\nis now only a fragment of what it was, and is known as Burnt House.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN ALFRISTON DOCTOR]\r\n\r\nAn intermediate dweller at Frog Firle was one Robert Andrews, who, when\r\nunwell, seems to have been attended by William Benbrigg. Miss Florence\r\nA. Pagden, in her agreeable little history of Alfriston, from which I\r\nhave been glad to borrow, prints two of Mr. Benbrigg's letters of kindly\r\nbut vague advice to his patient. Here is one:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"MR. ANDREWS,\r\n\r\n     \"I have sent you some things which you may take in the manner\r\n     following, viz.:--of that in the bottle marked with a + you may\r\n     take of the quantity of a spoonfull or so, now and then, and at\r\n     night take some of those pills, drinking a little warm beer after\r\n     it, and in the morning take 2 spoonfulls of that in ------\r\n     bottle fasting an hour after it, and then you may eat something,\r\n     you may take also of the first, and every night a pill, and in the\r\n     morning. I hope this will do you good, which is the desire of him\r\n     who is your loving friend,\r\n\r\n                                                      \"WM. BENBRIGG.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfriston once had a race meeting of its own--the course is still to be\r\nseen on the southern slope of Firle Beacon--and it also fostered cricket\r\nin the early days. A famous single-wicket match was contested here in\r\n1787, between four men whose united ages amounted to 297 years. History\r\nrecords that the game was played with \"great spirit and activity.\" Mr.\r\nLower records, in 1870, that the largest pear and the largest apple ever\r\nknown in England were both grown at Alfriston, but possibly the record\r\nhas since been broken.\r\n\r\nThe smallest church in Sussex is however still to Alfriston's credit,\r\nfor Lullington church, on the hill side, just across the river and the\r\nfields to the east of Alfriston church, may be considered to belong to\r\nAlfriston without any violence to its independence. As a matter of fact,\r\nthe church was once bigger, the chancel alone now standing. What\r\nCharles Lamb says of Hollington church in Chapter XXXVI. of this book,\r\nwould be more fitting of Lullington.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HILL WALKS]\r\n\r\nWe have come to Alfriston from Lewes, proposing to return there; but it\r\nmight well be made a centre, so much fine hill country does it command.\r\nAlfriston to Seaford direct, over the hills and back of the cliffs and\r\nthe Cuckmere valley; Alfriston to Eastbourne, crossing the Cuckmere at\r\nLitlington, and beginning the ascent of the hills at West Dean;\r\nAlfriston to Lewes over Firle Beacon; Alfriston to Newhaven direct;\r\nAlfriston to Jevington and Willingdon;--all these routes cover good Down\r\ncountry, making the best of primitive rambles by day and bringing one at\r\nevening back to the \"Star,\" this mediæval inn in the best of primitive\r\nvillages. Few persons, however, are left who will climb hills--even\r\ngrass hills--if they can help it; hence this counsel is likely to lead\r\nto no overcrowding of Fore Down, The Camp, Five Lords Burgh, South Hill,\r\nor Firle Beacon.\r\n\r\nI might here, perhaps, be allowed to insert some verses upon the new\r\nlocomotion, since they bear upon this question of walking in remote\r\nplaces, and were composed to some extent in Sussex byways in the spring\r\nof 1903:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A SONG AGAINST SPEED]\r\n\r\n\r\n             A SONG AGAINST SPEED.\r\n\r\n     Of speed the savour and the sting,\r\n         None but the weak deride;\r\n     But ah, the joy of lingering\r\n         About the country side!\r\n     The swiftest wheel, the conquering run,\r\n         We count no privilege\r\n     Beside acquiring, in the sun,\r\n         The secret of the hedge.\r\n\r\n     Where is the poet fired to sing\r\n         The snail's discreet degrees,\r\n     A rhapsody of sauntering,\r\n         A gloria of ease;\r\n     Proclaiming their's the baser part\r\n         Who consciously forswear\r\n     The delicate and gentle art\r\n         Of never getting there?\r\n\r\n     _To get there first!_--'tis time to ring\r\n         The knell of such an aim;\r\n     _To be the swiftest!_--riches bring\r\n         So easily that fame.\r\n     _To shine, a highway meteor,\r\n         Devourer of the map!_--\r\n     A vulgar bliss to choose before\r\n         Repose in Nature's lap!\r\n\r\n     Consider too how small a thing\r\n         The highest speed you gain:\r\n     A bee can frolic on the wing\r\n         Around the fastest train.\r\n     Think of the swallow in the air,\r\n         The salmon in the stream,\r\n     And cease to boast the records rare\r\n         Of paraffin and steam.\r\n\r\n     Most, most of all when comes the Spring,\r\n         Again to lay (as now)\r\n     Her hand benign and quickening\r\n         On meadow, hill and bough,\r\n     Should speed's enchantment lose its power,\r\n         For \"None who would exceed\r\n     [The Mother speaks] a mile an hour,\r\n         My heart aright can read.\"\r\n\r\n     The turnpike from the car to fling,\r\n         As from a yacht the sea,\r\n     Is doubtless as inspiriting\r\n         As aught on land can be;\r\n     I grant the glory, the romance,\r\n         But look behind the veil--\r\n     Suppose that while the motor pants\r\n         You miss the nightingale!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALCISTON]\r\n\r\nTo return to Alfriston, there are two brief excursions (possible in the\r\nvehicles that are glanced at in the foregoing verses) which ought to be\r\ndescribed here: to Alciston and to Wilmington. Alciston is a little\r\nhamlet under the east slope of Firle Beacon, practically no more than a\r\nfarm house, a church, and dependant cottages. It is on a road that leads\r\nonly to itself and \"to the Hill\" (as the sign-boards say hereabout); it\r\nis perhaps as nearly forgotten as any village in the county; and yet I\r\nknow of no village with more unobtrusive charm. The church, which has no\r\nvicar of its own, being served from Selmeston, a mile away, stands high\r\namid its graves, the whole churchyard having been heaped up and\r\nramparted much as a castle is. In the hollow to the west of the church\r\nis part of the farmyard: a pond, a vast barn with one of the noblest red\r\nroofs in these parts, and the ruins of a stone pigeon house of great age\r\nand solidity, buttressed and built as if for a siege, in curious\r\ncontrast to the gentle, pretty purpose for which it was intended.\r\nBetween the church and the hill, and almost adjoining it, is the\r\nfarmhouse, where the church keys are kept--a relic of Alciston Grange\r\n(once the property of Battle Abbey)--with odds and ends of its past life\r\nstill visible, and a flourishing fig-tree at the back, heavy with fruit\r\nwhen I saw it under a September sun. The front of the house looks due\r\neast, across a valley of corn, to Berwick church, on a corresponding\r\nmound, and beyond Berwick to the Downs above Wilmington. And at the foot\r\nof the garden, on the top of the grey wall above the moat, is a long,\r\nnarrow terrace of turf, commanding this eastern view--a terrace meet for\r\nBenedick and Beatrice to pace, exchanging raillery.\r\n\r\nIn Berwick church, by the way, is a memorial to George Hall, a former\r\nrector, of whom it is said that his name \"speaks all learning humane and\r\ndivine,\" and that his memory is \"precious both to the Muses and the\r\nGraces.\" The Reverend George Hall's works seem, however, to have\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LONG MAN]\r\n\r\nWilmington, north-east of Alfriston, occupies a corresponding position\r\nto that of Alciston in the north-west; but having a \"lion\" in the shape\r\nof the Long Man it has lost its virginal bloom. Wilmington is providing\r\ntea and ginger beer while Alciston nurses its unsullied inaccessibility.\r\nThe Long Man is a rude figure cut in the turf by the monks of the\r\nBenedictine priory that once flourished here, the ruins of which are now\r\nincorporated (like Alciston Grange) in a farm house on the east of the\r\nvillage. At least, it is thought by some antiquaries that the effigy is\r\nthe work of the monks; others pronounce it druidical. The most alluring\r\nof several theories, indeed, would have the figure to represent Pol or\r\nBalder, the Sun God, pushing aside the doors of darkness--Polegate (or\r\nBolsgate) near by being brought in as evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nSMUGGLING\r\n\r\n     The Cuckmere Valley--Alfriston smuggling foreordained--Desperado\r\n     and benefactor--A witty minister--Hawker of Morwenstowe--The church\r\n     and run spirits--The two smugglers, the sea smuggler and the land\r\n     smuggler--The half-way house--The hollow ways of Sussex--Mr. Horace\r\n     Hutchinson quoted--Burwash as a smuggler's cradle.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfriston's place in history was won by its smugglers. All Sussex\r\nsmuggled more or less; but smuggling may be said to have been\r\nAlfriston's industry. Cuckmere Haven, close by, offered unique\r\nadvantages: it was retired, the coast was unpopulated, the roadway\r\ninland started immediately from the beach, the valley was in friendly\r\nhands, the paths and contours of the hills were not easily learned by\r\nrevenue men. Nature from the first clearly intended that Alfriston men\r\nshould be too much for the excise; smuggling was predestined. Farmers,\r\nshepherds, ostlers, what you will that is respectable, these Alfriston\r\nmen might be by day and when the moon was bright; but when the \"darks\"\r\ncame round they were smugglers every one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MR. BETTS'S READINESS]\r\n\r\nChief of what was known nearly a hundred years ago as the \"Alfriston\r\nGang\" was Stanton Collins, who lived at Market Cross House. Collins\r\nemployed his men not only in assisting him in smuggling, but for other\r\npurposes removed from that calling by a wide gulf. Thus when Mr. Betts,\r\nthe minister of the Lady Huntingdon chapel at Alfriston, was\r\nhigh-handedly suspended by the chief trustee of the chapel, on account\r\nof his opposition to that gentleman's proposed union with his deceased\r\nwife's sister, it was Collins's gang who invaded the chapel, ejected the\r\nnew minister, replaced Mr. Betts in the pulpit, and mounted guard round\r\nit while he continued the service. Mr. Betts was equal to the occasion:\r\nhe gave out the hymn \"God moves in a mysterious way.\"\r\n\r\nCollins terrorised the country-side for some years (except upon the\r\nscore of personal bravery and humorous audacity, I doubt if his place is\r\nquite on the golden roll of smugglers) and was at length brought within\r\nthe power of the law for sheep-stealing, and sentenced to seven years.\r\nThe last of his gang, Bob Hall, died in the workhouse at Eastbourne in\r\n1895, aged ninety-four.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CHURCH COMPLAISANT]\r\n\r\nSussex may always be proud of her best smugglers. There were brutal\r\nscoundrels among them, such as the men that murdered Chater and were\r\nexecuted at Chichester in 1748 (the report may be read in Mr. H. L.\r\nStephen's _State Trials_, vol. iv.); but the ordinary smuggler was often\r\na fine rebellious fellow, courageous, resourceful, and gifted with a\r\ncertain grim humour that led him, as we have seen, to hide his tubs as\r\noften in the belfry or the churchyard as anywhere else, and enough\r\nknowledge of character to tell him when he might secure the silence of\r\nthe vicar with an oblatory keg. The Sussex clergy seemed to have needed\r\nvery little encouragement to omit smuggling from the decalogue. It is, I\r\nthink, the late Mr. Coker Egerton, of Burwash, who tells of a Sussex\r\nparson feigning illness a whole Sunday on hearing suddenly in the\r\nmorning that a cargo, hard pressed by the revenue, had in despair been\r\nlodged among his pews. But the classical passage on this subject comes\r\nfrom Cornwall, from the pen of R. S. Hawker, the vicar of Morwenstowe\r\nand the author of \"The Song of the Western Men.\" He was not himself a\r\nsmuggler, but his parishioners had no scruples, and his heart was with\r\nthe braver side of the business:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     It was full sea in the evening of an autumn day when a traveller\r\n     arrived where the road ran along by a sandy beach just above\r\n     high-water mark. The stranger, who was a native of some inland\r\n     town, and utterly unacquainted with Cornwall and its ways, had\r\n     reached the brink of the tide just as a \"landing\" was coming off.\r\n     It was a scene not only to instruct a townsman, but also to dazzle\r\n     and surprise. At sea, just beyond the billows, lay the vessel, well\r\n     moored with anchors at stem and stern. Between the ship and the\r\n     shore boats, laden to the gunwale, passed to and fro. Crowds\r\n     assembled on the beach to help the cargo ashore. On the one hand a\r\n     boisterous group surrounded a keg with the head knocked in, for\r\n     simplicity of access to the good cognac, into which they dipped\r\n     whatsoever vessel came first to hand; one man had filled his shoe.\r\n     On the other side they fought and wrestled, cursed and swore.\r\n     Horrified at what he saw, the stranger lost all self-command, and,\r\n     oblivious of personal danger, he began to shout, \"What a horrible\r\n     sight! Have you no shame? Is there no magistrate at hand? Cannot\r\n     any justice of the peace be found in this fearful country?\"\r\n\r\n     \"No; thanks be to God,\" answered a hoarse, gruff voice. \"None\r\n     within eight miles.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Well, then,\" screamed the stranger, \"is there no clergyman\r\n     hereabout? Does no minister of the parish live among you on this\r\n     coast?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Aye! to be sure there is,\" said the same deep voice.\r\n\r\n     \"Well, how far off does he live? Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n     \"That's he, sir, yonder, with the lanthorn.\" And sure enough there\r\n     he stood, on a rock, and poured, with pastoral diligence, 'the\r\n     light of other days' on a busy congregation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clergy, however, did not always know how useful they were. The Rev.\r\nWebster Whistler, of Hastings, records that he was awakened one night to\r\nreceive a votive cask of brandy as his share of the spoil which, to his\r\nsurprise, his church tower had been harbouring. A commoner method was to\r\nleave the gift--the tithe--silently on the doorstep. Revenue officers\r\nhave perhaps been placated in the same way.\r\n\r\nSmuggling, in the old use of the word, is no more. The surreptitious\r\nintroduction into this country of German cigars, eau de Cologne, and\r\nTauchnitz novels, does not merit the term. A revised tariff having\r\nremoved the necessity for smuggling, the game is over; for that is the\r\nreason of the disappearance of the smuggler rather than any increased\r\nvigilance on the part of the coastguard. The records of smuggling show\r\nthat the difficulties offered to the profession by the Government were\r\ndifficulties that existed merely to be overcome. Perhaps fiscal reform\r\nmay restore the old pastime.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LAND SMUGGLER]\r\n\r\nThe word smuggler arouses in the mind the figure of a bold and desperate\r\nmariner searching the coast for a signal that all is safe to land his\r\ncargo. But as a matter of fact the men who ran the greatest risks were\r\nnot the marine smugglers at all, but the land smugglers who received the\r\ntubs on the shore and conveyed them to a hiding place preparatory to the\r\njourney to London, whither the major part was perilously taken. Such\r\nwere the Alfriston smugglers. These were the men who fought the revenue\r\nofficers and had the hair's-breadth escapes. These were the men whose\r\nhouses were watched, whose every movement was suspected, who needed to\r\nbe wily as the serpent and to know the country inch by inch.\r\n\r\nNot that the sea smuggler ran no risks. On the contrary, he was\r\ncontinually in danger from revenue cutters and the coastguards' boats.\r\nBloody fights in the Channel were by no means rare. He was also often in\r\nperil from the elements; his endurance was superb; he had to be a sailor\r\nof genius, ready for every kind of emergency. But the land smuggler was\r\nmore vulnerable than the sea smuggler, his rewards were smaller, and his\r\noperations were less simple. There is a vast difference between a dark\r\nnight at sea and a dark night on land. Once the night fell the sea was\r\nthe smuggler's own: he was invisible, inaudible. But the land was not\r\nless the revenue officer's: the land smuggler had to show his signal\r\nlight, he had to roll casks over the beach, he had to carry them into\r\nsecurity. His horse's hoofs could not be stilled as oars are muffled,\r\nhis wheels bit noisily into the road, he was liable to be stopped at any\r\nturn. And he ran these risks from the coast right into London. I doubt\r\nif the land smuggler has had his due of praise. Sometimes the land\r\nsmuggler had to be land smuggler and sea smuggler too, for many of the\r\nships never troubled to make a landing at all. They sailed as near the\r\nshore as might be and then sank the tubs, which were always lashed\r\ntogether and kept on deck in readiness to be thrown overboard in case of\r\nthe approach of a cutter. The position of the mooring having been\r\nconveyed to the confederates on shore, the vessel was at liberty to\r\nreturn to France for another cargo, leaving the responsibility of\r\nfishing up the tubs, and getting them to shore and away, wholly with the\r\nland smuggler.\r\n\r\nAn old pamphlet, entitled, _The Trials of the Smugglers ... at the\r\nAssizes held at East Grinstead, March 13, 14, 15, and 16, 1748-9_, gives\r\nthe following information about the duties and pay of the land smugglers\r\nat that day:--\"Each Man is allowed Half a Guinea a Time, and his\r\nExpenses for Eating and Drinking, a Horse found him, and the Profits of\r\na Dollop of Tea, which is about 13 Pounds Weight, being the Half of a\r\nBag; which Profit, even from the most ordinary of their Teas, comes to\r\n24 or 25 Shillings; and they always make one Journey, sometimes two, in\r\na Week.\" But these men would be underlings. There were, I take it, land\r\nsmugglers in control of the operations who shared on a more lordly scale\r\nwith their brethren in the boat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HALF-WAY HOUSES]\r\n\r\nOn all the routes employed by the land smugglers were certain cottages\r\nand farm-houses where tubs might be hidden. Houses still abound supplied\r\nwith unexpected recesses and vast cellars where cargoes were stored on\r\ntheir way to London. In many cases, in the old days, these houses were\r\n\"haunted,\" to put forth the legend of a ghost being the simplest way not\r\nonly of accounting for such nocturnal noises as might be occasioned by\r\nthe arrival or departure of smugglers and tubs, but also of keeping\r\ninquisitive folks at bay. Only a little while ago, during alterations to\r\nan old cottage high on the hills near my home in Kent, corroboration was\r\ngiven to a legend crediting the place with being a smuggler's \"half-way\r\nhouse,\" by the builders' discovery of a cavern under the garden\r\ncommunicating with the cellar. For the gaining of such fastnesses the\r\nhollow ways of Sussex were maintained. Parson Darby's smuggling\r\nsuccessor, in Mr. Horace Hutchinson's Sussex romance, _A Friend of\r\nNelson_, thus described them to the hero of Withyham:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The sun strikes hot enough. Would you like to ride in the shade\r\n     awhile?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Immensely,\" I replied, \"if I saw the shade.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Keep after me, then,\" said he; \"but the roan will. You need not\r\n     trouble!\" In a moment, on his great big horse, he was forcing his\r\n     way down what had looked to me no more than a rabbit-run through\r\n     the roadside bushes. For a while I had noticed the road seemed\r\n     flanked by a mass of boskage below it on the right-hand side. Into\r\n     this, and downward, the man crammed his horse, squeezing his legs\r\n     into the horse's flank. I followed closely, and in a yard or two\r\n     found myself in a deep lane or cutting, very thickly overgrown, so\r\n     that only occasional gleams of sunshine crept in through the\r\n     leafage. We rode, as he had promised, in a most pleasant shade. The\r\n     floor of this lane or passage was not of the smoothest, and we went\r\n     at a foot's pace only, and in Indian file.\r\n\r\n     \"What is the meaning of it all?\" I asked him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE HOLLOW WAYS]\r\n\r\n     \"Well,\" said he, \"you have heard, I suppose, of the 'hollow ways,'\r\n     as they are called, of Sussex. This is one. They were in their\r\n     origin lanes, I take it, and perhaps the only means of getting\r\n     about the country. The rains, in this sandy soil, washing down,\r\n     gradually deepened and deepened them. Folks grew to use the new\r\n     roads as they were made, leaving the lanes unheeded, to be\r\n     overgrown. Here and there certain base fellows of the lewder sort,\r\n     commonly called smugglers, may have deepened them further, and\r\n     improved on what Nature had begun so well, with the result that you\r\n     can ride many a mile, mole-like, if you know your way, from the sea\r\n     coast north'ard, never showing your face above ground at all. That\r\n     is what it means,\" he ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"THE GENTLEMEN\"]\r\n\r\nSmuggling was in the blood of the Sussex people. As the Cornishman said\r\nto Mr. Hawker, \"Why should the King tax good liquor?\" Why, indeed?\r\nEveryone sided with the smugglers, both on the coast and inland. A\r\nBurwash woman told Mr. Egerton that as a child, after saying her\r\nprayers, she was put early to bed with the strict injunction, \"Now,\r\nmind, if the gentlemen come along, don't you look out of the window.\"\r\nThe gentlemen were the smugglers, and not to look at them was a form of\r\nnegative help, since he that has not seen a gentleman cannot identify\r\nhim. Another Burwash character said that his grandfather had fourteen\r\nchildren, all of whom were \"brought up to be smugglers.\" These would, of\r\ncourse, be land smugglers--Burwash being on a highway convenient for the\r\ngentlemen between the coast and the capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nGLYNDE AND RINGMER\r\n\r\n     Mount Caburn--The lark's song--William Hay, the poet of\r\n     Caburn--Glynde church and Glynde place--John Ellman--The South Down\r\n     sheep--Arthur Young--Ringmer and William Penn--The Ringmer mud--The\r\n     ballad of \"The Ride to Church\"--Oxen on the Hills--The old Sussex\r\n     roads--Bad travelling--Ringmer and Gilbert White.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the pleasantest short walks from Lewes takes one over Mount\r\nCaburn to Glynde, from Glynde to Ringmer, and from Ringmer over the\r\nhills to Lewes again.\r\n\r\nThe path to Mount Caburn winds upward just beyond the turn of the road\r\nto Glynde, under the Cliffe. Caburn is not one of the highest of the\r\nDowns (a mere 490 feet, whereas Firle Beacon across the valley is\r\nupwards of 700): but it is one of the friendliest of them, for on its\r\nvery summit is a deep grassy hollow (relic of ancient British\r\nfortification) where on the windiest day one may rest in that perfect\r\npeace that comes only after climbing. Caburn is not unique in this\r\nrespect; there is, for example, a similar hollow in the hill above\r\nKingly Vale; but Caburn has a deeper cavity than any other that I can\r\nrecall. On the roughest day, thus cupped, one may hear, almost see, the\r\ngale go by overhead; and on such a mild spring day as that when I was\r\nlast there, towards the end of April, there is no such place in which to\r\nlie and listen to the lark. If one were asked to name an employment\r\nconsistent with perfect idleness it would be difficult to suggest a\r\nbetter than that of watching a lark melting out of sight into the sky,\r\nand then finding it again. This you may do in Caburn's hollow as\r\nnowhere else. The song of the lark thus followed by eye and ear--for\r\nsong and bird become one--passes naturally into the music of the\r\nspheres: there exist in the universe only yourself and this cosmic\r\ntwitter.\r\n\r\nThe Lewes golfers, of both sexes, pursue their sport some way towards\r\nCaburn, and in the valley below the volunteers fire at their butts; but\r\nI doubt if the mountain proper will ever be tamed. Picnics are held on\r\nthe summit on fine summer days, but for the greater part of the year it\r\nbelongs to the horseman, the shepherd and the lark.\r\n\r\nMount Caburn gave its title to a poem by William Hay, of Glyndebourne\r\nHouse, in 1730, which ends with these lines, in the manner of an\r\nepitaph, upon their author:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Here liv'd the Man, who to these fair Retreats\r\n     First drew the Muses from their ancient Seats:\r\n     Tho' low his Thought, tho' impotent his Strain,\r\n     Yet let me never of his Song complain;\r\n     For this the fruitless Labour recommends,\r\n     He lov'd his native Country, and his Friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Hay (1695-1755) was author also of a curious Essay on Deformity,\r\nwhich Charles Lamb liked, and of several philosophical works, and was a\r\nvery diligent member of Parliament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Glynde._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GLYNDE]\r\n\r\nDescending Caburn's eastern slope, and passing at the foot the mellowest\r\nbarn roof in the county, beautifully yellowed by weather and time, we\r\ncome to Glynde, remarkable among Sussex villages for a formal Grecian\r\nchurch that might have been ravished from a Surrey Thames-side village\r\nand set down here, so little resemblance has it to the indigenous Sussex\r\nHouse of God. As a matter of fact it was built in 1765 by the Bishop of\r\nDurham--the Bishop being Richard Trevor, of the family that then owned\r\nGlynde Place; which is hard by the church, a fine Elizabethan mansion, a\r\nlittle sombre, and very much in the manner of the great houses in the\r\nlate S. E. Waller's pictures, the very place for a clandestine interview\r\nor midnight elopement. The present owner, a descendant of the Trevors\r\nand of the famous John Hampden, enemy of the Star Chamber and ship\r\nmoney, is Admiral Brand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JOHN ELLMAN]\r\n\r\nGlynde's most famous inhabitant was John Ellman (1753-1832) the breeder\r\nof sheep, who farmed here from 1780 to 1829 and was the village's kindly\r\nautocrat and a true father to his men. The last of the patriarchs, as he\r\nmight be called, Ellman lodged all his unmarried labourers under his own\r\nroof, giving them when they married enough grassland for a pig and a\r\ncow, and a little more for cultivation. He built a school for the\r\nchildren of his men, and permitted no licensed house to exist in\r\nGlynde. Not that he objected to beer; on the contrary he considered it\r\nthe true beverage for farm labourers; but he preferred that they should\r\nbrew it at home. It was John Ellman who gave the South Down sheep its\r\nfame and brought it to perfection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARTHUR YOUNG]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting account of South Down sheep is to be found in\r\nArthur Young's _General View of the Agriculture of the County of\r\nSussex_, which is one of those books that, beginning their lives as\r\npractical, instructive and somewhat dry manuals, mellow, as the years go\r\nby, into human documents. Taken sentence by sentence Young has no charm,\r\nbut his book has in the mass quite a little of it, particularly if one\r\nloves Sussex. He studied the country carefully, with special emphasis\r\nupon the domain of the Earl of Egremont, an agricultural reformer of\r\nmuch influence, whom we have met as a collector of pictures and the\r\nfriend of painters. For the Earl not only brought Turner into Sussex\r\nwith his brushes and palette, but introduced a plough from Suffolk and\r\ndevised a new light waggon. The other hero of Young's book is\r\nnecessarily John Ellman, whose flock at Glynde he subjected to close\r\nexamination. Thomas Ellman, of Shoreham, John's cousin, he also approved\r\nas a breeder of sheep, but it is John that stood nighest the Earl of\r\nEgremont on Young's ladder of approbation. John Ellman's sheep were\r\nconsidered the first of their day, equally for their meat and their\r\nwool. I will not quote from Young to any great extent, lest vegetarian\r\nreaders exclaim; but the following passage from his analysis of the\r\nSouth Down type must be transplanted here for its pleasant carnal\r\nvigour: \"The shoulders are wide; they are round and straight in the\r\nbarrel; broad upon the loin and hips; shut well in the twist, which is a\r\nprojection of flesh in the inner part of the thigh that gives a fulness\r\nwhen viewed behind, and makes a South Down leg of mutton remarkably\r\nround and short, more so than in most other breeds.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SOUTH DOWN SHEEP]\r\n\r\nJohn Ellman by no means satisfied all his fellow breeders that he was\r\nright. His neighbour at Glynde, Mr. Morris, differed from him in the\r\nmatter of crossing, and his cousin Thomas had other views on many points\r\ntouching the flock. In the following passage Arthur Young expresses the\r\nextent to which individuality in sheep breeding may run:--\"The South\r\nDown farmers breed their sheep with faces and legs of a colour, just as\r\nsuits their fancy. One likes black, another sandy, a third speckled, and\r\none and all exclaim against white. This man concludes that legs and\r\nfaces with an inclination to white are infallible signs of tenderness,\r\nand do not stand against the severity of the weather with the same\r\nhardiness as the darker breed; and they allege that these sorts will\r\nfall off in their flesh. A second will set the first right, and\r\npronounce that, in a lot of wethers, those that are soonest and most\r\nfat, are white-faced; that they prove remarkable good milkers; but that\r\nwhite is an indication of a tender breed. Another is of opinion that, by\r\nbreeding the lambs too black, the wool is injured, and likewise apt to\r\nbe tainted with black, and spotted, especially about the neck, and not\r\nsaleable. A fourth breeds with legs and faces as black as it is\r\npossible; and he too is convinced that the healthiness is in proportion\r\nto blackness; whilst another says, that if the South Down sheep were\r\nsuffered to run in a wild state, they would in a very few years become\r\nabsolutely black. All these are the opinions of eminent breeders: in\r\norder to reconcile them, others breed for speckled faces; and it is the\r\nprevailing colour.\"\r\n\r\nIt is told that when the Duke of Newcastle used to pass through Glynde,\r\non his way from Halland House, near East Hoathly, to Bishopstone, the\r\npeal of welcome was rung on ploughshares, since there was but one bell.\r\n\r\nRingmer, which lies about two miles north of Glynde, is not in itself a\r\nvillage of much beauty. Its distinction is to have provided William Penn\r\nwith a wife--Gulielma Springett, daughter of Sir William Springett, a\r\nPuritan, whose bust is in the church and who died at the siege of\r\nArundel Castle. The great Quaker thus took to wife the daughter of a\r\nsoldier. When Gulielma Penn died, at the age of fifty, her husband wrote\r\nof her: \"She was a Publick, as well as Private Loss; for she was not\r\nonly an excellent Wife and Mother, but an Entire and Constant Friend, of\r\na more than common Capacity, and greater Modesty and Humility; yet most\r\nequal and undaunted in Danger. Religious as well as Ingenuous, without\r\nAffectation. An easie Mistress, and Good Neighbour, especially to the\r\nPoor. Neither lavish nor penurious, but an Example of Industry as well\r\nas of other Vertues: Therefore our great Loss tho' her own Eternal\r\nGain.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GODLY WIVES]\r\n\r\nIn Ringmer Church, I might add, is a monument to Mrs. Jeffray (_née_\r\nMayney), wife of Francis Jeffray of South Malling, with another\r\nbeautiful testimony to the character of a good wife:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Wise, modest, more than can be marshall'd heere,\r\n     (Her many vertues would a volume fill)\r\n     For all heaven's gifts--in many single sett--\r\n     In Jeffray's _Maney_ altogether mett.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A DETERMINED CHURCHWOMAN]\r\n\r\nRingmer was long famous for its mud and bad roads. Defoe (or another)\r\nsays in the _Tour through Great Britain_:--\"I travelled through the\r\ndirtiest, but, in many respects, the richest and most profitable country\r\nin all that part of England. The timber I saw here was prodigious, as\r\nwell in quantity as in bigness; and seemed in some places to be suffered\r\nto grow only because it was so far from any navigation, that it was not\r\nworth cutting down and carrying away. In dry summers, indeed, a great\r\ndeal is conveyed to Maidstone and other places on the Medway; and\r\nsometimes I have seen one tree on a carriage, which they call in Sussex\r\na tug, drawn by twenty-two oxen; and, even then, it is carried so little\r\na way, and thrown down, and left for other tugs to take up and carry on,\r\nthat sometimes it is two or three years before it gets to Chatham. For,\r\nif once the rain comes on, it stirs no more that year, and sometimes a\r\nwhole summer is not dry enough to make the road passable. Here I had a\r\nsight which, indeed, I never saw in any part of England before--namely,\r\nthat going to a church at a country village, not far from Lewes, I saw\r\nan ancient lady, and a lady of very good quality, I assure you, drawn to\r\nchurch in her coach by six oxen; nor was it done in frolick or humour,\r\nbut from sheer necessity, the way being so stiff and deep that no horses\r\ncould go in it.\" The old lady was not singular in her method of\r\nattending service, for another writer records seeing Sir Herbert\r\nSpringett, father of Sir William, drawn to church by eight oxen: a\r\ndetermination to get to his pew at any cost that led to the composition\r\nof the following ballad, which is now printed for the first time:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE RIDE TO CHURCH]\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE RIDE TO CHURCH.\r\n\r\n      \"A true sonne of the Church of England.\"\r\n                            _Epitaph on Sir Herbert Springett,\r\n                                        in Ringmer Church._\r\n\r\n     Let others sing the wild career\r\n     Of Turpin, Gilpin, Paul Revere.\r\n     A gentler pace is mine. But hear!\r\n\r\n     The raindrops fell, splash! thud! splash! thud!\r\n     Till half the country-side was flood,\r\n     And Ringmer was a waste of mud.\r\n\r\n     The sleepy Ouse had grown a sea,\r\n     Where here and there a drowning tree\r\n     Cast up its arms beseechingly;\r\n\r\n     And cattle that in fairer days\r\n     Beside its banks were wont to graze\r\n     Now viewed the scene in mild amaze,\r\n\r\n     And, huddled on an island mound,\r\n     Sent forth so dolorous a sound\r\n     As made the sadness more profound.\r\n\r\n     And then--at last--one Sunday broke\r\n     When villagers, delighted, woke\r\n     To find the sun had flung its cloak\r\n\r\n     Of leaden-coloured cloud aside.\r\n     All jubilant they watched him ride,\r\n     For see, the land was glorified:\r\n\r\n     The morning pulsed with youth and mirth,\r\n     It was as though upon the earth\r\n     A new and gladder age had birth.\r\n\r\n     The lark exulted in the blue,\r\n     Triumphantly the rooster crew,\r\n     The chimneys laughed, the sparks up-flew;\r\n\r\n     And rolling westward out of sight,\r\n     Like billows of majestic height,\r\n     The Downs, transfigured in the light,\r\n\r\n     Seemed such a garb of joy to wear,\r\n     So young and radiant an air,\r\n     God might but just have set them there.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Sir Herbert Springett, Ringmer's squire,\r\n     (No better man in all the shire)--\r\n     He too was filled with kindling fire,\r\n\r\n     Which, working in him, did incite\r\n     The worthy and capacious knight\r\n     To doughty deeds of appetite.\r\n\r\n     Sir Herbert's lady watched her lord\r\n     Range mightily about the board\r\n     Which she of her abundance stored,\r\n\r\n     (The Lady Barbara, for whom\r\n     The blossoms of the simple-room\r\n     Diffused their friendliest perfume,\r\n\r\n     Than who none quicklier heard the call\r\n     Of true distress, and left the Hall\r\n     Eager to do her gentle all,\r\n\r\n     When village patients needed aid.\r\n     And O the rich Marchpane she made!\r\n     And O the rare quince marmalade!)\r\n\r\n     Just as the squire was satisfied,\r\n     The noise of feet was heard outside;\r\n     A knock. \"Come in!\" Sir Herbert cried.\r\n\r\n     And lo! John Grigg in Sunday smock;\r\n     Begged pardon, pulled an oily lock;\r\n     Explained: \"The mud's above the hough.\r\n\r\n     \"No horse could draw 'ee sir,\" he said.\r\n     \"Humph!\" quoth the squire and scratched his head.\r\n     \"Then yoke the oxen in instead.\"\r\n\r\n     (A lesser man would gladly turn\r\n     His chair to fire again, and learn\r\n     How fancifully logs can burn,\r\n\r\n     Grateful for such immunity\r\n     From parson. Not the squire; for see,\r\n     \"True sonne of England's Church\" was he.)\r\n\r\n     So, as he ordered, was it done.\r\n     The oxen came forth one by one,\r\n     Their wide horns glinting in the sun,\r\n\r\n     And to the coach were yoked. Then--dressed,\r\n     As squires should be, in glorious best,\r\n     With wonderful brocaded vest,--\r\n\r\n     Out came Sir Herbert, took his seat,\r\n     Waved \"Barbara, farewell, my Sweet!\"\r\n     And off they started, all complete.\r\n\r\n     Although they drew so light a load\r\n     (For them!) so heavy was the road,\r\n     John Grigg was busy with his goad.\r\n\r\n     The cottagers in high delight\r\n     Ran out to see the startling sight\r\n     And make obeisance to the knight,\r\n\r\n     While floated through the liquid air,\r\n     And o'er the sunlit meadows fair,\r\n     The throbbing belfry's call to prayer.\r\n\r\n     At last, and after many a lurch\r\n     That shook Sir Herbert in his perch,\r\n     John Grigg drew up before the church;\r\n\r\n     Moreover not a minute late.\r\n     The villagers around the gate\r\n     Were filled with wonder at his state,\r\n\r\n     And, promptly, though 'twas sabbath tide,\r\n     \"Three cheers for squire--Hooray!\" they cried....\r\n     Such was Sir Herbert Springett's ride.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Sad is the sequel, sad but true--\r\n     For while in sermon-time a few\r\n     Deep snores resounded from the pew\r\n\r\n     Reserved for squire, by others there\r\n     The tenth commandment (men declare)\r\n     Was being broken past repair:\r\n\r\n     For, thinking how they had to roam\r\n     Through weary wastes of sodden loam\r\n     Ere they could win to fire and home,\r\n\r\n     In spite of parson's fervid knocks\r\n     Upon his cushion orthodox,\r\n     They \"coveted their neighbour's ox.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OXEN OF THE HILLS]\r\n\r\nOxen are now rarely seen on the Sussex roads, but on the hill sides a\r\nfew of the farmers still plough with them; and may it be long before the\r\nold custom is abandoned! There is no pleasanter or more peaceful sight\r\nthan--looking up--that of a wide-horned team of black oxen, smoking a\r\nlittle in the morning air, drawing the plough through the earth, while\r\nthe ploughman whistles, and the ox-herd, goad in hand, utters his Saxon\r\ngrunts of incitement or reproof. The black oxen of the hills are of\r\nWelsh stock, the true Sussex ox being red. The \"kews,\" as their shoes\r\nare called, may still be seen on the walls of a smithy here and there.\r\nShoeing oxen is no joke, since to protect the smith from their horns\r\nthey have to be thrown down; their necks are held by a pitchfork, and\r\ntheir feet tied together.\r\n\r\nSussex roads were terrible until comparatively recent times. An old\r\nrhyme credits \"Sowseks\" with \"dirt and myre,\" and Dr. Burton, the author\r\nof the _Iter Sussexiensis_, humorously found in it a reason why Sussex\r\npeople and beasts had such long legs. \"Come now, my friend,\" he wrote,\r\nin Greek, \"I will set before you a sort of problem in Aristotle's\r\nfashion:--Why is it that the oxen, the swine, the women, and all other\r\nanimals, are so long legged in Sussex? May it be from the difficulty of\r\npulling the feet out of so much mud by the strength of the ankle, that\r\nthe muscles get stretched, as it were, and the bones lengthened?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROUGH ROADS]\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1703, the King of Spain visited the Duke of Somerset at\r\nPetworth he had the greatest difficulty in getting here. One of his\r\nattendants has put on record the perils of the journey:--\"We set out at\r\nsix o'clock in the morning (at Portsmouth) to go to Petworth, and did\r\nnot get out of the coaches, save only when we were overturned or stuck\r\nfast in the mire, till we arrived at our journey's end. 'Twas hard\r\nservice for the prince to sit fourteen hours in the coach that day,\r\nwithout eating anything, and passing through the worst ways that I ever\r\nsaw in my life: we were thrown but once indeed in going, but both our\r\ncoach which was leading, and his highness's body coach, would have\r\nsuffered very often, if the nimble boors of Sussex had not frequently\r\npoised it, or supported it with their shoulders, from Godalming almost\r\nto Petworth; and the nearer we approached the duke's, the more\r\ninaccessible it seemed to be. The last nine miles of the way cost six\r\nhours time to conquer.\"\r\n\r\nTo return to Ringmer, it was there that Gilbert White studied the\r\ntortoise (see Letter xiii of _The Natural History of Selborne_). The\r\nhouse where he stayed still stands, and the rookery still exists. \"These\r\nrooks,\" wrote the naturalist, \"retire every morning all the winter from\r\nthis rookery, where they only call by the way, as they are going to\r\nroost in deep woods; at the dawn of day they always revisit their\r\nnest-trees, and are preceded a few minutes by a flight of daws, that\r\nact, as it were, as their harbingers.\" An intermediate owner of the\r\nhouse where Gilbert White resided, which then belonged to his aunt\r\nRebecca Snooke, ordered all nightingales to be shot, on the ground that\r\nthey kept him awake.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLASHETTS]\r\n\r\nWhile at Ringmer, if a glimpse of very rich park land is needed, it\r\nwould be worth while to walk three miles north to Plashetts, which\r\ncombines a vast tract of wood with a small park notable at once for its\r\ntrees, its brake fern, its lakes, and its water fowl. But if one would\r\ngain it by rail, Isfield is the station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nUCKFIELD AND BUXTED\r\n\r\n     The Crowborough district--Isfield--Another model\r\n     wife--Framfield--The poet Realf--Uckfield--The Maresfield\r\n     rocks--Puritan names in Sussex--Buxted park--Heron's Ghyll--A\r\n     perfect church.\r\n\r\n\r\nUckfield, on the line from Lewes to Tunbridge Wells, is our true\r\nstarting point for the high sandy and rocky district of Crowborough,\r\nRotherfield and Mayfield; but we must visit on the way Isfield, a very\r\npretty village on the Ouse and its Iron River tributary. Isfield is\r\nremarkable for the remains of Isfield Place, once the home of the\r\nShurleys (connected only by marriage with the Shirleys of Wiston). The\r\nhouse can never have been so fine as Slaugham Place, but it is evident\r\nthat abundance also reigned here, as there. Over the main door was the\r\nmotto \"Non minor est virtus quam querere parta tueri,\" which Horsfield\r\nwhimsically translates \"Catch is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.\"\r\nIn the Shurley chapel, one of the sweetest spots in Sussex, are brasses\r\nand monuments to the family, notably the canopied altar tomb to Sir John\r\nShurley, who died in 1631, his two wives (Jane Shirley of Wiston and\r\nDorothy Bowyer, _née_ Goring, of Cuckfield) and nine children, who kneel\r\nprettily in a row at the foot. Of these children it is said in the\r\ninscription that some \"were called into Heaven and the others into\r\nseveral marriages of good quality\"; while of Dorothy Shurley it is\r\nprettily recorded (this, as we have seen, being a district rich in\r\nexemplary wives) that she had \"a merite beyond most of her time, ...\r\nher pitty was the clothing of the poore ... and all her minutes were but\r\nsteppes to heaven.\" Our county has many fine monuments, but I think\r\nthat, this is the most charming of all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAMFIELD]\r\n\r\nAt Framfield, two miles east of Uckfield, which we may take here, we\r\nagain enter the iron country, and for the first time see Sussex hops,\r\nwhich are grown largely to the north and east of this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Framfield._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RICHARD REALF]\r\n\r\nFramfield has a Tudor church and no particular interest. In 1792 eleven\r\nout of fifteen persons in Framfield, whose united ages amounted to one\r\nthousand and thirty-four years, offered, through the county paper, to\r\nplay a cricket match with an equal number of the same age from any part\r\nof Sussex; but I do not find any record of the result. Nor can I find\r\nthat any one at Framfield is proud of the fact that here, in 1834, was\r\nborn Richard Realf, the orator and poet, son of Sussex peasants. In\r\nEngland his name is scarcely known; and in America, where his work was\r\ndone, it is not common knowledge that he was by birth and parentage\r\nEnglish. Realf was the friend of man, liberty and John Brown; he fought\r\nagainst slavery in the war, and helped the cause with some noble verses;\r\nand he died miserably by his own hand in 1878, leaving these lines\r\nbeside his body:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"De mortuis nil nisi bonum.\" When\r\n       For me this end has come and I am dead,\r\n     And the little voluble, chattering daws of men\r\n       Peck at me curiously, let it then be said\r\n     By some one brave enough to speak the truth:\r\n       Here lies a great soul killed by cruel wrong.\r\n     Down all the balmy days of his fresh youth\r\n       To his bleak, desolate noon, with sword and song,\r\n     And speech that rushed up hotly from the heart,\r\n       He wrought for liberty, till his own wound\r\n     (He had been stabbed), concealed with painful art\r\n       Through wasting years, mastered him, and he swooned,\r\n     And sank there where you see him lying now\r\n     With the word \"Failure\" written on his brow.\r\n\r\n     But say that he succeeded. If he missed\r\n       World's honors, and world's plaudits, and the wage\r\n     Of the world's deft lacqueys, still his lips were kissed\r\n       Daily by those high angels who assuage\r\n     The thirstings of the poets--for he was\r\n       Born unto singing--and a burthen lay\r\n     Mightily on him, and he moaned because\r\n       He could not rightly utter to the day\r\n     What God taught in the night. Sometimes, nathless,\r\n       Power fell upon him, and bright tongues of flame,\r\n     And blessings reached him from poor souls in stress;\r\n       And benedictions from black pits of shame,\r\n     And little children's love, and old men's prayers,\r\n     And a Great Hand that led him unawares.\r\n\r\n     So he died rich. And if his eyes were blurred\r\n       With big films--silence! he is in his grave.\r\n     Greatly he suffered; greatly, too, he erred;\r\n       Yet broke his heart in trying to be brave.\r\n     Nor did he wait till Freedom had become\r\n       The popular shibboleth of courtier's lips;\r\n     He smote for her when God Himself seemed dumb\r\n       And all His arching skies were in eclipse.\r\n     He was a-weary, but he fought his fight,\r\n       And stood for simple manhood; and was joyed\r\n     To see the august broadening of the light\r\n       And new earths heaving heavenward from the void.\r\n     He loved his fellows, and their love was sweet--\r\n     Plant daisies at his head and at his feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nUckfield's main street is divided sharply into two periods--from the\r\nstation to the road leading to the church all is new; beyond, all is\r\nold. The town is not interesting in itself, but it commands good\r\ncountry, and has a good inn, the Maiden's Head. It is also a good\r\nspecimen of the quieter market-town of the past--with a brewery (hiding\r\nbehind a wonderful tree braced with kindly iron bands), a water mill\r\n(down by the railway), and several solid comfortable houses for the\r\ndoctor and the lawyer and the brewer and the parson, with ample gardens\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nUckfield was once the home of Jeremiah Markland, the great classic, who\r\nacted as tutor here to Edward Clarke, son of the famous William Clarke,\r\nrector of Buxted, and father of Edward Daniel Clarke, the traveller. It\r\nis agreeable to remember that Fanny Burney passed through the town with\r\nMrs. Thrale in 1779, although she found nothing to interest her.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE UCKFIELD ROCKS]\r\n\r\nUckfield is the southern boundary of the rock district of which we saw\r\nsomething at West Hoathly, and it is famous for the sandstone cliffs in\r\nthe grounds of High Rocks, an estate on the south of the town. The\r\nunthinking untidiness and active penknives of the holiday makers made it\r\nrecently necessary for the grounds to be closed to strangers. Close by,\r\nhowever, just off the road from Uckfield to Maresfield, is a rocky tract\r\nthat is free to all. It consists of about an acre of grey, sandy\r\nboulders, some rising to a height of twenty feet or so, which remind one\r\na little of the _rochers_ in the Forest of Fontainebleau, although on a\r\nsmaller scale. All are worn with the feet of adventurous boys enjoying\r\none of the best natural playgrounds in the county. Here blackberries\r\ncome to rich perfection, the sun's ripening warmth being thrown back\r\nfrom the hot sand.\r\n\r\nWhen I first knew Maresfield church, many years ago, its aged vicar\r\nrolled out \"Thou shalt do no mur-r-r-der\" with an accusing timbre that\r\nseemed to bring the sin home to all of us. He had also so peculiar a way\r\nof pronouncing \"Albert,\" that his prayer for our rulers seemed to make\r\nan invidious distinction, and ask a blessing, not for all, but for all\r\nbut Edward, Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PURITAN NAMES]\r\n\r\nSome of the oddest of the composite pietistic names that broke out over\r\nEngland during the Puritan revolution are to be found in Sussex\r\nregisters. In 1632, Master Performe-thy-vowes Seers of Maresfield\r\nmarried Thomasine Edwards. His full name was too much for the village,\r\nand four years later is found an entry recording the burial of \"Vowes\r\nSeers\" pure and simple. The searcher of parish registers from whose\r\narticles in the _Sussex Daily News_ I have already quoted, has also\r\nfound that Heathfield had many Puritan names, among them \"Replenished,\"\r\nwhich was given to the daughter of Robert Pryor in 1600. There was also\r\na Heathfield damsel known as \"More-Fruits.\" Mr. Lower prints the\r\nfollowing names from a Sussex jury list in the seventeenth century:\r\nRedeemed Compton of Battel, Stand-fast-on-high Stringer of Crowhurst,\r\nWeep-not Billing of Lewes, Called Lower of Warbleton, Elected Mitchell\r\nof Heathfield, Renewed Wisberry of Hailsham, Fly-fornication Richardson\r\nof Waldron, The-Peace-of-God Knight of Burwash,\r\nFight-the-good-fight-of-Faith White of Ewhurst, and Kill-sin Pemble of\r\nWithyham. Also a Master More-Fruits Fowler of East Hoathly, for it seems\r\nthat in such names there was no sex.\r\n\r\nAmong the curious Sussex surnames found by the student of the county\r\narchives who is quoted above are the following:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Pitchfork    Sweetname  Lies\r\n     Devil        Slybody    Hogsflesh\r\n     Leper        Fidge      Backfield\r\n     Handshut     Beatup     Breathing\r\n     Juglery      Rougehead  Whiskey\r\n     Hollowbone   Punch      Wildgoose\r\n     Stillborne   Padge      Ann.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost every name here would have pleased Dickens, while some might have\r\nbeen invented by him, notably Fidge and Padge. One can almost see Mr.\r\nFidge and Mr. Padge drolling it in his pages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BUXTED DEER]\r\n\r\nFrom the Maresfield rocks Buxted is easily reached, about a mile due\r\neast; but a far prettier approach is through Buxted Park, which is\r\ngained by a footpath out of Uckfield's main street. The charm of Buxted\r\nis its deer. Sussex, as we have seen, is rich in parks containing deer,\r\nbut I know of none other where one may be so certain of coming close to\r\nthese beautiful creatures. Nor can I recall any other deer that are so\r\nexquisitely dappled; but that may be because the Buxted deer were the\r\nfirst I ever saw, thirty years ago, and we like to think the first the\r\nbest. Certainly they are the friendliest, or least timid. The act of\r\ngoing to church is invested at Buxted with an almost unique attraction,\r\nsince the deer lie hard by the path. Indeed, the last time I went to\r\nchurch at Buxted I never passed through the door at all, but sat on a\r\ngravestone throughout the service and watched the herd in its graceful\r\nrestlessness. That was twelve years ago. The other day I watched them\r\nagain and could see no change. Some of the stags were still as of old\r\nalmost bowed beneath their antlers, although one at any rate was free,\r\nfor a keeper who passed carried a pair of horns in his hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In Buxted Park._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RALPH HOGGE]\r\n\r\nThe old house at the beginning of the footpath to the church, with a hog\r\nin bas-relief on its façade, is known as the Hog House, and is said to\r\nhave been the residence of Ralph Hogge. Who was Ralph Hogge? Who is\r\nHiram Maxim? Who was Krupp? Who was Nordenfelt? It was Ralph Hogge,\r\niron-master, who in the year 1543 made the first English metal cannon.\r\nSo at any rate say tradition and Holinshed. Buxted is otherwise most\r\npacific of villages, sleepy and undiscovered. In the early years of the\r\nlast century it boasted the possession of a labourer with a memory of\r\namazing tenacity, one George Watson, who, otherwise almost imbecile, was\r\nunable to forget anything he had once seen, or any figure repeated to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOn the road between Maresfield and Crowborough is Heron's Ghyll, the\r\nresidence of Mr. Fitzalan Hope. It stands to the east of the road, in\r\none of those hollow sites that alone won the word \"eligible\" from a\r\nTudor builder. Hard by the road is the perfect little Early English\r\nRoman Catholic church which Mr. Hope built in 1897, a miracle, in these\r\nhurried florid days, of honest work and simple modest beauty. The church\r\nbeing Roman Catholic one may with confidence turn aside to rest a little\r\nin its cool seclusion, relieved of the irritating search for the sexton\r\nof the national establishment, and freed from his haunting presence and\r\nsuggestion that the labourer is worthy of more than his hire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CLOSED CHURCHES]\r\n\r\nWhile on this subject I might remark that a county vicar describing the\r\nantiquities of his neighbourhood in one of the Sussex Archæological\r\nSociety's volumes, writes magnanimously: \"A debt of gratitude is\r\ncertainly due to our Roman Catholic predecessors (whatever error might\r\nmix itself with their piety and charity) for erecting such noble\r\nedifices, in a style of strength to endure for a late posterity.\" It\r\nseems to me that a very simple way of discharging a portion of this debt\r\nwould be to imitate the excellent habit of leaving the church doors wide\r\nopen, as practised by those Roman Catholic predecessors. My own impulse\r\nto enter many of the Sussex churches has been principally antiquarian or\r\næsthetic, but to rest amid their gray coolnesses is a legitimate desire\r\nwhich should be fostered rather than discouraged, particularly as it is\r\nunder such conditions that the soul even of the stranger whose motive is\r\ncuriosity is often comforted. The arguments in favour of keeping\r\nchurches closed are unknown to me. Doubtless they are numerous and\r\ningenious, but, doubtless equally, a locked church is a confession of\r\nfailure; while to urge that one has but to ask for the key to be able\r\nto enter a church is no true reply, since hospitality, whether to the\r\nbody or the soul, loses in sweetness and effect as it loses in\r\nspontaneity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TO CROWBOROUGH]\r\n\r\nFrom Heron's Ghyll to Crowborough is a steady climb for three miles,\r\nwith the heathery wastes of Ashdown Forest on the left and the hilly\r\ndistrict around Mayfield on the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nCROWBOROUGH AND MAYFIELD\r\n\r\n     Crowborough the suburban--Rotherfield's three rivers--The extra\r\n     ribs--Wild flowers and railway companies--The perfect hill--An arid\r\n     district--St. Dunstan and the Devil--Why Tunbridge Wells waters are\r\n     chalybeate--St. Dunstan's feats--An unencouraging _memento\r\n     mori_--Mayfield church--Mayfield street--The diary of Mr. Walter\r\n     Gale, schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of this year (1903) the walls and fences of Crowborough\r\nwere covered with the placards of a firm of estate agents describing the\r\nneighbourhood (in the manner of the great George Robins) as \"Scotland in\r\nSussex.\" The simile may be true of the Ashdown Forest side of the Beacon\r\n(although involving an unnecessary confusion of terms), but \"Hampstead\r\nin Sussex\" would be a more accurate description of Crowborough proper.\r\nNever was a fine remote hill so be-villa'd. The east slope is all\r\nscaffold-poles and heaps of bricks, new churches and chapels are\r\nsprouting, and the many hoardings announce that Follies, Pierrots, or\r\nconjurors are continually imminent. Crowborough itself has shops that\r\nwould not disgrace Croydon, and a hotel where a Lord Mayor might feel at\r\nhome. Houses in their own grounds are commoner than cottages, and near\r\nthe summit the pegs of surveyors and the name-boards of avenues yet to\r\nbe built testify to the charms which our Saxon Caledonia has already\r\nexerted.\r\n\r\nBut to say this is not to say all. Crowborough may be populous and\r\nover-built; but it is still a glorious eminence, the healthiest and most\r\nbracing inland village in the county, and the key to its best moorland\r\ncountry. Since Crowborough's normal visitor either plays golf or is\r\ncontented with a very modest radius, the more adventurous walker may\r\nquickly be in the solitudes.\r\n\r\nIn the little stone house below the forge Richard Jefferies lived for\r\nsome months at the end of his life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROTHERFIELD]\r\n\r\nCrowborough is crowned by a red hotel which can never pass into the\r\nlandscape; Rotherfield, its companion hill on the east, on the other\r\nside of the Jarvis Brook valley, is surmounted by a beautiful church\r\nwith a tall shingled spire, that must have belonged to the scene from\r\nthe first. This spire darts up from the edge of the forest ridge like a\r\nPharos for the Weald of Kent. The church was dedicated to St. Denis of\r\nParis by a Saxon chieftain who was cured of his ills by a pilgrimage to\r\nthe Saint's monastery. That was in 792. In the present church, which\r\nretains the dedication, is an ancient mural painting representing the\r\nmartyrdom of St. Lawrence. There is also a Burne-Jones window.\r\n\r\nWere it not for Rotherfield both Sussex and Kent would lack some of\r\ntheir waterways, for the Rother and the Ouse rise here, and also the\r\nMedway. A local saying credits the women of Rotherfield with two ribs\r\nmore than the men, to account for their superior height.\r\n\r\nUnder a hedge half-way between Rotherfield and Jarvis Brook grow the\r\nlargest cowslips in Sussex, as large as cowslips may be without changing\r\ntheir sex. But this is all cowslip country--from the field of Rother to\r\nthe field of Uck. And it is the land of the purple orchis too, the\r\nfinest blooms of which are to be found on the road between Rotherfield\r\nand Mayfield; but you must scale a fence to get them, because (like all\r\nthe best wild flowers) they belong to the railway.\r\n\r\nBetween Rotherfield and Mayfield is a little hill, trim and conical as\r\nthough Miss Greenaway had designed it, and perfect in deportment, for it\r\nhas (as all little conical hills should have) a white windmill on its\r\ntop. Around the mill is a circular track for carts, which runs nearer\r\nthe sails than any track I remember ever to have dared to walk on.\r\nStanding by this mill one opens many miles of Kent and Surrey: due north\r\nthe range of chalk Downs on which is the Pilgrim's Way, between Merstham\r\nand Westerham, and in front of that Toy's Hill and Ide Hill and their\r\nsandy companions, on the north edge of the Weald.\r\n\r\nMayfield is a city on a hill on the skirts of the hot hop district of\r\nwhich Burwash is the Sussex centre. To walk about it even in April is no\r\nexhilaration; but in August one thinks of Sahara. I lived in Mayfield\r\none August and could barely keep awake; and we used to look across at\r\nthe rolling chalk Downs in the south, between Ditchling and Lewes, and\r\nlong for their cool, wind-swept heights. They can be hot too, but chalk\r\nis never so hot as sand, and a steady climb to a summit, over turf\r\nodorous of wild thyme, is restful beside the eternal hills and valleys\r\nof the hop district.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SAINT DUNSTAN]\r\n\r\nMayfield has the best street and the best architecture of any of these\r\nhighland villages. Also it has the distinction of having done most for\r\nmankind, since without Mayfield there would have been no water to cure\r\njaded London ladies and gentlemen at Tunbridge Wells. According to\r\nEadmer, who wrote one of the lives of Dunstan, that Saint, when\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, built a wooden church at Mayfield and lived in\r\na cell hard by. St. Dunstan, who was an expert goldsmith, was one day\r\nmaking a chalice (or, as another version of the legend says, a\r\nhorseshoe) when the Devil appeared before him. Instantly recognising his\r\nenemy, and being aware that with such a foe prompt measures alone are\r\nuseful, St. Dunstan at once pulled his nose with the tongs, which\r\nchanced happily to be red hot. Wrenching himself free, the Devil leaped\r\nat one bound from Mayfield to Tunbridge Wells, where, plunging his nose\r\ninto the spring at the foot of the Pantiles, he \"imparted to the water\r\nits chalybeate qualities,\" and thus made the fortune of the town as a\r\nhealth resort. To St. Dunstan therefore, indirectly, are all drinkers of\r\nthese wells indebted. For other drinkers he introduced or invented the\r\npractice of fixing pins in the sides of drinking cups, in order that a\r\nthirsty man might see how he was progressing and a bibulous man be\r\nchecked.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MAYFIELD]\r\n\r\nWhen consecrating his little church at Mayfield St. Dunstan discovered\r\nit to be a little out of the true position, east and west. He therefore\r\napplied his shoulder and rectified the error.\r\n\r\nThe remains of Mayfield Palace, the old abode of the Archbishops of\r\nCanterbury, join the church. After it had passed into the hands of the\r\ncrown--for Cranmer made a bargain with the King by which Mayfield was\r\nexchanged for other property--Sir Thomas Gresham lived here, and Queen\r\nElizabeth has dined under its roof. The Palace is to be seen only\r\noccasionally, for it is now a convent, Mayfield being another of the\r\ncounty's many Roman Catholic outposts. In the great dining-room are the\r\ntongs which St. Dunstan used.\r\n\r\nThe church, dedicated to Mayfield's heroic saint, has one of the broader\r\nshingled spires of Sussex, as distinguished from the slender spires of\r\nwhich Rotherfield is a good example. Standing high, it may be seen from\r\nlong distances. The tower is the original Early English structure. Four\r\nmore of the old Sussex iron tomb slabs may be seen at Mayfield. In the\r\nchurchyard, says Mr. Lower, was once an inscription with this\r\nuncomplimentary first line:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     O reader, if that thou canst read,\r\n\r\n\r\nIt continued:--\r\n\r\n\r\n       Look down upon this stone;\r\n     Death is the man, do you what you can,\r\n       That never spareth none!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Mayfield's street even the new houses have caught comeliness from\r\ntheir venerable neighbours. It undulates from gable to gable, and has\r\ntwo good inns. The old timbered house in the middle of the east side is\r\nthat to which Richard Jefferies refers without enthusiasm in the passage\r\nwhich I quote in a later chapter from his essay on Buckhurst Park. In\r\nLouis Jennings' _Field Paths and Green Lanes_ the house comes in for\r\neulogy.\r\n\r\nVicar of Mayfield in 1361 and following years was John Wickliffe, who\r\nhas too often been confused with his great contemporary and namesake,\r\nthe reformer. And the village claims as a son Thomas May (1595-1650),\r\nplaywright, translator of Lucan's \"Pharsalia,\" secretary to Parliament\r\nand friend of Ben Jonson.\r\n\r\nIn the Sussex Archæological Collections is printed the journal of Walter\r\nGale, schoolmaster at Mayfield in the latter half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, from which a few extracts may be given:\r\n\r\n\"1750. I found the greatest part of the school in a flow, by reason of\r\nthe snow and rain coming through the leads. The following extempore\r\nverse I set for a copy:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Abandon every evil thought\r\n     For they to judgment will be brought.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn passing the Star I met with Mr. Eastwood; we went in and spent 2_d._\r\napiece.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PRESAGES OF DEATH]\r\n\r\n\"I went to Mr. Sawyer's.... One of his daughters said that she expected\r\na change in the weather as she had last night dreamt of a deceased\r\nperson.\" The editor remarks that this superstition still lingers (or did\r\nfifty years ago) in the Weald of Sussex. Walter Gale adds:--\"I told them\r\nin discourse that on Thursday last the town clock was heard to strike 3\r\nin the afternoon twice, once before the chimes went, and a 2nd time\r\npretty nearly a 1/4 of an hour after.... The strikes at the 2nd striking\r\nseemed to sound very dull and mournfully; this, together with the\r\ncrickets coming to the house at Laughton just at our coming away, I look\r\nupon to be sure presages of my sister's death.\"\r\n\r\nA year later:--\"My mother, to my great unhappiness, died in the 83rd\r\nyear of her age, agreeable to the testimony I had of a death in our\r\nfamily on the 10th of May last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rogers came to the school, and brought with him the four volumes of\r\n_Pamela_, for which I paed him 4_s._ 6_d._, and bespoke Duck's _Poems_\r\nfor Mr. Kine, and a _Caution to Swearers_ for myself.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday. I went to church at Hothley.

Gave attendance at a cricket-match, played between the\r\ngamesters at Burwash and Mayfield to the advantage of the latter.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OLD KENT]\r\n\r\nA series of quarrels with old Kent occupy much of the diary. Old Kent,\r\nit seems, used to enter the school house and vilify the master, not, I\r\nimagine, without cause. Thus:--\"He again called me upstart, runagate,\r\nbeggarly dog, clinched his fist in my face, and made a motion to strike\r\nme, and declared he would break my head. He did not strike me, but\r\nwithdrew in a wonderful heat, and ended all with his general maxim, 'The\r\ngreater scholler, the greater rogue!'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gale was removed from the school in 1771 for neglecting his duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nHEATHFIELD AND THE \"LIES.\"\r\n\r\n     The two Heathfields--Heathfield Park--\"Hefful\" Fair and the\r\n     spring--The death of Jack Cade--Warbleton's martyr--Three \"lies\"\r\n     and all true--An ecclesiastical confection--The bloodthirsty\r\n     Colonel Lunsford--Halland--Tarble Down--Breeches Wood--Mr. Thomas\r\n     Turner's diary--Laughton--Chiddingly's inhospitable fane--The\r\n     Jefferay cheese--A devoted campanologist--Hellingly--Hailsham.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two Heathfields: the old village, with its pleasant Sussex\r\nchurch and ancient cottages close to the park gates; and the new brick\r\nand slate town that has gathered round the station and the natural\r\ngas-works. The park lies between the two, remarkable among Sussex parks\r\nfor the variety of its trees and the unusual proportion of them. The\r\nspacious lawns which are characteristic of the parks in the south, here,\r\non Heathfield's sandy undulations, give place to heather, fern and\r\ntrees. I never remember to have seen a richer contrast of greens than in\r\nearly spring, looking west from the house, between the masses of dark\r\nevergreens that had borne the rigours of the winter and the young leaves\r\njust breaking through. Heathfield's park is, I think, the loveliest in\r\nSussex, lying as it does on a southern slope, with its opulence of\r\nfoliage, its many rushing burns (the source of the Cuckmere), its hidden\r\nravines and deep silent tarns, and its wonderful view of the Downs and\r\nthe sea. The park once belonged to the Dacres of Hurstmonceaux, whom we\r\nare about to meet. Traces of the original house, dating probably from\r\nHenry VII.'s reign, are still to be seen in the basement. Upon this\r\nfoundation was imposed a new building towards the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. The park was then known as Bailey Park. A century later, George\r\nAugustus Eliott (afterwards Lord Heathfield), the hero of Gibraltar, and\r\nearlier of Cuba, acquired it with his Havana prize money. After Lord\r\nHeathfield died, in 1790, the park became the property of Francis\r\nNewbery, son of the bookseller of St. Paul's Churchyard. The present\r\nowner, Mr. Alexander, has added greatly to the house.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GIBRALTAR TOWER]\r\n\r\nGibraltar Tower, on the highest point of the park, was built by Newbery\r\nin honour of his predecessor. From its summit a vast prospect is\r\nvisible, and forty churches, it is said, may be counted. I saw but few\r\nof these. In the east, similarly elevated, is seen the Brightling\r\nNeedle. Mr. Alexander has gathered together in the tower a number of\r\nsouvenirs of old English life which make it a Lewes Castle museum in\r\nlittle. Here are stocks, horn glasses, drinking vessels, rushlight\r\nholders, leather bottels, and one of those quaint wooden machines for\r\nteaching babies to walk. An old manuscript history of the tower, in Mr.\r\nAlexander's possession, contains at least one passage that is perhaps\r\nworth noting, as it may help to clear up any confusion that exists in\r\nconnection with Lord Heathfield's marriage. \"The lady to whom his\r\nlordship meant to be united,\" says the historian, \"and who would\r\ncertainly have been his wife had not death stepped in, is the sister of\r\na lady of whom his lordship was extremely fond, but she, dying about ten\r\nyears ago, he transferred his affections to the other, who is about\r\nthirty-five years of age.\"\r\n\r\nA Heathfield worthy of a hundred years ago was Sylvan Harmer, chiefly a\r\nstone cutter (he cut the stone for the tower), but also the modeller in\r\nclay of some very ingenious and pretty bas-relief designs for funeral\r\nurns, notably a group known as Charity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JACK CADE]\r\n\r\nThe following scene from _The Second Part of Henry VI._ although\r\nShakespeare places it in Kent, belongs to a little hamlet known as Cade\r\nStreet, close to Heathfield:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Scene X.--Kent. IDEN'S _Garden._\r\n\r\n     _Enter_ CADE.\r\n\r\n     _Cade._ Fie on ambition! fie on myself; that have a sword, and yet\r\n     am ready to famish! These five days have I hid me in these woods,\r\n     and durst not peep out, for all the country is laid for me; but now\r\n     am I so hungry, that if I might have a lease of my life for a\r\n     thousand years, I could stay no longer. Wherefore, on a brick-wall\r\n     have I climbed into this garden, to see if I can eat grass, or pick\r\n     a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach\r\n     this hot weather. And, I think, this word sallet was born to do me\r\n     good: for, many a time, but for a sallet, my brain-pan had been\r\n     cleft with a brown bill; and, many a time, when I have been dry,\r\n     and bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a quart-pot to\r\n     drink in; and now the word sallet must serve me to feed on.\r\n\r\n     _Enter_ IDEN, _with Servants, behind._\r\n\r\n     _Iden._ Lord! who would live turmoiléd in the court,\r\n             And may enjoy such quiet walks as these!\r\n             This small inheritance, my father left me,\r\n             Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.\r\n             I seek not to wax great by others' waning;\r\n             Or gather wealth I care not with what envy:\r\n             Sufficeth that I have maintains my state,\r\n             And sends the poor well pleaséd from my gate.\r\n\r\n     _Cade._ Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray,\r\n     for entering his fee-simple without leave. Ah, villain, thou wilt\r\n     betray me, and get a thousand crowns of the king by carrying my\r\n     head to him; but I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and\r\n     swallow my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part.\r\n\r\n     _Iden._ Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,\r\n             I know thee not; why then should I betray thee?\r\n             Is't not enough, to break into my garden,\r\n             And like a thief to come to rob my grounds,\r\n             Climbing my walls in spite of me, the owner,\r\n             But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?\r\n\r\n     _Cade._ Brave thee? ay, by the best blood that ever was broached,\r\n     and beard thee too. Look on me well: I have eat no meat these five\r\n     days; yet, come thou and thy five men; and if I do not leave you\r\n     all as dead as a door-nail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.\r\n\r\n     _Iden._ Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,\r\n             That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,\r\n             Took odds to combat a poor famished man.\r\n             Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,\r\n             See if thou canst outface me with thy looks:\r\n             Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;\r\n             Thy hand is but a finger to my fist;\r\n             Thy leg a stick, comparéd with this truncheon;\r\n             My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;\r\n             And if mine arm be heavéd in the air,\r\n             Thy grave is digged already in the earth.\r\n             As for words, whose greatness answers words,\r\n             Let this my sword report what speech forbears.\r\n\r\n     _Cade._ By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I\r\n     heard.--Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out the\r\n     burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath, I\r\n     beseech Jove on my knees, thou mayest be turned to hobnails. [_They\r\n     fight._ CADE _falls_.] O! I am slain. Famine, and no other, hath\r\n     slain me: let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me but\r\n     the ten meals I have lost, and I'd defy them all. Wither, garden;\r\n     and be henceforth a burying-place to all that do dwell in this\r\n     house, because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.\r\n\r\n     _Iden._ Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?\r\n             Sword, I will hallow thee for this thy deed,\r\n             And hang thee o'er my tomb, when I am dead:\r\n             Ne'er shall this blood be wipéd from thy point,\r\n             But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat,\r\n             To emblaze the honour that thy master got.\r\n\r\n     _Cade._ Iden, farewell; and be proud of thy victory. Tell Kent from\r\n     me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort all the world to be\r\n     cowards; for I, that never feared any, am vanquished by famine, not\r\n     by valour.\r\n                                                                [_Dies._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE DEATH OF CADE]\r\n\r\nThat was on July 12, 1450. Cade did not die at once, but on the way to\r\nLondon, whither he was conveyed in a cart. On the 16th his body was\r\ndrawn and quartered and dragged through London on a hurdle. One quarter\r\nwas then sent to Blackheath; the other three to Norwich, Gloucester and\r\nSalisbury. Cade's head was set up on London Bridge. Iden was knighted. A\r\npillar was erected at Cade Street by Newbery on the piece of land that\r\nhe possessed nearest to the probable scene of the event. \"Near this spot\r\nwas slain the notorious rebel Jack Cade, by Alexander Iden, Esq.,\" is\r\nthe inscription.\r\n\r\nSlaughter Common, near Heathfield, is said to be the scene of a more\r\nwholesale carnage, Heathfield people claiming that there Caedwalla in\r\n635 fought the Saxons and killed Eadwine, king of Northumbria. Sylvan\r\nHarmer, in his manuscript history of Heathfield, is determined that\r\nHeathfield shall have the credit of the fray, but, as a matter of fact,\r\nif Slaughter Common really took its name from a battle it was a very\r\ndifferent one, for Caedwalla and Eadwine met, not at Heathfield, but\r\nHatfield Chase, near Doncaster.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HEFFUL CUCKOO FAIR]\r\n\r\nIt is at Hefful Cuckoo fair on April 14--Hefful being Sussex for\r\nHeathfield--that, tradition states, the old woman lets the cuckoo out of\r\nher basket and starts him on his course through the summer months. A\r\nlocal story tells of a Heathfield man who had a quarrel with his wife\r\nand left for Ditchling. After some days he returned, remarking, \"I've\r\nhad enough of furrin parts--nothing like old England yet.\"\r\n\r\nIf any one, walking from Heathfield towards Burwash, is astonished to\r\nfind a \"Railway Inn,\" let him spend no time in seeking a station, for\r\nthere is none within some miles. This inn was once \"The Labour in Vain,\"\r\nwith a signboard representing two men hard at work scrubbing a nigger\r\ntill the white should gleam through. Then came a scheme to run a line to\r\nEastbourne, midway between the present Heathfield line and the Burwash\r\nline, and enterprise dictated the changing of the sign to one more in\r\nkeeping with the times. The railway project was abandoned but the inn\r\nretains its new style.\r\n\r\nWarbleton, a village in the iron country, two miles south of Heathfield,\r\nis famous for its association with Richard Woodman, the Sussex martyr,\r\nwho is mentioned in an earlier chapter. His house and foundry were hard\r\nby the churchyard. The wonderful door in the church tower, a miracle of\r\nintricate bolts and massive strength, has been attributed to Woodman's\r\nmechanical skill; and the theory has been put forward that he made this\r\ndoor for his own strong room, and it was afterwards moved to the church.\r\nAnother story says that he was imprisoned in the church tower before\r\nbeing taken for trial. Warbleton has the following terse and confident\r\nepitaph upon Ann North, wife of the vicar, who died in 1780:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Through death's rough waves her bark serenely trod,\r\n     Her pilot Jesus, and her harbour God.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Horeham Road station, next Heathfield on the way to Hailsham, we\r\ncan walk across the country to East Hoathly, and thence to Chiddingly\r\nand Hellingly, where we come to the railway again. (\"East Hoathly,\r\nChiddingly and Hellingly,\" says a local witticism: \"three lies and all\r\ntrue.\") East Hoathly stands high in not very interesting country, nor is\r\nit now a very interesting village. But it is remarkable for an admirably\r\nconducted inn and a church unique (in my experience of old churches) in\r\nits interior for a prettiness that is little short of aggressive.\r\nWhatever paint and mosaic can do to remove plain white surfaces has been\r\ndone here, and the windows are gay with new glass. Were the building a\r\nnew one, say at Surbiton, the effect would be harmonious; but in an old\r\nvillage in Sussex it seems a mistake.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CHILD-EATER]\r\n\r\nColonel Thomas Lunsford, of Whyly (now no more), near East Hoathly, a\r\ncavalier and friend of Charles I., was notoriously a consumer of the\r\nflesh of babes. How he won such a reputation is not known, but it never\r\nleft him. _Hudibras_ mentions his tastes; in one ballad of the time he\r\nfigures as Lunsford that \"eateth of children,\" and in another, recording\r\nhis supposed death, he is found with \"a child's arm in his pocket.\"\r\nAfter a stormy but courageous career he died in 1691, innocent of\r\ncannibalism. It was this Lunsford who fired at his relative, Sir\r\nNicholas Pelham of Halland, as he was one day entering East Hoathly\r\nchurch. The huge bullet, the outcome of a long feud, missed Nicholas and\r\nlodged in the church door, where it remained for many years. It cost\r\nLunsford _£_8,000 and outlawry.\r\n\r\nHalland, one of the seats of the Pelhams, about a mile from the\r\nvillage, was just above Terrible Down, a tract of wild land, on which,\r\naccording to local tradition, a battle was once fought so fiercely that\r\nthe soldiers were up to their knees in blood. In the neighbourhood it\r\nis, of course, called Tarble Down. Local tradition also states of a\r\ncertain piece of woodland attached to the glebe of this parish, called\r\nBreeches Wood, that it owes its name to the circumstance that an East\r\nHoathly lady, noticing the vicar's breeches to be in need of mending,\r\npresented to him and his successors the wood in question as an endowment\r\nto ensure the perpetual repair of those garments.\r\n\r\nHalland House no longer exists, but in the days of the great Duke of\r\nNewcastle, who died in 1768, it was famous for its hospitality and\r\nsplendour. We meet with traces of its influence in the frequent\r\ninebriation, after visits there, of Mr. Thomas Turner, a mercer and\r\ngeneral dealer of East Hoathly, who kept a diary from 1764, recording\r\nsome of his lapses and other experiences. A few passages from the\r\nextracts quoted in the Sussex Archæological Collections may be given:\r\n\r\n\"My wife read to me that moving scene of the funeral of Miss Clarissa\r\nHarlow. Oh, may the Supreme Being give me grace to lead my life in such\r\na manner as my exit may in some measure be like that divine creature's.\r\n\r\n\"This morn my wife and I had words about her going to Lewes to-morrow.\r\nOh, what happiness must there be in the married state, when there is a\r\nsincere regard on both sides, and each partie truly satisfied with each\r\nother's merits. But it is impossible for tongue or pen to express the\r\nuneasiness that attends the contrary.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, August 28th, 1756, Thos. Davey, at our house in the evening, to\r\nwhom I read five of Tillotson's Sermons.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, October 28th, Thos. Davey came in the evening to whom I read\r\nsix of Tillotson's sermons.\r\n\r\n\"This day went to Mrs. Porter's to inform them the livery lace was not\r\ncome, when I think Mrs. Porter treated me with as much imperious and\r\nscornful usage as if she had been, what I think she is, more of a Turk\r\nand Infidel than a Christian, and I an abject slave.\r\n\r\n\"I went down to Mrs. Porter's and acquainted her that I would not get\r\nher gown before Monday, who received me with all the affability,\r\ncourtesy, and good humour imaginable. Oh! what a pleasure would it be to\r\nserve them was they always in such a temper; it would even induce me,\r\nalmost, to forget to take a just profit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POTATIONS]\r\n\r\n\"We supped at Mr. Fuller's and spent the evening with a great deal of\r\nmirth, till between one and two. Tho. Fuller brought my wife home upon\r\nhis back. I cannot say I came home sober, though I was far from being\r\nbad company.\r\n\r\n\"The curate of Laughton came to the shop in the forenoon, and he having\r\nbought some things of me (and I could wish he had paid for them) dined\r\nwith me, and also staid in the afternoon till he got in liquor, and\r\nbeing so complaisant as to keep him company, I was quite drunk. How do I\r\ndetest myself for being so foolish!\r\n\r\n\"In the even, read the twelfth and last book of Milton's _Paradise\r\nLost_, which I have now read twice through.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Banister having lately taken from the smugglers a freight of\r\nbrandy, entertained Mr. Carman, Mr. Fuller, and myself, in the even,\r\nwith a bowl of punch.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the Pelhams owned Halland, their principal seat was at\r\nLaughton, two or three miles to the south. Of that splendid Tudor\r\nmansion little now remains but one brick tower. In the vault of the\r\nchurch, which has been much restored, no fewer than forty Pelhams\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nChiddingly church presents the completest contrast to East Hoathly's\r\nover-decorated yet accessible fane that could be imagined. Its door is\r\nnot only kept shut, but a special form of locked bar seems to have been\r\ninvented for it, and on the day that I was last there the churchyard\r\ngate was padlocked too. The spire of white stone (visible for many\r\nmiles)--a change from the customary oak shingling of Sussex--has been\r\nbound with iron chains that suggest the possibility of imminent\r\ndissolution, while within, the building is gloomy and time-stained. If\r\nat East Hoathly the church gives the impression of a too complacent\r\nprosperity, here we have precisely the reverse. The state of the\r\nJefferay monument behind a row of rude railings is in keeping.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PROUD JEFFERAYS]\r\n\r\nIn the Jefferay monument, by the way, the statues at either side stand\r\non two circular tablets, which are not unlike the yellow cheeses of\r\nAlkmaar. It was possibly this circumstance that led to the myth that the\r\nJefferays, too proud to walk on the ground, had on Sundays a series of\r\ncheeses ranged between their house and the church, on which to step.\r\nTheir house was Chiddingly Place, built by Sir John Jefferay, who died\r\nin 1577. Remains of this great mansion are still to be seen. It was\r\nduring Sir John's time that Chiddingly had a vicar, William Titelton,\r\nsufficiently flexible to retain the living under Henry VIII., Edward\r\nVI., Mary, and Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nHere, in the eighteenth century, lived one William Elphick, a devotee of\r\nbell-ringing, who computed that altogether he had rung Chiddingly's\r\ntriple bell for 8,766 hours (which is six hours more than a year), and\r\nwho travelled upwards of ten thousand miles to ring the bells of other\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nMark Antony Lower, most interesting of the Sussex archæologists, to whom\r\nthese pages have been much indebted, was born at Chiddingly in 1813.\r\n\r\nMr. Egerton in his _Sussex Folk and Sussex Ways_ tells a story of a\r\ncouple down Chiddingly way who agreed upon a very satisfactory system of\r\ndanger signals when things were not quite well with either of them.\r\nWhenever the husband came home a little \"contrary\" he wore his hat on\r\nthe back of his head, and then she never said a word; and if she came in\r\na little cross and crooked she threw her shawl over her left shoulder,\r\nand then he never said a word.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CZAR AND QUAKER]\r\n\r\nA little to the east of Hellingly is Amberstone, the scene, in 1814, of\r\na pretty occurrence. Alexander, the Czar of all the Russias, travelling\r\nfrom Brighton to Dover with his sister, the Duchess of Oldenburgh, saw\r\nNathaniel and Mary Rickman of Amberstone standing by their gate. From\r\ntheir dress he knew them to be Quakers, a sect in which he was much\r\ninterested. The carriage was therefore stopped, and the Czar and his\r\nsister entered the house; they were taken all over it, praised its\r\nneatness, ate some lunch, and parted with the kindest expressions of\r\ngoodwill, the Czar shaking hands with the Quaker and the Duchess kissing\r\nthe Quakeress.\r\n\r\nA few minutes on the rail bring us to Hailsham, an old market town,\r\nwhose church, standing on the ridge which borders Pevensey Level on the\r\nwest, is capped with pinnacles like that of East Grinstead. Walking a\r\nfew yards beyond the church one comes to the edge of the high ground,\r\nwith nothing before one but miles and miles of the meadow-land of this\r\nDutch region, green and moist and dotted with cattle.\r\n\r\nHailsham's principal value to the traveller is that it is the station\r\nfor Hurstmonceux; whither, however, we are to journey by another route.\r\nOtherwise the town exists principally in order that bullocks and sheep\r\nmay change hands once a week. Hailsham's cattle market covers three\r\nacres, and on market days the wayfarers in the streets need the agility\r\nof a picador.\r\n\r\nWe ought, however, to see Michelham Priory while we are here. It lies\r\ntwo miles to the west of Hailsham, in the Cuckmere valley--now a\r\nbeautifully-placed farmhouse, but once a house of Augustinian Canons\r\nfounded in the reign of Henry III. Here one may see the old monkish fish\r\nstews, so useful on Fridays, in perfection. The moat, where fish were\r\nprobably also caught, is still as it was, and the fine old\r\nthree-storied gateway and the mill belonging to the monks stand to this\r\nday. The priory, although much in ruins, is very interesting, and well\r\nworth seeing and exploring with a reconstructive eye.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE TWO DICKERS]\r\n\r\nA little further west is the Dicker--or rather the two Dickers, Upper\r\nDicker and Lower Dicker, large commons between Arlington in the south\r\nand Chiddingly in the north. Here are some of the many pottery works for\r\nwhich Sussex is famous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Beachy Head._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nEASTBOURNE\r\n\r\n     Select Eastbourne. The \"English Salvator Rosa\"--Sops and Ale--Beau\r\n     Chef--\"The Breeze on Beachy Head\"--Shakespeare and the Cliff--\"To a\r\n     Seamew\"--The new lighthouse--Parson Darby and his cave--East Dean's\r\n     bells--The Two Sisters--Friston's Selwyn monument--West Dean.\r\n\r\n\r\nEastbourne is the most select, or least democratic, of the Sussex\r\nwatering places. Fashion does not resort thither as to Brighton in the\r\nseason, but the crowds of excursionists that pour into Brighton and\r\nHastings are comparatively unknown at Eastbourne; which is in a sense a\r\nprivate settlement, under the patronage of the Duke of Devonshire.\r\nHastings is of the people; Brighton has a character almost continental;\r\nEastbourne is select. Lawn tennis and golf are its staple products, one\r\nplayed on the very beautiful links behind the town hard by Compton\r\nPlace, the residence of the Duke; the other in Devonshire Park. It is\r\nalso an admirable town for horsemanship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ENGLISH SALVATOR ROSA]\r\n\r\nEastbourne has had small share in public affairs, but in 1741 John\r\nHamilton Mortimer, the painter, sometimes called the Salvator Rosa of\r\nEngland, was born there. From a memoir of him which Horsfield prints, I\r\ntake passages: \"Bred on the sea-coast, and amid a daring and rugged race\r\nof hereditary smugglers, it had pleased his young imagination to walk on\r\nthe shore when the sea was agitated by storms--to seek out the most\r\nsequestered places among the woods and rocks, and frequently, and not\r\nwithout danger, to witness the intrepidity of the contraband\r\nadventurers, who, in spite of storms and armed excisemen, pursued their\r\nprecarious trade at all hazards. In this way he had, from boyhood,\r\nbecome familiar with what amateurs of art call 'Salvator Rosa-looking\r\nscenes'; he loved to depict the sea chafing and foaming, and fit 'to\r\nswallow navigation up'--ships in peril, and pinnaces sinking--banditti\r\nplundering, or reposing in caverns--and all such situations as are\r\nfamiliar to pirates on water, and outlaws on land....\r\n\r\n\"Of his eccentricities while labouring under the delusion that he could\r\nnot well be a genius without being unsober and wild, one specimen may\r\nsuffice. He was employed by Lord Melbourne to paint a ceiling at his\r\nseat of Brocket Hall, Herts; and taking advantage of permission to angle\r\nin the fish-pond, he rose from a carousal at midnight, and seeking a\r\nnet, and calling on an assistant painter for help, dragged the preserve,\r\nand left the whole fish gasping on the bank in rows. Nor was this the\r\nworst; when reproved mildly, and with smiles, by Lady Melbourne, he had\r\nthe audacity to declare, that her beauty had so bewitched him that he\r\nknew not what he was about. To plunder the fish-pond and be impertinent\r\nto the lady was not the way to obtain patronage. The impudent painter\r\ncollected his pencils together, and returned to London to enjoy his\r\ninelegant pleasures and ignoble company.\"\r\n\r\nHorsfield states that \"a custom far more honoured by the breach than the\r\nobservance heretofore existed in the manor of Eastbourne; in compliance\r\nwith which, after any lady, or respectable farmer or tradesman's wife,\r\nwas delivered of a child, certain quantities of food and of beer were\r\nplaced in a room adjacent to the sacred edifice; when, after the second\r\nlesson was concluded, the whole agricultural portion of the worshippers\r\nmarched out of church, and devoured what was prepared for them. This was\r\ncalled _Sops and Ale_.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EASTBOURNE RUG]\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor the water Poet, whom we saw, at Goring, the prey of fleas\r\nand the Law, made another journey into the county between August 9th and\r\nSeptember 3rd, 1653, and as was usual with him wrote about it in\r\ndoggerel verse. At Eastbourne he found a brew called Eastbourne Rug:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     No cold can ever pierce his flesh or skin\r\n     Of him who is well lin'd with Rug within;\r\n     Rug is a lord beyond the Rules of Law,\r\n     It conquers hunger in a greedy maw,\r\n     And, in a word, of all drinks potable,\r\n     Rug is most puissant, potent, notable.\r\n     Rug was the Capital Commander there,\r\n     And his Lieutenant-General was strong beer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPossibly it was in order to contest the supremacy of Rug (which one may\r\nask for in Eastbourne to-day in vain) that Newhaven Tipper sprang into\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nThe Martello towers, which Pitt built during the Napoleonic scare at the\r\nbeginning of last century, begin at Eastbourne, where the cliffs cease,\r\nand continue along the coast into Kent. They were erected probably quite\r\nas much to assist in allaying public fear by a tangible and visible\r\nsymbol of defence as from any idea that they would be a real service in\r\nthe event of invasion. Many of them have now disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEACHY HEAD]\r\n\r\nEastbourne's glory is Beachy Head, the last of the Downs, which stop\r\ndead at the town and never reappear in Sussex again. The range takes a\r\nsudden turn to the south at Folkington, whence it rolls straight for\r\nthe sea, Beachy Head being the ultimate eminence. (The name Beachy has,\r\nby the way, nothing to do with the beach: it is derived probably from\r\nthe Normans' description--\"beau chef.\") About Beachy Head one has the\r\nSouth Downs in perfection: the best turf, the best prospect, the best\r\nloneliness, and the best air. Richard Jefferies, in his fine essay, \"The\r\nBreeze on Beachy Head,\" has a rapturous word to say of this air (poor\r\nJefferies, destined to do so much for the health of others and so little\r\nfor his own!).--\"But the glory of these glorious Downs is the breeze.\r\nThe air in the valleys immediately beneath them is pure and pleasant;\r\nbut the least climb, even a hundred feet, puts you on a plane with the\r\natmosphere itself, uninterrupted by so much as the tree-tops. It is air\r\nwithout admixture. If it comes from the south, the waves refine it; if\r\ninland, the wheat and flowers and grass distil it. The great headland\r\nand the whole rib of the promontory is wind-swept and washed with air;\r\nthe billows of the atmosphere roll over it.\r\n\r\n\"The sun searches out every crevice amongst the grass, nor is there the\r\nsmallest fragment of surface which is not sweetened by air and light.\r\nUnderneath the chalk itself is pure, and the turf thus washed by wind\r\nand rain, sun-dried and dew-scented, is a couch prepared with thyme to\r\nrest on. Discover some excuse to be up there always, to search for stray\r\nmushrooms--they will be stray, for the crop is gathered extremely early\r\nin the morning--or to make a list of flowers and grasses; to do\r\nanything, and, if not, go always without any pretext. Lands of gold have\r\nbeen found, and lands of spices and precious merchandise: but this is\r\nthe land of health.\"\r\n\r\nSeated near the edge of the cliff one realises, as it is possible\r\nnowhere else to realise, except perhaps at Dover, the truth of Edgar's\r\ndescription of the headland in _King Lear_. It seems difficult to think\r\nof Shakespeare exploring these or any Downs, and yet the scene must have\r\nbeen in his own experience; nothing but actual sight could have given\r\nhim the line about the crows and choughs:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Come on, sir; here's the place:--stand still.--How fearful\r\n     And dizzy 't is, to cast one's eyes so low!\r\n     The crows and choughs, that wing the midway air,\r\n     Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down\r\n     Hangs one that gathers samphire--dreadful trade!\r\n     Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:\r\n     The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,\r\n     Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,\r\n     Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy\r\n     Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,\r\n     That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,\r\n     Cannot be heard so high.--I'll look no more,\r\n     Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight\r\n     Topple down headlong.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"TO A SEAMEW\"]\r\n\r\nChoughs are rare at Beachy Head, but jackdaws and gulls are in great and\r\nnoisy profusion; and this reminds me that it was on Beachy Head in\r\nSeptember, 1886, that the inspiration of one of the most beautiful\r\nbird-poems in our language came to its author--the ode \"To a Seamew\" of\r\nMr. Swinburne. I quote five of its haunting stanzas:\r\n\r\n\r\n     We, sons and sires of seamen,\r\n       Whose home is all the sea,\r\n     What place man may, we claim it;\r\n     But thine----whose thought may name it?\r\n     Free birds live higher than freemen,\r\n       And gladlier ye than we----\r\n     We, sons and sires of seamen,\r\n       Whose home is all the sea.\r\n\r\n     For you the storm sounds only\r\n       More notes of more delight\r\n     Than earth's in sunniest weather:\r\n     When heaven and sea together\r\n     Join strengths against the lonely\r\n       Lost bark borne down by night,\r\n     For you the storm sounds only\r\n       More notes of more delight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The lark knows no such rapture,\r\n       Such joy no nightingale,\r\n     As sways the songless measure,\r\n     Wherein thy wings take pleasure:\r\n     Thy love may no man capture,\r\n       Thy pride may no man quail;\r\n     The lark knows no such rapture,\r\n       Such joy no nightingale.\r\n\r\n     And we, whom dreams embolden,\r\n       We can but creep and sing\r\n     And watch through heaven's waste hollow\r\n     The flight no sight may follow\r\n     To the utter bourne beholden\r\n       Of none that lack thy wing:\r\n     And we, whom dreams embolden,\r\n       We can but creep and sing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Ah, well were I for ever,\r\n      Wouldst thou change lives with me,\r\n     And take my song's wild honey,\r\n     And give me back thy sunny\r\n     Wide eyes that weary never,\r\n       And wings that search the sea;\r\n     Ah, well were I for ever,\r\n       Wouldst thou change lives with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PARSON DARBY]\r\n\r\nThe old lighthouse on Beachy Head, the Belle Tout, which first flung its\r\nbeams abroad in 1831, has just been superseded by the new lighthouse\r\nbuilt on the shore under the cliff. Near the new lighthouse is Parson\r\nDarby's Hole--a cavern in the cliff said to have been hewed out by the\r\nRev. Jonathan Darby of East Dean as a refuge from the tongue of Mrs.\r\nDarby. Another account credits the parson with the wish to provide a\r\nsanctuary for shipwrecked sailors, whom he guided thither on stormy\r\nnights by torches. In a recent Sussex story by Mr. Horace Hutchinson,\r\ncalled _A Friend of Nelson_, we find the cave in the hands of a powerful\r\nsmuggler, mysterious and accomplished as Lavengro, some years after\r\nDarby's death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: UNDER BEACHY HEAD]\r\n\r\nA pleasant walk from Eastbourne is to Birling Gap, a great smuggling\r\ncentre in the old days, where the Downs dip for a moment to the level of\r\nthe sea. Here at low tide one may walk under the cliffs. Richard\r\nJefferies, in the essay from which I have already quoted, has a\r\nbeautiful passage of reflections beneath the great bluff:--\"The sea\r\nseems higher than the spot where I stand, its surface on a higher\r\nlevel--raised like a green mound--as if it could burst in and occupy the\r\nspace up to the foot of the cliff in a moment. It will not do so, I\r\nknow; but there is an infinite possibility about the sea; it may do what\r\nit is not recorded to have done. It is not to be ordered, it may\r\noverleap the bounds human observation has fixed for it. It has a potency\r\nunfathomable. There is still something in it not quite grasped and\r\nunderstood--something still to be discovered--a mystery.\r\n\r\n\"So the white spray rushes along the low broken wall of rocks, the sun\r\ngleams on the flying fragments of the wave, again it sinks, and the\r\nrhythmic motion holds the mind, as an invisible force holds back the\r\ntide. A faith of expectancy, a sense that something may drift up from\r\nthe unknown, a large belief in the unseen resources of the endless space\r\nout yonder, soothes the mind with dreamy hope.\r\n\r\n\"The little rules and little experiences, all the petty ways of narrow\r\nlife, are shut off behind by the ponderous and impassable cliff; as if\r\nwe had dwelt in the dim light of a cave, but coming out at last to look\r\nat the sun, a great stone had fallen and closed the entrance, so that\r\nthere was no return to the shadow. The impassable precipice shuts off\r\nour former selves of yesterday, forcing us to look out over the sea\r\nonly, or up to the deeper heaven.\r\n\r\n\"These breadths draw out the soul; we feel that we have wider thoughts\r\nthan we knew; the soul has been living, as it were, in a nutshell, all\r\nunaware of its own power, and now suddenly finds freedom in the sun and\r\nthe sky. Straight, as if sawn down from turf to beach, the cliff shuts\r\noff the human world, for the sea knows no time and no era; you cannot\r\ntell what century it is from the face of the sea. A Roman trireme\r\nsuddenly rounding the white edge-line of chalk, borne on wind and oar\r\nfrom the Isle of Wight towards the gray castle at Pevensey (already old\r\nin olden days), would not seem strange. What wonder could surprise us\r\ncoming from the wonderful sea?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Beachy Head from the Shore._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EAST DEAN]\r\n\r\nThe road from Birling Gap runs up the valley to East Dean and Friston,\r\ntwo villages among the Downs. Parson Darby's church at East Dean is\r\nsmall and not particularly interesting; but it gave Horsfield, the\r\ncounty historian, the opportunity to make one of his infrequent jokes.\r\n\"There are three bells,\" he writes, \"and 'if discord's harmony not\r\nunderstood,' truly harmonious ones.\" Horsfield does not note that one of\r\nthese three bells bore a Latin motto which being translated signifies\r\n\r\n\r\n     Surely no bell beneath the sky\r\n     Can send forth better sounds than I?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe East Dean register contains a curious entry which is quoted in\r\nGrose's _Olio_, ed. 1796:--\"Agnes Payne, the daughter of Edward Payne,\r\nwas buried on the _first day of February_. Johan Payne, the daughter of\r\nEdward Payne, was buried on the _first day of February_.\r\n\r\n\"In the death of these two sisters last mentioned is one thing worth\r\nrecording, and diligently to be noted. 'The elder sister, called Agnes,\r\nbeing very sicke unto death, _speechless_, and, as was thought, past\r\nhope of speakinge; after she had lyen twenty-four hours without speach,\r\nat last upon a suddayne cryed out to her sister to make herself ready\r\nand to come with her.

The family commemorated is the Selwyns, and the monument has\r\na very charming dado of six kneeling daughters and three babies laid\r\nneatly on a tasseled cushion, under the reading desk--a quaint conceit\r\nimpossible to be carried out successfully in these days, but pretty and\r\nfitting enough then. Of the last of the Selwyns, \"Ultimus Selwynorum,\"\r\nwho died aged twenty, in 1704, it is said, with that exquisite\r\nsimplicity of exaggeration of which the secret also has been lost, that\r\nfor him \"the very marble might weep.\" Friston Place, the home of the\r\nSelwyns, has some noble timbers, and a curious old donkey-well in the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nWest Dean, which is three miles to the west, by a bleak and lonely road\r\namid hills and valleys, is just a farm yard, with remains of very\r\nancient architecture among the barns and ricks. The village, however, is\r\nmore easily reached from Alfriston than Eastbourne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nPEVENSEY AND HURSTMONCEUX\r\n\r\n    A well-behaved castle--Rail and romance--Britons, Romans, Saxons and\r\n    Normans at Pevensey--William the Conqueror--A series of sieges--The\r\n    first English letter--Andrew Borde, the jester, again--Pevensey\r\n    gibes--A red brick castle--Hurstmonceux church--The tomb of the\r\n    Dacres.--Two Hurstmonceux clerics--The de Fiennes and the de\r\n    Monceux--A spacious home--The ghost--The unfortunate Lord\r\n    Dacre--Horace Walpole at Hurstmonceux--The trug industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nPevensey Castle behaves as a castle should: it rises from the plain, the\r\nonly considerable eminence for miles; it has noble grey walls of the\r\ntrue romantic hue and thickness; it can be seen from the sea, over which\r\nit once kept guard; it has a history rich in assailants and defenders.\r\nThere is indeed nothing in its disfavour except the proximity of the\r\nrailway, which has been allowed to pass nearer the ruin than dramatic\r\nfitness would dictate. Let it, however, be remembered that the railway\r\nthrough the St. Pancras Priory at Lewes led to the discovery of the\r\ncoffins of William de Warenne and Gundrada, and also that, in Mr.\r\nKipling's phrase, romance, so far from being at enmity with the iron\r\nhorse, \"brought up the 9.15.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pevensey Castle._]\r\n\r\nPevensey, which is now divided from the channel by marshy fields with\r\nnothing to break the flatness but Martello towers (thirteen may be\r\ncounted from the walls), was, like Bramber Castle in the west, now also\r\nan inland stronghold, once washed and surrounded by the sea. The sea\r\nprobably covered all the ground as far inland as Hailsham--Pevensey,\r\nHorseye, Rickney and the other \"eyes\" on the level, being then\r\nislands, as their termination suggests.\r\n\r\nThere is now no doubt but that Pevensey was the Anderida of the Romans,\r\na city on the borders of the great forest of Anderida that covered the\r\nWeald of Sussex--Andreas Weald as it was called by the Saxons. But\r\nbefore the Romans a British stronghold existed here. This, after the\r\nRomans left, was attacked by the Saxons, who slew every Briton that they\r\nfound therein. The Saxons in their turn being discomfited, the Normans\r\nbuilt a new castle within the old walls, with Robert de Moreton, half\r\nbrother of the Conqueror, for its lord. Thus the castle as it now stands\r\nis in its outer walls Roman, in its inner, Norman.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WILLIAM'S LANDING]\r\n\r\nUnlike certain other Sussex fortresses, Pevensey has seen work. Of its\r\nRoman career we know nothing, except that the inhabitants seem to have\r\ndropped a large number of coins, many of which have been dug up. The\r\nSaxons, as we have seen, massacred the Britons at Anderida very\r\nthoroughly. Later, in 1042, Swane, son of Earl Godwin, swooped on\r\nPevensey's port in the Danish manner and carried off a number of ships.\r\nIn 1049 Earl Godwin, and another son, Harold, made a second foray,\r\ncarried off more ships, and fired the town. On September 28, 1066,\r\nPevensey saw a more momentous landing, destined to be fatal to this\r\nmarauding Harold; for on that day William, Duke of Normandy, soon to\r\nbecome William the Conqueror, alighted from his vessel, accompanied by\r\nseveral hundred Frenchmen in black chain armour. A representation of the\r\nlanding is one of the designs in the Bayeux tapestry. The embroiderers\r\ntake no count of William's fall as he stepped ashore, on ground now\r\ngrazed upon by cattle, an accident deemed unlucky until his ready wit\r\nexplained, as he rose with sanded fingers, \"See, I have seized the land\r\nwith my hands.\"\r\n\r\nPevensey's later history included sieges by William Rufus in 1088, when\r\nOdo, Bishop of Bayeux, supporter of Robert, was the defender; by\r\nStephen in 1144, the fortress being held by Maude, who gave in\r\neventually to famine; by Simon de Montfort and the Barons in 1265; and\r\nby the supporters of Richard of York in 1399, when Lady Pelham defended\r\nit for the Rose of Lancaster. A little later Edmund, Duke of York, was\r\nimprisoned in it, and was so satisfied with his gaoler that he\r\nbequeathed him _£_20. Queen Joan of Navarre, wife of Henry IV., was also a\r\nprisoner here for nine years. In the year before the Armada, Pevensey\r\nCastle was ordered to be either rebuilt as a fortress or razed to the\r\nground; but fortunately neither instruction was carried out.\r\n\r\nThe present owner of Pevensey Castle is the Duke of Devonshire, who by\r\nvirtue of the possession is entitled to call himself Dominus Aquilæ, or\r\nLord of the Eagle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LETTER-WRITING]\r\n\r\nPevensey has another and gentler claim to notice. Many essayists have\r\nsaid pleasant and ingenious things about the art of letter-writing; but\r\nnone of them mentions the part played by Pevensey in the English\r\ndevelopment of that agreeable accomplishment. Yet the earliest specimen\r\nof English letter-writing that exists was penned in Pevensey Castle. The\r\nwriter was Joan Crownall, Lady Pelham, wife of Sir John Pelham, who, as\r\nI have said, defended the castle, in her Lord's absence, against the\r\nYorkists, and this is the letter, penned (I write in 1903) five hundred\r\nand four years ago. (It has no postscript.)\r\n\r\n\r\n     My dear Lord,--I recommend me to your high Lordship, with heart and\r\n     body and all my poor might. And with all this I thank you as my\r\n     dear Lord, dearest and best beloved of all earthly lords. I say for\r\n     me, and thank you, my dear Lord, with all this that I said before\r\n     of [for] your comfortable letter that you sent me from Pontefract,\r\n     that came to me on Mary Magdalen's day: for by my troth I was never\r\n     so glad as when I heard by your letter that ye were strong enough\r\n     with the grace of God for to keep you from the malice of your\r\n     enemies. And, dear Lord, if it like to your high Lordship that as\r\n     soon as ye might that I might hear of your gracious speed, which\r\n     God Almighty continue and increase. And, my dear Lord, if it like\r\n     you to know _my_ fare, I am here laid by in manner of a siege with\r\n     the county of Sussex, Surrey, and a great parcel of Kent, so that\r\n     I may not [go] out nor no victuals get me, but with much hard.\r\n     Wherefore, my dear, if it like you by the advice of your wise\r\n     counsel for to set remedy of the salvation of your Castle and\r\n     withstand the malice of the Shires aforesaid. And also that ye be\r\n     fully informed of the great malice-workers in these shires which\r\n     have so despitefully wrought to you, and to your Castle, to your\r\n     men and to your tenants; for this country have they wasted for a\r\n     great while.\r\n\r\n     \"Farewell, my dear Lord! the Holy Trinity keep you from your\r\n     enemies, and soon send me good tidings of you.

PELHAM.\"\r\n     \"To my true Lord.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANDREW BORDE AGAIN]\r\n\r\nIn the town of Pevensey once lived Andrew Borde (who entered this world\r\nat Cuckfield): a thorn in the side of municipal dignity. The Dogberryish\r\ndictum \"I am still but a man, although Mayor of Pevensey,\" remains a\r\nlocal joke, and tradition has kept alive the prowess of the Pevensey\r\njury which brought a verdict of manslaughter against one who was charged\r\nwith stealing breeches; both jokes of Andrew's. Borde's house, whither,\r\nit is said, Edward VI. once came on a visit to the jester, still stands.\r\nThe oak room in which Andrew welcomed the youthful king is shown at a\r\ncost of threepence per head, and you may buy pictorial postcards and\r\nGerman wooden toys in the wit's front parlour.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Pevensey I must say a word of Westham, the village which\r\nadjoins it. Westham and Pevensey are practically one, the castle\r\nintervening. Westham has a vicar whose interest in his office might well\r\nbe imitated by some of the other vicars of the county. His noble church,\r\none of the finest in Sussex, with a tower of superb strength and\r\ndignity, is kept open, and just within is a table on which are a number\r\nof copies of a little penny history of Westham which he has prepared,\r\nand for the payment of which he is so eccentric as to trust to the\r\nstranger's honesty.\r\n\r\nThe tower, which the vicar tells us is six hundred years old, he asks us\r\nto admire for its \"utter carelessness and scorn of smoothness and\r\nfinish, or any of the tricks of modern buildings.\" Westham church was\r\none of the first that the Conqueror built, and remains of the original\r\nNorman structure are still serviceable. The vicar suggests that it may\r\nvery possibly have stood a siege. In the jamb of the south door of the\r\nNorman wall is a sundial, without which, one might say, no church is\r\ncompletely perfect. In the tower dwell unmolested a colony of owls, six\r\nof whom once attended a \"reading-in\" service and, seated side by side on\r\na beam, listened with unwavering attention to the Thirty-Nine Articles.\r\nThey were absent on my visit, but a small starling, swift and elusive as\r\na spirit, flitted hither and thither quite happily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Westham._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALES CRESSEL]\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard is the grave of one Ales Cressel (oddest of names),\r\nand among the epitaphs is this upon a Mr. Henty:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Learn from this mistic sage to live or die.\r\n     Well did he love at evening's social hour\r\n     The Sacred Volume's treasure to apply.\r\n\r\n     The remembrance of his excellent character alone reconciles his\r\n     afflicted widow to her irreparable loss.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe church contains a memorial to a young gentleman named Fagg who,\r\n\"having lived to adorn Human Nature by his exemplary manners, was\r\nuntimely snatched away, aged 24.\"\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Westham is a large rambling building known as\r\nPriesthaus, which, once a monastery, is now a farm. Many curious relics\r\nof its earlier state have lately been unearthed.\r\n\r\nIn Pevensey church, which has none of the interest of Westham, a little\r\ncollection of curiosities relating to Pevensey--a constable's staff, old\r\ntitle deeds, seals, and so forth--is kept, in a glass case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hurstmonceux Castle._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HURSTMONCEUX CASTLE]\r\n\r\nIf Pevensey is all that a castle ought to be, in shape, colour, position\r\nand past, Hurstmonceux is the reverse; for it lies low, it has no\r\nswelling contours, it is of red brick instead of grey stone, and never a\r\nfight has it seen. But any disappointment we may feel is the fault not\r\nof Hurstmonceux but of those who named it castle. Were it called\r\nHurstmonceux House, or Place, or Manor, or Grange, all would be well. It\r\nis this use of the word castle (which in Sussex has a connotation\r\nexcluding red brick) that has done Hurstmonceux an injustice, for it is\r\na very imposing and satisfactory ruin, quite as interesting\r\narchitecturally as Pevensey, or, indeed, any of the ruins that we have\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nHurstmonceux Castle stands on the very edge of Pevensey Level, the only\r\nconsiderable structure between Pevensey and the main land proper. In the\r\nintervening miles there are fields and fields, through which the Old\r\nHaven runs, plaintive plovers above them bemoaning their lot, and brown\r\ncows tugging at the rich grass. On the first hillock to the right of the\r\ncastle as one fronts the south, rising like an island from this sea of\r\npasturage, is Hurstmonceux church, whose shingled spire shoots into the\r\nsky, a beacon to travellers in the Level. It is a pretty church with an\r\nexterior of severe simplicity. Between the chancel and the chantry is\r\nthe large tomb covering the remains of Thomas Fiennes, second Lord\r\nDacre of Hurstmonceux, who died in 1534, and Sir Thomas Dacre his son,\r\nsurmounted by life-size stone figures, each in full armour, with hands\r\nproudly raised, and each resting his feet against the Fiennes wolf-dog.\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard is the grave of Julius Hare, once vicar of\r\nHurstmonceux, and the author, with his brother Augustus, of _Guesses at\r\nTruth_. Carlyle's John Sterling was Julius Hare's first curate here.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE OLD SPACIOUSNESS]\r\n\r\nHurstmonceux Castle was once the largest and handsomest of all the\r\ncommoners' houses in the county. Sir Roger de Fiennes, a descendant of\r\nthe John de Fiennes who married Maude, last of the de Monceux, in the\r\nreign of Edward II., built it in 1440. Though the Manor house of the de\r\nMonceux, on the site of the present castle, lacked the imposing\r\nqualities of Roger de Fiennes' stronghold, it was hospitable, spacious,\r\nand luxurious. Edward the First spent a night there in 1302. One of the\r\nde Monceux was on the side of de Montfort in the Battle of Lewes, and\r\nthe first of them to settle in England married Edith, daughter of\r\nWilliam de Warenne and Gundrada, of Lewes Castle.\r\n\r\nHow thorough and conscientious were the workmen employed by Roger de\r\nFiennes, and how sound were their bricks and mortar, may be learned by\r\nthe study of Hurstmonceux Castle to-day. In many parts the walls are\r\nabsolutely uninjured except by tourists. The floors, however, have long\r\nsince returned to nature, who has put forth her energies without stint\r\nto clothe the old apartments with greenery. Ivy of astonishing vigour\r\ngrows here, populous with jackdaws, and trees and shrubs spring from the\r\nleast likely spots.\r\n\r\nThe castle in its old completeness was, practically, a little town. From\r\neast to west its walls measured 206-1/2 feet, from north to south,\r\n214-1/4; within them on the ground floor were larders, laundries, a\r\nbrewhouse, a bakehouse, cellars, a dairy, offices, a guard room,\r\npantries, a distillery, a confectionery room, a chapel, and, beneath, a\r\ndungeon. Between these were four open courts. Upstairs, round three\r\nsides of the Green Court, were the Bird Gallery, the Armour Gallery, and\r\nthe Green Gallery, and lords' apartments and ladies' apartments \"capable\r\nof quartering an army,\" to quote a writer on the subject. On each side\r\nof the entrance, gained by a drawbridge, was a tower--the Watch Tower\r\nand the Signal Tower.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Elizabeth a survey of Hurstmonceux was taken, which\r\ntells us that in the park were two hundred deer, \"four fair ponds\"\r\nstocked with carp and tench, a \"fair warren of conies,\" a heronry of 150\r\nnests, and much game. The de Fiennes, or Dacres as they became, had also\r\na private fishery in Pevensey Bay, seen from the Watch Tower as a strip\r\nof blue ribbon.\r\n\r\nIn addition Hurstmonceux had a ghost, who inhabited the Drummers' Hall,\r\na room between the towers over the porter's lodge, and sent forth a\r\nmysterious tattoo. Sometimes he left his hall, this devilish musician,\r\nand strode along the battlements drumming and drumming, a terrible\r\nfigure nine feet high. Most people were frightened, but there were those\r\nwho said that the drummer was nothing more nor less than a gardener in\r\nleague with the Pevensey smugglers, whose notes, rattled out on the\r\nparchment, rolled over the marsh and gave them the needful signal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE UNFORTUNATE LORD DACRE]\r\n\r\nHurstmonceux once had a very real tragedy. The third Lord Dacre, one of\r\nthe young noblemen who took part in the welcoming of Ann of Cleves when\r\nshe landed in England preparatory to her becoming the wife of Henry\r\nVIII., was so foolish one night in 1541 as to accompany some of his\r\nroystering companions to the adjacent park of Sir Nicholas Pelham, near\r\nHellingly, intent on a deer-stealing jest. There three gamekeepers rose\r\nup, and a bloody battle ensued in which one John Busbrig bit the dust.\r\nPelham was furious and demanded justice, and Lord Dacre, though he had\r\ntaken no part in the fray, was held responsible. Three of his friends\r\nwere hanged at Tyburn, and, in spite of all the influence that was\r\nbrought to bear, he also was executed. The next Dacre of importance\r\nmarried the Lady Ann Fitzroy, a natural daughter of Charles II., and was\r\nmade Earl of Sussex. Financial losses compelling him to sell\r\nHurstmonceux, a lawyer named George Naylor bought it in 1708, leaving\r\nit, on his death, to the Right Rev. Francis Hare, Bishop of Chichester.\r\nIt remained in the family as a residence until, in 1777, an architect\r\npronounced it unsafe, and the interior was converted into materials for\r\nthe new Hurstmonceux Place in the park to the north-west. Since then\r\nnature has had her way with it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WALPOLE AT HURSTMONCEUX]\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole's visit, as described in one of his letters, gives us an\r\nidea of Hurstmonceux in the middle of the eighteenth century, a little\r\nbefore it became derelict:--\"The chapel is small, and mean; the Virgin\r\nand seven long lean saints, ill done, remain in the windows. There have\r\nbeen four more, but they seem to have been removed for light; and we\r\nactually found St. Catherine, and another gentlewoman with a church in\r\nher hand, exiled into the buttery. There remain two odd cavities, with\r\nvery small wooden screens on each side the altar, which seem to have\r\nbeen confessionals. The outside is a mixture of grey brick and stone,\r\nthat has a very venerable appearance. The draw-bridges are romantic to a\r\ndegree; and there is a dungeon, that gives one a delightful idea of\r\nliving in the days of soccage and under such goodly tenures. They showed\r\nus a dismal chamber which they called _Drummer's_-hall, and suppose that\r\nMr. Addison's comedy is descended from it. In the windows of the gallery\r\nover the cloisters, which leads all round to the apartments, is the\r\ndevice of the Fienneses, a wolf holding a baton with a scroll, _Le roy\r\nle veut_--an unlucky motto, as I shall tell you presently, to the last\r\npeer of that line. The estate is two thousand a year, and so compact as\r\nto have but seventeen houses upon it. We walked up a brave old avenue to\r\nthe church, with ships sailing on our left hand the whole way.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TRUGS]\r\n\r\nHurstmonceux is famous not only for its castle, but for its \"trugs,\" the\r\nwooden baskets that gardeners carry, which are associated with\r\nHurstmonceux as crooks once were with Pyecombe, and the shepherds' vast\r\ngreen umbrellas, on cane frames, with Lewes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nHASTINGS\r\n\r\n     The ravening sea--Hastings and history--Titus Oates--Sir Cloudesley\r\n     Shovel--A stalwart Nestor--Edward Capel--An old Sussex harvest\r\n     custom--A poetical mayor--Picturesque Hastings--Hastings\r\n     castle--Hollington Rural and Charles Lamb--Fairlight Glen and the\r\n     Lover's Seat--Bexhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrighton, as we have seen, was made by Dr. Russell. It was Dr. Baillie,\r\nsome years later, who discovered the salubrious qualities of Hastings.\r\nIn 1806, when the Duke of Wellington (then Major-General Wellesley) was\r\nin command of twelve thousand soldiers encamped in the neighbourhood,\r\nand was himself living at Hastings House, the population of the town was\r\nless than four thousand; to-day, with St. Leonard's and dependant\r\nsuburbs, Hastings covers several square miles. With the exception of the\r\nlittle red and grey region known as Old Hastings, between Castle Hill\r\nand East Hill, the same charge of a lack of what is interesting can be\r\nbrought against Hastings as against Brighton; but whereas Brighton has\r\nthe Downs to offer, Hastings is backed by country of far less charm.\r\nPerhaps her greatest merit is her proximity to Winchelsea and Rye.\r\n\r\nHastings, once one of the proudest of the Cinque Ports, has no longer\r\neven a harbour, its pleasure yachts, which carry excursionists on brief\r\nChannel voyages, having to be beached just like rowing boats. The\r\nravages of the sea, which have so transformed the coast line of Sussex,\r\nhave completely changed this town; and from a stately seaport she has\r\nbecome a democratic watering place. Beneath the waves lie the remains of\r\nan old Priory and possibly of not a few churches.\r\n\r\nHastings has been very nigh to history more than once, but she has\r\nescaped the actual making of it. Even the great battle that takes its\r\nname from the town was fought seven miles away, while the Duke of\r\nNormandy, as we have seen, landed as far distant as Pevensey, ten miles\r\nin the west. But he used Hastings as a victualling centre. Again and\r\nagain, in its time, Hastings has been threatened with invasion by the\r\nFrench, who did actually land in 1138 and burned the town. And one\r\nSunday morning in 1643, Colonel Morley of Glynde, the Parliamentarian,\r\nmarched in with his men and confiscated all arms. But considering its\r\nwarlike mien, Hastings has done little.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ADMIRAL'S MOTHER]\r\n\r\nNor can the seaport claim any very illustrious son. Titus Oates, it is\r\ntrue, was curate of All Saints church in 1674, his father being vicar;\r\nand among the inhabitants of the old town was the mother of Sir\r\nCloudesley Shovel, the admiral. A charming account of a visit paid to\r\nher by her son is given in De la Prynne's diary: \"I heard a gentleman\r\nsay, who was in the ship with him about six years ago, that as they were\r\nsailing over against the town, of Hastings, in Sussex, Sir Cloudesley\r\ncalled out, 'Pilot, put near; I have a little business on shore.' So he\r\nput near, and Sir Cloudesley and this gentleman went to shore in a small\r\nboat, and having walked about half a mile, Sir Cloudesley came to a\r\nlittle house [in All Saints Street], 'Come,' says he, 'my business is\r\nhere; I came on purpose to see the good woman of this house.' Upon this\r\nthey knocked at the door, and out came a poor old woman, upon which Sir\r\nCloudesley kissed her, and then falling down on his knees, begged her\r\nblessing, and calling her mother (who had removed out of Yorkshire\r\nhither). He was mightily kind to her, and she to him, and after that he\r\nhad made his visit, he left her ten guineas, and took his leave with\r\ntears in his eyes and departed to his ship.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CHURCH MILITANT]\r\n\r\nHastings had a famous rector at the beginning of the last century, in\r\nthe person of the Rev. Webster Whistler, who combined with the eastern\r\nbenefice that of Newtimber, near Hurstpierpoint, and managed to serve\r\nboth to a great age. He lived to be eighty-four and died full of vigour\r\nin 1831. In 1817, following upon a quarrel with the squire, the\r\nNewtimber living was put up for auction in London. Mr. Whistler decided\r\nto be present, but anonymous. The auctioneer mentioned in his\r\nintroduction the various charms of the benefice, ending with the\r\nsuperlative advantage that it was held by an aged and infirm clergyman\r\nwith one foot in the grave. At this point the proceedings were\r\ninterrupted by a large and powerful figure in clerical costume springing\r\non the table and crying out to the company: \"Now, gentlemen, do I look\r\nlike a man tottering on the brink of the grave? My left leg gives me no\r\nsign of weakness, and as for the other, Mr. Auctioneer, if you repeat\r\nyour remarks you will find it very much at your service.\" The living\r\nfound no purchaser.\r\n\r\nMr. Whistler had a Chinese indifference to the necessary end of all\r\nthings, which prompted him to use an aged yew tree in his garden, that\r\nhad long given him shade but must now be felled, as material for his\r\ncoffin. This coffin he placed at the foot of his bed as a chest for\r\nclothes until its proper purpose was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nHastings was also the home of Edward Capel, a Shakespeare-editor of the\r\neighteenth century. Capel, who is said to have copied out in his own\r\nhand the entire works of the poet no fewer than ten times, was the\r\ndesigner of his own house, which seems to have been a miracle of\r\ndiscomfort. He was an eccentric of the most determined character, so\r\nmuch so that he gradually lost all friends. According to Horsfield, \"The\r\nspirit of nicety and refinement prevailed in it [his house] so much\r\nduring his lifetime, that when a friend (a baronet) called upon him on\r\na tour, he was desired to leave his cane in the vestibule, lest he\r\nshould either dirt the floor with it, or soil the carpet.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HARVEST HOME]\r\n\r\nOne does not think naturally of old Sussex customs in connection with\r\nthis town, so thoroughly urban as it now is and so largely populated by\r\nvisitors, but I find in the Sussex Archæological Collections the\r\nfollowing interesting account, by a Hastings alderman, of an old harvest\r\nceremony in the neighbourhood:--\"At the head of the table one of the men\r\noccupied the position of chairman; in front of him stood a pail--clean\r\nas wooden staves and iron hoops could be made by human labour. At his\r\nright sat four or five men who led the singing, grave as judges were\r\nthey; indeed, the appearance of the whole assembly was one of the\r\ngreatest solemnity, except for a moment or two when some unlucky wight\r\nfailed to 'turn the cup over,' and was compelled to undergo the penalty\r\nin that case made and provided. This done, all went on as solemnly as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"The ceremony, if I may call it so, was this: The leader, or chairman,\r\nstanding behind the pail with a tall horn cup in his hand, filled it\r\nwith beer from the pail. The man next to him on the left stood up, and\r\nholding a hat with both hands by the brim, crown upwards, received the\r\ncup from the chairman, on the crown of the hat, not touching it with\r\neither hand. He then lifted the cup to his lips by raising the hat, and\r\nslowly drank off the contents. As soon as he began to drink, the chorus\r\nstruck up this chant:\r\n\r\n\r\n     I've bin to Plymouth and I've bin to Dover.\r\n     I have bin rambling, boys, all the wurld over--\r\n         Over and over and over and over,\r\n     Drink up yur liquor and turn yur cup over;\r\n         Over and over and over and over,\r\n     The liquor's drink'd up and the cup is turned over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The man drinking was expected to time his draught so as to empty his\r\ncup at the end of the fourth line of the chant; he was then to return\r\nthe hat to the perpendicular, still holding the hat by the brim, then to\r\nthrow the cup into the air, and reversing the hat, to catch the cup in\r\nit as it fell. If he failed to perform this operation, the fellow\r\nworkmen who were closely watching him, made an important alteration in\r\nthe last line of their chant, which in that case ran thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n     The liquor's drink'd up and the cup _aint_ turned over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The cup was then refilled and the unfortunate drinker was compelled to\r\ngo through the same ceremony again. Every one at the table took the cup\r\nand 'turned it over' in succession, the chief shepherd keeping the pail\r\nconstantly supplied with beer. The parlour guests were of course invited\r\nto turn the cup over with the guests of the kitchen, and went through\r\nthe ordeal with more or less of success. For my own part, I confess that\r\nI failed to catch the cup in the hat at the first trial and had to try\r\nagain; the chairman, however, mercifully gave me only a small quantity\r\nof beer the second time.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MAYOR'S PRETTY LAMENT]\r\n\r\nThe civic life of Hastings would seem to encourage literature, for I\r\nfind also in one of the Archæological Society's volumes, the following\r\npretty lines by John Collier--Mayor of Hastings in 1719, 22, 30, 37, and\r\n41--on his little boy's death:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Ah, my poor son! Ah my tender child,\r\n     My unblown flower and now appearing sweet,\r\n     If yet your gentle soul flys in the air\r\n     And is not fixt in doom perpetual,\r\n     Hover about me with your airy wings\r\n     And hear your Father's lamentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHastings has two advantages over both Brighton and Eastbourne: it can\r\nproduce a genuine piece of antiquity, and seen from the sea it has a\r\npicturesque quality that neither of those towns possesses. Indeed, under\r\ncertain conditions of light, Hastings is magnificent, with the craggy\r\nCastle Hill in its midst surmounted by its imposing ruin. The smoke of\r\nthe town, rising and spreading, shrouds the modernity of the sea front,\r\nand the castle on its commanding height seems to be brooding over the\r\nshores of old romance. Brighton has no such effect as this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FIRST TOURNAMENT]\r\n\r\nOf the Castle little is known. It was probably built on the site of\r\nRoman fortifications, by the Comte d'Eu, who came over with the\r\nConqueror. The first tournament in England is said to have been held\r\nthere, with Adela, daughter of the Conqueror, as Queen of Beauty. After\r\nthe castle had ceased to be of any use as a stronghold it was still\r\nmaintained as a religious house. It is now a pleasure resort. The\r\nordinary visitor to Hastings is, however, more interested by the caves\r\nin the hill below, originally made by diggers of sand and afterwards\r\nused by smugglers.\r\n\r\nBefore branching out from Hastings into the country proper I might\r\nmention two neighbouring points of pilgrimage. One is Hollington Rural\r\nchurch, on the hill behind the town, whither sooner or later every one\r\nwalks. It is a small church in the midst of a crowded burial ground, and\r\nit is difficult to understand its attraction unless by the poverty of\r\nother objectives. I should not mention it, but that it is probably the\r\nchurch to which Charles Lamb, bored by Hastings itself, wended his way\r\none day in 1825. He describes it, in terms more fitting to, say,\r\nLullington church near Alfriston, or St. Olave's at Chichester, in no\r\nfewer than three of his letters. This is the best passage, revelling in\r\na kind of inverted exaggeration, as written to John Bates Dibdin, at\r\nHastings, in 1826:--\"Let me hear that you have clamber'd up to Lover's\r\nSeat; it is as fine in that neighbourhood as Juan Fernandez, as lonely\r\ntoo, when the Fishing boats are not out; I have sat for hours, staring\r\nupon the shipless sea. The salt sea is never so grand as when it is left\r\nto itself. One cock-boat spoils it. A sea mew or two improves it. And go\r\nto the little church, which is a very protestant Loretto, and seems\r\ndropt by some angel for the use of a hermit, who was at once parishioner\r\nand a whole parish. It is not too big. Go in the night, bring it away in\r\nyour portmanteau, and I will plant it in my garden. It must have been\r\nerected in the very infancy of British Christianity, for the two or\r\nthree first converts; yet hath it all the appertances of a church of the\r\nfirst magnitude, its pulpit, its pews, its baptismal font; a cathedral\r\nin a nutshell. Seven people would crowd it like a Caledonian Chapel. The\r\nminister that divides the word there, must give lumping pennyworths. It\r\nis built to the text of two or three assembled in my name. It reminds me\r\nof the grain of mustard seed. If the glebe land is proportionate, it may\r\nyield two potatoes. Tythes out of it could be no more split than a hair.\r\nIts First fruits must be its Last, for 'twould never produce a couple.\r\nIt is truly the strait and narrow way, and few there be (of London\r\nvisitants) that find it. The still small voice is surely to be found\r\nthere, if any where. A sounding board is merely there for ceremony. It\r\nis secure from earthquakes, not more from sanctity than size, for\r\n'twould feel a mountain thrown upon it no more than a taper-worm would.\r\nGo and see, but not without your spectacles.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LOVER'S SEAT]\r\n\r\nThe Lover's Seat, mentioned in the first sentence of the above passage,\r\nis at Fairlight, about two miles east of Hastings. The seat is very\r\nprettily situated high in a ledge in Fairlight Glen. Horsfield shall\r\ntell the story that gave the spot its fascinating name:--\r\n\r\n\"A beautiful girl at Rye gained the affections of Captain ----, then in\r\ncommand of a cutter in that station. Her parents disapproved the\r\nconnection and removed her to a farm house near the Lover's Seat, called\r\nthe Warren-house. Hence she contrived to absent herself night after\r\nnight, when she sought this spot, and by means of a light made known her\r\npresence to her lover, who was cruising off in expectation of her\r\narrival. The difficulties thus thrown in their way increased the ardour\r\nof their attachment and marriage was determined upon at all hazards.\r\nHollington Church was and is the place most sought for on these\r\noccasions in this part of the country; it has a romantic air about it\r\nwhich is doubtless peculiarly impressive. There are, too, some other\r\nreasons why so many matches are solemnized here; and all combined to\r\nmake this the place selected by this pair. It was expected that the\r\nlady's flight would be discovered and her object suspected; but in order\r\nto prevent a rescue, the cutter's crew positively volunteered and acted\r\nas guards on the narrow paths leading through the woods to the church.\r\nHowever, the marriage ceremony was completed before any unwelcome\r\nvisitors arrived, and reconciliation soon followed.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEXHILL]\r\n\r\nBexhill has now become so exceedingly accessible by conveyance from\r\nHastings that it might perhaps be mentioned here as a contiguous place\r\nof interest; but of Bexhill, till lately a village, or Bexhill-on-Sea,\r\nwatering place, with everything handsome about it, there is little to\r\nsay. Both the tide of the Channel and of popularity seem to be receding.\r\nInland there is some pretty country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nBATTLE ABBEY\r\n\r\n     Le Souvenir Normande--The Battle of Hastings--Normans and Saxons on\r\n     the eve--Taillefer--The battle cries--The death of Harold--Harold's\r\n     body: three stories--The field of blood--Building the Abbey--The\r\n     Abbot's privileges--Royal visitors--A great feast--The suppression\r\n     of the Abbey--Present-day Battle--An incredible\r\n     butler--Ashburnham--The last forge--Ninfield--Crowhurst.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal excursion from Hastings is of course to Battle, whither a\r\ncompany of discreetly satisfied Normans--Le Souvenir Normande--recently\r\ntravelled, to view with tactfully chastened enthusiasm the scene of the\r\ntriumph of 1066; to erect a memorial; and to perplex the old ladies of\r\nBattle who provide tea. Except on one day of the week visitors to Battle\r\nmust content themselves with tea (of which there is no stint) and a view\r\nof the gateway, for the rule of showing the Abbey only on Tuesdays is\r\nstrictly enforced by the American gentleman who now resides on this\r\nhistoric site. But the gateway could hardly be finer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BATTLE CRIES]\r\n\r\nThe battle-field was half a mile south of the Abbey, on Telham hill,\r\nwhere in Harold's day was a hoary apple tree. We have seen William\r\nlanding at Pevensey on September 28, 1066: thence he marched to Hastings\r\n\"to steal food,\" and thence, after a delay of a fortnight (to some\r\nextent spent in fortifying Hastings, and also in burning his boats), he\r\nmarched to Telham hill. That was on October 13. On the same day Harold\r\nreached the neighbourhood, with his horde of soldiers and armed\r\nrustics, and both armies encamped that night only a mile apart, waiting\r\nfor the light to begin the fray. The Saxons were confident and riotous;\r\nthe Normans hopeful and grave. According to Wace, \"all night the Saxons\r\nmight be seen carousing, gambolling, and dancing and singing: _bublie_\r\nthey cried, and _wassail_, and _laticome_ and _drinkheil_ and\r\n_drink-to-me_!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Battle Abbey, the Gateway._]\r\n\r\nAt daybreak in the Norman camp Bishop Odo celebrated High Mass, and\r\nimmediately after was hurried into his armour to join the fight. As the\r\nDuke was arming an incident occurred but for which Battle Abbey might\r\nnever have been built. His suit of mail was offered him wrong side out.\r\nThe superstitious Normans standing by looked sideways at each other with\r\nsinking misgiving. They deemed it a bad omen. But William's face\r\nbetrayed no fear. \"If we win,\" he said, \"and God send we may, I will\r\nfound an Abbey here for the salvation of the souls of all who fall in\r\nthe engagement.\" Before quitting his tent, he was careful that those\r\nrelics on which Harold had sworn never to oppose his efforts against\r\nEngland's throne should be hung around his neck.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TAILLEFER]\r\n\r\nSo the two armies were ready--the mounted Normans, with their conical\r\nhelmets gleaming in the hazy sunlight, with kite-shaped shields, huge\r\nspears and swords; the English, all on foot, with heavy axes and clubs.\r\nBut theirs was a defensive part; the Normans had to begin. It fell to\r\nthe lot of a wild troubadour named Taillefer to open the fight. He\r\ngalloped from the Norman lines at full speed, singing a song of heroes;\r\nthen checked his steed and tossed his lance thrice in the air, thrice\r\ncatching it by the point. The opposing lines silently wondered. Then he\r\nflung it at a luckless Saxon with all the energy of a madman, spitting\r\nhim as a skewer spits a lark. Taillefer had now only his sword left.\r\nThis also he threw thrice into the air, and then seizing it with the\r\ngrip of death he rode straight at the Saxon troops, dealing blows from\r\nleft to right, and so was lost to view.\r\n\r\nThus the Battle of Hastings began. \"On them in God's name,\" cried\r\nWilliam, \"and chastise these English for their misdeeds.\" \"Dieu aidé,\"\r\nhis men screamed, spurring to the attack. \"Out, Out!\" barked the\r\nEnglish, \"Holy Cross! God Almighty!\" The carnage was terrific. It seemed\r\nfor long that the English were prevailing; and they would, in all\r\nlikelihood, have prevailed in the end had they kept their position. But\r\nWilliam feigned a retreat, and the English crossed their vallum in\r\npursuit. The Normans at once turned their horses and pursued and\r\nbutchered the unprepared enemy singly in the open country. A complete\r\nrout followed. The false step was decisive.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE DEATH OF HAROLD]\r\n\r\nNot till night, however, did Harold fall. He upheld his standard to the\r\nlast, hedged about by a valiant bodyguard who resisted the Normans till\r\nevery sign of life was battered out of them. The story of the\r\nvertically-discharged arrows is a myth. An eye-witness thus described\r\nHarold's death: \"An armed man,\" said he, \"came in the throng of the\r\nbattle and struck him on the ventaille of the helmet and beat him to the\r\nground; and as he sought to recover himself a knight beat him down\r\nagain, striking him on the thick of the thigh down to the bone.\" So died\r\nHarold, on the exact site of the high altar of the Abbey, and so passed\r\naway the Saxon kingdom.\r\n\r\nThat night, William, who was unharmed, though three horses were killed\r\nunder him, had his tent set up in the midst of the dead, and there he\r\nate and drank. In the morning the Norman corpses were picked out and\r\nburied with due rites; the Saxons were left to rot. According to the\r\n_Carmen_ William I. had Harold's body wrapped in purple linen and\r\ncarried to Hastings, where it was buried on the cliff beneath a stone\r\ninscribed with the words: \"By the order of the Duke, you rest here, King\r\nHarold, as the guardian of the shore and the sea.\" Mr. Lower was\r\nconvinced of the truth of that story; but William of Malmesbury says\r\nthat William sent Harold's body to his mother the Countess Gytha, who\r\nburied it at Waltham, while a third account shows us Editha of the Swan\r\nNeck, Harold's wife, wandering through the blood-stained grass, among\r\nthe fallen English, until she found the body of her husband, which she\r\ncraved leave to carry away. William, this version adds, could not deny\r\nher.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FIELD OF BLOOD]\r\n\r\nFuller writes in the _Worthies_, concerning the wonders of\r\nSussex:--\"Expect not here I should insert what _William_ of _Newbury_\r\nwriteth (to be recounted rather amongst the _Untruths_ than _Wonders_);\r\nviz. 'That in this County, not far from Battail-Abby, in the Place\r\nwhere so great a slaughter of the Englishmen was made, after any shower,\r\npresently sweateth forth very fresh blood out of the Earth, as if the\r\nevidence thereof did plainly declare the voice of Bloud there shed, and\r\ncrieth still from the Earth unto the Lord.' This is as true, as that in\r\n_white_ chalky Countries (about Baldock in Hertfordshire) after rain run\r\nrivolets of _Milk_; Neither being anything else than the Water\r\ndiscoloured, according to the _Complexion_ of the Earth thereabouts.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mount Street, Battle._]\r\n\r\nThe Conqueror was true to his vow, and the Abbey of St. Martin was\r\nquickly begun. At first there was difficulty about the stone, which was\r\nbrought all the way from Caen quarries, until, according to an old\r\nwriter, a pious matron dreamed that stone in large quantities was to be\r\nfound near at hand. Her vision leading to the discovery of a\r\nneighbouring quarry, the work proceeded henceforward with exceeding\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ST. MARTIN'S ABBEY]\r\n\r\nAlthough the first Abbot was appointed in 1076, William the Conqueror\r\ndid not live to see the Abbey finished. Sixty monks of the Order of St.\r\nBenedict came to Battle from the Abbey of Marmontier in Normandy, to\r\nform its nucleus. It was left to William Rufus to preside over the\r\nconsecration of Battle, which was not until February, 1095, when the\r\nceremony was performed amid much pomp. William presented to the Abbey\r\nhis father's coronation robe and the sword he had wielded in the battle.\r\nSeveral wealthy manors were attached and the country round was exempted\r\nfrom tax; while the Abbots were made superior to episcopal control, and\r\nwere endowed with the right to sit in Parliament and a London house to\r\nlive in during the session. Indeed nothing was left undone that could\r\nminister to the pride and power of the new house of God.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey of St. Martin was quadrangular, standing in the midst of a\r\ncircle nine miles round. Within this were vineyards, stew ponds and rich\r\nland. Just without was a small street of artisans' dwellings, where were\r\nmanufactured all things requisite for the monks' material well-being.\r\nThe church was the largest in the country, larger even than Canterbury.\r\nIt was also a sanctuary, any sentenced criminal who succeeded in\r\nsheltering therein receiving absolution from the Abbot. The high altar,\r\nas I have said, was erected precisely on the spot where Harold fell: a\r\nspot on which one may now stand and think of the past.\r\n\r\nBattle Abbey was more than once visited by kings. In 1200 John was\r\nthere, shaking like a quicksand. He brought a piece of our Lord's\r\nsepulchre, which had been wrested from Palestine by Richard the Lion\r\nHeart, and laid it with tremulous hands on the altar, hoping that the\r\nmagnificence of the gift might close Heaven's eyes towards sins of his\r\nown. In 1212, he was at Battle Abbey again, and for the last time in\r\n1213, seeking, maybe, to find in these silent cloisters some\r\nforgetfulness of the mutterings of hate and scorn that everywhere\r\nfollowed him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: KINGS AT BATTLE]\r\n\r\nJust before the Battle of Lewes, Henry III. galloped up, attended by a\r\nbody-guard of overbearing horsemen, and levied large sums of money to\r\nassist him in the struggle. After the battle he returned, a weary\r\nrefugee, but still rapacious.\r\n\r\nThese visits were not welcome. It was different when Edward II. slept\r\nthere on the night of August 28th, 1324. Alan de Ketbury, the Abbot, was\r\nbent on showing loyalty at all cost, while the neighbouring lords and\r\nsquires were hardly less eager. The Abbot's contribution to the kitchen\r\nincluded twenty score and four loaves of bread, two swans, two rabbits,\r\nthree fessantes, and a dozen capons; William de Echingham sent three\r\npeacocks, twelve bream, six muttons, and other delicacies; and Robert\r\nAcheland four rabbits, six swans, and three herons.\r\n\r\nIn 1331, Abbot Hamo and his monks kept at bay a body of French\r\nmarauders, who had landed at Rye, until the country gentlemen could\r\nassemble and repulse them utterly.\r\n\r\nThen followed two peaceful centuries; but afterwards came disaster, for,\r\nin 1558, Thomas Cromwell sent down two commissioners to examine into the\r\nstate of the Abbey and report thereon to the zealous Defender of the\r\nFaith. The Commissioners found nineteen books in the library, and\r\nrumours of monkish debauchery without the walls. \"So beggary a house,\"\r\nwrote one of the officers, \"I never see.\" Battle Abbey was therefore\r\nsuppressed and presented to Sir Anthony Browne, upon whom, as we saw in\r\nthe first chapter, the \"Curse of Cowdray\" was pronounced by the last\r\ndeparting monk.\r\n\r\nTo catalogue the present features of Battle Abbey is to vulgarise it.\r\nOne comes away with confused memories of grey walls embraced by white\r\nclematis and red rose; gloomy underground caverns with double rows of\r\narches, where the Brothers might not speak; benignant cedars blessing\r\nthe turf with extended hands; fragrant limes waving their delicate\r\nleaves; an old rose garden with fantastic beds; a long yew walk where\r\nthe Brothers might meditatively pace--turning, perhaps, an epigram,\r\nregretting, perhaps, the world. Nothing now remains of the Refectory,\r\nwhere, of old, forty monks fed like one, except the walls. It once had a\r\nnoble roof of Irish oak, but that was taken to Cowdray and perished in\r\nthe fire there, together with the Abbey roll. One of the Abbey's first\r\ncharms is the appropriateness of its gardens; they too are old. In the\r\ncloisters, for instance, there are wonderful box borders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Battle Abbey. The Refectory._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TURNER'S PICTURE]\r\n\r\nTurner painted \"Battle Abbey: the spot where Harold fell,\" with a\r\ngreyhound pressing hard upon a hare in the foreground, and a Scotch fir\r\nItalianated into a golden bough.\r\n\r\nThe town of Battle has little interest. In the church is a brass to\r\nThomas Alfraye and his wife Elizabeth--Thomas Alfraye \"whose soul\"\r\naccording to his epitaph,\r\n\r\n\r\n     In active strength did passe\r\n     As nere was found his peere.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne would like to know more of this Samson. The tomb of Sir Anthony\r\nBrowne is also here; but it is not so imposing as that of his son, the\r\nfirst Viscount Montagu, which we saw at Easebourne. In the churchyard is\r\nthe grave of Isaac Ingall, the oldest butler on record, who died at the\r\nage of one hundred and twenty, after acting as butler at the Abbey for\r\nninety-five years.\r\n\r\nFrom Battle one may reach easily Normanhurst, the seat of the Brasseys,\r\nand Ashburnham Park, just to the north of it, a superb undulating\r\ndomain, with lakes, an imposing mansion, an old church, brake fern,\r\nmagnificent trees and a herd of deer, all within its confines. Of the\r\nchurch, however, I can say nothing, for I was there on a very hot day,\r\nthe door was locked, and the key was at the vicarage, ten minutes'\r\ndistant, at the top of a hill. Churches that are thus controlled must be\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ASHBURNHAM]\r\n\r\nAshburnham Place once contained some of the finest books in England and\r\nis still famous for its relics of Charles I.; but strangers may not see\r\nthem. The best Sussex iron was smelted at Ashburnham Furnace, north of\r\nthe park, near Penhurst. Ashburnham Forge was the last to remain at work\r\nin the county; its last surviving labourer of the neighbourhood died in\r\n1883. He remembered the extinguishing of the fire in 1813 (or 1811), the\r\ncasting of fire-backs being the final task. Penhurst, by the way, is one\r\nof the most curiously remote villages in east Sussex, with the oddest\r\nlittle church.\r\n\r\nI walked to Ashburnham from Ninfield, a clean breezy village on the hill\r\noverlooking Pevensey Bay, with a locked church, and iron stocks by the\r\nside of the road. It is stated somewhere that at \"that corner of Crouch\r\nLane that leads to Lunford Cross, and so to Bexhill and Hastings,\" was\r\nburied a suicide in 1675. At how many cross roads in Sussex and\r\nelsewhere does one stand over such graves?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CROWHURST]\r\n\r\nOne may return to Hastings by way of Catsfield, which has little\r\ninterest, and Crowhurst, famous for the remains of a beautiful manor\r\nhouse and a yew tree supposed to be the oldest in Sussex. It is curious\r\nthat Crowhurst in Surrey is also known for a great yew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nWINCHELSEA AND RYE\r\n\r\n     Medieval Sussex--The suddenness of Rye--The approach by\r\n     night--Cities of the plain--Old Winchelsea--The freakish sea--New\r\n     Winchelsea--The eternal French problem--Modern Winchelsea--The\r\n     Alard tombs--Denis Duval and the Westons--John Wesley--Old\r\n     Rye--John Fletcher--The Jeakes'--An unknown poet--Rye church--The\r\n     eight bells--Rye's streets--Rye ancient and modern--A Rye\r\n     ceramist--Pett--Icklesham's accounts--A complacent epitaph--Iden\r\n     and Playden--Udimore's church--Brede Place--The Oxenbridges--Dean\r\n     Swift as a baby.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of many good judges Sussex has nothing to offer so\r\nfascinating as Winchelsea and Rye; and in certain reposeful moods, when\r\nthe past seems to be more than the present or future, I can agree with\r\nthem. We have seen many ancient towns in our progress through the\r\ncounty--Chichester around her cathedral spire, Arundel beneath her grey\r\ncastle, Lewes among her hills--but all have modern blood in their veins.\r\nWinchelsea and Rye seem wholly of the past. Nothing can modernise them.\r\n\r\nRye approached from the east is the suddenest thing in the world. The\r\ntraveller leaves Ashford, in a South Eastern train, amid all the\r\ncircumstances of ordinary travel; he passes through the ordinary scenery\r\nof Kent; the porters call Rye, and in a moment he is in the middle ages.\r\n\r\nRye is only a few yards from its station: Winchelsea, on the other hand,\r\nis a mile from the line, and one has time on the road to understand\r\none's surroundings. It is important that the traveller who wishes to\r\nexperience the right medieval thrill should come to Winchelsea either at\r\ndusk or at night. To make acquaintance with any new town by night is to\r\ndouble one's pleasure; for there is a first joy in the curious half-seen\r\nstrangeness of the streets and houses, and a further joy in correcting\r\nby the morrow's light the distorted impressions gathered in the dark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Landgate, Rye._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: APPROACH AT DUSK]\r\n\r\nTo come for the first time upon Winchelsea at dusk, whether from the\r\nstation or from Rye, is to receive an impression almost if not quite\r\nunique in England; since there is no other town throned like this upon a\r\ngreen hill, to be gained only through massive gateways. From the station\r\none would enter at the Pipewell Gate; from Rye, by the Strand Gate. The\r\nStrand approach is perhaps a shade finer and more romantically unreal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FREAKISH SEA]\r\n\r\nWinchelsea and Rye are remarkable in being not only perched each upon a\r\nsolitary hillock in a vast level or marsh, but in being hillocks in\r\nthemselves. In the case of Winchelsea there are trees and green spaces\r\nto boot, but Rye and its hillock are one; every inch is given over to\r\nred brick and grey stone. They are true cities of the plain. Between\r\nthem are three miles of flat meadow, where, among thousands of sheep,\r\nstands the grey rotundity of Camber Castle. All this land is _polder_,\r\nas the Dutch call it, yet not reclaimed from the sea by any feat of\r\nengineering, as about the Helder, but presented by Neptune as a free and\r\nnot too welcome gift to these ancient boroughs--possibly to equalise his\r\ntheft of acres of good park at Selsey. Once a Cinque Port of the first\r\nmagnitude, Winchelsea is now an inland resort of the antiquary and the\r\nartist. Where fishermen once dropped their nets, shepherds now watch\r\ntheir sheep; where the marauding French were wont to rush in with sword\r\nand torch, tourists now toil with camera and guide-book.\r\n\r\nThe light above the sheep levels changes continually: at one hour Rye\r\nseems but a stone's throw from Winchelsea; at another she is miles\r\ndistant; at a third she looms twice her size through the haze, and\r\nCamber is seen as a fortress of old romance.\r\n\r\nRye stands where it always stood: but the original Winchelsea is no\r\nmore. It was built two miles south-south-east of Rye, on a spot since\r\ncovered by the sea but now again dry land. At Old Winchelsea William the\r\nConqueror landed in 1067 after a visit to Normandy; in 1138 Henry II.\r\nlanded there, while the French landed often, sometimes disastrously and\r\nsometimes not. In those days Winchelsea had seven hundred householders\r\nand fifty inns. In 1250, however, began her downfall. Holinshed\r\nwrites:--\"On the first day of October (1250), the moon, upon her change,\r\nappearing exceeding red and swelled, began to show tokens of the great\r\ntempest of wind that followed, which was so huge and mightie, both by\r\nland and sea, that the like had not been lightlie knowne, and seldome,\r\nor rather never heard of by men then alive. The sea forced contrarie to\r\nhis natural course, flowed twice without ebbing, yeelding such a rooring\r\nthat the same was heard (not without great woonder) a farre distance\r\nfrom the shore. Moreover, the same sea appeared in the darke of the\r\nnight to burne, as it had been on fire, and the waves to strive and\r\nfight togither after a marvellous sort, so that the mariners could not\r\ndevise how to save their ships where they laie at anchor, by no cunning\r\nor shift which they could devise. At Hert-burne three tall-ships\r\nperished without recoverie, besides other smaller vessels. At\r\nWinchelsey, besides other hurte that was doone, in bridges, milles,\r\nbreakes, and banks, there were 300 houses and some churches drowned with\r\nthe high rising of the water course.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WINCHELSEA'S VICISSITUDES]\r\n\r\nThe Winchelsea people, however, did not abandon their town. In 1264\r\nHenry III. was there on his way to the Battle of Lewes, and later,\r\nEleanor, wife of Henry's conqueror, de Montfort, was there too, and\r\nencouraged by her kindness to them the Winchelsea men took to active sea\r\npiracy, which de Montfort encouraged. In 1266, however, Prince Edward,\r\nwho disliked piracy, descended upon the town and chastised it bloodily;\r\nwhile on February 4, 1287, a greater punishment came, for during another\r\nstorm the town was practically drowned, all the flat land between Pett\r\nand Hythe being inundated. New Winchelsea, the Winchelsea of to-day, was\r\nforthwith begun under royal patronage on a rock near Icklesham, the\r\nnorth and east sides of which were washed by the sea. A castle was set\r\nthere, and gates, of which three still stand--Pipewell, Strand and\r\nNew--rose from the earth. The Grey Friars monastery and other religious\r\nhouses were reproduced as at Old Winchelsea, and a prosperous town\r\nquickly existed.\r\n\r\nNew Winchelsea was soon busy. In 1350 a battle between the English and\r\nSpanish fleets was waged off the town, an exciting spectacle for the\r\nCourt, who watched from the high ground. Edward III., the English king,\r\nwhen victory was his, rode to Etchingham for the night. In 1359, 3,000\r\nFrenchmen entered Winchelsea and set fire to it; while in 1360 the\r\nCinque Ports navy sailed from Winchelsea and burned Luce. Such were the\r\nreprisals of those days. In 1376 the French came again and were repulsed\r\nby the Abbot of Battle, but in 1378 the Abbot had to run. In 1448 the\r\nFrench came for the last time, the sea having become very shallow; and a\r\nlittle later the sea receded altogether, Henry VIII. suppressed the\r\nreligious houses, and Winchelsea's heyday was over.\r\n\r\nShe is now a quiet, aloof settlement of pleasant houses and gardens,\r\nprosperous and idle. Rye might be called a city of trade, Winchelsea of\r\nrepose. She spreads her hands to the sun and is content.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ALARD TOMBS]\r\n\r\nWinchelsea's church stands, as a church should, in the midst of its\r\ngreen acre, fully visible from every side--the very antipodes of Rye.\r\nLarge as it now is, it was once far larger, for only the chancel and\r\nside aisles remain. The glory of the church is the canopied tomb of\r\nGervase Alard, Admiral of the Cinque Ports, and that of his grandson\r\nStephen Alard, also Admiral, both curiously carved with grotesque heads.\r\nThe roof beams of the church, timber from wrecked or broken ships, are\r\nof an integrity so thorough that a village carpenter who recently\r\nclimbed up to test them blunted all his tools in the enterprise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Sedilia and Tombs of Gervase and Stephen Alard,\r\nWinchelsea._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE WESTONS]\r\n\r\nAll that remains of the Grey Friars monastery may now be seen (on\r\nMondays only) in the estate called The Friars: the shell of the chapel's\r\nchoir, prettily covered with ivy. Here once lived, in the odour of\r\nperfect respectability, the brothers Weston, who, country gentlemen of\r\nquiet habit at home, for several years ravaged the coach roads elsewhere\r\nas highwaymen, and were eventually hanged at Tyburn. Their place in\r\nliterature is, of course, _Denis Duval_, which Thackeray wrote in a\r\nhouse on the north of the churchyard, and which is all of Winchelsea and\r\nRye compact, as the author's letters to Mr. Greenwood, editor of\r\n_Cornhill_, detailing the plot (in the person of Denis himself) go to\r\nshow. Thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"I was born in the year 1764, at Winchelsea, where my father was a\r\n     grocer and clerk of the church. Everybody in the place was a good\r\n     deal connected with smuggling.\r\n\r\n     \"There used to come to our house a very noble French gentleman,\r\n     called the COUNT DE LA MOTTE, and with him a German, the BARON DE\r\n     LÜTTERLOH. My father used to take packages to Ostend and Calais for\r\n     these two gentlemen, and perhaps I went to Paris once, and saw the\r\n     French Queen.\r\n\r\n     \"The squire of our town was SQUIRE WESTON of the Priory, who, with\r\n     his brother, kept one of the genteelest houses in the country. He\r\n     was churchwarden of our church, and much respected. Yes, but if you\r\n     read the _Annual Register_ of 1781, you will find that on the 13th\r\n     July the sheriffs attended at the TOWER OF LONDON to receive\r\n     custody of a De la Motte, a prisoner charged with high treason. The\r\n     fact is, this Alsatian nobleman being in difficulties in his own\r\n     country (where he had commanded the Regiment Soubise), came to\r\n     London, and under pretence of sending prints to France and Ostend,\r\n     supplied the French Ministers with accounts of the movements of the\r\n     English fleets and troops. His go-between was Lütterloh, a\r\n     Brunswicker, who had been a crimping-agent, then a servant, who was\r\n     a spy of France and Mr. Franklin, and who turned king's evidence on\r\n     La Motte, and hanged him.\r\n\r\n     \"This Lütterloh, who had been a crimping-agent for German troops\r\n     during the American war, then a servant in London during the Gordon\r\n     riots, then an agent for a spy, then a spy over a spy, I suspect to\r\n     have been a consummate scoundrel, and doubly odious from speaking\r\n     English with a German accent.\r\n\r\n     \"What if he wanted to marry THAT CHARMING GIRL, who lived with Mr.\r\n     Weston at Winchelsea? Ha! I see a mystery here.\r\n\r\n     \"What if this scoundrel, going to receive his pay from the English\r\n     Admiral, with whom he was in communication at Portsmouth, happened\r\n     to go on board the _Royal George_ the day she went down?\r\n\r\n     \"As for George and Joseph Weston, of the Priory, I am sorry to say\r\n     they were rascals too. They were tried for robbing the Bristol mail\r\n     in 1780; and being acquitted for want of evidence, were tried\r\n     immediately after on another indictment for forgery--Joseph was\r\n     acquitted, but George was capitally convicted. But this did not\r\n     help poor Joseph. Before their trials, they and some others broke\r\n     out of Newgate, and Joseph fired at, and wounded, a porter who\r\n     tried to stop him, on Snow Hill. For this he was tried and found\r\n     guilty on the Black Act, and hung along with his brother.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, if I was an innocent participator in De la Motte's treasons,\r\n     and the Westons' forgeries and robberies, what pretty scrapes I\r\n     must have been in.\r\n\r\n     \"I married the young woman, whom the brutal Lütterloh would have\r\n     had for himself, and lived happy ever after.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DENIS DUVAL'S BOYHOOD]\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"My grandfather's name was Duval; he was a barber and perruquier by\r\n     trade, and elder of the French Protestant church at Winchelsea. I\r\n     was sent to board with his correspondent, a Methodist grocer, at\r\n     Rye.\r\n\r\n     \"These two kept a fishing-boat, but the fish they caught was many\r\n     and many a barrel of Nantz brandy, which we landed--never mind\r\n     where--at a place to us well known. In the innocence of my heart,\r\n     I--a child--got leave to go out fishing. We used to go out at night\r\n     and meet ships from the French coast.\r\n\r\n     \"I learned to scuttle a marlinspike,\r\n                   reef a lee-scupper,\r\n                   keelhaul a bowsprit\r\n\r\n     as well as the best of them. How well I remember the jabbering of\r\n     the Frenchmen the first night as they handed the kegs over to us!\r\n     One night we were fired into by his Majesty's revenue cutter\r\n     _Lynx_. I asked what those balls were fizzing in the water, etc.\r\n\r\n     \"I wouldn't go on with the smuggling; being converted by Mr.\r\n     Wesley, who came to preach to us at Rye--but that is neither here\r\n     nor there....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Ypres Tower, Rye._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JOHN WESLEY]\r\n\r\nIt was under the large tree of the west wall of the churchyard that in\r\n1790 John Wesley preached his last outdoor sermon, afterwards walking\r\nthrough \"that poor skeleton of ancient Winchelsea,\" as he called it.\r\n\r\nRye, like Winchelsea, has had a richer history than I can cope with. She\r\nwas an important seaport from the earliest times; and among other of our\r\nenemies who knew her value were the Danes, two hundred and fifty of\r\nwhose vessels entered the harbour in the year 893. Later the French\r\ncontinually menaced her, hardly less than her sister Cinque Port, but\r\nRye bore so little malice that during the persecutions in France in the\r\nsixteenth century she received hundreds of Huguenot refugees, whose\r\ndescendants still live in the town. Many monarchs have come hither,\r\namong them Queen Elizabeth, in 1573, dubbing Rye \"Rye Royal\" and\r\nWinchelsea \"Little London.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE THREE JEAKES]\r\n\r\nRye has had at least one notable son, John Fletcher the dramatist,\r\nassociate of Francis Beaumont and perhaps of Shakespeare, and author of\r\n\"The Faithful Shepherdess.\" Fletcher's father was vicar of Rye. The town\r\nalso gave birth to a curious father, son, and grandson, all named Samuel\r\nJeake. The first, born in 1623, the author of \"The Charters of the\r\nCinque Ports,\" 1728, was a lawyer, a bold Nonconformist, a preacher, an\r\nastrologer and an alchemist, whose library contained works in fifteen\r\nlanguages but no copy of Shakespeare or Milton. He left a treatise on\r\nthe Elixir of Life. The second, at the age of nineteen, was \"somewhat\r\nacquainted with the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, rhetoric, logic, poetry,\r\nnatural philosophy, arithmetic, geometry, cosmography, astronomy,\r\nastrology, geography, theology, physics, dialling, navigation,\r\ncaligraphy, stenography, drawing, heraldry and history.\" He also drew\r\nhoroscopes, wrote treatises on astrology and other sciences, suffered,\r\nlike his father, for his religion, and when he was twenty-nine married\r\nElizabeth Hartshorne, aged thirteen and a half. They had six children.\r\nThe third Samuel Jeake was famous for constructing a flying machine,\r\nwhich refused to fly, and nearly killed him.\r\n\r\nRye also possessed an unknown poet. On a blank leaf in an old book in\r\nthe town's archives is written this poem, in the hand of Henry VIII.'s\r\ntime:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     What greater gryffe may hape\r\n     Trew lovers to anoye,\r\n     Then absente for to sepratte them\r\n     From ther desiered joye?\r\n\r\n     What comforte reste them then\r\n     To ease them of ther smarte,\r\n     But for to thincke and myndful bee\r\n     Of them they love in harte?\r\n\r\n     And eicke that they assured bee\r\n     Etche toe another in harte,\r\n     That nothinge shall them seperate\r\n     Untylle deathe doe them parte?\r\n\r\n     And thoughe the dystance of the place\r\n     Doe severe us in twayne,\r\n     Yet shall my harte thy harte imbrace\r\n     Tyll we doe meete agayne.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SANGUINARY BUTCHER]\r\n\r\nThe church, the largest in Sussex, dominates Rye from every point, and\r\nso tightly are the houses compressed that from the plain the spire seems\r\nto be the completion not only of the church but of the town too. The\r\nbuilding stands in what is perhaps the quietest and quaintest church\r\nsquare in England, possessing beyond all question the discreetest of\r\npawnbroker's shops, marked by three brass balls that positively have\r\ncharm. The church is cool and spacious, with noble plain windows (and\r\none very pretty little one by Burne-Jones), and some very interesting\r\narchitectural features. Too little care seems, however, to have been\r\nspent upon it at some previous time. The verger shows with a pride\r\nlittle short of proprietary a mahogany altar said to have been taken\r\nfrom one of the vessels of the Armada (and therefore oddly inappropriate\r\nfor a Church of England service), and the tomb of one Alan Grebell, who,\r\nhappening one night in 1742 to be wearing the cloak of his\r\nbrother-in-law the Mayor, was killed in mistake for him by a \"sanguinary\r\nbutcher\" named Breeds. Breeds, who was hanged in chains for his crime,\r\nremains perhaps the most famous figure in the history of Rye.\r\n\r\nExternally Rye church is magnificent, but the pity of it is that its\r\nencroaching square deprives one of the power to study it as a whole.\r\nAmong the details, however, are two admirable flying buttresses. The\r\nclock over the beautiful north window, which is said to have been given\r\nto the town by Queen Elizabeth, is remarkable for the two golden cherubs\r\nthat strike the hours, and the pendulum that swings in the central tower\r\nof the church, very nigh the preacher's head.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EIGHT BELLS]\r\n\r\nRye's eight bells bear the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     To honour both of God and King\r\n     Our voices shall in concert ring.\r\n\r\n     May heaven increase their bounteous store\r\n     And bless their souls for evermore.\r\n\r\n     Whilst thus we join in joyful sound\r\n     May love and loyalty abound.\r\n\r\n     Ye people all who hear me ring\r\n     Be faithful to your God and King.\r\n\r\n     Such wondrous power to music's given\r\n     It elevates the soul to heaven.\r\n\r\n     If you have a judicious ear\r\n     You'll own my voice is sweet and clear.\r\n\r\n     Our voices shall with joyful sound\r\n     Make hills and valleys echo round.\r\n\r\n     In wedlock bands all ye who join,\r\n       With hands your hearts unite;\r\n     So shall our tuneful tongues combine\r\n       To laud the nuptial rite.\r\n\r\n     Ye ringers, all who prize\r\n       Your health and happiness,\r\n     Be sober, merry, wise,\r\n       And you'll the same possess.\r\n\r\n\r\nHardly less interesting than the church are the by-streets of Rye, so\r\nold and simple and quiet and right; particularly perhaps Mermaid Street,\r\nwith its beautiful hospital. In the High Street, which is busier, is\r\nthe George Inn, the rare possessor of a large assembly room with a\r\nmusicians' gallery. One only of Rye's gates is standing--the Landgate;\r\nbut on the south rampart of the town is the Ypres Tower (called Wipers\r\nby the prosaic inhabitants), a relic of the twelfth century, guarding\r\nRye once from perils by sea and now from perils by land. Standing by the\r\ntower one may hear below shipbuilders busy at work and observe all the\r\nlow-pulsed life of the river. A mile or so away is Rye Harbour, and\r\nbeyond it the sea; across the intervening space runs a little train with\r\nits freight of golf players. In the east stretches Romney Marsh to the\r\nhills of Folkestone.\r\n\r\nExtremes meet in Rye. When I was last there the passage of the Landgate\r\nwas made perilous by an approaching Panhard; the monastery of the\r\nAugustine friars on Conduit Hill had become a Salvation Army barracks;\r\nand in the doorway of the little fourteenth-century chapel of the\r\nCarmelites, now a private house, in the church square, a perambulator\r\nwaited. Moreover, in the stately red house at the head of Mermaid Street\r\nthe author of _The Awkward Age_ prosecutes his fascinating analyses of\r\ntwentieth-century temperaments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RYE POTTERY]\r\n\r\nAmong the industries of Rye is the production of an ingenious variety of\r\npottery achieved by affixing to ordinary vessels of earthenware a veneer\r\nof broken pieces of china--usually fragments of cups and saucers--in\r\ndefinite patterns that sometimes reach a magnificence almost Persian.\r\nFor the most part the result is not perhaps beautiful, but it is always\r\ngay, and the Rye potter who practises the art deserves encouragement. I\r\nsaw last summer a piece of similar ware in a cottage on the banks of the\r\nEttrick, but whether it had travelled thither from Rye, or whether\r\nScotch artists work in the same medium, I do not know. Mr. Gasson, the\r\nartificer (the dominating name of Gasson is to Rye what that of Seiler\r\nis to Zermatt), charges a penny for the inspection of the four rooms of\r\nhis house in which his pottery, his stuffed birds and other curiosities\r\nare collected. The visit must be epoch-making in any life. Never again\r\nwill a broken tea-cup be to any of Mr. Gasson's patrons merely a broken\r\ntea-cup. Previously it may have been that and nothing more; henceforward\r\nit is valuable material which, having completed one stage of existence,\r\nis, like the good Buddhist, entering upon another of increased radiance.\r\nMore, broken china may even become the symbol of Rye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Court Lodge, Udimore._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PETT AND ICKLESHAM]\r\n\r\nBetween Hastings and Winchelsea are the villages of Guestling, Pett, and\r\nIcklesham, the last two on the edge of the Level. Of these, Icklesham is\r\nthe most interesting, Guestling having recently lost its church by fire,\r\nand Pett church being new. Pett stands in a pleasant position at the end\r\nof the high ground, with nothing in the east but Pett Level, and the sea\r\nonly a mile away. At very low tide the remains of a submerged forest\r\nwere once discernible, and may still be.\r\n\r\nIcklesham also stands on the ridge further north, overlooking the Level\r\nand the sea, with Winchelsea not two miles distant in the east. The\r\nchurch is a very fine one, with a most interesting Norman tower in its\r\nmidst. The churchwardens accounts contain some quaint entries:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHURCHWARDENS' ACCOUNTS]\r\n\r\n1732.

A party of Cheyneys once succeeded in catching an\r\nOxenbridge asleep in his bed, and killed him. Old Place farm, a little\r\nnorth of Icklesham, between the village and the line, marks the site of\r\nOld Place, the mansion of the Fynches, earls of Winchelsea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLAYDEN AND IDEN]\r\n\r\nThe mainland proper begins hard by Rye, on the other side of the\r\nrailway, where Rye Hill carries the London road out of sight. This way\r\nlie Playden, Iden, and Peasmarsh: Playden, with a slender spire, of a\r\ngrace not excelled in a county notable, as we have seen, for graceful\r\nspires, but a little overweighted perhaps by its cross, within whose\r\nchurch is the tomb of a Flemish brewer, named Zoctmanns, calling for\r\nprayers for his soul; Iden, with a square tower and a stair turret, a\r\nvillage taking its name from that family of which Alexander Iden, slayer\r\nof Jack Cade, was a member, its home being at Mote, now non-existent;\r\nand Peasmarsh, whose long modest church, crowned by a squat spire, may\r\nbe again seen, like the swan upon St. Mary's Lake, in the water at the\r\nfoot of the churchyard. At Peasmarsh was born a poor artificial poet\r\nnamed William Pattison, in whose works I have failed to find anything of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Udimore Church._]\r\n\r\nThe two most interesting spots in the hilly country immediately north of\r\nthe Brede valley (north of Winchelsea) are Udimore and Brede. Concerning\r\nUdimore church, which externally has a family resemblance to that of\r\nSteyning, it is told that it was originally planned to rise on the other\r\nside of the little river Ree. The builders began their work, but every\r\nnight saw the supernatural removal of the stones to the present site,\r\nwhile a mysterious voice uttered the words \"O'er the mere! O'er the\r\nmere!\" Hence, says the legend, the present position of the fane, and the\r\nbeautiful name Udimore, or \"O'er the mere,\" which, of course, becomes\r\nUddymer among the villagers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brede Place._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BREDE PLACE]\r\n\r\nFrom Udimore one reaches Brede by turning off the high road about two\r\nmiles to the east. But it is worth while to keep to the road a little\r\nlonger, and entering Gilly Wood (on the right) explore as wild and\r\nbeautiful a ravine as any in the county. And, on the Brede by-road, it\r\nis worth while also to turn aside again in order to see Brede Place.\r\nThis house, like all the old mansions (it is of the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries), is set in a hollow, and is sufficiently gloomy in\r\nappearance and surroundings to lend colour to the rumour that would have\r\nit haunted--a rumour originally spread by the smugglers who for some\r\nyears made the house their headquarters. An underground passage is said\r\nto lead from Brede Place to the church, a good part of a mile distant;\r\nbut as is usual with underground passages, the legend has been held so\r\ndear that no one seems to have ventured upon the risk of disproving it.\r\nAmid these medieval surroundings the late Stephen Crane, the American\r\nwriter, conceived some of his curiously modern stories.\r\n\r\nOne of the original owners (the Oxenbridges) like Col. Lunsford of East\r\nHoathly was credited by the country people with an appetite for\r\nchildren. Nothing could compass his death but a wooden saw, with which\r\nafter a drunken bout the villagers severed him in Stubb's Lane, by\r\nGroaning Bridge. Not all the family, however, were bloodthirsty, for at\r\nleast two John Oxenbridges of the sixteenth century were divines, one a\r\nCanon of Windsor, the other a \"grave and reverent preacher.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEAN SWIFT'S CRADLE]\r\n\r\nThe present vicar of Brede, the village on the hill above Brede Place,\r\nhas added to the natural antiquities of his church several alien\r\ncuriosities, chief among them being the cradle in which Dean Swift was\r\nrocked. It is worth a visit to Brede church to be persuaded that that\r\nmatured Irishman ever was a baby.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brede Place, from the South._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nROBERTSBRIDGE\r\n\r\n     Horace Walpole in difficulties--A bibliophile's\r\n     threat--Salehurst--Bodiam--Northiam--Queen Elizabeth's dinner and\r\n     shoes--Brightling--Jack Fuller--Turner in East Sussex--The Burwash\r\n     country--Sussex superstitions--_Sussex Folk and Sussex\r\n     Ways_--Liberals and Conservatives--The Sussex\r\n     character--Independent bellringers--\"Silly Sussex\"--Burwash at\r\n     Cricket--James Hurdis--A donkey race--\"A hint to great and little\r\n     men\"--Henry Burwash--Etchingham--Sir John Lade and the\r\n     Prince--Ticehurst and Wadhurst.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobertsbridge is not in itself a particularly attractive place; but it\r\nhas a good inn, and many interesting villages may be reached from it,\r\nthe little light railway that runs from the town to Tenterden, along the\r\nRother valley, making the exploration of this part of Sussex very\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole came to difficulties hereabout during his Sussex journey.\r\nHis sprightly and heightened account is in one of the letters: \"The\r\nroads grew bad beyond all badness, the night dark beyond all darkness,\r\nour guide frightened beyond all frightfulness. However, without being at\r\nall killed, we got up, or down--I forget which, it was so dark,--a\r\nfamous precipice called Silver Hill, and about ten at night arrived at a\r\nwretched village called Rotherbridge. We had still six miles hither, but\r\ndetermined to stop, as it would be a pity to break our necks before we\r\nhad seen all we had intended. But, alas! there was only one bed to be\r\nhad: all the rest were inhabited by smugglers, whom the people of the\r\nhouse called mountebanks; and with one of whom the lady of the den told\r\nMr. Chute he might lie. We did not at all take to this society, but,\r\narmed with links and lanthorns, set out again upon this impracticable\r\njourney. At two o'clock in the morning we got hither to a still worse\r\ninn, and that crammed with excise officers, one of whom had just shot a\r\nsmuggler. However, as we were neutral powers, we have passed safely\r\nthrough both armies hitherto, and can give you a little farther history\r\nof our wandering through these mountains, where the young gentlemen are\r\nforced to drive their curricles with a pair of oxen. The only morsel of\r\ngood road we have found, was what even the natives had assured us were\r\ntotally impracticable; these were eight miles to Hurst Monceaux.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOR BOOK BORROWERS]\r\n\r\nA pretty memento of the Cistercian Abbey here, of which small traces\r\nremain on the bank of the river, has wandered to the Bodleian, in the\r\nshape of an old volume containing the inscription: \"This book belongs to\r\nSt. Mary of Robertsbridge; whoever shall steal or sell it, let him be\r\nAnathema Maranatha!\" Since no book was ever successfully protected by\r\nanything less tangible than a chain, it came into other hands,\r\nunderneath being written: \"I John Bishop of Exeter know not where the\r\naforesaid house is; nor did I steal this book, but acquired it in a\r\nlawful way.\" On the suppression of the Abbey of Robertsbridge by Henry\r\nVIII. the lands passed to Sir William Sidney, grandfather of Sir Philip.\r\n\r\nSalehurst, just across the river from Robertsbridge, has a noble church,\r\nstanding among trees on the hill side--the hill which Walpole found so\r\nprecipitous. Within, the church is not perhaps quite so impressive as\r\nwithout, but it has monuments appertaining probably to the Culpepers,\r\nonce a far-reaching aristocratic Sussex family, which we met first at\r\nArdingly, and which is now extinct or existent only among the peasantry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bodiam Castle._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BODIAM CASTLE]\r\n\r\nThe first station on the Rother valley light railway is Bodiam, only a\r\nfew steps from Bodiam Castle sitting serenely like a bird on the waters\r\nof her moat. This building in appearance and form fulfils most of the\r\nconditions of the castle, and by retaining water in its moat perhaps\r\nwins more respect than if it had stood a siege. (Local tradition indeed\r\ncredits it with that mark of active merit, but history is silent.) It\r\nwas built in the fourteenth century by Sir Edward Dalyngruge, a hero of\r\nCressy and Poictiers. It is now a ruin within, but (as Mr. Griggs'\r\ndrawing shows) externally in fair preservation and a very interesting\r\nand romantic spectacle.\r\n\r\nBelow Bodiam is Ewhurst, and a little farther east, close to the Kentish\r\nborder, Northiam. Ewhurst has no particular interest, but Northiam is a\r\nvillage apart. Knowing what we do of Sussex speech we may be certain\r\nthat Northiam is not pronounced by the native as it is spelt. Norgem is\r\nits local style, just as Udiham is Udgem and Bodiam Bodgem. But though\r\nhe will not give Northiam its pleasant syllables, the Northiam man is\r\nproud of his village. He has a couplet:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Oh rare Northiam, thou dost far exceed\r\n     Beckley, Peasmarsh, Udimore and Brede.\r\n\r\n\r\nNorthiam's superiority to these pleasant spots is not absolute; but\r\nthere are certain points in which the couplet is sound. For example,\r\nalthough Brede Place has no counterpart in Northiam, and although beside\r\nUdimore's lovely name Northiam has an uninspired prosaic ring, yet\r\nNorthiam is alone in the possession of Queen Elizabeth's Oak, the tree\r\nbeneath which that monarch, whom we have seen on a progress in West\r\nSussex, partook in 1573 of a banquet, on her way to Rye. The fare came\r\nfrom the kitchen of the timbered house hard by, then the residence of\r\nMaster Bishopp. During the visit her Majesty changed her shoes, and the\r\ndiscarded pair is still treasured at Brickwall, the neighbouring seat of\r\nthe Frewens, the great family of Northiam for many generations. The\r\nshoes are of green damask silk, with heels two and a half inches high\r\nand pointed toes. The Queen was apparently so well satisfied with her\r\nrepast that on her return journey three days later she dined beneath the\r\noak once more. But she changed no more shoes.\r\n\r\nBrickwall, which is occasionally shown, is a noble old country mansion,\r\npartly Elizabethan and partly Stuart. In the church are many Frewen\r\nmemorials, the principal of which are in the Frewen mausoleum, a\r\ncomparatively new erection. Accepted Frewen, Archbishop of York, was\r\nfrom Northiam.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A DANISH VESSEL]\r\n\r\nIn a field near the Rother at Northiam was discovered, in the year 1822,\r\na Danish vessel, which had probably sunk in the ninth century in some\r\nwide waterway now transformed to land or shrunk to the dimensions of the\r\npresent stream. Her preservation was perfect. Horsfield thus describes\r\nthe ship: \"Her dimensions were, from head to stern, 65 feet, and her\r\nwidth 14 feet, with cabin and forecastle; and she appears to have\r\noriginally had a whole deck. She was remarkably strongly built; her bill\r\npieces and keels measuring 2 feet over, her cross beams, five in number,\r\n18 inches by 8, with her other timbers in proportion; and in her\r\ncaulking was a species of moss peculiar to the country in which she was\r\nbuilt. In the cabin and other parts of the vessel were found a human\r\nskull; a pair of goat's horns attached to a part of the cranium; a dirk\r\nor poniard, about half an inch of the blade of which had wholly resisted\r\ncorrosion; several glazed and ornamental tiles of a square form; some\r\nbricks which had formed the fire hearth; several parts of shoes, or\r\nrather sandals, fitting low on the foot, one of which was apparently in\r\nan unfinished state, having a last remaining in it, all of them very\r\nbroad at the toes; two earthern jars and a stone mug, all of very\r\nancient shape, a piece of board exhibiting about thirty perforations,\r\nprobably designed for keeping the lunar months, or some game or\r\namusement; with many other antique relics.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OLD JACK FULLER]\r\n\r\nFour miles west of Robertsbridge, up hill and down, is Brightling, whose\r\nNeedle, standing on Brightling Down, 646 feet high, is visible from most\r\nof the eminences in this part of Sussex. The obelisk, together with the\r\nneighbouring observatory, was built on the site of an old beacon by the\r\nfamous Jack Fuller--famous no longer, but in his day (he died in 1834\r\naged seventy-seven) a character both in London and in Sussex. He was big\r\nand bluff and wealthy and the squire of Rose Hill. He sat for Sussex\r\nfrom 1801 to 1812, and was once carried from the House by the Sergeant\r\nat Arms and his minions, for refusing to give way in a debate and\r\ncalling the Speaker \"the insignificant little fellow in a wig.\" His\r\nelection cost him _£_20,000 plus _£_30,000 subscribed by the county. When\r\nPitt offered him a peerage he said no: \"I was born Jack Fuller and Jack\r\nFuller I'll die.\" When he travelled from Rose Hill to London Mr.\r\nFuller's progresses were almost regal. The coach was provisioned as if\r\nfor arctic exploration and coachman and footmen alike were armed with\r\nswords and pistols. (\"Honest Jack,\" as Mr. Lower remarks, put a small\r\nvalue upon the honesty of others.) Mr. Fuller had two hobbies, music and\r\nscience. He founded the Fullerian professorships (which he called his\r\ntwo children), and contributed liberally to the Royal Institution; and\r\nhis musical parties in London were famous. But whether it is true that\r\nwhen the Brightling choir dissatisfied him he presented the church with\r\nnine bassoons, I cannot say.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TURNER IN SUSSEX]\r\n\r\nJohn Fuller has a better claim to be remembered in Sussex by his\r\npurchase of Bodiam Castle, when its demolition was threatened, and by\r\nhis commission to Turner to make pictures in the Rape of Hastings, five\r\nof which were engraved and published in folio form, in 1819, under the\r\ntitle _Views in Sussex_. One of these represents the Brightling\r\nObservatory as seen from Rosehill Park. As a matter of fact, the\r\nobservatory, being of no interest, is almost invisible, although Mr.\r\nReinagle, A.R.A., who supplies the words to the pictures, calls it the\r\n\"most important point in the scene.\" Furthermore, he says that the\r\nartist has expressed a shower proceeding \"from the left corner.\" Another\r\npicture is the Vale of Ashburnham, with the house in the middle\r\ndistance, Beachy Head beyond, and in the foreground woodcutters carrying\r\nwood in an ox waggon. \"The whole,\" says Mr. Reinagle, A.R.A., \"is\r\nhappily composed, if I may use the term.\" He then adds: \"The eye of the\r\nspectator, on looking at this beautifully painted scene, roves with an\r\neager delight from one hill to another, and seems to play on the dappled\r\nwoods till arrested by the seat of Lord Ashburnham.\" Other pictures in\r\nthe folio are \"Pevensey Bay from Crowhurst Park,\" a very beautiful\r\nscene, \"Battle Abbey,\" and \"The Vale of Heathfield,\" painted from a\r\npoint above the road, with Heathfield House on the left, the tower on\r\nthe right, the church in the centre in the middle distance, and the sea\r\non the horizon: an impressive but not strictly veracious landscape.\r\n\r\nIn Brightling church is a bust to John Fuller, with the motto: \"Utile\r\nnihil quod non honestum.\" A rector in Fuller's early days was William\r\nHayley, who died in 1789, a zealous antiquary. His papers relating to\r\nthe history of Sussex, are now, like those of Sir William Burrell, in\r\nthe British Museum.\r\n\r\nOur next village is Burwash, three miles in the north, built, like all\r\nthe villages in this switchback district, on a hill. We are now,\r\nindeed, well in the heart of the fatiguing country which we touched at\r\nMayfield, where one eminence is painfully won only to reveal another.\r\nOne can be as parched on a road in the Sussex hop country as in the\r\nArabian desert. The eye, however, that is tired of hop poles and hills\r\ncan find sweet gratification in the cottages. Sussex has charming\r\ncottages from end to end of her territory, but I think the hop district\r\non the Kentish side has some of the prettiest. Blackberries too may be\r\nset down among the riches of the sand-hill villages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUPERSTITIONS]\r\n\r\nIn Richard Jefferies' essay, \"The Country-side: Sussex\" (in _Field and\r\nHedgerow_), describing this district of the country, is an amusing\r\npassage touching superstitions of these parts, picked up during hopping:\r\n\r\n\"In and about the kiln I learned that if you smash a frog with a stone,\r\nno matter how hard you hit him, he cannot die till sunset. You must be\r\ncareful not to put on any new article of clothing for the first time on\r\na Saturday, or some severe punishment will ensue. One person put on his\r\nnew boots on a Saturday, and on Monday broke his arm. Some still believe\r\nin herbs, and gather wood-betony for herb tea, or eat dandelion leaves\r\nbetween slices of dry toast. There is an old man living in one of the\r\nvillages who has reached the age of a hundred and sixty years, and still\r\ngoes hop-picking. Ever so many people had seen him, and knew all about\r\nhim; an undoubted fact, a public fact; but I could not trace him to his\r\nlair. His exact whereabouts could not be fixed. I live in hopes of\r\nfinding him in some obscure 'Hole' yet (many little hamlets are 'Holes,'\r\nas Froghole, Foxhole). What an exhibit for London! Did he realise his\r\nown value, he would soon come forth. I joke, but the existence of this\r\nantique person is firmly believed in.\"\r\n\r\nBurwash is one of the few Sussex villages that has been made the subject\r\nof a book. The Rev. John Coker Egerton's _Sussex Folk and Sussex Ways_\r\n(from which I have already occasionally quoted) was written here,\r\naround materials collected during the author's period as rector of\r\nBurwash. Mr. Egerton was curate of Burwash from 1857 to 1862, and from\r\n1865 to 1867, when he became rector and remained in the living until his\r\ndeath in 1888. His book is a kindly collection of the shrewd and\r\nhumorous sayings of his Sussex parishioners, anecdotes of characteristic\r\nincidents, records of old customs now passing or passed away--the whole\r\nfused by the rector's genial personality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PARTY POLITICS]\r\n\r\nIt is to Burwash and Mr. Egerton that we owe some characteristic scraps\r\nof Sussex philosophy. Thus, Mr. Egerton tells of an old conservative\r\nwhose advice to young men was this: \"Mind you don't never have nothing\r\nin no way to do with none of their new-fangled schemes.\" Another Sussex\r\ncynic defined party government with grim impartiality: \"Politics are\r\nabout like this: I've got a sow in my yard with twelve little uns, and\r\nthey little uns can't all feed at once, because there isn't room enough;\r\nso I shut six on 'em out of the yard while tother six be sucking, and\r\nthe six as be shut out, they just do make a hem of a noise till they be\r\nlet in; and then they be just as quiet as the rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the Sussex man to put his foot down and keep it there,\r\nis shown in the refusal of Burwash to ring the bells when George IV.,\r\nthen Prince of Wales, passed through the village on his return to\r\nBrighton from a visit to Sir John Lade at Etchingham; the reason given\r\nbeing that the First Gentleman in Europe when rung in on his way to Sir\r\nJohn's had said nothing about beer. This must have been during one of\r\nthe Prince's peculiarly needy periods, for the withholding of strong\r\ndrink from his friends was never one of his failings. Another Burwash\r\nradical used to send up to the rectory with a message that he was about\r\nto gather fruit and the rector must send down for the tithe. The\r\nrector's man would go down--and receive one gooseberry from a basket of\r\nten: all that was to be gathered that day.\r\n\r\nAnother Burwash man posed his vicar more agreeably and humorously in\r\nanother manner. Finding him a little in liquor the pastor would have\r\nwarned him against the habit, but the man was too quick. How was it, he\r\nasked the vicar with well affected or real concern, that whenever he had\r\nhad too much to drink he felt more religious than at any other time?\r\n\r\nThe Burwash records indeed go far to redeem Sussex men from the epithet\r\n\"silly,\" which is traditionally theirs. Concerning this old taunt, I\r\nlike the rector's remarks in _Idlehurst_. The phrase, he says, \"is\r\nbetter after all than 'canny owd Cummerlan'' or calling ourselves 'free\r\nand enlightened citizens' or 'heirs to all the ages.' But suppose Sussex\r\nas silly as you like, the country wants a large preserve of fallow\r\nbrains; you can't manure the intellect for close cropping. Isn't it\r\nRenan who attributes so much to solid Breton stupidity in his\r\nancestors?\" I notice that Mr. H. G. Wells, in his very interesting book,\r\n_Mankind in the Making_, is in support of this suggestion. The\r\n_Idlehurst_ rector, in contrasting Londoners with Sussex folk,\r\ncontinues: \"The Londoner has all his strength in the front line: one can\r\nnever tell what reserves the countryman may not deploy in his slow way.\"\r\n(Some old satirist of the county had it that the crest of the true\r\nSussex peasant is a pig couchant, with the motto \"I wunt be druv.\" I\r\ngive this for what it is worth.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUSSEX RESERVES]\r\n\r\nIt is to be doubted if any county has a monopoly of silliness. The fault\r\nof Sussex people rather is to lack reserves, not of wisdom but of\r\neffort. You see this in cricket, where although the Sussex men have done\r\nsome of the most brilliant things in the history of the game (even\r\nbefore the days of their Oriental ally), they have probably made a\r\ngreater number of tame attempts to cope with difficulties than any other\r\neleven. For the \"staying of a rot\" Sussex has had but few\r\nqualifications. The cricket test is not everything: but character tells\r\nthere just as in any other employment. Burwash, however, must be\r\nexempted from this particular charge, for, whatever its form may be\r\nnow, its eleven had once a terrible reputation. I find in the county\r\npaper for 1771 an advertisement to the effect that Burwash, having\r\n\"challenged all its neighbours without effect,\" invites a match with any\r\nparish whatsoever in all Sussex.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE DONKEY RACE]\r\n\r\nMr. Egerton was not the first parson to record the manners of the\r\nBurwash parishioner. The Rev. James Hurdis, curate there towards the end\r\nof the preceding century, and afterwards Professor of Poetry at Oxford\r\n(we saw his grave at Bishopstone), had written a blank verse poem in the\r\nmanner of Cowper, with some of the observation of Crabbe, entitled \"The\r\nVillage Curate,\" which is a record of his thoughts and impressions in\r\nhis Burwash days. One could hardly say that \"The Village Curate\" would\r\nbear reprinting at the present time; we have moved too far from its\r\npensiveness, and an age that does not read \"The Task\" and only talks\r\nabout Crabbe is hardly likely to reach out for Hurdis. But within its\r\nlimits \"The Village Curate\" is good, alike in its description of\r\nscenery, its reflections and its satire. The Burwash donkey race is\r\ncapital:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Then comes the ass-race. Let not wisdom frown,\r\n     If the grave clerk look on, and now and then\r\n     Bestow a smile; for we may see, Alcanor,\r\n     In this untoward race the ways of life.\r\n     Are we not asses all? We start and run,\r\n     And eagerly we press to pass the goal,\r\n     And all to win a bauble, a lac'd hat.\r\n     Was not great Wolsey such? He ran the race,\r\n     And won the hat. What ranting politician,\r\n     What prating lawyer, what ambitious clerk,\r\n     But is an ass that gallops for a hat?\r\n     For what do Princes strive, but golden hats?\r\n     For diadems, whose bare and scanty brims\r\n     Will hardly keep the sunbeam from their eyes.\r\n     For what do Poets strive? A leafy hat,\r\n     Without or crown or brim, which hardly screens\r\n     The empty noddle from the fist of scorn,\r\n     Much less repels the critic's thund'ring arm.\r\n     And here and there intoxication too\r\n     Concludes the race. Who wins the hat, gets drunk.\r\n     Who wins a laurel, mitre, cap, or crown,\r\n     Is drunk as he. So Alexander fell,\r\n     So Haman, Cæsar, Spenser, Wolsey, James.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A STRATEGIC DUELLIST]\r\n\r\nI find in the Sussex paper for 1792 the following contribution to the\r\nhistory of Burwash: \"A Hint to Great and Little Men.--Last Thursday\r\nmorning a butcher and a shopkeeper of Burwash, in this County, went into\r\na field near that town, with pistols, to decide a quarrel of long\r\nstanding between them. The lusty Knight of the Cleaver having made it a\r\npractice to insult his antagonist, who is a very little man, the great\r\ndisparity between them in size rendered this the only eligible\r\nalternative for the latter. The butcher took care to inform his wife of\r\nthe intended meeting, in hopes that she would give the Constables timely\r\nnotice thereof. But the good woman not having felt so deeply interested\r\nin his fate as he expected, to make sure, he sent to the Constable\r\nhimself, and then marched reluctantly to the field, where the little,\r\nspirited shopkeeper was parading with a considerable reserve of\r\nammunition, lest his first fire should not take place. Now the\r\naffrighted butcher proceeded slowly to charge his pistols, alternately\r\nlooking towards the town and his impatient adversary. This man of blood,\r\nall pale and trembling, at last began to despair of any friendly\r\ninterference, when the Constable very seasonably appeared and forbade\r\nthe duel, to his great joy, and the disappointment of the spectators.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HENRY BURWASH]\r\n\r\nBurwash had another great man of whom it is not very proud. Fuller shall\r\ndescribe him:--\"Henry Burwash, so named, saith my Author[3] (which is\r\nenough for my discharge) from _Burwash_, a Town in this County. He was\r\none of _Noble Alliance_. And when this is said, _all is said_ to his\r\ncommendation, being otherwise neither good for Church nor State,\r\nSoveraign nor Subjects; Covetous, Ambitious, Rebellious, Injurious.\r\n\r\n\"Say not, _what makes he here then amongst the worthies_? For though\r\nneither _Ethically_ nor _Theologically_, yet _Historically_ he was\r\nremarkable, affording something for our _Information_ though not\r\n_Imitation_.\r\n\r\n\"He was recommended by his kinsman _Bartholomew de Badilismer_ (Baron of\r\n_Leeds_ in _Kent_) to King _Edward_ the second, who preferred him Bishop\r\nof _Lincoln_. It was not long before, falling into the King's\r\ndispleasure, his _Temporalities_ were seized on, and afterwards on his\r\nsubmission restored. Here, instead of new _Gratitude_, retayning his old\r\n_Grudge_, he was most forward to assist the Queen in the deposing of her\r\nhusband. He was twice Lord Treasurer, once Chancellor, and once sent\r\nover Ambassador to the _Duke of Bavaria_. He died _Anno Domini_ 1340.\r\n\r\n\"Such as mind to be merry may read the pleasant Story of his apparition,\r\nbeing condemned after Death to be _viridis viridarius, a green\r\nForrester_ because in his life-time he had violently inclosed other\r\nmen's Grounds into his Park. Surely such Fictions keep up the _best Park\r\nof Popery (Purgatory)_, whereby their _fairest Game_ and greatest Gaine\r\nis preserved.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Shoyswell, near Ticehurst._]\r\n\r\nEtchingham, the station next Robertsbridge, is famous for its church\r\nwindows, and its brasses to the Etchinghams of the past, an illustrious\r\nrace of Sussex barons. Among the brasses is that of William de\r\nEtchingham, builder of the church, who died in 1345. The inscription, in\r\nFrench, runs:--\"I was made and formed of Earth; and now I have returned\r\nto Earth. William de Etchingham was my name. God have pity on my soul;\r\nand all you who pass by, pray to Him for me.\" Certainly no church in\r\nSussex has so many interesting brasses as these. A moat once surrounded\r\nthe God's acre, and legend had it that at the bottom was a great bell\r\nwhich might never be drawn forth until six yoke of white oxen were\r\nharnessed to it. Pity that the moat was allowed to run dry and the\r\nharmless fiction exposed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A WAGER]\r\n\r\nSir John Lade, diminutive associate of George IV. in his young days (and\r\nafterwards, coming upon disaster, coachman to the Earl of Anglesey),\r\nonce lived at Haremere Hall, near by. As we have seen, the First\r\nGentleman in Europe visited him there, and it was there one day, that,\r\nin default of other quarry, Sir John's gamekeeper only being able to\r\nproduce a solitary pheasant, the Prince and his host shot ten geese as\r\nthey swam across a pond, and laid them at the feet of Lady Lade. Sir\r\nJohn was the hero of the following exploit, recorded in the press in\r\nOctober, 1795:--\"A curious circumstance occurred at Brighton on Monday\r\nse'nnight. Sir John Lade, for a trifling wager, undertook to carry Lord\r\nCholmondeley on his back, from opposite the Pavilion twice round the\r\nSteine. Several ladies attended to be spectators of this extraordinary\r\nfeat of the dwarf carrying the giant. When His Lordship declared himself\r\nready, Sir John desired him to strip. 'Strip!' exclaimed the other; 'why\r\nsurely you promised to carry me in my clothes!' 'By no means,' replied\r\nthe Baronet; 'I engaged to carry _you_, but not an inch of clothes. So,\r\ntherefore, My Lord, make ready, and let us not disappoint the ladies.'\r\nAfter much laughable altercation, it was at length decided that Sir John\r\nhad won his wager, the Peer declining to exhibit _in puris\r\nnaturalibus_.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE HAWKHURST GANG]\r\n\r\nTicehurst and Wadhurst, which may be reached either by road or rail from\r\nRobertsbridge or Etchingham, both stand high, very near the Kentish\r\nborder. To the east of Hurst Green on the road thither (a hamlet\r\ndisproportionate and imposing, possessing, in the George Inn, a relic of\r\nthe days when the coaches came this way), is Seacox Heath, now the\r\nresidence of Lord Goschen, but once the home of George Gray, a member of\r\nthe terrible Hawkhurst gang of smugglers. Ticehurst has a noble church,\r\nvery ingeniously restored, with a square tower, some fine windows, old\r\nglass, a vestry curiously situated over the porch, and an interesting\r\nbrass.\r\n\r\nThe Bell Inn, in the village, is said to date from the fifteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAt Wadhurst are many iron grave slabs and a graceful slender spire. The\r\nmassive door bears the date 1682. A high village, in good accessible\r\ncountry, discovery seems to be upon it. London is not so near as at\r\nCrowborough; but one may almost hear the jingling of the cabs.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[3] Weever's _Funeral Monuments_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nTUNBRIDGE WELLS\r\n\r\n     Over the border--The beginnings of the wells--Tunbridge Wells\r\n     to-day--Mr. George Meredith--The Toad and other\r\n     rocks--Eridge--Trespassing in Sussex--Saxonbury--Bayham\r\n     Abbey--Lamberhurst--Withyham--The Sackvilles--A domestic\r\n     autocrat--\"To all you ladies now on land\"--Withyham church--The\r\n     Sackville monument--John Waylett--Beer and bells--Parish\r\n     expenses--Buckhurst and Old Buckhurst--Ashdown Forest--Hartfield\r\n     and Bolebroke--A wild region.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have made Tunbridge Wells our last centre, because it is convenient;\r\nyet as a matter of strict topography, the town is not in Sussex at all,\r\nbut in Kent.\r\n\r\nIn that it is builded upon hills, Tunbridge Wells is like Rome, and in\r\nthat its fashionable promenade is under the limes, like Berlin; but in\r\nother respects it is merely a provincial English inland pleasure town\r\nwith a past: rather arid, and except under the bracing conditions of\r\ncold weather, very tiring in its steepnesses. No wonder the small\r\nvictoria and smaller pony carriage so flourish there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Pantiles, Tunbridge Wells._]\r\n\r\nThe healthful properties of Tunbridge Wells were discovered, as I record\r\na little later, in 1606; but it was not until Henrietta Maria brought\r\nher suite hither in 1630 that the success of the new cure was assured.\r\nAfterwards came Charles II. and his Court, and Tunbridge Wells was made;\r\nand thenceforward to fail to visit the town at the proper time each year\r\n(although one had the poorest hut to live in the while) was to write\r\none's self down a boor. A more sympathetic patron was Anne, who gave\r\nthe first stone basin for the spring--hence \"Queen's Well\"--and whose\r\nsubscription of _£_100 led to the purchase of the pantiles that paved the\r\nwalk now bearing that name. Subsequently it was called the Parade, but\r\nto the older style everyone has very sensibly reverted.\r\n\r\nTunbridge Wells is still a health resort, but the waters no longer\r\nconstitute a part of the hygienic routine. Their companion element, air,\r\nis the new recuperative. Not that the spring at the foot of the Pantiles\r\nis wholly deserted: on the contrary, the presiding old lady does quite a\r\nbusiness in filling and cleaning the little glasses; but those visitors\r\nthat descend her steps are impelled rather by curiosity than ritual, and\r\nmany never try again. Nor is the trade in Tunbridge ware, inlaid work in\r\ncoloured woods, what it was. A hundred years ago there was hardly a girl\r\nof any pretensions to good form but kept her pins in a Tunbridge box.\r\n\r\nThe Pantiles are still the resort of the idle, but of the anonymous\r\nrather than famous variety. Our men of mark and great Chams of\r\nLiterature, who once flourished here in the season, go elsewhere for\r\ntheir recreation and renovation--abroad for choice. Tunbridge Wells now\r\ndraws them no more than Bath. But in the eighteenth century a large\r\nprint was popular containing the portraits of all the illustrious\r\nintellectuals as they lounged on the Pantiles, with Dr. Johnson and Mr.\r\nSamuel Richardson among the chief lions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE DUVIDNEY LADIES]\r\n\r\nThe residential districts of Tunbridge Wells--its Mounts, Pleasant, Zion\r\nand Ephraim, with their discreet and prosperous villas--suggest to me\r\nonly Mr. Meredith's irreproachable Duvidney ladies. In one of these\r\nwell-ordered houses must they have lived and sighed over Victor's\r\ntangled life--surrounded by laurels and laburnum; the lawn either cut\r\nyesterday or to be cut to-day; the semicircular drive a miracle of\r\ngravel unalloyed; a pan of water for Tasso beside the dazzling step.\r\nReceding a hundred years, the same author peoples Tunbridge Wells again,\r\nfor it was here, in its heyday, that Chloe suffered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROCKS]\r\n\r\nOn Rusthall Common is the famous Toad Rock, which is to Tunbridge Wells\r\nwhat Thorwaldsen's lion is to Lucerne, and the Leaning Tower to Pisa.\r\nLucerne's lion emerged from the stone under the sculptor's mallet and\r\nchisel, but the Rusthall monster was evolved by natural processes, and\r\nit is a toad only by courtesy. An inland rock is, however, to most\r\nEnglish people so rare an object that Rusthall has almost as many\r\npilgrims as Stonehenge. The Toad is free; the High Rocks, however, which\r\nare a mile distant, cannot be inspected by the curious for less than\r\nsixpence. One must pass through a turnstile before these wonders are\r\naccessible. Rocks in themselves having insufficient drawing power, as\r\nthe dramatic critics say, a maze has been added, together with swings, a\r\nseesaw, arbours, a croquet lawn, and all the proper adjuncts of a\r\nnatural phenomenon. The effect is to make the rocks appear more unreal\r\nthan any rocks ever seen upon the stage. Freed from their\r\npleasure-garden surroundings they would become beautifully wild and\r\nromantic and tropically un-English; but as it is, with their notice\r\nboards and bridges, they are disappointing, except of course to\r\nchildren. They are no disappointment to children; indeed, they go far to\r\nmake Tunbridge Wells a children's wonderland. There is no kind of\r\ndramatic game to which the High Rocks would not make the best\r\nbackground. Finer rocks, because more remote and free from labels and\r\ntea rooms, are those known as Penn's Rocks, three miles in the\r\nsouth-west, in a beautiful valley.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SAXONBURY]\r\n\r\nEridge, whither all visitors to Tunbridge Wells must at one time or\r\nanother drive, is the seat of the Marquis of Abergavenny, whose imposing\r\nA, tied, like a dressing gown, with heavy tassels, is embossed on every\r\ncottage for miles around. In character the park resembles Ashburnham,\r\nwhile in extent it vies with the great parks of the south-west, Arundel,\r\nGoodwood and Petworth; but it has none of their spacious coolnesses. Yet\r\nEridge Park has joys that these others know not of--brake fern four feet\r\nhigh, and the conical hill on which stands Saxonbury Tower, jealously\r\nguarded from the intruding traveller by the stern fiat of \"Mr. Macbean,\r\nsteward.\" Sussex is a paradise of notice boards (there is a little\r\ndistrict near Forest Row where the staple industry must be the\r\nprosecuting of trespassers), and one has come ordinarily to look upon\r\nthese monitions without active resentment; but when the Caledonian\r\ndescends from his native heath to warn the Sussex man off Sussex\r\nground--more, to warn the Saxon from his own bury--the situation becomes\r\nacute. By taking, however, the precaution of asking at a not too\r\nadjacent cottage for permission to ascend the hill, one may circumvent\r\nthe Scottish prosecutor.\r\n\r\nThe hill is very important ground in English history, as the following\r\npassage from Sir William Burrell's MSS. in the British Museum\r\ntestifies:--\"In Eridge Park are the remains of a military station of the\r\nSaxon invaders of the country, which still retains the name of Saxonbury\r\nHill. It is on the high ground to the right, as the traveller passes\r\nfrom Frant to Mayfield. On the summit of this hill (from whence the\r\ncliffs of Dover may be seen) are to be traced the remains of an ancient\r\nfortification; the fosse is still plainly discernible, enclosing an area\r\nof about two acres, from whence there is but one outlet. The apex of the\r\nhill within is formed of a strong compact body of stone, brought hither\r\nfrom a distance, on which doubtless was erected some strong military\r\nedifice. This was probably one of the stations occupied by the Saxons\r\nunder Ella, their famous chief, who, at the instance of Hengist, King of\r\nKent, invaded England towards the close of the fifth century. It is said\r\nthat they settled in Sussex, whence they issued in force to attack the\r\nimportant British station of Anderida or Andredceaster. Antiquaries are\r\nnot agreed as to the precise situation of this military station; some\r\nimagining it to have been at Newenden, on the borders of Kent; others at\r\nPevensey, or Hastings, in Sussex. The country, from the borders of Kent\r\nto those of Hampshire, comprises what was called the Forest of\r\nAndredsweald, now commonly called the Weald, was formerly full of strong\r\nholds and fastnesses, and was consequently well calculated for the\r\nretreat of the ancient Britons from before the regular armies of the\r\nRomans, as well as for the establishment of points of attack by the\r\nsucceeding invaders who coped with them on terms somewhat reversed. The\r\nattack of the Saxons on Anderida was successful, and the consequence was\r\ntheir permanent establishment in Sussex and Surrey, from which time they\r\nprobably retained a military station on this hill.\r\n\r\n\"There is likewise within the park a place called Danes Gate. This was\r\ndoubtless a part of a military way; and as it would happen that the last\r\nsuccessful invaders would occupy the same strong posts which had been\r\nformed by their predecessors, this Danes Gate was probably the military\r\ncommunication between Crowborough, undoubtedly a Danish station, and\r\nSaxonbury Hill.\"\r\n\r\nThe view from Saxonbury extends far in each quarter, embracing both\r\nlines of Downs, North and South. The long low irregular front of Eridge\r\nCastle is two or three miles to the north-west, with its lake before it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LORD NORTH'S DISCOVERY]\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth stayed at Eridge for six days in 1573, on her progress\r\nto Northiam, where we saw her dining and changing her shoes. Lord\r\nBurleigh, who accompanied her, found the country hereabouts dangerous,\r\nand \"worse than in the Peak.\" It was another of the guests at Eridge\r\nthat made Tunbridge Wells; for had not Dudley, Lord North, when\r\nrecuperating there in 1606, discovered that the (Devil-flavoured)\r\nchalybeate water of the neighbourhood was beneficial, the spring would\r\nnot have been enclosed nor would other of London's fatigued young bloods\r\nhave drunk of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bayham Abbey._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BAYHAM ABBEY]\r\n\r\nEnough remains of Bayham Abbey, five miles south-east of Tunbridge\r\nWells, to show that it was once a very considerable monastery. The\r\nfounder was Sir Robert de Turneham, one of the knights of Richard\r\nCoeur de Lion, famous for cracking many crowns with his \"fauchion,\"\r\nand the founder also of Combwell Abbey at Goudhurst, not far distant.\r\nEdward I. and Edward II. were both entertained at Bayham, while a\r\nfortunate visit from St. Richard, Bishop of Chichester, put the Abbey in\r\npossession of a bed (on which he had slept) which cured all them that\r\nafterwards lay in it. Between Bayham and Goudhurst is Lamberhurst, on\r\nthe boundary. (The church and part of the street are indeed in Kent.)\r\nLamberhurst's boast is that its furnaces were larger than any in Sussex;\r\nand that they made the biggest guns. The old iron railings around St.\r\nPaul's are said to have come from the Lamberhurst iron works--2,500 in\r\nall, each five feet six inches in height, with seven gates. The\r\nLamberhurst cannon not only served England, but some, it is whispered,\r\nfound their way to French privateers and were turned against their\r\nnative land.\r\n\r\nSweetest of spots in the neighbourhood of Tunbridge Wells is Withyham,\r\nin the west, lying to the north of Ashdown Forest, a small and retired\r\nvillage, with a charming church, a good inn (the Dorset Arms), Duckings,\r\na superb piece of old Sussex architecture, Old Buckhurst, an interesting\r\nruin, new Buckhurst's magnificent park, and some of the best country in\r\nthe county. Once the South Down district is left behind I think that\r\nWithyham is the jewel of Sussex. Moreover, the proximity of the wide\r\nhigh spaces of Ashdown Forest seems to have cleared the air; no longer\r\nis one conscious of the fatigue that appertains to the triangular hill\r\ndistrict between Tunbridge Wells, Robertsbridge and Uckfield.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SPLENDID SACKVILLES]\r\n\r\nWithyham is notable historically for its association with the great and\r\nsumptuous Sackville family, which has held Buckhurst since Henry II.,\r\nand of which the principal figure is Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst,\r\nfirst Earl of Dorset, who was born here in 1536, Queen Elizabeth's Lord\r\nTreasurer and part author of _Gorboduc_. After him came Robert\r\nSackville, second earl, who founded Sackville College at East Grinstead;\r\nand then Richard, the third earl, famous for the luxury in which he\r\nlived at Knole in Kent and Dorset House in London. Among this nobleman's\r\nretinue was a first footman rejoicing (I hope) in the superlatively\r\nsuitable name of Acton Curvette: a name to write a comedy around.\r\nRichard Sackville, the fifth earl, was a more domestic peer, of whom we\r\nhave some intimate and amusing glimpses in the memorandum books and\r\ndiaries which he kept at Knole. Thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Hy. Mattock for scolding to extremity on Sunday 12th\r\n     October 1661 without cause                                  0 0 3\r\n\r\n     \"Hy. Mattock for disposing of my Cast linnen without my\r\n     order                                                       0 0 3\r\n\r\n     \"Robert Verrell for giving away my money                    0 0 6\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"TO ALL YOU LADIES\"]\r\n\r\nLastly we come to Charles Sackville, sixth earl, that Admirable\r\nCrichton, the friend of Charles II. and the patron of poets, who spent\r\nthe night before an engagement in the Dutch war in writing the sprightly\r\nverses, \"To all you ladies now on land,\" wherein occurs this agreeable\r\nfancy:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Then, if we write not by each post,\r\n       Think not we are unkind;\r\n     Nor yet conclude our ships are lost\r\n       By Dutchmen or by wind;\r\n     Our tears we'll send a speedier way:\r\n     The tide shall bring them twice a day.\r\n\r\n     The king with wonder and surprise,\r\n       Will swear the seas grow bold;\r\n     Because the tides will higher rise\r\n       Than e'er they did of old:\r\n     But let him know it is our tears\r\n     Bring floods of grief to Whitehall-stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the sixth Earl of Dorset's monument in Withyham Church is inscribed\r\nPope's epitaph, beginning:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Dorset, the grace of Courts, the Muses pride,\r\n     Patron of arts, and judge of nature dy'd!\r\n     The scourge of pride, though sanctify'd or great,\r\n     Of fops in learning, and of knaves in state:\r\n     Yet soft his nature, though severe his lay,\r\n     His anger moral, and his wisdom gay.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe church is very prettily situated on a steep mound, at the western\r\nfoot of which is a sheet of water; at the eastern foot, the village. So\r\nhidden by trees is it that approaching Withyham from Hartfield one is\r\nunconscious of its proximity. The glory of the church is the monument,\r\nin the Sackville Chapel, to Thomas Sackville, youngest son of the fifth\r\nEarl of Dorset. There is nothing among the many tombs which we have\r\nseen more interesting than this, although for charm it is not to be\r\ncompared with, say, the Shurley monument at Isfield. The young man\r\nreclines on the tomb; at one side of him is the figure of his father,\r\nand at the other, of his mother, both life-like and life-size, dressed\r\nin their ordinary style. The attitudes being extremely natural the total\r\neffect is curiously realistic. On the sides of the tomb, in bas-relief,\r\nare the figures of the six brothers and six sisters of the youth, some\r\nquite babies. The sculptor was Caius Cibber, Colley Cibber's father.\r\nOther monuments are also to be seen in the Sackville Chapel, but that\r\nwhich I have described is the finest.\r\n\r\nHad Withyham church not been destroyed by fire, in 1663, in a \"tempest\r\nof thunder and lightning,\" it would now be second to none in Sussex in\r\ninterest and the richness of its tombs; for in that fire perished in the\r\nSackville aisle, now no more, on the northern side, other and perhaps\r\nnobler Sackville monuments. The vaults, where many Sackvilles lie, were\r\nnot however injured. In the Sackville Chapel is a large window recording\r\nthe genealogy of the family, which is now represented by Earl De la\r\nWarr, at the foot of which are the words in Latin, \"The noble family of\r\nSackville here awaits the Resurrection.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JOHN WAYLETT, BELL-FOUNDER]\r\n\r\nWithyham has three of the bells of John Waylett, an itinerant\r\nbell-founder at the beginning of the eighteenth century. His method was\r\nto call on the vicar and ask if anything were wanted; and if a bell was\r\ncracked, or if a new one was desired, he would dig a mould in a\r\nneighbouring field, build a fire, collect his metal and perform the task\r\non the spot. Waylett's business might be called the higher tinkering.\r\nSussex has some forty of his bells. He cast the Steyning peal in 1724,\r\nand earlier in the same year he had made a stay at Lewes, erecting a\r\nfurnace there, as Benvenuto Cellini tells us he used to do, and\r\nremedying defective peals all around. Among others he recast the old\r\ntreble and made a new treble for Mayfield. It seems to have been\r\nuniversally thirsty work: the churchwardens' papers contain an account\r\nfor beer in connection with the enterprise:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEER]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           _£    s.  d._\r\n     For beer to the ringers when the Bell founder was here      2   6\r\n     When the bell was weighed                                   3   6\r\n     When the bell was loaded                                    2   0\r\n     In carrying ye bell to Lewes and back again            1   10   0\r\n     When the bell was waid and hung up                          3   0\r\n     For beer to the officers and several others a\r\n       hanging up ye bell                                       18   0\r\n     In beer to the ringers when ye bell was hung                6   6\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Withyham churchwardens also expended 3_s._ 6_d._ on beer when\r\nWaylett came to spread thirst abroad. I find also among the entries from\r\nthe parish account-book, which Mr. Sutton, the vicar, prints in his\r\n_Historical Notes on Withyham_, a very interesting and informing book,\r\nthe following items:\r\n\r\n\r\n     1711.

The previous home of the\r\nSackvilles was Old Buckhurst in the valley to the west, of which only\r\nthe husk now remains. One can see that the mansion was of enormous\r\nextent; and the walls were so strongly built that when an attempt was\r\nrecently made to destroy and utilise a portion for road mending, the\r\nproject had to be abandoned on account of the hardness of the mortar.\r\nOne beautiful tower (out of six) still stands. An underground passage,\r\nwhich is said variously to lead to the large lake in Buckhurst Park, to\r\nthe church, and to Bolebroke at Hartfield, has never been explored\r\nfarther than the first door that blocks the way; nor have the seven cord\r\nof gold, rumoured to be buried near the house, come to light.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OLD RURAL ARCHITECTURE]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IN PRAISE OF \"DUCKINGS\"]\r\n\r\nIt was of Duckings, the beautiful timbered farmhouse of which Withyham\r\nis justly proud, that Jefferies thus wrote, in his essay on \"Buckhurst\r\nPark\": \"Our modern architects try to make their rooms mathematically\r\nsquare, a series of brick boxes, one on the other like pigeon-holes in a\r\nbureau, with flat ceilings and right angles in the corners, and are said\r\nto go through a profound education before they can produce these\r\nwonderful specimens of art. If our old English folk could not get an\r\narched roof, then they loved to have it pointed, with polished timber\r\nbeams in which the eye rested as in looking upwards through a tree.\r\nTheir rooms they liked of many shapes, and not at right angles in the\r\ncorners, nor all on the same dead level of flooring. You had to go up a\r\nstep into one, and down a step into another, and along a winding passage\r\ninto a third, so that each part of the house had its individuality. To\r\nthese houses life fitted itself and grew to them; they were not mere\r\nwalls, but became part of existence. A man's house was not only his\r\ncastle, a man's house was himself. He could not tear himself away from\r\nhis house, it was like tearing up the shrieking mandrake by the root,\r\nalmost death itself. Now we walk in and out of our brick boxes\r\nunconcerned whether we live in this villa or that, here or yonder. Dark\r\nbeams inlaid in the walls support the gables; heavier timber, placed\r\nhorizontally, forms, as it were, the foundation of the first floor. This\r\nhorizontal beam has warped a little in the course of time, the\r\nalternate heat and cold of summers and winters that make centuries. Up\r\nto this beam the lower wall is built of brick set to curve of the\r\ntimber, from which circumstance it would appear to be a modern\r\ninsertion. The beam, we may be sure, was straight originally, and the\r\nbricks have been fitted to the curve which it subsequently took. Time,\r\nno doubt, ate away the lower work of wood, and necessitated the\r\ninsertion of new materials. The slight curve of the great beam adds, I\r\nthink, to the interest of the old place, for it is a curve that has\r\ngrown and was not premeditated; it has grown like the bough of a tree,\r\nnot from any set human design. This, too, is the character of the house.\r\nIt is not large, nor overburdened with gables, not ornamental, nor what\r\nis called striking, in any way, but simply an old English house, genuine\r\nand true. The warm sunlight falls on the old red tiles, the dark beams\r\nlook the darker for the glow of light, the shapely cone of the hop-oast\r\nrises at the end; there are swallows and flowers, and ricks and horses,\r\nand so it is beautiful because it is natural and honest. It is the\r\nsimplicity that makes it so touching, like the words of an old ballad.\r\nNow at Mayfield there is a timber house which is something of a show\r\nplace, and people go to see it, and which certainly has many more lines\r\nin its curves and woodwork, but yet did not appeal to me, because it\r\nseemed too purposely ornamental. A house designed to look well, even age\r\nhas not taken from its artificiality. Neither is there any cone nor\r\ncart-horses about. Why, even a tall chanticleer makes a home look\r\nhomely. I do like to see a tall proud chanticleer strutting in the yard\r\nand barely giving way as I advance, almost ready to do battle with a\r\nstranger like a mastiff. So I prefer the simple old home by Buckhurst\r\nPark.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ASHDOWN FOREST]\r\n\r\nThe forest of which Ashdown Forest was a part extended once in unbroken\r\nsombre density from Kent to Hampshire, a distance of 120 miles. It was\r\nknown to the Romans as Sylva Anderida, giving its name to Anderida (or\r\nPevensey) on the edge of it; to the Saxons it was Andreaswald. Wolves,\r\nwild boar and deer then roamed its dark recesses. Our Ashdown\r\nForest--all that now remains of this wild track--was for long a Royal\r\nhunting ground. Edward III. granted it to John of Gaunt, who, there's no\r\ndoubt, often came hither for sport. It is supposed that he built a\r\nchapel near Nutley (\"Chapel Wood\" marks the site) where, on one occasion\r\nat least, John Wycliffe the reformer officiated. At Forest Row, as we\r\nhave seen, the later lords who hunted here built their lodges and kept\r\ntheir retainers. There are no longer any deer in the Forest; the modern\r\nsportsman approaches it with a cleek where his forerunner carried a bow.\r\nA hundred years ago, in the smuggling days, it was a very dangerous\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ashdown Forest, from East Grinstead._]\r\n\r\nHartfield, the village next to Withyham in the west, is uninteresting;\r\nbut it has a graceful church, and at Bolebroke, once the home of the\r\nDalyngruges, whom we met at Bodiam, and later of the Sackvilles, are the\r\nremains of a noble brick mansion. The towered gateway still stands, and\r\nit is not difficult to reconstruct in the mind's eye the house in its\r\nbest period. Of old cottage architecture Hartfield also has a pretty\r\nexample in Lych-Gate Cottage, by the churchyard. \"Castle field,\" north\r\nof the village, probably marks the site of an ancient castle, or hunting\r\nlodge, of the Barons of Pevensey. That there was good hunting in these\r\nparts the name Hartfield itself goes to prove.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OUR JOURNEY'S END]\r\n\r\nBetween Withyham and Hartfield in the north, and Crowborough Beacon and\r\nWych Cross in the south, is some of the finest open country in Sussex,\r\nwhere one may walk for hours and meet no human creature. Here are silent\r\ndesolate woods--the Five Hundred Acre Wood, under Crowborough, chief of\r\nthem--and vast wastes of undulating heath, rising here and there to\r\ngreat heights crowned with fir trees, as at Gill's Lap. A few enclosed\r\nestates interrupt the forest's open freedom, but nothing can tame it.\r\nSombre dark heather gives the prevailing note, but between Old Lodge and\r\nPippinford Park I once came upon a green and luxuriant valley that would\r\nnot have been out of place in Tyrol; while there is a field near Chuck\r\nHatch where in April one may see more dancing daffodils than ever\r\nWordsworth did.\r\n\r\nAnd here we leave the county.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nTHE SUSSEX DIALECT\r\n\r\n     French words at Hastings and Rye--Saxon on the farms--Mr. W. D.\r\n     Parish's _Dictionary of the Sussex Dialect_--The rules of the\r\n     game--The raciest of the words--A Sussex criticism of Disraeli--The\r\n     gender of a Sussex nose--A shepherd's adventures--Sussex words in\r\n     America--\"The Song of Solomon\" in the Sussex vernacular.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe body of the Sussex dialect is derived from the Saxon. Its\r\naccessories can be traced to the Celts, to the Norse--thus _rape_, a\r\ndivision of the county, is probably an adaptation of the Icelandic\r\n_hreppr_--and to the French, some hundreds of Huguenots having fled to\r\nour shores after the Edict of Nantes. The Hastings fishermen, for\r\nexample, often say _boco_ for plenty, and _frap_ to strike; while in the\r\nRye neighbourhood, where the Huguenots were strongest, such words as\r\n_dishabil_ meaning untidy, undressed, and _peter grievous_ (from\r\n_petit-grief_) meaning fretful, are still used.\r\n\r\nBut Saxon words are, of course, considerably more common. You meet them\r\nat every turn. A Sussex auctioneer's list that lies before me--a\r\ncatalogue of live and dead farming stock to be sold at a homestead under\r\nthe South Downs--is full of them. So blunt and sturdy they are, these\r\nancient primitive terms of the soil: \"Lot 1. Pitch prong, two half-pitch\r\nprongs, two 4-speen spuds, and a road hoe. Lot 5. Five short prongs,\r\nflint spud, dung drag, two turnip pecks, and two shovels. Lot 9. Six hay\r\nrakes, two scythes and sneaths, cross-cut saw, and a sheep hook. Lot 39.\r\nCorn chest, open tub, milking stool, and hog form. Lot 43. Bushel\r\nmeasure, shaul and strike. Lot 100. Rick borer. Lot 143. Eight knaves\r\nand seven felloes. Lot 148. Six dirt boards and pair of wood hames. Lot\r\n152. Wheelwright's sampson. Lot 174. Set of thill harness. Lot 201.\r\nThree plough bolts, three tween sticks. Lot 204. Sundry harness and\r\nwhippances. Lot 208. Tickle plough. Lot 222. Iron turnwrist [pronounced\r\nturn-riced] plough. Lot 242. 9-time scarifier. Lot 251. Clod crusher.\r\nLot 252. Hay tedder.\" From another catalogue more ram=alogues, these\r\nabrupt and active little words might be called, butt at one. As \"Lot 4.\r\nFlint spud, two drain scoops, bull lead and five dibbles. Lot 10. Dung\r\nrake and dung devil. Lot 11. Four juts and a zinc skip.\" Farm labourers\r\nare men of little speech, and it is often needful that voices should\r\ncarry far. Hence this crisp and forcible reticence. The vocabulary of\r\nthe country-side undergoes few changes; and the noises to-day made by\r\nthe ox-herd who urges his black and smoking team along the hill-side are\r\nprecisely those that Piers Plowman himself would have used.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SAXON PERSISTENT]\r\n\r\nAnother survival may be noticed in objurgation. A Sussex man swearing by\r\nJob, as he often does, is not calling in the aid of the patient sufferer\r\nof Uz, but Jobe, the Anglo-Saxon Jupiter.\r\n\r\nA few examples of Sussex speech, mainly drawn from Mr. Parish's\r\n_Dictionary of the Sussex Dialect_ will help to add the true flavour to\r\nthese pages. Mr. Parish's little book is one of the best of its kind;\r\nthat it is more than a contribution to etymology a very few quotations\r\nwill show.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SUSSEX RULES]\r\n\r\nMr. Parish lays down the following general principles of the Sussex\r\ntongue:--\r\n\r\n_a_ before double _d_ becomes _ar_; whereby ladder and adder are\r\npronounced larder and arder.\r\n\r\n_a_ before double _l_ is pronounced like _o_; fallow and tallow become\r\nfoller and toller.\r\n\r\n_a_ before _t_ is expanded into _ea_; rate, mate, plate, gate, are\r\npronounced r[dot above e][dot above a]t, m[dot above e][dot above a]t,\r\npl[dot above e][dot above a]t, g[dot above e][dot above a]t.\r\n\r\n_a_ before _ct_ becomes _e_; as satisfection, for satisfaction.\r\n\r\n_e_ before _ct_ becomes _a_; and affection, effect and neglect are\r\npronounced affaction, effact and neglact.\r\n\r\nDouble _e_ is pronounced as _i_ in such words as sheep, week, called\r\nship and wick; and the sound of double _e_ follows the same rule in fild\r\nfor field.\r\n\r\nHaving pronounced _ee_ as _i_, the Sussex people in the most impartial\r\nmanner pronounce _i_ as _ee_; and thus mice, hive, dive, become meece,\r\nheeve, and deeve.\r\n\r\n_i_ becomes _e_ in pet for pit, spet for spit, and similar words.\r\n\r\n_io_ and _oi_ change places respectively; and violet and violent become\r\nvoilet and voilent, while boiled and spoiled are bioled and spioled.\r\n\r\n_o_ before _n_ is expanded into _oa_ in such words as pony, dont, bone;\r\nwhich are pronounced p[dot above o][dot above a]ny,\r\nd[dot above o][dot above a]nt, b[dot above o][dot above a]n.\r\n\r\n_o_ before _r_ is pronounced as _a_; as carn and marning, for corn and\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n_o_ also becomes _a_ in such words as rad, crass, and crap, for rod,\r\ncross, and crop.\r\n\r\n_ou_ is elongated into _aou_ in words like hound, pound, and mound;\r\npronounced haound, paound, and maound.\r\n\r\nThe final _ow_, as in many other counties, is pronounced er, as foller\r\nfor fallow.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities with regard to the pronunciation of consonants are not\r\nso numerous as those of the vowels, but they are very decided, and seem\r\nto admit of less variation.\r\n\r\nDouble _t_ is always pronounced as _d_; as liddle for little, &c., and\r\nthe _th_ is invariably _d_; thus the becomes _de_; and these, them,\r\ntheirs--dese, dem, deres.\r\n\r\n_d_ in its turn is occasionally changed into _th_; as in fother for\r\nfodder.\r\n\r\nThe final _sp_ in such words as wasp, clasp, and hasp are reversed to\r\nwapse, clapse and hapse.\r\n\r\nWords ending in _st_ have the addition of a syllable in the possessive\r\ncase and the plural, and instead of saying that \"some little birds had\r\nbuilt their nests near the posts of Mr. West's gate,\" a Sussex boy would\r\nsay, \"the birds had built their nestes near the postes of Mr. Westes'\r\ngate.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EAST AND WEST]\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, Sussex has little or no dialect absolutely its own;\r\nfor the country speech of the west is practically that also of\r\nHampshire, and of the east, that of Kent. The dividing line between east\r\nand west, Mr. Cripps of Steyning tells me, is the Adur, once an estuary\r\nof the sea rather than the stream it now is, running far inland and\r\nseparating the two Sussexes with its estranging wave.\r\n\r\nMr. Parish's pages supply the following words and examples of their use,\r\nchosen almost at random:--\r\n\r\nAdone (Have done, Leave off): I am told on good authority that when a\r\nSussex damsel says, \"Oh! do adone,\" she means you to go on; but when she\r\nsays, \"Adone-do,\" you must leave off immediately.\r\n\r\nCrownation (Coronation): \"I was married the day the Crownation was, when\r\nthere was a bullock roasted whole up at Furrel [Firle] Park. I\r\nd[dot above o][dot above a]n't know as ever I eat anything so purty in\r\nall my life; but I never got no further than Furrel cross-ways all\r\nnight, no more didn't a good many.\"\r\n\r\nDentical (Dainty): \"My Master says that this here Prooshian (query\r\nPersian) cat what you gave me is a deal too dentical for a poor man's\r\ncat; he wants one as will catch the meece and keep herself.\"\r\n\r\nDunnamany (I do not know how many): \"There was a dunnamany people come\r\nto see that gurt hog of mine when she was took bad, and they all guv it\r\nin as she was took with the information. We did all as ever we could for\r\nher. There was a bottle of stuff what I had from the doctor, time my leg\r\nwas so bad, and we took and mixed it in with some milk and give it to\r\nher lew warm, but naun as we could give her didn't seem to do her any\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\nForeigner (A stranger; a person who comes from any other county but\r\nSussex): I have often heard it said of a woman in this village, who\r\ncomes from Lincolnshire, that \"she has got such a good notion of work\r\nthat you'd never find out but what she was an Englishwoman, without you\r\nwas to hear her talk.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"FRENCHYS\"]\r\n\r\nFrenchy (A foreigner of any country who cannot speak English, the\r\nnationality being added or not, as the case seems to require): thus an\r\nold fisherman, giving an account of a Swedish vessel which was wrecked\r\non the coast a year or two ago, finished by saying that he thought the\r\nFrench Frenchys, take 'em all in all, were better than the Swedish\r\nFrenchys, for he could make out what they were driving at, but he was\r\nall at sea with the others.\r\n\r\nHeart (Condition; said of ground): \"I've got my garden into pretty good\r\nheart at last, and if so be as there warn't quite so many sparrs and\r\ngreybirds and roberts and one thing and t'other, I dunno but what I\r\nmight get a tidy lot of sass. But there! 'taint no use what ye do as\r\nlong as there's so much varmint about.\"\r\n\r\nHill (The Southdown country is always spoken of as \"The Hill\" by the\r\npeople in the Weald): \"He's gone to the hill, harvesting.\"\r\n\r\nInk-horn (Inkstand): \"Fetch me down de inkhorn, mistus; I be g'wine to\r\nputt my harnd to dis here partition to Parliament. 'Tis agin de Romans,\r\nmistus; for if so be as de Romans gets de upper harnd an us, we shall be\r\nburnded, and bloodshedded, and have our Bibles took away from us, and\r\ndere'll be a hem set out.\"\r\n\r\nJustabout (Certainly, extremely): \"I justabout did enjoy myself up at\r\nthe Cristial Palace on the Forresters' day, but there was a terr'ble\r\ngurt crowd; I should think there must have been two or three hundred\r\npeople a-scrouging about.\"\r\n\r\nKnow (Used as a substantive for knowledge): \"Poor fellow, he has got no\r\nknow whatsumdever, but his sister's a nice knowledgeable girl.\"\r\n\r\nLamentable (Very): This word seems to admit of three degrees of\r\ncomparison, which are indicated by the accentuation, thus:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POSITIVE, COMPARATIVE, SUPERLATIVE]\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Positive_--Lamentable (as usually pronounced).\r\n     _Comparative_--Larmentable.\r\n     _Superlative_--Larment[dot above a][dot above a]ble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'Master Chucks,' he says to me says he, ''tis larmentable purty\r\nweather, Master Crockham.' 'Larment[dot above a][dot above a]ble!' says\r\nI.\"\r\n\r\nLarder (Corruption of ladder): \"Master's got a lodge down on the land\r\nyonder, and as I was going across t'other day-morning to fetch a larder\r\nwe keeps there, a lawyer catched holt an me and scratched my face.\"\r\n(Lawyer: A long bramble full of thorns, so called because, \"When once\r\nthey gets a holt on ye, ye d[dot above o][dot above a]nt easy get shut\r\nof 'em.\")\r\n\r\nLeetle (diminutive of little): \"I never see one of these here gurt men\r\nthere's s'much talk about in the p[dot above e][dot above a]pers, only\r\nonce, and that was up at Smiffle Show adunnamany years agoo. Prime\r\nminister, they told me he was, up at Lunnon; a leetle, lear, miserable,\r\nskinny-looking chap as ever I see [Disraeli, I imagine]. 'Why,' I says,\r\n'we d[dot above o][dot above a]n't count our minister to be much, but\r\nhe's a deal primer-looking than what yourn be.'\"\r\n\r\nLoanst (A loan): \"Will you lend mother the loanst of a little tea?\"\r\n\r\nMaster (Pronounced Mass). The distinctive title of a married labourer. A\r\nsingle man will be called by his Christian name all his life long; but a\r\nmarried man, young or old, is \"Master\" even to his most intimate friend\r\nand fellow workmen, as long as he can earn his own livelihood; but as\r\nsoon as he becomes past work he turns into \"the old gentleman,\" leaving\r\nthe bread-winner to rank as master of the household. \"Master\" is quite a\r\ndistinct title from \"Mr.\" which is always pronounced Mus, thus: \"Mus\"\r\nSmith is the employer. \"Master\" Smith is the man he employs. The old\r\ncustom of the wife speaking of her husband as her \"master\" still lingers\r\namong elderly people; but both the word and the reasonableness of its\r\nuse are rapidly disappearing in the present generation. It may be\r\nmentioned here that they say in Sussex that the rosemary will never\r\nblossom except where \"the mistus\" is master.\r\n\r\nMay be and Mayhap (Perhaps). \"May be you knows Mass Pilbeam? No!\r\nd[dot above o][dot above a]n't ye? Well, he was a very sing'lar marn was\r\nMass Pilbeam, a very sing'lar marn! He says to he's mistus one day, he\r\nsays, 'tis a long time, says he, sence I've took a holiday--so cardenly,\r\nnex marnin' he laid abed till purty nigh seven o'clock, and then he\r\nbrackfustes, and then he goos down to the shop and buys fower ounces of\r\nbarca, and he sets hisself down on the maxon, and there he set, and\r\nthere he smoked and smoked and smoked all the whole day long, for, says\r\nhe, 'tis a long time sence I've had a holiday! Ah, he was a very\r\nsing'lar marn--a very sing'lar marn indeed.\"\r\n\r\nQueer (To puzzle): \"It has queered me for a long time to find out who\r\nthat man is; and my mistus she's been quite in a quirk over it. He\r\nd[dot above o][dot above a]nt seem to be quaint with nobody, and he\r\nd[dot above o][dot above a]nt seem to have no business, and for all that\r\nhe's always to and thro', to and thro', for everlastin'.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"MUS REYNOLDS\"]\r\n\r\nReynolds (\"Mus Reynolds\" is the name given to the fox): When I was first\r\ntold that \"Muss Reynolds come along last night\" he was spoken of so\r\nintimately that I supposed he must be some old friend, and expressed a\r\nhope that he had been hospitably received. \"He helped hisself,\" was the\r\nreply; and thereupon followed the explanation, illustrated by an\r\nexhibition of mutilated poultry.\r\n\r\nShort (Tender): A rat-catcher once told me that he knew many people who\r\nwere in the habit of eating barn-fed rats, and he added, \"When they're\r\nin a pudding you could not tell them from a chick, they eat so short and\r\npurty.\"\r\n\r\nShruck (Shrieked): An old woman who was accidentally locked up in a\r\nchurch where she was slumbering in a high pew, said, \"I shruck till I\r\ncould shruck no longer, but no one comed, so I up and tolled upon the\r\nbell.\"\r\n\r\nSpannel (To make dirty foot-marks about a floor, as a spaniel dog\r\ndoes): \"I goos into the kitchen and I says to my mistus, I says ('twas\r\nof a Saddaday), 'the old sow's hem ornary,' I says. 'Well,' says she,\r\n'there ain't no call for you to come spanneling about my clean kitchen\r\nany more for that,' she says; so I goos out and didn't say naun, for you\r\ncan't never make no sense of women-folks of a Saddaday.\"\r\n\r\nSurelye: There are few words more frequently used by Sussex people than\r\nthis. It has no special meaning of its own, but it is added at the end\r\nof any sentence to which particular emphasis is required to be given.\r\n\r\nTedious (Excessive; very): \"I never did see such tedious bad stuff in\r\nall my life.\" Mr. Parish might here be supplemented by the remark that\r\nhis definition explains the use of the word by old Walker, as related by\r\nNyren, when bowling to Lord Frederick Beauclerk, \"Oh,\" he said, \"that\r\nwas tedious near you, my lord.\"\r\n\r\nUnaccountable: A very favourite adjective which does duty on all\r\noccasions in Sussex. A countryman will scarcely speak three sentences\r\nwithout dragging in this word. A friend of mine who had been\r\nremonstrating with one of his parishioners for abusing the parish clerk\r\nbeyond the bounds of neighbourly expression, received the following\r\nanswer:--\"You be quite right, sir; you be quite right. I'd no ought to\r\nhave said what I did, but I d[macron o][macron a]nt mind telling you to\r\nyour head what I've said a many times behind your back.--We've got a\r\ngood shepherd, I says, an axcellent shepherd, but he's got an\r\nunaccountable bad dog!\"\r\n\r\nValiant (Vaillant, French. Stout; well-built): \"What did you think of my\r\nfriend who preached last Sunday, Master Piper?\" \"Ha! he was a valiant\r\nman; he just did stand over the pulpit! Why you b[macron e][macron a]nt\r\nnothing at all to him! See what a noble paunch he had!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"PAUL PODGAM\"]\r\n\r\nYarbs (Herbs): An old man in East Sussex said that many people set much\r\nstore by the doctors, but for his part, he was one for the yarbs, and\r\nPaul Podgam was what he went by. It was not for some time that it was\r\ndiscovered that by Paul Podgam he meant the polypodium fern.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the pleasant passages in Mr. Parish's book. In Mr.\r\nCoker Egerton's _Sussex Folk and Sussex Ways_ is an amusing example of\r\ngender in Sussex. The sun, by the way, is always she or her to the\r\nSussex peasant, as to the German savant; but it is not the only\r\nunexpected feminine in the county. Mr. Egerton gives a conversation in a\r\nvillage school, in which the master bids Tommy blow his nose. A little\r\nlater he returns, and asks Tommy why he has not done so. \"Please, sir, I\r\ndid blow her, but her wouldn't bide blowed.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SHEPHERD'S PERILS]\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing examples Mr. Parish has perhaps made the Sussex\r\nlabourer a thought too epigrammatic: a natural tendency in the\r\nillustrations to such a work. The following narrative of adventure from\r\nthe lips of a South Down shepherd, which is communicated to me by my\r\nfriend, Mr. C. E. Clayton, of Holmbush, is nearer the normal loquacity\r\nof the type:--\"I mind one day I'd been to buy some lambs, and coming\r\nhome in the dark over the bostal, I gets to a field, and I knows there\r\nwas a g[macron e][macron a]t, and I kep' beating the hedge with my stick\r\nto find the g[macron e][macron a]t, and at last I found 'en, and I goos\r\nto get over 'en, and 'twas one of these here gurt ponds full of foul\r\nwater I'd mistook for the g[macron e][macron a]t, and so in I went, all\r\nover my head, and I tumbles out again middlin' sharp, and I slips,\r\n'cause 'twas so slubby, and in I goos again, and I do think I should ha'\r\nbeen drownded if it warn't for my stick, and I was that froughtened, and\r\nthere were some bullocks close by, and I froughtened them splashing\r\nabout and they began to run round, and that froughtened me; and\r\nthere--well, I was all wet through and grabby, and when I got home I\r\nlooked like one of these here water-cress men. But I kep' my pipe in my\r\nmouth all the time. I didn't lose 'en.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUSSEX WORDS IN AMERICA]\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. F. E. Sawyer, another student of Sussex dialect, has\r\nremarked on the similarity between Sussex provincialisms and many words\r\nwhich we are accustomed to think peculiarly American. One cause may be\r\nthe two hundred Sussex colonists taken over by William Penn, who, as we\r\nhave seen, was at one time Squire of Warminghurst. \"In recent years we\r\nhave gathered from the works of American comic writers and others many\r\nwords which at first have been termed 'vulgar Americanisms,' but which,\r\non closer examination, have proved to be good old Anglo-Saxon and other\r\nterms which had dropped out of notice amongst us, but were retained in\r\nthe _New_ World! Take, for instance, two 'Southern words,' (probably\r\nSussex) quoted by Ray (1674). _Squirm_:--Artemus Ward describes 'Brother\r\nUriah,' of 'the Shakers,' as '_squirming_ liked a speared eel,' and,\r\ncuriously enough, Ray gives 'To _squirm_, to move nimbly about after the\r\nmanner of an eel. It is spoken of eel.' Another word is 'sass' (for\r\nsauce), also quoted by Artemus Ward.... Mrs. Phoebe Earl Gibbons (an\r\nAmerican lady), in a clever and instructive article in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_ on 'English Farmers' (but, in fact, describing the\r\nagriculture, &c., of Sussex in a very interesting way), considers that\r\nthe peculiarities of the present Sussex dialect resemble those of New\r\nEngland more than of Pennsylvania. She mentions as Sussex phrases used\r\nin New England--'You hadn't ought to do it,' and 'You shouldn't ought';\r\n'Be you'? for 'Are you'? 'I see him,' for 'I saw.' 'You have a _crock_\r\non your nose,' for a smut; _nuther_ for neither; _p[dot above a]ssel_\r\nfor parcel, and a _pucker_ for a fuss. In addition she observes that\r\nSussex people speak of 'the _fall_' for autumn and 'guess' and 'reckon'\r\nlike genuine Yankees.\" So far Mr. Sawyer. Sussex people also, I might\r\nadd, \"disremember,\" as Huck Finn used to do.\r\n\r\nI should like to close the list of examples of Sussex speech by quoting\r\na few verses from the Sussex version of the \"Song of Solomon,\" which Mr.\r\nLower prepared for Prince Lucien Buonaparte some forty years ago. The\r\nexperiment was extended to other southern and western dialects, the\r\ncollection making a little book of curious charm and homeliness. Here\r\nis the fourth chapter:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SONG OF SOLOMON]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\n     1. Lookee, you be purty, my love, lookee, you be purty. You've got\r\n     dove's eyes adin yer locks; yer hair is like a flock of goäts dat\r\n     appear from Mount Gilead.\r\n\r\n     2. Yer teeth be lik a flock of ship just shared, dat come up from\r\n     de ship-wash; every one of em bears tweens, an nare a one among em\r\n     is barren.\r\n\r\n     3.

Ye've stole away my heart, my sister, my spouse. Ye've stole\r\n     away my heart wud one of yer eyes, wud one chain of yer nick.\r\n\r\n     10.

Let my beloved come into his garn, an\r\n     ait his pleasant fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nBEING A POSTSCRIPT TO THE SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt almost necessarily follows that in a book such as this, which in\r\nbrief compass attempts to take some account of every interesting or\r\ncharming spot in a large tract of country, there must be certain\r\nomissions. To the stranger the survey may seem adequate; but it is a\r\nhundred to one that a reader whose home is in Sussex will detect a\r\nflippancy or a want of true insight in the treatment of his own village.\r\nNor (rightly) does he sit silent under the conviction.\r\n\r\nI find that, with the keenest desire to be just in criticism, I have\r\nbeen unfair to several villages. I have been unfair, for example, to\r\nBurpham, which lies between Arundel and Amberley and of which nothing is\r\nsaid; and more than one reader has discovered unfairness to East Sussex.\r\nFor this the personal equation is perhaps responsible: a West Sussex\r\nman, try as he will, cannot have the same enthusiasm for the other side\r\nof his county as for his own. For me the sun has always seemed to rise\r\nover Beachy Head, the most easterly of our Downs.\r\n\r\nThe call for a second edition has however enabled me to set right a few\r\nerrors in the body of the book, and in this additional chapter to\r\namplify and fortify here and there. The result must necessarily be\r\ndisconnected; but a glance at the index will point the way to what is\r\nnew.\r\n\r\nConcerning Aldworth in Tennyson's poetry (see page 12), there is the\r\nexquisite stanza to General Hamley:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"You came, and looked, and loved the view\r\n       Long known and loved by me,\r\n     Green Sussex fading into blue\r\n       With one gray glimpse of sea.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Green Sussex fading into blue\"--it is the motto for every Down summit,\r\nSouth or North.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SHELLEY AND TRELAWNY]\r\n\r\nWith reference to Shelley and Sussex, my attention has been drawn to an\r\ninteresting account of Field Place by Mr. Hale White, the author of the\r\nMark Rutherford novels, in an old _Macmillan's Magazine_. Says Mr.\r\nWhite, \"Denne Park [at Horsham] might easily have suggested--more easily\r\nperhaps than any part of the country near Field Place--the well-known\r\nsemi-chorus in the _Prometheus_ which begins\r\n\r\n\r\n     'The path through which that lovely twain\r\n     Have passed, by cedar, pine, and yew,\r\n     And each dark tree that ever grew\r\n     Is curtained out from heaven's wide blue.'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Prometheus_, however, was written when Horsham was well-nigh\r\nforgotten\"--by its author.\r\n\r\nOwing to a curious lapse of memory, I omitted to say that Sompting, near\r\nWorthing, should be famous as the home of Edward John Trelawny, author\r\nof _The Adventures of a Younger Son_, and the friend of Shelley and\r\nByron. In his Sompting garden, in his old age, Trelawny grew figs,\r\nequal, he said, to those of his dear Italy, and lived again his\r\nvigorous, picturesque, notable life. Sussex thus owns not only the poet\r\nof \"Adonais,\" but the friend who rescued his heart from the flames that\r\nconsumed his body on the shores of the Gulf, and bearing it to Rome\r\nplaced over its resting place in the Protestant cemetery the words from\r\nthe _Tempest_ (his own happy choice):--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Nothing of him that doth fade,\r\n     But doth suffer a sea-change\r\n     Into something rich and strange.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old man, powerful and capricious to the last, died at Sompting in\r\n1881, within a year of ninety. His body was removed to Gotha for\r\ncremation, and his ashes lie beside Shelley's heart in Rome.\r\n\r\nAmong the wise men of Lewes I ought not to have overlooked William\r\nDurrant Cooper (1812-1875), a shrewd Sussex enthusiast and antiquary,\r\nwho as long ago as 1836 printed at his own cost a little glossary of the\r\ncounty's provincialisms. The book, publicly printed in 1853, was, of\r\ncourse, superseded by Mr. Parish's admirable collection, but Mr. Cooper\r\nshowed the way. One of his examples of the use of the West Sussex\r\npronoun _en_, _un_, or _um_ might be noted, especially as it involves\r\nanother quaint confusion of sex. _En_ and _un_ stand for him, her or it;\r\n_um_ for them. Thus, \"a blackbird flew up and her killed 'n\"; that is to\r\nsay, he killed it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ANGEL'S FAN]\r\n\r\nAmong the Harleian MSS. at the British Museum is the account of a\r\nsupernatural visitation to Rye in 1607. The visitants were angels, their\r\nfortunate entertainer being a married woman. She, however, by a lapse in\r\ngood breeding, undid whatever good was intended for her. \"And after that\r\nappeared unto her 2 angells in her chamber, and one of them having a\r\nwhite fan in her hand did let the same fall; and she stooping to take it\r\nupp, the angell gave her a box on the eare, rebukinge her that she a\r\nmortall creature should presume to handle matters appertayninge to\r\nheavenlie creatures.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROBERTSON OF BRIGHTON]\r\n\r\nIt was an error to omit from Chapter XVII all reference to Frederick\r\nWilliam Robertson--Robertson of Brighton--who from 1847 until 1853\r\nexerted his extraordinary influence from the pulpit of Trinity Chapel,\r\nopposite the post-office, and from his home at 9, Montpellier Terrace.\r\n\r\nOf Robertson's quickening religion I need not speak; but it is\r\ninteresting to know that much of his magnetic eloquence was the result\r\nof the meditations which he indulged in his long and feverish rambles\r\nover the Downs. His favourite walk was to the Dyke (before exploitation\r\nhad come upon it), and he loved also the hills above Rottingdean.\r\nRobertson, says Arnold's memoir, \"would walk any man 'off his legs,' as\r\nthe saying goes. He not only walked; he ran, he leaped, he bounded. He\r\nwalked as fast and as incessantly as Charles Dickens, and, like Dickens,\r\nhis mind was in a state of incessant activity all the time. There was\r\nnot a bird of the air or a flower by the wayside that was not known to\r\nhim. His knowledge of birds would have matched that of the collector of\r\nthe Natural History Museum in his favourite Dyke Road.\"\r\n\r\nRobertson often journeyed into Sussex on little preaching or lecturing\r\nmissions (he found the auditors of Hurstpierpoint \"very bucolic\"), and\r\nhis family were fond of the retirement of Lindfield. On one occasion\r\nRobertson brought them back himself, writing afterwards to a friend that\r\nin that village he \"strongly felt the beauty and power of English\r\ncountry scenery and life to calm, if not to purify, the hearts of those\r\nwhose lives are habitually subjected to such influences.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Arnold's book, I might add, has some pleasant pages about Sussex and\r\nBrighton in Robertson's day, with glimpses of Lady Byron, his ardent\r\ndevotee, and, at Old Shoreham, of Canon Mozley.\r\n\r\nAnd here I might mention that for a very charming account of a still\r\nearlier Brighton, though not the earliest, the reader should go to a\r\nlittle story called _Round About a Brighton Coach Office_, which was\r\npublished a few years ago. It has a very fragrant old-world flavour.\r\n\r\nTo Chichester, I should have recorded, belongs a Sussex saint, Saint\r\nRichard, Bishop of Chichester in the thirteenth century, and a great\r\nman. In 1245 he found the Sussex see an Augæan stable; but he was equal\r\nto the labour of cleansing it. He deprived the corrupt clergy of their\r\nbenefices with an unhesitating hand, and upon their successors and those\r\nthat remained he imposed laws of comeliness and simplicity. His reforms\r\nwere many and various: he restored hospitality to its high place among\r\nthe duties of rectors; he punished absentees; he excommunicated\r\nusurers; while (a revolutionist indeed!) priests who spoke indistinctly\r\nor at too great a pace were suspended. Also, I doubt not, he was hostile\r\nto locked churches. Furthermore, he advocated the Crusades like another\r\nPeter the Hermit.\r\n\r\nRichard's own life was exquisitely thoughtful and simple. An anecdote of\r\nhis brother, who assisted him in the practical administration of the\r\ndiocese, helps us to this side of his character. \"You give away more\r\nthan your income,\" remarked this almoner-brother one day. \"Then sell my\r\nsilver,\" said Richard, \"it will never do for me to drink out of silver\r\ncups while our Lord is suffering in His poor. Our father drank heartily\r\nout of common crockery, and so can I. Sell the plate.\"\r\n\r\nRichard penetrated on foot to the uttermost corners of his diocese to\r\nsee that all was well. He took no holiday, but would often stay for a\r\nwhile at Tarring, near Worthing, with Simon, the parish priest and his\r\ngreat friend. Tradition would have Richard the planter of the first of\r\nthe Tarring figs, and indeed, to my mind, he is more welcome to that\r\nhonour than Saint Thomas à Becket, who competes for the credit--being\r\nmore a Sussex man. In his will Richard left to Sir Simon de Terring\r\n(sometimes misprinted Ferring) his best palfrey and a commentary on the\r\nPsalms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SAINT RICHARD]\r\n\r\nThe Bishop died in 1253 and he was at once canonised. To visit his grave\r\nin the nave of Chichester Cathedral (it is now in the south transept)\r\nwas a sure means to recovery from illness, and it quickly became a place\r\nof pilgrimage. April 3 was set apart in the calendar as Richard's day,\r\nand very pleasant must have been the observance in the Chichester\r\nstreets. In 1297 we find Edward I. giving Lovel the harper 6_s._ 6_d._\r\nfor singing the Saint's praises; but Henry VIII. was to change all this.\r\nOn December 14th, 1538, it being, I imagine, a fine day, the Defender of\r\nthe Faith signed a paper ordering Sir William Goring and William Ernely,\r\nhis Commissioners, to repair to Chichester Cathedral and remove \"the\r\nbones, shrine, &c., of a certain Bishop ... which they call S.\r\nRichard,\" to the Tower of London. That the Commissioners did their work\r\nwe know from their account for the same, which came to _£_40. In the\r\nreformed prayer-book, however, Richard's name has been allowed to stand\r\namong the black letter saints.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BISHOP WILBERFORCE]\r\n\r\nUnder Chichester I ought also to have mentioned John William Burgon\r\n(1813-1888), Dean of Chichester for the last twelve years of his life\r\nand the author of that admirable collection of half-length\r\nappreciations, _The Lives of Twelve Good Men_, one of whom, Bishop\r\nWilberforce, lived within call at Woollavington, under the shaggy\r\nescarpment of the Downs some ten miles to the north-east. Dean Burgon\r\nthus happily touches off the Bishop in his South Down retreat:--\r\n\r\n... \"But it was on the charms of the pleasant landscape which surrounded\r\nhis Sussex home that he chiefly expatiated on such occasions, leaning\r\nrather heavily on some trusty arm--(I remember how he leaned on\r\n_mine_!)--while he tapped with his stick the bole of every favourite\r\ntree which came in his way (by-the-by, _every_ tree seemed a favourite),\r\nand had something to tell of its history and surpassing merits. Every\r\nfarm-house, every peep at the distant landscape, every turn in the road,\r\nsuggested some pleasant remark or playful anecdote. He had a word for\r\nevery man, woman, and child he met,--for he knew them all. The very\r\ncattle were greeted as old acquaintances. And how he did delight in\r\ndiscussing the flora of the neighbourhood, the geological formations,\r\nevery aspect of the natural history of the place!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BURPHAM AND HARDHAM]\r\n\r\nA very properly indignant friend has reminded me of the claims of\r\nBurpham in the following words. \"Two miles up the Arun valley from\r\nArundel is Burpham, a pretty village on the west edge of the Downs and\r\noverhanging the river. Between South Stoke and Arundel the old course of\r\nthe Arun runs in wide curves, and in modern times a straight new bed has\r\nbeen cut, under Arundel Park and past the Black Rabbit, making, with the\r\nold curves, the form of the letter B. Burpham lies at the head of the\r\nlower loop of the B, and while there is plenty of water in the loop to\r\nrow up with the flood tide and down with the ebb, the straight main\r\nstream diverts nearly all the holiday traffic and leaves Burpham the\r\nmost peaceful village within fifty miles of London. The seclusion is the\r\nmore complete because the roads from the South end in the village and\r\nthere is no approach by road from East or West or North. The Church\r\ncontains a Lepers' window, and passengers by the railway can see, to the\r\nright of the red roofs of the village and over the line of low chalk\r\ncliffs, a white path still called the Lepers' Path, which winds away in\r\nto the lonely hollows of the Downs.\r\n\r\n\"A curious feature of Burpham is a high rampart of earth, running\r\neastward from the cliff by the river, which according to local tradition\r\nwas constructed in the days of the Danish pirates. It is said to be\r\ndoubtful whether the rampart was erected by the Saxon villagers for\r\ntheir own protection, or by the Danes as their first stronghold on the\r\nrising ground after they had sailed up the Arun from Littlehampton. The\r\nfine name of the neighbouring Warningcamp Hill, from which there is a\r\ngreat outlook over the flat country past Arundel Castle to Chichester\r\nCathedral and the cliffs of the Isle of Wight, suggests memories of the\r\nsame period.\"\r\n\r\nOf the little retiring church of St. Botolph, Hardham, lying among low\r\nmeadows between Burpham and Pulborough, I ought also to have spoken, for\r\nit contains perhaps the earliest complete series of mural painting in\r\nEngland. The church dates from the eleventh century, and the paintings,\r\nsays Mr. Philip Mainwaring Johnson, who has studied them with the\r\ngreatest care, cannot be much less old. The subjects are the\r\nAnnunciation, the Nativity, the appearance of the Star, the Magi\r\npresenting their Gifts, and so forth, with one or two less familiar\r\nthemes added, such as Herod conferring with his Counsellors and the\r\nTorments of Hell. There are the remains also of a series of Moralities\r\ndrawn from the parable of Dives and Lazarus, and of a series\r\nillustrating the life of St. George. The little church, which perhaps\r\nhas every right to call itself the oldest picture gallery in England,\r\nshould not be missed by any visitor to Pulborough.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE TIPTEERS]\r\n\r\nAt West Wittering in the Manhood Peninsula, a little village on which\r\nthe sea has hostile designs, is still performed at Christmas a\r\ntime-honoured play the actors of which are half a dozen boys or men\r\nknown as the Tipteers. Their words are not written, but are transmitted\r\norally from one generation of players to another. Mr. J. I. C. Boger,\r\nhowever, has taken them down for the S. A. C. The subject once again, as\r\nin some of the Hardham mural paintings, is the life of St. George, here\r\ncalled King George; and the play has the same relation to drama that the\r\nHardham frescoes have to a picture. I quote a little:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Third Man--Noble Captain:_\r\n     In comes I, the Noble Captain,\r\n     Just lately come from France;\r\n     With my broad sword and jolly Turk [dirk]\r\n     I will make King George dance.\r\n\r\n_Fourth Man--King George_ [_i.e._, Saint George]:\r\n     In comes I, King George,\r\n     That man of courage bold,\r\n     With my broad sword and sphere [spear]\r\n     I have won ten tons of gold.\r\n     I fought the fiery Dragon\r\n     And brought it to great slaughter,\r\n     And by that means I wish to win\r\n     The King of Egypt's daughter.\r\n     Neither unto thee will I bow nor bend.\r\n     Stand off! stand off!\r\n     I will not take you to be my friend.\r\n\r\n_Noble Captain:_\r\n     Why, sir, why, have I done you any kind of wrong?\r\n\r\n_King George:_\r\n     Yes, you saucy man, so get you gone.\r\n\r\n_Noble Captain:_\r\n     You saucy man, you draw my name,\r\n     You ought to be stabb'd, you saucy man.\r\n\r\n_King George:_\r\n     Stab or stabs, the least is my fear;\r\n     Point me the place\r\n     And I will meet you there.\r\n\r\n_Noble Captain:_\r\n     The place I 'point is on the ground\r\n     And there I will lay your body down\r\n     Across the water at the hour of five.\r\n\r\n_King George:_\r\n     Done, sir, done! I will meet you there,\r\n     If I am alive I will cut you, I will slay you,\r\n     All for to let you know that I am King George over Great Britain O!\r\n     [FIGHT: _King George wounds the Noble Captain._]\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil the close is almost reached the West Wittering Tipteers preserve\r\nthe illusion of mediæval mummery. But the concluding song transports us\r\nto the sentiment of the modern music hall. Its chorus runs, with some\r\ncallousness:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"We never miss a mother till she's gone,\r\n     Her portrait's all we have to gaze upon,\r\n         We can fancy see her there,\r\n         Sitting in an old armchair;\r\n     We never miss a mother till she's gone.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GRANDMOTHER FOWINGTON]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE PHARISEES]\r\n\r\nMark Antony Lower's _Contributions to Literature_, 1845, contains a\r\npleasant essay on the South Downs which I overlooked when I was writing\r\nthis book, but from which I now gladly take a few passages. It gives me,\r\nfor example, a pendent to William Blake's description of a fairy's\r\nfuneral on page 64, in the shape of a description of a fairy's revenge,\r\nfrom the lips of Master Fowington, a friend of Mr. Lower, who was one\r\nthat believed in Pharisees (as Sussex calls fairies) as readily and\r\nunreservedly as we believe in wireless telegraphy. Mas' Fowington had,\r\nindeed, two very good reasons for his credulity. One was that the\r\nPharisees are mentioned in the Bible and therefore must exist; the other\r\nwas that his grandmother, \"who was a very truthful woman,\" had seen them\r\nwith her own eyes \"time and often.\" \"They was liddle folks not more\r\nthan a foot high, and used to be uncommon fond of dancing. They jound[4]\r\nhands and formed a circle, and danced upon it till the grass came three\r\ntimes as green there as it was anywhere else. That's how these here\r\nrings come upon the hills. Leastways so they say; but I don't know\r\nnothing about it, in tye,[5] for I never seen none an 'em; though to be\r\nsure it's very hard to say how them rings do come, if it is'nt the\r\nPharisees that makes 'em. Besides there's our old song that we always\r\nsing at harvest supper, where it comes in--'We'll drink and dance like\r\nPharisees.' Now I should like to know why it's put like that 'ere in the\r\nsong, if it a'nt true.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MAS' MEPPOM'S ADVENTURE]\r\n\r\nMaster Fowington's story of the fairy's revenge runs thus:--\r\n\r\n\"An ol' brother of my wife's gurt gran'mother _see_ some Pharisees once,\r\nand 'twould a been a power better if so be he hadn't never seen 'em, or\r\nleastways never offended 'em. I'll tell ye how it happened. Jeems\r\nMeppom--dat was his naüm--Jeems was a liddle farmer, and used to thresh\r\nhis own corn. His barn stood in a very _elenge_ lonesome place, a\r\ngoodish bit from de house, and de Pharisees used to come dere a nights\r\nand thresh out some wheat and wuts for him, so dat de hep o' threshed\r\ncorn was ginnerly bigger in de morning dan what he left it overnight.\r\nWell, ye see, Mas' Meppom thought dis a liddle odd, and didn't know\r\nrightly what to make ant. So bein' an out-and-out bold chep, dat didn't\r\nfear man nor devil, as de saying is, he made up his mind dat he'd goo\r\nover some night to see how 'twas managed. Well accordingly he went out\r\nrather airly in de evenin', and laid up behind de mow, for a long while,\r\ntill he got rather tired and sleepy, and thought 'twaunt no use a\r\nwatchin' no longer. It was gittin' pretty handy to midnight, and he\r\nthought how he'd goo home to bed. But jest as he was upon de move he\r\nheerd a odd sort of a soun' comin' tóe-ards the barn, and so he stopped\r\nto see what it was. He looked out of de strah, and what should he catch\r\nsight an but a couple of liddle cheps about eighteen inches high or\r\ndereaway come into de barn without uppening the doores. Dey pulled off\r\ndere jackets and begun to thresh wud two liddle frails as dey had brung\r\nwud em at de hem of a rate. Mas' Meppom would a been froughten if dey\r\nhad been bigger, but as dey was such tedious liddle fellers, he couldn't\r\nhardly help bustin right out a laffin'. Howsonever he pushed a hanful of\r\nstrah into his mouth and so managed to kip quiet a few minutes a lookin'\r\nat um--thump, thump; thump, thump, as riglar as a clock.\r\n\r\n\"At last dey got rather tired and left off to rest derselves, and one an\r\num said in a liddle squeakin' voice, as it might a bin a mouse a\r\ntalkin':--'I say Puck, I tweat; do you tweat?' At dat Jeems couldn't\r\ncontain hisself no how, but set up a loud haw-haw; and jumpin' up from\r\nde strah hollered out, 'I'll tweat ye, ye liddle rascals; what bisness a\r\nyou got in my barn?' Well upon dis, de Pharisees picked up der frails\r\nand cut away right by him, and as dey passed by him he felt sich a queer\r\npain in de head as if somebody had gi'en him a lamentable hard thump wud\r\na hammer, dat knocked him down as flat as a flounder. How long he laid\r\ndere he never rightly knowed, but it must a bin a goodish bit, for when\r\nhe come to 'twas gittin' dee-light. He could'nt hardly contrive to\r\ndoddle home, and when he did he looked so tedious bad dat his wife sent\r\nfor de doctor dirackly. But bless ye, _dat_ waunt no use; and old Jeems\r\nMeppom knowed it well enough. De doctor told him to kip up his sperits,\r\nbeein' 'twas onny a fit he had had from bein' a most smothered wud de\r\nhandful of strah and kippin his laugh down. But Jeems knowed better.\r\n'T[macron a]-ünt no use, sir,' he says, says he, to de doctor; 'de cuss\r\nof de Pharisees is uppán me, and all de stuff in your shop can't do _me_\r\nno good.' And Mas' Meppom was right, for about a year ahtawuds he died,\r\npoor man! sorry enough dat he'd ever intaf[macron e]red wud things dat\r\ndidn't consarn him. Poor ol' feller, he lays buried in de church-aird\r\nover yender--leastways so I've heerd my wife's mother say, under de\r\nbank jest where de bed of snow-draps grows.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FAIRY RINGS AND DEW PONDS]\r\n\r\nAll who know the Downs must know the fairies' or Pharisees' rings, into\r\nwhich one so often steps. Science gives them a fungoid origin, but\r\nShakespeare, as well as Master Fowington's grandmother, knew that Oberon\r\nand Titania's little people alone had the secret. Further proof is to be\r\nfound in the testimony of John Aubrey, the Wiltshire antiquary, who\r\nrecords that Mr. Hart, curate at Yatton Keynel in 1633-4, coming home\r\nover the Downs one night witnessed with his own eyes an \"innumerable\r\nquantitie of pigmies\" dancing round and round and singing, \"making all\r\nmanner of small, odd noises.\"\r\n\r\nA word ought to have been said of the quiet and unexpected dew-ponds of\r\nthe Downs, upon which one comes so often and always with a little\r\nsurprise. Perfect rounds they are, reflecting the sky they are so near\r\nlike circular mirrors set in a white frame. Gilbert White, who was\r\ninterested in all interesting things, mentions the unfailing character\r\nof a little pond near Selborne, which \"though never above three feet\r\ndeep in the middle, and not more than thirty feet in diameter, ... yet\r\naffords drink for three hundred or four hundred sheep, and for at least\r\ntwenty head of cattle beside.\" He then asks, having noticed that in May,\r\n1775, when the ponds of the valley were dry, the ponds of the hills were\r\nstill \"little affected,\" \"have not these elevated pools some unnoticed\r\nrecruits, which in the night-time counterbalance the waste of the day?\"\r\nThe answer, which White supplies, is that the hill pools are recruited\r\nby dew. \"Persons,\" he writes, \"that are much abroad, and travel early\r\nand late, such as shepherds, fishermen, &c., can tell what prodigious\r\nfogs prevail in the night on elevated downs, even in the hottest part of\r\nsummer; and how much the surfaces of things are drenched by those\r\nswimming vapours, though, to the senses, all the while, little moisture\r\nseems to fall.\"\r\n\r\nKingsley has a passage on the same subject in his essay, \"The\r\nAir-Mothers\"--\"For on the high chalk downs, you know, where farmers make\r\na sheep pond, they never, if they are wise, make it in the valley or on\r\na hillside, but on the bleakest top of the very highest down; and there,\r\nif they can once get it filled with snow and rain in winter, the blessed\r\ndews of night will keep some water in it all the summer thro', while\r\nponds below are utterly dried up.\" There is, however, another reason why\r\nthe highest points are chosen, and that is that the chalk here often has\r\na capping of red clay which holds the water.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NICK COSSUM'S HUMOUR]\r\n\r\nTo the smuggling chapter might have been added, again with Mr. Lower's\r\nassistance, a few words on the difficulties that confronted the London\r\nrevenue officers in the Sussex humour. To be confounded by too swift a\r\nhorse or too agile a \"runner\" was all in the night's work; but to be\r\nhoodwinked and bamboozled by the deliberate stealthy southern fun must\r\nhave been eternally galling. The Sussex joker grinds slowly and\r\nexceeding small; but the flour is his. \"There was Nick Cossum the\r\nblacksmith [the words are a shepherd's, talking to Mr. Lower]; he was a\r\nsad plague to them. Once he made an exciseman run several miles after\r\nhim, to take away a keg of _yeast_ he was a-carrying to Ditchling!\r\nAnother time as he was a-going up New Bostall, an exciseman, who knew\r\nhim of old, saw him a-carrying a tub of hollands. So he says, says he,\r\n'Master Cossum, I must have that tub of yours, I reckon!' 'Worse luck, I\r\nsuppose you must,' says Nick in a civil way, 'though it's rather again'\r\nthe grain to be robbed like this; but, however, I am a-going your road,\r\nand we can walk together--there's no law again' that I expect.' 'Oh,\r\ncertainly not,' says the other, taking of the tub upon his shoulders. So\r\nthey chatted along quite friendly and _chucker_[6] like till they came\r\nto a cross road, and Nick wished the exciseman good bye. After Nick had\r\ngot a little way, he turned round all of a sudden and called out: 'Oh,\r\nthere's one thing I forgot; here's a little bit o' paper that belongs to\r\nthe keg.' 'Paper,' says the exciseman, 'why, that's a _permit_,' says\r\nhe; 'why didn't you show me that when I took the hollands?' 'Oh,' says\r\nNick, as saucy as Hinds, 'why, if I had done that,' says he, 'you\r\nwouldn't a carried my tub for me all this way, would you?'\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER PARISH CLERK]\r\n\r\nThe story, at the end of Chapter XIX, of the clerk in Old Shoreham\r\nchurch, whose loyalty was too much for his ritualism, may be capped by\r\nthat of a South Down clerk in the east of the county, whose seat in\r\nchurch commanded a view of the neighbourhood. During an afternoon\r\nservice one Sunday a violent gale was raging which had already unroofed\r\nseveral barns. The time came, says Mr. Lower, for the psalm before the\r\nsermon, and the clerk rose to announce it. \"Let us sing to the praise\r\nand glo--Please, sir, Mas' Cinderby's mill is blowed down!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER MILLER]\r\n\r\nAnother word on Sussex millers. John Oliver, the Hervey of Highdown\r\nHill, had a companion in eccentricity in William Coombs of Newhaven,\r\nwho, although active as a miller to the end, was for many years a\r\nstranger to the inside of his mill owing to a rash statement one night\r\nthat if what he asseverated was not true he would never enter his mill\r\nagain. It was not true and henceforward, until his death, he directed\r\nhis business from the top step--such is the Sussex tenacity of purpose.\r\n\r\nCoombs was married at West Dean, but not fortunately. On the way to the\r\nchurch a voice from heaven called to him, \"Will-yam Coombs! Will-yam\r\nCoombs! if so be that you marry Mary ---- you'll always be a miserable\r\nman.\" Coombs, who had no false shame, often told the tale, adding, \"And\r\nI be a miserable man.\"\r\n\r\nCoombs' inseparable companion was a horse which bore him and his\r\nmerchandise to market. In order to vary the monotony of the animal's own\r\nGod-given hue, he used to paint it different colours, one day yellow and\r\nthe next pink, one day green and the next blue, and so on. But this\r\ncannot have perplexed the horse so much as his master's idea of mercy;\r\nfor when its back was over-loaded, not only with sacks of flour, but\r\nalso with Coombs, that humanitarian, experiencing a pang of sympathy,\r\nand exclaiming \"The marciful man is marciful to his beast,\" would lift\r\none of the sacks on to his own shoulders. His marcy, however, did not\r\nextend to dismounting. Our Sussex droll, Andrew Boorde, when he invented\r\nthe wisdom of Gotham, invented also the charity of Coombs. But the story\r\nis true.\r\n\r\nCoombs must not be considered typical of Sussex. Nor can the tricyclist\r\nof Chailey be called typical of Sussex--the weary man who was overtaken\r\nby a correspondent of mine on the acclivity called the King's Head Hill,\r\ntoiling up its steepness on a very old-fashioned, solid-tyred tricycle.\r\nHe had the brake hard down, and when this was pointed out to him, he\r\nreplied shrewdly, \"Eh master, but her might goo backards.\" Such\r\nwhimsical excess of caution, such thorough calculation of all the\r\nchances, is not truly typical, nor is the miller's oddity truly typical;\r\nand yet if one set forth to find humorous eccentricity, humorous\r\nsuspicion, and humorous cautiousness at their most flourishing, Sussex\r\nis the county for the search.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON TO CHICHESTER]\r\n\r\nIt ought to be known that those Londoners who would care to reach Sussex\r\nby Roman road have still Stane Street at their service. With a little\r\ndifficulty here and there, a little freedom with other people's land,\r\nthe walker is still able to travel from London to Chichester almost in a\r\nbee-line, as the Romans used. Stane Street, which is a southern\r\ncontinuation of Erming Street, pierced London's wall at Billingsgate,\r\nand that would therefore be the best starting point. The modern\r\ntraveller would set forth down the Borough High Street (as the\r\nCanterbury Pilgrims did), crossing the track of Watling Street near the\r\nElephant and Castle, and so on the present high road for several not too\r\ninteresting miles; along Newington Butts, and Kennington Park Road, up\r\nClapham Rise and Balham Hill, and so on through Tooting, Morden, North\r\nCheam, and Ewell. So far all is simple and a little prosaic, but at\r\nEpsom difficulties begin. The road from Epsom town to the racecourse\r\nclimbs to the east of the Durdans and strikes away south-west, on its\r\ntrue course again, exactly at the inn. The point to make for, as\r\nstraight as may be (passing between Ashstead on the right and Langley\r\nBottom farm on the left), is the Thirty-acres Barn, right on the site.\r\nThen direct to Leatherhead Down, through Birchgrove, over Mickleham\r\nDown, and so to the high road again at Juniper Hall. Part of the track\r\non this high ground is still called Erming Street by the country folk;\r\npart is known as Pebble Lane, where the old Roman road metal has come\r\nthrough. The old street probably followed the present road fairly\r\nclosely, with a slight deviation near the Burford Bridge Inn, as far as\r\nBoxhill Station, whence it took a bee-line to the high ground at\r\nMinnickwood by Anstiebury, four miles distant, a little to the west of\r\nHolmwood. This, if the line is to be followed, means some deliberate\r\ntrespassing and a scramble through Dorking churchyard, which is partly\r\non the site.\r\n\r\nHitherto the Roman engineer has wavered now and then, but from\r\nMinnickwood to Tolhurst Farm, fifteen miles to the south, the line is\r\nabsolute. Two miles below Ockley (where it is called Stone Street), at\r\nHalehouse Farm, the road must be left again, but after three miles of\r\nfootpath, field, and wood we hit it once more just above Dedisham, on\r\nthe road between Guildford and Horsham, and keep it all the way to\r\nPulborough, through Billingshurst, thus named, as I have said, like\r\nBillingsgate, after Belinus, Stane Street's engineer. At Pulborough we\r\nmust cut across country to the camp by Hardham, over water meadows that\r\nare too often flooded, and thence, through other fields, arable and\r\npasture, to the hostel on Bignor Hill, which once was Stane Street;\r\npassing on the right Mr. Tupper's farm and the field which contains the\r\nfamous Bignor pavements, relic of the palatial residence of the Governor\r\nof the Province of Regnum in the Romans' day; or better still, pausing\r\nthere, as Roman officers faring to Regnum certainly would in the hope of\r\na cup of Falernian.\r\n\r\nThe track winding up Bignor Hill is still easily recognisable, and from\r\nthe summit half Sussex is visible: the flat blue weald in the north,\r\nBlackdown's dark escarpment in the north-west, Arundel's shaggy wastes\r\nin the east, the sea and the plain in the south, and the rolling turf of\r\nthe downs all around. Henceforward the road is again straight, nine\r\nunfaltering miles to Chichester, which we enter by St. Pancras and East\r\nStreet. For the first four miles, however, the track is over turf and\r\namong woods, Eartham Wood on the right and North Wood on the left, and,\r\nafter a very brief spell of hard road again, over the side of Halnaker\r\nDown. But from Halnaker to Chichester it is turnpike once more, with the\r\nsavour of the Channel meeting one all the way, and Chichester's spire a\r\nfriendly beacon and earnest of the contiguous delights of the Dolphin,\r\nwhere one may sup in an assembly room spacious enough to hold a Roman\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BY ROMAN ROAD]\r\n\r\nOr one might reverse the order and walk out of Sussex into London by the\r\nRoman way, or, better still, through London, and on by Erming Street to\r\nthe wall of Antoninus. Merely to walk to London and there stop is\r\nnothing; merely to walk from London is little; but to walk through\r\nLondon ... there is glamour in that! To come bravely up from the sea at\r\nBosham, through Chichester, over the Downs to the sweet domestic\r\npeaceful green weald, over the Downs again and plunge into the grey city\r\n(perhaps at night) and out again on the other side into the green again,\r\nand so to the north, _left-right_, _left-right_, just as the clanking\r\nRomans did; that would be worth doing and worth feeling.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JOHN HORNE]\r\n\r\nThe best knower of Sussex of recent times has died since this book was\r\nprinted: one who knew her footpaths and spinneys, her hills and farms,\r\nas a scholar knows his library. John Horne of Brighton was his name: a\r\ntall, powerful man even in his old age--he was above eighty at his\r\ndeath--with a wise, shrewd head stored with old Sussex memories: hunting\r\ntriumphs; the savour of long, solitary shooting days accompanied by a\r\nmuzzle-loader and single dog--such days as Knox describes in Chapter V;\r\nhistoric cricket matches; stories of the Sussex oddities, the\r\nlong-headed country lawyers, the Quaker autocrats, the wild farmers, the\r\neccentric squires; characters of favourite horses and dogs (such was the\r\nmobility of his countenance and his instinct for drama that he could\r\nbring before you visibly any animal he described); early railway days\r\n(he had ridden in the first train that ran between Brighton and\r\nSouthwick); fierce struggles over rights-of-way; reminiscences of old\r\nBrighton before a hundredth part of its present streets were made; and\r\nall the other body of curious lore for which one must go to those whose\r\nminds dwell much in the past. Coming of Quaker stock, as he did, his\r\nmemory was good and well-ordered, and his observation quick and sound.\r\nWhat he saw he saw, and he had the unusual gift of vivid precise\r\nnarrative and a choice of words that a literary man should envy.\r\n\r\nA favourite topic of conversation between us was the best foot route\r\nbetween two given points--such as Steyning and Worthing, for example, or\r\nLewes and Shoreham. Seated in his little room, with its half-a-dozen\r\nsporting prints on the wall and a scene or two of old Brighton, he\r\nwould, with infinite detail, removing all possibility of mistake,\r\ndescribe the itinerary, weighing the merits of alternative paths with\r\nprofound solemnity, and proving the wisdom of every departure from the\r\nmore obvious track. Were Sussex obliterated by a tidal wave, and were a\r\nnew county to be constructed on the old lines, John Horne could have\r\ndone it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A SUSSEX ENTHUSIAST]\r\n\r\nOf his talk I found it impossible to tire, and I shall never cease to\r\nregret that circumstances latterly made visits to him very infrequent.\r\nTowards the end his faculties now and then were a little dimmed; but the\r\nocclusion carried compensation with it. To sit with an old man and,\r\nbeing mistaken by him for one's own grandfather, to be addressed as\r\nthough half a century had rolled away, is an experience that I would not\r\nmiss.\r\n\r\nTo the end John Horne dressed as the country gentlemen of his young days\r\nhad dressed; he might have stepped out of one of Alken's pictures, for\r\nhe possessed also the well nourished complexion, the full forehead, and\r\nthe slight fringe of whiskers which distinguished Alken's merry\r\nsportsmen. His business taking him deep into the county among the farms,\r\nhe was always in walking trim, with an umbrella crooked over one arm,\r\nhis other hand grasping the obtuse-angled handle of a ground-ash stick.\r\nThese sticks, of which he had scores, he cut himself, his eye never\r\nlosing its vigilance as he passed through a copse. Under the handle,\r\nabout an inch from the end, he screwed a steel peg, so that the stick,\r\nwhen it was not required, might hang upon his arm; while a long, stout\r\npin, with a flat brass head, was also inserted, in case his pipe needed\r\ncleaning out. Thus furnished, with umbrella and stick, pipe and a sample\r\nof his merchandise, John Horne, in his wide collar, his ample coat with\r\nvast pockets over the hips, his tight trousers, and his early-Victorian\r\nheadgear, has been, these fifty years, a familiar figure in the Weald as\r\nhe passed from farm to farm at a steady gait, his interested glances\r\nfalling this way and that, noting every change (and perhaps a little\r\nresenting it, for he was of the old Tory school), and his genial\r\nsalutation ready for all acquaintances. But he is now no more, and\r\nSussex is the poorer, and the historian of Sussex poorer still.
