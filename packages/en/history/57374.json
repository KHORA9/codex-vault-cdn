Bold\r\ncharacters, used as section headings, appear delimited by ‘=’. A single\r\ninstance of an superscripted ‘e’ is indicated with a preceding carat\r\n‘^’.\r\n\r\nThe text is annotated with numerous footnotes, which were numbered\r\nsequentially on each page. On occasion, a footnote itself is annotated\r\nby a note, using an asterisk as the reference. This distinction is\r\nfollowed here, with those ‘notes on notes’ are given alphabetic sequence\r\n(A, B, etc.). Since there are over 1500 notes in this volume, they have\r\nbeen gathered at each chapter’s end, and resequenced for each chapter.\r\n\r\nThe notes are a combination of those of the author, and of the editor of\r\nthis edition. The latter are enclosed in square brackets.\r\n\r\nFinally, the pagination of the original edition, published in the\r\n1820’s, is preserved for ease of reference by including those page\r\nnumbers in the text, also enclosed in square brackets.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of references to a map, sometimes referred to as\r\nappearing in Volume I. In this edition, the MAP appears at the end\r\nof Volume III.\r\n\r\nCrooke’s plan for the renovation of the Tod’s original text, including a\r\ndiscussion of the transliteration of word other than English, is given\r\nin detail in the Preface.\r\n\r\nMinor errors, attributable to the printer, have been corrected. Given\r\nthe history of the text, it was thought best to leave all orthography as\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\nPlease see the transcriber’s note at the end of this text for details\r\nregarding the handling of any textual issues encountered during its\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\n                         ANNALS AND ANTIQUITIES\r\n                              OF RAJASTHAN\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COLONEL JAMES TOD.\r\n  (From the bust by Vo.

That this patriarchal form is the best suited to the genius\r\nof the people may be presumed from its durability, which war, famine,\r\nand anarchy have failed to destroy. The throne has always been the\r\nwatchword and rallying-point of the Rajputs. My prayer is, that it may\r\ncontinue so, and that neither the love of conquest, nor false views of\r\npolicy, may tempt us to subvert the independence of these States, some\r\nof which have braved the storms of more than ten centuries.\r\n\r\nIt will not, I trust, be deemed presumptuous in the Annalist of these\r\ngallant and long-oppressed races thus to solicit for them a full measure\r\nof Your Majesty’s gracious patronage; in return for which, the Rajputs,\r\nmaking Your Majesty’s enemies their own, would glory in assuming the\r\n“saffron robe,” emblematic of death or victory, under the banner of that\r\nchivalry of which Your Majesty is the head.\r\n\r\nThat Your Majesty’s throne may ever be surrounded by chiefs who will act\r\nup to the principles of fealty maintained at all hazards by the Rajput,\r\nis the heartfelt aspiration of,\r\n\r\n                       SIRE,\r\n                             YOUR MAJESTY’S\r\n                                     Devoted subject and servant,\r\n                                                          JAMES TOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one can undertake with a light heart the preparation of a new edition\r\nof Colonel Tod’s great work, _The Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan_.\r\nBut the leading part which the Rājputs have taken in the Great War, the\r\nsummoning of one of their princes to a seat at the Imperial Conference,\r\nthe certainty that as the result of the present cataclysm they will be\r\nentitled to a larger share in the administration of India, have\r\ncontributed to the desire that this classical account of their history\r\nand sociology should be presented in a shape adapted to the use of the\r\nmodern scholar and student of Indian history and antiquities.\r\n\r\nIn the Introduction which follows I have endeavoured to estimate the\r\nmerits and defects of Colonel Tod’s work. Here it is necessary only to\r\nstate that though the book has been several times reprinted in India and\r\nonce in this country, the obvious difficulties of such an undertaking\r\nhave hitherto prevented any writer better qualified than myself from\r\nattempting to prepare an annotated edition. Irrespectively of the fact\r\nthat this work was published a century ago, when the study of the\r\nhistory, antiquities, sociology, and geography of India had only\r\nrecently started, the Author’s method led him to formulate theories on a\r\nwide range of subjects not directly connected with the Rājputs. In the\r\nlight of our present knowledge some of these speculations have become\r\nobsolete, and it might have been possible, without impairing the value\r\nof the work as a Chronicle of the Rājputs, to have discarded from the\r\ntext and notes much which no longer possesses value. But the work is a\r\nclassic, and it deserves to be treated as such, and it was decided that\r\nany mutilation of the original text and notes would be inconsistent with\r\nthe object of this series of reprints of classical works on Indian\r\nsubjects. The only alternative course was to correct in notes, clearly\r\ndistinguished from those of the Author, such facts and theories as are\r\nno longer accepted by scholars.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that during the last century much advance has been\r\nmade in our knowledge of Indian history, antiquities, philology, and\r\nsociology. We are now in a position to use improved translations of many\r\nauthorities which were quoted by the Author from inadequate or incorrect\r\nversions. The translation of _Ferishta’s History_ by A. Dow and Jonathan\r\nScott has been superseded by that of General J. Briggs, that of the\r\n_Āīn-i-Akbarī_ of F. Gladwin by the version by Professor H. Blochmann\r\nand Colonel H. S. Jarrett. For the _Memoirs of Jahāngīr_, the Author\r\nrelied on the imperfect version by Major David Price, which has been\r\nreplaced by a new translation of the text in its more complete form by\r\nMessrs. A. Rogers and H. Beveridge. For the _Laws of Manu_ we have the\r\ntranslation by Dr. G. Bühler. The passages in classical literature\r\nrelating to India have been collected, translated, and annotated by the\r\nlate Mr. J. W. McCrindle. Much information not available for the\r\nAuthor’s use has been provided by _The History of India as told by its\r\nown Historians_, by Sir H. M. Elliot and Professor J. Dowson, and by Mr.\r\nW. Irvine’s translation, with elaborate notes, of N. Manucci’s _Storia\r\ndo Magor_. Among original works useful for the present edition the\r\nfollowing may be mentioned: J. Grant Duff’s _History of the Mahrattas_;\r\nDr. Vincent A. Smith’s _Early History of India_, _History of Fine Art in\r\nIndia and Ceylon_, _Asoka, the Buddhist Emperor of India_, and _Akbar,\r\nthe Great Mogul_; Professor Jadunath Sarkar’s _History of Aurangzib_, of\r\nwhich only three volumes have been published; Mr. W. Irvine’s _Army of\r\nthe Indian Moghuls_; Sir W. Lee-Warner’s _Protected Princes of India_.\r\n\r\nMuch historical, geographical, and ethnological information has been\r\ncollected in the new edition of the _Imperial Gazetteer of India_, the\r\n_Bombay Gazetteer_ edited by Sir J. M. Campbell, and, more particularly,\r\nin the revised _Gazetteer of Rajputana_, including that of Mewār and the\r\nWestern States Residency and Bīkaner Agency by Lieutenant-Colonel K. D.\r\nErskine, and that of Ajmer by Mr. C. C. Watson. Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nErskine’s work, based on the best local information, has been of special\r\nvalue, and it is much to be regretted that this officer, after serving\r\nas Consul-General at Baghdad, was invalided and died in England in 1914,\r\nleaving that part of the _Gazetteer_ dealing with the Eastern States,\r\nJaipur, Kotah, and Būndi, unrevised. For botany, agriculture, and\r\nnatural productions I have used Sir G. Watt’s _Dictionary of the\r\nEconomic Products of India_, and his _Commercial Products of India_; for\r\narchitecture and antiquities, J. Fergusson’s _History of Indian and\r\nEastern Architecture_, edited by Dr. J. Burgess, and _The Cave Temples\r\nof India_ by the same writers. In ethnology I have consulted the\r\npublications of the Ethnological Survey of India, of which Mr. H. A.\r\nRose’s _Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and North-West\r\nFrontier Province_, Mr. Bhimbhai Kirparam’s account of the Hindus and\r\nKhān Bahādur Fazalullah Lutfullah’s of the Musalmāns of Gujarāt,\r\npublished in the _Bombay Gazetteer_, vol. ix. Parts i. ii., have been\r\nspecially valuable. Besides the general works to which reference has\r\nbeen made, many articles on Rajputana and the Rājputs will be found in\r\nthe _Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society_ and its Bombay branch, in the\r\n_Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal_, and in the _Indian\r\nAntiquary_, and other periodicals. The Reports of the Archaeological\r\nSurvey of India conducted by Sir A. Cunningham, Dr. J. Burgess, and Sir\r\nJ. H. Marshall, are of great importance.\r\n\r\nI cannot pretend to have exhausted the great mass of new information\r\navailable in the works to which I have referred, and in others named in\r\nthe Bibliography; and it was not my object to overload the notes which\r\nare already voluminous. To the general reader the system of annotation\r\nwhich I have attempted to carry out may appear meticulous; but no other\r\ncourse seemed possible if the work was to be made more useful to the\r\nhistorian and to the scholar. The editor of a work of this class is\r\nforced to undertake the somewhat invidious duty of calling attention to\r\noversights or errors either in fact or theory. But this does not detract\r\nfrom the real value of the work. In some cases I have been content with\r\nadding a note of interrogation to warn the reader that certain\r\nstatements must be received with caution. As regards geography, I have\r\nin many cases indicated briefly the position of the more important\r\nplaces, so far as they can be traced in the maps with which I was\r\nprovided. The Author was so intimately acquainted with the ground, that\r\nhe assumed in the general reader a degree of knowledge which he does not\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nThe text and notes, with the exception of a few obvious oversights, have\r\nbeen reprinted as they stood in the first edition, and as the latter is\r\noften quoted in books of authority, I have added its pagination for\r\nfacility of reference. It was decided, after much consideration, to\r\ncorrect the transliteration of personal and place names and other\r\nvernacular terms according to the system now adopted in official\r\ngazetteers, maps, and reports. This change might have been unnecessary\r\nif the transliteration of these words, according to the system in use at\r\nthe time when the book was written, had been uniformly correct. But this\r\nis not the case. At the same time I have preserved the original readings\r\nof those names which have become established in popular usage, such as\r\n“Mogul,” “Mahratta,” “Deccan,” in place of “Mughal,” “Marhāta,”\r\n“Dakkhin.” Following the Author’s example, I have not thought it\r\nnecessary to overload the text by the use of accents and diacritical\r\nmarks, which are useless to the scholar and only embarrass the general\r\nreader. But in the Index I have accentuated the personal and place names\r\nso far as I believed I could do so with safety. Some of these I have\r\nbeen unable to trace in later authorities, and I fear that I may have\r\nfailed to secure complete uniformity of method.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of the book, which attempts to give parallel accounts of each\r\nState, naturally causes difficulty to the reader. A like embarrassment\r\nis felt by any historian who endeavours to combine in a single narrative\r\nthe fortunes of the Mughal Empire with those of the kingdoms in Bengal,\r\nthe Deccan, or southern India; by the historian of Greece, where the\r\ncentre of activity shifts from Athens to Sparta, Thebes, or Macedonia;\r\nby the historian of Germany before the minor kingdoms were more or less\r\nfully absorbed by the Hohenzollerns. I have endeavoured to assist the\r\nreader in dealing with these independent annals by largely extending the\r\noriginal Index, and by the use of page headings and paragraph summaries.\r\n\r\nIn the dates recorded in the summaries I have generally followed\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Erskine’s guidance, so far as his work was available.\r\nIn view of the inconsistencies between some dates in the text and those\r\nrecorded in the summaries, it must be remembered that it was the\r\nAuthor’s habit in adapting the dates of the Samvat to those of the\r\nChristian era, to deduct 56, not 57 from the former, contrary to the\r\npractice of modern historians.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to many friends for assistance. Captain C. D. M’K. Blunt\r\nhas kindly given me much help in the record of Colonel Tod’s life, and\r\nhas supplied a photograph of the charming miniature of the Author as a\r\nyoung officer and of a bust which have been reproduced in the\r\nfrontispieces. Mr. R. E. Enthoven, C.I.E., has given me the photograph\r\nof the Author engaged in his studies with his Jain Guru.[p.1] The\r\nfragments of local ballads scattered through the text were unfortunately\r\ncopied from very incorrect texts. Dr. L. P. Tessitori, an Italian\r\nscholar, who, until the outbreak of the War, was engaged in collecting\r\nthe local ballads of the Rājputs, has given a correct version of these\r\nballads; and in improving the text of them I have been assisted by\r\nColonel C. E. Luard, his Pandit, and Sir G. Grierson, K.C.I.E. Since the\r\ngreater part of the following pages was in type, I have received copies\r\nof three reports by Dr. L. P. Tessitori, “A Scheme for the Bardic and\r\nHistorical Survey of Rājputāna,” and two Progress Reports for the years\r\n1915 and 1916, published in the _Journal of the Asiatic Society of\r\nBengal_ (New Series, vol. x. No. 10; xii. No. 3; xiii. No. 4). These\r\ncontain information regarding the MSS. copies of some ballads and\r\ninscriptions, which throw light on the traditions and antiquities of the\r\nRājputs. I regret that I was unable to use these papers, which, however,\r\ndo not supply much information on questions connected with _The Annals_.\r\nAmong other friends who have helped me in various ways I may name the\r\nlate Sir G. Birdwood; Mr. W. Foster, C.I.E.; Professor A. Keith, F.R.S.;\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Sir D. Prain, F.R.S.; and Dr. Vincent A.

Heatly,\r\nwas born at Islington on March 20, 1782. His father, James Tod the\r\nfirst, eldest son of Henry Tod of Bo’ness and Janet Monteath, was born\r\non October 26, 1745. In 1780 he married in New York Mary, daughter of\r\nAndrew Heatly, a member of a family originally settled at Mellerston,\r\nCo. Berwick, where they had held a landed estate for some four\r\ncenturies. Andrew Heatly emigrated to Rhode Island, where he died at the\r\nage of thirty-six in 1761. He had married Mary, daughter of Sueton\r\nGrant, of the family of Gartinbeg, really of Balvaddon, who left\r\nInverness for Newport, Rhode Island, in 1725, and Temperance Talmage or\r\nTollemache, granddaughter of one of the first and principal settlers at\r\nEasthampton, Rhode Island. He had been forced to emigrate to America\r\nduring the Protectorate, owing to his loyalty to King Charles I. James\r\nTod, the first, left America, and in partnership with his brother John,\r\nbecame an indigo-planter at Mirzapur, in the United Provinces of Agra\r\nand Oudh.\r\n\r\nJames Tod, the second, was thus through his father and his uncles\r\nPatrick and S. Heatly, both members of the Civil Service of the East\r\nIndia Company, closely connected with India, and in 1798, being then\r\nsixteen years old, he obtained through the influence of his uncle,\r\nPatrick Heatly, a cadetship in the service of the East India Company. On\r\nhis arrival at Calcutta he was attached to the 2nd European Regiment. In\r\n1800 he was transferred, with the rank of Lieutenant, to the 14th Native\r\nInfantry, from which he passed in 1807, with the same rank, to the 25th\r\nNative Infantry. In 1805 he was appointed to the command of the escort\r\nof his friend Mr. Graeme Mercer, then Government Agent at the Camp of\r\nDaulat Rao Sindhia, who had been defeated two years before at the battle\r\nof Assaye by Sir Arthur Wellesley. In more than one passage in _The\r\nAnnals_ Tod speaks of Mr. Graeme Mercer with respect and affection, and\r\nby him he was introduced to official life and Rājput and Mahratta\r\npolitics. His tastes for geographical inquiries led him to undertake\r\nsurveys in Rājputāna and Central India between 1812 and 1817, and he\r\nemployed several native surveyors to traverse the then little-known\r\nregion between Central India and the valley of the Indus.\r\n\r\nAt this period the Government of India was engaged in a project for\r\nsuppressing the Pindāris, a body of lawless freebooters, of no single\r\nrace, the débris of the adventurers who gained power during the decay of\r\nthe Mughal Empire, and who had not been incorporated in the armies of\r\nthe local powers which rose from its ruins. In 1817, to effect their\r\nsuppression, the Governor-General, the Marquess of Hastings, collected\r\nthe strongest British force which up to that time had been assembled in\r\nIndia. Two armies, acting in co-operation from north and south,\r\nconverged on the banditti, and met with rapid success. Sindhia, whose\r\npower depended on the demoralized condition of Rājputāna, was overawed;\r\nHolkar was defeated; the Rāja of Nāgpur was captured; the Mahratta\r\nPeshwa became a fugitive; the Pindāris were dispersed. One of their\r\nleaders, Amīr Khān, who is frequently mentioned in Tod’s narrative,\r\ndisbanded his forces, and received as his share of the spoils the\r\nPrincipality of Tonk, still ruled by his descendants.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this campaign Tod performed valuable services. At the\r\nbeginning of the operations he supplied the British Staff with a rough\r\nmap of the seat of war, and in other ways his local knowledge was\r\nutilized by the Generals in charge of the operations. In 1813 he had\r\nbeen promoted to the rank of Captain in command of the escort of the\r\nResident, Mr. Richard Strachey, who nominated him to the post of his\r\nSecond Assistant. In 1818 he was appointed Political Agent of Western\r\nRājputāna, a post which he held till his retirement in June 1822. The\r\nwork which he carried out in Rājputāna during this period is fully\r\ndescribed in _The Annals_ and in his “Personal Narrative.” Owing to\r\nMahratta oppression and the ravages of the Pindāris, the condition of\r\nthe country, political, social, and economical, was deplorable. To\r\nremedy this prevailing anarchy the States were gradually brought under\r\nBritish control, and their relations with the paramount power were\r\nembodied in a series of treaties. In this work of reform,\r\nreconstruction, and conciliation, Tod played an active part, and the\r\nconfidence and respect with which he was regarded by the Princes,\r\nChiefs, and peasantry enabled him to interfere with good effect in\r\ntribal quarrels, to rearrange the fiefs of the minor Chiefs, and to act\r\nas arbitrator between the Rāna of Mewār and his subjects.\r\n\r\nTod was convinced that the miserable state of the country was chiefly\r\ndue to the hesitation of the Indian Government in interfering for the\r\nre-establishment of order; and on this ground he does not hesitate to\r\ncondemn the cautious policy of Lord Cornwallis during his second term of\r\noffice as Governor-General. Few people at the present day would be\r\ndisposed to defend the policy of non-intervention. “This policy has been\r\ncondemned by historians and commentators, as well as by statesmen,\r\nsoldiers, and diplomatists; by Mill and his editor, H. H. Wilson, and by\r\nThornton; by Lord Lake and Sir John Malcolm. The mischief was done and\r\nthe loss of influence was not regained for a decade. It was not till the\r\nconclusion of an expensive and protracted campaign, that the Indian\r\nGovernment was replaced in the position where it had been left by\r\nWellesley. The blame for this weak and unfortunate policy must be\r\ndivided between Cornwallis and Barlow, between the Court of Directors\r\nand the Board of Control.” But it was carried out in pursuance of orders\r\nfrom the Home Government. “The Court of Directors for some time past had\r\nbeen alarmed at Lord Wellesley’s vigorous foreign policy. Castlereagh at\r\nthe Board of Control had taken fright, and even Pitt was carried away\r\nand committed himself to a hasty opinion that the Governor-General had\r\nacted imprudently and illegally.”[i.1]\r\n\r\nTod tells us little of his relations with the Supreme Government during\r\nhis four years’ service as Political Agent. He was notoriously a\r\npartisan of the Rājput princes, particularly those of Mewār and Mārwār;\r\nhe is never tired of abusing the policy of the Emperor Aurangzeb, and,\r\nfortunately for the success of his work, Muhammadans form only a slight\r\nminority in the population of Rājputāna. This attitude naturally exposed\r\nhim to criticism. Writing in 1824, Bishop Heber,[i.2] while he\r\nrecognizes that he was held in affection and respect by “all the upper\r\nand middling classes of society,” goes on to say: “His misfortune was\r\nthat, in consequence of his favouring the native princes so much, the\r\nGovernment of Calcutta were led to suspect him of corruption, and\r\nconsequently to narrow his powers and associate other officers with him\r\nin his trust till he was disgusted and resigned his place. They are now,\r\nI believe, well satisfied that their suspicions were groundless. Captain\r\nTodd (_sic_) is strenuously vindicated from the charge by all the\r\nofficers with whom I have conversed, and some of whom had abundant means\r\nof knowing what the natives themselves thought of him.” The Bishop’s\r\nwidow, in a later issue of the _Diary_ of her husband, adds that \"she is\r\nanxious to remove any unfavourable impressions which may exist on the\r\nsubject by stating, that she has now the authority of a gentleman, who\r\nat the time was a member of the Supreme Council, to say, that no such\r\nimputation was ever fixed on Colonel Todd´s (_sic_) character.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the real reason for the premature termination of\r\nhis official career at the age of forty, ill-health was put forward as\r\nthe ostensible cause of his retirement. He had served for about\r\ntwenty-four years in the Indian plains without any leave; he had long\r\nsuffered from malaria; and, though he hardly suspected it at the time,\r\nan attempt had been made by one of his servants to poison him with\r\nDatura; he had met with a serious accident when, by chance or design,\r\nhis elephant-driver dashed his howdah against the gate of Begūn fort in\r\neastern Mewār. In spite of all this, he retained sufficient health to\r\nmake, on the eve of his departure from India, the extensive tour\r\nrecorded in his _Travels in Western India_. Neither on his retirement,\r\nnor at any subsequent period, were his services, official and literary,\r\nrewarded by any distinction.\r\n\r\nDuring his seventeen years’ service in Central India and Rājputāna he\r\nshowed indefatigable industry in the collection of the materials which\r\nwere partially used in his great work. His taste for the study of\r\nhistory and antiquities, ethnology, popular religion, and superstitions\r\nwas stimulated by the pioneer work of Sir W. Jones and other writers in\r\nthe _Asiatic Researches_. He was not a trained philologist, and he\r\ngained much of his information from his Guru, the Jain Yati Gyānchandra,\r\nand the Brāhman Pandits whom he employed to make inquiries on his\r\nbehalf. They, too, were not trained scholars in the modern sense of the\r\nterm, and many of his mistakes are due to his rashness in following\r\ntheir guidance.\r\n\r\nHis life was prolonged for thirteen years after he left India. In 1824\r\nhe attained the rank of Major, and in 1826 that of Lieutenant-Colonel.\r\nMuch of his time in England was spent in arranging his materials and\r\ncompiling the works upon which his reputation depends: _The Annals_,\r\npublished between 1829 and 1832; and his _Travels in Western India_,\r\npublished after his death, in 1839. He was in close relations with the\r\nRoyal Asiatic Society, of which he acted for a time as Librarian. In\r\nthis fine collection of books and manuscripts he gained much of that\r\ndiscursive learning which appears in _The Annals_. He presented to the\r\nSociety numerous manuscripts, inscriptions, and coins. The fine series\r\nof drawings made to illustrate his works by Captain P. T. Waugh and a\r\nnative artist named Ghāsi, have recently been rearranged and catalogued\r\nin the Library of the Society. They well deserve inspection by any one\r\ninterested in Indian art. He also made frequent tours on the Continent,\r\nand on one occasion visited the great soldier, Count Benoit de Boigne,\r\nwho died in 1830, leaving a fortune of twenty millions of francs.\r\n\r\nOn November 16, 1826, Tod married Julia, daughter of Dr. Henry\r\nClutterbuck, an eminent London surgeon, by whom he had two sons and a\r\ndaughter. In 1835 he settled in a house in Regent’s Park, and on\r\nNovember 17 of the same year he died suddenly while transacting business\r\nat the office of his bankers, Messrs. Robarts of Lombard Street. The\r\nnames of his descendants will appear from the pedigree appended to this\r\nIntroduction.\r\n\r\n_The Annals of Rajasthan_, the two volumes of which were, by permission,\r\ndedicated to Kings George IV. and William IV. respectively, was received\r\nwith considerable favour. A contemporary critic deals with it in the\r\nfollowing terms:[i.3] “Colonel Tod deserves the praise of a most\r\ndelightful and industrious collector of materials for history, and his\r\nown narrative style in many places displays great freedom, vigour, and\r\nperspicuity. Though not always correct, and occasionally stiff and\r\nformal, it is not seldom highly animated and picturesque. The faults of\r\nhis work are inseparable from its nature; it would have been almost\r\nimpossible to mould up into one continuous history the distinct and\r\nseparate annals of the various Rajput races. The patience of the reader\r\nis thus unavoidably put to a severe trial, in having to reascend to the\r\norigin, and again to trace downwards the parallel annals of some new\r\ntribe—sometimes interwoven with, sometimes entirely distinct from, those\r\nwhich have gone before. But, on the whole, as no one but Colonel Tod\r\ncould have gathered the materials for such a work, there are not many\r\nwho could have used them so well. No candid reader can arise from its\r\nperusal without a very high sense of the character of the Author—no\r\nscholar, more certainly, without respect for his attainments, and\r\ngratitude for the service which he has rendered to a branch of\r\nliterature, if far from popular, by no means to be estimated, as to its\r\nreal importance, by the extent to which it may command the favour of an\r\nage of duodecimos.”\r\n\r\nIn estimating the value of the local authorities on which the history is\r\nbased, Tod reposed undue confidence in the epics and ballads composed by\r\nthe poet Chānd and other tribal bards. It is believed that more than one\r\nof these poems have disappeared since his time, and these materials have\r\nbeen only in part edited and translated. The value to be placed on\r\nbardic literature is a question not free from difficulty. “On the faith\r\nof ancient songs, the uncertain but the only memorials of barbarism,”\r\nsays Gibbon, “they [Cassiodorus and Jornandes] deduced the first origin\r\nof the Goths.”[i.4] The poet may occasionally record facts of value, but\r\nin his zeal for the honour of the tribe which he represents, he is\r\ntempted to exaggerate victories, to minimize defeats. This is a danger\r\nto which Indian poets are particularly exposed. Their trade is one of\r\nfulsome adulation, and in a state of society like that of the Rājputs,\r\nwhere tribal and personal rivalries flourish, the temptation to give a\r\nfalse colouring to history is great. In fact, bardic literature is often\r\nuseful, not as evidence of occurrences in antiquity, but as an\r\nindication of the habits and beliefs current in the age of the writer.\r\nIt exhibits the facts, not as they really occurred, but as the writer\r\nand his contemporaries supposed that they occurred. The mind of the\r\npoet, with all its prejudices, projects itself into the distant past.\r\nGood examples of the methods of the bards will appear in the attempt to\r\nconnect the Rāthors with the dynasty of Kanauj, or to represent the\r\nChauhāns as the founders of an empire in the Deccan.\r\n\r\nRecent investigation has thrown much new light on the origin of the\r\nRājputs. A wide gulf lies between the Vedic Kshatriya and the Rājput of\r\nmedieval times which it is now impossible to bridge. Some clans, with\r\nthe help of an accommodating bard, may be able to trace their lineage to\r\nthe Kshatriyas of Buddhist times, who were recognized as one of the\r\nleading elements in Hindu society, and, in their own estimation, stood\r\neven higher than the Brāhmans.[i.5] But it is now certain that the\r\norigin of many clans dates from the Saka or Kushān invasion, which began\r\nabout the middle of the second century B.C., or more certainly, from\r\nthat of the White Huns who destroyed the Gupta empire about A.D. 480.\r\nThe Gurjara tribe connected with the latter people adopted Hinduism, and\r\ntheir leaders formed the main stock from which the higher Rājput\r\nfamilies sprang. When these new claimants to princely honours accepted\r\nthe faith and institutions of Brahmanism, the attempt would naturally be\r\nmade to affiliate themselves to the mythical heroes whose exploits are\r\nrecorded in the Mahābhārata and Rāmāyana. Hence arose the body of legend\r\nrecorded in _The Annals_ by which a fabulous origin from the Sun or Moon\r\nis ascribed to two great Rājput branches, a genealogy claimed by other\r\nprincely families, like the Incas of Peru or the Mikado of Japan. Or, as\r\nin the case of the Rāthors of Mārwār, an equally fabulous story was\r\ninvented to link them with the royal house of Kanauj, one of the genuine\r\nold Hindu ruling families. The same feeling lies at the root of the\r\n_Aeneid_ of Virgil, the court poet of the new empire. The clan of the\r\nemperor Augustus, the Iulii, a patrician family of Alban origin, was\r\nrepresented as the heirs of Iulus, the supposed son of Aeneas and\r\nfounder of Alba Longa, thus linking the new Augustan house with the\r\nheroes of the _Iliad_.\r\n\r\nOne of the merits of Tod’s work is that, though his knowledge of\r\nethnology was imperfect, and he was unable to reject the local\r\nchronicles of the Rājputs, he advocated, in anticipation of the\r\nconclusions of later scholars, the so-called “Scythic” origin of the\r\nrace. To make up for the lack of direct evidence of Scythian manners and\r\nsociology to support this position, he was forced to rely on certain\r\nsuperficial resemblances of custom and belief, not between Rājputs,\r\nScythians and Huns, but between Rājputs, Getae or Thracians, or the\r\nGermans of Tacitus. In the same way a supposed identity of name led him\r\nto identify the Jāts of northern India with the Getae or with the Goths,\r\nand finally to bring them with the Jutes into Kent.\r\n\r\nA similar process of groping in semi-darkness induced him to make\r\nconstant references to serpent worship, which, as Sir E. Tylor remarked,\r\n\"years ago fell into the hands of speculative writers who mixed it up\r\nwith occult philosophies, druidical mysteries, and that portentous\r\nnonsense called the ‘Arkite symbolism,’ till now sober students hear the\r\nvery name of ophiolatry with a shudder.\"[i.6] He repeatedly speaks of a\r\npeople whom he calls the “Takshaks,” apparently one of the Scythian\r\ntribes. There is, however, no reason to believe that serpent worship\r\nformed an important element in the beliefs of the Scythians, or to\r\nsuppose that the cult, as we observe it in India, is of other than\r\nindigenous origin.\r\n\r\nThe more recent views of the origin of the Rājputs may be briefly\r\nillustrated in connexion with some of the leading septs. Dr. Vincent A.\r\nSmith holds that the term Kshatriya was not an ethnical but an\r\noccupational designation. Rājaputra, ‘son of a Rāja,’ seems to have been\r\na name applied to the cadets of ruling houses who, according to the\r\nancient custom of tribal society, were in the habit of seeking their\r\nfortunes abroad, winning by some act of valour the hand of the princess\r\nwhose land they visited, and with it the succession to the kingdom\r\nvested in her under the system of Mother Right. Sir James Frazer has\r\ndescribed various forms of this mode of succession in the case of the\r\nKings of Rome, Ashanti, Uganda, in certain Greek States, and other\r\nplaces.[i.7] Dr. Smith goes on to say: “The term Kshatriya was, I\r\nbelieve, always one of very vague meaning, simply denoting the Hindu\r\nruling classes which did not claim Brahmanical descent. Occasionally a\r\nrājā might be a Brahman by caste, but the Brahman’s place at court was\r\nthat of a minister rather than that of king.”[i.8] This office in\r\nRajputana, as we learn from numerous instances in _The Annals_, was\r\noften taken by members of the Bania or mercantile class, because the\r\nBrāhmans of the Desert, by their laxity of practice, had acquired an\r\nequivocal reputation, and were generally illiterate. The Rājput has\r\nalways, until recent times, favoured the Bhāt or bard more than the\r\nBrāhman.\r\n\r\nThe group denoted by the name Kshatriya or Rājput thus depended on\r\nstatus rather than on descent, and it was therefore possible for\r\nforeigners to be introduced into the tribes without any violation of the\r\nprejudices of caste, which was then only partially developed. In later\r\ntimes, under Brāhman guidance, the rules of endogamy, exogamy, and\r\n_confarreatio_ have been definitely formulated. But as the power of the\r\npriesthood increased, it was necessary to disguise this admission of\r\nforeigners under a convenient fiction. Hence arose the legend, told in\r\ntwo different forms in _The Annals_, which describes how, by a solemn\r\nact of purification or initiation, under the superintendence of one of\r\nthe ancient Vedic Rishis or inspired saints, the “fire-born” septs were\r\ncreated to help the Brāhmans in repressing Buddhism, Jainism, or other\r\nheresies, and in establishing the ancient traditional Hindu social\r\npolicy, the temporary downfall of which, under the stress of foreign\r\ninvasions, is carefully concealed in the Hindu sacred literature. This\r\nprivilege was, we are told, confined to four septs, known as Agnikula,\r\nor ‘fire-born’—the Pramār, Parihār, Chālukya or Solanki, and the\r\nChauhān. But there is good reason to believe that the Pramār was the\r\nonly sept which laid claim to this distinction before the time of the\r\npoet Chānd, who flourished in the twelfth century of our era.[i.9] The\r\nlocal tradition in Rājputāna was so vague that in one version of the\r\nstory Vasishtha, in the other Visvāmitra, is said to have been the\r\nofficiating priest.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Sesodias of Mewār, Mr. D. R. Bhandarkar has given\r\nreasons to believe that Gehlot or Guhilot means simply ‘son of Guhila,’\r\nan abbreviation of Guhadatta, the name of its founder.[i.10] He is said\r\nto have belonged to the Gurjara stock, kinsmen or allies of the Huns who\r\nentered India about the sixth century of our era, and founded a kingdom\r\nin Rājputāna with its capital at Bhilmāl or Srīmāl, about fifty miles\r\nfrom Mount Ābu, the scene of the regeneration of the Rājputs. This\r\nbranch, which took the name of Maitrika, is said to be closely connected\r\nwith the Mer tribe, which gave its name to Merwāra, and is fully\r\ndescribed in _The Annals_. The actual conqueror of Chitor, Bāpa or\r\nBappa, is said in inscriptions to have belonged to the branch known as\r\nNāgar, or ‘City’ Brāhmans which has its present headquarters at the town\r\nof Vadnagar in the Baroda State. This conversion of a Brāhman into a\r\nRājput is at first sight startling, but the fact implies that the\r\ninstitution of caste, as we observe it, was then only imperfectly\r\nestablished, and there was no difficulty in believing that a Brāhman\r\ncould be ancestor of a princely house which now claims descent from the\r\nSun. As will appear later on, Bāpa seems to be a historical personage.\r\nThese facts help us to understand the strange story in _The Annals_,\r\nwhich tells how Gohāditya received inauguration as chief by having his\r\nforehead smeared with blood drawn from the finger of a Bhīl, a form of\r\nthe blood covenant which appears among many savage tribes.[i.11] In\r\nthose days no definite line was drawn between the Bhīls, now a wild\r\nforest tribe, and the Rājputs. The Bhīls were the free lords of the\r\njungle, original owners of the soil, and though they practised rites and\r\nfollowed customs repulsive to orthodox Hindus, they did not share in the\r\nimpurity which attached to foul outcastes like the Dom or the Chandāla.\r\nAs the Bhīls were believed to be autochthonous, and thus understood the\r\nmethods of controlling or conciliating the local spirits, by this form\r\nof inauguration they passed on their knowledge to the Rājputs whom they\r\naccepted as their lords. The relations of the Mīnas, another jungle\r\ntribe of the same class, with the Kachhwāhas of Jaipur were of the same\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nAccording to the bardic legend given in _The Annals_, the Rāthors, the\r\nsecond great Rājput clan, owed their origin to a migration of a body of\r\nits members to the western Desert when the territory of Kanauj was\r\nconquered by Shihābu-d-dīn in A.D. 1193. But it is now certain that the\r\nruling dynasty of Kanauj belonged, not to the Rāthor, but to the\r\nGaharwār clan, and that the first Rāthor settlement in Rājputāna must\r\nhave occurred anterior to the conquest of Kanauj by the Musalmāns. An\r\ninscription, dated A.D. 997, found in the ruins of the ancient town of\r\nHathūndi or Hastikūndi in the Bali Hakūmat of the Jodhpur State, names\r\nfour Rāthor Rājas who reigned there in the tenth century.[i.12] The\r\nlocal legend is an attempt to connect the line of Rāthor princes with\r\nthe Kanauj dynasty. It has been suggested that the Deccan dynasty of the\r\nRāshtrakūtas which, in name at least, is identical with Rāthor, reigning\r\nat Nāsik or Malkhed from A.D. 753 to 973, was connected with the Reddis\r\nor Raddis, a caste of cultivators which seem to have migrated from\r\nMadras into the Deccan at an early period. But any racial connexion\r\nbetween the Deccan Reddis and the Rāthors of Rājputāna is very\r\ndoubtful.[i.13]\r\n\r\nThe Chandel clan, ranked in _The Annals_ among the Thirty-six Royal\r\nRaces, is believed to be closely connected with the Bhars and Gonds,\r\nforest tribes of Bundelkhand and the Central Provinces. Mr. R. V.\r\nRussell prefers to connect them with the Bhars alone, on the ground that\r\nthe Gonds, according to the best traditions, entered the Central\r\nProvinces from the south, and made no effective settlement in\r\nBundelkhand, the headquarters of the Chandels.[i.14] But there was a\r\nGond settlement in the Hamīrpur District of Bundelkhand, and the close\r\nconnexion between the Gonds and the Chandels began in what is now the\r\nChhatarpur State.\r\n\r\nThe results of recent investigations into Rājput ethnology are thus of\r\ngreat importance, and enable us to correct the bardic legends on which\r\nthe genealogies recorded in _The Annals_ were founded. Much remains to\r\nbe done before the question can be finally settled. The local Rājput\r\ntraditions and the ballads of the bards must be collected and edited;\r\nthe ancient sites in Rājputāna must be excavated; physical measurements,\r\nnow somewhat discredited as a test of racial affinities, must be made in\r\nlarger numbers and by more scientific methods. But the general thesis\r\nthat some of the nobler Rājput septs are descended from Gurjaras or\r\nother foreigners, while others are closely connected with the\r\nautochthonous races, may be regarded as definitely proved.\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable parts of _The Annals_ is the chapter describing\r\nthe popular religion of Mewār, the festival and rites in honour of\r\nGauri, the Mother goddess. There are also many incidental notices of\r\ncults and superstitions scattered through the work. A race of warriors\r\nlike the Rājputs naturally favours the worship of Siva who, as the\r\nsuccessor of Rudra, the Vedic storm-god, was originally a\r\nterror-inspiring deity, a side of his character only imperfectly veiled\r\nby his euphemistic title of Siva, ‘the blessed or auspicious One.’ In\r\nhis phallic manifestation his chief shrine is at Eklingji, ‘the single\r\nor notable phallus,’ about fourteen miles north of Udaipur city. The\r\nRānas hold the office of priest-kings, Dīwāns or prime-ministers of the\r\ngod. Their association with this deity has been explained by an\r\ninscription recently found in the temple of Nātha, ‘the Lord,’ now used\r\nas a storeroom of the Eklingji temple.[i.15] The inscription, dated A.D.\r\n971, is in form of a dedication to Lakulīsa, a form of Siva represented\r\nas bearing a club, and refers to the Saiva sect known as\r\nLakulīsa-Pāsapatas. It records the name of a king named Srī-Bappaka,\r\n‘the moon among the princes of the Guhila dynasty,’ who reigned at a\r\nplace called Nāgahvada, identified with Nāgda, an ancient town several\r\ntimes mentioned in _The Annals_, the ruins of which exist at the foot of\r\nthe hill on which the temple of Eklingji stands. Srī-Bappaka is\r\ncertainly Bāpa or Bappa, the traditional founder of the Mewār dynasty,\r\nwhich had at that time its capital at Nāgda. From this inscription it is\r\nclear that the Eklingji temple was in existence before A.D. 971, and, as\r\nMr. Bhandarkar remarks, “it shows that the old tradition about Nāgendra\r\nand Bappa Rāwal’s infancy given by Tod had some historical foundation,\r\nand it is intelligible how the Rānas of Udaipur could have come to have\r\nsuch an intimate connexion with the temple as that of high priests, in\r\nwhich capacity they still officiate.” This office vested in them is a\r\ngood example of one of those dynasties of priest-kings of which Sir\r\nJames Frazer has given an elaborate account.[i.16]\r\n\r\nThe milder side of the Rājput character is represented in the cult of\r\nKrishna at Nāthdwāra. The Mahant or Abbot of the temple, situated at the\r\nold village of Siārh, twenty-two miles from the city of Udaipur, enjoys\r\nsemi-royal state. In anticipation of the raid by Aurangzeb on Mathura,\r\nA.D. 1669-70, the ancient image of Kesavadeva, a form of Krishna, ‘He of\r\nthe flowing locks,’ was removed out of reach of danger by Rāna Rāj Singh\r\nof Mewār. When the cart bearing the image arrived at Siārh, the god, by\r\nstopping the cart, is said to have expressed his intention of remaining\r\nthere. This was the origin of the famous temple, still visited by crowds\r\nof pilgrims, and one of the leading seats of the Vallabhāchārya sect,\r\n‘the Epicureans of the East,’ whose practices, as disclosed in the\r\nfamous Mahārāja libel case, tried at Bombay in 1861, gave rise to\r\ngrievous scandal.[i.17] The ill-feeling against this sect, aroused by\r\nthese revelations, was so intense that the Mahārāja of Jaipur ordered\r\nthat the two famous images of Krishna worshipped in his State, which\r\noriginally came from Gokul, near Mathura, should be removed from his\r\nterritories into those of the Bharatpur State.\r\n\r\nTod bears witness to the humanizing effect on the Rājputs of the worship\r\nof this god, whom he calls “the Apollo of Braj,” the holy land of\r\nKrishna near Mathura. He also asserts that the Emperor Akbar favoured\r\nthe worship of Krishna, a feeling shared by his successors Jahāngīr and\r\nShāh Jahān. Akbar, in his search for a new faith to supersede Islām, of\r\nwhich he was _parcus cultor et infrequens_, dallied with Hindu Pandits,\r\nParsi priests, and Christian missionaries, and he was doubtless well\r\ninformed about the sensuous ritual of the temple of Nāthdwāra.[i.18]\r\n\r\nThe character of the Rājputs is discussed in many passages in _The\r\nAnnals_. The Author expresses marked sympathy with the people among whom\r\nhis official life was spent, and he expresses gratitude for the courtesy\r\nand confidence which they bestowed upon him. This applies specially to\r\nthe Sesodias of Mewār and the Rāthors of Mārwār, with whom he lived in\r\nthe closest intimacy. He shows, on the other hand, a decided prejudice\r\nagainst the Kachhwāhas of Jaipur, of whose diplomacy he disapproved.\r\nThis feeling, we may suspect, was due in part to their hesitation in\r\naccepting the British alliance, a policy in which he was deeply\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nThe virtues of the Rājput lie on the surface—their loyalty, devotion,\r\nand gallantry; their chivalry towards women; their regard for their\r\nnational customs. Their weaknesses—though Tod does not enumerate them in\r\ndetail—are obvious from a study of their history—their instability of\r\ncharacter, their liability to sudden outbreaks of passion, their\r\ntendency to yield to panic on the battlefield, their inability, as a\r\nresult of their tribal system, to form a permanent combination against a\r\npublic enemy, their occasional faithlessness to their chiefs and allies,\r\ntheir excessive use of opium. These defects they share with most\r\norientals, but, on the whole, they compare favourably with other races\r\nin the Indian Empire. There is much in their character and institutions\r\nwhich reminds us of the Gauls as pictured by Mommsen in a striking\r\npassage.[i.19] Rājput women are described as virtuous, affectionate, and\r\ndevoted, taking part in the control of the family, sharing with their\r\nhusbands the dangers of war and sport, contemptuous of the coward, and\r\nexercising a salutary influence in public and domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, Tod omits to give us a detailed account of their\r\nmarriage regulations and ceremonies. According to Mr. E. H. Kealy,[i.20]\r\nwhile male children under one year old exceed the females, “the excess\r\nis not sufficiently great to justify the conclusion that female babies\r\nare murdered, nor is the theory that female infants lost their lives by\r\nneglect supported by the statistics. Unhappily the returns show that a\r\nhigh proportion of married women is combined with a very low percentage\r\nof females as compared with males between the ages of ten and fourteen,\r\nthe early stage of married life, and this defect is largely due to\r\npremature cohabitation, lack of medical attendance, and of sanitary\r\nprecautions.” No one can read without horror the many narratives of the\r\nJohar, the final sacrifice by which women in the hour of defeat gave\r\ntheir lives to save their honour, and of the numerous cases of Sati.\r\nBoth these customs are now only a matter of history, but so late as 1879\r\nGeneral Hervey was able to count at the Bikaner palace the handmarks of\r\nat least thirty-seven widows who ascended the pyre with their\r\nlords.[i.21]\r\n\r\nMuch space in _The Annals_ is occupied by a review of the so-called\r\n‘Feudal’ system in Rājputāna. Tod was naturally attracted in the course\r\nof his discursive reading by Henry Hallam’s _View of the State of Europe\r\nduring the Middle Ages_, which first appeared in 1818, four years before\r\nTod resigned his Indian appointment. Hallam himself was careful to point\r\nout that “it is of great importance to be on our guard against seeming\r\nanalogies which vanish away when they are closely observed.”[i.22] This\r\nwarning Tod unguardedly overlooked. Hallam recognized that Feudalism was\r\nan institution the ultimate origin of which is still, to some extent,\r\nobscure. It possibly began with the desire for protection, the\r\n_rakhwāli_ of the Rājputs, but it seems to have been ultimately based on\r\nthe private law of Rome, while the influence of the Church, interested\r\nin securing its endowments, was a factor in its evolution. In its\r\ncompleted form it represented the final stage of a process which began\r\nunder the Frankish conquerors of Gaul. At any rate, it was of European\r\norigin, and though it absorbed much that was common to the types of\r\ntribal organization found in other parts of the world, it was moulded by\r\nthe political, social, and economical environment amidst which it was\r\ndeveloped. Hence, while it is possible to trace, as Tod has done,\r\ncertain analogies between the tribal institutions of the Rājputs and the\r\nsocial organization of medieval Europe—analogies of feudal incidents\r\nconnected with Reliefs, Fines upon alienation, Escheats, Aids, Wardship,\r\nand Marriage—these analogies, when more closely examined, are found to\r\nbe in the main superficial. If we desire to undertake a comparative\r\nstudy of the Rājput tribal system, it is unnecessary to travel to\r\nmedieval Europe, while we have close at hand the social organization of\r\nmore or less kindred tribes on the Indian borderland, Pathāns, Afghāns,\r\nor Baloch; or, in a more primitive stage, those of the Kandhs, Gonds,\r\nMūndas, or Orāons. It is of little service to compare two systems of\r\nwhich only the nucleus is common to both, and to place side by side\r\ninstitutions which present only a factitious similitude, because the\r\nsocial development of each has progressed on different lines.\r\n\r\nThe Author’s excursions into philology are the diversions of a clever\r\nman, not of a trained scholar, but interested in the subject as an\r\namateur. In his time the new learning on oriental subjects had only\r\nrecently begun to attract the attention of scholars, of which Sir W.\r\nJones was the prophet. Tod was a diligent student of _The Asiatic\r\nResearches_, the publication of which began at Calcutta in 1788. While\r\nmuch material of value is to be found in these volumes, many papers of\r\nCaptain Francis Wilford and others are full of rash speculations which\r\nhave not survived later criticism. Tod is not to blame because he\r\nfollowed the guidance of scholars who contributed articles to the\r\nleading Indian review of his time; because he was ignorant of the laws\r\nof Grimm or Verner; because, like his contemporaries, he believed that\r\nthe mythology of Egypt or Palestine influenced the beliefs of the Indian\r\npeople. It was his fate that many of his guesses were quoted with\r\napproval by writers like T. Maurice in his _Indian Antiquities_, and by\r\nN. Pococke in his _India in Greece_. It is also well to remember that\r\nmany of the derivations of the names of Indian deities, confidently\r\nproposed by Kuhn and Max Müller a few years ago, are no longer accepted.\r\nTod, at any rate, published his views on Feudalism and Philology without\r\nany pretence of dogmatism.\r\n\r\nOne special question deserves examination—the constant references to the\r\ncult of Bāl-Siva, a form of the Sun god. A learned Indian scholar,\r\nPandit Gaurishankar Ojha, who is now engaged on an annotated edition of\r\n_The Annals_ in Hindi, states that no temple or image dedicated to this\r\ngod is known in Rājputāna. It is, of course, not unlikely that Siva, as\r\na deity of fertility, should be associated with Sun worship, but there\r\nis no evidence of the cult on which Tod lays special stress. It is\r\nalmost useless to speculate on the source of his error. It may be based\r\non a reference in the _Āin-i-Akbari_[i.23] to a certain Bālnāth, Jogi,\r\nwho occupied a cell in a place in the Sindh Sāgar Duāb of the Panjāb. At\r\nthe same time, like many of the writers of his day, he may have had the\r\nSemitic Baal in his mind.\r\n\r\nIt was largely due to imperfect information received from his assistants\r\nthat he shared with other writers of the time the confusion between\r\nBuddhism and Jainism, and supposed that the former religion was\r\nintroduced into India from Central Asia. His elaborate attempt to\r\nextract history and a trustworthy scheme of chronology from the Purānas\r\nmust be pronounced to be a failure. Recently a learned scholar, Mr. F.\r\nE. Pargiter, has shown how far an examination of these authorities can\r\nbe conducted with any approach to probability.[i.24]\r\n\r\nThe questions which have been discussed do not, to any important extent,\r\ndetract from the real value of the work. Even in those points which are\r\nmost open to criticism, _The Annals_ possesses importance because it\r\nrepresents a phase in the study of Indian religions, ethnology, and\r\nsociology. No one can examine it without increasing pleasure and\r\nadmiration for a writer who, immersed in arduous official work, was able\r\nto indulge his tastes for research. His was the first real attempt to\r\ninvestigate the beliefs of the peasantry as contrasted with the official\r\nBrahmanism, a study which in recent years has revolutionized the current\r\nconceptions of Hinduism. Even if his versions of the inscriptions which\r\nhe collected fail to satisfy the requirements of more recent scholars,\r\nhe deserves credit for rescuing from neglect and almost certain\r\ndestruction epigraphical material for the use of his successors. The\r\nsame may be said of the drawings of buildings, some of which have fallen\r\ninto decay, or have been mutilated by their careless guardians. When he\r\ndeals with facts which came under his personal observation, his accounts\r\nof beliefs, folk-lore, social life, customs, and manners possess\r\npermanent value.\r\n\r\nHe observed the Rājputs when they were in a stage of transition.\r\nIsolated by the inaccessibility of their country, they were the last\r\nguardians of Hindu beliefs, institutions, and manners against the rising\r\ntide of the Muhammadan invasions; without their protection much that is\r\nimportant for the study of the Hindus must have disappeared. To avoid\r\nanarchy and the ultimate destruction of these States, it was necessary\r\nfor them to accept a closer union with the British as the paramount\r\npower. By this they lost something, but they gained much. The new\r\nconnexion involved new duties and responsibilities in adapting their\r\nprimitive system of government to modern requirements. Tod thus stood at\r\nthe parting of the ways. With the introduction of the railway and the\r\npost-office, the disappearance of the caravan as a means of transport,\r\nthe increase of trade, the growth of new wants and possibilities of\r\ndevelopment in association with the Empire, the period of Rājput\r\nisolation came to a close. To some it may be a matter of regret that the\r\npersonal rule of the Chief over a people strongly influenced by what\r\nthey term _swāmīdharma_, the reciprocal loyalty of subject to prince and\r\nof prince to people, should be replaced by a government of a more\r\npopular type. But this change was, in the nature of things, inevitable.\r\nAs an example of this, a statement made by the Mahārāja of Bīkaner, when\r\nhe was summoned to attend the Imperial Conference in 1917, may be\r\nquoted. “In my own territories we inaugurated some years ago the\r\nbeginnings of a representative assembly. It now consists of elected, as\r\nwell as nominated, non-official members, and their legislative powers\r\nfollow the lines of those laid down for the Legislatures of British\r\nIndia in the 1909 reforms. In respect to the Budget they have the same\r\npowers as those conferred on the Supreme and Provincial Legislatures in\r\nBritish India by the Lansdowne reforms in force from 1893 to 1909. When\r\nannouncing my intention of creating this representative body, I\r\nintimated that as the people showed their fitness they would be\r\nentrusted with more powers. Accordingly, at the end of the first\r\ntriennial term, when the elections will take place, we are revising the\r\nrules of business in the direction of greater liberality and of removing\r\nunnecessary restrictions.” It remains to be seen how far this policy\r\nwill prove to be successful.\r\n\r\nIt was a happy accident that before the period of transition had begun\r\nin earnest, such a competent and sympathetic observer should have been\r\nable to examine and record one of the most interesting surviving phases\r\nof the ancient Hindu polity.\r\n\r\nA soldier and a sportsman, Tod learned to understand the romantic,\r\nadventurous side of the Rājput character, and he recorded with full\r\nappreciation the fine stories of manly valour, of the self-sacrifice of\r\nwomen, the tragedies of the sieges of Chitor, the heroism of Rānas Sanga\r\nand Partāb Singh, or of Durgādās. Many of these tales recall the age of\r\nmedieval chivalry, and Tod is at his best in recording them. No one can\r\nread without admiration his account of the attack of the Saktāwats and\r\nChondāwats on Untāla; of Sūja and the tiger; the tragedy of Krishna\r\nKunwāri; of the queen of Ganor; of Sanjogta of Kanauj; of Gūga Chauhān\r\nand Alu Hāra. In many of these tales the Rājput displays the loyalty and\r\nvalour, the punctilious regard for his personal honour which in the case\r\nof the Spanish grandee have passed into a proverb.\r\n\r\nWhile the Rājput is courteous in his intercourse with those who are\r\nprepared to take him as he is, when he meets an English officer he\r\nresents any hint of patronage, he is jealous of any intrusion on the\r\nsecluded folk behind the curtain, and he is often rather an acquaintance\r\nthan a friend, inclined to shelter himself behind a dignified reserve,\r\nunwilling to open his mind to any one who does not accept his\r\ntraditional attitude towards men of a different race and of a different\r\nfaith. When he makes a ceremonial visit to a European officer, his\r\nconversation is often confined to conventional compliments, or chat\r\nabout the weather and the state of the crops.\r\n\r\nTo remove these difficulties which obstruct friendly and confidential\r\nintercourse, the young officer in India may be advised to study the\r\nmethods illustrated in this work. But he will do well to avoid Tod’s\r\nopenly expressed partisanship. He owed the affection and respect\r\nbestowed upon him by prince and peasant, and even by the jealously\r\nguarded ladies of the zenanah, to his kindliness and sympathy, his\r\nreadiness to converse freely with men of all classes, his patience in\r\nlistening to grievances, even those which he had no power to redress,\r\nhis impartiality as an arbitrator between the Rāna of Mewār and his\r\npeople or between individuals or sects unfriendly to each other. He\r\nstudied the national traditions and usages; he knew enough of religious\r\nbeliefs and of social customs to save him from giving offence by word or\r\ndeed; he could converse with the people in their own patois, and could\r\ngive point to a remark by an apt quotation of a proverb or a scrap of an\r\nold ballad.\r\n\r\nWhen, if ever, a new history of the Rājputs comes to be written, it must\r\nbe largely based on Tod’s collections, supplemented by wider historical,\r\nantiquarian, and epigraphical research. The history of the last century\r\ncannot be compiled until the recent administration reports, now treated\r\nas confidential, and the muniment rooms of Calcutta and London are open\r\nto the student. But it is unlikely that, for the present at least, any\r\nwriter will enjoy, as Tod did, access to the records and correspondence\r\nstored in the palaces of the Chiefs.\r\n\r\nFor the Rājput himself and for natives of India interested in the\r\nhistory of their country, the work will long retain its value. It\r\npreserves a record of tribal rights and privileges, of claims based on\r\nancient tradition, of feuds and their settlement, of genealogies and\r\nfamily history which, but for Tod’s careful record, might have been\r\nforgotten or misinterpreted even by the Rājputs themselves. In the\r\noriginal English text which many Rājputs are now able to study they will\r\nfind a picture of tribal society, now rapidly disappearing, drawn by a\r\ncompetent and friendly hand. Its interest will not be diminished by the\r\nfact that while the writer displays a hearty admiration for the Rājput\r\ncharacter, he is not blind to its defects. At any rate, the Rājput will\r\nenjoy the satisfaction that his race has been selected to furnish the\r\nmaterials for the most comprehensive monograph ever compiled by a\r\nBritish officer describing one of the leading peoples of India.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote i.1:\r\n\r\n  W.

When Sir William Jones first began to\r\nexplore the vast mines of Sanskrit literature, great hopes were\r\nentertained that the history of the world would acquire considerable\r\naccessions from this source. The sanguine expectations that were then\r\nformed have not been realized; and, as it usually happens, excitement\r\nhas been succeeded by apathy and indifference. It is now generally\r\nregarded as an axiom, that India possesses no national history; to which\r\nwe may oppose the remark of a French Orientalist, who ingeniously asks,\r\nwhence Abu-l Fazl obtained the materials for his outlines of ancient\r\nHindu history?[i.25] Mr. Wilson has, indeed, done much to obviate this\r\nprejudice, by his translation of the _Raja Tarangini_, or History of\r\nKashmir,[i.26] which clearly demonstrates that regular historical\r\ncomposition was an art not unknown in Hindustan, and affords\r\nsatisfactory ground for concluding that these productions were once less\r\nrare than at present, and that further exertion may bring more relics to\r\nlight. Although the labours of Colebrooke, Wilkins, Wilson, and others\r\nof our own countrymen, emulated by many learned men in France [viii] and\r\nGermany,[i.27] have revealed to Europe some of the hidden lore of India;\r\nstill it is not pretended that we have done much more than pass the\r\nthreshold of Indian science; and we are consequently not competent to\r\nspeak decisively of its extent or its character. Immense libraries, in\r\nvarious parts of India, are still intact, which have survived the\r\ndevastations of the Islamite. The collections of Jaisalmer and Patan,\r\nfor example, escaped the scrutiny of even the lynx-eyed Alau-d-din who\r\nconquered both these kingdoms, and who would have shown as little mercy\r\nto those literary treasures, as Omar displayed towards the Alexandrine\r\nlibrary. Many other minor collections, consisting of thousands of\r\nvolumes each, exist in Central and Western India, some of which are the\r\nprivate property of princes, and others belong to the Jain\r\ncommunities.[i.28]\r\n\r\nIf we consider the political changes and convulsions which have happened\r\nin Hindustan since Mahmud’s invasion, and the intolerant bigotry of many\r\nof his successors, we shall be able to account for the paucity of its\r\nnational works on history, without being driven to the improbable\r\nconclusion, that the Hindus were ignorant of an art which has been\r\ncultivated in other countries from almost the earliest ages. Is it to be\r\nimagined that a nation so highly civilized as the Hindus, amongst whom\r\nthe exact sciences flourished in perfection, by whom the fine arts [ix],\r\narchitecture, sculpture, poetry, music, were not only cultivated, but\r\ntaught and defined by the nicest and most elaborate rules, were totally\r\nunacquainted with the simple art of recording the events of their\r\nhistory, the characters of their princes, and the acts of their reigns?\r\nWhere such traces of _mind_ exist, we can hardly believe that there was\r\na want of competent recorders of events, which synchronical authorities\r\ntell us were worthy of commemoration. The cities of Hastinapur and\r\nIndraprastha, of Anhilwara and Somanatha, the triumphal columns of Delhi\r\nand Chitor, the shrines of Abu and Girnar, the cave-temples of Elephanta\r\nand Ellora, are so many attestations of the same fact; nor can we\r\nimagine that the age in which these works were erected was without an\r\nhistorian. Yet from the Mahabharata or Great War, to Alexander’s\r\ninvasion, and from that grand event to the era of Mahmud of Ghazni,\r\nscarcely a paragraph of pure native Hindu history (except as before\r\nstated) has hitherto been revealed to the curiosity of Western scholars.\r\nIn the heroic history of Prithiraj, the last of the Hindu sovereigns of\r\nDelhi, written by his bard Chand, we find notices which authorize the\r\ninference that works similar to his own were then extant, relating to\r\nthe period between Mahmud and Shihabu-d-din (A.D. 1000-1193); but these\r\nhave disappeared.\r\n\r\nAfter eight centuries of galling subjection to conquerors totally\r\nignorant of the classical language of the Hindus; after almost every\r\ncapital city had been repeatedly stormed and sacked by barbarous,\r\nbigoted, and exasperated foes; it is too much to expect that the\r\nliterature of the country should not have sustained, in common with\r\nother important interests, irretrievable losses. My own animadversions\r\nupon the defective condition of the annals of Rajwara have more than\r\nonce been checked by a very just remark: \"when our princes were in\r\nexile, driven from hold to hold, and compelled to dwell in the clefts of\r\nthe mountains, often doubtful whether they would not be forced to [x]\r\nabandon the very meal preparing for them, was that a time to think of\r\nhistorical records?\"\r\n\r\nThose who expect from a people like the Hindus a species of composition\r\nof precisely the same character as the historical works of Greece and\r\nRome, commit the very egregious error of overlooking the peculiarities\r\nwhich distinguish the natives of India from all other races, and which\r\nstrongly discriminate their intellectual productions of every kind from\r\nthose of the West. Their philosophy, their poetry, their architecture,\r\nare marked with traits of originality; and the same may be expected to\r\npervade their history, which, like the arts enumerated, took a character\r\nfrom its intimate association with the religion of the people. It must\r\nbe recollected, moreover, that until a more correct taste was imparted\r\nto the literature of England and of France, by the study of classical\r\nmodels, the chronicles of both these countries, and indeed of all the\r\npolished nations of Europe, were, at a much more recent date, as crude,\r\nas wild, and as barren as those of the early Rajputs.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of regular and legitimate historical records, there are,\r\nhowever, other native works (they may, indeed, be said to abound),\r\nwhich, in the hands of a skilful and patient investigator, would afford\r\nno despicable materials for the history of India. The first of these are\r\nthe Puranas and genealogical legends of the princes, which, obscured as\r\nthey are by mythological details, allegory, and improbable\r\ncircumstances, contain many facts that serve as beacons to direct the\r\nresearch of the historian. What Hume remarks of the annals and annalists\r\nof the Saxon Heptarchy, may be applied with equal truth to those of the\r\nRajput Seven States:[i.29] \"they abound in names, but are extremely\r\nbarren of events; or they are related so much without circumstances and\r\ncauses, that the most profound and eloquent writer must despair [xi] of\r\nrendering them either instructive or entertaining to the reader. The\r\nmonks\" (for which we may read “Brahmans”), “who lived remote from public\r\naffairs, considered the civil transactions as subservient to the\r\necclesiastical, and were strongly affected with credulity, with the love\r\nof wonder, and with a propensity to imposture.”\r\n\r\nThe heroic poems of India constitute another resource for history. Bards\r\nmay be regarded as the primitive historians of mankind. Before fiction\r\nbegan to engross the attention of poets, or rather, before the province\r\nof history was dignified by a class of writers who made it a distinct\r\ndepartment of literature, the functions of the bard were doubtless\r\nemployed in recording real events and in commemorating real personages.\r\nIn India Calliope has been worshipped by the bards from the days of\r\nVyasa, the contemporary of Job, to the time of Benidasa, the present\r\nchronicler of Mewar. The poets are the chief, though not the sole,\r\nhistorians of Western India; neither is there any deficiency of them,\r\nthough they speak in a peculiar tongue, which requires to be translated\r\ninto the sober language of probability. To compensate for their\r\nmagniloquence and obscurity, their pen is free: the despotism of the\r\nRajput princes does not extend to the poet’s lay, which flows unconfined\r\nexcept by the shackles of the _chand bhujanga_, or ‘serpentine stanza’;\r\nno slight restraint, it must be confessed, upon the freedom of the\r\nhistoric muse. On the other hand, there is a sort of compact or\r\nunderstanding between the bard and the prince, a barter of “solid\r\npudding against empty praise,” whereby the fidelity of the poetic\r\nchronicle is somewhat impaired. This sale of “fame,” as the bards term\r\nit, by the court-laureates and historiographers of Rajasthan, will\r\ncontinue until there shall arise in the community a class sufficiently\r\nenlightened and independent, to look for no other recompense for\r\nliterary labour than public distinction.\r\n\r\nStill, however, these chroniclers dare utter truths, sometimes most\r\n[xii] unpalatable to their masters. When offended, or actuated by a\r\nvirtuous indignation against immorality, they are fearless of\r\nconsequences; and woe to the individual who provokes them! Many a\r\nresolution has sunk under the lash of their satire, which has condemned\r\nto eternal ridicule names that might otherwise have escaped notoriety.\r\nThe _vish_, or poison of the bard, is more dreaded by the Rajput than\r\nthe steel of the foe.\r\n\r\nThe absence of all mystery or reserve with regard to public affairs in\r\nthe Rajput principalities, in which every individual takes an interest,\r\nfrom the noble to the porter at the city-gates, is of great advantage to\r\nthe chronicler of events. When matters of moment in the disorganized\r\nstate of the country rendered it imperative to observe secrecy, the Rana\r\nof Mewar, being applied to on the necessity of concealing them, rejoined\r\nas follows: “this is Chaumukha-raj;[i.30] Eklinga the sovereign, I his\r\nvicegerent; in him I trust, and I have no secrets from my children.” To\r\nthis publicity may be partly ascribed the inefficiency of every general\r\nalliance against common foes; but it gives a kind of patriarchal\r\ncharacter to the government, and inspires, if not loyalty and patriotism\r\nin their most exalted sense, feelings at least much akin to them.\r\n\r\nA material drawback upon the value of these bardic histories is, that\r\nthey are confined almost exclusively to the martial exploits of their\r\nheroes, and to the _rang-ran-bhum_, or ‘field of slaughter.’ Writing for\r\nthe amusement of a warlike race, the authors disregard civil matters and\r\nthe arts and pursuits of peaceful life; love and war are their favourite\r\nthemes. Chand, the last of the great bards of India, tells us, indeed,\r\nin his preface, “that he will give rules for governing empires; the laws\r\nof grammar and composition; lessons in diplomacy, home and foreign,\r\netc.”: and he fulfils his promise, by interspersing precepts on these\r\npoints in various episodes throughout his work [xiii].\r\n\r\nAgain: the bard, although he is admitted to the knowledge of all the\r\nsecret springs which direct each measure of the government, enters too\r\ndeeply into the intrigues, as well as the levities, of the court, to be\r\nqualified to pronounce a sober judgment upon its acts.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, although open to all these objections, the works of the\r\nnative bards afford many valuable data, in facts, incidents, religious\r\nopinions, and traits of manners; many of which, being carelessly\r\nintroduced, are thence to be regarded as the least suspicious kind of\r\nhistorical evidence. In the heroic history of Prithiraj, by Chand, there\r\noccur many geographical as well as historical details, in the\r\ndescription of his sovereign’s wars, of which the bard was an\r\neye-witness, having been his friend, his herald, his ambassador, and\r\nfinally discharging the melancholy office of accessory to his death,\r\nthat he might save him from dishonour. The poetical histories of Chand\r\nwere collected by the great Amra Singh of Mewar, a patron of literature,\r\nas well as a warrior and a legislator.[i.31]\r\n\r\nAnother species of historical records is found in the accounts given by\r\nthe Brahmans of the endowments of the temples, their dilapidation and\r\nrepairs, which furnish occasions for the introduction of historical and\r\nchronological details. In the legends, respecting places of pilgrimage\r\nand religious resort, profane events are blended with superstitious\r\nrites and ordinances, local ceremonies and customs. The controversies of\r\nthe Jains furnish, also, much historical information, especially with\r\nreference to Gujarat and Nahrwala, during the Chaulukya dynasty. From a\r\nclose and attentive examination of the Jain records, which embody all\r\nthat those ancient sectarians knew of science, many chasms in Hindu\r\nhistory might be filled up. The party-spirit of the rival sects of India\r\nwas, doubtless, adverse to the purity of history; and the very ground\r\nupon which the Brahmans built their ascendency was the ignorance of the\r\npeople. There appears to have been in India [xiv], as well as in Egypt\r\nin early times, a coalition between the hierarchy and the state, with\r\nthe view of keeping the mass of the nation in darkness and subjugation.\r\n\r\nThese different records, works of a mixed historical and geographical\r\ncharacter which I know to exist; _raesas_ or poetical legends of\r\nprinces, which are common; local Puranas, religious comments, and\r\ntraditionary couplets;[i.32] with authorities of a less dubious\r\ncharacter, namely, inscriptions ‘cut on the rock,’ coins, copper-plate\r\ngrants, containing charters of immunities, and expressing many singular\r\nfeatures of civil government, constitute, as I have already observed, no\r\ndespicable materials for the historian, who would, moreover, be assisted\r\nby the synchronisms which are capable of being established with ancient\r\nPagan and later Muhammadan writers.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest period of my official connexion with this interesting\r\ncountry, I applied myself to collect and explore its early historical\r\nrecords, with a view of throwing some light upon a people scarcely yet\r\nknown in Europe and whose political connexion with England appeared to\r\nme to be capable of undergoing a material change, with benefit to both\r\nparties. It would be wearisome to the reader to be minutely informed of\r\nthe process I adopted, to collect the scattered relics of Rajput history\r\ninto the form and substance in which he now sees them. I began with the\r\nsacred genealogy from the Puranas; examined the Mahabharata, and the\r\npoems of Chand (a complete chronicle of his times); the voluminous\r\nhistorical poems of Jaisalmer, Marwar, and Mewar;[i.33] the histories of\r\nthe Khichis, and those of the Hara princes [xv] of Kotah and Bundi,\r\netc., by their respective bards. A portion of the materials compiled by\r\nJai Singh of Amber or Jaipur (one of the greatest patrons of science\r\namongst the modern Hindu princes), to illustrate the history of his\r\nrace, fell into my hands. I have reason to believe that there existed\r\nmore copious materials, which his profligate descendant, the late\r\nprince, in his division of the empire with a prostitute, may have\r\ndisposed of on the partition of the library of the State, which was the\r\nfinest collection in Rajasthan. Like some of the renowned princes of\r\nTimur’s dynasty, Jai Singh kept a diary, termed _Kalpadruma_, in which\r\nhe noted every event: a work written by such a man and at such an\r\ninteresting juncture, would be a valuable acquisition to history. From\r\nthe Datia prince I obtained a transcript of the journal of his ancestor,\r\nwho served with such _éclat_ amongst the great feudatories of\r\nAurangzeb’s army, and from which Scott made many extracts in his history\r\nof the Deccan.\r\n\r\nFor a period of ten years I was employed, with the aid of a learned\r\nJain, in ransacking every work which could contribute any facts or\r\nincidents to the history of the Rajputs, or diffuse any light upon their\r\nmanners and character. Extracts and versions of all such passages were\r\nmade by my Jain assistant into the more familiar dialects (which are\r\nformed from the Sanskrit) of these tribes, in whose language my long\r\nresidence amongst them enabled me to converse with facility. At much\r\nexpense, and during many wearisome hours, to support which required no\r\nordinary degree of enthusiasm, I endeavoured to possess myself not\r\nmerely of their history, but of their religious notions, their familiar\r\nopinions, and their characteristic manners, by associating with their\r\nchiefs and bardic chroniclers, and by listening to their traditionary\r\ntales and allegorical poems. I might ultimately, as the circle of my\r\n[xvi] inquiries enlarged, have materially augmented my knowledge of\r\nthese subjects; but ill-health compelled me to relinquish this pleasing\r\nthough toilsome pursuit, and forced me to revisit my native land just as\r\nI had obtained permission to look across the threshold of the Hindu\r\nMinerva; whence, however, I brought some relics, the examination of\r\nwhich I now consign to other hands. The large collection of ancient\r\nSanskrit and Bhakha MSS., which I conveyed to England, have been\r\npresented to the Royal Asiatic Society, in whose library they are\r\ndeposited. The contents of many, still unexamined, may throw additional\r\nlight on the history of ancient India. I claim only the merit of having\r\nbrought them to the knowledge of European scholars; but I may hope that\r\nthis will furnish a stimulus to others to make similar exertions.\r\n\r\nThe little exact knowledge that Europe has hitherto acquired of the\r\nRajput States, has probably originated a false idea of the comparative\r\nimportance of this portion of Hindustan. The splendour of the Rajput\r\ncourts, however, at an early period of the history of that country,\r\nmaking every allowance for the exaggeration of the bards, must have been\r\ngreat. Northern India was rich from the earliest times; that portion of\r\nit, situated on either side the Indus, formed the richest satrapy of\r\nDarius. It has abounded in the more striking events which constitute the\r\nmaterials for history; there is not a petty State in Rajasthan that has\r\nnot had its Thermopylae, and scarcely a city that has not produced its\r\nLeonidas. But the mantle of ages has shrouded from view what the magic\r\npen of the historian might have consecrated to endless admiration:\r\nSomnath might have rivalled Delphos; the spoils of Hind might have vied\r\nwith the wealth of the Libyan king; and compared with the array of the\r\nPandus, the army of Xerxes would have dwindled into insignificance. But\r\nthe Hindus either never had, or have unfortunately lost, their Herodotus\r\nand Xenophon.\r\n\r\nIf “the moral effect of history depend on the sympathy it excites”\r\n[xvii], the annals of these States possess commanding interest. The\r\nstruggles of a brave people for independence during a series of ages,\r\nsacrificing whatever was dear to them for the maintenance of the\r\nreligion of their forefathers, and sturdily defending to death, and in\r\nspite of every temptation, their rights and national liberty, form a\r\npicture which it is difficult to contemplate without emotion. Could I\r\nimpart to the reader but a small portion of the enthusiastic delight\r\nwith which I have listened to the tales of times that are past, amid\r\nscenes where their events occurred, I should not despair of triumphing\r\nover the apathy which dooms to neglect almost every effort to enlighten\r\nmy native country on the subject of India; nor should I apprehend any\r\nill effect from the sound of names, which, musical and expressive as\r\nthey are to a Hindu, are dissonant and unmeaning to a European ear: for\r\nit should be remembered that almost every Eastern name is significant of\r\nsome quality, personal or mental. Seated amidst the ruins of ancient\r\ncities, I have listened to the traditions respecting their fall; or have\r\nheard the exploits of their illustrious defenders related by their\r\ndescendants near the altars erected to their memory. I have, whilst in\r\nthe train of the southern Goths (the Mahrattas), as they carried\r\ndesolation over the land, encamped on or traversed many a field of\r\nbattle, of civil strife or foreign aggression, to read in the rude\r\nmemorials on the tumuli of the slain their names and history. Such\r\nanecdotes and records afford data of history as well as of manners. Even\r\nthe couplet recording the erection of a ‘column of victory,’ or of a\r\ntemple or its repairs, contributes something to our stock of knowledge\r\nof the past.\r\n\r\nAs far as regards the antiquity of the dynasties now ruling in Central\r\nand Western India, there are but two the origin of which is not\r\nperfectly within the limits of historical probability; the rest having\r\nowed their present establishments to the progress of the Muslim arms,\r\ntheir annals are confirmed by those of their conquerors. All the\r\nexisting [xviii] families, indeed, have attained their present\r\nsettlements subsequently to the Muhammadan invasions, except Mewar,\r\nJaisalmer, and some smaller principalities in the desert; whilst others\r\nof the first magnitude, such as the Pramara and Solanki, who ruled at\r\nDhar and Anhilwara, have for centuries ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nI have been so hardy as to affirm and endeavour to prove the common\r\norigin of the martial tribes of Rajasthan and those of ancient Europe. I\r\nhave expatiated at some length upon the evidence in favour of the\r\nexistence of a feudal system in India, similar to that which prevailed\r\nin the early ages on the European continent, and of which relics still\r\nremain in the laws of our own nation. Hypotheses of this kind are, I am\r\naware, viewed with suspicion, and sometimes assailed with ridicule. With\r\nregard to the notions which I have developed on these questions, and the\r\nfrequent allusions to them in the pages of this volume, I entertain no\r\nobstinate prepossessions or prejudices in their favour. The world is too\r\nenlightened at the present day to be in danger of being misled by any\r\nhypothetical writer, let him be ever so skilful; but the probability is,\r\nthat we have been induced, by the multitude of false theories which time\r\nhas exposed, to fall into the opposite error, and that we have become\r\ntoo sceptical with regard to the common origin of the people of the east\r\nand west. However, I submit my proofs to the candid judgment of the\r\nworld; the analogies, if not conclusive on the questions, are still\r\nsufficiently curious and remarkable to repay the trouble of perusal and\r\nto provoke further investigation; and they may, it is hoped, vindicate\r\nthe author for endeavouring to elucidate the subject, “by steering\r\nthrough the dark channels of antiquity by the feeble lights of forgotten\r\nchronicles and imperfect records.”\r\n\r\nI am conscious that there is much in this work which demands the\r\nindulgence of the public; and I trust it will not be necessary for me to\r\nassign a more powerful argument in plea than that which I have already\r\n[xix] adverted to, namely, the state of my health, which has rendered it\r\na matter of considerable difficulty, indeed I may say of risk, to bring\r\nmy bulky materials even into their present imperfect form. I should\r\nobserve, that it never was my intention to treat the subject in the\r\nsevere style of history, which would have excluded many details useful\r\nto the politician as well as to the curious student. I offer this work\r\nas a copious collection of materials for the future historian; and am\r\nfar less concerned at the idea of giving too much, than at the\r\napprehension of suppressing what might possibly be useful.\r\n\r\nI cannot close these remarks without expressing my obligations to my\r\nfriend and kinsman, Major Waugh, to the genius of whose pencil the world\r\nis indebted for the preservation and transmission of the splendid\r\nmonuments of art which adorn this work.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote i.25:\r\n\r\n  M. Abel Rémusat, in his _Mélanges Asiatiques_, makes many apposite and\r\n  forcible remarks on this subject, which, without intention, convey a\r\n  just reproof to the lukewarmness of our countrymen. The institution of\r\n  the Royal Asiatic Society, especially that branch of it devoted to\r\n  Oriental translations, may yet redeem this reproach.\r\n\r\nFootnote i.26:\r\n\r\n  _Asiatic Researches_, vol. xv. [The _Rājatarangini_ of Kalhana has\r\n  been translated by M. A. Stein, 2 vols., London, 1910.]\r\n\r\nFootnote i.27:\r\n\r\n  When the genius and erudition of such men as Schlegel are added to the\r\n  zeal which characterizes that celebrated writer, what revelations may\r\n  we not yet expect from the cultivation of oriental literature?\r\n\r\nFootnote i.28:\r\n\r\n  Some copies of these Jain MSS. from Jaisalmer, which were written from\r\n  five to eight centuries back, I presented to the Royal Asiatic\r\n  Society. Of the vast numbers of these MS. books in the libraries of\r\n  Patan and Jaisalmer, many are of the most remote antiquity, and in a\r\n  character no longer understood by their possessors, or only by the\r\n  supreme pontiff and his initiated librarians. There is one volume held\r\n  so sacred for its magical contents, that it is suspended by a chain in\r\n  the temple of Chintaman, at the last-named capital in the desert, and\r\n  is only taken down to have its covering renewed, or at the\r\n  inauguration of a pontiff. Tradition assigns its authorship to\r\n  Somaditya Suru Acharya, a pontiff of past days, before the Islamite\r\n  had crossed the waters of the Indus, and whose diocese extended far\r\n  beyond that stream. His magic mantle is also here preserved, and used\r\n  on every new installation. The character is, doubtless, the\r\n  nail-headed Pali; and could we introduce the ingenious, indefatigable,\r\n  and modest Mons. E. Burnouf, with his able coadjutor Dr. Lassen, into\r\n  the temple, we might learn something of this Sibylline volume, without\r\n  their incurring the risk of loss of sight, which befel the last\r\n  individual, a female Yati of the Jains, who sacrilegiously endeavoured\r\n  to acquire its contents. [For the temple library at Jaisalmer see\r\n  _IA_, iv. 81 ff; for those at Udaipur, _ibid._ xiii. 31. J.

Besides these, there were fragments of the Jaipur family,\r\n  from their archives; and the _Man Charitra_, or history of Raja Man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      AUTHOR’S INTRODUCTION TO THE\r\n                     SECOND VOLUME OF THE ORIGINAL\r\n                                EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn placing before the public the concluding volume of the _Annals of\r\nRajputana_ I have fulfilled what I considered to be a sacred obligation\r\nto the races amongst whom I have passed the better portion of my life;\r\nand although no man can more highly appreciate public approbation, I am\r\nfar less eager to court that approbation than to awaken a sympathy for\r\nthe objects of my work, the interesting people of Rajputana.\r\n\r\nI need add nothing to what was urged in the Introduction to the First\r\nVolume on the subject of Indian History; and trust that, however slight\r\nthe analogy between the chronicles of the Hindus and those of Europe, as\r\nhistorical works, they will serve to banish the reproach, which India\r\nhas so long laboured under, of possessing no records of past events: my\r\nonly fear now is, that they may be thought redundant.\r\n\r\nI think I may confidently affirm, that whoever, without being alarmed at\r\ntheir bulk, has the patience attentively to peruse these Annals, cannot\r\nfail to become well acquainted with all the peculiar features of Hindu\r\nsociety, and will be enabled to trace the foundation and progress of\r\neach State in Rajputana, as well as to form a just notion of the\r\ncharacter of a people, upon whom, at a future period, our existence in\r\nIndia may depend.\r\n\r\nWhatever novelty the inquirer into the origin of nations may find in\r\nthese [viii] pages, I am ambitious to claim for them a higher title than\r\na mass of mere archaeological data. To see humanity under every aspect,\r\nand to observe the influence of different creeds upon man in his social\r\ncapacity, must ever be one of the highest sources of mental enjoyment;\r\nand I may hope that the personal qualities herein delineated, will allow\r\nthe labourer in this vast field of philosophy to enlarge his sphere of\r\nacquaintance with human varieties. In the present circumstances of our\r\nalliance with these States, every trait of national character, and even\r\nevery traditional incident, which, by leading us to understand and\r\nrespect their peculiarities, may enable us to secure their friendship\r\nand esteem, become of infinite importance. The more we study their\r\nhistory, the better shall we comprehend the causes of their\r\ninternational quarrels, the origin of their tributary engagements, the\r\nsecret principles of their mutual repulsion, and the sources of their\r\nstrength and their weakness as an aggregate body: without which\r\nknowledge it is impossible we can arbitrate with justice in their\r\nnational disputes; and, as respects ourselves, we may convert a means of\r\ndefence into a source of bitter hostility.\r\n\r\nIt has been my aim to diversify as much as possible the details of this\r\nvolume. In the Annals of Marwar I have traced the conquest and peopling\r\nof an immense region by a handful of strangers; and have dwelt, perhaps,\r\nwith tedious minuteness on the long reign of Raja Ajit Singh and the\r\nThirty Years’ War; to show what the energy of one of these petty States,\r\nimpelled by a sense of oppression, effected against the colossal power\r\nof its enemies. It is a portion of their history which should be deeply\r\nstudied by those who have succeeded to the paramount power; for\r\nAurangzeb had less reason to distrust the stability of his dominion than\r\nwe have: yet what is now the house of Timur? The resources of Marwar\r\nwere reduced to as low an ebb at the close of Aurangzeb’s reign, as they\r\nare at the present time; yet did that [ix] State surmount all its\r\ndifficulties, and bring armies into the field that annihilated the\r\nforces of the empire. Let us not, then, mistake the supineness\r\nengendered by long oppression, for want of feeling, nor mete out to\r\nthese high-spirited people the same measure of contumely, with which we\r\nhave treated the subjects of our earlier conquests.\r\n\r\nThe Annals of the Bhattis may be considered as the link connecting the\r\ntribes of India Proper with the ancient races west of the Indus, or\r\nIndo-Scythia; and although they will but slightly interest the general\r\nreader, the antiquary may find in them many new topics for\r\ninvestigation, as well as in the Sketch of the Desert, which has\r\npreserved the relics of names that once promised immortality.\r\n\r\nThe patriarchal simplicity of the Jat communities, upon whose ruins the\r\nState of Bikaner was founded, affords a picture, however imperfect, of\r\npetty republics—a form of government little known to eastern despotism,\r\nand proving the tenacity of the ancient Gete’s attachment to liberty.\r\n\r\nAmber, and its scion Shaikhavati, possess a still greater interest from\r\ntheir contiguity to our frontier. A multitude of singular privileges is\r\nattached to the Shaikhavati federation, which it behoves the paramount\r\npower thoroughly to understand, lest it should be led by false views to\r\npursue a policy detrimental to them as well as to ourselves. To this\r\nextensive community belong the Larkhanis, so utterly unknown to us, that\r\na recent internal tumult of that tribe was at first mistaken for an\r\nirruption of our old enemies, the Pindaris.\r\n\r\nHaraoti may claim our regard from the high bearing of its gallant race,\r\nthe Haras; and the singular character of the individual with whose\r\nbiography its history closes, and which cannot fail to impart juster\r\nnotions of the genius of Asiatics [x].\r\n\r\nSo much for the matter of this volume—with regard to the manner, as the\r\nRajputs abhor all pleas _ad misericordiam_, so likewise does their\r\nannalist, who begs to repeat, in order to deprecate a standard of\r\ncriticism inapplicable to this performance, that it professes _not_ to\r\nbe constructed on exact historical principles: _Non historia, sed\r\nparticulae historiae_.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I adopt the peroration of the ingenuous, pious, and\r\nliberal Abu-l Fazl, when completing his History of the Provinces of\r\nIndia; “Praise be unto God, that by the assistance of his Divine Grace,\r\nI have completed the History of the Rajputs. The account cost me a great\r\ndeal of trouble in collecting, and I found such difficulty in\r\nascertaining dates, and in reconciling the contradictions in the several\r\nhistories of the Princes of Rajputana, that I had nearly resolved to\r\nrelinquish the task altogether: but who can resist the decrees of Fate?\r\nI trust that those, who have been able to obtain better information,\r\nwill not dwell upon my errors; but that upon the whole I may meet with\r\napprobation.”[i.34]\r\n\r\n                                         YORK PLACE, PORTMAN SQUARE,\r\n                                                   _March 10, 1832_.\r\n\r\nFootnote i.34:\r\n\r\n  [_Āīn_, ii. 418.]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ANNALS AND ANTIQUITIES\r\n                              OF RAJASTHAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BOOK I\r\n\r\n                  GEOGRAPHY OF RAJASTHAN OR RAJPUTANA\r\n\r\n\r\n=Boundaries of Rajputana.=—Rajasthan is the collective and classical\r\ndenomination of that portion of India which is ‘the abode[1.1] of\r\n(Rajput) princes.’ In the familiar dialect of these countries it is\r\ntermed Rajwara, but by the more refined Raethana, corrupted to\r\nRajputana, the common designation amongst the British to denote the\r\nRajput principalities.\r\n\r\nWhat might have been the nominal extent of Rajasthan prior to the\r\nMuhammadan conqueror Shihabu-d-din (when it probably reached beyond the\r\nJumna and Ganges, even to the base of the Himalaya) cannot now be known.\r\nAt present we may adhere to its restrictive definition, still\r\ncomprehending a wide space and a variety of interesting races.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the erection of the minor Muhammadan monarchies of Mandu and\r\nAhmadabad (the capitals of Malwa and Gujarat), on the ruins of Dhar and\r\nAnhilwara Patan, the term Rajasthan would have been appropriated to the\r\nspace comprehended in the map prefixed to this work: the valley of the\r\nIndus on the west, and Bundelkhand[1.2] on the east; to the north, the\r\nsandy tracts (south of the Sutlej) termed Jangaldes; and the Vindhya\r\nmountains to the south.\r\n\r\nThis space comprehends nearly 8° of latitude and 9° of longitude, being\r\nfrom 22° to 30° north latitude, and 69° to 78° east longitude, embracing\r\na superficial area of 350,000 square miles[1.3] [2].\r\n\r\nAlthough it is proposed to touch upon the annals of all the States in\r\nthis extensive tract, with their past and present condition, those in\r\nthe centre will claim the most prominent regard; especially Mewar,\r\nwhich, copiously treated of, will afford a specimen, obviating the\r\nnecessity of like details of the rest.\r\n\r\n=The States of Rājputāna.=—The order in which these States will be\r\nreviewed is as follows:\r\n\r\n      1. Mewar, or Udaipur.\r\n      2. Marwar, or Jodhpur.\r\n      3. Bikaner and Kishangarh.\r\n      4. Kotah ┐ or Haraoti.\r\n      5. Bundi ┘\r\n      6.

The Indian desert to the valley of the Indus.\r\n\r\n=History of Geographical Surveys.=—The basis of this work is the\r\ngeography of the country, the historical and statistical portion being\r\nconsequent and subordinate thereto. It was, indeed, originally designed\r\nto be essentially geographical; but circumstances have rendered it\r\nimpossible to execute the intended details, or even to make the map[1.4]\r\nso perfect as the superabundant material at the command of the author\r\nmight have enabled him to do; a matter of regret to himself rather than\r\nof loss to the general reader, to whom geographic details, however\r\nimportant, are usually dry and uninteresting.\r\n\r\nIt was also intended to institute a comparison between the map and such\r\nremains of ancient geography as can be extracted from the Puranas and\r\nother Hindu authorities; which, however, must be deferred to a future\r\nperiod, when the deficiency of the present rapid and general sketch may\r\nbe supplied, should the author be enabled to resume his labours.\r\n\r\nThe laborious research, in the course of which these data were\r\naccumulated, commenced in 1806, when the author was attached to the\r\nembassy sent, at the close of the Mahratta wars, to the court of\r\nSindhia. This chieftain’s army was then in Mewar, at that period almost\r\na _terra incognita_, the position of whose two capitals, Udaipur and\r\nChitor, in the best existing maps, was precisely reversed [3]; that is,\r\nChitor was inserted S.E. of Udaipur instead of E.N.E., a proof of the\r\nscanty knowledge possessed at that period.\r\n\r\nIn other respects there was almost a total blank. In the maps prior to\r\n1806 nearly all the western and central States of Rajasthan will be\r\nfound wanting. It had been imagined, but a little time before, that the\r\nrivers had a southerly course into the Nerbudda; a notion corrected by\r\nthe father of Indian geography, the distinguished Rennell.[1.5]\r\n\r\nThis blank the author filled up; and in 1815, for the first time, the\r\ngeography of Rajasthan was put into combined form and presented to the\r\nMarquess of Hastings, on the eve of a general war, when the labour of\r\nten years was amply rewarded by its becoming in part the foundation of\r\nthat illustrious commander’s plans of the campaign. It is a duty owing\r\nto himself to state that every map, without exception, printed since\r\nthis period has its foundation, as regards Central and Western India, in\r\nthe labours of the author.[1.6]\r\n\r\n=The Author’s Surveys.=—The route of the embassy was from Agra, through\r\nthe southern frontier of Jaipur to Udaipur. A portion of this had been\r\nsurveyed and points laid down from celestial observation, by Dr. W.\r\nHunter, which I adopted as the basis of my enterprise. The Resident\r\nEnvoy[1.7] to the court of Sindhia was possessed of the valuable sketch\r\nof the route of Colonel Palmer’s embassy in 1791, as laid down by Dr.\r\nHunter, the foundation of my subsequent surveys, as it merited from its\r\nimportance and general accuracy. It embraced all the extreme points of\r\nCentral India: Agra, Narwar, Datia, Jhansi, Bhopal, Sarangpur, Ujjain,\r\nand on return from this, the first meridian of the Hindus, by Kotah,\r\nBundi, Rampura (Tonk), Bayana, to Agra. The position of all these places\r\nwas more or less accurately fixed, according to the time which could be\r\nbestowed, by astronomical observation [4].\r\n\r\nAt Rampura Hunter ceased to be my guide: and from this point commenced\r\nthe new survey of Udaipur, where we arrived in June 1806. The position\r\nthen assigned to it, with most inadequate instruments, has been changed\r\nonly 1´of longitude, though the latitude amounted to about 5´.\r\n\r\nFrom Udaipur the subsequent march of the army with which we moved led\r\npast the celebrated Chitor, and through the centre of Malwa, crossing in\r\ndetail all the grand streams flowing from the Vindhya, till we halted\r\nfor a season on the Bundelkhand frontier at Khimlasa. In this journey of\r\nseven hundred miles I twice crossed the lines of route of the former\r\nembassy, and was gratified to find my first attempts generally coincide\r\nwith their established points.\r\n\r\nIn 1807, the army having undertaken the siege of Rahatgarh, I determined\r\nto avail myself of the time which Mahrattas waste in such a process, and\r\nto pursue my favourite project. With a small guard I determined to push\r\nthrough untrodden fields, by the banks of the Betwa to Chanderi, and in\r\nits latitude proceed in a westerly direction towards Kotah, trace the\r\ncourse once more of all those streams from the south, and the points of\r\njunction of the most important (the Kali Sind, Parbati, and Banas) with\r\nthe Chambal; and having effected this, continue my journey to Agra. This\r\nI accomplished in times very different from the present, being often\r\nobliged to strike my tents and march at midnight, and more than once the\r\nobject of plunder.[1.8] The chief points in this route were Khimlasa,\r\nRajwara, Kotra on the Betwa, Kanyadana,[1.9] Buradungar,[1.10] Shahabad,\r\nBarah,[1.11] Puleta,[1.12] Baroda, Sheopur, Pali,[1.13] Ranthambhor,\r\nKarauli, Sri Mathura, and Agra.\r\n\r\nOn my return to the Mahratta camp I resolved further to increase the\r\nsphere, and proceeded westward by Bharatpur, Katumbar, Sentri, to\r\nJaipur, Tonk, Indargarh, Gugal Chhapra, Raghugarh, Aron, Kurwai, Borasa,\r\nto Sagar: a journey of more than one thousand miles. I found the camp\r\nnearly where I left it.\r\n\r\nWith this ambulatory court I moved everywhere within this region,\r\nconstantly employed in surveying till 1812, when Sindhia’s court became\r\nstationary. It was then I formed my plans for obtaining a knowledge of\r\nthose countries into which I could not personally penetrate [5].\r\n\r\n=Survey Parties.=—In 1810-11 I had despatched two parties, one to the\r\nIndus, the other to the desert south of the Sutlej. The first party,\r\nunder Shaikh Abu-l Barakat, journeyed westward, by Udaipur, through\r\nGujarat, Saurashtra and Cutch, Lakhpat and Hyderabad (the capital of the\r\nSindi government); crossed the Indus to Tatta, proceeded up the right\r\nbank to Sehwan; recrossed, and continued on the left bank as far as\r\nKhairpur, the residence of one of the triumvirate governors of Sind, and\r\nhaving reached the insulated Bakhar[1.14] (the capital of the Sogdoi of\r\nAlexander), returned by the desert of Umrasumra to Jaisalmer, Marwar,\r\nand Jaipur, and joined me in camp at Narwar. It was a perilous\r\nundertaking; but the Shaikh was a fearless and enterprising character,\r\nand moreover a man with some tincture of learning. His journals\r\ncontained many hints and directions for future research in the\r\ngeography, statistics, and manners of the various races amongst whom he\r\ntravelled.\r\n\r\nThe other party was conducted by a most valuable man, Madari Lal, who\r\nbecame a perfect adept in these expeditions of geographical discovery,\r\nand other knowledge resulting therefrom. There is not a district of any\r\nconsequence in the wide space before the reader which was not traversed\r\nby this spirited individual, whose qualifications for such complicated\r\nand hazardous journeys were never excelled. Ardent, persevering,\r\nprepossessing, and generally well-informed, he made his way when others\r\nmight have perished.[1.15]\r\n\r\nFrom these remote regions the best-informed native inhabitants were, by\r\npersuasion and recompense, conducted to me; and I could at all times, in\r\nthe Mahratta camp at Gwalior, from 1812 to 1817, have provided a native\r\nof the valley of the Indus, the deserts of Dhat, Umrasumra, or any of\r\nthe States of Rajasthan.\r\n\r\nThe precision with which Kasids and other public conveyers of letters,\r\nin countries where posts are little used, can detail the peculiarities\r\nof a long line of route, and the accuracy of their distances would\r\nscarcely be credited in Europe. I have no hesitation in asserting that\r\nif a correct estimate were obtained of the measured [6] coss of a\r\ncountry, a line might be laid down upon a flat surface with great\r\nexactitude. I have heard it affirmed that it was the custom of the old\r\nHindu governments to have measurements made of the roads from town to\r\ntown, and that the _Abu Mahatma_[1.16] contains a notice of an\r\ninstrument for that purpose. Indeed, the singular coincidence between\r\nlines measured by the perambulator and the estimated distances of the\r\nnatives is the best proof that the latter are deduced from some more\r\ncertain method than mere computation.\r\n\r\nI never rested satisfied with the result of one set of my parties, with\r\nthe single exception of Madari’s, always making the information of one a\r\nbasis for the instruction of another, who went over the same ground; but\r\nwith additional views and advantages, and with the aid of the natives\r\nbrought successively by each, till I exhausted every field.\r\n\r\nThus, in a few years, I had filled several volumes with lines of route\r\nthroughout this space; and having many frontier and intermediate points,\r\nthe positions of which were fixed, a general outline of the result was\r\nconstructed, wherein all this information was laid down. I speak more\r\nparticularly of the western States, as the central portion, or that\r\nwatered by the Chambal and its tributary streams, whether from the\r\nelevated Aravalli on the west, or from the Vindhya mountains on the\r\nsouth, has been personally surveyed and measured in every direction,\r\nwith an accuracy sufficient for every political or military purpose,\r\nuntil the grand trigonometrical survey from the peninsula shall be\r\nextended throughout India. These countries form an extended plain to the\r\nSutlej north, and west to the Indus, rendering the amalgamation of\r\ngeographical materials much less difficult than where mountainous\r\nregions intervene.\r\n\r\nAfter having laid down these varied lines in the outline described, I\r\ndetermined to check and confirm its accuracy by recommencing the survey\r\non a new plan, viz. trigonometrically.\r\n\r\nMy parties were again despatched to resume their labours over fields now\r\nfamiliar to them. They commenced from points whose positions were fixed\r\n(and my knowledge enabled me to give a series of such), from each of\r\nwhich, as a centre, they collected every radiating route to every town\r\nwithin the distance of twenty miles. The points selected were generally\r\nsuch as to approach equilateral [7] triangles; and although to digest\r\nthe information became a severe toil, the method will appear, even to\r\nthe casual observer, one which must throw out its own errors; for these\r\nlines crossed in every direction, and consequently corrected each other.\r\nBy such means did I work my way in those unknown tracts, and the result\r\nis in part before the reader. I say, in part; for my health compels me\r\nreluctantly to leave out much which could be combined from ten folios of\r\njourneys extending throughout these regions.\r\n\r\n=The Author’s Map.=—In 1815, as before stated, an outline map containing\r\nall the information thus obtained, and which the subsequent crisis\r\nrendered of essential importance, was presented by me to the\r\nGovernor-General of India. Upon the very eve of the war I constructed\r\nand presented another, of the greater portion of Malwa, to which it\r\nappeared expedient to confine the operations against the Pindaris. The\r\nmaterial feature in this small map was the general position of the\r\nVindhya mountains, the sources and course of every river originating\r\nthence, and the passes in this chain, an object of primary importance.\r\nThe boundaries of the various countries in this tract were likewise\r\ndefined, and it became essentially useful in the subsequent\r\ndismemberment of the Peshwa’s dominions.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of this map I had many fixed points, both of Dr.\r\nHunter’s and my own, to work from; and it is gratifying to observe that\r\nthough several measured lines have since been run through this space,\r\nnot only the general, but often the identical features of mine have been\r\npreserved in the maps since given to the world. As considerable\r\nimprovement has been made by several measured lines through this tract,\r\nand many positions affixed by a scientific and zealous geographer, I\r\nhave had no hesitation in incorporating a small portion of this improved\r\ngeography in the map now presented.[1.17]\r\n\r\nMany surveyed lines were made by me from 1817 to 1822; and here I\r\nexpress my obligations to my kinsman,[1.18] to whom alone I owe any aid\r\nfor improving this portion of my geographical labours. This officer made\r\na circuitous survey, which comprehended nearly the extreme points of\r\nMewar, from the capital, by Chitor, Mandalgarh, Jahazpur, Rajmahall, and\r\nin return by Banai, Badnor, Deogarh [8], to the point of outset. From\r\nthese extreme points he was enabled to place many intermediate ones, for\r\nwhich Mewar is so favourable, by reason of its isolated hills.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 I made an important journey across the Aravalli, by Kumbhalmer,\r\nPali, to Jodhpur, the capital of Marwar, and thence by Merta, tracing\r\nthe course of the Luni to its source at Ajmer; and from this celebrated\r\nresidence of the Chauhan kings and Mogul emperors; returning through the\r\ncentral lands of Mewar, by Banai and Banera, to the capital.\r\n\r\nI had the peculiar satisfaction to find that my position of Jodhpur,\r\nwhich has been used as a capital point in fixing the geography west and\r\nnorth, was only 3´ of space out in latitude, and little more in\r\nlongitude; which accounted for the coincidence of my position of Bikaner\r\nwith that assigned by Mr. Elphinstone in his account of the embassy to\r\nKabul.\r\n\r\nBesides Udaipur, Jodhpur, Ajmer, etc., whose positions I had fixed by\r\nobservations, and the points laid down by Hunter, I availed myself of a\r\nfew positions given to me by that enterprising traveller, the author of\r\nthe journey into Khorasan,[1.19] who marched from Delhi, by Nagor and\r\nJodhpur, to Udaipur.\r\n\r\nThe outline of the countries of Gujarat,[1.20] the Saurashtra peninsula,\r\nand Cutch, inserted chiefly by way of connexion, is entirely taken from\r\nthe labours of that distinguished geographer, the late General Reynolds.\r\nWe had both gone over a great portion of the same field, and my\r\ntestimony is due to the value of his researches in countries into which\r\nhe never personally penetrated, evincing what may be done by industry,\r\nand the use of such materials as I have described.\r\n\r\n=Physiography of Rājputāna.=—I shall conclude with a rapid sketch of the\r\nphysiognomy of these regions; minute and local descriptions will appear\r\nmore appropriately in the respective historical portions.\r\n\r\nRajasthan presents a great variety of feature. Let me place the reader\r\non the highest peak of the insulated Abu, ‘the saint’s pinnacle,’[1.21]\r\nas it is termed, and guide his eye in a survey over this wide expanse,\r\nfrom the ‘blue waters’ of the Indus west to the ‘withy-covered’[1.22]\r\nBetwa on the east. From this, the most [9] elevated spot in Hindustan,\r\noverlooking by fifteen hundred feet the Aravalli mountains, his eye\r\ndescends to the plains of Medpat[1.23] (the classic term for Mewar),\r\nwhose chief streams, flowing from the base of the Aravalli, join the\r\nBerach and Banas, and are prevented from uniting with the Chambal only\r\nby the Patar[1.24] or plateau of Central India.\r\n\r\nAscending this plateau near the celebrated Chitor, let the eye deviate\r\nslightly from the direct eastern line, and pursue the only practicable\r\npath by Ratangarh, and Singoli, to Kotah, and he will observe its three\r\nsuccessive steppes, the miniature representation of those of Russian\r\nTartary. Let the observer here glance across the Chambal and traverse\r\nHaraoti to its eastern frontier, guarded by the fortress of Shahabad:\r\nthence abruptly descend the plateau to the level of the Sind, still\r\nproceeding eastward, until the table-mountain, the western limit of\r\nBundelkhand, affords a resting-point.\r\n\r\nTo render this more distinct, I present a profile of the tract described\r\nfrom Abu to Kotra on the Betwa:[1.25] from Abu to the Chambal, the\r\nresult of barometrical measurement, and from the latter to the Betwa\r\nfrom my general observations[1.26] of the irregularities of surface. The\r\nresult is, that the Betwa at Kotra is one thousand feet above the\r\nsea-level, and one thousand lower than the city and valley of Udaipur,\r\nwhich again is on the same level with the base of Abu, two thousand feet\r\nabove the sea. This line, the general direction of which is but a short\r\ndistance from the tropic, is about six geographic degrees in length: yet\r\nis this small space highly diversified, both in its inhabitants and the\r\nproduction of the soil, whether hidden or revealed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nSection thro’ Central India in 25° N.

Though, from our elevated stand on ‘the\r\nSaint’s Pinnacle’ of Abu, we look down on the Vindhya as a range of\r\ndiminished importance, it is that our position is the least favourable\r\nto viewing its grandeur, which would be most apparent from the south;\r\nthough throughout this skirt of descent, irregular elevations attain a\r\nheight of many hundred feet above such points of its abrupt descent.\r\n\r\nThe Aravalli itself may be said to connect with the Vindhya, and the\r\npoint of junction to be towards Champaner; though it might be as correct\r\nto say the Aravalli thence rose upon and stretched from the Vindhya.\r\nWhilst it is much less elevated than more to the north, it presents bold\r\nfeatures throughout,[1.29] south by Lunawara, Dungarpur, and Idar, to\r\nAmba Bhawani and Udaipur.\r\n\r\nStill looking from Abu over the tableland of Malwa, we observe her\r\nplains of black loam furrowed by the numerous streams from the highest\r\npoints of the Vindhya, pursuing their northerly course; some meandering\r\nthrough valleys or falling over precipices; others bearing down all\r\nopposition, and actually forcing an exit through the central plateau to\r\njoin the Chambal.\r\n\r\n=The Aravalli Range.=—Having thus glanced at the south, let us cast the\r\neye north of this line, and pause on the alpine Aravalli.[1.30] Let us\r\ntake a section of it, from the capital, Udaipur, the line of our station\r\non Abu, passing through Oghna Panarwa, and Mirpur, to the western\r\ndescent near Sirohi, a space of nearly sixty miles in a direct line,\r\nwhere “hills o’er hills and alps on alps arise,” from the ascent at\r\nUdaipur, to the descent to Marwar. All this space to the Sirohi frontier\r\nis inhabited by communities of the aboriginal races, living in a state\r\nof primeval and almost savage independence, owning no paramount power,\r\npaying no tribute, but with all the simplicity of republics; their\r\nleaders, with the title of Rawat, being hereditary. Thus the Rawat of\r\nthe Oghna commune can assemble five thousand bows, and several others\r\n[11] can on occasion muster considerable numbers. Their habitations are\r\ndispersed through the valleys in small rude hamlets, near their pastures\r\nor places of defence.[1.31]\r\n\r\nLet me now transport the reader to the citadel pinnacle of\r\nKumbhalmer,[1.32] thence surveying the range running north to Ajmer,\r\nwhere, shortly after, it loses its tabular form, and breaking into lofty\r\nridges, sends numerous branches through the Shaikhavati federation, and\r\nAlwar, till in low heights it terminates at Delhi.\r\n\r\nFrom Kumbhalmer to Ajmer the whole space is termed Merwāra, and is\r\ninhabited by the mountain race of Mer or Mair, the habits and history of\r\nwhich singular class will be hereafter related. The range averages from\r\nsix to fifteen miles in breadth, having upwards of one hundred and fifty\r\nvillages and hamlets scattered over its valleys and rocks, abundantly\r\nwatered, not deficient in pasture, and with cultivation enough for all\r\ninternal wants, though it is raised with infinite labour on terraces, as\r\nthe vine is cultivated in Switzerland and on the Rhine.\r\n\r\nIn vain does the eye search for any trace of wheel-carriage across this\r\ncompound range from Idar to Ajmer; and it consequently well merits its\r\nappellation _ara_, ‘the barrier,’ for the strongest arm of modern\r\nwarfare, artillery, would have to turn the chain by the north to avoid\r\nthe impracticable descent to the west.[1.33]\r\n\r\n=Views from the Aravalli Hills.=—Guiding the eye along the chain,\r\nseveral fortresses are observed on pinnacles guarding the passes on\r\neither side, while numerous rills descend, pouring over the declivities,\r\nseeking their devious exit between the projecting ribs of the mountain.\r\nThe Berach, the Banas, the Kothari, the Khari, the Dahi all unite with\r\nthe Banas to the east, while to the west the still more numerous streams\r\nwhich fertilize the rich province of Godwar, unite to ‘the Salt River,’\r\nthe Luni, and mark the true line of the desert. Of these the chief are\r\nthe Sukri and the [12] Bandi; while others which are not perennial, and\r\ndepend on atmospheric causes for their supply, receive the general\r\ndenomination of _rela_, indicative of rapid mountain torrents, carrying\r\nin their descent a vast volume of alluvial deposit, to enrich the\r\nsiliceous soil below.\r\n\r\nHowever grand the view of the chaotic mass of rock from this elevated\r\nsite of Kumbhalmer, it is from the plains of Marwar that its majesty is\r\nmost apparent; where its ‘splintered pinnacles’ are seen rising over\r\neach other in varied form, or frowning over the dark indented recesses\r\nof its forest-covered and rugged declivities.\r\n\r\nOn reflection, I am led to pronounce the Aravalli a connexion of the\r\n‘Apennines of India’; the Ghats on the Malabar coast of the peninsula:\r\nnor does the passage of the Nerbudda or the Tapti, through its\r\ndiminished centre, militate against the hypothesis, which might be\r\nbetter substantiated by the comparison of their intrinsic character and\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n=Geology of the Aravallis.=—The general character of the Aravalli is its\r\nprimitive formation:[1.34] granite, reposing in variety of angle (the\r\ngeneral dip is to the east) on massive, compact, dark blue slate, the\r\nlatter rarely appearing much above the surface or base of the\r\nsuperincumbent granite. The internal valleys abound in variegated quartz\r\nand a variety of schistous slate of every hue, which gives a most\r\nsingular appearance to the roofs of the houses and temples when the sun\r\nshines upon them. Rocks of gneiss and of syenite appear in the\r\nintervals; and in the diverging ridges west of Ajmer the summits are\r\nquite dazzling with the enormous masses of vitreous rose-coloured\r\nquartz.\r\n\r\nThe Aravalli and its subordinate hills are rich in both mineral and\r\nmetallic products; and, as stated in the annals of Mewar, to the latter\r\nalone can be attributed the resources which enabled this family so long\r\nto struggle against superior power, and to raise those magnificent\r\nstructures which would do honour to the most potent kingdoms of the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nThe mines are royalties; their produce a monopoly, increasing the\r\npersonal revenue of their prince. _An-Dan-Khan_ is a triple figurative\r\nexpression, which comprehends the sum of sovereign rights in Rajasthan,\r\nbeing _allegiance_, _commercial duties_, _mines_. The tin-mines of Mewar\r\nwere once very productive, and yielded, it is asserted, no\r\ninconsiderable portion of silver: but the caste of miners is extinct,\r\nand political reasons, during the Mogul domination, led to the [13]\r\nconcealment of such sources of wealth. Copper of a very fine description\r\nis likewise abundant, and supplies the currency; and the chief of\r\nSalumbar even coins by sufferance from the mines on his own estate.\r\n_Surma_, or the oxide of antimony, is found on the western frontier. The\r\ngarnet, amethystine quartz, rock crystal, the chrysolite, and inferior\r\nkinds of the emerald family are all to be found within Mewar; and though\r\nI have seen no specimens decidedly valuable, the Rana has often told me\r\nthat, according to tradition, his native hills contained every species\r\nof mineral wealth.\r\n\r\n=The Patār Plateau.=—Let us now quit our alpine station on the Aravalli,\r\nand make a tour of the _Patar_, or plateau of Central India, not the\r\nleast important feature of this interesting region. It possesses a most\r\ndecided character, and is distinct from the Vindhya to the south and the\r\nAravalli to the west, being of the secondary formation, or trap, of the\r\nmost regular horizontal stratification.\r\n\r\nThe circumference of the plateau is best explained in the map, though\r\nits surface is most unequally detailed, and is continually alternating\r\nits character between the tabular form and clustering ridges.\r\n\r\nCommencing the tour of Mandalgarh, let us proceed south, skirting Chitor\r\n(both on insulated rocks detached from the plateau), thence by Jawad,\r\nDantoli, Rampura,[1.35] Bhanpura, the Mukunddarra Pass,[1.36] to Gagraun\r\n(where the Kali Sind forces an entrance through its table-barrier to\r\nEklera)[1.37] and Margwas (where the Parbati, taking advantage of the\r\ndiminished elevation, passes from Malwa to Haraoti), and by Raghugarh,\r\nShahabad, Ghazigarh, Gaswani, to Jadonwati, where the plateau terminates\r\non the Chambal, east; while from the same point of outset, Mandalgarh,\r\nsoon losing much of its table form, it stretches away in bold ranges,\r\noccasionally tabular, as in the Bundi fortress, by Dablana,\r\nIndargarh,[1.38] and Lakheri,[1.38] to Ranthambhor and Karauli,\r\nterminating at Dholpur Bari.\r\n\r\nThe elevation and inequalities of this plateau are best seen by crossing\r\nit from west to east, from the plains to the level of the Chambal,\r\nwhere, with the exception of the short flat between Kotah and Pali\r\nferry, this noble stream is seen rushing through the rocky barrier.\r\n\r\nAt Ranthambhor the plateau breaks into lofty ranges, their white summits\r\n[14] sparkling in the sun; cragged but not peaked, and preserving the\r\ncharacteristic formation, though disunited from the mass. Here there are\r\nno less than seven distinct ranges (_Satpara_), through all of which the\r\nBanas has to force a passage to unite with the Chambal. Beyond\r\nRanthambhor, and the whole way from Karauli to the river, is an\r\nirregular tableland, on the edge of whose summit are the fortresses of\r\nUtgir, Mandrel, and that more celebrated of Thun. But east of the\r\neastern side there is still another steppe of descent, which may be said\r\nto originate near the fountain of the Sind at Latoti, and passing by\r\nChanderi, Kanyadana, Narwar, and Gwalior, terminates at Deogarh, in the\r\nplains of Gohad. The descent from this second steppe is into Bundelkhand\r\nand the valley of the Betwa.\r\n\r\nDistinguished as is this elevated region of the surface of Central\r\nIndia, its summit is but little higher than the general elevation of the\r\ncrest of the Vindhya, and upon a level with the valley of Udaipur and\r\nbase of the Aravalli. The slope or descent, therefore, from both these\r\nranges to the skirts of the plateau is great and abrupt, of which the\r\nmost intelligible and simple proof appears in the course of these\r\nstreams. Few portions of the globe attest more powerfully the force\r\nexerted by the action of waters to subdue every obstacle, than a view of\r\nthe rock-bound channels of these streams in this adamantine barrier.\r\nFour streams—one of which, the Chambal, would rank with the Rhine and\r\nalmost with the Rhone—have here forced their way, laying bare the\r\nstratification from the water’s level to the summit, from three to six\r\nhundred feet in perpendicular height, the rock appearing as if chiselled\r\nby the hand of man. Here the geologist may read the book of nature in\r\ndistinct character; few tracts (from Rampura to Kotah) will be found\r\nmore interesting to him, to the antiquarian, or to the lover of nature\r\nin her most rugged attire.\r\n\r\nThe surface of this extensive plateau is greatly diversified. At Kotah\r\nthe bare protruding rock in some places presents not a trace of\r\nvegetation; but where it bevels off to the banks of the Par it is one of\r\nthe richest and most productive soils in India, and better cultivated\r\nthan any spot even of British India. In its indented sides are glens of\r\nthe most romantic description (as the fountain of ‘the snake King’ near\r\nHinglaj), and deep dells, the source of small streams, where many\r\ntreasures of art,[1.39] in temples and ancient dwellings, yet remain to\r\nreward the traveller [15].\r\n\r\nThis central elevation, as before described, is of the secondary\r\nformation, called trap. Its prevailing colour, where laid bare by the\r\nChambal, is milk-white: it is compact and close-grained, and though\r\nperhaps the mineral offering the greatest resistance to the chisel, the\r\nsculptures at the celebrated Barolli evince its utility to the artist.\r\nWhite is also the prevailing colour to the westward. About Kotah it is\r\noften mixed white and porphyritic, and about Shahabad of a mixed red and\r\nbrown tint. When exposed to the action of the atmosphere in its eastern\r\ndeclivity the decomposed and rough surface would almost cause it to be\r\nmistaken for gritstone.\r\n\r\nThis formation is not favourable to mineral wealth. The only metals are\r\nlead and iron; but their ores, especially the latter, are abundant.\r\nThere are mines, said to be of value, of sulphuret of lead (_galena_) in\r\nthe Gwalior province, from which I have had specimens, but these also\r\nare closed. The natives fear to extract their mineral wealth; and though\r\nabounding in lead, tin, and copper, they are indebted almost entirely to\r\nEurope even for the materials of their culinary utensils.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting a delineation of inferior ranges, I will only further\r\ndirect the reader’s attention to an important deduction from this\r\nsuperficial review of the physiognomy of Rajwara.\r\n\r\n=The Mountain System of Central India.=—There are two distinctly marked\r\ndeclivities or slopes in Central India: the chief is that from west to\r\neast, from the great rampart, the Aravalli (interposed to prevent the\r\ndrifting of the sands into the central plains, bisected by the Chambal\r\nand his hundred arms) to the Betwa; the other slope is from south to\r\nnorth, from the Vindhya, the southern buttress of Central India, to the\r\nJumna.\r\n\r\nExtending our definition, we may pronounce the course of the Jumna to\r\nindicate the central fall of that immense vale which has its northern\r\nslope from the base of the Himalaya, and the southern from that of the\r\nVindhya mountains.\r\n\r\nIt is not in contemplation to delineate the varied course of the\r\nmagnificent Nerbudda, though I have abundant means; for the moment we\r\nascend the summit of the tropical[1.40] Vindhya, to descend into the\r\nvalley of the Nerbudda, we abandon Rajasthan and the Rajputs for the\r\naboriginal races, the first proprietors of the land. These I shall leave\r\nto others, and commence and end with the Chambal, the paramount lord of\r\nthe floods of Central India [16].\r\n\r\n=The Chambal River.=—The Chambal has his fountains in a very elevated\r\npoint of the Vindhya, amidst a cluster of hills on which is bestowed the\r\nlocal appellation of Janapao. It has three co-equal sources from the\r\nsame cluster, the Chambal, Chambela, and Gambhir; while no less than\r\nnine other streams have their origin on the south side, and pour their\r\nwaters into the Nerbudda.\r\n\r\nThe Sipra from Pipalda, the little Sind[1.41] from Dewas, and other\r\nminor streams passing Ujjain, all unite with the Chambal in different\r\nstages before he breaks through the plateau.\r\n\r\nThe Kali Sind, from Bagri, and its petty branch, the Sodwia, from\r\nRaghugarh; the Niwaz (or Jamniri), from Morsukri and Magarda; the\r\nParbati, from the pass of Amlakhera, with its more eastern arm from\r\nDaulatpur, uniting at Pharhar, are all points in the crest of the\r\nVindhya range, whence they pursue their course through the plateau,\r\nrolling over precipices,[1.42] till engulfed in the Chambal at the\r\nferries of Nunera and Pali. All these unite on the right bank.\r\n\r\nOn the left bank his flood is increased by the Banas, fed by the\r\nperennial streams from the Aravalli, and the Berach from the lakes of\r\nUdaipur; and after watering Mewar, the southern frontier of Jaipur, and\r\nthe highlands of Karauli, the river turns south to unite at the holy\r\nSangam,[1.43] Rameswar. Minor streams contribute (unworthy, however, of\r\nseparate notice), and after a thousand involutions he reaches the Jumna,\r\nat the holy Triveni,[1.44] or ‘triple-allied’ stream, between Etawa and\r\nKalpi.\r\n\r\nThe course of the Chambal, not reckoning the minor sinuosities, is\r\nupwards of five hundred miles;[1.45] and along its banks specimens of\r\nnearly every race now existing in India may be found: Sondis,\r\nChandarawats, Sesodias, Haras, Gaur, Jadon, Sakarwal, Gujar, Jat,[1.46]\r\nTuar, Chauhan, Bhadauria, Kachhwaha, Sengar, Bundela; each in\r\nassociations of various magnitudes, from the substantive state of the\r\nlittle republic communes between the Chambal and Kuwari[1.47] [17].\r\n\r\n=The Western Desert.=—Having thus sketched the central portion of\r\nRajasthan, or that eastward of the Aravalli, I shall give a rapid\r\ngeneral[1.48] view of that to the west, conducting the reader over the\r\n‘Thal ka Tiba,’ or ‘sand hills’ of the desert, to the valley of the\r\nIndus.\r\n\r\n=The Luni River.=—Let the reader again take post on Abu, by which he may\r\nbe saved a painful journey over the Thal.[1.49] The most interesting\r\nobject in this arid ‘region of death’ is the ‘salt river,’ the Luni,\r\nwith its many arms falling from the Aravalli to enrich the best portion\r\nof the principality of Jodhpur, and distinctly marking the line of that\r\nextensive plain of ever-shifting sand, termed in Hindu geography\r\nMarusthali, corrupted to Marwar.\r\n\r\nThe Luni, from its sources, the sacred lakes of Pushkar and Ajmer, and\r\nthe more remote arm from Parbatsar to its embouchure in the great\r\nwestern salt marsh, the Rann, has a course of more than three hundred\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIn the term Eirinon of the historians of Alexander, we have the\r\ncorruption of the word Ran or Rann,[1.50] still used to describe that\r\nextensive fen formed by the deposits of the Luni, and the equally\r\nsaturated saline streams from the southern desert of Dhat. It is one\r\nhundred and fifty miles in length; and where broadest, from Bhuj to\r\nBaliari, about seventy:[1.51] in which direction the caravans cross,\r\nhaving as a place of halt an insulated oasis in this mediterranean salt\r\nmarsh. In the dry season, nothing meets the eye but an extensive and\r\nglaring sheet of salt, spread over its insidious surface, full of\r\ndangerous quicksands: and in the rains it is a dirty saline solution, up\r\nto the camels’ girths in many places. The little oasis, the Khari Kaba,\r\nfurnishes pasture for this useful animal and rest for the traveller\r\npursuing his journey to either bank.\r\n\r\n=The Mirage.=—It is on the desiccated borders[1.52] of this vast salt\r\nmarsh that the illusory phenomenon, the mirage, presents its fantastic\r\nappearance, pleasing to all but the wearied traveller, who sees a haven\r\nof rest in the embattled towers, the peaceful hamlet,[1.53] [18] or\r\nshady grove, to which he hastens in vain; receding as he advances, till\r\n“the sun in his might,” dissipating these “cloud-capp’d towers,” reveals\r\nthe vanity of his pursuit.\r\n\r\nSuch phenomena are common to the desert, more particularly where these\r\nextensive saline depositions exist, but varying from certain causes. In\r\nmost cases, this powerfully magnifying and reflecting medium is a\r\nvertical stratum; at first dense and opaque, it gradually attenuates\r\nwith increased temperature, till the maximum of heat, which it can no\r\nlonger resist, drives it off in an ethereal vapour. This optical\r\ndeception, well known to the Rajputs, is called _sikot_, or ‘winter\r\ncastles,’ because chiefly visible in the cold season: hence, possibly,\r\noriginated the equally illusory and delightful ‘Chateau en Espagne,’ so\r\nwell known in the west.[1.54]\r\n\r\n=The Desert.=—From the north bank of the Luni to the south, and the\r\nShaikhavat frontier to the east, the sandy region commences. Bikaner,\r\nJodhpur, Jaisalmer are all sandy plains, increasing in volume as you\r\nproceed westward. All this portion of territory is incumbent on a\r\nsandstone formation: soundings of all the new wells made from Jodhpur to\r\nAjmer yielded the same result: sand, concrete siliceous deposits, and\r\nchalk.\r\n\r\nJaisalmer is everywhere encircled by desert; and that portion round the\r\ncapital might not be improperly termed an oasis, in which wheat, barley,\r\nand even rice are produced. The fortress is erected on the extremity of\r\na range of some hundred feet in elevation, which can be traced beyond\r\nits southern confines to the ruins of the ancient Chhotan erected upon\r\nthem, and which tradition has preserved as the capital of a tribe, or\r\nprince, termed Hapa, of whom no other trace exists. It is not unlikely\r\nthat this ridge may be connected with that which runs through the rich\r\nprovince of Jalor; consequently an offset from the base of Abu.\r\n\r\nThough all these regions collectively bear the term Marusthali, or\r\n‘region of death’ (the emphatic and figurative phrase for the desert),\r\nthe restrictive definition applies to a part only, that under the\r\ndominion of the Rathor race [19].\r\n\r\nFrom Balotra on the Luni, throughout the whole of Dhat and Umrasumra,\r\nthe western portion of Jaisalmer, and a broad strip between the southern\r\nlimits of Daudputra and Bikaner, there is real solitude and desolation.\r\nBut from the Sutlej to the Rann, a space of five hundred miles of\r\nlongitudinal distance, and varying in breadth from fifty to one hundred\r\nmiles, numerous oases are found, where the shepherds from the valley of\r\nthe Indus and the Thal pasture their flocks. The springs of water in\r\nthese places have various appellations, _tar_, _par_, _rar_, _dar_, all\r\nexpressive of the element, round which assemble the Rajars, Sodhas,\r\nMangalias, and Sahariyas,[1.55] inhabiting the desert.\r\n\r\nI will not touch on the salt lakes or natron beds, or the other products\r\nof the desert, vegetable or mineral; though the latter might soon be\r\ndescribed, being confined to the jasper rock near Jaisalmer, which has\r\nbeen much used in the beautiful arabesques of that fairy fabric, at\r\nAgra, the mausoleum of Shah Jahan’s queen.\r\n\r\nNeither shall I describe the valley of the Indus, or that portion\r\neastward of the stream, the termination of the sand ridges of the\r\ndesert. I will merely remark, that the small stream which breaks from\r\nthe Indus at Dara, seven miles north of the insulated Bakhar, and falls\r\ninto the ocean at Lakhpat, shows the breadth of this eastern portion of\r\nthe valley, which forms the western boundary of the desert. A traveller\r\nproceeding from the Khichi or flats of Sind to the east, sees the line\r\nof the desert distinctly marked, with its elevated _tibas_ or sand\r\nridges under which flows the Sankra, which is generally dry except at\r\nperiodical inundations. These sand-hills are of considerable elevation,\r\nand may be considered the limit of the inundation of the ‘sweet river,’\r\nthe Mitha Maran, a Scythic or Tatar name for river, and by which alone\r\nthe Indus is known, from the Panjnad[1.56] to the ocean [20].\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.1:\r\n\r\n  Or ‘regal (_rāj_) dwelling (_thān_).‘\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.2:\r\n\r\n  It is rather singular that the Sind River will mark this eastern\r\n  boundary, as does the Indus (or great Sind) that to the west. East of\r\n  this minor Sind the Hindu princes are not of pure blood, and are\r\n  excluded from Rajasthan or Rajwara.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.3:\r\n\r\n  [Rājputāna, as now officially defined, lies between lat. 23° 3´ and\r\n  30° 12´ N., and long. 69° 30´ and 78° 17´ E., the total area,\r\n  according to the Census Report, 1911, including Ajmer-Merwāra, being\r\n  131,698 square miles.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.4:\r\n\r\n  Engraved by that meritorious artist Mr. Walker, engraver to the East\r\n  India Company, who, I trust, will be able to make a fuller use of my\r\n  materials hereafter.

Transcripts were made which were\r\n  brought to Europe, and portions introduced into every recent map of\r\n  India. One map has, indeed, been given, in a manner to induce a\r\n  supposition that the furnisher of the materials was the author of\r\n  them. It has fulfilled a prediction of the Marquess of Hastings, who,\r\n  foreseeing the impossibility of such materials remaining private\r\n  property, “and the danger of their being appropriated by others,” and\r\n  desirous that the author should derive the full advantage of his\r\n  labours, had it signified that the claims for recompense, on the\r\n  records of successive governments, should not be deferred. It will not\r\n  be inferred the author is surprised at what he remarks. While he\r\n  claims priority for himself, he is the last person to wish to see a\r\n  halt in science—\r\n\r\n                   “For emulation has a thousand sons.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.7:\r\n\r\n  My esteemed friend, Graeme Mercer, Esq. (of Maevisbank), who\r\n  stimulated my exertions with his approbation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.8:\r\n\r\n  Many incidents in these journeys would require no aid of imagination\r\n  to touch on the romantic, but they can have no place here.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.9:\r\n\r\n  Eastern tableland.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.10:\r\n\r\n  Sind River.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.11:\r\n\r\n  Parbati River.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.12:\r\n\r\n  Kali Sind River.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.13:\r\n\r\n  Passage of the Chambal and junction of the Par.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.14:\r\n\r\n  The Shaikh brought me specimens of the rock, which is siliceous; and\r\n  also a piece of brick of the very ancient fortress of Sehwan, and some\r\n  of the grain from its pits, charred and alleged by tradition to have\r\n  lain there since the period of Raja Bhartarihari, the brother of\r\n  Vikramaditya. It is not impossible that it might be owing to\r\n  Alexander’s terrific progress, and to their supplies being destroyed\r\n  by fire. Sehwan is conjectured by Captain Pottinger to be the capital\r\n  of Musicanus. [The capital of the Sogdoi has been identified with Alor\r\n  or Aror; but Cunningham places it between Alor and Uchh. The capital\r\n  of Mousikanos was possibly Alor, and Sehwān the Sindimana of the\r\n  Greeks. But, owing to changes in the course of the Lower Indus, it is\r\n  very difficult to identify ancient sites (McCrindle, _Alexander_, 157,\r\n  354 f.).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.15:\r\n\r\n  His health was worn out at length, and he became the victim of\r\n  depressed spirits.

It proved the most fruitful of\r\n  all my many journeys. [The results are recorded in _Travels in Western\r\n  India_, published in 1839, after the author’s death.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.21:\r\n\r\n  Guru Sikhar.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.22:\r\n\r\n  Its classic name is _Vetravati_, _Vetra_ being the common willow [or\r\n  reed] in Sanskrit; said by Wilford to be the same in Welsh.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.23:\r\n\r\n  Literally ‘the central (_madhya_) flat.’ [It means ‘Land of the Med\r\n  tribe.’]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.24:\r\n\r\n  Meaning ‘table (_pat_) mountain (_ar_).’—Although _ar_ may not be\r\n  found in any Sanskrit dictionary with the signification ‘mountain,’\r\n  yet it appears to be a primitive root possessing such\r\n  meaning—instance, Ar-buddha, ‘hill of Buddha’; Aravalli, ‘hill of\r\n  strength.’ _Ar_ is Hebrew for ‘mountain’ (qu. Ararat?) Ὅρος in Greek?\r\n  The common word for a mountain in Sanskrit, _gir_, is equally so in\r\n  Hebrew. [These derivations are out of date. The origin of the word\r\n  _patār_ is obscure. Sir G. Grierson, to whom the question was\r\n  referred, suggests a connexion with Marāthi _pathār_, ‘a tableland,’\r\n  or Gujarati _pathār_ (Skr. _prastara_, ‘expanse, extent’). The word is\r\n  probably not connected with Hindi _pāt_, ‘a board.’]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.25:\r\n\r\n  The Betwa River runs under the tableland just alluded to, on the east.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.26:\r\n\r\n  I am familiar with these regions, and confidently predict that when a\r\n  similar measurement shall be made from the Betwa to Kotah, these\r\n  results will little err, and the error will be in having made Kotah\r\n  somewhat too elevated, and the bed of the Betwa a little too low.\r\n  [Udaipur city is 1950 feet above sea-level.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.27:\r\n\r\n  Central India, a term which I first applied as the title of the map\r\n  presented to the Marquess of Hastings, in 1815, ‘of Central and\r\n  Western India,’ and since become familiar.

[Ārāvalli probably means ‘Corner Line.’]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.31:\r\n\r\n  It was my intention to have penetrated through their singular abodes;\r\n  and I had negotiated, and obtained of these ‘forest lords’ a promise\r\n  of hospitable passport, of which I have never allowed myself to doubt,\r\n  as the virtues of pledged faith and hospitality are ever to be found\r\n  in stronger keeping in the inverse ratio of civilization. Many years\r\n  ago one of my parties was permitted to range through this tract. In\r\n  one of the passes of their lengthened valleys ‘The Lord of the\r\n  Mountain’ was dead: the men were all abroad, and his widow alone in\r\n  the hut. Madari told his story, and claimed her surety and passport;\r\n  which the Bhilni delivered from the quiver of her late lord; and the\r\n  arrow carried in his hand was as well recognised as the cumbrous roll\r\n  with all its seals and appendages of a traveller in Europe.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.32:\r\n\r\n  _Meru_ signifies ‘a hill’ in Sanskrit, hence Komal, or properly\r\n  Kūmbhalmer, is ‘the hill’ or ‘mountain of Kūmbha,’ a prince whose\r\n  exploits are narrated. Likewise Ajmer is the ‘hill of Ajaya,’ the\r\n  ‘Invincible’ hill. _Mer_ is with the long é, like _Mère_ in French, in\r\n  classical orthography. [Ajmer, ‘hill of Aja, Chauhān.’]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.33:\r\n\r\n  At the point of my descent this was characteristically illustrated by\r\n  my Rajput friend of Semar, whose domain had been invaded and cow-pens\r\n  emptied, but a few days before, by the mountain bandit of Sirohi. With\r\n  their booty they took the shortest and not most practicable road: but\r\n  though their alpine kine are pretty well accustomed to leaping in such\r\n  abodes, it would appear they had hesitated here. The difficulty was\r\n  soon got over by one of the Minas, who with his dagger transfixed one\r\n  and rolled him over the height, his carcase serving at once as a\r\n  precedent and a _stepping-stone_ for his horned kindred.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.34:\r\n\r\n  [“Oldest of all the physical features which intersect the continent is\r\n  the range of mountains known as the Arāvallis, which strikes across\r\n  the Peninsula from north-east to south-west, overlooking the sandy\r\n  wastes of Rājputāna. The Arāvallis are but the depressed and degraded\r\n  relics of a far more prominent mountain system, which stood, in\r\n  Palaeozoic times, on the edge of the Rājputāna Sea. The disintegrated\r\n  rocks which once formed part of the Arāvallis are now spread out in\r\n  wide red-stone plains to the east” (_IGI_, i. 1).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.35:\r\n\r\n  Near this the Chambal first breaks into the Patar.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.36:\r\n\r\n  Here is the celebrated pass through the mountains.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.37:\r\n\r\n  Here the Niwaz breaks the chain.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.38:\r\n\r\n  Both celebrated passes, where the ranges are very complicated.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.39:\r\n\r\n  I have rescued a few of these from oblivion to present to my\r\n  countrymen.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.40:\r\n\r\n  Hence its name, _Vindhya_, ‘the barrier,’ to the further progress of\r\n  the sun in his northern declination.

He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither\r\n  regardeth he the crying of the driver” (Job xxxix. 6, 7).\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.53:\r\n\r\n  Purwa.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.54:\r\n\r\n  I have beheld it from the top of the ruined fortress of Hissar with\r\n  unlimited range of vision, no object to diverge its ray, save the\r\n  miniature forests; the entire circle of the horizon a chain of more\r\n  than fancy could form of palaces, towers, and these airy ‘pillars of\r\n  heaven’ terminating in turn their ephemeral existence. But in the\r\n  deserts of Dhat and Umrasumra, where the shepherds pasture their\r\n  flocks, and especially where the alkaline plant is produced, the\r\n  stratification is more horizontal, and produces more of the watery\r\n  deception. It is this illusion to which the inspired writer refers,\r\n  when he says, “the mock pool of the desert shall become real water”\r\n  [Isaiah xxv. 7]. The inhabitants of the desert term it _Chitram_,\r\n  literally ‘the picture,’ by no means an unhappy designation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.55:\r\n\r\n  _Sehraie_ [in the text], from _sahra_, ‘desert.’ Hence Sarrazin, or\r\n  Saracen, is a corruption from _sahra_, ‘desert,’ and _zadan_, ‘to\r\n  strike,’ contracted. _Rāhzani_, ‘to strike on the road’ (_rāh_).\r\n  _Rāhbar_, ‘on the road,’ corrupted by the Pindaris to _labar_, the\r\n  designation of their forays. [The true name is Sahariya, which has\r\n  been connected with that of the Savara, a tribe in Eastern India.\r\n  Saracen comes to us from the late Latin _Saraceni_, of which the\r\n  origin is unknown; it cannot be derived from the Arabic _Sharqi_,\r\n  ‘eastern’ (see _New English Dictionary_, _s.v._).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1.56:\r\n\r\n  The confluent arms or sources of the Indus.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK II\r\n                      HISTORY OF THE RĀJPUT TRIBES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 1\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Purānas.=—Being desirous of epitomizing the chronicles of the\r\nmartial races of Central and Western India, it was essential to\r\nascertain the sources whence they draw, or claim to draw, their lineage.\r\nFor this purpose I obtained from the library of the Rana of Udaipur\r\ntheir sacred volumes, the Puranas, and laid them before a body of\r\npandits, over whom presided the learned Jati Gyanchandra. From these\r\nextracts were made of all the genealogies of the great races of Surya\r\nand Chandra, and of facts historical and geographical.\r\n\r\nMost of the Puranas[2.1.1] contain portions of historical as well as\r\ngeographical knowledge; but the Bhagavat, the Skanda, the Agni, and the\r\nBhavishya are the chief guides. It is rather fortunate than to be\r\nregretted that their chronologies do not perfectly agree. The number of\r\nprinces in each line varies, and names are transposed; but we recognize\r\ndistinctly the principal features in each, affording the conclusion that\r\nthey are the productions of various writers, borrowing from some common\r\noriginal source [21].\r\n\r\n=Deluge Legend.=—The Genesis[2.1.2] of India commences with an event\r\ndescribed in the history of almost all nations, the deluge, which,\r\nthough treated with the fancy peculiar to the orientals, is not the less\r\nentitled to attention. The essence of the extract from the Agni Purana\r\nis this: “When ocean quitted his bounds and caused universal destruction\r\nby Brahma’s command, Vaivaswata[2.1.3] Manu (Noah), who dwelt near the\r\nHimalaya[2.1.4] mountains was giving water to the gods in the Kritamala\r\nriver, when a small fish fell into his hand. A voice commanded him to\r\npreserve it. The fish expanded to an enormous size. Manu, with his sons\r\nand their wives, and the sages, with the seed of every living thing,\r\nentered into a vessel which was fastened to a horn on the head of the\r\nfish, and thus they were preserved.”\r\n\r\nHere, then, the grand northern chain is given to which the abode of the\r\ngreat patriarch of mankind approximated. In the Bhavishya it is stated,\r\nthat “Vaivaswata (sun-born) Manu ruled at the mountain Sumeru. Of his\r\nseed was Kakutstha Raja, who obtained sovereignty at Ayodhya,[2.1.5] and\r\nhis descendants filled the land and spread over the earth.”\r\n\r\nI am aware of the meaning given to Sumeru, that thus the Hindus\r\ndesignated the north pole of the earth. But they had also a mountain\r\nwith this same appellation of pre-eminence of Meru, ‘the hill,’ with the\r\nprefix Su, ‘good, sacred’: the Sacred Hill.\r\n\r\n=Meru, Sumeru.=—In the geography of the Agni Purana, the term is used as\r\na substantial geographical limit;[2.1.6] and some of the rivers flowing\r\nfrom the mountainous ranges, whose relative position with Sumeru are\r\nthere defined, still retain their ancient appellations. Let us not\r\ndarken the subject, by supposing only allegorical meanings attached to\r\nexplicit points. In the distribution of their seven dwipas, or\r\ncontinents, though they interpose seas of curds, milk, or wine, we\r\nshould not reject strong and evident facts, because subsequent ignorant\r\ninterpolators filled up the page with puerilities [22].\r\n\r\nThis sacred mountain (Sumeru) is claimed by the Brahmans as the abode of\r\nMahadeva,[2.1.7] Adiswar,[2.1.8] or Baghes[2.1.9]; by the Jains, as the\r\nabode of Adinath,[2.1.10] the first Jiniswara, or Jain lord. Here they\r\nsay he taught mankind the arts of agriculture and civilized life. The\r\nGreeks claimed it as the abode of Bacchus; and hence the Grecian fable\r\nof this god being taken from the thigh of Jupiter, confounding _meros_\r\n(thigh) with the _meru_ (hill) of this Indian deity. In this vicinity\r\nthe followers of Alexander had their Saturnalia, drank to excess of the\r\nwine from its indigenous vines, and bound their brows with ivy\r\n(_vela_)[2.1.11] sacred to the Baghes of the east and west, whose\r\nvotaries alike indulge in ‘strong drink.’\r\n\r\nThese traditions appear to point to one spot, and to one individual, in\r\nthe early history of mankind, when the Hindu and the Greek approach a\r\ncommon focus; for there is little doubt that Adinath, Adiswara, Osiris,\r\nBaghes, Bacchus, Manu, Menes designate the patriarch of mankind, Noah.\r\n\r\nThe Hindus can at this time give only a very general idea of the site of\r\nMeru; but they appear to localize it in a space of which Bamian, Kabul,\r\nand Ghazni would be the exterior points. The former of these cities is\r\nknown to possess remains of the religion of Buddha, in its caves and\r\ncolossal statues.[2.1.12] The Paropamisan Alexandria is near Bamian; but\r\nthe Meru and Nyssa[2.1.13] of Alexander are placed more to the eastward\r\nby the Greek writers, and according to the cautious Arrian between the\r\nCophas and Indus. Authority localizes it between Peshawar and Jalalabad,\r\nand calls it Merkoh, or Markoh,[2.1.14] \"a bare rock 2000 feet high [23]\r\nwith caves to the westward, termed Bedaulat by the Emperor Humayun from\r\nits dismal appearance.\"[2.1.15] This designation, however, of Dasht-i\r\nBedaulat, or ‘unhappy plain,’ was given to the tract between the cities\r\nbeforementioned [24].\r\n\r\nThe only scope of these remarks on Sumeru is to show that the Hindus\r\nthemselves do not make India within the Indus the cradle of their race,\r\nbut west, amidst the hills of Caucasus,[2.1.16] whence the sons of\r\nVaivaswata, or the ‘sun-born,’ migrated eastward to the Indus and\r\nGanges, and founded their first establishment in Kosala, the capital,\r\nAyodhya, or Oudh.\r\n\r\nMost nations have indulged the desire of fixing the source whence they\r\nissued, and few spots possess more interest than this elevated\r\nMadhya-Bhumi, or ‘central region’ of Asia, where the Amu, Oxus, or\r\nJihun, and other rivers, have their rise, and in which both the Surya\r\nand Indu[2.1.17] races (_Sakha_) claim the hill,[2.1.18] sacred to a\r\ngreat patriarchal ancestor, whence they migrated eastward.\r\n\r\nThe Rajput tribes could scarcely have acquired some of their still\r\nexisting Scythic habits and warlike superstitions on the burning plains\r\nof Ind. It was too hot to hail with fervent adoration the return of the\r\nsun from his southern course to enliven the northern hemisphere. This\r\nshould be the religion of a colder clime, brought from their first\r\nhaunts, the sources of the Jihun and Jaxartes. The grand solstitial\r\nfestival, the Aswamedha, or sacrifice of the horse (the type of the\r\nsun), practised by the children of Vaivaswata, the ‘sun-born,’ was most\r\nprobably simultaneously introduced from Scythia into the plains of Ind,\r\nand west, by the sons of Odin, Woden, or Budha, into Scandinavia, where\r\nit became the Hi-el or Hi-ul,[2.1.19] the festival of the winter\r\nsolstice; the grand jubilee of northern nations, and in the first ages\r\nof Christianity, being so near the epoch of its rise, gladly used by the\r\nfirst fathers of the church to perpetuate that event[2.1.20][25].\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.1.1:\r\n\r\n  “Every Purana,” says the first authority existing in Sanskrit lore,\r\n  “treats of five subjects: the creation of the universe; its progress,\r\n  and the renovation of the world; the genealogy of gods and heroes;\r\n  chronology, according to a fabulous system; and heroic history,\r\n  containing the achievements of demi-gods and heroes. Since each purana\r\n  contains a cosmogony, both mythological and heroic history, the works\r\n  which bear that title may not unaptly be compared to the Grecian\r\n  theogonies” (‘Essay on the Sanskrit and Pracrit Languages,’ by H.

Wilford appears to have\r\n  borrowed largely from that ancient store-house (as the Hindu would\r\n  call it) of learning, Sir Walter Raleigh’s _History of the World_. He\r\n  combines, however, much of what that great man had so singularly\r\n  acquired and condensed, with what he himself collected, and with the\r\n  aid of imagination has formed a curious mosaic. But when he took a\r\n  peep into “the chorographical description of the Terrestrial\r\n  Paradise,” I am surprised he did not separate the nurseries of mankind\r\n  before and after the flood. There is one passage, also, of Sir Walter\r\n  Raleigh which would have aided his hypothesis, that Eden was in Higher\r\n  Asia, between the common sources of the Jihun and other grand rivers:\r\n  the abundance of the _Ficus Indica_, or bar-tree, sacred to the first\r\n  lord, Adnath or Mahadeva.\r\n\r\n  “Now for the tree of knowledge of good and evil, some men have\r\n  presumed further; especially Gorapius Bocanus, who giveth himself the\r\n  honour to have found out the kind of this tree, which none of the\r\n  writers of former times could ever guess at, whereat Gorapius much\r\n  marvelleth.”\r\n\r\n                      ——“Both together went\r\n          Into the thickest wood; there soon they chose\r\n          The fig tree; not that kind for fruit renowned,\r\n          But such as at this day, to Indians known\r\n          In Malabar or Decan, spreads her arms\r\n          Branching so broad and long, that in the ground\r\n          The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow\r\n          About the mother tree, a pillar’d shade\r\n          High overarched, and echoing walks between.\r\n          There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat,\r\n          Shelters in cool and tends his pasturing herds.”\r\n                            ——“Those leaves\r\n          They gathered, broad as Amazonian targe.”\r\n                             _Paradise Lost_, Book ix. 1100 ff.\r\n\r\n  Sir Walter strongly supports the Hindu hypothesis regarding the\r\n  locality of the nursery for rearing mankind, and that “India was the\r\n  first planted and peopled countrie after the flood” (p. 99). His first\r\n  argument is, that it was a place where the vine and olive were\r\n  indigenous, as amongst the Sakai Scythai (and as they still are,\r\n  together with oats, between Kabul and Bamian); and that Ararat could\r\n  not be in Armenia, because the Gordian mountains on which the ark\r\n  rested were in longitude 75°, and the Valley of Shinar 79° to 80°,\r\n  which would be reversing the tide of migration. “As they journeyed\r\n  _from the East_, they found a plain, in the land of Shinar, and they\r\n  dwelt there” (Genesis, chap. xi. ver. 2). He adds, “Ararat, named by\r\n  Moses, is not any one hill, but a general term for the great Caucasian\r\n  range; therefore we must blow up this mountain Ararat, or dig it down\r\n  and carry it out of Armenia, or find it elsewhere in a warmer country,\r\n  and east from Shinar.” He therefore places it in Indo-Scythia, in 140°\r\n  of longitude and 35° to 37° of latitude, “where the mountains do build\r\n  themselves exceeding high”: and concludes, \"It was in the plentiful\r\n  warm East where Noah rested, where he planted the vine, where he\r\n  tilled the ground and lived thereon. Placuit vero Noacho agriculturæ\r\n  studium in qua tractanda ipse omnium peritissimus esse dicitur; ob\r\n  eamque rem, sua ipsius lingua, _Ish-Adamath_:[2.1.15.A] hoc est,\r\n  _Telluris Vir_, appellatur, celebratusque est. The study of husbandry\r\n  pleased Noah (says the excellent learned man, Arius Montanus) in the\r\n  order and knowledge of which it is said that Noah excelled all men,\r\n  and therefore was he called in his own language, _a man exercised in\r\n  the earth_.\" The title, character, and abode exactly suit the\r\n  description the Jains give of their first Jiniswara, Adinath, the\r\n  first lordly man, who taught them agriculture, even to “muzzling the\r\n  bull in treading out the corn.”\r\n\r\n  Had Sir Walter been aware that the Hindu sacred books styled their\r\n  country Aryavarta,[2.1.15.B] and of which the great Imaus is the\r\n  northern boundary, he would doubtless have seized it for his Ararat.\r\n  [Needless to say, these speculations are obsolete.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.1.15.A:\r\n\r\n  In Sanskrit, _Īsh_, ‘Lord,’ _ādi_, ‘the first,’ _matti_, ‘Earth.’ [The\r\n  derivation is absurd: _matti_, ‘clay,’ is modern Hindi.] Here the\r\n  Sanskrit and Hebrew have the same meaning, ‘first lord of the earth.’\r\n  In these remote Rajput regions, where early manners and language\r\n  remain, the strongest phrase to denote a man or human being is\r\n  literally ‘earth.’ A chief describing a fray between his own followers\r\n  and borderers whence death ensued, says, _Meri matti māri_, ‘My earth\r\n  has been struck’: a phrase requiring no comment, and denoting that he\r\n  must have blood in return.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.1.15.B:\r\n\r\n  _Āryāvarta_, or the land of promise or virtue, cannot extend to the\r\n  flat plains of India south of the Himavat; for this is styled in the\r\n  _Purānas_ the very reverse, _kukarma des_, or land of vice. [Āryāvarta\r\n  is the land bounded by the Himalaya and Vindhya, from the eastern to\r\n  the western seas (Manu, _Laws_, ii. 22).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.1.16:\r\n\r\n  Hindu, or Indu-kush or koh, is the local appellation; ‘mountain of the\r\n  moon.’ [Hindu-kush is said to mean ‘Hindu-slayer’ or ‘Indian\r\n  Caucasus.’]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.1.17:\r\n\r\n  Solar and lunar.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.1.18:\r\n\r\n  Meru, ‘the hill,’ is used distinctively, as in Jaisalmer (the capital\r\n  of the Bhatti tribe in the Western Desert), ‘the hill of Jaisal’;\r\n  Merwara, or the ‘mountainous region’; and its inhabitants Meras, or\r\n  ‘mountaineers.’ Thus, also, in the grand epic the Ramayana (Book i. p.\r\n  236), Mena is the mountain-nymph, the daughter of Meru and spouse of\r\n  Himavat; from whom sprung two daughters, the river goddess Ganga and\r\n  the mountain-nymph Parbati. She is, in the Mahabharata, also termed\r\n  Saila, the daughter of Sail, another designation of the snowy chain;\r\n  and hence mountain streams are called in Sanskrit _silletee_ [?].\r\n  Saila bears the same attributes with the Phrygian Cybele, who was also\r\n  the daughter of a mountain of the same name; the one is carried, the\r\n  other drawn, by lions. Thus the Greeks also metamorphosed _Parbat\r\n  Pamer_, or ‘the mountain Pamer,’ into Paropamisan, applied to the\r\n  Hindu Koh west of Bamian: but the _Parbat pat Pamer_, or ‘Pamer chief\r\n  of hills,’ is mentioned by the bard Chand as being far east of that\r\n  tract, and under it resided Hamīra, one of the great feudatories of\r\n  Prithwiraja of Delhi. Had it been Paropanisan (as some authorities\r\n  write it), it would better accord with the locality where it takes up\r\n  the name, being near to Nyssa and Meru, of which Parbat or Pahar would\r\n  be a version, and form Paronisan, ‘the Mountain of Nyssa,’ the range\r\n  Nishadha of the Puranas. [The true form is Paropanisos: the suggested\r\n  derivation is impossible.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.1.19:\r\n\r\n  _Haya_ or _Hi_, in Sanskrit, ‘horse’—_El_, ‘sun’: whence ἵππος and\r\n  ἕλιος. Ηλ appears to have been a term of Scythian origin for the sun;\r\n  and Hari, the Indian Apollo, is addressed as the sun. Hiul, or Jul, of\r\n  northern nations (qu. _Noel_ of France?), is the Hindu Sankrānti, of\r\n  which more will be said hereafter. [The feast was known as Hvil, Jul,\r\n  or Yule, and the suggested derivation is impossible.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.1.20:\r\n\r\n  Mallet’s _Northern Antiquities_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 2\r\n\r\n\r\n=Puranic Genealogies.=—The chronicles of the Bhagavat and Agni,\r\ncontaining the genealogies of the Surya (_sun_) and Indu (_moon_) races,\r\nshall now be examined. The first of these, by calculation, brings down\r\nthe chain to a period six centuries subsequent to Vikramaditya (A.D.\r\n650), so that these books may have been remodelled or commented on about\r\nthis period: their fabrication cannot be supposed.\r\n\r\nAlthough portions of these genealogies by Sir William Jones, Mr.\r\nBentley, and Colonel Wilford, have appeared in the volumes of the\r\n_Asiatic Researches_, yet no one should rest satisfied with the\r\ninquiries of others, if by any process he can reach the fountain-head\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIf, after all, these are fabricated genealogies of the ancient families\r\nof India, the fabrication is of ancient date, and they are all they know\r\nthemselves upon the subject. The step next in importance to obtaining a\r\nperfect acquaintance with the genuine early history of nations, is to\r\nlearn what those nations repute to be such.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the original Puranas contained much valuable historical\r\nmatter; but, at present, it is difficult to separate a little pure metal\r\nfrom the base alloy of ignorant expounders and interpolators. I have but\r\nskimmed the surface: research, to the capable, may yet be rewarded by\r\nmany isolated facts and important transactions, now hid under the veil\r\nof ignorance and allegory.\r\n\r\n=Neglect of History by the Hindus.=—The Hindus, with the decrease of\r\nintellectual power, their possession of which is evinced by their\r\narchitectural remains, where just proportion and elegant mythological\r\ndevice are still visible, lost the relish for the beauty of truth, and\r\nadopted the monstrous in their writings as well as their edifices. But\r\nfor detection and shame, matters of history would be hideously distorted\r\neven in civilized Europe; but in the East, in the moral decrepitude of\r\nancient Asia, with no judge to condemn, no public to praise, each\r\npriestly expounder may revel in an unfettered imagination, and reckon\r\nhis admirers in proportion to the mixture of the marvellous[2.2.1] [26].\r\nPlain historical truths have long ceased to interest this artificially\r\nfed people.\r\n\r\nIf at such a comparatively modern period as the third century before\r\nChrist, the Babylonian historian Berosus composed his fictions, which\r\nassigned to that monarchy such incredible antiquity, it became capable\r\nof refutation from the many historians of repute who preceded him. But\r\non the fabulist of India we have no such check. If Vyasa himself penned\r\nthese legends as now existing, then is the stream of knowledge corrupt\r\nfrom the fountain-head. If such the source, the stream, filtering\r\nthrough ages of ignorance, has only been increased by fresh impurities.\r\nIt is difficult to conceive how the arts and sciences could advance,\r\nwhen it is held impious to doubt the truth of whatever has been handed\r\ndown, and still more to suppose that the degenerate could improve\r\nthereon. The highest ambition of the present learned priesthood,\r\ngeneration after generation, is to be able to comprehend what has thus\r\nreached them, and to form commentaries upon past wisdom; which\r\ncommentaries are commented on _ad infinitum_. Whoever dare now aspire to\r\nimprove thereon must keep the secret in his own breast. They are but the\r\nexpounders of the olden oracles; were they more they would be infidels.\r\nBut this could not always have been the case.\r\n\r\nWith the Hindus, as with other nations, the progress to the heights of\r\nscience they attained must have been gradual; unless we take from them\r\nthe merit of original invention, and set them down as borrowers of a\r\nsystem. These slavish fetters of the mind must have been forged at a\r\nlater period, and it is fair to infer that the monopoly of science and\r\nreligion was simultaneous. What must be the effect of such monopoly on\r\nthe impulses and operations of the understanding? Where such exists,\r\nknowledge could not long remain stationary; it must perforce retrograde.\r\nCould we but discover the period when religion[2.2.2] ceased to be a\r\n_profession_ [27] and became hereditary (and that such there was these\r\nvery genealogies bear evidence), we might approximate the era when\r\nscience attained its height.\r\n\r\n=The Priestly Office.=—In the early ages of these Solar and Lunar\r\ndynasties, the priestly office was not hereditary in families; it was a\r\nprofession; and the genealogies exhibit frequent instances of branches\r\nof these races terminating their martial career in the commencement of a\r\nreligious sect, or _gotra_, and of their descendants reassuming their\r\nwarlike occupations. Thus, of the ten sons of Ikshwaku,[2.2.3] three are\r\nrepresented as abandoning worldly affairs and taking to religion; and\r\none of these, Kanina, is said to be the first who made an _agnihotra_,\r\nor pyreum, and worshipped fire, while another son embraced commerce. Of\r\nthe Lunar line and the six sons of Pururavas, the name of the fourth was\r\nRaya; “from him the fifteenth generation was Harita, who with his eight\r\nbrothers took to the office of religion, and established the Kausika\r\nGotra, or tribe of Brahmans.”\r\n\r\nFrom the twenty-fourth prince in lineal descent from Yayati, by name\r\nBharadwaja, originated a celebrated sect, who still bear his name, and\r\nare the spiritual teachers of several Rajput tribes.\r\n\r\nOf the twenty-sixth prince, Manava, two sons devoted themselves to\r\nreligion, and established celebrated sects, viz. Mahavira, whose\r\ndescendants were the Pushkar Brahmans; and Sankriti, whose issue were\r\nlearned in the Vedas. From the line of Ajamidha these ministers of\r\nreligion were continually branching off.\r\n\r\nIn the very early periods, the princes of the Solar line, like the\r\nEgyptians and Romans, combined the offices of the priesthood with kingly\r\npower, and this whether Brahmanical or Buddhist.[2.2.4] Many of the\r\nroyal line, before and subsequent to Rama, passed great part of their\r\nlives as ascetics; and in ancient sculpture and drawings the head is as\r\noften adorned with the braided lock of the ascetic as with the diadem of\r\nroyalty.[2.2.5]\r\n\r\nThe greatest monarchs bestowed their daughters on these royal hermits\r\nand sages [28]. Ahalya, the daughter of the powerful Panchala,[2.2.6]\r\nbecame the wife of the ascetic Gautama. The sage Jamadagni espoused the\r\ndaughter of Sahasra[2.2.7] Arjuna, of Mahishmat,[2.2.8] king of the\r\nHaihaya tribe, a great branch of the Yadu race.\r\n\r\nAmong the Egyptians, according to Herodotus [ii. 37, 141], the priests\r\nsucceeded to sovereignty, as they and the military class alone could\r\nhold lands; and Sethos, the priest of Vulcan, caused a revolution, by\r\ndepriving the military of their estates.\r\n\r\nWe have various instances in India of the Brahmans from Jamadagni to the\r\nMahratta Peshwa, contesting for sovereignty; power[2.2.9] and homage\r\nbeing still their great aim, as in the days of Vishvamitra[2.2.10] and\r\nVasishtha, the royal sages [29] whom “Janaka sovereign of Mithila,\r\naddressed with folded hands in token of superiority.”\r\n\r\n=Relations of Rajputs with Brahmans.=—But this deference for the\r\nBrahmans is certainly, with many Rajput classes, very weak. In obedience\r\nto prejudice, they show them outward civility; but, unless when their\r\nfears or wishes interfere, they are less esteemed than the bards.\r\n\r\nThe story of the King Vishvamitra of Gadhipura[2.2.11] and the Brahman\r\nVasishtha, which fills so many sections of the first book of the\r\nRamayana,[2.2.12] exemplifies, under the veil of allegory, the contests\r\nfor power between the Brahmanical and military classes, and will serve\r\nto indicate the probable period when the castes became immutable.\r\nStripped of its allegory, the legend appears to point to a time when the\r\ndivision of the classes was yet imperfect; though we may infer, from the\r\nviolence of the struggle, that it was the last in which Brahmanhood\r\ncould be obtained by the military.\r\n\r\nVishvamitra was the son of Gadhi (of the race of Kausika), King of\r\nGadhipura, and contemporary of Ambarisha, King of Ayodhya or Oudh, the\r\nfortieth prince from Ikshwaku; consequently about two hundred years\r\nanterior to Rama. This event therefore, whence we infer that the system\r\nof castes was approaching perfection, was probably about one thousand\r\nfour hundred years before Christ.\r\n\r\n=Dates of the Genealogies.=—If proof can be given that these genealogies\r\nexisted in the days of Alexander, the fact would be interesting. The\r\nlegend in the Puranas, of the origin of the Lunar race, appears to\r\nafford this testimony.\r\n\r\nVyasa, the author of the grand epic the Mahabharata, was son of Santanu\r\n(of the race of Hari),[2.2.13] sovereign of Delhi, by Yojanagandha, a\r\nfisherman’s daughter,[2.2.14] [30] consequently illegitimate. He became\r\nthe spiritual father, or preceptor, of his nieces, the daughters of\r\nVichitravirya, the son and successor of Santanu.\r\n\r\n=The Herakles Legend.=—Vichitravirya had no male offspring. Of his three\r\ndaughters, one was named Pandaia[2.2.15]; and Vyasa, being the sole\r\nremaining male branch of the house of Santanu, took his niece, and\r\nspiritual daughter, Pandaia, to wife, and became the father of Pandu,\r\nafterwards sovereign of Indraprastha.\r\n\r\nArrian gives the story thus: \"It is further said that he\r\n[Herakles][2.2.16] had a very numerous progeny of children born to him\r\nin India ... [31] but that he had only one daughter.[2.2.17] The name of\r\nthis child was Pandaia, and the land in which she was born, and with the\r\nsovereignty of which Herakles entrusted her, was called after her name\r\nPandaia\" (_Indika_, viii.).\r\n\r\nThis is the very legend contained in the Puranas, of Vyasa (who was\r\nHari-kul-es, or chief of the race of Hari) and his spiritual daughter\r\nPandaia, from whom the grand race the Pandavas, and from whom Delhi and\r\nits dependencies were designated the Pandava sovereignty.\r\n\r\nHer issue ruled for thirty-one generations in direct descents, or from\r\n1120 to 610 before Christ; when the military minister,[2.2.18] connected\r\nby blood, was chosen by the chiefs who rebelled against the last Pandu\r\nking, represented as “neglectful of all the cares of government,” and\r\nwhose deposition and death introduced a new dynasty.\r\n\r\nTwo other dynasties succeeded in like manner by the usurpation of these\r\nmilitary ministers, until Vikramaditya, when the Pandava sovereignty and\r\nera of Yudhishthira were both overturned.\r\n\r\nIndraprastha remained without a sovereign, supreme power being removed\r\nfrom the north to the southern parts of India, till the fourth, or,\r\naccording to some authorities, the eighth century after Vikrama, when\r\nthe throne of Yudhishthira was once more occupied by the Tuar tribe of\r\nRajputs, claiming descents from the Pandus. To this ancient capital,\r\nthus refounded, the new appellation of Delhi was given; and the dynasty\r\nof the founder, Anangpal, lasted to the twelfth century, when he\r\nabdicated in favour of his grandson,[2.2.19] Prithiviraja, the last\r\nimperial Rajput sovereign of India, whose defeat and death introduced\r\nthe Muhammadans.\r\n\r\nThis line has also closed with the pageant of a prince, and a colony\r\nreturned from the extreme west is now the sole arbiter of the thrones of\r\nPandu and Timur.\r\n\r\nBritain has become heir to the monuments of Indraprastha raised by the\r\ndescendants of Budha and Ila; to the iron pillar of the Pandavas, \"whose\r\npedestal[2.2.20] [32] is fixed in hell\"; to the columns reared to\r\nvictory, inscribed with characters yet unknown; to the massive ruins of\r\nits ancient continuous cities, encompassing a space still larger than\r\nthe largest city in the world, whose mouldering domes and sites of\r\nfortresses,[2.2.21] the very names of which are lost, present a noble\r\nfield for speculation on the ephemeral nature of power and glory. What\r\nmonument would Britain bequeath to distant posterity of her succession\r\nto this dominion? Not one: except it be that of a still less perishable\r\nnature, the monument of national benefit. Much is in our power: much has\r\nbeen given, and posterity will demand the result.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.1:\r\n\r\n  The celebrated Goguet remarks on the madness of most nations\r\n  pretending to trace their origin to infinity. The Babylonians, the\r\n  Egyptians, and the Scythians, particularly, piqued themselves on their\r\n  high antiquity, and the first assimilate with the Hindus in boasting\r\n  they had observed the course of the stars 473,000 years. Each heaped\r\n  ages on ages; but the foundations of this pretended antiquity are not\r\n  supported by probability, and are even of modern invention (_Origin of\r\n  Laws_).\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.2:\r\n\r\n  It has been said that the Brahmanical religion was foreign to India;\r\n  but as to the period of importation we have but loose assertion. We\r\n  can easily give credit to various creeds and tenets of faith being\r\n  from time to time incorporated, ere the present books were composed,\r\n  and that previously the sons of royalty alone possessed the office.\r\n  Authorities of weight inform us of these grafts; for instance, Mr.\r\n  Colebrooke gives a passage in his _Indian Classes_: “A chief of the\r\n  twice-born tribe was brought by Vishnu’s eagle from Saca Dwipa; hence\r\n  Saca Dwipa Brahmins were known in Jambu Dwipa.” By Saka Dwipa, Scythia\r\n  is understood, of which more will be said hereafter. Ferishta also,\r\n  translating from ancient authorities, says, to the same effect, that\r\n  “in the reign of Mahraje, King of Canouj, a Brahmin came from Persia,\r\n  who introduced magic, idolatry, and the worship of the stars”; so that\r\n  there is no want of authority for the introduction of new tenets of\r\n  faith. [The passage, inaccurately quoted, is taken from Dow i. 16. See\r\n  Briggs’s translation, i. Introd. lxviii.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.3:\r\n\r\n  See Table I. [now obsolete, not reprinted].\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.4:\r\n\r\n  Some of the earlier of the twenty-four _Tirthakaras_, or Jain\r\n  hierarchs, trace their origin from the solar race of princes. [As\r\n  usual, Buddhism confused with Jainism.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.5:\r\n\r\n  Even now the Rana of Mewar mingles spiritual duties with those of\r\n  royalty, and when he attends the temple of the tutelary deity of his\r\n  race, he performs himself all the offices of the high priest for the\r\n  day. In this point a strong resemblance exists to many of the races of\r\n  antiquity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.6:\r\n\r\n  Prince of the country of Panjab, or five streams east of the Indus.\r\n  [Panchāla was in the Ganges-Jumna Duāb and its neighbourhood.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.7:\r\n\r\n  The legend of this monarch stealing his son-in-law’s, the hermit’s,\r\n  cow (of which the Ramayana gives another version), the incarnation of\r\n  Parasuram, son of Jamadagni, and his exploits, appear purely\r\n  allegorical, signifying the violence and oppression of royalty over\r\n  the earth (_prithivi_), personified by the sacred _gao_, or cow; and\r\n  that the Brahmans were enabled to wrest royalty from the martial\r\n  tribe, shows how they had multiplied. On the derivatives from the word\r\n  _gao_, I venture an etymology for others to pursue:\r\n\r\n  ΓΑῙΑ, γέα, γῆ (_Dor._ γᾶ), that which produces all things (from γάω,\r\n  _genero_); the earth.—_Jones’s Dictionary._\r\n\r\n  ΓΆΛΑ, Milk. _Gaola_, Herdsman, in Sanskrit. Γαλατικοῖ, Κέλτοι,\r\n  Galatians, or Gauls, and Celts (allowed to be the same) would be the\r\n  shepherd races, the pastoral invaders of Europe [?].\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.8:\r\n\r\n  Maheswar, on the Nerbudda River.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.9:\r\n\r\n  Hindustan abounds with Brahmans, who make excellent soldiers, as far\r\n  as bravery is a virtue; but our officers are cautious, from\r\n  experience, of admitting too many into a troop or company, for they\r\n  still retain their intriguing habits. I have seen nearly as many of\r\n  the Brahmans as of military in some companies; a dangerous error\r\n  [realized in the Great Mutiny].\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.10:\r\n\r\n  The Brahman Vasishtha possessed a cow named Savala, so fruitful that\r\n  with her assistance he could accomplish whatever he desired. By her\r\n  aid he entertained King Vishvamitra and his army. It is evident that\r\n  this cow denotes some tract of country which the priest held (bearing\r\n  in mind that _gao_, _prithivi_, signify ‘the earth,’ as well as\r\n  ‘cow’): a grant, beyond doubt, by some of Vishvamitra’s unwise\r\n  ancestors, and which he wished to resume. From her were supplied \"the\r\n  oblations to the gods and the _pitrideva_ (father-gods, or ancestors),\r\n  the perpetual sacrificial fire, the burnt-offerings and sacrifices.\"\r\n  This was “the fountain of devotional acts”; this was the Savala for\r\n  which the king offered “a hundred thousand cows”; this was \"the jewel\r\n  of which a king only should be proprietor.\"—The subjects of the\r\n  Brahman appeared not to relish such transfer, and by “the lowing of\r\n  the cow Savala” obtained numerous foreign auxiliaries, which enabled\r\n  the Brahman to set his sovereign at defiance. Of these “the Pahlavi\r\n  (Persian) kings, the dreadful Sakas (Sakai), and Yavanas (Greeks),\r\n  with scymitars and gold armour, the Kambojas,” etc., were each in turn\r\n  created by the all-producing cow. The armies of the Pahlavi kings were\r\n  cut to pieces by Vishvamitra; who at last, by continual\r\n  reinforcements, was overpowered by the Brahman’s levies. These\r\n  reinforcements would appear to have been the ancient Persians, the\r\n  Sacae, the Greeks, the inhabitants of Assam and Southern India, and\r\n  various races out of the pale of the Hindu religion; all classed under\r\n  the term _Mlechchha_, equivalents the ‘barbarian’ of the Greeks and\r\n  Romans.\r\n\r\n  The King Vishvamitra, defeated and disgraced by this powerful priest,\r\n  “like a serpent with his teeth broken, like the sun robbed by the\r\n  eclipse of its splendour, was filled with perturbation. Deprived of\r\n  his sons and array, stripped of his pride and confidence, he was left\r\n  without resource as a bird bereft of his wings.” He abandoned his\r\n  kingdom to his son, and like all Hindu princes in distress,\r\n  determined, by penitential rites and austerities, “to obtain\r\n  Brahmanhood.” He took up his abode at the sacred Pushkar, living on\r\n  fruits and roots, and fixing his mind, said, “I will become a\r\n  Brahman.” By these penances he attained such spiritual power that he\r\n  was enabled to usurp the Brahman’s office. The theocrats caution\r\n  Vishvamitra, thus determined to become a Brahman by austerity, that\r\n  “the divine books are to be observed with care only by those\r\n  acquainted with their evidence; nor does it become thee (Vishvamitra)\r\n  to subvert the order of things established by the ancients.” The\r\n  history of his wanderings, austerities, and the temptations thrown in\r\n  his way is related. The celestial fair were commissioned to break in\r\n  upon his meditations. The mother of love herself descended; while\r\n  Indra, joining the cause of the Brahmans, took the shape of the\r\n  kokila, and added the melody of his notes to the allurements of\r\n  Rambha, and the perfumed zephyrs which assailed the royal saint in the\r\n  wilderness. He was proof against all temptation, and condemned the\r\n  fair to become a pillar of stone. He persevered “till every passion\r\n  was subdued,” till “not a tincture of sin appeared in him,” and gave\r\n  such alarm to the whole priesthood, that they dreaded lest his\r\n  excessive sanctity should be fatal to them: they feared “mankind would\r\n  become atheists.” “The gods and Brahma at their head were obliged to\r\n  grant his desire of Brahmanhood; and Vashishtha, conciliated by the\r\n  gods, acquiesced in their wish, and formed a friendship with\r\n  Vishvamitra” [Muir, _Original Sanskrit Texts_, Part i. (1858), 75\r\n  ff.].\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.11:\r\n\r\n  Kanauj, the ancient capital of the present race of Marwar. [This is a\r\n  myth.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.12:\r\n\r\n  See translation of this epic, by Messrs. Carey and Marshman [in verse,\r\n  by R. T. H. Griffith].\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.13:\r\n\r\n  Hari-Kula.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.14:\r\n\r\n  It is a very curious circumstance that Hindu legend gives to two of\r\n  their most celebrated authors, whom they have invested with a sacred\r\n  character, a descent from the aboriginal and impure tribes of India:\r\n  Vyasa from a fisherman, and Valmiki, the author of the other grand\r\n  epic the Ramayana, from a Baddhik or robber, an associate of the Bhil\r\n  tribe at Abu. The conversion of Valmiki (said to have been miraculous,\r\n  when in the act of robbing the shrine of the deity) is worked into a\r\n  story of considerable effect, in the works of Chand, from olden\r\n  authority.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.15:\r\n\r\n  The reason for this name is thus given. One of these daughters being\r\n  by a slave, it was necessary to ascertain which: a difficult matter,\r\n  from the seclusion in which they were kept. It was therefore left to\r\n  Vyasa to discover the pure of birth, who determined that nobility of\r\n  blood would show itself, and commanded that the princesses should walk\r\n  uncovered before him. The elder, from shame, closed her eyes, and from\r\n  her was born the blind Dhritarashtra, sovereign of Hastinapura; the\r\n  second, from the same feeling, covered herself with yellow ochre,\r\n  called _pandu_, and henceforth she bore the name of Pandya, and her\r\n  son was called Pandu; while the third stepped forth unabashed. She was\r\n  adjudged not of gentle blood, and her issue was Vidura.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.16:\r\n\r\n  A generic term for the sovereigns of the race of Hari, used by Arrian\r\n  as a proper name [?]. A section of the Mahabharata is devoted to the\r\n  history of the Harikula, of which race was Vyasa.\r\n\r\n  Arrian notices the similarity of the Theban and the Hindu Hercules,\r\n  and cites as authority the ambassador of Seleucus, Megasthenes, who\r\n  says: “This Herakles is held in special honour by the Sourasenoi, an\r\n  Indian tribe who possess two large cities, Methora and Cleisobora....\r\n  But the dress which this Herakles wore, Megasthenes tells us,\r\n  resembled that of the Theban Herakles, as the Indians themselves\r\n  admit.” [Arrian, _Indika_, viii., Methora is Mathura; Growse\r\n  (_Mathura_, 3rd ed. 279) suggests that Cleisobora is Krishnapura,\r\n  ‘city of Krishna.’]\r\n\r\n  Diodorus has the same legend, with some variety. He says: \"Hercules\r\n  was born amongst the Indians, and like the Greeks they furnish him\r\n  with a club and lion’s hide. In strength (_bala_) he excelled all men,\r\n  and cleared the sea and land of monsters and wild beasts. He had many\r\n  sons, but only one daughter. It is said that he built Palibothra, and\r\n  divided his kingdom amongst his sons (the Balika-putras, sons of\r\n  Bali). They never colonized; but in time most of the cities assumed a\r\n  democratical form of government (though some were monarchical) till\r\n  Alexander’s time.\" The combats of Hercules, to which Diodorus alludes,\r\n  are those in the legendary haunts of the Harikulas, during their\r\n  twelve years’ exile from the seats of their forefathers.\r\n\r\n  How invaluable such remnants of the ancient race of Harikula! How\r\n  refreshing to the mind yet to discover, amidst the ruins on the\r\n  Yamuna, Hercules (Baldeva, god of strength) retaining his club and\r\n  lion’s hide, standing on his pedestal at Baldeo, and yet worshipped by\r\n  the Suraseni! This name was given to a large tract of country round\r\n  Mathura, or rather round Surpura, the ancient capital founded by\r\n  Surasena, the grandfather of the Indian brother-deities, Krishna and\r\n  Baldeva, Apollo and Hercules. The title would apply to either; though\r\n  Baldeva has the attributes of the ‘god of strength.’ Both are _es_\r\n  (lords) of the race (_kula_) of Hari (Hari-kul-es), of which the\r\n  Greeks might have made the compound Hercules. Might not a colony after\r\n  the Great War have migrated westward? The period of the return of the\r\n  Heraclidae, the descendants of Atreus (Atri is progenitor of the\r\n  Harikula), would answer: it was about half a century after the Great\r\n  War. [These speculations are worthless.]\r\n\r\n  It is unfortunate that Alexander’s historians were unable to penetrate\r\n  into the arcana of the Hindus, as Herodotus appears to have done with\r\n  those of the Egyptians. The shortness of Alexander’s stay, the unknown\r\n  language in which their science and religion were hid, presented an\r\n  insuperable difficulty. They could have made very little progress in\r\n  the study of the language without discovering its analogy to their\r\n  own.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.17:\r\n\r\n  Arrian generally exercises his judgment in these matters, and is the\r\n  reverse of credulous. On this point he says, “Now to me it seems that\r\n  even if Herakles could have done a thing so marvellous, he could have\r\n  made himself longer-lived, in order to have intercourse with his\r\n  daughter when she was of mature age” [_Indika_, ix.].\r\n\r\n  Sandrocottus is mentioned by Arrian to be of this line; and we can\r\n  have no hesitation, therefore, in giving him a place in the dynasty of\r\n  Puru, the second son of Yayati, whence the patronymic used by the race\r\n  now extinct, as was Yadu, the elder brother of Puru. Hence\r\n  Sandrocottus, if not a Puru himself, is connected with the chain of\r\n  which the links are Jarasandha (a hero of the Bharat), Ripunjaya, the\r\n  twenty-third in descent, when a new race, headed by Sanaka and\r\n  Sheshnag, about six hundred years before Christ, usurped the seat of\r\n  the lineal descendants of Puru; in which line of usurpation is\r\n  Chandragupta, of the tribe Maurya, the Sandrocottus of Alexander, a\r\n  branch of this Sheshnag, Takshak, or Snake race, a race which,\r\n  stripped of its allegory, will afford room for subsequent\r\n  dissertation. The Prasioi of Arrian would be the stock of Puru; Prayag\r\n  is claimed in the annals yet existing as the cradle of their race.\r\n  This is the modern Allahabad; and the Eranaboas must be the Jumna, and\r\n  the point of junction with the Ganges, where we must place the capital\r\n  of the Prasioi. [For Sandrokottos or Chandragupta Maurya see Smith,\r\n  _EHI_, 42 ff. He certainly did not belong to the ‘Snake Race.’ The\r\n  Erannoboas (Skr. Hiranyavaha, ‘gold-bearing’) is the river Son. The\r\n  Prasioi (Skr. Prāchyās, ‘dwellers in the east’) had their capital at\r\n  Pātaliputra, the modern Patna (McCrindle, _Alexander_, 365 f.).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.18:\r\n\r\n  Analogous to the _maire du palais_ of the first races of the Franks.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.19:\r\n\r\n  His daughter’s son. This is not the first or only instance of the\r\n  Salic law of India being set aside. There are two in the history of\r\n  the sovereigns of Anhilwara Patan. In all adoptions of this nature,\r\n  when the child ‘binds round his head the turban’ of his adopted\r\n  father, he is finally severed from the stock whence he had his birth.\r\n  [For the early history of Delhi see Smith, _EHI_, 386 ff.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.20:\r\n\r\n  The khil, or iron pillar of the Pandus, is mentioned in the poems of\r\n  Chand. An infidel Tuar prince wished to prove the truth of the\r\n  tradition of its depth of foundation: \"blood gushed up from the\r\n  earth’s centre, the pillar became loose (_dhili_),\" as did the fortune\r\n  of the house from such impiety. This is the origin of _Delhi_. [The\r\n  inscription on the pillar proves the falsity of the legend, and the\r\n  name Delhi is older than the Tuar dynasty (_IGI_, xi. 233).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.2.21:\r\n\r\n  I doubt if Shahpur is yet known. I traced its extent from the remains\r\n  of a tower between Humayun’s tomb and the grand column, the Kutb. In\r\n  1809 I resided four months at the mausoleum of Safdar Jang, the\r\n  ancestor of the present [late] King of Oudh, amidst the ruins of\r\n  Indraprastha, several miles from inhabited Delhi, but with which these\r\n  ruins forms detached links of connexion. I went to that retirement\r\n  with a friend now no more, Lieutenant Macartney, a name well known and\r\n  honoured. We had both been employed in surveying the canals which had\r\n  their sources in common from the head of the Jumna, where this river\r\n  leaves its rocky barriers, the Siwalik chain, and issues into the\r\n  plains of Hindustan. These canals on each side, fed by the parent\r\n  stream, returned the waters again into it; one through the city of\r\n  Delhi, the other on the opposite side. [Cunningham (_ASR_, i. 207 ff.)\r\n  proved that the true site of the ancient city, Siri, was the old\r\n  ruined fort to the north-east of Rāī Pithora’s stronghold, which is at\r\n  present called Shāhpur. This identification has been disputed by C. J.\r\n  Campbell (_JASB_, 1866, p. 206). But Cunningham gives good reasons for\r\n  maintaining his opinion. The place took its name from Sher Shāh and\r\n  his son Islām or Salīm Shāh. See also Carr Stephens, _Archaeological\r\n  and Monumental Remains of Delhi_ (1876), pp. 87 f., 190.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 3\r\n\r\n\r\n=Princes of the Solar Line.=—Vyasa gives but fifty-seven princes of the\r\nSolar line, from Vaivaswata Manu to Rama; and no list which has come\r\nunder my observation exhibits more than fifty-eight, for the same\r\nperiod, of the Lunar race. How different from the Egyptian priesthood,\r\nwho, according to Herodotus, gave a list up to that period of three\r\nhundred and thirty[2.3.1] sovereigns from their first prince, also the\r\n‘sun-born[2.3.2] Menes!’\r\n\r\nIkshwaku was the son of Manu, and the first who moved to the eastward,\r\nand founded Ayodhya.\r\n\r\nBudha (Mercury) founded the Lunar line; but we are not told who\r\nestablished their first capital, Prayag,[2.3.3] though we are authorized\r\nto infer that it was founded by Puru, the sixth in descent from Budha\r\n[33].\r\n\r\nA succession of fifty-seven princes occupied Ayodhya from Ikshwaku to\r\nRama. From Yäyati’s sons the Lunar races descend in unequal lengths. The\r\nlines from Yadu,[2.3.4] concluding with Krishna and his cousin Kansa,\r\nexhibit fifty-seven and fifty-nine descents from Yayati; while\r\nYudhishthira,[2.3.5] Salya,[2.3.6] Jarasandha,[2.3.7] and\r\nVahurita,[2.3.8] all contemporaries of Krishna and Kansa, are fifty-one,\r\nforty-six, and forty-seven generations respectively, from the common\r\nancestor Yayati.\r\n\r\n=Solar and Lunar Genealogies.=—There is a wide difference between the\r\nSolar and the Yadu branches of the Lunar lines; yet is that now given\r\nfuller than any I have met with. Sir William Jones’s lists of the Solar\r\nline give fifty-six, and of the Lunar (Budha to Yudhishthira) forty-six,\r\nbeing one less in each than in the tables now presented; nor has he\r\ngiven the important branch terminating with Krishna. So close an\r\naffinity between lists, derived from such different authorities as this\r\ndistinguished character and myself had access to, shows that there was\r\nsome general source entitled to credit.\r\n\r\nMr. Bentley’s[2.3.9] lists agree with Sir William Jones’s, exhibiting\r\nfifty-six and forty-six respectively for the last-mentioned Solar and\r\nLunar races. But, on a close comparison, he has either copied them or\r\ntaken from the same original source; afterwards transposing names which,\r\nthough aiding a likely hypothesis, will not accord with their historical\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\nColonel Wilford’s[2.3.10] Solar list is of no use; but his two dynasties\r\nof Puru and Yadu of the Lunar race are excellent, that part of the line\r\nof Puru, from Jarasandha to Chandragupta, being the only correct one in\r\nprint.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising Wilford did not make use of Sir William Jones’s Solar\r\nchronology; but he appears to have dreaded bringing down Rama to the\r\nperiod of Krishna, as he is known to have preceded by four generations\r\n‘the Great War’ of the Yadu races.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the Lunar line has reached us defective. It is\r\nsupposed so by their genealogists; and Wilford would have increased the\r\nerror by taking it as the standard, and reducing the Solar to conform\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\nMr. Bentley’s method is therefore preferable; namely, to suppose eleven\r\nprinces omitted in the Lunar between Janmejaya and Prachinvat. But as\r\nthere is no [34] authority for this, the Lunar princes are distributed\r\nin the tables collaterally with the Solar, preserving contemporaneous\r\naffinity where synchronisms will authorise. By this means all hypothesis\r\nwill be avoided, and the genealogies will speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nThere is very little difference between Sir William Jones’s and Colonel\r\nWilford’s lists, in that main branch of the Lunar race, of which Puru,\r\nHastin, Ajamidha, Kuru, Santanu, and Yudhishthira are the most\r\ndistinguished links. The coincidence is so near as to warrant a\r\nsupposition of identity of source; but close inspection shows Wilford to\r\nhave had a fuller supply, for he produces new branches, both of Hastin’s\r\nand Kuru’s progeny. He has also one name (Bhimasena) towards the close,\r\nwhich is in my lists, but not in Sir William Jones’s; and immediately\r\nfollowing Bhimasena, both these lists exhibit Dilipa, wanting in my copy\r\nof the Bhagavat, though contained in the Agni Purana: proofs of the\r\ndiversity of the sources of supply, and highly gratifying when the\r\nremoteness of those sources is considered. There is also in my lists\r\nTansu, the nineteenth from Budha, who is not in the lists either of Sir\r\nWilliam Jones or Wilford. Again; Wilford has a Suhotra preceding Hastin,\r\nwho is not in Sir William Jones’s genealogies.[2.3.11]\r\n\r\nAgain; Jahnu is made the successor to Kuru; whereas the Purana (whence\r\nmy extracts) makes Parikshit the successor, who adopts the son of Jahnu.\r\nThis son is Viduratha, who has a place in all three. Other variations\r\nare merely orthographical.\r\n\r\nA comparison of Sir William Jones’s Solar genealogies with my tables\r\nwill yield nearly the same satisfactory result as to original\r\nauthenticity. I say Sir William Jones’s list, because there is no other\r\nefficient one. We first differ at the fourth from Ikshwaku. In my list\r\nthis is Am-Prithu, of which he makes two names, Anenas and Prithu.\r\nThence to Purukutsa, the eighteenth, the difference is only in\r\northography. To Irisuaka, the twenty-third in mine, the twenty-sixth in\r\nSir William Jones’s list, one name is above accounted for; but here are\r\ntwo wanting in mine, Trasadasyu and Haryaswa. There is, also,\r\nconsiderable difference in the orthography of those names which we have\r\nin common. Again; we differ as to the successors of Champa, the\r\ntwenty-seventh, the founder of Champapur in Bihar. In Sir William’s,\r\nSadeva succeeds, and he is followed by Vijaya; but my authorities state\r\nthese both to be sons of Champa, and that Vijaya, the [35] younger, was\r\nhis successor, as the elder, Sadeva, took to religious austerity. The\r\nthirty-third and thirty-sixth, Kesi and Dilipa, are not noticed by Sir\r\nWilliam Jones; but there is a much more important person than either of\r\nthese omitted, who is a grand link of connexion, and affording a good\r\nsynchronism of the earliest history. This is Ambarisha, the fortieth,\r\nthe contemporary of Gadhi, who was the founder of Gadhipura or Kanauj.\r\nNala, Sarura, and Dilipa (Nos. 44, 45, 54 of my lists) are all omitted\r\nby Sir William Jones.\r\n\r\nThis comparative analysis of the chronologies of both these grand races\r\ncannot fail to be satisfactory. Those which I furnish are from the\r\nsacred genealogies in the library of a prince who claims common origin\r\nwith them, and are less liable to interpolation. There is scarcely a\r\nchief of character for knowledge who cannot repeat the genealogy of his\r\nline. The Prince of Mewar has a peculiarly retentive memory in this way.\r\nThe professed genealogists, the Bhats, must have them graven on their\r\nmemory, and the Charanas (the encomiasts) ought to be well versed\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nThe first table exhibits two dynasties of the Solar race of Princes of\r\nAyodhya and Mithila Des, or Tirhut, which latter I have seen nowhere\r\nelse. It also exhibits four great and three lesser dynasties of the\r\nLunar race; and an eighth line is added, of the race of Yadu, from the\r\nannals of the Bhatti tribe at Jaisalmer.\r\n\r\nEre quitting this halting-place in the genealogical history of the\r\nancient races, where the celebrated names of Rama, Krishna, and\r\nYudhishthira close the brazen age of India, and whose issue introduce\r\nthe present iron age, or Kali Yuga, I shall shortly refer to the few\r\nsynchronic points which the various authorities admit.\r\n\r\nOf periods so remote, approximations to truth are the utmost to be\r\nlooked for; and it is from the Ramayana and the Puranas these\r\nsynchronisms are hazarded.\r\n\r\n=Harischandra.=—The first commences with a celebrated name of the\r\nSolar line, Harischandra, son of Trisanku, still proverbial for\r\nhis humility.[2.3.12] He is the twenty-fourth,[2.3.13] and\r\ndeclared contemporary of Parasurama, who slew the celebrated\r\nSahasra-Arjuna[2.3.14] of [36] the Haihaya (Lunar) race, Prince of\r\nMahishmati on the Nerbudda. This is confirmed by the Ramayana,\r\nwhich details the destruction of the military class and assumption\r\nof political power by the Brahmans, under their chief Parasurama,\r\nmarking the period when the military class ‘lost the umbrella of\r\nroyalty,’ and, as the Brahmans ridiculously assert, their purity\r\nof blood. This last, however, their own books sufficiently\r\ncontradict, as the next synchronism will show.\r\n\r\n=Sagara.=—This synchronism we have in Sagara, the thirty-second prince\r\nof the Solar line, the contemporary of Talajangha, of the Lunar line,\r\nthe sixth in descent from Sahasra Arjuna, who had five sons preserved\r\nfrom the general slaughter of the military class by Parasurama, whose\r\nnames are given in the Bhavishya Purana.\r\n\r\nWars were constantly carried on between these great rival races, Surya\r\nand Indu, recorded in the Puranas and Ramayana. The Bhavishya describes\r\nthat between Sagara and Talajangha “to resemble that of their ancestors,\r\nin which the Haihayas suffered as severely as before.” But that they had\r\nrecovered all their power since Parasurama is evident from their having\r\ncompletely retaliated on the Suryas, and expelled the father[2.3.15] of\r\nSagara from his capital of Ayodhya. Sagara and Talajangha appear to have\r\nbeen contemporary with Hastin of Hastinapura, and with Anga, descended\r\nfrom Budha, the founder of Angadesa,[2.3.16] or Ongdesa, and the Anga\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n=Ambarisha.=—The Ramayana affords another synchronism; namely, that\r\nAmbarisha of Ayodhya, the fortieth prince of the Solar line, was the\r\ncontemporary of Gadhi, the founder of Kanauj, and of Lomapada the Prince\r\nof Angadesa.\r\n\r\n=Krishna.=—The last synchronism is that of Krishna and Yudhishthira,\r\nwhich terminates the [37] brazen, and introduces the Kali Yuga or iron\r\nage. But this is in the Lunar line; nor have we any guide by which the\r\ndifference can be adjusted between the appearance of Rama of the Solar\r\nand Krishna of the Lunar races.\r\n\r\nThus of the race of Krostu we have Kansa, Prince of Mathura, the\r\nfifty-ninth, and his cousin Krishna, the fifty-eighth from Budha; while\r\nof the line of Puru, descending through Ajamidha and Dvimidha, we have\r\nSalya, Jarasandha, and Yudhishthira, the fifty-first, fifty-third, and\r\nfifty-fourth respectively.\r\n\r\nThe race of Anga gives Prithusena as one of the actors and survivors of\r\nthe Mahabharata, and the fifty-third from Budha.\r\n\r\nThus, taking an average of the whole, we may consider fifty-five princes\r\nto be the number of descents from Budha to Krishna and Yudhishthira;\r\nand, admitting an average of twenty years for each reign, a period of\r\neleven hundred years; which being added to a like period calculated from\r\nthence to Vikramaditya, who reigned fifty-six years before Christ, I\r\nventure to place the establishment in India Proper of these two grand\r\nraces, distinctively called those of Surya and Chandra, at about 2256\r\nyears before the Christian era; at which period, though somewhat later,\r\nthe Egyptian, Chinese, and Assyrian monarchies are generally stated to\r\nhave been established,[2.3.17] and about a century and a half after that\r\ngreat event, the Flood.\r\n\r\nThough a passage in the Agni Purana indicates that the line of Surya, of\r\nwhich Ikshwaku was the head, was the first colony which entered India\r\nfrom Central Asia, yet we are compelled to place the patriarch Budha as\r\nhis contemporary, he being stated to have come from a distant region,\r\nand married to Ila, the sister of Ikshwaku.\r\n\r\nEre we proceed to make any remarks on the descendants of Krishna and\r\nArjuna, who carry on the Lunar line, or of the Kushites and Lavites,\r\nfrom Kusa and Lava, the sons of Rama, who carry on that of the Sun, a\r\nfew observations on the chief kingdoms established by their progenitors\r\non the continent of India will be hazarded in the ensuing Chapter [38].\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.3.1:\r\n\r\n  Herodotus ii. 99, 100.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.3.2:\r\n\r\n  The Egyptians claim the sun, also, as the first founder of the kingdom\r\n  of Egypt.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.3.3:\r\n\r\n  The Jaisalmer annals give in succession Prayag, Mathura, Kusasthala,\r\n  Dwaraka, as capitals of the Indu or Lunar race, in the ages preceding\r\n  the Bharat or Great War.

Muir, _Original\r\n  Sanskrit Texts_, i. 88 ff.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.3.13:\r\n\r\n  Sahyadri Khanda of the Skanda Purana.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.3.14:\r\n\r\n  In the Bhavishya Purana this prince, Sahasra-Arjuna, is termed a\r\n  Chakravartin, or paramount sovereign. It is said that he conquered\r\n  Karkotaka of the Takshak, Turushka, or Snake race, and brought with\r\n  him the population of Mahishmati, and founded Hemanagara in the north\r\n  of India, on his expulsion from his dominions on the Nerbudda.\r\n  Traditionary legends yet remain of this prince on the Nerbudda, where\r\n  he is styled Sahasrabahu, or ‘with a thousand arms,’ figurative of his\r\n  numerous progeny. The Takshak, or Snake race, here alluded to, will\r\n  hereafter engage our attention. The names of animals in early times,\r\n  planets, and things inanimate, all furnished symbolic appellations for\r\n  the various races. In Scripture we have the fly, the bee, the ram to\r\n  describe the princes of Egypt, Assyria, and Macedonia; here we have\r\n  the snake, horse, monkey, etc. The Snake or Takshak race was one of\r\n  the most extensive and earliest of Higher Asia, and celebrated in all\r\n  its extent, and to which I shall have to recur hereafter. [By the\r\n  Takshak race, so often referred to, the author seems to mean a body of\r\n  Scythian snake-worshippers. There are instances of a serpent barrow,\r\n  and of the use of the snake as a form of ornament among the Scythians;\r\n  but beyond this the evidence of worship of the serpent is scanty (E.\r\n  H. Minns, _Scythians and Greeks_, 328 f., 66 note, 294, 318, 323,\r\n  etc.). It was really the Takka, a Panjāb tribe (Beal, _Si-yu-ki_, i.\r\n  165 ff.; Cunningham, _Ancient Geography of India_, 148 ff.; Stein,\r\n  _Rājatarangini_, i. 204 f.).]\r\n\r\n  In the Ramayana it is stated that the sacrificial horse was stolen by\r\n  “a serpent (Takshak) assuming the form of Ananta.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.3.15:\r\n\r\n  “Asita, the father of Sagara, expelled by hostile kings of the\r\n  Haihayas, the Talajanghas, and the Sasa-vindus, fled to the Himavat\r\n  mountains, where he died, leaving his wives pregnant, and from one of\r\n  these Sagara was born” (Ramayana, i. 41). It was to preserve the Solar\r\n  race from the destruction which threatened it from the prolific Lunar\r\n  race, that the Brahman Parasurama armed: evidently proving that the\r\n  Brahmanical faith was held by the Solar race; while the religion of\r\n  Budha, the great progenitor of the Lunar, still governed his\r\n  descendants. This strengthened the opposition of the sages of the\r\n  Solar line to Vishvamitra’s (of Budha’s or the Lunar line) obtaining\r\n  Brahmanhood. That Krishna, of Lunar stock, prior to founding a new\r\n  sect, worshipped Budha, is susceptible of proof.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.3.16:\r\n\r\n  Angdes, Ongdes, or Undes adjoins Tibet. The inhabitants call\r\n  themselves Hungias, and appear to be the Hong-niu of the Chinese\r\n  authors, the Huns (Hūns) of Europe and India, which prove this Tartar\r\n  race to be Lunar, and of Budha. [Anga, the modern Bhāgalpur, is\r\n  confounded with Hundes or Tibet.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.3.17:\r\n\r\n  Egyptian, under Misraim, 2188 B.C.; Assyrian, 2059; Chinese, 2207.\r\n  [The first Egyptian dynasty is now dated 5500 B.C.; Chinese, 2852\r\n  B.C.; Babylonian, 2300 B.C. Any attempt to establish an Indian\r\n  chronology from the materials used by the Author does not promise to\r\n  be successful.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 4\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ayodhya.=—Ayodhya[2.4.1] was the first city founded by the race of\r\nSurya. Like other capitals, its importance must have risen by slow\r\ndegrees; yet making every allowance for exaggeration, it must have\r\nattained great splendour long anterior to Rama. Its site is well known\r\nat this day under the contracted name of Oudh, which also designates the\r\ncountry appertaining to the titular wazir of the Mogul empire; which\r\ncountry, twenty-five years ago, nearly marked the limits of Kosala, the\r\npristine kingdom of the Surya race. Overgrown greatness characterized\r\nall the ancient Asiatic capitals, and that of Ayodhya was immense.\r\nLucknow, the present capital, is traditionally asserted to have been one\r\nof the suburbs of ancient Oudh, and so named by Rama, in compliment to\r\nhis brother Lakshman.\r\n\r\n=Mithila.=—Nearly coeval in point of time with Ayodhya was\r\nMithila,[2.4.2] the capital of a country of the same name, founded by\r\nMithila, the grandson of Ikshwaku.\r\n\r\nThe name of Janaka,[2.4.3] son of Mithila, eclipsed that of the founder\r\nand became the patronymic of this branch of the Solar race.\r\n\r\n=Other Kingdoms.=—These are the two chief capitals of the kingdoms of\r\nthe Solar line described in [39] this early age; though there were\r\nothers of a minor order, such as Rohtas, Champapura,[2.4.4] etc., all\r\nfounded previously to Rama.\r\n\r\nBy the numerous dynasties of the Lunar race of Budha many kingdoms were\r\nfounded. Much has been said of the antiquity of Prayag; yet the first\r\ncapital of the Indu or Lunar race appears to have been founded by\r\nSahasra Arjuna, of the Haihaya tribe. This was Mahishmati on the\r\nNerbudda, still existing in Maheswar.[2.4.5] The rivalry between the\r\nLunar race and that of the Suryas of Ayodhya, in whose aid the\r\npriesthood armed, and expelled Sahasra Arjuna from Mahishmati, has been\r\nmentioned. A small branch of these ancient Haihayas[2.4.6] yet exist in\r\nthe line of the Nerbudda, near the very top of the valley at Sohagpur,\r\nin Baghelkhand, aware of their ancient lineage; and, though few in\r\nnumber, are still celebrated for their valour.[2.4.7]\r\n\r\n=Dwarka.=—Kusasthali Dwarka, the capital of Krishna, was founded prior\r\nto Prayag, to Surpur, or Mathura. The Bhagavat attributes the foundation\r\nof the city to Anrita, the brother of Ikshwaku, of the Solar race, but\r\nstates not how or when the Yadus became possessed thereof.\r\n\r\nThe ancient annals of the Jaisalmer family of the Yadu stock give the\r\npriority of foundation to Prayag, next to Mathura, and last to Dwarka.\r\nAll these cities are too well known to require description; especially\r\nPrayag, at the confluence of the Yamuna and Ganges. The Prasioi were the\r\ndescendants of Puru[2.4.8] of Prayag, visited by Megasthenes, ambassador\r\nof Seleucus, and the principal city of the Yadus, ere it sent forth the\r\nfour branches from Satwata. At Prayag resided the celebrated Bharat, the\r\nson of Sakuntala.\r\n\r\nIn the Ramayana the Sasavindus[2.4.9] (another Yadu race) are inscribed\r\nas allied with the Haihayas in the wars with the race of Surya; and of\r\nthis race was Sisupal[2.4.10] (the founder of Chedi[2.4.11]), one of the\r\nfoes of Krishna [40].\r\n\r\n=Surpur.=—We are assured by Alexander’s historians that the country and\r\npeople round Mathura, when he invaded India, were termed Surasenoi.\r\nThere are two princes of the name of Sursen in the immediate ancestry of\r\nKrishna; one his grandfather, the other eight generations anterior.\r\nWhich of these founded the capital Surpur,[2.4.12] whence the country\r\nand inhabitants had their appellation, we cannot say. Mathura and\r\nCleisobara are mentioned by the historians of Alexander as the chief\r\ncities of the Surasenoi. Though the Greeks sadly disfigure names, we\r\ncannot trace any affinity between Cleisobara and Surpur.\r\n\r\n=Hastinapura.=—The city of Hastinapura was built by Hastin a name\r\ncelebrated in the Lunar dynasties. The name of this city is still\r\npreserved on the Ganges, about forty miles south of Hardwar,[2.4.13]\r\nwhere the Ganges breaks through the Siwalik mountains and enters the\r\nplains of India. This mighty stream, rolling its masses of waters from\r\nthe glaciers of the Himalaya, and joined by many auxiliary streams,\r\nfrequently carries destruction before it. In one night a column of\r\nthirty feet in perpendicular height has been known to bear away all\r\nwithin its sweep, and to such an occurrence the capital of Hastin is\r\nsaid to have owed its ruin.[2.4.14] As it existed, however, long after\r\nthe Mahabharata, it is surprising it is not mentioned by the historians\r\nof Alexander, who invaded India probably about eight centuries after\r\nthat event. In this abode of the sons of Puru resided Porus, one of the\r\ntwo princes of that name, opponents of Alexander, and probably Bindusara\r\nthe son of Chandragupta, surmised to be the Abisares[2.4.15] and\r\nSandrakottos of Grecian authorities. Of the two princes named Porus\r\nmentioned by Alexander’s [41] historians, one resided in the very cradle\r\nof the Puru dynasties; the abode of the other bordered on the Panjab:\r\nwarranting an assertion that the Pori of Alexander were of the Lunar\r\nrace, and destroying all the claims various authors[2.4.16] have\r\nadvanced on behalf of the princes of Mewar.[2.4.17]\r\n\r\nHastin sent forth three grand branches, Ajamidha, Dvimidha, and\r\nPurumidha. Of the two last we lose sight altogether; but Ajamidha’s\r\nprogeny spread over all the northern parts of India, in the Panjab and\r\nacross the Indus. The period, probably one thousand six hundred years\r\nbefore Christ.\r\n\r\nFrom Ajamidha,[2.4.18] in the fourth generation, was Bajaswa, who\r\nobtained possessions towards the Indus, and whose five sons gave their\r\nname, Panchala, to the Panjab, or space watered by the five rivers. The\r\ncapital founded by the younger brother, Kampila, was named\r\nKampilnagara.[2.4.19]\r\n\r\nThe descendants of Ajamidha by his second wife, Kesini, founded another\r\nkingdom and dynasty, celebrated in the heroic history of Northern India.\r\nThis is the Kausika dynasty.\r\n\r\n=Kanauj.=—Kusa had four sons, two of whom, Kusanabha and Kusamba, are\r\nwell known to traditional history, and by the still surviving cities\r\nfounded by them. Kusanabha founded the city of Mahodaya on the Ganges,\r\nafterwards changed to Kanyakubja, or Kanauj, which maintained its\r\ncelebrity until the Muhammadan invasion of Shihabu-d-din (A.D. 1193),\r\nwhen this overgrown city was laid prostrate for ever. It was not\r\nunfrequently called Gadhipura, or the ‘city of Gadhi.’ This practice of\r\nmultiplying names of cities in the east is very destructive to history.\r\nAbu-l Fazl has taken from Hindu authorities an account of Kanauj; and\r\ncould we admit the authority of a poet on such subjects, Chand, the bard\r\nof Prithwiraja,[2.4.20] would afford materials. Ferishta states it in\r\nthe early ages to have been twenty-five coss [42] (thirty-five miles) in\r\ncircumference, and that there were thirty thousand shops for the sale of\r\nthe areca or beetle-nut only;[2.4.21] and this in the sixth century, at\r\nwhich period the Rathor dynasty, which terminated with Jaichand, in the\r\ntwelfth, had been in possession from the end of the fifth century.\r\n\r\nKusamba also founded a city, called after his own name Kausambi.[2.4.22]\r\nThe name was in existence in the eleventh century; and ruins might yet\r\nexist, if search were made on the shores of the Ganges, from Kanauj\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nThe other sons built two capitals, Dharmaranya and Vasumati; but of\r\nneither have we any correct knowledge.\r\n\r\nKuru had two sons, Sudhanush and Parikhshita. The descendants of the\r\nformer terminated with Jarasandha, whose capital was Rajagriha (the\r\nmodern Rajmahal) on the Ganges, in the province of Bihar.[2.4.23] From\r\nParikhshita descended the monarchs Santanu and Balaka: the first\r\nproducing the rivals of the Great War, Yudhishthira and Duryodhana; the\r\nother the Balakaputras.\r\n\r\nDuryodhana, the successor to the throne of Kuru, resided at the ancient\r\ncapital, Hastinapura; while the junior branch, Yudhishthira, founded\r\nIndraprastha, on the Yamuna or Jumna, which name in the eighth century\r\nwas changed to Delhi.\r\n\r\nThe sons of Balaka founded two kingdoms: Palibothra, on the lower\r\nGanges; and Aror,[2.4.24] on the eastern bank of the Indus, founded by\r\nSahl [43].\r\n\r\nOne great arm of the tree of Yayati remains unnoticed, that of Uru or\r\nUrvasu, written by others Turvasu. Uru was the father of a line of kings\r\nwho founded several empires. Virupa, the eighth prince from Uru, had\r\neight sons, two of whom are particularly mentioned as sending forth two\r\ngrand shoots, Druhyu and Bhabru. From Druhyu a dynasty was established\r\nin the north. Aradwat, with his son Gandhara, is stated to have founded\r\na State: Prachetas is said to have become king of Mlecchhades, or the\r\nbarbarous regions. This line terminated with Dushyanta, the husband of\r\nthe celebrated Sakuntala, father of Bharat, and who, labouring under the\r\ndispleasure of some offended deity, is said by the Hindus to have been\r\nthe cause of all the woes which subsequently befell the race. The four\r\ngrandsons of Dushyanta, Kalanjar, Keral, Pand, and Chaul, gave their\r\nnames to countries.\r\n\r\n=Kalanjar.=—Kalanjar is the celebrated fortress in Bundelkhand, so well\r\nknown for its antiquities, which have claimed considerable notice.\r\n\r\n=Kerala.=—Of the second, Kerala, it is only known that in the list of\r\nthe thirty-six royal races in the twelfth century, the Kerala makes one,\r\nbut the capital is unknown.[2.4.25]\r\n\r\n=Pandya.=—The kingdom founded by Pand may be that on the coast of\r\nMalabar, the Pandu-Mandal of the Hindus, the Regia Pandiona of the\r\ngeographers of the west, and of which, probably, Tanjore is the modern\r\ncapital.[2.4.26]\r\n\r\n=Chaul.=—Chaul[2.4.27] is in the Saurashtra peninsula, and on the coast,\r\ntowards Jagat Khunt, ‘the world’s end,’ and still retains its\r\nappellation.\r\n\r\n=Anga.=—The other shoot from Bhabru became celebrated. The thirty-fourth\r\nprince, Anga, founded the kingdom of Angadesa, of which\r\nChampapuri[2.4.28] was the [44] capital, established about the same time\r\nwith Kanauj, probably fifteen hundred years before Christ. With him the\r\npatronymic was changed, and the Anga race became famous in ancient Hindu\r\nhistory; and to this day Un-des still designates the Alpine regions of\r\nTibet bordering on Chinese Tartary.\r\n\r\nPrithusena terminates the line of Anga; and as he survived the disasters\r\nof the Great War, his race probably multiplied in those regions, where\r\ncaste appears never to have been introduced.\r\n\r\n=Recapitulation.=—Thus have we rapidly reviewed the dynasties of Surya\r\nand Chandra, from Manu and Budha to Rama, Krishna, Yudhishthira, and\r\nJarasandha; establishing, it is hoped, some new points, and perhaps\r\nadding to the credibility of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe wrecks of almost all the vast cities founded by them are yet to be\r\ntraced in ruins. The city of Ikshwaku and Rama, on the Sarju;\r\nIndraprastha, Mathura, Surpura, Prayag on the Yamuna; Hastinapura,\r\nKanyakubja, Rajagriha on the Ganges; Maheswar on the Nerbudda; Aror on\r\nthe Indus; and Kusasthali Dwarka on the shore of the Indian Ocean. Each\r\nhas left some memorial of former grandeur: research may discover others.\r\n\r\nThere is yet an unexplored region in Panchala; Kampilanagara its\r\ncapital, and those cities established west of the Indus by the sons of\r\nBajaswa.\r\n\r\nTraces of the early Indo-Scythic nations may possibly reward the search\r\nof some adventurous traveller who may penetrate into Transoxiana, on the\r\nsites of Cyropolis, and the most northern Alexandria; in Balkh, and\r\namidst the caves of Bamian.\r\n\r\nThe plains of India retain yet many ancient cities, from whose ruins\r\nsomewhat may be gleaned to add a mite to knowledge; and where\r\ninscriptions may be found in a character which, though yet\r\nunintelligible, will not always remain so in this age of discovery. For\r\nsuch let the search be general, and when once a key is obtained, they\r\nwill enlighten each other. Wherever the races of Kuru, Uru, and Yadu\r\nhave swayed, have been found ancient and yet undeciphered characters.\r\n\r\nMuch would reward him who would make a better digest of the historical\r\nand geographical matter in the Puranas. But we must discard the idea\r\nthat the history of Rama, the Mahabharata of Krishna and the five\r\nPandava[2.4.29] brothers, are [45] mere allegory: an idea supported by\r\nsome, although their races, their cities, and their coins still exist.\r\nLet us master the characters on the columns of Indraprastha, of Prayag\r\nand Mewar, on the rocks of Junagarh,[2.4.30] at Bijolli, on the\r\nAravalli, and in the Jain temples scattered over India, and then we\r\nshall be able to arrive at just and satisfactory conclusions.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.1:\r\n\r\n  The picture drawn by Valmiki of the capital of the Solar race is so\r\n  highly coloured that Ayodhya might stand for Utopia, and it would be\r\n  difficult to find such a catalogue of metropolitan embellishments in\r\n  this, the iron age of Oudh. \"On the banks of the Surayu is a large\r\n  country called Kosala, in which is Ayodhya, built by Manu, twelve\r\n  yojans (forty-eight miles) in extent, with streets regular and well\r\n  watered. It was filled with merchants, beautified by gardens,\r\n  ornamented with stately gates and high-arched porticoes, furnished\r\n  with arms, crowded with chariots, elephants, and horses, and with\r\n  ambassadors from foreign lands; embellished with palaces whose domes\r\n  resembled the mountain tops, dwellings of equal height, resounding\r\n  with the delightful music of the tabor, the flute, and the harp. It\r\n  was surrounded by an impassable moat, and guarded by archers.\r\n  Dasaratha was its king, a mighty charioteer. There were no atheists.\r\n  The affections of the men were in their consorts. The women were\r\n  chaste and obedient to their lords, endowed with beauty, wit,\r\n  sweetness, prudence, and industry, with bright ornaments and fair\r\n  apparel; the men devoted to truth and hospitality, regardful of their\r\n  superiors, their ancestors, and their gods.\r\n\r\n  “There were eight councillors; two chosen priests profound in the law,\r\n  besides another inferior council of six. Of subdued appetites,\r\n  disinterested, forbearing, pleasant, patient; not avaricious; well\r\n  acquainted with their duties and popular customs; attentive to the\r\n  army, the treasury; impartially awarding punishment even on their own\r\n  sons; never oppressing even an enemy; not arrogant; comely in dress;\r\n  never confident about doubtful matters; devoted to the sovereign.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.2:\r\n\r\n  Mithila, the modern Tirhut in Bengal [including the modern districts\r\n  of Darbhanga, Champāran, and Muzaffarpur].\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.3:\r\n\r\n  Kusadhwaja, father of Sita (spouse of Rama), is also called Janaka; a\r\n  name common in this line, and borne by the third prince in succession\r\n  after Suvarna Roma, the ‘golden-haired’ chief Mithila.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.4:\r\n\r\n  [Rohtās in the modern Shāhābād district; Champapura in Bhāgalpur.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.5:\r\n\r\n  Familiarly designated as Sahasra Bahu ki Basti, or ‘the town of the\r\n  thousand-armed.’ [In Indore State (_IGI_, xvii. 8).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.6:\r\n\r\n  The Haihaya race, of the line of Budha, may claim affinity with the\r\n  Chinese race which first gave monarchs to China [?].\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.7:\r\n\r\n  Of this I have heard the most romantic proofs in very recent times.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.8:\r\n\r\n  Puru became the patronymic of this branch of the Lunar race. Of this\r\n  Alexander’s historians made Porus. The Suraseni of Methoras\r\n  (descendants of the Sursen of Mathura) were all Purus, the Prasioi of\r\n  Megasthenes [see p. 37, n.]. Allahabad yet retains its Hindu name of\r\n  Prayag, pronounced Prag.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.9:\r\n\r\n  The Hares. Sesodia is said to have the same derivation. [From Sesoda\r\n  in Mewār.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.10:\r\n\r\n  The princes of Ranthambhor, expelled by Prithwiraja of Delhi, were of\r\n  this race.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.11:\r\n\r\n  The modern Chanderi [in the Gwalior State, _IGI_, x. 163 f.] is said\r\n  to be this capital, and one of the few to which no Englishman has\r\n  obtained entrance, though I tried hard in 1807. Doubtless it would\r\n  afford food for curiosity; for, being out of the path of armies in the\r\n  days of conquest and revolution, it may, and I believe does, retain\r\n  much worthy of research. [The capital of the Chedi or Kalachuri\r\n  dynasty was Tripura or Karanbel, near Jabalpur (_IGI_, x. 12).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.12:\r\n\r\n  I had the pleasure, in 1814, of discovering a remnant of this city,\r\n  which the Yamuna has overwhelmed. [The ancient Sūryapura was near\r\n  Batesar, 40 miles south-east of Agra city. Sir H. Elliot\r\n  (_Supplemental Glossary_, 187) remarks that it is strange that the\r\n  Author so often claims the credit of discovery when its position is\r\n  fixed in a set of familiar verses. For Sūryapura see A. Führer,\r\n  _Monumental Antiquities and Inscriptions_, 69.] The sacred place of\r\n  pilgrimage, Batesar, stands on part of it. My discovery of it was\r\n  doubly gratifying, for while I found out the Surasenoi of the Greeks,\r\n  I obtained a medal of the little known Apollodotus, who carried his\r\n  arms to the mouths of the Indus, and possibly to the centre of the\r\n  land of the Yadus. He is not included by Bayer in his lists of the\r\n  kings of Bactria, but we have only an imperfect knowledge of the\r\n  extent of that dynasty. The Bhagavat Purana asserts thirteen Yavan or\r\n  Ionian princes to have ruled in Balichdes [?] or Bactria, in which\r\n  they mention Pushpamitra Dvimitra. We are justified in asserting this\r\n  to be Demetrius, the son of Euthydemus, but who did not succeed his\r\n  father, as Menander intervened. Of this last conqueror I also possess\r\n  a medal, obtained amongst the Surasenoi, and struck in commemoration\r\n  of victory, as the winged messenger of heavenly peace extends the palm\r\n  branch from her hand. These two will fill up a chasm in the Bactrian\r\n  annals, for Menander is well known to them. Apollodotus would have\r\n  perished but for Arrian, who wrote the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea\r\n  in the second century, while commercial agent at Broach, or\r\n  classically Brigukachchha, the Barugaza of the Greeks. [The Periplus\r\n  of the Erythraean Sea was written by an unknown Greek merchant of\r\n  first century A.D. (McCrindle, _Commerce and Navigation_, Introd. p.\r\n  1).]\r\n\r\n  Without the notice this writer has afforded us, my Apollodotus would\r\n  have lost half its value. Since my arrival in Europe I have also been\r\n  made acquainted with the existence of a medal of Demetrius, discovered\r\n  in Bokhara, and on which an essay has been written by a _savant_ at\r\n  St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.13:\r\n\r\n  The portal of Hari or Hara, whose trisula or trident is there.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.14:\r\n\r\n  Wilford says this event is mentioned in two Puranas as occurring in\r\n  the sixth or eighth generation of the Great War. Those who have\r\n  travelled in the Duab must have remarked where both the Ganges and\r\n  Jumna have shifted their beds.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.15:\r\n\r\n  [Abisares is Abhisāra in the modern Kashmīr State (Smith, _EHI_, 59).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.16:\r\n\r\n  Sir Thomas Roe; Sir Thomas Herbert; the Holstein ambassador (by\r\n  Olearius); Della Valle; Churchill, in his collection: and borrowing\r\n  from these, D’Anville, Bayer, Orme, Rennell, etc.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.17:\r\n\r\n  The ignorance of the family of Mewar of the fact would by no means be\r\n  a conclusive argument against it, could it be otherwise substantiated;\r\n  but the race of Surya was completely eclipsed at that period by the\r\n  Lunar and new races which soon poured in from the west of the Indus,\r\n  and in time displaced them all.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.18:\r\n\r\n  Ajamidha, by his wife Nila, had five sons, who spread their branches\r\n  (Sakha) on both sides the Indus. Regarding three the Puranas are\r\n  silent, which implies their migration to distant regions. Is it\r\n  possible they might be the origin of the Medes? These Medes are\r\n  descendants of Yayati, third son of the patriarch Manu; and Madai,\r\n  founder of the Medes, was of Japhet’s line. Ajamidha, the patronymic\r\n  of the branch of Bajaswa, is from _Aja_, ‘a goat.’ The Assyrian Mede,\r\n  in Scripture, is typified by the goat. [These speculations are\r\n  worthless.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.19:\r\n\r\n  Of this house was Draupadi, the wife, in common, of the five Pandava\r\n  brothers: manners peculiar to Scythia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.20:\r\n\r\n  King of Delhi.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.21:\r\n\r\n  [Briggs i. 57. The accounts of the size of the city are extravagant\r\n  (Elphinstone, _HI_, 332 note; Cunningham, _ASR_, i. 279 ff.).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.22:\r\n\r\n  An inscription was discovered at Kara on the Ganges, in which Yaspal\r\n  is mentioned as prince of the realm of Kausambi (_As. Res._ vol. ix.\r\n  p. 440). Wilford, in his Essay on the Geography of the Purans, says\r\n  “Causambi, near Alluhabad” (_As. Res._ vol. xiv.). [The site is\r\n  uncertain (Smith, _EHI_, 293, note).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.23:\r\n\r\n  [Rājgīr in Patna District.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.24:\r\n\r\n  Aror, or Alor, was the capital of Sind in remote antiquity: a bridge\r\n  over the stream which branched from the Indus, near Dara, is almost\r\n  the sole vestige of this capital of the Sogdoi of Alexander. On its\r\n  site the shepherds of the desert have established an extensive hamlet;\r\n  it is placed on a ridge of siliceous rock, seven miles east of the\r\n  insular Bakhar, and free from the inundations of the Indus. The Sodha\r\n  tribe, a powerful branch of the Pramara race, has ruled in these\r\n  countries from remote antiquity, and to a very late period they were\r\n  lords of Umarkot and Umrasumra, in which divisions was Aror. Sahl and\r\n  his capital were known to Abu-l Fazl, though he was ignorant of its\r\n  position, which he transferred to Debal, or Dewal, the modern Tatta.\r\n  This indefatigable historian thus describes it: “In ancient times\r\n  there lived a raja named Siharas (Sahl), whose capital was Alor, and\r\n  his dominions extended north to Kashmīr and south to the ocean”\r\n  [_Āīn_, ii. 343]. Sahl, or Sahr, became a titular appellation of the\r\n  country, its princes, and its inhabitants, the Sehraes. [See p. 21\r\n  above.] Alor appears to have been the capital of the kingdom of\r\n  Sigerdis, conquered by Menander of Bactria. Ibn Haukal, the Arabian\r\n  geographer, mentions it; but a superfluous point in writing has\r\n  changed Aror into Azor, or Azour, as translated by Sir W. Ouseley. The\r\n  illustrious D’Anville mentions it; but, in ignorance of its position,\r\n  quoting Abulfeda. says, in grandeur “Azour est presque comparable à\r\n  Mooltan.” I have to claim the discovery of several ancient capital\r\n  cities in the north of India: Surpur, on the Jumna, the capital of the\r\n  Yadus; Alor, on the Indus, the capital of the Sodhas; Mandodri,\r\n  capital of the Pariharas; Chandravati, at the foot of the Aravalli\r\n  mountains; and Valabhipura, in Gujarat, capital of the Balaka-raes,\r\n  the Balharas of Arab travellers. The Bala Rajput of Saurashtra may\r\n  have given the name to Valabhipura, as descendants of Balaka, from\r\n  Sahl of Aror. The blessing of the bard to them is yet, Tatta Multān ka\r\n  Rāo (‘lord of Tatta and Multan,’ the seats of the Balaka-putras): nor\r\n  is it improbable that a branch of these under the Indian Hercules,\r\n  Balaram, who left India after the Great War, may have founded Balich,\r\n  or Balkh, emphatically called the ‘mother of cities.’ The Jaisalmer\r\n  annals assert that the Yadu and Balaka branches of the Indu race ruled\r\n  Khorasan after the Great War, the Indo-Scythic races of Grecian\r\n  authors. Besides the Balakas, and the numerous branches of the\r\n  Indo-Medes, many of the sons of Kuru dispersed over these regions:\r\n  amongst whom we may place Uttara Kuru (_Northern Kurus_) of the\r\n  Puranas, the Ottorokorrhai of the Greek authors. Both the Indu and\r\n  Surya races were eternally sending their superfluous population to\r\n  those distant regions, when probably the same primeval religion\r\n  governed the races east and west of the Indus. [Much of this is\r\n  incorrect.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.25:\r\n\r\n  [The Chera or Kerala kingdom comprised the Southern Konkans or Malabar\r\n  coast, the present Malabar district with Travancore and Cochin, the\r\n  dynasty being in existence early in the Christian era (Smith, _EHI_,\r\n  447; _IGI_, x. 192 f.).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.26:\r\n\r\n  [The Pāndya kingdom included the Madura and Tinnevelly districts, with\r\n  parts of Trichinopoly, and sometimes Travancore, its capitals being\r\n  Madura, or Kūdal, and Korkai (Smith, _op. cit._ 449 f.; _IGI_, xix.\r\n  394 f.).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.27:\r\n\r\n  From Chaul on the coast, in journeying towards Junagarh, and about\r\n  seven miles from the former, are the remains of an ancient city.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.28:\r\n\r\n  From the description in the Ramayana of King Dasaratha proceeding to\r\n  Champamalina, the capital of Lomapada, king of Anga (sixth in descent\r\n  from the founder), it is evident that it was a very mountainous\r\n  region, and the deep forests and large rivers presented serious\r\n  obstructions to his journey. From this I should imagine it impossible\r\n  that Angadesa should apply to a portion of Bengal, in which there is a\r\n  Champamalina, described by Colonel Francklin in his Essay on\r\n  Palibothra. [The Anga kingdom, with its capital at Champapuri, near\r\n  Bhāgalpur, corresponded to the modern districts of North Monghyr,\r\n  North Bhāgalpur, and Purnea west of the Mahananda river (_IGI_, v.\r\n  373).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.29:\r\n\r\n  The history and exploits of the Pandavas and Harikulas are best known\r\n  in the most remote parts of India: amidst the forest-covered mountains\r\n  of Saurashtra, the deep woods and caves of Hidimba and Virat (still\r\n  the shelter of the savage Bhil and Koli), or on the craggy banks of\r\n  the Charmanvati (Chambal). In each, tradition has localized the\r\n  shelter of these heroes when exiled from the Yamuna; and colossal\r\n  figures cut from the mountain, ancient temples and caves inscribed\r\n  with characters yet unknown, attributed to the Pandavas, confirm the\r\n  legendary tale.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.4.30:\r\n\r\n  The ‘ancient city,’ _par eminence_, is the only name this old capital,\r\n  at the foot of, and guarding, the sacred mount Girnar, is known by.\r\n  Abu-l Fazl says it had long remained desolate and unknown, and was\r\n  discovered by mere accident. [_Āīn_, ii. 245. For a description of the\r\n  place see _BG_, viii. 487; E. C. Bayley, _Local Muhammadan Dynasties,\r\n  Gujarāt_, 182 ff.] Tradition even being silent, they gave it the\r\n  emphatic appellation of Juna (old) Garh (fortress). I have little\r\n  doubt that it is the Asaldurga, or Asalgarh, of the Guhilot annals;\r\n  where it is said that prince Asal raised a fortress, called after him,\r\n  near to Girnar, by the consent of the Dabhi prince, his uncle.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 5\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving investigated the line from Ikshwaku to Rama, and that from Budha\r\n(the parent and first emigrant of the Indu[2.5.1] race, from Saka Dwipa,\r\nor Scythia, to Hindustan) to Krishna and Yudhishthira, a period of\r\ntwelve hundred years, we proceed to the second division and second table\r\nof the genealogies.\r\n\r\n=The Suryavansa or Solar Line.=—From Rama all the tribes termed\r\nSuryavansa, or ‘Race of the Sun,’ claim descent, as the present princes\r\nof Mewar, Jaipur, Marwar, Bikaner, and their numerous clans; while from\r\nthe Lunar (Indu) line of Budha and Krishna, the families of Jaisalmer\r\nand Cutch (the Bhatti[2.5.2] and Jareja races), extending throughout the\r\nIndian desert from the Sutlej to the ocean, deduce their pedigrees.\r\n\r\nRama preceded Krishna: but as their historians, Valmiki and Vyasa, who\r\nwrote the events they witnessed, were contemporaries, it could not have\r\nbeen by many years [46].\r\n\r\nThe present table contains the dynasties which succeeded these great\r\nbeacons of the Solar and Lunar races, and are three in number.[2.5.3]\r\n\r\n1. The Suryavansa, descendants of Rama.\r\n\r\n2. The Induvansa, descendants of Pandu through Yudhishthira.\r\n\r\n3. The Induvansa, descendants of Jarasandha, monarch of Rajagriha.\r\n\r\nThe Bhagavat and Agni Puranas are the authorities for the lines from\r\nRama and Jarasandha; while that of Pandu is from the Raja Tarangini and\r\nRajavali.\r\n\r\nThe existing Rajput tribes of the Solar race claim descent from Lava and\r\nKusa, the two elder sons of Rama; nor do I believe any existing tribes\r\ntrace their ancestry to his other children, or to his brothers.\r\n\r\nFrom the eldest son, Lava, the Ranas of Mewar claim descent: so do the\r\nBargujar tribe, formerly powerful within the confines of the present\r\nAmber, whose representative now dwells at Anupshahr on the Ganges.\r\n\r\nFrom Kusa descend the Kachhwaha[2.5.4] princes of Narwar and Amber, and\r\ntheir numerous clans. Amber, though the first in power, is but a scion\r\nof Narwar, transplanted about one thousand years back, whose chief, the\r\nrepresentative of the celebrated Prince Nala, enjoys but a sorry\r\ndistrict[2.5.5] of all his ancient possessions.\r\n\r\nThe house of Marwar also claims descent from this stem, which appears to\r\noriginate in an error of the genealogists, confounding the race of Kusa\r\nwith the Kausika of Kanauj and Kausambi. Nor do the Solar genealogists\r\nadmit this assumed pedigree.\r\n\r\nThe Amber prince in his genealogies traces the descent of the\r\nMewar[2.5.6] family from Rama to Sumitra, through Lava, the eldest\r\nbrother, and not through Kusa,[2.5.7] as in some copies of the Puranas,\r\nand in that whence Sir William Jones had his lists [47].\r\n\r\nMr. Bentley, taking this genealogy from the same authority as Sir\r\nWilliam Jones, has mutilated it by a transposition, for which his\r\nreasons are insufficient, and militate against every opinion of the\r\nHindus. Finding the names Vrihadbala and Vridasura, declared to be\r\nprinces contemporary with Yudhishthira, he transposes the whole ten\r\nprinces of his list intervening between Takshak[2.5.8] and\r\nBahuman.[2.5.9]\r\n\r\nBahuman,[2.5.10] or ‘the man with arms’ (Darazdasht or Longimanus) is\r\nthe thirty-fourth prince from Rama; and his reign must be placed nearly\r\nintermediate between Rama and Sumitra, or his contemporary Vikrama, and\r\nin the sixth century from either.\r\n\r\nSumitra concludes the line of Surya or Rama from the Bhagavat Purana.\r\nThence it is connected with the present line of Mewar, by Jai Singh’s\r\nauthorities; which list has been compared with various others, chiefly\r\nJain, as will be related in the annals of Mewar.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the line of Surya exhibits fifty-six princes, from\r\nLava, the son of Rama, to Sumitra, the last prince given in the Puranas.\r\nSir William Jones exhibits fifty-seven.\r\n\r\nTo these fifty-six reigns I should be willing to allow the average of\r\ntwenty years, which would give 1120 from Rama to Sumitra, who preceded\r\nby a short period Vikramaditya; and as 1100 have been already calculated\r\nto have preceded the era of Rama and Yudhishthira, the inference is,\r\nthat 2200 years elapsed from Ikshwaku, the founder of the Solar line, to\r\nSumitra.\r\n\r\n=Chandravansa or the Lunar Line.=—From the Raja Tarangini and Rajavali\r\nthe Induvansa family (descendants of Pandu through Yudhishthira) is\r\nsupplied. These works, celebrated in Rajwara as collections of\r\ngenealogies and historical facts, by the Pandits Vidyadhara and\r\nRaghunath, were compiled under the eye of the most learned prince of his\r\nperiod, Sawai Jai Singh of Amber, and give the various dynasties which\r\nruled at Indraprastha, or Delhi, from Yudhishthira to Vikramaditya; and\r\nalthough barren of events, may be considered of value in filling up a\r\nperiod of entire darkness [48].\r\n\r\nThe Tarangini commences with Adinath[2.5.11] or Rishabhdeva,[2.5.12]\r\nbeing the Jain[2.5.13] theogony. Rapidly noticing the leading princes of\r\nthe dynasties discussed, they pass to the birth of the kings\r\nDhritarashtra and Pandu, and their offspring, detailing the causes of\r\ntheir civil strife, to that conflict termed the Mahabharata or Great\r\nWar.\r\n\r\n=The Pandava Family.=—The origin of every family, whether of east or\r\nwest, is involved in fable. That of the Pandu[2.5.14] is entitled to as\r\nmuch credence as the birth of Romulus, or other founders of a race.\r\n\r\nSuch traditions[2.5.15] were probably invented to cover some great\r\ndisgrace in the Pandu family, and have relation to the story already\r\nrelated of Vyasa, and the debasement of this branch of the Harikulas.\r\nAccordingly, on the death of Pandu, Duryodhana, nephew of Pandu (son of\r\nDhritarashtra, who from blindness could not inherit), asserted their\r\nillegitimacy before the assembled kin at Hastinapura. With the aid,\r\nhowever, of the priesthood, and the blind Dhritarashtra, his nephew,\r\nYudhishthira, elder son of Pandu, was invested by him with the seal of\r\nroyalty, in the capital, Hastinapura.\r\n\r\nDuryodhana’s plots against the Pandu and his partisans were so numerous\r\nthat the five brothers determined to leave for a while their ancestral\r\nabodes on the Ganges. They sought shelter in foreign countries about the\r\nIndus, and were first protected by Drupada, king of Panchala, at whose\r\ncapital, Kampilanagara, the surrounding princes had arrived as suitors\r\nfor the hand of his daughter, Draupadi.[2.5.16] But the prize was\r\ndestined for the exiled Pandu, and the skill of Arjuna in archery\r\nobtained him the fair, who “threw round his neck the (barmala) garland\r\nof marriage.” The disappointed princes indulged their resentment against\r\nthe exile; but by Arjuna’s bow they suffered the fate of Penelope’s\r\nsuitors, and the Pandu brought home his bride, who became the wife in\r\ncommon of the five brothers: manners[2.5.17] decisively Scythic [49].\r\n\r\nThe deeds of the brothers abroad were bruited in Hastinapura and the\r\nblind Dhritarashtra’s influence effected their recall. To stop, however,\r\ntheir intestine feuds, he partitioned the Pandu sovereignty; and while\r\nhis son, Duryodhana, retained Hastinapura, Yudhishthira founded the new\r\ncapital of Indraprastha; but shortly after the Mahabharata he abdicated\r\nin favour of his grand-nephew, Parikshita, introducing a new era, called\r\nafter himself, which existed for eleven hundred years, when it was\r\noverturned, and Indraprastha was conquered by Vikramaditya Tuar of\r\nUjjain, of the same race, who established an era of his own.\r\n\r\nOn the division of the Pandu sovereignty, the new kingdom of\r\nIndraprastha eclipsed that of Hastinapura. The brothers reduced to\r\nobedience the surrounding[2.5.18] nations, and compelled their princes\r\nto sign tributary engagements (_paenama_).[2.5.19]\r\n\r\nYudhishthira, firmly seated on his throne, determined to signalize his\r\nreign and paramount sovereignty, by the imposing and solemn rites of\r\nAsvamedha[2.5.20] and Rajasuya.\r\n\r\n=The Asvamedha.=—In these magnificent ceremonies, in which princes alone\r\nofficiate, every duty, down to that of porter, is performed by royalty.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Steed of Sacrifice’ was liberated under Arjuna’s care, having\r\nwandered whither he listed for twelve months; and none daring to accept\r\nthis challenge of supremacy, he was reconducted to Indraprastha, where,\r\nin the meanwhile, the hall of sacrifice was prepared, and all the\r\nprinces of the land were summoned to attend.\r\n\r\nThe hearts of the Kurus[2.5.21] burned with envy at the assumption of\r\nsupremacy by the Pandus, for the Prince of Hastinapura’s office was to\r\nserve out the sacred food [50].\r\n\r\nThe rivalry between the races burst forth afresh; but Duryodhana, who so\r\noften failed in his schemes against the safety of his antagonists,\r\ndetermined to make the virtue of Yudhishthira the instrument of his\r\nsuccess. He availed himself of the national propensity for play, in\r\nwhich the Rajput continues to preserve his Scythic[2.5.22] resemblance.\r\nYudhishthira fell into the snare prepared for him. He lost his kingdom,\r\nhis wife, and even his personal liberty and that of his brothers, for\r\ntwelve years, and became an exile from the plains of the Yamuna.\r\n\r\nThe traditional history of these wanderers during the term of probation,\r\ntheir many lurking places now sacred, the return to their ancestral\r\nabodes, and the grand battle (Mahabharata) which ensued, form highly\r\ninteresting episodes in the legends of Hindu antiquity.\r\n\r\nTo decide this civil strife, every tribe and chief of fame, from the\r\nCaucasus to the ocean, assembled on Kurukshetra, the field on which the\r\nempire of India has since more than once been contested[2.5.23] and\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nThis combat was fatal to the dominant influence of the “fifty-six tribes\r\nof Yadu.” On each of its eighteen days’ combat, myriads were slain; for\r\n“the father knew not the son, nor the disciple his preceptor.”\r\n\r\nVictory brought no happiness to Yudhishthira. The slaughter of his\r\nfriends disgusted him with the world, and he determined to withdraw from\r\nit; previously performing, at Hastinapura, funeral rites for Duryodhana\r\n(slain by the hands of Bhima), whose ambition and bad faith had\r\noriginated this exterminating war. “Having regained his kingdom, he\r\nproclaimed a new era, and placing on the throne of Indraprastha,\r\nParikshita, grandson to Arjuna, retired to Dwarka with Krishna and\r\nBaldeva: and since the war to the period of writing, 4636 years have\r\nelapsed.”[2.5.24]\r\n\r\nYudhishthira, Baldeva, and Krishna, having retired with the wreck of\r\nthis ill-fated struggle to Dwarka, the two former had soon to lament the\r\ndeath of Krishna, slain by one of the aboriginal tribes of Bhils;\r\nagainst whom, from their shattered condition, they were unable to\r\ncontend. After this event, Yudhishthira, with [51] Baldeva and a few\r\nfollowers, entirely withdrew from India, and emigrating northwards, by\r\nSind, to the Himalayan mountains, are there abandoned by Hindu\r\ntraditional history, and are supposed to have perished in the\r\nsnows.[2.5.25]\r\n\r\nFrom Parikshita, who succeeded Yudhishthira, to Vikramaditya,\r\nfour[2.5.26] dynasties are given in a continuous chain, exhibiting\r\nsixty-six princes to Rajpal, who, invading Kumaon, was slain by\r\nSukwanti. The Kumaun conqueror seized upon Delhi, but was soon\r\ndispossessed by Vikramaditya, who transferred the seat of imperial power\r\nfrom Indraprastha to Avanti, or Ujjain, from which time it became the\r\nfirst meridian of the Hindu astronomy.\r\n\r\nIndraprastha ceased to be a regal abode for eight centuries, when it was\r\nre-established by Anangpal,[2.5.27] the founder of the Tuar race,\r\nclaiming descent from the Pandus. Then the name of Delhi superseded that\r\nof Indraprastha.\r\n\r\n\"Sukwanti, a prince from the northern mountains of Kumaun, ruled\r\nfourteen [52] years, when he was slain by Vikramaditya;[2.5.28] and from\r\nthe Bharat to this period 2915 years have elapsed.\"[2.5.29]\r\n\r\nSuch a period asserted to have elapsed while sixty-six princes occupied\r\nthe throne, gives an average of forty-four years to each; which is\r\nincredible, if not absolutely impossible.\r\n\r\nIn another passage the compiler says: “I have read many books\r\n(shastras), and all agreed to make one hundred princes, all of\r\nKhatri[2.5.30] race, occupy the throne of Delhi from Yudhishthira to\r\nPrithwiraja, a period of 4100 years,[2.5.31] after which the\r\nRavad[2.5.32] race succeeded.”\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate for these remnants of historical data that they have\r\nonly extended the duration of reigns, and not added more heads.\r\nSixty-six links are quite sufficient to connect Yudhishthira and\r\nVikramaditya.\r\n\r\nWe cannot object to the “one hundred princes” who fill the space\r\nassigned from Yudhishthira to Prithwiraja, though there is no proportion\r\nbetween the number which precedes and that which follows Vikramaditya,\r\nthe former being sixty-six, the latter only thirty-four princes,\r\nalthough the period cannot differ half a century.\r\n\r\nLet us apply a test to these one hundred kings, from Yudhishthira to\r\nPrithwiraja: the result will be 2250 years.\r\n\r\nThis test is derived from the average rate of reigns of the chief\r\ndynasties of Rajasthan, during a period of 633[2.5.33] to 663[2.5.34]\r\nyears, or from Prithwiraja to the present date.\r\n\r\n       Of Mewar       34[2.5.35] princes, or 19 years to each\r\n                      reign.\r\n\r\n       Of Marwar      28   princes, or 23¼     ”        ”\r\n\r\n       Of Amber       29   princes, or 22½     ”        ”\r\n\r\n       Of Jaisalmer   28   princes, or 23¼     ”        ”\r\n\r\ngiving an average of twenty-two years for each reign [53].\r\n\r\nIt would not be proper to ascribe a longer period to each reign, and it\r\nwere perhaps better to give the minimum, nineteen, to extended\r\ndynasties; and to the sixty-six princes from Yudhishthira and\r\nVikramaditya not even so much, four revolutions[2.5.36] and usurpations\r\nmarking this period.\r\n\r\n=Jarasandha.=—The remaining line, that of Jarasandha, taken from the\r\nBhagavat, is of considerable importance, and will afford scope for\r\nfurther speculation.\r\n\r\nJarasandha was the monarch of Rajagriha,[2.5.37] or Bihar, whose son\r\nSahadeva, and grandson Marjari, are declared to have been contemporaries\r\nof the Mahabharata, and consequently coeval with Parikshita, the Delhi\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nThe direct line of Jarasandha terminates in twenty-three descents with\r\nRipunjaya, who was slain, and his throne assumed by his minister,\r\nSanaka, whose dynasty terminated in the fifth generation with\r\nNandivardandhana. Sanaka derived no personal advantage from his\r\nusurpation, as he immediately placed his son, Pradyota, on the throne.\r\nTo these five princes one hundred and thirty-eight years are assigned.\r\n\r\nA new race entered Hindustan, led by a conqueror termed Sheshnag, from\r\nSheshnagdesa,[2.5.38] who ascended the Pandu throne, and whose line\r\nterminates in ten descents with Mahanandin, of spurious birth. This last\r\nprince, who was also named Baikyat, carried on an exterminating warfare\r\nagainst the ancient Rajput princes of pure blood, the Puranas declaring\r\nthat since the dynasty of Sheshnag the princes were Sudras. Three\r\nhundred and sixty years are allotted to these ten princes.\r\n\r\n=Chandragupta Maurya.=—A fourth dynasty commenced with Chandragupta\r\nMaurya, of the same Takshak race.[2.5.39] The Maurya dynasty consisted\r\nof ten princes, who are stated to have passed away in one hundred and\r\nthirty-seven years. [322-185 B.C.]\r\n\r\n=Sunga, Kanva Dynasties.=—The fifth dynasty of eight princes were from\r\nSringides, and are said to have ruled one hundred and twelve years, when\r\na prince of Kanvades deprived the last of life and kingdom. Of these\r\neight princes, four were of pure blood, when Kistna, by a Sudra woman,\r\nsucceeded. The dynasty of Kanvades terminates in twenty-three\r\ngenerations with Susarman[2.5.40] [54].\r\n\r\n=Recapitulation.=—Thus from the Great War six successive dynasties are\r\ngiven, presenting a continuous chain of eighty-two princes, reckoning\r\nfrom Sahadeva, the successor of Jarasandha, to Susarman.\r\n\r\nTo some of the short dynasties periods are assigned of moderate length:\r\nbut as the first and last are without such data, the test already\r\ndecided on must be applied; which will yield 1704 years, being six\r\nhundred and four after Vikramaditya, whose contemporary will thus be\r\nBasdeva, the fifty-fifth prince from Sahadeva of the sixth dynasty, said\r\nto be a conqueror from the country of Katehr [or Rohilkhand]. If these\r\ncalculations possess any value, the genealogies of the Bhagavat are\r\nbrought down to the close of the fifth century following Vikramaditya.\r\nAs we cannot admit the gift of prophecy to the compilers of these books,\r\nwe may infer that they remodelled their ancient chronicles during the\r\nreign of Susarman, about the year of Vikrama 600, or A.D. 546.\r\n\r\nWith regard to calculations already adduced, as to the average number of\r\nyears for the reigns of the foregoing dynasties, a comparison with those\r\nwhich history affords of other parts of the world will supply the best\r\ncriterion of the correctness of the assumed data.\r\n\r\nFrom the revolt of the ten tribes against Rehoboam[2.5.41] to the\r\ncapture of Jerusalem, a period of three hundred and eighty-seven years,\r\ntwenty kings sat on the throne of Judah, making each reign nineteen and\r\na half years; but if we include the three anterior reigns of Saul,\r\nDavid, and Solomon, prior to the revolt, the result will be twenty-six\r\nand a half years each.\r\n\r\nFrom the dismemberment of the Assyrian[2.5.42] empire under\r\nSardanapalus, nearly nine hundred years before Christ, the three\r\nconsequent confluent dynasties of Babylonia, Assyria, and Media afford\r\nvery different results for comparison.\r\n\r\nThe Assyrian preserves the medium, while the Babylonish and Median run\r\ninto extremes. Of the nine princes who swayed Babylon, from the period\r\nof its separation from, till its reunion to Assyria, a space of\r\nfifty-two years, Darius, who ruled Media sixty [thirty-six] years [55],\r\noutlived the whole. Of the line of Darius there were but six princes,\r\nfrom the separation of the kingdoms to their reunion under Cyrus, a\r\nperiod of one hundred and seventy-four years, or twenty-nine to each\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nThe Assyrian reigns form a juster medium. From Nebuchadnezzar to\r\nSardanapalus we have twenty-two years to a reign; but from thence to the\r\nextinction of this dynasty, eighteen.\r\n\r\nThe first eleven kings, the Heraclidae of Lacedaemon, commencing with\r\nEurysthenes (1078 before Christ), average thirty-two years; while in\r\nrepublican Athens, nearly contemporary, from the first perpetual archon\r\nuntil the office became decennial in the seventh Olympiad, the reigns of\r\nthe twelve chief magistrates average twenty-eight years and a half.\r\n\r\nThus we have three periods, Jewish, Spartan, and Athenian, each\r\ncommencing about eleven hundred years before Christ, not half a century\r\nremote from the Mahabharata; with those of Babylonia, Assyria, and\r\nMedia, commencing where we quit the Grecian, in the eighth century\r\nbefore the Christian era, the Jewish ending in the sixth century.\r\n\r\nHowever short, compared with our Solar and Lunar dynasties, yet these,\r\ncombined with the average reigns of existing Hindu dynasties, will aid\r\nthe judgment in estimating the periods to be assigned to the lines thus\r\nafforded, instead of following the improbable value attached by the\r\nBrahmans.\r\n\r\nFrom such data, longevity appears in unison with climate and simplicity\r\nof life: the Spartan yielding the maximum of thirty-two to a reign,\r\nwhile the more luxurious Athens gives twenty-eight and a half. The Jews,\r\nfrom Saul to their exile “to the waters of Babylon,” twenty-six and a\r\nhalf. The Medes equal the Lacedaemonians, and in all history can only be\r\nparalleled by the princes of Anhilwara, one of whom, Chawand, almost\r\nequalled Darius.[2.5.43]\r\n\r\nOf the separated ten tribes, from the revolt to the captivity, twenty\r\nkings of Israel passed away in two centuries, or ten years each.\r\n\r\nThe Spartan and Assyrian present the extremes of thirty-two and\r\neighteen, giving a medium of twenty-five years to a reign.\r\n\r\nThe average result of our four Hindu dynasties, in a period of nearly\r\nseven hundred years, is twenty-two years.\r\n\r\nFrom all which data, I would presume to assign from twenty to twenty-two\r\nyears to each reign in lines of fifty princes [56].\r\n\r\nIf the value thus obtained be satisfactory, and the lines of dynasties\r\nderived from so many authorities correct, we shall arrive at the same\r\nconclusion with Mr. Bentley; who, by the more philosophical process of\r\nastronomical and genealogical combination, places Yudhishthira’s era in\r\nthe year 2825 of the world; which being taken from 4004 (the world’s age\r\nat the birth of Christ) will leave 1179 before Christ for Yudhishthira’s\r\nera, or 1123 before Vikramaditya.[2.5.44]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.5.1:\r\n\r\n  Indu, Som, Chandra, in Sanskrit ‘the moon’; hence the Lunar race is\r\n  termed the Chandravansa, Somvansa, or Induvansa, most probably the\r\n  root of _Hindu_.

When Mahadaji Sindhia was called by the Rana to\r\n  reduce a traitorous noble in Chitor, such was the reverence which\r\n  actuated that (in other respects) little scrupulous chieftain, that he\r\n  could not be prevailed on to point his cannon on the walls within\r\n  which consent established ‘the throne of Rama.’ The Rana himself, then\r\n  a youth, had to break the ice, and fired a cannon against his own\r\n  ancient abode.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.5.7:\r\n\r\n  Bryant, in his _Analysis_, mentions that the children of the Cushite\r\n  Ham used his name in salutation as a mark of recognition. ‘Ram, Ram,’\r\n  is the common salutation in these Hindu countries; the respondent\r\n  often joining Sita’s name with that of her consort Rama, ‘Sita Ram.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.5.8:\r\n\r\n  Twenty-eighth prince from Rama in Mr. Bentley’s list, and twenty-fifth\r\n  in mine.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.5.9:\r\n\r\n  Thirty-seventh in Mr. Bentley’s list and thirty-fourth in mine; but\r\n  the intervening names being made to follow Rama, Bahuman (written by\r\n  him _Banumat_) follows Takshak.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.5.10:\r\n\r\n  The period of time, also, would allow of their grafting the son of\r\n  Artaxerxes and father of Darius, the worshipper of Mithras, on the\r\n  stem of the adorers of Surya, while a curious notice of the Raja Jai\r\n  Singh’s on a subsequent name on this list which he calls Naushirwan,\r\n  strengthens the coincidence. Bahuman (see article ‘Bahaman,’\r\n  D’Herbelot’s _Bibl. Orient._) actually carried his arms into India,\r\n  and invaded the kingdoms of the Solar race of Mithila and Magadha. The\r\n  time is appropriate to the first Darius and his father; and Herodotus\r\n  [iii. 94] tells us that the richest and best of the satrapies of his\r\n  empire was the Hindu.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.5.11:\r\n\r\n  First lord.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.5.12:\r\n\r\n  Lord of the Bull.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.5.13:\r\n\r\n  Vidhyadhar was a Jain.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.5.14:\r\n\r\n  Pandu not being blessed with progeny, his queen made use of a charm by\r\n  which she enticed the deities from their spheres.

Amidst the snows of\r\n  Caucasus, Hindu legend abandons the Harikulas, under their leaders\r\n  Yudhishthira and Baldeva: yet if Alexander established his altars in\r\n  Panchala, amongst the sons of Puru and the Harikulas, what physical\r\n  impossibility exists that a colony of them, under Yudhishthira and\r\n  Baldeva, eight centuries anterior, should have penetrated to Greece?\r\n  Comparatively far advanced in science and arms, the conquest would\r\n  have been easy. When Alexander attacked the ‘free cities’ of Panchala,\r\n  the Purus and Harikulas who opposed him evinced the recollections of\r\n  their ancestor, in carrying the figure of Hercules as their standard.\r\n  Comparison proves a common origin to Hindu and Grecian mythology; and\r\n  Plato says the Greeks had theirs from Egypt and the East. May not this\r\n  colony of the Harikulas be the Heraclidae, who penetrated into the\r\n  Peloponnesus (according to Volney) 1078 years before Christ,\r\n  sufficiently near our calculated period of the Great War? The\r\n  Heraclidae claimed from Atreus: the Harikulas claim from Atri.\r\n  Eurysthenes was the first king of the Heraclidae: Yudhishthira has\r\n  sufficient affinity in name to the first Spartan king not to startle\r\n  the etymologist, the _d_ and _r_ being always permutable in Sanskrit.\r\n  The Greeks or Ionians are descended from Yavan, or Javan, the seventh\r\n  from Japhet. The Harikulas are also Yavans claiming from Javan or\r\n  Yavan, the thirteenth in descent from Yayati, the third son of the\r\n  primeval patriarch. The ancient Heraclidae of Greece asserted they\r\n  were as old as the sun, and older than the moon. May not this boast\r\n  conceal the fact that the Heliadae (or _Suryavansa_) of Greece had\r\n  settled there anterior to the colony of the Indu (Lunar) race of\r\n  Harikula? In all that relates to the mythological history of the\r\n  Indian demi-gods, Baldeva (Hercules), Krishna or Kanhaiya (Apollo),\r\n  and Budha (Mercury), a powerful and almost perfect resemblance can be\r\n  traced between those of Hindu legend, Greece, and Egypt. Baldeva (the\r\n  god of strength) Harikula, is still worshipped as in the days of\r\n  Alexander; his shrine at Baldeo in Vraj (the Surasenoi of the Greeks),\r\n  his club a ploughshare, and a lion’s skin his covering. A Hindu\r\n  intaglio of rare value represents Hercules exactly as described by\r\n  Arrian, with a monogram consisting of two ancient characters now\r\n  unknown, but which I have found wherever tradition assigns a spot to\r\n  the Harikulas; especially in Saurashtra, where they were long\r\n  concealed on their exile from Delhi. This we may at once decide to be\r\n  the exact figure of Hercules which Arrian describes his descendants to\r\n  have carried as their standard, when Porus opposed Alexander. The\r\n  intaglio will appear in the _Trans. R.A.S._ [The speculations in this\r\n  note have no authority.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.5.26:\r\n\r\n  The twenty-eighth prince, Khemraj, was the last in lineal descent from\r\n  Parikshita, the grand-nephew of Yudhishthira.

His son was Aghuz,[2.6.1]\r\nthe founder of all the races of those northern regions, called Tatars\r\nand Mogol [57]. Aghuz had six sons.[2.6.2] First, Kun,[2.6.3] ‘the sun,’\r\nthe Surya of the Puranas; secondly, Ai,[2.6.4] ‘the moon,’ the Indu of\r\nthe Puranas. In the latter, Ai, we have even the same name [Ayus] as in\r\nthe Puranas for the Lunar ancestor. The Tatars all claim from Ai, ‘the\r\nmoon,’ the Indus of the Puranas. Hence with them, as with the German\r\ntribes, the moon was always a male deity. The Tatar Ai had a son,\r\nYulduz. His son was Hyu, from whom[2.6.5] came the first race of the\r\nkings of China. The Puranic Ayus had a son, Yadu (pronounced Jadon);\r\nfrom whose third son, Haya, the Hindu genealogist deduces no line, and\r\nfrom whom the Chinese may claim their Indu[2.6.5] origin. Il Khan (ninth\r\nfrom Ai) had two sons: first, Kian; and secondly, Nagas; whose\r\ndescendants peopled all Tatary. From Kian, Jenghiz Khan claimed\r\ndescent.[2.6.6] Nagas was probably the founder of the Takshak, or Snake\r\nrace[2.6.7] of the Puranas and Tatar genealogists, the Tak-i-uk Moguls\r\nof De Guignes.\r\n\r\nSuch are the comparative genealogical origins of the three races. Let us\r\ncompare their theogony, the fabulous birth assigned by each for the\r\nfounder of the Indu race.\r\n\r\n=Mongol and Hindu Traditions.=—1. The Puranic. “Ila (_the earth_),\r\ndaughter of the sun-born Ikshwaku, while wandering in the forests was\r\nencountered by Budha (_Mercury_), and from the rape of Ila sprung the\r\nIndu race.”\r\n\r\n2. The Chinese account of the birth of Yu (Ayu), their first monarch. “A\r\nstar[2.6.8] (Mercury or Fo) struck his mother while journeying. She\r\nconceived, and gave to the world Yu, the founder of the first dynasty\r\nwhich reigned in China. Yu divided China into nine provinces, and began\r\nto reign 2207[2.6.9] years before Christ” [58].\r\n\r\nThus the Ai of the Tatars, the Yu of the Chinese, and the Ayus of the\r\nPuranas, evidently indicate the great Indu (Lunar) progenitor of the\r\nthree races. Budha (Mercury), the son of Indu (the moon), became the\r\npatriarchal and spiritual leader; as Fo, in China; Woden and\r\nTeutates,[2.6.10] of the tribes migrating to Europe. Hence it follows\r\nthat the religion of Buddha must be coeval with the existence of these\r\nnations; that it was brought into India Proper by them, and guided them\r\nuntil the schism of Krishna and the Suryas, worshippers of Bal, in time\r\ndepressed them, when the Buddha religion was modified into its present\r\nmild form, the Jain.[2.6.11]\r\n\r\n=Scythian Traditions.=—Let us contrast with these the origin of the\r\nScythic nations, as related by Diodorus;[2.6.12] when it will be\r\nobserved the same legends were known to him which have been handed down\r\nby the Puranas and Abulghazi.\r\n\r\n\"The Scythians had their first abodes on the Araxes.[2.6.13] Their\r\norigin was from a virgin born of the earth[2.6.14] of the shape of a\r\nwoman from the waist upwards, and below a serpent (symbol of Budha or\r\nMercury); that Jupiter had a son by her, named Scythes,[2.6.15] whose\r\nname the nation adopted. Scythes had two sons, Palas and Napas (_qu._\r\nthe Nagas, or Snake race, of the Tatar genealogy?), who were celebrated\r\nfor their great actions, and who divided the countries; and the nations\r\nwere called after them, the Palians (_qu._ Pali?)[2.6.16] and Napians.\r\nThey led their forces as far as the Nile on Egypt, and subdued many\r\nnations. They enlarged the empire of the Scythians as far as the Eastern\r\nocean, and to the Caspian and lake Moeotis. The nation had many kings,\r\nfrom whom the Sacans (_Sakae_), the Massagetae (_Getae_ or _Jats_), the\r\nAri-aspians (_Aswas_ of Aria), and many other races. They overran\r\nAssyria and Media[2.6.17] [59], overturning the empire, and\r\ntransplanting the inhabitants to the Araxes under the name of\r\nSauro-Matians.\"[2.6.18]\r\n\r\nAs the Sakae, Getae, Aswa, and Takshak are names which have crept in\r\namongst our thirty-six royal races, common with others also to early\r\ncivilization in Europe, let us seek further ancient authority on the\r\noriginal abodes.\r\n\r\nStrabo[2.6.19] says: \"All the tribes east of the Caspian are called\r\nScythic. The Dahae[2.6.20] next the sea, the Massagetae (_great_ Gete)\r\nand Sakae more eastward; but every tribe has a particular name. All are\r\nnomadic: but of these nomads the best-known are the Asii,[2.6.21] the\r\nPasiani, Tochari, Sacarauli, who took Bactria from the Greeks. The\r\nSakae[2.6.22] (‘races’) have made in Asia irruptions similar to those of\r\nthe Cimmerians; thus they have been seen to possess themselves of\r\nBactria, and the best district of Armenia, called after them\r\nSakasenae.\"[2.6.23]\r\n\r\nWhich of the tribes of Rajasthan are the offspring of the Aswa and\r\nMedes, of Indu race, returned under new appellations, we shall not now\r\nstop to inquire, limiting our hypothesis to the fact of invasions, and\r\nadducing some evidence of such being simultaneous with migrations of the\r\nsame bands into Europe. Hence the inference of a common origin between\r\nthe Rajput and early races of Europe; to support which, a similar\r\nmythology, martial manners and poetry, language, and even music and\r\narchitectural ornaments, may be adduced.[2.6.24]\r\n\r\nOf the first migrations of the Indu-Scythic Getae, Takshak, and Asii,\r\ninto India, that of Sheshnag (Takshak), from Sheshnagdes (Tocharistan?)\r\nor Sheshnag, six centuries, by calculation, before Christ, is the first\r\nnoticed by the Puranas.[2.6.25] About this period a grand irruption of\r\nthe same races conquered Asia Minor, and [60] eventually Scandinavia;\r\nand not long after the Asii and Tochari overturned the Greek kingdom of\r\nBactria, the Romans felt the power of the Asi,[2.6.26] the Chatti, and\r\nCimbri, from the Baltic shore.\r\n\r\n“If we can show the Germans to have been originally Scythae or Goths\r\n(Getes or Jits), a wide field of curiosity and inquiry is open to the\r\norigin of government, manners, etc.; all the antiquities of Europe will\r\nassume a new appearance, and, instead of being traced to the bands of\r\nGermany, as Montesquieu and the greatest writers have hitherto done, may\r\nbe followed through long descriptions of the manners of the Scythians,\r\netc., as given by Herodotus. Scandinavia was occupied by the Scythae\r\nfive hundred years before Christ. These Scythians worshipped Mercury\r\n(Budha), Woden or Odin, and believed themselves his progeny. The Gothic\r\nmythology, by parallel, might be shown to be Grecian, whose gods were\r\nthe progeny of Coelus and Terra (Budha and Ella).[2.6.27] Dryads,\r\nsatyrs, fairies, and all the Greek and Roman superstition, may be found\r\nin the Scandinavian creed. The Goths consulted the heart of victims, had\r\noracles, had sibyls, had a Venus in Freya, and Parcae in the\r\nValkyrie.”[2.6.28]\r\n\r\n=The Scythian Descent of the Rajputs.=—Ere we proceed to trace these\r\nmythological resemblances, let us adduce further opinions in proof of\r\nthe position assumed of a common origin of the tribes of early Europe\r\nand the Scythic Rajput.\r\n\r\nThe translator of Abulghazi, in his preface, observes: \"Our contempt for\r\nthe Tatars would lessen did we consider how nearly we stand related to\r\nthem, and that our ancestors originally came from the north of Asia, and\r\nthat our customs, laws, and way of living were formerly the same as\r\ntheirs. In short, that we are no other than a colony of Tatars.\r\n\r\n\"It was from Tatary those people came, who, under the successive names\r\nof Cymbrians,[2.6.29] Kelts, and Gauls, possessed all the northern part\r\nof Europe. What were the Goths, Huns, Alans, Swedes, Vandals, Franks,\r\nbut swarms of the same hive? The Swedish chronicles bring the\r\nSwedes[2.6.30] from Cashgar, and [61] the affinity between the Saxon\r\nlanguage and Kipchak is great; and the Keltick language still subsisting\r\nin Britany and Wales is a demonstration that the inhabitants are\r\ndescended from Tatar nations.\"\r\n\r\nFrom between the parallels of 30° and 50° of north latitude, and from\r\n75° to 95° of east longitude, the highlands of Central Asia, alike\r\nremoved from the fires of the equator and the cold of the arctic circle,\r\nmigrated the races which passed into Europe and within the Indus. We\r\nmust therefore voyage up the Indus, cross the Paropanisos, to the Oxus\r\nor Jihun, to Sakatai[2.6.31] or Sakadwipa, and from thence and the\r\nDasht-i Kipchak conduct the Takshaks, the Getae, the Kamari, the Chatti,\r\nand the Huns, into the plains of Hindustan.\r\n\r\nWe have much to learn in these unexplored regions, the abode of ancient\r\ncivilisation, and which, so late as Jenghiz Khan’s invasion, abounded\r\nwith large cities. It is an error to suppose that the nations of Higher\r\nAsia were merely pastoral; and De Guignes, from original authorities,\r\ninforms us that when the Su invaded the Yueh-chi or Jats, they found\r\nupwards of a hundred cities containing the merchandise of India, and\r\nwith the currency bearing the effigies of the prince.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of Central Asia long before the Christian era, though\r\nnow depopulated and rendered desert by desolating wars, which have raged\r\nin these countries, and to which Europe can exhibit no parallel. Timur’s\r\nwars, in more modern times, against the Getic nation, will illustrate\r\nthe paths of his ambitious predecessors in the career of destruction.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the political limits of the great Getic nation in the time\r\nof Cyrus, six centuries before Christ, we shall find them little\r\ncircumscribed in power on the rise of Timur, though twenty centuries had\r\nelapsed [62].\r\n\r\n=Jāts and Getae.=—At this period (A.D. 1330), under the last prince of\r\nGetic race, Tughlak Timur Khan, the kingdom of Chagatai[2.6.32] was\r\nbounded on the west by the Dasht-i Kipchak, and on the south by the\r\nJihun, on which river the Getic Khan, like Tomyris, had his capital.\r\nKokhand, Tashkent, Utrar,[2.6.33] Cyropolis, and the most northern of\r\nthe Alexandrias, were within the bounds of Chagatai.\r\n\r\nThe Getae, Jut, or Jat, and Takshak races, which occupy places amongst\r\nthe thirty-six royal races of India, are all from the region of Sakatai.\r\nRegarding their earliest migrations, we shall endeavour to make the\r\nPuranas contribute; but of their invasions in more modern times the\r\nhistories of Mahmud of Ghazni, and Timur abundantly acquaint us.\r\n\r\nFrom the mountains of Jud[2.6.34] to the shores of Makran,[2.6.35] and\r\nalong the Ganges, the Jat is widely spread; while the Takshak name is\r\nnow confined to inscriptions or old writings.\r\n\r\nInquiries in their original haunts, and among tribes now under different\r\nnames, might doubtless bring to light their original designation, now\r\nbest known within the Indus; while the Takshak or Takiuk may probably be\r\ndiscovered in the Tajik, still in his ancient haunts, the Transoxiana\r\nand Chorasmia of classic authors; the Mawaru-n-nahr of the Persians; the\r\nTuran, Turkistan, or Tocharistan of native geography; the abode of the\r\nTochari, Takshak, or Turushka invaders of India, described in the\r\nPuranas and existing inscriptions.\r\n\r\nThe Getae had long maintained their independence when Tomyris defended\r\ntheir liberty against Cyrus. Driven in successive wars across the\r\nSutlej, we shall elsewhere show them preserving their ancient habits, as\r\ndesultory cavaliers, under the Jat leader of Lahore, in pastoral\r\ncommunities in Bikaner, the Indian desert and elsewhere, though they\r\nhave lost sight of their early history. The transition from pastoral to\r\nagricultural pursuits is but short, and the descendant of the nomadic\r\nGetae of Transoxiana is now the best husbandman on the plains of\r\nHindustan[2.6.36] [63].\r\n\r\nThe invasion of these Indu-Scythic tribes, Getae, Takshaks, Asii,\r\nChatti, Rajpali,[2.6.37] Huns, Kamari, introduced the worship of Budha,\r\nthe founder of the Indu or Lunar race.\r\n\r\nHerodotus says the Getae were theists,[2.6.38] and held the tenets of\r\nthe soul’s immortality; so with the Buddhists.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, touching on points of religious resemblance between the\r\nAsii, Getae, or Jut of Scandinavia (who gave his name to the Cimbric\r\nChersonese) and the Getae of Scythia and India, let us make a few\r\nremarks on the Asii or Aswa.\r\n\r\n=The Aswa.=—To the Indu race of Aswa (the descendants of Dvimidha and\r\nBajaswa), spread over the countries on both sides the Indus, do we\r\nprobably owe the distinctive appellation of Asia. Herodotus[2.6.39] says\r\nthe Greeks denominated Asia from the wife of Prometheus; while others\r\ndeduce it from a grandson of Manes, indicating the Aswa descendants of\r\nthe patriarch Manu. Asa,[2.6.40] Sakambhari,[2.6.41] Mata,[2.6.42] is\r\nthe divinity Hope, ‘mother-protectress of the Sakha,’ or races. Every\r\nRajput adores Asapurna, ‘the fulfiller of desire’; or, as Sakambhari\r\nDevi (goddess protectress), she is invoked previous to any undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe Aswas were chiefly of the Indu race; yet a branch of the Suryas also\r\nbore this designation. It appears to indicate their celebrity as\r\nhorsemen.[2.6.43] All of them worshipped the horse, which they\r\nsacrificed to the sun. This grand rite, the Asvamedha, on the festival\r\nof the winter solstice, would alone go far to exemplify their common\r\nScythic origin with the Getic Saka, authorising the inference of\r\nPinkerton, “that a grand Scythic nation extended from the Caspian to the\r\nGanges.”\r\n\r\n=The Asvamedha.=—The Asvamedha was practised on the Ganges and Sarju by\r\nthe Solar princes [64], twelve hundred years before Christ, as by the\r\nGetae in the time of Cyrus; “deeming it right,” says Herodotus [i. 216]\r\n“to offer the swiftest of created to the chief of uncreated beings”: and\r\nthis worship and sacrifice of the horse has been handed down to the\r\nRajput of the present day. A description of this grand ceremony shall\r\nclose these analogies.\r\n\r\nThe Getic Asii carried this veneration for the steed, symbolic of their\r\nchief deity the sun, into Scandinavia: equally so of all the early\r\nGerman tribes, the Su, Suevi, Chatti, Sucimbri, Getae, in the forests of\r\nGermany, and on the banks of the Elbe and Weser. The milk-white steed\r\nwas supposed to be the organ of the gods, from whose neighing they\r\ncalculated future events; notions possessed also by the Aswa, sons of\r\nBudha (Woden), on the Yamuna and Ganges, when the rocks of Scandinavia\r\nand the shores of the Baltic were yet untrod by man. It was this omen\r\nwhich gave Darius Hystaspes[2.6.44] (_hinsna_, ‘to neigh,’ _aspa_, ‘a\r\nhorse’) a crown. The bard Chand makes it the omen of death to his\r\nprincipal heroes. The steed of the Scandinavian god of battle was kept\r\nin the temple of Upsala, and always “found foaming and sweating after\r\nbattle.” “Money,” says Tacitus, “was only acceptable to the German when\r\nbearing the effigies of the horse.”[2.6.45]\r\n\r\nIn the Edda we are informed that the Getae, or Jats, who entered\r\nScandinavia, were termed Asi, and their first settlement\r\nAs-gard.[2.6.46]\r\n\r\nPinkerton rejects the authority of the Edda and follows Torfaeus, who\r\n“from Icelandic chronicles and genealogies concludes Odin to have come\r\ninto Scandinavia in the time of Darius Hystaspes, five hundred years\r\nbefore Christ.”\r\n\r\nThis is the period of the last Buddha, or Mahavira, whose era is four\r\nhundred and seventy-seven years before Vikrama, or five hundred and\r\nthirty-three before Christ.\r\n\r\nThe successor of Odin in Scandinavia was Gotama; and Gautama was the\r\nsuccessor of the last Buddha, Mahavira,[2.6.47] who as Gotama, or\r\nGaudama, is still adored from the Straits of Malacca to the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\n“Other antiquaries,” says Pinkerton, “assert another Odin, who was put\r\nas the supreme deity one thousand years before Christ” [65].\r\n\r\nMallet admits two Odins, but Mr. Pinkerton wishes he had abided by that\r\nof Torfaeus, in 500 A.C.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that the periods of both the Scandinavian Odins\r\nshould assimilate with the twenty-second Buddha [Jain Tirthakara],\r\nNeminath, and twenty-fourth and last, Mahavira; the first the\r\ncontemporary of Krishna, about 1000 or 1100 years, the last 533, before\r\nChrist. The Asii, Getae, etc., of Europe worshipped Mercury as founder\r\nof their line, as did the Eastern Asi, Takshaks, and Getae. The Chinese\r\nand Tatar historians also say Buddha, or Fo, appeared 1027 years before\r\nChrist. “The Yuchi, established in Bactria and along the Jihun,\r\neventually bore the name of Jeta or Yetan,[2.6.48] that is to say,\r\nGetae. Their empire subsisted a long time in this part of Asia, and\r\nextended even into India. These are the people whom the Greeks knew\r\nunder the name of Indo-Scythes. Their manners are the same as those of\r\nthe Turks.[2.6.49] Revolutions occurred in the very heart of the East,\r\nwhose consequences were felt afar.”[2.6.50]\r\n\r\nThe period allowed by all these authorities for the migration of these\r\nScythic hordes into Europe is also that for their entry into India.\r\n\r\nThe sixth century is that calculated for the Takshak from Sheshnagdesa;\r\nand it is on this event and reign that the Puranas declare, that from\r\nthis period “no prince of pure blood would be found, but that the Sudra,\r\nthe Turushka, and the Yavan, would prevail.”\r\n\r\nAll these Indu-Scythic invaders held the religion of Buddha: and hence\r\nthe conformity of manners and mythology between the Scandinavian or\r\nGerman tribes and the Rajputs increased by comparing their martial\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nSimilarity of religious manners affords stronger proofs of original\r\nidentity than language. Language is eternally changing—so are manners;\r\nbut an exploded custom or rite traced to its source, and maintained in\r\nopposition to climate, is a testimony not to be rejected.\r\n\r\n=Personal Habits, Dress.=—When Tacitus informs us that the first act of\r\na German on rising was ablution, it will be conceded this habit was not\r\nacquired in [66] the cold climate of Germany, but must have been of\r\neastern[2.6.51] origin; as were “the loose flowing robe; the long and\r\nbraided hair, tied in a knot at the top of the head”; with many other\r\ncustoms, personal habits, and superstitions of the Scythic Cimbri, Juts,\r\nChatti, Suevi, analogous to the Getic nations of the same name, as\r\ndescribed by Herodotus, Justin, and Strabo, and which yet obtain amongst\r\nthe Rajput Sakhae of the present day.\r\n\r\nLet us contrast what history affords of resemblance in religion or\r\nmanners. First, as to religion.\r\n\r\n=Theogony.=—Tuisto (Mercury) and Ertha (the earth) were the chief\r\ndivinities of the early German tribes. Tuisto[2.6.52] was born of the\r\nEarth (Ila) and Manus (Manu). He is often confounded with Odin, or\r\nWoden, the Budha of the eastern tribes, though they are the Mars and\r\nMercury of these nations.\r\n\r\n=Religious Rites.=—The Suiones or Suevi, the most powerful Getic nation\r\nof Scandinavia, were divided into many tribes, one of whom, the Su\r\n(Yueh-chi or Jat), made human sacrifices in their consecrated\r\ngroves[2.6.53] to Ertha (Ila), whom all worshipped, and whose chariot\r\nwas drawn by a cow.[2.6.54] The Suevi worshipped Isis (Isa, Gauri, the\r\nIsis and Ceres of Rajasthan), in whose rites the figure of a ship is\r\nintroduced; “symbolic,” observes Tacitus, “of its foreign\r\norigin.”[2.6.55] The festival of Isa, or Gauri, wife of Iswara, at\r\nUdaipur, is performed on the lake, and appears to be exactly that of\r\nIsis and Osiris in Egypt, as described by Herodotus. On this occasion\r\nIswara (Osiris), who is secondary to his wife, has a stalk of the onion\r\nin blossom in his hand; a root detested by the Hindus generally, though\r\nadored by the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n=Customs of War.=—They sung hymns in praise of Hercules, as well as\r\nTuisto or Odin, whose banners and images they carried to the field; and\r\nfought in clans, using the feram or javelin, both in close and distant\r\ncombat. In all maintaining [67] the resemblance to the Harikula,\r\ndescendants of Budha, and the Aswa, offspring of Bajaswa, who peopled\r\nthose regions west of the Indus, and whose redundant population spread\r\nboth east and west.\r\n\r\nThe Suevi, or Suiones, erected the celebrated temple of Upsala, in which\r\nthey placed the statues of Thor, Woden, and Freya, the triple divinity\r\nof the Scandinavian Asii, the Trimurti of the Solar and Lunar races. The\r\nfirst (Thor, the thunderer, or god of war) is Hara, or Mahadeva, the\r\ndestroyer; the second (Woden) is Budha,[2.6.56] the preserver; and the\r\nthird (Freya) is Uma, the creative power.\r\n\r\nThe grand festival to Freya was in spring, when all nature revived; then\r\nboars were offered to her by the Scandinavians, and even boars of paste\r\nwere made and swallowed by the peasantry.\r\n\r\nAs Vasanti, or spring personified, the consort of Hara is worshipped by\r\nthe Rajput, who opens the season with a grand hunt,[2.6.57] led by the\r\nprince and his vassal chiefs, when they chase, slay, and eat the boar.\r\nPersonal danger is disregarded on this day, as want of success is\r\nominous that the Great Mother will refuse all petitions throughout the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nPinkerton, quoting Ptolemy (who was fifty years after Tacitus), says\r\nthere were six nations in Yeutland or Jutland, the country of the Juts,\r\nof whom were the Sablingii (Suevi,[2.6.58] or Suiones), the Chatti and\r\nHermandri, who extended to the estuary of the Elbe and Weser. There they\r\nerected the pillar Irmansul to “the god of war,” regarding which\r\nSammes[2.6.59] observes: “some will have it to be Mars his pillar,\r\nothers Hermes Saul, or the pillar of Hermes or Mercury”; and he\r\nnaturally asks, “how did the Saxons come to be acquainted with the Greek\r\nname of Mercury?”\r\n\r\nSacrificial pillars are termed _Sula_ in Sanskrit; which, conjoined with\r\nHara,[2.6.60] the Indian god of war, would be Harsula. The Rajput\r\nwarrior invokes Hara with his trident (trisula) to help him in battle,\r\nwhile his battle-shout is ‘mar! mar!’ The Cimbri, one of the most\r\ncelebrated of the six tribes of Yeutland, derive their name from their\r\nfame as warriors [68].[2.6.61]\r\n\r\nKumara[2.6.62] is the Rajput god of war. He is represented with seven\r\nheads in the Hindu mythology: the Saxon god of war has six.[2.6.63] The\r\nsix-headed Mars of the Cimbri Chersonese, to whom was raised the\r\nIrmansul on the Weser, was worshipped by the Sakasenae, the Chatti, the\r\nSiebi or Suevi, the Jotae or Getae, and the Cimbri, evincing in name, as\r\nin religious rites, a common origin with the martial warriors of\r\nHindustan.\r\n\r\n=Rajput Religion.=—The religion of the martial Rajput, and the rites of\r\nHara, the god of battle, are little analogous to those of the meek\r\nHindus, the followers of the pastoral divinity, the worshippers of kine,\r\nand feeders on fruits, herbs, and water. The Rajput delights in blood:\r\nhis offerings to the god of battle are sanguinary, blood and wine. The\r\ncup (kharpara) of libation is the human skull. He loves them because\r\nthey are emblematic of the deity he worships; and he is taught to\r\nbelieve that Hara loves them, who in war is represented with the skull\r\nto drink the foeman’s blood, and in peace is the patron of wine and\r\nwomen. With Parbati on his knee, his eyes rolling from the juice of the\r\nphul (ardent spirits) and opium, such is this Bacchanalian divinity of\r\nwar. Is this Hinduism, acquired on the burning plains of India? Is it\r\nnot rather a perfect picture of the manners of the Scandinavian heroes?\r\n\r\nThe Rajput slays buffaloes, hunts and eats the boar and deer, and shoots\r\nducks and wild fowl (_kukkut_); he worships his horse, his sword, and\r\nthe sun, and attends more to the martial song of the bard than to the\r\nlitany of the Brahman. In the martial mythology and warlike poetry of\r\nthe Scandinavians a wide field exists for assimilation, and a comparison\r\nof the poetical remains of the Asi of the east and west would alone\r\nsuffice to suggest a common origin.\r\n\r\n=Bards.=—In the sacred Bardai of the Rajput we have the bard of our\r\nSaxon ancestry; those reciters of warlike poetry, of whom Tacitus says,\r\n“with their barbarous strains, they influence their minds in the day of\r\nbattle with a chorus of military virtue.”\r\n\r\nA comparison, in so extensive a field, would include the whole of their\r\nmanners and religious opinions, and must be reserved for a distinct\r\nwork.[2.6.64] The Valkyrie [69], or fatal sisters of the Suevi or Siebi,\r\nwould be the twin sisters of the Apsaras, who summon the Rajput warrior\r\nfrom the field of battle, and bear him to “the mansion of the sun,”\r\nequally the object of attainment with the children of Odin in\r\nScandinavia, and of Budha and Surya in the plains of Scythia and on the\r\nGanges, like the Elysium[2.6.65] of the Heliadae of Greece.\r\n\r\nIn the day of battle we should see in each the same excitements to glory\r\nand contempt of death, and the _dramatis personae_ of the field, both\r\ncelestial and terrestrial, move and act alike. We should see Thor, the\r\nthunderer, leading the Siebi, and Hara (Siva) the Indian Jove, his own\r\nworshippers (Sivseva); in which Freya, or Bhavani, and even the\r\npreserver (Krishna) himself, not unfrequently mingle.\r\n\r\n=War Chariots.=—The war chariot is peculiar to the Indu-Scythic nations,\r\nfrom Dasaratha,[2.6.66] and the heroes of the Mahabharata, to the\r\nconquest of Hindustan by the Muhammadans, when it was laid aside. On the\r\nplains of Kurukshetra, Krishna became charioteer to his friend Arjun;\r\nand the Getic hordes of the Jaxartes, when they aided Xerxes in Greece,\r\nand Darius on the plains of Arbela,[2.6.67] had their chief strength in\r\nthe war chariot.\r\n\r\nThe war chariot continued to be used later in the south-west of India\r\nthan elsewhere, and the Kathi,[2.6.68] Khuman, Kumari of Saurashtra have\r\nto recent times retained their Scythic habits, as their monumental\r\nstones testify, expressing their being slain from their cars [70].\r\n\r\n=Position of Women.=—In no point does resemblance more attach between\r\nthe ancient German and Scandinavian tribes, and the martial Rajput or\r\nancient Getae, than in their delicacy towards females.\r\n\r\n“The Germans,” says Tacitus [_Germania_, viii.], “deemed the advice of a\r\nwoman in periods of exigence oracular.” So does the Rajput, as the bard\r\nChand often exemplifies; and hence they append to her name the epithet\r\n_Devi_ (or contracted _De_), ‘god-like.’ “To a German mind,” says\r\nTacitus, “the idea of a woman led into captivity is insupportable”; and\r\nto prevent this the Rajput raises the poignard against the heart which\r\nbeats only for him, though never to survive the dire necessity. It is\r\nthen they perform the sacrifice ‘johar,’ when every sakha (branch) is\r\ncut off: and hence the Rajput glories in the title of _Sakha-band_, from\r\nhaving performed the sakha; an awful rite, and with every appearance of\r\nbeing the _sacaea_ of the Scythic Getae, as described by Strabo.[2.6.69]\r\n\r\n=Gaming.=—In passion for play at games of chance, its extent and dire\r\nconsequences, the Rajput, from the earliest times, has evinced a\r\npredilection, and will stand comparison with the Scythian and his German\r\noffspring. The German staked his personal liberty, became a slave, and\r\nwas sold as the property of the winner. To this vice the Pandavas owed\r\nthe loss of their sovereignty and personal liberty, involving at last\r\nthe destruction of all the Indu [71] races; nor has the passion abated.\r\nReligion even consecrates the vice; and once a year, on ‘the Festival of\r\nLamps’ (_Diwali_), all propitiate the goddess of wealth and fortune\r\n(Lakshmi) by offering at her shrine.\r\n\r\nDestitute of mental pursuits, the martial Rajput is often slothful or\r\nattached to sensual pleasures, and when roused, reckless on what he may\r\nwreak a fit of energy. Yet when order and discipline prevail in a\r\nwealthy chieftainship, there is much of that patriarchal mode of life,\r\nwith its amusements, alike suited to the Rajput, the Getae of the Jihun,\r\nor Scandinavian.\r\n\r\n=Omens, Auguries.=—Divination by lots, auguries, and omens by flights of\r\nbirds, as practised by the Getic nations described by Herodotus, and\r\namongst the Germans by Tacitus, will be found amongst the Rajputs, from\r\nwhose works[2.6.70] on this subject might have been supplied the whole\r\nof the Augurs and Aruspices, German or Roman.\r\n\r\n=Love of Strong Drink.=—Love of liquor, and indulgence in it to excess,\r\nwere deep-rooted in the Scandinavian Asi and German tribes, and in which\r\nthey showed their Getic origin; nor is the Rajput behind his brethren\r\neither of Scythia or Europe. It is the free use of this and similar\r\nindulgences, prohibited by ordinances which govern the ordinary Hindu,\r\nthat first induced me to believe that these warlike races were little\r\nindebted to India.\r\n\r\nThe Rajput welcomes his guest with the _munawwar piyala_, or ‘cup of\r\nrequest,’ in which they drown ancient enmities. The heroes of Odin never\r\nrelished a cup of mead more than the Rajput his _madhu_;[2.6.71] and the\r\nbards of Scandinavia and Rajwara are alike eloquent in the praise of the\r\nbowl, on which the Bardai exhausts every metaphor, and calls it\r\nambrosial, immortal.[2.6.72] “The bard, as he sipped the ambrosia, in\r\nwhich sparkled the ruby seed of the pomegranate, rehearsed the glory of\r\nthe race of the fearless.[2.6.73] May the king live for ever, alike\r\nbounteous in gifts to the bard and the foe!” Even in the heaven of\r\nIndra, the Hindu warrior’s paradise, akin to Valhalla [72], the Rajput\r\nhas his cup, which is served by the Apsaras, the twin sister of the\r\ncelestial Hebe of Scania. “I shall quaff full goblets amongst the gods,”\r\nsays the dying Getic warrior;[2.6.74] “I die laughing”: sentiments which\r\nwould be appreciated by a Rajput.\r\n\r\nA Rajput inebriated is a rare sight: but a more destructive and recent\r\nvice has usurped much of the honours of the ‘invitation cup,’ which has\r\nbeen degraded from the pure ‘flower’[2.6.75] to an infusion of the\r\npoppy, destructive of every quality. Of this pernicious habit we may use\r\nthe words which the historian of German manners applies to the tribes of\r\nthe Weser and Elbe, in respect to their love of strong drink: “Indulge\r\nit, and you need not employ the terror of your arms; their own vices\r\nwill subdue them.”\r\n\r\nThe cup of the Scandinavian worshippers of Thor, the god of battle, was\r\na human skull, that of the foe, in which they showed their thirst of\r\nblood; also borrowed from the chief of the Hindu Triad, Hara, the god of\r\nbattle, who leads his heroes in the ‘red field of slaughter’ with the\r\n_khopra_[2.6.76] in his hand, with which he gorges on the blood of the\r\nslain.\r\n\r\nHara is the patron of all who love war and strong drink, and is\r\nespecially the object of the Rajput warrior’s devotion: accordingly\r\nblood and wine form the chief oblations to the great god of the Indus.\r\nThe Gosains,[2.6.77] the peculiar priests of Hara, or Bal, the sun, all\r\nindulge in intoxicating drugs, herbs, and drinks. Seated on their lion,\r\nleopard, or deer skins, their bodies covered with ashes, their hair\r\nmatted and braided, with iron tongs to feed the penitential fires, their\r\nsavage appearance makes them fit organs for the commands of the blood\r\nand slaughter. Contrary, likewise, to general practice, the minister of\r\nHara, the god of war, at his death is committed to the earth, and a\r\ncircular tumulus is raised over him; and with some classes of Gosains,\r\nsmall tumuli, whose form is the frustrum of a cone, with lateral steps,\r\nthe apex crowned with a cylindrical stone [73].[2.6.78]\r\n\r\n=Funeral Ceremonies.=—In the last rites for the dead, comparison will\r\nyield proofs of original similarity. The funeral ceremonies of\r\nScandinavia have distinguished the national eras, and the ‘age of fire’\r\nand ‘the age of hills,’[2.6.79] designated the periods when the warrior\r\nwas committed to mother earth or consumed on the pyre.\r\n\r\nOdin (Budha) introduced the latter custom, and the raising of tumuli\r\nover the ashes when the body was burned; as also the practice of the\r\nwife burning with her deceased lord. These manners were carried from\r\nSakadwipa, or Saka Scythia, “where the Geta,” says Herodotus [v. 5],\r\n“was consumed on the pyre or burned alive with her lord.” With the\r\nGetae, the Siebi or Suevi of Scandinavia, if the deceased had more than\r\none wife, the elder claimed the privilege of burning.[2.6.80] Thus,\r\n“Nanna was consumed in the same fire with the body of her husband,\r\nBalder, one of Odin’s companions.” But the Scandinavians were anxious to\r\nforget this mark of their Asiatic origin, and were not always willing to\r\nburn, or to make “so cruel and absurd a sacrifice to the manes of their\r\nhusbands, the idea of which had been picked up by their Scythian\r\nancestors, when they inhabited the warmer climates of Asia, where they\r\nhad their first abodes.”[2.6.81]\r\n\r\n“The Scythic Geta,” says Herodotus [iv. 71], “had his horse sacrificed\r\non his funeral pyre; and the Scandinavian Geta had his horse and arms\r\nburied with him, as they could not approach Odin on foot.”[2.6.82] The\r\nRajput warrior is carried to his final abode armed at all points as when\r\nalive, his shield on his back and brand in hand; while his steed, though\r\nnot sacrificed, is often presented to the deity, and becomes a\r\nperquisite of the priest.\r\n\r\n=Sati.=—The burning of the dead warrior, and female immolation, or\r\n_Sati_, are well-known rites, though the magnificent cenotaphs raised on\r\nthe spot of sacrifice are little known or visited by Europeans; than\r\nwhich there are no better memorials of the rise and decline of the\r\nStates of the Rajput heptarchy. It is the son who raises the mausoleum\r\nto the memory of his father; which last token of respect, or laudable\r\nvanity, is only limited by the means of the treasury. It is\r\ncommemorative [74] of the splendour of his reign that the dome of his\r\nfather should eclipse that of his predecessor. In every principality of\r\nRajwara, the remark is applicable to chieftains as well as princes.\r\n\r\nEach sacred spot, termed ‘the place of great sacrifice’ (Mahasati), is\r\nthe haunted ground of legendary lore. Amongst the altars on which have\r\nburned the beauteous and the brave, the harpy[2.6.83] takes up her\r\nabode, and stalks forth to devour the hearts of her victims. The Rajput\r\nnever enters these places of silence but to perform stated rites, or\r\nanniversary offerings of flowers and water to the manes\r\n(pitri-deva[2.6.84]) of his ancestors.\r\n\r\nOdin[2.6.85] guarded his warriors’ final abode from rapine by means of\r\n“wandering fires which played around the tombs”; and the tenth chapter\r\nof the Salic law is on punishments against “carrying off the boards or\r\ncarpets of the tombs.” Fire and water are interdicted to such\r\nsacrilegious spoliators.\r\n\r\nThe shihaba,[2.6.86] or wandering meteoric fires, on fields of battle\r\nand in the places of ‘great sacrifice,’ produce a pleasing yet\r\nmelancholy effect; and are the source of superstitious dread and\r\nreverence to the Hindu, having their origin in the same natural cause as\r\nthe ‘wandering fires of Odin’; the phosphorescent salts produced from\r\nanimal decomposition.\r\n\r\nThe Scandinavian reared the tumulus over the ashes of the dead; so did\r\nthe Geta of the Jaxartes, and the officiating priests of Hara, the Hindu\r\ngod of battle.\r\n\r\nThe noble picture drawn by Gibbon of the sepulture of the Getic Alaric\r\nis paralleled by that of the great Jenghiz Khan. When the lofty mound\r\nwas raised, extensive forests were planted, to exclude for ever the\r\nfootsteps of man from his remains.\r\n\r\nThe tumulus, the cairn, or the pillar, still rises over the Rajput who\r\nfalls in [75] battle; and throughout Rajwara these sacrificial monuments\r\nare found, where are seen carved in relief the warrior on his steed,\r\narmed at all points; his faithful wife (_Sati_) beside him, denoting a\r\nsacrifice, and the sun and moon on either side, emblematic of\r\nnever-dying fame.\r\n\r\n=Cairns, Pillars.=—In Saurashtra, amidst the Kathi, Khuman, Bala, and\r\nothers of Scythic descent, the Paliya, or Jujhar (sacrificial pillars),\r\nare conspicuous under the walls of every town, in lines, irregular\r\ngroups, and circles. On each is displayed in rude relief the warrior,\r\nwith the manner of his death, lance in hand, generally on horseback,\r\nthough sometimes in his car; and on the coast ‘the pirates of\r\nBudha’[2.6.87] are depicted boarding from the shrouds. Amidst the Khuman\r\nof Tatary the Jesuits found stone circles, similar to those met with\r\nwherever the Celtic rites prevailed; and it would require no great\r\ningenuity to prove an analogy, if not a common origin, between Druidic\r\ncircles and the Indo-Scythic monumental remains. The trilithon, or seat,\r\nin the centre of the judicial circle, is formed by a number sacred to\r\nHara, Bal, or the sun, whose priest expounds the law.\r\n\r\n=Worship of Arms. The Sword.=—The devotion of the Rajput is still paid\r\nto his arms, as to his horse. He swears ‘by the steel,’ and prostrates\r\nhimself before his defensive buckler, his lance, his sword, or his\r\ndagger.\r\n\r\nThe worship of the sword (_asi_) may divide with that of the horse\r\n(_aswa_) the honour of giving a name to the continent of Asia. It\r\nprevailed amongst the Scythic Getae, and is described exactly by\r\nHerodotus [iv. 62]. To Dacia and Thrace it was carried by Getic colonies\r\nfrom the Jaxartes, and fostered by these lovers of liberty when their\r\nhordes overran Europe.\r\n\r\nThe worship of the sword in the Acropolis of Athens by the Getic Attila,\r\nwith all the accompaniments of pomp and place, forms an admirable\r\nepisode in the history of the decline and fall of Rome; and had Gibbon\r\nwitnessed the worship of the double-edged sword (_khanda_) by the prince\r\nof Mewar and all his chivalry, he might even have embellished his\r\nanimated account of the adoration of the scymitar, the symbol of Mars.\r\n\r\n=Initiation to Arms.=—Initiation to military fame was the same with the\r\n[76] German as with the Rajput, when the youthful candidate was\r\npresented with the lance, or buckled with the sword; a ceremony which\r\nwill be noticed when their feudal manners are described; many other\r\ntraits of character will then be depicted. It would be easy to swell the\r\nlist of analogous customs, which even to the objects of dislike in\r\nfood[2.6.88] would furnish comparison between the ancient Celt and\r\nRajput; but they shall close with the detail of the most ancient of\r\nrites.\r\n\r\n=Asvamedha, the Horse Sacrifice.=—There are some things, animate and\r\ninanimate, which have been common objects of adoration amongst the\r\nnations of the earth, the sun, the moon, and all the host of heaven; the\r\nsword; reptiles, as the serpent; animals, as the noblest, the horse.\r\nThis last was not worshipped as an abstract object of devotion, but as a\r\ntype of that glorious orb which has had reverence from every child of\r\nnature. The plains of Tatary, the sands of Libya, the rocks of Persia,\r\nthe valley of the Ganges, and the wilds of Orinoco, have each yielded\r\nvotaries alike ardent in devotion to his effulgence:\r\n\r\n                 Of this great world both eye and soul.\r\n\r\nHis symbolic worship and offerings varied with clime and habit; and\r\nwhile the altars of Bal in Asia, of Belenus among the Celts of Gaul and\r\nBritain, smoked with human sacrifices, the bull[2.6.89] bled to Mithras\r\nin Babylon, and the steed was the victim to Surya on the Jaxartes and\r\nGanges.\r\n\r\nThe father of history says that the great Getae of Central Asia deemed\r\nit right to offer the swiftest of created to the swiftest of non-created\r\nbeings. It is fair to infer that the sun’s festival with the Getae and\r\nAswa nations of the Jaxartes, as with those of Scandinavia, was the\r\nwinter solstice, the Sankrant of the Rajput and Hindu in general. _Hi_,\r\n_Haya_, _Hywor_, _Aswa_ denote the steed in Sanskrit and its dialects.\r\nIn Gothic, _hyrsa_; Teutonic, _hors_; Saxon, _horse_. The grand festival\r\nof the German tribes of the Baltic was the _Hiul_, or _Hiel_ (already\r\ncommented on), the Asvamedha[2.6.90] of the children of Surya, on the\r\nGanges.\r\n\r\n=The Asvamedha Ceremonies.=—The ceremonies of the Asvamedha are too\r\nexpensive, and attended with too great risk, to be attempted by modern\r\nprinces. Of its fatal results we have many historical records, from the\r\nfirst dawn of Indian history to the last of its princes, Prithwiraja.\r\nThe Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the poems of Chand all illustrate\r\nthis imposing rite and its effects.[2.6.91]\r\n\r\nThe Ramayana affords a magnificent picture of the Asvamedha. Dasaratha,\r\nmonarch of Ayodhya, father of Rama, is represented as commanding the\r\nrite: “Let the sacrifice be prepared, and the horse[2.6.92] liberated\r\nfrom the north bank of the Sarju!”[2.6.93] A year being ended, and the\r\nhorse having returned from his wanderings,[2.6.94] The sacrificial\r\nground was prepared on the spot of liberation.\r\n\r\nInvitations were sent to all surrounding monarchs to repair to Ayodhya:\r\nKing Kaikeya,[2.6.95] the king of Kasi,[2.6.96] Lomapada of\r\nAngadesa,[2.6.97] Kosala of Magadhadesa,[2.6.98] with the kings of\r\nSindhu,[2.6.99] Sauvira,[2.6.100] and Saurashtra [78].[2.6.101]\r\n\r\nd\r\n\r\nWhen the sacrificial pillars are erected, the rites commence. This\r\nportion of the ceremony, termed _Yupochchraya_, is thus minutely\r\ndetailed: \"There were twenty-one yupas, or pillars,[2.6.102] of\r\noctagonal shape, each twenty-one feet in height and four feet in\r\ndiameter, the capitals bearing the figure of a man, an elephant, or a\r\nbull. They were of the various sorts of wood appropriated to holy rites,\r\noverlaid with plates of gold and ornamented cloth, and adorned with\r\nfestoons of flowers. While the yupas were erecting, the Adhvaryu,\r\nreceiving his instructions from the Hotri, or sacrificing priest,\r\nrecited aloud the incantations.\r\n\r\n\"The sacrificial pits were in triple rows, eighteen in number, and\r\narranged in the form of the eagle. Here were placed the victims for\r\nimmolation; birds, aquatic animals, and the horse.\r\n\r\n\"Thrice was the steed of King Dasaratha led round the sacred fire by\r\nKosala, and as the priests pronounced the incantations he was\r\nimmolated[2.6.103] amidst shouts of joy.\r\n\r\n\"The king and queen, placed by the high priest near the horse, sat up\r\nall night watching the birds; and the officiating priest, having taken\r\nout the hearts, dressed them agreeably to the holy books. The sovereign\r\nof men smelled the smoke of the offered hearts, acknowledging his\r\ntransgressions in the order in which they were committed.\r\n\r\n\"The sixteen sacrificing priests then placed (as commanded in the\r\nordinances) on the fire the parts of the horse. The oblation of all the\r\nanimals was made on wood, except that of the horse, which was on cane.\r\n\r\n“The rite concluded with gifts of land to the sacrificing priests and\r\naugurs; but the holy men preferring gold, ten millions of\r\njambunada[2.6.104] were bestowed on them” [79].\r\n\r\nSuch is the circumstantial account of the Asvamedha, the most imposing\r\nand the earliest heathen rite on record. It were superfluous to point\r\nout the analogy between it and similar rites of various nations, from\r\nthe chosen people to the Auspex of Rome and the confessional rite of the\r\nCatholic church.\r\n\r\nThe Sankrant,[2.6.105] or Sivaratri (night of Siva), is the winter\r\nsolstice. On it the horse bled to the sun, or Balnath.\r\n\r\nThe Scandinavians termed the longest night the ‘mother night,’[2.6.106]\r\non which they held that the world was born. Hence the Beltane, the fires\r\nof Bal or Belenus; the Hiul of northern nations, the sacrificial fires\r\non the Asvamedha, or worship of the sun, by the Suryas on the Ganges,\r\nand the Syrians (Σύροι) and Sauromatae on the shores of the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe altars of the Phoenician Heliopolis, Balbee[2.6.107] or\r\nTadmor,[2.6.108] were sacred to the same divinity as on the banks of\r\nSarju, or Balpur, in Saurashtra, where \"the horses of the sun ascended\r\nfrom his fountain (_Surya-kund_),\" to carry its princes to conquest.\r\n\r\nFrom Syria came the instructors of the Celtic Druids, who made human\r\nsacrifices, and set up the pillar of Belenus on the hills of Cambria and\r\nCaledonia.\r\n\r\nWhen “Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord, and built them high\r\nplaces, and images, and groves, on every high hill and under every\r\ntree,” the object was Bal, and the pillar (the lingam) was his symbol.\r\nIt was on his altar they burned incense, and “sacrificed unto the calf\r\non the fifteenth[2.6.109] day of the month” (the sacred Amavas of the\r\nHindus). The calf of Israel is the bull (_nandi_) of Balkesar or Iswara;\r\nthe Apis of the Egyptian Osiris [80].\r\n\r\n=Sacred Trees.=—The ash was sacred to the sun-god in the west. The\r\nasvattha (or pipal)[2.6.110] is the ‘chief of trees,’ say the books\r\nsacred to Bal in the East: and death, or loss of limb, is incurred by\r\nthe sacrilegious mutilator of his consecrated groves,[2.6.111] where a\r\npillar is raised bearing the inhibitory edict.\r\n\r\nWe shall here conclude the analogy between the Indo-Scythic Rajput races\r\nand those of early Europe. Much more might be adduced; the old Runic\r\ncharacters of Scandinavia, the Celtic, and the Osci or Etruscan, might,\r\nby comparison with those found in the cave temples and rocks in\r\nRajasthan and Saurashtra, yield yet more important evidence of original\r\nsimilarity; and the very name of German (from wer, _bellum_)[2.6.112]\r\nmight be found to be derived from the _feud_ (_vair_) and _foe-man_\r\n(_vairi_) of the Rajput.\r\n\r\nIf these coincidences are merely accidental, then has too much been\r\nalready said; if not, authorities are here recorded, and hypotheses\r\nfounded, for the assistance of others [81].\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.1:\r\n\r\n  Query, if from Mogol and Aghuz, compounded, we have not the Magog, son\r\n  of Japhet, of Scripture?\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.2:\r\n\r\n  The other four sons are the remaining elements, personified: whence\r\n  the six races of Tatars.

Rubruquis the Jesuit, describing\r\n  the monuments of the Comani in the Dasht-i Kipchak, whence these\r\n  tribes, says: “Their monuments and circles of stones are like our\r\n  Celtic or Druidical remains” (Bell’s _Collection_). The Khumān are a\r\n  branch of the Kāthi tribe of Saurashtra, whose paliyas, or funeral\r\n  monumental pillars, are seen in groups at every town and village.

When\r\n  the Huns were chased from the north of China, the greater part retired\r\n  into the southern countries adjoining Europe. The rest passed directly\r\n  to the Oxus and Jaxartes; thence they spread to the Caspian and\r\n  Persian frontiers. In Mawaru-l-nahr (Transoxiana) they mixed with the\r\n  Su, the Yueh-chi, or Getes, who were particularly powerful, and\r\n  extended into Europe. One would be tempted to regard them as the\r\n  ancestors of those Getes who were known in Europe. Some bands of Su\r\n  might equally pass into the north of Europe, known as the Suevi.

It is in that ancient nail-headed character used by the\r\n  ancient Buddhists of India, and still the sacred character of the\r\n  Tatar Lamas: in short, the Pali. All the ancient inscriptions I\r\n  possess of the branches of the Agnikulas, as the Chauhan, Pramara,\r\n  Solanki, and Parihara, are in this character.

The birth of Kumar, the general of\r\n  the army of the gods, with the Hindus, is exactly that of the\r\n  Grecians, born of the goddess Jahnavi (Juno) without sexual\r\n  intercourse. Kumāra is always accompanied by the peacock, the bird of\r\n  Juno.

They are entirely heroic: each book a\r\n  relation of one of the exploits of this prince, the first warrior of\r\n  his time. They will aid a comparison between the Rajput and\r\n  Scandinavian bards, and show how far the Provençal Troubadour, the\r\n  Neustrienne Trouveur, and Minnesinger of Germany, have anything in\r\n  common with the Rajput Bardai. [For Rajput bards on horseback, drunk\r\n  with opium, singing songs to arouse warriors’ courage, see Manucci ii.\r\n  437 f.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.65:\r\n\r\n  Ἥλυσιος, from Ἥλιος, ‘the sun’; also a title of Apollo, the Hari of\r\n  India. [The two words, from the accentuation, can have no connexion.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.66:\r\n\r\n  This title of the father of Rama denotes a ‘charioteer’ [‘having ten\r\n  chariots.’ Harsha (A.D. 612-647) discarded the chariot (Smith, _EHI_,\r\n  339)].\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.67:\r\n\r\n  The Indian satrapy of Darius, says Herodotus [iii. 94], was the\r\n  richest of all the Persian provinces, and yielded six hundred talents\r\n  of gold. Arrian informs us that his Indo-Scythic subjects, in his wars\r\n  with Alexander, were the élite of his army. Besides the Sakasenae, we\r\n  find tribes in name similar to those included in the thirty-six\r\n  Rajkula; especially the Dahae (Dahya, one of the thirty-six races).\r\n  The Indo-Scythic contingent was two hundred war chariots and fifteen\r\n  elephants, which were marshalled with the Parthii on the right, and\r\n  also near Darius’s person. By this disposition they were opposed to\r\n  the cohort commanded by Alexander in person. The chariots commenced\r\n  the action, and prevented a manœuvre of Alexander to turn the left\r\n  flank of the Persians. Of their horse, also, the most honourable\r\n  mention is made; they penetrated into the division where Parmenio\r\n  commanded, to whom Alexander was compelled to send reinforcements. The\r\n  Grecian historian dwells with pleasure on Indo-Scythic valour: “there\r\n  were no equestrian feats, no distant fighting with darts, but each\r\n  fought as if victory depended on his sole arm.” They fought the Greeks\r\n  hand to hand [Arrian, _Anabasis_, iii. 15].\r\n\r\n  But the loss of empire was decreed at Arbela, and the Sakae and\r\n  Indo-Scythae had the honour of being slaughtered by the Yavans of\r\n  Greece, far from their native land, in the aid of the king of kings.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.68:\r\n\r\n  The Kathi are celebrated in Alexander’s wars. The Kathiawar Kathi can\r\n  be traced from Multan (_the ancient abode_) [_mūlasthāna_, ‘principal\r\n  place’]. The Dahya (Dahae), Johya (the latter Hunnish), and Kathi are\r\n  amongst the thirty-six races. All dwelt, six centuries ago, within the\r\n  five streams and in the deserts south of the Ghara. The two last have\r\n  left but a name.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.69:\r\n\r\n  The Sakae had invaded the inhabitants on the borders of the Pontic\r\n  Sea: whilst engaged in dividing the booty, the Persian generals\r\n  surprised them at night, and exterminated them. To eternize the\r\n  remembrance of this event, the Persians heaped up the earth round a\r\n  rock in the plain where the battle was fought, on which they erected\r\n  two temples, one to the goddess Anaītis, the other to the divinities\r\n  Omanus and Anandate, and then founded the annual festival called\r\n  _Sacaea_, still celebrated by the possessors of Zela. Such is the\r\n  account by some authors of the origin of _Sacaea_. According to others\r\n  it dates from the reign of Cyrus only. This prince, they say, having\r\n  carried the war into the country of the Sakae (Massagetae of\r\n  Herodotus) lost a battle. Compelled to fall back on his magazines,\r\n  abundantly stored with provisions, but especially wine, and having\r\n  halted some time to refresh his army, he departed before the enemy,\r\n  feigning a flight, and leaving his camp standing full of provisions.\r\n  The Sakae, who pursued, reaching the abandoned camp stored with\r\n  provisions, gave themselves up to debauch. Cyrus returned and\r\n  surprised the inebriated and senseless barbarians. Some, buried in\r\n  profound sleep, were easily massacred; others occupied in drinking and\r\n  dancing, without defence, fell into the hands of armed foes: so that\r\n  all perished. The conqueror, attributing his success to divine\r\n  protection, consecrated this day to the goddess honoured in his\r\n  country, and decreed it should be called ‘the day of the _Sacaea_.’\r\n  This is the battle related by Herodotus, to which Strabo alludes,\r\n  between the Persian monarch and Tomyris, queen of the Getae. Amongst\r\n  the Rajput Sakha, all grand battles attended with fatal results are\r\n  termed _sakha_. When besieged, without hope of relief, in the last\r\n  effort of despair, the females are immolated, and the warriors,\r\n  decorated in saffron robes, rush on inevitable destruction. This is to\r\n  perform _sakha_, where every branch (sakha) is cut off. Chitor has to\r\n  boast of having thrice (and a half) suffered sakha. _Chitor sakha ka\r\n  pap_, ‘by the sin of the sack of Chitor,’ the most solemn adjuration\r\n  of the Guhilot Rajput. If such the origin of the festival from the\r\n  slaughter of the Sakae of Tomyris, it will be allowed to strengthen\r\n  the analogy contended for between the Sakae east and west the Indus.\r\n  [For the Sacaea festival see Sir J. Frazer, _The Golden Bough, The\r\n  Dying God_, 113 ff. It has no connexion with the Rajput Sākha, ‘a\r\n  fight,’ which, again, is a different word from Sākha, ‘a branch,\r\n  clan.’]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.70:\r\n\r\n  I presented a work on this subject to the Royal Asiatic Society, as\r\n  well as another on Palmistry, etc.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.71:\r\n\r\n  _Madhu_ is intoxicating drink, from _madhu_, ‘a bee,’ in Sanskrit\r\n  [madhu, ‘anything sweet’].

I have, with friends whose eyes this\r\n  will meet, marked the procession of these lambent night-fires,\r\n  becoming extinguished at one place and rising at another, which, aided\r\n  by the unequal _locale_, have been frequently mistaken for the\r\n  Mahratta prince returning with his numerous torch-bearers from a\r\n  distant day’s sport. I have dared as bold a Rajput as ever lived to\r\n  approach them; whose sense of the levity of my desire was strongly\r\n  depicted, both in speech and mien: “men he would encounter, but not\r\n  the spirits of those erst slain in battle.” It was generally about the\r\n  conclusion of the rains that these lights were observed, when\r\n  evaporation took place from these marshy grounds impregnated with\r\n  salts.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.87:\r\n\r\n  At Dwarka, the god of thieves is called Budha Trivikrama, or of triple\r\n  energy: the Hermes Triplex, or three-headed Mercury of the Egyptians.\r\n  [No such cult is mentioned in the account of Dwārka, _BG_, viii. 601.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.88:\r\n\r\n  Caesar informs us that the Celts of Britain would not eat the hare,\r\n  goose, or domestic fowl. The Rajput will hunt the first, but neither\r\n  eats it, nor the goose, sacred to the god of battle (Hara). The Rajput\r\n  of Mewar eats the jungle fowl, but rarely the domestic.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.89:\r\n\r\n  As he did also to Balnath (the god Bal) in the ancient times of India.\r\n  The _baldan_, or gift of the bull to the sun, is well recorded.\r\n  [_Baldān_, _balidāna_ does not mean the offering of a bull: it is the\r\n  daily presentation of a portion of the meat to Earth and other\r\n  deities.] There are numerous temples in Rajasthan of Baalim [?]; and\r\n  Balpur (Mahadeo) has several in Saurashtra. All represent the sun—\r\n\r\n       Peor his other name, when he enticed\r\n       Israel in Sittim, on their march from Nile.\r\n                             _Paradise Lost_, book i. 412 f. [77].\r\n\r\n  The temple of Solomon was to Bal, and all the idolaters of that day\r\n  seem to have held to the grosser tenets of Hinduism.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.90:\r\n\r\n  In _Aswa_ (_medha_ signifies ‘to kill’) we have the derivation of the\r\n  ancient races, sons of Bajaswa, who peopled the countries on both\r\n  sides the Indus, and the probable etymon of _Asia_ [?]. The Assakenoi,\r\n  the Ariaspai of Alexander’s historians, and Aspasianae, to whom\r\n  Arsaces fled from Seleucus, and whom Strabo terms a Getic race, have\r\n  the same origin; hence Asigarh, ‘the fortress of the Asi’ (erroneously\r\n  termed Hansi), and Asgard were the first settlements of the Getic Asi\r\n  in Scandinavia. Alexander received the homage of all these Getic races\r\n  at ‘the mother of cities,’ Balkh, ‘seat of Cathaian Khan’ (the Jat\r\n  Kathida of my inscription), according to Marco Polo, from whom Milton\r\n  took his geography.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.91:\r\n\r\n  The last was undertaken by the celebrated Sawai Jai Singh of Amber;\r\n  but the milk-white steed of the sun, I believe, was not turned out, or\r\n  assuredly the Rathors would have accepted the challenge.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.92:\r\n\r\n  A milk-white steed is selected with peculiar marks. On liberation,\r\n  properly guarded, he wanders where he listeth. It is a virtual\r\n  challenge. Arjuna guarded the steed liberated by Yudhishthira; but\r\n  that sent round by Parikshita, his grandson, “was seized by the\r\n  Takshak of the north.” The same fate occurred to Sagara, father of\r\n  Dasaratha, which involved the loss of his kingdom.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.93:\r\n\r\n  The Sarju, or Gandak, from the Kumaun mountains, passes through\r\n  Kosalades, the dominion of Dasaratha.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.94:\r\n\r\n  The horse’s return after a year evidently indicates an astronomical\r\n  revolution, or the sun’s return to the same point in the ecliptic.\r\n  This return from his southern declination must have been always a day\r\n  of rejoicing to the Scythic and Scandinavian nations, who could not,\r\n  says Gibbon, fancy a worse hell than a large abode open to the cold\r\n  wind of the north. To the south they looked for the deity; and hence,\r\n  with the Rajputs, a religious law forbids their doors being to the\r\n  north.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.95:\r\n\r\n   Kaikeya is supposed by the translator, Dr. Carey, to be a king of\r\n  Persia, the Kaivansa preceding Darius. The epithet _Kai_ not\r\n  unfrequently occurs in Hindu traditional couplets. One, which I\r\n  remember, is connected with the ancient ruins of Abhaner in Jaipur,\r\n  recording the marriage of one of its princes with a daughter of\r\n  Kaikamb.\r\n\r\n  _Tu beti_ Kaikamb _ki, nam Parmala ho_, etc. ‘Thou art the daughter of\r\n  _Kaikamb_: thy name Fairy Garland.’ _Kai_ was the epithet of one of\r\n  the Persian dynasties. _Qu._ _Kam-bakhsh_, the Cambyses of the Greeks?\r\n  [Cambyses, Kābuzīya or Kambūzīya, possibly ‘a bard’ (Rawlinson,\r\n  _Herodotus_, iii. 543).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.96:\r\n\r\n  Benares.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.97:\r\n\r\n  Tibet or Ava [N.

Many years ago, when all the Rajput States were\r\n  suffering from the thraldom of the Mahrattas, a most worthy and\r\n  wealthy banker of Surat, known by the family name of Trivedi, who felt\r\n  acutely for the woes inflicted by incessant predatory foes on the sons\r\n  of Rama and Krishna, told me, with tears in his eyes, that the evils\r\n  which afflicted Jaipur were to be attributed to the sacrilege of the\r\n  prince, Jagat Singh, who had dared to abstract the gold plates of the\r\n  sacrificial pillars, and send them to his treasury: worse than\r\n  Rehoboam, who, when he took away from the temple “the shields of gold\r\n  Solomon had made,” had the grace to substitute others of brass.\r\n  Whether, when turned into currency, it went as a war contribution to\r\n  the Mahrattas, or was applied to the less worthy use of his concubine\r\n  queen, ‘the essence of camphor,’ it was of a piece with the rest of\r\n  this prince’s unwise conduct. Jai Singh, who erected the pillars, did\r\n  honour to his country, of which he was a second founder, and under\r\n  whom it attained the height from which it has now fallen. [Some\r\n  sacrificial pillars (yūpa) were recently found in the bed of the Jumna\r\n  near Mathura, with inscriptions dated in the twenty-fourth year of\r\n  Kanishka’s reign, about A.D. 102.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.103:\r\n\r\n  On the Nauroz, or festival of the new year, the Great Mogul slays a\r\n  camel with his own hand, which is distributed, and eaten by the court\r\n  favourites. [A camel is sacrificed at the Īdu-l-azha festival (Hughes,\r\n  _Dict. Islām_, 192 ff.).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.104:\r\n\r\n  This was native gold, of a peculiarly dark and brilliant hue, which\r\n  was compared to the fruit jambu (not unlike a damson). Everything\r\n  forms an allegory with the Hindus; and the production of this metal is\r\n  appropriated to the period of gestation of Jahnavi, the river-goddess\r\n  (Ganges), when by Agni, or fire, she produced Kumara, the god of war,\r\n  the commander of the army of the gods. This was when she left the\r\n  place of her birth, the Himalaya mountain (the great storehouse of\r\n  metallic substances), whose daughter she is: and doubtless this is in\r\n  allusion to some very remote period, when, bursting her rock-bound\r\n  bed, Ganga exposed from ‘her side’ veins of this precious metal.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.105:\r\n\r\n  Little bags of brocade, filled with seeds of the sesamum or cakes of\r\n  the same, are distributed by the chiefs to friends on this occasion.\r\n  While the author writes, he has before him two of these, sent to him\r\n  by the young Mahratta prince, Holkar.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.106:\r\n\r\n  Sivaratri would be ‘father night’ [?]. Siva-Iswara is the ‘universal\r\n  father.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.107:\r\n\r\n  Ferishta, the compiler of the imperial history of India, gives us a\r\n  Persian or Arabic derivation of this, from _Bal_, ‘the sun,’ and\r\n  _bec_, ‘an idol.’ [This has not been traced in Dow or Briggs.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.108:\r\n\r\n  Corrupted to Palmyra, the etymon of which, I believe, has never been\r\n  given, which is a version of Tadmor. In Sanskrit, _tal_, or _tar_, is\r\n  the ‘date-tree’; _mor_ signifies ‘chief.’ We have more than one ‘city\r\n  of palms’ (_Talpur_) in India; and the tribe ruling in Haidarabad, on\r\n  the Indus, is called _Talpuri_, from the place whence they originated.\r\n  [Tadmor is Semitic, probably meaning ‘abounding in palms.’ The\r\n  suggested derivation is impossible.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.109:\r\n\r\n  1 Kings xiv. 23.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.110:\r\n\r\n  _Ficus religiosa._ It presents a perfect resemblance to the popul\r\n  (poplar) of Germany and Italy, a species of which is the aspen. [They\r\n  belong to different orders.] So similar is it, that the specimen of\r\n  the pipal from Carolina is called, in the Isola Bella of the Lago\r\n  Maggiore, _Populus angulata_; and another, in the Jardin des Plantes\r\n  at Toulon, is termed the _Ficus populifolia, ou figuier à feuilles de\r\n  peuplier_. The aspen, or ash, held sacred by the Celtic priests, is\r\n  said to be the mountain-ash. ‘The calf of Bal’ is generally placed\r\n  under the pipal; and Hindu tradition sanctifies a never-dying stem,\r\n  which marks the spot where the Hindu Apollo, Hari (the sun), was slain\r\n  by the savage Bhil on the shores of Saurashtra. [This is known as the\r\n  Prāchi Pīpal, and death rites are performed close to it (_BG_, viii.\r\n  271, note 2).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.111:\r\n\r\n  The religious feelings of the Rajput, though outraged for centuries by\r\n  Moguls and mercenary Pathans, will not permit him to see the axe\r\n  applied to the noble pipal or umbrageous bar (_Ficus indica_), without\r\n  execrating the destroyer. Unhappy the constitution of mind which\r\n  knowingly wounds religious prejudices of such ancient date! Yet is it\r\n  thus with our countrymen in the East, who treat all foreign prejudices\r\n  with contempt, shoot the bird sacred to the Indian Mars, slay the\r\n  calves of Bal, and fell the noble pipal before the eyes of the native\r\n  without remorse. He is unphilosophic and unwise who treats such\r\n  prejudices with contumely: prejudices beyond the reach of reason. He\r\n  is uncharitable who does not respect them; impolitic, who does not use\r\n  every means to prevent such offence by ignorance or levity. It is an\r\n  abuse of our strength, and an ungenerous advantage over their\r\n  weakness. Let us recollect who are the guardians of these fanes of\r\n  Bal, his pipal, and sacred bird (the peacock); the children of Surya\r\n  and Chandra, and the descendants of the sages of yore, they who fill\r\n  the ranks of our army, and are attentive, though silent, observers of\r\n  all our actions: the most attached, the most faithful, and the most\r\n  obedient of mankind! Let us maintain them in duty, obedience, and\r\n  attachment, by respecting their prejudices and conciliating their\r\n  pride. On the fulfilment of this depends the maintenance of our\r\n  sovereignty in India: but the last fifteen years have assuredly not\r\n  increased their devotion to us. Let the question be put to the\r\n  unprejudiced, whether their welfare has advanced in proportion to the\r\n  dominion they have conquered for us, or if it has not been in the\r\n  inverse ratio of this prosperity? Have not their allowances and\r\n  comforts decreased? Does the same relative standard between the\r\n  currency and conveniences of life exist as twenty years ago? Has not\r\n  the first depreciated twenty-five per cent, as half-batta stations and\r\n  duties have increased? For the good of ruler and servant, let these be\r\n  rectified. With the utmost solemnity, I aver, I have but the welfare\r\n  of all at heart in these observations. I loved the service, I loved\r\n  the native soldier. I have proved what he will do, where devoted,\r\n  when, in 1817, thirty-two firelocks of my guard attacked, defeated,\r\n  and dispersed a camp of fifteen hundred men, slaying thrice their\r\n  numbers.[2.6.111.A] Having quitted the scene for ever, I submit my\r\n  opinion dispassionately for the welfare of the one, and with it the\r\n  stability or reverse of the other.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.6.111.A:\r\n\r\n  What says the Thermopylae of India, Corygaum? Five hundred firelocks\r\n  against twenty thousand men! Do the annals of Napoleon record a more\r\n  brilliant exploit? Has a column been reared to the manes of the brave,\r\n  European and native, of this memorable day, to excite to future\r\n  achievement? What order decks the breast of the gallant Fitzgerald,\r\n  for the exploit on the field of Nagpur? At another time and place his\r\n  words, “At my peril be it! _Charge!_” would have crowned his crest!\r\n  These things call for remedy!

The first is\r\nfrom a detached leaf of an ancient work, obtained from a Yati of a Jain\r\ntemple at the old city of Nadol, in Marwar. The second is from the poems\r\nof Chand,[2.7.2] the bard of the last Hindu king of Delhi. The third is\r\nfrom an estimable work contemporary with Chand’s, the Kumarpal\r\nCharitra[2.7.3] or “History of the Monarchy of Anhilwara Patan.” The\r\nfourth list is from the Khichi bard.[2.7.4] The fifth, from a bard of\r\nSaurashtra.\r\n\r\nFrom every one of the bardic profession, from all the collectors and\r\ncollections of Rajasthan, lists have been received, from which the\r\ncatalogue No. 6 has been formed, admitted by the genealogists to be more\r\nperfect than any existing document. From it, therefore, in succession,\r\neach race shall have its history rapidly sketched; though, as a text, a\r\nsingle name is sufficient to fill many pages.\r\n\r\nThe first list is headed by an invocation to Mata Sakambhari Devi, or\r\nmother-goddess, protectress of the races (sakha) [the mother of\r\nvegetation].\r\n\r\nEach race (sakha) has its Gotracharya,[2.7.5] a genealogical creed,\r\ndescribing [82] the essential peculiarities, religious tenets, and\r\npristine locale of the clan. Every Rajput should be able to repeat this;\r\nthough it is now confined to the family priest or the genealogist. Many\r\nchiefs, in these degenerate days, would be astonished if asked to repeat\r\ntheir gotracharya, and would refer to the bard. It is a touchstone of\r\naffinities, and guardian of the laws of intermarriage. When the\r\ninhibited degrees of propinquity have been broken, it has been known to\r\nrectify the mistake, where, however, “ignorance was bliss.”[2.7.6]\r\n\r\n                     LIST OF THE THIRTY-SIX ROYAL\r\n                RACES OF RAJASTHAN.—OM!

A few of the\r\nkula never ramified: these are termed _eka_, or ‘single’; and nearly\r\none-third are _eka_.\r\n\r\nA table of the ‘eighty-four’ mercantile tribes, chiefly of Rajput\r\norigin, shall also be furnished, in which the remembrance of some races\r\nare preserved which would have perished. Lists of the aboriginal, the\r\nagricultural and the pastoral tribes are also given to complete the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n=Solar and Lunar Races.=—In the earlier ages there were but two races,\r\nSurya and Chandra, to which were added the four Agnikulas[2.7.9]; in all\r\nsix. The others are subdivisions of Surya and Chandra, or the sakha of\r\nIndo-Scythic origin, who found no difficulty in obtaining a place\r\n(though a low one), before the Muhammadan era, amongst the thirty-six\r\nregal races of Rajasthan. The former we may not unaptly consider as to\r\nthe time, as the Celtic, the latter as the Gothic, races of India. On\r\nthe generic terms Surya and Chandra, I need add nothing [83].\r\n\r\n=Grahilot or Guhilot.=—_Pedigree_[2.7.10] _of the Suryavansi Rana, of\r\nroyal race, Lord of Chitor, the ornament of the thirty-six royal races._\r\n\r\nBy universal consent, as well as by the gotra of this race, its princes\r\nare admitted to be the direct descendants of Rama, of the Solar line.\r\nThe pedigree is deduced from him, and connected with Sumitra, the last\r\nprince mentioned in the genealogy of the Puranas.\r\n\r\nAs the origin and progressive history of this family will be fully\r\ndiscussed in the “Annals of Mewar,” we shall here only notice the\r\nchanges which have marked the patronymic, as well as the regions which\r\nhave been under their sway, from Kanaksen, who, in the second century,\r\nabandoned his native kingdom, Kosala, and established the race of Surya\r\nin Saurashtra.\r\n\r\nOn the site of Vairat, the celebrated abode of the Pandavas during\r\nexile, the descendant of Ikshwaku established his line, and his\r\ndescendant Vijaya, in a few generations, built Vijayapur.[2.7.11]\r\n\r\nThey became sovereigns, if not founders, of Valabhi, which had a\r\nseparate era of its own, called the Valabhi Samvat, according with S.\r\nVikrama 375.[2.7.12] Hence they became the Balakaraes, or kings of\r\nValabhi; a title maintained by successive dynasties of Saurashtra for a\r\nthousand years after this period, as can be satisfactorily proved by\r\ngenuine history and inscriptions.\r\n\r\nGajni, or Gaini, was another capital, whence the last prince, Siladitya\r\n(who was slain), and his family, were expelled by Parthian invaders in\r\nthe sixth century.\r\n\r\nA posthumous son, called Grahaditya, obtained a petty sovereignty at\r\nIdar. The change was marked by his name becoming the patronymic, and\r\nGrahilot, _vulgo_ Guhilot, designated the Suryavansa of Rama.\r\n\r\nWith reverses and migration from the wilds of Idar to Ahar,[2.7.13] the\r\nGuhilot was changed to Aharya, by which title the race continued to be\r\ndesignated till the twelfth century, when the elder brother, Rahup,\r\nabandoned his claim to \"the [84] throne of Chitor,\" obtained[2.7.14] by\r\nforce of arms from the Mori,[2.7.15] and settled at Dungarpur, which he\r\nyet holds, as well as the title Aharya; while the younger, Mahup,\r\nestablished the seat of power at Sesoda, whence Sesodia set aside both\r\nAharya and Guhilot.\r\n\r\nSesodia is now the common title of the race; but being only a\r\nsubdivision, the Guhilot holds its rank in the kula.\r\n\r\nThe Guhilot kula is subdivided into twenty-four sakha,[2.7.16] or\r\nramifications, few of which exist:\r\n\r\n          1.

Yudhishthira and Baladeva, on the death of\r\nKrishna and their expulsion from Delhi and Dwaraka, the last stronghold\r\nof their power, retired by Multan across the Indus. The two first are\r\nabandoned by tradition; but the sons of Krishna, who accompanied them\r\nafter an intermediate halt in the further Duab[2.7.17] of the five\r\nrivers, eventually left the Indus behind, and passed into\r\nZabulistan,[2.7.18] founded Gajni, and peopled these countries even to\r\nSamarkand.\r\n\r\nThe annals of Jaisalmer, which give this early history of their founder,\r\nmix up in a confused manner[2.7.19] the cause of their being again\r\ndriven back into India; so that it is impossible to say whether it was\r\nowing to the Greek princes who ruled all these countries for a century\r\nafter Alexander, or to the rise of Islamism.\r\n\r\nDriven back on the Indus, they obtained possession of the Panjab and\r\nfounded Salivahanpur. Thence expelled, they retired across the Sutlej\r\nand Ghara into the Indian deserts; whence expelling the Langahas, the\r\nJohyas, Mohilas, etc., they founded successively Tanot, Derawar, and\r\nJaisalmer,[2.7.20] in S. 1212,[2.7.21] the present capital of the\r\nBhattis, the lineal successors of Krishna.\r\n\r\n=Bhatti= was the exile from Zabulistan, and as usual with the Rajput\r\nraces on any such event in their annals, his name set aside the more\r\nancient patronymic, Yadu. The Bhattis subdued all the tracts south of\r\nthe Ghara; but their power has been greatly circumscribed since the\r\narrival of the Rathors. The Map defines their existing limits, and their\r\nannals will detail their past history.\r\n\r\n=Jāreja, Jādeja= is the most important tribe of Yadu race next to the\r\nBhatti. Its history is similar. Descended from Krishna, and migrating\r\nsimultaneously with the remains of the Harikulas, there is the strongest\r\nground for believing that their range was not so wide as that of the\r\nelder branch, but that they settled themselves in the valley of the\r\nIndus, more especially on the west shore in Seistan; and in nominal and\r\narmorial distinctions, even in Alexander’s time, they retained the marks\r\nof their ancestry [86].\r\n\r\nSambos, who brought on him the arms of the Grecians, was in all\r\nlikelihood a Harikula; and the Minnagara of Greek historians Samanagara\r\n(‘city of Sama’), his capital.[2.7.22]\r\n\r\nThe most common epithet of Krishna, or Hari, was Shama or Syama, from\r\nhis dark complexion. Hence the Jareja bore it as a patronymic, and the\r\nwhole race were Samaputras (children of Sama), whence the titular name\r\nSambos of its princes.[2.7.23]\r\n\r\nThe modern Jareja, who, from circumstances has so mixed with the\r\nMuhammadans of Sind as to have forfeited all pretensions to purity of\r\nblood, partly in ignorance and partly to cover disgrace, says that his\r\norigin is from Sham, or Syria, and of the stock of the Persian Jamshid:\r\nconsequently, Sam has been converted into Jam[2.7.24]; which epithet\r\ndesignates one of the Jareja petty governments, the Jam Raj.\r\n\r\nThese are the most conspicuous of the Yadu race; but there are others\r\nwho still bear the original title, of which the head is the prince of\r\nthe petty State of Karauli on the Chambal.\r\n\r\nThis portion of the Yadu stock would appear never to have strayed far\r\nbeyond the ancient limits of the Suraseni,[2.7.25] their ancestral\r\nabodes. They held the celebrated Bayana; whence expelled, they\r\nestablished Karauli west, and Sabalgarh east, of the Chambal. The tract\r\nunder the latter, called Yaduvati, has been wrested from the family by\r\nSindhia. Sri Mathura[2.7.26] is an independent fief of Karauli, held by\r\na junior branch.\r\n\r\nThe Yadus, or as pronounced in the dialects Jadon, are scattered over\r\nIndia, and many chiefs of consequence amongst the Mahrattas are of this\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\nThere are eight sakha of the Yadu race:\r\n\r\n                 1. Yadu            Chief Karauli.\r\n                 2. Bhatti          Chief Jaisalmer.\r\n                 3. Jareja          Chief Cutch Bhuj.\r\n                 4. Samecha         Muhammadans in Sind.\r\n                 5. Madecha      ┐\r\n                 6. Bidman       ├  Unknown [87].\r\n                 7. Badda        │\r\n                 8. Soha         ┘\r\n\r\n=Tuar, Tonwar, Tomara.=—The Tuar, though acknowledged as a subdivision\r\nof the Yadu, is placed by the best genealogists as one of the\r\n‘thirty-six,’ a rank to which its celebrity justly entitles it.\r\n\r\nWe have in almost every case the etymon of each celebrated race. For the\r\nTuar we have none; and we must rest satisfied in delivering the dictum\r\nof the Bardai, who declares it of Pandu origin.\r\n\r\nIf it had to boast only of Vikramaditya, the paramount lord of India,\r\nwhose era, established fifty-six years before the Christian, still\r\nserves as the grand beacon of Hindu chronology, this alone would entitle\r\nthe Tuar to the highest rank. But it has other claims to respect. Delhi,\r\nthe ancient Indraprastha, founded by Yudhishthira, and which tradition\r\nsays lay desolate for eight centuries, was rebuilt and peopled by\r\nAnangpal Tuar, in S. 848 (A.D. 792), who was followed by a dynasty of\r\ntwenty princes, which concluded with the name of the founder, Anangpal,\r\nin S. 1220 (A.D. 1164),[2.7.27] when, contrary to the Salic law of the\r\nRajputs, he abdicated (having no issue) in favour of his grandchild, the\r\nChauhan Prithviraja.\r\n\r\nThe Tuar must now rest on his ancient fame; for not an independent\r\npossession remains to the race[2.7.28] which traces its lineage to the\r\nPandavas, boasts of Vikrama, and which furnished the last dynasty,\r\nemperors of Hindustan.\r\n\r\nIt would be a fact unparalleled in the history of the world, could we\r\nestablish to conviction that the last Anangpal Tuar was the lineal\r\ndescendant of the founder of Indraprastha; that the issue of\r\nYudhishthira sat on the throne which he erected, after a lapse of 2250\r\nyears. Universal consent admits it, and the fact is as well established\r\nas most others of a historic nature of such a distant period: nor can\r\nany dynasty or family of Europe produce evidence so strong as the Tuar,\r\neven to a much less remote antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe chief possessions left to the Tuars are the district of Tuargarh, on\r\nthe right bank of the Chambal towards its junction with the Jumna, and\r\nthe small [88] chieftainship of Patan Tuarvati in the Jaipur State, and\r\nwhose head claims affinity with the ancient kings of Indraprastha.\r\n\r\n=Rāthor.=—A doubt hangs on the origin of this justly celebrated race.\r\nThe Rathor genealogies trace their pedigree to Kusa, the second son of\r\nRama; consequently they would be Suryavansa. But by the bards of this\r\nrace they are denied this honour; and although Kushite, they are held to\r\nbe the descendants of Kasyapa, of the Solar race, by the daughter of a\r\nDaitya (Titan). The progeny of Hiranyakasipu is accordingly stigmatized\r\nas being of demoniac origin. It is rather singular that they should have\r\nsucceeded to the Lunar race of Kusanabha, descendants of Ajamidha, the\r\nfounders of Kanauj. Indeed, some genealogists maintain the Rathors to be\r\nof Kusika race.\r\n\r\nThe pristine locale of the Rathors is Gadhipura, or Kanauj, where they\r\nare found enthroned in the fifth century; and though beyond that period\r\nthey connect their line with the princes of Kosala or Ayodhya, the fact\r\nrests on assertion only.\r\n\r\nFrom the fifth century their history is cleared from the mist of ages,\r\nwhich envelops them all prior to this time; and in the period\r\napproaching the Tatar conquest of India, we find them contesting with\r\nthe last Tuar and Chauhan kings of Delhi, and the Balakaraes of\r\nAnhilwara, the right to paramount importance amidst the princes of Ind.\r\nThe combats for this phantom supremacy destroyed them all. Weakened by\r\ninternal strife, the Chauhan of Delhi fell, and his death exposed the\r\nnorth-west frontier. Kanauj followed; and while its last prince,\r\nJaichand, found a grave in the Ganges, his son sought an asylum in\r\nMarusthali, ‘the regions of death.’[2.7.29] Siahji was this son; the\r\nfounder of the Rathor dynasty in Marwar, on the ruins of the Pariharas\r\nof Mandor. Here they brought their ancient martial spirit, and a more\r\nvaliant being exists not than can be found amongst the sons of Siahji.\r\nThe Mogul emperors were indebted for half their conquests to the _Lakh\r\nTarwar Rathoran_, ‘the 100,000 swords of the Rathors’; for it is beyond\r\na doubt that 50,000 of the blood of Siahji have been embodied at once.\r\nBut enough of the noble Rathors for the present.\r\n\r\nThe Rathor has twenty-four sakha: Dhandal, Bhadel, Chachkit, Duharia,\r\nKhokra, Badara, Chajira, Ramdeva, Kabria, Hatundia, Malavat, Sunda,\r\nKatecha, Maholi, Gogadeva, Mahecha, Jaisingha, Mursia, Jobsia, Jora,\r\netc., etc.[2.7.30] [89].\r\n\r\n_Rathor Gotracharya._—Gotama[2.7.31] Gotra (race),—Mardawandani Sakha\r\n(branch),—Sukracharya Guru (Regent of the planet Venus,\r\nPreceptor),—Garupata Agni,[2.7.32]—Pankhani Devi (tutelary goddess,\r\nwinged).[2.7.33]\r\n\r\n=Kachhwāha.=—The Kachhwaha race[2.7.34] is descended from Kusa, the\r\nsecond son of Rama. They are the Kushites[2.7.35] as the Rajputs of\r\nMewar are the Lavites of India. Two branches migrated from Kosala: one\r\nfounded Rohtas on the Son, the other established a colony amidst the\r\nravines of the Kuwari, at Lahar.[2.7.36] In the course of time they\r\nerected the celebrated fortress of Narwar, or Nirwar, the abode of the\r\ncelebrated Raja Nala, whose descendants continued to hold possession\r\nthroughout all the vicissitudes of the Tatar and Mogul domination, when\r\nthey were deprived of it by the Mahrattas, and the abode of Nala is now\r\na dependency of Sindhia.\r\n\r\nIn the tenth century a branch emigrated and founded Amber, dispossessing\r\nthe aborigines, the Minas, and adding from the Rajput tribe Bargujar,\r\nwho held Rajor and large possessions around. But even in the twelfth\r\ncentury the Kachhwahas were but principal vassals to the Chauhan king of\r\nDelhi; and they have to date their greatness, as the other families\r\n(especially the Ranas of Mewar) of Rajasthan their decline, from the\r\nascent of the house of Timur to the throne of Delhi. The map shows the\r\nlimits of the sway of the Kachhwahas, including their branches, the\r\nindependent Narukas of Macheri, and the tributary confederated\r\nShaikhavats. The Kachhwaha subdivisions have been mislaid;[2.7.37] but\r\nthe present partition into Kothris (chambers), of which there are\r\ntwelve, shall be given in their annals.\r\n\r\n=Agnikulas, Pramāra.=—1st _Pramara_. There are four races to whom the\r\nHindu genealogists have given Agni, or the element of fire, as\r\nprogenitor. The Agnikulas are therefore the sons of Vulcan, as the\r\nothers are of Sol,[2.7.38] Mercurius, and Terra [90].\r\n\r\nThe Agnikulas are the Pramara, the Parihara, the Chalukya or Solanki,\r\nand the Chauhan.[2.3.39]\r\n\r\nThat these races, the sons of Agni, were but regenerated, and converted\r\nby the Brahmans to fight their battles, the clearest interpretations of\r\ntheir allegorical history will disclose; and, as the most ancient of\r\ntheir inscriptions are in the Pali character, discovered wherever the\r\nBuddhist religion prevailed, their being declared of the race of Tasta\r\nor Takshak,[2.3.40] warrants our asserting the Agnikulas to be of this\r\nsame race, which invaded India about two centuries before Christ. It was\r\nabout this period that Parsvanatha the twenty-third Buddha,[2.3.41]\r\nappeared in India; his symbol, the serpent. The legend of the snake\r\n(Takshak) escaping with the celebrated work Pingala, which was recovered\r\nby Garuda, the eagle of Krishna, is purely allegorical; and descriptive\r\nof the contentions between the followers of Parswanatha, figured under\r\nhis emblem, the snake, and those of Krishna, depicted under his sign,\r\nthe eagle.\r\n\r\nThe worshippers of Surya probably recovered their power on the\r\nexterminating civil wars of the Lunar races, but the creation of the\r\nAgnikulas is expressly stated to be for the preservation of the altars\r\nof Bal, or Iswara, against the Daityas, or Atheists.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Abu, or Arbuda, the Olympus of Rajasthan, was the scene\r\nof contention between the ministers of Surya and these Titans, and their\r\nrelation might, with the aid of imagination, be equally amusing with the\r\nTitanic war of the ancient poets of the west [91]. The Buddhists claim\r\nit for Adinath, their first Buddha; the Brahmans for Iswara, or, as the\r\nlocal divinity styled Achaleswara.[2.7.42] The Agnikunda is still shown\r\non the summit of Abu, where the four races were created by the Brahmans\r\nto fight the battles of Achaleswara and polytheism, against the\r\nmonotheistic Buddhists, represented as the serpents or Takshaks. The\r\nprobable period of this conversion has been hinted at; but of the\r\ndynasties issuing from the Agnikulas, many of the princes professed the\r\nBuddhist or Jain faith, to periods so late as the Muhammadan invasion.\r\n\r\nThe Pramara, though not, as his name implies, the ‘chief warrior,’ was\r\nthe most potent of the Agnikulas. He sent forth thirty-five sakha, or\r\nbranches, several of whom enjoyed extensive sovereignties. ‘The world is\r\nthe Pramar’s,’ is an ancient saying, denoting their extensive sway; and\r\nthe Naukot[2.7.43] Marusthali signified the nine divisions into which\r\nthe country, from the Sutlej to the ocean, was partitioned amongst them.\r\n\r\nMaheswar, Dhar, Mandu, Ujjain, Chandrabhaga, Chitor, Abu, Chandravati,\r\nMhau Maidana, Parmavati, Umarkot, Bakhar, Lodorva, and Patan are the\r\nmost conspicuous of the capitals they conquered or founded.\r\n\r\nThough the Pramara family never equalled in wealth the famed Solanki\r\nprinces of Anhilwara, or shone with such lustre as the Chauhan, it\r\nattained a wider range and an earlier consolidation of dominion than\r\neither, and far excelled in all, the Parihara, the last and least of the\r\nAgnikulas, which it long held tributary.\r\n\r\nMaheswar, the ancient seat of the Haihaya kings, appears to have been\r\nthe first seat of government of the Pramaras. They subsequently founded\r\nDharanagar, and Mandu on the crest of the Vindhya hills; and to them is\r\neven attributed the city of Ujjain, the first meridian of the Hindus,\r\nand the seat of Vikrama.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous records of the family, fixing eras in their history\r\nof more modern times; and it is to be hoped that the interpretation of\r\nyet undeciphered inscriptions may carry us back beyond the seventh\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe era[2.7.44] of Bhoj, the son of Munja, has been satisfactorily\r\nsettled; and an [92] inscription[2.7.45] in the nail-headed character,\r\ncarries it back a step further,[2.7.46] and elicits an historical fact\r\nof infinite value, giving the date of the last prince of the Pramaras of\r\nChitor, and the consequent accession of the Guhilots.\r\n\r\nThe Nerbudda was no limit to the power of the Pramaras. About the very\r\nperiod of the foregoing inscription, Ram Pramar held his court in\r\nTelingana, and is invested by the Chauhan Bard, Chand, with the dignity\r\nof paramount sovereign of India, and head of a splendid feudal[2.7.47]\r\nassociation, whose members became independent on his death. The Bard\r\nmakes this a voluntary act of the Pramaras; but coupled with the\r\nGuhilots’ violent acquisition of Chitor, we may suppose the successor of\r\nRam was unable to maintain such supremacy.\r\n\r\nWhile Hindu literature survives the name of Bhoj Pramara and ‘the nine\r\ngems’ of his court cannot perish; though it is difficult to say which of\r\nthe three[2.7.48] princes of this name is particularly alluded to, as\r\nthey all appear to have been patrons of science.\r\n\r\nChandragupta, the supposed opponent of Alexander, was a Maurya, and in\r\nthe sacred genealogies is declared of the race of Takshak. The ancient\r\ninscriptions of the Pramars, of which the Maurya is a principal branch,\r\ndeclare it of the race of Tasta and Takshak, as does that now given from\r\nthe seat of their power, Chitor.[2.7.49]\r\n\r\nSalivahana, the conqueror of Vikramaditya, was a Takshak, and his era\r\nset aside that of the Tuar in the Deccan.\r\n\r\nNot one remnant of independence exists to mark the greatness of the\r\nPramaras: ruins are the sole records of their power. The prince of\r\nDhat,[2.7.50] in the Indian [93] desert, is the last phantom of royalty\r\nof the race; and the descendant of the prince who protected Humayun,\r\nwhen driven from the throne of Timur, in whose capital, Umarkot, the\r\ngreat Akbar was born, is at the foot of fortune’s ladder; his throne in\r\nthe desert, the footstool of the Baloch, on whose bounty he is dependent\r\nfor support.\r\n\r\nAmong the thirty-five sakha of the Pramaras the Vihal was eminent, the\r\nprinces of which line appear to have been lords of Chandravati, at the\r\nfoot of the Aravalli. The Rao of Bijolia, one of the sixteen superior\r\nnobles of the Rana’s court, is a Pramara of the ancient stock of Dhar,\r\nand perhaps its most respectable representative.\r\n\r\n                   THIRTY-FIVE SAKHA OF THE PRAMARAS\r\n\r\n_Mori_ [or _Maurya_].—Of which was Chandragupta, and the princes of\r\nChitor prior to the Guhilot.\r\n\r\n_Sodha._—Sogdoi of Alexander, the princes of Dhat in the Indian desert.\r\n\r\n_Sankhla._—Chiefs of Pugal, and in Marwar.\r\n\r\n_Khair._—Capital Khairalu.\r\n\r\n_Umra and Sumra._—Anciently in the desert, now Muhammadans.\r\n\r\n_Vihal, or Bihal._—Princes of Chandravati.\r\n\r\n_Mepawat._—Present chief of Bijolia in Mewar.\r\n\r\n_Balhar._—Northern desert.\r\n\r\n_Kaba._—Celebrated in Saurashtra in ancient times, a few yet in Sirohi.\r\n\r\n_Umata._—The princes of Umatwara in Malwa, there established for twelve\r\ngenerations. Umatwara is the largest tract left to the Pramaras. Since\r\nthe war in 1817, being under the British interference, they cannot be\r\ncalled independent.\r\n\r\n         _Rehar_              ┐\r\n         _Dhunda_             ├  Girasia petty chiefs in Malwa.\r\n         _Sorathia_           │\r\n         _Harer_[2.7.51]      ┘\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.51:\r\n\r\n  [For a different list see _Census Report Rajputana, 1911_, i. 255.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBesides others unknown; as Chaonda, Khejar, Sagra, Barkota, Puni,\r\nSampal, Bhiba, Kalpusar, Kalmoh, Kohila, Papa, Kahoria, Dhand, Deba,\r\nBarhar, Jipra, Posra, Dhunta, Rikamva, and Taika. Many of these are\r\nproselytes to Islamism, and several beyond the Indus [94].\r\n\r\n=Chahuman or Chauhan.=—On this race so much has been said\r\nelsewhere,[2.7.52] that it would be superfluous to give more than a\r\nrapid sketch of them here.\r\n\r\nThis is the most valiant of the Agnikulas, and it may be asserted not of\r\nthem only, but of the whole Rajput race. Actions may be recorded of the\r\ngreater part of each of the Chhattis-kula, which would yield to none in\r\nthe ample and varied pages of history; and though the ‘Talwar Rathoran’\r\nwould be ready to contest the point, impartial decision, with a\r\nknowledge of their respective merits, must assign to the Chauhan the van\r\nin the long career of arms.\r\n\r\nIts branches (sakha) have maintained all the vigour of the original\r\nstem; and the Haras, the Khichis, the Deoras, the Sonigiras, and others\r\nof the twenty-four, have their names immortalised in the song of the\r\nbard.\r\n\r\nThe derivation of Chauhan is coeval with his fabulous birth: ‘the\r\nfour-handed warrior’ (_Chatur-bhuja Chatur-bahu Vira_). All failed when\r\nsent against the demons, but the Chauhan, the last creation of the\r\nBrahmans to fight their battles against infidelity.\r\n\r\nA short extract may be acceptable from the original respecting the birth\r\nof the Chauhan, to guard the rites of our Indian Jove on this Olympus,\r\nthe sacred Abu: “the Guru of mountains, like Sumer or Kailas, which\r\nAchaleswara made his abode. Fast but one day on its summit, and your\r\nsins will be forgiven; reside there for a year, and you may become the\r\npreceptor of mankind.”\r\n\r\n=The Agnikunda Fire-pit.=—Notwithstanding the sanctity of Abu, and the\r\nlittle temptation to disturb the anchorites of Bal, “the Munis, who\r\npassed their time in devotion, whom desire never approached, who drew\r\nsupport from the cow, from roots, fruits, and flowers,” yet did the\r\nDaityas, envying their felicity, render the sacrifice impure, and stop\r\nin transit the share of the gods. “The Brahmans dug the pit for\r\nburnt-sacrifice to the south-west (nairrit); but the demons[2.7.53]\r\nraised storms which darkened the air and filled it with clouds of sand,\r\nshowering ordure, blood, bones and flesh, with every impurity, on their\r\nrites. Their penance was of no avail.”\r\n\r\nAgain they kindled the sacred fire; and the priests, assembling round\r\nthe Agnikunda,[2.7.54] prayed for aid to Mahadeo [95]. \"From the\r\nfire-fountain a figure issued forth, but he had not a warrior’s mien.\r\nThe Brahmans placed him as guardian of the gate, and thence his name,\r\nPrithivi-dwara.[2.7.55] A second issued forth, and being formed in the\r\npalm (_challu_) of the hand was named Chalukya. A third appeared and was\r\nnamed Pramara.[2.7.56] He had the blessing of the Rishis, and with the\r\nothers went against the demons, but they did not prevail. Again\r\nVasishtha,[2.7.57] seated on the lotus, prepared incantations; again he\r\ncalled the gods to aid: and, as he poured forth the libation, a figure\r\narose, lofty in stature, of elevated front, hair like jet, eyes rolling,\r\nbreast expanded, fierce, terrific, clad in armour, quiver filled, a bow\r\nin one hand and a brand in the other, quadriform (_Chaturanga_),[2.7.58]\r\nwhence his name, _Chauhan_.\r\n\r\n“Vasishtha prayed that his hope[2.7.59] might be at length fulfilled, as\r\nthe Chauhan was despatched against the demons. Sakti-devi[2.7.60] on her\r\nlion, armed with the trident, descended, and bestowed her blessing on\r\nthe Chauhan, and as Asapurna, or Kalika, promised always to hear his\r\nprayer. He went against the demons; their leaders he slew. The rest\r\nfled, nor halted till they reached the depths of hell. Anhal slew the\r\ndemons. The Brahmans were made happy; and of his race was\r\nPrithwiraja.”[2.7.61]\r\n\r\nThe genealogical tree of the Chauhans exhibits thirty-nine princes, from\r\nAnhal, the first created Chauhan, to Prithwiraja, the last of the Hindu\r\nemperors of India.[2.7.62] But whether the chain is entire we cannot\r\nsay. The inference is decidedly against its being so; for this creation\r\nor regeneration is assigned to an age centuries anterior to\r\nVikramaditya: and we may safely state these converts to be of the\r\nTakshak race, invaders of India at a very early period.\r\n\r\nAjaipal is a name celebrated in the Chauhan chronicles, as the founder\r\nof the fortress of Ajmer, one of the earliest establishments of Chauhan\r\npower.[2.7.63]\r\n\r\nSambhar,[2.7.64] on the banks of the extensive salt lake of the same\r\nname, was probably anterior to Ajmer, and yielded an epithet to the\r\nprinces of this race, who [96] were styled Sambhari Rao. These continued\r\nto be the most important places of Chauhan power, until the translation\r\nof Prithwiraja to the imperial throne of Delhi threw a parting halo of\r\nsplendour over the last of its independent kings. There were several\r\nprinces whose actions emblazon the history of the Chauhans. Of these was\r\nManika Rae, who first opposed the progress of the Muhammadan arms. Even\r\nthe history of the conquerors records that the most obstinate opposition\r\nwhich the arms of Mahmud of Ghazni encountered was from the prince of\r\nAjmer,[2.7.65] who forced him to retreat, foiled and disgraced, from\r\nthis celebrated stronghold, in his destructive route to Saurashtra.\r\n\r\nThe attack on Manika Rae appears to have been by Kasim, the general of\r\nWalid, on the close of the first century of the Hegira.[2.7.66] The\r\nsecond attack was at the end of the fourth century. A third was during\r\nthe reign of Bisaladeva, who headed a grand confederacy of the Rajput\r\nprinces against the foes of their religion. The celebrated Udayaditya\r\nPramar is enumerated amongst the chiefs acting in subserviency to the\r\nChauhan prince on this occasion, and as his death has been fixed by\r\nunerring records in A.D. 1096, this combination must have been against\r\nthe Islamite king Maudud, the fourth from Mahmud; and to this victory is\r\nthe allusion in the inscription on the ancient pillar of Delhi.[2.7.67]\r\nBut these irruptions continued to the captivity and death of the last of\r\nthe Chauhans, whose reign exhibits a splendid picture of feudal manners.\r\n\r\nThe Chauhans sent forth twenty-four branches, of whom the most\r\ncelebrated are the existing families of Bundi and Kotah, in the division\r\ntermed Haravati. They have well maintained the Chauhan reputation for\r\nvalour. Six princely brothers shed their blood in one field, in the\r\nsupport of the aged Shah Jahan against his rebellious son Aurangzeb, and\r\nof the six but one survived his wounds.\r\n\r\nThe Khichis[2.7.68] of Gagraun and Raghugarh, the Deoras of Sirohi, the\r\nSonigiras of Jalor, the Chauhans of Sui Bah and Sanchor, and the\r\nPawechas of Pawagarh, have all immortalized themselves by the most\r\nheroic and devoted deeds. Most of these families yet exist, brave as in\r\nthe days of Prithwiraja.\r\n\r\nMany chiefs of the Chauhan race abandoned their faith to preserve their\r\nlands, the Kaimkhani,[2.7.69] the Sarwanis, the Lowanis, the Kararwanis,\r\nand the Bedwanas [97], chiefly residing in Shaikhavati, are the most\r\nconspicuous. No less than twelve petty princes thus deserted their\r\nfaith: which, however, is not contrary to the Rajput creed; for even\r\nManu says, they may part with wife to preserve their land. Isaridas,\r\nnephew of Prithwiraja, was the first who set this example.\r\n\r\n_Twenty-four Sakha of the Chauhans._—Chauhan, Hara, Khichi, Sonigira,\r\nDeora, Pabia, Sanchora, Goelwal, Bhadauria, Nirwan, Malani, Purbia,\r\nSura, Madrecha, Sankrecha, Bhurecha, Balecha, Tasera, Chachera, Rosia,\r\nChanda, Nikumbha, Bhawar, and Bankat.[2.7.70]\r\n\r\n=Chalukya or Solanki.=—Though we cannot trace the history of this branch\r\nof the Agnikulas to such periods of antiquity as the Pramara or Chauhan,\r\nit is from the deficiency of materials, rather than any want of\r\ncelebrity, that we are unable to place it, in this respect, on a level\r\nwith them. The tradition of the bard makes the Solankis important as\r\nprinces of Sura on the Ganges, ere the Rathors obtained Kanauj.[2.7.71]\r\nThe genealogical test[2.7.72] claims Lohkot, said to be the ancient\r\nLahore, as a residence, which makes them of the same Sakha (Madhwani) as\r\nthe Chauhans. Certain it is, that in the eighth century we find the\r\nLangahas[2.7.73] and Togras inhabiting Multan and the surrounding\r\ncountry, the chief opponents of the Bhattis on their establishment in\r\nthe desert. They were princes of Kalyan, on the Malabar coast,[2.7.74]\r\nwhich city still exhibits vestiges of ancient grandeur. It was from\r\nKalyan that a scion of the Solanki tree was taken, and engrafted on the\r\nroyal stem of the Chawaras of Anhilwara Patan.\r\n\r\nIt was in S. 987 (A.D. 931) that Bhojraj, the last of the Chawaras, and\r\nthe Salic law of India were both set aside, to make way for the young\r\nSolanki, Mulraj,[2.7.75] who ruled Anhilwara for the space of\r\nfifty-eight years. During the reign of his son and successor, Chamund\r\nRae,[2.7.76] Mahmud of Ghazni carried his desolating arms into the\r\nkingdom of Anhilwara. With its wealth he raised those [98] magnificent\r\ntrophies of his conquest, among which the ‘Celestial Bride’ might have\r\nvied with anything ever erected by man as a monument of folly.[2.7.77]\r\nThe wealth abstracted, as reported in the history of the conquerors, by\r\nthis scourge of India, though deemed incredible, would obtain belief, if\r\nthe commercial riches of Anhilwara could be appreciated. It was to India\r\nwhat Venice was to Europe, the entrepôt of the products of both the\r\neastern and western hemispheres. It fully recovered the shock given by\r\nMahmud and the desultory wars of his successors; and we find Siddharaja\r\nJayasingha,[2.7.78] the seventh from the founder, at the head of the\r\nrichest, if not the most warlike, kingdom of India. Two-and-twenty\r\nprincipalities at one time owned his power, from the Carnatic to the\r\nbase of the Himalaya Mountains; but his unwise successor drew upon\r\nhimself the vengeance of the Chauhan, Prithwiraja, a slip of which race\r\nwas engrafted, in the person of Kumarapala, on the genealogical tree of\r\nthe Solankis;[2.7.79] and it is a curious fact that this dynasty of the\r\nBalakaraes alone gives us two examples of the Salic law of India being\r\nviolated. Kumarapala, installed on the throne of Anhilwara, ‘tied round\r\nhis head the turban of the Solanki.’ He became of the tribe into which\r\nhe was adopted. Kumarapala, as well as Siddharaja, was the patron of\r\nBuddhism;[2.7.80] and the monuments erected under them and their\r\nsuccessors claim our admiration, from their magnificence and the\r\nperfection of the arts; for at no period were they more cultivated than\r\nat the courts of Anhilwara.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenants of Shihābu-d-din disturbed the close of Kumarapal’s\r\nreign; and his successor, Balo Muldeo, closed this dynasty in S. 1284\r\n(A.D. 1228), when a new dynasty, called the Vaghela (descendants of\r\nSiddharaja) under Bīsaldeo, succeeded.[2.7.81] The dilapidations from\r\nreligious persecution were repaired; Somnath, renowned as Delphos of\r\nold, rose from its ruins, and the kingdom of the Balakaraes was\r\nattaining its pristine magnificence, when, under the fourth prince,\r\nKarandeva, the angel of destruction appeared in the shape of Alau-d-din,\r\nand the kingdom of Anhilwara was annihilated. The lieutenants of the\r\nTatar despot of Delhi let loose the spirit of intolerance and avarice on\r\nthe rich cities and fertile plains of Gujarat and Saurashtra. In\r\ncontempt of their faith, the altar of an Islamite Darvesh was placed in\r\ncontact with the shrine of Adinath, on the [99] most accessible of their\r\nsacred mounts:[2.7.82] the statues of Buddha [the Jain Tirthankaras]\r\nwere thrown down, and the books containing the mysteries of their faith\r\nsuffered the same fate as the Alexandrian library. The walls of\r\nAnhilwara were demolished; its foundations excavated, and again filled\r\nup with the fragments of their ancient temples.[2.7.83]\r\n\r\nThe remnants of the Solanki dynasty were scattered over the land, and\r\nthis portion of India remained for upwards of a century without any\r\nparamount head, until, by a singular dispensation of Providence, its\r\nsplendour was renovated, and its foundations rebuilt, by an adventurer\r\nof the same race from which the Agnikulas were originally converts,\r\nthough Saharan the Tak hid his name and his tribe under his new epithet\r\nof Zafar Khan, and as Muzaffar ascended the throne of Gujarat, which he\r\nleft to his son. This son was Ahmad, who founded Ahmadabad, whose most\r\nsplendid edifices were built from the ancient cities around it.[2.7.84]\r\n\r\n=Bāghels.=—Though the stem of the Solankis was thus uprooted, yet was it\r\nnot before many of its branches (Sakha), like their own indigenous\r\nbar-tree, had fixed themselves in other soils. The most conspicuous of\r\nthese is the Baghela[2.7.85] family, which gave its name to an entire\r\ndivision of Hindustan; and Baghelkhand has now been ruled for many\r\ncenturies by the descendants of Siddharaja.\r\n\r\nBesides Bandhugarh, there are minor chieftainships still in Gujarat of\r\nthe Baghela tribe. Of these, Pethapur and Tharad are the most\r\nconspicuous. One of the chieftains of the second class in Mewar is a\r\nSolanki, and traces his line immediately from Siddharaja: this is the\r\nchief of Rupnagar,[2.7.86] whose stronghold commands one of the passes\r\nleading to Marwar, and whose family annals would furnish a fine picture\r\nof the state of border-feuds. Few of them, till of late years, have died\r\nnatural deaths.\r\n\r\nThe Solanki is divided into sixteen branches [100].\r\n\r\n 1. Baghela—Raja of Baghelkhand (capital Bandhugarh), Raos of Pitapur,\r\n   Tharad, and Adalaj, etc.\r\n 2. Birpura—Rao of Lunawara.\r\n 3. Bahala—Kalyanpur in Mewar, styled Rao, but serving the chief of\r\n   Salumbar.\r\n 4. Bhurta[2.7.87] ┐ In Baru, Tekra, and Chahir, in Jaisalmer.\r\n 5. Kalacha[2.7.87] ┘\r\n 6. Langaha—Muslims about Multan.\r\n 7. Togra—Muslims in the Panjnad.\r\n 8. Brika—    ”              ”\r\n 9. Surki—In Deccan.\r\n 10. Sarwaria[2.7.88]—Girnar in Saurashtra.\r\n 11. Raka—Toda in Jaipur.\r\n 12. Ranakia—Desuri in Mewar.\r\n 13. Kharara—Alota and Jawara, in Malwa.\r\n 14. Tantia—Chandbhar Sakanbari.[2.7.89]\r\n 15. Almecha—No land.\r\n 16. Kalamor—Gujarat.[2.7.90]\r\n\r\n=Pratihāra or Parihāra.=—Of this, the last and least of the Agnikulas,\r\nwe have not much to say. The Pariharas never acted a conspicuous part in\r\nthe history of Rajasthan. They are always discovered in a subordinate\r\ncapacity, acting in feudal subjection to the Tuars of Delhi or the\r\nChauhans of Ajmer; and the brightest page of their history is the record\r\nof an abortive attempt of Nahar Rao to maintain his independence against\r\nPrithwiraja. Though a failure, it has immortalized his name, and given\r\nto the scene of action,[2.7.91] one of the passes of the Aravalli, a\r\nmerited celebrity. Mandor[2.7.91] (classically Maddodara) was the\r\ncapital of the Parihars, and was the chief city of Marwar which owned\r\nthe sway of this tribe prior to the invasion and settlement of the\r\nRathors. It is placed five miles northward of the modern [101] Jodhpur,\r\nand preserves some specimens of the ancient Pali character, fragments of\r\nsculpture and Jain temples.\r\n\r\nThe Rathor emigrant princes of Kanauj found an asylum with the Parihars.\r\nThey repaid it by treachery, and Chonda, a name celebrated in the Rathor\r\nannals, dispossessed the last of the Parihars, and pitched the flag of\r\nthe Rathors on the battlements of Mandor. The power of the Parihars had,\r\nhowever, been much reduced previously by the princes of Mewar, who not\r\nonly abstracted much territory from them, but assumed the title of its\r\nprinces—Rana.[2.7.92]\r\n\r\nThe Parihara is scattered over Rajasthan, but I am unaware of the\r\nexistence of any independent chieftainship there. At the confluence of\r\nthe Kuhari, the Sind, and the Chambal, there is a colony of this race,\r\nwhich has given its name to a commune of twenty-four villages, besides\r\nhamlets, situated amidst the ravines of these streams. They were\r\nnominally subjects of Sindhia; but it was deemed requisite for the line\r\nof defence along the Chambal that it should be included within the\r\nBritish demarcation, by which we incorporated with our rule the most\r\nnotorious body of thieves in the annals of Thug history.\r\n\r\nThe Parihars had twelve subdivisions, of which the chief were the Indha\r\nand Sindhal: a few of both are still to be found about the banks of the\r\nLuni.[2.7.93]\r\n\r\n=Chāwara or Chaura.=—This tribe was once renowned in the history of\r\nIndia, though its name is now scarcely known, or only in the chronicles\r\nof the bard. Of its origin we are in ignorance. It belongs neither to\r\nthe Solar nor Lunar race, and consequently we may presume it to be of\r\nScythic origin.[2.7.94] The name is unknown in Hindustan, and is\r\nconfined, with many others originating from beyond the Indus, to the\r\npeninsula of Saurashtra. If foreign to India proper, its establishment\r\nmust have been at a remote period, as we find individuals of it\r\nintermarrying with the Suryavansa ancestry of the present princes of\r\nMewar, when this family were the lords of Valabhi.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the Chawaras was the insular Deobandar, on the coast of\r\nSaurashtra, and the celebrated temple of Somnath, with many others on\r\nthis coast, dedicated to Balnath, or the sun, is attributed to this\r\ntribe of the Sauras,[2.7.95] or [102] worshippers of the sun; most\r\nprobably the generic name of the tribe as well as of the\r\npeninsula.[2.7.96]\r\n\r\nBy a natural catastrophe, or as the Hindu superstitious chroniclers will\r\nhave it, as a punishment for the piracies of the prince of Deo, the\r\nelement whose privilege he abused rose and overwhelmed his capital. As\r\nall this coast is very low, such an occurrence is not improbable; though\r\nthe abandonment of Deo might have been compelled by the irruptions of\r\nthe Arabians, who at this period carried on a trade with these parts,\r\nand the plunder of some of their vessels may have brought this\r\npunishment on the Chawaras. That it was owing to some such political\r\ncatastrophe, we have additional grounds for belief from the annals of\r\nMewar, which state that its princes inducted the Chawaras into the seats\r\nof the power they abandoned on the continent and peninsula of\r\nSaurashtra.\r\n\r\nAt all events, the prince of Deo laid the foundation of Anhilwara Patan\r\nin S. 802 (A.D. 746), which henceforth became the capital city of this\r\nportion of India, in lieu of Valabhipura, which gave the title of\r\nBalakaraes to its princes, the Balhara of the earlier Arabian\r\ntravellers, and following them, the geographers of Europe.[2.7.97]\r\n\r\nVana Raja (or, in the dialects, Banraj) was this founder, and his\r\ndynasty ruled for one hundred and eighty-four years, when, as related in\r\nthe sketch of the Solanki tribe, Bhojraj, the seventh from the founder,\r\nwas deposed by his nephew.[2.7.98] It was during this dynasty that the\r\nArabian travellers[2.7.99] visited this court, of which they have left\r\nbut a confused picture. We are not, however, altogether in darkness\r\nregarding the Chawara race, as in the Khuman Raesa, one of the\r\nchronicles of Mewar, mention is made of the auxiliaries under a leader\r\nnamed Chatansi, in the defence of Chitor against the first attack on\r\nrecord of the Muhammadans.\r\n\r\nWhen Mahmud of Ghazni invaded Saurashtra and captured its capital,\r\nAnhilwara, he deposed its prince, and placed upon the throne, according\r\nto Ferishta, a prince of the former dynasty, renowned for his ancient\r\nline and purity of blood, and who is styled Dabichalima; a name which\r\nhas puzzled all European commentators. Now the Dabhi was a celebrated\r\ntribe, said by some to be a branch of the [103] Chawara, and this\r\ntherefore may be a compound of Dabhi Chawara, or the Chaurasima, by some\r\ncalled a branch of the ancient Yadus.[2.7.100]\r\n\r\nThis ancient connexion between the Suryavansi chiefs and the Chawaras,\r\nor Sauras, of Saurashtra, is still maintained after a lapse of more than\r\none thousand years; for although an alliance with the Rana’s family is\r\ndeemed the highest honour that a Hindu prince can obtain, as being the\r\nfirst in rank in Rajasthan, yet is the humble Chawara sought out, even\r\nat the foot of fortune’s ladder, whence to carry on the blood of Rama.\r\nThe present heir-apparent of a line of ‘one hundred kings,’ the prince\r\nJawān Singh [1828-38], is the offspring of a Chawara mother, the\r\ndaughter of a petty chieftain of Gujarat.\r\n\r\nIt were vain to give any account of the present state of the families\r\nbearing this name. They must depend upon the fame of past days; to this\r\nwe leave them.\r\n\r\n=Tāk or Takshak.=—Takshak appears to be the generic term of the race\r\nfrom which the various Scythic tribes, the early invaders of India,\r\nbranched off. It appears of more ancient application than Getae, which\r\nwas the parent of innumerable sakha. It might not be judicious to\r\nseparate them, though it would be speculative to say which was the\r\nprimitive title of the races called Scythic, after their country,\r\nSakatai or Sakadwipa, the land of the great Getae.\r\n\r\nAbulghazi makes Taunak[2.7.101] the son of Turk or Targetai, who appears\r\nto be the Turushka of the Puranas, the Tukyuks of the Chinese\r\nhistorians, the nomadic Tokhari of Strabo, who aided to overturn the\r\nGreek kingdom of Bactria, and gave their name to the grand division of\r\nAsia, Tokharistan[2.7.102] or Turkistan: and there is every appearance\r\nof that singular race, the Tajik,[2.7.103] still scattered over these\r\n[104] regions, and whose history appears a mystery, being the\r\ndescendants of the Takshak.\r\n\r\nIt has been already observed, that ancient inscriptions in the Pali or\r\nBuddhist character have been discovered in various parts of Rajasthan,\r\nof the race called Tasta, Takshak, and Tak, relating to the tribes, the\r\nMori [or Maurya], Pramara, their descendants. Naga and Takshak are\r\nsynonymous appellations in Sanskrit for the snake, and the Takshak is\r\nthe celebrated Nagvansa of the early heroic history of India. The\r\nMahabharata describes, in its usual allegorical style, the wars between\r\nthe Pandavas of Indraprastha and the Takshaks of the north. The\r\nassassination of Parikshita by the Takshak, and the exterminating\r\nwarfare carried on against them by his son and successor, Janamejaya,\r\nwho at last compelled them to sign tributary engagements, divested of\r\nits allegory,[2.7.104] is plain historical fact.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander invaded India, he found the Paraitakai, the mountain\r\n(_pahar_) Tak, inhabiting the Paropamisos range; nor is it by any means\r\nunlikely that Taxiles,[2.7.105] the ally of the Macedonian king, was the\r\nchief (_es_) of the Taks; and in the early history of the Bhatti princes\r\nof Jaisalmer, when driven from Zabulistan, they dispossessed the Taks on\r\nthe Indus, and established themselves in their land, the capital of\r\nwhich was called Salivahanpura; and as the date of this event is given\r\nas 3008 of the Yudhishthira era, it is by no means unlikely that\r\nSalivahana, or Salbhan (who was a Takshak), the conqueror of the Tuar\r\nVikrama, was of the very family dispossessed by the Bhattis, who\r\ncompelled them to migrate to the south.\r\n\r\nThe calculated period of the invasion of the Takshaks, or Nagvansa,\r\nunder Sheshnag, is about six or seven centuries before the Christian\r\nera, at which very [105] period the Scythic invasion of Egypt and Syria,\r\n“by the sons of Togarmah riding on horses” (the Aswas, or Asi), is alike\r\nrecorded by the prophet Ezekiel and Diodorus. The Abu Mahatma calls the\r\nTakshaks “the sons of Himachal,” all evincing Scythic descent; and it\r\nwas only eight reigns anterior to this change in the Lunar dynasties of\r\nIndia, that Parsvanath, the twenty-third Buddha [Jain Tirthankara],\r\nintroduced his tenets into India, and fixed his abode in the holy mount\r\nSarnet.[2.7.106]\r\n\r\nEnough of the ancient history of the Tak; we will now descend to more\r\nmodern times, on which we shall be brief. We have already mentioned the\r\nTakshak Mori [or Maurya] as being lords of Chitor from a very early\r\nperiod; and but a few generations after the Guhilots supplanted the\r\nMoris, this palladium of Hindu liberty was assailed by the arms of\r\nIslam. We find amongst the numerous defenders who appear to have\r\nconsidered the cause of Chitor their own, “the Tak from\r\nAsirgarh.”[2.7.107] This race appears to have retained possession of\r\nAsir for at least two centuries after this event, as its chieftain was\r\none of the most conspicuous leaders in the array of Prithwiraja. In the\r\npoems of Chand he is called the “standard-bearer, Tak of Asir.”[2.7.108]\r\n\r\nThis ancient race, the foe of Janamejaya and the friend of Alexander,\r\nclosed its career in a blaze of splendour. The celebrity of the kings of\r\nGujarat will make amends for the obscurity of the Taks of modern times,\r\nof whom a dynasty of fourteen kings followed each other in succession,\r\ncommencing and ending with the proud title of Muzaffar. It was in the\r\nreign of Muhammad,[2.7.109] son of the first Tughlak, that an accident\r\nto his nephew Firoz proved the dawn of the fortunes of the Tak;\r\npurchased, however, with the change of name and religion. Saharan the\r\nTak was the first apostate of his line, who, under the name of\r\nWajihu-l-mulk, concealed both his origin and tribe. His son, Zafar Khan,\r\nwas raised by his patron Firoz to the government of Gujarat, about the\r\nperiod when Timur invaded India. Zafar availed himself of the weakness\r\nof his master and the distraction of the times, and mounted the throne\r\nof Gujarat under the name of [106] Muzaffar.[2.7.110] He was\r\nassassinated by the hand of his grandson, Ahmad, who changed the ancient\r\ncapital, Anhilwara, for the city founded by himself, and called\r\nAhmadabad, one of the most splendid in the east. With the apostasy of\r\nthe Tak,[2.7.111] the name appears to have been obliterated from the\r\ntribes of Rajasthan; nor has my search ever discovered one of this name\r\nnow existing.\r\n\r\n=Jat, Jāt.=—In all the ancient catalogues of the thirty-six royal races\r\nof India the Jat has a place, though by none is he ever styled ‘Rajput’;\r\nnor am I aware of any instance of a Rajput’s intermarriage with a\r\nJat.[2.7.112] It is a name widely disseminated over India, though it\r\ndoes not now occupy a very elevated place amongst the inhabitants,\r\nbelonging chiefly to the agricultural classes.\r\n\r\nIn the Panjab they still retain their ancient name of Jat. On the Jumna\r\nand Ganges they are styled Jāts, of whom the chief of Bharatpur is the\r\nmost conspicuous. On the Indus and in Saurashtra they are termed Jats.\r\nThe greater portion of the husbandmen in Rajasthan are Jats; and there\r\nare numerous tribes beyond the Indus, now proselytes to the Muhammadan\r\nreligion, who derive their origin from this class.\r\n\r\nOf its ancient history sufficient has been already said. We will merely\r\nadd, that the kingdom of the great Getae, whose capital was on the\r\nJaxartes, preserved its integrity and name from the period of Cyrus to\r\nthe fourteenth century, when it was converted from idolatry to the faith\r\nof Islam. Herodotus [iv. 93-4] informs us that the Getae were theists\r\nand held the tenet of the soul’s immortality; and De Guignes,[2.7.113]\r\nfrom Chinese authorities, asserts that at a very early period they had\r\nembraced the religion of Fo or Buddha.\r\n\r\nThe traditions of the Jats claim the regions west of the Indus as the\r\ncradle of the race, and make them of Yadu extraction; thus corroborating\r\nthe annals of the Yadus, which state their migration from Zabulistan,\r\nand almost inducing us to [107] dispense with the descent of this tribe\r\nfrom Krishna, and to pronounce it an important colony of the Yueh-chi,\r\nYuti, or Jats. Of the first migration from Central Asia of this race\r\nwithin the Indus we have no record; it might have been simultaneous with\r\nthe Takshak, from the wars of Cyrus or his ancestors.\r\n\r\nIt has been already remarked that the Jat divided with the Takshak the\r\nclaim of being the parent name of the various tribes called Scythic,\r\ninvaders of India; and there is now before the author an inscription of\r\nthe fifth century applying both epithets to the same prince,[2.7.114]\r\nwho is invested moreover with the Scythic quality of worshipping the\r\nsun. It states, likewise, that the mother of this Jat prince was of Yadu\r\nrace: strengthening their claims to a niche amongst the thirty-six\r\nRajkulas, as well as their Yadu descent.\r\n\r\nThe fifth century of the Christian era, to which this inscription\r\nbelongs, is a period of interest in Jat history. De Guignes, from\r\noriginal authorities, states the Yueh-chi or Jats to have established\r\nthemselves in the Panjab in the fifth and sixth centuries, and the\r\ninscription now quoted applies to a prince whose capital is styled\r\nSalindrapura in these regions; and doubtless the Salivahanpur[2.7.115]\r\nwhere the Yadu Bhattis established themselves on the expulsion of the\r\nTak.\r\n\r\nHow much earlier than this the Jat penetrated into Rajasthan must be\r\nleft to more ancient inscriptions to determine: suffice it that in A.D.\r\n440 we find him in power.[2.7.116]\r\n\r\nWhen the Yadu was expelled from Salivahanpura, and forced to seek refuge\r\n[108] across the Sutlej among the Dahia and Johya Rajputs of the Indian\r\ndesert, where they founded their first capital, Derawar, many from\r\ncompulsion embraced the Muhammadan faith; on which occasion they assumed\r\nthe name of Jat,[2.7.117] of which at least twenty different offsets are\r\nenumerated in the Yadu chronicles.\r\n\r\nThat the Jats continued as a powerful community on the east bank of the\r\nIndus and in the Panjab, fully five centuries after the period our\r\ninscription and their annals illustrate, we have the most interesting\r\nrecords in the history of Mahmud, the conqueror of India, whose progress\r\nthey checked in a manner unprecedented in the annals of continental\r\nwarfare. It was in 416 of the Hegira (A.D. 1026) that Mahmud marched an\r\narmy against the Jats, who had harassed and insulted him on the return\r\nfrom his last expedition against Saurashtra. The interest of the account\r\nauthorizes its being given from the original.\r\n\r\n“The Jats inhabited the country on the borders of Multan, along the\r\nriver that runs by the mountains of Jud.[2.7.118] When Mahmud reached\r\nMultan, finding the Jat country defended by great rivers, he built\r\nfifteen hundred boats,[2.7.119] each armed with six iron spikes\r\nprojecting from their prows, to prevent their being boarded by the\r\nenemy, expert in this kind of warfare. In each boat he placed twenty\r\narchers, and some with fire-balls of naphtha to burn the Jat fleet. The\r\nmonarch having determined on their extirpation, awaited the result at\r\nMultan. The Jats sent their wives, children, and effects to Sind\r\nSagar,[2.7.120] and launched four thousand, or, as others say, eight\r\nthousand boats well armed to meet the Ghaznians. A terrible conflict\r\nensued, but the projecting spikes sunk the Jat boats while others were\r\nset on fire. Few escaped from this scene of terror; and those who did,\r\nmet with the more severe fate of captivity.”[2.7.121]\r\n\r\nMany doubtless did escape; and it is most probable that the Jat\r\ncommunities, on whose overthrow the State of Bikaner was founded, were\r\nremnants of this very warfare [109].\r\n\r\nNot long after this event the original empire of the Getae was\r\noverturned, when many fugitives found a refuge in India. In 1360\r\nTogultash Timur was the great Khan of the Getae nation; idolaters even\r\nto this period. He had conquered Khorasan, invaded Transoxiana (whose\r\nprince fled, but whose nephew, Amir Timur, averted its subjugation),\r\ngained the friendship of Togultash, and commanded a hundred thousand\r\nGetae warriors. In 1369, when the Getic Khan died, such was the\r\nascendancy obtained by Timur over his subjects, that the Kuriltai, or\r\ngeneral assembly, transferred the title of Grand Khan from the Getic to\r\nthe Chagatai Timur. In 1370 he married a Getic princess, and added\r\nKhokhand and Samarkand to his patrimony, Transoxiana. Rebellions and\r\nmassacres almost depopulated this nursery of mankind, ere the Getae\r\nabandoned their independence; nor was it till 1388, after six invasions,\r\nin which he burnt their towns, brought away their wealth, and almost\r\nannihilated the nation, that he felt himself secure.[2.7.122]\r\n\r\nIn his expedition into India, having overrun great part of Europe,\r\n“taken Moscow, and slain the soldiers of the barbarous Urus,” he\r\nencountered his old foes “the Getae, who inhabited the plains of Tohim,\r\nwhere he put two thousand to the sword, pursuing them into the desert\r\nand slaughtering many more near the Ghaggar.”[2.7.123]\r\n\r\nStill the Jat maintained himself in the Panjab, and the most powerful\r\nand independent prince of India at this day is the Jat prince of Lahore,\r\nholding dominion over the identical regions where the Yueh-chi colonized\r\nin the fifth century, and where the Yadus, driven from Ghazni,\r\nestablished themselves on the ruins of the Taks. The Jat cavalier\r\nretains a portion of his Scythic manners, and preserves the use of the\r\nchakra or discus, the weapon of the Yadu Krishna in the remote age of\r\nthe Bharat.\r\n\r\n=Hun or Hūn.=—Amongst the Scythic tribes who have secured for themselves\r\na niche with the thirty-six races of India, is the Hun. At what period\r\nthis race, so well known by its ravages and settlement in Europe,\r\ninvaded India, we know not.[2.7.124] Doubtless it was in the society of\r\nmany others yet found in the peninsula of [110] Saurashtra, as the\r\nKathi, the Bala, the Makwana, etc. It is, however, confined to the\r\ngenealogies of that peninsula; for although we have mention of the Hun\r\nin the chronicles and inscriptions of India at a very early period, he\r\nfailed to obtain a place in the catalogue of the northern bards.\r\n\r\nThe earliest notice of the tribe is in an inscription[2.7.125] recording\r\nthe power of a prince of Bihar, who, amidst his other conquests,\r\n“humbled the pride of the Huns.” In the annals of the early history of\r\nMewar, in the catalogue of princes who made common cause with this the\r\nchief of all the Rajputs, when Chitor was assailed in the first\r\nirruption of the Muhammadans, was Angatsi, lord of the Huns, who led his\r\nquota on this occasion. De Guignes[2.7.126] describes Angat as being the\r\nname of a considerable horde of Huns or Moguls; and Abulghazi says that\r\nthe Tartar tribe who guarded the great wall of China were termed\r\nAngatti, who had a distinct prince with high pay and honour. The\r\ncountries inhabited by the Hiong-nou and the Ou-huon, the Turks and\r\nMoguls, called ‘Tatar’ from Tatan,[2.7.127] the name of the country from\r\nthe banks of the Irtish along the mountains of Altai to the shores of\r\nthe Yellow Sea, are described at large by the historian of the Huns:\r\nfollowing whom and other original sources, the historian of the Fall of\r\nRome has given great interest to his narrative of their march into\r\nEurope. But those who are desirous to learn all that relates to the past\r\nhistory and manners of this people, must consult that monument of\r\nerudition and research, the Geography of Malte-Brun.[2.7.128]\r\n\r\nD’Anville,[2.7.129] quoting Cosmas the traveller, informs us that the\r\nWhite Huns (λευκοὶ Ούννοι)[2.7.130] occupied the north of India; and it\r\nis most probable a colony of these found their way into Saurashtra and\r\nMewar.\r\n\r\nIt is on the eastern bank of the Chambal, at the ancient Barolli, that\r\ntradition assigns a residence to the Hun; and one of the celebrated\r\ntemples at that place, called the Singar Chaori, is the marriage hall of\r\nthe Hun prince, who is also declared to have been possessed of a\r\nlordship on the opposite bank, occupying the [111] site of the present\r\ntown of Bhainsror. In the twelfth century the Hun must have possessed\r\nconsequence, to occupy the place he holds in the chronicle of the\r\nprinces of Gujarat. The race is not extinct. One of the most intelligent\r\nof the living bards of India assured the author of their existence; and\r\nin a tour where he accompanied him, redeemed his pledge, by pointing out\r\nthe residence of some in a village on the estuary of the Mahi, though\r\ndegraded and mixed with other classes.[2.7.131]\r\n\r\nWe may infer that few convulsions occurred in Central Asia, which drove\r\nforth these hordes of redundant population to seek subsistence in\r\nEurope, without India participating in such overflow. The only singular\r\ncircumstance is, by what means they came to be recognized as Hindus,\r\neven though of the lowest class. Sudra we cannot term them; for although\r\nthe Kathi and the Bala cannot be regarded as, or classed with Rajputs,\r\nthey would scorn the rank of Sudra.\r\n\r\n=Kāthi.=—Of the ancient notices of this people much has been already\r\nsaid, and all the genealogists, both of Rajasthan and Saurashtra, concur\r\nin assigning it a place amongst the royal races of India. It is one of\r\nthe most important tribes of the western peninsula, and which has\r\neffected the change of the name from Saurashtra to Kathiawar.\r\n\r\nOf all its inhabitants the Kathi retains most originality: his\r\nreligion, his manners, and his looks, all are decidedly Scythic. He\r\noccupied, in the time of Alexander, that nook of the Panjab near the\r\nconfluent five streams. It was against these Alexander marched in\r\nperson, when he nearly lost his life, and where he left such a signal\r\nmemorial of his vengeance. The Kathi can be traced from these scenes\r\nto his present haunts. In the earlier portion of the Annals of\r\nJaisalmer mention is made of their conflicts with the Kathi; and their\r\nown traditions[2.7.132] fix their settlement in the peninsula from the\r\nsouth-eastern part of the valley of the Indus, about the eighth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth century the Kathi were conspicuous in the wars with\r\nPrithwiraja, there being several leaders of the tribe attached to his\r\narmy, as well as to that of [112] his rival, the monarch of\r\nKanauj.[2.7.133] Though on this occasion they acted in some degree of\r\nsubservience to the monarch of Anhilwara, it would seem that this was\r\nmore voluntary than forced.\r\n\r\nThe Kathi still adores the sun,[2.7.134] scorns the peaceful arts, and\r\nis much less contented with the tranquil subsistence of industry than\r\nthe precarious earnings of his former predatory pursuits. The Kathi was\r\nnever happy but on horseback, collecting his blackmail, lance in hand,\r\nfrom friend and foe.\r\n\r\nWe will conclude this brief sketch with Captain Macmurdo’s character of\r\nthis race. “The Kathi differs in some respects from the Rajput. He is\r\nmore cruel in his disposition, but far exceeds him in the virtue of\r\nbravery;[2.7.135] and a character possessed of more energy than a Kathi\r\ndoes not exist. His size is considerably larger than common, often\r\nexceeding six feet. He is sometimes seen with light hair and\r\nblue-coloured eyes. His frame is athletic and bony, and particularly\r\nwell adapted to his mode of life. His countenance is expressive, but of\r\nthe worst kind, being harsh, and often destitute of a single mild\r\nfeature.”[2.7.136]\r\n\r\n=Bāla.=—All the genealogists, ancient and modern, insert the Bala tribe\r\namongst the Rajkulas. The birad, or ‘blessing,’ of the bard is _Tatta\r\nMultan ka rao_,[2.7.137] indicative of their original abodes on the\r\nIndus. They lay claim, however, to descent from the Suryavansi, and\r\nmaintain that their great ancestor, Bala or Bapa, was the offspring of\r\nLava, the eldest son of Rama; that their first settlement in Saurashtra\r\nwas at the ancient Dhank, in more remote periods called Mungi Paithan;\r\nand that, in conquering the country adjacent, they termed it Balakshetra\r\n(their capital Valabhipura), and assumed the title of Balarae. Here they\r\nclaim identity with the Guhilot race of Mewar: nor is it impossible that\r\nthey may be a branch of this family, which long held power in\r\nSaurashtra.[2.7.138] Before the Guhilots adopted the worship of Mahadeo,\r\nwhich period is indicated in their annals, the chief object of their\r\nadoration was the sun, giving them that Scythic resemblance to which the\r\nBalas have every appearance of claim [113].\r\n\r\nThe Balas on the continent of Saurashtra, on the contrary, assert their\r\norigin to be Induvansa, and that they are the Balakaputras who were the\r\nancient lords of Aror on the Indus. It would be presumption to decide\r\nbetween these claims; but I would venture to surmise that they might be\r\nthe offspring of Salya, one of the princes of the Mahabharata, who\r\nfounded Aror.\r\n\r\nThe Kathis claim descent from the Balas: an additional proof of northern\r\norigin, and strengthening their right to the epithet of the bards,\r\n‘Lords of Multan and Tatta.’ The Balas were of sufficient consequence in\r\nthe thirteenth century to make incursions on Mewar, and the first\r\nexploit of the celebrated Rana Hamir was his killing the Bala chieftain\r\nof Chotila.[2.7.139] The present chief of Dhank is a Bala, and the tribe\r\nyet preserves importance in the peninsula.\r\n\r\n=Jhāla Makwāna.=—This tribe also inhabits the Saurashtra peninsula. It\r\nis styled Rajput, though neither classed with the Solar, Lunar, nor\r\nAgnikula races; but though we cannot directly prove it, we have every\r\nright to assign to it a northern origin. It is a tribe little known in\r\nHindustan or even Rajasthan, into which latter country it was introduced\r\nentirely through the medium of the ancient lords of Saurashtra, the\r\npresent family of Mewar; a sanction which covers every defect. A\r\nsplendid act of self-devotion of the Jhala chief, when Rana Partap was\r\noppressed with the whole weight of Akbar’s power, obtained, with the\r\ngratitude of this prince, the highest honours he could confer,—his\r\ndaughter in marriage, and a seat on his right hand. That it was the act,\r\nand not his rank in the scale of the thirty-six tribes, which gained him\r\nthis distinction, we have decided proof in later times, when it was\r\ndeemed a mark of great condescension that the present Rana should\r\nsanction a remote branch of his own family bestowing a daughter in\r\nmarriage on the Jhala ruler of Kotah.[2.7.140] This tribe has given its\r\nname to one of the largest divisions of Saurashtra, Jhalawar, which\r\npossesses several towns of importance. Of these Bankaner, Halwad, and\r\nDhrangadra are the principal.\r\n\r\nRegarding the period of the settlement of the Jhalas tradition is\r\nsilent, as also on their early history: but the aid of its quota was\r\ngiven to the Rana against the [114] first attacks of the Muhammadans;\r\nand in the heroic history of Prithwiraja we have ample and repeated\r\nmention of the Jhala chieftains who distinguished themselves in his\r\nservice, as well as in that of his antagonist, and the name of one of\r\nthese, as recorded by the bard Chand, I have seen inscribed on the\r\ngranite rock of the sacred Girnar, near their primitive abodes, where we\r\nleave them. There are several subdivisions of the Jhala, of which the\r\nMakwana is the principal.\r\n\r\n=Jethwa, Jaithwa, Kamāri.=—This is an ancient tribe, and by all\r\nauthorities styled Rajput; though, like the Jhala, little known out of\r\nSaurashtra, to one of the divisions of which it has given its name,\r\nJethwar. Its present possessions are on the western coast of the\r\npeninsula: the residence of its prince, who is styled Rana, is\r\nPorbandar.\r\n\r\nIn remote times their capital was Ghumli, whose ruins attest\r\nconsiderable power, and afford singular scope for analogy, in\r\narchitectural device, with the style termed Saxon of Europe.[2.7.141]\r\nThe bards of the Jethwas run through a long list of one hundred and\r\nthirty crowned heads, and in the eighth century have chronicled the\r\nmarriage of their prince with the Tuar refounder of Delhi. At this\r\nperiod the Jethwa bore the name of Kamar; and Sahl Kamar is reported to\r\nbe the prince who was driven from Ghumli, in the twelfth century, by\r\ninvaders from the north. With this change the name of Kamar was sunk,\r\nand that of Jethwa assumed, which has induced the author to style them\r\nKamari;[2.7.142] and as they, with the other inhabitants of this\r\npeninsula, have all the appearance of Scythic descent, urging no\r\npretensions to connexion with the ancient races of India, they may be a\r\nbranch of that celebrated race, the Cimmerii of higher Asia, and the\r\nCimbri of Europe.\r\n\r\nTheir legends are as fabulous as fanciful. They trace their descent from\r\nthe monkey-god Hanuman, and confirm it by alleging the elongation of the\r\nspine of their princes, who bear the epithet of Puncharia, or the\r\n‘long-tailed,’ Ranas of Saurashtra. But the manners and traditions of\r\nthis race will appear more fully in the narrative of the author’s\r\ntravels amongst them.\r\n\r\n=Gohil.=[2.7.143]—This was a distinguished race: it claims to be\r\nSuryavansi, and with some pretension. The first residence of the Gohils\r\nwas Juna Khergarh, near the bend of the Luni in Marwar.[2.7.144] How\r\nlong they had been established here we know not. They took it from one\r\nof the aboriginal Bhil chiefs named Kherwa, and had been in possession\r\nof it for twenty generations when expelled by the [115] Rathors at the\r\nend of the twelfth century. Thence migrating to Saurashtra, they fixed\r\nat Piramgarh;[2.7.145] which being destroyed, one branch settled at\r\nBhagwa, and the chief marrying the daughter of Nandanagar or\r\nNandod,[2.7.146] he usurped or obtained his father-in-law’s estates; and\r\ntwenty-seven generations are enumerated, from Sompal to Narsingh, the\r\npresent Raja of Nandod. Another branch fixed at Sihor, and thence\r\nfounded Bhaunagar and Gogha. The former town, on the gulf of the Mahi,\r\nis the residence of the Gohils, who have given their name, Gohilwar, to\r\nthe eastern portion of the peninsula of Saurashtra. The present chief\r\naddicts himself to commerce, and possesses ships which trade to the gold\r\ncoast of Sofala.\r\n\r\n=Sarwaiya or Sariaspa.=—Of this race tradition has left us only the\r\nknowledge that it once was famous; for although, in the catalogues of\r\nthe bard, it is introduced as the “essence of the Khatri race,”[2.7.147]\r\nwe have only a few legends regarding its present degradation. Its name,\r\nas well as this epithet of the bard, induces a belief that it is a\r\nbranch of the Aswas, with the prefix of _sar_, denoting ‘essence,’ or\r\npriority. But it is useless to speculate on a name.\r\n\r\n=Silār or Salār.=—Like the former, we have here but the shade of a name;\r\nthough one which, in all probability, originated the epithet Larike, by\r\nwhich the Saurashtra peninsula was known to Ptolemy and the geographers\r\nof early Europe. The tribe of Lar was once famous in Saurashtra, and in\r\nthe annals of Anhilwara mention is made of Siddharaja Jayasingha having\r\nextirpated them throughout his dominions. Salar, or Silar, would\r\ntherefore be distinctively _the_ Lar.[2.7.148] Indeed, the author of the\r\nKumarpal Charitra styles it Rajtilak, or ‘regal prince’; but the name\r\nonly now exists amongst the mercantile classes professing the faith of\r\nBuddha [Jainism]: it is inserted as one of the eighty-four. The greater\r\nportion of these are of Rajput origin.\r\n\r\n=Dabhi.=—Little can be said of this tribe but that it was once\r\ncelebrated in Saurashtra. By some it is called the branch of the Yadu,\r\nthough all the genealogists give it distinct importance. It now\r\npossesses neither territory nor numbers.[2.7.149]\r\n\r\n=Gaur.=—The Gaur tribe was once respected in Rajasthan, though it never\r\nthere attained to any considerable eminence. The ancient kings of Bengal\r\nwere of this race, and gave their name to the capital, Lakhnauti [116].\r\n\r\nWe have every reason to believe that they were possessors of the land\r\nafterwards occupied by the Chauhans, as they are styled in all the old\r\nchronicles the ‘Gaur of Ajmer.’ Repeated mention is made of them in the\r\nwars of Prithwiraja, as leaders of considerable renown, one of whom\r\nformed a small State in the centre of India, which survived through\r\nseven centuries of Mogul domination, till it at length fell a prey\r\nindirectly to the successes of the British over the Mahrattas, when\r\nSindhia in 1809 annihilated the power of the Gaur and took possession of\r\nhis capital, Sheopur.[2.7.150] A petty district, yielding about £5000\r\nannually, is all this rapacious head of a predatory government has left\r\nto the Gaur, out of about twelve lacs of annual revenue. The Gaur has\r\nfive sakha: Untahar, Silhala, Tur, Dusena, and Budana.[2.7.151]\r\n\r\n=Dor or Doda.=—We have little to say of this race. Though occupying a\r\nplace in all the genealogies, time has destroyed all knowledge of the\r\npast history of a tribe, to gain a victory over whom was deemed by\r\nPrithwiraja worthy of a tablet.[2.7.152]\r\n\r\n=Gaharwār.=—The Gaharwar Rajput is scarcely known to his brethren in\r\nRajasthan, who will not admit his contaminated blood to mix with theirs;\r\nthough, as a brave warrior, he is entitled to their fellowship. The\r\noriginal country of the Gaharwar is in the ancient kingdom of\r\nKasi.[2.7.153] Their great ancestor was Khortaj Deva, from whom\r\nJasaunda, the seventh in descent, in consequence of some grand\r\nsacrificial rites performed at Vindhyavasi, gave the title of Bundela to\r\nhis issue. Bundela has now usurped the name of Gaharwar, and become the\r\nappellation of the immense tract which its various branches inhabit in\r\nBundelkhand, on the ruins of the Chandelas, whose chief cities,\r\nKalanjar, Mohini, and Mahoba, they took possession of.[2.7.154]\r\n\r\n=Chandel.=—The Chandela, classed by some of the genealogists amongst the\r\nthirty-six tribes, were powerful in the twelfth century, possessing the\r\nwhole of the regions between [117] the Jumna and Nerbudda, now occupied\r\nby the Bundelas and Baghelas. Their wars with Prithwiraja, forming one\r\nof the most interesting of his exploits, ended in the humiliation of the\r\nChandela, and prepared the way for their conquest by the Gaharwars; the\r\ndate of the supremacy of the Bundela Manvira was about A.D. 1200.\r\nMadhukar Sah, the thirteenth in descent from him, founded Orchha on the\r\nBetwa, by whose son, Birsingh Deva, considerable power was attained.\r\nOrchha became the chief of the numerous Bundela principalities; but its\r\nfounder drew upon himself everlasting infamy, by putting to death the\r\nwise Abu-l Fazl,[2.7.155] the historian and friend of the magnanimous\r\nAkbar, and the encomiast and advocate of the Hindu race.\r\n\r\nFrom the period of Akbar the Bundelas bore a distinguished part in all\r\nthe grand conflicts, to the very close of the monarchy: nor, amongst all\r\nthe brave chiefs of Rajasthan, did any perform more gallant or faithful\r\nservices than the Bundela chieftains of Orchha and Datia. Bhagwan of\r\nOrchha commanded the advanced guard of the army of Shah Jahan. His son,\r\nSubhkarana, was Aurangzeb’s most distinguished leader in the Deccan, and\r\nDalpat fell in the war of succession on the plains of Jajau.[2.7.156]\r\nHis descendants have not degenerated; nor is there anything finer in the\r\nannals of the chivalry of the West, than the dignified and heroic\r\nconduct of the father of the present chief.[2.7.157] The Bundela is now\r\na numerous race, while the name Gaharwar remains in their original\r\nhaunts.\r\n\r\n=Bargūjar.=—This race is Suryavansi, and the only one, with the\r\nexception of the Guhilot, which claims from Lava, the elder son of Rama.\r\nThe Bargujar held considerable possessions in Dhundhar,[2.7.158] and\r\ntheir capital was the hill fortress of Rajor[2.7.159] in the\r\nprincipality of Macheri. Rajgarh and Alwar were also their [118]\r\npossessions. The Bargujars were expelled these abodes by the Kachhwahas.\r\nA colony found refuge and a new residence at Anupshahr on the Ganges.\r\n\r\n=Sengar.=—Of this tribe little is known, nor does it appear ever to have\r\nobtained great celebrity. The sole chieftainship of the Sengars is\r\nJagmohanpur on the Jumna.[2.7.160]\r\n\r\n=Sakarwāl.=—This tribe, like the former, never appears to have claimed\r\nmuch notice amidst the princes of Rajasthan; nor is there a single\r\nindependent chieftain now remaining, although there is a small district\r\ncalled after them, Sakarwar, on the right bank of the Chambal, adjoining\r\nJaduvati, and like it now incorporated in the province of Gwalior, in\r\nSindhia’s dominions. The Sakarwal is therefore reduced to subsist by\r\ncultivation, or the more precarious employment of his lance, either as a\r\nfollower of others, or as a common depredator. They have their name from\r\nthe town of Sikri (Fatehpur), which was formerly an independent\r\nprincipality.[2.7.161]\r\n\r\n=Bais.=—The Bais has obtained a place amongst the thirty-six races,\r\nthough the author believes it but a subdivision of the Suryavansi, as it\r\nis neither to be met with in the lists of Chand, nor in those of the\r\nKumarpal Charitra. It is now numerous, and has given its name to an\r\nextensive district, Baiswara in the Duab, or the land between the Ganges\r\nand Jumna.[2.7.162]\r\n\r\n=Dahia.=—This is an ancient tribe, whose residence was the banks of the\r\nIndus, near its confluence with the Sutlej; and although they retain a\r\nplace amongst the thirty-six royal races, we have not the knowledge of\r\nany as now existing. They are mentioned in the annals of the Bhattis of\r\nJaisalmer, and from name as well as from locale, we may infer that they\r\nwere the Dahae of Alexander.[2.7.163]\r\n\r\n=Joiya, Johya.=—This race possessed the same haunts as the Dahia, and\r\nare always coupled with them. They, however, extended across the Ghara\r\ninto the northern desert of India, and in ancient chronicles are\r\nentitled ‘Lords of Jangaldesa,’ a tract which comprehended Hariana,\r\nBhatner, and Nagor. The author possesses a work relative to this tribe,\r\nlike the Dahia, now extinct.[2.7.164]\r\n\r\n=Mohil.=—We have no mode of judging of the pretensions of this race to\r\nthe place it is allowed to occupy by the genealogists. All that can be\r\nlearned of its past history is, that it inhabited a considerable tract\r\nso late as the foundation of the present State of Bikaner, the Rathor\r\nfounders of which expelled, if not extirpated, the Mohil. With the\r\nMalan, Malani, and Mallia, also extinct, it may [119] claim the honour\r\nof descent from the ancient Malloi, the foes of Alexander, whose abode\r\nwas Multan. (_Qu._ Mohilthan?)[2.7.165]\r\n\r\n=Nikumbha.=—Of this race, to which celebrity attaches in all the\r\ngenealogies, we can only discover that they were proprietors of the\r\ndistrict of Mandalgarh prior to the Guhilots.[2.7.166]\r\n\r\n=Rājpāli.=—It is difficult to discover anything regarding this race,\r\nwhich, under the names of Rajpali, Rajpalaka, or simply Pala, are\r\nmentioned by all the genealogists; especially those of Saurashtra, to\r\nwhich in all probability it was confined. This tends to make it Scythic\r\nin origin; the conclusion is strengthened by the derivation of the name,\r\nmeaning ‘royal shepherd’: it was probably a branch of the ancient\r\nPali.[2.7.167]\r\n\r\n=Dahariya.=—The Kumarpal Charitra is our sole authority for classing\r\nthis race with the thirty-six. Of its history we know nothing. Amongst\r\nthe princes who came to the aid of Chitor, when first assailed by the\r\narms of Islam, was ‘the lord of Debal, Dahir, Despati.’[2.7.168] From\r\nthe ignorance of the transcriber of the Guhilot annals, _Delhi_ is\r\nwritten instead of _Debal_; but we not only have the whole of the names\r\nof the Tuar race, but Delhi was not in existence at this time. Slight as\r\nis the mention of this prince in the Chitor annals, it is nevertheless\r\nof high value, as stamping them with authenticity; for this Dahir was\r\nactually the despot of Sind, whose tragical end in his capital Debal is\r\nrelated by Abu-l Fazl. It was in the ninety-ninth year of the Hegira\r\nthat he was attacked by Muhammad bin Kasim, the lieutenant of the Caliph\r\nof Bagdad, and treated with the greatest barbarity.[2.7.169] Whether\r\nthis prince used Dahir as a proper name, or as that of his tribe, must\r\nbe left to conjecture.\r\n\r\n=Dahima.=—The Dahima has left but the wreck of a great name.[2.7.170]\r\nSeven centuries have swept away all recollection of a tribe who once\r\nafforded one of the proudest themes for the song of the bard. The Dahima\r\nwas the lord of Bayana, and one of the most powerful vassals of the\r\nChauhan emperor, Prithwiraja. Three brothers of this house held the\r\nhighest offices under this monarch, and the period during which the\r\nelder, Kaimas, was his minister, was the brightest in the history of the\r\nChauhan: but he fell a victim to a blind jealousy. Pundir, the second\r\nbrother [120], commanded the frontier at Lahore. The third, Chawand Rae,\r\nwas the principal leader in the last battle, where Prithwiraja fell,\r\nwith the whole of his chivalry, on the banks of the Ghaggar. Even the\r\nhistorians of Shihabu-d-din have preserved the name of the gallant\r\nDahima, Chawand Rae, whom they style Khandirai; and to whose valour,\r\nthey relate, Shihabu-d-din himself nearly fell a sacrifice. With the\r\nChauhan, the race seems to have been extinguished. Rainsi, his only son,\r\nwas by this sister of Chawand Rae, but he did not survive the capture of\r\nDelhi. This marriage forms the subject of one of the books of the bard,\r\nwho never was more eloquent than in the praise of the Dahima.[2.7.171]\r\n\r\n                       ABORIGINAL RACES[2.7.172]\r\n\r\nBagri, Mer, Kaba, Mina, Bhil, Sahariya, Thori, Khangar, Gond, Bhar,\r\nJanwar, and Sarad.\r\n\r\n                    AGRICULTURAL AND PASTORAL TRIBES\r\n\r\nAbhira or Ahir, Goala, Kurmi or Kulumbi, Gujar, and Jat\r\n\r\n              RAJPUT TRIBES TO WHICH NO SAKHA IS ASSIGNED\r\n\r\nJalia, Peshani, Sohagni, Chahira, Ran, Simala, Botila, Gotchar, Malan,\r\nUhir, Hul, Bachak, Batar, Kerach, Kotak, Busa, and Bargota.\r\n\r\n             CATALOGUE OF THE EIGHTY-FOUR MERCANTILE TRIBES\r\n\r\nSri Sri Mal, Srimal, Oswal, Bagherwal, Dindu, Pushkarwal, Mertawal,\r\nHarsora, Surawal, Piliwal, Bhambu, Kandhelwal, Dohalwal, Kederwal,\r\nDesawal, Gujarwal, Sohorwal, Agarwal, Jaelwal, Manatwal, Kajotiwal,\r\nKortawal, Chehtrawal, Soni, Sojatwal, Nagar, Mad, Jalhera, Lar, Kapol,\r\nKhareta, Barari, Dasora, Bambarwal, Nagadra, Karbera, Battewara, Mewara,\r\nNarsinghpura, Khaterwal, Panchamwal, Hanerwal, Sirkera, Bais, Stukhi,\r\nKambowal, Jiranwal, Baghelwal, Orchitwal, Bamanwal, Srigur, Thakurwal,\r\nBalmiwal, Tepora, Tilota, Atbargi, Ladisakha, Badnora, Khicha, Gasora,\r\nBahaohar, Jemo, Padmora, Maharia, Dhakarwal, Mangora, Goelwal, Mohorwal,\r\nChitora, Kakalia, Bhareja, Andora, Sachora, Bhungrawal, Mandahala,\r\nBramania, Bagria, Dindoria, Borwal, Sorbia, Orwal, Nuphag, and Nagora.\r\n(One wanting.)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.1:\r\n\r\n  [This catalogue is now of historical or traditional, rather than of\r\n  ethnographical value.

Again,\r\n  with many of the tribes of the desert, the _s_ is alike a\r\n  stumbling-block, which causes many singular mistakes, when Jaisalmer,\r\n  the ‘hill of Jaisal,’ becomes Jahlmer, ‘the hill of fools.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.97:\r\n\r\n  [The Balhara of Arab travellers of the tenth century were the\r\n  Rashtrakūta dynasty of Mālkhed, Balhara being a corruption of\r\n  Vallabharāja, Vallabha being the royal title (_BG_, i.

Much of the\r\n  account is mere tradition, but it has been plausibly suggested that\r\n  when Bhīma I., the Chaulukya king of Anhilwāra was defeated by Mahmūd\r\n  of Ghazni in A.D. 1024, the latter may have appointed Durlabha, uncle\r\n  of Bhīma, to keep order in Gujarāt, and that the two Dābshalīms may be\r\n  identified with Durlabha and his son (_BG_, i. Part i. 168). Also see\r\n  Ferishta i. 76; Bayley, _Muhammadan Dynasties of Gujarāt_, 32 ff.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.101:\r\n\r\n  Abulghazi [_Hist. of the Turks, Moguls, and Tartars_, 1730, i. 5 f.]\r\n  says, when Noah left the ark he divided the earth amongst his three\r\n  sons: Shem had Iran: Japhet, the country of ‘Kuttup Shamach,’ the name\r\n  of the regions between the Caspian Sea and India. There he lived two\r\n  hundred and fifty years. He left eight sons, of whom Turk was the\r\n  elder and the seventh Camari, supposed the Gomer of Scripture. Turk\r\n  had four sons; the eldest of whom was Taunak, the fourth from whom was\r\n  Mogul, a corruption of Mongol, signifying _sad_, whose successors made\r\n  the Jaxartes their winter abode. [The word means ‘brave’ (Howorth,\r\n  _Hist. of the Mongols_, i. 27).] Under his reign no trace of the true\r\n  religion remained: idolatry reigned everywhere. Aghuz Khan succeeded.\r\n  The ancient Cimbri, who went west with Odin’s horde of Jats, Chattis,\r\n  and Su, were probably the tribes descended from Camari, the son of\r\n  Turk.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.102:\r\n\r\n  Tacash continued to be a proper name with the great Khans of Khārizm\r\n  (Chorasmia) until they adopted the faith of Muhammad. The father of\r\n  Jalal, the foe of Jenghiz Khan, was named Tacash. Tashkent on the\r\n  Jaxartes, the capital of Turkistan, may be derived from the name of\r\n  the race. Bayer says, “Tocharistan was the region of the Tochari, who\r\n  were the ancient Τώχαροι (Tochari), or Τάχαροι (Tacharoi).” Ammianus\r\n  Marcellinus says, “many nations obey the Bactrians, whom the Tochari\r\n  surpass” (_Hist. Reg. Bact._ p. 7).\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.103:\r\n\r\n  This singular race, the Tajiks, are repeatedly mentioned by Mr.\r\n  Elphinstone in his admirable account of the kingdom of Kabul. They are\r\n  also particularly noticed as monopolising the commercial transactions\r\n  of the kingdom of Bokhara, in that interesting work, _Voyage\r\n  d’Orenbourg à Bokhara_, the map accompanying which, for the first\r\n  time, lays down authentically the sources and course of the Oxus and\r\n  Jaxartes. [The term Tājik means the settled population, as opposed to\r\n  the Turks or tent-dwellers. It is the same word as Tāzi, ‘Arab,’ still\r\n  surviving in the name of the Persian greyhound, which was apparently\r\n  introduced by the Arabs. Sykes (_Hist. of Persia_, ii. 153, note) and\r\n  Skrine-Ross (_The Heart of Asia_, 3, 364 note) state that the Tājiks\r\n  represent the Iranian branch of the Aryans.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.104:\r\n\r\n  The Mahabharata describes this warfare against the snakes literally:\r\n  of which, in one attack, he seized and made a burnt-offering (hom) of\r\n  twenty thousand. It is surprising that the Hindu will accept these\r\n  things literally. It might be said he had but a choice of\r\n  difficulties, and that it would be as impossible for any human being\r\n  to make the barbarous sacrifice of twenty thousand of his species, as\r\n  it would be difficult to find twenty thousand snakes for the purpose.\r\n  The author’s knowledge of what barbarity will inflict leaves the fact\r\n  of the human sacrifice, though not perhaps to this extent, not even\r\n  improbable. In 1811 his duties called him to a survey amidst the\r\n  ravines of the Chambal, the tract called Gujargarh, a district\r\n  inhabited by the Gujar tribe. Turbulent and independent, like the sons\r\n  of Esau, their hand against every man and every man’s hand against\r\n  them, their nominal prince, Surajmall, the Jāt chief of Bharatpur,\r\n  pursued exactly the same plan towards the population of these\r\n  villages, whom they captured in a night attack, that Janamejaya did to\r\n  the Takshaks: he threw them into pits with combustibles, and actually\r\n  thus consumed them! This occurred not three-quarters of a century ago.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.105:\r\n\r\n  Arrian says that his name was Omphis [Āmbhi], and that his father\r\n  dying at this time, he did homage to Alexander, who invested him with\r\n  the title and estates of his father Taxiles. Hence, perhaps (from\r\n  _Tak_), the name of the Indus, _Attak_; [?] not _Atak_, or\r\n  ‘forbidden,’ according to modern signification, and which has only\r\n  been given since the Muhammadan religion for a time made it the\r\n  boundary between the two faiths. [All these speculations are\r\n  valueless.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.106:\r\n\r\n  In Bihar, during the reign of Pradyota, the successor of Ripunjaya.\r\n  Parsva’s symbol is the serpent of Takshak. His doctrines spread to the\r\n  remotest parts of India, and the princes of Valabhipura of Mandor and\r\n  Anhilwara all held to the tenets of Buddha. [As usual, Jains are\r\n  confounded with Buddhists. There is no reason to believe that the\r\n  Nāgas, a serpent-worshipping tribe, were not indigenous in India.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.107:\r\n\r\n  This is the celebrated fortress in Khandesh, now in the possession of\r\n  the British.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.108:\r\n\r\n  In the list of the wounded at the battle of Kanauj he is mentioned by\r\n  name, as “Chatto the Tak.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.109:\r\n\r\n  He reigned from A.D. 1324 to 1351.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.110:\r\n\r\n  ‘The victorious’ [see p. 118 above].\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.111:\r\n\r\n  The _Mirātu-l-Sikandari_ gives the ancestry of the apostate for\r\n  twenty-three generations; the last of whom was Sesh, the same which\r\n  introduced the Nagvansa, seven centuries before the Christian era,\r\n  into India. The author of the work gives the origin of the name of\r\n  Tak, or Tank, from _tarka_, ‘expulsion,’ from his caste, which he\r\n  styles Khatri, evincing his ignorance of this ancient race.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.112:\r\n\r\n  [Though apparently there is no legal connubium between Jāts and\r\n  Rājputs, the two tribes are closely connected, and it has been\r\n  suggested that both had their origin in invaders from Central Asia,\r\n  the leaders becoming Rājputs, the lower orders Jāt peasants.

Of the race of\r\n  _Jat Kathida_, whose ancestor, the warrior Takshak, formed the garland\r\n  on the neck of Mahadeva.\" Though this is a figurative allusion to the\r\n  snake necklace of the father of creation, yet it evidently pointed to\r\n  the Jat’s descent from the Takshak. But enough has been said elsewhere\r\n  of the snake race, the parent of the Scythic tribes, which the divine\r\n  Milton seems to have taken from Diodorus’s account of the mother of\r\n  the Scythac:\r\n\r\n                “Woman to the waist, and fair;\r\n                But ended foul in many a scaly fold!”\r\n                          _Paradise Lost_, Book ii. 650 f.\r\n\r\n  Whether the _Jat Kathida_ is the Jat or Getae of Cathay (_da_ being\r\n  the mark of the genitive case) we will leave to conjecture [?]. [Ney\r\n  Elias (_History of the Moghuls of Central Asia_, 75) suggests that the\r\n  theory of the connexion between Jāts and Getae was largely based on an\r\n  error regarding the term _jatah_, ‘rascal,’ applied as a mark of\r\n  reproach to the Moguls by the Chagatai.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.115:\r\n\r\n  This place existed in the twelfth century as a capital; since an\r\n  inscription of Kamarpal, prince of Anhilwara, declares that this\r\n  monarch carried his conquests “even to Salpur.” There is Sialkot in\r\n  Rennell’s geography, and Wilford mentions “Sangala, a famous city in\r\n  ruins, sixty miles west by north of Lahore, situated in a forest, and\r\n  said to be built by Puru.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.116:\r\n\r\n  At this time (A.D. 449) the Jut brothers, Hengist and Horsa, led a\r\n  colony from Jutland and founded the kingdom of Kent (_qu._ _Kantha_,\r\n  ‘a coast,’ in Sanskrit, as in Gothic _Konta_?). The laws they there\r\n  introduced, more especially the still prevailing one of gavelkind,\r\n  where all the sons share equally, except the youngest who has a double\r\n  portion, are purely Scythic, and brought by the original Goth from the\r\n  Jaxartes. Alaric had finished his career, and Theodoric and Genseric\r\n  (_ric_, ‘king,’ in Sanskrit [?]) were carrying their arms into Spain\r\n  and Africa. [These speculations are valueless.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.117:\r\n\r\n  Why should these proselytes, if originally Yadu, assume the name of\r\n  Jat or Jāt? It must be either that the Yadus were themselves the\r\n  Scythic Yuti or Yueh-chi, or that the branches intermarried with the\r\n  Jats, and consequently became degraded as Yadus, and the mixed issue\r\n  bore the name of the mother.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.118:\r\n\r\n  The Jadu ka Dang, ‘or hills of Yadu,’ mentioned in the sketch of this\r\n  race as one of their intermediate points of halt when they were driven\r\n  from India after the Mahabharata.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.119:\r\n\r\n  Near the spot where Alexander built his fleet, which navigated to\r\n  Babylon thirteen hundred years before.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.120:\r\n\r\n  Translated by Dow, ‘an island.’ Sind Sagar is one of the Duabas of the\r\n  Panjab.

The Dahima had three\r\n  sons and two fair daughters: may his name be perpetuated throughout\r\n  this iron age! One daughter was married to the Lord of Mewat, the\r\n  other to the Chauhan. With her he gave in dower eight beauteous\r\n  damsels and sixty-three female slaves, one hundred chosen horses of\r\n  the breed of Irak, two elephants, and ten shields, a pallet of silver\r\n  for the bride, one hundred wooden images, one hundred chariots, and\r\n  one thousand pieces of gold.” The bard, on taking leave, says: “the\r\n  Dahima lavished his gold, and filled his coffers with the praises of\r\n  mankind. The Dahimi produced a jewel, a gem without price, the Prince\r\n  Rainsi.”\r\n\r\n  The author here gives a fragment of the ruins of Bayana, the ancient\r\n  abode of the Dahima.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.7.172:\r\n\r\n  [Many names in the following list are not capable of identification,\r\n  and their correct form is uncertain. Those of the mercantile tribes\r\n  are largely groups confined to Rājputāna.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 8\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus taken a review of the tribes which at various times\r\ninhabited and still inhabit Hindustan, the subject must be concluded.\r\n\r\nIn so extensive a field it was impossible to introduce all that could\r\nhave been advanced on the distinctive marks in religion and manners; but\r\nthis deficiency will be remedied in the annals of the most prominent\r\nraces yet ruling, by which we shall prevent repetition.\r\n\r\nThe same religion governing the institutions of all these tribes\r\noperates to counteract that dissimilarity in manners, which would\r\nnaturally be expected amidst so great a variety, from situation or\r\nclimate; although such causes do produce a material difference in\r\nexternal habit. Cross but the elevated range which divides upland Mewar\r\nfrom the low sandy region of Marwar, and the difference of costume and\r\nmanners will strike the most casual observer. But these changes are only\r\nexterior and personal; the mental character is less changed, because the\r\nsame creed, the same religion (the principal former and reformer of\r\nmanners), guides them all.\r\n\r\n=Distinctions between the Rājput States.=—We have the same mythology,\r\nthe same theogony, the same festivals, though commemorated with peculiar\r\ndistinctions. There are niceties in thought, as in dress, which if\r\npossible to communicate would excite but little interest; when the tie\r\nof a turban and the fold of a robe are, like Masonic symbols,\r\ndistinguishing badges of tribes. But it is in their domestic circle that\r\nmanners are best seen [122]; where restraint is thrown aside, and no\r\nauthority controls the freedom of expression. But does the European seek\r\naccess to this sanctum of nationality ere he gives his debtor and\r\ncreditor account of character, his balanced catalogue of virtues and\r\nvices? He may, however, with the Rajput, whose independence of mind\r\nplaces him above restraint, and whose hospitality and love of character\r\nwill always afford free communication to those who respect his opinions\r\nand his prejudices, and who are devoid of that overweening opinion of\r\nself, which imagines that nothing can be learned from such friendly\r\nintercourse. The personal dissimilarity accordingly arises from locale;\r\nthe mental similarity results from a grand fixed principle, which,\r\nwhatever its intrinsic moral effect, whatever its incompatibility with\r\nthe elevated notions we entertain, has preserved to these races, as\r\nnations, the enjoyment of their ancient habits to this distant period.\r\nMay our boasted superiority in all that exalts man above his fellows,\r\nensure to our Eastern empire like duration; and may these notions of our\r\nown peculiarly favoured destiny operate to prevent us from laying\r\nprostrate, in our periodical ambitious visitations, these the most\r\nancient relics of civilization on the face of the earth. For the dread\r\nof their amalgamation with our empire will prevail, though such a result\r\nwould be opposed not only to their happiness, but to our own stability.\r\n\r\n=Alliances with the British.=—With our present system of alliances, so\r\npregnant with evil from their origin, this fatal consequence (far from\r\ndesired by the legislative authorities at home) must inevitably ensue.\r\nIf the wit of man had been taxed to devise a series of treaties with a\r\nview to an ultimate rupture, these would be entitled to applause as\r\nspecimens of diplomacy.\r\n\r\nThere is a perpetual variation between the spirit and the letter of\r\nevery treaty; and while the internal independence of each State is the\r\ngroundwork, it is frittered away and nullified by successive\r\nstipulations, and these positive and negative qualities continue\r\nmutually repelling each other, until it is apparent that independence\r\ncannot exist under such conditions. Where discipline is lax, as with\r\nthese feudal associations, and where each subordinate vassal is master\r\nof his own retainers, the article of military contingents alone would\r\nprove a source of contention. By leading to interference with each\r\nindividual chieftain, it would render such aid worse than useless. But\r\nthis is a minor consideration to the tributary pecuniary stipulation\r\nwhich, unsettled and undetermined, leaves a door open to a [123] system\r\nof espionage into their revenue accounts—a system not only disgusting,\r\nbut contrary to treaty, which leaves ‘internal administration’ sacred.\r\nThese openings to dispute, and the general laxity of their governments\r\ncoming in contact with our regular system, present dangerous handles for\r\nambition: and who so blind as not to know that ambition to be\r\ndistinguished must influence every viceregent in the East? While deeds\r\nin arms and acquisition of territory outweigh the meek éclat of civil\r\nvirtue, the periodical visitations to these kingdoms will ever be like\r\nthe comet’s,\r\n\r\n                     Foreboding change to princes.\r\n\r\nOur position in the East has been, and continues to be, one in which\r\nconquest forces herself upon us. We have yet the power, however late, to\r\nhalt, and not anticipate her further orders to march. A contest for a\r\nmud-bank has carried our arms to the Aurea Chersonesus, the limit of\r\nPtolemy’s geography. With the Indus on the left, the Brahmaputra to the\r\nright, the Himalayan barrier towering like a giant to guard the Tatarian\r\nascent, the ocean and our ships at our back, such is our colossal\r\nattitude! But if misdirected ambition halts not at the Brahmaputra, but\r\nplunges in to gather laurels from the teak forest of Arakan, what surety\r\nhave we for these Hindu States placed by treaty within the grasp of our\r\ncontrol?\r\n\r\nBut the hope is cherished, that the same generosity which formed those\r\nties that snatched the Rajputs from degradation and impending\r\ndestruction, will maintain the pledge given in the fever of success,\r\n“that their independence should be sacred”; that it will palliate faults\r\nwe may not overlook, and perpetuate this oasis of ancient rule, in the\r\ndesert of destructive revolution, of races whose virtues are their own,\r\nand whose vices are the grafts of tyranny, conquest, and religious\r\nintolerance.[2.8.1]\r\n\r\nTo make them known is one step to obtain for them, at least, the boon of\r\nsympathy; for with the ephemeral power of our governors and the agents\r\nof government, is it to be expected that the rod will more softly fall\r\nwhen ignorance of their history prevails, and no kind association\r\nsprings from a knowledge of their martial achievements and yet proud\r\nbearing, their generosity, courtesy, and extended hospitality? These are\r\nRajput virtues yet extant amidst all their revolutions, and which have\r\nsurvived ages of Muhammadan bigotry and power; though to the honour of\r\nthe virtuous and magnanimous few among the crowned heads of eight\r\ncenturies, both Tatar and Mogul, there were some great souls [124]; men\r\nof high worth, who appeared at intervals to redeem the oppression of a\r\nwhole preceding dynasty.\r\n\r\nThe high ground we assumed, and the lofty sentiments with which we\r\nintroduced ourselves amongst the Rajputs, arrogating motives of purity,\r\nof disinterested benevolence, scarcely belonging to humanity, and to\r\nwhich their sacred writings alone yielded a parallel, gave such exalted\r\nnotions of our right of exerting the attributes of divinity, justice,\r\nand mercy, that they expected little less than almighty wisdom in our\r\nacts; but circumstances have throughout occurred in each individual\r\nState, to show we were mere mortals, and that the poet’s moral:\r\n\r\n              ’Tis distance lends enchantment to the view,\r\n\r\nwas true in politics. Sorrow and distrust were the consequences—anger\r\nsucceeded; but the sense of obligation is still too powerful to operate\r\na stronger and less generous sentiment. These errors may yet be\r\nredeemed, and our Rajput allies yet be retained as useful friends:\r\nthough they can only be so while in the enjoyment of perfect internal\r\nindependence, and their ancient institutions.\r\n\r\n“No political institution can endure,” observes the eloquent historian\r\nof the Middle Ages, “which does not rivet itself to the heart of men by\r\nancient prejudices or acknowledged merit. The feudal compact had much of\r\nthis character. In fulfilling the obligations of mutual assistance and\r\nfidelity by military service, the energies of friendship were awakened,\r\nand the ties of moral sympathy superadded to those of positive compact.”\r\n\r\nWe shall throw out one of the assumed causes which give stability to\r\npolitical institutions; ‘acknowledged merit,’ which never belonged to\r\nthe loose feudal compact of Rajwara; but the absence of this strengthens\r\nthe necessary substitute, ‘ancient prejudices,’ which supply many\r\ndefects.\r\n\r\nOur anomalous and inconsistent interference in some cases, and our\r\nnon-interference in others, operate alike to augment the dislocation\r\ninduced by long predatory oppression in the various orders of society,\r\ninstead of restoring that harmony and continuity which had previously\r\nexisted. The great danger, nay, the inevitable consequence of\r\nperseverance in this line of conduct, will be their reduction to the\r\nsame degradation with our other allies, and their ultimate incorporation\r\nwith our already too extended dominion [125].\r\n\r\nIt may be contended, that the scope and tenor of these alliances were\r\nnot altogether unfitted for the period when they were formed, and our\r\ncircumscribed knowledge; but was it too late, when this knowledge was\r\nextended, to purify them from the dross which deteriorated the two grand\r\nprinciples of mutual benefit, on which all were grounded, viz. ‘perfect\r\ninternal independence’ to them, and ‘acknowledged supremacy’ to the\r\nprotecting power? It will be said, that even these corner-stones of the\r\ngrand political fabric are far from possessing those durable qualities\r\nwhich the contracting parties define, but that, on the contrary, they\r\nare the Ormuzd and Ahrimanes, the good and evil principles of\r\ncontention. But when we have superadded pecuniary engagements of\r\nindefinite extent, increasing in the ratio of their prosperity, and\r\narmed quotas or contingents of their troops, whose loose habits and\r\ndiscipline would ensure constant complaint, we may certainly take credit\r\nfor having established a system which must compel that direct\r\ninterference, which the broad principle of each treaty professes to\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable consequence is the perpetuation of that denationalising\r\nprinciple, so well understood by the Mahrattas, ‘_divide et impera_.’ We\r\nare few; to use an Oriental metaphor, our agents must ‘use the eyes and\r\nears of others.’ That mutual dependence, which would again have arisen,\r\nour interference will completely nullify. Princes will find they can\r\noppress their chiefs, chiefs will find channels by which their\r\nsovereign’s commands may be rendered nugatory, and irresponsible\r\nministers must have our support to raise these undefined tributary\r\nsupplies; and unanimity, confidence, and all the sentiments of gratitude\r\nwhich they owe, and acknowledge to be our due, will gradually fade with\r\nthe national degradation. That our alliances have this tendency cannot\r\nbe disputed. By their very nature they transfer the respect of every\r\nclass of subjects from their immediate sovereign to the paramount\r\nauthority and its subordinate agents. Who will dare to urge that a\r\ngovernment, which cannot support its internal rule without restriction,\r\ncan be national? that without power unshackled and unrestrained by\r\nexterior council or espionage, it can maintain self-respect, the\r\ncorner-stone of every virtue with States as with individuals? This first\r\nof feelings these treaties utterly annihilate. Can we suppose such\r\ndenationalised allies are to be depended upon in emergencies? or, if\r\nallowed to retain a spark of their ancient moral inheritance, that it\r\n[126] will not be kindled into a flame against us when opportunity\r\noffers, instead of lighting up the powerful feeling of gratitude which\r\nyet exists towards us in these warlike communities?\r\n\r\nLike us they were the natural foes of that predatory system which so\r\nlong disturbed our power, and our preservation and theirs were alike\r\nconsulted in its destruction. When we sought their alliance, we spoke in\r\nthe captivating accents of philanthropy; we courted them to disunite\r\nfrom this Ahrimanes of political convulsion. The benevolent motives of\r\nthe great mover of these alliances we dare not call in question, and his\r\npolicy coincided with the soundest wisdom. But the treaties might have\r\nbeen revised, and the obnoxious parts which led to discord, abrogated,\r\nat the expense of a few paltry lacs of tribute and a portion of\r\nsovereign homage. It is not yet too late. True policy would enfranchise\r\nthem altogether from our alliance; but till then let them not feel their\r\nshackles in the galling restraint on each internal operation. Remove\r\nthat millstone to national prosperity, the poignant feeling that every\r\nincreased bushel of corn raised in their long-deserted fields must send\r\nits tithe to the British granaries. Let the national mind recover its\r\nwonted elasticity, and they will again attain their former celebrity. We\r\nhave the power to advance this greatness, and make it and its result our\r\nown; or, by a system unworthy of Britain, to retard and even quench it\r\naltogether.[2.8.2]\r\n\r\nNever were their national characteristics so much endangered as in the\r\nseducing calm which followed the tempestuous agitations in which they\r\nhad so long floated; doubtful, to use their own figurative expression,\r\nwhether ‘the gift of our friendship, or our arms,’ were fraught with\r\ngreater evil. The latter they could not withstand; though it must never\r\nbe lost sight of, that, like ancient Rome when her glory was fading, we\r\nuse ‘the arms of the barbarians’ to defend our conquests against them!\r\nIs the mind ever stationary? are virtue and high notions to be acquired\r\nfrom contact and example? Is there no mind above the level of £10\r\nmonthly pay in all the native legions of the three presidencies of\r\nIndia? no Odoacer, no Sivaji, [127] again to revive? Is the book of\r\nknowledge and of truth, which we hold up, only to teach them submission\r\nand perpetuate their weakness? Can we without fresh claims expect\r\neternal gratitude, and must we not rationally look for reaction in some\r\ngrand impulse, which, by furnishing a signal instance of the mutability\r\nof power, may afford a lesson for the benefit of posterity?\r\n\r\nIs the mantle of protection, which we have thrown over these warlike\r\nraces, likely to avert such a result? It might certainly, if imbued with\r\nall those philanthropic feelings for which we took credit, act with\r\nsoporific influence, and extinguish the embers of international\r\nanimosity. ‘The lion and the lamb were to drink from the same fountain’;\r\nthey were led to expect the holy Satya Yug, when each man reposed under\r\nhis own fig-tree, which neither strife nor envy dared approach.\r\n\r\nWhen so many nations are called upon, in a period of great calamity and\r\ndanger, to make over to a foreigner, their opposite in everything, their\r\nsuperior in most, the control of their forces in time of war, the\r\nadjudication of their disputes in time of peace, and a share in the\r\nfruits of their renovating prosperity, what must be the result; when\r\neach Rajput may hang up his lance in the hall, convert his sword to a\r\nploughshare, and make a basket of his buckler? What but the prostration\r\nof every virtue? It commences with the basis of the Rajput’s—the martial\r\nvirtues; extinguish these and they will soon cease to respect\r\nthemselves. Sloth, low cunning and meanness will follow. What nation\r\never maintained its character that devolved on the stranger the power of\r\nprotection! To be great, to be independent, its martial spirit must be\r\ncherished; happy if within the bounds of moderation. Led away by\r\nenthusiasm, the author experienced the danger of interference, when\r\nobserving but one side of the picture—the brilliant lights which shone\r\non their long days of darkness, not calculating the shade which would\r\nfollow the sudden glare.\r\n\r\nOn our cessation from every species of interference alone depends their\r\nindependence or their amalgamation—a crisis fraught with danger to our\r\novergrown rule.\r\n\r\nLet Alexander’s speech to his veterans, tired of conquest and refusing\r\nto cross the Hyphasis, be applied, and let us not reckon too strongly on\r\nour empire of opinion: “Fame never represents matters truly as they are,\r\nbut on the contrary magnifies everything. This is evident; for our own\r\nreputation and glory, though founded on solid truth, is yet more obliged\r\nto rumour than reality.”[2.8.3]\r\n\r\nWe may conclude with the Macedonian conqueror’s reasons for showing the\r\n[128] Persians and his other foreign allies so much favour: “The\r\npossession of what we got by the sword is not very durable, but the\r\nobligation of good offices is eternal. If we have a mind to keep Asia,\r\nand not simply pass through it, our clemency must extend to them also,\r\nand their fidelity will make our empire everlasting. As for ourselves,\r\nwe have more than we know what to do with, and it must be an insatiable,\r\navaricious temper which desires to continue to fill what already runs\r\nover.”[2.8.4] [129]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.8.1:\r\n\r\n  [The present relations of the States to the Government of India\r\n  justify these expectations.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.8.2:\r\n\r\n  If Lord Hastings’ philanthropy, which rejoiced in snatching these\r\n  ancient States from the degradation of predatory warfare, expected\r\n  that in four short years order should rise out of the chaos of a\r\n  century, and “was prepared to visit with displeasure all symptoms of\r\n  internal neglect, arising from supineness, indifference, or concealed\r\n  ill-will”; if _he_ signified that “government would take upon itself\r\n  the task of restoring order,” and that “all changes” on this score\r\n  “would be demanded and rigidly exacted”: in fine, that “such\r\n  arrangements would be made as would deprive them of the power of\r\n  longer abusing the spirit of liberal forbearance, the motives of which\r\n  they were incapable of understanding or appreciating”; what have they\r\n  to hope from those without his sympathies?\r\n\r\nFootnote 2.8.3:\r\n\r\n  Quintus Curtius, lib. ix.

[viii. 27].\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK III\r\n                 SKETCH OF A FEUDAL SYSTEM IN RĀJASTHĀN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 1\r\n\r\n\r\n=Feudalism in Rājasthān.=—It is more than doubtful whether any code of\r\ncivil or criminal jurisprudence ever existed in any of these\r\nprincipalities; though it is certain that none is at this day\r\ndiscoverable in their archives. But there is a martial system peculiar\r\nto these Rajput States, so extensive in its operation as to embrace\r\nevery object of society. This is so analogous to the ancient feudal\r\nsystem of Europe, that I have not hesitated to hazard a comparison\r\nbetween them, with reference to a period when the latter was yet\r\nimperfect. Long and attentive observation enables me to give this\r\noutline of a system, of which there exists little written evidence.\r\nCuriosity originally, and subsequently a sense of public duty (lest I\r\nmight be a party to injustice), co-operated in inducing me to make\r\nmyself fully acquainted with the minutiae of this traditionary theory of\r\ngovernment; and incidents, apparently trivial in themselves, exposed\r\nparts of a widely-extended system, which, though now disjointed, still\r\ncontinue to regulate the actions of extensive communities, and lead to\r\nthe inference, that at one period it must have attained a certain degree\r\nof perfection.\r\n\r\nMany years have elapsed since I first entertained these opinions, long\r\nbefore any connexion existed between these States and the British\r\nGovernment; when their geography was little known to us, and their\r\nhistory still less so. At that period I frequently travelled amongst\r\nthem for amusement, making these objects subservient thereto, and laying\r\nthe result freely before my Government. I had [130] abundant sources of\r\nintelligence to guide me in forming my analogies; Montesquieu, Hume,\r\nMillar, Gibbon[3.1.1]: but I sought only general resemblances and\r\nlineaments similar to those before me. A more perfect, because more\r\nfamiliar picture, has since appeared by an author,[3.1.2] who has drawn\r\naside the veil of mystery which covered the subject, owing to its being\r\ntill then but imperfectly understood. I compared the features of Rajput\r\nsociety with the finished picture of this eloquent writer, and shall be\r\nsatisfied with having substantiated the claim of these tribes to\r\nparticipation in a system, hitherto deemed to belong exclusively to\r\nEurope. I am aware of the danger of hypothesis, and shall advance\r\nnothing that I do not accompany by incontestable proofs.\r\n\r\n=The Tribal System.=—The leading features of government amongst\r\nsemi-barbarous hordes or civilized independent tribes must have a\r\nconsiderable resemblance to each other. In the same stages of society,\r\nthe wants of men must everywhere be similar, and will produce the\r\nanalogies which are observed to regulate Tatar hordes or German tribes,\r\nCaledonian clans, the Rajput Kula (race), or Jareja Bhayyad\r\n(brotherhood). All the countries of Europe participated in the system we\r\ndenominate feudal; and we can observe it, in various degrees of\r\nperfection or deterioration, from the mountains of Caucasus to the\r\nIndian Ocean. But it requires a persevering toil, and more\r\ndiscriminating judgement than I possess, to recover all these relics of\r\ncivilization: yet though time, and still more oppression, have veiled\r\nthe ancient institutions of Mewar, the mystery may be penetrated, and\r\nwill discover parts of a system worthy of being rescued from oblivion.\r\n\r\n=Influence of Muhammadans and Mahrattas.=—Mahratta cunning, engrafted on\r\nMuhammadan intolerance, had greatly obscured these institutions. The\r\nnation itself was passing rapidly away: the remnant which was left had\r\nbecome a matter of calculation, and their records and their laws partook\r\nof this general decay. The nation may recover; the physical frame may be\r\nrenewed; but the _morale_ of the society must be recast. In this chaos a\r\ncasual observer sees nothing to attract notice; the theory of government\r\nappears, without any of the dignity which now marks our regular system.\r\nWhatever does exist is attributed to fortuitous causes—to nothing\r\nsystematic: no fixed principle is discerned, and none is admitted; it is\r\ndeemed a mechanism without a plan. This opinion is hasty. Attention to\r\ndistinctions, though often merely nominal [131], will aid us in\r\ndiscovering the outlines of a picture which must at some period have\r\nbeen more finished; when real power, unrestrained by foreign influence,\r\nupheld a system, the plan of which was original. It is in these remote\r\nregions, so little known to the Western world, and where original\r\nmanners lie hidden under those of the conquerors, that we may search for\r\nthe germs of the constitutions of European States.[3.1.3] A contempt for\r\nall that is Asiatic too often marks our countrymen in the East: though\r\nat one period on record the taunt might have been reversed.\r\n\r\nIn remarking the curious coincidence between the habits, notions, and\r\ngovernments of Europe in the Middle Ages, and those of Rajasthan, it is\r\nnot absolutely necessary we should conclude that one system was borrowed\r\nfrom the other; each may, in truth, be said to have the patriarchal form\r\nfor its basis. I have sometimes been inclined to agree with the\r\ndefinition of Gibbon, who styles the system of our ancestors the\r\noffspring of chance and barbarism. “Le système féodal, assemblage\r\nmonstrueux de tant de parties que le tems et l’hazard ont réunies, nous\r\noffre un objet très compliqué: pour l’étudier il faut le\r\ndécomposer.”[3.1.4] This I shall attempt.\r\n\r\nThe form, as before remarked, is truly patriarchal in these States,\r\nwhere the greater portion of the vassal chiefs, from the highest of the\r\nsixteen peers to the holders of a _charsa_[3.1.5] of land, claim\r\naffinity in blood to the sovereign.[3.1.6]\r\n\r\nThe natural seeds are implanted in every soil, but the tree did not gain\r\n[132] maturity except in a favoured aspect. The perfection of the system\r\nin England is due to the Normans, who brought it from Scandinavia,\r\nwhither it was probably conveyed by Odin and the Sacasenae, or by\r\nanterior migrations, from Asia; which would coincide with Richardson’s\r\nhypothesis, who contends that it was introduced from Tatary. Although\r\nspeculative reasoning forms no part of my plan, yet when I observe\r\nanalogy on the subject in the customs of the ancient German tribes, the\r\nFranks or Gothic races, I shall venture to note them. Of one thing there\r\nis no doubt—knowledge must have accompanied the tide of migration from\r\nthe east: and from higher Asia emerged in the Asi, the Chatti, and the\r\nCimbric Lombard, who spread the system in Scandinavia, Friesland, and\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n=Origin of Feuds.=—“It has been very common,” says the enlightened\r\nhistorian of the Feudal System in the Middle Ages, “to seek for the\r\norigin of feuds, or at least for analogies to them, in the history of\r\nvarious countries; but though it is of great importance to trace the\r\nsimilarity of customs in different parts of the world, we should guard\r\nagainst seeming analogies, which vanish away when they are closely\r\nobserved. It is easy to find partial resemblances to the feudal system.\r\nThe relation of patron and client in the republic of Rome has been\r\ndeemed to resemble it, as well as the barbarians and veterans who held\r\nfrontier lands on the tenure of defending them and the frontier; but\r\nthey were bound not to an individual, but to the state. Such a\r\nresemblance of fiefs may be found in the Zamindars of Hindustan and the\r\nTimariots of Turkey. The clans of the Highlanders and Irish followed\r\ntheir chieftain into the field: but their tie was that of imagined\r\nkindred and birth, not the spontaneous compact of vassalage.”[3.1.7]\r\n\r\nI give this at length to show, that if I still persist in deeming the\r\nRajput system a pure relation of feuds, I have before my eyes the danger\r\nof seeming resemblances. But grants, deeds, charters, and traditions,\r\ncopies of all of which will be found in the Appendix, will establish my\r\nopinions. I hope to prove that the tribes in the northern regions of\r\nHindustan did possess the system, and that it was handed down, and still\r\nobtains, notwithstanding seven centuries of paramount sway of the Mogul\r\nand Pathan dynasties, altogether opposed to them except in this feature\r\nof government where there was an original similarity. In some of these\r\nStates—those least affected by conquest—the system remained freer from\r\ninnovation. It is, however, from Mewar chiefly that I shall deduce my\r\nexamples, as its internal [133] rule was less influenced by foreign\r\npolicy, even to the period at which the imperial power of Delhi was on\r\nthe decline.\r\n\r\n=Evidence from Mewar.=—As in Europe, for a length of time, traditionary\r\ncustom was the only regulator of the rights and tenures of this system,\r\nvarying in each State, and not unfrequently (in its minor details) in\r\nthe different provinces of one State, according to their mode of\r\nacquisition and the description of occupants when required. It is from\r\nsuch circumstances that the variety of tenure and customary law\r\nproceeds. To account for this variety, a knowledge of them is requisite;\r\nnor is it until every part of the system is developed that it can be\r\nfully understood. The most trifling cause is discovered to be the parent\r\nof some important result. If ever these were embodied into a code (and\r\nwe are justified in assuming such to have been the case), the varied\r\nrevolutions which have swept away almost all relics of their history\r\nwere not likely to spare these. Mention is made of several princes of\r\nthe house of Mewar who legislated for their country; but precedents for\r\nevery occurring case lie scattered in formulas, grants, and traditionary\r\nsayings. The inscriptions still existing on stone would alone, if\r\ncollected, form a body of laws sufficient for an infant community; and\r\nthese were always first committed to writing, and registered ere the\r\ncolumn was raised. The seven centuries of turmoil and disaster, during\r\nwhich these States were in continual strife with the foe, produced many\r\nprinces of high intellect as well as valour. Sanga Rana, and his\r\nantagonist, Sultan Babur, were revived in their no less celebrated\r\ngrandsons, the great Akbar and Rana Partap: the son of the latter, Amra,\r\nthe foe of Jahangir, was a character of whom the proudest nation might\r\nbe vain.\r\n\r\n=Evidence from Inscriptions.=—The pen has recorded, and tradition handed\r\ndown, many isolated fragments of the genius of these Rajput princes, as\r\nstatesmen and warriors, touching the political division, regulations of\r\nthe aristocracy, and commercial and agricultural bodies. Sumptuary laws,\r\neven, which append to a feudal system, are to be traced in these\r\ninscriptions; the annulling of monopolies and exorbitant taxes; the\r\nregulation of transit duties; prohibition of profaning sacred days by\r\nlabour; immunities, privileges, and charters to trades, corporations,\r\nand towns; such as would, in climes more favourable to liberty, have\r\nmatured into a league, or obtained for these branches a voice in the\r\ncouncils of the State. My search for less perishable documents than\r\nparchment when I found the cabinet of the prince contained them not, was\r\nunceasing; but though the bigoted Muhammadan destroyed [134] most of the\r\ntraces of civilization within his reach, perseverance was rewarded with\r\na considerable number. They are at least matter of curiosity. They will\r\nevince that monopolies and restraints on commerce were well understood\r\nin Rajwara, though the doctrines of political economy never gained\r\nfooting there. The setting up of these engraved tablets or pillars,\r\ncalled Seoras,[3.1.8] is of the highest antiquity. Every subject\r\ncommences with invoking the sun and moon as witnesses, and concludes\r\nwith a denunciation of the severest penalties on those who break the\r\nspirit of the imperishable bond. Tablets of an historical nature I have\r\nof twelve and fourteen hundred years’ antiquity, but of grants of land\r\nor privileges about one thousand years is the oldest. Time has destroyed\r\nmany, but man more. They became more numerous during the last three\r\ncenturies, when successful struggles against their foes produced new\r\nprivileges, granted in order to recall the scattered inhabitants. Thus\r\none contains an abolition of the monopoly of tobacco;[3.1.9] another,\r\nthe remission of tax on printed cloths, with permission to the country\r\nmanufacturers to sell their goods free of duty at the neighbouring\r\ntowns. To a third, a mercantile city, the abolition of war\r\ncontributions,[3.1.10] and the establishment of its internal judicial\r\nauthority. Nay, even where good manners alone are concerned, the\r\nlawgiver appears, and with an amusing simplicity:[3.1.11] “From the\r\npublic feast none shall attempt to carry anything away.” “None shall eat\r\nafter sunset,” shows that a Jain obtained the edict. To yoke the bullock\r\nor other animal for any work on the sacred Amavas,[3.1.12] is also\r\ndeclared punishable. Others contain revocations of vexatious fees to\r\nofficers of the crown; “of beds and quilts[3.1.13]”; “the seizure of the\r\ncarts, implements, or cattle of the husbandmen,”[3.1.14]—the sole boon\r\nin our own Magna Charta demanded for the husbandman. These and several\r\nothers, of which copies are annexed, need not be repeated. If even from\r\nsuch memoranda a sufficient number could be collected of each prince’s\r\nreign up to the olden time, what more could we desire to enable us to\r\njudge of the genius of their princes, the wants and habits of the\r\npeople, their acts and occupations? The most ancient written customary\r\nlaw of France is A.D. 1088,[3.1.15] at which time Mewar was in high\r\n[135] prosperity; opposing, at the head of a league far more powerful\r\nthan France could form for ages after, the progress of revolution and\r\nforeign conquest. Ignorance, sloth, and all the vices which wait on and\r\nresult from continual oppression in a perpetual struggle for existence\r\nof ages’ duration, gradually diminished the reverence of the inhabitants\r\nthemselves for these relics of the wisdom of their forefathers. In\r\nlatter years, they so far forgot the ennobling feeling and respect for\r\n‘the stone which told’ their once exalted condition, as to convert the\r\nmaterials of the temple in which many of these stood into places of\r\nabode. Thus many a valuable relic is built up in the castles of their\r\nbarons, or buried in the rubbish of the fallen pile.\r\n\r\n=Books of Grants.=—We have, however, the books of grants to the chiefs\r\nand vassals, and also the grand rent-roll of the country. These are of\r\nthemselves valuable documents. Could we but obtain those of remoter\r\nperiods, they would serve as a commentary on the history of the country,\r\nas each contains the detail of every estate, and the stipulated service,\r\nin horse and foot, to be performed for it. In later times, when\r\nturbulence and disaffection went unpunished, it was useless to specify a\r\nstipulation of service that was nugatory; and too often the grants\r\ncontained but the names of towns and villages, and their value; or if\r\nthey had the more general terms of service, none of its details.[3.1.16]\r\nFrom all these, however, a sufficiency of customary rules could easily\r\nbe found to form the written law of fiefs in Rajasthan. In France, in\r\nthe sixteenth century, the variety of these customs amounted to two\r\nhundred and eighty-five, of which only sixty[3.1.17] were of great\r\nimportance. The number of consequence in Mewar which have come to my\r\nobservation is considerable, and the most important will be given in the\r\nAppendix. Were the same plan pursued there as in that ordinance which\r\nproduced the laws of Pays Coutumiers[3.1.18] of France, viz.\r\nascertaining those of each district, the materials are ready.\r\n\r\nSuch a collection would be amusing, particularly if the traditionary\r\nwere added to the engraved laws. They would often appear jejune, and\r\nmight involve contradictions; but we should see the wants of the people;\r\nand if ever our connexion (which God forbid!) should be drawn closer, we\r\ncould then legislate without offending national customs or religious\r\nprejudices. Could this, by any instinctive [136] impulse or external\r\nstimulus, be effected by themselves, it would be the era of their\r\nemersion from long oppression, and might lead to better notions of\r\ngovernment, and consequent happiness to them all.\r\n\r\n=Noble Origin of the Rājput Race.=—If we compare the antiquity and\r\nillustrious descent of the dynasties which have ruled, and some which\r\ncontinue to rule, the small sovereignties of Rajasthan, with many of\r\ncelebrity in Europe, superiority will often attach to the Rajput. From\r\nthe most remote periods we can trace nothing ignoble, nor any vestige of\r\nvassal origin. Reduced in power, circumscribed in territory, compelled\r\nto yield much of their splendour and many of the dignities of birth,\r\nthey have not abandoned an iota of the pride and high bearing arising\r\nfrom a knowledge of their illustrious and regal descent. On this\r\nprinciple the various revolutions in the Rana’s family never encroached;\r\nand the mighty Jahangir himself, the Emperor of the Moguls, became, like\r\nCaesar, the commentator on the history of the tribe of Sesodia.[3.1.19]\r\nThe potentate of the twenty-two Satrapies of Hind dwells with proud\r\ncomplacency on this Rajput king having made terms with him. He praises\r\nheaven, that what his immortal ancestor Babur, the founder of the Mogul\r\ndynasty, failed to do, the project in which Humayun had also failed, and\r\nin which the illustrious Akbar, his father, had but partial success, was\r\nreserved for him. It is pleasing to peruse in the commentaries of these\r\nconquerors, Babur and Jahangir, their sentiments with regard to these\r\nprinces. We have the evidence of Sir Thomas Roe, the ambassador of\r\nElizabeth to Jahangir, as to the splendour of this race: it appears\r\nthroughout their annals and those of their neighbours.\r\n\r\n=The Rāthors of Mārwār.=—The Rathors can boast a splendid pedigree; and\r\nif we cannot trace its source with equal certainty to such a period of\r\nantiquity as the Rana’s, we can, at all events, show the Rathor monarch\r\nwielding the sceptre at Kanauj, at the time the leader of an unknown\r\ntribe of the Franks was paving the way towards the foundation of the\r\nfuture kingdom of France. Unwieldy greatness caused the sudden fall of\r\nKanauj in the twelfth century, of which the existing line of Marwar is a\r\nrenovated scion.[3.1.20]\r\n\r\n=The Kachhwāhas of Amber.=—Amber is a branch of the once illustrious and\r\nancient [137] Nishadha, now Narwar, which produced the ill-fated prince\r\nwhose story[3.1.21] is so interesting. Revolution and conquest compelled\r\nthem to quit their ancestral abodes. Hindustan was then divided into no\r\nmore than four great kingdoms. By Arabian[3.1.22] travellers we have a\r\nconfused picture of these States. But all the minor States, now existing\r\nin the west, arose about the period when the feudal system was\r\napproaching maturity in France and England.\r\n\r\nThe others are less illustrious, being the descendants of the great\r\nvassals of their ancient kings.\r\n\r\n=The Sesodias of Mewār.=—Mewar exhibits a marked difference from all the\r\nother States in her policy and institutions. She was an old-established\r\ndynasty when these renovated scions were in embryo. We can trace the\r\nlosses of Mewar, but with difficulty her acquisitions; while it is easy\r\nto note the gradual aggrandisement of Marwar and Amber, and all the\r\nminor States. Marwar was composed of many petty States, whose ancient\r\npossessions formed an allodial vassalage under the new dynasty. A\r\nsuperior independence of the control of the prince arises from the\r\npeculiarity of the mode of acquisition; that is, with rights similar to\r\nthe allodial vassals of the European feudal system.\r\n\r\n=Pride of Ancestry.=—The poorest Rajput of this day retains all the\r\npride of ancestry, often his sole inheritance; he scorns to hold the\r\nplough, or to use his lance but on horseback. In these aristocratic\r\nideas he is supported by his reception amongst his superiors, and the\r\nrespect paid to him by his inferiors. The honours and privileges, and\r\nthe gradations of rank, amongst the vassals of the Rana’s house, exhibit\r\na highly artificial and refined state of society. Each of the superior\r\nrank is entitled to a banner, kettle-drums preceded by heralds and\r\nsilver maces, with peculiar gifts and personal honours, in commemoration\r\nof some exploit of their ancestors.\r\n\r\n=Armorial Bearings.=—The martial Rajputs are not strangers to armorial\r\nbearings,[3.1.23] now so indiscriminately used in Europe. The great\r\nbanner of Mewar exhibits a golden sun [138] on a crimson field; those of\r\nthe chiefs bear a dagger. Amber displays the _panchranga_, or\r\nfive-coloured flag. The lion rampant on an argent field is extinct with\r\nthe State of Chanderi.[3.1.24]\r\n\r\nIn Europe these customs were not introduced till the period of the\r\nCrusades, and were copied from the Saracens; while the use of them\r\namongst the Rajput tribes can be traced to a period anterior to the war\r\nof Troy. In the Mahabharat, or great war, twelve hundred years before\r\nChrist, we find the hero Bhishma exulting over his trophy, the banner of\r\nArjuna, its field adorned with the figure of the Indian Hanuman.[3.1.25]\r\nThese emblems had a religious reference amongst the Hindus, and were\r\ntaken from their mythology, the origin of all devices.\r\n\r\n=The Tribal Palladium.=—Every royal house has its palladium, which is\r\nfrequently borne to battle at the saddle-bow of the prince. Rao Bhima\r\nHara, of Kotah, lost his life and protecting deity together. The late\r\ncelebrated Khichi[3.1.26] leader, Jai Singh, never took the field\r\nwithout the god before him. ‘Victory to Bajrang’ was his signal for the\r\ncharge so dreaded by the Mahratta, and often has the deity been\r\nsprinkled with his blood and that of the foe. Their ancestors, who\r\nopposed Alexander, did the same, and carried the image of Hercules\r\n(_Baldeva_) at the head of their array.[3.1.27]\r\n\r\n=Banners.=—The custom (says Arrian) of presenting banners as an emblem\r\nof sovereignty over vassals, also obtained amongst the tribes of the\r\nIndus when invaded by Alexander. When he conquered the Saka and tribes\r\neast of the Caspian, he divided the provinces amongst the princes of the\r\nancient families, for which they paid homage, engaged to serve with a\r\ncertain quota of troops, and received from his own hand a banner; in all\r\nof which he followed the customs of the country. But in these we see\r\nonly the outline of the system; we must descend to more modern days to\r\nobserve it more minutely. A grand picture is drawn of the power of\r\nMewar, when the first grand irruption of the Muhammadans occurred in the\r\nfirst century of their era; when “a hundred[3.1.28] kings, its allies\r\nand dependents, had their thrones raised in Chitor,” for its defence and\r\ntheir own individually [139], when a new religion, propagated by the\r\nsword of conquest, came to enslave these realms. This invasion was by\r\nSind and Makran; for it was half a century later ere ‘the light’ shone\r\nfrom the heights of Pamir[3.1.29] on the plains of the Jumna and Ganges.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of this religious war in the mountains westward of\r\nthe Indus, many ages elapsed ere the ‘King of the Faith’ obtained a seat\r\non the throne of Yudhishthira. Chand, the bard, has left us various\r\nvaluable memorials of this period, applicable to the subject\r\nhistorically as well as to the immediate topic. Visaladeva, the monarch\r\nwhose name appears on the pillar of victory at Delhi, led an army\r\nagainst the invader, in which, according to the bard, “the banners of\r\neighty-four princes were assembled.” The bard describes with great\r\nanimation the summons sent for this magnificent feudal levy from the\r\nheart of Antarbedi,[3.1.30] to the shores of the western sea, and it\r\ncoincides with the record of his victory, which most probably this very\r\narmy obtained for him. But no finer picture of feudal manners exists\r\nthan the history of Prithwiraja, contained in Chand’s poems. It is\r\nsurprising that this epic should have been allowed so long to sleep\r\nneglected: a thorough knowledge of it, and of others of the same\r\ncharacter, would open many sources of new knowledge, and enable us to\r\ntrace many curious and interesting coincidences.[3.1.31]\r\n\r\nIn perusing these tales of the days that are past, we should be induced\r\nto conclude that the Kuriltai of the Tatars, the Chaugan of the Rajput,\r\nand the Champ de Mars of the Frank, had one common origin.\r\n\r\n=Influence of Caste.=—Caste has for ever prevented the inferior classes\r\nof society from being incorporated with this haughty _noblesse_. Only\r\nthose of pure blood in both lines can hold fiefs of the crown. The\r\nhighest may marry the daughter of a Rajput, whose sole [140] possession\r\nis a ‘skin of land’:[3.1.32] the sovereign himself is not degraded by\r\nsuch alliance. There is no moral blot, and the operation of a law like\r\nthe Salic would prevent any political evil resulting therefrom. Titles\r\nare granted, and even fiefs of office, to ministers and civil servants\r\nnot Rajputs; they are, however, but official, and never confer\r\nhereditary right. These official fiefs may have originally arisen, here\r\nand in Europe, from the same cause; the want of a circulating medium to\r\npay the offices. The Mantris[3.1.33] of Mewar prefer estates to\r\npecuniary stipend, which gives more consequence in every point of view.\r\nAll the higher offices—as cup-bearer, butler, stewards of the household,\r\nwardrobe, kitchen, master of the horse—all these are enumerated as\r\nministerialists[3.1.34] at the court of Charlemagne in the dark ages of\r\nEurope, and of whom we have the duplicates. These are what the author of\r\nthe Middle Ages designates as “improper feuds.”[3.1.35] In Mewar the\r\nprince’s architect, painter, physician, bard, genealogist, heralds, and\r\nall the generation of the foster-brothers, hold lands. Offices are\r\nhereditary in this patriarchal government; their services personal. The\r\ntitle even appends to the family, and if the chance of events deprive\r\nthem of the substance, they are seldom left destitute. It is not\r\nuncommon to see three or four with the title of pardhan or\r\npremier.[3.1.36]\r\n\r\nBut before I proceed further in these desultory and general remarks, I\r\nshall commence the chief details of the system as described in times\r\npast, and, in part, still obtaining in the principality of the Rana of\r\nMewar. As its geography and distribution are fully related in their\r\nproper place, I must refer the reader to that for a preliminary\r\nunderstanding of its localities.\r\n\r\n=Estates of Chief and Fiscal Land.=—The local disposition of the estates\r\nwas admirably contrived. Bounded on three sides, the south, east, and\r\nwest, by marauding barbarous tribes of Bhils, Mers, and Minas, the\r\ncircumference of this circle was subdivided into estates for the chiefs,\r\nwhile the _khalisa_, or fiscal land, the best and richest, was in the\r\nheart of the country, and consequently well protected [141]. It appears\r\ndoubtful whether the khalisa lands amounted to one-fourth of those\r\ndistributed in grant to the chiefs. The value of the crown demesne as\r\nthe nerve and sinew of sovereignty, was well known by the former heads\r\nof this house. To obtain any portion thereof was the reward of important\r\nservices; to have a grant of a few acres near the capital for a garden\r\nwas deemed a high favour; and a village in the amphitheatre or valley,\r\nin which the present capital is situated, was the _ne plus ultra_ of\r\nrecompense. But the lavish folly of the present prince, out of this\r\ntract, twenty-five miles in circumference, has not preserved a single\r\nvillage in his khalisa. By this distribution, and by the inroads of the\r\nwild tribes in the vicinity, or of Moguls and Mahrattas, the valour of\r\nthe chiefs were kept in constant play.\r\n\r\nThe country was partitioned into districts, each containing from fifty\r\nto one hundred towns and villages, though sometimes exceeding that\r\nproportion. The great number of Chaurasis[3.1.37] leads to the\r\nconclusion that portions to the amount of eighty-four had been the\r\ngeneral subdivision. Many of these yet remain: as the ‘Chaurasi’ of\r\nJahazpur and of Kumbhalmer: tantamount to the old ‘hundreds’ of our\r\nSaxon ancestry. A circle of posts was distributed, within which the\r\nquotas of the chiefs attended, under ‘the Faujdar of the Sima’ (_vulgo_\r\nSim), or commander of the border. It was found expedient to appoint from\r\ncourt this lord of the frontier, always accompanied by a portion of the\r\nroyal insignia, standard, kettle-drums, and heralds, and being generally\r\na civil officer, he united to his military office the administration of\r\njustice.[3.1.38] The higher vassals never attended personally at these\r\nposts, but deputed a confidential branch of their family, with the quota\r\nrequired. For the government of the districts there were conjoined a\r\ncivil and a military officer: the latter generally a vassal of the\r\nsecond rank. Their residence was the chief place of the district,\r\ncommonly a stronghold.\r\n\r\nThe division of the chiefs into distinct grades, shows a highly\r\nartificial state of society.\r\n\r\nFirst class.—We have the Sixteen, whose estates were from fifty thousand\r\nto one hundred thousand rupees and upwards, of yearly rent. These appear\r\nin the [142] presence only on special invitation, upon festivals and\r\nsolemn ceremonies, and are the hereditary councillors of the\r\ncrown.[3.1.39]\r\n\r\nSecond class, from five to fifty thousand rupees. Their duty is to be\r\nalways in attendance. From these, chiefly, faujdars and military\r\nofficers are selected.[3.1.39]\r\n\r\nThird class is that of Gol[3.1.39] holding lands chiefly under five\r\nthousand rupees, though by favour they may exceed this limit. They are\r\ngenerally the holders of separate villages and portions of land, and in\r\nformer times they were the most useful class to the prince. They always\r\nattended on his person, and indeed formed his strength against any\r\ncombination or opposition of the higher vassals.\r\n\r\nFourth class.—The offsets of the younger branches of the Rana’s own\r\nfamily, within a certain period, are called the _babas_, literally\r\n‘infants,’ and have appanages bestowed on them. Of this class are\r\nShahpura and Banera; too powerful for subjects.[3.1.40] They hold on\r\nnone of the terms of the great clans, but consider themselves at the\r\ndisposal of the prince. These are more within the influence of the\r\ncrown. Allowing adoption into these houses, except in the case of near\r\nkindred, is assuredly an innovation; they ought to revert to the crown,\r\nfailing immediate issue, as did the great estate of Bhainsrorgarh, two\r\ngenerations back. From these to the holder of a _charsa_, or hide of\r\nland, the peculiarity of tenure and duties of each will form a subject\r\nfor discussion.\r\n\r\n=Revenues and Rights of the Crown.=—I need not here expatiate upon the\r\nvariety of items which constitute the revenues of the prince, the\r\ndetails of which will appear in their proper place. The land-tax in the\r\nkhalisa demesne is, of course, the chief source of supply; the transit\r\nduties on commerce and trade, and those of the larger towns and\r\ncommercial marts, rank next. In former times more attention was paid to\r\nthis important branch of income, and the produce was greater because\r\nless shackled. The liberality on the side of the crown was only equalled\r\nby the integrity of the merchant, and the extent to which it was carried\r\nwould imply an almost Utopian degree of perfection in their mutual\r\nqualities of liberality and honesty; the one, perhaps, generating the\r\nother. The remark of a merchant recently, on the vexatious train of\r\nduties and espionage attending their collection, is not merely\r\nfigurative: \"our ancestors tied their invoice to the horns of the\r\noxen[3.1.42] at the first frontier post of customs, and no intermediate\r\nquestions [143] were put till we passed to the opposite or sold our\r\ngoods, when it was opened and payment made accordingly; but now every\r\ntown has its rights.\" It will be long ere this degree of confidence is\r\nrestored on either side; extensive demand on the one is met by fraud and\r\nevasion on the other, though at least one-half of these evils have\r\nalready been subdued.\r\n\r\n=Mines and Minerals.=—The mines were very productive in former times,\r\nand yielded several lacs to the princes of Mewar.[3.1.43] The rich tin\r\nmines of Jawara produced at one time a considerable proportion of\r\nsilver. Those of copper are abundant, as is also iron on the now\r\nalienated domain on the Chambal; but lead least of all.[3.1.44]\r\n\r\nThe marble quarries also added to the revenue; and where there is such a\r\nmultiplicity of sources, none are considered too minute to be applied in\r\nthese necessitous times.\r\n\r\n=Barār.=—_Barar_ is an indefinite term for taxation, and is connected\r\nwith the thing taxed: as _ghanim-barar_,[3.1.45] ‘war-tax’; _ghar\r\nginti-barar_,[3.1.46] ‘house-tax’; _hal-barar_, ‘plough-tax’;\r\n_neota-barar_, ‘marriage-tax’; and others, both of old and new standing.\r\nThe war-tax was a kind of substitute for the regular mode of levying the\r\nrents on the produce of the soil; which was rendered very difficult\r\nduring the disturbed period, and did not accord with the wants of the\r\nprince. It is also a substitute in those mountainous regions, for the\r\n_jarib_,[3.1.47] where the produce bears no proportion to the cultivated\r\nsurface; sometimes from poverty of soil, but often from the reverse, as\r\nin Kumbhalmer, where the choicest crops are produced on the cultivated\r\nterraces, and on the sides of its mountains, which abound with springs,\r\nyielding the richest canes and cottons, and where experiment has proved\r\nthat four crops can be raised in the same patch of soil within the year.\r\n\r\nThe offering on confirmation of estates (or fine on renewal) is now,\r\nthough a very small, yet still one source of supply; as is the annual\r\nand triennial payment of the quit-rents of the Bhumia chiefs. Fines in\r\ncomposition of offences may also be mentioned: and they might be larger,\r\nif more activity were introduced in the detection of offenders [144].\r\n\r\nThese governments are mild in the execution of the laws; and a heavy\r\nfine has more effect (especially on the hill tribes) than the execution\r\nof the offender, who fears death less than the loss of property.\r\n\r\n=Khar-Lakar.=—The composition for ‘wood and forage’ afforded a\r\nconsiderable supply. When the princes of Mewar were oftener in the\r\ntented field than in the palace, combating for their preservation, it\r\nwas the duty of every individual to store up wood and forage for the\r\nsupply of the prince’s army. What originated in necessity was converted\r\ninto an abuse and annual demand. The towns also supplied a certain\r\nportion of provisions; where the prince halted for the day these were\r\nlevied on the community; a goat or sheep from the shepherd, milk and\r\nflour from the farmer. The maintenance of these customs is observable in\r\ntaxes, for the origin of which it is impossible to assign a reason\r\nwithout going into the history of the period; they scarcely recollect\r\nthe source of some of these themselves. They are akin to those known\r\nunder the feudal tenures of France, arising from exactly the same\r\ncauses, and commuted for money payments; such as the _droit de giste et\r\nde chevauche_.[3.1.48] Many also originated in the perambulations of\r\nthese princes to visit their domains;[3.1.49] a black year in the\r\ncalendar to the chief and the subject. When he honoured the chief by a\r\nvisit, he had to present horses and arms, and to entertain his prince,\r\nin all which honours the cultivators and merchants had to share. The\r\nduties on the sale of spirits, opium, tobacco, and even to a share of\r\nthe garden-stuff, affords also modes of supply [145].[3.1.50]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.1.1:\r\n\r\n  _Miscellaneous Works_, vol. iii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.1.2:\r\n\r\n  Hallam’s _Middle Ages_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.1.3:\r\n\r\n  It is a high gratification to be supported by such authority as M. St.\r\n  Martin, who, in his _Discours sur l’Origine et l’Histoire des\r\n  Arsacides_, thus speaks of the system of government termed feudal,\r\n  which I contend exists amongst the Rajputs: \"On pense assez\r\n  généralement que cette sorte de gouvernement qui dominait il y a\r\n  quelques siècles, et qu’on appelle _système féodal_, était\r\n  particulière à l’Europe, et que c’est dans les forêts de la Germanie\r\n  qu’il faut en chercher l’origine. Cependant, si au lieu d’admettre les\r\n  faits sans les discuter, comme il arrive trop souvent, on examinait un\r\n  peu cette opinion, elle disparaitrait devant la critique, ou du moins\r\n  elle se modifierait singulièrement; et l’on verrait que, si c’est des\r\n  forêts de la Germanie que nous avons tiré le gouvernement féodal, il\r\n  n’en est certainement pas originaire. Si l’on veut comparer l’Europe,\r\n  telle qu’elle était au xii^e siècle, avec la monarchie fondée en Asie\r\n  par les Arsacides trois siècles avant notre ère, partout on verra des\r\n  institutions et des usages pareils. On y trouvera les mêmes dignités,\r\n  et jusqu’aux mêmes titres, etc., etc. Boire, chasser, combattre, faire\r\n  et défaire des rois, c’étaient là les nobles occupations d’un Parthe\"\r\n  (_Journal Asiatique_, vol. i. p. 65).

In these the martial vassals or chiefs had no\r\nconcern: a wise exclusion, comprehending also their immediate\r\ndependents, military, commercial, and agricultural. Even now, the little\r\nthat is done in these matters is effected by the civil administration,\r\nthough the Rajput Pardhans have been too apt to interfere in matters\r\nfrom which they ought always to be kept aloof, being ever more tenacious\r\nof their own rights than solicitous for the welfare of the community.\r\n\r\n=Panchāyats.=—The neglect in the legislation of late years was supplied\r\nby the self-constituted tribunals, the useful panchayats, of which\r\nenough has been said to render further illustration unnecessary. Besides\r\nthe resident ruler of the district, who was also a judicial functionary,\r\nthere was, as already stated, a special officer of the government in\r\neach frontier thana, or garrison post. He united the triple occupation\r\nof embodying the quotas, levying the transit duties, and administering\r\njustice, in which he was aided at the chabutra[3.2.1] or court, by\r\nassembling the Chauthias or assessors of justice. Each town and village\r\nhas its chauthia, the members of which are elected by their\r\nfellow-citizens, and remain as long as they conduct themselves\r\nimpartially in disentangling the intricacies of complaints preferred to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey are the aids to the Nagarseth, or chief magistrate, an hereditary\r\noffice in every large city in Rajasthan. Of this chauthia the Patel and\r\nPatwari[3.2.2] are generally members. The former of these, like the\r\nDasaundhi of the Mahrattas, resembles in his duties the decanus of\r\nFrance and the tithing-man in England. The chauthia and panchayat of\r\nthese districts are analogous to the assessors of [146] justice called\r\n_scabini_[3.2.3] in France, who held the office by election or the\r\nconcurrence of the people. But these are the special and fixed council\r\nof each town; the general panchayats are formed from the respectable\r\npopulation at large, and were formerly from all classes of society.\r\n\r\nThe chabutras, or terraces of justice, were always established in the\r\nkhalisa, or crown demesne. It was deemed a humiliating intrusion if they\r\nsat within the bounds of a chief. To ‘erect the flag’ within his limits,\r\nwhether for the formation of defensive posts or the collection of\r\nduties, is deemed a gross breach of his privileged independence, as to\r\nestablish them within the walls of his residence would be deemed equal\r\nto sequestration. It often becomes necessary to see justice enforced on\r\na chief or his dependent, but it begets eternal disputes and\r\ndisobedience, till at length they are worried to compliance by rozina.\r\n\r\n=Rozīna.=—When delay in these matters, or to the general commands of the\r\nprince, is evinced, an officer or herald is deputed with a party of\r\nfour, ten, or twenty horse or foot, to the fief of the chief, at whose\r\nresidence they take up their abode; and carrying, under the seal, a\r\nwarrant to furnish them with specified daily (_rozina_) rations, they\r\nlive at free quarters till he is quickened into compliance with the\r\ncommands of the prince. This is the only accelerator of the slow\r\nmovements of a Rajput chieftain in these days, whether for his\r\nappearance at court or the performance of an act of justice. It is often\r\ncarried to a harassing excess, and causes much complaint.\r\n\r\nIn cases regarding the distribution of justice or the internal economy\r\nof the chief’s estates, the government officers seldom interfere. But of\r\ntheir panchayats I will only remark, that their import amongst the\r\nvassals is very comprehensive; and when they talk of the ‘_panch_,’ it\r\nmeans the ‘collective wisdom.’ In the reply to the remonstrance of the\r\nDeogarh vassals,[3.2.4] the chief promises never to undertake any\r\nmeasure without their deliberation and sanction.\r\n\r\nOn all grand occasions where the general peace or tranquillity of the\r\ngovernment is threatened, the chiefs form the council of the sovereign.\r\nSuch subjects are always first discussed in the domestic councils of\r\neach chief; so that when the [147] _witenagemot_ of Mewar was assembled,\r\neach had prepared himself by previous discussion, and was fortified by\r\nabundance of advice.\r\n\r\nTo be excluded the council of the prince is to be in utter disgrace.\r\nThese grand divans produce infinite speculation, and the ramifications\r\nwhich form the opinions are extensive. The council of each chief is, in\r\nfact, a miniature representation of the sovereign’s. The greater\r\nsub-vassals, his civil pardhan, the mayor of the household, the\r\npurohit,[3.2.5] the bard, and two or three of the most intelligent\r\ncitizens, form the minor councils, and all are separately deliberating\r\nwhile the superior court is in discussion. Thus is collected the wisdom\r\nof the magnates of Rajwara.\r\n\r\n=Military Service.=—In Mewar, during the days of her glory and\r\nprosperity, fifteen thousand horse, bound by the ties of fidelity and\r\nservice, followed their prince into the field, all supported by lands\r\nheld by grant; from the chief who headed five hundred of his own\r\nvassals, to the single horseman.\r\n\r\n=Knight’s Fee or Single Horsemen.=—A knight’s fee in these States\r\nvaries. For each thousand rupees of annual rent, never less than two,\r\nand generally three horsemen were furnished; and sometimes three horse\r\nand three foot soldiers, according to the exigencies of the times when\r\nthe grant was conferred. The different grants[3.2.6] appended will show\r\nthis variety, and furnish additional proof that this, and all similar\r\nsystems of policy, must be much indebted to chance for the shape they\r\nultimately take. The knight’s fee, when William the Conqueror\r\npartitioned England into sixty thousand such portions, from each of\r\nwhich a soldier’s service was due, was fixed at £20. Each portion\r\nfurnished its soldier or paid escuage. The knight’s fee of Mewar may be\r\nsaid to be two hundred and fifty rupees, or about £30.\r\n\r\n=Limitations of Service.=—In Europe, service was so restricted that the\r\nmonarch had but a precarious authority. He could only calculate upon\r\nforty days’ annual service from the tenant of a knight’s fee. In\r\nRajasthan it is very different: “at home and abroad, service shall be\r\nperformed when demanded”; such is the condition of the tenure.\r\n\r\nFor state and show, a portion of the greater vassals[3.2.7] reside at\r\nthe capital for [148] some months, when they have permission to retire\r\nto their estates, and are relieved by another portion. On the grand\r\nmilitary festival the whole attend for a given time; and when the prince\r\ntook the field, the whole assembled at their own charge; but if\r\nhostilities carried them beyond the frontier they were allowed certain\r\nrations.\r\n\r\n=Escuage or Scutage.=—Escuage or scutage, the phrase in Europe to denote\r\nthe amercement[3.2.8] for non-attendance, is also known and exemplified\r\nin deeds. Failure from disaffection, turbulence, or pride, brought a\r\nheavy fine; the sequestration of the whole or part of the estate.[3.2.9]\r\nThe princes of these States would willingly desire to see escuage more\r\ngeneral. All have made this first attempt towards an approximation to a\r\nstanding army; but, though the chiefs would make compensation to get rid\r\nof some particular service, they are very reluctant to renounce lands,\r\nby which alone a fixed force could be maintained. The rapacity of the\r\ncourt would gladly fly to scutages, but in the present impoverished\r\nstate of the fiefs, such if injudiciously levied would be almost\r\nequivalent to resumption; but this measure is so full of difficulty as\r\nto be almost impracticable.\r\n\r\n=Inefficiency of this Form of Government.=—Throughout Rajasthan the\r\ncharacter and welfare of the States depend on that of the sovereign: he\r\nis the mainspring of the system—the active power to set and keep in\r\nmotion all these discordant materials; if he relax, each part separates,\r\nand moves in a narrow sphere of its own. Yet will the impulse of one\r\ngreat mind put the machine in regular movement, which shall endure\r\nduring two or three imbecile successors, if no fresh exterior force be\r\napplied to check it. It is a system full of defects; yet we see them so\r\noften balanced by virtues, that we are alternately biassed by these\r\ncounteracting qualities; loyalty and patriotism, which combine a love of\r\nthe institutions, religion, and manners of the country, are the\r\ncounterpoise to systematic evil. In no country has the system ever\r\nproved efficient. It has been one of eternal excitement and irregular\r\naction; inimical to order, and the repose deemed necessary after\r\nconflict for recruiting the national strength. The absence of an\r\nexternal foe was but the signal for disorders within, which increased to\r\na terrific height in the feuds of the two great rival factions of Mewar,\r\nthe clans of [149] Chondawat[3.2.10] and Saktawat,[3.2.11] as the\r\nweakness of the prince augmented by the abstraction of his personal\r\ndomain, and the diminution of the services of the third class of vassals\r\n(the Gol), the personal retainers of the crown; but when these feuds\r\nbroke out, even with the enemy at their gates, it required a prince of\r\ngreat nerve and talent to regulate them. Yet is there a redeeming\r\nquality in the system, which, imperfect as it is, could render such\r\nperilous circumstances but the impulse to a rivalry of heroism.\r\n\r\n=Rivalry of the Chondāwat and Saktāwat Sub-clans.=—When Jahangir had\r\nobtained possession of the palladium of Mewar, the ancient fortress of\r\nChitor, and driven the prince into the wilds and mountains of the west,\r\nan opportunity offered to recover some frontier lands in the plains, and\r\nthe Rana with all his chiefs was assembled for the purpose. But the\r\nSaktawats asserted an equal privilege with their rivals to form the\r\nvanguard;[3.2.12] a right which their indisputable valour (perhaps\r\nsuperior to that of the other party) rendered not invalid. The\r\nChondawats claimed it as an hereditary privilege, and the sword would\r\nhave decided the matter but for the tact of the prince. “The harawal to\r\nthe clan which first enters Untala,” was a decision which the Saktawat\r\nleader quickly heard; while the other could no longer plead his right,\r\nwhen such a gauntlet was thrown down for its maintenance.\r\n\r\nUntala is the frontier fortress in the plains, about eighteen miles east\r\nof the capital, and covering the road which leads from it to the more\r\nancient one of Chitor. It is situated on a rising ground, with a stream\r\nflowing beneath its walls, which are of solid masonry, lofty, and with\r\nround towers at intervals.[3.2.13] In the centre was the governor’s\r\nhouse, also fortified. One gate only gave admission to this castle.\r\n\r\nThe clans, always rivals in power, now competitors in glory, moved off\r\nat the same time, some hours before daybreak—Untala the goal, the\r\nharawal the reward! Animated with hope—a barbarous and cruel foe the\r\nobject of their prowess—their wives and families spectators, on their\r\nreturn, of the meed of enterprise; the bard [150], who sang the praise\r\nof each race at their outset, demanding of each materials for a new\r\nwreath, supplied every stimulus that a Rajput could have to exertion.\r\n\r\nThe Saktawats made directly for the gateway, which they reached as the\r\nday broke, and took the foe unprepared; but the walls were soon manned,\r\nand the action commenced. The Chondawats, less skilled in topography,\r\nhad traversed a swamp, which retarded them—but through which they\r\ndashed, fortunately meeting a guide in a shepherd of Untala. With more\r\nforesight than their opponents, they had brought ladders. The chief led\r\nthe escalade, but a ball rolled him back amidst his vassals; it was not\r\nhis destiny to lead the harawal! Each party was checked. The Saktawat\r\ndepended on the elephant he rode, to gain admission by forcing the gate;\r\nbut its projecting spikes deterred the animal from applying its\r\nstrength. His men were falling thick around him, when a shout from the\r\nother party made him dread their success. He descended from his seat,\r\nplaced his body on the spikes, and commanded the driver, on pain of\r\ninstant death, to propel the elephant against him. The gates gave way,\r\nand over the dead body of their chief his clan rushed to the combat! But\r\neven this heroic surrender of his life failed to purchase the honour for\r\nhis clan. The lifeless corpse of his rival was already in Untala, and\r\nthis was the event announced by the shout which urged his sacrifice to\r\nhonour and ambition. When the Chondawat chief fell, the next in rank and\r\nkin took the command. He was one of those arrogant, reckless Rajputs,\r\nwho signalized themselves wherever there was danger, not only against\r\nmen but tigers, and his common appellation was the Benda Thakur (‘mad\r\nchief’) of Deogarh. When his leader fell, he rolled the body in his\r\nscarf; then tying it on his back, scaled the wall, and with his lance\r\nhaving cleared the way before him he threw the dead body over the\r\nparapet of Untala, shouting, “The vanguard to the Chondawat! we are\r\nfirst in!” The shout was echoed by the clan, and the rampart was in\r\ntheir possession nearly at the moment of the entry of the Saktawats. The\r\nMoguls fell under their swords: the standard of Mewar was erected in the\r\ncastle of Untala, but the leading of the vanguard remained with the\r\nChondawats[3.2.14] [151].\r\n\r\nThis is not the sole instance of such jealousies being converted into a\r\ngenerous and patriotic rivalry; many others could be adduced throughout\r\nthe greater principalities, but especially amongst the brave Rathors of\r\nMarwar.\r\n\r\nIt was a nice point to keep these clans poised against each other; their\r\nfeuds were not without utility, and the tact of the prince frequently\r\nturned them to account. One party was certain to be enlisted on the side\r\nof the sovereign, and this alone counter-balanced the evil tendencies\r\nbefore described. To this day it has been a perpetual struggle for\r\nsupremacy; and the epithets of ‘loyalist’ and ‘traitor’ have been\r\nalternating between them for centuries, according to the portion they\r\nenjoyed of the prince’s favour, and the talents and disposition of the\r\nheads of the clans to maintain their predominance at court. The\r\nSaktawats are weaker in numbers, but have the reputation of greater\r\nbravery and more genius than their rivals. I am inclined, on the whole,\r\nto assent to this opinion; and the very consciousness of this reputation\r\nmust be a powerful incentive to its preservation.\r\n\r\nWhen all these governments were founded and maintained on the same\r\nprinciple, a system of feuds, doubtless, answered very well; but it\r\ncannot exist with a well-constituted monarchy. Where individual will\r\ncontrols the energies of a nation, it must eventually lose its\r\nliberties. To preserve their power, the princes of Rajasthan surrendered\r\na portion of theirs to the emperors of Delhi. They made a nominal\r\nsurrender to him of their kingdoms receiving them back with a sanad, or\r\ngrant, renewed on each lapse: thereby acknowledging him as lord\r\nparamount. They received, on these occasions, the khilat of honour and\r\ninvestiture, consisting of elephants, horses, arms, and jewels; and to\r\ntheir hereditary title of ‘prince’ was added by the emperor, one of\r\ndignity, _mansab_.[3.2.15] Besides this acknowledgment of supremacy,\r\nthey offered _nazarana_[3.2.16] and homage, especially on the festival\r\nof Nauroz (the new year), engaging to attend the royal presence when\r\nrequired, at the head of a stipulated number of their vassals. The\r\nemperor presented them with a royal standard, kettle-drums, and other\r\ninsignia, which headed the array of each prince. Here we have all the\r\nchief incidents of a great feudal sovereignty. Whether the Tatar\r\nsovereigns borrowed these customs from their princely vassals, or\r\nbrought them from the highlands of Asia, from the Oxus [152] and\r\nJaxartes, whence, there is little doubt, many of these Sachha Rajputs\r\noriginated, shall be elsewhere considered.\r\n\r\n=Akbar’s Policy towards the Rājputs.=—The splendour of such an array,\r\nwhether in the field or at the palace, can scarcely be conceived. Though\r\nHumayun had gained the services of some of the Rajput princes, their aid\r\nwas uncertain. It was reserved for his son, the wise and magnanimous\r\nAkbar, to induce them to become at once the ornament and support of his\r\nthrone. The power which he consolidated, and knew so well to wield, was\r\nirresistible; while the beneficence of his disposition, and the wisdom\r\nof his policy, maintained what his might conquered. He felt that a\r\nconstant exhibition of authority would not only be ineffectual but\r\ndangerous, and that the surest hold on their fealty and esteem would be\r\nthe giving them a personal interest in the support of the monarchy.\r\n\r\n=Alliances between Moguls and Rājputs.=—Akbar determined to unite the\r\npure Rajput blood to the scarcely less noble stream which flowed from\r\nAghuz Khan, through Jenghiz, Timur, and Babur, to himself, calculating\r\nthat they would more readily yield obedience to a prince who claimed\r\nkindred with them, than to one purely Tatar; and that, at all events, it\r\nwould gain the support of their immediate kin, and might in the end\r\nbecome general. In this supposition he did not err. We are less\r\nacquainted with the obstacles which opposed his first success than those\r\nhe subsequently encountered; one of which neither he nor his descendants\r\never overcame in the family of Mewar, who could never be brought to\r\nsubmit to such alliance.\r\n\r\nAmber, the nearest to Delhi and the most exposed, though more open to\r\ntemptation than to conquest, in its then contracted sphere, was the\r\nfirst to set the example.[3.2.17] Its Raja Bhagwandas gave his daughter\r\nto Humayun;[3.2.18] and subsequently this practice became so common,\r\nthat some of the most celebrated emperors were the offspring of Rajput\r\nprincesses. Of these, Salim, called after his accession, Jahangir; his\r\nill-fated son, Khusru; Shah Jahan;[3.2.19] Kambakhsh,[3.2.20] the\r\nfavourite of his father; Aurangzeb, and his rebellious son Akbar, whom\r\nhis Rajput kin would have placed on the throne had his genius equalled\r\ntheir power, are the most prominent instances. Farrukhsiyar, when the\r\nempire began to totter, furnished the last instance of a Mogul sovereign\r\n[153] marrying a Hindu princess,[3.2.21] the daughter of Raja Ajit\r\nSingh, sovereign of Marwar.\r\n\r\nThese Rajput princes became the guardians of the minority of their\r\nimperial nephews, and had a direct stake in the empire, and in the\r\naugmentation of their estates.\r\n\r\n=Rājputs in the Imperial Service.=—Of the four hundred and sixteen\r\nMansabdars, or military commanders of Akbar’s empire, from leaders of\r\ntwo hundred to ten thousand men, forty-seven were Rajputs, and the\r\naggregate of their quotas amounted to fifty-three thousand\r\nhorse:[3.2.22] exactly one-tenth of the united Mansabdars of the empire,\r\nor five hundred and thirty thousand horse.[3.2.23] Of the forty-seven\r\nRajput leaders, there were seventeen whose mansabs were from one\r\nthousand to five thousand horse, and thirty from two hundred to one\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nThe princes of Amber, Marwar, Bikaner, Bundi, Jaisalmer, Bundelkhand,\r\nand even Shaikhawati, held mansabs of above one thousand; but Amber\r\nonly, being allied to the throne, had the dignity of five thousand.\r\n\r\nThe Raja Udai Singh of Marwar, surnamed the Fat, chief of the Rathors,\r\nheld but the mansab of one thousand, while a scion of his house, Rae\r\nSingh of Bikaner, had four thousand. This is to be accounted for by the\r\ndignity being thrust upon the head of that house. The independent\r\nprinces of Chanderi, Karauli, Datia, with the tributary feudatories of\r\nthe larger principalities, and members of the Shaikhawat federation,\r\nwere enrolled on the other grades, from four to seven hundred. Amongst\r\nthese we find the founder of the Saktawat clan, who, quarrelling with\r\nhis brother, Rana Partap of Mewar, gave his services to Akbar. In short\r\nit became general, and what originated in force or persuasion, was soon\r\ncoveted from interested motives; and as nearly all the States submitted\r\nin [154] time to give queens to the empire, few were left to stigmatize\r\nthis dereliction from Hindu principle.\r\n\r\nAkbar thus gained a double victory, securing the good opinions as well\r\nas the swords of these princes in his aid. A judicious perseverance\r\nwould have rendered the throne of Timur immovable, had not the\r\ntolerant principles and beneficence of Akbar, Jahangir, and Shah Jahan\r\nbeen lost sight of by the bigoted and bloodthirsty Aurangzeb; who,\r\nalthough while he lived his commanding genius wielded the destinies of\r\nthis immense empire at pleasure, alienated the affections, by\r\ninsulting the prejudices, of those who had aided in raising the empire\r\nto the height on which it stood. This affection withdrawn, and the\r\nweakness of Farrukhsiyar substituted for the strength of Aurangzeb, it\r\nfell and went rapidly to pieces. Predatory warfare and spoliation rose\r\non its ruins. The Rajput princes, with a short-sighted policy, at\r\nfirst connived at, and even secretly invited the tumult; not\r\ncalculating on its affecting their interests. Each looked to the\r\nreturn of ancient independence, and several reckoned on great\r\naccession of power. Old jealousies were not lessened by the part which\r\neach had played in the hour of ephemeral greatness; and the prince of\r\nMewar, who preserved his blood uncontaminated, though with loss of\r\nland, was at once an object of respect and envy to those who had\r\nforfeited the first pretensions[3.2.24] of a Rajput. It was the only\r\novation the Sesodia[3.2.25] had to boast for centuries of oppression\r\nand spoliation, whilst their neighbours were basking in court favour.\r\nThe great increase of territory of these princes nearly equalled the\r\npower of Mewar, and the dignities thus acquired from the sons of\r\nTimur, they naturally wished should appear as distinguished as his\r\nancient title. Hence, while one inscribed on his seal “The exalted in\r\ndignity, a prince amongst princes, and king of kings,”[3.2.26] the\r\nprince of Mewar preserved his royal simplicity in “Maharana Bhima\r\nSingh, son of Arsi.” But this is digression.\r\n\r\n=Results of Feudalism.=—It would be difficult to say what would be the\r\nhappiest form of government for these States without reference to their\r\nneighbours. Their own feudal customs would seem to have worked well. The\r\nexperiment of centuries has secured [155] to them political existence,\r\nwhile successive dynasties of Afghans and Moguls, during eight hundred\r\nyears, have left but the wreck of splendid names. Were they to become\r\nmore monarchical, they would have everything to dread from unchecked\r\ndespotism, over which even the turbulence of their chiefs is a salutary\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nWere they somewhat more advanced towards prosperity, the crown demesne\r\nredeemed from dissipation and sterility, and the chiefs enabled to bring\r\ntheir quotas into play for protection and police, recourse should never\r\nbe had to bodies of mercenary troops, which practice, if persevered in,\r\nwill inevitably change their present form of government. This has\r\ninvariably been the result, in Europe as well as Rajasthan, else why the\r\ndread of standing armies?\r\n\r\n=Employment of Mercenaries.=—Escuage is an approximating step. When\r\nCharles VII. of France[3.2.27] raised his companies of ordnance, the\r\nbasis of the first national standing army ever embodied in Europe, a tax\r\ncalled ‘taille’ was imposed to pay them, and Guienne rebelled. Kotah is\r\na melancholy instance of subversion of the ancient order of society.\r\nMewar made the experiment from necessity sixty years ago, when rebellion\r\nand invasion conjoined; and a body of Sindis were employed, which\r\ncompleted their disgust, and they fought with each other till almost\r\nmutually exterminated, and till all faith in their prince was lost.\r\nJaipur had adopted this custom to a greater extent; but it was an\r\nill-paid band, neither respected at home nor feared abroad. In Marwar\r\nthe feudal compact was too strong to tolerate it, till Pathan predatory\r\nbands, prowling amidst the ruins of Mogul despotism, were called in to\r\npartake in each family broil; the consequence was the weakening of all,\r\nand opening the door to a power stronger than any, to be the arbiter of\r\ntheir fate.\r\n\r\n=General Duties of the Pattāwat, or Vassal Chief of Rājasthān.=—“The\r\nessential principle of a fief was a mutual contract of support and\r\nfidelity. Whatever obligations it laid upon the vassal of service to his\r\nlord, corresponding duties of protection were imposed by it on the lord\r\ntowards his vassal. If these were transgressed on either side, the one\r\nforfeited his land, the other his signiory or rights over it.”[3.2.28]\r\nIn this is comprehended the very foundation of feudal policy, because in\r\nits simplicity we recognize first principles involving mutual\r\npreservation. The best [156] commentary on this definition of simple\r\ntruth will be the sentiments of the Rajputs themselves in two papers:\r\none containing the opinions of the chiefs of Marwar on the reciprocal\r\nduties of sovereign and vassal;[3.2.29] the other, those of the\r\nsub-vassals of Deogarh, one of the largest fiefs in Rajasthan, of their\r\nrights, the infringement of them, and the remedy.[3.2.30]\r\n\r\nIf, at any former period in the history of Marwar, its prince had thus\r\ndared to act, his signiory and rights over it would not have been of\r\ngreat value; his crown and life would both have been endangered by these\r\nturbulent and determined vassals. How much is comprehended in that\r\nmanly, yet respectful sentence: “If he accepts our services, then he is\r\nour prince and leader; if not, but our equal, and we again his brothers,\r\nclaimants of and laying claim to the soil.” In the remonstrance of the\r\nsub-vassals of Deogarh, we have the same sentiments on a reduced scale.\r\nIn both we have the ties of blood and kindred, connected with and\r\nstrengthening national policy. If a doubt could exist as to the\r\nprinciple of fiefs being similar in Rajasthan and in Europe, it might be\r\nset at rest by the important question long agitated by the feodal\r\nlawyers in Europe, “whether the vassal is bound to follow the standard\r\nof his lord against his own kindred or against his sovereign”: which in\r\nthese States is illustrated by a simple and universal proof. If the\r\nquestion were put to a Rajput to whom his service is due, whether to his\r\nchief or his sovereign, the reply would be, _Raj ka malik wuh,\r\npat[3.2.31] ka malik yih_: ‘He is the sovereign of the State, but this\r\nis my _head_’: an ambiguous phrase, but well understood to imply that\r\nhis own immediate chief is the only authority he regards.\r\n\r\nThis will appear to militate against the right of remonstrance (as in\r\nthe case of the vassals of Deogarh), for they look to the crown for\r\nprotection against injustice; they annihilate other rights by admitting\r\nappeal higher than this. Every class looks out for some resource against\r\noppression. The sovereign is the last applied to on such occasions, with\r\nwhom the sub-vassal has no bond of connexion. He can receive no favour,\r\nnor perform any service, but through his own immediate superior; and\r\npresumes not to question (in cases not personal to himself) the\r\npropriety of his chief’s actions, adopting implicitly his feelings [157]\r\nand resentments. The daily familiar intercourse of life is far too\r\nengrossing to allow him to speculate, and with his lord he lives a\r\npatriot or dies a traitor. In proof of this, numerous instances could be\r\ngiven of whole clans devoting themselves to the chief against their\r\nsovereign;[3.2.32] not from the ties of kindred, for many were aliens to\r\nblood; but from the ties of duty, gratitude, and all that constitutes\r\nclannish attachment, superadded to feudal obligation. The sovereign, as\r\nbefore observed, has nothing to do with those vassals not holding\r\ndirectly from the crown; and those who wish to stand well with their\r\nchiefs would be very slow in receiving any honours or favours from the\r\ngeneral fountain-head. The Deogarh chief sent one of his sub-vassals to\r\ncourt on a mission; his address and deportment gained him favour, and\r\nhis consequence was increased by a seat in the presence of his\r\nsovereign. When he returned, he found this had lost him the favour of\r\nhis chief, who was offended, and conceived a jealousy both of his prince\r\nand his servant. The distinction paid to the latter was, he said,\r\nsubversive of his proper authority, and the vassal incurred by his\r\nvanity the loss of estimation where alone it was of value.\r\n\r\n=Obligations of a Vassal.=—The attempt to define all the obligations of\r\na vassal would be endless: they involve all the duties of kindred in\r\naddition to those of obedience. To attend the court of his chief; never\r\nto absent himself without leave; to ride with him a-hunting; to attend\r\nhim at the court of his sovereign or to war, and even give himself as a\r\nhostage for his release; these are some of the duties of a vassal.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.2.1:\r\n\r\n  Literally ‘terrace,’ or ‘altar.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.2.2:\r\n\r\n  [Headman and accountant.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.2.3:\r\n\r\n  They were considered a sort of jury, bearing a close analogy to the\r\n  _judices selecti_, who sat with the praetor in the tribunal of Rome\r\n  (Hallam).\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.2.4:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix, No. III.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.2.5:\r\n\r\n  Family priest.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.2.6:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix, Nos.

The feuds of these two clans, like those of the Armagnacs and\r\n  Bourguignons, “qui couvrirent la France d’un crêpe sanglant,” have\r\n  been the destruction of Mewar. It requires but a change of names and\r\n  places, while reading the one, to understand perfectly the history of\r\n  the other.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.2.12:\r\n\r\n  Harāwal.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.2.13:\r\n\r\n  It is now in ruins, but the towers and part of the walls are still\r\n  standing.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.2.14:\r\n\r\n  An anecdote appended by my friend Amra (the bard of the Sangawats, a\r\n  powerful division of the Chondawats, whose head is Deogarh, often\r\n  alluded to, and who alone used to lead two thousand vassals into the\r\n  field) was well attested. Two Mogul chiefs of note were deeply engaged\r\n  in a game of chess when the tumult was reported to them. Feeling\r\n  confident of success, they continued their game; nor would they desist\r\n  till the inner castle of this ‘donjon keep’ was taken, and they were\r\n  surrounded by the Rajputs, when they coolly begged they might be\r\n  allowed to terminate their game. This the enemy granted; but the loss\r\n  of their chiefs had steeled their breasts against mercy, and they were\r\n  afterwards put to death. [Compare the similar case of Ganga, Rāja of\r\n  Mysore, who was surprised, by the treachery of his ministers, while\r\n  occupied in a game of chess (L. Rice, _Mysore Gazetteer_ (1897), 1i.\r\n  319.)]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.2.15:\r\n\r\n  [‘Office, prerogative.’ For a full account of the Mansab system, see\r\n  Irvine, _Army of the Indian Moghuls_, 3 ff.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.2.16:\r\n\r\n  Fine of relief.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.2.17:\r\n\r\n  [There were earlier instances of alliances between Muhammadan princes\r\n  and Hindus.

When the\r\n  nuptials were preparing, the emperor fell ill. A mission was at that\r\n  time at Delhi from Surat, where we traded, of which Mr. Hamilton was\r\n  the surgeon. He cured the king, and the marriage was completed. In the\r\n  oriental style, he desired the doctor to name his reward; but instead\r\n  of asking anything for himself, he demanded a grant of land for a\r\n  factory on the Hoogly for his employers. It was accorded, and this was\r\n  the origin of the greatness of the British empire in the East. Such an\r\n  act deserved at least a column; but neither “storied urn nor animated\r\n  bust” marks the spot where his remains are laid [C. R.

These were six in number:\r\n1. Reliefs; 2. Fines of alienation; 3. Escheats; 4. Aids; 5. Wardship;\r\n6. Marriage [158].\r\n\r\n=Relief.=—The first and most essential mark of a feudal relation exists\r\nin all its force and purity here: it is a perpetually recurring mark of\r\nthe source of the grant, and the solemn renewal of the pledge which\r\noriginally obtained it. In Mewar it is a virtual and _bona fide_\r\nsurrender of the fief and renewal thereof. It is thus defined in\r\nEuropean polity: “A relief[3.3.1] is a sum of money due from every one\r\nof full age taking a fief by descent.” It was arbitrary, and the\r\nconsequent exactions formed a ground of discontent; nor was the tax\r\nfixed till a comparatively recent period.\r\n\r\nBy Magna Charta reliefs were settled at rates proportionate to the\r\ndignity of the holder.[3.3.2] In France the relief was fixed by the\r\ncustomary laws at one year’s revenue.[3.3.3] This last has long been the\r\nsettled amount of _nazarana_, or fine of relief, in Mewar.\r\n\r\n=Fine paid on Succession.=—On the demise of a chief, the prince\r\nimmediately sends a party, termed the _zabti_ (sequestrator), consisting\r\nof a civil officer and a few soldiers, who take possession of the State\r\nin the prince’s name. The heir sends his prayer to court to be installed\r\nin the property, offering the proper relief. This paid, the chief is\r\ninvited to repair to the presence, when he performs homage, and makes\r\nprotestations of service and fealty; he receives a fresh grant, and the\r\ninauguration terminates by the prince girding him with a sword, in the\r\nold forms of chivalry. It is an imposing ceremony, performed in a full\r\nassembly of the court, and one of the few which has never been\r\nrelinquished. The fine paid, and the brand buckled to his side, a steed,\r\nturban, plume, and dress of honour given to the chief, the\r\ninvestiture[3.3.4] is [159] complete; the sequestrator returns to court,\r\nand the chief to his estate, to receive the vows and congratulations of\r\nhis vassals.[3.3.5]\r\n\r\nIn this we plainly perceive the original power (whether exercised or\r\nnot) of resumption. On this subject more will appear in treating of the\r\nduration of grants. The _kharg bandhai_, or ‘binding of the sword,’ is\r\nalso performed when a Rajput is fit to bear arms; as amongst the ancient\r\nGerman tribes, when they put into the hands of the aspirant for fame a\r\nlance. Such are the substitutes for the _toga virilis_ of the young\r\nRoman. The Rana himself is thus ordained a knight by the first of his\r\nvassals in dignity, the chief of Salumbar.\r\n\r\n=Renunciation of Reliefs.=—In the demoralization of all those States,\r\nsome of the chiefs obtained renunciation of the fine of relief, which\r\nwas tantamount to making a grant in perpetuity, and annulling the most\r\novert sign of paramount sovereignty. But these and many other important\r\nencroachments were made when little remained of the reality, or when it\r\nwas obscured by a series of oppressions unexampled in any European\r\nState.\r\n\r\nIt is in Mewar alone, I believe, of all Rajasthan, that these marks of\r\nfealty are observable to such an extent. But what is remarked elsewhere\r\nupon the fiefs being movable, will support the doctrine of resumption\r\nthough it might not be practised: a prerogative may exist without its\r\nbeing exercised.\r\n\r\n=Fine of Alienation.=—Rajasthan never attained this refinement\r\nindicative of the dismemberment of the system; so vicious and\r\nself-destructive a notion never had existence in these States.\r\nAlienation does not belong to a system of fiefs: the lord would never\r\nconsent to it, but on very peculiar occasions.\r\n\r\nIn Cutch, amongst the Jareja[3.3.6] tribes, sub-vassals may alienate\r\ntheir estates; but this privilege is dependent on the mode of\r\nacquisition. Perhaps the only knowledge we have in Rajasthan of\r\nalienation requiring the sanction of the lord paramount, is in donations\r\nfor pious uses: but this is partial. We see in the remonstrance of the\r\nDeogarh vassals the opinion they entertained of their lord’s alienation\r\nof their sub-fees to strangers, and without the Rana’s consent; which,\r\nwith a similar train of conduct, produced sequestration of his fief till\r\nthey were reinducted [160].\r\n\r\n=Tenants of the Crown may Alienate.=—The agricultural tenants,\r\nproprietors of land held of the crown, may alienate their rights upon a\r\nsmall fine, levied merely to mark the transaction. But the tenures of\r\nthese non-combatants and the holders of fees are entirely distinct, and\r\ncannot here be entered on, further than to say that the agriculturist\r\nis, or was, the proprietor of the soil; the chief, solely of the tax\r\nlevied thereon. But in Europe the alienation of the _feudum paternum_\r\nwas not good without the consent of the kindred in the line of\r\nsuccession.[3.3.7] This would involve sub-infeudation and frerage, which\r\nI shall touch on distinctly, many of the troubles of these countries\r\narising therefrom.\r\n\r\n=Escheats and Forfeitures.=—The fiefs which were only to descend in\r\nlineal succession reverted to the crown on failure of heirs, as they\r\ncould not be bequeathed by will. This answers equally well for England\r\nas for Mewar. I have witnessed escheats of this kind, and foresee more,\r\nif the pernicious practice of unlimited adoption do not prevent the Rana\r\nfrom regaining lands, alienated by himself at periods of contention.\r\nForfeitures for crimes must, of course, occur, and these are partial or\r\nentire, according to the delinquency.\r\n\r\nIn Marwar, at this moment, nearly all the representatives of the great\r\nfiefs of that country are exiles from their homes: a distant branch of\r\nthe same family, the prince of Idar, would have adopted a similar line\r\nof conduct but for a timely check from the hand of benevolence.[3.3.8]\r\n\r\nThere is, or rather was, a class of lands in Mewar appended to the\r\ncrown, of which it bestowed life-rents on men of merit. These were\r\ntermed Chhorutar, and were given and taken back, as the name implies; in\r\ncontradistinction to grants which, though originating in good behaviour,\r\nnot only continued for life but descended in perpetuity. Such places are\r\nstill so marked in the rent-roll, but they are seldom applied to the\r\nproper purpose.\r\n\r\n=Aids.=—Aids, implying ‘free gifts,’ or ‘benevolences,’ as they were\r\ntermed in a European code, are well known. The _barar_ (war-tax) is well\r\nunderstood in Mewar, and is levied on many occasions for the necessities\r\nof the prince or the head of a clan. It is a curious fact, that the\r\n_dasaundh_, or ‘tenth,’ in Mewar, as in Europe, was the [161] stated sum\r\nto be levied in periods of emergency or danger. On the marriage of the\r\ndaughters of the prince, a benevolence or contribution was always\r\nlevied: this varied. A few years ago, when two daughters and a\r\ngranddaughter were married to the princes of Jaisalmer, Bikaner, and\r\nKishangarh, a schedule of one-sixth, to portion the three, was made out;\r\nbut it did not realize above an eighth. In this aid the civil officers\r\nof government contribute equally with the others. It is a point of\r\nhonour with all to see their sovereign’s daughters married, and for once\r\nthe contribution merited the name of benevolence. But it is not levied\r\nsolely from the coffers of the rich; by the chiefs it is exacted of\r\ntheir tenantry of all classes, who, of course, wish such subjects of\r\nrejoicing to be of as rare occurrence as possible.\r\n\r\n“These feudal aids are deserving of our notice as the commencement of\r\ntaxation, of which they long answered the purpose, till the craving\r\nnecessities and covetous policy of kings established for them more\r\ndurable and onerous burthens.”[3.3.9]\r\n\r\nThe great chiefs, it may be assumed, were not backward, on like\r\noccasions, to follow such examples, but these gifts were more voluntary.\r\nOf the details of aids in France we find enumerated, “paying the relief\r\nof the suzerain on taking possession of his lands”;[3.3.10] and by Magna\r\nCharta our barons could levy them on the following counts: to make the\r\nbaron’s eldest son a knight, to marry his eldest daughter, or to redeem\r\nhis person from captivity. The latter is also one occasion for the\r\ndemand in all these countries. The chief is frequently made prisoner in\r\ntheir predatory invasions, and carried off as a hostage for the payment\r\nof a war contribution. Everything disposable is often got rid of on an\r\noccasion of this kind. Cœur de Lion would not have remained so long\r\nin the dungeons of Austria had his subjects been Rajputs. In Amber the\r\nmost extensive benevolence, or _barar_,[3.3.11] is on the marriage of\r\nthe Rajkumar, or heir apparent.\r\n\r\n=Wardship.=—This does exist, to foster the infant vassal during\r\nminority; but often terminating, as in the system of Europe, in the\r\nnefarious act of defrauding a helpless infant, to the pecuniary benefit\r\nof some court favourite. It is accordingly [162] here undertaken\r\noccasionally by the head of the clan; but two strong recent instances\r\nbrought the dark ages, and the purchase of wardships for the purpose of\r\nspoliation, to mind. The first was in the Deogarh chief obtaining by\r\nbribe the entire management of the lands of Sangramgarh, on pretence of\r\nimproving them for the infant, Nahar Singh, whose father was\r\nincapacitated by derangement. Nahar was a junior branch of the clan\r\nSangawat, a subdivision of the Chondawat clan, both Sesodias of the\r\nRana’s blood. The object, at the time, was to unite them to Deogarh,\r\nthough he pleaded duty as head of the clan. His nomination of young\r\nNahar as his own heir gives a colouring of truth to his intentions; and\r\nhe succeeded, though there were nearer of kin, who were set aside (at\r\nthe wish of the vassals of Deogarh and with the concurrence of the\r\nsovereign) as unfit to head them or serve him.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of the danger of permitting wardships, particularly\r\nwhere the guardian is the superior in clanship and kindred, is\r\nexemplified in the Kalyanpur estate in Mewar. That property had been\r\nderived from the crown only two generations back, and was of the annual\r\nvalue of ten thousand rupees. The mother having little interest at\r\ncourt, the Salumbar chief, by bribery and intrigue, upon paying a fine\r\nof about one year’s rent, obtained possession—ostensibly to guard the\r\ninfant’s rights; but the falsehood of this motive was soon apparent.\r\nThere were duties to perform on holding it which were not thought of. It\r\nwas a frontier post, and a place of rendezvous for the quotas to defend\r\nthat border from the incursions of the wild tribes of the south-west.\r\nThe Salumbar chief, being always deficient in the quota for his own\r\nestate, was not likely to be very zealous in his muster-roll for his\r\nward’s, and complaints were made which threatened a change. The chief of\r\nChawand was talked of as one who would provide for the widow and minor,\r\nwho could not perform the duties of defence.\r\n\r\nThe sovereign himself often assumes the guardianship of minors; but the\r\nmother is generally considered the most proper guardian for her infant\r\nson. All others may have interests of their own; she can be actuated by\r\nhis welfare alone. Custom, therefore, constitutes her the guardian; and\r\nwith the assistance of the elders of the family, she rears and educates\r\nthe young chief till he is fit to be girded with the sword\r\n[163].[3.3.12]\r\n\r\nThe Faujdar, or military manager, who frequently regulates the household\r\nas well as the subdivisions of the estate, is seldom of the kin or clan\r\nof the chief: a wise regulation, the omission of which has been known to\r\nproduce, in these _maires du palais_ on a small scale, the same results\r\nas will be described in the larger. This officer, and the civil\r\nfunctionary who transacts all the pecuniary concerns of the estate, with\r\nthe mother and her family, are always considered to be the proper\r\nguardians of the minor. ‘Blood which could not inherit,’ was the\r\nrequisite for a guardian in Europe,[3.3.13] as here; and when neglected,\r\nthe results are in both cases the same.\r\n\r\n=Marriage.=—Refinement was too strong on the side of the Rajput to admit\r\nthis incident, which, with that of wardship (both partial in Europe),\r\nillustrated the rapacity of the feudal aristocracy. Every chief, before\r\nhe marries, makes it known to his sovereign. It is a compliment which is\r\nexpected, and is besides attended with some advantage, as the prince\r\ninvariably confers presents of honour, according to the station of the\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nNo Rajput can marry in his own clan; and the incident was originated in\r\nthe Norman institutes, to prevent the vassal marrying out of his class,\r\nor amongst the enemies of his sovereign.[3.3.14]\r\n\r\nThus, setting aside marriage (which even in Europe was only partial and\r\nlocal) and alienation, four of the six chief incidents marking the\r\nfeudal system are in force in Rajasthan, viz. relief, escheats, aids,\r\nand wardships.\r\n\r\n=Duration of Grants.=—I shall now endeavour to combine all the knowledge\r\nI possess with regard to the objects attained in granting lands, the\r\nnature and durability of these grants, whether for life and renewable,\r\nor in perpetuity. I speak of the rules as understood in Mewar. We ought\r\nnot to expect much system in what was devoid of regularity, even\r\naccording to the old principles of European feudal law, which, though\r\nnow reduced to some fixed principles, originated in, and was governed\r\nby, fortuitous circumstances; and after often changing its character,\r\nended in despotism, oligarchy, or democracy.\r\n\r\n=Classes of Landholders.=—There are two classes of Rajput landholders in\r\nMewar, though the one greatly exceeds the other in number. One is the\r\nGirasia Thakur, or lord; the other the Bhumia. The Girasia chieftain is\r\nhe who holds (_giras_) by grant (_patta_) of the [164] prince, for which\r\nhe performs service with specified quotas at home and abroad, renewable\r\nat every lapse, when all the ceremonies of resumption,[3.3.15] the fine\r\nof relief,[3.3.16] and the investiture take place.\r\n\r\nThe Bhumia does not renew his grant, but holds on prescriptive\r\npossession. He succeeds without any fine, but pays a small annual\r\nquit-rent, and can be called upon for local service in the district\r\nwhich he inhabits for a certain period of time. He is the counterpart of\r\nthe allodial proprietor of the European system, and the real zamindar of\r\nthese principalities. Both have the same signification; from _bhum_ and\r\n_zamin_, ‘land’: the latter is an exotic of Persian origin.\r\n\r\n=Girāsia.=—Girasia is from _giras_, ‘a subsistence’; literally and\r\nfamiliarly ‘a mouthful.’ Whether it may have a like origin with the\r\nCeltic word _gwas_,[3.3.17] said to mean ‘a servant,’[3.3.18] and whence\r\nthe word vassal is derived, I shall leave to etymologists to decide, who\r\nmay trace the resemblance to the _girasia_, the vassal chieftain of the\r\nRajputs. All the chartularies or pattas[3.3.19] commence, \"To ...\r\n_giras_ has been ordained.\"\r\n\r\n=Whether Resumable.=—It has always been a subject of doubt whether\r\ngrants were resumable at pleasure, or without some delinquency imputable\r\nto the vassal. Their duration in Europe was, at least, the life of the\r\npossessor, when they reverted[3.3.20] to the fisc. The whole of the\r\nceremonies in cases of such lapse are decisive on this point in Mewar.\r\nThe right to resume, therefore, may be presumed to exist; while the\r\nnon-practice of it, the formalities of renewal being gone through, may\r\nbe said to render the right a dead letter. But to prove its existence I\r\nneed only mention, that so late as the reign of Rana Sangram,[3.3.21]\r\nthe fiefs of Mewar were actually movable; and little more than a century\r\nand a half has passed since this practice ceased. Thus a Rathor would\r\nshift, with family, chattels, and retainers, from the north into the\r\nwilds of Chappan;[3.3.22] while the Saktawat relieved would occupy the\r\nplains at the foot of the Aravalli;[3.3.23] or a Chondawat would\r\nexchange his [165] abode on the banks of the Chambal with a Pramara or\r\nChauhan from the table-mountain, the eastern boundary of Mewar.[3.3.24]\r\n\r\nSince these exchanges were occurring, it is evident the fiefs (_pattas_)\r\nwere not grants in perpetuity. This is just the state of the benefices\r\nin France at an early period, as described by Gibbon, following\r\nMontesquieu: “Les bénéfices étoient amovibles; bientôt ils les rendirent\r\nperpétuels, et enfin héréditaires.”[3.3.25] This is the precise\r\ngradation of fiefs in Mewar; movable, perpetual, and then hereditary.\r\nThe sons were occasionally permitted to succeed their fathers;[3.3.26]\r\nan indulgence which easily grew into a right, though the crown had the\r\nindubitable reversion. It is not, however, impossible that these\r\nchanges[3.3.27] were not of ancient authority, but arose from the policy\r\nof the times to prevent infidelity.\r\n\r\nWe ought to have a high opinion of princes who could produce an effect\r\nso powerful on the minds of a proud and turbulent nobility. The son was\r\nheir to the title and power over the vassals’ personals and movables,\r\nand to the allegiance of his father, but to nothing which could endanger\r\nthat allegiance.\r\n\r\nA proper apportioning and mixture of the different clans was another\r\ngood result to prevent their combinations in powerful families, which\r\ngave effect to rebellion, and has tended more than external causes to\r\nthe ruin which the State of Mewar exhibits.\r\n\r\n=Nobility: Introduction of Foreign Stocks.=—Throughout the various\r\ngradations of its nobility, it was the original policy to introduce some\r\nwho were foreign in country and blood. Chiefs of the Rathor, Chauhan,\r\nPramara, Solanki, and Bhatti tribes were intermingled. Of these several\r\nwere lineal descendants of the most ancient races of the kings of Delhi\r\nand Anhilwara Patan;[3.3.28] and from these, in order to preserve the\r\npurity of blood, the princes of Mewar took their wives, when the other\r\nprinces of Hind assented to [166] the degradation of giving daughters in\r\nmarriage to the emperors of Delhi. The princes of Mewar never yielded in\r\nthis point, but preserved their ancient manners amidst all vicissitudes.\r\nIn like manner did the nobles of the Rana’s blood take daughters from\r\nthe same tribes; the interest of this foreign race was therefore\r\nstrongly identified with the general welfare, and on all occasions of\r\ninternal turmoil and rebellion they invariably supported their prince.\r\nBut when these wise institutions were overlooked, when the great clans\r\nincreased and congregated together, and the crown demesne was\r\nimpoverished by prodigality, rebellions were fostered by Mahratta\r\nrapacity, which were little known during the lengthened paramount sway\r\nof the kings of Delhi. This foreign admixture will lead us to the\r\ndiscussion of the different kinds of grants: a difference, perhaps, more\r\nnominal than real, but exhibiting a distinction so wide as to imply\r\ngrants resumable and irresumable.\r\n\r\n=Kāla Pattas.=—It is elsewhere related that two great clans, descendants\r\nof the Ranas Rae Mall and Udai Singh, and their numerous scions, forming\r\nsubdivisions with separate titles or patronymics, compose the chief\r\nvassalage of this country.\r\n\r\n=Exogamy.=—Chondawat and Saktawat are the stock; the former is\r\nsubdivided into ten, the latter into about six clans. Rajputs never\r\nintermarry with their own kin: the prohibition has no limit; it extends\r\nto the remotest degree. All these clans are resolvable into the generic\r\nterm of ‘the race’ or Kula Sesodia. A Sesodia man and woman cannot unite\r\nin wedlock—all these are therefore of the blood royal; and the essayists\r\non population would have had a fine field in these quarters a century\r\nago, ere constant misery had thinned the country, to trace the numerous\r\nprogeny of Chonda and Sakta in the Genesis[3.3.29] of Mewar. The Bhat’s\r\ngenealogies would still, to a certain extent, afford the same means.\r\n\r\nDescent gives a strength to the tenure of these tribes which the foreign\r\nnobles do not possess; for although, from all that has been said, it\r\nwill be evident that a right of reversion and resumption existed (though\r\nseldom exercised, and never but in cases of crime), yet the foreigner\r\nhad not this strength in the soil, even though of twenty generations’\r\nduration. The epithet of _kala patta_, or ‘black grant,’ attaches to the\r\nforeign grant, and is admitted by the holder, from which the kinsman\r\nthinks himself exempt. It is virtually a grant resumable; nor can the\r\npossessors feel that security which the other widely affiliated\r\naristocracies afford [167]. When, on a recent occasion, a revision of\r\nall the grants took place, the old ones being called in to be renewed\r\nunder the sign-manual of the reigning prince, the minister himself\r\nvisited the chief of Salumbar, the head of the Chondawats, at his\r\nresidence at the capital, for this purpose. Having become possessed of\r\nseveral villages in the confusion of the times, a perusal of the grant\r\nwould have been the means of detection; and on being urged to send to\r\nhis estate for it, he replied, pointing to the palace, “My grant is in\r\nthe foundation of that edifice”: an answer worthy of a descendant of\r\nChonda, then only just of age. The expression marks the spirit which\r\nanimates this people, and recalls to mind the well-known reply of our\r\nown Earl Warenne, on the very same occasion, to the _quo warranto_ of\r\nEdward: “By their swords my ancestors obtained this land, and by mine\r\nwill I maintain it.”\r\n\r\nHence it may be pronounced that a grant of an estate is for the life of\r\nthe holder, with inheritance for his offspring in lineal descent or\r\nadoption, with the sanction of the prince, and resumable for crime or\r\nincapacity:[3.3.30] this reversion and power of resumption being marked\r\nby the usual ceremonies on each lapse of the grantee, of sequestration\r\n(_zabti_), of relief (_nazarana_), of homage and investiture of the\r\nheir. Those estates held by foreign nobles differ not in tenure; though,\r\nfor the reasons specified, they have not the same grounds of security as\r\nthe others, in whose welfare the whole body is interested, feeling the\r\ncase to be their own: and their interests, certainly, have not been so\r\nconsulted since the rebellions of S. 1822,[3.3.31] and subsequent years.\r\nWitness the Chauhans of Bedla and Kotharia (in the Udaipur valley), and\r\nthe Pramar of the plateau of Mewar, all chiefs of the first rank.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty and danger of resuming an old-established grant in these\r\ncountries are too great to be lightly risked. Though in all these\r\nestates there is a mixture of foreign Rajputs, yet the blood of the\r\nchief predominates; and these must have a leader of their own, or be\r\nincorporated in the estates of the nearest of kin. This increase might\r\nnot be desirable for the crown, but the sub-vassals cannot be turned\r\n[168] adrift; a resumption therefore in these countries is widely felt,\r\nas it involves many. If crime or incapacity render it necessary, the\r\nprince inducts a new head of that blood; and it is their pride, as well\r\nas the prince’s interest, that a proper choice should be made. If, as\r\nhas often occurred, the title be abolished, the sub-vassals retain their\r\nsub-infeudations, and become attached to the crown.\r\n\r\nMany estates were obtained, during periods of external commotion, by\r\nthreats, combination, or the avarice of the prince—his short-sighted\r\npolicy, or that of his ministers—which have been remedied in the late\r\nreorganization of Mewar; where, by retrograding half a century, and\r\nbringing matters as near as possible to the period preceding civil\r\ndissension, they have advanced at least a century towards order.\r\n\r\n=Bhūmia, the Allodial Proprietor.=—It is stated in the historical annals\r\nof this country that the ancient clans, prior to Sanga Rana,[3.3.32] had\r\nceased, on the rising greatness of the subsequent new division of clans,\r\nto hold the higher grades of rank; and had, in fact, merged into the\r\ngeneral military landed proprietors of this country under the term\r\n_bhumia_, a most expressive and comprehensive name, importing absolute\r\nidentity with the soil: _bhum_ meaning ‘land,’ and being far more\r\nexpressive than the newfangled word, unknown to Hindu India, of\r\n_zamindar_, the ‘land-holder’ of Muhammadan growth. These Bhumias, the\r\nscions of the earliest princes, are to be met with in various parts of\r\nMewar; though only in those of high antiquity, where they were defended\r\nfrom oppression by the rocks and wilds in which they obtained a footing;\r\nas in Kumbhalmer, the wilds of Chappan, or plains of Mandalgarh, long\r\nunder the kings, and where their agricultural pursuits maintained them.\r\n\r\nTheir clannish appellations, Kumbhawat, Lunawat, and Ranawat, distinctly\r\nshow from what stem and when they branched off; and as they ceased to be\r\nof sufficient importance to visit the court on the new and continually\r\nextending ramifications, they took to the plough. But while they\r\ndisdained not to derive a subsistence from labouring as husbandmen, they\r\nnever abandoned their arms; and the Bhumia, amid the crags of the alpine\r\nAravalli where he pastures his cattle or cultivates his fields,\r\npreserves the erect mien and proud spirit of his ancestors, with more\r\ntractability, and less arrogance and folly, than his more [169] courtly\r\nbut now widely separated brethren, who often make a jest of his\r\nindustrious but less refined qualifications.[3.3.33] Some of these yet\r\npossess entire villages, which are subject to the payment of a small\r\nquit-rent: they also constitute a local militia, to be called in by the\r\ngovernor of the district, but for which service they are entitled to\r\nrations or _peti_.[3.3.34] These, the allodial[3.3.35] tenantry of our\r\nfeudal system, form a considerable body in many districts, armed with\r\nmatchlock, sword, and shield. In Mandalgarh, when their own interests\r\nand the prince’s unite (though the rapacity of governors, pupils of the\r\nMahratta and other predatory schools, have disgusted these\r\nindependents), four thousand Bhumias could be collected. They held and\r\nmaintained without support the important fortress of that district,\r\nduring half a century of turmoil, for their prince. Mandalgarh is the\r\nlargest district of Mewar, and in its three hundred and sixty towns and\r\nvillages many specimens of ancient usage may be found. The Solanki held\r\nlargely here in ancient days, and the descendant of the princes of Patan\r\nstill retains his Bhum and title of Rao.[3.3.36]\r\n\r\n=Feudal Militia.=—All this feudal militia pay a quit-rent to the crown,\r\nand perform local but limited service on the frontier garrison; and upon\r\ninvasion,[3.3.37] when the _Kher_ is called out, the whole are at the\r\ndisposal of the prince on furnishing rations only. They assert that they\r\nought not to pay this quit-rent and perform service also; but this may\r\nbe doubted, since the sum is so small. To elude it, they often performed\r\nservice under some powerful chief, where faction or court interest [170]\r\ncaused it to be winked at. To serve without a _patta_ is the great\r\nobject of ambition. _Ma ka bhum_, ‘my land,’ in their Doric tongue, is a\r\nfavourite phrase.[3.3.38]\r\n\r\nCircumstances have concurred to produce a resemblance even to the\r\nrefined fiction of giving up their allodial property to have it\r\nconferred as a fief. But in candour it should be stated, that the only\r\ninstances were caused by the desire of being revenged on the immediate\r\nsuperiors of the vassals. The Rathor chief of Dabla held of his\r\nsuperior, the Raja of Banera, three considerable places included in the\r\ngrant of Banera. He paid homage, an annual quit-rent, was bound to\r\nattend him personally to court, and to furnish thirty-five horse in case\r\nof an invasion. During the troubles, though perfectly equal to their\r\nperformance, he was remiss in all these duties. His chief, with\r\nreturning peace, desired to enforce the return to ancient customs, and\r\nhis rights so long withheld; but the Rathor had felt the sweets of\r\nentire independence, and refused to attend his summons. To the warrant\r\nhe replied, “his head and Dabla were together”; and he would neither pay\r\nthe quit-rent nor attend his court. This refractory spirit was reported\r\nto the Rana; and it ended in Dabla being added to the fisc, and the\r\nchief’s holding the rest as a vassal of the Rana, but only to perform\r\nlocal service. There are many other petty free proprietors on the Banera\r\nestate, holding from small portions of land to small villages; but the\r\nservice is limited and local in order to swell the chief’s miniature\r\ncourt. If they accompany him, he must find rations for them and their\r\nsteeds.\r\n\r\nSo cherished is this tenure of Bhum, that the greatest chiefs are always\r\nsolicitous to obtain it, even in the villages wholly dependent on their\r\nauthority: a decided proof of its durability above common grants. The\r\nvarious modes in which it is acquired, and the precise technicalities\r\nwhich distinguished its tenure, as well as the privileges attached to\r\nit, are fully developed in translations of different deeds on the\r\nsubject [171].[3.3.39]\r\n\r\n=Rajas of Banera and Shāhpura.=—We have also, amongst the nobility of\r\nMewar, two who hold the independent title of prince or raja, one of whom\r\nis by far too powerful for a subject. These are the Rajas of Banera and\r\nShahpura, both of the blood royal. The ancestor of the first was the\r\ntwin-brother of Rana Jai Singh; the other, a Ranawat, branched off from\r\nRana Udai Singh.\r\n\r\nThey have their grants renewed, and receive the khilat of investiture;\r\nbut they pay no relief, and are exempt from all but personal attendance\r\nat their prince’s court, and the local service of the district in which\r\ntheir estates are situated. They have hitherto paid but little attention\r\nto their duties, but this defect arose out of the times. These lands\r\nlying most exposed to the imperial headquarters at Ajmer, they were\r\ncompelled to bend to circumstances, and the kings were glad to confer\r\nrank and honour on such near relations of the Rana’s house. He bestowed\r\non them the titles of Raja, and added to the Shahpura chief’s patrimony\r\na large estate in Ajmer, which he now holds direct of the British\r\nGovernment, on payment of an annual tribute.\r\n\r\n=Form and Substance of Grant.=—To give a proper idea of the variety of\r\nitems forming these chartularies, I append several[3.3.40] which exhibit\r\nthe rights, privileges, and honours, as well as the sources of income,\r\nwhile they also record the terms on which they are granted. Many\r\nroyalties have been alienated in modern times by the thoughtless\r\nprodigality of the princes; even the grand mark of vassalage, the fine\r\nof relief, has been forgiven to one or two individuals; portions of\r\ntransit duties, tolls on ferries, and other seignorial rights; coining\r\ncopper currency; exactions of every kind, from the levy of toll for\r\nnight protection of merchandise and for the repairs of fortifications,\r\nto the share of the depredations of the common robber, will sufficiently\r\nshow the demoralization of the country.\r\n\r\n=Division of Pattas, or Sub-infeudation.=—Many years ago, when the\r\nsimilarity of the systems first struck my attention, I took one of the\r\ngrants or _pattas_ of a great vassal of Jaipur, and dissected it in all\r\nits minutiae, with the aid of a very competent authority who had resided\r\nas one of the managers of the chief. This document, in which the\r\nsubdivision of the whole clan is detailed, materially aided me in\r\ndeveloping the system [172].\r\n\r\nThe court and the household economy of a great chieftain is a miniature\r\nrepresentation of the sovereign’s: the same officers, from the pardhan,\r\nor minister, to the cup-bearer (_paniyari_), as well as the same\r\ndomestic arrangements. He must have his _shish-mahall_,[3.3.41] his\r\n_bari-mahall_,[3.3.42] and his _mandir_,[3.3.43] like his prince. He\r\nenters the _dari-sala_, or carpet hall, the minstrel[3.3.44] preceding\r\nhim rehearsing the praises of his family; and he takes his seat on his\r\nthrone, while the assembled retainers, marshalled in lines on the right\r\nand left, simultaneously exclaim, “Health to our chief!” which\r\nsalutation he returns by bowing to all as he passes them. When he is\r\nseated, at a given signal they all follow the example, and shield\r\nrattles against shield as they wedge into their places.\r\n\r\nWe have neither the kiss nor individual oaths of fidelity administered.\r\nIt is sufficient, when a chief succeeds to his patrimony, that his\r\n‘_an_’[3.3.45] is proclaimed within his _sim_ or boundary. Allegiance is\r\nas hereditary as the land: “I am your child; my head and sword are\r\nyours, my service is at your command.” It is a rare thing for a Rajput\r\nto betray his Thakur, while the instances of self-devotion for him are\r\ninnumerable: many will be seen interspersed in these papers. Base\r\ndesertion, to their honour be it said, is little known, and known only\r\nto be execrated. Fidelity to the chief, Swamidharma, is the climax of\r\nall the virtues. The Rajput is taught from his infancy, in the song of\r\nthe bard, to regard it as the source of honour here, and of happiness\r\nhereafter. The poet Chand abounds with episodes on the duty and beauty\r\nof fidelity; nor does it require a very fervid imagination to picture\r\nthe affections which such a life is calculated to promote, when the\r\nchief is possessed of the qualities to call them forth. At the chase his\r\nvassals attend him: in the covert of the forest, the ground their social\r\nboard, they eat their repast together, from the venison or wild boar\r\nfurnished by the sport of the day; nor is the cup neglected. They are\r\nfamiliarly admitted at all times to his presence, and accompany him to\r\nthe court of their mutual sovereign. In short, they are\r\ninseparable.[3.3.46]\r\n\r\nTheir having retained so much of their ancient manners and customs,\r\nduring [173] centuries of misery and oppression, is the best evidence\r\nthat those customs were riveted to their very souls. The Rajput of\r\ncharacter is a being of the most acute sensibility; where honour is\r\nconcerned, the most trivial omission is often ignorantly construed into\r\nan affront.\r\n\r\n=Provision for Chief’s Relations.=—In all the large estates the chief\r\nmust provide for his sons or brothers, according to his means and the\r\nnumber of immediate descendants. In an estate of sixty to eighty\r\nthousand rupees of annual rent, the second brother might have a village\r\nof three to five thousand of rent. This is his patrimony (_bapota_): he\r\nbesides pushes his fortune at the court of his sovereign or abroad.\r\nJuniors share in proportion. These again subdivide, and have their\r\nlittle circle of dependents. Each new family is known by the name of the\r\nfounder conjoined to that of his father and tribe: _Man Meghsinghgot\r\nSaktawat_; that is, ‘Man, family of Megh, tribe Saktawat.’ The\r\nsubdivisions descend to the lowest denomination.\r\n\r\n=Charsa.=—_Charsa_, a ‘hide of land,’ or about sufficient to furnish an\r\nequipped cavalier. It is a singular coincidence that the term for the\r\nlowest subdivision of land for military service should be the same\r\namongst the Rajputs as in the English system. Besides being similar in\r\nname, it nearly corresponds in actual quantity. From the beginning of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon government the land was divided into hides, each\r\ncomprehending what could be cultivated by a single plough.[3.3.47] Four\r\nhides constituted one knight’s fee,[3.3.48] which is stated to be about\r\nforty acres. The Charsa may have from twenty-five to thirty bighas;\r\nwhich are equal to about ten acres—the Saxon hide.\r\n\r\nFor what these minor vassals held to be their rights on the great\r\npattawats, the reader is again referred to the letter of protest of the\r\ninferior pattawats of the Deogarh estate—it may aid his judgement; and\r\nit is curious to observe how nearly the subject of their prayer to the\r\nsovereign corresponded with the edict of Conrad of Italy,[3.3.49] in the\r\nyear 1037, which originated in disagreements between the great lords and\r\ntheir vassals on the subject of sub-infeudations [174].\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the subdivision before mentioned is carried in some\r\nof the Rajput States, is ruinous to the protection and general welfare\r\nof the country. It is pursued in some parts till there is actually\r\nnothing left sufficiently large to share, or to furnish subsistence for\r\none individual: consequently a great deprivation of services to the\r\nState ensues. But this does not prevail so much in the larger\r\nprincipalities as in the isolated tributary Thakurats or lordships\r\nscattered over the country; as amongst the Jarejas of Cutch, the tribes\r\nin Kathiawar, and the small independencies of Gujarat bordering on the\r\ngreater western Rajput States. This error in policy requires to be\r\nchecked by supreme authority, as it was in England by Magna\r\nCharta,[3.3.50] when the barons of those days took such precautions to\r\nsecure their own seignorial rights.\r\n\r\n=Brotherhood.=—The system in these countries of minute subdivision of\r\nfiefs is termed _bhayyad_,[3.3.51] or brotherhood, synonymous to the\r\ntenure by frerage of France, but styled only an approximation to\r\nsub-infeudation.[3.3.52] \"Give me my _bat_ (share),\" says the Rajput,\r\nwhen he attains to man’s estate, ‘the bat of the bhayyad,’ the portion\r\nof the frerage; and thus they go on clipping and paring till all are\r\nimpoverished. The ‘customs’ of France[3.3.53] preserved the dignities of\r\nfamilies and the indivisibility of a feudal homage, without exposing the\r\nyounger sons of a gentleman to beggary and dependence. It would be a\r\ngreat national benefit if some means could be found to limit this\r\nsubdivision, but it is an evil difficult of remedy. The divisibility of\r\nthe Cutch and Kathiawar frerage, carried to the most destructive extent,\r\nis productive of litigation, crime, and misery. Where it has proper\r\nlimits it is useful; but though the idea of each rood supporting its man\r\nis very poetical, it does not and cannot answer in practice. Its limit\r\nin Mewar we would not undertake to assert, but the vassals are careful\r\nnot to let it become too small; they send the extra numbers to seek\r\ntheir fortunes abroad. In this custom, and the difficulty of finding\r\n_daejas_, or dowers, for their daughters, we have the two chief causes\r\nof infanticide amongst the Rajputs, which horrible practice was not\r\nalways confined to the female.\r\n\r\nThe author of the Middle Ages exemplifies ingeniously the advantages of\r\nsub-[175]infeudation, by the instance of two persons holding one\r\nknight’s fee; and as the lord was entitled to the service of one for\r\nforty days, he could commute it for the joint service of the two for\r\ntwenty days each. He even erects as a maxim on it, that “whatever\r\nopposition was made to the rights of sub-infeudation or frerage, would\r\nindicate decay in the military character, the living principle of feudal\r\ntenure”;[3.3.54] which remark may be just where proper limitation\r\nexists, before it reaches that extent when the impoverished vassal would\r\ndescend to mend his shoes instead of his shield. Primogeniture is the\r\ncorner-stone of feudality, but this unrestricted sub-infeudation would\r\nsoon destroy it.[3.3.55] It is strong in these States; its rights were\r\nfirst introduced by the Normans from Scandinavia. But more will appear\r\non this subject and its technicalities, in the personal narrative of the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.3.1:\r\n\r\n  “Plusieurs possesseurs de fiefs, ayant voulu en laisser\r\n  perpétuellement la propriété à leurs descendans, prirent des\r\n  arrangemens avec leur Seigneur; et, outre ce qu’ils donnèrent pour\r\n  faire le marché, ils s’engagèrent, eux et leur postérité, à abandonner\r\n  pendant une année, au Seigneur, la jouissance entière du fief, chaque\r\n  fois que le dit fief changerait de main. C’est ce qui forma le droit\r\n  de _relief_. Quand un gentilhomme avait dérogé, il pouvait effacer\r\n  cette tache moyennant finances, et ce qu’il payait s’appelait\r\n  _relief_, il recevait pour quittance des lettres de _relief_ ou de\r\n  réhabilitation” (Art. ‘Relief,’ _Dict. de l’anc. Régime_).\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.3.2:\r\n\r\n  Namely, “the heir or heirs of an earl, for an entire earldom, one\r\n  hundred pounds; the heir or heirs of a baron, for an entire barony,\r\n  one hundred marks; the heir or heirs of a knight, for a whole knight’s\r\n  fee, one hundred shillings at most” (Art. III. Magna Charta).\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.3.3:\r\n\r\n  “Le droit de rachat devoit se payer à chaque mutation d’héritier, et\r\n  se paya même d’abord en ligne directe.—La coutume la plus générale\r\n  l’avait fixé à une année du revenue” (_L’Esprit des Loix_, livre xxxi.\r\n  chap. xxxiii.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.3.4:\r\n\r\n  That symbolic species of investiture denominated ‘improper\r\n  investiture,’ the delivery of a turf, stone, and wand, has its\r\n  analogies amongst the mountaineers of the Aravalli. The old baron of\r\n  Badnor, when the Mer villages were reduced, was clamorous about his\r\n  feudal rights over those wild people. It was but the point of honour.\r\n  From one he had a hare, from another a bullock, and so low as a pair\r\n  of sticks which they use on the festivals of the Holi. These marks of\r\n  vassalage come under the head of ‘petite serjanteri’ (petit\r\n  serjeantry) in the feudal system of Europe (see Art. XLI. of Magna\r\n  Charta).\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.3.5:\r\n\r\n  [\"All Rājput Jāgīrdārs, or holders of assigned lands, pay _nazarāna_\r\n  on the accession of a new Mahārāna, and on certain other occasions,\r\n  while most of them pay a fine called _Kaid_ [‘imprisonment’] on\r\n  succeeding to these estates.

It passed to all the children equally; in failure of\r\n  children, to the nearest kindred.” Thus it is strictly the _Miras_ or\r\n  _Bhum_ of the Rajputs: inheritance, patrimony. In Mewar it is\r\n  divisible to a certain extent; but in Cutch, to infinity: and is\r\n  liable only to local defence. The holder of bham calls it his\r\n  _Adyapi_, _i.e._ of old, by prescriptive right; not by written deed.\r\n  Montesquieu, describing the conversion of allodial estates into fiefs,\r\n  says, “These lands were held by Romans or Franks (_i.e._ freemen) not\r\n  the king’s vassals,” viz. lands exterior and anterior to the monarchy.\r\n  We have Rathor, Solanki, and other tribes, now holding bhum in various\r\n  districts, whose ancestors were conquered by the Sesodias, but left in\r\n  possession of small portions insufficient to cause jealousy. Some of\r\n  these may be said to have converted their lands into fiefs, as the\r\n  Chauhan lord of ——, who served the Salumbar chief.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.3.36:\r\n\r\n  Amidst ruins overgrown with forest, I discovered on two tables of\r\n  stone the genealogical history of this branch, which was of\r\n  considerable use in elucidating that of Anhilwara, and which\r\n  corresponded so well with the genealogies of a decayed bard of the\r\n  family, who travelled the country for a subsistence, that I feel\r\n  assured they formerly made good use of these marble records.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.3.37:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix, Nos.

In\r\n  each situation I have had my tents filled with them; and it was one of\r\n  the greatest pleasures I ever experienced, after I had taken my leave\r\n  of them, perhaps for ever, crossed the frontiers of Mewar, and\r\n  encamped in the dreary pass between it and Marwar, to find that a body\r\n  of them had been my guards during the night. This is one of the many\r\n  pleasing recollections of the past. Fortunately for our happiness, the\r\n  mind admits their preponderance over opposite feelings.

It is here called _rakhwali_,[3.4.1] or ‘preservation’; the\r\n_salvamenta_ of Europe.[3.4.2] To a certain degree it always existed in\r\nthese States; but the interminable predatory warfare of the last half\r\ncentury increased it to so frightful an extent that superior authority\r\nwas required to redeem the abuses it had occasioned. It originated in\r\nthe necessity of protection; and the modes of obtaining it, as well as\r\nthe compensation [176] when obtained, were various. It often consisted\r\nof money or kind on the reaping of each harvest: sometimes in a\r\nmultiplicity of petty privileges and advantages, but the chief object\r\nwas to obtain _bhum_: and here we have one solution of the constituted\r\n_bhumia_,[3.4.3] assimilating, as observed, to the allodial proprietor.\r\nBhum thus obtained is irrevocable; and in the eager anxiety for its\r\nacquisition we have another decided proof of every other kind of tenure\r\nbeing deemed resumable by the crown.\r\n\r\nIt was not unfrequent that application for protection was made to the\r\nnearest chief by the tenants of the fisc; a course eventually sanctioned\r\nby the Government, which could not refuse assent where it could not\r\nprotect. Here, then, we revert to first principles; and ‘seignorial\r\nrights’ may be forfeited, when they cease to yield that which ought to\r\nhave originated them, viz. benefit to the community. Personal service at\r\nstated periods, to aid in the agricultural[3.4.4] economy of the\r\nprotector, was sometimes stipulated, when the husbandmen were to find\r\nimplements and cattle,[3.4.5] and to attend whenever ordered. The\r\nprotected calls the chief ‘patron’; and the condition may not unaptly be\r\ncompared to that of personal commendation,[3.4.6] like _salvamenta_,\r\nfounded on the disturbed state of society. But what originated thus was\r\noften continued and multiplied by avarice, and the spirit of rapine,\r\nwhich disgraced the Rajput of the last half century, though he had\r\nabundance of apologies for ‘scouring the country.’ But all _salvamenta_\r\nand other marks of vassalage, obtained during these times of desolation,\r\nwere annulled in the settlement which took place between the Rana and\r\nhis chiefs, in A.D. 1818[3.4.7] [177].\r\n\r\nBut the crown itself, by some singular proceeding, possesses, or did\r\npossess, according to the _Patta Bahi_, or Book of Grants, considerable\r\n_salvamenta_ right, especially in the districts between the new and\r\nancient capitals, in sums of from twenty to one hundred rupees in\r\nseparate villages.\r\n\r\nTo such an extent has this _rakhwali_[3.4.8] been carried when\r\nprotection was desired, that whole communities have ventured their\r\nliberty, and become, if not slaves, yet nearly approaching the condition\r\nof slaves, to the protector. But no common visitation ever leads to an\r\nevil of this magnitude. I mention the fact merely to show that it does\r\nexist; and we may infer that the chief, who has become the arbiter of\r\nthe lives and fortunes of his followers, must have obtained this power\r\nby devoting all to their protection. The term thus originated, and\r\nprobably now (with many others) written for the first time in English\r\nletters in this sense, is _Basai_.\r\n\r\n=Basāi, Slavery.=—Slavery is to be found in successive stages of society\r\nof Europe, but we have no parallel in Rajwara (at least in name) to the\r\nagricultural serfs and _villains_ of Europe; nor is there any\r\nintermediate term denoting a species of slavery between the\r\n_Gola_[3.4.9] of the Hindu chief’s household and the free Rajput but the\r\nsingular one of _basai_, which must be explained, since it cannot be\r\ntranslated. This class approximates closely to the _tributarii_ and\r\n_coloni_, perhaps to the _servi_, of the Salic Franks, “who were\r\ncultivators of the earth, and subject to residence upon their master’s\r\nestate, though not destitute of property or civil rights.”[3.4.10]\r\nPrecisely the condition of the cultivator in Haraoti who now tills for a\r\ntaskmaster the fields he formerly owned, degraded to the name of\r\n_hali_,[3.4.11] a ploughman.\r\n\r\n“When small proprietors,” says Hallam, “lost their lands by mere rapine,\r\nwe may believe their liberty was hardly less endangered.” The _hali_ of\r\nHaraoti knows the bitter truth of this inference, which applies to the\r\nsubject immediately before us, [178] the _basai_. The portion of liberty\r\nthe latter has parted with, was not originally lost through compulsion\r\non the part of the protector, but from external violence, which made\r\nthis desperate remedy necessary. Very different from the _hali_ of\r\nKotah, who is servile though without the title—a serf in condition but\r\nwithout the patrimony; compelled to labour for subsistence on the land\r\nhe once owned; chained to it by the double tie of debt and strict\r\npolice; and if flight were practicable, the impossibility of bettering\r\nhis condition from the anarchy around would render it unavailing. This\r\nis not the practice under the patriarchal native government, which, with\r\nall its faults, retains the old links of society, with its redeeming\r\nsympathies; but springs from a _maire du palais_, who pursued an\r\nunfeeling and mistaken policy towards this class of society till of late\r\nyears. Mistaken ambition was the origin of the evil; he saw his error,\r\nand remedied it in time to prevent further mischief to the State. This\r\noctogenarian ruler, Zalim Singh of Kotah, is too much of a philosopher\r\nand politician to let passion overcome his interests and reputation; and\r\nwe owe to the greatest despot a State ever had the only regular charter\r\nwhich at present exists in Rajasthan, investing a corporate body with\r\nthe election of their own magistrates and the making of their own laws,\r\nsubject only to confirmation; with all the privileges which marked in\r\nthe outset the foundation of the free cities of Europe, and that of\r\nboroughs in England.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, in detached documents, we see the spirit of these\r\ninstitutions existing in Mewar, and it is as much a matter of\r\nspeculation, whether this wise ruler promulgated this novelty as a trap\r\nfor good opinions, or from policy and foresight alone: aware, when all\r\naround him was improving, from the shackles of restraint being cast\r\naside, that his retention of them must be hurtful to himself. Liberality\r\nin this exigence answered the previous purpose of extortion. His system,\r\neven then, was good by comparison; all around was rapine, save in the\r\nlittle oasis kept verdant by his skill, where he permitted no other\r\noppression than his own.\r\n\r\nThis charter is appended[3.4.12] as a curiosity in legislation, being\r\ngiven thirty years ago. Another, for the agriculturists’ protection, was\r\nset up in A.D. 1821. No human being prompted either; though the latter\r\nis modelled from the proceedings in Mewar, and may have been intended,\r\nas before observed, to entrap applause.\r\n\r\nIn every district of Haraoti the stone was raised to record this\r\nordinance [179].\r\n\r\n=Gola—Das= (_Slaves_).—Famine in these regions is the great cause of\r\nloss of liberty: thousands were sold in the last great famine. The\r\npredatory system of the Pindaris and mountain tribes aided to keep it\r\nup. Here, as amongst the Franks, freedom is derived through the mother.\r\nThe offspring of a _goli_[3.4.13] or _dasi_ must be a slave. Hence the\r\ngreat number of golas in Rajput families, whose illegitimate offspring\r\nare still adorned in Mewar, as our Saxon slaves were of old, with a\r\nsilver ring round the left ankle, instead of the neck. They are well\r\ntreated, and are often amongst the best of the military\r\nretainers;[3.4.14] but are generally esteemed in proportion to the\r\nquality of the mother, whether Rajputni, Muslim, or of the degraded\r\ntribes: they hold confidential places about the chiefs of whose blood\r\nthey are. The great-grandfather of the late chief of Deogarh used to\r\nappear at court with three hundred _golas_[3.4.15] on horseback in his\r\ntrain, the sons of Rajputs, each with a gold ring round his ankle: men\r\nwhose lives were his own. This chief could then head two thousand\r\nretainers, his own vassals.[3.4.16]\r\n\r\n=Slavery due to Gambling.=—Tacitus[3.4.17] describes the baneful effects\r\nof gambling amongst the German tribes, as involving personal liberty;\r\ntheir becoming slaves, and being subsequently sold by the winner. The\r\nRajput’s passion for gaming, as remarked in the history of the tribes,\r\nis strong; and we can revert to periods long anterior to Tacitus, and\r\nperhaps before the woods of Germany were peopled with the worshippers of\r\nTuisto, for the antiquity of this vice amongst the Rajput warriors,\r\npresenting a highly interesting picture of its pernicious effects.\r\nYudhishthira having staked and lost the throne of India to Duryodhana,\r\nto recover it hazarded the beautiful and virtuous Draupadi. By the\r\nloaded dice of his foes she became the _goli_ of the Kaurava, who,\r\ntriumphing in his pride, would have unveiled her in public; but the\r\ndeity presiding over female modesty preserved her from the rude gaze of\r\nthe assembled host; the miraculous scarf lengthened as he withdrew it,\r\ntill tired, he desisted at the instance of superior interposition.\r\nYudhishthira, not satisfied with this, staked twelve years of his\r\npersonal liberty, and became an exile from the haunts of Kalindi, a\r\nwanderer in the wilds skirting the distant ocean [180].\r\n\r\nThe illegitimate sons of the Rana are called _das_, literally ‘slave’:\r\nthey have no rank, though they are liberally provided for. _Basai_\r\nsignifies ‘acquired slavery’; in contradistinction to _gola_, ‘an\r\nhereditary slave.’ The gola can only marry a goli: the lowest Rajput\r\nwould refuse his daughter to a son of the Rana of this kind. The basai\r\ncan redeem[3.4.18] his liberty: the gola has no wish to do so, because\r\nhe could not improve his condition nor overcome his natural defects. To\r\nthe basai nothing dishonourable attaches: the class retain their\r\nemployments and caste, and are confined to no occupation, but it must be\r\nexercised with the chief’s sanction. Individuals reclaimed from\r\ncaptivity, in gratitude have given up their liberty: communities, when\r\nthis or greater evils threatened, have done the same for protection of\r\ntheir lives, religion, and honour. Instances exist of the population of\r\ntowns being in this situation. The greater part of the inhabitants of\r\nthe estate of Bijolli are the basai of its chief, who is of the Pramara\r\ntribe: they are his subjects; the Rana, the paramount lord, has no sort\r\nof authority over them. Twelve generations have elapsed since his\r\nancestor conducted this little colony into Mewar, and received the\r\nhighest honours and a large estate on the plateau of its border, in a\r\nmost interesting country.[3.4.19]\r\n\r\nThe only badge denoting the basai is a small tuft of hair on the crown\r\nof the head. The term interpreted has nothing harsh in it, meaning\r\n‘occupant, dweller, or settler.’ The numerous towns in India called\r\n_Basai_ have this origin: chiefs abandoning their ancient haunts, and\r\nsettling[3.4.20] with all their retainers and chattels in new abodes.\r\nFrom this, the town of Basai near Tonk (Rampura), derived its name, when\r\nthe Solanki prince was compelled to abandon his patrimonial lands in\r\nGujarat; his subjects of all classes accompanying him voluntarily, in\r\npreference to submitting to foreign rule. Probably the foundation of\r\nBijolli was similar; though only the name of Basai now attaches to the\r\ninhabitants. It is not uncommon [181], in the overflowing of gratitude,\r\nto be told, “You may sell me, I am your basai.”[3.4.21]\r\n\r\n=Private Feuds—Composition.=—In a state of society such as these\r\nsketches delineate, where all depends on the personal character of the\r\nsovereign, the field for the indulgence of the passions, and especially\r\nof that most incident to the uncontrollable habits of such\r\nraces—revenge—must necessarily be great. Private feuds have tended, with\r\nthe general distraction of the times, to desolate this country. Some\r\naccount of their mode of prosecution, and the incidents thence arising,\r\ncannot fail to throw additional light on the manners of society, which\r\nduring the last half-century were fast receding to a worse than\r\nsemi-barbarous condition, and, aided by other powerful causes, might\r\nhave ended in entire annihilation. The period was rapidly advancing,\r\nwhen this fair region of Mewar, the garden of Rajasthan, would have\r\nreverted to its primitive sterility. The tiger and the wild boar had\r\nalready become inmates of the capital, and the bats flitted undisturbed\r\nin the palaces of her princes. The ante-courts, where the chieftains and\r\ntheir followers assembled to grace their prince’s cavalcade, were\r\novergrown with dank shrubs and grass, through which a mere footpath\r\nconducted the ‘descendant of a hundred kings’ to the ruins of his\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nIn these principalities the influence of revenge is universal. Not to\r\nprosecute a feud is tantamount to an acknowledgement of\r\nself-degradation; and, as in all countries where the laws are\r\ninsufficient to control individual actions or redress injuries, they\r\nhave few scruples as to the mode of its gratification. Hence feuds are\r\nentailed with the estates from generation to generation. To sheathe the\r\nsword till ‘a feud is balanced’ (their own idiomatic expression), would\r\nbe a blot never to be effaced from the escutcheon.\r\n\r\nIn the Hindu word which designates a feud we have another of those\r\nstriking coincidences in terms to which allusion has already been made:\r\n_vair_ is ‘a feud,’ _vairi_, ‘a foe.’ The Saxon term for the composition\r\nof a feud, _wergild_, is familiar to every man. In some of these States\r\nthe initial vowel is hard, and [182] pronounced _bair_. In Rajasthan,\r\n_bair_ is more common than _vair_, but throughout the south-west _vair_\r\nonly is used. In these we have the original Saxon word _war_,[3.4.22]\r\nthe French _guer_. The Rajput _wergild_ is land or a daughter to wife.\r\nIn points of honour the Rajput is centuries in advance of our Saxon\r\nforefathers, who had a legislative remedy for every bodily injury, when\r\neach finger and toe had its price.[3.4.23] This might do very well when\r\nthe injury was committed on a hind, but the Rajput must have blood for\r\nblood. The monarch must be powerful who can compel acceptance of the\r\ncompensation, or _mund-kati_.[3.4.24]\r\n\r\nThe prosecution of a feud is only to be stopped by a process which is\r\nnext to impracticable; namely, by the party injured volunteering\r\nforgiveness, or the aggressor throwing himself as a suppliant unawares\r\non the clemency of his foe within his own domains: a most trying\r\nsituation for each to be placed in, yet not unexampled, and revenge in\r\nsuch a case would entail infamy. It was reserved for these degenerate\r\ndays to produce such an instance.\r\n\r\n=Amargarh-Shāhpura Feud.=—The Raja of Shahpura, one of the most powerful\r\nof the chiefs of Mewar, and of the Rana’s blood, had a feud with the\r\nRanawat chief, the Bhumia proprietor of Amargarh. Ummeda,[3.4.25] the\r\nchief of Shahpura, held two estates: one was the grant of the kings of\r\nDelhi, the other of his own sovereign, and each amounting to\r\n£10,000[3.4.26] of annual rent, besides the duties on commerce. His\r\nestate in Mewar was in the district of Mandalgarh, where also lay his\r\nantagonist’s; their bounds were in common and some of the lands were\r\nintermixed: this led to disputes, threats, and blows, even in the towns\r\nof their fathers, between their husbandmen. The Bhumia Dilel was much\r\nless powerful; he was lord of only ten villages, not yielding above\r\n£1200 a year; but they were compact and well managed, and he was [183]\r\npopular amongst his brethren, whose swords he could always command. His\r\ncastle was perched on a rock, and on the towers facing the west (the\r\ndirection of Shahpura) were mounted some swivels: moreover a belt of\r\nforest surrounded it, through which only two or three roads were cut, so\r\nthat surprise was impossible. Dilel had therefore little to fear, though\r\nhis antagonist could bring two thousand of his own followers against\r\nhim. The feud burned and cooled alternately; but the Raja’s exposed\r\nvillages enabled Dilel to revenge himself with much inferior means. He\r\ncarried off the cattle, and sometimes the opulent subjects, of his foe,\r\nto his donjon-keep in Amargarh for ransom. Meanwhile the husbandmen of\r\nboth suffered, and agriculture was neglected, till half the villages\r\nheld by Ummeda in Mandalgarh became deserted. The Raja had merited this\r\nby his arrogance and attempts to humble Dilel, who had deserved more of\r\nthe sympathies of his neighbours than his rival, whose tenants were\r\ntired of the payments of _barchi-dohai_.[3.4.27]\r\n\r\nUmmeda was eccentric, if the term be not too weak to characterize acts\r\nwhich, in more civilized regions, would have subjected him to coercion.\r\nHe has taken his son and suspended him by the cincture to the pinnacle\r\nof his little chapel at Shahpura, and then called on the mother to come\r\nand witness the sight. He would make excursions alone on horseback or on\r\na swift camel, and be missing for days. In one of these moods he and his\r\nfoe Dilel encountered face to face within the bounds of Amargarh. Dilel\r\nonly saw a chief high in rank at his mercy. With courtesy he saluted\r\nhim, invited him to his castle, entertained him, and pledged his health\r\nand forgiveness in the _munawwar piyala_:[3.4.28] they made merry, and\r\nin the cup agreed to extinguish the remembrance of the feud.\r\n\r\nBoth had been summoned to the court of the sovereign. The Raja proposed\r\nthat they should go together, and invited him to go by Shahpura. Dilel\r\naccordingly saddled his twenty steeds, moved out his equipage, and\r\nproviding himself with fitting raiment, and funds to maintain him at the\r\ncapital, accompanied the Raja to receive the return of his hospitality.\r\nThey ate from the same platter,[3.4.29] drank of the same cup and\r\nenjoyed the song and dance. They even went together to [184] their\r\ndevotions, to swear before their deity what they had pledged in the\r\ncup—oblivion of the past. But scarcely had they crossed the threshold of\r\nthe chapel, when the head of the chief of Amargarh was rolling on the\r\npavement, and the deity and the altar were sprinkled with his blood! To\r\nthis atrocious and unheard-of breach of the laws of hospitality, the\r\nRaja added the baseness of the pilferer, seizing on the effects of his\r\nnow lifeless foe. He is said, also, with all the barbarity and malignity\r\nof long-treasured revenge, to have kicked the head with his foot,\r\napostrophising it in the pitiful language of resentment. The son of\r\nDilel, armed for revenge, collected all his adherents, and confusion was\r\nagain commencing its reign. To prevent this, the Rana compelled\r\nrestitution of the horses and effects; and five villages from the estate\r\nof the Raja were the _mund-kati_ (wergild) or compensation to the son of\r\nDilel. The rest of the estate of the murderer was eventually\r\nsequestrated by the crown.\r\n\r\nThe feuds of Arja and Sheogarh are elsewhere detailed, and such\r\nstatements could be multiplied. Avowal of error and demand of\r\nforgiveness, with the offer of a daughter in marriage, often stop the\r\nprogress of a feud, and might answer better than appearing as a\r\nsuppliant, which requires great delicacy of contrivance.[3.4.30] Border\r\ndisputes[3.4.31] are most prolific in the production of feuds, and the\r\nRajput lord-marchers have them entailed on them as regularly as their\r\nestates. The border chiefs of Jaisalmer and Bikaner carry this to such\r\nextent that it often involved both states in hostilities. The _vair_ and\r\nits composition in Mandalgarh will, however, suffice for the present to\r\nexemplify these things.\r\n\r\n=Rajput Pardhans or Premiers.=—It would not be difficult, amongst the\r\n_Majores Domus Regiae_ of these principalities, to find parallels to the\r\n_Maires du Palais_ of France. Imbecility in the chief, whether in the\r\neast or west, must have the same consequences; and more than one State\r\nin India will present us with the joint appearance of the phantom and\r\nthe substance of royalty. The details of [185] personal attendance at\r\ncourt will be found elsewhere. When not absent on frontier duties, or by\r\npermission at their estates, the chiefs resided with their families at\r\nthe capital; but a succession of attendants was always secured, to keep\r\nup its splendour and perform personal service at the palace. In Mewar,\r\nthe privileges and exemptions of the higher class are such as to exhibit\r\nfew of the marks of vassalage observable at other courts. Here it is\r\nonly on occasion of particular festivals and solemnities that they ever\r\njoin the prince’s cavalcade, or attend at court. If full attendance is\r\nrequired, on the reception of ambassadors, or in discussing matters of\r\ngeneral policy, when they have a right to hear and advise as the\r\nhereditary council (_panchayat_) of the State, they are summoned by an\r\nofficer, with the prince’s _juhar_,[3.4.32] and his request. On grand\r\nfestivals the great _nakkaras_, or kettle-drums, beat at three stated\r\ntimes; the third is the signal for the chief to quit his abode and mount\r\nhis steed. Amidst all these privileges, when it were almost difficult to\r\ndistinguish between the prince and his great chiefs, there are occasions\r\nwell understood by both, which render the superiority of the former\r\napparent: one occurs in the formalities observed on a lapse; another,\r\nwhen at court in personal service, the chief once a week mounts guard at\r\nthe palace with his clan. On these occasions the vast distance between\r\nthem is seen. When the chief arrives in the grand court of the palace\r\nwith his retainers, he halts under the balcony till intimation is given\r\nto the prince, who from thence receives his obeisance and duty. This\r\nover, he retires to the great _darikhana_, or hall of audience,\r\nappropriated for these ceremonies, where carpets are spread for him and\r\nhis retainers. At meals the prince sends his compliments, requesting the\r\nchief’s attendance at the _rasora_[3.4.33] or ‘feasting hall,’ where\r\nwith other favoured chiefs he partakes of dinner with the prince. He\r\nsleeps in the hall of audience, and next morning with the same\r\nformalities takes his leave. Again, in the summons to the presence from\r\ntheir estates, instant obedience is requisite. But in this, attention to\r\ntheir rank is studiously shown by _ruqa_, written by the private\r\nsecretary, with the sign-manual of the prince attached, and sealed with\r\nthe private finger-ring. For the inferior grades, the usual seal of\r\nstate entrusted to the minister is used.\r\n\r\nBut these are general duties. In all these States some great court\r\nfavourite [186], from his talents, character, or intrigue, holds the\r\noffice of premier. His duties are proportioned to his wishes, or the\r\nextent of his talents and ambition; but he does not interfere with the\r\ncivil administration, which has its proper minister. They, however, act\r\ntogether. The Rajput premier is the military minister, with the\r\npolitical government of the fiefs; the civil minister is never of this\r\ncaste. Local customs have given various appellations to this officer. At\r\nUdaipur he is called _bhanjgarh_; at Jodhpur, _pardhan_; at Jaipur\r\n(where they have engrafted the term used at the court of Delhi)\r\n_musahib_; at Kotah, _kiladar_, and _diwan_ or regent. He becomes a most\r\nimportant personage, as dispenser of the favours of the sovereign.\r\nThrough him chiefly all requests are preferred, this being the surest\r\nchannel to success. His influence, necessarily, gives him unbounded\r\nauthority over the military classes, with unlimited power over the\r\ninferior officers of the State. With a powerful body of retainers always\r\nat his command, it is surprising we have not more frequently our ‘mayors\r\nof Burgundy and Dagoberts,’[3.4.34] our ‘Martels and Pepins,’ in\r\nRajasthan.\r\n\r\nWe have our hereditary Rajput premiers in several of these States: but\r\nin all the laws of succession are so regulated that they could not usurp\r\nthe throne of their prince, though they might his functions.\r\n\r\nWhen the treaty was formed between Mewar and the British Government, the\r\nambassadors wished to introduce an article of guarantee of the office of\r\npardhan to the family of the chief noble of the country, the Rawat of\r\nSalumbar. The fact was, as stated, that the dignity was hereditary in\r\nthis family; but though the acquisition was the result of an act of\r\nvirtue, it had tended much towards the ruin of the country, and to the\r\nsame cause are to be traced all its rebellions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SALUMBAR.\r\n  _To face page 216._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe ambassador was one of the elders of the same clan, being the grand\r\nuncle of the hereditary pardhan. He had taken a most active share in the\r\npolitical events of the last thirty years, and had often controlled the\r\ncouncils of his prince during this period, and actually held the post of\r\npremier himself when stipulating [187] for his minor relative. With the\r\nascendancy he exercised over the prince, it may be inferred that he had\r\nno intention of renouncing it during his lifetime; and as he was\r\neducating his adopted heir to all his notions of authority, and\r\ninitiating him in the intrigues of office, the guaranteed dignity in the\r\nhead of his family would have become a nonentity,[3.4.35] and the Ranas\r\nwould have been governed by the deputies of their mayors. From both\r\nthose evils the times have relieved the prince. The crimes of Ajit had\r\nmade his dismissal from office a point of justice, but imbecility and\r\nfolly will never be without ‘mayors.’\r\n\r\nWhen a Rana of Udaipur leaves the capital, the Salumbar chief is\r\ninvested with the government of the city and charge of the palace during\r\nhis absence. By his hands the sovereign is girt with the sword, and from\r\nhim he receives the mark of inauguration on his accession to the throne.\r\nHe leads, by right, the van in battle; and in case of the siege of the\r\ncapital, his post is the _surajpol_,[3.4.36] and the fortress which\r\ncrowns it, in which this family had a handsome palace, which is now\r\ngoing fast to decay.\r\n\r\nIt was the predecessor of the present chief of Salumbar who set up a\r\npretender and the standard of rebellion; but when foreign aid was\r\nbrought in, he returned to his allegiance and the defence of the\r\ncapital. Similar sentiments have often been awakened in patriotic\r\nbreasts, when roused by the interference of foreigners in their internal\r\ndisputes. The evil entailed on the State by these hereditary offices\r\nwill appear in its annals.\r\n\r\nIn Marwar the dignity is hereditary in the house of Awa; but the last\r\nbrave chief who held it became the victim of a revengeful and capricious\r\nsovereign,[3.4.37] [188] who was jealous of his exploits; and dying, he\r\nbequeathed a curse to his posterity who should again accept the office.\r\nIt was accordingly transferred to the next in dignity, the house of\r\nAsop. The present chief, wisely distrusting the prince whose reign has\r\nbeen a series of turmoils, has kept aloof from court. When the office\r\nwas jointly held by the chiefs of Nimaj and Pokaran, the tragic end of\r\nthe former afforded a fine specimen of the prowess and heroism of the\r\nRathor Rajput. In truth, these pardhans of Marwar have always been\r\nmill-stones round the necks of their princes; an evil interwoven in\r\ntheir system when the partition of estates took place amidst the sons of\r\nJodha in the infancy of this State. It was, no doubt, then deemed\r\npolitic to unite to the interests of the crown so powerful a branch,\r\nwhich when combined could always control the rest; but this gave too\r\nmuch equality.\r\n\r\n=The Chief of Pokaran.=—Deo Singh, the great-grandfather of the Pokaran\r\nchief alluded to, used to sleep in the great hall of the palace with\r\nfive hundred of his clan around him. “The throne of Marwar is in the\r\nsheath of my dagger,” was the repeated boast of this arrogant chieftain.\r\nIt may be anticipated that either he or his sovereign would die a\r\nviolent death. The lord of Pokaran was entrapped, and instant death\r\ncommanded; yet with the sword suspended over his head, his undaunted\r\nspirit was the same as when seated in the hall, and surrounded by his\r\nvassals. “Where, traitor, is now the sheath that holds the fortunes of\r\nMarwar?” said the prince. The taunt recoiled with bitterness when he\r\nloftily replied, “With my son at Pokaran I have left it.” No time was\r\ngiven for further insult; his head rolled at the steps of the palace;\r\nbut the dagger of Pokaran still haunts the imaginations of these\r\nprinces, and many attempts have been made to get possessed of their\r\nstronghold on the edge of the desert.[3.4.38] The narrow escape of the\r\npresent chief will be related hereafter, with the sacrifice of his\r\nfriend and coadjutor, the chief of Nimaj.\r\n\r\n=Premiers in Kotah and Jaisalmer.=—In Kotah and Jaisalmer the power of\r\nthe ministers is supreme. We might describe their situation in the words\r\nof Montesquieu. \"The Pepins kept their princes in a state of\r\nimprisonment in the palace, showing them once a year to the people. On\r\nthis occasion they made such ordinances as were directed [189] by the\r\nmayor; they also answered ambassadors, but the mayor framed the\r\nanswer.\"[3.4.39]\r\n\r\nLike those of the Merovingian race, these puppets of royalty in the east\r\nare brought forth to the Champ de Mars once a year, at the grand\r\nmilitary festival, the Dasahra. On this day, presents provided by the\r\nminister are distributed by the prince. Allowances for every branch of\r\nexpenditure are fixed, nor has the prince the power to exceed them. But\r\nat Kotah there is nothing parsimonious, though nothing superfluous. On\r\nthe festival of the birth of Krishna, and other similar feasts, the\r\nprince likewise appears abroad, attended by all the insignia of royalty.\r\nElephants with standards precede; lines of infantry and guns are drawn\r\nup; while a numerous cavalcade surrounds his person. The son of the\r\nminister sometimes condescends to accompany his prince on horseback; nor\r\nis there anything wanting to magnificence, but the power to control or\r\nalter any part of it. This failing, how humiliating to a proud mind,\r\nacquainted with the history of his ancestors and imbued with a portion\r\nof their spirit, to be thus muzzled, enchained, and rendered a mere\r\npageant of state! This chain would have been snapped, but that each link\r\nhas become adamantine from the ties this ruler has formed with the\r\nBritish Government. He has well merited our protection; though we never\r\ncontemplated to what extent the maintenance of these ties would involve\r\nour own character. But this subject is connected with the history of an\r\nindividual who yields to none of the many extraordinary men whom India\r\nhas produced, and who required but a larger theatre to have drawn the\r\nattention of the world. His character will be further elucidated in the\r\nAnnals of Haravati [190].\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.1:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix, Nos. VII., VIII., and IX.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.2:\r\n\r\n  This is the ‘_sauvement_ ou _vingtain_’ of the French system: there it\r\n  ceased with the cause. “Les guerres (feudal) cessèrent avec le régime\r\n  féodal, et les paysans n’eurent plus besoin de la protection du\r\n  Seigneur; on ne les força pas moins de réparer son château, et de lui\r\n  payer le droit qui se nommait de _sauvement_ ou _vingtain_” (Art.\r\n  ‘Château,’ _Dict. de l’Ancien Régime_).\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.3:\r\n\r\n  The chief might lose his _patta_ lands, and he would then dwindle down\r\n  into the _bhumia_ proprietor, which title only lawless force could\r\n  take from him. See Appendix, No. IX.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.4:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix, No. X., Art. II.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.5:\r\n\r\n  This species would come under the distinct term of Hydages due by\r\n  soccage vassals, who in return for protection supply carriages and\r\n  work (Hume, vol. ii. p. 308).\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.6:\r\n\r\n  Hallam, vol. i. p. 169.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.7:\r\n\r\n  In indulging my curiosity on this subject, I collected some hundred\r\n  engagements, and many of a most singular nature. We see the chieftain\r\n  stipulating for fees on marriages; for a dish of the good fare at the\r\n  wedding feast, which he transfers to a relation of his district if\r\n  unable to attend himself; portions of fuel and provender; and even\r\n  wherewithal to fill the wassail cup in his days of merriment. The\r\n  Rajput’s religious notions are not of so strict a character as to\r\n  prevent his even exacting his _rakhwali_ dues from the church lands,\r\n  and the threat of slaughtering the sacred flock of our Indian Apollo\r\n  has been resorted to, to compel payment when withheld. Nay, by the\r\n  chiefs it was imposed on things locomotive: on caravans, or Tandas of\r\n  merchandise, wherever they halted for the day, _rakhwali_ was\r\n  demanded. Each petty chief through whose district or patch of\r\n  territory they travelled, made a demand, till commerce was dreadfully\r\n  shackled; but it was the only way in which it could be secured. It was\r\n  astonishing how commerce was carried on at all; yet did the cloths of\r\n  Dacca and the shawls of Kashmir pass through all such restraints, and\r\n  were never more in request. Where there is demand no danger will deter\r\n  enterprise; and commerce flourished more when these predatory armies\r\n  were rolling like waves over the land, than during the succeeding\r\n  halcyon days of pacification.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.8:\r\n\r\n  The method by which the country is brought under this tax is as\r\n  follows: “When the people are almost ruined by continual robberies and\r\n  plunders, the leader of the band of thieves, or some friend of his,\r\n  proposes that, for a sum of money annually paid, he will keep a number\r\n  of men in arms to protect such a tract of ground, or as many parishes\r\n  as submit to the contribution. When the terms are agreed upon he\r\n  ceases to steal, and thereby the contributors are safe: if any one\r\n  refuse to pay, he is immediately plundered. To colour all this\r\n  villainy, those concerned in the robberies pay the tax with the rest;\r\n  and all the neighbourhood must comply or be undone. This is the case\r\n  (among others), with the whole low country of the shire of Ross”\r\n  (Extract from Lord Lovat’s Memorial to George I. on the State of the\r\n  Highlands of Scotland, in A.D. 1724).\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.9:\r\n\r\n  In Persian _ghulām_, literally ‘slave’; evidently a word of the same\r\n  origin with the Hindu _gola_.

He is mentioned\r\n  by the bard Chand in his exploits of Prithwiraja.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.16:\r\n\r\n  I have often received the most confidential messages, from chiefs of\r\n  the highest rank, through these channels. [There are, at the present\r\n  day, several bastard castes originally composed of the illegitimate\r\n  children of men of rank, Rājputs, Brāhmans, Mahājans, and others.\r\n  These are now recruited from the descendants of such persons, and from\r\n  recently born illegitimate children (_Census Report, Rajputana, 1911_,\r\n  i. 249f.).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.17:\r\n\r\n  _Germania_, xxiv.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.18:\r\n\r\n  The _das_ or ‘slave’ may hold a fief in Rajasthan, hut he never can\r\n  rise above the condition in which this defect of birth has placed him.\r\n  “L’affranchissement consistait à sortir de la classe des serfs, par\r\n  l’acquisition d’un fief, ou settlement d’un fonds. La nécessité où\r\n  s’étaient trouvés les seigneurs féodaux de vendre une partie de leurs\r\n  terres, pour faire leurs équipages des croisades, avait rendu ces\r\n  acquisitions communes; mais le fief n’anoblissait qu’à la troisième\r\n  génération.” Serfs who had twice or thrice been champions, or saved\r\n  the lives of their masters, were also liberated. “Un évêque d’Auxerre\r\n  déclara qu’il n’affranchirait gratuitement, qui que ce soit, s’il\r\n  n’avait reçu quinze blessures à son service” (see Article\r\n  ‘Affranchissement,’ _Dict. de l’ancien Régime_).\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.19:\r\n\r\n  I could but indistinctly learn whether this migration, and the species\r\n  of paternity here existing, arose from rescuing them from Tatar\r\n  invaders, or from the calamity of famine.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.20:\r\n\r\n  _Basna_, ‘to settle.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.21:\r\n\r\n  I had the happiness to be the means of releasing from captivity some\r\n  young chiefs, who had been languishing in Mahratta fetters as hostages\r\n  for the payment of a war contribution. One of them, a younger brother\r\n  of the Purawat division, had a mother dying to see him; but though he\r\n  might have taken her house in the way, a strong feeling of honour and\r\n  gratitude made him forgo this anxious visit: “I am your Rajput, your\r\n  gola, your basai.” He was soon sent off to his mother. Such little\r\n  acts, mingling with public duty, are a compensation for the many\r\n  drawbacks of solitude, gloom, and vexation, attending such situations.\r\n  They are no sinecures or beds of roses—ease, comfort, and health,\r\n  being all subordinate considerations.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.22:\r\n\r\n  Gilbert on _Tenures_, art. “Warranty,” p. 169. [Wergild, _wer_, ‘man,’\r\n  _gield_, _gieldan_; _vair_ is Skt. _vīra_, ‘hero’; O.E. _wer_, O.H.G.\r\n  _werran_, ‘to embroil,’ Fr. _guerre_.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.23:\r\n\r\n  “The great toe took rank as it should be, and held to double the sum\r\n  of the others, for which ten scyllinga was the value without the nail,\r\n  which was thirty scealta to boot” (Turner’s _Anglo-Saxons_, vol. ii.\r\n  p. 133).\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.24:\r\n\r\n  Appendix, No. XVIII. The laws of composition were carried to a much\r\n  greater extent amongst the Hindu nations than even amongst those of\r\n  the Anglo-Saxons, who might have found in Manu all that was ever\r\n  written on the subject, from the killing of a Brahman by design to the\r\n  accidental murder of a dog. The Brahman is four times the value of the\r\n  soldier, eight of the merchant, and sixteen times of the Sudra. “If a\r\n  Brahman kill one of the soldier caste (without malice), a bull and one\r\n  thousand cows is the fine of expiation. If he slays a merchant, a bull\r\n  and one hundred cows is the fine. If a Sudra or lowest class, ten\r\n  white cows and a bull to the priest is the expiation” [_Laws_, xi. 127\r\n  ff.]. Manu legislated also for the protection of the brute creation,\r\n  and if the priest by chance kills a cat, a frog, a dog, a lizard, an\r\n  owl, or a crow, he must drink nothing but milk for three days and\r\n  nights, or walk four miles in the night.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.25:\r\n\r\n  _Ummeda_, ‘hope.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.26:\r\n\r\n  Together £20,000, equal to £100,000 of England, if the respective\r\n  value of the necessaries of life be considered.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.27:\r\n\r\n  _Barchi_ is ‘a lance.’ In these marauding days, when there was a\r\n  riever in every village, they sallied out to ‘run the country,’ either\r\n  to stop the passenger on the highway or the inhabitant of the city.\r\n  The lance at his breast, he would call out _dohai_, an invocation of\r\n  aid. During harvest time _barchi-dohai_ used to be exacted.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.28:\r\n\r\n  ‘Cup of invitation.’ [_Munawwar_, Pers. ‘bright, splendid.’]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.29:\r\n\r\n  This is a favourite expression, and a mode of indicating great\r\n  friendship: ‘to eat of the same platter (_thali_), and drink of the\r\n  same cup (_piyala_).’\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.30:\r\n\r\n  The Bundi feud with the Rana is still unappeased, since the\r\n  predecessor of the former slew the Rana’s father. It was an\r\n  indefensible act, and the Bundi prince was most desirous to terminate\r\n  it. He had no daughter to offer, and hinted a desire to accompany me\r\n  _incog._ and thus gain admission to the presence of the Rana. The\r\n  benevolence and generosity of this prince would have insured him\r\n  success; but it was a delicate matter, and I feared some exposure from\r\n  any arrogant hot-headed Rajput ere the scene could have been got up.\r\n  The Raja Bishan Singh of Bundi is since dead [in 1828]; a brave and\r\n  frank Rajput; he has left few worthier behind. His son [Rām Singh,\r\n  1821-89], yet a minor, promises well. The protective alliance, which\r\n  is to turn their swords into ploughshares, will prevent their becoming\r\n  foes; but they will remain sulky border-neighbours, to the fostering\r\n  of disputes and the disquiet of the merchant and cultivator.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.31:\r\n\r\n  Sim—Kankar.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.32:\r\n\r\n  A salutation, only sent by a superior to an inferior.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.33:\r\n\r\n  The kitchen is large enough for a fortress, and contains large eating\r\n  halls. Food for seven hundred of the prince’s court is daily dressed.\r\n  This is not for any of the personal servants of the prince, or female\r\n  establishments; all these are separate.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.34:\r\n\r\n  Dagobert commended his wife and son Clovis to the trust of Ega, with\r\n  whom she jointly held the care of the palace. On his death, with the\r\n  aid of more powerful lords, she chose another mayor. He confirmed\r\n  their grants for life. They made his situation hereditary; but which\r\n  could only have held good from the crowd of imbeciles who succeeded\r\n  Clovis, until the descendant of this mayor thrust out his children and\r\n  seized the crown. This change is a natural consequence of unfitness;\r\n  and if we go back to the genealogies (called sacred) of the Hindus, we\r\n  see there a succession of dynasties forced from their thrones by their\r\n  ministers. Seven examples are given in the various dynasties of the\r\n  race of Chandra. (See Genealogical Tables, No. II.) [The above is in\r\n  some ways inaccurate, but it is unnecessary to correct it, as it is\r\n  not connected with the question of premiers in Rājputāna: see _EB_,\r\n  xvii. 938.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.35:\r\n\r\n  So many sudden deaths had occurred in this family, that the branch in\r\n  question (Ajit Singh’s) were strongly suspected of ‘heaping these\r\n  mortal murders on their crown,’ to push their elders from their seats.\r\n  The father of Padma, the present chief, is said to have been taken off\r\n  by poison; and Pahar Singh, one generation anterior, returning\r\n  grievously wounded from the battle of Ujjain, in which the southrons\r\n  first swept Mewar, was not permitted to recover. The mother of the\r\n  present young chief of the Jhala tribe of the house of Gogunda, in the\r\n  west, was afraid to trust him from her sight. She is a woman of great\r\n  strength of mind and excellent character, but too indulgent to an only\r\n  son. He is a fine bold youth, and, though impatient of control, may be\r\n  managed. On horseback with his lance, in chase of the wild boar, a\r\n  more resolute cavalier could not be seen. His mother, when he left the\r\n  estate alone for court, which he seldom did without her accompanying\r\n  him, never failed to send me a long letter, beseeching me to guard the\r\n  welfare of her son. My house was his great resort: he delighted to\r\n  pull over my books, or go fishing or riding with me.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.36:\r\n\r\n  _Surya_, ‘sun’; and _pol_, ‘gate.’ _Poliya_, ‘a porter.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.37:\r\n\r\n  “The _cur_ can bite,” the reply of this chief, either personally, or\r\n  to the person who reported that his sovereign so designated him, was\r\n  never forgiven.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.38:\r\n\r\n  His son, Sabal Singh, followed in his footsteps, till an accidental\r\n  cannon-shot relieved the terrors of the prince.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.4.39:\r\n\r\n  _L’Esprit des Loix_, chap. vi. livre 31.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 5\r\n\r\n\r\n=Adoption.=—The hereditary principle, which perpetuates in these States\r\ntheir virtues and their vices, is also the grand preservative of their\r\npolitical existence and national manners: it is an imperishable\r\nprinciple, which resists time and innovation: it is this which made the\r\nlaws of the Medes and Persians, as well as those of the Rajputs,\r\nunalterable. A chief of Mewar, like his sovereign, never dies: he\r\ndisappears to be regenerated. ‘_Le roi est mort, vive le roi!_’ is a\r\nphrase, the precise virtue of which is there well understood. Neither\r\nthe crown nor the greater fiefs are ever without heirs. Adoption is the\r\npreservative of honours and titles; the great fiefs of Rajasthan can\r\nnever become extinct.[3.5.1] But, however valuable this privilege, which\r\nthe law of custom has made a right, it is often carried to the most\r\nhurtful and foolish extent. They have allowed the limit which defined it\r\nto be effaced, and each family, of course, maintains a custom, so\r\nsoothing to vanity, as the prospect of having their names revived in\r\ntheir descendants. This has resulted from the weakness of the prince and\r\nthe misery of the times. Lands were bestowed liberally which yielded\r\nnothing to their master, who, in securing a nominal obedience and\r\nservitude, had as much as the times made them worth when given; but with\r\nreturning prosperity and old customs, these great errors have become too\r\nvisible. Adoptions are often made during the life of the incumbent when\r\nwithout prospect of issue. The chief and his wife first agitate the\r\nsubject in private; it is then confided to the little council of the\r\nfief, and when propinquity and merit unite, they at once petition the\r\nprince to confirm their wishes, which are generally acceded to. So many\r\ninterests are to be consulted on this occasion, that the blind\r\npartiality of the chief to any particular object is always counterpoised\r\nby the elders of the clan, who must have a pride in seeing a proper\r\nThakur[3.5.2] at their head, and who prefer the nearest of kin, to\r\nprevent the disputes which would be attendant on neglect in this point\r\n[191].\r\n\r\nOn sudden lapses, the wife is allowed the privilege, in conjunction with\r\nthose interested in the fief, of nomination, though the case is seldom\r\nleft unprovided for: there is always a presumptive heir to the smallest\r\nsub-infeudation of these estates. The wife of the deceased is the\r\nguardian of the minority of the adopted.\r\n\r\n=The Case of Deogarh.=—The chief of Deogarh, one of the sixteen\r\nOmras[3.5.3] of Mewar, died without issue. On his death-bed he\r\nrecommended to his wife and chiefs Nahar Singh for their adoption. This\r\nwas the son of the independent chieftain of Sangramgarh, already\r\nmentioned. There were nearer kin, some of the seventh and eighth\r\ndegrees, and young Nahar was the eleventh. It was never contemplated\r\nthat the three last gigantic[3.5.4] chieftains of Deogarh would die\r\nwithout issue, or the branches, now claimants from propinquity, would\r\nhave been educated to suit the dignity; but being brought up remote from\r\ncourt, they had been compelled to seek employment where obtainable, or\r\nto live on the few acres to which their distant claim of birth\r\nrestricted them. Two of these, who had but the latter resource to fly\r\nto, had become mere boors; and of two who had sought service abroad by\r\narms, one was a cavalier in the retinue of the prince, and the other a\r\nhanger-on about court: both dissipated and unfitted, as the frerage\r\nasserted, ‘to be the chieftains of two thousand Rajputs, the sons of one\r\nfather.’[3.5.5] Much interest and intrigue were carried on for one of\r\nthese, and he was supported by the young prince and a faction. Some of\r\nthe senior Pattawats of Deogarh are men of the highest character, and\r\noften lamented the sombre qualities of their chief, which prevented the\r\nclan having that interest in the State to which its extent and rank\r\nentitled it. While these intrigues were in their infancy, they adopted a\r\ndecided measure; they brought home young Nahar from his father’s\r\nresidence, and ‘bound round his head the turban of the deceased.’ In his\r\nname the death of the late chief was announced. It was added, that he\r\nhoped to see his friends after the stated days of _matam_ or mourning;\r\nand he performed all the duties of the son of Deogarh, and lighted the\r\nfuneral pyre.\r\n\r\nWhen these proceedings were reported, the Rana was highly and justly\r\nincensed. The late chief had been one of the rebels of S. 1848;[3.5.6]\r\nand though pardon had been [192] granted, yet this revived all the\r\nrecollection of the past, and he felt inclined to extinguish the name of\r\nSangawat.[3.5.7]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the common sequestration, he sent an especial one with\r\ncommands to collect the produce of the harvest then reaping, charging\r\nthe sub-vassals with the design of overturning his lawful authority.\r\nThey replied very submissively, and artfully asserted that they had only\r\ngiven a son to Gokuldas, not an heir to Deogarh; that the sovereign\r\nalone could do this, and that they trusted to his nominating one who\r\nwould be an efficient leader of so many Rajputs in the service of the\r\nRana. They urged the pretensions of young Nahar, at the same time\r\nleaving the decision to the sovereign. Their judicious reply was well\r\nsupported by their ambassador at court, who was the bard of Deogarh, and\r\nhad recently become, though _ex officio_, physician to the\r\nprince.[3.5.8] The point was finally adjusted, and Nahar was brought to\r\ncourt, and invested with the sword by the hand of the sovereign, and he\r\nis now lord of Deogarh Madri, one of the richest and most powerful\r\nfiefs[3.5.9] of Mewar. Madri was the ancient name of the estate; and\r\nSangramgarh, of which Nahar was the heir, was severed from it, but by\r\nsome means had reverted to the crown, of which it now holds. The\r\nadoption of Nahar by Gokuldas leaves the paternal estate without an\r\nimmediate heir; and his actual father being mad, if more distant claims\r\nare not admitted, it is probable that Sangramgarh will eventually revert\r\nto the fisc.\r\n\r\n=Reflections.=—The system of feuds must have attained considerable\r\nmaturity amongst the Rajputs, to have left such traces, notwithstanding\r\nthe desolation that has swept the land: but without circumspection these\r\nfew remaining customs will become a dead letter. Unless we abstain from\r\nall internal interference, we must destroy the links which connect the\r\nprince and his vassals; and, in lieu of a system decidedly imperfect, we\r\nshould leave them none at all, or at least not a system of feuds, the\r\nonly one they can comprehend. Our friendship has rescued them from\r\nexterior foes, and time will restore the rest. With the dignity and\r\n[193] establishments of their chiefs, ancient usages will revive; and\r\n_nazarana_ (relief), _kharg bandhai_ (investiture), _dasaundh_ (aids or\r\nbenevolence, literally ‘the tenth’), and other incidents, will cease to\r\nbe mere ceremonies. The desire of every liberal mind, as well as the\r\nprofessed wish of the British Government, is to aid in their renovation,\r\nand this will be best effected by not meddling with what we but\r\nimperfectly understand.[3.5.10]\r\n\r\nWe have nothing to apprehend from the Rajput States if raised to their\r\nancient prosperity. The closest attention to their history proves beyond\r\ncontradiction that they were never capable of uniting, even for their\r\nown preservation: a breath, a scurrilous stanza of a bard, has severed\r\ntheir closest confederacies. No national head exists amongst them as\r\namongst the Mahrattas; and each chief being master of his own house and\r\nfollowers, they are individually too weak to cause us any alarm.\r\n\r\nNo feudal government can be dangerous as a neighbour; for defence it has\r\nin all countries been found defective; and for aggression, totally\r\ninefficient. Let there exist between us the most perfect understanding\r\nand identity of interests; the foundation-step to which is to lessen or\r\nremit the galling, and to us contemptible tribute, now exacted,\r\nenfranchise them from our espionage and agency, and either unlock them\r\naltogether from our dangerous embrace, or let the ties between us be\r\nsuch only as would ensure grand results: such as general commercial\r\nfreedom and protection, with treaties of friendly alliance. Then, if a\r\nTatar or a Russian invasion threatened our eastern empire, fifty\r\nthousand Rajputs would be no despicable allies.[3.5.11]\r\n\r\n=Rajput Loyalty and Patriotism.=—Let us call to mind what they did when\r\nthey fought for Aurangzeb: they are still unchanged, if we give them the\r\nproper stimulus. Gratitude, honour, and fidelity, are terms which at one\r\ntime were the foundation of all the virtues of a Rajput. Of the theory\r\nof these sentiments he is still enamoured; but, unfortunately, for his\r\nhappiness, the times have left him but little scope for the practice\r\n[194] of them. Ask a Rajput which is the greatest of crimes? he will\r\nreply, ‘_gunchhor_,’ ‘forgetfulness of favours.’ This is his most\r\npowerful term for ingratitude. Gratitude with him embraces every\r\nobligation of life, and is inseparable from _swamidharma_, ‘fidelity to\r\nhis lord.’ He who is wanting in these is not deemed fit to live, and is\r\ndoomed to eternal pains in Pluto’s[3.5.12] realm hereafter.[3.5.13]\r\n\r\n“It was a powerful feeling,” says an historian[3.5.14] who always\r\nidentifies his own emotions with his subject, “which could make the\r\nbravest of men put up with slights and ill-treatment at the hand of\r\ntheir sovereign, or call forth all the energies of discontented exertion\r\nfor one whom they never saw, and in whose character there was nothing to\r\nesteem. Loyalty has scarcely less tendency to refine and elevate the\r\nheart than patriotism itself.” That these sentiments were combined, the\r\npast history of the Rajputs will show;[3.5.15] and to the strength of\r\nthese ties do they owe their political existence, which has outlived\r\nages of strife. But for these, they would have been converts and vassals\r\nto the Tatars, who would still have been enthroned in Delhi. Neglect,\r\noppression, and religious interference, sunk one of the greatest\r\nmonarchies of the world;[3.5.16] made Sivaji a hero, and converted the\r\npeaceful husbandmen of the Kistna and Godavari into a brave but\r\nrapacious soldier.\r\n\r\nWe have abundant examples, and I trust need not exclaim with the wise\r\nminister of Akbar, “who so happy as to profit by them?”[3.5.17]\r\n\r\nThe Rajput, with all his turbulence, possesses in an eminent degree both\r\nloyalty and patriotism; and though he occasionally exhibits his\r\nrefractory spirit to his [195] father and sovereign,[3.5.18] we shall\r\nsee of what he is capable when his country is threatened with\r\ndismemberment, from the history of Mewar, and the reign of Ajit Singh of\r\nMarwar. In this last we have one of the noblest examples history can\r\nafford of unbounded devotion. A prince, whom not a dozen of his subjects\r\nhad ever seen, who had been concealed from the period of his birth\r\nthroughout a tedious minority to avoid the snares of a tyrant,[3.5.19]\r\nby the mere magic of a name kept the discordant materials of a great\r\nfeudal association in subjection, till, able to bear arms, he issued\r\nfrom his concealment to head these devoted adherents, and reconquer what\r\nthey had so long struggled to maintain. So glorious a contest, of twenty\r\nyears’ duration, requires but an historian to immortalize it.\r\nUnfortunately we have only the relation of isolated encounters, which,\r\nthough exhibiting a prodigality of blood and acts of high devotion, are\r\ndeficient in those minor details which give unity and interest to the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n=Gallant Services to the Empire.=—Let us take the Rajput character from\r\nthe royal historians themselves, from Akbar, Jahangir, Aurangzeb. The\r\nmost brilliant conquests of these monarchs were by their Rajput allies;\r\nthough the little regard the latter had for opinion alienated the\r\nsympathies of a race, who when rightly managed, encountered at command\r\nthe Afghan amidst the snows of Caucasus, or made the furthest Cheronese\r\ntributary to the empire. Assam, where the British arms were recently\r\nengaged, and for the issue of which such anxiety was manifested in the\r\nmetropolis of Britain, was conquered by a Rajput prince,[3.5.20] whose\r\ndescendant is now an ally of the British Government.\r\n\r\nBut Englishmen in the east, as elsewhere, undervalue everything not\r\nnational. They have been accustomed to conquest, not reverses: though it\r\nis only by studying the character of those around them that the latter\r\ncan be avoided and this superiority maintained. Superficial observers\r\nimagine that from lengthened predatory spoliation the energy of the\r\nRajput has fled: an idea which is at once erroneous and dangerous. The\r\nvices now manifest from oppression will disappear [196] with the cause,\r\nand with reviving prosperity new feelings will be generated, and each\r\nnational tie and custom be strengthened. The Rajput would glory in\r\nputting on his saffron robes[3.5.21] to fight for such a land, and for\r\nthose who disinterestedly laboured to benefit it.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, apply history to its proper use. We need not turn to\r\nancient Rome for illustration of the dangers inseparable from wide\r\ndominion and extensive alliances. The twenty-two Satrapies of India, the\r\ngreater part of which are now the appanage of Britain, exhibited, even a\r\ncentury ago, one of the most splendid monarchies history has made known,\r\ntoo extensive for the genius of any single individual effectually to\r\ncontrol. Yet was it held together, till encroachment on their rights,\r\nand disregard to their habits and religious opinions, alienated the\r\nRajputs, and excited the inhabitants of the south to rise against their\r\nMogul oppressors. ‘Then was the throne of Aurangzeb at the mercy of a\r\nBrahman, and the grandson[3.5.22] of a cultivator in the province of\r\nKhandesh held the descendants of Timur pensioners on his bounty’ [197].\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.5.1:\r\n\r\n  [The abandonment of the policy of escheat or lapse, and the\r\n  recognition of the right of adoption were announced by Lord Canning in\r\n  1859.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.5.2:\r\n\r\n  As in Deogarh.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.5.3:\r\n\r\n  [Umara, plural of Amīr, ‘a chief.’]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.5.4:\r\n\r\n  Gokuldas, the last chief, was one of the finest men I ever beheld in\r\n  feature and person. He was about six feet six, perfectly erect, and a\r\n  Hercules in bulk. His father at twenty was much larger, and must have\r\n  been nearly seven feet high. It is surprising how few of the chiefs of\r\n  this family died a natural death. It has produced some noble Rajputs.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.5.5:\r\n\r\n  _Ek bap ka beta._\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.5.6:\r\n\r\n  A.D. 1792.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.5.7:\r\n\r\n  That of the clan of Deogarh.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.5.8:\r\n\r\n  Apollo [Krishna] is the patron both of physicians and poets; and\r\n  though my friend Amra does not disgrace him in either calling, it was\r\n  his wit, rather than his medical degree, that maintained him at court.\r\n  He said it was not fitting that the sovereign of the world should be\r\n  served by clowns or opium-eaters; and that young Nahar, when educated\r\n  at court under the Rana’s example, would do credit to the country: and\r\n  what had full as much weight as any of the bard’s arguments was, that\r\n  the fine of relief on the _Talwar bandhai_ (or girding on of the\r\n  sword) of a lac of rupees, should be immediately forthcoming.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.5.9:\r\n\r\n  Patta. [About 30 miles south of Udaipur city.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.5.10:\r\n\r\n  Such interference, when inconsistent with past usage and the genius of\r\n  the people, will defeat the very best intentions. On the grounds of\r\n  policy and justice, it is alike incumbent on the British Government to\r\n  secure the maintenance of their present form of government, and not to\r\n  repair, but to advise the repairs of the fabric, and to let their own\r\n  artists alone be consulted. To employ ours would be like adding a\r\n  Corinthian capital to a column of Ellora, or replacing the mutilated\r\n  statue of Baldeva with a limb from the Hercules Farnese. To have a\r\n  chain of prosperous independent States on our only exposed frontier,\r\n  the north-west, attached to us from benefits, and the moral conviction\r\n  that we do not seek their overthrow, must be a desirable policy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.5.11:\r\n\r\n  [The author’s prediction has been realized by recent events.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.5.12:\r\n\r\n  _Yamaloka._\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.5.13:\r\n\r\n  The _gunchhor_ (ungrateful) and _satchhor_ (violator of his faith) are\r\n  consigned, by the authority of the bard, to sixty-thousand years’\r\n  residence in hell.

A more striking instance\r\n  could scarcely be given than in the recent civil distractions at\r\n  Kotah, where a mercenary army raised and maintained by the Regent,\r\n  either openly or covertly declared against him, as did the whole\r\n  feudal body to a man, the moment their young prince asserted his\r\n  subverted claims, and in the cause of their rightful lord abandoned\r\n  all consideration of self, their families and lands, and with their\r\n  followers offered their lives to redeem his rights or perish in the\r\n  attempt. No empty boast, as the conclusion testified. God forbid that\r\n  we should have more such examples of Rajput devotion to their sense of\r\n  fidelity to their lords!\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.5.16:\r\n\r\n  See statement of its revenues during the last emperor, who had\r\n  preserved the empire of Delhi united.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.5.17:\r\n\r\n  Abu-l Fazl uses this expression when moralizing on the fall of\r\n  Shihabu-d-din, king of Ghazni and first established monarch of\r\n  India, slain by Prithwiraja, the Hindu sovereign of Delhi [_Āīn_,\r\n  ii. 302]. [Muhammad Ghori, Shihābu-d-dīn, was murdered on the road\r\n  to Ghazni by a fanatic of the Mulāhidah sect, in March, A.D. 1206\r\n  (_Tabakāt-ī-Nāsiri_, in Elliot-Dowson ii. 297, 235). According to\r\n  the less probable account of Ferishta (Briggs, i. 185), he was\r\n  murdered at Rohtak by a gang of Gakkhars or rather Khokhars (Rose,\r\n  _Glossary_, ii. 275).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.5.18:\r\n\r\n  The Rajput, who possesses but an acre of land, has the proud feeling\r\n  of common origin with his sovereign, and in styling him _bapji_\r\n  (sire), he thinks of him as the common father or representative of the\r\n  race.

The Sarkar Company are sovereigns of Hindustan, and you know well\r\nall that regards our condition. Although there is nothing which respects\r\neither ourselves or our country hid from you, yet is there matter\r\nimmediately concerning us which it is necessary to make known.\r\n\r\nSri Maharaja and ourselves are of one stock, all Rathors. He is our\r\nhead, we his servants: but now anger has seized him, and we are\r\ndispossessed of our country. Of the estates, our patrimony and our\r\ndwelling, some have been made khalisa,[3.a.2] and those who endeavour to\r\nkeep aloof expect the same fate. Some under the most solemn pledge of\r\nsecurity have been inveigled and suffered death, and others imprisoned.\r\nMutasadis,[3.a.3] officers of state, men of the soil and those foreign\r\nto it, have been seized, and the most unheard-of deeds and cruelties\r\ninflicted, which we cannot even write. Such a spirit has possessed his\r\nmind as never was known to any former prince of Jodhpur. His forefathers\r\nhave reigned for generations; our forefathers were their ministers and\r\nadvisers, and whatever was performed was by the collective wisdom of the\r\ncouncil of our chiefs. Before the face of his ancestors, our own\r\nancestors have slain and been slain; and in performing services to the\r\nkings,[3.a.4] they made the State of Jodhpur what it is. Wherever Marwar\r\nwas concerned, there our fathers were to be found, and with their lives\r\npreserved the land. Sometimes our head was a minor; even then by the\r\nwisdom of our fathers and their services, the land was kept firm under\r\nour feet, and thus has it descended from generation to generation.\r\nBefore his eyes (Raja Man’s) we have performed good service: when at\r\nthat perilous time the host of Jaipur[3.a.5] surrounded [198] Jodhpur on\r\nthe field we attacked it; our lives and fortunes were at stake, and God\r\ngranted us success; the witness is God Almighty. Now, men of no\r\nconsideration are in our prince’s presence; hence this reverse. _When\r\nour services are acceptable, then is he our lord; when not, we are again\r\nhis brothers and kindred, claimants and laying claim to the land._\r\n\r\nHe desires to dispossess us; but can we let ourselves be dispossessed?\r\nThe English are masters of all India. The chief of —— sent his agent to\r\nAjmer; he was told to go to Delhi. Accordingly Thakur —— went there, but\r\nno path was pointed out. If the English chiefs will not hear us, who\r\nwill? The English allow no one’s lands to be usurped, and our birthplace\r\nis Marwar—from Marwar we must have bread. A hundred thousand\r\nRathors—where are they to go to? From respect to the English alone have\r\nwe been so long patient, and without acquainting your government of our\r\nintentions, you might afterwards find fault; therefore we make it known,\r\nand we thereby acquit ourselves to you. What we brought with us from\r\nMarwar we have consumed, and even what we could get on credit; and now,\r\nwhen want must make us perish, we are ready and can do anything.[3.a.6]\r\n\r\nThe English are our rulers, our masters. Sri Man Singh has seized our\r\nlands; by your government interposing these troubles may be settled, but\r\nwithout its guarantee and intervention we can have no confidence\r\nwhatever. Let us have a reply to our petition. We will wait it in\r\npatience; but if we get none, the fault will not be ours, having given\r\neverywhere notice. Hunger will compel man to find a remedy. For such a\r\nlength of time we have been silent from respect to your government\r\nalone: our own Sarkar is deaf to complaint. But to what extreme shall we\r\nwait? Let our hopes be attended to.

He respects not the privileges or customs established of old.\r\n\r\n2. To each Rajput’s house a charas[3.a.7] or hide of land was attached:\r\nthis he has resumed.\r\n\r\n3. Whoever bribes him is a true man: who does not, is a thief.\r\n\r\n4. Ten or twelve villages established by his pattayats[3.a.8] he has\r\nresumed, and left their families to starve.\r\n\r\n5. From time immemorial sanctuary (_saran_) has been esteemed sacred:\r\nthis he has abolished.\r\n\r\n6. On emergencies he would pledge his oath to his subjects (_ryots_),\r\nand afterwards plunder them.\r\n\r\n7. In old times, it was customary when the presence of his chiefs and\r\nkindred was required, to invite them by letter: a fine is now the\r\nwarrant of summons: thus lessening their dignity.\r\n\r\n8. Such messengers, in former times, had a taka[3.a.9] for their ration\r\n(_bhatta_); now he imposes two rupees [199].\r\n\r\n9. Formerly, when robberies occurred in the mountains within the limits\r\nof Deogarh, the loss was made good: now all complaint is useless, for\r\nhis faujdar[3.a.10] receives a fourth of all such plunder. The\r\nMers[3.a.11] range at liberty; but before they never committed murder:\r\nnow they slay as well as rob our kin; nor is there any redress, and such\r\nplunder is even sold within the town of Deogarh.\r\n\r\n10. Without crime, he resumes the lands of his vassals for the sake of\r\nimposition of fines; and after such are paid, he cuts down the green\r\ncrops, with which he feeds his horses.\r\n\r\n11. The cultivators[3.a.12] on the lands of the vassals he seizes by\r\nforce, extorts fines, or sells their cattle to pay them. Thus\r\ncultivation is ruined and the inhabitants leave the country.\r\n\r\n12. From oppression the town magistrates[3.a.13] of Deogarh have fled to\r\nRaepur. He lays in watch to seize and extort money from them.\r\n\r\n13. When he summons his vassals for purposes of extortion and they\r\nescape his clutches, he seizes on their wives and families. Females,\r\nfrom a sense of honour, have on such occasions thrown themselves into\r\nwells.\r\n\r\n14. He interferes to recover old debts, distraining the debtor of all he\r\nhas in the world: half he receives.\r\n\r\n15. If any one have a good horse, by fair means or foul he contrives to\r\nget it.\r\n\r\n16. _When Deogarh was established, at the same time were our allotments:\r\nas is his patrimony, so is our patrimony._[3.a.14] Thousands have been\r\nexpended in establishing and improving them, yet our rank, privileges,\r\nand rights he equally disregards.\r\n\r\n17. From these villages, founded by our forefathers, he, at will, takes\r\nfour or five skins of land and bestows them on foreigners; and thus the\r\nancient proprietors are reduced to poverty and ruin.\r\n\r\n18. From of old, all his Rajput kin had daily rations, or portions of\r\ngrain: for four years these rights have been abolished.\r\n\r\n19. From ancient times the pattayats formed his council; now he consults\r\nonly foreigners. What has been the consequence? the whole annual revenue\r\nderived from the mountains is lost.\r\n\r\n20. From the ancient Bhum[3.a.15] of the Frerage[3.a.16] the\r\nmountaineers carry off the cattle, and instead of redeeming them, this\r\nfaujdar sets the plunderers up to the trick of demanding\r\nrakhwali.[3.a.17]\r\n\r\n21. Money is justice, and there is none other: whoever has money may be\r\nheard. The bankers and merchants have gone abroad for protection, but he\r\nasks not where they are.\r\n\r\n22. When cattle are driven off to the hills, and we do ourselves justice\r\nand recover them, we are fined, and told that the mountaineers have his\r\npledge. Thus our dignity is lessened. Or if we seize one of these\r\nmarauders, a party is sent to liberate him, for which the faujdar [200]\r\nreceives a bribe. Then a feud ensues at the instigation of the liberated\r\nMer, and the unsupported Rajput is obliged to abandon his\r\npatrimony.[3.a.18] There is neither protection nor support. The chief is\r\nsupine, and so regardless of honour, that he tells us to take money to\r\nthe hills and redeem our property. Since this faujdar had power, ‘poison\r\nhas been our fate.’ Foreigners are all in all, and the home-bred are set\r\naside. Deccanis and plunderers enjoy the lands of his brethren. Without\r\nfault, the chiefs are deprived of their lands, to bring which into order\r\ntime and money have been lavished. Justice there is none.\r\n\r\nOur rights and privileges in his family are the same as his in the\r\nfamily of the Presence.[3.a.19] Since you[3.a.20] entered Mewar, lands\r\nlong lost have been recovered. What crimes have we committed that at\r\nthis day we should lose ours?\r\n\r\nWe are in great trouble.[3.a.21]\r\n\r\n                                No. III\r\n\r\nMaharaja Sri Gokuldas to the four ranks (_char misl_) of Pattayats of\r\nDeogarh, commanding. Peruse.\r\n\r\nWithout crime no vassal shall have his estate or charsas disseized.\r\nShould any individual commit an offence, it shall be judged by the _four\r\nranks_ (char misl), my brethren, and then punished. Without consulting\r\nthem on all occasions I shall never inflict punishment.[3.a.22] To this\r\nI swear by Sri Nathji. No departure from this agreement shall ever\r\noccur.

It will be\r\n  seen in the Annals, that to support this prince to the succession of\r\n  the Jaipur Gaddi, both Mewar and Jaipur were ruined, and the power of\r\n  the Deccanis established in both countries.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.36:\r\n\r\n  This is a proof of the value attached to bhum, when granted by the\r\n  inhabitants, as the first act of the new proprietor though holding the\r\n  whole town from the crown, was to obtain these few bighas as bhum.\r\n  After having been sixty years in that family, Amli has been resumed by\r\n  the crown: the bhum has remained with the chief.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.37:\r\n\r\n  This shows how bhum was extorted in these periods of turbulence, and\r\n  that this individual gift was as much to save them from the effects of\r\n  the Maharaja’s violence as to gain protection from that of others.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.38:\r\n\r\n  A seer on each maund of produce.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.39:\r\n\r\n  The labour of two ploughs (_hal_). _Halma_ is the personal service of\r\n  the husbandman with his plough for such time as is specified. _Halma_\r\n  is precisely the detested _corvée_ of the French régime. “Les\r\n  _corvées_ sont tout ouvrage ou service, soit de corps ou de charrois\r\n  et bêtes, pendant le jour, qui est dû à un seigneur. Il y avait deux\r\n  sortes de _corvées_: les réelles et les personnelles, etc. Quelquefois\r\n  le nombre des _corvées_ était fixe: mais, le plus souvent, elles\r\n  étaient à volonté du seigneur, et c’est ce qu’on appelait _corvées à\r\n  merci_” (Art. ‘Corvée,’ _Dict. de l’anc. Régime_). Almost all the\r\n  exactions for the last century in Mewar may come under this latter\r\n  denomination.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.40:\r\n\r\n  A great variety of oppressive imposts were levied by the chiefs during\r\n  these times of trouble, to the destruction of commerce and all\r\n  facility of travelling. Everything was subject to tax, and a long\r\n  train of vexatious dues exacted for “repairs of forts, boats at\r\n  ferries, night-guards, guards of passes,” and other appellations, all\r\n  having much in common with the ‘Droit de _Péage_’ in France. “Il n’y\r\n  avait pas de ponts, de gués, de chaussées, d’écluses, de défilés, de\r\n  portes, etc., où les féodaux ne fissent payer un droit à ceux que\r\n  leurs affaires ou leur commerce forçaient de voyager” (_Dict. de\r\n  l’anc. Régime_).\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.41:\r\n\r\n  The privileges of our Rajput chieftains on the marriages of their\r\n  vassals and cultivating subjects are confined to the best dishes of\r\n  the marriage feast or a pecuniary commutation. This is, however,\r\n  though in a minor degree, one of the vexatious claims of feudality of\r\n  the French system, known under the term _noçages_, where the seigneur\r\n  or his deputy presided, and had the right to be placed in front of the\r\n  bride, “et de chanter à la fin du répas, une chanson guillerette.” But\r\n  they even carried their insolence further, and \"poussèrent leur mépris\r\n  pour les villains (the agricultural classes of the Rajput system)\r\n  jusqu’à exiger que leurs chiens eussent _leur couvert_ auprès de la\r\n  mariée, et qu’on les laissât manger sur la table\" (Art. ‘Noçages,’\r\n  _Dict. de l’anc. Régime_).\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.42:\r\n\r\n  December.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.43:\r\n\r\n  The Raja of Kotah.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.44:\r\n\r\n  Commander of the forces and regent of Kotah.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.45:\r\n\r\n  Officers of the land revenue.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.46:\r\n\r\n  Land accountants.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.47:\r\n\r\n  The mercantile class.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.48:\r\n\r\n  Literally ‘good behaviour.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.49:\r\n\r\n  An agricultural tax.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.50:\r\n\r\n  Tax for registering.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.51:\r\n\r\n  This includes in one word the forced labour exacted from the working\r\n  classes: the _corvée_ of the French system.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.52:\r\n\r\n  Grain thrown on the inhabitants at an arbitrary rate; often resorted\r\n  to at Kotah, where the regent is farmer general.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.53:\r\n\r\n  Grain, the property of the government, thrown on the inhabitants for\r\n  purchase at an arbitrary valuation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.54:\r\n\r\n  The handful from each sheaf at harvest.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.55:\r\n\r\n  A day sacred to the Hindu, being that which divides the month.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.56:\r\n\r\n  Meaning, they shall not irrigate the fields.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.57:\r\n\r\n  This part of the edict is evidently the instigation of the Jains, to\r\n  prevent the destruction of life, though only that of insects.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.58:\r\n\r\n  The cause of this sumptuary edict was a benevolent motive, and to\r\n  prevent the expenses on these occasions falling too heavily on the\r\n  poorer classes. It was customary for the women to carry away under\r\n  their petticoats (_ghaghra_) sufficient sweetmeats for several days’\r\n  consumption. The great Jai Singh of Amber had an ordinance restricting\r\n  the number of guests to fifty-one on these occasions, and prohibited\r\n  to all but the four wealthy classes the use of sugar-candy: the others\r\n  were confined to the use of molasses and brown sugar. To the lower\r\n  vassals and the cultivators these feasts were limited to the coarser\r\n  fare; to juar flour, greens and oil. A dyer who on the Holi feasted\r\n  his friends with sweetmeats of fine sugar and scattered about balls\r\n  made of brown sugar, was fined five thousand rupees for setting so\r\n  pernicious an example. The _sadh_, or marriage present, from the\r\n  bridegroom to the bride’s father, was limited to fifty-one rupees. The\r\n  great sums previously paid on this score were preventives of\r\n  matrimony. Many other wholesome regulations of a much more important\r\n  kind, especially those for the suppression of infanticide, were\r\n  instituted by this prince.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.59:\r\n\r\n  ‘Defence against the cold weather’ (_si_). This in the ancient French\r\n  régime came under the denomination of “_Albergie_ ou Hébergement, un\r\n  droit royal. Par exemple, ce ne fut qu’après le règne de Saint Louis,\r\n  et moyennant finances, que les habitans de Paris et de Corbeil\r\n  s’affranchirent, les premiers de fournir au roi et à sa suite de bons\r\n  oreillers et d’excellens lits de plumes, tant qu’il séjournait dans\r\n  leur ville, et les seconds de le régaler quand il passait par leur\r\n  bourg.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.60:\r\n\r\n  The ‘Daurayat’ or runners, the term applied to the bands who swept the\r\n  country with their forays in those periods of general confusion, are\r\n  analogous to the armed bands of the Middle Ages, who in a similar\r\n  manner desolated Europe under the term _routiers_, tantamount to our\r\n  _rabars_ (on the road), the _labars_ of the Pindaris in India. The\r\n  Rajput Daurayat has as many epithets as the French _routier_, who were\r\n  called _escorcheurs_, _tard veneurs_ (of which class Gopaldas appears\r\n  to have been), _mille-diables_, _Guilleries_, etc. From the Crusades\r\n  to the sixteenth century, the nobles of Europe, of whom these bands\r\n  were composed (like our Rajputs), abandoned themselves to this sort of\r\n  life; who, to use the words of the historian, “préférèrent la vie\r\n  vagabonde à laquelle ils s’étoient accoutumés dans le camp, à\r\n  retourner cultiver leurs champs. C’est alors que se formèrent ces\r\n  bandes qu’on vit parcourir le royaume et étendre sur toutes les\r\n  provinces le fléau de leurs inclinations destructives, répandre\r\n  partout l’effroi, la misère, le deuil et le désespoir; mettre les\r\n  villes à contribution, piller et incendier les villages, égorger les\r\n  laboureurs, et se livrer à des accès de cruauté qui font frémir”\r\n  (_Dict. de l’ancien régime et des abus féodaux_, art. ‘Routier,’ p.\r\n  422).\r\n\r\n  We have this apology for the Rajput _routiers_, that the nobles of\r\n  Europe had not; they were driven to it by perpetual aggressions of\r\n  invaders. I invariably found that the reformed _routier_ was one of\r\n  the best subjects: it secured him from indolence, the parent of all\r\n  Rajput vices.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.61:\r\n\r\n  _Mund_, ‘the head’; _kati_, ‘cut.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.62:\r\n\r\n  [The double jasmine, _Jasminum sambac_.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.63:\r\n\r\n  The rebellion broke out during the reign of this prince.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.64:\r\n\r\n  Salvamenta.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.65:\r\n\r\n  Dues.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.66:\r\n\r\n  Transit duty.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.67:\r\n\r\n  Ditto.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3.a.68:\r\n\r\n  Different descriptions of thieves.

To him, the conqueror\r\nof Lanka,[4.1.1] the genealogists endeavour to trace the solar lines.\r\nThe titles of many of these claimants are disputed; but the Hindu tribes\r\nyield unanimous suffrage to the prince of Mewar as the legitimate heir\r\nto the throne of Rama, and style him Hindua Suraj, or ‘Sun of the\r\nHindus.’[4.1.2] He is universally allowed to be the first of the\r\n‘thirty-six royal tribes’; nor has a doubt ever been raised respecting\r\nhis purity of descent. Many of these tribes[4.1.3] have been swept away\r\nby time; and the genealogist, who abhors a vacuum in his mystic page,\r\nfills up their place with others, mere scions of some ancient but\r\nforgotten stem.\r\n\r\n=Stability of Mewār State.=—With the exception of Jaisalmer, Mewar is\r\nthe only dynasty of these races[4.1.3] which has outlived eight\r\ncenturies of foreign domination, in the same lands where [212] conquest\r\nplaced them. The Rana still possesses nearly the same extent of\r\nterritory which his ancestors held when the conqueror from Ghazni first\r\ncrossed the ‘blue waters’[4.1.4] of the Indus to invade India; while the\r\nother families now ruling in the northwest of Rajasthan are the relics\r\nof ancient dynasties driven from their pristine seats of power, or their\r\njunior branches, who have erected their own fortunes. This circumstance\r\nadds to the dignity of the Ranas, and is the cause of the general homage\r\nwhich they receive, notwithstanding the diminution of their power.\r\nThough we cannot give the princes of Mewar an ancestor in the Persian\r\nNushirwan, nor assert so confidently as Sir Thomas Roe his claims to\r\ndescent from the celebrated Porus,[4.1.5] the opponent of Alexander, we\r\ncan carry him into the regions of antiquity more remote than the\r\nPersian, and which would satisfy the most fastidious in respect to\r\nancestry.\r\n\r\n=Origin of the Rājputs.=—In every age and clime we observe the same\r\neager desire after distinguished pedigree, proceeding from a feeling\r\nwhich, though often derided, is extremely natural. The Rajaputras are,\r\nhowever, scarcely satisfied with discriminating their ancestors from the\r\nherd of mankind. Some plume themselves on a celestial origin, whilst\r\nothers are content to be demi-celestial; and those who cannot advance\r\nsuch lofty claims, rather than acknowledge the race to have originated\r\nin the ordinary course of nature, make their primeval parent of demoniac\r\nextraction; accordingly, several of the dynasties who cannot obtain a\r\nniche amongst the children of the sun or moon, or trace their descent\r\nfrom some royal saint, are satisfied to be considered the offspring of\r\nsome Titan (_Daitya_). These puerilities are of modern fabrication, in\r\ncases where family documents have been lost, or emigration has severed\r\nbranches from the parent stock; who, increasing in power, but ignorant\r\nof their birth, have had recourse to fable to supply the void. Various\r\nauthors, borrowing from the same source, have assigned the seat of Porus\r\nto the Rana’s family; and coincidence of name has been the cause of the\r\nfamily being alternately elevated and depressed. Thus the incidental\r\ncircumstance of the word Rhamnae being found in Ptolemy’s geography, in\r\ncountries bordering on Mewar, furnishes our ablest geographers[4.1.6]\r\nwith a reason [213] for planting the family there in the second century;\r\nwhile the commentators[4.1.7] on the geography of the Arabian travellers\r\nof the ninth and tenth centuries[4.1.8] discover sufficient evidence in\r\n“the kingdom of Rahmi, always at war with the Balhara sovereign,” to\r\nconsider him (notwithstanding Rahmi is expressly stated “not to be much\r\nconsidered for his birth or the antiquity of his kingdom”) as the prince\r\nof Chitor, celebrated in both these points.\r\n\r\nThe translator of the _Periplus of the Erythrean Sea_, following\r\nD’Anville,[4.1.9] makes Ozene (Ujjain) the capital of a Porus,[4.1.10]\r\nwho sent an embassy to Augustus to regulate their commercial\r\nintercourse, and whom he asserts to be the ancestor of the Rana. But to\r\nshow how guarded we should be in admitting verbal resemblance to decide\r\nsuch points, the title of Rana is of modern adoption, even so late as\r\nthe twelfth century; and was assumed in consequence of the victorious\r\nissue of a contest with the Parihara prince of Mandor, who bore the\r\ntitle of Rana, and who surrendered it with his life and capital to the\r\nprince of Mewar. The latter substituted it for the more ancient\r\nappellation of Rawal;[4.1.11] but it was not till the thirteenth century\r\nthat the novel distinction was generally recognized by neighbouring\r\npowers. Although we cannot for a moment admit the Rahmi, or even the\r\nRhamnae of Ozene, to be connected with this family, yet Ptolemy appears\r\nto have given the real ancestor in his Baleokouroi, the Balhara monarchs\r\nof the Arabian travellers, the Valabhiraes of Saurashtra, who were the\r\nancestors of the princes of Mewar.[4.1.12]\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed, it is necessary to specify the sources whence\r\nmaterials were obtained for the Annals of Mewar, and to give some idea\r\nof the character they merit as historical data [214].\r\n\r\n=Sources of the History.=—For many years previous to sojourning at the\r\ncourt of Udaipur, sketches were obtained of the genealogy of the family\r\nfrom the rolls of the bards. To these was added a chronological sketch,\r\ndrawn up under the eye of Raja Jai Singh of Amber, with comments of some\r\nvalue by him, and which served as a ground-work. Free access was also\r\ngranted to the Rana’s library, and permission obtained to make copies of\r\nsuch MSS. as related to his history. The most important of these was the\r\nKhuman Raesa,[4.1.13] which is evidently a modern work founded upon\r\nancient materials, tracing the genealogy to Rama, and halting at\r\nconspicuous beacons in this long line of crowned heads, particularly\r\nabout the period of the Muhammadan irruption in the tenth century, the\r\nsack of Chitor by Alau-d-din in the thirteenth century, and the wars of\r\nRana Partap with Akbar, during whose reign the work appears to have been\r\nrecast.\r\n\r\nThe next in importance were the Rajvilas, in the Vraj Bhakha, by Man\r\nKabeswara;[4.1.14] and the Rajratnakar,[4.1.15] by Sudasheo Bhat: both\r\nwritten in the reign of Rana Raj Singh, the opponent of Aurangzeb: also\r\nthe Jaivilas, written in the reign of Jai Singh, son of Raj Singh. They\r\nall commence with the genealogies of the family, introductory to the\r\nmilitary exploits of the princes whose names they bear.\r\n\r\nThe Mamadevi Prasistha is a copy of the inscriptions[4.1.16] in the\r\ntemple of ‘the Mother of the Gods’ at Kumbhalmer. Genealogical rolls of\r\nsome antiquity were obtained from the widow of an ancient family bard,\r\nwho had left neither children nor kindred to follow his profession.\r\nAnother roll was procured from a priest of the Jains residing in\r\nSandrai, in Marwar, whose ancestry had enjoyed from time immemorial the\r\ntitle of Guru, which they held at the period of the sack of Valabhipura\r\nin the fifth century, whence they emigrated simultaneously with the\r\nRana’s ancestors. Others were obtained from Jain priests at Jawad in\r\nMalwa. Historical documents possessed by several chiefs were readily\r\nfurnished, and extracts were made from works, both Sanskrit and Persian,\r\nwhich incidentally mention the family. To these were added traditions or\r\nbiographical anecdotes furnished in conversation by the Rana, or men of\r\nintellect amongst his chiefs [215], ministers, or bards, and\r\ninscriptions calculated to reconcile dates; in short, every\r\ncorroborating circumstance was treasured up which could be obtained by\r\nincessant research during sixteen years. The Commentaries of Babur and\r\nJahangir, the Institutes of Akbar, original grants, public and autograph\r\nletters of the emperors of Delhi and their ministers, were made to\r\ncontribute more or less; yet, numerous as are the authorities cited, the\r\nresult may afford but little gratification to the general reader, partly\r\nowing to the unpopularity of the subject, partly to the inartificial\r\nmode of treating it.\r\n\r\n=Kanaksen.=—At least ten genealogical lists, derived from the most\r\nopposite sources, agree in making Kanaksen the founder of this dynasty;\r\nand assign his emigration from the most northern of the provinces of\r\nIndia to the peninsula of Saurashtra in S. 201, or A.D. 145. We shall,\r\ntherefore, make this the point of outset; though it may be premised that\r\nJai Singh, the royal historian and astronomer of Amber, connects the\r\nline with Sumitra (the fifty-sixth descendant from the deified Rama),\r\nwho appears to have been the contemporary of Vikramaditya, B.C. 56.\r\n\r\nThe country of which Ayodhya (now Oudh) was the capital, and Rama\r\nmonarch, is termed, in the geographical writings of the Hindus, Kosala;\r\ndoubtless from the mother of Rama, whose name was Kausalya.[4.1.17] The\r\nfirst royal emigrant from the north is styled, in the Rana’s archives,\r\nKosala-putra, ‘son of Kosala.’\r\n\r\n=Titles of the Chiefs.=—Rama had two sons, Lava and Kusa: from the\r\nformer the Rana’s family claim descent. He is stated to have built\r\nLahore, the ancient Lohkot;[4.1.18] and the branch from which the\r\nprinces of Mewar are descended resided there until Kanaksen emigrated to\r\nDwarka. The difficulty of tracing these races through a long period of\r\nyears is greatly increased by the custom of changing the appellation of\r\nthe tribe, from conquest, locality, or personal celebrity. Sen[4.1.19]\r\nseems to have been the martial termination for many generations: this\r\nwas followed by Dit, or Aditya, a term for the ‘sun.’ The first change\r\nin the name of the tribe was on their expulsion from Saurashtra, when\r\nfor the generic term of Suryavansi was substituted the particular\r\nappellation of Guhilot. This name was maintained till another event\r\ndispersed the family, and when they settled in [216] Ahar,[4.1.20]\r\nAharya became the appellative of the branch. This continued till loss of\r\nterritory and new acquisitions once more transferred the dynasty to\r\nSesoda,[4.1.21] a temporary capital in the western mountains. The title\r\nof Ranawat, borne by all descendants of the blood royal since the\r\neventful change which removed the seat of government from Chitor to\r\nUdaipur, might in time have superseded that of Sesodia, if continued\r\nwarfare had not checked the increase of population; but the Guhilot\r\nbranch of the Suryavansi still retain the name of Sesodia.\r\n\r\nHaving premised thus much, we must retrograde to the darker ages,\r\nthrough which we shall endeavour to conduct this celebrated dynasty,\r\nthough the clue sometimes nearly escapes from our hands in these\r\nlabyrinths of antiquity.[4.1.22] When it is recollected to what violence\r\nthis family has been subjected during the last eight centuries, often\r\ndispossessed of all but their native hills and compelled to live on\r\ntheir spontaneous produce, we could scarcely expect that historical\r\nrecords should be preserved. Chitor was thrice sacked and destroyed, and\r\nthe existing records are formed from fragments, registers of births and\r\nmarriages, or from the oral relations of the bards.\r\n\r\n=Legend of Kanaksen.=—By what route Kanaksen, the first emigrant of the\r\nsolar race, found his way into Saurashtra from Lohkot, is uncertain: he,\r\nhowever, wrested dominion from a prince of the Pramara race, and founded\r\nBirnagara in the second century (A.D. 144). Four generations afterwards,\r\nVijayasen, whom the prince of Amber calls Nushirwan, founded Vijayapur,\r\nsupposed to be where Dholka now stands, at the head of the Saurashtra\r\npeninsula.[4.1.23] Vidarba was also founded by him, the name of which\r\nwas afterwards changed to Sihor. But the most celebrated was the\r\ncapital, Valabhipura, which for years baffled all search, till it was\r\nrevealed in its now humbled condition as Walai, ten miles west [217] of\r\nBhaunagar. The existence of this city was confirmed by a celebrated Jain\r\nwork, the Satrunjaya Mahatma.[4.1.24] The want of satisfactory proof of\r\nthe Rana’s emigration from thence was obviated by the most unexpected\r\ndiscovery of an inscription of the twelfth century, in a ruined temple\r\non the tableland forming the eastern boundary of the Rana’s present\r\nterritory, which appeals to the ‘walls of Valabhi’ for the truth of the\r\naction it records. And a work written to commemorate the reign of Rana\r\nRaj Singh opens with these words: “In the west is Sorathdes,[4.1.25] a\r\ncountry well known: the barbarians invaded it, and conquered\r\nBal-ka-nath;[4.1.26] all fell in the sack of Valabhipura, except the\r\ndaughter of the Pramara.” And the Sandrai roll thus commences: “When the\r\ncity of Valabhi was sacked, the inhabitants fled and founded Bali,\r\nSandrai, and Nadol in Mordar des.”[4.1.27] These are towns yet of\r\nconsequence, and in all the Jain religion is still maintained, which was\r\nthe chief worship of Valabhipura when sacked by the ‘barbarian.’ The\r\nrecords preserved by the Jains give S.B. 205 (A.D. 524) as the date of\r\nthis event.[4.1.28]\r\n\r\nThe tract about Valabhipura and northward is termed Bal, probably from\r\nthe tribe of Bala, which might have been the designation of the Rana’s\r\ntribe prior to that of Grahilot; and most probably Multan, and all these\r\nregions of the Kathi, Bala, etc., were dependent on Lohkot, whence\r\nemigrated Kanaksen; thus strengthening the surmise of the Scythic\r\ndescent of the Ranas, though now installed in the seat of Rama. The sun\r\nwas the deity of this northern tribe, as of the Rana’s ancestry, and the\r\nremains of numerous temples to this grand object of Scythic homage are\r\nstill to be found scattered over the peninsula; whence its name,\r\nSaurashtra, the country of the Sauras, or Sun-worshippers; the\r\nSurastrene or Syrastrene of ancient geographers; its inhabitants, the\r\n_Suros_ (Σύρων) of Strabo.[4.1.29]\r\n\r\nBesides these cities, the MSS. give Gayni[4.1.30] as the last refuge of\r\nthe family [218] when expelled Saurashtra. One of the poetic chronicles\r\nthus commences: “The barbarians had captured Gajni. The house of\r\nSiladitya was left desolate. In its defence his heroes fell; of his seed\r\nbut the name remained.”\r\n\r\n=Invaders of Saurāshtra.=—These invaders were Scythic, and in all\r\nprobability a colony from the Parthian kingdom, which was established in\r\nsovereignty on the Indus in the second century, having their capital at\r\nSaminagara, where the ancient Yadu ruled for ages: the Minnagara[4.1.31]\r\nof Arrian, and the Mankir of the Arabian geographers. It was by this\r\nroute, through the eastern portion of the valley of the Indus, that the\r\nvarious hordes of Getae or Jats, Huns, Kamari, Kathi, Makwahana, Bala\r\nand Aswaria, had peopled this peninsula, leaving traces still visible.\r\nThe period is also remarkable when these and other Scythic hordes were\r\nsimultaneously abandoning higher Asia for the cold regions of Europe and\r\nthe warm plains of Hindustan. From the first to the sixth century of the\r\nChristian era, various records exist of these irruptions from the north.\r\nGibbon, quoting De Guignes, mentions one in the second century, which\r\nfixed permanently in the Saurashtra peninsula; and the latter, from\r\noriginal authorities, describes another of the Getae or Jats, styled by\r\nthe Chinese Yueh-chi, in the north of India.[4.1.32] But the authority\r\ndirectly in point is that of Cosmas, surnamed Indikopleustes, who was in\r\nIndia during the reign of Justinian, and that of the first monarch of\r\nthe Chinese dynasty of Leam.[4.1.33] Cosmas [219] had visited Kalyan,\r\nincluded in the Balhara kingdom; and he mentions the Ephthalites, or\r\nWhite Huns, under their king Golas, as being established on the Indus at\r\nthe very period of the invasion of Valabhipura.[4.1.34]\r\n\r\nArrian, who resided in the second century at Barugaza (Broach),\r\ndescribes a Parthian sovereignty as extending from the Indus to the\r\nNerbudda.[4.1.35] Their capital has already been mentioned, Minnagara.\r\nWhether these, the Abtelites[4.1.36] of Cosmas, were the Parthian\r\ndynasty of Arrian, or whether the Parthians were supplanted by the Huns,\r\nwe must remain in ignorance, but to one or the other we must attribute\r\nthe sack of Valabhipura.\r\n\r\nThe legend of this event affords scope for speculation, both as regards\r\nthe conquerors and the conquered, and gives at least a colour of truth\r\nto the reputed Persian ancestry of the Rana: a subject which will be\r\ndistinctly considered. The solar orb, and its type, fire, were the chief\r\nobjects of adoration of Siladitya of Valabhipura. Whether to these was\r\nadded that of the lingam, the symbol of Balnath (the sun), the primary\r\nobject of worship with his descendants, may be doubted. It was certainly\r\nconfined to these, and the adoption of ‘strange gods’ by the Suryavansi\r\nGuhilot is comparatively of modern invention.[4.1.37]\r\n\r\n=The Fountain of the Sun.=—There was a fountain (_Suryakunda_) ‘sacred\r\nto the sun’ at Valabhipura, from which arose, at the summons of\r\nSiladitya (according to the legend) the seven-headed horse Saptasva,\r\nwhich draws the car of Surya, to bear him to battle. With such an\r\nauxiliary no foe could prevail; but a wicked minister revealed to the\r\nenemy the secret of annulling this aid, by polluting the sacred fountain\r\nwith blood. This accomplished, in vain did the prince call on Saptasva\r\nto save him from the strange and barbarous foe: the charm was broken,\r\nand with it sunk the dynasty of Valabhi. Who the ‘barbarian’ was that\r\ndefiled with blood of kine [220] the fountain of the sun,[4.1.38]\r\nwhether Getae, Parthian, or Hun, we are left to conjecture. The Persian,\r\nthough he venerated the bull, yet sacrificed him on the altar of\r\nMithras;[4.1.39] and though the ancient Guebre purifies with the\r\nurine[4.1.40] of the cow, he will not refuse to eat beef; and the\r\niniquity of Cambyses, who thrust his lance into the flank of the\r\nEgyptian Apis, is a proof that the bull was abstractedly no object of\r\nworship. It would be indulging a legitimate curiosity, could we by any\r\nmeans discover how these ‘strange’ tribes obtained a footing amongst the\r\nHindu races; for so late as seven centuries ago we find Getae, Huns,\r\nKathi, Ariaspas, Dahae, definitively settled, and enumerated amongst the\r\nChhattis rajkula. How much earlier the admission, no authority states;\r\nbut mention is made of several of them aiding in the defence of Chitor,\r\non the first appearance of the faith of Islam upwards of eleven hundred\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.1.1:\r\n\r\n  Said to be Ceylon; an idea scouted by the Hindus, who transfer Lanka\r\n  to a very distant region.

[This is not certain (Smith, _EHI_,\r\n  60, note).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.1.11:\r\n\r\n  _Rawal_, or _Raul_, is yet borne as a princely title by the Aharya\r\n  prince of Dungarpur, and the Yadu prince of Jaisalmer, whose ancestors\r\n  long ruled in the heart of Scythia. _Raoul_ seems to have been titular\r\n  to the Scandinavian chiefs of Scythic origin. The invader of Normandy\r\n  was _Raoul_, corrupted to _Rollon_ or _Rollo_.

[See p.\r\n  122 above.] [“Hippokoura, the royal seat of Baleo Kouros” (_Periplus_,\r\n  viii. 83).

Dict._\r\n  s.v.; _BG_, i. Part i. 6).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.1.30:\r\n\r\n  Gaini, or Gajni, is one of the ancient names of Cambay (the port of\r\n  Valabhipura), the ruins of which are about three miles from the modern\r\n  city. Other sources indicate that these princes held possessions in\r\n  the southern continent of India, as well as in the Saurashtra\r\n  peninsula. Talatalpur Patan, on the Godavari, is mentioned, which\r\n  tradition asserts to be the city of Deogir; but which, after many\r\n  years’ research, I discovered in Saurashtra, it being one of the\r\n  ancient names of Kandala. In after times, when succeeding dynasties\r\n  held the title of Balakarae, though the capital was removed inland to\r\n  Anhilwara Patan, they still held possession of the western shore, and\r\n  Cambay continued the chief port. [For the identification of Gajni with\r\n  Cambay see _IA_, iv. 147; _BG_, vi. 213 note. The site of Devagiri has\r\n  been identified with Daulatābād (_BG_, i. Part ii. 136; Beal,\r\n  _Buddhist Records of the Western World_, ii. 255, note).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.1.31:\r\n\r\n  The position of Minnagara has occupied the attention of geographers\r\n  from D’Anville to Pottinger. Sind being conquered by Omar, general of\r\n  the caliph Al-Mansur (Abbasi), the name of Minnagara was changed to\r\n  Mansura, “une ville célèbre sur le rivage droit du Sind ou Mehran.”\r\n  “Ptolémée fait aussi mention de cette ville; mais en la déplaçant,”\r\n  etc. D’Anville places it about 26°, but not so high as Ulug Bég, whose\r\n  tables make it 26° 40´. I have said elsewhere that I had little doubt\r\n  that Minnagara, handed down to us by the author of the _Periplus_ as\r\n  the μετρόπολις τῆς Σκυθίας, was the Saminagara of the Yadu Jarejas,\r\n  whose chronicles claim Seistān as their ancient possession, and in all\r\n  probability was the stronghold (_nagara_) of Sambos, the opponent of\r\n  Alexander. On every consideration, I am inclined to place it on the\r\n  site of Sehwan. The learned Vincent, in his translation of the\r\n  _Periplus_, enters fully and with great judgment upon this point,\r\n  citing every authority, Arrian, Ptolemy, Al-Biruni, Edrisi, D’Anville,\r\n  and De la Rochette. He has a note (26, p. 386, vol. i.) which is\r\n  conclusive, could he have applied it: “Al-Birun [equi-distant] between\r\n  Debeil and Mansura.” D’Anville also says: “de Mansora à la ville\r\n  nommée Birun, la distance est indiquée de quinze parasanges dans\r\n  Abulféda,” who fixes it, on the authority of Abu-Rehan (surnamed\r\n  Al-Biruni from his birthplace), at 26° 40´. The ancient name of\r\n  Haidarabad, the present capital of Sind, was Nerun (نيرون;) or Nirun,\r\n  and is almost equi-distant, as Abulfeda says, between Debal (Dewal or\r\n  Tatta) and Mansura, Sehwan, or Minnagara, the latitude of which,\r\n  according to my construction, is 26° 11´. Those who wish to pursue\r\n  this may examine the _Éclaircissemens sur la Carte de l’Inde_, p. 37\r\n  _et seq._, and Dr. Vincent’s estimable translation, p. 386. [The site\r\n  of Minnagara, like those of all the cities in the delta of the Indus,\r\n  owing to changes in the course of the river, is very uncertain.\r\n  Jhajhpur or Mungrapur has been suggested (McCrindle, _Ptolemy_, 72,\r\n  _Periplus_, 1086 f.). Nīrūn has been identified with Helāi, a little\r\n  below Jarak, on the high road from Tatta to Haidarābād (Elliot-Dowson\r\n  i. 400).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.1.32:\r\n\r\n  See _History of the Tribes_, p. 107, and translation of Inscription\r\n  No. I. _Vide_ Appendix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.1.33:\r\n\r\n  Considerable intercourse was carried on between the princes of India\r\n  and China from the earliest periods; but particularly during the\r\n  dynasties of Sum, Leam and Tam, from the fourth to the seventh\r\n  centuries, when the princes from Bengal and Malabar to the Panjab sent\r\n  embassies to the Chinese monarchs. The dominions of these Hindu\r\n  princes may yet be identified. [Cosmas flourished in the sixth century\r\n  A.D., and never reached India proper (_EB_, vii. 214).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.1.34:\r\n\r\n  [Gollas was Mihiragula (Smith, _EHI_, 317).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.1.35:\r\n\r\n  [_Ibid._ 230 f.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.1.36:\r\n\r\n  D’Herbelot (vol. i. p. 179) calls them the Haiathelah or Indoscythae,\r\n  and says that they were apparently from Thibet, between India and\r\n  China. De Guignes (tome i. p. 325) is offended with this explanation,\r\n  and says: “Cette conjecture ne peut avoir lieu, les Euthélites n’ayant\r\n  jamais demeuré dans le Thibet.” A branch of the Huns, however, did\r\n  most assuredly dwell in that quarter, though we will not positively\r\n  assert that they were the Abtelites. The Haihaya was a great branch of\r\n  the Lunar race of Yayati, and appears early to have left India for the\r\n  northern regions, and would afford a more plausible etymology for the\r\n  Haiathelah than the Te-le, who dwelt on the waters (_ab_) of the Oxus.\r\n  This branch of the Hunnish race has also been termed Nephthalite, and\r\n  fancied one of the lost tribes of Israel [?].\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.1.37:\r\n\r\n  Ferishta, in the early part of his history [i. Introd. lxviii f.],\r\n  observes that, some centuries prior to Vikramaditya, the Hindus\r\n  abandoned the simple religion of their ancestors, made idols, and\r\n  worshipped the host of heaven, which faith they had from Kashmir, the\r\n  foundry of magic superstition.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.1.38:\r\n\r\n  Divested of allegory, it means simply that the supply of water was\r\n  rendered impure, and consequently useless to the Hindus, which\r\n  compelled them to abandon their defences and meet death in the open\r\n  field. Alau-d-din practised the same _ruse_ against the celebrated\r\n  Achal, the Khichi prince of Gagraun, which caused the surrender of\r\n  this impregnable fortress. “It matters not,” observes an historian\r\n  whose name I do not recollect, “whether such things are true, it is\r\n  sufficient that they were believed. We may smile at the mention of the\r\n  ghost, the evil genius of Brutus, appearing to him before the battle\r\n  of Pharsalia; yet it never would have been stated, had it not\r\n  assimilated with the opinions and prejudices of the age.” And we may\r\n  deduce a simple moral from “the parent orb refusing the aid of his\r\n  steed to his terrestrial offspring,” viz. that he was deserted by the\r\n  deity. Fountains sacred to the sun and other deities were common to\r\n  the Persians, Scythians, and Hindus, and both the last offered steeds\r\n  to him in sacrifice.

She was a\r\ndaughter of the Pramara prince of Chandravati [221], and had visited the\r\nshrine of the universal mother, Amba-Bhavani, in her native land, to\r\ndeposit upon the altar of the goddess a votive offering consequent to\r\nher expectation of offspring. She was on her return, when the\r\nintelligence arrived which blasted all her future hopes, by depriving\r\nher of her lord, and robbing him, whom the goddess had just granted to\r\nher prayers, of a crown. Excessive grief closed her pilgrimage. Taking\r\nrefuge in a cave in the mountains of Malia, she was delivered of a son.\r\nHaving confided the infant to a Brahmani of Birnagar named Kamlavati,\r\nenjoining her to educate the young prince as a Brahman, but to marry him\r\nto a Rajputni,[4.2.1] she mounted the funeral pile to join her lord.\r\nKamlavati, the daughter of the priest of the temple, was herself a\r\nmother, and she performed the tender offices of one to the orphan\r\nprince, whom she designated Goha, or ‘cave-born.’[4.2.2] The child was a\r\nsource of perpetual uneasiness to its protectors: he associated with\r\nRajput children, killing birds, hunting wild animals, and at the age of\r\neleven was totally unmanageable: to use the words of the legend, “How\r\nshould they hide the ray of the sun?”\r\n\r\n=The Legend of Goha.=—At this period Idar was governed by a chief of the\r\nsavage race of Bhil; his name, Mandalika.[4.2.3] The young Goha\r\nfrequented the forests in company with the Bhils, whose habits better\r\nassimilated with his daring nature than those of the Brahmans. He became\r\na favourite with the Vanaputras, or ‘children of the forest,’ who\r\nresigned to him Idar with its woods and mountains. The fact is mentioned\r\nby Abu-l Fazl,[4.2.4] and is still repeated by the bards, with a\r\ncharacteristic version of the incident, of which doubtless there were\r\nmany. The Bhils having determined in sport to elect a king, the choice\r\nfell on Goha; and one of the young savages, cutting his finger, applied\r\nthe blood as the tīka of sovereignty to his forehead. What was done in\r\nsport was confirmed by the old forest chief. The sequel fixes on Goha\r\nthe stain of ingratitude, for he slew his benefactor, and no motive is\r\nassigned in the legend for the deed. Goha’s name became the patronymic\r\nof his descendants, who were styled Guhilot, classically Grahilot, in\r\ntime softened to Gehlot.\r\n\r\nWe know very little concerning these early princes but that they dwelt\r\nin this mountainous region for eight generations; when the Bhils, tired\r\nof a foreign rule, assailed Nagaditya, the eighth prince, while hunting,\r\nand deprived him of life and Idar. The descendants of Kamlavati (the\r\nBirnagar Brahmani), who retained the office of priest in the family,\r\nwere again the preservers of the line of Valabhi. The infant Bappa, son\r\nof Nagaditya [222], then only three years old, was conveyed to the\r\nfortress of Bhander,[4.2.5] where he was protected by a Bhil of Yadu\r\ndescent. Thence he was removed for greater security to the wilds of\r\nParasar. Within its impervious recesses rose the three-peaked\r\n(_trikuta_) mountain, at whose base was the town of Nagindra,[4.2.6] the\r\nabode of Brahmans, who performed the rites of the ‘great god.’ In this\r\nretreat passed the early years of Bappa, wandering through these Alpine\r\nvalleys, amidst the groves of Bal and the shrines of the brazen calf.\r\n\r\nThe most antique temples are to be seen in these spots—within the dark\r\ngorge of the mountain, or on its rugged summit—in the depths of the\r\nforest, and at the sources of streams, where sites of seclusion, beauty,\r\nand sublimity alternately exalt the mind’s devotion. In these regions\r\nthe creative power appears to have been the earliest, and at one time\r\nthe sole, object of adoration, whose symbols, the serpent-wreathed\r\nphallus (lingam), and its companion, the bull, were held sacred even by\r\nthe ‘children of the forest.’ In these silent retreats Mahadeva\r\ncontinued to rule triumphant, and the most brilliant festivities of\r\nUdaipur were those where his rites are celebrated in the nine days\r\nsacred to him, when the Jains and Vaishnavas mix with the most zealous\r\nof his votaries; but the strange gods from the plains of the Yamuna and\r\nGanges have withdrawn a portion of the zeal of the Guhilots from their\r\npatron divinity Eklinga, whose diwan,[4.2.7] or viceregent, is the Rana.\r\nThe temple of Eklinga, situated in one of the narrow defiles leading to\r\nthe capital, is an immense structure, though more sumptuous than\r\nelegant. It is built entirely of white marble, most elaborately carved\r\nand embellished; but lying in the route of a bigoted foe, it has\r\nundergone many dilapidations. The brazen bull, placed under his own\r\ndome, facing the sanctuary of the phallus, is nearly of the natural\r\nsize, in a recumbent posture. It is cast (hollow) of good shape, highly\r\npolished and without flaw, except where the hammer of the Tatar had\r\nopened a passage in the hollow flank in search of treasure[4.2.8] [223].\r\n\r\n=The Marriage of Bappa.=—Tradition has preserved numerous details of\r\nBappa’s[4.2.9] infancy, which resembles the adventures of every hero or\r\nfounder of a race. The young prince attended the sacred kine, an\r\noccupation which was honourable even to the ‘children of the sun,’ and\r\nwhich they still pursue: possibly a remnant of their primitive Scythic\r\nhabits. The pranks of the royal shepherd are the theme of many a tale.\r\nOn the Jhal Jhulni, when swinging is the amusement of the youth of both\r\nsexes, the daughter of the Solanki chief of Nagda and the village\r\nmaidens had gone to the groves to enjoy this festivity, but they were\r\nunprovided with ropes. Bappa happened to be at hand, and was called by\r\nthe Rajput damsels to forward their sport. He promised to procure a rope\r\nif they would first have a game at marriage. One frolic was as good as\r\nanother, and the scarf of the Solankini was united to the garment of\r\nBappa, the whole of the village lasses joining hands with his as the\r\nconnecting link; and thus they performed the mystical number of\r\nrevolutions round an aged tree. This frolic caused his flight from\r\nNagda, and originated his greatness, but at the same time burthened him\r\nwith all these damsels; and hence a heterogeneous issue, whose\r\ndescendants still ascribe their origin to the prank of Bappa round the\r\nold mango-tree of Nagda. A suitable offer being shortly after made for\r\nthe young Solankini’s hand, the family priests of the bridegroom, whose\r\nduty it was, by his knowledge of palmistry, to investigate the fortunes\r\nof the bride, discovered that she was already married: intelligence\r\nwhich threw the family into the greatest consternation.[4.2.10] Though\r\nBappa’s power over his brother shepherds was too strong to create any\r\ndread of disclosure as to his being the principal in this affair, yet\r\nwas it too much to expect that a secret, in which no less than six\r\nhundred of the daughters of Eve were concerned, could long remain such?\r\nBappa’s mode of swearing his companions to secrecy is preserved. Digging\r\na small pit, and taking a pebble in his hand, “Swear,” cried he,\r\n“secrecy and obedience to me in good and in evil; that you will reveal\r\nto me all that you hear, and failing, desire that the good deeds of your\r\nforefathers may, like this pebble (dropping it into the pit) fall into\r\nthe Washerman’s well.”[4.2.11] They took the oath. The Solanki chief,\r\nhowever, heard that [224] Bappa was the offender, who, receiving from\r\nhis faithful scouts intimation of his danger, sought refuge in one of\r\nthe retreats which abound in these mountains, and which in after-times\r\nproved the preservation of his race. The companions of his flight were\r\ntwo Bhils: one of Undri, in the valley of the present capital; the other\r\nof Solanki descent, from Oghna Panarwa, in the western wilds. Their\r\nnames, Baleo and Dewa, have been handed down with Bappa’s; and the\r\nformer had the honour of drawing the tika of sovereignty with his own\r\nblood on the forehead of the prince, on the occasion of his taking the\r\ncrown from the Mori.[4.2.12] It is pleasing to trace, through a series\r\nof ages, the knowledge of a custom still ‘honoured in the observance.’\r\nThe descendants of Baleo of Oghna and the Undri Bhil still claim the\r\nprivilege of performing the tika on the inauguration of the descendants\r\nof Bappa.\r\n\r\n=Oghna Panarwa.=—Oghna Panarwa is the sole spot in India which enjoys a\r\nstate of natural freedom. Attached to no State, having no foreign\r\ncommunications, living under its own patriarchal head, its chief, with\r\nthe title of Rana, whom one thousand hamlets scattered over the\r\nforest-crowned valleys obey, can, if requisite, appear at ‘the head of\r\nfive thousand bows.’ He is a Bhumia Bhil of mixed blood, from the\r\nSolanki Rajput, on the old stock of pure (ujla) Bhils, the autochthones\r\n(if such there be of any country) of Mewar. Besides making the tika of\r\nblood from an incision in the thumb, the Oghna chief takes the prince by\r\nthe arm and seats him on the throne, while the Undri Bhil holds the\r\nsalver of spices and sacred grains of rice[4.2.13] used in making the\r\ntika.\r\n\r\nBut the solemnity of being seated on the throne of Mewar is so\r\nexpensive, that many of these rites have fallen into disuse. Jagat Singh\r\nwas the last prince whose coronation was conducted with the ancient\r\nmagnificence of this princely house. It cost the sum of ninety lakhs of\r\nrupees (£1,125,000), nearly one entire year’s revenue of the State in\r\nthe days of its prosperity, and which, taking into consideration the\r\ncomparative value of money, would amount to upwards of four millions\r\nsterling[4.2.14] [225].\r\n\r\nTo resume the narrative: though the flight of Bappa and its cause are\r\nperfectly natural, we have another episode; when the bard assuming a\r\nhigher strain has recourse to celestial machinery for the _dénouement_\r\nof this simple incident: but “an illustrious race must always be crowned\r\nwith its proper mythology.” Bappa who was the founder of a line of a\r\n‘hundred kings,’ feared as a monarch, adored as more than mortal, and,\r\naccording to the legend, ‘still living’ (_charanjiva_), deserves to have\r\nthe source of his pre-eminent fortune disclosed, which, in Mewar, it\r\nwere sacrilege to doubt. While he pastured the sacred kine in the\r\nvalleys of Nagindra, the princely shepherd was suspected of\r\nappropriating the milk of a favourite cow to his own use. He was\r\ndistrusted and watched, and although indignant, the youth admitted that\r\nthey had reason to suspect him, from the habitual dryness of the brown\r\ncow when she entered the pens at even.[4.2.15] He watched, and traced\r\nher to a narrow dell, when he beheld the udder spontaneously pouring its\r\nstores amidst the shrubs. Under a thicket of cane a hermit was reposing\r\nin a state of abstraction, from which the impetuosity of the shepherd\r\nsoon roused him. The mystery was revealed in the phallic symbol of the\r\n‘great God,’ which daily received the lacteal shower, and raised such\r\ndoubts of the veracity of Bappa.\r\n\r\nNo eye had hitherto penetrated into this natural sanctuary of the rites\r\nof the Hindu Creator, except the sages and hermits of ancient days (of\r\nwhom this was the celebrated Harita),[4.2.16] whom this bounteous cow\r\nalso fed.\r\n\r\nBappa related to the sage all he knew of himself, received his blessing,\r\nand retired; but he went daily to visit him, to wash his feet, carry\r\nmilk to him, and gather such wild flowers as were acceptable offerings\r\nto the deity. In return he received lessons of morality, and was\r\ninitiated into the mysterious rites of Siva: and at length he was\r\ninvested with the triple cordon of faith (_tin parwa zunnar_)[4.2.17] by\r\nthe hands of the sage, who became his spiritual guide, and bestowed on\r\nhis pupil the title of [226] ‘Regent (Diwan) of Eklinga.’ Bappa had\r\nproofs that his attentions to the saint and his devotions to Eklinga\r\nwere acceptable, by a visit from his consort, ‘the lion-born goddess.’\r\nFrom her hand he received the panoply of celestial fabrication, the work\r\nof Viswakarma (the Vulcan of Eastern mythology), which outvies all the\r\narms ever forged for Greek or Trojan. The lance, bow, quiver, and\r\narrows; a shield and sword (more famed than Balisarda)[4.2.18] which the\r\ngoddess girded on him with her own hand: the oath of fidelity and\r\ndevotion was the ‘relief’ of this celestial investiture. Thus initiated\r\ninto the mysteries of ‘the first’ (_adi_), admitted under the banners of\r\nBhavani, Harita resolved to leave his pupil to his fortunes, and to quit\r\nthe worship of the symbol for the presence of the deity in the mansions\r\nabove. He informed Bappa of his design, and commanded him to be at the\r\nsacred spot early on the following morn; but Bappa showed his\r\nmateriality by oversleeping himself, and on reaching the spot the sage\r\nhad already made some progress in his car, borne by the Apsaras, or\r\ncelestial messengers. He checked his aerial ascent to give a last token\r\nof affection to his pupil; and desiring him to reach up to receive his\r\nblessing, Bappa’s stature was extended to twenty cubits; but as he did\r\nnot reach the car, he was commanded to open his mouth, when the sage did\r\nwhat was recorded as performed, about the same period, by Muhammad, who\r\nspat into the mouth of his favourite nephew, Husain, the son of Ali.\r\nBappa showed his disgust and aversion by blinking, and the projected\r\nblessing fell on his foot, by which squeamishness he obtained only\r\ninvulnerability by weapons instead of immortality. The saint was soon\r\nlost in the cerulean space. Thus marked as the favourite of heaven, and\r\nhaving learned from his mother that he was nephew to the Mori prince of\r\nChitor, he ‘disdained a shepherd’s slothful life,’ and with some\r\ncompanions from these wilds quitted his retreat, and for the first time\r\nemerged into the plains. But, as if the brand of Bhavani was\r\ninsufficient, he met with another hermit in the forest of the Tiger\r\nMount,[4.2.19] the famed Gorakhnath, who presented to him the\r\ndouble-edged sword,[4.2.20] which, with the proper incantation, could\r\n‘sever rocks.’ With this he opened the road to fortune leading to the\r\nthrone of Chitor [227].\r\n\r\nChitor was at this period held by the Mori prince of the Pramar race,\r\nthe ancient lords of Malwa, then paramount sovereigns of Hindustan: but\r\nwhether this city was then the chief seat of power is not known. Various\r\npublic works, reservoirs, and bastions, yet retain the name of this\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nBappa’s connexion with the Mori[4.2.21] obtained him a good reception;\r\nhe was enrolled amongst the sawants or leaders, and a suitable estate\r\nconferred upon him. The inscription of the Mori prince’s reign, so often\r\nalluded to, affords a good idea of his power, and of the feudal manners\r\nof his court. He was surrounded by a numerous nobility, holding estates\r\non the tenure of military service, but whom he had disgusted by his\r\nneglect, and whose jealousy he had provoked by the superior regard shown\r\nto Bappa. A foreign foe appearing at this time, instead of obeying the\r\nsummons to attend, they threw up their grants, and tauntingly desired\r\nhim to call on his favourite.[4.2.22]\r\n\r\nBappa undertook the conduct of the war, and the chiefs, though\r\ndispossessed of their estates, accompanied him from a feeling of shame.\r\nThe foe was defeated and driven out of the country; but instead of\r\nreturning to Chitor, Bappa continued his course to the ancient seat of\r\nhis family, Gajni, expelled the ‘barbarian’ called Salim, placed on the\r\nthrone a chief of the Chaura tribe,[4.2.23] and returned with the\r\ndiscontented nobles. Bappa, on this occasion, is said to have married\r\nthe daughter of his enemy. The nobles quitted Chitor, leaving their\r\ndefiance with their prince. In vain were the spiritual preceptor\r\n(_Guru_) and foster-brother (_Dhabhai_) sent as ambassadors: their only\r\nreply was, that as they had ‘eaten his salt,’ they would forbear their\r\nvengeance for twelve months. The noble deportment of Bappa won their\r\nesteem, and they transferred to him their service and homage. With the\r\ntemptation of a crown, the gratitude of the Grahilot was given to the\r\nwinds. On return they assaulted and carried Chitor, and, in the words of\r\nthe chronicle, “Bappa took Chitor from the Mori and became himself the\r\nmor (crown) of the land”: he obtained by universal consent the title of\r\n‘sun of the Hindus (_Hindua suraj_), preceptor of princes (_Raj Guru_),\r\nand universal lord (_Chakravartin_)’ [228].\r\n\r\nHe had a numerous progeny, some of whom returned to their ancient seats\r\nin Saurashtra, whose descendants were powerful chieftains in that tract\r\nso late as Akbar’s reign.[4.2.24] Five sons went to Marwar, and the\r\nancient Gohils ‘of the land of Kher,’ expelled and driven to\r\nGohilwal,[4.2.25] have lost sight of their ancestry, and by a singular\r\nfatality are in possession of the wreck of Valabhipura, ignorant of its\r\nhistory and their connexion with it, mixing with Arabs and following\r\nmarine and mercantile pursuits; and the office of the bard having fallen\r\ninto disrepute, they cannot trace their forefathers beyond\r\nKherdhar.[4.2.26]\r\n\r\nThe close of Bappa’s career is the strangest part of the legend, and\r\nwhich it might be expected they would be solicitous to suppress.\r\nAdvanced in years, he abandoned his children and his country, carried\r\nhis arms west to Khorasan, and there established himself, and married\r\nnew wives from among the ‘barbarians,’ by whom he had a numerous\r\noffspring.[4.2.27]\r\n\r\nBappa had reached the patriarchal age of one hundred when he died. An\r\nold volume of historical anecdotes, belonging to the chief of Delwara,\r\nstates that he became an ascetic at the foot of Meru, where he was\r\nburied alive after having overcome all the kings of the west, as in\r\nIspahan, Kandahar, Kashmir, Irak, Iran, Turan, and Kafiristan; all of\r\nwhose daughters he married, and by whom he had one hundred and thirty\r\nsons, called the Nausshahra Pathans. Each of these founded a tribe,\r\nbearing the name of the mother. His Hindu children were ninety-eight in\r\nnumber, and were called Agni-upasi Suryavansi, or ‘sunborn\r\nfire-worshippers.’ The chronicles also record that (in like manner as\r\ndid the subjects of the Bactrian king Menander, though from a different\r\nmotive) the subjects of Bappa quarrelled for the disposal of his\r\nremains. The Hindu wished the fire to consume them; the ‘barbarian’ to\r\ncommit them to earth; but on raising the pall while the dispute was\r\nraging, innumerable flowers of the lotus were found in the place of the\r\nremains of mortality: these were conveyed and planted in the lake. This\r\nis precisely what is related of the end of the Persian Nushirwan[4.2.28]\r\n[229].\r\n\r\n=The Question of Dates.=—Having thus briefly sketched the history of the\r\nfounder of the Guhilot dynasty in Mewar, we must now endeavour to\r\nestablish the epoch of this important event in its annals. Although\r\nBappa Rawal was nine generations after the sack of Valabhipura, the\r\ndomestic annals give S. 191 (A.D. 135) for his birth; which the bards\r\nimplicitly following, have vitiated the whole chronology. An important\r\ninscription[4.2.29] in a character little known, establishes the fact of\r\nthe Mori dynasty being in possession of Chitor in S. 770 (A.D. 714). Now\r\nthe annals of the Rana’s house expressly state Bappa Rawal to be the\r\nnephew of the Mori prince of Chitor; that at the age of fifteen he was\r\nenrolled amongst the chieftains of his uncle, and that the vassals\r\n(before alluded to), in revenge for the resumption of their grants by\r\nthe Mori, dethroned him and elevated as their sovereign the youthful\r\nBappa. Notwithstanding this apparently irreconcilable anachronism, the\r\nfamily traditions accord with the inscription, except in date. Amidst\r\nsuch contradictions the development of the truth seemed impossible.\r\nAnother valuable inscription of S. 1024 (A.D. 968), though giving the\r\ngenealogy from Bappa to Sakti Kumar and corroborating that from Chitor,\r\nand which furnished convincing evidence, was not sanctioned by the\r\nprince or his chroniclers, who would admit nothing as valid that\r\nmilitated against their established era 191 for the birth of their\r\nfounder. After six years’ residence and unremitting search amid ruins,\r\narchives, inscriptions, traditions, and whatever could throw light upon\r\nthis point, the author quitted Udaipur with all these doubts in his\r\nmind, for Saurashtra, to prosecute his inquiries in the pristine abodes\r\nof the race. Then it was that he was rewarded, beyond his most sanguine\r\nexpectations, by the discovery of an inscription which reconciled these\r\nconflicting authorities and removed every difficulty. This marble, found\r\nin the celebrated temple of Somnath,[4.2.30] made mention of a distinct\r\nera, viz. the Valabhi Samvat, as being used in Saurashtra; which era was\r\nthree hundred and seventy-five years subsequent to Vikramaditya.[4.2.31]\r\n\r\nOn the sack of Valabhi thirty thousand families abandoned this ‘city of\r\na hundred temples,’ and led by their priests found a retreat for\r\nthemselves and their faith [230] in Mordardes (Marwar), where they\r\nerected the towns of Sandrai and Bali, in which latter we recognise the\r\nname of the city whence they were expelled. The religion of Valabhi, and\r\nconsequently of the colonists, was the Jain; and it was by a priest\r\ndescended from the survivors of this catastrophe, and still with their\r\ndescendants inhabiting those towns, that these most important documents\r\nwere furnished to the author. The Sandrai roll assigns the year 305\r\n(Valabhi era) for the destruction of Valabhi: another, also from Jain\r\nauthority, gives 205; and as there were but nine princes from Vijayasen,\r\nthe founder, to its fall, we can readily believe the first a numerical\r\nerror. Therefore 205 + 375 = 580 S. Vikrama (A.D. 524), for the invasion\r\nof Saurashtra by ‘the barbarians from the north,’ and sack of\r\nValabhipura.\r\n\r\nNow if from 770, the date of the Mori tablet, we deduct 580, there\r\nremains 190; justifying the pertinacity with which the chroniclers of\r\nMewar adhered to the date given in their annals for the birth of Bappa,\r\nviz. 191: though they were ignorant that this period was dated from the\r\nflight from Valabhipura.\r\n\r\nBappa, when he succeeded to the Mori prince, is said to have been\r\nfifteen years old; and his birth being one year anterior to the Mori\r\ninscription of 770 + 14 = S.V. 784 (A.D. 728),[4.2.32] is the period for\r\nthe foundation of the Guhilot dynasty in Mewar: since which, during a\r\nspace of eleven hundred years, fifty-nine princes lineally descended\r\nfrom Bappa have sat on the throne of Chitor.\r\n\r\nThough the bards and chroniclers will never forgive the temerity which\r\nthus curtails the antiquity of their founder, he is yet placed in the\r\ndawn of chivalry, when the Carlovingian dynasty was established in the\r\nwest, and when Walid, whose bands planted ‘the green standard’ on the\r\nEbro, was ‘commander of the faithful.’\r\n\r\nFrom the deserted and now forgotten ‘city of the sun,’ Aitpur, the abode\r\nof wild beasts and savage Bhils, another memorial[4.2.33] of the princes\r\nof Mewar was obtained. It relates to the prince Sakti Kumar. Its date is\r\nS. 1024 (A.D. 968), and it contains the names of fourteen of his\r\nancestors in regular succession. Amongst these is Bappa, or Saila. When\r\ncompared with the chronicles and [231] family archives, it was highly\r\ngratifying to find that, with the exception of one superfluous name and\r\nthe transposition of others, they were in perfect accordance.\r\n\r\nHume says, “Poets, though they disfigure the most certain history by\r\ntheir fictions, and use strange liberties with truth, when they are the\r\nsole historians, as among the Britons, have commonly some foundation for\r\ntheir wildest exaggerations.” The remark is applicable here; for the\r\nnames which had been mouldering for nine centuries, far from the abode\r\nof man, are the same they had worked into their poetical legends. It was\r\nat this exact epoch that the arms of Islam, for the first time, crossed\r\nthe Indus. In the ninety-fifth year of the Hegira,[4.2.34] Muhammad bin\r\nKasim, the general of the Caliph Walid, conquered Sind, and penetrated\r\n(according to early Arabian authors) to the Ganges; and although Elmacin\r\nmentions only Sind, yet other Hindu States were at this period convulsed\r\nfrom the same cause: witness the overthrow of Manikrae of Ajmer, in the\r\nmiddle of the eighth century, by a foe ‘coming in ships,’ Anjar\r\nspecified as the point where they landed. If any doubt existed that it\r\nwas Kasim who advanced to Chitor[4.2.35] and was defeated by Bappa, it\r\nwas set at rest by finding at this time in Chitor ‘Dahir,[4.2.36] the\r\nprince of Debil.’ Abu-l Fazl[4.2.37] records, from Arabian authorities,\r\nthat Dahir was lord of Sind, and resided at his capital, Debal, the\r\nfirst place captured by Kasim in 95. His miserable end, and the\r\ndestruction of his house, are mentioned by the historian, and account\r\nfor the son being found with the Mori prince of Chitor.\r\n\r\nNine princes intervened between Bappa and Sakti Kumar, in two centuries\r\n(twenty-two years to each reign): just the time which should elapse from\r\nthe founder, who ‘abandoned his country for Iran,’ in S. 820, or A.D.\r\n764. Having thus established four epochs in the earlier history of the\r\nfamily, viz.—Kanaksen’, A.D. 144; 2, Siladitya, and sack of Valabhi,\r\nA.D. 524; 3, Establishment in Chitor and Mewar, A.D. 720; 4, Sakti\r\nKumar, A.D. 1068;[4.2.38] we may endeavour to relieve this narrative by\r\nthe notices which regard their Persian descent [232].\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.2.1:\r\n\r\n  [This corroborates Bhandarkar’s theory that the Guhilots sprang from\r\n  Nāgar Brāhmans.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.2.2:\r\n\r\n  [This is a folk-etymology to explain the name Guhilot, probably\r\n  derived from Guha or Guhasena (A.D. 559-67), the fourth and apparently\r\n  the first great Valabhi monarch (_BG_, i.

What but\r\nthis spurious zeal could for a moment induce any genuine Hindu to\r\nbelieve that, only twelve centuries ago, ‘an eater of beef’ occupied the\r\nchair of Rama, and enjoyed by universal acclaim the title of ‘Sun of the\r\nHindus’; or that the most ancient dynasty in the world could owe its\r\nexistence to the last of the Sassanian kings:[4.3.1] that a slip from\r\nsuch a tree could be surreptitiously grafted on that majestic stem,\r\nwhich has flourished from the golden to the iron age, covering the land\r\nwith its branches? That there existed a marked affinity in religious\r\nrites between the Rana’s family and the Guebres, or ancient Persians, is\r\nevident. With both, the chief object of adoration was the sun; each bore\r\nthe image of the orb on their banners. The chief day in the seven[4.3.2]\r\nwas dedicated to the sun; to it is sacred the chief gate of the city,\r\nthe principal bastion of every fortress. But though the faith of Islam\r\nhas driven away the fairy inhabitants from the fountains of Mithras,\r\nthat of Surya has still its devotees on the summit of Chitor, as at\r\nValabhi: and could we trace with accuracy their creeds to a distant age,\r\nwe might discover them to be of one family, worshipping the sun at the\r\nfountains of the Oxus and Jaxartes.\r\n\r\nThe darkest period of Indian history is during the six centuries\r\nfollowing Vikramaditya, which are scarcely enlightened by a ray of\r\nknowledge: but India was undergoing great changes, and foreign tribes\r\nwere pouring in from the north. To this period, the sixth century, the\r\ngenealogies of the Puranas are brought down, which expressly declare\r\n(adopting the prophetic spirit to conceal [233] the alterations and\r\nadditions they then underwent) that at this time the genuine line of\r\nprinces would be extinct, and that a mixed race would rule conjointly\r\nwith foreign barbarians; as the Turushka, the Mauna,[4.3.3] the\r\nYavan,[4.3.4] the Gorind, and Garddhabin.[4.3.5] There is much of truth\r\nin this; nor is it to be doubted that many of the Rajput tribes entered\r\nIndia from the north-west regions about this period. Gor and Gardhaba\r\nhave the same signification; the first is Persian; the second its\r\nversion in Hindi, meaning the ‘wild ass,’ an appellation of the Persian\r\nmonarch Bahram, surnamed Gor from his partiality to hunting that animal.\r\nVarious authorities state Bahramgor being in India in the fifth century,\r\nand his having there left progeny by a princess of Kanauj. A passage\r\nextracted by the author from an ancient Jain MS. indicates that “in S.\r\n523 Raja Gardhabela, of Kakustha, or Suryavansa, ruled in Valabhipura.”\r\nIt has been surmised that Gardhabela was the son of Bahramgor, a son of\r\nwhom is stated to have obtained dominion at Patan; which may be borne in\r\nmind when the authorities for the Persian extraction of the Rana’s\r\nfamily are given.[4.3.6]\r\n\r\nThe Hindus, when conquered by the Muhammadans, naturally wished to gild\r\nthe chains they could not break. To trace a common, though distant,\r\norigin with the conquerors was to remove some portion of the taint of\r\ndishonour which arose from giving their daughters in marriage to the\r\nTatar emperors of Delhi; and a degree of satisfaction was derived from\r\nassuming that the blood thus corrupted once flowed from a common\r\nfountain[4.3.7] [234].\r\n\r\nFurther to develop these claims of Persian descent, we shall commence\r\nwith an extract from the Upadesa Prasād, a collection of historic\r\nfragments in the Magadhi dialect. \"In Gujardes (Gujarat) there are\r\neighty-four cities. In one of these, Kaira, resided the Brahman\r\nDevaditya, the expounder of the Vedas. He had an only child, Subhaga\r\n(_of good fortune_) by name, at once a maiden and a widow. Having\r\nlearned from her preceptor the solar incantation, incautiously repeating\r\nit, the sun appeared and embraced her, and she thence became\r\npregnant.[4.3.8] The affliction of her father was diminished when he\r\ndiscovered the parent; nevertheless [as others might be less charitable]\r\nhe sent her with a female attendant to Valabhipura, where she was\r\ndelivered of twins, male and female. When grown up the boy was sent to\r\nschool; but being eternally plagued about his mysterious birth, whence\r\nhe received the nickname of Ghaibi (‘concealed’), in a fit of irritation\r\nhe one day threatened to kill his mother if she refused to disclose the\r\nauthor of his existence. At this moment the sun revealed himself: he\r\ngave the youth a pebble, with which it was sufficient to touch his\r\ncompanions in order to overcome them. Being carried before the Balhara\r\nprince, who menaced Ghaibi, the latter slew him with the pebble, and\r\nbecame himself sovereign of Saurashtra, taking the name of\r\nSiladitya[4.3.9] (from _sila_, ‘a stone or pebble,’ and _aditya_, ‘the\r\nsun’): his sister was married to the Raja of Broach.\" Such is the\r\nliteral translation of a fragment totally unconnected with the history\r\nof the Rana’s family, though evidently bearing upon it. The father of\r\nSiladitya, according to the Sandrai roll and other authorities of that\r\nperiod, is Suraj (the sun) Rao, though two others make a Somaditya\r\nintervene[4.3.10] [235].\r\n\r\nLet us see what Abu-l Fazl says of the descent of the Ranas from\r\nNushirwan: “The chief of the State was formerly called Rāwal, but for a\r\nlong time past has been known as Rāna. He is of the Ghelot clan, and\r\npretends to descent from Noshirwān the Just. An ancestor of this family\r\nthrough the vicissitudes of fortune came to Berār and was distinguished\r\nas the chief of Narnālah. About eight hundred years previous to the\r\npresent time[4.3.11] Narnālah was taken by the enemy and many were\r\nslain. One Bāpa, a child, was carried by his mother from this scene of\r\ndesolation to Mewār, and found refuge with Rājah Mandalīkh, a\r\nBhīl.”[4.3.12]\r\n\r\nThe work which has furnished all the knowledge which exists on the\r\nPersian ancestry of the Mewar princes is the _Maasiru-l-Umara_, or that\r\n(in the author’s possession) founded on it, entitled _Bisatu-l-Ghanim_,\r\nor ‘Display of the Foe,’ written in A.H. 1204[4.3.13] [A.D. 1789]. The\r\nwriter of this work styles himself Lachhmi Narayan Shafik Aurangabadi,\r\nor ‘the rhymer of Aurangabad.’ He professes to give an account of\r\nSivaji, the founder of the Mahratta empire; for which purpose he goes\r\ndeep into the lineage of the Ranas of Mewar, from whom Sivaji was\r\ndescended,[4.3.14] quoting at length the Maasiru-l-Umara, from which the\r\nfollowing is a literal translation: \"It is well known that the Rajas of\r\nUdaipur are exalted over all the princes of Hind. Other Hindu princes,\r\nbefore they can succeed to the throne of their fathers, must receive the\r\nkhushka, or tilak of regality and investiture, from them. This type of\r\nsovereignty is received with humility and veneration. The khushka of\r\nthese princes is made with human blood: their title is Rana, and they\r\ndeduce [236] their origin from Noshirwan-i-Adil (_i.e._ the Just), who\r\nconquered the countries of ——,[4.3.15] and many parts of Hindustan.\r\nDuring his lifetime his son Noshizad, whose mother was the daughter of\r\nKaiser of Rum,[4.3.16] quitted the ancient worship and embraced the\r\n‘faith[4.3.17] of the Christians,’ and with numerous followers entered\r\nHindustan. Thence he marched a great army towards Iran, against his\r\nfather Noshirwan; who despatched his general, Rambarzin,[4.3.18] with\r\nnumerous forces to oppose him. An action ensued, in which Noshizad was\r\nslain; _but his issue remained in Hindustan, from whom are descended the\r\nRanas of Udaipur_. Nushirwan had a wife from the Khakhan[4.3.19] of\r\nChina, by whom he had a son called Hormuz, declared heir to the throne\r\nshortly before his death. As according to the faith of the\r\nfire-worshippers[4.3.20] it is not customary either to bury or to burn\r\nthe dead, but to leave the corpse exposed to the rays of the sun, so it\r\nis said the body of Nushirwan has to this day suffered no decay, but is\r\nstill fresh.\"\r\n\r\nI now come to the account of Yazd, \"the son of Shahriyar, the son of\r\nKhusru Parves, the son of Hormuz, the son of Nushirwan.\r\n\r\n\"Yazd was the last king of Ajam. It is well known he fought many battles\r\nwith the Muhammadans. In the fifteenth year of the caliphat, Rustam, son\r\nof Ferokh, a great chief, was slain in battle by Saad-bin-wakas, who\r\ncommanded for Omar, which was the death-blow to the fortunes of the\r\nhouse of Sassan: so that a remnant of it did not remain in A.H. 31, when\r\nIran was seized by the Muhammadans. This battle had lasted four days\r\nwhen Rustam Ferokzad was slain by the hand of Hilkal, the son of Al\r\nKumna, at Saad’s command [237]; though Firdausi asserts by Saad himself.\r\nThirty thousand Muslims were slain, and the same number of the men of\r\nAjam. To count the spoils was a torment. During this year (the\r\nthirty-first), the sixteenth of the prophet,[4.3.21] the era of the\r\nHegira was introduced. In A.H. 17 Abu Musa of Ashur seized Hormuz, the\r\nson of the uncle of Yazdegird, whom he sent with Yazdegird’s daughter to\r\nImam Husain, and another daughter to Abubakr.\r\n\r\n\"Thus far have I[4.3.22] extracted from the history of the\r\nfire-worshippers. He who has a mind to examine these, let him do so. The\r\npeople of the religion of Zardusht have a full knowledge of all these\r\nevents, with their dates; for the pleasure of their lives is the\r\nobtaining accounts of antiquity and astronomical knowledge, and their\r\nbooks contain information of two and three thousand years. It is also\r\ntold, that when the fortunes of Yazdegird were on the wane, his family\r\ndispersed to different regions. The second daughter, Shahr Banu, was\r\nmarried to Imam Husain,[4.3.23] who, when he fell a martyr (shahid), an\r\nangel carried her to heaven. The third daughter, Banu, was seized by a\r\nplundering Arab and carried into the wilds of Chichik, thirty coss from\r\nYazd. Praying to God for deliverance, she instantly disappeared; and the\r\nspot is still held sacred by the Parsis, and named ‘the secret abode of\r\nperfect purity.’ Hither, on the twenty-sixth of the month Bahman, the\r\nParsis yet repair to pass a month in pilgrimage, living in huts under\r\nindigenous vines skirting the rock, out of whose fissures water falls\r\ninto a fountain below: but if the unclean approach the spring, it ceases\r\nto flow.\r\n\r\n“Of the eldest daughter of Yazdegird, Maha Banu, the Parsis have no\r\naccounts; but the books of Hind give evidence to her arrival in that\r\ncountry, and that from her issue is the tribe Sesodia. But, at all\r\nevents, this race is either of the seed of Nushishad, the son of\r\nNushirwan, or of that of the daughter of Yazdegird.”[4.3.24]\r\n\r\nThus have we adduced, perhaps, all the points of evidence for the\r\nsupposed Persian origin of the Rana’s family. The period of the invasion\r\nof Saurashtra by Nushishad, who mounted the throne A.D. 531, corresponds\r\nwell with the sack of Valabhi, A.D. 524 [238]. The army he collected in\r\nLaristan to depose his father might have been from the Parthians, Getae,\r\nHuns, and other Scythic races then on the Indus, though it is unlikely,\r\nwith such an object in view as the throne of Persia, that he would waste\r\nhis strength in Saurashtra. Khusru Parvez, grandson of Nushirwan the\r\ngreat, and who assumed this title according to Firdausi, married Marian,\r\nthe daughter of Maurice, the Greek emperor of Byzantium. She bore him\r\nShirauah (the Siroes of the early Christian writers), who slew his\r\nfather. It is difficult to separate the actions of the two Nushirwans,\r\nand still more to say which of them merited the epithet of _adil_, or\r\n‘just.’\r\n\r\nAccording to the ‘Tables’ in Moreri,[4.3.25] Nushishad, son of Khusru\r\nthe Great, reigned from A.D. 531 to 591. This is opposed to the\r\n_Maasiru-l-Umara_, which asserts that he was slain during his rebellion.\r\nSiroes, son of Khusru (the second Nushirwan) by his wife Marian,\r\nalternately called the friend and foe of the Christians, did raise the\r\nstandard of revolt, and met the fate attributed to Nushishad; on which\r\nYazdegird, his nephew, was proclaimed. The crown was intended for\r\nShirauah’s younger brother, which caused the revolt, during which the\r\nelder sought refuge in India.\r\n\r\nThese revolutions in the Sassanian house were certainly simultaneous\r\nwith those which occurred in the Rana’s, and no barrier existed to the\r\npolitical intercourse at least between the princely worshippers of Surya\r\nand Mithras. It is, therefore, curious to speculate even on the\r\npossibility of such a pedigree to a family whose ancestry is lost in the\r\nmists of time; and it becomes interesting when, from so many authentic\r\nsources, we can raise testimonies which would furnish, to one even\r\nuntinctured with the love of hypothesis, grounds for giving ancestors to\r\nthe Ranas in Maurice of Byzantium and Cyrus (Khusru) of Persia [239]. We\r\nhave a singular support to these historic relics in a geographical fact,\r\nthat places on the site of the ancient Valabhi a city called Byzantium,\r\nwhich almost affords conclusive proof that it must have been the son of\r\nNushirwan who captured Valabhi and Gajni, and destroyed the family of\r\nSiladitya; for it would be a legitimate occasion to name such conquest\r\nafter the city where his Christian mother had had birth.[4.3.26]\r\nWhichever of the propositions we adopt at the command of the author of\r\nThe Annals of Princes, namely, “that the Sesodia race is of the seed of\r\nNushishad, son of Nushirwan, or of that of Mahabanu, daughter of\r\nYazdegird,” we arrive at a singular and startling conclusion, viz. that\r\nthe ‘Hindua Suraj, descendant of a hundred kings,’ the undisputed\r\npossessor of the honours of Rama, the patriarch of the Solar race, is\r\nthe issue of a Christian princess: that the chief prince amongst the\r\nnations of Hind can claim affinity with the emperors of ‘the mistress of\r\nthe world,’ though at a time when her glory had waned, and her crown had\r\nbeen transferred from the Tiber to the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\nBut though I deem it morally impossible that the Ranas should have their\r\nlineage from any _male_ branch of the Persian house, I would not equally\r\nassert that Mahabanu, the fugitive daughter of Yazdegird, may not have\r\nfound a husband, as well as sanctuary, with the prince of Saurashtra;\r\nand she may be the Subhagna (mother of Siladitya), whose mysterious\r\namour with the ‘sun’[4.3.27] compelled her to abandon her native city of\r\nKaira. The son of Marian had been in Saurashtra, and it is therefore not\r\nunlikely that her grandchild should there seek protection in the\r\nreverses of her family.\r\n\r\nThe Salic law is here in full force, and honours, though never acquired\r\nby the female, may be stained by her; yet a daughter of the noble house\r\nof Sassan might be permitted to perpetuate the line of Rama without the\r\nreproach of taint.[4.3.28]\r\n\r\nWe shall now abandon this point to the reader, and take leave of\r\nYazdegird,[4.3.29] the last of the house of Sassan, in the words of the\r\nhistorian of Rome: “Avec lui, on voit périr pour jamais la gloire et\r\nl’empire des Perses. Les rochers du Mazendaran et les sables du Kerman,\r\nfurent les seuls[4.3.30] asiles que les vainqueurs laissèrent aux\r\nsectateurs de Zoroastre”[4.3.31] [240].\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.3.1:\r\n\r\n  Yezdegird died A.D. 651.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.3.2:\r\n\r\n  _Surajwar_, or _Adityawar_, Sun-day; and the other days of the week,\r\n  from the other planets, which Western nations have taken from the\r\n  East.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.3.3:\r\n\r\n  See _History of the Tribes_, pp. 123, 135, articles ‘Takshak,’ and\r\n  ‘Jhala,’ or _Makwahana_, in all probability the _Mauna_ of the\r\n  _Puranas_ [?].\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.3.4:\r\n\r\n  The Yavan, or Greek princes, who apparently continued to rule within\r\n  the Indus after the Christian era, were either the remains of the\r\n  Bactrian dynasty or the independent kingdom of Demetrius or\r\n  Apollodotus, who ruled in the Panjab, having as their capital Sagala,\r\n  changed by Demetrius to Euthymedia. Bayer says, in his _Hist. Reg.\r\n  Bact._, p. 84: “I find from Claudius Ptolemy, that there was a city\r\n  within the Hydaspes yet nearer the Indus, called Sagala, also\r\n  Euthymedia; but I scarcely doubt that Demetrius called it Euthydemia,\r\n  from his father, after his death and that of Menander. Demetrius was\r\n  deprived of his patrimony A.U.C. 562.” [The site of Sagala is\r\n  uncertain—Chiniot, Shāhkot, Siālkot (_IGI_, ii. 80 f.; McCrindle,\r\n  _Ptolemy_, 122 ff.).]\r\n\r\n  On this ancient city, Sagala, I have already said much; conjecturing\r\n  it to be the Salbhanpura of the Yadus when driven from Zabulistan, and\r\n  that of the Yuch-chi or Yuti, who were fixed there from Central Asia\r\n  in the fifth century, and if so early as the second century, when\r\n  Ptolemy wrote, may have originated the change of Yuti-media, the\r\n  ‘Central Yuti.’ The numerous medals which I possess, chiefly found\r\n  within the probable limits of the Greek kingdom of Sagala, either\r\n  belong to these princes or the Parthian kings of Minnagara on the\r\n  Indus. The legends are in Greek on one side, and in the Sassanian\r\n  character on the reverse. Hitherto I have not deciphered the names of\r\n  any but those of Apollodotus and Menander; but the titles of ‘Great\r\n  King,’ ‘Saviour,’ and other epithets adopted by the Arsacidae, are\r\n  perfectly legible. The devices, however, all incline me to pronounce\r\n  them Parthian. It would be curious to ascertain how these Greeks and\r\n  Parthians gradually merged into the Hindu population [see _IGI_, ii.\r\n  137].\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.3.5:\r\n\r\n  [The list in the Vishnu Purāna (474 f.) gives 7 Abhīras, 10\r\n  Garddhabas, 16 Sakas, 14 Tushāras, 13 Mundas, 11 Maunas.

They gravely assert that Akbar visited\r\n  his ancient hermitage at the confluence of the Ganges and Jumna, and\r\n  excavated the implements of penance used by him in his former shape,\r\n  as one of the sages of ancient times; while such is their aversion to\r\n  Aurangzeb, that they declare the final avatar, Time (_Kal_), on his\r\n  white steed, will appear in his person. The Jaisalmer annals affirm\r\n  that the whole Turkish (_Turushka_) race of Chagatai are of Yadu\r\n  stock; while the Jam Jareja of Cutch traces his descent from the\r\n  Persian Jamshid, contemporary with Solomon.

Ali Ibrahim, a learned native of Benares, was\r\n  Wilford’s authority for asserting the Rana’s Persian descent, who\r\n  stated to him that he had seen the original history, which was\r\n  entitled, Origin of the Peishwas from the Ranas of Mewar. (Ibrahim\r\n  must have meant the Satara princes, whose ministers were the Peshwas.)\r\n  From this authority three distinct emigrations of the Guebres, or\r\n  ancient Persians, are recorded, from Persia into Gujarat. The first in\r\n  the time of Abu Bakr, A.D. 631; the second on the defeat of Yazdegird,\r\n  A.D. 651; and the third when the descendants of Abbas began to\r\n  prevail, A.D. 749. Also that a son of Noshirwan landed near Surat with\r\n  eighteen thousand of his subjects, from Laristan, and were well\r\n  received by the prince of the country. Abu-l Fazl confirms this\r\n  account by saying, \"the followers of Zoroaster, when they fled from\r\n  Persia, settled in _Surat_,\" the contracted term for the peninsular of\r\n  Saurashtra, as well as the city of this name [_Āīn_, ii. 243].\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.3.15:\r\n\r\n  The names are obliterated in the original.

From\r\n  the striking coincidence of these original and decisive authorities,\r\n  we may rest assured that they had recourse to ancient records, both of\r\n  the Guebres and the Hindus, for the basis of their histories, which\r\n  research may yet discover.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.3.16:\r\n\r\n  Maurice, emperor of Byzantium.

I have already hinted that the Assyrian\r\n  Medes might be descendants of Hyaspa, a branch of the Indu-Mede of the\r\n  family of Yayati which bore the name of _Kausika_.

Not unlike the Rajput axiom,\r\n  though more coarsely expressed; “It is, who planted the tree, not\r\n  where did it grow,” that marks his idea of the comparative value of\r\n  the side whence honours originate; though purity of blood in both\r\n  lines is essential.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.3.29:\r\n\r\n  A new era had commenced, not of Yazdegird’s accession, as is supposed,\r\n  which would have been vain indeed, when the throne was tottering under\r\n  him, but consequent to the completion of the grand cycle of 1440\r\n  years.

We shall not, however, overleap the four\r\nintervening centuries, though we may not be able to fill up the reigns\r\nof the eighteen princes[4.4.2] whose “banner at this time was a golden\r\nsun on a crimson field,”[4.4.3] and several of whose names yet live\r\nrecorded “with an iron pen on the rock” of their native abodes.\r\n\r\nAn intermediate period, from Bappa to Samarsi, that of Sakti Kumar, is\r\nfixed by the Aitpur inscription in S. 1024 (A.D. 968); and from the more\r\nperishable yet excellent authority of an ancient Jain MS. the era of\r\nAllat, the ancestor of Sakti Kumar, was S. 922 (A.D. 866), four\r\ngenerations anterior. From Bappa’s departure for Iran, in A.D. 764, to\r\nthe subversion of Hindu dominion in the reign of Samarsi, in A.D. 1193,\r\nwe find recorded an intermediate Islamite invasion. This was during the\r\nreign of Khuman, between A.D. 812 and 836, which event forms the chief\r\nsubject of the Khuman-Raesa, the most ancient of the poetic chronicles\r\nof Mewar [241].\r\n\r\nAs the history of India at this period is totally dark, we gladly take\r\nadvantage of the lights thus afforded. By combining these facts with\r\nwhat is received as authentic, though scarcely less obscure or more\r\nexact than these native legends, we may furnish materials for the future\r\nhistorian. With this view, let us take a rapid sketch of the irruptions\r\nof the Arabians into India, from the rise of Islamism to the foundation\r\nof the Ghaznivid empire, which sealed the fate of the Hindus. The\r\nmaterials are but scanty. El-Makin, in his history of the Caliphs,\r\npasses over such intercourse almost without notice. Abu-l-Fazl, though\r\nnot diffuse, is minute in what he does say, and we can confide in his\r\nveracity. Ferishta has a chapter devoted to this subject, which merits a\r\nbetter translation than yet exists.[4.4.4] We shall, however, in the\r\nfirst place, touch on Bappa’s descendants, till we arrive at the point\r\nproper for the introduction of the intended sketch.\r\n\r\nOf the twenty-four tribes of Guhilot, several issued from the founder,\r\nBappa. Shortly after the conquest of Chitor, Bappa proceeded to\r\nSaurashtra and married the daughter of Yusufgol, prince of the island of\r\nBandardiva.[4.4.5] With his bride he conveyed to Chitor the statue of\r\nVyanmata, the tutelary goddess of her race, who still divides with\r\nEklinga the devotion of the Guhilot princes. The temple in which he\r\nenshrined this islandic goddess yet stands on the summit of Chitor, with\r\nmany other monuments assigned by tradition to Bappa. This princess bore\r\nhim Aparajit, who from being born in Chitor was nominated successor to\r\nthe throne, to the exclusion of his less fortunate elder brother, Asil\r\n(born of the daughter of the Kaba (Pramara) prince of Kalibao near\r\nDwaraka), who, however, obtained possessions in Saurashtra, and founded\r\na race called the Asila Guhilots,[4.4.6] whose descendants were so\r\nnumerous, even in Akbar’s reign, as to [242] be supposed able to bring\r\ninto the field fifty thousand men at arms. We have nothing important to\r\nrecord of the actions of Aparajit, who had two sons, Kalbhoj[4.4.7] and\r\nNandkumar. Kalbhoj succeeded Aparajit, and his warlike qualities are\r\nextolled in an inscription discovered by the author in the valley of\r\nNagda. Nandkumar slew Bhimsen Dor (_Doda_), and possessed himself of\r\nDeogarh in the Deccan.\r\n\r\n=Khumān I.=—Khuman succeeded Kalbhoj. His name is remarkable in the\r\nhistory of Mewar. He came to the throne at the beginning of the ninth\r\ncentury, when Chitor was assailed by another formidable invasion of\r\nMuhammadans. The chief object of the Khuman Raesa is to celebrate the\r\ndefence made on this occasion, and the value of this Raesa consists in\r\nthe catalogue of the princes who aided in defending this bulwark of the\r\nHindu faith. The bard, in an animated strain, makes his sovereign on\r\nthis occasion successfully defend the ‘crimson standard’ of Mewar, treat\r\nwith contempt the demand for tribute, and after a violent assault, in\r\nwhich the ‘barbarian’ is driven back, follow and discomfit him in the\r\nplan, carrying back the hostile leader, Mahmud, captive. With this\r\nevent, which introduces the name of Mahmud two centuries before the\r\nconqueror of Ghazni, we will pause, and resume the promised sketch of\r\nthe intercourse of Arabia and Hindustan at this period.\r\n\r\n=The Muhammadan Invasion, A.D. 644-55.=—The first intimation of the\r\nMoslems attempting the invasion of India is during the caliphat of Omar,\r\nwho built the port of Bassorah at the mouth of the Tigris, chiefly to\r\nsecure the trade of Gujarat and Sind; into which latter country a\r\npowerful army penetrated under Abul Aas,[4.4.8] who was killed in battle\r\nat Aror. The Caliph Osman, who succeeded Omar, sent to explore the state\r\nof India, while he prepared an army to invade it in person: a design\r\nwhich he never fulfilled. The generals of the Caliph Ali made conquests\r\nin Sind, which they abandoned at Ali’s death. While Yazid was governor\r\nof Khorasan several attempts were made on India, as also during the\r\ncaliphat of Abdu-l Malik, but without any lasting [243] results. It was\r\nnot till the reign of Walid[4.4.9] that any successful invasion took\r\nplace. He not only finally conquered Sind and the adjoining continent of\r\nIndia, but rendered tributary all that part of India on this side the\r\nGanges.[4.4.10] What an exalted idea must we not form of the energy and\r\nrapidity of such conquests, when we find the arms of Islam at once on\r\nthe Ganges and the Ebro, and two regal dynasties simultaneously cut off,\r\nthat of Roderic, the last of the Goths of Andaloos, and Dahir Despati in\r\nthe valley of the Indus. It was in A.H. 99 (A.D. 712, S. 774) that\r\nMuhammad bin Kasim vanquished and slew Dahir, prince of Sind, after\r\nnumerous conflicts. Amongst the spoils of victory sent to the caliph on\r\nthis occasion were the daughters of the subjugated monarch, who were the\r\ncause of Kasim’s destruction,[4.4.11] when he was on the eve of carrying\r\nthe war against Raja [244] Harchand of Kanauj. Some authorities state\r\nthat he actually prosecuted it; and as Sind remained a dependency of the\r\ncaliphat during several successive reigns, the successor of Kasim may\r\nhave executed his plans. Little is said of India from this period to the\r\nreign of Al-Mansur, except in regard to the rebellion of Yazid in\r\nKhorasan, and the flight of his son to Sind. The eight sovereigns, who\r\nrapidly followed, were too much engaged with the Christians of the west\r\nand the Huns on the Caspian to think of India. Their armies were then in\r\nthe heart of France, which was only saved from the Koran by their\r\noverthrow at Tours by Charles Martel.\r\n\r\n                GUHILOT AND CONTEMPORARY PRINCES[4.4.13]\r\n\r\n     GUHILOT     │  Eras.  │ CALIPHS OF │        Eras.         │Remarks.\r\n     PRINCES     │    │    │BAGHDAD and │          │           │\r\n                 │ S  │C.E.│  KINGS OF  │   A.H.   │   A.D.    │\r\n                 │    │    │  GHAZNI.   │          │           │\r\n ────────────────┼────┼────┼────────────┼──────────┼───────────┼────────────────────\r\n                 │    │    │_Caliphs of_│          │           │\r\n                 │    │    │ _Baghdad._ │          │           │\r\n                 │    │    │            │          │           │\r\n Bappa,      born│769 │713 │ Walid (7th │ 86 to 96 │705 to 715 │Conquered India to\r\n                 │    │    │  Ummaiya   │          │           │the Ganges.\r\n                 │    │    │  Caliph)   │          │           │\r\n                 │    │    │            │          │           │\r\n ———     obtained│784 │728 │  Omar II.  │99 to 102 │718 to 721 │Sindi conquered.

The domestic history brings the enemy\r\nassailant of Chitor from Zabulistan; and as the leader’s name is given\r\n_Mahmud Khorasan Pat_, there can be little doubt that it is an error\r\narising from ignorance of the copyist, and should be _Mamun_.\r\n\r\n=Mahmūd’s Invasion.=—Within twenty years after this event, the sword of\r\nconquest and conversion was withdrawn from India, and Sind was the only\r\nprovince left to Mutawakkil (A.D. 850 [847-861]), the grandson of Harun,\r\nfor a century after whom the throne of Baghdad, like that of ancient\r\nRome, was sold by her praetorians to the highest bidder. From this time\r\nwe find no mention whatever of Hindustan, or even of Sind, until\r\nSabuktigin,[4.4.16] governor of Khorasan, hoisted the standard of\r\nindependent sovereignty at Ghazni. In A.H. 365 (A.D. 974) he carried his\r\narms [245] across the Indus, forcing the inhabitants to abandon the\r\nreligion of their ancestors, and to read the Koran from the altars of\r\nBal and Krishna. Towards the close of this century he made his last\r\ninvasion, accompanied by his son, the celebrated Mahmud, destined to be\r\nthe scourge of the Hindu race, who early imbibed the paternal lesson\r\ninculcating the extirpation of infidels. Twelve several visitations did\r\nMahmud make with his Tatar hordes, sweeping India of her riches,\r\ndestroying her temples and architectural remains, and leaving the\r\ncountry plunged in poverty and ignorance. From the effect of these\r\nincursions she never recovered; for though she had a respite of a\r\ncentury between Mahmud and the final conquest, it was too short to\r\nrepair what it had cost ages to rear: the temples of Somnath, of Chitor,\r\nand Girnar are but types of the magnificence of past times. The memorial\r\nof Sakti Kumar proves him to have been the contemporary of Sabuktigin,\r\nand to one of his son’s visitations is attributed the destruction of the\r\n‘city of the sun’ (Aitpur),[4.4.17] his capital.\r\n\r\n=Attack on Chitor.=—Having thus condensed the little information\r\nafforded by Muhammadan historians of the connexion between the caliphs\r\nof Baghdad and princes of Hind, from the first to the end of the fourth\r\ncentury of the Hegira, we shall revert to the first recorded attack on\r\nthe Mori prince of Chitor, which brought Bappa into notice. This was\r\neither by Yazid or Muhammad bin Kasim from Sind.[4.4.18] Though in the\r\nhistories of the caliphs we can only expect to find recorded those\r\nexpeditions which were successful, or had some lasting results, there\r\nare inroads of their revolted lieutenants or their frontier deputies,\r\nwhich frequently, though indistinctly, alluded to in Hindu annals, have\r\nno place in Muhammadan records. Throughout the period mentioned there\r\nwas a stir amongst the Hindu nations, in which we find confusion and\r\ndethronement from an unknown invader, who is described as coming\r\nsometimes by Sind, sometimes by sea, and not unfrequently as a demon and\r\nmagician; but invariably as _mlechchha_, or ‘barbarian.’[4.4.19] From S.\r\n750 to S. 780 (A.D. 694 to [246] 724), the annals of the Yadus, the\r\nChauhans, the Chawaras, and the Guhilots, bear evidence to simultaneous\r\nconvulsions in their respective houses at this period. In S. 750 (A.H.\r\n75) the Yadu Bhatti was driven from his capital Salpura in the Panjab,\r\nacross the Sutlej into the Indian desert; the invader named Farid. At\r\nthe same period Manika Rae, the Chauhan prince of Ajmer, was assailed\r\nand slain.[4.4.20]\r\n\r\n=The Muster of the Clans.=—The first of the Khichi princes who occupied\r\nthe Duab of Sindsagar in the Panjab, as well as the ancestor of the\r\nHaras established in Golkonda, was expelled at the same time. The\r\ninvader is treated in the genuine Hindu style as a Danava, or demon, and\r\nis named Ghairaram[4.4.21] (_i.e._ restless), from Kujliban,[4.4.22] a\r\nterm geographically given to a portion of the Himalaya mountains about\r\nthe glaciers of the Ganges. The ancestor of the founder of Patan was\r\nexpelled from his petty islandic dominion on the coast of Saurashtra at\r\nthe same time. This is the period when Yazid was the caliph’s lieutenant\r\nin Khorasan, and when the arms of Walid conquered to the Ganges; nor is\r\nthere a doubt that Yazid or Kasim was the author of all these\r\nrevolutions in the Hindu dynasties. We are supported in this by the\r\nnames of the princes contained in the catalogue who aided to defend\r\nChitor and the Mori prince on this occasion. It is evident that Chitor\r\nwas, alternately with Ujjain, the seat of sovereignty of the Pramara at\r\nthis period, and, as it became the rallying point of the Hindus, that\r\nthis race was the first in consequence.[4.4.23] We find the prince of\r\nAjmer, and the quotas of Saurashtra and Gujarat [247]; Angatsi, lord of\r\nthe Huns; Busa, the lord of the North; Sheo, the prince of the Jarejas;\r\nthe Johya, lord of Jangaldes; the Aswaria, the Sepat, the Kulhar, the\r\nMalan, the Ohir, the Hul, and many others, having nothing of the Hindu\r\nin name, now extinct. But the most conspicuous is ‘Dahir Despati from\r\nDebal.’ This is erroneously written Delhi, the seat of the Tuars;\r\nwhereas we recognize the name of the prince of Sind, slain by Kasim,\r\nwhose expatriated son doubtless found refuge in Chitor.[4.4.24]\r\n\r\n=The Defeat of the Enemy.=—This attack on the Mori prince was defeated\r\nchiefly through the bravery of the youthful Guhilot. The foe from\r\nKujliban, though stated to have advanced by Mathura, retreated by\r\nSaurashtra and Sind, pursued by Bappa. He found the ancient seat of his\r\nancestors, Gajni,[4.4.25] still in the possession of the ‘Asur’: a term\r\nas well as _mlechchha_, or ‘barbarian,’ always given to the Islamite at\r\nthis period. Salim, who held Gajni, was attacked and forced to\r\nsurrender, and Bappa inducted into this stronghold of his ancestors a\r\nnephew of his own. It is no less singular than honourable to their\r\nveracity that the annals should record the fact, so contrary to their\r\nreligion, of Bappa having married the daughter of the conquered Salim;\r\nand we have a right to infer that it was from the influence acquired by\r\nthis union that he ultimately abandoned the sovereignty of Mewar and the\r\ntitle of ‘Hindua Suraj’ to become the founder of the ‘one hundred and\r\nthirty tribes of Naushahra [248] Pathans’ of the west. It is fair to\r\nconclude from all these notices regarding the founder of the Guhilot\r\nrace in Chitor that he must have abjured his faith for that of Islam;\r\nand it is probable (though the surmise must ever remain unproved) that,\r\nunder some new title applicable to such change, we may have, in one of\r\nthe early distinguished leaders of ‘the Faith,’ the ancestor of the\r\nGuhilots.\r\n\r\n=Khumān II.=—Let us now proceed to the next irruption of the Islamite\r\ninvaders in the reign of Khuman, from A.D. 812 to 836. Though the leader\r\nof this attack is styled ‘Mahmud Khorasan Pat,’ it is evident from the\r\ncatalogue of Hindu princes who came to defend Chitor that this ‘lord of\r\nKhorasan’ was at least two centuries before the son of Sabuktigin; and\r\nas the period is in perfect accordance with the partition of the\r\ncaliphat by Harun amongst his sons, we can have no hesitation in\r\nassigning such invasion to Mamun, to whose share was allotted Khorasan,\r\nSind, and the Indian dependencies. The records of this period are too\r\nscanty to admit of our passing over in silence even a barren catalogue\r\nof names, which, as texts, with the aid of collateral information, may\r\nprove of some benefit to the future antiquarian and historian.\r\n\r\n\"From Gajni came the Guhilot; the Tak from Asir; from Narlai the\r\nChauhan; the Chalukya from Rahargarh; from Setubandha the Jarkhera; from\r\nMandor the Khairavi; from Mangrol the Makwahana; from Jethgarh the\r\nJoria; from Taragarh the Rewar; the Kachhwaha from Narwar; from Sanchor\r\nthe Kalam; from Junagarh the Dasanoh; from Ajmer the Gaur; from\r\nLohadargarh the Chandano; from Dasaundi the Dor; from Delhi the Tuar;\r\nfrom Patan the Chawara, preserver of royalty (_Rajdhar_); from Jalor the\r\nSonigira; from Sirohi the Deora; from Gagraun the Khichi; the Jadon from\r\nJunagarh; the Jhala from Patri; from Kanauj the Rathor; from Chotiala\r\nthe Bala; from Piramgarh the Gohil; from Jaisalgarh the Bhatti; the Busa\r\nfrom Lahore; the Sankhla from Roneja; the Sehat from Kherligarh; from\r\nMandalgarh the Nikumbha; the Bargujar from Rajor; from Karangarh the\r\nChandel; from Sikar the Sikarwal; from Umargarh the Jethwa; from Pali\r\nthe Bargota; from Khantargarh the Jareja; from Jirga the Kherwar; from\r\nKashmir the Parihara.\"\r\n\r\nOf the Guhilot from Gajni we have said enough; nor shall we comment on\r\nthe Tak, or his capital, Asir, which now belongs to the British\r\nGovernment. The Chauhan, who came from Narlai, was a celebrated branch\r\nof the Ajmer [249] house, and claims the honour of being the parent of\r\nthe Sonigiras of Jalor and the Deoras of Sirohi. Nadol is mentioned by\r\nFerishta as falling a prey to one of Mahmud’s invasions, who destroyed\r\nits ancient temples; but from erroneous punctuation it is lost in the\r\ntranslation as Bazule.[4.4.26] Of Rahargarh and the Jarkhera from\r\nSetubandha (on the Malabar coast) nothing is known.[4.4.27] Of the\r\nKhairavi from Mandor we can only say that it appears to be a branch of\r\nthe Pramaras (who reckoned Mandor one of the nine strongholds,\r\n‘_Nau-kot_,’ under its dominion), established anterior to the Pariharas,\r\nwho at this period had sovereignty in Kashmir. Both the Dor and his\r\ncapital, Dasaundi, are described in ancient books as situated on the\r\nGanges below Kanauj.\r\n\r\nIt is a subject of regret that the annals do not mention the name of the\r\nTuar prince of Delhi, which city could not have been refounded above a\r\ncentury when this call was made upon its aid. Abu-l Fazl, Ferishta,\r\ntheir translators, and those who have followed them have been corrected\r\nby the _Edinburgh Review_, whose critical judgment on this portion of\r\nancient history is eminently good. I possess the original Hindu record\r\nused by Abu-l Fazl, which gives S. 829 for the first Anangpal instead of\r\nS. 429; and as there were but nineteen princes who intervened until his\r\ndynasty was set aside by the Chauhan, it requires no argument to support\r\nthe _four_ instead of _eight_ centuries. The former will give the just\r\naverage of twenty-one years to a reign. The name of Anangpal was titular\r\nin the family, and the epithet was applied to the last as to the first\r\nof the race.\r\n\r\nThe name of the Chawara prince of Patan (Anhilwara) being recorded\r\namongst the auxiliaries of Khuman, is another satisfactory proof of the\r\nantiquity of this invasion; for this dynasty was extinct, and succeeded\r\nby the Solankis, in S. 998 (A.D. 942), fifty years prior to Mahmud of\r\nGhazni, who captured Patan during the reign of Chawand, the second\r\nSolanki prince.[4.4.28]\r\n\r\nThe Sonigira, who came from Jalor, is a celebrated branch of the Chauhan\r\nrace, but we are ignorant of the extent of time that it held this\r\nfortress: and as nothing can invalidate the testimonies afforded by the\r\nnames of the Chawara of [250] Patan, the Kachhwaha of Narwar, the Tuar\r\nof Delhi, and the Rathor from Kanauj, there can be no hesitation at\r\npointing out the anachronisms of the chronicle, which states the Deora\r\nfrom Sirohi, the Khichi from Gagraun, or the Bhatti from Jaisalgarh,\r\namongst the levies on this occasion; and which we must affirm to be\r\ndecided interpolations, the two first being at that period in possession\r\nof the Pramara, and the latter not erected for three centuries later.\r\nThat the Deoras, the Khichis, and the Bhattis came to the aid of Khuman,\r\nwe cannot doubt; but the copyist, ignorant even of the names of the\r\nancient capitals of these tribes, Chhotan, Sindsagar, and Tanot,\r\nsubstituted those which they subsequently founded.\r\n\r\nThe Jadon (Yadu) from Junagarh (Girnar) was of the race of Krishna, and\r\nappeared long to have held possession of this territory; and the names\r\nof the Khengars, of this tribe, will remain as long as the stupendous\r\nmonuments they reared on this sacred hill. Besides the Jadon, we find\r\nSaurashtra sending forth the Jhalas, the Balas, and the Gohils to the\r\naid of the descendant of the lord of Valabhipura, whose paramount\r\nauthority they once all acknowledged, and who appeared to have long\r\nmaintained influence in that distant region.\r\n\r\nOf the tribe of Busa, who left their capital, Lahore, to succour Chitor,\r\nwe have no mention, further than the name being enumerated amongst the\r\nunassigned tribes of Rajputs.[4.4.29] Ferishta frequently notices the\r\nprinces of Lahore in the early progress of Islamism, though he does not\r\ntell us the name of the tribe. In the reign of the caliph Al-Mansur,\r\nA.H. 143 (A.D. 761), the Afghans of Kirman and Peshawar, who, according\r\nto this authority, were a Coptic colony expelled from Egypt,[4.4.30] had\r\nincreased in such numbers as to abandon their residence about the ‘hill\r\nof Sulaiman,’ and crossing the Indus, wrested possessions from the Hindu\r\nprinces of Lahore. This frontier warfare with a tribe which, though it\r\nhad certainly not then embraced the faith of Islam, brought to their\r\nsuccour the forces of the caliph in Zabulistan, so that in five months\r\nseventy battles were fought with varied success; but the last, in which\r\nthe Lahore prince carried his arms to Peshawar,[4.4.31] produced a\r\npeace. Hence arose a union of interests between them and the hill tribe\r\nof Gakkhar, and all the Kohistan west of the Indus was ceded to them\r\n[251] on the condition of guarding this barrier into Hindustan against\r\ninvasion. For this purpose the fortress of Khaibar was erected in the\r\nchief pass of the Koh-i-Daman. For two centuries after this event\r\nFerishta is silent on this frontier warfare, stating that henceforth\r\nHindustan was only accessible through Sind. When Aliptigin first crossed\r\nthe Indus, the prince of Lahore and the Afghans still maintained this\r\nalliance and united to oppose him. Jaipal was then prince of Lahore; and\r\nit is on this event that Ferishta, for the first time, mentions the\r\ntribe of Bhatti,[4.4.32] “at the advice of whose prince he conferred the\r\ncommand of the united forces on an Afghan chief,” to whom he assigned\r\nthe provinces of Multan and Lamghan. From this junction of interests the\r\nprinces of Lahore enjoyed comparative security, until Sabuktigin and\r\nMahmud compelled the Afghans to serve them: then Lahore was captured.\r\nThe territory dependent upon Lahore, at this period, extended from\r\nSirhind to Lamghan, and from Kashmir to Multan. Bhatinda divided with\r\nLahore the residence of its princes. Their first encounter was at\r\nLingham, on which occasion young Mahmud first distinguished himself, and\r\nas the historian says, “the eyes of the heavens were obscured at seeing\r\nhis deeds.”[4.4.33] A tributary engagement was the result, which Jaipal\r\nsoon broke; and being aided by levies from all the princes of Hindustan,\r\nmarched an army of one hundred thousand men against Sabuktigin, and was\r\nagain defeated on the banks of the Indus. He was at length invested and\r\ntaken in Bhatinda by Mahmud, when he put himself to death.[4.4.34] The\r\nsuccessors of Jaipal are mentioned merely as fugitives, and always\r\ndistinct from the princes of Delhi. It is most probable that they were\r\nof the tribe termed Busa in the annals of Mewar, possibly a subdivision\r\nof another; though Ferishta calls the prince of Lahore a Brahman.\r\n\r\nThe Sankhla from Roneja. Both tribe and abode are well known: it is a\r\nsubdivision of the Pramara. Harbuji Sankhla was the Paladin of Marwar,\r\nin which Roneja was situated.\r\n\r\nThe Sehat from Kherligarh was a northern tribe, dwelling about the\r\nIndus, and though entirely unknown to the modern genealogists of India,\r\nis frequently mentioned in the early history of the Bhattis, when their\r\npossessions extended on both sides of the Hyphasis. As intermarriages\r\nbetween the Bhattis and Sehats are [252] often spoken of, it must have\r\nbeen Rajput. It most probably occupied the province of Swat, the Suvat\r\nof D’Anville, a division of the province of Ashthanagar, where dwelt the\r\nAssakenoi of Alexander; concerning which this celebrated geographer\r\nsays, “Il est mention de Suvat comme d’un canton du pays d’Ash-nagar\r\ndans la même géographie turque” (_Ecl._ p. 25). The whole of this ground\r\nwas sacred to the Jadon tribe from the most remote antiquity, from\r\nMultan, the hills of Jud, to Aswinikot (the Tshehin-kote of D’Anville),\r\nwhich, built on the point of confluence of the Choaspes of the Greeks\r\nwith the Indus, marks the spot where dwelt the Assakenoi, corroborated\r\nby the Puranas, which mention the partition of all these territories\r\namongst the sons of Bajaswa, the lord of Kampilnagara, the grand\r\nsubdivision of the Yadu race. In all likelihood the Sehat, who came to\r\nthe aid of Khuman of Chitor, was a branch of these Assakenoi, the\r\nopponents of Alexander.[4.4.35] The modern town of Dinkot appears to\r\noccupy the site of Aswinikot, though D’Anville feels inclined to carry\r\nit into the heart of Bajaur and place it on the rock (_silla_)\r\nAornos.[4.4.36] Such the Sehat; not improbably the Soha, one of the\r\neight subdivisions of the Yadu.[4.4.37] When, in S. 785, the Bhatti\r\nchief Rao Tanu was driven across the Sutlej, the Sehats are mentioned\r\nwith other tribes as forming the army of Husain Shah, with the Barahas,\r\nthe Judis, and Johyas (the Juds and Jinjohyas of Babur), the Butas, and\r\nthe ‘men of Dud.’\r\n\r\nThe Chandel, from Karangarh, occupied the tracts now termed Bundelkhand.\r\n\r\nWe shall pass over the other auxiliary tribes and conclude with the\r\nParihar, who came from Kashmir on this occasion; a circumstance entirely\r\noverlooked in the dissertation on this tribe;[4.4.38] nor does this\r\nisolated fact afford room for further discussion on a race which\r\nexpelled the Pramaras from Mandor.\r\n\r\nSuch aids, who preserved Khuman when assailed by the ‘Khorasan Pat,’\r\nfully demonstrate the antiquity of the annals, which is further attested\r\nby inscriptions. Khuman fought twenty-four great battles, and his name,\r\nlike that of Caesar, became a family distinction. At Udaipur, if you\r\nmake a false step, or even sneeze, you hear the ejaculation of ‘Khuman\r\naid you!’ Khuman, by the advice of the Brahmans, resigned the gaddi to\r\nhis younger son, Jograj; but again resumed [253] it, slaying his\r\nadvisers and execrating the name of Brahman, which he almost\r\nexterminated in his own dominions. Khuman was at length slain by his own\r\nson, Mangal; but the chiefs expelled the parricide, who seized upon\r\nLodorwa in the northern desert, and there established the Mangalia\r\nGuhilots.\r\n\r\n=Bhartribhat III.=—Bhartribhat (familiarly Bhato) succeeded. In his\r\nreign, and in that of his successor, the territory dependent on Chitor\r\nwas greatly increased. All the forest tribes, from the banks of the Mahi\r\nto Abu, were subjugated, and strongholds erected, of which Dharangarh\r\nand Ujargarh still remain to maintain them. He established no less than\r\nthirteen[4.4.39] of his sons in independent possessions in Malwa and\r\nGujarat, and these were distinguished as the Bhatera Guhilots.\r\n\r\nWe shall now leap over fifteen generations; which, though affording a\r\nfew interesting facts to the antiquary, would not amuse the general\r\nreader. We will rest satisfied with stating that the Chauhans of Ajmer\r\nand the Guhilots of Chitor were alternately friends and foes; that\r\nDurlabh Chauhan was slain by Bersi Rawal in a grand battle fought at\r\nKawaria, of which the Chauhan annals state ‘that their princes were now\r\nso powerful as to oppose the chief of Chitor.’ Again, in the next reign,\r\nwe find the renowned Bisaldeo, son of Durlabh, combining with Rawal\r\nTejsi of Chitor to oppose the progress of Islamite invasion: facts\r\nrecorded by inscriptions as well as by the annals. We may close these\r\nremarks on the fifteen princes, from Khuman to Samarsi, with the words\r\nof Gibbon on the dark period of Guelphic annals: “It may be presumed\r\nthat they were illiterate and valiant; that they plundered in their\r\nyouth, and reared churches in their old age; that they were fond of\r\narms, horses, and hunting”; and, we may add, continued bickering with\r\ntheir vassals within when left unemployed by the enemy from without\r\n[254].\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.4.1:\r\n\r\n  [“We now know that Samar Singh was alive up to 1299, only four years\r\n  before Alāu-d-dīn’s siege of Chitor, and that in several inscriptions\r\n  his dates are given as 1273, 1274, 1285, etc.... Instead of being the\r\n  father of Karan Singh I., as stated by Tod, Samar Singh came eight\r\n  generations after him, and was the father of Ratan Singh I., who,\r\n  according to Muhammadan historians, was the ruler of Chitor during the\r\n  reign of Alāu-d-dīn, and the husband of Padmini” (Erskine ii. A. 14\r\n  f.)]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.4.2:\r\n\r\n  See Genealogical Table.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.4.3:\r\n\r\n  This, according to the roll, was the standard of Bappa.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.4.4:\r\n\r\n  Amongst the passages which Dow [i. 37] has slurred over in his\r\n  translation is the interesting account of the origin of the Afghans;\r\n  who, when they first came in contact with those of the new faith, in\r\n  A.H. 62, dwelt around the Koh-i-Sulaiman. Ferishta, quoting authority,\r\n  says: \"The Afghans were Copts, ruled by Pharaun, many of whom were\r\n  converted to the laws and religion of Moses; but others, who were\r\n  stubborn in their worship to their gods, fled towards Hindustan, and\r\n  took possession of the country adjoining the Koh-i-Sulaiman. They were\r\n  visited by Kasim from Sind, and in the 143rd year of the Hegira had\r\n  possessed themselves of the provinces of Kirman, Peshawar, and all\r\n  within their bounds (_sinoran_),\" which Dow has converted into a\r\n  province. The whole geographical description of the Kohistan, the\r\n  etymology of the term _Rohilla_, and other important matter, is\r\n  omitted by him [see Briggs, trans. i. 6 f.].\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.4.5:\r\n\r\n  [The island Diu.] Yūsufgol is stated to have held Chaul on the\r\n  mainland. He was most probably the father of Vanaraja Chawara, the\r\n  founder of Patan Anhilwara, whose ancestors, on the authority of the\r\n  Kumarpal Charitra, were princes of Bandardiva, held by the Portuguese\r\n  since the time of Albuquerque, who changed its name to Deo. [But\r\n  Yūsufgol, if he existed, must have been a Musalmān. Vanarāja Chāwara\r\n  was son of Jayasekhara, said to have been slain in battle, A.D. 696,\r\n  leaving his wife pregnant (_BG_, i. Part i. 150 f.). Yūsufgol does not\r\n  appear in the local history.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.4.6:\r\n\r\n  The ancient roll from which this is taken mentions Asil giving his\r\n  name to a fortress, called Asilgarh. His son, Bijai Pal, was slain in\r\n  attempting to wrest Khambayat (Cambay) from Sangram Dabhi. One of his\r\n  wives, from a violent death, was prematurely delivered of a boy,\r\n  called Setu; and as, in such cases, the Hindu supposes the deceased to\r\n  become a discontented spirit (_churail_), Churaila became the name of\r\n  the tribe. Bija, the twelfth from Asil, obtained Sonal from his\r\n  maternal uncle, Khengar Dabhi, prince of Girnar, but was slain by Jai\r\n  Singh Deo, prince of Surat. From these names compounded, Dabi and\r\n  Churaila, we may have the Dabisalima of Mahmud. [The Asil Guhilots are\r\n  now included in the Mers of the Kāthiawār coast; their numbers are\r\n  exaggerated in the text (_Āīn_, ii. 247; _BG_, ix. Parti. 126).] [See\r\n  p. 266 above.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.4.7:\r\n\r\n  Also called Karna.

The disjointed member flew to\r\n  Mecca, and was recognized as belonging to the saint. An army was\r\n  equipped in the disguise of horse-merchants, which invaded Ajmer,\r\n  whose prince was slain. May we not gather from this incident that an\r\n  insult to the first Islamite missionary, in the person of Roshan Ali,\r\n  brought upon the prince the arms of the Caliph? The same Chauhan\r\n  legends state that Ajaipal was prince of Ajmer at this time; that in\r\n  this invasion by sea he hastened to Anjar (on the coast of Cutch),\r\n  where he held the ‘guard of the ocean’ (_Samudra ki Chauki_), where he\r\n  fell in opposing the landing. An altar was erected on the spot, on\r\n  which was sculptured the figure of the prince on horseback, with his\r\n  lance at rest, and which still annually attracts multitudes at the\r\n  ‘fair (Mela) of Ajaipal.’ The subsequent invasion alluded to in the\r\n  text, of S. 750 (A.D. 694), is marked by a curious anecdote. When the\r\n  ‘Asurs’ had blockaded Ajmer, Lot, the infant son of Manika Rae, was\r\n  playing on the battlements, when an arrow from the foe killed the heir\r\n  of Ajmer, who has ever since been worshipped amongst the lares and\r\n  penates of the Chauhans; and as he had on a silver chain anklet at the\r\n  time, this ornament is forbid to the children of the race. In all\r\n  these Rajput families there is a putra (_adolescens_) amongst the\r\n  penates, always one who has come to an untimely end, and chiefly\r\n  worshipped by females; having a strong resemblance to the rites in\r\n  honour of Adonis. We have traced several Roman and Grecian terms to\r\n  Sanskrit origin; may we add that of _lares_, from _larla_, ‘dear’ or\r\n  ‘beloved’? [?].\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.4.20:\r\n\r\n  [The story is “puerile and fictitious: independent of which the Arabs\r\n  had quite enough to do nearer home” (Elliot-Dowson i. 426).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.4.21:\r\n\r\n  [Persian: not a likely name.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.4.22:\r\n\r\n  Signifying ‘Elephant forests,’ and described in a Hindu map (stamped\r\n  on cloth and painted) of India from Kujliban to Lanka, and the\r\n  provinces west of the Indus to Calcutta; presented by me to the Royal\r\n  Asiatic Society.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.4.23:\r\n\r\n  The list of the vassal princes at the court of the Mori confirms the\r\n  statement of the bard Chand, of the supremacy of Ram Pramara, and the\r\n  partition of his dominion, as described (see p. 63, note) amongst the\r\n  princes who founded separate dynasties at this period; hitherto in\r\n  vassalage or subordinate to the Pramara. We can scarcely suppose the\r\n  family to have suffered any decay since their ancestor, Chandragupta,\r\n  connected by marriage with as well as the ally of the Grecian\r\n  Seleucus, and who held Greeks in his pay. From such connexion, the\r\n  arts of sculpture and architecture may have derived a character\r\n  hitherto unnoticed. Amidst the ruins of Barolli are seen sculptured\r\n  the Grecian helmet; and the elegant ornament, the Kumbha, or ‘vessel\r\n  of desire,’ on the temple of Annapurna (_i.e._ ‘giver of food’), the\r\n  Hindu Ceres, has much affinity to the Grecian device. From the\r\n  inscription (see No. 2) it is evident that Chitor was an appanage of\r\n  Ujjain, the seat of Pramar empire. Its monarch, Chandragupta (Mori\r\n  [Maurya]), degraded into the barber (Maurya) tribe, was the descendant\r\n  of Srenika, prince of Rajagriha, who, according to the Jain work,\r\n  Kalpadruma Kalka, flourished in the year 477 before Vikramaditya, and\r\n  from whom Chandragupta was the thirteenth in descent. The names as\r\n  follows: Kanika, Udsen, and nine in succession of the name of Nanda,\r\n  thence called the Nau-nanda. These, at twenty-two years to a reign\r\n  (see p. 64), would give 286 years, which -477 = 191 s.v. + 56 = 247\r\n  A.C. Now it was in A.C. 260, according to Bayer, that the treaty was\r\n  formed between Seleucus and Chandragupta; so that this scrap of Jain\r\n  history may be regarded as authentic and valuable. Asoka (a name of\r\n  weight in Jain annals) succeeded Chandragupta. He by Kunala, whose son\r\n  was Samprati, with whose name ends the line of Srenika, according to\r\n  the authority from which I made the extract. The name of Samprati is\r\n  well known from Ajmer to Saurashtra, and his era is given in a\r\n  valuable chronogrammatic catalogue in an ancient Jain manuscript from\r\n  the temple of Nadol, at 202 of the Virat Samvat. He is mentioned both\r\n  traditionally and by books as the great supporter of the Jain faith,\r\n  and the remains of temples dedicated to Mahavira, erected by this\r\n  prince, yet exist at Ajmer, on Abu, Kumbhalmer, and Girnar. [Much of\r\n  this needs correction, which cannot be done in the limits of a note.\r\n  For the Nanda dynasty see Smith, _EHI_, 40, and for Chandragupta\r\n  Maurya and Asoka, 115 ff.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.4.24:\r\n\r\n  [This and the second catalogue are fictions.

There is also a Gajni on the estuary of the Mahi, and\r\n  Abu-l Fazl incidentally mentions a Gajnagar as one of the most\r\n  important fortresses of Gujarat, belonging to Ahmad Shah; in\r\n  attempting to obtain which by stratagem, his antagonist, Hoshang, king\r\n  of Malwa, was made prisoner. I am unaware of the site of this place,\r\n  though there are remains of an extensive fortress near the capital,\r\n  founded by Ahmad, and which preserves no name. It may be the ancient\r\n  Gajnagar.

We will now extend the chain to the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n=Samar Singh, Samarsi: The Tuars of Delhi.=—Samarsi was born in S.\r\n1206.[4.5.1] Though the domestic annals are not silent on his acts, we\r\nshall recur chiefly to the bard of Delhi[4.5.2] for his character and\r\nactions, and the history of the period. Before we proceed, however, a\r\nsketch of the political condition of Hindustan during the last of the\r\nTuar sovereigns of Delhi, derived from this authority and in the bard’s\r\nown words, may not be unacceptable. \"In Patan is Bhola Bhim the\r\nChalukya, of iron frame.[4.5.3] On the mountain Abu, Jeth Pramara, in\r\nbattle immovable as the star of the north. In Mewar is Samar Singh, who\r\ntakes tribute from the mighty, a wave of iron in the path of Delhi’s\r\nfoe. In the midst of all, strong in his own strength, Mandor’s prince,\r\nthe arrogant Nahar Rao, the might of Maru, fearing none. In Delhi the\r\nchief of all [255] Ananga, at whose summons attended the princes of\r\nMandor, Nagor, Sind, Jalwat,[4.5.4] and others on its confines,\r\nPeshawar, Lahore, Kangra, and its mountain chiefs, with Kasi,[4.5.5]\r\nPrayag,[4.5.6] and Garh Deogir. The lords of Simar[4.5.7] were in\r\nconstant danger of his power.\" The Bhatti, since their expulsion from\r\nZabulistan, had successively occupied as capitals, Salivahanapur in the\r\nPanjab, Tanot, Derawar, which last they founded, and the ancient\r\nLodorwa, which they conquered in the desert; and at the period in\r\nquestion were constructing their present residence, Jaisalmer. In this\r\nnook they had been fighting for centuries with the lieutenants of the\r\nCaliph at Aror, occasionally redeeming their ancient possessions as far\r\nas the city of the Tak on the Indus. Their situation gave them little\r\npolitical interest in the affairs of Hindustan until the period of\r\nPrithiraj, one of whose principal leaders, Achales, was the brother of\r\nthe Bhatti prince. Anangpal, from this description, was justly entitled\r\nto be termed the paramount sovereign of Hindustan; but he was the last\r\nof a dynasty of nineteen princes, who had occupied Delhi nearly four\r\nhundred years, from the time of the founder Bilan Deo, who, according to\r\na manuscript in the author’s possession, was only an opulent Thakur when\r\nhe assumed the ensigns of royalty in the then deserted Indraprastha,\r\ntaking the name of Anangpal,[4.5.8] ever after titular in the family.\r\nThe Chauhans of Ajmer owed at least homage to Delhi at this time,\r\nalthough Bisaldeo had rendered it almost nominal; and to Someswar, the\r\nfourth in descent, Anangpal was indebted for the preservation of this\r\nsupremacy against the attempts of Kanauj, for which service he obtained\r\nthe Tuar’s daughter in marriage, the issue of which was Prithiraj, who\r\nwhen only eight years of age was proclaimed successor to the Delhi\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\n=Prithiraj.=—Jaichand of Kanauj and Prithiraj bore the same relative\r\nsituation to Anangpal; Bijaipal, the father of the former, as well as\r\nSomeswar, having had a daughter of the Tuar to wife. This originated the\r\nrivalry between the Chauhans and Rathors, which ended in the destruction\r\nof both. When Prithiraj mounted the throne of Delhi, Jaichand not only\r\nrefused to acknowledge his supremacy, but set forth his own claims to\r\nthis distinction. In these he was supported by the prince of Patan [256]\r\nAnhilwara (the eternal foe of the Chauhans), and likewise by the\r\nParihars of Mandor. But the affront given by the latter, in refusing to\r\nfulfil the contract of bestowing his daughter on the young Chauhan,\r\nbrought on a warfare, in which this first essay was but the presage of\r\nhis future fame. Kanauj and Patan had recourse to the dangerous\r\nexpedient of entertaining bands of Tatars, through whom the sovereign of\r\nGhazni was enabled to take advantage of their internal broils.\r\n\r\nSamarsi, prince of Chitor, had married the sister of Prithiraj, and\r\ntheir personal characters, as well as this tie, bound them to each other\r\nthroughout all these commotions, until the last fatal battle on the\r\nGhaggar. From these feuds Hindustan never was free. But unrelenting\r\nenmity was not a part of their character: having displayed the valour of\r\nthe tribe, the bard or Nestor of the day would step in, and a marriage\r\nwould conciliate and maintain in friendship such foes for two\r\ngenerations. From time immemorial such has been the political state of\r\nIndia, as represented by their own epics, or in Arabian or Persian\r\nhistories: thus always the prey of foreigners, and destined to remain\r\nso. Samarsi had to contend both with the princes of Patan and Kanauj;\r\nand although the bard says “he washed his blade in the Jumna,” the\r\ndomestic annals slur over the circumstance of Siddharaja-Jayasingha\r\nhaving actually made a conquest of Chitor; for it is not only included\r\nin the eighteen capitals enumerated as appertaining to this prince, but\r\nthe author discovered a tablet[4.5.9] in Chitor, placed there by his\r\nsuccessor, Kumarpal, bearing the date S. 1206, the period of Samarsi’s\r\nbirth. The first occasion of Samarsi’s aid being called in by the\r\nChauhan emperor was on the discovery of treasure at Nagor, amounting to\r\nseven millions of gold, the deposit of ancient days. The princes of\r\nKanauj and Patan, dreading the influence which such sinews of war would\r\nafford their antagonist, invited Shihabu-d-din to aid their designs of\r\nhumiliating the Chauhan, who in this emergency sent an embassy to\r\nSamarsi. The envoy was Chand Pundir, the vassal chief of Lahore, and\r\nguardian of that frontier. He is conspicuous from this time to the hour\r\n“when he planted his lance at the ford of the Ravi,” and fell in\r\nopposing the passage of Shihabu-d-din. The presents he carries, the\r\nspeech with which he greets the Chitor prince, his reception, reply, and\r\ndismissal are all preserved by [257] Chand. The style of address and the\r\napparel of Samarsi betoken that he had not laid aside the office and\r\nensigns of a ‘Regent of Mahadeva.’ A simple necklace of the seeds of the\r\nlotus adorned his neck; his hair was braided, and he is addressed as\r\nJogindra, or chief of ascetics. Samarsi proceeded to Delhi; and it was\r\narranged, as he was connected by marriage with the prince of Patan, that\r\nPrithiraj should march against this prince, while he should oppose the\r\narmy from Ghazni. He (Samarsi) accordingly fought several indecisive\r\nbattles, which gave time to the Chauhan to terminate the war in Gujarat\r\nand rejoin him. United, they completely discomfited the invaders, making\r\ntheir leader prisoner. Samarsi declined any share of the discovered\r\ntreasure, but permitted his chiefs to accept the gifts offered by\r\nChauhan. Many years elapsed in such subordinate warfare, when the prince\r\nof Chitor was again constrained to use his buckler in defence of Delhi\r\nand its prince, whose arrogance and successful ambition, followed by\r\ndisgraceful inactivity, invited invasion with every presage of success.\r\nJealousy and revenge rendered the princes of Patan, Kanauj, Dhar, and\r\nthe minor courts indifferent spectators of a contest destined to\r\noverthrow them all.\r\n\r\n=The Death of Samar Singh.=—The bard gives a good description of the\r\npreparations for his departure from Chitor, which he was destined never\r\nto see again. The charge of the city was entrusted to a favourite and\r\nyounger son, Karna: which disgusted the elder brother, who went to the\r\nDeccan to Bidar, where he was well received by an Abyssinian\r\nchief,[4.5.10] who had there established himself in sovereignty. Another\r\nson, either on this occasion or on the subsequent fall of Chitor, fled\r\nto the mountains of Nepal, and there spread the Guhilot line.[4.5.11] It\r\nis in this, the last of the books of Chand, termed _The Great Fight_,\r\nthat we have the character of Samarsi fully delineated. His arrival at\r\nDelhi is hailed with songs of joy as a day of deliverance. Prithiraj and\r\nhis court advance seven miles to meet him, and the description of the\r\ngreeting of the king of Delhi and his sister, and the chiefs on either\r\nside who recognize ancient friendships, is most animated. Samarsi reads\r\nhis brother-in-law an indignant lecture on his unprincely inactivity,\r\nand throughout the book divides attention with him.\r\n\r\nIn the planning of the campaign, and march towards the Ghaggar to meet\r\nthe foe [258], Samarsi is consulted, and his opinions are recorded. The\r\nbard represents him as the Ulysses of the host: brave, cool, and skilful\r\nin the fight; prudent, wise, and eloquent in council; pious and decorous\r\non all occasions; beloved by his own chiefs, and reverenced by the\r\nvassals of the Chauhan. In the line of march no augur or bard could\r\nbetter explain the omens, none in the field better dress the squadrons\r\nfor battle, none guide his steed or use his lance with more address. His\r\ntent is the principal resort of the leaders after the march or in the\r\nintervals of battle, who were delighted by his eloquence or instructed\r\nby his knowledge. The bard confesses that his precepts of government are\r\nchiefly from the lips of Khuman;[4.5.12] and of his best episodes and\r\nallegories, whether on morals, rules for the guidance of ambassadors,\r\nchoice of ministers, religious or social duties (but especially those of\r\nthe Rajput to the sovereign), the wise prince of Chitor is the general\r\norgan.\r\n\r\nOn the last of three days’ desperate fighting Samarsi was slain,\r\ntogether with his son Kalyan, and thirteen thousand of his household\r\ntroops and most renowned chieftains.[4.5.13] His beloved Pirtha, on\r\nhearing the fatal issue, her husband slain, her brother captive, the\r\nheroes of Delhi and Chitor “asleep on the banks of the Ghaggar, in the\r\nwave of the steel,” joined her lord through the flame, nor waited the\r\nadvance of the Tatar king, when Delhi was carried by storm, and the last\r\nstay of the Chauhans, Prince Rainsi, met death in the assault. The\r\ncapture of Delhi and its monarch, the death of his ally of Chitor, with\r\nthe bravest and best of their troops, speedily ensured the further and\r\nfinal success of the Tatar arms; and when Kanauj fell, and the traitor\r\nto his nation met his fate in the waves of the Ganges, none were left to\r\ncontend with Shihabu-d-din the possession of the regal seat of the\r\nChauhan. Scenes of devastation, plunder, and massacre commenced, which\r\nlasted through ages; during which nearly all that was sacred in religion\r\nor celebrated in art was destroyed by these ruthless and barbarous\r\ninvaders. The noble Rajput, with a spirit of constancy and enduring\r\ncourage, seized every opportunity to turn upon his oppressor. By his\r\nperseverance and valour he wore out entire dynasties of foes,\r\nalternately yielding ‘to his fate,’ or restricting the circle of\r\nconquest. Every road in Rajasthan was moistened with torrents of blood\r\nof the [259] spoiled and the spoiler. But all was of no avail; fresh\r\nsupplies were ever pouring in, and dynasty succeeded dynasty, heir to\r\nthe same remorseless feeling which sanctified murder, legalized\r\nspoliation, and deified destruction. In these desperate conflicts entire\r\ntribes were swept away whose names are the only memento of their former\r\nexistence and celebrity.\r\n\r\n=Gallant Resistance of the Rājputs.=—What nation on earth would have\r\nmaintained the semblance of civilization, the spirit or the customs of\r\ntheir forefathers, during so many centuries of overwhelming depression\r\nbut one of such singular character as the Rajput? Though ardent and\r\nreckless, he can, when required, subside into forbearance and apparent\r\napathy, and reserve himself for the opportunity of revenge. Rajasthan\r\nexhibits the sole example in the history of mankind of a people\r\nwithstanding every outrage barbarity can inflict, or human nature\r\nsustain, from a foe whose religion commands annihilation, and bent to\r\nthe earth, yet rising buoyant from the pressure, and making calamity a\r\nwhetstone to courage. How did the Britons at once sink under the Romans,\r\nand in vain strive to save their groves, their druids, or the altars of\r\nBal from destruction! To the Saxons they alike succumbed; they, again,\r\nto the Danes; and this heterogeneous breed to the Normans. Empire was\r\nlost and gained by a single battle, and the laws and religion of the\r\nconquered merged in those of the conquerors. Contrast with these the\r\nRajputs; not an iota of their religion or customs have they lost, though\r\nmany a foot of land. Some of their States have been expunged from the\r\nmap of dominion; and, as a punishment of national infidelity, the pride\r\nof the Rathor, and the glory of the Chalukya, the overgrown Kanauj and\r\ngorgeous Anhilwara, are forgotten names! Mewar alone, the sacred bulwark\r\nof religion, never compromised her honour for her safety, and still\r\nsurvives her ancient limits; and since the brave Samarsi gave up his\r\nlife, the blood of her princes has flowed in copious streams for the\r\nmaintenance of this honour, religion, and independence.\r\n\r\n=Karan Singh I.: Ratan Singh.=—Samarsi had several sons;[4.5.14] but\r\nKarna was his heir, and during his minority his mother, Kuramdevi, a\r\nprincess of Patan, nobly maintained what his father left. She headed her\r\nRajputs and gave battle[4.5.15] in person to Kutbu-d-din, near [260]\r\nAmber, when the viceroy was defeated and wounded. Nine Rajas, and eleven\r\nchiefs of inferior dignity with the title of Rawat, followed the mother\r\nof their prince.\r\n\r\nKarna (the radiant) succeeded in S. 1249 (A.D. 1193); but he was not\r\ndestined to be the founder of a line in Mewar.[4.5.16] The annals are at\r\nvariance with each other on an event which gave the sovereignty of\r\nChitor to a younger branch, and sent the elder into the inhospitable\r\nwilds of the west, to found a city[4.5.17] and perpetuate a\r\nline.[4.5.18] It is stated generally that Karna had two sons, Mahup and\r\nRahup; but this is an error: Samarsi and Surajmall were brothers: Karna\r\nwas the son of the former and Mahup was his son, whose mother was a\r\nChauhan of Bagar. Surajmall had a son named Bharat, who was driven from\r\nChitor by a conspiracy. He proceeded to Sind, obtained Aror from its\r\nprince, a Musalman, and married the daughter of the Bhatti chief of\r\nPugal, by whom he had a son named Rahup. Kama died of grief for the loss\r\nof Bharat and the unworthiness of Mahup, who abandoned him to live\r\nentirely with his maternal relations, the Chauhans.\r\n\r\nThe Sonigira chief of Jalor had married the daughter of Karna, by whom\r\nhe had a child named Randhol,[4.5.19] whom by treachery he placed on the\r\nthrone of Chitor, slaying the chief Guhilots. Mahup being unable to\r\nrecover his rights, and unwilling to make any exertion, the chair of\r\nBappa Rawal would have passed to the Chauhans but for an ancient bard of\r\nthe house. He pursued his way to Aror, held by old Bharat as a fief of\r\nKabul. With the levies of Sind he marched to claim the right abandoned\r\nby Mahup and at Pali encountered and defeated the Sonigiras. The\r\nretainers of Mewar flocked to his standard, and by their aid he\r\nenthroned himself in Chitor. He sent for his father and mother,\r\nRanangdevi, whose dwelling on the Indus was made over to a younger\r\nbrother, who bartered his faith for Aror, and held it as a vassal of\r\nKabul.\r\n\r\n=Rāhup.=—Rahup obtained Chitor in S. 1257 (A.D. 1201), and shortly after\r\nsustained the attack of Shamsu-d-din, whom he met and overcame in a\r\nbattle at Nagor. Two [261] great changes were introduced by this prince;\r\nthe first in the title of the tribe, to Sesodia; the other in that of\r\nits prince, from Rawal to Rana. The puerile reason for the former has\r\nalready been noticed;[4.5.20] the cause of the latter is deserving of\r\nmore attention. Amongst the foes of Rahup was the Parihar prince of\r\nMandor: his name Mokal, with the title of Rana. Rahup seized him in his\r\ncapital and brought him to Sesoda, making him renounce the rich district\r\nof Godwar and his title of Rana, which he assumed himself, to denote the\r\ncompletion of his feud. He ruled thirty-eight years in a period of great\r\ndistraction, and appears to have been well calculated, not only to\r\nuphold the fallen fortunes of the State, but to rescue them from utter\r\nruin. His reign is the more remarkable by contrast with his successors,\r\nnine of whom are ‘pushed from their stools’ in the same or even a\r\nshorter period than that during which he upheld the dignity.\r\n\r\nFrom Rahup to Lakhamsi [Lakshman Singh], in the short space of half a\r\ncentury, nine princes of Chitor were crowned, and at nearly equal\r\nintervals of time followed each other to ‘the mansions of the sun.’ Of\r\nthese nine, six fell in battle. Nor did they meet their fate at home,\r\nbut in a chivalrous enterprise to redeem the sacred Gaya from the\r\npollution of the barbarian. For this object these princes successively\r\nfell, but such devotion inspired fear, if not pity or conviction, and\r\nthe bigot renounced the impiety which Prithimall purchased with his\r\nblood, and until Alau-d-din’s reign, this outrage to their prejudices\r\nwas renounced. But in this interval they had lost their capital, for it\r\nis stated as the only occurrence in Bhonsi’s[4.5.21] reign that he [262]\r\n“recovered Chitor” and made the name of Rana be acknowledged by all. Two\r\nmemorials are preserved of the nine princes from Rahup to Lakhamsi, and\r\nof the same character: confusion and strife within and without. We will,\r\ntherefore, pass over these to another grand event in the vicissitudes of\r\nthis house, which possesses more of romance than of history, though the\r\nfacts are undoubted.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.5.1:\r\n\r\n  [For the error in his date see p. 281 above.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.5.2:\r\n\r\n  The work of Chand is a universal history of the period in which he\r\n  wrote. In the sixty-nine books, comprising one hundred thousand\r\n  stanzas, relating to the exploits of Prithiraj, every noble family of\r\n  Rajasthan will find some record of their ancestors. It is accordingly\r\n  treasured amongst the archives of each race having any pretensions to\r\n  the name of Rajput. From this he can trace his martial forefathers who\r\n  ‘drank of the wave of battle’ in the passes of Kirman when the ‘cloud\r\n  of war rolled from Himachal’ to the plains of Hindustan. The wars of\r\n  Prithiraj, his alliances, his numerous and powerful tributaries, their\r\n  abodes and pedigrees, make the works of Chand invaluable as historic\r\n  and geographical memoranda, besides being treasures in mythology,\r\n  manners, and the annals of the mind. To read this poet well is a sure\r\n  road to honour, and my own Guru was allowed, even by the professional\r\n  bards, to excel therein. As he read I rapidly translated about thirty\r\n  thousand stanzas. Familiar with the dialects in which it is written, I\r\n  have fancied that I seized occasionally the poet’s spirit; but it were\r\n  presumption to suppose that I embodied all his brilliancy, or fully\r\n  comprehended the depth of his allusions. But I knew for whom he wrote.\r\n  The most familiar of his images and sentiments I heard daily from the\r\n  mouths of those around me, the descendants of the men whose deeds he\r\n  rehearses. I was enabled thus to seize his meaning, where one more\r\n  skilled in poetic lore might have failed, and to make my prosaic\r\n  version of some value.

In the\r\n  first, or Rāwal, branch were Khem or Kshem Singh, the eldest son of\r\n  Karan Singh, Sāmant Singh, Kumār Singh, Mathan Singh, Padam Singh,\r\n  Jeth Singh, Tej Singh, Samar Singh, and Ratan Singh, all of whom\r\n  reigned at Chitor; while in the Rāna branch were Rāhup, a younger son\r\n  of Karan Singh, Narpat, Dinkaran, Jaskaran, Nāgpāl, Puranpāl, Prithi\r\n  Pāl, Bhuvān Singh, Bhīm Singh, Jai Singh, and Lakshman Singh, who\r\n  ruled at Sesoda, and called themselves Sesodias. Thus, instead of\r\n  having to fit in something like ten generations between Samar Singh,\r\n  who, as we know, was alive in 1299, and the siege of Chitor, which\r\n  certainly took place in 1303, we find that those ten princes were not\r\n  descendants of Samar Singh at all, but the contemporaries of his seven\r\n  immediate predecessors on the _gaddi_ of Chitor and of himself, and\r\n  that both Ratan Singh, the son of Samar Singh, and Lakshman Singh, the\r\n  contemporary of Ratan Singh, were descended from a common ancestor,\r\n  Karan Singh I., nine and eleven generations back respectively. It is\r\n  also possible to reconcile the statement of the Musalmān historians\r\n  that Ratan Singh (called Rāī Ratan) was ruler of Chitor during the\r\n  siege—a statement corroborated by an inscription at Rājnagar—with the\r\n  generally accepted story that it was Rāna Lakshman Singh who fell in\r\n  defence of the fort\" (Erskine ii. A. 15).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.5.19:\r\n\r\n  So pronounced, but properly written Randhaval, ‘the standard of the\r\n  field.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.5.20:\r\n\r\n  See note, p. 252.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.5.21:\r\n\r\n  His second son, Chandra, obtained an appanage on the Chambal, and his\r\n  issue, well known as Chandarawats, constituted one of the most\r\n  powerful vassal clans of Mewar. Rampura (Bhanpura) was their\r\n  residence, yielding a revenue of nine lakhs (£110,000), held on the\r\n  tenure of service which, from an original grant in my possession from\r\n  Rana Jagat Singh to his nephew Madho Singh, afterwards prince of\r\n  Amber, was three thousand horse and foot (see p. 235), and the fine of\r\n  investiture was seventy-five thousand rupees. Madho Singh, when prince\r\n  of Amber, did what was invalid as well as ungrateful; he made over\r\n  this domain, granted during his misfortunes, to Holkar, the first limb\r\n  lopped off Mewar. The Chandarawat proprietor continued, however, to\r\n  possess a portion of the original estate with the fortress of Amad,\r\n  which it maintained throughout all the troubles of Rajwara till A.D.\r\n  1821. It shows the attachment to custom that the young Rao applied and\r\n  received ‘the sword’ of investiture from his old lord paramount, the\r\n  Rana, though dependent on Holkar’s forbearance. But a minority is\r\n  proverbially dangerous in India. Disorder from party plots made Amad\r\n  troublesome to Holkar’s government, which as his ally and preserver of\r\n  tranquillity we suppressed by blowing up the walls of the fortress.\r\n  This is one of many instances of the harsh, uncompromising nature of\r\n  our power, and the anomalous description of our alliances with the\r\n  Rajputs. However necessary to repress the disorder arising from the\r\n  claims of ancient proprietors and the recent rights of Holkar, or the\r\n  new proprietor, Ghafur Khan, yet surrounding princes, and the general\r\n  population, who know the history of past times, lament to see a name\r\n  of five hundred years’ duration thus summarily extinguished, which\r\n  chiefly benefits an upstart Pathan. Such the vortex of the ambiguous,\r\n  irregular, and unsystematic policy, which marks many of our alliances,\r\n  which protect too often but to injure, and gives to our office of\r\n  general arbitrator and high constable of Rajasthan a harsh and\r\n  unfeeling character. Much of this arises from ignorance of the past\r\n  history; much from disregard of the peculiar usages of the people; or\r\n  from that expediency which too often comes in contact with moral\r\n  fitness, which will go on until the day predicted by the Nestor of\r\n  India, when “_one sikka_ (seal) alone will be used in Hindustan.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 6\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lakhamsi: Lachhman Singh.=—Lakhamsi[4.6.1] succeeded his father in S.\r\n1331 (A.D. 1275), a memorable era in the annals, when Chitor, the\r\nrepository of all that was precious yet untouched of the arts of India,\r\nwas stormed, sacked, and treated with remorseless barbarity by the\r\nPathan [Khilji] emperor, Alau-d-din. Twice it was attacked by this\r\nsubjugator of India. In the first siege it escaped spoliation, though at\r\nthe price of its best defenders: that which followed is the first\r\nsuccessful assault and capture of which we have any detailed account.\r\n\r\n=Bhīm Singh: Padmini.=—Bhimsi was the uncle of the young prince, and\r\nprotector during his minority. He had espoused the daughter of Hamir\r\nSank (Chauhan) of Ceylon, the cause of woes unnumbered to the Sesodias.\r\nHer name was Padmini,[4.6.2] a title bestowed only on the superlatively\r\nfair, and transmitted with renown to posterity by tradition and the song\r\nof the bard. Her beauty, accomplishments, exaltation, and destruction,\r\nwith other incidental circumstances, constitute the subject of one of\r\nthe most popular traditions of Rajwara. The Hindu bard recognizes the\r\nfair, in preference to fame and love of conquest, as the motive for the\r\nattack of Alau-d-din, who [263] limited his demand to the possession of\r\nPadmini; though this was after a long and fruitless siege. At length he\r\nrestricted his desire to a mere sight of this extraordinary beauty, and\r\nacceded to the proposal of beholding her through the medium of mirrors.\r\nRelying on the faith of the Rajput, he entered Chitor slightly guarded,\r\nand having gratified his wish, returned. The Rajput, unwilling to be\r\noutdone in confidence, accompanied the king to the foot of the fortress,\r\namidst many complimentary excuses from his guest at the trouble he thus\r\noccasioned. It was for this that Ala risked his own safety, relying on\r\nthe superior faith of the Hindu. Here he had an ambush; Bhimsi was made\r\nprisoner, hurried away to the Tatar camp, and his liberty made dependent\r\non the surrender of Padmini.\r\n\r\n=The Siege of Chitor.=—Despair reigned in Chitor when this fatal event\r\nwas known, and it was debated whether Padmini should be resigned as a\r\nransom for their defender. Of this she was informed, and expressed her\r\nacquiescence. Having provided wherewithal to secure her from dishonour,\r\nshe communed with two chiefs of her own kin and clan of Ceylon, her\r\nuncle Gora, and his nephew Badal, who devised a scheme for the\r\nliberation of their prince without hazarding her life or fame.\r\nIntimation was dispatched to Ala that on the day he withdrew from his\r\ntrenches the fair Padmini would be sent, but in a manner befitting her\r\nown and his high station, surrounded by her females and handmaids; not\r\nonly those who would accompany her to Delhi, but many others who desired\r\nto pay her this last mark of reverence. Strict commands were to be\r\nissued to prevent curiosity from violating the sanctity of female\r\ndecorum and privacy. No less than seven hundred covered litters\r\nproceeded to the royal camp. In each was placed one of the bravest of\r\nthe defenders of Chitor, borne by six armed soldiers disguised as\r\nlitter-porters. They reached the camp. The royal tents were enclosed\r\nwith _kanats_ (walls of cloth); the litters were deposited, and half an\r\nhour was granted for a parting interview between the Hindu prince and\r\nhis bride. They then placed their prince in a litter and returned with\r\nhim, while the greater number (the supposed damsels) remained to\r\naccompany the fair to Delhi.[4.6.3] But Ala had no intention to permit\r\nBhimsi’s return, and was becoming jealous of the long interview he\r\nenjoyed, when, instead of the prince and Padmini, the devoted band\r\nissued from their litters: but Ala was too well guarded. Pursuit was\r\nordered, while these covered the retreat till they perished to a man. A\r\nfleet horse was in reserve for [264] Bhimsi, on which he was placed, and\r\nin safety ascended the fort, at whose outer gate the host of Ala was\r\nencountered. The choicest of the heroes of Chitor met the assault. With\r\nGora and Badal at their head, animated by the noblest sentiments, the\r\ndeliverance of their chief and the honour of their queen, they devoted\r\nthemselves to destruction, and few were the survivors of this slaughter\r\nof the flower of Mewar. For a time Ala was defeated in his object, and\r\nthe havoc they had made in his ranks, joined to the dread of their\r\ndetermined resistance, obliged him to desist from the enterprise.\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of the adjuration,“by the sin of the sack\r\nof Chitor.” Of these sacks they enumerate _three and a half_. This is\r\nthe ‘half’; for though the city was not stormed, the best and bravest\r\nwere cut off (_sakha_). It is described with great animation in the\r\nKhuman Raesa. Badal was but a stripling of twelve, but the Rajput\r\nexpects wonders from this early age. He escaped, though wounded, and a\r\ndialogue ensues between him and his uncle’s wife, who desires him to\r\nrelate how her lord conducted himself ere she joins him. The stripling\r\nreplies: “He was the reaper of the harvest of battle; I followed his\r\nsteps as the humble gleaner of his sword. On the gory bed of honour he\r\nspread a carpet of the slain; a barbarian prince his pillow, he laid him\r\ndown, and sleeps surrounded by the foe.” Again she said: \"Tell me,\r\nBadal, how did my love (_piyar_) behave?\" “Oh! mother, how further\r\ndescribe his deeds when he left no foe to dread or admire him?” She\r\nsmiled farewell to the boy, and adding, “My lord will chide my delay,”\r\nsprung into the flame.\r\n\r\nAlau-d-din, having recruited his strength, returned to his object,\r\nChitor. The annals state this to have been in S. 1346 (A.D. 1290), but\r\nFerishta gives a date thirteen years later.[4.6.4] They had not yet\r\nrecovered the loss of so many valiant men who had sacrificed themselves\r\nfor their prince’s safety, and Ala carried on his attacks more closely,\r\nand at length obtained the hill at the southern point, where he\r\nentrenched himself. They still pretend to point out his trenches; but so\r\nmany have been formed by subsequent attacks that we cannot credit the\r\nassertion. The poet has found in the disastrous issue of this siege\r\nadmirable materials for his song. He represents the Rana, after an\r\narduous day, stretched on his pallet, and during a night of watchful\r\nanxiety, pondering on the means by which he might preserve from the\r\ngeneral destruction one at least of his twelve sons; when a voice [265]\r\nbroke on his solitude, exclaiming, “_Main bhukhi ho_”;[4.6.5] and\r\nraising his eyes, he saw, by the dim glare of the chiragh,[4.6.6]\r\nadvancing between the granite columns, the majestic form of the guardian\r\ngoddess of Chitor. “Not satiated,” exclaimed the Rana, “though eight\r\nthousand of my kin were late an offering to thee?” “I must have regal\r\nvictims; and if twelve who wear the diadem bleed not for Chitor, the\r\nland will pass from the line.” This said, she vanished.\r\n\r\nOn the morn he convened a council of his chiefs, to whom he revealed the\r\nvision of the night, which they treated as the dream of a disordered\r\nfancy. He commanded their attendance at midnight; when again the form\r\nappeared, and repeated the terms on which alone she would remain amongst\r\nthem. “Though thousands of barbarians strew the earth, what are they to\r\nme? On each day enthrone a prince. Let the kirania,[4.6.7] the chhatra\r\nand the chamara,[4.6.7] proclaim his sovereignty, and for three days let\r\nhis decrees be supreme: on the fourth let him meet the foe and his fate.\r\nThen only may I remain.”\r\n\r\nWhether we have merely the fiction of the poet, or whether the scene was\r\ngot up to animate the spirit of resistance, matters but little, it is\r\nconsistent with the belief of the tribe; and that the goddess should\r\nopenly manifest her wish to retain as her tiara the battlements of\r\nChitor on conditions so congenial to the warlike and superstitious\r\nRajput was a gage readily taken up and fully answering the end. A\r\ngenerous contention arose amongst the brave brothers who should be the\r\nfirst victim to avert the denunciation. Arsi urged his priority of\r\nbirth: he was proclaimed, the umbrella waved over his head, and on the\r\nfourth day he surrendered his short-lived honours and his life. Ajaisi,\r\nthe next in birth, demanded to follow; but he was the favourite son of\r\nhis father, and at his request he consented to let his brothers precede\r\nhim. Eleven had fallen in turn, and but one victim remained to the\r\nsalvation of the city, when the Rana, calling his chiefs around him,\r\nsaid, “Now I devote myself for Chitor.”\r\n\r\n=The Johar.=—But another awful sacrifice was to precede this act of\r\nself-devotion in that horrible rite, the _Johar_,[4.6.8] where the\r\nfemales are immolated to preserve them from pollution or captivity. The\r\nfuneral pyre was lighted within the ‘great subterranean retreat,’[4.6.9]\r\nin chambers impervious to the light [266] of day, and the defenders of\r\nChitor beheld in procession the queens, their own wives and daughters,\r\nto the number of several thousands. The fair Padmini closed the throng,\r\nwhich was augmented by whatever of female beauty or youth could be\r\ntainted by Tatar lust. They were conveyed to the cavern, and the opening\r\nclosed upon them, leaving them to find security from dishonour in the\r\ndevouring element.\r\n\r\nA contest now arose between the Rana and his surviving son; but the\r\nfather prevailed, and Ajaisi, in obedience to his commands, with a small\r\nband passed through the enemy’s lines, and reached Kelwara in safety.\r\nThe Rana, satisfied that his line was not extinct, now prepared to\r\nfollow his brave sons; and calling around him his devoted clans, for\r\nwhom life had no longer any charms, they threw open the portals and\r\ndescended to the plains, and with a reckless despair carried death, or\r\nmet it, in the crowded ranks of Ala. The Tatar conqueror took possession\r\nof an inanimate capital, strewed with brave defenders, the smoke yet\r\nissuing from the recesses where lay consumed the once fair object of his\r\ndesire; and since this devoted day the cavern has been sacred: no eye\r\nhas penetrated its gloom, and superstition has placed as its guardian a\r\nhuge serpent, whose ‘venomous breath’ extinguishes the light which might\r\nguide intruders to ‘the place of sacrifice.’\r\n\r\n=The Conquests of Alāu-d-dīn.=—Thus fell, in A.D. 1303, this celebrated\r\ncapital, in the round of conquest of Alau-d-din, one of the most\r\nvigorous and warlike sovereigns who have occupied the throne of India.\r\nIn success, and in one of the means of attainment, a bigoted hypocrisy,\r\nhe bore a striking resemblance to Aurangzeb; and the title of\r\n‘Sikandaru-s-Sani,’ or the second Alexander, which he assumed and\r\nimpressed on his coins, was no idle vaunt. The proud Anhilwara, the\r\nancient Dhar and Avanti, Mandor and Deogir, the seats of the Solankis,\r\nthe Pramaras, the Pariharas and Taks, the entire Agnikula race, were\r\noverturned for ever by Ala. Jaisalmer, Gagraun, Bundi, the abodes of the\r\nBhatti, the Khichi, and the Hara, with many of minor importance,\r\nsuffered all the horrors of assault from this foe of the race, though\r\ndestined again to raise their heads. The Rathors of Marwar and the [267]\r\nKachhwahas of Amber were yet in a state of insignificance: the former\r\nwere slowly creeping into notice as the vassals of the Pariharas, while\r\nthe latter could scarcely withstand the attacks of the original Mina\r\npopulation. Ala remained in Chitor some days, admiring the grandeur of\r\nhis conquest; and having committed every act of barbarity and wanton\r\ndilapidation which a bigoted zeal could suggest, overthrowing the\r\ntemples and other monuments of art, he delivered the city in charge to\r\nMaldeo, the chief of Jalor, whom he had conquered and enrolled amongst\r\nhis vassals. The palace of Bhim and the fair Padmini alone appears to\r\nhave escaped the wrath of Ala; it would be pleasing could we suppose any\r\nkinder sentiment suggested the exception, which enables the author of\r\nthese annals to exhibit the abode of the fair of Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PALACE OF RĀNA BHĪM AND PADMINI.\r\n  _To face page 312._\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The Flight of Rāna Ajai Singh.=—The survivor of Chitor, Rana Ajaisi,\r\nwas now in security at Kelwara, a town situated in the heart of the\r\nAravalli mountains, the western boundary of Mewar, to which its princes\r\nhad been indebted for twelve centuries of dominion. Kelwara is at the\r\nhighest part of one of its most extensive valleys, termed the Shero\r\nNala, the richest district of this Alpine region. Guarded by faithful\r\nadherents, Ajaisi cherished for future occasion the wrecks of Mewar. It\r\nwas the last behest of his father that when he attained ‘one hundred\r\nyears’ (a figurative expression for dying) the son of Arsi, the elder\r\nbrother, should succeed him. This injunction, from the deficiency of the\r\nqualities requisite at such a juncture in his own sons, met a ready\r\ncompliance. Hamir was this son, destined to redeem the promise of the\r\ngenius of Chitor and the lost honours of his race, and whose birth and\r\nearly history fill many a page of their annals. His father, Arsi, being\r\nout on a hunting excursion in the forest of Ondua, with some young\r\nchiefs of the court, in pursuit of the boar entered a field of maize,\r\nwhen a female offered to drive out the game. Pulling one of the stalks\r\nof maize, which grows to the height of ten or twelve feet, she pointed\r\nit, and mounting the platform made to watch the corn, impaled the hog,\r\ndragged him before the hunters, and departed. Though accustomed to feats\r\nof strength and heroism from the nervous arms of their countrywomen, the\r\nact surprised them. They descended to the stream at hand, and prepared\r\nthe repast, as is usual, on the spot. The feast was held, and comments\r\nwere passing on the fair arm which had transfixed the boar, when a ball\r\nof clay from a sling fractured a limb of the prince’s steed. Looking in\r\nthe direction whence it [268] came, they observed the same damsel, from\r\nher elevated stand,[4.6.10] preserving her fields from aerial\r\ndepredators; but seeing the mischief she had occasioned she descended to\r\nexpress her regret and then returned to her pursuit. As they were\r\nproceeding homewards after the sports of the day, they again encountered\r\nthe damsel, with a vessel of milk on her head, and leading in either\r\nhand a young buffalo. It was proposed, in frolic, to overturn her milk,\r\nand one of the companions of the prince dashed rudely by her; but\r\nwithout being disconcerted, she entangled one of her charges with the\r\nhorse’s limbs and brought the rider to the ground. On inquiry the prince\r\ndiscovered that she was the daughter of a poor Rajput of the Chandano\r\ntribe.[4.6.11] He returned the next day to the same quarter and sent for\r\nher father, who came and took his seat with perfect independence close\r\nto the prince, to the merriment of his companions, which was checked by\r\nArsi asking his daughter to wife. They were yet more surprised by the\r\ndemand being refused. The Rajput, on going home, told the more prudent\r\nmother, who scolded him heartily, made him recall the refusal, and seek\r\nthe prince. They were married, and Hamir was the son of the Chandano\r\nRajputni.[4.6.12] He remained little noticed at the maternal abode till\r\nthe catastrophe of Chitor. At this period he was twelve years of age,\r\nand had led a rustic life, from which the necessity of the times\r\nrecalled him.\r\n\r\n=Mewār occupied by the Musalmāns: The Exploit of Hamīr.=—Mewar was now\r\noccupied by the garrisons of Delhi, and Ajaisi had besides to contend\r\nwith the mountain chiefs, amongst whom Munja Balaicha was the most\r\nformidable, who had, on a recent occasion, invaded the Shero Nala, and\r\npersonally encountered the Rana, whom he wounded on the head with a\r\nlance. The Rana’s sons, Sajansi and Ajamsi, though fourteen and fifteen,\r\nan age at which a Rajput ought to indicate his future character, proved\r\nof little aid in the emergency. Hamir was summoned, and accepted the\r\nfeud against Munja, promising to return successful or not at all. In a\r\nfew days he was seen entering the pass of Kelwara with Munja’s head at\r\nhis saddle-bow. Modestly placing the trophy at his uncle’s feet, he\r\nexclaimed: “Recognize the head of your foe!” Ajaisi ‘kissed his\r\nbeard,’[4.6.13] and observing that fate had stamped empire on his\r\nforehead, impressed [269] it with a tika of blood from the head of the\r\nBalaicha. This decided the fate of the sons of Ajaisi; one of whom died\r\nat Kelwara, and the other, Sajansi, who might have excited a civil war,\r\nwas sent from the country.[4.6.14] He departed for the Deccan, where his\r\nissue was destined to avenge some of the wrongs the parent country had\r\nsustained, and eventually to overturn the monarchy of Hindustan; for\r\nSajansi was the ancestor of Sivaji, the founder of the Satara throne,\r\nwhose lineage[4.6.15] is given in the chronicles of Mewar.\r\n\r\n=Rāna Hamīr Singh, A.D. 1301-64.=—Hamir succeeded in S. 1357 (A.D.\r\n1301), and had sixty-four years granted to him to redeem his country\r\nfrom the ruins of the past century, which period had elapsed since India\r\nceased to own the paramount sway of her native princes. The day on which\r\nhe assumed the ensigns of rule he gave, in the _tika daur_, an earnest\r\nof his future energy, which he signalized by a rapid inroad into the\r\nheart of the country of the predatory Balaicha, and captured their\r\nstronghold Pusalia. We may here explain the nature of this custom of a\r\nbarbaric chivalry.\r\n\r\n=The Inaugural Foray.=—The tika daur signifies the foray of\r\ninauguration, which obtained from time immemorial on such events, and is\r\nyet maintained where any semblance of hostility will allow its\r\nexecution. On the morning of installation, having previously received\r\nthe tika of sovereignty, the prince at the head of his retainers makes a\r\nforay into the territory of any one with whom he may have a feud, or\r\nwith whom he may be indifferent as to exciting one; he captures a\r\nstronghold or plunders a town, and returns with the trophies. If amity\r\nshould prevail with all around, which the prince cares not to disturb,\r\nthey have still a mock representation of the custom. For many reigns\r\nafter the Jaipur princes united their fortunes to the throne of Delhi\r\ntheir frontier town, Malpura, was the object of the tika daur of the\r\nprinces of Mewar.\r\n\r\n=Chitor under a Musalmān Garrison.=—“When Ajmall[4.6.16] went another\r\nroad,” as the bard figuratively describes the demise of Rana Ajaisi,\r\n“the son of Arsi unsheathed the sword, thence never stranger to his\r\nhand.” Maldeo remained with the royal garrison at Chitor,[4.6.17] but\r\nHamir [270] desolated their plains, and left to his enemies only the\r\nfortified towns which could safely be inhabited. He commanded all who\r\nowned his sovereignty either to quit their abodes, and retire with their\r\nfamilies to the shelter of the hills on the eastern and western\r\nfrontiers, or share the fate of the public enemy. The roads were\r\nrendered impassable from his parties, who issued from their retreats in\r\nthe Aravalli, the security of which baffled pursuit. This destructive\r\npolicy of laying waste the resources of their own country, and from this\r\nasylum attacking their foes as opportunity offered, has obtained from\r\nthe time of Mahmud of Ghazni in the tenth, to Muhammad, the last who\r\nmerited the name of Emperor of Delhi, in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n=Resistance of Hamīr Singh.=—Hamir made Kelwara[4.6.18] his residence,\r\nwhich soon became the chief retreat of the emigrants from the plains.\r\nThe situation was admirably chosen, being covered by several ranges,\r\nguarded by intricate defiles, and situated at the foot of a pass leading\r\nover the mountain into a still more inaccessible retreat (where\r\nKumbhalmer now stands),[4.6.19] well watered and wooded, with abundance\r\nof pastures and excellent indigenous fruits and roots. This tract, above\r\nfifty miles in breadth, is twelve hundred feet above the level of the\r\nplains and three thousand above the sea, with a considerable quantity of\r\narable land, and free communication to obtain supplies by the passes of\r\nthe western declivity from Marwar, Gujarat, or the friendly Bhils, of\r\nthe west, to whom this house owes a large debt of gratitude. On various\r\noccasions the communities of Oghna and Panarwa furnished the princes of\r\nMewar with five thousand bowmen, supplied them with provisions, or\r\nguarded the safety of their families when they had to oppose the foe in\r\nthe field. The elevated plateau of the eastern frontier presented in its\r\nforests and dells many places of security; but Ala[4.6.20] traversed\r\nthese in person, destroying as he went: neither did they possess the\r\nadvantages of climate and natural productions arising from the elevation\r\nof the other. Such was the state of Mewar: its places of strength\r\noccupied by the foe, cultivation and peaceful objects neglected from the\r\npersevering hostility of Hamir, when a proposal of marriage came from\r\nthe Hindu governor of Chitor, which was immediately accepted, contrary\r\nto the [271] wishes of the prince’s advisers.\r\n\r\n=The Recovery of Chitor.=—Whether this was intended as a snare to entrap\r\nhim, or merely as an insult, every danger was scouted by Hamir which\r\ngave a chance to the recovery of Chitor. He desired that ‘_the\r\ncoco-nut_[4.6.21] _might be retained_’ coolly remarking on the dangers\r\npointed out, \"My feet shall at least tread in the rocky steps in which\r\nmy ancestors have moved. A Rajput should always be prepared for\r\nreverses; one day to abandon his abode covered with wounds, and the next\r\nto reascend with the _maur_ (crown) on his head.\" It was stipulated that\r\nonly five hundred horse should form his suite. As he approached Chitor,\r\nthe five sons of the Chauhan advanced to meet him, but on the portal of\r\nthe city no toran,[4.6.22] or nuptial emblem, was suspended. He,\r\nhowever, accepted the unsatisfactory reply to his remark on this\r\nindication of treachery, and ascended for the first time the ramp of\r\nChitor. He was received in the ancient halls of his ancestors by Rao\r\nMaldeo, his son Banbir, and other chiefs, _with folded hands_. The bride\r\nwas brought forth, and presented by her father without any of the\r\nsolemnities practised on such occasions; ‘the knot of their garments\r\ntied and their hands united,’ and thus they were left. The family priest\r\nrecommended patience, and Hamir retired with his bride to the apartments\r\nallotted for them. Her kindness and vows of fidelity overcame his\r\nsadness upon learning that he had married a widow. She had been wedded\r\nto a chief of the Bhatti tribe, shortly afterwards slain, and when she\r\nwas so young as not to recollect even his appearance. He ceased to\r\nlament the insult when she herself taught him how it might be avenged,\r\nand that it might even lead to the recovery of Chitor. It is a privilege\r\npossessed by the bridegroom to have one specific favour complied with as\r\na part of the dower (_daeja_), and Hamir was instructed by his bride to\r\nask for Jal, one of the civil [272] officers of Chitor, and of the Mehta\r\ntribe. With his wife so obtained, and the scribe whose talents remained\r\nfor trial, he returned in a fortnight to Kelwara. Khetsi was the fruit\r\nof this marriage, on which occasion Maldeo made over all the hill tracts\r\nto Hamir. Khetsi was a year old when one of the penates\r\n(Khetrpal)[4.6.23] was found at fault, on which she wrote to her parents\r\nto invite her to Chitor, that the infant might be placed before the\r\nshrine of the deity. Escorted by a party from Chitor, with her child she\r\nentered its walls; and instructed by the Mehta, she gained over the\r\ntroops who were left, for the Rao had gone with his chief adherents\r\nagainst the Mers of Madri. Hamir was at hand. Notice that all was ready\r\nreached him at Bagor. Still he met opposition that had nearly defeated\r\nthe scheme; but having forced admission, his sword overcame every\r\nobstacle, and the oath of allegiance (_an_) was proclaimed from the\r\npalace of his fathers.\r\n\r\nThe Sonigira on his return was met with ‘a salute of arabas,’[4.6.24]\r\nand Maldeo himself carried the account of his loss to the Khilji king\r\nMahmud, who had succeeded Ala. The ‘standard of the sun’ once more shone\r\nrefulgent from the walls of Chitor, and was the signal for return to\r\ntheir ancient abodes from their hills and hiding-places to the adherents\r\nof Hamir. The valleys of Kumbhalmer and the western highlands poured\r\nforth their ‘streams of men,’ while every chief of true Hindu blood\r\nrejoiced at the prospect of once more throwing off the barbarian yoke.\r\nSo powerful was this feeling, and with such activity and skill did Hamir\r\nfollow up this favour of fortune, that he marched to meet Mahmud, who\r\nwas advancing to recover his lost possessions. The king unwisely\r\ndirected his march by the eastern plateau, where numbers were rendered\r\nuseless by the intricacies of the country. Of the three steppes which\r\nmark the physiognomy of this tract, from the first ascent from the plain\r\nof Mewar to the descent at Chambal, the king had encamped on the\r\ncentral, at Singoli, where he was attacked, defeated, and made prisoner\r\nby Hamir, who slew Hari Singh, brother of Banbir, in single combat. The\r\nking suffered a confinement of three months in Chitor, nor was liberated\r\ntill he had surrendered Ajmer, Ranthambor, Nagor, and Sui Sopur, besides\r\npaying fifty lakhs of rupees and one hundred elephants. Hamir would\r\nexact no promise of cessation from further inroads, but contented\r\nhimself with assuring him that from such he should be prepared to defend\r\nChitor, not within, but without the walls [273].[4.6.25]\r\n\r\nBanbir, the son of Maldeo, offered to serve Hamir, who assigned the\r\ndistricts of Nimach, Jiran, Ratanpur, and the Kerar to maintain the\r\nfamily of his wife in becoming dignity; and as he gave the grant he\r\nremarked: “Eat, serve, and be faithful. You were once the servant of a\r\nTurk, but now of a Hindu of your own faith; for I have but taken back my\r\nown, the rock moistened by the blood of my ancestors, the gift of the\r\ndeity I adore, and who will maintain me in it; nor shall I endanger it\r\nby the worship of a fair face, as did my predecessor.” Banbir shortly\r\nafter carried Bhainsror by assault, and this ancient possession guarding\r\nthe Chambal was again added to Mewar. The chieftains of Rajasthan\r\nrejoiced once more to see a Hindu take the lead, paid willing homage,\r\nand aided him with service when required.\r\n\r\n=The Power of Rāna Hamīr Singh.=—Hamir was the sole Hindu prince of\r\npower now left in India: all the ancient dynasties were crushed, and the\r\nancestors of the present princes of Marwar and Jaipur brought their\r\nlevies, paid homage, and obeyed the summons of the prince of Chitor, as\r\ndid the chiefs of Bundi, Gwalior, Chanderi, Raesin, Sikri, Kalpi, Abu,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nExtensive as was the power of Mewar before the Tatar occupation of\r\nIndia, it could scarcely have surpassed the solidity of sway which she\r\nenjoyed during the two centuries following Hamir’s recovery of the\r\ncapital. From this event to the next invasion from the same Cimmerian\r\nabode, led by Babur, we have a succession of splendid names recorded in\r\nher annals, and though destined soon to be surrounded by new Muhammadan\r\ndynasties, in Malwa and Gujarat as well as Delhi, yet successfully\r\nopposing them all. The distracted state of affairs when the races of\r\nKhilji, Lodi, and Sur alternately struggled for and obtained the seat of\r\ndominion, Delhi, was favourable to Mewar, whose power was now so\r\nconsolidated that she not only repelled armies from her territory, but\r\ncarried war abroad, leaving tokens of victory at Nagor, in Saurashtra,\r\nand to the walls of Delhi.\r\n\r\n=Public Works.=—The subjects of Mewar must have enjoyed not only a long\r\nrepose, but high prosperity during this period, judging from their\r\nmagnificent public works, when a triumphal [274] column must have cost\r\nthe income of a kingdom to erect, and which ten years’ produce of the\r\ncrown-lands of Mewar could not at this time defray. Only one of the\r\nstructures prior to the sack of Chitor was left entire by Ala, and is\r\nyet existing, and this was raised by private and sectarian hands. It\r\nwould be curious if the unitarian profession of the Jain creed was the\r\nmeans of preserving this ancient relic from Ala’s wrath.[4.6.26] The\r\nprinces of this house were great patrons of the arts, and especially of\r\narchitecture; and it is a matter of surprise how their revenues, derived\r\nchiefly from the soil, could have enabled them to expend so much on\r\nthese objects and at the same time maintain such armies as are\r\nenumerated. Such could be effected only by long prosperity and a mild,\r\npaternal system of government; for the subject had his monuments as well\r\nas the prince, the ruins of which may yet be discovered in the more\r\ninaccessible or deserted portions of Rajasthan. Hamir died full of\r\nyears, leaving a name still honoured in Mewar, as one of the wisest and\r\nmost gallant of her princes, and bequeathing a well-established and\r\nextensive power to his son.\r\n\r\n=Kshetra or Khet Singh, A.D. 1364-82.=—Khetsi succeeded in S. 1421 (A.D.\r\n1365) to the power and to the character of his father. He captured Ajmer\r\nand Jahazpur from Lila Pathan, and reannexed Mandalgarh, Dasor, and the\r\nwhole of Chappan (for the first time) to Mewar. He obtained a victory\r\nover the Delhi monarch Humayun[4.6.27] at Bakrol; but unhappily his life\r\nterminated in a family broil with his vassal, the Hara chief of\r\nBumbaoda, whose daughter he was about to espouse.\r\n\r\n=Laksh Singh, A.D. 1382-97.=—Lakha Rana, by this assassination, mounted\r\nthe throne in Chitor in S. 1439 (A.D. 1373). His first act was the\r\nentire subjugation of the mountainous region of Merwara, and the\r\ndestruction of its chief stronghold, Bairatgarh, where he erected\r\nBadnor. But an event of much greater importance than settling his\r\nfrontier, and which most powerfully tended to the prosperity of the\r\ncountry, was the discovery of the tin and silver mines of Jawara, in the\r\ntract wrested by Khetsi from the Bhils of Chappan.[4.6.28] Lakha Rana\r\nhas the merit of having first worked them, though their existence is\r\nsuperstitiously alluded to so early as the period of the founder. It is\r\nsaid the ‘seven metals’ (_haft-dhat_)[4.6.29] were formerly [275]\r\nabundant; but this appears figurative. We have no evidence for the gold,\r\nthough silver, tin, copper, lead, and antimony were yielded in abundance\r\n(the first two from the same matrix), but the tin that has been\r\nextracted for many years past yields but a small portion of\r\nsilver.[4.6.30] Lakha Rana defeated the Sankhla Rajputs of\r\nNagarchal,[4.6.31] at Amber. He encountered the emperor Muhammad Shah\r\nLodi, and on one occasion defeated a royal army at Badnor; but he\r\ncarried the war to Gaya, and in driving the barbarian from this sacred\r\nplace was slain.[4.6.32] Lakha is a name of celebrity, as a patron of\r\nthe arts and benefactor of his country. He excavated many reservoirs and\r\nlakes, raised immense ramparts to dam their waters, besides erecting\r\nstrongholds. The riches of the mines of Jawara were expended to rebuild\r\nthe temples and palaces levelled by Ala. A portion of his own palace yet\r\nexists, in the same style of architecture as that, more ancient, of\r\nRatna and the fair Padmini; and a minster (_mandir_) dedicated to the\r\ncreator (Brahma), an enormous and costly fabric, is yet entire. Being to\r\n‘the One,’ and consequently containing no idol, it may thus have escaped\r\nthe ruthless fury of the invaders.\r\n\r\nLakha had a numerous progeny, who have left their clans called after\r\nthem, as the Lunawats and Dulawats, now the sturdy allodial proprietors\r\nof the Alpine regions bordering on Oghna, Panarwa, and other tracts in\r\nthe Aravalli.[4.6.33] But a circumstance which set aside the rights of\r\nprimogeniture, and transferred the crown of Chitor from his eldest son,\r\nChonda, to the younger, Mokal, had nearly carried it to another line.\r\nThe consequences of making the elder branch a powerful vassal clan with\r\nclaims to the throne, and which have been the chief cause of its\r\nsubsequent prostration, we will reserve for another chapter [276].\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.6.1:\r\n\r\n  [Rāna Lachhman Singh was not, strictly speaking, ruler of Chitor.

Two noble lines were reared from princes\r\n  of Chitor expelled on similar occasions; those of Sivaji and the\r\n  Gorkhas of Nepal. [This pedigree is largely the work of the bards. But\r\n  the Mahrattas, who seem to be chiefly sprung from the Kunbi peasantry,\r\n  claim Rājput origin, and several of their clans bear Rājput names. It\r\n  is said that in 1836 the Rāna of Mewār was satisfied that the Bhonslas\r\n  and certain other families had the right to be regarded as Rājputs\r\n  (_Census Report, Bombay_, 1901, i. 184 f.; Russell, _Tribes and Castes\r\n  Central Provinces_, iv. 199 ff.).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.6.16:\r\n\r\n  This is a poetical version of the name of Ajaisi; a liberty frequently\r\n  taken by the bards for the sake of rhyme.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.6.17:\r\n\r\n  [From an inscription at Chitor it appears that the fort remained in\r\n  the charge of Muhammadans up to the time of Muhammad Tughlak\r\n  (1324-51), who appointed Māldeo of Jālor governor (Erskine ii.

It consists of three wooden bars,\r\n  forming an equilateral triangle; mystic in shape and number, and\r\n  having the apex crowned with the effigies of a peacock, it is placed\r\n  over the portal of the bride’s abode. At Udaipur, when the princes of\r\n  Jaisalmer, Bikaner, and Kishangarh simultaneously married the two\r\n  daughters and granddaughter of the Rana, the torans were suspended\r\n  from the battlements of the tripolia, or three-arched portal, leading\r\n  to the palace. The bridegroom on horseback, lance in hand, proceeds to\r\n  break the toran (_toran torna_), which is defended by the damsels of\r\n  the bride, who from the parapet assail him with missiles of various\r\n  kinds, especially with a crimson powder made from the flowers of the\r\n  _palasa_, at the same time singing songs fitted to the occasion,\r\n  replete with double-entendres. At length the toran is broken amidst\r\n  the shouts of the retainers; when the fair defenders retire. The\r\n  similitude of these ceremonies in the north of Europe and in Asia\r\n  increases the list of common affinities, and indicates the violence of\r\n  rude times to obtain the object of affection; and the lance, with\r\n  which the Rajput chieftain breaks the toran, has the same emblematic\r\n  import as the spear, which, at the marriage of the nobles in Sweden,\r\n  was a necessary implement in the furniture of the marriage chamber\r\n  (vide Mallett, _Northern Antiquities_). [The custom perhaps represents\r\n  a symbol of marriage by capture, but it has also been suggested that\r\n  it symbolizes the luck of the bride’s family which the bridegroom\r\n  acquires by touching the arch with his sword (see Luard, _Ethnographic\r\n  Survey Central India_, 22; Enthoven, _Folk-lore Notes Gujarāt_, 69;\r\n  Russell, _Tribes and Castes Central Provinces_, ii. 410).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.6.23:\r\n\r\n  [Khetrpāl, Kshetrapāla, is guardian of the field (_Kshetra_).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.6.24:\r\n\r\n  A kind of arquebuss [properly the gun-carriage.

[There is a mistake here. The\r\n  successor of Alāu-d-dīn was Kutbu-d-dīn Mubārak, who came to the\r\n  throne in 1316. Ferishta says that Rāī Ratan Singh of Chitor, who had\r\n  been taken prisoner in the siege, was released by the cleverness of\r\n  his daughter, and that Alāu-d-dīn ordered his son, Khizr Khān, to\r\n  evacuate the place, on which the Rāī became tributary to Alāu-d-dīn.\r\n  Also in 1312 the Rājputs threw the Muhammadan officers over the\r\n  ramparts and asserted their independence (Ferishta, trans.

A\r\nsatirical impromptu, involving the sacrifice of Rajput prejudices,\r\ndissolved the coalition of the Rathors and Kachhwahas, and laid each\r\nprostrate before the Mahrattas, whom when united they had crushed: and a\r\njest, apparently trivial, compromised the right of primogeniture to the\r\nthrone of Chitor, and proved more disastrous in its consequences than\r\nthe arms either of Moguls or Mahrattas.\r\n\r\n=Chonda renounces his Birthright.=—Lakha Rana was advanced in years, his\r\nsons and grandsons established in suitable domains, when ‘the coco-nut\r\ncame’ from Ranmall, prince of Marwar, to affiance his daughter with\r\nChonda, the heir of Mewar. When the embassy was announced, Chonda was\r\nabsent, and the old chief was seated in his chair of state surrounded by\r\nhis court. The messenger of Hymen was courteously received by Lakha, who\r\nobserved that Chonda would soon return and take the gage; “for,” added\r\nhe, drawing his fingers over his moustaches, “I don’t suppose you send\r\nsuch playthings to an old greybeard like me.” This little sally was of\r\ncourse applauded and repeated; but Chonda, offended at delicacy being\r\nsacrificed to wit, declined accepting the symbol which his father had\r\neven in jest supposed might be intended for him: and as it could not be\r\nreturned without gross insult to Ranmall, the old Rana, incensed at his\r\nson’s obstinacy, agreed to accept it himself, provided Chonda would\r\nswear to renounce his birthright in the event of his having a son, and\r\nbe to the child but the ‘first of his Rajputs.’ He swore by Eklinga to\r\nfulfil his father’s wishes.\r\n\r\n=Rāna Mokala, A.D. 1397-1433.=—Mokalji was the issue of this union, and\r\nhad attained the age of five when the Rana resolved to signalize his\r\nfinale by a raid against the enemies of their faith [277], and to expel\r\nthe ‘barbarian’ from the holy land of Gaya. In ancient times this was by\r\nno means uncommon, and we have several instances in the annals of these\r\nStates of princes resigning ‘the purple’ on the approach of old age, and\r\nby a life of austerity and devotion, pilgrimage and charity, seeking to\r\nmake their peace with heaven “for the sins inevitably committed by all\r\nwho wield a sceptre.” But when war was made against their religion by\r\nthe Tatar proselytes to Islam, the Sutlej and the Ghaggar were as the\r\nbanks of the Jordan—Gaya, their Jerusalem, their holy land; and if there\r\ndestiny filled his cup, the Hindu chieftain was secure of\r\nbeatitude,[4.7.1] exempted from the troubles of ‘second birth’;[4.7.2]\r\nand borne from the scene of probation in celestial cars by the\r\nApsaras,[4.7.3] was introduced at once into the ‘realm of the\r\nsun.’[4.7.4] Ere, however, the Rana of Chitor journeyed to this bourne,\r\nhe was desirous to leave his throne unexposed to civil strife. The\r\nsubject of succession had never been renewed; but discussing with Chonda\r\nhis warlike pilgrimage to Gaya, from which he might not return, he\r\nsounded him by asking what estates should be settled on Mokal. “The\r\nthrone of Chitor,” was the honest reply; and to set suspicion at rest,\r\nhe desired that the ceremony of installation should be performed\r\nprevious to Lakha’s departure. Chonda was the first to pay homage and\r\nswear obedience and fidelity to his future sovereign: reserving, as the\r\nrecompense of his renunciation, the first place in the councils, and\r\nstipulating that in all grants to the vassals of the crown, his symbol\r\n(the lance) should be superadded to the autograph of the prince. In all\r\ngrants the lance of Salumbar[4.7.5] still precedes the monogram of the\r\nRana.[4.7.6]\r\n\r\nThe sacrifice of Chonda to offended delicacy and filial respect was\r\ngreat, for he had all the qualities requisite for command. Brave, frank,\r\nand skilful, he conducted all public affairs after his father’s\r\ndeparture and death, to the benefit of the minor and the State. The\r\nqueen-mother, however, who is admitted as the natural guardian of her\r\ninfant’s rights on all such occasions, felt umbrage and discontent at\r\nher loss of power; forgetting that, but for Chonda, she would never\r\n[278] have been mother to the Rana of Mewar. She watched with a jealous\r\neye all his proceedings; but it was only through the medium of suspicion\r\nshe could accuse the integrity of Chonda, and she artfully asserted\r\nthat, under colour of directing state affairs, he was exercising\r\nabsolute sovereignty, and that if he did not assume the title of Rana,\r\nhe would reduce it to an empty name. Chonda, knowing the purity of his\r\nown motives, made liberal allowance for maternal solicitude; but\r\nupbraiding the queen with the injustice of her suspicions, and advising\r\na vigilant care to the rights of Sesodias, he retired to the court of\r\nMandu, then rising into notice, where he was received with the highest\r\ndistinctions, and the district of Halar[4.7.7] was assigned to him by\r\nthe king.\r\n\r\n=Rāthor Influence in Mewār.=—His departure was the signal for an influx\r\nof the kindred of the queen from Mandor. Her brother Jodha (who\r\nafterwards gave his name to Jodhpur) was the first, and was soon\r\nfollowed by his father, Rao Ranmall, and numerous adherents, who deemed\r\nthe arid region of Maru-des, and its rabri, or maize porridge, well\r\nexchanged for the fertile plains and wheaten bread of Mewar.\r\n\r\n=Raghudeva, the Mewār Hero.=—With his grandson on his knee, the old Rao\r\n“would sit on the throne of Bappa Rawal, on whose quitting him for play,\r\nthe regal ensigns of Mewar waved over the head of Mandor.” This was more\r\nthan the Sesodia nurse[4.7.8] (an important personage in all Hindu\r\ngovernments) could bear, and bursting with indignation, she demanded of\r\nthe queen if her kin was to defraud her own child of his inheritance.\r\nThe honesty of the nurse was greater than her prudence. The creed of the\r\nRajput is to ‘obtain sovereignty,’ regarding the means as secondary and\r\nthis avowal of her suspicions only hastened their designs. The queen\r\nsoon found herself without remedy, and a remonstrance to her father\r\nproduced a hint which threatened the existence of her offspring. Her\r\nfears were soon after augmented by the assassination of Raghudeva, the\r\nsecond brother of Chonda, whose estates were Kelwara and Kawaria. To the\r\nformer place, where he resided aloof from the court, Rao Ranmall sent a\r\ndress of honour, which etiquette requiring him to put on when presented,\r\nthe prince was assassinated in the act. Raghudeva was so much beloved\r\nfor his virtues, courage, and manly beauty, that his [279] murder became\r\nmartyrdom, and obtained for him divine honours, and a place amongst the\r\n_Di Patres_ (_Pitrideva_) of Mewar. His image is on every hearth, and is\r\ndaily worshipped with the Penates. Twice in the year his altars receive\r\npublic homage from every Sesodia, from the Rana to the serf.[4.7.9]\r\n\r\n=The Expulsion of the Rāthor Party.=—In this extremity the queen-mother\r\nturned her thoughts to Chonda, and it was not difficult to apprise him\r\nof the danger which menaced the race, every place of trust being held by\r\nher kinsmen, and the principal post of Chitor by a Bhatti Rajput of\r\nJaisalmer. Chonda, though at a distance, was not inattentive to the\r\nproverbially dangerous situation of a minor amongst the Rajputs. At his\r\ndeparture he was accompanied by two hundred Aherias or huntsmen, whose\r\nancestors had served the princes of Chitor from ancient times. These had\r\nleft their families behind, a visit to whom was the pretext for their\r\nintroduction to the fort. They were instructed to get into the service\r\nof the keepers of the gates, and, being considered more attached to the\r\nplace than to the family, their object was effected. The queen-mother\r\nwas counselled to cause the young prince to descend daily with a\r\nnumerous retinue to give feasts to the surrounding villages, and\r\ngradually to increase the distance, but not to fail on the ‘festival of\r\nlamps’[4.7.10] to hold the feast (_got_) at Gosunda.[4.7.11]\r\n\r\nThese injunctions were carefully attended to. The day arrived, the feast\r\nwas held at Gosunda; but the night was closing in, and no Chonda\r\nappeared. With heavy hearts the nurse, the Purohit,[4.7.12] and those in\r\nthe secret moved homeward, and had reached the eminence called Chitori,\r\nwhen forty horsemen passed them at the gallop, and at their head Chonda\r\nin disguise, who by a secret sign paid homage as he passed to his\r\nyounger brother and sovereign. Chonda and [280] his band had reached the\r\nRampol,[4.7.13] or upper gate, unchecked. Here, when challenged, they\r\nsaid they were neighbouring chieftains, who, hearing of the feast at\r\nGosunda, had the honour to escort the prince home. The story obtained\r\ncredit; but the main body, of which this was but the advance, presently\r\ncoming up, the treachery was apparent. Chonda unsheathed his sword, and\r\nat his well-known shout the hunters were speedily in action. The Bhatti\r\nchief, taken by surprise, and unable to reach Chonda, launched his\r\ndagger at and wounded him, but was himself slain; the guards at the\r\ngates were cut to pieces, and the Rathors hunted out and killed without\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\n=Death of Rāo Ranmall.=—The end of Rāo Ranmall was more ludicrous than\r\ntragical. Smitten with the charms of a Sesodia handmaid of the queen,\r\nwho was compelled to his embrace, the old chief was in her arms,\r\nintoxicated with love, wine, and opium, and heard nothing of the tumult\r\nwithout. A woman’s wit and revenge combined to make his end afford some\r\ncompensation for her loss of honour. Gently rising, she bound him to his\r\nbed with his own Marwari turban:[4.7.14] nor did this disturb him, and\r\nthe messengers of fate had entered ere the opiate allowed his eyes to\r\nopen to a sense of his danger. Enraged, he in vain endeavoured to\r\nextricate himself; and by some tortuosity of movement he got upon his\r\nlegs, his pallet at his back like a shell or shield of defence. With no\r\narms but a brass vessel of ablution, he levelled to the earth several of\r\nhis assailants, when a ball from a matchlock extended him on the floor\r\nof the palace. His son Jodha was in the lower town, and was indebted to\r\nthe fleetness of his steed for escaping the fate of his father and\r\nkindred, whose bodies strewed the _terre-pleine_ of Chitor, the merited\r\nreward of their usurpation and treachery.\r\n\r\n=The Revenge of Chonda.=—But Chonda’s revenge was not yet satisfied. He\r\npursued Rao Jodha, who, unable to oppose him, took refuge with Harbuji\r\nSankhla, leaving Mandor to its fate. This city Chonda entered by\r\nsurprise, and holding it till his sons Kantatji and Manjaji arrived with\r\nreinforcements, the Rathor treachery was repaid by their keeping\r\npossession of the capital during twelve years. We might here leave the\r\nfuture founder of Jodhpur, had not this feud led to the junction of the\r\nrich [281] province of Godwar to Mewar, held for three centuries and\r\nagain lost by treachery. It may yet involve a struggle between the\r\nSesodias and Rathors.[4.7.15]\r\n\r\n“Sweet are the uses of adversity.” To Jodha it was the first step in the\r\nladder of his eventual elevation. A century and a half had scarcely\r\nelapsed since a colony, the wreck of Kanauj, found an asylum, and at\r\nlength a kingdom, taking possession of one capital and founding another,\r\nabandoning Mandor and erecting Jodhpur. But even Jodha could never have\r\nhoped that his issue would have extended their sway from the valley of\r\nthe Indus to within one hundred miles of the Jumna, and from the desert\r\nbordering on the Sutlej to the Aravalli mountains: that one hundred\r\nthousand swords should at once be in the hands of Rathors, ‘the sons of\r\none father’ (_ek Bap ke Betan_).\r\n\r\nIf we slightly encroach upon the annals of Marwar, it is owing to its\r\nhistory and that of Mewar being here so interwoven, and the incidents\r\nthese events gave birth so illustrative of the national character of\r\neach, that it is, perhaps, more expedient to advert to the period when\r\nJodha was shut out from Mandor, and the means by which he regained that\r\ncity, previous to relating the events of the reign of Mokal.\r\n\r\n=Harbuji Sānkhla.=—Harbuji Sankhla, at once a soldier and a devotee, was\r\none of those Rajput cavaliers ‘_sans peur et sans reproche_,’ whose life\r\nof celibacy and perilous adventure was mingled with the austere devotion\r\nof an ascetic; by turns aiding with his lance the cause which he deemed\r\nworthy, or exercising an unbounded hospitality towards the stranger.\r\nThis generosity had much reduced his resources when Jodha sought his\r\nprotection. It was the eve of the _Sada-bart_, one of those hospitable\r\nrites which, in former times, characterized Rajwara. This ‘perpetual\r\ncharity’ supplies food to the stranger and traveller, and is distributed\r\nnot only by individual chiefs and by the government, but by\r\nsubscriptions of communities. Even in Mewar, in her present impoverished\r\ncondition, the offerings to the gods in support of their shrines and the\r\nestablishment of the _Sada-bart_ were simultaneous. Hospitality is a\r\nvirtue pronounced to belong more peculiarly to a semi-barbarous\r\ncondition. Alas! for refinement and ultra-civilization, strangers to the\r\nhappiness enjoyed by Harbuji Sankhla. Jodha, with one hundred and twenty\r\nfollowers, came to solicit the ‘stranger’s fare’: but unfortunately it\r\nwas too late, the _Sada-bart_ had been distributed. In this exigence,\r\nHarbuji recollected that there was a wood [282] called _mujd_,[4.7.16]\r\nused in dyeing, which among other things in the desert regions is\r\nresorted to in scarcity. A portion of this was bruised, and boiled with\r\nsome flour, sugar, and spices, making altogether a palatable pottage;\r\nand with a promise of better fare on the morrow, it was set before the\r\nyoung Rao and his followers, who, after making a good repast, soon\r\nforgot Chitor in sleep. On waking, each stared at his fellow, for their\r\nmustachios were dyed with their evening’s meal; but the old chief, who\r\nwas not disposed to reveal his expedient, made it minister to their\r\nhopes by giving it a miraculous character, and saying “that as the grey\r\nof age was thus metamorphosed into the tint of morn[4.7.17] and hope, so\r\nwould their fortunes become young, and Mandor again be theirs.”\r\n\r\nElevated by this prospect, they enlisted Harbuji on their side. He\r\naccompanied them to the chieftain of Mewa, “whose stables contained one\r\nhundred chosen steeds.” Pabuji, a third independent of the same stamp,\r\nwith his ‘coal-black steed,’ was gained to the cause, and Jodha soon\r\nfound himself strong enough to attempt the recovery of his capital. The\r\nsons of Chonda were taken by surprise: but despising the numbers of the\r\nfoe, and ignorant who were their auxiliaries, they descended sword in\r\nhand to meet the assailants. The elder[4.7.18] son of Chonda with many\r\nadherents was slain; and the younger, deserted by the subjects of\r\nMandor, trusted to the swiftness of his horse for escape; but being\r\npursued, was overtaken and killed on the boundary of Godwar. Thus Jodha,\r\nin his turn, was revenged, but the ‘feud was not balanced.’ Two sons of\r\nChitor had fallen for one chief of Mandor. But wisely reflecting on the\r\noriginal aggression, and the superior power of Mewar, as well as his\r\nbeing indebted for his present success to foreign aid, Jodha sued for\r\npeace, and offered as the _mundkati_, or ‘price of blood,’ and ‘to\r\nquench the feud,’ that the spot where Manja fell should be the future\r\nbarrier of the two States. The entire province of Godwar was\r\ncomprehended in the cession, which for three centuries withstood every\r\ncontention, till the internal dissensions of the last half century,\r\nwhich grew out of the cause by which [283] it was obtained, and the\r\nchange of succession in Mewar severed this most valuable\r\nacquisition.[4.7.19]\r\n\r\nWho would imagine, after such deadly feuds between these rival States,\r\nthat in the very next succession these hostile frays were not only\r\nburied in oblivion, but that the prince of Marwar abjured ‘his turban\r\nand his bed’ till he had revenged the assassination of the prince of\r\nChitor, and restored his infant heir to his rights? The annals of these\r\nStates afford numerous instances of the same hasty, overbearing\r\ntemperament governing all; easily moved to strife, impatient of revenge,\r\nand steadfast in its gratification. But this satisfied, resentment\r\nsubsides. A daughter of the offender given to wife banishes its\r\nremembrance, and when the bard joins the lately rival names in the\r\ncouplet, each will complacently curl his mustachio over his lip as he\r\nhears his ‘renown expand like the lotus,’ and thus ‘the feud is\r\nextinguished.’ Thus have they gone on from time immemorial, and will\r\ncontinue, till what we may fear to contemplate. They have now neither\r\nfriend nor foe but the British. The Tatar invader sleeps in his tomb,\r\nand the Mahratta depredator is muzzled and enchained. To return.\r\n\r\n=Mokal, A.D. 1397-1433.=—Mokal, who obtained the throne by Chonda’s\r\nsurrender of his birthright, was not destined long to enjoy the\r\ndistinction, though he evinced qualities worthy of heading the Sesodias.\r\nHe ascended the throne in S. 1454 (A.D. 1398), at an important era in\r\nthe history of India; when Timur, who had already established the race\r\nof Chagatai in the kingdoms of Central Asia, and laid prostrate the\r\nthrone of Byzantium, turned his arms towards India. But it was not a\r\nfield for his ambition; and the event is not even noticed in the annals\r\nof Mewar: a proof that it did not affect their repose. But they record\r\nan attempted invasion by the king of Delhi, which is erroneously stated\r\nto have been by Firoz Shah. A grandson of this prince had indeed been\r\nset up, and compelled to flee from the arms of Timur, and as the\r\ndirection of his flight was Gujarat, it is not unlikely that the\r\nrecorded attempt to penetrate by the passes of Mewar may have been his\r\n[284]. Be this as it may, the Rana Mokal anticipated and met him beyond\r\nthe passes of the Aravalli, in the field of Raepur, and compelled him to\r\nabandon his enterprise. Pursuing his success, he took possession of\r\nSambhar and its salt lakes, and otherwise extended and strengthened his\r\nterritory, which the distracted state of the empire consequent to\r\nTimur’s invasion rendered a matter of little difficulty. Mokal finished\r\nthe palace commenced by Lakha, now a mass of ruins; and erected the\r\nshrine of Chaturbhuja, ‘the four-armed deity,’[4.7.20] in the western\r\nhills.\r\n\r\n=Lāl Bāi.=—Besides three sons, Rana Mokal had a daughter, celebrated for\r\nher beauty, called Lal Bai, or ‘the ruby.’ She was betrothed to the\r\nKhichi chieftain of Gagraun, who at the Hathleva[4.7.21] demanded the\r\npledge of succour on foreign invasion. Dhiraj, the son of the Khichi,\r\nhad come to solicit the stipulated aid against Hoshang of Malwa, who had\r\ninvested their capital. The Rana’s headquarters were then at Madri, and\r\nhe was employed in quelling a revolt of the mountaineers, when Dhiraj\r\narrived and obtained the necessary aid. Madri was destined to be the\r\nscene of the termination of Mokal’s career: he was assassinated by his\r\nuncles, the natural brothers of his father, from an unintentional\r\noffence, which tradition has handed down in all its details.\r\n\r\n=Assassination of Rāna Mokal.=—Chacha and Mera were the natural sons of\r\nKhetsi Rana (the predecessor of Lakha); their mother a fair handmaid of\r\nlow descent, generally allowed to be a carpenter’s daughter. ‘The fifth\r\nsons of Mewar’ (as the natural children are figuratively termed) possess\r\nno rank, and though treated with kindness, and entrusted with\r\nconfidential employments, the sons of the chiefs of the second class\r\ntake precedence of them, and ‘sit higher on the carpet.’ These brothers\r\nhad the charge of seven hundred horse in the train of Rana Mokal at\r\nMadri. Some chiefs at enmity with them, conceiving that they had\r\noverstepped their privileges, wished to see them humiliated. Chance\r\nprocured them the opportunity: which, however, cost their prince his\r\nlife. Seated in a grove with his chiefs around him, he inquired the name\r\nof a particular tree. The Chauhan chief, feigning ignorance, whispered\r\nhim to ask either of the brothers; and not perceiving their scope, he\r\nartlessly did so. “Uncle, what tree is this?” The sarcasm thus prompted\r\nthey considered as reflecting on their birth (being sons [285] of the\r\ncarpenter’s daughter), and the same day, while Mokal was at his\r\ndevotions, and in the act of counting his rosary, one blow severed his\r\narm from his body, while another stretched him lifeless. The brothers,\r\nquickly mounting their steeds, had the audacity to hope to surprise\r\nChitor, but the gates were closed upon them.\r\n\r\n=Rāna Kūmbha, A.D. 1433-68.=—Though the murder of Mokal is related to\r\nhave no other cause than the sarcasm alluded to, the precautions taken\r\nby the young prince Kumbha,[4.7.22] his successor, would induce a belief\r\nthat this was but the opening of a deep-laid conspiracy. The traitors\r\nreturned to the stronghold near Madri, and Kumbha trusted to the\r\nfriendship and good feeling of the prince of Marwar in this emergency.\r\nHis confidence was well repaid. The prince put his son at the head of a\r\nforce, and the retreat of the assassins being near his own frontier,\r\nthey were encountered and dislodged. From Madri they fled to Pai, where\r\nthey strengthened a fortress in the mountains named Ratakot; a lofty\r\npeak of the compound chain which encircles Udaipur, visible from the\r\nsurrounding country, as are the remains of this stronghold of the\r\nassassins. It would appear that their lives were dissolute, for they had\r\ncarried off the virgin daughter of a Chauhan, which led to their\r\neventual detection and punishment. Her father, Suja, had traced the\r\nroute of the ravishers, and, mixing with the workmen, found that the\r\napproaches to the place of their concealment were capable of being\r\nscaled. He was about to lay his complaint before his prince, when he met\r\nthe cavalcade of Kumbha and the Rathor. The distressed father, ‘covering\r\nhis face,’ disclosed the story of his own and daughter’s dishonour. They\r\nencamped till night at Delwara, when, led by the Chandana, they issued\r\nforth to surprise the authors of so many evils.\r\n\r\n=Suja and the Tiger.=—Arrived at the base of the rock, where the parapet\r\nwas yet low, they commenced the escalade, aided by the thick foliage.\r\nThe path was steep and rugged, and in the darkness of the night each had\r\ngrasped his neighbour’s skirt for security. Animated by a just revenge,\r\nthe Chauhan (Suja) led the way, when on reaching a ledge of the rock the\r\nglaring eyeballs of a tigress flashed upon him. Undismayed, he squeezed\r\nthe hand of the Rathor prince who followed him, and who on perceiving\r\nthe object of terror instantly buried his poignard in her heart. This\r\nomen was superb. They soon reached the summit. Some had ascended the\r\nparapet; others were scrambling over, when the minstrel [286] slipping,\r\nfell, and his drum, which was to have accompanied his voice in singing\r\nthe conquest, awoke by its crash the daughter of Chacha. Her father\r\nquieted her fears by saying it was only “the thunder and the rains of\r\nBhadon”: to fear God only and go to sleep, for their enemies were safe\r\nat Kelwa. At this moment the Rao and his party rushed in. Chacha and\r\nMera had no time to avoid their fate. Chacha was cleft in two by the\r\nChandana, while the Rathor prince laid Mera at his feet, and the spoils\r\nof Ratakot were divided among the assailants.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.7.1:\r\n\r\n  _Mukti._\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.7.2:\r\n\r\n  This is a literal phrase, denoting further transmigration of the soul,\r\n  which is always deemed a punishment.

Women pray for the safety of their children; husbands, that\r\n  their wives may be fruitful. Previously to this, a son of Bappa Rawal\r\n  was worshipped; but after the enshrinement of Raghudeva, the adoration\r\n  of Kulisputra was gradually abolished. Nor is this custom confined to\r\n  Mewar: there is a deified _Putra_ in every Rajput family—one who has\r\n  met a violent death. Besides Eklinga, the descendants of Bappa have\r\n  adopted numerous household divinities: the destinies of life and\r\n  death, Baenmata the goddess of the Chawaras, Nagnachian the serpent\r\n  divinity of the Rathors, and Khetrapal, or ‘fosterer of the field,’\r\n  have with many others obtained a place on the Sesodia altars. This\r\n  festival may not unaptly be compared to that of Adonis amongst the\r\n  Greeks, for the _Putra_ is worshipped chiefly by women.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.7.10:\r\n\r\n  The _Diwali_, from _diwa_, ‘a lamp.’ This festival is in honour of\r\n  Lakshmi, goddess of wealth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.7.11:\r\n\r\n  Seven miles south of Chitor, on the road to Malwa.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.7.12:\r\n\r\n  The family priest and instructor of youth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.7.13:\r\n\r\n  _Rampol_, ‘the gate of Ram.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.7.14:\r\n\r\n  Often sixty cubits in length.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.7.15:\r\n\r\n  [Godwār, including the Bāli and Desuri districts in S.E.

This is the wood also mentioned in the annals\r\n  of Gujarat, of which the temple to Adinath was constructed. It is said\r\n  to be indestructible even by fire. It has been surmised that the\r\n  fleets of Tyre frequented the Indian coast: could they thence have\r\n  carried the _Almujd_ for the temple of Solomon? [Almug, according to\r\n  the _Encyclopædia Biblica_ (i. 1196) is either Brazil-wood or red\r\n  sandalwood (_Pterocarpus santalinus_). Sir G. Watt, who has kindly\r\n  examined the question, thinks it very improbable that the _mujd_ of\r\n  the text is almug wood, because neither the true sandalwood (_Santalum\r\n  album_) nor the red sandalwood (_Pterocarpus santalinus_) is found in\r\n  Rājputāna. He identifies the _mujd_ of the text with _Moringa\r\n  concanensis_, a small tree found wild in Sind and the Konkan, which\r\n  yields a gum of considerable value, and its congener _Moringa\r\n  pterygosperma_ (_Comm.

Marwar has attained much grandeur\r\n  since the time of Jodha, and her resources are more unbroken than\r\n  those of Mewar, who, if she could redeem, could not, from its exposed\r\n  position, maintain the province against the brave Rathor.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.7.20:\r\n\r\n  [The four-armed Vishnu, the favourite deity of the Mertia Rāthors\r\n  (_Census Report, Rajputana, 1891_, ii. 26).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.7.21:\r\n\r\n  The ceremony of joining hands.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.7.22:\r\n\r\n  [His mother was a Pramār, Subhāgya Devi, daughter of Rāja Jaitmall,\r\n  Sānkhla.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 8\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rāna Kūmbha, A.D. 1433-68.=—Kumbha succeeded his father in S. 1475\r\n(A.D. 1419);[4.8.1] nor did any symptom of dissatisfaction appear to\r\nusher in his reign, which was one of great success amidst no common\r\ndifficulties. The bardic historians[4.8.2] do as much honour to the\r\nMarwar prince, who had made common cause with their sovereign in\r\nrevenging the death of his father, as if it had involved the security of\r\nhis crown; but this was a precautionary measure of the prince, who was\r\ninduced thus to act from several motives, and, above all, in accordance\r\nwith usage, which stigmatizes the refusal of aid when demanded: besides\r\n‘Kumbha was the nephew of Marwar.’\r\n\r\nIt has rarely occurred in any country to have possessed successively so\r\nmany energetic princes as ruled Mewar through several centuries. She was\r\nnow in the middle path of her glory, and enjoying the legitimate triumph\r\nof seeing the foes of her religion captives on the rock of her power. A\r\ncentury had elapsed since the bigot Ala had wreaked his vengeance on the\r\ndifferent monuments of art. Chitor had recovered the sack, and new\r\ndefenders had sprung up in the place [287] of those who had fallen in\r\ntheir ‘saffron robes,’ a sacrifice for her preservation. All that was\r\nwanting to augment her resources against the storms which were\r\ncollecting on the brows of Caucasus and the shores of the Oxus, and were\r\ndestined to burst on the head of his grandson Sanga, was effected by\r\nKumbha; who with Hamir’s energy, Lakha’s taste for the arts, and a\r\ngenius comprehensive as either and more fortunate, succeeded in all his\r\nundertakings, and once more raised the ‘crimson banner’ of Mewar upon\r\nthe banks of the Ghaggar, the scene of Samarsi’s defeat. Let us contrast\r\nthe patriarchal Hindu governments of this period with the despotism of\r\nthe Tatar invader.\r\n\r\nFrom the age of Shihabu-d-din, the conqueror of India, and his\r\ncontemporary Samarsi, to the time we have now reached, two entire\r\ndynasties, numbering twenty-four emperors and one empress, through\r\nassassination, rebellion, and dethronement, had followed in rapid\r\nsuccession, yielding a result of only nine years to a reign. Of Mewar,\r\nthough several fell in defending their altars at home or their religion\r\nabroad, eleven princes suffice to fill the same period.\r\n\r\nIt was towards the close of the Khilji dynasty that the satraps of Delhi\r\nshook off its authority and established subordinate kingdoms: Bijapur\r\nand Golkonda in the Deccan; Malwa, Gujarat, Jaunpur in the east; and\r\neven Kalpi had its king. Malwa and Gujarat had attained considerable\r\npower when Kumbha ascended the throne. In the midst of his prosperity\r\nthese two States formed a league against him, and in S. 1496 (A.D. 1440)\r\nboth kings, at the head of powerful armies, invaded Mewar. Kumbha met\r\nthem on the plains of Malwa bordering on his own State, and at the head\r\nof one hundred thousand horse and foot and fourteen hundred elephants,\r\ngave them an entire defeat, carrying captive to Chitor Mahmud the Khilji\r\nsovereign of Malwa.\r\n\r\nAbu-l Fazl relates this victory, and dilates on Kumbha’s greatness of\r\nsoul in setting his enemy at liberty, not only without ransom but with\r\ngifts.[4.8.3] Such is the character of the Hindu: a mixture of\r\narrogance, political blindness, pride, and generosity. To spare a\r\nprostrate foe is the creed of the Hindu cavalier, and he carries all\r\nsuch maxims to excess. The annals, however, state that Mahmud was\r\nconfined six months in Chitor; and that the trophies of conquest were\r\nretained we have evidence from Babur, who mentions receiving from the\r\nson of his opponent, Sanga, the crown of the Malwa king.\r\n\r\n=The Tower of Victory.=—But there is a more durable [288] monument than\r\nthis written record of victory: the triumphal pillar in Chitor, whose\r\ninscriptions detail the event, “when, shaking the earth, the lords of\r\nGujarkhand and Malwa, with armies overwhelming as the ocean, invaded\r\nMedpat.” Eleven years after this event Kumbha laid the foundations of\r\nthis column, which was completed in ten more: a period apparently too\r\nshort to place “this ringlet on the brow of Chitor, which makes her look\r\ndown upon Meru with derision.” We will leave it, with the aspiration\r\nthat it may long continue a monument of the fortune of its\r\nfounders.[4.8.4]\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the Malwa king afterwards united his arms with\r\nKumbha, as, in a victory gained over the imperial forces at Jhunjhunu,\r\nwhen ‘he planted his standard in Hissar,’ the Malwa troops were combined\r\nwith those of Mewar. The imperial power had at this period greatly\r\ndeclined: the Khutba was read in the mosques in the name of Timur, and\r\nthe Malwa king had defeated, single-handed, the last Ghorian sultan of\r\nDelhi.\r\n\r\n=The Fortresses of Mewār.=—Of eighty-four fortresses for the defence of\r\nMewar, thirty-two were erected by Kumbha. Inferior only to Chitor is\r\nthat stupendous work called after him Kumbhalmer,[4.8.5] ‘the hill of\r\nKumbha,’ from its natural position, and the works he raised, impregnable\r\nto a native army. These works were on the site of a more ancient\r\nfortress, of which the mountaineers long held possession. Tradition\r\nascribes it to Samprati Raja, a Jain prince in the second century, and a\r\ndescendant of Chandragupta;[4.8.6] and the ancient Jain temples appear\r\nto confirm the tradition. When Kumbha captured Nagor he brought away the\r\ngates, with the statue of the god Hanuman, who gives his name to the\r\ngate which he still guards. He also erected a citadel on a peak of Abu,\r\nwithin the fortress of the ancient Pramara, where he often resided. Its\r\nmagazine and alarm-tower still bear Kumbha’s name; and in a rude temple\r\nthe bronze effigies of Kumbha and his father still receive divine\r\nhonours.[4.8.7] Centuries have passed since the princes of Mewar had\r\ninfluence here, but the incident marks the vivid remembrance of their\r\ncondition. He fortified the passes between the western frontier and Abu,\r\nand erected the fort Vasanti near the present Sirohi, and that of\r\nMachin, to defend the Shero Nala and Deogarh against the Mers of\r\nAravalli. He re-established Ahor and other smaller [289] forts to\r\noverawe the Bhumia[4.8.8] Bhil of Jharol and Panarwa, and defined the\r\nboundaries of Marwar and Mewar.\r\n\r\n=Temples.=—Besides these monuments of his genius, two consecrated to\r\nreligion have survived: that of Kumbha Sham, on Abu, which, though\r\nworthy to attract notice elsewhere, is here eclipsed by a crowd of more\r\ninteresting objects; the other, one of the largest edifices existing,\r\ncost upwards of a million sterling, towards which Kumbha contributed\r\neighty thousand pounds. It is erected in the Sadri pass leading from the\r\nwestern descent of the highlands of Mewar, and is dedicated to\r\nRishabhadeva.[4.8.9] Its secluded position has preserved it from bigoted\r\nfury, and its only visitants now are the wild beasts who take shelter in\r\nits sanctuary. Kumbha Rana was also a poet: but in a far more elevated\r\nstrain than the troubadour princes, his neighbours, who contented\r\nthemselves with rehearsing their own prowess or celebrating their lady’s\r\nbeauty. He composed a _tika_, or appendix to the ‘Divine\r\nMelodies,’[4.8.10] in praise of Krishna. We can pass no judgment on\r\nthese inspirations of the royal bard, as we are ignorant whether any are\r\npreserved in the records of the house: a point his descendant, who is\r\ndeeply skilled in such lore, might probably answer.\r\n\r\n=Mīra Bāi.=—Kumbha married a daughter of the Rathor of Merta, the first\r\nof the clans of Marwar. Mira Bai[4.8.11] was the most celebrated\r\nprincess of her time for beauty and romantic piety. Her compositions\r\nwere numerous, though better known to the worshippers of the Hindu\r\nApollo than to the ribald bards. Some of her odes and hymns to the deity\r\nare preserved and admired. Whether she imbibed her poetic piety from her\r\nhusband, or whether from her he caught the sympathy which produced the\r\n‘sequel to the songs of Govinda,’ we cannot determine. Her history is a\r\nromance, and her excess of devotion at every shrine of the favourite\r\ndeity with the fair of Hind, from the Yamuna to ‘the world’s\r\nend,’[4.8.12] gave rise to many [290] tales of scandal. Kumbha mixed\r\ngallantry with his warlike pursuits. He carried off the daughter of the\r\nchief of Jhalawar, who had been betrothed to the prince of Mandor: this\r\nrenewed the old feud, and the Rathor made many attempts to redeem his\r\naffianced bride. His humiliation was insupportable, when through the\r\npurified atmosphere of the periodical rains “the towers of Kumbhalmer\r\nbecame visible from the castle of Mandor, and the light radiated from\r\nthe chamber of the fair through the gloom of a night in Bhadon,[4.8.13]\r\nto the hall where he brooded o’er his sorrows.” It was surmised that\r\nthis night-lamp was an understood signal of the Jhalani, who pined at\r\nthe decree which ambition had dictated to her father, in consigning her\r\nto the more powerful rival of her affianced lord. The Rathor exhausted\r\nevery resource to gain access to the fair, and had once nearly succeeded\r\nin a surprise by escalade, having cut his way in the night through the\r\nforest in the western and least guarded acclivity: but, as the bard\r\nequivocally remarks, \"though he cut his way through the _jhal_\r\n(brushwood), he could not reach the _Jhalani_.\"\r\n\r\n=The Assassination of Rāna Kūmbha, A.D. 1468.=—Kumbha had occupied the\r\nthrone half a century; he had triumphed over the enemies of his race,\r\nfortified his country with strongholds, embellished it with temples, and\r\nwith the superstructure of her fame had laid the foundation of his\r\nown—when, the year which should have been a jubilee was disgraced by the\r\nfoulest blot in the annals; and his life, which nature was about to\r\nclose, terminated by the poignard of an assassin—that assassin, his son!\r\n\r\n=Rāna Uda, A.D. 1468-73.=—This happened in S. 1525 (A.D. 1469). Uda was\r\nthe name of the parricide, whose unnatural ambition, and impatience to\r\nenjoy a short lustre of sovereignty, bereft of life the author of his\r\nexistence. But such is the detestation which marks this unusual crime\r\nthat, like that of the Venetian traitor, his name is left a blank in the\r\nannals, nor is Uda known but by the epithet _Hatyara_, ‘the murderer.’\r\nShunned by his kin, and compelled to look abroad for succour to maintain\r\nhim on the throne polluted by his crime, Mewar in five years of\r\nillegitimate rule lost half the consequence which had cost so many to\r\nacquire. He made the Deora prince independent in Abu, and bestowed\r\nSambhar, Ajmer, and adjacent districts on the prince of Jodhpur[4.8.14]\r\nas the price of his friendship. But, a prey to remorse, he felt that he\r\n[291] could neither claim regard from, nor place any dependence upon,\r\nthese princes, though he bribed them with provinces. He humbled himself\r\nbefore the king of Delhi, offering him a daughter in marriage to obtain\r\nhis sanction to his authority; “but heaven manifested its vengeance to\r\nprevent this additional iniquity, and preserve the house of Bappa Rawal\r\nfrom dishonour.” He had scarcely quitted the divan (_diwankhana_), on\r\ntaking leave of the king, when a flash of lightning struck the _Hatyara_\r\nto the earth, whence he never arose.[4.8.15] The bards pass over this\r\nperiod cursorily, as one of their race was the instrument of Uda’s\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n=Banishment of the Chārans.=—There has always been a jealousy between\r\nthe Mangtas, as they term all classes ‘who extend the palm,’ whether\r\nBrahmans, Yatis, Charans, or Bhats; but since Hamir, the Charan\r\ninfluence had far eclipsed the rest. A Brahman astrologer predicted\r\nKumbha’s death through a Charan, and as the class had given other cause\r\nof offence, Kumbha banished the fraternity his dominions, resuming all\r\ntheir lands: a strong measure in those days, and which few would have\r\nhad nerve to attempt or firmness to execute. The heir-apparent, Raemall,\r\nwho was exiled to Idar for what his father deemed an impertinent\r\ncuriosity,[4.8.16] had attached one of these bards to his suite, whose\r\ningenuity got the edict set aside, and his race restored to their lands\r\nand the prince’s favour. Had they taken off the Brahman’s head, they\r\nmight have falsified the prediction which unhappily was too soon\r\nfulfilled.[4.8.17]\r\n\r\n=Rāna Rāemall, A.D. 1473-1508.=—Raemall succeeded in S. 1530 (A.D. 1474)\r\nby his own valour to the seat of Kumbha. He had fought and defeated the\r\nusurper, who on this occasion fled to the king of Delhi and offered him\r\na daughter of Mewar. After his death in the manner described, the Delhi\r\nmonarch, with Sahasmall [292] and Surajmall, sons of the parricide,\r\ninvaded Mewar, encamping at Siarh, now Nathdwara. The chiefs were\r\nfaithful to their legitimate prince, Raemall, and aided by his allies of\r\nAbu and Girnar, at the head of fifty-eight thousand horse and eleven\r\nthousand foot, he gave battle to the pretender and his imperial ally at\r\nGhasa. The conflict was ferocious. ‘The streams ran blood,’ for the sons\r\nof the usurper were brave as lions; but the king was so completely\r\nrouted that he never again entered Mewar.\r\n\r\nRaemall bestowed one daughter on Surji (Yadu), the chief of Girnar; and\r\nanother on the Deora, Jaimall of Sirohi, confirming his title to Abu as\r\nher dower. He sustained the warlike reputation of his predecessors, and\r\ncarried on interminable strife with Ghiyasu-d-din of Malwa, whom he\r\ndefeated in several pitched battles, to the success of which the valour\r\nof his nephews, whom he had pardoned, mainly contributed. In the last of\r\nthese encounters the Khilji king sued for peace, renouncing the\r\npretensions he had formerly urged.[4.8.18] The dynasty of Lodi next\r\nenjoyed the imperial bauble, and with it Mewar had to contest her\r\nnorthern boundary.\r\n\r\n=The Sons of Rāna Rāemall.=—Raemall had three sons, celebrated in the\r\nannals of Rajasthan: Sanga, the competitor of Babur, Prithiraj, the\r\nRolando of his age, and Jaimall. Unhappily for the country and their\r\nfather’s repose, fraternal affection was discarded for deadly hate, and\r\ntheir feuds and dissensions were a source of constant alarm. Had discord\r\nnot disunited them, the reign of Raemall would have equalled any of his\r\npredecessors. As it was, it presented a striking contrast to them: his\r\ntwo elder sons banished; the first, Sanga, self-exiled from perpetual\r\nfear of his life, and Prithiraj, the second, from his turbulence; while\r\nthe youngest, Jaimall, was slain through his intemperance. A sketch of\r\nthese feuds will present a good picture of the Rajput character, and\r\ntheir mode of life when their arms were not required against their\r\ncountry’s foes.\r\n\r\nSanga[4.8.19] and Prithiraj were the offspring of the Jhali queen;\r\nJaimall was by another mother. What moral influence the name he bore\r\nhad on Prithiraj we can surmise only from his actions, which would\r\nstand comparison with those of his prototype [293] the Chauhan of\r\nDelhi, and are yet the delight of the Sesodia. When they assemble at\r\nthe feast after a day’s sport, or in a sultry evening spread the\r\ncarpet on the terrace to inhale the leaf or take a cup of\r\nkusumbha,[4.8.20] a tale of Prithiraj recited by the bard is the\r\nhighest treat they can enjoy. Sanga, the heir-apparent, was a contrast\r\nto his brother. Equally brave, his courage was tempered by reflection;\r\nwhile Prithiraj burned with a perpetual thirst for action, and often\r\nobserved “that fate must have intended him to rule Mewar.” The three\r\nbrothers, with their uncle, Surajmall, were one day discussing these\r\ntopics, when Sanga observed that, though heir to ‘the ten thousand\r\ntowns’ of Mewar, he would waive his claims, and trust them, as did the\r\nRoman brothers, to the omen which should be given by the priestess of\r\nCharani Devi at Nahra Magra,[4.8.21] the ‘Tiger’s Mount.’ They\r\nrepaired to her abode. Prithiraj and Jaimall entered first, and seated\r\nthemselves on a pallet: Sanga followed and took possession of the\r\npanther hide of the prophetess; his uncle, Surajmall, with one knee\r\nresting thereon. Scarcely had Prithiraj disclosed their errand, when\r\nthe sibyl pointed to the panther-hide[4.8.22] as the decisive omen of\r\nsovereignty to Sanga, with a portion to his uncle. They received the\r\ndecree as did the twins of Rome. Prithiraj drew his sword and would\r\nhave falsified the omen, had not Surajmall stepped in and received the\r\nblow destined for Sanga, while the prophetess fled from their fury.\r\nSurajmall and Prithiraj were exhausted with wounds, and Sanga fled\r\nwith five sword-cuts and an arrow in his eye, which destroyed the\r\nsight for ever. He made for the sanctuary of Chaturbhuja, and passing\r\nSivanti, took refuge with Bida (Udawat), who was accoutred for a\r\njourney, his steed standing by him. Scarcely had he assisted the\r\nwounded heir of Mewar to alight when Jaimall galloped up in pursuit.\r\nThe Rathor guarded the sanctuary, and gave up his life in defence of\r\nhis guest, who meanwhile escaped.\r\n\r\n=Retirement of Sanga.=—Prithiraj recovered from his wounds; and Sanga,\r\naware of his implacable enmity, had recourse to many expedients to avoid\r\ndiscovery. He, who at a future period leagued a hundred thousand men\r\nagainst the descendant of Timur, was compelled to associate with\r\ngoat-herds, expelled the peasant’s abode as too stupid [294] to tend his\r\ncattle, and, precisely like our Alfred the Great, having in charge some\r\ncakes of flour, was reproached with being more desirous of eating than\r\ntending them. A few faithful Rajputs found him in this state, and,\r\nproviding him with arms and a horse, they took service with Rao\r\nKaramchand, Pramar, chief of Srinagar,[4.8.23] and with him ‘ran the\r\ncountry.’ After one of these raids, Sanga one day alighted under a\r\nbanian tree, and placing his dagger under his head, reposed, while two\r\nof his faithful Rajputs, whose names are preserved,[4.8.24] prepared his\r\nrepast, their steeds grazing by them. A ray of the sun penetrating the\r\nfoliage, fell on Sanga’s face, and discovered a snake, which, feeling\r\nthe warmth, had uncoiled itself and was rearing its crest over the head\r\nof the exile:[4.8.25] a bird of omen[4.8.26] had perched itself on the\r\ncrested serpent, and was chattering aloud. A goat-herd named Maru,\r\n‘versed in the language of birds,’ passed at the moment Sanga awoke. The\r\nprince repelled the proffered homage of the goat-herd, who, however, had\r\nintimated to the Pramara chief that he was served by ‘royalty.’[4.8.27]\r\nThe Pramara kept the secret, and gave Sanga a daughter to wife, and\r\nprotection till the tragical end of his brother called him to the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\n=The Adventures of Prithirāj.=—When the Rana heard of the quarrel which\r\nhad nearly deprived him of his heir, he banished Prithiraj, telling him\r\nthat he might live on his bravery and maintain himself with strife. With\r\nbut five horse[4.8.28] Prithiraj quitted the paternal abode, and made\r\nfor Bali in Godwar. These dissensions following the disastrous\r\nconclusion of the last reign, paralysed the country, and the wild tribes\r\nof the west and the mountaineers of the Aravalli so little respected the\r\ngarrison of Nadol (the chief town of Godwar), that they carried their\r\ndepredations to the plains. Prithiraj halted at Nadol, and having to\r\nprocure some necessaries pledged a ring to the merchant who had sold it\r\nto him; the merchant recognized the prince, and learning the cause of\r\nhis disguise, proffered his services in the scheme which the prince had\r\nin view for the restoration of order in Godwar, being determined to\r\nevince to his father that he had resources independent of birth. The\r\nMinas were the aboriginal proprietors of all these regions; the Rajputs\r\nwere interlopers and conquerors. A Rawat of this tribe had regained\r\ntheir ancient haunts, and held his petty court at the [295] town of\r\nNarlai in the plains, and was even served by Rajputs. By the advice of\r\nOjha, the merchant, Prithiraj enlisted himself and his band among the\r\nadherents of the Mina. On the Aheria, or ‘hunter’s festival,’ the\r\nvassals have leave to rejoin their families. Prithiraj, who had also\r\nobtained leave, rapidly retraced his steps, and despatching his Rajputs\r\nto dislodge the Mina, awaited the result in ambush at the gate of the\r\ntown. In a short time the Mina appeared on horseback, and in full flight\r\nto the mountains for security, Prithiraj pursued, overtook, and\r\ntransfixed him with his lance to a kesula tree, and setting fire to the\r\nvillage, he slew the Minas as they sought to escape the flames. Other\r\ntowns shared the same fate, and all the province of Godwar, with the\r\nexception of Desuri, a stronghold of the Madrecha Chauhans, fell into\r\nhis power. At this time Sada Solanki, whose ancestor had escaped the\r\ndestruction of Patan and found refuge in these mountainous tracts, held\r\nSodhgarh. He had espoused a daughter of the Madrecha, but the grant of\r\nDesuri and its lands[4.8.29] in perpetuity easily gained him to the\r\ncause of Prithiraj.\r\n\r\nPrithiraj having thus restored order in Godwar, and appointed Ojha and\r\nthe Solanki to the government thereof, regained the confidence of his\r\nfather; and his brother Jaimall being slain at this time, accelerated\r\nhis forgiveness and recall. Ere he rejoins Raemall we will relate the\r\nmanner of this event. Jaimall was desirous to obtain the hand of Tara\r\nBai, daughter of Rao Surthan,[4.8.30] who had been expelled Toda by the\r\nPathans. The price of her hand was the recovery of this domain: but\r\nJaimall, willing to anticipate the reward, and rudely attempting access\r\nto the fair, was slain by the indignant father. The quibbling remark of\r\nthe bard upon this event is that \"Tara was not the star (_tara_) of his\r\ndestiny.\" At the period of this occurrence Sanga was in concealment,\r\nPrithiraj banished, and Jaimall consequently looked to as the heir of\r\nMewar. The Rana, when incited to revenge, replied with a magnanimity\r\nwhich deserves to be recorded, \"that he who had thus dared to insult the\r\nhonour of a [296] father, and that father in distress, richly merited\r\nhis fate\"; and in proof of his disavowal of such a son he conferred on\r\nthe Solanki the district of Badnor.\r\n\r\n=Prithirāj recalled.=—This event led to the recall of Prithiraj, who\r\neagerly took up the gage disgraced by his brother. The adventure was\r\nakin to his taste. The exploit which won the hand of the fair Amazon,\r\nwho, equipped with bow and quiver, subsequently accompanied him in many\r\nperilous enterprises, will be elsewhere related.\r\n\r\nSurajmall (the uncle), who had fomented these quarrels, resolved not to\r\nbelie the prophetess if a crown lay in his path. The claims acquired\r\nfrom his parricidal parent were revived when Mewar had no sons to look\r\nto. Prithiraj on his return renewed the feud with Surajmall, whose\r\n‘vaulting ambition’ persuaded him that the crown was his destiny, and he\r\nplunged deep into treason to obtain it. He joined as partner in his\r\nschemes Sarangdeo, another descendant of Lakha Rana, and both repaired\r\nto Muzaffar, the sultan of Malwa.[4.8.31] With his aid they assailed the\r\nsouthern frontier, and rapidly possessed themselves of Sadri, Bataro,\r\nand a wide tract extending from Nai to Nimach, attempting even Chitor.\r\nWith the few troops at hand Raemall descended to punish the rebels, who\r\nmet the attack on the river Gambhir.[4.8.32] The Rana, fighting like a\r\ncommon soldier, had received two-and-twenty wounds, and was nearly\r\nfalling through faintness, when Prithiraj joined him with one thousand\r\nfresh horse, and reanimated the battle. He selected his uncle Surajmall,\r\nwhom he soon covered with wounds. Many had fallen on both sides, but\r\nneither party would yield; when worn out they mutually retired from the\r\nfield, and bivouacked in sight of each other.\r\n\r\n=Interview between Prithirāj and Sūrajmall.=—It will show the manners\r\nand feelings so peculiar to the Rajput, to describe the meeting between\r\nthe rival uncle and nephew,—unique in the details of strife, perhaps,\r\nsince the origin of man. It is taken from a MS. of the Jhala chief who\r\nsucceeded Surajmall in Sadri. Prithiraj visited his uncle, whom he found\r\nin a small tent reclining on a pallet, having just had ‘the barber’\r\n(_nai_) to sew up his wounds. He rose, and met his nephew with the\r\ncustomary respect, as if nothing unusual had occurred; but the exertion\r\ncaused some of the wounds to open afresh, when the following dialogue\r\nensued:\r\n\r\n_Prithiraj._—“Well, uncle, how are your wounds?”\r\n\r\n_Surajmall._—“Quite healed, my child, since I have the pleasure of\r\nseeing you” [297].\r\n\r\n_Prithiraj._—\"But, uncle (_kaka_), I have not yet seen the\r\nDiwanji.[4.8.33] I first ran to see you, and I am very hungry; have you\r\nanything to eat?\"\r\n\r\nDinner was soon served, and the extraordinary pair sat down and ‘ate off\r\nthe same platter’;[4.8.34] nor did Prithiraj hesitate to eat the\r\npan,[4.8.35] presented on his taking leave.\r\n\r\n_Prithiraj._—“You and I will end our battle in the morning, uncle.”\r\n\r\n_Surajmall._—“Very well, child; come early!”\r\n\r\nThey met; but Sarangdeo bore the brunt of the conflict, receiving\r\nthirty-five wounds. During “four gharis[4.8.36] swords and lances were\r\nplied, and every tribe of Rajput lost numbers that day”; but the rebels\r\nwere defeated and fled to Sadri, and Prithiraj returned in triumph,\r\nthough with seven wounds, to Chitor. The rebels, however, did not\r\nrelinquish their designs, and many personal encounters took place\r\nbetween the uncle and nephew: the latter saying he would not let him\r\nretain “as much land of Mewar as would cover a needle’s point”; and\r\nSuja[4.8.37] retorting, that he would allow his nephew to redeem only as\r\nmuch “as would suffice to lie upon.” But Prithiraj gave them no rest,\r\npursuing them from place to place. In the wilds of Batara they formed a\r\nstockaded retreat of the dhao tree,[4.8.38] which abounds in these\r\nforests. Within this shelter, horses and men were intermingled: Suja and\r\nhis coadjutor communing by the night-fire in their desperate plight,\r\nwhen their cogitations were checked by the rush and neigh of horses.\r\nScarcely had the pretender exclaimed “This must be my nephew!” when\r\nPrithiraj dashed his steed through the barricade and entered with his\r\ntroops. All was confusion, and the sword showered its blows\r\nindiscriminately. The young prince reached his uncle, and dealt him a\r\nblow which would have levelled him, but for the support of Sarangdeo,\r\nwho upbraided him, adding that “a buffet now was more than a score of\r\nwounds in former days”: to which Suja rejoined, “only when dealt by my\r\nnephew’s hand.” Suja demanded a parley; and calling on the prince to\r\nstop the combat, he continued: \"If I am killed, it matters not—my\r\nchildren are Rajputs, they will run the [298] country to find support;\r\nbut if you are slain, what will become of Chitor? My face will be\r\nblackened, and my name everlastingly reprobated.\"\r\n\r\nThe sword was sheathed, and as the uncle and nephew embraced, the latter\r\nasked the former, \"What were you about, uncle, when I came?\"—“Only\r\ntalking nonsense, child, after dinner.” \"But with me over your head,\r\nuncle, as a foe how could you be so negligent?\"—“What could I do? you\r\nhad left me no resource, and I must have some place to rest my head!”\r\nThere was a small temple near the stockade, to which in the morning\r\nPrithiraj requested his uncle to accompany him to sacrifice to\r\nKali,[4.8.39] but the blow of the preceding night prevented him.\r\nSarangdeo was his proxy. One buffalo had fallen, and a goat was about to\r\nfollow, when the prince turned his sword on Sarangdeo. The combat was\r\ndesperate; but Prithiraj was the victor, and the head of the traitor was\r\nplaced as an offering on the altar of Time. The Gaunda[4.8.40] was\r\nplundered, the town of Batara recovered, and Surajmall fled to Sadri,\r\nwhere he only stopped to fulfil his threat, “that if he could not retain\r\nits lands he would make them over to those stronger than the\r\nking”;[4.8.41] and having distributed them amongst Brahmans and bards,\r\nhe finally abandoned Mewar. Passing through the wilds of\r\nKanthal,[4.8.42] he had an omen which recalled the Charani’s prediction:\r\n“a wolf endeavouring in vain to carry off a kid defended by maternal\r\naffection.” This was interpreted as ‘strong ground for a dwelling.’ He\r\nhalted, subdued the aboriginal tribes, and on this spot erected the town\r\nand stronghold of Deolia, becoming lord of a thousand villages, which\r\nhave descended to his offspring, who now enjoy them under British\r\nprotection. Such was the origin of Partabgarh Deolia.[4.8.43]\r\n\r\n=Prithirāj poisoned: Death of Rāna Rāemall.=—Prithiraj was poisoned by\r\nhis brother-in-law, of Abu, whom he had punished for maltreating his\r\nsister, and afterwards confided in. His death was soon followed by that\r\nof Rana Raemall, who, though not equal to his predecessors, was greatly\r\nrespected, and maintained the dignity of his station amidst no ordinary\r\ncalamities [299].[4.8.44]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 9\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rāna Sanga or Sangrām Singh; A.D. 1508-27=.—Sangram, better known in\r\nthe annals of Mewar as Sanga (called Sanka by the Mogul\r\nhistorians),[4.9.1] succeeded in S. 1565 (A.D. 1509). With this prince\r\nMewar reached the summit of her prosperity. To use their own metaphor,\r\n“he was the kalas[4.9.2] on the pinnacle of her glory.” From him we\r\nshall witness this glory on the wane; and though many rays of splendour\r\nilluminated her declining career, they served but to gild the ruin.\r\n\r\nThe imperial chair, since occupied by the Tuar descendant of the Pandus,\r\nand the first and last of the Chauhans, and which had been filled\r\nsuccessively by the dynasties of Ghazni and Ghor, the Khilji and Lodi,\r\nwas now shivered to pieces, and numerous petty thrones were constructed\r\nof its fragments. Mewar little dreaded these imperial puppets, “when\r\nAmurath to Amurath succeeded,” and when four kings reigned\r\nsimultaneously between Delhi and Benares.[4.9.3] The kings of Malwa,\r\nthough leagued with those of Gujarat, conjoined to the rebels, could\r\nmake no impression on Mewar when Sanga led her heroes. Eighty thousand\r\nhorse, seven Rajas of the highest rank, nine Raos, and one hundred and\r\nfour chieftains bearing the titles of Rawal and Rawat, with five hundred\r\nwar elephants, followed him into the field. The princes of Marwar and\r\nAmber[4.9.4] did him homage, and the Raos of Gwalior Ajmer, Sikri,\r\nRaesen,[4.9.5] Kalpi, Chanderi [300], Bundi, Gagraun, Rampura, and Abu,\r\nserved him as tributaries or held of him in chief.\r\n\r\nSanga did not forget those who sheltered him in his reverses. Karamchand\r\nof Srinagar had a grant of Ajmer and the title of Rao for his son\r\nJagmall, the reward of his services in the reduction of Chanderi.\r\n\r\n=The Administration and Wars of Rāna Sanga.=—In a short space of time,\r\nSanga entirely allayed the disorders occasioned by the intestine feuds\r\nof his family; and were it permitted to speculate on the cause which\r\nprompted a temporary cession of his rights and his dignities to his more\r\nimpetuous brother, it might be discerned in a spirit of forecast, and of\r\nfraternal and patriotic forbearance, a deviation from which would have\r\nendangered the country as well as the safety of his family. We may\r\nassume this, in order to account for an otherwise pusillanimous\r\nsurrender of his birthright, and being in contrast to all the subsequent\r\nheroism of his life, which, when he resigned, was contained within the\r\nwreck of a form. Sanga organized his forces, with which he always kept\r\nthe field, and ere called to contend with the descendant of Timur, he\r\nhad gained eighteen pitched battles against the kings of Delhi and\r\nMalwa. In two of these he was opposed by Ibrahim Lodi in person, at\r\nBakrol and Ghatoli, in which last battle the imperial forces were\r\ndefeated with great slaughter, leaving a prisoner of the blood royal to\r\ngrace the triumph of Chitor. The Pilakhal (yellow rivulet) near Bayana\r\nbecame the northern boundary of Mewar, with the Sind River to the\r\neast,—touching Malwa to the south, while his native hills were an\r\nimpenetrable barrier to the west. Thus swaying, directly or by control,\r\nthe greater part of Rajasthan, and adored by the Rajputs for the\r\npossession of those qualities they hold in estimation, Sanga was\r\nascending to the pinnacle of distinction; and had not fresh hordes of\r\nUsbeks and Tatars from the prolific shores of the Oxus and Jaxartes\r\nagain poured down on the devoted plains of Hindustan, the crown of the\r\nChakravartin[4.9.6] might again have encircled the brow of a Hindu, and\r\nthe banner of supremacy been transferred from Indraprastha to the\r\nbattlements of Chitor. But Babur arrived at a critical time to rally the\r\ndejected followers of the Koran, and to collect them around his own\r\nvictorious standard.\r\n\r\n=Invasions from Central Asia.=—From the earliest recorded periods of her\r\nhistory, India has been the prey of [301] the more hardy population from\r\nthe central regions of Asia. From this fact we may infer another,\r\nnamely, that its internal form of government was the same as at the\r\npresent day, partitioned into numerous petty kingdoms, of tribes and\r\nclans, of a feudal federation, a prey to all the jealousies inseparable\r\nfrom such a condition. The historians of Alexander bear ample testimony\r\nto such form of government, when the Panjab alone possessed many\r\nsovereigns, besides the democracies of cities. The Persians overran it,\r\nand Darius the Mede accounted India the richest of his satrapies. The\r\nGreeks, the Parthians have left in their medals the best proofs of their\r\npower; the Getae or Yuti followed; and from the Ghori Shihabu-d-din to\r\nthe Chagatai Babur, in less than three centuries, five invasions are\r\nrecorded, each originating a dynasty. Sanga’s opponent was the last, and\r\nwill continue so until the rays of knowledge renovate the ancient\r\nnursery of the human race,—then may end the anomaly in the history of\r\npower, of a handful of Britons holding the succession to the Mede, the\r\nParthian, and the Tatar. But, however surprise may be excited at\r\nwitnessing such rapidity of change, from the physical superiority of man\r\nover man, it is immeasurably heightened at the little moral consequence\r\nwhich in every other region of the world has always attended such\r\nconcussions. Creeds have changed, races have mingled, and names have\r\nbeen effaced from the page of history; but in this corner of\r\ncivilization we have no such result, and the Rajput remains the same\r\nsingular being, concentrated in his prejudices, political and moral, as\r\nin the days of Alexander, desiring no change himself, and still less to\r\ncause any in others. Whatever be the conservative principle, it merits a\r\nphilosophic analysis; but more, a proper application and direction, by\r\nthose to whom the destinies of this portion of the globe are confided;\r\nfor in this remote spot there is a nucleus of energy, on which may\r\naccumulate a mass for our support or our destruction.\r\n\r\nTo return: a descendant of the Turushka of the Jaxartes, the ancient foe\r\nof the children of Surya and Chandra, was destined to fulfil the\r\nprophetic Purana which foretold dominion “to the Turushka, the Yavan,”\r\nand other foreign races in Hind; and the conquered made a right\r\napplication of the term Turk, both as regards its ancient and modern\r\nsignification, when applied to the conquerors from Turkistan. Babur, the\r\nopponent of Sanga, was king of Ferghana, and of Turki race. His\r\ndominions were on both sides the Jaxartes, a portion of ancient [302]\r\nSakatai, or Sakadwipa (Scythia), where dwelt Tomyris the Getic queen\r\nimmortalized by Herodotus, and where her opponent erected Cyropolis, as\r\ndid in after-times the Macedonian his most remote Alexandria. From this\r\nregion did the same Getae, Jat, or Yuti, issue, to the destruction of\r\nBactria, two centuries before the Christian era, and also five\r\nsubsequent thereto to found a kingdom in Northern India. Again, one\r\nthousand years later, Babur issued with his bands to the final\r\nsubjugation of India. As affecting India alone, this portion of the\r\nglobe merits deep attention; but as the _officina gentium_, whence\r\nissued those hordes of Asii, Jats, or Yeuts (of whom the Angles were a\r\nbranch), who peopled the shores of the Baltic, and the precursors of\r\nthose Goths who, under Attila and Alaric, altered the condition of\r\nEurope, its importance is vastly enhanced.[4.9.7] But on this occasion\r\nit was not redundant population which made the descendant of Timur and\r\nJenghiz abandon the Jaxartes for the Ganges, but unsuccessful ambition:\r\nfor Babur quitted the delights of Samarkand as a fugitive, and commenced\r\nhis enterprise, which gave him the throne of the Pandus, with less than\r\ntwo thousand adherents.\r\n\r\n=Character of Bābur.=—The Rajput prince had a worthy antagonist in the\r\nking of Ferghana. Like Sanga, he was trained in the school of adversity,\r\nand like him, though his acts of personal heroism were even romantic, he\r\ntempered it with that discretion which looks to its results. In A.D.\r\n1494, at the tender age of twelve, he succeeded to a kingdom; ere he was\r\nsixteen he defeated several confederacies and conquered Samarkand, and\r\nin two short years again lost and regained it. His life was a tissue of\r\nsuccesses and reverses; at one moment hailed lord of the chief kingdoms\r\nof Transoxiana; at another flying, unattended, or putting all to hazard\r\nin desperate single combats, in one of which he slew five champions of\r\nhis enemies. Driven at length from Ferghana, in despair he crossed the\r\nHindu-Kush, and in 1519 the Indus. Between the Panjab and Kabul he\r\nlingered seven years, ere he advanced to measure his sword with Ibrahim\r\nof Delhi. Fortune returned to his standard; Ibrahim was slain, his army\r\nrouted and dispersed, and Delhi and Agra opened their gates to the\r\nfugitive king of Ferghana. His reflections on success evince it was his\r\ndue: “Not to me, O God! but to thee, be the victory!” says the\r\nchivalrous Babur. A year had elapsed in possession of Delhi, ere he\r\nventured against the most powerful of his antagonists, Rana Sanga of\r\nChitor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RUINS OF THE FORTRESS OF BAYĀNA.\r\n  _To face page 352._\r\n]\r\n\r\nWith all Babur’s qualities as a soldier, supported by the hardy clans of\r\nthe ‘cloud mountains’ (_Belut Tagh_) [303] of Karateghin,[4.9.8] the\r\nchances were many that he and they terminated their career on the\r\n‘yellow rivulet’ of Bayana. Neither bravery nor skill saved him from\r\nthis fate, which he appears to have expected. What better proof can be\r\ndesired than Babur’s own testimony to the fact, that a horde of invaders\r\nfrom the Jaxartes, without support or retreat, were obliged to entrench\r\nthemselves to the teeth in the face of their Rajput foe, alike brave and\r\noverpowering in numbers? To ancient jealousies he was indebted for not\r\nlosing his life instead of gaining a crown, and for being extricated\r\nfrom a condition so desperate that even the frenzy of religion, which\r\nmade death martyrdom in “this holy war,” scarcely availed to expel the\r\ndespair which so infected his followers, that in the bitterness of his\r\nheart he says “there was not a single person who uttered a manly word,\r\nnor an individual who delivered a courageous opinion.”\r\n\r\n=The Battle of Khānua, March 16, 1527.=—Babur advanced from Agra and\r\nSikri to oppose Rana Sanga, in full march to attack him at the head of\r\nalmost all the princes of Rajasthan. Although the annals state some\r\npoints which the imperial historian has not recorded, yet both accounts\r\nof the conflict correspond in all the essential details. On the 5th of\r\nKartik, S. 1584[4.9.9] (A.D. 1528), according to the annals, the Rana\r\nraised the siege of Bayana, and at Khanua encountered the advanced guard\r\nof the Tatars, amounting to fifteen hundred men, which was entirely\r\ndestroyed; the fugitives carrying to the main body the accounts of the\r\ndisaster, which paralysed their energies, and made them entrench for\r\nsecurity, instead of advancing with the confidence of victory.\r\nReinforcements met the same fate, and were pursued to the camp.\r\nAccustomed to reverses, Babur met the check without dismay, and adopted\r\nevery precaution [304] that a mind fertile in expedients could suggest\r\nto reassure the drooping spirits of his troops. He threw up\r\nentrenchments, in which he placed his artillery, connecting his guns by\r\nchains, and in the more exposed parts _chevaux de frise_, united by\r\nleather ropes: a precaution continued in every subsequent change of\r\nposition. Everything seemed to aid the Hindu cause: even the Tatar\r\nastrologer asserted that as Mars was in the west, whoever should engage\r\ncoming from the opposite quarter should be defeated. In this state of\r\ntotal inactivity, blockaded in his encampment, Babur remained near a\r\nfortnight, when he determined to renounce his besetting sin, and merit\r\nsuperior aid to extricate himself from his peril: the _naïveté_ of his\r\nvow must be given in his own words.[4.9.10] But the destruction of the\r\nwine flasks would appear only to have added to the existing\r\nconsternation, and made him, as a last resort, appeal to their faith.\r\nHaving addressed them in a speech of [305] manly courage, though\r\nbordering on despair, he seized the happy moment that his exhortation\r\nelicited, to swear them on the Koran to conquer or perish.[4.9.11]\r\nProfiting by this excitement, he broke up his camp, to which he had been\r\nconfined nearly a month, and marched in order of battle to a position\r\ntwo miles in advance, the Rajputs skirmishing up to his guns. Without a\r\nregular circumvallation, his movable pallisadoes and guns chained, he\r\nfelt no security. The inactivity of Sanga can scarcely escape censure,\r\nhowever we may incline to palliate it by supposing that he deemed his\r\nenemy in the toils, and that every day’s delay brought with it increased\r\ndanger to him. Such reasoning would be valid, if the heterogeneous mass\r\nby which the prince of Mewar was surrounded had owned the same patriotic\r\nsentiments as himself: but he ought to have known his countrymen, nor\r\noverlooked the regulating maxim of their ambition, _get land_. Delay was\r\nfatal to this last coalition against the foes of his race. Babur is\r\nsilent on the point to which the annals ascribe their discomfiture, a\r\nnegotiation pending his blockade at Khanua; but these have preserved it,\r\nwith the name of the traitor who sold the cause of his country. The\r\nnegotiation[4.9.12] had reached this point, that on condition of Babur\r\nbeing left Delhi and its dependencies, the Pilakhal at Bayana should be\r\nthe boundary of their respective dominions, and even an annual tribute\r\nwas offered to the Rana [306]. We can believe that in the position Babur\r\nthen was, he would not scruple to promise anything. The chief of Raesen,\r\nby name Salehdi, of the Tuar tribe, was the medium of communication, and\r\nthough the arrangement was negatived, treason had effected the salvation\r\nof Babur.\r\n\r\nOn March 16 the attack commenced by a furious onset on the centre and\r\nright wing of the Tatars, and for several hours the conflict was\r\ntremendous. Devotion was never more manifest on the side of the Rajput,\r\nattested by the long list of noble names amongst the slain as well as\r\nthe bulletin of their foe, whose artillery made dreadful havoc in the\r\nclose ranks of the Rajput cavalry, which could not force the\r\nentrenchments, nor reach the infantry which defended them. While the\r\nbattle was still doubtful, the Tuar traitor who led the van (_harawal_)\r\nwent over to Babur, and Sanga was obliged to retreat from the field,\r\nwhich in the onset promised a glorious victory, himself severely wounded\r\nand the choicest of his chieftains slain: Rawal Udai[4.9.13] Singh of\r\nDungarpur, with two hundred of his clan; Ratna of Salumbar, with three\r\nhundred of his Chondawat kin; Raemall Rathor, son of the prince of\r\nMarwar, with the brave Mertia leaders Khetsi and Ratna; Ramdas the\r\nSonigira Rao; Uja the Jhala; Gokuldas Pramara; Manikchand and\r\nChandrbhan, Chauhan chiefs of the first rank in Mewar; besides a host of\r\ninferior names.[4.9.14] Hasan Khan of Mewat, and a son of the last Lodi\r\nking of Delhi, who coalesced with Sanga, were amongst the\r\nkilled.[4.9.15] Triumphal pyramids were raised of the heads of the\r\nslain, and on a hillock which overlooked the field of battle a tower of\r\nskulls was erected; and the conqueror assumed the title of _Ghazi_,\r\nwhich has ever since been retained by his descendants.\r\n\r\n=The Death of Rāna Sanga.=—Sanga retreated towards the hills of Mewat,\r\nhaving announced his fixed determination never to re-enter Chitor but\r\nwith victory. Had his life been spared to his country, he might have\r\nredeemed the pledge; but the year of his defeat was the last of his\r\nexistence, and he died at Baswa,[4.9.16] on the frontier of Mewat, not\r\nwithout suspicion of poison. It is painful to record the surmise that\r\nhis ministers prompted the deed, and the cause is one which would fix a\r\ndeep stain on the country; namely, the purchase by regicide of\r\ninglorious ease and stipulated safety, in [307] preference to privations\r\nand dangers, and to emulating the manly constancy of their prince, who\r\nresolved to make the heavens his canopy till his foe was crushed—a\r\ndetermination which was pursued with the most resolute perseverance by\r\nsome of his gallant successors.\r\n\r\n=Evils resulting from Polygamy.=—Polygamy is the fertile source of evil,\r\nmoral as well as physical, in the East. It is a relic of barbarism and\r\nprimeval necessity, affording a proof that ancient Asia is still young\r\nin knowledge. The desire of each wife,[4.9.17] that her offspring should\r\nwear a crown, is natural; but they do not always wait the course of\r\nnature for the attainment of their wishes, and the love of power too\r\noften furnishes instruments for any deed, however base. When we see,\r\nshortly after the death of Sanga, the mother of his second son\r\nintriguing with Babur, and bribing him with the surrender of Ranthambhor\r\nand the trophy of victory, the crown of the Malwa king, to supplant the\r\nlawful heir, we can easily suppose she would not have scrupled to remove\r\nany other bar. On this occasion, however, the suspicion rests on the\r\nministers alone. That Babur respected and dreaded his foe we have the\r\nbest proof in his not risking another battle with him; and the blame\r\nwhich he bestows on himself for the slackness of his pursuit after\r\nvictory is honourable to Sanga, who is always mentioned with respect in\r\nthe commentaries of the conqueror: and although he generally styles him\r\nthe Pagan, and dignifies the contest with the title of “the holy war,”\r\nyet he freely acknowledges his merit when he says, “Rana Sanga attained\r\nhis present high eminence by his own valour and his sword.”\r\n\r\n=Appearance of Rāna Sanga.=—Sanga Rana was of the middle stature, but of\r\ngreat muscular strength; fair in complexion, with unusually large eyes,\r\nwhich appear to be peculiar to his descendants.[4.9.18] He exhibited at\r\nhis death but the fragments of a warrior: one eye was lost in the broil\r\nwith his brother; an arm in an action with the Lodi king of Delhi, and\r\nhe was a cripple owing to a limb being broken by a cannon-ball in\r\nanother [308]; while he counted eighty wounds from the sword or the\r\nlance on various parts of his body. He was celebrated for energetic\r\nenterprise, of which his capture of Muzaffar, king of Malwa, in his own\r\ncapital, is a celebrated instance; and his successful storm of the\r\nalmost impregnable Ranthambhor, though ably defended by the imperial\r\ngeneral Ali, gained him great renown. He erected a small palace at\r\nKhanua, on the line which he determined should be the northern limit of\r\nMewar; and had he been succeeded by a prince possessed of his foresight\r\nand judgment, Babur’s descendants might not have retained the\r\nsovereignty of India. A cenotaph long marked the spot where the fire\r\nconsumed the remains of this celebrated prince. Sanga had seven sons, of\r\nwhom the two elder died in non-age. He was succeeded by the third son,\r\n\r\n=Rāna Ratan Singh II., A.D. 1527-31.=—Ratna (S. 1586, A.D. 1530)\r\npossessed all the arrogance and martial virtue of his race. Like his\r\nfather, he determined to make the field his capital, and commanded that\r\nthe gates of Chitor never should be closed, boasting that “its portals\r\nwere Delhi and Mandu.” Had he been spared to temper by experience the\r\nexuberance of youthful impetuosity, he would have well seconded the\r\nresolution of his father, and the league against the enemies of his\r\ncountry and faith. But he was not destined to pass the age always\r\ndangerous to the turbulent and impatient Rajput, ever courting strife if\r\nit would not find him. He had married by stealth the daughter of\r\nPrithiraj of Amber, probably before the death of his elder brothers made\r\nhim heir to Chitor. His double-edged sword, the proxy of the Rajput\r\ncavalier, represented Ratna on this occasion.[4.9.19] Unfortunately it\r\nwas kept but too secret; for the Hara prince of Bundi,[4.9.20] in\r\nignorance of the fact, demanded and obtained her to wife, and carried\r\nher to his capital. The consequences are attributable to the Rana alone,\r\nfor he ought, on coming to the throne, to have espoused her; but his\r\nvanity was flattered at the mysterious transaction, which he deemed\r\nwould prevent all application for the hand of his ‘affianced’ (_manga_).\r\nThe bards of Bundi are rather pleased to record the power of their\r\nprinces, who dared to solicit and obtain the hand of the ‘bride’ of\r\nChitor. The princes of Bundi had long been attached to the Sesodia\r\nhouse: and from the period when their common ancestors fought together\r\non the banks of the Ghaggar against [309] Shihabu-d-din, they had\r\nsilently grown to power under the wing of Mewar, and often proved a\r\nstrong plume in her pinion. The Hara inhabited the hilly tract on her\r\neastern frontier, and though not actually incorporated with Mewar, they\r\nyet paid homage to her princes, bore her ensigns and titles, and in\r\nreturn often poured forth their blood. But at the tribunal of\r\nAnanga,[4.9.21] the Rajput scattered all other homage and allegiance to\r\nthe winds. The maiden of Amber saw no necessity for disclosing her\r\nsecret or refusing the brave Hara, of whom fame spoke loudly, when Ratna\r\ndelayed to redeem his proxy.\r\n\r\n=Death of Rāna Ratan Singh.=—The unintentional offence sank deep into\r\nthe heart of the Rana, and though he was closely connected with the\r\nHara, having married his sister, he brooded on the means of revenge, in\r\nthe attainment of which he sacrificed his own life as well as that of\r\nhis rival. The festival of the Aheria[4.9.22] (the spring hunt), which\r\nhas thrice been fatal to the princes of Mewar, gave the occasion, when\r\nthey fell by each other’s weapons. Though Ratna enjoyed the dignity only\r\nfive years, he had the satisfaction to see the ex-king of Ferghana, now\r\nfounder of the Mogul dynasty of India, leave the scene before him, and\r\nwithout the diminution of an acre of land to Mewar since the fatal day\r\nof Bayana. Rana Ratna was succeeded by his brother,\r\n\r\n=Rāna Bikramajīt, A.D. 1531-35.=—Bikramajit,[4.9.23] in S. 1591 (A.D.\r\n1535). This prince had all the turbulence, without the redeeming\r\nqualities of character, which endeared his brother to his subjects; he\r\nwas insolent, passionate, and vindictive, and utterly regardless of that\r\nrespect which his proud nobles rigidly exacted. Instead of appearing at\r\ntheir head, he passed his time amongst wrestlers and prize-fighters, on\r\nwhom and a multitude of ‘paiks,’ or foot soldiers, he lavished those\r\ngifts and that approbation, to which the aristocratic Rajput, the\r\nequestrian order of Rajasthan, arrogated exclusive right. In this\r\ninnovation he probably imitated his foes, who had learned the\r\nsuperiority of infantry, despised by the Rajput, who, except in sieges,\r\nor when ‘they spread the carpet and hamstrung their steeds,’ held the\r\nfoot-soldier very cheap. The use of artillery was now becoming general,\r\nand the [310] Muslims soon perceived the necessity of foot for their\r\nprotection: but prejudice operated longer upon the Rajput, who still\r\ncurses ‘those vile guns,’ which render of comparatively little value the\r\nlance of many a gallant soldier; and he still prefers falling with\r\ndignity from his steed to descending to an equality with his mercenary\r\nantagonist.\r\n\r\nAn open rupture was the consequence of such innovation, and (to use the\r\nfigurative expression for misrule) ‘Papa Bai ka Raj’[4.9.24] was\r\ntriumphant; the police were despised; the cattle carried off by the\r\nmountaineers from under the walls of Chitor; and when his cavaliers were\r\nordered in pursuit, the Rana was tauntingly told to send his paiks.\r\n\r\n=The Attack by Bahādur, Sultān of Gujarāt.=—Bahadur, sultan of Gujarat,\r\ndetermined to take advantage of the Rajput divisions, to revenge the\r\ndisgrace of the defeat and captivity of his predecessor\r\nMuzaffar.[4.9.25] Reinforced by the troops of Mandu, he marched against\r\nthe Rana, then encamped at Loicha, in the Bundi territory. Though the\r\nforce was overwhelming, yet with the high courage which belonged to his\r\nhouse, Bikramajit did not hesitate to give battle; but he found weak\r\ndefenders in his mercenary paiks, while his vassals and kin not only\r\nkept aloof, but marched off in a body to defend Chitor, and the\r\nposthumous son of Sanga Rana, still an infant.\r\n\r\nThere is a sanctity in the very name of Chitor, which from the earliest\r\ntimes secured her defenders; and now, when threatened again by ‘the\r\nbarbarian,’ such the inexplicable character of the Rajput, we find the\r\nheir of Surajmall abandoning his new capital of Deolia, to pour out the\r\nfew drops which yet circulated in his veins in defence of the abode of\r\nhis fathers.\r\n\r\n‘The son of Bundi,’ with a brave band of five hundred Haras, also came;\r\nas did the Sonigira and Deora Raos of Jalor and Abu, with many\r\nauxiliaries from all parts of Rajwara. This was the most powerful effort\r\nhitherto made by the sultans of Central India, and European\r\nartillerists[4.9.26] are recorded in these [311] annals as brought to\r\nthe subjugation of Chitor. The engineer is styled ‘Labri Khan of\r\nFringan,’ and to his skill Bahadur was indebted for the successful storm\r\nwhich ensued. He sprung a mine at the ‘Bika rock,’ which blew up\r\nforty-five cubits of the rampart, with the bastion where the brave Haras\r\nwere posted. The Bundi bards dwell on this incident, which destroyed\r\ntheir prince and five hundred of his kin. Rao Durga, with the Chondawat\r\nchieftains Sata and Dudu and their vassals, bravely defended the breach\r\nand repelled many assaults; and, to set an example of courageous\r\ndevotion, the queen-mother Jawahir Bai, of Rathor race, clad in armour,\r\nheaded a sally in which she was slain. Still the besiegers gained\r\nground, and the last council convened was to concert means to save the\r\ninfant son of Sanga from this imminent peril.\r\n\r\n=Crowning of a New Rāna.=—But Chitor can only be defended by royalty,\r\nand again they had recourse to the expedient of crowning a king, as a\r\nsacrifice to the dignity of the protecting deity of Chitor. Baghji,\r\nprince of Deolia, courted the insignia of destruction; the banner of\r\nMewar floated over him, and the golden sun from its sable field never\r\nshone more refulgent than when the _changi_[4.9.27] was raised amidst\r\nthe shouts of her defenders over the head of the son of Surajmall.\r\n\r\n=The Johar.=—The infant, Udai Singh, was placed in safety with Surthan,\r\nprince of Bundi,[4.9.28] the garrison put on their saffron robes, while\r\nmaterials for the _johar_ were preparing. There was little time for the\r\npyre. The bravest had fallen in defending the breach, now completely\r\nexposed. Combustibles were quickly heaped up in reservoirs and magazines\r\nexcavated in the rock, under which gunpowder was strewed. Karnavati,\r\nmother of the prince, and sister to the gallant Arjun Hara, led the\r\nprocession of willing victims to their doom, and thirteen thousand\r\nfemales were thus swept at once from the record of life. The gates were\r\nthrown open, and the Deolia chief, at the head of the survivors, with a\r\nblind and impotent despair, rushed on his fate [312].\r\n\r\nBahadur must have been appalled at the horrid sight on viewing his\r\nconquest;[4.9.29] the mangled bodies of the slain, with hundreds in the\r\nlast agonies from the poniard or poison, awaiting death as less dreadful\r\nthan dishonour and captivity.[4.9.30] To use the emphatic words of the\r\nannalist, “the last day of Chitor had arrived.” Every clan lost its\r\nchief, and the choicest of their retainers; during the siege and in the\r\nstorm thirty-two thousand Rajputs were slain. This is the second _sakha_\r\nof Chitor.\r\n\r\nBahadur had remained but a fortnight, when the tardy advance of Humayun\r\nwith his succours warned him to retire.[4.9.31] According to the annals,\r\nhe left Bengal at the solicitation of the queen Karnavati; but instead\r\nof following up the spoil-encumbered foe, he commenced a pedantic war of\r\nwords with Bahadur, punning on the word ‘Chitor.’ Had Humayun not been\r\nso distant, this catastrophe would have been averted, for he was bound\r\nby the laws of chivalry, the claims of which he had acknowledged, to\r\ndefend the queen’s cause, whose knight he had become. The relation of\r\nthe peculiarity of a custom analogous to the taste of the chivalrous age\r\nof Europe may amuse. When her Amazonian sister the Rathor queen was\r\nslain, the mother of the infant prince took a surer method to shield him\r\nin demanding the fulfilment of the pledge given by Humayun when she sent\r\nthe Rakhi to that monarch.\r\n\r\n=The Rākhi.=—‘The festival of the bracelet’ (_Rakhi_) is in spring, and\r\nwhatever its origin, it is one of the few when an intercourse of\r\ngallantry of the most delicate nature is established between the fair\r\nsex and the cavaliers of Rajasthan. Though the bracelet may be sent by\r\nmaidens, it is only on occasions of urgent necessity or danger. The\r\nRajput dame bestows with the Rakhi the title of adopted brother; and\r\nwhile its acceptance secures to her all the protection of a _cavalière\r\nservente_, scandal itself never suggests any other tie to his devotion.\r\nHe may hazard his life in her cause, and yet never receive a smile in\r\nreward, for he cannot even see the fair object who, as brother of her\r\nadoption, has constituted him her defender. But there is a charm in the\r\nmystery of such connexion, never endangered by close observation, and\r\nthe loyal to the fair may well attach a value [313] to the public\r\nrecognition of being the Rakhi-band Bhai, the ‘bracelet-bound brother’\r\nof a princess. The intrinsic value of such pledge is never looked to,\r\nnor is it requisite it should be costly, though it varies with the means\r\nand rank of the donor, and may be of flock silk and spangles, or gold\r\nchains and gems. The acceptance of the pledge and its return is by the\r\n_kachhli_, or corset, of simple silk or satin, of gold brocade and\r\npearls. In shape or application there is nothing similar in Europe, and\r\nas defending the most delicate part of the structure of the fair, it is\r\npeculiarly appropriate as an emblem of devotion. A whole province has\r\noften accompanied the Kachhli, and the monarch of India was so pleased\r\nwith this courteous delicacy in the customs of Rajasthan, on receiving\r\nthe bracelet of the princess Karnavati, which invested him with the\r\ntitle of her brother, and uncle and protector to her infant Udai Singh,\r\nthat he pledged himself to her service, “even if the demand were the\r\ncastle of Ranthambhor.” Humayun proved himself a true knight, and even\r\nabandoned his conquests in Bengal when called on to redeem his pledge\r\nand succour Chitor, and the widows and minor sons of Sanga Rana.[4.9.32]\r\nHumayun had the highest proofs of the worth of those courting his\r\nprotection; he was with his father Babur in all his wars in India, and\r\nat the battle of Bayana his prowess was conspicuous, and is recorded by\r\nBabur’s own pen. He amply fulfilled his pledge, expelled the foe from\r\nChitor, took Mandu by assault, and, as some revenge for her king’s\r\naiding the king of Gujarat, he sent for the Rana Bikramajit, whom,\r\nfollowing their own notions of investiture, he girt with a sword in the\r\ncaptured citadel of his foe.[4.9.33]\r\n\r\nThe Muhammadan historians, strangers to their customs, or the secret\r\nmotives which caused the emperor to abandon Bengal, ascribe it to the\r\nRana’s solicitation; but we may credit the annals, which are in unison\r\nwith the chivalrous notions of the Rajputs, into which succeeding\r\nmonarchs, the great Akbar, his son [314] Jahangir, and Shah Jahan,\r\nentered with delight; and even Aurangzeb, two of whose original letters\r\nto the queen-mother of Udaipur are now in the author’s possession, and\r\nare remarkable for their elegance and purity of diction, and couched in\r\nterms perfectly accordant with Rajput delicacy.[4.9.34]\r\n\r\n=Restoration of Bikramajīt.=—Bikramajit, thus restored to his capital,\r\nhad gained nothing by adversity; or, to employ the words of the\r\nannalist, “experience had yielded no wisdom.” He renewed all his former\r\ninsolence to his chiefs, and so entirely threw aside his own dignity,\r\nand, what is of still greater consequence, the reverence universally\r\nshown to old age, as to strike in open court Karamchand of Ajmer, the\r\nprotector of his father Sanga in his misfortunes. The assembly rose with\r\none accord at this indignity to their order; and as they retired, the\r\nChondawat leader Kanji, the first of the nobles, exclaimed, “Hitherto,\r\nbrother chiefs, we have had but a smell of the blossom, but now we shall\r\nbe obliged to eat the fruit”; to which the insulted Pramara added, as he\r\nhastily retired, “To-morrow its flavour will be known.”\r\n\r\nThough the Rajput looks up to his sovereign as to a divinity, and is\r\nenjoined implicit obedience by his religion, which rewards him\r\naccordingly hereafter, yet this doctrine has its limits, and precedents\r\nare abundant for deposal, when the acts of the prince may endanger the\r\nrealm. But there is a bond of love as well as of awe which restrains\r\nthem, and softens its severity in the paternity of sway; for these\r\nprinces are at once the father and king of their people: not in fiction,\r\nbut reality—for he is the representative of the common ancestor of the\r\naristocracy—the sole lawgiver of Rajasthan.\r\n\r\n=Death of Rāna Bikramajīt.=—Sick of these minors (and they had now a\r\nthird in prospect), which in a few years had laid prostrate the throne\r\nof Mewar, her nobles on leaving their unworthy prince repaired to\r\nBanbir, the natural son of the heroic Prithiraj, and offered “to seat\r\nhim on the throne of Chitor.” He had the virtue to resist the\r\nsolicitation; and it was only on painting the dangers which threatened\r\nthe country, if its chief at such a period had not their confidence,\r\nthat he gave his consent. The step between the deposal and death of a\r\nking is necessarily short [315], and the cries of the females, which\r\nannounced the end of Bikramajit, were drowned in the acclamations raised\r\non the elevation of the _changi_ over the head of the bastard Banbir.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.8.1:\r\n\r\n  [The dates given in the margin are based on recently found\r\n  inscriptions (Har Bilas Sarda, _Maharana Kumbha: Sovereign, Soldier,\r\n  Scholar_, Ajmer, 1917, p. 2).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.8.2:\r\n\r\n  The _Raj Ratana_, by Ranchhor Bhat, says: “The Mandor Rao was pardhan,\r\n  or premier to Mokal, and conquered Nawa and Didwana for Mewar.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.8.3:\r\n\r\n  [It is the generosity of Rāna Sanga to Muzaffar Shāh of which Abu-l\r\n  Fazl speaks (_Āīn_, ii. 221).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.8.4:\r\n\r\n  [The Musalmān historians give a different account.

An intriguing Brahman, who managed the estates of\r\n  the Rana’s eldest sister, held also the twofold office of physician\r\n  and astrologer to the Rana. He had predicted that year as one of evil\r\n  in his horoscope, and was about to verify the prophecy, since, instead\r\n  of the active medicines requisite, he was administering the _Haft\r\n  dhat_, or ‘seven metals,’ compounded. Having a most sincere regard for\r\n  the Rana’s welfare, the author seized the opportunity of a full court\r\n  being assembled on the distribution of swords and coco-nuts\r\n  preparatory to the military festival, to ask a personal favour. The\r\n  Rana, smiling, said that it was granted, when he was entreated to\r\n  leave off the poison he was taking. He did so; the amendment was soon\r\n  visible, and, aided by the medicines of Dr. Duncan, which he readily\r\n  took, his complaint was speedily cured.

The king of Ferghana, like Caesar, was the historian of his\r\n  own conquests, and unites all the qualities of the romantic troubadour\r\n  to those of the warrior and statesman. It is not saying too much when\r\n  it is asserted, that Mr. Erskine is the only person existing who could\r\n  have made such a translation, or preserved the great charm of the\r\n  original—its elevated simplicity; and though his modesty makes him\r\n  share the merit with Dr. Leyden, it is to him the public thanks are\r\n  due. Mr. Erskine’s introduction is such as might have been expected\r\n  from his well-known erudition and research, and with the notes\r\n  interspersed adds immensely to the value of the original. [A new\r\n  translation by Mrs. Beveridge is in course of publication.] With his\r\n  geographical materials, those of Mr. Elphinstone, and the journal of\r\n  the _Voyage d’Orenbourg à Bokhara_, full of merit and modesty, we now\r\n  possess sufficient materials for the geography of the nursery of\r\n  mankind. I would presume to amend one valuable geographical notice\r\n  (Introd. p. 27), and which only requires the permutation of a vowel,\r\n  Kas-_mer_ for Kas-_mir_; when we have, not ‘the country of the Kas,’\r\n  but the _Kasia Montes_ (mer) of Ptolemy: the Kho (_mer_) Kas, or\r\n  _Caucasus_. _Mir_ has no signification, _Mer_ is ‘mountain’ in\r\n  Sanskrit, as is _Kho_ in Persian.

Having sent for the gold and silver goblets and cups, with\r\n  all the other utensils used for drinking parties, I directed them to\r\n  be broken, and renounced the use of wine, purifying my mind. The\r\n  fragments of the goblets and other utensils of gold and silver I\r\n  directed to be divided among derwishes and the poor. The first person\r\n  who followed me in my repentance was Asas, who also accompanied me in\r\n  my resolution of ceasing to cut the beard, and of allowing it to grow.\r\n  That night and the following, numbers of Amirs and courtiers,\r\n  soldiers, and persons not in the service, to the number of nearly\r\n  three hundred men, made vows of reformation. The wine which we had\r\n  with us we poured on the ground. I ordered that the wine brought by\r\n  Baba Dost should have salt thrown into it, that it might be made into\r\n  vinegar. On the spot where the wine had been poured out I directed a\r\n  wāīn to be sunk and built of stone, and close by the wāīn an almshouse\r\n  to be erected. In the month of Moharrem in the year 935, when I went\r\n  to visit Gualiar, in my way from Dholpur to Sikri, I found this wāīn\r\n  completed. I had previously made a vow, that if I gained the victory\r\n  over Rana Sanka the Pagan, I would remit the Temgha (or stamp-tax)\r\n  levied from Musulmans. At the time when I made my vow of penitence,\r\n  Derwish Muhammed Sarban and Sheikh Zin put me in mind of my promise. I\r\n  said, ‘You did right to remind me of this: I renounce the temgha in\r\n  all my dominions, so far as concerns Musulmans’; and I sent for my\r\n  secretaries, and desired them to write and send to all my dominions\r\n  firmans conveying intelligence of the two important incidents that had\r\n  occurred\" (_Memoirs of Baber_, p. 354). [Elliot-Dowson iv. 269.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.9.11:\r\n\r\n  \"At this time, as I have already observed, in consequence of preceding\r\n  events, a general consternation and alarm prevailed among great and\r\n  small. There was not a single person who uttered a manly word, nor an\r\n  individual who delivered a courageous opinion. The Vazirs, whose duty\r\n  it was to give good counsel, and the Amirs, who enjoyed the wealth of\r\n  kingdoms, neither spoke bravely, nor was their counsel or deportment\r\n  such as became men of firmness. During the whole course of this\r\n  expedition, Khalifeh conducted himself admirably, and was unremitting\r\n  and indefatigable in his endeavours to put everything in the best\r\n  order. At length, observing the universal discouragement of my troops,\r\n  and their total want of spirit, I formed my plan. I called an assembly\r\n  of all the Amirs and officers, and addressed them: ‘Noblemen and\r\n  soldiers! Every man that comes into the world is subject to\r\n  dissolution. When we are passed away and gone, God only survives,\r\n  unchangeable. Whoever comes to the feast of life must, before it is\r\n  over, drink from the cup of death. He who arrives at the inn of\r\n  mortality must one day inevitably take his departure from that house\r\n  of sorrow, the world. How much better it is to die with honour than to\r\n  live with infamy!\r\n\r\n               \"‘With fame, even if I die, I am contented;\r\n               Let fame be mine, since my body is death’s.\r\n\r\n  \"‘The most high God has been propitious to us, and has now placed us\r\n  in such a crisis, that if we fall in the field we die the death of\r\n  martyrs; if we survive, we rise victorious, the avengers of the cause\r\n  of God. Let us, then, with one accord, swear on God’s holy word, that\r\n  none of us will even think of turning his face from this warfare, nor\r\n  desert from the battle and slaughter that ensues, till his soul is\r\n  separated from his body.’\r\n\r\n  “Master and servant, small and great, all with emulation, seizing the\r\n  blessed Koran in their hands, swore in the form that I had given.

The poet also repeatedly speaks of “the volcano of the\r\n  field,” giving to understand great guns; but these may be\r\n  interpolations, though I would not check a full investigation of so\r\n  curious a subject by raising a doubt. Babur was the first who\r\n  introduced field guns in the Muhammadan wars, and Bahadur’s invasion\r\n  is the first notice of their application in sieges, for in\r\n  Alau-d-din’s time, in the thirteenth century, he used the catapult or\r\n  battering-ram, called manjanik. To these guns Babur was indebted for\r\n  victory over the united cavalry of Rajasthan. They were served by Rumi\r\n  Khan, probably a Roumeliot, or Syrian Christian. The Franks\r\n  (Faringis), with Bahadur, must have been some of Vasco di Gama’s crew.\r\n  [For the use of artillery in Mogul times see the full account by\r\n  Irvine (_Army of the Indian Moghuls_, 113 ff.).

The greatest\r\n  reward he could, and the only one he would, receive, was the courteous\r\n  civility displayed in many of these interesting customs. He was the\r\n  Rakhi-band Bhai of, and received ‘the bracelet’ from, three queens of\r\n  Udaipur, Bundi, and Kotah, besides Chand Bai, the maiden sister of the\r\n  Rana; as well as many ladies of the chieftains of rank, with whom he\r\n  interchanged letters.

Whether this was the\r\nintention of the nobles who set aside the unworthy son of Sanga, there\r\nis abundant reason to doubt; and as he is subsequently branded with the\r\nepithet of ‘usurper’ it was probably limited, though unexpressed, to\r\ninvesting him with the executive authority during the minority of Udai\r\nSingh. Banbir, however, only awaited the approach of night to remove\r\nwith his own hands the obstacle to his ambition.\r\n\r\n=The Escape of Udai Singh, the Heir.=—Udai Singh was about six years of\r\nage. “He had gone to sleep after his rice and milk,” when his nurse was\r\nalarmed by screams from the rawala,[4.10.1] and the Bari[4.10.2] coming\r\nin to take away the remains of the dinner, informed her of the cause,\r\nthe assassination of the Rana. Aware that one murder was the precursor\r\nof another, the faithful nurse put her charge into a fruit basket and,\r\ncovering it with leaves, she delivered it to the Bari, enjoining him to\r\nescape with it from the fort. Scarcely had she time to substitute her\r\nown infant in the room of the prince, when Banbir, entering, inquired\r\nfor him. Her lips refused their office; she pointed to the cradle, and\r\nbeheld the murderous steel buried in the heart of her babe [316]. The\r\nlittle victim to fidelity was burnt amidst the tears of the rawala, the\r\ninconsolable household of their late sovereign, who supposed that their\r\ngrief was given to the last pledge of the illustrious Sanga. The nurse\r\n(_Dhai_) was a Rajputni of the Khichi tribe, her name Panna, or ‘the\r\nDiamond.’ Having consecrated with her tears the ashes of her child, she\r\nhastened after that she had preserved. But well had it been for Mewar\r\nhad the poniard fulfilled its intention, and had the annals never\r\nrecorded the name of Udai Singh in the catalogue of her princes.\r\n\r\nThe faithful barber was awaiting the nurse in the bed of the Berach\r\nRiver, some miles west of Chitor, and fortunately the infant had not\r\nawoke until he descended the city. They departed for Deolia, and sought\r\nrefuge with Singh Rao, the successor to Baghji, who fell for Chitor; who\r\ndreading the consequence of detection, they proceeded to Dungarpur.\r\nRawal Askaran then ruled this principality, which, as well as Deolia,\r\nwas not only a branch, but the elder branch, of Chitor. With every wish\r\nto afford a shelter, he pleaded the danger which threatened himself and\r\nthe child in such a feeble sanctuary. Pursuing a circuitous route\r\nthrough Idar, and the intricate valleys of the Aravalli, by the help and\r\nwith the protection of its wild inmates, the Bhils, she gained\r\nKumbhalmer. The resolution she had formed was bold as it was judicious.\r\nShe demanded an interview with the governor, Asa Sah his name, of the\r\nmercantile tribe of Depra,[4.10.3] and a follower of the theistical\r\ntenets of the Jains. The interview being granted, she placed the infant\r\nin his lap, and bid him “guard the life of his sovereign.” He felt\r\nperplexed and alarmed: but his mother, who was present, upbraided him\r\nfor his scruples. “Fidelity,” said she, “never looks at dangers or\r\ndifficulties. He is your master, the son of Sanga, and by God’s blessing\r\nthe result will be glorious.” Having thus fulfilled her trust, the\r\nfaithful Panna withdrew from Kumbhalmer to avoid the suspicion which a\r\nRajputni about a Srawak’s[4.10.4] child would have occasioned, as the\r\nheir of Chitor was declared to be the nephew of the Depra.\r\n\r\n=The Boyhood of Udai Singh.=—Suspicions were often excited regarding\r\nAsa’s nephew; once, especially, on the anniversary (_samvatsara_) of the\r\ngovernor’s father, when “the Rajput guests being in one rank, and the\r\nmen of wealth in another, young Udai seized a vessel of curds, which no\r\nintreaty could prevail on him to relinquish, deriding their threats”\r\n[317]. Seven years elapsed before the secret transpired; at length\r\nself-revealed, from the same independent bearing. On occasion of a visit\r\nfrom the Sonigira chief, Udai was sent to receive him, and the dignified\r\nmanner in which he performed the duty convinced the chief ‘he was no\r\nnephew to the Sah.’ Rumour spread the tale, and brought not only the\r\nnobles of Mewar, but adjacent chiefs, to hail the son of Sanga Rana.\r\nSahidas of Salumbar, the representative of Chonda, Jaga of Kelwa, Sanga\r\nof Bagor, all chiefs of the clans of Chondawat; the Chauhans of Kotharia\r\nand Bedla, the Pramar of Bijolia Akhiraj (Sonigira), Prithiraj of\r\nSanchor, and Lunkaran Jethawat, repaired to Kumbhalmer, when all doubt\r\nwas removed by the testimony of the nurse, and of her coadjutor in the\r\npreservation of the child.\r\n\r\n=Installation of Rāna Udai Singh, A.D. 1537-72.=—A court was formed,\r\nwhen the faithful Asa Sah resigned his trust and placed the prince of\r\nChitor ‘in the lap of the Kotharia Chauhan,’ as the ‘great\r\nancient’[4.10.5] among the nobles of Mewar, who was throughout\r\nacquainted with the secret, and who, to dissipate the remaining scruples\r\nwhich attached to the infant’s preservation, ‘ate off the same platter\r\nwith him.’ The Sonigira Rao did not hesitate to affiance to him his\r\ndaughter, and it was accepted by his advisers, notwithstanding the\r\ninterdict of Hamir to any intermarriage with the Sonigira, since the\r\ninsult of giving the widow to his bed. Udai received the tika of Chitor\r\nin the castle of Kumbha, and the homage of nearly all the chiefs of\r\nMewar.\r\n\r\nThe tidings soon reached the usurper, who had not borne his faculties\r\nmeekly since his advancement; but having seized on the dignity, he\r\nwished to ape all the customs of the legitimate monarchs of Chitor, and\r\neven had the effrontery to punish as an insult the refusal of one of the\r\nproud sons of Chonda to take the _dauna_ from his bastard hand.\r\n\r\n=The Dauna, a Recognition of Legitimacy.=—The _dauna_, or _daua_, is a\r\nportion of the dish of which the prince partakes, sent by his own hand\r\nto whomsoever he honours at the banquet. At the rasora, or refectory,\r\nthe chiefs who are admitted to dine in the presence of their sovereign\r\nare seated according to their rank. The repast is one of those occasions\r\nwhen an easy familiarity is permitted, which, though unrestrained, never\r\nexceeds the bounds [318] of etiquette, and the habitual reverence due to\r\ntheir father and prince. When he sends, by the steward of the kitchen, a\r\nportion of the dish before him, or a little from his own _kansa_, or\r\nplate, all eyes are guided to the favoured mortal, whose good fortune is\r\nthe subject of subsequent conversation. Though, with the diminished\r\nlustre of this house, the _dauna_ may have lost its former estimation,\r\nit is yet received with reverence; but the extent of this feeling, even\r\nso late as the reign of Arsi Rana, the father of the reigning prince,\r\nthe following anecdote will testify. In the rebellion during this\r\nprince’s reign, amongst the ancient customs which became relaxed, that\r\nof bestowing the _dauna_ was included; and the Rana conferring it on the\r\nRathor prince of Kishangarh, the Bijolia chief, one of the sixteen\r\nsuperior nobles of Mewar, rose and left the presence, observing,\r\n“Neither the Kachhwaha nor the Rathor has a right to this honour, nor\r\ncan we, who regard as sanctified even the leavings of your repast,\r\nwitness this degradation; for the Thakur of Kishangarh is far beneath\r\nme.” To such extent is this privilege even yet carried, and such\r\nimportance is attached from habit to the personal character of the\r\nprinces of Mewar, that the test of regal legitimacy in Rajasthan is\r\nadmission to eat from the same plate (_kansa_) with the Rana: and to the\r\nrefusal of this honour to the great Man Singh of Amber may be indirectly\r\nascribed the ruin of Mewar.[4.10.6]\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be conceived with what contempt the haughty nobility of\r\nChitor received the mockery of honour from the hand of this ‘fifth son\r\nof Mewar’; and the Chondawat chief had the boldness to add to his\r\nrefusal, “that an honour from the hand of a true son of Bappa Rawal\r\nbecame a disgrace when proffered by the offspring of the handmaid\r\nSitalseni.” The defection soon became general, and all repaired to the\r\nvalley of Kumbhalmer to hail the legitimate son of Mewar. A caravan of\r\nfive hundred horses and ten thousand oxen, laden with merchandise from\r\nCutch, the dower of Banbir’s daughter, guarded by one thousand Gaharwar\r\nRajputs, was plundered in the passes: a signal intimation of the decay\r\nof his authority, and a timely supply to the celebration of the nuptials\r\nof Udai Rana with the daughter of the Rao of Jalor. Though the interdict\r\nof Hamir was not forgotten, it was deemed that the insult given by\r\nBanbir Sonigira was amply effaced by his successor’s redemption of the\r\nusurpation of Banbir Sesodia. The marriage was solemnized at Bali,\r\nwithin the limits of Jalor, and the [319] customary offerings were sent\r\nor given by all the princes of Rajasthan. Two chiefs only, of any\r\nconsequence, abstained from attending on their lawful prince on this\r\noccasion, the Solanki of Maholi and Maloji of Tana. In attacking them,\r\nthe bastard was brought into conflict; but Maloji was slain and the\r\nSolanki surrendered.\r\n\r\n=Deposition of Rāna Banbīr Singh.=—Deserted by all, Banbir held out in\r\nthe capital; but his minister admitted, under the garb of a\r\nreinforcement with supplies, a thousand resolute adherents of the\r\nprince: the keepers of the gates were surprised and slain, and the _an_\r\nof Udai Singh was proclaimed. Banbir was even permitted to retire with\r\nhis family and his wealth. He sought refuge in the Deccan, and the\r\nBhonslas of Nagpur are said to derive their origin from this spurious\r\nbranch of Chitor.[4.10.7]\r\n\r\n=Rāna Udai Singh, A.D. 1537-72.=—Rana Udai Singh ascended the throne in\r\nS. 1597 (A.D. 1541-2). Great were the rejoicings on the restoration of\r\nthis prince. ‘The song of joy,’[4.10.8] which was composed on the\r\noccasion, is yet a favourite at Udaipur, and on the festival of Isani\r\n(the Ceres of Rajasthan), the females still chant in chorus the\r\n‘farewell to Kumbhalmer.’[4.10.9] But the evil days of Mewar which set\r\nin with Sanga’s death, and were accelerated by the fiery valour of Ratna\r\nand the capricious conduct of Bikramajit, were completed by an anomaly\r\nin her annals: a coward succeeding a bastard to guide the destinies of\r\nthe Sesodias. The vices of Ratna and his brother were virtues compared\r\nto this physical defect, the consequences of which destroyed a great\r\nnational feeling, the opinion of its invincibility.\r\n\r\n=His Character.=—“Woe to the land where a minor rules or a woman bears\r\nsway!” exclaims the last of the great bards[4.10.10] of Rajasthan; but\r\nwhere both were united, as in Mewar, the measure of her griefs was full.\r\nUdai Singh had not one quality of a sovereign; and wanting martial\r\nvirtue, the common heritage of his race, he was destitute of all. Yet he\r\nmight have slumbered life away in inglorious repose during the reign of\r\nHumayun, or the contentions of the Pathan usurpation; but, unhappily for\r\nRajasthan, a prince was then rearing who forged fetters for the Hindu\r\nrace which enthralled them for ages; and though the corroding hand of\r\ntime left but their fragments, yet even now, though emancipated, they\r\nbear the indelible marks of the manacle; not like the galley slave’s,\r\nphysical and exterior, but deep mental scars, never to be effaced. Can a\r\nnation which has run its long career of glory be [320] regenerated? Can\r\nthe soul of the Greek or the Rajput be reanimated with the spark divine\r\nwhich defended the kunguras[4.10.11] of Chitor or the pass of\r\nThermopylae? Let history answer the question.\r\n\r\n=Birth of Akbar.=—In the same year that the song of joy was raised in\r\nthe cloud-capped[4.10.12] palace of Kumbhalmer for the deliverance of\r\nUdai Singh, the note of woe was pealed through the walls of Umarkot, and\r\ngiven to the winds of the desert, to proclaim the birth[4.10.13] of an\r\ninfant destined to be the greatest monarch who ever swayed the sceptre\r\nof Hindustan. In an oasis of the Indian desert, amidst the descendants\r\nof the ancient Sogdoi[4.10.14] of Alexander, Akbar first saw the light;\r\nhis father a fugitive, the diadem torn from his brows, its recovery more\r\nimprobable than was its acquisition by Babur. The ten years which had\r\nelapsed since Humayun’s accession were passed in perpetual strife with\r\nhis brothers, placed according to custom in subordinate governments.\r\nTheir selfish ambition met its reward; for with the fall of Humayun\r\ntheir own was ensured, when Sher Shah displaced the dynasty of Chagatai\r\nfor his own, the Pathan (or Sur).\r\n\r\n=Defeat and Flight of Humāyūn, A.D. 1540.=—From the field of battle at\r\nKanauj, where Humayun left his crown, his energetic opponent gave him no\r\nrespite, driving him before him from Agra to Lahore. Thence, with his\r\nfamily and a small band of adherents, alternately protected and repelled\r\nby Hindu chieftains, he reached the valley of Sind, where he struggled\r\nto maintain himself amidst the greatest privations, attempting in\r\nsuccession each stronghold on the Indus, from Multan to the ocean.\r\nFoiled in every object, his associates made rebels by distress, he\r\nabandoned them for the more dubious shelter of the foes of his race.\r\nVain were his solicitations to Jaisalmer and Jodhpur; and though it\r\ncannot be matter of wonder that he found no commiseration from either\r\nBhatti or Rathor, we must reprobate the unnational conduct of Maldeo,\r\nwho, the Mogul historian says, attempted to make him captive. From such\r\ninhospitable treatment the royal exile escaped by again plunging into\r\nthe desert, where he encountered, along with the tender objects of his\r\nsolicitude, hardships of the most appalling description, until sheltered\r\nby the Sodha prince of Umarkot. The high courage and the virtues of this\r\nmonarch increase that interest in his sufferings which royalty in\r\ndistress never fails to awaken by its irresistible influence [321] upon\r\nour sympathies; and they form an affecting episode in the history of\r\nFerishta.[4.10.15] Humayun, though more deeply skilled in the mysteries\r\nof astrology than any professed seer of his empire, appears never to\r\nhave enjoyed that prescience which, according to the initiated in the\r\nscience, is to be obtained from accurate observation:\r\n\r\n              And coming events cast their shadows before;\r\n\r\nfor, could he, by any prophetic power, have foreseen that the cloud\r\nwhich then shaded his fortunes, was but the precursor of glory to his\r\nrace, he would have continued his retreat from the sheltering sand-hills\r\nof Umarkot with very different sentiments from those which accompanied\r\nhis flight into Persia [322].\r\n\r\n=Early Years of Akbar.=—Humayun educated the young Akbar in the same\r\nschool of adversity in which he had studied under Babur. Between the\r\nPersian court and his ancient patrimony in Transoxiana, Kandahar, and\r\nKashmir, twelve years were passed in every trial of fortune. During this\r\nshort period, India, always the prize of valour, had witnessed in\r\nsuccession six[4.10.16] kings descended from the Pathan ‘Lion’ (_sher_),\r\nof whom the last, Sikandar, was involved in the same civil broils which\r\nbrought the crown to his family. Humayun, then near Kashmir, no sooner\r\nobserved the tide of events set counter to his foe, than he crossed the\r\nIndus and advanced upon Sirhind, where the Pathan soon appeared with a\r\ntumultuous array. The impetuosity of young Akbar brought on a general\r\nengagement, which the veterans deemed madness. Not so Humayun, who gave\r\nthe command to his boy, whose heroism so excited all ranks, that they\r\ndespised the numbers of the enemy, and gained a glorious victory. This\r\nwas the presage of his future fame; for Akbar was then but twelve years\r\nof age,[4.10.17] the same period of life at which his grandfather,\r\nBabur, maintained himself on the throne of Farghana. Humayun, worthy of\r\nsuch a son and such a sire, entered Delhi in triumph; but he did not\r\nlong enjoy his recovered crown. His death will appear extraordinary,\r\naccording to the erroneous estimate formed of Eastern princes: its cause\r\nwas a fall from the terrace of his library;[4.10.18] for, like every\r\nindividual of his race, he was not merely a patron of literature, but\r\nhimself a scholar. Were we to contrast the literary acquirements of the\r\nChagatai princes with those of their contemporaries of Europe, the\r\nbalance of lore would be found on the side of the Asiatics, even though\r\nElizabeth and Henry IV. of France were in the scale. Amongst the princes\r\nfrom the Jaxartes are historians, poets, astronomers, founders of\r\nsystems of government and religion, warriors, and great captains, who\r\nclaim our respect and admiration.\r\n\r\n=Akbar’s Struggle for the Empire.=—Scarcely had Akbar been seated on the\r\nthrone, when Delhi and Agra were wrested from him, and a nook of the\r\nPanjab constituted all his empire: but by the energetic valour of the\r\ngreat Bairam Khan, his lost sovereignty was regained with equal\r\nrapidity, and established by the wisdom of this Sully[4.10.19] of\r\nHindustan on a rock. Kalpi, Chanderi, Kalanjar, all Bundelkhand and\r\nMalwa, were soon attached to the empire, and at the early age of\r\neighteen Akbar assumed the uncontrolled [323] direction of the State. He\r\nsoon turned his attention towards the Rajputs; and whether it was to\r\nrevenge the inhospitality of Maldeo towards his father, he advanced\r\nagainst the Rathors, and stormed and took Merta, the second city in\r\nMarwar. Raja Biharimall [or Bahar Mall] of Amber anticipated the king,\r\nenrolled himself and son Bhagwandas amongst his vassals, gave the\r\nChagatai a daughter to wife, and held his country as a fief of the\r\nempire. But the rebellions of the Usbek nobles, and the attempts of\r\nformer princes to regain their lost power, checked for a time his\r\ndesigns upon Rajasthan. These matters adjusted, and the petty sovereigns\r\nin the East (to whom the present monarch of Oudh is as Alexander)\r\nsubjected to authority, he readily seized upon the provocation which the\r\nsanctuary given to Baz Bahadur of Malwa and the ex-prince of Narwar\r\nafforded, to turn his arms against Chitor.[4.10.20]\r\n\r\n=Comparison of Akbar with Rāna Udai Singh.=—Happy the country where the\r\nsovereignty is in the laws, and where the monarch is but the chief\r\nmagistrate of the State, unsubjected to those vicissitudes which make\r\nthe sceptre in Asia unstable as a pendulum, kept in perpetual\r\noscillation by the individual passions of her princes; where the virtues\r\nof one will exalt her to the summit of prosperity, as the vices of a\r\nsuccessor will plunge her into the abyss of degradation. Akbar and Udai\r\nSingh furnish the corollary to this self-evident truth.\r\n\r\nThe Rana was old enough to philosophize on ‘the uses of adversity’; and\r\nthough the best of the ‘great ancients’ had fallen in defence of Chitor,\r\nthere were not wanting individuals capable of instilling just and noble\r\nsentiments into his mind: but it was of that common character which is\r\nformed to be controlled by others; and an artful and daring concubine\r\nstepped in, to govern Udai Singh and Mewar.\r\n\r\nAkbar was not older when he came to the throne[4.10.21] of Delhi than\r\nUdai Singh when he ascended that of Mewar. Nor were his hopes much\r\nbrighter; but the star which beamed upon his cradle in the desert,\r\nconducted to his aid such counsellors as the magnanimous Bairam, and the\r\nwise and virtuous Abu-l Fazl. Yet it may be deemed hardly fair to\r\ncontrast the Rajput with the Mogul: the one disciplined into an accurate\r\nknowledge of human nature, by experience of the [324] mutability of\r\nfortune; the other cooped up from infancy in a valley of his native\r\nhills, his birth concealed, and his education restricted.[4.10.22]\r\n\r\nAkbar was the real founder of the empire of the Moguls, the first\r\nsuccessful conqueror of Rajput independence: to this end his virtues\r\nwere powerful auxiliaries, as by his skill in the analysis of the mind\r\nand its readiest stimulant to action, he was enabled to gild the chains\r\nwith which he bound them. To these they became familiarized by habit,\r\nespecially when the throne exerted its power in acts gratifying to\r\nnational vanity, or even in ministering to the more ignoble passions.\r\nBut generations of the martial races were cut off by his sword, and\r\nlustres rolled away ere his conquests were sufficiently confirmed to\r\npermit him to exercise the beneficence of his nature, and obtain by the\r\nuniversal acclaim of the conquered, the proud epithet of Jagad Guru, or\r\n‘guardian of mankind.’ He was long ranked with Shihabu-d-din, Ala, and\r\nother instruments of destruction, and with every just claim; and, like\r\nthese, he constructed a Mimbar[4.10.23] for the Koran from the altars of\r\nEklinga. Yet he finally succeeded in healing the wounds his ambition had\r\ninflicted, and received from millions that meed of praise which no other\r\nof his race ever obtained.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the kingly virtues in the sovereign of Mewar filled to\r\nthe brim the bitter cup of her destiny. The guardian goddess of the\r\nSesodias had promised never to abandon the rock of her pride while a\r\ndescendant of Bappa Rawal devoted himself to her service. In the first\r\nassault by Ala, twelve crowned heads defended the ‘crimson banner’ to\r\nthe death. In the second, when conquest led by Bajazet[4.10.24] came\r\nfrom the south, the chieftain of Deolia, a noble scion of Mewar, “though\r\nsevered from her stem,” claimed the crown of glory and of martyrdom. But\r\non this, the third and grandest struggle, no regal victim appeared to\r\nappease the Cybele of Chitor, and win her to retain its\r\n‘kunguras’[4.10.25] as her coronet. She fell! the charm was broken; the\r\nmysterious tie was severed for ever which connected [325] Chitor with\r\nperpetuity of sway to the race of Guhilot. With Udai Singh fled the\r\n“fair face” which in the dead of night unsealed the eyes of Samarsi, and\r\ntold him “the glory of the Hindu was departing”:[4.10.26] with him, that\r\nopinion, which for ages esteemed her walls the sanctuary of the race,\r\nwhich encircled her with a halo of glory, as the palladium of the\r\nreligion and the liberties of the Rajputs.\r\n\r\nTo traditions such as these, history is indebted for the noblest deeds\r\nrecorded in her page; and in Mewar they were the covert impulse to\r\nnational glory and independence. For this the philosopher will value the\r\nrelation; and the philanthropist as being the germs or nucleus of\r\nresistance against tyrannical domination. Enveloped in a wild fable, we\r\nsee the springs of their prejudices and their action: batter down these\r\nadamantine walls of national opinion, and all others are but glass. The\r\nonce invincible Chitor is now pronounced indefensible. “The abode of\r\nregality, which for a thousand years reared her head above all the\r\ncities of Hindustan,” is become the refuge of wild beasts, which seek\r\ncover in her temples; and this erst sanctified capital is now desecrated\r\nas the dwelling of evil fortune, into which the entrance of her princes\r\nis solemnly interdicted.\r\n\r\n=Akbar besieges Chitor, September, A.D. 1567.=—Ferishta mentions but\r\none enterprise against Chitor, that of its capture; but the annals\r\nrecord another, when Akbar was compelled to relinquish the\r\nundertaking.[4.10.27] The successful defence is attributed to the\r\nmasculine courage of the Rana’s concubine queen, who headed the\r\nsallies into the heart of the Mogul camp, and on one occasion to the\r\nemperor’s headquarters. The imbecile Rana proclaimed that he owed his\r\ndeliverance to her; when the chiefs, indignant at this imputation on\r\ntheir courage, conspired and put her to death. Internal discord\r\ninvited Akbar to reinvest Chitor; he had just attained his\r\ntwenty-fifth year, and was desirous of the renown of capturing it. The\r\nsite of the royal Urdu,[4.10.28] or camp, is still pointed out. It\r\nextended from the village of Pandauli[4.10.29] along the high road to\r\nBasai, a distance of ten miles. The headquarters of Akbar are yet\r\nmarked by a pyramidal column of marble, to which tradition has\r\nassigned the [326] title of Akbar ka diwa, or ‘Akbar’s lamp.’[4.10.30]\r\nScarcely had Akbar sat down before Chitor, when the Rana was compelled\r\n(say the annals) to quit it; but the necessity and his wishes were in\r\nunison. It lacked not, however, brave defenders. Sahidas, at the head\r\nof a numerous band of the descendants of Chonda, was at his post, ‘the\r\ngate of the sun’; there he fell resisting the entrance of the foe, and\r\nthere his altar stands, on the brow of the rock which was moistened\r\nwith his blood. Rawat Duda of Madri led ‘the sons of Sanga.’[4.10.31]\r\nThe feudatory chiefs of Bedla and Kotharia, descended from Prithiraj\r\nof Delhi—the Pramar of Bijolia—the Jhala of Sadri—inspired their\r\ncontingents with their brave example: these were all home chieftains.\r\nAnother son of Deolia again combated for Chitor, with the Sonigira Rao\r\nof Jalor—Isaridas Rathor, Karamchand Kachhwaha,[4.10.32] with Duda\r\nSadani,[4.10.33] and the Tuar prince of Gwalior, were distinguished\r\namongst the foreign auxiliaries on this occasion.\r\n\r\n=Jaimall and Patta.=—But the names which shine brightest in this gloomy\r\npage of the annals of Mewar, which are still held sacred by the bard and\r\nthe true Rajput, and immortalized by Akbar’s own pen, are Jaimall of\r\nBadnor and Patta of Kelwa, both of the sixteen superior vassals of\r\nMewar. The first was a Rathor of the Mertia house, the bravest of the\r\nbrave clans of Marwar; the other was head of the Jagawats, another grand\r\nshoot from Chonda. The names of Jaimall and Patta are ‘as household\r\nwords,’ inseparable in Mewar, and will be honoured while the Rajput\r\nretains a shred of his inheritance or a spark of his ancient\r\nrecollections. Though deprived of the stimulus which would have been\r\ngiven had their prince been a witness of their deeds, heroic\r\nachievements such as those already recorded were conspicuous on this\r\noccasion; and many a fair form threw the buckler over the scarf, and led\r\nthe most desperate sorties [327].\r\n\r\nWhen Salumbar[4.10.34] fell at the gate of the sun, the command devolved\r\non Patta of Kelwa. He was only sixteen:[4.10.35] his father had fallen\r\nin the last shock, and his mother had survived but to rear this the sole\r\nheir of their house. Like the Spartan mother of old, she commanded him\r\nto put on the ‘saffron robe,’ and to die for Chitor: but surpassing the\r\nGrecian dame, she illustrated her precept by example; and lest any soft\r\n‘compunctious visitings’ for one dearer than herself might dim the\r\nlustre of Kelwa, she armed the young bride with a lance, with her\r\ndescended the rock, and the defenders of Chitor saw her fall, fighting\r\nby the side of her Amazonian mother. When their wives and daughters\r\nperformed such deeds, the Rajputs became reckless of life. They had\r\nmaintained a protracted defence, but had no thoughts of surrender, when\r\na ball struck Jaimall, who took the lead on the fall of the kin of\r\nMewar. His soul revolted at the idea of ingloriously perishing by a\r\ndistant blow. He saw there was no ultimate hope of salvation, the\r\nnorthern defences being entirely destroyed, and he resolved to signalize\r\nthe end of his career. The fatal Johar was commanded, while eight\r\nthousand Rajputs ate the last ‘bira’[4.10.36] together, and put on their\r\nsaffron robes; the gates were thrown open, the work of destruction\r\ncommenced, and few survived ‘to stain the yellow mantle’ by inglorious\r\nsurrender. Akbar entered Chitor, when thirty thousand of its inhabitants\r\nbecame victims to the ambitious thirst of conquest of this ‘guardian of\r\nmankind.’ All the heads of clans, both home and foreign, fell, and\r\nseventeen hundred of the immediate kin of the prince sealed their duty\r\nto their country with their lives. The Tuar chief of Gwalior appears to\r\nhave been the only one of note who was reserved for another day of\r\nglory.[4.10.37] Nine queens, five princesses (their daughters), with two\r\ninfant sons, and the families of all the chieftains not at their\r\nestates, perished in the flames or in the assault of this ever memorable\r\nday. Their divinity had indeed deserted them; for it was on Adityawar,\r\nthe day of the sun,[4.10.38] he shed for the last time a ray of glory on\r\nChitor. The rock of their strength was despoiled; the temples, the\r\npalaces dilapidated: and, to complete her humiliation and his triumph,\r\nAkbar bereft her of all the symbols of [328] regality: the\r\nnakkaras,[4.10.39] whose reverberations proclaimed, for miles around,\r\nthe entrance and exit of her princes; the candelabras from the shrine of\r\nthe ‘great mother,’ who girt Bappa Rawal with the sword with which he\r\nconquered Chitor; and, in mockery of her misery, her portals, to adorn\r\nhis projected capital, Akbarabad.[4.10.40]\r\n\r\nAkbar claimed the honour of the death of Jaimall by his own hand: the\r\nfact is recorded by Abu-l Fazl, and by the emperor Jahangir, who\r\nconferred on the matchlock which aided him to this distinction the title\r\nof Sangram.[4.10.41] But the conqueror of Chitor evinced a more exalted\r\nsense, not only of the value of his conquest, but of the merits of his\r\nfoes, in erecting statues to the names of Jaimall and Patta at the most\r\nconspicuous entrance of his palace at Delhi; and they retained that\r\ndistinction even when Bernier was in India.[4.10.42]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHITOR.\r\n  _To face page 382._\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The Sin of the Capture of Chitor.=—When the Carthaginian gained the\r\nbattle of Cannae, he measured his success by the bushels of rings taken\r\nfrom the fingers of the equestrian Romans who fell in that memorable\r\nfield. Akbar estimated his, by the quantity of cordons (_zunnar_) of\r\n[329] distinction taken from the necks of the Rajputs, and seventy-four\r\nmans and a half[4.10.43] are the recorded amount. To eternize the memory\r\nof this disaster, the numerals ‘74½’ are _talak_, or accursed.[4.10.44]\r\nMarked on the banker’s letter in Rajasthan it is the strongest of seals,\r\nfor ‘the sin of the slaughter of Chitor’[4.10.45] is thereby invoked on\r\nall who violate a letter under the safeguard of this mysterious number.\r\nHe would be a fastidious critic who stopped to calculate the weight of\r\nthese cordons of the Rajput cavaliers, probably as much over-rated as\r\nthe trophies of the Roman rings, which are stated at three and a half\r\nbushels. It is for the moral impression that history deigns to note such\r\nanecdotes, in themselves of trivial import. So long as ‘74½’ shall\r\nremain recorded, some good will result from the calamity, and may\r\nsurvive when the event which caused it is buried in oblivion.\r\n\r\n=Escape of Rāna Udai Singh: Foundation of Udaipur.=—When Udai Singh\r\nabandoned Chitor, he found refuge with the Gohil in the forests of\r\nRajpipli. Thence he passed to the valley of the Giro in the Aravalli, in\r\nthe vicinity of the retreat of his great ancestor Bappa, ere he\r\nconquered Chitor. At the entrance of this valley, several years previous\r\nto this catastrophe, he had formed the lake, still called after him Udai\r\nSagar, and he now raised a dyke between the mountains which dammed up\r\nanother mountain stream. On the cluster of hills adjoining he raised the\r\nsmall palace called Nauchauki, around which edifices soon arose, and\r\nformed a city to which he gave his own name, Udaipur,[4.10.46]\r\nhenceforth the capital of Mewar.\r\n\r\n=Death of Rāna Udai Singh.=—Four years had Udai Singh survived the loss\r\nof Chitor, when he expired at Gogunda, at the early age of forty-two;\r\nyet far too long for his country’s honour and welfare. He left a\r\nnumerous issue of twenty-five legitimate sons, whose descendants, all\r\nstyled Ranawat, pushed aside the more ancient stock, and form that\r\nextensive clan distinctively termed the Babas, or ‘infants,’ of Mewar,\r\nwhether Ranawats, Purawats, or Kanawats. His last act was to entail with\r\na barren sceptre contention upon his children; for, setting aside the\r\nestablished laws of primogeniture, he proclaimed his favourite son\r\nJagmall his successor.\r\n\r\n=Jagmall proclaimed Rāna.=—In Mewar there is no interregnum: even the\r\nceremony of _matam_ (mourning) is held at the [330] house of the family\r\npriest while the palace is decked out for rejoicing. On the full moon of\r\nthe spring month of Phalgun, while his brothers and the nobles attended\r\nthe funeral pyre, Jagmall took possession of the throne in the infant\r\ncapital, Udaipur: but even while the trumpets sounded, and the heralds\r\ncalled aloud “May the king live for ever!” a cabal was formed round the\r\nbier of his father.\r\n\r\n=Jagmall deposed in favour of Rāna Partāp Singh.=—It will be borne in\r\nmind that Udai Singh espoused the Sonigira princess; and the Jalor Rao,\r\ndesirous to see his sister’s son have his right, demanded of Kistna, the\r\n‘great ancient’ of Mewar and the leader of the Chondawats, how such\r\ninjustice was sanctioned by him. “When a sick man has reached the last\r\nextreme and asks for milk to drink, why refuse it?” was the reply; with\r\nthe addition: “The Sonigira’s nephew is my choice, and my stand by\r\nPartap.” Jagmall had just entered the Rasora, and Partap was saddling\r\nfor his departure, when Rawat Kistna entered, accompanied by the\r\nex-prince of Gwalior. Each chief took an arm of Jagmall, and with gentle\r\nviolence removed him to a seat in front of the ‘cushion’ he had\r\noccupied; the hereditary premier remarking, “You had made a mistake,\r\nMaharaj; that place belongs to your brother”: and girding Partap with\r\nthe sword (the privilege of this house), thrice touching the ground,\r\nhailed him king of Mewar. All followed the example of Salumbar. Scarcely\r\nwas the ceremony over, when the young prince remarked, it was the\r\nfestival of the Aheria, nor must ancient customs be forgotten:\r\n“Therefore to horse, and slay a boar to Gauri,[4.10.47] and take the\r\nomen for the ensuing year.” They slew abundance of game, and in the\r\nmimic field of war, the nobles who surrounded the gallant Partap\r\nanticipated happier days for Mewar [331].\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.10.1:\r\n\r\n  The seraglio, or female palace.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.10.2:\r\n\r\n  Bari, Nai, are names for the barbers, who are the _cuisiniers_ of the\r\n  Rajputs.

His horse, on the way,\r\n  falling down dead with fatigue, he desired Tirdi Beg, who was well\r\n  mounted, to let him have his; but so ungenerous was this man, and so\r\n  low was royalty fallen, that he refused to comply with his request.\r\n  The troops of the raja being close to his heels, he was necessitated\r\n  to mount a camel, till one Nidim Koka, dismounting his own mother,\r\n  gave the king her horse, and, placing her on the camel, ran himself on\r\n  foot by her side.\r\n\r\n  \"The country through which they fled being an entire sandy desert, the\r\n  troop began to be in the utmost distress for water. Some ran mad,\r\n  others fell down dead; nothing was heard but dreadful screams and\r\n  lamentations. To add, if possible, to this calamity, news arrived of\r\n  the enemy’s near approach. Humaioon ordered all those who could fight\r\n  to halt, and let the women and baggage move forward. The enemy not\r\n  making their appearance, the king rode on in front to see how it fared\r\n  with his family.\r\n\r\n  \"Night, in the meantime, coming on, the rear lost their way, and in\r\n  the morning were attacked by a party of the enemy. Shech Ali, with\r\n  about twenty brave men, resolved to sell his life dear. Having\r\n  repeated the creed of martyrdom, he rushed upon the enemy, and the\r\n  first arrow having reached the heart of the chief of the party, the\r\n  rest were by the valour of his handful put to flight. The other Moguls\r\n  joined in the pursuit, and took many of the camels and horses. They\r\n  then continued their march, found the king sitting by a well which he\r\n  had fortunately found, and gave him an account of their adventure.\r\n\r\n  \"Marching forward the next day from this well, they were more\r\n  distressed than before, there being no water for two days’ journey. On\r\n  the fourth day of their retreat they fell in with another well, which\r\n  was so deep, that the only bucket they had took a great deal of time\r\n  in being wound up, and therefore a drum was beat to give notice to the\r\n  caffilas when the bucket appeared, that they might repair by turns to\r\n  drink. The people were so impatient for the water, that as soon as the\r\n  first bucket appeared, ten or twelve of them threw themselves upon it\r\n  before it quite reached the brim of the well, by which means the rope\r\n  broke, and the bucket was lost, and several fell headlong after it.\r\n  When this fatal accident happened, the screams and lamentations of all\r\n  became loud and dreadful. Some lolling out their tongues, rolled\r\n  themselves in agony on the hot sand; while others, precipitating\r\n  themselves into the well, met with an immediate, and consequently an\r\n  easier death. What did not the unhappy king feel, when he saw this\r\n  terrible situation of his few faithful friends!\r\n\r\n  \"The next day, though they reached water, was not less fatal than the\r\n  former. The camels, who had not tasted water for several days, now\r\n  drank so much that the greatest part of them died. The people, also,\r\n  after drinking, complained of an oppression of the heart, and in about\r\n  half an hour a great part of them expired.\r\n\r\n  \"A few, with the king, after this unheard-of distress, reached\r\n  Amercote. The raja, being a humane man, took compassion on their\r\n  misfortunes: he spared nothing that could alleviate their miseries, or\r\n  express his fidelity to the king.\r\n\r\n  “At Amercote, upon Sunday the fifth of Rigib, in the year nine hundred\r\n  and forty-nine, the prince Akber was brought forth by Hamida Banu\r\n  Begum. The king, after returning thanks to God, left his family under\r\n  the protection of Raja Rana, and, by the aid of that prince, marched\r\n  against Bicker.” Dow’s _Ferishta_ [2nd ed. ii. 136 ff.

A huge concave vessel was then filled with\r\n  fire, which served as a night-beacon to this ambulatory city, where\r\n  all nations and tongues were assembled, or to guide the foragers.\r\n  Akbar, who was ambitious of being the founder of a new faith as well\r\n  as kingdom, had tried every creed, Jewish, Hindu, and even made some\r\n  progress in the doctrines of Christianity, and may have in turn\r\n  affected those of Zardusht, and assuredly this pyramid possesses more\r\n  of the appearance of a pyreum than a ‘diwa’; though either would have\r\n  fulfilled the purport of a beacon. [Mr. V. A. Smith, quoting Kavi Rāj\r\n  Shyāmal Dās, ‘Antiquities at Nagari’ (_JASB_, Part i. vol. lvi.\r\n  (1887), p. 75), corrects the statements in this note.

Ala’s assault was\r\n  comparatively harmless, as the care of the fortress was assigned to a\r\n  Hindu prince; and Bayazid had little time to fulfil this part of the\r\n  Mosaic law, maintained with rigid severity by the followers of\r\n  Islamism. Besides, at those periods, they possessed both the skill and\r\n  the means to reconstruct: not so after Akbar, as the subsequent\r\n  portion of the annals will show but a struggle for existence. The arts\r\n  do not flourish amidst penury: the principle to construct cannot long\r\n  survive, when the means to execute are fled; and in the monumental\r\n  works of Chitor we can trace the gradations of genius, its splendour\r\n  and decay.

Elevated with this design, he hurried into conflict with\r\nhis powerful antagonist, nor stooped to calculate the means which were\r\nopposed to him. Accustomed to read in his country’s annals the splendid\r\ndeeds of his forefathers, and that Chitor had more than once been the\r\nprison of their foes, he trusted that the revolutions of fortune might\r\nco-operate with his own efforts to overturn the unstable throne of\r\nDelhi. The reasoning was as just as it was noble; but whilst he gave\r\nloose to those lofty aspirations which meditated liberty to Mewar, his\r\ncrafty opponent was counteracting his views by a scheme of policy which,\r\nwhen disclosed, filled his heart with anguish. The wily Mogul arrayed\r\nagainst Partap his kindred in faith as well as blood. The princes of\r\nMarwar, Amber, Bikaner, and even Bundi, late his firm ally, took part\r\nwith Akbar and upheld despotism. Nay, even his own brother,\r\nSagarji,[4.11.2] deserted him, and received, as the price of his\r\ntreachery, the ancient capital of his race, and the title which that\r\npossession conferred [332].\r\n\r\n=Rāna Partāp Singh resists the Moguls.=—But the magnitude of the peril\r\nconfirmed the fortitude of Partap, who vowed, in the words of the bard,\r\n“to make his mother’s milk resplendent”; and he amply redeemed his\r\npledge. Single-handed, for a quarter of a century did he withstand the\r\ncombined efforts of the empire; at one time carrying destruction into\r\nthe plains, at another flying from rock to rock, feeding his family from\r\nthe fruits of his native hills, and rearing the nursling hero Amra,\r\namidst savage beasts and scarce less savage men, a fit heir to his\r\nprowess and revenge. The bare idea that “the son of Bappa Rawal should\r\nbow the head to mortal man,” was insupportable; and he spurned every\r\noverture which had submission for its basis, or the degradation of\r\nuniting his family by marriage with the Tatar, though lord of countless\r\nmultitudes.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant acts he achieved during that period live in every valley;\r\nthey are enshrined in the heart of every true Rajput, and many are\r\nrecorded in the annals of the conquerors. To recount them all, or relate\r\nthe hardships he sustained, would be to pen what they would pronounce a\r\nromance who had not traversed the country where tradition is yet\r\neloquent with his exploits, or conversed with the descendants of his\r\nchiefs, who cherish a recollection of the deeds of their forefathers,\r\nand melt, as they recite them, into manly tears.[4.11.3]\r\n\r\nPartap was nobly supported; and though wealth and fortune tempted the\r\nfidelity of his chiefs, not one was found base enough to abandon him.\r\nThe sons of Jaimall shed their blood in his cause, along with the\r\nsuccessors of Patta—the house of Salumbar redoubled the claims of Chonda\r\nto fidelity; and these five lustres of adversity are the brightest in\r\nthe chequered page of the history of Mewar. Nay, some chiefs, attracted\r\nby the very desperation of his fortunes, pressed to his standard, to\r\ncombat and die with Partap. Amongst these was the Delwara chief, whose\r\ndevotion gained him the prince’s ‘right hand.’\r\n\r\n=The Vow of Rāna Partāp Singh.=—To commemorate the desolation of Chitor,\r\nwhich the bardic historian represents as a ‘widow’ despoiled of the\r\nornaments to her loveliness, Partap interdicted to himself and his\r\nsuccessors every article of luxury or pomp, until the insignia of her\r\nglory should be redeemed. The gold and silver dishes were laid aside\r\n[333] for _pattras_[4.11.4] of leaves; their beds henceforth of straw,\r\nand their beards left untouched. But in order more distinctly to mark\r\ntheir fallen fortune and stimulate to its recovery, he commanded that\r\nthe martial _nakkaras_, which always sounded in the van of battle or\r\nprocessions, should follow in the rear. This last sign of the depression\r\nof Mewar still survives; the beard is yet untouched by the shears; and\r\neven in the subterfuge by which the patriot king’s behest is set aside,\r\nwe have a tribute to his memory: for though his descendant eats off gold\r\nand silver, and sleeps upon a bed, he places the leaves beneath the one\r\nand straw under the other.[4.11.5]\r\n\r\nOften was Partap heard to exclaim, “Had Udai Singh never been, or none\r\nintervened between him and Sanga Rana, no Turk should ever have given\r\nlaws to Rajasthan.” Hindu society had assumed a new form within the\r\ncentury preceding: the wrecks of dominion from the Jumna and Ganges had\r\nbeen silently growing into importance; and Amber and Marwar had attained\r\nsuch power, that the latter single-handed coped with the imperial Sher\r\nShah; while numerous minor chieftainships were attaining shape and\r\nstrength on both sides the Chambal. A prince of commanding genius alone\r\nwas wanting, to snatch the sceptre of dominion from the Islamite. Such a\r\nleader they found in Sanga, who possessed every quality which extorts\r\nspontaneous obedience, and the superiority of whose birth, as well as\r\ndignity, were admitted without cavil, from the Himalaya to\r\nRameswaram.[4.11.6] These States had powerful motives to obey such a\r\nleader, in the absence of whom their ancient patrimony was lost; and\r\nsuch they would have found renewed in Sanga’s grandson, Partap, had Udai\r\nSingh not existed, or had a less gifted sovereign than Akbar been his\r\ncontemporary.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of some chiefs of judgment and experience, Partap\r\nremodelled his government, adapting it to the exigencies of the times\r\nand to his slender resources. New grants were issued, with regulations\r\ndefining the service required. Kumbhalmer, now the seat of government,\r\nwas strengthened, as well as Gogunda and other mountain fortresses; and,\r\nbeing unable to keep the field in the plains [334] of Mewar, he followed\r\nthe system of his ancestors, and commanded his subjects, on pain of\r\ndeath, to retire into the mountains. During the protracted contest, the\r\nfertile tracts watered by the Banas and the Berach, from the Aravalli\r\nchain west to the eastern tableland, were _be chiragh_, ‘without a\r\nlamp.’\r\n\r\nMany tales are related of the unrelenting severity with which Partap\r\nenforced obedience to this stern policy. Frequently, with a few horse,\r\nhe issued forth to see that his commands were obeyed. The silence of the\r\ndesert prevailed in the plains; grass had usurped the place of the\r\nwaving corn; the highways were choked with the thorny babul,[4.11.7] and\r\nbeasts of prey made their abode in the habitations of his subjects. In\r\nthe midst of this desolation, a single goatherd, trusting to elude\r\nobservation, disobeyed his prince’s injunction, and pastured his flock\r\nin the luxuriant meadows of Untala, on the banks of the Banas. After a\r\nfew questions, he was killed and hung up _in terrorem_. By such\r\npatriotic severity Partap rendered ‘the garden of Rajasthan’ of no value\r\nto the conqueror, and the commerce already established between the Mogul\r\ncourt and Europe, conveyed through Mewar from Surat and other ports, was\r\nintercepted and plundered.\r\n\r\n=Akbar attacks Rāna Partāp Singh, A.D. 1576.=—Akbar took the field\r\nagainst the Rajput prince, establishing his headquarters at Ajmer. This\r\ncelebrated fortress, destined ultimately to be one of the twenty-two\r\nsubahs of his empire and an imperial residence, had admitted for some\r\ntime a royal garrison. Maldeo of Marwar, who had so ably opposed the\r\nusurper Sher Shah, was compelled to follow the example of his brother\r\nprince, Bhagwandas of Amber, and to place himself at the footstool of\r\nAkbar: only two years subsequent to Partap’s accession, after a brave\r\nbut fruitless resistance in Merta and Jodhpur, he sent his son, Udai\r\nSingh, to pay homage to the king.[4.11.8] Akbar received him at Nagor,\r\non his route to Ajmer, on which occasion the Raos of Mandor were made\r\nRajas; and as the heir of Marwar was of uncommon bulk, the title by\r\nwhich he was afterwards known in Rajasthan was Mota Raja,[4.11.9] and\r\nhenceforth the descendants of the kings of Kanauj had the ‘right hand’\r\nof the emperor of the Moguls. But the Rathor was greater in his native\r\npride than with all the accession of dignity or power which accrued on\r\nhis sacrifice of Rajput principles [335]. Udai ‘le gros’ was the first\r\nof his race who gave a daughter in marriage to a Tatar. The bribe for\r\nwhich he bartered his honour was splendid; for four provinces,[4.11.10]\r\nyielding £200,000 of annual revenue, were given in exchange for Jodh\r\nBai,[4.11.11] at once doubling the fisc of Marwar. With such examples as\r\nAmber and Marwar, and with less power to resist the temptation, the\r\nminor chiefs of Rajasthan, with a brave and numerous vassalage, were\r\ntransformed into satraps of Delhi, and the importance of most of them\r\nwas increased by the change. Truly did the Mogul historian designate\r\nthem “at once the props and the ornaments of the throne.”\r\n\r\n=Rāna Partāp Singh deserted by Rājput Princes.=—But these were fearful\r\nodds against Partap: the arms of his countrymen thus turned upon him,\r\nderived additional weight from their self-degradation, which kindled\r\ninto jealousy and hatred against the magnanimous resolution they wanted\r\nthe virtue to imitate. When Hindu prejudice was thus violated by every\r\nprince in Rajasthan (that of Bundi alone excepted[4.11.12]), the Rana\r\nrenounced all alliance with those who were thus degraded; and in order\r\nto carry on the line, he sought out and incorporated with the first\r\nclass of nobles of his own kin the descendants of the ancient princes of\r\nDelhi, of Patan, of Marwar, and of Dhar. To the eternal honour of Partap\r\nand his issue be it told, that to the very close of the monarchy of the\r\nMoguls, they not only refused such alliance with the throne, but even\r\nwith their brother princes of Marwar and Amber. It is a proud triumph of\r\nvirtue to record, from the autograph letters of the most powerful of\r\ntheir princes, Bakhta Singh and Jai Singh, that whilst they had risen to\r\ngreatness from the surrender of principle, as Mewar had decayed from her\r\nadherence to it, they should, even while basking in court favour,\r\nsolicit, and that humbly, to be readmitted to the honour of matrimonial\r\nintercourse—‘to be purified,’ ‘to be regenerated,’ ‘to be made Rajputs’:\r\nand that this was granted only on condition of their abjuring the\r\ncontaminating practice which had disunited them for more than a century;\r\nwith the additional stipulation, that the issue of marriage with the\r\nhouse [336] of Mewar should be the heirs to those they entered:\r\nconditions which the decline of the empire prevented from being broken.\r\n\r\n=Rāja Mān Singh and Rāna Partāp Singh.=—An anecdote illustrative of the\r\nsettled repugnance of this noble family to sully the purity of its blood\r\nmay here be related, as its result had a material influence on its\r\nsubsequent condition. Raja Man, who had succeeded to the throne of\r\nAmber, was the most celebrated of his race, and from him may be dated\r\nthe rise of his country. This prince exemplified the wisdom of that\r\npolicy which Babur adopted to strengthen his conquest; that of\r\nconnecting his family by ties of marriage with the Hindus. It has been\r\nalready related, that Humayun espoused a daughter of Bhagwandas,\r\nconsequently Raja Man was brother-in-law to Akbar.[4.11.13] His courage\r\nand talents well seconded this natural advantage, and he became the most\r\nconspicuous of all the generals of the empire. To him Akbar was indebted\r\nfor half his triumphs. The Kachhwaha bards find a delightful theme in\r\nrecounting his exploits, from the snow-clad Caucasus to the shores of\r\nthe ‘golden Chersonese.’[4.11.14] Let the eye embrace these extremes of\r\nhis conquests, Kabul and the Paropanisos of Alexander, and Arakan (a\r\nname now well known) on the Indian Ocean; the former reunited, the\r\nlatter subjugated, to the empire by a Rajput prince and a Rajput army.\r\nBut Akbar knew the master-key to Hindu feeling, and by his skill\r\novercame prejudices deemed insurmountable, and many are the tales yet\r\ntold of their blind devotion to their favourite emperor.\r\n\r\nRaja Man was returning from the conquest of Sholapur to Hindustan when\r\nhe invited himself to an interview with Partap, then at Kumbhalmer, who\r\nadvanced to the Udaisagar to receive him. On the mound which embanks\r\nthis lake a feast was prepared for the prince of Amber. The board was\r\nspread, the Raja summoned, and Prince Amra appointed to wait upon him;\r\nbut no Rana appeared, for whose absence apologies alleging headache were\r\nurged by his son, with the request [337] that Raja Man would waive all\r\nceremony, receive his welcome, and commence. The prince, in a tone at\r\nonce dignified and respectful, replied: \"Tell the Rana I can divine the\r\ncause of his headache; but the error is irremediable, and if he refuses\r\nto put a plate (_kansa_) before me, who will?\" Further subterfuge was\r\nuseless. The Rana expressed his regret; but added, that “he could not\r\neat with a Rajput who gave his sister to a Turk, and who probably ate\r\nwith him.” Raja Man was unwise to have risked this disgrace: and if the\r\ninvitation went from Partap, the insult was ungenerous as well as\r\nimpolitic; but of this he is acquitted. Raja Man left the feast\r\nuntouched, _save the few grains of rice he offered to Anndeva,_[4.11.15]\r\n_which he placed in his turban_, observing as he withdrew: “It was for\r\nthe preservation of your honour that we sacrificed our own, and gave our\r\nsisters and our daughters to the Turk; but abide in peril, if such be\r\nyour resolve, for this country shall not hold you”; and mounting his\r\nhorse he turned to the Rana, who appeared at this abrupt termination of\r\nhis visit, “If I do not humble your pride, my name is not Man”: to which\r\nPartap replied, “he should always be happy to meet him”; while some one,\r\nin less dignified terms, desired he would not forget to bring his\r\n‘_Phupha_’ [father’s sister’s husband], Akbar. The ground was deemed\r\nimpure where the feast was spread: it was broken up and lustrated with\r\nthe water of the Ganges, and the chiefs who witnessed the humiliation of\r\none they deemed apostate, bathed and changed their vestments, as if\r\npolluted by his presence. Every act was reported to the emperor, who was\r\nexasperated at the insult thus offered to himself, and who justly\r\ndreaded the revival of those prejudices he had hoped were vanquished;\r\nand it hastened the first of those sanguinary battles which have\r\nimmortalised the name of Partap: nor will Haldighat be forgotten while a\r\nSesodia occupies Mewar, or a bard survives to relate the tale.\r\n\r\n=Salīm’s Campaign, A.D. 1576.=—Prince Salim, the heir of Delhi,[4.11.16]\r\nled the war, guided by the counsels of Raja Man and the distinguished\r\napostate son of Sagarji, Mahabat Khan. Partap trusted to his native\r\nhills and the valour of twenty-two thousand Rajputs to withstand the son\r\nof Akbar. The divisions of the royal army encountered little opposition\r\nat the exterior defiles by which they penetrated the western side of the\r\n[338] Aravalli, concentrating as they approached the chief pass which\r\nconducted to the vulnerable part of this intricate country.\r\n\r\n=Battle of Haldīghāt or Gogūnda, June 18, 1576.=—The range to which\r\nPartap was restricted was the mountainous region around, though chiefly\r\nto the west of the new capital. From north to south, Kumbhalmer to\r\nRakhabhnath,[4.11.17] about eighty miles in length; and in breadth, from\r\nMirpur west to Satola east, about the same. The whole of this space is\r\nmountain and forest, valley and stream. The approaches to the capital\r\nfrom every point to the north, west, and south are so narrow as to merit\r\nthe term of defile; on each side lofty perpendicular rocks, with\r\nscarcely breadth for two carriages abreast, across which are those\r\nramparts of nature termed _Col_ in the mountain scenery of Europe, which\r\noccasionally open into spaces sufficiently capacious to encamp a large\r\nforce. Such was the plain of Haldighat, at the base of a neck of\r\nmountain which shut up the valley and rendered it almost\r\ninaccessible.[4.11.18] Above and below the Rajputs were posted, and on\r\nthe cliffs and pinnacles overlooking the field of battle, the faithful\r\naborigines, the Bhil, with his natural weapon the bow and arrow, and\r\nhuge stones ready to roll upon the combatant enemy.\r\n\r\nAt this pass Partap was posted with the flower of Mewar, and glorious\r\nwas the struggle for its maintenance. Clan after clan followed with\r\ndesperate intrepidity, emulating the daring of their prince, who led the\r\ncrimson banner into the hottest part of the field. In vain he strained\r\nevery nerve to encounter Raja Man; but though denied the luxury of\r\nrevenge on his Rajput foe, he made good a passage to where Salim\r\ncommanded. His guards fell before Partap, and but for the steel plates\r\nwhich defended his howda, the lance of the Rajput would have deprived\r\nAkbar of his heir. His steed, the gallant Chetak, nobly seconded his\r\nlord, and is represented in all the historical drawings of this battle\r\nwith one foot raised upon the elephant of the Mogul, while his rider has\r\nhis lance propelled against his foe. The conductor, destitute of the\r\nmeans of defence, was slain, when the infuriated animal, now without\r\ncontrol, carried off Salim. On this spot the carnage was immense: the\r\nMoguls eager to defend Salim; the heroes of Mewar to second their\r\nprince, who had already received seven wounds [339].[4.11.19] Marked by\r\nthe ‘royal umbrella,’ which he would not lay aside, and which collected\r\nthe might of the enemy against him, Partap was thrice rescued from\r\namidst the foe, and was at length nearly overwhelmed, when the Jhala\r\nchief gave a signal instance of fidelity, and extricated him with the\r\nloss of his own life. Mana seized upon the insignia of Mewar, and\r\nrearing the ‘gold sun’ over his own head, made good his way to an\r\nintricate position, drawing after him the brunt of the battle, while his\r\nprince was forced from the field. With all his brave vassals the noble\r\nJhala fell; and in remembrance of the deed his descendants have, since\r\nthe day of Haldighat, borne the regal ensigns of Mewar, and enjoyed ‘the\r\nright hand of her princes.’[4.11.20] But this desperate valour was\r\nunavailing against such a force, with a numerous field artillery and a\r\ndromedary corps mounting swivels; and of twenty-two thousand Rajputs\r\nassembled on that day for the defence of Haldighat, only eight thousand\r\nquitted the field alive.[4.11.21]\r\n\r\n=The Escape of Rāna Partāp Singh.=—Partap, unattended, fled on the\r\ngallant Chetak, who had borne him through the day, and who saved him now\r\nby leaping a mountain stream when closely pursued by two Mogul chiefs,\r\nwhom this impediment momentarily checked. But Chetak, like his master,\r\nwas wounded; his pursuers gained upon Partap, and the flash from the\r\nflinty rock announced them at his heels, when, in the broad accents of\r\nhis native tongue, the salutation _Ho! nila ghora ra aswar_, ‘Ho! rider\r\nof the blue horse,’ made him look back, and he beheld but a single\r\nhorseman: that horseman his brother.\r\n\r\nSakta, whose personal enmity to Partap had made him a traitor to Mewar,\r\nbeheld from the ranks of Akbar the ‘blue horse’ flying unattended.\r\nResentment was extinguished, and a feeling of affection, mingling with\r\nsad and humiliating recollections, took possession of his bosom. He\r\njoined in the pursuit, but only to slay the pursuers, who fell beneath\r\nhis lance; and now, for the first time in their lives, the brothers\r\nembraced in friendship. Here Chetak fell, and as the Rana unbuckled his\r\ncaparison to place it upon Ankara, presented to him by his brother, the\r\nnoble steed expired. An altar was raised, and yet marks the spot, where\r\nChetak[4.11.22] died; and the entire scene may be seen painted on the\r\nwalls of half the houses of the capital [340].\r\n\r\nThe greeting between the brothers was necessarily short; but the merry\r\nSakta, who was attached to Salim’s personal force, could not let it pass\r\nwithout a joke; and inquiring “how a man felt when flying for his life?”\r\nhe quitted Partap with the assurance of reunion the first safe\r\nopportunity. On rejoining Salim, the truth of Sakta was greatly doubted\r\nwhen he related that Partap had not only slain his pursuers, but his own\r\nsteed, which obliged him to return on that of the Khorasani. Prince\r\nSalim pledged his word to pardon him if he related the truth; when Sakta\r\nreplied, “The burthen of a kingdom is on my brother’s shoulders, nor\r\ncould I witness his danger without defending him from it.” Salim kept\r\nhis word, but dismissed the future head of the Saktawats. Determined to\r\nmake a suitable nazar on his introduction, he redeemed Bhainsror by a\r\n_coup de main_, and joined Partap at Udaipur, who made him a grant of\r\nthe conquest, which long remained the chief abode of the\r\nSaktawats;[4.11.23] and since the day when this, their founder,\r\npreserved the life of his brother and prince against his Mogul pursuers,\r\nthe birad of the bard to all of his race is _Khorasani Multani ka Agal_,\r\n‘the barrier to Khorasan and Multan,’ from which countries were the\r\nchiefs he slew.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of Sawan, S. 1632 (July, A.D. 1576), a day ever memorable in\r\nher annals, the best blood of Mewar irrigated the pass of Haldighat. Of\r\nthe nearest kin of the prince five hundred were slain: the exiled prince\r\nof Gwalior, Ramsah, his son Khanderao, with three hundred and fifty of\r\nhis brave Tuar clan, paid the debt of gratitude with their lives. Since\r\ntheir expulsion by Babur they had found sanctuary in Mewar, whose\r\nprinces diminished their feeble revenues to maintain inviolable the\r\nrites of hospitality.[4.11.24] Mana, the devoted Jhala, lost one hundred\r\nand fifty of his vassals, and every house of Mewar mourned its chief\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n=Siege of Kumbhalmer.=—Elate with victory, Salim left the hills. The\r\nrainy season had set in, which impeded operations, and obtained for\r\nPartap a few months of repose; but with the spring the foe returned,\r\nwhen he was again defeated,[4.11.25] and took post in Kumbhalmer, which\r\nwas invested by the Koka, Shahbaz Khan. He here made a gallant and [341]\r\nprotracted resistance, and did not retire till insects rendered the\r\nwater of the Naugun well, their sole resource, impure.[4.11.26] To the\r\ntreachery of the Deora chief of Abu, who was now with Akbar, this deed\r\nis imputed. Partap thence withdrew to Chawand,[4.11.27] while Bhan, the\r\nSonigira chief, defended the place to the last, and was slain in the\r\nassault. On this occasion also fell the chief bard of Mewar, who\r\ninspired by his deeds, as well as by his song, the spirit of resistance\r\nto the ‘ruthless king,’ and whose laudatory couplets on the deeds of his\r\nlord are still in every mouth. But the spirit of poesy died not with\r\nhim, for princes and nobles, Hindu and Turk, vied with each other in\r\nexalting the patriot Partap, in strains replete with those sentiments\r\nwhich elevate the mind of the martial Rajput, who is inflamed into\r\naction by this national excitement.\r\n\r\n=Further Imperialist Advance.=—On the fall of Kumbhalmer, the castles of\r\nDharmeti and Gogunda were invested by Raja Man. Mahabat Khan took\r\npossession of Udaipur; and while a prince of the blood[4.11.28] cut off\r\nthe resources furnished by the inhabitants of Oghna Panarwra, Khan Farid\r\ninvaded Chappan, and approached Chawand from the south. Thus beset on\r\nevery side, dislodged from the most secret retreats, and hunted from\r\nglen to glen, there appeared no hope for Partap: yet, even while his\r\npursuers deemed him panting in some obscure lurking-place, he would by\r\nmountain signals reassemble his bands, and assail them unawares and\r\noften unguarded. By a skilful manœuvre, Farid, who dreamed of nothing\r\nless than making the Rajput prince his prisoner, was blocked up in a\r\ndefile and his force cut off to a man. Unaccustomed to such warfare, the\r\nmercenary Moguls became disgusted in combating a foe seldom tangible;\r\nwhile the monsoon swelled the mountain streams, filling the reservoirs\r\nwith mineral poisons and the air with pestilential exhalations. The\r\nperiodical rains accordingly always brought some respite to Partap.\r\n\r\nYears thus rolled away, each ending with a diminution of his means and\r\nan increase to his misfortunes. His family was his chief source of\r\nanxiety: he dreaded their captivity, an apprehension often on the point\r\nof being realised. On one occasion they were saved by the faithful Bhils\r\nof Kava, who carried them in wicker baskets and concealed them in the\r\ntin mines of Jawara, where they guarded [342] and fed them. Bolts and\r\nrings are still preserved in the trees about Jawara and Chawand, to\r\nwhich baskets were suspended, the only cradles of the royal children of\r\nMewar, in order to preserve them from the tiger and the wolf. Yet amidst\r\nsuch complicated evils the fortitude of Partap remained unshaken, and a\r\nspy sent by Akbar represented the Rajput and his chiefs seated at a\r\nscanty meal, maintaining all the etiquette observed in prosperity, the\r\nRana bestowing the _dauna_ to the most deserving, and which, though only\r\nof the wild fruit of the country, was received with all the reverence of\r\nbetter days. Such inflexible magnanimity touched the soul of\r\nAkbar,[4.11.29] and extorted the homage of every chief in Rajasthan; nor\r\ncould those who swelled the gorgeous train of the emperor withhold their\r\nadmiration. Nay, these annals have preserved some stanzas addressed by\r\nthe Khankhanan,[4.11.30] the first of the satraps of Delhi, to the noble\r\nRajput, in his native tongue, applauding his valour and stimulating his\r\nperseverance: “All is unstable in this world: land and wealth will\r\ndisappear, but the virtue of a great name lives for ever. Patta[4.11.31]\r\nabandoned wealth and land, but never bowed the head: alone, of all the\r\nprinces of Hind, he preserved the honour of his race.”\r\n\r\nBut there were moments when the wants of those dearer than his own life\r\nalmost excited him to frenzy. The wife of his bosom was insecure, even\r\nin the rock or the cave; and his infants, heirs to every luxury, were\r\nweeping around him for food: for with such pertinacity did the Mogul\r\nmyrmidons pursue them, that “five meals have been prepared and abandoned\r\nfor want of opportunity to eat them.” On one occasion his queen and his\r\nson’s wife were preparing a few cakes from the flour of the meadow\r\ngrass,[4.11.32] of which one was given to each; half for the present,\r\nthe rest for a future meal. Partap was stretched beside them pondering\r\non his misfortunes, when a piercing cry from his daughter roused him\r\nfrom reflection: a wild cat had darted on the reserved portion of food,\r\nand the agony of hunger made her shrieks insupportable. Until that\r\nmoment his fortitude had been unsubdued. He had beheld his sons and his\r\nkindred fall around him on the field without emotion—“For this the\r\nRajput was born”; but the lamentation of his children for food “unmanned\r\nhim.” He cursed the name of royalty, if only to be enjoyed on such\r\nconditions, and he demanded of Akbar a mitigation of his hardships\r\n[343].\r\n\r\n=Submission of Rāna Partāp Singh.=—Overjoyed at this indication of\r\nsubmission, the emperor commanded public rejoicings, and exultingly\r\nshowed the letter to Prithiraj, a Rajput compelled to follow the\r\nvictorious car of Akbar. Prithiraj was the younger brother of the prince\r\nof Bikaner,[4.11.33] a State recently grown out of the Rathors of\r\nMarwar, and which, being exposed in the flats of the desert, had no\r\npower to resist the example of its elder, Maldeo. Prithiraj was one of\r\nthe most gallant chieftains of the age, and like the Troubadour princes\r\nof the west, could grace a cause with the soul-inspiring effusions of\r\nthe muse, as well as aid it with his sword: nay, in an assembly of the\r\nbards of Rajasthan, the palm of merit was unanimously awarded to the\r\nRathor cavalier. He adored the very name of Partap, and the intelligence\r\nfilled him with grief. With all the warmth and frankness of his nature,\r\nhe told the king it was a forgery of some foe to the fame of the Rajput\r\nprince. “I know him well,” said he; “for your crown he would not submit\r\nto your terms.” He requested and obtained permission from the king to\r\ntransmit by his courier a letter to Partap, ostensibly to ascertain the\r\nfact of his submission, but really with the view to prevent it. On this\r\noccasion he composed those couplets, still admired, and which for the\r\neffect they produced will stand comparison with any of the _sirventes_\r\nof the Troubadours of the west.[4.11.34]\r\n\r\n\"The hopes of the Hindu rest on the Hindu; yet the Rana forsakes them.\r\nBut for Partap, all would be placed on the same level by Akbar; for our\r\nchiefs have lost their valour and our females their honour. Akbar is the\r\nbroker in the market of our race: all has he purchased but the son of\r\nUda; he is beyond his price. What true Rajput would part with honour for\r\nnine days (_nauroza_); yet how many have bartered it away? Will Chitor\r\ncome to this market, when all have disposed of the chief article of the\r\nKhatri? Though Patta has squandered away wealth, yet this treasure has\r\nhe preserved. Despair has driven man to this mart, to witness their\r\ndishonour: from such infamy the descendant of Hamir alone has been\r\npreserved. The world asks, whence the concealed aid of Partap? None but\r\nthe soul of manliness and his sword: with it, well has he maintained the\r\nKhatri’s pride. This broker in the market [344] of men will one day be\r\noverreached; he cannot live for ever: then will our race come to Partap,\r\nfor the seed of the Rajput to sow in our desolate lands. To him all look\r\nfor its preservation, that its purity may again become resplendent.\"\r\n\r\n=Rally of Rāna Partāp Singh.=—This effusion of the Rathor was equal to\r\nten thousand men; it nerved the drooping mind of Partap, and roused him\r\ninto action: for it was a noble incentive to find every eye of his race\r\nfixed upon him.\r\n\r\n=The Nauroza.=—The allusion of the princely poet in the phrase,\r\n“bartering their honour on the Nauroza,” requires some explanation. The\r\nNauroza, or ‘New Year’s Day,’ when the sun enters Aries, is one of great\r\nfestivity among the Muhammadan princes of the East; but of that alluded\r\nto by Prithiraj we can form an adequate idea from the historian Abu-l\r\nFazl.[4.11.35]\r\n\r\nIt is not New Year’s Day, but a festival especially instituted by Akbar,\r\nand to which he gave the epithet Khushroz, ‘day of pleasure,’ held on\r\nthe ninth day (_nauroza_), following the chief festival of each month.\r\nThe court assembled, and was attended by all ranks. The queen also had\r\nher court, when the wives of the nobles and of the Rajput vassal princes\r\nwere congregated. But the Khushroz was chiefly marked by a fair held\r\nwithin the precincts of the court, attended only by females. The\r\nmerchants’ wives exposed the manufactures of every clime, and the ladies\r\nof the court were the purchasers.[4.11.36] “His majesty is also there in\r\ndisguise, by which means he learns the value of merchandise, and hears\r\nwhat is said of the state of the empire and the character of the\r\nofficers of government.” The ingenuous Abu-l Fazl thus softens down the\r\nunhallowed purpose of this day; but posterity cannot admit that the\r\ngreat Akbar was to obtain these results amidst the Pushto jargon of the\r\ndames of Islam, or the mixed Bhakha of the fair of [345] Rajasthan.\r\nThese ‘ninth day fairs’ are the markets in which Rajput honour was\r\nbartered, and to which the brave Prithiraj makes allusion.[4.11.37]\r\n\r\n=Akbar and Rajput Ladies.=—It is scarcely to be credited that a\r\nstatesman like Akbar should have hazarded his popularity or his power,\r\nby the introduction of a custom alike appertaining to the Celtic races\r\nof Europe as to these the Goths of Asia;[4.11.38] and that he should\r\nseek to degrade those whom the chances of war had made his vassals, by\r\nconduct so nefarious and repugnant to the keenly cherished feelings of\r\nthe Rajput. Yet there is not a shadow of doubt that many of the noblest\r\nof the race were dishonoured on the Nauroza; and the chivalrous\r\nPrithiraj was only preserved from being of the number by the high\r\ncourage and virtue of his wife, a princess of Mewar, and daughter of the\r\nfounder of the Saktawats. On one of these celebrations of the Khushroz,\r\nthe monarch of the Moguls was struck with the beauty of the daughter of\r\nMewar, and he singled her out from amidst the united fair of Hind as the\r\nobject of his passion. It is not improbable that an ungenerous feeling\r\nunited with that already impure, to despoil the Sesodias of their\r\nhonour, through a princess of their house under the protection of the\r\nsovereign. On retiring from the fair, she found herself entangled amidst\r\nthe labyrinth of apartments by which egress was purposely ordained, when\r\nAkbar stood before her: but instead of acquiescence, she drew a poniard\r\nfrom her corset, and held it to his breast, dictating, and making him\r\nrepeat, the oath of renunciation of the infamy to all her race. The\r\nanecdote is accompanied in the original with many dramatic\r\ncircumstances. The guardian goddess of Mewar, the terrific Mata, appears\r\non her tiger in the subterranean passage of this palace of pollution, to\r\nstrengthen her mind by a solemn denunciation [346], and her hand with a\r\nweapon to protect her honour. Rae Singh, the elder brother of the\r\nprincely bard, had not been so fortunate; his wife wanted either courage\r\nor virtue to withstand the regal tempter, and she returned to their\r\ndwelling in the desert despoiled of her chastity, but loaded with\r\njewels; or, as Prithiraj expresses it: “She returned to her abode,\r\ntramping to the tinkling sound of the ornaments of gold and gems on her\r\nperson; but where, my brother, is the moustache[4.11.39] on thy lip?”\r\n\r\n=Adventures of Rāna Partāp Singh.=—It is time to return to the Aravalli,\r\nand to the patriot prince Partap. Unable to stem the torrent, he had\r\nformed a resolution worthy of his character; he determined to abandon\r\nMewar and the blood-stained Chitor (no longer the stay of his race), and\r\nto lead his Sesodias to the Indus, plant the ‘crimson banner’ on the\r\ninsular capital of the Sogdoi, and leave a desert between him and his\r\ninexorable foe. With his family, and all that was yet noble in Mewar,\r\nhis chiefs and vassals, a firm and intrepid band, who preferred exile to\r\ndegradation, he descended the Aravalli, and had reached the confines of\r\nthe desert, when an incident occurred which made him change his\r\nmeasures, and still remain a dweller in the land of his forefathers. If\r\nthe historic annals of Mewar record acts of unexampled severity, they\r\nare not without instances of unparalleled devotion. The minister of\r\nPartap, whose ancestors had for ages held the office, placed at his\r\nprince’s disposal their accumulated wealth, which, with other resources,\r\nis stated to have been equivalent to the maintenance of twenty-five\r\nthousand men for twelve years. The name of Bhama Sah is preserved as the\r\nsaviour of Mewar. With this splendid proof of gratitude, and the\r\n_sirvente_ of Prithiraj as incitements, he again “screwed his courage to\r\nthe sticking-place,” collected his bands, and while his foes imagined\r\nthat he was endeavouring to effect a retreat through the desert,\r\nsurprised Shahbaz in his camp at Dawer, whose troops were cut in pieces.\r\nThe fugitives were pursued to Amet, the garrison of which shared the\r\nsame fate. Ere they could recover from their consternation, Kumbhalmer\r\nwas assaulted and taken; Abdulla and his garrison were put to the sword,\r\nand thirty-two fortified posts in like manner carried by surprise, the\r\ntroops being put to death without mercy. To use the words of the annals:\r\n\"Partap made a desert of Mewar; he made an [347] offering to the sword\r\nof whatever dwelt in its plains\": an appalling but indispensable\r\nsacrifice. In one short campaign (S. 1586, A.D. 1530), he had recovered\r\nall Mewar, except Chitor, Ajmer, and Mandalgarh; and determining to have\r\na slight ovation in return for the triumph Raja Man had enjoyed (who had\r\nfulfilled to the letter his threat, that Partap should “live in peril”),\r\nhe invaded Amber, and sacked its chief mart of commerce, Malpura.\r\n\r\nUdaipur was also regained; though this acquisition was so unimportant as\r\nscarcely to merit remark. In all likelihood it was abandoned from the\r\ndifficulty of defending it, when all around had submitted to Partap;\r\nthough the annals ascribe it to a generous sentiment of Akbar, prompted\r\nby the great Khankhanan, whose mind appears to have been captivated by\r\nthe actions of the Rajput prince.[4.11.40] An anecdote is appended to\r\naccount for Akbar’s relaxation of severity, but it is of too romantic a\r\nnature even for this part of their annals.\r\n\r\n=Mewār left in Peace by the Imperialists.=—Partap was indebted to a\r\ncombination of causes for the repose he enjoyed during the latter years\r\nof his life; and though this may be ascribed principally to the new\r\nfields of ambition which occupied the Mogul arms, we are authorized also\r\nto admit the full weight of the influence that the conduct of the Hindu\r\nprince exerted upon Akbar, together with the general sympathy of his\r\nfellow-princes, who swelled the train of the conqueror, and who were too\r\npowerful to be regarded with indifference.\r\n\r\nRepose was, however, no boon to the noblest of his race. A mind like\r\nPartap’s could enjoy no tranquillity while, from the summit of the pass\r\nwhich guarded Udaipur, his eye embraced the Kunguras of Chitor, to which\r\nhe must ever be a stranger. To a soul like his, burning for the\r\nredemption of the glory of his race, the mercy thus shown him, in\r\nplacing a limit to his hopes, was more difficult of endurance than the\r\npangs of fabled Tantalus. Imagine the warrior, yet in manhood’s prime,\r\nbroken with fatigues and covered with scars, from amidst the fragments\r\nof basaltic ruin[4.11.41] (fit emblem of his own condition!), casting a\r\nwistful eye to [348] the rock stained with the blood of his fathers;\r\nwhilst in the ‘dark chamber’ of his mind the scenes of glory enacted\r\nthere appeared with unearthly lustre. First, the youthful Bappa, on\r\nwhose head was the ‘mor he had won from the Mori’:[4.11.42] the warlike\r\nSamarsi, arming for the last day of Rajput independence, to die with\r\nPrithiraj on the banks of the Ghaggar: again, descending the steep of\r\nChitor, the twelve sons of Arsi, the crimson banner floating around\r\neach, while from the embattled rock the guardian goddess looked down on\r\nthe carnage which secured a perpetuity of sway. Again, in all the pomp\r\nof sacrifice, the Deolia chiefs, Jaimall and Patta; and like the Pallas\r\nof Rajasthan, the Chondawat dame, leading her daughter into the ranks of\r\ndestruction: examples for their sons’ and husbands’ imitation. At length\r\nclouds of darkness dimmed the walls of Chitor: from her battlements\r\n‘Kungura Rani’[4.11.43] had fled; the tints of dishonour began to blend\r\nwith the visions of glory; and lo! Udai Singh appeared flying from the\r\nrock to which the honour of his house was united. Aghast at the picture\r\nhis fancy had portrayed, imagine him turning to the contemplation of his\r\nown desolate condition, indebted for a cessation of persecution to the\r\nmost revolting sentiment that can assail an heroic mind—compassion;\r\ncompared with which scorn is endurable, contempt even enviable: these he\r\ncould retaliate; but for the high-minded, the generous Rajput, to be the\r\nobject of that sickly sentiment, pity, was more oppressive than the arms\r\nof his foe.\r\n\r\n=The Last Days of Rāna Partāp.=—A premature decay assailed the pride of\r\nRajasthan; a mind diseased preyed on an exhausted frame, and prostrated\r\nhim in the very summer of his days. The last moments of Partap were an\r\nappropriate commentary on his life, which he terminated, like the\r\nCarthaginian, swearing his successor to eternal conflict against the\r\nfoes of his country’s independence. But the Rajput prince had not the\r\nsame joyful assurance that inspired the Numidian Hamilcar; for his end\r\nwas clouded with the presentiment that his son Amra would abandon his\r\nfame for inglorious repose. A powerful sympathy is excited by the\r\npicture which is drawn of this final scene. The dying hero is\r\nrepresented in a lowly dwelling; his chiefs, the faithful companions of\r\nmany a glorious day, awaiting round his pallet the dissolution of their\r\nprince, when a groan of mental anguish made Salumbar inquire [349],\r\n“What afflicted his soul that it would not depart in peace?” He rallied:\r\n“It lingered,” he said, “for some consolatory pledge that his country\r\nshould not be abandoned to the Turk”; and with the death-pang upon him,\r\nhe related an incident which had guided his estimate of his son’s\r\ndisposition, and now tortured him with the reflection that for personal\r\nease he would forgo the remembrance of his own and his country’s wrongs.\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the Pichola, Partap and his chiefs had constructed a few\r\nhuts[4.11.44] (the site of the future palace of Udaipur), to protect\r\nthem during the inclemency of the rains in the day of their distress.\r\nPrince Amra, forgetting the lowliness of the dwelling, a projecting\r\nbamboo of the roof caught the folds of his turban and dragged it off as\r\nhe retired. A hasty emotion, which disclosed a varied feeling, was\r\nobserved with pain by Partap, who thence adopted the opinion that his\r\nson would never withstand the hardships necessary to be endured in such\r\na cause. “These sheds,” said the dying prince, “will give way to\r\nsumptuous dwellings, thus generating the love of ease; and luxury with\r\nits concomitants will ensue, to which the independence of Mewar, which\r\nwe have bled to maintain, will be sacrificed: and you, my chiefs, will\r\nfollow the pernicious example.” They pledged themselves, and became\r\nguarantees for the prince, “by the throne of Bappa Rawal,” that they\r\nwould not permit mansions to be raised till Mewar had recovered her\r\nindependence. The soul of Partap was satisfied, and with joy he expired.\r\n\r\nThus closed the life of a Rajput whose memory is even now idolized by\r\nevery Sesodia, and will continue to be so, till renewed oppression shall\r\nextinguish the remaining sparks of patriotic feeling. May that day never\r\narrive! yet if such be her destiny, may it, at least, not be hastened by\r\nthe arms of Britain!\r\n\r\nIt is worthy the attention of those who influence the destinies of\r\nStates in more favoured climes, to estimate the intensity of feeling\r\nwhich could arm this prince to oppose the resources of a small\r\nprincipality against the then most powerful empire of the world, whose\r\narmies were more numerous and far more efficient than any ever led by\r\nthe Persian against the liberties of Greece. Had Mewar possessed her\r\nThucydides or her Xenophon, neither the wars of the Peloponnesus nor the\r\nretreat of the ‘ten thousand’ would have yielded more diversified\r\nincidents for [350] the historic muse, than the deeds of this brilliant\r\nreign amid the many vicissitudes of Mewar. Undaunted heroism, inflexible\r\nfortitude, that which ‘keeps honour bright,’ perseverance,—with fidelity\r\nsuch as no nation can boast, were the materials opposed to a soaring\r\nambition, commanding talents, unlimited means, and the fervour of\r\nreligious zeal; all, however, insufficient to contend with one\r\nunconquerable mind. There is not a pass in the alpine Aravalli that is\r\nnot sanctified by some deed of Partap,—some brilliant victory or,\r\noftener, more glorious defeat.

When the\r\n  Mullah was gone, the monarch erased the emendation and re-inserted the\r\n  passage. An Omrah had observed and questioned the action, to which the\r\n  king replied: “It was better to make a blot in the manuscript than\r\n  wound the vanity of a humble scholar.” [Ferishta tells the story of\r\n  Nāsiru-d-dīn Mahmūd, i. 246.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.11.37:\r\n\r\n  [Compare the later accounts of these fairs by Bernier 272 f.; and\r\n  Manucci i. 195.

It is a\r\n  well-known fact, also, that the younger son in these regions inherited\r\n  a greater share than the elder, which is attributed to their pastoral\r\n  habits, which invited early emigration in the elder sons. This habit\r\n  prevailed with the Rajput tribes of very early times, and the annals\r\n  of the Yadus, a race allied to the Yuti-Getae, or Jāt, afford many\r\n  instances of it. Modified it yet exists amongst the Jarejas (of the\r\n  same stock), with whom the sons divide equally; which custom was\r\n  transmitted to Europe by these Getic hordes, and brought into England\r\n  by the _Jut_ brothers, who founded the kingdom of Kent (_kanthi_, ‘a\r\n  coast’ in Gothic and Sanskrit), where it is yet known as _Gavelkind_.\r\n  In English law it is termed _borough-English_. In Scotland it existed\r\n  in barbarous times, analogous to those when the Nauroza was\r\n  sanctioned; and the lord of the manor had privileges which rendered it\r\n  more than doubtful whether the first-born was natural heir: hence, the\r\n  youngest was the heir. So in France, in ancient times; and though the\r\n  ‘_droit de Jambage_’ no longer exists, the term sufficiently denotes\r\n  the extent of privilege, in comparison with which the other rights of\r\n  ‘_Noçages_,’ the seigneur’s feeding his greyhounds with the best\r\n  dishes and insulting the bride’s blushes with ribald songs, were\r\n  innocent.

From the early age of eight to\r\nthe hour of his parent’s death, he had been his constant companion and\r\nthe partner of his toils and dangers. Initiated by his noble sire in\r\nevery act of mountain strife, familiar with its perils, he entered on\r\nhis career[4.12.1] in the very flower of manhood, already attended by\r\nsons able to maintain whatever his sword might recover of his patrimony.\r\n\r\nAkbar, the greatest foe of Mewar, survived Partap nearly eight\r\nyears.[4.12.2] The vast field in which he had to exert the resources of\r\nhis mind, necessarily withdrew him from a scene where even success ill\r\nrepaid the sacrifices made to attain it. Amra was left in perfect repose\r\nduring the remainder of this monarch’s life, which it was not wisdom to\r\ndisturb by the renewal of a contest against the colossal power of the\r\nMogul. An extended reign of more than half a century permitted Akbar to\r\nconsolidate the vast empire he had erected, and to model the form of his\r\n[351] government, which displays, as handed down by Abu-l Fazl, an\r\nincontestable proof of his genius as well as of his natural beneficence.\r\nNor would the Mogul lose, on being contrasted with the contemporary\r\nprinces of Europe: with Henry IV. of France, who, like himself, ascended\r\na throne weakened by dissension; with Charles V., alike aspiring to\r\nuniversal sway: or the glorious queen of our own isle, who made advances\r\nto Akbar and sent him an embassy.[4.12.3] Akbar was fortunate as either\r\nHenry or Elizabeth in the choice of his ministers. The lofty integrity,\r\nmilitary genius, and habits of civil industry, for which Sully was\r\ndistinguished, found their parallel in Bairam; and if Burleigh equalled\r\nin wisdom, he was not superior in virtue to Abu-l Fazl, nor possessed of\r\nhis excessive benevolence. Unhappily for Mewar, all this genius and\r\npower combined to overwhelm her. It is, however, a proud tribute to the\r\nmemory of the Mogul that his name is united with that of his rival\r\nPartap in numerous traditionary couplets honourable to both; and if the\r\nRajput bard naturally emblazons first on his page that of his own hero,\r\nhe admits that none other but Akbar can stand a comparison with him;\r\nthereby confirming the eulogy of the historian of his race, who, in\r\nsumming up his character, observes that, “if he sometimes did things\r\nbeneath the dignity of a great king, he never did anything unworthy of a\r\ngood man.” But if the annalist of the Bundi State can be relied upon,\r\nthe very act which caused Akbar’s death will make us pause ere we\r\nsubscribe to these testimonies to the worth of departed greatness, and,\r\ndisregarding the adage of only speaking good of the dead, compel us to\r\ninstitute, in imitation of the ancient Egyptians, a posthumous inquest\r\non the character of the monarch of the Moguls. The Bundi records are\r\nwell worthy of belief, as diaries of events were kept by her princes,\r\nwho were of the first importance in this and the succeeding reigns: and\r\nthey may be more likely to throw a light upon points of character of a\r\ntendency to disgrace the Mogul king, than the historians of his court,\r\nwho had every reason to withhold such. A desire to be rid of the great\r\nRaja Man of Amber, to whom he was so much indebted, made the emperor\r\ndescend [352] to act the part of the assassin. He prepared a _ma’ajun_,\r\nor confection, a part of which contained poison; but, caught in his own\r\nsnare, he presented the innoxious portion to the Rajput and ate that\r\ndrugged with death himself.[4.12.4] We have a sufficient clue to the\r\nmotives which influenced Akbar to a deed so unworthy of him, and which\r\nwere more fully developed in the reign of his successor; namely, a\r\ndesign on the part of Raja Man to alter the succession, and that Khusru,\r\nhis nephew, should succeed instead of Salim. With such a motive, the\r\naged emperor might have admitted with less scruple the advice which\r\nprompted an act he dared not openly undertake, without exposing the\r\nthrone in his latter days to the dangers of civil contention, as Raja\r\nMan was too powerful to be openly assaulted.\r\n\r\n=The Administration of Rāna Amar Singh.=—Let us return to Mewar. Amra\r\nremodelled the institutions of his country, made a new assessment of the\r\nlands and distribution of the fiefs, apportioning the service to the\r\ntimes. He also established the gradation of ranks such as yet exists,\r\nand regulated the sumptuary laws even to the tie of a turban,[4.12.5]\r\nand many of these are to be seen engraved on pillars of stone in various\r\nparts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe repose thus enjoyed realized the prophetic fears of Partap, whose\r\nadmonitions were forgotten. Amra constructed a small palace on the banks\r\nof the lake, named after himself ‘the abode of immortality,’[4.12.6]\r\nstill remarkable for its Gothic contrast to the splendid marble edifice\r\nerected by his successors, now the abode of the princes of Mewar.\r\n\r\n=Jahāngīr attacks Mewār.=—Jahangir had been four years on the throne,\r\nand having overcome all internal dissension, resolved to signalize his\r\nreign by the subjugation of the only prince who had disdained to\r\nacknowledge the paramount power of the Moguls; and assembling the royal\r\nforces, he put them in motion for Mewar.\r\n\r\nAmra, between the love of ease and reputation, wavered as to the conduct\r\nhe should adopt; nor were sycophants wanting who\r\n\r\n              Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth,\r\n              Not peace:\r\n\r\nand dared to prompt his following the universal contagion, by accepting\r\nthe imperial farman. In such a state of mind the chiefs found their\r\nprince, when [353] they repaired to the new abode to warn him, and\r\nprepare him for the emergency. But the gallant Chondawat, recalling to\r\ntheir remembrance the dying behest of their late glorious head, demanded\r\nits fulfilment. All resolved to imitate the noble Partap,\r\n\r\n                               ... preferring\r\n                   Hard liberty before the easy yoke\r\n                   Of servile pomp.\r\n\r\n=Chief of Salūmbar intervenes.=—A magnificent mirror of European\r\nfabrication adorned the embryo palace. Animated with a noble resentment\r\nat the inefficacy of his appeal to the better feelings of his prince,\r\nthe chieftain of Salumbar hurled ‘the slave of the carpet’[4.12.7]\r\nagainst the splendid bauble, and starting up, seized his sovereign by\r\nthe arm and moved him from the throne. “To horse, chiefs!” he exclaimed,\r\n“and preserve from infamy the son of Partap.” A burst of passion\r\nfollowed the seeming indignity, and the patriot chief was branded with\r\nthe harsh name of traitor; but with his sacred duty in view, and\r\nsupported by every vassal of note, he calmly disregarded the insult.\r\nCompelled to mount his steed, and surrounded by the veterans and all the\r\nchivalry of Mewar, Amra’s passion vented itself in tears of indignation.\r\nIn such a mood the cavalcade descended the ridge, since studded with\r\npalaces, and had reached the spot where the temple of Jagannath now\r\nstands, when he recovered from this fit of passion; the tear ceased to\r\nflow, and passing his hand over his moustache,[4.12.8] he made a\r\ncourteous salutation to all, entreating their forgiveness for this\r\nomission of respect; but more especially expressing his gratitude to\r\nSalumbar, he said, “Lead on, nor shall you ever have to regret your late\r\nsovereign.” Elevated with every sentiment of generosity and valour, they\r\npassed on to Dawer, where they encountered the royal army led by the\r\nbrother of the Khankhanan, as it entered the pass, and which, after a\r\nlong and sanguinary combat, they entirely defeated.[4.12.9]\r\n\r\n=Defeat of the Imperialists.=—The honours of the day are chiefly\r\nattributed to the brave Kana, uncle to the Rana, and ancestor of that\r\nnumerous clan called after him Kanawats. A truce followed this battle,\r\nbut it was of short duration; for another and yet more murderous\r\nconflict took place in the spring of 1666, in the pass of the sacred\r\nRanpur [354], where the imperial army, under its leader Abdulla, was\r\nalmost exterminated;[4.12.10] though with the loss of the best and\r\nbravest of the chiefs of Mewar, whose names, however harsh, deserve\r\npreservation.[4.12.11] A feverish exultation was the fruit of this\r\nvictory, which shed a hectic flush of glory over the declining days of\r\nMewar, when the crimson banner once more floated throughout the province\r\nof Godwar.\r\n\r\n=Jahāngīr establishes Sagra as Rāna.=—Alarmed at these successive\r\ndefeats, Jahangir, preparatory to equipping a fresh army against Mewar,\r\ndetermined to establish a new Rana, and to instal him in the ancient\r\nseat of power, Chitor, thus hoping to withdraw from the standard of Amra\r\nmany of his adherents. The experiment evinced at least a knowledge of\r\ntheir prejudices; but, to the honour of Rajput fidelity, it failed.\r\nSagra, who abandoned Partap and went over to Akbar, was\r\nselected;[4.12.12] the sword of investiture was girded on him by the\r\nemperor’s own hands, and under the escort of a Mogul force he went to\r\nreign amidst the ruins of Chitor. Her grandeur, even in desolation, is\r\nbeautifully depicted at this very period by the chaplain to the embassy\r\nfrom Elizabeth to Jahangir, the members composing which visited the\r\ncapital of the Sesodias in their route to Ajmer.[4.12.13]\r\n\r\nFor seven years Sagra had a spurious homage paid to him amidst this\r\ndesolation, the ruined pride of his ancestors. But it is gratifying to\r\nrecord, that not even by this recreant son of Chitor could the\r\nimpressions formed in contemplating such scenes be resisted; and Sagra,\r\nthough flinty as the rock to a brother and nephew, could not support the\r\nsilent admonition of the altars of the heroes who had fallen in her\r\ndefence. The triumphal column raised for victory over a combination of\r\n[355] kings, was a perpetual memento of his infamy; nor could he pass\r\nover one finger’s breadth of her ample surface, without treading on some\r\nfragment which reminded him of their great deeds and his own\r\nunworthiness. We would be desirous of recording, that a nobler\r\nremembrancer than ‘coward conscience,’ animated the brother of Partap to\r\nan act of redeeming virtue; but when the annals tell us, that “the\r\nterrific Bhairon (the god of battle) openly manifested his displeasure,”\r\nit is decisive that it was not less the wish for greatness, than the\r\ndesire to be “without the illness should attend it”; and sending for his\r\nnephew, he restored to him Chitor, retiring to the isolated\r\nKandhar.[4.12.14] Some time after, upon going to court, and being\r\nupbraided by Jahangir, he drew his dagger and slew himself in the\r\nemperor’s presence: an end worthy of such a traitor.[4.12.15]\r\n\r\n=Conquests of Rāna Amar Singh I.=—Amra took possession of the seat of\r\nhis ancestors; but wanting the means to put it in defence, the\r\nacquisition only served to increase the temporary exultation. The evil\r\nresulting from attaching so much consequence to a capital had been often\r\nsignally manifested; as to harass the enemy from their mountains, and\r\nthereby render his conquests unavailing, was the only policy which could\r\nafford the chance of independence. With Chitor the Rana acquired, by\r\nsurrender or assault, possession of no less than eighty of the chief\r\ntowns and fortresses of Mewar: amongst them Untala, at whose capture\r\noccurred the patriotic struggle between the clans of Chondawat and\r\nSaktawat for the leading of the vanguard, elsewhere related.[4.12.16] On\r\nthis memorable storm, besides the leaders of the rival bands, five of\r\nthe infant clan Saktawat, consisting but of sixteen brave brothers, with\r\nthree of the house of Salumbar, perished, struggling for the immortality\r\npromised by the bard. We may here relate the rise of the Saktawats, with\r\nwhich is materially connected the future history of Mewar.\r\n\r\n=Sakta and the Saktāwats.=—Sakta was the second of the twenty-four sons\r\nof Udai Singh. When only five years of age, he discovered that fearless\r\ntemperament which marked his manhood [356]. The armourer having brought\r\na new dagger to try its edge by the usual proof on thinly spread cotton,\r\nthe child asked the Rana “if it was not intended to cut bones and\r\nflesh,” and seizing it, tried it on his own little hand. The blood\r\ngushed on the carpet, but he betrayed no symptom of pain or surprise.\r\nWhether his father admitted the tacit reproof of his own want of nerve,\r\nor that it recalled the prediction of the astrologers, who, in casting\r\nSakta’s horoscope, had announced that he was to be “the bane of Mewar,”\r\nhe was incontinently commanded to be put to death, and was carried off\r\nfor this purpose, when saved by the Salumbar chief, who arrested the\r\nfiat, sped to the Rana, and begged his life as a boon, promising, having\r\nno heirs, to educate him as the future head of the Chondawats. The\r\nSalumbar chief had children in his old age, and while wavering between\r\nhis own issue and the son of his adoption, the young Sakta was sent for\r\nto court by his brother Partap. The brothers for a considerable time\r\nlived on the most amicable footing, unhappily interrupted by a dispute\r\nwhile hunting, which in time engendered mutual dislike. While riding in\r\nthe ring, Partap suddenly proposed to decide their quarrel by single\r\ncombat, “to see who was the best lancer.” Not backward, Sakta replied,\r\n“Do you begin”; and some little time was lost in a courteous struggle\r\nfor the first spear, when, as they took their ground and agreed to\r\ncharge together, the Purohit[4.12.17] rushed between the combatants and\r\nimplored them not to ruin the house. His appeal, however, being vain,\r\nthere was but one way left to prevent the unnatural strife: the priest\r\ndrew his dagger, and plunging it in his breast, fell a lifeless corpse\r\nbetween the combatants. Appalled at the horrid deed, ‘the blood of the\r\npriest on their head,’ they desisted from their infatuated aim. Partap,\r\nwaving his hand, commanded Sakta to quit his dominions, who bowing\r\nretired, and carried his resentments to Akbar. Partap performed with the\r\nobsequies of this faithful servant many expiatory rites, and made an\r\nirrevocable grant of Salera to his son, still enjoyed by his\r\ndescendants, while a small column yet identifies the spot of sacrifice\r\nto fidelity. From that hour to the memorable day when the founder of the\r\nSaktawats gained the birad of the race ‘_Khurasan Multan ka Aggal_,’ on\r\nthe occasion of his saving his sovereign flying from the field, the\r\nbrothers had never beheld each other’s face [357].\r\n\r\nSakta had seventeen sons, all of whom, excepting the heir of\r\nBhainsror,[4.12.18] attended his obsequies. On return from this rite\r\nthey found the gates barred against them by Bhanji, now chief of the\r\nSaktawats, who told them “there were too many mouths,” and that they\r\nmust push their fortunes elsewhere while he attended his sovereign with\r\nthe quota of Bhainsror. They demanded their horses and their arms, if\r\nsuch were his pleasure; and electing Achal as their head (whose wife was\r\nthen pregnant), they took the route to Idar, which had recently been\r\nacquired by a junior branch of the Rathors of Marwar.[4.12.19] They had\r\nreached Palod when the pangs of childbirth seized the wife of Achal; and\r\nbeing rudely repulsed by the Sonigira vassal of Palod, who refused her\r\nshelter at such a moment, they sought refuge amidst the ruins of a\r\ntemple.[4.12.20] It was the shrine of Mata Janavi, ‘the mother of\r\nbirths,’ the Juno Lucina of the Rajputs. In a corner of the sanctuary\r\nthey placed the mother of a future race; but the rain, which fell in\r\ntorrents, visibly affected the ruin. A beam of stone gave way, which but\r\nfor Bala would have crushed her: he supported the sinking roof on his\r\nhead till the brothers cut down a babul tree, with which they propped it\r\nand relieved him. In this retreat Asa (_Hope_) was born, who became the\r\nparent of an extensive branch known as the Achalis Saktawats.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Great Mother’ was propitious. The parent of ‘_Hope_’ was soon\r\nenabled to resume her journey for Idar, whose chief received them with\r\nopen arms, and assigned lands for their support. Here they had been some\r\ntime when the Rana’s prime minister passed through Idar from a\r\npilgrimage to Satrunjaya.[4.12.21] A violent storm would have thrown\r\ndown the tent in which was his wife, but for the exertion of some of the\r\nbrothers; and the minister, on learning that it was to the near kin of\r\nhis sovereign he was indebted for this kindness, invited them to\r\nUdaipur, taking upon him to provide for them with their own proper head,\r\nwhich they declined without a special invitation. This was not long\r\nwanting; for Amra [358] was then collecting the strength of his hills\r\nagainst the king, and the services of the band of brothers, his kinsmen,\r\nwere peculiarly acceptable. The first act of duty, though humble, is\r\nproperly recorded, as ennobled by the sentiment which inspired it, and\r\nthe pictured scene is yet preserved of Bala and Jodha collecting logs of\r\nwood for a night fire in the mountain bivouac for their kinsman and\r\nsovereign. In the more brilliant exploit which followed Bala took the\r\nlead, and though the lord of Bhainsror was in camp, it was Bala who\r\nobtained the leading of the vanguard: the commencement of that rivalry\r\nof clanship from whence have resulted some of the most daring, and many\r\nof the most merciless deeds in the history of Mewar. The right to lead\r\nin battle belonged to the Chondawats, and the first intimation the\r\nchieftain had of his prince’s inconsiderate insult was from the bard\r\nincessantly repeating the ‘birad’ of the clan, until ‘the portal of the\r\nten thousand’ of Mewar deemed him mad. “Not so,” replied he; “but it is,\r\nperhaps, the last time your ears may be gratified with the watchword of\r\nChonda, which may to-morrow be given as well as the Harawal to the\r\nSaktawats.” An explanation followed, and the assault of Untala ensued,\r\nwhich preserved the rights of the Chondawats, though nobly contested by\r\ntheir rivals. The vassal of Bakrol carried the tidings of the successful\r\nassault to the Rana, who arrived in time to receive the last obeisance\r\nof Bala, whose parting words to his prince were seized on by the bard\r\nand added to the birad of the clan: and although, in sloth and opium,\r\nthey now “lose and neglect the creeping hours of time,” yet whenever a\r\nSaktawat chief enters the court of his sovereign, or takes his seat\r\namongst his brother chiefs, the bards still salute him with the dying\r\nwords of Bala:\r\n\r\n                  \"_Dūna dātār.\r\n                  Chauguna junjhār,\r\n                  Khurāsān Multān ka āggāl._\"[4.12.22]\r\n\r\nThen passing the hand over his moustache, for a moment the escalade of\r\nUntala flits before his vision, where Bala, Achalis, Jodha, Dilla, and\r\nChaturbhan, five of the seventeen sons of Sakta, fell for the\r\nmaintenance of the post of honour [359]. Bhanji soon after performed a\r\nservice which obtained him the entire favour of his prince, who,\r\nreturning from Ratlam, was insulted by the Rathors of Bhindar, which was\r\npunished by the Saktawat, who took the town by assault, expelling the\r\naggressors. Amra added it to his fief of Bhainsror, and since the latter\r\nwas bestowed on the rival clan, Bhindar has continued the chief\r\nresidence of the leader of the Saktawats. Ten chiefs[4.12.23] have\r\nfollowed in regular succession, whose issue spread over Mewar, so that\r\nin a few generations after Sakta, their prince could muster the swords\r\nof ten thousand Saktawats; but internal feuds and interminable\r\nspoliation have checked the progress of population, and it might be\r\ndifficult now to assemble half that number of the ‘children of Sakta’\r\nfit to bear arms.\r\n\r\n=Renewed Attack by Jahāngīr. Battle of Khāmnor.=—To return. These\r\ndefeats alarmed Jahangir, who determined to equip an overwhelming force\r\nto crush the Rana. To this end he raised the imperial standard at Ajmer,\r\nand assembled the expedition under his immediate inspection, of which he\r\nappointed his son Parvez commander, with instructions on departure “that\r\nif the Rana or his elder son Karan should repair to him, to receive them\r\nwith becoming attention, and to offer no molestation to the\r\ncountry.”[4.12.24] But the Sesodia prince little thought of submission:\r\non the contrary, flushed with success, he gave the royal army the\r\nmeeting at a spot oft moistened with blood, the pass of\r\nKhamnor,[4.12.25] leading into the heart of the hills. The imperial army\r\nwas disgracefully beaten, and fled, pursued with great havoc, towards\r\nAjmer. The Mogul historian admits it to have been a glorious day for\r\nMewar. He describes Parvez entangled in the passes, dissensions in his\r\ncamp, his supplies cut off, and under all [360] these disadvantages\r\nattacked; his precipitate flight and pursuit, in which the royal army\r\nlost vast numbers of men.[4.12.26] But Jahangir in his diary slurs it\r\nover, and simply remarks: “Fearing that Khusrau’s affair might be\r\nprolonged, I ordered my son Parwīz to leave some of the Sardārs to look\r\nafter the Rānā, and to come to Agra with Āsaf Khān and a body of those\r\nnearly connected with him in the service.”[4.12.27]\r\n\r\nThis son, tutored by the great Mahabat Khan, fared no better than\r\nParvez; he was routed and slain. But the Hydra was indestructible; for\r\nevery victory, while it cost the best blood of Mewar, only multiplied\r\nthe number of her foes. Seventeen pitched battles had the illustrious\r\nRajput fought since the death of his father: but the loss of his\r\nexperienced veterans withered the laurels of victory, nor had he\r\nsufficient repose either to husband his resources or to rear his young\r\nheroes to replace them. Another and yet more mighty army was assembled\r\nunder Prince Khurram, the ablest of the sons of Jahangir, and better\r\nknown in history as Shah Jahan, when emperor of the Moguls.\r\n\r\nAgain did the Rana with his son Karan collect the might of their hills;\r\nbut a handful of warriors was all their muster to meet the host of\r\nDelhi, and the ‘crimson banner,’ which for more than eight hundred years\r\nhad waved in proud independence over the heads of the Guhilots, was now\r\nto be abased to the son of Jahangir. The Emperor’s own pen shall narrate\r\nthe termination of this strife.\r\n\r\n\"My chief object, after my visit to the Khwāja [the tomb of Mu’īnu-d-dīn\r\nChishti, the saint of Ajmer] was to put a stop to the affair of the\r\nrebel Rānā. On this account I determined to remain myself at Ajmīr and\r\nsend on Bābā Khurram, my fortunate son. This idea was a very good one,\r\nand on this account, on the 6th of Day [tenth month of the solar year]\r\nat the hour fixed on, I dispatched him in happiness and triumph. I\r\npresented him with a _qabā_ (outer coat) of gold brocade with jewelled\r\nflowers and pearls round the flowers, a brocaded turban with strings of\r\npearls, a gold woven sash with chains of pearls, one of my private\r\nelephants called Fath Gaj, with trappings, a splendid horse, a jewelled\r\nsword, with a _phūl katāra_ (dagger). In addition to the men first\r\nappointed to this duty under the leadership of Khān A’zam, I sent 12,000\r\nmore horse with my son, and honoured their _khil’at_ (wearing robes of\r\nhonour) leaders.\"[4.12.28]\r\n\r\nOn 14th Isfandārmuz [twelfth month of the solar year] \"a representation\r\ncame from my son Bābā Khurram that the elephant ‛Ālam Gumān [‘arrogant\r\nof the earth’], of which the Rānā was very fond, together with seventeen\r\n‛Ālamgumān other elephants, had fallen into the hands of the victorious\r\narmy.\"[4.12.29] Jahāngīr rode this elephant on the second day of the New\r\nYear, which began on 21st March 1614.[4.12.30]\r\n\r\n\"In the month of Bahman [eleventh solar month] there came pieces of good\r\nnews, one after the other. The first was that the Rānā Amar Singh had\r\nelected for obedience and service to the Court. The circumstances of\r\nthis affair are these. Sultān Khurram, by dint of placing a great many\r\nposts, especially in some places where most people said it was\r\nimpossible to place them on account of the badness of the air and water\r\nand the wild nature of the localities, and by dint of moving the royal\r\nforces one after another in pursuit, without regard to the heat or\r\nexcessive rain, and making prisoners of the inhabitants of that region,\r\nbrought matters with the Rānā to such a pass that it became clear to him\r\nthat if this should happen to him again he must either fly the country\r\nor be made prisoner. Being without remedy, he chose obedience and\r\nloyalty, and sent to my fortunate son his maternal uncle Subhkaran, with\r\nHaridās Jhālā, who was one of the two men in his confidence, and\r\npetitioned that if that fortunate son would ask forgiveness for his\r\noffences and tranquillize his mind, and obtain for him the auspicious\r\nsign-manual (_panja_,[4.12.31] the mark of the Emperor’s five fingers),\r\nhe would himself wait on my son, and would send his son and successor,\r\nKaran Singh, or he, after the manner of other Rājas, would be enrolled\r\namong the servants of the Court and do service. He also begged that he\r\nhimself might be excused from coming to Court on account of his old age.\r\nAccordingly, my son sent them in company with his own Dīwān, Mullā\r\nShukru-llah, whom after the conclusion of this business I dignified with\r\nthe title of Afzal Khān, and Sundar Dās, his major-domo, who, after the\r\nmatter was settled, was honoured with the title of Rāy Rayān, to the\r\nexalted Court, and represented the circumstances. My lofty mind was\r\nalways desirous, as far as possible, not to destroy the old families.\r\nThe real point was that as Rānā Amar Singh and his fathers, proud in the\r\nstrength of the hilly country and their abodes, had never seen or obeyed\r\nany of the kings of Hindustan, this should be brought about in my reign.\r\nAt the request of my son, I forgave the Rānā’s offences, and gave a\r\ngracious farmān that should satisfy him, and impressed on it the mark of\r\nmy auspicious palm. I also wrote a farmān of kindness to my son that if\r\nhe could arrange to settle the matter I should be much pleased. My son\r\nalso sent them [perhaps the uncle and Haridās, or the farmāns] with\r\nMullā Shukru-llah and Sundar Dās to the Rānā to console him and make him\r\nhopeful of the royal favour. They gave him the gracious farmān with the\r\nsign-manual of the auspicious hand, and it was settled that on Sunday,\r\nthe 26th of the month Bahman, he and his sons should come and pay their\r\nrespects to my son.\"[4.12.32]\r\n\r\n\"In the end of this month, when I was employed in hunting in the\r\nenvirons of Ajmīr, Muhammad Beg, an attendant on my fortunate son Sultān\r\nKhurram, came and brought a report from that son, and stated that the\r\nRānā had come with his sons and paid his respects to the prince: the\r\ndetails would be made known by the report. I immediately turned the face\r\nof supplication to the Divine Court, and prostrated myself in\r\nthanksgiving. I presented a horse, an elephant, and a jewelled dagger to\r\nthe aforesaid Muhammad Khān, and honoured him with the title of\r\nZu-l-faqār Khān [‘Lord of the sword’].\"[4.12.33]\r\n\r\n\"From the report it appeared that on Sunday the 26th Bahman, the Rānā\r\npaid his respects to my fortunate son with the politeness and ritual\r\nthat servants pay their respects, and produced as offerings a famous\r\nlarge ruby that was in his house, with some decorated articles and seven\r\nelephants, some of them fit for the private stud, and which had not\r\nfallen into our hands, and were the only ones left him, and nine horses.\r\nMy son also behaved to him with perfect kindness. When the Rānā clasped\r\nhis feet and asked forgiveness for his faults, he took his hand and\r\nplaced it on his breast, and consoled him in such a manner as to comfort\r\nhim. He presented him with a superb dress of honour, a jewelled sword, a\r\nhorse with a jewelled saddle, and a private elephant with silver\r\nhousings, and as there were not more than 100 men with him who were\r\nworthy of complete robes of honour, he gave 100 _sarupā_ [dresses] and\r\n50 horses and 12 jewelled _khapwā_ [daggers]. As it is the custom of the\r\nZamīndārs[4.12.34] that the son who is the heir-apparent should not go\r\nwith his father to pay his respects to a king or prince,[4.12.35] the\r\nRānā observed this custom, and did not bring with him Karan, the son who\r\nhad received the _tīkā_ [forehead mark of inauguration]. As the hour\r\n(fixed by astrology) of his departure of that son of lofty fortune from\r\nthat place was the end of that same day, he gave him leave, so that,\r\nhaving himself gone, he might send Karan to pay his respects. To him\r\nalso he gave a superb dress of honour, a jewelled sword and dagger, a\r\nhorse with a gold saddle, and a special elephant, and on the same day,\r\ntaking Karan in attendance, he proceeded towards the illustrious\r\nCourt.\"[4.12.36]\r\n\r\n\"In my interview with Sultan Khurram on his arrival at Ajmer,[4.12.37]\r\nhe represented that if it was my pleasure he would present the prince\r\nKaran, whom I accordingly desired him to bring. He arrived, paid his\r\nrespects, _and his rank was commanded to be, at the request of my son,\r\nimmediately on my right hand_, and I rewarded him with suitable khilats.\r\nAs Karan, owing to the rude life he had led in his native hills, was\r\nextremely shy, and unused to the pageantry and experience of a court, in\r\norder to reconcile and give him confidence I daily gave him some\r\ntestimonies of my regard and protection, and in the second day of his\r\nservice I gave him a jewelled dagger, and on the third a choice steed of\r\nIrak with rich caparisons; and on the same day, I took him with me to\r\nthe queen’s court, when the queen, Nur Jahan, made him splendid khilats,\r\nelephant and horse caparisoned, sword, etc. The same day I gave him a\r\nrich necklace of pearls, another day an elephant, and it was my wish to\r\ngive him rarities and choice things of every kind. I gave him three\r\nroyal hawks and three gentle falcons trained to the hand,[4.12.38] coat\r\nof mail, chain and plate armour, and two rings of value; and, on the\r\nlast day of the month, carpets, state cushions, perfumes, vessels of\r\ngold, and a pair of the bullocks of Gujarat.[4.12.39]\r\n\r\n\"10th year.[4.12.40] At this time I gave prince Karan leave to return to\r\nhis jagir;[4.12.41] when I bestowed on him an elephant, horse, and a\r\npearl necklace valued at 50,000 rupees (£5000); and from the day of his\r\nrepairing to my court to that of his departure, the value of the various\r\ngifts I presented him exceeded ten lakhs of rupees (£125,000), exclusive\r\nof one hundred and ten horses, five elephants, or what my son Khurram\r\ngave him. I sent Mubarik Khan along with [364] him, by whom I sent an\r\nelephant, horse, etc., and various confidential messages to the Rana.\r\n\r\n\"On the 8th Safar[4.12.42] of the 10th year of the H. 1024 Karan was\r\nelevated to the dignity of a Mansabdar[4.12.43] of five thousand, when I\r\npresented him with a bracelet of pearls, in which was a ruby of great\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n\"24th Muharram,[4.12.44] 10th year (A.D. 1615), Jagat Sing, son of\r\nKaran, aged twelve years, arrived at court and paid his respects, and\r\npresented the arzis of his father and grandfather, Rana Amra Singh.\r\n_His countenance carried the impression of his illustrious\r\nextraction,[4.12.45] and I delighted his heart with presents and\r\nkindness._\r\n\r\n\"On the 10th Shaban,[4.12.46] Jagat Singh had permission to return to\r\nhis house. At his departure I presented him with 20,000 rupees, a horse,\r\nelephant, and khilats [365]; and to Haridas Jhala, preceptor of Prince\r\nKaran, 5000 rupees, a horse, and khilat; and I sent by him six golden\r\nimages[4.12.47] to the Rana.\r\n\r\n\"28th Rabiu-l-Ākhir,[4.12.48] 11th year. _The statues of the Rana and\r\nKaran, sculptured in white marble, I desired should have inscribed the\r\ndate in which they were prepared and presented, and commanded they\r\nshould be placed in the gardens at Agra._[4.12.49]\r\n\r\n\"In the 11th year of my reign an arzi from Itimad Khan acquainted me\r\nthat Sultan Khurram had entered the Rana’s country, and that prince and\r\nhis son had both exchanged visits with my son; and that from the\r\ntribute, consisting of seven elephants, twenty-seven saddle horses,\r\ntrays of jewels, and ornaments of gold, my son took three horses and\r\nreturned all the rest, and engaged that Prince Karan and fifteen hundred\r\nRajput horse should remain with him in the wars.\r\n\r\n\"In the 13th year Prince Karan repaired to my court, then at Sindla, to\r\ncongratulate me on my victories and conquest of the Deccan, and\r\npresented 100 mohars,[4.12.50] 1000 rupees, nazarana, and effects in\r\ngold and jewels to the amount of 21,000 rupees, hardy elephants and\r\nhorses; the last I returned, but kept the rest, and next day presented\r\nhim a dress of honour; and from Fatehpur gave him his leave, with\r\nelephant, horse, sword, and dagger, and a horse for his father.\r\n\r\n\"14th year of my reign. On the 17th Rabiu-l-awwal,[4.12.51] 1029 H., I\r\nreceived intelligence of the death of Rana Amra Singh.[4.12.52] To Jagat\r\nSingh, his grandson, and Bhim Singh, his son, in attendance, I gave\r\nkhilats, and dispatched Raja Kishordas[4.12.53] with the farman\r\nconferring benefits and with the dignity of Rana, the khilat of\r\ninvestiture, choice horses, and a letter of condolence suitable to the\r\noccasion to Prince Karan. 7th Shawwal.[4.12.54] Biharidas Brahman I\r\ndispatched with a [366] farman to Rana Karan, desiring that his son with\r\nhis contingent should attend me.\"\r\n\r\n=Treatment of the Rāna by Jahāngīr.=—To have generalized this detail of\r\nthe royal historian would have been to lessen the interest of this\r\nimportant period in the annals of Mewar. Jahangir merits to have his\r\nexultation, his noble and unostentatious conduct, described by his own\r\npen, the extreme minuteness of which description but increases the\r\ninterest. With his self-gratulation, he bears full testimony to the\r\ngallant and long-protracted resistance of the Rajputs; and while he\r\nimpartially, though rather erroneously, estimates their motives and\r\nmeans of opposition, he does Amra ample justice in the declaration, that\r\nhe did not yield until he had but the alternative of captivity or exile;\r\nand with a magnanimity above all praise, he records the Rajput prince’s\r\nsalvo for his dignity, “that he would hold himself excused from\r\nattending in person.” The simple and naïve declaration of his joy, \"his\r\ngoing abroad on ‛Alam Guman,\" the favourite elephant of the Rana which\r\nhad been captured, on learning his submission, is far stronger than the\r\nmost pompous testimony of public rejoicing. But there is a\r\nheart-stirring philanthropy in the conduct of the Mogul which does him\r\nimmortal honour; and in commanding his son “to treat the illustrious one\r\naccording to his heart’s wishes,” though he so long and so signally had\r\nfoiled the royal armies, he proved himself worthy of the good fortune he\r\nacknowledges, and well shows his sense of the superiority of the chief\r\nof all the Rajputs, by placing the heir of Mewar, even above all the\r\nprinces of his own house, ‘immediately on his right hand.’ Whether he\r\nattempts to relieve the shyness of Karan, or sets forth the princely\r\nappearance of Jagat Singh, we see the same amiable feeling operating to\r\nlighten the chains of the conquered. But the shyness of Karan deserved a\r\nworthier term: he felt the degradation which neither the statues raised\r\nto them, the right hand of the monarch, the dignity of a ‘commander of\r\nfive thousand,’ or even the restoration of the long-alienated territory\r\ncould neutralize, when the kingdom to which he was heir was called a\r\nfief (_jagir_), and himself, ‘the descendant of a hundred kings,’ a\r\nvassal (_jagirdar_) of the empire, under whose banner, which his\r\nancestors had so signally opposed, he was now to follow with a\r\ncontingent of fifteen hundred Rajput horse.\r\n\r\nSeldom has subjugated royalty met with such consideration; yet, to a\r\nlofty mind like Amra’s, this courteous condescension but increased the\r\nseverity of endurance [367]. In the bitterness of his heart he cursed\r\nthe magnanimity of Khurram, himself of Rajput blood[4.12.55] and an\r\nadmirer of Rajput valour, which circumstance more than the force of his\r\narms had induced him to surrender; for Khurram demanded but the\r\nfriendship of the Rajput as the price of peace, and to withdraw every\r\nMuhammadan from Mewar if the Rana would but receive the emperor’s farman\r\noutside of his capital. This his proud soul rejected; and though he\r\nvisited Prince Khurram as a friend, he spurned the proposition of\r\nacknowledging a superior, or receiving the rank and titles awaiting such\r\nan admission. The noble Amra, who—\r\n\r\n                               Rather than be less,\r\n                     Cared not to be at all—\r\n\r\ntook the resolution to abdicate[4.12.56] the throne he could no longer\r\nhold but at the will of another. Assembling his chiefs, and disclosing\r\nhis determination, he made the _tīka_ on his son’s forehead; and\r\nobserving that the honour of Mewar was now in his hands, forthwith left\r\nthe capital and secluded himself in the Nauchauki:[4.12.57] nor did he\r\nfrom that hour cross its threshold, but to have his ashes deposited with\r\nthose of his fathers.\r\n\r\n=Character of Rāna Amar Singh.=—All comment is superfluous on such a\r\ncharacter as Rana Amra. He was worthy of Partap and his race. He\r\npossessed all the physical as well as mental qualities of a hero, and\r\nwas the tallest and strongest of all the princes of Mewar. He was not so\r\nfair as they usually are, and he had a reserve bordering upon\r\ngloominess, doubtless occasioned by his reverses, for it was not natural\r\nto him; he was beloved by his chiefs for the qualities they most esteem,\r\ngenerosity and valour, and by his subjects for his justice and kindness,\r\nof which we can judge from his edicts, many of which yet live on the\r\ncolumn or the rock [368].\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.12.1:\r\n\r\n  S. 1653, A.D. 1597.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.12.2:\r\n\r\n  [It has now been established by Mr. V.

The\r\n  remains of this palace, about half a mile without the city wall\r\n  (north), on a cluster of hills, are yet in existence. It was built by\r\n  Udai Singh on the banks of a lake, under which are gardens and groves,\r\n  where the author had the Rana’s permission to pitch his tents in the\r\n  hottest months. [When Khurram was in revolt against his father, he\r\n  stayed at first in the Rāna’s palace; but as his followers little\r\n  respected Rājput prejudices, he removed to the Jagmandir, and the\r\n  island became his home till shortly before his father’s death (Erskine\r\n  ii. A. 109).]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 13\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rāna Karan Singh II., A.D. 1620-28.=—Karan, or Karna (_the radiant_),\r\nsucceeded to the last independent king of Mewar, S. 1677, A.D. 1621.\r\nHenceforth we shall have to exhibit these princely ‘children of the sun’\r\nwith diminished lustre, moving as satellites round the primary planet;\r\nbut, unaccustomed to the laws of its attraction, they soon deviated from\r\nthe orbit prescribed, and in the eccentricity of their movements\r\noccasionally displayed their unborrowed effulgence. For fifteen hundred\r\nyears we have traced each alternation of the fortune of this family,\r\nfrom their establishment in the second, to their expulsion in the fifth\r\ncentury from Saurashtra by the Parthians; the acquisition and loss of\r\nIdar; the conquest and surrender of Chitor; the rise of Udaipur and\r\nabasement of the red flag to Jahangir; and we shall conclude with not\r\nthe least striking portion of their history, their unity of interests\r\nwith Britain.\r\n\r\nKaran was deficient neither in courage nor conduct; of both he had given\r\na decided proof, when, to relieve the pecuniary difficulties of his\r\nfather, with a rapidity unparalleled, he passed through the midst of his\r\nfoes, surprised and plundered Surat, and carried off a booty which was\r\nthe means of protracting the evil days of his country. But for the\r\nexercise of the chief virtue of the Rajput, he [369] had little scope\r\nthroughout his reign, and fortunately for his country the powerful\r\nesteem and friendship which Jahangir and Prince Khurram evinced for his\r\nhouse, enabled him to put forth the talents he possessed to repair past\r\ndisasters. He fortified the heights round the capital, which he\r\nstrengthened with a wall and ditch, partly enlarged the noble dam which\r\nretains the waters of the Pichola, and built that entire portion of the\r\npalace called the Rawala, still set apart for the ladies of the court.\r\n\r\n=Terms between Rāna Karan Singh and Jahāngīr.=—When Rana Amra made terms\r\nwith Jahangir, he stipulated, as a salvo for his dignity and that of his\r\nsuccessors, exemption from all personal attendance; and confined the\r\nextent of homage to his successors receiving, on each lapse of the\r\ncrown, the farman or imperial decree in token of subordination, which,\r\nmore strongly to mark their dependent condition, the Rana was to accept\r\nwithout the walls of his capital; accordingly, though the heirs-apparent\r\nof Mewar[4.13.1] attended the court, they never did as Rana. Partly to\r\nlessen the weight of this sacrifice to independence, and partly to exalt\r\nthe higher grade of nobles, the princes of the blood-royal of Mewar were\r\nmade to rank below the Sixteen, a fictitious diminution of dignity\r\nwhich, with similar acts peculiar to this house, enhanced the\r\nself-estimation of the nobles, and made them brave every danger to\r\nobtain such sacrifices to the ruling passion of the Rajput, a love of\r\ndistinction.[4.13.2] It is mentioned by the emperor that he placed the\r\nheir-apparent of Mewar immediately on his right hand, over all the\r\nprinces of Hindustan; consequently the superior nobles of Mewar, who\r\nwere all men of royal descent, deemed themselves, and had their [370]\r\nclaims admitted, to rank above their peers at other courts, and to be\r\nseated almost on an equality with their princes.[4.13.3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RĀJMAHALL.\r\n  _To face page 428._\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Sesodias in the Imperial Service.=—The Sesodia chieftains were soon\r\ndistinguished amongst the Rajput vassals of the Mogul, and had a full\r\nshare of power. Of these Bhim, the younger brother of Karan, who headed\r\nthe quota of Mewar, was conspicuous, and became the chief adviser and\r\nfriend of Sultan Khurram, who well knew his intrepidity. At his son’s\r\nsolicitation, the emperor conferred upon him the title of Raja, and\r\nassigned a small principality on the Banas for his residence, of which\r\nToda was the capital. Ambitious of perpetuating a name, he erected a new\r\ncity and palace on the banks of the river, which he called Rajmahall,\r\nand which his descendants held till about forty years ago. The ruins of\r\nRajmahall[4.13.4] bear testimony to the architectural taste of this son\r\nof Mewar, as do the fallen fortunes of his descendant to the instability\r\nof power: the lineal heir of Raja Bhim serves the chief of Shahpura on\r\nhalf a crown a day!\r\n\r\n=Revolt and Death of Bhīm Singh.=—Jahangir, notwithstanding his favours,\r\nsoon had a specimen of the insubordinate spirit of Bhim. Being desirous\r\nto separate him from Sultan Khurram, who aspired to the crown in\r\nprejudice to his elder brother Parvez, he appointed Bhim to the\r\ngovernment of Gujarat, which was distinctly refused. Detesting Parvez,\r\nwho, it will be recollected, invaded Mewar, and was foiled for his\r\ncruelty on this occasion, Bhim advised his friend at once to throw off\r\nthe mask, if he aspired to reign. Parvez was slain,[4.13.5] and Khurram\r\nmanifested his guilt by flying to arms [371]. He was secretly supported\r\nby a strong party of the Rajput interest, at the head of which was Gaj\r\nSingh of Marwar, his maternal grandfather, who cautiously desired to\r\nremain neutral. Jahangir advanced to crush the incipient revolt; but\r\ndubious of the Rathor (Gaj Singh), he gave the van to Jaipur, upon which\r\nthe prince furled his banners and determined to be a spectator. The\r\narmies approached and were joining action, when the impetuous Bhim sent\r\na message to the Rathor either to aid or oppose them. The insult\r\nprovoked him to the latter course, and Bhim’s party was destroyed,\r\nhimself slain,[4.13.6] and Khurram and Mahabat Khan compelled to seek\r\nrefuge in Udaipur. In this asylum he remained undisturbed: apartments in\r\nthe palace were assigned to him; but his followers little respecting\r\nRajput prejudices, the island became his residence, on which a sumptuous\r\nedifice was raised, adorned with a lofty dome crowned with the crescent.\r\nThe interior was decorated with mosaic, in onyx, cornelian, jaspers, and\r\nagates, rich Turkey carpets, etc.; and that nothing of state might be\r\nwanting to the royal refugee, a throne was sculptured from a single\r\nblock of serpentine, supported by quadriform female Caryatidae. In the\r\ncourt a little chapel was erected to the Muhammadan saint Madar,[4.13.7]\r\nand here the prince with his court resided, every wish anticipated, till\r\na short time before his father’s death, when he retired into\r\nPersia.[4.13.8]\r\n\r\nSuch was Rajput gratitude to a prince who, when the chances of war made\r\nhim victor over them, had sought unceasingly to mitigate the misery\r\nattendant on the loss of independence! It is pleasing to record to the\r\nhonour of this calumniated race, that these feelings on the part of\r\nKaran were not transient; and that so far from expiring with the object,\r\n\r\n                 The debt immense of endless gratitude.\r\n\r\nwas transmitted as an heirloom to his issue; and though two centuries\r\nhave fled, during which Mewar had suffered every variety of woe,\r\npillaged by Mogul [372], Pathan, and Mahratta, yet the turban of Prince\r\nKhurram, the symbol of fraternity,[4.13.9] has been preserved, and\r\nremains in the same folds as when transferred from the head of the Mogul\r\nto that of the Rajput prince. The shield is yet held as the most sacred\r\nof relics, nor will the lamp which illumines the chapel of Madar want\r\noil while the princes of Udaipur have wherewithal to supply it.[4.13.10]\r\n\r\n=Death of Rāna Karan Singh.=—Rana Karan had enjoyed eight years of\r\nperfect tranquillity when he was gathered to his fathers. The sanctuary\r\nhe gave Prince Khurram had no apparent effect on Jahangir, who doubtless\r\nbelieved that the Rana did not sanction the conduct of his brother Bhim.\r\nHe was succeeded by his son Jagat Singh, ‘the lion of the world,’ in S.\r\n1684 (A.D. 1628).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JAGMANDIR PALACE, UDAIPUR.\r\n  _To face page 432._\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Rāna Jagat Singh I., A.D. 1628-52.=—The Emperor Jahangir died shortly\r\nafter his accession [October 28, 1627], and while Khurram was in exile.\r\nThis event, which gave the throne to the friend of his house, was\r\nannounced to him by the Rana, who sent his brother and a band of Rajputs\r\nto Surat to form the cortege of the emperor, who repaired directly to\r\nUdaipur; and it was in the Badal Mahall (‘the cloud saloon’) of his\r\npalace that he was first saluted by the title of ‘Shah Jahan,’ by the\r\nsatraps and tributary princes of the empire.[4.13.11] On taking leave,\r\nthe new monarch restored five alienated districts, and presented the\r\nRana with a ruby of inestimable value, giving him also permission to\r\nreconstruct the fortifications of Chitor.[4.13.12]\r\n\r\nThe twenty-six years during which Jagat Singh occupied the throne passed\r\nin uninterrupted tranquillity: a state unfruitful to the bard, who\r\nflourishes only amidst agitation and strife. This period was devoted to\r\nthe cultivation of the peaceful arts, especially architecture; and to\r\nJagat Singh Udaipur is indebted for those magnificent works which bear\r\nhis name, and excite our astonishment, after all the disasters we have\r\nrelated, at the resources he found to accomplish them [373].\r\n\r\n=Erection of Buildings at Udaipur.=—The palace on the lake (covering\r\nabout four acres), called the Jagniwas, is entirely his work, as well as\r\nmany additions to its sister isle, on which is the Jagmandir.[4.13.13]\r\nNothing but marble enters into their composition; columns, baths,\r\nreservoirs, fountains, all are of this material, often inlaid with\r\nmosaics, and the uniformity pleasingly diversified by the light passing\r\nthrough glass of every hue. The apartments are decorated with historical\r\npaintings in water-colours, almost meriting the term fresco from their\r\ndeep absorption in the wall, though the darker tints have blended with\r\nand in part obscured the more delicate shades, from atmospheric causes.\r\nThe walls, both here and in the grand palace, contain many medallions,\r\nin considerable relief, in gypsum, portraying the principal historical\r\nevents of the family, from early periods even to the marriage pomp of\r\nthe present Rana. Parterres of flowers, orange and lemon groves,\r\nintervene to dispel the monotony of the buildings, shaded by the\r\nwide-spreading tamarind and magnificent evergreen khirni;[4.13.14] while\r\nthe graceful palmyra and coco wave their plumelike branches over the\r\ndark cypress or cooling plantain. Detached colonnaded refectories are\r\nplaced on the water’s edge for the chiefs, and extensive baths for their\r\nuse. Here they listened to the tale of the bard, and slept off their\r\nnoonday opiate amidst the cool breezes of the lake, wafting delicious\r\nodours from myriads of the lotus-flower which covered the surface of the\r\nwaters; and as the fumes of the potion evaporated, they opened their\r\neyes on a landscape to which not even its inspirations could frame an\r\nequal: the broad waters of the Pichola, with its indented and\r\nwell-wooded margin receding to the terminating point of sight, at which\r\nthe temple of Brahmpuri opened on the pass of the gigantic Aravalli, the\r\nfield of the exploits of their forefathers. Amid such scenes did the\r\nSesodia princes and chieftains recreate during two generations,\r\nexchanging the din of arms for voluptuous inactivity.\r\n\r\nJagat Singh was a highly respected prince, and did much to efface the\r\nremembrance of the rude visitations of the Moguls. The dignity of his\r\ncharacter, his benevolence of address and personal demeanour, secured\r\nthe homage of all who had access to him, and are alike attested by the\r\npen of the emperor, the ambassador of England, and the chronicles of\r\nMewar. He had the proud satisfaction [374] of redeeming the ancient\r\ncapital from ruin; rebuilding the “chaplet bastion,[4.13.15] restoring\r\nthe portals, and replacing the pinnacles on the temples of Chitrakot.”\r\nBy a princess of Marwar he left two sons, the eldest of whom succeeded.\r\n\r\n=Rāna Rāj Singh, A.D. 1652-80.=—Raj Singh (the royal lion) mounted the\r\nthrone in S. 1710 (A.D. 1654). Various causes over which he had no\r\ncontrol combined, together with his personal character, to break the\r\nlong repose his country had enjoyed. The emperor of the Moguls had\r\nreached extreme old age, and the ambition of his sons to usurp his\r\nauthority involved every Rajput in support of their individual\r\npretensions. The Rana inclined to Dara,[4.13.16] the legitimate heir to\r\nthe throne, as did nearly the whole Rajput race; but the battle of\r\nFatehabad[4.13.17] silenced every pretension, and gave the lead to\r\nAurangzeb, which he maintained by the sacrifice of whatever opposed his\r\nambition. His father, brothers, nay, his own offspring, were in turn\r\nvictims to that thirst for power which eventually destroyed the monarchy\r\nof the Moguls.\r\n\r\nThe policy introduced by their founder, from which Akbar, Jahangir, and\r\nShah Jahan had reaped so many benefits, was unwisely abandoned by the\r\nlatter, who of all had the most powerful reasons for maintaining those\r\nties which connected the Rajput princes with his house. Historians have\r\nneglected to notice the great moral strength derived from this unity of\r\nthe indigenous races with their conquerors; for during no similar period\r\nwas the empire so secure, nor the Hindu race so cherished, as during the\r\nreigns of Jahangir and Shah Jahan: the former born from a Rajput\r\nprincess of Amber, and the latter from the house of Marwar. Aurangzeb’s\r\nunmixed Tatar blood brought no Rajput sympathies to his aid; on the\r\ncontrary, every noble family shed their best blood in withstanding his\r\naccession, and in the defence of Shah Jahan’s rights, while there was a\r\nhope of success. The politic Aurangzeb was not blind to this defect, and\r\nhe tried to remedy it in his successor; for both his declared heir, Shah\r\nAlam, and Azam, as well as his favourite grandson,[4.13.18] were the\r\noffspring of Rajputnis; but, uninfluenced himself by such predilections,\r\nhis bigotry outweighed his policy, and he visited the Rajputs with an\r\nunrelenting and unwise persecution [375].\r\n\r\nWe shall pass the twice-told tale of the struggle for power which ended\r\nin the destruction of the brothers, competitors with Aurangzeb: this\r\nbelongs to general history, not to the annals of Mewar; and that history\r\nis in every hand,[4.13.19] in which the magnanimity of Dara,[4.13.20]\r\nthe impetuosity of Murad, and the activity of Suja met the same tragical\r\nend.\r\n\r\n=Princes contemporary with Aurangzeb.=—It has seldom occurred that so\r\nmany distinguished princes were contemporary as during the reign of\r\nAurangzeb. Every Rajput principality had a head above mediocrity in\r\nconduct as in courage. Jai Singh of Amber, surnamed ‘the Mirza Raja’;\r\nJaswant Singh of Marwar, with the Haras of Bundi and Kotah; the Rathors\r\nof Bikaner, and Bundelas of Orchha and Datia, were men whose prejudices,\r\nproperly consulted, would have rendered the Mogul power indissoluble:\r\nbut he had but one measure of contumely for all, which inspired Sivaji\r\nwith designs of freedom to Maharashtra, and withdrew every sentiment of\r\nsupport from the princes of Rajasthan. In subtlety and the most specious\r\nhypocrisy, in that concentration of resolve which confides its deep\r\npurpose to none, in every qualification of the warrior or\r\nscholar,[4.13.21] Aurangzeb had no superior amongst the many\r\ndistinguished [376] of his race; but that sin by which ‘angels fell’ had\r\nsteeped him in an ocean of guilt, and not only neutralized his natural\r\ncapacities, but converted the means for unlimited power into an engine\r\nof self-destruction. “This hypocrisy,” says the eloquent Orme,[4.13.22]\r\n“encreased with his power, and in order to palliate to his Mahomedan\r\nsubjects the crimes by which he had become their sovereign, he\r\ndetermined to enforce the conversion of the Hindoos by the severest\r\npenalties, and even threatned the sword; as if the blood of his subjects\r\nwere to wash away the stains, with which he was imbrued by the blood of\r\nhis family.... Labour left the field and industry the loom, until the\r\ndecrease of the revenues drew representations from the governors of the\r\nprovinces; which induced Aurungzebe to substitute a capitation\r\ntax[4.13.23] as the ballance of the account between the two religions.”\r\nThe same historian justly characterizes this enactment as one so\r\ncontrary to all notions of sound policy, as well as of the feelings of\r\nhumanity, that “reflection seeks the motive with amazement.” In this\r\namazement we might remain, nor seek to develop the motive, did not the\r\nample page of history in all [377] nations disclose that in the name of\r\nreligion more blood has been shed, and more atrocity committed, than by\r\nthe united action of the whole catalogue of the passions. Muhammad’s\r\ncreed was based on conversion, which, by whatever means effected, was a\r\nplenary atonement for every crime. In obedience thereto Aurangzeb acted;\r\nbut though myriads of victims who clung to their faith were sacrificed\r\nby him at the fiat of this gladiatorial prophet, yet nor these, nor the\r\nscrupulous fulfilment of fanatic observances, could soothe at the dread\r\nhour the perturbations of the ‘still small voice’ which whispered the\r\nnames of father, brother, son, bereft by him of life. Eloquently does he\r\nportray these terrors in his letters to his grandson on his death-bed,\r\nwherein he says, \"Whichever way I look, I see only the divinity\"—and\r\nthat an offended divinity [378].[4.13.24]\r\n\r\n=Rāna Rāj Singh defies Aurangzeb.=—Raj Singh had signalized his\r\naccession by the revival of the warlike Tika-daur, and plundered\r\nMalpura, which though on the Ajmer frontier, Shah Jahan, when advised to\r\nvengeance, replied “it was only a folly of his nephew.”[4.13.25] An\r\nappeal to his gallantry made him throw down the gauntlet to Aurangzeb in\r\nthe plenitude of his power, when the valour of the Sesodias again burst\r\nforth in all the splendour of the days of Partap; nor did the contest\r\nclose till after a series of brilliant victories, and with the narrow\r\nescape from captivity of the Xerxes of Hindustan. The Mogul demanded the\r\nhand of the princess of Rupnagar, a junior branch of the Marwar house,\r\nand sent with the demand (a compliance with which was contemplated as\r\ncertain) a cortège of two thousand horse to escort the fair to court.\r\nBut the haughty Rajputni, either indignant at such precipitation or\r\ncharmed with the gallantry of the Rana, who had evinced his devotion to\r\nthe fair by measuring his sword with the head of her house, rejected\r\nwith disdain the proffered alliance, and, justified by brilliant\r\nprecedents in the romantic history of her nation, she entrusted her\r\ncause to the arm of the chief of the Rajput race, offering herself as\r\nthe reward of protection. The family priest (her preceptor) deemed his\r\noffice honoured by being the messenger of her wishes, and the billet he\r\nconveyed is incorporated in the memorial of this reign. “Is the swan to\r\nbe the mate of the stork: a Rajputni, pure in blood, to be wife to the\r\nmonkey-faced barbarian!” concluding with a threat of self-destruction if\r\nnot saved from dishonour. This appeal, with other powerful motives, was\r\nseized on with avidity by the Rana as a pretext to throw away the\r\nscabbard, in order to illustrate the opening of a warfare, in which he\r\ndetermined to put all to the hazard in defence of his country and his\r\nfaith. The issue was an omen of success to his warlike and [379]\r\nsuperstitious vassalage. With a chosen band he rapidly passed the foot\r\nof the Aravalli and appeared before Rupnagar, cut up the imperial\r\nguards, and bore off the prize to his capital. The daring act was\r\napplauded by all who bore the name of Rajput, and his chiefs with joy\r\ngathered their retainers around the ‘red standard,’ to protect the queen\r\nso gallantly achieved.\r\n\r\n=The Imposition of the Jizya or Capitation Tax.=—The annalist of\r\nRajputana is but an indifferent chronologist, and leaves us doubtful of\r\nthe exact succession of events at this period. It was not, however, till\r\nthe death of those two powerful princes, Jaswant Singh of Marwar and Jai\r\nSingh of Amber, both poisoned by command of the tyrant, the one at his\r\ndistant government of Kabul, the other in the Deccan, that he deemed\r\nhimself free to put forth the full extent of his long-concealed design,\r\nthe imposition of the _jizya_ or capitation tax on the whole Hindu race.\r\nBut he miscalculated his measures, and the murder of these princes, far\r\nfrom advancing his aim, recoiled with vengeance on his head. Foiled in\r\nhis plot to entrap the infant sons of the Rathor by the self-devotion of\r\nhis vassals,[4.13.26] the compound treachery evinced that their only\r\nhope lay in a deadly resistance. The mother of Ajit, the infant heir of\r\nMarwar, a woman of the most determined character, was a princess of\r\nMewar, and she threw herself upon the Rana as the natural guardian of\r\nhis rights, for sanctuary (_saran_) during the dangers of his minority.\r\nThis was readily yielded, and Kelwa assigned as his residence, where\r\nunder the immediate safeguard of the brave Durgadas Ajit\r\nresided,[4.13.27] while she nursed the spirit of resistance at home. A\r\nunion of interests was cemented between these the chief States of\r\nRajputana, for which they never before had such motive, and but for\r\nrepeated instances of an ill-judged humanity, the throne of the Moguls\r\nmight have been completely overturned [380].\r\n\r\n=Letter of Remonstrance to Aurangzeb.=—On the promulgation of that\r\nbarbarous edict, the _jizya_, the Rana remonstrated by letter, in the\r\nname of the nation of which he was the head, in a style of such\r\nuncompromising dignity, such lofty yet temperate resolve, so much of\r\nsoul-stirring rebuke mingled with a boundless and tolerating\r\nbenevolence, such elevated ideas of the Divinity with such pure\r\nphilanthropy, that it may challenge competition with any epistolary\r\nproduction of any age, clime, or condition.[4.13.28] In this are\r\ncontained the true principles of Christianity, and to the illustrious\r\nGentile, and such as acted as he did, was pointed that golden sentence\r\nof toleration, \"Those [381] who have not the law, yet do by nature the\r\nthings contained in the law, shall be a law unto themselves.\"\r\n\r\n=Aurangzeb attacks Mewār.=—This letter, the sanctuary afforded Ajit,\r\nand (what the historical parasite of the Mogul’s life dared not\r\nindite[4.13.29]) the carrying off of his betrothed, made him pour out\r\nall the phials of his wrath against the devoted Mewar, and his\r\npreparations more resembled those for the conquest of a potent kingdom\r\nthan the subjugation of a Rajput _zamindar,_[4.13.30] a vassal of that\r\ncolossal empire on whose surface his domain was but a speck. In the\r\nvery magnitude of these, the Suzerain of Hindustan paid the highest\r\ntribute of praise to the tributary Rajput, for he denuded the very\r\nextremities of his empire to assemble a host which he deemed must\r\nprove irresistible. Akbar was recalled from his province, Bengal; Azam\r\nfrom the distant Kabul; and even Muazzam (the Mogul’s heir) from the\r\nwar in the Deccan. With this formidable array[4.13.31] the emperor\r\nentered Mewar, and soon reduced the low countries, which experience\r\nhad taught them were indefensible, the inhabitants previously retiring\r\nwith their effects to the hills.[4.13.32] Chitor, Mandalgarh,\r\nMandasor, Jiran, and many other strongholds were obtained after the\r\nusual form of opposition, and garrisoned by the Moguls. Meanwhile the\r\nRana was animating the might of the Aravalli, where he meditated a\r\nresistance proportioned to the peril which threatened every cherished\r\nprejudice of his race: not the mere defence of dominion or dignity,\r\nbut a struggle, _pro aris et focis_, around which rallied every Rajput\r\nwith the most deadly determination. Even the primitive races of the\r\nwestern wilds, “the Palindas[4.13.33] and Palipats[4.13.33] (_lord of\r\nthe passes_), with thousands of bows, and hearts devoted in the cause\r\nof Hindupat,”[4.13.34] assembled round the red banner of Mewar. The\r\nRana divided his forces into three bodies [382]. His eldest son, Jai\r\nSingh, was posted on the crest of the Aravalli, ready to act on the\r\ninvaders from either side of the mountains. Prince Bhim was to the\r\nwest, to keep up the communications with the outlets to Gujarat; while\r\nthe Rana, with the main body, took post in the Nai defile,\r\nunassailable by the enemy, and hanging on his left flank, ready to\r\nturn it, and cut off all retreat the moment the Imperialists entered\r\nthe mountains. Aurangzeb advanced to Debari, but instead of entering\r\nthe valley of which it was the gorge, he halted, and by the advice of\r\nTahawwar Khan[4.13.35] sent on Prince Akbar with fifty thousand men to\r\nthe capital. This caution of the wily monarch saved him from the ably\r\nplanned scheme of the Rajput prince, who evinced a thorough\r\nknowledge[4.13.36] of the topography of this intricate and romantic\r\nportion of his domain. The Girwa, emphatically ‘the Circle,’ from\r\nwhich the valley of the capital is named, has this form to the eye\r\nwhen viewing it from thence as a centre. It is, however, an irregular\r\nellipse of about fourteen miles in length from south to north, and\r\nabout eleven in breadth from east to west, the capital being situated\r\ntowards the extremity of the transverse axis, having only the lake\r\nPichola between it and the base of the Aravalli. The mountains of this\r\ncircular (_girwa_) valley, ranging from eight to twelve hundred feet\r\nin height, are of primitive formation, and raise their fantastic\r\npinnacles in every diversity of shape over each other. To the westward\r\nthe grand chain rises two thousand feet above the plains, and might be\r\ntermed the chord, of which the Girwa is an irregular segment of a\r\ncircle, less in height, and far less compound in character. Towards\r\nthe plains east, it has three practicable passes; one, the more\r\nnorthern, by Delwara; the other (central), by Debari; a third, leading\r\nto the intricacies of Chappan, that of Nai. Of these three passes the\r\nemperor chose the most practicable, and encamped near the Udaisagar\r\nlake, on the left of its entrance.\r\n\r\n=The Advance of Prince Akbar.=—Prince Akbar advanced. “Not a soul\r\ninterrupted his progress to the city. Palaces, gardens, lakes, and isles\r\nmet his eye, but no living thing: all was silence.” Akbar encamped.\r\nAccustomed to this desertion from the desire of the people to avoid a\r\nlicentious soldiery, and lulled into a hardy security, he was surprised\r\n[383] by the heir of Mewar. Some were praying, some feasting, some at\r\nchess: “they came to steal and yet fell asleep,” says the annalist, and\r\nwere dispersed with terrific and unrelenting slaughter. Cut off from the\r\npossibility of a junction with the emperor by a movement of a part of\r\nthe Rana’s personal force, Akbar attempted a retreat to the plains of\r\nMarwar by the route of Gogunda. It was a choice of evils, and he took\r\nthe worst. The allodial vassals of the mountains, with the Bhil\r\nauxiliaries, outstripped his retreat, and blocked up farther egress in\r\none of those long-extended valleys termed _Nal_, closed by a natural\r\nrampart or _Col_, on which they formed _abbatis_ of trees, and manning\r\nthe crests on each side, hurled destruction on the foe; while the\r\nprince, in like manner, blocked up the entrance and barred\r\nretrogression. Death menaced them in every form. For several days they\r\nhad only the prospect of surrender to save them from famine and a justly\r\nincensed foe, when an ill-judged humanity on the part of Jai Singh saved\r\nthem from annihilation. He admitted overtures, confided in protestations\r\nto renounce the origin of the war, and gave them guides to conduct them\r\nby the defile of Jhilwara, nor did they halt till protected by the walls\r\nof Chitor.[4.13.37]\r\n\r\nAnother body of the Imperialists, under the celebrated Dilir\r\nKhan,[4.13.38] who [384] entered by the Desuri Pass from Marwar\r\n(probably with a view of extricating Prince Akbar), were allowed to\r\nadvance unopposed, and when in the long intricate gorge were assailed by\r\nBikram Solanki[4.13.39] and Gopinath Rathor[4.13.40] (both nobles of\r\nMewar), and after a desperate conflict entirely destroyed. On each\r\noccasion a vast booty fell into the hands of the Rajputs.\r\n\r\nSo ably concerted was this mountain warfare, that these defeats were the\r\nsignal for a simultaneous attack by the Rana on Aurangzeb, who, with his\r\nson Azam, watched at Debari the result of the operations under Akbar and\r\nDilir. The great home-clans had more than their wonted rivalry to\r\nsustain them, for the gallant Durgadas with the Rathor swords (_talwār\r\nRāthorān_) whetted by an accumulation of wrongs, were to combat with\r\nthem against their common oppressor; and nobly did they contest the palm\r\nof glory. The tyrant could not withstand them: his guns, though manned\r\nby Franks, could not protect him against the just cause and avenging\r\nsteel of the Rajput, and he was beaten and compelled to disgraceful\r\nflight, with an immense loss in men and equipment. The Rana had to\r\nlament many brave leaders, home and auxiliary; and the imperial\r\nstandard, elephants, and state equipage fell into his hands, the\r\nacquisition of Mohkam and the Saktawats. This glorious encounter\r\noccurred in the spring month of Phalgun, S. 1737, March A.D. 1681\r\n[1680].\r\n\r\nThe discomfited forces formed a junction under the walls of Chitor,\r\nwhence the emperor dictated the recall of his son, Prince Muazzam,\r\nfrom the Deccan, deeming it of greater moment to regain lost\r\nimportance in the north than to prevent the independence of Sivaji.\r\nMeanwhile the activity of Sawaldas (descended from the illustrious\r\nJaimall) cut off the communication between Chitor and Ajmer, and\r\nalarmed the tyrant for his personal safety. Leaving, therefore, this\r\nperilous warfare to his sons Azam and Akbar, with instructions how to\r\nact till reinforced,—foiled in his vengeance and personally disgraced,\r\nhe abandoned Mewar, and at the head of his guards repaired to Ajmer.\r\nThence he detached[4.13.41] Khan Rohilla, with twelve thousand men,\r\nagainst Sawaldas, with supplies and equipments for his sons. The\r\nRathor, joined by the troops of Marwar, gave him the meeting at Pur\r\nMandal, and defeated the Imperialists with great loss, driving them\r\nback on Ajmer [385].\r\n\r\n=Diversion made by the Rājputs.=—While the Rana, his heir and\r\nauxiliaries, were thus triumphant in all their operations, Prince Bhim\r\nwith the left division was not idle, but made a powerful diversion by\r\nthe invasion of Gujarat, captured Idar, expelling Hasan and his\r\ngarrison, and proceeding by Birnagar, suddenly appeared before Patan,\r\nthe residence of the provincial satrap, which he plundered. Siddhpur,\r\nModasa,[4.13.42] and other towns shared the same fate; and he was in\r\nfull march to Surat, when the benevolence of the Rana, touched at the\r\nwoes of the fugitives, who came to demand his forbearance, caused him to\r\nrecall Bhim in the midst of his career.\r\n\r\nContrary to the Rajput character, whose maxim is _parcere subjectis_,\r\nthey were compelled by the utter faithlessness of Aurangzeb (chiefly\r\nvulnerable through his resources) to retaliate his excesses; and Dayal\r\nSah, the civil minister, a man of high courage and activity, headed\r\nanother flying force, which ravaged Malwa to the Nerbudda and Betwa.\r\nSarangpur, Dewas, Sironj, Mandu, Ujjain, and Chanderi were plundered,\r\nand numerous garrisons put to the sword; and, to use the words of the\r\nChronicle, “husbands abandoned their wives and children, and whatever\r\ncould not be carried off was given to the flames.” For once they avenged\r\nthemselves, in imitation of the tyrant, even on the religion of their\r\nenemies: “the Kazis were bound and shaved, and the Korans thrown into\r\nwells.” The minister was unrelenting and made Malwa a desert, and from\r\nthe fruits of his incursions repaired the resources of his master.\r\nFlushed with success, he formed a junction with the heir of Mewar, and\r\ngave battle to Azam near Chitor. On this occasion the flower of Mewar,\r\nwith the Rathor and Khichi auxiliaries,[4.13.43] were engaged, and\r\nobtained a glorious victory, the Mogul prince being defeated and pursued\r\nwith great slaughter to Ranthambhor, which he entered. This was a just\r\nrevenge, for it was Azam who surprised Chitor the year preceding. In\r\nMewar the contest terminated with the expulsion of the Imperialists from\r\nthe country; when the Rana, in support of the rights of the minor prince\r\nof Marwar, united his arms to the forces of that state, and opened the\r\ncampaign at Ghanerao, the chief town of [386] Godwar. The heroic mother\r\nof the infant Rathor prince, a daughter of Mewar, had, since the death\r\nof her husband, well supported his rights, having resisted every\r\naggression and regained many lost advantages over their antagonist.\r\nPrince Bhim commanded the Sesodias, who formed a junction with the\r\nRathors, and gave battle to the royal forces led by Akbar and Tahawwar\r\nKhan, whom they entirely defeated. The victory is chiefly attributed to\r\na stratagem of a Rajput chief, who, having carried off five hundred\r\ncamels from the Imperialists, conceived the idea of fixing torches to\r\nthem and letting them loose in the royal camp; and, in the confusion\r\nproduced by the charge of such a body, the Rajputs assaulted them.\r\n\r\n=Plan to dethrone Aurangzeb.=—On their continued successes, the Rana and\r\nhis allies meditated the project of dethroning the tyrant and setting up\r\nhis son Akbar. The pernicious example of his father towards Shah Jahan\r\nwas not lost upon Akbar, who favourably received the overture; but he\r\nwanted the circumspection which characterized Aurangzeb, whose\r\npenetration defeated the scheme when on the eve of execution.[4.13.44]\r\nAlready had the Rajput armies united with Akbar, and the astrologer had\r\nfixed the day which was to exalt him; but the revealer of secrets\r\nbaffled his own prediction by disclosing it to the emperor. Aurangzeb,\r\nattended only by his guards at Ajmer, had recourse to the same artifice\r\nwhich raised him to empire, in order to ward off this danger. Akbar was\r\nbut one day’s march distant; his elder sons, Muazzam and Azam, yet far\r\noff. Not a moment was to be lost: he penned a letter to his son, which\r\nby a spy was dropped in the tent of the Rajput leader Durgadas.[4.13.45]\r\nIn this he applauded a pretended scheme by which Akbar was to fall upon\r\nthem when they engaged the emperor. The same scheme had saved Sher Shah\r\nin this country from Maldeo, and has more recently been put in practice,\r\nand with like success, in the war with Sivaji. It succeeded. The Rajputs\r\ndetached themselves from the prince who had apparently betrayed them.\r\nTahawwar Khan, in despair, lost his life in an attempt to assassinate\r\nthe emperor,[4.13.46] and before the artifice was discovered, the\r\nreinforcements under Muazzam and Azam arrived, and Aurangzeb was saved.\r\nThe Rajputs still offered _saran_ (refuge) to Akbar; but aware of his\r\nfather’s vigour of character, he deemed himself unsafe in his vicinage,\r\nand accepted the escort of five hundred Rajputs led by Durgadas [387],\r\nwho cut their way through every opposition by the defiles of Mewar and\r\nDungarpur, and across the Nerbudda, to the Mahratta leader Sambhaji, at\r\nPalargarh, whence he was shortly after conveyed in an English ship to\r\nPersia.[4.13.47]\r\n\r\n=Overtures for Peace.=—“The escape of Acbar” (observes an\r\nhistorian,[4.13.48] who appreciated the importance of the transactions\r\nof this period) “to Sambagee, oppressed Aurengzebe with as much anxiety,\r\nas formerly the phantom of his brother Sujah amongst the Pitans; and the\r\nconsequence of their alliance became a nearer care than the continuance\r\nof the war against the Rajpoots, whose gallant activity prevented a\r\nspeedy decision by the sword; but the dignity of the throne forbad any\r\novertures of peace to a resistance which had attempted the deposal, if\r\nnot the life, of the monarch. A Rajpoot officer, who had long served\r\nwith distinction under Delire Khan, solved the difficulty: he quitted\r\nthe army on the pretence of retiring to his own country and visited the\r\nRana as from courtesy on his journey. The conversation turned on the\r\nwar, which the Rajpoot perhaps really lamented, and he persuaded the\r\nRana that although Aurengzebe would never condescend to make, he might\r\naccept overtures of peace: upon which he was empowered by the Rana to\r\ntender them.”[4.13.49] The domestic annals confirm this account, and\r\ngive the name of this mediator, Raja Shyam Singh of Bikaner; but the\r\nnegotiation was infamously protracted to the rains, the period when\r\noperations necessarily cease, and by which time Aurangzeb had recruited\r\nhis broken forces, and was again enabled to take the field; and it was\r\nconcluded “without assertion or release of the capitation tax, but with\r\nthe surrender of the districts taken from Chitor, and the State of\r\nJodhpur was included in the treaty.” How correctly this elegant\r\nhistorian had obtained a knowledge of those events, a translation of the\r\ntreaty evinces.[4.13.50] But these occurrences belong to the succeeding\r\nreign, for the Rana died about this period,[4.13.51] from wounds and\r\nvexation.\r\n\r\n=Cruel Treatment of Rāja of Golkonda.=—Once more we claim the reader’s\r\nadmiration on behalf of another patriot prince of Mewar, and ask him to\r\ncontrast the indigenous Rajput with the emperor of the Moguls [388];\r\nthough to compare them would be manifestly unjust, since in every moral\r\nvirtue they were antipodes to each other. Aurangzeb accumulated on his\r\nhead more crimes than any prince who ever sat on an Asiatic throne. With\r\nall the disregard of life which marks his nation, he was never betrayed,\r\neven in the fever of success, into a single generous action; and,\r\ncontrary to the prevailing principle of our nature, the moment of his\r\nfoe’s submission was that chosen for the malignant completion of his\r\nrevenge: witness his scourging the prostrate King of Golkonda.[4.13.52]\r\nHow opposite to the beneficence of the Rajput prince, who, when the most\r\nefficient means of self-defence lay in the destruction of the resources\r\nof his enemy, feeling for the miseries of the suffering population of\r\nhis persecutor, recalled his son in the midst of victory! As a skilful\r\ngeneral and gallant soldier, in the defence of his country, he is above\r\nall [389] praise. As a chivalrous Rajput, his braving all consequences\r\nwhen called upon to save the honour of a noble female of his race, he is\r\nwithout parallel. As an accomplished prince and benevolent man, his\r\ndignified letter of remonstrance to Aurangzeb on the promulgation of the\r\ncapitation edict, places him high in the scale of moral as well as\r\nintellectual excellence; and an additional evidence of both, and of his\r\ntaste for the arts, is furnished by the formation of the inland lake,\r\nthe Rajsamund, with a slight account of which, and the motives for its\r\nexecution, we shall conclude the sketch of this glorious epoch in the\r\nannals of Mewar.\r\n\r\n=The Rājsamund Lake.=—This great national work is twenty-five miles\r\nnorth of the capital, and is situated on the declivity of the plain\r\nabout two miles from the base of the Aravalli. A small perennial stream,\r\ncalled the Gomati or ‘serpentine,’[4.13.53] flowing from these\r\nmountains, was arrested in its course, and confined by an immense\r\nembankment, made to form the lake called after himself, Rajsamund, or\r\n‘royal sea.’ The _band_ or dam forms an irregular segment of a circle,\r\nembracing an extent of nearly three miles, and encircling the waters on\r\nevery side except the space between the north-west and north-east\r\npoints. This barrier, which confines a sheet of water of great depth,\r\nand about twelve miles in circumference, is entirely of white marble,\r\nwith a flight of steps of the same material, throughout this extent,\r\nfrom the summit to the water’s edge; the whole buttressed by an enormous\r\nrampart of earth, which, had the projector lived, would have been\r\nplanted with trees to form a promenade. On the south side are the town\r\nand fortress built by the Rana, and bearing his name, Rajnagar; and upon\r\nthe embankment stands the temple of Kankroli, the shrine of one of the\r\nseven forms (_sarup_) of Krishna. The whole is ornamented with sculpture\r\nof tolerable execution for the age; and a genealogical sketch of the\r\nfounder’s family is inscribed in conspicuous characters. One million one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling,[4.13.54] contributed by the\r\nRana, his chiefs and opulent subjects, was expended on this work, of\r\nwhich the material was from the adjacent quarries. But, magnificent,\r\ncostly, and useful as it is, it derives its chief beauty from the\r\nbenevolent motive to which it owes its birth: to alleviate the miseries\r\nof a starving population, and make their employment conducive to\r\nnational benefit, during one of those awful visitations [390] of\r\nprovidence, famine, and pestilence with which these states are sometimes\r\nafflicted.\r\n\r\n=The Famine of A.D. 1662.=—It was in S. 1717,[4.13.55] only seven years\r\nafter the accession of Raj Singh, that these combined evils reached\r\nMewar, less subject to them, owing to its natural advantages, than any\r\nother State in India;[4.13.56] and on Tuesday the 8th of Pus, Hasti\r\nNakshatra (constellation of the elephant), as fixed by the astrologer,\r\nthe first stone was laid. \"The chief of Mewar, deeply meditating on this\r\nextreme distress, determined to raise a monument, by which the wretched\r\nmight be supported and his own name perpetuated. This was seven years in\r\nconstructing, and at its commencement and termination all the rites of\r\nsacrifice and oblation were observed.\r\n\r\n\"The Rana went to implore favour at the temple of the ‘four-armed’; for\r\nthough Asarh[4.13.57] was over, not a drop of rain fell from the\r\nheavens; and, in like manner, the months of Sawan[4.13.57] and\r\nBhadon[4.13.57] passed away. For want of water the world was in despair,\r\nand people went mad with hunger. Things unknown as food were eaten. The\r\nhusband abandoned the wife, the wife the husband—parents sold their\r\nchildren—time increased the evil; it spread far and wide: even the\r\ninsects died: they had nothing to feed on. Thousands of all ages became\r\nvictims to hunger. Those who procured food to-day, ate twice what nature\r\nrequired. The wind was from the west, a pestilential vapour. The\r\nconstellations were always visible at night, nor was there a cloud in\r\nthe sky by day, and thunder and lightning were unknown. Such portents\r\nfilled mankind with dread. Rivers, lakes, and fountains were dried up.\r\nMen of wealth meted out the portions of food. The ministers of religion\r\nforgot their duties. There was no longer distinction of caste, and the\r\nSudra and Brahman were undistinguishable. Strength, wisdom, caste,\r\ntribe, all were abandoned, and food alone was the object. The\r\nCharbaran[4.13.58] threw away every symbol of separation; all was lost\r\nin hunger. Fruits, flowers, every vegetable thing, even trees were\r\nstripped of their bark, to appease the cravings [391] of hunger: nay,\r\n_man ate man_! Cities were depopulated. The seed of families was lost,\r\nthe fishes were extinct, and the hope of all extinguished.\"[4.13.59]\r\n\r\nSuch is the simple yet terrific record of this pestilence, from which\r\nMewar was hardly freed, when Aurangzeb commenced the religious warfare\r\nnarrated, with all its atrocities, still further to devastate this fair\r\nregion. But a just retribution resulted from this disregard to the\r\ncharacter and prejudices of the Rajputs, which visited the emperor with\r\nshame, and his successors with the overthrow of their power.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.13.1:\r\n\r\n  The contingent of Mewar was one thousand horse.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.13.2:\r\n\r\n  During the progress of my mediation between the Rana and his nobles,\r\n  in 1818, the conduct of the lineal representative of Jaimall, the\r\n  defender of Chitor against Akbar, was striking. Instead of\r\n  surrendering the lands which he was accused of usurping, he placed\r\n  himself at the door of the threshold of the palace, whence he was\r\n  immovable. His claims were left to my adjudication: but he complained\r\n  with great heat of the omission of ceremonials, and especially of the\r\n  prostration of honours by the prince. I incautiously remarked that\r\n  these were trivial compared with the other objects in view, and begged\r\n  him to disregard it. “Disregard it! why, it was for these things my\r\n  ancestors sacrificed their lives; when such a band[4.13.2.A] as this\r\n  on my turban was deemed ample reward for the most distinguished\r\n  service, and made them laugh at wounds and hardships!” Abashed at the\r\n  inconsiderate remark which provoked this lofty reproof, I used my\r\n  influence to have the omission rectified: the lands were restored, and\r\n  the enthusiastic reverence with which I spoke of Jaimall would have\r\n  obtained even greater proof of the Badnor chief’s regard for the fame\r\n  of his ancestors than the surrender of them implied. Who would not\r\n  honour this attachment to such emblems in the days of adversity?\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.13.2.A:\r\n\r\n  _Balaband_, a fillet or band, sometimes embroidered; often, as in the\r\n  present case, of silk or gold thread knotted, and tassels tied round\r\n  the turban. _Balaband_ is synonymous with diadem.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.13.3:\r\n\r\n  This was conceded, as the following anecdote will attest. When the\r\n  first Peshwa [Bālaji Visvanāth (1707-20)] appeared at the Jaipur court\r\n  he was accompanied by the Salumbar chieftain. The Jaipur prince\r\n  divided his gaddi (_cushion_) with the Peshwa, and the latter made\r\n  room for the Salumbar chief upon it, observing that their privileges\r\n  and rank were similar. The same Peshwa had the address to avoid all\r\n  discussion of rank at Udaipur, by alleging the prerogative of his\r\n  order to ‘_spread his cloth in front of the throne_,’ a distinction to\r\n  which every priest is entitled.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.13.4:\r\n\r\n  The plate represents Rajmahall, on the Banas, now in the fief of Rao\r\n  Chand Singh, one of the Jaipur nobles, whose castle of Duni is in the\r\n  distance. There are many picturesque scenes of this nature on the\r\n  Banas. Duni made a celebrated defence against Sindhia’s army in 1808,\r\n  and held out several months, though the Mahratta prince had an army of\r\n  forty thousand men and a park of eighty pieces of cannon to oppose two\r\n  hundred Rajputs. They made sorties, captured his foragers, cut his\r\n  batteries to pieces, and carried off his guns (of which they had\r\n  none), and, placing them on their walls, with his own shot made the\r\n  whole army change position, beyond matchlock range. At last their\r\n  inexpertness rendered them useless, and they obtained honourable\r\n  terms. On one occasion the foragers of our escort were returning, and\r\n  met Sindhia’s coming away without their guns and cattle, which had\r\n  just been taken from them. Our lads, from fellowship, volunteered to\r\n  recover them, and returned on the captors, who gave them up (if my\r\n  memory deceive me not) without a struggle, and from respect to the red\r\n  coat!\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.13.5:\r\n\r\n  [Parvez died at Burhānpur, Nimār District, Central Provinces, in his\r\n  thirty-eighth year, on October 28, 1626.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.13.6:\r\n\r\n  Man Singh, chief of the Saktawats, and his brother Gokuldas, were\r\n  Bhim’s advisers, and formed with Mahabat Khan the junta who ruled the\r\n  Mogul heir-apparent. Man held Sanwar in the Khairar, and was\r\n  celebrated in Amra’s wars as the great champion of the Sesodias. He\r\n  counted above eighty wounds, and had at various times \"sent a _ser_\r\n  (two pounds) of exfoliated bone to the Ganges.\" Such was the affection\r\n  between Man and Bhim, that they concealed the death of the latter,\r\n  sending him food in Bhim’s name; but he no sooner learned the truth\r\n  than he tore away the bandages and expired. Of Gokuldas the bard says,\r\n  in allusion to the peaceful reign of Karan, “The wreath of Karan’s\r\n  renown was fading, but Gokul revived it with his blood.” It was with\r\n  the Sesodia Rajputs and the Saktawats that Mahabat performed the most\r\n  daring exploit in Mogul history, making Jahangir prisoner in his own\r\n  camp: but it is too long for insertion in a note. [This occurred in\r\n  1626; see Elphinstone, _Hist. of India_, 568.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.13.7:\r\n\r\n  [The saint Madār is said to have been a Jew from Aleppo who lived from\r\n  A.D. 1050 to 1433, and was buried at Makanpur in the Cawnpur District,\r\n  where pilgrims visit his tomb (_IGI_, xvii. 43; _Dabistan_, trans.\r\n  Shea-Troyer iii. 244 ff.).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.13.8:\r\n\r\n  Contemporary historians say to Golkonda.

Are these people worth\r\n  conciliating? or does the mist of ignorance and egotism so blind us\r\n  that we are to despise the minds hidden under the cloak of poverty and\r\n  long oppression? The orange-coloured turban, and the shield of Shah\r\n  Jahan, have been brought from their sacred niche for my view: that I\r\n  looked on them with sentiments of reverence, as relics consecrated by\r\n  the noblest feeling of the mind, will be credited.

Let me tell you,\r\n  if you had instructed me as you should have done, nothing would be\r\n  more just; for I am of this persuasion, that a child well educated and\r\n  instructed is as much, at least, obliged to his master as to his\r\n  father. But where are those good documents you have given me? In the\r\n  first place, you have taught me that all that Frangistan (so it seems\r\n  they call Europe) was nothing but I know not what little island, of\r\n  which the greatest king was he of Portugal, and next to him he of\r\n  Holland, and after him he of England: and as to the other kings, as\r\n  those of France and Andalusia, you have represented them to me as our\r\n  petty Rajas; telling me that the kings of Indostan were far above them\r\n  all together, and that they were the true and only Houmayons, the\r\n  Ekbars, the Jehan-Guyres, the Chah-Jehans, the fortunate ones, the\r\n  great ones, the conquerors and kings of the world; and that Persia and\r\n  Usbec, Kachguer, Tartar and Catay, Pegu, China and Matchina did\r\n  tremble at the name of the kings of Indostan. Admirable geography! You\r\n  should rather have taught me exactly to distinguish all those\r\n  different states of the world, and well to understand their strength,\r\n  their way of fighting, their customs, religions, governments, and\r\n  interests; and, by the perusal of solid history, to observe their\r\n  rise, progress, decay, and whence, how, and by what accidents and\r\n  errors those great changes and revolutions of empires and kingdoms\r\n  have happened. I have scarce learnt of you the name of my grandsires,\r\n  the famous founders of this empire: so far were you from having taught\r\n  me the history of their life, and what course they took to make such\r\n  great conquests. You had a mind to teach me the Arabian tongue, to\r\n  read and to write. I am much obliged to you, forsooth, for having made\r\n  me lose so much time upon a language that requires ten or twelve years\r\n  to attain to its perfection; as if the son of a king should think it\r\n  to be an honour to him to be a grammarian or some doctor of the law,\r\n  and to learn other languages than those of his neighbours, when he\r\n  cannot well be without them; he, to whom time is so precious for so\r\n  many weighty things, which he ought by times to learn. As if there\r\n  were any spirit that did not with some reluctancy, and even with a\r\n  kind of debasement, employ itself in so sad and dry an exercise, so\r\n  longsom and tedious, as is that of learning words.’\r\n\r\n  \"Thus did Arung-Zebe resent the pedantic instructions of his tutor; to\r\n  which ’tis affirmed in that court, that after some entertainment which\r\n  he had with others, he further added the following reproof:\r\n\r\n  \"‘Know you not, that childhood well govern’d, being a state which is\r\n  ordinarily accompanied with an happy memory, is capable of thousands\r\n  of good precepts and instructions, which remain deeply impressed the\r\n  whole remainder of a man’s life, and keep the mind always raised for\r\n  great actions? The law, prayers, and science, may they not as well be\r\n  learned in our mother-tongue as in Arabick? You told my father, Chah\r\n  Jehan, that you would teach me philosophy. ’Tis true, I remember very\r\n  well, that you have entertain’d me for many years with airy questions\r\n  of things that afford no satisfaction at all to the mind, and are of\r\n  no use in humane society, empty notions and mere phancies, that have\r\n  only this in them, that they are very hard to understand and very\r\n  easie to forget, which are only capable to tire and spoil a good\r\n  understanding, and to breed an opinion that is insupportable. I still\r\n  remember, that after you had thus amused me, I know not how long, with\r\n  your fine philosophy, all I retained of it was a multitude of\r\n  barbarous and dark words, proper to bewilder, perplex, and tire out\r\n  the best wits, and only invented the better to cover the vanity and\r\n  ignorance of men like yourself, that would make us believe that they\r\n  know all, and that under those obscure and ambiguous words are hid\r\n  great mysteries which they alone are capable to understand. If you had\r\n  season’d me with that philosophy which formeth the mind to\r\n  ratiocination, and insensibly accustoms it to be satisfied with\r\n  nothing but solid reasons, if you had given me those excellent\r\n  precepts and doctrines which raise the soul above the assaults of\r\n  fortune, and reduce her to an unshakeable and always equal temper, and\r\n  permit her not to be lifted up by prosperity nor debased by adversity;\r\n  if you had taken care to give me the knowledge of what we are and what\r\n  are the first principles of things, and had assisted me in forming in\r\n  my mind a fit idea of the greatness of the universe, and of the\r\n  admirable order and motion of the parts thereof; if, I say, you had\r\n  instilled into me this kind of philosophy, I should think myself\r\n  incomparably more obliged to you than Alexander was to his Aristotle,\r\n  and believe it my duty to recompense you otherwise than he did him.\r\n  Should not you, instead of your flattery, have taught me somewhat of\r\n  that point so important to a king, which is, what the reciprocal\r\n  duties are of a sovereign to his subjects and those of subjects to\r\n  their sovereign; and ought not you to have considered, that one day I\r\n  should be obliged with the sword to dispute my life and the crown with\r\n  my brothers? Is not that the destiny almost of all the sons of\r\n  Indostan? Have you ever taken any care to make me learn, what ’tis to\r\n  besiege a town or to set an army in array? For these things I am\r\n  obliged to others, not at all to you. Go, and retire to the village\r\n  whence you are come, and let nobody know who you are or what is become\r\n  of you.’\" [For another version of this speech see Bernier 154 ff.,\r\n  Manucci ii. 30 ff.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.13.22:\r\n\r\n  [_Historical Fragments of the Mogul Empire_, ed. 1782, p. 101.

I came a\r\n  stranger into this world, and a stranger I depart. I know nothing of\r\n  myself, what I am, and for what I am destined. The instant which\r\n  passed in power, hath left only sorrow behind it. I have not been the\r\n  guardian and protector of the empire. My valuable time has been passed\r\n  vainly. I had a patron in my own dwelling (conscience), but his\r\n  glorious light was unseen by my dim sight. Life is not lasting, there\r\n  is no vestige of departed breath, and all hopes from futurity are\r\n  lost. The fever has left me, but nothing of me remains but skin and\r\n  bone. My son (Kaum Buksh), though gone towards Beejapore, is still\r\n  near; and thou, my son, are yet nearer. The worthy of esteem, Shaw\r\n  Aulum, is far distant; and my grandson (Azeem Ooshaun), by the orders\r\n  of God, is arrived near Hindostan. The camp and followers, helpless\r\n  and alarmed, are like myself, full of affliction, restless as the\r\n  quicksilver. Separated from their lord, they know not if they have a\r\n  master or not.\r\n\r\n  “I brought nothing into this world, and, except the infirmities of\r\n  man, carry nothing out. I have a dread for my salvation, and with what\r\n  torments I may be punished. Though I have strong reliance on the\r\n  mercies and bounty of God, yet, regarding my actions, fear will not\r\n  quit me; but when I am gone, reflection will not remain. Come then\r\n  what may, I have launched my vessel to the waves. Though Providence\r\n  will protect the camp, yet, regarding appearances, the endeavours of\r\n  my sons are indispensably incumbent. Give my last prayers to my\r\n  grandson (Bedar Bukht), whom I cannot see, but the desire affects me.\r\n  The Begum (his daughter) appears afflicted; but God is the only judge\r\n  of hearts. The foolish thoughts of women produce nothing but\r\n  disappointment. Farewell! farewell! farewell!” [This letter is printed\r\n  by H.

Though in the height of my power, and by\r\n  God’s permission, I gave you advice, and took with you the greatest\r\n  pains, yet, as it was not the divine will, you did not attend with the\r\n  ears of compliance. Now I depart a stranger, and lament my own\r\n  insignificance, what does it profit me? I carry with me the fruits of\r\n  my sins and imperfections. Surprising Providence! I came here alone,\r\n  and alone I depart. The leader of this caravan hath deserted me. The\r\n  fever which troubled me for twelve days has left me. Wherever I look,\r\n  I see nothing but the divinity. My fears for the camp and followers\r\n  are great: but, alas! I know not myself. My back is bent with\r\n  weakness, and my feet have lost the powers of motion. The breath which\r\n  rose is gone, and left not even hope behind it. I have committed\r\n  numerous crimes, and know not with what punishments I may be seized.\r\n  Though the protector of mankind will guard the camp, yet care is\r\n  incumbent also on the faithful and my sons. When I was alive, no care\r\n  was taken; and now I am gone, the consequence may be guessed. The\r\n  guardianship of a people is the trust by God committed to my sons.\r\n  Azim Shaw is near. Be cautious that none of the faithful are slain, or\r\n  their miseries fall upon my head. I resign you, your mother and son,\r\n  to God, as I myself am going. The agonies of death come upon me fast.\r\n  Behadur Shaw is still where he was, and his son is arrived near\r\n  Hindostan. Bedar Bukht is in Guzarat.

Whatever good or\r\n  evil I have done, it was for you. Take it not amiss, nor remember what\r\n  offences I have done to yourself; that account may not be demanded of\r\n  me hereafter.

B. Rouse.\r\n\r\n                \"Letter from Rana Raj Singh to Aurangzeb.\r\n\r\n  \"All due praise be rendered to the glory of the Almighty, and the\r\n  munificence of your majesty, which is conspicuous as the sun and moon.\r\n  Although I, your well-wisher, have separated from your sublime\r\n  presence, I am nevertheless zealous in the performance of every\r\n  bounden act of obedience and loyalty. My ardent wishes and strenuous\r\n  services are employed to promote the prosperity of the Kings, Nobles,\r\n  Mirzas, Rajahs, and Roys of the provinces of Hindostan, and the chiefs\r\n  of Æraun, Turaun, Room, and Shawm, the inhabitants of the seven\r\n  climates, and all persons travelling by land and by water. This my\r\n  inclination is notorious, nor can your royal wisdom entertain a doubt\r\n  thereof. Reflecting therefore on my former services, and your\r\n  majesty’s condescension, I presume to solicit the royal attention to\r\n  some circumstances, in which the public as well as private welfare is\r\n  greatly interested.\r\n\r\n  \"I have been informed that enormous sums have been dissipated in the\r\n  prosecution of the designs formed against me, your well-wisher; and\r\n  that you have ordered a tribute to be levied to satisfy the exigencies\r\n  of your exhausted treasury.\r\n\r\n  \"May it please your majesty, your royal ancestor Mahomed Jelaul ul\r\n  Deen Akbar, whose throne is now in heaven, conducted the affairs of\r\n  this empire in equity and firm security for the space of fifty-two\r\n  years, preserving every tribe of men in ease and happiness, whether\r\n  they were followers of Jesus or of Moses, of David or Mahomed; were\r\n  they Brahmins, were they of the sect of Dharians, which denies the\r\n  eternity of matter, or of that which ascribes the existence of the\r\n  world to chance, they all equally enjoyed his countenance and favour:\r\n  insomuch that his people, in gratitude for the indiscriminate\r\n  protection he afforded them, distinguished him by the appellation of\r\n  _Juggut Gooroo_ (Guardian of Mankind).\r\n\r\n  \"His majesty Mahomed Noor ul Deen Jehangheer, likewise, whose dwelling\r\n  is now in paradise, extended, for a period of twenty-two years, the\r\n  shadow of his protection over the heads of his people; successful by a\r\n  constant fidelity to his allies, and a vigorous exertion of his arm in\r\n  business.\r\n\r\n  \"Nor less did the illustrious Shah Jehan, by a propitious reign of\r\n  thirty-two years, acquire to himself immortal reputation, the glorious\r\n  reward of clemency and virtue.\r\n\r\n  \"Such were the benevolent inclinations of your ancestors. Whilst they\r\n  pursued these great and generous principles, wheresoever they directed\r\n  their steps, conquest and prosperity went before them; and then they\r\n  reduced many countries and fortresses to their obedience. During your\r\n  majesty’s reign, many have been alienated from the empire, and farther\r\n  loss of territory must necessarily follow, since devastation and\r\n  rapine now universally prevail without restraint. Your subjects are\r\n  trampled under foot, and every province of your empire is\r\n  impoverished; depopulation spreads, and difficulties accumulate. When\r\n  indigence has reached the habitation of the sovereign and his princes,\r\n  what can be the condition of the nobles? As to the soldiery, they are\r\n  in murmurs; the merchants complaining, the Mahomedans discontented,\r\n  the Hindoos destitute, and multitudes of people, wretched even to the\r\n  want of their nightly meal, are beating their heads throughout the day\r\n  in rage and desperation.\r\n\r\n  \"How can the dignity of the sovereign be preserved who employs his\r\n  power in exacting heavy tributes from a people thus miserably reduced?\r\n  At this juncture it is told from east to west, that the emperor of\r\n  Hindostan, jealous of the poor Hindoo devotee, will exact a tribute\r\n  from Brahmins, Sanorahs, Joghies, Berawghies, Sanyasees; that,\r\n  regardless of the illustrious honour of his Timurcan race, he\r\n  condescends to exercise his power over the solitary inoffensive\r\n  anchoret. If your majesty places any faith in those books, by\r\n  distinction called divine, you will there be instructed that God is\r\n  the God of all mankind, not the God of Mahomedans alone. The Pagan and\r\n  the Mussulman are equally in His presence. Distinctions of colour are\r\n  of His ordination. It is He who gives existence. In your temples, to\r\n  His name the voice is raised in prayer; in a house of images, where\r\n  the bell is shaken, still He is the object of adoration. To vilify the\r\n  religion or customs of other men is to set at naught the pleasure of\r\n  the Almighty. When we deface a picture, we naturally incur the\r\n  resentment of the painter; and justly has the poet said, presume not\r\n  to arraign or scrutinize the various works of power divine.\r\n\r\n  “In fine, the tribute you demand from the Hindoos is repugnant to\r\n  justice: it is equally foreign from good policy, as it must impoverish\r\n  the country: moreover, it is an innovation and an infringement of the\r\n  laws of Hindostan. But if zeal for your own religion hath induced you\r\n  to determine upon this measure, the demand ought, by the rules of\r\n  equity, to have been made first upon Ramsing, who is esteemed the\r\n  principal amongst the Hindoos. Then let your well-wisher be called\r\n  upon, with whom you will have less difficulty to encounter; but to\r\n  torment ants and flies is unworthy of an heroic or generous mind. It\r\n  is wonderful that the ministers of your government should have\r\n  neglected to instruct your majesty in the rules of rectitude and\r\n  honour.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.13.29:\r\n\r\n  It is well known that Aurangzeb forbade the continuation of the\r\n  history of his life, subsequent to that portion comprehending the\r\n  first ten years [the _Ālamgīrnāma_; see Jadunath Sarkar ii. 302].\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.13.30:\r\n\r\n  The epithet by which these Tatar sovereigns affected to call the\r\n  indigenous (_bhumia_) princes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.13.31:\r\n\r\n  There were no such field trains in Europe as those of the Moguls.\r\n  Seventy pieces of heavy ordnance, sixty of horse artillery, and a\r\n  dromedary corps three hundred strong, mounting swivels, accompanied\r\n  the emperor on an excursion to Kashmir.

His tragical end is told later on.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.13.36:\r\n\r\n  The Saktawat leader, Gharibdas, has the merit of having prompted this\r\n  plan. His speech on the advance of Aurangzeb is given in the Annals;\r\n  and his advice, “Let the king have free entrance through the passes,\r\n  shut him in, and make famine his foe,” was literally followed, with\r\n  the hard knocks, which being a matter-of-course accompaniment, the\r\n  gallant Saktawat deemed it unnecessary to specify.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.13.37:\r\n\r\n  Orme, who has many valuable historical details of this period, makes\r\n  Aurangzeb in person to have been in the predicament assigned by the\r\n  annals to his son, and to have escaped from the operation of those\r\n  high and gallant sentiments of the Rajput, which make him no match for\r\n  a wily adversary.\r\n\r\n  “In the meantime Aurengzebe was carrying on the war against the Rana\r\n  of Cheetore, and the Raja of Marwar, who on the approach of his army\r\n  at the end of the preceding year, 1678, had abandoned the accessible\r\n  country, and drew their herds and inhabitants into the vallies, within\r\n  the mountains; the army advanced amongst the defiles with incredible\r\n  labour, and with so little intelligence, that the division which moved\r\n  with Aurengzebe himself was unexpectedly stopped by insuperable\r\n  defences and precipices in front; whilst the Rajpoots in one night\r\n  closed the streights in his rear, by felling the overhanging trees;\r\n  and from their stations above prevented all endeavours of the troops,\r\n  either within or without, from removing the obstacle. Udeperri, the\r\n  favourite and Circassian wife of Aurengzebe, accompanied him in this\r\n  arduous war, and with her retinue and escort was enclosed in another\r\n  part of the mountains; her conductors, dreading to expose her person\r\n  to danger or public view, surrendered. She was carried to the Rana,\r\n  who received her with homage and every attention. Meanwhile the\r\n  emperor himself might have perished by famine, of which the Rana let\r\n  him see the risque, by a confinement of two days; when he ordered his\r\n  Rajpoots to withdraw from their stations, and suffer the way to be\r\n  cleared. As soon as Aurengzebe was out of danger, the Rana sent back\r\n  his wife, accompanied by a chosen escort, who only requested in return\r\n  that he would refrain from destroying the sacred animals of their\r\n  religion which might still be left in the plains; but Aurengzebe, who\r\n  believed in no virtue but self-interest, imputed the generosity and\r\n  forbearance of the Rana to the fear of future vengeance, and continued\r\n  the war. Soon after he was again well-nigh enclosed in the mountains.\r\n  This second experience of difficulties beyond his age and\r\n  constitution, and the arrival of his sons, Azim and Acbar, determined\r\n  him not to expose himself any longer in the field, but to leave its\r\n  operations to their conduct, superintended by his own instructions\r\n  from Azmir; to which city he retired with the households of his\r\n  family, the officers of his court, and his bodyguard of four thousand\r\n  men, dividing the army between his two sons, who each had brought a\r\n  considerable body of troops from their respective governments. They\r\n  continued the war each in a different part of the country, and neither\r\n  at the end of the year had forced the ultimate passes of the\r\n  mountains” [_Historical Fragments_, 119 f.].\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.13.38:\r\n\r\n  [Dilīr Khan, otherwise Jalāl Khān Dā‛ūdzai, died at Aurangābād,\r\n  1682-83 (Manucci i. 243).

A circumstance occurred at his\r\nbirth, which as descriptive of manners may deserve notice. A few hours\r\nonly intervened between his entrance into the world and that of another\r\nson called Bhim. It is customary for the father to bind round the arm of\r\nthe new-born infant a root of that species of grass called the\r\n_amardub_, the ‘imperishable’ _dub_, well known for its nutritive\r\nproperties and luxuriant vegetation under the most intense heat.[4.14.2]\r\nThe Rana first attached the ligature round the arm of the youngest,\r\napparently an oversight, though in fact from superior affection for his\r\nmother. As the boys approached to manhood, the Rana, apprehensive that\r\nthis preference might create dissension, one day drew his sword, and\r\nplacing it in the hand of Bhim (the elder), said, it was better to use\r\nit at once on his brother, than hereafter to endanger the safety of the\r\nState. This [392] appeal to his generosity had an instantaneous effect,\r\nand he not only ratified, ‘by his father’s throne,’[4.14.3] the\r\nacknowledgment of the sovereign rights of his brother, but declared, to\r\nremove all fears, “he was not his son if he again drank water within the\r\npass of Debari”; and, collecting his retainers, he abandoned Udaipur to\r\ncourt Fortune where she might be kinder. The day was sultry, and on\r\nreaching the barrier he halted under the shade of a sacred fig-tree to\r\nbestow a last look upon the place of his birth. His cup-bearer\r\n(_Paniyari_) brought his silver goblet filled from the cool fountain,\r\nbut as he raised it to his lips, he recollected that his vow was\r\nincomplete while within the portal; he poured the libation on the earth\r\nin the name of the Supreme, and casting the cup as an offering to the\r\ndeity of the fountain, the huge gates closed upon the valley. He\r\nproceeded to Bahadur Shah, who conferred upon him the dignity (_mansab_)\r\nof a leader of three thousand five hundred horse, with the Bawana, or\r\nfifty-two districts for their support: but quarrelling with the imperial\r\ngeneral, he was detached with his contingent west of the Indus, where he\r\ndied.[4.14.4]\r\n\r\n=Treaty between Rāna Jai Singh and Aurangzeb.=—Let us return to Jai\r\nSingh (_the lion of victory_). He concluded a treaty with Aurangzeb,\r\nconducted by Prince Azam and Dilir Khan, who took every occasion to\r\ntestify his gratitude for the clemency of Rana Raj Singh, when blockaded\r\nin the defiles of the Aravalli. At this conference, the Rana was\r\nattended by ten thousand horse and forty thousand foot, besides the\r\nmultitude collected from the mountains to view the ceremony, above one\r\nhundred thousand souls, who set up a shout of joy at the prospect of\r\nrevisiting the plains, which disconcerted Azam, while Dilir expatiated\r\non the perils from which the Rana’s generosity had liberated him. Azam,\r\nwho said he was no stranger to the Rana’s illustrious house, concluded a\r\ntreaty on the spot, in which, as a salvo for the imperial dignity, a\r\nnominal fine and surrender of three districts were inserted for aiding\r\nAkbar’s rebellion, and a hint that the regal colour (_crimson_) of his\r\ntents and umbrella [393] should be discontinued. That advantages were\r\ngained by the Rana, we may infer from Dilir’s sons being left as\r\nhostages for Azam’s good faith; a fact we learn from his farewell\r\naddress to the Rana! “Your nobles are rude, and my children are the\r\nhostages of your safety; but if at the expense of their lives I can\r\nobtain the entire restoration of your country, keep your mind at ease,\r\nfor there was friendship between your father and me.”\r\n\r\n=The Jaisamund Lake.=—But all other protection than what his sword\r\nafforded was futile; and though Dilir’s intentions were noble, he had\r\nlittle control over events: in less than five years after his accession,\r\nthe Rana was again forced to fly the plains for the inaccessible haunts\r\nof Kamori. Yet, in spite of these untoward circumstances and\r\nuninterrupted warfare, such were the resources of this little State that\r\nthe Rana completed a work which perpetuates his name. He threw a dam\r\nacross a break in the mountains, the channel of an ever-flowing stream,\r\nby which he formed the largest lake in India,[4.14.5] giving it his own\r\nname, the Jaisamund, or sea of victory. Nature had furnished the hint\r\nfor this undertaking, for there had always existed a considerable volume\r\nof water; but the Rana had the merit of uniting these natural\r\nbuttresses, and creating a little sea from the Dhebar pool, its ancient\r\nappellation. The circumference cannot be less than thirty miles, and the\r\nbenefits to cultivation, especially in respect to the article of rice,\r\nwhich requires perpetual irrigation, were great. On this huge rampart he\r\nerected a palace for his favourite queen, Komaladevi, a princess of the\r\nPramara race, familiarly known as the Ruthi Rani, or ‘testy queen.’\r\n\r\n=Rana Jai Singh and his heir Amar Singh.=—Domestic unhappiness appears\r\nto have generated in the Rana inaptitude to state affairs; and,\r\nunluckily, the favoured queen estranged him from his son. Amra, a name\r\nvenerated in Mewar, was that of the heir of Jai Singh. His mother was of\r\nthe Bundi house, a family which has performed great services to, and\r\nbrought great calamities upon, the ancient sovereigns of Mewar. To the\r\njealousies of the rival queens, one of them mother to the heir, the\r\nother the favourite of the sovereign, are attributed dissensions, which\r\nat such a juncture were a greater detriment than the loss of a battle,\r\nand which afford another illustration, if any were wanting, of the\r\nimpolicy of polygamy. The annals of Mewar seldom exhibit those unnatural\r\ncontentions for power, from which no other Hindu State was exempt; this\r\nwas owing to the wholesome regulation of not investing the princes of\r\nthe blood with any [394] political authority; and establishing as a\r\ncounterpoise to natural advantages an artificial degradation of their\r\nrank, which placed them beneath the sixteen chief nobles of the State;\r\nwhich, while it exalted these in their own estimation, lessened the\r\nnational humiliation, when the heirs-apparent were compelled to lead\r\ntheir quota in the _arrière-ban_ of the empire.\r\n\r\n=Rebellion of Amar Singh.=—Rana Jai Singh, who had evinced such\r\ngallantry and activity in the wars of Aurangzeb, now secluded himself\r\nwith Komala in the retreat of Jaisamund, leaving Amra under the guidance\r\nof the Pancholi[4.14.6] minister, at the capital. But he having\r\npersonally insulted this chief officer of the State, in consequence of\r\nreceiving a rebuke for turning loose an infuriated elephant in the town,\r\nthe Rana left his retreat, and visiting Chitor in his tour, arrived at\r\nUdaipur. Amra awaited not his father’s arrival, but adding his mother’s\r\nresentments to a feeling of patriotic indignation at the abasement his\r\nindolence produced, fled to Bundi, took up arms, and, joined by many of\r\nhis own nobles and Hara auxiliaries, returned at the head of ten\r\nthousand men. Desirous of averting civil war, the Rana retired to Godwar\r\nbeyond the Aravalli, whence he sent the Ghanerao chieftain, the first\r\nfeudatory of that department, to expostulate with his son. But Amra,\r\nsupported by three-fourths of the nobles, made direct for Kumbhalmer to\r\nsecure the State treasure, saved by the Depra governor for his\r\nsovereign. A failure in this project, the knowledge that the Rathors\r\nfostered the quarrel with a view to obtain Godwar, and the determination\r\nof the few chiefs yet faithful[4.14.7] to the Rana, to defend the\r\nJhilwara pass to the last, made the prince listen to terms, which were\r\nratified at the shrine of Eklinga, whereby the Rana was to return to the\r\ncapital, and the prince to abide in exile at the new palace during the\r\nlife of his father, which closed twenty years after his accession. Had\r\nhe maintained the reputation he established in his early years, the\r\ntimes were well calculated for the redemption of his country’s\r\nindependence; but documents which yet exist afford little reason to\r\ndoubt that in his latter years a state of indolence, having all the\r\neffects of imbecility, supervened, and but for the formation of ‘the\r\nvictorious sea,’ would have left his name a blank in the traditional\r\nhistory of Mewar.\r\n\r\n=Rāna Amar Singh II., A.D. 1698-1710.=—Amra II., who succeeded in S.\r\n1756 (A.D. 1700), had much of the gallantry [395] and active turn of\r\nmind of his illustrious namesake; but the degrading conflict with his\r\nfather had much impaired the moral strength of the country, and\r\ncounteracted the advantages which might have resulted from the decline\r\nof the Mogul power. The reigns of Raj Singh and Jai Singh illustrate the\r\nobvious truth, that on the personal character of the chief of a feudal\r\ngovernment everything depends. The former, infusing by his talent and\r\nenergy patriotic sentiments into all his subordinates, vanquished in a\r\nseries of conflicts the vast military resources of the empire, led by\r\nthe emperor, his sons, and chosen generals; while his successor, heir to\r\nthis moral strength, and with every collateral aid, lowered her to a\r\nstage of contempt from which no talent could subsequently raise her.\r\n\r\nAmra early availed himself of the contentions amongst the sons of\r\nAurangzeb to anticipate events, and formed a private treaty[4.14.8] with\r\nthe Mogul heir-apparent, Shah Alam, when commanded to the countries west\r\nof the Indus, on which occasion [396] the Mewar contingent[4.14.9]\r\naccompanied him, and fought several gallant actions under a Saktawat\r\nchieftain.\r\n\r\n=Breach between the Rājputs and the Mughal Empire.=—It is important to\r\nstudy the events of this period, which involved the overthrow of the\r\nMogul power, and originated that form of society which paved the way to\r\nthe dominion of Britain in these distant regions. From such a review a\r\npolitical lesson of great value may be learned, which will show a beacon\r\nwarning us against the danger of trusting to mere physical power,\r\nunaided by the latent, but more durable support of moral influence. When\r\nAurangzeb neglected the indigenous Rajputs, he endangered the keystone\r\nof his power; and in despising opinion, though his energetic mind might\r\nfor a time render him independent of it, yet long before his death the\r\nenormous fabric reared by Akbar was tottering to its foundation:\r\ndemonstrating to conviction that the highest order of talent, either for\r\ngovernment or war, though aided by unlimited resources, will not suffice\r\nfor the maintenance of power, unsupported by the affections of the\r\ngoverned. The empire of Aurangzeb was more extensive than that of\r\nBritain at this day—the elements of stability were incomparably more\r\ntenacious: he was associated with the Rajputs by blood, which seemed to\r\nguarantee a respect for their opinions; he possessed the power of\r\ndistributing the honours and emoluments of the state, when a service\r\ncould be rewarded by a province,[4.14.10] drawing at will supplies of\r\nwarriors from the mountains of the west, as a check on his indigenous\r\nsubjects, while these left the plains of India to control the Afghan\r\namidst the snows of Caucasus. But the most devoted attachment and most\r\nfaithful service were repaid by insults to their habits, and the\r\nimposition of an obnoxious tax; and to the jizya, and the unwise\r\npertinacity with which his successors adhered to it, must be directly\r\nascribed the overthrow of the monarchy. No condition was exempted from\r\nthis odious and impolitic assessment, which was deemed by the tyrant a\r\nmild substitute for the conversion he once meditated of the entire Hindu\r\nrace to the creed of Islam.[4.14.11]\r\n\r\n=Rājput Apostates.=—An abandonment of their faith was the Rajput’s\r\nsurest road to the tyrant’s favour [397], and an instance of this\r\ndereliction in its consequences powerfully contributed to the\r\nannihilation of the empire. Rao Gopal, a branch of the Rana’s family,\r\nheld the fief of Rampura, on the Chambal,[4.14.12] and was serving with\r\na select quota of his clan in the wars of the Deccan, when his son, who\r\nhad been left at home, withheld the revenues, which he applied to his\r\nown use instead of remitting them to his father. Rao Gopal complained to\r\nthe emperor; but the son discovered that he could by a sacrifice not\r\nonly appease Aurangzeb, but attain the object of his wishes: he\r\napostatized from his faith, and obtained the emperor’s forgiveness, with\r\nthe domain of Rampura. Disgusted and provoked at such infurious conduct,\r\nRao Gopal fled the camp, made an unsuccessful attempt to redeem his\r\nestate, and took refuge with Rana Amra, his suzerain. This natural\r\nasylum granted to a chief of his own kin was construed by the tyrant\r\ninto a signal of revolt, and Azam was ordered to Malwa to watch the\r\nRana’s motions: conduct thus characterized in the memoirs of a Rajput\r\nchieftain,[4.14.13] one of the most devoted to Aurangzeb, and who died\r\nfighting for his son. “The emperor showed but little favour to his\r\nfaithful and most useful subjects the Rajputs, which greatly cooled\r\ntheir ardour in his service.” The Rana took up arms, and Malwa joined\r\nthe tumult; while the first irruption of the Mahrattas across the\r\nNerbudda,[4.14.14] under Nima Sindhia, compelled the emperor to detach\r\nRaja Jai Singh to join Prince Azam. Amidst these accumulated troubles,\r\nthe Mahrattas rising into importance, the Rajput feudatories disgusted\r\nand alienated, his sons and grandsons ready to commit each individual\r\npretension to the decision of the sword, did Aurangzeb, after a reign of\r\nterror of half a century’s duration, breathe his last on the 28th\r\nZilqa’da, A.D. 1707 [February 21], at the city bearing his\r\nname—Aurangabad.\r\n\r\n=Shāh Alam Bahādur Shāh, Emperor, A.D. 1707-12.=—At his death his second\r\nson Azam assumed the imperial dignity, and aided by the Rajput princes\r\nof Datia and Kotah,[4.14.15] who had always served in his division, he\r\nmarched to Agra to contest the legitimate claims of his eldest brother\r\nMuazzam, who was advancing from Kabul supported by the contingents of\r\nMewar and Marwar, and all western Rajwara. The battle of Jajau[4.14.16]\r\n[398] was fatal to Azam, who with his son Bedarbakht and the princes of\r\nKotah and Datia was slain, when Muazzam ascended the throne under the\r\ntitle of Shah Alam Bahadur Shah. This prince had many qualities which\r\nendeared him to the Rajputs, to whom his sympathies were united by the\r\nties of blood, his mother being a Rajput princess.[4.14.17] Had he\r\nimmediately succeeded the beneficent Shah Jahan, the race of Timur, in\r\nall human probability, would have been still enthroned at Delhi, and\r\nmight have presented a picture of one of the most powerful monarchies of\r\nAsia. But Aurangzeb had inflicted an incurable wound on the mind of the\r\nHindu race, which for ever estranged them from his successors; nor were\r\nthe virtues of Bahadur, during the short lustre of his sway, capable of\r\nhealing it. The bitter fruit of a long experience had taught the Rajputs\r\nnot to hope for amelioration from any graft of that stem, which, like\r\nthe deadly Upas, had stifled the vital energies of Rajasthan, whose\r\nleaders accordingly formed a league for mutual preservation, which it\r\nwould have been madness to dissolve merely because a fair portion of\r\nvirtue was the inheritance of the tyrant’s successor. They had proved\r\nthat no act of duty or subserviency could guarantee them from the\r\ninfatuated abuse of power, and they were at length steeled against every\r\nappeal to their loyalty, replying with a trite adage, which we may\r\ntranslate ‘_quem Deus vult perdere, prius dementat_,’—of common\r\napplication with the Rajput in such a predicament.\r\n\r\n=The Rise of the Sikhs.=—The emperor was soon made to perceive the\r\nlittle support he had in future to expect from the Rajputs. Scarcely had\r\nhe quashed the pretensions of Kambakhsh, his youngest brother, who\r\nproclaimed himself emperor in the Deccan, than he was forced to the\r\nnorth, in consequence of an insurrection of the Sikhs of Lahore. This\r\nsingular race, the disciples (_sikhs_) of a teacher called Nanak, were\r\nthe descendants of the Scythic Getae,[4.14.18] or Jat, of Transoxiana,\r\nwho so early as the fifth century were established in the tract watered\r\nby the five arms (_Panjab_) of the Indus. Little more than a century has\r\nelapsed since their conversion from a spurious Hinduism to the doctrines\r\nof the sectarian Nanak, and their first attempt to separate themselves,\r\nin temporal as well as spiritual matters, from all control, and they are\r\nnow the sole independent power within the limits [399] of the Mogul\r\nmonarchy. On this occasion[4.14.19] the princes of Amber and Marwar\r\nvisited the emperor, but left his camp without permission, and, as the\r\nhistorian[4.14.20] adds, manifested a design to struggle for\r\nindependence. Such was the change in their mutual circumstances that the\r\nMogul sent the heir-apparent to conciliate and conduct them to him; but\r\nthey came at the head of all their native bands, when “they were\r\ngratified with whatever their insolence demanded”:[4.14.21] a splenetic\r\neffusion of the historian, which well paints their altered position.\r\nFrom the royal _urdu_,[4.14.22] or camp, they repaired to Rana Amra at\r\nUdaipur, where a triple league was formed, which once more united them\r\nto the head of their nation. This treaty of unity of interests against\r\nthe common foe was solemnized by nuptial engagements, from which those\r\nprinces had been excluded since the reigns of Akbar and Partap. To be\r\nreadmitted to this honour was the basis of this triple alliance, in\r\nwhich they ratified on oath the renunciation of all connexion, domestic\r\nor political, with the empire. It was, moreover, stipulated that the\r\nsons of such marriage should be heirs, or if the issue were females,\r\nthat they should never be dishonoured by being married to a Mogul.\r\n\r\n=Sacrifice of the Right of Primogeniture.=—But this remedy, as will be\r\nseen, originated a worse disease; it was a sacrifice of the rights of\r\nprimogeniture (clung to by the Rajputs with extreme pertinacity),\r\nproductive of the most injurious effects, which introduced domestic\r\nstrife, and called upon the stage an umpire not less baneful than the\r\npower from whose iron grasp they were on the point of freeing\r\nthemselves: for although this treaty laid prostrate the throne of Babur,\r\nit ultimately introduced the Mahrattas as partisans in their family\r\ndisputes, who made the bone of contention their own.\r\n\r\nThe injudicious support afforded by the emperor to the apostate chief of\r\nRampura first brought the triple federation into action. The Rana,\r\nupholding the cause of Himmat Singh, made an attack on Rampura, which\r\nthe apostate usurper Ratan Singh, now Raj Muslim Khan, defeated, and was\r\nrewarded for [400] it by the emperor.[4.14.23] But the same report\r\nconveyed to the king “that the Rana determined to lay waste his country,\r\nand retire to the hills,”[4.14.24] which was speedily confirmed by the\r\nunwelcome intelligence that Sawaldas, an officer of the Rana’s, had\r\nattacked Firoz Khan, the governor of Pur Mandal, who was obliged to\r\nretreat with great loss to Ajmer;[4.14.25] on which occasion this loyal\r\ndescendant of the illustrious Jaimall lost his life.[4.14.26] The brave\r\nDurgadas, who conveyed the rebellious Akbar through all opposition to a\r\nplace of refuge, again appeared upon the stage—his own prince being\r\nunable to protect him, he had found a safe asylum at Udaipur, and had\r\nthe sum of five hundred rupees daily paid for his expenditure—a princely\r\nliberality. But the result of this combination was reserved for the\r\nfollowing reigns, Shah Alam being carried off by poison,[4.14.27] ere he\r\ncould correct the disorders which were rapidly breaking up the empire\r\nfrom the Hindu-Kush to the ocean. Had his life been spared, his talents\r\nfor business, his experience, and courteous manners might have retarded\r\nthe ruin of the monarchy, which the utter unworthiness of his successor\r\nsunk beyond the power of man to redeem. Every subsequent succession was\r\nthrough blood; and the sons of Shah Alam performed the part for which\r\nthey had so many great examples. Two brothers,[4.14.28] Sayyids, from\r\nthe town of Barha in the Duab, were long the Warwicks of Hindustan,\r\nsetting up and plucking down its puppet kings at their pleasure; they\r\nhad elevated Farrukhsiyar when the triumvirs of Rajasthan commenced\r\ntheir operations.\r\n\r\n=Farrukhsīyar, Emperor, A.D. 1712-19.=—Giving loose to long-suppressed\r\nresentment, the Rajputs abandoned the spirit of toleration which it\r\nwould have been criminal to preserve; and profiting by the lessons of\r\ntheir tyrants, they overthrew the mosques built on the sites of their\r\naltars, and treated the civil and religious officers of the government\r\nwith indignity. Of these every town in Rajasthan had its _mulla_ to\r\nproclaim the name of Muhammad, and its _kazi_ for the administration of\r\njustice,—branches of government [401] entirely wrested from the hands of\r\nthe native princes,[4.14.29] abusing the name of independence. But for a\r\nmoment it was redeemed, especially by the brave Rathors, who had made a\r\nnoble resistance, contesting every foot of land since the death of\r\nJaswant Singh, and now his son Ajit entirely expelled the Moguls from\r\nMarwar. On this occasion the native forces of the triple alliance met at\r\nthe salt lake of Sambhar, which was made the common boundary of their\r\nterritory, and its revenues were equally divided amongst them.\r\n\r\nThe pageant of an emperor, guided by the Sayyids, or those who intrigued\r\nto supplant their ministry, made an effort to oppose the threatening\r\nmeasures of the Rajputs; and one of them, the Amiru-l-umara,[4.14.30]\r\nmarched against Raja Ajit, who received private instructions from the\r\nemperor to resist his commander-in-chief, whose credit was strengthened\r\nby the means taken to weaken it, which engendered suspicions of\r\ntreachery. Ajit leagued with the Sayyids, who held out to the Rathor an\r\nimportant share of power at court, and agreed to pay tribute and give a\r\ndaughter in marriage to Farrukhsiyar.\r\n\r\n=Marriage of Farrukhsīyar: Grant to the British.=—This marriage yielded\r\nmost important results, which were not confined to the Moguls or\r\nRajputs, for to it may be ascribed the rise of the British power in\r\nIndia. A dangerous malady,[4.14.31] rendering necessary a surgical\r\noperation upon Farrukhsiyar, to which the faculty of the court were\r\nunequal, retarded the celebration of the nuptials between the emperor\r\nand the Rajput princess of Marwar, and even threatened a fatal\r\ntermination. A mission from the British merchants at Surat was at that\r\ntime at court, and, as a last resource, the surgeon attached to it was\r\ncalled in, who cured the malady, and made the emperor happy in his\r\nbride.[4.14.32] His gratitude was displayed with oriental magnificence.\r\nThe emperor desired Mr. Hamilton to name [402] his reward, and to the\r\ndisinterested patriotism of this individual did the British owe the\r\nfirst royal grant or farman, conferring territorial possession and great\r\ncommercial privileges. These were the objects of the mission, which till\r\nthis occurrence had proved unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThis gorgeous court ought to have been, and probably was, impressed with\r\na high opinion of the virtuous self-denial of the inhabitants of\r\nBritain; and if history has correctly preserved the transaction, some\r\nmark of public gratitude should have been forthcoming from those who so\r\nsignally benefited thereby. But to borrow the phraseology of the Italian\r\nhistorian, “Obligations which do not admit of being fully discharged are\r\noften repaid with the coin of ingratitude”: the remains of this man rest\r\nin the churchyard of Calcutta, without even a stone to mark the\r\nspot![4.14.33]\r\n\r\n=The Jizya Reimposed.=—This marriage, which promised a renewal of\r\ninterests with the Rajputs, was soon followed by the revival of the\r\nobnoxious jizya. The character of this tax, though much altered from its\r\noriginal imposition by Aurangzeb, when it was at once financial and\r\nreligious, was held in unmitigated abhorrence by the Hindus from the\r\ncomplex association; and although it was revived chiefly to relieve\r\npecuniary wants, it kindled a universal feeling of hatred amongst all\r\nclasses, and quenched the little zeal which the recent marriage had\r\ninspired in the Rajputs of the desert. The mode and channel of its\r\nintroduction evinced to them that there was no hope that the intolerant\r\nspirit which originally suggested it would ever be subdued. The weak\r\nFarrukhsiyar, desirous of snapping the leading-strings of the Sayyids,\r\nrecalled to his court Inayatu-lla Khan,[4.14.34] the minister of\r\nAurangzeb, and restored to him his office of Diwan, who, to use the\r\nwords of the historian of the period, \"did not consult the temper of the\r\ntimes, so very different from the reign of Aurangzeb, and the revival of\r\nthe _jizya_ came with him.\" Though by no means severe in its operation,\r\nnot amounting to three-quarters per cent on annual income,[4.14.35]—from\r\nwhich the lame, the blind, and very poor were exempt,—it nevertheless\r\nraised a general spirit of hostility, particularly from its retaining\r\nthe insulting distinction of a ‘tax on infidels.’ Resistance to taxation\r\nappears to be a universal feeling, in which even the Asiatic forgets the\r\ndivine right of sovereignty, and which throws us back on the pervading\r\nspirit of selfishness which [403] governs human nature. The\r\n_tamgha_,[4.14.36] or stamp tax, which preceded the _jizya_, would\r\nappear to have been as unsatisfactory as it was general, from the\r\nsolemnity of its renunciation by Babur on the field of battle after the\r\nvictory over infidels, which gave him the crown of India; and though we\r\nhave no record of the jizya being its substitute, there are indications\r\nwhich authorize the inference.\r\n\r\n=Rāna Amar Singh asserts Rājput Independence.=—Rana Amra was not an idle\r\nspectator of these occurrences; and although the spurious thirst for\r\ndistinction so early broke up the alliance by detaching Ajit, he\r\nredoubled his efforts for personal independence, and with it that of the\r\nRajput nation. An important document attests this solicitude, namely, a\r\ntreaty[4.14.37] with the emperor, in which the second article stipulates\r\nemancipation from the galling _jizya._ It may be well to analyse this\r\ntreaty, which attests the altered condition of both parties. Its very\r\ntitle marks the subordination of the chief of the Rajputs; but while\r\nthis is headed a ‘Memorandum of Requests,’ the eighth article discloses\r\nthe effective means of the Rana, for there he assumes an air of\r\nprotection towards the emperor. In the opening stipulation for the\r\n_mansab_ of 7000, the [404] mind reverts to the great Amra, who\r\npreferred abdication to acknowledgment of a superior; but opinion had\r\nundergone a change as great as the mutual relations of the Rajputs. In\r\ntemporal dignities other States had risen to an equality with Mewar, and\r\nall had learned to look on the Mogul as the fountain of honour. The\r\nabolition of the jizya, freedom from religious restraint, control over\r\nthe ancient feudatories of his house, and the restoration of all\r\nsequestrations, distinguish the other articles, and amply attest the\r\nimproving attitude of Mewar, and the rapid decay of the Mogul empire.\r\nThe Mahrattas under Raja Sahu[4.14.38] were successfully prosecuting\r\ntheir peculiar system in the south, with the same feelings which\r\ncharacterized the early Gothic invaders of Italy; strangers to settled\r\ngovernment, they imposed the taxes of _chauth_ and _desmukhi_,[4.14.39]\r\nthe _fourth_ and _tenth_ of all territorial income, in the countries\r\nthey overran. The Jat tribes west of the Chambal likewise bearded their\r\noppressors in this reign, by hoisting the standard of independence at\r\nthe very threshold of their capital; and from the siege of Sinsini\r\n(mentioned in this treaty) to the last storm of Bharatpur, they\r\nmaintained the consequence thus assumed.\r\n\r\n=Death of Rāna Amar Singh.=—This treaty was the last act of Rana Amra’s\r\nlife; he died in A.D. 1716 [1710], leaving the reputation of an active\r\nand high-minded prince, who well upheld his station and the prosperity\r\nof his country, notwithstanding the anarchy of the period. His\r\nencouragement of agriculture and protection of manufactures are\r\ndisplayed in the edicts engraved on pillars, which will hand down his\r\nname to posterity. His memory is held in high veneration; nor do the\r\nRajputs admit the absolute degradation of Mewar till the period of the\r\nsecond prince in succession to Amra [405].\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.14.1:\r\n\r\n  ‘_The Cushion_,’ by which a Rajput throne is designated.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.14.2:\r\n\r\n  [Dūb, _Cynodon dactylon_, the most common and useful Indian grass\r\n  (Watt, _Comm.

In all the treaties which have come\r\n  under my observation, the insertion of an article against the\r\n  slaughter of kine was prominent. This sacrifice to their national\r\n  prejudices was the subject of discussion with every ambassador when\r\n  the States of Rajasthan formed engagements with the British Government\r\n  in 1817-18, “the prohibition of kine-killing within their respective\r\n  limits.” From the construction of our armies we could not guarantee\r\n  this article, but assurances were given that every practical attention\r\n  would be paid to their wishes; and kine are not absolutely slain\r\n  within the jurisdiction of any of these Rajput princes. But even long\r\n  habit, though it has familiarized, has not reconciled them to this\r\n  revolting sacrifice; nor would the kine-killer in Mewar be looked upon\r\n  with less detestation than was Cambyses by the Egyptians, when he\r\n  thrust his lance into the flank of Apis. But in time this will be\r\n  overlooked, and the verbal assurance will become a dead letter; men of\r\n  good intention will be lulled into the belief that, because not openly\r\n  combated, the prejudice is extinct, and that homage to our power has\r\n  obliterated this article of their creed. Thus Aurangzeb thought, but\r\n  he avowedly and boldly opposed the religious opinions of his\r\n  tributaries; we only hold them in contempt, and even protect them when\r\n  productive of no sacrifice. Yet if we look back on the early page of\r\n  history, we shall find both policy and benevolence combined to form\r\n  this legislative protection to one of the most useful of domestic\r\n  animals, and which would tempt the belief that Triptolemus, the\r\n  lawgiver of Sparta, had borrowed from Manu [_Laws_, xi. 60, 69, 71],\r\n  or rather from the still greater friends of dumb creatures, the Jains,\r\n  in the law which exempted not only the lordly bull from the knife, but\r\n  “every living thing.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.14.8.B:\r\n\r\n  The Mewar contingent had been serving under Azam in the south, as the\r\n  following letter from him to the Rana discloses:—“Be it known to Rana\r\n  Amra Singh, your arzi [petition] arrived, and the accounts of your\r\n  mother gave me great grief, but against the decrees of God there is no\r\n  struggling. Pray for my welfare. Raja Rae Singh made a request for\r\n  you; you are my own; rest in full confidence and continue in your\r\n  obedience. The lands of your illustrious ancestors shall all be\r\n  yours—but this is the time to evince your duty—the rest learn from\r\n  your own servants—continue to think of me.”\r\n\r\n  “Your Rajputs have behaved well.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.14.9:\r\n\r\n  It consisted of twenty-two _Nakkaraband_ chiefs, _i.e._ each entitled\r\n  to a kettle-drum, and fifteen _Turais_, or chiefs, entitled to brass\r\n  trumpets.

He ascended the throne about\r\nthe same time with Muhammad Shah,[4.15.1] the last of the race of Timur\r\nwho deserved the name of emperor of India. During the reign of Sangram,\r\nfrom A.D. 1716 to 1734, this mighty empire was dismembered; when, in\r\nlieu of one paramount authority, numerous independent governments\r\nstarted up, which preserved their uncertain existence until the last\r\nrevolution, which has given a new combination to these discordant\r\nmaterials—Muhammadan, Mahratta, and Rajput, in the course of one century\r\nunder the dominion of a handful of Britons! Like the Satraps of the\r\nancient Persian, or the Lieutenants of Alexander, each chief proclaimed\r\nhimself master of the province, the government of which was confided to\r\nhis loyalty and talents; and it cannot fail to diminish any regret at\r\nthe successive prostration of Bengal, Oudh, Haidarabad, and other less\r\nconspicuous States, to remember that they were founded in rebellion, and\r\nerected on ingratitude; and that their rulers were destitute of those\r\nsympathies, which could alone give stability to their ephemeral\r\ngreatness, by improving the condition of their subjects. With the\r\nMahrattas the case is different: their emergence to power claims our\r\nadmiration, when tyranny transformed the industrious husbandman, and the\r\nminister of religion, into a hardy and enterprising soldier, and a\r\nskilful functionary of government. Had their ambition been restrained\r\nwithin legitimate bounds, it would have been no less gratifying than\r\npolitically and morally just that the family of Sivaji should have\r\nretained its [406] authority in countries which his active valour\r\nwrested from Aurangzeb. But the genius of conquest changed their natural\r\nhabits; they devastated instead of consolidating; and in lieu of that\r\nsevere and frugal simplicity, and that energy of enterprise, which were\r\ntheir peculiar characteristics, they became distinguished for mean\r\nparsimony, low cunning, and dastardly depredation. Had they, retaining\r\ntheir original character, been content with their proper sphere of\r\naction, the Deccan, they might yet have held the sovereignty of that\r\nvast region, where their habits and language assimilated them with the\r\npeople. But as they spread over the north they encountered national\r\nantipathies, and though professing the same creed, a wider difference in\r\nsentiment divided the Mahratta from the Rajput, than from the despots of\r\nDelhi, whose tyrannical intolerance was more endurable, because less\r\ndegrading, than the rapacious meanness of the Southron. Rajasthan\r\nbenefited by the demolition of the empire: to all but Mewar it yielded\r\nan extension of power. Had the national mind been allowed to repose, and\r\nits energies to recruit, after so many centuries of demoralization, all\r\nwould have recovered their strength, which lay in the opinions and\r\nindustry of the people, a devoted tenantry and brave vassalage, whom we\r\nhave so often depicted as abandoning their habitations and pursuits to\r\naid the patriotic views of their princes.\r\n\r\n=Deposition of Farrukhsīyar: Nizāmu-l-mulk.=—The short reign of\r\nFarrukhsiyar was drawing to a close; its end was accelerated by the very\r\nmeans by which that monarch hoped to emancipate himself from the\r\nthraldom of the Sayyids, against whose authority the faction of\r\nInayatu-lla was but a feeble counterpoise, and whose arbitrary habits,\r\nin the re-establishment of the jizya, lost him even the support of the\r\nfather of his queen. It was on this occasion that the celebrated\r\nNizamu-l-mulk,[4.15.2] the founder of the Haidarabad State, was brought\r\nupon the stage: he then held the unimportant charge of the district of\r\nMoradabad; but possessed of high talents, he was bought over, by the\r\npromise of the government of Malwa, to further the views of the Sayyids.\r\nSupported by a body of ten thousand Mahrattas, these makers of kings\r\nsoon manifested their displeasure by the deposal of Farrukhsiyar, who\r\nwas left without any support but that of the princes of Amber and Bundi.\r\nYet they would never have abandoned him had he hearkened to their\r\ncounsel to take the field, and trust his cause to them: but, cowardly\r\nand infatuated, he refused to quit the walls of his palace, and threw\r\n[407] himself upon the mercy of his enemies, who made him dismiss the\r\nfaithful Rajputs and “admit a guard of honour of their troops into the\r\ncitadel.”[4.15.3]\r\n\r\n=Murder of Farrukhsīyar, May 16, 1719.=—Farrukhsiyar hoped for security\r\nin the inviolability of the harem—but he found no sanctuary even there:\r\nto use the words of the Mogul memoir, \"night advanced, and day, like the\r\nfallen star of the emperor, sunk in darkness. The gates of the citadel\r\nwere closed upon his friends: the Wazir and Ajit Singh remained within.\r\nThis night was dreadful to the inhabitants of the city; no one knew what\r\nwas passing in the palace, and the troops under the Amiru-l-umara, with\r\nten thousand Mahrattas, remained under arms: morning came, and all hope\r\nwas extinguished by the royal band (_Naubat_) announcing the deposal of\r\nFarrukhsiyar, in the proclamation of Rafiu-d-darajat, his successor.\"\r\nThe interval between the deposal and the death of an Asiatic prince is\r\nshort, and even while the heralds vociferated “long live the king!” to\r\nthe new puppet, the bowstring was on the neck of the contemptible\r\nFarrukhsiyar.\r\n\r\n=Accession of Rafiu-d-darajāt.=—The first act of the new reign (A.D.\r\n1719) was one of conciliation towards Ajit Singh and the Rajputs,\r\nnamely, the abrogation of the _jizya_; and the Sayyids further showed\r\ntheir disposition to attach them by conferring the important office of\r\nDiwan on one of their own faith: Raja Ratan Chand was accordingly\r\ninducted into the ministry in lieu of Inayatu-lla.\r\n\r\n=Accession of Roshan-Akhtar Muhammad Shah, A.D. 1719-48.=—Three phantoms\r\nof royalty flitted across the scene in a few months, till Roshan-Akhtar,\r\nthe eldest son of Bahadur Shah, was [408] enthroned with the title of\r\nMuhammad Shah (A.D. 1720), during whose reign of nearly thirty years the\r\nempire was completely dismembered,[4.15.4] and Mahrattas from the south\r\ndisputed its spoils with the Afghan mountaineers. The haughty demeanour\r\nof the Sayyids disgusted all who acted with them, especially their\r\ncoadjutor the Nizam,[4.15.5] of whose talents, displayed in restoring\r\nMalwa to prosperity, they entertained a dread. It was impossible to\r\ncherish any abstract loyalty for the puppets they established, and\r\ntreason lost its name, when the Nizam declared for independence, which\r\nthe possession of the fortresses of Asir and Burhanpur enabled him to\r\nsecure. The brothers had just cause for alarm. The Rajputs were called\r\nupon for their contingents,[4.15.6] and the princes of Kotah and Narwar\r\ngallantly interposed their own retainers to cut off the Nizam from the\r\nNerbudda, on which occasion the Kotah prince was slain. The independence\r\nof the Nizam led to that of Oudh. Saadat Khan was then but the\r\ncommandant of Bayana, but he entered into the conspiracy to expel the\r\nSayyids, and was one of those who drew lots to assassinate the\r\nAmiru-l-umara. The deed was put into execution on the march to reduce\r\nthe Nizam, when Haidar Khan buried his poniard in the Amir’s\r\nheart.[4.15.7] The emperor then in camp, being thus freed, returned\r\nagainst the Wazir, who instantly set up Ibrahim and marched against his\r\nopponents. The Rajputs wisely remained neutral, and both armies met. The\r\ndecapitation of Ratan Chand was the signal for the battle, which was\r\nobstinate and bloody; the Wazir was made prisoner, and subjected to the\r\nbowstring. For the part Saadat Khan acted in the conspiracy he was\r\nhonoured with the title of Bahadur Jang, and the government of Oudh. The\r\nRajput princes paid their respects to the [409] conqueror, who confirmed\r\nthe repeal of the _jizya_, and as the reward of their neutrality the\r\nRajas of Amber and Jodhpur, Jai Singh and Ajit, were gratified, the\r\nformer with the government of the province of Agra, the last with that\r\nof Gujarat and Ajmer, of which latter fortress he took possession.\r\nGirdhardas[4.15.8] was made governor of Malwa to oppose the Mahrattas,\r\nand the Nizam was invited from his government of Haidarabad to accept\r\nthe office of wazir of the empire.\r\n\r\n=The Policy of Mewār.=—The policy of Mewar was too isolated for the\r\ntimes; her rulers clung to forms and unsubstantial homage, while their\r\nneighbours, with more active virtue, plunged into the tortuous policy of\r\nthe imperial court, and seized every opportunity to enlarge the\r\nboundaries of their States: and while Amber appropriated to herself the\r\nroyal domains almost to the Jumna; while Marwar planted her banner on\r\nthe battlements of Ajmer, dismembered Gujarat, and pushed her clans far\r\ninto the desert, and even to ‘the world’s end’;[4.15.9] Mewar confined\r\nher ambition to the control of her ancient feudatories of Abu, Idar, and\r\nthe petty States which grew out of her, Dungarpur and Banswara. The\r\nmotive for this policy was precisely the same which had cost such\r\nsacrifices in former times; she dreaded amalgamating with the imperial\r\ncourt, and preferred political inferiority to the sacrifice of\r\nprinciple. The internal feuds of her two great clans also operated\r\nagainst her aggrandizement; and while the brave Saktawat, Jeth Singh,\r\nexpelled the Rathor from Idar, and subdued the wild mountaineers even to\r\nKoliwara, the conquest was left incomplete by the jealousy of his rival,\r\nand he was recalled in the midst of his success. From these and other\r\ncauses an important change took place in the internal policy of Mewar,\r\nwhich tended greatly to impair her energies. To this period none of the\r\nvassals had the power to erect places of strength within their domains,\r\nwhich, as already stated, were not fixed, but subject to triennial\r\nchange; their lands were given for subsistence, their native hills were\r\ntheir fortresses, and the frontier strongholds defended their families\r\nin time of invasion. As the Mogul power waned, the general defensive\r\nsystem was [410] abandoned, while the predatory warfare which succeeded\r\ncompelled them to stud their country with castles, in order to shelter\r\ntheir effects from the Mahratta and Pathan, and in later times to\r\nprotect rebels.\r\n\r\nRana Sangram ruled eighteen [twenty-four] years; under him Mewar was\r\nrespected, and the greater portion of her lost territory was regained.\r\nHis selection of Biharidas Pancholi evinced his penetration, for never\r\nhad Mewar a more able or faithful minister, and numerous autograph\r\nletters of all the princes of his time attest his talent and his worth\r\nas the oracle of the period. He retained his office during three reigns:\r\nbut his skill was unable to stem the tide of Mahratta invasion, which\r\ncommenced on the death of Sangram.\r\n\r\n=Anecdotes of Rāna Sangrām Singh II.=—Tradition has preserved many\r\nanecdotes of Sangram, which aid our estimate of Rajput character,\r\nwhether in the capacity of legislators or the more retired sphere of\r\ndomestic manners. They uniformly represent this Rana as a patriarchal\r\nruler, wise, just, and inflexible,[4.15.10] steady in his application to\r\nbusiness, regulating public and private expenditure, and even the\r\nsumptuary laws, which were rigidly adhered to, and on which the people\r\nstill expatiate, giving homely illustrations of the contrast between\r\nthem and the existing profusion. The Chauhan of Kotharia, one of the\r\nhighest class of chieftains, had recommended an addition to the folds of\r\nthe court robe, and as courtesy forbids all personal denial, his wish\r\nwas assented to, and he retired to his estate pluming himself on his\r\nsovereign’s acquiescence. But the Rana, sending for the minister,\r\ncommanded the sequestration of two villages of Kotharia, which speedily\r\nreaching the ears of the chief, he repaired to court, and begged to know\r\nthe fault which had drawn upon him this mark of displeasure. “None,\r\nRaoji; but on a minute calculation I find the revenue of these two\r\nvillages will just cover the expense of the superfluity of garment which\r\nobedience to your wishes will occasion me, and as every iota of my own\r\nincome is appropriated, I had no other mode of innovating on our ancient\r\ncostume than by making you bear the charge attending a compliance with\r\nyour suggestion.” It will readily be believed, that the Chauhan prayed\r\nthe [411] revocation of this edict, and that he was careful for the\r\nfuture of violating the sumptuary laws of his sovereign.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, from lapse of memory or want of consideration, he\r\nbroke the laws he had established, and alienated a village attached to\r\nthe household. Each branch had its appropriate fund, whether for the\r\nkitchen, the wardrobe, the privy purse, the queens; these lands were\r\ncalled _thua_, and each had its officer, or _thuadar_, all of whom were\r\nmade accountable for their trust to the prime minister; it was one of\r\nthese he had alienated. Seated with his chiefs in the _rasora_, or\r\nbanqueting-hall, there was no sugar forthcoming for the curds, which has\r\na place in the dinner _carte_ of all Rajputs, and he chid the\r\nsuperintendent for the omission. “Anndata” (giver of food), replied the\r\nofficer, \"the minister says you have given away the village set apart\r\nfor sugar.\"—“Just,” replied the Rana, and finished his repast without\r\nfurther remark, and without sugar to his curds.\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote will show his inflexibility of character, and his\r\nresistance to that species of interference in state affairs which is the\r\nbane of Asiatic governments. Sangram had recently emancipated himself\r\nfrom the trammels of a tedious minority, during which his mother,\r\naccording to custom, acted a conspicuous part in the guardianship of her\r\nson and the State. The chieftain of Dariawad had his estate confiscated:\r\nbut as the Rana never punished from passion or pardoned from weakness,\r\nnone dared to plead his cause, and he remained proscribed from court\r\nduring two years, when he ventured a petition to the queen-mother\r\nthrough the Bhandarins,[4.15.11] for the reversion of the decree,\r\naccompanied with a note for two lakhs of rupees,[4.15.12] and a liberal\r\ndonation to the fair mediators. It was the daily habit of the Rana to\r\npay his respects to his mother before dinner, and on one of these visits\r\nshe introduced the Ranawat’s request, and begged the restoration of the\r\nestate. It was customary, on the issue of every grant, that eight days\r\nshould elapse from the mandate to the promulgation of the edict, to\r\nwhich eight official seals[4.15.13] were attached; but on the present\r\noccasion the Rana commanded the execution of the deed at once, and to\r\nhave it ere he left the Rawala. On its being brought, he [412] placed it\r\nrespectfully in his mother’s hands, begging her to return the note to\r\nthe Ranawat; having made this sacrifice to duty, he bowed and retired.\r\nThe next day he commanded dinner an hour earlier, without the usual\r\nvisit to the Rawala: all were surprised, but none so much as the\r\nqueen-mother—the day passed—another came—still no visit, and to a\r\nconfidential message, she received a ceremonious reply. Alarmed for the\r\nloss of her son’s affections, she pondered on the cause, but could find\r\nnone, except the grant—she entreated the minister’s interference; he\r\nrespectfully intimated that he was interdicted from the discussion of\r\nState affairs but with his sovereign—she had recourse to other\r\nexpedients, which proving alike fruitless, she became sullen, punished\r\nher damsels without cause, and refused food: Sangram still remained\r\nobdurate. She talked of a pilgrimage to the Ganges, and befitting\r\nequipage and escort were commanded to attend her—the moment of departure\r\nwas at hand, and yet he would not see her. She repaired by Amber on her\r\nroute to Mathura, to worship the Apollo of Vraj,[4.15.14] when the great\r\nRaja Jai Singh (married to the Rana’s sister)[4.15.15] advanced, and\r\nconducted her to his new city of Jaipur, and to evince his respect “put\r\nhis shoulder to the travelling litter or palki,” and promised to return\r\nwith her and be a suppliant to his brother-in-law for the restoration of\r\nhis regard. She made a tour of the sacred places, and on return accepted\r\nthe escort of the Prince of Amber. The laws of hospitality amongst the\r\nRajputs are rigid: the Rana could not refuse to his guest the request\r\nfor which he had left his capital: but averse to owing reconciliation to\r\nexternal intercession, and having done enough for the suppression of\r\nintrigue, he advanced to meet the cortège when within one march of\r\nUdaipur, as if to receive the Amber prince; but proceeding direct to his\r\n[413] mother’s tents, he asked her blessing, and having escorted her to\r\nthe palace, returned to greet and conduct his brother prince; all the\r\nallusion he made to the subject was in the simple but pithy expression,\r\n“family quarrels should be kept in the family.”\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote shows him as the vigilant shepherd watching over the\r\nsafety of his flock. As he sat down to dinner, tidings arrived of an\r\ninvasion of the Malwa Pathans, who had rifled several villages at\r\nMandasor, carrying the inhabitants into captivity. Pushing the platter\r\nfrom him, he ordered his armour, and the _nakkara_ to beat the\r\nassemblage of his chieftains. With all speed a gallant band formed on\r\nthe terrace below, but they prevailed on the Rana to leave the\r\npunishment of the desultory aggression to them, as unworthy of his\r\npersonal interference. They departed: several hours after, the chief of\r\nKanor arrived, having left a sick-bed, and with a tertian come in\r\nobedience to his sovereign’s summons. Vain was his prince’s dissuasion\r\nto keep him back, and he joined the band as they came up with the\r\ninvaders. The foe was defeated and put to flight, but the sick chieftain\r\nfell in the charge, and his son was severely wounded by his side. On the\r\nyoung chief repairing to court he was honoured with a _bira_[4.15.16]\r\nfrom the Rana’s own hand, a distinction which he held to be an ample\r\nreward for his wounds, and testimonial of the worth of his father. The\r\nexistence of such sentiments are the strongest tests of character.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, some parasite had insinuated suspicions against the\r\nchief of the nobles, the Rawat of Salumbar, who had just returned\r\nvictorious in action with the royal forces at Malwa, and had asked\r\npermission to visit his family on his way to court. The Rana spurned the\r\nsuspicion, and to show his reliance on the chief, he dispatched a\r\nmessenger for Salumbar to wait his arrival and summon him to the\r\npresence. He had reached his domain, given leave to his vassals as they\r\npassed their respective abodes, dismounted, and reached the door of the\r\nRawala, when the herald called aloud, “The Rana salutes you, Rawatji,\r\nand commands this letter.” With his hand on the door where his wife and\r\nchildren awaited him, he demanded his horse, and simply leaving his\r\n‘duty for his mother,’ he [414] mounted, with half a dozen attendants,\r\nnor loosed the rein until he reached the capital. It was midnight; his\r\nhouse empty; no servants; no dinner; but his sovereign had foreseen and\r\nprovided, and when his arrival was announced, provender for his cattle,\r\nand vessels of provision prepared in the royal kitchen, were immediately\r\nsent to his abode. Next morning Salumbar attended the court. The Rana\r\nwas unusually gracious, and not only presented him with the usual tokens\r\nof regard, a horse and jewels, but moreover a grant of land. With\r\nsurprise he asked what service he had performed to merit such\r\ndistinction, and from a sentiment becoming the descendant of Chonda\r\nsolemnly refused to accept it; observing, that even if he had lost his\r\nhead, the reward was excessive; but if his prince would admit of his\r\npreferring a request, it would be, that in remembrance of his\r\nsovereign’s favour, when he, or his, in after times, should on the\r\nsummons come from their estate to the capital, the same number of dishes\r\nfrom the royal kitchen should be sent to his abode: it was granted, and\r\nto this day his descendants enjoy the distinction. These anecdotes paint\r\nthe character of Sangram far more forcibly than any laboured effort. His\r\nreign was as honourable to himself as it was beneficial to his country,\r\nin whose defence he had fought eighteen actions; but though his policy\r\nwas too circumscribed, and his country would have benefited more by a\r\nsurrender of some of those antique prejudices which kept her back in the\r\ngeneral scramble for portions of the dilapidated monarchy of the Moguls,\r\nyet he was respected abroad, as he was beloved by his subjects, of whose\r\nwelfare he was ever watchful, and to whose wants ever indulgent. Rana\r\nSangram was the last prince who upheld the dignity of the _gaddi_ of\r\nBappa Rawal; with his death commenced Mahratta ascendancy, and with this\r\nwe shall open the reign of his son and successor.\r\n\r\n=Rāna Jagat Singh II., A.D. 1734-51. Difficulties of Rājput\r\nCombination.=—Jagat Singh II., the eldest of the four sons of Sangram,\r\nsucceeded S. 1790 (A.D. 1734). The commencement of his reign was\r\nsignalized by a revival of the triple alliance formed by Rana Amra, and\r\nbroken by Raja Ajit’s connexion with the Sayyids and the renewal of\r\nmatrimonial ties with the empire, the abjuration whereof was the basis\r\nof the treaty. The present engagement, which included all the minor\r\nstates, was formed at Hurra, a town in Mewar on the Ajmer frontier,\r\nwhere the confederate princes met at the head of their vassals. To\r\ninsure unanimity, the Rana was invested with paramount control, and\r\nheaded the forces which were [415] to take the field after the rains,\r\nalready set in.[4.15.17] Unity of interests was the chief character of\r\nthe engagement, had they adhered to which, not only the independence,\r\nbut the aggrandisement, of Rajasthan, was in their power, and they might\r\nhave alike defied the expiring efforts of Mogul tyranny, and the\r\nParthian-like warfare of the Mahratta. They were indeed the most\r\nformidable power in India at this juncture; but difficult as it had ever\r\nproved to coalesce the Rajputs for mutual preservation, even when a\r\nparamount superiority of power, both temporal and spiritual, belonged to\r\nthe Ranas, so now, since Amber and Marwar had attained an equality with\r\nMewar, it was found still less practicable to prevent the operation of\r\nthe principles of disunion. In fact, a moment’s reflection must discover\r\nthat the component parts of a great feudal federation, such as that\r\ndescribed, must contain too many discordant particles—too many rivalries\r\nand national antipathies—ever cordially to amalgamate. Had it been\r\notherwise, the opportunities were many and splendid for the recovery of\r\nRajput freedom; but though individually enamoured of liberty, the\r\nuniversality of the sentiment prevented its realization: they never\r\nwould submit to the control required to work it out, and this, the best\r\nopportunity which had ever occurred, was lost. A glance at the\r\ndisordered fragments of the throne of Akbar will show the comparative\r\nstrength of the Rajputs.\r\n\r\n=League of Nizamu-l-mulk with Rājputs and Marāthas.=—Nizamu-l-mulk had\r\ncompletely emancipated himself from his allegiance, and signalized his\r\nindependence, by sending the head of the imperial general, who [416]\r\nventured to oppose it, as that of a traitor, to the emperor. He leagued\r\nwith the Rajputs, and instigated Bajirao to plant the Mahratta standard\r\nin Malwa and Gujarat. In defending the former, Dayya Bahadur\r\nfell;[4.15.18] and Jai Singh of Amber, being nominated to the trust,\r\ndelegated it to the invader, and Malwa was lost. The extensive province\r\nof Gujarat soon shared the same fate; for in the vacillating policy of\r\nthe court, the promise of that government to the Rathors had been\r\nbroken, and Abhai Singh, son of Ajit, who had expelled Sarbuland\r\nKhan[4.15.19] after a severe contest, following the example of his\r\nbrother prince of Amber, connived with the invaders, while he added its\r\nmost northern districts to Marwar. In Bengal, Behar, and Orissa,\r\nShujau-d-daula, and his deputy Allahwirdi Khan,[4.15.20] were supreme,\r\nand Safdar Jang[4.15.21] (son of Saadat Khan) was established in Oudh.\r\nThe basest disloyalty marked the rise of this family, which owed\r\neverything to Muhammad Shah. It was Saadat Khan who invited Nadir Shah,\r\nwhose invasion gave the final stab to the empire; and it was his son,\r\nSafdar Jang, who, when commandant of the artillery (_mir-i-atish_),\r\nturned it against his sovereign’s palace, and then conveyed it to Oudh.\r\nOf the Diwans of Bengal we must speak only with reverence; but, whether\r\nthey had any special dispensation, their loyalty to the descendant of\r\nFarrukhsiyar has been very little more distinguished than that of the\r\nsatraps enumerated, though the original tenure of Bengal is still\r\napparent, and the feudal obligation to the suzerain of Delhi manifested,\r\nin the homage of _petite serjanterie_, in transmitting with the annual\r\nfine of relief (one hundred mohars) the spices of the eastern\r\narchipelago. Yet of all those who gloried in the title of _fidwi\r\npadshah-i-ghazi_, the only ‘slave of the victorious king,’ who has been\r\ngenerous to him in the day of his distress, is the Diwan of Bengal,\r\nbetter known as the English East India Company. In the hour of triumph\r\nthey rescued the blind and aged descendants of the illustrious Babur\r\nfrom a state of degradation and penury, and secured to him all the\r\ndignity and comfort which his circumstances could lead him to hope; and\r\nthe present state of his family, contrasted with the thraldom and misery\r\nendured while fortune favoured the Mahratta, is splendid. Yet perhaps\r\nthe most acute stroke of fortune to this fallen monarch was when the\r\nBritish governor of India lent his aid to the descendant of the\r\nrebellious Safdar Jang to mount the throne of Oudh, and to assume, in\r\nlieu of the title of wazir of the empire, that of king. We can [417]\r\nappreciate and commiserate the feeling; for the days of power were yet\r\ntoo recent[4.15.22] for Akbar Sani (the second) to receive such\r\nintelligence without a shock, or without comparing his condition with\r\nhim whose name he bore. It is well to pause upon this page of eastern\r\nhistory, which is full of instruction; since by weighing the abuses of\r\npower, and its inevitable loss through placing a large executive trust\r\nin the hands of those who exercised it without sympathy towards the\r\ngoverned, we may at least retard the day of our decline.\r\n\r\n=Marātha Raids. The Campaign of Nādir Shāh.=—The Mahratta establishments\r\nin Malwa and Gujarat constituted a nucleus for others to form upon, and\r\nlike locusts, they crossed the Nerbudda in swarms; when the Holkars, the\r\nSindhias, the Puars, and other less familiar names, emerged from\r\nobscurity; when the plough[4.15.23] was deserted for the sword, and the\r\ngoat-herd[4.15.24] made a lance of his crook. They devastated, and at\r\nlength settled upon, the lands of the indigenous Rajputs. For a time the\r\nnecessity of unity made them act under one standard, and hence the vast\r\nmasses under the first Bajirao, which bore down all opposition, and\r\nafterwards dispersed themselves over those long-oppressed regions. It\r\nwas in A.D. 1735 that he first crossed the Chambal[4.15.25] and appeared\r\nbefore Delhi, which he blockaded, when his retreat was purchased by the\r\nsurrender of the _chauth_, or fourth of the gross revenues of the\r\nempire. The Nizam, dreading the influence such pusillanimous concession\r\nmight exert upon his rising power, determined to drive the Mahrattas\r\nfrom Malwa, where, if once fixed, they would cut off his communications\r\nwith the north. He accordingly invaded Malwa, defeated Bajirao in a\r\npitched battle, and was only prevented from following it up by Nadir\r\nShah’s advance, facilitated by the Afghans, who, on becoming independent\r\nin Kabul, laid open the frontiers of Hindustan.[4.15.26] In this\r\nemergency, “great hopes were placed on the valour of the Rajputs”; but\r\nthe spirit of devotion in this brave race, by whose aid the Mogul power\r\nwas made and maintained, was irretrievably alienated, and not one of\r\nthose high families, who had throughout been so lavish of their blood in\r\nits defence, would obey the summons to the royal standard, when the fate\r\nof India was decided on the plains of Karnal.[4.15.27] A sense [418] of\r\nindividual danger brought together the great home feudatories, when the\r\nNizam and Saadat Khan (now Wazir) united their forces under the imperial\r\ncommander; but their demoralized levies were no match for the Persian\r\nand the northern mountaineer. The Amiru-l-umara was slain, the Wazir\r\nmade prisoner, and Muhammad Shah and his kingdom were at Nadir’s\r\ndisposal. The disloyalty of the Wazir filled the capital with blood, and\r\nsubjected his sovereign to the condition of a captive. Jealous of the\r\nNizam, whose diplomatic success had obtained him the office of\r\nAmiru-l-umara, he stimulated the avarice of the conqueror by\r\nexaggerating the riches of Delhi, and declared that he alone could\r\nfurnish the ransom negotiated by the Nizam. Nadir’s love of gold\r\noverpowered his principle; the treaty was broken, the keys of Delhi were\r\ndemanded, and its humiliated emperor was led in triumph through the camp\r\nof the conqueror, who, on March 8, A.D. 1739, took possession of the\r\npalace of Timur, and coined money bearing this legend:\r\n\r\n            King over the kings of the world\r\n            Is Nadir, king of kings, and lord of the period.\r\n\r\n=Plunder and Massacre at Delhi.=—The accumulated wealth of India\r\ncontained in the royal treasury, notwithstanding the lavish expenditure\r\nduring the civil wars, and the profuse rewards scattered by each\r\ncompetitor for dominion, was yet sufficient to gratify even avarice\r\nitself, amounting in gold, jewels, and plate to forty millions sterling,\r\nexclusive of equipages of every denomination. But this enormous spoil\r\nonly kindled instead of satiating the appetite of Nadir, and a fine of\r\ntwo millions and a half was exacted, and levied with such unrelenting\r\nrigour and cruelty on the inhabitants, that men of rank and character\r\ncould find no means of escape but by suicide. A rumour of this monster’s\r\ndeath excited an insurrection, in which several Persians were killed.\r\nThe provocation was not lost: the conqueror ascended a mosque,[4.15.28]\r\nand commanded a general massacre, in which thousands were slain. Pillage\r\naccompanied murder; whilst the streets streamed with blood, the city was\r\nfired, and the dead were consumed in the conflagration of their late\r\nhabitations. If a single ray of satisfaction could be felt amidst such a\r\nscene of horror, it must have been when Nadir commanded the minister of\r\nthe wretch who was the author of [419] this atrocity, the infamous\r\nSaadat Khan, to send, on pain of death, an inventory of his own and his\r\nmaster’s wealth; demanding meanwhile the two millions and a half, the\r\noriginal composition settled by the Nizam, from the Wazir alone. Whether\r\nhis ‘coward conscience’ was alarmed at the mischief he had occasioned,\r\nor mortification at discovering that his ambition had ‘o’erleaped\r\nitself,’ and recoiled with vengeance on his own head, tempted the act,\r\nit is impossible to discover, but the guilty Saadat became his own\r\nexecutioner. He swallowed poison;[4.15.29] an example followed by his\r\ndiwan, Raja Majlis Rae, in order to escape the rage of the offended\r\nNadir. By the new treaty, all the western provinces, Kabul, Tatta, Sind,\r\nand Multan, were surrendered and united to Persia, and on the vernal\r\nequinox, Nadir, gorged with spoil, commenced his march from the\r\ndesolated Delhi.[4.15.30] The philosophic comment of the native\r\nhistorian on these events is so just, that we shall transcribe it\r\nverbatim. “The people of Hindustan at this period thought only of\r\npersonal safety and gratification; misery was disregarded by those who\r\nescaped it, and man, centred wholly in self, felt not for his kind. This\r\nselfishness, destructive of public and private virtue, was universal in\r\nHindustan at the invasion of Nadir Shah; nor have the people become more\r\nvirtuous since, and consequently neither more happy nor more\r\nindependent.”\r\n\r\n=Results to the Rājputs.=—At this eventful era in the political history\r\nof India, the Rajput nation had not only maintained their ground amidst\r\nthe convulsions of six centuries under the paramount sway of the\r\nIslamite, but two of the three chief States, Marwar and [420] Amber, had\r\nby policy and valour created substantial States out of petty\r\nprincipalities, junior branches[4.15.31] from which had established\r\ntheir independence, and still enjoy it under treaty with the British\r\nGovernment. Mewar at this juncture was defined by nearly the same\r\nboundaries as when Mahmud of Ghazni invaded her in the tenth century,\r\nthough her influence over many of her tributaries, as Bundi, Abu, Idar,\r\nand Deolia, was destroyed. To the west, the fertile district of Godwar\r\ncarried her beyond her natural barrier, the Aravalli, into the desert;\r\nwhile the Chambal was her limit to the east. The Khari separated her\r\nfrom Ajmer, and to the south she adjoined Malwa. These limits\r\ncomprehended one hundred and thirty miles of latitude and one hundred\r\nand forty of longitude, containing 10,000 towns and villages, with\r\nupwards of a million sterling of revenue, raised from a fertile soil by\r\nan excellent agricultural population, a wealthy mercantile community,\r\nand defended by a devoted vassalage. Such was this little patriarchal\r\nState after the protracted strife which has been related; we shall have\r\nto exhibit her, in less than half a century, on the verge of\r\nannihilation from the predatory inroads of the Mahrattas.\r\n\r\n=The Coming of the Marāthas.=—In order to mark with exactitude the\r\nintroduction of the Mahrattas into Rajasthan, we must revert to the\r\nperiod[4.15.32] when the dastardly intrigues of the advisers of Muhammad\r\nShah surrendered to them as tribute the _chauth_, or fourth of his\r\nrevenues. Whether in the full tide of successful invasion, these\r\nspoilers deemed any other argument than force to be requisite in order\r\nto justify their extortions, they had in this surrender a concession of\r\nwhich the subtle Mahrattas were well capable of availing themselves; and\r\nas the Mogul claimed sovereignty over the whole of Rajasthan, they might\r\nplausibly urge their right of _chauth_, as applicable to all the\r\nterritories subordinate to the empire.\r\n\r\n=The Rājput Coalition.=—The rapidity with which these desultory bands\r\nflew from conquest to conquest appears to have alarmed the Rajputs, and\r\nagain brought about a coalition, which, with the characteristic\r\npeculiarity of all such contracts, was commenced by matrimonial\r\nalliances. On this occasion, Bijai Singh, the heir of Marwar, was\r\naffianced to the Rana’s daughter, who at the same time reconciled the\r\nprinces [421] of Marwar and Amber, whose positions at the court of the\r\nMogul often brought their national jealousies into conflict, as they\r\nalternately took the lead in his councils: for it was rare to find both\r\nin the same line of politics. These matters were arranged at\r\nUdaipur.[4.15.33] But as we have often had occasion to observe, no\r\npublic [422] or general benefit ever resulted from these alliances,\r\nwhich were obstructed by the multitude of petty jealousies inseparable\r\nfrom clanship; even while this treaty was in discussion, the fruit of\r\nthe triple league formed against the tyranny of Aurangzeb was about to\r\nshow its baneful influence, as will presently appear.\r\n\r\n=Bājirāo visits Mewār. Negotiations with the Marāthas.=—When Malwa was\r\nacquired by the Mahrattas, followed by the cession of the _chauth_,\r\ntheir leader, Bajirao, repaired to Mewar, where his visit created great\r\nalarm.[4.15.34] The Rana desired to avoid a personal interview, and sent\r\nas his ambassadors [423], the chief of Salumbar and his prime minister,\r\nBiharidas. Long discussions followed as to the mode of Bajirao’s\r\nreception, which was settled to be on the same footing as the Raja of\r\nBanera,[4.15.35] and that he should be seated in front of the throne. A\r\ntreaty followed, stipulating an annual tribute, which remained in force\r\nduring ten years,[4.15.36] when grasping at the whole they despised a\r\npart, and the treaty became a nullity.[4.15.37] The dissensions which\r\narose soon after, in consequence of the Rajput engagements, afforded the\r\nopportunity sought for to mix in their internal concerns.\r\n\r\n=Right of Primogeniture.=—It may be recollected that in the family\r\nengagements formed by Rana Amra there was an obligation to invest the\r\nissue of such marriage with the rights of primogeniture; and the death\r\nof Sawai Jai Singh[4.15.38] of Amber, two years after Nadir’s invasion,\r\nbrought that stipulation into effect. His eldest son, Isari Singh, was\r\nproclaimed Raja, but a strong party supported Madho Singh, the Rana’s\r\nnephew, and the stipulated, against the natural order of succession. We\r\nare [424] left in doubt as to the real designs of Jai Singh in\r\nmaintaining his guarantee, which was doubtless inconvenient; but that\r\nMadho Singh was not brought up to the expectation is evident, from his\r\nholding a fief of the Rana Sangram, who appropriated the domain of\r\nRampura for his support, subject to the service of one thousand horse\r\nand two thousand foot, formally sanctioned by his father, who allowed\r\nthe transfer of his services. On the other hand, the letter of\r\npermission entitles him _Kshema_, ‘prosperous,’ an epithet only applied\r\nto the heir-apparent of Jaipur. Five years, however, elapsed before any\r\nextraordinary exertions were made to annul the rights of Isari Singh,\r\nwho led his vassals to the Sutlej in order to oppose the first invasion\r\nof the Duranis.[4.15.39] It would be tedious to give even an epitome of\r\nthe intrigues for the development of this object, which properly belong\r\nto the annals of Amber, and whence resulted many of the troubles of\r\nRajputana. The Rana took the field with his nephew, and was met by Isari\r\nSingh,[4.15.40] supported by the Mahrattas; but the Sesodias did not\r\nevince in the battle of Rajmahall that gallantry which must have its\r\nsource in moral strength: they were defeated and fled. The Rana vented\r\nhis indignation in a galling sarcasm; he gave the sword of state to a\r\ncommon courtesan to carry in procession, observing “it was a woman’s\r\nweapon in these degenerate times”: a remark the degrading severity of\r\nwhich made a lasting impression in the decline of Mewar. Elated with\r\nthis success, Isari Singh carried his resentments and his auxiliaries,\r\nunder Sindhia, against the Haras of Kotah and Bundi, who supported the\r\ncause of his antagonist. Kotah stood a siege and was gallantly defended,\r\nand Sindhia (Apaji) lost an arm:[4.15.41] on this occasion both the\r\nStates suffered a diminution of territory, and were subjected to\r\ntribute. The Rana, following the example of the Kachhwahas, called in as\r\nauxiliary Malhar Rao Holkar, and engaged to pay sixty-four lakhs of\r\nrupees (£800,000) on the deposal of Isari Singh. To avoid degradation\r\nthis unfortunate prince resolved on suicide, and a dose of poison gave\r\nMadho Singh the _gaddi_, Holkar his bribe, and the Mahrattas a firm hold\r\nupon Rajasthan. Such was the cause of Rajput abasement; the moral force\r\nof the vassals was lost in a contest unjust in all its associations, and\r\nfrom this period we have only the degrading spectacle of civil strife\r\nand predatory spoliation till the existing treaty of A.D. 1817 [425].\r\n\r\n=Death of Rāna Jagat Singh II., A.D. 1751.=—In S. 1808 (A.D. 1752) Rana\r\nJagat Singh died. Addicted to pleasure, his habits of levity and\r\nprofusion totally unfitted him for the task of governing his country at\r\nsuch a juncture; he considered his elephant fights[4.15.42] of more\r\nimportance than keeping down the Mahrattas. Like all his family, he\r\npatronized the arts, greatly enlarged the palace, and expended £250,000\r\nin embellishing the islets of the Pichola. The villas scattered over the\r\nvalley were all erected by him, and many of those festivals devoted to\r\nidleness and dissipation, and now firmly rooted at Udaipur, were\r\ninstituted by Jagat Singh II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 16\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rāna Partāp Singh II., A.D. 1751-54.=—Partap II. succeeded in A.D.\r\n1752. Of the history of this prince, who renewed the most illustrious\r\nname in the annals of Mewar, there is nothing to record beyond the fact,\r\nthat the three years he occupied the throne were marked by so many\r\nMahratta invasions[4.16.1] and war contributions. By a daughter of Raja\r\nJai Singh of Amber he had a son, who succeeded him.\r\n\r\n=Rāna Rāj Singh II., A.D. 1754-61.=—Rana Raj Singh II. was as little\r\nentitled to the name he bore as his predecessor. During the seven years\r\nhe held the dignity at least seven shoals of the Southrons overran\r\nMewar,[4.16.2] and so exhausted this country, that the Rana was\r\ncompelled to ask pecuniary aid from the Brahman collector of the\r\ntribute, to enable him to marry the Rathor chieftain’s daughter. On his\r\ndeath the order of succession retrograded, devolving on his uncle [426],\r\n\r\n=Rāna Arsi Singh II., A.D. 1761-73.=—Rana Arsi, in S. 1818, A.D. 1762.\r\nThe levity of Jagat Singh, the inexperience of his successors Partap and\r\nRaj Singh, with the ungovernable temper of Rana Arsi, and the\r\ncircumstances under which he succeeded to power, introduced a train of\r\ndisorders which proved fatal to Mewar. Until this period not a foot of\r\nterritory had been alienated. The wisdom of the Pancholi ministers, and\r\nthe high respect paid by the organ of the Satara government, for a while\r\npreserved its integrity; but when the country was divided by factions,\r\nand the Mahrattas, ceasing to be a federate body, prowled in search of\r\nprey under leaders, each having an interest of his own, they formed\r\npolitical combinations to suit the ephemeral purposes of the former, but\r\nfrom which they alone reaped advantage. An attempt to depose Partap and\r\nset up his uncle Nathji introduced a series of rebellions, and\r\nconstituted Malhar Rao Holkar, who had already become master of a\r\nconsiderable portion of the domain of Mewar, the umpire in their family\r\ndisputes.\r\n\r\n=Malhār Rāo Holkar invades Mewār. Famine, A.D. 1764.=—The ties of blood\r\nor of princely gratitude are feeble bonds if political expediency\r\ndemands their dissolution; and Madho Singh, when firmly established on\r\nthe throne of Amber, repaid the immense sacrifices by which the Rana had\r\neffected it by assigning his fief of Rampura, which he had not a shadow\r\nof right to alienate, to Holkar: this was the first limb severed from\r\nMewar.[4.16.3] Holkar had also become the assignee of the tribute\r\nimposed by Bajirao, but from which the Rana justly deemed himself\r\nexempt, when the terms of all further encroachment in Mewar were set at\r\nnought. On the plea of recovering these arrears, and the rent of some\r\ndistricts[4.16.4] on the Chambal, Malhar, after many threatening\r\nletters, invaded Mewar, and his threats of occupying the capital were\r\nonly checked by draining their exhausted resources of six hundred\r\nthousand pounds.[4.16.5] In the same year[4.16.6] a famine afflicted\r\nthem, when flour and tamarinds were equal in value, and were sold at the\r\nrate of a rupee for one pound and a half. Four years subsequent to this,\r\ncivil war broke out and continued to influence all posterior\r\nproceedings, rendering [427] the inhabitants of this unhappy country a\r\nprey to every invader until 1817, when they tasted repose under British\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n=Civil War in Mewār. Revolt of Ratan Singh.=—The real cause of this\r\nrebellion must ever remain a secret: for while some regard it as a\r\npatriotic effort on the part of the people to redeem themselves from\r\nforeign domination, others discover its motive in the selfishness of the\r\nhostile clans, who supported or opposed the succession of Rana Arsi.\r\nThis prince is accused of having unfairly acquired the crown, by the\r\nremoval of his nephew Raj Singh; but though the traditional anecdotes of\r\nthe period furnish strong grounds of suspicion, there is nothing which\r\naffords a direct confirmation of the crime. It is, however, a public\r\nmisfortune when the line of succession retrogrades in Mewar: Arsi had no\r\nright to expect the inheritance he obtained, having long held a seat\r\nbelow the sixteen chief nobles; and as one of the ‘infants’ (_babas_) he\r\nwas incorporated with the second class of nobles with an appanage of\r\nonly £3000 per annum. His defects of character had been too closely\r\ncontemplated by his compeers, and had kindled too many enmities, to\r\njustify expectation that the adventitious dignity he had attained would\r\nsucceed in obliterating the memory of them; and past familiarity alone\r\ndestroyed the respect which was exacted by sudden greatness. His\r\ninsolent demeanour estranged the first of the home nobility, the Sadri\r\nchieftain,[4.16.7] whose ancestor at Haldighat acquired a claim to the\r\nperpetual gratitude of the Sesodias, while to an unfeeling pun on a\r\npersonal defect of Jaswant Singh of Deogarh is attributed the hatred and\r\nrevenge of this powerful branch of the Chondawats. These chiefs formed a\r\nparty which eventually entrained many of lesser note to depose their\r\nsovereign, and immediately set up a youth called Ratna Singh, declared\r\nto be the posthumous son of the last Rana by the daughter of the chief\r\nof Gogunda, though to this hour disputes run high as to whether he was\r\nreally the son of Raj Singh, or merely the puppet [428] of a faction. Be\r\nthe fact as it may, he was made a rallying point for the disaffected,\r\nwho soon comprehended the greater portion of the nobles, while out of\r\nthe ‘sixteen’ greater chiefs five[4.16.8] only withstood the defection:\r\nof these, Salumbar, the hereditary premier, at first espoused, but soon\r\nabandoned, the cause of the Pretender; not from the principle of loyalty\r\nwhich his descendants take credit for, but from finding the superiority\r\nof intellect of the heads of the rebellion[4.16.9] (which now counted\r\nthe rival Saktawats) too powerful for the supremacy he desired. Basant\r\nPal, of the Depra tribe, was invested with the office of Pardhan to the\r\nPretender. The ancestor of this man accompanied Samarsi in the twelfth\r\ncentury from Delhi, where he held a high office in the household of\r\nPrithiraj, the last emperor of the Hindus, and it is a distinguished\r\nproof of the hereditary quality of official dignity to find his\r\ndescendant, after the lapse of centuries, still holding office with the\r\nnominal title of Pardhan. The Futuri[4.16.10] (by which name the court\r\nstill designates the Pretender) took post with his faction in\r\nKumbhalmer; where he was formally installed, and whence he promulgated\r\nhis decrees as Rana of Mewar. With that heedlessness of consequences and\r\nthe political debasement which are invariable concomitants of civil\r\ndissension, they had the meanness to invite Sindhia to their aid, with a\r\npromise of a reward of more than one million sterling[4.16.11] on the\r\ndethronement of Arsi.\r\n\r\n=Zālim Singh of Kotah.=—This contest first brought into notice one of\r\nthe most celebrated Rajput chiefs of India, Zalim Singh of Kotah, who\r\nwas destined to fill a distinguished part in the annals of Rajasthan,\r\nbut more especially in Mewar, where his political sagacity first\r\ndeveloped itself. Though this is not the proper place to delineate his\r\nhistory, which will occupy a subsequent portion of the work, it is\r\nimpossible to trace the events with which he was so closely connected\r\nwithout adverting slightly to the part he acted in these scenes. The\r\nattack on Kotah, of which his father was military governor (during the\r\nstruggle to place Madho Singh on the throne of Amber), by Isari Singh,\r\nin conjunction with Sindhia, was the first avenue to his distinguished\r\ncareer, leading to an acquaintance with the Mahratta chiefs, which\r\nlinked him with their policy for more than half a century [429]. Zalim\r\nhaving lost his prince’s favour, whose path in love he had dared to\r\ncross, repaired, on his banishment from Kotah, to the Rana, who,\r\nobserving his talents, enrolled him amongst his chiefs, and conferred on\r\nhim, with the title of Raj Rana, the lands of Chitarkhera for his\r\nsupport. By his advice the Mahratta leaders, Raghu Paigawala and Daula\r\nMiyan, with their bands, were called in by the Rana, who, setting aside\r\nthe ancient Pancholi ministry, gave the seals of office to Agarji Mehta.\r\nAt this period (S. 1824, A.D. 1768), Mahadaji Sindhia was at Ujjain,\r\nwhither the conflicting parties hastened, each desirous of obtaining the\r\nchieftain’s support. But the Pretender’s proposals had been already\r\nentertained, and he was then encamped with Sindhia on the banks of the\r\nSipra.[4.16.12]\r\n\r\n=Battle at the Sipra, and Siege of Udaipur, A.D. 1769.=—The Rana’s\r\nforce, conducted by the chief of Salumbar, the Rajas of Shahpura and\r\nBanera, with Zalim Singh and the Mahratta auxiliaries, did not hesitate\r\nto attack the combined camp, and for a moment they were victorious,\r\ndriving Mahadaji and the Pretender from the field, with great loss, to\r\nthe gates of Ujjain. Here, however, they rallied, and being joined by a\r\nfresh body of troops, the battle was renewed with great disadvantage to\r\nthe Rajputs, who, deeming the day theirs, had broken and dispersed to\r\nplunder. The chiefs of Salumbar, Shahpura, and Banera were slain, and\r\nthe auxiliary Daula Miyan, Raja Man (ex-prince of Narwar), and Raj\r\nKalyan, the heir of Sadri, severely wounded. Zalim Singh had his horse\r\nkilled under him, and being left wounded on the field, was made\r\nprisoner, but hospitably treated by Trimbak Rao, father to the\r\ncelebrated Ambaji. The discomfited troops retreated to Udaipur while the\r\nPretender’s party remained with Sindhia, inciting him to invest that\r\ncapital and place Ratna on the throne. Some time, however, elapsed\r\nbefore he could carry this design into execution; when at the head of a\r\nlarge force the Mahratta chief gained the passes and besieged the city.\r\nThe Rana’s cause now appeared hopeless. Bhim Singh of Salumbar, uncle\r\nand successor to the chief slain at Ujjain, with the Rathor chief of\r\nBadnor (descendant of Jaimall), were the only nobles of high rank who\r\ndefended their prince and capital in this emergency; but the energies of\r\nan individual saved both.\r\n\r\n=Amar Chand, Minister of Mewār.=—Amra Chand Barwa, of the mercantile\r\nclass, had held office in the preceding reigns, when his influence\r\nretarded the progress of evils which no human means could avert. He was\r\nnow displaced, and little solicitous of recovering his [430] transient\r\npower, amidst hourly increasing difficulties, with a stubborn and\r\nunpopular prince, a divided aristocracy, and an impoverished country. He\r\nwas aware also of his own imperious temper, which was as ungovernable as\r\nhis sovereign’s, and which experienced no check from the minor Partap,\r\nwho regarded him as his father. During the ten years he had been out of\r\noffice, mercenaries of Sind had been entertained and established on the\r\nforfeited lands of the clans, perpetuating discontent and stifling every\r\nlatent spark of patriotism. Even those who did not join the Pretender\r\nremained sullenly at their castles, and thus all confidence was\r\nannihilated. A casual incident brought Amra forward at this critical\r\njuncture. Udaipur had neither ditch nor walls equal to its defence. Arsi\r\nwas engaged in fortifying Eklinggarh, a lofty hill south of the\r\ncity,[4.16.13] which it commanded, and attempting to place thereon an\r\nenormous piece of ordnance, but it baffled their mechanical skill to get\r\nit over the scraggy ascent. Amra happened to be present when the Rana\r\narrived to inspect the proceedings. Excuses were made to avert his\r\ndispleasure, when turning to the ex-minister, he inquired what time and\r\nexpense ought to attend the completion of such an undertaking. The reply\r\nwas, “A few rations of grain and some days”: and he offered to\r\naccomplish the task, on condition that his orders should be supreme in\r\nthe valley during its performance. He collected the whole working\r\npopulation, cut a road, and in a few days gave the Rana a salute from\r\nEklinggarh. The foster-brother of the Rana had succeeded the Jhala\r\nchieftain, Raghu Deo, in the ministerial functions. The city was now\r\nclosely invested on every side but the west, where communications were\r\nstill kept open by the lake, across which the faithful mountaineers of\r\nthe Aravalli, who in similar dangers never failed, supplied them with\r\nprovisions. All defence rested on the fidelity of the mercenary Sindis,\r\nand they were at this very moment insolent in their clamours for arrears\r\nof pay. Nor were the indecisive measures daily passing before their eyes\r\ncalculated to augment their respect, or stimulate their courage. Not\r\nsatisfied with demands, they had the audacity to seize the Rana by the\r\nskirt of his robe as he entered the palace, which was torn in the effort\r\nto detain him. The haughtiness of his temper gave way to this\r\nhumiliating proof of the hopelessness of his condition; and while the\r\nDhabhai (foster-brother) counselled escape by water to the mountains,\r\nwhence he might gain Mandalgarh, the Salumbar chief confessed his\r\ninability to offer any advice [431] save that of recourse to Amra Chand.\r\nHe was summoned, and the uncontrolled charge of their desperate affairs\r\noffered to his guidance. He replied that it was a task of which no man\r\ncould be covetous, more especially himself, whose administration had\r\nformerly been marked by the banishment of corruption and disorder, for\r\nthat he must now call in the aid of these vices, and assimilate the\r\nmeans to the times. “You know also,” he added, \"my defect of temper,\r\nwhich admits of no control. Wherever I am, I must be absolute—no secret\r\nadvisers, no counteraction of measures. With finances ruined, troops\r\nmutinous, provisions expended, if you desire me to act, swear that no\r\norder, whatever its purport, shall be countermanded, and I may try what\r\ncan be done: but recollect, Amra ‘the just’ will be the unjust, and\r\nreverse his former character.\" The Rana pledged himself by the patron\r\ndeity to comply with all his demands, adding this forcible expression:\r\n\"Should you even send to the queen’s apartment and demand her necklace\r\nor _nathna_,[4.16.14] it shall be granted.\" The advice of the Dhabhai\r\nencountered the full flood of Amra’s wrath. “The counsel is such as\r\nmight be expected from your condition. What will preserve your prince at\r\nMandalgarh if he flies from Udaipur, and what hidden resources have you\r\nthere for your support? The project would suit you, who might resume\r\nyour original occupation of tending buffaloes and selling milk, more\r\nadapted to your birth and understanding than state affairs; but these\r\npursuits your prince has yet to learn.” The Rana and his chiefs bent\r\ntheir heads at the bold bearing of Amra. Descending to the terrace,\r\nwhere the Sindi leaders and their bands were assembled, he commanded\r\nthem to follow him, exclaiming, “Look to me for your arrears, and as for\r\nyour services, it will be my fault if you fail.” The mutineers, who had\r\njust insulted their sovereign, rose without reply, and in a body left\r\nthe palace with Amra, who calculated their arrears and promised payment\r\nthe next day. Meanwhile he commanded the bhandars (repositories) to be\r\nbroken open, as the keeper of each fled when the keys of their trust\r\nwere demanded. All the gold and silver, whether in bullion or in\r\nvessels, were converted into money—jewels were pledged—the troops paid\r\nand satisfied, ammunition and provisions laid in—a fresh stimulus\r\nsupplied, the enemy held at defiance, and the siege prolonged during six\r\nmonths [432].\r\n\r\nThe Pretender’s party had extended their influence over a great part of\r\nthe crown domain, even to the valley of Udaipur; but unable to fulfil\r\nthe stipulation to Sindhia, the baffled Mahratta, to whom time was\r\ntreasure, negotiated with Amra to raise the siege, and abandon the\r\nPretender on the payment of seventy lakhs. But scarcely was the treaty\r\nsigned, when the reported disposition of the auxiliaries, and the\r\nplunder expected on a successful assault, excited his avarice and made\r\nhim break his faith, and twenty lakhs additional were imposed. Amra tore\r\nup the treaty, and sent back the fragments to the faithless Mahratta\r\nwith defiance. His spirit increased with his difficulties, and he\r\ninfused his gallantry into the hearts of the most despairing. Assembling\r\nthe Sindis and the home-clans who were yet true to their prince, he\r\nexplained to them the transaction, and addressed them in that language\r\nwhich speaks to the souls of all mankind, and to give due weight to his\r\nexhortation, he distributed amongst the most deserving, many articles of\r\ncumbrous ornament lying useless in the treasury. The stores of grain in\r\nthe city and neighbourhood, whether public or private, were collected\r\nand sent to the market, and it was proclaimed by beat of drum that every\r\nfighting man should have six months’ provision on application. Hitherto\r\ngrain had been selling at little more than a pound for the rupee, and\r\nthese unexpected resources were matter of universal surprise, more\r\nespecially to the besiegers.[4.16.15] The Sindis, having no longer cause\r\nfor discontent, caught the spirit of the brave Amra, and went in a body\r\nto the palace to swear in public never to abandon the Rana, whom their\r\nleader, Adil Beg,[4.16.16] thus addressed: “We have long eaten your salt\r\nand received numerous favours from your house, and we now come to swear\r\nnever to abandon you. Udaipur is our home, and we will fall with it. We\r\ndemand no further pay, and when our grain is exhausted, we will feed on\r\nthe beasts, and when these fail we will thin the ranks of the Southrons\r\nand die sword in hand.” Such were the sentiments that Amra had inspired,\r\nthe expression of which extorted tears from the Rana—a sight so unusual\r\nwith this stern prince, as to raise frantic shouts from the Sindis and\r\nhis Rajputs. The enthusiasm spread and was announced to Sindhia with all\r\nits circumstances by a general discharge of cannon on his advanced [433]\r\nposts. Apprehensive of some desperate display of Rajput valour, the wary\r\nMahratta made overtures for a renewal of the negotiation. It was now\r\nAmra’s turn to triumph, and he replied that he must deduct from the\r\noriginal terms the expense they had incurred in sustaining another six\r\nmonths’ siege. Thus outwitted, Sindhia was compelled to accept sixty\r\nlakhs, and three-and-a-half for official expenses.[4.16.17]\r\n\r\n=Cessions made to Sindhia.=—Thirty-three lakhs in jewels and specie,\r\ngold and silver plate, and assignments on the chiefs, were immediately\r\nmade over to Sindhia, and lands mortgaged for the liquidation of the\r\nremainder. For this object the districts of Jawad, Jiran, Nimach, and\r\nMorwan were set aside to be superintended by joint officers of both\r\ngovernments, with an annual investigation of accounts. From S. 1825 to\r\nS. 1831 [A.D. 1768-74] no infringement took place of this arrangement;\r\nbut in the latter year Sindhia dismissed the Rana’s officers from the\r\nmanagement, and refused all further settlement; and with the exception\r\nof a temporary occupation on Sindhia’s reverse of fortune in S. 1851\r\n[A.D. 1794], these rich districts have remained severed from Mewar. In\r\nS. 1831 [A.D. 1774] the great officers of the Mahratta federation began\r\nto shake off the trammels of the Peshwa’s authority; and Sindhia\r\nretained for the State of which he was the founder, all these lands\r\nexcept Morwan, which was made over to Holkar, who the year after the\r\ntransaction demanded of the Rana the surrender of the district of\r\nNimbahera, threatening, in the event of non-compliance, to repeat the\r\npart his predatory coadjutor Sindhia had just performed. The cession was\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\nThus terminated, in S. 1826 [A.D. 1769], the siege of Udaipur, with the\r\ndislocation of these fine districts from Mewar. But let it be remembered\r\nthat they were only mortgaged:[4.16.18] and although the continued\r\ndegradation of the country from the same causes has prevented their\r\nredemption, the claim to them has never been abandoned. Their recovery\r\nwas stipulated by the ambassadors of the Rana in the treaty of A.D. 1817\r\nwith the British Government; but our total ignorance of the past\r\ntransactions of these countries, added to our amicable relations with\r\nSindhia [434], prevented any pledge of the reunion of these districts;\r\nand it must ever be deeply lamented that, when the treacherous and\r\nhostile conduct of Sindhia gave a noble opportunity for their\r\nrestoration, it was lost, from policy difficult to understand, and which\r\nmust be subject to the animadversions of future historians of that\r\nimportant period in the history of India. It yet remains for the wisdom\r\nof the British Government to decide whether half a century’s abeyance,\r\nand the inability to redeem them by the sword, render the claim a dead\r\nletter. At all events, the facts here recorded from a multiplicity of\r\npublic documents, and corroborated by living actors[4.16.19] in the\r\nscene, may be useful at some future day, when expedience may admit of\r\ntheir being reannexed to Mewar.\r\n\r\n=Ratan Singh defeated.=—Amra’s defence of the capital, and the retreat\r\nof the Mahrattas, was a deathblow to the hopes of the Pretender, who had\r\nobtained not only many of the strongholds, but a footing in the valley\r\nof the capital. Rajnagar, Raepur, and Untala were rapidly recovered;\r\nmany of the nobles returned to the Rana and to their allegiance; and\r\nRatna was left in Kumbhalmer with the Depra minister, and but three of\r\nthe sixteen principal nobles, namely Deogarh, Bhindir, and Amet. These\r\ncontentions lasted till S. 1831 [A.D. 1774], when the chiefs above named\r\nalso abandoned him, but not until their rebellion had cost the feather\r\nin the crown of Mewar. The rich province of Godwar, the most fruitful of\r\nall her possessions, and containing the most loyal of her vassalage, the\r\nRanawats, Rathors, and Solankis, was nearly all held on tenure of feudal\r\nservice, and furnished three thousand horse besides foot, a greater\r\nnumber than the aggregate of the Chondawats. This district, which was\r\nwon with the title of Rana from the Parihara prince of Mandor, before\r\nJodhpur was built, and whose northern boundary was confirmed by the\r\nblood of the Chondawat chief in the reign of Jodha, was confided by the\r\nRana to the care of Raja Bijai Singh of Jodhpur, to prevent its\r\nresources being available to the Pretender, whose residence, Kumbhalmer,\r\ncommanded the approach to it: and the original treaty yet exists in\r\nwhich the prince of Marwar binds himself to provide and support a body\r\nof three thousand men for the Rana’s service, from its revenues.\r\n\r\n=Assassination of Rāna Ari Singh, A.D. 1773.=—This province might have\r\nbeen recovered; but the evil genius of Arsi Rana at this time led him to\r\nBundi to [435] hunt at the spring festival (the Aheria), with the Hara\r\nprince, in spite of the prophetic warning of the suttee, who from the\r\nfuneral pile denounced a practice which had already thrice proved fatal\r\nto the princes of Mewar.[4.16.20] Rana Arsi fell by the hand of the\r\nBundi prince, and Godwar, withheld from his minor successor, has since\r\nremained severed. The Bundi heir, who perpetrated this atrocious\r\nassassination, was said to be prompted by the Mewar nobles, who detested\r\ntheir sovereign, and with whom, since the late events, it was impossible\r\nthey could ever unite in confidence. Implacable in his disposition, he\r\nbrooded over injuries, calmly awaiting the moment to avenge them. A\r\nsingle instance will suffice to evince this, as well as the infatuation\r\nof Rajput devotion. The Salumbar chief, whose predecessor had fallen in\r\nsupport of the Rana’s cause at the battle of Ujjain, having incurred his\r\nsuspicions, the Rana commanded him to eat the _pan_ (betel leaf)\r\npresented on taking leave. Startled at so unusual an order, he\r\nremonstrated, but in vain; and with the conviction that it contained his\r\ndeath-warrant he obeyed, observing to the tyrant, “My compliance will\r\ncost you and your family dear”: words fulfilled with fearful accuracy,\r\nfor to this and similar acts is ascribed the murder of Arsi, and the\r\ncompletion of the ruin of the country. A colour of pretext was afforded\r\nto the Bundi chief in a boundary dispute regarding a patch of land\r\nyielding only a few good mangoes; but, even admitting this as a\r\npalliative, it could not justify the inhospitable act, which in the mode\r\nof execution added cowardice to barbarity: for while both were pursuing\r\nthe boar, the Bundi heir drove his lance through the heart of the Rana.\r\nThe assassin fell a victim to remorse, the deed being not only\r\ndisclaimed, but severely reprobated by his father, and all the Hara\r\ntribe. A cenotaph still stands on the site of the murder, where the body\r\nof Arsi was consumed, and the feud between the houses remains\r\nunappeased.\r\n\r\n=Rāna Hamīr Singh II., A.D. 1773-78.=—Rana Arsi left two sons, Hamir and\r\nBhim Singh. The former, a name of celebrity in their annals, succeeded\r\nin S. 1828 (A.D. 1772) to the little enviable title of Rana. With an\r\nambitious mother, determined to control affairs during his minority, a\r\nstate pronounced by the bard peculiarly dangerous to a Rajput\r\ndynasty,—and the vengeful competition of the Salumbar chief (successor\r\nto the murdered noble), who was equally resolved to take the lead,\r\ncombined with an unextinguishable enmity to the Saktawats, who supported\r\nthe policy of the queen-mother [436], the demoralization of Mewar was\r\ncomplete: her fields were deluged with blood, and her soil was the prey\r\nof every paltry marauder.\r\n\r\n=Outbreak of the Sindis.=—The mercenary Sindis, who, won by the\r\nenthusiasm of Amra, had for a moment assumed the garb of fidelity, threw\r\nit off at their prince’s death, taking possession of the capital, which\r\nit will be remembered had been committed to the charge of the Salumbar\r\nchief, whom they confined and were about to subject to the torture of\r\nthe hot iron[4.16.21] to extort their arrears of pay, when he was\r\nrescued from the indignity by the unlooked-for return of Amra from\r\nBundi. This faithful minister determined to establish the rights of the\r\ninfant prince against all other claimants for power. But he knew\r\nmankind, and had attained, what is still more difficult, the knowledge\r\nof himself. Aware that his resolution to maintain his post at all\r\nhazards, and against every competitor, would incur the imputation of\r\nself-interest, he, like our own Wolsey, though from far different\r\nmotives, made an inventory of his wealth, in gold, jewels, and plate,\r\neven to his wardrobe, and sent the whole in trays to the queen-mother.\r\nSuspicion was shamed and resentment disarmed by this proceeding; and to\r\nrepeated entreaties that he would receive it back he was inflexible,\r\nwith the exception of articles of apparel that had already been in use.\r\nThis imperious woman was a daughter of Gogunda. She possessed\r\nconsiderable talents, but was ruled by an artful _intrigante_, who, in\r\nher turn, was governed by a young _homme d’affaires_, then holding an\r\ninferior office, but who subsequently acted a conspicuous part; slew and\r\nwas slain, like almost all who entered into the politics of this\r\ntempestuous period. The queen-mother, now supported by the Chondawats,\r\nopposed the minister, who maintained himself by aid of the Sindis, kept\r\nthe Mahrattas from the capital, and protected the crown land; but the\r\nungrateful return made to his long-tried fidelity rendered his temper\r\nungovernable. Rampiyari[4.16.22] (such the name of the _intrigante_)\r\nrepaired on one occasion to the office of the minister, and in the name\r\nof the regent queen reviled him for some supposed omission. Amra, losing\r\nall temper at this intrusion, applied to the fair abigail the coarsest\r\nepithets used to her sex, bidding her begone as a Kothi ki Rand (a\r\nphrase we shall not translate), which was reported with exaggeration to\r\nthe queen, who threw herself into a litter and set off to the Salumbar\r\nchief. Amra, anticipating [437] an explosion, met the cavalcade in the\r\nstreet, and enjoined her instant return to the palace. Who dared\r\ndisobey? Arrived at the door of the Rawala, he made his obeisance, and\r\ntold her it was a disgrace to the memory of her lord that she should\r\nquit the palace under any pretext; that even the potter’s wife did not\r\ngo abroad for six months after her husband’s death, while she, setting\r\ndecorum at defiance, had scarcely permitted the period of mourning to\r\nelapse. He concluded by saying he had a duty to perform, and that he\r\nwould perform it in spite of all obstacles, in which, as it involved her\r\nown and her children’s welfare, she ought to cooperate, instead of\r\nthwarting him. But Baiji Raj (the royal mother) was young, artful, and\r\nambitious, and persevered in her hostility till the demise of this\r\nuncompromising minister shortly after, surmised to be caused by poison.\r\nHis death yielded a flattering comment on his life: he left not funds\r\nsufficient to cover the funeral expenses, and is, and will probably\r\ncontinue, the sole instance on record in Indian history of a minister\r\nhaving his obsequies defrayed by subscription among his fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nThe man who thus lived and thus died would have done honour to any, even\r\nthe most civilized, country, where the highest incentives to public\r\nvirtue exist. What, therefore, does not his memory merit, when amongst a\r\npeople who, through long oppression, were likely to hold such feelings\r\nin little estimation, he pursued its dictates from principle alone, his\r\nsole reward that which the world could not bestow, the applause of the\r\nmonitor within? But they greatly err who, in the application of their\r\nown overweening standard of merit, imagine there is no public opinion in\r\nthese countries; for recollections of actions like this (of which but a\r\nsmall portion is related) they yet love to descant upon, and an act of\r\nvigour and integrity is still designated Amrachanda;[4.16.23] evincing\r\nthat if virtue has few imitators in this country, she is not without\r\nardent admirers.\r\n\r\n=Revolt of the Chief of Begūn.=—In S. 1831 (A.D. 1775) the rebellion of\r\nthe Begun chief, head of a grand division of the Chondawats, the\r\nMeghawat, obliged the queen-mother to call upon Sindhia for his\r\nreduction, who recovered the crown lands he had usurped, and imposed on\r\nthis refractory noble a fine of twelve lakhs of rupees, or £100,000\r\n[438] sterling.[4.16.24] But instead of confining himself to punishing\r\nthe guilty, and restoring the lands to the young Rana, he inducted his\r\nown son-in-law Berji Tap into the districts of Ratangarh Kheri and\r\nSingoli; and at the same time made over those of Irnia, Jath, Bichor,\r\nand Nadwai to Holkar, the aggregate revenue of which amounted to six\r\nlakhs annually. Besides these alienations of territory, the Mahrattas\r\nlevied no less than four grand war contributions in S. 1830-31,[4.16.25]\r\nwhile in S. 1836[4.16.26] their rapacity exacted three more. Inability\r\nto liquidate these exorbitant demands was invariably a signal for\r\nfurther sequestration of land. Amidst such scenes of civil strife and\r\nexternal spoliation, one Mahratta following another in the same track of\r\nrapine, Hamir died before he had attained even Rajput majority,[4.16.27]\r\nin S. 1834 (A.D. 1778).\r\n\r\n=Recapitulation.=—We may here briefly recapitulate the diminution of\r\nterritory and wealth in Mewar from the period of the first Mahratta\r\nvisitation in A.D. 1736, to the death of Hamir. It were a waste of time\r\nto enumerate the rapacious individuals who shared in the spoils of this\r\ndevoted country. We may be content to say their name was ‘legion.’ These\r\nforty years were surcharged with evil. The Mogul princes observed at\r\nleast the forms of government and justice, which occasionally tempered\r\ntheir aggressions; the Mahrattas were associations of vampires, who\r\ndrained the very life-blood wherever the scent of spoil attracted them.\r\nIn three payments we have seen the enormous sum of one crore and\r\neighty-one lakhs,[4.16.28] upwards of two millions English money,\r\nexacted from Mewar, exclusive of individual contributions levied on\r\nchiefs, ministers, and the Pretender’s party: and a schedule drawn up by\r\nthe reigning prince of contributions levied up to his own time, amounts\r\nto £5,000,000 sterling. Yet the land would eventually have reimbursed\r\n[439] these sums, but the penalty inflicted for deficiencies of payment\r\nrenders the evil irremediable; for the alienated territory which then\r\nproduced an annual revenue of twenty-eight lakhs,[4.16.29] or £323,000\r\nsterling, exceeds in amount the sum-total now left, whether fiscal or\r\nfeudal, in the present impoverished state of the country.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.15.1:\r\n\r\n  [September 29, 1719.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.15.2:\r\n\r\n  [Nizāmu-l-mulk, Asaf Jāh, titles of Chīn Qilīch Khān, a Turkmān\r\n  officer in the service of Aurangzeb, governor of the Deccan, died May\r\n  22, 1748.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.15.3:\r\n\r\n  Amongst the archives of the Rana to which I had access, I discovered\r\n  an autograph letter of Raja Jai Singh, addressed at this important\r\n  juncture to the Rana’s prime minister, Biharidas.\r\n\r\n  \"The Amiru-l-umara has arrived, and engagements through Balaji Pandit\r\n  have been agreed to: he said that he always had friendship for me, but\r\n  advised me to march, a measure alike recommended by Kishan Singh and\r\n  Jiwa Lal. On this I presented an _arzi_ to his Majesty, stated the\r\n  advice, but desired to have his Majesty’s commands; when the king\r\n  sanctioning my leave, such being the general desire, on Thursday the\r\n  9th of Phālgun I moved, and pitched my tents at Sarbal Sarai. I told\r\n  the Rao Raja (of Bundi) to accompany me, but it did not reach his\r\n  mind, and he joined Kutbu-l-mulk, who gave him some horse, and made\r\n  him encamp with Ajit Singh. Bhim Singh’s (of Kotah) army arrived, and\r\n  an engagement took place, in which Jeth Singh Hara was killed, and the\r\n  Rao Raja fled to Allahwirdi Khan’s sarai. I sent troops to his aid;\r\n  the king has made over the baths and wardrobe to the Sayyids, who have\r\n  everything their own way. You know the Sayyids; I am on my way back to\r\n  my own country, and have much to say _vivâ voce_ to the\r\n  Huzur:[4.15.3.A] come and meet me.

He\r\nwas but eight years of age on his accession, and remained under his\r\nmother’s tutelage long after his minority had expired. This subjection\r\nfixed his character; naturally defective in energy, and impaired by long\r\nmisfortune, he continued to be swayed by faction and intrigue. The cause\r\nof the Pretender, though weakened, was yet kept alive; but his\r\ninsignificance eventually left him so unsupported, that his death is not\r\neven recorded [440].\r\n\r\n=Feud of Chondāwats and Saktāwats.=—In S. 1840 (A.D. 1784) the\r\nChondawats reaped the harvest of their allegiance and made the power\r\nthus acquired subservient to the indulgence of ancient animosities\r\nagainst the rival clan of Saktawat. Salumbar with his relatives Arjun\r\nSingh[4.17.1] of Kurabar and Partap Singh[4.17.2] of Amet, now ruled the\r\ncouncils, having the Sindi mercenaries under their leaders Chandan and\r\nSadik at their command. Mustering therefore all the strength of their\r\nkin and clans, they resolved on the prosecution of the feud, and\r\ninvested Bhindar, the castle of Mohkam the chief of the Saktawats,\r\nagainst which they placed their batteries.\r\n\r\nSangram Singh, a junior branch of the Saktawats, destined to play a\r\nconspicuous part in the future events of Mewar, was then rising into\r\nnotice, and had just completed a feud with his rival the Purawat, whose\r\nabode, Lawa,[4.17.3] he had carried by escalade; and now, determined to\r\nmake a diversion in favour of his chief, he invaded the estate of\r\nKurabar, engaged against Bhindar, and was driving off the cattle, when\r\nSalim Singh the heir of Kurabar intercepted his retreat, and an action\r\nensued in which Salim[4.17.4] was slain by the lance of Sangram. The\r\nafflicted father, on hearing the fate of his son, ‘threw the turban off\r\nhis head,’ swearing never to replace it till he had tasted revenge.\r\nFeigning a misunderstanding with his own party he withdrew from the\r\nsiege, taking the road to his estate, but suddenly abandoned it for\r\nSheogarh, the residence of Lalji the father of Sangram. The castle of\r\nSheogarh, placed amidst the mountains and deep forests of Chappan, was\r\nfrom its difficulty of access deemed secure against surprise; and here\r\nSangram had placed the females and children of his family. To this point\r\nArjun directed his revenge, and found Sheogarh destitute of defenders\r\nsave the aged chief; but though seventy summers had whitened his head,\r\nhe bravely met the storm, and fell in opposing the foe; when the\r\nchildren of Sangram were dragged [441] out and inhumanly butchered, and\r\nthe widow[4.17.5] of Lalji ascended the pyre. This barbarity aggravated\r\nthe hostility which separated the clans, and together with the minority\r\nof their prince and the yearly aggressions of the Mahrattas, accelerated\r\nthe ruin of the country. But Bhim Singh, the Chondawat leader, was\r\ngoverned by insufferable vanity, and not only failed in respect to his\r\nprince, but offended the queen regent. He parcelled out the crown domain\r\nfrom Chitor to Udaipur amongst the Sindi bands, and whilst his sovereign\r\nwas obliged to borrow money to defray his marriage at Idar, this\r\nungrateful noble had the audacity to disburse upwards of £100,000 on the\r\nmarriage of his own daughter. Such conduct determined the royal mother\r\nto supplant the Chondawats, and calling in the Saktawats to her aid, she\r\ninvested with power the chiefs of Bhindar and Lawa. Aware, however, that\r\ntheir isolated authority was insufficient to withstand their rivals,\r\nthey looked abroad for support, and made an overture to Zalim Singh of\r\nKotah, whose political and personal resentments to the Chondawats, as\r\nwell as his connexion by marriage with their opponents, made him readily\r\nlisten to it. With his friend the Mahratta, Lalaji Belal, he joined the\r\nSaktawats with a body of 10,000 men. It was determined to sacrifice the\r\nSalumbar chief, who took post in the ancient capital of Chitor, where\r\nthe garrison was composed chiefly of Sindis, thus effacing his claim to\r\nhis prince’s gratitude, whom he defied, while the pretender still had a\r\nparty in the other principal fortress, Kumbhalmer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAHĀRĀJA BHĪM SINGH, PRINCE OF UDAIPUR.\r\n  _To face page 512._\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Battle of Lālsot, May 1787.=—Such was the state of things, when the\r\nascendancy of Mahadaji Sindhia received a signal check from the combined\r\nforces of Marwar and Jaipur; and the battle of Lalsot, in which the\r\nMahratta chief was completely defeated, was the signal for the Rajputs\r\nto resume their alienated territory.[4.17.6] Nor was the Rana backward\r\non the occasion, when there appeared a momentary gleam of the active\r\nvirtue of past days. Maldas Mehta was civil minister, with Mauji Ram as\r\nhis deputy, both men of talent and energy. They first effected the\r\nreduction of Nimbahera and the smaller garrisons of Mahrattas in its\r\nvicinity, who from a sense of common danger assembled their detachments\r\nin Jawad, which was also invested. Sivaji Nana, the governor,\r\ncapitulated, and was allowed to march out with his [442] effects. At the\r\nsame time, the ‘sons of the black cloud’[4.17.7] assembling, drove the\r\nMahrattas from Begun, Singoli, etc., and the districts on the plateau;\r\nwhile the Chondawats redeemed their ancient fief of Rampura, and thus\r\nfor a while the whole territory was recovered. Elated by success, the\r\nunited chiefs advanced to Chardu on the banks of the Rarkia, a streamlet\r\ndividing Mewar from Malwa, preparatory to further operations. Had these\r\nbeen confined to the maintenance of the places they had taken, and which\r\nhad been withheld in violation of treaties, complete success might have\r\ncrowned their efforts; but in including Nimbahera in their capture they\r\ndrew upon them the energetic Ahalya Bai, the regent-queen of the Holkar\r\nState, who unluckily for them was at hand and who coalesced with\r\nSindhia’s partisans to check this reaction of the Rajputs. Tulaji\r\nSindhia and Sri Bhai, with five thousand horse, were ordered to support\r\nthe discomfited Siva Nana, who had taken refuge in Mandasor, where he\r\nrallied all the garrisons whom the Rajputs had unwisely permitted to\r\ncapitulate.\r\n\r\n=Defeat of the Rājputs. Murder of Somji.=—On Tuesday, the 4th of Magh S.\r\n1844,[4.17.8] the Rana’s troops were surprised and defeated with great\r\nslaughter, the minister slain, the chiefs of Kanor and Sadri with many\r\nothers severely wounded, and the latter made prisoner.[4.17.9] The newly\r\nmade conquests were all rapidly lost, with the exception of Jawad, which\r\nwas gallantly maintained for a month by Dip Chand, who, with his guns\r\nand rockets, effected a passage through the Mahrattas, and retired with\r\nhis garrison to Mandalgarh. Thus terminated an enterprise which might\r\nhave yielded far different results but for a misplaced security. All the\r\nchiefs and clans were united in this patriotic struggle except the\r\nChondawats, against whom the queen-mother and the new minister, Somji,\r\nhad much difficulty to contend for the establishment of the minor’s\r\nauthority. At length overtures were made to Salumbar, when the fair\r\nRampiyari was employed to conciliate the obdurate chief, who\r\ncondescended to make his appearance at Udaipur and to pay his respects\r\nto the prince. He pretended to enter into the views of the minister and\r\nto coalesce in his plans; but this was only a web to ensnare his victim,\r\nwhose talent had diminished his authority, and was a bar to the\r\nprosecution of [443] his ambitious views. Somji was seated in his bureau\r\nwhen Arjun Singh of Kurabar and Sardar Singh[4.17.10] of Badesar\r\nentered, and the latter, as he demanded how he dared to resume his fief,\r\nplunged his dagger into the minister’s breast. The Rana was passing the\r\nday at one of the villas in the valley called the Sahelia Bari, ‘the\r\ngarden of nymphs,’ attended by Jeth Singh of Badnor, when the\r\nbrothers[4.17.11] of the minister suddenly rushed into the presence to\r\nclaim protection against the murderers. They were followed by Arjun of\r\nKurabar, who had the audacity to present himself before his sovereign\r\nwith his hands yet stained with the blood of Somji. The Rana, unable to\r\npunish the insolent chief, branding him as a traitor, bade him begone;\r\nwhen the whole of the actors in this nefarious scene, with their leader\r\nSalumbar, returned to Chitor. Sheodas and Satidas, brothers to the\r\nmurdered minister, were appointed to succeed him, and with the Saktawats\r\nfought several actions against the rebels, and gained one decisive\r\nbattle at Akola, in which Arjun of Kurabar commanded. This was soon\r\nbalanced by the defeat of the Saktawats at Kheroda. Every triumph was\r\nattended with ruin to the country. The agriculturist, never certain of\r\nthe fruits of his labour, abandoned his fields, and at length his\r\ncountry; mechanical industry found no recompense, and commerce was at\r\nthe mercy of unlicensed spoliation. In a very few years Mewar lost half\r\nher population, her lands lay waste, her mines were unworked, and her\r\nlooms, which formerly supplied all around, forsaken. The prince partook\r\nof the general penury; instead of protecting, he required protection;\r\nthe bonds which united him with his subjects were snapped, and each\r\nindividual or petty community provided for itself that defence which he\r\ncould not give. Hence arose a train of evils: every cultivator, whether\r\nfiscal or feudal, sought out a patron, and [444] entered into\r\nengagements as the price of protection. Hence every Rajput who had a\r\nhorse and lance, had his clients; and not a camel-load of merchandise\r\ncould pass the abode of one of these cavaliers without paying fees. The\r\neffects of such disorder were felt long after the cause ceased to exist,\r\nand claims difficult to adjust arose out of these licentious times, for\r\nthe having prescriptive right was deemed sufficient to authorize their\r\ncontinuance.[4.17.12] Here were displayed the effects of a feudal\r\nassociation, where the powers of government were enfeebled. These feuds\r\nalone were sufficient to ruin the country; but when to such internal\r\nills shoals of Mahratta plunderers were added, no art is required to\r\ndescribe the consequences.\r\n\r\n=Aid sought from Sindhia.=—The Rana and his advisers at length\r\ndetermined to call in Sindhia to expel the rebellious Chondawats from\r\nthe ancient capital; a step mainly prompted by Zalim Singh (now Regent\r\nof Kotah), who with the Rana’s ministers was deputed to the Mahratta\r\nchieftain, then enjoying himself at the sacred lake of Pushkar.[4.17.13]\r\nSince the overthrow of Lalsot he had reorganized his brigades under the\r\ncelebrated De Boigne,[4.17.14] through whose conduct he had redeemed his\r\nlost influence in Rajputana by the battles of Merta and Patan, in which\r\nthe brave Rathors, after acts of the most devoted gallantry, were\r\ncompletely overthrown. Sindhia’s plans coincided entirely with the\r\nobject of the deputation, and he readily acquiesced in the Rana’s\r\ndesire. This event introduced on the political stage some of the most\r\ncelebrated men of that day, whose actions offer a fair picture of\r\nmanners, and may justify our entering a little into details.[4.17.15]\r\n\r\n=Negotiations by Zālim Singh.=—Zalim Singh had for some years become\r\nregent of Kotah, and though to maintain himself in power, and the State\r\nhe controlled in an attitude to compel the respect of surrounding foes,\r\nwas no slight task, yet he found the field too contracted for his\r\nambition, and his secret views had long been directed to permanent\r\ninfluence in Mewar. His skill in reading character convinced him that\r\nthe Rana would be no bar to his wishes, the attainment of which, by\r\ngiving him the combined resources of Haraoti and Mewar, would bestow the\r\nlead in Rajasthan. The Jaipur court he disregarded, whose effeminate\r\narmy he had himself defeated single-handed [445] with the Kotah troops,\r\nand the influence he established amongst the leading chiefs of Marwar\r\nheld out no fear of counteraction from that quarter. The stake was high,\r\nthe game sure, and success would have opened a field to his genius which\r\nmight have entirely altered the fate of Hindustan; but one false move\r\nwas irretrievable, and instead of becoming the arbitrator of India, he\r\nleft only the reputation of being the Nestor of Rajputana.\r\n\r\nThe restriction of the Rana’s power was the cloak under which he\r\ndisguised all his operations, and it might have been well for the\r\ncountry had his plans succeeded to their full extent. To re-establish\r\nthe Rana’s authority, and to pay the charges of the reduction of Chitor,\r\nhe determined that the rebels chiefly should furnish the means, and that\r\nfrom them and the fiscal lands, mostly in their hands, sixty-four lakhs\r\nshould be levied, of which three-fifths should be appropriated to\r\nSindhia, and the remainder to replenish the Rana’s treasury.\r\nPreliminaries being thus arranged, Zalim was furnished with a strong\r\ncorps under Ambaji Inglia; while Sindhia followed, hanging on the Marwar\r\nfrontier, to realize the contributions of that State. Zalim Singh and\r\nAmbaji moved towards Chitor, levying from the estates of those obnoxious\r\nto Zalim’s views. Hamirgarh, whose chief, Dhiraj Singh, a man of talent\r\nand courage, was the principal adviser of Bhim Singh, the Salumbar\r\nchief, was besieged, and stood several assaults during six weeks’\r\nvigorous operations, when the destruction of the springs of the wells\r\nfrom the concussion of the guns compelled its surrender, and the estate\r\nwas sequestrated. The force continued their progress, and after a\r\ntrifling altercation at Basai, a Chondawat fief, also taken, they took\r\nup a position at Chitor, and were soon after joined by the main body\r\nunder Sindhia.\r\n\r\n=Zālim Singh and Sindhia at Udaipur.=—Zalim, to gratify Mahadaji’s\r\nvanity, who was desirous of a visit from the Rana, which even the Peshwa\r\nconsidered an honour, proceeded to Udaipur to effect this object; when\r\nthe Rana, placing himself under his guidance, marched for this purpose,\r\nand was met at the Tiger Mount, within a few miles of his capital, by\r\nSindhia, who received the Rana, and escorted him to the besieging army.\r\nBut in this short interval, Ambaji, who remained with the army at\r\nChitor, intrigued with the rebel Chondawat to supplant the predominant\r\ninfluence of his friend Zalim Singh, and seized the opportunity of his\r\nabsence to counteract him, by [446] communicating his plans to Salumbar;\r\naware that, unless he broke with Zalim, he could only hope to play a\r\nsecondary part under him. Though the ulterior views of Zalim were kept\r\nto his own breast, they could not escape the penetration of the crafty\r\nMahratta; his very anxiety to hide them furnished Ambaji with the means\r\nof detection. Had Zalim possessed an equal share of meanness with his\r\npolitical antagonist, he might have extricated himself from the snare;\r\nbut once overreached, he preferred sinking to grasping at an unworthy\r\nsupport. Bhim Singh (Salumbar) privately negotiated with Ambaji the\r\nsurrender of Chitor, engaging to humble himself before the Rana, and to\r\npay a contribution of twenty lakhs, levied on the clans, provided Zalim\r\nSingh was ordered to retire. This suggestion, apparently founded on the\r\nrebellious chief’s antipathy to Zalim, but in reality prompted by\r\nAmbaji, ensured the approbation, as it suited the views, of all parties,\r\nbut especially Sindhia, who was desirous of repairing to Poona. Zalim,\r\nthe sole obstacle to this arrangement, furnished to his enemies the\r\nmeans of escape from the dilemma, and lost the opportunity of realizing\r\nhis long-cherished scheme of wielding the united resources of Mewar and\r\nHaraoti. Zalim had always preserved a strict amity with Ambaji wherever\r\ntheir interests did not clash, and his regard had the cement of\r\ngratitude to the Mahratta, whose father Trimbakji had saved Zalim’s life\r\nand procured his liberty, when left wounded and a prisoner at the battle\r\nof Ujjain. On Zalim’s return with the Rana, Ambaji touched on the terms\r\nof Bhim Singh’s surrender, hinting that Zalim’s presence was the sole\r\nobstacle to this desirable result; who, the more to mask his views,\r\nwhich any expressed reluctance to the measure might expose, went beyond\r\nprobability in asseverations of readiness to be no bar to such\r\narrangement, even so far as to affirm that, besides being tired of the\r\nbusiness from the heavy expense it entailed on him, he had his prince’s\r\nwish for his return to Kotah. There is one ingredient in Zalim’s\r\ncharacter, which has never been totally merged in the vices acquired\r\nfrom the tortuous policy of a long life, and which in the vigour of\r\nyouth had full sway—namely, pride, one of the few virtues left to the\r\nRajput, defrauded of many others by long oppression. But Zalim’s pride\r\nwas legitimate, being allied to honour, and it has retained him an\r\nevident superiority through all the mazes of ambition. Ambaji skilfully\r\navailed himself of this defect in his friend’s political character. \"A\r\npretty [447] story, indeed!—you tell this to me! it might find credit\r\nwith those who did not know you.\" The sarcasm only plunged him deeper\r\ninto asseveration. “Is it then really your wish to retire?” “Assuredly.”\r\n“Then,” retorted the crafty Ambaji, “your wish shall be gratified in a\r\nfew minutes.” Giving him no time to retract, he called for his horse and\r\ngalloped to Sindhia’s tent. Zalim relied on Sindhia not acceding to the\r\nproposition; or if he did, that the Rana, over whom he imagined he had\r\ncomplete influence, would oppose it. His hopes of Sindhia rested on a\r\npromise privately made to leave troops under his authority for the\r\nrestoration of order in Mewar; and a yet stronger claim, the knowledge\r\nthat without Zalim he could not realize the stipulated sums for the\r\nexpulsion of the Chondawat from Chitor. Ambaji had foreseen and prepared\r\na remedy for these difficulties, and upon their being urged offered\r\nhimself to advance the amount by bills on the Deccan. This argument was\r\nirresistible; money, and the consequent prosecution of his journey to\r\nPoona, being attained, Sindhia’s engagements with Zalim and the Rana\r\nceased to be a matter of importance. He nominated Ambaji his lieutenant,\r\nwith the command of a large force, by whose aid he would reimburse\r\nhimself for the sums thus advanced. Having carried his object with\r\nSindhia, Ambaji proceeded direct from his tent to that of the Rana’s\r\nministers, Sheodas and Satidas, with whom, by the promise of\r\nco-operation in their views, and perfect subserviency to the Rana’s\r\ninterests, he was alike successful. Ambaji, with the rapidity necessary\r\nto ensure success, having in a few hours accomplished his purpose,\r\nhastened back to Zalim, to acquaint him that his wish to retire had met\r\nwith general acquiescence; and so well did he manage, that the Rana’s\r\nmace-bearer arrived at the same moment to announce that the khilat of\r\nleave awaited his acceptance. Zalim being thus outwitted, the Salumbar\r\nchief descended from Chitor, and touched the Rana’s feet. Sindhia\r\npursued his march to the Deccan, and Ambaji was left sole arbiter of\r\nMewar. The Saktawats maintained the lead at court, and were not backward\r\nin consigning the estates of their rivals to the incubus now settled on\r\nthe country: while the mortified Zalim, on his retreat, recorded his\r\nexpenses, to be produced on some fitting occasion.\r\n\r\n=Sindhia’s Instructions to Ambaji.=—Ambaji remained eight years in\r\nMewar, reaping its revenues and amassing those hoards of wealth which\r\nsubsequently gave him the lead in Hindustan, and enabled him nearly to\r\nassert his independence. Yet, although he accumulated [448] £2,000,000\r\nsterling from her soil,[4.17.16] exacting one-half of the produce of\r\nagricultural industry, the suppression of feuds and exterior aggressions\r\ngave to Mewar a degree of tranquillity and happiness to which she had\r\nlong been a stranger. The instructions delivered to Ambaji were—\r\n\r\n    1. The entire restoration of the Rana’s authority and resumption\r\n\r\n    of the crown-lands from rebellious chiefs and mercenary Sindis.\r\n\r\n    2. The expulsion of the pretender from Kumbhalmer.\r\n    3. The recovery of Godwar from the Raja of Marwar.\r\n    4. To settle the Bundi feud for the murder of Rana Arsi.\r\n\r\nA schedule (_pandhri_)[4.17.17] for the twenty lakhs stipulated was made\r\nand levied; twelve from the Chondawat estates and eight from the\r\nSaktawats; and the sum of sixty lakhs was awarded, besides the expense\r\nof Ambaji’s army, when the other specified objects should be attained.\r\nWithin two years the pretender was expelled Kumbhalmer, Jahazpur was\r\nrecovered from a rebellious Ranawat, and the crown-lands[4.17.18] were\r\nredeemed from the nobles; the personal domain of the Rana, agricultural\r\nand commercial, still realized nearly fifty lakhs of rupees. After these\r\nservices, though Godwar was still unredeemed, the Bundi feud unappeased,\r\nand the lands mortgaged to the Mahrattas were not restored, Ambaji\r\nassumed the title of Subahdar of Mewar, and identified himself with the\r\nparties of the day. Yet so long as he personally upheld the interests of\r\nthe Rana, his memory is done justice to, notwithstanding he never\r\nconformed to the strict letter of his engagements. The Rana’s ministers,\r\nfearing lest their brother’s fate should be theirs in the event of the\r\nChondawats again attaining power, and deeming their own and their\r\nsovereign’s security dependent on Ambaji’s presence, made a subsidiary\r\nengagement with him, and lands to the amount of 75,000 rupees monthly,\r\nor eight lakhs annually, were appropriated for his force; but so\r\ncompletely were the resources of the [449] country diverted from their\r\nhonest use, that when, in S. 1851, a marriage was negotiated between the\r\nRana’s sister and the prince of Jaipur, the Rana was obliged to borrow\r\n£50,000 from the Mahratta commander to purchase the nuptial presents.\r\nThe following year was marked by a triple event—the death of the\r\nqueen-mother, the birth of a son and heir to the Rana, and the bursting\r\nof the embankment of the lake, which swept away a third of the city and\r\na third of its inhabitants. Superstition attributed this catastrophe to\r\nthe Rana’s impiety, in establishing a new festival[4.17.19] to Gauri,\r\nthe Isis of Rajasthan.\r\n\r\n=Anarchy in Mewār.=—Ambaji, who was this year nominated by Sindhia his\r\nviceroy in Hindustan, left Ganesh Pant as his lieutenant in Mewar, with\r\nwhom acted the Rana’s officers, Sawai and Shirji Mehta;[4.17.20] who\r\napplied themselves to make the most of their ephemeral power with so\r\nrapacious a spirit, that Ambaji was compelled to displace Ganesh Pant\r\nand appoint the celebrated Rae Chand. To him they would not yield, and\r\neach party formed a nucleus for disorder and misrule. It would be\r\nuninteresting and nauseating to the reader to carry him through all the\r\nscenes of villainy which gradually desolated this country; for whose\r\nspoil pilfering Mahrattas, savage Rohillas, and adventurous Franks were\r\nall let loose. The now humbled Chondawats, many of whose fiefs were\r\nconfiscated, took to horse, and in conjunction with lawless Sindis\r\nscoured the country. Their estates were attacked, Kurabar was taken, and\r\nbatteries were placed against Salumbar, whence the Sindis fled and found\r\nrefuge in Deogarh. In this exigence, the Chondawats determined to send\r\nan envoy to Ambaji, who was then engaged in the siege of Datia; and Ajit\r\nSingh, since prominent in the intrigues of Mewar, was the organ of his\r\nclan on this occasion. For the sum of ten lakhs the avaricious Mahratta\r\nagreed to recall his deputy from Mewar,[4.17.21] to renounce Sheodas and\r\nthe Saktawats, and lend his support to the Chondawats. The Salumbar\r\nchief again took the lead at court, and with Agarji Mehta[4.17.22] as\r\nminister, the Saktawats [450] were attacked, the stipulated ten lakhs\r\nraised from their estates, and two fiefs of note, Hintha and Semari,\r\nconfiscated [451].\r\n\r\n=Death of Mahādaji Sindhia, January 12, 1794.=—The death of Mahadaji\r\nSindhia,[4.17.23] and the accession of his nephew Daulatrao, his murder\r\nof the Shenvi Brahmans, and his quarrels with the Bais (‘princesses,’\r\nwives of the deceased Sindhia), all occurred at this time, and\r\nmaterially influenced the events in Mewar. The power of Ambaji as\r\nSubahdar of Hindustan was strengthened by the minority of Sindhia,\r\nalthough contested by Lakwa and the Bais, supported by the Khichi\r\nprince, Durjan Sal, and the Datia Raja, who fought and died for the\r\nprincesses. Lakwa wrote to the Rana to throw off Ambaji’s yoke and expel\r\nhis lieutenant; while Ambaji commanded his deputy to eject the\r\nShenvi[4.17.24] Brahmans, supporters of Lakwa, from all the lands in\r\nMewar. To this end Ganesh Pant called on the Rana’s ministers and\r\nchiefs, who, consulting thereon, determined to play a deep game; and\r\nwhile they apparently acquiesced in the schemes of Ganesh, they wrote\r\nthe Shenvis to advance from Jawad and attack him, promising them\r\nsupport. They met at Sawa; Nana was defeated with the loss of his guns,\r\nand retired on Chitor. With a feint of support, the Chondawats made him\r\nagain call in his garrison and try another battle, which he also lost\r\nand fled to Hamirgarh; then, uniting with his enemies, they invested the\r\nplace with 15,000 men. Nana bravely maintained himself, making many\r\nsallies, in one of which both the sons of Dhiraj Singh, the chief of\r\nHamirgarh, were slain. Shortly after, Nana was relieved by some\r\nbattalions of the new raised regulars sent by Ambaji under Gulab Rao\r\nKadam, upon which he commenced his retreat on Ajmer. At Musamusi he was\r\nforced to action, and success had nearly crowned the efforts of the\r\nclans, when a horseman, endeavouring to secure a mare, calling out\r\n[452], \"_Bhagi! bhagi!_\" “She flies! she flies!” the word spread, while\r\nthose who caught her, exclaiming \"_Milgayi! milgayi!_\" “She is taken!”\r\nbut equally significant with ‘going over’ to the enemy, caused a general\r\npanic, and the Chondawats, on the verge of victory, disgraced\r\nthemselves, broke and fled. Several were slain, among whom was the Sindi\r\nleader Chandan. Shahpura opened its gates to the fugitives led by the\r\nGoliath of the host, the chief of Deogarh.[4.17.25] It was an occasion\r\nnot to be lost by the bards of the rival clan, and many a ribald stanza\r\nrecords this day’s disgrace. Ambaji’s lieutenant, however, was so\r\nroughly handled that several chiefs redeemed their estates, and the Rana\r\nmuch of the fisc, from Mahratta control.\r\n\r\n=Contest of Ambaji and Lakwa.=—Mewar now became the arena on which the\r\nrival satraps Ambaji and Lakwa contested the exalted office of Sindhia’s\r\nlieutenancy in Hindustan. Lakwa was joined by all the chiefs of Mewar,\r\nhis cause being their own; and Hamirgarh, still held by Nana’s party,\r\nwas reinvested. Two thousand shot had made a practicable breach, when\r\nBala Rao Inglia, Bapu Sindhia, Jaswant Rao Sindhia, a brigade under the\r\nEuropean ‘Mutta field,’[4.17.26] with the auxiliary battalions of Zalim\r\nSingh of Kotah, the whole under the command of Ambaji’s son, arrived to\r\nrelieve the lieutenant. Lakwa raised the siege, and took post with his\r\nallies under the walls of Chitor; whilst the besieged left the untenable\r\nHamirgarh, and joined the relief at Gosunda. The rival armies were\r\nseparated only by the Berach river, on whose banks they raised batteries\r\nand cannonaded each other, when a dispute arose in the victor camp\r\nregarding the pay of the troops, between Bala Rao (brother of Ambaji)\r\nand Nana, and the latter withdrew and retreated to Sanganer. Thus\r\ndisunited, it might have been expected that these congregated masses\r\nwould have dissolved, or fallen upon each other, when the Rajputs might\r\nhave given the _coup de grâce_ to the survivors; but they were\r\nMahrattas, and their politics were too complicated to end in simple\r\nstrife: almost all the actors in these scenes lived to contest with, and\r\nbe humiliated by, the British.\r\n\r\n=George Thomas.=—The defection of Nana equalized the parties; but Bala\r\nRao, never partial to fighting, opportunely recollected a debt of\r\ngratitude to Lakwa, to whose clemency he owed his life when taken by\r\nstorm in Gugal Chapra. He also wanted money [453] to pay his force,\r\nwhich a private overture to Lakwa secured. They met, and Bala Rao\r\nretired boasting of his gratitude, to which, and the defection of Nana,\r\nsoon followed by that of Bapu Sindhia, the salvation of Lakwa was\r\nattributed. Sutherland[4.17.27] with a brigade was detached by Ambaji to\r\naid Nana: but a dispute depriving him of this reinforcement, he called\r\nin a partisan of more celebrity, the brave George Thomas.[4.17.28]\r\nAmbaji’s lieutenant and Lakwa were once more equal foes, and the Rana,\r\nhis chiefs and subjects being distracted between these conflicting\r\nbands, whose leaders alternately paid their respects to him, were glad\r\nto obtain a little repose by espousing the cause of either combatant,\r\nwhose armies during the monsoon encamped for six weeks within sight of\r\neach other.[4.17.29]\r\n\r\n=Pillage in Mewār.=—Durjan Sal (Khichi), with the nobles of Mewar,\r\nhovered round Nana’s camp with five thousand horse to cut off his\r\nsupplies; but Thomas escorted the convoys from Shahpura with his\r\nregulars, and defied all their efforts. Thomas at length advanced his\r\nbatteries against Lakwa, on whose position a general assault was about\r\ntaking place, when a tremendous storm, with torrents of rain which\r\nfilled the stream, cut off his batteries from the main body, burst the\r\ngates of Shahpura, his _point d’appui_, and laid the town in\r\nruins.[4.17.30] Lakwa seized the moment, and with the Mewar chiefs\r\nstormed and carried the isolated batteries, capturing fifteen pieces of\r\ncannon; and the Shahpura Raja, threatened at once by his brother-nobles\r\nand the vengeance of heaven, refused further provision to Nana, who was\r\ncompelled to abandon his position and retreat to Sanganer. The\r\ndiscomfited lieutenant vowed vengeance against the estates of the Mewar\r\nchieftains, and after the rains, being reinforced by Ambaji, again took\r\nthe field. Then commenced a scene of carnage, pillage, and individual\r\ndefence. The whole of the Chondawat estates under the Aravalli range\r\nwere laid waste, their castles assaulted, some taken and destroyed, and\r\nheavy sums levied on all. Thomas besieged Deogarh and Amet, and both\r\nfought and paid. Kasital and Lasani were captured, and the latter razed\r\nfor its gallant resistance. Thus they were proceeding in the work of\r\ndestruction, when Ambaji [454] was dispossessed of the government of\r\nHindustan, to which Lakwa was nominated,[4.17.31] and Nana was compelled\r\nto surrender all the fortresses and towns he held in Mewar.\r\n\r\n=Daulat Rāo Sindhia reduces Mewār.=—From this period must be dated the\r\npretensions of Sindhia to consider Mewar as tributary to him. We have\r\ntraced the rise of the Mahrattas, and the progress of their baneful\r\ninfluence in Mewar. The abstractions of territory from S. 1826 to 1831\r\n[A.D. 1769-74], as pledges for contributions, satisfied their avarice\r\ntill 1848 [A.D. 1791], when the Salumbar rebellion brought the great\r\nSindhia to Chitor, leaving Ambaji as his lieutenant, with a subsidiary\r\nforce, to recover the Rana’s lost possessions. We have related how these\r\nconditions were fulfilled; how Ambaji, inflated with the wealth of\r\nMewar, assumed almost regal dignity in Hindustan, assigning the devoted\r\nland to be governed by his deputies, whose contest with other aspirants\r\nmade this unhappy region the stage for constant struggles for supremacy;\r\nand while the secret policy of Zalim Singh stimulated the Saktawats to\r\ncling to Ambaji, the Chondawats gave their influence and interest to his\r\nrival Lakwa. The unhappy Rana and the peasantry paid for this rivalry;\r\nwhile Sindhia, whose power was now in its zenith, fastened one of his\r\ndesultory armies on Mewar, in contravention of former treaties, without\r\nany definite views, or even instructions to its commander. It was enough\r\nthat a large body should supply itself without assailing him for prey,\r\nand whose services were available when required.\r\n\r\n=Lakwa Dāda Marātha Viceroy.=—Lakwa, the new viceroy, marched to Mewar:\r\nAgarji Mehta was appointed minister to the Rana, and the Chondawats\r\nagain came into power. For the sum of six lakhs Lakwa dispossessed the\r\nShahpura of Jahazpur, for the liquidation of which thirty-six of its\r\ntowns were mortgaged. Zalim Singh, who had long been manœuvring to\r\nobtain Jahazpur, administered to the necessities of the Mahratta, paid\r\nthe note of hand, and took possession of the city and its villages. A\r\ncontribution of twenty-four lakhs was imposed throughout the country,\r\nand levied by force of arms, after which first act of the new viceroy he\r\nquitted Mewar for Jaipur, leaving Jaswant Rao Bhao as his deputy. Mauji\r\nRam, the deputy of Agarji (the Rana’s minister), determined to adopt the\r\nEuropean mode of discipline, now become general amongst all the native\r\npowers of India. But when the chiefs were [455] called upon to\r\ncontribute to the support of mercenary regulars and a field-artillery,\r\nthey evinced their patriotism by confining this zealous minister.\r\nSatidas was once more placed in power, and his brother Sheodas recalled\r\nfrom Kotah, whither he had fled from the Chondawats, who now\r\nappropriated to themselves the most valuable portions of the Rana’s\r\npersonal domain.\r\n\r\n=Holkar defeated at Indore. Plunder of Nāthdwāra: image removed.=—The\r\nbattle of Indore,[4.17.32] in A.D. 1802, where at least 150,000 men\r\nassembled to dispute the claim to predatory empire, wrested the\r\nascendancy from Holkar, who lost his guns, equipage, and capital, from\r\nwhich he fled to Mewar, pursued by Sindhia’s victorious army led by\r\nSadasheo and Bala Rao. In his flight he plundered Ratlam, and passing\r\nBhindar, the castle of the Saktawat chief, he demanded a contribution,\r\nfrom which and his meditated visit to Udaipur, the Rana and his vassal\r\nwere saved by the activity of the pursuit. Failing in these objects,\r\nHolkar retreated on Nathdwara, the celebrated shrine of the Hindu\r\nApollo.[4.17.33] It was here this active soldier first showed symptoms\r\nof mental derangement. He upbraided Krishna, while prostrate before his\r\nimage, for the loss of his victory; and levied three lakhs of rupees on\r\nthe priests and inhabitants, several of whom he carried to his camp as\r\nhostages for the payment. The portal (_dwara_) of the god (_Nath_)\r\nproving no bar either to Turk or equally impious Mahratta, Damodarji,\r\nthe high priest, removed the god of Vraj from his pedestal and sent him\r\nwith his establishment to Udaipur for protection. The Chauhan chief of\r\nKotharia (one of the sixteen nobles), in whose estate was the sacred\r\nfane, undertook the duty, and with twenty horsemen, his vassals,\r\nescorted the shepherd god by intricate passes to the capital. On his\r\nreturn he was intercepted by a band of Holkar’s troops, who insultingly\r\ndesired the surrender of their horses. But the descendant of the\r\nillustrious Prithiraj preferred death to dishonour: dismounting, he\r\nhamstrung his steed, commanding his vassals to follow his example; and\r\nsword in hand courted his fate in the unequal conflict, in which he\r\nfell, with most of his gallant retainers. There are many such isolated\r\nexploits in the records of this eventful period, of which the Chauhans\r\nof Kotharia had their full share. Spoil, from whatever source, being\r\nwelcome to these depredators, Nathdwara[4.17.34] remained long\r\nabandoned; and Apollo, after six months’ residence at Udaipur, finding\r\n[456] insufficient protection, took another flight to the mountains of\r\nGhasyar, where the high priest threw up fortifications for his defence;\r\nand spiritual thunders being disregarded, the pontiff henceforth buckled\r\non the armour of flesh, and at the head of four hundred cavaliers with\r\nlance and shield, visited the minor shrines in his extensive diocese.\r\n\r\n=The Inroad of Holkar.=—To return to Holkar. He pursued his route by\r\nBanera and Shahpura, levying from both, to Ajmer, where he distributed a\r\nportion of the offerings of the followers of Krishna amongst the priests\r\nof Muhammad at the mosque of Khwaja Pir. Thence he proceeded towards\r\nJaipur. Sindhia’s leaders on reaching Mewar renounced the pursuit, and\r\nUdaipur was cursed with their presence, when three lakhs of rupees were\r\nextorted from the unfortunate Rana, raised by the sale of household\r\neffects and the jewels of the females of his family. Jaswant Rao Bhao,\r\nthe Subahdar of Mewar, had prepared another schedule (_pandhri_), which\r\nhe left with Tantia, his deputy, to realize. Then followed the usual\r\nscene of conflict—the attack of the chieftain’s estates, distraining of\r\nthe husbandman, seizure of his cattle, and his captivity for ransom, or\r\nhis exile.\r\n\r\n=Mewār Quarrels.=—The celebrated Lakwa, disgraced by his prince, died at\r\nthis time[4.17.35] in sanctuary at Salumbar; and Bala Rao, brother to\r\nAmbaji, returned, and was joined by the Saktawats and the minister\r\nSatidas, who expelled the Chondawats for their control over the prince.\r\nZalim Singh, in furtherance of his schemes and through hatred of the\r\nChondawats, united himself to this faction, and Devi Chand, minister to\r\nthe Rana, set up by the Chondawats, was made prisoner. Bala Rao levied\r\nand destroyed their estates with unexampled ferocity, which produced a\r\nbold attempt at deliverance. The Chondawat leaders assembled at the\r\nChaugan (the _Champ de Mars_) to consult on their safety. The insolent\r\nMahratta had preceded them to the palace, demanding the surrender of the\r\nminister’s deputy, Mauji Ram. The Rana indignantly refused them—the\r\nMahratta importuned, threatened, and at length commanded his troops to\r\nadvance to the palace, when the intrepid minister pinioned the audacious\r\nplunderers, and secured his adherents (including their old enemy, Nana\r\nGanesh), Jamalkar, and Uda Kunwar. The latter, a notorious villain, had\r\nan elephant’s chain put round his neck, while Bala Rao was confined in a\r\nbath. The [457] leaders thus arrested, the Chondawats sallied forth and\r\nattacked their camp in the valley, which surrendered; though the\r\nregulars under Hearsey[4.17.36] retreated in a hollow square, and\r\nreached Gadarmala in safety. Zalim Singh determined to liberate his\r\nfriend Bala Rao from peril; and aided by the Saktawats under the chiefs\r\nof Bhindar and Lawa, advanced to the Chaija Pass, one of the defiles\r\nleading to the capital. Had the Rana put these chiefs to instant death,\r\nhe would have been justified, although he would have incurred the\r\nresentment of the whole Mahratta nation. Instead of this, he put himself\r\nat the head of a motley levy of six thousand Sindis, Arabs, and Gosains,\r\nwith the brave Jai Singh and a band of his gallant Khichis, ever ready\r\nto poise the lance against a Mahratta. They defended the pass for five\r\ndays against a powerful artillery. At length the Rana was compelled to\r\nliberate Bala Rao, and Zalim Singh obtained by this interference\r\npossession of the fortress and entire district of Jahazpur. A schedule\r\nof war contribution, the usual finale to these events, followed Bala’s\r\nliberation, and no means were left untried to realize the exaction,\r\nbefore Holkar, then approaching, could contest the spoil.\r\n\r\n=Holkar plunders Udaipur.=—This chief, having recruited his shattered\r\nforces, again left the south.[4.17.37] Bhindar felt his resentment for\r\nnon-compliance with his demands on his retreat after the battle of\r\nIndore; the town was nearly destroyed, but spared for two lakhs of\r\nrupees, for the payment of which villages were assigned. Thence he\r\nrepaired to Udaipur, being met by Ajit Singh, the Rana’s ambassador,\r\nwhen the enormous sum of forty lakhs, or £500,000, was demanded from the\r\ncountry, of which one-third was commanded to be instantly forthcoming.\r\nThe palace was denuded of everything which could be converted into gold;\r\nthe females were deprived of every article of luxury and comfort: by\r\nwhich, with contributions levied on the city, twelve lakhs were\r\nobtained; while hostages from the household of the Rana and chief\r\ncitizens were delivered as security for the remainder, and immured in\r\nthe Mahratta camp. Holkar then visited the Rana. Lawa and Badnor were\r\nattacked, taken, and restored on large payments. Deogarh alone was\r\nmulcted four and a half lakhs. Having devastated Mewar during eight\r\nmonths, Holkar [458] marched to Hindustan,[4.17.38] Ajit Singh\r\naccompanying him as the Rana’s representative; while Bala Ram Seth was\r\nleft to levy the balance of the forty lakhs. Holkar had reached Shahpura\r\nwhen Sindhia entered Mewar, and their camps formed a junction to allow\r\nthe leaders to organize their mutual plans of hostility to the British\r\nGovernment. These chieftains, in their efforts to cope with the British\r\npower, had been completely humiliated, and their resources broken. But\r\nRajasthan was made to pay the penalty of British success, which riveted\r\nher chains, and it would be but honest, now we have the power, to\r\ndiminish that penalty.\r\n\r\n=Sindhia and Holkar in Mewār.=—The rainy season of A.D. 1805 found\r\nSindhia and Holkar encamped in the plains of Badnor, desirous, but\r\nafraid, to seek revenge in the renewal of war. Deprived of all power in\r\nHindustan, and of the choicest territory north and south of the\r\nNerbudda, with numerous discontented armies now let loose on these\r\ndevoted countries, their passions inflamed by defeat, and blind to every\r\nsentiment of humanity, they had no alternative to pacify the soldiery\r\nand replenish their own ruined resources but indiscriminate pillage. It\r\nwould require a pen powerful as the pencil of Salvator Rosa to paint the\r\nhorrors which filled up the succeeding ten years, to which the author\r\nwas an eye-witness, destined to follow in the train of rapine, and to\r\nview in the traces of Mahratta camps[4.17.39] the desolation and\r\npolitical annihilation of all the central States of India,[4.17.40]\r\nseveral of which aided the British in their early struggle for dominion,\r\nbut were now allowed to fall without a helping hand, the scapegoats of\r\nour successes. Peace between the Mahrattas and British was, however,\r\ndoubtful, as Sindhia made the restoration of the rich provinces of Gohad\r\nand Gwalior a _sine qua non_: and unhappily for their legitimate ruler,\r\nwho [459] had been inducted into the seat of his forefathers, a\r\nGovernor-General (Lord Cornwallis) of ancient renown, but in the decline\r\nof life, with views totally unsuited to the times, abandoned our allies,\r\nand renounced all for peace, sending an ambassador[4.17.41] to Sindhia\r\nto reunite the bonds of ‘perpetual friendship.’\r\n\r\n=Holkar saves Mewār from Sindhia.=—The Mahratta leaders were anxious, if\r\nthe war should be renewed, to shelter their families and valuables in\r\nthe strongholds of Mewar, and their respective camps became the\r\nrendezvous of the rival factions. Sardar Singh, the organ of the\r\nChondawats, represented the Rana at Sindhia’s court, at the head of\r\nwhose councils Ambaji had just been placed.[4.17.42] His rancour to the\r\nRana was implacable, from the support given in self-defence to his\r\npolitical antagonist, Lakwa, and he agitated the partition of Mewar\r\namongst the great Mahratta leaders. But whilst his baneful influence was\r\npreparing this result, the credit of Sangram Saktawat with Holkar\r\ncounteracted it. It would be unfair and ungallant not to record that a\r\nfair suitor, the Baiza Bai,[4.17.43] Sindhia’s wife, powerfully\r\ncontributed to the Rana’s preservation on this occasion. This lady, the\r\ndaughter of the notorious Sarji Rao, had unbounded power over Sindhia.\r\nHer sympathies were awakened on behalf of the supreme head of the Rajput\r\nnation, of which blood she had to boast, though she was now connected\r\nwith the Mahrattas. Even the hostile clans stifled their animosities on\r\nthis occasion, and Sardar Singh Chondawat left Sindhia’s camp to join\r\nhis rival Sangram with Holkar, and aided by the upright Kishandas\r\nPancholi, united in their remonstrances, asking Holkar if he had given\r\nhis consent to sell Mewar to Ambaji. Touched by the picture of the\r\nRana’s and their country’s distresses, Holkar swore it should not be;\r\nadvised unity amongst themselves, and caused the representatives of the\r\nrival clans ‘to eat opium together.’ Nor did he stop here, but with the\r\nenvoys repaired to Sindhia’s tents, descanted on the Rana’s high\r\ndescent, ‘the master of their master’s master,’[4.17.44] urging that it\r\ndid not become them to overwhelm him, and that they should even renounce\r\nthe mortgaged lands which their fathers had too long unjustly held,\r\nhimself setting the example by the restitution of [460] Nimbahera. To\r\nstrengthen his argument, he expatiated with Sindhia on the policy of\r\nconciliating the Rana, whose strongholds might be available in the event\r\nof a renewal of hostilities with the British. Sindhia appeared a convert\r\nto his views, and retained the envoys in his camp. The Mahratta camps\r\nwere twenty miles apart, and incessant torrents of rain had for some\r\ndays prevented all intercourse. In this interim, Holkar received\r\nintelligence that Bhairon Bakhsh, as envoy from the Rana, was in Lord\r\nLake’s camp negotiating for the aid of British troops, then at Tonk, to\r\ndrive the Mahrattas from Mewar. The incensed Holkar sent for the Rana’s\r\nambassadors, and assailed them with a torrent of reproach; accusing them\r\nof treachery, he threw the newspaper containing the information at\r\nKishandas, asking if that were the way in which the Mewaris kept faith\r\nwith him? “I cared not to break with Sindhia in support of your master,\r\nand while combating the Farangis (Franks), when all the Hindus should be\r\nas brothers, your sovereign the Rana, who boasts of not acknowledging\r\nthe supremacy of Delhi, is the first to enter into arms with them. Was\r\nit for this I prevented Ambaji being fastened on you?” Kishandas here\r\ninterrupted and attempted to pacify him, when Alikar Tantia, Holkar’s\r\nminister, stopped him short, observing to his prince, “You see the faith\r\nof these Rangras;[4.17.45] they would disunite you and Sindhia, and ruin\r\nboth. Shake them off: be reconciled to Sindhia, dismiss Sarji Rao, and\r\nlet Ambaji be Subahdar of Mewar, or I will leave you and take Sindhia\r\ninto Malwa.” The other councillors, with the exception of Bhao Bhaskar,\r\nseconded this advice: Sarji Rao was dismissed; and Holkar proceeded\r\nnorthward, where he was encountered and pursued to the Panjab by the\r\nBritish under the intrepid and enterprising Lake, who dictated terms to\r\nthe Mahratta at the altars of Alexander.[4.17.46]\r\n\r\n=Holkar protects Mewār Interests.=—Holkar had the generosity to\r\nstipulate, before his departure from Mewar, for the security of the Rana\r\nand his country, telling Sindhia he should hold him personally amenable\r\nto him if Ambaji were permitted to violate his guarantee. But in his\r\nmisfortunes this threat was disregarded, and a contribution of sixteen\r\nlakhs was levied immediately on Mewar; Sadasheo Rao, with\r\nBaptiste’s[4.17.47] brigade, was detached from the camp in June 1806,\r\nfor the double purpose of levying it, and driving from [461] Udaipur a\r\ndetachment of the Jaipur prince’s troops, bringing proposals and\r\npreliminary presents for this prince’s marriage with the Rana’s\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n=The Tragedy of Krishna Kunwāri.=—It would be imagined that the miseries\r\nof Rana Bhim were not susceptible of aggravation, and that fortune had\r\ndone her worst to humble him; but his pride as a sovereign and his\r\nfeelings as a parent were destined to be yet more deeply wounded. The\r\nJaipur cortège had encamped near the capital, to the number of three\r\nthousand men, while the Rana’s acknowledgments of acceptance were\r\ndispatched, and had reached Shahpura. But Raja Man of Marwar also\r\nadvanced pretensions, founded on the princess having been actually\r\nbetrothed to his predecessor; and urging that the throne of Marwar, and\r\nnot the individual occupant, was the object, he vowed resentment and\r\nopposition if his claims were disregarded. These were suggested, it is\r\nsaid, by his nobles to cloak their own views; and promoted by the\r\nChondawats (then in favour with the Rana), whose organ, Ajit, was bribed\r\nto further them, contrary to the decided wishes of their prince.\r\n\r\nKrishna Kunwari (the _Virgin_ Krishna) was the name of the lovely\r\nobject, the rivalry for whose hand assembled under the banners of her\r\nsuitors (Jagat Singh of Jaipur and Raja Man of Marwar), not only their\r\nnative chivalry, but all the predatory powers of India; and who, like\r\nHelen of old, involved in destruction her own and the rival houses.\r\nSindhia having been denied a pecuniary demand by Jaipur, not only\r\nopposed the nuptials, but aided the claims of Raja Man, by demanding of\r\nthe Rana the dismissal of the Jaipur embassy: which being refused, he\r\nadvanced his brigades and batteries, and after a fruitless resistance,\r\nin which the Jaipur troops joined, forced the pass, threw a corps of\r\neight thousand men into the valley, and following in person, encamped\r\nwithin cannon-range of the city. The Rana had now no alternative but to\r\ndismiss the nuptial cortège, and agree to whatever was demanded. Sindhia\r\nremained a month in the valley, during which an interview took place\r\nbetween him and the Rana at the shrine of Eklinga [462].[4.17.48]\r\n\r\n=Battle of Parbatsar. Defeat of the Mārwār Forces.=—The heralds of Hymen\r\nbeing thus rudely repulsed and its symbols intercepted, the Jaipur\r\nprince prepared to avenge his insulted pride and disappointed hopes, and\r\naccordingly arrayed a force such as had not assembled since the empire\r\nwas in its glory. Raja Man eagerly took up the gauntlet of his rival,\r\nand headed ‘the swords of Maru.’ But dissension prevailed in Marwar,\r\nwhere rival claimants for the throne had divided the loyalty of the\r\nclans, introducing there also the influence of the Mahrattas. Raja Man,\r\nwho had acquired the sceptre by party aid, was obliged to maintain\r\nhimself by it, and to pursue the demoralizing policy of the period by\r\nranging his vassals against each other. These nuptials gave the\r\nmalcontents an opportunity to display their long-curbed resentments, and\r\nfollowing the example of Mewar, they set up a pretender, whose interests\r\nwere eagerly espoused, and whose standard was erected in the array of\r\nJaipur; the prince at the head of 120,000 men advancing against his\r\nrival, who with less than half the number met him at Parbatsar, on their\r\nmutual frontier. The action was short, for while a heavy cannonade\r\nopened on either side, the majority of the Marwar nobles went over to\r\nthe pretender. Raja Man turned his poniard against himself: but some\r\nchiefs yet faithful to him wrested the weapon from his hand, and\r\nconveyed him from the field. He was pursued to his capital, which was\r\ninvested, besieged, and gallantly defended during six months. The town\r\nwas at length taken and plundered, but the castle of Jodha ‘laughed a\r\nsiege to scorn’; in time with the aid of finesse, the mighty host of\r\nJaipur, which had consumed the forage of these arid plains for twenty\r\nmiles around, began to crumble away; intrigue spread through every rank,\r\nand the siege ended in pusillanimity and flight. The Xerxes of Rajwara,\r\nthe effeminate Kachhwaha, alarmed at length for his personal safety,\r\nsent on the spoils of Parbatsar and Jodhpur to his capital; but the\r\nbrave nobles of Marwar, drawing the line between loyalty and patriotism,\r\nand determined that no trophy of Rathor degradation should be conveyed\r\nby the Kachhwahas from Marwar, attacked the cortège and redeemed the\r\nsymbols of their disgrace. The colossal array of the invader was soon\r\ndismembered, and the ‘lion of the world’ (Jagat Singh), humbled and\r\ncrestfallen [463], skulked from the desert retreat of his rival,\r\nindebted to a partisan corps for safety and convoy to his capital,\r\naround whose walls the wretched remnants of this ill-starred confederacy\r\nlong lagged in expectation of their pay, while the bones of their horses\r\nand the ashes of their riders whitened the plain, and rendered it a\r\nGolgotha.[4.17.49]\r\n\r\n=Nawāb Amīr Khān.=—By the aid of one of the most notorious villains\r\nIndia ever produced, the Nawab Amir Khan,[4.17.50] the pretender’s party\r\nwas treacherously annihilated. This man with his brigade of artillery\r\nand horse was amongst the most efficient of the foes of Raja Man; but\r\nthe _auri sacra fames_ not only made him desert the side on which he\r\ncame for that of the Raja, but for a specific sum offer to rid him of\r\nthe pretender and all his associates. Like Judas, he kissed whom he\r\nbetrayed, took service with the pretender, and at the shrine of a saint\r\nof his own faith exchanged turbans with their leaders; and while the too\r\ncredulous Rajput chieftains celebrated this acquisition to their party\r\nin the very sanctuary of hospitality, crowned by the dance and the song,\r\nthe tents were cut down, and the victims thus enveloped, slaughtered in\r\nthe midst of festivity by showers of grape.\r\n\r\nThus finished the under-plot; but another and more noble victim was\r\ndemanded before discomfited ambition could repose, or the curtain drop\r\non this eventful drama. Neither party would relinquish his claim to the\r\nfair object of the war; and the torch of discord could be extinguished\r\nonly in her blood. To the same ferocious Khan is attributed the\r\nunhallowed suggestion, as well as its compulsory execution. The scene\r\nwas now changed from the desert castle of Jodha to the smiling valley of\r\nUdaipur, soon to be filled with funereal lamentation.\r\n\r\n=The Tragedy of Krishna Kunwāri.=—Krishna Kunwari Bai, the ‘Virgin\r\nPrincess Krishna,’ was in her sixteenth year: her mother was of the\r\nChawara race, the ancient kings of Anhilwara. Sprung from the noblest\r\nblood of Hind, she added beauty of face and person to an engaging\r\ndemeanour, and was justly proclaimed the ‘flower of Rajasthan.’ When the\r\nRoman father pierced the bosom of the dishonoured Virginia, appeased\r\nvirtue applauded the deed. When Iphigenia was led to the sacrificial\r\naltar, the salvation of her country yielded a noble consolation. The\r\nvotive victim of Jephthah’s success had [464] the triumph of a father’s\r\nfame to sustain her resignation, and in the meekness of her sufferings\r\nwe have the best parallel to the sacrifice of the lovely Krishna: though\r\nyears have passed since the barbarous immolation, it is never related\r\nbut with a faltering tongue and moistened eyes, ‘albeit unused to the\r\nmelting mood.’\r\n\r\nThe rapacious and bloodthirsty Pathan, covered with infamy, repaired to\r\nUdaipur, where he was joined by the pliant and subtle Ajit. Meek in his\r\ndemeanour, unostentatious in his habits; despising honours, yet covetous\r\nof power,—religion, which he followed with the zeal of an ascetic, if it\r\ndid not serve as a cloak, was at least no hindrance to an immeasurable\r\nambition, in the attainment of which he would have sacrificed all but\r\nhimself. When the Pathan revealed his design, that either the princess\r\nshould wed Raja Man, or by her death seal the peace of Rajwara, whatever\r\narguments were used to point the alternative, the Rana was made to see\r\nno choice between consigning his beloved child to the Rathor prince, or\r\nwitnessing the effects of a more extended dishonour from the vengeance\r\nof the Pathan, and the storm of his palace by his licentious\r\nadherents—the fiat passed that Krishna Kunwari should die.\r\n\r\nBut the deed was left for women to accomplish—the hand of man refused\r\nit. The Rawala[4.17.51] of an Eastern prince is a world within itself;\r\nit is the labyrinth containing the strings that move the puppets which\r\nalarm mankind. Here intrigue sits enthroned, and hence its influence\r\nradiates to the world, always at a loss to trace effects to their\r\ncauses. Maharaja Daulat Singh,[4.17.52] descended four generations ago\r\nfrom one common ancestor with the Rana, was first sounded ‘to save the\r\nhonour of Udaipur’; but, horror-struck, he exclaimed, “Accursed the\r\ntongue that commands it! Dust on my allegiance, if thus to be\r\npreserved!” The Maharaja Jawandas, a natural brother, was then called\r\nupon; the dire necessity was explained, and it was urged that no common\r\nhand could be armed for the purpose. He accepted the poniard, but when\r\nin youthful loveliness Krishna appeared before him, the dagger fell from\r\nhis hand, and he returned more wretched than the victim. The fatal\r\npurpose thus revealed, the shrieks of the frantic mother reverberated\r\nthrough the palace, as she implored mercy, or execrated the murderers of\r\nher child, who alone was resigned to her fate. But death was arrested,\r\nnot averted [465]. To use the phrase of the narrator, \"she was excused\r\nthe steel—the cup was prepared,\"—and prepared by female hands! As the\r\nmessenger presented it in the name of her father, she bowed and drank\r\nit, sending up a prayer for his life and prosperity. The raving mother\r\npoured imprecations on his head, while the lovely victim, who shed not a\r\ntear, thus endeavoured to console her: “Why afflict yourself, my mother,\r\nat this shortening of the sorrows of life? I fear not to die! Am I not\r\nyour daughter? Why should I fear death? We are marked out for\r\nsacrifice[4.17.53] from our birth; we scarcely enter the world but to be\r\nsent out again; let me thank my father that I have lived so\r\nlong!”[4.17.54] Thus she conversed till the nauseating draught refused\r\nto assimilate with her blood. Again the bitter potion was prepared. She\r\ndrained it off, and again it was rejected; but, as if to try the extreme\r\nof human fortitude, a third was administered; and, for the third time,\r\nNature refused to aid the horrid purpose. It seemed as if the fabled\r\ncharm, which guarded the life of the founder of her race,[4.17.55] was\r\ninherited by the Virgin Krishna. But the blood-hounds, the Pathan and\r\nAjit, were impatient till their victim was at rest; and cruelty, as if\r\ngathering strength from defeat, made another and a fatal attempt. A\r\npowerful opiate was presented—_the kusumbha draught_.[4.17.56] She\r\nreceived it with a smile, wished the scene over, and drank it. The\r\ndesires [466] of barbarity were accomplished. ‘She slept!’[4.17.57] a\r\nsleep from which she never awoke.\r\n\r\nThe wretched mother did not long survive her child; nature was exhausted\r\nin the ravings of despair; she refused food; and her remains in a few\r\ndays followed those of her daughter to the funeral pyre.\r\n\r\nEven the ferocious Khan, when the instrument of his infamy, Ajit,\r\nreported the issue, received him with contempt, and spurned him from his\r\npresence, tauntingly asking “if this were the boasted Rajput valour?”\r\nBut the wily traitor had to encounter language far more bitter from his\r\npolitical adversary, whom he detested. Sangram Saktawat reached the\r\ncapital only four days after the catastrophe—a man in every respect the\r\nreverse of Ajit; audaciously brave, he neither feared the frown of his\r\nsovereign nor the sword of his enemy. Without introduction he rushed\r\ninto the presence, where he found seated the traitor Ajit. “Oh dastard!\r\nwho hast thrown dust on the Sesodia race, whose blood which has flowed\r\nin purity through a hundred ages has now been defiled! this sin will\r\ncheck its course for ever; a blot so foul in our annals that no\r\nSesodia[4.17.58] will ever again hold up his head! A sin to which no\r\npunishment were equal. But the end of our race is approaching! The line\r\nof Bappa Rawal is at an end! Heaven has ordained this, a signal of our\r\ndestruction.” The Rana hid his face with his hands, when turning to\r\nAjit, he exclaimed, \"Thou stain on the Sesodia race, thou impure of\r\nRajput blood, dust be on thy head as thou hast covered us all with\r\nshame. May you die childless, and your name die with you![4.17.59] Why\r\nthis indecent haste? Had the Pathan stormed the city? Had he attempted\r\nto violate the sanctity of the Rawala? And though he had, could you not\r\ndie as Rajputs, like your ancestors? Was it thus they gained a name? Was\r\nit thus our race became renowned—thus they opposed the might of kings?\r\nHave you forgotten the Sakhas of Chitor? But whom do I address—not\r\nRajputs? Had the honour of your females been endangered, had you\r\nsacrificed them all and rushed sword in hand on the enemy, your name\r\nwould have lived, and the Almighty would have secured the seed of Bappa\r\nRawal. But to owe preservation [467] to this unhallowed deed! You did\r\nnot even await the threatened danger. Fear seems to have deprived you of\r\nevery faculty, or you might have spared the blood of Sriji,[4.17.60] and\r\nif you did not scorn to owe your safety to deception, might have\r\nsubstituted some less noble victim! But the end of our race approaches!\"\r\n\r\n=Fate of the Murderers.=—The traitor to manhood, his sovereign, and\r\nhumanity, durst not reply. The brave Sangram is now dead, but the\r\nprophetic anathema has been fulfilled. Of ninety-five children, sons and\r\ndaughters, but one son (the brother of Krishna)[4.17.61] is left to the\r\nRana; and though his two remaining daughters have been recently married\r\nto the princes of Jaisalmer and Bikaner, the Salic law, which is in full\r\nforce in these States, precludes all honour through female descent. His\r\nhopes rest solely on the prince, Javana Singh,[4.17.62] and though in\r\nthe flower of youth and health, the marriage bed (albeit boasting no\r\nless than four young princesses) has been blessed with no\r\nprogeny.[4.17.63]\r\n\r\nThe elder brother of Javana[4.17.64] died two years ago. Had he lived he\r\nwould have been Amra the Third. With regard to Ajit, the curse has been\r\nfully accomplished. Scarcely a month after, his wife and two sons were\r\nnumbered with the dead; and the hoary traitor has since been wandering\r\nfrom shrine to shrine, performing penance and alms in expiation of his\r\nsins, yet unable to fling from him ambition; and with his beads in one\r\nhand, _Rama! Rama!_ ever on his tongue, and subdued passion in his\r\nlooks, his heart is deceitful as ever. Enough of him: let us exclaim\r\nwith Sangram, “Dust on his head,”[4.17.65] which all the waters of the\r\nGanges could not purify from the blood of the virgin Krishna, but\r\n\r\n         rather would the multitudinous sea incarnadine [468].\r\n\r\n=Amīr Khan rewarded by the British.=—His coadjutor, Amir Khan, is now\r\nlinked by treaties “in amity and unity of interests” with the sovereigns\r\nof India; and though he has carried mourning into every house of\r\nRajasthan, yet charity might hope forgiveness would be extended to him,\r\ncould he cleanse himself from this deed of horror—‘throwing this pearl\r\naway, richer than all his tribe!’ His career of rapine has terminated\r\nwith the caresses of the blind goddess, and placed him on a pinnacle to\r\nwhich his sword would never have traced the path. Enjoying the most\r\ndistinguished post amongst the foreign chieftains of Holkar’s State,\r\nhaving the regulars and park under his control, with large estates for\r\ntheir support, he added the epithet of traitor to his other titles, when\r\nthe British Government, adopting the leading maxim of Asiatic policy,\r\n_divide et impera_, guaranteed to him the sovereignty of these districts\r\non his abandoning the Mahrattas, disbanding his legions, and\r\nsurrendering the park. But though he personally fulfilled not, nor could\r\nfulfil, one single stipulation, this man, whose services were not worth\r\nthe pay of a single sepoy—who fled from his camp[4.17.66] unattended,\r\nand sought personal protection in that of the British commander—claimed\r\nand obtained the full price of our pledge, the sovereignty of about\r\none-third of his master’s dominions; and the districts of Sironj, Tonk,\r\nRampura, and Nimbahera, form the domain of the Nawab Amir Khan, etc.,\r\netc., etc.!! This was in the fitful fever of success, when our arms were\r\neverywhere triumphant. But were the viceroy of Hind to summon the forty\r\ntributaries[4.17.67] now covered by the aegis of British protection to a\r\nmeeting, the murderer of Krishna would still occupy a place (though low)\r\nin this illustrious divan. Let us hope that his character being known,\r\nhe would feel himself ill at ease; and let us dismiss him likewise in\r\nthe words of Sangram, “Dust on his head!”\r\n\r\nThe mind sickens at the contemplation of these unvarying scenes of\r\natrocity; but this unhappy State had yet to pass through two more\r\nlustres of aggravated sufferings (to which the author of these annals\r\nwas an eye-witness) before their [469] termination, upon the alliance of\r\nMewar with Britain. From the period of the forcing of the passes, the\r\ndismissal of the Jaipur embassy by Sindhia, and the murder of Krishna\r\nKunwari, the embassy of Britain was in the train of the Mahratta leader,\r\na witness of the evils described—a most painful predicament—when the\r\nhand was stretched out for succour in vain, and the British flag waved\r\nin the centre of desolation, unable to afford protection. But this day\r\nof humiliation is past, thanks to the predatory hordes who goaded us on\r\nto their destruction; although the work was incomplete, a nucleus being\r\nimprudently left in Sindhia for the scattered particles again to form.\r\n\r\n=Ruin of Mewār by the Marāthas.=—In the spring of 1806, when the embassy\r\nentered the once-fertile Mewar, from whose native wealth the monuments\r\nthe pencil will portray were erected, nothing but ruin met the\r\neye—deserted towns, roofless houses, and uncultured plains. Wherever the\r\nMahratta encamped, annihilation was ensured; it was a habit; and\r\ntwenty-four hours sufficed to give to the most flourishing spot the\r\naspect of a desert. The march of destruction was always to be traced for\r\ndays afterwards by burning villages and destroyed cultivation. Some\r\nsatisfaction may result from the fact, that there was scarcely an actor\r\nin these unhallowed scenes whose end was not fitted to his career.\r\nAmbaji was compelled to disgorge the spoils of Mewar, and his personal\r\nsufferings made some atonement for the ills he had inflicted upon her.\r\nThis satrap, who had almost established his independence in the fortress\r\nand territory of Gwalior, suffered every indignity from Sindhia, whose\r\nauthority he had almost thrown off. He was confined in a mean tent,\r\nmanacled, suffered the torture of small lighted torches applied to his\r\nfingers, and even attempted suicide to avoid the surrender of his\r\nriches; but the instrument (an English penknife) was inefficient: the\r\nsurgeon to the British embassy sewed up the wounds, and his coffers were\r\neased of fifty-five lakhs of rupees! Mewar was, however, once more\r\ndelivered over to him; he died shortly after. If report be correct, the\r\nresidue of his treasures was possessed by his ancient ally, Zalim Singh.\r\nIn this case, the old politician derived the chief advantage of the\r\nintrigues of S. 1848, without the crimes attendant on the acquisition.\r\n\r\nSindhia’s father-in-law, when expelled that chief’s camp, according to\r\nthe treaty, enjoyed the ephemeral dignity of minister to the Rana, when\r\nhe abstracted the most valuable records, especially those of the revenue\r\n[470].\r\n\r\nKumbhalmer was obtained by the minister Satidas from Jaswant Rao Bhao\r\nfor seventy thousand rupees, for which assignments were given on this\r\ndistrict, of which he retained possession. Amir Khan in A.D. 1809 led\r\nhis myrmidons to the capital, threatening the demolition of the temple\r\nof Eklinga if refused a contribution of eleven lakhs of rupees. Nine\r\nwere agreed to, but which by no effort could be raised, upon which the\r\nRana’s envoys were treated with indignity, and Kishandas[4.17.68]\r\nwounded. The passes were forced, Amir Khan entering by Debari, and his\r\ncoadjutor and son-in-law, the notorious Jamshid, by the Chirwa, which\r\nmade but a feeble resistance. The ruffian Pathans were billeted on the\r\ncity, subjecting the Rana to personal humiliation, and Jamshid[4.17.69]\r\nleft with his licentious Rohillas in the capital. The traces of their\r\nbarbarity are to be seen in its ruins. No woman could safely venture\r\nabroad, and a decent garment or turban was sufficient to attract their\r\ncupidity.\r\n\r\n=Bāpu Sindhia Sūbahdār of Mewār.=—In S. 1867 (A.D. 1811) Bapu Sindhia\r\narrived with the title of Subahdar, and encamped in the valley, and from\r\nthis to 1814 these vampires, representing Sindhia and Amir Khan,\r\npossessed themselves of the entire fiscal domain, with many of the\r\nfiefs, occasionally disputing for the spoils; to prevent which they came\r\nto a conference at the Dhaula Magra (the white hill), attended by a\r\ndeputation[4.17.70] from the Rana, when the line of demarcation was\r\ndrawn between the spoilers. A schedule was formed of the towns and\r\nvillages yet inhabited, the amount to be levied from each specified, and\r\nthree and a half lakhs adjudged to Jamshid, with the same sum to\r\nSindhia; but this treaty was not better kept than the former ones. Mewar\r\nwas rapidly approaching dissolution, and every sign of civilization fast\r\ndisappearing; fields laid waste, cities in ruins, inhabitants exiled,\r\nchieftains demoralized, the prince and his family destitute of common\r\ncomforts. Yet had Sindhia the audacity to demand compensation for the\r\nloss of his tribute stipulated to Bapu Sindhia [471],[4.17.71] who\r\nrendered Mewar a desert, carrying her chiefs, her merchants, her\r\nfarmers, into captivity and fetters in the dungeons of Ajmer, where many\r\ndied for want of ransom, and others languished till the treaty with the\r\nBritish, in A.D. 1817, set them free.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.1:\r\n\r\n  Brother of Ajit, the negotiator of the treaty with the British.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.2:\r\n\r\n  Chief of the Jagawat clan, also a branch of the Chondawats; he was\r\n  killed in a battle with the Mahrattas.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.3:\r\n\r\n  It is yet held by the successor of Sangram, whose faithful services\r\n  merited the grant he obtained from his prince, and it was in\r\n  consequence left unmolested in the arrangement of 1817, from the\r\n  knowledge of his merits.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.4:\r\n\r\n  The father of Rawat Jawan Singh, whom I found at Udaipur as military\r\n  minister, acting for his grand-uncle Ajit the organ of the Chondawats,\r\n  whose head, Padam Singh, was just emerging from his minority. It was\r\n  absolutely necessary to get to the very root of all these feuds, when\r\n  as envoy and mediator I had to settle the disputes of half a century,\r\n  and make each useful to detect their joint usurpations of the crown\r\n  domain.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.5:\r\n\r\n  She was the grandmother of Man Singh, a fine specimen of a Saktawat\r\n  cavalier.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.6:\r\n\r\n  [Lālsot, about 40 miles south of Jaipur city. For an account of the\r\n  battle see Compton, _European Military Adventurers_, 346 f.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.7:\r\n\r\n  Megh Singh was the chief of Begun, and founder of that subdivision of\r\n  the Chondawats called after him Meghawat, and his complexion being\r\n  very dark (_kala_), he was called ‘Kala Megh,’ the ‘black cloud.’ His\r\n  descendants were very numerous and very refractory.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.8:\r\n\r\n  A.D. 1788.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.9:\r\n\r\n  He did not recover his liberty for two years, nor till he had\r\n  surrendered four of the best towns in his fief.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.10:\r\n\r\n  Father of the present Hamir Singh, the only chief with whom I was\r\n  compelled to use severity; but he was incorrigible. He was celebrated\r\n  for his raids in the troubles, and from his red whiskers bore with us\r\n  the name of the ‘Red Riever’ of Badesar—more of him by and by.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.11:\r\n\r\n  Sheodas and Satidas, with their cousin Jaichand. They revenged their\r\n  brother’s death by that of his murderer, and were both in turn slain.\r\n  Such were these times! The author more than once, when resuming the\r\n  Chondawat lands, and amongst them Badesar, the fief of the son of\r\n  Sardar, was told to recollect the fate of Somji; the advice, however,\r\n  excited only a smile; he was deemed more of a Saktawat than a\r\n  Chondawat, and there was some truth in it, for he found the good\r\n  actions of the former far outweigh the other, who made a boast and\r\n  monopoly of their patriotism. It was a curious period in his life; the\r\n  stimulus to action was too high, too constant, to think of self; and\r\n  having no personal views, being influenced solely by one feeling, the\r\n  prosperity of all, he despised the very idea of danger, though it was\r\n  said to exist in various shapes, even in the hospitable plate put\r\n  before him! But he deemed none capable of such treachery, though once\r\n  he was within a few minutes’ march to the other world; but the cause,\r\n  if the right one, came from his own _cuisinier_, or rather\r\n  _boulanger_, whom he discharged.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.12:\r\n\r\n  See the Essay on a Feudal System.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.13:\r\n\r\n  S. 1847 (A.D. 1791).\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.14:\r\n\r\n  [Count Benoit de Boigne, a Savoyard, born at Chambery, 1751: served\r\n  under Mahādaji Sindhia, and won for him his battles of Pātan and Merta\r\n  in 1790: defeated Holkar at Lakheri in 1793: resigned his command in\r\n  1795, and left India in the next year: died June 21, 1830 (Compton,\r\n  _European Military Adventurers_, 15 ff.; Buckland, _Dict. of Indian\r\n  Biography_, s.v.).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.15:\r\n\r\n  Acquired from the actors in those scenes: the prince, his ministers,\r\n  Zalim Singh and the rival chiefs have all contributed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.16:\r\n\r\n  It was levied as follows:\r\n\r\n           Salumbar                                 Lakhs   3\r\n           Deogarh                                    ”     3\r\n           Singingir Gosain, their adviser            ”     2\r\n           Kosital                                    ”     1\r\n           Amet                                       ”     2\r\n           Kurabar                                    ”     1\r\n                                                            —\r\n                                              Lakhs        12\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.17:\r\n\r\n  [Pāndhri, Pāndharapatti, a tax on shops, artisans, traders, and\r\n  persons not engaged in agriculture, levied on their persons,\r\n  implements, places of work, or traffic; the same as the Mahtarafa\r\n  (Wilson, _Glossary_, s.v.).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.18:\r\n\r\n  Raepur Rajnagar from the Sindis; Gurla and Gadarmala from the\r\n  Purawats; Hamirgarh from Sardar Singh, and Kurj Kawaria from Salumbar.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.19:\r\n\r\n  In Bhadon, the third month of the rainy season.

The\r\n  affairs of Mewar had never prospered since the faithful Pancholis were\r\n  deprived of power. Several productions of the descendants of Biharidas\r\n  have fallen into my hands; their quaint mode of conveying advice may\r\n  authorize their insertion here.\r\n\r\n  The Pancholis, who had performed so many services to the country, had\r\n  been for some time deprived of the office of prime minister, which was\r\n  disposed of as it suited the views of the factious nobles who held\r\n  power for the time being; and who bestowed it on the Mehtas, Depras,\r\n  or Dhabhais. Amongst the papers of the Pancholis, several addressed to\r\n  the Rana and to Agarji Mehta, the minister of the day, are valuable\r\n  for the patriotic sentiments they contain, as well as for the general\r\n  light they throw upon the period. In S. 1853 (A.D. 1797) Amrit Rao\r\n  devised a plan to remedy the evils that oppressed the country. He\r\n  inculcated the necessity of dispensing with the interference of the\r\n  Saktawats and Chondawats in the affairs of government, and\r\n  strengthening the hands of the civil administration by admitting the\r\n  foreign chieftains to the power he proposed to deprive the former of.\r\n  He proceeds in the following quaint style:\r\n\r\n  “Disease fastened on the country from the following causes, envy and\r\n  party spirit. With the Turks disease was introduced; but then the\r\n  prince, his ministers, and chiefs, were of one mind, and medicine was\r\n  ministered and a cure effected. During Rana Jai Singh’s time the\r\n  disorder returned, which his son Amra put down. He recovered the\r\n  affairs of government from confusion, gave to every one his proper\r\n  rank and dignity, and rendered all prosperous. But Maharana Sangram\r\n  Singh put from under his wing the Chandarawat of Rampura, and thus a\r\n  pinion of Mewar was broken. The calamity of Biharidas, whose son\r\n  committed suicide, increased the difficulties. The arrival of the\r\n  Deccanis under Bajirao, the Jaipur affair[4.17.21.A] and the defeat at\r\n  Rajmahall, with the heavy expenditure thereby occasioned, augmented\r\n  the disorder. Add to this in Jagat Singh’s time the enmity of the\r\n  Dhabhais towards the Pancholis, which lowered their dignities at home\r\n  and abroad, and since which time every man has thought himself equal\r\n  to the task of government. Jagat Singh was also afflicted by the\r\n  rebellious conduct of his son Partap, when Shyama Solanki and several\r\n  other chiefs were treacherously cut off. Since which time the minds of\r\n  the nobles have never been loyal, but black and not to be trusted.\r\n  Again, on the accession of Partap, Maharaja Nathji allowed his\r\n  thoughts to aspire, from which all his kin suffered. Hence\r\n  animosities, doubts, and deceits, arose on all sides. Add to this the\r\n  haughty proceeding of Amra Chand now in office; and besides the strife\r\n  of the Pancholis with each other, their enmity to the Depras. Hence\r\n  parties were formed which completely destroyed the credit of all. Yet,\r\n  notwithstanding, they abated none of their strife, which was the acme\r\n  to the disease. The feud between Kuman Singh and the Saktawats for the\r\n  possession of Hintha, aggravated the distresses. The treacherous\r\n  murder of Maharaja Nathji, and the consequent disgust and retreat of\r\n  Jaswant Singh of Deogarh; the setting up the impostor Ratna Singh and\r\n  Jhala Raghudeo’s struggle for office, with Amra Chand’s entertaining\r\n  the mercenaries of Sind, brought it to a crisis. The negligence\r\n  arising out of luxury, and the intrigues of the Dhabhais of Rana Arsi,\r\n  made it spread so as to defeat all attempt at cure. In S. 1829, on the\r\n  treacherous murder of the Rana by the Bundi prince, and the accession\r\n  of the minor Hamir, every one set up his own authority, so that there\r\n  was not even the semblance of government. And now you (to the Rana),\r\n  listening to the advice of Bhim Singh (Salumbar), and his brother,\r\n  Arjun, have taken foreigners[4.17.21.B] into pay, and thus riveted all\r\n  the former errors. You and Sri Baiji Raj (the royal mother), putting\r\n  confidence in foreigners and Deccanis, have rendered the disease\r\n  contagious; besides, your mind is gone. What can be done? Medicine may\r\n  yet be had. Let us unite and struggle to restore the duties of the\r\n  minister and we may conquer, or at least check its progress. If now\r\n  neglected, it will hereafter be beyond human power. The Deccanis are\r\n  the great sore. Let us settle their accounts, and at all events get\r\n  rid of them, or we lose the land for ever. At this time there are\r\n  treaties and engagements in every corner. I have touched on every\r\n  subject. Forgive whatever is improper. Let us look the future in the\r\n  face, and let chiefs, ministers, and all unite. With the welfare of\r\n  the country all will be well. But this is a disease which, if not now\r\n  conquered, will conquer us.”\r\n\r\n  A second paper as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"The disease of the country is to be considered and treated as a\r\n  remittent.\r\n\r\n  \"Amra Singh cured it and laid a complete system of government and\r\n  justice.\r\n\r\n  \"In Sangram’s time it once more gained ground.\r\n\r\n  \"In Jagat Singh’s time the seed was thrown into the ground thus\r\n  obtained.\r\n\r\n  \"In Partap’s time it sprung up.\r\n\r\n  \"In Raj Singh’s time it bore fruit.\r\n\r\n  \"In Rana Arsi’s time it was ripe.\r\n\r\n  \"In Hamir’s time it was distributed, and all have had a share.\r\n\r\n  “And you, Bhim Singh (the present Rana), have eaten plentifully\r\n  thereof. Its virtues and flavour you are acquainted with, and so\r\n  likewise is the country; and if you take no medicine you will\r\n  assuredly suffer much pain, and both at home and abroad you will be\r\n  lightly thought of. Be not therefore negligent, or faith and land will\r\n  depart from you.”\r\n\r\n  A third paper to Agarji Mehta (then minister):\r\n\r\n  \"If the milk is curdled it does not signify. Where there is sense\r\n  butter may yet be extracted; and if the butter-milk (_chhachh_) is\r\n  thrown away it matters not.

It was in this visit that the regal abode of\r\n  this ancient race, its isles and palaces, acted with irresistible\r\n  force on the cupidity of this scion of the plough, who aspired to, yet\r\n  dared not seat himself in, ‘the halls of the Caesars.’ It was even\r\n  surmised that his hostility to Jaipur was not so much from the refused\r\n  war-contribution, as from a mortifying negative to an audacious desire\r\n  to obtain the hand of this princess himself. The impression made on\r\n  the author upon this occasion by the miseries and noble appearance of\r\n  ‘this descendant of a hundred kings,’ was never allowed to weaken, but\r\n  kindled an enthusiastic desire for the restoration of his fallen\r\n  condition, which stimulated his perseverance to obtain that knowledge\r\n  by which alone he might be enabled to benefit him.

The sublime recitations of Handel in ‘Jephtha’s\r\n  Vow,’ the sonorous woe of Sapio’s ‘Deeper and deeper still,’\r\n  powerfully recalled the sad exit of the Rajputni; and the\r\n  representation shortly after of Racine’s tragedy of ‘Iphigénie,’ with\r\n  Talma as Achille, Duchesnois as Clytemnestre, and a very interesting\r\n  personation of the victim daughter of Agamemnon, again served to waken\r\n  the remembrance of this sacrifice.

I\r\n  remained by his bedside during the progress of this terrible\r\n  visitation, and never shall I forget his grateful exclamation of\r\n  surprise, when after a salutary sleep he opened his eyes to health.\r\n  Shirji Mehta, his chief adviser and manager of his estates, merry as\r\n  ever, though the heir of Mewar was given over, was seized with the\r\n  complaint as his master recovered—was dead and his ashes blanching on\r\n  the sands of the streamlet of Ar within twelve hours! Jovial and\r\n  good-humoured as he was, “we could have better spared a better man.”\r\n  He was an adept in intrigue; of Ambaji’s school; and till death shall\r\n  extinguish the whole of this, and better morals are born, the country\r\n  will but slowly improve. [Mahārāna Jawān Singh (1828-38) succeeded on\r\n  the death of his father, Bhīm Singh, on March 31, 1828. He gave\r\n  himself up to debauchery, and died without issue on August 30, 1838,\r\n  being succeeded by his adopted son, Sardār Singh.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.63:\r\n\r\n  Since this work has gone to press, the author has been rejoiced to\r\n  find that an heir has been born from the last marriage by a princess\r\n  of Riwa of the Baghela tribe.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.64:\r\n\r\n  See genealogical descendants of Rana Jagat Singh. Appendix, No. VIII.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.65:\r\n\r\n  This was written at Udaipur in 1820. This old intriguer then attempted\r\n  to renew the past, as the organ of the Chondawats, but his scheme\r\n  ended in exile to the sacred city of Benares; and there he may now be\r\n  seen with his rosary on the consecrated _ghat_ of the Ganges.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.66:\r\n\r\n  Brigadier-General Alexander Knox had the honour of dissolving these\r\n  bands in the only way worthy of us.

Though leagued with the Chondawats, he\r\n  was a loyal subject and good servant. I saw him expire, and was of\r\n  opinion, as well as the doctor who accompanied me, that his death was\r\n  caused by poison. The general burst of sorrow from hundreds collected\r\n  around his house, when the event was announced, is the best encomium\r\n  on his public character.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.69:\r\n\r\n  This monstrous villain (for he was a Goliath) died soon after Mewar\r\n  was rescued, from a cancer in his back.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.70:\r\n\r\n  Satidas, Kishandas, and Rup Ram.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.17.71:\r\n\r\n  Bapu Sindhia shortly outlived his expulsion from Ajmer, and as he had\r\n  to pass through Mewar in his passage to his future residence, he was\r\n  hooted by the population he had plundered. While I was attending the\r\n  Rana’s court, some one reporting Bapu Sindhia’s arrival at his\r\n  destination, mentioned that some pieces of ordnance formerly taken\r\n  from Udaipur had, after saluting him, exuded a quantity of water,\r\n  which was received with the utmost gravity by the court, until I\r\n  remarked they were crying because they should never again be employed\r\n  in plunder: an idea which caused a little mirth.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 18\r\n\r\n\r\n=Degraded Condition of the Rājputs.=—The history of the Rana’s family\r\nhas now been traced through all the vicissitudes of its fortunes, from\r\nthe second to the nineteenth century, whilst contending for existence,\r\nalternately with Parthians, Bhils, Tartars, and Mahrattas, till at\r\nlength it has become tributary to Britain. The last chapter portrays the\r\ndegraded condition of their princes, and the utter desolation of their\r\ncountry, in a picture which embodied the entire Rajput race. An era of\r\nrepose at length dawned upon them. The destruction of that vast\r\npredatory system, under the weight of which the prosperity of these\r\nregions had so long been repressed, was effected by one short campaign\r\nin 1817; which if less brilliant than that of 1803, is inferior to none\r\nin political results. The tardy policy of the last-named period, at\r\nlength accomplished, placed the power of Britain in the East on an\r\nexpugnable position, and rescued the Rajputs from a progressing\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n=Alliances with the British.=—To prevent the recurrence of this\r\npredatory system it was deemed politic to unite all these settled\r\nStates, alike interested with ourselves in its overthrow, in one grand\r\nconfederation. Accordingly the Rajput States were invited to shelter\r\n[472] under our protecting alliance; and with one exception (Jaipur),\r\nthey eagerly embraced the invitation. The ambassadors of the various\r\ngovernments followed each other in quick succession to Delhi, where the\r\ntreaties were to be negotiated, and in a few weeks all Rajputana was\r\nunited to Britain by compacts of one uniform character;[4.18.1] insuring\r\nto them external protection with internal independence, as the price of\r\nacknowledged supremacy, and a portion of revenue to the protecting\r\ngovernment. By this comprehensive arrangement, we placed a most powerful\r\nbarrier between our territories and the strong natural frontier of\r\nIndia; and so long as we shall respect their established usages, and by\r\ncontributing to the prosperity of the people preserve our motives from\r\ndistrust, it will be a barrier impenetrable to invasion.\r\n\r\n=Treaty with Mewār.=—Of all the princes who obtained succour at this\r\nmomentous crisis in the political history of India, none stood more in\r\nneed of it than the Rana of Udaipur. On January 16, 1818, the treaty was\r\nsigned, and in February an envoy was nominated; who immediately\r\nproceeded to the Rana’s court, to superintend and maintain the newly\r\nformed relations.[4.18.2] The right wing of the grand army[4.18.3] had\r\nalready preceded him to compel the surrender of such territory as was\r\nunjustly held by the lawless partisans of Sindhia, and to reduce to\r\nobedience the refractory nobles, to whom anarchy was endeared from long\r\nfamiliarity. The strongholds in the plains as Raepur, Rajnagar, etc.,\r\nsoon surrendered; and the payment of the arrears of the garrison of\r\nKumbhalmer put this important fortress in our possession.\r\n\r\nIn his passage from Jahazpur, which guards the range on the east to\r\nKumbhalmer on the Aravalli west, a space of 140 miles, the limits of\r\nMewar, only two thinly peopled towns were seen which acknowledged the\r\nRana’s authority. All was desolate; even the traces of the footsteps of\r\nman were effaced. The babul (_mimosa_ [_acacia_] _Arabica_), and\r\ngigantic reed, which harboured the boar and the tiger, grew upon the\r\nhighways; and every rising ground displayed a mass of ruin. Bhilwara,\r\nthe commercial _entrepôt_ of Rajputana, which ten years before contained\r\nsix thousand [473] families, showed not a vestige of existence. All was\r\nsilent in her streets—no living thing was seen except a solitary dog,\r\nthat fled in dismay from his lurking-place in the temple, scared at the\r\nunaccustomed sight of man.[4.18.4]\r\n\r\n=Cession of Kumbhalmer.=—An envoy was dispatched by the Rana to\r\ncongratulate the Agent, who joined him in the British camp at Nathdwara;\r\nand while he returned to arrange the formalities of reception, the Agent\r\nobtained the cession of Kumbhalmer; which, with the acquisitions before\r\nmentioned, paved the way for a joyful reception. The prince, Javan\r\nSingh, with all the State insignia, and a numerous cortège, advanced to\r\nreceive the mission, and conduct it to the capital. A spot was fixed on\r\nin a grove of palmyras, about two miles from the city, where carpets\r\nwere spread, and where the prince received the Agent and suite in a\r\nmanner at once courteous and dignified.[4.18.5] Of him it might have\r\nbeen said, in the language applied by Jahangir to the son of Rana\r\nAmra—“His countenance carried the impression of his illustrious\r\nextraction.”\r\n\r\n=Arrival of the Author as Agent.=—We entered the city[4.18.6] by the\r\ngate of the sun; and through a vista of ruin the mission was inducted\r\ninto its future residence, once the abode of the fair Rampiyari.[4.18.7]\r\nLike all the mansions of Rajputana, it was a quadrangular pile, with an\r\nopen paved area, the suites of apartments carried round the sides, with\r\nlatticed or open corridors extending parallel to each suite. Another\r\ndeputation with the _mehmani_, consisting of a hundred trays of\r\nsweetmeats, dried fruits, and a purse of one thousand rupees for\r\ndistribution amongst the domestics, brought the Rana’s welcome upon our\r\narrival in his capital, and fixed the next day for our introduction at\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nAt four in the afternoon, a deputation, consisting of the officiating\r\nprime minister, the representative of the Chondawats, with mace-bearers\r\nand a numerous escort, came to announce the Rana’s readiness to receive\r\nthe mission; which, with all the ‘pomp and circumstance’ peculiar to\r\nthese countries, was marshalled in front of the residency, thronged by\r\ncrowds of well-dressed [474] inhabitants, silently gazing at the unusual\r\nsight.[4.18.8] The grand Nakkaras having announced the Rana in court,\r\nthe mission proceeded through streets which everywhere presented marks\r\nof rapine, hailed by the most enthusiastic greetings. “Jai! jai! Farangi\r\nka Raj!” “Victory, victory to the English Government!” resounded from\r\nevery tongue. The bards were not idle; and the unpoetic name of the\r\nAgent was hitched into rhyme. Groups of musicians were posted here and\r\nthere, who gave a passing specimen of the _tappas_[4.18.9] of Mewar; and\r\nnot a few of the fair, with brazen ewers of water on their heads,\r\nwelcomed us with the _suhelia_, or songs of joy. Into each of these\r\nvessels the purse-bearer dropped a piece of silver; for neither the\r\nsongs of the suhelia, the tappas of the minstrel, nor encomiastic stave\r\nof the bard, are to be received without some acknowledgement that you\r\nappreciate their merit and talents, however you may doubt the value they\r\nput upon your own. As we ascended the main street leading to the\r\nTripolia, or triple portal, which guards the sacred enclosure, dense\r\nmasses of people obstructed our progress, and even the walls of the\r\ntemple of Jagannath were crowded. According to etiquette, we dismounted\r\nat the Porte, and proceeded on foot across the ample terrace; on which\r\nwere drawn up a few elephants and horse, exercising for the Rana’s\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n=The Palace at Udaipur.=—The palace is a most imposing pile, of a\r\nregular form, built of granite and marble, rising at least a hundred\r\nfeet from the ground, and flanked with octagonal towers, crowned with\r\ncupolas. Although built at various periods, uniformity of design has\r\nbeen very well preserved; nor is there in the East a more striking or\r\nmajestic structure. It stands upon the very crest of a ridge running\r\nparallel to, but considerably elevated above, the margin of the lake.\r\nThe terrace, which is at the east and chief front of the palace, extends\r\nthroughout its length, and is supported by a triple row of arches from\r\nthe declivity of the ridge. The height of this arcaded wall is fully\r\nfifty feet; and although all is hollow beneath, yet so admirably is it\r\nconstructed, that an entire range of stables is built on the extreme\r\nverge of the terrace, on which the whole personal force of the Rana,\r\nelephants, horse, and foot, are often assembled. From this terrace the\r\ncity and the valley lay before the spectator, whose vision is bounded\r\nonly by the [475] hills shutting out the plains; while from the summit\r\nof the palace nothing obstructs its range over lake and mountain.\r\n\r\nA band of Sindis guarded the first entrance to the palace; and being\r\nSaturday, the Saktawats were on duty in the great hall of assembly.\r\nThrough lines of Rajputs we proceeded till we came to the marble\r\nstaircase, the steps of which had taken the form of the segment of an\r\nellipse, from the constant friction of the foot; an image of Ganesha\r\nguarded the ascent to the interior of the palace, and the apartment, or\r\nlanding, is called Ganesha deori, from the Rajput Janus. After\r\nproceeding through a suite of saloons, each filled with spectators, the\r\nherald’s voice announced to ‘the lord of the world’ that the English\r\nenvoy was in his presence; on which he arose, and advanced a few paces\r\nin front of the throne, the chieftains standing to receive the mission.\r\nEverything being ruled by precedent, the seat allotted for the envoy was\r\nimmediately in front and touching the royal cushion (_gaddi_): being\r\nthat assigned to the Peshwa in the height of Mahratta prosperity, the\r\narrangement, which was a subject of regular negotiation, could not be\r\nobjected to. The apartment chosen for the initiatory visit was the Surya\r\nmahall, or ‘hall of the sun,’ so called from a medallion of the orb in\r\nbasso-rilievo which decorates the wall. Close thereto is placed the\r\nRana’s throne, above which, supported by slender silver columns, rises a\r\nvelvet canopy. The Gaddi, or throne, in the East is but a huge cushion,\r\nover which is thrown an embroidered velvet mantle. The chiefs of the\r\nhigher grade, or ‘the Sixteen,’ were seated, according to their rank, on\r\nthe right and left of the Rana; next and below these were the princes\r\nAmra and Javan Singh; and at right angles (by which the court formed\r\nthree sides of a square), the chiefs of the second rank. The civil\r\nofficers of the State were near the Rana in front, and the seneschal,\r\nbutler, keeper of the wardrobe, and other confidential officers and\r\ninferior chieftains, formed a group standing on the extreme edge of the\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\nThe Rana’s congratulations were hearty and sincere: in a few powerful\r\nexpressions he depicted the miseries he had experienced, the fallen\r\ncondition of his State, and the gratitude he felt to the British\r\nGovernment which had interposed between him and destruction; and which\r\nfor the first moment of his existence allowed him to sleep in peace.\r\nThere was an intense earnestness in every word he uttered, which,\r\ndelivered with great fluency of speech and dignity of manner, inspired\r\ndeep respect and sympathy. The Agent said that the Governor-General was\r\nno stranger to the [476] history of his illustrious family, or to his\r\nown immediate sufferings; and that it was his earnest desire to promote,\r\nby every means in his power, the Rana’s personal dignity and the\r\nprosperity of his dominions. After conversing a few minutes, the\r\ninterview was closed with presents to the Agent and suite: to the former\r\na caparisoned elephant and horse, jewelled aigrette, and pearl necklace,\r\nwith shawls and brocades; and with the customary presentation of essence\r\nof rose and the pan leaf the Rana and court rising, the envoy made his\r\nsalaam and retired. In a short time the Rana, attended by his second\r\nson, ministers, and a select number of the chiefs, honoured the envoy\r\nwith a visit. The latter advanced beyond his residence to meet the\r\nprince, who was received with presented arms by the guard, the officers\r\nsaluting, and conducted to his throne, which had been previously\r\narranged. Conversation was now unrestrained, and questions were demanded\r\nregarding everything which appeared unusual. After sitting half an hour,\r\nthe Agent presented the Rana with an elephant and two horses,\r\ncaparisoned with silver and gilt ornaments and velvet embroidered\r\nhousings, with twenty-one shields[4.18.10] of shawls, brocades, muslins,\r\nand jewels; to prince Amra, unable from sickness to attend his father, a\r\nhorse and eleven shields; and to his brother, the second prince, Javan\r\nSingh, a horse and nine shields; to the ministers and chiefs according\r\nto rank: the whole entertainment costing about 20,000 rupees, or £2000.\r\nAmidst these ceremonials, receiving and returning visits of the Rana,\r\nhis chiefs, his ministers, and men of influence and information\r\ncommercial and agricultural, some weeks passed in silent observation,\r\nand in the acquisition of materials for action.[4.18.11]\r\n\r\n=Political Divisions of Mewār.=—For the better comprehension of the\r\ninternal relations, past and present, of Mewar [477], a sketch is\r\npresented, showing the political divisions of the tribes and the fiscal\r\ndomain, from which a better idea may be formed of Rajput feudal economy\r\nthan from a chapter of dissertation. The princes of Mewar skilfully\r\navailed themselves of their natural advantages in the partition of the\r\ncountry. The mountain-barriers east and west were allotted to the chiefs\r\nto keep the mountaineers and foresters in subjection, whose leading\r\npasses were held by a lord-marcher, and the quotas of his quarter; and\r\nwhile strong forts guarded the exposed northern and southern entrances,\r\nthe crown-land lay in the centre, the safest and the richest. The\r\nexterior, thus guarded by a cordon of feudal levies composed of the\r\nquotas of the greater fiefs; the minor and most numerous class of\r\nvassals, termed _gol_, literally ‘the mass,’ and consisting of ten\r\nthousand horse, each holding directly of the crown independent of the\r\ngreater chiefs, formed its best security against both external\r\naggression and internal commotions.\r\n\r\n=Desolation of Mewār.=—Such is a picture of the feudal economy of Mewar\r\nin the days of her renown; but so much had it been defaced through time\r\nand accident, that with difficulty could the lineaments be traced with a\r\nview to their restoration: her institutions a dead letter, the prince’s\r\nauthority despised, the nobles demoralized and rebellious, internal\r\ncommerce abandoned, and the peasantry destroyed by the combined\r\noperation of war, pestilence, and exile. Expression might be racked for\r\nphrases which could adequately delineate the miseries all classes had\r\nendured. It is impossible to give more than a sketch of the state of the\r\n_das sahas Mewar_, ‘the ten thousand townships’ which once acknowledged\r\nher princes, and of which above three thousand still exist. All that\r\nremained to them was the valley of the capital; and though Chitor and\r\nMandalgarh were maintained by the fidelity of the Rana’s servants, their\r\nprecarious revenues scarcely sufficed to maintain their garrisons. The\r\nRana was mainly indebted to Zalim Singh of Kotah for the means of\r\nsubsistence; for in the struggle for existence his chiefs thought only\r\nof themselves, of defending their own estates, or buying off their foes;\r\nwhile those who had succumbed took to horse, scoured the country, and\r\nplundered without distinction. Inferior clanships declared themselves\r\nindependent of their superiors, who in their turn usurped the crown\r\ndomain, or by bribing the necessities of their prince, obtained his\r\npatent for lands, to which, as they yielded him nothing, he became\r\nindifferent. The crown-tenants purchased of these chiefs the protection\r\n(_rakhwali_) which the [478] Rana could not grant, and made alienations\r\nof the crown taxes, besides private rights of the community, which were\r\noften extorted at the point of the lance. Feuds multiplied, and the name\r\nof each clan became the watchword of alarm or defiance to its neighbour:\r\ncastles were assaulted, and their inmates, as at Sheogarh and Lawa, put\r\nto the sword; the Meras and Bhils descended from their hills, or emerged\r\nfrom their forests, and planted ambuscades for the traveller or\r\nmerchant, whom they robbed or carried to their retreats, where they\r\nlanguished in durance till ransomed. Marriage processions were thus\r\nintercepted, and the honeymoon was passed on a cliff of the Aravalli, or\r\nin the forests on the Mahi. The Rajput, whose moral energies were\r\nblunted, scrupled not to associate and to divide the spoil with these\r\nlawless tribes, of whom it might be said, as of the children of Ishmael,\r\n“Their hands were against every man, and every man’s hand against them.”\r\nYet notwithstanding such entire disorganization of society, external\r\ncommerce was not stagnant; and in the midst of this rapine, the produce\r\nof Europe and Kashmir would pass each other in transit through Mewar,\r\nloaded it is true by a multiplicity of exactions, but guarded by those\r\nwho scorned all law but the point of honour, which they were paid for\r\npreserving.\r\n\r\n=The Condition of Udaipur.=—The capital will serve as a specimen of the\r\ncountry. Udaipur, which formerly reckoned fifty thousand houses within\r\nthe walls, had not now three thousand occupied, the rest were in ruin,\r\nthe rafters being taken for firewood. The realization of the spring\r\nharvest of 1818, from the entire fiscal land, was about £4000! Grain\r\nsold for seven sers the rupee, though thrice the quantity was procurable\r\nwithin the distance of eighty miles. Insurance from the capital to\r\nNathdwara (twenty-five miles) was eight per cent. The Kotharia chief,\r\nwhose ancestors are immortalized for fidelity, had not a horse to\r\nconduct him to his prince’s presence, though his estates were of fifty\r\nthousand rupees annual value. All were in ruins; and the Rana, the\r\ndescendant of those patriot Rajputs who opposed Babur, Akbar, and\r\nAurangzeb, in the days of Mogul splendour, had not fifty horse to attend\r\nhim, and was indebted for all the comforts he possessed to the\r\nliberality of Kotah.\r\n\r\n=Reorganization of the State.=—Such was the chaos from which order was\r\nto be evoked. But the elements of prosperity, though scattered, were not\r\nextinct; and recollections of the past, deeply engraved in the national\r\nmind, became available to reanimate their moral and physical existence.\r\nTo call these forth demanded only the exertion of moral [479]\r\ninterference, and every other was rejected. The lawless freebooter, and\r\neven the savage Bhil, felt awed at the agency of a power never seen. To\r\nhim moral opinion (compared with which the strength of armies is nought)\r\nwas inexplicable, and he substituted in its stead another invisible\r\npower—that of magic: and the belief was current throughout the intricate\r\nregion of the West, that a single individual could carry an army in his\r\npocket, and that our power could animate slips of paper cut into the\r\nfigures of armed men, from which no precaution could guard their\r\nretreats. Accordingly, at the mere name of the British power, rapine\r\nceased, and the inhabitants of the wilds of the West, the ‘forest\r\nlords,’ who had hitherto laughed at subjection, to the number of seven\r\nhundred villages, put each the sign of the dagger to a treaty, promising\r\nabstinence from plunder and a return to industrious life—a single\r\nindividual of no rank the negotiator. Moreover, the treaty was\r\nreligiously kept for twelve months; when the peace was broken, not by\r\nthem, but against them.\r\n\r\nTo the Rajput, the moral spectacle of a Peshwa marched into exile with\r\nall the quietude of a pilgrimage, effected more than twenty thousand\r\nbayonets, and no other auxiliary was required than the judicious use of\r\nthe impressions from this and other passing events, to relay the\r\nfoundations of order and prosperity—by never doubting the issue, success\r\nwas insured. The British force, therefore, after the reduction of the\r\nplans enumerated, was marched to cantonments; the rest was left for time\r\nand reason to accomplish.\r\n\r\n=Form of Civil Government.=—Before proceeding further, it may be\r\nconvenient to sketch the form of civil government in Mewar, and the\r\ncharacters of its most conspicuous members: the former we shall describe\r\nas it was when the machine was in regular action; it will be found\r\nsimple, and perfectly suited to its object.\r\n\r\nThere are four grand officers of the government:\r\n\r\n 1. The Pardhan, or prime minister.\r\n 2. Bakhshi, commander of the forces.\r\n 3. Suratnama, keeper of the records.\r\n 4. Sahai, keeper of the signet.[4.18.12]\r\n\r\nThe first, the Pardhan, or civil premier, must be of the non-militant\r\ntribe. The whole of the territorial and financial arrangements are\r\nvested in him. He [480] nominates the civil governors of districts, and\r\nthe collectors of the revenue and custom; and has fourteen _thuas_, or\r\ndepartments, under him, which embrace all that relates to expenditure.\r\n\r\n2. The Bakhshi must also be of a non-militant tribe, and one different\r\nfrom the Pardhan. His duties are mixed civil and military. He takes the\r\nmusters, and pays mercenaries, or rations, to the feudal tenants when on\r\nextra service, and he appoints a deputy to accompany all expeditions, or\r\nto head frontier-posts, with the title of Faujdar, or commander. The\r\nroyal insignia, the standard, and kettle-drums accompany him, and the\r\nhighest nobles assemble under the general control of this civil officer,\r\nnever under one of their own body. From the Bakhshi’s bureau all patents\r\nare issued, as also all letters of sequestration of feudal land.\r\n\r\nThe Bakhshi has four secretaries:\r\n\r\n          1. Draws out deeds.\r\n          2. Accountant.\r\n          3. Recorder of all patents or grants.\r\n          4. Keeps duplicates.\r\n\r\n3. The Suratnama[4.18.13] is the auditor and recorder of all the\r\nhousehold expenditure and establishments, which are paid by his cheques.\r\nHe has four assistants also, who make a daily report, and give a daily\r\nbalance of accounts.\r\n\r\n4. The Sahai. He is secretary both for home and foreign correspondence.\r\nHe draws out the royal grants or patents of estates, and superintends\r\nthe deeds of grant on copper-plate to religious establishments. Since\r\nthe privilege appertaining to Salumbar, of confirming all royal grants\r\nwith his signet the lance, has fallen into desuetude, the Sahai executes\r\nthis military autograph.[4.18.14]\r\n\r\nTo all decrees, from the daily stipend to the _patta_, or patent of an\r\nestate, each minister must append his seal, so that there is a complete\r\nsystem of check. Besides these, the higher officers of government, there\r\nare thirty-six _karkhanas_, or inferior officers, appointed directly by\r\nthe Rana, the most conspicuous of which are the justiciary,[4.18.15] the\r\nkeepers of the register-office, of the mint, of the armoury, of the\r\nregalia, of the jewels, of the wardrobe, of the stables, of the kitchen,\r\nof the band, of the seneschalsy, and of the seraglio.\r\n\r\nThere was no want of aspirants to office, here hereditary; but it was\r\nvain to look [481] amongst the descendants of the virtuous Pancholi, or\r\nthe severe Amrachand, and the prediction of the former, “Dust will cover\r\nthe head of Mewar when virtue wanders in rags,” was strictly fulfilled.\r\nThere appeared no talent, no influence, no honesty; yet the deficiency\r\nwas calculated to excite sorrow rather than surprise; to stimulate\r\nexertion on their behalf, rather than damp the hope of improvement;\r\nthough all scope for action, save in the field of intrigue, was lost,\r\nand talent was dormant for want of exercise.\r\n\r\n=Incapacity of the Rāna.=—The Rana’s character was little calculated to\r\nsupply his minister’s deficiencies. Though perfectly versed in the past\r\nhistory of his country, its resources, and their management; though\r\nable, wise, and amiable, his talents were nullified by numerous weak\r\npoints. Vain shows, frivolous amusements, and an ill-regulated\r\nliberality alone occupied him; and so long as he could gratify these\r\npropensities, he trusted complacently to the exertions of others for the\r\nrestoration of order and his proper authority. He had little steadiness\r\nof purpose, and was particularly obnoxious to female influence. It is\r\nscarcely to be wondered that he coveted repose, and was little desirous\r\nto disturb the only moment his existence had presented of enjoying it,\r\nby inviting the turmoils of business. No man, however, was more capable\r\nof advising: his judgment was good, but he seldom followed its dictates;\r\nin short, he was an adept in theory, and a novice in practice. The only\r\nman about the court at once of integrity and efficiency was Kishandas,\r\nwho had long acted as ambassador, and to whose assiduity the sovereign\r\nand the country owed much; but his services were soon cut off by death.\r\n\r\nSuch were the materials with which the work of reform commenced. The aim\r\nwas to bring back matters to a correspondence with an era of their\r\nhistory, when the rights of the prince, the vassal, and the cultivator,\r\nwere alike well defined—that of Amra Singh.\r\n\r\n=Relations of the Rāna with his Nobles.=—The first point to effect was\r\nthe recognition of the prince’s authority by his nobles; the surest sign\r\nof which was their presence at the capital, where some had never been,\r\nand others only when it suited their convenience or their views. In a\r\nfew weeks the Rana saw himself surrounded by a court such as had not\r\nbeen known for half a century. It created no small curiosity to learn by\r\nwhat secret power they were brought into each other’s presence. Even the\r\nlawless Hamira, who but a short while before had plundered the marriage\r\ndower of the Hari queen [482] coming from Kotah, and the chief of the\r\nSangawat clan, who had sworn “he might bend his head to woman, but never\r\nto his sovereign,” left their castles of Badesar and Deogarh, and\r\n“placing the royal rescript on their heads,” hastened to his presence;\r\nand in a few weeks the whole feudal association of Mewar was embodied in\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\n=Return of the Exiles.=—To recall the exiled population was a measure\r\nsimultaneous with the assembling of the nobles; but this was a work\r\nrequiring time: they had formed ties, and incurred obligations to the\r\nsocieties which had sheltered them, which could not at once be\r\ndisengaged or annulled. But wherever a subject of Mewar existed,\r\nproclamations penetrated, and satisfactory assurances were obtained, and\r\nrealized to an extent which belied in the strongest manner the assertion\r\nthat patriotism is unknown to the natives of Hindustan. The most\r\nenthusiastic and cheering proofs were afforded that neither oppression\r\nfrom without, nor tyranny within, could expel the feeling for the\r\n_bapota_, the land of their fathers. Even now, though time has chastened\r\nthe impressions, we should fear to pen but a tithe of the proofs of\r\ndevotion of the husbandman of Mewar to the _solum natale_: it would be\r\ndeemed romance by those who never contemplated humanity in its reflux\r\nfrom misery and despair to the ‘sweet influences’ of hope; he alone who\r\nhad witnessed the day of trouble, and beheld the progress of\r\ndesolation—the standing corn grazed by Mahratta horse—the rifled towns\r\ndevoted to the flames—the cattle driven to the camp, and the chief men\r\nseized as hostages for money never to be realized—could appreciate their\r\ndeliverance. To be permitted to see these evils banished, to behold the\r\nsurvivors of oppression congregated from the most distant provinces,\r\nmany of them strangers to each other, and the aged and the helpless\r\nawaiting the lucky day to take possession of their ruined abodes, was a\r\nsight which memory will not part with. Thus on the 3rd of Sawan\r\n(July),[4.18.16] a favourite day with the husbandman, three hundred of\r\nall conditions, with their waggons and implements of labour, and\r\npreceded by banners and music, marched into Kapasan;[4.18.17] and\r\nGanesha was once again invoked as they reconsecrated their dwellings,\r\nand placed his portrait as the Janus of the portals. On the same day,\r\nand within eight months subsequent to the signature of the treaty, above\r\nthree hundred towns and villages were simultaneously reinhabited; and\r\nthe land, which for many years had been a stranger to the plough-share,\r\nwas broken up. Well might [483] the superstitious fancy that miracles\r\nwere abroad; for even to those who beheld the work in progression it had\r\na magical result, to see the waste covered with habitations, and the\r\nverdant corn growing in the fields where lately they had roused the boar\r\nfrom his retreat! It was a day of pride for Britain! By such exertions\r\nof her power in these distant lands her sway is hallowed. By Britain\r\nalone can this fair picture be defaced; the tranquillity and\r\nindependence she has conferred, by her alone may be disturbed!\r\n\r\n=Attraction of Capital.=—To these important preliminary measures, the\r\nassembly of the nobles and recall of the population, was added a third,\r\nwithout which the former would have been nugatory. There was no wealth,\r\nno capital, to aid their patriotism and industry. Foreign merchants and\r\nbankers had abandoned the devoted land; and those who belonged to it\r\npartook of her poverty and her shame. Money was scarce, and want of\r\nfaith and credit had increased the usury on loans to a ruinous extent.\r\nThe Rana borrowed at thirty-six per cent; besides twenty-five to forty\r\nper cent discount for his _barats_, or patents empowering collection on\r\nthe land; a system pursued for some time even after his restoration to\r\nauthority. His profusion exceeded even the rapidity of renovation; and\r\nthe husbandman had scarcely broken up his long-waste fields, when a call\r\nwas made by the harpies of the State for an advance on their produce,\r\nwhile he himself had been compelled to borrow at a like ruinous rate for\r\nseed and the means of support, to be paid by expectations. To have hoped\r\nfor the revival of prosperity amidst such destitution, moral and\r\npecuniary, would have been visionary. It was as necessary to improve the\r\none as to find the other; for poverty and virtue do not long associate,\r\nand certainly not in Mewar. Proclamations were therefore prepared by the\r\nRana, inviting foreign merchants and bankers to establish connexions in\r\nthe chief towns throughout the country; but as in the days of\r\ndemoralization little faith was placed in the words of princes, similar\r\nones were prepared by the Agent, guaranteeing the stipulations, and both\r\nwere distributed to every commercial city in India. The result was as\r\nhad been foreseen: branch banks were everywhere formed, and mercantile\r\nagents fixed in every town in the country, whose operations were only\r\nlimited by the slow growth of moral improvement. The shackles which\r\nbound external commerce were at once removed, and the multifarious posts\r\nfor the collections of transit duties abolished; in lieu of which chain\r\nof stations, all levies on goods in transit were confined to the\r\nfrontiers. The scale of duties [484] was revised; and by the abolition\r\nof intermediate posts, they underwent a reduction of from thirty to\r\nfifty per cent. By this system, which could not for some time be\r\ncomprehended, the transit and custom duties of Mewar made the most\r\ncertain part of the revenue, and in a few years exceeded in amount what\r\nhad ever been known.\r\n\r\n=Trade at Bhīlwāra.=—The chief commercial mart, Bhilwara, which showed\r\nnot a vestige of humanity, rapidly rose from ruin, and in a few months\r\ncontained twelve hundred houses, half of which were occupied by foreign\r\nmerchants. Bales of goods, the produce of the most distant lands, were\r\npiled up in the streets lately overgrown with grass, and a weekly fair\r\nwas established for the home manufactures. A charter of privileges and\r\nimmunities was issued, exempting them from all taxation for the first\r\nyear, and graduating the scale for the future; calculated with the same\r\nregard to improvement, by giving the mind the full range of enjoying the\r\nreward of its exertions. The right of electing their own chief\r\nmagistrates and the assessors of justice, was above all things\r\nindispensable, so as to render them as independent as possible of the\r\nneedy servants of the court. A guard was provided by the government for\r\ntheir protection, and a competent authority nominated to see that the\r\nfull extent of their privileges, and the utmost freedom of action, were\r\nreligiously maintained. The entire success of this plan may at once be\r\nrecorded to prevent repetition. In 1822, Bhilwara contained nearly three\r\nthousand dwellings, which were chiefly inhabited by merchants, bankers,\r\nor artisans. An entire new street had been constructed in the centre of\r\nthe town, from the duties levied, and the shops and houses were rented\r\nat a moderate rate; while many were given up to the proprietors of their\r\nsites, returning from exile, on their paying the price of construction.\r\nBut as there is no happiness without alloy, so even this pleasing\r\npicture had its dark shades to chasten the too sanguine expectation of\r\nimparting happiness to all. Instead of a generous emulation, a jealous\r\ncompetition checked the prosperity of Bhilwara: the base spirit of\r\nexclusive monopoly desired a distinction between the native and the\r\nstranger-merchant, for which they had a precedent in the latter paying\r\nan addition to the town-duty of metage (_mapa_). The unreasonableness of\r\nthis was discussed, and it was shown to be more consonant to justice\r\nthat he who came from Jaisalmer, Surat, Benares, or Delhi, should pay\r\nless than the merchant whose domicile was on the spot. When at length\r\nthe parties acquiesced in this opinion, and were intreated and promised\r\nto know [485] none other distinction than that of ‘inhabitant of\r\nBhilwara,’ sectarian differences, which there was less hope of\r\nreconciling, became the cause of disunion. All the Hindu merchants\r\nbelong either to the Vaishnava or Jain sects; consequently each had a\r\nrepresentative head, and ‘the Five’ for the adjudication of their\r\ninternal arrangements; and these, the wise men of both parties, formed\r\nthe general council for the affairs of Bhilwara. But they carried their\r\nreligious differences to the judgement-seat, where each desired\r\npre-eminence. Whether the point in dispute hinged on the interpretation\r\nof law, which with all these sects is of divine origin, or whether the\r\nmammon of unrighteousness was the lurking cause of their bickerings,\r\nthey assuredly did much harm, for their appeals brought into play what\r\nof all things was least desired, the intrigues of the profligate\r\ndependents of the court. It will be seen hereafter,[4.18.18] in visits\r\nto Bhilwara, how these disputes were in some degree calmed. The leaders\r\non both sides were distinctly given to understand they would be made to\r\nleave the place. Self-interest prevented this extremity; but from the\r\nwithdrawing of that active interference (which the state of the alliance\r\ndid not indeed warrant, but which humanity interposed for their benefit)\r\ntogether with the effect of appeals to the court, it is to be\r\napprehended that Bhilwara may fail to become what it was intended to be,\r\nthe chief commercial mart of Central India.[4.18.19]\r\n\r\n=Reform of the Nobility.=—Of the three measures simultaneously projected\r\nand pursued for the restoration of prosperity, the industrious portion\r\nhas been described. The feudal interest remains, which was found the\r\nmost difficult to arrange. The agricultural and commercial classes\r\nrequired only protection and stimulus, and we could repay the benefits\r\ntheir industry conferred by the lowest scale of taxation, which, though\r\nin fact equally beneficial to the government, was constructed as a boon.\r\nBut with the feudal lords there was no such equivalent to offer in\r\nreturn for the sacrifices many had to make for the re-establishment of\r\nsociety. Those who were well inclined, like Kotharia, had everything to\r\ngain, and nothing left to surrender; while those who, like Deogarh,\r\nSalumbar, or Badnor, had preserved their power by foreign aid, intrigue,\r\nor prowess, dreaded the high price they might be called upon to pay\r\n[486] for the benefit of security which the new alliance conferred. All\r\ndreaded the word ‘restitution,’ and the audit of half a century’s\r\npolitical accounts; yet the adjustment of these was the corner-stone of\r\nthe edifice, which anarchy and oppression had dismantled. Feuds were to\r\nbe appeased, a difficult and hazardous task; and usurpations, both on\r\nthe crown and each other, to be redeemed. ‘To bring the wolf and the\r\ngoat to drink from the same vessel,’ was a task of less difficulty than\r\nto make the Chondawat and Saktawat labour in concert for the welfare of\r\nthe prince and the country. In fine, a better idea cannot be afforded of\r\nwhat was deemed the hopelessness of success than the opinion of Zorawar\r\nSingh, the chief of the latter clan, who had much to relinquish: “Were\r\nParameswara (the Almighty) to descend, he could not reform Mewar.” We\r\njudged better of them than they did of each other.\r\n\r\n=Negotiations with the Chiefs.=—It were superfluous to detail all the\r\npreparatory measures for the accomplishment of this grand object; the\r\nmeetings and adjournments, which only served to keep alive discontent.\r\nOn the 27th of April, the treaty with the British Government was read,\r\nand the consequent change in their relations explained. Meanwhile, a\r\ncharter, defining the respective rights of the crown and of the chiefs,\r\nwith their duties to the community, was prepared, and a day named for a\r\ngeneral assembly of the chieftains to sanction and ratify this\r\nengagement. The 1st of May was fixed: the chiefs assembled; the\r\narticles, ten in number, were read and warmly discussed; when with\r\nunmeaning expressions of duty, and objections to the least prominent,\r\nthey obtained through their speaker, Gokuldas of Deogarh, permission to\r\nreassemble at his house to consider them, and broke up with the promise\r\nto attend next day. The delay, as apprehended, only generated\r\nopposition, and the 2nd and 3rd passed in inter-communications of\r\nindividual hope and fear. It was important to put an end to speculation.\r\nAt noon, on the 4th of May, the grand hall was again filled, when the\r\nRana, with his sons and ministers, took their seats. Once more the\r\narticles were read, objections raised and combated, and midnight had\r\narrived without the object of the meeting being advanced, when an\r\nadjournment, proposed by Gokuldas, till the arrival of the Rana’s\r\nplenipotentiary from Delhi, met with a firm denial; and the Rana gave\r\nhim liberty to retire, if he refused his testimony of loyalty. The Begun\r\nchief, who had much to gain, at length set the example, followed by the\r\nchiefs of Amet and Deogarh, and in succession by all the sixteen nobles,\r\nwho also signed as the proxies of their [487] relatives, unable from\r\nsickness to attend. The most powerful of the second grade also signed\r\nfor themselves and the absent of their clans, each, as he gave in his\r\nadhesion, retiring; and it was three in the morning of the 5th of May\r\nere the ceremony was over. The chief of the Saktawats, determined to be\r\nconspicuous, was the last of his own class to sign. During this\r\nlengthened and painful discussion of fifteen hours’ continuance, the\r\nRana conducted himself with such judgment and firmness, as to give\r\nsanguine hopes of his taking the lead in the settlement of his affairs.\r\n\r\n=Enforcement of the Treaty.=—This preliminary adjusted, it was important\r\nthat the stipulations of the treaty[4.18.20] should be rigidly if not\r\nrapidly effected. It will not be a matter of surprise, that some months\r\npassed away before the complicated arrangements arising out of this\r\nsettlement were completed; but it may afford just grounds for\r\ngratulation, that they were finally accomplished without a shot being\r\nfired, or the exhibition of a single British soldier in the country,\r\nnor, indeed, within one hundred miles of Udaipur. ‘Opinion’ was the sole\r\nand all-sufficient ally effecting this political reform. The Rajputs, in\r\nfact, did not require the demonstration of our physical strength; its\r\ninfluence had reached far beyond Mewar. When the few firelocks defeated\r\nhundreds of the foes of public tranquillity, they attributed it to ‘the\r\nstrength of the Company’s salt,’[4.18.21] the moral agency of which was\r\nproclaimed the true basis of our power. ‘Sachha Raj’ was the proud\r\nepithet applied by our new allies to the British Government in the East;\r\na title which distinguished the immortal Alfred, ‘the upright.’\r\n\r\nIt will readily be imagined that a reform, which went to touch the\r\nentire feudal association, could not be accomplished without harassing\r\nand painful discussions [488], when the object was the renunciation of\r\nlands, to which in some cases the right of inheritance could be pleaded,\r\nin others, the cognisance of successful revenge, while to many\r\nprescriptive possession could be asserted. It was the more painful,\r\nbecause although the shades which marked the acquisition of such lands\r\nwere varied, no distinction could be made in the mode of settlement,\r\nnamely, unconditional surrender. In some cases, the Rana had to revoke\r\nhis own grants, wrung either from his necessities or his weakness; but\r\nin neither predicament could arguments be adduced to soften\r\nrenunciation, or to meet the powerful and pathetic and often angry\r\nappeals to justice or to prejudice. Counter-appeals to their loyalty,\r\nand the necessity for the re-establishment of their sovereign’s just\r\nweight and influence in the social body, without which their own welfare\r\ncould not be secured, were adduced; but individual views and passions\r\nwere too absorbing to bend to the general interest. Weeks thus passed in\r\ninterchange of visits, in soothing pride, and in flattering vanity by\r\nthe revival of past recollections, which gradually familiarized the\r\nsubject to the mind of the chiefs, and brought them to compliance. Time,\r\nconciliation, and impartial justice, confirmed the victory thus\r\nobtained; and when they were made to see that no interest was\r\noverlooked, that party views were unknown, and that the system included\r\nevery class of society in its beneficial operation, cordiality followed\r\nconcession. Some of these cessions were alienations from the crown of\r\nhalf a century’s duration. Individual cases of hardship were unavoidable\r\nwithout incurring the imputation of favouritism, and the dreaded revival\r\nof ancient feuds, to abolish which was indispensable, but required much\r\ncircumspection. Castles and lands in this predicament could therefore\r\nneither be retained by the possessor nor returned to the ancient\r\nproprietor without rekindling the torch of civil war. The sole\r\nalternative was for the crown to take the object of contention, and make\r\ncompensation from its own domain. It would be alike tedious and\r\nuninteresting to enter into the details of these arrangements, where one\r\nchief had to relinquish the levy of transit duties in the most important\r\noutlet of the country, asserted to have been held during seven\r\ngenerations, as in the case of the chief of Deogarh. Of another (the\r\nBhindar chief) who held forty-three towns and villages, in addition to\r\nhis grant; of Amet, of Badesar, of Dabla, of Lawa, and many others who\r\nheld important fortresses of the crown independent of its will; and\r\nother claims, embracing every right [489] and privilege appertaining to\r\nfeudal society; suffice it, that in six months the whole arrangements\r\nwere effected.\r\n\r\n=The Case of Arja.=—In the painful and protracted discussions attendant\r\non these arrangements, powerful traits of national character were\r\ndeveloped. The castle and domain of Arja half a century ago belonged to\r\nthe crown, but had been usurped by the Purawats, from whom it was\r\nwrested by storm about fifteen years back by the Saktawats, and a patent\r\nsanctioning possession was obtained, on the payment of a fine of £1000\r\nto the Rana. Its surrender was now required from Fateh Singh, the second\r\nbrother of Bhindar, the head of this clan; but being regarded as the\r\nvictorious completion of a feud, it was not easy to silence their\r\nprejudices and objections. The renunciation of the forty-three towns and\r\nvillages by the chief of the clan caused not half the excitation, and\r\nevery Saktawat seemed to forgo his individual losses in the common\r\nsentiment expressed by their head: “Arja is the price of blood, and with\r\nits cession our honour is surrendered.” To preserve the point of honour,\r\nit was stipulated that it should not revert to the Purawats, but be\r\nincorporated with the fisc, which granted an equivalent; when letters of\r\nsurrender were signed by both brothers, whose conduct throughout was\r\nmanly and confiding.\r\n\r\n=Badnor and Amet.=—The Badnor and Amet chiefs, both of the superior\r\ngrade of nobles, were the most formidable obstacles to the operation of\r\nthe treaty of the 4th of May. The first of these, by name Jeth Singh\r\n(_the victorious_ [_chief_] _lion_), was of the Mertia clan, the bravest\r\nof the brave race of Rathor, whose ancestors had left their native\r\nabodes on the plains of Marwar, and accompanied the celebrated Mira Bai\r\non her marriage with Rana Kumbha. His descendants, amongst whom was\r\nJaimall, of immortal memory, enjoyed honour in Mewar equal to their\r\nbirth and high deserts. It was the more difficult to treat with men like\r\nthese, whose conduct had been a contrast to the general license of the\r\ntimes, and who had reason to feel offended, when no distinction was\r\nobserved between them and those who had disgraced the name of Rajput.\r\nInstead of the submission expected from the Rathor, so overwhelmed was\r\nhe from the magnitude of the claims, which amounted to a virtual\r\nextinction of his power, that he begged leave to resign his estates and\r\nquit the country. In prosecution of this design, he took post in the\r\nchief hall of the palace, from which no entreaties could make him\r\nmove;[4.18.22] until the Rana, to [490] escape his importunities, and\r\neven restraint, obtained his promise to abide by the decision of the\r\nAgent. The forms of the Rana’s court, from time immemorial, prohibit all\r\npersonal communication between the sovereign and his chiefs in matters\r\nof individual interest, by which indecorous altercation is avoided. But\r\nthe ministers, whose office it was to obtain every information, did not\r\nmake a rigid scrutiny into the title-deeds of the various estates\r\nprevious to advancing the claims of the crown. This brave man had\r\nenemies, and he was too proud to have recourse to the common arts either\r\nof adulation or bribery to aid his cause. It was a satisfaction to find\r\nthat the two principal towns demanded of him were embodied in a grant of\r\nSangram Singh’s reign; and the absolute rights of the fisc, of which he\r\nhad become possessed, were cut down to about fifteen thousand rupees of\r\nannual revenue. But there were other points on which he was even more\r\ntenacious than the surrender of these. Being the chief noble of the fine\r\ndistrict of Badnor, which consisted of three hundred and sixty towns and\r\nvillages, chiefly of feudal allotments (many of them of his own clan),\r\nhe had taken advantage of the times to establish his influence over\r\nthem, to assume the right of wardship of minors, and secure those\r\nservices which were due to the prince, but which he wanted the power to\r\nenforce. The holders of these estates were of the third class of vassals\r\nor _gol_ (the mass), whose services it was important to reclaim, and who\r\nconstituted in past times the most efficient force of the Ranas, and\r\nwere the preponderating balance of their authority when mercenaries were\r\nunknown in these patriarchal states. Abundant means towards a just\r\ninvestigation had been previously procured; and after some discussion,\r\nin which all admissible claims were recognized, and argument was\r\nsilenced by incontrovertible facts, this chieftain relinquished all that\r\nwas demanded, and sent in, as from himself, his written renunciation to\r\nhis sovereign. However convincing the data by which his proper rights\r\nand those of his prince were defined, it was to feeling and prejudice\r\nthat we were mainly indebted for so satisfactory an adjustment. An\r\nappeal to the name of Jaimall, who fell defending Chitor against\r\nAkbar,[4.18.23] and the contrast of his ancestor’s loyalty and devotion\r\nwith his own contumacy, acted as a talisman, and wrung tears from his\r\neyes and the deed from his hand. It will afford some idea of the\r\ndifficulties encountered, as well as the invidiousness of the task of\r\narbitrating such matters, to give his own comment verbatim: \"I remained\r\nfaithful when his own kin deserted him, and was [491] one of four chiefs\r\nwho alone of all Mewar fought for him in the rebellion; but the son of\r\nJaimall is forgotten, while the ‘plunderer’ is his boon companion, and\r\nthough of inferior rank, receives an estate which elevates him above\r\nme\"; alluding to the chief of Badesar, who plundered the queen’s dower.\r\nBut while the brave descendant of Jaimall returned to Badnor with the\r\nmarks of his sovereign’s favour, and the applause of those he esteemed,\r\nthe ‘runner’ went back to Badesar in disgrace, to which his prince’s\r\ninjudicious favour further contributed.\r\n\r\n=Hamīra of Badesar.=—Hamira of Badesar was of the second class of\r\nnobles, a Chondawat by birth. He succeeded to his father Sardar Singh,\r\nthe assassin of the prime minister even in the palace of his\r\nsovereign;[4.18.24] into whose presence he had the audacity to pursue\r\nthe surviving brother, destined to avenge him.[4.18.25] Hamira inherited\r\nall the turbulence and disaffection, with the estates, of his father;\r\nand this most conspicuous of the many lawless chieftains of the times\r\nwas known throughout Rajasthan as Hamira ‘the runner’ (_daurayat_).\r\nThough not entitled to hold lands beyond thirty thousand annually, he\r\nhad become possessed to the amount of eighty thousand, chiefly of the\r\nfisc or _khalisa_, and nearly all obtained by violence, though since\r\nconfirmed by the prince’s patent. With the chieftain of Lawa (precisely\r\nin the same predicament), who held the fortress of Kheroda and other\r\nvaluable lands, Hamira resided entirely at the palace, and obtaining the\r\nRana’s ear by professions of obedience, kept possession, while chiefs in\r\nevery respect his superiors had been compelled to surrender; and when at\r\nlength the Saktawat of Lawa was forbid the court until Kheroda and all\r\nhis usurpations were yielded up, the son of Sardar displayed his usual\r\nturbulence, ‘curled his moustache’ at the minister, and hinted at the\r\nfate of his predecessor. Although none dared to imitate him, his\r\nstubbornness was not without admirers, especially among his own clan;\r\nand as it was too evident that fear or favour swayed the Rana, it was a\r\ncase for the Agent’s interference, the opportunity for which was soon\r\nafforded. When [492] forced to give letters of surrender, the Rana’s\r\nfunctionaries, who went to take possession, were insulted, refused\r\nadmittance, and compelled to return. Not a moment could be lost in\r\npunishing this contempt of authority; and as the Rana was holding a\r\ncourt when the report arrived, the Agent requested an audience. He found\r\nthe Rana and his chiefs assembled in ‘the balcony of the sun,’ and\r\namongst them the notorious Hamira. After the usual compliments, the\r\nAgent asked the minister if his master had been put in possession of\r\nSyana. It was evident from the general constraint, that all were\r\nacquainted with the result of the deputation; but to remove\r\nresponsibility from the minister, the Agent, addressing the Rana as if\r\nhe were in ignorance of the insult, related the transaction, and\r\nobserved that his government would hold him culpable if he remained at\r\nUdaipur while his highness’s commands were disregarded. Thus supported,\r\nthe Rana resumed his dignity, and in forcible language signified to all\r\npresent his anxious desire to do nothing which was harsh or ungracious;\r\nbut that, thus compelled, he would not recede from what became him as\r\ntheir sovereign. Calling for a _bira_, he looked sternly at Hamira, and\r\ncommanded him to quit his presence instantly, and the capital in an\r\nhour; and, but for the Agent’s interposition, he would have been\r\nbanished the country. Confiscation of his whole estate was commanded,\r\nuntil renunciation was completed. He departed that night; and, contrary\r\nto expectation, not only were all the usurpations surrendered, but, what\r\nwas scarcely contemplated by the Agent, the Rana’s flag of sequestration\r\nwas quietly admitted into the fortress of Badesar.[4.18.26]\r\n\r\n=The Case of Āmli.=—One more anecdote may suffice. The lands and\r\nfortress of Amli had been in the family of Amet since the year 27, only\r\nfive years posterior to the date to which these arrangements extended;\r\ntheir possession verged on half a century. The lords of Amet were of the\r\nSixteen, and were chiefs of the clan Jagawat. The present representative\r\nenjoyed a fair character: he could, with the chief of Badnor, claim the\r\nsuccession of the loyal; for Partap and Jaimall, their respective\r\nancestors, were rivals and martyrs on that memorable day when the genius\r\nof Chitor abandoned the Sesodias. But the heir of Amet had not this\r\nalone [493] to support his claims; for his predecessor Partap had lost\r\nhis life in defending his country against the Mahrattas, and Amli had\r\nbeen his acquisition. Fateh Singh (such was his name) was put forward by\r\nthe more artful of his immediate kin, the Chondawat interest; but his\r\ndisposition, blunt and impetuous, was little calculated to promote their\r\nviews: he was an honest Rajput, who neither could nor cared to conceal\r\nhis anger, and at a ceremonious visit paid him by the Agent, he had\r\nhardly sufficient control over himself to be courteous, and though he\r\nsaid nothing, his eyes, inflamed with opium and disdain, spoke his\r\nfeelings. He maintained a dogged indifference, and was inaccessible to\r\nargument, till at length, following the example of Badnor, he was\r\ninduced to abide by the Agent’s mediation. He came attended by his\r\nvassals, who anxiously awaited the result, which an unpremeditated\r\nincident facilitated. After a long and fruitless expostulation, he had\r\ntaken refuge in an obstinate silence; and seated in a chair opposite to\r\nthe envoy, with his shield in front, placed perpendicularly on his\r\nknees, and his arms and head reclined thereon, he continued vacantly\r\nlooking on the ground. To interrupt this uncourteous silence in his own\r\nhouse, the envoy took a picture, which with several others was at hand,\r\nand placing it before him, remarked, \"That chief did not gain his\r\nreputation for _swamidharma_[4.18.27] (loyalty) by conduct such as\r\nyours.\" His eyes suddenly recovered their animation and his countenance\r\nwas lighted with a smile, as he rapidly uttered, “How did you come by\r\nthis—why does this interest you?” A tear started in his eye as he added,\r\n\"This is my father!\"—“Yes,” said the Agent, \"it is the loyal Partap on\r\nthe day he went forth to meet his death; but his name yet lives, and a\r\nstranger does homage to his fame.\"—“Take Amli, take Amli,” he hurriedly\r\nrepeated, with a suppressed tone of exultation and sorrow, “but forget\r\nnot the extent of the sacrifice.” To prolong the visit would have been\r\npainful to both, but as it might have been trusting too much to humanity\r\nto delay the resumption, the Agent availed himself of the moment to\r\nindite the _chhorchitthi_[4.18.28] of surrender for the lands.\r\n\r\nWith these instances, characteristic of individuals and the times, this\r\nsketch of the introductory measures for improving the condition of Mewar\r\nmay be closed. To enter more largely in detail is foreign to the purpose\r\nof the work; nor is it requisite for the comprehension of the unity of\r\nthe object, that a more minute dissection of the parts should be\r\nafforded. Before, however, we exhibit the [494] general results of these\r\narrangements, we shall revert to the condition of the more humble, but a\r\nmost important part of the community, the peasantry of Mewar; and\r\nembody, in a few remarks, the fruits of observation or inquiry, as to\r\ntheir past and present state, their rights, the establishment of them,\r\ntheir infringement, and restitution. On this subject much has been\r\nnecessarily introduced in the sketch of the feudal system, where landed\r\ntenures were discussed; but it is one on which such a contrariety of\r\nopinion exists, that it may be desirable to show the exact state of\r\nlanded tenures in a country, where Hindu manners should exist in greater\r\npurity than in any other part of the vast continent of India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FACSIMILE OF NATIVE DRAWING OF PARTĀB SINGH AND RĀĒMALL.\r\n  _To face page 572._\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The Landed System.=—The ryot (cultivator) is the proprietor of the soil\r\nin Mewar. He compares his right therein to the _akshay duba_,[4.18.29]\r\nwhich no vicissitudes can destroy. He calls the land his _bapota_, the\r\nmost emphatic, the most ancient, the most cherished, and the most\r\nsignificant phrase his language commands for patrimonial[4.18.30]\r\ninheritance. He has nature and Manu in support of his claim, and can\r\nquote the text, alike compulsory on prince and peasant, “cultivated land\r\nis the property of him who cut away the wood, or who cleared and tilled\r\nit,”[4.18.31] an ordinance binding on the whole Hindu race, and which no\r\ninternational wars, or conquest, could overturn. In accordance with this\r\nprinciple is the ancient adage, not of Mewar only but all Rajputana,\r\n_Bhog ra dhanni Raj ho: bhum ra dhanni ma cho_: ‘the government is owner\r\nof the rent, but I am the master of the land.’ With the toleration and\r\nbenevolence of the race the conqueror is commanded “to respect the\r\ndeities adored by the conquered, also their virtuous priests, and to\r\nestablish the laws of the conquered nation as declared in their\r\nbooks.”[4.18.32] If it were deemed desirable to recede to the system of\r\npure Hindu agrarian law, there is no deficiency of materials. The\r\ncustomary laws contained in the various reports of able men, superadded\r\nto the general ordinances of Manu, would form a code at once simple and\r\nefficient: for though innovation from foreign conquest has placed many\r\nprinciples in abeyance, and modified others, yet he has observed to\r\nlittle purpose [495] who does not trace a uniformity of design, which at\r\none time had ramified wherever the name of Hindu prevailed: language has\r\nbeen modified, and terms have been corrupted or changed, but the primary\r\npervading principle is yet perceptible; and whether we examine the\r\nsystems of Khandesh, the Carnatic, or Rajasthan, we shall discover the\r\nelements to be the same.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the system from the period described by Arrian, Curtius,\r\nand Diodorus, we shall see in the government of townships each commune\r\nan ‘_imperium in imperio_’; a little republic, maintaining its municipal\r\nlegislation independent of the monarchy, on which it relies for general\r\nsupport, and to which it pays the _bhog_, or tax in kind, as the price\r\nof this protection; for though the prescribed duties of kings are as\r\nwell defined by Manu[4.18.33] as by any jurisconsult in Europe, nothing\r\ncan be more lax than the mutual relations of the governed and governing\r\nin Hindu monarchies, which are resolved into unbounded liberty of\r\naction. To the artificial regulation of society, which leaves all who\r\ndepend on manual exertion to an immutable degradation, must be ascribed\r\nthese multitudinous governments, unknown to the rest of mankind, which,\r\nin spite of such dislocation, maintain the bonds of mutual sympathies.\r\nStrictly speaking, every State presents the picture of so many hundred\r\nor thousand minute republics, without any connexion with each other,\r\ngiving allegiance (_an_) and rent (_bhog_) to a prince, who neither\r\nlegislates for them, nor even forms a police for their internal\r\nprotection. It is consequent on this want of paramount interference\r\nthat, in matters of police, of justice, and of law, the communes act for\r\nthemselves; and from this want of paternal interference only have arisen\r\nthose courts of equity, or arbitration, the _panchayats_.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the freehold ryot of Mewar, whose _bapota_ is the\r\n_watan_ and the _miras_ of the peninsula—words of foreign growth,\r\nintroduced by the Muhammadan conquerors; the first (Persian) is of more\r\ngeneral use in Khandesh; the other (Arabic) in the Carnatic. Thus the\r\ngreat Persian moralist Saadi exemplifies its application: \"If you desire\r\nto succeed to your father’s inheritance (_miras_), first obtain his\r\nwisdom\" [496].\r\n\r\nWhile the term _bapota_ thus implies the inheritance or patrimony, its\r\nholder, if a military vassal, is called Bhumia, a term equally powerful,\r\nmeaning one actually identified with the soil (_bhum_), and for which\r\nthe Muhammadan has no equivalent but in the possessive compound\r\n_watandar_, or _mirasdar_. The Caniatchi[4.18.34] of Malabar is the\r\nBhumia of Rajasthan.\r\n\r\nThe emperors of Delhi, in the zenith of their power, bestowed the\r\nepithet zamindar upon the Hindu tributary sovereigns: not out of\r\ndisrespect, but in the true application of their own term Bhumia Raj,\r\nexpressive of their tenacity to the soil; and this fact affords\r\nadditional evidence of the proprietary right being in the cultivator\r\n(_ryot_), namely, that he alone can confer the freehold land, which\r\ngives the title of Bhumia, and of which both past history and present\r\nusage will furnish us with examples. When the tenure of land obtained\r\nfrom the cultivator is held more valid than the grant of the sovereign,\r\nit will be deemed a conclusive argument of the proprietary right being\r\nvested in the ryot. What should induce a chieftain, when inducted into a\r\nperpetual fief, to establish through the ryot a right to a few acres in\r\nbhum, but the knowledge that although the vicissitudes of fortune or of\r\nfavour may deprive him of his aggregate signiorial rights, his claims,\r\nderived from the spontaneous favour of the commune, can never be set\r\naside; and when he ceases to be the lord, he becomes a member of the\r\ncommonwealth, merging his title of Thakur, or Signior, into the more\r\nhumble one of Bhumia, the allodial tenant of the Rajput feudal system,\r\nelsewhere discussed.[4.18.35] Thus we have touched on the method by\r\nwhich he acquires this distinction, for protecting the community from\r\nviolence; and if left destitute by the negligence or inability of the\r\ngovernment, he is vested with the rights of the crown, in its share of\r\nthe _bhog_ or rent. But when their own land is in the predicament called\r\n_galita_, or reversions from lapses to the commune, he is ‘seised’ in\r\nall the rights of the former proprietor; or, by internal arrangements,\r\nthey can convey such right by cession of the commune.\r\n\r\n=The Bhūmia.=—The privilege attached to the _bhum_,[4.18.36] and\r\nacquired from the community by the protection afforded to it, is the\r\nmost powerful argument for the recognition of its original rights. The\r\nBhumia, thus vested, may at pleasure drive his own plough [497], the\r\nright to the soil. His _bhum_ is exempt from the _jarib_ (measuring\r\nrod); it is never assessed, and his only sign of allegiance is a\r\nquit-rent, in most cases triennial, and the tax of _kharlakar_,[4.18.37]\r\na war imposition, now commuted for money. The State, however, indirectly\r\nreceives the services of these allodial tenants, the yeomen of\r\nRajasthan, who constitute, as in the districts of Kumbhalmer and\r\nMandalgarh, the landwehr, or local militia. In fact, since the days of\r\nuniversal repose set in, and the townships required no protection, an\r\narrangement was made with the Bhumias of Mewar, in which the crown,\r\nforegoing its claim of quit-rent, has obtained their services in the\r\ngarrisons and frontier stations of police at a very slight pecuniary\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\nSuch are the rights and privileges derived from the ryot cultivator\r\nalone. The Rana may dispossess the chiefs of Badnor, or Salumbar, of\r\ntheir estates, the grant of the crown—he could not touch the rights\r\nemanating from the community; and thus the descendants of a chieftain,\r\nwho a few years before might have followed his sovereign at the head of\r\none hundred cavaliers, would descend into the humble foot militia of a\r\ndistrict. Thousands are in this predicament: the Kanawats, Lunawats,\r\nKumbhawats, and other clans, who, like the Celt, forget not their claims\r\nof birth in the distinctions of fortune, but assert their propinquity as\r\n“brothers in the nineteenth or thirtieth degree to the prince” on the\r\nthrone. So sacred was the tenure derived from the ryot, that even\r\nmonarchs held lands in _bhum_ from their subjects, for an instance of\r\nwhich we are indebted to the great poetic historian of the last Hindu\r\nking. Chand relates, that when his sovereign, the Chauhan, had\r\nsubjugated the kingdom of Anhilwara[4.18.38] from the Solanki, he\r\nreturned to the nephew of the conquered prince several districts and\r\nseaports, and all the bhum held by the family. In short, the Rajput\r\nvaunts his aristocratic distinction derived from the land; and opposes\r\nthe title of ‘Bhumia Raj,’ or government of the soil, to the ‘Bania\r\nRaj,’ or commercial government, which he affixes as an epithet of\r\ncontempt to Jaipur: where “wealth accumulates and men decay.”\r\n\r\nIn the great ‘register of patents’ (_patta bahi_) of Mewar we find a\r\nspecies of [498] _bhum_ held by the greater vassals on particular crown\r\nlands; whether this originated from inability of ceding entire townships\r\nto complete the estate to the rank of the incumbent, or whether it was\r\nmerely in confirmation of the grant of the commune, could not be\r\nascertained. The benefit from this _bhum_ is only pecuniary, and the\r\ntitle is ‘_bhum rakhwali_’[4.18.39] or land [in return for]\r\n‘preservation.’ Strange to say, the crown itself holds ‘_bhum rakhwali_’\r\non its own fiscal demesnes consisting of small portions in each village,\r\nto the amount of ten thousand rupees in a district of thirty or forty\r\ntownships. This species, however, is so incongruous that we can only\r\nstate it does exist: we should vainly seek the cause for such apparent\r\nabsurdity, for since society has been unhinged, the oracles are mute to\r\nmuch of antiquated custom.\r\n\r\n=Occupiers’ Rights in the Land.=—We shall close these remarks with some\r\nillustrative traditions and yet existing customs, to substantiate the\r\nryot’s right in the soil of Mewar. After one of those convulsions\r\ndescribed in the annals, the prince had gone to espouse the daughter of\r\nthe Raja of Mandor, the (then) capital of Marwar. It is customary at the\r\nmoment of _hathleva_, or the junction of hands, that any request\r\npreferred by the bridegroom to the father of the bride should meet\r\ncompliance, a usage which has yielded many fatal results; and the Rana\r\nhad been prompted on this occasion to demand a body of ten thousand Jat\r\ncultivators to repeople the deserted fisc of Mewar. An assent was given\r\nto the unprecedented demand, but when the inhabitants were thus\r\ndespotically called on to migrate, they denied the power and refused.\r\n“Shall we,” said they, \"abandon the lands of our inheritance (_bapota_),\r\nthe property of our children, to accompany a stranger into a foreign\r\nland, there to labour for him? Kill us you may, but never shall we\r\nrelinquish our inalienable rights.\" The Mandor prince, who had trusted\r\nto this reply, deemed himself exonerated from his promise, and secured\r\nfrom the loss of so many subjects: but he was deceived. The Rana held\r\nout to them the enjoyment of the proprietary rights escheated to the\r\ncrown in his country, with the lands left without occupants by the\r\nsword, and to all, increase of property. When equal and absolute power\r\nwas thus conferred, they no longer hesitated to exchange the arid soil\r\nof Marwar for the garden of Rajwara; and the descendants of these Jats\r\nstill occupy the flats watered by the Berach and Banas [499].\r\n\r\nIn those districts which afforded protection from innovation, the\r\nproprietary right of the ryot will be found in full force; of this the\r\npopulous and extensive district of Jahazpur, consisting of one hundred\r\nand six townships, affords a good specimen. There are but two pieces of\r\nland throughout the whole of this tract the property of the crown, and\r\nthese were obtained by force during the occupancy of Zalim Singh of\r\nKotah. The right thus unjustly acquired was, from the conscientiousness\r\nof the Rana’s civil governor, on the point of being annulled by sale and\r\nreversion, when the court interfered to maintain its proprietary right\r\nto the tanks of Loharia and Itaunda, and the lands which they irrigate,\r\nnow the _bhum_ of the Rana.[4.18.40] This will serve as an illustration\r\nhow _bhum_ may be acquired, and the annals of Kotah will exhibit,\r\nunhappily for the ryots of that country, the almost total annihilation\r\nof their rights, by the same summary process which originally attached\r\nLoharia to the fisc.\r\n\r\nThe power of alienation being thus proved, it would be superfluous to\r\ninsist further on the proprietary right of the cultivator of the soil.\r\n\r\n=Proprietary Rights in Land.=—Besides the ability to alienate as\r\ndemonstrated, all the overt symbols which mark the proprietary right in\r\nother countries are to be found in Mewar; that of entire conveyance by\r\nsale, or temporary by mortgage; and numerous instances could be adduced,\r\nespecially of the latter. The fertile lands of Horla, along the banks of\r\nthe Khari, are almost all mortgaged, and the registers of these\r\ntransactions form two considerable volumes, in which great variety of\r\ndeeds may be discovered: one extended for one hundred and one\r\nyears;[4.18.41] when redemption was to follow, without regard to\r\ninterest on the one hand; or the benefits from the land on the other,\r\nbut merely by repayment of the sum borrowed. To maintain the interest\r\nduring abeyance, it is generally stipulated that a certain portion of\r\nthe harvest shall be reserved for the mortgagee—a fourth, a fifth, or\r\n_gugri_—a share so small as to be valued only as a mark of proprietary\r\nrecognition.[4.18.42] The mortgagees were chiefly of the commercial\r\nclasses of the large frontier towns; in [500] many cases the proprietor\r\ncontinues to cultivate for another the lands his ancestor mortgaged four\r\nor five generations ago, nor does he deem his right at all impaired. A\r\nplan had been sketched to raise money to redeem these mortgages, from\r\nwhose complex operation the revenue was sure to suffer. No length of\r\ntime or absence can affect the claim to the _bapota_, and so sacred is\r\nthe right of absentees, that land will lay sterile and unproductive from\r\nthe penalty which Manu denounces on all who interfere with their\r\nneighbour’s rights: “for unless there be an especial agreement between\r\nthe owner of the land and the seed, the fruits belong clearly to the\r\nland-owner”; even “if seed conveyed by water or by wind should\r\ngerminate, the plant belongs to the land-owner, the mere sower takes not\r\nthe fruit.”[4.18.43] Even crime and the extreme sentence of the law will\r\nnot alter succession to property, either to the military or cultivating\r\nvassal; and the old Kentish adage, probably introduced by the Jats from\r\nScandinavia, who under Hengist established that kingdom of the\r\nheptarchy, namely:\r\n\r\n                       The father to the bough,\r\n                       And the son to the plough\r\n\r\nis practically understood by the Jats and Bhumias[4.18.44] of Mewar,\r\nwhose treason is not deemed hereditary, nor a chain of noble acts\r\ndestroyed because a false link was thrown out. We speak of the military\r\nvassals—the cultivator cannot aspire to so dignified a crime as treason.\r\n\r\n=Village Officials: the Patel.=—The officers of the townships are the\r\nsame as have been so often described, and are already too familiar to\r\nthose interested in the subject to require illustration. From the Patel,\r\nthe Cromwell of each township, to the village gossip, the ascetic\r\nSannyasi, each deems his office, and the land he holds in virtue thereof\r\nin perpetuity, free of rent to the State, except a small triennial\r\nquit-rent,[4.18.45] and the liability, like every other branch of the\r\nState, to two war taxes.[4.18.46]\r\n\r\nOpinions are various as to the origin and attributes of the Patel, the\r\nmost important personage in village sway, whose office is by many deemed\r\nforeign to the pure Hindu system, and to which language even his title\r\nis deemed alien. But there is no doubt that both office and title are of\r\nancient growth, and even etymological rule proves the Patel to be head\r\n(_pati_) of the community.[4.18.47] The office of Patel [501] of Mewar\r\nwas originally elective: he was ‘_primus inter pares_,’ the constituted\r\nattorney or representative of the commune, and as the medium between the\r\ncultivator and the government, enjoyed benefits from both. Besides his\r\n_bapota_, and the _serano_, or one-fortieth of all produce from the\r\nryot, he had a remission of a third or fourth of the rent from such\r\nextra lands as he might cultivate in addition to his patrimony. Such was\r\nthe Patel, the link connecting the peasant with the government, ere\r\npredatory war subverted all order: but as rapine increased, so did his\r\nauthority. He became the plenipotentiary of the community, the security\r\nfor the contribution imposed, and often the hostage for its payment,\r\nremaining in the camp of the predatory hordes till they were paid off.\r\nHe gladly undertook the liquidation of such contributions as these\r\nperpetual invaders imposed. To indemnify himself, a schedule was formed\r\nof the share of each ryot, and mortgage of land, and sequestration of\r\npersonal effects followed till his avarice was satisfied. Who dared\r\ncomplain against a Patel, the intimate of Pathan and Mahratta\r\ncommanders, his adopted patrons? He thus became the master of his\r\nfellow-citizens; and, as power corrupts all men, their tyrant instead of\r\ntheir mediator. It was a system necessarily involving its own decay; for\r\na while glutted with plenty, but failing with the supply, and ending in\r\ndesolation, exile, and death. Nothing was left to prey on but the\r\ndespoiled carcase; yet when peace returned, and in its train the exile\r\nryot to reclaim the _bapota_, the vampire Patel was resuscitated, and\r\nevinced the same ardour for supremacy, and the same cupidity which had\r\nso materially aided to convert the fertile Mewar to a desert. The Patel\r\naccordingly proved one of the chief obstacles to returning prosperity;\r\nand the attempt to reduce this corrupted middle-man to his original\r\nstation in society was both difficult and hazardous, from the support\r\nthey met in the corrupt officers at court, and other influences ‘behind\r\nthe curtain.’ A system of renting the crown lands deemed the most\r\nexpedient to advance prosperity, it was incumbent to find a remedy for\r\nthis evil. The mere name of some of these petty tyrants inspired such\r\nterror as to check all desire of return to the country; but the origin\r\nof the institution of the office and its abuses being ascertained, it\r\nwas imperative, though difficult, to restore the one and banish the\r\nother. The original elective right in many townships was therefore\r\nreturned to the ryot, who nominated new Patels [502], his choice being\r\nconfirmed by the Rana, in whose presence investiture was performed by\r\nbinding a turban on the elected, for which he presented his _nazar_.\r\nTraces of the sale of these offices in past times were observable; and\r\nit was deemed of primary importance to avoid all such channels for\r\ncorruption, in order that the ryot’s election should meet with no\r\nobstacle. That the plan was beneficial there could be no doubt; that the\r\nbenefit would be permanent, depended, unfortunately, on circumstances\r\nwhich those most anxious had not the means to control: for it must be\r\nrecollected, that although “personal aid and advice might be given when\r\nasked,” all internal interference was by treaty strictly, and most\r\njustly, prohibited.\r\n\r\nAfter a few remarks on the mode of levying the crown-rents, we shall\r\nconclude the subject of village economy in Mewar, and proceed to close\r\nthis too extended chapter with the results of four years of peace and\r\nthe consequent improved prosperity.\r\n\r\n=Modes of Collecting Rents.=—There are two methods of levying the\r\nrevenues of the crown on every description of corn—_kankut_ and _batai_,\r\nfor on sugar-cane, poppy, oil, hemp, tobacco, cotton, indigo, and garden\r\nstuffs, a money payment is fixed, varying from two to six rupees per\r\nbigha. The _kankut_[4.18.48] is a conjectural assessment of the standing\r\ncrop, by the united judgement of the officers of government, the Patel,\r\nthe Patwari, or registrar, and the owner of the field. The accuracy with\r\nwhich an accustomed eye will determine the quantity of grain on a given\r\nsurface is surprising: but should the owner deem the estimate overrated,\r\nhe can insist on _batai_, or division of the corn after it is threshed;\r\nthe most ancient and only infallible mode by which the dues either of\r\nthe government or the husbandman can be ascertained. In the _batai_\r\nsystem the share of the government varies from one-third to two-fifths\r\nof the spring harvest, as wheat and barley; and sometimes even half,\r\nwhich is the invariable proportion of the autumnal crops. In either\r\ncase, _kankut_ or _batai_, when the shares are appropriated, those of\r\nthe crown may be commuted to a money payment at the average rate of the\r\nmarket. The _kut_ is the most liable to corruption. The ryot bribes the\r\ncollector, who will underrate the crop; and when he betrays his duty,\r\nthe _shahnah_, or watchman, is not likely to be honest: and as the\r\n_makai_, or Indian corn, the grand autumnal crop of Mewar, is eaten\r\ngreen, the crown may be defrauded of half its dues. The system is one of\r\nuncertainty, from which eventually the ryot derives no advantage, though\r\nit [503] fosters the cupidity of patels and collectors; but there was a\r\n_barar_, or tax, introduced to make up for this deficiency, which was in\r\nproportion to the quantity cultivated, and its amount at the mercy of\r\nthe officers. Thus the ryot went to work with a mill-stone round his\r\nneck; instead of the exhilarating reflection that every hour’s\r\nadditional labour was his own, he saw merely the advantage of these\r\nharpies, and contented himself with raising a scanty subsistence in a\r\nslovenly and indolent manner, by which he forfeited the ancient\r\nreputation of the Jat cultivator of Mewar.\r\n\r\n=Improvement in the Condition of the People.=—Notwithstanding these and\r\nvarious other drawbacks to the prosperity of the country, in an\r\nimpoverished court, avaricious and corrupt officers, discontented\r\nPatels, and bad seasons, yet the final report in May 1822 could not but\r\nbe gratifying when contrasted with that of February 1818. In order to\r\nascertain the progressive improvement, a census had been made at the end\r\nof 1821, of the three central fiscal districts[4.18.49] watered by the\r\nBerach and Banas. As a specimen of the whole, we may take the _tappa_ or\r\nsubdivision of Sahara. Of its twenty-seven villages, six were inhabited\r\nin 1818, the number of families being three hundred and sixty-nine,\r\nthree-fourths of whom belonged to the resumed town of Amli. In 1821 nine\r\nhundred and twenty-six families were reported, and every village of the\r\ntwenty-seven was occupied, so that population had almost trebled. The\r\nnumber of ploughs was more than trebled, and cultivation quadrupled; and\r\nthough this, from the causes described, was not above one-third of what\r\nreal industry might have effected, the contrast was abundantly cheering.\r\nThe same ratio of prosperity applied to the entire crown demesne of\r\nMewar. By the recovery of Kumbhalmer, Raepur, Rajnagar, and Sadri-Kanera\r\nfrom the Mahrattas; of Jahazpur from Kotah; of the usurpations of the\r\nnobles; together with the resumption of all the estates of the females\r\nof his family, a task at once difficult and delicate;[4.18.50] and by\r\nthe subjugation of the mountain districts of Merwara, a thousand towns\r\nand villages were united to form the fiscal demesne of the Rana,\r\ncomposing twenty-four districts of various magnitudes, divided, as in\r\nancient times, and with the primitive [504] appellations, into portions\r\ntantamount to the tithings and hundreds of England, the division from\r\ntime immemorial amongst the Hindus.[4.18.51] From these and the\r\ncommercial duties[4.18.52] a revenue was derived sufficient for the\r\ncomforts, and even the dignities of the prince and his court, and\r\npromising an annual increase in the ratio of good government: but\r\nprofusion scattered all that industry and ingenuity could collect; the\r\nartificial wants of the prince perpetuated the real necessities of the\r\npeasant, and this, it is to be feared, will continue till the present\r\ngeneration shall sleep with their forefathers.\r\n\r\n         _Abstract of the Fiscal Revenues of Mewar in the years\r\n                           1818-19-20-21-22._\r\n\r\n\r\n  Spring harvest of   1818 Rs. 40,000\r\n\r\n          ”           1819    451,281\r\n\r\n          ”           1820    659,100\r\n\r\n          ”           1821  1,018,478\r\n\r\n                                      ┌                         The active\r\n                                                                superintendence\r\n\r\n          ”           1822    936,640 ┤                         of the British Agent\r\n                                                                being\r\n\r\n                                      └                         almost entirely\r\n                                                                withdrawn.\r\n\r\n         _Abstract of Commercial Duties included in the above._\r\n\r\n         In 1818    _Nominal_\r\n            1819   Rs. 96,683\r\n            1820      165,108\r\n            1821      220,000\r\n                               ┌  Farmed for three years,\r\n                               │  from 1822, for 750,000 rupees,\r\n            1822      217,000  ┤  which was assigned by the\r\n                               │  Rana for the liquidation of\r\n                               └  tribute fallen in arrear.\r\n\r\n=Mines and Minerals.=—There are sources of wealth in Mewar yet\r\nuntouched, and to which her princes owe much of their power. The tin\r\nmines of Jawara and Dariba alone, little more than half a century ago,\r\nyielded above three lakhs annually;[4.18.53] besides rich copper mines\r\nin various parts. From such, beyond a doubt, much of the wealth of Mewar\r\nwas extracted, but the miners are now dead, and the mines filled with\r\nwater. An attempt was made to work them, but it was so unprofitable that\r\nthe design was soon abandoned.\r\n\r\nNothing will better exemplify the progress of prosperity than the\r\ncomparative population of some of the chief towns before, and after,\r\nfour years of peace:\r\n\r\n                       No. of houses in   No. of houses in 1822.\r\n                            1818.\r\n\r\n        Udaipur               3,500                 10,000\r\n\r\n        Bhilwara               _not                  2,700\r\n                               one_\r\n\r\n        Pur                     200                  1,200\r\n\r\n        Mandal                   80                    400\r\n\r\n        Gosunda                  60              350 [505]\r\n\r\n=The Feudal Lands.=—The feudal lands, which were then double the fiscal,\r\ndid not exhibit the like improvement, the merchant and cultivator\r\nresiding thereon not having the same certainty of reaping the fruits of\r\ntheir industry; still great amelioration took place, and few were so\r\nblind as not to see their account in it.[4.18.54] The earnestness with\r\nwhich many requested the Agent to back their expressed intentions with\r\nhis guarantee to their communities of the same measure of justice and\r\nprotection as the fiscal tenants enjoyed was proof that they well\r\nunderstood the benefits of reciprocal confidence; but this could not be\r\ntendered without danger. Before the Agent left the country he greatly\r\nwithdrew from active interference, it being his constant, as it was his\r\nlast impressive lesson, that they should rely upon themselves if they\r\ndesired to retain a shadow of independence. To give an idea of the\r\nimproved police, insurance which has been described as amounting to\r\neight per cent in a space of twenty-five miles became almost nominal, or\r\none-fourth of a rupee per cent from one frontier to the other. It would,\r\nhowever, have been quite Utopian to have expected that the lawless\r\ntribes would remain in that stupid subordination which the unexampled\r\nstate of society imposed for a time (as described in the opening of\r\nthese transactions), when they found that real restraints did not follow\r\nimaginary terrors. Had the wild tribes been under the sole influence of\r\nBritish power, nothing would have been so simple as effectually, not\r\nonly to control, but to conciliate and improve them; for it is a\r\nmortifying truth, that the more remote from civilization, the more\r\ntractable and easy was the object to manage, more especially the\r\nBhil.[4.18.55] But these children of nature were incorporated in the\r\ndemesnes of the feudal chiefs, who when they found our system did not\r\nextend to perpetual control, returned to their old habits of oppression:\r\nthis provoked retaliation, which to subdue requires more power than the\r\nRana yet possesses, and, in the anomalous state of our alliances, will\r\nalways be an embarrassing task to whosoever may exercise political\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is to be hoped that the years of oppression that have\r\nswept the land will be held in remembrance by the protecting power, and\r\nthat neither petulance nor indolence will lessen the benevolence which\r\nrestored life to Mewar, or mar the picture of comparative happiness it\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\n _The Sixteen chief Nobles of Mewar, their Titles, Names, Clans, Tribes,\r\n                                 Estates,\r\n              number of Villages in each, and their Value._\r\n\r\n ────────┬─────────┬───────────┬───────┬──────────┬─────────┬──────────┬────────────────────\r\n         │         │           │       │          │ Number  │    Value,│\r\n Title.  │ Names.  │Clan.      │Tribe. │Estate.   │   of    │      A.D.│REMARKS.\r\n         │         │           │       │          │Villages.│     1760.│\r\n ────────┼─────────┼───────────┼───────┼──────────┼─────────┼──────────┼────────────────────\r\n Raj     │ Chandan │Jhala      │Jhala  │Sadri     │   127   │   100,000│┌These estates\r\n         │  Singh  │           │       │          │         │          ││are all diminished\r\n Rao     │ Partap  │Chauhan    │Chauhan│Bedla     │   80    │   100,000│┤one-half in nominal\r\n         │  Singh  │           │       │          │         │          ││amount;

Donkin, K.C.B.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.3:\r\n\r\n  The author had the honour to be selected by the Marquess of Hastings\r\n  to represent him at the Rana’s court, with the title of ‘Political\r\n  Agent to the Western Rajput States.’ During the campaign of 1817-18 he\r\n  was placed as the point of communication to the various divisions of\r\n  the northern army; at the same time being intrusted with the\r\n  negotiations with Holkar (previous to the rupture), and with those of\r\n  Kotah and Bundi. He concluded the treaty with the latter State _en\r\n  route_ to Udaipur, where, as at the latter, there were only the\r\n  benefits of moral and political existence to confer.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.4:\r\n\r\n  The author had passed through Bhilwara in May 1806, when it was\r\n  comparatively flourishing. On this occasion (Feb. 1818) it was\r\n  entirely deserted. It excited a smile, in the midst of regrets, to\r\n  observe the practical wit of some of the soldiers, who had supplied\r\n  the naked representative of Adinath with an apron—not of leaves, but\r\n  scarlet cloth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.5:\r\n\r\n  The Agent had seen him when a boy, at a meeting already described; but\r\n  he could scarcely have hoped to find in one, to the formation of whose\r\n  character the times had been so unfavourable, such a specimen as this\r\n  descendant of Partap.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.6:\r\n\r\n  A description of the city and valley will be more appropriate\r\n  elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.7:\r\n\r\n  See p. 508.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.8:\r\n\r\n  The escort consisted of two companies of foot, each of one hundred\r\n  men, with half a troop of cavalry.

Who has lived out of\r\n  the circle of mere vegetation, and not experienced this temporary\r\n  deprivation of moral vitality? for no other simile would suit the\r\n  painful pause in the sympathies of the inhabitants of this once\r\n  fertile region, where experience could point out but one page in their\r\n  annals, one period in their history, when the clangour of the war\r\n  trumpet was suspended, or the sword shut up in its scabbard. The\r\n  portals of Janus at Rome were closed but twice in a period of seven\r\n  hundred years; and in exactly the same time from the conquest by\r\n  Shihabu-d-din to the great pacification, but twice can we record peace\r\n  in Mewar—the reign of Numa has its type in Shah Jahan, while the more\r\n  appropriate reign of Augustus belongs to Britain. Are we to wonder\r\n  then that a chilling void now occupied (if the solecism is admissible)\r\n  the place of interminable action? when the mind was released from the\r\n  anxiety of daily, hourly, devising schemes of preservation, to one of\r\n  perfect security—that enervating calm, in which, to use their own\r\n  homely phrase, _Bher aur bakri ekhi thali se piye_, ‘The wolf and the\r\n  goat drank from the same vessel.’ [Another, and more usual form is—_Āj\r\n  kal, sher bakrī ek ghāt pāni pitē hain_, ‘Nowadays the tiger and the\r\n  goat drink from the same stream.’] But this unruffled torpidity had\r\n  its limit: the Agrarian laws of Mewar were but mentioned, and the\r\n  national pulse instantly rose.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.12:\r\n\r\n  Or rather, who makes the monogrammatic signet _Sahi_ (‘correct’) to\r\n  all deeds, grants, etc.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.13:\r\n\r\n  [Properly Sūratnavīs, ‘statement-writer.’]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.14:\r\n\r\n  The Salumbar chief had his deputy, who resided at court for this sole\r\n  duty, for which he held a village.

The record of the sentiments of the inhabitants towards\r\n  me, as conveyed by the bishop, was gratifying, though their expression\r\n  could excite no surprise in any one acquainted with the characters and\r\n  sensibilities of these people. [The author’s anticipation of the\r\n  prosperity of this town have not been completely realized; but it is\r\n  still an important centre of trade, noted for the manufacture of\r\n  cooking utensils, and possessing a ginning factory and a cotton-press\r\n  (Erskine ii. A. 97 f.).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.20:\r\n\r\n  A literal translation of this curious piece of Hindu legislation will\r\n  be found at the end of the Appendix. If not drawn up with all the\r\n  dignity of the legal enactments of the great governments of the West,\r\n  it has an important advantage in conciseness; the articles cannot be\r\n  misinterpreted, and require no lawyer to expound them.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.21:\r\n\r\n  \"_Kampani Sahib ke namak ke zor se_“ is a common phrase of our native\r\n  soldiery; and ”_Dohai! Kampani ki!_\" is an invocation or appeal\r\n  against injustice; but I never heard this watchword so powerfully\r\n  applied as when a _Sub._ with the Resident’s escort in 1812. One of\r\n  our men, a noble young Rajput about nineteen years of age, and six\r\n  feet high, had been sent with an elephant to forage in the wilds of\r\n  Narwar. A band of at least fifty predatory horsemen assailed him, and\r\n  demanded the surrender of the elephant, which he met by pointing his\r\n  musket and giving them defiance. Beset on all sides, he fired, was cut\r\n  down, and left for dead, in which state he was found, and brought to\r\n  camp upon a litter. One sabre-cut had opened the back entirely across,\r\n  exposing the action of the viscera, and his arms and wrists were\r\n  barbarously hacked: yet he was firm, collected, and even cheerful; and\r\n  to a kind reproach for his rashness, he said, \"What would you have\r\n  said, Captain Sahib, had I surrendered the Company’s musket (_Kampani\r\n  ki banduq_) without fighting?\" From their temperate habits, the wound\r\n  in the back did well; but the severed nerves of the wrists brought on\r\n  a lockjaw of which he died. The Company have thousands who would alike\r\n  die for their _banduq_. It were wise to cherish such feelings.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.22:\r\n\r\n  [An instance of the practice of ‘sitting _dharna_’ to enforce a claim\r\n  (Yule-Burnell, _Hobson-Jobson_, 2nd ed. 315 f.).]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.23:\r\n\r\n  See p. 380.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.24:\r\n\r\n  See p. 514 and note.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.25:\r\n\r\n  It will fill up the picture of the times to relate the revenge. When\r\n  Jamshid, the infamous lieutenant of the infamous Amir Khan,\r\n  established his headquarters at Udaipur, which he daily devastated,\r\n  Sardar Singh, then in power, was seized and confined as a hostage for\r\n  the payment of thirty thousand rupees demanded of the Rana. The\r\n  surviving brothers of the murdered minister Somji ‘purchased their\r\n  foe’ with the sum demanded, and anticipated his clansmen, who were on\r\n  the point of effecting his liberation. The same sun shone on the head\r\n  of Sardar, which was placed as a signal of revenge over the gateway of\r\n  Rampiyari’s palace. I had the anecdotes from the minister Siyahal, one\r\n  of the actors in these tragedies, and a relative of the brothers, who\r\n  were all swept away by the dagger. A similar fate often seemed to him,\r\n  though a brave man, inevitable during these resumptions; which\r\n  impression, added to the Rana’s known inconstancy of favour, robbed\r\n  him of half his energies.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.26:\r\n\r\n  Nearly twelve months after this, my public duty called me to Nimbahera\r\n  _en route_ to Kotah. The castle of Hamira was within an hour’s ride,\r\n  and at night he was reported as having arrived to visit me, when I\r\n  appointed the next day to receive him. Early next morning, according\r\n  to custom, I took my ride, with four of Skinner’s Horse, and galloped\r\n  past him, stretched with his followers on the ground not far from my\r\n  camp, towards his fort. He came to me after breakfast, called me his\r\n  greatest friend, “swore by his dagger he was my Rajput,” and that he\r\n  would be in future obedient and loyal; but this, I fear, can never be.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.27:\r\n\r\n  Literally faith (_dharma_) to his lord (_swami_).\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.28:\r\n\r\n  Paper of relinquishment.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.29:\r\n\r\n  The _dūb_ grass [_Cynodon dactylon_] flourishes in all seasons, and\r\n  most in the intense heats; it is not only _amara_ or ‘immortal,’ but\r\n  _akshay_, ‘not to be eradicated’; and its tenacity to the soil\r\n  deserves the distinction.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.30:\r\n\r\n  From _bap_, ‘father,’ and the termination of, or _belonging to_, and\r\n  by which clans are distinguished; as Karansot, ‘descended of Karan’;\r\n  Mansinghgot, ‘descended of Mansingh.’ It is curious enough that the\r\n  mountain clans of Albania, and other Greeks, have the same\r\n  distinguishing termination, and the Mainote of Greece and the Mairot\r\n  of Rajputana alike signify _mountaineer_, or ‘of the mountain,’\r\n  _maina_ in Albanian; _mairu_ or _meru_ in Sanskrit. [The words have no\r\n  connexion.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.31:\r\n\r\n  _Laws_, ix. 44.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4.18.32:\r\n\r\n  [“When he [the king] has gained victory, let him duly worship the gods\r\n  and honour righteous Brāhmanas, let him grant exemptions, and let him\r\n  cause promises of safety to be proclaimed.

I never heard an etymology of this word, but imagine it to be\r\n  from _patta_, ‘grant,’ or ‘patent,’ and _sila_, which means a nail, or\r\n  sharp instrument; [? _sila_, the stone on which the grant is\r\n  engraved]; metaphorically, that which binds or unites these patents;\r\n  all, however, having _pati_, or chief, as the basis (see _Transactions\r\n  of the Royal Asiatic Society_, vol. i. p. 237).
