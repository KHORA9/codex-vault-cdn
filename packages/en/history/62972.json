WALLACE,\r\n                 in the year 1897, at Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of the Horse, from the first glimmerings of history, sacred and\r\nprofane, and tracing him from his original home through his migrations\r\nuntil all the peoples of the globe had received their initial supply, may\r\nnot be a new idea, but it is certainly a new undertaking. Horse Books\r\nwithout number have been written, mostly in the century just closing,\r\nbut in the history of the horse they are all alike—merely reproductions\r\nof what had been printed before. So far as my knowledge goes, therefore,\r\nthis volume is the first attempt, in any language, to determine the\r\noriginal habitat of the horse and to trace him, historically, in his\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nThe facts presented touching the introduction of the horse into Egypt,\r\nand two thousand years later into Arabia, as well as the plebeian blood\r\nfrom which the English race horse has derived his great speed, will be a\r\nshock to the nerves of the romanticists of the old world as well as the\r\nnew. Taking the facts of history and well-known experiences together,\r\nmy readers can determine for themselves whether the claims for the\r\nsuperiority of Arabian blood is not pure fiction. For my own part I\r\ncannot recognize any blood in all horsedom as “royal blood” except that\r\nwhich is found in the veins of the horse that “has gone out and done it,”\r\neither himself or in his progeny.\r\n\r\nIn our own country there has always remained a blank in horse history\r\nthat nobody has attempted to supply. This blank embraced a century of\r\nracing of which we of the present generation have been entirely ignorant.\r\nBelieving that a correct knowledge of the horse of the Colonial period,\r\nin his size, gait, qualities and capacities was absolutely essential to\r\nan intelligent comprehension of the phenomena presented on our trotting\r\nand running courses of the present day, I have not hesitated to bestow\r\non this new feature of the work great labor and research. In this I have\r\nfelt a special satisfaction in the fact that while the field is old in\r\ndates, this is the first time it has ever been traversed and considered.\r\n\r\nIn the chapters which follow, many historical questions are treated at\r\nsuch length as their relative importance seems to demand, embracing\r\nthe different families that have contributed to the building up of the\r\nbreed of trotters; and the question of how the trotting horse is bred is\r\ncarefully considered in the light of all past experiences and brought\r\ndown to the close of 1896. These chapters will not surprise the old\r\nreaders of the _Wallace’s Monthly_, for they will here meet with many\r\nthoughts that will not be new to them, but they will find them more\r\nfully elaborated, in more orderly form, and brought down to the latest\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this book to furnish statistical tables covering\r\nthe great mass of trotting experiences, nor to consider the mysteries of\r\nthe trainer’s art that have been so ably discussed by experienced and\r\nskillful men. But the real and only purpose is to place upon record the\r\nresults of years devoted to historical research, at home and abroad; to\r\ndispel the illusions and humbugs that have clustered about the horse\r\nfor many centuries; and to consider with some minuteness, which of\r\nnecessity cannot be impersonal, the great industrial revolution that\r\nhas been wrought in horse-breeding, and all growing out of a little\r\nunpretentious treatise written twenty-five years ago, which contained\r\nnothing more striking than a little bit of science and a little bit of\r\nsense intelligently commingled. The battle between the principles of\r\nthis treatise and selfish prejudices and mental sterility, was long and\r\nbitter, but the truth prevailed, and in the production of the Driving\r\nHorse the teachings of that little paper have placed our country first\r\namong all the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\n                                                         JOHN H.

To say that\r\nthe American Trotter, the phenomenal horse of this century, is descended\r\nfrom a certain horse imported from England in 1788, does not fully meet\r\nthe requirements of the truth, for there are other and very distinctive\r\nelements embodied in his inheritance that are not indebted to that\r\nparticular imported horse. In searching for these undefined elements,\r\nI have found myself in the fields of antiquity, reaching out step by\r\nstep, further and further, until the utmost boundaries of all history,\r\nsacred and profane, were clearly in view. There I found a field that\r\nwas especially attractive because it was a new field, and the relations\r\nof the peoples of the earliest ages to their horses had never been\r\ninvestigated nor discussed. Having no engagements nor necessities to\r\nhurry me, the careful exploration of this hitherto unknown territory has\r\nafforded me very great enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAs the result of these investigations, the breadth and scope of this\r\nvolume will be greatly widened, touching upon the originals of most of\r\nthe lighter types of horses, and many of the idols of the imagination\r\nwill be demolished. The objective point is the history of the Trotting\r\nHorse, but before reaching that point we must consider the beginnings\r\nof, practically, nearly all the varieties of horses in the world. The\r\nassistance that I may be able to gain from modern writers will be very\r\nlimited, and restricted Haicus, the great grandson of Japheth, became\r\nthe ruler of his people. Descending from him, in the direct male line,\r\nthere were five or six long reigns before the dynasty was overthrown by\r\nthe Assyrians. They were largely an agricultural people, and the ancient\r\nhistorians have told us they were famous for the great numbers and fine\r\nquality of the horses they produced. The market for their horses, the\r\nprophet Ezekiel tells us, was in the great commercial city of Tyre,\r\nwhence they were carried “in the ships of Tarshish” by the Phœnician\r\nmerchants to all portions of the known world. Having here reached back to\r\nthe Noachic period and country, with all that this implies, I will leave\r\nthe problem, with the more extended consideration that will be given it\r\nin the chapter on the general distribution of horses in all parts of the\r\ncommercial world.\r\n\r\nHorsemen of average intelligence and writers on the horse, oftentimes\r\nmuch below average intelligence in horse matters, all seem to unite on\r\nthe Arabian horse as their fetish, when in fact they know nothing about\r\nhim. The songs of the poets and the stories of the novelists have taken\r\nthe place, in the minds of the people of all nations, of solid history\r\nand sober experience. When a story writer wishes to depict an athletic\r\nand daring hero, he never fails to mount him upon an “Arab steed,” when\r\nsome blood-curdling adventures are to be disclosed. When Admiral Rous,\r\nthe great racing authority in England, announced some years ago, that\r\nthe English race horse was purely descended from the horses of Arabia\r\nDeserta, without one drop of plebeian blood, all England believed him,\r\nand this rash and groundless dictum has served all writers as conclusive\r\nevidence ever since. Now, it is not probable that more than two or at\r\nmost three per cent. of the blood of the English race horse as he stands\r\nto-day is Arabian blood. The greatness and value of the Arabian horse is\r\npurely mythical. He has been tested hundreds of times, both on the course\r\nand in the stud, and in every single instance he has proved a failure.\r\nThis is what all history and experience teach. There are but few horses\r\nbred in Arabia and there are, comparatively, but few there now. From\r\nthe time of their first introduction into Yemen—Arabia Felix—up to the\r\ntime of Mohammed, about two hundred and seventy years, they were still\r\nvery scarce. Mohammed was not a horseman nor a horse breeder, nor is it\r\nknown that he ever mounted a horse but once, and then he had but two in\r\nhis army. When he made his first pilgrimage to Mecca he rode a camel;\r\nand when he went the second time in triumph, mounted on a camel, he made\r\nthe requisite number of circuits round the holy place, then dismounted\r\nand broke the idols that had been set up there. Then came the triumphant\r\nshout of his followers; “There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his\r\nprophet.” Since then, this cry has rung over a thousand battlefields, and\r\nas I write it is still heard in the homes of the slaughtered Armenians.\r\nFrom a great, warlike, and conquering people, the followers of Mohammed\r\nhave degenerated into an aggregation of robbers and murderers of\r\ndefenseless Christians. Since the days of Mohammed, horses no doubt have\r\nincreased in numbers, but all modern travelers express their surprise at\r\nthe small numbers they see. The horse is an expensive luxury in Arabia,\r\nand none but the rich can afford to keep him. He fills no economic place\r\nin the domestic life of the Arab, for he is never used for any purpose\r\nexcept display and robbery. Nobody is able to own a horse but the sheiks\r\nand a few wealthy men. Nobody would think of mounting a horse for a\r\njourney, be it long or short. The camel fills the place of the horse, the\r\ncow and a flock of sheep, all in one, and surely the Arabs are right in\r\nsaying, “Job’s beast is a monument of God’s mercy.” It is very evident\r\nthat nearly all the horses said to have been brought from Arabia never\r\nsaw Arabia. As an illustration of the uncertainty of what a man is\r\ngetting when he thinks he is buying an Arabian, in the Orient, I will\r\ngive, in some detail the experiences of Mr. Wilfrid S. Blunt, a wealthy\r\nEnglishman who had an ambition to regenerate the English race horse by\r\nbringing in fresh infusions of Arabian blood. He went to Arabia to buy\r\nthe best, but he didn’t go _into_ Arabia to find it. He skirted along\r\nthrough the border land where agriculture and civilization prevailed,\r\nwhile away off to the south the wild tribes roamed over the desert, and\r\nto the north, not far away, was the land of abundance that had been\r\nfamous for more than three thousand years for the great numbers and\r\nexcellence of the horses bred there. Here on the banks of the Euphrates\r\nMr. Blunt found the town of Deyr, and he soon discovered it was a famous\r\nhorse market. The inhabitants were the only people he met with who seemed\r\nto understand and appreciate the value of pedigrees, and there were no\r\nhorses in the town but “thoroughbreds.” Here Mr. Blunt made nearly all\r\nhis purchases which amounted to eighteen mares and two stallions “at\r\nreasonable prices.” As will be seen in the extracts from his book, he\r\nwas strikingly solicitous that the friends at home should have no doubt\r\nabout the quality of the stock he purchased being all “thoroughbred.”\r\nNo doubt he realized the awkwardness of the location as not the right\r\none in which to secure “thoroughbred” Arabians and hence the vigorous\r\nindorsement of the honesty of the “slick and experienced” dealers as\r\nhonest men and true descendants of the Bedouins of the desert. In this\r\n“he doth protest too much” and thus suggests that while the pedigrees\r\ncame from the tribes of the desert to the South, it might be possible\r\nthat the horses came from the farmers who bred them to the North. However\r\nthis may have been, the whole enterprise turned out to be a flat failure,\r\nand after a number of years spent in begging for popular support, the\r\nwhole collection was dispersed under the hammer of the auctioneer, not\r\nrealizing a tithing of the cost.\r\n\r\nWhile it is not necessary that I should express any opinion as to whether\r\nMr. Blunt was deceived in the breeding of the animals which he brought\r\nhome, I will make brief allusion to an American experience which is more\r\nfully considered elsewhere. Some forty or more years ago Mr. A. Keene\r\nRichards, a breeder of race horses in Kentucky, became impressed with the\r\nidea that the way to improve the race horse of America was to introduce\r\ndirect infusions of the blood of Arabia. He did not hesitate, but he\r\nstarted to Arabia and brought home some horses and mares and put them to\r\nbreeding. The pure bloods could not run at all and the half-breeds were\r\ntoo slow to make the semblance of a contest with Kentucky-bred colts. He\r\nconcluded that he had been cheated by the rascally Arabs in the blood\r\nthey put upon him. He then determined to go back and get the right blood,\r\nand as a counselor he took with him the famous horse painter, Troye, who\r\nwas thoroughly up on anatomy and structure. They went into the very heart\r\nof Arabia and spent many weeks among the different tribes of the desert.\r\nThey had greatly the advantage of Mr. Blunt or any other amateur, for\r\nthey were experienced horsemen and knew just what they were doing. When\r\nthey were ready to start home they believed they had found and secured\r\nthe very best horses that Arabia had produced. When the produce of this\r\nsecond importation were old enough to run it was found that they were no\r\nbetter than the first lot, and thus all the bright dreams of enthusiasm\r\nwere dissipated. Thus was demonstrated for the thousandth time that the\r\nblood of even the best and purest Arabian horse is a detriment and\r\nhindrance rather than a benefit to the modern race horse. Mr. Richards,\r\nwith all his practical knowledge and experience, was no more successful\r\nthan the amateur, Mr. Blunt. The blood which Mr. Richards brought\r\nhome was, no doubt, purer and more fashionable, as estimated in the\r\ndesert, than that brought home by Mr. Blunt, but when tested by modern\r\nadvancement it was no better.\r\n\r\nA careful study of the chapter on the English Race Horse will present\r\nto the minds of all my intelligent readers the consideration of several\r\npoints to which they will be slow in yielding assent. These points run\r\nup squarely against the preconceived opinions and prejudices of two\r\ncenturies, and these preconceived opinions and prejudices are well-nigh\r\nuniversal. The first point upon which the public intelligence has gone\r\nwrong is in the general belief that horse-racing had its origin in the\r\nseventeenth century, when Charles II. was restored to his throne. The\r\ntruth is we have accounts of racing by contemporaneous historians in the\r\ntwelfth century, and indeed, we might say from the time of the Romans\r\nin Britain. To go back four centuries, however, is far enough to answer\r\nour present purpose. After selecting, breeding, and racing four hundred\r\nyears we must conclude that the English had some pretty good race horses.\r\nThis is fully verified by the writers at the close of Queen Elizabeth’s\r\nreign as well as at the beginning of Charles II.’s. They had native\r\nEnglish horses that were able to beat all the imported exotics, including\r\nthe Arabian owned by King James. We must, therefore, conclude that the\r\nrace horse was not created by Charles II., but that racing was simply\r\nrevived by him, after the restrictions of Cromwell’s time, and that the\r\nold English blood was the basis of that revival. The importations of so\r\nmany exotics in his reign were simply so many reinforcements of the old\r\nEnglish racing blood.\r\n\r\nThe next point to which exception will be taken is the conclusion reached\r\nas to the character and influence of the exotics that were introduced in\r\nthe reign of Charles II. These exotics have been designated in a general\r\nway, by the phrase “foundation stock,” which has been introduced more\r\nout of deference to the popular understanding than to its legitimate and\r\ntrue meaning. For the real “foundation stock” we must look away back\r\nin the centuries, long before Charles was born. The analysis of the\r\ndata furnished by Mr. Weatherby as “foundation stock” clearly shows\r\nthat the Turks predominated in numbers, but, possibly, the Barbs in\r\ninfluence. The Arabian element, in both numbers and influence, seems\r\nto be practically _nil_, and this is the “gist of my offending.” The\r\none great horse—Godolphin Arabian—exerted a greater and more lasting\r\ninfluence upon the English race horse than any other of his century and\r\nprobably than all the others of his century, and his blood is wholly\r\nunknown. Fortunately, a few years ago I was able to unearth his portrait\r\nand prove it a true portrait, and in that picture we must look for his\r\nlineage. He was a horse of great substance and strength on short legs,\r\nwith no resemblance whatever to a race horse. About fifty years after his\r\ndeath Mr. Stubbs, the artist, who prided himself upon representing the\r\ncharacter of a horse rather than his shape, came across this picture,\r\nfrom which he made an “ideal” copy of what he thought the horse should\r\nhave been, which is a veritable monstrosity. These two pictures will\r\nappear together in their proper places, where they can be leisurely\r\nstudied, and the honest and the dishonest compared.\r\n\r\nThe American race horse is the lineal descendent of the English race\r\nhorse, and like his ancestor he is very largely dependent upon the\r\n“native blood” for his existence as a breed. The first English race horse\r\nwas imported into Virginia about 1750, and he there met a class of saddle\r\nmares that had been selected, bred, trained, and raced at all distances\r\nup to four-mile heats, for nearly a hundred years. These mares were\r\nthe real maternal foundation stock upon which the American race horse\r\nwas established, as a breed. The phrase “native blood” is here used as\r\napplying to the animals and their descendants, that were brought over\r\nfrom England at and soon after the plantation of the American colonies.\r\nUp to the time of the Revolution there were but few racing mares brought\r\nover—as many as you could count on your fingers—but they must have been\r\nmarvelously prolific, for thirty or forty filly foals each would hardly\r\nhave accommodated all the animals with pedigrees tracing to them. Quite\r\na number of our greatest race horses and sires of forty or fifty years\r\nago traced to some one of these mares through links that were wholly\r\nfictitious. Indeed, from the period of the Revolution, and even before\r\nthat, down to our own time, the pernicious and dishonest habit of adding\r\nfictitious crosses beyond the second or third dam became the rule in the\r\nold American families, and an animal with a strictly honest pedigree\r\nwas the exception. In spreading abroad these dishonest fictions as true\r\npedigrees, the press—perhaps not venally, but ignorantly—was made the\r\nactive agent. Whenever a rogue could get a pedigree into print, however\r\nabsurd, nothing could prevent its spread as the truth. The early sporting\r\nand breeding press was not in the hands of men remarkable for conscience\r\nand still less remarkable for knowledge. But the worst of all was the\r\n“professional pedigree maker” who knew so many things that he never knew,\r\nand stopped at nothing. In all this dirty work of manufacturing pedigrees\r\nthere is a very striking resemblance between the awkward efforts of the\r\nearly English and the early American pedigree maker. This whole topic\r\nof the ignorance of the press and the dishonesty of the pedigree makers\r\nwill be considered fully in its proper place. Fortunately, although still\r\nfar from perfect, the methods and care in the preservation of the true\r\nlineage of the race horse in our own day have been greatly improved. The\r\nmany efforts to improve the American race horse by introducing fresh\r\ninfusions of Saracenic blood will receive due attention, especially as\r\nthey have nearly all been made within the newspaper period, and their\r\nuniform and complete failure will not be new to American horsemen.\r\n\r\nWhen we reach the horses of the colonial period, we are in a field\r\nthat never has been explored and cannot be expected to yield a very\r\nrich harvest. Here and there I have been able to pick up a detached\r\nparagraph from some contemporaneous writer, and occasionally a record,\r\nor an advertisement, from which, in most cases, I have been able to\r\nconstruct a fair and truthful outline and description of the horses of\r\nthe different colonies, down to the Revolutionary war. The collection of\r\nthe material has required great patience and great labor, but it has not\r\nbeen an irksome task, for many things have been brought to light of great\r\ninterest to the student of horse history. The knowledge of the colonial\r\nhorse in his character and action, that may be gathered from the chapters\r\ndevoted to his description and history, I flatter myself, will not only\r\nbe interesting as something new, but will throw a strong light on the\r\nlineage of the two-minute trotter and pacer.\r\n\r\nThe colonists of Virginia were subjected for a number of years to great\r\nsuffering, privation, and want. They were badly selected and many of them\r\nwere improvident and never trained to habits of industry and thrift.\r\nThere were quite too many “penniless gentlemen’s sons” among them, who\r\nhad been sent out with the hope that the change might improve their\r\nhabits and their morals. They were too proud to work, and when they were\r\ndriven to it by necessity they didn’t know how. After suffering untold\r\nhardships for a succession of years, those that survived learned to\r\nadapt themselves to their environment and to make their own way in the\r\nworld. Their first supply of domestic animals were all consumed as food,\r\nembracing horses, cattle, swine, and goats, and everything had thus been\r\nconsumed except one venerable female swine, as reported by a board of\r\nexaminers. Their second supply of horses, cattle, swine, and goats was\r\nmore carefully guarded, and from them in greater part came the countless\r\ndenizens of the barnyard.\r\n\r\nThere were several shipments of horses at different times, by the\r\nproprietors in London, down till about 1620 and possibly later, but they\r\ndo not seem to have increased very rapidly, for in 1646 all the horses\r\nin the colony were estimated at about two hundred of both sexes. This\r\nestimate was probably too low, for ten years after this the exportation\r\nof mares was forbidden by legislative enactment, and eleven years later\r\nthis restriction was removed, and both sexes could then be exported. From\r\nthis legislation and from writers who visited the colony we learn that\r\nhorses were very plenty, and they are described as of excellent quality,\r\nhardy and strong, but under size. It was the custom in Virginia, and\r\nindeed in all the other colonies at that period and for long afterward,\r\nto brand their young horses and turn them out to hustle for their own\r\nliving. They increased with wonderful rapidity and great numbers became\r\nas wild and as wary of the habitation and sight of man as the deer of\r\nthe forest. About the close of the seventeenth century the chasing and\r\ncapture of wild horses in Virginia became a legitimate and not always\r\nan unprofitable sport, for an animal caught without a brand became the\r\nunquestioned property of his captor. It is a noteworthy fact that off\r\nthe coast of Virginia the island of Chincoteague has been occupied for\r\nprobably two hundred years by large bands of wild horses. They are\r\nstill there, and not till within the last few decades have there been\r\nany efforts made to domesticate some selections from them. They are of\r\nall colors, but quite uniform in size, not averaging much over thirteen\r\nhands, with clean limbs, and many of them are pacers. There is only one\r\nway to account for them in that location, and that is, that they were\r\noriginally a band of Virginia wild horses that wandered or was chased\r\nout onto this sandy peninsula, and while there some great storm set the\r\nmysterious ocean currents at work and cut off their retreat by converting\r\na peninsula into an island, and there they have lived and multiplied ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nThe colonial horses of Virginia were of all colors and all very small\r\nin size, as we would class them in our day. An examination of a great\r\nmany advertisements of “Strayed,” “Taken up,” etc., of the period of\r\nabout 1750, clearly establishes the fact that at that time the average\r\nheight was a small fraction over thirteen hands and one inch. More were\r\ndescribed as just thirteen hands than any other size, and they were\r\nnearly all between thirteen and fourteen. From this same advertising\r\nsource I was able to glean conclusive evidence as to their habits of\r\naction, and found that just two-thirds of them were natural pacers and\r\none-third natural trotters. Thus for more than a hundred years they\r\nhad retained the peculiarities of their English ancestors in the reign\r\nof James I., in color, size, and gait. This in no way differs from the\r\ndescription of the Chincoteague Island ponies of to-day. As early as 1686\r\na law was enacted that all stallions less than thirteen and a half hands\r\nhigh found running at large should be forfeited; but this, like Henry\r\nVIII.’s laws in the same direction, had failed to increase the average\r\nsize of the horses. From the indomitable passion for horse-racing which\r\nprevailed universally among the colonists, we may safely conclude that\r\nsome animals were carefully selected and coupled with a view to the speed\r\nof the progeny, both at the gallop and at the pace, but the great mass\r\nwere allowed to roam at large, and under such conditions no variety or\r\ntribe of horses has ever improved in size, or indeed in any other quality.\r\n\r\nThe early horses of the Dutch colony of New Netherlands, afterward New\r\nYork, were brought from Utrecht in Holland. As we would look at them\r\nto-day, they were small, but they were larger and better, and brought\r\nhigher prices than the English horses of the Eastern colonies or than\r\nthe Swedish on the West. It was conceded, however, that for the saddle\r\nthey were not so good as the New England horses, and hence it may be\r\ninferred that they were not pacers. It is very evident, however, that the\r\ntwo breeds were soon mixed, as the saddle was then the universal means\r\nof travel, whether for long or short distances. During the time of the\r\nRevolutionary war a large accumulation of data bearing on the size and\r\naction of the horses of that period goes to show that the average size\r\nhad then increased to fourteen hands and one inch, and in gait fifteen\r\nboth paced and trotted, nine trotted only, and seven paced only. It is\r\nnot pretended that these data represent the horses of the early colonial\r\nperiod, but only of the period above indicated. Strains of larger breeds\r\nhad been introduced, but the little New England pacer had made his mark\r\non the habits of action.\r\n\r\nIn 1665, the next year after the Dutch had surrendered the country to\r\nthe English, Governor Nicolls established a race-course on Hempstead\r\nPlains and offered prizes for the fleetest runners, and his successors\r\nkept up annual meetings on that course for many years. This was the first\r\nofficial and regularly organized race-course that we have any trace of\r\nin this country. These meetings seem to have been well supported from\r\nthe very first by both town and country, and as the people were then\r\npractically all Dutch, it is a fair inference that the horses engaged in\r\nthe races were Dutch horses. This was before the English race horse had\r\nreached the character of a breed, and a hundred years before the first of\r\nthat breed was imported into New York. From this beginning many tracks\r\nwere constructed or improvised in and about the city, upon which racing\r\nat all forms and at all gaits has been carried on to the present day.\r\nWhen honestly conducted the sport has always been favorably received by\r\nreputable people; but at successive periods it has degenerated into a\r\nmere carnival of gambling that placed it under a ban.\r\n\r\nThe horses of the New England colonies fill a very important place in the\r\nhorse history of the country. This is especially true of a remarkable\r\ntribe of swift pacers, produced in Rhode Island and known throughout\r\nthe whole country as the “Narragansett Pacers.” To the description of\r\nthese a special chapter will be devoted. The first horses imported into\r\nNew England reached Boston harbor in 1629 and were sent direct from\r\nEngland by the proprietary company in London. The same year a small\r\nconsignment reached Salem. The next year about sixty head were shipped\r\nto the plantation, but many of them were lost on the voyage. In 1635 two\r\nDutch ships landed at Salem with twenty-seven mares and three stallions,\r\nand were sold there at remunerative prices. Other shipments followed,\r\nno doubt, that have not been noted. In 1640 the colonists seem to have\r\nbeen supplied with all the horses they needed, for that year they shipped\r\na cargo of eighty head to the Barbadoes. From these importations into\r\nBoston and Salem, all the New England colonists received their supplies.\r\nThe field specially gleaned to determine the size and gaits of the\r\nMassachusetts horses covered the years 1756-59, from which it appears\r\nthat the average height was then fourteen hands and one inch; and as\r\nto gait, just three-fourths were pacers and one-fourth trotters. In\r\ncomparing this average size with the Virginians of the same period we\r\nfind that the Massachusetts horses were about one hand higher, which\r\nwould indicate the influence of the early Dutch blood. Besides this we\r\nmust make some allowance for a possible different habit of estimating\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nWhen the plantation was made at Hartford, Connecticut, in 1636, the\r\nplanters brought their horses and other domestic animals with them. In\r\n1653 the General Court, at New Haven, made provision for keeping public\r\nsaddle horses for hire, and all horses had to be branded. After passing\r\nover a period of more than a hundred and twenty years we find that in\r\n1776 the average size of the Connecticut horse was thirteen hands and\r\nthree inches, thus ranging below the other New England colonies. At that\r\nperiod it is found that the ratio of pacers and trotters was as fifteen\r\npacers, or trotters and pacers, to four that trotted only. The very\r\ninteresting experience of two English travelers, mounted on Connecticut\r\npacers, in 1769, and their enthusiasm about their superlative qualities,\r\nwill be found in its place.\r\n\r\nThe colony of Rhode Island was planted in 1636 by Roger Williams and his\r\nfollowers, and eleven years later they obtained their charter. Their\r\nsupply of horses came wholly from the colony of Massachusetts, and in\r\na short time the new plantation became greatly distinguished for the\r\nsuperiority and speed of its pacers. From the official report of the\r\ncolony for 1690, we learn that horses constituted their leading item of\r\nexports, and that they were shipping horses to all the colonies of the\r\nseaboard. At that early day the fame of the Narragansett pacer extended\r\nthrough all the English colonies, and probably also through the French\r\nplantations on the St. Lawrence. All trade with Canada was strictly\r\nprohibited, but in the then condition of the borders how could such\r\nregulation be enforced, if a Frenchman, with a bale of peltry, wanted\r\nto exchange it for a Narragansett? Freed from the Puritan restrictions\r\nof New England, of that day, the Rhode Islanders developed the speed\r\nof their pacers by racing them, and thus the best and fastest of all\r\nNew England were collected there. In 1768 the average height of the\r\nNarragansetts was fourteen hands and one inch, which shows them to have\r\nbeen about three and a quarter inches higher than the Virginia horses of\r\nthe same period. They were not all pacers, for out of thirty-five there\r\nwere eight that did not pace, and some others that both trotted and\r\npaced. A full account of these famous pacers will be found in the chapter\r\non the Colonial Horse History of New England, and that on The American\r\nPacer and his Relations to the American Trotter.\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn did not visit his princely gift from Charles II. until 1682,\r\nand it was then under the government of the Duke of York. In giving a\r\ndescription of things as he found them he remarks: “The horses are not\r\nvery handsome, but good,” and this is all he says of them. Knowing that\r\nPennsylvania, in the early part of this century, produced larger and\r\nheavier horses, than any other portion of the country, it was a great\r\nsurprise to me to find the undoubted proof that a hundred years earlier\r\nshe had produced the smallest and the lightest horses of any of the\r\ncolonies. In the first half of the last century the average size of the\r\nhorses of Eastern Pennsylvania was thirteen hands one and a quarter\r\ninches, and they were remarkably uniform in size. This was one-quarter\r\ninch below the average of the Virginians. Of the twenty-eight animals\r\nexamined as to gait, twenty-four of them were natural pacers, three both\r\npaced and trotted, and a single one trotted only. Finding these two facts\r\nof uniformity of size and uniformity of gait together, we are prepared\r\nfor another fact that follows, viz., in Philadelphia the pacers were more\r\npopular and fashionable than in any other city, so far as we can learn,\r\nand they were selected with great care and bred for their speed, and that\r\nspeed was highly tested on the race-course. They were breeding for speed\r\nwithout much regard to size, and hence the uniformity.\r\n\r\nIt has not been discovered that the colonists of New Jersey made any\r\ndirect importations of horses from England. Their original supplies\r\nwere obtained from New York on the one side and Pennsylvania on the\r\nother. From these sources, therefore, we can form a correct estimate of\r\nthe size and gaits of the Jersey horses, without going into particular\r\ninvestigation. The only object, then, in referring to this colony is\r\nto prove that before 1748 all kinds of racing had become so common in\r\nthe colony as to be a nuisance. Consequently the legislative authority\r\npassed an act in 1748 for the suppression of “Running, Pacing and\r\nTrotting Races.” This was in strict harmony with the well-known condition\r\nof things in Philadelphia and vicinity very early in the century. If\r\nthere had been no pacing races there would have been no legislation\r\nsuppressing them.\r\n\r\nThe horses of the colony of Maryland would necessarily partake of the\r\ncharacteristics of Virginia and Pennsylvania, from which she probably\r\nreceived her supply. There seems to be no evidence of direct importation.\r\nThis colony was really the first, in point of time, to legislate for the\r\nsuppression of pacing races. In 1747, one year before New Jersey, an act\r\nwas passed forbidding pacing races in certain locations at certain times,\r\nand the avowed object was the protection of the Friends in holding their\r\nyearly meetings. Here, then, we have historic evidence that the three\r\ncolonies of Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and Virginia had frequent pacing\r\nraces, and legislative evidence that Maryland and New Jersey had quite\r\ntoo many pacing races, early in the last century. It follows, then, that\r\nthe other colonies indulged their sporting fancies in pacing races also.\r\n\r\nThe colonies of North and South Carolina obtained their supply of horses\r\nfrom Virginia, and they possessed the same characteristics as the parent\r\nstock. The first permanent settlement in North Carolina was in 1653, but\r\nbefore this it had become the refuge of Quakers and others fleeing from\r\nthe proscriptions that prevailed in Virginia against all who did not\r\nconform to the English church. South Carolina received her charter in\r\n1663, at a time when horses were beginning to run wild in Virginia. In\r\n1747 thirty horses were advertised in which the size was given, and the\r\naverage is within a small fraction of thirteen and a half hands high, and\r\nin this number two were given as fifteen hands, which was a very large\r\nhorse for that day. The gait is given in only twelve cases—ten of which\r\nwere pacers, one paced and trotted, and one trotted only.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on the “Early Horse History of Canada” is very brief. It\r\nwas not till the year 1665 that the first horses were brought over from\r\nFrance, and as they came from ancient Picardy, right across the Channel\r\nfrom England, it is reasonable to assume that they partook of the same\r\ncharacteristics as the English horses, and that many of them were pacers.\r\nAnother theory of the origin of the Canadian pacer is the probability of\r\nclandestine trading with the New Englanders. Among the many impossible\r\nstories about the breeding of Old Tippoo, the greatest sire of Canada,\r\nthe truth seems to come to the surface at last, and there can be no\r\nreasonable doubt that he was got by “Scape Goat.” However much or little\r\ndependence can be placed upon many of the claims of fast pacing stallions\r\ncoming from Canada, it must be conceded that some of these claims\r\nseem to be well founded, and that the pacing element has been greatly\r\nstrengthened by blood from the other side of the border.\r\n\r\nThe most striking fact in the history of the pacing habit of action is\r\nits great antiquity. The average Englishman of to-day and the average\r\nAmerican of twenty years ago have been united in insisting with the\r\ngreatest vehemence that the pace is not a natural but an acquired gait,\r\nresulting from some injury or malformation. One of the great leaders on\r\nthat side of the discussion called it “structural incongruity” arising\r\nfrom the breeding of the “thoroughbred” horse on the “slab-sided” mares\r\nof the West and South, and thought the idea was unanswerable, but\r\nnever cited any instances to prove it. Now, the truth is, the earliest\r\nunquestioned evidence we have that horses paced is that furnished by\r\nthe chisel of Phidias when he sculptured the horses on the frieze of\r\nthe Parthenon at Athens, and that is two thousand three hundred and\r\nthirty-three years old. From the period when the sons of Japheth turned\r\ntheir attention to horse-breeding on the fruitful plains and valleys in\r\nthe regions of the mountains of Ararat down to this culmination of Greek\r\nart, I have not been able to find any contemporaneous evidence of the\r\nexistence of the lateral habit of action; but as we know it existed more\r\nthan two thousand years ago, we are justified in concluding that among\r\nthe original bands of horses, in their original habitat, pacers as well\r\nas trotters abounded. From the erection of the Parthenon in Athens, the\r\noccupation of Britain by the Romans, and through all the centuries down\r\nto the plantation of the colonies in this country, we have mountains of\r\nindisputable evidence of the antiquity of the pacer. In its place this\r\ntopic will be quite fully discussed.\r\n\r\nThe relation which the pacer bears to the American Trotting Horse has\r\nfor twenty-five years been a topic of much senseless discussion. In the\r\nhistorical sketch which served as an introduction to the first volume\r\nof the “American Trotting Register,” the attention of the breeding\r\npublic was first called to this question, in a form that was somewhat\r\ntentative, and much less didactic than my judgment suggested, but\r\nit served as an introduction to the study of the question which it\r\nforeshadowed. From this initial paragraph grew the discussion that has\r\nbeen going on ever since, much of which has been the merest jargon. The\r\nessential oneness of the trot and the pace has been clearly demonstrated\r\nby thousands of experiences. The trotting inheritance that produces the\r\nfast trotter also produces the fast pacer; and the pacing inheritance\r\nthat produces the fast pacer also produces the fast trotter. The\r\ntrotting-bred John R. Gentry, with his pacing record of a mile in two\r\nminutes and one-half a second, is but a single instance of very many\r\nof the same character. The fastest harness racers in the world are the\r\npacers, and it seems to make no difference whether the inheritance of\r\nspeed comes from the trotter or the pacer. The subject of the pacer in\r\nhis diversified historical relations to the American trotter will be\r\nfound in different portions of this work, and all tending to show the\r\nsignificant fact that he is again rapidly attaining the position of honor\r\namong the equine race which he maintained for so many centuries in the\r\nfar-distant past.\r\n\r\nEarly in this century the American Saddle Horse, the real saddle horse of\r\nall time, past and present, began to vanish from sight. Improved roads\r\nand wheeled vehicles superseded him, in great measure, long before the\r\ndays of railroads. For business and travel he was the sole dependence\r\nof our forefathers for two hundred years, and in point of health it\r\nis a great misfortune that he has gone so completely out of use. The\r\nhorse that cannot take the “saddle gaits” and carry his rider without\r\ndiscomfort or fatigue is not a saddle horse. Springing up and down at\r\nevery revolution of the horse is not riding for pleasure, but to avoid\r\npunishment and a torpid liver. In the chapter devoted to his description,\r\norigin, and breeding, it will be clearly shown that he is indebted to\r\nhis pacing ancestry of the past centuries for his saddle gaits. As the\r\nmere matter of great speed cuts no figure in the qualifications of a\r\nsaddle horse there is a wide field here for the production of style and\r\nbeauty in the breeder’s art. The aims of a goodly number of intelligent\r\nbreeders are now moving in this direction, and with the foundations so\r\nwell laid as they now are, we can look forward to a grand superstructure.\r\nAs the breeder of speed at the trot goes to the horse that can do it\r\nhimself, and as the breeder of speed at the gallop goes to the horse\r\nthat can beat all the others, so the breeder of the saddler will go to\r\nthe handsomest and best of all his tribe, and when we reach the horse\r\nthat is perfect in symmetry, style, quality, and disposition, he will\r\nbe a saddle horse and no questions will be asked about what particular\r\ncombinations of blood he may possess. He will be strictly eclectic, with\r\nthe one exception of the inheritance of gait, and he will be the result\r\nof wise choosing in his size and structure, and of skillful handling in\r\nhis disposition and manners.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Horse of the plains and pampas of North and South America was\r\nat one time an object of great interest and curiosity with all our\r\npeople. No schoolboy of sixty or seventy years ago knew any lesson\r\nin his geography so well as the one which pictured and described the\r\nmillions of wild horses that roamed over the Western plains. In the\r\nfield of imagination and exaggerated fiction he was a fairly good second\r\nto the Arabian—both arrant humbugs, at least so far as their merits\r\nhave been tested. In the past, the question has sometimes been asked,\r\ntentatively, whether the horse may not have been indigenous on this\r\ncontinent? The paleontologists have undertaken to answer this question\r\nin the affirmative and have produced the bones of what they call the\r\nhorse to prove it. This “horse” is scant fifteen inches high and he has\r\nthree, four or five toes on each foot. These toes resemble “claws” more\r\nthan anything else. They tell us these little animals flourished over\r\ntwo millions of years before man was placed on the earth, and that they\r\nare now found imbedded in the solid rock, say two hundred feet below the\r\ngeneral surface. The outline drawing of horses on works supposed to have\r\nbeen erected by a prehistoric and lost race, and also the linguistic\r\nquestion as to whether any of the oldest Indian tribes had any word\r\nrepresenting the horse, will be fully considered, with that presented\r\nby the paleontologists, in the chapter devoted to the Wild Horse. Too\r\nmuch prominence has been given to the horses of Cortez in his conquest\r\nof Mexico, as the progenitors of the American wild horse. He had very\r\nfew horses in his command, and it is very doubtful whether any of them\r\nescaped the slaughter of battle and found a home in the wilderness.\r\nThe horses in the army of the unfortunate Ferdinand De Soto, that\r\nwere abandoned on the confines of Texas, after his death, became the\r\nprogenitors of all the wild horses of North America.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable pre-eminence to which Messenger attained as the founder\r\nof a great race of trotters, in his own right and by his own power,\r\nand more especially as he was the only English-imported running horse\r\nthat ever showed any tendency whatever in that direction, the study of\r\nMessenger’s lineage becomes a question of very great interest and value\r\nto all students of trotting history. His sire, Mambrino, was a great\r\nrace horse, and was distinguished above all others of his generation, or\r\nindeed of any other generation, before or since, as the progenitor of a\r\ntribe of coach horses of great excellence and value. In addition to this,\r\nthe evidence seems to be conclusive that he had a natural and undeveloped\r\ntrotting step that far surpassed that of all other running horses of his\r\nday. His sire, Engineer, was notoriously short on the side of his dam,\r\nand his grandsire, Sampson, was a half-breed of great size and bone, and\r\nran some winning races, in the best of company, for that day.\r\n\r\nThe history of Messenger himself is still clouded in mystery, and the\r\nblood he inherited from his dam remains hopelessly unknown. The identity\r\nof his importer and owner has never been established, which of itself\r\nthrows a suspicion upon the pedigree that is said to have come with him.\r\nHe ran several races at Newmarket, England, and proved himself a second\r\nor third-rate race horse. The racing records there show that he was by\r\nMambrino, and that is all that is known about his inheritance. He left\r\na few tolerably good race horses, for their time, but he filled the\r\ncountry with the best road and driving horses that the horsemen of this\r\ncountry had ever known. A chapter each to Messenger’s ancestors and to\r\nhimself will be found in their proper places in this volume. The twenty\r\nyears of Messenger’s life and service in this country fell in a period\r\nof indifference to all kinds of racing except running. The English race\r\nhorse was then the popular idol, and it is not known that any of his sons\r\nor daughters were ever trained to trot. Neither can it now be certainly\r\ndetermined that any of them were disposed to pace, but if we may judge\r\nof the habits of action of his immediate progeny by what we know of\r\nsucceeding generations, we can hardly doubt that there were pacers among\r\nthem. As the custom then was, and as it so remained for at least half a\r\ncentury later, all pacers were hidden away from public sight, as they\r\nwere supposed to furnish evidence of ignoble breeding.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on “The Sons of Messenger” will be long, but it will be of\r\nexceeding interest. They constitute the connecting link that brings\r\ntogether the peculiar trotting instincts of the sire and develops them\r\nin their own progeny. Several of them were not only trained to run,\r\nbut did run successfully. It is not known that any of his sons was\r\never trained to trot, but it is known from contemporaneous evidence\r\nthat several of them were fast natural trotters, notably Bishop’s\r\nHambletonian, Bush Messenger, Winthrop Messenger, Mambrino, etc., all of\r\nwhich will be considered in their proper place. When we reach the second\r\nremove from Messenger we begin to enter into the full fruition of all the\r\npromises, and in considering such animals as Abdallah, Almack, Mambrino\r\nPaymaster, Harris’ Hambletonian, etc., we begin to feel that we are well\r\nwithin the trotting latitudes, for this remove began to found families\r\nand tribes that attracted the attention of all intelligent breeders.\r\n\r\nIn the next remove from Messenger we strike the most famous of all\r\ntrotting progenitors in Rysdyk’s Hambletonian. At one time there was an\r\nactive and determined difference of opinion among breeders as to which\r\nof three horses, Hambletonian, Ethan Allen, or Mambrino Chief, would in\r\nthe end prove to be the most successful sire. This controversy may not\r\nbe remembered by the younger of the present generation of horsemen, but\r\nit was bitter and uncompromising, and it presents a lesson so important\r\nthat it may be here referred to. The adherents of Ethan Allen argued\r\nthat as he was handsomer, that his gait was the very perfection of\r\ntrotting action, and that he was incomparably faster than either of the\r\nother two, he must of necessity prove the most successful in begetting\r\ntrotters. The adherents of Mambrino Chief used the same argument, with\r\nthe exception of beauty and style, and dwelt strongly on the fact that he\r\nwas a faster horse than Hambletonian, and would consequently get faster\r\noffspring. Both these arguments were good, so far as they went, but they\r\nlacked completeness and hence were not sound. Neither Ethan Allen nor\r\nMambrino Chief had a dam, and so far as we know the inheritance of both\r\nwas restricted to the male side of the house. Development of speed is\r\na valuable and real qualification in any sire, but all experience goes\r\nto show that it is only a help to an inheritance. Hambletonian was not\r\nmuch developed, but it is conceded on all hands that he could show a\r\n2:40 gait at any time and that his action was very perfect. He was got\r\nby a grandson of Messenger, whose dam, Amazonia, was one of the fastest\r\nmares of her generation, whatever her blood may have been. Abdallah got\r\nmore and faster trotters than any other grandson of Messenger, and his\r\ndaughters were very famous as the producers of trotters. Hambletonian’s\r\ndam, the Kent Mare, was by imported Bellfounder, a horse that got no\r\ntrotters practically, but this mare was the fastest four-year-old of\r\nher time, and that because she was out of a very fast mare, One Eye,\r\nthat was a double granddaughter of Messenger. That is, One Eye was by\r\nHambletonian, the son of Messenger, and out of Silvertail, a daughter of\r\nMessenger. This double Messenger mare was unknown to the trotting turf,\r\nbut she was well known throughout Orange County as a remarkably fast\r\ntrotter. Hence Hambletonian not only possessed more Messenger blood than\r\nany horse of his generation, but that blood came to him through developed\r\ntrotters, and he had a right to surpass all competitors, especially the\r\ntwo that were, at one time, the most prominent.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the sons of Hambletonian, as shown by the tabular statistics\r\nwhich will be introduced, became greater than their sire, not only in\r\ngetting trotters from their own loins, but in transmitting the trotting\r\ninstinct to their descendants. The growth and spread of this family\r\nis far and away beyond any precedent that can be cited in any age or\r\ncountry, and is simply marvelous. It is said that fully ninety per cent.\r\nof the fast trotters now on the turf have more or less of the blood of\r\nHambletonian in their veins, and I think it is a safe conclusion to say\r\nthat no intelligent breeder in all the country is trying to produce\r\ntrotters without it. All the other tribes are dropping out of sight,\r\nand at the present ratio of rise and fall it will be but a few years\r\ntill every trotter on the turf will be credited in some degree to the\r\none really great progenitor, Hambletonian. The other tribes will not be\r\nblotted out nor will their merits be lost, but absorbed into the mightier\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\nSuch families as the Bashaws, the Clays, the Black Hawks, the Mambrino\r\nChiefs, the Pilots, the American Stars, the Blue Bulls, etc., will be\r\nfully considered through several chapters, according to their strength\r\nand merit. As these families have not been able to hold their own in\r\nthe rush to the front, and as they seem to be falling further to the\r\nrear in the number and quality of their performers each succeeding year,\r\nwe may as well begin to designate them as “the minor families.” Their\r\ninheritance was feeble and unsatisfactory, and more or less sporadic, and\r\nwe never had any right to expect a brilliant and permanent success from\r\nsuch beginnings.\r\n\r\nAs the investigation of disputed, spurious and fraudulent pedigrees\r\nwas a prime necessity in order to reach safe and honest grounds upon\r\nwhich to build up a breed of trotters, much of my time through all my\r\neditorial life was devoted to this kind of investigation. From the first\r\npage of the first volume of the “Register” I was deeply impressed with\r\nthe importance of having all pedigrees absolutely correct, and this\r\nimpression grew into a vital conviction that without this a breed of\r\ntrotters never could be established. I soon found that I had accepted\r\nfrom some breeders of the very highest respectability a goodly number of\r\npedigrees that were thoroughly rotten in their extensions. This taught\r\nme that I must study the moral fiber of breeders critically, as well as\r\ntheir pedigrees, and that from the highest to the lowest. Some men are\r\nhonest from principle and because it is right to be honest, while others\r\nare honest because “honesty is the best policy.” Some men are dishonest\r\nbecause of ignorance, others because they were born cheats, but the\r\nmost dangerous of all rogues is the man who will utter a false pedigree\r\nand then prove it by trained witnesses who, for half a dollar, can\r\nremember whatever is necessary and forget whatever might be against their\r\nemployer’s interest. By this kind of evidence a man can prove anything.\r\nNot very long ago a man proved that a certain mare came out of a certain\r\nother mare, and when that was shown to be impossible he turned round and\r\nproved (?) that she was out of another mare, and there was just as much\r\ntruth in the one as the other, and not a single word of truth in either.\r\nSo long as there are men in the world there will be rogues among them,\r\nbut the intelligence of the public in breeding matters has so greatly\r\nadvanced that many an honest man would begin to doubt his own sanity if\r\nhe were even to think of breeding in lines that he was once ready to\r\nfight for as the only right and successful way to breed. The brainless\r\nadvocacy of “more running blood in the trotter,” was substantially the\r\nbasis of the whole brood of dishonest pedigrees, against which it became\r\nmy duty to wage war; but to-day no intelligent man in all the land can be\r\nfound to advocate any such balderdash unless it be in the foolish support\r\nof thoughtless opinions previously expressed.\r\n\r\nThe subject of “How the Trotting Horse is Bred,” is a most interesting\r\none because it is entirely new in animal economy and is distinctively\r\nAmerican. The initial thought that opened the door to the practical and\r\nscientific consideration of the subject was the happy conception, in the\r\nspring of 1872, of the little phrase, “Trotting Instinct.” Following this\r\nwith the definition of the word “instinct” as being “the sum of inherited\r\nhabits,” the term expressed in two words and the definition of it in five\r\nwords, put the whole subject in a form that was easily comprehensible and\r\nflashed upon the mind as thoroughly practical. This little phrase, with\r\nits definition, when once comprehended, is a very complete epitome of all\r\nthat has been taught and all that has been learned of the art of breeding\r\nthe trotter. It not only embraces, but requires, the trotting inheritance\r\nas the only starting point, which must be strengthened and the instinct\r\nintensified by the development of the speed of succeeding generations.\r\nIt stood some years at the parting of the ways between intelligence and\r\nignorance, between enlightened judgment and stupid prejudice, between\r\nhonesty and dishonesty, but now it is accepted, in practice, as the\r\nuniversal law from one end of the land to the other. Thus, we have\r\nnot only added millions to the wealth of the country, but without any\r\noutside assistance or instruction we have produced a horse that by way of\r\npre-eminence, throughout the world, is justly entitled to be designated,\r\n“The Horse of America.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nORIGINAL HABITAT OF THE HORSE.\r\n\r\n    No indications that the horse was originally wild—The steppes\r\n    of High Asia and Arabia not tenable as his original home—Color\r\n    not sufficient evidence —Impossibility of horses existing in\r\n    Arabia in a wild state—No horses in Arabia until 356 A.D.—Large\r\n    forces of Armenian, Median, and Cappadocian cavalry employed\r\n    more than one thousand seven hundred years B.C.—A breed of\r\n    white race horses—Special adaptability of the Armenian country\r\n    to the horse—Armenia a horse-exporting country before the\r\n    Prophet Ezekiel—Devotion of the Armenian people to agricultural\r\n    and pastoral pursuits through a period of four thousand\r\n    years—All the evidences point to ancient Armenia as the center\r\n    from which the horse was distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn undertaking to consider and determine what particular portion of the\r\nearth was the original habitat of the horse, we must not forget that we\r\nare in a field that antedates all history, both sacred and profane. When\r\nwe have gone back to the very first dawnings of historical records we\r\nare still far short of the period in which initial light can be reached.\r\nIn profane history, with more or less safety, we can get back to a point\r\nabout seventeen hundred years before the Christian era; and in sacred\r\nhistory about two hundred years less. At both of these dates the horses\r\nreferred to were not in a feral state, but were the companions and\r\nservants of man.\r\n\r\nThere have been two separate theories advanced which demand some\r\nattention, because of the eminence and learning of the men who have\r\nadvanced them. The first is that the original habitat of the horse was\r\non the steppes of High Asia, east and north of the Caspian and the Black\r\nSea. The only argument I have ever seen advanced in support of this\r\ntheory is based upon the great number of wild horses that are found in\r\nthat part of the world, and that so many of them are of a dun color.\r\nFrom the frequency of the recurrence of the dun color another theory has\r\nsprung up to the effect that the original color of the horse was dun,\r\nand hence it is argued that when the dun color appears in our own day\r\nit must be taken as evidence that the original color of the horse was\r\ndun. This reasoning is very far from being conclusive, for there are dun\r\nhorses and dun tribes in all breeds, just as there are greys, and the\r\ncolor is just as liable to be transmitted as any other color. In the\r\nlast century there were many dun horses in England, and at least one of\r\nthat color was advertised very widely as “the Dun Arabian,” probably a\r\nforeign horse, but it is hardly possible that he was an Arabian. It was\r\nthen the custom of the country to call all foreign horses “Arabians,” no\r\ndifference from what part of the world they came. It has been stated on\r\nwhat seemed to be good authority that a dun horse once won the Derby,\r\nbut whether the color may result from line breeding or from atavistic\r\ntendencies, the argument advanced does not seem to have any weight in it\r\nfor the purpose intended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARMENIA, CAPPADOCIA, NORTHERN SYRIA ETC.\r\n\r\nABOUT 1200 B.C.]\r\n\r\nAnother argument in favor of the wild and unknown regions east and north\r\nof the Caspian as the habitat of the horse has been urged with much\r\nmore power and effect. It has been accepted and reiterated by so many\r\nlearned men, one after another, that I doubted the wisdom of attempting\r\nto overthrow it, until I found the spot in which it was fatally weak.\r\nThis view of the question seems to rest upon the fact that the successive\r\nhosts of Barbarians that overran Europe in the early centuries of the\r\nChristian era brought their horses, as well as their flocks and herds,\r\nwith them, and it is assumed that these horses were the first brought\r\ninto Europe. This involves a total misconception of dates; not of a few\r\nyears merely, but of many centuries. All of Europe, including Britain,\r\nand all of Northern Africa, were abundantly supplied with horses,\r\nprobably a thousand years before the first destructive wave of Barbarians\r\ntouched Europe. Linguistic and ethnological facts clearly prove that\r\nthose people came from Asia, and possibly from a part of Asia where\r\nthere were horses running wild, but that does not prove that they came\r\nfrom the original habitat of the horse. With no dates, either definite\r\nor approximate, to support this theory, and with no specific portion\r\nof the earth fixed upon as the general locality from which they came,\r\nit resolves itself into a mere speculation with nothing to support it,\r\nexcept the fact that different writers have been copying it from one\r\nanother, without throwing any additional light upon it, for a number of\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable and at the same time the most untenable of all the\r\nclaims that have been urged about the horse is that he was indigenous\r\nin Arabia. We can tolerate any number of foolish claims set up to show\r\nthat the Arabian horse is superior to all others, for such assertions\r\ncan be tested and disproved, as they have been a thousand times, but\r\nthe claim that Arabia was the original habitat of the horse is so\r\nutterly preposterous, and yet so widely advocated by writers and others\r\nwho know nothing about it, that we must consider it with some brief\r\ndeliberation. When the maimed and crippled horses of De Soto were turned\r\nloose and abandoned on the plains of Texas, they had all around them\r\nthe means of an abundant and healthy subsistence, and they multiplied\r\nand grew into an innumerable host that made the earth tremble when they\r\nmoved in great masses. Under the same favorable conditions of water\r\nand pasture, the same results followed on the pampas of South America.\r\nUpon the early settlement of Virginia, as well probably as in some of\r\nthe other colonies, and within two hundred years, many of the horses of\r\nthe colonists strayed away, became wild and remained so, propagating\r\nand increasing for generations, and until the growing numbers of their\r\nformer masters captured or exterminated them. The varied herbage of the\r\nforest and its grassy swales, and streams of pure water everywhere, made\r\nVirginia a paradise for the horse in his feral state.\r\n\r\nBuffon, the French naturalist of a hundred and fifty years ago, notices\r\nthe theory of the wild horses of Arabia, but he is careful not to\r\ncommit himself nor indorse it in any form. In Vol. I., p. 237, he says:\r\n“According to Mannol, the Arabian horses are descended from the wild\r\nhorses in the deserts of Arabia, of which, in ancient times, large\r\nstuds were formed,” etc. In going further, to find where Mannol got his\r\ninformation, it appears that somebody, with an unpronounceable name that\r\nI have forgotten, told him so. Major Upton, a very intelligent but very\r\ncredulous modern writer on what he saw and learned in the desert, says\r\nhe never heard of this story of wild horses in Arabia, and pronounces it\r\na “fallacy.” When we consider that Arabia never was conquered and the\r\nreason why, although Rome, at the very culmination of her power, followed\r\nby Assyria and Egypt, all failed of their purpose without meeting an\r\nenemy in battle, we must accept the fact that nature had interposed\r\na barrier that military power could not surmount. The barrenness and\r\naridity of the desert has always protected the Arabs against the most\r\npowerful armies of the mightiest nations. Now, to maintain that wild\r\nhorses could not only live, but flourish and increase, in a country\r\nwhere there was not enough edible herbage on a thousand acres to keep\r\na grasshopper alive, and not a running stream of water within five\r\nhundred miles, requires a measure of mental sterility that can be found\r\nnowhere but among a few of the writers on the Arabian horse. Of all\r\nthe curiosities in which the literature of the Arabian horse abounds\r\nand in the multitudinous efforts to give him the primacy among horses,\r\nthere seems to be nothing quite so absurd as this story about his being\r\nindigenous to the desert. Animals in a wild state are never found except\r\nin countries and districts where the conditions surrounding provide them\r\nwith food and water. How long would a band of strong, healthy horses live\r\nif turned loose to seek their own subsistence in the desert of Arabia?\r\nOf all the countries on the face of the globe there is no one where the\r\nhorse is so completely dependent upon, the care and support of his master\r\nas Arabia.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we are not left for data to unwritten traditions two\r\nthousand years old, nor to the fervid imaginations of a race of\r\ncutthroats and thieves of the very lowest order of civilization,\r\nbut we can turn, with full confidence, to authentic contemporaneous\r\nhistory, from which we can settle this question, at once and for all\r\ntime. Strabo, the great Greek geographer and philosopher, flourished\r\nin the reign of Augustus, at the very beginning of the Christian era.\r\nHe describes Arabia just as we know it to-day, for all countries have\r\nchanged in their boundaries and government except Arabia. He describes\r\nthe people as chiefly nomadic, and as breeders of camels. The most\r\nremarkable thing in this description is the fact, found in his great\r\nwork, Vol. III., p. 190, that they had no horses at that time. The exact\r\nlanguage used in this statement will be found in the next chapter of\r\nthis work. The question now arises, If there were no horses in Arabia\r\nat the beginning of the Christian era, when and how did they become\r\npossessed of them? Fortunately, again, written history supplies the\r\nanswer to this question. In my next chapter will be found, quoted at\r\nsome length, the circumstances bearing on this question. In brief, the\r\nfacts are as follows: Philostorgius, a distinguished Greek theologian,\r\nwrote an ecclesiastical history in the fifth century which is no longer\r\nextant. Photius, at one time Patriarch of Constantinople, in the ninth\r\ncentury wrote an epitome of the work by Philostorgius and to this\r\nepitome we are indebted for the facts we here relate. Constantius, at\r\nthe time of which Philostorgius wrote, was on the throne of the Eastern\r\nempire, and was exceedingly zealous in spreading and strengthening the\r\nChristian religion. He learned that the prince of Arabia Felix (that\r\npart of Arabia which we will designate by its modern name Yemen) was\r\nstrongly disposed to come out with his people and embrace Christianity.\r\nConstantius thereupon determined to encourage both prince and people in\r\nthe movement they were contemplating, and he sent them a grand embassy\r\nwith many valuable presents, the most noted of which were two hundred\r\n“well-bred Cappadocian horses.” The embassy was completely successful,\r\nand Theopholis, who had been made a bishop and placed at the head of it,\r\nremained there several years. This was in the year 356 of the Christian\r\nera, and is the first intimation we have in all history of horses in\r\nArabia. These are the facts, so far as any facts are known, upon the\r\nconsideration of which I am not able to assent to the claim that either\r\nHigh Asia or Arabia was the original habitat of the horse.\r\n\r\nI have been surprised at the number of coincidences that seem to point\r\nto ancient Armenia as the first habitation of the horse. This country\r\nat one time was a very powerful kingdom, extending from the mountains\r\nof Caucasus on the north to Media or Assyria on the south, and from\r\nthe Caspian Sea on the east to the Euphrates on the west, and at one\r\ntime even to the Mediterranean. It was intersected by several ranges of\r\nmountains and not only gave rise to the Euphrates and the Tigris, but to\r\na number of smaller rivers. It was well watered everywhere, and produced\r\nin great abundance all varieties of herbage, cereals, and fruits. It\r\nwas originally called Ararat by the Hebrews, probably after a range of\r\nmountains about central to the territory embraced, and because Noah’s Ark\r\nrested somewhere “on the mountains of Ararat.” It is also called Togarmah\r\nin Scripture, after Torgom, son of Gomer, who was the son of Japheth,\r\nthe son of Noah. Japheth seems to have been the oldest son of Noah, and\r\nhe chose this fruitful region as the future home of his descendants.\r\nThe Rev. Michael Chamich, a native Armenian, went back into the old\r\nArmenian records, translated the language as originally used, and wrote\r\na history of the country from its first settlement; and this history has\r\nbeen Englished by Johannes Adval, another native Armenian, and published\r\nin Calcutta in 1827. This work seems to be worthy of credence, and it\r\nclearly establishes the lineal descent of the governing family back to\r\nJapheth, the son of Noah. The order of succession as the head of the\r\ntribe continues through several generations unbroken, from father to\r\nson. Gomer, the son of Japheth, was succeeded by his son Togarmah, then\r\nfollowed Haicus, Armenac, Aramais, Amassia, Gelam, Harma, Aram, Arah, who\r\nwas slain in battle, his son Cardus (at twelve years old), Anushaven, who\r\ndied without issue and was succeeded by Paret, who reigned fifty years\r\nand during his reign the patriarch Joseph died in Egypt, B.C. 1635. These\r\nprinces all had long reigns. Haicus was the first of the line to assume\r\nthe title of king, and he was greatly distinguished for extending the\r\nboundaries of his kingdom. Gelam extended his borders to the Caspian.\r\nAram was fifty-eight years on the throne, during which time he had a war\r\nwith the Medes, and also with the Cappadocians, in both of which he had\r\na large force of cavalry in the field. This was about seventeen hundred\r\nyears before the Christian era, and is the first mention of cavalry that\r\nI have found in history, either sacred or profane. In both these wars\r\nhis cavalry was met by the cavalry of the enemy, equal to or greater\r\nthan his in numbers. How long before this troops may have been mounted\r\non horses it is impossible to say, but from the numbers so used at that\r\nperiod of the world by the neighboring nations and tribes, as the Medes,\r\nthe Cappadocians, etc., it is fair to conclude that the horse had then\r\nbeen an important factor in all military movements for many generations.\r\nWhen we consider two opposing armies, each provided with divisions of\r\nfive thousand cavalry, the period being about B.C. 1700, with no dates\r\nbeyond that are known as relating to the horse, we are shut up to our own\r\nreasoning as to the number of centuries that may have been required to\r\nproduce these great numbers. It must have been at least one century, or\r\nit may have been three or four, and this would carry us back to the head\r\nof the house of Japheth.\r\n\r\nIf we accept Egyptian chronology, which still lacks much of being\r\nreliable, one of the Pharaohs, named Thutmosis I., invaded Syria, passing\r\nup through Palestine till he reached the latitude of Aleppo, and then\r\nturned eastward and crossed the Euphrates. His campaign was successful;\r\nhe fought many battles and returned laden with spoils, especially horses\r\nand chariots of war. This was before the Israelites reached the promised\r\nland, and before Joshua’s battle with the “Northern kings,” in which\r\nthey had “horsemen and chariots very many,” and which is the earliest\r\nScriptural instance in which horses were employed in battle.\r\n\r\nThe territory embracing the ancient countries of Eastern Asia Minor,\r\nbounded on the north by the Black Sea and the Caucasian mountains, on\r\nthe south by the thirty-seventh degree of north latitude, and extending\r\nto the Caspian Sea, has always been remarkable for the variety, value,\r\nand abundance of its agricultural products. Many of the very early\r\nhistorians have noted the fact that each one of the countries embraced\r\nin this territory was distinguished for the excellence and numbers of\r\nhorses produced, and they appear in about the following order, namely,\r\nArmenia, Cappadocia, Cilicia, Media. The last-named country embraced\r\nwhat is now the northern part of Persia, and as between the “Medes”\r\nand the “Persians” there is no little confusion in the public mind, as\r\nsometimes one was on top and sometimes the other. Then, to add to the\r\nconfusion, the Assyrians came in, occupying the same country and the same\r\ncapitals. For our present purposes it is not necessary to enter into the\r\nconsideration of these successive dynasties. The Medes were comparatively\r\nnewcomers, and as they were a great military people their prominence\r\nin horse history resulted more from the spoils of war and the tribute\r\nin horses that they collected from their neighbors than from their own\r\nproduction. Kitto says that in the time of the Persian empire the plain\r\nof Nissæum was celebrated for its horses and horse races. This plain was\r\nnear the city of Nissæa, around which were fine pasture lands, producing\r\nexcellent clover. The horses were “entirely white” (probably grey) and\r\nof extraordinary height and beauty, as well as speed. They constituted\r\npart of the luxury of the great, and a tribute in kind was paid from them\r\nto the monarch, who, like all Eastern sovereigns, used to delight in\r\nequestrian display. Some idea of the opulence of the country may be had\r\nwhen it is known that, independently of imposts rendered in money, Media\r\n(then the undermost dog), paid a yearly tribute of not less than three\r\nthousand horses, four thousand mules, and nearly one hundred thousand\r\nsheep. The races, once celebrated through the world, seem to exist no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nWhen Darius the Mede had extended his empire over the whole of Western\r\nAsia and Egypt, he exacted heavy tribute in horses from all subjugated\r\nprovinces. This was about 520 B.C., and antedated the racing referred\r\nto above. In all parts of his extended empire he built roads and\r\nestablished lines of couriers, mounted on fleet horses, that there\r\nmight be no delay in receiving at his capital and sending out again\r\nintelligence of what was transpiring in any part of his dominions. For\r\nthis service the best and fleetest horses were required, and the only\r\nguide we have to determine how these horses were selected we find in\r\nthe fact that the tribute collected from the little kingdom of Cilicia,\r\nformerly a part of Cappadocia, was, in addition to a stated sum of money,\r\none white horse for every day in the year. It is possible that these\r\nwhite Cilician horses may have been the progenitors of the white (grey)\r\nrace horses spoken of in Media.\r\n\r\nIn describing the general fruitfulness of Cappadocia, Strabo says:\r\n“Cappadocia was also rich in herds and flocks, but more particularly\r\ncelebrated for its breed of horses.” Strabo speaks of this as a leading\r\ncharacteristic of the country and doubtless it had held pre-eminence in\r\nthis respect for generations before he wrote. Three hundred and fifty-six\r\nyears later, when Constantius was selecting his presents of horses for\r\nthe prince and people of Yemen, in Arabia, he knew just where to look, in\r\nall his dominions, for the best of their kind, and selected two hundred\r\n“well-bred” ones for Arabia. Sir R. Wilson, in discussing the quality\r\nof the Russian cavalry horses about 1810, had evidently heard of this\r\nCappadocian origin of the Arabian horse, but, unfortunately, he got all\r\nthe parties badly mixed in his reference. He makes Constantine instead\r\nof Constantius the donor of three hundred Cappadocian horses, instead of\r\ntwo hundred, and they are given to one of the African princes, instead of\r\nto an Arabian prince. The African traveler, Bruce, found some excellent\r\nhorses in Nubia, Africa, and from their high quality and unusually large\r\nsize he seems to have jumped to the conclusion that these were the\r\ndescendants of the three hundred from Constantine.\r\n\r\nAfter glancing over all the different countries in this great zone as\r\ndefined above, and extending from the Bosphorus to the Caspian Sea, one\r\ncannot fail to be impressed with its special adaptation to the production\r\nand sustenance of all varieties of domestic animals, in their greatest\r\nperfection. Here the country seems to have been made for the horse, and\r\nthe horse for the country. Here was a country suited to his nativity, and\r\nhere we find records of his existence centuries earlier than in any other\r\ncountry. The wild ass flourished in this country, but I have not been\r\nable to find any evidence or indication that the horse was not always\r\nthe companion and servant of man. Wherever he is found in a feral state\r\nreasons that are amply satisfactory are never wanting to account for that\r\nstate. Ancient historians have specially noted each of the principal\r\ncountries embraced in this zone for the superiority and numbers of its\r\nhorses, but no one has made any allusion to wild horses, nor suggested\r\nthat there may have been a time when their ancestors were wild.\r\n\r\nNow, as we have designated a long and wide region of Western Asia,\r\nembracing a number of different nationalities and governments, as the\r\nprobable original habitat of the horse, can we go further and designate\r\nthe particular nationality or government in which was his original home\r\nand from which he was distributed to adjoining nations or peoples? In\r\nanswer to this question, we cannot present any dates of record earlier\r\nthan about 1700 B.C., and this date will apply as well to Media and\r\nCappadocia as to Armenia. We must, therefore, consider it in the light of\r\nother facts and circumstances, not dependent upon specific dates. In the\r\nfirst place, and taking the Mosaic account of the deluge as the starting\r\npoint, “the ark rested on the mountains of Ararat.” This is the original\r\nname of a country, intersected by a mountain range, and that range took\r\nits name from the country in which it was found. “Mount Ararat” was\r\nsimply a very high peak in that range. The distinction should be observed\r\nhere between “the mountains of Ararat” and “Mount Ararat.” In the second\r\nplace, it is clearly established by all history that near the base of\r\nthis mountain range Japheth and his descendants had their homes. His son\r\nGomer was highly distinguished in his day, and his grandson, Togarmah,\r\nson of Gomer, became a powerful chief. To such prominence did he rise in\r\nthe affairs of his age that for centuries after his day his country was\r\ncalled “Togarmah.” Hence we have the three names, Ararat, Togarmah and\r\nArmenia applied in sacred and profane history to the same country that we\r\nare now considering.\r\n\r\nDuring the continuance of the dynasty of King Haic or Haicus, the son of\r\nTogarmah, the Armenians became a very prosperous and powerful people.\r\nThey did not seem to be an aggressive or warlike people, although\r\ntheir boundaries were greatly extended, but a thrifty agricultural and\r\nindustrious people. Breeding and marketing horses seem to have been\r\ntheir leading employments. In the twenty-seventh chapter of the Prophet\r\nEzekiel he gives a catalogue of the different peoples trading with the\r\ngreat Phœnician merchants and the products of their countries, in which\r\nthey traded. This catalogue was written five hundred and fifty-eight\r\nyears before the Christian era, and is very remarkable for its extent\r\nand completeness. It not only shows what the Phœnicians carried away\r\nto the West, in their “Ships of Tarshish,” but also what they brought\r\nback for distribution among their customers in Western Asia. I will\r\nquote, from the revised version, two or three of the classes of articles\r\nenumerated, embracing both import and export trade. Of foreign imports\r\nhe says: “Tarshish” (Spain and beyond) “was thy merchant by reason of\r\nthe multitude of all kinds of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead,\r\nthey traded for thy wares.” Of articles for export he says: “They of the\r\nhouse of Togarmah traded for thy wares with horses and war-horses and\r\nmules.” “Togarmah” here means “Armenia,” and this is the only instance\r\nin which horses are mentioned in the catalogue. I will give another\r\nquotation, not because it is conclusive in itself, but because it is\r\nconfirmatory of Strabo’s statement that there were no horses in Arabia\r\nin his day. He says: “Arabia and all the princes of Kedar, they were the\r\nmerchants of thy hand; in lambs, and rams, and goats, in these were they\r\nthy merchants.” Other products from more southern portions of Arabia are\r\nenumerated, but no horses. This is the initial step toward the general\r\ndistribution of horses, by the Phœnician merchants, which will be\r\ndeveloped in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of Media (Vol. II., p. 265), Strabo says: “The country is\r\npeculiarly adapted, as well as Armenia, to the breeding of horses.” Of\r\none district not far from the Caspian he remarks: “Here, it is said,\r\nfifty thousand mares were pastured in the time of the Persians, and\r\nwere the king’s stud. The Nessæan horses, the best and the largest in\r\nthe king’s province, were of this breed, according to some writers, but\r\naccording to others they were from Armenia.” Again he says: “Cappadocia\r\npaid to the Persians, yearly, in addition to a tribute in silver, one\r\nthousand five hundred horses, two thousand mules, and fifty thousand\r\nsheep, and the Medes contributed nearly double this amount.”\r\n\r\nOf Armenia he says, p. 271: “The country is so well adapted, being\r\nnothing inferior in this respect to Media, for breeding horses that the\r\nrace of Nessæan horses, which the king of Persia used, is found here\r\nalso; the satrap of Armenia used to send annually to the king of Persia\r\ntwenty thousand young horses.”\r\n\r\nThe Nessæan horses, so famous for their speed, were the “thoroughbreds”\r\nof their day, and there can hardly be a doubt they originated in Armenia,\r\nand, just like our own “thoroughbreds,” they were essentially the result\r\nof careful selection through a series of generations, and of breeding\r\nonly from animals possessing the desired qualifications in the highest\r\ndegree. In the earlier days of racing in Media, it appears that white\r\nwas the fashionable color, but I am disposed to think that grey, growing\r\nwhite with age, was the color intended to be expressed by the writers\r\nof that period. The “albino” color is abnormal and supposed to indicate\r\ntenderness and lack of stamina.\r\n\r\nThere is one fact, in considering this question, to which I have probably\r\nnot given sufficient prominence and weight. So far as the records go,\r\nthe three countries of Armenia, Cappadocia, and Media are synchronous\r\nin having mounted troops in their armies seventeen hundred years before\r\nthe Christian era. We must, therefore, consider the conditions of these\r\ncountries antecedent to the period of 1700 B.C. Of Cappadocia we know\r\nabsolutely nothing historically until it was conquered by Cyrus, king\r\nof Persia, about 588 B.C. Of Media the earliest knowledge we have of a\r\nhistorical character does not go back further than about 842 B.C. It\r\nshould be observed that I here speak of “historical” knowledge and not\r\nof uncertain traditions of many centuries earlier. Both of these nations\r\nwith their distinctive nationalities have, long since, been wiped off the\r\nsurface of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen we reach Armenia, we reach a people with a most remarkable history,\r\nextending back for more than four thousand years. This history, although\r\nnot wholly free from criticism or doubt, seems to be honestly written and\r\nworthy of a liberal measure of confidence. That the children of Japheth\r\nshould have settled at the foot of the mountains of Ararat strikes every\r\none as a very natural event, but that their descendants should still be\r\nthere, through all the triumphs and oppressions of four thousand years,\r\nis one of the most stupendous facts in the history of the world. From\r\nthe very first we know of them they seem to have been an agricultural\r\npeople, strongly attached to their native soil. When they ruled over the\r\nland from the Caspian to the Mediterranean, they built no great cities,\r\nbut adhered steadfastly to the rural pursuits of their fathers, and\r\nthis, probably, was the chief cause of their weakness. Their wealth\r\nand sources of wealth were chiefly in their horses, and these they sold\r\nto the merchants of Sidon and Tyre, who carried them to all the nations\r\nof Europe and Africa, commencing with Egypt, and supplying all wants as\r\nfar as Spain and Morocco, and beyond, probably, as far as Britain. The\r\nPhœnician merchants were the first to open commercial transactions with\r\nEurope and Africa, and they were in control of the commerce of the world\r\nlong before King Solomon entered into commercial partnership with Hiram,\r\nking of Tyre. Armenia had horses to sell long before they had horses\r\nin Egypt, and Phœnicia had ships and enterprise to carry them there.\r\nThere is a fitting of interests here that seems to point to Armenia as\r\nthe great original source of supply, and as the original habitat of the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEARLY DISTRIBUTION OF HORSES.\r\n\r\n    First evidences of horses in Egypt about 1700 B.C.—Supported\r\n    by Egyptian records and history—The Patriarch Job had no\r\n    horses—Solomon’s great cavalry force organized—Arabia as\r\n    described by Strabo at the beginning of our era—No horses\r\n    then in Arabia—Constantius sends two hundred Cappadocian\r\n    horses into Arabia A.D. 356—Arabia the last country to be\r\n    supplied with horses—The ancient Phœnician merchants and their\r\n    colonies —Hannibal’s cavalry forces in the Punic Wars—Distant\r\n    ramifications of Phœnician trade and colonization—Commerce\r\n    reached as far as Britain and the Baltic—Probable source of\r\n    Britain’s earliest horses.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving considered the different theories or opinions as to the original\r\nhabitat of the horse and the means and facilities by which distribution\r\nto the different portions of the earth may have been effected, I have\r\nomitted land migration, which will be self-evident to all as an important\r\nfactor in the problem. It is now in order, therefore, to consider such\r\ndates and facts as are pertinent and may be gleaned from history, sacred\r\nand profane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHŒNICIAN COLONIES\r\n\r\nABOUT 1200 B.C.]\r\n\r\nWhen Abraham, with Sarah his wife, visited Egypt about 1920 B.C., the\r\nPharaoh for her sake bestowed upon him many gifts: “Sheep and oxen and\r\nhe asses and men servants and maid servants and she asses and camels.”\r\nAmong these great gifts there were no horses, evidently because Egypt\r\nhad no horses at that time. There is no mention nor reference to horses\r\nin Egypt till Joseph became prime minister two hundred years later,\r\nwhen there were a few horses, and they were traded or sold to Joseph by\r\ntheir owners in exchange for food, not in droves, but as individuals.\r\nThese scriptural facts in the experiences of Abraham and Joseph seem\r\nto be circumstantially sustained by the discoveries of those learned\r\nEgyptologists who, in late years and with the spade in their hands,\r\nhave resurrected so much of history that had been buried for thousands\r\nof years. It was during the reign of the Hyksos, or Shepherd Kings,\r\nthat Abraham and Joseph were in Egypt, and in order to approximate the\r\ntime when horses were first introduced, we must glance at a few facts\r\nin connection with what is known of the Hyksos. Some have claimed they\r\nwere from Chaldea, some from Northern Syria and Asia Minor, and some\r\nagain from Phœnicia, and it is one of the strangest things in history\r\nthat a great nation should be overthrown and held in subjection for over\r\nfive hundred years and nobody know who did it. Then again, it is equally\r\nincomprehensible that any nation should have subdued Egypt and held it\r\nin bondage so long and yet never have claimed the honor of having done\r\nso. Still another mystery remains that never has been solved, and that\r\nis, what became of the Shepherds and their followers when they were\r\ndriven out? At the period of the conquest the governing class was rent by\r\nfactions and under a weak and tyrannical king. The Delta and the Valley\r\nof the Nile were crowded with slaves, many of them of Asiatic origin.\r\nThe elevated plains and mountain sides were covered with fierce and\r\nintractable nomads, all of Asiatic origin, tending their flocks. Some\r\nbrave and skillful shepherd organized the shepherds and the slaves and at\r\ntheir head swept down upon the government with a power that was so mighty\r\nas to be irresistible. Manetho, the great Egyptian historian of more\r\nthan two thousand years ago, thus describes the event: “Under this king,\r\nthen, I know not wherefore, the god caused to blow upon us a baleful\r\nwind, and in the face of all probability bands from the East, people of\r\nignoble race, came upon us unawares, attacked the country and subdued it\r\neasily and without fighting.” In remarking upon this same event Professor\r\nMaspero, who stands at the very head of the Egyptologists, says: “It\r\nis possible that they (the shepherds) owed this rapid victory to the\r\npresence in their armies of a factor hitherto unknown to the Africans—the\r\nwar chariot—and before the horse and his driver the Egyptians gave way in\r\na body.” In view of the direct declaration of Manetho that the question\r\nof the succession was settled “without fighting,” the mere suggestion of\r\nan unsustained “possibility” from Maspero that the result may have been\r\ndetermined by the war chariots cannot be accepted. All the authorities\r\nagree that the horse was introduced into Egypt at some period during the\r\nrule of the Shepherd Kings, but there is absolutely no evidence that this\r\nwas at the beginning or anywhere near the beginning of that rule.\r\n\r\nNo records or delineations of the horse have been found in any of the\r\ntemples or tombs of Egypt prior to the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ndynasty, which was probably about the year 1570 B.C. and contemporaneous\r\nwith the birth of Moses. If the Shepherd Kings left behind them any\r\nrecords or delineations of the horse it would be quite natural for the\r\ntrue kingly line to destroy and erase every vestige of whatever would\r\nrevive a memory to them so bitter and hateful. But the absence of all\r\ntraces of horses under the seventeenth dynasty of the Shepherds does not\r\nprove that there was none, for we have direct proof in Joseph’s case that\r\nthey were there one hundred and fifty-six years, and in Jacob’s burial\r\none hundred and nineteen years before the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ndynasty.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the time when they procured their horses having\r\nnow been approximately settled, the inquiry naturally follows as to\r\nwhere they came from? In answering this question there seems to be no\r\nhesitation or doubt. They came from Northern Syria, which embraces not\r\nonly the northeastern coast of the Mediterranean, including Phœnicia,\r\nbut the countries north and east of it trading there, which means the\r\ngreat horse-breeding countries of Armenia and Cappadocia. Being largely\r\nengaged in the Egyptian trade for many centuries, it is probable the\r\nPhœnician merchants were the principal agents in supplying them. In\r\nspeaking of the horse in Egypt, Prof. Maspero says: “The horse when once\r\nintroduced into Egypt soon became fairly adapted to its environment. It\r\nretained both its height and size, keeping the convex forehead—which\r\ngave the head a slightly curved profile—the slender neck, the narrow\r\nhind-quarters, the lean and sinewy legs and the long, flowing tail which\r\nhad characterized it in its native country. The climate, however, was\r\nenervating, and constant care had to be taken, by the introduction of new\r\nblood from Syria, to prevent the breed from deteriorating. The Pharaohs\r\nkept studs of horses in the principal cities of the Nile valley, and the\r\ngreat feudal lords, following their example, vied with each other in the\r\npossession of numerous breeding stables.”\r\n\r\nThere are some facts here that are worthy of special emphasis: (1)\r\nThere were no horses in Egypt till the period of the Shepherd Kings,\r\ni. e., about the time of Joseph. (2) All Egyptologists down to the\r\npresent day agree that the supply of Egyptian horses was procured from\r\nNorthern Syria. (3) The Egyptians and the Arabians were adjoining nations\r\nin constant, friendly intercourse, exchanging the products of their\r\nrespective countries, and yet there is no shadow of an intimation that\r\nthe Arabians had then ever owned a horse. It is reasonable to conclude,\r\ntherefore, not only from what is written, but from what is implied, that\r\nthe Arabians at about the period of 1600 B.C. had no horses. Northern\r\nSyria, as the source of Egyptian supply, points directly to Armenia,\r\nadjoining on the east, as the original source. When Strabo wrote at the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era that there were no horses in Arabia at\r\nthat time, he would still have been within the bounds of the truth if he\r\nhad said there had been none there for more the sixteen hundred years\r\nbefore his day. All these considerations confirm the history that has\r\ncome down to us from Philostorgius.\r\n\r\nAs early as the dynasties of the Shepherd Kings and while the Israelites\r\nwere still in Egyptian bondage, the Phœnician merchants had accumulated\r\ngreat wealth and great power and were literally the masters of the seas.\r\nThe Phœnicians were a commercial and maritime people and the Egyptians\r\nwere, in fact, dependent upon them for all their foreign supplies.\r\nThese conditions leave hardly a doubt that Egypt’s first supply of\r\nhorses came through the Phœnicians. But upon the establishment of the\r\neighteenth dynasty under the old Thebans, the spirit of war and conquest\r\nrevived, and under Thutmosis I. and Thutmosis III., notably, numerous\r\nand successful campaigns were made against Northern Syria and then\r\nextending eastward across the Euphrates into the borders of Armenia and\r\nAssyria. And from the number of horses and chariots captured in battle\r\nand collected as tribute, the careful student cannot avoid the conclusion\r\nthat this kind of spoil was the chief incentive to the various campaigns.\r\n“Besides the usual species,” Maspero informs us, “powerful stallions were\r\nimported from Northern Syria, which were known by the Semitic name of\r\n_Abiri_, the strong.” This is the first mention in history of an improved\r\ntype of horse noted for his strength.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the precise period in which the Patriarch Job\r\nlived, he was the author of the grandest panegyric on the war-horse that\r\never was written. Yet it seems strange that he owned seven thousand\r\nsheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred\r\nshe asses, but did not own a horse. To draw his picture of the war-horse\r\nhe must have seen him in action, on the field, and it is not improbable\r\nin his younger days he witnessed, or possibly participated in, some great\r\nbattle between the Babylonians and the Persians, north of the latitude\r\nand country in which he lived. It is now generally conceded, I think,\r\namong learned men that the “land of Uz” was in the southeastern portion\r\nof Arabia Deserta, bordering on the Persian Gulf, where the horse is a\r\nuseless luxury. Job was a very rich man, he certainly did not lack in\r\nadmiration of the horse, and if he had thought that horses would add to\r\nhis comfort and enjoyment he could easily have obtained them from the\r\ngreat herds in the north. But the camel is the great beast of service\r\nand utility in Arabia; it was so in Job’s time, it is so to-day, and it\r\nalways will be so because it is suited to the environment.\r\n\r\nWhen Joshua was subduing the tribes of Canaan, B.C. 1450, he found that\r\nthe Phœnicians had several well-fortified cities and did not attack them,\r\nbut he encountered a combination of “Northern Kings” with a vast army and\r\n“with horses and chariots very many.” His victory was complete, and he\r\nhoughed their horses and burned their chariots with fire.\r\n\r\nJabin, called the King of Canaan, in the time of the Judges, had his\r\nkingdom on the northern border of Palestine and east of Phœnicia, at\r\nthe southern extension of Mount Lebanon. Sisera, one of the greatest\r\ncommanders of the time, B.C. 1285, commanded his army and he had nine\r\nhundred chariots of iron, but the victory of the Israelites was complete.\r\n\r\nIn the year B.C. 1056, David pursued some of the tribes of Western Arabia\r\nthat had made a raid on Southern Palestine and carried away many captives\r\nand much spoil. He overtook them with his own followers and subdued them,\r\nand none escaped except four hundred young men who fled on camels. He\r\nrecovered all the captives and brought back all the flocks and herds,\r\nbut there were no horses among them. About the same time, historians\r\ninform us, the tribes of Eastern Arabia were paying their tribute to the\r\nAssyrians in camels and asses, while the northern countries were paying\r\ntheirs in horses and money.\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Sheba visited King Solomon B.C. 992, to learn of his wisdom\r\nand “to prove him with hard questions.” Her kingdom was in that part\r\nof southeastern Arabia now called Yemen, bordering on the Red Sea. Her\r\njourney was a very long one and she “came with a very great train of\r\ncamels that bare spices and very much gold and precious stones.” It will\r\nbe observed that there were no horses in this “very great train.” It will\r\nbe observed further, from the incidents above related, that whenever the\r\nIsraelites met their neighbors north of them, whether in peace or war,\r\nthey met horses with them; and whenever they met their neighbors south\r\nof them, they were mounted only on camels.\r\n\r\nWhen the dominions of Solomon had become vastly extended, embracing\r\nnumbers of tributary kingdoms, as well as nomadic tribes, and when his\r\nships had gathered in untold riches from all parts of the world, he\r\nfound it prudent to reorganize his army for the defense of his kingdom\r\nand his wealth, and on a scale commensurate with the dangers that might\r\narise from a combination of the jealous and envious neighbors with whom\r\nhe was surrounded. Among the northern kingdoms of that day it had been\r\noften demonstrated in battle that the effective force of an army must\r\nbe estimated by its strength in horsemen and chariots of war. Solomon,\r\ntherefore, bought horses and chariots from Egypt, and horses from all\r\nlands that had them for sale. It is probable that the superiority of\r\nthe Egyptian chariots was the special reason for buying them in that\r\ncountry, as he paid six hundred shekels of silver for the chariots and\r\none hundred and fifty for the horses to bring them home. The reorganized\r\narmy consisted of one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand\r\nhorsemen, and they were quartered in the different large cities in his\r\ndominions. In the interval of seven hundred and twenty-eight years that\r\nhad elapsed since Joseph was Prime Minister, and horses introduced in\r\nEgypt, they had greatly multiplied. When Solomon died and his kingdom was\r\ndivided into two hostile camps, Hiram, King of Tyre, his lifelong friend\r\nand associate, became virtually his successor to the trade of the world.\r\n\r\nThe great Greek geographer, Strabo, traveled and wrote in the reign of\r\nAugustus, and died A.D. 24. For descriptions of all countries of that\r\nperiod and their industries and productions, he has been quoted for\r\neighteen hundred years as the best if not the only authority. Writing\r\nas he did, at the very initial point of the Christian era, he gives us\r\na landmark that fixes itself in the mind. He gives a brief, but quite\r\nsatisfactory, description of Arabia, in which he notes the general\r\ntopography and boundaries as they are understood to-day; and then he\r\nenters, somewhat, into the climate, productions of the soil, character\r\nand industries of the people, etc. Of one part of the country he speaks\r\nof the inhabitants as breeders of camels, and of another, that is more\r\nproductive, he remarks: “The general fertility of the country is very\r\ngreat; among other products there is in particular an abundant supply\r\nof honey. Except horses, there are numerous herds of animals, asses\r\nand swine, birds also of every kind, except geese and the gallinaceous\r\ntribes.”\r\n\r\nHere we have from the very highest authority the pivotal fact that there\r\nwere no horses in Arabia at the commencement of the Christian era. This\r\ndoes not rest upon argument, nor is it a deduction from some condition\r\nof things that might have existed; but it is a distinct declaration of\r\nwhat Strabo saw with his own eyes and wrote down when he saw it. It must,\r\ntherefore, stand as an undisputed fact, until some reputable authority is\r\nbrought forward to contradict it. This description from Strabo applies\r\nto that rich portion of Arabia, bordering on the Red Sea along its full\r\nlength. With the fact established, circumstantially and historically,\r\nthat there were no horses in Arabia at the beginning of the Christian\r\nera, it now remains to consider how and when they were first introduced\r\nin that country.\r\n\r\nPhilostorgius, a distinguished Greek theologian, born A.D. 425, as\r\nrelated in the preceding chapter, wrote an ecclesiastical history, which\r\nis no longer extant, but fortunately Photius, at one time patriarch\r\nof the Eastern church, born A.D. 853, prepared an epitome of it. This\r\nepitome of Philostorgius comes down to A.D. 425, and is to be found\r\nin the Lenox Library of this city, bound up in the same volume with\r\nSozomen’s Ecclesiastical History. I will here quote literally from this\r\nepitome so much as is pertinent to the question before us. Constantius\r\nwas then on the throne of the Eastern Empire, and labored for the\r\npromotion of the Christian religion.\r\n\r\n    “Constantius sent ambassadors to those who were formerly called\r\n    Sabæans, but are now known as Homeritæ, a tribe descended from\r\n    Abraham, by Keturah. As to the territory which they inhabit,\r\n    it is called by the Greeks Magna Arabia and Arabia Felix, and\r\n    extends to the most distant part of the ocean. Its metropolis\r\n    is Saba, the city from which the Queen of Sheba went forth to\r\n    see Solomon.... Constantius, accordingly, sent ambassadors to\r\n    them to come over to the Christian religion.... Constantius,\r\n    wishing to array the embassy with peculiar splendor, put on\r\n    board their ships two hundred well-bred horses from Cappadocia,\r\n    and sent them, with many other gifts.... The embassy turned\r\n    out successfully, for the prince of the nation, by sincere\r\n    conviction, came over to the true religion.”\r\n\r\nOther facts might be quoted from this epitome, showing that Theopholis\r\nwas made a bishop and placed at the head of this embassy and that\r\nhe remained in Arabia Felix several years, prosecuting his work\r\nsuccessfully. It might also be quoted to show that the people of the\r\ncities of Yemen (Arabia Felix) were, at that day, well advanced in\r\ncivilization and refinement, and that wealth and luxury abounded on\r\nall sides. Their lands, from the sea to the desert, were wonderfully\r\nproductive, and their people lived in the cities and on their farms,\r\nbut few leading a nomadic life. In later generations this part of the\r\ncountry, which is in Arabia Felix, has been called Yemen, and I believe\r\nit is universally conceded among the Arab tribes and by writers who have\r\nstudied the subject that the best horses come from Yemen.\r\n\r\nTaking the administration of Joseph as indicating the time when the first\r\nhorses were introduced into Egypt, about B.C. 1720, and the actual date\r\nwhen Constantius sent the first into Arabia, A.D. 356, we find that Egypt\r\nled Arabia by two thousand and seventy-six years. And yet numbers of men\r\nhave written great pretentious books on the horse, in which they tell\r\nus that the Egyptians got their horses from the Arabians; while others\r\nequally pretentious and voluminous tell us the Arabians got their horses\r\nfrom the Egyptians; and neither class probably ever gave the labor of an\r\nhonest hour to settle this question. The one is over two thousand years\r\nout of the way, and still they know just as much about it as the other\r\nknows. They are both equally ignorant and equally dishonest, for they\r\nsimply copied, as their own, what somebody had said before them.\r\n\r\nIt is conceded on all hands and by all men who have gone beneath the mere\r\nsurface, that the literature of the ages furnishes no evidence that there\r\nwere horses in Arabia before the fourth or fifth century of our era.\r\nGeneral Tweedie, by far the ablest writer on the Arabian horse that we\r\nhave examined, concedes the pertinency and force of the absence of all\r\nliterary evidence, until the fifth century is reached, and as a reply he\r\nsays: “The several Roman invasions of Arabia, in the reigns of Augustus,\r\nTrajan, and Severus, must have left foreign horses behind them.” This\r\nis, in fact, conceding the accuracy of Strabo’s representations and that\r\nthere were no horses in Arabia at the beginning of the Christian era. The\r\ntruth of the historical allusion is that the Romans never overran nor\r\nconquered Arabia. They could skirmish around the border and capture a\r\nfew towns or cities, but the death-dealing desert was too much for them.\r\nTrajan at last made it a Roman province by his proclamation, and not by\r\nhis sword, and for the excellent reason that “the game was not worth the\r\ncandle.” What a strange fact it is that Arabia, instead of the first,\r\nshould have been the last country in all the old world to be supplied\r\nwith horses!\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to comprehend or even imagine the changes that may\r\nbe wrought in a thousand years by a strong, enterprising, and aggressive\r\npeople, colonized in a rich country occupied by semi-barbarians and\r\nsavages. This was the condition in Northern Africa, when the Phœnician\r\ncolonies were planted there, a thousand years before the Christian era.\r\nThe colony at Utica in Algeria was planted about eleven hundred years\r\nbefore the Christian era, which was contemporaneous with the reign of\r\nSaul as king of Israel. The colony of Carthage, that afterward contested\r\nwith Rome for universal dominion, was planted in the same country, about\r\ntwo hundred years later, and was contemporaneous with Jehu. The whole\r\nsouthern shore of the Mediterranean was dotted with Phœnician colonies,\r\nfrom Egypt westward.\r\n\r\nThe oldest of the Phœnician colonies so far from home was probably Gades,\r\nnow called Cadiz, on the Atlantic coast of Spain and outside of the\r\nPillars of Hercules. This colony was planted about fifteen hundred years\r\nB.C. and was contemporaneous with Moses and the forty years’ journeying\r\nof the Israelites in the wilderness. The more recent scholarship seems\r\nto have developed the fact that still north of Gades and extending from\r\nthe mouth of the Guadelete to that of the Guadiana, there was a very\r\nlarge and flourishing colony planted by the Phœnicians, possessing within\r\nitself many of the requisites and functions of statehood, and that\r\nthis was the ancient “Tarshish” of scripture. This plantation became a\r\nsecondary Tyre, and the “ships of Tarshish” not only made their voyages\r\nback and forth through the length of the Mediterranean, but extended them\r\nnorthward, up the European coast and to Britain, and southward along the\r\nAfrican coast for a great distance, establishing trading posts wherever\r\nthe products of a country promised profitable exchange.\r\n\r\nThe planting of colonies in that age, even for the one ostensible purpose\r\nof trade, involved more than the mere erection of a “trading post”\r\nat some selected harbor. A strong and well-equipped and well-trained\r\nmilitary force had to be employed to protect and defend them. The\r\nPhœnicians were great traders, and at the same time they were excellent\r\nfighters. Their numerous colonies on both shores of the Mediterranean\r\nrequired a strong military force that was made up very largely of\r\nslaves and the nomadic tribes of the country, but always commanded by\r\nprominent and influential Phœnicians. It is impossible to tell what the\r\nvery early experiences of the colonists may have been with regard to\r\nhorses; nor do we know whether they found horses already there when they\r\narrived at their new plantations. My belief is, however, that they were\r\nnot only the first to carry horses to Egypt, but they were the first\r\nto carry them to the western extremities of the Mediterranean. It will\r\nbe remembered that the early trade of the Armenians with the Phœnician\r\nmerchants was not only in horses, but in _horsemen_, and it is probable\r\nthat these “horsemen” were slaves, expert and skillful in managing the\r\nhorse. It has been said by historians that certain classes of their ships\r\nwere ornamented with a carved horse’s head, at the prow; and it has been\r\ninferred that the ships so designated were specially constructed and\r\nfitted up for the safe carrying of horses. It is true that in the course\r\nof the centuries horses may have found their way from Egypt westward to\r\nAlgeria, and by crossing the Bosphorus they might have found their way\r\nfrom Asia Minor to Spain, but it is also true that from small beginnings\r\nat the plantation of the colonies there was ample time for them to\r\nincrease to almost countless herds before the period when the colonists\r\nbecame a mighty military power in the earth.\r\n\r\nHistorians tell us that the military establishment of the city of\r\nCarthage alone, when on a peace footing, consisted of three hundred\r\nelephants, four thousand horses and forty thousand foot soldiers.\r\nWhen Hannibal started out to fight Rome, in the second Punic war, say\r\nB.C. 218, he had with him eighty thousand footmen and twelve thousand\r\nhorsemen; and he left thirty-two thousand soldiers at home to guard his\r\nSpanish and his African dominions. With a proportional division of the\r\nhome troops, he then had about seventeen thousand mounted men in his\r\narmy. These were not war levies, but hardened and trained soldiers, and\r\nit is, therefore, not remarkable that he held nearly the whole of Spain\r\nin subjection, and practically all of Northwestern Africa. Polybius,\r\nthe soldier historian, tells us that “his Numidian cavalry formed the\r\nstrongest part of his army, and to their quick evolutions, their sudden\r\nretreat, and their rapid return to the charge, may be attributed the\r\nsuccess of Hannibal in his great victories.” At an earlier period, we\r\nlearn that in the organization of the Phœnician armies the numerous\r\nnomadic tribes were placed on their flanks, and wheeled about on\r\nunsaddled horses guided by a bridle of rushes.\r\n\r\nAt a very remote period there were two tribes in the interior of Spain,\r\nthe Celtæ and Iberi, that were greatly distinguished for their love of\r\nindependence and their bravery in defending it. The antiquarians have\r\nfailed to give us any information as to what they were or whence they\r\ncame. They were contemporaneous with some of the early colonies of the\r\nPhœnicians. Their tactics in battle seemed to have been to break the\r\nenemy’s ranks by a charge as cavalry, and to then dismount and fight on\r\nfoot. They united as one people and called themselves Celtiberi. Where\r\nthey got their horses, or whether they had them before the Phœnicians\r\narrived, are questions that cannot be answered.\r\n\r\nThe Visigoths, or western Goths, overran Northern Italy, settled in\r\nSouthern France and eventually passed over into Spain, where they\r\nestablished a dynasty that lasted over two centuries and until it\r\nwas overthrown by the Saracens, A.D. 711. Roderick, the king of the\r\nVisigoths, went out to battle with the Saracens, arrayed in his most\r\nshowy apparel, and mounted on his splendid chariot, made of ivory and\r\nset with precious stones. As the battle progressed he saw what he had\r\ngood reason to believe was treachery on the part of one wing of his army\r\nand he alighted from his chariot, mounted his horse called Orelia and\r\nrode away while his soldiers were being butchered. He was the last of\r\nthe Gothic dynasty. There had been a battle between the navies of the\r\nSaracens and the Goths, A.D. 680, fifty-one years earlier, in which the\r\nfleet of the Saracens had been entirely destroyed, and at that time the\r\nSaracens occupied the whole of the southern shore of the Mediterranean.\r\nThe word “Moors,” as often used to designate the people of Northern\r\nAfrica, is not well chosen, for it really belongs to but one of many\r\ndifferent tribes of different names. The term “Saracen” anciently meant\r\nonly an Arab born, but since the middle ages it has come to mean any\r\nand all adherents to the Mohammedan religion, in the usage of Christian\r\npeople, and is particularly apposite when speaking of a number of tribes\r\nengaged in a common cause.\r\n\r\nThe people of Northern Africa were not negroes as we understand the word,\r\nbut a mixture of different races. When the Phœnicians settled among\r\nthem they were nomadic barbarians, possessing a country of great riches\r\nwithout knowing it. Under the tuition of their new masters they made\r\ngreat advances in many of the arts of peace and in all the arts of war.\r\nThe Phœnician blood was liberally commingled with that of the natives.\r\nThe blood carried the brains, and hence the beautiful structures that\r\ncame from their hands and heads. No purely bred nomad ever could have\r\nconceived or constructed the Alhambra. The Phœnicians were refined and\r\neducated idolaters, as refinement and education were understood in their\r\nday, while the native people were literally barbarians.\r\n\r\nThe then recent and rapid spread of Mohammedanism among all the people\r\nof Northern Africa is, on its surface, one of the most remarkable facts\r\nin history. As a religion it served to unite, under the banner of the\r\nCrescent, all who accepted it, and guaranteed to all who fell in its\r\ndefense immediate admission to paradise. All who did not accept it were\r\nenemies and only fit to perish by the sword of the Saracen. The founder\r\nof this religion died A.D. 632, and seventy-nine years afterward his\r\nfollowers, in Northern Africa alone, won their great victory over the\r\nGothic dynasty of Spain. When once on Spanish soil they appeared to take\r\nroot there and held possession of a large part of Spain for nearly nine\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\nNow that I have traversed the field of Spain and Northern Africa, from\r\nthe first dawnings of history down to the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, in order to gather in all that history reveals touching the\r\nintroduction and propagation of the horse in those regions, we are\r\nready to summarize the facts that we have gleaned. At the periods of\r\nsix hundred (when Carthage became independent of the mother country),\r\nfour hundred, and two hundred years before the Christian era, there is\r\nundoubted evidence, over and over again, that Spain and Northern Africa\r\nwere abundantly supplied with horses. Then, how is it possible that the\r\nhordes of Barbarians from Asia could have supplied these countries with\r\nhorses, when they did not arrive there until several centuries after\r\nthe supply is established to have existed? Take, if you please, the\r\nshortest of the periods suggested above, when Hannibal’s cavalry almost\r\nannihilated a great Roman army, two hundred and sixteen years before\r\nthe Christian era. This was five hundred and seventy-two years before\r\nArabia had any horses; and how can “the blind leaders of the blind”\r\nsupply Hannibal’s cavalry with Arabian blood? When the people of Northern\r\nAfrica, west of Egypt, fought their way into Spain it is not known that\r\nthere was a single Arabian soldier nor a single Arabian horse in the\r\nwhole army. They were all called Arabians, however, and that pretense has\r\nexisted ever since.\r\n\r\nThe Phœnicians were the most remarkable people of all the early ages\r\nand indeed of any age. They belonged to the Aramaic or Semitic race;\r\nthey settled in Canaan long before the days of Abraham and attained\r\ntheir greatest prosperity in the days of Solomon, when his fleets and\r\nthose of his friend Hiram, King of Tyre, controlled and monopolized the\r\ncommerce of the world. More than five hundred years before this alliance,\r\nhowever, they had established commercial relations with all the countries\r\nbordering on the Mediterranean, and their ships were trading in the ports\r\nof every country from Egypt to the Pillars of Hercules and far beyond.\r\nThere seems to be no doubt that they carried tin from Britain and amber\r\nfrom the Baltic, and, of course, they had to bring something to exchange\r\nfor what they carried away. What did they bring? As amber did not enter\r\ninto the necessary arts it is not probable the trade was very large, but\r\ntin was required by many nations in their everyday life, especially the\r\nEgyptians, who had no foreign commerce and were thus dependent upon the\r\nPhœnician merchants. We may conclude, therefore, that the trade in tin\r\nwas large, and as there was no Phœnician colony in extreme southwestern\r\nBritain, the foreign traders would bring just what the Britons most\r\nneeded. If they were already in possession of horses they would not need\r\nthat kind of exchange, but if they were not in possession of horses,\r\nthat would be just the kind of exchange they would want, and probably\r\nthis was the source from which they obtained their supply. The question,\r\nhowever, of how or when our British ancestors obtained their first supply\r\nof horses has never been positively answered. That they had them in great\r\nabundance at the beginning of the Christian era is fully established by\r\nthe experience of the Romans when they captured Britain. From their great\r\nnumbers and the skill displayed in their management in battle, it cannot\r\nbe doubted that they were there for many generations before the Roman\r\narmies came in contact with them. Many theories have been advanced as to\r\nhow the horse may have reached Britain, but no one of them rests on so\r\nreasonable a basis of probability as that of the Phœnician traders. If\r\nfrom this source, which I am strongly disposed to believe was the true\r\nsource, it must have been during the maritime supremacy of the Phœnicians\r\nand their colonies, and this would place the date several centuries\r\nbefore the Christian era. If we were able to reconstruct the original\r\nline of the migration of the early English horses, we would, probably,\r\nfirst find them in “the land of Togarmah” starting to market at Tyre,\r\nwhere they were exchanged for supplies needed in Armenia. There they were\r\nput on board one of the great “ships of Tarshish,” and when they next\r\ntouched the land it was at one of the ports at the southwestern portion\r\nof England, where they were exchanged for tin and other products of the\r\nmines.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the argument furnished by this known course of trade\r\nbetween nations and peoples, in prehistoric times, we have an additional\r\none in the natural perpetuation of racial qualities, extending through\r\nmany centuries. In reply to some questions submitted to a friend of\r\nmine who was born in Western Persia, educated in this country, and then\r\nreturned to the land of his nativity, I have replies to my questions\r\nbearing date of July, 1896. He is located at Oroomiah, not far from the\r\nmodern line between Persia and Turkey, and in what may be considered the\r\nvery center of ancient Armenia. He is not skilled in horse lore, but he\r\nuses horses a great deal and is a very intelligent observer. He says\r\nthat the Persian horses have been greatly overrated and that the country\r\nis full of very ordinary horses. He says that they are all colors, with\r\nbays probably predominating. There is a great variety of mixed greys,\r\nshading into white, and a few that are dappled. Then there are chestnuts,\r\nsorrels, “mouse-color” (duns), and not many blacks. They are small, as a\r\nrule, and a harness of small size from this country has to be cut down\r\nfor them. From this I infer that they are generally under fourteen hands.\r\nOn the whole the horses are nicely shaped, have slender, clean limbs,\r\nsmall ears, and carry the head and tail well up. As a rule they are great\r\nstumblers. With regard to gaits he says that stress is laid on a rapid\r\nwalk—a half walk and half trot. In this country we would call it the\r\n“running walk” that may be kept up for days in succession. In speaking of\r\nthe pace, my correspondent says: “There are some horses trained to pace,\r\nwhile some pick it up naturally, that is, are born pacers. The greater\r\nnumber are natural pacers. Now and then one will find a rapid pacer, but\r\ncommonly the pace is a five or six miles an hour gait. There are some\r\nthat single-foot naturally, and from birth.”\r\n\r\nHe then says horses are not bred with any care. They are turned loose in\r\nherds and the breeding is such as would naturally occur.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that my Persian friend speaks of the different\r\ncolors “of grey, shading into white,” which suggests a possible descent\r\nfrom the famous breed of white Nissæan horses kept by the great Darius\r\nand other Medo-Persian monarchs for racing purposes. But the striking\r\nfeature in this description of the horses of Persia, or more properly,\r\nof ancient Armenia, of this day, is the fact that they are of the same\r\nsize and color and habits of action as the horses of Britain when\r\nfirst visited by the Romans, as well as when they were more minutely\r\ndescribed twelve hundred years later, and as they were at the beginning\r\nof the seventeenth century, and as they still were at the middle of the\r\neighteenth century. As evidence on these points reference is made to\r\nthe chapters on horses of the colonial period that will follow in their\r\nplace. In ancient Armenia, as with all pastoral people of the early ages,\r\nhorses were turned out to run in herds and literally left to Mr. Darwin’s\r\nlaw of “natural selection and the survival of the fittest.” So it was in\r\nBritain to a great extent, until the eighteenth century, and so it was in\r\nthe American colonies until fifty years later; hence the same types and\r\ncharacteristics prevailed and were perpetuated in all these countries.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to contemplate the present debased and semi-barbarous condition\r\nof the descendants of a great people who for centuries stood first among\r\nall the nations of the earth in commercial enterprise, in learning, and\r\nin the arts. The banishment of the Saracens from Spain in the beginning\r\nof the seventeenth century of our era was in fact the banishment of\r\nthe descendants of the Phœnicians who first colonized Spain. The\r\narchitectural structures which they left behind them, and which for\r\ntheir marvelous beauty have challenged the admiration of the world, were\r\nnot the work of nomads and barbarians. They were the flashes of the old\r\nPhœnician taste and genius as exemplified by the descendants of the men\r\nwhom Hiram sent to construct and decorate the buildings of Solomon. The\r\nAlhambra and some other structures in Spain are all that we have to\r\nremind us of the genius, and grandeur of Phœnicia. Whatever may have been\r\nthe character and attainments of the descendants of the colonists at\r\nthe time, the change from idolatry to Islamism was a bad one. Wherever,\r\nthroughout the world, the teachings of the “Prophet” have been accepted,\r\nwhole nations have become intolerant, murderous and brutalized, and the\r\nmodern Phœnicians are no exception. They have now lost their identity in\r\nthe follies and crimes of Islamism and we can have no sympathy for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE ARABIAN HORSE.\r\n\r\n    The Arabian, the horse of romance—The horse naturally\r\n    foreign to Arabia— Superiority of the camel for all Arabian\r\n    needs—Scarcity of horses in Arabia in Mohammed’s time—Various\r\n    preposterous traditions of Arab horsemanship—The Prophet’s\r\n    mythical mares—Mohammed not in any sense a horseman—Early\r\n    English Arabians—the Markham Arabian—The alleged Royal\r\n    Mares—The Darley Arabian—The Godolphin Arabian—The Prince\r\n    of Wales’ Arabian race horses—Mr. Blunt’s pilgrimage to the\r\n    Euphrates—His purchases of so-called Arabians—Deyr as a great\r\n    horse market where everything is thoroughbred—Failure of\r\n    Mr. Blunt’s experiments—Various Arabian horses brought to\r\n    America—Horses sent to our Presidents—Disastrous experiments of\r\n    A. Keene Richards—Tendency of Arab romancing from Ben Hur.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmiration always leads to exaggeration. This is true in most of the\r\nrelations of life, but in our admiration of the horse it becomes greatly\r\nintensified, so greatly indeed that in magnifying his excellent qualities\r\nwe find ourselves telling downright falsehoods about him before we know\r\nit. This “amiable weakness,” as we might call it, is true of our everyday\r\nlife and our everyday horses; but when we come to the horse that is the\r\nuniversal ideal of perfection, everybody seems to lay aside all the\r\nrestraints of truth in extolling the superiority of his qualities. The\r\n“Arabian horse” is the ideal horse of all the world. He is the “gold\r\nstandard” in all horsedom, with the one important distinction that the\r\none is real and the other is mythical. Not one so-called horseman in a\r\nmillion ever saw a genuine Arabian horse, nor any of the descendants of\r\none; and in all the discussions of the past three hundred and fifty years\r\nit has never been shown in a single instance that a horse from Arabia,\r\nwith an authenticated pedigree and tracing as such, has ever been of any\r\nvalue, either as a race horse or as a progenitor of race horses. The\r\nsuperior qualities of “the Arabian horse,” like the superior qualities of\r\n“The Arabian Nights,” are purely works of the imagination. There is just\r\nas much truth in the stories of Sindbad the Sailor and Aladdin’s Lamp as\r\nthere is in most of the literature relating to the Arabian horse.\r\n\r\nI am fully satisfied that these views of the Arabian horse will not meet\r\nwith a ready acceptance by the vast majority of the horsemen of this\r\nor any other country, but my reasons for presenting them will become\r\napparent as the discussion progresses. They smash too many idols and\r\ndispel too many chimeras of the brain to be readily accepted. It takes\r\nthe average man a long time to get clear of the prejudices in which he\r\nwas born, and the first question that will be asked by the doubter is,\r\n“Why could not Arabia have supported a race of indigenous wild horses, as\r\nwell as any other country?” Because the horse, wild or tame, has never\r\nlearned to dig a well forty feet deep, nor to draw water after it is\r\ndug. Neither has he learned to lay up a store in time of plenty against\r\na time of famine. The horse could not live in Arabia without the care of\r\nman. And, second, “Why were all the civilized and semi-civilized nations\r\nwest of Asia supplied with horses a thousand years before Arabia, when\r\nso near the original habitat of the horse?” It is the first law of our\r\nnature to supply ourselves with what we need. The camel always has been\r\na necessity to the Arab, not only to carry him and his burdens, but to\r\nfurnish nourishment and sustenance to him and his family. The camel is\r\nadapted to the country and the country to the camel, and no other created\r\nanimal can fill that place. He is, literally, “the ship of the desert.”\r\nThe horse in Arabia is a luxury that can be indulged in only by the rich;\r\nhence his ownership is practically restricted to the chiefs of tribes. He\r\nis never used except for display and war. Palgrave, in speaking specially\r\nof the Nejd tribe, says: “A horse is by no means an article of everyday\r\npossession, or of ordinary or working use. No genuine Arab would ever\r\ndream of mounting his horse for a mere peaceful journey, whether for a\r\nshort or a long distance.”\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the immeasurable superiority of the camel to the\r\nhorse in meeting the wants and necessities of the Arab, we will not be\r\nsurprised at the immense herds of the former and the small numbers of\r\nthe latter that are bred and reared in that country. A camel can go four\r\ndays without water, and under stress, it is said, a good one can cover\r\nthe distance of two hundred miles in twenty-four hours. The camel and\r\nthe country are suited to each other, while the horse is an exotic, and\r\nhas no part in any industrial interest except raiding and robbery. My\r\nattention was first called to this unexpected smallness in the numbers\r\nof Arabian horses in the seventh century, two hundred and sixty years\r\nafter the introduction of the original stock from Cappadocia. The flight\r\nof Mohammed from his enemies in Mecca to Medina took place A.D. 622.\r\nThere, setting up as a Prophet, and as holding communications with\r\nHeaven, he soon gathered around him a number who believed in his divine\r\ninspiration. Understanding the habits and instincts of his followers,\r\nhe soon found he must give them something to do. He called them about\r\nhim, mounted a camel, and at their head he was successful in plundering\r\ntwo or three caravans, which greatly enraged his old enemies at Mecca.\r\nWhether the anger of his enemies was kindled anew because some of the\r\nplunder belonged in Mecca, or whether he merely deprived the Meccans of\r\nthe opportunity of doing the plundering themselves, the historian fails\r\nto make clear. Whichever may have been the underlying reason, it led to\r\nwar. In the first campaign of the Meccans and in the first battle fought,\r\nthey far outnumbered the followers of the Prophet. There were some camels\r\nin Mohammed’s train, but no horses. He did not lead the battle himself,\r\nbut remained in his tent and promised his followers that all who fell\r\nin battle would be forthwith admitted into Paradise. They believed the\r\npromise, as millions and millions have believed it since; it inspired\r\nthem with a recklessness of life, and they were completely victorious.\r\nThe result of this victory was the capture of one hundred and fifteen\r\ncamels and fourteen horses, besides the entire camp of the enemy. In the\r\nbattle of the next year (A.D. 625) between the same parties, the forces\r\nwere much increased on both sides. Sir William Muir, the historian,\r\ninforms us that Mohammed had but two horses in his army, one of which\r\nhe mounted himself and took command of his forces. This battle was not\r\ndecisive. In subsequent raids he captured many enemies and traded his\r\nfemale captives for horses with the surrounding tribes, so far as he was\r\nable to obtain them. The next year he had an army of three thousand men\r\nand thirty-six horses, while the enemy had an army of three thousand men,\r\nof whom two hundred were cavalry, but there was no fighting. The fame of\r\nMohammed as a successful and relentless pillager and destroyer had now\r\nspread far and wide, and as a means of escape the chiefs of the larger\r\nportion of the tribes of Arabia hastened to tender their allegiance\r\nand obey his commands. From this forward, therefore, we must consider\r\nMohammed as the representative of the whole of Arabia, in both its\r\nreligious and military power. The next year his old enemies, the citizens\r\nof Mecca, surrendered the sacred city to him without a blow, and thus\r\nIslamism became a mighty power in the world.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from many sources other than the history of Mohammed that\r\nhorses have always been a very sparse production in Arabia. Burckhardt,\r\nthe famous traveler in the East, journeyed very extensively in Arabia\r\nabout 1814, and he gives the result of his observations on this point of\r\nnumbers as follows: “In all the journey from Mecca to Medina, between\r\nthe mountains and the sea, a distance of at least two hundred and sixty\r\nmiles, I do not believe that two hundred horses could be found, and the\r\nsame proportion of numbers may be remarked all along the Red Sea.” This\r\nis in strict conformity with the observations of other writers, the\r\nreasons for which have already been given.\r\n\r\nTime out of mind, everybody has heard of the insuperable difficulty of\r\nprevailing upon an Arab to part with his genuine, high-caste mare for\r\neither love or money. He will expatiate, as the story goes, upon “the\r\nbeauty and graces of his mare as the light of his household and the joy\r\nand playmate of his children, and above all as she is royally bred he\r\ncannot, as a good Moslem, disobey the injunctions of the Prophet not to\r\nsell such mares, but to keep them forever that their descendants may\r\nenrich the children of the faithful to all generations.” If you ask him\r\nmore particularly about her lines of descent, he will give you fifty or\r\na hundred generations and land you safely on the name of the particular\r\none of the five mares of the Prophet from which she is descended. To\r\nillustrate the sham of all this Major Upton’s experience, in purchasing\r\nhorses in Arabia for the East India service, may be cited. It is evident\r\nthe major understands his dealers and they understand him. He says: “In\r\nthe desert we never heard of Mohammed’s mares, nor was his name ever\r\nmentioned in any way as connected with the Arabian horse.” He says there\r\nis no restriction nor difficulty in buying as many mares as you want, in\r\nany part of Arabia. This disposes of the tricky pretenses of the Arab\r\nhorse dealer when he is negotiating a sale to a man without Arabian\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nSome modern writers make mention of a tradition that still prevails\r\namong some tribes as to the origin of the Arabian horse, and it is to\r\nthe effect that their best horses came originally from Yemen. This\r\ntradition is met with in Arabia Deserta, a long way from Arabia Felix, of\r\nwhich Yemen is a portion. While this tradition is of no possible value\r\nas evidence, it is suggestive of what might be unearthed in that strange\r\ncountry. The people were not nomadic, but agricultural and commercial,\r\nand the cities were rich. The people were well advanced in the arts and\r\ncomforts of civilized life, and in their cities they had many beautiful\r\ntemples and palaces. Such a people would of necessity produce learned\r\nmen who would leave records of their national history behind them, and\r\nespecially that of such an event as the conversion of the whole people\r\nto Christianity. Possibly the researches of scholarly men may yet bring\r\nto light more of the facts connected with the embassy from the Emperor\r\nConstantius and the introduction of the Cappadocian horses into Yemen, as\r\nrelated in the preceding chapters.\r\n\r\nThere are many other traditions, so called, that are burnished up and\r\nbrought out whenever the crafty dealer finds he has a Richards from\r\nAmerica, or a Blunt from England, with his mind already made up that all\r\nthe best horses of the world have come from Arabia. To such a customer,\r\nwith his mind already at high tension in search for the longest pedigree\r\nand the purest blood, the dealer casts his hook in something like the\r\nform following:\r\n\r\n“When King Solomon had completed the temple he turned his attention to\r\nsupplying his army with horses and chariots. He searched every nation\r\nthat had horses for sale and would have none but the very best that the\r\nworld could produce. He spent much of his time in admiring his beautiful\r\nhorses, and one day he was so thoroughly absorbed that the hour of prayer\r\npassed without his observing it. He felt that this neglect to pray at the\r\nproper time was a great sin, and that his horses had led him into it.\r\nHe did not hesitate longer, but he at once ordered all his horses to be\r\nturned loose to the public. Some of my ancestors succeeded in securing\r\nsix of these mares, and from these six mares all the good horses of\r\nArabia are descended.”\r\n\r\nOther dealers are a little more modest in their claims for the antiquity\r\nof the pedigrees of their horses, and generously knock off about sixteen\r\nhundred years, being content to trace to the mares of the Prophet\r\ninstead of the mares of Solomon. This still leaves them with a pedigree\r\nonly about twelve hundred years long, which beats our modern romancers\r\nin making stud books. In order to test and select the mares that were\r\nworthy of becoming the dams of the best horses, as the story goes, the\r\nProphet shut up a herd of mares, in plain sight of water, and kept them\r\nthere till they were almost famished with thirst; and then at a signal\r\nthey were all released at once, and when rushing headlong to the water\r\nthe trumpet sounds, and notwithstanding their sufferings they turn and\r\nalign themselves up in military order. In this test of obedience and\r\ndiscipline, it is said, only five of the mares obeyed the signal (some\r\nsay only three) and thus the mares that obeyed, notwithstanding their\r\nsufferings, became justly entitled to the distinctive and honored name of\r\n“The Prophet’s Mares.” Another story is told of the particular markings\r\nwhich, in the Prophet’s estimation, indicated the best horses. By one\r\nauthority he always selected a black horse with a white “forehead,” and\r\nsome white mark or marks on his upper lip. Another authority says he\r\nalways chose a bay horse with a bald face and four white legs, and so\r\nwe might go on till we had embraced every color and every combination\r\nof marks, and we would then find that each “authority” had a horse to\r\nsell corresponding with the Prophet’s preferences. Now the fact is that\r\nMohammed was neither a horseman nor a horse breeder, and the whole tenor\r\nof history goes to show that he neither knew nor cared very much about\r\nhorses. In his first pilgrimage to Mecca, after the battles referred to\r\nabove, the privilege for which was secured by negotiation, a hundred\r\nhorsemen, it is said, were started and kept one day’s journey in advance\r\nof the main body of pilgrims. The great numbers following Mohammed on\r\nthis pilgrimage admonished his old enemies of Mecca of the futility of\r\nattempting to resist his power longer, and they fled from the city during\r\nthe continuance of the ceremonies. A year or two later he summoned all\r\nthe tribes of Northern and Eastern Arabia to follow him again to Mecca,\r\nand they had too lively a sense of their own safety to disobey. Due time\r\nwas given for preparation, the rendezvous was at Medina, and a vast host\r\nfrom all Northern and Western Arabia congregated there for a purpose that\r\nmight be to fight, or it might be to pray. Mohammed mounted his camel\r\nand the word was passed, “On to Mecca.” As against such a multitude the\r\nMeccans saw that resistance was hopeless, and the city was surrendered\r\nwithout either side striking a blow. Arrayed in great splendor and\r\nmounted on his camel, the Prophet made the requisite number of circuits\r\nround the holy place and then entered and ordered all the idols that\r\nhad been set up there to be destroyed, and his followers then shouted,\r\n“Allah is Allah, and Mohammed is his Prophet!” Thus he became master of\r\nall Arabia—and woe to the Christian or the Jew who stood in his way. Two\r\nyears afterward he died, and there is nothing in his life or history to\r\nindicate that he ever owned a horse or that he ever mounted one, except\r\non a single occasion. In the ten short years of his public life he had\r\nsomething more important on hand than to determine how to breed horses.\r\n\r\nIn studying the Arabian horse in the light of what he has done and what\r\nhe has failed to do, we are indebted to English writers for little\r\nsnatches of experiences extending back for a period of about two hundred\r\nand fifty years. The earliest English writer who has had anything to say\r\nabout the Arabian horse was the Duke of Newcastle, who seems to have\r\nknown a great deal about the various types and breeds of horses of his\r\nday. During the period of the Commonwealth it appears he devoted his\r\ntime, in the Netherlands, to training horses in the _manege_ of that day.\r\nFrom his experience in this employment he became an expert in the form,\r\nstructure, and docility of the different kinds of horses that he handled.\r\nWhen Charles II. was brought back and placed upon the throne, the duke\r\nalso came to his own, and being a personal friend of the king he became\r\nhis counselor and adviser in all matters relating to the improvement of\r\nthe horses of the realm. In 1667 the duke published his famous book upon\r\nthe horse, in which he speaks right out on any and every question that\r\nhe touches. There can be no doubt that he knew more about horses and\r\nhorse history than any man of his day. In speaking of the Arabian horse\r\nhe says: “I never saw but one of these horses, which Mr. John Markham, a\r\nmerchant, brought over, and said he was a right Arabian. He was a bay,\r\nbut a little horse, and no rarity for shape, for I have seen many English\r\nhorses far finer. Mr. Markham sold him to King James for five hundred\r\npounds, and being trained up for a course (race), when he came to run\r\nevery horse beat him.”\r\n\r\nIt is generally held that this Markham Arabian was the first of that\r\nbreed ever brought to England, and this seems to be established by the\r\nfact that historians antedating his arrival make no mention of any\r\nArabian horse before this one, and those following always speak of this\r\nhorse as the first. In speaking of the powers of endurance of the Arabian\r\nhorse, the duke says: “They talk they will ride fourscore miles in a day\r\nand never draw the bridle. When I was young I could have bought a nag\r\nfor ten pounds that would have done as much very easily.” The duke’s\r\nmasterful knowledge of the subject, as well as his special official\r\nrelations to the king, gave him control of whatever was done or attempted\r\nin the direction of improving the racing stock of England. Tradition\r\ninforms us that “King Charles II. sent abroad the master of the horse\r\nto procure a number of foreign horses and mares for breeding, and the\r\nmares brought over by him (as also many of their produce) have since been\r\ncalled Royal Mares.” It is very doubtful whether any such importation\r\nwas ever made. The question has been discussed, from time to time and\r\neven recently, but nobody has ever yet discovered who was “Master of the\r\nHorse,” to what country he was sent or what the character of the mares\r\nhe brought home, or where he got them. The fair presumption is that\r\nthese “Royal Mares” were myths and that they were created merely for the\r\npurpose of putting a finish on certain very uncertain pedigrees, just as\r\na trotting-horse man would finish a pedigree that he knew nothing about\r\nby saying, “out of a thoroughbred mare.” As a matter of course it has\r\nalways been assumed that these “Royal Mares” were of distinctively pure\r\nArabian blood. But, if we admit that such an importation was really made,\r\nwe must consider that it was made under the direction and control of the\r\nDuke of Newcastle, the king’s mentor in all horse affairs, and this is\r\nsufficient proof that there was no Arabian blood about the “Royal Mares.”\r\nAs the size of the English race horse and especially his weight of bone\r\ncommenced to increase soon after this time, it strikes me as probable\r\nthat this was the wise and guiding motive of the duke in making his\r\nselections of the “Royal Mares.”\r\n\r\nWhen we come down a little nearer to our own times and step across the\r\nborder from the seventeenth to the eighteenth century, we are still\r\nin the realm of traditions, and many of them very preposterous. The\r\ndeceptions practiced in nomenclature were so common as to be well-nigh\r\nuniversal. Everybody who owned a foreign horse must have “Arabian”\r\nattached to his name. To illustrate this evil and the misleading effects\r\nflowing from it, I will give two instances of the most famous horses\r\nin all English history. The Darley Arabian and the Godolphin Arabian\r\nstand pre-eminent and before all others as progenitors of the English\r\nrace horse. The former of these two was purchased at Aleppo, in Asia\r\nMinor, and brought to England in 1711, by Mr. Darley of Yorkshire who\r\nsecured him through a brother in trade in that region. He was the sire of\r\nFlying Childers and many others, and his blood carried from generation\r\nto generation. Aleppo is in Northern Syria and far distant from Arabia.\r\nAt one time it was embraced in Armenia Minor, the original home of the\r\nhorse, and adjoined Cappadocia and Cilicia, all famous for the excellence\r\nof their horse stock more than two thousand years before there was a\r\nsingle horse in Arabia. Upon the restoration of the ancient Theban line\r\nof Pharaohs in Egypt, at the beginning of the eighteenth dynasty, no time\r\nwas lost by Thutmosis I. in leading a great army into Northern Syria for\r\nno other purpose that is apparent except to replenish and reinvigorate\r\nthe horse stock of Egypt, from the region of Aleppo and further east, for\r\nthis is the region from which they had secured their original stock. His\r\nsuccessors pursued the same course, year after year, and the number of\r\nhorses and chariots captured in battle, as well as the number of mares\r\nsent as tribute by the frightened people, were duly recorded in the\r\nannals of their achievements. If the Darley Arabian, so called, bore any\r\nrelationship whatever to the Arabian horse, it can only be established\r\nby tracing him back to some one of the animals in Cappadocia that the\r\nEmperor Constantius sent to Arabia in the year A.D. 356. A writer of\r\nthe seventeenth century, Dr. Alexander Bursell, in speaking of Aleppo,\r\nsays: “Formerly this part of the country was famous for fine horses; and\r\nthough many good ones are still bred here, it may be said they are much\r\ndegenerated.” This is the observation of an intelligent man, written and\r\npublished in 1756, about forty years after Mr. Darley’s horse was brought\r\nfrom there.\r\n\r\nThe other illustration is that of Godolphin Arabian. As a progenitor of\r\nrace horses this was the greatest horse of his century, or indeed of any\r\nother century in the history of the English race horse. He died in 1753,\r\nand absolutely nothing is known of his origin or his early history. The\r\nstory is generally accepted, and I suppose is true, that he was bought\r\nout of a cart in Paris, as an act of humanity, by a Mr. Coke, taken to\r\nLondon, presented to Mr. Williams, the keeper of a coffee-house, and\r\npassed from him to Lord Godolphin, who kept him till he died. The story\r\nthat he was presented to Louis XV. by the Bey of Tunis in 1731 has never\r\nbeen verified in any manner, and breaks down on the vital point of date.\r\nSome intelligent Englishmen insist that he _must have been_ an Arabian,\r\nwhile others insist that he _must have been_ a Barb, while no man\r\n_knows_ whether he was either one or the other. With the most prominent\r\nhorses of the nation and of their century thus used to mislead the public\r\nmind as to their lineage, what are we to expect from the great ruck of\r\nthe obscure and less prominent? But, as a more elaborate and methodical\r\ndiscussion of this topic will be found in the chapter on the English\r\nand American Race Horse, we will now turn our attention to the actual\r\nexperiences with the Arabians in recent times.\r\n\r\nWhen we come down to the present century we get into the era of\r\nnewspapers that really begun to give the news, and thus educate their\r\nreaders, not very authentically, but circumstantially, in what was\r\npassing in the world in every department of knowledge and enterprise.\r\nUnder these wide sources of information, a few authentic experiences\r\nwill serve to illustrate the true status of the Arabian horse and his\r\ninfluence, or lack of influence, on English and American horses. More\r\nthan twenty years ago the Prince of Wales made a royal progress through\r\nHer Majesty’s dominions in the East. The enthusiasm was unbounded and he\r\nwas loaded down with many valuable presents, among them several elegant,\r\nhigh-caste Arabian horses. It appears that some of these horses had\r\nalready won reputation and money on the turf, and were considered the\r\nvery best that could be found in the East. On their arrival they were\r\ngreatly admired and praised, especially by the sporting friends of the\r\nprince, who seemed to have no doubt, nor did they conceal their opinions,\r\nthat they could beat any horses in all England. This was a conclusion\r\nthat a great many racing men, with longer memories, could not accept,\r\nand after a good deal of diplomacy a match was finally concluded between\r\nthe prince’s best horse and an old horse that was third or fourth-class,\r\nin his prime, but was unsound and liable to break down any time he was\r\nextended. The prince was popular, had many supporters, and much money\r\nwas pending. The old horse was patched up as well as possible, the day\r\ncame, the race was started, and the old cripple was so much faster than\r\nthe Arab that his managers had the hardest work in the world to prevent\r\nhim from running clear away and disgracing the prince. This account of\r\nthe race I had from one of the most eminent and successful trainers\r\nthat England has produced. He witnessed the race and knew all the facts\r\nconcerning it. Notwithstanding the popularity of the prince and the\r\nuniversal feeling of loyalty toward him, it was a long time before his\r\nArabs ceased to be a laughing-stock among horsemen.\r\n\r\nSome sixteen or eighteen years ago, an English gentleman of wealth and\r\nintelligence—Mr. Wilfrid S. Blunt—got it into his head that the way\r\nto improve the English race horse was to secure fresh infusions of\r\npure Arabian blood. He was industrious in propagating his fad, in an\r\namateurish way, through the columns of the English newspapers, evincing\r\ngreat zeal and a great lack of knowledge of the hundreds of experiments\r\nin the same direction and in the history of his own country that had\r\nproved disastrous. But he had a will of his own and a bank account that\r\nenabled him to carry out his views to their own realization. In the\r\nautumn of 1877 he made up a pleasant family party, consisting of his\r\nwife, Lady Anne, and two of her lady friends and started for Arabia, with\r\nthe full determination to find the best and to buy nothing that was not\r\nof the purest and best lineage that could be found in all that country.\r\nFortunately, Lady Anne carefully noted down everything that transpired in\r\ntheir journeyings and after the return wrote a very pleasant and readable\r\nbook, understood to have been edited by her husband in some of its\r\nfeatures. The title of the book—“The Bedouin Tribes of the Euphrates”—did\r\nnot strike me pleasantly, for I never knew that any of the numerous\r\nBedouin tribes were to be found on the Euphrates. But my purpose is not\r\nto criticise either the book or its title, but to follow the party over\r\nits itinerary and discover just where Mr. Blunt found the blood he was\r\nlooking for, and upon what evidence he accepted it as “the best blood.”\r\nWith this view I will carefully give his own language, so far as it\r\napplies to the point in view.\r\n\r\nHis first purchase was at Aleppo, where he got a mare he named Hagar, as\r\nhe says, “for a very moderate sum.” “She was of the Kehilan-Ajuz breed.”\r\n“When purchased she was in very poor condition, having just gone through\r\nthe severe training of a campaign.” “She was bred by the Gommussa, the\r\nmost able of the horse-breeding tribes, had passed from them to the\r\nRoala, and had now been captured and ridden some two hundred miles, in\r\nhot haste, for sale to Aleppo.” “We never met anything in our travels\r\nthat could compete with her over a distance, and she has often run down\r\nfoxes and even hares, without assistance, carrying thirteen stone on her\r\nback.” This was the first experience of the English “tenderfoot” among\r\nSyrian horsethieves. According to his own showing, he bought her from\r\nthe fellow who had stolen her and had ridden her two hundred miles to\r\nescape, and he accepted what the thief told about the breeding of the\r\nmare as true. The thief knew just what Mr. Blunt wanted and he shaped the\r\npedigree and tracing to suit the purchaser. Mr. Blunt had no knowledge of\r\nthis mare’s breeding, nor where she came from; still, her blood was to\r\nbecome one of the great influences in renovating the English race horse.\r\nThis incident is of no importance, in itself, except as it illustrates\r\nthe universal conditions under which amateurs buy horses in the Orient.\r\n\r\nUpon leaving Aleppo, the party traveled eastward till they struck the\r\nEuphrates and then down the right bank of that river. The first town\r\nof any importance was Deyr, on the river, and just across was ancient\r\nMesopotamia. They were still in the border land between the productive\r\nnorth and the desert south, with the Syrian desert between them and the\r\nArabian desert. All this region is occupied with a mixture of races,\r\nemployed in varied pursuits, with but a feeble trace of tribal authority,\r\nas all are under the direct government of the Sultan of Turkey.\r\n\r\n    “Deyr is well-known,” Mr. Blunt says, “as a horse market, and\r\n    is, perhaps, the only town north of the Jebel Shammar where\r\n    the inhabitants have any general knowledge of the blood and\r\n    breeding of the beasts they possess. The townsmen, indeed, are\r\n    but a single step removed from the Bedouins, their undoubted\r\n    ancestors. They usually purchase their colts as yearlings\r\n    either from the Gomussa, or some of the Sabaa tribes, and\r\n    having broken them thoroughly, sell them at three years old\r\n    to the Aleppo merchants. They occasionally, too, have mares\r\n    left with them, in partnership, by the Anazah, and from\r\n    these they breed according to the strictest desert rules. It\r\n    is, therefore, for a stranger, by far the best market for\r\n    thoroughbreds in Asia, and you may get some of the best blood\r\n    at Deyr that can be found anywhere, besides having a guarantee\r\n    of its authenticity, impossible, under ordinary circumstances,\r\n    to get at Damascus or Aleppo. There are, I may say, no horses\r\n    at Deyr but thoroughbreds.”\r\n\r\nHe made some purchases at Deyr and then they pursued their journey down\r\nthe river, and at the most convenient point he crossed over to Bagdad,\r\non the Tigris. Here he inspected the stud of the Turkish pasha, but the\r\nprices were high and he seemed to lack confidence in the purity of their\r\nbreeding. Whatever the cause, he made no purchases, and soon started\r\non his journey up the Tigris. Upon reaching Sherghat on the Tigris,\r\nhe turned westward, and crossing ancient Mesopotamia, he was again at\r\nDeyr, where he seems to have made more purchases, and then started, in\r\na southwesterly direction, with eighteen mares and two stallions for\r\nDamascus and the coast. This closed the search of Arabia for Arabian\r\nhorses of the highest caste and purest blood, without really being in\r\nArabia, and this is all that can be said of “The Bedouin Tribes of the\r\nEuphrates”—without having seen a real Bedouin.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Mr. Blunt thinks he is right in his high appreciation of\r\nthe town of Deyr as a horse market; that it is “the best market for\r\nthoroughbreds in Asia;” and that “there are no horses in Deyr but\r\nthoroughbreds,” or he would not have bought his horses there. Dealing\r\nin horses seems to be the principal business of the people, they are\r\nall well informed on the best and purest strains of blood, according to\r\nMr. Blunt, and all their own horses are thoroughbred. Truly an ideal\r\nmarket, an ideal people, and ideal horses, just suited to the needs\r\nof enthusiastic amateurs like Mr. Blunt. This remarkable horse town\r\nis located on the border between the rich grain fields and luxuriant\r\nmeadows on the north, and the comparatively barren deserts of the south.\r\nOn the north the country has been famous for thousands of years for the\r\ngreat numbers and excellence of the horses produced, and they are still\r\nproduced of excellent form and quality, and are sold at very low prices.\r\nOn the south is the land of the camel, and but few horses and those few\r\nheld at high prices, and the simple term “Arabian horse” always brings\r\nthem purchasers. Here, then, we find that Deyr is the very paradise of\r\nhorse traders—a tribe, wherever we find them on the face of the earth,\r\ndistinguished for elasticity of conscience. The north furnishes the\r\nhorses and the south furnishes the pedigrees, and no wonder the Deyrites\r\nhad nothing but “thoroughbreds” when Mr. Blunt came along. In the line\r\nof their business and from their southern neighbors, they had picked up\r\nenough “Arabian horse talk” to satisfy all inexperienced buyers that\r\nthey knew all about the value of the different strains of Arabian blood,\r\nand could supply them from their own studs, at very reasonable prices.\r\nAnd thus Mr. Blunt brought home to England eighteen “Arabian” mares and\r\ntwo stallions, without any satisfactory evidence that they ever had seen\r\nArabia. In this enthusiastic venture, resulting in utter failure, there\r\nis one alleviating fact that Mr. Blunt can call to mind, and that is that\r\nhis horses were just as good for the purpose of improving the English\r\nrace horse as any others that have been brought from the Orient in the\r\npast hundred years. Whatever their blood, whether genuine or counterfeit\r\nArabians, they have all alike been failures, and all alike good for\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nEarly in the history of our own government it became not an unusual\r\nthing for the Sultan of Turkey, the Emperor of Morocco, or some other\r\npotentate of the Saracenic races, to present to the President two horses,\r\nand as they were presents from royalty to what they esteemed royalty,\r\nthey were necessarily of the highest caste and of the greatest value of\r\nany horses in all their dominions. It is probable that Mr. Jefferson\r\nwas the first president to receive these royal gifts, and under the\r\nrequirements of the constitution and without any disrespect to the donor,\r\nhe ordered them to be sold to the highest bidder, and turned the money\r\ninto the treasury. Several of the presidents received these presents of\r\nhorses, and without knowing the fact, I will presume disposed of them\r\nthe same way. In the case of President Lincoln, Mr. Seward seemed to\r\nbe more highly favored and the sultan sent the horses to him. Through\r\nthe State Agricultural Society, Mr. Seward presented his royal presents\r\nto the State of New York. My recollection is not very distinct, but\r\nmy impression is that Mr. Van Buren had disposed of his in the same\r\nway. When General Grant received his, he was not in public office and\r\nhence they became his personal property. A number of the first of these\r\nimportations, together with some others that were brought from Arabia,\r\nindividually and by private persons, were, in the early part of the\r\ncentury, carried into the South, which was then the “race-horse region,”\r\nbut the breeders there very soon discovered that in breeding from them\r\nthey were taking a backward instead of a forward step. Their progeny\r\ncould neither run nor trot, and as they were too small for the ordinary\r\nuses of the farmer and planter, they were almost unanimously rejected,\r\nwith nothing left but the ignorant “fad” that was embodied in the name\r\n“Arabian.”\r\n\r\nThe most notable example of the folly of attempting to regenerate the\r\nAmerican race horse by the introduction of the “blood of the desert”\r\nis furnished in the sad experience of the late A. Keene Richards, of\r\nKentucky. He inherited a large estate, and when he came into possession\r\nhe proved himself an intelligent and successful breeder, and ran the\r\ncolts of his own breeding, with a full share of winnings. He was not a\r\nspendthrift nor a gambler, but he was not content with mediocrity in\r\nsharing triumphs with his neighbors, for he was ambitious to beat, them\r\nall. He soon had his head full of such horses as the Darley Arabian and\r\nthe Godolphin Arabian, and he argued if that blood founded the English\r\nrace horse, he would go to Arabia and get it, and it could not fail to\r\nregenerate the American race horse. He did not stop to inquire whether\r\neither of his great ideals might have had a drop of Arabian blood in his\r\nveins, but he started for Arabia at once. He brought home a few stallions\r\nand felt sure he was on the eve of the greatest triumph of his life. When\r\nthe half-Arab produce of his strong and elegantly bred race mares were\r\nold enough to run the jockey club allowed the half-breeds seven pounds\r\nthe advantage in weight and they were beaten. The club then allowed them\r\nfourteen pounds and they were again beaten; and finally the allowance was\r\nraised to twenty-one pounds, and they were still in the rear rank. Under\r\nthese humiliating defeats a careful man would have hesitated before he\r\nwent further, but he at once jumped to the conclusion that his defeat\r\nwas not in the fact that Arab blood could not run fast enough to win,\r\nbut in the fact, as he supposed, that the rascally Arabs had sold him\r\nblood that was not Arab blood. In a short time he was off for Arabia\r\nagain, taking with him as companion and adviser the distinguished animal\r\npainter, Troye, who had a long and successful experience as a delineator\r\nof race horses and knew all about the anatomy of the horse. They spent\r\nseveral months among the different tribes, and in order to get “inside\r\nof the ring,” as it were, they ate with the Arabs, slept with the Arabs,\r\nand worshiped with the Arabs, as Mr. Richards told me himself. They came\r\nhome full of the highest expectations, bringing several mares as well as\r\nstallions with them, and fully assured that every one was of the highest\r\ncaste and the best form for racing that could be found on all the plains\r\nof the desert. After the foals of this importation were old enough to\r\nstart in the stakes, they were given the same advantages in weight as\r\nbefore, and they proved no better than the first lot. Poor Mr. Richards\r\nwas crushed in spirits, not only by the vanishing of his air castles,\r\nbut by the importunacy of his creditors. In his heroic, but misguided,\r\nefforts to improve the American race horse by infusions of pure Arabian\r\nblood, he involved his once handsome estate, and he died hopelessly\r\ninsolvent. He had bred a number of pure Arabs of several generations, but\r\nthe abundant feed and luxuriant blue grass of Kentucky did not increase\r\ntheir size, for when they came under the auctioneer’s hammer they were\r\nbut little “tackeys,” and they brought only the price of little “tackeys.”\r\n\r\nThe number of horses brought to this country, whether as gifts to\r\nstatesmen or as private ventures, and called “Arabians,” is not very\r\nlarge, and it is safe to say that not one in ten of them ever saw Arabia.\r\nThey came from Turkey or some of the Barbary States. But in the case\r\nof Mr. Richards there can be no doubt that he made his selections in\r\nArabia itself. Those selections having been made personally and with\r\ncare and skill, we are bound to accept them as genuine Arabians. When\r\nwe find, therefore, that having been tested they are no better than the\r\nhorses brought from Turkey or from Africa, we must conclude that the\r\nwhole scheme is mere moonshine, and that Arabian blood as a means of\r\nimprovement has failed to develop the value that enthusiasts and dreamers\r\nhave claimed for it since “time whereof the memory of man runneth not to\r\nthe contrary.” Practical and thinking men always judge of the value of\r\na breed of horses from what the representatives of that breed can do or\r\nwhat they fail to do. The emotional and unpractical are always looking\r\nfor an ideal horse, and the poets and story writers are always furnishing\r\nthem one. Where a horse figures in a story he is uniformly endowed with\r\nan almost supernatural intelligence and sense. To finish up the ideal\r\nhorse, he always traces back to the “Courser of the Desert.” If his\r\ntriumph is in a flight of speed, he distances all competitors because\r\nhe is a pure Arabian. The story of “Ben Hur,” written by General Lew\r\nWallace, furnishes a fitting illustration of this tendency of the public\r\nmind. The story of the chariot race at Antioch is a masterpiece of most\r\nexciting ingenuity, and one of the finest specimens of word painting in\r\nthe English language. The irascible old sheik is quite overdrawn, but the\r\njudgment and skill of Ben Hur cannot be surpassed. As a matter of course,\r\nthe team of black Arabians was bound to win. Every bright schoolboy in\r\nthe country has read the story, and he has joined in the triumph of the\r\nblack Arabians. The wide interest in the chariot race seemed to demand\r\nits pictorial delineation, and soon the public was gratified with a large\r\nand elegant etching, which hangs before me as I write. The only trouble\r\nabout this excellent work of the imagination and the team of black\r\nArabians is that there were no horses in Arabia till about three hundred\r\nand fifty years after the date of this supposed scene. We must let the\r\npoets sing and the novelists work out their plots, but it is well to pay\r\nsome attention to the facts and experiences of history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GODOLPHIN ARABIAN.\r\n\r\nA true portrait taken from life by D. Murrier, painter to H. R.

Much has been claimed for him\r\nand much has been written about him, in a haphazard way, by people who\r\nknow but little of the subject. A few men of independent and real thought\r\nhave written on this subject, but they have devoted their attention to\r\nthe comparing of family with family or individual with individual. Of\r\nthe books that have been written by brainless people on the English\r\nhorse there is no end, and they are generally mere repetitions, without\r\ngiving credit, of what somebody has said before. Among all the books\r\nthat have been written on this subject I have never yet found one that\r\neven pretended to make a serious attempt at discovering the real origin\r\nof the English Race Horse. They all seem to agree with Admiral Rous that\r\nhe is purely descended from the Arabian horse, and without one drop of\r\nthe blood of the indigenous English horse. The average writer for the\r\ntwo past centuries has been content with just this much knowledge, and\r\nhe wants nothing more. Occasionally it is modestly suggested in some\r\nmagazine article that this exclusively Arabian origin may not be true,\r\nand I am glad to note that these suggestions are becoming more frequent\r\nof late years. It has been claimed that the pure Arabian origin of the\r\nrace horse “is as solid as a pyramid,” all of which may be accepted—but,\r\nunfortunately for the claimant, the “pyramid” is standing on its apex,\r\nand when the facts breathe upon it, as gently as a zephyr, it will topple\r\nover. The most convenient and the most authoritative collection of facts\r\nrelating to the earliest exotic horses that were brought in is to be\r\nfound in the English Stud Book itself, and as but few of my readers have\r\naccess to this work, I will copy that portion of it entire, as it appears\r\nin the first volume, and the edition of 1803. In the edition of 1808 the\r\nlist was reprinted with four additional animals and some verbal changes,\r\nwhich, when important, will be noted.\r\n\r\n    “ARABIANS, BARBS AND TURKS.”\r\n\r\n    1. The Helmsley Turk was an old Duke of Buckingham’s and got\r\n    Bustler, etc.\r\n\r\n    2. Place’s White Turk was the property of Mr. Place, studmaster\r\n    to Oliver Cromwell, when Protector, and was the sire of\r\n    Wormwood Commoner, and the great grandams of Windham, Grey\r\n    Ramsden and Cartouch.\r\n\r\n    3. Royal Mares: King Charles the Second sent abroad the master\r\n    of the horse, to procure a number of foreign horses and mares\r\n    for breeding, and the mares brought over by him (as also many\r\n    of their produce) have since been called Royal Mares.\r\n\r\n    4. Dodsworth, though foaled in England, was a natural Barb.\r\n    His dam, a Barb mare, was imported in the time of Charles\r\n    the Second, and was called a Royal Mare. She was sold by the\r\n    studmaster, after the king’s death, for forty guineas, at\r\n    twenty years old, when in foal (by the Helmsley Turk) with\r\n    Vixen, dam of the Old Child Mare.\r\n\r\n    5. The Stradling or Lister Turk was brought into England by the\r\n    Duke of Berwick, from the siege of Buda, in the reign of James\r\n    the Second. He got Snake, the D. of Kingston’s Brisk and Piping\r\n    Peg, Coneyskins, the dam of Hip, and the grandam of Bolton\r\n    Sweepstakes.\r\n\r\n    6. The Byerly Turk was Captain Byerly’s charger in Ireland,\r\n    in King William’s wars (1869, etc.). He did not cover many\r\n    bred mares, but was the sire of D. of Kingston’s Sprite, who\r\n    was thought nearly as good as Leedes; the D. of Rutland’s\r\n    Black Hearty and Archer, and the D. of Devonshire’s Basto, Ld.\r\n    Bristol’s Grasshopper, and Ld. Godolphin’s Byerly Gelding,\r\n    all in good forms: Halloway’s Jigg, a middling horse; and\r\n    Knightley’s Mare, in a very good form.\r\n\r\n    7. Greyhound. The cover of this foal was in Barbary, after\r\n    which both his sire and dam were purchased, and brought into\r\n    England by Mr. Marshall. He was got by King William’s White\r\n    Barb Chillaby, out of Slugey, a natural Barb Mare. Greyhound\r\n    got the D. of Wharton’s Othello, said to have beat Chanter\r\n    easily in a trial, giving him a stone, but who, falling lame,\r\n    ran only one match in public, against a bad horse; he also got\r\n    Panton’s Whitefoot, a very good horse; Osmyn, a very fleet\r\n    horse and in good form for his size; the D. of Wharton’s Rake,\r\n    a middling horse; Ld. Halifax’s Sampson, Goliah and Favorite,\r\n    pretty good 12-stone Plate horses; Desdemona, and other good\r\n    mares, and several ordinary Plate horses, who ran in the North\r\n    where he was a common stallion and covered many of the best\r\n    mares.\r\n\r\n    8. The D’Arcy White Turk was the sire of Old Hautboy, Grey\r\n    Royal, Cannon, etc.\r\n\r\n    9. The D’Arcy Yellow Turk was the sire of Spanker, Brimmer, and\r\n    the great-great-grandam of Cartouch.\r\n\r\n    10. The Marshall or Selaby Turk was the property of Mr.\r\n    Marshall’s brother, studmaster to King William, Queen Anne, and\r\n    King George the first. He got the Curwen Old Spot, the dam of\r\n    Windham, the dam of Derby Ticklepitcher, and great-grandam of\r\n    Bolton Sloven and Fearnought.\r\n\r\n    11. Curwen’s Bay Barb was a present to Louis the Fourteenth\r\n    from Muley Ishmael, King of Morocco, and was brought into\r\n    England by Mr. Curwen, who being in France when Count Byram\r\n    and Count Thoulouse (two natural sons of Louis the Fourteenth)\r\n    were, the former, master of the horse, and the latter an\r\n    admiral, he procured of them two Barb horses, both of which\r\n    proved excellent stallions, and were well known by the names\r\n    of the Curwen Bay Barb and the Thoulouse Barb. Curwen’s Bay\r\n    Barb got Mixbury and Tantivy, both very excellent formed\r\n    Galloways. The first of them was only thirteen hands two\r\n    inches high, and yet there were not more than two horses of\r\n    his time that could beat him at light weights. Brocklesby,\r\n    Little George, Yellow Jack, Bay Jack, Monkey, Dangerfield, Hip,\r\n    Peacock, and Flatface, the first two in good forms, the rest\r\n    middling; two Mixburys, full brothers to the first Mixbury,\r\n    middling Galloways; Long Meg, Brocklesby Betty, and Creeping\r\n    Molly, extraordinarily high-formed mares; Whiteneck, Mistake,\r\n    Sparkler, and Lightfoot, very good mares, and several middling\r\n    Galloways, who ran for Plates in the North. He got two full\r\n    sisters to Mixbury, one of which bred Partner, Little Scar,\r\n    Soreheels and the dam of Crab; the other was the dam of Quiet,\r\n    Silver Eye and Hazard. He did not cover many mares except Mr.\r\n    Curwen’s and Mr. Pelham’s.\r\n\r\n    12. The Thoulouse Barb became afterward the property of Sir J.\r\n    Parsons and was the sire of Bagpiper, Blacklegs, Mr. Panton’s\r\n    Molly, and the dam of Cinnamon.\r\n\r\n    13. Darley’s Arabian was brought over by a brother of Mr.\r\n    Darley, of Yorkshire, who, being an agent in merchandise\r\n    abroad, became member of a hunting club, by which means he\r\n    acquired interest to procure this horse. He was the sire\r\n    of Childers, and also got Almanzor, a very good horse; a\r\n    white-legged horse of the D. of Somerset’s, full brother to\r\n    Almanzor, and thought to be as good, but meeting with an\r\n    accident, he never ran in public; Cupid and Brisk, good horses;\r\n    Dædalus, a very swift horse; Dart, Shipjack, Maica and Aleppo,\r\n    good Plate horses, though out of bad mares; Ld. Lonsdale’s\r\n    Mare in very good form, and Ld. Tracy’s Mare in a good one for\r\n    Plates. He covered very few mares except Mr. Darley’s, who had\r\n    very few well-bred mares besides Almanzor’s Dam.\r\n\r\n    14. Sir J. William’s Turk (more commonly called the Honeywood\r\n    Arabian) got Mr. Honeywood’s two True Blues; the elder of them\r\n    was the best Plate horse in England, for four or five years;\r\n    the younger was in very high form and got the Rumford Gelding,\r\n    and Ld. Onslow’s Grey Horse, middling horses out of road mares.\r\n    It is not known that this Turk covered any bred mares except\r\n    the dam of the two True Blues.\r\n\r\n    15. The Belgrade Turk was taken at the siege of Belgrade, by\r\n    Gen. Merci, and sent by him to the Prince de Craon, from whom\r\n    he was a present to the Prince of Lorraine. He was afterward\r\n    purchased by Sir Marmaduke Wyvill, and died in his possession\r\n    about 1740.\r\n\r\n    16. Croft’s Bay Barb was got by Chillaby, out of the Moonah\r\n    Barb Mare.\r\n\r\n    17. The Godolphin Arabian was imported by Mr. Coke, at whose\r\n    death he became (together with Cade, Regulus, etc., then young)\r\n    the property of Ld. Godolphin. His first employment was that\r\n    of a teaser to Hobgoblin, who, refusing to cover Roxana, she\r\n    was put to the Arabian, and from that cover produced Lath, the\r\n    first of his get. He was also sire of Cade, Regulus, Blank,\r\n    etc., and what is considered very remarkable, as well as a\r\n    strong proof of his excellence as a stallion, there is not a\r\n    superior horse now on the turf without a cross of the Godolphin\r\n    Arabian, neither has there been for several years past. He was\r\n    a brown bay, with no white, except on the off heel behind, and\r\n    about fifteen hands high (a picture of him is in the library at\r\n    Gog Magog, Cambridgeshire). It is not known to what particular\r\n    race of the Arab breed, indeed it has been asserted that he was\r\n    a Barb. He died at Gog Magog in 1753, in or about the 29th year\r\n    of his age. The story of his playfellow, the black cat, must\r\n    not be omitted here, especially as an erroneous account has got\r\n    abroad, copied from the first introduction to the present work.\r\n    Instead of his grieving for the loss of the cat she survived\r\n    him, though but for a short time; she sat upon him after he\r\n    was dead in the building erected for him, and followed him to\r\n    the place where he was buried under a gateway near the running\r\n    stable; sat upon him there till he was buried, then went away,\r\n    and never was seen again, till found dead in the hayloft.\r\n\r\n    18. The Cullen Arabian was brought over by Mr. Nosco and was\r\n    sire of Mr. Warren’s Camillus, Ld. Orford’s Matron, Mr. Gorges’\r\n    Sour Face, the dam of Regulator, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n    19. The Coomb Arabian (sometimes called the Pigot Arabian\r\n    and sometimes the Bolingbroke Grey Arabian) was the sire of\r\n    Methodist, the dam of Crop, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n    20. The Compton Barb, more commonly called the Sedley Arabian,\r\n    was sire of Coquette, Greyling, etc.\r\n\r\n    (ADDITIONS IN 1808 EDITION.)\r\n\r\n    21. King James the First bought an Arabian of Mr. Markham, a\r\n    merchant, for 500gs., said (but with little probability) to\r\n    have been the first of the breed ever seen in England. The Duke\r\n    of Newcastle says, in his treatise on Horsemanship, that he had\r\n    seen the above Arabian, and describes him as a small bay horse,\r\n    and not of very excellent shape.\r\n\r\n    23. Bloody Buttocks; nothing further can be traced from the\r\n    papers of the late Mr. Crofts than that he was a grey Arabian,\r\n    with a red mark on his hip, from whence he derived his name.\r\n\r\n    23. The Vernon Arabian was a small chestnut horse. He covered\r\n    at Highflyer Hall, and was the sire of Alert, etc. Alert had\r\n    good speed for a short distance.\r\n\r\n    24 & 25. The Wellesley Grey, and Chestnut Arabians (so called)\r\n    were brought from the East, but evidently not Arabians. The\r\n    former was a horse of good shape, with the size and substance\r\n    of an English hunter.\r\n\r\nThis list of twenty-seven different animals, which for the sake of\r\nconvenience I have numbered, was presented to the public more than\r\na hundred years ago by Mr. Weatherby, the highest of all English\r\nauthorities, as the foundation stock from which the English race horse\r\nwas propagated. The uniform omission of dates of importations, etc.,\r\ndiscloses the fact that the compiler had no accurate knowledge of the\r\nanimals or their history, and that he was dependent largely upon very\r\nuncertain traditions for his information. It must not be understood that\r\nthe animals in this list were contemporaneous, or that the list embraces\r\nall the foreign animals that were brought in, but only those that were\r\nrecognized as of value in founding the breed.\r\n\r\nTo understand just what we have to consider, I will place here, in\r\njuxtaposition to the above list, the remark of Admiral Rous, at one\r\ntime the great race-horse authority of England, which expresses the\r\npopular opinion as to the origin of the race horse, that is practically\r\nuniversally held in all lands. The admiral says: “The British race horse\r\nis a pure Eastern exotic whose pedigree may be traced two thousand years,\r\nthe true son of Arabia Deserta, without a drop of English blood.” To\r\nreach the approximate truth on the issue here made, and to puncture this\r\nextravaganza is the work now before us.\r\n\r\nNumbers 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, were Turks, and to these we may\r\nadd Mr. Darley’s horse, known as the Darley Arabian, number 13, for he\r\nwas brought from Aleppo in Turkey, far removed from Arabia, and famous\r\nfor the great numbers and excellence of its horses many centuries before\r\nArabia had any horses. To carry horses, for sale, from the deserts of\r\nArabia, where they are scarce, to the region of Aleppo, where they are\r\nvery plenty, and of the highest quality, would be simply “carrying coals\r\nto Newcastle.” We may therefore safely conclude that the ten horses here\r\nenumerated were Turks.\r\n\r\nNumbers 4, 7, 11, 12, 16, 20 were Barbs, as they are named in the list.\r\nIt is a surprise to me that these six horses should be designated as\r\n“Barbs,” for it has been the usage of many generations to call these\r\nhorses “Arabians.” As late as 1819 the Dey of Algiers sent several\r\nAlgerine horses as a present to the Prince Regent of England, and they\r\nwere always spoken of as “Arabians.”\r\n\r\nNumbers 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 are all unsatisfactory as to their\r\norigin. Number 17—Lord Godolphin’s horse—is wholly unknown as to his\r\nblood elements, and further on his history will be considered. Number 18\r\n“was brought over,” but from whence nobody knows. Number 19 is in the\r\nsame condition, and not one of his different owners has been able to\r\ntell us anything about his origin. Number 21 was, possibly, an Arabian,\r\nbut the Duke of Newcastle, who knew the horse well, seems to have doubted\r\nhis genuineness on account of his inferiority. However this may have\r\nbeen, he preceded other importations so many years that it is not known\r\nthat he ever sired a colt, and as a progenitor we may as well strike\r\nhim out. Number 22 seems to be in darkness, and all efforts to find his\r\norigin having failed he may as well be classed as unknown. Number 23\r\nis furnished with no evidence that he was entitled to be classed as an\r\nArabian. Numbers 24 and 25 were confessedly not genuine.\r\n\r\nThis reduces the analysis to its lowest form and shows that in the\r\noriginal foundation stock, including Mr. Darley’s horse (13), there were\r\nten Turks and six Barbs that can be accepted with reasonable certainty.\r\nThis leaves eight so-called “Arabians,” from which we must eliminate\r\nnumbers 17, 21, 24, 25, leaving numbers 18, 19, 22, 23, without any\r\nevidence whatever that they were Arabians except in name. From these four\r\nrather obscure animals, therefore, according to the Rous dictum, the\r\nEnglish race horse must have derived every drop of his blood; and yet\r\nthere is not a scintilla of evidence either direct or inferential that\r\nany one of them, or the ancestors of any one of them, ever saw Arabia.\r\nFrom the custom of calling every horse from abroad an “Arabian,” that\r\nhas prevailed in England for more than two hundred years, it is fair to\r\nconclude that there was no Arabian blood in the foundation stock. It\r\nwas the blood of the Turks and the Barbs, commingled with that of the\r\nnative blood that had been bred to race for centuries, that furnished the\r\nfoundation of the modern English and American race horse.\r\n\r\nBlood in the race horse is an imperative necessity, but it must be blood\r\nthat has been carefully selected from winners, and raced for generations,\r\nor it is of no value as an element of speed. If the English race horse\r\nhad been a strictly pure exotic from Arabia Deserta, as Admiral Rous\r\nmaintained, he would have been of no value either as a race horse or the\r\nprogenitor of race horses, without many generations of careful selection\r\nand development of speed.\r\n\r\nThe Godolphin Arabian was altogether the greatest horse of his century.\r\nHe flourished during most of the reign of King George II., but the\r\nhorsemen of the world, even Englishmen themselves, know far more about\r\nhim than they do about the reign of that monarch. Still, nobody knows\r\nanything of his birthplace, his origin or his blood. He was to the\r\nEnglish race horse what Rysdyk’s Hambletonian has been to the American\r\ntrotter. Neither of them was ever in a race, but each of them stood\r\nimmeasurably superior to all others of his day as a progenitor of speed,\r\nat his own gait. From the latter we had reason to expect speed because we\r\nknew he inherited speed, but from the former we had no reason to expect\r\nanything, for we knew nothing of what he inherited until he proved his\r\ninheritance by what he transmitted to his progeny. Some of the principal\r\nsemi-tragic incidents, so far as known in the early life of Godolphin\r\nArabian, were seized upon by the great novelist Eugene Sue, and out of\r\nthem grew a “horse novel” from his gifted pen. The horse was foaled\r\nabout 1724, was brought to England from France about 1730, and died\r\nat Magog Hills, 1753. There seems to be a substantial agreement among\r\nthose who had the best opportunities to know that the horse was employed\r\non the streets of Paris as a common drudge in a cart and driven by a\r\nbrutal master. A Mr. Coke, who is represented to have been a Quaker, was\r\nin Paris on business and he happened to witness the brutality of the\r\nruffian who was this horse’s master in trying to make him draw a load\r\nof wood up a steep acclivity on to a new bridge, which the horse after\r\nrepeated trials and clubbings was unable to accomplish. To relieve the\r\npoor brute from his sufferings, Mr. Coke’s feelings of humanity asserted\r\nthemselves, and he stepped forward and bought the horse on the spot and\r\nhad him released from the cart. Mr. Coke, it is said, brought the horse\r\nto London and presented him to Mr. Williams, the proprietor of a famous\r\ncoffee-house, and Mr. Williams presented him to Earl Godolphin.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1829, Mr. John S. Skinner commenced the publication of the\r\nfirst horse magazine that ever appeared in this country, and in the first\r\nnumber there appeared a steel engraving purporting to be executed by the\r\nfamous Stubbs and to represent the great horse, Godolphin Arabian. Not\r\nmany years afterward I came into possession of a copy of this publication\r\nfrom the beginning, and the sight of this picture always impressed me\r\nas the most ludicrous abortion of the likeness of a horse that could be\r\nconceived of. The neck was absolutely longer than the body, the legs\r\nwere about strong enough for a sheep, and all over it lacked strength of\r\nboth muscle and bone to a most absurd extent. When this picture appeared\r\nin London, some years before, it was laughed at by all artists as\r\nwell as by all men who knew anything about the shape of a horse, as a\r\nmonstrosity, and it was received in the same spirit on this side of the\r\nwater; but it bore the name of a great artist and that was sufficient to\r\nsecure the approbation of the unthinking and the unknowing. The only key\r\nto the origin of the horse, the only pedigree that can be given, must be\r\nfound written in his own structure of bone and muscle and brain. A true\r\ndelineation, therefore, of his form and shape became a matter of the\r\nhighest moment, not merely to satisfy the curiosity of the curious, but\r\nas a study of the true sources of his wonderful prepotency.\r\n\r\nSixty-five years ago a correspondent of Mr. Skinner’s magazine, referred\r\nto above, and a descendant of Mr. Samuel Galloway of Maryland, spoke of\r\nan oil painting of Godolphin Arabian that had hung in the hall at Tulip\r\nHill from the days of his childhood as still hanging there, and said\r\nthat it was wholly unlike the Stubbs engraving. Mr. Galloway was one of\r\nMaryland’s land barons, an enthusiastic horse breeder, and a successful\r\nhorse racer. He was educated at Cambridge, I think; and if so, no doubt\r\nhe saw Godolphin Arabian many times before he died, for he was within\r\nfour or five miles of him, and his sporting instincts could not fail to\r\ntake him to see so great a horse when so near at hand. As he was a young\r\nman of great wealth and great ambitions, it is quite probable he was on\r\nterms of friendly acquaintance, if not intimacy, with Lord Godolphin, and\r\nthus secured the oil painting from that distinguished friend himself.\r\nThis theory is strengthened by the fact that the picture still bears the\r\ncoat of arms of Lord Godolphin.\r\n\r\nTo reach and secure this picture, or at least a faithful copy of it,\r\nbecame an object of continuous effort that was never intermitted for\r\nmore than twenty years. At last, in the spring of 1877, one of the\r\ncorrespondents of _Wallace’s Monthly_, Prof. M. C. Ellzey, of Blacksburg,\r\nVirginia, wrote me that the picture was then the property of Dr. J. H.\r\nMurray (whose wife was a lineal descendant of Mr. Galloway) of Cedar\r\nPark, adjoining Tulip Hill, West River, Maryland, and that he would have\r\nthe picture sent to me. In a few days it arrived, and when my eyes rested\r\nupon it, it was like the feast of a lifetime; for there was all that\r\ncould ever be known of the greatest horse of his century. The painting\r\nwas in a state of excellent preservation and the coat of arms of Lord\r\nGodolphin was plainly traceable. The horse is shown from his right\r\nside, in his rough, paddock condition, with his right hind foot a little\r\nadvanced, and his head low and without any animation or excitement. The\r\nstandpoint of the artist is a little forward of the shoulders, and he\r\nmust have been a tall man or the horse must have been a low horse, or\r\nperhaps both, for he sees over the horse and portrays the fine spring\r\nof muscle over the loin, on the opposite side of the vertebra. From the\r\nposition of the artist the drawing is slightly foreshortened, and this,\r\ntogether with the advance of his right hind foot, intensifies the droop\r\nof the rump, to some degree, in the outline. From the proportions, as\r\nshown in the painting, I would conclude he was below fourteen and a half\r\nhands high rather than above it. His head is striking and unusually\r\nlarge for an animal of his size, with remarkable width between the\r\neyes, and without a star to lighten it up. His ear is not fine, and it\r\ndroops backward as he stands, as if half-asleep. His mane is sparse and\r\nin disorder. His throat-latch is very good, and the windpipe large and\r\nwell developed. The neck is of a fair length for a horse of his blocky\r\nformation, and there is nothing unusual about it except its great depth\r\nat the collar place. The slope of the shoulder is very marked and shows\r\nhis ability to carry his head in the air when he wished to do so, but the\r\nshoulder itself is coarse and angular to an unusual degree. His withers\r\nrise very abruptly and there is great perpendicular depth through the\r\ncarcass at this point. His back is remarkably short and the spread and\r\narch of his loins is simply magnificent. But the point of superlative\r\nexcellence is in the remarkable development of power in his quarters.\r\nHis limbs, instead of being “spider legs,” are unusually strong for an\r\nanimal of his size; indeed, they might be considered coarse for any horse\r\nthat was pretended to be a race horse. His tail is of the usual weight\r\nand somewhat wavy. With the addition that there is a little white at\r\nthe coronet of the right hind foot, and not forgetting his friend and\r\ncompanion the cat, I have made a somewhat detailed description of what is\r\nrepresented in the painting. Several artists examined the picture, and\r\nthey pronounced it the work of an artist of ability and experience. The\r\nsignature “D. M. pinxt” was carefully examined, but no one was able to\r\nthrow any light upon the name represented by the initial letters “D. M.”\r\n\r\nWhile this painting contained within itself evidence of its great value\r\nas a likeness of its subject, it lacked confirmation as “true to the\r\nlife;” and nothing could supply this lack but to find a portrait of the\r\nsame horse, painted by another artist, and then if the two agreed, the\r\nproof would be fully satisfying to the understanding. A little over a\r\nhundred years ago Lord Francis Godolphin Osborne, Duke of Leeds, and heir\r\nto Lord Godolphin, wrote Sir Charles Bunbury, a great race-horse man,\r\nthat he had a painting of Godolphin Arabian, by Wootton, at Gog Magog\r\nHills. Over sixty years ago an American gentleman wrote to Mr. Skinner’s\r\nmagazine that he had seen a painting of Godolphin Arabian hanging in\r\nHoughton Hall, Norfolk. In 1878 my physician told me I must quit work\r\nfor awhile, and that I had better visit the great Exposition at Paris\r\nthat year. I was anxious to see the Fair, but I was a great deal more\r\nanxious to see those two paintings of Godolphin Arabian, if they were\r\nstill in existence. Gog Magog Hills is a quaint old place, and the origin\r\nand meaning of its name is lost in a very remote antiquity. As it has\r\nnot been the residence of its owners for more than a hundred years, it\r\nis much neglected. The people in charge were very obliging, and I was\r\nimmediately admitted to the view of Wootton’s painting of Godolphin\r\nArabian. The first glance was a complete vindication of the truthfulness\r\nof the Maryland painting as a true likeness in every important feature\r\nof the outline and proportions. The canvas is about four and a half by\r\nfour feet, inclosed in a massive frame. After studying it and comparing\r\nit, point by point for more than an hour, with a copy of the Maryland\r\npainting, it became evident they were not painted by the same hand,\r\nalthough the horse had the same position in both pictures, with the\r\nexception that the right hind foot was thrown backward in the Wootton\r\npainting instead of forward, and thus gave a less abrupt droop of the\r\nrump. The head was precisely the same shape, but in the large painting\r\nthe articulations were less distinct and expressive.\r\n\r\nAfter a little peregrination through Norfolk, studying the “Norfolk\r\nTrotter” as then called, but since called “Hackney,” on his “native\r\nheath,” I reached Houghton Hall, in Norfolk. This grand old place was\r\nbuilt over a hundred and sixty years ago by the famous Sir Robert\r\nWalpole, and at that time it was considered the most splendid structure,\r\nas a gentleman’s country seat, in all England. For many years it has been\r\nthe property of the Marquis of Cholmondeley, but is not often occupied as\r\na residence. Here too, I was lucky, for upon my entrance to the picture\r\ngallery, about the first object upon which my eye rested was the painting\r\nof the Godolphin Arabian, and the first impression was that there must\r\nbe “spooks” around, for that seemed certainly the Maryland picture I was\r\nlooking at. I had it taken down and removed to a good light, and there\r\nthe whole mystery was removed. It is difficult to compare two peas. All\r\nyou can say about them is that they were just alike, and that is all I\r\ncan say about the Galloway picture in Maryland and the Houghton Hall\r\npicture in England. The paintings were the same size, and the pigments\r\nused were of precisely the same shades of color and quality. The colors\r\nwere peculiar in the fact that the artist had used no varnish nor oil\r\nthat would leave a shiny appearance. The Houghton Hall picture had a\r\nblack, glossy margin all around it of about five inches in width on\r\nwhich the names of the most noted of his progeny were inscribed in gold\r\nletters, and at the bottom was this inscription: “The original picture\r\ntaken at The Hills, by D. Murrier, painter to H. R. H. the Duke of\r\nCumberland.” This explained the modest signature attached to the Maryland\r\npicture, which was a replica of the original. “The Hills” is the local\r\ndesignation of “Gog Magog Hills.” The word “original” not only implies\r\nthat the picture was made from life, but that one or more replicas were\r\nmade at the same time.\r\n\r\nHere, then, in this picture, we have all that we know or probably ever\r\nwill know of the origin and pedigree of this horse. It does not tell\r\nus what he was, but it does tell us in the most clear and unmistakable\r\nlanguage what he was not. There is no feature nor element in his make-up\r\nthat does not say that he was neither an Arabian nor a Barb. He was a\r\nstout, strong-boned, heavily muscled, short-legged horse. In his form and\r\nshape he was very far removed from an ideal progenitor of race horses,\r\nbut he was that progenitor all the same. About forty years after his\r\ndeath Mr. Stubbs, who never saw the horse, brought out a painting of\r\nhim which all artists laughed at as the picture of an impossible horse.\r\nThis picture, however, was engraved on steel and became the standard\r\nrepresentation of Godolphin Arabian, in England, till this day. Both\r\nthese pictures are here given, and a comparison of many points makes\r\nit evident that Stubbs copied from the original of Murrier or from the\r\npainting by Wootton, which was probably also a copy of Murrier, and\r\nhe followed his copy just as closely as he could while converting a\r\nbig-boned, stout saddle horse into a long-necked, spindle-shanked race\r\nhorse. By actual measurement the neck is longer than the body, but it is\r\nnot necessary to point out the Stubbs absurdities, as they are apparent\r\nto every eye. It was simply an awkward and dishonest attempt to express\r\nin his form and shape such a pedigree as a great racing sire should have\r\nhad. In these two pictures we have the real and the imaginary—the honest\r\nand the dishonest.\r\n\r\nThe search for this picture and then for its verification was a labor\r\nof many years. I never expected to find the horse’s origin, but the\r\ndiscovery of his likeness seemed to be in the bounds of a possibility\r\nthat was finally realized. Murrier’s picture, as a mere work of art, is\r\nof no mean value. It contains within itself undoubted evidence that it\r\nis a true picture of a horse, and it is shown circumstantially that this\r\nhorse was the great “unknown and untraced founder” of the English race\r\nhorse, with nothing of the race horse in his appearance.\r\n\r\nThe name of this horse has been a misnomer ever since the day he fell\r\ninto the hands of Lord Godolphin, and it has misled a multitude of men\r\nto their financial hurt. Of late years the more intelligent class of\r\nwriters, instead of calling him an “Arabian” call him a “Barb,” but\r\nthere is just as much propriety in using one name as the other, and not\r\na scintilla of authority for using either. Whatever may have been his\r\norigin, his marvelous structural combination of propelling power supplied\r\nwhat was wanting in the English stock of his day, and gave him success.\r\nSince then thousands of Arabians and Barbs have been tried and all of\r\nthem have failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH RACE HORSE (_Continued_).\r\n\r\n    England supplied with horses before the Christian era—Bred\r\n    for different purposes—Markham on the speed of early native\r\n    horses—Duke of Newcastle on Arabians—His choice of blood to\r\n    propagate—Size of early English horses—Difficulties about\r\n    pedigrees in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries—Early\r\n    accumulations very trashy—The Galloways and Irish\r\n    Hobbies—Discrepancies in size—The old saddle stock—The pacers\r\n    wiped out—Partial revision of the English Stud Book.\r\n\r\n\r\nBritain was fully supplied with horses when first invaded by the Romans,\r\nbut as there is no history beyond that period we are only groping in\r\nthe dark when we attempt to discover when or whence this supply was\r\nprocured. The most reasonable theory is that the first supply came\r\nfrom the Phœnician merchants, when they were trading for tin in the\r\nsouthwestern part of Britain. If this theory be correct, the trading\r\nbetween the Phœnicians and the Britons could hardly have been later than\r\nthe fourth century before the Christian era, and it is more probable\r\nthat it was several centuries earlier. This topic, however, has been\r\nconsidered in a preceding chapter. Another theory is that when the tides\r\nof migration struck the Atlantic, in the higher latitudes, there was a\r\nnatural deflection toward the warmer countries of the south, the people\r\ncarrying their horses with them. But from the primitive condition of\r\nthe arts and of maritime affairs among the Norsemen of that very early\r\nperiod, and from the insular position of Britain, it seems to me that to\r\nreach it with horses, the most probable source of supply was from that\r\ngreat nation whose “ships of Tarshish” had been trading to all lands more\r\nthan a thousand years before the Christian era. But, laying all theories\r\naside, there are some facts and dates that we know, and the particular\r\none to which I wish here to call attention is the historical record that\r\nwhen the Romans first visited Britain they found an abundant supply of\r\nhorses; and this was about four hundred years before Arabia received her\r\nsupply from the Emperor Constantius.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the Romans in Britain, horse-racing has been a popular\r\nand favorite amusement of our ancestors, and from that time horses have\r\nbeen bred for special purposes. The “Great Horse,” as he was called, was\r\nbred for war, parade, and show, and was large enough and strong enough\r\nto carry a knight in armor. The smaller horses were bred for the race\r\nor the chase, others for the saddle on account of their easy, gliding\r\nmotion, and the comfort of the rider, while others, again, were stout\r\nof back and limb and able to carry burdens. In regard to the speed\r\nof the horses bred for that purpose, Mr. Gervase Markham, the second\r\nEnglishman who undertook to write a book on the horse, has given us some\r\nvery interesting and valuable information. He brought out his work in\r\nthe latter part of the sixteenth century, and it passed through several\r\n“enlarged and improved” editions. In the edition of 1606 he says:\r\n\r\n    “For swiftness what nation has brought forth the horse which\r\n    excelled the English? When the best Barbaries that ever were\r\n    in their prime, I saw them overcome by a black Hobbie, of\r\n    Salisbury, and yet that black Hobbie was overcome by a horse\r\n    called Valentine, which Valentine neither in hunting nor\r\n    running was ever equalled, yet was a plain English horse, both\r\n    by syre and dam.”\r\n\r\nFrom this we must conclude that some horses from the Barbary States had\r\nbeen brought over previous to 1606, which doubtless antedated the arrival\r\nof King James’ Arabian. This is the horse known as the Markham Arabian,\r\nand is in the above list of foundation stallions. In speaking of the\r\nArabian horses as a breed, the Duke of Newcastle remarks as follows upon\r\nthis particular representative of that breed:\r\n\r\n    “I never saw but one of these horses, which Mr. John Markham, a\r\n    merchant, brought over and said he was a right Arabian. He was\r\n    a bay, but a little horse, and no rarity for shape, for I have\r\n    seen many English horses far finer. Mr. Markham sold him to\r\n    King James for five hundred pounds, and being trained up for a\r\n    course (race), when he came to run every horse beat him.”\r\n\r\nThe duke then goes on to speak of the staying qualities of the Arabians:\r\n\r\n    “They talk they will ride fourscore miles in a day and never\r\n    draw the bridle. When I was young I could have bought a nag for\r\n    ten pounds that would have done as much _very easily_.”\r\n\r\nThese remarks are repeated here because they are specially pertinent in\r\nthis connection.\r\n\r\nIt will be conceded by every one who has any knowledge of the horse\r\nhistory of this period that the Duke of Newcastle was the best-informed\r\nman of his generation on all subjects connected with the history and\r\nbreeding of the horse. His preference for blood was in the following\r\norder: The Barb, the Turk, the Spaniard, the Neapolitan, and the\r\nhandsomest of the English stock. It will be observed that in this\r\nclassification the Arabian has no place.\r\n\r\nFrom these illustrations, to which other similar ones might be added,\r\nit seems to be evident that the native English stock did not lack speed\r\nso much as they lacked quality, finish, and beauty. Perhaps size should\r\nbe included in this enumeration. They had been bred and trained to run\r\nfor centuries, and they were as stout and fleet as the exotics, but they\r\nlacked the qualifications of beauty and style. The foreigners possessed\r\nwhat the natives lacked, and more than all they furnished both the\r\nclimatic and the blood outcross that were needed to re-invigorate the\r\nnative character. It was the custom of the people in the seventeenth\r\ncentury to let their horses of both sexes roam at will through forests\r\nand glades, and in this way the average size had been reduced and the\r\nlaw of Henry VIII. (prohibiting the running at large of stallions under\r\na certain size) had become a nullity. At the time of the restoration of\r\nCharles II. (1660) the average size of the traveling stock of England was\r\nvery small—perhaps not over thirteen hands high—and then commenced the\r\nserious work of increasing the size and improving the speed of the light\r\nhorse stock, under the direction and influence of the Duke of Newcastle.\r\nThe introduction of the new blood would give vigor to the stock, but as\r\nthat blood was the blood of Turks and Barbs, probably but little if any\r\nlarger than the native stock, the mystery still remains unsolved. In\r\nabout one hundred years from that time the average size of the race horse\r\nhad been brought up from less than fourteen to about fifteen hands. This\r\nincrease of size cannot be accounted for on any other grounds than the\r\nintroduction of the blood of some larger breed. We cannot conceive of\r\nthis being the blood of the old Flanders stock that had been brought over\r\ncenturies before; hence I am strongly of the opinion that the duke knew\r\njust what he was doing when he brought in a lot of stallions and mares\r\n(the latter called the “Royal Mares”) without telling anybody what they\r\nwere or where they came from. This view is strengthened by the fact that\r\nnone of the descendants of these mares, for several generations, ever\r\nmade a mark upon the turf. If we reject this theory of the “Royal Mares,”\r\nwe are then forced to the conclusion that the increase of size came\r\nchiefly from the large cold-blooded mares of the native stock. The fleet\r\nrunning families of the natives were small, and the imported Turks and\r\nBarbs were but little if any larger; hence, if we accept the evidence of\r\nour own senses and study the great variations in height, we cannot reject\r\nthe conclusion that these variations had their origin in the size of the\r\noriginal elements entering into the formation of the breed.\r\n\r\nWhat was the extent of the influence of the speed of the old English\r\nrace horse upon the new race horse that sprang up in the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries? This is a question that has not been very much\r\ndiscussed, but every intelligent and thinking man has given it more or\r\nless thought. Britain was not rapid in the progress of civilization and\r\nrefinement, but through all the centuries of her history she had her\r\nrace horses and she ran them. There can be no doubt that many of these\r\nnative horses could outrun and outlast the best of the exotics that were\r\nbrought in. None of those exotics, so far as we know, could run and win.\r\nTheir value, then, was measured, not by what they could do themselves,\r\nbut by what their progeny could do; and that progeny, at the foundation,\r\ncarried half the blood of the old tribes. There were no racing calendars\r\nin the seventeenth century and none till the second decade of the\r\neighteenth, and during all that time the blood of every man’s horse\r\nwould, naturally, be fashionable blood. When the racing calendars were\r\nestablished they were a partial check upon untruthful representations,\r\nbut this check only extended to the sire of the animal, and was then not\r\nalways trustworthy. This left the whole maternal side open to all kinds\r\nof misrepresentation, and as the Anglo-Saxon race is fond of liberty,\r\nevery man exercised the liberty of making his pedigrees to suit himself.\r\nThus, through advertisements, sale papers, etc., great multitudes of\r\nfictitious pedigrees, all shaped on fashionable lines, gained currency\r\nand were propagated from owner to owner, from generation to generation.\r\nOn this point I speak from the personal knowledge of a long lifetime\r\nin connection with such affairs in our own country, and I take it for\r\ngranted that our English ancestors were no better and no worse than we\r\nare ourselves. This was the condition of things in England for about\r\none hundred and fifty years, and when Mr. Weatherby was at work on the\r\nStud Book he was overflowed with a flood of those bald-headed fictions,\r\nconcocted by generations long past, and nobody could disprove them. In\r\nthis way a large portion of the accumulated rubbish of past generations\r\nfound its way into the English Stud Book and there it stands to-day,\r\nserving only to misguide the seeker after truth.\r\n\r\nThe earliest records of English racing commence with the year 1709, and\r\nat Newmarket 1716. There have been several racing calendars published at\r\ndifferent times, but probably the best and most convenient for office use\r\nis the Racing Register published by Bailey Bros., commencing with the\r\nfirst and now filling several large volumes. In the early days very few\r\nof the winners even had any pedigree, but after the lapse of about fifty\r\nyears we find it the rule to insert the sire of all winners, although\r\nthere were still some exceptions. Under this usage it became possible in\r\nthe course of time to establish the leading facts on the paternal side,\r\nand thus the work of the stud-book compiler was greatly facilitated.\r\nThose racing calendars, although intended merely to serve the convenience\r\nof men who bet their money, caring nothing for blood, served the more\r\npermanent and valuable purpose of fixing the paternal lines in the\r\ngenealogy of the English race horse.\r\n\r\nIn 1786 Mr. William Pick, of York, England, published “A Careful\r\nCollection of all the Pedigrees it was then Possible to Obtain,” thus\r\nantedating Mr. Weatherby’s “Introduction” by five years. In 1785 Mr. Pick\r\nhad commenced the publication of a racing calendar called “The Sportsman\r\nand Breeder’s Vade Mecum,” which was continued a good many years. These\r\nlittle annual volumes were well received, and they were the forerunners\r\nof Pick’s Turf Register, the first volume of which was brought out in\r\n1703. This was the same year that the first volume of Weatherby’s Stud\r\nBook appeared, and there was a sharp rivalry between the two authors,\r\nnot merely as two men, but as representing two divisions of the country.\r\nMr. Pick was a Yorkshire man and Mr. Weatherby was a Londoner. Yorkshire\r\nclaimed to be the “race-horse region” of England, and the Southrons were\r\nready to fight rather than concede that claim. This rivalry survived two\r\nor three generations of racing men, and it is a question whether it\r\nhas yet subsided. In the north Pick was the authority and in the south,\r\nWeatherby.\r\n\r\nThese two men worked on different plans, and each had its advantages.\r\nPick limited his labors to the great animals of the past, and took them\r\nup in chronological order, giving a brief sketch of the history and\r\nperformances of each. This plan required space, and when he had completed\r\nhis first volume of five hundred and twenty-eight pages he had only\r\nreached the close of 1763. The second volume, bringing the work down to\r\nthe close of 1772, made its appearance in 1805. Mr. Pick did not live\r\nto continue the work, and it fell into the hands of Mr. R. Johnson, who\r\nbrought out the third volume in 1822, which continued the chronological\r\norder to the close of 1782. After the lapse of forty-five years, namely\r\n1867, the fourth volume appeared under Mr. Johnson’s name, bringing\r\nthe work to the close of 1792, and I am not aware that the work has\r\nbeen continued. These four volumes contained much that cannot be found\r\nelsewhere, and are very valuable.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to study these assemblages of impossible things put together\r\nand called pedigrees, we begin to realize the absolute rottenness of the\r\nalleged pedigrees of that whole early period. Take, for instance, the\r\ncase of the horse called the Bald Galloway. He bore this name because\r\nhe had a bald face, and was of the Galloway breed. This Galloway breed\r\ntook its name from the old Province of Galloway, in the southwestern part\r\nof Scotland. They were small, active horses and were famous for many\r\ngenerations as a breed of pacers. It has been said that the last pacers\r\nin Great Britain were found in Galloway. This horse, Bald Galloway, was\r\nfoaled some time about 1708 and was famous as a fast race horse till he\r\ntrained off at five years old. I think there is no doubt about his being\r\na genuine Galloway, and if so how could he have a pedigree all of foreign\r\nblood and ending in a “Royal Mare?” This Galloway horse was the sire of\r\nthe famous Roxana, that produced Lath and his full brother Cade, that\r\nmade the early reputation of the great Godolphin Arabian. I will ask my\r\nreaders to refer to the Curwen Bay Barb, No. 11, near the commencement of\r\nthis chapter. This was one of the very best of all the Barbs imported,\r\nand his origin and history are given with unusual fullness, as well as\r\nan enumeration of the best of his get. In examining this enumeration it\r\nwill be seen that a good number of his best foals were out of Galloway\r\nmares and are called “Galloways.” Brocklesby Betty was one of the great\r\nmares of her day, and the Stud Book says that “as a runner, she was\r\nthought to be the superior of any horse or mare of her time.” She was\r\nfoaled 1711, was got by Curwen Bay Barb and out of Mr. Leedes’ Hobby\r\nMare. She was a brood mare before she was trained, and her performances\r\nwere soon after the establishment of the Racing Calendars, which show\r\nher great superiority. The “Hobbies” were a breed of Irish pacing horses\r\nthat had been noted for more than a hundred years, on both sides of the\r\nIrish channel, as saddle horses, hunters, and runners. The theory that\r\nthese “Irish Hobbies” were descended from the horses on board one of the\r\nships of the Spanish Armada, that was wrecked on the Irish coast, is\r\npurely fanciful, for they were known as a breed long before the Spanish\r\nArmada was projected. The Hobbies were larger and better formed, as a\r\nrule, than the Galloways, and more highly esteemed. These illustrations\r\nof the influence and power of indigenous blood in the formation of the\r\nbreed, known throughout the world as the English race horse might be\r\nextended indefinitely, but let these suffice. With the “Galloways” and\r\nthe “Hobbies,” well known to our ancestors two hundred years ago as\r\nestablished breeds or tribes of horses, we cannot avoid the conclusion\r\nthat they were very prodigal of fancy and very economical of truth when\r\nthey attempted to clothe Bald Galloway, Leedes’ Hobby, etc., in foreign\r\npedigrees to make them fashionable. Aside from the matters of evidence\r\nhere introduced going to show the composite material entering into the\r\nconstitution, structure and instincts of the race horse as he is today,\r\nthere is another that plays a very prominent part in the combination.\r\nWhen we see a race horse fourteen hands high, and another of equally pure\r\nblood standing beside him seventeen hands high, we naturally wonder, and\r\nask, Why this difference in size? The Turk, the Barb, the Hobby, the\r\nGalloway, and indeed all the old English racing stock, were very small,\r\nscarcely averaging fourteen hands. After we have made every allowance for\r\na salubrious climate and a generous and unstinted dietary we must concede\r\na gradual increase of growth, but these things fail to account for a\r\ndifference of twelve inches in the height of two horses bred in the same\r\nlines for untold generations. The conclusion seems to be inevitable that\r\nthere were big horses as well as little ones in the original combination\r\nof ancestors. From these diverse sources of his inheritance, it becomes\r\nplain to the mind of every one that the English race horse is thoroughly\r\ncomposite in the blood he inherits, and it is beyond the powers of\r\nanalysis to determine whether one element did more than another in making\r\nhim the fastest running horse in the world.\r\n\r\nWhile it might be forcibly, if not conclusively, argued that the native\r\nEnglish horse had in him all the elements necessary to the development of\r\na breed of race horses as great as the breed of our own day, there is one\r\nfact ever present to the senses which goes to show that the influence of\r\nexotic blood was very wide and very powerful in controlling the action of\r\nthe race horse. The popular and prevailing pacing action of the Hobbies,\r\nthe Galloways, and other hunting, racing and saddle tribes was completely\r\nwiped out more than a hundred years ago. Any attempt to account for this\r\nrevolution in the gait of the English horse as a fancy of fashion, or on\r\nthe introduction of wheeled vehicles, fails to satisfy the understanding.\r\nIn the first half of the seventeenth century pacers were popular,\r\ncommon, and abounded everywhere. In the second half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury not one could be found in all Britain, “from Land’s End to John\r\nO’Groat’s House.” Of all the facts that are known and established in the\r\nhistory of the English horse, the wiping out of the pacer is the most\r\nstriking and significant. This exterminating process was not limited\r\nto the families that were intended for hunting or racing purposes, but\r\nextended to all types and breeds of English horses. The little English\r\npacers that had been the favorites of kings and princes and nobles for\r\nso many centuries were submerged in the streams of Saracenic blood\r\nthat flowed in upon them, and their only legitimate descendants left\r\nupon the face of the earth found homes in the American colonies. Their\r\nblood is one of the principal elements in the foundation of the English\r\nrace horse, but the “lateral action” in his progeny was esteemed a\r\nbar-sinister on the escutcheon of the stallion, and it was sought to\r\nbe covered up with something more fashionable in name. The old saddle\r\nhorses of England were not all pacers, although that habit of action was\r\nvery general among them, and in some families it was more uniform and\r\nconfirmed than in others, and my authority for this conclusion will be\r\nfound in the detailed account of the horses brought from England to the\r\nAmerican colonies early in the seventeenth century. It is evident that\r\nfrom the day the blood of the Saracenic horse was brought in contact\r\nwith that of the indigenous saddle horse, they were antagonistic, if\r\nin nothing more, certainly in the habit of action. The one never moved\r\nin the lateral action and the other very generally adopted that form of\r\nprogression because it was his inheritance. What might have been the\r\nresult if left to the laws of “natural selection,” it would be impossible\r\nto decide; but with the dictates of profit to the master, the mandates of\r\nfashion, and above all the accepted teachings of the Duke of Newcastle,\r\nthe little pacer had no “friends at court,” and all he could do was to\r\nget out of the way, with his lateral action. In our own country and\r\nunder the observation of everybody the pacer shows great tenacity to his\r\nlong-inherited habit of action, and although buried in non-pacing blood,\r\nas supposed, for two or three generations, the pace is liable to appear\r\nagain, at any time. So it was, doubtless in English experiences, but as\r\nthe revolution was not retarded by the development of pacing speed, in\r\none hundred years from the restoration, in 1660, there was no longer a\r\npacer on British soil.\r\n\r\nWhen the first Mr. Weatherby assumed the task of making and keeping a\r\nregistry of English race horses, he seems to have had only a very faint\r\nconception of the magnitude of the undertaking. The first volume of his\r\n“General Stud Book” was published in 1803, and when it appeared it was\r\nfound to contain so many things that were not true that the necessary\r\nwork of revision and excision reduced its contents fearfully. In these\r\neliminations he started in with a free hand, as is shown by comparison\r\nwith later editions, but soon found that his book was disappearing very\r\nrapidly, and not much of it would be left, if he did not stay his hand.\r\nAt this point he seems to have adopted some new rule, unfortunately,\r\neither of evidence or of date, probably the latter, for his work\r\ndiscloses the fact that he declined all responsibility for pedigrees\r\nas they came to him, of an earlier period than about 1780. Beyond that\r\ndate nearly all the crude and impossible things of fiction were allowed\r\nto remain and are thus propagated as true, down to our own day. There\r\nwas one rule, however, adopted very early in the management of this\r\ncompilation that saved it from degeneracy, and that was the difficulty\r\nof getting into it. In all its history, from the beginning, it has been\r\na kind of “close corporation,” and the animals in the volume of the last\r\nyear are almost uniformly descended from the animals to be found in the\r\nfirst volume. The application of this rule, no doubt, worked an injustice\r\nin very many cases, but it made the English race horse a BREED,\r\npre-eminent above all other horses for his unequaled speed as a running\r\nhorse. This general rule restricting admissions to the descendants of\r\nsuch as had places in preceding volumes seems to have been followed and\r\nmaintained with a good share of rigidity, by the different generations\r\nof the Weatherby family, in whose hands the compilation still remains.\r\nWhatever may have been the ratio of fables and forgeries in the first\r\nvolume, they were there compacted and neither the Weatherbys nor the\r\nbreeders have been much annoyed with them since. The plan of the Stud\r\nBook itself is very unsatisfactory to the careful student, for the reason\r\nthat it admits of no details of breeder, owner, etc., that are of vital\r\nimportance in tracing and identifying an unknown or disputed pedigree.\r\nWhile the plan is very desirable and effective in placing the produce of\r\nmares underneath the dams, it is very defective in relation to breeders,\r\nand subsequent owners. Unless the identity of the animal can be traced\r\nand established by the records, the pedigree is always doubtful. But\r\nnotwithstanding the unsatisfactory plan of its construction, it has been\r\nhonestly compiled, and we may safely accept its contents, back as far as\r\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century, when Mr. Weatherby began his\r\nwork; but when we reach the period of the eighteenth century, facts,\r\nfables and frauds are so inextricably mixed that whatever we accept must\r\nbe _cum grano salis_. Beyond that period Mr. Weatherby furnishes nothing\r\nbut the wildest fancies and traditions shaped up by those contributing\r\nthem with a view to lengthen a pedigree and a price accordingly. All that\r\nwe can ever know of the horses of that period we must gather from the\r\nlittle snatches dropped by contemporaneous historians.\r\n\r\nIn establishing his “General Stud Book,” Mr. Weatherby’s work may be\r\ncompared to the building of an embankment around a great field which\r\ncontained all the race horses of the realm. They were of all colors, all\r\nmarkings and all sizes, except the monster cart horse and the diminutive\r\nShetland. They had all raced or possessed blood that had raced, and they\r\nall had pedigrees of various lengths and various degrees of reliability.\r\nThey all walked and trotted and galloped, and there was not a pacer among\r\nthem, for the last pacer had disappeared from England probably fifty\r\nyears before this. The antagonism of the Saracenic horse had triumphed,\r\nand that antagonism was bred in the blood and bone of every animal in\r\nthe field. They were placed there to be inter-bred and to produce race\r\nhorses. Every one of the thousand owners was anxious to produce a great\r\nwinner, and he was left to the exercise of his own fancy and judgment as\r\nto what cross would be most likely to prove successful, and to vindicate\r\nhis superior intelligence. With, all experimenting outside of the breed\r\npractically barred, the instincts of the breed ripened and intensified\r\nuntil its representatives are able to beat the fleetest in the world\r\nat the gallop, but they could neither walk fast nor trot fast. It is\r\ndoubtful whether any person in the world has ever seen a true-bred race\r\nhorse that could trot a mile in four minutes. At this gait they show no\r\naptness nor speed whatever. By breeding to fit the modern methods of\r\nracing, the speed of the race horse has been greatly increased, for short\r\ndistances, but his stamina and endurance no longer command admiration as\r\nin former generations.\r\n\r\nIn the latter half of the last century there were a good many excellent\r\ntrotters in England, but the further we get away from the blood of the\r\nold English pacer, the fewer the trotters we find, until at last there\r\nare none at all. It seems to be true of all countries that where there\r\nare no pacers there are no trotters. It was not the purpose nor wish of\r\nthe English people to banish the trotter, but when the pacer was banished\r\nthe trotter soon followed him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN RACE HORSE.\r\n\r\n    Antiquity of American racing—First race course at Hempstead\r\n    Plain, 1665— Racing in Virginia, 1677—Conditions of early\r\n    races—Early so-called Arabian importations—The marvelous\r\n    tradition of Lindsay’s “Arabian”— English race horses first\r\n    imported about 1750—The old colonial stock as a basis—First\r\n    American turf literature—Skinner’s _American Turf Register and\r\n    Sporting Magazine_, 1829—Cadwallader R.

This embraces a century of horse\r\nhistory that, hitherto, has been practically unexplored and unknown.\r\nFor the details of what I have been able to glean of this neglected\r\nand unknown century my readers are referred to the chapters on the\r\ndifferent colonies. The first racing in this country of which we have any\r\nhistorical knowledge was organized by Governor Nicolls. In 1664 the Dutch\r\nsurrendered the province of New Netherlands to the English, and the next\r\nautumn, 1665, the new race course at Hempstead Plains was inaugurated by\r\nthe new governor of the colony. This course was named Newmarket, after\r\nthe famous English course, and Governor Nicolls’ successors continued to\r\noffer purses on this course for many years, and after a time there were\r\ntwo regular meetings held there, spring and autumn. Owing to the distance\r\nof this course from the city, other courses, near at hand, were soon\r\nconstructed and racing of all kinds and at all gaits held high carnival.\r\nThe principal prizes were called “Subscription Purses,” the distance\r\nalmost invariably two miles, and the weight carried ten stone. The horses\r\nthat ran were known as “Dutch horses,” and were descended from the\r\noriginal stock brought from Utrecht, in Holland. They were larger than\r\nthe English horses, and brought better prices, although the latter were\r\nesteemed more highly for their saddle gaits. I think the Dutch horses,\r\noriginally, had no natural pacers among them, but for the pleasures and\r\nuses of the saddle they were inter-bred with the English horses and the\r\nmixed blood soon produced many pacers. It is probable also that this\r\nmixture increased the speed of the whole tribe. Thus racing continued\r\nwith but few interruptions and without any known changes in the rules\r\nor conditions governing performances, except that after fifty years or\r\nmore the weight to be carried was reduced from ten stone to eight stone.\r\nIn the year 1751, which was eighty-six years after Governor Nicolls had\r\nestablished the Newmarket course on Long Island, we find the following\r\nsignificant condition inserted in the terms of entrance to the races, for\r\nthe first time: “Free to any horse, mare, or gelding bred in America.”\r\nThe simple meaning of this new condition was to “head off” the scheme\r\nof some “sharp” fellows who were, probably, then on the ocean with two\r\nor three English race horses, with which they expected to “gobble up”\r\nwhatever stakes or purses came within their reach.\r\n\r\nThe first record we have of racing in Virginia is to be found in the\r\ncourt records of Henrico County, in the year 1677—twelve years after the\r\nestablishment of racing in New York. For fuller particulars of this,\r\nthe reader is referred to the chapter on that colony. The Virginians\r\nwere a horse-racing people from the start, and it is impossible to\r\ntell how long before racing first commenced, but probably just as\r\nsoon as any two neighbors met, each owning a horse, a few hundred\r\npounds of tobacco were put up the next day, to make it interesting, in\r\ndetermining which was the faster. This racing feeling was not confined\r\nto neighbors nor to neighborhoods, but it pervaded the whole colony, and\r\nthe people of every county had their annual and semi-annual meetings,\r\nwhich everybody attended. Their methods of handicapping will strike the\r\npresent generation as somewhat peculiar. In their advertisements of the\r\nmeetings, such language as the following was very common: “Sized horses\r\nto carry one hundred and forty pounds and Galloways to be allowed weight\r\nfor inches.” From this we learn that the tribe of little Scotch pacers\r\nwere still to the fore on this side of the water and that they were\r\njust as fleet as the larger horses, provided the weight was graduated\r\nto their inches. There was one feature in these race meetings that will\r\nbe a surprise to many of my readers, as it was to myself, and that is\r\nthe fact that at most of these meetings there was one four-mile race.\r\nSmaller prizes were run for by horses classed as to size, and it may be\r\nnoted that there was one class “not exceeding thirteen hands.” At these\r\nmeetings the distance never seems to have been less than one mile, while\r\non the southern border of the colony and in North Carolina, quarter\r\nracing was very popular and very common from the earliest dates, and it\r\nwas kept up through the greater part of the eighteenth century. For a\r\nfuller account of the racing of those early days the reader is referred\r\nto the chapter on Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn this old English, Irish and Scottish blood, full of the pacing\r\nelement, which we may now call “native” blood, we have the real\r\nfoundation upon which the English race horse was bred and from which has\r\ncome the approximate if not the complete equal of the highest type of the\r\nEnglish horse, in both speed and stamina. The English and the American\r\nrace horse came from the same source and possess the same blood, with\r\nthis trifling distinction—the native mares in England were bred to horses\r\nof exotic, Saracenic origin, while the native mares of America were bred\r\nto the descendants of that native-exotic combination. Hence, with the\r\noriginal maternal ancestry of the same blood, the combined and improved\r\nEnglish descendant of that blood became the paternal ancestor of the\r\nAmerican race horse. We must not forget that this “paternal ancestor”\r\nhad been the result of crossing and recrossing, selecting, breeding and\r\ndeveloping for nearly a hundred years, and that he was, therefore, a\r\nfar better horse and far more prepotent as a sire than the produce of\r\nthe first cross made under the direction of the Duke of Newcastle. We\r\nmust not ignore the fact that while there were many stallions brought\r\nover in the early days there were also a few mares, but they were so few\r\nin number that their influence was hardly appreciable in the new breed\r\nto be established. Saracenic blood was touched very sparingly in the\r\ncolonial days, as even the names of not more than three or four have\r\nbeen preserved in history. The only one of that period fully identified\r\nwas named Bashaw and was kept on Long Island about the year 1768. Like\r\nall the others, he was called an Arabian, but according to the showing\r\nof his advertisement he was bred by the Emperor of Morocco, and was not\r\nan Arabian. Of the later period and coming down to about 1860 there are\r\ntwenty-five or thirty that have been called “Arabians.” Near the head\r\nof the list stands one called “Arab Barb” or “Black Arabian Barb.” He\r\nwas claimed to be an imported Barb from Algiers, and was seventeen hands\r\nhigh, “and coarse in proportion.” Many other so-called “importers” were\r\nequally absurd and dishonest in their claims, but there horses all passed\r\nas genuine “Arabians.” Out of the whole number called “Arabians” not more\r\nthan five or six seem to have had a shadow of right to the name, and\r\nthese exceptions were practically restricted to the animals imported by\r\nMr. A. Keene Richards, of Kentucky. That each and all of these exceptions\r\nwere irredeemable failures is a fact well known to all intelligent\r\nhorsemen. This motley crew of “Arabian” importations came from all the\r\ncountries bordering on the Mediterranean, except Arabia, were all called\r\n“Arabians,” and they were all flat disappointments both as race horses\r\nand as producers of race horses.\r\n\r\nOut of this list of thirty-five or forty so-called Arabian horses, there\r\nis one that requires special mention, not only because a correction\r\nmay be made in his history, but because I have frequently spoken of\r\nhim as the only Arabian that had left any mark upon the horse stock of\r\nthe country. Lindsay’s Arabian, as he was called, was a grey horse and\r\nrepresented to be over fifteen hands high. The story is that he was a\r\nBarb and had been presented to the commander of a British man-of-war,\r\nwhen a colt, by the ruler of one of the Barbary States, as an expression\r\nof gratitude to the captain for having saved the life of his son. The\r\ncaptain sailed away for a South American port, and while lying there he\r\ntook his present ashore to let him have a little exercise. The colt was\r\ngiven the free range of a lumber-yard, as the story goes, and in his\r\nplayfulness a pile of lumber fell upon him and broke three of his legs.\r\nThe British officer was greatly grieved at his loss and proposed to put\r\nthe colt out of misery by knocking him on the head. There happened to be\r\nan American trading vessel in port and the skipper “allowed if he had\r\nthat critter on his vessel he could save him.” The officer at once gave\r\nhim to the skipper and told him his history. Yankee ingenuity and thrift\r\nsoon got him aboard the trader and he was swung up and his legs properly\r\nbandaged. The surgical treatment was good, the bones knit, and in due\r\ntime the vessel arrived at New London, and the colt was taken to the\r\nvicinity of Hartford. Just where this story originated it is not possible\r\nnow to say, nor do I know that it ever had currency in Connecticut, but\r\nit was certainly rehearsed and probably believed in Maryland. He was\r\nowned by Colonel Wyllis of Hartford, and was advertised in 1770 under the\r\nsingle name of Ranger, and described as “a fine English stallion of the\r\nBarbary breed, bred in England.” From this it would appear that nothing\r\nwas then known of his romantic history. As a part of his Maryland history\r\nit was said that General Washington’s attention had been attracted to\r\na body of Connecticut cavalry by the excellence of their horses, and\r\nat his instance Captain Lindsay bought Ranger, because he was the sire\r\nof many of those horses, and took him to Maryland, where he was ever\r\nafterward known as “Lindsay’s Arabian.” The story of the indorsement\r\nof Washington made an excellent stallion card, and it is not necessary\r\nthat we should inquire into it too closely, for the dates might raise\r\na question. The horse passed from Colonel Wyllis to James Howard, of\r\nWindham, and was advertised by him as “The Imported Arabian Horse called\r\nThe Ranger to stand at his stable the season of 1778.” Hence we must\r\nconclude that he was not taken to the South before the season of 1779,\r\nor possibly later. Then, as now, to catch the popular fancy, North and\r\nSouth, the horse is no longer an “English stallion of the Barbary breed”\r\nbut an “Imported Arabian Horse.” His cross was well esteemed in his\r\nday, and it has held its place in the estimation of all the experienced\r\nhorsemen as a good cross in an old pedigree. We now see that he was bred\r\nin England, that he was got by a Barb horse or the son of a Barb horse,\r\nand that it is not probable there was a single drop of Arabian blood\r\nin his veins. This little sketch will serve to illustrate the methods,\r\ngeneral and particular, that were invariably used to place a fictitious\r\nvalue upon the so-called imported “Arabians.” In no other department of\r\nhuman knowledge has there been such a universal and persistent habit of\r\nmisrepresenting the truth of history as in matters relating to the horse.\r\nIt seems to have been, and still is, a kind of psychical contagion that\r\nhas been generating dishonesty and a habit of lying in the minds of the\r\ngreat body of horsemen for the past two hundred and fifty years. If a\r\nhorse is brought from Turkey, or Syria, or Egypt, or Spain, or Morocco,\r\nor any of the Barbary States, he is at once called an “Arabian.” This\r\nis worse than a misnomer, for it is an essential untruth, and its\r\nuniversal use does not redeem it from its essence of deception and fraud.\r\nIt must be conceded, however, that this deception may have sprung from\r\nbad teaching and ignorance rather than from a depraved moral sense, for\r\nmany people, as well as the poets and the novelists, may have concluded\r\nthat as the nations named above got their religion from Arabia, so\r\nthey got their horse stock from the same country, and thus the horses\r\nbrought from Turkey, or Syria, or Egypt, or Spain, or Morocco, or any\r\nof the Barbary States, are descendants of the Arabian horse and thus\r\nentitled to the name “Arabian.” This seems to be the only theory upon\r\nwhich this universal misrepresentation can be palliated. Let us repeat a\r\nsentence or two here, to show what history reveals on this point. Strabo\r\nsays there were no horses in Arabia at the beginning of the Christian\r\nera. Philostorgius says that in the year 356, two hundred “well-bred”\r\nCappadocian horses were sent as a present to the prince of Yemen, by\r\nthe Emperor Constantius. These were the first horses in Arabia. In the\r\ndays of Mohammed horses were exceedingly scarce in Arabia, and they have\r\nremained so to the present time. The horse is an expensive exotic in\r\nArabia, as he is never used for any domestic purpose, nor for any other\r\npurpose except robbery or display. For all domestic and commercial uses\r\nthe camel is far better. All the countries named above were abundantly\r\nsupplied with horses, at least eight hundred or a thousand years before\r\nthere were any horses in Arabia. The Moslems got their religion from\r\nArabia, but not their horses. This topic is more fully discussed in the\r\nchapter on the Arabian horse.\r\n\r\nThe importation of English race horses to this side of the water\r\ncommenced about the year 1750, and that being the middle of the last\r\ncentury it is easy to remember the date when the line was drawn between\r\nthe old and the new elements appearing on the race course. The following\r\nsix animals were brought over within a year or two of that date—Monkey,\r\nTraveller, Dabster, Childers, Badger, and Janus. A few others might be\r\nnamed, but some at least are mythical. Of those here named, Traveller\r\nwas the great horse. Janus became the progenitor of a tribe of very fast\r\nquarter horses, and although he did not found that tribe, which had been\r\nin existence for a hundred years on the border line between Virginia and\r\nNorth Carolina, he doubtless improved it. Monkey was twenty-two years old\r\nwhen he came and did not live long. The whole number imported into all\r\nthe colonies before the war of the Revolution counts up to about fifty,\r\nand some of these are practically unknown, and a few of them were wholly\r\nfictitious. Maryland, I think, was first in the field of importations,\r\nand then followed Virginia, New York, and North Carolina. Possibly the\r\nvery earliest importations were made in South Carolina, but there is\r\nnot much evidence that those importations were utilized to any extent\r\nfor racing purposes, and hence we know but little of the doings of that\r\ncolony till a later date. There were not more than about twenty mares of\r\nEnglish race-horse blood imported, in the quarter of a century preceding\r\nthe Revolution, into all the colonies. As many of these animals of both\r\nsexes were stolen or destroyed during the war, we can approximate with\r\nsome degree of certainty the great reduction in this producing force by\r\nthe time the war ended and importations again commenced.\r\n\r\nNow, we have before us the old colonial running stock that had been\r\ntested in many a battle and found able to cover the distance of two to\r\nfour miles, and we have also the new running stock that had never been\r\nasked to go any further, but we have no actual, authentic and reliable\r\nknowledge of the comparative speed of the two classes. There were no stop\r\nwatches nor records of time kept in those days. This much only we know,\r\nthat prizes were offered for “half-breds” for a few years, but when it\r\nwas found that some of the half-breds could run just as fast and as far\r\nas some of the whole-breds, this class of prizes was withdrawn. Then\r\ncommenced the manufacture of fraudulent pedigrees, for, it was argued,\r\n“How could an American horse beat an English horse unless he had English\r\nblood and plenty of it?” Hence, when a horse won that fact was taken as\r\nproof that he was full bred, and no time was lost in investing him with\r\na first-class, pure-bred pedigree. This was a little onerous on the few\r\nimported mares that were known and named, as in the case of imported Mary\r\nGray, for she had to _produce_ eleven filly foals by imported Jolly Roger\r\nin order to accommodate her numerous progeny, as alleged, and how many\r\nmore claims were made of the same pedigree it would be very difficult\r\nto estimate. When it began to appear a little awkward to require Mary\r\nGray to have, on paper, more than eleven filly foals by Jolly Roger, it\r\nwas soon, discovered that it was less perplexing and at the same time\r\nless liable to be “cornered” by saying “dam an imported English mare.”\r\nNo doubt there was a great deal of sharp practice, to say nothing of\r\ncheating and lying, about horse matters in Colonial times, but those\r\nlittle venialities were only the blossoms indicating the mature fruits\r\nof deceptions and frauds that were to follow when pedigrees would be\r\nconsidered an element of value in the running horse, and when every man\r\nwould have the power, in fact, to make and print his pedigrees to suit\r\nhimself. This brings us to a very brief consideration of what has been\r\ndone in the direction of correcting the frauds of the past and preventing\r\nthem in the future.\r\n\r\nThe period of fable and of falsehood in the genealogy of the American\r\nrace horse seems to have commenced not long after the first importations\r\nof English race horses. In the first generations from the imported\r\nEnglish horse and the native mare, it was rather difficult for a man\r\nto fix up a pedigree for his half-bred colt that would show him to\r\nbe full bred, but after forty, fifty, or sixty years had elapsed the\r\nevents became misty, and then every man exercised the right to make\r\nhis own pedigrees to suit his own fancy. This seems to have been the\r\ncondition of things for many years, and while there were a few honest\r\nmen who would stick to the truth, the great majority either made their\r\npedigrees to suit themselves or employed some “expert” to make them for\r\nthem. The confusion which ensued was most perplexing, and the slipshod\r\nmanner in which editors and writers on the horse did their work was most\r\ndiscouraging. Whatever was found in print on a crossroads blacksmith shop\r\ndoor was taken as authentic, because it was in print.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 Mr. John S. Skinner, of Baltimore, Maryland, commenced the\r\npublication of a monthly magazine, entitled “_The American Turf Register\r\nand Sporting Magazine_,” and as it really “filled a long-felt want,” it\r\nreceived a very encouraging support. As its name indicated its field,\r\nit at once became the authority on sporting events and the receptacle\r\nof a great amount of valuable correspondence on the horses of the day,\r\nas well as the earlier race horses. Mr. Skinner was industrious in\r\ncollecting material for his magazine, but unfortunately he published\r\nwhatever was sent to him relating to the horse, and just as it was sent.\r\nIf a communication was well written, no difference how many errors of\r\nfact it might contain, it never seemed to occur to Mr. Skinner to use\r\nhis blue pencil. Pedigrees were sent in, amounting to many thousands,\r\nduring his ownership, with fictitious and untruthful remote extensions,\r\nand published without any possibility of tracing the different crosses\r\nto a known or responsible source or name. Here was the opportunity of a\r\nlifetime to “fix up” the pedigrees of stallions to suit the public demand\r\nand the fees sought by their owners, send them to Mr. Skinner, and have\r\nthem duly spread before the public in all their dishonest finery. The\r\nearly volumes are very rich in the accumulations of pedigrees, such as\r\nthey are, and hence very valuable. The magazine received less and less\r\nattention from its proprietor each succeeding year and finally it was\r\ntransferred to the _Spirit of the Times_, of New York, and died after an\r\nexistence of some fifteen years.\r\n\r\nMr. Cadwallader R. Colden, of New York, commenced the publication of\r\nanother sporting magazine, that was of very great merit, and did much to\r\ncorrect some of the errors that abounded in Mr. Skinner’s publication.\r\nIn the controversies which naturally sprang up he had greatly the\r\nadvantage of his adversary, for he knew horse history and Mr. Skinner\r\ndid not. Mr. Colden was a man of marked ability, and over the signature\r\nof “An Old Turfman” he made himself famous as a writer. He hated a fraud\r\nand wherever he saw one he did not hesitate to hit it. His publication\r\nwas a large and expensive one, racing was then under the periodical\r\ninterdict of public opinion, and after about two or three years, and\r\ngreatly to the loss and misfortune of the truths of horse history, the\r\npublication was discontinued. The weekly press had no representative in\r\nthe field of “horse literature and sporting subjects” until early in\r\nthe thirties, when the _Spirit of the Times_ was founded by William T.\r\nPorter. The conception of a weekly paper devoted to all kinds of sports,\r\nsuch as hunting, fishing, racing, gaming, etc., was not only new in this\r\ncountry, but it was brilliant. Mr. Porter was not only a gentleman in his\r\nappearance and manners, but he had fine social qualities and was a writer\r\nof ability and polish. Such a personage would naturally gather about him\r\nfriends and correspondents that were congenial, and very soon _The Spirit\r\nof the Times_ became noted as the organ of a great body of educated men\r\nwho loved sport and enjoyed wit. It was the only publication of its kind\r\non the continent, and it soon obtained a very wide circulation. Mr.\r\nPorter knew very little of horses, either theoretically or practically,\r\nbut he was a ready adapter and wrote some fine descriptions of famous\r\nracing contests. His habits were sportive rather than industrious, hence\r\nhe left nothing behind him of value to his friends or to the world\r\nexcept the mere fact that he was the founder of the first sporting paper\r\nin this country. In course of time the paper with all its belongings\r\nbecame the property of John Richards, the former pressman, and Mr. Porter\r\nhad to look for a living wherever he could find it. Mr. George Wilkes\r\nthen took him under his wing, and started a new sporting paper called\r\n_Porter’s Spirit of the Times_. The use of this name carried with it the\r\nsupport of a good many friends, but as he was not able to write anything,\r\npractically, for the new paper, from its very commencement in September,\r\n1856, it failed to yield any support to Mr. Porter, and not much to Mr.\r\nWilkes and his partners. Litigation arose and Mr. Wilkes finally withdrew\r\nfrom _Porter’s Spirit of the Times_, and started _Wilkes’ Spirit of the\r\nTimes_ in September, 1859. We then had three sporting papers all claiming\r\nto be the original and only legitimate _Spirit of the Times_. Among their\r\nreaders they were distinguished as the _Old Spirit_, _Porter’s Spirit_,\r\nand _Wilkes’ Spirit_. The circulation of the Old Spirit was largely in\r\nthe Southern States, and the war destroyed it, in 1861. _Porter’s Spirit_\r\nhaving but little money and still less brains, died about the same time.\r\nThis left Mr. Wilkes in open possession of the field, and his remarkably\r\ntrenchant articles on the conduct of the war gave _Wilkes’ Spirit of\r\nthe Times_ a very wide circulation, even among those who cared nothing\r\nfor sporting matters. At the same time he was fortunate in securing the\r\nservices of Mr. Charles J. Foster, an able writer on horse subjects, and\r\na very industrious and capable man in managing and discussing affairs\r\nconnected with the horse. Some years later, Mr. Wilkes dropped his\r\nown name from the title of his paper, and not long afterward he added\r\ntwenty-five or thirty years to its age by changing the numbers so as to\r\ncover the period of the original _Spirit of the Times_ founded by William\r\nT. Porter. The old sporting publications, one and all, maintained the\r\nview, so far as they ever had any view to maintain, that all that was\r\nof any value in the American horse, for whatever purpose, had come down\r\nto us from the Arabian through the English race horse. Their value,\r\ntherefore, consists wholly in the naked statistics which they contain.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt made in this country, in the direction of publishing\r\na stud book of American race horses, was the product of Patrick Nesbitt\r\nEdgar, an eccentric and apparently not well-balanced Irishman, who was\r\na resident of North Carolina. This book, which purported to be a “first”\r\nvolume, was very remarkable in many respects, two or three of which I\r\nwill enumerate. The prevailing absence of dates and all means by which\r\nthe truth or falsity of a pedigree could be determined; the astounding\r\nnumber of crosses given, even to the _immediate_ descendants of imported\r\nsires; the multitude of animals never heard of before nor since, with\r\npedigrees extended a dozen crosses; the absence of many animals that\r\neverybody had heard of. This book had been in print about thirty years\r\nbefore I ever saw it, and the first impression it made on my mind was\r\nthat the author was “clean daft.” At the same time, through all his work\r\nthere was a “method in his madness,” going to show the care he had taken\r\nto exclude or suppress any little fact that might lead to detection and\r\nexposure. As an illustration of his methods I will take the following\r\npedigree, at random, as given by him and copied, literally, by Mr. Bruce,\r\nfollowing the particular form of the latter:\r\n\r\n    CENTAUR, b. h. foaled 1767, bred by ——; owned in Virginia, got\r\n    by imported Stirling (Evans’) (foaled 1762).\r\n\r\n    1st dam by imp. Aristotle (imported 1764).\r\n\r\n    2d dam by imp. Dotterel.\r\n\r\n    3d dam by imp. David (imported 1763).\r\n\r\n    4th dam by imp. Ranter (imported 1762).\r\n\r\n    5th dam by imp. Othello (imported 1755).\r\n\r\n    6th dam by imp. Childers (imported 1761).\r\n\r\n    7th dam an imported, thoroughbred mare.\r\n\r\nNow, what do we know about this pedigree that has been indorsed and\r\npublished, just as here stated, by two stud-book makers? They do not\r\npretend to know by whom he was bred, nor do they know in what part of\r\nVirginia he was owned, but they assume to know perfectly well each cross\r\nin his pedigree and that his seventh dam was an imported, thoroughbred\r\nmare. The dates of importations in parentheses in the foregoing have\r\nbeen placed there by myself for the sake of the exhibit. The horse\r\nDotterel, the original of that name and by the same reputed sire, never\r\nleft England, and it is probable this Dotterel is mythical. Now, let us\r\nanalyze this pedigree by the aid of the searchlight of dates. Ranter,\r\nimported 1762, might have had a filly to his credit in 1763. This filly\r\nat two years old might have been bred to David and produced a filly in\r\n1766. This filly at two years old might have been bred to Dotterel and\r\nproduced a filly in 1769. This filly at two years old might have been\r\nbred to Aristotle and produced a filly in 1772. This filly, at two years\r\nold, might have bred to Evans’ Stirling (or Starling), and produced the\r\ncolt Centaur in 1775—_but he was foaled in 1767_. Not once in a million\r\ntimes would this succession of possibilities occur, but if they did occur\r\nin this case the pedigree of Centaur still remains absolutely impossible,\r\nfor four generations of horses cannot be crowded into five years. This\r\nexhibit fairly illustrates the character of Mr. Edgar’s work, and being\r\nright on the border line between the “native” race horse and the modern\r\n“thoroughbred” we see just how they compressed the breeding of eight\r\ngenerations into the space of fifteen or sixteen years. If we were to\r\ncompare the English with the American methods of manufacturing pedigrees,\r\nit would be hard to determine which was the more shamefully dishonest.\r\nMr. Edgar was fiercely dissatisfied with the indifference of horsemen to\r\nhis enterprise, and with the lack of support which they rendered him. He\r\nwent forward with his second volume and professed to have completed it,\r\nbut announced that it should never be put in type until the horsemen of\r\nthe country should assist and support him. In the event of their failing\r\nto do so he threatened to sink his manuscript twenty feet deep in the\r\ncenter of the Dismal Swamp, where no mortal would ever find it. The\r\nsecond volume never appeared, and it is to be hoped he carried out his\r\nthreat.\r\n\r\nFor the second attempt at compiling a stud book of American Race Horses\r\nI must, myself, plead guilty. Some time in the “fifties” I came into\r\npossession of a number of volumes of the “old” _Spirit of the Times_,\r\nSkinner’s American Turf Register, three or four volumes of the “English\r\nStud Book” and a large number of volumes of the _English Sporting\r\nMagazine_. As I was then dabbling slightly around the edges of “horse\r\nliterature,” I found this little nucleus of a library very convenient,\r\nbut very unsatisfactory in answering questions that came to me, and\r\nwhich an official position seemed to require that I should be able to\r\nanswer. When asked for the pedigrees of other domestic animals I could\r\ntake down the Herd Books of the different leading breeds and give precise\r\ninformation, but when asked about the pedigree of a horse, unless he was\r\ngreatly distinguished as a racer, days of solid labor might be expended\r\non the one question and then not discover the information sought. It\r\nwas, perhaps, ten years after this time before I ever saw or heard of\r\nthe misbegotten and foolish compilation of pedigrees made by Edgar. For\r\nsome years this labor of compilation was prosecuted at odd hours, for\r\nmy own personal use and satisfaction, and without the remotest purpose\r\nof ever publishing a stud book. As I plodded my way along, finding what\r\nI supposed to be a fact here and another there, and often conflicting,\r\nI found myself invariably accepting what was longest as a pedigree,\r\nas this feature seemed to be evidence not only of completeness, but\r\nof truthfulness at the same time. As my gleanings grew in volume my\r\ninterest in what I was doing became more absorbing and intense, and when\r\nI had completed the search of every page and paragraph of my published\r\nsources of information, up to the close of the year 1839, I found I had\r\nenough matter for a large volume. About this time I came into possession\r\nof a copy of “Edgar’s Stud Book”—and I was greatly perplexed to know\r\nwhat to do with it. The copyright was dead and it contained a good many\r\nunimportant and utterly unknown things that I had not met with in all my\r\ngleanings. Under these circumstances and considering the fact that it\r\nabounded in the crudest uncertainties, to call them by no harsher name,\r\nI concluded to use his work in all cases where I did not have a pedigree\r\nfrom other sources, to cut off all imaginary extensions and to insert his\r\nname, in every case, as the source of information and responsibility. The\r\nwork then went to press and the first volume of “Wallace’s American Stud\r\nBook” made its appearance in 1871. The time and labor expended on the\r\nfirst volume made me quite familiar with the leading performers of the\r\nseveral generations embraced therein, and the work on the second volume\r\nwent forward with more ease and rapidity, and in 1871 I had completed the\r\ngleaning of all publications relating to the race horse, up to the close\r\nof 1870.\r\n\r\nThis second volume, being about the size of the first, was completed and\r\nput in due form for the compositor, but never was published. The reason\r\nwhy it was never published may not be without interest to the student\r\nof horse genealogy, and I will, in a few words, state that reason.\r\nSide by side with the progress of the second volume of the runners,\r\nI was carrying forward a careful investigation of the lineage of the\r\nearly trotters and their progenitors. As there were no trotting records\r\ngiving pedigrees, I was compelled to go back to the breeders as the only\r\nsource of reliable information. When I obtained this from intelligent\r\nand reputable people I accepted the information and stood by it as the\r\ntruth; and when I came to compare it with the representations of pedigree\r\nmade in advertisements of some stallion scion of the family, the truth\r\nbegan to dawn upon me that advertisements, whether in newspapers or on\r\ncrossroads blacksmith-shop doors, with scarcely an exception, were made\r\nup of statements that were utterly false and fictitious. They were made\r\nup for the single purpose of securing patronage, and generally traced\r\nin different directions to famous and well-known horses. The fictitious\r\nextensions of stallion advertisements have served as the basis for the\r\nfictitious extensions of families and tribes. When I came to compare\r\nthe extensions of trotting pedigrees with running pedigrees, I could\r\nnot discover that the one was any more or less reliable than the other.\r\nThey rested on precisely the same basis of stallion pedigrees, and no\r\ndifference whether they appeared in Mr. Skinner’s _Turf Register_ or in\r\na big poster, there was no censorship, and they were both in type—and\r\nwhatever was in type was generally supposed to be worthy of belief. In\r\none respect the pedigrees of running horses are more reliable than the\r\nearly advertisements of trotting horses, particularly with those that\r\nraced, for they were required to give the sire and dam when they were\r\nentered in races, and a failure to comply with this rule was penalized.\r\nThe sires, therefore, are generally right, but unfortunately the rule did\r\nnot require the dam to be named and definitely specified, hence any one\r\nof a dozen unnamed mares by a given horse could be represented in after\r\nyears as the dam of that particular horse. Here commenced the trouble\r\nin the unnamed and untraced mares that never have been nor ever can be\r\nidentified. On a careful and sorrowful review of my work of many years I\r\nfound that I had been working on a wrong basis from the start. Instead of\r\ndiscovering and arranging a great many valuable truths, as I supposed,\r\nI had devoted years to perpetuating thousands and thousands of fictions\r\nin these unknown, unnamed, and unidentified dams. This is the reason the\r\nsecond volume of “Wallace’s American Stud Book” never was published.\r\nThe only benefit I ever derived from the work was in its educational\r\naspects. The work made me familiar with the early running-horse history\r\nof this country and of England, and taught me what so many horsemen\r\nshould learn—that a truth is always better than a lie. The more carefully\r\nand thoroughly I went into the origin, lineage and history of what we\r\nmay call the modern race horse, the more evident it became to my mind\r\nthat the great mass of the running horses of our own generation are\r\ncarrying, in their pedigrees, the frauds and fictions of the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries, to say nothing of the innumerable deceptions\r\nand tricks of our own century. To accept and propagate these untruths is\r\nsimply to, in a manner, indorse them, and an attempt to eliminate them\r\nwould invoke the clamors of a continent. Hence, more than twenty years\r\nago, I washed my hands of all responsibility for the pedigrees of English\r\nrace horses, and turned my attention to establishing the lineage of the\r\nAmerican trotter, on sure foundations, and building him up into a breed.\r\n\r\nThe third attempt at compiling the pedigrees of running-bred horses was\r\nmade by Mr. Sanders D. Bruce, of New York, and as it followed Edgar and\r\nWallace, it was made up chiefly of what he found in these works. The\r\nconscienceless fictions of Edgar were accepted without hesitation or\r\nremorse, and the central aim seemed to be to make every pedigree as long\r\nas possible, whether true or false. No fictitious stallion advertisement\r\nwas ever too absurd to serve as a basis for the pedigrees of all his\r\nkindred. Mr. Bruce accepted everything and rejected nothing, and it is\r\nnot probable he ever investigated a pedigree in his life. His rule of\r\naction seems to have been to please his customers, and to scrupulously\r\navoid all public discussions of pedigrees. This was the politic course to\r\npursue, for any attempt to defend the monstrosities it contained would\r\nhave wiped it out of existence very quickly. Bruce’s Stud Book seems to\r\nhave been supported by a few individuals, from the beginning, as a kind\r\nof eleemosynary institution, and it is not likely it will ever rise above\r\nthat condition.\r\n\r\nThe substantial correctness of the generations extending back for a\r\nperiod of sixty or eighty years, and in some cases even a little further,\r\nis a very valuable contribution to our store of knowledge in this\r\ndepartment of industry, but, unfortunately, the generations beyond those\r\nthat may be classed as recent very largely rest upon foundations that are\r\nfictitious and fraudulent.\r\n\r\nThese fictions and frauds are so general and common in the remote\r\nextensions on the female side of the pedigree that when we find a\r\nstring of ten or perhaps twenty dams and not one of them named, known\r\nor identified until we strike the twenty-first, and she described as\r\n“thoroughbred, imported mare,” we know that this is the work of the\r\nprofessional “pedigree maker,” and not more than once in a hundred times\r\nwill we be mistaken. This is alike true of both English and American\r\npedigrees of race horses. The modern crosses are comparatively honest,\r\nbut the remote extensions, through the maternal lines, in both countries\r\nare chiefly the products of a venal imagination.\r\n\r\nThere are some foundation truths in the history and development of the\r\nEnglish and American race horse—for they are both one in blood—to which\r\nI must briefly advert before dismissing this topic. In announcing the\r\nconclusions which I have reached, I am fully conscious that I will come\r\nin contact with preconceived opinions that have been very prevalent, if\r\nnot universal, for at least two centuries.\r\n\r\n1. There were race horses in England that had been racing and breeding\r\nfor centuries before the first Saracenic horse was brought there, and\r\nit was not an uncommon thing for the native to beat the exotic, when he\r\nfirst arrived. There had been racing in America, by what we will call the\r\nnative stock—but they were all English and Dutch—for about one hundred\r\nyears before the first English race horse reached this country.\r\n\r\n2. These horses had been selected with care and bred for centuries with\r\nmore or less intelligence, with the single purpose of increasing their\r\nspeed. During those centuries there were not so many writers on biology,\r\nheredity, etc., as we have now, but the old aphorism, “Like begets\r\nlike”—a complete epitome of all science on this subject—was just as well\r\nknown and as universally believed a thousand years ago as it is to-day.\r\nWe may, therefore, safely conclude that at the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury there were many native English horses, descended from lines and\r\ntribes that had been selected, raced and bred for generations, that were\r\nfully the equals of the best of the exotics, that were brought in about\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\n3. The native stock of England at the close of the sixteenth century, was\r\nthe stock from which the American colonies received their first supplies,\r\nexcept the few brought from Utrecht, in Holland, to the Dutch Colonists\r\nin New York. When brought across the Atlantic, especially in Virginia, no\r\ntime was lost in continuing their development as race horses, which was\r\ncarried forward for nearly one hundred years before the first English\r\nrace horse was imported for their improvement. Their regular racing was\r\nat all distances, up to four miles.\r\n\r\n4. On this basis of the native English blood, common to both countries,\r\nthe breed of English and American race horses was built up. The foreign\r\nelements brought into England were chiefly from the Barbary States and\r\nfrom Turkey. This exotic blood certainly had a very marked effect upon\r\nthe horse stock of Britain, but it cannot be said, with certainty, that\r\nit increased the speed of the race horse. All the experiences of the past\r\nhundred years with these foreign strains have gone to show that instead\r\nof increasing the speed they have retarded it.\r\n\r\n5. The list of the foundation stock of the English race horse as given\r\nby Mr. Weatherby, in the first volume of the English Stud Book, and\r\nreproduced in the preceding chapter, is worthy of very careful study,\r\nespecially by those who seem to think that the English race horse is\r\ndescended, without admixture, from the Arabian horse. The striking\r\nfeature of that list is the overwhelming preponderance of other blood\r\nthan the Arabian, even if we accept all that is called Arabian as\r\ngenuine. Mr. Darley’s horse, called an Arabian, and Lord Godolphin’s\r\nhorse, called an Arabian, count for more than all the others put\r\ntogether, in the make-up of the English race horse. Mr. Darley’s horse\r\ncame from a region remote from Arabia and where a thousand good horses\r\nare bred for one in Arabia, and should be called a Turk. Lord Godolphin’s\r\nhorse—“the great unknown”—will ever remain unknown. He seems to have been\r\ntraced to France, and, after studying his portraiture, it is probable he\r\nwas a French horse.\r\n\r\n6. Taking this list of foundation stock and viewing it from the\r\nstandpoint of the greatest lenity and liberality that a sound and careful\r\njudgment can accord, we find that the inheritance of Arabian blood in the\r\nveins of the English race horse, if there was any such inheritance at\r\nall, was strictly infinitesimal. This historical fact in the foundation\r\nof the race horse, showing the inutility of Arabian blood, whether\r\ngenuine or spurious, has been fully confirmed in great multitudes of\r\ntrials, in both nations, during the past hundred years. In no case has it\r\nbeen a benefit, but always a detriment.\r\n\r\n7. The race horse has been bred through centuries for the single purpose\r\nof speed. Through all his generations he has been the product of the\r\nbrains, judgment and skill of his successive masters. Parents were\r\nselected that could go out and win the prizes from their fellows. The\r\nnext generation was not only the product of running parents, but parents\r\nthat were from running families. Thus grew up the pedigree of the\r\nrace horse under the direction of thought and judgment. Pedigrees are\r\npractical things and full of winners, and in no sense made more valuable\r\nby having some supposed “Arabian” cross away back ten generations, that\r\nnever ran in his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL HORSE HISTORY—VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n    Hardships of the colonists—First importations of horses—Racing\r\n    prevalent in the seventeenth century—Exportation and then\r\n    importations prohibited—Organized horse racing commenced 1677\r\n    and became very general—In 1704 there were many wild horses\r\n    in Virginia and they were hunted as game—The Chincoteague\r\n    ponies accounted for—Jones on life in Virginia, 1720—Fast\r\n    early pacers, Galloways and Irish Hobbies—English race horses\r\n    imported—Moreton’s Traveler probably the first—Quarter racing\r\n    prevailed on the Carolina border—Average size and habits of\r\n    action clearly established—The native pacer thrown in the shade\r\n    by the imported runner—An Englishman’s prejudices.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colony of Virginia, settled at Jamestown, May 13, 1607, was subjected\r\nto a succession of dissensions, privations and disasters extending\r\nthrough a number of years. The elements of which this first plantation\r\nwas composed were heterogeneous, and many of them wholly unsuited to\r\nbattle with the hardships and privations of the wilderness. A very large\r\nproportion of the adventurers were mere idlers at home, descended from\r\ngood but impecunious families, and had never done an honest day’s work in\r\ntheir lives. Too proud to labor even if they had known how, hunger and\r\nrags soon made them the most unhappy and discontented of mortals. The\r\ngovernmental affairs of the colony fell into confusion, like the people\r\nforming it, and we have no official record of what was done for a number\r\nof years. All that is known today of what transpired in the early years\r\nof the colony has been gleaned from the personal correspondence of actors\r\nin the many strifes that came so near destroying them all. These letters\r\nare, generally, so strongly imbued with partisan feeling that there seems\r\nto be no room left to tell us anything about the industrial growth of the\r\ncolony, either in planting or breeding. The excerpts, therefore, relating\r\nto the early horses of Virginia which I have been able to gather from a\r\ngreat many sources, will fall far short of being complete, but I think\r\nthey will serve as a basis upon which to form an intelligent estimate of\r\nthe Virginia horses of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and as\r\nto the nineteenth, the newspapers will furnish everything what is needed.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the fleet of three vessels which took out to Virginia\r\nthe first adventurers took also some horses and mares with them; for\r\nthe governor and council, who went out the next year, in reporting the\r\ncondition of the colonists to the home company, under date of July 7,\r\n1610, use this language:\r\n\r\n    “Our people, together with the Indians, had, the last winter,\r\n    destroyed and killed up all our hogs, inasmuch as of five or\r\n    six hundred, as it is supposed, there was not above one sow\r\n    that we can hear of left alive, not a hen or a chick in the\r\n    fort, and our horses and mares they had eaten with the first.”\r\n\r\nFrom a letter written by M. Gabriel Archer, who arrived in Virginia\r\nAugust 31, 1609, we gather the following facts:\r\n\r\n    “From Woolwich, the fifteenth day of May, 1609, seven sail\r\n    weighed anchor and came to Plymouth the twentieth day, where\r\n    George Somers, with two small vessels, consorted with us. There\r\n    we took into The Blessing, being the ship wherein I went, six\r\n    mares and two horses, and the fleet layed in some necessaries\r\n    belonging to the action; in which business we spent time till\r\n    the 2d of June, and then set sail to sea, but crossed by South\r\n    West winds, we put into Falmouth, and there stayed until the\r\n    8th of June, then gate out.”\r\n\r\nNow, as The Blessing was probably about the average size of the rest of\r\nthe fleet, I think it is reasonable to conclude that each of the other\r\nvessels took some horses also. In a report of a voyage to Virginia, dated\r\nNovember 13, 1611, we find the following statement: “They have brought to\r\nthis colony one hundred cows, two hundred pigs, one hundred goats, and\r\nseventeen horses and mares.” In 1614 the Virginians made a raid on Port\r\nRoyal, in what was then called New France, and carried off to Virginia,\r\namong other captures, a number of horses, mares and colts. A second raid\r\nin the same quarter seems to have resulted in carrying off wheat, horses,\r\nclothing, working tools, etc.\r\n\r\nMr. Harmor, writing in 1614, in his “True Discourse on the Present State\r\nof Virginia,” says: “The colony is already furnished with two hundred\r\nneat cattle, infinite hogs in herds all over the woods, some mares,\r\nhorses and colts, poultry, great store, etc.”\r\n\r\nIn 1894, in the Public Records Office in London, I found that the\r\nVirginia Company had sent out four mares, February, 1619, on The Falcon.\r\nAnd further, I found a kind of summary of what the company had done in\r\nthe past toward populating and supplying the colonists with live stock.\r\nIt is stated that they had sent twelve ships, taking out one thousand\r\ntwo hundred and sixty-one persons, making the total number in Virginia\r\nat that date about two thousand four hundred. The exportations include\r\nfive hundred cattle, with some horses and goats, and an infinite number\r\nof swine. In 1620 the company ordered twenty mares to be sent over, at\r\na cost, delivered, of fifteen pounds each. From the price of horses in\r\nEngland at that day, I would infer that somebody was making money out of\r\nthe colonists.\r\n\r\nIn a little work published in London, 1646, entitled “A Perfect\r\nDescription of Virginia,” the author says that “There are in Virginia,\r\nof an excellent raise (race), about two hundred horses and mares.” It\r\nis evident that this statement is a mere estimate, and I am disposed to\r\nthink it a very wild estimate from what follows in a very few years. It\r\nis true that horses do not propagate and increase as fast as any other\r\nvariety of domestic animals, but under the circumstances every effort\r\nwould be made to increase the stock, and from what follows, I think my\r\ncriticism will be sustained.\r\n\r\nIn the legislation of the colony we find no mention of horses, till the\r\nyear 1657, when the exportation of mares was prohibited. Eleven years\r\nafter this (1668) this restriction was removed and the exportation\r\nof both mares and horses permitted. The very next year, 1669, the\r\nimportation of more horses was prohibited by legislative enactment. From\r\nthis it would seem that there were already too many horses in the colony,\r\nor possibly some horse breeder had begun to realize that there were\r\nbetter horses in some of the other colonies that were finding a market in\r\nVirginia, and they thus sought “protection” for their own stock.\r\n\r\nThis prohibition could not have been aimed at the mother country,\r\nfor the prices obtained would not justify the cost and risk of a sea\r\nvoyage. We must, therefore, conclude that it was intended to shut out\r\nthe New England colonies, which were already shipping horses to all\r\nthe settlements on the seaboard, as well as to some of the West India\r\nIslands. In this we see at what an early date commenced the interchange\r\nof commodities among the colonies. As early as 1647 the Dutch authorities\r\nat New Amsterdam authorized Isaac Allerton to sell twenty or twenty-five\r\nhorses to Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe court records of Henrico County, Virginia, for the year 1677 contain\r\nthree distinct trials growing out of horse races for that year. In one\r\ncase the contest was for three hundred pounds of tobacco; in another\r\nthe winner was to take both horses; in the third the amount at issue\r\ndoes not appear. From the readiness at sharp practice and from the\r\ncunning dodges to get clear of paying a bet it is very evident that the\r\nprincipals and the witnesses were well up in all the tricks of racing\r\nas it was practiced at that early day. How long before 1677 racing was\r\npracticed in Virginia I have no means of determining, but the next year\r\nand the next, continuing to the end of that century, the records of the\r\ncourt speak for themselves. In these trials I find the names of Thomas\r\nJefferson, Jr., grandfather of President Jefferson, and also the name of\r\nBenjamin Harrison, the ancestor of two presidents, although they were not\r\nprincipals in any of the cases.\r\n\r\nIn Beverley’s History of Virginia, published in London, 1705, at section\r\nninety-four, we have the following:\r\n\r\n    “There is yet another kind of sport, which the young people\r\n    take great delight in, and that is the hunting of wild horses;\r\n    which they pursue, sometimes with dogs and sometimes without.\r\n    You must know they have many horses foaled in the woods of the\r\n    uplands, that never were in hand and are as shy as any savage\r\n    creature. These having no mark upon them belong to him that\r\n    first takes him. However, the captor commonly purchases these\r\n    horses very dear, by spoiling better in the pursuit, in which\r\n    case he has little to make himself amends, besides the pleasure\r\n    of the chase. And very often this is all he has for it, for the\r\n    wild horses are so swift that ’tis difficult to catch them; and\r\n    when they are taken ’tis odds but their grease is melted, or\r\n    else being old they are so sullen that they can’t be tamed.”\r\n\r\nIn the number of _Wallace’s Monthly_ for September, 1877, p. 684, will\r\nbe found a very interesting article from the pen of the late Dr. Elwood\r\nHarvey, on “The Chincoteague Ponies,” that have from time immemorial\r\noccupied, in a wild state, the islands of Chincoteague and Assoteague off\r\nthe eastern shore of Virginia and Maryland. The traditions relating to\r\ntheir origin are very hazy and improbable, and the most reasonable one,\r\nbecause it is within the range of possibilities, is that a Spanish ship\r\nwas wrecked off this part of the coast and the original ponies were on\r\nboard and swam ashore. It is well established that they have occupied\r\nthe islands for more than a hundred years. They are about thirteen hands\r\nhigh, uniform in shape and resemble each other except in color, for all\r\ncolors prevail. Some of them pace a little, and they have rather light\r\nmanes and tails, and no superabundance of hair on the fetlocks. Now, the\r\nhorses of Virginia, at the period of which Mr. Beverley writes, and\r\nof which I will have something further to say as we progress, were but\r\nlittle if any larger than these semi-wild inhabitants of the islands;\r\nthey were of all colors and many of them paced. As it is well known that\r\nthe action of the ocean, so unaccountable to all human ken, one year\r\nbuilds up a dike connecting islands with the mainland, and the next year,\r\nperhaps, washes it out again, we can thus easily understand how a herd of\r\nthese semi-wild animals may have been caught and kept there. In this way,\r\nit seems to me, the origin of the Chincoteague ponies may be easily and\r\nrationally accounted for, without any shadow of violence to the clearest\r\nreasoning. Mr. Hugh Jones, who, in many directions, seems to have been\r\na closer observer of the life of the colonists than any of the other\r\ntourists whose writings we have examined, wrote a little work entitled\r\n“The Present State of Virginia,” which was published in London, 1724,\r\nexpressing himself as follows, on page 48:\r\n\r\n    “The common planters, leading easy lives, don’t much admire\r\n    labor or any manly exercise except horse-racing, nor diversion\r\n    except cock-fighting, in which some greatly delight. This\r\n    easy way of living, and the heat of the summers, make some\r\n    very lazy, who are then said to be climate struck. The saddle\r\n    horses, although not very large, are hardy, strong, and fleet;\r\n    and will pace naturally and pleasantly at a prodigious rate.\r\n    They are such lovers of riding that almost every ordinary\r\n    person keeps a horse, and I have known some spend the morning\r\n    in ranging several miles in the woods to find and catch their\r\n    horses only to ride two or three miles to church, to the\r\n    courthouse or to a horse race, where they generally appoint to\r\n    meet on business, and are more certain of finding those they\r\n    want to speak or deal with than at their home.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jones here places us in close contact with the character and\r\nhabits of the people of that day, as well as with the character and\r\nqualifications of their horses. It is not to be inferred, I think, that\r\nall their horses were pacers, but that all their saddle horses were\r\npacers there can be little doubt. This is the first intimation we have\r\nfrom Virginia that some of their pacers were very fast, and when Mr.\r\nJones says “they could pace naturally and pleasantly at a prodigious\r\nrate,” he means that the speed was marvelous, wonderful, astonishing.\r\nThis “prodigious rate,” in a good measure, balances Dr. McSparran’s\r\naccount of the Narragansett, which he had seen go a mile “in a little\r\nover two minutes and a good deal less than three,” and gives strength\r\nto the statement of Mr. Lewis, that when a boy he had ridden in pacing\r\nmatches and return matches between the Rhode Islanders and the Virginians.\r\n\r\nIn the _Virginia Gazette_, under date of January 11, 1739, we find the\r\nfollowing advertisement, to which we invite special attention, as it\r\nbrings out some facts which, inferentially, throw a great deal of light\r\nupon horse racing, up to that period:\r\n\r\n    “This is to give notice that there will be run for at Mr.\r\n    Joseph Seawall’s, in Gloucester County, on the first Tuesday in\r\n    April next, a Purse of Thirty Pistoles, by any horse, mare or\r\n    gelding; all sized horses to carry 140 lbs. and Galloways to\r\n    be allowed weight for inches, to pay one Pistole entrance, if\r\n    a subscriber, and two if not, and the entrance money to go to\r\n    the second horse, etc. And on the day following, on the same\r\n    course, there will be a Saddle, Bridle and Housing, of five\r\n    pounds value, to be run for by any horse, mare or gelding that\r\n    never won a prize of that value, four miles, before. Each horse\r\n    to pay five shillings entrance and that to go to the horse that\r\n    comes in second. And on the day following there is to be run\r\n    for, by horses not exceeding thirteen hands, a hunting saddle,\r\n    bridle and whip. Each horse to pay two shillings and sixpence\r\n    at entrance, to be given to the horse that comes in second.\r\n    Happy is he that can get the highest rider.”\r\n\r\nThe first point suggested by this advertisement is that there were no\r\ndistinctions made except by size, and that, at this date, 1739, there\r\nwere no English race horses then in Virginia. The second point is that\r\nthere was such a thing as “horse size” but what size this was I have\r\nnot been able to discover. The third point is that Galloways were\r\nallowed weight for inches. They were evidently below “horse size.” But\r\nthey were expected to enter for the big purse of the meeting, and they\r\nmust, therefore, have ranked as good race horses; but what did they\r\nmean by “Galloway?” This is the only instance in which I have met the\r\nterm in Virginian history, although it is well known in general horse\r\nlore. “Galloway” is an old name of a territorial division of Scotland,\r\nembracing Wigtonshire, part of Ayrshire, etc., in the southwestern\r\npart of that country, and was at one time famous for the excellence of\r\nits pacers, and it is probable they were to be found there after the\r\ninflux of eastern blood had driven the pacer from all other portions of\r\nGreat Britain. The Irish Hobbie, always undersized, was a famous race\r\nhorse, as well as a pacer, many generations before the period now under\r\nconsideration. The name “Galloway” is only known in history and is not\r\nto be found on any modern map. I have learned by many experiences that\r\nthe name is very generally believed to be Irish and is confounded with\r\n“Galway,” an Irish county. It is known that an Irish gentleman shipped\r\nmany cattle to the colony, and it is quite possible that he shipped\r\nhorses also, and if this reasoning be right, these “Galloways” may have\r\nbeen Irish “Hobbies.” It will be observed, also, that the distance to be\r\nrun is not definitely stated, but it is fairly to be concluded that the\r\nrace of the second day was to be four miles, and none of them less than\r\none mile, and that in heats. Races of four-mile heats were very common\r\nlong before the first English race horse was imported.\r\n\r\nWe here have a stock of horses that the people of Virginia have bred and\r\nridden and raced for a hundred years, and we know comparatively nothing\r\nabout them. They seem to have been specially adapted to the saddle, but\r\nthey could run four miles, or they could run a quarter of a mile, like an\r\narrow from a bow. They were not a breed, although selecting and crossing\r\nand interbreeding for a hundred years would make them quite homogeneous.\r\nThere is a romantic interest attaching to these little horses, for we\r\nhave reached the middle of the eighteenth century, and all the successive\r\nidols of this race-loving people are about to be dethroned by their own\r\nact, and their homage transferred to a stranger—a larger and finer animal\r\nand faster over a distance of ground. Whatever of glory and honor, to say\r\nnothing of money, that was to be achieved from this time forward was to\r\nbe ascribed to the newly arrived English race horse. But the truth should\r\nnot be concealed that this old stock furnished half the foundation, in\r\na vast majority of cases, for the triumphs of future generations of the\r\nVirginia race horse, and the same may be said of the old English stock\r\nupon which the eastern blood was engrafted. About the middle of the\r\neighteenth century the line was drawn, and there was thereafter developed\r\nthe engrafting of the new upon the old. In 1751-52, Moreton’s imported\r\nTraveller was there, and he was the only English race horse advertised\r\nthat year. There may have been two or three others, but they had not made\r\nthemselves known to the public, and I very much doubt whether there was\r\nany other. A very few years later there were many others, and some of\r\nthem of great celebrity.\r\n\r\nMr. J. F. D. Smith made an extended tour of the colonies, especially\r\nof Virginia, before the Revolutionary war, and he suffered some of the\r\ninconveniences growing out of the rising hostility to the mother country.\r\nIn speaking of quarter racing, he says:\r\n\r\n    “In the southern part of the colony and in North Carolina,\r\n    they are much attached to Quarter Racing, which is always a\r\n    match between two horses to run one quarter of a mile, straight\r\n    out, being merely an exertion of speed; and they have a breed\r\n    that perform it with astonishing velocity, beating every other\r\n    for that distance with great ease, but they have no bottom.\r\n    However, I am confident that there is not a horse in England,\r\n    nor perhaps in the whole world, that can excel them in rapid\r\n    speed; and these likewise make excellent saddle horses for the\r\n    road.”\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that Mr. Smith speaks of these heavily muscled\r\nhorses as a _breed_, which expression, I suppose, is intended to be used\r\nin a restricted sense. In the many generations of horses that would\r\nnecessarily succeed each other in a century, in the hands of a people\r\nso devotedly fond of racing, it is merely an exercise of common sense,\r\namong barbarous as well as civilized people all over the world, to “breed\r\nto the winner.” In this way, and without any infusion of outside blood,\r\nthere would be improvement in the strength and fleetness of all animals\r\nbred for the quarter path. He remarks further that “these likewise make\r\nexcellent saddle horses for the road.” In that day nothing was accepted\r\nas a “saddle horse” that could not take the pacing gait and its various\r\nmodifications. This was true of Virginians of that day, and it is still\r\ntrue of their descendants who have built up new States further west.\r\n\r\nIn the early days, as already intimated, it was the habit of Virginians\r\nto brand their horses and then turn out all not in daily use to “hustle”\r\nfor their own living. As a matter of course these animals would often\r\nstray long distances away, and not a few never were found. In due time,\r\nlegislation provided for the recovery of estrays, embracing all kinds\r\nof domestic animals as well as negro slaves. Fortunately this enables\r\nme to reach what may be considered “original data,” in determining the\r\nsize and habits of action of the early Virginian horses. As the field\r\nof my examination, I have taken the _Virginia Gazette_, for the years\r\n1751 and 1752, published at Williamsburgh, and in these volumes I find\r\na great many advertisements of “Strayed or Stolen” animals scattered\r\nthrough the pages; and in the second especially a great many “Taken Up”\r\nadvertisements appear. In a very large proportion of these notices,\r\nperhaps a majority of them, all the description that is given is the\r\ncolor, sex and brand, with occasionally some natural mark. As a matter\r\nof course these are of no value for the object in view. In some cases\r\nthe size is given without the gait, and in others the gait is given\r\nwithout the size, in a few both size and gait are given. The range of\r\nsize is from one of fifteen hands down to one of twelve hands, with more\r\nof thirteen hands than any other size, either above or below. The true\r\naverage of the whole number is a little over thirteen hands and one inch,\r\nand none of them are called ponies. As further evidence of the small size\r\nof the colonial Virginia horses we find that in 1686 the legislature of\r\nVirginia passed an act providing for the forfeiture of all stallions\r\nunder thirteen and a half hands high found running at large. It provided\r\nthat any person might take up such stallion and carry him before a\r\njustice of the peace, and if he measured less than thirteen and a half\r\nhands, the justice was required to certify to the measurement and the\r\nfacts, and the horse passed legally to his new owner.\r\n\r\nAs to the gaits I find just twice as many pacers as trotters.\r\nDouble-gaited animals, of which there were a few, I have here classed\r\nwith the pacers. That many of these little fellows were very stout and\r\ntough is fully demonstrated by the fact that they could run heats of\r\nfour miles with a hundred and forty pounds on their backs. This closes\r\nthe first epoch in the history of the Virginia horse. The fleet and\r\ncompact little horse of thirteen to fourteen hands had had his day, and\r\nhe was now about to be overshadowed by a greater in speed and a greater\r\nin stature. Much of the blood of the little fellow that could run four\r\nmiles and pace “at a prodigious rate,” was commingled with the blood of\r\nthe English race horse, but whatever its triumphs, the lately arrived\r\n“foreigner” took the credit. A man would have been pronounced “clean\r\ndaft” if at that time he had dreamed that one hundred and forty years\r\nlater the blood of this little pacer would stand at the head of the great\r\ntrotting interest of the world. The tough little fellow has retained his\r\nqualities through all the generations in which he has been neglected,\r\ndespised and forgotten, until he was taken up twenty odd years ago, and\r\nnow the names and achievements of the great pacers are as familiar to\r\nthe whole American people as ever were the name of the greatest running\r\nhorses. It is not known how long he continued to be a factor in the\r\nracing affairs of Virginia, but probably not later than about 1760.\r\n\r\nFrom about 1750 to 1770 seems to have been a period of great prosperity\r\nin Virginia and, notwithstanding the general improvidence of the times,\r\nmany of the large landholders and planters were getting rich from their\r\nfine crops of tobacco and their negroes. This prosperity manifested\r\nitself strongly in the direction of the popular sport of horse racing\r\nand improving the size, quality, and fleetness of the running horse.\r\nEngland had then been selecting, importing Eastern blood, and “breeding\r\nto the winner” for a hundred years, with more or less intelligence and\r\nsuccess, while the colonists had rested content with the descendants of\r\nthe first importations from the mother country. Doubtless progress had\r\nbeen made here too, but it was as the progress of a poor man against\r\nanother with great wealth and backed by the encouragements of royalty.\r\nThe English horse could then run clear away from the Saracenic horse, his\r\nso-called progenitor, and he was very much larger than that “progenitor.”\r\nWe can understand how the speed might be increased by its development in\r\na series of generations and by always breeding to the fastest, but the\r\nincrease of size can hardly be accounted for as the result of climatic\r\ncauses—but we are getting away from the thought before us. When the\r\nVirginia planter found he had a handsome balance in London, subject\r\nto his draft, he at once ordered his factor to send him over the best\r\nracing stallion he could find. The action of one planter stirred up\r\nhalf a dozen others who felt they could not afford to be behind in the\r\nmatter of improvement, but more especially that they could not afford\r\nto be behind in the finish at the fall and spring race meetings of the\r\nfuture. These importations went on continuously for about twelve years,\r\nand until they were interrupted by the excited relations and feelings\r\nbetween the colonies and the mother country and the preparations for the\r\nWar of the Revolution, which was then imminent. After the close of the\r\nRevolution a perfect avalanche of race horses was poured upon us, some of\r\nwhich were good, but a great majority of them were never heard of after\r\ntheir arrival, on the race course or elsewhere. But up to the close of\r\nthe century they had not succeeded in exterminating the pacer—the saddle\r\nhorse of a hundred generations.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of how absurdly a man can talk and even write on subjects\r\nof which he knows nothing, I cannot refrain from giving the following\r\nfrom what an Englishman had to say in 1796 about the horses and\r\nhorsemanship of Virginia:\r\n\r\n    “The horses in common use in Virginia are all of a light\r\n    description, chiefly adapted for the saddle; some of them are\r\n    handsome, but are for the most part spoiled by the false gaits\r\n    which they are taught. The Virginians are wretched horsemen,\r\n    as indeed are all the Americans I have met with, excepting\r\n    some few in the neighborhood of New York. They ride with their\r\n    toes just under the horse’s nose, and their stirrup straps left\r\n    extremely long, and the saddle being put three or four inches\r\n    on the mane. As for the management of the reins, it is what\r\n    they have no conception of. A trot is odious to them, and they\r\n    express the utmost astonishment at a person who can like that\r\n    uneasy gait, as they call it. The favorite gaits which all\r\n    their horses are taught are a pace and a _wrack_. In the first\r\n    the animal moves his two feet on one side at the same time\r\n    and gets on with a sort of a shuffling motion, being unable\r\n    to spring from the ground on these two feet, as in a trot. We\r\n    should call this an unnatural gait, as none of our horses would\r\n    ever move in that manner without a rider; but the Americans\r\n    insist upon it that it is otherwise, because many of their\r\n    colts pace as soon as born. These kind of horses are called\r\n    “natural pacers” and it is a matter of the utmost difficulty to\r\n    make them move in any other manner. But it is not one horse in\r\n    five hundred that would pace without being taught.”\r\n\r\nThere can hardly be a doubt that our English friend in his “Travels\r\nThrough the States” noted and wrote down just what he thought he saw,\r\nand when he saw anything that he never had seen in England, he was\r\nready to either deny its existence altogether or to insist that there\r\nwas some mistake about it. Poor man, he could not understand how there\r\ncould be anything outside of England that could not be found in England.\r\nHis vision, mental and physical, seems to have been restricted to the\r\nshores of his own island home, and he was probably a descendant of a\r\nvery good man we once heard of. As you sail up the Firth of Clyde you\r\npass an island of three or four miles in extent, called Cumbrae. At\r\nthe head of ecclesiastical affairs in the island was a very pious man,\r\nsome generations back, and every Sunday morning he prayed that the Lord\r\nwould bless the “kingdom of Cumbrae and the adjacent islands of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland.” The author of “Travels Through the States” was\r\nevidently one of the very numerous descendants of this good man, as\r\nthey are scattered all over England, and as I am a strong believer in\r\nthe laws of heredity, I can hardly avoid this conclusion. Indeed, some\r\nof the numerous tribe, tracing their genealogy through many generations\r\nback to “The kingdom of Cumbrae,” have found their way across the water,\r\nand at another place I will pay my respects to them. But to return to\r\nour traveler: there can be no doubt about his never having seen a pacer\r\nin England, for the last one had disappeared before his day, unless an\r\noccasional one might have been found in the old province of Galloway, in\r\nthe southern part of Scotland. If he had known the history of the horses\r\nof his own country he would have known that from the time of King John\r\ndown to that of James I., the pacer was the most popular and fashionable\r\nhorse in England, and that the nobility and gentry used no other kind\r\nfor the saddle. He was always of “a mean stature,” but he was compact,\r\nhardy and strong, and could carry his burden a long journey in a day with\r\ngreat ease and comfort to his rider. In the reign of Elizabeth, he was\r\nkept separate from others, and bred as a breed on account of his easy,\r\ngliding motion, which he transmitted to his progeny. At the time of the\r\nplantation of the English colonies in this country the pacers were very\r\nnumerous, and as they were just the type of horse suited to wilderness\r\nlife, a very large proportion of those selected were pacers. The pacers\r\nour traveler saw in Virginia were the lineal descendants of the original\r\nEnglish stock brought over by the adventurers, and the awkward riding\r\ncharged upon the Virginians, with some evident exaggerations, was wisely\r\nand sensibly adapted to the action of the horses they were riding. The\r\ncriticism of the long stirrups is wholly unjust, as they are just the\r\nright length for the “military” seat, and nobody in this country when\r\nmounted on a _real saddle horse_ would ever think of taking any other.\r\nThe Englishman, when mounted on his “bonesetter,” is compelled to have\r\nhis stirrups short so that he can rise and fall with every revolution the\r\nhorse makes on the trot to save himself from being shaken to death. This\r\nup and down, up and down, tilt-hammer seat, if it can be called “a seat”\r\nat all, is one of the most ungraceful things, especially for a lady, that\r\ncan be conceived of in all the displays of good and bad equestrianism.\r\nThe English have been compelled to adopt it because they have no trained\r\nsaddle horses, and a lot of brainless imitators about our American cities\r\nhave followed them because “it is English, you know.” If the English had\r\npacers and horses trained to the “saddle gaits,” they never would have\r\nanything else, and the tilt-hammer “seat” would disappear from Rotten Row\r\nand everywhere else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL HORSE HISTORY—NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n    Settlement of New Amsterdam—Horses from Curaçoa—Prices of\r\n    Dutch and English horses—Van der Donck’s description and size\r\n    of horses—Horses to be branded—Stallions under fourteen hands\r\n    not to run at large—Esopus horse—Surrender to the English,\r\n    1664—First organized racing—Dutch horses capable of improvement\r\n    in speed—First advertised Subscription Plate—First restriction,\r\n    contestants must “be bred in America”—Great racing and heavy\r\n    betting—First importations of English running horses—Half-breds\r\n    to the front—True foundation of American pedigrees—Half bushel\r\n    of dollars on a side—Resolutions of the Continental Congress\r\n    against racing—Withdrawal of Mr. James De Lancey—Pacing and\r\n    trotting contests everywhere—Rip Van Dam’s horse and his cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor several years after Henry Hudson, an Englishman in the employ of\r\nthe Dutch, discovered the harbor of New York and the great river which\r\ntook his name, in the year 1609, there is uncertainty and doubt as to\r\nthe nature of the settlement. For a time it seems to have been merely a\r\ntrading post, occupied only by those in the employment of the company\r\nthat owned it, and without many of the elements requisite to make up\r\na permanent colony. At Fort Orange (Albany) and at Esopus (Kingston),\r\nthe conditions were the same as at New Amsterdam, as New York was then\r\nnamed. The first party of immigrants that seemed to have the elements of\r\npermanent colonization about it arrived in 1625, and consisted of six\r\nfamilies and several single men, making in all forty-five persons, with\r\nfurniture, utensils, etc., and one hundred and three head of cattle.\r\nDoubtless some of these “cattle” were horses, and the general instead\r\nof the specific term was used in enumerating them. Very little is known\r\nof the early horse history of the New Netherlands, as the whole region\r\nwas then named; there can be no doubt, however, that they increased and\r\nmultiplied. Sometime, probably about 1643, a cargo or two of horses were\r\nbrought up from Curaçoa and Azuba, in the Dutch West Indies, but the\r\nclimatic change was too great for them, and they did not do well, being\r\nspecially subject to diseases from which the Dutch horses seemed to have\r\ncomplete immunity. In 1647, Isaac Allerton, as agent, was authorized to\r\nsell twenty or twenty-five of these horses to Virginia, and whether the\r\nauthorities were able thus to get clear of a bad investment does not\r\nappear from the existing records. In a report to the home company, made\r\nin 1650, I find the following prices were given at that time: A young\r\nmare with second foal, one hundred and fifty florins; stallion, four or\r\nfive years old, one hundred and thirty florins; milch cow, one hundred\r\nflorins. The same report makes a comparison by giving the prices of\r\nNew England horses, as follows: A good mare one hundred to one hundred\r\nand twenty florins; stallion, one hundred florins; milch cow, sixty to\r\nseventy florins. Neither horses nor cows were then allowed to be shipped\r\nout of the province without permission of the council.\r\n\r\nAdrien Van der Donck wrote a description of New Netherlands which was\r\npublished 1656, in which he speaks of the horse stock as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The horses are of the proper breed for husbandry, having been\r\n    brought from Utrecht for that purpose; and this stock has not\r\n    diminished in size or quality. There are also horses of the\r\n    English breed which are lighter, not so good for agricultural\r\n    use, but fit for the saddle. These do not cost as much as the\r\n    Netherlands breed and are easily obtained.”\r\n\r\nFrom a large number of facts collected for the years 1777 and 1778 the\r\nhorses then averaged about fourteen hands and one inch, and when compared\r\nwith earlier data it is evident they had increased in height. In the\r\ngaits of those advertised, fifteen both paced and trotted, nine trotted\r\nonly, and seven paced only. As this was in the period of the Revolution,\r\nand right in the center of hostilities, some allowance should be made for\r\nhorses from other colonies.\r\n\r\nThe people of this colony, like those of all the others, branded their\r\nhorses and turned them out to seek their own living in the summer season,\r\nand this resulted in many losses, and oftentimes in much bad feeling.\r\nThe Dutch were not accustomed, in the “old country,” to building fences\r\naround their crops high enough and strong enough to keep out all the\r\ndroves and herds of animals running at large. In the line of improvement\r\nand increase of size in their horses, they provided that all stallions\r\nrunning at large, of two years and nine months old, must be fourteen\r\nhands high or be castrated. This law was in force in 1734, and no doubt\r\nwas effective. Among the many laws for the suppression of vice of\r\ndifferent kinds, I find one prohibiting horse racing on Sunday, and from\r\nthis we might infer that it was not forbidden on other days of the week.\r\n\r\nIn old newspapers, advertisements, etc., we sometimes come across “Esopus\r\nHorses, Esopus Mares,” and, for years, I was not able to tell what this\r\nterm meant. The locality of Kingston was originally called Esopus, and in\r\nthat neighborhood there were several farmers who bred horses largely, at\r\nan early day in the history of the colony, and the locality became famous\r\nfor the character and quality of the horses produced there. They were of\r\nthe best and purest Dutch blood, and for what we would call “all-purpose\r\nhorses” their fame was very wide in that day. Hence I infer that the term\r\n“Esopus” was used to indicate what was considered the best type of Dutch\r\nhorses. There is danger of going astray in the meaning of the term “Dutch\r\nhorses,” as in later times it was applied to the great, massive draft\r\nhorses of Pennsylvania. They were better “for agricultural purposes,” as\r\nVan der Donck puts it, than the Connecticut horses, because they were\r\nlarger and stronger, but they were sprightly and active and some of them\r\ncould run very well. They had a fine reputation in the adjoining colonies.\r\n\r\nNew Amsterdam, and consequently all the plantations in New Netherlands,\r\nsurrendered to Colonel Nicolls, commanding the British forces, August\r\n27, 1664. Colonel Nicolls remained as governor of the colony three or\r\nfour years and until he was succeeded by Governor Lovelace. Among his\r\nearly official acts, Governor Nicolls laid out a race course on Hempstead\r\nPlains, and named it Newmarket, after the famous course in England.\r\nNo engineering or grading was necessary, as nature had already made a\r\nperfect course without stick or stone or other obstruction. The first\r\nrace was run 1665, and although it was a long distance from the city,\r\nthe presence of the governor gave the occasion prestige and there was a\r\ngreat gathering of the gentry from town, and the farmers of Long Island.\r\nThese meetings were kept up annually by the appointment of succeeding\r\ngovernors, and after a time they were held twice a year, spring and\r\nfall. There are some very important facts about these races that are not\r\nknown and probably never will be known, namely, who were the nominators\r\nand what breed of horses were entered in these contests. With these\r\ntwo essential facts left out the value of the information is greatly\r\nimpaired. As it is known, however, that there were but two breeds or\r\ntypes of horses that could have been engaged in these contests, it\r\nbecomes a matter of interest to reach a conclusion as to which were the\r\nvictors. Mr. John Austin Stevens has done some very excellent work on\r\nthis part of the horse history of New York, but I cannot agree with him\r\nin his characterization of the Dutch horses as being Flemish. They did\r\nnot come from Flanders, but from Utrecht. They were not great unwieldy\r\nbrutes, such as we would associate with Flanders, but hardy, compact\r\nanimals that could make their way in the wilderness. Although larger,\r\nit does not follow that they could not run as fast or even faster than\r\nthe New England ponies. All breeds of horses were very much smaller\r\ntwo hundred years ago than they are now. These races were instituted,\r\nevidently, for the improvement of the breed of horses in the colony, and\r\nthe great majority of these horses were the descendants of the original\r\nstock brought from Utrecht. We must, therefore, conclude that they were\r\nnot slow, heavy, unwieldy animals with no action, as the language of Mr.\r\nStevens would seem to imply, but capable of improvement in the direction\r\nof speed. No doubt there were very many New England horses in the colony,\r\n“lighter and better adapted to the saddle,” but neither the interests nor\r\nthe pride of the old Dutch settlers would have permitted them to support\r\nracing for a period of more than eighty years, unless the early Utrecht\r\nblood was represented. Besides this, the weights carried, one hundred and\r\nforty pounds, and the distance, generally two-mile heats, were conditions\r\nthat were strongly against the New Englanders, even if they were lighter\r\nof foot. With these two breeds in the field, we may accept it as an\r\ninevitable sequence that the superior qualities of the one would very\r\nsoon be engrafted on the other, and by this process of breeding, a better\r\ntype would be produced than either of the originals. This first step was\r\nonly a prelude to the next, and that again to the next, until the common,\r\nplain lesson was thoroughly learned, that if a running horse was wanted\r\nthe way to get him was to breed to a running horse that had proved he\r\nwas a running horse. The improvement became very wide and general, and\r\noccasionally an animal was produced with such phenomenal speed that he\r\nwas barred from stakes and purses. On this foundation, and this alone,\r\nthe running turf was built up and continued for about eighty years, with\r\noccasional intervals, when the gamblers made it so nasty that no decent\r\npeople would go near it.\r\n\r\nThe first subscription plate race of which we have any trace is to be\r\nfound in the _New York Gazette_, of September 27, 1736, of which the\r\nadvertisement is given below. The course indicated is believed to have\r\nbeen on the Church Farm, west of Broadway, and not far from where the\r\nAstor House now stands. There is no account of what horses won, and all\r\nwe know is just what is in the advertisement.\r\n\r\n    “On Wednesday, the 13th of October next, will be run for, on\r\n    the course at New York, a plate of twenty pounds’ value, by any\r\n    horse, mare or gelding, carrying ten stone (saddle and bridle\r\n    included), the best of three heats, two miles each heat. Horses\r\n    intended to run for the plate are to be entered the day before\r\n    the race, with Francis Child, on Fresh Water Hill, paying a\r\n    half pistole each, or at the post on the day of running, paying\r\n    a pistole. And the next day being the 14th, will be run for,\r\n    on the same course, by all or any of the horses that started\r\n    for the twenty-pound plate (the winning horse excepted) the\r\n    entrance money, on the conditions above. Proper judges will be\r\n    named to determine any disputes that may arise. All persons on\r\n    horseback or in chairs, coming into the field (the subscribers\r\n    and winning horse only excepted) are to pay sixpence each to\r\n    the owner of the grounds.”\r\n\r\nPassing on to 1747 we find a duplication of the foregoing for the plate\r\nrace of that year, with some variations. Entries are restricted to\r\nanimals that never won a plate before “on this island,” and a horse\r\nnamed Parrot is not permitted to compete. This race was advertised\r\nto take place on the Church Farm. The next that I will notice is the\r\nadvertisement of this same stake for 1751, when the weight was reduced to\r\neight stone, and in addition to the usual exclusion of previous winners,\r\nwe have for the first time a restriction of the entries to animals “_bred\r\nin America_.” At the May meeting at Hempstead Plains, the year following,\r\n1752, the entries are again restricted to animals “bred in America.”\r\nFrom this, then, we are able to fix the precise period when English Race\r\nHorses were first brought to this colony. At this time there were two or\r\nthree other courses on Manhattan Island, besides several noted speeding\r\ngrounds on the roads and elsewhere, for the trotters and the pacers, of\r\nwhich no advertisements appear, and consequently no notice was taken by\r\nthe newspaper press.\r\n\r\nFrom about 1760 up to the time when the Revolutionary struggle began\r\nto engross and absorb all thought and all action, racing received a\r\ntremendous impetus, not only in this colony but in others. Ten or twelve\r\nyears before this a very few rich men in Maryland, Virginia and South\r\nCarolina commenced importing English running-bred horses with great\r\nsuccess, and Mr. James De Lancey and other rich men of this colony were\r\nonly a year or two behind them. This fancy grew and spread until a\r\ngreat many breeders and planters of the richer class had imported stock\r\nof their own, while their less wealthy neighbors were well supplied\r\nwith half-breds. These half-breds were, for a short time, classed by\r\nthemselves and purses were offered and run for, restricted to this class.\r\nAfter experimenting with animals bred in this way it was found that not\r\na few of them were able to hold their own in any company. Mr. Morris’\r\nmare Strumpet was only half-bred, but she was able to beat many of the\r\nimported animals, as well as the full-breds that started against her.\r\nFrom this it would appear that breeding for speed for a hundred years had\r\nproduced results in this country as well as in England. These experiments\r\nled many owners of old-fashioned stock to try it, and right there is\r\nwhere thousands and thousands of our best old American pedigrees end.\r\nThe decade from 1750 to 1760 witnessed a complete transformation from\r\nthe old methods to the new, from the old blood to the new, and more than\r\nall from the old managers to the new. During the next decade, from 1760\r\nto 1770, the new blood came out in great strength, and the saturnalia of\r\nhorse racing grew more and more furious. Purses of a hundred dollars, as\r\nin the olden time, sprang up to ten times that sum, and matches were made\r\nfor sums that were fabulous in that day. One match, between Mr. Delaney\r\nof Maryland and Mr. De Lancey of New York, specified the consideration on\r\neach side as a half bushel of silver Mexican dollars, and the Marylander\r\nhad the satisfaction of carrying home a bushel of silver dollars. The\r\ngreat struggle, in New York, for supremacy on the turf was between the De\r\nLancey family and the Morris family. These two families had been bitter\r\npolitical rivals for years, and when they met on the turf it was for\r\n“blood.” The De Lanceys were Tories and the Morrises were Whigs, and this\r\nintensified the feeling that had so long existed between them. When the\r\nContinental Congress adopted that remarkable resolution, advising the\r\npeople to abstain from horse racing, cock fighting, gambling and some\r\nother more slight offenses, on the grounds of “economy,” in view of the\r\napproaching conflict with the mother country, the effect was thrilling\r\nand electrical. Every man who loved his home and his country obeyed it.\r\nTrue, as I have said, it was drawn in the form of advice and in the\r\ninterests of “economy,” but there was but one great evil, one great\r\nprodigality at which it was aimed, and that was the gambling connected\r\nwith horse racing. It was well aimed and struck the bull’s eye. It came\r\nin the midst of preparations for the greatest race meetings ever then\r\nprojected, but everything was dropped and there it lay through all the\r\nyears of the bloody struggle and until peace again smiled upon a land\r\nof free men. Before avowed hostilities commenced, Mr. James De Lancey,\r\none of the first and largest importers and breeders of his day, sold out\r\nevery animal of the horse kind that he possessed and retired to England.\r\nThus, as the colonial period drew to its close, the brave little colonial\r\nhorse that had weathered the storms of a hundred winters and carried his\r\nmaster in safety and comfort through all that time, is superseded by\r\nanother race, and no one has ever attempted to write even so much as his\r\nepitaph.\r\n\r\nAs the contests of speed considered, up to this point, have all been\r\nat the running gait, I must not close my review of this colony without\r\ngiving some attention to the pacers and the trotters. At these gaits\r\nall sources of information are almost hopelessly barren of facts and\r\nincidents. We know that the running horses of the colonial period were\r\nthe saddle horses of the country, and we know that the best and most\r\nfashionable saddle horses were pacers. When we connect these two facts\r\nand place them alongside of the pacing and trotting experiences of\r\nPennsylvania and New Jersey, we have no difficulty in reaching the safe\r\nconclusion that the same conditions would produce the same results as\r\nin those two States. Pacing and trotting contests were just as frequent\r\nand as exciting in this colony as in any other, but they were sustained\r\nchiefly by road-house keepers and butchers, and were never advertised.\r\nMatches were made one hour and decided on the road in the next. In the\r\n“Annals of New York,” compiled and published in 1832, by John F. Watson,\r\nwe find the following curious, but very valuable, scrap of horse history:\r\n\r\n    “Some twenty or thirty years before the Revolution, the steeds\r\n    most prized for the saddle were pacers, since so odious deemed.\r\n    To this end the breed was propagated with much care. The\r\n    Narragansett pacers of Rhode Island were in such repute that\r\n    they were sent for, at much trouble and expense, by some few\r\n    who were choice in their selections. It may amuse the present\r\n    generation to peruse the history of one such horse, spoken of\r\n    in the letter of Rip Van Dam of New York, in the year of 1711,\r\n    which I have seen. He states the fact of the trouble he had\r\n    taken to procure him such a horse. He was shipped from Rhode\r\n    Island in a sloop, from which he jumped overboard when under\r\n    sail, and swam ashore to his former home. Having been brought\r\n    back he arrived in New York, in thirteen days’ passage, much\r\n    reduced in flesh and spirit. He cost thirty-two pounds and his\r\n    freight fifty shillings. This writer, Rip Van Dam, was a great\r\n    personage, he having been president of the Council in 1731, and\r\n    on the death of Governor Montgomery that year, he was governor,\r\n    ex-officio, of New York. His mural monument is now to be seen\r\n    in St. Paul’s Church.”\r\n\r\nAs New England saddle horses were only worth forty dollars in 1650, and\r\nthis horse cost more than four times as much, when horses were more\r\nplentiful, we must conclude that he was a fine specimen of the breed, and\r\nwas, probably, bought for stock purposes. The date of this transaction is\r\na significant fact that should not be forgotten, as 1711 is the same year\r\nin which the first of the two great founders of the English race horse,\r\nDarley Arabian, was brought to England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL HORSE HISTORY—NEW ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n    First importations to Boston and to Salem—Importations\r\n    from Holland brought high prices—They were not pacers and\r\n    not over fourteen hands—In 1640 horses were exported to\r\n    the West Indies—First American newspaper and first horse\r\n    advertisement—Average sizes—The different gaits—CONNECTICUT,\r\n    first plantation, 1636—Post horses provided for by law—All\r\n    horses branded—Sizes and Gaits—An Englishman’s experience\r\n    with pacers—Lindsay’s Arabian—RHODE ISLAND, Founded by Roger\r\n    Williams, 1636—No direct importations ever made—Horses largely\r\n    exported to other colonies 1690—Possibly some to Canada—Pacing\r\n    races a common amusement—Prohibited 1749—Size of the\r\n    Narragansetts compared with the Virginians.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1629 the London founders of the plantation of Massachusetts Bay sent\r\nout six vessels laden with emigrants, horses, cattle, goats, etc. These\r\nvessels brought some twenty-five head of mares and stallions, that\r\nwere valued at six pounds each and all owned by the company in London,\r\nexcept three mares from Leicester, that were owned by private parties.\r\nAt that time there seems to have been some rivalry between Boston and\r\nSalem as a shipping point, but this fleet came to Boston harbor. This\r\nsame year (1629) Salem seems to have had six or seven mares and one\r\nstallion, besides forty cows, and forty goats. From this it might be\r\nsafely inferred that a part of this fleet put into Salem harbor, or that\r\nthere may have been another and somewhat earlier shipment of which we\r\nhave no details. Salem was really founded in 1626, and the settlement\r\nat Charlestown, Boston, dates from the same year. The next year about\r\nsixty head were shipped to the plantation, but many were lost during the\r\nvoyage, of both horses and cattle. Several other shipments followed,\r\nbut nothing worthy of special note, till 1635, when two Dutch ships\r\narrived at Salem with twenty-seven mares, valued at thirty-four pounds\r\neach, and three stallions. Some writers have spoken of these mares as\r\n“Flanders mares,” but I have not been able to find any evidence or even\r\nindication that this might have been the fact. The records show they\r\nwere Dutch ships, and that on a given day they sailed out of the Texel,\r\na Dutch port, far away from Flanders. I think, therefore, we are safe in\r\nconcluding they were “Dutch mares,” and they should be so designated.\r\nJust about this period they were bringing Dutch horses from Utrecht, in\r\nHolland, to the Dutch colony at New Amsterdam, and it was well known\r\nin Holland as well as in New England that the Dutch horses brought\r\nmuch better prices in New England than the English importations. It is\r\nprobable, further, that these Dutch traders were looking out for a choice\r\nof markets, as between New England and New Netherlands. These mares\r\nwere valued at thirty-five pounds each, the record says, but we are not\r\ninformed as to the price that was really paid for them. There is a very\r\nwide discrepancy between the figure at which these mares were “valued”\r\nand the cost of the mares that were brought from England. The English\r\ncompany charged the colony six pounds each for the horses sent from\r\nthere, and ten pounds freight.\r\n\r\nI have labored assiduously to get at such data as would afford a safe\r\nbasis upon which to determine the size and other qualities of these\r\nDutch horses. They were larger than the English horses of that period\r\nand they were more muscular, with greater weight of bone. They were,\r\ndoubtless, better adapted to the various offices of the “general purpose”\r\nhorse than their English contemporaries, in every respect, except the\r\nsaddle. There is no distinctive evidence that they were pacers or could\r\ngo any of the saddle gaits, in their own right. It is probably safe to\r\nconclude that the original importations would not average more than\r\nfourteen and a half hands high, and very likely the exact truth, if\r\nit could be reached, would place them below that figure rather than\r\nabove it. The process of reducing the size commenced as soon as they\r\narrived: for the English horses had saddle qualities which the Dutch\r\ndid not possess, and everybody wanted a saddle horse. Still the Dutch\r\nblood was highly prized, and a hundred and fifty years afterward it\r\nwas no uncommon thing, especially in the valley of the Connecticut,\r\nto meet with the advertisements of stallions seeking patronage on the\r\nstrength of “Dutch blood.” This, for a time, was a puzzle to me, but\r\nas we consider the horse interests of the region of the Hudson and the\r\nMohawk Valley extending eastward and that of eastern Massachusetts\r\nextending westward along with the current of emigration, it is not\r\ndifficult to understand how the blood of the Dutch horse should have\r\nbecome so generally diffused. On the one hand we had the much-desired\r\nsaddle qualities, and on the other we had the much-desired increase of\r\nsize without deterioration in appearance. Thus owners were accommodated\r\nand the horse stock of the country was improved by the interbreeding\r\nof the two nationalities. It is not necessary to further particularize\r\ndifferent importations. It is sufficient to say that they were very\r\nnumerous, and the multiplying of the stock was carried forward with vigor\r\nand success. Five years later—1640—the colonists not only had all the\r\nhorses they needed, but they shipped a cargo of eighty head to Barbadoes.\r\nFrom the colony of Massachusetts Bay all the plantations of New England\r\nsecured their foundation stock of horses, hence they are here considered\r\ncollectively.\r\n\r\nThe people of the Plymouth plantation were very slow in providing\r\nthemselves with horses, and it was not till after 1632 that they had any.\r\nIt is hard to conceive of a colony like that of Massachusetts Bay living\r\nand flourishing for a period of, say, eighty years without a newspaper,\r\nand yet such is the fact. The Boston _News-Letter_, the first newspaper,\r\nso called, in this country, was established May 29, 1704, and it lived\r\nmany years. The early colonial newspapers, from one end of the land to\r\nthe other, were anything and everything but newspapers, as we understand\r\nthe meaning of the title in our day. If a boy fell off a building in\r\nLondon and broke his leg, six weeks before, it was liable to appear as an\r\nitem of “news” in the local American newspaper, but if the same accident\r\nhappened the week before, in a neighboring town, it was never mentioned.\r\nThe name “newspaper” attached to such publications was a fraud.\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of the first horse advertisement ever published\r\nin this country, and for that reason it is worthy of preservation. It was\r\ntaken from the Boston _News-Letter_ of November 19, 1705:\r\n\r\n    “Strayed from Mr. John Wilson of Braintree, at Mr. Havens’\r\n    in Kingston, in Narragansett, about a fortnight ago, a\r\n    sorrel mare, low stature, four white feet, a white face,\r\n    shod all round, her near ear tore, has a long white tail and\r\n    mane. Whoever will give any intelligence of her ... will be\r\n    sufficiently rewarded.”\r\n\r\nAs this was in the period when the Narragansett pacers had reached their\r\ngreatest fame, we might argue that this mare had been sent down to\r\nKingston from Braintree, Massachusetts, to be wintered and to be bred\r\nin the spring to some famous horse in Kingston, the very center of the\r\nhorse-breeding interests of that day.\r\n\r\nUnder the date of June 17, 1706, I find a bay horse advertised as\r\n“strayed or stolen: fourteen hands high, hardly possible to make him\r\ngallop,” and October 28, 1706, a black gelding “fourteen hands high,\r\npaces, trots, and gallops.” Then in the years 1731 and 1732 I find a\r\n“black mare fourteen and three-quarter hands, trots and paces;” a “black\r\nhorse twelve hands,” no gait given; “black gelding, fourteen hands,\r\nraces, trots, and gallops;” “bay horse large, good pacer;” “roan mare,\r\nfourteen hands, paces and trots.” But the field which I specially gleaned\r\nwas for the years 1756-59, where I found the average height was fourteen\r\nhands one inch, the data including eight pacers and two trotters. This,\r\nI think, may be taken as fairly representative of the size and habit\r\nof action of Massachusetts horses in the first half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn 1636 the first plantation was made in Connecticut at Hartford by the\r\nRev. Thomas Hooker and over a hundred of his congregation with him. They\r\nleft nothing behind, but brought all their domestic animals to their new\r\nhome. I have not been able to discover just how many horses they brought\r\nwith them, but in a few decades they had a great abundance and to spare.\r\nIn 1653 the General Court at New Haven made provision for keeping public\r\nsaddle horses for hire and fixed the rate of charges for their use. It\r\nalso prohibited the sale of horses outside of the colony. In 1658 all\r\nhorses, young and old, had to be branded by an officer appointed for\r\nthat purpose, and it required several years of legislation before the\r\nsystem of branding, selling and recording could be so perfected as to\r\nprevent dishonesty and frauds. In 1674 an act was passed providing and\r\nenjoining that all colts entire and stallions running at large, under\r\nthirteen hands high, should be gelded. This law also required a good\r\ndeal of amending before it could be made to work smoothly. The size of\r\nthe Connecticut horses about the time of the Revolution was an average\r\nof thirteen hands three inches, thus ranging below the other New England\r\ncolonies. In 1778 horse racing was prohibited under the penalty of\r\nforfeiture of the horse and a fine of forty shillings. In 1776 a careful\r\ncompilation of the gaits of the horses of that period, embracing nineteen\r\nindividuals, taken as they came, showed that fifteen were pacers, or\r\npacers and trotters, and four were trotters only. As an evidence of\r\nthe quality of the Connecticut pacers, take the following passage from\r\na little volume published 1769, in England, entitled “A Voyage to North\r\nAmerica,” by G. Taylor, Sheffield, England, 1768-69:\r\n\r\n    “After dinner at New London, Conn., Mr. Williams and I took\r\n    post horses, with a guide to New Haven. Their horses are, in\r\n    general of less size than ours, but extremely stout and hardy.\r\n    A man will ride the same horse a hundred miles a day, for\r\n    several days together, in a journey of five or eight hundred\r\n    miles, perhaps, and the horse is never cleaned. They naturally\r\n    pace, though in no graceful or easy manner, but with such\r\n    swiftness and for so long a continuance as must seem incredible\r\n    to those who have not proved it by experience.”\r\n\r\nThis is a very different view of the pacer from that expressed by another\r\nEnglishman who visited Virginia in 1796. He had never seen a pacer before\r\nand he was wholly unwilling to believe his host when he assured him it\r\nwas a natural gait and that many colts paced from the day they were\r\nfoaled. This, to the mind of the Englishman could not be true, he says,\r\n“for none of our horses ever move in that manner.” (See Virginia, pp.\r\n117-118).\r\n\r\nThe most noted horse ever owned in Connecticut, at least in colonial\r\ndays, was the horse named and known in later times as Lindsay’s Arabian.\r\nWhen I was younger I accepted the marvelous story of the origin and early\r\nhistory of this horse, of which a brief account is given in the chapter\r\non the “American Race Horse,” to which reference is here made. This\r\nacceptance on my part of the romantic story was largely superinduced by\r\na statement made by a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States,\r\nthat he had examined the animal when he was old and found on three of\r\nhis legs undoubted physical evidence that they had at one time been\r\nbroken. This appeared in a reputable publication, but when compared with\r\nsome other facts in the history of the horse that are known, there can\r\nhardly be a doubt that the examination by the justice was a fiction.\r\nWhen I began to realize that the marvelous story was a mere fiction my\r\n“wrath waxed hot” against the people of “the land of steady habits,” to\r\nsay nothing of “wooden nutmegs,” until Mr. O. W. Cook made it very plain\r\nthat the people of Connecticut never had heard of the remarkable story.\r\n(See _Wallace’s Monthly_, Vol. VI., p. 251). Thus it became evident\r\nthat the whole story had been fabricated in Maryland and was a kind of\r\n“green goods” method for catching the unwary. These are my apologies\r\nto the general public and especially to the Connecticut public for\r\nsupposing them guilty of any such fraud. The naked truth of the matter\r\nis, that while this horse may have been imported from England, his public\r\nadvertisements clearly indicate that his owners knew nothing of his blood\r\nor early history.\r\n\r\nThe colony of Rhode Island was planted by Roger Williams and his\r\nfollowers in 1636, and the first patent giving it a legal existence\r\nwas obtained 1647. It was an offshoot from Massachusetts and a protest\r\nagainst the intolerance of that colony in religious affairs. For several\r\nyears I made renewed and persistent efforts to discover whether in\r\nthe early colonial period Rhode Island had ever imported any horses\r\nfrom foreign countries, and after exhausting every source of recorded\r\ninformation, I have not been able to find a single intimation of such\r\nimportation. It is evident, therefore, that the famous Narragansett\r\npacer is simply the result of carefully selecting and breeding from\r\nthe best and the fastest of the descendants of the English pacers, to\r\nbe found everywhere in the colony of Massachusetts. The superiority of\r\nthe Narragansett pacer over all others of his kind seemed to suggest\r\nthe probability that he must have possessed blood that was superior to\r\nall others, and to supply this “want,” a Rhode Islander advanced the\r\nclaim that his grandfather had imported the original stock from Spain.\r\nUnfortunately for this “claim” there were two difficulties in the way\r\nof accepting it. First, there were no pacers in Spain, and second, the\r\nNarragansett pacers were famous for their speed and value before the\r\ngrandfather was born, or at least before he was out of his swaddling\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nThe horse interests of Rhode Island seem to have been active and\r\nsuccessful from the very founding of the colony, and the fame of her\r\npacers extended to all the American colonies at a very early day. When\r\nthe authorities made their report to the Board of Trade at London, in\r\n1690, showing what they had produced and where and how they had disposed\r\nof their surplus, they place horses at the head of their products and\r\nstate that they are shipped to all the English colonies on the American\r\ncoast. This statement is sustained by corresponding facts that are known\r\nin New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Trading with the French colonies\r\nin Canada was rigorously prohibited, but it is quite probable that many a\r\ngood pacing horse found his way to the St. Lawrence in exchange for pelts\r\nand furs. But, as the Narragansett and the pacer generally will be fully\r\nconsidered in another part of this volume, the reader is referred to the\r\nchapters wholly devoted to those topics.\r\n\r\nThat racing was a common amusement of the people of Rhode Island is fully\r\nestablished by the very best of contemporaneous evidence, and by the\r\nsilver plate prizes won, that are said to be still in existence in some\r\nof the old families. Attempts have been made to laugh this statement out\r\nof court, on the grounds that Rhode Island was a Puritan colony, and\r\nsuch a thing as a horse race would not be tolerated for a single day.\r\nThis attempt shows a great deal more smartness than knowledge, for Rhode\r\nIsland was not a Puritan colony, as that term is generally understood,\r\nbut had for its very foundation opposition to the spirit of intolerance\r\nthat prevailed in all the other New England colonies. But, what is still\r\nmore conclusive, the legislature of the colony in 1749 enacted a law\r\nprohibiting all racing, under a penalty of forfeiture of the horse and\r\na fine of one hundred dollars. As in other colonies not in New England\r\nracing and betting had become so common that the moral sense of the\r\npeople rose up and abolished it. If there had been no racing there would\r\nhave been no law to wipe it out.\r\n\r\nWhen the Rev. Dr. McSparran, of Rhode Island, made a trip in Virginia\r\nand rode the Virginia pacers some hundreds of miles, early in the last\r\ncentury, he seems to have observed them closely and spoke very highly of\r\nthem, but he said they were not so large and strong as the Narragansetts,\r\nnor so easy and gliding in their action. It might be suggested that this\r\nopinion was the natural result of esteeming one’s own as better than\r\nthose of a neighbor, but he was certainly right in the matter of size. In\r\n1768 the Rhode Island horses averaged fourteen hands one inch, while the\r\nVirginia horses averaged (1750-52) thirteen hands one and three-quarter\r\ninches, making a difference of three and one-quarter inches in height.\r\nIn the matter of gait they were not all natural pacers, for out of\r\nthirty-five there were eight that did not pace, and some of the others\r\nboth paced and trotted. From this it may be inferred that breeders, in\r\norder to increase the size, had incorporated more or less of the blood of\r\nthe early Dutch importations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL HORSE HISTORY—PENNSYLVANIA, NEW JERSEY, MARYLAND, CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n    Penn’s arrival in 1682—Horse racing prohibited—Franklin’s\r\n    newspaper—Conestoga horses—Sizes and gaits—Swedish\r\n    origin—Acrelius’ statement.

The old Swedish colonists as well as\r\na sprinkling of Englishmen and other nationalities had been there for a\r\ngood many years, and were beginning to get the necessaries as well as the\r\ncomforts of life about them. For their numbers, they had a fair supply of\r\nhorses, cattle, sheep, and swine; and the growing of cereals and fruits\r\nof all kinds showed encouraging progress, with the promise of plenty.\r\nThe new proprietor was gladly welcomed and his rule proved kindly and\r\nbeneficent. In a letter to Lord Ormonde, after his arrival, Mr. Penn, in\r\ndescribing the condition of things in his new colony, says: “The horses\r\nare not very handsome, but good.” The public affairs of Penn’s grant,\r\nbefore his arrival, had been administered in the name of the Duke of\r\nYork, from about the time New Amsterdam had surrendered to the English,\r\nand hence we find sundry regulations with regard to the horse in force\r\nbefore that event.\r\n\r\nThe first of these, having the efficacy of law, was in the year 1676,\r\nrequiring all horses to be branded, and officers appointed to do the\r\nbranding and keep a record of the fact. Besides the individual brands,\r\neach town had its own brand that had to be applied, and by this double\r\nmarking it was supposed that strays could be identified with certainty.\r\nAnother provision was that no mares should be exported to Virginia or\r\nBarbadoes or other foreign plantations. Again, every owner was supposed\r\nto keep a certain number of horses at home, for daily use, and he was\r\nallowed to keep twice that number running at large. In 1682 no stone\r\nhorse under thirteen and one-half hands high was allowed to run at\r\nlarge. This was afterward changed to thirteen hands. In 1724 this law\r\nwas revised and re-enacted so that colts “of comely proportions” and not\r\nmore than one year and a half old, if thirteen hands high, might run at\r\nlarge; but if older than eighteen months they must be fourteen hands high\r\nor suffer the penalty, which was castration. In 1750 horse racing of all\r\nkinds was prohibited, under a severe penalty.\r\n\r\nIn that grand old repository of ancient, curious, and valuable things\r\nrelating to colonial affairs, the New York Historical Society, to which\r\nI am greatly indebted, I found a file of the _Pennsylvania Gazette_,\r\ncommencing with the year 1729, published by “B. Franklin, printer.”\r\nIn that day the term “editor” or “reporter” was not known in the\r\nvocabulary of any well-regulated newspaper office, and for anything of\r\na local character you had to look in the advertising columns. To these\r\nI resorted, as usual, and they presented results that were a great\r\nsurprise to me. Pennsylvania has long been famous for the production\r\nof great massive draft horses, and before the days of railroads just\r\nsuited, with six or eight of them in a team, for the transportation of\r\nfreights from the seaboard to the Ohio River. This was a great business\r\nat the beginning of this century and for forty or fifty years afterward.\r\nThe fame of those great teams, the great wagons and the great loads\r\nthey hauled over the mountains, spread far and wide, and as a special\r\ndesignation that went with them they were called Conestoga horses, and\r\nthe wagons were called Conestoga wagons, named after a creek in Lancaster\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania, where many large horses were bred. There was no\r\nparticular line of blood to be followed, for a large horse bred west\r\nof the mountains was just as certainly a Conestoga as though he had\r\nbeen bred in Lancaster County. The Conestoga was simply the horse that\r\nwas best suited for a big team with an enormous load, and he varied in\r\nsize from sixteen and one-half to eighteen hands in height and from one\r\nthousand six hundred to one thousand nine hundred pounds in weight. These\r\nmeasurements he reached by breeding for the one purpose of strength\r\nand weight. It is safe to conclude that in the latter part of the last\r\ncentury breeding animals of large size were brought over the water, for\r\nwe can hardly conceive of their being descended from the little pacers\r\npreceding them only fifty or sixty years.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania horses of the first half of the last century were\r\nremarkably uniform in size, and from a large number of cases in which\r\nthe size is given I find the exact average was thirteen hands one and\r\none-quarter inches. Of the twenty-eight animals in which the habit of\r\naction is given, twenty-four were pacers, three both paced and trotted,\r\nand just one is given as a natural trotter. Here we have two very\r\nstriking facts—the low stature and the uniformity of the pacing gait.\r\nThese horses average a quarter of an inch below the Virginians, the next\r\nlowest, and a higher ratio of pacers than in any other colony. There must\r\nhave been some reason or reasons for this, and I will suggest two which\r\nstrike me as probably effective in producing these results. The earliest\r\nsettlers in Southeastern Pennsylvania were the Swedes. They brought their\r\nhorses with them from the Old World, and they were undoubtedly pacers,\r\nbut I have no means of determining anything about their size. This may be\r\nan important factor in determining the uniformity of the gait, as well as\r\nthe diminutive size. The other consideration that I will present is the\r\nfact that the pacer was more fashionable in and about Philadelphia, then\r\nthe leading city of the continent, than in any other section or portion\r\nof the colonies. It is a fact that seems to be fully established, that\r\nearly in the last century the breeding of pacing horses was carried on in\r\nthe region of Philadelphia, with much spirit and intelligence, and that\r\npacing stallions for public service were carefully selected for their\r\nshapeliness and speed. It is also a fact that all horses that could not\r\npace were, in the public estimation, classed as basely bred.\r\n\r\nThe Swedes and Finns planted a colony on the west bank of the Delaware in\r\n1638, and as they were an industrious and thrifty people they prospered\r\nand extended their plantation up the river as far as Philadelphia. This\r\nterritory was then claimed by the Dutch of New Netherlands, and they\r\novercame the Swedes in 1655, and ten years later they in turn had to\r\nsurrender to the English. Of the early Swedes, the Rev. Acrelius wrote\r\nand published, in the Swedish language, a very valuable account of\r\nhis people. In speaking of their horses he says: “The horses are real\r\nponies and are seldom over sixteen hands high [evidently a misprint and\r\nshould read “thirteen” instead of “sixteen”]. He who has a good riding\r\nhorse never employs him for draft; which is also the less necessary, as\r\njourneys are for the most part made on horseback. It must be the result\r\nof this, more than of any particular breed in the horses, that the\r\ncountry excels in fast horses, so that horse races are often made for\r\nvery high stakes.” Such horses often sold for sixty dollars in our modern\r\nmoney. The question of the pacers of Philadelphia will be considered more\r\nat length in the chapters devoted to the history of the pacer.\r\n\r\nNEW JERSEY is not known to have made any direct importations of horses\r\nfrom the old country. Lying between New York on the east and Pennsylvania\r\non the west, she had abundant opportunity to get her supply of horses\r\nfrom her neighbors on either side, to say nothing of the overflow from\r\nVirginia about 1669. Like all the other colonies, as early as 1668 her\r\nhorses were ordered to be branded and then suffered to roam at large and\r\nfind their own living. Not much attention seems to have been given to the\r\nidea of improvement in the size and quality of the stock till 1731, when\r\nit was provided by law that all colts of eighteen months old, running at\r\nlarge and under fourteen hands high, should be gelded. I have not made\r\nany attempt to get at the exact average size of the Jersey horses, nor to\r\nascertain the ratio of pacers among them, for we know the environments\r\nand the sources of supply, and in knowing these we know just what the\r\nJersey horses were—a large majority of them were pacers and they were not\r\nover fourteen hands high.\r\n\r\nThe statutes of this colony, enacted 1748, furnished the first real\r\nevidence of record, with one exception, going to show that pacing and\r\ntrotting races, as well as running races, were the common amusement of\r\nthe people in the first half of the last century. They were so common,\r\nindeed, that the legislative authorities declared them a nuisance\r\nand restricted them to certain days in the year. That this was not a\r\n“moral spasm,” as some might call it, that had seized the legislative\r\nauthorities of that particular year, is evident from the fact that,\r\nafterward and from time to time, this statute was amended, and always\r\nin the direction of greater restrictions and greater severity. This is\r\nsufficient evidence that the moral sense of the community sustained the\r\nlawmakers in pronouncing it a nuisance, to be abated. It is not probable\r\nthat pacing and trotting races were any more common or more demoralizing\r\nin New Jersey than in some of the other colonies, but they seem to have\r\nbeen content with fulminating against “horse racing” without specifying\r\nthe different gaits at which the horses might go in the race. Until this\r\nold colonial statute was discovered, it was not possible to prove by\r\ncontemporaneous evidence that there had been any pacing or trotting races\r\nbefore the first decade of the present century. This, however, adds to\r\ntheir antiquity more than a hundred years.\r\n\r\nMARYLAND was really the first in point of time to legislate for the\r\nsuppression of pacing, as well as running races, but the old statute,\r\nenacted in 1747, was not discovered till very recently. This proves that\r\npacing races were very common in Maryland one hundred and sixty years\r\nago, but it says nothing about trotting races. It will be observed that\r\nin the New Jersey statute the different kinds of racing are placed in\r\nthis order: “Racing, pacing and trotting,” and I take this to mean the\r\norder of their prominence. Applying this method to Maryland, it may be\r\ninferred that trotting races were infrequent and practically unknown,\r\nand hence not enumerated as offensive. Taking these two cases together,\r\nI think we are justified in concluding that the pacer antedated and\r\npreceded the trotter in all turf sports. No doubt he was faster then\r\nthan the trotter, and he has maintained his superiority, in that respect\r\nat least, to this day. Maryland was a great racing colony and it was\r\nafterward a great racing State. This statute did not sweep over the\r\nwhole colony, but applied only to the race course at Newmarket, and Anne\r\nArundel and Talbot counties. As I understand the matter, this statute was\r\nenacted specially at the request of the Society of Friends, and for the\r\nprotection of their yearly meetings.\r\n\r\nWith Pennsylvania on the one side and Virginia on the other, it is not\r\nnecessary to spend any time on the sizes and gaits of the horses of\r\nMaryland, for they were simply duplicates of those in the two colonies\r\nwith which they were in constant intercourse and trade. In the matter\r\nof undersized stallions running at large Maryland was more in earnest\r\nand more savage than any of the other colonies. For, by an act of\r\nLegislature, passed 1715, it was provided that any person finding an\r\nentire colt eighteen months old, or an unbroken stoned horse, running at\r\nlarge, no difference what his size, might shoot him upon the spot.\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA was first permanently settled by a colony from Virginia,\r\nled by Roger Green, July, 1653. For some years previous to this it had\r\nbeen the refuge of Quakers and others fleeing from the persecutions and\r\nproscriptions that prevailed in Virginia at that time, against all who\r\ndid not conform to the ritual of the English church. These refugees and\r\ncolonists took their horses and all they had with them, and as this was\r\nbut a few years before there was an overproduction of horses in Virginia,\r\nand great droves were running wild without an owner, we may conclude they\r\ncost but little and that they spread rapidly in the new colony. As we\r\nthus know whence they came, we necessarily know what they were in size\r\nand gait, and we need not trace them any further.\r\n\r\nSOUTH CAROLINA received her colonial charter in 1663, and the\r\nearliest newspaper that I have found was for the year 1744, from the\r\nadvertisements in which I have extracted the following data as to size\r\nand gait. In the first four and the last four months of the _South\r\nCarolina Gazette_ for 1744 I find thirty horses advertised as strayed\r\nor stolen, in which the size is given, and they average within a small\r\nfraction of an inch of thirteen and one-half hands, and of this number\r\nthree are given as fifteen hands, which was considered, in that day, a\r\nlarge horse. Out of this number the gait is given in only twelve cases,\r\nten of which were pacers, one paced and trotted, and one trotted only.\r\nThe foundation horse stock of South Carolina was obtained chiefly, if not\r\nwholly, from Virginia, and the practice of branding and turning out, to\r\nroam at large, prevailed everywhere.\r\n\r\nIn the issues of the _Gazette_ for this year (1744) I find but one\r\nadvertisement of a stallion for public service, and he is called the\r\n“famous racing horse named Roger,” and is advertised as a great, race\r\nhorse, but there is no attempt to give a pedigree or to claim that he\r\npossessed any blood that was not the inheritance of all others. Another\r\nadvertisement is a lengthy challenge from Joseph Butler to run his\r\ngelding Chestnut against any horse, mare or gelding for five hundred or\r\none thousand pounds “inch and weight,” the lowest horse carrying thirteen\r\nstone. No mention or reference is made to his blood, and from these two\r\nfacts we may reasonably infer that at that time there were no strains of\r\nblood, known to the Carolinians, specially bred to run. The distance to\r\nbe run is not definitely mentioned, but it was on a road from one point\r\nto another, and I suppose it was about two and a half, or possibly three\r\nmiles. This was three years before the first English race horse was\r\nimported into Virginia. It has been represented that an old gentleman,\r\nwhose name is forgotten, imported into South Carolina a number of English\r\nrace horses at a period long anterior to this, but that claim has never\r\nbeen in a shape that placed it above very grave suspicion and doubt; and\r\nthe claim accompanying it, in the way of apology, that the old man would\r\nnever allow any of his horses to race, did not improve its credibility.\r\nFrom the advertisements just referred to, it seems evident that there was\r\nno distinctively English running blood in the colony till after this date.\r\n\r\nThis review of the horses of the colonial period embraces all that I\r\nhave been able to glean of the character, qualifications, size and\r\nhabit of action of the earliest importations and their descendants.\r\nTheir diminutive size will be a surprise to my readers as it has been\r\nto me, and the overwhelming ratio of pacers to trotters will be a still\r\ngreater surprise. The importance of increasing the size by judicious\r\nselections of the largest seems to have been ever present to the minds\r\nof the colonists, but not much could be accomplished in that direction,\r\nunder the system prevalent everywhere of roaming at large. The little\r\npacers were great saddle horses, and down to the days of good roads and\r\nwheeled vehicles they were deemed indispensable. That there were race\r\nhorses among them at the running, pacing and trotting gaits there is\r\nindisputable evidence, covering about a hundred years of the colonial\r\nperiod, but there is no record of the rate of speed. The pacer was the\r\nfavorite and fashionable horse of that period, and after something has\r\nbeen said about the Canadian horse we will take up his history and treat\r\nit with that fullness its importance demands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nEARLY HORSE HISTORY—CANADA.\r\n\r\n    Settlement and capture of Port Royal—Early plantations—First\r\n    French horses brought over 1665—Possibly illicit trading—Sire\r\n    of “Old Tippoo”—His history—“Scape Goat” and his\r\n    descendants—Horses of the Maritime Provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore taking up the two provinces of the Dominion—Quebec and Ontario—to\r\nwhich reference is made in this volume as “Canada,” there is an incident\r\nin the history of Nova Scotia, full of sadness, that I cannot pass over\r\nwithout mention. The French made a settlement here in 1602, and named the\r\ncountry New France. The settlement to which I refer was at Port Royal,\r\nafterward named Annapolis by the English. This seems to have been a\r\nthrifty and flourishing little plantation, far removed from all outside\r\nassociations, except the savages of the forests, with whom they lived in\r\npeace. The first horses brought to North America were owned and bred by\r\nthe people of Port Royal. In November, 1613, Captain Argall, of Virginia,\r\norganized a plundering expedition, and having learned of the defenseless\r\ncondition of Port Royal from Captain John Smith, he sailed up there with\r\ntwo or three ships, captured the place and carried away horses, cattle,\r\nsheep, wheat, farming utensils, and indeed everything their ships would\r\ncarry, and then sailed away to Virginia. This raid was without authority\r\nor orders, but it was winked at by the officials, and forthwith a second\r\nraid was made by Argall, and all that had been left in the first was\r\ncarried away in the second, as well as some of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe pacer of Canada, generally believed to be of French origin, has\r\nlong been an object of diligent investigation, without reaching any\r\nsatisfactory results. Again and again I have gone over the first\r\nhalf-century of the history of the French plantations on the St.\r\nLawrence; examining everything in the English language that held out any\r\nhope of throwing light upon the question, but nothing was revealed. The\r\ntrouble was that my search stopped a little short of the date when the\r\nfirst horses arrived. The management of the affairs of the plantations\r\non the St. Lawrence being in a company located in France, there was a\r\nlack of vigor, not much growth, and still less profits to the projectors\r\nof the colony. The energies of the people seemed to be directed almost\r\nwholly to collecting and trading in peltry instead of building up a\r\ncommonwealth from the productions of the soil. For half a century these\r\nprimitive people lived without horses. Their farms, if they could be\r\ncalled farms, all had a frontage on the water, running back in narrow\r\nstrips to the highlands. They did their plowing with cattle and their\r\ncanoes supplied the place of the saddle horse, the family carriage and\r\nthe lumber wagon to carry the scanty surplus of their little farms to\r\nmarket. At last the company in France, holding direction and control, got\r\nout of the way, and the king of France assumed direct authority over the\r\naffairs of the plantation. On June 30, 1665, the Marquis de Tracy arrived\r\nat Quebec, as viceroy, with a numerous suite of retainers and a regiment\r\nof French soldiers. Two months later a large fleet arrived bringing\r\nmany colonists, embracing artisans, farmers, peasants, etc., with their\r\nfamilies, and a good number of horses, the first that had ever been seen\r\non the St. Lawrence. There is a tradition that a horse had been sent over\r\nto the governor in 1642, but it is probable he was lost on the voyage, as\r\nthe older people of the colony had no recollection or knowledge of any\r\nsuch animal. These colonists came from the ancient province of Picardy,\r\nnot now to be found on the modern maps of France, but it lay on the\r\nEnglish Channel in the extreme northwest of France. As it is expressly\r\nstated that these colonists came from Picardy, it is fair to conclude\r\nthat the horses came from that portion of the kingdom also. At this\r\nperiod in history there had been no wars between France and England for\r\nmany years, and commercial as well as social intercourse had long been\r\ncultivated between the people on both sides of the channel. We know but\r\nlittle of the early horse history of France, but in our own time we know\r\nthat France has been largely benefited by the diffusion of the English\r\nblood among her horse stock, so we may conclude that if a man in Kent had\r\na horse that a man in Picardy wanted, he very soon got him in the way of\r\nlegitimate trade. I think, therefore, it is safe to conclude that the\r\nhorse stock of Northwestern France and the horse stock of England were\r\nvery much the same in appearance, action and blood. On this basis of\r\nreasoning, which involves no improbabilities, we may conclude that the\r\nsame proportion of the horses from Picardy were natural pacers.\r\n\r\nThere is another theory, giving the Canadian pacer an Anglo-American\r\norigin, that commends itself to the unbiased judgment with even greater\r\nforce than the one just suggested. Various writers have talked about\r\nthe “French characteristics” of the Canadian pacer, and all that, when\r\nprobably not one of them ever saw a horse that he _knew_ to be French.\r\nThe early pacers—the pacing-bred pacers—all have more or less strongly\r\nmarked resemblances, especially in conformation, and it makes no\r\ndifference whether they come from Canada or whether their habitat has\r\nbeen south of Mason and Dixon’s line for two hundred and fifty years.\r\nWhen we look at a pacer, therefore, we may as well be honest and say we\r\ndon’t know whether he resembles the horses that reached the St. Lawrence\r\nin 1665, or those that reached Massachusetts Bay in 1629. The theory\r\nthat the French Canadians got the foundation of their pacing stock from\r\nthe New England colonies rests upon two well-known facts. First, the\r\ncolonies had a great abundance of such horses for sale; and second, they\r\nwere within reach of and purchasable by the Canadians. To these two facts\r\nrendering the theory possible, we have others which render it probable.\r\nThe jealous restrictions sought to be imposed on both the English and\r\nFrench colonists by the home governments of both people strongly indicate\r\nthat there was no small amount of illicit trading, and this trading,\r\nin the very nature of things, must have been between the English and\r\nFrench. Toward the close of the seventeenth century the English colonies,\r\nespecially Rhode Island, had far more horses than they needed for home\r\nuse, and they did a thriving business in exporting them to different\r\nparts. These were just the kind of horses the Canadians needed for their\r\nwild life in the wilderness; they were cheaper than they could be brought\r\nfrom France; the water way of Lake Champlain was convenient; pelts and\r\nfurs were a desirable commodity of exchange, and there was no cordon of\r\ncustoms officers to keep the willing traders apart. Of these theories we\r\nconsider the second the more probable of the two, and if we accept it\r\nwe reach the conclusion that the so-called “French” Canadian pacer is\r\nmerely a descendant of the old English pacer brought over by the early\r\nNew England colonists. Objection has been presented to this theory, on\r\nthe grounds that the powerful confederation of the Six Nations Indians\r\ninterposed an insurmountable barrier to all trade, whether legitimate or\r\nillicit, between the Canadians and the colonists of New England. This\r\nobjection is certainly conclusive as applied to the different periods\r\nof hostilities, but the hostilities were not continuous. During both\r\nthe seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries there were periods of\r\nyears at a stretch when there were no hostilities, and when there was\r\nnothing to prevent the Canadian and the Yankee from coming together and\r\nexchanging what they each had that the other wanted. The border abounds\r\nin traditions of the incidents connected with this illicit trading, but\r\nwe need not go to the border in the wilderness to learn that the desire\r\nto “beat the customs” is almost universal. We can see it manifested every\r\nday at the docks in New York, when a steamer arrives from abroad. The\r\nfine lady, with her gloves and lots of other lingerie that she has been\r\ncontriving all the way across how best to keep from the sight of the\r\nofficer, is no better and no worse than the “Canuck,” who in a retired\r\nplace at midnight trades his peltry to the Yankee for his horse. If the\r\nCanadian pacer did not have his origin in New England it was not because\r\nhe could not be carried across the border.\r\n\r\nWhen we enter upon the consideration of the actual performers descended\r\nfrom the original Canadian stock, we find both pacers and trotters of\r\nspeed and merit, but in attempting to trace them to their particular\r\nancestors we find ourselves in a labyrinth from which there seems to be\r\nno deliverance. In the midst of this darkness I am glad to be able to\r\nsay there is a ray of light that illumines much that has been obscure.\r\nThe greatest progenitor of trotters and pacers that Canada has produced,\r\n“Old Tippoo,” has been fully identified in his true origin, and he has\r\nbeen well named “The Messenger of Canada.” He seemed to be known all\r\nover Canada as the greatest of their trotting and pacing sires, and many\r\nattempts were made through several years to give his pedigree, but in all\r\nthese attempts there were elements of weakness and in many of them very\r\nbald absurdities.\r\n\r\nWhen the roan gelding Tacony made his record of 2:27, away back in 1853,\r\nthe performance was looked upon as something that would not be surpassed\r\nin a generation at least. Then when Toronto Chief made his saddle record\r\nof 2:24½, ten or twelve years later, and it was found that he and Tacony\r\nwere both descended from a Canadian horse called Tippoo, the inquiry\r\nbecame quite active as to what Tippoo was, and all kinds of imaginable\r\nstories were told about him. In the search for the history and breeding\r\nof the horse Tippoo, extending through more than twenty years, many\r\ncurious and some impossible things were developed, and as these old\r\n“fads” may come as new discoveries in future generations, I will mention\r\ntwo or three of them here. The first of these untruthful statements to\r\nassume tangible form was to the effect that Tippoo was imported from\r\nEngland, and that he was got there by Nesthall’s Messenger. I never\r\ncould tell how or where this story originated, but it first appeared in\r\nthe pedigree given to Toronto Chief when he went into the stud on Long\r\nIsland. This was settled by the facts, expressed in very few words, that\r\nthe horse was not imported, but bred in Canada, and that there was no\r\nsuch horse in England as “Nesthall’s Messenger.”\r\n\r\nThe next representation came from an old horseman, Mr. V. Sheldon, of\r\nCanton, New York, a very intelligent and careful correspondent, who\r\nhad given much labor to the question. He had learned from different\r\nsources, that were satisfactory to his mind, that a Mr. Howard, a\r\ntraveling preacher, had ridden a mare from Lowville, New York, over into\r\nCanada; that this mare was in foal “by a very noted horse that stood\r\nat Lowville;” that when the mare became too heavy for his use under\r\nthe saddle he sold her to Isaac Morden, and that the foal she dropped\r\nwas the famous Tippoo. The name of the “very famous horse that stood\r\nat Lowville” was not remembered, but as Ogden’s Messenger was there\r\nat that time—1816-17—the conclusion followed that he was the horse.\r\nThis representation was far from complete, but as there was nothing\r\nunreasonable about it, and nothing known to be untrue, I accepted it for\r\na time, awaiting further light.\r\n\r\nThe third representation came from Mr. Lewis T. Leavens, of Bloomfield,\r\nOntario, who was born 1792, and was, therefore, old enough to have had\r\nsome personal knowledge of the horse. But whether his knowledge was\r\npersonal or only traditional cannot now be made to appear. He says that\r\nTippoo was got by a horse called Escape, and I will ask the reader to\r\nnote this name “Escape” as we progress. He says that “when Escape was on\r\nthe ocean, the vessel encountered a severe gale, and the horse had to be\r\nthrown overboard, and he was picked up the ninth day off the coast of\r\nNewfoundland, on a bar, eating rushes.” This silly and ridiculous story\r\nhad been told and possibly believed by some fools more than a hundred\r\nyears before the dates here implied by Mr. Leavens. It is probable it\r\nwas first told as a joke, by some wag in Rhode Island, when asked about\r\nthe origin of the Narragansett pacers. He replied that the original\r\nNarragansett “was caught swimming in mid-ocean, when a ship came along,\r\nlassoed him, pulled him on board, and landed him safely in Narragansett\r\nBay.” The vitality of the joke probably had its origin in the experience\r\nof Rip Van Dam, when in 1711 he went up to Narragansett for a flying\r\npacer, which is related in another part of this volume. Mr. Leavens\r\nspeaks of the Rev. Erastus as the owner of the dam, and the breeder of\r\nthe horse; but he says the horse did not come into possession of Isaac\r\nMorden till he was six or eight years old. The date of his death is\r\nfixed by Mr. Leavens in 1835, and while he is more definite than our\r\ninformation from other sources, all agree he died from a kick about that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe next representation that seems to be worthy of noticing is a\r\ncommunication that appeared in the New York _Sportsman_, written by\r\nsomebody who signs himself “Dick.” Whether “Dick” is in earnest and\r\nbelieves what he writes, or whether he is merely trying to “sell”\r\nsomebody, we will leave for him to decide. He seems to depend upon\r\nMr. Morden, at one time the owner of the horse, as the source of his\r\ninformation. “Dick” says the sire of Tippoo was imported into New York in\r\n1811, and was called Fleetwood. Why did he not tell us by whom the horse\r\nFleetwood was imported? If there was a man in New York in 1811 so big a\r\nfool as to import an English stallion at great expense, and then send him\r\nup to the wilderness of Canada where there was neither money nor mares,\r\nhis name should be handed down as a historical curiosity. The whole story\r\nis a “fake.”\r\n\r\nIn January, 1883, I received from the Hon. J. P. Wiser, of Prescott,\r\nOntario, the following letter, which he had just received from the writer:\r\n\r\n                                     WELLINGTON, December 27, 1882.\r\n\r\n    As the origin of the Tippoo horses seems to be a mystery to you\r\n    I will tell you. Erastus Howard was a traveling preacher in\r\n    those days, and he traveled on horseback. He bought in Kingston\r\n    a dark chestnut mare and bred her to a horse called “The Scape\r\n    Goat,” brought from Narragansett Bay, in Rhode Island. The\r\n    horse was a large brown horse, and could rack (pace) faster\r\n    than he could run. The colt was coal black and large, and was\r\n    sold to Mr. Wilcox, who named him Tippoo Sultan. His gait was\r\n    like the “Scape” some, but soon squared off to a trot, and the\r\n    way he could go was dreadful. In June, 1836, he broke his leg\r\n    and was lost.\r\n\r\n                                                      WILSON SERLS.\r\n\r\nThis short letter was a great surprise, for never before had I heard\r\nof Mr. Serls. Through the kindness of Mr. Wiser he had entered the\r\ndiscussion, evidently without knowing anything about what representations\r\nhad been made by others. His short, crisp sentences seemed to be an\r\nepitome of a history of this horse, which he might be able to give. It\r\nwill be observed that the traveling preacher, Erastus Howard, is still\r\nin the foreground, and that Mr. Leavens’ “Escape” and Mr. Serls’ “Scape\r\nGoat” are evidently one and the same horse, and thus these two men\r\npractically confirm each other, so far as the identity of the horse is\r\nconcerned. No time was lost in preparing a series of questions to be\r\nsubmitted to Mr. Serls, embracing the sources of his information, for\r\nalthough well advanced in years he certainly could not have had personal\r\nknowledge of what he testified. These questions not only covered the\r\nminute points in the history of the matter, but they were so framed as\r\nto test the accuracy and honesty of his memory. In due time they came\r\nback fully and satisfactorily answered, and as these answers embrace\r\nmany things that my readers care nothing about I will condense them into\r\nnarrative form.\r\n\r\nMr. Serls derived his information from his uncle, Stephen Niles, the\r\nbrother of his mother. In 1798 Stephen Niles took a band of horses to\r\nPrince Edward County, and stopped with an uncle of his who was then a\r\nmember of the provincial parliament, living on the Bay of Quinte. His\r\nuncle prevailed upon him to settle there. In 1800 he was married, and\r\nbought a farm of two hundred acres four miles west of Wellington, where\r\nhe lived many years, and the place is still known as Niles’ Corners.\r\nHe was an orthodox Quaker in his religious belief, and for a number of\r\nyears he was one of the bench of magistrates for Prince Edward County.\r\nWhen the War of 1812 broke out he was employed by the British forces in\r\nprocuring hay and grain for the mounted troops. In 1858 he died, leaving\r\nan honorable name behind him.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war the military authorities sold off a large number\r\nof horses to the highest bidder, and Mr. Niles was present when the\r\ntraveling preacher, Erastus Howard, bid off a dark chestnut mare for\r\nninety-three dollars, at Kingston. This mare afterward became the dam\r\nof the famous Tippoo, and as a matter of course nothing can ever be\r\nknown of her breeding. In 1816 a man from Rhode Island, whose name is\r\nnot definitely remembered, but believed to be Williams, traveled the\r\nhorse Scape Goat through Prince Edward County, and he stopped one day\r\nand night in each week at the house of Stephen Niles, and during that\r\nseason Mr. Howard bred his chestnut mare to this horse, and, as already\r\nsaid, the produce was Tippoo. This black colt passed into the hands\r\nof Mr. Wilcox, who gave him his name, and he afterward passed through\r\nseveral other hands before he reached Mr. Morden about 1826, and he died\r\nten years later from the effects of a kick. As the horse Scape Goat was\r\nbrought from Narragansett Bay, and as he was a remarkably fast pacer,\r\nthere can be no mistake in calling him a “Narragansett Pacer.” He was\r\nconsiderably larger than the average of that tribe, but this does not\r\nvitiate his title to a place in that family. It seems he was only kept in\r\nPrince Edward County the one season, and his owner, not being satisfied\r\nwith the extent of his earnings, took him back to Rhode Island. Thus, the\r\nhorse that has been proudly designated as “Canada’s Messenger,” was the\r\nson of a Narragansett pacer. In his younger days, Tippoo paced like his\r\nsire, but as he grew older the trotting gait was more fully developed.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that the immediate progeny of Tippoo were numerous, and\r\nit is safe to say that some of them, either as trotters or pacers, were\r\nfast for their day, but it must be confessed that we know very little\r\nabout the way they were bred. One son was called Sportsman, but nothing\r\nis known of his dam and very little of the horse himself beyond the fact\r\nthat he was the sire of the roan gelding Tacony, that trotted some great\r\nraces about 1853, and made a record of 2:27. This horse had a son called\r\nYoung Sportsman, that was more widely known as “the Sager Horse,” and his\r\nhorse became the sire of the trotting mare Clara, or Crazy Jane, as she\r\nwas at one time called, that made a record of 2:27 in 1867. Beyond these\r\ntwo representatives of the Sportsman line, I have not been able to go. It\r\nhas been claimed that another son of Tippoo, called Wild Deer, was the\r\nsire of the Sager Horse, but it does not seem to be well sustained. There\r\nwas a son called Wild Deer, and several others that have been mentioned\r\nby turf writers, but no particulars of any value have been given.\r\n\r\nWarrior, or Black Warrior, as he is sometimes called, was a brown horse\r\nand not a black, as his latter name would imply. He was a son of old\r\nTippoo and his dam was a black mare owned and ridden by an officer in an\r\nEnglish regiment, known as the First Royals. She was a black mare and\r\nafter she was sold out of the service she was called “Black Warrior,”\r\nand this name was transmitted to her son. This mare was for a long time\r\nrepresented as the dam of Royal George, but she was the dam of his sire.\r\nThis horse was bred at Belleville, Ontario, and about 1840 a certain Mr.\r\nJohnston was moving from Belleville to Michigan. He had this horse with\r\nhim, which, becoming lame on the way, he traded to a Mr. Barnes, living\r\nabout twenty miles south of London, Ontario. He was a valuable horse and\r\nleft many very useful animals. Many of his get were pacers, and he was\r\nkept by Mr. Barnes till he died.\r\n\r\nRoyal George was a brown-bay horse, foaled about 1842, and was got by\r\nWarrior, son of Tippoo. His dam was the off one of a pair of bay mares\r\ntaken to that vicinity from Middlebury, Vermont, by a Mr. Billington.\r\nThis mare got her foot in a log bridge and the injury made her a\r\ncomparative cripple for life. Being thus unfitted for road work, Mr.\r\nBillington sold or traded her to Mr. Barnes. She was bred to Warrior\r\nand produced Royal George. It is said by those who knew both animals,\r\nthat this mare was a better trotter than Warrior, and from this springs\r\nthe argument that Royal George had a trotting inheritance from his dam\r\nas well as from his sire. To learn whence this inheritance came, I have\r\nlabored assiduously for years without being able to technically determine\r\nit. The single fact that her sire in Vermont was known as “the Bristol\r\nHorse,” is beyond all doubt, but as Mr. Billington was not living when\r\nthis search was commenced, it has not been possible to determine just\r\nwhat horse is meant by “Bristol Horse.” At one time Harris’ Hambletonian\r\nwas known very widely as “Bristol Grey” or “Bristol Horse,” and this\r\nis the only horse in the records so designated. It may, therefore, be\r\nassumed as more than a probability that this was the sire of the dam of\r\nRoyal George.\r\n\r\nWhen three or four years old he was sold by Mr. Barnes to James Forshee,\r\nand he was known as “the Forshee Horse” for several years. He was sixteen\r\nhands high, not very handsome, but well formed, with plenty of substance\r\nand stamina, good action, and a first class “business” horse for anything\r\nthat was wanted of him. In the stud, at low prices, he was largely\r\npatronized, and during the other months of the year he was employed in\r\nall kinds of drudgery. From Forshee he passed to Frank Munger, and from\r\nMunger to Mr. Doherty, of St. Catherines, for four hundred dollars, and\r\nhe gave him the name of Royal George, and kept him many years. In 1858 W.\r\nH. Ashford, of Lewiston, New York, bought him and kept him two or three\r\nyears there and at Buffalo. He seems to have passed into Doherty’s hands\r\nagain, and died at St. Catherine’s, December, 1862. It is not known that\r\nhe ever had any training as a trotter except what he got from his owner\r\non the road, and there is no tradition of his ever having been in a race\r\nbut once, and that was on the ice at Hamilton, about 1852, against the\r\nfamous State of Maine, for a considerable wager. In this contest he was\r\nthe winner. His highest rate of speed was about 2:50 under the saddle.\r\nHe was strongly disposed to pace, but when he got down to his work his\r\ngait was a square, mechanical trot. He left a numerous progeny with a\r\nheavy sprinkling of pacers among them; they were generally of fine size\r\nand very useful animals. Many of his sons were kept entire and that\r\nwhole region of Ontario was filled up with Royal Georges, to say nothing\r\nof the large numbers that were brought across the border. He left one\r\nrepresentative in the 2:30 list, and five sons that became sires of\r\nperformers.\r\n\r\nToronto Chief was the best son of Royal George, according to the records.\r\nHe was a brown horse, foaled 1850, and was bred by George Larue, of\r\nMiddlesex County, Ontario. His dam was a small bay mare by a horse called\r\nBlackwood, and his grandam was by Prospect. The horse Blackwood “was\r\nbought of a Frenchman below Montreal in 1837,” and that is all that can\r\nbe said of his blood. He was a horse of fine size and went with great\r\ncourage. Toronto Chief passed through several hands before he reached\r\nhis owner, A. Bathgate, of New York. He was a horse of great speed for\r\nhis day, having a record of 2:31 in harness and 2:24¼ under saddle. He\r\nleft three representatives in the 2:30 list, and among them the famous\r\nThomas Jefferson, 2:23, with thirty-nine heats to his credit. Six of his\r\nsons became sires of trotters, and five of his daughters producers. Like\r\nall the other minor families, the Royal George family is surely being\r\nabsorbed or submerged in trotting strains of more positive and uniform\r\nprepotency.\r\n\r\nIt is probably true that Old Columbus and Old St. Lawrence were both\r\ndescended from the Tippoo family, as they were both bred in Canada and\r\nseemed to possess and transmit the same characteristics as the Royal\r\nGeorges possessed, in conformation and gait. Their descendants were\r\nnot numerous, but so many of them were able to show such a rate of\r\nspeed, either at the lateral or diagonal gait, that they left a distinct\r\ntrace on the trotting stock of the United States. Old Pacing Pilot has\r\nalways been classed as a Canadian, but no trace of his origin has ever\r\nbeen secured, and it is impossible at this day to give any definite\r\ninformation as to whether he was brought from Canada or not. Some forty\r\nor fifty years ago the “Canadian pacers” were so highly esteemed for\r\ntheir speed that very many horses were called “Canadians” that never\r\nsaw Canada. The original Tom Hal was purchased in Philadelphia as early\r\nas 1828, and was always called a Canadian. He was the progenitor of\r\nthe great pacing family still bearing his name, that is doubtless the\r\nmost noted pacing family now in existence. Sam Hazzard, it is said, was\r\nbrought from Canada about 1844, and left some noted descendants. Many\r\nothers might be named, but as they never gained great celebrity, and as\r\ntheir origin is not fully established, I will leave the Canadians for\r\nfuture investigators.\r\n\r\nThe rich province of Ontario has always been, in all its ways, the most\r\nEnglish section of the Canadian Confederation, and in nothing more than\r\nin horsemanship. True, it is now a great trotting region, but running is\r\nand always has been the sport of the rich and fashionable, and almost\r\nall the English horses imported in Canada have gone to Western Ontario.\r\nOn the other hand, in the Maritime Provinces—New Brunswick, Nova Scotia,\r\nand Prince Edward Island—running races have never been popular, except\r\nat Halifax, which is a great military station and socially and otherwise\r\nmuch influenced by its English army and navy residents. It is the only\r\npoint in the provinces where running meetings are given or where the\r\nrunning horse is at all cherished. For generations the principal sport of\r\nthe people of these provinces has been trotting and pacing races, winter\r\nand summer, for ice racing is very general and very popular, through\r\nMaritime as well as Western Canada, the numbers of great bays and wide\r\nrivers affording ample courses, everywhere, throughout the long winters.\r\nThough there is, through these provinces, a generous sprinkling of horses\r\ncalled French Canadian, it is a fact that when we write the horse history\r\nof Maine we have written that of the Maritime Canadian provinces. The\r\nbest of the early trotting stock of these provinces came from Maine,\r\nand the most and the best of the old-time trotters of New Brunswick,\r\nNova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island were of tribes loosely described\r\nas Maine Messengers. For this there are ample geographical and natural\r\nreasons. That part of Quebec nearest them has never been rich in horses\r\nnor in anything else which the Provincials want, or in which they trade.\r\nThe people of eastern New England are their natural trading neighbors,\r\nand the city of St. John, New Brunswick, especially in the past, the\r\ncommon market place; and almost all the earlier Maritime trotting sires\r\ntrace through St. John to Maine, or some of the other New England\r\nStates. It is a fact, too, that for generations enterprising horsemen,\r\nin the lower provinces, have been importing American trotting stallions\r\nfor service, and to-day the trotting stock of these provinces is very\r\nthoroughly Americanized. While the exportation of horses, principally to\r\nBoston and Bangor, is one of the industries of Nova Scotia and of Prince\r\nEdward Island especially, almost without exception trotting and pacing\r\nstallions in use there are imported American horses, or the descendants\r\nof American trotting sires; while, as we have noted, the foundation stock\r\ncame chiefly from Maine, and in very small degree from Ontario or Quebec.\r\nIn either of the Maritime provinces it is a rarity to find a trotting\r\nhorse that has not more or less of American blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nANTIQUITY AND HISTORY OF THE PACING HORSE.\r\n\r\n    The mechanism of the different gaits—The Elgin Marbles—Britain\r\n    becomes a Roman province—Pacers in the time of the\r\n    Romans—Bronze horses of Venice—Fitz Stephen, the Monk of\r\n    Canterbury—Evidence of the Great Seals—What Blundeville\r\n    says—What Gervaise Markham says—What the Duke of Newcastle\r\n    says—The amble and the pace one and the same—At the close of\r\n    Elizabeth’s reign—The Galloways and Hobbies—Extinction of the\r\n    pacer—The original pacer probably from the North—Polydore\r\n    Virgil’s evidence—Samuel Purchas’ evidence—The process\r\n    of wiping out the pacer—King James set the fashion—All\r\n    foreign horses called “Arabians”—The foreigners larger and\r\n    handsomer—Good roads and wheeled vehicles dispensed with the\r\n    pacer—Result of prompting Mr. Euren—Mr. Youatt’s blunder—Other\r\n    English gentlemen not convinced there ever were any pacers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering the antiquity and history of the pacing horse, it seems\r\nto be necessary that we should have a clear perception of the mechanism\r\nof the gait from which he takes his distinctive name and the relation\r\nwhich that mechanism bears to other gaits or means of progression. In\r\nthe study of this mechanism we learn the combination by which we unlock\r\nthe mystery that has puzzled so many breeders of the past and present\r\ngenerations. Some have maintained that the pace is a combination of the\r\ntrot and the gallop, while a smaller number have maintained that the fast\r\ntrot was a combination of the pace and the gallop. It is quite evident,\r\nas I will be able to show, that neither of these parties has ever given\r\nany careful attention and study to the mechanism of the different gaits.\r\nThe most simple and least complicated method of illustrating this\r\nmechanism of movement is furnished in the human means of progression. At\r\nthe walk, a man steps off with his left foot and the heel of that foot\r\nstrikes the ground before the toe of the right foot leaves it. Then the\r\nright foot advances and strikes the ground before the toe of the left\r\nfoot leaves it. This is the natural “heel and toe” walk, and the speed\r\nmay be increased by quickening the step and extending the stride, so\r\nfar as physical conformation will permit. Still greater speed becomes\r\na succession of bounds, the propelling foot leaving the ground before\r\nthe advanced foot strikes it. This is running, the highest rate of speed\r\nattainable, and in every revolution, for a space, the whole body is in\r\nthe air. In the action of the horse, with four legs, we find greater\r\ncomplication, which I will try to make clear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STAR POINTER.\r\n\r\nBy Brown Hal, strictly pacing bred, record 1:59¼, 1897.]\r\n\r\nFirst, all horses walk, all horses pace or trot, and all horses gallop.\r\nThe walk is easily analyzed, for it is slow and the movement of each\r\nlimb can be followed by the eye. Each foot makes its own stroke upon the\r\nground, and we count one, two, three, four in the revolution.\r\n\r\nSecond, at the gallop, which is a succession of leaps, each limb, as\r\nshown by the instantaneous photograph, performs its own function, whether\r\nin rising from the ground, flying through the air, or in striking the\r\nground again. There is harmony in all, but there is no unity in any two\r\nor more of them, and when they strike the ground again you hear the\r\nimpacts, one, two, three, four, in a cluster. The conventional drawing\r\nof the running horse in action is impossible in nature, and a wretched\r\ncaricature of the action as it is. As in the walk, so in the run, we\r\ncount four impacts in the revolution.\r\n\r\nThird, at the pace the horse advances the two feet, on the same side,\r\nat the same time, and when they reach the ground again there is but one\r\nimpact; then the two feet on the other side are advanced and strike in\r\nthe same way. Thus, the rhythm of the action strikes the ear as that of\r\nthe movement of an animal with two feet instead of four. In this there\r\ncan be no mechanical mistake, for in the revolution of the four-legged\r\npacing horse we count one, two, and in the revolution of the two-legged\r\nman we count one, two. The conclusion, therefore, seems to be inevitable\r\nthat the two legs on the same side of the pacing horse act in perfect\r\nunison in performing the functions of one leg. At the trot the horse\r\nadvances the two diagonal feet at the same time, and when they reach\r\nthe ground again there is but one impact; then the two other diagonal\r\nfeet are advanced and strike in the same way. Thus, the rhythm of the\r\naction strikes the ear as that of the movement of an animal with two feet\r\ninstead of four. In this there can be no mechanical mistake, for in the\r\nrevolution of the four-legged trotting horse we count one, two, and in\r\nthe revolution of the two-legged man we count one, two. The conclusion,\r\ntherefore, seems to be inevitable that the two diagonal legs of the\r\ntrotting horse act in perfect unison in performing the function of one\r\nleg. In the mechanism of the gait then that is midway between the walk\r\nand the gallop there is no difference in results, nor distinction in the\r\neconomy of motion, except that the pacer uses the lateral legs as one,\r\nand the trotter the diagonal legs as one. In use, there is a vertical\r\ndistinction, if that term should be allowed, between the gait of the\r\npacer and the trotter. The action of the pacer is lower and more gliding\r\nwhich fits him for the saddle, while the action of the trotter is higher\r\nand more bounding which makes him more desirable as a harness horse.\r\nIn the processes of inter-breeding to the fastest, this distinction,\r\nif it be a distinction, seems to be coming less real, or at least less\r\nobservable.\r\n\r\nWhile the essential oneness of the pace and the trot is indicated above\r\nfrom the mechanism and unity of the two gaits, there is a great mountain\r\nof evidence to be developed when we reach the consideration of breeding\r\nsubjects, in which we will meet multitudes of fast trotters getting fast\r\npacers, and fast pacers getting fast trotters; fast pacers changed over\r\nto fast trotters and fast trotters changed over to fast pacers, and the\r\nfinal evidence that speed at the one gait means speed at the other.\r\nHaving briefly explained what a pacer is, it is now in order to take up\r\nthe question of whence he came.\r\n\r\nOn the summit of the Acropolis, in Athens, stand the ruins of the\r\nParthenon, a magnificent temple erected to the goddess Minerva. The\r\nbuilding was commenced in the year B.C. 437, and was completed five years\r\nafterward. All the statuary was the work of the famous Phidias and his\r\nscholars, made from Pentelic marble. This noted building resisted all the\r\nravages of time, and had, in turn, been converted into a Christian temple\r\nand a Turkish mosque. In 1676 it was still entire, but in 1687 Athens was\r\nbesieged by the Venetians, and the Parthenon was hopelessly wrecked. As\r\na ruin it became the prey of the Turks and all other devastators, and in\r\norder to save something of what remained of its precious works of art,\r\nLord Elgin, about the year 1800, brought home to England some portions\r\nof the frieze of the temple, with other works of Phidias, in marble,\r\nsold them to the government, and they are preserved in the British\r\nMuseum. This frieze is a most interesting subject to study, not only as a\r\nspecimen of Greek art of the period of Pericles, but as a historic record\r\nof the type and action of the Greek horses of that day. It consists\r\nof a series of white marble slabs, something over four feet wide, upon\r\nwhich are sculptured, in high relief, the heroes and defenders of Athens,\r\nmounted on horses, and some of these horses are pacing, while others are\r\ntrotting and cantering. This is the first undoubted record we have of the\r\npacer, and it is now over two thousand three hundred and thirty years old.\r\n\r\nBritain became a Roman province in the reign of Claudius, in the first\r\npart of the first century of the Christian era, and it continued under\r\nthe Roman yoke until A.D. 426, when the troops were withdrawn to help\r\nValentinian against the Huns, and never returned. When Julius Cæsar\r\nfirst invaded Britain, in the year B.C. 55, he found the inhabitants\r\nfierce and warlike and abundantly supplied with horses and war chariots.\r\nThese chariots were driven with great daring and skill, and the fact\r\nwas thus demonstrated that this kind of warfare was not a new thing to\r\nthe Britons, and that they were not to be easily subdued. The next year\r\nhe returned again, but the second seems to have been no more successful\r\nthan the first expedition. But little is known of the extent of territory\r\noverrun or the result of these invasions beyond the fact that no\r\nsettlement was made then, and none till about ninety years afterward,\r\nwhen under the reign of Claudius, a strong military colony was planted\r\nthere and Britain became a Roman province. During these centuries of\r\nbondage we know practically nothing of the lives of the slaves and but\r\nlittle of their masters, except the remnants of military works for\r\naggression and defence, and the magnificent roads they constructed\r\nwhere-ever they moved their armies. In relation to their horses, I will\r\nmake a few extracts from a work published about the beginning of this\r\ncentury, by Mr. John Lawrence, a man of great research and intelligence,\r\nbesides of a wide acquaintance with the practical affairs of the horse,\r\nand, I may add, altogether the most reliable writer of his period. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    “In forming the paces, if the colt was not naturally of a proud\r\n    and lofty action, like the Spanish or Persian horses, wooden\r\n    rollers and weights were bound to their pastern joints, which\r\n    gave them the habit of lifting up their feet. This method,\r\n    also, was practiced in teaching them the ambulatura, or amble\r\n    (pace), perhaps universally the common traveling pace of the\r\n    Romans.\r\n\r\n    “That natural and most excellent pace, the trot, seems to\r\n    have been very little prized or attended to by the ancients,\r\n    and was, indeed, by the Romans held in a kind of contempt,\r\n    or aversion, as is demonstrated by the terms which served to\r\n    describe it. A trotting horse was called by them _succussator_,\r\n    or shaker, and sometimes _cruciator_, or tormentor, which bad\r\n    terms, it may be presumed, were applied specially to those\r\n    which in these days we dignify with the expressive appellation\r\n    of ‘bone-setters.’”\r\n\r\nThe statuary of the early ages furnishes some excellent illustrations\r\nof the gait of the horse at that period of the world’s history. The\r\nfour bronze horses on St. Mark’s in Venice are known throughout the\r\nworld, and they are in the pacing attitude. The forefoot that is\r\nadvanced is possibly a little too much elevated to strike the ground\r\nthe same instant the hinder foot should strike it, but the whole action\r\nindicated is undoubtedly the lateral action. The date of these horses\r\nis lost in history, but it is supposed they were cast in Rome, about\r\nthe beginning of the Christian era. Their capture in Rome and transfer\r\nto Constantinople, then their capture by the Venetians and transfer to\r\nVenice, next their capture by Napoleon and transfer to Paris, and then\r\ntheir restoration to Venice, are all matters of history.\r\n\r\nWilliam Stephanides, or Fitz Stephen, as he was called, a monk of\r\nCanterbury, was born in London, lived in the reigns of King Stephen,\r\nHenry II., and Richard I., and died 1191. He wrote a description of\r\nLondon in Latin, which was afterward translated by John Strype, and\r\nprinted, from which I take the following extract:\r\n\r\n    “There is without one of the gates, immediately in the suburb,\r\n    a certain smooth field (Smithfield) in name and reality. There\r\n    every Friday, unless it be one of the more solemn festivals, is\r\n    a noted show of well-bred horses exposed for sale. The earls,\r\n    barons and knights who are at the time resident in the city,\r\n    as well as most of the citizens, flock thither either to look\r\n    or to buy. _It is pleasant to see the nags with their sleek\r\n    and shining coats, smoothly ambling (pacing) along, raising\r\n    and setting down, as it were, their feet on either side; in\r\n    one part (of the field) are horses better adapted to the\r\n    esquires; those whose pace is rougher, yet expeditious, lift up\r\n    and set down, as it were, the two opposite fore and hind feet\r\n    (trotting) together._”\r\n\r\nAfter locating and describing the pacers in one part of the field and\r\nthe trotters in another, Fitz Stephen goes on to take a look at the\r\ncolts, then horses of burden, “strong and stout of limb,” and then\r\ntheir chargers in their galloping action. He next gives a very spirited\r\ndescription of the race, when the people raise a shout and all the other\r\nhorses, cattle, etc., are cleared away, that the contestants may have\r\nan unobstructed field. It is a fact worthy of note that every English\r\nwriter on the race horse, for the past century or two, has quoted a part\r\nof the above paragraph from Fitz Stephen as the first known and recorded\r\ninstance of racing in England, but left one of the most important parts\r\nout. Even Mr. Whyte, one of the most prominent of modern writers, in his\r\n“History of the British Turf,” seems to have followed some other writer,\r\nin the omission; or possibly, as he never had seen a pacer in England, he\r\nconcluded that Fitz Stephen had only imagined that he saw, in one part\r\nof the field, horses moving at the lateral gait. In the paragraph quoted\r\nabove, I have italicised that part of the description which English\r\nwriters on turf subjects have omitted with remarkable uniformity.\r\n\r\nThis seems to have been the period in which the pacing horse reached the\r\nhighest point in official and popular appreciation, at least since the\r\ndays of the Roman occupation of Britain. In speaking of this period,\r\nMr. Lawrence says: “All descriptions of saddle horses were taught to\r\namble” (that did not amble naturally), “and that most excellent and\r\nuseful gait, the trot, was almost entirely disused.” In addition to the\r\nevidence of Fitz Stephen, we have that furnished by the Great Seals of\r\na succession of sovereigns commencing with Richard I., and continuing\r\nto Elizabeth. These seals represent a knight in armor, mounted on a\r\npacing horse in action, and perhaps the most conspicuous, at least the\r\nclearest, impression that has come down to us is that of King John, used\r\nat Runnymede, when he yielded to the demands of his barons and granted\r\nthe Magna Charta. This act secured the liberties of the Anglo-Saxon race\r\nfor all time and in all climes.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Blundeville was, probably, the first writer on the horse who\r\nundertook to publish a book in the English language on that subject.\r\nThis book, entitled “The Art of Riding,” was merely a translation from\r\nthe Italian, with some brief observations on English horses added to it.\r\nThe first edition, it is said, was published in London, 1558, the year\r\nthat Queen Elizabeth ascended the throne. The only edition which I have\r\nbeen able to find in the British Museum is that of 1580, in old English\r\nblack letter. In quoting from the old authors of that period I will seek\r\nto avoid confusion by using the modern orthography. In speaking of the\r\nhorses of his day he says:\r\n\r\n    “Some men would have a breed of great trotting horses meet for\r\n    the war and to serve in the field. Some others again would have\r\n    a breed of ambling horses of a mean stature for to journey and\r\n    travel by the way. Some, again, would have a race of swift\r\n    runners to run for wagers or to gallop the buck, or to serve\r\n    for such like exercise for pleasure. But the plain countryman\r\n    would have a breed only for draft or burthen.\r\n\r\n    “The Irish Hobbie is a pretty fine horse, having a good head\r\n    and a body indifferently well proportioned, saving that many\r\n    of them be slender and pin-buttocked. They are tender-mouthed,\r\n    nimble, pleasant and apt to be taught, and for the most part\r\n    they be amblers and thus very meet for the saddle and to travel\r\n    by the way. Yea, and the Irishmen, both with darts and light\r\n    spears, do use to skirmish with them in the field, and many of\r\n    them do prove to that use very well, by means they be so light\r\n    and swift.\r\n\r\n    “Let those mares that shall be put to the stallion be of a high\r\n    stature, strongly made, large and fair, and have a trotting\r\n    pace as the mares of Flanders and some of our own mares be. For\r\n    it is not meet, for divers reasons, that horses of [service\r\n    stallions] should amble. But if any man seeks to have a race\r\n    of ambling horses, to travel by the way, then I would wish his\r\n    stallion to be a fair jennet of Spain, or at least a bastard\r\n    jennet, or else a fair Irish ambling Hobbie; and the mare to be\r\n    also a bastard jennet, bred here within this realm, having an\r\n    ambling pace, or else some other of our ambling mares, so that\r\n    the mare be well proportioned. And if any man desires to have\r\n    swift runners let him choose a horse of Barbary or a Turk to be\r\n    his stallion, and let the mare, which shall be put unto him,\r\n    be like of stature and making unto him, so nigh as may be, for\r\n    most commonly, such sire and dam such colt.”\r\n\r\nIt is evident Mr. Blundeville was not much of a friend of the pacer, but\r\nas an honest writer he considers things as he finds them. Unfortunately\r\nhe throws no light upon just what he means by the term “Spanish Jennet,”\r\nand a definition of that term, as used in the sixteenth century, would\r\nthrow much light on passages from following writers in later periods.\r\nEverybody knows he was a small Spanish saddle horse, but nobody knows\r\njust what gait he took. To use Blundevilles own language, “The pace of\r\nthe jennet of Spain is neither trot nor amble, but a comely kind of going\r\nlike the Turke.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gervaise Markham published several revised and enlarged editions of\r\nhis work on the horse, the last of which I have been able to examine\r\nbeing printed in London, 1607, the same year the colony was planted at\r\nJamestown, Virginia. In this edition he devotes nine short chapters or\r\nparagraphs to the pacer. In quoting from him I will again use the modern\r\nmethods of spelling. He says:\r\n\r\n    “First to speak of ambling in general. It is that smooth and\r\n    easy pace which the labor and industry of an ingenious brain\r\n    hath found out to relieve the aged, sick, impotent and diseased\r\n    persons, to make women undertake journeying and so by their\r\n    community to grace society; to make great men try the ease of\r\n    travel, more willing to thrust themselves into the offices of\r\n    the commonwealth, and to do the poor both relief and service.\r\n    It makes them when necessity, or as the proverb is, “when\r\n    the devil drives,” not to be vexed with the two torments, a\r\n    troubled mind and a tormented body. To conclude, ambling was\r\n    found out for the general ease of the whole world, as long as\r\n    there is either pleasure, commerce or trade amongst the people.\r\n    Now for the manner of the motion and the difference betwixt\r\n    it and trotting. It cannot be described more plainly than I\r\n    have set down in my former treatise; which is that it is the\r\n    taking up of both legs together upon one side and so carrying\r\n    them smoothly along to set them down upon the ground even\r\n    together, and in that motion he must lift and wind up his fore\r\n    foot somewhat high from the ground, but his hinder foot he must\r\n    no more than take from the ground, as it were, sweep it close\r\n    to the earth. Now, by taking up both his legs together on one\r\n    side, I mean he must take up his right fore foot and his right\r\n    hinder foot. For, as in the contrary pace, when a horse trots\r\n    he takes up his feet crosswise, as the left hinder foot and the\r\n    right fore foot, etc.”\r\n\r\nMr. Markham, in his edition of 1607, then goes on in six or eight\r\nchapters acknowledging that many foals pace naturally, and to show how\r\nthe foal may be trained to pace. His methods are very cruel, in many\r\ncases, and very crude throughout; but it clearly demonstrates the fact\r\nthat in the sixteenth century the pace was a very general gait among\r\nEnglish horses. In these chapters we find the toe weight first introduced\r\nas well as the trammels or hopples. The most striking fact brought out in\r\nthese chapters is the discovery that more than three hundred years ago\r\nEnglishmen were using the same devices to convert trotters into pacers\r\nthat we are now using to convert pacers into trotters. He takes notice\r\nthat Mr. Blundeville had advised those who wished to breed amblers to\r\nselect a Spanish jennet or an Irish Hobbie, and objects to the former on\r\nthe grounds that their paces are weak and uncertain. From this I conclude\r\nthat the gait of the jennet, whatever it might have been, was not a habit\r\nof action fixed in the breed, and that its transmission was doubtful.\r\n\r\nMr. Markham then goes on further to explain the mechanism of the trot\r\nand the pace and incidentally introduces the rack or single-foot action,\r\nwhich, I think, is the first time I have found it in any English writer.\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n    “The nearer a horse taketh his limbs from the ground, the\r\n    opener and evener and the shorter he treadeth, the better will\r\n    be his pace, and the contrary declares much imperfection. If\r\n    you buy a horse for pleasure the amble is the best, in which\r\n    you observe that he moves both his legs on one side together\r\n    neat with complete deliberation, for if he treads too short\r\n    he is apt to stumble, if too large to cut and if shuffling or\r\n    rowling he does it slovenly, and besides rids no ground. If\r\n    your horse be designed for hunting, a racking pace is most\r\n    expedient, which little differs from the amble, only is more\r\n    active and nimble, whereby the horse observes due motion, but\r\n    you must not force him too eagerly, lest being in confusion he\r\n    lose all knowledge of what you design him to, and so handle his\r\n    legs confusedly. The gallop is requisite for race horses....\r\n    If he gallop round and raise his fore legs he is then said to\r\n    gallop strongly, but not capable of much speed, and is fitter\r\n    for the war than racing.”\r\n\r\nIn 1667 the Duke of Newcastle published his famous work on the horse\r\nunder the title, “A New Method and Extraordinary Invention to Dress\r\nHorses, and Work them According to Nature and also To Perfect Nature by\r\nthe Subtilty of Art which was Never Found Out, but by the Thrice Noble,\r\nHigh, and Puissant Prince, William Cavendish, Duke, Marquess, and Earl of\r\nNewcastle, etc., etc.,” followed with twelve other titles and offices.\r\nThe book was dedicated to “His Most Sacred Majesty, Charles the Second,”\r\nand is pretentious and magniloquent in its letter press and its make-up\r\nas it is in its title. In this work there is a great deal of bad English,\r\nsome sense, and much nonsense, all mixed up with a strut of superiority\r\nthat His Grace, no doubt, felt justified in enjoying after his long\r\nyears of beggary in Antwerp. In giving the _natural_ gaits of the horse\r\nhe places the walk first, then the trot and next the amble, which he\r\ndescribes very minutely as follows:\r\n\r\n    “For an amble he removes both his legs of a side, as, for\r\n    example, take the far side, he removes his fore leg and his\r\n    hinder leg at one time, whilst the other two legs of the near\r\n    side stand still; and when those legs are on the ground, which\r\n    he first removed, at the same time they are upon the ground\r\n    the other side, which is the nearer side, removes fore leg and\r\n    hinder leg on that side, and the other legs of the far side\r\n    stand still. Thus an amble removes both his legs of a side and\r\n    every remove changes sides; two of a side in the air and two\r\n    upon the ground at the same time. And this is a perfect amble.”\r\n\r\nThe duke seems to have been somewhat profuse in the use of words, and\r\nnot very happy in his use of them, but after all we know just what he\r\nmeans. The description of the movement is that of the clean-cut pace, and\r\nour object in introducing it here is not only to show that the pace was\r\nthen a well-known and natural gait in England, but also to show that the\r\n_pace_ and the _amble_ are one. In itself, the word “amble” is a better\r\nword than “pace,” for the latter is often used in referring to a rate of\r\nspeed without regard to the particular gait taken by the horse, but in\r\nthis country it is now universally understood to apply to the lateral\r\nmotion, and it would not be wise at this day to attempt to change it.\r\nThere is an undefined supposition in the mind of some people that the\r\namble is something different from the pace, that it is a slower and\r\nless pronounced gait, and hence we are often told a given horse did not\r\npace, but “he ambled off.” In all that we have found in the writings of\r\nthe past, and in all that I have seen with my own eyes, I have not been\r\nable to discover that there is any distinction between the amble and the\r\npace. The only distinction is not in the gait itself, but in the fact\r\nthat our ancestors, four hundred years ago, used the word “amble” to\r\nexpress precisely the same thing that their descendants now express by\r\nthe word “pace.” The only sense in which the word “amble” is used among\r\nthe horsemen of this country is to describe a kind of slow, incipient\r\npace that many horses, both runners and trotters, show when recalled for\r\na fresh start in scoring for a race. This probably indicates, whether\r\nin the case of a runner or a trotter, that somewhere, not very far\r\nremoved, there is a pacing inheritance, and this incipient amble, as it\r\nis sometimes called, comes from that inheritance. It is also possible\r\nthat it may arise from the excitement of the start and the confusion\r\nconsequent upon the contest.\r\n\r\nAt the close of Queen Elizabeth’s reign, about the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, the pacing horse of England was at the highest point\r\nof his utility and fame. He was the horse for the race course, he was\r\nthe horse for the hunting field, and he was the horse for the saddle. He\r\nwas able to beat King James’ Arabian, and with the few Barbs that had\r\nthen been brought in, the historian informs us, he was able to hold his\r\nown. There were two tribes of his congeners, the Galloway and the Irish\r\nHobbie, the former from Southwestern Scotland and the north of England,\r\nand the latter from Ireland. These tribes were chiefly pacers, and not a\r\nfew of them were distinguished as running horses. The Bald Galloway, as\r\nhe was called, was a grand representative of his tribe. He was simply a\r\nnative pony with a bald face, and he was a capital runner for his day,\r\nand a number of his get were distinguished runners. True, he is tricked\r\nout in the Stud Book with a pedigree, wholly fictitious, and that nobody\r\never heard of for a hundred years after he was foaled, but that did\r\nnot prevent his daughter Roxana, when bred to Godolphin Arabian, from\r\nproducing two of his greatest sons, Lath and Cade. This topic, however,\r\nhas already been considered in the chapter on the English Race Horse.\r\nThe Galloways were very famous as pacers in their day, and it seems they\r\nwere about the last remnants of the pacing tribes to be found in England.\r\nIt seems, also, that long after they had ceased to be known on the\r\nother side their descendants were still known by the same designation in\r\nVirginia. From the history of the times, it appears that a wealthy Irish\r\ngentleman invested quite largely in shipping live stock to Virginia, and\r\nthere can hardly be a doubt that his shipments included some of the Irish\r\nHobbies.\r\n\r\nWhile the opening of the seventeenth century witnessed the supremacy of\r\nthe English pacer, in the uses and enjoyments of the lives of the people,\r\nduring the whole course of its succeeding years he was battling for his\r\nexistence, and at its close he was nearly extinct. At the close of Queen\r\nAnne’s reign there were still a few Galloways left, but in the early\r\nGeorges there were no longer any survivors, and Great Britain was without\r\na pacer in the whole realm. The extinction of a race of horses that had\r\nbeen the delight of the kings, queens, nobility, and gentry of a great\r\nnation for many centuries is, perhaps, without a precedent in the history\r\nof any civilized people, and the causes which produced this wonderful\r\nresult are well worthy of careful study. In looking into these causes we\r\nmust consider the facts as we find them.\r\n\r\nAs we have no guide, either historic, linguistic or ethnographic, by\r\nwhich we can certainly determine the blood of the original inhabitants\r\nof the British Isles, it is not remarkable that we should be in profound\r\nignorance as to the blood of their horses. They were, doubtless, like\r\ntheir masters, of mixed origin, and through all the centuries their\r\nappearance would indicate that they have been bred and reared in a\r\nnomadic or semi-wild state, in which only the toughest and fleetest\r\nhad survived. A good many years ago I met with a theory, advanced by\r\nsomebody, that the original horse stock of Britain came from the North,\r\nbut there were no reasons given to support it. I have no hesitation in\r\naccepting this theory, as far as it distinguishes between the North\r\nand the South, for some Northern countries produce vast numbers of\r\nnatural pacers, as Russia, for instance, but I have never learned that\r\nany Southern country produced pacers. Certainly the shaft horse of\r\nthe Russian drosky has been a flying pacer for generations, and great\r\nnumbers of them are produced in Russia, especially in the eastern part\r\nof the empire. As these pacers are produced in a natural and semi-wild\r\nstate, it must be conceded that habits of action have been inherited\r\nfrom their ancestors in the remote past. Historically, we know that\r\nthe Phœnicians, when they ruled the trade of the world, supplied the\r\nwhole of the northern coast of Africa, from Egypt to Algiers, and the\r\nsouthern coast of Spain, with horses, about a thousand years before the\r\nChristian era. Now, the horses of those regions are the descendants of\r\nthe original stock carried there by the Phœnicians, and we know their\r\nhabit of action is not that of the pacer. Hence the conclusion that the\r\nEnglish pacer came from the North and not from the South. In speaking of\r\nthe difference in the gaits of Northern and Southern horses, Mr. John\r\nLawrence specifies the horses of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, etc., and says:\r\n“They are round made, but with clean heads and limbs; their best pace\r\nis the trot (or pace), which indeed is the characteristic pace of the\r\nNorthern, as the gallop is of the Southern horse.” Other writers speak\r\nof the trot (or pace) as common to Northern horses, but as not common\r\nto Southern horses. Now, as all Southern horses do trot, and as these\r\nwriters could not fail to know that they trotted, at some rate of speed,\r\nwe must construe their terms so as to be consistent with plain, common\r\nsense. There was something in the “trot” of the Northern horse altogether\r\ndifferent from the “trot” of the Southern horse that rendered his habit\r\nof action more conspicuous, probably by his higher rate of speed, but\r\nstill more probably by the peculiar mechanism of his lateral action. If\r\nwe insert the word “pace” instead of the word “trot,” the meaning of\r\nthese old writers becomes very plain and in harmony with other known\r\nfacts. Neither does it militate against the theory that the inhabitants\r\nof Britain may have secured their original horse stock from the Phœnician\r\nmerchants; but if they did, it seems quite evident that at a later date\r\nthey supplemented their supply from the pacing element from the North.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the fifteenth century Polydore Virgil, an Italian\r\necclesiastic, came to England and wrote a descriptive history of the\r\nBritish Islands in Latin, which was published about 1509. Part of\r\nthis history was very clumsily translated about the time the English\r\nlanguage began to assume its present form in literature and learning.\r\nIn speaking of the horses of the country, he seems to have been greatly\r\nsurprised with the pacers, and treats them as a curiosity. He says: “A\r\ngreat company of their horses do not trot, but amble, and yet neither\r\ntrotters nor amblers are strongest, as strength is not always incident\r\nto that which is most gentle or less courageous.” It will be observed\r\nthat these observations were made nearly four hundred years ago, and that\r\nthe surprise of the Italian was not at merely seeing a few pacers which\r\nhe had never seen in his own country, but that “the great company” of\r\nEnglish horses were pacers. As I have here given an instance showing the\r\nsurprise of an Italian at finding pacers, I will follow it with another\r\nshowing the surprise of an Englishman at not finding any pacers. The\r\nchaplain of the Earl of Cumberland, on his several voyages of discovery\r\nin South America and the West India Islands, about 1596, made elaborate\r\nnote of what he saw and learned of the new countries which the English\r\nthen visited for the first time. These notes passed into the hands of\r\nthat wonderfully prolific writer, or rather compiler, Samuel Purchas,\r\nfrom whose fourth volume, page 1171, the following paragraph is taken:\r\n\r\n    “And I wot not how that kind of beast [speaking of cattle]\r\n    hath specially a liking to these Southerly parts of the world\r\n    above their horses, none of which I have seen by much so tall\r\n    and goodly as ordinarily they are in England; they were well\r\n    made and well mettled, and good store there are of them, but\r\n    methinks there are many things wanting in them which are\r\n    ordinary in our English light horses. They are all trotters,\r\n    nor do I remember that I have seen above one ambler, and that\r\n    was a little fiddling nag. But it may be if there were better\r\n    breeders they would have better and more useful increase, yet\r\n    they are good enough for hackneys, to which use only almost\r\n    they are employed.”\r\n\r\nThe surprise of the Englishman at finding no pacers in South America\r\nseems to have been as great as that of the Italian at finding so many of\r\nthem in England, one hundred years earlier. These horses were strictly\r\nSpanish, and probably were descended from those brought from Palos in\r\n1493 by Columbus, the first horses that ever crossed the Atlantic. The\r\n“one little fiddling nag” that showed some kind of a pacing gait may have\r\nbeen of English blood and captured from some English expedition, several\r\nof which were unfortunate; or his failure to trot may have been the\r\nresult of an injury. It should not be forgotten that in that period every\r\nsea captain was out for what he could capture, and this was especially\r\nthe case as between the English and the Spanish. These are the outlines\r\nof the principal points of evidence that the pacing habit of action came\r\nfrom the North and not from the South. That there were pacers in both\r\nGreece and Rome before the Christian era, and perhaps later, there can be\r\nno doubt, for they were both overrun and devastated again and again by\r\nthe hordes of Northern Barbarians, bringing their flocks and their herds\r\nand their families, as well as their horses, with them.\r\n\r\nThis question naturally suggests itself here: “If the English pacer had\r\nbeen the popular favorite of the English people for so many centuries,\r\nhow did it come that he and his habit of action had been so completely\r\nwiped out in one century, the seventeenth?” This question might be\r\nanswered in very few words, by saying the people thought they were\r\ngetting something better to put in his place. In reaching this conclusion\r\nI will not pretend to say the judgment of the people was not right, that\r\nis, if they exercised any judgment in the case. “Jamie the Scotsman”\r\nwhen on the throne set the fashion in the direction of foreign blood\r\nby paying the enormous price of five hundred pounds for the Markham\r\nArabian. The Duke of Newcastle, when he was young, had personally seen\r\nthis horse, and while he thought he was a true Arabian, he described him\r\nas a very ordinary horse in his size and form, and an entire failure as\r\na race horse. It seems that any average native pacer could outrun him,\r\nbut he carried the badge of royalty, and that was sufficient to make him\r\nfashionable, as he was not only the king’s horse, but was himself a royal\r\nArabian. The weak place in the character of James I., in addition to his\r\nintolerable pedantry, was his inordinate ambition to be considered the\r\nwisest sovereign who ever sat upon a throne since the days of Solomon.\r\nHis courtiers, nobility, and all who approached him understood his\r\nweakness, and a little quiet praise of the great superiority of the\r\nArabian blood in the horse, over all other breeds and varieties, was\r\nalways grateful to the monarch, for he was the original discoverer and\r\npatentee of that blood. Then and there, in order to praise the wisdom\r\nof a foolish king, a foolish fashion grew into a foolish notion that\r\nhas afflicted all England from that day to this. No humbug of either\r\nancient or modern times has had so long a run and so wide a range as\r\nthe miserable fallacy “that all excellence in the horse comes from the\r\nArabian.” Notwithstanding the thousand tests that have been made and the\r\nthousand failures that have invariably followed, from the time of King\r\nJames to the present day, there are still men writing books and magazine\r\narticles on the assumption that “all excellence in the horse comes from\r\nthe Arabian,” without ever having devoted an honest hour to the study of\r\nthe question as to whether this is a truth or a fallacy. This craze for\r\nArabian blood was the primary cause of the extinction of the pacer, and\r\nthis craze was so strong in its influence that when a foreign horse was\r\nbrought in, no difference from what country, if he were of the lighter\r\ntype he was called an Arabian and so advertised in order to secure\r\nthe patronage of breeders. Horses brought from the African coast were\r\ninvariably classed as Arabians, notwithstanding they and their ancestors\r\nwere in Africa more than a thousand years before there were any horses in\r\nArabia; and the same may be said of Spain. But as this line of inquiry\r\nhas already been considered in another chapter, I will get back to the\r\nimmediate topic.\r\n\r\nThe process of breeding out the pacer did not commence in real earnest\r\nuntil the middle of the seventeenth century, when the Stuarts regained\r\nthe sovereignty of Great Britain in the person of Charles II. Released\r\nfrom the restraints of Puritan rule, the Restoration brought with it a\r\ncarnival of immorality and vice, for the court and the courtiers set the\r\nfashion and the people followed. As the breeding interest of the period\r\nof which we now speak has already been considered in the chapter on the\r\nEnglish Race Horse, I will not further enlarge upon it. The light, or\r\nrunning and hunting, horses of England of that day were not all pacers,\r\nbut they were all of the same type and the same blood, hence when I\r\nspeak of the pacers I include their congeners. They were small—less than\r\nfourteen hands high—and not generally handsome and attractive. In general\r\nutility they were ahead of the importations, and doubtless many of them\r\ncould run as fast and as far as the foreign horses, but the foreigners\r\nhad the advantage in size, especially the Turks and the Neapolitans;\r\nbesides this, they were more uniformly handsome and attractive in their\r\nform and carriage. It is also probable that the outcross from the\r\nstrangers to invigorate the stock was needed and resulted in the increase\r\nof the size of the progeny. This latter suggestion is inferential and has\r\nbeen sustained by many similar experiences, but without this as a start\r\nit would be exceedingly difficult to account for the rapid increase in\r\nthe height of the English race horse. It is certainly true that the chief\r\naim of the English breeder of that day was to increase the size, without\r\nlosing symmetry and style, and if he found that foreign upon native blood\r\ngave him a start in that direction, he was wise in the commingling.\r\nAnother consideration, growing out of the rural economy of the people,\r\ndoubtless had a very wide influence in the direction of wiping out the\r\npacer, in this period of transition. Long journeys in the saddle became\r\nless frequent, good roads began to appear and vehicles on wheels took\r\nthe place of the saddler and the pack horse. To get greater weight and\r\nstrength for this service, recourse was had to crosses with the larger\r\nand courser breeds, and through these channels have come the giants and\r\nthe pigmies of the modern race course. Under the changed conditions of\r\ntravel and transportation it is not remarkable that the people should\r\nhave been willing to see their long-time favorites disappear, for it\r\nis known to every man of experience that the pace is not a desirable\r\ngait for harness work. No doubt the pacer is as strong as the trotter\r\nof the same size and make-up, but in his smooth, gliding motion there\r\nis a suggestion of weakness communicated to his driver that is never\r\nsuggested by the bold, bounding trotter. The antagonism between the\r\npacers and the new horses of Saracenic origin was irreconcilable and\r\none or the other had to yield. As the management of the contest was in\r\nthe hands of the master the result could be easily foreseen, for if one\r\ncross failed, another followed and then another, till the Saracenic blood\r\nwas completely dominant in eliminating the lateral and implanting the\r\ndiagonal action in its stead.\r\n\r\nAs no home-bred pacer, of any type or breed, has been seen in England for\r\nnearly two hundred years, it is not remarkable that Englishmen of good\r\naverage intelligence, for the past two or three generations, have lived\r\nand died supposing they knew all about horses, and yet did not know there\r\nhad ever been such a thing in England as a breed of pacing horses. When,\r\nsome eighteen or twenty years ago, I called the attention of Mr. H. F.\r\nEuren, compiler of the Hackney Stud Book, to the early English pacers as\r\na most inviting field in which to look for the origin of the “Norfolk\r\nTrotters,” he was surprised to learn that such horses had existed in\r\nEngland, but he went to work and gathered up many important facts that\r\nappear in the first volume of the Hackney compilation. Many of these\r\nfacts, but in less detail, had already appeared, from time to time,\r\nin _Wallace’s Monthly_, but Mr. Euren’s was the first modern English\r\npublication to place them before English readers. From this prompting,\r\nMr. Euren did well, but we must go back a little to see how this subject\r\nwas treated by English writers of horse books, who wrote without any\r\npromptings from this side.\r\n\r\nMr. William Youatt was a voluminous writer on domestic animals, and at\r\none time was looked upon as the highest authority on the horse, both\r\nin England and in this country. He seems to have been a practitioner of\r\nveterinary surgery, and from the number of volumes which he published\r\nsuccessfully, he must have been a man of ability and education. There can\r\nbe no question that he knew a great deal—quite too much to know anything\r\nwell. The first edition of his work on the horse was published in 1831,\r\nand soon after its appearance several publishing houses in this country\r\nseized upon it as very valuable, and each one of them soon had an edition\r\nof it before the public. It purports to have been written at the instance\r\nof “The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.” This declaration\r\nwas a good thing, in a commercial view, and no doubt it did much in\r\nextending the circulation of the book. Without tarrying to note several\r\nminor historical blunders, I will go direct to one relating to the gait\r\nof the horse, which is now under consideration. In his fourth edition,\r\npage 535, he incidentally discusses the mechanism of the pace, and after\r\nspeaking of the Elgin Marbles, to which I have referred at the beginning\r\nof this chapter, and after conceding that two of the four horses are not\r\ngalloping but pacing, he says:\r\n\r\n    “Whether this was then the mode of trotting or not, it is\r\n    certain that it is never seen to occur in nature in the\r\n    present day; and, indeed, it appears quite inconsistent with\r\n    the necessary balancing of the body, and was, therefore, more\r\n    probably an error of the artist.”\r\n\r\nThis remark is simply amazing in an author who pretentiously undertakes\r\nto instruct his countrymen in the history of the horse when he knows\r\nnothing about that history. If he had gone back only twenty-two years,\r\n“Old John Lawrence,” in his splendid quarto, would have told him about\r\nthe pacer. If he had gone back one hundred and sixty years, the Duke of\r\nNewcastle would have explained to him the complete and perfect mechanism\r\nof the pacing gait. If he had gone still further back and examined\r\nGervaise Markham, Blundeville, Polydore Virgil, and Fitz Stephen the\r\nMonk, of the twelfth century, any and all of them would have explained\r\nto him the pacing habit of action and shown him that for many successive\r\ncenturies the pacing horse was the popular and fashionable horse of\r\nthe realm. If Mr. Youatt had lived to see John R. Gentry pace a mile\r\nin 2:00½; Robert J. in 2:01½, and dozens of others in less than 2:10,\r\nhe might have changed his mind and concluded that it was possible,\r\nafter all, for a horse to travel at the lateral gait without toppling\r\nover. From Mr. Youatt and a few other modern English authors, most\r\nof our American writers on the horse have derived what little mental\r\npabulum they thought they needed, and thus an error at the fountain has\r\nbeen carried into all the ramifications of our horse literature. Only\r\ntwo or three years ago a very intelligent gentleman, who had attained\r\ngreat eminence as a veterinary surgeon, especially for his knowledge\r\nand treatment of the horse’s foot, seriously and in good faith stoutly\r\nmaintained that the pacing habit of action was merely the result of an\r\nabnormal condition of the foot, and that all pacers would trot just as\r\nsoon as their feet were put in the right shape. We must not laugh at\r\nthis wild notion, for it is really no worse than Mr. Youatt’s doubting\r\nwhether it was possible for a horse to balance himself at the lateral\r\nmotion. Neither gentleman seemed to know anything about the fact that\r\nit was a matter of inheritance, and that the lateral habit of action\r\nhad come down by transmission through all the generations for a period\r\nof more than two thousand years. It is hardly necessary to say that the\r\ngentleman who was so confident that the pace was merely the result of the\r\nabnormal condition of the feet brought his notions about the pacer from\r\nacross the water. He was an Anglo-American, and could make a pacer into\r\na trotter in a jiffy, by using the paring-knife. He was an intelligent\r\nman and a skillful veterinarian, but there were no pacers in England\r\nand there should be none here. Toward the close of the chapter on The\r\nColonial Horses of Virginia, will be found the observations of an English\r\ntourist in 1795-96 who is very certain that there is some mistake about\r\nthe pacer, and will not be convinced there are any, unless they are\r\nartificially created. Having now completed what I had to say about the\r\nold English pacer, it is next in order to consider his descendants in\r\nthis country and the relations they bear to the American trotter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN PACER AND HIS RELATIONS TO THE AMERICAN TROTTER.\r\n\r\n    Regulations against stallions at large—American pacers taken\r\n    to the West Indies—Narragansett pacers; many foolish and\r\n    groundless theories about their origin—Dr. McSparran on the\r\n    speed of the pacer—Mr. Updike’s testimony—Mr. Hazard and\r\n    Mr. Enoch Lewis—Exchanging meetings with Virginia—Watson’s\r\n    Annals—Matlack and Acrelius—Rip Van Dam’s horse—Cooper’s\r\n    evidence—Cause of disappearance—Banished to the frontier—First\r\n    intimation that the pace and the trot were essentially one\r\n    gait—How it was received—Analysis of the two gaits—Pelham,\r\n    Highland Maid, Jay-Eye-See, Blue Bull—The pacer forces\r\n    himself into publicity—Higher rate of speed—Pacing races\r\n    very early—Quietly and easily developed—Comes to his speed\r\n    quickly—His present eminence not permanent—The gamblers carried\r\n    him there—Will he return to his former obscurity?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the several chapters devoted to “Colonial Horse History” will be\r\nfound all the leading facts that I have been able to glean from the\r\nearly sources of information. With the exceptions of the horses brought\r\nfrom Utrecht in Holland to New Amsterdam (New York), two shiploads that\r\nsailed out of the Zuider Zee and landed at Salem, Massachusetts, and\r\nthose brought from Sweden by the colonists that settled on the Delaware,\r\nall the early importations came from England. As much the larger number\r\nof those from England and Sweden were pacers, the breeds and habits of\r\naction were soon mixed up, as those who had no pacers wanted pacers for\r\nthe saddle, and those who wanted more size, regardless of the gait,\r\nwere always ready to supply their want by an exchange of their saddle\r\nhorses for more size. The Dutch horses were certainly something over\r\nfourteen hands and the English and Swedish horses were perhaps nearer\r\nthirteen than fourteen hands. The colonists from the first, and from one\r\nend of the land to the other, seem to have appreciated the importance\r\nof increasing the size and strength of their horse stock, and this was\r\nvery hard to do under the conditions then prevailing of allowing their\r\nhorses to roam at large. Hence, stringent regulations were adopted in\r\nall the colonies against permitting immature entire colts and stallions\r\nunder size to wander where they pleased. It is doubtful whether these\r\nregulations were any more effective than those of Henry VIII., for while\r\nthere was some increase, it was hardly perceptible until after the close\r\nof the colonial days. The real increase did not commence till the farmers\r\nhad provided themselves with facilities for keeping their breeding stock\r\nat home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN R. GENTRY.\r\n\r\nBy Ashland Wilkes, pacing record 2:00½, 1896.]\r\n\r\nIt is very evident from the statistics of size and gait, as given in\r\nthe chapters referred to above, that our forefathers wisely selected\r\nthe most compact, strong and hardy animals they could find in England\r\nas the type best adapted to fight their way against the hardships of a\r\nlife in the wilderness of the new world. There have been some attempts,\r\nwholly fanciful and baseless, to trace importations from other countries,\r\noutside of those mentioned above, but all such attempts have proven\r\nwholly imaginary and worse than futile. In less than twenty years after\r\nthe New England colonies received their first supply they commenced\r\nshipping horses by the cargo to Barbadoes and other West India Islands.\r\nThis trade was cultivated, extended to all the islands, and continued\r\nduring the remainder of the seventeenth and practically the whole of the\r\neighteenth century. The pacers of the American colonies were exceedingly\r\npopular and sought after by the Spanish as well as the Dutch and English\r\nislands. Indeed, the planters of Cuba alone carried away at high prices\r\nnearly all the pacers that New England could produce. They knew nothing\r\nabout pacers for the saddle until they had tried them and then they\r\nwould have nothing else. These continuous raids of the Spaniards of the\r\nWest Indies upon the pacers of New England, and Rhode Island especially,\r\nhas been assigned, by the local historians of that State as one of the\r\nprincipal causes of the decadence and practically final disappearance of\r\nthe Narragansett pacer from the seat of his triumphs and his fame. It\r\nis just to remark here, in passing, that if there had been pacers among\r\nthe horses of Spain, the Spanish dependencies would have secured their\r\nsupplies from the mother country and not have come to Rhode Island and\r\npaid fabulous prices for them.\r\n\r\nAs all the pacing traditions of this country to-day point to the\r\nhorses of Narragansett Bay as the source from which our modern pacers\r\nhave derived their speed, we must give some attention to the various\r\ntheories that have been advanced as to the origin of the Narragansett\r\nhorse. In time past, and extending back to a period “whereof the memory\r\nof man runneth not to the contrary,” the horse world has been cursed\r\nwith a class of men who have always been ready to invent and put in\r\ncirculation the most marvelous and incredible stories about the origin of\r\nevery remarkable horse that has appeared. Some of these wiseacres have\r\nmaintained that the original Narragansett pacer was caught wild in the\r\nwoods by the first settlers on Narragansett Bay, while others (and this\r\nseems to be of Canadian origin) have insisted that when being brought to\r\nthis country a storm struck the ship and the horse was thrown overboard,\r\nand after nine days he was found off the coast of Newfoundland quietly\r\neating rushes on a sand bar, where he was rescued and brought into\r\nNarragansett Bay. This story of the marine horse probably had its origin\r\nin the experiences of Rip Van Dam, which will be narrated further on.\r\nAnother representation, coming this time from a very reputable source,\r\nhas been made as to the origin of the Narragansett horse, and as many, no\r\ndoubt, have accepted it as true, I must give it such consideration as its\r\nprominence demands. Mr. I. T. Hazard, a representative of the very old\r\nand prominent Hazard family of Rhode Island, in a letter to the Rev. Mr.\r\nUpdike, makes the following statement:\r\n\r\n    “My grandfather, Governor Robinson, introduced the famous\r\n    saddle horse, the Narragansett pacer, known in the last century\r\n    over all the civilized parts of North America and the West\r\n    Indies, from whence they have lately been introduced into\r\n    England, as a ladies’ saddle horse, under the name of the\r\n    Spanish Jennet. Governor Robinson imported the original from\r\n    Andalusia, in Spain, and the raising of them for the West India\r\n    market was one of the objects of the early planters of this\r\n    country. My grandfather, Robert Hazard, raised about a hundred\r\n    of them annually, and often loaded two vessels a year with\r\n    them, and other products of his farm, which sailed direct from\r\n    the South Ferry to the West Indies, where they were in great\r\n    demand.”\r\n\r\nThis theory of the origin of the Narragansett came down to Mr. Hazard\r\nas a tradition, no doubt, but like a thousand other traditions it has\r\nnothing to sustain it. Opposed to it there are two clearly ascertained\r\nfacts, either one of which is wholly fatal to it. In the first place,\r\nthere were no pacers in Andalusia or any other part of Spain, and in the\r\nsecond place, these horses, according to official data, were the leading\r\nitem of export from Rhode Island in 1680, and Governor Robinson was not\r\nborn till about 1693. As impossibilities admit of no argument, I will\r\nnot add another word to this “Andalusian” origin tradition, except to\r\nsay that a hundred years later, when the pacing dam of Sherman Morgan\r\nwas taken from Cranston, Rhode Island, up into Vermont, she was called\r\na “Spanish mare,” because Mr. Hazard had said the original Narragansett\r\nhad come from Spain. The story of the descendants of the Narragansetts\r\nhaving been carried from the West Indies to England, and there introduced\r\nunder the name of the Spanish Jennet as a lady’s saddle horse, is wholly\r\nimaginative. The Spanish Jennet, whatever its gait may have been, was\r\nwell known in England many years before the first horse was brought to\r\nany of the American colonies. (See extracts from Blundeville and Markham\r\nin Chapter XII.)\r\n\r\nAfter several years of fruitless search for some trace of the early\r\nimportations of horses into the colony of Rhode Island, I have reached\r\nthe conclusion that probably no such importations were ever made. The\r\ncolony of Massachusetts Bay commenced importing horses and other live\r\nstock from England in 1629, and continued to do so for several years\r\nand until they were fully supplied, as stated above. In 1640 a shipload\r\nof horses were exported to the Barbadoes, and it was about this time\r\nthat Rhode Island began to assume an organized existence. Her people\r\nwere largely made up of refugees from the religious intolerance of the\r\nother New England colonies, and they brought their families and effects,\r\nincluding their horses, with them. The blood of the Narragansett pacer,\r\ntherefore, was not different from the blood of the pacers of the other\r\ncolonies, but the development of his speed by the establishment of a\r\npacing course and the offering of valuable prizes, naturally brought the\r\nbest and the fastest horses to this colony and from the best and fastest\r\nthey built up a breed that became famous throughout all the inhabited\r\nportions of the Western Hemisphere. The race track, with the valuable\r\nprizes it offered and the emulation it aroused, was what did it. As the\r\nquestion of origin is thus settled in accordance with what is known of\r\nhistory and the natural order of things, and as the Narragansett is the\r\ngreat tribe representing the lateral action then and since, we must\r\nconsider such details of history as have come down to us.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. James McSparran, D.D., was sent out by the London Society\r\nfor the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, to take charge of\r\nan Episcopal church that had been planted some years before in Rhode\r\nIsland. He arrived in 1721, and lived till 1759. He was an Irishman, and\r\nappears to have been somewhat haughty and irascible in his temperament\r\nand was disposed to find fault with the climate, the currency, the\r\npeople, and pretty much everything he came in contact with. He was\r\na man of observation, and during the thirty-eight years he spent in\r\nministering to the spiritual wants of his flock, he was not unmindful\r\nof what was passing around him, and made many notes and reflections on\r\nthe various phases of life as they presented themselves to his mind, and\r\nespecially on the products and industries of the colony. These notes and\r\nobservations he wrote out, and they were published in Dublin in 1753,\r\nunder the title of “America Dissected.”\r\n\r\nHis writings do not discover that he was a man of very ardent piety,\r\nbut he was honored as a good man while he lived, and was buried under\r\nthe altar he had served so long. His duties sometimes called him away\r\ninto Virginia, and, in speaking of the great distance of one parish from\r\nanother, he uses the following language:\r\n\r\n    “To remedy this (the distance), as the whole province, between\r\n    the mountains, two hundred miles up, and the sea, is all a\r\n    champaign, and without stones, they have plenty of a small\r\n    sort of horses, the best in the world, like the little Scotch\r\n    Galloways; and ’tis no extraordinary journey to ride from\r\n    sixty to seventy miles or more in a day. I have often, but\r\n    upon larger pacing horses, rode fifty, nay, sixty miles a day,\r\n    even here in New England, where the roads are rough, stony and\r\n    uneven.”\r\n\r\nThe reverend gentleman seems to assume that his readers knew the Scotch\r\nGalloways were pacers, and with this explanation his observations are\r\nvery plain. He makes no distinction between the Virginia horse and his\r\ncongener of Rhode Island except that of size, in which the latter had the\r\nadvantage. In speaking of the products of Rhode Island he says:\r\n\r\n    “The produce of this colony is principally butter and cheese,\r\n    fat cattle, wool, and fine horses, which are exported to all\r\n    parts of English America. They are remarkable for fleetness and\r\n    swift pacing; _and I have seen some of them pace a mile in a\r\n    little more than two minutes, and a good deal less than three_.”\r\n\r\nWhen I first read this sentence in the reverend doctor’s book I confess\r\nI was not prepared to accept it in any other light than that of a wild\r\nenthusiast, who knew but little of the force of the language he used. To\r\ntalk about horses pacing, a hundred and fifty years ago, in a little more\r\nthan two minutes and a good deal less than three, appeared to be simply\r\nmonstrous. The language evidently means, according to all fair rules of\r\nconstruction, that the mile was performed nearer two minutes than three,\r\nor in other words, considerably below two minutes and thirty seconds. I\r\ndoubt not my readers will hesitate, and perhaps refuse, to accept such a\r\nperformance, just as I did myself till I had carefully weighed not only\r\nthe character of the author of the statement, but the circumstances that\r\nseemed to support it. If the learned divine had known no more of the\r\nworld and its ways than many of his profession, I would have concluded he\r\nwas not a competent judge of speed; but he was a man of affairs, and knew\r\nperfectly well just what he was saying. The question naturally arises\r\nhere as to what opportunities or facilities the doctor had for timing\r\nthose pacers of a hundred and fifty years ago. In a note appended to the\r\nabove extract by Mr. Updike, the editor of the work, I find the following:\r\n\r\n    “The breed of horses called Narragansett pacers, once so\r\n    celebrated for fleetness, endurance and speed, has become\r\n    extinct. These horses were highly valued for the saddle, and\r\n    transported the rider with great pleasantness and sureness of\r\n    foot. The pure bloods could not trot at all. Formerly they had\r\n    pace-races. Little Neck Beach, in South Kingston, of one mile\r\n    in length, was the race course. A silver tankard was the prize,\r\n    and high bets were otherwise made on speed. Some of these prize\r\n    tankards were remaining a few years ago. Traditions respecting\r\n    the swiftness of these horses are almost incredible.”\r\n\r\nThe facts stated by Mr. Updike in this note are corroborated from other\r\nsources, and may be accepted as true. These were the opportunities\r\nand facilities the doctor had for holding his watch, and nobody will\r\ndoubt they were sufficient to enable him to be a competent witness.\r\nIn connection with this subject, and as another footnote, Mr. Updike\r\nintroduces a letter from Mr. I. T. Hazard, which brings out another very\r\ncurious fact in the history of the pacer. The Hazard family was very\r\neminent in Rhode Island, and many of its members have occupied positions\r\nof high honor and responsibility for several generations. The date of\r\nthe letter is not given, and we may infer it may have been written fifty\r\nyears ago, or perhaps more. Mr. Hazard says:\r\n\r\n    “Within ten years one of my aged neighbors, Enoch Lewis, since\r\n    deceased, informed me he had been to Virginia as one of the\r\n    riding boys, to return a similar visit of the Virginians in\r\n    that section, in a contest on the turf; and that such visits\r\n    were common with the racing sportsmen of Narragansett and\r\n    Virginia, when he was a boy. Like the old English country\r\n    gentlemen, from whom they were descended, they were a\r\n    horse-racing, fox-hunting, feasting generation.”\r\n\r\nThis paragraph from Mr. Hazard’s pen has been the subject of very\r\ndeliberate consideration. The first promptings of my judgment were\r\nto doubt and reject it, especially on account of the absence of date\r\nto the letter, and of the remote period in which Mr. Enoch Lewis\r\nmust have visited Virginia. Another question, as to why we have not\r\nthis information from any other source except Mr. Hazard, presented\r\nitself with no inconsiderable force. After viewing the matter in all\r\nits bearings I am forced to concede that it is likely to be true.\r\nThese visits must have taken place before the Revolution, and from\r\nthe construction we are able to place upon the dates, this was not\r\nimpossible. It is a fact that I do not hesitate to announce that before\r\nthe Revolution racing in all its forms was more universally indulged in\r\nas an amusement than it ever has been since. This was before the days of\r\nnewspapers, and all we can possibly know of the sporting events of that\r\nperiod we must gather up from the detached fragments that have come down\r\nto us by tradition. There was a strong bond of sympathy and friendship\r\nbetween the followers of Dr. McSparran in Rhode Island, surrounded as\r\nthey were by Puritans, and their co-religionists in Virginia. They were\r\naccustomed to maritime life, and had abundance of vessels fitted up\r\nfor the shipment of horses and other live stock to foreign ports. To\r\ntake a number of their fastest pacers on board one of their sloops and\r\nsail for Virginia would not have been considered much of an adventure.\r\nThese visits were not only occasions of pleasure and festivity, with\r\nthe incidental profits of winning purses and bets, but they were a most\r\nsuccessful means of advertising the Narragansett pacer; and through these\r\nmeans alone the market was opened, as Dr. McSparran expresses it, in\r\nall parts of British America. When we consider the widespread fame of\r\nthese Rhode Island horses, and that there were no other means by which\r\nthey could have achieved it, except by their actual performances, we are\r\nforced to the conclusion that they were carried long distances, and in\r\nmany directions, for purely sporting purposes. That these visits would\r\nresult in the transfer of a good number of the best and fastest horses\r\nfrom Narragansett to Virginia would be a natural sequence, and thus, in\r\nafter years, we might look for a strong infusion of Narragansett blood in\r\nthe Virginian pacing-horse.\r\n\r\nIt appears to be a law of our civilization that each generation produces\r\nsomebody who, out of pure love for the curious and forgotten, devotes\r\nthe best years of his life to hunting up old things that have well-nigh\r\nslipped away from the memory of man. In this class Mr. John F. Watson\r\nstands conspicuous in what he has done for Philadelphia and New York.\r\nIn 1830 he published a work entitled “Annals of Philadelphia and\r\nPennsylvania,” in two volumes, and among all the antiquated manners and\r\nhabits that he again brings to our knowledge, he has something to say\r\nabout the horse of an early day:\r\n\r\n    “The late very aged T. Matlack, Esq., was passionately fond of\r\n    races in his youth. He told me of his remembrances about Race\r\n    Street. In his early days the woods were in commons, having\r\n    several straggling forest trees still remaining there, and\r\n    the circular course ranging through those trees. He said all\r\n    genteel horses were pacers. A trotting-horse was deemed a base\r\n    breed. These Race Street races were mostly pace-races. His\r\n    father and others kept pacing stallions for propagating the\r\n    breed.”\r\n\r\nMr. Watson further remarks, on the same subject: “Thomas Bradford, Esq.,\r\nin telling me of the recollections of the races, says he was told that\r\nthe earliest races were scrub and pace-races on the ground now used as\r\nRace Street.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Israel Acrelius, for many years pastor of the Swedish church of\r\nPhiladelphia, wrote a book early in the last century, under the title,\r\n“History of New Sweden,” which has been translated into English. In\r\ndescribing the country and people, in their habits and amusements, he\r\nthus speaks of the horse:\r\n\r\n    “The horses are real ponies, and are seldom found over thirteen\r\n    hands high. He who has a good riding horse never employs him\r\n    for draught, which is also the less necessary, as journeys, for\r\n    the most part, are made on horseback. It must be the result of\r\n    this, more than to any particular breed in the horses, that the\r\n    country excels in fast horses, so that horse races are often\r\n    made for very high stakes.”\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that Mr. Acrelius does not say that these races were\r\npacing-races; but when his remark is taken in connection with what\r\nMr. Matlack said about the pacers, and when it is considered that he\r\nis speaking of the speed of the saddle horses as such, we can easily\r\nunderstand his true meaning. In our turf history I supposed I was getting\r\nwell back when I reached the great race between Galloway’s Selim and Old\r\nEngland, in 1767, but here we find that race was comparatively modern,\r\nand that the pacers antedated the gallopers by many, many years.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 Mr. Watson did the same service for New York that he had done for\r\nPhiladelphia, and published his “Annals of New York,” in which we find\r\nthe piece of horse history embodied in the extract printed on pages 126\r\nand 127, to which the reader will please turn.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible to be mistaken in assuming that Rip Van Dam’s\r\nletter was written to some person in Philadelphia, and that Mr. Watson\r\nsaw it there. I would give a great deal for the sight of it; and if it\r\nhas been preserved in any of the public libraries of that city, either\r\nin type or in manuscript form, I have good hopes of yet inspecting it.\r\nIn one point of view, it is of exceeding value, and that is its date.\r\nIt is fully established by this letter that, as early as 1711, the\r\nNarragansetts were not only established as a breed or family, but that\r\ntheir fame was already widespread. This, of necessity, carries us back\r\ninto the latter part of the seventeenth century, when their exceptional\r\ncharacteristics were first developed, or began to manifest themselves. In\r\nreaching that period we are so near the first importations of horses to\r\nthe colonies that it is no violence to either history or good sense to\r\nconclude that the original Narragansett was one among the very earliest\r\nimportations. This plays havoc with some Rhode Island traditions, as will\r\nbe seen below; but with 1711 fixed as a point when the breed was famous,\r\ntraditions must stand aside.\r\n\r\nWhile on this matter of dates, it may not be unprofitable to compare the\r\nadvent of the Narragansett with the well-known epochs in horse history.\r\nEvery schoolboy knows that the Darley Arabian and the Godolphin Arabian,\r\nsay twenty years after, were the great founders of the English race\r\nhorse. The Narragansetts had reached the very highest pinnacle of fame\r\nbefore the Darley Arabian was foaled. Darley Arabian reached England\r\nabout the same year that Rip Van Dam’s Narragansett jumped over the side\r\nof the sloop and swam ashore, and this was eighty years before there was\r\nan attempt at publishing an English stud book. When Janus and Othello,\r\nand Traveller, and Fearnaught, the great founders of the American race\r\nhorse, first reached Virginia, they found the Narragansett pacer had\r\nbeen there more than a generation before. On the point of antiquity,\r\ntherefore, the Narragansett is older than what we designate as the\r\nthoroughbred race horse, and if he has a lineal descendant living to-day\r\nthe pacer has a longer line of speed inheritance, at his gait, than the\r\ngalloper.\r\n\r\nThe only attempt at a description of this breed that I have met with is\r\nthat given by Cooper, the novelist, in a footnote to “The Last of the\r\nMohicans.” This note may be accepted as history, so far as it goes, and\r\npretends to be history; but I am not prepared to admit that all the breed\r\nwere sorrels. This color, no doubt, prevailed in those specimens that\r\nMr. Cooper had seen or heard of, but I think all colors prevailed, as in\r\nother breeds. He says:\r\n\r\n    “In the State of Rhode Island there is a bay called\r\n    Narragansett, so named for a strong tribe of Indians that\r\n    formerly dwelt on its banks. Accident, or one of those\r\n    unaccountable freaks which nature sometimes plays in the\r\n    animal world, gave rise to a breed of horses which were once\r\n    well known in America by the name of Narragansetts. They were\r\n    small, commonly of the color called sorrel in America, and\r\n    distinguished by their habit of pacing. Horses of this race\r\n    were, and still are, in much request as saddle-horses, on\r\n    account of their hardiness, and the ease of their movements. As\r\n    they were also sure of foot, the Narragansetts were much sought\r\n    for by females who were obliged to travel over the roots and\r\n    holes in the new countries.”\r\n\r\nWithout having a minute description of so much as a single individual\r\nof the race, I can only infer, from general descriptions, as to what\r\ntheir family peculiarities of form and shape may have been. It is fully\r\nestablished that they were very compact and hardy horses, and that they\r\nwere not large; perhaps averaging about fourteen and a quarter hands in\r\nheight. I have met with no intimation that they were stylish or handsome,\r\nand we think it is safe to conclude that they were plain in their form,\r\nand low in their carriage. From my conceptions of the horse I think one\r\nof the better-shaped Canadian pacers, of fifteen hands or thereabouts,\r\nmight be accepted as a fair representative of the Narragansett of\r\na hundred and fifty years ago. He was fleet, hardy, docile, and\r\nsure-footed, but not beautiful, and it is reasonable to suppose that the\r\nlack of style and beauty was one of the leading causes of his becoming\r\nextinct in the land of his nativity.\r\n\r\nIn considering the causes which resulted in what we may call the\r\ndispersal of the Narragansett pacers, and their extinction in the seat\r\nof their early fame, we must be governed by what is reasonable and\r\nphilosophical in the industrial interests of the people, rather than look\r\nfor some great overwhelming disaster, like an earthquake, that ingulfed\r\nthem in a night. In speaking of this dispersal, and the causes which led\r\nto it, Mr. Hazard says:\r\n\r\n    “One of the causes of the loss of that famous breed here was\r\n    the great demand for them in Cuba, when that island began to\r\n    cultivate sugar extensively. The planters became suddenly rich,\r\n    and wanted the pacing-horse for themselves and their wives and\r\n    daughters to ride, faster than we could supply them, and sent\r\n    an agent to this country to purchase them on such terms as he\r\n    could, but to purchase them at all events. I have heard my\r\n    father say he knew the agent very well, and he made his home\r\n    at the Rowland Brown House, at Tower Hill, where he commenced\r\n    purchasing and shipping until all the good ones were sent off.\r\n    He never let a good one escape him. This, and the fact that\r\n    they were not so well adapted to draught as other horses, was\r\n    the cause of their being neglected, and I believe the breed is\r\n    now extinct in this section. My father described the motion\r\n    of this horse as differing from others in that his backbone\r\n    moved through the air in a straight line, without inclining the\r\n    rider from side to side, as the common racker or pacer of the\r\n    present day. Hence it was very easy; and being of great power\r\n    of endurance, they would perform a journey of a hundred miles\r\n    in a day, without injury to themselves or rider.”\r\n\r\nWe can understand very well how an enormous and unexpected demand from\r\nCuba without restriction as to price, should reduce the numbers of the\r\nbreed very materially. But it is a poor compliment to the intelligence\r\nand thrift of the good people of Narragansett to say that, because there\r\nwas a lively demand, they killed the goose that laid the golden egg every\r\nday. It is a slander upon that Yankee smartness which is proverbial to\r\nconclude that they deprived themselves of the means of supplying a market\r\nthat was making them all rich. We must, therefore, look for other causes\r\nthat were more potent in producing, so marked a result.\r\n\r\nAfter more than a hundred years of faithful service, of great popularity,\r\nand of profitable returns to their breeders, the little Narragansetts\r\nbegan to disappear, just as their ancestors had disappeared a century\r\nearlier. Rhode Island was no longer a frontier settlement, but had grown\r\ninto a rich and prosperous State. Mere bridle paths through the woods had\r\ndeveloped into broad, smooth highways, and wheeled vehicles had taken\r\nthe place of the saddle. Under these changed conditions, the little\r\npacer was no longer desirable or even tolerable as a harness horse, and\r\nhe was supplanted by a larger and more stylish type of horse, better\r\nsuited to the particular kind of work required of him. This was simply\r\nthe “survival of the fittest,” considering the nature of the services\r\nrequired of the animal. The average height of the Narragansett was not\r\nover fourteen hands and one inch. His neck was not long, even for his\r\nsize; he dropped rapidly on the croup, and his carriage was low, with\r\nnothing of elegance or style in his appearance. His mane and tail were\r\nheavy, his hind legs were crooked, his limbs and feet were of the very\r\nbest, but aside from his great speed and the smoothness of his movements\r\nunder the saddle, there was nothing very desirable or attractive about\r\nhim. In a contest with a type of the harness horse, at least one hand\r\nhigher, of high carriage and elegant appearance, there could only be one\r\nresult, and that soon decided.\r\n\r\nAs in England, so in this country, the blood of the running horse soon\r\nworked the extermination of the pacer; not because it was stronger in\r\nreproducing itself, perhaps, but because it had the skill and fancy of\r\nthe breeder enlisted in selecting and mating so as to make the expunging\r\nprocess complete. Only a few years ago a pacing horse could hardly be\r\nfound in any of the older settled portions of the country, especially\r\nwhere running blood had become fashionable. He was literally banished to\r\nthe frontiers of Canada, Indiana, Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee, and\r\nespecially in the latter two States, where his blood is still appreciated\r\nand preserved for the luxurious saddle gaits which it alone transmits.\r\nIn many individual cases he has shown wonderful power in meeting and\r\novercoming antagonistic elements, but with the tide of running blood all\r\nagainst him, it was only a question of time as to how soon he would be\r\ntotally submerged.\r\n\r\nIt is only a quarter of a century ago that the first volume of “Wallace’s\r\nAmerican Trotting Register” was published, and then began the great task\r\nof bringing order out of chaos. In a historical introduction to that\r\nwork, I inserted the following:\r\n\r\n    “So many pacing horses have got fast trotters, so many pacing\r\n    mares have produced fast trotters, and so many pacers have\r\n    themselves become fast trotters, and little or nothing known of\r\n    their breeding, that I confess to a degree of embarrassment,\r\n    from which no philosophy relieves me. If the facts were limited\r\n    to a few individual cases we could ignore the phenomena\r\n    altogether, but, while they are by no means universal, they\r\n    are too common and apparent to be thus easily disposed of. I\r\n    am not aware that any writer has ever brought this question\r\n    to the attention of the public; much less, attempted its\r\n    discussion and explanation. Indeed, it is possible that the\r\n    observations of others may not sustain me in the prominence\r\n    given these phenomena, but all will concede there are some\r\n    cases coming under this head that are unexplained, and perhaps\r\n    unexplainable. It is probable trotters from this pacing origin,\r\n    and that appear to trot, only because their progenitors paced,\r\n    will not prove reliable producers of trotters. Such an animal\r\n    being in a great degree phenomenal, should not be too highly\r\n    prized in the stud, till he has proved himself a trotting sire\r\n    as well as a trotter.”\r\n\r\nThis very comprehensive little paragraph, put modestly and tentatively\r\nrather than positively, contained a germ of thought that is to-day\r\nexerting a very wide influence. So far as my knowledge goes, this was\r\nthe first time in which the public attention had ever been called to the\r\nintimate relations between speed at the pace and speed at the trot. Some\r\nlaughed at it as not practical, others sneered at it as a theoretical\r\nabstraction, a few gave it some thought, while the writers who never\r\nthink left it severely alone. It required the cumulative experiences\r\nof nearly ten years before horsemen generally began to think about it,\r\nand then ten more before the germ had matured itself in the minds of\r\nall intelligent men who were able to divest themselves of their earlier\r\nprejudices. The great primary truth now stands out in high relief that\r\nthe pace and the trot are simply two forms of one and the same gait,\r\nthat lies midway between the walk and the gallop. At last the truth,\r\ndimly foreshadowed in the paragraph above, is received and accepted, in\r\nsome form or other, almost if not quite universally. This fact and its\r\nacceptance are now shown in all the recorded experiences of racing, and\r\nespecially in the origin and habits of action of many of the heads of\r\ntrotting and pacing families, to which the reader is referred.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of Chapter XIII. I have labored to make plain the\r\nproposition that the pace and the trot are simply two forms of one and\r\nthe same gait. This is evident from the fact that this gait, in one form\r\nor the other, is the intermediate link between the walk and the gallop,\r\nand this is true among nearly all quadrupeds. I have also there shown,\r\nand I think beyond cavil, that the mechanism of the pace and the trot is\r\nthe same, and especially in the fact that in both forms two legs are used\r\nas one leg. That is, if the two legs on the same side move together, we\r\ncall it the pace, and if the diagonal legs move together we call it the\r\ntrot. The rhythm is the same and the sound is the same, and by the ear no\r\nman can tell whether the movement is at the lateral or diagonal motion.\r\nIn all the varieties of steps that a horse may be taught, and in all the\r\nmethods of progression that he may naturally adopt, there is no step\r\nor movement in which he uses two legs as one except in the pace or the\r\ntrot. From the place, therefore, which these two forms of the gait hold,\r\nindifferently, in animal movement, between the walk and the gallop; from\r\nthe unity of action and result in the use of the same mechanism, and from\r\nthe wide disparity between the mechanism of this gait and that of all\r\nother gaits in the action of the horse, we must conclude that the pace\r\nand the trot are one and the same gait.\r\n\r\nAnother evidence of the unity of the two forms of the trot is to be found\r\nin the great numbers of pacers that have been changed over to trotters\r\nand the astonishing readiness with which they took to the new form of\r\naction. To go back no further than the records sustain us, we find that\r\nthe converted pacer Pelham was the first horse that ever trotted in 2:28.\r\nThis was in 1849, and four years later the converted pacer Highland Maid\r\ntrotted in 2:27. Twenty years later, Occident, another, trotted in 2:16¾.\r\nThese were champions of their day, and when we come a little nearer we\r\nfind that Maud S. was a pacer and Sunol was a pacer, although neither\r\nof them ever paced in public, and the fact that they ever paced at all\r\nwas held as a kind of “home secret.” Since the days of Pelham, literally\r\nthousands of horses have been changed from pacers to trotters, and some\r\nhundreds have been changed from trotters to pacers successfully. Then\r\nthere are quite a number, like Jay-Eye-See, 2:10 trotting and 2:06¼\r\npacing, that have made fast records at both gaits.\r\n\r\nAt one time the pacing horse Blue Bull stood at the head of all sires\r\nof trotters in this country, and it is not known or believed that he\r\npossessed a single drop of trotting blood. He was a very fast pacer and\r\ncould do nothing else, and a large percentage of the mares bred to him\r\nwere pacers, and practically all the others had more or less pacing\r\nblood, but his great roll of trotters in the 2:30 list was the wonder of\r\nall horsemen of that period. Certainly the average of the elements in\r\nhis inheritance would place him very low in theory, but in practice he\r\nstruck back to some ancestor that was strongly prepotent. The trouble in\r\nhis case is practically the same as in all other pacing stallions—the\r\ninheritance traces back to a period more remote than any of the fast\r\ntrotting stallions, but at intervals it has been neglected and not\r\ndeveloped until it has become weak and uncertain from lack of use. The\r\nsame may be said of the Copperbottoms, Corbeaus, Flaxtails, Hiatogas,\r\nDavy Crockets, Pilots, Rainbows, Redbucks, St. Clairs, Tippoos, and Tom\r\nHals, as well as other heads of minor families that will be considered in\r\ntheir proper places.\r\n\r\nThe changes that have been wrought in the status of the pacer have\r\nbeen truly wonderful. Instead of being hidden away as an outcast\r\nand a disgrace to the family, condemned to a life of inferiority and\r\ndrudgery, he has been brought out and exhibited to the public as a son\r\nand heir and the equal of the best. In looking back over the trotting\r\nrecords of twenty years ago, any one will be surprised to observe that\r\nat all the leading meetings of the whole country there were no pacing\r\ncontests. Occasionally at the minor and local meetings of the middle\r\nWestern States, a pacing contest would be given for a small purse, in\r\nwhich local and obscure horses only would be engaged. Very naturally\r\nthe owners of pacing horses protested against this practical exclusion\r\nof their favorites from the trotting meetings, and employed all their\r\nenergies in begging for admission. When they began to be really clamorous\r\nthe managers of trotting tracks argued that there could be no profit to\r\nthem in opening pacing contests, for nobody cared about seeing a pacing\r\nmatch, that the entries would not fill, and especially that there would\r\nbe no betting, that, consequently, the pool-sellers would have nothing\r\nto divide with the management. As the receipts for pool-selling and all\r\nother gambling privileges were making the track managers rich, they were\r\nvery slow about admitting an untried element that might diminish their\r\nprofits. But gradually and patiently the pacers worked their way into the\r\nexclusive circle, and when they appeared everybody, especially in the\r\nEastern States, was surprised to see what excellent horses they were and\r\nthe terrific speed they showed. Instead of the typical pacer, as formed\r\nin the popular mind, with the low head, bull neck, low croup, hairy legs,\r\nexuberant mane and tail, and generally “Canuck” all over, that would stop\r\nat the end of the first half-mile, here was an array of horses that in\r\nmake-up and gameness would average just as well as the same number of\r\ntrotters. This was a revelation to great multitudes of people, and from\r\nthat time forward the pacer had a fair show, on his merits. For hundreds\r\nof years the pacer, with very few exceptions, has been able to show a\r\nlittle higher rate of speed than the trotter. When Flora Temple smashed\r\nall records in 1859 by trotting in 2:19¾, Pocahontas had drawn a wagon,\r\nfive years earlier, in 2:17½; and when Maud S. trotted in 1885 in 2:08¾,\r\nthis beat all laterals as well as diagonals, except Johnson, who the year\r\nbefore had paced in 2:06¼. In 1894 Alix trotted a mile in 2:03¾, which\r\nstands the best at this writing, but the same year Robert J. paced in\r\n2:01½, and John R. Gentry in 2:00½ in 1896.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose here to undertake to discuss the reasons for the\r\nalmost continuous supremacy of the pacer over the trotter, for there is\r\nno data from which I might frame a conclusion that would really “hold\r\nwater.” At best, therefore, I can only suggest two or three thoughts.\r\nSpeed at the pace is older, and has been longer in the process of\r\ndevelopment, than speed at the trot. In 1747 pacing races had then been\r\nfashionable in Maryland, and had been carried on in that colony time\r\nout of mind, but we have no trace of trotting races. One year later\r\n(1748) “running, pacing and trotting” races had become so numerous and\r\nso common in the colony of New Jersey that they were declared a nuisance\r\nand suppressed by the legislative authority. My impression from the\r\nlanguage of the act is that it was aimed chiefly at the running and the\r\npacing races, and that the trotters were not very numerous. It seems to\r\nbe a reasonable conclusion that this racing mania in New Jersey took its\r\nrise about 1665, when Governor Nicolls established the Newmarket race\r\ncourse on Long Island, and if so, it had been growing in strength for\r\nover eighty years, and if we add the time from then till now we find that\r\nthe speed of the pacer has been going on almost continuously for over two\r\nhundred years in our own country. There is another fact entering into the\r\nrural life of colonial times that must not be left out of consideration.\r\nThe pacer was the universal saddle horse, and the trotter never was\r\ntolerated for that service. Every farmer’s son had his saddle horse, and\r\nwhen two of them met what so natural and common as to determine then\r\nand there which was the faster, if a little stretch of road offered?\r\nIn these neighborhood rivalries, if not in actual racing, the instinct\r\nof speed at the pace was kept alive and developed, from generation to\r\ngeneration. If I am right in this little study of colonial life, we can\r\nunderstand that the inheritance of speed at the pace has come down to our\r\nown time through a great many generations of pacers, and hence the pace\r\nis the faster gait. There is one fact in our own experience that seems to\r\nsustain this with great force, and that is the small amount of “pounding”\r\nthat the pacer requires in order to reach the full development of his\r\npowers. There is no need of driving a pacer to death in order to teach\r\nhim how to pace, for he already knows how to pace, and all that is needed\r\nin the way of training is to get him into high condition. It may be\r\npossible that the lateral action is faster than the diagonal because it\r\nis less complicated, but I can see no anatomical reason for this, as the\r\ntwo legs in both gaits act as one leg. The only difference I can see in\r\npractice is that the trotter has more up-and-down motion than the pacer;\r\nthat is, he bounds in every revolution, describing a series of depressed\r\ncurves with his back as he moves, while the pacer rises less from the\r\nground with his hind feet and seems to glide instead of bound; in other\r\nwords, there is less action thrown away by the pacer than the trotter,\r\nand this may arise from the more complex action in the diagonal than in\r\nthe lateral motion.\r\n\r\nThe pacer has reached a higher acclivity than the trotter, but he is not\r\nso well assured in his footing. His present popularity and his upward\r\nflight are phenomenal, but the causes that have sent him there are\r\nabnormal and not lasting. In his best individualities he is simply a\r\ngambling machine when in the hands of unscrupulous men, to be manipulated\r\nin whatever direction he will make the most money. Racing, at whatever\r\ngait, is not necessarily demoralizing nor disreputable, but when it\r\nfalls into the control of the “professionals” it becomes both. So long\r\nas it remains under the control of the breeders it is not only honorable\r\nand legitimate for them to develop and race their stock, but it is a\r\nnecessary adjunct to their business, for they must thus bring their\r\nproducts before the public, if they expect to make their business pay.\r\nBreeders should not own race tracks, or if they do, they should have no\r\npart nor lot in the percentage uniformly paid for the gambling privilege.\r\n\r\nThe history of racing in this country teaches over and over again that\r\nwhenever the breeding and racing interest falls into the control of\r\ngamblers, down goes the whole interest and honest men suffer with the\r\nrogues. The grasping track managers are to-day complaining loudly that\r\nthey cannot afford to give trotting meetings unless they are allowed to\r\nbring in the pool-sellers and make them divide the “swag” with the track.\r\nEvery attempt by legislatures to make gambling on races a felony outside\r\nthe race track and a virtue inside is a most arrant humbug and most\r\ndestructive in its results. It makes the race track a cesspool of every\r\nvice, and a stench in the nostrils of every honest man and decent woman.\r\nThe moral sense of the people all over this country is being aroused, and\r\nif public gambling cannot be suppressed on horse races, then history will\r\nrepeat itself and horse racing will be wiped out. The gamblers and their\r\nfriends will sneer at this as “puritanism,” but no difference about the\r\nname—it will come.\r\n\r\nBut, destructive and ruinous as gambling on races may be to the life\r\nand moral character of young men, as well as to the material interests\r\nof honest and reputable breeders, it hardly comes within my province to\r\ndiscuss it further in this place, and therefore I will return to the\r\nconsideration of the pacer. As the historical periodicity is now looming\r\nin sight when the moral sense of the people will command the suppression\r\nof racing of every kind, the question becomes exceedingly pertinent as\r\nto what is to become of the pacer? He will no longer be of any value as\r\na gambling machine, the days of the saddle horse are past as a means\r\nof travel, except by a few about the parks of the cities, and however\r\nuppish and handsome he may be, he is not and never will be a desirable\r\ndriving horse in harness. We have already used sufficient of his blood to\r\ncreate the American Saddle Horse, and if the saddle horse shall produce\r\n“after his kind” we need no more infusions from the pure pacer. In the\r\ntrotter his blood has leavened everything, and in some lines more than we\r\ndesire or need. He has been a great source of trotting speed, and if, as\r\nI am inclined to believe, Messenger’s power to transmit trotting speed\r\ncame from the old English pacer, then the pacer is the only source of\r\nthat speed. Under the condition of things as here foreshadowed he will\r\nprobably sink back into the obscurity from which he emerged twenty years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN SADDLE HORSE.\r\n\r\n    The saddle gaits come only from the pacer—Saddle gaits\r\n    cultivated three hundred years ago—Markham on the saddle\r\n    gaits—The military seat the best—The unity of the pace and\r\n    trot—Gaits analyzed—Saddle Horse Register—Saddle horse\r\n    progenitors—Denmark not a thoroughbred horse.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters the pacer has been considered from the\r\nstandpoint of his antiquity, history, speed at the pace, and his\r\ncontributions to speed at the trot. We now come to consider him as the\r\nfounder of the best and most delightful type of saddle horses in the\r\nworld. This estimate of his quality and value had a solid foundation\r\nin the judgment and habits of our ancestors at an early period in our\r\nhistory. When our patriotic forbears entered upon the struggle for\r\nindependence, they were fully alive to the necessity of foreign sympathy\r\nand aid. For this purpose agents were sent abroad to enlist the good\r\nfeelings and, if possible, secure co-operation of foreign governments,\r\nespecially that of France. Mr. Silas Dean was sent to Paris, and in a\r\ncommunication to the secret committee of Congress, under date of November\r\n28, 1776, he writes: “I wish I had here one of your best saddle horses,\r\nof the American or Rhode Island breed—a present of that kind would be\r\nmoney well laid out with a certain personage.” This was probably intended\r\nas a present to Marie Antoinette, or some other person having great\r\ninfluence at court. It further indicates that “the American or Rhode\r\nIsland Saddle Horse” was at that period, in Mr. Dean’s opinion at least,\r\nthe best in the world. (See Dean Papers, New York Historical Society,\r\nVol. I., p. 377.)\r\n\r\nTo the man of average intelligence and candor on horse subjects it\r\ncertainly is not necessary to enter upon an elaborate discussion to\r\nshow that the saddle gaits come from the pacer, but a certain class\r\nof writers, who neither declare nor attempt to prove their position,\r\nconstantly imply that the saddle gaits came from the “thoroughbred.” As\r\nit is better, therefore, to make everything plain as we go along, I will\r\nvery briefly consider this point. Twelve years ago, through _Wallace’s\r\nMonthly_, I presented the following questions to all gentlemen interested\r\nin saddle-horse affairs and acquainted with saddle-horse history: “Are\r\nall the tribes and families noted for their saddle qualities descended\r\nin whole or in part from pacing ancestry?” In order to cover the whole\r\nquestion, no difference from what standpoint it might be considered, I\r\nadded the following: “Has any family or subfamily of saddle horses come\r\nfrom pure running ancestry and without any admixture of pacing blood?” To\r\nthese questions Major Hord, then editor of the _Spirit of the Farm_, at\r\nNashville, Tennessee, a gentleman of very wide and accurate knowledge on\r\nthis subject, but strongly in favor of running blood, made the following\r\nresponse through his paper:\r\n\r\n    “We can only draw conclusions from established facts in\r\n    reference to these questions, for we do not think they can\r\n    be answered otherwise, as the original ancestry of our best\r\n    saddle families is more or less clouded in obscurity. It is an\r\n    established fact, demonstrated by experience, that in order to\r\n    get a saddle horse, the quickest and most successful way is to\r\n    get in the pacing blood; it matters not how good or bad the\r\n    other blood may be, a strong dash of pacing blood will almost\r\n    invariably improve the animal for saddle purposes, and never,\r\n    under any circumstances, does a pacing cross detract from an\r\n    animal’s qualities for the saddle. Judging from these facts, we\r\n    conclude that all our saddle families are descended, at least\r\n    in part, from pacing ancestry. On the other hand, all our best\r\n    saddle families have a strong infusion of thoroughbred running\r\n    blood. This blood, however, is valuable only for the courage,\r\n    bone, and finish it gives the animal, for it imparts none of\r\n    the saddle gaits; and while we have secured the best results\r\n    in breeding the saddle horse by mixing the running and pacing\r\n    blood, we have observed that too much running blood in the\r\n    stallion detracts from his success as a sire of saddle stock.\r\n    As a rule, no trainer’s skill can make a good saddle horse out\r\n    of a thoroughbred runner, whereas if you mix two or more strong\r\n    pacing crosses on top of the running blood, a child can gait\r\n    the produce to the saddle. We have sometimes seen good saddle\r\n    horses that were thoroughbreds, but have never seen a perfect\r\n    one. Our observation and experience lead us to the conclusion\r\n    that the natural saddle gaits come from the pacers, but to the\r\n    runner we are indebted for the size, style, bone and finish of\r\n    our saddle stock.”\r\n\r\nIn this reply, when the author says “all of our saddle families are\r\ndescended, at least in part, from pacing ancestry,” and when he adds\r\nto this that “running blood imparts none of the saddle gaits,” he has\r\nanswered both questions very fully and very satisfactorily. The argument\r\nthat running blood gives bone and finish, and all that, is very well\r\nas a theory of breeding, but it has nothing to do with the questions\r\npropounded. As all families of saddle horses have pacing blood, and as\r\nthere is no family without it, it may be taken as settled that the saddle\r\ngaits come from the pacer.\r\n\r\nI notice that at least one of the present saddle gaits was cultivated\r\nmore than three hundred years ago. Mr. Gervaise Markham, a writer of the\r\nsixteenth century, and probably the second English author on the horse,\r\nsays: “If you buy a horse for pleasure the amble is the best, in which\r\nyou observe that he moves both his legs on one side together, neat with\r\ncomplete deliberation, for if he treads too short he is apt to stumble,\r\nif too large to cut and if shuffling or rowling he does it slovenly and\r\nbesides rids no ground. If your horse be designed for hunting, a racking\r\npace is most expedient, which little differs from the amble, only is\r\nmore active and nimble, whereby the horse observes due motion, but you\r\nmust not force him too eagerly, lest being in confusion he lose all\r\nknowledge of what you design him to, and so handle his legs carelessly.”\r\nThe orthography of the work “rack” as used by Markham is “wrack,” and\r\nthis is the only place I have met with it in any of the old authors.\r\nWebster defines the word “rack” as “a fast amble,” but Markham uses it\r\nin contradistinction from the amble. It is worthy of note here that the\r\nword “rack” is older than the word “pace,” in its use as designating\r\nthe particular gait of the horse, and through all the centuries it has\r\nbeen retained. Of all the gaits that are subsidiary to the pace and\r\nderived from that gait, the rack is probably the most common, and in\r\nmany sections of the country the pacer is called a racker. Racking is\r\noften designated as “single-footing,” and in this gait as well as in\r\nthe running walk and fox trot, there are four distinct impacts in the\r\nrevolution. It follows, then, that they are not susceptible of a very\r\nhigh rate of speed.\r\n\r\nIn all the services which the horse renders and in all the relations\r\nwhich he bears to his master, there is no relation in which they can be\r\nmade to appear to such great mutual advantage as when the one animal is\r\ncarrying the other on his back. There is no occasion on which a beautiful\r\nhorse looks so well as when gracefully mounted and skillfully handled by\r\na lady or gentleman. And, I will add, there is no occasion when a lady or\r\ngentleman, who is at home in the saddle, looks so well as when mounted\r\non a beautiful and well-trained American horse. England has no saddle\r\nhorses, and never can have any till she secures American blood and adopts\r\nAmerican methods. The shortening of the stirrups and the swinging up\r\nand down like a tilt-hammer is not, with our English friends, a matter\r\nof choice, but a necessity to avoid being jolted to death. Their very\r\nsilly imitators, on this side, think they can’t afford to be out of the\r\nfashion, because “it’s English, you know.” For safety, true gentility,\r\nand comfort the military seat is the only seat, and if you have a horse\r\nupon which you can’t keep that seat without punishment, he is no saddle\r\nhorse. If your doctor tells you that your liver needs shaking up, mount\r\nan English trotting horse, but if you ride for pleasure and fresh air,\r\nget a horse that is bred and trained to the saddle gaits. There is just\r\nas much difference between the two horses as the difference between a\r\nspringless wagon on a cobble-stone pavement and a richly upholstered\r\ncoach on the asphalt.\r\n\r\nThe American Saddle Horse has an origin as well as a history. His origin\r\ndates back thousands of years, and his history has been preserved in art\r\nand in letters since the beginning of the Christian era. For centuries\r\nhe was the fashionable horse in England, and the only horse ridden by\r\nthe nobility and gentry. Away back in the reign of Elizabeth it was not\r\nan uncommon thing to use hopples to teach and compel trotters to pace,\r\njust as in our day hopples are often used to teach and compel pacers to\r\ntrot. In the early settlement of the American colonies pacers were far\r\nmore numerous than trotters, and this continued to be the case till after\r\nthe War of the Revolution. The great influx of running blood after that\r\nperiod practically banished the pacer to the western frontiers, where a\r\nremnant has been preserved for the uses of the saddle; and on account of\r\nhis great speed and gameness he has again returned to popular favor in\r\nour own day.\r\n\r\nThe walk and the canter, or short gallop, are gaits that are common to\r\nall breeds and varieties of horses, but what are known as “the saddle\r\ngaits” are derived wholly from the pace and are therefore considered\r\nmodifications or variations of the pace. In regions of country where\r\nthe saddle horse is bred and developed these gaits are well known among\r\nhorsemen and riders as the rack (single-footing), the running-walk, and\r\nthe fox-trot. These gaits are not easily described so as to be understood\r\nwithout an example before the eye. The rack is the most easily explained\r\nso as to be comprehended, and it is sometimes called the slow pace. In\r\nthis movement the hind foot strikes the ground an instant before the fore\r\nfoot on the same side, then the other two feet are moved and strike in\r\nthe same way; thus there are four strokes in the revolution, in pairs.\r\nAs each foot has its own stroke we see the appositeness of the phrase\r\n“single-footing.” The four strokes are in pairs, as one, two—three,\r\nfour, and in many cases as the speed of the horse increases the interval\r\nbetween the strokes is lost and the horse is at a clean rapid pace. As\r\na matter of course none of these gaits in which the horse makes four\r\nstrokes instead of two in the revolution can be speedy. They are not\r\ndeveloped nor cultivated for speed alone, but for the comfort and ease of\r\nthe rider and the change from one to another for the rest and ease of the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nThese “saddle gaits” are always derivatives from the pace, and I never\r\nhave seen one that did not possess more or less pacing blood. A careful\r\nexamination of the first and second volumes of “The National Saddle\r\nHorse Register” establishes this fact beyond all possible contradiction.\r\nThis work is a very valuable contribution to the horse history of the\r\ncountry, but it is a misfortune that more care has not been taken in the\r\nexclusion of fictitious crosses in a great multitude of pedigrees. This\r\ntrouble is specially apparent among the supposed breeding of many of\r\nthe old stallions that are inserted as “Foundation Stock.” The tendency\r\nthroughout seems to be to cover up and hide away the very blood to\r\nwhich we are indebted for the saddle horse, and to get in all the blood\r\npossible that is in direct antagonism to the foundation of the saddle\r\ngaits. It can be accepted as a fundamental truth in horse lore, that from\r\nthe day the first English race horse was imported into this country to\r\nthe present day, which covers a period of about one hundred and fifty\r\nyears, nobody has ever seen, either in England or in this country, a\r\nthoroughbred horse that was a pacer. When the old race horse Denmark\r\ncovered the pacing daughter of the pacer Cockspur, the pacing blood of\r\nthe dam controlled the action and instincts of the colt, and in that colt\r\nwe have the greatest of saddle-horse sires, known as Gaines’ Denmark.\r\n\r\nAs this horse Denmark was by far the greatest of all saddle-horse\r\nprogenitors, and as his superiority has been widely attributed to his\r\n“thoroughbred” sire Denmark, the son of imported Hedgford, I have taken\r\nsome pains to examine his pedigree. His sire was thoroughbred, his dam\r\nand grandam were mongrels, and the remoter crosses were impossible\r\nfictions. The fact that he ran four miles cuts no figure as evidence\r\nof purity of blood, for horses were running four miles in this country\r\nbefore the first “thoroughbred” was born. Of the fourteen stallions that\r\nare inserted as “Foundation Stock,” it is unfortunate that the choice\r\nseems to be practically restricted to the State of Kentucky, while the\r\nStates of Ohio, Indiana, and Tennessee, to say nothing of Illinois,\r\nMissouri, etc., have produced numbers of families and tribes that are\r\nmuch more prominent and valuable from the true saddle-horse standpoint\r\nthan some that appear in the select list of fourteen. It is doubtless\r\ntrue, however, that more attention has been paid to symmetry and style,\r\nand to the correct development and culture of the true saddle gaits, in\r\nKentucky than in any of the other States. With such horses as Gaines’\r\nDenmark, John Dillard, Tom Hal, Brinker’s Drennon, Texas, Peters’\r\nHalcorn, and Copperbottom the list is all right, but the other half-dozen\r\nare mostly young and have hardly been heard of outside of their own\r\nimmediate neighborhoods. It is a notable fact that old Pacing Pilot does\r\nnot appear as the progenitor of a saddle family.\r\n\r\nIn considering the comparative merits of the leading foundation stallions\r\nwe find that Denmark was not a success in any direction except as the\r\nsire of handsome and stylish saddle horses. John Dillard may not have\r\nbeen the equal of Denmark, in the elegance of his progeny, but he far\r\nsurpassed him in his valuable relations to the trotter. His daughters\r\nbecame quite famous as the producers of trotters of a high order, and\r\nthey have over twenty in the 2:30 list. The Tom Hals have developed\r\nphenomenal speed at the pace, and a great deal of it, interspersed with\r\nbut few trotters.\r\n\r\nOf late years many owners of the very best material for saddle stock have\r\ngiven their whole attention to the development of speed, either at the\r\nlateral or diagonal motion, because it has been deemed more profitable.\r\nIn thus selecting, breeding and developing for extreme speed, the\r\nadaptation to saddle purposes has been lost or bred out. While it is true\r\nthat some colts come into the world endowed with all the saddle gaits, it\r\nis also true that skill and patience are requisite in teaching the saddle\r\nhorse good manners. There is no imaginable use to which the horse can be\r\nput where he will show his beautiful form and thorough education to so\r\ngreat advantage as under the saddle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE WILD HORSES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n    The romances of fifty years ago—Was the horse indigenous\r\n    to this country?—The theories of the paleontologists not\r\n    satisfactory—Pedigrees of over two millions of years too\r\n    long—Outlines of horses on prehistoric ruins evidently\r\n    modern—The linguistic test among the oldest tribes of Indians\r\n    fails to discover any word for “Horse”—The horses abandoned\r\n    west of the Mississippi by the followers of De Soto about 1541\r\n    were the progenitors of the wild horses of the plains.\r\n\r\n\r\nFifty years ago there was much that was romantic and mysterious in our\r\nconceptions of the real character and origin of the vast herds of wild\r\nhorses that abounded on our Western plains, and the same remark applies\r\nto their congeners on the pampas of South America. The wild horse and\r\nthe Indian opened up a most inviting field for the writers of romance,\r\nand current literature was flooded with “Wild Western” stories, with\r\nthe horse and the Indian as the leading characters. We are now one\r\ngeneration, at least, this side of the time when stories of this kind are\r\neither sought or read, but we are not past the period when the origin\r\nor introduction of the horse on this continent may be considered with\r\ninterest and profit. Before touching upon the wild horse, as known in our\r\nearly history, however, it may be well to consider, briefly, the question\r\nas to whether he may not have been indigenous to this continent.\r\n\r\nIn our generation the spade has become a wonderful developer of the\r\ntruths of ancient history. The buried and forgotten cities of the old\r\nworld are being unearthed in Europe, Asia and Africa, and thousands\r\nof works of art and learning that had vanished from the face of the\r\nearth are again restored to the knowledge of the human race. In a\r\nkindred branch of investigation the geologists and paleontologists have\r\nbeen delving into the bowels of the earth—not to find what previous\r\ngenerations of men had left behind them, but to find what life was\r\nmyriads of ages before man was placed on the earth. Out of the rocks\r\nthey have, literally, quarried many strange examples of animal life\r\nthat lave been buried millions of years, and hundreds of feet below the\r\npresent surface. Among these strange petrefactions that were thus buried\r\nwhen the earth was young, there is one that has been widely exploited as\r\nthe “Primal Horse,” that is, the animal from which our present horse was\r\nfinally evolved. There are three or four specimens of this petrefaction\r\nnow on exhibition in this country, the first having been discovered\r\nby Professor Marsh, of Yale College, and now in the museum of that\r\ninstitution. Nearly twenty years ago Professor Huxley, the great English\r\nnaturalist, delivered a lecture in this city on the Marsh petrefaction as\r\nhis text, in which he told us that the “Primal Horse” had, originally,\r\nfive toes on each foot, that after an indeterminate geological period he\r\nlost the two outside toes on the hind feet, and after another million\r\nyears, more or less, he lost the outside toes of the fore feet, thus\r\nleaving him ready to go on developing the middle toe into the foot and\r\nhoof of the horse while the outside toes disappeared. In proof of this\r\nhe offered the fact that horses of this day have splint bones on each\r\nside of the leg, under the knee, and these bones are the remnants of the\r\noutside toes. This was the explanation which the learned professor gave\r\nin disposing of the outside toes when there were but three toes on each\r\nfoot, but he failed to explain what had become of the outside toes when\r\nthere were five on each foot, and there his whole explanation toppled to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nIn the American Museum of Natural History, in this city, there is a very\r\nfine representative of this particular type of petrefactions. It is\r\nabout fifteen inches high, with a head that is disproportionately large,\r\nand a tail that is long and slender, suggesting that of a leopard. On\r\neach fore foot this animal has four toes, or claws, as we might call\r\nthem, and on each hind foot three claws. With these claws this little\r\nanimal might dig in the ground, or he might climb a tree when necessary\r\nfor either safety or food. Each one of these toes has its own distinct\r\ncolumn of joints and bone extending to the knee, and there is no material\r\ndifference in the size and strength of these different columns. Now,\r\nwith three toes and three columns only, we can accept or reject, as we\r\nplease, Professor Huxley’s method of getting the two superfluous ones\r\nout of sight by pointing to the splint bones on the leg of a modern\r\nhorse and saying these are the remnants of the outside toes. But, in the\r\nmeantime, neither Mr. Huxley nor anybody else has told us what became\r\nof the outside toes and their columns in cases where there were five\r\ntoes. It will not do to chuck these out of sight and say nothing about\r\nthem; they must be accounted for or the theory fails. In the specimen now\r\nunder examination the fore feet are each supplied with four toes, and\r\neach toe is supported by its own distinct column of bone. Here we meet\r\nwith the same difficulty as in the case of five toes, for we have more\r\nmaterial than the Huxley theory is able to provide for. This theory has\r\nbeen generally accepted among specialists, in this line of investigation,\r\nand they all point to the splint bones, as already stated, as the\r\nremnants of the two toes, adhering to the main column. This leaves the\r\none superfluous toe wholly unprovided for, and thus the theory discredits\r\nitself and leaves the question in a shape that is entirely unsatisfactory\r\nand unacceptable to the understanding.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of this specimen, in their shape and arrangement, very strongly\r\nresemble the teeth of the horse. Upon this one fact is placed the chief\r\nreliance to sustain the claim that this was the “Primal Horse,” but\r\nthis fact, when taken without the support of other facts, simply proves\r\nthat the animal was herbivorous, subsisting on the same kind of food as\r\nthe horse, but it does not prove that he was a horse. The teeth are an\r\nexcellent starting point, and we admit their arrangement and resemblance\r\nto the teeth of the horse, but the rules of comparative anatomy, as well\r\nas common sense, require that at some other point or points there should\r\nbe at least a suggestion of resemblance. In this case there is absolutely\r\nno resemblance, but a very marked and unmistakable divergence. The foot\r\nof this little animal, fifteen inches high, bears no more resemblance\r\nto the foot of the horse than the foot of the dog bears to the foot of\r\nthe horse. Indeed, the foot of the specimen before us, whether provided\r\nwith three, four or five claws, very strikingly resembles the foot\r\nof the dog. The arrangement of the different specimens of the feet,\r\ncommencing with the smallest with four toes and ending with the perfect\r\nand full-grown foot of the horse as we know him, intended to illustrate\r\nthe process of evolution, is a very interesting study, but when you have\r\ndone with the last foot with claws and reach forward for the first foot\r\nwith a hoof, you find there is an impassable gulf between them, over\r\nwhich the theory of Evolution has not been able to construct a bridge.\r\nBut there is another consideration that is final and that cannot be\r\novercome by any theory whatever. According to the chronology widely\r\naccepted among geologists, this little animal was buried in the sand\r\nmore than two millions of years ago, and in a grave more than a hundred\r\nfeet below the general surface of the country in which he was found. In\r\nsome great upheaval or cataclysm of the earth’s surface, this little\r\nanimal, with all his contemporaries, perished, and there perished with\r\nhim all possibility of propagating his race. It is only a waste of time,\r\ntherefore, to speculate upon what a certain race of animals might have\r\nproduced in our day, when they were all cut off two millions of years\r\nago. With this disposition of the little animal with the variety of toes,\r\nquarried from the rocks and by courtesy here called the “Primal Horse,”\r\nwe reach another prehistoric epoch in our inquiry, but much less remote\r\nthan the one just considered.\r\n\r\nFrom the incredible numbers of wild horses on our Western plains and on\r\nthe pampas of South America, at a very early period in history, it became\r\na question of some interest with many thinking men as to whether the\r\nhorse was not indigenous on this continent. It is within the knowledge\r\nof everybody that this continent was inhabited by a mysterious and\r\nunknown race of people long before it was visited by Europeans. These\r\nmysterious people seem to have been driven out by the fierce and warlike\r\nsavages who occupied the country at the time of its discovery, and even\r\nthey knew nothing about the people who had preceded them. In very many\r\nlocalities the vanished people left behind them marks, numerous and\r\nunmistakable, that they had made considerable progress in the arts of\r\ncivilized life. Writers have generally designated them as “the Mound\r\nBuilders,” because they heaped great _tumuli_ of earth over the graves of\r\ntheir distinguished dead, but the real “Mound Builders” did far more than\r\nthis, for with immense labor they built great, strong defenses for their\r\nprotection against their enemies. When we go further West and South, into\r\nthe fertile valleys among the mountains, we find still later traces of\r\nthese unknown people in the ruins of buildings and dwellings erected,\r\nwith infinite labor, traces of irrigating canals, etc., but we still fail\r\nto come up with them, or any trace of their history. In that region ruins\r\nof this type are designated as “Aztec Ruins,” but this title puts us no\r\nfurther on the way of who the builders were. In 1877 a correspondent of\r\na Colorado newspaper, who seemed to write intelligently and candidly,\r\ndescribed some of those ruins which he found in the valley of the Las\r\nAnimas, in Southwestern Colorado. He speaks of a valley fifteen miles\r\nlong and seven miles wide, on the Animas River, and says this valley was\r\ncovered with dwellings built of stone, but he gives particular attention\r\nto a row of buildings built of sandstone laid in adobe mud. These\r\nbuildings are about three hundred feet long and three hundred feet apart,\r\nas I understand the writer, and extend a distance of six thousand feet.\r\nThe outside walls are four feet thick and the inside ones from one and a\r\nhalf to three feet thick; there are rooms still left and walls remaining\r\nthat indicate a building four stories high. In some of the rooms there\r\nare writings that never have been deciphered, and in one of them there\r\nare drawings of tarantulas, centipedes, horses and men. The word “horses”\r\nriveted my attention, and connected with it there were several things\r\nto be considered. First, were the drawings really intended to represent\r\nhorses? Second, if so might they not have been placed there long after\r\nthe builders had disappeared and in recent years? Third, if placed there\r\nby the builders, what was their date, and were they before or after the\r\nintroduction of the horse into Mexico by the Spaniards? The possibility\r\nof ever obtaining any satisfactory information about these drawings and\r\ntheir date seemed very remote, but after watching and waiting for about\r\neighteen years, I have recently received two letters that settle the\r\nwhole matter so far as these particular ruins are concerned.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles McLoyd, a very intelligent gentleman of Durango, Colorado,\r\nwho has made a special study of the Cliff Dwellers and kindred subjects,\r\nin that part of the world, writing under date of January 10, 1895, says:\r\n\r\n    “I am unable to inform you in regard to the pictures on those\r\n    particular ruins, but can say that in no other locality have\r\n    I found pictures of horses or anything to indicate that these\r\n    prehistoric races had any knowledge of the animal. If such\r\n    pictures existed we would be unable to determine anything\r\n    definite from them; or in other words, it would not show that\r\n    the horse was on this continent before the Spaniards brought\r\n    him, but rather that the people who constructed the buildings\r\n    lived here after the Spaniards came. I have often seen pictures\r\n    of horses on the walls of cañons, but there is no question\r\n    but they were the work of the present Indians. We often find\r\n    associated with them pictures of railroad trains, etc., that\r\n    indicate that some of them are of very recent date. To sum the\r\n    matter up, would say that, so far, there is no evidence that\r\n    these races had any knowledge of the horse, or had ever seen\r\n    the Spaniards.”\r\n\r\nMr. John A. Koontz, of Aztec, New Mexico, writes under date of January\r\n24, 1895. He knows all about the ruins in question, for he owns the land\r\non which they are situated, and puts the whole matter very clearly, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “I know nothing of the drawings of horses and other animals on\r\n    the walls of the ‘Aztec Ruins’ here that Mr. Wallace speaks\r\n    of. I think the drawings were all in the imagination of the\r\n    correspondent to whom Mr. Wallace refers. I have been familiar\r\n    with the ruins for fourteen years and this is the first time I\r\n    have ever heard of any drawings of horses on any of the walls.\r\n    There are drawings on some rocks some miles from the ruins, but\r\n    from their nature I have considered them the work of the modern\r\n    Indians. These ruins were visited by a party of archeologists\r\n    two years ago, who spent several weeks here, and made a survey,\r\n    with maps and general drawings of the same. They decided that\r\n    the main building had, originally, over seven hundred rooms.”\r\n\r\nThese letters are conclusive, so far as the region of the Las Animas is\r\nconcerned, and with that region knocked out there is not enough left\r\nto justify further search for evidence that the prehistoric races had\r\nany knowledge of the horse. Nothing remained then but the linguistic\r\ntest, and in 1885 I had such an opportunity for applying this test as\r\nmay never occur again. This test formulated itself in my mind, in this\r\nshape: “Did any of the nations or tribes of the aboriginal inhabitants\r\nof this continent have a word in their language indicating a horse?”\r\nWhen in California I applied to Mr. Bancroft, the compiler and publisher\r\nof the great documentary history of the Pacific coast, who then had a\r\nlarge corps of skilled translators at work on his famous compilation, and\r\nsubmitted my question. He introduced me to his principal linguist, who\r\nknew not only Spanish, English and other modern languages, but also the\r\nlanguage of the Indians of the coast, the mountains and the plains, of\r\nthe period covered by the question. The question did not seem to be new\r\nto him, and he answered with the candor and conscientiousness of a man\r\nwho knew what he was saying, that there was no word in any of the Indian\r\ntongues, ancient or modern, that represented the horse. This settled the\r\nquestion of the supposed prehistoric character and rank of the horse, and\r\nwe are thus driven to accept the infinitesimally small number left behind\r\nby Cortez, Nunez and De Soto as the seed from which sprang the countless\r\nthousands of wild horses that for generations roamed the Western plains.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Conquest of Mexico is full of blood and cruelty, but\r\nas we have nothing to do with any part of the story except so much\r\nof it as relates to the introduction of the horse to the continent of\r\nNorth America, it will require but small space to tell it. Cortez sailed\r\nfrom Cuba for Yucatan, February, 1519, with an army of six hundred and\r\nsixty-three men, two hundred Indians and sixteen horses. This wholly\r\ninadequate supply of cavalry was the weak place in his venture, but the\r\nhorses could not be had in Cuba, without paying an incredible price.\r\nThose he was able to secure cost from four to five hundred _pesos de oro_\r\neach. The _peso_ was the Spanish dollar. The expedition was nominally\r\nfitted out for Yucatan, but its real aim was the heart of Mexico. In\r\nhis first fight with the Indians near the coast, men mounted on horses\r\nwere feared by the natives as monstrous apparitions. This overwhelming\r\nfear of the horse may seem to some of my readers as overdone by the\r\nhistorian, but it seems to have been the common experience of all the\r\ndifferent nations and tribes of Indians wherever the horse made his first\r\nappearance in battle. In the first battle two of the horses were killed,\r\nand in the second another was killed, and all that remained were more or\r\nless severely wounded. Cortez was afterward joined by Alvarado, at Vera\r\nCruz, with twenty horses and one hundred and fifty men. In making his\r\nofficial reports directly to the home government in Spain instead of the\r\ngovernor of Cuba, Cortez gave mortal offense to that dignitary, and he\r\nsent out an armada under Narvaez to supersede Cortez and return him in\r\nchains to Cuba. This armada consisted of eighteen vessels, carrying nine\r\nhundred men, eighty of whom were cavalry. After some diplomacy, Cortez,\r\nfeeling that with his little handful of men he was wholly unable to meet\r\nNarvaez, he did all he could to avoid a conflict. Each party knew the\r\nexact strength of the other, and as Narvaez began to threaten, Cortez\r\ndetermined to fight for his rights and his liberty. He then had but five\r\nmen mounted, but he took advantage of the carelessness of his adversary,\r\nmade a night attack in the midst of a tempest, and captured Narvaez and\r\nhis whole army. The private soldiers of that day, like their commanders,\r\nhad no idea or principle to fight for except for plunder, and they\r\nwere always ready to attach themselves to the most successful robber.\r\nCortez was their ideal leader, and at once he had a new army of devoted\r\nfollowers. He then had eighty-five mounted men, and he felt strong enough\r\nto hold and rule the great country he had conquered. Mexico was conquered\r\nin 1521, and the news of the vast amount of treasure captured brought\r\na great crowd of emigrants from Spain and from all her dominions.\r\nThe Spaniards, like other nations of Southern Europe, kept their\r\nhorses entire and whenever representatives of both sexes strayed away,\r\nreproduction would follow. As the country became more tranquil, and as\r\nthe tide of European settlers kept pouring in, we can easily understand\r\nhow the little bands of estrays should grow into larger bands and soon\r\nbecome as wild as though they had never seen a human being except to flee\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nThe explorer De Soto sailed for Florida in 1539, in search of gold. He\r\nhad in his command five hundred and thirteen men, exclusive of sailors,\r\nand two hundred and thirty-seven horses, besides some for the purpose of\r\nbearing burdens, the number not given. In all his weary journey of three\r\nyears he found the Indians active, hostile, and courageous fighters. In\r\none of his first battles he lost twelve horses, and had seventy wounded.\r\nHe pursued many phantoms in search of gold, in different directions,\r\nbut his general course was westward and northwestward. He was the first\r\nEuropean to discover the Mississippi River, not far from the mouth of\r\nthe Arkansas, and there he was buried in the middle of the river, to\r\nprevent the Indians from discovering he was dead and from desecrating his\r\nremains. His followers then determined to push on westward to Mexico,\r\nand reached as far as the borders of Texas, probably, when they became\r\ndiscouraged with the magnitude of the difficulties that surrounded\r\nthem, and determined to return and seek an outlet from the wilderness\r\nby water. On this last journey, west of the Mississippi, they suffered\r\ntheir greatest loss of horses. They had not been shod for more than a\r\nyear, and a great many were lame and unable to travel. When the Spaniards\r\nhad completed their boats and were ready to leave the scenes of their\r\nsufferings and disasters, they turned loose upon the bank of the river\r\ntheir four or five remaining horses, which manifested great excitement,\r\nrunning up and down the bank neighing for their masters, as they sailed\r\naway. This alarmed the Indians and they ran into the water for safety.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were afraid of the horses and the horses were afraid of the\r\nIndians. It seems to be a fact, observed in all the early intercourse\r\nof the Spaniards with the Indians, that universally they had a kind of\r\nsuperstitious awe of the horse as a superior being, and it is probably\r\ndue to this awe that the Indians did not utterly destroy every horse that\r\nfell out of the ranks or that escaped in the wilderness. As I understand\r\nthe history of this terrible exploration, when the Spaniards crossed the\r\nMississippi they had two hundred and fifty men and one hundred and fifty\r\nhorses, and when they came back and were ready to sail they had but four\r\nor five horses left. It is fair, therefore, to conclude that the greater\r\nportion of these hundred and fifty head was scattered in the wilderness\r\nas they went out and as they returned. This provides a sufficient\r\nbreeding basis for the countless multitudes of descendants, and places\r\nthat nucleus in the right region to nourish them in a feral state.\r\n\r\nWhile this exploration of De Soto seems to furnish a breeding basis of\r\nsufficient breadth to account for all the wild horses that have appeared\r\non this continent, there is another consideration that we must not\r\noverlook, and that is the inborn tendency of the domestic horse to become\r\nwild when in wild associations. By turning to the chapter on the colony\r\nof Virginia you will see that there were many wild horses there at the\r\nbeginning of the last century. On the frontiers, near the habitat of\r\nwild horses, they became a great nuisance to the settlers in “coaxing”\r\naway their domestic horses and making them as wild as the wildest. These\r\naccretions to their strength from the domestic horse have been going\r\non for generations, and thus the wild horse became conglomerate in\r\nthe elements of his blood, with the Spanish traits still predominant.\r\nFifty or a hundred years ago the pens of many writers were employed\r\nin idealizing “The Wild Horse of the Desert.” He was made the leading\r\nfigure in many a romance, and the hero of many a triumph. Tom Thumb,\r\nthe great trotter that was taken to England, astonished all the world\r\nwith his speed and his endurance, and, following the fashion of the day,\r\nhe was represented to have been caught wild on the Western plains. For\r\nmany years the wild horse was the “fad” of American writers, just as the\r\nArabian was of English writers, and the writers on one side were just\r\nabout as far from intelligence and truth as those on the other. When,\r\nforty years ago, great droves of the half-breeds, Mustangs, were brought\r\nfrom the plains to the border prairie States, seeking a market, the\r\nscales began to drop from the eyes of the worshipers of the wild horse.\r\nThey were homely little brutes, and they were as tough as whit-leather.\r\nBut the countless multitudes that roamed at will over their grazing\r\ngrounds, making the earth tremble when they moved, have dwindled down to\r\na few insignificant bands, and the whole glamour around the wild horse of\r\nthe desert has vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER AND HIS ANCESTORS.\r\n\r\n    Messenger the greatest of all trotting progenitors—Record of\r\n    pedigrees in English Stud Book—Pedigrees made from unreliable\r\n    sources—Messenger’s right male line examined—Flying Guilders’\r\n    “mile in a minute”—Blaze short of being thoroughbred—Sampson,\r\n    a good race horse—His size; short in his breeding—Engineer\r\n    short also—Mambrino was a race horse with at least two pacing\r\n    crosses: distinguished only as a progenitor of coach horses and\r\n    fast trotters—Messenger’s dam cannot be traced nor identified—\r\n    Among all the horses claiming to be thoroughbred he is the only\r\n    one that founded a family of trotters—This fact conceded by\r\n    eminent writers in attempting to find others.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving completed a brief historical sketch of horse history from the\r\nbeginning, and many events connected therewith, we are now ready to\r\nconsider the American Trotting Horse, as the culmination of what has been\r\nwritten. Thus far we have met with much pretentious nonsense, claiming to\r\nbe history and written by men who never gave the subject the study of an\r\nhonest hour. The horse is honest enough, but the rule seems to be almost\r\nuniversal that whenever men commence to write about him they are guided\r\nby their imagination and not by the facts. As to what we are to meet in\r\nthe coming chapters, I can only say that, unfortunately, “the fathers\r\nhave eaten sour grapes and the children’s teeth are set on edge.” The\r\ninstinct to misrepresent has been transmitted, and I cannot promise that\r\nwe will find any great moral improvement among the horsemen of our own\r\ncountry and generation.\r\n\r\nFor more than three-quarters of a century, and indeed from the first\r\ntrotting experiences of this country that have been preserved, it\r\nhas been the unanimous judgment of all who have given any thought or\r\nattention to the subject that the imported English horse, Messenger, was\r\nthe great central source of trotting speed. As the years have rolled by\r\nthis opinion has increased in strength until it has become an intelligent\r\nand demonstrated belief. When, forty years ago, a horse was found able\r\nto trot a mile in two minutes and thirty seconds, the speed was deemed\r\nwholly phenomenal, but that speed has been increased, second by second,\r\nuntil we are now on the very brink of two minutes. In this process every\r\nsecond and fraction of a second that has been cut off has been so much\r\nadditional proof of the universal belief that Messenger was the chief\r\nprogenitor of the American trotter. He is not the only source of trotting\r\nspeed, but he is the chief source. Whence he derived this distinctive\r\npower to transmit trotting speed will be made more clear as we proceed.\r\nHis blood left no deep nor lasting impress upon the running horses of the\r\ncountry, and it is seldom we meet with any trace of it in the running\r\nhorse of to-day, but it is prominent and conspicuous at the winning post\r\nof every trotting track on this continent. This will be made apparent\r\nwhen we come to consider the details and the merits of the mighty tribes\r\nand families that have descended from him.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago I promised to write a volume on “Messenger and his\r\nDescendants,” and I have often been reminded of that unfulfilled\r\npromise, which I will here try to redeem. When that promise was made I\r\nhad written many things about Messenger, but since then I have secured\r\nvery many valuable facts that, I think, will far more than compensate\r\nfor the delay. There is still much that is unknown and much that is only\r\npartially known of the origin and history of Messenger and his ancestors,\r\nand in considering the questions that will arise as the discussion\r\nprogresses, I will not submit to a slavish acceptance of whatever has\r\ncome down in the shape of stallion advertisements, or as unsupported\r\ntraditions, and then recorded as facts by people who knew nothing about\r\nthem, and made no effort to know. I shall look for the facts that are\r\nknown to be facts, or such evidence as is reasonable and commends itself\r\nto an unbiased judgment, and then reach such conclusions as right reason\r\nshall dictate. The pedigree of Messenger, or rather the pedigree of\r\nMessenger’s reputed grandam, appears in the English Stud Book in the\r\neditions of 1803 and 1827, in the following form:\r\n\r\n  REGULUS MARE (Sister to Figurante). Her dam by Starling, out of\r\n  Snap’s dam.\r\n    1769, b. f. by Herod (dam of _Alert_).            }\r\n    1770, bl. c. _Hyacinth_, by Turf.                 } Mr. Vernon.\r\n    1771, bl. c. _Leviathan_ (aft. Mungo), by Marske.   Lord Abingdon.\r\n    1773, — f. by Turf.                               }\r\n    1774, — f. by Ditto (dam of _Messenger_).         }\r\n    1777, bl. f. by Dux.                              } Lord Grosvenor.\r\n    1780, b. f. by Justice (dam of _Equity_).         }\r\n    1782, b. c. Vulcan, by Justice.                     Mr. Panton.\r\n    1783, b. c. _Savage_, by Sweetbriar.              }\r\n    1784, b. f. _Ariel_, by Highflyer (dam of Mr.     } Mr. Bullock.\r\n                  Hamilton’s Swindler, by Bagot).     }\r\n\r\nThis is all we have of the pedigree of Messenger as recorded in the\r\nEnglish Stud Book, and this record, on its face, has a very suspicious\r\nappearance. Messenger had run some races at Newmarket and a place must be\r\nprovided for him in the Stud Book. He always ran as a son of Mambrino,\r\nand there is no doubt this is correct, as it so appeared in the Racing\r\nCalendar, long before the days of the Stud Book. But nobody, either then\r\nor later, seemed to know anything about his dam. Toward the close of this\r\nchapter I will give an exhaustive review of the many troubles in which\r\nthese two fillies by Turf seem to be involved.\r\n\r\nMessenger was by Mambrino, he by Engineer, he by Sampson, he by Blaze, he\r\nby Flying Childers, and he by the Darley Arabian. We give the right male\r\nline here for the reason that there can be no doubt as to the accuracy of\r\nthis line, for it has been preserved in contemporaneous racing records.\r\nThe trouble, where any trouble exists, is all with the dams of these\r\nhorses which at best are only matters of the most uncertain tradition. A\r\nwriter in the Edinburgh _Review_ for July, 1864, covers the whole ground\r\nwhen he says: “The early pedigrees (in the Stud Book) are but little to\r\nbe relied upon, as they seem for the most part to have been taken from\r\ntraditional accounts in the stable, from descriptions at the back of\r\nold pictures, and from advertisements, none of which had to pass muster\r\nat the Herald’s College.” This is in full accordance with our American\r\nexperiences and it is entirely safe to say that the great body of our old\r\nAmerican pedigrees, especially in their remote extensions, are more or\r\nless fictitious. The industry of producing great pedigrees out of little\r\nor nothing has long been pursued on both sides of the water, and it would\r\nbe very difficult to determine which side had the better of it.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to analyze the pedigree of Messenger, or rather that\r\nof his dam, with which the chief difficulty lies, we will go back to\r\nthe head of the male line and consider each successive generation. The\r\nDarley Arabian, one of the most distinguished of all the founders of the\r\nEnglish thoroughbred horse, was brought from Aleppo, about the year\r\n1710. He did not cover many mares except those of his owner in Yorkshire,\r\nbut he was very successful. Childers, commonly called Flying Childers,\r\nwas foaled 1715. He was got by the Darley Arabian out of Betty Leeds,\r\na distinguished lightweight runner, by Careless. Childers was the most\r\ndistinguished race horse of his day, and the fabulous story of his having\r\nrun a mile in a minute was circulated, believed and written about for\r\ngenerations. He ran a trial against Almanzor and Brown Betty over the\r\nround course at Newmarket (three miles, six furlongs and ninety-three\r\nyards) in six minutes and forty seconds, “and it was thought,” says the\r\nold record, “that he moved eighty-two feet and a half in a second of\r\ntime, which is nearly at the rate of one mile in a minute.” This was the\r\nbasis of the legend “A Mile in a Minute,” and it has lived till our own\r\nday, just as many a traditional pedigree has lived. If we accept the time\r\nas given by the old chroniclers, of which we have very grave doubts,\r\nChilders ran at the rate of one minute and forty-five seconds to the\r\nmile, and he covered a distance of fifty feet and about two inches to the\r\nsecond of time. The pedigree of Childers on the maternal side is one of\r\nthe oldest in the Stud Book, and we are not aware that any charges have\r\never been made against its substantial authenticity.\r\n\r\nBLAZE, the son of Childers, was foaled 1733, and was out of a mare known\r\nas “The Confederate Filly,” by Grey Grantham; her dam was by the Duke of\r\nRutland’s Black Barb, and her grandam was a mare of unknown breeding,\r\ncalled “Bright’s Roan.” Here the maternal line runs into the woods, but\r\nthis is not the only defect in the pedigree, for the dam of Grey Grantham\r\nwas also unknown. In order to give a clear idea of just how Blaze was\r\nbred, taking the Stud Book for our authority, we will here tabulate the\r\npedigree for a few crosses.\r\n\r\n                               { Darley Arabian\r\n           { Childers          {                 { Careless.\r\n           {                   { Betty Leeds     { Sister to Leeds.\r\n  Blaze    {\r\n  (1733).  {                                     { Browlow Turk.\r\n           {                   { Grey Grantham   { Blood unknown.\r\n           { Confederate Filly {\r\n                               { Daughter of     { Black Barb.\r\n                                                 { Brights Roan, unknown.\r\n\r\nCertainly this horse cannot be ranked as thoroughbred under any\r\nrule, English or American, that has ever been formulated. Only three\r\ngenerations away we find two animals of hopelessly unknown breeding.\r\nMr. Henry F. Euren, compiler of the English Hackney Stud Book, has given\r\nBlaze a new place in horse genealogy, and this new place affects the\r\nAmerican trotter, remotely, outside of the line through Messenger. Mr.\r\nLawrence, the best English authority on horse matters in the latter part\r\nof the last and the beginning of the present century, had maintained,\r\nconfessedly on tradition only, that Old Shales, the great fountain head\r\nof the English trotters of a hundred years ago, was a son of Blank, by\r\nGodolphin Arabian. On this point Mr. Euren has got farther back and found\r\nearlier evidence in printed form that Blaze and not Blank was the sire of\r\nOld Shales. We combated this claim for a time, but in the introduction\r\nto his Stud Book he has made out a very good case, and we have hardly a\r\ndoubt but that he is correct. In speaking of the breeding of Shales, and\r\nof his dam being a “strong common-bred mare,” he says: “It is of interest\r\nto examine the pedigree of the sire (Blaze) to determine whether yet\r\nstronger racing or pacing elements existed on that side.” After giving a\r\ntabulation of the pedigree he continues: “There would thus appear to have\r\nbeen a large proportion of English (native) blood in the dam of Blaze,\r\nthough no one can say what was its character—whether running, trotting,\r\nor ambling.” In referring to the fact that Bellfounder was a descendant\r\nof Old Shales, the son of Blaze, Mr. Euren makes this practical\r\napplication of the incident:\r\n\r\n    “The fact that in the seventh generation from Blaze, on each\r\n    side, the reunion of the blood in Rysdyk’s Hambletonian, the\r\n    sire of so many fast American trotting horses, should have\r\n    proved to be of the most impressive character, would appear to\r\n    warrant the conclusion that there was a strong latent trotting\r\n    tendency in the near ancestors, on one, if not on both, sides\r\n    of Blaze.”\r\n\r\nThese two points from a very high English authority—that Blaze was\r\nnot thoroughbred and that he was the sire of Shales, a great trotting\r\nprogenitor, must have due weight in reaching sound conclusions.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON, the son of Blaze, was foaled 1745, and he has occupied a very\r\nprominent and at the same time unique place in running-horse history. He\r\nwas not only a great race horse, at heavy weights, but he was considered\r\nphenomenal in his size and strength, and in his lack of the appearance\r\nof a race horse. Some of his measurements have come down to us, and as\r\nthey are reliable data as to what was considered a remarkably large and\r\nstrong race horse a hundred and forty years ago, we will reproduce them\r\nhere in order that the curious may compare them with the average race\r\nhorse of this generation:\r\n\r\n    Height on the withers, 15 hands 2 inches; dimensions of fore\r\n    leg from the hair of the hoof to middle of fetlock joint, 4\r\n    inches; from fetlock joint to bend of the knee, 11 inches; from\r\n    bend of knee to elbow, 19 inches; round fore leg below knee,\r\n    narrowest part, 8½ inches; round hind leg, narrowest part, 9\r\n    inches.\r\n\r\nThese measurements may not seem to merit any particular attention at this\r\nday, but a hundred and fifty years ago they were considered phenomenal\r\nin the race horse. But we are not left to the dry details of a certain\r\nnumber of inches and fractions of an inch upon which to base a just\r\nconception of the strength and substance of this horse. A number of\r\nhistorians have told us of the merriment among the grooms and jockeys\r\nwhen Sampson made his first appearance on the turf. The question was,\r\n“Has Mr. Robinson brought a coach horse here to run for the plate?” The\r\nlaugh was on the other side at Malton that day, however, when the “coach\r\nhorse,” carrying one hundred and forty pounds, won the plate in three\r\nheats. The distance was three miles, and Sampson was then five years old.\r\nAt long distances and at high weights Sampson was a first-class race\r\nhorse for his day. But, notwithstanding all this, we are told that his\r\nblood never became fashionable, for there was a widespread conviction\r\nthat he was not running-bred on the side of his dam. The historians tell\r\nus that he transmitted his own coarseness and lack of the true running\r\ntype in a marked degree, which was very evident in his grandson, Mambrino.\r\n\r\nHis pedigree has been questioned from the day of his first appearance\r\nto the present time, and we have made a very careful study of all the\r\nfacts at our command. In the first edition of his Stud Book (1803) Mr.\r\nWeatherby gives his dam as by Hip; g. d. by Spark, son of Honeycomb\r\nPunch; g. g. d. by Snake and out of Lord D’Arcy’s Queen. This has not\r\nbeen materially changed in any of the subsequent editions, and we think\r\nit may be taken for granted that the horse was advertised under this\r\npedigree. Mr. Weatherby commenced work on pedigrees in 1791, and avowedly\r\naccepted the best information he could get with regard to old pedigrees,\r\nregardless of the source. We are not aware that he ever investigated\r\nanything outside of his office work, or if he did he never gave the\r\npublic the benefit of the details of his investigations. John Lawrence\r\ncommenced work on horse history long before Mr. Weatherby commenced\r\nas a compiler of pedigrees, and he was altogether the ablest writer\r\nof his day, or perhaps we might add, of any other day. He was a clear\r\nand independent thinker and a vigorous writer. In his “History of the\r\nHorse in all His Varieties and Uses,” on page 281, he thus discusses the\r\nquestion of Sampson’s pedigree:\r\n\r\n    “Nobody yet ever did, or ever could assert positively that\r\n    Jigg was not thoroughbred, but the case is very different with\r\n    respect to Sampson; since nobody in the sporting world, either\r\n    of past or present days, ever supposed him so. Nor was the said\r\n    world at all surprised at Robinson’s people furnishing their\r\n    stallion with a good and _true_ pedigree, a thing so much to\r\n    their advantage. Having seen a number of Sampson’s immediate\r\n    get, those in the Lord Marquis of Rockingham’s stud and others,\r\n    and all of them, Bay Malton perhaps less than any other, in\r\n    their _heads_, size and form, having the appearance of being a\r\n    degree or two deficient in racing blood, I was convinced that\r\n    the then universal opinion on that point was well grounded. I\r\n    was (in 1778) an enthusiast, collecting materials for a book\r\n    on the horse. It happened that I wanted a trusty and steady\r\n    man for a particular service, and opportunely for the matter\r\n    now under discussion, a Yorkshire man about threescore years\r\n    of age was recommended to me, who had recently been employed\r\n    in certain stables. I soon found that his early life had been\r\n    spent in the running stables of the North, and that he had\r\n    known Sampson, whence he was always afterward named by us ‘Old\r\n    Sampson.’ He was very intelligent on the subject of racing\r\n    stock and his report was as follows. He took the mare to Blaze,\r\n    for the cover which produced Sampson, helped to bit and break\r\n    the colt, rode him in exercise and afterward took him to Malton\r\n    for his first start, where, before the race, he was ridiculed\r\n    for bringing a great coach horse to contend against racers. On\r\n    the sale of Sampson this man left the service of James Preston,\r\n    Esq., and went with the colt into that of Mr. Robinson. His\r\n    account of Sampson’s dam was that she appeared about three\r\n    parts bred, a hunting figure and by report a daughter of Hip,\r\n    which, however, could not be authenticated; and the fact was\r\n    then notorious and not disputed in the Yorkshire stables....\r\n    Mr. Tattersall lately stowed me a portrait of Sampson in his\r\n    flesh, in which this defect of blood appears far more obvious\r\n    than in one which I had of him galloping.”\r\n\r\nAgain, in his great quarto work, issued 1809, Mr. Lawrence reiterates his\r\nbelief that Sampson was not thoroughbred. He says:\r\n\r\n    “I am by no means disposed to retract my opinion concerning\r\n    Robinson’s Sampson. Not only did the account of the groom\r\n    appear to me to be entitled to credit, but the internal\r\n    evidence of the horse’s having had in him a cross of common\r\n    blood is sufficiently strong by the appearance both of the\r\n    horse himself and of his stock; an idea in which every\r\n    sportsman, I believe, who remembers Engineer, Mambrino and\r\n    others will agree with me.”\r\n\r\nHere then, we have the answer to the whole inquiry reduced to its\r\nsimplest form. The groom who coupled the mare with Blaze from which\r\ncame Sampson says the mare was called a Hip mare, but that her pedigree\r\nwas really unknown. For the intelligence and honesty of this groom Mr.\r\nLawrence does not hesitate to vouch, and he adds the common belief of\r\nall the Yorkshire sportsmen of that day, who knew the mare, that she was\r\nof unknown breeding. This evidence is further supplemented by the family\r\ncharacteristics of the stock descended from Sampson, to say nothing\r\nof the great lack of “blood” in the appearance of Sampson himself. As\r\nagainst this we have the dry, unsupported assertion of Mr. Weatherby,\r\nforty years after the event, and probably copied from an advertisement of\r\nthe horse. In view of all this we must tabulate the pedigree of Sampson\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                               { Childers          { Darley Arabian.\r\n                               {                   { Betty Leeds.\r\n           { Blaze             {\r\n  Sampson  {                   { Confederate Filly { Grey Grantham.\r\n  (1745).  {                                       { D. of Black Barb.\r\n           { Called a Hip Mare\r\n           { (Unknown).\r\n\r\nENGINEER, son of Sampson, was a brown horse, foaled 1755, and was out\r\nof Miner’s dam, by Young Greyhound; grandam by Curwen’s Bay Barb, and\r\nthe next dam unknown. This is all the pedigree that has ever been\r\neven claimed for this horse, and it falls far short of the rank of\r\nthoroughbred. That the eye may take it all in at a glance we will here\r\nput it into tabular form. There is a discrepancy of one year between\r\nWeatherby and Pick in the age of the horse, and we find Pick is right in\r\ngiving his date as 1755.\r\n\r\n                               { Blaze             { Childers.\r\n           { Sampson           {                   { Confederate Filly.\r\n  Engineer {                   { Unknown.\r\n  (1755).  {\r\n           { Miner’s dam       { Young Greyhound   { Greyhound.\r\n                               {                   { Pet mare.\r\n                               {\r\n                               { D. of Bay Barb    { Unknown.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the absence of Eastern blood, Engineer was a race horse\r\nof above average ability, although not so good as another son of Sampson\r\ncalled Bay Malton. A few of his sons aside from Mambrino ran respectably,\r\nand his daughters were, at one time, highly prized as brood mares.\r\n\r\nMAMBRINO, the son of Engineer, was a great strong-boned grey horse, bred\r\nby John Atkinson near Leeds in Yorkshire, and was foaled 1768. His dam\r\nwas by Cade, son of the Godolphin Arabian; g. d. by Bolton Little John;\r\ng. g. d. Favorite by a son of Bald Galloway, etc. The Cade mare produced\r\nDulcine, a noted performer, and the mare Favorite was a distinguished\r\nperformer herself. The poverty of this pedigree is all on the side of the\r\nsire, as will be seen by a brief tabulation.\r\n\r\n                                                   { Blaze.\r\n           { Engineer          { Sampson           { Unknown.\r\n           {                   {\r\n           {                   {                   { Young Greyhound.\r\n  Mambrino {                   { Miner’s dam       { D. of Bay Barb.\r\n  (1768).  {\r\n           {                                       { Godolphin Arabian.\r\n           {                   { Cade              { Roxana.\r\n           { Daughter of       {\r\n                               {                   { Bolton Little John.\r\n                               { Daughter of       { Favorite.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note here, as a curious fact, that Mambrino had two\r\npacing crosses. Roxana, the dam of Cade, was by Bald Galloway and\r\nFavorite was by a son of Bald Galloway. This horse Bald Galloway was a\r\ndistinguished representative of the famous old tribe of pacers known as\r\nthe “Galloways,” from the province of Galloway in Southwestern Scotland.\r\n\r\nMambrino was not put upon the turf till he was five years old, and he\r\nproved himself a great race horse in the best company and for the largest\r\nclass of stakes. He was on the turf most of the time for five or six\r\nyears and until he was beaten by Woodpecker in 1779, in which race he\r\nbroke down. He was beaten, but four times, and paid four forfeits. He\r\nwent into the stud in the spring of 1777, although he ran after that, at\r\n10gs. 10s. 6d. to cover thirty mares besides those of his owners. In 1779\r\nhe was again in the stud, in Cambridgeshire as before, at the same price;\r\n1781 he covered at 50gs. 10. 6d.; 1784 at 15gs. 10. 6d.; 1785 at 25gs.\r\n10s. 6d.; 1786 he dropped back to 15gs. 10s. 6d.\r\n\r\nWe give these prices to show the variations in the estimated value of\r\nhis services. As a sire of race horses Mambrino was not successful. Some\r\nfifteen or twenty of his progeny ran more or less respectably, but none\r\nof them was at all comparable with himself. While he was a comparative\r\nfailure as a racing sire there was another qualification in which he\r\nattained great eminence and distinction. In the second volume of Pick’s\r\nTurf Register, published 1805, on page 266, we find the following\r\nparagraph appended to the history there given of this horse:\r\n\r\n    “Mambrino was likewise sire of a great many excellent hunters\r\n    and strong, useful road horses. And it has been said that from\r\n    his blood the breed of horses for the coach was brought nearly\r\n    to perfection.”\r\n\r\nThis paragraph, considering its date (1805), the authority from which\r\nit comes, and the peculiar circumstances which prompted its utterance,\r\nhas a most striking significance. After years of familiarity with Mr.\r\nPick’s works we can say freely that we never have been able to find any\r\nallusion or reference to the qualities of any horse portrayed by him\r\nother than his running qualities. This reference to the adaptabilities of\r\nthe progeny of Mambrino stands alone. The “blood that brought the breed\r\nof coach horses nearly to perfection” must have been blood that gave\r\nthe “breed” a long, slinging, road-devouring trot, as well as size and\r\nstrength. The very same qualifications were observed and noted in the\r\ndescendants of Mambrino in this country forty and fifty years ago, and at\r\nno time in our history have we had such unapproachable coach horses as\r\nthe great-grandsons of Mambrino. What has been said, therefore, by Mr.\r\nPick of the “coach-horse” qualities of the descendants of Mambrino in\r\nEngland has been fully realized and verified in his descendants, through\r\nMessenger, in this country.\r\n\r\nThe question here arises whether Mambrino ever showed any remarkable\r\ntrotting action himself that would seem to justify this estimate of the\r\ntrotting action of his descendants? Several writers, and among them Mr.\r\nLawrence, have spoken of this peculiarity of Mambrino’s incidentally,\r\nbut the most tangible account we have of it is furnished by an English\r\nwriter to the _Sporting Magazine_, who dates his letter from the\r\n“Subscription Rooms, Tattersall’s, 1814.” These “subscription rooms”\r\nwere the very focus of sporting events, and this writer seems to be\r\nunusually intelligent on this class of subjects. The object and point\r\nof his communication is to prove that no thoroughbred horse could be\r\ndeveloped into a fast trotter. “Hence,” he says, “no thoroughbred was\r\never known capable of trotting sixteen miles within the hour, and only\r\none stands on record as having trotted fifteen miles within one hour.\r\nThat was Infidel, by Turk, who performed it in the North, carrying\r\nnine or ten stone. Several race horses have been supposed capable of\r\ntrotting fourteen miles in one hour, and it is reported that the late\r\nLord Grosvenor once offered to match Mambrino to do it for a thousand\r\nguineas.” Now this writer does not say that Lord Grosvenor really made\r\nsuch an offer, but only that he was “reported” to have made it. This\r\ndoes not prove that the offer was formally made, but it does prove that\r\nMambrino had a very remarkable trotting step or such a topic would not\r\nhave been considered at Tattersall’s subscription rooms. As this writer\r\nseems to refer to Mambrino and Infidel only as exceptional horses for\r\ntheir trotting step among thoroughbreds, we may take it for granted that\r\nMambrino was considered exceptional, in his day. It is not probable that\r\nhe was ever trained an hour at the trot, and we must conclude, therefore,\r\nthat whatever speed he showed was his natural and undeveloped gait. It\r\nwill be observed that Mr. Pick’s paragraph was dated 1805, and the letter\r\nfrom the “subscription rooms” 1814, so that they could not have been mere\r\nreflections of theories advanced on this side of the Atlantic in relation\r\nto Messenger being a great source of trotting speed. These two facts\r\nwere on record long before any “Messenger theories” were in existence,\r\nand those “theories” were formulated long before these two facts were\r\nknown. The conclusions reached on both sides of the water are entirely\r\nharmonious, but they were reached in complete independence of each other.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER, son of Mambrino, was a grey horse about fifteen hands two\r\ninches high, with strong, heavy bone and a generally coarse appearance\r\nfor a horse represented to be thoroughbred. From the Racing Calendar, and\r\nnot from the Stud Book, we learn that he was foaled 1780, and came out\r\nof a mare represented to be by Turf, and she out of a mare by Regulus,\r\nson of Godolphin Arabian, etc., as represented by Mr. Weatherby in his\r\nStud Book. By looking back to the beginning of this chapter the form in\r\nwhich the entry appears in the Stud Book will be fully comprehended. The\r\nidentity, history, and breeding of the dam of Messenger is the central\r\npoint in this inquiry, and we must do our work carefully and thoroughly.\r\nFrom the form of the entry in the Stud Book, it will be understood that\r\nthe breeder of each animal is supposed to appear opposite the foals\r\nof his own breeding, but this we have found in more than a thousand\r\ninstances to be wholly imaginary on the part of the compiler. If the\r\nanimal ran, the name of the party running him is far more apt to appear\r\nthan the name of the breeder. It will be observed, also, that the Turf\r\nfillies of 1773 and 1774 appear without their color being known. These\r\nfillies seem to be put in there to partially fill the gap between 1771\r\nand 1777. Mr. Pick says the dam of Messenger was black, but he gives no\r\naccount of her further than that. Whether Mr. Pick was indebted to Mr.\r\nWeatherby, or Weatherby to Pick, I cannot say, but they both give the\r\npedigree just as we have given it in this country. I am not inquiring\r\nwhether these authorities agree on this pedigree, but whether they knew\r\nanything about it, and whether there is such agreement in details between\r\nthem as will support each other.\r\n\r\nThe first question that arises in every man’s mind is, whether there is\r\nany further trace of this Turf mare, the reputed dam of Messenger, in\r\nthe Stud Book, by whom was she bred and owned, and by whom was Messenger\r\nbred? Pick says the Turf mare was bred by Lord Bolingbroke, and Weatherby\r\nsays she was bred by Lord Grosvenor. To test the question whether either\r\nis right, I have gone through the English Stud Book, page by page, and\r\npedigree by pedigree, wherever I found the name of Lord Bolingbroke, or\r\nLord Grosvenor, to see if any trace of the Turf mare could be found. I\r\nfound no shadow of trace. The certificate of pedigree that came across\r\nthe ocean with Messenger represents him to have been bred by John\r\nPratt, and Mr. Pick, or rather his successor, Mr. Johnson, says he was\r\nbred and owned by Mr. Bullock. These clear and explicit declarations\r\ngave new hopes of finding something of the Turf mare, and at it I went\r\nagain, and searched every pedigree that had the name of Mr. Pratt or Mr.\r\nBullock attached to it, with no better results than before. Now, Lord\r\nBolingbroke, Lord Grosvenor, Mr. Pratt and Mr. Bullock were all breeders,\r\nand if any of them ever owned the dam of Messenger and bred from her,\r\nnone of her produce was ever recorded or ever started in a race.\r\n\r\nThus, the more we search for the truth about Messenger and his origin,\r\nthe more dense becomes the mystery. When we find an English authority\r\nthat seems clear, we find another that contradicts him, and probably\r\nneither of them knows anything about it beyond uncertain tradition. When\r\nwe consider these contradictions of authorities in connection with the\r\nfact that men were just as prone to lie and fix up a bogus pedigree a\r\nhundred years ago as they are to-day, and that stud-book makers were just\r\nas liable to be deceived then as now, we must conclude that there is room\r\nfor very serious doubts as to whether Weatherby or Pick knew anything\r\nabout the pedigree of Messenger, or by whom he was bred.\r\n\r\nIn pushing our inquiries still further in search of this mare, we must\r\nconsider somewhat in detail Mr. Weatherby’s methods and the degree of\r\nresponsibility he assumed for the accuracy of his compilations. In 1791\r\nhe published what he called “An Introduction to a General Stud Book,”\r\ncontaining, as he says, “a small collection of pedigrees which he had\r\nextracted from racing calendars and sale papers, and arranged on a\r\nnew plan.” In May, 1800, he issued a supplement to his “Introduction”\r\nbringing down the produce of mares to 1799. In 1803 he issued what we\r\nsuppose is the first edition of the first volume of the Stud Book. The\r\ntitle-page reads, “The General Stud Book, containing pedigrees of race\r\nhorses, etc., from the Restoration to the present time.” The imprint is,\r\n“Printed for James Weatherby, 7 Oxenden Street, etc., London, 1803.” The\r\nvolume contains three hundred and eighty-four pages, while the edition\r\nof 1827 contains four hundred and forty-eight pages. There is no “Volume\r\nI.” on the title-page, nor is there any indication that this is a\r\ncontinuation or revision of any preceding work. It brings down the list\r\nof produce in many cases to and including 1803, but none later than that\r\nyear, so there can be no mistake as to when it was issued.\r\n\r\nI have been thus particular in identifying this first edition of the\r\nfirst volume of the English Stud Book, for it gives us an insight into\r\nthe methods employed by Mr. Weatherby in the progress of his work.\r\nUpon a careful comparison of the editions of 1803 with 1827 extending\r\nthrough the letters A, B, and M, we find that he has thrown out more\r\nthan ten per cent. of the entire families in the edition of 1803. By\r\n“entire families” I mean brood mares, with their lists of produce. In\r\nmaking these exclusions he seems to have confined himself to what may be\r\nconsidered the historic period, at that day, and did not go back further\r\nthan about twenty years. Beyond that period everything was traditional,\r\nand he appears to have shrunk from all responsibility of attempting the\r\nexclusion of families. On and near the border line between these periods\r\nhe seems to have taken the responsibility of cutting off a great many\r\nindividuals of doubtful identity, even though the family was left to\r\nstand on its uncertain basis of tradition. I cannot say positively that\r\nthe dam of Messenger and her sister were cut off with the multitude\r\nof others, but I can say that neither of them ever appeared again in\r\nthe Stud Book. Other members of the family of the Regulus mare have\r\nplaces for their descendants in subsequent volumes, from which I would\r\ninfer that Mr. Weatherby considered her breeding all right, but the two\r\nfillies, one of them the dam of Messenger, have been treated as spurious\r\nand wholly omitted from the records. These are the facts relating to\r\nthese two fillies claimed originally to be by Turf, and there can be no\r\nmoral doubt that they were omitted or excluded because Mr. Weatherby\r\ndeemed them unsustained and probably spurious.\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of the facts and circumstances already adduced, going to\r\nshow that Messenger was not thoroughbred, we are now ready to consider\r\none of the strongest arguments that can be advanced in support of that\r\nconclusion. This argument is founded on the laws of nature and is not\r\ndependent upon the mere writing down of uncertain traditions. Messenger\r\npossessed and transmitted qualities that no thoroughbred horse has ever\r\ntransmitted, from the period when the breed of race horses was formed to\r\nthe present day. It is practically conceded on all hands that Messenger,\r\nby his own power and by his own right, founded a family of trotting\r\nhorses, and this fact will be fully demonstrated in coming chapters. It\r\nis equally plain and, with honest and intelligent people, it is accepted\r\nwith equal readiness, that no thoroughbred horse has ever done this. This\r\ndeclaration has been much controverted, but always in a general way and\r\nwithout specifying any particular thoroughbred horse that had succeeded\r\nin establishing a family of trotters. In the progress of a discussion of\r\nthis point with the late Charles J. Foster, a very clear and able writer,\r\nhe was directly challenged, in a manner that could not be dodged, to name\r\nthe thoroughbred horse outside of Messenger, that had accomplished this\r\nfeat. Greatly to my surprise, and I might say, gratification, he came\r\nback at me with _two of Messenger’s sons_—Hambletonian and Mambrino. Thus\r\nhe conceded the whole contention, for out of, literally, thousands he had\r\nto come back to two sons of Messenger.\r\n\r\nIn reply to an article in _Wallace’s Monthly_ for December, 1887, going\r\nto show that Messenger was not a thoroughbred horse, Mr. Joseph Cairn\r\nSimpson, of California, an able man and a lifelong advocate of more\r\nrunning blood in the trotter, wrote a review of the article in question.\r\nAfter admitting the full force of the demonstration that Messenger was\r\nnot a thoroughbred horse, there is one sentence to which Mr. Simpson\r\ncannot subscribe, and he quotes it as follows: “Complete and conclusive\r\nas these facts may be, there is still another fact equally complete and\r\nstill more convincing. Messenger possessed and transmitted qualities\r\nthat no thoroughbred horse, in the experience of man, ever possessed\r\nand transmitted.” This was a declaration of Messenger as a progenitor\r\nagainst the whole world of thoroughbreds, and Mr. Simpson felt that he\r\ncould not let it pass unchallenged, and after scratching about among\r\nthe thousands of thoroughbreds without finding anything, like poor Mr.\r\nFoster, he “acknowledges the corn,” and comes back with Mambrino, _the\r\nson of Messenger_, without, seemingly, once realizing that he was proving\r\nmy contention.\r\n\r\nThe theory that if any other English race horse had been in Messenger’s\r\nplace and bred upon the same mares and had his progeny developed as\r\nMessenger’s were developed, he would have produced the same results, has\r\nalways been very popular with the advocates of “more running blood in the\r\ntrotter.” No doubt there are still some honest, but not well-informed\r\npeople, who hold to this view merely because they have never heard of any\r\nother imported English horses that were contemporaneous with Messenger,\r\nand hence have concluded there were none. If Messenger had been all\r\nalone during the twenty years of his stud services, as this theory\r\nassumes, there might be some reason to doubt whether some other English\r\nrace horses might not have done just as well in establishing a line or\r\ntribe of trotters. But was he alone? From the close of the Revolutionary\r\nWar to the end of the last century was a period of great activity and\r\nenterprise in the way of importing running horses from Great Britain. The\r\nblood of Herod and English Eclipse was in the highest estimate, not only\r\nin the old but in the new world, and a great many distinguished horses\r\nwere brought over possessing those favorite strains. During that period\r\nracing was carried on with just as much spirit and _éclat_ on Long Island\r\nand the river counties of New York, New Jersey, and some of the eastern\r\ncounties of Pennsylvania as it was in Virginia and South Carolina. Horses\r\nof the most fashionable lineage were sought after and patronized, not by\r\na few great breeding establishments, but by the farmers generally, in all\r\nthe region here designated. The following list of imported English race\r\nhorses is made up of animals that were contemporaneous with Messenger,\r\ncovering the same mares and the offspring subjected to precisely the\r\nsame treatment and conditions. The list is limited to what may be called\r\nthe trotting latitudes, and embraces such animals only as were brought\r\ninto New Jersey, New York and Eastern Pennsylvania. We will not only\r\ngive their names, but the blood elements also, so that all can see that\r\nMessenger not only had competitors but competitors of the highest grade\r\nof running blood.\r\n\r\n  Admiral, by Florizel, son of King Herod.\r\n  Ancient Pistol, by Ancient Pistol, son of Snap.\r\n  Arrakooker, by Drone, son of King Herod.\r\n  Baronet, by Vertumnus, son of Eclipse.\r\n  Benjamin, by Ruler, son of Young Marske.\r\n  Creeper, by Tandem, son of Dainty Davy.\r\n  Deserter, by Lenox, son of Delpini, by Highflyer.\r\n  Dey of Algiers, Arabian.\r\n  Diomed (Tate’s), by Phenomenon, son of King Herod.\r\n  Driver, by Saltram, son of Eclipse.\r\n  Drone, by King Herod.\r\n  Dungannon (Young), by Dungannon.\r\n  Expedition, by Pegasus, son of Eclipse.\r\n  Express, by Postmaster, son of King Herod.\r\n  Exton, by Highflyer, son of King Herod.\r\n  Florizel, by Florizel, son of King Herod.\r\n  Grand Seignor, Arabian.\r\n  Highflyer (1782), by Highflyer.\r\n  Highflyer (1792), by Highflyer.\r\n  Highlander (Brown), by Paymaster.\r\n  Highlander (Gray), by Bordeaux.\r\n  Honest John, by Sir Peter Teazle.\r\n  Joseph, by Ormond, son of King Fergus.\r\n  King William, by King Herod.\r\n  King William, by Paymaster.\r\n  Light Infantry, by Eclipse.\r\n  Magnetic Needle, by Magnet.\r\n  Magnum Bonum, by Matchem.\r\n  Nimrod, by King Fergus.\r\n  North Star, by North Star, son of Matchem.\r\n  Paymaster, by Paymaster.\r\n  Prince Frederick, by Fortunio.\r\n  Punch, by King Herod.\r\n  Revenge, by Achilles.\r\n  Rodney, by Paymaster.\r\n  Royal George, by Jupiter, son of Eclipse.\r\n  Royalist, by Saltram.\r\n  Slender, by King Herod.\r\n  Sour Crout, by Highflyer.\r\n  Venetian, by Doge.\r\n  Yorkshire, by Jupiter, son of Eclipse.\r\n\r\nHere we have forty-one imported English stallions, contemporaneous with\r\nMessenger, occupying the same territory and covering the same mares that\r\nhe covered. With the exceptions of two or three they were all ranked\r\nas not only thoroughbred, but they possessed the most fashionable and\r\nsuccessful blood that England had then produced. A few of them were taken\r\nsouthward after a time, but the great body of them lived out their days\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nTo this great array of imported English running horses we might add\r\nhundreds of their sons, and yet not find one that claimed to be\r\nthoroughbred that ever became a trotting progenitor or founded a family\r\nof trotters. Mr. Foster and Mr. Simpson, by far the two ablest writers on\r\nthe wrong side of the question that this country has produced, with this\r\nlist of forty English stallions before them from which to select their\r\nproof that Messenger was not the only progenitor of trotters, were at\r\nlast compelled to take two of Messengers sons, as trotting progenitors,\r\nto prove that their sire was not a trotting progenitor. If the\r\nintellectual powers of these two gentlemen had enabled them to scratch\r\never so little beneath the glittering surface of the word “thoroughbred,”\r\nthey would have saved themselves from this humiliating exhibition of\r\nabsurdity.\r\n\r\nWhat was true of Messenger’s contemporaries is equally true of all the\r\nstrictly thoroughbred stallions that have lived on the earth from his\r\nday to the present. No one of them has ever founded a trotting family\r\nand no one of them has ever got a trotter out of a mare of his own kind.\r\nOut of the half-dozen instances on record where a thoroughbred horse has\r\ngot a trotter there is no one instance in which the dam did not have\r\na strong pacing or trotting inheritance. If we accept the known and\r\nrecorded experiences of the past seventy years, in the trotting world, we\r\nfind two great facts on every page of the record. First, Messenger left\r\na family of trotters; second, no other thoroughbred horse did that. It\r\nfollows, then, that if Messenger transmitted capacities different from\r\nthose transmitted by thoroughbred horses, he must have had a different\r\ninheritance from thoroughbred horses, and if different, then that\r\ninheritance could not have been thoroughbred. From the facts we have\r\ndeveloped in the history of his English ancestors; from the ten thousand\r\ndemonstrations of his American descendants, and from the great laws which\r\ngovern the transmission of special capacities, we are forced to the\r\nconclusion that Messenger was not a thoroughbred horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF MESSENGER.\r\n\r\n    Messenger’s racing in England—His breeder unknown—Popular\r\n    uncertainty about the circumstances and date of\r\n    his importation—The matter settled by his first\r\n    advertisement—Uncertainty as to his importer—Description of\r\n    Messenger by David W. Jones, of Long Island—Careful consensus\r\n    of descriptions by many who had seen Messenger—His great and\r\n    lasting popularity as a stock horse—Places and prices of his\r\n    services for twenty years—Death and burial.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessenger made his first appearance on the turf in October, 1783, then\r\nthree years old, and ran twice, successfully, that year. He continued\r\non the turf till November, 1785, winning eight races, losing six and\r\nreceiving forfeits in two. Most of his races were practically matches,\r\nand all were single dashes but one, in which he was beaten. Two of his\r\nwinnings were less than a mile, five at the distance of a mile and a\r\nquarter, and one at two miles. These distances are approximate. He was\r\nbeaten at two and a quarter miles, three, and three and a half miles. He\r\nnever appeared in any great racing event, but seemed to be managed with a\r\nspecial view to picking up small prizes at short distances. His owner and\r\nmanager, Mr. Bullock, was a very shrewd “professional” at Newmarket, he\r\nhad quite a number of horses in the same stable with Messenger and some\r\nof them seem to have been selected always to run for the more valuable\r\nprizes. Considering the short distances he was able to run and the\r\nunimportant character of the contests in which he was engaged, we must\r\nconclude that Messenger was a very ordinary race horse.\r\n\r\nIt is not known by whom Messenger was bred. In his first advertisement in\r\nthis country it is stated that he was bred by John Pratt, of Newmarket,\r\nbut in the fourth volume of Pick’s “Turf Register,” continued by Johnson,\r\nit is stated explicitly that he “was bred by and the property of Mr.\r\nBullock, of Newmarket.” Mr. John Pratt was a breeder as well as a racing\r\nman of some prominence, in his day, and the certificate of pedigree from\r\nhim and purporting to have been issued by him was probably a fraud, as\r\nhe died May 8, 1785. This was while Messenger was still on the turf,\r\nand owned and controlled by Mr. Bullock for two years previous to this,\r\nstill no mention is made of the fact, and Mr. Pratt is made to say that\r\nhe sold him to the Prince of Wales, while all the evidence, which must\r\nnecessarily be of a negative character, goes to show that the Prince of\r\nWales never owned him. Mr. Pratt was a Yorkshire man, of Askrigg, in the\r\nNorth Riding, and although he died at Newmarket we have no trace of any\r\nof the family from which the dam of Messenger was said to have descended\r\never being in his possession. Besides this, it is not likely that the\r\nimporter of Messenger got a certificate from him two years after his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe different representations that have been made about Messenger’s\r\nimportation would fill a much larger space than would be profitable.\r\nAbout no horse has there been so much written, and about no horse\r\nhas there been so little really known. His character and memory have\r\nnever suffered defamation, for every writer was a eulogist of the\r\nmost enthusiastic type, whether he knew anything of his hero or not.\r\nAs a specimen of the admiration which he excited, it has been told a\r\nhundred times that when the horse came cavorting down the gangplank\r\nfrom the ship, with a groom hanging on to each side of his head,\r\nliterally carrying them for some distance before he could be checked,\r\nan enthusiastic horseman shouted out, “There, in that horse a million\r\ndollars strikes American soil.” This story has been told so often, even\r\nin England, that no doubt many people believe the startling prophecy\r\nwas really uttered. Indeed we have heard the name of the prophet, but\r\nas he was a distinguished New Yorker and as debarkation took place at\r\nPhiladelphia, we never have been able to fully reconcile the actor with\r\nthe occasion. The reputed prophecy, like the reputed pedigree, seems\r\nto have been an afterthought, but unlike the pedigree it proved true,\r\nwhether uttered or not. Some said he was imported 1785, while others\r\ndribble along through the intermediate years till 1800 was fixed upon\r\nwith great positiveness as the precise year. One of these gentlemen, we\r\nremember very well, was entirely confident he returned to England and\r\nwas brought back again after a number of years. Less than twenty years\r\nago the breeding world was favored with scores upon scores of this kind\r\nof teachers, not one of whom knew what he was talking about. The most\r\nsurprising example of this kind of writing, however, is furnished by Mr.\r\nC. W. Van Ranst, himself, who was part owner of the horse a number of\r\nyears. In a communication published in Skinner’s “Turf Register,” 1831,\r\nhe says Messenger was imported into New York in 1792, and in the same\r\npublication for 1834 he says he was imported into New York 1791. As the\r\nsequel will show, Mr. Van Ranst, although his owner, had no definite\r\nknowledge of the early history of the horse.\r\n\r\nFrom some slight investigations I became satisfied, years before, that\r\nMessenger made his first appearance in this country at Philadelphia, and\r\nthat he was imported into that city instead of New York. In that view all\r\nthe writers of the whole country were opposed to me; but, as it became\r\nmore and more evident that those writers were merely copying from one\r\nanother and that none of them had ever made an honest search for the\r\ntruth, I resolved to follow my own convictions and to commence there an\r\ninvestigation that would settle the matter one way or the other. In a few\r\nhours after reaching that city I found a file of the old _Pennsylvania\r\nPacket_, and in the number dated May 27, 1788, an advertisement of which\r\nthe following is a true copy:\r\n\r\n    JUST IMPORTED\r\n\r\n    The capital, strong, full blooded, English stallion,\r\n\r\n    MESSENGER.\r\n\r\n    To cover mares this season at Alexander Clay’s, at the sign of\r\n    the Black Horse, in Market Street, Philadelphia, at the very\r\n    low price of three guineas each mare, and one dollar to the\r\n    groom.\r\n\r\n    Messenger was bred by John Pratt, Esq., of Newmarket, who\r\n    certifies the following pedigree. The grey horse Messenger\r\n    was bred by me and sold to the Prince of Wales; he was got by\r\n    Mambrino (who covered at twenty-five guineas a leap). His dam\r\n    by Turf, his grandam by Regulus; this Regulus mare was sister\r\n    to Figerant and was the dam of Leviathan. JOHN PRATT.\r\n\r\nThe performance of Messenger has been so very great that there need only\r\nbe a reference to the racing calendar of the years 1783, 1784 and 1785.\r\n\r\nAny mare missing this season shall be served the next gratis, provided\r\nthey continue the same properties, on paying the groom’s fees.\r\n\r\nThis is a literal copy of the first printed announcement of Messenger in\r\nthis country, and there are two very striking features connected with\r\nit, namely, its bad grammar and the absence of the name of the importer\r\nand owner. The former we may attribute to the times, but to the latter\r\nI have been disposed to attach no trifling significance. It is a fact\r\nthat till this day we have no direct information as to who imported this\r\nhorse. The name “Benger” was developed indirectly as the man, but not\r\ntill years after the horse was dead, and probably the importer too, did I\r\nlearn from an advertisement of a son of his that stood in Jersey that the\r\nimporter’s name was “Thomas Benger.” In 1791 and for two years afterward\r\nhe was advertised to stand at “Mount Benger, two miles from Bristol,\r\nPennsylvania.” When I visited Bristol for the purpose of identifying\r\n“Mount Benger,” which I supposed was the country seat of the owner of\r\nMessenger, I was greatly surprised to find that none of the “oldest\r\ninhabitants” had ever heard of such a place, and when I was informed\r\nthat there was no locality within half a dozen miles of Bristol where\r\nthe ground rose to a hundred feet above the level of the Delaware River,\r\nthe name “Mount Benger” assumed the character of an absurdity as well\r\nas a myth. From a very intelligent man of middle age, who had learned\r\nthe blacksmith trade with his grandfather, I learned that he had often\r\nheard his grandfather speak of Messenger, and as having put the last set\r\nof shoes on him when he was taken away to New York the fall the yellow\r\nfever was so bad in Philadelphia. The tradition was still preserved in\r\nthe family that Messenger reared up in crossing the river in a boat, and\r\nstruck his groom on the head with one of those shoes, from the effects\r\nof which he died. As our informant was able to name two other horses,\r\nGovernor and Babel, brought over by Mr. Benger, we were ready to accept\r\nhis tradition that he lived at a point known in old times as “China\r\nRetreat,” two miles below Bristol on the Delaware. This point has been\r\nknown later as “White Hall.”\r\n\r\nAfter all traditions were exhausted, without yielding anything tangible\r\nor satisfactory, we turned with great confidence to the records of the\r\ncounty of Bucks, in which Mr. “Benger” had lived for a number of years.\r\nAfter a diligent and protracted search, embracing a number of years\r\nbefore and after his known residence in the county, we were not able to\r\ndiscover that any person by the name of “Benger” had ever owned a foot of\r\nreal estate in the county or had been in any way publicly connected with\r\nits affairs or its administration. We had search made in Philadelphia\r\nwith the same fruitless results. There is a faint tradition that Thomas\r\nBenger, if that was his name, was a fox-hunting Irish baronet, and if\r\nthis was so, it is probable he returned to the old country about the time\r\nhe sold Messenger in 1793. However this may be, the owner is forgotten,\r\nbut his horse will live forever.\r\n\r\nAmong the many eulogies and word-paintings of Messenger, by writers\r\nwho knew the horse personally, we select the following from the pen\r\nof the late David W. Jones, of Long Island, as the most striking and\r\npicturesque. He says:\r\n\r\n    “Having scanned in my boyhood the magnificent form and bearing\r\n    of this noble old horse, and for more than half a century\r\n    having drawn reins over his descendants, I have for a length of\r\n    time felt it incumbent to furnish such facts and impressions,\r\n    as, when considered with those of others, will give the younger\r\n    portion of the present generation, as well as posterity, a\r\n    fair knowledge of the general characteristics of the noblest\r\n    Roman of them all. The first time I ever saw old Messenger\r\n    my father sent me to the farm of Townsend Cock, Esq., of the\r\n    County of Queens, L. I., where the horse was then standing,\r\n    to receive his services. On my arrival at his harem, I found\r\n    the groom, whom I knew, and he at once placed me with the mare\r\n    a short distance from the stable, by the side of a barrier\r\n    erected for security. Having at home heard frequent and long\r\n    discussions in relation to the wonder I was now to behold, you\r\n    may suppose I was all eyes. Presently the stalwart groom, James\r\n    Lingham, with, at the extreme end of the bridle rein, all the\r\n    blood of all the Howards, turned the angle of the stable and\r\n    came in full view. The moment the old horse caught sight of\r\n    the paragon of beauty I had brought to his embrace, he threw\r\n    himself into an attitude, with the grandeur of which no other\r\n    animal can compare, and at the same moment opened his mouth,\r\n    and distending his nostrils, raised his exultant voice to such\r\n    a pitch as gave unmistakable evidence of the capacity of his\r\n    lungs and the size of his windpipe. Indeed, if his nostrils\r\n    were as much larger than ordinary as my boyish vision pictured\r\n    them, I can almost suppose that Mr. McMann with his little bay\r\n    mare (Flora Temple), and sulky, could drive in at one, down the\r\n    windpipe, turn under his immensely long arching loin and out at\r\n    the other.... At that early day I was only impressed by those\r\n    extraordinary developments; but in after years as I sit behind\r\n    his offspring, they invariably remind me of what was then to\r\n    my youthful judgment less apparent—the extraordinary strength\r\n    of his loin, the length and beautiful molding of the buttock,\r\n    the faultless shape of the crupper bone, giving an elegant set\r\n    to his fine flowing tail, as well as the remarkable swell of\r\n    his stifle, altogether forming a most perfect and powerful hind\r\n    quarter.”\r\n\r\nA good many years ago I made a special study of all that had been written\r\nabout Messenger, and I was fortunate in being able to supplement this\r\ninformation by interviews with a few old gentlemen who knew the horse\r\npersonally. Nearly all that generation of horsemen had passed away before\r\nI commenced this personal search for them. But a few then remained with\r\nexcellent memories and with characters above suspicion or reproach. From\r\nthese sources I gathered a great many incidents, facts and descriptions\r\nwhich I succeeded in harmonizing, to my own mind at least, and thus was\r\nable, to compile a complete description of the horse at every point. That\r\ndescription was written out more than twenty years ago, and in presenting\r\nit now I will not change a single word. At the time it was written,\r\nas will be seen from its perusal, I had really no doubt the horse was\r\nthoroughbred. It will not be charged, therefore, that the coarse traits\r\nbrought out in the description were influenced in any degree by a theory\r\nof his breeding:\r\n\r\n“Messenger was a grey, that became lighter and flea-bitten with age.\r\nHe was fifteen hands three inches high, and for a thoroughbred his\r\nappearance was coarse. He did not supply the mind with an idea of beauty,\r\nbut he impressed upon it a conception of solidity and power. His head was\r\nlarge and bony, with a nose that had a decided Roman tendency, though\r\nnot to a marked degree. His nostrils were unusually large and flexible,\r\nand when distended they were enormous. His eye was large, full, very\r\ndark and remarkably brilliant. In this particular he does not appear to\r\nhave inherited the weakness of his great-grandsire, Sampson. His ear was\r\nlarger than usual in the blood horse, but thin and tapering and always\r\nactive and expressive. The windpipe was so unusually large and stood\r\nout so much as a distinct feature that it marred what otherwise would\r\nhave been a gamelike throat-latch and setting on of the head. His neck\r\nwas very short for a blood horse, but was not coarse and thick like a\r\nbull’s; neither did it rise into such an enormous crest as that of his\r\nsire. It was not a bad neck in any sense, but like Lexington’s of our\r\nown day, it was too short to be handsome. His mane and foretop were thin\r\nand light. His withers were low and round, which appears to have been\r\na family characteristic in the male line, back for three generations\r\nat least. His shoulders were heavy and altogether too upright for our\r\nideas of a race horse. His barrel was perfection itself, both for depth\r\nand rotundity. His loin was well arched, broad and strong. His hips and\r\nquarters were ‘incomparably superior to all others.’ The column of the\r\nvertebra being of unusual depth and strength, gave the setting on of the\r\ntail a distinctive, but elegant character. The tail was carried in fine\r\nstyle; like the mane, it was not in superabundant quantity, but there was\r\nno such scantiness as to detract from the beauty and grace of the animal.\r\nHis stifles were well spread and swelling, but there appears to have been\r\nno unusual development at this point. From the stifle to the hock and\r\nfrom the elbow to the knee, no writer that we can now recall has given us\r\nany description of either length or strength. We may, therefore, take it\r\nfor granted that these points had no unusual development of muscle, but\r\nwere in harmony with the general contour and make-up of a great strong\r\nhorse. His hocks and knees were unusually large and bony, with all the\r\nmembers strong and clearly defined. The cannon bones were short and flat\r\nand the ligaments back of them were very large and braced a good way off,\r\nso that the leg was broad and flat. Mr. Jones says this part of the limb\r\nwas of medium size, but other writers all agree that he had an unusual\r\namount of bone at this point. Considering the whole style and character\r\nof the horse, and especially the character of his ancestors in the male\r\nline, and of Turf, the [reputed] sire of his dam, all of whom were\r\ndistinguished for their quantity of bone, we are disposed to think Mr.\r\nJones’ memory has not served him with entire accuracy in this particular.\r\nThe conviction is reasonable and grows out of evidence that comes from\r\nevery quarter, and we have no disposition to surrender it, that the bones\r\nof Messenger’s limbs were unusually large and strong for those of a\r\nthoroughbred. His pasterns and feet were all that could be desired, and\r\nas an evidence of the excellence and health of his underpinning several\r\nwriters have put it on record that whether in the stable or on the show\r\nground he never was known to mopingly rest one leg by standing on the\r\nother three, but was always prompt and upright. This is our conception\r\nof the form and appearance of the horse as we have reached it after a\r\ndiligent and careful study of all that has been said by those who saw him\r\nwhile he lived. From this description it is a very easy matter to pick\r\nout the features which gave him his coarse and badly bred appearance.\r\nHis big head, long ears, short neck, low withers, upright shoulders,\r\nlarge bones and, possibly, coarse hair, complete the catalogue. From\r\nthese features the purity of his blood has been doubted and denounced,\r\njust as that of his sire, his grandsire and his great-grandsire had\r\nbeen denounced. The coarseness, the cart-horse appearance was in the\r\nfamily, but it did not seem to prevent some of them from beating some\r\nof the best that England produced in successive generations. There are\r\nmany traditions that have been handed down to us concerning his temper,\r\nsome of which, no doubt, have accumulated and gathered strength and\r\nferocity in the years through which they have rolled. There have been\r\nperhaps half a dozen stories about his killing his keepers, but we\r\nare not able to say whether any one of them is true. It is known with\r\ncertainty, however, that he was willful and vicious and would tolerate no\r\nfamiliarity from strangers.”\r\n\r\nThe ownership of Messenger, after he was transferred from Philadelphia\r\nto New York, like his earlier history, seems to be very much muddled.\r\nHenry Astor, a New York butcher, certainly bought him in the fall of\r\n1793, and located him at Philip Platt’s, four miles from Jamaica, on\r\nLong Island. In the spring of 1796 Mr. Cornelius W. Van Ranst bought\r\none-third interest in him and removed him to Pine Plains in Dutchess\r\nCounty, New York, and, without specifying the time, he says he afterward\r\npurchased the remaining two-thirds, for which he paid two thousand seven\r\nhundred and fifty dollars. There appears to have been some mistake about\r\nthis, for in 1802 we find Henry Astor, of New York, conveying one-third\r\ninterest in the horse to Benjamin B. Cooper, of Camden, New Jersey. Some\r\nother parties also claim to have owned an interest in the horse, and I\r\nheard that there was a lawsuit about him between Astor and Van Ranst.\r\nThe latter claims to have owned an interest in him till the time of his\r\ndeath, in 1808. It is not known how much Mr. Astor paid for him when he\r\nbought him, nor have I any data from which to determine the probable\r\nmarket value of the horse except that Mr. Van Ranst says he paid two\r\nthousand seven hundred and fifty dollars for two-thirds of him. If we\r\naccept this as a basis, he must have been valued at about four thousand\r\none hundred and twenty-five dollars. It is true, beyond doubt, that\r\nfor several years he brought to his owners a net annual rental of one\r\nthousand dollars. This would indicate a very large patronage at very high\r\nprices for those times. For the twenty years of his stud services in this\r\ncountry, we find him located as follows:\r\n\r\n1788, at Alexander Clay’s, Market Street, Philadelphia, at $15 the season\r\nand $1 to the groom, privilege of returning.\r\n\r\n1789, at Thomas Clayton’s, Lombard Street, Philadelphia, at $10 the\r\nseason and $1 to the groom.\r\n\r\n1790, at Noah Hunt’s, in the Jersies, near Pennington, at $8.\r\n\r\n1791, at “Mount Benger,” two miles from Bristol, Bucks Co., Pa., at $16.\r\n\r\n1792, at the same place and the same price.\r\n\r\n1793, at the same place and the same price.\r\n\r\n1794, at Philip Platt’s, fifteen miles from New York and four from\r\nJamaica, Long Island, at $25 the season.\r\n\r\n1795, at the same place and the same price, when, as Mr. Van Ranst\r\nexpressed it, “he took with our horsemen.”\r\n\r\n1796, at Pine Plains, Dutchess County, N. Y., where he covered 106 mares\r\nat $30 the season.\r\n\r\n1797, I have no advertisement for this year, but it is probable he was at\r\nthe same place at the same price.\r\n\r\n1798, at Pine Plains, as before, and the terms $30 for the season and $40\r\nto insure.\r\n\r\n1799, I have no definite trace of him this year, but there are some\r\nindications he was in West Jersey.\r\n\r\n1800, for the spring season he is not located, but he made a fall season\r\nat John Stevens’ in Maidenhead, Hunterdon Co., N. J.\r\n\r\n1801, at Goshen, Orange Co., N. Y., and I have seen the book account of\r\nexpenses, etc., while he was there.\r\n\r\n1802, at Cooper’s Ferry, opposite Philadelphia, Pa., but the price of\r\nservices is not mentioned.\r\n\r\n1803, at Townsend Cock’s, near Oyster Bay, Long Island, at $20 the season.\r\n\r\n1804, at the same place and the same price.\r\n\r\n1805, at Bishop Underhill’s, in Westchester Co., N. Y., fifteen miles\r\nfrom Harlem Bridge. Price reduced to $15.\r\n\r\n1806, back again at Townsend Cock’s, and the terms fixed at $15 for the\r\nseason, and $25 to insure.\r\n\r\n1807, again at Bishop Underhill’s on the same terms as before, and this\r\nwas the last of his twenty years’ stud services. It will be observed\r\nthat the horse is located every year except two, and these locations\r\nare determined, not by tradition or hearsay, but by copies of his\r\nadvertisements for each year. In giving the prices charged for his\r\nservices I have given the value of the guinea or the pound as five\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nMessenger died January 28, 1808, in the stable of Townsend Cock, on Long\r\nIsland, in his twenty-eighth year. This date has been as familiar to all\r\nintelligent horsemen for the last forty years as any prominent event in\r\nthe history of the nation. The news of the death of the old patriarch\r\nspread with great rapidity, and soon the whole countryside was gathered\r\nto see the last of the king of horses and to assist at his burial. His\r\ngrave was prepared at the foot of a chestnut-tree some distance in front\r\nof the house, and there he was deposited in his holiday clothing. In\r\nresponse to the consciousness that a hero was there laid away forever\r\na military organization was extemporized, and volley after volley by\r\nplatoons was fired over his grave. Some of the young men and boys who\r\nwitnessed and participated in the ceremonies of the occasion were still\r\nliving twenty years ago, and as they related the incidents of the\r\noccasion to me, their recollections seemed to be as clear and bright as\r\nthough the occurrence had been of yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER’S SONS.\r\n\r\n    Hambletonian (Bishop’s) pedigree not beyond doubt—Cadwallader\r\n    R. Colden’s review of it—Ran successfully—Taken to Granville,\r\n    N. Y.—Some of his descendants—Mambrino, large and coarse\r\n    in appearance—Failure as a runner—Good natural trotter—His\r\n    most famous sons were Abdallah, Almack and Mambrino\r\n    Paymaster—Winthrop or Maine Messenger and his pedigree and\r\n    history—Engineer and the tricks of his owners—Certainly\r\n    a son of Messenger—Commander—Bush Messenger, pedigree\r\n    and description—Noted as the sire of coach horses and\r\n    trotters—Potomac—Tippoo Saib—Sir Solomon—Ogden Messenger, dam\r\n    thoroughbred—Mambrino (Grey)—Black Messenger—Whynot, Saratoga,\r\n    Nestor, Delight—Mount Holly, Plato, Dover Messenger, Coriander,\r\n    Fagdown, Bright Phœbus, Slasher, Shaftsbury, Hotspur,\r\n    Hutchinson Messenger and Cooper’s Messenger—Abuse of the name\r\n    “Messenger.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to write a history of all the descendants of\r\nMessenger, for that would fill several volumes and would be simply\r\nwriting over again the trotting and pacing records of the past twenty\r\nyears. I will, therefore, limit the chapters on this topic to such of\r\nhis descendants as have demonstrated the value and prominence of their\r\nblood, as a factor, in the make-up of the American Trotter. Naturally,\r\nthe immediate progeny of Messenger will first demand consideration, and\r\nthen will follow the succeeding generations that have written their own\r\nhistory in the official records of trotting and pacing. Completeness\r\nof description and space occupied will be determined, chiefly, by the\r\nprominence and historic value of the animal under review. In this scope\r\nand without following any chronological order, I will try to embrace all\r\nthat is known that would be of value to the student of trotting-horse\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nHAMBLETONIAN (BISHOP’S), originally called HAMILTONIAN.—This was a\r\ndark-bay horse about fifteen hands two inches high. He was bred by\r\nGeneral Nathaniel Coles, of Dosoris, Long Island, and was foaled 1804.\r\nHe was got by Messenger, his dam Pheasant (the Virginia Mare), said\r\nto be thoroughbred, by imp. Shark and grandam by imp. Medley. I first\r\nunearthed the pedigree of this “Virginia Mare” in the advertisement of\r\nHambletonian for 1814 when he was owned by Townsend Cock and standing\r\nthat year at Goshen, New York. The “Old Turfman,” Cadwallader R. Colden,\r\nwas thoroughly familiar with all turf subjects in the early years of\r\nthis century, and was the best turf writer of his generation. He had no\r\npatience or tolerance with frauds in pedigrees and always exposed them\r\nwithout mercy. He stoutly maintains that the pedigree of the “Virginia\r\nMare” was bogus, and, to use his own language, he says:\r\n\r\n    “When Hambletonian became a public stallion, his owners were\r\n    in a dilemma; a _pedigree_ was necessary, so to work they\r\n    went, and, as many had done before and as many are doing now,\r\n    _made one_; and in his handbills his dam was given as bred in\r\n    Virginia, and got by imported Shark, with a train of maternal\r\n    ancestors, with as much truth, and affording as much ability to\r\n    trace it or discover the breeder of the dam, as though they had\r\n    said _hi, cockalorum jig_.”\r\n\r\nMr. Colden goes into the pedigree of this mare and the non-racing\r\ncharacter of her family at great length, and it cannot be denied that\r\nhe has the whole argument. As a specimen of sharp and interesting turf\r\nwriting of that period and from that pen, I must commend my readers to\r\nturn to this article, which will be found in _Wallace’s Monthly_, Vol.\r\nII., p. 67.\r\n\r\nWith the probabilities all against the truthfulness of the pedigree of\r\nthe dam, as given, it is certainly true that he was a running horse and\r\nattained distinction in his day. I have no full list of his performances\r\nat hand, but the following may be taken as a fair summary of his\r\nprincipal achievements. He ran at Newmarket in the spring of 1807 (then\r\nthree years old), one mile, beating General Coles’ colt Bright Phœbus,\r\nMr. Terhune’s bay filly, and distancing two others. He also ran, two days\r\nafter the above race, four heats of a mile each, beating Bright Phœbus\r\nagain and distancing three others. In the fall of 1808 he ran five weeks\r\nsuccessively, and the three last weeks he won three four-mile purses,\r\nrunning the distance in shorter time than it ever had been run in the\r\nState of New York. I must say here that these races were run on the then\r\nHarlem course, which was not a full mile in length.\r\n\r\nWhile Hambletonian was on the turf, Tippoo Sultan, a grandson of\r\nMessenger, beat Bond’s First Consul in a famous four-mile race, and Mr.\r\nBond determined that he would find a horse that would be able to lower\r\nTippoo Sultan’s colors, and it was thought there was nothing in the\r\nNorth able to do it except Miller’s Damsel, so he made a match for four\r\nthousand dollars a side on condition that Damsel should prove not to be\r\nin foal. But the mare proving to be in foal the match was off. He then\r\ntook Hambletonian into his stable and offered to match him for the same\r\namount against Tippoo Sultan, but he went amiss and the match was off.\r\nThis incident is here introduced to show that whatever his real merits,\r\nHambletonian had some reputation as a running horse. It was said that\r\nthe secret of Mr. Colden’s hostility to the “Virginia Mare” and her\r\ndescendants was because those descendants were always able to beat the\r\ndescendants of his fashionably bred mare Matilda. Whatever the motive in\r\nexposing a pedigree that has never been fully established, there is one\r\nparticular and that the most important of all particulars, in which Mr.\r\nColden has done justice to Hambletonian. He says: “_Hambletonian got some\r\nexcellent roadsters, good trotters._”\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no description of this horse extant that is fully\r\nsatisfactory. For some seasons he was in the hands of Mr. Daniel T.\r\nCock, who in 1869 furnished me the following: “He was a dark bay, a\r\nlittle heavy about the head and neck, fifteen and a half hands high, and\r\nrather an upright shoulder. Back, loin and hind quarters as good as were\r\never put on a horse. Fore legs a little light, but hind legs strong and\r\ngood—pretty straight. He was a beautiful saddle horse, notwithstanding\r\nhis head and ear were a little coarse.” Other persons who had seen him\r\nhave described him as “a great strong horse, with bone and substance\r\nenough to pull the plow or do any other kind of drudgery.” It has been\r\nsaid that he had a fine open trotting gait and that, in a cutter with old\r\nIsaac Bishop behind him, he was able to show the boys the road.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 he became the property of Townsend Cock, of Long Island, and he\r\nremained on the turf till 1810, when he was put in the stud. That and the\r\nfollowing season he was at the stable of his owner; 1812 at Cornwall;\r\n1813 at Fishkill; 1814 at Goshen; 1815-16 at Fishkill; 1817 at White\r\nPlains. In the winter of 1819 Mr. Cock sold him to Stephen and Smith\r\nGermond of Dutchess County, New York, and Isaac Bishop of Granville, New\r\nYork. The latter was probably the real owner, and the horse then became\r\nknown as “Bishop’s Hambletonian.” He made several seasons in the region\r\nof Granville and was back in Dutchess County 1823 and 1824. The next year\r\nhe was at Granville—1825. He made one season, at least, at Burlington,\r\nVermont, and some seasons or parts of seasons at Poultney, Vermont. It is\r\nsaid he lived till 1834.\r\n\r\nAt Wallingford, Vermont, he was bred upon the “Munson Mare,” said to be\r\na daughter of imported Messenger, and doubtless either by him or one\r\nof his earlier sons, and the produce was Harris’ Hambletonian, also\r\nknown as “The Remington Horse” and Bristol Grey, and this son became\r\nthe progenitor of a great tribe of trotters, known as the “Vermont\r\nHambletonians,” some of which were very fast pacers, among them the\r\nfamous Hero, the fastest of his generation. Another son of Mr. Bishop’s\r\nhorse was the Judson Hambletonian, that was the sire of the Andrus horse,\r\nthat got the famous Princess, that was pitted against Flora Temple. He\r\nwas also bred on his half-sister, Silvertail, by Messenger, and produced\r\nOne Eye, a very fast mare, the grandam of Rysdyk’s Hambletonian, and\r\nI have always thought that this combination was the very cream of the\r\npedigree of that great horse. He was also bred on a daughter of Mr.\r\nCoffin’s son of Messenger and produced Whalebone, that was the phenomenal\r\nlong-distance trotter of his generation. His son, Sir Peter, out of an\r\nunknown mare, was also a famous old-time trotter. One of his daughters\r\nwas bred to Coriander, son of Messenger, and the produce was Topgallant,\r\nthe fastest horse of his time. These individual enumerations might be\r\nextended indefinitely, but I have given enough to show that he was not\r\nmerely a progenitor of trotting speed in remote generations, but that\r\nspeed came directly from his own loins. Another most significant fact is\r\nhere brought to light, namely, that when bred back upon the blood of his\r\nown sire he achieved his greatest successes.\r\n\r\nMAMBRINO.—This great son of Messenger was a bright bay with a star and\r\none white ankle. He was fully sixteen hands high, with great length of\r\nbody and generally of coarse appearance. He was foaled 1806, and was\r\nbred by Mr. Lewis Morris, of Westchester County, New York. His dam was\r\nby imported Sour Grout, out of a mare by imported Whirligig, and she out\r\nof the famous Miss Slammerkin, that is a well-known landmark reaching\r\nbeyond the Revolution. The late William T. Porter, of the _Spirit of the\r\nTimes_, stoutly maintained that Mambrino was not a thoroughbred horse,\r\nand his reasons seemed to rest wholly upon his coarse and cart-horse\r\nappearance. Technically, Mr. Porter was right, but the trouble did not\r\nrest with the dam, as he seems to have supposed, for I have seen the\r\noriginal certificate of breeding in the handwriting of Mr. Morris, his\r\nbreeder, and there is no slip on that side of the pedigree. Mr. Morris\r\nwas a prominent breeder and racing man for many years and his character\r\nwas without taint. The pedigree is a very long one and I would be very\r\nfar from vouching for the truth of the remote extensions, but back to the\r\nmare by Cub, imported by Mr. De Lancey, who bred Miss Slammerkin, there\r\ncan be no mistake.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1810, then four years old, he was purchased of his\r\nbreeder by Major William Jones, of Queens County, Long Island, and in the\r\nautumn of that year he was trained and ran for the two-mile purse at the\r\nold Newmarket Course, Long Island, and it is said gave some evidence that\r\nhe could run, but after that he was never trained nor started in a race,\r\nfrom which we may conclude he was not a race horse, or his owner, who\r\nbred and ran his horses, would have given him another trial.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 he was put in the stud and made the season at Huntington, Long\r\nIsland, in charge of Ebenezer Gould. It is not known where he made the\r\nseason of 1812, but probably in Orange or Dutchess County. The years\r\n1813-14-15 he was in charge of my late highly esteemed and venerable\r\ncorrespondent, David W. Jones, on the borders of Queens and Suffolk\r\ncounties, Long Island, where he covered about two hundred and fifty\r\nmares. In 1816 he was in one of the river counties, in 1817 at Fishkill,\r\nand 1818 at Townsend Cock’s, Long Island. In later years he changed hands\r\nmany times, at from two hundred to two hundred and fifty dollars, and\r\nthere is no published trace of him till we find that he made the seasons\r\nof 1825 and 1829 at Pleasant Valley, Dutchess County, and he died the\r\nproperty of Benjamin Germond, on the farm of Azariah Arnold in Dutchess\r\nCounty, about 1831.\r\n\r\nHe took his beautiful color from his dam and transmitted it with great\r\nuniformity. His general structure was after the Messenger model,\r\nespecially in the large bones and joints of his limbs. His head was\r\nlong and bony and his ears were large and somewhat heavy. He was too\r\nhigh on his legs and his general appearance was coarse, all of which he\r\ntransmitted. In speaking of his offspring Mr. Jones remarks: “When young\r\nthey were somewhat leggy and lathy, but spirited, stylish and slashing\r\nin action. When matured, he must indeed be fastidious who would crave\r\nanother.” With regard to his gait Mr. Jones uses the following very\r\nemphatic language: “I have been the breeder of some, and the owner of\r\nmany good horses, and with the best opportunities of judging, having\r\nridden him (he was never driven) many, many miles, I say, with entire\r\nconfidence, he was the best natural trotter I ever threw a leg over. His\r\nwalk was free, flinging and elastic; his trot clear, square and distinct,\r\nwith a beautiful roll of the knee and great reach of the hind leg.” In\r\nthe absence of actual training and timing, it is hardly possible to get\r\nbetter evidence that Mambrino was a natural trotter that might have been\r\ndeveloped to a considerable rate of speed. It would be interesting to\r\nknow just why the horse “never was driven.” Did he show an unconquerable\r\naversion to harness, and did Abdallah inherit this aversion? This\r\ndescription of Mambrino’s gait was written in 1866, and the writer had\r\nspent a long lifetime in an intimate personal knowledge of many, or\r\nindeed most, of the best early trotters that this country had produced.\r\n\r\nThe only one of his immediate progeny that attained distinction as a\r\ntrotter was the famous Betsey Baker. This mare was very prominent among\r\nthe best of her day, and was able, on one occasion at least, to beat\r\nthe great Topgallant, and in tandem with Grey Harry when she was old\r\nshe trotted in 2:41¾-2:43¾. Others of his progeny were trotters of some\r\nmerit, but none of them especially distinguished on the turf. His three\r\nsons, Abdallah, Almack and Mambrino Paymaster, are the bright links in\r\nthe chain extending from Messenger to the two-minute trotter that will\r\nkeep his memory green as long as there is a trotting horse on the earth.\r\nAbdallah at the head of the Hambletonians, Almack at the head of the\r\nChampions, and Mambrino Paymaster at the head of the Mambrino Chiefs\r\nembrace the major portion of the great trotters of this generation.\r\n\r\nWINTHROP, OR MAINE MESSENGER.—Perhaps no son of Messenger, not excepting\r\nHambletonian and Mambrino, produced a more marked effect upon the stock\r\nof any part of the country than this horse did in the State of Maine.\r\nThe impress he there made was not only remarkable at the time, but it is\r\nstill felt and acknowledged in his descendants to this day. There have\r\nbeen many conflicting statements made to the public about him and his\r\nhistory, but I think I am now able to give, in authentic and reliable\r\nform, all that is really known of his origin and history. He was foaled\r\nabout 1807 and was among the last colts by the imported horse, but\r\nunfortunately we know nothing of the blood of his dam. Mr. Alvan Hayward,\r\nfor many years a citizen of Kennebec County, Maine, but more recently of\r\nYork, Livingston County, New York, says his dam possessed some imported\r\nblood; but as all his records and memoranda were burned up in 1845 he is\r\nnot able to give the pedigree of the mare that produced him.\r\n\r\nMr. Hayward bought the horse about 1817 or 1818, in the village of Paris,\r\nOneida County, New York, of a man by the name of Rice or Wright, but\r\ndid not remember which. He took him to Winthrop, Maine, where he was\r\nfirst known as “Messenger,” then as “Kennebec Messenger,” or “Winthrop\r\nMessenger,” and when he became old, as “Old Messenger.” The earliest\r\ncontemporaneous account I have of this horse is his advertisement for the\r\nseason of 1819, which I copy from the Hallowell _Gazette_ of May 12, of\r\nthat year, and is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “THE VALUABLE HORSE MESSENGER.\r\n\r\n    “The subscriber hereby recommends to the public and all who\r\n    feel interested to improve in the breed of good and serviceable\r\n    horses, the good horse Messenger, that stock so well known and\r\n    approved of on Long Island, New York, and Pennsylvania. Said\r\n    horse was raised on Long Island, and owned by Mr. Rylander, a\r\n    gentleman who has taken the greatest pains to import the best\r\n    breed of horses that came to his knowledge. Said horse is a\r\n    silver grey, well proportioned, of a large size, and a good\r\n    traveler. Gentlemen who are desirous of raising good horses\r\n    will do well to call and see for themselves.\r\n\r\n    “The Messenger will stand for the most part of the time in the\r\n    village at Withrop Mills.\r\n\r\n                                                     ALVAN HAYWARD.\r\n\r\n    “Winthrop, May 1st, 1819.”\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it will be seen that the new element, brought out in\r\nthe history of this horse is the statement that he was owned at one time\r\nby Mr. Rylander, of Long Island. There were two brothers of this name,\r\nand they imported a great many horses, but never before had I heard their\r\nnames connected with Winthrop Messenger. This carries us back to a period\r\nin the history of the horse before he was taken to Oneida County.\r\n\r\nColonel Stanley, a prominent banker of Augusta, and at one time a leading\r\nhorseman and stage proprietor, bought Messenger of his kinsman, Hayward,\r\nand owned him some seven years. He says the horse was brought to Maine as\r\nearly as 1816, and that his Uncle Hayward had certificates that he was\r\ngot by imported Messenger, out of a mare well-bred and part of imported\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nIn a communication from Mr. Sanford Howard, who had been prominently\r\nconnected with the breeding interests of the country for many years, the\r\nfollowing description is given:\r\n\r\n    “I saw him several times, first in 1828. In the latter years of\r\n    his life he stood mostly at Anson, on the Kennebec River, and I\r\n    think died there about 1831 [he died at Dixfield]. He appeared\r\n    like an old horse when I first saw him, older, perhaps, from\r\n    being much afflicted with grease, which had become chronic,\r\n    and at length had almost destroyed his hoofs; so that the last\r\n    time I saw him he was nearly incapable of locomotion. His\r\n    feet and legs looked like those of an elephant. This trouble\r\n    was transmitted to his offspring through several generations\r\n    (though not invariably so), and constituted, perhaps, in\r\n    connection with, in many cases, a flat foot and low heels,\r\n    their greatest defect.\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Hayward states, in concluding his letter, that he has no\r\n    doubt the horse he took to Maine was got by imp. Messenger.\r\n    The remark is probably elicited by intimations that he might\r\n    have been gotten by a son of Messenger. I presume Mr. Hayward’s\r\n    belief was well founded. As imported Messenger did not die\r\n    until the 28th of January, 1808, there is no discrepancy\r\n    between that event and the age of Mr. H.’s horse. At the same\r\n    time I must admit that Maine Messenger hardly looked like a\r\n    half-blood horse. He was pretty large, rather short-legged,\r\n    thick-set, with heavy mane and tail, very hairy legs, long\r\n    hair on his jaws, and was heavy coated (in winter) all over\r\n    his body. These characteristics were sometimes accounted for\r\n    by saying he was probably out of a Dutch mare, meaning such\r\n    mares as the Dutch farmers of New York kept. I never heard of\r\n    any claim being set up for his speed in trotting, and I presume\r\n    he was never tried at running. He was strong and plucky, and\r\n    the story was told at Winthrop that on an occasion when all\r\n    the stallions of the neighborhood were brought out to be\r\n    shown, they were put to a trot in sleighs for half a mile or\r\n    so, and Messenger was beaten. Whereupon his owner proposed\r\n    that the horses should each draw a sled with six men on it up\r\n    to Winthrop hill, and be timed. It was done, and Messenger\r\n    beat them all. I think the first of his offspring that became\r\n    noted for fast trotting was a gelding called Lion, taken to\r\n    Boston by a well-known horse dealer by the name of Hodges,\r\n    of Hallowell, Maine. He was sold, I think, for four hundred\r\n    dollars, which made quite a sensation among the Kennebec\r\n    farmers who had any stock of the same sort. I do not recollect\r\n    the rate of speed this horse showed, but a mile in three\r\n    minutes was then considered wonderful, and probably this was\r\n    about his rate. Other horses of the stock were soon brought\r\n    out as fast travelers. I remember a friend of mine showing me\r\n    some young horses he was training, and I rode with him after\r\n    several of them. They were _natural trotters_, and would do\r\n    _nothing but trot_, even under severe applications of the whip.\r\n    But I think the second generation from Mr. Hayward’s horse\r\n    were generally faster trotters than the first. They were also\r\n    generally handsomer horses, not so rough looking. Nearly all\r\n    the horses of this stock which have acquired a reputation in\r\n    Massachusetts, New York, etc., as fast trotters, had not more\r\n    than a quarter of the blood of the horse that Mr. Hayward took\r\n    to Maine, and consequently had not more than an eighth of the\r\n    blood of imported Messenger.\r\n\r\n    “The mares that produced these horses were of no particular\r\n    blood. Various stallions had been kept in that section. Morgans\r\n    from New Hampshire and Vermont, with an occasional change to\r\n    the French Canadians, and now and then a quarter or half bred\r\n    horse from New York or New Jersey.”\r\n\r\nThis excellent communication from Mr. Howard is especially valuable,\r\nas the conclusions drawn by an accurate and competent observer from a\r\npersonal acquaintance with the original horse and his progeny. There are\r\nsome inferences, however, that may be drawn from Mr. Howard’s letter\r\nthat would be unjust to this distinguished animal. His general coarse\r\nappearance, in connection with which Mr. H. says, “he hardly looked like\r\na half bred horse,” was a prominent feature in the family. Mambrino,\r\na very high-bred son of old Messenger, was very coarse, and the same\r\nremark was often made about him. The quantity and length of his coat in\r\nthe winter of his old age are not conclusive against his pretensions to\r\na large share of good and pure blood. They are the results oftentimes\r\nof neglect and ill health. It is somewhere stated that the famous Sir\r\nArchy before he died looked exceedingly shaggy, his hair being fully\r\nthree inches long. Mr. Howard expresses the opinion that “the second\r\ngeneration from Mr. Hayward’s horse were generally faster trotters than\r\nthe first.” In many instances this, no doubt, is true, for it would be\r\naltogether contrary to the uniform laws which govern these things if\r\ndevelopment and use did not strengthen and intensify the instinct to trot\r\nin successive generations. If Mr. Howard is right, and we do not doubt he\r\nis, the increased capacity did not grow out of the dilution of the blood,\r\nbut out of the strengthening of the instinct by culture and use. At the\r\ntime Mr. Howard made this remark he evidently did not know that the\r\nfamous old-time trotters, Daniel D. Tompkins and Fanny Pullen, were both\r\nimmediately from the loins of Winthrop Messenger. In their day these two\r\nwere classed among the best and fastest trotters that the world had then\r\nproduced. The facts that both these animals were the immediate progeny of\r\nWinthrop Messenger were never brought to light for many years, and all I\r\nwill say about them now is that they do not rest on shadowy traditions or\r\nsuppositions, but are fully and circumstantially established.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written by Mr. Hayward, May 12, 1852, in speaking of the\r\nuseful and everyday qualities of this horse’s progeny, he used the\r\nfollowing language:\r\n\r\n    “The stock produced by that horse I consider superior, as\r\n    combining more properties useful in a horse than any other\r\n    stock I have ever been acquainted with, being good for draft,\r\n    for carriage, for travel, for parade, or any place where\r\n    horses are required. They had great bottom and strength, and\r\n    were of hardy constitution. There are some horses in this town\r\n    twenty-two years old, that were by a son of Winthrop Messenger,\r\n    which I brought with me when I left Maine. They have always\r\n    been accustomed to draw the plow and to perform other hard\r\n    labor, and yet they have the appearance of young horses, and\r\n    will now do more service than many horses of seven or eight\r\n    years old.”\r\n\r\nAmong the several sons of imported Messenger whose names are conspicuous\r\nas the progenitors of great tribes of the most distinguished trotters I\r\nknow of no one entitled to a higher place on the roll of fame, all things\r\nconsidered, than this one that went to Maine, and there laid a foundation\r\nthat has made the State famous throughout the length and breadth of the\r\nland for the speed and stoutness of its trotting horses.\r\n\r\nWith such noted performers from his own loins as Fanny Pullen and Daniel.\r\nD. Tompkins, and in the next generation the famous Zachary Taylor, this\r\nhorse made about the best showing of all the sons of Messenger, but as\r\nhis line failed to produce a Rysdyk’s Hambletonian or a Mambrino Chief,\r\nit dropped to a place somewhat removed from the front of the procession.\r\n\r\nENGINEER was a grey horse, about sixteen hands high and very elegant in\r\nhis form, style and proportions. The earliest account we have of him is\r\nin the spring of 1816, when he was advertised in _The Long Island Star_\r\nto stand at the stable of Daniel Seely, near Suffolk Court House, and\r\nat Jericho, in Queens County. He was in charge of Thomas Jackson, Jr.,\r\ngenerally designated as “Long Tom.” He was then well advanced in years,\r\nbut no attempt was made to give his age. Mr. Daniel T. Cock, in charge\r\nof Duroc and one or two other stallions, was then in sharp competition\r\nwith Engineer, and he assures me he was a horse of large size, great\r\nshare of bone and sinew, most elegant form, and a fine mover. His elegant\r\nappearance was so captivating that he was a very troublesome competitor.\r\n\r\nThe advertisement referred to contains the following very unsatisfactory\r\nparagraph relating to his pedigree, viz., “The manner he came into\r\nthis country is such that I cannot give an account of his pedigree,\r\nbut his courage and activity show the purity of his blood, which is\r\nmuch better than the empty sound of a long pedigree.” This was a most\r\nunexpected discovery, for I had always understood that Engineer was a\r\nson of Messenger and never had heard of this mystery before. It is here\r\nintimated that the horse was imported, and the story that Jackson told\r\nwas that he was brought from England to Canada by a British officer, and\r\nby some surreptitious means found his way from Canada to Long Island.\r\nWhat appears to be the real history of the horse, and the version\r\naccepted afterward by everybody on the island, will be found in the\r\nfollowing extract from a letter written by David W. Jones, February 28,\r\n1870. He says:\r\n\r\n    “I can well account for Mr. Cock’s recollections of the history\r\n    of the first Engineer. Thomas Jackson and George Tappan,\r\n    noted owners and keepers of stallions on Long Island and in\r\n    the counties of Orange and Dutchess, in the course of their\r\n    peregrinations met with a person in possession of this horse,\r\n    who offered him for sale. Impressed with his fine appearance\r\n    and pedigree, they at once entered into negotiations for\r\n    his purchase, and finally obtained him at so low a price as\r\n    to cause strong suspicions that he was not honestly in his\r\n    vendor’s possession. They, however, determined to take the\r\n    chances, and at once brought him to Long Island, their place\r\n    of residence, and determined on what they deemed a harmless\r\n    representation in regard to his history; for this they had\r\n    several motives. First, Messenger stallions were then very\r\n    numerous on Long Island; their blood coursed in the veins of\r\n    nearly every brood mare. Secondly, imported stallions were much\r\n    desired, and by a little added fiction they could give him\r\n    considerable _éclat_, and thirdly, in case of his having been\r\n    unjustly obtained this would afford the best means of disguise.\r\n    Accordingly they represented him as having been imported from\r\n    England to Canada and ridden in the army by Gen. Brock, who,\r\n    in an engagement with our troops, was shot and killed. The\r\n    horse, escaping into our lines, was secured by our soldiers and\r\n    brought to the State of New York. On these representations they\r\n    claimed to have purchased him. No pedigree, as I recollect,\r\n    was attempted to be given, and though many doubted the truth\r\n    of this statement, there was no evidence to controvert it.\r\n    For a length of time this story was adhered to; but after\r\n    several years, when all fears of difficulty had subsided,\r\n    they acknowledged the deception. Mr. Tappan, who resided but\r\n    a few miles from me, was a man of more than ordinary candor\r\n    and fairness, for one of his position and employment. I knew\r\n    him well, and occasionally rendered him a favor by preparing\r\n    his horse bills. On one of these occasions, at my house, he\r\n    gave a full and particular statement of the whole affair. Some\r\n    of the details have escaped me, but the essential facts are\r\n    distinctly recollected. The owner, with Engineer in possession,\r\n    was met at some public place and the purchase completed, and\r\n    this statement then made, ‘that he had become involved in debt,\r\n    and that his creditor had begun a prosecution, with a view\r\n    to levy on the horse, the only property he possessed, and he\r\n    was determined not to lose all.’ This was certainly enough to\r\n    arouse their suspicions with regard to his history. He declared\r\n    the horse was bred and raised in Pennsylvania and that he was\r\n    got by imported Messenger. Whether any further pedigree was\r\n    given is not recollected. He was at this time (1814) a horse\r\n    considerably advanced in years and perfectly white. Mr. Tappan\r\n    also told me that he had afterward traced the horse, and was\r\n    entirely satisfied of the former owner’s veracity. I will not\r\n    apologize for the length of this statement, being desirous of\r\n    giving you all the information here possessed and probably all\r\n    that can now be obtained.”\r\n\r\nI am not aware that in the past sixty years any question has ever been\r\nraised as to the truth of the universally accepted statement that\r\nEngineer was a true son of Messenger, and I would not have disturbed\r\nit now, nor thought of doing so, had it not been for that remarkable\r\nadvertisement discovered in the obscure Long Island paper. That was\r\ncontemporaneous history, however, and it must either be explained or\r\naccepted. The question has been examined down to the bottom by one of the\r\nmost conscientious and capable men of his generation, in this department\r\nof knowledge. His verdict has been accepted as the truth by all parties\r\nof that day, and I cannot reject it.\r\n\r\nIt is not known that any of his immediate progeny attained distinction\r\non the trotting turf. Several of his sons bore his name in the stud and\r\nwhile their blood seemed to be helpful in the right direction, only one\r\nof them made any mark as a sire of speed, and that was the horse known as\r\nLewis’ Engineer, the sire of the world beater, Lady Suffolk. Burdick’s\r\nEngineer, another son, was taken to Washington County, New York, and got\r\nthe dam of the famous Princess, which produced the great Happy Medium.\r\nIn all these instances there was commingling with other strains from\r\nMessenger.\r\n\r\nCOMMANDER.—This was a grey horse, fully sixteen hands high and of massive\r\nproportions. He was a son of imported Messenger and out of a mare by\r\nimported Rockingham. This Rockingham was not a thoroughbred horse.\r\nCommander was bred in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and found his way to\r\nLong Island about 1812, where he was liberally patronized. His name\r\nfrequently occurs among the remote crosses of good pedigrees, but his\r\nfame rests wholly on the progeny of his son, Young Commander, who was\r\nthe sire of Screwdriver, Screws, Bull Calf and other good ones. This\r\nhorse Young Commander was sometimes called “Bull” and sometimes “American\r\nCommander.”\r\n\r\nMESSENGER, (BUSH’S), generally known as BUSH MESSENGER. This son of\r\nMessenger was bred by James Dearin, of Dutchess County, New York, and\r\nwas foaled 1807. His dam was a Virginia mare, named Queen Ann, by Celer,\r\nson of imported Janus, and out of a mare by Skipwith’s Figure, son of\r\nimported Figure, and she out of a mare imported by Colonel Miland, of\r\nVirginia. This pedigree was not accepted without some misgivings, but\r\nas it was possible and as it had been indorsed sixty years ago by\r\nCadwallader R. Colden and published before that by Mr. Dearin, I am\r\ndisposed to accept it as reliable.\r\n\r\nHe was sixteen hands high, a light grey, becoming white with age. He\r\nwas excellent in form and probably the most handsome and attractive\r\nof all the sons of Messenger. The first public notice we have of him,\r\nhe was advertised at the stable of his breeder, six miles south of\r\nPoughkeepsie, in 1813. Soon after this he became the property of Philo\r\nC. Bush, and this was the first horse, he says, that he ever owned. This\r\nMr. Bush was a noted “character” in his day. From early manhood, through\r\ngood and evil report, and until he died a very old man in poverty and\r\nwant, he was a habitue of the race track. He knew all about race horses\r\nand their breeding, and he could prattle pedigrees from morning till\r\nnight. Added to this knowledge which his life pursuits had placed in\r\nhis possession, he was endowed with a most vivid imagination which was\r\nbrought into the most active play whenever he found it necessary. To\r\nmaintain his “reputation” it seemed to be a necessity that he should be\r\nable to extend all pedigrees laid before him and give the remote crosses,\r\nwhether he knew anything about them or not. He was the author of the\r\nrunning pedigree given to the dam of Major Winfield—Edward Everett, son\r\nof Hambletonian—and on it money was won in a bet. An investigation of\r\njust two minutes disclosed the facts that by established and known dates\r\nthe whole thing was utterly impossible. He was literally a very “racy”\r\n_raconteur_, but his reminiscences soon became tedious, notwithstanding\r\ntheir brilliancy, and it was always important to have a call to some\r\nbusiness that cut off further entertainment from his _répertoire_.\r\n\r\nMr. Bush says he paid one thousand seven hundred and forty dollars and\r\na silver watch for this horse, and with him he got an elegant suit of\r\nclothing that had belonged to imported Express. It is said that he never\r\nran but one race and that was at Pine Plains, in which he distanced\r\nall his competitors in the first heat. In 1816 Mr. Bush kept him at\r\nKinderhook; 1817 at Kinderhook and Schodack; 1818 at Kinderhook and\r\nAlbany; 1819-20 at Utica. In the autumn of 1820 he was sold to Dr.\r\nMillington, of Crooked Lake, Herkimer County, and he was kept there\r\n1821-22. He was then sold to Edward Reynolds, of East Bloomfield, where\r\nhe was kept three or four years, after which he made one or more seasons\r\nat Le Roy, and he died at East Bloomfield in July, 1829. This horse had\r\nprobably more trotting speed than any of the other sons of Messenger. Mr.\r\nBush assured me that he could trot very fast for a horse of that day, and\r\nwhen led by the side of another horse he could beat three minutes very\r\neasily, but as we have to take Mr. Bush’s assertions _cum grano salis_,\r\nwe fortunately have very reliable testimony of contemporaneous date and\r\nfrom a source wholly disinterested. I have before me a letter written\r\nby Judge J. Porter, of East Bloomfield, dated June 4, 1828, in reply to\r\ninquiries from some correspondent about the horse, his terms, etc. He\r\nwrites as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I should think he was a very swift _trotter from what I have\r\n    seen_, and very sprightly and nearly white. He has got a\r\n    great number of fine colts in this town which are three years\r\n    old; and the probability of their drawing on the old horse’s\r\n    business is the reason of his being removed to Le Roy and\r\n    Batavia.”\r\n\r\nWhether Judge Porter was a horseman or not he certainly reflected, in\r\nthis remark which I have emphasized, the leading quality for which Bush\r\nMessenger was distinguished in that region _and in that day_.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was certainly a very fast natural trotter, it is not known\r\nthat he was ever trained an hour in his life, neither is it known that\r\nany fast or trained trotters ever came from his loins. This was the\r\nperiod of fast mail coaches running from Albany to Buffalo, and as the\r\nold proprietors of those great lines were pushed westward from State to\r\nState until they finally were driven across the Mississippi, I have many\r\ntimes heard them talk of the great slashing grey Messenger teams that\r\nwould carry their coaches along at ten miles an hour, and lament that\r\nthere were no such horses nowadays. There were other sons of Messenger\r\nand many grandsons, all known as “Messengers,” but as a progenitor of\r\nhorses suited to the stage coach this particular one that broke his neck\r\nin trying to get out of his inclosure was the premier. He probably came\r\nnearer filling the place in this country that his grandsire filled in\r\nEngland—English Mambrino—than any other one of the tribe, for we can\r\ntruly say of him, as Pick said of his grandsire, “from his blood the\r\nbreed of horses for the coach was brought nearly to perfection.”\r\n\r\nPOTOMAC was a bright bay, fifteen and a half hands high, and was bred by\r\nDaniel Youngs, of Oyster Bay, Long Island. He was foaled 1796 and got by\r\nimported Messenger; dam by imported Figure; grandam by Bashaw. He was\r\nput on the turf in the spring of 1799 and was a respectable race horse\r\nat short distances. He ran against and beat some of the best of his day.\r\nHe was on the turf about three years. In the midst of his racing career\r\nhe was purchased by Mr. Van Ranst for five hundred pounds. In 1802 he\r\nwas owned by Major William Jones, of Cold Spring Harbor, and made some\r\nseasons there. In 1806 he was at New Windsor, Orange County, New York. In\r\n1808 he was in charge of Thomas Jackson, at Rahway, New Jersey, and 1811\r\nat Crosswicks, near Trenton, New Jersey. It is probable he died about\r\nthis time, as we find no further trace of him. Most of his stock were\r\nbays, of good size, and very salable animals. Nothing can now be recalled\r\nthat connects him with any of the trotting strains coming from his sire.\r\nHe was not strictly running-bred on the side of his dam.\r\n\r\nTIPPOO SAIB was a bay horse with one white foot and was fully sixteen\r\nhands high, with plenty of bone. He was foaled 1795, got by imported\r\nMessenger; dam Mr. Thompson’s imported mare by Northumberland; grandam\r\nby Snap, etc. His fine size and elegant pedigree made Tippoo Saib a\r\nvery desirable horse to breed to, but for some cause he did not appear\r\nmuch on the turf. He ran a few races and went into the stud early, in\r\nthe neighborhood of Trenton, New Jersey, and in the following year was\r\nat Goshen, Fishkill, and Pine Plains, New York. My impression is he was\r\nthen returned to West Jersey and Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where he was\r\nprobably owned in his latter days. His sons Tippoo Sultan, Financier and\r\nothers, acquired great fame on the turf. His connection with the trotting\r\nlines of descent is very distinct, but not very prominent.\r\n\r\nSIR SOLOMON was got by imported Messenger; dam Camilla by Cephalus;\r\ngrandam Camilla by imported Fearnought and out of imported Calista, etc.\r\nHe was foaled about 1800, bred by General Gunn, of Georgia, who seems\r\nto have kept Camilla and perhaps others in the North for the purpose\r\nof breeding. The pedigree on the side of this dam is an excellent one\r\nand would seem to justify the owner in seeking to get the best crosses\r\npossible into his stud. When five years old he was sold to Mr. Bond, of\r\nPhiladelphia, for two thousand dollars. His races were numerous and often\r\nsuccessful, beating some of the best horses of his day, and among them\r\nthe famous Miller’s Damsel, also by Messenger, over the Harlem Course in\r\nheats of four miles. Not much is known of his stud services, and he seems\r\nto have been kept several years in Union County, New Jersey. He seems to\r\nhave labored under the disadvantage of having a greater horse of the same\r\nname—Badger’s Sir Solomon by Tickle Toby—in competition with him, and\r\nthus the son of Tickle Toby would steal many a chaplet from the brow of\r\nhis namesake, the son of Messenger.\r\n\r\nOGDEN MESSENGER was a grey horse, foaled 1806, got by imported Messenger;\r\ndam Katy Fisher, by imported Highflyer; grandam a mare imported\r\nby H. N. Cruger in 1786, by Cottager; great-grandam by Trentham;\r\ngreat-great-grandam by Henricus; great-great-great-grandam by Regulus.\r\nThe pedigree of this dam is correct, and she was doubtless entitled to\r\nrank as thoroughbred. This horse was bred by Mr. Cruger, and at three\r\nyears old was sold to David Ogden, and that summer he was pastured on the\r\nfarm of Major William Jones, of Long Island, from whose books we have\r\nthe foregoing facts. Mr. David W. Jones remarks: “I retain a perfect\r\nrecollection of him. He was at that time a large overgrown colt, not\r\nparticularly ugly nor exceedingly coarse, but having no special beauty\r\nnor finish. I cannot better describe him than to say he was a coarse\r\npattern of a fine horse, with marked traits of his lineage.” Mr. Jones\r\nevidently saw him at his worst age and before he fully reached his\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nJudge Odgen, his owner, was a large landholder in St. Lawrence County,\r\nNew York, and in the spring of 1810 he removed from New Jersey to an\r\nisland of eight hundred acres in the St. Lawrence river, opposite the\r\nvillage of Haddington, and took the horse, then four years old, with him.\r\nIt is not known that he ever ran a race for money, and it is not probable\r\nhe ever did, for it was his owner’s aim and object to improve the stock\r\nof the country as well as his own, in which he was successful. After five\r\nor six years he was taken to Lowville in Lewis County, and made several\r\nseasons there in charge of Charles Bush, and from this fact he came to\r\nbe known there, locally, as Bush Messenger. Thus it happened that there\r\nwere two sons of imported Messenger in the State of New York at the same\r\ntime, and both known as Bush Messenger, and to these we might add a\r\ngrandson and a great-grandson in the State of Maine, and at later date\r\nboth named “Bush Messenger.” It was at one time supposed that Mr. Ogden’s\r\nhorse while at Lowville became the sire of the famous Tippoo of Canada\r\nthat became the head of a very valuable tribe of trotters and pacers,\r\nbut later developments showed that this was a mistake. (He appears to\r\nhave alternated in his services between Lewis and Jefferson counties,\r\nbut whether weekly or yearly I cannot state. He was taken to Lowville as\r\nearly as 1815 and was there five or six years.)\r\n\r\nThe facts about this horse have been developed from much correspondence\r\nwith different parties, but more especially from Mr. V. Sheldon, of\r\nCanton, New York, and from Mr. P. F. Daniels, of Prescott, Ontario. Both\r\nmen knew the horse personally, and Mr. Daniels was seventy-five years\r\nold when he wrote. He still had a very clear recollection of the horse\r\nin his appearance and style of action. In describing him he says: “He\r\nwas peculiarly marked about his hocks and knees, having a series of dark\r\nrings about his limbs, continuing at intervals down to his hoofs, and\r\nmany of his sons and daughters were marked the same way.” Having ridden\r\nhim many times he says: “He; had a long flinging step and was a fast\r\ntrotter. His action was high and not easy to the rider, and he could not\r\nwiden behind as some of our modern trotters.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Daniels was a young man he was engaged in carrying the mail,\r\nand in March, 1821, he believes it was, Judge Ogden gave him an order to\r\nbring the horse home from Lewis County. He led him all the way behind his\r\nmail conveyance and delivered him safely to young Mr. Ogden, who gave\r\nhim to an Irish groom named Daley, and Daley remarked he would soon make\r\nhim look like another horse. That night he gave him an overfeed of corn\r\nand he died of colic. He was never advertised while at home and he was\r\nnot very liberally patronized. The Freemans and the Archibalds, however,\r\nMr. Daniels says, bred to him largely. His stock were good and many of\r\nthem excellent, especially those descended through his sons Blossom and\r\nFreeman’s Messenger.\r\n\r\nMAMBRINO (GREY).—This son of Messenger was foaled about 1800, his dam\r\nwas by Pulaski, grandam by Wilkes; great-grandam by True Briton. He was\r\nbred by Benjamin C. Ridgeway, near Mount Holly, New Jersey. In 1807 he\r\nstood at Flemington under the name of Fox Hunter. He was purchased by\r\nRichard Isaac Cooper, who resold him to William Atkinson for about one\r\nthousand two hundred dollars. He was a flea-bitten grey, mane and tail\r\nwhite, handsome and stylish, about sixteen hands high, head medium size,\r\nand a good, well-formed horse at every point, except his feet, which were\r\nbig and flat. He was probably never harnessed and was a very popular\r\nstallion in Salem and adjoining counties for many years. Mr. Atkinson was\r\na very prominent and influential member of the Society of Friends, and\r\n“Billy” Atkinson was always a welcome guest as he traveled through Salem,\r\nGloucester, and Burlington counties with his horse, and his genial good\r\nhumor made him as popular as his horse. He always claimed great speed\r\nfor his horse; but owing to his position in the society he never could\r\ngratify his friends by showing it. When his offspring came into service\r\nthey were not only performers of great merit on the road and the course,\r\nbut they had bone and substance that fitted them for every kind of labor\r\nrequired of them. All the Quakers had Mambrinos and nothing else, after\r\n“Billy” Atkinson and his horse had been among them a few years. Some of\r\nhis descendants attained to great local fame as trotters and some did\r\nwell as runners. He was a very valuable horse and left a wonderfully\r\nnumerous and valuable offspring.\r\n\r\nBLACK MESSENGER.—Among all the progeny of Messenger, this is the only one\r\nthat I can now recall that was black. He was bred by William Haselton,\r\nof Burlington County, New Jersey, and out of a mare highly prized in the\r\nHaselton family, but her blood cannot now be traced. He was foaled in\r\n1801 and on the death of Mr. Haselton in 1804 he was sold to Charles or\r\nRichard Wilkins of Evesham, ten miles from Camden, New Jersey, who owned\r\nhim till he died at an advanced age. As the birth of this horse is fixed\r\nby documentary evidence at 1801 it suggests that Messenger was kept in\r\nBurlington County, New Jersey, the unplaced season of 1800. Still as he\r\nwas at Lawrenceville in the fall season of 1800 it is possible the mare\r\nwas sent to him there. He was full sixteen hands high and possessed great\r\nmuscular development and strength of bone. He was not handsome, but his\r\nfigure and style were very commanding. In his day he was regarded as one\r\nof the best natural trotters ever in Burlington or Gloucester counties.\r\nThis was not the claim of his owner merely, but the unprejudiced opinion\r\nof all the horsemen who knew him. His stock were very highly prized as\r\nhorses suited to all purposes and especially for fast road work. Some of\r\nthem were greatly distinguished locally as fast trotters, and among them\r\nwas Nettle, the dam of the famous Dutchman, that was the greatest trotter\r\nof his day.\r\n\r\nWHYNOT MESSENGER, Pizzant’s Messenger, Austin’s Messenger, and Cousin’s\r\nMessenger were all sons of Messenger and got by him while he was in West\r\nJersey, but as nothing has been developed concerning their maternal\r\nbreeding nor the character of their progeny, I will pass them over with\r\nthis bare record that such horses existed.\r\n\r\nSARATOGA.—This son of Messenger was a flea-bitten grey and was foaled\r\nabout 1805. It is believed he was bred on Long Island, but nothing\r\nis known of the blood of his dam. He was driven in harness and did\r\nservice in several counties in Pennsylvania, and was sold at auction in\r\nPhiladelphia to James Dubois of Salem, New Jersey. He was a great, strong\r\nhorse, and was kept at work on the farm of his owner, covering mares only\r\nas opportunity offered. He was a slashing trotter, but it was only when\r\nhis owner was away from home and got an extra drink or two that anybody\r\never had an opportunity to see how fast he could go. A number of his\r\nprogeny were fast trotters; among them a mare called Charlotte Gray that\r\nwas the fastest of her day in all that region. Among his sons, one called\r\nDove was greatly distinguished in the stud.\r\n\r\nNESTOR AND DELIGHT.—These were sons of Messenger, the former bred in\r\nOrange County, New York, in 1802, and was at Warwick in that county, 1807\r\nin charge of Nehemiah Finn. The latter was bred in Westchester County\r\nin 1806, and made the season of 1827 at Warwick, New York, in charge of\r\nJohn G. Blauvelt, and is probably the horse that was more widely known as\r\nBlauvelt’s Messenger. The breeding of the dams of both these horses is\r\nvery uncertain.\r\n\r\nMOUNT HOLLY was a grey horse, fifteen and a half hands high. He was\r\nfoaled about 1807 and was bred by Colonel Udell, of Long Island. His dam\r\nwas by Bajazet, and his grandam was by Bashaw. Not much is known of him\r\ntill he was well advanced in years and was taken to Dutchess County.\r\nDaniel T. Cock knew him well on the island, and he assured me he was a\r\ntrotter in the true sense of the word. The late Mr. Daniel B. Haight, a\r\nhorseman of excellent judgment and knowledge, knew him very well, and he\r\ndescribes him as of the true Messenger grey, and a smooth, well-finished\r\nhorse all over. His offspring were smooth, handsome, and remarkably\r\ntough, and from their kindly tempers they were easily managed and made\r\nhorses fit for any service. The most noted of his get were the famous\r\ntrotters Paul Pry and Mr. Tredwell’s grey mare that went to England.\r\nHis cross appears in the pedigrees of many trotters and is very highly\r\nprized to this day. In the latter part of his life he was owned by Jacob\r\nHusted, of Washington Hollow, New York, and made several seasons there.\r\nHis sight failed entirely as he grew old, and he died about 1835. With\r\ntwo such performers from his own loins as Paul Pry and the Tredwell mare,\r\nit cannot be doubted that he inherited and transmitted the true Messenger\r\n“trotting instinct,” and that without any assistance from the blood of\r\nhis dam.\r\n\r\nPLATO was a large brown horse, fully sixteen hands high, and was a full\r\nbrother to Bishop’s Hambletonian, being by Messenger, out of Pheasant.\r\nHe was bred by General Coles, of Long Island, and was foaled 1802. As\r\nhe matured the general judgment was that his limbs were too light for\r\nhis body, and this is the only instance that I can recall where the get\r\nof Messenger failed at this vital point. He was trained and ran a few\r\nraces, and from a trial with Miller’s Damsel General Coles said he was\r\nthe best horse that ever ran against that famous mare. In a race against\r\nhis half-brother, Sir Solomon, he won the first heat of four miles and\r\nbroke down in the second, which finished him as a race horse. He was a\r\nlarger and a handsomer horse than his full brother Hambletonian, but at\r\nno other point was he so good. When they stood in the same stable he was\r\nadvertised at a lower price. He was a number of years in the stud on Long\r\nIsland, New Jersey, and the river counties of New York, and after 1816 at\r\nPine Plains there is no further trace of him. In his physical structure\r\nand doubtless, in his mental structure also, he took after his dam, and\r\nthe only link now recalled coupling him with the trotter is the fact that\r\nhe was the sire of the dam of Lewis’ Engineer, that was the sire of the\r\ngreat Lady Suffolk.\r\n\r\nDOVER MESSENGER was a grey horse, and was got by imported Messenger, but\r\nthe blood of his dam and the year he was foaled are unknown. He was kept\r\nseveral seasons at South Dover, Dutchess County, New York, and left a\r\nvery valuable progeny strongly endowed with the instinct to trot. He was\r\ntaken to the town of Russia, in Herkimer County, where he died. There\r\nwas a younger horse bearing practically the same name, a son of Mambrino\r\nPaymaster, with which this horse has often been confounded.\r\n\r\nCORIANDER.—This son of Messenger was a bay horse, about fifteen and a\r\nhalf hands high; was foaled in Queens County, New York, about 1796, and\r\nhis dam was by Allen’s Brown Figure; grandam by Rainbow; great-grandam by\r\nDauphin. He seems to have been kept on Long Island as long as he lived.\r\nHis progeny was much like their sire, and Mr. D. W. Jones describes them\r\nas “clean, wiry, and brilliant. In their make-up there seemed nothing\r\nwasted and nothing wanted.” He ran some races, as did many of his get.\r\nHe was bred upon one of the early daughters of Hambletonian, and she\r\nproduced the great trotter “Old Topgallant,” the sensation of his period\r\nand one of the most famous of the very early trotters. One of the most\r\nremarkable facts in the history of this remarkable old gelding is that he\r\nran some races before he was trained to trot.\r\n\r\nFAGDOWN.—This son of Messenger was bred on the Jersey side of the\r\nDelaware, not far from Philadelphia, and was foaled, I think, in 1803.\r\nHis dam was represented to be by Diomed, and if this be correct it must\r\nhave been Tate’s imported Diomed that was imported into New Jersey\r\nand kept there a number of years. This was a bay horse and must not\r\nbe confounded with the chestnut horse of the same name imported into\r\nVirginia. Fagdown became vicious and dangerous, and from this trait in\r\nhis character he was generally called the “Man Eater.” He was kept in the\r\nregion of Philadelphia and south of there for many years, and left a very\r\nnumerous and very valuable progeny. They were noted for their superior\r\nqualities as road horses, and some of them were very fast, for their\r\nday. For a number of years no family of horses were so popular about\r\nPhiladelphia as the Fagdowns. He had a son called Cropped Fagdown that\r\nwas fast, and another son called Jersey Fagdown that trotted some races\r\nagainst the great Andrew Jackson. Another son, named after his sire, was\r\nbred in Northeastern Maryland, and was taken to Eastern Ohio in 1829,\r\nand he was kept in Columbiana, Mahoning, and Jefferson counties for at\r\nleast ten years. He was never in a race nor never trained, but his Quaker\r\npatrons all insisted that when led by the side of another horse he could\r\ntrot as fast as a pretty good horse could run. This grandson of Messenger\r\nwas the sire of the grandam of Wapsie, the well-known trotter and sire of\r\nIowa.\r\n\r\nBRIGHT PHŒBUS was foaled 1804, the same year as Hambletonian. He was out\r\nof the imported Pot-8-os mare, and his breeder, General Coles, of Long\r\nIsland, sold him to Bond and Hughes, of Philadelphia. His most noted\r\nachievement was at Washington, D. C., in 1808, when in a sweepstakes he\r\nmore than distanced the great Sir Archy, by catching him when he had the\r\ndistemper. His racing career was respectable, but not brilliant, and when\r\nthat ended it is not known what became of him.\r\n\r\nSLASHER, SHAFTSBURY, HOTSPUR.—There was quite a famous brood mare\r\nowned somewhere in Jersey called Jenny Duter, or Jenny Oiter, as some\r\nauthorities have it. She was got by True Briton; dam Quaker Lass by\r\nimported Juniper; grandam Molly Pacolet, by imported Pacolet, etc.,\r\ntracing on six or eight more crosses that are all fudge. This mare was\r\nbred to Messenger about 1801, and produced Shaftsbury; her daughter by\r\nLiberty was bred to him about the same time and produced Slasher, and\r\nabout the same time her granddaughter by Slender was also bred to him and\r\nproduced Hotspur. These three sons of Messenger do not seem to have ever\r\nbeen trained, and very little of their history can be traced, except that\r\nthey were kept as stallions in different parts of New Jersey. It is not\r\nknown that their blood has had any influence upon the American trotting\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER (HUTCHINSON’S).—This was a large grey horse, foaled in 1792,\r\nand bred by Mathias Hutchinson, of Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia. His\r\ndam was by Hunt’s Grey Figure, son of imported Figure. He was kept in\r\nMonmouth County, New Jersey, 1797, and it is probable that he was often\r\nrepresented as imported Messenger himself. I have no knowledge of this\r\nhorse or his progeny beyond the mere facts here given.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER (COOPER’S).—This son of imported Messenger was generally\r\nknown as “Cooper’s Grey” and sometimes as Ringgold. He was sixteen\r\nhands high and was foaled about 1803. He was bred in Montgomery County,\r\nPennsylvania, and was kept about Philadelphia, on both sides of the\r\nDelaware, till 1821, when he was sold by the administrators of Jacob\r\nKirk, and it has been said he was taken to the Wabash by Amos Cooper. He\r\nran some races when he was young, and was a horse of a good deal of local\r\nfame. He was liberally patronized in the stud and left valuable progeny.\r\nIt has been suggested that probably he was the sire of Amazonia, the dam\r\nof Abdallah; but as there is nothing to support this suggestion except\r\nthe mere matter of location, and as all that has ever been claimed for\r\nher paternity is that she was by “a son of Messenger,” we must not forget\r\nthat there were plenty of other sons of Messenger in the same locality\r\nthat might have been her sire.\r\n\r\nThe name “Messenger” was more sadly abused in its duplication in the\r\nclosing of the last and the early decades of the present century than\r\nthat of any other horse, or perhaps of all other horses of that period\r\nput together. Multitudes of his sons were called “Messenger,” and, in\r\nthe next generation, multitudes of his grandsons gloried in the same\r\ncognomen, and thus generation after generation perpetuated it, in\r\nwidening circles, till “confusion became worse confounded,” leaving the\r\nhistorian in helpless and hopeless ignorance as to what was true and\r\nwhat was false. When grey horses in the second, third, or fourth remove\r\nfrom the imported horse became old, it required but little “diplomacy”\r\nto satisfy the public that they were true sons of the original, and this\r\nbecame the custom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALIX.\r\n\r\nBy Patronage, record 2:03¾, the fastest to this date.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER’S DESCENDANTS.\r\n\r\n    History of Abdallah—Characteristics of his dam,\r\n    Amazonia—Speculations as to her blood—Description of\r\n    Abdallah—Almack, progenitor of the Champion line—Mambrino\r\n    Paymaster, sire of Mambrino Chief—History and pedigree—Mambrino\r\n    Messenger—Harris’ Hambletonian—Judson’s Hambletonian—Andrus’\r\n    Hambletonian, sire of the famous Princess, Happy Medium’s dam.\r\n\r\n\r\nABDALLAH.—This grandson of Messenger has been popularly and justly\r\ndesignated as the “king of trotting sires of his generation.” He was bred\r\nby John Tredwell, of Queens County, Long Island, and was foaled 1823.\r\nHis sire was Mambrino, son of Messenger, and his dam was Amazonia, one\r\nof the most distinguished trotters of her day. Concerning the breeding\r\nand origin of Amazonia there has been great diversity of opinion among\r\nhorsemen and a great amount of controversy among writers. It is not my\r\npurpose to enter into a discussion of the questions raised on this point,\r\nbut I would hardly be doing justice to history to pass it over unnoticed.\r\nI will, therefore, try to give a brief synopsis of the history and the\r\narguments urged, and refer the reader to the first and second volumes of\r\n_Wallace’s Monthly_ for a more extended consideration of the questions\r\nraised.\r\n\r\nThe first representation of her pedigree was that she was a daughter of\r\nimported Messenger, and the next was that she was by a son of Messenger.\r\nOn the first claim, that she was by Messenger, no argument was possible,\r\none way or the other, on account of dates; but against the second claim,\r\nthat she was by a son of Messenger, the arguments were numerous and\r\nvehement. All these arguments were based wholly upon her coarse external\r\nconformation and the absence of all resemblance to the Messenger family.\r\nAmong the supporters of this view were many of the most intelligent and\r\ntrustworthy horsemen of the whole country. Indeed, the preponderance of\r\nintelligence as well as numbers seemed to be on that side. That she had\r\n“coarse, ragged hips,” that she had a “rat tail,” that she “had hair\r\nenough on her legs to stuff a mattress,” that she was “a muddy sorrel,”\r\netc., were all urged to prove that she was not by a son of Messenger. It\r\nis true that many entered into this controversy who never saw the mare\r\nand who knew nothing about her appearance, but there were others who knew\r\nher perfectly, among them my venerable friend David W. Jones, to whom\r\nwe are all indebted for so many treasures from his storehouse of very\r\nvaluable memories.\r\n\r\nOn the other side there were some little scraps of history, that at\r\nthe vital point may have been history or may have been fiction. In the\r\ncertificate of sale of Abdallah, April 27, 1830, to Mr. Isaac Snediker,\r\nhis breeder, Mr. John Tredwell, says: “And believe him to be the very\r\n_best bred_ trotting stallion in this country, and be it enough to know\r\nthat his sire was Mambrino and his dam Amazonia.” It has been argued\r\nthat it would be very inconsistent for a man of Mr. Tredwell’s standing\r\nto certify that Abdallah “was the very best bred trotting stallion in\r\nthis country,” if he knew nothing of the blood of his dam, drawing the\r\ninference that he must have known and believed the representations\r\nof his nephew, B. T. Kissam, from whom he got Amazonia. The story of\r\nthe original purchase of Amazonia by B. T. Kissam and given to me by\r\nhis brother, Timothy T. Kissam, in 1870, is as follows: Amazonia was\r\npurchased by B. T. Kissam, a dry goods merchant of New York, when on an\r\nexcursion of pleasure in the vicinity of Philadelphia about 1814. She was\r\nbrought out of a team and was then four years old past, his attention\r\nhaving been called to her as an animal of much promise. He used her for\r\nhis own driving a short time and sold her to his uncle, John Tredwell.\r\n“Amazonia was represented to my brother to have been a get of imported\r\nMessenger.”\r\n\r\nNow, in considering whether this scrap of history is probably true, the\r\ngeographical question has been urged with telling effect. Messenger had\r\nbeen kept a number of years on both sides of the Delaware, right on the\r\nway to Philadelphia, his fee had been above that of any other stallion,\r\nand a large percentage of his colts had been kept entire. In no part of\r\nthe country, perhaps, were there so many sons of Messenger seeking public\r\npatronage. The geography and the chronology of the question, therefore,\r\nboth sustain the probability of its truthfulness. Whether Mr. Kissam\r\ncrossed the river at Trenton, or Burlington, or Camden he was right in\r\nthe hotbed of the sons of Messenger. “If Amazonia” it has been asked,\r\n“was as coarse and forbidding as represented in her appearance, what\r\ninduced Mr. Kissam to buy her?” He wanted a carriage horse and he wanted\r\none that could not only show good action, but one that had a right of\r\ninheritance to good action. He knew the Messengers and knew that beauty\r\nand style were not family traits in that tribe. Many of them were coarse,\r\nand possibly as coarse as Amazonia. Her very coarseness and lack of style\r\nis, under the circumstances, a strong argument that in choosing her Mr.\r\nKissam had regard for her Messenger blood.\r\n\r\nAnother argument, resting on “the internal evidences,” has been urged\r\nwith considerable force and it is very hard to answer it. Amazonia was a\r\nmare of tested and known speed. She was in a number of races to saddle\r\nand had won several of them in less than three minutes along about\r\n1816-18, and when Major William Jones, in 1820, accepted the challenge to\r\nproduce a horse that could trot a mile in three minutes for one thousand\r\ndollars, he knew very well what he was doing, for he had seen Amazonia\r\ndo it a number of times. Her best time was about 2:54, which in that day\r\nwas considered phenomenally fast. If we were to meet a running horse out\r\non the plains that could run away from all others, we would naturally\r\nand justly conclude that he had some of the blood of the race horse in\r\nhis veins. If we have a pacer and we learn he came from a section of the\r\ncountry where a certain tribe of pacers abounded, we would naturally\r\nconclude that he belonged to that tribe, especially if we knew there\r\nwere no other pacers in that section. If we have a trotter that can go\r\naway from all other trotters, and we know that this trotter came from\r\na section abounding in a family of trotters, and in nothing else that\r\ncan trot, we naturally and justly conclude that this trotter came from\r\nsome member of that family of trotters. This argument from the “internal\r\nevidences” seems almost axiomatic, and when taken in connection with the\r\nhistorical argument, unsatisfactory though it be, they together lay the\r\nfoundation for a very strong probability that Amazonia was by a son of\r\nMessenger.\r\n\r\nAbdallah was in color a beautiful bay, about fifteen and a half hands\r\nhigh, and there was a measure of coarseness about him that he could not\r\nwell escape, as both his sire and dam were endowed with that undesirable\r\nquality. The one exception to this was in the character of his coat,\r\nwhich was very fine and glossy when in healthy condition. His reputation\r\nas a great trotting sire was very widely extended during his lifetime,\r\nbut his lack of symmetry and his “rat tail,” which he inherited from his\r\ndam, so impaired his acceptability with the public that he never was very\r\nlargely patronized. Besides this he had an unconquerable will of his own,\r\nwhich he transmitted to his offspring very generally. This willfulness\r\nwas not a desirable quality in a horse for drudgery, and hence most of\r\nhis patrons were such as were seeking for gameness and speed. When he\r\nwas four years old he was not in the stud, and it is understood that Mr.\r\nTredwell undertook to break him thoroughly and train him that year. It is\r\nalso understood that when put in harness he kicked everything to pieces\r\nwithin his reach and that all thoughts of training were soon abandoned.\r\nHe never was in harness again until, in extreme old age, he was sold for\r\nfive dollars to a fish peddler, and the peddler’s wagon was soon reduced\r\nto kindling wood.\r\n\r\nHe was kept at different points on Long Island, and one season in New\r\nJersey, till the fall of 1839, when he, with Commodore, another son of\r\nMambrino, was sold to Mr. John W. Hunt, of Lexington, Kentucky, where\r\nthey made the season of 1840. Commodore was much the more attractive\r\nhorse of the two, and did a large business, while Abdallah was almost\r\nwholly neglected, leaving only about half a dozen colts. Meantime\r\nhis progeny on the island began to show their speed and their racing\r\nqualities; a company was formed and he was brought back from Kentucky and\r\nmade the seasons of 1841 and 1842 at the Union Course, Long Island. He\r\nwas at Goshen, New York, 1843, at Freehold, New Jersey, 1844 and 1845, at\r\nChester, New York, 1846-47-48, at Bull’s Head, New York, 1849, and did\r\nnothing, then at the Union Course and Patchogue, Long Island, and was not\r\noff the island again. After the period of his usefulness was past his\r\ninhuman owners turned him out on a bleak, sandy beach on the Long Island\r\nshore, and there he starved to death in the piercing November winds,\r\nwithout a shelter or a friend.\r\n\r\nAbdallah was the sire of Hambletonian, 10, the greatest of all trotting\r\nprogenitors and greater than all others combined. This fact alone has\r\nmade his name imperishable in the annals of the trotting horse. A number\r\nof his other sons were kept for stallions and some of them lived to old\r\nage, but they were all failures in the stud. His daughters, generally,\r\nproved to be most valuable brood mares, producing speed to almost any\r\nand every cross. A pedigree tracing to an “Abdallah mare” has always\r\nenhanced the value of a family.\r\n\r\nALMACK.—Mr. John Tredwell bred his famous team of driving mares, Amazonia\r\nand Sophonisba, to Mambrino in the spring of 1822, and the next year\r\nthey each produced a bay horse colt that he named Abdallah and Almack.\r\nSophonisba, the dam of Almack, was a superior mare, but she was not fast\r\nenough for her mate. Almack, however, was a good horse and left some\r\ntrotters. I have no particular description of him at hand and nothing\r\ncan now be given of his history further than that some of his daughters\r\nproduced well and that he seems to have been kept all his life on Long\r\nIsland. His dam Sophonisba was got by a grandson of imported Baronet,\r\nas represented, but this is so indefinite as to be unsatisfactory and\r\nsuspicious. As none of the Baronets could ever trot, even “a little bit,”\r\nit is evident that whatever trotting inheritance Almack possessed came\r\nto him from his sire. Aside from a number of his descendants that were\r\nrecognized trotters of merit there was one in particular that established\r\nAlmack as a progenitor of a great family of trotters. A son of his bred\r\nby George Raynor, of Huntington, Long Island, in 1842, and known as the\r\n“Raynor Colt,” out of Spirit by Engineer II., sire of Lady Suffolk, was\r\nled behind a sulky at a fair at Huntington, when he was eighteen months\r\nold, and he went so fast and showed such a magnificent way of doing it,\r\nthat he was named “Champion” by William T. Porter, editor of the _Spirit\r\nof the Times_. At three years old he was driven a full mile in 3:05 and\r\nthis was a “world’s record” for colts of that age at that time. In 1846\r\nhe was purchased by William R. Grinnell for two thousand six hundred\r\ndollars and taken to Cayuga County, where he founded a great tribe of\r\ntrotters that is now known everywhere as the “Champion Family.” A fuller\r\naccount of this horse will be found at another place in this volume.\r\n\r\nMAMBRINO PAYMASTER (widely known in later years as Blind Paymaster).—This\r\nwas a large, strong-boned, dark-bay horse, sixteen hands and an inch\r\nhigh. When young he was somewhat light and leggy, but with age he spread\r\nout and became a horse of substance. He was bred by Azariah Arnold, of\r\nthe town of Washington, in Dutchess County, New York. There is some\r\nuncertainty about the year this horse was foaled, but it was somewhere\r\nbetween 1822 and 1826. He was got by Mambrino, son of Messenger, and his\r\ndam was represented to be by imported Paymaster. The late Mr. Edwin\r\nThorne made a statement a few years ago that in an interview with Azariah\r\nArnold he said that he did not know or remember the horse that was the\r\nsire of the dam. At that time Mr. Arnold was very old, and doubtless his\r\nmental faculties very much impaired, so it would not be remarkable that\r\nhe should have forgotten all about it. On the other hand, Nelson Haight,\r\nDaniel B. Haight, Seth P. Hopson, and others of like high character,\r\nmaintain that Mr. Arnold, in his younger days, always represented the\r\nmare to be by Paymaster, and the name of the horse itself is very strong\r\nevidence that he did so represent it, and is a standing proclamation to\r\nthat effect. There can be no possible doubt that in earlier life Mr.\r\nArnold constantly represented this mare to be by Paymaster; neither can\r\nthere be any reasonable doubt that when his faculties were impaired\r\nwith age he told Mr. Thorne that he did not remember her pedigree. Mr.\r\nArnold’s neighbors all agree that he was a man of unblemished character\r\nand incapable of a willful misrepresentation, when in possession of\r\nhis faculties. Again, that this Paymaster cross was not only possible,\r\nbut probable, is shown by the fact that imported Paymaster was kept by\r\nEbenezer Haight, in the year 1807, in the same township with Azariah\r\nArnold, and the years 1808 and 1809 in the same part of the county.\r\nTherefore, Mr. Thorne to the contrary notwithstanding, I have but little\r\ndoubt that the Paymaster cross is correct.\r\n\r\nHe had a small star in his forehead and a little white on one hind foot.\r\nHis back, loin and hips were altogether superior, and those who knew him\r\nbest say they never saw his equal at these points. His head was large and\r\nbony, with an ear after the Mambrino model. His neck was of medium length\r\nand his shoulder good. His hind legs were quite crooked and too much\r\ncut in below the hock in front, giving the legs at that point a narrow\r\nand weak appearance; his hocks were large and at the curb place showed\r\na fullness. His cannon bones, all round, were short for a horse of his\r\nsize, and his feet were excellent. He was slow in maturing, but when he\r\nfilled out he lost all that narrow, weedy appearance which characterized\r\nhis colthood. He was not beautiful, but powerful.\r\n\r\nAbout 1828 he was sold and taken to Binghamton, New York. Meantime his\r\ncolts came forward and proved to be so valuable that Nelson and Daniel\r\nB. Haight and Gilbert Jones purchased and brought him back to Dutchess\r\nCounty about the year 1840. He was not a sure foal-getter, but his\r\nstock proved to be of great value. When brought back from Broome County\r\nhe was blind. He made one season on Long Island in charge of George\r\nTappan; the other seasons till 1847 he was kept in Dutchess County in the\r\nneighborhood of his owners. In 1847 he was sold to Mr. Gilbert Holmes and\r\ntaken to Vermont, where he died after getting one colt. Many of his sons\r\nwere kept as stallions, but the most famous of his get were the mares\r\nIola and Lady Moore, and last but not least, his famous son Mambrino\r\nChief, the founder of a great family of trotters in Kentucky. His stock\r\nwere probably more noted and more highly prized than that of any of the\r\nsons of Mambrino that stood in Dutchess County. As Abdallah was the\r\nlink by which the greatest of all trotting families are connected with\r\nMessenger, so Mambrino Paymaster is the link through which the family\r\neasily entitled to second place reaches the same illustrious original.\r\n\r\nMAMBRINO JR. (BONE SWINGER) was a beautiful bay horse, foaled 182-, got\r\nby Mambrino, son of Messenger; dam not traced. He was bred on Long Island\r\nand was owned by George Tappan, near Jericho, Long Island. About 1833-4\r\nhe made some seasons at Washington Hollow, Dutchess County. He was about\r\nfifteen hands three inches high and was considered more blood-like and\r\nhandsome than most of his family. He was a strong breeder, giving most of\r\nhis colts his own elegant color.\r\n\r\nMAMBRINO MESSENGER (commonly known as the Burton Horse) was foaled\r\nabout 1821. He was got by Mambrino, son of Messenger; dam by Coffin’s\r\nMessenger, son of Messenger; grandam by Black and All Black;\r\ngreat-grandam by Feather. He was bred by Abram Burton, of Washington\r\nHollow, New York. He was a beautiful bay, about fifteen hands three\r\ninches high, and was the same age as Mambrino Paymaster, and they were\r\nrivals for a number of years, each having his friends and adherents. He\r\nwas finer in the bone, having more finish and beauty than his rival, and\r\nwhat was still more effective with the public, he could out-trot him.\r\nMany of his offspring proved to be most excellent roadsters and some of\r\nthem were fast. He was probably taken to Western New York, but I have\r\nnot found any trace of his location or history. This name, Mambrino\r\nMessenger, was borne by several other horses of different degrees of\r\naffinity to the originals.\r\n\r\nHAMBLETONIAN (HARRIS’) (also known as Bristol Grey and Remington\r\nHorse).—This was a grey horse, about sixteen hands high, and possessed\r\ngreat strength and substance. When young he was an iron grey and probably\r\npretty dark, but as he advanced in age he became lighter in color. His\r\nhead was large and bony, with great width between the eyes. He was short\r\nin the back, with long hips, and the rise of the withers commenced far\r\nback, showing a fine, oblique shoulder. He was a horse of unusually large\r\nbone formation; his limbs were large, but flat and clean, with a heavy\r\ngrowth of hair at the fetlocks. He was of docile and kindly disposition\r\nand worked well either alone or with another. His gait was open and\r\ndecided and at a walk his long slinging steps carried him over the ground\r\nunusually fast. His speed as a trotter was never developed, but his\r\naction at that gait was so free, open and square that those who knew him\r\nwell have insisted that his manner of going indicated the possibility of\r\ngreat improvement, if he had been handled with that view. His offspring\r\nwere slow in maturing, and for many years, indeed till toward the end\r\nof his life, he was not appreciated as a stallion. He was in constant\r\ncompetition with the little, plump, trim and trappy Morgans, and at three\r\nand four years old his long, lathy, plain colts cut but a sorry figure\r\nagainst the well formed and fully developed Morgans of their own age.\r\nWith such a rivalry, sustained by the question of profit to the breeder\r\nby early sales, it is not remarkable that he should have been neglected,\r\ntill it was clearly demonstrated that he transmitted the true Messenger\r\ntrotting instinct in greater strength than any of his competitors.\r\n\r\nHe was bred by Isaac Munson, of Wallingford, Vermont; foaled 1823, got\r\nby Bishop’s Hambletonian, son of Messenger; dam the Munson mare that was\r\nbrought from Boston, 1813. There never has been any question about the\r\nsire of this horse, but up to 1869 the representation made by Mr. Harris\r\nthat his dam was an imported English mare was generally accepted as the\r\ntruth. I was led to doubt this, and in December of that year I made a\r\nthorough search of the records of the custom-house in Boston, and found\r\nthe claim was without any foundation whatever. Through the kindness of\r\nMr. Henry D. Noble I was enabled to get beyond Mr. Harris, who really\r\nknew nothing about the mare, back to the Munson family, and to Mr. Joseph\r\nTucker, the earliest and best authority living in 1870. In order that\r\nthis evidence may be preserved I will here insert Mr. Tucker’s letter\r\nentire.\r\n\r\n                                    “MILFORD, N. H., May 4th, 1870.\r\n\r\n    “MR. J. H. WALLACE, Muscatine, Iowa.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR SIR: Yours of 22d of April is duly received and contents\r\n    noted. I was 24 years old when first acquainted with the dam\r\n    of the ‘Harris Horse,’ so called, in the fall of 1813. Was\r\n    then carrying on a farm, now owned by Wm. Randall, Esq., in\r\n    this town, for Mr. Israel Munson, a commission merchant then\r\n    doing business on India Street, and afterward on Central\r\n    Wharf, Boston. I was in Boston in the fall of 1813, as above,\r\n    and found the dam (of Hambletonian) and mate in Mr. Munson’s\r\n    possession. He said they had been ‘leaders’ in a stage team,\r\n    and they acted as if green about holding back, etc. He never\r\n    said she was imported from England, neither did I hear such\r\n    a story till two or three years ago. The dam was called ‘a\r\n    Messenger.’ All the description I can give of her is that she\r\n    was a strong, well-built, light dapple grey, and would weigh\r\n    ten hundred, certain. The span was well matched. The nigh one\r\n    (the dam) was more serviceable than the other. Led them all the\r\n    way from Boston behind an ox team; kept them till the middle of\r\n    April and then returned the pair to Boston. Mr. Munson drove\r\n    them up, only stopping to dinner, when on his way to Vermont\r\n    in August, 1814, and I didn’t see them again until December. I\r\n    then drove them from Boston to Vermont, and used them a year on\r\n    the Munson farm, on Otter Creek, in Wallingford. In June, 1815,\r\n    I took them to Phœnix Horse (bay, black mane and tail, good\r\n    looking and smart) in Clarendon Flats. Both stood and had foals\r\n    the spring after I left Mr. Munson’s employ. The off mare was\r\n    occasionally a little lame, I think in the off fore foot, when\r\n    hard drove, but the nigh one was perfectly free from lameness\r\n    or limping. I left Mr. Munson in the spring of 1816, and know\r\n    nothing of mares afterward.\r\n\r\n                           “Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                                     JOSEPH TUCKER,\r\n\r\n                                                “(By Geo. W. Fox).”\r\n\r\nI have given this letter entire, with the exception of a few closing\r\nsentences, that the public may be able to judge of its authenticity.\r\nThat these mares were leaders in a stage team when Mr. Munson bought\r\nthem is confirmed by members of the Munson family, and that the nigh\r\nmare was represented to be a Messenger at the time of the purchase I\r\nhave not the least doubt. But whether she was really a Messenger is\r\nquite another question. All I can say is, it was possible in the nature\r\nof things; and the employment and qualities of the mare, together with\r\nthe representations of Mr. Munson, appear to make it probable. During\r\nthe mare’s lifetime I find she was spoken of in the Munson family and\r\nabout Wallingford as “the imported Messenger mare” and in this phrase, no\r\ndoubt, was the origin of the story that she was herself imported. When\r\nthis phrase, through her son, reached the next outer circle, “imported\r\nMessenger mare” no longer meant a mare by imported Messenger, but an\r\nimported mare by Messenger.\r\n\r\nAt the point where Mr. Tucker’s knowledge of this mare ceases,\r\nfortunately Mr. Isaac B. Munson, of Wallingford, takes up the history and\r\ncarries it forward, with great particularity, to the time of her death\r\nabout 1826. She produced several foals by different horses, and while\r\nthey were all valuable animals, the only one that is known to history is\r\nthe subject of this sketch. When Hambletonian of Vermont was two years\r\nold Mr. Munson sold him to Samuel Edgerton and others, of Wallingford,\r\nand they kept him in the stud till about 1828, when they sold him to Mr.\r\nEddy, of Bristol, Vermont, and in the hands of the Eddy family he was\r\nkept at Bristol, New Haven, and other points in and about Addison County\r\ntill about 1835, when he was kept one or two years again in Wallingford\r\nand adjacent towns. About 1837 he was sold to Joshua Remington, of\r\nHuntington, Vermont, and was taken there. He stood in various parts\r\nof Chittenden County, and became well known as the “Remington Horse.”\r\nUnfortunately there is no guide to dates in these transfers and it is\r\nnot known just how long Mr. Remington owned him. He next passed into the\r\nhands of Mr. Russell Harris, New Haven, Connecticut, and remained his\r\ntill he died late in the year 1847.\r\n\r\nThe location of this horse was unfavorable either to a large or to a\r\nnumerous progeny of trotters. He was surrounded with Morgan blood, trappy\r\nand stylish and fast growing in popularity on the supposition that they\r\nwere trotters—a most valuable tribe as family horses, but none of them\r\nwere able to trot fast without the introduction of trotting blood from\r\nthe outside. He lived in a period antedating the real development of the\r\ntrotter and the keeping of records of performances, and hence we must\r\nnot judge of his merits as a trotting sire by comparing the list of his\r\nperformers with lists of later generations. Green Mountain Maid was one\r\nof the best of her day and made a record of 2:28½ in 1853, and the same\r\nyear the famous pacing gelding Hero made a record of 2:20½. Probably\r\nthe best trotter from his loins was Sontag, with a wagon record in 1855\r\nof 2:31. This mare was originally a pacer, and whether his dam was by\r\nimported Messenger or not we must conclude that the tendency to the\r\nlateral action was strong in his progeny. Lady Shannon, Trouble, Vermont,\r\nModesty, and True John were all famous performers in their day. The last\r\nnamed was kept in the stud a few years and was known as the Hanchett\r\nHorse. He fell into the hands of Sim D. Hoagland, of this vicinity,\r\nbecame ugly and was made a gelding. As a weight puller he had no equal\r\nin his day. His daughters became the dams of many noted producers and\r\nperformers, and through the doubling of his blood and its predominating\r\ninfluence we have the famous General Knox and his tribe. But few of his\r\nsons were kept as stallions; among them the best known is Hambletonian,\r\n814, known as the Parris Horse and the sire of the stout campaigner,\r\nJoker, 2:22½. Vermont Hambletonian (known as the Noble or Harrington\r\nHorse) was one of his best and best-bred sons. He died in 1865, leaving a\r\nvaluable progeny.\r\n\r\nHAMBLETONIAN (JUDSON’S) was a brown horse and resembled his sire\r\nvery much in both size and form. He was foaled 1821, got by Bishop’s\r\nHambletonian, son of Messenger; dam by Wells’ Magnum Bonum. This Magnum\r\nBonum family abounded in that region, and it was a very good one,\r\nwhatever the blood may have been. This horse was bred by Judge Underhill,\r\nof Dorset, Vermont, and sold, 1829, to Dr. Nathan Judson, of Pawlet,\r\nVermont. He was kept in that region till he died about 1841. His progeny\r\nwere very numerous and valuable.\r\n\r\nHAMBLETONIAN (ANDRUS’) was a brown horse nearly sixteen hands high.\r\nHe was a well formed and evenly balanced horse, all over, with an\r\nobjectionable lack of bone just below the fore-knee. His head and ear\r\nwere strongly after the Messenger model. I have never been able to\r\ndetermine just who bred him, and consequently his blood on the side\r\nof the dam is not fully established. He was foaled about 1840, got by\r\nJudson’s Hambletonian, and out of a mare which Mr. B. B. Sherman says\r\nwas by old Magnum Bonum. He seems to have known this mare well and\r\nspeaks of her as a very superior animal. This would indicate inbreeding\r\nto the Magnum Bonums, and as they were a light-limbed family we may\r\naccount for this horse’s defects in that respect. He was owned a number\r\nof years by Mr. Andrus, of Pawlet, and passed into the hands of G. A.\r\nAustin, of Orwell, Vermont. In 1853-4 Mr. Austin sent him to Illinois,\r\nalong with Drury’s Ethan Allen, Black Hawk Prophet, Morgan Tiger and\r\nsome other stallions, in charge of Mr. Wetherbee, for sale. In 1854\r\nthey were removed to Muscatine, Iowa, and several of them sold there,\r\namong them the Andrus Horse. He was then stiff in his limbs, showing the\r\neffects of previous neglect and abuse. He died at Muscatine in 1857.\r\nHis progeny there were defective in bone. I am told several of his\r\ndaughters in Vermont have left good stock there and thus perpetuated\r\nhis name in the second and third generations. But his chief title to\r\nfame has been secured to him by his renowned daughter Princess, the dam\r\nof the great Happy Medium. In 1851 Mr. L. B. Adams, who then owned her,\r\nbred the Isaiah Wilcox mare, by Burdick’s Engineer, son of Engineer by\r\nMessenger, to Andrus’ Hambletonian, and, in a nutshell, the union of this\r\ngreat-grandson of Messenger with this great-granddaughter of Messenger\r\nproduced Princess. This pedigree of Princess is incontrovertibly\r\nestablished and will be given in fuller detail in the history of her son,\r\nHappy Medium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAMBLETONIAN (RYSDYK’S).\r\n\r\nThe greatest of all trotting progenitors and the most intensely inbred to\r\nMessenger.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nHAMBLETONIAN AND HIS FAMILY.\r\n\r\n    The greatest progenitor in Horse History—Mr. Kellogg’s\r\n    description, and comments thereon—An analysis of Hambletonian,\r\n    structurally considered—His carriage and action—As a\r\n    three-year-old trotter—Details of his stud service—Statistics\r\n    of the Hambletonian family—History and ancestry of his dam, the\r\n    Charles Kent Mare—Her grandson, Green’s Bashaw and his dam.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMBLETONIAN, 10.—It has been a matter of constant regret that in\r\nthe compilation of the first volume of the Register I attached the\r\nname “Rysdyk’s” to this horse, and this misstep has served as a kind\r\nof apparent justification for very many men to seize upon the name\r\n“Hambletonian,” with their own name as a prefix. This has led to great\r\nconfusion and annoyance to all that body of men who have anything to do\r\nwith records and correct pedigrees. Fortunately, however, the evil has\r\nbecome so apparent that many writers are beginning to use the numbers,\r\nand we now very frequently hear men speak of “Hambletonian, 10,” as the\r\ntrue designation of this horse.\r\n\r\nAs no horse of any blood or period in this or any other country has\r\nexcited an interest so universal, or represented such a vast sum of money\r\nin his offspring and descendants, I must try to give an account of him\r\nand his family—ancestors and descendants—as full and accurate as the\r\nmaterials at hand will enable me. He was a beautiful bay color, bred by\r\nJonas Seely, of Sugar Loaf, Orange County, New York, foaled 1849, got by\r\nAbdallah; dam the Kent Mare, by imported Bellfounder; grandam One Eye,\r\nby Hambletonian, son of Messenger; great-grandam Silvertail, by imported\r\nMessenger; great-great-grandam Black Jin, breeding unknown. He was sold\r\nwith his dam, when a suckling, to Mr. William M. Rysdyk, of Chester, in\r\nthe same county, and he remained his till he died in March, 1876. He has\r\nbeen described by a great many writers, but the most minute and accurate\r\ndescription I have ever seen is from the pen of “Hark Comstock” (Peter C.\r\nKellogg), which I will here present, and after it note any point upon\r\nwhich my own judgment differs from his. It should be remembered that this\r\ndescription was made when the horse was breaking down with the weight of\r\nyears:\r\n\r\n    Hambletonian, now twenty-six years old, is a rich deep mahogany\r\n    bay, with black legs, the black extending very high up on the\r\n    arms and stifles. His mane was originally black, and in his\r\n    younger days very ornamental; rather light, like that of the\r\n    blood-horse, and of medium length, never reaching below the\r\n    lower line of the neck, but uniform throughout. His foretop\r\n    was always light. At the present time not a vestige of either\r\n    remains, they having gradually disappeared until crest and\r\n    crown are bald. His tail is long and full. When we first knew\r\n    him it was very full, but is also thinning with his advancing\r\n    years. The hair of both was black as a raven’s wing, and\r\n    entirely devoid of wave or curl. His marks are a very small\r\n    star and two white ankles behind, but the coronets being dotted\r\n    with black spots, the hoofs are mainly dark. Muzzle dark. Head\r\n    large and bony, with profile inclining to the Roman order; jowl\r\n    deep; jaws not as wide apart as in some of his descendants, yet\r\n    not deficient. Eye very large and prominent, and countenance\r\n    generally animated and expressive of good temper. We found\r\n    him to measure 10½ inches across the face. Ear large, well\r\n    set, and lively. Neck rather short and a little heavy at the\r\n    throatlatch, but thin and clean at the crest. His shoulders are\r\n    very oblique, deep and strong; withers low and broad; sway very\r\n    short, and coupling smooth. The great fillets of muscle running\r\n    back along the spine give extraordinary width and strength to\r\n    the loin, which threatens to lose the closely-set hip in the\r\n    wealth of its embrace. But it is back of here that we find\r\n    lodged the immense and powerful machinery that, imparted to\r\n    his sons and daughters, has ever placed them in the foremost\r\n    ranks of trotters. His hip is long and croup high, with great\r\n    length from hip-point to hock. Thighs and stifles swelling with\r\n    the sinewy muscle, which extends well down into his large,\r\n    clean, bony hocks, hung near the ground. Below these the leg is\r\n    broad, flat, and clean, with the tendons well detached from the\r\n    bone, and drops at a considerable angle with the upper part of\r\n    the limb, giving the well-bent rather than the straight hock.\r\n    Pasterns long, but strong and elastic, and let into hoofs that\r\n    are perfection. In front his limbs in strength and muscular\r\n    development comport with the rear formation. His chest is broad\r\n    and prominent; his forelegs stand wide apart (perhaps in part\r\n    the result of much covering), and he is deep through the heart;\r\n    yet notwithstanding this, and the fact of his roundness of\r\n    barrel, there is no appearance of heaviness or hampered action.\r\n\r\n    Taken at a glance, the impressive features of the horse are\r\n    his immense substance, without a particle of coarseness or\r\n    grossness. No horse we can recall has so great a volume of\r\n    bone, with the same apparent firmness of texture and true\r\n    blood-like quality. Though short-backed, he is very long\r\n    underneath. Indeed, he is a horse of greater than apparent\r\n    length. We found his measurement from breast to breeching, in\r\n    a straight line, greater by four inches than his height at the\r\n    withers—a very unusual excess. We also found him two inches\r\n    higher over the rump than at the withers, and the whole rear,\r\n    or propelling portion of the machinery, would upon measurement\r\n    seem to have been molded for an animal two sizes larger\r\n    than the one to which it is attached; yet so beautifully\r\n    is its connection effected with the whole that there is no\r\n    disproportion apparent, either in the symmetry or the action\r\n    of the horse. As an evidence of the immense reach which this\r\n    admirable rear construction enables him to obtain, it is often\r\n    noticed by visitors that in his favorite attitude, as he stands\r\n    in his box, his off hind foot is thrown forward so far under\r\n    him as to nearly touch the one in front of it—an attitude which\r\n    few horses of his proportionate length could take without an\r\n    apparent strain, yet which he assumes at perfect repose. When\r\n    led out upon the ground his walk strikes one as being different\r\n    from that of any other horse. It cannot be described further\r\n    than to say that it shows a true and admirable adjustment of\r\n    parts, and a perfect pliability and elasticity of mechanism\r\n    that shows out through every movement. Many have noticed and\r\n    endeavored to account in different ways for the peculiarity,\r\n    some crediting it to the pliable pastern, others to surplus of\r\n    knee and hock action, etc., but the fact is, there seems to be\r\n    a suppleness of the whole conformation that delights to express\r\n    itself in every movement and action of the horse. “In his box,”\r\n    said a Kentucky horseman, who recently looked him over, “I\r\n    thought him too massive to be active, but the moment he stepped\r\n    out I saw that he was all action.”\r\n\r\nThere is so much in the foregoing description that is intelligent and\r\njust that I hardly feel like reviewing a single phrase. In judging of\r\nthe conformation of a horse and determining whether it is good or bad,\r\nat different points, we must have in our mind some ideal standard, by\r\nwhich we mentally compare one thing with another. The popular conception\r\nof the perfect horse is the picture of the “Arabian,” painted by artists\r\nwho never saw an Arabian horse. The next approach to perfection is the\r\nEnglish race horse, but others may insist that the Clydesdale comes\r\nnearer perfection and that he should be the ideal with which the standard\r\nof comparison should be made. It is unfortunate that Mr. Kellogg should\r\nhave described Hambletonian as possessing “immense substance, without a\r\nparticle of coarseness, or grossness.” He had a remarkably coarse head\r\nin its size and outline, but this is greatly softened by saying “with a\r\nprofile inclining to the Roman order.” The ideal muzzle of the English\r\nrace horse is so fine that, figuratively speaking, he can drink out of\r\na tin cup, but Hambletonian could not get his muzzle into a vessel of\r\nmuch smaller dimensions than a half-bushel measure. “Ear large, well set\r\nand lively.” This is true as to the size of the ears, but not correct,\r\nin my judgment, as to the setting on. As they habitually lopped backward\r\nwhen in repose, giving a sour and ill-tempered expression, I could not\r\nconcede that they were “well set.” The hocks were good and clean, but\r\nthe abrupt angle at that point was certainly a coarse feature. The\r\nround meaty withers and the round meaty buttocks were both “coarse and\r\ngross” when looked at from the point of good breeding. His two great,\r\nmeaty ends, connected with a long and perfect barrel, two or three sizes\r\ntoo small for the ends, showed such a marked disproportion that I often\r\nwondered at it. Not one of these criticisms is made in the sense of a\r\ncriticism of Mr. Kellogg’s description, but merely as the expression of\r\na different view on some points, and on those points not mentioned I\r\nmost heartily agree with him. He has omitted to give the height of the\r\nhorse for the reason that he had shrunken from his normal height just one\r\ninch. When at his best he measured fifteen hands one inch and a quarter.\r\nThis shrinkage, in addition to the ordinary results of great age, is\r\nthus explained by Mr. Guy Miller, who knew him better than any other\r\nman except his owner. “His splendid fore hoofs had been ruined by an\r\noperation whereby the arch was lost and the horse during the remainder of\r\nhis days stood on his frogs.” He was two inches higher on the hips than\r\non the withers.\r\n\r\nWhen the horse was led out his movements were so frictionless and\r\nfaultless that he impressed me as the most wonderful horse that I had\r\never seen. He seemed as supple as a cat with the power of an elephant.\r\nAs he walked he kept pushing those crooked hind legs away under him in\r\na manner that gave him a motion peculiarly his own, and suggested the\r\nimmense possibilities of his stride when opened out on a trot. Plain and\r\nindeed homely as he was he was a most interesting and instructive study\r\nwhether in his box or taking his daily walks. The question has been asked\r\na thousand times whether the speed of Hambletonian had been developed\r\nand how fast he could go. This question I considered very important, in\r\na philosophical and breeding sense, and in starting in to investigate\r\nit I found two statements, one that the time made at the Union Course\r\nwas honest and true, and the other that it was a “put up job” to make\r\nMr. Rysdyk feel good, and that the time in fact was much slower than\r\nthat announced. Each side had its advocates, and it did not take long\r\nto discover that the enemies of Mr. Rysdyk were all on one side and the\r\nmore bitter their enmity the more blatant they were in denying the truth\r\nof the time given out for the performance. This party was headed by\r\none “J. M.,” long distinguished, and will be long remembered in Orange\r\nCounty, for the virulence of his dislike to Mr. Rysdyk, and as the most\r\nunreliable of all unreliable horsemen.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1852 Mr. Rysdyk and Mr. Seely C. Roe, the owner of Roe’s\r\nAbdallah Chief, then four years old, concluded to exhibit their sons of\r\nAbdallah at the fair of the American Institute, in New York, and after\r\nthe fair to take their colts, three and four years old respectively, for\r\na light training for a few weeks. The programme was carried out, and\r\nafter reaching the course they started the two colts together, and much\r\nto Mr. Roe’s surprise Hambletonian beat his colt in 3:03. In a short\r\ntime Mr. Roe gave his colt another trial in 2:55½. A few days later Mr.\r\nRysdyk drove his colt in 2:48. Believing then he had the making of the\r\nbest trotter in the world and being thoroughly homesick, he packed up\r\nhis traps and started for Orange County, and this was the first and the\r\nlast training that Hambletonian ever had. When we consider the age of the\r\ncolt and how few of that age had then ever reached that mark, the little\r\nthen known by amateurs of the arts of training and driving, and the very\r\nlimited preparation, we must conclude that this was a remarkably good\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nWas it honestly made? Mr. Roe has been dead a good many years, but the\r\nnext day after he returned from Long Island with Mr. Rysdyk he called at\r\nthe house of his brother-in-law, David R. Feagles, a very responsible\r\nman, and in the course of the conversation he asked Mr. Feagles if he\r\nhad heard the news? “No,” said Mr. Feagles, “what is it?” “Rysdyk’s colt\r\ntrotted the Union Course in 2:48. I held my watch and I know it is true.”\r\nMr. Roe was always steadfast and immovable in this declaration while he\r\nlived. Mr. W. H. Wood, the breeder of Abdallah Chief, says he told him\r\nthe time was 2:48, and he had several times heard it disputed in Mr.\r\nRoe’s presence and he had always settled the dispute by giving the same\r\nfact. Mr. David R. Seely said he could not remember the time made, but he\r\nhad heard the matter disputed, and Mr. Roe settled it by saying it was\r\ntrue, that he saw it and held the watch on him when he did it. These men\r\nwere as reliable as any in Orange County and their statement of Mr. Roe’s\r\nassertions cannot be doubted. Considering the circumstances, it will\r\noccur to any mind that Mr. Roe was the very best witness to the truth of\r\nthis performance that could be produced. He was not only disinterested,\r\nbut in building up the reputation of a rival stallion he was testifying\r\nto his own hurt.\r\n\r\nThere are other evidences of Hambletonian’s development and speed, but\r\nnothing so definite as the foregoing. He was driven in double team\r\nsometimes with the great trotter Sir Walter. Mr. Kinner, at one time\r\nowner of Sir Walter and other good ones, a horseman of experience and\r\nknowledge of trotting affairs, assured me that Sir Walter had shown a\r\ntrial at Centerville track to wagon in 2:32, and this was before he was\r\ndriven double, occasionally, with Hambletonian; and that Hambletonian\r\ncould out-foot Sir Walter for the first half-mile, but as the young horse\r\nwas green and unseasoned, he could not keep up the clip to the finish. He\r\ndid not hesitate to express the belief that the team could have trotted\r\nthe mile in considerably less than 2:40. There is one fact in connection\r\nwith the trial at Union Course that I have omitted in its proper place.\r\nMr. Rysdyk was a remarkably careful man and always aimed to be inside of\r\nthe truth rather than beyond it. He advertised his horse as having made\r\nthe trial in 2:48½, as it is probable some of the watches gave that as\r\nthe time, instead of 2:48 flat.\r\n\r\nLike all the Abdallah family, Hambletonian matured early, and at three\r\nyears was as well advanced as many colts a year older. His stud services\r\ncommenced early. When two years old he was allowed to cover four mares\r\nwithout fee and he got three colts, one of which was afterward known as\r\nthe famous Alexander’s Abdallah. When three years old he was offered\r\nfor public patronage at twenty-five dollars to insure, and he covered\r\nseventeen mares and got thirteen colts. The next season, at the same\r\nprice, he covered one hundred and one mares and got seventy-eight\r\ncolts. The next season (1854), being then five years old, the price was\r\nadvanced to thirty-five dollars, and he covered eighty-eight mares,\r\ngetting sixty-three foals. The price remained at thirty-five dollars\r\ntill 1863, when it was advanced to seventy-five dollars. At which price\r\nhe covered one hundred and fifty mares. The next season the price was\r\nadvanced to one hundred dollars, and he covered two hundred and seventeen\r\nmares, getting one hundred and forty-eight foals. In 1865 the price\r\nwas advanced to three hundred dollars and one hundred and ninety-three\r\nmares were covered. In 1866 the price was put at five hundred dollars\r\nand one hundred and five mares were covered. At this price his services\r\nremained ever afterward—one hundred dollars down and the remainder when\r\nthe mare proved in foal. In 1867 he covered seventy-seven mares and got\r\nonly forty-one foals. This large percentage of failure indicated beyond\r\nquestion that his procreative powers had been overtaxed and that there\r\nwas a general letting down of his vital energies. In 1868 he was not\r\nallowed to cover any mares. In 1869 he again manifested his usual vigor\r\nand he covered twenty-one mares, getting fourteen foals. In 1870 he\r\ncovered twenty-two mares and got thirteen foals. From this time forward\r\nhis procreative powers dwindled, and in 1875, I think, he got but two\r\nfoals, and died the following March.\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that he got about one thousand three hundred\r\nfoals, and for several years it was one of the amusing features of horse\r\nliterature to see how many writers were able to demonstrate that as a\r\nprogenitor of speed he was a failure. This item of one thousand three\r\nhundred foals was taken as the basis of computation, and then with the\r\nsmall number of forty trotters out of the one thousand three hundred,\r\nthe percentage of trotters was very small. The next step was to find\r\nsome unknown horse, generally a pacer, that had only two or three foals\r\nto his credit and one of them had made a record of 2:30, thus showing\r\na much larger percentage than Hambletonian, and by that much he was a\r\ngreater sire than Hambletonian. All this foolishness has now subsided in\r\nthe face of the fact that the great mass of the trotters of today have\r\nmore or less of his blood in their veins, and in a very short time that\r\nblood will abound in greater or less strength in every American trotter.\r\nThe tables which here follows will make this fact evident to all who will\r\nstudy them.\r\n\r\n    [Prefatory to these tables and to the other statistics\r\n    concerning the present rank of the trotting families given\r\n    in the pages following, an explanatory paragraph is in order\r\n    so that they may not be misunderstood. (1) They are based\r\n    on the tables given in the Year Book for 1896, and I regret\r\n    to say that these tables are so emasculated, incomplete,\r\n    unsatisfactory and in many cases contradictory one of the other\r\n    that it is literally impossible to compile from them statistics\r\n    that may be accepted as absolutely correct and letter perfect.\r\n    However, as this work is not intended as one for statistical\r\n    reference, the tables being approximately correct serve\r\n    my purpose, which is merely to show _relatively_ and with\r\n    substantial accuracy the standing of the sires and families\r\n    embraced to the close of 1896. (2) By the term “standard\r\n    performers” is meant horses that have acquired trotting records\r\n    of 2:30 or better, or pacing records of 2:25 or better. The\r\n    Year Book no longer gives a 2:30 pacing list, and it should\r\n    be noted that pacers with records between 2:30 and 2:25 are\r\n    not credited in these tables. (3) The tables are designed to\r\n    show (_a_) the number of standard performers got by each sire\r\n    named. (_b_) The number of his sons that are sires of standard\r\n    performers. (_c_) The number of his daughters that are dams of\r\n    standard performers.

Her son was long and round, just the opposite of\r\nher sire. Hips rather coarse, and might be considered a little ragged.\r\nStifles very powerful and well-developed. Her hocks and legs were exactly\r\nrepresented in her son Hambletonian. Her neck was fine and bloodlike, but\r\nnot long. Her head was good, and her eyes remarkably full and bright,\r\nshowing considerable white. Her mane was long, but thin, and her tail\r\nwas light. Her shoulders were well-sloped, her withers ran up high, and\r\nwere thin. Jonas Seely, Sr., having given the old mare One Eye to his son\r\nCharles, she was sold to Josiah S. Jackson, of Oxford, Orange County.\r\nMr. Jackson bred her to Bellfounder and the produce was the Kent mare.\r\nAlthough the Seely family owned the stock, originally and afterward, Mr.\r\nJackson was really the breeder of this mare. Mr. Jonas Seely says she was\r\ngot the year Bellfounder stood at Poughkeepsie (1831), but Mr. Rysdyk\r\nsays she was got in 1832, when Bellfounder stood at Washingtonville. Mr.\r\nJackson sold her at three years old to Peter Seely for three hundred\r\ndollars; Mr. Seely sold her soon after to Mr. Pray, of New York, for four\r\nhundred dollars; Mr. Pray sold her to William Chivis for five hundred\r\ndollars; and Mr. Chivis sold her to a gentleman, who was a banker in New\r\nYork—name not remembered—to match another as a fast road team. This team\r\nran away after a time, and she was injured, and became lame. Charles\r\nKent, a butcher in New York, then bought her and bred her to Webber’s Tom\r\nThumb, before he came to Orange County. At this juncture, on the earnest\r\nrecommendation of Mr. Pray, who had tested the quality of three or four\r\nof the family, Mr. Jonas Seely—Jonas, second—bought the mare of Kent for\r\none hundred and thirty-five dollars, and took her back to the old place,\r\nwhere she was bred and produced as follows:\r\n\r\n  1843. Brown filly Belle, by Webber’s Tom Thumb.\r\n  1845. Black gelding, by Webber’s Tom Thumb.\r\n  1846. Chestnut filly (died at 4 years old), by Abdallah.\r\n  1848. Brown filly (died at 4 years old), by Abdallah.\r\n  1849. Bay colt Hambletonian, by Abdallah (mare and colt sold to\r\n          William M. Rysdyk, for $125).\r\n  1850. Brown filly (went to Maryland), by Young Patriot.\r\n  1851. Lost foal, by L. I. Black Hawk.\r\n  1852. Brown colt Tippoo Saib, by Brook’s Black Hawk.\r\n  1853. Chestnut colt (died young), by Fiddler.\r\n  1856. Brown gelding, by Plato.\r\n  1859. Bay colt, by Almack, son of Hambletonian.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding list there are but two fillies that lived to produce\r\nanything, and one of them is lost from sight. The produce of the first\r\nwill be given below. The Patriot filly that went to Maryland was a brown,\r\nand of good size, but nothing further is known of her.\r\n\r\nThe Tom Thumb gelding of 1845 was in 1869 a good road horse, and was\r\nowned by George S. Conklin. He was showy and stylish without very much\r\nspeed. Her fifth foal, Hambletonian, is known wherever the trotting horse\r\nis known.\r\n\r\nThis mare was a trotter of no ordinary merit. She was never in any races,\r\nso far as known, except they might have been of a private nature, but\r\nafter she passed into the hands of Peter Seely her speed was pretty well\r\ndeveloped. This is not only shown by the advance in her price from owner\r\nto owner, but it appears to be a well-established fact that when four\r\nyears old Peter Seely had her at the Union Course, and he there gave\r\nher two trials to saddle, the first in 2:43 and the second in 2:41. For\r\na time I was skeptical about these trials, but they seem to be beyond\r\nquestion. This is considerably faster than any other of the get of\r\nimported Bellfounder ever trotted in this country, and from this we may\r\nconclude that her inheritance from her dam was the great factor in her\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nONE EYE, the dam of the Kent mare, was a brown, about fifteen hands and\r\nan inch high, with two white feet and perhaps a little white in her\r\nface. With the taste Mr. Seely had of the Messenger blood in Silvertail\r\nhe wanted more of it; and when Townsend Cock sent the famous Bishop’s\r\nHambletonian to Goshen in 1814, Mr. Seely bred his daughter of Messenger\r\nto this son of Messenger and the produce was One Eye. I do not learn\r\nthat this mare was handsome, but she was an animal of most remarkable\r\ncourage and endurance. The load was never too heavy nor the road too\r\nlong. Withal, she had a will of her own and was a little hard to manage\r\nunless she was worked constantly. One day when on her mettle she got an\r\neye knocked out by accident, and, hence, her name; but the great quality\r\nof this mare was her remarkable trotting action. Those familiar with her\r\ngait, and entirely competent to judge, are enthusiastic in the opinion\r\nthat no trotter of the present day ever surpassed, her in a grand open\r\ntrotting step. If the patience and skill brought into use in developing\r\nthe modern trotter had been expended on her, she doubtless would have\r\nsurpassed all of her day, not even excepting her near relation, old\r\nTopgallant. This mare illustrates a point of very great importance. She\r\nwas got by a son of Messenger that was a running horse of merit and\r\nable to beat some of the best of his day, and her dam was a daughter of\r\nMessenger. The trotting action of neither sire nor dam had ever been\r\ndeveloped, but when these two Messengers came together, the clean, open,\r\nunmistakable trotting gait was the result. Right at this point and in\r\nthis mare, One Eye, we have the incipient cause of all Hambletonian’s\r\ngreatness. This mare was bred by Jonas Seely, Sr.; given to his son\r\nCharles, who sold her to his brother-in-law, Josiah Jackson, of Oxford in\r\nOrange County. According the recollection of Mr. Rysdyk, who was entirely\r\nfamiliar with the Seely family and their affairs, she produced as follows:\r\n\r\n  1829. Bay gelding Crabstick, by Seagull.\r\n  1830. Bay gelding Pray Colt, by Seagull.\r\n  1831. Bay filly Young One Eye, by Edmund Seely’s horse Orphan Boy.\r\n  1833. Bay filly Kent Mare, by imp. Bellfounder. Sold to Mr. Pray.\r\n  1834. Bay filly; sold also to Mr. Pray, by imp. Bellfounder.\r\n          Perhaps there was another foal that died.\r\n\r\nThe first of her foals, Crabstick, appears to have been well-named.\r\nHis temper was anything but smooth and pleasant. He was sold early\r\nto Mr. Ebenezer Pray, of New York, and he soon evinced two traits of\r\ncharacter that did not elevate him in the estimation of his owner. He\r\nwould throw every one off that dared to mount him, and when they did get\r\nhim under motion he was determined to pace and not trot. On a certain\r\noccasion Mr. Rysdyk visited Mr. Pray, and he was urged to try his skill\r\nin riding Crabstick and see if he could make him trot. The attempt was\r\nlong-continued, and embraced up hill, down hill, and level work, but\r\nall to no purpose, as pace he would. At last Mr. Pray proposed to put\r\nhim over rails and stakes, placed on the road at intervals of a good\r\ntrotting stride, and see if that would make him quit moving one side\r\nat a time. Mr. Rysdyk went up the road and got under good headway, but\r\njust before he reached the rails the horse threw him. He was not much\r\nhurt, mounted again, and then commenced in earnest the fight for the\r\nmastery between the horse and his rider. The value of a neck was nothing\r\nwhen compared with the great question of who should conquer. The next\r\nattempt was successful, and he went over the rails flying. The intervals\r\nbetween them were then extended, and he was kept at that most dangerous\r\nexercise till he would trot without rails, and until both horse and rider\r\nwere completely exhausted. The horse was conquered, and although always\r\nwillful and hard to manage, ever after, when called on to trot, he would\r\ndo it. Mr. Pray sold him to Mr. Vanderbilt, and, although kept as a\r\nprivate driving horse, he was fast for his day, and could go in less than\r\nthree minutes at any time.\r\n\r\nHer next foal was sold also to Mr. Pray when five years old, and was\r\nknown as the Pray Colt. He was marked just as his brother Crabstick, and,\r\nlike him, was somewhat vicious and hard to manage.\r\n\r\nThe third foal, Young One Eye, was by Edmund Seely’s horse Orphan Boy,\r\nwhose pedigree is not now known. One of her eyes was knocked out by Peter\r\nSeely, accidentally, when breaking her, just as her dam had lost an\r\neye. She passed out of the hands of the Seely family and her subsequent\r\nhistory is unknown. If this mare ever produced anything, her history and\r\nthat of her descendants would be of great interest and value.\r\n\r\nThe question at once suggests itself, Where did Crabstick get his pacing\r\naction? It could not have been from his sire, as he was a son of Duroc,\r\nso said, but it may have come from Seagull’s dam, as we know nothing\r\nof her breeding; or it may have come from old Black Jin, the dam of\r\nSilvertail. If from neither of these we must then conclude it came\r\nfrom Messenger himself, or rather, through him from some of his pacing\r\nancestors. It is altogether probable that the strong infusion of pacing\r\nblood in Messenger’s veins was the real element that made him a trotting\r\nprogenitor when every other imported English horse failed in that respect.\r\n\r\nSilvertail, the great-grandam of Hambletonian, was a dark brown mare\r\nwith white hind feet and a white face. She had a great many white hairs\r\nin her tail and hence she was called Silvertail. She was foaled in 1802\r\nand was bred by Mr. Jonas Seely, Sr., of Sugar Loaf, Orange County, New\r\nYork. She was got by imported Messenger in 1801, the year he stood at\r\nGoshen, New York. Her dam was a great, slashing black mare called “Jin”\r\nthat Mr. Seely had used in his business many years, but her origin and\r\nbreeding cannot now be found. She must have been a real good one or Mr.\r\nSeely would not have taken her to Messenger. In the summer of 1806, as\r\nwas his custom, he was down at New York with a drove of cattle, and his\r\nson Jonas, then a lad of eight or ten years old, went along to help\r\ndrive the cattle and to see the city. He was detained two or three days\r\nlonger than he expected and it was very important that he should reach\r\nhome at a certain time. On the morning of that day he found himself in\r\nHoboken, with his son, and no means of getting home except on Silvertail.\r\nSo he took the boy up behind him and went home that day, seventy-five\r\nmiles, by sundown. She was fully sixteen hands high and of very fine\r\nstyle. Her head, neck and ear were bloodlike, and her resolution and will\r\nwere remarkable even in old age. Her step, at the trot, is not known to\r\nhave been much developed, but she could gallop all day long. On several\r\noccasions she carried her master to Albany in a day. Besides the famous\r\nOne Eye she produced several superior foals that brought high prices, in\r\nthose days, but we have only the one line tracing to her as a producer.\r\nShe died the property of Ebenezer Seely.\r\n\r\nIn searching for the particulars of this pedigree of Hambletonian and\r\nin tracing it back to old “Black Jin,” I was necessarily brought into\r\ncontact with a great many people, some of whom were helpful and some were\r\nnot. As a matter of course I met with the usual number who professed to\r\n“know it all,” but really knew nothing that was reliable. As the whole\r\ntracing was in the Seely family, the public may wish to know what kind\r\nof people they were. Jonas Seely, first, of Oxford in Orange County, was\r\na large farmer in the last century and an extensive cattle feeder and\r\ndrover. As there were no railroads or steam boats in those days, much\r\nof his time was given to driving cattle, either in collecting them from\r\nthe interior or in taking them to market in New York. He had use for\r\ngood horses and he had a fancy for the best. His business brought him\r\ninto contact with the butchers of New York, and we find he sold many of\r\nhis horses as well as his cattle to them. These same business relations\r\nwere continued under his successor. He left a large family of sons who\r\nseemed to take to the horse as a duck takes to water. Jonas, second, was\r\none of his younger sons and succeeded to his father’s business as well\r\nas to the homestead. He was born 1797 at Oxford, and his father removed\r\nto the farm at Sugar Loaf when he was a child. He was a thrifty and\r\nsuccessful farmer. For a number of years he was engaged with his partner\r\nand lifelong friend, Ebenezer Pray, in buying and driving cattle from\r\nthe West to the New York market. In June, 1882, he passed away and there\r\nended an acquaintance and a friendship of nearly thirty years. He was a\r\nstrictly conscientious and truthful man, and died in the glorious hope of\r\na devoted Christian. His first visit to New York, in 1806, the wonders\r\nhe saw there, and especially the total eclipse that occurred while he\r\nwas there, and how he watched it from the Bull’s Head tavern, through a\r\npiece of smoked glass, and the ride home the next day behind his father\r\non Silvertail, and how he ran down many a hill to rest himself, and how\r\ntired he was when they reached home, are incidents that were all detailed\r\nto me with the interest and vigor of yesterday.\r\n\r\nWhen One Eye was about fifteen years old the elder Jonas gave her or\r\nsold her to his son-in-law, Josiah Jackson, and in due time he bred her\r\nto imported Bellfounder and she produced the Charles Kent mare. Mr.\r\nRysdyk thought the elder Jonas gave this mare to his son Charles and\r\nthat Charles sold her to Mr. Jackson, which is not material. After the\r\nKent mare had been battered about in New York for some years and finally\r\ncrippled, Charles Kent, a butcher, bought her and bred her to Webber’s\r\nTom Thumb, a Canadian horse that was quite a trotter. On one occasion\r\nwhen Jonas II. and Mr. Pray were down in the city, Kent wanted to sell\r\nthe mare, and Mr. Pray urged Jonas very strongly to buy her and take her\r\nhome for a brood mare. He concluded to do so if she were not too badly\r\ncrippled, and they together went over on to the island to see her, when\r\nshe came again into the Seely family. In 1848 he bred her to Abdallah, in\r\n1849 she produced a bay colt, and in the autumn of that year he sold her\r\nwith her colt to William M. Rysdyk, who had been employed on his farm for\r\nthe year, for one hundred and twenty-five dollars, and this colt proved\r\nto be the great Hambletonian.\r\n\r\nAs it is now conceded, not only in this country, but throughout the\r\nworld, that Hambletonian, as a trotting progenitor, is far and away the\r\ngreatest horse that has ever been produced, a careful and true analysis\r\nof the blood elements entering into his inheritance is a most interesting\r\nand instructive lesson for all breeders. First we have the direct cross\r\nfrom Messenger himself in Silvertail; second, we have the cross from a\r\nson of Messenger on a daughter of Messenger in One Eye, making her equal\r\nto a daughter of Messenger in blood; third, we have the out-cross from\r\nBellfounder, that was a total failure as a trotting progenitor, on this\r\ndouble granddaughter of Messenger, and the result is a trotter in the\r\nKent mare and practically the only trotter that Bellfounder ever got;\r\nfourth, we have the cross of a grandson and probably a double grandson\r\nof Messenger on this trotter, and the produce is Hambletonian himself.\r\nThese crosses show a stronger concentration of Messenger blood than can\r\nbe found in any horse of his generation.\r\n\r\nBASHAW (GREEN’S).—This was a black horse, fifteen and a half hands high,\r\nbred by Jonas Seely, the breeder of Hambletonian; foaled 1855, and\r\ngiven when following his dam to his son-in-law, Colonel F. M. Cummins,\r\nof Muscatine, Iowa. He was got by Vernol’s Black Hawk, then known as\r\nthe Drake colt, son of Long Island Black Hawk, and his dam was Belle,\r\nthe first foal of the Charles Kent mare, that was out of One Eye. In\r\nthe spring of 1857 he was sold to Joseph A. Green, of Muscatine, and he\r\nremained his till 1864. He had one white hind foot and a large, full\r\nstar in his forehead. He was a smooth, handsome horse in every respect.\r\nHis head, neck, ear and eye were all good, and free from coarseness.\r\nHis back and loin had very few equals even among those that are called\r\nmost perfect at these points. His hip was of great length, and in\r\nhis buttock there was quite a resemblance on a reduced scale to his\r\nkinsman, Hambletonian. His limbs and feet both in shape and quality were\r\nadmirable, and his disposition docile and kindly. In walking his gait\r\nwas slinging, but loose jointed and slovenly, and he was therefore not a\r\npleasant driving horse. But at the trot, whether going slow or fast, his\r\nstyle was very taking and his action remarkably perfect. While owned by\r\nMr. Green he was handled by good, careful men, but they had no experience\r\nin developing and driving a trotter, and knew nothing about that kind\r\nof horsemanship. Under these circumstances many a horse would have been\r\nspoiled, but his gait was always perfect and his popularity as a trotter\r\nnever waned. He never was started in what might be called regular races,\r\nbut at State fairs and the principal county fairs he was always in\r\ndemand and always won. He was, perhaps, the best natural trotter that\r\nI have ever seen. He was able to show about 2:28, but I think he never\r\nwon a heat on a half-mile track in better than 2:31, and when sixteen\r\nyears old he was able to win in 2:35. In 1864 Mr. Green sold him to some\r\nparties in St. Louis, Missouri, and they to Mr. Beckwith of Hartford,\r\nConnecticut, and while in his hands he was matched against Young Morrill,\r\nbut went amiss and paid forfeit. He made the season of 1865 at Hartford.\r\nThe following winter Mr. Green repurchased him and he was returned to\r\nMuscatine, where he remained till January, 1877, when he was sold to\r\nGeorge A. Young, of Leland, Illinois, and died January, 1880.\r\n\r\nHe left seventeen trotters in the 2:30 list; twenty-four sons that were\r\nthe sires of fifty-nine standard performers, and thirty-four daughters\r\nthat produced forty-four standard performers. As his sire never amounted\r\nto anything either as a trotter or a getter of trotters, it is fair to\r\nconclude that whatever merit he possessed was inherited from the same\r\nsource that made Hambletonian greater than all others.\r\n\r\nBELLE, the dam of Bashaw, 50, was a brown mare about fifteen and\r\nthree-quarter hands high, with tan muzzle and flanks and some white feet.\r\nShe was rather short in the body and neck, but she was very stoutly built\r\nand had been a fine road mare. She was bred by Charles Kent, the butcher,\r\nand I think was following her dam when Mr. Jonas Seely bought her. She\r\nwas foaled 1843 and was got by Tom Thumb, a Canadian horse, and a trotter\r\nthat was brought into Orange County by William Webber and left excellent\r\nstock. Her dam was the Charles Kent mare, the dam of Hambletonian. She\r\nproduced as follows:\r\n\r\n  1848. Bay gelding, by Abdallah.\r\n  1849. Bay filly Seely Abdallah, by Abdallah.\r\n  1851. Black colt Seely’s Black Hawk, by Long Island Black Hawk.\r\n  1853. Bay filly, (taken West) by Hambletonian.\r\n  1855. Black colt Green’s Bashaw, by Vernol’s Black Hawk.\r\n  1857. Bay filly by Black Hawk Prophet, son of Vermont Black Hawk,\r\n          in Iowa. This filly was ringboned, and given away.\r\n\r\nNothing is now known of the gelding by Abdallah. The filly of 1849 by\r\nAbdallah, called Seely Abdallah, was owned by Mr. Charles Backman, and he\r\nhad her produce for two or three generations.\r\n\r\nThe black colt by Long Island Black Hawk of 1851 was sold to Ebenezer\r\nSeely, and kept as a stallion. This Mr. Seely died in Chemung County,\r\nand the horse died there in the spring of 1859. The filly of 1853 by\r\nHambletonian was one of a pair of Hambletonian fillies bought and taken\r\nto Iowa by Mr. Green in 1855. They developed a very fine rate of speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nHAMBLETONIAN’S SONS AND GRANDSONS.\r\n\r\n    Different opinions as to relative merits of\r\n    Hambletonian’s greater sons—George Wilkes, his history\r\n    and pedigree—His performing descendants—History and\r\n    description of Electioneer—His family—Alexander’s\r\n    Abdallah and his two greatest sons, Almont and\r\n    Belmont—Dictator—Harold—Happy Medium and his dam—Jay\r\n    Gould—Strathmore—Egbert—Aberdeen—Masterlode—Sweepstakes—Governor\r\n    Sprague, grandson of Hambletonian.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a prominent sire by Hambletonian that has not been\r\nclaimed by his admirers to have been the “greatest son” of the most\r\nrenowned of trotting progenitors, and if a poll of the horsemen of the\r\ncountry could be taken to-day as to what horse was the greatest son of\r\nHambletonian, probably a dozen names would be found to have thousands\r\nof supporters each. As with all questions that are largely matters of\r\nopinion, and that cannot be decided absolutely by figures, the relative\r\nrank of horses as progenitors must always remain open to disputation\r\naccording as thinkers approach the subject from different points of view\r\nand of interest. I shall not enter into any discussion as to the relative\r\nmerits of the great sons of Hambletonian with a purpose to reach any\r\ndeduction as to which was or is the greatest; but shall refer the reader\r\nto the table given in the preceding chapter, and content myself with\r\nbriefly giving the history of the more renowned sires of the Hambletonian\r\nline, with such statistics as may be necessary to gauge their rank as\r\nprogenitors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE WILKES.\r\n\r\nA Great Son of Hambletonian.]\r\n\r\nGEORGE WILKES was one of the first of Hambletonian’s sons to attract\r\nattention, by his performances on the turf, to the value of his sire;\r\nand as a progenitor he must be accorded a place in the first rank of all\r\ntrotting sires. This horse was bred by Colonel Harry Felter, Newburgh,\r\nNew York, was foaled 1856, and was got by Hambletonian out of the fast\r\nroad mare Dolly Spanker. (This mare was afterward registered on what\r\nseemed excellent evidence as by Henry Clay, out of a daughter of Baker’s\r\nHighlander, but more recent investigation has thrown serious doubt upon\r\nthis pedigree, the subject being fully discussed in the chapters in\r\nthis work on “The Investigation of Pedigrees.”) After the travail that\r\nbrought the little brown colt into the world, Dolly Spanker died, and\r\nthe orphaned youngster, like Andrew Jackson, owed his life to woman’s\r\nkindly care. He was fed by the women of the farm on Jamaica rum and\r\nmilk sweetened with sugar, and soon grew lusty, though he was always an\r\nundersized horse, never much, if any, exceeding fifteen hands in height,\r\nthough he was so stoutly and compactly made that he gave the impression\r\nof being larger than he really was. He was of that order that has been\r\nparadoxically described as “a big little horse.” In color he was a very\r\ndark brown, and his flanks and muzzle shaded into a deep tan, or wine\r\ncolor. From a detailed description of him published in the _Spirit of the\r\nTimes_ in 1862, I extract the following:\r\n\r\n    “He is about 15.1, but all horse.... His traveling gear is just\r\n    what it should be—muscular shoulders long strong arms, flat\r\n    legs, splendid quarters, great length from hip to hock, and\r\n    very fine back sinews. He stands higher behind than he does\r\n    forward, a formation we like.... He is very wide between the\r\n    jaws.... His coat is fine and glows like the rich dark tints of\r\n    polished rosewood.... His temper is kind. We had the pleasure\r\n    of seeing him at his work, and unless we are greatly mistaken\r\n    he will make an amazingly good one. He has a long and easy way\r\n    of going, striking well out behind and tucking his haunches\r\n    well under him.”\r\n\r\nThough from the fact that this writer stated that Wilkes “was as handsome\r\nas Ethan Allen,” we might suspect him of a tendency to “paint the lily,”\r\nit will be noted that this was written before the horse had any great\r\nreputation to speak of, and it may be accepted as a substantially correct\r\ndescription as far as it goes. In describing his action Charles J. Foster\r\nwrote that “his hind leg when straightened out in action as he went at\r\nhis best pace reminded me of that of a duck swimming.” He was then the\r\nproperty of Z. E. Simmons, who had purchased him as a three-year-old for\r\n$3,000, and another horse.\r\n\r\nGeorge Wilkes, or Robert Fillingham, as he was first named, was a trotter\r\nfrom colthood. At four years old he was matched against Guy Miller, but\r\nhis party paid forfeit, the reason therefor being afterward alleged\r\nthat they found Fillingham possessed of so much speed that they decided\r\nto “lay for bigger game.” The late Alden Goldsmith, a most competent\r\njudge, saw the colt trot at this time and then thought he was the fastest\r\nhorse he had ever seen. He won a race in August of his five-year-old\r\nyear, taking a record of 2:33, and the next year sprang into wide fame\r\nby defeating the then popular idol, Ethan Allen, in straight heats, over\r\nthe Union Course, the fastest heat being in 2:24¾. In October of that\r\nyear he started in harness against General Butler, under saddle. Though\r\nButler was no match for George Wilkes in harness, with a saddle on his\r\nback, and Dan Mace in the saddle, he was almost unbeatable in his day,\r\nbut it took him four heats to beat Wilkes, who forced him out in the\r\nfirst heat in 2:21½, a record he never after surpassed. Then William L.\r\nSimmons and John Morrissey matched Wilkes against Butler, two-mile heats\r\nto wagon, the latter having previously beaten the great George M. Patchen\r\na heat in record-breaking time under similar conditions. In preparation\r\nfor that match George Wilkes was sent a trial over the Centerville\r\nCourse, concerning which there has been much discussion and probably much\r\nromance. Charles J. Foster wrote thus:\r\n\r\n    “It was a close, sultry day and the stallion was short of\r\n    work.... He went the two-mile trial and I have no doubt it was\r\n    faster than trotter ever had before, or has since, in any rig.\r\n    But it ‘cooked his mutton,’ as the saying is, and for a long\r\n    time he was George Wilkes no more.”\r\n\r\nIt is said that ever after this trial, whatever it may have been, George\r\nWilkes was inclined to sulk in his races. He raced with fair success\r\nin 1863 and 1864, and at the beginning of 1865 was classed among the\r\nvery best out. He was sent against Dexter and Lady Thorn, being beaten\r\nby both; but in 1866 he twice defeated Lady Thorn, the last time in a\r\nnotable wagon race over Union Course in 2:27, 2:25, 2:26¾. Afterward\r\nin the same year Lady Thorn defeated Wilkes in four successive races,\r\nand she beat him again in their only meeting the following year, but in\r\n1868 he defeated the mare in a hard-fought race, she winning the first\r\nand second heats and making the fourth heat dead. George Wilkes made\r\nhis record of 2:22, October 13, 1868, over the Narragansett Course at\r\nProvidence in a winning race with Rhode Island and Draco. He was kept on\r\nthe turf with indifferent success until 1872, racing frequently against\r\nLucy, Lady Thorn, and American Girl, all of whom outclassed him, at least\r\nin the afternoon of his racing career. Just how fast a trotter George\r\nWilkes was it is impossible definitely to determine, so many and varying\r\nhave been the representations on that point. It has been claimed that\r\nhe went a quarter in twenty-nine seconds to an eighty-five pound wagon.\r\nWilliam L. Simmons some years ago stated that of his own knowledge George\r\nWilkes trotted a mile and repeat as a six-year-old at the Centerville\r\nCourse in 2:19¼, 2:18½, and that Sam McLaughlin drove him a half-mile to\r\nwagon over Union Course in 1:04½. These statements I give for what may\r\nbe deemed their worth, contenting myself with the remark that it is safe\r\nto conclude that George Wilkes would have trotted well within the 2:20\r\nmark, if he had been managed with a view to bringing out his highest\r\nracing capacity, instead of being handled solely for the purpose of smart\r\nbetting and match-making manipulations.\r\n\r\nGeorge Wilkes was taken to Lexington, Kentucky, by William L. Simmons,\r\nhis owner, in 1873, and in his declining years made a reputation so great\r\nin the stud that his brilliant turf career is almost forgotten. After\r\nhaving trotted against the best in the country for twelve successive\r\nyears, proving his fitness in the fiery ordeal of turf contest, he, in\r\nthe nine remaining years of his life, fulfilled the purpose of his being,\r\nand demonstrated the truth of heredity by getting trotters in plenty able\r\nto do and outdo what he had in his day done.\r\n\r\nGeorge Wilkes got a few foals before going to Kentucky, of which the most\r\nnotable was May Bird, 2:21, the first trotter to bring him reputation\r\nas a sire. Of the others got in the North, Young Wilkes, 2:28¼, a sire\r\nof some reputation, and Wilkes Spirit, who also figures in the table of\r\nsires, are the only ones to earn places in the records. Early in the\r\neighties George Wilkes began to assume high rank as a sire, May Bird,\r\nKentucky Wilkes, Prospect Maid, So So, Joe Bunker and others bringing\r\nhim into prominence. Every year added to his roll of honor and soon\r\nhe was among the leaders. Blue Bull had surpassed Hambletonian in the\r\nnumber of trotters to his credit in the 2:30 list, but at the close of\r\n1886 George Wilkes was even with the Indiana sire, in 1887 he passed\r\nhim, and for some seasons led all sires of 2:30 performers. George\r\nWilkes got seventy-two trotters and eleven pacers to acquire standard\r\nrecords, of which the most noted were Harry Wilkes, 2:13½, Guy Wilkes,\r\n2:15¼, and Wilson, 2:16¼; and ninety-four of his sons and eighty-one of\r\nhis daughters have produced, as shown in the table of Hambletonian’s\r\nsons, 1801 standard performers. The following table embraces the sons\r\nof George Wilkes that have twenty or more standard performers to their\r\ncredit:\r\n\r\nLEADING SONS OF GEORGE WILKES.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                              Total No. produced in two generations.\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n         Standard performers produced by sons and daughters. |\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------+      |\r\n                                 Producing daughters. |      |\r\n  ----------------------------------------------+     |      |\r\n                                Producing sons. |     |      |\r\n  ----------------------------------------+     |     |      |\r\n                     Standard performers. |     |     |      |\r\n  ----------------------------------+     |     |     |      |\r\n                       Year foaled. |     |     |     |      |\r\n  ---------------------------+      |     |     |     |      |\r\n           Name.             |      |     |     |     |      |\r\n  ---------------------------+------+-----+-----+-----+------+------\r\n  Red Wilkes, 2:40           | 1874 | 127 |  62 |  41 |  267 |  394\r\n  Onward, 2:25¼              | 1875 | 120 |  64 |  32 |  275 |  395\r\n  Alcantara, 2:23            | 1876 |  98 |  29 |  15 |  115 |  213\r\n  Bourbon Wilkes             | 1875 |  67 |  14 |  12 |   45 |  112\r\n  Simmons, 2:28              | 1879 |  64 |  13 |   6 |   35 |   99\r\n  Wilton, 2:19¼              | 1880 |  61 |   3 |   4 |    8 |   69\r\n  Jay Bird, 2:31¾            | 1878 |  57 |  10 |  10 |   68 |  125\r\n  Alcyone, 2:27              | 1877 |  55 |  27 |   9 |  117 |  172\r\n  Guy Wilkes, 2:15¼          | 1879 |  52 |  10 |   5 |   49 |  101\r\n  Ambassador, 2:21¼          | 1875 |  48 |   8 |   3 |   33 |   81\r\n  Gambetta Wilkes, 2:26      | 1881 |  48 |  11 |   6 |   32 |   80\r\n  Baron Wilkes, 2:18         | 1882 |  47 |   6 |   7 |   18 |   65\r\n  Adrian Wilkes              | 1878 |  38 |   6 |   7 |   25 |   63\r\n  Wilkes Boy, 2:24½          | 1880 |  37 |   2 |   3 |    8 |   45\r\n  Young Jim                  | 1874 |  37 |  11 |  19 |   43 |   80\r\n  Brown Wilkes, 2:21¾        | 1876 |  32 |   5 |   1 |   39 |   71\r\n  Young Wilkes, 2:28¼        | 1868 |  29 |   6 |   3 |   12 |   41\r\n  Favorite Wilkes, 2:24½     | 1877 |  23 |   7 |   6 |   21 |   44\r\n  Woodford Wilkes            | 1882 |  23 |   1 |   4 |   12 |   35\r\n  Wilkie Collins             | 1876 |  21 |   5 |   1 |   10 |   31\r\n  Lumps, 2:21                | 1875 |  20 |   3 |  10 |   16 |   36\r\n  The King, 2:29¼            | 1874 |  20 |  —— |  —— |   —— |   20\r\n  Jersey Wilkes              | 1881 |  20 |  —— |   2 |    2 |   22\r\n  ---------------------------+------+-----+-----+-----+------+------\r\n\r\nAmong the other seventy-one producing sons of George Wilkes: that do\r\nnot come within the scope of this table are many most promising sires\r\nof rapidly growing prominence, and indeed this family is branching out\r\nwonderfully in every direction. This family is an emphatically improving\r\none. In extreme speed, in racing capacity, and in form the third Wilkes\r\ngeneration is better than either the second or first. Of trotters, such\r\nas Beuzetta, 2:06¾, Ralph Wilkes, 2:06¾, Hulda, 2:08½, Allerton, 2:09¼,\r\nthe once sensational Axtell, 2:12, and many others of the first rank\r\nby sons of George Wilkes sustain this judgment. The pacing instinct is\r\nrampant in the Wilkes blood, as is attested by the fact that twenty-five\r\nper cent. of the performing get of George Wilkes’ sons are pacers,\r\nand frequently pacers of extreme speed, including such as Joe Patchen,\r\n2:03, and Rubenstein, 2:05, while John R. Gentry, 2:00½, Online, 2:04,\r\nand Frank Agan, 2:03, are by grandsons of Wilkes. Like his sire, George\r\nWilkes got many sons greater than himself—and after all that is the true\r\ntest of greatness in a progenitor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTIONEER.\r\n\r\nA Great Son of Hambletonian.]\r\n\r\nELECTIONEER has for some years led, far and away, all sires of trotters\r\nin the numbers of performers to his credit in both the 2:20 list and\r\n2:30 list, and is generally conceded to have had no equal as a producer\r\nof early speed—that is, of colts and fillies that trotted fast at tender\r\nages. In many respects this was the most remarkable horse of any age,\r\nfor besides being phenomenally prolific in transmitting speed at the\r\ntrot, and in getting early trotters, he possessed in a higher degree than\r\nany sire that has yet lived the ability to control running blood in the\r\ndam, and to impress his own instinct and action upon his progeny out of\r\nany and all kinds of mares. In speaking on his pet hobby of producing\r\ntrotters from thoroughbred running mares, Governor Stanford once said\r\nto me: “None of my stallions but Electioneer can do it;” and of all the\r\nhundreds of stallions that have been mated with thoroughbred mares in\r\nthe hope of getting a trotter of extreme speed, Electioneer alone was\r\nable to do it. Palo Alto, 2:08¼, is so far faster than any other trotting\r\nhorse out of a thoroughbred dam—the one solitary instance on record of a\r\nhalf-bred trotter of extreme speed—that he is significant in one way, and\r\none only, and that is as an evidence of the phenomenal prepotency of the\r\nblood of his sire in controlling instinct and action.\r\n\r\nElectioneer was a dark bay horse, foaled May 2, 1868, bred by Charles\r\nBackman, at his Stonyford Stud, Orange County, New York. He was got by\r\nHambletonian, out of Green Mountain Maid, by Harry Clay, 2:29, grandam\r\nthe fast trotting mare Shanghai Mary, pedigree not established, but in\r\nall probability a daughter of Iron’s Cadmus, the sire of the famous\r\nold pacer and brood mare Pocahontas, 2:17½. (In Chapter XXIX., on the\r\ninvestigation of pedigrees, the history of Shanghai Mary is fully given.)\r\nGreen Mountain Maid, the dam of Electioneer, has been called by Mr.\r\nBackman, and with justice, “the great mother of trotters.” In all she\r\nbore sixteen foals, fourteen of which were by the not remarkable horse\r\nMessenger Duroc. Electioneer was her second foal and the only one by\r\nHambletonian. Of the other fifteen, nine have records of 2:30 and better,\r\nanother has a record of 2:31, another, Paul, was a very fast road\r\nhorse, and two died young. Of her four sons kept entire, Electioneer,\r\nMansfield, Antonio, and Lancelot, all are sires of trotters, and her\r\ndaughters already figure as producers. The figures would seem to point to\r\nthe daughter of Shanghai Mary and Harry Clay, 2:29, as perhaps the most\r\nwonderful of all great trotting brood mares. She was a brown mare, barely\r\nfifteen hands high, with a star and white hind ankles, and was finely\r\nformed, with an exceptionally beautifully outlined and expressive head.\r\nShe had very superior trotting action, the trot being her fastest natural\r\ngait. A writer who made a very close study of her history said, on this\r\npoint, in _Wallace’s Monthly_:\r\n\r\n    “Her education was limited to a single lesson when three\r\n    years old; but previously she had been regularly developed on\r\n    somewhat the same plan since adopted for early training at\r\n    Palo Alto, and was probably one of the fastest trotters out of\r\n    harness that ever lived.”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact Green Mountain Maid, while in no sense vicious,\r\nwas so highly strung, wild and uncontrollable, that her training was\r\nabandoned with the “one lesson” referred to, and she never wore harness\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nGreen Mountain Maid was a money producer as well as a speed producer. Mr.\r\nBackman paid four hundred and fifty dollars for her when she was carrying\r\nher first foal, and the writer above quoted states that up to that date\r\n(1889) Mr. Backman had received sixty-eight thousand eight hundred\r\nand thirty dollars for such of her progeny as he had then sold. This\r\nremarkable mare died June 6, 1888, and a fitting monument marks her grave\r\nby the banks of the Walkill.\r\n\r\nAt maturity Electioneer was of that shade of bay that many might call\r\nbrown, and stood precisely fifteen and one-half hands at the wither\r\nand an inch higher measured at the quarter. Many of his get, notably\r\nSunol, are pronouncedly higher behind than at the wither. In general\r\nconformation, Electioneer was a stout and muscular horse, standing on\r\nfairly short legs. His head was well proportioned, of fair size, and\r\na model of intelligent beauty. The forehead was broad and brainy, the\r\neyes large and softly expressive, and the profile regular, with just\r\nthe faintest suggestion of concavity beneath the line of the eyes.\r\nElectioneer’s neck was a trifle too short for elegance of proportion,\r\nbut not gross. His shoulder was good, the barrel round, of good depth\r\nand proportionate in length and well ribbed, and the coupling simply\r\nfaultless. The quarters were marvelous, and Mr. Marvin did not overstate\r\nthe case when he said they were the best he had ever seen on any\r\nstallion. They were the very incarnation of driving power, and recalled\r\nHerbert Kittredge’s portrait of Hambletonian, except that there was\r\nnothing gross or meaty about the buttocks of Electioneer. They were the\r\nperfection of muscular endowment and development. The arms and gaskins,\r\nlike the quarters, were full with muscle laid on muscle, and the legs and\r\nfeet were naturally excellent. In the last years of his life he went over\r\non his knees a bit, but that was not strange considering his age, and the\r\nfact that he had seen considerable track work. Indeed as long as he was\r\nat all vigorous he was daily exercised on the track, and in view of his\r\ngreat success in the stud, this fact has a special significance.\r\n\r\nAs a three-year-old Electioneer was worked some on the Stonyford farm\r\ntrack to wagon, and Mr. Backman, whose word is good enough authority for\r\nall who know him, stated that he showed a quarter to wagon in thirty-nine\r\nseconds in that year. Little else is known of his history at Stonyford.\r\nHe was bred to a few, very few mares, and was evidently not greatly\r\nesteemed by Mr. Backman. In the autumn of 1876, ex-Governor Stanford, who\r\nwas just establishing his great breeding farm, Palo Alto, in the Santa\r\nClara Valley, California, visited Stonyford to purchase stock—principally\r\nbrood mares. The governor was a great believer in what I may call\r\nhorse-physiognomy, or to be more exact, he believed in the importance of\r\nthe right psychical organization, what we commonly call brain force, in\r\nhorses, and was attracted by the physical evidences thereof as indicated\r\nin the head. Electioneer pleased him in this regard, and in his general\r\nmake-up, and when the governor’s purchase was completed Electioneer went\r\nalong, being put in at twelve thousand five hundred dollars. He with the\r\nother Stonyford purchases arrived at Palo Alto Christmas Eve, 1876.\r\n\r\nThough Electioneer never took a record, he was emphatically a developed\r\nhorse. I do not know whether he was ever driven a full mile or not—Mr.\r\nMarvin never drove him one—but it has been stated that one of the other\r\ntrainers drove him a mile in time somewhere between 2:20 and 2:25.\r\nHowever they may be, Mr. Marvin in his book settles the question as to\r\nhis having been a fast, trained trotter. He says:\r\n\r\n    “Electioneer is the most natural trotter I have ever seen.\r\n    He has free, abundant action; it is a perfect rolling action\r\n    both in front and behind, and he has not the usual fault of\r\n    the Hambletonians of going too wide behind. Certain writers\r\n    have said that Electioneer could not trot, and have cited him\r\n    as a stallion that was not a trotter yet got trotters.... I\r\n    have driven, beside Electioneer, a quarter in thirty-five\r\n    seconds.... He did this, too, hitched to a one hundred and\r\n    twenty-five-pound wagon, with a two hundred and twenty-pound\r\n    man, and not a professional driver, either, in the seat. In\r\n    this rig he could carry Occident right up to his clip, and\r\n    could always keep right with him; and it was no trick for\r\n    the famous St. Clair gelding to go a quarter in thirty-four\r\n    seconds. Without preparation you could take Electioneer out any\r\n    day and drive him an eighth of a mile at a 2:20 gait. He always\r\n    had his speed with him.... That Electioneer could have beaten\r\n    2:20 if given a regular preparation is with me a conviction\r\n    about which no doubt exists.”\r\n\r\nMr. Marvin is a conservative and reliable man; he knew whereof he wrote,\r\nand his testimony must be accepted as conclusive both as to Electioneer’s\r\nhaving been a naturally fast trotter, and as to his having had his speed\r\ndeveloped. Undeveloped horses do not trot quarters in thirty-five seconds.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1880 Fred Crocker, one of the seven foals got by Electioneer in\r\nhis first year’s service in California, astonished the world by trotting\r\nto a two-year-old record of 2:25¾, his sire became instantly famous, and\r\nthat fame has increased rapidly and steadily from that day to this. It\r\nwas not allowed for a moment to wane or lag. After Fred Crocker came an\r\never-surprising procession of young record breakers. In 1881 Hinda Rose\r\nmade a yearling record of 2:36½, and Wildflower a two-year-old record\r\nof 2:21. In 1883 Hinda Rose lowered the three-year-old record to 2:19½,\r\nand Bonita the four-year-old record to 2:18¾. In 1886 Manzanita lowered\r\nthe four-year-old record to 2:16; in 1887 Norlaine, granddaughter of\r\nElectioneer, lowered the yearling record to 2:31½; and in 1888 Sunol\r\nput the two-year-old record at 2:18, and the year following took a\r\nthree-year-old record of 2:10½, the fastest to that date. Sunol captured\r\nthe four-year-old record in 1889, and the world’s record, 2:08¼, in 1891,\r\nbut what made this the brightest year in all the history of Palo Alto was\r\nthat Arion lowered the two-year-old record to 2:10¾—the most remarkable\r\nof all trotting performances—Bell Bird the yearling record to 2:26¼,\r\nand Palo Alto the stallion record to 2:08¾. Electioneer has now to his\r\ncredit one hundred and fifty-four standard performers, and in this and in\r\nthe 2:20 list he has a long lead over all other sires. He died at Palo\r\nAlto, December 3, 1890, and I am informed that his skeleton has been\r\narticulated and mounted for the museum of the Stanford University. The\r\nfollowing table gives the sons of Electioneer that up to the close of\r\n1896 had ten or more standard performers to their credit:\r\n\r\nLEADING SONS OF ELECTIONEER.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                              Total No. produced in two generations.\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n         Standard performers produced by sons and daughters. |\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------+      |\r\n                                 Producing daughters. |      |\r\n  ----------------------------------------------+     |      |\r\n                                Producing sons. |     |      |\r\n  ----------------------------------------+     |     |      |\r\n                     Standard performers. |     |     |      |\r\n  ----------------------------------+     |     |     |      |\r\n                       Year foaled. |     |     |     |      |\r\n  ---------------------------+      |     |     |     |      |\r\n           Name.             |      |     |     |     |      |\r\n  ---------------------------+------+-----+-----+-----+------+------\r\n  Saint Bell, 2:24½          | 1882 |  47 |   1 |  —— |    1 |   48\r\n  Sphinx, 2:20½              | 1883 |  43 |  —— |  —— |   —— |   43\r\n  Chimes, 2:30¾              | 1884 |  32 |   3 |  —— |    3 |   35\r\n  Anteeo, 2:16¼              | 1879 |  28 |   5 |   3 |   12 |   40\r\n  Norval, 2:14¾              | 1882 |  24 |   1 |  —— |    1 |   25\r\n  Egotist, 2:22½             | 1885 |  18 |   1 |  —— |    1 |   19\r\n  Anteros                    | 1882 |  16 |  —— |   2 |    2 |   18\r\n  Elector (2170), 2:31       | 1879 |  16 |  —— |  —— |   —— |   16\r\n  Albert W., 2:20            | 1878 |  15 |   1 |  —— |    1 |   16\r\n  Eros, 2:29¼                | 1879 |  14 |   3 |  —— |    4 |   18\r\n  Antevolo, 2:19½            | 1881 |  13 |  —— |   1 |   11 |   14\r\n  *Bell Boy, 2:19¼           | 1885 |  11 |   1 |  —— |    1 |   12\r\n  Fallis, 2:23               | 1878 |  10 |   1 |  —— |    3 |   13\r\n  Palo Alto, 2:08¾           | 1882 |  10 |  —— |  —— |   —— |   10\r\n  ---------------------------+------+-----+-----+-----+------+------\r\n\r\n  * Died at 5 years old.\r\n\r\nIn considering this table it is necessary to remember that the\r\nElectioneer family dates from 1878, and that no family of anything\r\napproaching so late a date makes a showing that will bear comparison with\r\nthis. In considering the rank of families this question of age is always\r\nvital. Electioneer’s first crop of foals at Palo Alto—1878—numbered\r\nseven, and of these two are represented above, while another was the\r\nfamous gelding Fred Crocker. The next numbered but twenty-one, and of\r\nthese Eros, Elector, and Anteeo are in the table, and ten are in the\r\n2:20 list. His third and fourth crops (1880 and 1881) numbered sixteen\r\nand twenty-three respectively, and the forty of 1882 was the greatest\r\nnumber he ever got in one year. I am informed that in all Electioneer\r\ngot less than four hundred foals at Palo Alto; and that, since the first\r\none saw light in 1878 this family should in eighteen years make the\r\nshowing it has with nearly fifty per cent. of its members in the 2:30\r\nlist, and four hundred and ninety-three of the second generation also\r\nthere, is certainly remarkable. Electioneer has to his credit in the\r\n2:15 list the following trotters: Arion, 2:07¾, Sunol, 2:08¼, Palo Alto,\r\n2:08¾, Helena, 2:12½, Belleflower, 2:12¾, Utility, 2:13, Quality, 2:13¼,\r\nConductor, 2:14¼, and Norval, 2:14¾, an “extreme speed list” greater\r\nthan to the credit of any other sire, while among the get of his sons\r\nare such trotters as Azote, 2:04¾, Fantasy, 2:06, Little Albert, 2:10,\r\nLynne Bel, 2:10½, Copeland, 2:11½, Athanio, 2:11¾, Cobwebs, 2:12, etc.,\r\netc. Sixty-five of his sons have sired four hundred and thirty-seven\r\nperformers, and forty-three of his daughters have produced fifty-six\r\nperformers. With all these facts kept in view the study of the above\r\ntable will prove interesting and instructive in forming an estimate of\r\nthe merit of Electioneer as a trotting progenitor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ABDALLAH (ALEXANDER’S).\r\n\r\nA Great Son of Hambletonian.]\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S ABDALLAH was the founder of one of the very greatest of the\r\nHambletonian sub-families, and he stands in the records as a progenitor\r\nof the first rank. This was a stout bay horse, about fifteen and one-half\r\nhands high. Excepting a right white ankle he was a rich solid bay. The\r\nonly reliable portrait in existence of this horse was a drawing by\r\nHerbert Kittredge, made from a photograph taken of Abdallah after he went\r\nto Kentucky. The picture of Abdallah published in this work is a faithful\r\nreproduction of the Kittredge portrait published in _Wallace’s Monthly_\r\nfor March, 1881, and in the absence of any reliable detailed description\r\nof the horse this portrait must be taken as the best reflection we now\r\nhave of his individuality. He was bred by Lewis J. Sutton, of Warwick,\r\nOrange County, New York, and was foaled 1852. Mr. Sutton had in 1851\r\na good road mare that he had got at Carl Young’s roadhouse in Third\r\nAvenue, New York. This mare, Katy Darling, had been quite a trotter,\r\nand had, it was said, won a match race on Union Course. Her reputation\r\nas a trotter and her fine form caused Mr. Sutton to buy her when, as he\r\ndescribes it, “she was standing on three legs,” in the hope of getting a\r\nfoal from her. He took her home in March, 1851, and in August bred her\r\nto Rysdyk’s Hambletonian, then a two-year-old colt, and September 22,\r\n1852, she produced the subject of this sketch. Two years later Mr. Sutton\r\nsold Katy Darling to James W. Benedict, of Warwick, from whom she was\r\npurchased by Hezekiah Hoyt, who took her to Muscatine, Iowa, where she\r\nproduced a chestnut colt that was gelded, by Hector, son of La Tourrett’s\r\nBellfounder. This gelding was her only foal other than Alexander’s\r\nAbdallah, and Katy Darling died at Muscatine, the property of a Mr.\r\nStewart. A search was long kept up for the pedigree of this mare, and for\r\nthe full details of what is known of her history the reader is referred\r\nto the different volumes of _Wallace’s Monthly_. The conclusion from all\r\nthe evidence found is that she was probably by a son of Andrew Jackson.\r\n\r\nAs a foal by his dam’s side Alexander’s Abdallah attracted much favorable\r\nattention by his fine trotting action, and his persistency in cavorting\r\naround at that gait. Among those who took great delight in watching the\r\nlittle fellow trot was Mr. Hezekiah Hoyt, and when the youngster was\r\nseventeen months old Mr. Hoyt, acting for, or in partnership with, Major\r\nEdsall, bought the colt for five hundred dollars, a fine price at that\r\ntime. Major Edsall kept him until he was seven years old, and I am under\r\nthe impression that he won some local races during that time, when he\r\nwas known as Edsall’s Hambletonian. He was accorded a fairly liberal\r\npatronage in Orange County, and his progeny showed so well that Major\r\nEdsall sold him for three thousand dollars in 1859 to Joel F. Love and\r\nJames Miller, of Cynthiana, Kentucky. The Hambletonian family was just\r\nthen becoming popular, and the price paid indicates that this horse was\r\nalready regarded by good judges as one of Hambletonian’s best sons.\r\nThat he was regarded, moreover, as quite a trotter is indicated by the\r\nfact that at the close of his second season in Kentucky—1860—Mr. Miller\r\nmatched him against Albion, a competing stallion, for two hundred and\r\nfifty dollars a side. The affair caused quite a sensation at the time,\r\nthe Cynthiana horsemen going in crowds to Lexington to back Abdallah.\r\nThe latter was driven by “Jim” Monroe, and Albion by Warren Peabody,\r\nand Abdallah won in the hollowest fashion, distancing Albion in 2:46.\r\nAs youngsters Abdallah’s first progeny in Kentucky showed very well,\r\nand in the spring of 1863 he was purchased by R. A. Alexander, and made\r\nthe seasons of 1863 and 1864 at Woodburn. On the evening of February 2,\r\n1865, Marion’s band of Confederate guerrillas raided Woodburn and took\r\naway a number of horses, among them Alexander’s Abdallah and the then\r\nfamous young trotter, Bay Chief, by Mambrino Chief. Marion mounted Bay\r\nChief and, crossing the Kentucky River, the band encamped on the farm of\r\na Mr. Bush, in a rough, hilly region, twelve miles from Woodburn. Here\r\nthe next morning the Federal cavalry, that were sent in pursuit after\r\nthe raid, came up with the raiders, and after a sharp fight routed them.\r\nMarion, on Bay Chief, was a conspicuous mark for Federal bullets during\r\nthe skirmish. Early in the fray Bay Chief was shot through the muzzle,\r\nthrough both thighs, and one hock. In this condition he carried his rider\r\ntwo miles in the retreat, when the horse was so weakened by loss of blood\r\nthat a Federal cavalryman overtook them. His piece being empty, the\r\nsoldier aimed a blow at Marion, but missing him, lost his balance, and\r\nfell from his horse. The guerrilla leader quickly saw his opportunity,\r\njumped from Bay Chief, mounted the soldier’s horse, and escaped. Bay\r\nChief died about ten days later, despite all efforts made to save him.\r\nMeanwhile, Alexander’s Abdallah had been found, safe and sound, by a\r\nFederal soldier in Mr. Bush’s stable. The soldier refused to give him up\r\nto Mr. Alexander’s men, and declared he would send him North and keep him\r\nuntil he got a large reward for his return. The horse was barefooted and\r\nin no condition for hard usage. And so they rode him off, and after going\r\nsome forty or fifty miles he gave out, and they turned him loose on the\r\nroad. He was found next day in a pitiable condition by the roadside, and\r\nbrought back as far as Lawrenceburg on his way home, where he was taken\r\nwith pneumonia and died a few days later.\r\n\r\nJust how great a loss this was to the trotting breed was not realized\r\nuntil long after—until in fact Goldsmith Maid had conquered all before\r\nher, and made a record as a campaigner never equaled, and until his two\r\ngreat sons, Almont and Belmont, rose to pre-eminent places in the list of\r\ngreat sires. Other sons of this remarkable progenitor have taken rank as\r\nsires, and his daughters proved of the highest excellence as brood mares;\r\nbut Almont and Belmont have each established such large, important, and\r\npopular sub-families that this work would be incomplete without some\r\nbrief sketch of each.\r\n\r\nAlexander’s Abdallah got Goldsmith Maid, 2:14, Rosalind, 2:21⅔,\r\nThorndale, 2:22¼, Major Edsall, 2:29, and St. Elmo, 2:30. Fourteen of\r\nhis sons have produced one hundred and fifty-five standard performers,\r\nand twenty-nine of his daughters have produced forty-four standard\r\nperformers, among them being the noted campaigners, Favonia, 2:15, and\r\nJerome Eddy, 2:16⅔, the latter also a successful sire. The following\r\ntable gives the families of his most prominent sons:\r\n\r\nLEADING SONS OF ALEXANDER’S ABDALLAH.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                    Total No. produced in two generations.\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n                Standard performers produced by sons and daughters. |\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------+      |\r\n                                        Producing daughters. |      |\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------+     |      |\r\n                                       Producing sons. |     |      |\r\n  -----------------------------------------------+     |     |      |\r\n                            Standard performers. |     |     |      |\r\n  -----------------------------------------+     |     |     |      |\r\n                                Year died. |     |     |     |      |\r\n  ----------------------------------+      |     |     |     |      |\r\n                       Year foaled. |      |     |     |     |      |\r\n  ---------------------------+      |      |     |     |     |      |\r\n           Name.             |      |      |     |     |     |      |\r\n  ---------------------------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+------+-----\r\n  Almont, 2:39¾              | 1864 | 1884 |  37 |  95 |  72 |  609 |  646\r\n  Belmont                    | 1864 | 1889 |  58 |  63 |  48 |  560 |  618\r\n  Hambletonian (Wood’s)      | 1858 | 1885 |  24 |  12 |  13 |   49 |   73\r\n  Major Edsall, 2:29         | 1859 | 1886 |   3 |   6 |   3 |   87 |   90\r\n  Thorndale, 2:22¼           | 1865 | 1894 |  10 |   8 |  14 |   47 |   57\r\n  Jim Munro                  | 1861 | 1882 |   8 |   5 |  17 |   38 |   46\r\n  Abdallah Pilot             | 1865 | 1881 |   3 |   1 |   1 |   17 |   20\r\n  ---------------------------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+------+-----\r\n\r\nALMONT was bred at Woodburn Farm, was foaled 1864, and was by Alexander’s\r\nAbdallah out of Sally Anderson, by Mambrino Chief; grandam Kate, a\r\nwonderfully fast pacer by Pilot Jr. Colonel R. P. Pepper informed me\r\nthat he knew Kate as well as any of his own horses, and that her speed\r\nat the pace was “simply terrific.” Kate, whose dam was called the\r\nPope mare, pedigree unknown, had several foals, among them the “catch\r\nfilly” that was the dam of Clay Pilot, sire of The Moor, that got the\r\ngreat brood mare Beautiful Bells, 2:29½, and Sultan, 2:24, the sire of\r\nthe world-famous Stamboul, 2:07½. Thus the blood of this pacing Pilot\r\nJr. mare figures in three great sub-families, the Almont family, the\r\nBeautiful Bells family, and the Sultan family. Almont was a beautiful\r\ncherry bay, very rich in shade, and without any white whatever. He\r\nwas fifteen hands two and one-quarter inches high at the wither,\r\nsomewhat higher behind, and stoutly and symmetrically made all over.\r\nHe could not be called a handsome or highly finished horse, but he was\r\nemphatically a well-made one. He had very excellent feet and legs,\r\nand these he reproduced with great uniformity, as well as his very\r\nintelligent and even disposition. He was trained early at Woodburn,\r\nand, like his sire, started but once and distanced his competitor in\r\n2:39¾, this being in his four-year-old form. He soon after showed 2:32\r\nover the slow Woodburn track, and was sold to the late Colonel Richard\r\nWest for eight thousand dollars and put in the stud. In 1874 the late\r\nGeneral W. T. Withers, Lexington, Kentucky, bought him for fifteen\r\nthousand dollars, and a half dozen of years later he was very generally\r\nregarded as the greatest of living sires, and his prestige made the\r\nname of Fairlawn Farm of world-wide renown, and made his owner rich.\r\nThe fact that ninety-five of his sons have sired standard performers,\r\na greater number of producing sons than is to the credit of any other\r\nhorse, Hambletonian alone excepted, indicates the high rank Almont must\r\nbe accorded as a progenitor. In considering his success it is well for\r\nbreeders particularly to note that good judges considered Almont capable\r\nof showing a 2:20 gait any day, and that, like Electioneer, he always was\r\ndaily given regular and ample track exercise. His gait has been described\r\nas bold and open, without an excess of knee action, but with immense\r\ndisplay of power behind. Almont died of spasmodic colic, July 4, 1884, in\r\nthe fullness of his fame, and at an age when, had he been more discreetly\r\nused in the stud, he should have been at his prime as a stock horse.\r\n\r\nAlmont was hardly a sensational horse in his day, the performance of\r\nWestmont at Chicago in 1884, when he paced a mile with running mate\r\nin 2:01¾, being the one sensational performance to the credit of his\r\nprogeny. This lightning streak of pacing speed that so often crops\r\nout in the Almont family can be readily accounted for by the student\r\nof breeding. As has been noted, his grandam Kate, by Pilot Jr., was a\r\nphenomenally fast pacer, and, as we have indicated, her blood proved\r\npotent in more than one line. In addition to this there was a strong\r\ntendency to pace among the progeny of Alexander’s Abdallah. St. Elmo\r\nwas first shown at fairs in Kentucky under saddle and as a pacer, and\r\nmany others of Abdallah’s get were known to naturally pace. When we\r\nreflect that in Almont this Alexander’s Abdallah blood with its pacing\r\npredilection was united with the blood of the old lightning pacer, Kate,\r\nwe need not be surprised at the great number of fast pacers that came\r\nfrom Almont and his sons. Belmont, too, has shown a tendency to get the\r\npacing gait with great frequency, but not in such frequency or at such\r\nhigh rates as his son Nutwood. As there could not be traced any known\r\npacing blood in Belmont’s dam, and as the fact that Alexander’s Abdallah\r\ntransmitted an inclination to pace has been generally not known or\r\nignored, some writers have been unable to understand why the Belmonts\r\npaced. He got pacers because he inherited that capacity from his sire,\r\nand Nutwood got more and faster pacers than Belmont, because in him the\r\npacing inclination inherited from Alexander’s Abdallah was reinforced by\r\nthe strong pacing inheritance of his dam, Miss Russell, the granddaughter\r\nof Old Pacing Pilot.\r\n\r\nAs shown in the table of Alexander’s Abdallah’s sons, Almont got\r\nthirty-seven standard performers, ninety-five of his sons sired five\r\nhundred and three standard performers, and seventy-two of his daughters\r\nproduced one hundred and six standard performers. His most successful\r\nsons are embraced in the following table:\r\n\r\nLEADING SONS OF ALMONT.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                             Performers produced in two generations.\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n         Standard performers produced by sons and daughters. |\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------+      |\r\n                                 Producing daughters. |      |\r\n  ----------------------------------------------+     |      |\r\n                                Producing sons. |     |      |\r\n  ----------------------------------------+     |     |      |\r\n                     Standard performers. |     |     |      |\r\n  ----------------------------------+     |     |     |      |\r\n                       Year foaled. |     |     |     |      |\r\n  ---------------------------+      |     |     |     |      |\r\n           Name.             |      |     |     |     |      |\r\n  ---------------------------+------+-----+-----+-----+------+------\r\n  Almont Jr. (1829), 2:26    | 1872 |  44 |   7 |  20 |   39 |   83\r\n  Altamont, 2:26¾            | 1875 |  39 |   7 |   1 |   10 |   49\r\n  Atlantic, 2:21             | 1878 |  24 |   6 |  12 |   22 |   46\r\n  Piedmont, 2:17¼            | 1871 |  19 |   3 |   8 |   18 |   37\r\n  Almont Jr. (1764), 2:29    | 1871 |  19 |  11 |  11 |   51 |   70\r\n  King Almont, 2:21¼         | 1874 |  14 |  —— |   1 |    1 |   15\r\n  Pasacas, 2:43              | 1870 |  14 |   4 |   6 |   13 |   27\r\n  Almonarch, 2:24¾           | 1875 |  13 |   2 |   3 |    7 |   20\r\n  Allie Gaines               | 1875 |  12 |   5 |   8 |   17 |   29\r\n  Harbinger                  | 1879 |  10 |   1 |   2 |    3 |   13\r\n  *Allie West, 2:25          | 1870 |   7 |   4 |  10 |   24 |   31\r\n  Abdallah Mambrino          | 1870 |  13 |   1 |  11 |   24 |   37\r\n  ---------------------------+------+-----+-----+-----+------+------\r\n\r\n  * Died at 6 years old.\r\n\r\nThis line is justly regarded with growing favor as one of our very\r\nbest and most productive sub-families, and one that is breeding on\r\nexcellently, generation after generation.\r\n\r\nBELMONT was a bay horse of very superior form and finish, bred at\r\nWoodburn Farm, and foaled there in 1864. He was by Alexander’s Abdallah,\r\nout of Belle (that also produced McCurdy’s Hambletonian, 2:26½, and\r\nBicara, the dam of Pancoast, 2:21¾) by Mambrino Chief; grandam Belle\r\nLupe, by Brown’s Bellfounder. Belmont and Almont were of the same age,\r\nand, perhaps because of his finer appearance, Belmont seems to have been\r\nthe preferred one at Woodburn, and was retained while Almont was sold.\r\nThough Belmont was a successful horse and established a great family, no\r\nthinking man can contend that he was the equal of Almont as a sire, when\r\nall the circumstances are considered. Almont spent almost his entire stud\r\ncareer at Fairlawn, where there never were five mares worthy in blood\r\nto be in a great trotting stud, where there were scores of mares of all\r\nkinds of poor and freakish pedigrees, even to “Arabs,” and where none of\r\nthe stock was ever trained. Belmont, on the other hand, was all his life\r\nat the head of the most famous, and, in his younger years, unquestionably\r\nthe best collection of trotting brood mares in the world, and where a\r\ntraining department was always maintained. Remembering these conditions,\r\nand contemplating the statistics of the two families, it is interesting\r\nto speculate as to how the records would stand had Belmont been at\r\nFairlawn, and Almont at Woodburn.\r\n\r\nLEADING SONS OF BELMONT.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                             Performers produced in two generations.\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n         Standard performers produced by sons and daughters. |\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------+      |\r\n                                 Producing daughters. |      |\r\n  ----------------------------------------------+     |      |\r\n                                Producing sons. |     |      |\r\n  ----------------------------------------+     |     |      |\r\n                     Standard performers. |     |     |      |\r\n  ----------------------------------+     |     |     |      |\r\n                       Year foaled. |     |     |     |      |\r\n  ---------------------------+      |     |     |     |      |\r\n           Name.             |      |     |     |     |      |\r\n  ---------------------------+------+-----+-----+-----+------+------\r\n  Nutwood, 2:18¾             | 1870 | 136 |  90 |  69 |  432 |  568\r\n  King Rene, 2:30½           | 1875 |  35 |  17 |  16 |   55 |   90\r\n  Egmont                     | 1873 |  34 |  13 |  11 |   38 |   72\r\n  Wedgewood, 2:19            | 1871 |  31 |  12 |   9 |   60 |   91\r\n  Vatican, 2:29¼             | 1879 |  14 |  —— |  —— |   —— |   14\r\n  Warlock                    | 1880 |  12 |  —— |  —— |   —— |   12\r\n  Monaco                     | 1878 |  11 |   1 |   4 |    7 |   18\r\n  Waterloo, 2:19¼            | 1882 |  10 |  —— |   1 |    1 |   11\r\n  Meander, 2:26½             | 1879 |  10 |   3 |   1 |    7 |   17\r\n  Mambritonian, 2:20½        | 1883 |  10 |  —— |  —— |   —— |   10\r\n  Herschell                  | 1883 |  10 |  —— |  —— |   —— |   10\r\n  ---------------------------+------+-----+-----+-----+------+------\r\n\r\nBelmont, besides having the advantage of excellent individuality was also\r\na trotter of no mean speed. He was driven a mile over the working track\r\nat Woodburn in 2:28½, and was, therefore, a quite well-developed trotter.\r\nHe never appeared in public, and has, therefore, no public history.\r\nThe most successful of his sons has been Nutwood, whose dam was Miss\r\nRussell, the dam of Maud S. This horse was himself a fast trotter in his\r\nday, taking a record of 2:18¾, and rose to great popularity and success\r\nin the stud. Daughters of Belmont, being nearly all out of producing\r\nmares, are greatly and justly esteemed as brood mares. Belmont died at\r\nWoodburn November 15, 1889. Belmont got fifty-eight standard performers,\r\nsixty-three of his sons sired four hundred and eighty-nine standard\r\nperformers, and forty-eight of his daughters produced seventy-one\r\nstandard performers. The rank of his best sons is shown on the preceding\r\npage; all having ten or more in the list of standard performers being\r\nincluded in the table.\r\n\r\nVOLUNTEER stands pre-eminent among trotting sires as the one horse\r\nagainst not one of whose get the epithet “quitter” was, as far as I am\r\naware, ever hurled. He did not get speed with remarkable uniformity, nor\r\ndid his progeny develop speed early or rapidly. They required persistent\r\ntraining, but when speed was developed in a Volunteer you had with\r\nit every other quality of a resolute, enduring race horse. They were\r\nhardy, rugged, good-limbed horses, and uniformly possessed stamina and\r\nresolution in the highest degree. Volunteer had the advantage of being\r\nowned by Alden Goldsmith, an ambitious and experienced horseman, and the\r\nfather of two of the most successful trainers of our day. The Volunteers\r\nhad, therefore, every advantage that training could give, and his rise to\r\nfame was largely due to Mr. Goldsmith’s constantly developing and racing\r\nhis progeny.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 Mr. Joseph Hetzel, Florida, Orange County, New York, bred the\r\nbay mare Lady Patriot to Hambletonian, 10, and Volunteer was foaled\r\nMay 1, 1854. This mare, Lady Patriot, was by a horse called Young\r\nPatriot, and out of Mr. Lewis Hulse’s trotting mare, and that is all\r\nthat is known of her pedigree. Her sire’s pedigree is wholly unknown.\r\nShe produced a numerous family, among them being Sentinel, 2:29¾, and\r\nGreen’s Hambletonian, brothers of Volunteer, and of some rank as sires,\r\nand Marksman, by Thorndale, that is also in the table of sires, while her\r\ndaughter Heroine, sister to Volunteer, produced Shawmut, 2:26.\r\n\r\nVolunteer was a bay horse, with a little white around the left hind\r\ncoronet, fifteen hands three inches at the wither, and sixteen hands\r\nmeasured at the coupling. He has been considered by many good judges to\r\nhave been the handsomest of all the sons of Hambletonian. He was a horse\r\nof superb form and of great elegance of carriage. With sufficient of\r\nmuscle and substance, he was built on graceful, finished lines, with a\r\nbeautiful head loftily carried, a long and graceful neck, a body stout\r\nbut finely molded, and all set off by a handsome mane and tail. His feet\r\nand legs were of superb quality, and despite his great age they were, it\r\nis said, without fault or blemish to the last. His temper and disposition\r\nwere good, though he was very high-spirited, and in harness he was\r\nespecially attractive. As a four-year-old Volunteer was sold to Mr. R.\r\nC. Underhill, of Brooklyn, after he had won a premium at the Orange\r\nCounty fair. In April, 1861, Mr. Underhill sent him to Tim T. Jackson,\r\nof Jamaica, Long Island, and in _Wallace’s Monthly_ for December, 1880,\r\nMr. Jackson gave his experiences with Volunteer, making among others this\r\nspecific statement:\r\n\r\n    “I had him at Union Course one day, and met Mr. Alfred M.\r\n    Tredwell there, and I got him to hold that watch on him. Had\r\n    him in quite a heavy single-seated wagon, weighing probably one\r\n    hundred and twenty-five or one hundred and thirty pounds. On\r\n    the first trial he trotted in 2:33. I said to Mr. Tredwell that\r\n    he could beat that, and he trotted the next mile in 2:31¼.”\r\n\r\nHe had previously been trained by William Whelan, at Union Course.\r\nIt was June 26, 1862, while he was in Jackson’s hands, that Alden\r\nGoldsmith, in partnership with Edwin Thorne, purchased this horse,\r\nthen called Hambletonian Jr., and he soon afterward became the sole\r\nproperty of Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Rysdyk greatly resented his having been\r\ncalled Hambletonian Jr., and early regarded him as a possible rival of\r\nHambletonian, and there was war from the start between the adherents\r\nof sire and son. The Civil War was just then at its height, and the\r\npatriotic and military spirit rampant, and Mr. Goldsmith aptly named\r\nhis horse Volunteer. Mr. H. T. Helm, who wrote a very detailed history\r\nof Volunteer twenty years ago, credits him with having trotted in 2:36\r\nto wagon at the Goshen Fair in the fall of 1862, beating Winfield, Grey\r\nConfidence and others. At Hartford, Connecticut, in August, 1867, he beat\r\nGeorge M. Patchen Jr., in a single dash in 2:37. He was, like nearly all\r\nthe other great sires, a developed trotter.\r\n\r\nIt is said that his early stud opportunities were so limited that at ten\r\nyears old he had but eighteen living foals. The first of his get entered\r\nthe 2:30 list in 1871, but from that time on his list rapidly grew, and\r\nthe great campaigners Gloster, Alley, Driver, Bodine, Huntress, the great\r\nthree-miler, and finally St. Julien, 2:11¼, then the fastest trotter in\r\nthe world, so spread the fame of Volunteer that when his sire died in\r\n1876 he was regarded as the greatest living sire of trotters. In 1882\r\nMr. R. S. Veech, probably the most intelligent breeder in all Kentucky,\r\nwhile on a visit to New York, telegraphed Mr. Goldsmith to know whether\r\nit was worth while for him to visit Walnut Grove, with a view to buying\r\nVolunteer, and Mr. Goldsmith’s answer reveals the regard in which he held\r\nhis horse. The pith of his admirably written letter was in this paragraph:\r\n\r\n    “While there is no person that would be more welcome at the\r\n    farm than yourself, if the only object of your visit would\r\n    be the purchase of Volunteer, then your trip would not be a\r\n    profitable or successful one, as no breeder in Kentucky has\r\n    money enough to buy him.... I have as high a regard for money\r\n    as the most of men for the uses it may subserve, but there are\r\n    certain things which money cannot buy, as the Teacher of old\r\n    taught Simon the Samaritan.”\r\n\r\nAnd so Volunteer remained at Walnut Grove, and “lagged superfluous on the\r\nstage” long after his owner had passed away, and died December 13, 1888,\r\nat the extraordinary age of thirty-four years, seven months and twelve\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nVolunteer sired thirty-four standard performers, and forty of his sons\r\nand forty-eight of his daughters produced an aggregate of two hundred\r\nand twenty-one standard performers. The most successful of his sons\r\nis the Michigan sire, Louis Napoleon, that was out of the Harry Clay\r\nmare, Hattie Wood, dam also of Victor Bismarck and Gazelle, 2:21. Louis\r\nNapoleon has twenty-seven in the standard list, and fourteen of his sons\r\nand twenty-two of his daughters are producers, his best son being Jerome\r\nEddy, 2:16½, sire of Fanny Wilcox, 2:10¼, and twenty-seven other standard\r\nperformers.\r\n\r\nDICTATOR very early in his career attracted attention as the full brother\r\nto the famous Dexter, who was his senior by five years, and who was\r\nking of the trotting turf, and the most famous trotter in all the world\r\njust at the time when Dictator was merging from colthood to maturity.\r\nDictator had thus from the very start the advantage of splendid stud\r\nopportunities. He was bred by Jonathan Hawkins, of Walden, Orange County,\r\nNew York, and was foaled in 1863. He was got by Hambletonian out of the\r\nfamous Clara, the dam of Dexter, 2:17¼, Alma, 2:28¾, Astoria, 2:29½,\r\netc., by Seely’s American Star; grandam the McKinstry mare, breeding\r\nunknown, but that produced Shark with a saddle record of 2:27¾. Dictator\r\nwas a seal-brown horse with a white rear ankle, and stood scant fifteen\r\nhands and one inch. He was made on a small but a fine model, and was,\r\nall in all, a handsome little horse, and most of his get partook of\r\nhis fine quality of structure, though many were unsound. Shortly after\r\nDexter made his _début_ on the turf, Dictator was bought by Mr. Harrison\r\nDurkee, a wealthy New York gentleman who had an extensive stock farm at\r\nFlushing, Long Island. The colt was then but eleven months old and was\r\nleft at the Hawkins farm until two years old. Then he was sent to Mr.\r\nAlden Goldsmith’s place, at Washingtonville, to be broken, after which\r\nhe was taken to Mr. Durkee’s farm. The colt was very fast, but the fame\r\nof Dexter was already wide, and, no great importance being attached to\r\ndevelopment of stallions in that day, he was considered of more value\r\nfor breeding than for racing. He was worked considerably at Mr. Durkee’s\r\nfarm, and Colonel John W. Conley and H. C. Woodnut, who at different\r\ntimes had charge of him, have both declared that they knew him to be\r\none of the fastest trotters of his day. In 1874 Colonel Richard West\r\nsold Almont to General Withers, and to fill his place leased Dictator in\r\nthe autumn of 1875, and he made the seasons of 1876 and 1877 at Colonel\r\nWest’s Edgehill farm, Georgetown, Kentucky. Standing at a higher fee\r\nthan Almont or George Wilkes, he attracted little outside patronage, and\r\nhe was returned to Long Island. It has been stated that when at Colonel\r\nWest’s, George Brasfield drove Dictator quarters as fast as thirty-four\r\nand one-half seconds. After his return to Flushing he sank from public\r\nnotice until the appearance of Director as a great three-year-old in\r\n1880. Then a couple of years later came the phenomenal Jay-Eye-See, and\r\nclose after him Phallas, and with these three great trotters on the turf\r\nat once “the sire of Jay-Eye-See, 2:10, Phallas, 2:13¾, and Director,\r\n2:17,” came again prominently before the public. In 1883 he was purchased\r\nby Major H. C. McDowell, and Messrs. David Bonner and A. A. Bonner, for a\r\nprice that was said to have been twenty-five thousand dollars, and taken\r\nto Ashland farm at Lexington. Eventually he became the sole property of\r\nMajor McDowell, and died May 25, 1893.\r\n\r\nDictator did not get speed uniformly. He was what might be called a\r\nsporadic sire, but those of his get that raced at all raced well. By\r\nfar his best son as a producer is Director, 2:17, that was out of Dolly\r\nby Mambrino Chief, and is the sire of sixteen trotters and pacers with\r\nrecords in the 2:20 list, including the champion trotting stallion\r\nDirectum, 2:05¼, and the one-time champion pacing stallion, Direct, who\r\nafter being practically crippled in trotting to a four-year-old record of\r\n2:18¼, carrying great weights to keep him at that gait, was allowed to go\r\nat his natural gait and paced in 2:05½, and is already a very successful\r\nsire. Phallas, 2:13¾, of whom high hopes were entertained, and who had\r\ngreat opportunities, proved practically a failure in the stud, though his\r\nson Phallamont, out of an Almont mare, ranks with Direct as the best of\r\nDictator’s grandsons. Dictator got fifty standard performers, forty-four\r\nof his sons have produced one hundred and seventy-three standard\r\nperformers, and forty-two of his daughters have produced sixty-one\r\nstandard performers.\r\n\r\nHAROLD became very famous when Maud S. became queen of the turf with\r\nthe then marvelous record of 2:08¾, a record that stood unequaled from\r\n1885 till 1891. This horse was bred by Charles S. Dole, Crystal Lake,\r\nIllinois, by whom he was sold, in an exchange of horses, to Woodburn\r\nFarm, when he was a yearling. He was foaled in 1864, and his dam was\r\nEnchantress (the dam also of Black Maria and of Lakeland Abdallah), by\r\nAbdallah. It was long claimed that this mare’s dam was a daughter of\r\nimported Bellfounder, but investigation exploded this claim. Harold was\r\na bay horse, without marks, just fifteen hands high, stoutly made but\r\nvery homely of form. He had a finely made head, but otherwise he was\r\nexceedingly plain, and when Maud S. came out the late Benjamin Bruce,\r\nin the _Kentucky Live Stock Record_, expressed wonder that “that little\r\nbench-legged stud” could have gotten such a mare. Harold’s full brother,\r\nLakeland Abdallah, was far superior to him individually, but ranks\r\nwith Hetzel’s Hambletonian, the brother to Volunteer, and Kearsarge,\r\nby Volunteer out of Dexter’s dams, in the fore front of the well-bred\r\nfailures in trotting history. Largely from his individuality Harold was\r\nnever, even when Maud S. was in the heyday of her renown, a popular\r\nhorse, and the figures given by the Woodburn management say that in his\r\nentire career he was bred to but five hundred and ninety-four mares, or\r\nan average of about twenty-five for each of his twenty-three seasons.\r\nWith the exception of Maud S., Harold got nothing of the first class,\r\nbut in the second generation the family holds better rank in respect\r\nto extreme speed production. Beuzetta, 2:06¾, Early Bird, 2:10, The\r\nConqueror, 2:13, and the great three-year-old Impetuous, 2:13, are out\r\nof daughters of Harold, while Kremlin, 2:07¾, Io, 2:13½, Rizpah, 2:13½,\r\nRussellmont, 2:12¾, and the great pacer Robert J., 2:01½, are among the\r\nproduce of his sons, and the present queen of the trotting turf, Alix,\r\n2:03¾, is out of a daughter of Attorney, by Harold. Harold died at\r\nWoodburn, October 6, 1893. This horse never trotted in public, but he was\r\nworked some for speed at Woodburn. As a six-year-old he is said to have\r\ntrotted the farm track in 2:40½, in which mile it is stated he “grabbed\r\na quarter” and was not worked again. He is the sire of forty-four\r\nstandard performers, forty-three of his sons have produced one hundred\r\nand eighty-one standard performers, and forty-five of his daughters have\r\nproduced sixty-seven standard performers.\r\n\r\nHAPPY MEDIUM was bred by R. P. Galloway, of Sufferen, New York, and was\r\nfoaled 1863. He was by Hambletonian, out of the famous old campaigner\r\nPrincess, 2:30, that trotted ten miles in 29:10¾ and two miles in 5:02,\r\nand was the great rival of Flora Temple, 2:19¾. Princess was a bay mare,\r\nfoaled 1846, by Andrus’ Hambletonian, son of Judson’s Hambletonian,\r\nthat was by Bishop’s Hambletonian, son of imported Messenger; and her\r\ndam was the Wilcox mare, by Burdick’s Engineer, son of Engineer, by\r\nimported Messenger. She campaigned from ocean to ocean, and her career\r\nis perhaps the most remarkable of the earlier trotting days. When young\r\nshe was mixed gaited, alternately pacing and trotting, and was put to\r\nwork hauling logs. Then her owner traded her for a second-hand wagon, and\r\nfinally she reached the hands of D. M. Gage, of Chicago. He put her into\r\ntraining, and she trotted some indifferent races as Topsy, was sold, and\r\ntaken across the plains to California. Here in 1858 she beat New York,\r\ntaking her record of 2:30. Then she fell into the hands of the notorious\r\n“Jim” Eoff, and the next year was matched against the then crack trotter\r\nof California, Glencoe Chief, at ten miles to wagon. These were golden\r\ndays on the coast, and this race was for the enormous stake of thirty-six\r\nthousand five hundred dollars. Princess won easily in 29:10¾, but the\r\nGlencoe Chief party being dissatisfied, another race was trotted the\r\nnext day at the same distance for five thousand dollars, Princess again\r\nwinning. There was after this nothing on the coast to race with Princess,\r\nand Eoff brought her to New York to try conclusions with Flora Temple.\r\nHer first race with Flora was at three-mile heats at Eclipse Course,\r\nLong Island, Flora winning, but at two-mile heats a week later Princess\r\nwon in 5:02, 5:05. In their subsequent races Flora turned the tables,\r\nthough in a stubborn contest at two-mile heats Princess forced the then\r\nqueen of the turf to make the long unbeaten record of 4:50½. She was then\r\nretired from the turf, and after passing through several hands became the\r\nproperty of R. F. Galloway, who in 1862 bred her to Hambletonian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NANCY HANKS.\r\n\r\nBy Happy Medium, record 2:04.]\r\n\r\nHappy Medium was a bay horse, with star, snip, and two white rear ankles,\r\nfifteen hands two inches in height, and was a shapely, attractive horse,\r\nwith excellent legs and feet. Some critics have found fault that he was\r\nlight barreled, and perhaps with some degree of reason, but as a whole he\r\nwas structurally much above the average of his time. As a four-year-old\r\nhe started at the Goshen Fair and won, taking a record of 2:54, which he\r\nlowered to 2:51 in 1868. The next year, 1869, at Paterson, New Jersey,\r\nhe distanced Guy Miller and Honesty in 2:34½, 2:32½, and these three\r\nperformances, all winning ones, comprise his entire turf career. He was\r\nin 1871 purchased at a very large price—said to have been twenty-five\r\nthousand dollars—by Mr. Robert Steel, who placed him at the head of\r\nhis Cedar Park Farm, at Philadelphia. In 1879 he was purchased by the\r\nlate General W. T. Withers, and taken to his Fairlawn Farm, Lexington,\r\nKentucky, where he remained until he died, January 25, 1888, at which\r\ntime he had more 2:30 performers to his credit than any horse then\r\nliving. The Happy Mediums developed speed easily and quickly, and were\r\nremarkable for the purity of their gait. The most famous of his get is\r\nthe mare Nancy Hanks, that lowered the world’s record to 2:04 in 1892.\r\nThe mares bred to Happy Medium never were as a whole of good breeding,\r\nand in his early stud career they were largely of inferior blood and\r\nquality. His fame has steadily grown, and with ninety-two standard\r\nperformers to his credit, and his sons and daughters breeding on, the\r\nblood of Happy Medium is justly held in very high esteem as a positive\r\nspeed-producing element. Fifty-one of his sons have produced two hundred\r\nand thirteen, and forty-seven of his daughters have produced fifty-nine\r\nstandard performers.\r\n\r\nJAY GOULD was one of the most famous of all the sons of Hambletonian on\r\nthe turf and the sensational trotting stallion of his day, and he now,\r\nin turn, takes a high place among producing sons of the great father\r\nof trotters. This horse was bred by the late Richard Sears, of Orange\r\nCounty, New York, was foaled 1864, and was got by Hambletonian, out of\r\nLady Sanford, by Seely’s American Star; grandam Old Sorrel, by Exton\r\nEclipse; third dam by Lawrence’s Messenger Duroc, etc. At maturity Jay\r\nGould was a handsome, blood-like horse, fifteen and one-half hands high,\r\nand a rich bay in color, with white hind ankles. With his dam he was\r\nsold while at her side to Charles H. Kerner, of New York, who soon after\r\ntraded them to John Minchin, of Goshen, for the then well-known trotter\r\nDrift, Mr. Kerner also paying a fair sum in cash. Later the colt came\r\ninto the hands of A. C. Green, of Fall River, and was by him named Judge\r\nBrigham. It is said that Mr. Green first learned that Judge Brigham was\r\na fast trotter through his taking fright at a train one day in 1870 and\r\nrunning away with him at a trot. Whatever the facts as to this are, it\r\nwas soon known that Mr. Green had a very fast trotter, and the next\r\nseason (1871) he started for a five-thousand-dollar purse at Buffalo,\r\namong the other starters being the already famous Judge Fullerton. To\r\nthe general astonishment, Judge Brigham “cut loose” in the second heat,\r\nwinning it in 2:22, thus equaling the stallion record then held by George\r\nWilkes, and placing to his credit the fastest heat ever up to that time\r\ntrotted by a horse in his maiden race. He won the race handily, and was\r\nthe sensation of the time. He was at once purchased for, I believe, the\r\ngreat price of thirty-five thousand dollars by the late world-famous\r\nfinancier, Jay Gould, H. N. Smith, and George C. Hall. Later Mr. Smith\r\nacquired Mr. Hall’s interest, and Mr. Kerner bought Mr. Gould’s, and\r\nfinally, some years after, Mr. Smith, who had established Fashion Stud\r\nFarm, at Trenton, New Jersey, and owned the noted mares Goldsmith Maid,\r\n2:14, Lady Thorn, 2:18¼, and Lucy, 2:18¼, became sole owner of Jay Gould,\r\nas Judge Brigham was renamed.\r\n\r\nThe week following his Buffalo race Jay Gould defeated another strong\r\nfield at Kalamazoo, Michigan; and in 1872 started four times, winning in\r\nall his races, lowering his record to 2:21¼, the then champion stallion\r\nrecord. He was kept in the stud in 1873, but being challenged on behalf\r\nof Bashaw Jr., the following year, was given a hurried fall preparation,\r\nand met his challenger at Baltimore. Bashaw Jr., broke down in the\r\nfirst heat, and Gould of course won an empty victory, but to satisfy\r\nthe audience was driven a public trial in 2:19½. Meanwhile Smuggler had\r\nlowered the stallion record to 2:20, and Jay Gould was sent against it\r\nat Boston, trotting under unfavorable circumstances in 2:20½ and 2:21½.\r\nThis practically closed his turf career. He made a number of seasons at\r\nFashion Farm, and in his later years at Walnut Hill Farm, near Lexington,\r\nKentucky, and died of old age June 10, 1894. Jay Gould’s opportunities\r\nwere never of the best. In his earlier years in the stud General Knox\r\nwas more used at Fashion Farm than Jay Gould, and there was no training\r\ndone at Fashion until 1886. Jay Gould is the sire of twenty-nine standard\r\nperformers, the most noted of which is the great mare Pixley, 2:08¼.\r\nFourteen of his sons have produced thirty standard performers, and\r\ntwenty-eight of his daughters have produced forty-six performers, among\r\nthe latter being the great pacer, Robert J., 2:01½, and such trotters as\r\nPoem, 2:11½, Colonel Kuser, 2:11¼, Mahogany, 2:12¼, Edgardo, 2:13¾, etc.\r\nHis most noted producing daughter is Lucia, whose dam was the famous old\r\ntrotting mare Lucy, 2:18¼, by George M. Patchen, 2:23½. Lucia is the dam\r\nof Edgardo, 2:13¾, Hurly Burly, 2:16¼, and several others in the 2:30\r\nlist, and her blood is breeding on through both her sons and daughters.\r\n\r\nSTRATHMORE, taking all things into consideration, must be rated among\r\nthe very greatest sons of Hambletonian. He was a solid bay horse, of the\r\nsubstantial Hambletonian type, foaled 1866, bred by Aristides Welch at\r\nhis Chestnut Hill farm, near Philadelphia, and was got by Hambletonian\r\nout of the quite famous trotting mare Lady Waltermire, by North American,\r\nand Lady Waltermire’s dam was said to have been by Harris’ Hambletonian.\r\nThis North American sired Whitehall, that got the famous trotter Rhode\r\nIsland, sire of the still more celebrated Governor Sprague, and in\r\nthe section treating of the latter the reader will find particulars\r\nconcerning North American. Lady Waltermire was a noted trotting mare in\r\nher day, and it has been claimed that she performed faster than 2:30, but\r\nI have never been able to substantiate this claim. When Strathmore was\r\na three-year-old, in 1869, I visited Chestnut Hill. Mr. Welch then had\r\nthree sons of Hambletonian, viz., William Welch, Rysdyk, and Strathmore,\r\nwho was then called Goodwin Watson. The two former were led out to be\r\nshown, but when I inquired for Goodwin Watson, Mr. Welch’s reply was “Oh,\r\nhe’s a pacer”—except that he used an adjective in connection with “pacer”\r\nthat added emphasis, and betrayed some degree of regret, or indeed\r\ndisgust. The fact that several of Strathmore’s sons have gotten many\r\nfast pacers need not be marveled at. I am not aware that Strathmore was\r\never trained, and probably his pacing inclination furnishes the reason.\r\nWhen he was seven years old he was purchased by Colonel R. G. Stoner,\r\nof Paris, Kentucky, and named Strathmore, and up to this time, Colonel\r\nStoner states, he had but three foals, one of which was afterward known\r\nas Chestnut Hill, 2:22½, the first of his get to earn a reputation. His\r\nfirst two seasons were made in Montgomery County, after which he was\r\ntaken to Paris, in Bourbon County. Colonel Stoner states in one of his\r\ncatalogues that Strathmore’s early opportunities in Kentucky were very\r\ninferior; that in 1877 and 1878 the service fees earned would not pay for\r\nhis keep; that up to 1879 he never served a mare with a record or the dam\r\nof an animal with a record, and that it was not until Steinway trotted in\r\n1878 as a two-year old in 2:31¾, and Santa Claus as a five-year-old in\r\n2:18 in 1879 that any good mares came to Strathmore. At Colonel Stoner’s\r\nsale, February 9, 1886, Strathmore was sold for two thousand one hundred\r\nand fifty dollars to Rockhill & Bro., of Fort Wayne, Indiana, and they\r\nowned him until his death, March 11, 1895. Strathmore has seventy-one in\r\nthe standard list; twenty-six of his sons and fifty-four of his daughters\r\nhave produced one hundred and fifty-eight standard performers.\r\n\r\nEGBERT is one of the youngest sons of Hambletonian, and has achieved very\r\nfair success in the stud. He is closely inbred to the Hambletonian, or\r\nrather the Abdallah blood, and is possibly the most notable instance of\r\na successful sire being very closely inbred. Egbert was bred by Hon. J.\r\nH. Walker, Worcester, Massachusetts, and was foaled in 1875. He was sold\r\nat the sale of Mr. Walker’s horses at Worcester in the autumn of 1877,\r\nwhen he was purchased for the then great price for a two-year-old of\r\nthree thousand four hundred and twenty-five dollars by H. J. Hendryx, of\r\nMichigan, a representative of Mr. Veech, of Kentucky, being a contending\r\nbidder. After the sale Mr. Hendryx sold the colt for four thousand\r\ndollars to George W. Raudenbush, of Reading, Pennsylvania, who I believe\r\nstill owns him. In the spring of 1880 Egbert was taken by Colonel Richard\r\nWest to his farm at Georgetown, Kentucky, and kept there a number of\r\nyears, and indeed the greater part of his stud career has been in\r\nKentucky. I am not aware that Egbert was ever trained. He is individually\r\na superior horse, but is alleged to have an unkind disposition.\r\n\r\nEgbert was got by Hambletonian out of Campdown, by Messenger Duroc\r\n(son of Hambletonian); grandam Miss McLeod (dam of Lord Nelson, 2:26¼,\r\nand Polonius), by the Holbert Colt (son of Hambletonian); great-grandam\r\nMay Fly, by Utter Horse, son of Hoyt’s Comet; great-great-grandam\r\nVirgo, sister to the dam of Messenger Duroc, by Roe’s Abdallah Chief,\r\nson of Abdallah, the sire of Hambletonian. The Holbert Colt, son of\r\nHambletonian, was a pacer, and others in Egbert’s ancestry paced; and in\r\ncommenting on his pedigree, from this point of view, at the time Colonel\r\nWest took him to Kentucky, I remarked in _Wallace’s Monthly_, March,\r\n1880: “Colonel West need not be surprised if he finds quite a number of\r\nEgbert’s offspring starting off at a pace.” The facts have borne out the\r\nprediction, as a glance at Egbert’s long list of fast pacers will show.\r\nEgbert is the sire of seventy-five standard performers, while twenty-five\r\nof his sons, and eighteen of his daughters have produced seventy-four\r\nstandard performers.\r\n\r\nMASTERLODE, that left a family of some merit in Michigan, was a mammoth\r\nbay, foaled 1868, got by Hambletonian out of Lady Irwin by Seeley’s\r\nAmerican Star. He was a gigantic, coarse horse, and was certainly the\r\nlargest horse that ever earned a reputation as a sire of trotters. It\r\nis said he was quite seventeen hands high and was built on a heavy mold\r\neven for his height. He was bred by James M. Mills, Orange County, New\r\nYork, and passed to A. C. Fisk, Coldwater, Michigan, who owned him until\r\nhis death in 1892. The most noted of his get was Belle F., 2:15¼, that\r\nwas one of the very best campaigners out in 1886. He has twenty-eight\r\nto his credit in the list, and seventeen of his sons and sixteen of his\r\ndaughters have produced in all fifty-seven standard performers.\r\n\r\nABERDEEN shares with Dictator such honors as attach to the highest\r\nsuccess of the “Hambletonian-Star cross” in the stud. This horse was\r\nbred by the notorious Captain Isaiah Rynders, at Passaic, New Jersey,\r\nand a full account of the investigation of the pedigree of his dam,\r\nthe noted Widow Machree, 2:29, will be found in Chapter XXIX., on the\r\ninvestigation of pedigrees. Widow Machree was altogether the best trotter\r\nof the American Star family, and was especially noted for her gameness.\r\nBred to Hambletonian, it was natural that she should produce a trotter,\r\nand Aberdeen was quite a trotter in his day. As a three-year-old he\r\nwon a stake at Prospect Park, distancing his field in 2:46, and the\r\nstatement has been published that he later in his career trotted a slow\r\nNew Jersey track in 2:24¼. This horse was foaled in 1866, and was a bay\r\nfifteen hands three inches high, and very stoutly, indeed coarsely made,\r\nand was of a dangerously vicious disposition. The good race mare Hattie\r\nWoodward, that made a record of 2:15½, first attracted attention to\r\nAberdeen as a sire, and in 1881 he was purchased by General Withers and\r\ntaken to Fairlawn, and before this his stud opportunities had been very\r\nlimited. He died in 1892. By far the best of his get is the great mare\r\nKentucky Union, that made a record of 2:07¼ in 1896. Aberdeen has forty\r\nin the standard list, fourteen of his sons have produced fifty-seven, and\r\nseventeen of his daughters have produced nineteen standard performers.\r\n\r\nSWEEPSTAKES must be classed among the successful sons of Hambletonian\r\nas a sire of trotters, though in the second generation his family have\r\nyet failed of great distinction, nor did Sweepstakes himself get extreme\r\nspeed. This was a bay horse, foaled 1867, by Hambletonian out of Emma\r\nMills, that also produced Mott’s Independent, by Seely’s American Star.\r\nHe was bred by the late Harrison Mills, near Goshen, in Orange County,\r\nNew York, and was never, I believe, trained. Indeed it has been stated\r\nthat he never wore harness, and is perhaps the most remarkable example of\r\na strictly undeveloped sire of trotters. The most noted of his get is the\r\nbay horse Captain Lyons, 2:17¼. Sweepstakes sired thirty-three trotters\r\nand two pacers that are standard performers, four sons have produced\r\neight trotters and two pacers, and twenty of his daughters have produced\r\ntwenty-five trotters and four pacers.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR SPRAGUE is one of the few horses not descended in the male line\r\nfrom one of the great foundation progenitors, and that yet was a trotter\r\nof merit and the founder of a trotting family. His dam, however, was a\r\nproducing daughter of Hambletonian, and this must be regarded as the\r\nprobable source of his power, though his sire was a fine trotter for his\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBack in the thirties a Frenchman living at Rouse’s Point, New York, near\r\nthe Canadian boundary line, bred a pacing mare to a horse that was kept\r\nin the same stable with Sir Walter, thoroughbred son of Hickory, and\r\nthe result was the horse known as North American, or the Bullock Horse.\r\nIt was long claimed that North American was by Sir Walter, but the best\r\nauthenticated version is given in _Wallace’s Monthly_, for 1880. This was\r\nthe statement of a Mr. Ladd, said to be a reliable man, who knew the\r\nFrenchman who bred North American. Ladd had formerly lived at Rouse’s\r\nPoint, and kept a little hotel at Benson’s Landing on Lake Champlain.\r\nLadd’s statement was that the Frenchman had a little pacing mare, from\r\nwhich he wanted to raise a foal, but would not pay more than three\r\ndollars for any horse’s service. Sir Walter’s fee was fifteen dollars,\r\nbut in the same stable was a large stallion that was used to haul water\r\nfrom the lake to the hotel, and the Frenchman was permitted to have the\r\nservice of this horse for three dollars, and this is the only reliable\r\nversion I could ever obtain as to the pedigree of North American. Besides\r\nthe line we are now considering, this horse got Lady Waltermire, the dam\r\nof the great Strathmore, and one of his daughters is the dam of two in\r\nthe 2:30 list, and Vergennes Black Hawk came from another. North America\r\nwas said to have been a natural trotter, and quite fast for a short\r\ndistance. A son of his, named Whitehall, from the name of the place where\r\nhe was bred, was taken to Ohio from New York about 1854 and there got the\r\nnoted Rhode Island, 2:23½, the sire of Governor Sprague. Rhode Island was\r\na brown horse, foaled about 1857, and his dam was by a black horse called\r\nDavy Crockett that was brought from Pennsylvania, and her dam was called\r\nBald Hornet. This mare, Mag Taylor, was bred to Whitehall twice, one of\r\nher foals being Belle Rice, the dam of the stallion Harry Wilkes, sire\r\nof Rosalind Wilkes, 2:14¼, and the other was Rhode Island. This horse\r\ntrotted many races, and at Fashion Course, New York, October 27, 1868,\r\nearned his record of 2:23½. He about this time passed into the hands\r\nof Sprague & Akers, and he died in 1875. At this time Governor Amasa\r\nSprague had among his brood mares Belle Brandon, by Rysdyk’s Hambletonian\r\nout of a daughter of Young Bacchus. This was a bay mare, foaled in 1854\r\nin Orange County, and was a fast trotter and a mare of great general\r\nexcellence. She was driven as a mate to Sprague’s Hambletonian, and Mr.\r\nSprague claimed that he had once driven her a mile in 2:29. Bred to\r\nVolunteer she produced Amy, 2:20¼, and to Rhode Island, produced in 1872,\r\nGovernor Sprague, 2:20½.\r\n\r\nGovernor Sprague was a black horse, approximating fifteen hands two\r\ninches in height, and very substantially built. He is described as having\r\nbeen an exceedingly handsome horse, especially in action, his gait having\r\nbeen pure and beautiful. In 1873 he was sent to Kansas and trained, and\r\nso promising was he that he was that year sold to Higbee Brothers and Mr.\r\nBabcock, of Canton, Illinois, for one thousand five hundred dollars.\r\nHe was shown and known as a very fast four-year-old, trotting public\r\nexhibitions in about 2:22. With the exception of a three-year-old race\r\nat Earlville, Illinois, he did not start in a public race until July 20,\r\n1876, when at Chicago he easily defeated a good field, and so promising\r\nand attractive did he seem that the late Jerome I. Case, of Racine, paid\r\nthe great price of twenty-seven thousand five hundred dollars for him.\r\nAt Poughkeepsie, New York, that season he lowered his record to 2:20½,\r\nand a few more races ended his short but brilliant turf career. He died\r\nat Lexington, Kentucky, May 23, 1883, at the early age of eleven years.\r\nHis stud career was therefore short, and this fact we must remember in\r\nestimating his rank as a sire. Kate Sprague, 2:18, and Linda Sprague,\r\n2:19, were about the best of his immediate progeny, and Rounds’ Sprague,\r\nthat has twenty trotters and pacers in the 2:30 list, some of them in\r\nbetter than 2:20, seems to be his most successful son. Governor Sprague\r\nhas to his credit thirty-six trotters and two pacers with standard\r\nrecords, twenty-two of his sons have sired fifty-four trotters and\r\nfifteen pacers, and his daughters have produced twenty-three trotters\r\nand six pacers. There was nothing in the inheritance of Rhode Island to\r\njustify a supposition that he would transmit speed uniformly, and, like\r\nSmuggler, the speed-getting power with him was sporadic. But from his\r\ndam, Belle Brandon, Governor Sprague received the blood of Hambletonian\r\nthrough an individual that had speed herself and naturally produced\r\nspeed; and this strain, combined with the blood of a horse that was good\r\nenough in his day to beat Lucy, American Girl and George Wilkes, gave\r\nGovernor Sprague a right to be all that he was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nMAMBRINO CHIEF AND HIS FAMILY.\r\n\r\n    Description and history of Mambrino Chief—The pioneer trotting\r\n    stallion of Kentucky—Matched against Pilot Jr.—His best\r\n    sons—Mambrino Patchen, his opportunities and family—Woodford\r\n    Mambrino, a notable trotter and sire—Princess—Mambrino\r\n    Pilot—Other sons of Mambrino Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\nMambrino Chief was a dark bay or brown horse, got by Mambrino Paymaster,\r\ngrandson of imported Messenger, and his dam was a large, coarse mare that\r\nwas brought from the West in a drove, and absolutely nothing was known\r\nof her blood. The theory was once advanced in print that she must have\r\nbeen by Stevens’ Messenger Duroc, but I think it was never repeated.\r\nThe basis of this theory was, that the horse referred to was large and\r\ncoarse, with a long thigh bone, and as the mare was large and coarse,\r\nwith a long thigh bone, she must have been a daughter of his. There are\r\nsome obvious difficulties about accepting this “thigh-bone” pedigree. In\r\nthe first place, the inventor of it never saw either the horse or the\r\nmare, and how could he have put his tapeline on their “thigh-bones” and\r\nthus ascertained they were of the same length? In the second place, it is\r\nnot known, nor was it known to the inventor, that the horse ever had been\r\nwithin three hundred miles of the dam of this “daughter” of his. It is\r\nnot much wonder that the “horse business” is hardly considered reputable\r\nwhen an educated man will advance such senseless gabble as the basis of\r\na pedigree. This mare produced another colt called Goliah that developed\r\nsome speed, but this was not the Goliah that was on the trotting turf.\r\n\r\nMambrino Chief was bred by Richard Eldridge, of Dutchess County, New\r\nYork, and was owned by Warren Williams; in the spring of 1851 he passed\r\ninto the hands of James M. Cockroft and G. T. Williams; was kept two or\r\nthree seasons in Ulster County; trotted, under the saddle a trial in\r\n2:36; sold to James B. Clay of Kentucky, in the winter of 1854, and then\r\nto Gray & Jones, 1857, for five thousand and twenty dollars, and died\r\n1861. Soon after his arrival in Kentucky he was matched to trot against\r\nPilot Jr., and the match stirred up a great deal of interest among the\r\nbreeders. He was so big and coarse and so far removed from the type of\r\nthe running horse that very few believed he could show any speed at\r\nany gait, for the distance of a mile and repeat. He was placed in the\r\nhands of Dr. Herr, who had had some experience in handling trotters, for\r\npreparation. When the day came there was quite an assemblage to witness\r\nthe race but the Pilot Jr. party came forward and paid forfeit. This was\r\na sore disappointment to those who thought the big horse could not trot,\r\nand to satisfy them that he could trot and trot fast, Dr. Herr drove him\r\nto show his gait, and notwithstanding his quarter cracks he satisfied\r\nall that he really was a trotter. This was an auspicious opening of a\r\nsuccessful career extending through the remaining six years of his life.\r\n\r\nIn the sense of success, Mambrino Chief was really the pioneer trotting\r\nstallion of Kentucky. True, “Old” Abdallah had been there fourteen\r\nyears earlier, but he was in bad shape and breeders did not like him.\r\nHe was very plain in his appearance and only left some half-dozen of\r\nfoals behind him when he was brought back to Long Island. The breeders\r\nall turned to his stable companion, Commodore, that was more after the\r\npattern of the running horse, and would not look at Abdallah. This\r\nCommodore filled the blue-grass fields with his foals, but none of them\r\ncould trot. He was a son of Mambrino, by imported Messenger, and was an\r\ninbred Messenger, if his pedigree was right, but he was a failure as a\r\ntrotting sire. Mr. Marcus Downing took his horse, Bay Messenger, there\r\nabout the same time and he was a failure also, notwithstanding he was a\r\ngrandson of imported Messenger. Both Commodore and Bay Messenger should\r\nhave been trotting sires, but either one of two reasons was sufficient to\r\nprevent that consummation. First their blood and physical structure were\r\nall right, but the mental structure—the instinct to trot—was lacking;\r\nthey inherited from some ancestor that could not and was not inclined\r\nto trot. Second, Kentuckians of that period knew nothing about trotters\r\nand they may have lacked in the requisite knowledge, skill and patience\r\nto develop them. It is true that old Pacing Pilot and some other pacing\r\ntribes were there that would occasionally throw a pacer with the diagonal\r\nmotion, like Pilot Jr., but there was no other blood there that trotted\r\nbefore the arrival of Mambrino Chief. This pacing element was a very\r\nvaluable element upon which to build up the trotter, but unfortunately\r\nand wherever it was possible, a running pedigree was tacked on to the\r\npacer, and thus, in the estimation of Kentuckians it was the running\r\nblood that did it.\r\n\r\nThe six years of his services in Kentucky gave sufficient time to\r\nestablish his value as a trotting sire, but not sufficient to build\r\nup a large family. This limited period must be further restricted, in\r\nestimating his value, by the fact that the war broke out in 1861, at\r\nthe very time when the larger part of his offspring were just at the\r\nright age for development. This important fact has been very generally\r\noverlooked when estimating the true value of this horse. The question has\r\noften been asked why this horse succeeded in Kentucky when he had not\r\nsucceeded in the North? This is too broad a question to be considered in\r\nthis historical sketch, but will be considered at another place in this\r\nvolume. In passing it, some very intelligent writers have attributed it\r\nto what is called “the climatic outcross,” and there may be some real\r\nvalue in this point, but the great cause, aside from the new surroundings\r\nand expectations of his progeny, may be found in the fact that his own\r\nspeed was never developed until the very eve of his transfer to Kentucky.\r\nHis instinct to trot and to trot fast had remained dormant, practically,\r\nduring the whole period of his Northern service, and when he reached\r\nKentucky he was, in a sense, a new horse and conscious of his powers as a\r\ntrotter. The salutary effects of development, at whatever gait, have been\r\nshown in ten thousand instances and will continue to be shown as long as\r\nthe interests and ambitions of man shall prompt him to strive to surpass\r\nhis neighbor.\r\n\r\nAt one time it was maintained right vehemently by the owners of the stock\r\nof Mambrino Chief, as well as some others, that as a stock horse he was\r\nnot only equal but superior to Hambletonian. In 1867, when the battles\r\nwere raging between Dexter and Lady Thorn, this view showed little\r\nabatement, and notwithstanding the gelding was beating the mare all the\r\ntime, they still maintained that in the end she would be the conqueror.\r\nWhen Lady Thorn was seriously crippled and retired from the turf, there\r\nwere many sad hearts in the Mambrino family and many wonderful stories\r\nwere told, privately, of what Dan Mace had seen her do, and that he was\r\nkeeping very quiet till an opportunity came to show the most wonderful\r\nflight of speed that the world had ever seen or ever would see. With\r\nthe shroud of what “might have been” about them, they were “of the same\r\nopinion still.”\r\n\r\nMambrino Chief left six in the 2:30 list; twenty-three sons that put\r\nninety-five in the list and seventeen daughters that produced twenty-four\r\ntrotters.\r\n\r\nLEADING SONS OF MAMBRINO CHIEF.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                   Performers produced in two generations.\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n                Standard performers produced by sons and daughters. |\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------+      |\r\n                                        Producing daughters. |      |\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------+     |      |\r\n                                       Producing sons. |     |      |\r\n  -----------------------------------------------+     |     |      |\r\n                            Standard performers. |     |     |      |\r\n  -----------------------------------------+     |     |     |      |\r\n                                Year died. |     |     |     |      |\r\n  ----------------------------------+      |     |     |     |      |\r\n                       Year foaled. |      |     |     |     |      |\r\n  ---------------------------+      |      |     |     |     |      |\r\n           Name.             |      |      |     |     |     |      |\r\n  ---------------------------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+------+-----\r\n  Mambrino Patchen           | 1862 | 1885 |  25 |  51 |  90 |  259 |  284\r\n  Woodford Mambrino, 2:21½   | 1863 | 1879 |  13 |  23 |  24 |  172 |  185\r\n  Mambrino Pilot, 2:34¾      | 1859 | 1885 |   9 |  17 |  15 |   71 |   80\r\n  Clark Chief                | 1861 | 1871 |   6 |  12 |  25 |   43 |   49\r\n  Ericsson, 2:30½            | 1856 | 188- |   6 |   4 |  15 |   25 |   31\r\n  Mambrino Chief Jr. (Fisk’s)| 1861 | 189- |   5 |   6 |  14 |   34 |   39\r\n  ---------------------------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+------+-----\r\n\r\nMAMBRINO PATCHEN was the best son of Mambrino Chief and was brother to\r\nLady Thorn, 2:18¼. He was foaled 1862, after the death of his sire, and\r\nwas bred by Levi T. Rodes. His dam was by Gano, a running-bred son of\r\nAmerican Eclipse; his grandam was a pacing mare by a colt of Sir William,\r\nbut what Sir William is not known; his great-grandam was an inveterate\r\npacer and never was known to strike any other gait. Mambrino Patchen\r\nwas so much smoother and handsomer than his sire, and was so much of a\r\nfailure as a trotter, that a very strong conviction prevailed among the\r\nfriends and neighbors of his owner that he was not a son of Mambrino\r\nChief, nor a brother of Lady Thorn. To this story that he was a Denmark\r\nand not a Mambrino Chief I never have given any shadow of credence. The\r\nattempt of his owner, Dr. Herr, to make him a trotter was patient and\r\npersistent, extending through several years, but with all his skill and\r\nexperience he failed. Nobody was ever able to “catch” him a mile, but it\r\nseems to have been conceded that he might go somewhere in the “forties.”\r\nWhile this persistent and long-continued training failed in its original\r\npurpose of giving the horse a record of reputable speed, there can be\r\nno doubt, under the law that governs, that this development did great\r\ngood to the horse, as a progenitor of trotters. The conditions being a\r\nhandsome horse, with the banner constantly flying over him, “full brother\r\nto Lady Thorn,” an industrious and very capable owner, in the heart of\r\nthe greatest breeding region in the whole country, it is easy to account\r\nfor a very wide and lucrative patronage. Still, as a getter of speed he\r\nwas not a great success, and as a getter of high speed he was a failure.\r\nWith all the facilities for development, only twenty-five of his progeny\r\nhave found a place in the 2:30 list, the fastest of which has a record of\r\n2:20½. Of his sons, fifty-one are the sires of one hundred and twenty-six\r\ntrotters, and of his daughters, ninety have produced one hundred and\r\ntwenty-nine standard performers. He has proved himself a very great sire\r\nof brood mares, and when his daughters are bred to horses of stronger\r\ninheritance, they stand among the best.\r\n\r\nWOODFORD MAMBRINO.—This son of Mambrino Chief was a large brown horse,\r\nfoaled 1862. He was bred by Mr. Mason Henry, of Woodford County,\r\nKentucky. His dam was also the dam of other trotters, was got by\r\nWoodford, son of Kosciusko, and her dam was a farm mare without any known\r\nbreeding. Woodford was a large, strong horse used only for farm work, to\r\nwhich he was well suited. After spending a good deal of time and labor on\r\nhis pedigree I am constrained to say that while he may have been a son\r\nof Kosciusko, his dam’s breeding is worse than unsatisfactory. Woodford\r\nMambrino made a record of 2:21½, and placed thirteen of his get in the\r\n2:30 list. He left twenty-three sons that were the sires of standard\r\nperformers, and twenty-four daughters that produced twenty-seven standard\r\nperformers. His son, Princeps, owned by Mr. R. S. Veech, of Indian Hill\r\nFarm, near Louisville, Kentucky, was in the stud far and away the best of\r\nhis sons, and although he had no record of his own he placed in the list\r\nforty-four trotters and four pacers, many of them with fast records.\r\n\r\nMAMBRINO PILOT was a very large and very coarse horse. He was a brown,\r\ngot by Mambrino Chief, foaled 1859, dam Juliet, by Pilot Jr.; grandam by\r\nWebster, son of Medoc; great-grandam by Whip. He was bred by Thomas Hook,\r\nof Scott County, Kentucky, and after passing through the hands of Dr.\r\nHerr and others he was sold to C. P. Relf, of Philadelphia, and, I think,\r\nremained in his family till he died, 1885. He had a record to saddle of\r\n2:27½. He put nine of his get into the 2:30 list, and seventeen of his\r\nsons left fifty-one performers and fourteen of his daughters produced\r\ntwenty performers.\r\n\r\nMany others of the descendants of Mambrino Chief might be noticed,\r\nbut it is not the purpose of this volume to dwell upon matters that\r\nare accessible in the current literature of the trotting horse. The\r\nfoundations of breeds and the leading heads of tribes must command my\r\nlabor. The table shows the rank of the other sons of Mambrino Chief that\r\nachieved any degree of success, and of these clearly the best was Clark\r\nChief, that died at ten years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE CLAYS AND BASHAWS.\r\n\r\n    The imported Barb, Grand Bashaw—Young Bashaw, an inferior\r\n    individual—His greatest son, Andrew Jackson—His dam a trotter\r\n    and pacer—His history—His noted son, Kemble Jackson—Long Island\r\n    Black Hawk—Henry Clay, founder of the Clay family—Cassius\r\n    M. Clay—The various horses named Cassius M. Clay—George M.\r\n    Patchen—His great turf career—George M. Patchen Jr.—Harry\r\n    Clay—The Moor, and his son Sultan’s family.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis family is no longer prominent in trotting annals and its blood has\r\nbeen practically absorbed by other strains that have proved themselves\r\nmore potent in transmitting and more uniform and more speedy in\r\nperforming. The name “Bashaw Family” is a misnomer and it should never\r\nhave been used, but as it has represented, for many years, the oldest\r\nline of developed speed, it seems a necessity to recognize it here. A\r\nbranch of this family, designated as “The Clay Family” has perpetuated\r\nitself in some strength and will be considered in this chapter.\r\n\r\nGRAND BASHAW, the horse that gave this family its name, was imported from\r\nTripoli by Richard B. Jones, who was the American consul at that port.\r\nMr. Morgan was associated with him, and they imported at the same time\r\ntwo other Barbs, Grand Sultan and Saladin. Grand Bashaw was kept in Lower\r\nMerion, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, several years; Grand Sultan\r\nwas kept in New Salem, New Jersey, for a time, and Saladin was taken to\r\nNorth Carolina and afterward died in Georgia. From these three horses\r\nnothing has been left to the horse history of the country but one single\r\nattenuated line. Grand Bashaw was a black horse, fourteen hands and an\r\ninch high, with a star and a snip on his nose. He was kept all his life\r\nin the vicinity of Philadelphia, and died at Newtown, Pennsylvania, 1845.\r\n\r\nYOUNG BASHAW was a grey horse, about fifteen and one-quarter hands\r\nhigh, and is the only descendant of Grand Bashaw through which we can\r\ntrace to that horse. He was foaled 1822 and was bred by Thomas Logan,\r\nof Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. His dam was Pearl, by Bond’s First\r\nConsul, a famous running horse, his grandam Fancy, by imported Messenger,\r\nand his great-grandam by imported Rockingham. This is the pedigree under\r\nwhich he was advertised, but it has never been authenticated in any of\r\nits crosses. Judging by the horse himself and his progeny there can\r\nhardly be a doubt that there was a Messenger cross in it, but just where\r\ncannot be determined.\r\n\r\nHe made his first season in Salem, New Jersey, 1826. He was then four\r\nyears old and by no means handsome or attractive in his form. His head,\r\near and neck were his worst features; but in addition to these defects\r\nhe was flat on the ribs and habitually carried his tail to one side. His\r\nlimbs and feet were as good as ever were made, but his great redeeming\r\nquality was his trotting gait. When in Salem he was only a rough, partly\r\ndeveloped, four-year-old colt, but he showed then a step and a rate of\r\nspeed so remarkable as to induce a few to breed to him, notwithstanding\r\nhis ungainly appearance. He did not cover more than a dozen mares that\r\nseason, and all-told he got eight foals. Out of these eight, seven proved\r\nto be superior trotters for that day. Andrew Jackson was the best, but\r\nthere was another that could go below 2:40. The common remark was,\r\nwherever he touched a mare of Messenger blood, there was sure to come\r\na trotter. This was the general rule, but the best hit he ever made,\r\nprobably, was when he covered Joseph Hancock’s black pacing mare and got\r\nAndrew Jackson.\r\n\r\nIn looking over his blood elements we can see nothing in his pedigree\r\nto justify these trotting qualities except the grandam, Fancy, by\r\nMessenger. First Consul was a great race horse, but neither he nor his\r\ndescendants ever evinced a disposition to trot. The horse Rockingham was\r\ncontemporaneous with Messenger and a constant rival while Messenger was\r\nabout Philadelphia. He was not wholly running-bred, as he was by Towser,\r\nafterward called Counsellor, and out of a hunting mare. As a stock horse\r\nhe was esteemed as only second to Messenger on the Delaware, where he\r\nstood many years.\r\n\r\nThe fame of Young Bashaw did not cease nor die out after the exploits of\r\nAndrew Jackson, Black Bashaw, Charlotte Temple, Washington and others\r\nfrom his own loins. The Clays, the Long Island Black Hawks and the\r\nPatchens have kept spreading it wider and wider until of late years we\r\nfind that only the one great Hambletonian family has overshadowed them\r\nall. Young Bashaw, after eleven years in the stud along the Delaware\r\nRiver, above and below Philadelphia, died at Morrisville, Bucks County,\r\nPennsylvania, June, 1837.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON was the most noted son of Young Bashaw. He was a black\r\nhorse, fifteen and a half hands high, with three white feet and a strip\r\nof white in his face. He was very well formed in every point and was\r\nstrong, compact, short-legged and handsome. He was foaled 1827, and was\r\nbred by Joseph Hancock, of Salem, New Jersey. His dam was a strong,\r\ncompact black mare that both trotted and paced, and was noted for her\r\nspeed at the latter gait. This mare was brought in a drove from Ohio, in\r\nthe spring of 1820 and on the twenty-first of June of that year she was\r\nsold to Mr. Hancock, of Salem, New Jersey, for one hundred dollars. He\r\nkept her a little over six years, and in the spring of 1826 bred her to\r\nYoung Bashaw, and in the fall of that year sold her to Powell Carpenter;\r\nand soon after he sold her to Daniel Jeffreys, a brickmaker on the\r\nGermantown road, near Philadelphia. She was then in foal by Young Bashaw,\r\nand the next spring she dropped the colt that became famous as Andrew\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nThe incidents connected with the history of this mare are here given,\r\nperhaps in unnecessary detail, but as Andrew Jackson was very extensively\r\nadvertised under a fraudulent pedigree from about 1834 till the time of\r\nhis death, and as I had at one time accepted it as true, it is better\r\nthat it should be made very plain, especially as I had been severely\r\ncriticised for changing it. The correction made, as above, was founded\r\non information received from two separate and distinct sources and both\r\nthoroughly reliable. The fraudulent pedigree of this mare represented\r\nher as “by Whynot, son of imported Messenger, and her dam by Messenger”\r\nhimself. This was just such a pedigree as so great a horse should have\r\nhad, but there was no truth in it. The attack was led by quite a large\r\nbreeder in one of the prairie States, who had a number of animals\r\nremotely descended from Andrew Jackson. He did not even pretend to know\r\nanything at all about the truth of the matter, but simply urged most\r\nvehemently that the pedigree should be restored because it was old. The\r\nfact of the matter was the man wanted the old lie instead of the new\r\ntruth maintained because it would help to sell his stock, which was the\r\nvery object for which the lie was originally invented.\r\n\r\nDaniel Jeffreys was very much addicted to trotting horses, and when he\r\nbought the black mare that was then carrying Andrew Jackson he kept her\r\nfor his own driving and named her “Charcoal Sal.” She was no doubt among\r\nthe fastest of the road horses, but there is no record of her ever being\r\nin a race. How much Jeffreys drove Charcoal Sal that autumn cannot now be\r\ndetermined; probably too much for the physical, but not too much, for the\r\nmental, organization of the foal she was carrying.\r\n\r\nAbout the break of day, one morning in the following April, somebody was\r\npassing Jeffreys’ brickyard (my recollection is, it was George Woodruff\r\nhimself), and he heard a splashing in the water accumulated in one of\r\nthe clay pits, and Charcoal Sal circling round in great distress. She\r\nhad dropped her foal, and in its weak efforts to get on its feet, it had\r\nrolled into the pit. It was at once pulled out and the family aroused,\r\nand no time was lost in rubbing it dry and wrapping it in warm blankets.\r\nSome of the mare’s milk was poured into it from time to time, and toward\r\nnoon it was so much revived and strengthened as to manifest a disposition\r\nto get on its feet. This was due, principally, to the womanly care and\r\ngood nursing of Mrs. Jeffreys. But, when helped up, he appeared to have\r\nstrength enough everywhere but in his pastern joints, and there he had no\r\nstrength at all. In this condition the colt remained a day or two, a most\r\npitiable and most helpless object, standing on its pasterns instead of\r\nits feet. One morning at the breakfast-table Mr. Jeffreys said he would\r\ngive any of the boys a dollar if he would put that colt out of misery\r\nand bury it out of his sight. Mrs. Jeffreys, whose womanly feelings and\r\nsympathies were all enlisted, replied to her husband’s remark that “the\r\nboy who would kill that colt never could eat another mouthful at that\r\ntable.” What a grand exhibition of true womanly instincts! Day by day her\r\nunremitting care was rewarded by seeing a little more strength gathering\r\nin the weak places, and at last her kind, motherly heart was gladdened by\r\nseeing him skip and play, a strong beautiful colt.\r\n\r\nMr. Jeffreys kept the colt till he was some five or six years old! and\r\nthen sold him to John Weaver, whose residence was about half a mile from\r\nthe old Hunting Park Course. He remained the property of Mr. Weaver\r\ntill he died, September 19, 1843. In his stud services he was kept on\r\nboth sides of the Delaware, in the region of Philadelphia, and made one\r\nseason, perhaps two, on Long Island. As a trotter he stood as the first\r\nof all stallions of his day.\r\n\r\nHis first race took place October 19, 1832, over the Hunting Park Course\r\nfor a purse of two hundred dollars for green horses, to saddle. He was\r\nentered under the name of “Brickmaker,” was ridden by George Woodruff\r\n(“Uncle George”), and beat Jersey Fagdown, son of Fagdown, by Messenger.\r\nTime 6:30, 6:23.\r\n\r\nThe next year he beat Jersey Fagdown again for the same purse and over\r\nthe same course.\r\n\r\nOctober, 1834, he again won the same purse, over the same course, at two\r\nmiles to saddle, beating Sally Miller. Time 5:26, 5:25.\r\n\r\nThe next October, 1835, over the same course, the same conditions, he\r\nbeat Lady Warrenton, by Abdallah, and Daniel D. Tompkins, by a son of\r\nWinthrop Messenger. Time 5:20, 5:19.\r\n\r\nThese performances have been extended far enough to give a just\r\nconception of his speed and his staying qualities. His races seem to\r\nhave been pretty much all to saddle and two-mile heats. In that day most\r\nraces were to saddle. George Woodruff told me he was on his back when he\r\nmade Edwin Forrest trot in 2:31¼ to win, but whether it was in a race or\r\na trial I cannot now recall. Mr. George Woodruff was an uncle of Hiram\r\nWoodruff and a very worthy man. To him I am indebted for all the details\r\nof the early life of Andrew Jackson, and they were of his own personal\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nKEMBLE JACKSON.—About the year 1853, of all the idols of the\r\ntrotting-horse world, perhaps no one had so many worshipers as Kemble\r\nJackson. In 1852 he was beaten by O’Blennis, three-mile heats in harness,\r\nand in April, 1853, he was beaten by both Green Mountain Maid and Lady\r\nVernon, mile heats in harness, but in June following he achieved a great\r\ntriumph. The race was on the Union Course and there was a vast concourse\r\nof people there to see it. The purse and stake was for four thousand\r\ndollars, three-mile heats to two hundred and fifty-pound wagons. The\r\ninterest was very intense, as O’Blennis, Boston Girl, Pet, Iola and\r\nHonest John were in it. Each horse in the race made better time than he\r\never made before, and yet Kemble Jackson took the lead and maintained it\r\nfrom end to end, without a skip or a break. After the first heat even,\r\nthe friends of O’Blennis would not hedge their money, for they had faith\r\nthat the gallant son of Abdallah would win. The finish of the second heat\r\nwas in the order above given. The time was 8:03, 8:04¾. Faster time has\r\nsince been made to wagon, but probably not with this weight and at this\r\ndistance. As a weight-puller for three miles I believe he still remains\r\nthe champion. He was a very strongly built chestnut horse, and was got by\r\nAndrew Jackson the last year of his life.\r\n\r\nThe pedigree of his dam was in confusion for a long time. Her name was\r\nFanny Kemble. There were a number of running-bred mares named after\r\nthat very popular actress, and everybody who had anything tracing to\r\n“Fanny Kemble” was sure that that particular mare was the dam of Kemble\r\nJackson. In the first volume of the “Register” he is given as out of\r\nFanny Kemble by Sir Archy, and in the second volume there was some\r\nfairly good evidence that he was out of Fanny Kemble by Hunt’s Eagle,\r\ntracing on through running lines. It is true he was out of a mare called\r\nFanny Kemble, but neither of the two foregoing. Her blood was wholly\r\nunknown. The Hon. Ely Moore was a member of Congress, and when on his\r\nway to Washington in 1839 he saw a very fine, stout-looking mare hitched\r\nto a gig in the city of Baltimore. She was a chestnut and showed such\r\nability to handle a great heavy gig with ease and rapidity that he bought\r\nher. He bought her for what she was herself and not for what her blood\r\nwas. There was no evidence asked or given as to how she was bred. This\r\nmare produced several foals to Andrew Jackson, the youngest of which\r\nwas Kemble Jackson. While he was still a colt, Mr. Moore presented him\r\nto his son-in-law, G. U. Reynolds, who still owned him when he died.\r\nMr. Reynolds is an intelligent and very reputable man, and this is the\r\nhistory of the origin of Kemble Jackson as given to me in person by him.\r\nMr. Moore paid two hundred and fifty dollars for this mare Fanny Kemble,\r\nand she was so handsome and so fast on the road that he considered her a\r\nvery cheap mare. The company never was too hot nor the road too long for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nEverybody has heard of “The Kemble Jackson Check” and nearly everybody,\r\nuntil within the last few years at least, has been using it without\r\nknowing just why or when it can be used with advantage. When in the\r\nhands of Hiram Woodruff, Kemble Jackson got into the habit of bringing\r\nhis chin back against his breast, and in that shape Hiram could pull\r\non him all day without getting control of him. In this dilemma, Mr.\r\nReynolds suggested an overdraw check which might prevent the indulgence\r\nof this bad habit. Hiram took the suggestion, had one made, and it was\r\na success, in his case. In twenty-four days after the performance which\r\nmade him a great name from one end of the land to the other he died of\r\nrupture. As he was only nine years old and as he was just beginning to be\r\nappreciated as a stallion the breeders of the country sustained a great\r\nloss. Up to this point in his history he had no reputation, had been\r\nlittle patronized and left but few of his progeny to perpetuate his name.\r\n\r\nLONG ISLAND BLACK HAWK.—This son of Andrew Jackson was foaled 1837 and\r\nhis dam was the distinguished trotter Sally Miller, by Tippoo Saib, son\r\nof Tippoo Saib by imported Messenger. This mare was bred in Bucks County,\r\nPennsylvania, and trotted as a three-year-old in 1828 on the Hunting Park\r\nCourse, Philadelphia. She was distinguished in her day, beating many of\r\nthe best, and was the first three-year-old trotter of which we have any\r\naccount. She was finally owned on Long Island, but I have never been able\r\nto learn the name of her owner. Black Hawk trotted some famous races on\r\nLong Island, the most noted of which, perhaps, was his match with Jenny\r\nLind in which he was to pull a two hundred and fifty-pound wagon, and\r\nthe mare the usual weight. In this match he beat her in straight heats.\r\nTime 2:40, 2:38, 2:43. In 1849 he beat Cassius M. Clay, time 2:41, 2:38,\r\n2:41. This horse was owned for a time by Jonas Hoover, of Germantown,\r\nColumbia County, New York, and was there called Andrew Jackson Jr., or\r\nYoung Andrew Jackson. He made some seasons in Orange County, and died at\r\nMontgomery in that county July, 1850. His progeny were not numerous and\r\nbut two of them from his own loins entered the 2:30 list. His son Jupiter\r\nput five in the 2:30 list; Andrew Jackson Jr., two; Mohawk, three;\r\nNonpareil, two; Plow Boy, one; and Vernol’s Black Hawk, one; to which we\r\nmay add the fact that this last named was the sire of the famous Iowa\r\nstallion, Green’s Bashaw. Although his life was not long and his stud\r\ncareer was probably up to the average, it cannot be said that he was a\r\ngreat progenitor of trotters.\r\n\r\nHENRY CLAY, the nominal head of the tribe that has taken his name, was a\r\nblack horse, foaled 1837, got by Andrew Jackson, son of Young Bashaw; and\r\nhis dam was Surrey, or Lady Surrey, as she is sometimes called, a pacing\r\nmare that was brought from Surrey, New Hampshire, to New York, and was\r\nconverted to a trotter, or possibly she may have been double-gaited from\r\nher birth. It has been generally stated in years past that this mare\r\nwas brought from Canada, and as there have been many disputes about her\r\norigin, I will try to give what authentic knowledge we have concerning\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMr. Peter W. Jones, one of the “old-time” horsemen and a very reliable\r\nman, said that David W. Gilmore, formerly a grocer at City Hall Place\r\nand Pearl Street, New York, bought a pacing mare, five years old, of\r\nMark D. Perkins, of Mount Vernon, New Hampshire, which came from Surrey,\r\nNew Hampshire, and hence her name “Lady Surrey.” Gilmore rode her to\r\nNew York, with a young man named Lovejoy. He gave less than one hundred\r\ndollars for her. She was a superior saddle mare, and as Mr. Gilmore\r\nappreciated horseback riding he bought her for that purpose. Frank\r\nGilmore, who was a deputy sheriff under Sheriff Orser, of New York, said\r\nthat Lady Surrey was the mare his brother rode from New Hampshire, and\r\nafter he sold her she turned out to be a trotter.\r\n\r\nThis is the story as told by Mr. Jones, and judging from its source I\r\nhave no doubt it is substantially correct. This leaves us without any\r\nknowledge whatever of the blood of the mare, but only that she was both\r\na pacer and a trotter. She was engaged in some races and was quite well\r\nknown to the trotting men of that day, and she must have been a pretty\r\ngood one to have been owned by such a horseman as George M. Patchen and\r\nby him bred to Andrew Jackson. It is said Surrey and Sally Miller were\r\ncoupled with Andrew Jackson the same day; they both stood, and the one\r\nproduced Henry Clay and the other Long Island Black Hawk.\r\n\r\nWhile Henry Clay remained the property of his breeder he was trained and\r\nwas looked upon as a promising young horse, but I have not been able to\r\ndetermine what rate of speed he was able to show. He certainly did not\r\nstand anywhere near the fastest, and he does not appear to have ever\r\nwon a race, and perhaps never started in one. Still, he was esteemed as\r\none of the best horses on Long Island and was liberally supported while\r\nthere. When about eight years old he was sold for a fine price to General\r\nWadsworth, of Livingston County, New York, and he was kept at various\r\npoints in that part of the State till he died of old age and neglect in\r\n1867. He came into the world when trotters were few and he lived till\r\nthey were many. He left a numerous progeny, but as the sire of trotters\r\nhe was a pronounced failure. In examining the 2:30 list I find a single\r\none of his get, before he left Long Island, with a single heat of even\r\n2:30. And in examining the list of his get during the twenty-odd years\r\nof his life in Western New York, I find a single representative, with a\r\nsingle heat in even 2:30, and this one was out of a mare by old Champion,\r\na very noted trotting progenitor. He left three sons that appear as\r\nsires: Andy Johnson, with three just inside of the 2:30 list, Henry\r\nClay Jr., with a single one to his credit, and Cassius M. Clay, with\r\none very fast one to his credit. This Cassius M. Clay was the sire of\r\nthe famous George M. Patchen. Three of Henry Clay’s daughters produced\r\nsix 2:30 trotters, and for a time it was held that the dam of the very\r\nfamous George Wilkes was a daughter of his, but that claim has not been\r\nsustained by later developments.\r\n\r\nThe name and memory of the horse Henry Clay would have been perpetuated\r\nin horse history through an attenuated line of descendants, as a fairly\r\ngood horse, though unsuccessful as a trotting progenitor, had his\r\nbones been left to rest and rot where they were buried. Unfortunately,\r\nabout the time of his death, there sprang up a most voluble enthusiast\r\nwhose special mission on earth seemed to be to extol the superlative\r\ngreatness of Henry Clay, and the contemptible worthlessness of “Bill\r\nRysdyk’s bull,” as he designated Hambletonian. He commenced pouring his\r\nendless contributions into the columns of the breeding press and writing\r\ninterminable letters to as many prominent breeders as would receive them,\r\nand all about the Clay blood being the only blood from which the trotter\r\ncould be bred. These effusions were written with some skill, abounding\r\nin great prodigality of fancy and still greater economy of truth. It was\r\nastonishing how many men believed what he said and how few understood\r\nthat the “old man” was in it as a “business.” He had gathered up all\r\nthe cheap sons of the old horse and wanted to sell them at a handsome\r\nadvance, and for a time the game won.\r\n\r\nTo keep the interest from falling off and the Clay blood moving, he\r\nsecured access to the purses of two wealthy gentlemen who were possessors\r\nand admirers of Clay blood, and the bones of the horse were taken up,\r\nmounted and set up, and presented to the United States National Museum at\r\nWashington, D. C. The bones are still there, and the inscription on the\r\npedestal when last seen was as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The progenitor of the entire family of Clay Horses, and the\r\n    foundation of the American Trotting Horse.”\r\n\r\nThen follow the names of the two gentlemen who presented the bones to\r\nthe Museum, but as a kindness to them their names are omitted. The first\r\nclause of the inscription is true, but the second is not true, and I very\r\nseriously doubt whether they ever authorized the second clause. Henry\r\nClay was not the “foundation” of anything, except the airy fabric of a\r\nfortune for our enthusiast. The scheme as an advertising dodge was well\r\nworked, and the schemer could well exclaim, “Where now is Bill Rysdyk’s\r\nbull?” In the nature of things such shams cannot last; this one had its\r\nfleeting day, and in the end the sheriff sold its worthless accumulations.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS M. CLAY.—This son of Henry Clay was quite a large bay horse,\r\ntaking his color and much of his shape from his dam. He was foaled\r\n1843, and his dam, Jersey Kate, was the dam of the trotting horse John\r\nAnderson. Jersey Kate was a bay, about fifteen hands three inches high,\r\nwith a clean, bony head, long neck, well set up, and when in driving\r\ncondition was a little high on her legs. She was used in livery work,\r\nand when a good and fast driver was wanted, Jersey Kate was always in\r\ndemand. In the same stable a pair of “Canuck” ponies were kept that\r\nwere driven in a delivery wagon. They were duns with white manes and\r\ntails and about fourteen and one-half hands high, quick steppers with\r\nno speed. One of them slipped his halter one night and got Jersey Kate\r\nwith foal. While she was carrying this foal she became the property of\r\nMr. Z. B. Van Wyck’s father, and when she had dropped her colt and was\r\nput to farm work it was found that she was too rapid and spirited for\r\nhis other horses, and he sold her to Joseph Oliver, of Brooklyn. The\r\ncolt she dropped was weaned before the sale of the dam and remained in\r\nthe family till he grew up. He was a grey, a little below fifteen hands,\r\nand as the boy, Z. B. Van Wyck, had broken and ridden him he got it into\r\nhis head that he would make a trotter, so he bought him from his father\r\nfor eighty dollars. He continued to improve and he sold him to Timothy\r\nT. Jackson and he to Charles Carman, who trotted him in many races. When\r\nMr. Oliver, then owner of Jersey Kate, saw her “catch” colt by a “Canuck”\r\npony able to beat many of the good ones on the island, he concluded\r\nto breed her to Mr. Patchen’s horse, Henry Clay, and the produce was\r\nCassius M. Clay. From her appearance, form, and especially her action,\r\nit was the universal opinion she was by Mambrino, son of Messenger, and\r\nit is probable she was, but in the absence of proof she must be classed\r\nas “breeding unknown.” Had it not been for the speed of little John\r\nAnderson, there would not have been any Cassius M. Clay.\r\n\r\nWhen the colt grew up, Mr. Oliver, his breeder, sold him to Mr. George\r\nM. Patchen, of Brooklyn, and he became a very popular stallion. After\r\nthe death of Kemble Jackson and Long Island Black Hawk he was considered\r\nthe best trotting stallion on Long Island. He was in a good many races,\r\nsome of which were reported, but more that were not, and as against\r\nstallions, he was with the fastest. In temper he was disposed to be\r\nvicious and had to be watched. In form he could not be considered\r\nbeautiful, but powerful. When the artist was modeling the equestrian\r\nstatue of Washington that stands in Union Square, he had a great search\r\nfor a horse to serve as a model, and he selected Cassius M. Clay as the\r\nbest representative of majesty and power that he could find. Although the\r\nbronze is of heroic size, it is, no doubt, a fair representation of the\r\noutline and structure of the horse. He died at Montgomery, Orange County,\r\nNew York, July, 1854, in the same stable where Long Island Black Hawk\r\nhad died four years before. The three great horses, Long Island Black\r\nHawk, Kemble Jackson and Cassius M. Clay, died just as they entered on\r\nwhat should have been the period of their greatest usefulness, the first\r\nat the age of thirteen; the second at the age of nine; and the third at\r\nthe age of eleven. If these horses had lived through the usual period of\r\nhorse life, doubtless the records of performers would bear very different\r\nrelations from what they do to-day, but the _really great sire_ had not\r\nyet made his appearance.\r\n\r\nConsidering the short period Cassius M. Clay was in the stud he left\r\na numerous progeny, but only one of them, George M. Patchen, achieved\r\ngreatness on the turf. He placed thirty-four heats in 2:30 or better to\r\nhis credit and made a record of 2:23½ in 1860, which was the fastest for\r\nany stallion of his day. This was the only one in the 2:30 list from the\r\nloins of Cassius M. Clay. Nine of his sons became the sires of eighteen\r\ntrotters, and more than a dozen of his sons were named “Cassius M. Clay\r\nJr.” thus leading to great confusion and oftentimes uncertainty as to\r\nidentity.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS M. CLAY JR. (NEAVE’S).—This was a brown horse foaled 1848, got by\r\nCassius M. Clay; dam by Chancellor, son of Mambrino; grandam by Engineer,\r\nsire of Lady Suffolk. He was bred by Charles Mitchell, of Manhasset, Long\r\nIsland, owned by Joseph Godwin, New York; stood in Orange County, 1852,\r\nin Dutchess, 1853, and was taken to Cincinnati that fall. He was owned by\r\nMr. Neave, made a few seasons, broke his leg in the hands of Mr. McKelvy,\r\nand had to be destroyed. Mr. Godwin represented this horse to me as very\r\nfast until four years old, when by an accident he was thrown into the\r\nHarlem River when hot and was stiff ever afterward. He put four of his\r\nget into the 2:30 list, and four of his sons got ten trotters and one\r\npacer. His early death was esteemed a great loss, for he was better bred\r\nthan most of the other sons of his sire.\r\n\r\nCLAY PILOT, by Cassius M. Clay (Neave’s), was out of a catch filly,\r\nwhose dam was the famous Kate, the grandam of Almont. From the noted\r\nold trotting mare Belle of Wabash, whose history will be found in\r\nChapter XXX. on the investigation of pedigrees, Clay Pilot got The Moor,\r\nhimself a fast trotter and a successful sire. He died at ten years old,\r\nleaving among others the famous Beautiful Bells, 2:29½, that, mated with\r\nElectioneer, produced a remarkable family; and Sultan, 2:24, sire of\r\nthe great Stamboul, 2:07½, and of thirty-eight other performers, and of\r\nthirteen producing sons and twenty producing daughters. The Moor founded\r\nan excellent family.\r\n\r\nFrom a sister to Crabtree Bellfounder, by imported Bellfounder, Neave’s\r\nCassius M. Clay got the black stallion Harry Clay, 2:29, that was quite a\r\nreputable trotter in his day, and left five standard performers, sixteen\r\nproducing sons and twenty-three producing daughters, among the latter the\r\nfamous Green Mountain Maid, the dam of Electioneer.\r\n\r\nCASSIUS M. CLAY JR. (STRADER’S).—This was a handsome brown horse,\r\nfoaled 1852, by the original Cassius, and his dam was a black mare by\r\nAbdallah, that passed through the hands of A. Van Cortlandt and afterward\r\nbecame the property of Joseph Godwin; grandam by Lawrence’s Eclipse;\r\ngreat-grandam the Charles Hadley mare by imported Messenger. This\r\npedigree has been questioned without assigning any reasons or facts, but\r\nas it came to me circumstantially and from unquestionable sources I have\r\nno reason to doubt it. He was bred by Joseph H. Godwin, of New York, and\r\nfoaled the property of Dr. Spaulding, of Greenupsburg, Kentucky. He made\r\nsome seasons in the hands of Dr. Herr, of Lexington, Kentucky, was bought\r\n1868 by R. S. Strader, and passed to General W. T. Withers, of Lexington,\r\nwhere he died 1882. He was engaged in several races and made a record of\r\n2:35¼. He put four in the 2:30 list, and he left sixteen sons that were\r\nthe sires of forty-six trotters and seven pacers. His daughters have\r\nproduced well, thirty-four of them having produced forty-two trotters and\r\nseven pacers. This shows him to have been a better horse than his sire\r\nand better than any of the other sons of his sire.\r\n\r\nGEORGE M. PATCHEN was a large bay horse, fully sixteen hands high and\r\nheavily proportioned. He was bred by H. F. Sickles, Monmouth County, New\r\nJersey, for Richard F. Carman, of New York, the owner of his dam. He was\r\ngot by the original Cassius M. Clay, and his dam was a light chestnut\r\nmare, owned and driven on the road by Mr. Carman. As the blood and origin\r\nof this mare was for many years unknown, it is necessary to go into some\r\nparticulars concerning it. From 1835 two brothers, Thomas and Richard\r\nTone, were contractors on the streets in the northern part of New York\r\nCity. Two or three years afterward Richard bought or traded for a large,\r\nstrong sorrel mare to work in one of their dirt carts. It was represented\r\nthat she had lost a foal shortly before and she was thin in flesh and\r\nlooked coarse. When she moved out of a walk she always went into a pace,\r\nand that seemed to be her natural gait. They kept this mare at work in\r\nthe cart for several years and sometimes turned her out to pasture in a\r\nsmall field at the foot of “Break-neck” hill, adjoining a pasture owned\r\nby the Bradhurst family. One morning a two-year-old stallion colt, owned\r\nby Samuel Bradhurst, was found in the pasture with the big pacing mare.\r\nHe had broken down the fence between the two pastures and gotten the big\r\nmare with foal. In due time she dropped a light chestnut filly, and when\r\nweaned, Thomas Tone bought this filly from his brother Richard, and at\r\ntwo years old commenced working her to his wagon. She had very severe\r\ntreatment for so young an animal and went amiss, when Thomas sold her\r\nto James Scanlon, a blacksmith, and after a time he sold her to Richard\r\nF. Carman for a driving mare. Like her dam, when she started off she\r\nwould pace, but after going some distance she would strike a trot and\r\ngo very fast. Mr. Carman paid one hundred dollars for her and he drove\r\nher beside another that he paid fifteen hundred for, and his fast daily\r\ndrives from Carmanville down to the city soon tested the respective\r\nmerits of the two mares. The hundred-dollar mare could outlast the other\r\nand had to help her along toward the end of the drive. In time she was\r\nfoundered and permanently stiffened and that was the reason she was sent\r\nto Mr. Sickles to be bred.\r\n\r\nWe must now look after the two-year-old colt that was the sire of this\r\nmare. Robert L. Stevens, of Hoboken, owned the famous race mare, Betsey\r\nRansom, and with others he bred from her the two fillies, Itasca and\r\nFrolic. In 1837 these two mares were owned by Samuel Bradhurst, who\r\nmanifested a sporting disposition, very much against the wishes of\r\nhis father. In 1837 he bred these two mares to imported Trustee, then\r\nstanding at Union Course, Long Island, and the produce were Head’em\r\nand Fanny Ransom. It is not known what became of Fanny Ransom, but he\r\ncontinued to own Head’em for some years and ran him in 1841 at the Union\r\nCourse and beat the imported colt Baronet, by Spencer. There seems to\r\nbe no other trace of his running or his stud services. It was in 1840,\r\ntherefore, that he jumped the fence and in 1841 that the dam of George M.\r\nPatchen was foaled. George Canavan, Mr. Bradhurst’s coachman, says there\r\nwere no other foals of any description bred by Mr. Bradhurst. These facts\r\nwere gleaned personally and separately from Tone and Canavan, and as they\r\ncomplement and sustain each other, they must be accepted as the best\r\ninformation extant on the breeding of this great horse. His dam was by\r\nHead’em, a son of Trustee, out of a mare by American Eclipse, a grandson\r\nof Messenger, and she was a pacer and a trotter. His grandam was a pacer\r\nof unknown breeding.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 he was purchased for four hundred dollars from Mr. Sickles by\r\nJohn Buckley, of Bordentown, New Jersey, and a few months afterward he\r\nsold a half interest in him to Dr. Longstreet, of the same place, and he\r\nremained their joint property till 1858, when Mr. Buckley sold his half\r\ninterest to Mr. Joseph Hall, of Rochester, New York. He commenced his\r\nremarkable career on the turf in 1855 and it continued till 1863. In 1858\r\nhe was engaged in the first race that gave him a national reputation.\r\nThis was against no less a celebrity than Ethan Allen, and he was\r\ndistanced, leaving Ethan with a clear title to the stallion championship.\r\nIn 1860 he turned the tables on his old rival and beat him in straight\r\nheats in 2:25, 2:24, 2:29. The next week the contest was renewed and\r\nPatchen again won in straight heats, and this gave him the unchallenged\r\nright to the rank of the fastest trotting stallion in the world. His\r\ntriumphs, however, were as wide as the trotting turf and not limited to\r\nsex. He was able to beat and did beat all the best but the indomitable\r\nlittle Flora Temple, and although he beat her twice, she was too fast for\r\nhim and beat him many times. It is not my purpose to give a history of\r\nhis achievements. It is sufficient to say he made a record of 2:23½, with\r\nthirty-four heats to his credit in 2:30 and less, and two miles in 4:51½.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that he was a very great success in the stud as we now\r\nmeasure success. Four of his get were able to enter the 2:30 list, and\r\namong them was the great Lucy, with her record of 2:18¼. Fifteen of his\r\nsons became the sires of sixty-two trotters and three pacers, and four\r\nof his daughters produced five trotters. It is hardly fair to compare\r\nthe stud services of a horse of Patchen’s generation with many of the\r\ngreat sons of Hambletonian, but at the same time we must not forget that\r\nPatchen was foaled the same year as Hambletonian. On the first of May,\r\n1864, when Dan Pfifer was preparing him for the racing season then about\r\nto open, he died of a rupture, just as his sire had died.\r\n\r\nGEORGE M. PATCHEN JR. (California Patchen) was a bay horse by the\r\nforegoing; dam Belle by Top Bellfounder, a grandson of imported\r\nBellfounder, of which little is known. He was bred by Joseph Regan, Mount\r\nHolly, New Jersey, and taken to California 1862 by William Hendrickson;\r\nreturned to New York 1866, sold to Messrs. Halstead, Poughkeepsie, 1867,\r\nand by them to W. A. Matthews in 1869, and taken to San Jose, California;\r\nthen sold to P. A. Finnegan, of San Francisco, and died the property\r\nof J. B. Haggin, Sacramento, 1887. He was campaigned quite extensively\r\nduring the years 1866 and 1867 in the East, and carried away a good share\r\nof the winnings from the best. His best record was 2:27. In the stud he\r\nwas more successful than his sire, which may be accounted for by his\r\nmore numerous progeny and his longer life. From his own loins he put ten\r\ntrotters into the 2:30 list, and, although there was no Lucy among them,\r\nWells Fargo made a record of 2:18¾; Sam Purdy, 2:20½; Vanderlyn, 2:21,\r\netc., showing a better average than the get of his sire. Ten of his sons\r\ngot twenty-three trotters and two pacers, and eleven of his daughters\r\nproduced twenty-five trotters and three pacers.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the other sons of George M. Patchen left valuable and fast\r\ntrotting progeny, and among them I will name Godfrey Patchen, with nine\r\ntrotters to his credit and his descendants breeding on; Henry B. Patchen,\r\nwith seven to his credit; Seneca Patchen, with sixteen trotters and one\r\npacer to his credit, perhaps more than he is honestly entitled to; Wild\r\nWagoner, with four to his credit; and Tom Patchen with three and his\r\nfamily transmitting speed.\r\n\r\nIn considering the founders of the Clay family, there are two or three\r\nimportant facts that should be kept in view, bearing upon the growth, or\r\nthe decadence of the family. In a breeding sense this appears to be the\r\nlongest line of _developed_ speed that we have in any of our trotting\r\nfamilies. While we know that there were developed trotters and pacers\r\nmany years before Abdallah and Andrew Jackson were foaled, we are not\r\nable to connect them in lines of descent, generation after generation.\r\nAs Andrew Jackson with his developed speed stands at the head of this\r\nline, the question naturally arises, Where did he get his ability to\r\ntrot? The only answer we can give is, from the daughter of Messenger that\r\nwas the grandam of his sire, and from the fast pacer, Charcoal Sal, that\r\nproduced him. Even if we accept the pedigree of Young Bashaw, with his\r\nMessenger grandam, when we get to Andrew Jackson we are a long way from\r\nthe Messenger source of trotting speed; hence, we must look to the pacing\r\nspeed of his dam—Charcoal Sal from Ohio—as the more probable source.\r\n\r\nAndrew Jackson was bred upon the converted pacer Surrey, and produced\r\nHenry Clay, then Henry Clay was bred upon Jersey Kate, of unknown blood,\r\nbut a producer of trotting speed, and produced Cassius M. Clay. Then\r\nCassius M. Clay was bred upon a mare “full of Messenger blood” and\r\nproduced Strader’s Cassius M. Clay—the best of the Clay name by the\r\nrecord. Cassius M. Clay (the original) was also bred on “Dick Carman’s\r\nmare” and produced the famous George M. Patchen. This Carman mare was by\r\na running-bred son of Trustee. She was both a pacer and a trotter and her\r\ndam was a natural pacer. George M. Patchen was bred on the Regan mare\r\nand produced California Patchen. This mare was, practically, of unknown\r\nbreeding. California Patchen was bred on Whiskey Jane and the produce\r\nwas his best son, Sam Purdy. This mare Whiskey Jane was quite a trotter\r\nand she was undoubtedly pacing bred, but I will not here enter into the\r\ndetails of her origin.\r\n\r\nWe have here before us a condensed view of the trotting inheritance of\r\nthe Clay and the Patchen families from Andrew Jackson to Sam Purdy, and\r\nits most remarkable feature is its poverty in recognized trotting blood.\r\nOn the maternal side, the pacing habit of action seems to prevail in\r\nalmost every succeeding generation. The second thought is that the tribe\r\nhas not held its vantage ground of the first and the longest line of\r\ndeveloped trotting speed. The third is that it has failed to transmit\r\nspeed with uniformity, but rather sporadically. This may be accounted\r\nfor by the general character and uncertainty of the maternal side, and\r\nsuggests the question whether animals so bred can be relied upon to\r\ntransmit with uniformity an inheritance received sporadically. From its\r\nplace in the first rank as to time and popularity, this family has not\r\nbeen able to hold its own and it has declined to a place among the minor\r\nfamilies of trotters and bids fair to be absorbed by tribes of stronger\r\ntrotting inheritance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN STAR, PILOT, CHAMPION, AND NORMAN FAMILIES.\r\n\r\n    Seely’s American Star—His fictitious pedigree—Breeding\r\n    really unknown—A trotter of some merit—His stud career—His\r\n    daughters noted brood mares— Conklin’s American Star—Old Pacing\r\n    Pilot—History and probable origin —Pilot Jr.—Pedigree—Training\r\n    and races—Prepotency—Family statistics summarized—Grinnell’s\r\n    Champion, son of Almack—His sons and performing\r\n    descendants—Alexander’s Norman and his sire, the Morse Horse—\r\n    Swigert and Blackwood.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the hundreds of difficult and obscure pedigrees that I have\r\nundertaken to investigate and straighten out, I have given more time,\r\nlabor and money to that of Seely’s American Star than to any other\r\nhorse. In 1867 I got his pedigree from a gentleman in Morris County,\r\nNew Jersey, who claimed to have bred him, and this pedigree and the\r\nhistory accompanying it embracing several details that were interesting,\r\nI published it, at full length, in the _Spirit of the Times_. This\r\nrepresented the horse as a light chestnut about fifteen hands high, with\r\nstar and snip and two white hind feet. He was represented to have been\r\nfoaled 1837 and to be by a horse called American Star, son of Cock of the\r\nRock, by Duroc; dam Sally Slouch by Henry, the race horse; grandam by\r\nimported Messenger. As there was no horse of that name, so far as I knew,\r\nby Cock of the Rock, but as there was one of that name by Duroc, I wrote\r\nto know whether this was not the breeding of the sire, and the answer\r\ncame that it might have been so.\r\n\r\nAfter the appearance of this pedigree in the “Register” I was greatly\r\nsurprised that nobody believed it, and the more a horseman knew of the\r\nhorse and his history the more positive he was that it was a mistake.\r\nSeveral years passed away, and while I kept insisting it was true, the\r\nunbelievers became more persistent than ever in their opposition to the\r\npedigree. The consensus of the opinions of horsemen seemed to be that the\r\nhorse was part “Canuck,” and this was the view held by his owner, Edmund\r\nSeely, as long as he lived. At last the following story came to me from\r\ndifferent responsible persons, all of whom were personally cognizant\r\nof the facts they related, as follows: On a certain occasion a street\r\ncontractor had a force at work, grading with shovels and carts, near\r\nthe foot of Twenty-third Street, I think, New York City. Among the cart\r\nhorses there was a Canadian stallion and a frisky, high-strung bay mare\r\nthat wouldn’t work kindly. One day during the noon hour, the “boys” for\r\namusement brought this stallion and mare together and in due time the\r\nmare proved to be with foal, and she was sent over to Jersey the next\r\nspring. The foal she there dropped was Seely’s American Star. When I\r\nasked to whom the mare had been sent to be taken care of, the answer came\r\nback quickly naming the same man whom I had represented as the breeder.\r\nAs the contractor had no use for the colt, as a matter of course, the\r\nkeeper of the mare would take the colt for the keeping. There is nothing\r\nunnatural nor unreasonable in this story, and it bears a pretty strong\r\nresemblance to the way the dam of the famous George M. Patchen came into\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nWhen the horse was four or five years old he began to show a fine\r\ntrotting step and he was sold to John Blauvelt, of New York, for a\r\ndriving horse. His feet not being strong, in the course of a year or two\r\nhe developed a couple of quarter cracks and he was sent back to the man\r\nwho raised him to be cured. In the winter of 1844-5 he was sold to Cyrus\r\nDubois, of Ulster County, New York, who kept him in the stud the seasons\r\nof 1845, 1846 and 1847. His advertisement for the year 1847 reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “American Star is a chestnut sorrel, eight years old on the\r\n    11th day of April, 1847, near 16 hands high, etc.... He was\r\n    sired by the noted trotting horse Mingo, of Long Island, who\r\n    was got by old Eclipse. American Star’s dam, Lady Clinton, the\r\n    well-known trotting mare of New Jersey, was sired by Sir Henry.”\r\n\r\nHere we have the third pedigree of this horse, and now the question\r\narises, Where did this pedigree come from? Cyrus Dubois is dead, but\r\na living brother of his says this is the pedigree that Cyrus brought\r\nwith the horse from New Jersey. As this same quasi-breeder was the man\r\nwho delivered the horse to Dubois, the statement of the living brother\r\ncomes very near proving that the first and the third of the pedigrees\r\nhere given were the work of the same man. Again, in 1844, this same\r\nquasi-breeder kept this horse at Warwick and New Milford, in Orange\r\nCounty, New York, and nobody in that region seems to have ever heard of\r\neither of these pedigrees. And again, this quasi-breeder wrote me that\r\nafter Edmund Seely had brought the horse to Goshen he went to see him,\r\nand after fully identifying him as the same horse he had bred he gave the\r\npedigree to Mr. Seely as he had given it to me. If this be true it is a\r\nvery strange thing that Mr. Seely never seemed to know anything about\r\nit, but persisted in giving the pedigree as by a Canadian horse and out\r\nof a mare by Henry. Upon the whole, I long ago concluded that my first\r\nand earliest correspondent on the question of American Star’s origin was\r\nunfortunate in having a mental organization that placed him “long” on the\r\nideal, and “short” on the real.\r\n\r\nHis stud services may be summarized as follows: In 1844 he was kept at\r\nWarwick and New Milford, Orange County, New York. In 1845, 1846 and 1847\r\nhe was in Ulster County, and on the borders of Orange. In 1848 and 1849\r\nhe was at Hillsdale, Columbia County, New York. In 1850, 1851, 1852 and\r\n1853 he was at Goshen and other points in Orange County. In 1854 he was\r\nat Elmira, New York. In 1855, it is said on good authority, he was kept\r\nten miles below Hudson. Others say he was at Piermont, Rockland County,\r\nthat year. In 1856 he was at Mendota, Illinois. In 1857, 1859 and 1860 he\r\nwas again in Goshen. In February, 1861, he died at Goshen, the property\r\nof Theodore Dusenbury. In Orange County his service fee ranged from ten\r\nto twenty dollars, and at last twenty-five dollars, and he was liberally\r\npatronized. An unusually large percentage of his foals were fillies, and\r\nhe was essentially a brood-mare sire from the start. Opinions differ very\r\nwidely among horsemen as to his capacity for speed, some maintaining that\r\nhe could trot in 2:35 while others insisted on placing him ten seconds\r\nslower. In trying to harmonize these conflicting views it is probably\r\nsafe to conclude that, when fit, which seldom occurred in his whole life,\r\nhis speed was about 2:40. He was always a cripple from defective feet\r\nand limbs, and his whole progeny were more or less subject to the same\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nHe left four trotters that barely managed to get inside the 2:30 list\r\nand eight sons that put sixteen inside of the list. But his strong point\r\nwas in the producing character of his daughters. Thirty-six of these\r\ndaughters left forty-five of their produce inside of 2:30. The disparity\r\nin the producing power of the sexes in this family is very remarkable\r\nand, in a breeding sense, very instructive. In the light of what has\r\nbeen developed in this family in the past fifty years, we are certainly\r\nready to form a safe estimate of its value as a factor in the combination\r\nthat goes to make up a breed of trotters. Star mares gave us a Dexter\r\nand a Nettie, and all the world thought that was the blood that was to\r\nlive on and on in the new breed. But, while Hambletonian was able to get\r\ngreat trotters from Star mares, he was not able to get, through their\r\nattenuated trotting inheritance, sons that would be as great as himself.\r\nTo his cover Star mares produced no such great sires as George Wilkes,\r\nElectioneer, Egbert, Happy Medium, and Strathmore. In the instances of\r\nDictator and Aberdeen there was a reasonable measure of success, but all\r\nthe others—and there were many of them—proved comparative failures. There\r\nis a lesson taught here that any one can interpret.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN STAR (CONKLIN’S) was a chestnut horse, foaled 1851, and got\r\nby Seely’s American Star, and his dam has been variously represented,\r\nwith nothing established as to her blood. He was bred by a Mr. Randall,\r\nof Orange County, and was among the first from his sire to attract\r\nattention. He came into the hands of E. K. Conklin when young, and was\r\ntaken by him to Philadelphia, and was owned by him during his lifetime.\r\nHe gave early promise of making a trotter, and from 1865 to 1868 he was\r\non the turf, more or less, and left a record of 2:33. His stud services\r\nwere confined to the region of Philadelphia till the year 1872, when he\r\nwas taken back to Orange County and died there. Three of his get entered\r\nthe 2:30 list; two of his sons got one trotter each and four or five of\r\nhis daughters produced one each.\r\n\r\nAt one time the name “American Star” was very popular, and quite a number\r\nof stallions were so named that were bogus; but his son Magnolia put\r\ntwo in the 2:30 list; one son got three trotters, and three daughters\r\nproduced five performers. His son Star of Catskill got two performers,\r\nand his son King Pharaoh got four pacers and all of them fast. The family\r\nhas not grown strong either in numbers or in merit. It has been carried,\r\nso far, by the influences of stronger blood, and it seems destined to\r\ncomplete absorption and extinction in more potent strains.\r\n\r\nPILOT, the head of the Pilot family, was a black pacing horse, and of\r\nlater years he has been generally designated as “Old Pacing Pilot.” He\r\nwas foaled about 1826, and nothing is known of his origin or his blood.\r\nFrom his make-up and appearance he was generally considered a Canadian,\r\nas was the custom at that time, and I think I have used this term\r\nmyself in referring to the horse, but there is really no foundation for\r\ncrediting him to that source. The earliest information we have of him\r\nis from an unpublished source, to the effect that he was well known to\r\ncertain sporting men about Covington, Kentucky. He next appears in New\r\nOrleans, hitched to a peddler’s cart, but really looking for a match as\r\na green pacer. To promote this object, Major Dubois, a sporting man, was\r\ntaken into the confidence of his owner, and it is said the horse showed\r\nhim a mile in 2:26 with one hundred and sixty-five pounds on his back,\r\nand the major bought him for one thousand dollars. In 1832 Dubois sold\r\nhim to Glasgow & Heinsohn, a livery stable firm of Louisville, Kentucky,\r\nand he remained the property of that firm till he died, about 1855. It\r\nhas been asserted with some semblance of authority that he could trot as\r\nwell as pace, but this seems to be wholly apocryphal, and on this point I\r\nam prepared to speak without hesitation or doubt. A large breeder in the\r\nvicinity of Louisville, whom I have learned to trust implicitly, through\r\nthe intercourse of many years, has assured me repeatedly that he knew\r\nthe horse and his master well, and that he had seen him very often, for\r\nyears, that he would not trot, and that his master could not make him\r\ntrot a step. On the occasion of a very deep fall of snow he was taken out\r\nto see whether that would not compel him to trot, and he went rolling and\r\ntumbling about with no more gait than a hobbled hog.\r\n\r\nHe left a numerous progeny, most of them pacers, with some trotters. We\r\nknow but little of their merits, as at that period pacing and trotting\r\nraces were carried on, generally, on guerrilla principles, and no records\r\nkept, except at a few of the more prominent occasions. His fastest pacer,\r\nprobably, was Bear Grass, and there is a little history here that will\r\nbe interesting further on. My late friend, Edmund Pearce, had always,\r\nfrom childhood, been a great admirer of the grand old saddle mare, Nancy\r\nTaylor. She had been bred to Old Pilot and produced a colt foal, which\r\nMr. Pearce bought when young and named him Bear Grass. This was the\r\nfirst piece of horseflesh he ever owned, and he didn’t think he had ever\r\nowned a better one. He was amazingly fast, and could go away from all\r\ncompetitors, but unfortunately an accident befell him that ended his\r\ncareer before he reached maturity. Bear Grass had a half-sister called\r\nNancy Pope, being the daughter of Nancy Taylor, that was afterward bred\r\nto Old Pilot, and she produced the famous Pilot Jr., that was the fastest\r\ntrotter from the loins of the old pacer. Pilot Jr. took the diagonal form\r\nof the trot from his dam and never paced. It is worthy of noting that\r\nNancy Taylor and Nancy Pope—mother and daughter—produced old Pilot’s\r\nfastest pacer and fastest trotter.\r\n\r\nPILOT JR. (ALEXANDER’S) was a grey horse, foaled 1844, “got by old Pacing\r\nPilot; dam Nancy Pope, grandam Nancy Taylor.” This is the literal version\r\nof his pedigree as given by his first owners and as given by W. J.\r\nBradley and others who had him in charge year after year in the region of\r\nLexington, according to the different advertisements, and no change ever\r\nappeared till the horse was bought and taken to Woodburn Farm. Then, for\r\nthe first time we learned that Nancy Pope was got by Havoc, thoroughbred\r\nson of Sir Charles, and that Nancy Taylor was got by Alfred, an imported\r\nhorse. This was not the work of Mr. R. A. Alexander, an honorable man,\r\nbut the work of the professional pedigree manufacturer, who exploited\r\nhis inventive skill very widely through the early catalogues of that\r\ngreat establishment. As a matter of historic fact, Pilot Jr.’s dam was\r\nNancy Pope, but nothing is known of her sire, and Nancy Pope was out of\r\nNancy Taylor, about whose pedigree nothing whatever is known. But as the\r\nsubject of Pilot Jr.’s pedigree is exhaustively treated in Chapter XXIX.,\r\nthe details need not be further dealt with here.\r\n\r\nThe training of Pilot Jr. commenced when he was five years old, and after\r\nthe close of his stud seasons he was kept at it, in a moderate way,\r\nfor several years, and it is said he never manifested any inclination\r\nto strike a pace. He was engaged in some races, and his advertisement\r\nclaims he won several, giving the names of horses he had beaten, but the\r\ntime made seems to be carefully avoided. He could probably trot in about\r\n2:50 or a little better. He and all his family, so far as I can learn,\r\nwere willful and hard to manage in their training, and were, therefore,\r\nin danger of becoming unreliable, but they were fast for their day, and\r\ndead game campaigners. There is one particular in which this horse seemed\r\nto surpass nearly all others and that was in his power to eliminate the\r\nrunning instinct and to plant the trotting instinct in his progeny from\r\nrunning-bred mares. It is doubtless true that many of those mares, so\r\nclassed, were only running bred on paper; but the fact still remains,\r\nand it is supported by a sufficient number of authentic instances, to\r\njustify the conclusion that his potency in this direction was remarkable.\r\n\r\nDuring the troublous times of the war many of his early progeny were\r\nlost or destroyed, but from his own loins he put eight performers in the\r\n2:30 list and others not far away. Six of his sons became the sires of\r\nforty-one performers, and eighteen of his daughters produced forty-one\r\nperformers. Although the official records do not show that Pilot Jr.\r\ngot any pacers, it is nevertheless true that he did get some very fast\r\nones. But when we get past the period when the pacer was considered a\r\nbastard and kept out of sight, we meet with some astonishing facts. As an\r\nexample, take Miss Russell, the greatest of all the Pilots. First, she\r\nproduced a pacer that was changed to the diagonal instead of the lateral\r\nstep, and then stood for years as the champion trotter of the world.\r\nSecond, her son Nutwood has placed twenty pacers in the 2:30 list; her\r\nson Mambrino Russell has placed five there, and her son Lord Russell has\r\nplaced five there. This brief and hasty exhibit of what the descendants\r\nof Miss Russell are doing seems to upset all the laws of heredity,\r\nprovided always that her dam was a thoroughbred mare. The evidence that\r\nthe breeding of this reputed “thoroughbred” mare is wholly unknown is\r\nconsidered in another part of this volume.\r\n\r\nIn a few odd instances, in the male lines of descent from Pilot Jr., the\r\ntrotting and pacing instinct seem to be transmitted in stronger measure\r\nthan in any of the other minor families, but the day of its submersion is\r\nnot far distant. The survival of the fittest is the law of Nature.\r\n\r\nCHAMPION, the head of the Champion family, was a beautiful golden\r\nchestnut, sixteen hands high and without marks. He was bred by George\r\nRaynor, of Huntington, Long Island, and was foaled 1842. He was got by\r\nAlmack, son of Mambrino, by Messenger; dam Spirit, by Engineer Second,\r\nson of Engineer, by Messenger, and sire of the famous Lady Suffolk. This\r\nis enough Messenger blood to please the most fastidious, but I think\r\nthere was still more beyond the Engineer mare. When eighteen months old\r\nthis colt showed phenomenal speed when led behind a sulky, and when\r\nthree years old he was driven a full mile to harness in 3:05, a rate of\r\nspeed which, at that time had never been equaled by a colt of that age.\r\nThis made him “champion” as a three-year-old and William T. Porter named\r\nhim Champion. After this performance Mr. John Sniffin, a merchant of\r\nBrooklyn, bought him, and in June, 1846, Mr. William R. Grinnell paid\r\ntwo thousand six hundred dollars for him and took him to Cayuga County,\r\nNew York. After keeping Champion in that county till the close of the\r\nseason of 1849, Mr. Grinnell concluded to sell the horse, as in all that\r\ntime he had not covered one hundred mares. Mr. Grinnell complained that\r\nthe farmers did not appreciate the horse, and many of them failed to pay\r\nfor his services. But the fault was not all on the part of the farmers,\r\nfor the price, to them, was very high, and he was a very uncertain foal\r\ngetter.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1850, he was sent to New York and kept in the stable of Mr.\r\nVan Cott, on the Harlem road. He had been very badly handled, and Mr.\r\nVan Cott says he had been abused and ill-treated, and when he came to\r\nhis place he was as vicious and savage as a wild beast. The horse was\r\nkept there for sale, and in his daily exercise Mr. Van Cott says he could\r\n“show considerably better than 2:40 at any time.” In 1851 he was sent\r\nover to Jersey and kept for public use at a fee of fifty dollars, by\r\nSamuel Taylor, at Newmarket, Metuchen, Boundbrook and Millstone. After\r\nmaking three or four seasons in the region of Boundbrook, in the year\r\n1854, Mr. Grinnell, who still owned him, sold him to Mr. James Harkness,\r\nof St. Louis, Missouri, for about seven hundred and fifty dollars. On\r\nreaching St. Louis he proved to be as dangerous as ever, and no man dared\r\nto go into his stall, except Mr. Harkness and one assistant. In 1858 Mr.\r\nHarkness sold him to Thomas T. Smith, of Independence, Missouri, for\r\none thousand dollars. He was there stolen by “jayhawkers” and taken to\r\nLeavenworth, Kansas, where he made two seasons and died 1864. Although he\r\nlived to be old, he left comparatively few colts, but a large proportion\r\nof that few were of excellent quality and many of them trotters.\r\n\r\nCHAMPION (SCOBEY’S also known as King’s Champion) was the best son of\r\nGrinnell’s Champion, the son of Almack, and he came out of a mare called\r\nBird, by Redbird, son of Billy Duroc. He was foaled 1849, and was bred\r\nby Jesse M. Davis, then of Cayuga County, New York, and sold to David\r\nKing, of Northville, New York, and by him in 1861 to Mr. Kellogg, of\r\nBattle Creek, Michigan. He was repurchased by Messrs. Backus, Scobey and\r\nBurlew in August, 1865, and soon became the property of Mr. C. Scobey\r\nand died his in May, 1874. It has been claimed this horse had speed and\r\na record of 2:42 in 1857, but I have no data to determine how fast he\r\nwas. From his own loins he put eight performers in the 2:30 list, two\r\nof which were phenomenally fast, although their records do not show it.\r\nHere I allude to Nettie Burlew and Sorrel Dapper, more generally known as\r\n“The Auburn Horse.” The latter was a long, leggy, light chestnut, with a\r\ntremendous stride, and Hiram Woodruff did not hesitate to say he was a\r\nfaster horse than Dexter. This Champion was a sire of excellent quality,\r\nalthough but a few of his progeny were developed. He left six sons that\r\nwere the sires of forty-four trotters, and seven daughters that produced\r\nnine performers.\r\n\r\nCHAMPION (GOODING’S) was a bright bay horse with black points, standing\r\nfifteen and three-quarter hands high. He was got by Scobey’s Champion,\r\ndam the trotting mare Cynthia, by Bartlett’s Turk, son of Weddle’s\r\nimported Turk; grandam Fanny, by Scobey’s Black Prince; great-grandam\r\nBett, by Rockplanter, son of Duroc; great-great-grandam Kate, represented\r\nto be a Messenger mare. He was foaled 1853, and was bred by Almeron Ott,\r\nCayuga County, New York, and traded to Mr. Stearns, from whom he passed\r\nto his late owners, T. W. and W. Gooding, Ontario County, New York. He\r\ndied June, 1883. This horse was peddled about in Seneca County at a fee\r\nof five dollars, and had a very light patronage among the farmers. At\r\nlast he was sold, with difficulty, at Canandaigua, for three hundred\r\ndollars to the Messrs. Gooding, and he brought them a handsome income as\r\nlong as he lived. As his reputation as a sire of speed spread abroad,\r\nthe quality of the mares brought to him improved, and among them were\r\nsome with good trotting inheritance. Of his progeny, seventeen entered\r\nthe 2:30 list, the fastest in 2:21, and they were good campaigners. It\r\nis a remarkable fact that only one of his sons proved himself a trotting\r\nsire, and he left but a single representative. On the female side of the\r\nhouse he was more successful, for six of his daughters produced seven\r\nperformers.\r\n\r\nCHARLEY B. was a bay horse, sixteen hands high, and was bred by Charles\r\nBurlew, of Union Springs, New York. He was foaled 1869, and was got by\r\nScobey’s Champion, son of Champion, by Almack, and proved himself the\r\nbest son of his sire. He was out of a mare well known as “Old Jane” that\r\nwas the dam of Myrtle with a record of 2:25½. Several pedigrees have\r\nbeen provided for this mare that did not prove reliable, and they were\r\nall careful to endow her with plenty of Messenger blood. After searching\r\nfor the facts through some years, the only version of it that seemed\r\nto be worthy of credence showed that her sire was a horse called Magnum\r\nBonum and there it ended. In his racing career this horse was started\r\nsometimes under the name of “Lark.” He has six heats to his credit\r\nin 2:30 and better, and a record of 2:25. From his own loins he has\r\ntwenty-two trotters in the 2:30 list. Considering the respectable number\r\nthis horse shows in the 2:30 list, his great nervous energy, his vigorous\r\nconstitution, and the number of years he was liberally patronized in\r\nthe stud, it is a most notable fact that he has but two sons that are\r\nproducers. Six of his daughters have produced. As a propagator of speed\r\nin the coming generations, this horse seems to be even a greater failure\r\nthan his half-brother, Gooding’s Champion.\r\n\r\nNIGHT HAWK was a chestnut son of Grinnell’s Champion. He was bred by\r\nJohn S. Van Kirk, of Newark, New Jersey, and his dam was by Sherman’s\r\nYoung Eclipse, son of American Eclipse. He was foaled 1855-6. In 1862\r\nMr. Van Kirk took him to Kalamazoo, Michigan, thence to Paw Paw in 1872,\r\nand in 1879 he was returned to Kalamazoo, owned by A. T. Tuthill. He\r\nwas something of a trotter, and had a record of 2:36, under the name of\r\nChampion, when he was controlled by Mr. D. B. Hibbard, I think. He was\r\nshown at a State fair, held at Lansing, on a poor half-mile track, it is\r\nsaid, and trotted a mile in 2:31¼, and for this performance he received\r\na piece of plate from the society testifying to this fact. He has but\r\ntwo representatives in the 2:30 list, and three of his sons have five\r\ntrotters to their credit, while six of his daughters have produced seven\r\nperformers. He lived to an old age.\r\n\r\nThe merits and demerits of this family are very marked. The head of it\r\nseems to have possessed great nerve force and an unmistakable instinct\r\nto trot, but he was irritable and vicious in his temper. Both these\r\nqualities—the desirable and the undesirable alike—he seems to have\r\ntransmitted to his offspring. I have seen Gooding’s Champion, and he had\r\nthe temper and disposition of his grandsire. It appears that the original\r\nChampion was a shy breeder, and I am disposed to think he inherited this\r\ninfirmity from his sire, Almack, and whether the inability of his sons\r\nand grandsons to get sires of trotters may be accounted for from this\r\ncause would be a very difficult question to answer. There are several\r\nothers of this family, East and West, that have single representatives in\r\nthe 2:30 list, that I have not enumerated, but from the statistics, as\r\nthey now stand, it seems probable that whatever is good in this family\r\nwill be swallowed up in other tribes that are more prepotent and positive\r\nin the trotting instinct.\r\n\r\nNORMAN, OR THE MORSE HORSE.—This horse was originally named “Norman,” but\r\nin later years he was more generally and widely known as The Morse Horse.\r\nHis family is not large, but some of his descendants have shown great\r\nspeed and great racing qualities. His origin and breeding as given below\r\nhave resulted from a wide and laborious correspondence, and, I think, can\r\nbe accepted as trustworthy. He was bred by James McNitt, of Hartford,\r\nWashington County, New York, who was a large farmer and distiller. He\r\nwas foaled 1834, got by European; dam Beck, by Harris’ Hambletonian;\r\ngrandam Mozza, by Peacock, son of imported Messenger. He was fifteen and\r\nthree-quarter hands high, a dark iron grey when young, and became white\r\nwith age. He had plenty of bone, was handsome and a natural trotter.\r\nSomething of the history of the animals entering into this pedigree is\r\nimportant and I will try to give it in as brief form as possible.\r\n\r\nThe breeder, Mr. McNitt, was in the habit of visiting Montreal at least\r\nonce a year with the products of his farm and his distillery. On one\r\noccasion he brought back three horses with him, two “Canucks” and a very\r\nelegant grey horse that he called European, that was evidently somewhat\r\nadvanced in years and was a little knee-sprung from the effects of\r\nhard driving. The two “Canucks” were fast trotters, but European could\r\nbeat either of them. Mr. McNitt represented that this horse had been\r\nimported into Canada from Normandy in France and doubtless he believed\r\nit, but there were none of the French characteristics about him. He was\r\npurchased in Montreal about 1829 and died in Washington County about\r\n1836. The dam and grandam of the Morse Horse were bred by Mr. Joseph T.\r\nMills, of the town of Argyle, in Washington County. Beck, the dam, was\r\na bright bay mare about sixteen hands high. At weaning time Mr. Mills\r\nsold her to Robert Stewart, of Greenwich, and at three years old he sold\r\nher to Mr. McNitt. She was got by Harris’ Hambletonian, when he was\r\nkept by John Williams, Jr. This is established quite satisfactorily and\r\ncircumstantially. Mozza, the dam of Beck, was a chestnut mare, without\r\nmarks, and was got by Peacock, a son of imported Messenger that was\r\nowned by Mr. Emerson in Saratoga County and was afterward burned up in\r\nhis stable. This son of Messenger, called Peacock, was entirely new to\r\nme when I was investigating this pedigree in 1876 and I was disposed\r\nto reject it, but Mr. Mills certainly had a horse of that name and he\r\nrepresented him to be a son of Messenger, and he probably was, but I do\r\nnot _know_ that he was so bred.\r\n\r\nMr. McNitt sold the colt at three years old to Martin Stover, who lived\r\non his place, for eighty dollars; the next year Stover sold him to James\r\nMills. In 1840 Mills sold him to Mr. Tefft and Zack Adams, and they sold\r\nhim not long after to Philip Allen and Calvin Morse, of White Creek. Mr.\r\nMorse had him a number of years and when old sold him to Mr. Grant, and\r\nhe died at Spiegletown in Renssalaer County, New York. He was a very\r\nperfect, natural trotter, and his speed was developed to some extent. In\r\nAugust, 1847 or 1848, Mr. Morse put him into the hands of John Case, of\r\nSaratoga Springs, the driver of Lady Moscow, to prepare him for the State\r\nFair, at which he expected to meet the famous Black Hawk. Mr. J. L. D.\r\nEyclesheimer, a very intelligent gentleman, formerly of the region of\r\nSaratoga, wrote that while the horse was in Case’s hands, he, with Mr.\r\nMorse, timed him a full mile in 2:40½. At the State Fair he was all out\r\nof fix and Black Hawk beat him in the second and third heats. He won the\r\nfirst heat in 2:52½. In the rivalries between stallions at agricultural\r\nfairs, however, is a very poor place to look for fair work and fair\r\njudgment, either from the stand or from the spectators.\r\n\r\nGENERAL TAYLOR was a grey horse, foaled 1847, got by the Morse Horse,\r\ndam the trotting mare Flora, a New York road mare of unknown breeding.\r\nHe was bred by the brothers Eyclesheimer, then of Pittstown, New York.\r\nHe was taken to Janesville, Wisconsin, 1850, and thence to California,\r\n1854, where he trotted thirty miles against time in one hour forty-seven\r\nminutes and fifty-nine seconds. He also beat New York a ten-mile race in\r\n29:41½. This horse has no representative in the 2:30 list, but his blood\r\nhas always been very highly esteemed in California for its speed, but\r\nmore especially for its game qualities. Honest Ance was another son of\r\nthe Morse Horse that did a great deal of racing in California, although\r\nhe has no record in the 2:30 list. He was a chestnut gelding, and was\r\nmanaged by the notorious Jim Eoff, who was always ready to win or to lose\r\nas the money seemed to suggest.\r\n\r\nNORMAN (ALEXANDER’S) was a brown horse, foaled about 1846, got by the\r\nMorse Horse, son of European; dam one of a pair of brown mares purchased\r\nby John N. Slocum of Samuel Slocum, a Quaker of Leroy, Jefferson County,\r\nNew York, and represented to be by Magnum Bonum. These mares passed to\r\nMr. Russell, and from him to Titcomb & Waldron, who bred the better of\r\nthe two to the Morse Horse, and the produce was Alexander’s Norman.\r\nThis colt passed through several hands till he reached Henry L. Barker,\r\nof Clinton, New York, and about 1860, he sold him to the late R. A.\r\nAlexander, of Woodburn Farm, Kentucky. He died 1878. The original version\r\nof this pedigree, as put upon Mr. Alexander and advertised by him, as\r\nwere many others, was wholly fictitious on the side of the dam. He\r\nwas not retained long at Woodburn Farm. He does not seem to have been\r\na uniform transmitter of speed, but when it did appear it was apt to\r\nbe of a high order. He left but two representatives in the 2:30 list,\r\nLula, 2:15, with fifty-six heats, and May Queen, 2:20, with twenty-five\r\nheats. He left four sons that became the sires of fifty-eight performers\r\nand thirteen daughters that produced nineteen performers. Such sons as\r\nSwigert and Blackwood speak well for his transmitting powers.\r\n\r\nSWIGERT was a brown horse, foaled 1866, got by Alexander’s Norman, son of\r\nthe Morse Horse; dam Blandina, by Mambrino Chief; grandam the Burch Mare,\r\nby Brown Pilot, son of Copper Bottom, pacer. He was bred at Woodburn\r\nFarm, Kentucky, and when young became the property of Richard Richards,\r\nof Racine, Wisconsin, where he remained many years and passed to F. J.\r\nAyres, of Burlington, Wisconsin. As a prepotent sire this horse stands\r\nhigh in the list of great horses. This may be accounted for in great\r\npart by the speed-producing qualities which he inherited from his dam.\r\nI am not informed as to the amount of training he may have had, nor of\r\nthe rate of speed he may have been able to show. He placed forty-four\r\ntrotters and two pacers in the 2:30 list. Thirty-three of his sons became\r\nthe sires of sixty-one trotters and fourteen pacers. Twenty-three of his\r\ndaughters produced twenty-one trotters and six pacers. From the number\r\nof his sons that have already shown their ability to get trotters, it is\r\nfair to presume that his name will be perpetuated. He died in 1892.\r\n\r\nBLACKWOOD was a black horse, foaled 1866, got by Alexander’s Norman, son\r\nof the Morse Horse; dam by Mambrino Chief; grandam a fast trotting dun\r\nmare, brought from Ohio, pedigree unknown. He was bred by D. Swigert,\r\nSpring Station, Kentucky, and foaled the property of Andrew Steele, of\r\nScott County, Kentucky. At five years old he was sold to John W. Conley,\r\nand by him to Harrison Durkee, of New York, and was afterward owned at\r\nTiconderoga, New York. He made a record of 2:31 when three years old,\r\nwhich, at that day, was considered phenomenal for a colt of that age. His\r\nopportunities in the stud were not of the best, but nine of his progeny\r\nentered the 2:30 list; eleven of his sons got twenty performers, and\r\ntwenty-five of his daughters produced thirty-seven performers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE BLUE BULL AND OTHER MINOR FAMILIES.\r\n\r\n    Blue Bull, the once leading sire—His lineage and history—His\r\n    family rank— The Cadmus family—Pocahontas—Smuggler—Tom\r\n    Rolfe—Young Rolfe and Nelson—The Tom Hal family—The various\r\n    Tom Hals—Brown Hal—The Kentucky Hunters—Flora Temple—Edwin\r\n    Forrest—The Drew Horse and his descendants—The Hiatogas.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE BULL, the real head of this family, was one of the most remarkable\r\nhorses that this or any other country has produced. He was a light\r\nchestnut, just a little over fifteen hands high, with one hind pastern\r\nwhite and a star in his forehead. He was strongly built and his limbs\r\nwere excellent, except perhaps a little light just below the knee. He\r\nwas foaled 1858 and died July 11, 1880. He was bred by Elijah Stone, of\r\nStone’s Crossing, Johnson County, Indiana. For a time he was owned by\r\nLewis Loder and Daniel Dorrel, before he passed into the hands of James\r\nWilson, of Rushville, Indiana, who kept him many years and whose property\r\nhe died. At one time he stood at the head of the list of all trotting\r\nsires in the world, and yet he could not trot a step himself, but he\r\ncould pace amazingly fast, and it was claimed he could pace a quarter in\r\nthirty seconds. He was the first and only horse that was ever able to\r\nsnatch the scepter from the great Hambletonian family, but after a brief\r\nreign of a couple of years he had to surrender it again to that family,\r\nwhere, from present appearances, it is destined to remain.\r\n\r\nThe breeding of this horse is very obscure, and after we have told all\r\nthat is known about it we will not have given very much information.\r\nHe was got by a large dun pacing horse that was known as Pruden’s Blue\r\nBull, and he by a blue roan horse known as Merring’s Blue Bull, or Ohio\r\nFarmer. The latter was taken to Butler County, Ohio, from Chester County,\r\nPennsylvania, and it has been said, without confirmation, that he was of\r\nChester Ball stock. He was a large, strong farm horse, a natural pacer,\r\nas were many of his progeny, and dun and roan colors were very prevalent\r\namong them. He died the property of Mr. Merring about 1843. His son,\r\nPruden’s Blue Bull, was of a dun color and a natural pacer, but his dam\r\nhas never been traced. He was large, strong, rather coarse, and had some\r\nreputation as a fast pacer, for a horse of his size, and his color was\r\nquite prevalent among his progeny. He was bred in Butler County, Ohio,\r\nand about 1853 was taken to Boone County, Kentucky. In 1861 he became the\r\nproperty of G. B. Loder, of the same county, and in 1863 he traded him to\r\nJames Pruden, of Elizabethtown, Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe pedigree of Wilson’s Blue Bull, the head of the family on the side\r\nof the dam, is equally unsatisfactory so far as the blood elements are\r\nconcerned. We know that this dam was called Queen, that she was bred by\r\nElijah Stone, and that she was got by a horse called Young Selim, but we\r\nknow nothing about Young Selim. We also know that the dam of Queen was\r\ncalled Bet, and that Mr. Stone bought her of Mr. Sedan, and there all\r\nknowledge ends. Since the days of the great racing progenitor, Godolphin\r\nArabian, of whose origin and blood nobody, living or dead, had a single\r\nshadow of knowledge, down to the day of Wilson’s Blue Bull, no horse\r\nequally obscure in his inheritance has ever been able to prove himself\r\nreally great as a progenitor of speed.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Blue Bull’s rising fame, and indeed till his death, there\r\nwas developed such a condition of muddled morals as one seldom meets with\r\nin a lifetime. Whenever a horse of unknown breeding, in any one of three\r\nor four States, began to show some speed, his owner at once called him\r\na Blue Bull, and if he went fast enough to enter the 2:30 list, he was\r\nat once credited to Blue Bull by his friends, and they were all ready\r\nto fight for it. If the books of Blue Bull’s services did not show that\r\nthe dam of the “unknown” had ever been within a hundred miles of that\r\nhorse, it was all the worse for the books. With a large number of men\r\ninterested financially in Blue Bull stock, ready to claim everything\r\nin sight and anxiously looking for something more to appear, it became\r\na most laborious task to keep this class of frauds out of the records.\r\nAnother cause of dissent and dissatisfaction among the “boomers” of Blue\r\nBull blood was the final discovery of the breeder in Elijah Stone and\r\nthat there was no “thoroughbred” blood in his veins. At that time a very\r\nlarge majority of the horsemen of the country honestly believed that all\r\nspeed, whether at the pace or the trot, must come from the gallop. It\r\nwas not the _truth_, therefore, that these people were looking for, but\r\nsomething to support that ignorant and stupid theory.\r\n\r\nA careful study of the statistics of this horse will teach a valuable\r\nlesson. He put fifty-six trotters into the 2:30 list, varying in speed\r\nfrom 2:30 to 2:17¼, and five of this number in 2:20 or better. He also\r\ngot four pacers with records from 2:24½ to 2:16¼. It thus appears that\r\nthis horse, without any known trotting blood, got fifty-four trotters\r\nto four pacers, which clearly shows that an inheritance of speed at the\r\npace may be transmitted at the trot, as well as the pace. When we come to\r\nhis progeny, we find that forty-seven of his sons have to their credit\r\none hundred and four performers, making an average of a little more\r\nthan two each. These sons are all past maturity and some of them dead\r\nof old age, and not one of them has ever reached mediocrity in merit as\r\na sire. He left seventy-seven daughters that have produced one hundred\r\nand seven performers, and if we had time to trace out these performers\r\nwe would find that they were generally by strains of blood stronger and\r\nbetter than the blood of Blue Bull. While, therefore, we can acknowledge\r\nBlue Bull’s greatness as a getter of speed from his own loins, we must\r\nacknowledge that his sons and daughters as the producers of speed are\r\nfailures. It is possible that some representative of the tribe may\r\nspring up and restore the prestige of the family, but as the source is\r\nsporadic and as the country is filled up with trotting elements that are\r\nmore prepotent, it is more likely to be swallowed up and lose its family\r\nidentity.\r\n\r\nCADMUS (known as Irons’ Cadmus) was the head of a very small family that\r\noccasionally developed phenomenal speed either at the pace or the trot.\r\nHe was a chestnut horse nearly sixteen hands high, strong and active,\r\nwith four white feet. He was foaled 1840 and was got by Cadmus, the\r\nthoroughbred son of American Eclipse, and was bred by Goldsmith Coffein,\r\nRed Lion, Warren County, Ohio. His dam was a chestnut pacing mare that\r\nMr. Coffein got in a trade, from a traveler, and nothing was ever known\r\nof her breeding. A pedigree was shaped up for her that seemed to make\r\nher thoroughbred and her son took a prize on it once, as a thoroughbred,\r\nbut it was wholly untrue. Mr. John Irons of the same county became joint\r\nowner in this horse, and he became widely known as “Irons’ Cadmus.” To\r\nclose this partnership he was sold, 1850, and taken to Richmond, Indiana;\r\nthen to George Shepher, of Butler County, Ohio, and next to a company in\r\nWheeling, West Virginia, where he made two seasons, and was sold to St.\r\nLouis, Missouri, and died without further service, in 1858. From birth\r\nhe was double-gaited, inclining more to the pace than to the trot. From\r\nunskillful handling his gaits became mixed up so that it was never known\r\nwhether he might have been able to show any speed or not.\r\n\r\nPocahontas, the pacer, was the most distinguished of his get, and if\r\nthere were no others of merit from her sire this one alone would be\r\nsufficient to command a place in the volume. She was a large, strong\r\nchestnut mare with four white legs, a white face, and a splotch of white\r\non her belly. She was bred by John C. Dine, of Butler County, Ohio, and\r\nwas foaled 1847. Her dam was a very strong mare got by Probasco’s Big\r\nShakespeare, a horse over sixteen hands and very heavily proportioned,\r\na very valuable farm horse with good action, many of whose tribe were\r\ndisposed to pace. The grandam was also a descendant of Valerius, that\r\nwas brought to Ohio from New Jersey. Pocahontas passed through several\r\nhands at very low prices and was used for all kinds of heavy farming and\r\nhauling until she reached the hands of L. D. Woodmansee, when her speed\r\nbegan to be developed. She was soon matched against Ben Higdon, the fast\r\npacing son of Abdallah, and beat him in 2:32. In December, 1853, she was\r\ntaken to New Orleans, and beat several celebrities there early the next\r\nspring. Before her last race it was discovered she was in foal, and some\r\ntwo months afterward she dropped Tom Rolfe. In the autumn of 1854 she was\r\nbrought to the Union Course, Long Island, and it was not till June, 1855,\r\nthat her owners and managers could get a match with her. At last Hero,\r\nthe famous son of Harris’ Hambletonian, met her for two thousand dollars,\r\nhe to harness and she to wagon. In the first heat she distanced the\r\ngelding in 2:17½, and it was maintained by her driver that she could have\r\ngone at least five seconds faster, if it had been necessary. For racing\r\npurposes she was no longer of any value, for nothing would start against\r\nher. She was then sold and became a brood mare at Boston, Massachusetts,\r\nand produced the sires Tom Rolfe and Strideway, Pocahontas, 2:26¾, and\r\nthe dams of May Morning, 2:30, and Nancy, 2:23½, thus ranking as a great\r\nbrood mare.\r\n\r\nShanghai Mary, that has become so famous as the dam of Green Mountain\r\nMaid, one of the very greatest of all brood mares, was probably a\r\ndaughter of this same horse, Cadmus. This mare, Shanghai Mary, was a\r\ntrotter of speed, not far from a 2:30 gait, and she won some races, but\r\nshe was hot-headed and unreliable. Notwithstanding continuous searches,\r\nfor years, her origin remained a profound mystery, until of recent date\r\ncertain facts point to Mr. Coffein as her breeder and Cadmus as her sire.\r\nThis has not been established historically, but when the circumstances\r\nare understood and taken in connection with the internal evidences, which\r\nare amazingly strong, and had been pointed out and applied to this sire\r\nlong before the recent developments, there remains hardly a moral doubt\r\nthat she was by Cadmus. The fact that this mare is the maternal grandam\r\nof Electioneer, the greatest of all trotting sires to date, makes her\r\npedigree a matter of special interest, and for details of the various\r\ninvestigations the reader is referred to _Wallace’s Monthly_, and to\r\nChapter XXIX. of this volume.\r\n\r\nPocahontas seems to have produced but five foals that reached maturity:\r\n1855, Tom Rolfe, of which hereafter; 1859, Young Pocahontas, by Ethan\r\nAllen, a very fast trotter; 1860, May Queen, by Ethan Allen; 1861, May\r\nDay, by Miles Standish; 1863 bay colt Strideway, by Black Hawk Telegraph.\r\nThis was a very fast and promising young horse, and doubtless would have\r\nstood among the fastest stallions of his day, but he died on the very eve\r\nof his public appearance on the trotting turf.\r\n\r\nTOM ROLFE had a checkered existence from his conception. His dam,\r\nPocahontas, was bred to Pugh’s Aratus, by Abraham Pierce, her then owner,\r\nMay 10, 1853, and ten days afterward she was sold without her new owner’s\r\nknowing she had been bred. He was thus carried in his mother’s womb,\r\nduring her training and through her racing campaign in New Orleans, until\r\na little over two months of the time he was dropped. During most of this\r\nperiod those handling the mare did not know she had been bred, and hence\r\nthe story that Tom was a “catch” colt. He was a bay, about fifteen hands\r\ntwo inches high, and came to his speed with very little handling. In\r\nprivate trials, it is said, he had frequently shown a mile in 2:23. While\r\non exhibition in a small ring at Dayton, Ohio, he met with an accident,\r\nfrom which he was ever afterward a cripple. In this condition however,\r\nhe afterward made a record in 2:33½. His sire, Pugh’s Aratus, was a\r\nlarge, handsome farm horse, sixteen hands two inches high, and weighing\r\none thousand three hundred pounds. He was got by Phares’ Aratus, out\r\nof a fast pacing mare. There is no evidence whatever going to show that\r\nPhares’ Aratus was a son of Aratus by Director. The type of the family\r\ndid not indicate the possession of any running blood. Tom Rolfe put four\r\ntrotters and three pacers, all with fast records, into the 2:30 list, and\r\nthree of his sons left twenty-nine performers. In the latter years of his\r\nlife he was sold by Mr. Woodmansee to Mr. Wesley P. Balch, of Boston, and\r\ndied 1877.\r\n\r\nYOUNG ROLFE was the best son of Tom Rolfe. He was a bay, foaled 1876, and\r\ncame out of Judith, by Draco, son of Young Morrill, and she out of Lady\r\nBalch, by Rising Sun. He was bred by Wesley P. Balch, passed to C. H.\r\nNelson, of Maine, then back to John Sheppard of Boston, and died 1884,\r\nwhen only eight years old. He was one of the best horses of his day, as\r\na race horse, and his early death was universally considered a great\r\nloss to the breeding interests of the country. He has to his credit nine\r\nrepresentative trotters in the 2:30 list.\r\n\r\nNELSON, the great son of Young Rolfe, was bred and owned by G. H.\r\nNelson, Waterville, Maine. He is a bay horse, foaled 1882, and out of\r\nGretchen, the daughter of Gideon, by Hambletonian, 10, and she out of\r\nthe fast trotting mare Kate, by Vermont Black Hawk. This horse Gideon,\r\nthe son of Hambletonian, was, like his sire, very strongly inbred to old\r\nMessenger, tracing through mares by Young Engineer and Young Commander,\r\nboth grandsons of Messenger, to the William Hunter mare, that was by\r\nMessenger himself. When the pedigree of Nelson is compared with the\r\npedigree of Hambletonian, according to the rules of arithmetic, it may be\r\nfound to contain nearly or quite as much Messenger blood as Hambletonian\r\npossessed, but, unfortunately, we know nothing of the trotting capacity\r\nof the intervening mares. If we had a “One Eye” and a “Charles Kent\r\nMare” coming next to the William Hunter mare, we would have much greater\r\nexpectations. But, as it is, when we consider the superlative capacity of\r\nNelson himself, with his record of 2:09, and his nineteen trotters and\r\nseven pacers already to his credit, it is probable he will found a large\r\nand valuable family.\r\n\r\nThrough his son Blanco, sire of Smuggler, we have another notable line to\r\nIrons’ Cadmus. Smuggler was in his day the champion trotting stallion,\r\ntaking a record of 2:15¼ when owned by Colonel Russell, of Boston,\r\nand driven by Charles Marvin, who after long and painstaking efforts\r\nconverted him from his natural gait, the pace, to the trot. Wearing\r\ntwenty-four ounces on each fore-foot to keep him at the trot, Smuggler\r\ndefeated all the best horses of his day, including Goldsmith Maid. He\r\nwas by Blanco, out of a pacing mare of unknown blood. As might have been\r\nexpected, he failed to found a great family, though fourteen of his get\r\nare standard performers, and twelve of his sons and seventeen of his\r\ndaughters have produced thirty-eight performers.\r\n\r\nTOM HAL.—The original Tom Hal was taken to Kentucky, as early, probably,\r\nas 1824, and as was the custom in those days, he was called a Canadian,\r\nlike all other pacing horses. The tradition is that Dr. Boswell got\r\nhim in Philadelphia and rode him home to Lexington, Kentucky. Another\r\nstatement is that he was taken to Kentucky by John T. Mason, and this\r\nstatement appears in the advertisement of the horse for the year 1828.\r\nAs the horse was in the hands of William L. Breckenridge that year, and\r\nas his advertisement was practically a contemporaneous record, we must\r\ngive the preference to the Mason representation. He was a roan horse, as\r\nI understand, a little over fifteen hands high, stout and stylish. He\r\nwas very smooth and pleasant in his gait and a very fast pacer. He was\r\nfor some time in the hands of Captain West, of Georgetown, Kentucky, and\r\nthen passed to Benjamin N. Shropshire, of Harrison County, and after some\r\nyears he died his property.\r\n\r\nBALD STOCKINGS, also known as Lail’s Tom Hal, was a chestnut horse with a\r\nbald face and four white legs. He was foaled early in the “forties,” and\r\nwas got by the original Tom Hal, and his dam was by Chinn’s Copperbottom.\r\nHe was bred by Higgins Chinn, Harrison County, kept for a time by John\r\nLucas, and owned by Mr. Lail, of the same county. He was one of the\r\nprominent links between the old and the new, and was a fast pacer.\r\n\r\nSORREL TOM was a son of Bald Stockings (Lail’s Tom Hal) and bore the same\r\ncolor and markings. He was bred and owned by John Shawhan, of Harrison\r\nCounty, Kentucky. His dam was a grey mare from Ohio, of unknown breeding.\r\nHe was kept at Falmouth, Indiana, the seasons of 1857 and 1858, and was\r\nvery widely known in that region as “Shawhan’s Tom Hal.” He was quite a\r\nlarge horse, and to take the description as given him, “he could pace\r\nlike the wind.” He was then taken back to Kentucky, leaving a multitude\r\nof good colts behind him, among them the famous pacing gelding, Hoosier\r\nTom, 2:19½. One of his Indiana sons passed into the hands of William\r\nGray, of Rush County, Indiana, and became known as Gray’s Tom Hal.\r\nNothing is known of the dam of this horse. He was the sire of Little\r\nGipsey, trotter, 2:22, and Limber Jack, pacer, 2:18½, besides six\r\ndaughters that produced nine performers.\r\n\r\nAbout 1863-4 Mr. Shropshire, Jr., a son of the owner of the original Tom\r\nHal, brought a little roan Tom Hal horse to Rushville, Indiana, where\r\nhe stood a number of years and was known as Shropshire’s Tom Hal. This\r\nhorse was probably by Lail’s Tom Hal, as he was too young to be by the\r\noriginal of the name. He was a fast pacer, but nothing is known of his\r\nprogeny or history. The locating of this Indiana branch of the family is\r\nof particular interest, for it shows a concentration of pacing blood that\r\nwas doubtless a strong reinforcement to Blue Bull.\r\n\r\nTOM HAL (KITTRELL’S) was a large bay horse and a pacer, bought by Major\r\nM. B. Kittrell in 1850 of Simeon Kirtly, near Centerville, Bourbon\r\nCounty, Kentucky, and taken to Middle Tennessee. His sire was represented\r\nto have been a large pacing bay horse that was brought from Canada,\r\nthereby implying that he was the original of the name, brought to\r\nKentucky. While it is possible that the original Mason horse may have\r\nbeen the sire of Major Kittrell’s horse, the size and color of that horse\r\ndo not correspond with what has been accepted as facts. It is altogether\r\nmore probable that the sire of the Tennessee horse was a son of the\r\noriginal Tom Hal, as the roan color seems to be strongly fixed in all\r\nbranches of the family.\r\n\r\nTOM HAL JR. (GIBSON’S) was a roan horse, foaled 1860. Got by Kittrell’s\r\nTom Hal; dam (bred by John Leonard), by Adam’s Stump, pacer; grandam\r\nsaid to be by Cummings’ Whip, pacer. Bred by H. C. Saunders, Nashville,\r\nTennessee; kept a number of years by T. D. Moore, Petersburg, Tennessee,\r\nafterward owned by Polk Bros. and Major Campbell Brown, of Springhill,\r\nTennessee. Adams’ Stump was a roan horse and a fast pacer and he\r\nwas not only the sire of Julia Johnson, the dam of this horse, but\r\nalso of the dam of Bonesetter. He died of old age, July, 1890. The\r\nstrong concentration of pacing blood in his veins gave him unusual\r\npower in transmitting his inherited habit of action. He put fourteen\r\nrepresentatives in the 2:30 list, and what is unprecedented, they are all\r\npacers.\r\n\r\nBROWN HAL is a brown horse, as his name indicates, foaled 1879, got by\r\nGibson’s Tom Hal; dam the pacing mare Lizzie, the dam of the pacer Little\r\nBrown Jug, by John Netherland, son of Henry Hal; grandam Blackie, by John\r\nHal, son of John Eaton; great-grandam Old March, by Young Conqueror.\r\nBred by R. H. Moore, Culleoka, Tennessee, passed to M. C. Campbell and\r\nCampbell Brown, Springhill, Tennessee. Here we have a still stronger\r\nintensification of the pacing instinct, for this horse not only has a\r\npacing record himself of 2:12½, but he put twenty of his progeny into the\r\nstandard list, and all of them pacers. It is not shown by the Year Book\r\nthat either this horse or his sire has any trotters to his credit, but it\r\ncan hardly be doubted that some of their progeny took naturally to the\r\ndiagonal trot, and not showing encouraging speed, were never developed.\r\n\r\nIf the question were asked, “What is to result from this intensely pacing\r\nfamily?” it would be very difficult to frame a satisfactory answer. At\r\npresent this family shows all the vigor of youth in its new development,\r\nbut, judging by others that have come and gone, it too, in its turn, will\r\nbe submerged in more prepotent strains, that will more nearly meet the\r\nwants of their masters. The pacer has been lifted from obscurity and made\r\nthe equal of the trotter as a race horse; his blood has contributed to an\r\nunknown extent in giving speed to the trotter, but he must be as good a\r\nhorse for all uses as the trotter, or nobody will want him.\r\n\r\nKENTUCKY HUNTER, the head of the family bearing this name that, at one\r\ntime, was very prominent in Central New York, was foaled 1822, and was\r\nbred by Louis Sherrill of New Hartford, New York, and was got by Watkins’\r\nHighlander. His dam was a mare bought from a couple of dealers who were\r\npassing through New Hartford with some six or seven horses for sale, and\r\nthey represented this mare to have been brought from Kentucky. On this\r\nrepresentation she was called “a Kentucky mare.” She was a fine saddle\r\nmare and for this reason she was used chiefly for that service. From\r\nher superiority as a saddler, I think it is safe to conclude she was\r\na pacer and could go the saddle gaits. Kentucky Hunter was a chestnut\r\nhorse, a little above medium size. Mr. Sherrill sold him when young to\r\nMessrs. Bagg and Goodrich who kept him two years and sold him to William\r\nFerguson, of Oriskany Falls, New York, and Mr. Ferguson continued to own\r\nhim till he died in 1838.\r\n\r\nDuring the lifetime of this horse the pacing gait was considered an\r\nevidence of bad breeding, and this prejudice has continued for many\r\nyears. The saddle was going out of use and wheels were coming in. After\r\nFlora Temple electrified the trotting world, writers had a great deal\r\nto say of her origin and family, but no one ever intimated that her\r\ngrandsire was a pacer. From sources that I have no reason to doubt,\r\nI have been informed he was not only a pacer, but a fast pacer. This\r\nhabit of action was not popular with breeders, and Mr. Ferguson kept it\r\nconcealed as much as possible. When the pacer, Oneida Chief, from his own\r\nloins, was beating Lady Suffolk, three miles in 7:44, to saddle, and many\r\nof the other cracks of that day, his sire was dead and nothing was then\r\nto be made by proclaiming from the housetops that Oneida Chief was by old\r\nKentucky Hunter.\r\n\r\nVery little is known of Watkins’ Highlander, the sire of this horse.\r\nHe was brought to Whitestown, New York, 1821, by Julius Watkins, from\r\nConnecticut. Some of the older men who knew the horse insist that Mr.\r\nWatkins represented him to be by a son of imported Messenger, and out\r\nof Nancy Dawson by imported Brown Highlander. This is possible, indeed\r\nprobable, but it is not established.\r\n\r\nBOGUS HUNTER was one of the younger sons of Kentucky Hunter. He was a\r\nchestnut horse of good size and came out of a mare by Bogus. But little\r\nis known of this horse, and that little is rendered still more uncertain\r\nby the unreliable character of his owners, the Loomis brothers, of\r\nSangerfield, New York. It is certain, however, that a horse owned by the\r\nLoomises and called by this name was the sire of the famous world beater,\r\nFlora Temple. This fact rests upon the testimony of Mr. Samuel Welch,\r\na reputable and trustworthy man who owned the dam of Flora and had her\r\ncoupled with this horse, under his own eye.\r\n\r\nEDWIN FORREST, the most prominent representative of this family, was a\r\nlarge and rather loosely made bay horse, foaled 1851, got by Young Bay\r\nKentucky Hunter, son of Bay Kentucky Hunter, that was by the original\r\nKentucky Hunter. His dam, Doll, bred by Mrs. Crane, of Whitestown, Oneida\r\nCounty, New York, was by Watkins’ Highlander; grandam a chestnut mare\r\nowned in the Crane family, by Black River Messenger, son of Ogden’s\r\nMessenger. The identification of this grandson of imported Messenger was\r\nsecured after the appearance of the fifth volume of the “Register.” This\r\nsame mare, Doll, the next year produced Wamock’s Highland Messenger,\r\nthat was taken to Kentucky, and was a valuable element in the road-horse\r\nblood of that State. Edwin Forrest was bred by Barnes Davis, Oneida,\r\nMadison County; owned two years by H. L. Barker, of Clinton, New York,\r\nsold to Marcus Downing, of Kentucky, by him to Woodburn Farm, and after\r\na time he passed to a company at Keokuk, Iowa, and then to George W.\r\nFerguson, of Marshalltown, Iowa, where he was burned up in 1874.\r\n\r\nIt has been said this horse was a pacer and converted to a trotter,\r\nbut this does not seem to be sustained by the facts. He was shown as\r\na three-year-old at the Oneida County Fair, and he was then a square\r\nnatural trotter and was considered very fast, for he was fully able to\r\ndistance all the other colts of his age. The story of his being a pacer\r\nprobably grew out of the fact that there was a strong pacing strain in\r\nthe family, as the original Kentucky Hunter was undoubtedly a pacer. Many\r\nof the Kentucky Hunters were speedy travelers and a few of them were\r\nfast. Black River Messenger was a horse of very wide local reputation\r\nfor the superiority of his progeny as rapid travelers. The union of the\r\nMessenger blood with pacing blood produced excellent results in this, as\r\nwell as in thousands of other cases. As was the common usage before the\r\nestablishment of the “Trotting Register,” this horse was advertised with\r\ntwo fictitious crosses added to his pedigree—his grandam was given as\r\nby Duroc, and his great-grandam as by imported Messenger. Only two from\r\nhis loins were able to enter the 2:30 list; six of his sons got seven\r\nperformers and twelve of his daughters produced fifteen trotters.\r\n\r\nSKENANDOAH (afterward called Kentucky Hunter) was a bay horse, foaled\r\n1854, got by Brokenlegged Hunter, son of the original Kentucky Hunter;\r\ndam not clearly established. He was bred by Mr. Sykes, near Canastota,\r\nand passed through several hands to Henry Dewey, of Morrisville, New\r\nYork, who trotted him in a number of races in Central New York and then\r\ntook him to California, where he was kept in the stud a number of years\r\nunder the name of Kentucky Hunter, and died there 1871. He got one\r\ntrotter; one son that left two performers and seven daughters that left\r\nnine performers.\r\n\r\nDREW HORSE, commonly called “Old Drew,” was a brown bay horse, foaled\r\n1842, and was about fifteen and one-quarter hands high and well-formed.\r\nHe was bred, or rather raised, by Hiram Drew, then of Exeter, Maine,\r\nwho kept him all his life. The story of his supposed sire was one of\r\nthose weakly devised fictions, so common in that day, and especially\r\nwhere the Canadian border could be made effective in rounding it out.\r\nTo show that the mysterious colt that became the sire of Drew Horse was\r\n“thoroughbred,” the stereotyped “British Army officer” is made available,\r\nfor the hundredth time, as having brought a mare from England in foal to\r\na thoroughbred horse, the foal was dropped and at three years old he was\r\ntraded by the aforesaid “officer” to the party that brought the colt to\r\nMaine. Unfortunately for the story, the party who made the trade and the\r\nstory had a bad memory, and sometimes he located the trade at St. Johns\r\nand sometimes at Fredericton, New Brunswick. But the fiction served its\r\ngeneration and was not exposed till long after the Drew Horse was dead.\r\nThe facts in the matter seem to be simply these: a stallion colt was\r\nrunning in a pasture adjoining Mr. Drew’s pasture, and that colt got over\r\nthe fence, was found with Mr. Drew’s mare, and in due time she dropped\r\nthe colt known as the “Drew Horse.” The fence-breaker was soon after made\r\na gelding and sold, and nothing is known of him, either before or after\r\nthis escapade. The dam of the Drew Horse was a bay mare about fifteen\r\nand one-half hands high, foaled about 1836, and bred by Mark Pease, of\r\nJackson, Maine. Her sire was called Sir Henry and was represented to be\r\nby a son of American Eclipse, that was taken to Maine from Connecticut\r\nby Dr. Brewster and sold to General F. W. Lander. She was known as Grace\r\nDarling and afterward as Boston Girl. She was on the turf and was quite\r\na trotter, and it is claimed she made a record of 2:37, and her dam was\r\nLady Jane by Winthrop Messenger. While I don’t know what the inheritance\r\nof this horse was on the side of his sire, I do know that he had a\r\ntrotting inheritance on the side of his dam. He lived till 1866 and then\r\nhad to be destroyed on account of a broken leg.\r\n\r\nThis horse was never trained, and it is not known what he might have been\r\nable to do as a trotter. He put two of his sons in the 2:30 list, Dirigo\r\nand General McClellan. Of his sons, two put five trotters and three\r\npacers in the list, and of his daughters left six representatives there.\r\nBesides these he left a number of others with records a little short of\r\nthe limit of speed, and many without records that were fast and very game\r\nroadsters.\r\n\r\nDIRIGO, at first called George B. McClellan, under which name he made\r\nhis record, was the best son of Drew Horse. He was a brown horse, and in\r\nappearance much like his sire. He was foaled 1856 and came out of a mare\r\nthat has not been traced, but was doubtless a pacing mare. He was bred by\r\nHorace McKinney, Monroe, Maine, and passed to David Quimby, of Corinna,\r\nMaine, and died 1884. He made his record of 2:29 in a single heat and\r\nnever was on the track again. Four trotters and two pacers by him entered\r\nthe 2:30 list. Two of his sons became the sires of three trotters, and\r\nfive of his daughters each produced a performer. He left others with and\r\nwithout records that were fast and stylish drivers.\r\n\r\nHIRAM DREW, at first called Bay Morgan, was a son of Old Drew, and\r\nhis dam was a small bay mare, owned near Bangor and said to be of\r\nMorgan blood. This horse was on the turf some years and was engaged in\r\nsome locally important contests, but never was able to make himself\r\nstandard either by his own or the performances of his progeny. His best\r\nperformance, I believe, was 2:31½.\r\n\r\nWINTHROP was a bay horse, foaled 1864, got by Drew Horse; dam by the Eton\r\nHorse and grandam by Stone or Simpson’s Messenger. He was bred by E. J.\r\nGreene, Newport, Maine; taken to California 1870, and there owned by\r\nJudge W. E. Greens and L. E. Yates, of Stockton. It does not appear that\r\nhe ever was trained, and consequently has no record. His opportunities,\r\nprobably, were not very great, but whether or not, he was not successful\r\nin the stud. He left one trotter and one pacer and the dams of one\r\ntrotter and one pacer.\r\n\r\nThis family never was large, and its popularity was up and down just as\r\na few individuals might be successful or unsuccessful on the turf. To\r\nstart with, it had a very weak inheritance of trotting instinct, and\r\nthat weakness did not strengthen in succeeding generations. Of late\r\nyears it has failed to maintain itself as a trotting family, and is now\r\npractically out of the reckoning of trotters.\r\n\r\nHIATOGA, generally known as Rice’s Hiatoga, was a bay pacing horse and\r\nwas bred in Rockingham County, Virginia, and taken to Fairfield County,\r\nOhio, by Edward Rice, some time about 1836. He had the reputation of\r\nbeing a fast pacer, and was sold to William Shiruo, of the same county,\r\nand by him to William Munger, in whose possession he died. He was got by\r\na horse known in Virginia as Hiatoga, and also American Hiatoga, but\r\nnothing is known of the blood of his dam. Nothing is known of his speed\r\nor his progeny except through the two sons here given.\r\n\r\nHiatoga, generally designated as “Old Togue,” was got by Rice’s Hiatoga;\r\ndam by Thunderbolt, grandam by Black or Bold Rover. He was foaled 1843\r\nand was bred by David W. Brown, of Perry County, Ohio; sold 1849 to John\r\nJoseph, Kirkersville, Ohio, where he made some seasons and was sold 1855\r\nto Alvah Perry, Lancaster, where he remained till 1863, and was sold to\r\nHarvey Wilson, and two years later to William McDonald, Columbus, Ohio,\r\nwhere he died 1871. This horse left excellent stock and many of them fast\r\npacers, but they never cut much figure on the turf.\r\n\r\nHIATOGA (HANLEY’S) was a bay pacing horse of good size and quality and\r\nwas very popular as a sire. He was foaled 1849, got by Rice’s Hiatoga;\r\ndam an elegant bay mare sixteen hands high and represented to be of “Sir\r\nPeter and Eclipse blood.” This mare was formerly given as by Firetail,\r\nbut the present rendering, whatever it may mean, comes from sources with\r\nopportunities to know. He was bred by John Bright, of Fairfield County,\r\nsold to Joseph Watt, and taken to Harrison County and then to Jefferson\r\nCounty, and sold to James Davis Tweed. He next passed through the hands\r\nof David Rittenhouse and Moses Hanley, of Hopedale, Ohio, and after three\r\nor four years in the stud Mr. Hanley sold him to David Rittenhouse,\r\nJohn Wiley and Samuel Hanley for two thousand five hundred dollars, and\r\nhe died the property of Mr. Rittenhouse near Hopedale, Ohio, 1858. Two\r\nof his progeny entered the 2:30 list; three of his sons left thirteen\r\nperformers, and three daughters produced five.\r\n\r\nHIATOGA (SCOTT’S) was a bay pacer foaled 1858, got by Hanley’s Hiatoga;\r\ndam by Blind Tuckahoe (pacer); grandam by Consul. This horse was quite\r\nfast and paced under the name of Tuscarawas Chief. He was the best of\r\nthe family and was bred and owned by Samuel Scott, East Springfield,\r\nJefferson County, Ohio. He put five trotters and four pacers in the 2:30\r\nlist; seven of his sons and seventeen of his daughters were producers.\r\n\r\nThe Hiatoga family seems to have no trotting inheritance except from the\r\npacer. It is a useful family and still has vitality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK HAWK OR MORGAN FAMILY.\r\n\r\n    Characteristics of the Morgans—History of the original\r\n    Morgan—The fabled pedigree—The true Briton theory—Justin\r\n    Morgan’s breeding hopelessly unknown—Sherman Morgan—Black\r\n    Hawk—His disputed paternity—His dam called a Narragansett—Ethan\r\n    Allen—His great beauty, speed and popularity—The Flying Morgan\r\n    claim baseless—His dam of unknown blood—His great race with\r\n    Dexter—Daniel Lambert, the only successful sire of the Black\r\n    Hawk line.\r\n\r\n\r\nFifty years ago there was no family of horses so popular as the\r\n“Morgans.” They were carried into all parts of the country at high prices\r\nand they gave their purchasers general satisfaction. They were small,\r\nperhaps not averaging over fourteen and a half hands high, but compact,\r\ntrappy movers and had most excellent dispositions. Many of them were\r\nideal roadsters, where speed was not in great demand, for they were\r\nkindly, tractable and always on their courage. Many of them carried\r\nthemselves in excellent style, and notwithstanding their diminutive size,\r\nit is not probable we will ever again see a better tribe of every-day,\r\nfamily horses. In all their outline and in every lineament they were the\r\nvery opposite of the blood horse, and when bred on any strain outside\r\nof their own family, they almost universally failed to impress their\r\nown characteristics on their progeny. This failure I observed with deep\r\nregret more than forty years ago. The step could be extended and the\r\nspeed increased by crossing with the long striders, but in securing this\r\nwe lost the Morgan. In advance of their general distribution they had\r\nthe misfortune to be heralded as great trotters, and in this respect,\r\nat least, they failed of meeting expectations. They went, largely, into\r\nthe hands of inexperienced men, who knew nothing about how to cultivate\r\nspeed, and the little, short, quick steps of their new trotters gave\r\nthem all the sensations of going fast, without the danger incident\r\nto rapid traveling. In regard to the matter of speed, through the\r\noverzealous and not too conscientious editors and others to say nothing\r\nof the advertisements of those who had them for sale, they suffered\r\ngreatly by too much praise. The result is that the original type has\r\nbeen extinguished, and it is doubtful whether a fair specimen could be\r\nfound, even among the mountains of New England. Next to the injury which\r\nthe family sustained from the exaggerated claims of speed put forward\r\nby its too sanguine friends, there was another and even greater injury\r\nfrom the absurd and foolish claims made for his blood. It is impossible\r\nto make a thinking and sensible man believe that a little hairy-legged\r\n“nubbin” of a pony, weighing eight hundred and fifty pounds, hired for\r\nfifteen dollars a year to drag logs together in a clearing, at which\r\nemployment he was a great success, had the blood of the race horse in his\r\nveins. This was always a stumbling block to my immature enthusiasm for\r\nthe Morgan horse. From an experience of a great many years and from the\r\ndevelopments of horse history during that time, I find the “stumbling\r\nblock” no longer worries me, for it has rotted away and disappeared.\r\nAlthough the family has ceased to exist as a factor in current horse\r\nhistory, it had a history in the past; and, as a historian, I must\r\nconsider its origin as well as the deeds it has accomplished or failed to\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\nMr. Justin Morgan, the central figure in this investigation, was born\r\nin West Springfield, 1747, where he married and lived till 1788, when\r\nhe removed to Randolph, Vermont, where he died, March, 1798. He was a\r\nreputable citizen, fairly well educated for his time, and taught school\r\nfor a living. He owned a house and lot in his native town, where he kept\r\na wayside house of entertainment, and during the early summer he usually\r\nhad a stallion to keep on the shares. In the spring of 1785 he had charge\r\nof the horse True Briton, or Beautiful Bay, and I will here add that\r\nthree years later, John Morgan, Jr., had charge of the same horse at\r\nSpringfield, for the seasons of 1788 and 1789. This John Morgan, Jr.,\r\nremoved to Lima, New York, late in 1790 or early in 1791. Justin had sold\r\nhis place in West Springfield to Abner Morgan, on long payments, and in\r\nthe summer of 1795 he came back to West Springfield to collect some money\r\nthat was due him, presumably on the price of his former home, but he\r\nfailed to get money and took two colts instead. One was a three-year-old\r\ngelding and the other was a two-year-old bay colt, entire. He led the\r\nthree-year-old with a halter and the two-year-old followed. The date\r\nof this visit to the old home is the key to the main question to be\r\nsettled, and it is fixed by Justin Morgan, Jr., then a lad of the right\r\nage to remember such things, and by Soloman Steele and Judge Griswold,\r\nwho fix the date in the late summer of 1795. The horse was sold and\r\nresold and sold again, as a foal of 1793, and that date never left him\r\ntill he died in 1821. I look upon this date as perfectly immovable, and\r\nevery attempt that has been made to overthrow it has not been based on\r\nany reasonable evidence, nor prompted by a desire to get at the truth,\r\nbut only to make a fictitious sire a possibility. This was the original\r\nMorgan Horse, and this date was thoroughly fixed by Linsley, without\r\nknowing that it upset the pedigree he had labored so hard to establish.\r\nAfter a lapse of fifty years an attempt was made to fix up a pedigree for\r\nthe “Original Morgan Horse,” claiming that he was got by True Briton or\r\nBeautiful Bay—represented to be a great race horse, stolen from the great\r\nrace horse man, Colonel De Lancey, in the Revolutionary War. I must,\r\ntherefore, consider, briefly, this part of the fiction.\r\n\r\nFirst—As a starting point in the pedigree, it is assumed that the\r\nrace-horse in question was stolen, during the War of the Revolution, from\r\nJames De Lancey, perhaps the largest and most widely known of all the\r\ncolonial horsemen of that day. He was the first man to import race horses\r\ninto this colony, and his name and the fame of his horses were discussed\r\neverywhere. He was very rich, in politics a Tory, and on the eve of\r\nhostilities he sold out every horse he owned, of whatever description,\r\nwent back to England and never returned. This disposes of the false\r\nassumption that the sire of the original Morgan horse was stolen from him.\r\n\r\nSecond—There was another James De Lancey, cousin to the preceding, and\r\nnot a rich man, who was colonel of a body of Tory cavalry operating in\r\nWestchester County from 1777 to the close of the war in 1782. It is not\r\nknown whether he ever owned a race horse in his life, but it is certain\r\nhe was a dashing fighter, and at the head of the cowboys he was known to\r\nthe inhabitants of all that region. His name is not to be found anywhere\r\nin connection with horses. He bore, in full, the same name as the\r\ndistinguished horseman, and was mistaken for him, although he was on the\r\nother side of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThird—It is claimed that “one Smith” stole the horse in question from\r\nColonel De Lancey and sold him to Mr. Ward, of Hartford, Connecticut, who\r\nkept him a few years and sold him to Selah Norton, of the same place,\r\nand remained his till he died. Who was this “one Smith” and where did he\r\nbelong? Where is the evidence that this “one Smith” stole a horse from\r\nColonel De Lancey?\r\n\r\nFourth—In the New York _Packet_, then published at Fishkill, under date\r\nof October 19, 1780, we find the following: “Last week Lieutenant Wright\r\nCarpenter and two others went down to Colonel James De Lancey’s quarters\r\nand lay in wait for his appearance. He accordingly came and having tied\r\nhis horse at the door, went into the house; upon which Carpenter seized\r\nthe horse and mounted. When De Lancey discovered him, he immediately\r\nalarmed his men, who pursued him to White Plains, but in vain,” etc.,\r\netc. This Lieutenant Carpenter was a dashing young fellow and was\r\npromoted next month to the position of first lieutenant in Captain Lyons’\r\ncompany, of the Second Regiment of New York Militia, of Westchester\r\nCounty, and still commanded by Colonel Thomas. This is the man who stole\r\nthe horse, this is the contemporaneous evidence of it, and “one Smith”\r\nhad nothing to do with it.\r\n\r\nIn these four points we have what may be considered the first chapter\r\nof this investigation and, as will be readily seen, each of them must\r\nbe fatal to the pretentious claim that has been maintained for about a\r\nhundred years. Avoiding all circumlocution, I think it is safe to say\r\nthat this so-called pedigree did not originate this side of Hartford. The\r\nSecond Regiment of New York Militia, called “The Skinners,” was made up\r\nof Westchester County men, and as Colonel De Lancey had been sheriff of\r\nthat county, everybody knew him and knew that he was not the race horse\r\nJames. We must, therefore, look further on for the time when and the\r\nperson by whom this pedigree was manufactured.\r\n\r\nIn 1784 this horse was advertised at Lanesboro, Massachusetts, under the\r\nname of Beautiful Bay, and no attempt was made to give a pedigree or\r\norigin of the horse.\r\n\r\nIn 1785 he was at West Springfield, Massachusetts, in charge of Justin\r\nMorgan, still called Beautiful Bay, and still no pedigree.\r\n\r\nIn 1788 and 1789 he was in charge of John Morgan, Jr., of Springfield,\r\nMassachusetts, and here, for the first time, he is designated as “the\r\nfamous full-blooded English horse, called True Briton or Beautiful Bay,”\r\nbut no pedigree is given.\r\n\r\nIn 1791 he was advertised at East Hartford, Connecticut, by his owner,\r\nSelah Norton, and his pedigree is here given for the first time as\r\nfollows: “True Briton, or Beautiful Bay, got by imported Traveler, dam De\r\nLancey’s racer.” After advertising the horse for seven years without a\r\npedigree, at last Mr. Selah Norton manufactures one and gives it over his\r\nown signature.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 he is again called Beautiful Bay, but no pedigree, at South\r\nHadley, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 and 1795 he was kept at Ashfield, Massachusetts, by Mr. Norton\r\nhimself, and called Traveler, and his pedigree is again given in amended\r\nform as follows: “Sired by the famous old Traveler, imported from\r\nIreland, dam Colonel De Lancey’s imported racer.”\r\n\r\nThis is the last trace we have of the horse Beautiful Bay, for that\r\nseems to be his honest name, and now I must ask some questions. These\r\nadvertisements cover a period of eleven years and they are worthy of\r\ncareful study. From 1784 to 1791 there is no attempt at giving any\r\npedigree at all. With the exception of three seasons he seems to have\r\nbeen let, probably on shares, to different keepers, in different parts\r\nof the country. From first to last Selah Norton seems to have been his\r\nowner. If he had received the pedigree, and the romantic story of his\r\ntheft, from “one Smith,” as claimed, is it conceivable that he would have\r\nconcealed that story from the public when it would have added so much to\r\nthe patronage of his horse? How does it come that not a single man having\r\nthis stallion in charge, except Selah Norton himself, ever gave his\r\npedigree? What prompted Selah Norton to withdraw the horse from public\r\nservice, in Hartford, immediately after he first gave his pedigree? Was\r\nit because everybody there knew it was a fraud? When the horse was taken\r\nto South Hadley in 1793, why did his keeper there refuse to accept either\r\nthe name True Briton or the new pedigree? It will be observed he was\r\nadvertised there simply as Beautiful Bay and no pedigree given. The next\r\ntwo years we find him at Ashfield, Massachusetts, to which point it would\r\nseem his owner had removed from Hartford. For some reason that can be\r\nbetter imagined than explained, the names Beautiful Bay and True Briton\r\nare there dropped and he is rechristened as Traveler. To this change of\r\nname the old pedigree is attached, with a very important change in that\r\nalso, as follows: “Sired by famous old Traveler, imported from Ireland,\r\ndam Colonel De Lancey’s imported racer.” These three words, “imported\r\nfrom Ireland,” are very important in two particulars, for they not only\r\nknock out the “featherheads” who have been always maintaining that the\r\nimported Traveler meant Lloyd’s Traveler of New Jersey, son of Morton’s\r\nTraveler, that was imported from Yorkshire into Virginia about 1750,\r\nbut it convicts Selah Norton of inventing this pedigree, for there was\r\nno such horse brought from Ireland. It is certainly unnecessary to say\r\nanother word in illustration of Selah Norton’s character. When we study\r\nthese advertisements it becomes as clear as the light of day that nobody\r\nbelieved him or the story that “one Smith” stole the horse from Colonel\r\nDe Lancey. The crimes of horse stealing and desertion were exceedingly\r\ncommon during the period of the revolution and it is quite possible that\r\n“one Smith” may have stolen a horse out of somebody’s stable and sold him\r\nto Mr. Ward or Mr. Norton as the same horse that Lieutenant Carpenter\r\nstole from Colonel De Lancey, but neither “one Smith” nor “one Norton”\r\nknew anything more about his pedigree than he did about the man in the\r\nmoon, and I will here end the second chapter of this investigation.\r\n\r\nI am clearly of the opinion that Justin Morgan was an honest man and that\r\nhe would not tell a lie, even if he knew it might accrue to his present\r\nand personal advantage. He was poor, feeble in health, and had hard\r\nscuffling to get along. As a means of livelihood, in part at least, it\r\nseems to have been his business for a good many years to keep stallions\r\non shares for different owners. As late as 1795 he had a horse from\r\nHartford, Connecticut, called Figure, to which we will refer later on.\r\nIn 1788 he sold his little place in West Springfield, Massachusetts, and\r\nremoved to Randolph, Vermont, where he died in March, 1798 In the autumn\r\nof 1795 he visited West Springfield again, for the purpose of collecting\r\nsome money that was still due him there, probably some deferred payments\r\nof his former home, and as he was not able to get the money he took two\r\nhorses in lieu thereof. One was a three-year-old gelding, and the other\r\nwas a two-year-old bay colt, entire. He led the gelding beside the horse\r\nhe was riding and the colt followed all the way. The evidence that fixes\r\nthe date of this trip in the autumn of 1795 and the age of the colt that\r\nfollowed seems to me to be completely bomb-proof. This evidence not only\r\nembraces the recollections of Justin Morgan’s neighbors, but when he died\r\nthe colt, in 1798, was sold by his administrators as a five-year-old. In\r\nall the changes of ownership that took place through his life and at his\r\ndeath, in 1821, he was represented as foaled in 1793. He died from the\r\neffects of a kick that was neglected, and not from old age.\r\n\r\nThe only serious attempt that has been made to controvert the date\r\nof 1793 was that made in the name of John Morgan, of Lima, New York,\r\nin 1842, he being then eighty years old, in the Albany _Cultivator_.\r\nUnfortunately the editor fails to publish the letter he professes to\r\nhave received from John Morgan and only gives his construction of it,\r\nwhich any child knows is no evidence at all. The editor represents him\r\nto say “that the two-year-old stud which he (Justin) took with him to\r\nVermont was sired by a horse owned by Selah Norton, of East Hartford,\r\nConnecticut, called True Briton or Beautiful Bay.” Justin Morgan removed\r\nto Randolph, Vermont, in the spring of 1788, and this John Morgan removed\r\nto Lima, New York, about February, 1790. They were not brothers, but\r\ndistant relatives. If John means to say that Justin “took with him” when\r\nhe removed to Vermont a two-year-old son of Beautiful Bay, that colt must\r\nhave been foaled in 1786, which would make him twelve years old instead\r\nof five when he was sold upon the death of his owner, and thirty-six\r\nyears old instead of twenty-nine when he died from a kick. Now, if we\r\nconcede that Justin did take with him a two-year-old son of Beautiful\r\nBay, the dates render it impossible that he should have been the founder\r\nof the Morgan horse family and we have no trace of him whatever.\r\n\r\nAnother authority has very recently come to the front, and in order to\r\navoid the difficulty of dates and still retain the possibility of the\r\nhorse being by Beautiful Bay, insists that he was foaled 1789 and bred\r\nby Justin Morgan himself. Under this new light he was foaled in Vermont\r\nand didn’t have to travel there at all. He insists further that he named\r\nthe horse Figure and kept him in the stud till his death in March, 1798,\r\nwhen the horse was sold and his name changed to Justin Morgan. It is\r\ntrue that Justin Morgan, still seeking to make a living, kept a stallion\r\ntwo or three years owned in Hartford, Connecticut, and advertised him as\r\n“the famous horse Figure, from Hartford.” Now, if this horse was foaled\r\nthe property of Justin Morgan and owned by him as long as he lived, why\r\nshould he advertise him as “from Hartford?” All these efforts to fix\r\ndates by shifting about so as to make it possible for the bogus stolen\r\nhorse to come in as a sire, have already received more attention than\r\ntheir importance demands and I will therefore call this the close of the\r\nthird chapter.\r\n\r\nThere are several incidents connected with the life of the colt of 1793\r\nthat fixed his identity and age upon the recollections of the neighbors\r\nand friends of Justin Morgan. Solomon Steele, Evans, Rice and others who\r\nknew the colt well, all agree that the colt followed his companion and\r\nplaymate from West Springfield to Randolph in the autumn of 1795 and\r\nthat he was not then halter broken. They all agree that Evans hired him\r\nfor fifteen dollars a year to draw logs in his clearing, in the place of\r\na yoke of oxen. They all agree that Justin Morgan died in March, 1798,\r\nand that the colt was then sold as a five-year-old. The death was an\r\nimmovable date fixer around which everything in connection with these\r\nevents must be determined. And when the horse died in 1821 nobody had\r\never doubted that he was foaled 1793.\r\n\r\nJustin Morgan, Jr., was in his tenth year when the colt was brought home,\r\nand he was twelve years old when his father died. In 1842 Justin Morgan,\r\nJr., in a communication to the Albany _Cultivator_, says: “One was a\r\nthree-year-old gelding colt, which he led; and the other a two-year-old\r\nstud colt, which followed all the way from Springfield. The said\r\ntwo-year-old colt was the same that has since been known all over New\r\nEngland by the name of the Morgan Horse. I know that my father always,\r\nwhile he lived, called him a Dutch horse. I have a perfect recollection\r\nof the horse when my father owned him and afterward, and well remember\r\nthat my father always spoke of him as of the best blood.”\r\n\r\nWhen he made these clean-cut and emphatic declarations Justin Morgan,\r\nJr., was fifty-six years old, and it has been suggested that he was too\r\nyoung, at the time, to have remembered about the colt. This is a grave\r\nmistake, for farmer’s boys remember a thousand things better then than\r\nthey ever do afterward. I don’t think that my own memory is remarkable,\r\nbut today, at over three score and ten, I can, with the utmost\r\ndistinctness, recall the names, color, markings, size, peculiarities\r\nand, in some cases, the history of most of the horses that were on the\r\nfarm when I was eight years old. I can, therefore, have no hesitation in\r\naccepting Justin Morgan’s evidence on account of his youthfulness, at the\r\ntime of which he speaks.\r\n\r\nDid Justin Morgan know what he was saying when he “always, while he\r\nlived, called his horse a Dutch horse?” And did he understand the\r\nhistorical meaning of his words when “he always spoke of him as of the\r\nbest blood?” To answer these questions we must make some reference to\r\nhistory. The Dutch horses were a breed wholly distinct from the horses\r\nof the other colonies. The colony of New Netherlands (New York) received\r\nits supply from Utrecht, in Holland, commencing in 1624 and a few years\r\nfollowing. In forty years they had so increased that the colony was well\r\nsupplied. These horses were about fourteen hands and one inch high,\r\nwhich was about one hand higher than the horses supplied to the English\r\ncolonies. They were not only higher, but they had more bone and muscle,\r\nand, I think, more shapely necks. In every respect they were better,\r\nexcept that they were not so good for the saddle, for the reason, as I\r\nthink, that they were not pacers. The standard that determined their\r\nsuperiority was the higher prices at which they were bought and sold,\r\nover the New England horses, as shown by the official reports of the\r\ncolony. When the colony passed under British rule, the first governor\r\nimmediately established a race course on Hempstead Plains, Long Island,\r\nand there in 1665 the first organized race in this country took place.\r\nThis was long before the English race horse had reached the character of\r\na breed, and a round hundred years before the first representative of\r\nthat breed reached New York. The horses that ran at Hempstead Plains were\r\nundoubtedly Dutch horses, for the inhabitants of New York and Long Island\r\nattended these annual meetings in great numbers, and as they were nearly\r\nall Dutch they would not have gone a stone’s throw to see an English\r\nhorse run. These annual race meetings were kept up a great many years by\r\nthe successive governors.\r\n\r\nIn 1635 two shiploads of Dutch horses, from the same quarter, chiefly\r\nmares, reached Salem, Massachusetts, and were sold at prices enormously\r\nhigh as compared with the prices of those sent from England to the same\r\ncolony. These two shiploads added materially to the average size of\r\nthe horses of the colony of Massachusetts Bay, as shown by statistics,\r\nas well as the other colonies getting their foundation stock from that\r\nsource. We may safely conclude, I think, that some of the descendants of\r\nthese shiploads were taken to the valley of the Connecticut when Hartford\r\nwas planted, for we not infrequently meet with the term “Dutch horse”\r\nin the old prints of that valley. Besides this source the valley of the\r\nHudson was full of them. They retained their distinctive appellation\r\ntill about the beginning of this century.\r\n\r\nMr. O. W. Cook, of Springfield, Massachusetts, did a great deal of\r\nfundamental investigation on the origin of this family, away back in\r\n1878-9, etc., and I am under special obligations to him for being the\r\nfirst man to open my eyes to the great confidence game that has been\r\nplayed for a hundred years, and all originating in the fabulous story of\r\n“one Smith.” Among other important things he unearths an advertisement\r\nof Young Bulrock that was advertised to stand at Springfield, 1792, as\r\nfollows: “Young Bulrock is a horse of the Dutch breed, of a large size,\r\nand a bright bay color, etc.” In speaking of his pedigree, Mr. Cook most\r\npithily remarks: “In view of the three-fold concurrence of time and place\r\nand breed, it fits into the vacuum in the Morgan’s lineage as a fragment\r\nof pottery fits into its complement.” There was another horse advertised\r\nin Springfield that year, but he had neither name nor breed and in color\r\nhe was gray. The advertisement of Young Bulrock fits in time, fits in\r\ncolor and fits in breed; and thus removes all reasonable doubt that\r\nhe was the sire of the original Morgan horse. This is the reason why\r\nJustin Morgan “always, while he lived, called him a Dutch horse;” and\r\nthe little scrap of history given above will show why he always spoke of\r\nhim as “of the best blood.” He was right in the former and he was right\r\nin the latter declaration. It is not possible, at this day, to prove,\r\ntechnically, these matters of a hundred years ago, but after considering\r\nall the facts in the case, we must conclude that they are satisfying to\r\nthe human understanding, and that Justin Morgan told the truth.\r\n\r\nFor the past fifty or sixty years the breeding of the original Morgan\r\nhorse has been a subject of apparently unending controversy. The real\r\nfacts concerning his origin, however, have never been brought to light\r\nand fully developed until within the last few years, and it is probable\r\nthat nothing of material value will ever be added to the foregoing\r\ntracing. We have found from contemporaneous history that Lieutenant\r\nWright Carpenter stole a horse from Colonel James De Lancey and was\r\nsuccessful in carrying him into the camp of the patriots at Fishkill, and\r\nthat is all we know about that particular horse. After the war was over\r\nit is stated that “one Smith” sold a horse to Mr. Ward, of Hartford, and\r\nrepresented that he had stolen the horse from Colonel De Lancey, and Mr.\r\nWard sold that horse to Selah Norton, who seems to have owned him as\r\nlong as he lived. It must be accepted as true that Lieutenant Carpenter\r\ncaptured a horse from Colonel De Lancey, but we cannot accept it as true\r\nthat this was the same horse owned by Norton. We must first know how and\r\nwhere “one Smith” got him. Norton had this horse and advertised him in\r\ndifferent parts of the country for public service seven or eight years\r\nbefore the romance of his history and pedigree was given to the world.\r\nAs this romance would have been a grand feature in an advertisement of a\r\nstallion, Mr. Norton was too slow in evolving it, and when he did bring\r\nit out nobody believed it. At that period many portions of New England\r\nabounded in stallions with bogus pedigrees and histories, and if we judge\r\nNorton by his acts in giving his horse three different names at different\r\ntimes and places, we must conclude he was ready to conceal or invent\r\nanything that would add to his horse’s popularity and patronage.\r\n\r\nSHERMAN MORGAN.—In his history of the Morgan Horse, Mr. Linsley names\r\nthis and three or four other sons of the original, that were kept for\r\nstock purposes, but none of them seems to have attained any eminence,\r\nexcept Sherman. As he never made any pretensions to being a trotter,\r\nhe would have been forgotten long ago, had it not been for the lucky\r\ncircumstances that he was the sire of Black Hawk, and thus his name\r\nhas been preserved. He was scant fourteen hands high, with heavy body\r\non short legs, and carried his head well up. He was a chestnut and\r\nfoaled about 1809. There has always been a doubt in the minds of many\r\nas to whether he was the sire of Black Hawk, but that question will\r\nbe considered when we reach that horse. His dam was a very handsome\r\nmare, brought from Narragansett, a pacer, and a very desirable saddle\r\nmare. In the trotting “Register,” three representations are given as to\r\nthe breeding of this mare, namely, that she was of the Spanish breed;\r\nthat she was an imported English mare; and that she was brought from\r\nVirginia on account of her beauty and speed. The first claim seemed to\r\nhave the best historical support, and besides this she was brought from\r\nProvidence, Rhode Island, and was a very fine pacer. The theory was then\r\nprevalent that the Narragansett pacers were of the “Spanish breed.” The\r\nelimination of that foolish notion from the history of the pacers does\r\nnot affect the plain statement that she was a Narragansett pacer. It is\r\nnot known that this mare ever produced anything else, either by the\r\noriginal Morgan or by any other horse.\r\n\r\nBLACK HAWK.—As his name indicates, this horse was a jet black, and was\r\nsomething over fifteen hands high. He was foaled 1833, was got by Sherman\r\nMorgan, and was bred by Benjamin Kelly, of Durham, New Hampshire. As the\r\nquestion of his paternity has been the subject of a great deal of bitter\r\ncontroversy, continued through many years, and participated in by men of\r\nintelligence, on both sides, I must give the history, as I understand it.\r\nMr. Kelly kept a tavern at Durham and Mr. Bellows, the owner of Sherman\r\nMorgan, made this house one of his points of stopping as he traveled his\r\nhorse, in his circuit of the season. Along with Sherman he had another\r\nhorse called Paddy, black as a raven, that did some service at seven\r\ndollars, while the price for Sherman was fourteen dollars. On one of\r\nhis visits, Mr. Kelly’s black mare, called “Old Narragansett” was bred\r\nto Sherman and proved to be in foal. Not long after this Mr. Kelly sold\r\nthe mare to Mr. Shade Twombly, living about two miles from Durham, and a\r\npart of the agreement was that if the mare should prove to be with foal,\r\nMr. Twombly was to pay for the services of the horse. The next spring\r\nthe mare dropped a fine black horse colt, and Mr. Twombly claimed the\r\ncolt was by Paddy and not by Sherman, hence, he refused to pay fourteen\r\ndollars for the services of Sherman, but was willing to pay seven dollars\r\nfor the services of Paddy. This resulted in a lawsuit in which it was\r\nproved that Sherman was the sire of the colt, and Mr. Twombly’s estate\r\nhad to pay the money. The colt was kept by Mr. Twombly’s heirs, at\r\npasture in Greenland, New Hampshire, till he was about two years old,\r\nwhen he was sold at auction to Albert Mathes, of Durham, for seventy\r\ndollars and from him he passed to Benjamin Thurston, of Lowell, for two\r\nhundred dollars. In Thurston’s hands he became quite noted, locally, as a\r\ntrotter, and in 1844 he became the property of David Hill, of Bridport,\r\nVermont, where he became altogether the most popular stallion in the\r\nUnited States, and died there November, 1856. He was the first horse to\r\ncommand one hundred dollars for his services; and many of the great mares\r\nof the country were sent to his embrace, among them the world-renowned\r\nLady Suffolk, but unfortunately she failed to produce.\r\n\r\nTo understand why the fight against the Sherman Morgan paternity of this\r\nhorse should have been so bitter and so persistent, we must consider the\r\ncondition of the horse interests in New England at that time. When Black\r\nHawk came to the front the Morgans of the real Morgan type had already\r\nattained some degree of popularity and here came a horse overtopping\r\nthem all, with no trace of the Morgan type about him. He and his family\r\nattracted the attention of purchasers and threw a shadow of doubt over\r\nthe little punchy, hairy-legged fellows that knocked out many a sale.\r\nBesides this, it was a serious and real question in the minds of a great\r\nmany honest and intelligent men, as to whether Sherman Morgan, so typical\r\nof his family, could possibly have been the sire of a horse so completely\r\noutside of the family, not only in appearance and formation, but in his\r\nability to trot. In 1847 Black Hawk was pitted against the Morse Horse,\r\nmile heats, best two in three, at the Saratoga State Fair. He won the\r\nfirst heat in 2:50½ and the second in 2:43½. He was then fourteen years\r\nold and this was very fast, for a stallion of that period. It is but\r\njustice to say that the Morse Horse contingent claimed that Black Hawk\r\nwas set back in the first heat for running and that the heat was given to\r\nthe Morse Horse in 2:52½ and that the second and third heats were won by\r\nBlack Hawk in 2:54½ and 2:56. Just what the truth is in this disagreement\r\nI am not able to determine. As we look at this horse, so distinct from\r\nall his tribe; and as we consider the very indistinct knowledge of the\r\nlaws of generation as held by the masses in that day, we cannot wonder\r\nthat the paternity was so vehemently disputed. Neither can we wonder, as\r\nhis descendants pass in review before us, that this dispute has never\r\nbeen settled to the satisfaction of the contending parties. The old\r\nMorgan type never reappears in the descendants of this family.\r\n\r\nBut, we must not forget that we have considered only half of the\r\ninheritance of this horse. He had a dam as well as a sire. To that\r\nhalf of his pedigree we must now give some attention. The story of the\r\n“half-bred English mare, brought from New Brunswick” has had its day\r\nand we may as well lay it aside as a humbug. Mr. Allen W. Thomson, of\r\nWoodstock, Vermont, has brought out the facts with regard to this mare in\r\na form that is very clear and satisfactory. In 1876 Mr. Thomson visited\r\nAlbany for the purpose of examining everything that had been said in _The\r\nCountry Gentleman_ newspaper touching on the paternity of Black Hawk. In\r\nthis search for the sire he would necessarily find many references to\r\nthe dam and among these references he was greatly surprised to find she\r\nhad been described as “a pacing mare.” He goes on to say: “In our visit\r\nthe same fall to Durham, Dover, Portsmouth and Greenland to learn more\r\nof her, we found a number that knew her when owned in Durham, and they\r\nsaid she was then known as the ‘Old Narragansett Mare.’ They said that\r\nBenjamin Kelly, deceased, brought the mare into Durham, that he had a\r\nson John L. living in Manchester, New Hampshire, and that he would know\r\nmore about her, etc.” After learning that Mr. John L. Kelly was a very\r\nintelligent and responsible man, having been city marshal and mayor of\r\nManchester, and known as “Honest John,” he wrote him and received the\r\nfollowing reply:\r\n\r\n    “In answer to your inquiries about the dam of Black Hawk, I\r\n    will give you my best recollections, aided somewhat by a diary\r\n    which I kept at that time. I returned to Durham from a sea\r\n    voyage in the fall of 1830. In the following spring I went to\r\n    Boston with my father with a lot of horses. We stopped over\r\n    night at Brown’s Hotel, at Haverhill, Mass., where we met a\r\n    teamster from Portsmouth, N. H., with a team of four horses. In\r\n    the hind span was a large gray horse and a dark bay mare. Among\r\n    father’s horses was one which was a good match for the gray\r\n    horse. The man noticed it and told father that the mare was too\r\n    fast for the horse, was worth two of him for speed and bottom,\r\n    yet he would trade with father for his gray horse. After a good\r\n    deal of talk, with the aid of Mr. Brown, the trade was made\r\n    and we drove the mare in the carriage to Boston, leading the\r\n    others. We found her to be a splendid roadster, and as she was\r\n    not in good condition to sell, we took her back to Durham. At\r\n    this time she was chafed and bruised up very badly with the\r\n    heavy harness, yet in a few months she came out of it, with no\r\n    traces of it, except a few white spots on her back and breast.\r\n    The teamster said she was a Narragansett mare. She would weigh\r\n    1,000 pounds. Father kept her as one of his stable horses. She\r\n    was found to have great speed as a trotter, and father was\r\n    always bragging about her. One day, late in the season, Israel\r\n    Esty, of Dover, drove up to Durham with a trotter, and bantered\r\n    father for a trot, mile heats on Madbury Plains, between Durham\r\n    and Dover. I had great faith in the mare and pleaded with\r\n    father to accept his offer, and he did, and fifty dollars was\r\n    staked on the race. John Speed was father’s hostler at the\r\n    time, and he commenced getting the mare ready for the race.\r\n    He had only three weeks to do it in. At the time specified, a\r\n    large collection of people from Dover and Durham collected to\r\n    witness the race. Dr. Reuben Steele was one of the judges. The\r\n    Esty horse won the first heat, the Kelly mare won the next two,\r\n    distancing the horse in the last one. In the spring of 1832\r\n    John Bellows came to Durham with the old Sherman Morgan, and\r\n    I persuaded father to have the mare bred to him. He did, as I\r\n    saw the horse cover her. I was 21 in 1832; went to sea again\r\n    that fall. My recollection of the dam of Black Hawk is she was\r\n    a very fine pointed dark mare, with a nostril so large, when\r\n    excited, that one could put his fist into it.\r\n\r\n                                                     JOHN L. KELLY.\r\n\r\n    “Manchester, N. H., August 25, 1876.”\r\n\r\nThe only “trip” in this letter is where Mr. Kelly speaks of the mare as\r\n“a dark bay,” but as the identity of the mare is fully maintained by\r\nother witnesses, this shade of color is not material and is, doubtless\r\na slip of the pen. We don’t know she was a Narragansett mare, but we\r\ndo know that she was called a Narragansett. It is wholly possible she\r\nmay have been a bastard Narragansett, or she may have been called a\r\nNarragansett merely because she was a pacer. At that date there were\r\nstill many descendants of the old Narragansetts to be found, of greater\r\nor less degree of purity in their breeding. Among Mr. Thomson’s gleanings\r\nfrom persons who knew the mare there are some bearing upon her color\r\nand gait that are in order at this point of our inquisition. Mr. John\r\nBellows, the owner of Sherman Morgan, says: “She was a good-sized black\r\nmare, a fast trotter, with a swinging gait, and resembled in appearance\r\nthe Messenger stock of horses.” The following description was gathered\r\nfrom several persons who knew the mare well and among them Mr. Wingate\r\nTwombly, son of her former owner. “She was a large, rangy mare, a little\r\ncoarse and brawny, did not carry much flesh, might have weighed some over\r\none thousand pounds and was a trifle over fifteen and one-half hands\r\nhigh. Head and ears rather large, neck long and straight, withers low and\r\nthin, medium mane and tail, had more hair on the fetlocks than her son,\r\nwas called black a little way off, but close to one could see her grey\r\nhairs mingled with her coat and close to she was called a steel mixed.\r\nShe had a white strip in her face and some say a little white on one hind\r\nfoot. She was smart to go, but her gait was not a smooth, square trot.\r\nSome called it a sort of a pace, others that she single-footed. She went\r\nwith her head low when trotting fast. One person said it was about a\r\nstraight line from her back to her head when she was going fast.” She was\r\ncalled the Narragansett Mare when Mr. Kelly owned her. From other sources\r\nand from men who personally knew the mare and had ridden beside her, we\r\nhave undoubted evidence that she was very fast, but all through there is\r\nsome confusion about the character of her gait. Mr. Bellows, who ought to\r\nknow something about the gait of a horse, says: “She was a fast trotter,\r\nwith a _swinging gait_.” Now just what he means by the phrase “swinging\r\ngait” is hard to determine. Putting all these bits of evidence together,\r\nthe reasonable conclusion seems to be that she was double-gaited, and\r\nwhen speeded she would go from the trot to the pace or from the pace to\r\nthe trot as the case might be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ETHAN ALLEN.\r\n\r\nSon of Vermont Black Hawk.]\r\n\r\nFrom this synopsis of all that has been developed in the blood lines\r\nof Black Hawk, there can be no longer any mystery about where he\r\ngot the characteristics making him so intensely different from the\r\nrepresentatives of the typical Morgan. His sire was out of a high-class\r\nNarragansett pacer, and his dam was probably a fast Narragansett pacer,\r\nthus giving him presumably seventy-five per cent. of Narragansett\r\nblood and twenty-five per cent. of Morgan blood. The fight that was\r\nmade against him all his life, as not being a genuine Morgan, had its\r\nfoundation in justice and truth. He was not a Morgan in either blood or\r\ncharacter. He founded a very valuable line of trotters, something that\r\nno other branch of the Morgan family has ever accomplished, and of right\r\nhis descendants should be designated as “the Black Hawk Family,” and\r\nnot jumbled up with the heterogeneous mass of nondescripts still called\r\n“the Morgan Family.” Black Hawk’s gait was spluttery and uneven, rather\r\nthan square and mechanical. A few of his progeny were very perfectly\r\ngaited, but a great many of them manifested their evil inheritance,\r\nwhich, together with unskillful handling, destroyed all possible value\r\nas trotters. He placed three in the 2:30 list; fourteen of his sons were\r\nsires of 2:30 performers, six of them with two or more, and two daughters\r\nproduced 2:30 performers. He died November, 1856.\r\n\r\nETHAN ALLEN, 43.—This was a handsome, bright bay horse, less than fifteen\r\nhands high, with three white feet and a star. He was foaled 1849, got by\r\nBlack Hawk, 5; dam, a fast trotting grey mare of unknown pedigree. With a\r\nlist of all the celebrated American horses before him, it would be very\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, for the best informed horseman to select\r\nan animal that has been so great a favorite with the American people,\r\nand for so long a time, as the famous Ethan Allen. When four years old\r\nhe gave the world a sensation by eclipsing everything that had appeared\r\nbefore him at that age; and again when he was eighteen years old he\r\nrenewed and intensified the sensation by trotting in 2:15 with a running\r\nmate. These sensations of his youth and his old age, did much to give\r\nhim a standing with the people; but his wonderful beauty and remarkable\r\ndocility and kindness, with the elegance and ease of his action, made him\r\nthe favorite of everybody. His trotting gait was recognized by the best\r\njudges and experts as probably more perfect than that of any horse of his\r\nday. Others have gone faster singly, but no one has done it in greater\r\nperfection of motion. In his great flights of speed he was not bounding\r\nin the air, but down close to the ground, with a gliding motion that\r\nsteals from quarter-pole to quarter-pole with inconceivable rapidity. He\r\nwas bred by Joel W. Holcomb, of Ticonderoga, New York, and as the result\r\nof a practical joke he played, for the purpose of annoying his uncle,\r\nDavid Hill, the owner of Black Hawk, against whom he had some pique just\r\nat that time, many well-meaning and no doubt honest people once believed,\r\nand possibly still believe, that Ethan Allen was by Flying Morgan and not\r\nby Black Hawk. The fact that Ethan Allen was the same color as Flying\r\nMorgan and that there was some resemblance in size and style of action\r\nof the two horses, lent a strong suggestion to the joke as a truth. I am\r\nindebted to Mr. I. V. Baker, Jr., of Comstock’s Landing, S. B. Woodward,\r\nthen of Ticonderoga, and B. H. Baldwin, of Whitehall, New York, for the\r\ndetails of the way the Flying Morgan story started, and need only say the\r\nnarrator was an eye-witness to the whole affair. In the spring of 1852,\r\nin the barroom of S. B. Woodward’s hotel, at Ticonderoga, quite a number\r\nof the villagers being present, Mr. Joel W. Holcomb came in and said\r\nhe was going to write a letter to R. M. Adams, of Burlington, Vermont,\r\nthe owner of Flying Morgan, and he was going to have some fun with him;\r\nand, going to the desk in the room, he wrote, substantially as follows:\r\n“I don’t know but I have made all the reputation for David Hill and old\r\nBlack Hawk that I care to. I am willing to have the credit go where it\r\nbelongs, and desire to let yourself and the public know that my colt\r\nEthan Allen is got by your horse Flying Morgan.”\r\n\r\n“There,” he said, “you will see this in all the Vermont papers next week.\r\nWon’t Uncle David be mad?”\r\n\r\n“What!” exclaimed some of his neighbors, after hearing it read, “you\r\nwon’t put your name to such a falsehood as that? It’s a shame.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said Holcomb, “I’ll add a postscript.” And going to the\r\ndesk he wrote below his signature, leaving a good wide space between his\r\nsignature and the following words:\r\n\r\n“Flying Morgan never covered the dam of Ethan Allen, never smelt of her\r\nand never saw her, consequently Ethan Allen was not by Flying Morgan,\r\nbut he can beat Flying Morgan or any other stallion in the State of\r\nVermont.”\r\n\r\nThe next fall Mr. Adams visited many of the fairs with his horse and\r\nshowed Holcomb’s letter, and, it is said, with the postscript torn off.\r\nEvery man in Ticonderoga knew as well as Mr. Holcomb how Ethan Allen\r\nwas bred, and this letter created much indignation. But Holcomb was a\r\nreckless man and cared for nothing more than what he called a good joke,\r\nand the more it hurt any one’s feelings the better it suited him.\r\n\r\nThis account of the “joke” was written down by Mr. Baker, at the\r\ndictation of Mr. Woodward, April 22, 1875, and I have implicit confidence\r\nin its substantial accuracy. It has been said that the reason Holcomb did\r\nthis was out of ill feeling toward Mr. David Hill, the owner of Black\r\nHawk, and Holcomb’s uncle, because he dunned him for payment of the\r\nhorse’s services in getting Ethan Allen. One day at the Fashion Course,\r\nin the spring of 1867, as I was looking at Ethan while he was taking\r\nhis daily exercise, either Mr. Holcomb or Mr. Roe, his partner—I knew\r\nthem both by sight as the owners of Ethan Allen, but not well enough to\r\ndistinguish one from the other, but I think it was Mr. Holcomb—came up to\r\nme and expressed a good deal of solicitude to know how I was registering\r\nthe horse. He appeared gratified when I assured him I had no doubt he\r\nwas a son of old Black Hawk and would so enter him. He remarked “that\r\nwas right,” and said the Flying Morgan story originated in a practical\r\njoke and should not be permitted to go into history as a fact. This is\r\nthe full history of the basis of the controversy, and certainly, to a\r\nreasonable man, it does not leave a single peg on which to hang a hope\r\nfor the Flying Morgan story.\r\n\r\nBut, the paternity of Ethan Allen is not left to the uncertainties of\r\nrecollection nor to be trifled with by practical jokers. The books of\r\nBlack Hawk’s services show that the dam of Ethan Allen was bred to him\r\non a certain day or days of the season of 1848, and was taken away\r\nbelieved to be in foal. This fact is conceded on all hands as wholly\r\nindisputable, but it is claimed that Flying Morgan was kept in Holcomb’s\r\nstable one night, after the mare returned from Bridport, and the two\r\nwere there surreptitiously coupled. I have studied this claim in all its\r\ndetails, I have examined every detail minutely, and I do not hesitate to\r\nsay there is not a single shadow of evidence to support the claim. In\r\nVermont, as in Kentucky, there are many people who can remember things\r\nthat never occurred, but in the former State these people are at a great\r\ndisadvantage, for they are not able to get so many to agree with and\r\nsupport their remarkable memories. The Vermonters are very far from being\r\nall honest, but they are very much disposed to make up their own minds,\r\nwhether right or wrong.\r\n\r\nIn searching for the breeding of the little flea-bitten grey mare,\r\n“called a Messenger,” that produced Ethan Allen, I have not been sparing\r\nof either time or labor. I have assiduously followed every clew that\r\npresented itself, and waded through “sloppy” correspondence “knee deep,”\r\nbut I never have been able to reach a single point that was relevant and\r\ntangible. From the first that is known of her at Hague, New York, her\r\nidentity has been maintained by a spavin on one leg and one hip knocked\r\ndown, and thus she has been traced through the hands of many owners till\r\nshe reaches Mr. Holcomb, of Ticonderoga, New York. A pretence has been\r\nset up that she was by some Morgan horse, but this was only a wish of the\r\noriginator, and not a fact founded on reasonable evidence. It is said\r\nshe was quite a fast trotter, in her younger days, and that she could\r\nbeat all the farmers’ horses against which she was started. That she had\r\na trotting inheritance, and probably from Messenger, there can be no\r\nreasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nEthan Allen made his first appearance as a trotter at the Clinton County\r\nFair, as a three-year-old, and made a record, over a very bad track, of\r\n3:20-3:21. In May following, then four years old, at the Union Course,\r\nhe beat Rose of Washington in 2:36-2:39-2:42. This was then the fastest\r\ntime ever made by a four-year-old. He then retired to the stud and did\r\nnot again appear till October, 1855, when, over the Cambridge Park\r\nCourse, he beat Columbus, Sherman Black Hawk, and Stockbridge Chief for\r\nthe stallion purse in 2:34½-2:37. Three of the contestants here were sons\r\nof Black Hawk. The next season he defeated Hiram Drew twice, to wagon,\r\nmaking a record of 2:32¾. October 15, 1858, at Boston, he beat Columbus\r\nJr., and Hiram Drew, 2:37-2:35-2:33. The same month, on the Union Course,\r\nhe beat George M. Patchen, to wagons, distancing him the first heat in\r\n2:28. At the Union Course, Long Island, July 12, 1860, he beat Princess,\r\ndistancing her the second heat in 2:29½-2:25½. This is his fastest\r\nrecord. He was frequently beaten by George M. Patchen, Flora Temple,\r\netc., and it was thought by many that he could not take up the weight\r\nand “hold the clip” for the full mile out. His most famous performance\r\nwas made in 1867, and as I had the pleasure of witnessing it, from a very\r\neligible position, I will here repeat the description as then made:\r\n\r\n“On the 21st of June, 1867, on the Fashion Course, it was my good fortune\r\nto witness the crowning event of his life. Some three weeks before, with\r\nrunning mate, he had beaten Brown George and running mate, in very fast\r\ntime, scoring one heat in 2:19. This made horsemen open their eyes, and\r\nthere at once arose a difference of opinion, about the advantage to\r\nthe trotter of having a runner hitched with him, to pull the weight.\r\nThis resulted in a match for two thousand five hundred dollars to trot\r\nEthan Allen and running mate against Dexter, who was then considered\r\ninvincible. As the day approached the betting was about even; but the\r\nevening before the race, word came from the course that Ethan’s running\r\nmate had fallen lame and could not go, but they would try to get Brown\r\nGeorge’s running mate, then in Connecticut, to take the place of the\r\nlame runner. As the horses were strangers to each other, it was justly\r\nconcluded that the change gave Dexter a great advantage and the betting\r\nat once changed from even to two to one on Dexter. Long before noon the\r\ncrowd began to assemble; the sporting men everywhere were shaking rolls\r\nof greenbacks over their heads, shouting “two to one on Dexter.” I met a\r\nfriend from Chicago, who sometimes speculated a little, and when he told\r\nme he was betting two to one on Dexter, I took the liberty of advising\r\nhim to be cautious, for I thought the team would win the race, and that\r\nits backers knew what they were doing. Before the hour arrived I secured\r\na seat on the ladies’ stand, from which every foot of the course, and\r\nthe countless multitudes of people, could be taken in at a glance. The\r\nvehicles in numbers were simply incalculable, and the multitudes were\r\nestimated at forty thousand people. Upon the arrival of the hour, the\r\njudges ascended the stand and rang up the horses, when the backers of the\r\nteam came forward, explained the mishap that had befallen the runner,\r\nthat they had Brown George’s mate on the ground, but, as he and Ethan\r\nhad never been hitched together, they were unwilling to risk so large a\r\nsum, and closed the race by paying one thousand two hundred and fifty\r\nforfeit. When this announcement was made there was a general murmur\r\nthat spread, step by step, through all that vast multitude. The betting\r\nfraternity were just where they started and every spectator realized a\r\nfeeling of disgust at the whole management. As soon as this had time to\r\nexert its intended effect upon the crowd, the backers of the team came\r\nforward again and expressed their unwillingness to have the people go\r\naway dissatisfied, and proposed a little match of two hundred and fifty\r\na side, which was promptly accepted by the Dexter party; and when it was\r\nknown there would be a race after all the shout of the multitudes was\r\nlike the voice of many waters.\r\n\r\n“This being a new race, the betting men had to commence _de novo_. The\r\nsurroundings of the pool stands were packed with an eager and excited\r\ncrowd, anxious to get on their money at two, and rather than miss, at\r\nthree to one on Dexter. The work of the auctioneers was short, sharp and\r\ndecisive, and the tickets were away up in the hundreds and oftentimes\r\nthousands. But the pool-stands did not seem to accommodate more than a\r\nsmall fraction of those anxious to invest, and in all directions in the\r\nsurging crowd, hands were in the air, filled with rolls of greenbacks,\r\nand shouting “two to one on Dexter.” I was curious to note what became\r\nof these noisy offers, and I soon observed that a quiet-looking man came\r\nalong, took all the party had to invest and then went quietly to another\r\nof the shouters, and then another and so on, till I think that every one\r\nwho had money to invest, at that rate, was accommodated. The amount of\r\nmoney bet was enormous, no doubt aggregating a quarter of a million, in a\r\nfew minutes.\r\n\r\n“When the horses appeared on the track to warm up for the race, Dexter,\r\ndriven by the accomplished reinsman Budd Doble, was greeted with a shout\r\nof applause. Soon the team appeared, and behind it sat the great master\r\nof trotting tactics, Dan Mace. His face, which has so often been a puzzle\r\nto thousands, had no mask over it on this occasion. It spoke only that\r\nintense earnestness that indicates the near approach of a supreme moment.\r\nThe team was hitched to a light skeleton wagon; Ethan wore breeching, and\r\nbeside him was a great strong race horse, fit to run for a man’s life.\r\nHis traces were long enough to allow him to fully extend himself, but\r\nthey were so much shorter than Ethan’s that he had to take the weight.\r\nDexter drew the inside, and on the first trial they got the send off\r\nwithout either one having six inches the advantage. When they got the\r\nword, the flight of speed was absolutely terrific, so far beyond anything\r\nI had ever witnessed in a trotting horse, that I felt the hair rising\r\non my head. The running horse was next to me, and notwithstanding my\r\nelevation, Ethan was stretched out so near the ground that I could see\r\nnothing of him but his ears. I fully believed that, for several rods at\r\nthis point, they were going at a two-minute gait.\r\n\r\n“It was impossible that this terrible pace could be maintained long, and\r\njust before reaching the first turn Dexter’s head began to swim and the\r\nteam passed him and took the track, reaching the first quarter-pole in\r\nthirty-two seconds, with Dexter three or four lengths behind. The same\r\nlightning speed was kept up through the second quarter, reaching the\r\nhalf-mile pole in 1:04, with Dexter still farther in the rear. Mace then\r\ntook a pull on his team, and came home a winner by six or eight lengths,\r\nin 2:15. When this time was put on the blackboard, the response of the\r\nmultitude was like the roar of the ocean. Although some distance away,\r\nthrough the second quarter of this heat I had a fair, unobstructed side\r\nview of the stallion and of his action, when going at the lightning rate\r\nof 2:08 to the mile. I could not observe that he received the slightest\r\ndegree of propulsion from the running horse; and my conviction was then,\r\nand is now, that any such propulsion would have interfered with his own\r\nunapproachable action, and would have retarded rather than helped him.\r\nThe most noticeable feature in his style of movement was the remarkable\r\nlowness to which he dropped his body and the straight, gliding line it\r\nmaintained at that elevation.\r\n\r\n“The team now had the inside, and in the first attempt they were started\r\nfor the second heat, but they did not appear to me to be going so fast as\r\nin the first heat. Before they had gone many rods Ethan lost his stride\r\nand Dexter took the track at the very spot where he had lost it in the\r\nfirst heat. The team soon got to work, and near the beginning of the\r\nsecond quarter collared Dexter, but the stallion broke soon after and\r\nfell back, not yards, nor lengths, but rods before he caught. Incredible\r\nas it may seem, when he again got his feet, he put on such a burst of\r\nspeed as to overhaul Dexter in the third quarter, when he broke again and\r\nMace had to pull him nearly to a standstill before he recovered. Dexter\r\nwas now a full distance ahead and the heat appeared to be his beyond all\r\nperadventure. I was watching the team in its troubles very closely and\r\nmy idea of the distance lost was the result of a deliberate and careful\r\nestimate at the moment; and the query in my mind then was whether the\r\nteam could save its distance. At last the old horse struck his gait, and\r\nit was like a dart out of a catapult, or a ball from a rifle. The team\r\nnot only saved its distance, but beat Dexter home five or six lengths in\r\n2:16.\r\n\r\n“In the third heat Mace had it all his own way throughout, coming home\r\nthe winner of the race in 2:19. The backers of Dexter, up to the very\r\nlast, placed great reliance on his well-known staying qualities; but\r\nthe last heat showed that the terrible struggle told upon him more\r\ndistressingly than upon the team. It is said by those who timed Dexter\r\nprivately that he trotted the three heats in 2:17, 2:18, and 2:21. As\r\nan opinion, I will say that if ever there was an honest race trotted\r\nthis was one, but there was such an exhibition of sharp diplomacy, of\r\nthe “diamond cut diamond” order, as is seldom witnessed, even among the\r\nsharp practices of the turf. It is not probable that Ethan’s running mate\r\nfell amiss at all, the evening before, as represented; and if she did,\r\nit was not possible to send to Connecticut for another horse and have\r\nhim there early in the morning as was pretended. This was a mere ruse\r\nput out to get the advantage of the long odds. The managers of the team\r\nknew just how the horses would work and knew they had speed enough to\r\nbeat any horse on earth. When the race was called and they came forward\r\nand paid forfeit, it was merely to give the ‘two to one on Dexter’ money\r\nencouragement to come out. It did come out most vociferously and was all\r\nquietly taken. It was said John Morrissey was the manager in chief, and\r\nthat his share of the winnings amounted to about forty thousand dollars.”\r\n\r\nI have here given my personal impressions of this race, not because the\r\nperformance was of any special value, as a test of speed, but because\r\nthe time was then phenomenal, even with this kind of hitch, and as an\r\nillustration of what certain horses can do when relieved of all weight.\r\nThis was among the first of the contests of this kind, and although\r\nsome effort was made to introduce this plan by which a poor horse could\r\nbeat a good one, it never has received much encouragement. With all his\r\nperfection of gait and wide popularity, extending from early life to old\r\nage, Ethan Allen was not a success as a progenitor of speed. He placed\r\nbut six in the 2:30 list, and the best—Billy Barr—with a record of 2:23¾.\r\nHe left but one son equal to himself as a sire, and several daughters\r\nthat became the producers of single performers. He was kept several\r\nseasons in Kansas and died there September, 1876.\r\n\r\nDANIEL LAMBERT, 102, was a chestnut horse, foaled 1858; got by Ethan\r\nAllen, 43; dam Fanny Cook, by Abdallah; grandam by Stockholm’s American\r\nStar, etc. His color was a light chestnut, and his mane and tail were of\r\nthe yellow, flaxen shade. He was about fifteen hands high and long and\r\nlight in the body, with no indications of Morgan blood about him unless\r\nit was in the kinkiness of his mane and tail. But why should he not\r\nresemble almost anything else than the little nondescript Morgan, when he\r\nhad only one-sixteenth of his blood in his veins? He had more Messenger\r\nthan Morgan blood, and according to the rules of arithmetic it is a\r\nmisnomer to call him a Morgan. More than this, his dam was a daughter\r\nof the great Abdallah, far and away the greatest trotting sire of his\r\ngeneration. When we consider that he had four times as much of the blood\r\nof Abdallah as he had of the original Morgan, we can see the absurdity\r\nof sticking to the right male line after that line has been wiped out by\r\nother lines far more potential. Lambert was bred by Mr. John Porter of\r\nTiconderoga, New York, and as a colt he showed great promise on the ice,\r\nand was thought to be the fastest and best of the get of Ethan Allen. He\r\nwas known far and wide as the “Porter Colt,” and he was the popular heir\r\nto very great expectations. To have created so much enthusiasm he must\r\nhave shown great speed for a youngster, and he is credited with a record\r\nof 2:42 as a three-year-old. As a sire of trotters he stood very high at\r\none time and was even with Blue Bull in his number of representatives in\r\nthe 2:30 list, but in the end the little “plebeian” pacer outstripped him\r\na long way. Lambert put thirty-seven trotters into the 2:30 list, but\r\nwhen we come to study this list we are not very favorably impressed, for\r\nabout one-third of the animals have but a single heat inside of the mark,\r\nwith only five or six reputable campaigners and a single one—Comee—that\r\nranked among the real good ones. Comee had seventy-one heats to his\r\ncredit and a record of 2:21¼. Thirty-three of Daniel Lambert’s sons\r\nhave put one hundred and thirty-six in the list, and forty-four of his\r\ndaughters have produced seventy-four performers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ORLOFF TROTTER, BELLFOUNDER, AND THE ENGLISH HACKNEY.\r\n\r\n    Orloffs the only foreign trotters of merit—Count Alexis\r\n    Orloff, founder of the breed—Origin of the Orloff—Count Orloff\r\n    began breeding in 1770—Smetanka, Polkan, and Polkan’s son,\r\n    Barss, really the first Orloff trotting sire—The Russian\r\n    pacers—Their great speed—Imported Bellfounder—His history\r\n    and characteristics—Got little speed—His descendants—The\r\n    English Hackney—Not a breed, but a mere type—The old Norfolk\r\n    trotters—Hackney experiments in America—Superiority of the\r\n    trotting-bred horse demonstrated in show-ring contests.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be a little outside of the field of our discussion to include the\r\nOrloff Trotter, but as a few of them have been brought to this country,\r\nand as that is the only organized and recognized _breed_ of trotters in\r\nall the world beside our own, it seems to be necessary to give a brief\r\nsynopsis of the origin and history of that breed, so far as we may be\r\nable. An additional and probably a more cogent reason for making this\r\nforeign detour is the fact that there are now many American trotters on\r\nthe turf in Europe, and practically their only competitors, whether on\r\nthe turf or in the breeding studs, are the Orloffs of Russia.\r\n\r\n“Wallace’s American Trotting Register,” the first volume of which was\r\nissued in 1871, was an individual enterprise. Two years afterward the\r\ndirector-in-chief of the Russian Imperial Studs submitted a series of\r\nquestions to different scientific gentlemen, whose studies were in\r\nthe right direction, soliciting their views, on the practicability\r\nand advisability of establishing a governmental standard by which the\r\nOrloff trotters should be classed and officially registered. The report\r\nwas favorable and the Russian trotting register was established under\r\ngovernmental direction. This was the second movement toward establishing\r\na _breed_; not merely by writing a lot of names in a book, but by writing\r\nthose names on the turf of two continents. A delegation from France once\r\nvisited me to consult about establishing a Register in that country,\r\nand to learn how to commence such an enterprise. When I asked them what\r\nstrains of blood they had that could trot, they did not seem to know of\r\nany particular strains, or any one strain better than another, to serve\r\nas a foundation, but they were sure they had plenty of trotters. This was\r\nthe first I ever had heard of French-bred trotters, and it was the last I\r\never heard of the French trotting register.\r\n\r\nThe stalwart Alexis Orloff took a very active part in making Catherine\r\nII. Empress of Russia—for which he was loaded with honors as well as\r\nlucrative offices. In the war with the Turks in 1772 he was given command\r\nof the Russian fleet, and with the assistance of the English fleet\r\nunder Admiral Elphinstone, he achieved a great victory and captured the\r\npasha in command of the Turkish fleet. Owing to some unusual kindness\r\nCount Orloff was able to extend to the captured Turkish commander, or\r\nhis family, he presented the count with a pure white stallion, said\r\nto be a Barb, which he took home with him and placed in his stud of\r\nhorses, that he had established but a short time before. Another story\r\nis that the count bought this white horse, which he called Smetanka,\r\nwhile he was in Greece and paid a large price for him. I am not able to\r\nsay which representation is the more probable, and it is not material\r\nto our history, as there is no dispute about the identity of Smetanka\r\nas the nominal head of the Orloff breed of horses, and neither story\r\ngives any information about his blood. No doubt he was a Turk. Count\r\nAlexis commenced his breeding stud in 1770, and there appears to have\r\nbeen a good deal of system about it or else a large amount of very free\r\nguessing. When first established, the horse breeders say, it consisted of\r\nstallions and mares as follows: Arabs, 12 stallions, 10 mares; Turkish,\r\n1 stallion, 2 mares; English, 20 stallions, 32 mares; Dutch, 1 stallion,\r\n8 mares; Persian, 3 stallions, 2 mares; Danish, 1 stallion, 3 mares;\r\nMecklenburg, 1 stallion, 5 mares. From this it will be seen that he had\r\nmore English running blood than all the other varieties put together,\r\nand yet no trotters came from that source. From this great variety of\r\ncomposite material the count had free rein in his grand experiment of\r\nproducing the type of horse that best pleased his fancy. As a matter of\r\ncourse the indiscriminate commingling of these different strains and\r\ntypes would produce a mongrel lot, from which a few superior animals\r\nmight be selected, and doubtless were selected, for breeding purposes.\r\n\r\nThe different writers who have discussed the result of this experiment\r\nseem to agree, substantially, that two distinct types were the\r\nresult—the galloper for the saddle and the trotter for harness—but they\r\nassume what appears to me to be a very unreasonable conclusion that both\r\nthese types were indebted to the super-excellence of Smetanka. The count\r\nwas one of the most prominent sporting men of his day, an inveterate\r\nhorse-racer and cock-fighter, and under this kind of management it is\r\nhardly credible that the twenty English thoroughbred stallions should\r\nhave been put aside for the little white horse of positively unknown\r\norigin. But whatever may have been the predominating blood in the saddle\r\ndepartment, it is certain that the trotter is lineally descended from\r\nSmetanka. He was bred on a Danish mare and produced Polkan (Volcan),\r\nwithout anything new or striking in his characteristics. Polkan was bred\r\non a Dutch mare and produced Barss, and this was the first to manifest a\r\ndisposition to extend himself to his utmost at the trot and to stick to\r\nit. Barss became a great favorite with his master; for, although stumbled\r\nupon, he was a new creation and is the real progenitor of all the horses\r\nthat bear the name Orloff. His component elements are easily expressed.\r\nHe had twenty-five per cent. of the blood of Smetanka; twenty-five per\r\ncent. of the blood of the Danish mare, and fifty per cent. of the blood\r\nof the Dutch mare, it seems to be reasonable to conclude, therefore, that\r\nthe trotting instinct must be found in the unknown elements of the Dutch\r\nmare.\r\n\r\nSome years ago Prof. —— (the name I cannot now recall), from the Imperial\r\nAgricultural College, near Moscow, Russia, paid me several visits for\r\nthe purpose of gathering up what information he could obtain about the\r\norigin and history of the American Trotter. He was very intelligent and\r\nthorough in his methods of obtaining information, and each succeeding day\r\nhe came back to me with a new series of questions hinging upon previous\r\ninterviews, and all carefully prepared. These questions were so admirably\r\nshaped to reach the vital points of the subject that I became greatly\r\ninterested in the man. When it came my turn to ask questions, my first\r\none was, What was the origin and lineage of the Dutch mare that produced\r\nBarss? He replied, “Ah, the scientific men of Russia would give a great\r\ndeal to be able to answer that question.” We both agreed, perfectly, that\r\nthe living instinct of the trotter came from that mare, but he was not\r\nable to tell me anything of her history or habits of action. He told me\r\nthere were many pacers in Russia and that the best ones came from the\r\nprovince of Viatka and from the region of the Volga River.\r\n\r\nAs the true source from which the Russian trotters have drawn their\r\nability to trot fast has not been developed nor determined by history, we\r\nmust consider the problem in the light of the surrounding conditions, and\r\npossibly our American experiences may lead to its solution. In 1873 Prof.\r\nVon Mittendorf, at the request of the director-in-chief of the imperial\r\nstud, prepared a very able paper on the scientific questions involved\r\nin the establishment of a Government Register for the Orloff trotters.\r\nIn this paper he discusses the pace and the trot as both original and\r\nnatural gaits and insists that there are no outward indications in form\r\nor shape by which the animal, when at rest, can be decided to be a pacer\r\nor a trotter. In his own words he says:\r\n\r\n    “In answer to the question whether, from the form of a horse\r\n    at rest, it can be ascertained what gait would be easiest\r\n    assumed by it, viz., trotting or pacing, I must confess that\r\n    I have never seen, read or heard of such marks, and, indeed,\r\n    there never are any symptoms or signs of inclination for pacing\r\n    in the proportions of any horse with the single negative\r\n    exception, viz., that great speed in one-sided motion does not\r\n    agree with a large frame, which is more adapted to leaping, and\r\n    hence fast pacers are never found among large horses.”\r\n\r\nThis is the view as taken by a Russian scientist of the distinction, or\r\nrather lack of distinction, between the trotter and the pacer. I have\r\nnot quoted this paragraph from Prof. Mittendorf because it contained\r\nanything new in the economy of breeding, but to prove that there were\r\npacers in Russia and that their relation to the trotter was considered in\r\nthe formation of the rules of admission to the Orloff trotting register.\r\nA very intelligent writer, evidently a Russian and one who knew what he\r\nwas talking about, contributed an interesting article to the New York\r\n_Sun_ of July 9, 1877, from which we get a clear and strong light on the\r\npractical side of the Russian pacer, and I will here again quote:\r\n\r\n    “Up to the middle of the last century horses in Russia were\r\n    not scientifically bred; they ran wild in many parts of the\r\n    country. Those caught on the steppes of the river Don, and\r\n    in the wilderness of the district of Viatka, obtained early\r\n    celebrity, which they still maintain. The Don horses are those\r\n    famous Cossack steeds about which so much has been written of\r\n    late. The Viatka horses, or Bitugues, as they are called are\r\n    the genuine trotters of Russia. They are all pacers, equally\r\n    remarkable for their speed and their endurance. But since\r\n    the Orloff breed has been introduced, the Bitugues have been\r\n    excluded from all matches, on the ground that their pacing is\r\n    not orthodox.\r\n\r\n    “It is with these Bitugues that the peculiar troika team, of\r\n    which a specimen was shown in Fleetwood Park, on Saturday,\r\n    originated. A fast, sturdy Bitugue is put in shafts, and a\r\n    light running horse from the steppes harnessed on each side of\r\n    him. A good Bitugue trots so fast that the wild steppe runners\r\n    have to be whipped all the time to force them to keep up with\r\n    him. The idea of putting an Orloff trotter in the place of a\r\n    Bitugue is very queer, as no square trotter can equal the speed\r\n    of those famous pacers of Viatka, and keep abreast with side\r\n    runners.”\r\n\r\nFrom these three several sources we learn a number of facts that may\r\nhave a more or less important bearing upon the true origin of the Orloff\r\ntrotter. (1) That there are now, and have been for generations past,\r\nplenty of pacers in Russia. (2) That these pacers have a common habitat,\r\nnorth and east of the Don. (3) That they are a very old race, running\r\nback in the centuries away beyond the knowledge of man or the records of\r\nhistory. (4) That they are a very fast and very enduring race, and that\r\nthey have been trained for generations as the shaft horses of the troika\r\nand their speed so well developed as to require good running horses\r\nto keep abreast with them. (5) That they are of smaller size than the\r\naverage and lack symmetry, and thus, notwithstanding their great speed\r\nand bottom, they and their blood are excluded from registration with the\r\nOrloffs. (6) That they are also excluded from competing for any prizes\r\nthat may be offered, and no other reason is suggested than that they\r\nwould be sure to win.\r\n\r\nRussia and America both have pacers and they are both carrying forward\r\nthe breeding and development of the trotter with great intelligence and\r\nsuccess. No other nation has been able to make even a beginning in this\r\nfield of animal economy except by the introduction of the foundation\r\nstock from one or other of these two countries. It may be taken as\r\nhistorically true, and as applying to every nation on the face of the\r\nearth, that where there are no pacers there are no trotters. Hundreds of\r\nunmistakable experiences in this country go to show that the pacer is a\r\ngreat source of trotting speed. At one time a pacing stallion of obscure\r\npacing origin stood at the head of the list of all stallions as the sire\r\nof the greatest number of trotters with fast records. A great multitude\r\nof our fastest trotters at maturity were foaled pacers from trotting\r\nparents. It is no longer a matter of wonder or surprise that with two\r\nanimals from the same parents one of them should be a fast trotter and\r\nthe other a fast pacer. Neither is it any longer remarkable that a fast\r\ntrotter with a very fast record should turn around and make just as fast\r\na record at the pace. The American people are just beginning to realize,\r\nin its full force, the declaration of more than twenty years ago; that\r\nthe trot and the pace are simply two forms of the same gait, in the\r\neconomy of motion. The only difference that has been observed as between\r\ntwo brothers, the one a pacer and the other a trotter, is that with the\r\nsame skill in handling the pacer will come to his speed much quicker than\r\nthe trotter, which is of itself a strong suggestion at least that the\r\npace is the more natural and easier form of the one gait.\r\n\r\nNow, in view of the fact that Smetanka was of Saracenic origin—a strain\r\nof blood that has always been antagonistic to the pacer, and never\r\nproduced a pacer or a trotter; and in view of the fact that his grandson,\r\nBarss, is accepted as the first of all Orloff trotters; and in view of\r\nthe further fact that in thousands of American experiences the trotter\r\nhas come from the pacer, it seems to be a reasonable conclusion that the\r\n“Dutch Mare” that produced Barss had a strong pacing inheritance, and\r\npossibly had her speed fully developed, as the Bitugue in the count’s own\r\nteam.\r\n\r\nAmong all the pleasures which Count Orloff derived from his experiments\r\nin breeding, whether of gamecocks, or race horses, or saddlers, or\r\ntrotters, Barss was his greatest favorite because he was his highest\r\nachievement in the art of breeding. This judgment of his master has been\r\nconfirmed in the experiences and history of all succeeding generations\r\nfor a hundred years, and the name of Barss will be known through the\r\ncoming centuries as the founder of a mighty breed of trotters. I once\r\npossessed a fine picture of Barss hitched to a sleigh and driven by his\r\nbreeder, Count Orloff, himself; and I have seen it stated somewhere that\r\nthis picture was a copy of a bronze statue erected to the memory of the\r\nCount Orloff and the greatest horse of Russia.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated by some writers, but with what measure of authority\r\nI do not know, that for about thirty years after the appearance of\r\nBarss his daughters were bred to English thoroughbreds, to Arabs, to\r\nAnglo-Arabs, and, indeed, to all the highly bred crosses that the great\r\nestablishment was able to furnish, and there was no improvement in either\r\nthe quality or the speed of the produce. From this it is evident that\r\nthe count and his managers were at that period entangled in the same\r\nfoolish notions that befogged the minds of so many very worthy gentlemen\r\nin this country some years ago, viz., that the way to improve the trotter\r\nwas to go to the runner—the horse that never could trot. This foolish\r\nnotion, that never had a spark of reason in it, naturally and necessarily\r\nweakened the trotting instinct of the descendants of Barss, and would\r\nhave wiped it all out if it had been followed persistently, and there\r\nwould have been no Orloff trotters to-day.\r\n\r\nAfter this narrow escape from the annihilation of much of the good that\r\nBarss had done, the management then began to look for the same blood and\r\nthe same habit of action that the “Dutch Mare” transmitted to her son,\r\nand, with this element to the front, progression was resumed. Out of his\r\ngreat variety of forms and of strains of blood the count and his managers\r\ncould pick and choose for the size, shape and forms they wanted, but they\r\nwere not able to transfer with the size, shape and form the instincts and\r\npsychical nature of the horse. The count seems to have carried forward\r\nhis great enterprise rather with a view to experimentation than its\r\ncommercial possibilities. Smetanka lived but a year or two, and when\r\nhe stumbled upon the production of Barss, a magnificent individual and\r\na great trotter, his head seems to have been turned, as he evidently\r\nsupposed that he could breed any kind of horse he wished to breed, and\r\nbe able to do anything he wished him to do. At his death, in 1808, he\r\nleft no male heir to succeed him, but he provided in his will that his\r\nstud should not be dispersed. It was kept intact till about 1845, when it\r\nwas purchased by the government, and finally divided among a number of\r\nprominent breeders in different portions of the empire.\r\n\r\nWithout having any knowledge on the subject that is definite and\r\nspecific, I am led to infer that the rules on registration and racing in\r\nRussia are a hindrance to the breeding and development of the trotter.\r\nAs I understand it, no horse can be registered unless he is purely\r\ndescended from Barss. And I understand further, that he must possess\r\nthe same requirements in order to enter and start in a public race\r\nagainst the Orloffs. If it be true that these restrictions are really in\r\nexistence and are enforced, we can understand why the American trotter is\r\nso far ahead of the Orloff in speed and in the markets of Europe. The\r\nOrloff is restricted to certain lines of blood and is protected against\r\ncompetition from others that might beat him. The American is free from\r\nall restrictions of blood and gathers up all that is best and fastest. He\r\nneither asks nor accepts protection from any quarter, but throws down the\r\nglove to all comers.\r\n\r\nBELLFOUNDER was imported from England, July, 1822, by James Boott, of\r\nBoston, Mass. He was placed in the hands of Samuel Jaques, Jr.—a very\r\nshrewd manager who understood the use of printer’s ink and did not\r\nhesitate about employing it liberally. In his advertisement for 1823 he\r\nsays: “This celebrated horse is a bright bay with black legs, standing\r\nfifteen hands high.” From this we are safe in concluding he was not\r\nmore than fifteen hands, and from another contemporaneous source it\r\nis learned that he was a little below that measurement. On this point\r\nthe recollections, or perhaps impressions, of Orange County horsemen\r\nare not very trustworthy, as one of them places his height at sixteen\r\nhands and others at fifteen and a half. His pedigree was given on the\r\ncard which was distributed by his groom in the form following: “Got\r\nby old Bellfounder, out of Velocity by Haphazard, by Sir Peter out\r\nof Miss Hervey by Eclipse.” “Velocity trotted on the Norwich road in\r\n1806, sixteen miles in one hour, and although she broke five times\r\ninto a gallop, and as often turned round, she won her match.” Although\r\nafter diligent search I have not been able to find this performance\r\nof Velocity, it may be true that a mare so named may have trotted as\r\nrepresented, but she was not a daughter of Haphazard. The dates make this\r\nutterly impossible, and Mr. Jaques was smart enough never to put this\r\nhumbug pedigree in his elaborate advertisements that appeared in the\r\nleading agricultural papers of the country, year after year.\r\n\r\nAs the great mass of people of that day knew nothing and cared but little\r\nabout pedigrees, the astute manager of the horse struck an expedient in\r\nthe way of advertising that was very effective. He had a cut made of a\r\nhorse trotting loose on the road, at the rate of a hurricane, and in\r\nthe background was an entablature with the legend “Seventeen and a half\r\nmiles an hour,” which anybody and everybody would interpret to mean that\r\nthis was a record made by imported Bellfounder, and there he was doing\r\nit. This cut in reduced form went the rounds of the agricultural press,\r\nand in 1831 made its appearance in the “Family Encyclopedia of Useful\r\nKnowledge.” This dodge was exceedingly effective, and as it appeared in\r\na book it must be true. Thousands of people interpreted the picture to\r\nmean that imported Bellfounder had trotted seventeen and a half miles\r\nin an hour. Mr. Jaques did not say this in letters and figures, but he\r\nsaid it even more plainly in a picture. The basis of this deception is\r\nfound in the advertisement itself, where, in speaking of the speed of old\r\nBellfounder in England, he says: “His owner challenged to perform with\r\nhim seventeen miles and a half in one hour, but it was not accepted.”\r\nHere we have a possible challenge of the sire transmuted into an actual\r\nperformance of the son, for the sole purpose of securing public patronage.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that this horse was a true representative of what\r\nwas then known as the Norfolk Trotters and at this time designated as\r\nHackneys or Cobs. Bellfounder was of a quiet, docile disposition, with a\r\ndisplay of great nervous energy in his movements when aroused. His knee\r\nand hock action was high and showy, giving the impression of a great\r\ntrotter, without much speed. At several points his form was measurably\r\nreproduced in Hambletonian, especially in his low, round withers and his\r\ngreat, meaty buttocks. In seeing these points so plainly developed in his\r\nidol it is not remarkable that Mr. Rysdyk should have placed too high an\r\nestimate on Bellfounder blood as a factor in the American trotting horse.\r\nIf he had thoughtfully asked himself the question, What has Bellfounder\r\nblood done in its own right in the way of getting trotters? the illusion\r\nwould have vanished.\r\n\r\nBellfounder was in the control of Mr. Jaques for six years, and never\r\nin my knowledge of trotting stallions have I known one so widely and\r\nsuccessfully advertised. The name “Bellfounder” was heard and known\r\neverywhere. From 1829 to 1833, inclusive, he was under the control of\r\nMr. T. T. Kissam, of Long Island. After that time he seems to have gone\r\n“a-begging” wherever there seemed to be a chance to earn his oats. At\r\nlast, at Jamaica, Long Island, he died, having made twenty-one seasons\r\nin this country—one more than Messenger. The question was once raised\r\nas to where Hambletonian got his aversion to the chestnut color, and it\r\nwas flippantly assigned to Bellfounder. The truth is, quite a number of\r\nBellfounder’s get were chestnuts, perhaps as large a percentage as would\r\nnaturally come from the average stallion.\r\n\r\nIt is the testimony of several gentlemen who were familiar with trotting\r\naffairs in the time of the Bellfounders, that a number of them were\r\nskillfully and persistently trained and none of them could trot faster\r\nthan about 2:50. The one exception to this fact so widely established\r\nis the case of the dam of Hambletonian. After this filly passed into\r\nthe hands of Peter Seely he gave some attention irregularly to the\r\ndevelopment of her speed, and before he sold her he gave her two trials\r\nto saddle on the Union Course and she trotted in 2:43 and 2:41. As she\r\nwas then but four years old it is safe to conclude that she would have\r\nmade a trotter, beyond all doubt. This is the only one, old or young,\r\nfrom the loins of Bellfounder that ever trotted so fast. I once put the\r\nquestion directly to Mr. Rysdyk as to whether the Kent Mare was as good\r\nand as fast as her dam, One Eye, and he promptly replied that One Eye was\r\nmuch the faster and greater mare. To this answer he added that One Eye,\r\nunder the same circumstances, would have been the equal of Lady Thorn or\r\nany other that ever lived. This may account for the superiority of the\r\nKent Mare over all the other Bellfounders, and it may account for the\r\nsuperiority of Hambletonian over all other stallions.\r\n\r\nBELLFOUNDER (BROWN’S OR KISSAM’S), was a bay horse, foaled 1830, got by\r\nimported Bellfounder; dam Lady Alport, by Mambrino, son of Messenger;\r\ngrandam by Tippoo, son of Messenger; great-grandam by imported Messenger.\r\nWith such breeding he should have been a great horse. He was bred by\r\nTimothy T. Kissam, of Long Island, and sold along with a full brother one\r\nyear younger, named Bellport, about 1834-5, to L. F. and A. B. Allen,\r\nof Buffalo, New York. Bellfounder was a bay horse, sixteen hands high,\r\nand Bellport was sixteen and one-half hands, but was poisoned and died\r\nat four years old. Bellfounder passed into the hands of some parties at\r\nCleveland and then to Mr. Brown, of Columbus, Ohio, made most of his\r\nseasons in that portion of the State, and died September, 1860. This was\r\naltogether the most valuable son the imported horse left—indeed the only\r\none that made any mark in the world. He was not much of a trotter and did\r\nnot get trotters, but got colts that were excellent types of the coach\r\nhorse, and for that purpose was very highly esteemed. Some of his sons\r\nand daughters, especially the latter, are met with sometimes in trotting\r\nrecords as having produced something that had more or less speed.\r\n\r\nCONQUEROR was a bay gelding, foaled 1842, and got by La Tourrett’s\r\nBellfounder, a grandson of the imported horse, and out of Lady McClain by\r\nimported Bellfounder, and she out of Lady Webber by Mambrino, and she out\r\nof a mare brought from Dutchess County and represented to be a daughter\r\nof imported Messenger. This gelding had been pounded about in slow races\r\nfor years and had the reputation of being a stayer. In 1853 a match\r\nwas made with him to trot a hundred miles in nine hours. The race was\r\nstarted and the horse won in 8h. 55m. and 53s., and he died three or four\r\ndays afterward. This is the only instance that I know of in which the\r\nadvocates of Hackney blood can point to a trotting record made in this or\r\nindeed in any other country.\r\n\r\nIn closing the account of this family—for out of courtesy we have called\r\nit a “family”—we find we have nothing left but a name with nothing in it.\r\nThe name that was more widely known than that of any other horse of his\r\ngeneration has now practically ceased from the earth, with nobody so poor\r\nas to do it reverence.\r\n\r\nThe type of horse now known as the “Hackney” is found chiefly in the\r\nshires bordering the northeastern coast of England—Norfolk, Lincoln and\r\nYorkshire. The name now given is not only new but it is appropriate and\r\napplies to any one part of England as well as another, and applies to any\r\none horse, suited to the general use of a Hack, as well as another, no\r\ndifference what his blood or what his country. The name “Norfolk Trotter”\r\nfifty or a hundred years ago was often applied to horses of this type\r\ncoming from that part of the country, but it did not follow that they\r\nwere “trotters.” In the discussions of the association preceding the\r\nadoption of a name it was urged that the qualifying word “trotter” would\r\nimply the ability to trot fast, and as the material to be registered\r\ncould not do this, it would subject the whole movement to ridicule and\r\ncontempt. It was also urged that the name “Norfolk” would give that\r\nparticular region an advantage over all other parts of England in the\r\nprospective sales of registered stock, and thus the old title was fully\r\ndisposed of. When the name “cob” was suggested, it was conceded that it\r\nrepresented just what they had, but it was too common, as everybody in\r\nall England, rich and poor, had “cobs.” Then came the term “Hackney,”\r\nwhich meant the same kind of a horse as the cob, but as it was not in\r\nsuch universal use it was adopted. On this point it must be admitted\r\nthat it is an honest name.\r\n\r\nThe Hackney is a good horse for all the uses to which he is adapted. He\r\nis short on his legs and stout, with a good share of nervous energy. He\r\nis symmetrical, and, we might say, handsome, if we can use that word\r\nwithout any show of fine breeding, for he is far short of the ideal blood\r\nhorse. But he is not a saddle horse, he is not a hunter, he is not a\r\nrunner, and he is not a trotter. As against these desirable and useful\r\nqualifications, he has been bred and trained when in action to jerk up\r\nhis limbs to the highest point anatomically possible, and put them down\r\nagain with a thud at a point but little removed from where he started. In\r\nthis showy, undesirable action he exhausts his nervous energy, pounding\r\nthe earth without covering much of the distance. In this excessive knee\r\naction every element of easy, graceful and rapid progression is wanting.\r\nThis fad will have its day and then along with the barbarous excision of\r\nthe caudal appendage they will disappear together as they came, and we\r\nwill know them no more forever.\r\n\r\nThere are two points in advocating the merits of the Hackney with which\r\nevery Englishman is thoroughly familiar and which he will call to your\r\nattention on the slightest provocation: (1) Bellfounder was a Hackney and\r\nit was his blood that gave us the greatest trotting sire that the world\r\nhas ever produced. This is the Englishman’s estimate of Bellfounder when\r\nhe has a Hackney for sale, and especially if the prospective purchaser\r\nbe an American. (2) He is descended from a long line of distinguished\r\ntrotters. To the first of these reiterated and parrot-like claims an\r\nanswer will be found in the chapter relating to that horse, where his\r\ntwenty-one years of stud service have been carefully considered, and\r\nwhere he is shown to have been a monumental failure. In the second claim\r\nthere is some truth and we must consider it very briefly.\r\n\r\nOf all the elements entering into the families of horses locally and\r\nindefinitely called Norfolk Trotters, there were two that might be looked\r\nupon as the founders—Useful Cub and Shales—for they were more conspicuous\r\nand valuable than any others. Mr. John Lawrence was not only a practical\r\nhorseman, but he was the most intelligent and reliable of all the writers\r\non the horse in the latter part of the last century. He was the only one\r\nwho gave any attention to the trotter and trotting affairs. He says: “To\r\nold Shales and Useful Cub the Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk are\r\nindebted for their fame in the production of capital Hackneys.” Useful\r\nCub was bred by Thomas Jenkinson, of Long Sutton in Lincolnshire, and\r\nwas foaled about 1865-70, and was got by a Suffolk cart horse, doubtless\r\na light weight, and his dam was by Golden Farmer, a son of the famous\r\nhalf-bred Sampson, that was the great-grandsire of Messenger and beat\r\nmost of the best horses of his day. Mr. Lawrence knew Useful Cub well,\r\nand was beaten by him in Hyde Park. We have no details of this horse’s\r\nperformances, but it seems to be conceded that he trotted fifteen,\r\nsixteen and seventeen miles in the hour. Old Shales, or Scott’s Shales,\r\nas he is sometimes called, is described by Lawrence as “the bastard son\r\nof Blank,” son of Godolphin Arabian, but Mr. Euren, the compiler of the\r\nHackney Stud Book maintains that he was the son of Blaze and not the\r\nson of Blank. The reasons given for this change I do not remember, but\r\nthey would have to be well founded before I could throw overboard the\r\ncontemporaneous evidence of Mr. Lawrence. It will not do to say that Mr.\r\nLawrence mistook the name Blaze for Blank and so wrote it by mistake,\r\nfor he knew all about both horses. This distinction, however, is of but\r\nlittle practical value. The horses Shales and Useful Cub were both fast\r\nand successful trotters, in their day, and they both became distinguished\r\nsires of trotters. By this I do not mean that they were the sires of\r\nall the trotters, for there were many that were wholly unknown in their\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nJudging from the numbers of leading contests that were reported in\r\nthe _Sporting Magazine_ and other publications, we must conclude that\r\ntrotting contests reached their height as well in numbers as in public\r\ninterest about the last decade in the last century. The contests were all\r\nto saddle, on the road, and the leading ones were made under the watch\r\nand over a long distance of ground, specifying such or such a distance\r\nto be made inside of an hour. To form a correct estimate of the speed of\r\nthose horses, I will copy one paragraph, entire, from the description\r\ngiven by Mr. Lawrence concerning his own mare Betty Bloss:\r\n\r\n    “My own brown mare, known by the name of Betty Bloss, was the\r\n    slowest of all the capital trotters, but at five years old\r\n    trotted fifteen miles in one hour, carrying fourteen stone,\r\n    although fairly mistress of no more than ten. She afterward\r\n    trotted sixteen miles within the hour, with ten stone, with\r\n    much ease to herself and her rider. She was nearly broken down\r\n    at four years old, had bad feet, and, besides, too much blood\r\n    for a trotter, having been got by Sir Hale’s Commoner, out of a\r\n    three-part-bred daughter of Rattle, son of Snip.”\r\n\r\nIn this paragraph, from the best-informed man of his generation, it\r\nwill be noted incidentally that the cry, “no more running blood in\r\nthe trotter,” is not new, but more than a hundred years old. The best\r\nperformances were about sixteen miles in the hour, but there was an\r\noccasional one that reached sixteen and a half. A black gelding called\r\nArcher was recognized as the fastest of that period, and on one occasion\r\nunder a stop watch he trotted the second one of two miles in a little\r\nless than three minutes. From my gleanings I find but a single instance\r\nfrom which we might be able to approximate the money value of trotting\r\nhorses of that day, and this is given as a phenomenal price, viz.,\r\nMarshland Shales, a paternal grandson of the original Shales and out\r\nof a mare by Hue and Cry. He had beaten Reed’s Driver in a match of\r\nseventeen miles for 200 guineas. He was foaled 1802 and in 1812 he\r\nwas sold at auction for 3,051 guineas—$15,255. He was a great horse,\r\nbut this price was just as startling to Englishmen of that day as the\r\n$105,000 was in our own day, when Axtell was sold. This seems to have\r\nbeen the culmination of the “boom” in Norfolk Trotters, and from then\r\ntill the present there has been a steady deterioration in the trotting\r\nstep of the Norfolk horse. In the earlier part of this period of eighty\r\nor ninety years, possibly some exceptions may be found, but they are\r\nonly individual exceptions and do not controvert the broad fact that\r\nmust be apparent to all observers. They had been breeding and training\r\ntheir horses to strike their chins with their knees—the up-and-down\r\nmotion—instead of getting away and covering some ground in their action.\r\nI have stood and watched scores of them in the show-ring, on their native\r\nheath, with their grooms at the ends of long lines running and yelling\r\nlike wild Indians to rouse up their horses, and they called this training\r\nthe trotters. When I privately expressed the wish that saddles might\r\nbe put on a few of the best and the ring cleared so that the trotting\r\naction might be studied, I was very kindly and politely assured that\r\nthey did not show their trotters that way in England. Thus with the\r\ntaut check-rein, the long leading-line and the whoops of the groom they\r\ngot the up-and-down action upon the perfection of which the prizes were\r\nawarded. This explained why the splendid foundation of a breed had been\r\nlost by non-use and why England had produced no trotters in the past\r\nfifty or eighty years.\r\n\r\nWhile our English cousins know they have no trotting horses of their own\r\nthey seem to be exceedingly anxious, possibly for commercial reasons, to\r\nmake it appear that the American trotting horse is the lineal descendant\r\nof the Norfolk Trotter. This effort is not restricted to the idle\r\ntwaddle about Bellfounder, which everybody on this side of the Atlantic\r\nestimates at its true value, but it has taken an official and wider\r\nrange, which, trifling though it be, my duty as a historian impels me\r\nto expose. Mr. Henry P. Euren, the compiler of the Hackney Stud Book,\r\nwrote to the Commissioner of Agriculture, at Washington, D. C., in 1888,\r\ntaking exceptions to some conclusions reached in an article written by\r\nMr. Leslie E. Macleod, in my office, on “The National Horse of America,”\r\nand published in the report of the Department of Agriculture for 1887;\r\nMr. Euren claiming that the American trotting horse came originally from\r\nNorfolk, in England. In proof of this he says: “I beg to inclose you\r\na cutting which confirms my idea.” And now for the “cutting” which he\r\noffers as proof:\r\n\r\n    “It appears from an Act of Parliament, passed December 6, 1748,\r\n    in the Legislature of the State of New Jersey, America, that on\r\n    and after the publication of this Act, all Norfolk pacing or\r\n    trotting of horses for lucre or gain, or for any sum or sums\r\n    of money at any time (excepting such times as are hereafter\r\n    expressly provided for by this Act), shall be and are hereby\r\n    declared public nuisances, provided always that at all fairs\r\n    that are or may be held within this province, and that on the\r\n    first working day after the three great festivals of Christmas,\r\n    Easter and Whitsuntide, etc., etc.”\r\n\r\nThe act passed by the provincial legislature of the colony of New Jersey\r\nin 1748 embraced very stringent regulations against dice, lotteries,\r\netc., as well as horse racing. It is divided into several sections, and\r\nat Section 4 we reach the provision against racing as follows:\r\n\r\n    “And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that\r\n    after the publication of this Act, all horse racing, pacing or\r\n    trotting of horses for lucre or gain, or for any sum or sums\r\n    of money at any time (excepting such times as are hereafter\r\n    expressly provided for and allowed by this Act), shall be and\r\n    are hereby declared public nuisances, and shall be prosecuted\r\n    as public nuisances, in manner hereinbefore directed. Provided\r\n    always, and it is the true intent and meaning of this Act, that\r\n    at all fairs that are or may be held within this province, and\r\n    that on the first working day after the three grand festivals\r\n    of Christmas, Easter and Whitsuntide, etc., etc.”\r\n\r\nThese quotations are sufficiently extended to afford an unmistakable\r\ncomparison, and on their face evidence that cannot be doubted for one\r\nmoment that they both purport to be copied from the same act of the\r\nJersey Colonial legislature. In the official printed copy which is\r\nbefore me as I write, the mandate is against “all horse racing, pacing\r\nor trotting of horses for lucre or gain.” In Mr. Euren’s “cutting” the\r\nmandate is against “all Norfolk pacing or trotting of horses for lucre\r\nor gain,” etc. The substitution of the word “Norfolk” instead of “horse\r\nracing,” is in the nature of a forgery, and I cannot believe that Mr.\r\nEuren would be guilty of any such execrable piece of trickery. It must\r\nhave been conceived and written by some horse sharp who was trying to\r\nsell a Hackney to an American with a pocket full of money, and after he\r\nhad effected his sale he could mutter quietly, when at a safe distance\r\nfrom his victim, the couplet from “Hudibras:”\r\n\r\n    “The paltry story is untrue\r\n    And forged to cheat such gulls as you.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, for Mr. Euren, he indorsed the trick, and not\r\nonly indorsed it, but sent it to the Commissioner of Agriculture with the\r\nhope and possible expectation that it would receive public recognition\r\nand become part of the horse history of this country. Did he not know\r\nthat somebody would be nosing round among the old laws and expose the\r\ndirty deception? But, on the basis that Mr. Euren was deceived by this\r\nwretched interpolation of a fraud into the law, could he not see that the\r\ndate of the law—1748—was before old Shales or Useful Cub was foaled, and\r\nlong before the very first “Norfolk trotter” was ever heard of either in\r\nNorfolk or in any other part of England?\r\n\r\nThe exposure of this foolish attempt, wherever it originated, to\r\nincorporate into an old New Jersey statute a fiction, or a forgery, as\r\nit may be called, carries with it a punishment that should be felt by\r\nthe most unscrupulous of horse sharps; but when we find it unequivocally\r\nindorsed and given to the world as true by the compiler of the Hackney\r\nStud Book, it destroys all confidence in the accuracy and reliability\r\nof that work. This is a misfortune that the friends of the Hackney in\r\nEngland as well as in this country must feel as a blow at the value of\r\nthe whole interest. Opinions may change with new light, and opposing\r\nconclusions may be honestly reached from different standpoints, but\r\nrunning against a fixed and certain date, as in this case, is like\r\nrunning against a two-edged sword.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Hackney is merely the dear-bought and far-fetched\r\nfashion of the hour. A few years ago he was “something new in horses,”\r\njust as the modiste has “something new in dresses.” He was found in\r\nEngland, where there are no flies, without a tail, and as that was\r\nthe fashion in England we must have horses in America without tails,\r\nnotwithstanding the millions of torments they have to endure without\r\nthe natural means of defense. As hack-a-bouts they are good horses, but\r\ntheir “churn-dasher” style of action will never become acceptable to the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nA few years since a quite persistent attempt, backed by unlimited\r\nwealth and all the prestige that metropolitan “fashion” and “society”\r\ncould bestow, was made, particularly in New York, to create a Hackney\r\n“boom” in America. All that element in the social life of our great\r\ncities that affects a disdain for things distinctively American, and\r\nparticularly for American horses, and that glories in the stultifying\r\nhabit of aping things “English, ye know,” took up the Hackney fad with\r\nunbounded enthusiasm. As a park and road horse the American horse—the\r\nincomparable trotting-bred driver—was to be incontinently crowded out\r\nof the driveways, the markets and the shows. The National Horse Show\r\nAssociation, whose annual show at Madison Square Garden is the great\r\nsocial _fête_ of the year in New York, lent all its powerful influence\r\nto forward the Hackney “boom,” which was, it must in fairness be said,\r\nconsistent; for the miscalled National Horse Show has always catered more\r\nto foreign horses and foreign customs in horsemanship than to American\r\nhorses and horsemen. Men of great wealth and prominence established\r\nextensive Hackney studs, imported famous prize-winning stallions and\r\nmares, and there was only one thing left to be done, and that was to\r\nconvert the American people to the belief that the driving horse they had\r\nbeen breeding and developing with a special purpose and care—the fleetest\r\nand most versatile harness horse in the world—was inferior to an imported\r\nnondescript. In that attempt the Hackney advocates have failed in America\r\nas completely as did Mr. Blunt and others in England, when they sought to\r\nmake racing men believe that the Arab was a better race horse than the\r\nEnglish thoroughbred.\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing illustrates better what I have called the versatility\r\nof the trotter than this contest with the Hackney in the latter’s own\r\nespecial field—if he may be said to have any. Of course there could be\r\nno contest between the horse of a special breed and the nondescript as a\r\nharness horse for speed or usefulness on the road, whether the distance\r\nwere half a mile or a hundred miles; but in the show-ring the Hackney\r\nmen claimed absolute pre-eminence for their “high-acting” horses. They\r\ndid not dare contest with the trotter in the matter of road speed, so\r\nto have any contest at all the trotting horse men had to “carry the war\r\ninto Africa.” This they have done with a vengeance. They have taken the\r\npure-bred trotting horse, dressed him in the fashion dictated by the\r\nHackney “faddists,” taught him the Hackney tricks, the preposterous\r\nHackney action and all that, and have beaten the Hackneys not once but\r\ntime and again right on their own ground, viz., at the National Horse\r\nShow in Madison Square Garden. In almost all cases in classes where\r\ntrotters have been admitted to compete with Hackneys, the former have\r\ncarried off the honors within the past two years. Many notable instances\r\nmight be cited, but one will suffice. At the National Horse Show, 1896, a\r\nclass was offered for “half-bred Hackneys,” sires to be shown with four\r\nof their get. The Hackney end of the argument was upheld by Mr. A. J.\r\nCassatt’s renowned prize-winner, imported Cadet, with four of his get.\r\nAgainst him was entered the well-known trotting sire Almont Jr., 2:26,\r\nwith four of his get, and though the judges were gentlemen identified\r\nmore or less with the Hackney interest, so superior in form, action and\r\nstyle were the four youngsters by the trotting sire that they carried\r\naway the honors from the chosen progeny of one of the most noted Hackney\r\nshow horses in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the sale ring this verdict has been corroborated. The highest\r\nprices—the record figures—paid in the fashionable New York market for\r\npark horses, “high steppers,” or by whatever name the merely spectacular\r\nharness horse may from time to time be called, have been paid for\r\ntrotting-bred horses: and in advertised sales of “Hackneys” it has become\r\nsomewhat common to encounter half-trotting-bred and full-trotting-bred\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nWhile no genuine American and horseman can without regret see a typical\r\nAmerican horse mutilated and his action perverted in the manner required\r\nto bring him into “Hackney” classes at the National Horse Show, or in\r\nthe markets where New York society people buy their stub-tailed horses,\r\nit is some compensation to know that these experiments have demonstrated\r\nthe superiority of the American-bred horse even in the field claimed as\r\nespecially that of the Hackney. And the Hackney “fad” in America, while\r\nit lasted, accomplished a good end in so far as it directed the attention\r\nof American breeders more to the importance of form and style, and taught\r\nthem that in their own trotting families they have the material from\r\nwhich may best be produced, in form and style and quality as well as in\r\nspeed, pre-eminently the most excellent park horses in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATION OF DISPUTED PEDIGREES.\r\n\r\n    Tendency to misrepresentation—The Bald Galloway and\r\n    Darley Arabian— Godolphin Arabian—Early experiences with\r\n    trotting pedigrees—Mr. Backman’s honest methods—Shanghai\r\n    Mary—Capt. Rynders and Widow Machree—Woodburn Farm and\r\n    its pedigree methods—Victimized by “horse sharps” and\r\n    pedigree makers—Alleged pedigree of Pilot Jr. conclusively\r\n    overthrown—Pedigrees of Edwin Forrest, Norman, Bay Chief and\r\n    Black Rose—Maud S.’s pedigree exhaustively considered—Captain\r\n    John W. Russell never owned the mare Maria Russell—The deadly\r\n    parallel columns settle it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few years more than forty have slipped away since I first began to\r\ngive serious attention to the subject of horse history and to contribute\r\nan occasional article to the press on that subject. Among my very\r\nearliest observations, or I might say, experiences, was the realization\r\nof the fact that exaggeration as a habit of thought and utterance was\r\npractically universal among horsemen. Sometimes I have thought this\r\ntendency to the untrue resulted from the ammoniacal exhalations of the\r\nstable, but this thought is not a satisfactory solution, for some of the\r\ngreatest liars about horses have never known anything about stables.\r\nThen, again, I have thought that a really skillful metaphysician might\r\nwrite a learned disquisition of the question and satisfy himself as\r\nto the cause of this moral delinquency, but nobody would be able to\r\nunderstand him when he had completed it. This wretched vice, so prevalent\r\neverywhere, was not restricted to the professional country “hoss jockey,”\r\nready to “swap” with every man he met on the road, but it reached up\r\nto men of otherwise excellent character, and these men would “stretch\r\nthe blanket” tremendously about the blood and other qualities of the\r\nhorses they were selling. The only way we can account for an otherwise\r\nhonest and truthful man exaggerating the merits and blood of his horses\r\nmust be (1) in the fact that he has become attached to him and thinks\r\nhim better than he is, or it may be (2) that he bought with a false\r\npedigree and without examining it, he assumes it is true and represents\r\nit accordingly. But underlying all this, the representation cannot be\r\ndisproved, and (3) it may add to the market value of the horse.\r\n\r\nThis weakness of human nature, so pervasive of all interests connected\r\nwith the horse, did not originate in this country, but came from the\r\nold world. We inherit it from our ancestors. “The fathers have eaten\r\na sour grape and the children’s teeth are set on edge.” Take the case\r\nof the little bald-faced, pacing-bred horse known in the old records\r\nas “The Bald Galloway” and while it is not probable he had a single\r\ndrop of Saracenic blood in his veins, he is fitted out with a grand\r\npedigree, full of that blood. Although I have already referred to this\r\nhorse as an exemplification of the dishonesty of the early records of\r\nEnglish pedigrees, I will again look at it in a more specific manner.\r\nHe was nothing more nor less than a little native horse, belonging to a\r\ntribe of noted pacers in the southwestern part of Scotland and in the\r\nnorthern part of England. These Galloways were probably the very last\r\nremnant of pacers to be found in Great Britain. He is represented in\r\nthe books to have been by a horse called “St. Victor’s Barb;” dam by\r\nWhynot; grandam a Royal Mare. The Bald Galloway was foaled not later than\r\n1708, and it was probably a few years earlier. His reputed sire, “St.\r\nVictor’s Barb,” is not to be found anywhere and was probably fictitious.\r\nHis dam was represented to be by Whynot, and this horse was not foaled\r\ntill 1744—thirty-six years _after_ his grandson was foaled. The grandam\r\nis given as a “Royal Mare,” which in that day was a convenient way of\r\nrounding out a pedigree, just as we now attempt to round them out when\r\nwe know nothing of the blood by saying “dam thoroughbred.” “The Bald\r\nGalloway” was one of the most successful stallions of his day, and yet\r\nhe was nothing in the world but a good representative of the old pacing\r\nGalloways of that portion of Scotland then called Galloway. He was low\r\nin stature, but he was esteemed as one of the greatest and most valuable\r\nracing sires of his generation. One of his sons—the Carlisle Gelding—was\r\nstill a race horse when he was eighteen years old.\r\n\r\n“The Darley Arabian” was contemporaneous with the Bald Galloway, and\r\nthey commenced service in England about the same year. It is said he was\r\nbrought from Aleppo, in Syria, or, perhaps I had better say Asia Minor.\r\nAleppo is but a short distance from the borders of ancient Cappadocia and\r\nCilicia, countries that were famous in history for the great numbers\r\nof fine horses that they produced far more than a thousand years before\r\nthe first horse was taken to Arabia. This horse is called an “Arabian,”\r\nand in the brief record of his importation we have the same venerable\r\n“chestnut” served up to us that has served so many generations of\r\nspeculators in “Arabian blood.” The record says that Mr. Darley had a\r\nbrother who was an agent for merchandise abroad, who “became a member\r\nof a hunting club, by which means he acquired interest to procure this\r\nhorse.” This “gag” has been played too often to give _éclat_ to horses\r\nclaimed to be brought from Arabia, in the past two hundred years, to\r\nhave much effect on the minds of people who have any sense. That it\r\nrequired great social or political influence to induce the old Arab\r\nsheik to part with him, was intended merely to secure the attention of\r\nprospective customers to his superlative excellence in order to obtain\r\ntheir patronage. This horse probably never was within five hundred miles\r\nof the nearest part of Arabia, and to call him an Arabian is a misnomer\r\nwholly unjustifiable. He came from a country where horses were abundant\r\nand cheap on all sides, and of a quality far superior to any Arabian. He\r\nwas simply a Turk, he was for sale, and it required no influence to buy\r\nhim except the contents of the purchaser’s purse. This horse has always\r\nbeen classed as one of the two great founders of the English race horse.\r\nHis progeny from well-bred mares were not numerous, and his greatest\r\ndistinction is in the fact that he was the sire of Flying Childers. In\r\naccordance with the truth, he should be known in the records as “Darley’s\r\nTurk.”\r\n\r\nThe horse bearing the dishonest misnomer of “Godolphin Arabian” was\r\nreally the greatest regenerator and upbuilder of the running horse that\r\nEngland ever possessed. There seems to be no historical doubt that he\r\nwas brought from France, and that is all we know about his origin and\r\nearly history. It may be laid down, therefore, as a safe proposition,\r\nthat the odds are as a thousand to one that he was a French horse. The\r\nonly evidence that can ever be furnished as to the strain of blood that\r\nhe may have possessed must be found and studied in his portrait, which\r\nappears in this volume. I believe this portrait to be a correct and\r\ntrue delineation of the horse, and there is not a single lineament in\r\nor about it that indicates the blood of either the Arabian or the Barb.\r\nHis pedigree is in his picture, and, from what is known in history and\r\nfrom what has been preserved in art, instead of “Godolphin Arabian” his\r\ntrue title should be “Godolphin Frenchman.” But this subject has been\r\ndiscussed at greater length in the chapter on the English Race Horse, to\r\nwhich my reader is here referred.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on the American Race Horse, I think sufficient attention\r\nhas been given to the frauds and impossibilities that are to be found\r\neverywhere in the extended pedigrees of our own running horses to satisfy\r\nany one that the remote extensions of pedigrees are a great mass of\r\ndishonest rubbish, with scarcely a speck of truth to be found. I will,\r\ntherefore, pass along to the consideration of some of the difficulties,\r\nof the same nature, that have been developed in investigating and\r\nrecording the pedigrees of the American Trotting Horse. In entering the\r\nuntrodden wilderness of trotting-horse history it became the ambition\r\nof my life to reach the truth in every possible instance and to cut\r\noff and reject all frauds wherever they showed their heads. This meant\r\nwar from the beginning with a great many horsemen, but it also meant\r\nthe enthusiastic support of a great many honest men. The trouble, at\r\nthis point, was in the fact that a number of prominent, wealthy and\r\ninfluential breeders insisted upon their right to state their pedigrees\r\nin their own way and thus compel me to indorse them by inserting them in\r\nthe Trotting Register. When at work on the early volumes of the Register,\r\nespecially the first, if a man of unblemished reputation and intelligence\r\nsent me a list of his stock to be registered, I assumed that he had too\r\nmuch regard for his reputation and standing as a breeder to print a lot\r\nof pedigrees in his catalogue that he did not _know_ to be correct, and\r\nhence I accepted many a pedigree that was based upon fiction. In course\r\nof time it began to dawn upon my understanding that there were many\r\nmen in the world of unsullied reputation, as they were known in their\r\nbusiness relations, who would stand up boldly for a fiction or a fraud in\r\nthe pedigrees of their stock. It is but just to say that all the men who\r\nuttered fraudulent pedigrees were not equally guilty, for in some cases\r\nthe owners had been victimized by unscrupulous rogues from whom they\r\nhad purchased, and in others they had been betrayed by the still more\r\nunscrupulous rogues whom they had employed to make up their catalogues on\r\nthe supposition that they were capable and honest. This state of things\r\nsoon developed another line of thought and observation in my mind which\r\nevolved a rule by which I could determine the difference between the\r\ndegrees of honesty among horsemen. One man, when a fiction in a pedigree\r\nwas pointed out, would go to work and carefully investigate it; while\r\nanother would hang and higgle about it and finally investigate, not to\r\nfind the truth, but to find how many old rummies, swipes and negroes he\r\ncould get together, who would support his claim and swear to it for a\r\nhalf-dollar each. The first man investigates to find the truth wherever\r\nit may lead; while the second man investigates merely, not to find the\r\ntruth, but to find some kind of evidence to sustain the untruth. In the\r\neveryday affairs of life these two men may stand on the same plane, but,\r\nat heart, the one is honest and the other a rogue.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Charles Backman founded the great Stonyford breeding farm in\r\nOrange County, New York, he was an excellent horseman, in a general\r\nsense, although he did not pretend to know much about pedigrees. About\r\n1869 he placed all his pedigrees in my hands with the request that I\r\nwould give them a careful examination, strike out everything that was\r\nwrong and note everything that was doubtful or uncertain, that it might\r\nbe investigated and the truth fully determined, no difference where it\r\nmight lead. Many investigations followed which were conducted by his\r\nsecretary, Mr. Shipman, either by mail or by personal visitation—so\r\nmany, indeed, that Mr. Shipman became quite an expert in this kind of\r\ndifficult work. As an illustration of the methods pursued, one instance\r\nwill serve to show how it was done, and more than this, it is a very\r\ninteresting history in itself. In the first volume of the Register I had\r\nentered Green Mountain Maid, the dam of the famous Electioneer and all\r\nthat family, as “by Harry Clay, dam said to be by Lexington.” This was\r\nthe form in which Mr. Backman had received the pedigree, except that it\r\nwas stated positively and without any “said to be” that the dam was by\r\nLexington, the great running horse. After a time I called Mr. Backman’s\r\nattention to this “said to be” and suggested that if the mare was really\r\na daughter of Lexington she could certainly be traced and established.\r\nThe next day, Mr. Shipman started to Western New York and to Ohio. On\r\nhis trip he found the mare had been known in Western New York as the\r\n“Angelica Mare” and afterward as “Shanghai Mary,” that she was a trotter,\r\nwell known locally, and that she had trotted a race and won at a State\r\nfair, in very fast time for that day. She had been brought from Ohio by\r\nsome sheep-dealers, who were able to give her exact age, and it was thus\r\nfound that she was older than her reputed sire. Several expert horsemen,\r\nfrom a picture secured by Mr. Shipman on his trip, have not hesitated to\r\ngive it as a strong conviction that she belonged to the Cadmus family,\r\nin Southern Ohio. In the last two or three years a correspondent of the\r\nChicago _Horse Review_ brings out some local facts that make it almost\r\nmorally certain that she was bred by Goldsmith Coffein, of Red Lion,\r\nOhio, and that she was got by Iron’s Cadmus, the sire of the great\r\nPocahontas. The final nail has not been clinched in establishing this\r\npedigree, and probably never will be, but the circumstances are so fully\r\ndetailed as to scarcely leave room for a doubt that she was a half-sister\r\nto the famous Pocahontas.\r\n\r\nFrom what has here been said about the methods of Mr. Backman, the\r\nleading breeder of that period, in the North, it should not be inferred\r\nthat all Northern breeders were like him. The first real battle I ever\r\nhad against fraudulent pedigrees originated in Orange County, New York,\r\nwith the notorious Captain Rynders, in which the pedigree of the once\r\nfamous Widow Machree, the dam of Aberdeen, was involved. The pedigree of\r\nthis mare had been registered as obtained from Mr. James W. Hoyt, who\r\nonce owned her, and her dam was given as by Durland’s Messenger Duroc.\r\nWhen Aberdeen came before the public for patronage, his owner, Rynders,\r\nadvertised him as out of Widow Machree and she out of a mare by Abdallah.\r\nThis was challenged as untrue by Mr. Guy Miller and Mr. Joseph Gavin, of\r\nOrange County, and I was called upon to demand the evidence upon which\r\nthe change had been made from Messenger Duroc to Abdallah. As a matter\r\nof course “the fat was in the fire” at once, and out came Rynders with\r\na terrific explosion of anger, abounding in threats and denunciations\r\nagainst anybody and everybody who attempted to interfere with his\r\n“business.” The good names of Guy Miller and Joseph Gavin carried too\r\nmuch weight as against that of Isaiah Rynders, and, as his last card, he\r\nbrought out a duly and formally executed affidavit, sworn to by a man\r\nwhose name I will not here mention, stating that he bred the Abdallah\r\nmare; all of which was the very rankest perjury, which was so easily\r\nexposed that it did Rynders far more harm than good. At last the whole\r\ntruth came out in a form that was complete and conclusive, showing that\r\nthe mare in question was bred by Garrett Duryea, of Bethel, Sullivan\r\nCounty, New York, and was got by a horse known as Pintler’s Bolivar.\r\nRynders had been a leader in New York politics so long that he knew just\r\nhow to manage things where the truth must be suppressed. He was a liberal\r\nadvertiser, the two sporting papers were needy for patronage in that\r\nline, and their columns were closed to any and all communications against\r\nhis side of the question. But all this failed to suppress the truth and\r\nuphold a fraud, and I doubt whether there is a man living to-day who does\r\nnot believe that the fight was fairly and honestly won. This contest\r\ntaught me a very important lesson, and that was, that if I expected\r\nto fight bogus pedigrees I must have a channel of communication of my\r\nown. Hence _Wallace’s Monthly_, which, in its day, was not only able to\r\nexpose bogus pedigrees, but lead intelligent thought and experience on\r\nall breeding subjects, till it fell into the hands of an unscrupulous\r\nneocracy, where it soon died for want of brains.\r\n\r\nHaving given a very brief illustration of the methods which governed Mr.\r\nBackman in ascertaining and determining the blood elements which entered\r\ninto the foundation of his great breeding establishment, and the care and\r\npromptness with which errors were eliminated, it is now in order to take\r\na glance at the methods pursued at the great Woodburn Farm, founded by\r\nR. A. Alexander in Kentucky. These were the two earliest establishments,\r\nof any prominence, for breeding the trotter, in the whole country. The\r\none was the northern center of the interest and the other the southern,\r\nand they together may be considered as representative of both sections.\r\nMr. Alexander, I think, was reared and educated in Scotland, and there\r\ninherited a large estate. Upon coming into this inheritance he determined\r\nto transfer his interests to Kentucky, where he bought up a cluster\r\nof farms and shaped them for the purpose of building up a mammoth\r\nestablishment for the breeding of all varieties of domestic animals of\r\nthe highest type and excellence. I think his fancy ran more to Short Horn\r\ncattle than to any other line of breeding, probably because he knew more\r\nabout the value and merit of the different tribes of that breed than he\r\ndid of any other variety. The founding of an establishment so immense,\r\nand for the grand purpose of the breeding and improving the varieties\r\nof domestic animals, was the agricultural sensation of the period, and\r\neverybody, from one end of the land to the other, soon knew of and\r\napplauded the great enterprise. There had been great enterprises on\r\nsimilar lines before, and there have been even greater ones since, but\r\nMr. Alexander’s Woodburn Farm, of Kentucky, may always be looked upon as\r\nthe real pioneer in stock breeding on a large and methodical scale, and\r\nwithout limit as to resources. A university education in Scotland, with\r\nall its training in the refinements of logical distinctions, did not\r\nbring to Mr. Alexander a knowledge of the pedigrees of Kentucky horses,\r\nnor did it train him in the detection of the tricks of Kentucky horse\r\ndealers, and thus as a purchaser of his breeding stock he was looked upon\r\nby the “sharps” as a fat goose, ready to be plucked. After these “sharps”\r\nhad secured their pluckings, Mr. Alexander called in a professional\r\npedigreeist to put the lines of the blood he had purchased in order and\r\nprint a catalogue. This “professional” was not a pedigree _tracer_,\r\nfor he never traced anything in his life, but a pedigree _maker_, and\r\nwherever he thought that anything was needed he added it, whether true or\r\nnot, and it went to the world in that form. This is more conspicuously\r\ntrue in the department of trotting pedigrees, as will appear below.\r\nThus the acts of an incapable and dishonest employee were given the\r\nindorsement of an honorable and eminent name; falsehoods were made to\r\nappear as truths; counterfeits were put in circulation that are still\r\ncirculating as genuine coin, with many people. Under the circumstances,\r\nMr. Alexander could hardly be blamed, for, knowing nothing of such\r\nmatters of his own knowledge, he employed what he supposed was the best\r\nauthority then to be found. For my own part, when I came to register the\r\nWoodburn stock, I was ready to accept as true whatever I found in the\r\ncatalogue, believing that Mr. Alexander was incapable of publishing to\r\nthe world a misrepresentation. In this estimate of his character I was\r\nright, and I have never changed my opinion on that point, but when I came\r\nto examine the structure of his catalogue I found there was rotten wood\r\nall through it. A few examples that have been carefully investigated will\r\nserve to show the value of the work done by the “pedigree maker” for Mr.\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\nPilot Jr. was a gray horse, foaled 1844, was got by Old Pacing Pilot and\r\nattained the distinction of being the head of a well-known family of\r\ntrotters. He was foaled 1844, bred by Angereau Gray, and owned a number\r\nof years by Glasgow & Heinsohn, of Louisville, Kentucky. He was kept\r\na number of years about Lexington, Kentucky, by Dr. Herr, Mr. Bradley,\r\nand perhaps others, and always advertised as “by Pilot (the pacer), dam\r\nNancy Pope, grandam Nancy Taylor.” Nobody then ever pretended to know\r\nwhat horse was the sire of either Nancy Pope or Nancy Taylor. He was\r\nthen owned by the parties who afterward sold him to Mr. Alexander, and\r\nit is evident they did not then know anything about the sires of these\r\nmares. Mr. Alexander bought him in 1858, and immediately his “pedigree\r\nmaker” furnished the sires of these two mares; Nancy Pope was given as\r\nby Havoc, son of Sir Charles, and Nancy Taylor as by imported Alfred.\r\nThe controversy about this pedigree was long and sharp, the one side,\r\nheaded by the modern management at Woodburn, as usual laboring to sustain\r\nthe infallibility of the Woodburn catalogues, and the other to reach the\r\nexact truth, whatever it might be. The Board of Censors of the National\r\nBreeders’ Association sent out a call for information on certain abstract\r\npoints and finally reached a decision as follows: (1) That Havoc, the\r\nreputed sire of Nancy Pope, the dam of Pilot Jr., died in 1828. (2) That\r\nNancy Pope was not foaled till 1832. (3) That the breeding of Nancy\r\nTaylor, the dam of Nancy Pope, was unknown. These dates were fixed by\r\nundoubted evidence, and, as afterward developed, another might have\r\nbeen added with equal authenticity. Imported Alfred, the reputed sire\r\nof Nancy Taylor, was not imported till several years after Nancy Taylor\r\nwas foaled, and thus it was clearly shown by the absolutely insuperable\r\ndifficulties of dates that both the sires inserted in the pedigree were\r\nnothing more than very stupid fictions.\r\n\r\nEdwin Forrest seems to have held second place in the list of stallions\r\nin the Woodburn Stud at that period, and the remote extensions of his\r\npedigree were also fictitious. His grandam was represented to be by\r\nDuroc, the famous son of imported Diomed, and his great-grandam by\r\nimported Messenger. The first two crosses were technically inaccurately\r\nstated, but the second two, as given here, were purely fictitious.\r\n\r\nNorman, the third stallion in the catalogue, had his sire correctly given\r\nas the Morse Horse, but his dam was given as by Jersey Highlander and\r\nhis grandam as by Bishop’s Hambletonian, son of Messenger, both of which\r\nwere wholly fictitious. His dam was by a horse called Magnum Bonum, a\r\nrepresentative of a family of that name, and that is all that is known\r\nof his pedigree. A full showing of this pedigree will be found in the\r\n“Trotting Register,” Vol. III.\r\n\r\nBay Chief was a bay son of Mambrino Chief, with a bald face, and was\r\noften called Bald Chief. He was the sensational trotter of the whole\r\nMambrino Chief family, and I believe it is true that when four years old\r\nhe showed a half-mile on Mr. Alexander’s track in 1:08 and repeated in\r\n1:08½. In the catalogue he is given as foaled in 1859, got by Mambrino\r\nChief, dam by Keokuk, son of imported Truffle; grandam a thoroughbred\r\nmare by Stamboul Arabian. As this was found in Mr. Alexander’s catalogue\r\nI took it for granted it must be true, but I never had heard of a\r\nrunning horse called Keokuk before, and I kept hunting for ever so many\r\nyears without finding hide nor hair of him, until 1885, when the whole\r\nmystery was developed. Mr. Richard Johnson, of Scott County, Kentucky,\r\nhad business interests in Keokuk, Iowa, in the early fifties, probably\r\nlocating land warrants, and he bought a pair of mares in Keokuk to travel\r\nover the prairies, and when he was through with his work he brought the\r\nteam home with him to Scott County. He knew nothing whatever of the\r\nbreeding of those mares, but they were a good pair of drivers and one of\r\nthem was quite a smart roadster that he called “Old Keokuk.” He bred this\r\nmare, Keokuk, in 1858 to Mambrino Chief, and in 1859 she produced the\r\ncolt called Bay Chief. In 1862 he was bred to some sixteen or eighteen\r\nmares, and the fall of that year Mr. Alexander bought the colt at public\r\nauction, paying one thousand dollars for him. He was taken to Woodburn,\r\nput in training and never covered any more mares. In the spring of\r\n1865 he was killed in a raid of Southern troops upon the horse stock\r\nat Woodburn. (For further particulars of this little sketch the reader\r\nis referred to _Wallace’s Monthly_ for 1885, page 285.) To fix up a\r\npedigree for the maternal side of this colt was no easy matter, but Mr.\r\nAlexander’s “pedigree maker” proved himself fully equal to the occasion.\r\nThere was the nasty name Keokuk fastened to the old mare, and it would\r\nstick as tight as wax to the end of her days, coming from a region where\r\nthere was no drop of running blood; so he made a “thoroughbred” horse,\r\nright on the spot, and gave him the name of Keokuk, which would account\r\nfor the name of the mare, and pronounced him a son of imported Truffle.\r\nTo supply a “thoroughbred” grandam was comparatively easy, for Mr.\r\nJohnson had long been a resident of Scott County, and the horse Stamboul\r\nhad been kept in that county, hence there could be no doubt that she\r\nwas a “thoroughbred” daughter of that horse. With this review of the\r\nmisfortunes of Mr. Alexander in placing the arrangement and, I might say,\r\ncare of his pedigrees, in dishonest hands, we will pass whatever may\r\nremain of his early stallions, and take a glance at some of the pedigrees\r\nof his brood mares.\r\n\r\nBlack Rose proved to be one of the best brood mares ever owned at\r\nWoodburn. I am told she was a pacer, and certainly all that is known of\r\nher blood was pacing blood. She was sought after and procured by Mr.\r\nAlexander because she had produced several trotters, and it can be read\r\nall through his purchases for the trotting stud, that he had undoubting\r\nconfidence in the theory that trotters must come from trotters. When this\r\nmare first appeared in the Woodburn catalogue no dam was given to her,\r\nbut meantime the “pedigree maker” had come around, and the next year she\r\nwas fitted out with the following, in fine style.\r\n\r\n    “Black Rose, bl. m., foaled about 1847; got by Tom Teemer; dam\r\n    by Cannon’s Whip; g. d. by Robin Gray, son of imp. Royalist.”\r\n\r\nThe pedigree stood in this form a number of years, and probably would\r\nstill be so standing had it not been that in trying to learn something\r\nmore about the sire, Tom Teemer, I received some intimations that made\r\nme doubtful about the maternal side. On a certain occasion I asked Mr.\r\nR. S. Veech, of Kentucky, what he knew about it, and he replied that\r\nhe had made a trip to Clark County for no other purpose than to trace\r\nand investigate the pedigree of Black Rose, and he was not able to get\r\na single syllable of information about her dam, any more than if she\r\nnever had a dam. Some time afterward I wrote to Mr. Brodhead, manager\r\nat Woodburn, inquiring where the pedigree of Black Rose as given and\r\nperpetuated in the Woodburn catalogues came from and on what basis it\r\nrested. He replied promptly and briefly that Mr. Veech had made a trip\r\nto Clark County in search of this pedigree and the result of that search\r\nwas what appeared in the catalogue. These are the facts, substantially,\r\nas given me by these two gentlemen, and this is the first time I have\r\never given them to the public. I have known Mr. Veech intimately and\r\ntrustingly for twenty-eight years and I know him to be eminently\r\ntruthful. I have not known Mr. Brodhead so long, and if he had not\r\npublished the fraudulent extension of this pedigree in his catalogues\r\nevery year for more than ten years, before Mr. Veech made his trip to\r\nClark County, I might at least express my sympathy with him in having so\r\nbad a memory. Mr. Brodhead had nothing to do with either the original\r\nconstruction or utterance of this fraud, for he was not then connected\r\nwith the management of Woodburn. My readers can employ their own terms\r\nin characterizing, as it deserves, the fraudulent act of manufacturing a\r\npedigree out of whole cloth; and they can also exercise their own ethical\r\ndiscrimination in determining whether the man who executes the fraud is\r\nany worse than the man who maintains and supports it after he knows it is\r\nfraudulent.\r\n\r\nWe pass on to Sally Russell, the grandam of Maud S. It is not a pleasant\r\ntask to review an old controversy, whatever it might bring to light;\r\nbut a controversy which involves the true lines of descent of so great\r\na family as that of Maud S., Nutwood, Lord Russell, etc., is worth\r\npreserving for the enlightenment of future generations. It all turns\r\nupon the breeding of Sally Russell and the identity of her breeder. She\r\nwas a little chestnut mare, represented to have been foaled 1850, got\r\nby Boston and out of Maria Russell, by Rattler, and so on, claimed to\r\nbe thoroughbred. She was bought by Mr. Alexander from the foreman on\r\nCaptain John W. Russell’s farm, with the pedigree given as above. The\r\nname of her breeder was not given to Mr. Alexander, I think, but Bruce\r\nhas it that her dam, Maria Russell, and this mare Sally Russell were both\r\nbred by Benjamin Luckett. In 1863 this mare was offered, with others, to\r\nthe highest bidder, at Mr. Alexander’s annual sale, being then thirteen\r\nyears, old according to the records of the establishment, and the\r\nauctioneer was not able to coax a bid of ten dollars on her and she was\r\nled out unsold. Five years later—1868—I attended the Woodburn sale, and\r\na little scrubby-looking old mare was brought into the ring, represented\r\nto have been stinted to imported Australian, and when this was announced\r\na subdued whisper went round the ring, “She’ll never raise another foal.”\r\nThe auctioneer was eloquent upon the value of the Australian blood on\r\nthe Boston blood, and the possibilities of the coming foal, but all to\r\nno purpose, as the mare was led out of the ring the second time, with\r\nno person willing to bid a dollar. I was astonished that such an animal\r\nshould have been put up at auction, for she had all the appearance of\r\nbeing twenty-eight instead of eighteen. She died that summer, apparently\r\nof old age, and I have no shadow of doubt that she sank under the weight\r\nof years. On two separate occasions great crowds of practical horsemen\r\nhad, in this manner, proclaimed that Mr. Alexander had been victimized in\r\nthe age of the mare, and fifteen years later I determined to settle the\r\nquestion as to whether this judgment was right.\r\n\r\nAs the supposed age and breeding of Sally Russell has been made to turn\r\nand rest upon the ownership of her dam, Maria Russell, it is important\r\nthat we should have the antecedent circumstances set out in the plainest\r\npossible manner. Captain John A. Holton and Captain John W. Russell\r\nwere farmers in Kentucky, living a few miles apart, and I think they\r\nwere both river men at one time or another; certainly Russell was in\r\ncommand of a snag boat on the Ohio and Mississippi along about 1836-40.\r\nLike many other Kentucky farmers, they both bred a few running horses,\r\nbut not enough, singly, to justify the expense of separate training\r\nestablishments, so they united their strings in one stable, sharing the\r\nexpense and dividing the profits, if any, equally. The partnership did\r\nnot extend to the joint ownership of any of the horses, but simply to the\r\nlosses or profits of training and racing, and Major Benjamin Luckett was\r\nin their employ as trainer.\r\n\r\nBefore going to work in earnest on this investigation, I learned that\r\nMr. Llewellyn Holton, a son of Captain John A. Holton, still resided on\r\nthe old farm and that he was old enough to know all about the origin and\r\nhistory of Maria Russell, as well as the other stock belonging to his\r\nfather at that time. This was very encouraging, but I wanted to know\r\nwhether he was a man who could be relied upon to tell the truth. On\r\nthis point I addressed an inquiry to the late Colonel R. P. Pepper, and\r\nhis reply is as follows: “Your letter of the 29th received. I regard L.\r\nHolton, of this county, as a man of honor, integrity and intelligence,\r\nand the peer of any gentleman of my acquaintance. In my opinion any\r\nstatement he will make upon any subject, as to his own knowledge, will\r\nbe accepted in this community as readily as that of any gentleman in it.\r\nHe is a man who sometimes gets on sprees from intoxicating liquors, but\r\nI have never heard of it affecting his intelligence, honor or integrity,\r\nand, as above stated, his word will be accepted in this community at this\r\ntime as soon as the word of any gentleman in this county or community.”\r\n\r\nWith this very high indorsement I did not hesitate to send a commissioner\r\nto interview Mr. Holton and get from him the exact facts in the case,\r\nwithout any leading questions and without any shading of the truth or\r\nbias on either side. What this commissioner learned will be given further\r\non.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the other side and see how Mr. Brodhead manages to get\r\nMaria Russell into the ownership of Captain John W. Russell. Under date\r\nof April 30, 1883, he wrote to the _Turf, Field and Farm_ as follows:\r\n\r\n    “A Colonel Shepherd, of the South—New Orleans, I think—gave\r\n    or sold to Captain J. W. Russell and Captain J. A. Holton a\r\n    Stockholder mare, out of Miranda, by Topgallant, etc. This mare\r\n    was called Miss Shepherd. They owned and bred this mare in\r\n    partnership. Among the produce thus owned were Maria Russell\r\n    by Rattler, Mary Bell by Sea Gull, and Swiss Boy by imported\r\n    Swiss. Captain Russell sold his half of Swiss Boy to Mr.\r\n    Taylor, son-in-law of Ben Luckett, for $750. Maria Russell was\r\n    owned and run as a partnership mare by Holton and Russell, but\r\n    was trained by Major Ben Luckett.”\r\n\r\nThen follows a lot of stuff, without any relevancy whatever, going\r\nto show that Ben Luckett trained her at three years old, but had no\r\nconnection whatever with the family, all of which is known to everybody,\r\nand then he again asserts that “in the division of the partnership\r\nproperty, Maria Russell fell to Captain Russell.” The next dash that\r\nMr. Brodhead makes is for a negro seventy-five years old, who had been\r\nin the Russell family from his birth, named Jesse Dillon. Jesse was no\r\nexception to his race, or indeed to many of the white race, for whenever\r\nany information is wanted from them they are always ready to give it, as\r\nthey expect at least one half-dollar, and if they tell the story “right\r\nup to what is wanted” they expect two. Jesse was sharp enough to discover\r\njust what his interviewers were after, and he was ready to supply “the\r\nlong-felt want.” Jesse was able to tell just how the mare got her eye\r\nknocked out and just how he took her to Blackburn’s and had her bred\r\nto Boston. In all this, including the loss of the eye and the trip to\r\nBlackburn’s, Jesse may have had in his mind Captain Russell’s one-eyed\r\nmare, Mary Churchill, while his interviewers were thinking about Maria\r\nRussell. It is no uncommon thing for white people as well as black, at\r\nseventy-five, to get names of forty or fifty years past confused.\r\n\r\nThis is all of Mr. Brodhead’s case so far as what he presents has any\r\nrelevancy to the point at issue, namely, the identity and ownership\r\nof the mare Maria Russell. The pedigree was not made at Woodburn; Mr.\r\nAlexander in this case as in many others was simply the victim of the\r\nsharper. The only shadow of evidence that has been presented that the\r\npedigree might be true is the evidence of a superannuated negro, Jesse\r\nDillon. For the Woodburn side of the case the reader is referred to\r\n_Wallace’s Monthly_ for June, 1883, page 366. In replying to this case I\r\nwill try to summarize the different considerations as briefly as possible.\r\n\r\n_First._ The case is opened with the assumption that Colonel Shepherd\r\npresented the mare Miss Shepherd, by Stockholder, to Captain J. W.\r\nRussell and Captain J. A. Holton. We might laugh at this by asking\r\nwhich half he gave to Russell and which half to Holton? This is\r\nmerely constructing a theory by which the ownership of Russell might\r\nbe maintained. It is safe to say the mare was given to Holton and to\r\nHolton alone, and here is the proof of it. There is a silver cup, now in\r\npossession of Mr. Bowen, grandson of J. A. Holton, with this inscription:\r\n“J. A. Holton, awarded by Franklyn Agricultural Society, 1836, for filly\r\nMaria Russell.” Where is Captain J. W. Russell’s ownership at that date?\r\n\r\n_Second._ When S. D. Bruce was compiling his Stud Book, Captain John W.\r\nRussell had his thoroughbred stock entered there. There were several\r\nbrood mares with their produce under them, but where were Maria Russell\r\nand her daughter Sally Russell? They appear as the property of Ben\r\nLuckett, when everybody knows he had nothing to do with them. As Captain\r\nRussell did not have them entered when he was entering his other stock, I\r\nmust take it as _prima facie_ evidence that he did not own them at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n_Third._ It is now in imperishable evidence that John W. Russell did\r\nnot own Maria Russell in 1836, and that he did not own her at the time\r\nBruce was compiling his Stud Book, and now the question is, was there\r\never a time when he did own her? To answer this question we must turn to\r\nLlewellyn Holton, the only man then living who knew and had a right to\r\nknow all about the history of this mare. His statement is as follows:\r\n\r\n                                   “FORKS OF ELKHORN. May 24, 1883.\r\n\r\n    “This is to certify that my father, Captain John A. Holton,\r\n    was, for a number of years, interested with Captain John W.\r\n    Russell in a number of thoroughbreds, and they raced them in\r\n    partnership. When they dissolved and divided the stock, I am\r\n    positively certain that my father retained all the descendants\r\n    of the Stockholder mare—among them Maria Russell, and all\r\n    her produce—and I know to my certain knowledge that Captain\r\n    Russell never owned or had in his possession the mare Maria\r\n    Russell, or any of her produce; and I further know to my\r\n    certain knowledge that said mare, Maria Russell, had two good\r\n    eyes from the time of her foaling until the day of her death.\r\n    If my father bred a mare to Boston in 1848, I incline to the\r\n    opinion that it was a bay mare called Limber, for the reason\r\n    that she, Limber, was very uncertain, having missed several\r\n    seasons. There is one point, however, that I feel very certain\r\n    upon, and that is that neither my father nor Captain Russell,\r\n    during their racing or breeding career, ever owned a Boston\r\n    filly. As Boston was the most famous horse of his time, it is\r\n    not at all possible that there could have been a Boston colt\r\n    or filly on my father’s farm and I not knowing of the fact. I\r\n    was born in the old homestead the 15th of November, 1820, and\r\n    have resided either there or adjoining all my life; therefore I\r\n    had constant opportunity to know all about my father’s stock of\r\n    horses.\r\n\r\n                                                         L. HOLTON.\r\n\r\n    “I hereby attest that the above is my father’s signature.—J. A.\r\n    HOLTON, son of Llewellyn Holton.”\r\n\r\n_Fourth._ With the foregoing clear and decisive statement before us, it\r\nis not necessary to determine whether the partnership between Holton and\r\nRussell embraced the joint ownership of the racing stock or whether the\r\nrunning colts of the two farms were brought together from year to year,\r\nand as a matter of economy and profit, trained and raced as one stable.\r\nThis latter view of the question seems to be made plain. In his interview\r\nwith Mr. Holton my commissioner reported as follows: “The horses were\r\nalways trained by Captain Holton at his private track at the Forks of\r\nElkhorn. That he, Llewellyn Holton, always went after the colts that\r\nwere on the Russell farm when the training season commenced, and at the\r\nclose of the racing campaign of the year he always took those back that\r\ncame from the Russell stock, while those from Captain Holton’s stock were\r\nkept on the home farm. When the partnership between Captain Holton and\r\nCaptain Russell was dissolved, Mr. Llewellyn Holton is positively certain\r\nthat Captain Russell retained his own stock and Captain Holton his own,\r\nthe latter consisting of the produce of the Stockholder mare, among them\r\nMaria Russell, and all her produce. And he is still more positively\r\ncertain that neither the mare, Maria Russell, nor any of her produce was\r\never in the hands of Captain Russell.” At the close of each season the\r\nowners, respectively, took their own stock home till the next spring, and\r\nafter a series of years each owner took his own stock home, and that was\r\nthe end of the arrangement.\r\n\r\n_Fifth._ In the summer of 1883 I met Mr. John W. Russell, son of Captain\r\nRussell, at the house of Mr. R. S. Veech, near Louisville, Kentucky,\r\nand we had some conversation on the question of the pedigree of Sally\r\nRussell, which had then been in hot controversy for some months. The\r\nsubject was not a pleasant one to him and he either parried or negatived\r\nthe few questions I asked. A year or two after this I met him at the\r\nGalt House in Louisville, and we had a very pleasant conversation. The\r\ncontroversy about Sally Russell had then subsided, and I asked him if\r\nhe remembered his father’s thoroughbred mare Mary Churchill. “Oh, yes,”\r\nhe said, “she was the first horse I ever rode, and my folks were very\r\nmuch afraid I would fall off and get hurt.” I then asked him if Mary\r\nChurchill was blind of one eye, and he answered he “could not remember.”\r\nMy next question was, whether he recollected anything about Maria\r\nRussell, and his reply was: “Nothing that is definite.” Then followed\r\nthe inquiry, “whether there were any traditions in the household going\r\nto show that his father ever owned Maria Russell,” and he replied:\r\n“There are no traditions that are reliable.” These replies were a most\r\ngrateful surprise to me, and if I have not given the precise words used I\r\ncertainly have given the precise meaning.\r\n\r\n_Sixth._ Llewellyn Holton was sixty-three years old in 1883 and he was\r\nafflicted with physical paralysis, but his mind seems to have been\r\nperfectly sound and memory good for a man of his age. Before he had the\r\nslightest intimation that a pedigree was being investigated that might\r\ncall him into controversy, he was asked about Maria Russell by one of the\r\nmost prominent and distinguished of all the breeders of Kentucky, and\r\nthat breeder wrote me as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I have seen Mr. L. Holton, the son of Captain John A.\r\n    Holton, of this county, and he says his father bred and owned\r\n    Maria Russell; that she was by Rattler, and out of a mare by\r\n    Stockholder, and was foaled 1834. He says he thinks a man by\r\n    the name of William Duvall can give some information about\r\n    these mares. I will see him to-morrow, and write you.”\r\n\r\nAs this information about Maria Russell was elicited from Mr. Holton\r\non the spur of the moment, and as he gave her pedigree correctly, and\r\nnot only this, but gave the year in which she was foaled correctly, his\r\nmemory, at least so far as this mare is concerned seems to have been\r\nremarkably good.\r\n\r\n_Seventh._ My correspondent wrote a few days later: “I have just\r\nlearned from William Duvall, who trained for Captain J. A. Holton in\r\n1842, that he remembers the mare Maria Russell, and he thinks she was\r\nby Seagull, and out of Limber, by Whipster; he also remembers a mare\r\nowned by Holton that was by Rattler, but cannot remember any more about\r\nher.” This confirms Mr. Holton’s recollections in a very striking and\r\nsatisfactory manner. As a trainer Mr. Duvall did not handle the brood\r\nmares, but only their produce. He recalled a Seagull mare and a Rattler\r\nmare, that Captain Holton owned, but he attached the name “Maria Russell”\r\nto the wrong one. This kind of impromptu inaccuracy is almost always an\r\nelement of strength, for it goes to prove that the witness has not been\r\n“coached.” He remembered there was a mare by Rattler in the field, and\r\nas there was no other Rattler mare owned by either Holton or Russell,\r\nthe identity of Maria Russell is clearly established as the property of\r\nCaptain Holton in 1842.\r\n\r\n_Eighth._ With the high indorsement of Mr. Llewellyn Holton as a man of\r\ntruth and honor, given on page 421 of this chapter; and with the evidence\r\nbefore me of his clear and unclouded memory in giving correctly not only\r\nthe pedigrees but the year in which Maria Russell was foaled, and all\r\nthis before there was any pressure or suspicion on his part as to where\r\nhis disclosure might lead, I cannot, as an honest man, fail to believe\r\nthat he told the truth. Thus, after leaving out all the minor evidences,\r\nwe have the three major points fully and clearly established, namely, (1)\r\nthe inscription on the silver cup that Captain Holton owned her in 1836;\r\n(2) the evidence of William Duvall that he owned her in 1842; and (3) the\r\nstatement of Llewellyn Holton that he owned her always and that she died\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n_Ninth._ At the Woodburn sale of 1863 and 1868 there were certainly at\r\nleast two hundred experienced horsemen and breeders present who were able\r\nto discriminate concerning a mare represented to be thirteen years old\r\nwhen she looked ten years more; or concerning a mare represented to be\r\neighteen years old when she looked as if she were twenty-eight. Hence,\r\nno man was willing to bid five dollars on her. This I take it, was the\r\npersonal judgment of every man who thought anything about it, and when\r\nshe died a few weeks after the last sale, nobody could doubt that she\r\ndied of old age, and nobody could doubt that Mr. Alexander represented\r\nher to the public just as she had been represented to him, both in age\r\nand breeding, by the rogue who victimized him.\r\n\r\nThe mare Sally Russell, the grandam of Maud S., had been sold to Mr.\r\nAlexander by the foreman of Captain Russell’s farm, and it does not\r\nappear that he represented her as having been bred by Captain Russell.\r\nIndeed, it was not claimed at Woodburn that Captain Russell bred her\r\nuntil a representative of that establishment called at my office to\r\nexamine the service books of Boston and there found that “John Russell’s\r\none-eyed mare” had been bred in 1849. If a fraud, therefore, was\r\nestablished the Russell family must bear the odium. Hence all evidence\r\nfrom that source must be considered in the light of the fact that\r\nevery member of the family is deeply interested. But notwithstanding\r\nthe efforts of the Russell family to preserve the father’s name from\r\nobloquy, and notwithstanding the trip in search of some superannuated\r\ndarkey who could remember anything and everything in consideration of\r\nthe _pour-boire_ that would be forthcoming, there stood that terrible\r\nstatement of Llewellyn Holton that could not be met by evidence. The\r\nwhole matter was against him, and Mr. Brodhead was not happy. He knew\r\nhe could not prove him wrong, and the only course left open was to get\r\nhim to take back certain things that he had said on the ground that his\r\nmemory had failed and that the fight was between “Old Kaintuck” and\r\noutside parties who had no business to interfere with Kentucky affairs.\r\nOn an appointed day, therefore, all who were supposed to have any\r\ninfluence with Mr. Holton, in the whole countryside, met Mr. Brodhead,\r\nand they came down on “the poor old paralytic” hammer and tongs. They\r\nasked him what he remembered about all the horses, each in his turn, in\r\nthe whole neighborhood, whether he had ever heard of them before or not.\r\nThis was kept up a long time, but they could not prevail on him to take\r\nback a single specific statement he had made. He had said Captain Russell\r\nhad never owned Maria Russell or any of her produce, and he would not\r\ntake it back. He had said Maria Russell had two good eyes when she died,\r\nand he would not take it back. At last when the poor old invalid was\r\nworn out they sprung the patriotic dodge of “Kentucky against the world”\r\nupon him and this had some effect, but not enough to save the anxious\r\n“bulldozers” from a feeling of great depression. At last Mr. Brodhead\r\nseized a pen and indited a letter for him to sign, addressed to me,\r\nwith the request that I would publish it. I am not able to say how many\r\nattempts were made to get such a letter as he would be willing to sign,\r\nbut several different drafts were made, and sick and worried, and in\r\norder to get rid of his tormentors, he signed, and the letter came to me,\r\nand I published it as follows:\r\n\r\n                                  “FORKS OF ELKHORN, June 12, 1883.\r\n\r\n    “Mr. J. H. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR SIR: In answer to your letter to my son, of May 21, 1883,\r\n    there are three points suggested. First, in regard to her\r\n    produce (Maria Russell’s). I have no recollection any further.\r\n    I have no data from which I could find out concerning them.\r\n    Second, I have no remembrance of her death nor the manner of\r\n    it. Now, in regard to the statement I made to Mr. John K.\r\n    Stringfield. I think he has made it too strong, for I told him\r\n    my statement was from memory only, and that I could not nor\r\n    would not swear to it. Since that time I have had sufficient\r\n    proof to overbalance my memory, and circumstances called to\r\n    mind that have convinced me I was in error. I simply stated\r\n    what I believed to be true at that time. I have no interest in\r\n    the matter whatever—only want to be understood. I trust that\r\n    you will oblige me by publishing the above letter.\r\n\r\n                           Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                                       “L. HOLTON.”\r\n\r\nIt must have been a most pitiful sight to see six or eight able-bodied\r\nmen, headed by the stalwart Brodhead, acting as chief inquisitor,\r\ncircling round the reclining form of a poor old invalid, trying to\r\nconvince him that he had no memory and that he was a liar, prodding\r\nhim with questions about horses that he never had heard of, and when\r\nhe failed to tell them, torturing him with remarks that if he couldn’t\r\nanswer that question how could he know so well about Maria Russell? But\r\nwith all their tortures they couldn’t force him to say his father did not\r\nown Maria Russell all her life and that she did not die with two good\r\neyes. It was simply a little Spanish Inquisition on the waters of the\r\nElkhorn from which came the cry, “Recant, Recant,” dinged into the ears\r\nof the helpless paralytic. Still, helpless as he was against so many, he\r\nobeyed his conscience and maintained his integrity, notwithstanding all\r\nthe satanic arts of Torquemada. When all else had failed the war-cry was\r\nshouted in his ear: “New York is trying to destroy the breeding interests\r\nof Kentucky, and all true Kentuckians must stand by each other or we all\r\ngo under.” The old man brightened up and said: “I’m a Kentuckian, but you\r\nmustn’t try to make me a self-convicted liar.” The piece of patchwork\r\ngiven above, in the shape of a letter, was then shaped up by his\r\ntormentors, for the old man was not able to write a line, and dispatched\r\nto the office of _Wallace’s Monthly_, where it was printed just as it was\r\nreceived. Each one of the tormentors made a copy of it, and no one of\r\nthem was satisfied with it; even the inquisitor-general said it fell far\r\nshort of what they wanted, but that by industriously speaking of it as a\r\nrecantation, the public would soon come to treat it as a recantation.\r\n\r\nWhen, after years of fruitless effort, Mr. Brodhead, manager at Woodburn\r\nFarm, got control of registration, he made an early move to have the\r\ncloud removed from the pedigree of the stallion Lord Russell, and brought\r\nthe matter before the neocracy of his own creation, of which he was\r\nhimself the head and brains, and the action thereon was published in\r\n_Wallace’s Monthly_ for February, 1893. The presentation is imposing\r\nin length and abounds in many things that have no possible bearing on\r\nthe question at issue. Unfortunately I have no means of determining the\r\nextent to which the crime of the interpolation or excision has been made\r\nmanifest except in two of the exhibits which I will give. In Exhibit\r\n1 (Holton’s letter above) the following words are interpolated: “and\r\nin justice to all I correct my statement.” These words are not very\r\nimportant to the meaning, but they are very important as indicating\r\nthe accuracy, and hence reliability, of a witness. In the same exhibit\r\nMr. Brodhead says: “I insist that you will oblige me,” etc., while the\r\noriginal uses the word “trust” instead of “insist.” Again, Mr. Brodhead\r\nhas his letter dated June 11, 1893, instead of June 12, 1883, as it is\r\nin the original. The variation of the dates here seems to have had a\r\npurpose, whatever it may have been. This letter must have been a great\r\ntrouble, for I have seen three or four copies of it, so called, and no\r\ntwo of them alike.\r\n\r\nI was duly notified that the question of Sally Russell’s pedigree would\r\nbe brought up at that meeting, and requested to be there to sustain my\r\nview of that question. The court and the jury were made up of Brodhead’s\r\ncreatures, and organized simply to register his edicts. The wise man\r\nsaid, “Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.” The\r\nbird looked on, from a safe distance, and saw the fowler impaled in his\r\nown snare, by his own act, and his true character revealed to the world.\r\nIt is very difficult to understand just why it should have been deemed\r\nnecessary to cut out the very pith and heart of Mr. Holton’s letter, when\r\nhe knew that it would make no difference with his court whether there was\r\nany evidence at all. Under the law of retribution, a man’s character may\r\nbe determined by his own acts.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLTON’S TRUE STATEMENT.\r\n\r\n“FORKS OF ELKHORN, May 24, 1883.\r\n\r\n“This is to certify that my father, Captain John A. Holton, was for a\r\nnumber of years interested with Captain John Russell in a number of\r\nthoroughbreds, and they raced them in partnership. When they dissolved\r\nand divided the stock, I am positively certain that my father retained\r\nall the descendants of the Stockholder mare—among them Maria Russell\r\nand all of her produce AND I KNOW TO MY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE THAT CAPTAIN\r\nRUSSELL NEVER OWNED OR HAD IN HIS POSSESSION THE MARE MARIA RUSSELL,\r\nOR ANY OF HER PRODUCE. And I further know to my certain knowledge that\r\nsaid mare, Maria Russell, had two good eyes from the time of her foaling\r\nuntil the day of her death. If my father bred a mare to Boston in 1848, I\r\nincline to the opinion that it was a bay mare we owned called Limber, for\r\nthe reason that she, Limber, was very uncertain, having missed several\r\nseasons. There is one point, however, that I feel very certain upon, and\r\nthat is, that neither my father nor Captain Russell, during their racing\r\nor breeding career, ever owned a Boston filly. As Boston was the most\r\nfamous horse of his time, it is not at all possible that there could\r\nhave been a Boston colt or filly on my father’s farm and I not knowing\r\nof the fact. I was born in the old homestead the 15th of November, 1820,\r\nand have resided either there or adjoining all my life; therefore I had\r\nconstant opportunity to know all about my father’s stock of horses.\r\n\r\n                                                              L. HOLTON.\r\n\r\n“I hereby attest that the above is my father’s signature.—J. A. HOLTON,\r\nson of Llewellyn Holton.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBRODHEAD’S REPRESENTATION OF IT.\r\n\r\n“FORKS, ELKHORN, May 24, 1883.\r\n\r\n“This is to certify that my father, Captain John A. Holton, was for a\r\nnumber of years interested with Captain John Russell in a number of\r\nthoroughbreds, and they raced them in partnership. When they dissolved,\r\nand divided the stock, I am positively certain that my father retained\r\nall the descendants of the Stockholder mare, among them Maria Russell\r\nand all her produce, and I know to my certain knowledge that said Maria\r\nRussell had two good eyes from the time of her foaling until the day of\r\nher death. If my father bred a mare to Boston in 1848, I incline to the\r\nopinion that it was a bay mare he owned called Limber, for the reason\r\nthat she, Limber, was very uncertain, having missed several seasons.\r\nThere is one point, however, that I feel very certain upon, and that\r\nis that neither my father nor Captain Russell during their racing or\r\nbreeding career ever owned a Boston filly. As Boston was the most famous\r\nhorse of his time, it is not at all possible that there could have been a\r\nBoston colt or filly on my father’s farm and I not knowing of the fact.\r\nI was born in the old homestead the 15th of November, 1820, and have\r\nresided either there or adjoining all my life; therefore I had constant\r\nopportunity to know all about my father’s stock of horses.\r\n\r\n                                                              L. HOLTON.\r\n\r\n“I hereby attest that the above is my father’s signature.—J. A. HOLTON,\r\nson of L. Holton.”\r\n\r\nThe deadly parallel columns tell the whole story. The central and most\r\nimportant fact in Mr. Holton’s statement has been deliberately and\r\ncarefully cut out by Mr. Brodhead, and the evidence that he did so cannot\r\nbe wiped out either by money or by the torture of invalids. The testimony\r\nof cold type remains forever. Has Mr. Brodhead, it is asked, professed to\r\nhave given the whole of Mr. Holton’s statement, and suppressed a vital\r\npart of it? He has given every word and letter of the statement, from\r\nthe date line to the signature, except the one sentence that is the life\r\nand soul of the whole statement, and that sentence I have printed above\r\nin capital letters, so that it may be easily distinguished and compared.\r\nFor years I have known that Mr. Brodhead possessed most remarkable visual\r\npowers. When he wanted to see a thing he could see it through a stone\r\nwall and without any assistance from the “X-rays,” and when he didn’t\r\nwant to see a thing he couldn’t see it even when held up to his very\r\nnose under an arc light. The deception practiced here might justly be\r\ndesignated by a harder name, for it was deliberately planned and carried\r\nout in order to gain an end by suppressing the truth. Why did he not\r\nfree himself from his marvelous powers of vision, and looking out of the\r\nnatural eyes of his mind, see the imminent danger of a terrible exposure?\r\nIn keeping back part of the truth with the pretension that he had given\r\nit all, how could he avoid recalling the fate of Annanias and Sapphira\r\nfor keeping back part of the price with the pretension that they had\r\ngiven it all?\r\n\r\nAs an exercise in ethical athletics I will submit the following abstract\r\nquestion to the debating clubs, especially in Kentucky, viz., “Is the man\r\nwho suppresses the truth in order to sustain a fraudulent pedigree any\r\nmore worthy of belief than the man who made the pedigree and sold the\r\nhorse upon it?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATION OF DISPUTED PEDIGREES.—(_Continued_.)\r\n\r\n    How Belle of Wabash got her pedigree—Specimen of pedigree\r\n    making in that day and locality—Search for the dam of Thomas\r\n    Jefferson—True origin and history of Belle of Wabash—Facts\r\n    about the old-time gelding Prince—The truth about Waxy, the\r\n    grandam of Sunol—Remarkable attempts to make a pedigree out\r\n    of nothing—How “Jim” Eoff worked a “tenderfoot”—Pedigree of\r\n    American Eclipse—Pedigree of Boston—Tom Bowling and Aaron\r\n    Pennington—Chenery’s Gray Eagle—Pedigree of George Wilkes in\r\n    doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Louisville, Kentucky, October, 1860, a ten-mile race was trotted which\r\nexcited a good deal of local interest and comment. The contestants in\r\nthis race were entered as follows:\r\n\r\n  “Captain Magowan, by imp. Sovereign, dam by American Eclipse.”\r\n  “Gipsy Queen, by Wagner, dam by imp. Glencoe.”\r\n  “Belle of Wabash (Indiana Belle), by Bassinger, dam by imp. William.”\r\n\r\nThe names of the parties making the entries are given in the entries of\r\nthe first and second, and the Louisville _Journal_ of the week before\r\nremarks that “J. J. Alexander will represent his State honorably with the\r\nBelle of Indiana.” Captain Magowan held the lead from start to finish,\r\nand at the end of the eighth mile, some say the seventh, Belle of Wabash\r\nwas drawn. It will be observed that, so far as given, each one of these\r\nanimals was furnished with a first-class race-horse pedigree; for it\r\nwas then held as firmly as any religious tenet that no horse could go\r\nthat distance at any gait unless he was strictly thoroughbred, and, in\r\nKentucky, if he did not have such a pedigree they gave him one on the\r\nspot. At that time they never bothered their heads hunting up the breeder\r\nof an animal to learn how it was bred. They simply wanted to see the\r\nperformance and then make the pedigree to suit it. These three pedigrees\r\nwere all bogus in all their elements, and I knew so little of the ways\r\nof the horse world, at that time, that I accepted and recorded them as\r\ngenuine.\r\n\r\nCaptain Magowan was a roan gelding, willful and bad tempered, and all\r\nthat seems to be known about his origin is the conceded fact that he was\r\nbred in Kentucky and that he was probably descended from the tribe of\r\nCopperbottoms, or possibly the Tom Hals. The roan color prevailed in both\r\ntribes and the horse himself looked like the Copperbottoms.\r\n\r\nGipsy Queen, at the time of the above race in 1860, was owned by a\r\n“sporting man” named George Bidwell, of Chicago, or at least she raced\r\nunder his direction. About the time of this race, Mr. Thomas J. Vail\r\nbought the mare and took her to Hartford, Connecticut. He bred her to\r\nToronto Chief and she produced a black colt. The mare and colt afterward\r\npassed into the hands of Mr. William B. Smith, and this colt grew up to\r\nbe the famous Thomas Jefferson—“The Whirlwind of the East.” In connection\r\nwith Mr. Smith I devoted a good deal of labor to a futile search for the\r\norigin and pedigree of this mare, and the result of our search amounted\r\nto nothing more than a reasonable probability that she was bred at\r\nRochester, New York; was got by a son or grandson of Vermont Black Hawk\r\nand was taken from there to Chicago. This latter point of the transfer to\r\nChicago seemed to be quite circumstantially fixed in Mr. Smith’s mind.\r\n\r\nMr. Allen W. Thomson, of Woodstock, Vermont—a man of great industry and a\r\nlover of the truth for the truth’s sake—also made an exhaustive search,\r\nand from a recent contribution to the press he evidently thinks he has\r\nfound it, and possibly he has; but while I generally agree with Mr.\r\nThomson’s conclusions, and prize them as honest and carefully reached,\r\nI am forced to dissent in this case. Without going into details, he\r\nbrings the mare from Williamstown, Vermont, and takes her to Woodstock,\r\nIllinois, where she is paired with another black mare, and after passing\r\nthrough two or three hands they at last land in a public livery stable\r\nin Chicago, and there the identity of the suppositious Gipsy Queen is\r\nlost, and so far as known she never came out of that stable. One or\r\ntwo years afterward a black mare from Chicago, in possession of George\r\nBidwell, appeared in some public races, notably the one given above, and\r\nthe conclusion is at once reached that this black mare, Gipsy Queen,\r\nwas the black filly brought from Williamstown, Vermont. To this all the\r\nintermediate owners between Williamstown and Behrens’ livery stable were\r\nready to insist that this black mare was the Williamstown filly, but not\r\none of them had ever seen the mare that George Bidwell was handling, and\r\nsome of them evidently were not worthy of belief if they had seen her.\r\nThere is the “missing link” between Behrens’ stable and George Bidwell,\r\nthat has not been supplied and probably never can be supplied. The\r\nchances that the Williamstown filly was the real Gipsy Queen, all things\r\nconsidered, seem to stand as about one to a thousand. We must, therefore,\r\nconclude that we have no satisfactory information as to how or where this\r\nmare was bred.\r\n\r\nBELLE OF WABASH.—My first inquiry about this mare was made more than\r\ntwenty-five years ago, and I did not then suppose that her pedigree would\r\never become a question of any general interest. In the first volume of\r\nthe Register I had entered her as a black mare, foaled 1852, got by\r\nBassinger, son of Lieutenant Bassinger, and dam said to be by imported\r\nWilliam IV. She was then owned by George C. Stevens of Milwaukee,\r\nWisconsin. After her son—The Moor—proved himself a great sire of trotters\r\nin getting Beautiful Bells, Sultan, and other good ones, her pedigree\r\nbecame a question of very great importance. As the search for it would\r\noccupy more space, in detail, than I can give to it in these pages, I\r\nwill here give the references in _Wallace’s Monthly_, where the principal\r\ncorrespondence may be found: Vol. XIV., p. 510; XV., p. 441; XVI., p. 43;\r\nand for a complete understanding of the matter the references here given\r\nshould be carefully examined.\r\n\r\nMr. S. D. Puett, of Indiana, was the first to give me a starting point in\r\nthe investigation of the pedigree of this mare. In all that had been said\r\nabout her I never was able to find a man who really knew anything about\r\nher origin, until Mr. Puett gave me the address of Cyrus Romaine, who had\r\nowned her when very young and handled her for speed. He says “she was\r\nsired by a colt from her own dam, that was got by a Copperbottom stallion\r\nfrom Kentucky.” He was not able to give any information about the sire of\r\nthe dam, and as to the gait of the dam he says: “Her dam was a natural\r\npacer. I cannot say as to her sire, as he was unbroken at the time.” He\r\nbought the mare at three years old, handled her one year and sold her to\r\nMr. J. J. Alexander, of Montezuma, of the same county (Parke), in 1856.\r\nMr. Alexander still owned her in 1860 when she trotted in Louisville,\r\nand after his death Williams, his trainer, married his widow and still\r\ncontrolled the mare. Mr. Romaine failed to give the name of the breeder\r\nof the mare, which will be explained further on. Soon after he wrote,\r\nApril 26, 1880, he removed to Nebraska and I have not heard from him\r\nsince. In 1857 she was trained for Mr. Alexander by John Williams on\r\nStroue’s track at Rockville, Indiana, the county seat of Parke County.\r\nIn 1860 she was entered by Williams in several races at Indianapolis\r\nand at other points, and made a record of 2:40. About 1865, or perhaps\r\na year or two earlier, she became the property of George C. Stevens. In\r\nhis catalogue for 1868 she is entered merely as “Old Belle,” and he know\r\nnothing of her origin or history till I gave it to him, along with the\r\nhumbug pedigree that I had copied from the entries at the Louisville\r\nten-mile race.\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of Mr. Puett I received the following letter from\r\nMr. Henry C. Brown, a very reputable business man and a grain dealer\r\nin Rockville, Parke County, Indiana. This letter from Mr. Brown has in\r\nit such evidence of candor and intelligence that I will here insert it\r\nentire:\r\n\r\n    “DEAR SIR: In reply to your inquiry of the 23d ult., as to what\r\n    I know of the ‘origin and history of the mare called Belle of\r\n    Wabash,’ I will give you the following _facts_:\r\n\r\n    “In the year 1855, or ’56, I am not positive which, this mare,\r\n    when a three-year-old, was purchased by Cyrus Romaine, then a\r\n    resident of this county, of an old farmer in Clay County, this\r\n    State, paying $85 for her. This farmer lived at that time about\r\n    a mile and a half north of Brazil, the present county-seat of\r\n    Clay County.\r\n\r\n    “As to this farmer’s name, neither myself nor Romaine can tell.\r\n    He was an old man at that time, and undoubtedly has gone to his\r\n    reward long ago. _Neither do we know anything at all about the\r\n    pedigree of the mare._\r\n\r\n    “There is no person living, so far as I or Romaine know, that\r\n    can tell anything about her ancestors, and in my opinion it\r\n    would be impossible, at this late day, to find any one in Clay\r\n    County that could give us any information in regard to her.\r\n\r\n    “The country around Brazil at that time was almost a\r\n    wilderness; now the city is spread out, and covers, no doubt,\r\n    the farm where the mare was foaled. Clay County is now the\r\n    center of the Indiana coal-fields, and, of course, the entire\r\n    face of the country about there is changed wonderfully since\r\n    1856; consequently it would be almost if not quite impossible\r\n    to find the exact location.\r\n\r\n    “After keeping the mare eight or nine months, Romaine sold\r\n    her to John Alexander, of Montezuma, this county, for $160.\r\n    Alexander soon after commenced training her, and in about one\r\n    year I think he, or his trainer, John Williams, took her to\r\n    Kentucky, and entered her there in some kind of races. Since\r\n    then you know her history much better than I do.\r\n\r\n    “At the time Romaine bought the mare he and I were trading in\r\n    stock together, boarding at the same house and sleeping in the\r\n    same bed. I mention, this only that you may understand that I\r\n    know what I am writing about.\r\n\r\n    “I am truly sorry that I cannot give you the true pedigree\r\n    of the mare, but it cannot be done. There is no man here or\r\n    anywhere else that can tell you anything more than I have\r\n    stated herein.\r\n\r\n    “You will no doubt think that there is considerable of\r\n    superfluous matter in this letter, but I do not see how I could\r\n    tell you what I wanted to in fewer words.\r\n\r\n    “Everything stated herein is _truth_, and, if necessary, I am\r\n    willing to make affidavit to the same at any time.\r\n\r\n                         Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                  “HENRY C. BROWN.”\r\n\r\nMr. Romaine’s representation amounted to nothing definite or satisfactory\r\nabout the pedigree of Belle of Wabash, because he failed to give the name\r\nand location of her breeder, but Mr. Brown’s letter clears this all up\r\non the grounds that Mr. Romaine really did not know the breeder’s name.\r\nWhatever her sire and whatever her dam, we may feel sure they were not\r\ntrotting-bred, although she was a trotter. We are left, therefore, to\r\nconclude that, as in a thousand other cases, this mare was a pacing-bred\r\ntrotter. The one point that is vital is settled by Mr. Brown, as he\r\nwas with Mr. Romaine when he bought the mare and knew all about the\r\ntransaction. He cannot remember the breeder’s name, but he locates him\r\nas “living a mile and a half north of Brazil,” and that it is now all\r\ncut up into residence and mining lots. This seems to fix the location\r\nof the breeder beyond all doubt. This old man seems to have been a\r\npioneer in a very poor county and still a comparative wilderness when\r\nthis transaction took place. At that time the coal fields had not been\r\ntouched, and it is wholly beyond belief that he took his unknown old mare\r\nout of his own county, across the adjoining county of Parke and into\r\nVermilion County, wherever in it Mr. Weisiger lived, to have her bred\r\nto his part-bred stallion Bassinger. And then when he came to sell the\r\nfoal at three years old for $85, when horses were high, can we believe\r\nhe would do so without ever mentioning how the filly was bred? The chain\r\nof ownership is complete, as she passed from her unnamed breeder to Mr.\r\nRomaine, from him to Mr. Alexander, in whose hands she did her trotting,\r\nand then to Mr. Williams, and there is no place for the Louisville humbug\r\npedigree to come in. She got her bogus pedigree at the same time and in\r\nthe same way that Magowan and Gipsy Queen got theirs, and there was not a\r\nsingle shadow of truth in any one of them. The tenacity with which some\r\npeople hold on to a “thoroughbred” origin for their trotters when the\r\nevidence is all against them has long been a mystery to honest folks,\r\nwho are able to look at things as they are; but it is not difficult to\r\nunderstand the phenomenon when we analyze the reasons for it. First,\r\nthe owner is anxious to hold on to all he can possibly claim in the way\r\nof aristocratic descent with the hope that it may help his sales; and\r\nsecond, there are always a few “featherheads” with golden pockets ready\r\nto buy that kind of stuff, because they have never gone far enough in\r\nhorse history to be able to kick themselves loose from the swaddling\r\nclothes of their infantile prejudices.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.—The chestnut gelding Prince was one of the great trotters in\r\nthe early “fifties.” He was pitted against Hero, the pacing son of\r\nHarris’ Hambletonian, Lantern and others. As usual at that time he was\r\ngiven a thoroughbred pedigree, which I was then led to accept, without\r\nreally knowing anything about his origin. He was represented to have\r\nbeen bred in Kentucky, and owned by R. Ten Broeck of that State. Then\r\nwould naturally follow a thoroughbred pedigree coming from that State,\r\nand nobody doubted it for a long time. He was represented to be by\r\nWoodpecker, son of Bertrand; dam by imported Sarpedon; grandam said to be\r\nthoroughbred. When he started in his ten-mile race against Hero, William\r\nT. Porter said he was by Woodpecker, and out of that grew the pedigree\r\nabove. In the old _Spirit of the Times_, of October 11, 1856, there is a\r\nshort communication signed “Hiram,” in which is the only circumstantial\r\naccount of the origin of Prince that I have ever seen. It is implied by\r\nthe writer that he was bred by a Mr. Dey, of Chautauqua. County, New\r\nYork, for he says he was got by “an old chestnut horse called Duroc,\r\nfrom Long Island,” and came of the Dey Mare. It seems that Dey sold the\r\ncolt to a young man named Worden, and he was first known as “the Worden\r\ncolt.” He was then sold to Manley Griswold, and from Griswold to Daniel\r\nVanvliet, who sold him in Buffalo to Bennett & Jones (or Thomas), for one\r\nthousand dollars, and they sold him to William Whelan, of Long Island,\r\nfor fifteen hundred dollars. “Hiram” carries the history of the horse\r\nno further, as he had then placed him in the hands of the great artists\r\nof the trotting world. Of his sire, “Old Duroc,” he says he was taken\r\nfrom Long Island to Villenova, in Chautauqua County, by a merchant of\r\nthat place, named George Hopkins, and after getting about twenty colts\r\nhe died. Among these twenty we find Prince and another afterward known\r\nas the Walker Horse, which achieved a high local reputation as a sire\r\nof trotters and I have frequently met with his cross in the pedigrees\r\nof good animals. This showing is not absolutely complete, but it is\r\ninfinitely better than any other that has over been given to the public.\r\n\r\nWAXY, the grandam of Sunol. When the two-year-old filly Sunol in 1888\r\ncame out and trotted a mile in 2:18, it fairly took one’s breath away,\r\nand the first question on every tongue was, “How is she bred?” She was\r\nrepresented to be by Electioneer, out of Waxana by General Benton, and\r\nshe out of Waxy by Lexington, and “thoroughbred.” When asked who bred her\r\nand how it was known that Waxy was by Lexington, the answer came back\r\nthat the breeder was not known—that she had been taken across the plains\r\nby a man who died on the way. The search then commenced for the breeder\r\nof Waxy and the identification of her dam. As the search progressed there\r\nwere some very curious things developed. When it started in the spring\r\nit was a yearling stallion colt, and when it reached California, in\r\nthe fall, it was a two-year-old filly. More than this, it was shown by\r\nindubitable proofs, such as they were, that she had two dams, and then\r\nshown that she had no dam at all. With such a Kentucky muddle on hand\r\nthere was an excellent opportunity for a controversy that might possibly\r\nbecome somewhat heated. This controversy is famous in the history of the\r\nexposures of untruthful pedigrees, and I will give a brief outline of it,\r\nwith some specimens of the evidence adduced to sustain it.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1864 Mr. John P. Welch, an intelligent man,\r\ntrained to the profession of civil engineer, reached the blue grass\r\nregion of Kentucky for the purpose of securing and taking across the\r\nplains a band of well-bred horses to California. In this venture he was\r\nbacked by Mr. John Anderson, a wealthy gentleman of the latter State. Mr.\r\nWelch was successful in perfecting his arrangements, and when on the very\r\neve of starting he sent forward a complete inventory of all the animals\r\nhe had in his band and sent this inventory to the _California Spirit\r\nof the Times_, in which paper it was published May 14, 1864, and is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n   1. Bay mare, 6 years old, by imp. Sovereign, dam by Glencoe, g. d.\r\n        Ann Merry.\r\n   2. Bay filly, 3 years, by Vandal, dam Miss Singleton by Old\r\n        Denmark, g. d. Bellamira by Monarch.\r\n   3. Bay filly, 2 years old, by Mambrino Chief, dam by Commodore.\r\n   4. Bay horse, 3 years old, by Mambrino Chief, dam by Gray Eagle.\r\n   5. Black colt, 2 years old, by Kt. of St. George, dam (dam of\r\n        Capitola) by Margrave.\r\n   6. Bay mare, 9 years old, by imp. Glencoe, dam by Rudolph, g. d.\r\n        Belle Anderson.\r\n   7. Bay filly, 2 years old, by Revenue, dam Sally Morgan by\r\n        Emancipation.\r\n   8. Chestnut filly, 4 years old, by Vandal, dam by Gray Eagle, g. d.\r\n        Churchill.\r\n   9. Chestnut mare by Wagner (dam of No. 11).\r\n  10. Bay mare by Sovereign.\r\n  11. Black colt, 2 years old, by Kt. of St. George, dam No. 9, by\r\n        Wagner.\r\n  12. Chestnut filly, 3 years old, by Jack Gamble, dam Betty King by\r\n        Boston.\r\n  13. Bay mare, 6 years old, by imp. Sovereign, dam by Mirabeau, g. d.\r\n        Arabella.\r\n  14. Captain Beard, b. s., 9 years old, by imp. Yorkshire, dam by imp.\r\n        Glencoe, g. d. by imp. Leviathan, g. g. d. by Stockholder.\r\n  15. Gray mare by Gray Eagle, dam Mary Morris, by Medoc.\r\n  16. Hope, ch. m. by Glencoe, dam Susette by Aratus.\r\n  17. Bay mare by Sovereign, dam by Gray Eagle.\r\n  18. Chestnut filly, 2 years old, by Bob Johnson, dam by Brawner’s\r\n        Eclipse.\r\n  19. Chestnut filly, 3 years old, by Kt. of St. George, dam by Gray\r\n        Eagle.\r\n  20. Bay colt, one year old, by Lexington, dam by Gray Eagle, g. d.\r\n        Mary Morris.\r\n  21. Ch. c., 2 years old by Ringgold, dam Hope by Glencoe.\r\n  22 and 23. Pair 3:00 six-year-old trotting mares.\r\n  24. Black mare, trotter, 8 years old; time, 2:50.\r\n  25. Bay gelding, trotter, 5 years old; time, near 3:00.\r\n  26. Bay mare for show, but not to go.\r\n\r\nFrom this inventory we must conclude that Mr. Welch was a careful and\r\nmethodical man. He knew he had twenty-six animals ready to start,\r\nand after he had written off the descriptions and pedigrees of these\r\ntwenty-six animals he verified his work by numbering them from one to\r\ntwenty-six inclusive, and then he knew he had not omitted any one. This\r\ninventory is the basis of the whole truth in this matter, and is the\r\nonly evidence in the wide world of what animals Mr. Welch started with\r\nto California. As this is the vital and only starting point to reach the\r\ntruth, I trust my readers will examine it again carefully and see whether\r\nit includes any filly or mare by Lexington, of any age. When you ask any\r\nof these “more-running-blood-in-the-trotter” people who took Waxy, the\r\nphantom daughter of Lexington, to California, you will get an evasive\r\nanswer, and when pressed they will at last say, John P. Welch. Now, as to\r\nJohn P. Welch, “he being dead yet speaketh.” From his unknown grave he\r\ntells these people they are trying to establish what is not true, and\r\nwith his ghostly finger points to the inventory and demands, “Where is\r\nthe Lexington filly in that list? You are trying to displace the truth\r\nwith a falsehood,” and he drives this charge home to the heart of each\r\none of them.\r\n\r\nHere we might close this case and leave it to the enlightened judgment\r\nof all intelligent and honest people, for there is not a scintilla\r\nof evidence that any two-year-old daughter of Lexington was taken to\r\nCalifornia in 1864. Until this evidence is adduced, no attempt to\r\noverthrow the contents of John P. Welch’s inventory has a single peg to\r\nstand on. But I am not yet done with some of the peculiarities that have\r\nbeen developed in this case, for long ago I learned in this pedigree\r\nbusiness,\r\n\r\n    “That for ways that are dark,\r\n    And for tricks that are vain,\r\n    The heathen Chinee is peculiar.”\r\n\r\nAt this point the case bifurcates, one fork leading to the Grey Eagle\r\nmare as the dam of Waxy, and the other to the Brawner’s Eclipse mare, and\r\nI think my language will not be wholly unparliamentary when I pronounce\r\nthem both frauds. Mr. Levi S. Gould, a worthy business man of Boston,\r\nwhom I have always esteemed as honest, was the first to dig up this whole\r\nmatter in the columns of the _California Spirit of the Times_, and the\r\nfirst to give the above inventory to the public. He traveled thousands\r\nof miles and claimed to have traced Waxy to the stable of her breeder,\r\nPhilip Swigert, of Frankfort, Kentucky. The full account of his laborious\r\ntrip was published in _Wallace’s Monthly_ for March, 1889, p. 17. In the\r\ninventory he found one animal got by Lexington, but this was a bay colt\r\nof 1863, and out of the Grey Eagle mare, but he wanted a chestnut filly.\r\nAfter studying the matter over, he concluded that this “bay colt” was a\r\ntypographical error for “chestnut filly” and that this established the\r\npedigree of Waxy. He interviewed a number of people who had known of, or\r\nhad been in some way connected with, the Welch venture, and they were\r\nall able to confirm his discovery of the typographical error, and could\r\nrecount to a nicety their distinct recollections of the sorrel filly by\r\nLexington, out of the Grey Eagle mare. These people seemed to possess\r\nthe most astonishing memories, and the color, breeding and age of a\r\nfilly they had not seen nor heard of for a quarter of a century all came\r\nback to them with as much freshness as though the events had occurred\r\nyesterday. Then there was a peculiar element in their memories, for they\r\ncould recall everything about this one filly and nothing about any of the\r\nothers. At last Mr. Gould reached Mr. Brodhead, of Kentucky, where the\r\n“finishing touches” were put upon the pedigree of Waxy. Mr. Satterwhite\r\ndid not reach Woodburn till after Mr. Gould had left, but that did not\r\nprevent him from making a “statement” that exactly fitted the theory\r\nof the pedigree as matured by Mr. Gould and Mr. Brodhead. He had been\r\nMr. Philip Swigert’s foreman in 1864, and had a right to know something\r\nof the transfer of some eight or ten head of stock from Mr. Swigert to\r\nMr. Welch in the spring of that year. Satterwhite was quite too good a\r\nwitness, as he disclosed his cramming frightfully. He remembered “the\r\nlight chestnut filly, by Lexington and out of the Grey Eagle mare,” with\r\ngreat distinctness and was sure she was foaled in 1863. In no single case\r\nwas he certain except in the filly by Lexington, and in no single case\r\nwas he able to give the ages of the other young things correctly. After\r\nSatterwhite made his visit to Woodburn, Mr. Brodhead wrote Mr. Gould as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “Satterwhite says Dick Jackson was with Welch. I think, with\r\n    what you have, the pedigree of Waxy is conclusively proved, and\r\n    you can get your article ready. The sooner it is published the\r\n    better. I forwarded some letters to you, and I hope they gave\r\n    you additional information.”\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Mr. Gould started out on the assumption that,\r\nas there was but one animal in the inventory by Lexington and that was\r\na bay colt of 1863, that “colt,” he argued, was a typographical error,\r\nand instead of “bay colt” it should read “sorrel filly.” On this very\r\nuncertain basis he worked throughout. On this basis he collected all his\r\nfutile statements. On this basis, and to lend a helping hand, Satterwhite\r\ntestified; and on this basis Brodhead wrote, “With what you have, the\r\npedigree of Waxy is conclusively proved.” Now that Mr. Brodhead is\r\nsatisfied and that Mr. Bruce promptly entered Waxy in his Stud Book as by\r\nLexington and out of the Grey Eagle mare, we must drop the whimsical idea\r\nof the “typographical error” and consider whether the bay colt of 1863,\r\nby Lexington, did really become a sorrel filly of 1862 when he reached\r\nCalifornia a few months later.\r\n\r\n1. The bay colt, No. 20, of the inventory, was the only animal in the\r\nband by Lexington. He was a foal of 1863, and was a year younger than any\r\nof the others.\r\n\r\n2. In speaking of the losses, by death on the route, of some of the more\r\nnoted animals, Mr. Anderson enumerates the noted stallion Captain Beard,\r\nand a very fine yearling colt by Lexington, called Frank. Here perished\r\nthe only foal by Lexington in the band, and we may as well bury Mr.\r\nGould’s and Mr. Brodhead’s “typographical error” with him, for the colt\r\nkicked it to death before he died.\r\n\r\n3. When the band reached California there were several additions smuggled\r\ninto it as being part of the originals from Kentucky, and among these\r\nadditions was the light chestnut filly that has been since known as Waxy,\r\ngiven as a foal of 1862, and got by Lexington, dam unknown.\r\n\r\n4. As Mr. Brodhead had proved conclusively, from the records at Woodburn,\r\nthat Mr. Swigert’s Grey Eagle mare was barren in 1862, the “typographical\r\nerror” parties found themselves placed “between the devil and the deep\r\nsea.”\r\n\r\nThis outside filly that had been smuggled into the band of Kentuckians\r\nwas advertised along with them, as a foal of 1862, in the fall of 1864;\r\nshe was sold as a foal of 1862; she was entered in a sweepstake for\r\nthree-year-olds as a foal of 1862; she was exhibited at a horse show as\r\na foal of 1862; she started to run the only race she ever attempted as a\r\nfoal of 1862, and proving herself utterly worthless as a race mare, she\r\nwas given away on the spot as a foal of 1862.\r\n\r\nAs the only representative of Lexington in the band was “the yearling bay\r\ncolt Frank,” as shown by Mr. Anderson, the partner of Mr. Welch; and as\r\nthe records at Woodburn had clearly and distinctly shown that Swigert’s\r\nGrey Eagle mare was barren in 1862, the bottom was out of the conspiracy\r\nand it was abandoned. There was a little fussing about the possibility\r\nthat there might have been a mistake and that Waxy might have been a foal\r\nof 1863 after all, but it amounted to nothing more than the enfeebled\r\nsqueak of an asthmatic mouse and then all was quiet.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to the other branch of the investigation, this seems to be\r\nthe proper place to speak of the incidents of the sale and its sequences\r\nat the Fair Grounds at San Jose, January 3, 1865. There were some twelve\r\nor fifteen head, that had been previously advertised, offered at public\r\nsale, and a number of those were sold, all indeed in which this inquiry\r\nhas any interest. When the stock arrived at San Jose, there was a good\r\ndeal of confusion, and it is just possible that some of them were not\r\ncorrectly placed. The only discrepancy which I have found between Mr.\r\nWelch’s inventory and the facts is in the color of the filly No. 18, that\r\nappears in the inventory as a chestnut, but is advertised and sold as a\r\nbay. This mistake in color is not infrequent in the spring of the year\r\nbefore the old coat is shed, and I think it may be reasonably accounted\r\nfor on this ground. James L. Eoff, well known from ocean to ocean as the\r\nking of all “horse sharps,” seems to have taken a good deal of interest\r\nin assorting the animals and in picking up scraps of information from\r\nthe boys who had come with them. At the same time he was an excellent\r\njudge of racing stock, and as silent as the grave to the victims whom\r\nhe sought to mislead and then beat. In this way he soon knew more about\r\nthe breeding of the animals than those in charge of them. Mr. William\r\nWoodward seems to have been his friend (?) with plenty of money, but a\r\nperfect “tenderfoot” in the mysteries of the race horse. No doubt he\r\npointed out to Mr. Woodward the so-called Lexington filly and advised\r\nhim to buy her, assuring him that he wanted her himself, but if he\r\nwanted to take a little fly in racing he would not bid against him. The\r\nsale came off, and Eoff ran up the Revenue filly, out of Sally Morgan,\r\nto three hundred and twenty-five dollars and got her, it is said, for\r\nTheodore Winters. When they came to the filly by Bob Johnson, out of\r\nthe mare by Brawner’s Eclipse, Eoff bought her at two hundred and fifty\r\ndollars for himself, and named her Lilly Hitchcock. The next animal sold\r\nwas the filly by Lexington, dam unknown, and she was bought by William\r\nWoodward at two hundred and fifty dollars, and he named her Waxy. The\r\nsale was slimly attended and much of the stock was bid in for the owner,\r\nMr. John Anderson. That night the wine flowed very freely, as it was\r\nthe initiation of the “tenderfoot,” Mr. Woodward, into the ranks of\r\nrunning-horse men. After they all “got hot” (except Eoff), a sweepstakes\r\nwas opened for the three fillies, Ada C. (the Revenue filly), Lilly\r\nHitchcock and Waxy, at two hundred and fifty dollars each, and Eoff was\r\ncareful to see that it was made “play or pay.” The race was a dash of\r\na mile and a quarter, and it took place nearly twelve months after the\r\nmatch was made. Eoff won easily with Lilly Hitchcock, and Waxy was so\r\nbadly beaten that Woodward gave her away on the spot and “swore off”\r\never owning another running horse. Thus Eoff’s cunning carried his plot\r\nthrough, without a break at any point. From the hour he bought this filly\r\nhe stoutly maintained she was by Lexington and out of the Brawner’s\r\nEclipse mare. She ran all her races under this pedigree and never was\r\nchallenged, and if ever there was a mare in California bred in this way,\r\nthis is likely to be the mare. We can understand just how he could have\r\ndiscovered where Waxy came from, and that she never saw Kentucky, and on\r\nthis knowledge he based the game he played on poor Woodward.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure to establish the claim that Waxy came out of Philip\r\nSwigert’s Grey Eagle mare and publicly confessing that the evidence upon\r\nwhich Mr. Gould and Mr. Brodhead based their conclusions was fallacious\r\nand the conclusions themselves incorrect, the advocates of “more running\r\nblood in the trotter” pulled themselves together for another bout. What\r\npurported to be an old document was dug up somewhere—indeed I am told\r\nthere were two of them dug up, one in Kentucky and the other somewhere\r\non the Pacific coast—purporting to be duplicates of an agreement entered\r\ninto, in March, 1864, between John P. Welch, of California and Philip\r\nSwigert, of Kentucky, by which Welch agreed to take certain blood horses\r\nto California and sell or breed them on the shares, etc. This document\r\npossessed all the paraphernalia of authenticity, with government stamp,\r\nwitnesses to the signatures of the contracting parties, etc. This\r\ndocument (I don’t know which “duplicate”) was shown to me in April, 1891,\r\nand at the first glance, and without reading a word except the date, it\r\nastounded me. There was a paper purporting to be twenty-seven years old,\r\nand it looked as bright and fresh as though it had been written within\r\ntwenty-seven hours. There was no fading of the luster of the ink and\r\nthere was no ageing in the color of the paper. Having devoted a great\r\ndeal of time to the examination of writings, varying in age from one day\r\nto a hundred years and more, and this experience extending through many\r\nyears, I ought to be a fairly competent judge of the effects of age on\r\nink and paper. Here was a paper purporting to be over a quarter of a\r\ncentury old with all the newness of yesterday, and when Mr. J. C. Simpson\r\nshowed it to me I was impressed with the belief, on this one point of\r\nevidence alone, that it was spurious, and that Mr. Simpson had been made\r\na victim by some rascally scrivener. With so much for the appearance of\r\nthe paper, on its face, we will now examine the contents and see whether\r\nany evidence can there be found that will throw further light on the\r\nquestion of its authenticity. Unfortunately I have not what purports to\r\nbe the original of this document before me, and I must therefore depend\r\nupon my memory and upon what Judge Halsey, as attorney for Mr. Brodhead,\r\nhas printed as the contents. In giving the list of animals I will follow\r\nthe order of the “document” and place before each one, for convenience\r\nof reference, the number attached to that animal in Mr. Welch’s original\r\ninventory.\r\n\r\n  15. One gray mare, by Grey Eagle, out of Mary Morris.\r\n  16. One sorrel mare, Hope, by Glencoe.\r\n  17. Sovereign filly, out of Grey Eagle mare, four years old.\r\n   8. Vandal filly, out of bay Grey Eagle mare, four years old.\r\n  18. One two-year-old filly, by Bob Johnson, out of bay Grey Eagle mare.\r\n  19. One two-year-old filly by Lexington.\r\n  20. One yearling colt, by Lexington, out of Grey Eagle mare.\r\n  21. One two-year-old filly, by Ringgold, out of Hope.\r\n\r\nIn looking over this list there are several points suggested for remark\r\nand they all have a bearing, more or less direct, on the question at\r\nissue. The list seems to have been prepared, if prepared by Mr. Swigert,\r\nvery hurriedly and without sufficient regard to completeness or accuracy.\r\nHe started off, possibly to make a careful list, as he gave the color\r\nof the two-year-old mares at the head and then dropped all purpose of\r\ncompleteness and gave no colors nor descriptions to those that followed.\r\nHe gives No. 21 as a filly when it was a colt, and so appears in the\r\ninventory, was sold as a colt with pedigree at San Jose, January, 1865,\r\nand again, with the same pedigree, at The Willows, February, 1866. Under\r\nordinary conditions the statement of the breeder should be conclusive\r\nagainst all others, but in this case the evident hurry and absence of\r\ndescriptions have destroyed the value of the whole list, in great degree,\r\nas evidence that could be accepted with safety. We must, therefore, look\r\nfor something in the way of evidence more deliberative and descriptive\r\nin its preparation, and this we find in the joint work of Mr. Swigert\r\nand Mr. Welch, as embodied in the inventory. When the descriptions of\r\nthe animals were taken, both men were equally interested in accuracy and\r\ncompleteness, both were present, and probably the animals were before\r\nthem. Hence my infinitely greater confidence in the deliberative work of\r\nthe two, as found in the inventory.\r\n\r\nThe one point about which all this hubbub has been raised is the\r\nso-called “Lexington filly,” that appears as the sixth in the above\r\nlist. She has no number attached to her name, and this means that she\r\nwas not in the inventory, and it means more than this; for it is, in a\r\nmanner, the dying testimony of an honest man that he took no Lexington\r\nfilly to California, and fortunately this testimony has been preserved.\r\nThe methods introduced to prove that Welch did take her are the methods\r\nof the imbecile. Let us admit, for the moment, that Swigert had a\r\nLexington filly and that she was in a contract with Welch to be taken to\r\nCalifornia; does that prove that Welch took her, when he says he did not?\r\nThere are hundreds and hundreds of people every year who buy steamship\r\ntickets to go to Europe who fail to go. The records of Mr. Swigert’s\r\nticket office show that the ticket was bought, but they fail to show\r\nthat the purchaser went aboard the ship. You must go to Purser Welch and\r\nget a list of passengers actually on board in order to determine who did\r\nand who did not go. Accidents, sickness and death are all factors in the\r\nmovements, of horses just as they are in the movements of human beings.\r\nIt is the observation of a long lifetime that horsemen are never so\r\nnear their best as fools as when they attempt to establish a fraudulent\r\npedigree by evidence that utterly fails to cover the case. They claim\r\nto have found a ticket that would carry Waxy to California, and whether\r\ngenuine or counterfeit they rely wholly on this ticket as evidence that\r\nshe went. The master of the vessel affirms she was not aboard his vessel,\r\nand in support of this he shows a complete list and description of the\r\npassengers numbered from one to twenty-six inclusive. This is the whole\r\nthing in a nutshell. The proof is clear and conclusive that Mr. Welch did\r\nnot take any daughter of Lexington to California. Now, will the prominent\r\nand active supporters of Waxy’s pedigree, as a daughter of Lexington,\r\ncome forward and in a manly way answer this question of five words? “_Who\r\ntook Waxy to California?_” If Welch, prove it. If anybody else, prove it.\r\nWe may be able to catch a few gulls with chaff, the first attempt, but we\r\ncan’t repeat it. If the question can be answered, it is well, and if not,\r\nhonest people will form their own conclusions that it is not sustained\r\nand is no more worthy of belief than the “Grey Eagle mare” form of the\r\nsame pedigree, which is now universally conceded to be a fiction.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN ECLIPSE.—It is not my purpose to frighten people by overthrowing\r\nlandmarks that have stood for years, but it is my purpose to tell the\r\ntruth and expose falsehood in pedigrees wherever I meet it. As a\r\nsatisfaction and guide to breeders in the future it is important to know\r\njust how the early stock were bred, although they may have belonged to\r\npast generations. A breeder never can know too much of the lines in\r\nwhich he is operating. This great horse was a good chestnut, with a star\r\nand left hind foot white. He was stout, with heavy limbs, and somewhat\r\ncoarse, and not of the best quality, but possibly better than the\r\naverage of the Durocs. He was a fraction of an inch below fifteen two.\r\nHe was foaled 1814, got by Duroc, son of imported Diomed; dam Miller’s\r\nDamsel, by imported Messenger; grandam a mare by Pot8os, imported by Mr.\r\nConstable along with the horse Baronet, in 1795. This is just as far as\r\nwe can go with any certainty, and this leaves the greatest race horse of\r\nhis day far short of being thoroughbred. When Mr. Constable bought the\r\nPot8os mare in England he got no certificate of pedigree, but he was told\r\nthere she was out of a mare by Gimcrack. Mr. Cadwallader R. Colden was\r\nthe best-informed man of his day on the history, blood, and performances\r\nof the blood-horse, was a very intimate and warm friend of Mr. Constable,\r\nand he did everything that could be done to straighten out and extend\r\nthis pedigree, but he utterly failed. He thought it probable that the\r\nmare was thoroughbred, but he believed the Gimcrack cross was a fiction.\r\nSome eighteen or twenty years ago, when in London, Mr. Tattersall\r\nsuggested to me that if Lord Grosvenor bred a filly by Pot8os in 1792\r\nthat was thoroughbred, there could hardly be a doubt that she was entered\r\nin some of the stakes for three-year-olds. Then and there we searched the\r\nold records, but nothing could be found to support the supposed pedigree.\r\nIt was not till 1832 that any special effort was made to establish the\r\npedigree through the press, and in January of that year the famous\r\nPatrick Nesbit Edgar, of North Carolina, wrote as follows to Mr. Skinner,\r\neditor of the _American Turf Register_:\r\n\r\n    “The authority I had for sending the remote pedigree of\r\n    American Eclipse for publication was that it was furnished me\r\n    lately by a gentleman in England, who put himself to uncommon\r\n    pains to procure it. He resides near Bath, in that country. All\r\n    the authority requisite I have at this time in my possession.\r\n    The Pot8os mare was got by Pot8os; her dam, foaled in 1778, by\r\n    Gimcrack, out of Snap-Dragon, sister to Angelica by Snap. (See\r\n    English Stud Book.)”\r\n\r\nMr. Edgar wrote more on the same subject, after he was pressed to it by\r\nMr. Colden, but he failed to produce any evidence whatever that he was\r\ntelling the truth. According to his representations his correspondence on\r\nthe subject had been very extensive, and he complained that he had paid\r\nout forty shillings in postage.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed how cleverly Mr. Edgar conceals the sources of\r\nhis information while he pretends to give them, and that has been the\r\nfavorite “dodge” of all rascally “pedigree makers” from that day till\r\nthe present. Mr. Constable always insisted that the mare was bred by\r\nLord Grosvenor, and that she was by Pot8os, but he did not insist that\r\nshe was out of a mare by Gimcrack. As Lord Grosvenor was one of the\r\nmost prominent of all breeders of race horses in his day, and as he\r\nevidently kept the records of his stud with more care than most of his\r\ncontemporaries, we might reasonably expect to find some trace of this\r\nmare if she was thoroughbred. After a careful and diligent search of all\r\nthe records of that period, it is found that Lord Grosvenor never bred a\r\nGimcrack filly to Pot8os. This disposes of Mr. Edgar’s humbug story, and\r\nwhen we state the pedigree of American Eclipse we can simply say he was\r\ngot by Duroc; dam Miller’s Damsel by Messenger, and grandam the imported\r\nPot8os mare, and there we must stop.\r\n\r\nFor years past I have observed that the less a man knows about horse\r\nhistory and horse achievements, the more importance he attaches to\r\nthe word “thoroughbred;” and of all the millions and millions of lies\r\nthat have been told about pedigrees nine-tenths have been concocted\r\nand circulated for the one purpose of enhancing the supposed value of\r\nthe animal by claiming “thoroughbred” blood. The “instinct” to lie\r\nabout pedigrees, so common among certain classes of horsemen, seems to\r\nbe “the sum of inherited habits” that has come down from generation\r\nto generation. If you ask one of these mendacious gentlemen whether\r\nAmerican Eclipse was a thoroughbred he will answer, with a strong marked\r\nexpression of contempt and pity for your ignorance on his countenance,\r\n“Certainly he was thoroughbred.” If you then ask him about his pedigree\r\nhe will answer, “I don’t know anything about his pedigree.” Then you\r\nventure to ask how he knows he was thoroughbred if he does not know\r\nanything about his pedigree, and he will squelch you completely by\r\nsaying, “No horse not thoroughbred could ever have done what American\r\nEclipse did.” Here we get at the real basis of the universal mendacity\r\non this subject. The preacher wrote a great book called “The Perfect\r\nHorse” in which he maintained that the Morgan Horse was thoroughbred.\r\nThe lawyer wrote another great book on “The American Roadster” in which\r\nhe maintained that Dexter was a thoroughbred. With two gentlemen of\r\nintelligence and education writing such miserable stuff, what are we to\r\nexpect from the masses?\r\n\r\nNow here is the horse American Eclipse, the greatest horse of his day\r\nin his racing achievements, that in his blood is very far from being\r\n“thoroughbred,” under any rule that has ever been suggested or devised.\r\nNow, with this taint on his escutcheon, it follows that no one of his\r\ndescendants for at least five generations can be classed as thoroughbred.\r\nAs a progenitor, Eclipse cannot be considered a great horse, either in\r\nhis immediate or more remote descendants. Medoc was about his best, and\r\nhe was better than his sire. Another son, called Monmouth Eclipse, was\r\ngrandly bred on the side of his dam, was sold, it was said, for fifteen\r\nthousand dollars for stock purposes, and proved a most lamentable\r\nfailure, never having got a colt that was worth fifteen dollars as a\r\nrace horse. The great fame of American Eclipse, therefore, rested upon\r\nwhat were then designated as “his mighty achievements upon the turf.”\r\nA reasonably complete history of this horse may be found in _Wallace’s\r\nMonthly_ for March, 1877, p. 160. His great race against Henry, in which\r\nhe represented the North as against the South, was doubtless the most\r\nmemorable turf event that ever took place on this continent, and a very\r\nbrilliant description of it will be found at the reference given above.\r\nThis race of four-mile heats took place on the Union Course, Long Island,\r\nMay, 1823, for twenty thousand dollars a side, and it was, in effect,\r\nEclipse against the world. Eclipse, fit or not fit, must start, while his\r\nopponents had several prepared to start against him and all they had to\r\ndetermine was to select the fastest and best of the whole party. At the\r\nlast hour Henry was chosen as the champion of the South, and he won the\r\nfirst heat by about a length in 7:37½. A change was made in the rider\r\nof Eclipse and he won the second heat by about two lengths in 7:49. In\r\nthe third heat the instructions to the rider of Henry were not to hurry\r\nthe gait, but to trail to near the finish and then pull out and win in\r\na rush. The rider of Eclipse understood the tactics of the enemy and he\r\nhurried the pace every step of the way, in order to tire out his younger\r\nopponent. When near the finish Henry made his dash and covered Eclipse’s\r\nquarter with his head, but he could get no further and abandoned the\r\ncontest. Eclipse had been punished unmercifully from start to finish, and\r\nthe time of the heat was 8:24. This shows an average rate of speed in the\r\nthird heat of two minutes and six seconds to the mile, a rate which half\r\na dozen trotters and a round dozen of pacers have beaten for a single\r\nmile. It shows also the cruelty, to say nothing of the absurdity, of heat\r\nracing at the distance of four miles. Still American Eclipse was the\r\ngreatest running horse of his generation.\r\n\r\nBOSTON was a chestnut horse, foaled 1833, and bred by Mr. John Wickham,\r\nthe very eminent jurist, of Richmond, Virginia. He succeeded to the\r\ngreat fame of American Eclipse, and although about two generations, in\r\na racing sense, after him there was no horse between them that was the\r\nequal of either of them. He was a terror to all competitors whether of\r\nthe North or the South. But it is only my purpose here to put on record\r\nthe real facts about his pedigree and to expose a glaring fraud that has\r\nbeen propagated concerning his breeding for many years. Mr. Wickham, the\r\nbreeder of Boston, bought a mare by imported Alderman (1802 or 1803) from\r\nJohn Randolph, of Tuckahoe (not “Roanoke” as sometimes stated). This mare\r\nwas out of a mare by imported Clockfast, and here, to sum it up and give\r\nMr. Wickham’s exact language, as he wrote in 1827: “This mare, a dark\r\nbay, foaled about 1799, was got by Alderman, her dam by Clockfast, out\r\nof a mare said to be full-blooded, of the Wildair blood.” This Alderman\r\nmare he bred to Florizel, and she produced the race horse Tuckahoe, and\r\na filly that was bred to Timoleon and produced Boston. Then Boston’s\r\npedigree stands; Got by Timoleon; dam by Florizel; grandam by imported\r\nAlderman; great-grandam by imported Clockfast; great-great-grandam “said\r\nto be of the Wildair blood.” This is down to “hard pan,” and there is\r\nno authority in the wide world to add anything to it. If we admit the\r\nWildair mare to be genuine and authentic we are still one degree short\r\nof the thoroughbred standard. The six additional crosses that have been\r\nadded to this pedigree are entirely fictitious. They were copied from the\r\nadvertisement of a stallion descended from this maternal line, that had\r\nneither indorsement nor name attached to it. This was seized upon by the\r\nlate Benjamin Bruce, and boasted of as a “discovery” of the extension\r\nof Boston’s pedigree. After the appearance of this advertisement Mr.\r\nWickham prepared and published a full list of his stock, with their\r\npedigrees, from the first of his breeding operations, and when he\r\nreached the Wildair mare he stopped, just as I have stopped at that\r\npoint. Here we have the two authorities—Mr. John Wickham, distinguished\r\nfor his eminent character as a man and a jurist; or a nameless stallion\r\nadvertisement without any shadow of truth or responsibility.\r\n\r\nTimoleon, the sire of Boston, was one of the most distinguished sons of\r\nthe great Sir Archy, his dam was by imported Saltram, and his grandam by\r\nWildair, but beyond that the pedigree is a hopeless muddle, embracing\r\nsome features that are absolutely impossible.\r\n\r\nTOM BOWLING AND AARON PENNINGTON.—The first of these horses was by\r\nLexington, the second was by Tipperary, son of Ringgold, and they\r\nwere both out of Lucy Fowler, by imported Albion, grandam-by imported\r\nLeviathan, great-grandam by Top Gallant, great-great-grandam Eli Odom’s\r\nsaddle mare, which means, in that country, she was a pacer. Tom Bowling\r\nwas probably the best race horse of his year, and Pennington may be\r\nclassed as mediocre, but as the latter is credited with some pacers or\r\ntrotters that have come within the 2:30 list, his pedigree becomes of\r\ninterest on this account. I will, therefore, give the facts in some\r\ndetail, which go to show the truth about what the pedigree contains and\r\nwhat it does not contain.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 the late William R. Elliston, of Nashville, Tennessee, furnished\r\nme the following facts, which he obtained personally from Mr. Eli Odom.\r\nIt was very fortunate that Mr. Elliston obtained these facts when he\r\ndid, for Mr. Odom was advanced in years and died not long afterward.\r\nHe was a brother-in-law of the once very famous breeder and race horse\r\nman, Colonel Elliott, of Tennessee, and in early life had charge of his\r\nestablishment and knew more about Colonel Elliott’s stock than he did\r\nhimself. He lived to old age, highly respected by all who knew him, and\r\nwas a man of truth. He kept for his own use a pacing saddle mare whose\r\nblood he knew nothing about, and he bred her to Top Gallant, son of\r\nGallatin, and the produce was a filly. This filly he bred to imported\r\nLeviathan, and in due time there came another filly which he bred to\r\nimported Albion, and the next filly was Lucy Fowler. This filly passed\r\nthrough the hands of a Mr. Fowler and perhaps one or two others, and at\r\nlast became the property of Price McGrath, of Lexington, Kentucky, and\r\nwas the dam of Tom Bowling, Aaron Pennington and others. Starting in\r\nwith the pacing mare, Mr. Odom bred all that followed until we reach\r\nLucy Fowler, and there we find she had seven parts of running blood and\r\none part of pacing blood. While an animal bred in this way is certainly\r\nnot “thoroughbred,” nobody can deny that he is “running-bred,” for\r\nthere are hundreds of instances on record where animals of even shorter\r\npedigrees than Tom Bowling have been noted race horses. But there is\r\nanother fact connected with this family that is very interesting. When\r\nthe running qualities of Pennington were exhausted, McGrath presented\r\nhim to a kinsman of his, somewhere in Western Missouri. After awhile I\r\nbegan to hear of an occasional trotter from this horse and I wrote his\r\nowner (whose name I cannot now recall), and he replied that “he went all\r\nthe saddle gaits and was a pacer.” Here was a tidbit that I thought well\r\nworth looking after, and I wrote the owner again for specific information\r\nof the character of his pace and whether it was a clean and pronounced\r\nside action, but for some reason or other I never was able to get a reply\r\nto my questions. There can be no mistake about his going the “saddle\r\ngaits,” but whether this was the result of training or whether he took to\r\nthem naturally as inherited from Mr. Odom’s old pacing mare, is a point\r\nabout which I have never been fully satisfied.\r\n\r\nGREY EAGLE (CHENERY’S).—When Mr. Winthrop W. Chenery, of Boston, bought\r\nthis horse, about 1866, he got with him the following pedigree.\r\n\r\n    “Got by Grey Eagle; dam by imp. Trustee; g. d. by Columbus; g.\r\n    g. d. by Stockholder; g. g. g. d. by Pacolet. Bred in Kentucky,\r\n    and passed through many vicissitudes, both as a runner and a\r\n    trotter, beating his competitors at both gaits; owned for a\r\n    time in Ohio, now the property of Winthrop W. Chenery & Co.,\r\n    Boston.”\r\n\r\nThis was a correct type of the pedigrees of that time, lacking date,\r\nlocation, breeder and all other things necessary to trace and determine\r\nits value. The horse had certainly trotted in 2:31, and he had trotted\r\ntwo miles to wagon in 5:09½, and to this evidence of his trotting ability\r\nit was claimed that he had run and won many races at all distances. This\r\nwas such a combination of abilities as I never had heard of before, and\r\nin attempting to solve the riddle I became deeply interested. The search\r\nthen instituted has been kept up ever since, and I must say that after\r\nall these years I know absolutely nothing about the breeding of this\r\nhorse. His first known owner was a petty gambler and general outlaw in\r\nthe neighborhood of Portsmouth, Ohio, and the story he told will be found\r\nin _Wallace’s Monthly_, Vol. I., p. 53, and Vol. VII., p. 597, besides\r\nother references. The search has been so barren that I have not even the\r\nshadow of a theory as to what his blood may have been. He got two or\r\nthree trotters and one or two pacers, I think, and here we have to leave\r\nhim as the most completely unknown horse in all my experience.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WILKES.—It is a grievous misfortune that the pedigree of this\r\ngreat progenitor should be in doubt. The misfortune is not in the fact\r\nthat his descendants lose the supposed Clay cross in his dam, for that\r\nwas not of very great value, but in the fact that we should not know just\r\nwhat belongs in its place. In December, 1877, I had the good fortune to\r\nmeet with Mr. Harry Felter and Mr. William L. Simmons at a breeders’\r\nbanquet, and it was not long until we were in conversation about the\r\nblood of the dam of George Wilkes. I knew that the breeding of that horse\r\nhad never been established, but I was greatly surprised that these two\r\ngentlemen—one the breeder and the other the owner of Wilkes—had never\r\nmade any effort to trace and establish so important a fact. Mr. Felter\r\nstated that he had bought the mare from Mr. W. A. Delevan, and that Mr.\r\nDelevan had bought her from Mr. Joseph S. Lewis, of Geneva, New York.\r\nThereupon I wrote to Mr. Lewis and the following is his response:\r\n\r\n    “Some twenty-six years since I bought a brown mare from a\r\n    gentleman by the name of James Gilbert, then living in the town\r\n    of Phelps, in this county, for a friend, and very soon after\r\n    sold her to W. A. Delevan, of New York. She was then about five\r\n    years old, a fine roadster, and could speed in about 3:30. He\r\n    took her to New York, and after driving her some time sold\r\n    her to my esteemed friend, Harry Felter. I think she passed\r\n    into the hands of his father, and met with an accident. She\r\n    was put to breeding, and had a colt by Rysdyk’s Hambletonian,\r\n    that grew up to be the famous George Wilkes. For the benefit\r\n    of many persons in New York I lost no time in looking about to\r\n    learn the pedigree of the mare and of the horse that got her.\r\n    On seeing Gilbert I learned that he got the mare of an old man\r\n    who is now dead, by the name of Josiah Philips, of Bristol,\r\n    in this county. I lost no time in sending a man, who lived\r\n    with us at the time, by the name of John S. Dey, to Bristol,\r\n    to get all the facts in the mare’s pedigree that he could get\r\n    hold of. He learned through Philips that the father of this\r\n    mare was the old Wadsworth Henry Clay, owned for many years by\r\n    General Wadsworth, of Genesee. There is no mistake about this,\r\n    as I have since learned from his neighbors that she was a Clay\r\n    colt. Philips further stated that the mother of the mare was\r\n    got by a horse called Highlander, a good horse, and owned in\r\n    that section of country. I have no doubt about this, as there\r\n    was such a horse in that section about that time. When I go\r\n    to Buffalo, where Gilbert now lives, I may be able to get at\r\n    more facts in regard to your inquiry, and if I can get hold of\r\n    anything that will give more light on the subject before I am\r\n    down in New York, I will drop into your office to see you.\r\n\r\n                      Very truly yours, etc.\r\n\r\n                                                     “J. S. LEWIS.”\r\n\r\nThe receipt of this letter, so straightforward and clean-cut in its\r\nstatements, developed a mystery that was incomprehensible to me. Dates,\r\nnames, places, circumstances, all stand out as evidences of the truth\r\nof the representations, and also as evidences that Mr. Lewis had fully\r\ninvestigated the matter, and given the results of his investigations\r\nto his friends in this city; still, those friends had never heard the\r\nfacts, or had entirely forgotten them. As there was a strong prejudice\r\nagainst Clay blood in certain quarters, it occurred to me that possibly\r\nthat cross had been left in abeyance so long that it really had been\r\nforgotten. This did not clear up the mystery, however, and I determined\r\nto have the whole matter investigated from a different starting point. I\r\nsubmitted the matter to Mr. John P. Ray, a very capable and very honest\r\nman, and he kindly and without reward undertook the investigation. The\r\nPhilips family lived in the vicinity of Bristol, and the first of the\r\nfamily met by Mr. Ray was Mr. E. V. Philips, nephew and adopted son of\r\nJoshua Philips (not Josiah, as Mr. Lewis had it), and he enumerated\r\nseveral head of Clays that had been owned by his uncle Joshua, among them\r\na mare that was bred by Mr. Clark Philips, bought of him when a yearling\r\nby E. V. Philips, sold as a four-year-old to his uncle Joshua, and by him\r\nthe next year to “some man from the eastern part of the country.” He next\r\nmet Mr. Clark Philips, who fully confirmed E. V. Philips about the Clay\r\nfilly already referred to and said she was got when old Henry Clay was\r\nowned by Kent and Bailey of Bristol, and that her dam was “Old Telegraph”\r\nby Highlander, etc. In his original report to me of his investigation Mr.\r\nRay uses the following language:\r\n\r\n    “When Henry Clay was being brought from the East to his home in\r\n    Western New York, he stopped one night at the hotel then kept\r\n    in Bristol by Dr. Durgan, deceased (the breeder of Castle Boy),\r\n    and made a season at this place the following year, when he\r\n    became the property of Kent & Bailey. He was kept in that town\r\n    for several years, etc.”\r\n\r\nNow, as between the original and voluntary statement of Captain Lewis\r\nand the investigation carried through by Mr. Ray, there is no conflict\r\nand all is smooth sailing, and upon the information derived from these\r\ntwo sources the pedigree of George Wilkes was decided as established\r\nby the Board of Censors. But more recent discoveries made by Mr. Ray,\r\nin which I have no doubt he is thoroughly conscientious and possibly\r\nthoroughly right, have raised a conflict that is irrepressible, for dates\r\nare involved and insisted upon that make the pedigree impossible. In his\r\noriginal statement Mr. Ray says that Henry Clay made the season of 1846\r\nat Bristol, “when he became the property of Kent & Bailey. He was kept in\r\nthat town for some years.” Up to this point there is no contradiction and\r\nno impossibility; Ray agrees with Lewis and Lewis agrees with Ray. But in\r\nthe past two or three years Mr. Ray believes he has secured additional\r\ninformation, and this places Captain Lewis in a very unenviable position.\r\nThe whole point of Clark Philips’ evidence is that he bred his mare “Old\r\nTelegraph” to Henry Clay when that horse was owned by Bailey Brothers,\r\nof Bristol, and I suppose they were the successors of Kent & Bailey of\r\nan earlier date. Now, as Mr. Ray told us in his first investigation that\r\nHenry Clay passed into the hands of Kent & Bailey in 1847, and as he\r\ntells us later that he did not pass into their hands till nine or ten\r\nyears after that date and then fails to fix the precise year, it must\r\nbe conceded by all that his information is not wholly satisfactory.\r\nRecollections may be ever so honest, but they are of various degrees\r\nof reliability. The best and final evidence is the service book of the\r\nhorse. My best judgment of the whole matter is that Mr. Ray’s later\r\ninformation is probably correct, but until all doubt is removed by the\r\nproduction of some contemporaneous record covering the case there must\r\nremain an element of uncertainty attaching to the pedigree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nHOW THE TROTTING HORSE IS BRED.\r\n\r\n    Early trotting and pacing races—Strains of blood in the\r\n    first known trotters —The lesson of Maud S.—The genesis of\r\n    trotting-horse literature—The simple study of inheritance—The\r\n    different forms of heredity—The famous quagga story not\r\n    sustained—Illustrations in dogs—Heredity of acquired characters\r\n    and instincts—Development of successive generations necessary\r\n    —Unequaled collections of statistics—Acquired injuries and\r\n    unsoundness transmitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs preparatory to taking up the consideration of the breeding problem,\r\nit may be well to look back a little and see what had transpired in the\r\ntrotting-horse world, leading up to the serious consideration of how\r\nhe was bred. It has been generally accepted as true that there were no\r\ntrotting contests in this country till about the second decade of the\r\npresent century, but this impression has grown out of the fact that the\r\nnewspapers, down to that period, failed to report such contests. It\r\nis historically true that pacing races were a common amusement among\r\nthe people of different portions of the colonies nearly two hundred\r\nyears ago. This is established by the legislative action of some of\r\nthe colonies, in the first half of the last century, in suppressing\r\nall “pacing and trotting races.” It is well to note, in passing, that\r\npacers and trotters of that early period were commingled, just as they\r\nare to-day, with the former the more prominent, and the more highly\r\nprized. Of that hundred years of silence we have no details and but few\r\nhistorical references that were contemporaneous with the events. Hence we\r\nare practically dependent upon the legislative action of the colonies to\r\nestablish the truth beyond question.\r\n\r\nWhen we reach the period when the newspapers began to report some of the\r\nmore conspicuous and important trotting events about Philadelphia and New\r\nYork, we find a condition of things for which we are hardly prepared. The\r\npacer has lost his prominence and is but little in evidence, and all the\r\nbest trotters seem to be descended from the imported horse Messenger.\r\nThe best performers of that period were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Topgallant\r\n  Paul Pry\r\n  Dutchman\r\n  Jersey Fagdown\r\n  Commander (Bull)\r\n  Gipsy\r\n  Bull Calf\r\n  Lady Warrenton\r\n  Betsy Baker\r\n  Sir Peter\r\n  Screwdriver\r\n  Chancellor\r\n  Whalebone\r\n  Lady Suffolk\r\n  Andrew Jackson\r\n  Fanny Pullen\r\n  Washington\r\n  Sally Miller\r\n  Greenwich Maid\r\n  Charlotte Temple\r\n  Confidence\r\n  Rattler\r\n  Lady Salisbury\r\n  Modesty\r\n\r\nThese were all descended from Messenger, and with the exception of Edwin\r\nForrest and one or two others, believed to be descended from pacing\r\nblood, they were the leading performers of their day. All of the above\r\nanimals were not equally strong in Messenger blood as three of them\r\nwere by sons and out of daughters of Messenger, five were by sons of\r\nMessenger, and all the others had more or less of his blood. More than\r\neighty years ago the descendants of Messenger, wherever known, were\r\nrecognized as a family of trotters and this broad fact became a kind\r\nof universal belief among horsemen. This belief, being founded on a\r\ntruth, was all right, but a plausible deduction from it, which was not\r\na truth, inflicted a terrible penalty upon the pockets of otherwise\r\nintelligent men for a period of more than fifty years before they\r\ndiscovered their error. The postulate was in this form: “Messenger was\r\na thoroughbred horse and founded a great family of trotters, hence,\r\nany other thoroughbred horse, under the same conditions, would have\r\naccomplished the same results.” This “stock” form of the argument was\r\nplausible and it was in everybody’s mouth from one end of the land to\r\nthe other. Every stable boy, every breeder, every editor believed the\r\ndeduction was sound, and, I may as well own it, I believed it myself\r\nuntil I had gathered together all the accessible trotting statistics of\r\nthis country and reduced them to order and method, so that they might be\r\nstudied and their true teachings be drawn from them. As an illustration\r\nof the ignorant intolerance and dishonesty with which certain editors and\r\ntheir followers maintained, less than twenty years ago, that all that\r\nwas of any value in the trotter was inherited from the runner, take the\r\nfollowing: In the autumn of 1878 the famous Maud S., then four years old,\r\ncame out and trotted a mile in 2:17½, which was then a world’s wonder.\r\nShe was a pacer of the plastic type, but she had to wear toe-weights\r\nthrough all her brilliant career to keep her on her gait as a trotter.\r\nEverybody was astounded at this phenomenal performance and went wild over\r\nit as something that had never been done before, by a four-year-old,\r\nand probably never would be done again. On this performance I simply\r\nremarked, in the _Monthly_:\r\n\r\n    “Her trotting inheritance is very strong and well defined on\r\n    both sides of the house, and she has a right to trot, and trot\r\n    fast, and her 2:17½ shows that she trots instinctively, and\r\n    without much training; and in this she is phenomenal. She is\r\n    simply a little in advance of her time; for no truth is more\r\n    fully sustained by analogy and reason than that, in a few\r\n    generation of judicious selections, such mares will not be\r\n    phenomenal.”\r\n\r\nFrom this four-year-old record of 2:17½ in 1878, we pass on to the\r\ntwo-year-old record of 2:10¾ in 1891. A four-year-old now trotting\r\nin 2:17½ is only commonplace. It was not a gift of “prophecy” nor an\r\noverwrought enthusiasm, therefore, that enabled me to determine that\r\n2:17½ for a four-year-old would become commonplace, but a study of the\r\nlaws of breeding in the light of all past trotting experiences. When\r\nthis performance was made the late B. G. Bruce, of Lexington, Kentucky,\r\nthen editor of a sporting paper, went into ecstasies over it and was at\r\nonce able to show, to his own mind, that it was all owing to the running\r\nblood in Maud S. that enabled her to show phenomenal speed. He figured\r\nthis all out and showed that she possessed eleven-sixteenths of what he\r\ncalled “pure blood,” to five-sixteenths of what he called “cold blood.”\r\nIn winding up his article, he says:\r\n\r\n    “In conclusion we deem it evident from her form and action that\r\n    the great power of Maud S. comes from her pure blood; that her\r\n    breeding back on the form and action, courage and endurance\r\n    of the blood horse is the very reason why she is so superior\r\n    to all four-year-olds that have ever appeared. And another\r\n    point is obvious: the pure blood matures so much earlier than\r\n    the cold blood that years are gained in development over the\r\n    cold-blooded trotter.”\r\n\r\nNow instead of Maud S. possessing eleven-sixteenths of “pure blood,” as\r\nclaimed by Mr. Bruce, it has never been shown and never can be shown that\r\nshe possessed one single drop of “pure blood.” When Sally Russell, the\r\ngrandam of Maud S., was sold to Mr. R. A. Alexander, she was sold under\r\na fraudulent pedigree, and when Pilot Jr. was sold to Mr. Alexander an\r\nutterly impossible pedigree was manufactured for him. In both cases he\r\nwas the victim of sharpers, for in his life and character he stood away\r\nabove all suspicion. The pedigrees of Pilot Jr. and Sally Russell have\r\nbeen fully considered in Chapter XXIX. of this volume.\r\n\r\nAfter publishing “The American Stud Book” in 1867, and the first volume\r\nof the “Trotting Register” in 1871, and having carefully compiled all\r\npast trotting races and trotting experiences, up to the close of 1872,\r\nit began to dawn upon me that possibly I had been handling a great many\r\nfictions and thereby given them an indorsement to the world as truths.\r\nThis “gave me pause,” as well as many a sleepless night and anxious day.\r\nThe old adage, “What everybody says must be true,” gave me no comfort,\r\nfor I had just found that Mr. “Everybody” was a great liar. Then a higher\r\nand purer maxim suggested itself to my mind, “One, with the truth on his\r\nside, is a majority,” and under this banner I enlisted for the war which\r\nI knew was coming. Having compiled the pedigrees of all running horses\r\nand all trotting horses, so far as known, up to 1870, and more especially\r\nhaving gathered up all past trotting experiences and statistics, I felt\r\nthat I was equipped to enter the lists with everybody against me. I knew\r\nI was liable to meet antagonists on every side, and some of them of\r\ngreat ability, but at the same time I knew they had neither the armor\r\nof truth nor the weapons of facts at their command. Mere prejudices and\r\nthe limping opinions that spring from them have no force in an earnest\r\ncombat. The platform upon which I stood was aggressive, but simple and\r\neasily comprehended, viz., “The English horse Messenger, in his own right\r\nand by his own power, founded a family of trotters—something which no\r\nother English horse had ever been able to take the first step toward\r\naccomplishing.” This was the central point around which the battle\r\nraged, and to it I added the pacer as a subsidiary or minor source of\r\nspeed, equally certain in fact, but not equally well defined in lines\r\nof descent, nor equally important in numbers and value. From these\r\nmajor and minor sources it is literally true that all our trotters have\r\ndescended. In confirmation of this, a very capable and careful writer in\r\nthe New York _Sun_, within the past few months, has said: “Hambletonian\r\nis the progenitor of ninety per cent. of the fast trotters now on the\r\nturf.” When we start with Hambletonian, the triple great-grandson of\r\nMessenger, we are safely within the period of records of both blood and\r\nperformances, and we are relieved from some possible uncertainties in\r\nthe earlier period of Messenger himself, hence the writer quoted above\r\nis at bed-rock in the sources of his information. This makes my major\r\nproposition so plain and so triumphantly sustained that it is doubtful\r\nwhether there is now living an intelligent horseman who would even think\r\nof disputing it.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1872 I wrote a series of articles under the caption\r\nof “How shall we breed the Trotting Horse?” which was published in the\r\n_Spirit of the Times_ in February and March of that year. These papers\r\nwere revised and enlarged and published, as an introductory treatise on\r\nbreeding the trotter, in the second volume of the “American Trotting\r\nRegister.” This treatise is the genesis of all discussions in which the\r\nlaws governing the breeding of the trotter are considered. Up to that\r\nperiod contributions to the press on breeding subjects were generally\r\ntransient and confined to the writer’s own experience. If he was trying\r\nto breed trotters a comparison of his material always corresponded with\r\nhis arguments, and the only thing he demonstrated was his own inability\r\nto see over the fence surrounding his own paddocks. I love a man who\r\nloves his horse, and, as a man, I cannot dislike him because he thinks\r\nhis horse is the very acme of all equine perfection, although he may be\r\na worthless, brute; but when a man spends a whole lifetime in trying to\r\nbreed trotters from blood that cannot trot, I lose all respect for his\r\nmental operations. The man who cannot widen out and take profit from\r\nthe demonstrated experiences of the whole trotting world, had better\r\nturn his attention to some business suited to his capacity. Not a single\r\nthought advanced nor a position taken in the article referred to has ever\r\nbeen successfully controverted, although they excited much opposition.\r\nAn attempt was made to laugh the phrase “trotting instinct” out of\r\ncourt, but that little phrase not only held the fortress, but became,\r\nas it were, the basis of the whole system of thought represented in the\r\ntreatise. It had a meaning and a fitness in what it meant that put it in\r\neverybody’s mouth, and there it stays for all time. Instinct is “the sum\r\nof inherited habits;” and these five words express the best practical\r\ndefinition of its meaning that I have ever met with.\r\n\r\nTHE LAWS THAT GOVERN.—In all animal life the resemblance of the offspring\r\nto the parents is the universal law. The law is not only true in the\r\nphysical conformation of the offspring, but it is also true in the\r\nmentality and instinctivity of the offspring. In former years it was\r\nvery aptly termed the law of inheritance, but the more general usage is\r\nnow the law of heredity. In casting about for a definition of this newly\r\ncoined word, I have not been able to find anything more comprehensive and\r\nexpressive than that given by Ribot, in the opening sentence of his work\r\non this subject. He says:\r\n\r\n    “Heredity is that biological law by which all beings endowed\r\n    with life tend to repeat themselves in their descendants; it is\r\n    for the species what personal identity is for the individual.\r\n    By it a groundwork remains unchanged amid incessant variation;\r\n    by it Nature ever copies and imitates herself.”\r\n\r\nThis has been the law ever since the command went forth, “Let the earth\r\nbring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle and creeping thing\r\nand beast of the earth after his kind.” Hence sprang the varieties,\r\nspecies, genera and orders into which naturalists have sought to classify\r\nthe animal kingdom. In generations long past our ancestors used such\r\nphrases as “Like father, like son,” “Trot father, trot mother, trot\r\ncolt,” “Like begets like,” etc., meaning just what we mean to-day by the\r\nword “heredity.” While heredity is a universal law of animal life, it\r\nmust be remembered that its results cannot be pre-determined by any rule\r\nof arithmetic. Every colt has a sire and a dam, four grandparents, eight\r\ngreat-grandparents, and then sixteen, and next thirty-two progenitors.\r\nHere we have five generations embracing sixty-two different animals, and\r\nthe experiences of many years have gone to show that if these sixty-two\r\nanimals are all purely bred in the breed which you are seeking to secure\r\nthere is a reasonable certainty that your prospective colt will be a\r\ngood representative of that breed. By this I mean that with this number\r\nof generations there is but little danger of your colt following some\r\nundesirable type outside of and beyond these five generations. The only\r\nway to study this problem intelligently and with satisfaction is to\r\ntabulate the pedigrees of the two animals you propose to couple and then\r\nstudy each individual of the different generations and see what each one\r\nhas done in the direction you are breeding. If you are breeding for a\r\nDerby winner you want every one of the sixty-two to have proved himself\r\nor herself a first-class runner, and you don’t want a single drop of\r\noutside blood in any of them. If you are breeding for the two-minute\r\ntrotter, you don’t want any blood but the fastest trotting blood. If you\r\nare breeding for the two-minute pacer you want nothing but the fastest\r\npacing blood. But, possibly you may be breeding for size, style, and\r\nbeauty, and in that case you must be particularly careful to have your\r\ntabulation full of animals possessing these qualifications. In times past\r\nmany breeders have been led to their own hurt in making ill-considered\r\nattempts at improvement by mating animals of antagonistic instincts. The\r\nfast runner and the fast trotter have nothing in common between them in\r\nthe way of gait. In physical structure there may be no antagonism that we\r\ncan see, but in mental or psychical structure there is nothing but what\r\nis inharmonious. Each animal and each line of blood must be considered\r\nas it stands separate from the other, and the question must be not only\r\nasked but answered: “What has this line of blood done in its own right\r\nand by its own power?”\r\n\r\nIn studying these tabulations it certainly is not necessary to remind any\r\nthinking man of the comparative value of near and remote individuals.\r\nThe first and second generations are the important factors in the\r\ncharacter and value of the proposed colt, and, as a rule, the four\r\ngrandparents are not given that weight in making up a sound judgment\r\nto which they are entitled. A tabulated pedigree may show a general\r\nequality or average goodness all over, in the direction we are looking;\r\nalthough it may embrace but few stars it is not a pedigree that should\r\nbe hastily rejected. The student should never lose sight of the truth\r\nthat bad qualities are just as certain to be transmitted as good ones.\r\nBad feet, bad limbs, bad eyes and bad respiration should be sufficient\r\ncause for prompt rejection. Derangement or unhealthiness of the internal\r\nviscera or any of them is just as likely to be transmitted as an external\r\nmalformation or disease.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the qualities sought seem to emanate entirely from the\r\nsire or the dam, and this prepotency seems to appear more frequently as\r\nthe work of the sire than of the dam, perhaps because the opportunities\r\nare greater in the number of services. Thousands of stallions have failed\r\nto get trotters out of running-bred mares, but as many as you could count\r\non the fingers of one hand, probably, have succeeded in a few instances.\r\nOf these Pilot Jr., Almont and Electioneer occur to me at this time as\r\nthe most prominent. These horses, so far as we know the lines of their\r\nblood, were strictly trotting and pacing bred, with no tincture of\r\nrunning blood in their veins. On a certain occasion Senator Stanford\r\nwished to demonstrate to the writer that Electioneer could get trotters\r\nout of running-bred mares, and after showing the step of the famous Palo\r\nAlto, he remarked: “None of my other stallions can do that. Electioneer\r\nalone has the power to get trotters out of some thoroughbred mares, but\r\nnot all.” This ability to get a trotter out of a running mare is the\r\nhighest test to which the prepotency of a trotting sire can be put, as is\r\nshown by the very small number that have ever succeeded.\r\n\r\nDIRECT HEREDITY.—While it is true that all inheritance must come through\r\nthe parents, it is also true that phenomena of form, character and\r\nquality are not infrequently presented that the parents do not seem to\r\npossess, and upon looking further we find those phenomena in some of the\r\nmore remote ancestors. When we find the character of the offspring a\r\npractical reproduction of one or both the parents, we designate this as a\r\ncase of “direct heredity” merely for the convenience of description and\r\nelucidation. Ideal or perfect heredity never has been reached and never\r\nwill be. There are two sources to the life of the new being, and each\r\nof these sources is made up of never-ending variations. There may seem\r\nto be a very complete coalescence of the elements of the sire and dam\r\nin the foal, but it is not like either of them and yet it may resemble\r\nboth. A mere physical resemblance to a great sire is no evidence that the\r\ncolt will be equally great. I have seen many of the sons of the great\r\nHambletonian, and among them all the one that bore the strongest physical\r\nresemblance to him was of the least value, either as a performer or a\r\nprogenitor. Hambletonian left many great sons behind him, some of them\r\neven greater than himself, and while they all possessed certain family\r\ncharacteristics, I cannot recall a single one that strikingly resembled\r\nhim in his physical conformation. From this incident, as well as a\r\nthousand other similar ones, we cannot avoid the conclusion that heredity\r\ncontrols the whole animal, man or beast, in his mental as well as in his\r\nphysical constitution.\r\n\r\nCROSS HEREDITY is one of the forms of direct heredity, and is not very\r\nwell exemplified in trotting experiences, nor very valuable in the\r\nlessons it is supposed to teach. In its first form it embraces instances\r\nwhere the character of the sire is transmitted to his daughters and the\r\ncharacter of the dam is transmitted to her sons. Long ago I established\r\na table in the “Year Book” to embrace the sires of mares that produced\r\ntwo or more animals in the 2:30 list, but had failed to place any\r\nrepresentative there from their own loins. The development of this table\r\nsimply showed an array of sires that were not able to get 2:30 trotters,\r\nbut when their daughters were bred to horses of stronger inheritance,\r\nhorses indeed that were able to get trotters from almost any kind of\r\nmares, they produced foals that came within the circle. This was a\r\ngrandsire’s table and depended upon second causes, that is, the horses\r\nthat gave it life occupied secondary positions in it, and it presented\r\nbut little that was of value to the student of horse history. In the\r\ndiscussion of this particular form of heredity the books are filled up\r\nwith instances of vicious fathers begetting vicious daughters and vicious\r\nmothers producing vicious sons, with more or less uncertainty as to the\r\nindividual origin of the parties in question.\r\n\r\nINDIRECT AND COLLATERAL HEREDITY.—When a child or a colt does not\r\nresemble its parents, but “takes after” the grandfather or some more\r\nremote ancestor, it is said to be a case of atavism, or indirect or\r\ncollateral heredity. Twenty years ago I visited, by appointment, a\r\nbranch of my family at the old homestead of my great-grandfather, on\r\nthe maternal side. There never had been any knowledge of each other or\r\nintercourse between these two branches of the family. On arriving at my\r\ndestination I was warmly greeted by a gentleman who came forward from\r\nthe crowd and named me. As there were a good number of people alighting\r\nfrom the train at the same time I asked my cousin how he knew me, and he\r\nreplied that I bore such a striking resemblance to my grandfather that\r\nat a single glance he could have picked me out of a hundred men. This\r\ngrandfather was the father of my mother and he died when I was a small\r\nboy. But there was a still greater surprise awaiting me. My kinsman was\r\nan intelligent man of excellent sense, and during the few days I spent\r\nin his family he was to me a most interesting study. In a hundred ways\r\nhe reminded me of my brother, not in resemblance of face, for there was,\r\npractically, no resemblance; but in the action of his mind, in his way of\r\nputting things, and especially in his unstudied and peculiar gestures of\r\nhis hands in conversation, the one seemed to be a perfect reproduction\r\nof the other. They were both born and reared on farms, they were both\r\nheads of families, and they were both elders in the Presbyterian church.\r\nThe one was the third and the other the fourth remove from their common\r\nprogenitor. I have read carefully descriptions of many cases of mental\r\nheredity, but this case, coming under my own observation and deliberate\r\nstudy, seemed to be more thoroughly convincing than any or all others.\r\n\r\nThe fact that certain qualities may lie dormant through several\r\ngenerations and then be unexpectedly developed was well known to the\r\nancients more than two thousand years ago. Plutarch mentions a Greek\r\nwoman who gave birth to a negro child and was brought to trial for\r\nadultery, but it was discovered that she was descended in the fourth\r\ndegree from an Ethiopian. Montaigne expresses his astonishment at this,\r\nand remarks:\r\n\r\n    “Is it not marvelous that this drop of seed from which we are\r\n    produced should bear the impression, not only of the bodily\r\n    form, but even the thoughts and inclinations of our fathers?\r\n    Where does this drop of water keep its infinite number of\r\n    forms? How does it bear these likenesses through a progress\r\n    so haphazard and so irregular that the great-grandson shall\r\n    resemble the great-grandfather, the nephew the uncle?”\r\n\r\nThe most prolific and satisfactory sources of evidence in support of\r\nindirect or reversionary heredity are to be found in the crosses between\r\nthe white and the black races. They abound in all quarters wherever the\r\ntwo races are to be found, and many a proud family has been humbled\r\nto the dust when the long-concealed “black drop” makes its unexpected\r\nappearance. There are hundreds of such cases in the world, and it is\r\nimpossible to make even an approximation of the number of generations\r\nthat would be required to wash out the stain.\r\n\r\nHEREDITY OF INFLUENCE.—When the subject of “How to Breed the Trotting\r\nHorse” was in its infancy there was a wonderful amount of mystery\r\nabout it. Nobody could understand why one horse of the same general\r\nconformation should not trot just as fast as another. When it was found\r\nthat this way of looking at the problem would not meet the facts, one\r\nthought it was owing to the length of certain bones, another that it\r\nwas all in the hind quarters, another that it was “the trotting pitch,”\r\nanother that it was “a happy nick,” etc. When it was all made plain that\r\na horse was able to trot fast because his ancestors were able to trot\r\nfast, the seekers for the mysterious had nothing left that suited their\r\ntaste but the effects of first impregnations, resting on Lord Morton’s\r\nstory of the quagga and the mare, which is here dignified with the title\r\n“Heredity of Influence.” Now, just how “influence,” two or three years\r\nafter the event, should become a controlling factor in the paternity of\r\na colt, is a mystery sufficiently profound to satisfy our friends of\r\nearlier years, so intent upon finding something mysterious. For about\r\nthree-quarters of a century the story, coming from so reputable a source,\r\nhas been cited in many scientific bodies and accepted by many scientific\r\nmen and writers without a question or doubt. No writer, so far as I know,\r\nhas ever attempted to controvert it, and if the facts be well founded\r\nit demolishes in its conclusions all the laws of generation, to say\r\nnothing of the universal law of heredity. The point to be considered is,\r\nwhether the first impregnation influences the offspring of subsequent\r\nand different impregnations. In other words, whether the children of a\r\nwidow by her second husband will partake of the characteristics of her\r\nfirst husband. Ribot says “that from the psychological point of view, we\r\nare skeptical in regard to this form of heredity. The fact seems to be\r\nperfectly out of the order of things.” He then goes on to consider it as\r\nthough it might be true, and cites any number of the veriest fables in\r\nsupport of it, without ever stopping to inquire whether they have any\r\nfoundation of truth. In every assemblage of breeders brought together for\r\nthe purpose of discussing how best to breed and rear our domestic animals\r\nat a profit, there is always somebody to bring in the everlasting story\r\nof the mare and the quagga, not because it may have any relevancy to the\r\nsubject, but it is an opportunity not to be lost to show one’s learning.\r\nAs this story has served the purpose of showing off the learning of so\r\nmany thousands who never saw it, I will here give it in its original\r\nand official form. A communication from the Earl of Morton was read\r\nbefore the Royal Society of London, November 23, 1820, and published in\r\n“Philosophical Transactions” for 1821, p. 20, and is as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I yesterday had an opportunity of observing a singular fact in\r\n    natural history, which you may, perhaps, deem not unworthy of\r\n    being communicated to the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n    “Some years ago I was desirous of trying the experiment of\r\n    domesticating the quagga, and endeavored to procure some\r\n    individuals of that species. I obtained a male; but being\r\n    disappointed of a female, I tried to breed from the male quagga\r\n    and a young chestnut mare of seven-eighths Arabian blood, and\r\n    which had never been bred from; the result was the production\r\n    of a female hybrid, now five years old, and bearing both in her\r\n    form and in her color very decided indications of her mixed\r\n    origin. I subsequently parted with the seven-eighths Arabian\r\n    mare to Sir Gore Ousley, who has bred from her, by a very fine\r\n    black Arabian horse. I yesterday morning examined the produce,\r\n    namely, a two-year-old filly and a year-old colt. They have the\r\n    character of the Arabian breed as decidedly as can be expected,\r\n    where fifteen-sixteenths of the blood are Arabian; and they\r\n    are fine specimens of that breed; but both in their color and\r\n    in the hair of their manes they have a striking resemblance to\r\n    the quagga. Their color is bay, marked more or less like the\r\n    quagga, in a darker tint. Both are distinguished by the dark\r\n    line along the ridge of the back, the dark stripes across the\r\n    forehand, and the dark bars across the back part of the legs.\r\n    The stripes across the forehand of the colt are confined to\r\n    the withers, and the part of the neck next to them. Those on\r\n    the filly cover nearly the whole of the neck and the back as\r\n    far as the flanks. The color of her coat on the neck adjoining\r\n    the mane is pale, and approaching a dun, rendering the stripes\r\n    there more conspicuous than those on the colt. The same\r\n    pale tint appears in a less degree on the rump; and in this\r\n    circumstance of the dun tint also she resembles the quagga.\r\n\r\n    “The colt and filly were taken up from grass for my inspection,\r\n    and owing to the present state of their coats I could not\r\n    ascertain whether they bear any indications of spots on the\r\n    rump, the dark pasterns, or the narrow strips on the forehead,\r\n    with which the quagga is marked. They have no appearance of\r\n    the dark lines along the belly or the white tufts on the side\r\n    of the mane. Both their manes are black; that of the filly is\r\n    short and stiff, and stands upright; and Sir Gore Ousley’s\r\n    stud groom alleged it never was otherwise; that of the colt is\r\n    long, but so stiff as to arch upward, and to hang clear of the\r\n    side of the neck, in which circumstance it resembles that of a\r\n    hybrid. This is the more remarkable, as the mane of the Arabian\r\n    breed hangs lank and closer to the neck than those of most\r\n    others. The bars across the legs, both of the hybrid and of the\r\n    colt and filly, are more strongly defined and darker than those\r\n    on the legs of the quagga, which are very slightly marked; and\r\n    though the hybrid has several quagga marks which the colt and\r\n    filly have not, yet the most striking, namely, the stripes on\r\n    the forehand, are fewer and less apparent than those on the\r\n    colt and filly. These circumstances may appear singular, but\r\n    I think you will agree with me that they are trifles compared\r\n    with the extraordinary fact of so many striking features which\r\n    do not belong to the dam, being in two successive instances\r\n    communicated through her to the progeny not only of another\r\n    sire, who also had them not, but to a sire probably of another\r\n    species; for such we have very strong reasons for supposing the\r\n    quagga to be”\r\n\r\nThis is Lord Morton’s original quagga story without abridgement, the\r\nsubstance of which has been quoted and printed millions of times, but I\r\nnever have seen anything like an analysis of it, either for or against\r\nits value as determining any fact or principle in breeding. The elements\r\nare: a young chestnut mare, “seven-eighths Arabian blood,” was bred to a\r\nquagga and produced a hybrid. She was afterward bred to a black “Arabian”\r\nand produced a colt and a filly that were supposed to be marked like the\r\nquagga; hence, first impregnations influence all subsequent foals; and\r\nhence “the heredity of influence,” as called by some scientists. Lord\r\nMorton has given an intelligent and, no doubt, faithful description of\r\nthe colt and the filly that came out of the mare that had previously\r\nproduced the hybrid quagga; but he has failed to show that none of the\r\nnear-by ancestors of the sire and dam of this colt and filly were of a\r\ndun color and were marked just as the colt and filly were marked. Until\r\nit is shown that the peculiar markings of this colt and filly could not\r\nhave been inherited from their natural ancestors, the half-formed theory\r\nthat they were the result of the coupling with the quagga, years before,\r\nwholly fails to satisfy the human understanding. When Lord Morton tells\r\nus that the dam was seven-eighths, and the sire full Arabian, he seems\r\nto think he has covered that point; but he has not, for he has not shown\r\nthat there was a single drop of Arabian blood in either of them. It\r\nmust not be forgotten that at the period here referred to all Eastern\r\nand Southern horses were called Arabians, when not one in fifty of them\r\never saw Arabia either through his own eyes or through the eyes of any\r\nof his ancestors. The composite material out of which the English race\r\nhorse was built up was of all colors, including the dun, with the dark\r\nstripe on his back, the short stripes or patches on his shoulders, and\r\nthe transverse bars on his legs. A horse of this color, I am told, once\r\nwon the Derby. The Kattywar horses of Northwestern India, Mr. Darwin\r\ninforms us, are from fifteen to sixteen hands high, of all colors, with\r\nthe several shades of dun the most common, and when one of them fails of\r\nhaving the spinal stripe, the shoulder stripes, and the leg stripes the\r\npurity of his breeding is doubted. This is the type of horse the British\r\nofficers ride, and when their term of service expires sometimes bring\r\nhome with them. There are many duns in Persia and in Eastern Asia Minor,\r\nI am informed, and the stripes seem to belong to the color. In Norway the\r\ncolor of the native horse is dun and the stripes are considered evidence\r\nof pure breeding. Many of the mountain horses of Spain are duns, with\r\nthe stripes. The dun color prevailed, to a greater or less extent, among\r\nthe native English horses of three hundred years ago, and some of them\r\nwere brought to this country in the early colonial period. Mr. Darwin,\r\nin his “Animals and Plants under Domestication,” fully describes the dun\r\nhorses of Devonshire, and in order to be clearly understood he figures\r\none of them showing the dark stripes on the shoulder and the transverse\r\nbars upon the legs. I have seen numbers of dun horses so marked, in this\r\ncountry, the most conspicuous that I can now recall being Wapsie, the\r\ndistinguished son of Green’s Bashaw. The fact that horses of this color\r\nand marking are to be found in all parts of the globe, has led many\r\nthoughtful writers to the conclusion that these characteristics are among\r\nthe very earliest in the history of the horse. To bring this instance to\r\na close, I must say:\r\n\r\n1. Beyond the color alone of the sire and dam of this colt and filly,\r\nthere is no evidence whatever that they might not have inherited, by\r\nordinary generation, the color and markings from some of their ancestors.\r\n\r\n2. The miscegenous breeding of the ass upon the mare has been practiced,\r\nwe know, for more than three thousand years, and yet in all that time,\r\nand down to our own day and experiences, there has been no established\r\nindication that the first impregnation of the filly by the ass had any\r\ninfluence whatever upon her subsequent produce by the horse.\r\n\r\nThis theory of the first impregnation having an influence on all\r\nsubsequent produce is probably more generally maintained among dog\r\nfanciers than any other class of breeders. In some instances when a\r\nvaluable maiden bitch gets astray she is banished from the kennel and\r\neither destroyed or given away. For this foolish notion some antique\r\nauthority might be cited. Burdach, a French writer on physiology, says:\r\n\r\n    “If a bitch be once put to a dog of another race, every litter\r\n    of puppies afterward will include one belonging to that other\r\n    breed, except the first time she be put only to dogs of her own\r\n    breed.”\r\n\r\nThis is a kind of pseudo science that is only calculated to mislead,\r\nfor the vital facts are omitted. What was the pedigree of the bitch?\r\nShe may have looked like a well-bred pointer and a high price may have\r\nbeen paid for her, but her sire may have been a mongrel, or, possibly, a\r\nmiserable cur. No dog breeder or dog dealer has ever been known to drown\r\nthe results of a _mésalliance_ if it was a fairly good-looking puppy. It\r\ngoes into the records as a thoroughbred and finds a market. When a dog\r\nand a bitch, seeming to be well-bred and costing a high price, bring into\r\nthe world a litter of puppies showing a mixed inheritance, the fancier at\r\nonce jumps to the conclusion that there is something mysterious about it,\r\nand as he has heard of the evil results of first impregnations, he thinks\r\nhe has discovered the source of the trouble and straightway this is\r\nanother example resulting from first impregnation. He then goes back on\r\nthe dealer, or possibly the breeder, and there to conceal the fact that\r\nthe blood of his kennel was not pure, he would naturally play the rogue\r\nand admit that the young bitch might have got astray. This satisfies the\r\nunsophisticated owner, and another trick of an unscrupulous “dog jockey”\r\ngoes on record as a case of “heredity of influence,” when in fact it was\r\nnothing more nor less than a dirty fraud in the breeding of the dog or\r\nbitch, or both.\r\n\r\nSome of the early French writers on scientific subjects, as Burdach,\r\nMichelet, etc., advanced the theory more than a hundred years ago\r\nthat the children of a second marriage, in some cases, inherited the\r\nresemblance and character of the first husband. In the nature of things\r\nthis theory could have but very feeble support and that chiefly among\r\nscandalmongers. In connection with this phase of “heredity of influence”\r\nI will give a little instance of my personal experience. Twenty years\r\nago, or more, I was making an address before an association, in a New\r\nEngland city, on the subject of “How to Breed the Trotting Horse.” The\r\naudience was very large and composed exclusively of gentlemen. At the\r\nopening it was announced that at the close of each specific topic an\r\nopportunity would be given to any one in the audience to ask questions\r\non the thoughts presented. The signal had hardly been given when a\r\ngentleman arose in the audience and raised the question whether I had not\r\nomitted an important fact in heredity? He then went on to rehearse the\r\neverlasting quagga story, with a most confident flourish of his learning\r\nand a sure grasp on a triumph.\r\n\r\n“The quagga story,” I remarked, “is well known to everybody, but there\r\nare some facts about it that are not known to anybody. The mare herself\r\nmay have been from a dun tribe of horses, or the horse to which she was\r\nafterward bred may have been from such a tribe, hundreds of which have\r\nstripes on the back, the shoulders and the legs, and thus the stripes\r\nmight be accounted for by indirect heredity; not because the quagga had\r\nstripes, but because the dun horse ancestry had stripes. Most people,\r\nprobably, look upon it as a freak of nature, and as the case has never\r\nduplicated itself, in all the years before or since, it fails to be a\r\npractical question, and in our personal experiences as breeders, we need\r\nnot be afraid of suffering harm from it.”\r\n\r\n“Your explanation,” replied my interlocutor, “fails to cover the case, I\r\nthink, for I have seen, with my own eyes, instances of it in the human\r\nfamily and I will relate one. A dozen years ago, or more, a friend of\r\nmine married a lady who was a brunette in complexion, with black eyes and\r\nblack hair. He was of florid complexion, with blue eyes and sandy hair,\r\njust about the color of my own. After three or four years the husband\r\ndied leaving two children of his own complexion and color of eyes and\r\nhair. In course of time the widow married a man with black hair and\r\nblack eyes, and there came a second set of children that were as perfect\r\nreproductions of the first husband as his own children were in complexion\r\nand color of hair.”\r\n\r\n“How long have you personally known this family, and have you ever seen\r\nthese two sets of children?”\r\n\r\n“I have known the family intimately ever since the first marriage and I\r\nhave seen both sets of children very often.”\r\n\r\n“You certainly have had abundant opportunity to know whereof you affirm,\r\nand the facts seem so plain that it would be a refinement on folly to\r\nundertake to contradict them; but there is one element in this case that\r\nhas not been explained, and it is a vital one. How are we to know whether\r\nsome man of ‘sandy complexion’ and with ‘hair and eyes just the color of\r\nyours,’ is not the father of this second set of children?”\r\n\r\nThis ended the colloquy in a “roof-raising” shout, and I never have\r\nbeen called upon since, in a public meeting, to even allude to the\r\n“heredity of influence.” With the experiences of thousands of years of\r\nmiscegnatious breeding between the ass and the mare and no indication\r\namong the writers of the ancients as to the evil and abiding effects of\r\nfirst impregnations; and with the experiences of more than a century in\r\nthis country, with the same results, we are compelled to throw over all\r\nclaims of this kind until furnished with full and complete pedigrees of\r\nthe sire and dam, showing the color and markings of each individual for a\r\nnumber of generations.\r\n\r\nHEREDITY OF ACQUIRED CHARACTERS AND INSTINCTS.—On this point there\r\nis a lack of unanimity among the promoters of the “primordial germ”\r\ntheory, and the principal advocate of the negative side of this question\r\nappears to be Professor Weismann. Mere opinions of men, no difference\r\nhow profound their learning, cannot be of any value, unless they are\r\nsustained by actual experiences, on questions of this kind. To determine\r\nthis matter we are not dependent upon any of the explanations of the\r\ncentral Darwinian hypothesis of creation without a Creator, for we have\r\nall around us, safely within the historic period of human observation\r\nand experience, mountains of evidence, so to speak, heaped upon us, going\r\nto show that “acquired character and instincts” are transmitted and\r\nbecome hereditary.\r\n\r\nDr. Pritchard, in his “Natural History of Man,” gives the following\r\nillustration on this point:\r\n\r\n    “Two other very important observations made by M. Roulin, in\r\n    South America, were pointed out by M. Geoffrey St. Hillaire, in\r\n    his report to the Academy of Sciences. They refer to the fact\r\n    of the hereditary transmission of habits originally impressed\r\n    with care and art upon the ancestors. Of this fact I will\r\n    adduce other examples in the sequel; at present I only advert\r\n    to M. Roulin’s observations. The horses bred on the grazing\r\n    farms of the table-lands of the Cordillera are carefully taught\r\n    a peculiar pace, which is a sort of running amble. This is\r\n    not their natural mode of progression, but they are inured to\r\n    it very early, and the greatest pains are taken to prevent\r\n    them from moving in any other gait; in this way the acquired\r\n    habit becomes a second nature. It happens occasionally that\r\n    such horses becoming lame, or no longer fit for use, it is\r\n    then customary to let them loose, if they happen to be well\r\n    grown stallions, into the pasture grounds. It is constantly\r\n    observed that these horses become the sires of a race to which\r\n    the ambling pace is natural, and which requires no teaching.\r\n    The fact is so well known that such colts have received a\r\n    particular name; they are termed ‘aguilillas.’”\r\n\r\nThe fact that there were some pacers in South America came to me from\r\nmany sources, and especially from gentlemen of intelligence and character\r\nwho had spent years in that country, and was for a long time a puzzle\r\nto me. All the evidences of history went to show that the horse stock\r\nof South America was Spanish, and no evidence could be found that the\r\nSpanish horse was a pacer, or that there was any tendency to pace in\r\nthe blood of the Spanish horse. This report to the French Academy of\r\nSciences was made in the early part of this century and is really the\r\nfirst information I have ever had of Spanish horses pacing. Dr. Pritchard\r\nwas one of the earlier modern writers on natural history and stands very\r\nhigh as a man of conscience as well as learning. The surprising feature\r\nin this South American experience is the wide and, apparently, immediate\r\nmeasure of success that seems to have followed the training to the pacing\r\ngait in its transmission. It may be taken as a rule that the changing of\r\nthe gait from the diagonal to the lateral, or _vice versa_, is a slow\r\nprocess, and it seems to me that with few exceptions it would require\r\nseveral generations before the new habit of action would become fixed\r\nin the breed. It is just possible, however, that there may have been a\r\ntincture of pacing blood in the Spanish horses of the sixteenth century.\r\nThe Visigoths, one of the early Asiatic hordes that overran Europe, first\r\nsettled in Scandinavia, and the southern part of Sweden is still called\r\n“Gothland.” After a long stay in that country they became dissatisfied\r\nwith soil and climate and determined to seek another. According to the\r\nhistorians, they first migrated in a southeastward direction and from\r\nthere in a southwestward till they reached the southern part of France,\r\nfrom which they soon passed over into Spain, which they subdued, and\r\nestablished there a dynasty which lasted two hundred years. In A.D. 711\r\nthe Saracens from Africa crossed over, and after a very bloody battle\r\nlasting two days, defeated Rhoderic, the last of the dynasty, and cut his\r\narmy to pieces. In Scandinavia, and especially in Norway and Sweden, we\r\nfind plenty of dun horses that are pacers, and they are recognized as a\r\nvery old breed. In the mountains of Spain we also find small dun horses,\r\nand it is, perhaps, not an unreasonable possibility that the Visigoths\r\nmay have carried some of their horse stock with them in their migration\r\nfrom the North to the South of Europe, and thus this habit of action\r\nthat may have remained for centuries latent in the breed may have been\r\nunusually plastic in its restoration. This, however, is a mere surmise as\r\nto a possibility and cannot displace the historic observations reported\r\nby M. Roulin and presented before the French Academy. The gait of the\r\nSouth American pacers, as I understand it, is not that of the pure pace,\r\nwith two strokes completing the revolution, but is more like the “saddle\r\ngaits” that we find in the West and Southwest of our own country. The\r\ntrue pace seems to be exceptional, because that is not a saddle gait. It\r\nis a fact often observed in this country that foals from parents trained\r\nto the saddle gaits will take to those gaits naturally and as soon as\r\nthey are dropped. In a preceding part of this work I have given some\r\nconsideration to the fact that three or four hundred years ago the horses\r\nof our English ancestors were largely pacers, and to the methods adopted\r\nin that day for changing the action from the diagonal to the lateral\r\ngait—the hopples, rattles, weights, etc. The descendants of those horses,\r\nbrought to this country by the colonists, as will be seen at another\r\nplace, were nearly all pacers.\r\n\r\nThe following letter, addressed by Dr. William Huggins to Charles\r\nDarwin and by him published in “Nature” twenty years ago, very strongly\r\nillustrates the heredity of instincts, and as it is authentic and true\r\nbeyond question I will here insert it. Dr. Huggins says:\r\n\r\n    “I wish to communicate to you a curious case of mental\r\n    peculiarity. I possess an English mastiff, by name Kepler, a\r\n    son of the celebrated Turk out of Venus. I brought the dog,\r\n    when six weeks old, from the stable in which he was born. The\r\n    first time I took him out he started back in alarm at the\r\n    first butcher’s shop he had ever seen. I soon found he had a\r\n    violent antipathy to butchers and butchers’ shops. When six\r\n    months old a servant took him with her on an errand. At a short\r\n    distance before coming to the house she had to pass a butcher’s\r\n    shop; the dog threw himself down (being led by a string), and\r\n    neither coaxing nor threats would make him pass the shop. The\r\n    dog was too heavy to be carried, and as a crowd collected,\r\n    the servant had to return with the dog more than a mile, and\r\n    then go without him. This occurred about two years ago. The\r\n    antipathy still continues, but the dog will pass nearer to a\r\n    shop than he formerly would. About two months ago, in a little\r\n    book on dogs, published by Dean, I discovered that the same\r\n    strange antipathy is shown in the father, Turk. I then wrote\r\n    to Mr. Nichols, the former owner of Turk, to ask him for any\r\n    information he might have on the point. He replied: ‘I can say\r\n    that the same antipathy exists in King, the sire of Turk, in\r\n    Turk, in Punch (son of Turk), out of Meg, and in Paris (son\r\n    of Turk out of Juno). Paris has the greatest antipathy, as he\r\n    would hardly go into a street where a butcher’s shop is, and\r\n    would run away after passing it. When a cart with a butcher’s\r\n    man came into the place where the dogs were kept, although they\r\n    could not see him, they all were ready to break their chains. A\r\n    master butcher, dressed privately, called one evening on Paris’\r\n    master to see the dog. He had hardly entered the house before\r\n    the dog (though shut in) was so much excited that he had to be\r\n    put into a shed, and the butcher was forced to leave before\r\n    seeing the dog. The same dog, at Hastings, made a spring at a\r\n    gentleman who came into the hotel. The owner caught the dog and\r\n    apologized, and said he never knew him to do so before, except\r\n    when a butcher came to his house. The gentleman at once said\r\n    that was his business. So you see that they inherited these\r\n    antipathies, and show a great deal of breed.’”\r\n\r\nSome ancestor, not far removed, of these three generations of dogs\r\nmust have suffered a life of oppression and cruelty at the hands of an\r\nunfeeling master, and that master must have been a butcher. We fail to\r\nunderstand and appreciate the mentality of the dog and the horse, and\r\nas they are above the average of the brute creation we fail of a word\r\nmidway between instinct and reason to express that mentality. We call it\r\n“instinct,” and correctly, too, but this grade of instinct requires a\r\nmore expressive word to represent it. That a feeling of antipathy should\r\nhave been so deeply seated in the nature and life of a dog that the\r\nresentment and hatred should have been transmitted to his descendants\r\nfor three generations in succession is a very remarkable instance of\r\nthe heredity of instinct. As a companion piece to the foregoing and as\r\nshowing the difference between the hatred of one dog and the gratitude\r\nand love of another, I will relate an instance that came under my own\r\nobservation and knowledge more than forty years ago. General John G.\r\nGordon was a merchant in Muscatine, Iowa, and Dr. George Reeder was a\r\nphysician of great skill and very large practice. These two gentlemen\r\nwere among my most intimate personal friends. On a certain occasion one\r\nof Gordon’s well-to-do farmer customers brought him a puppy a few months\r\nold as a present. He had no use for a dog and didn’t want one, but he was\r\nnot willing to forfeit either the good wishes or the custom of his farmer\r\nfriend, so he accepted the gift with thanks. When he took the puppy home\r\nin the evening there was consternation in the household, and in a family\r\nconference it was decided that he should not be allowed to run through\r\nthe house with his dirty feet, and thereupon he was consigned to the cow\r\nstable, and that became his home as long as he lived. Every night and\r\nmorning he got a liberal ration of milk fresh from the cow and they soon\r\nbecame inseparable friends. In cold nights, as if by mutual agreement, he\r\nalways slept cuddled up close to the cow. At that time in the history of\r\nthe town, the country was open and pasture abundant in every direction,\r\nand everybody kept a cow. In the mornings these cows would start out to\r\ntheir grazing grounds, in bands, radiating in every direction, and in\r\nthe evenings could be seen “the lowing herds wind slowly o’er the lea.”\r\nGordon’s dog never missed a day for years in going with his friend the\r\ncow and returning with her in the evening.\r\n\r\nDr. Reeder used two or three horses in his practice, and his stable was\r\non the same alley, and some ten or twelve rods distant from Gordon’s\r\ncow stable. One day in winter time he was having his bins filled with\r\ncorn in the ear, and to make room for it all he had to fill up a large\r\ndry-goods box that stood in one corner of the stable. While he was\r\nsupervising the delivery of the corn Gordon’s dog came in, reared up on\r\nhis hind legs, seized an ear of corn and made off with it. The doctor\r\nwas very much surprised at this act of the dog as he never had seen or\r\nheard of a dog eating corn. While he was thinking about this strange\r\nact of the dog, he came back again and seized another ear and made off\r\nwith it. This time the doctor watched him, and he carried it direct\r\nto his friend the cow, dropped it before her, and she soon made away\r\nwith it. This phenomenal exhibition of the attachment of one animal to\r\nanother of entirely different nature aroused the doctor’s desire for a\r\nfurther confirmation of what he had seen. Concealing himself behind the\r\ndoor he awaited further developments and in a little while the dog came\r\nback, seized the third ear, and whipping past some other cows, carried\r\nit safely to his friend. I have seen this dog a hundred times, and he\r\nwas a mongrel nondescript, about the size of the average pointer, with\r\nnothing remarkable about his appearance; but in all the illustrations of\r\nall the naturalists I have not met with any authenticated instance where\r\ncharacter in a dumb animal was so beautifully exhibited. In history we\r\nhave many touching examples of the attachment of the dog to his master\r\nand of his heroism in defending the weak against the strong, but this\r\ncase seems to be unique. Here is a character developed that is far more\r\nthan “the sum of inherited habits.” We may call it instinct, but that\r\nword fails to express it. In whatever light we view this character, it\r\nhas in it an element of reason and we have no word that expresses it.\r\n\r\nThe oldest written evidence we have of the origin of the setter dog dates\r\nback about two hundred years, in which we find John Harris agreeing to\r\nteach Henry Herbert’s “spaniel bitch Quand” to set game. Allusions are\r\nmade in the old writers to dogs used for this purpose long before, but\r\nthe setter certainly has an ancestry dating back at least two hundred\r\nyears. The pointer is of much more recent origin and seems to have come\r\nfrom an ancestry wholly distinct from that of the setter, and yet, in the\r\nfield, it would be very difficult for the most competent jury to decide\r\nwhich stands to his game with the greater steadiness. It is agreed, I\r\nthink, among experienced sportsmen and breeders that the best dogs are\r\nthe result of couplings made in the midst of the hunting season when the\r\ninstincts of the parents are aroused and active under the gun. Puppies\r\nso bred are already half-trained when they are whelped. The instinct to\r\npoint the game instead of rushing upon it is an instinct acquired at an\r\nearlier or later date, well within the historic period, and we know that\r\nit is transmitted and inherited under the laws of heredity. We know also\r\nthat this instinct is strengthened and improved by training and use;\r\nand at the same time it is weakened, if not obliterated, by neglect and\r\nnon-use for a few generations.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch collie, with plenty to do, is altogether the most useful, and\r\nhence, in a utilitarian sense, the most valuable of all the varieties of\r\nthe canine race. In understanding his master’s commands and the motions\r\nof his hand in the management of the flock, he evinces an intelligence,\r\nan instinct, that is almost human. There is a marked distinction between\r\nthe instinct of the pointer and the collie. The former acts chiefly\r\nby his innate mental endowments, while the latter is at his best when\r\ncarrying out the will of his master. In both cases the instinct was\r\nacquired in comparatively recent years, and it is now fixed in the breeds\r\nand is transmitted with great certainty.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable results in the development and use of an instinct\r\nthat was practically latent, or never developed, are to be found in the\r\nhistory of the American Trotting Horse. Fifty-one years ago Lady Suffolk\r\nwas the first trotter to cover the mile in 2:29½. Four years later\r\nPelham, a converted pacer, trotted in 2:28, and four years still later\r\nHighland Maid, a converted pacer, trotted in 2:27. In 1859 Flora Temple\r\ntrotted in 2:19¾; in 1874 Goldsmith Maid trotted in 2:14; in 1885 Maud\r\nS. trotted in 2:08¾; in 1892 Nancy Hanks trotted in 2:04; and in 1894\r\nAlix trotted in 2:03¾. But a greater performance than any of these was\r\nthat of the two-year-old colt, Arion, when in 1891 he covered the mile in\r\n2:10¾. I have no hesitation in pronouncing this the greatest performance\r\never made, to this date, not because it was the fastest, as shown by\r\nthe watch, but because it was made by a two-year-old, and from this\r\nfact there had been no time for prolonged and skillful training. He was\r\nessentially the product of heredity and not the result of education.\r\n\r\nFifty-one years ago there was but one animal in the 2:30 list, and at the\r\nclose of 1896 there were over fifteen thousand within that limit and far\r\nmore than fifteen thousand others hovering on its border. This astounding\r\nresult must be attributed primarily to a trotting inheritance, but this\r\ninheritance has been constantly strengthened, reinforced, fortified by\r\nthe acquired capacities resulting from the development of the trotting\r\nspeed of succeeding generations. This is not a mere estimate of what has\r\nresulted from acquired characters and instincts, for if we put all the\r\nobservations of all the writers on subjects of natural history, large and\r\nsmall, together, they make but a meager and unsatisfactory showing when\r\ncompared with the fifteen thousand actual experiences, officially noted\r\nand recorded on the spot and printed in “Wallace’s Year Book.” In all the\r\nworld there is no other collection of statistics so vast, so accurate\r\nand so valuable as is there to be found, touching the question we are\r\nconsidering.\r\n\r\nWhile the heredity of acquired characters and instincts is thus clearly\r\nand fully established, there is another truth intimately connected with\r\nit that should not be forgotten. In an inheritance springing from recent\r\nacquisitions there seems to be less of adhesive strength than in one\r\nthat has come down through many generations. This being true, it follows\r\nthat whether the lines of inheritance be long or short there must be\r\nan intelligent and constant exercise of good judgment in strengthening\r\nthem by bringing the best and strongest together and uniting them in\r\nthe prospective foal. When this has been done it is possible that the\r\nfoal may not be of much value, but the chances of success are in exact\r\nproportion to the strength of all the lines of inheritance that are\r\nunited in the foal. Beyond the chance of failure and beyond the average\r\nchance of an average production, there is a chance for something better\r\nthan any of the ancestors. This latter hope always has been and always\r\nwill be the inspiration of the breeder. In his structure and form he\r\nmay be an improvement on his parents, but his value as a trotter can\r\nonly be determined by the development of his instincts and speed as a\r\ntrotter. Without such development he may transmit what he inherits,\r\nbut he adds nothing to his inheritance except by the development of\r\nhis own powers. These accretions, growing out of the development of\r\nsucceeding generations, are the material cause that has placed the\r\nAmerican Trotter at the very edge of two minutes to the mile, and with\r\nwise management will eventually carry him away beyond that rate of speed.\r\nThis whole topic may be summed up in a single sentence: every acquisition\r\nof eminence and superiority adds something to the value of what is\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\nHEREDITY OF BAD QUALITIES, UNSOUNDNESS, ETC.—Under the laws of\r\ninheritance no distinction can be made between the desirable and the\r\nundesirable, nor between the earlier or later acquisitions, as they\r\nare all liable to be transmitted and to become hereditary. The bitter\r\nmust go with the sweet. Dropping below is just as liable to occur as\r\nrising above what might be considered the average inheritance of the\r\nimmediate parents. This may result from following or throwing back to\r\nsome undesirable or unsound cross that may exist in some of the lines\r\nof inheritance which possibly may be distant several generations. As a\r\npractical consideration it makes but little difference whether a tendency\r\nto, or a fully developed, unsoundness has been in the inheritance for\r\ngenerations, or whether it may be the result of some recent accident or\r\ninjury, it is liable to be transmitted. It is known to everybody that\r\nthe great running horse Lexington was blind, and it was urged that his\r\nblindness was not congenital, but the result of an accident; hence it\r\nwas argued by those interested that it would not be unsafe to breed to\r\nhim. It was stated and repeated a hundred times that while in training\r\nhe got loose in his stable and stuffed himself at the oats bin, and\r\nwithout knowing this his trainer took him out next morning and ran him\r\na trial of four miles, from the effects of which he lost his sight.\r\nWithout giving full credence to this as the cause of his blindness, it is\r\nnevertheless true that he filled the country with blind horses. If, for\r\nexample, a joint or a ligament or a muscle of the hind leg be sprained by\r\noverexertion or by a misstep, a spavin or a curb may develop, or possibly\r\nsomething still worse, and this is a blemish and generally an unsoundness\r\nthat is likely to be transmitted, if not in a developed form, then in an\r\nunmistakable tendency in that direction, which, in turn, will make its\r\nappearance in succeeding generations. The horse world, and I might say,\r\nthe whole animal kingdom under domestication, abounds in examples, seen\r\nand unseen, of unsoundness originating in injuries to the parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nHOW THE TROTTING HORSE IS BRED (_Continued_).\r\n\r\n    Trotting speed first supposed to be an accident—Then, that it\r\n    came from the runner—William Wheelan’s views—Test of powers of\r\n    endurance—The term “thoroughbred” much abused—Definition of\r\n    “thoroughbred”—How trotters may be made “thoroughly bred”—How\r\n    to study pedigrees—Reward offered for the production of a\r\n    thoroughbred horse that was a natural pacer—The trotter\r\n    more lasting than the runner—The dam of Palo Alto—Arion as\r\n    a two-year-old—Only three stallions have been able to get\r\n    trotters from running-bred mares—“Structural incongruity”—The\r\n    pacer and trotter inseparable—How to save the trot and reduce\r\n    the ratio of pacers—Development a necessity—Table proving this\r\n    proposition—The “tin cup” policy a failure—Woodburn at the\r\n    wrong end of the procession.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the question of speed in the trotter began to be considered,\r\neither from a historical or a philosophical standpoint, or, in other\r\nwords, a question involving scientific truths, there was a universal\r\nconcurrence in the idea that speed at the trot was an accident and\r\nthat there was nothing of inheritance or heredity about it. This idea\r\nwas greatly strengthened by the performances of such horses as Boston\r\nHorse, Rattler, Edwin Forrest, Dutchman, Confidence, Moscow, Pelham,\r\nFlora Temple, Tacony, etc., whose origin and blood were wholly unknown,\r\nwhile they were on the turf. Contemporaneous with these there were such\r\nsplendid performers as Topgallant, Screwdriver, Lady Suffolk, Sally\r\nMiller, O’Blennis and many others that were known to be descended from\r\nMessenger, a horse that was looked upon by everybody as a “thoroughbred.”\r\nHence, the conclusion that the flying trotter was either an accident in\r\nbreeding, or his speed qualities came from the English running horse.\r\nThe fact that such champion trotters, in their day, as Pelham, Highland\r\nMaid, etc., had originally been pacers and changed from the lateral\r\nto the diagonal gait was sedulously concealed from the public, during\r\ntheir day, and only after they had passed away was this bar-sinister\r\nin their origin brought to light. Doubtless this same fact might have\r\nbeen developed in the origin of Edwin Forrest and others, if action had\r\nbeen taken in time. In that day—say the first half of this century—it\r\nis not remarkable that the plebeian origin of some of our most famous\r\nearly trotters was concealed, for everybody was claiming a thoroughbred\r\nancestry, and the more famous the performer the more certain he was to be\r\nfurnished with a thoroughbred pedigree.\r\n\r\n“Whatever is of value in the trotter must come from the runner, and\r\nwhatever is of value in the runner must come from the Arab,” was the\r\nview that was universally accepted when I was a boy. And yet there were\r\nthousands of fast trotters and fast pacers in this country long before\r\nthe first running horse was brought from England, and England itself was\r\nabundantly supplied with horses several hundred years before there was\r\na horse in Arabia. These two facts are historical, and the dates make\r\nthem incontrovertible. Some forty or fifty years ago William Wheelan,\r\na successful trainer and driver of trotting horses in this country,\r\ntook some trotters over to England, to try his “luck,” as others had\r\ndone before him, in making matches and winning stakes. He was quite\r\nsuccessful, and when he came home he was kept busy answering questions\r\nabout English horses and why they did not have more trotters there. He\r\nreplied that “there were plenty of horses that could trot as well or\r\nbetter than our American horses, if they were trained; they had plenty of\r\nblood and most of them good limbs and feet, with all the substance that\r\nwas needed.” This made William Wheelan an authority, and his opinion was\r\nquoted all over the land; which went to prove that the way to breed the\r\ntrotter was to get plenty of running blood into his veins. About this\r\ntime the English running horse Trustee was bred on a famous trotting\r\nmare, Fanny Pullen, a daughter of Winthrop Messenger, of Maine, and the\r\nproduce was the gelding Trustee, the first to trot twenty miles within\r\nthe hour, or at least the first to make that distance regularly and to\r\nrule. This gave a tremendous “boost” to running blood, as everybody\r\nexcept Hiram Woodruff ascribed the result to the great powers of the\r\nimported running horse. All subsequent experiences fully demonstrated\r\nthat Hiram Woodruff, although alone, was right; for although Trustee’s\r\nblood commingled more kindly with trotting blood than most of the other\r\nrunning horses, he left no trotters but this one. The highest rate of\r\nspeed of which this gelding was capable was about 2:40, and at last, in\r\na race of mile heats with some fifth-rate old pelter, at Cincinnati,\r\nOhio, on a very hot day, he fell exhausted on the track and died from\r\nthe effects of the heat. But the great fame of being the only horse able\r\nto trot twenty miles within the hour did not long remain with this son\r\nof imported Trustee. Five others have done the same thing, viz., Captain\r\nMagowan, Controller, John Stewart, Mattie Howard, and Lady Fulton, all of\r\nwhom went faster than Trustee, except Lady Fulton.\r\n\r\nThere have been many crucial tests of the “staying qualities” of running\r\nblood in the trotter, as against the trotter without any running blood,\r\nin which the running blood has uniformly been worsted. The last of these\r\nwhich I now recall was a match for two thousand dollars between Scotland,\r\na half-bred son of imported Bonnie Scotland, and Lizzie M., by Thomas\r\nJefferson, and out of a pacing mare. The race was two-mile heats, best\r\nthree in five—a very unusual race, and admirably adapted to test the\r\nstaying powers of the contestants. Scotland was a fast and well-seasoned\r\ntrotter; while the mare had, probably, a little higher flight of speed\r\nshe never had been tried at such a distance, and in her breeding she was\r\nshort, and had not a single drop of running blood in her inheritance. The\r\nmare won the first and second heats in 4:56—5:03, and the gelding the\r\nthird heat in 4:55½, the fastest in the race, but he was not able to come\r\nagain, and the last heat was won by the mare in 4:58½. This race took\r\nplace at Philadelphia in 1883, and if, at that time, there still remained\r\nany advocates of “more running blood in the trotter,” they have not since\r\nbeen in evidence, with two or three addle-pated exceptions.\r\n\r\nIn looking back over the many years I have devoted to the literature of\r\nthe horse, and especially to the breeding of the trotting horse, I can\r\nfind no word in the English language that has been so much abused as the\r\nword “thoroughbred.” A minister wrote a great, pretentious book on the\r\nhorse in which he maintained that the Morgan horse was a “thoroughbred.”\r\nA lawyer wrote another pretentious book in which he maintained that the\r\ntrotting horse Dexter was a “thoroughbred.” With these two shining lights\r\nin the learned professions writing books on the horse and pronouncing\r\nthis family or that individual “thoroughbred” without knowing the meaning\r\nof the term, we should not deal too severely with uneducated men for\r\nfollowing their example. The minister and the lawyer evidently had\r\nalways heard the term “thoroughbred” applied to what men considered the\r\nbest, and when they were discussing their favorites which they considered\r\nthe best, they naturally called them “thoroughbreds” without knowing what\r\nthey were saying. This was more than twenty years ago, and was really\r\nthe popular conception of the meaning of the term at that time. Not one\r\nman in a thousand then knew that the term had any other meaning than\r\nthe individual superiority of the animal, and that it applied only to\r\nthe pedigree, or concentration of blood in the veins of the animal, was\r\nquite foreign to the popular conception. After the founding of _Wallace’s\r\nMonthly_ the light began to dawn on this as well as on many other\r\nquestions, and to-day the true meaning of the term is very generally\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nTo constitute a “thoroughbred” of whatever variety or species the animal\r\nmust possess a certain number of uncontaminated crosses of his own\r\nbreed, and this applies to all kinds of domestic animals that are bred\r\nfor special uses or qualities. There is no law determining the number of\r\nthese uncontaminated crosses, except the law of usage. The cattle men,\r\nI think, were the first to establish a rule on this subject, in this\r\ncountry, and they did it on enlightened and scientific principles. It was\r\nfound in experience that the danger of atavism, or throwing back to some\r\nundesirable ancestor, was diminished in the ratio of the number of pure\r\ncrosses through which the animal was descended. At two crosses it was\r\nfound that there were many reversions to some type outside of the breed;\r\nat three crosses there were not so many; at four there were very few,\r\nand at five reversions had practically disappeared. While some required\r\nanother cross the majority drove the stake at the fifth generation,\r\nproclaiming thereby that an animal bred through five uncontaminated\r\ngenerations of ancestors was free from the dangers of reversion, and\r\nhence was “thoroughly bred.” This is the formula and this is the\r\nprinciple, and it applies with equal propriety to the colt, the calf, the\r\npig, the puppy, the chick, or the birdling. In this phrase “thoroughly\r\nbred” we have the origin, reason and meaning of the term “thoroughbred.”\r\nThe formula of this rule, if tabulated, would show two parents: next,\r\nfour grandparents; next eight great-grandparents; next sixteen ancestors\r\nand next thirty-two, making in all sixty-two ancestors, all of which\r\nmust be “thoroughly bred.” This rule of breeding is not limited to the\r\nrunning horse alone, but applies to all the varieties of our domestic\r\nanimals; and whenever the point is reached at which the danger of\r\nreversion has been overcome the animal is “thoroughly bred,” and the term\r\n“thoroughbred” applied just as properly to one kind of domestic animal as\r\nto another.\r\n\r\nThe question here arises as to whether the American Trotting Horse can\r\nbe so thoroughly bred as to be entitled to be ranked as a thoroughbred\r\ntrotter? This question is already affirmatively answered when we say the\r\nrule “applies to all the varieties of our domestic animals.” This is\r\nthe general fact, but the trotting horse has a qualification, already\r\ndetermined, that serves as a fixed starting point in giving him rank. The\r\nstandard as originally adopted and honestly administered was the mighty\r\nengine that wrought the revolution in breeding the trotter. It fixed a\r\ncertain qualification that had to be complied with before an animal could\r\nbe admitted to standard rank, and that qualification was in brief to\r\neither perform or produce a performer that could cover a mile in 2:30.\r\nIt excluded no strains of blood, but it admitted the animals only that\r\nhad fully demonstrated the ability to trot or to produce trotters. The\r\nstandard is now antiquated, and far behind the speed of the trotters,\r\nwhich is a clear demonstration of the wisdom of its construction and\r\nadoption, but to this topic I will refer at another place more at length.\r\nWith the standard, then, and the unmistakable evidence it furnished of\r\nthe possession of what we will call “trotting blood,” we have a more\r\ndefinite and satisfactory starting point than can be claimed for any\r\nkind or variety of domestic animal. With this demonstrated ability to\r\ntrot fully established, we can commence to count the generations of\r\nstandard animals in a trotting pedigree, and if we find five generations\r\nof ancestors, with every animal standard bred, we can safely and\r\nintelligently say the animal is “thoroughly bred” as a trotting horse.\r\nWith those sixty-two progenitors all legally established as standard\r\nanimals, who will say this is not a thoroughbred trotting horse? He\r\nis not only thoroughbred, but he is more distinctly and completely\r\nthoroughbred than any other domestic animal, because the fifth generation\r\nof his ancestors, and the fourth and the third and the second and the\r\nfirst have all proved that they are either trotters or the producers\r\nof trotters. No other breed has ever been established on so good a\r\nfoundation, for they have fairly won their initial honors by what they\r\nhave done. But this is one degree higher and embraces one generation\r\nmore than the formula usually prescribed as necessary to constitute the\r\nrank of thoroughbred. Five “generations of ancestors” do not include the\r\nrepresentative product of those generations. The product would be the\r\nsixth generation, which is one more than the generally accepted usage\r\nrequires. An animal representing five generations of standard trotting\r\nblood, complete and without contamination, is “thoroughly bred” and is\r\njustly entitled to be classified as a “thoroughbred trotting horse.” At\r\nthis point of breeding it is considered that the danger of reversion is\r\npractically eliminated, and hence this distinctive classification. At the\r\ntime of this writing (1897) there should be, in this country, quite a\r\nnumber of youngsters fully entitled to rank as thoroughbreds.\r\n\r\nAll intelligent breeders have long been aiming at this point, not merely\r\nfor the name “thoroughbred,” but for the greater certainty of uniformity\r\nin producing what they want—the ability to perform; and the quality\r\nof these thoroughbred trotters must be determined by the ability to\r\nperform and the quality of each and every one of the ancestors. If each\r\nand every one of the four or five generations of ancestors was able to\r\ngo out and win himself or herself, there could hardly be a doubt that\r\nthe colt could do the same, but some of those ancestors may be in the\r\nstandard merely from reflected honors, which are good, but not a crucial\r\ntest of superiority in the individual. There is nothing like the animal\r\nthat “has gone out and done it” himself, over and over again, and when\r\nwe sit down to the study and comparison of pedigrees in the thoroughbred\r\nrank we find great differences in the quality of the lines of descent.\r\nThe reflected honors of an uncle or an aunt are of much less value than\r\nthe honor of a direct ancestor. While the blood of all the ancestors is\r\ntested blood, the individuals may not all have been tested, and hence\r\nare less certain in transmitting the true trotting instinct. While the\r\nstandard has done wonders in teaching the true art of breeding, like\r\nall other human devices it has its imperfections. Just like the runner,\r\nthe trotter may be strictly thoroughbred, and yet in taking after some\r\nof the imperfections of one or more of his ancestors, he may be of but\r\nlittle value as a performer. This truth has been verified in a thousand\r\nexperiences in the runner, and it is just as liable to be verified in the\r\ntrotter. Hence the supreme importance of looking well to the qualities\r\nand capacities of every animal in the inheritance.\r\n\r\nAt the very inception of the idea that the trotting horse could be bred\r\nand developed into a breed, an opinion prevailed everywhere that it\r\ncould not be done. The theory that speed at the trot came from speed at\r\nthe gallop was universally held and advocated. In 1868 I made a tour\r\namong the breeders and horsemen of Tennessee and Kentucky, for the\r\npurpose of gathering information about both runners and trotters. Those\r\nStates were then beginning to pull themselves together after the war.\r\nAt General Harding’s, among others, I was shown a large, heavy-boned\r\ncolt, and the General remarked that if he did not make a race horse he\r\nwould make a capital stallion to take to the West and breed on trotting\r\nmares. At Balie Peyton’s I was shown a great big, coarse horse that had\r\nrun some races and won in very slow time, and that was unsound at many\r\npoints. He was over sixteen hands high, and had very bad limbs. Mr.\r\nPeyton remarked that “he was too big for a race horse, but he would do\r\nwell in the West as a trotting sire.” This was the remark everywhere as\r\napplied to big colts that couldn’t run. About the same time Mr. Joseph\r\nCairn Simpson, then in the employ of a sporting paper in New York, as an\r\neditorial writer, expressed his sorrow that Hambletonian did not have a\r\nthoroughbred cross, close up, and his opinion that such a cross would\r\nhave made him a much greater sire. Thus, East and West, North and South,\r\nthe opinion prevailed everywhere that the way to breed the trotter was\r\nto go to the runner. This universal belief, wholly without foundation,\r\nsoon generated the cry, “more running blood in the trotter,” and the\r\ninstincts of all the rogues in the country were quickened to make their\r\npedigrees conform to the popular belief of what was best. This resulted\r\nin a period of fictitious claims, for when a man had a colt out of a\r\nmare of unknown breeding the rule was to say, “dam thoroughbred,” and\r\nif the owner was unusually conscientious and knew the breeding for one\r\nor two crosses, he would give them correctly, but seldom failed to\r\ntack on two or three thoroughbred crosses that were wholly fictitious.\r\nAfter all my years of experience with the pedigrees of horses, it is my\r\ndeliberate and candid opinion that no word in the English language has\r\nbeen so much abused as the word “thoroughbred.” It has been the medium\r\nof more deceptions and downright falsehoods than any other word in the\r\nvocabulary. For many years it was the word above all other words that the\r\nunscrupulous jockey employed to defraud his inexperienced victim. And if\r\nthere had been no strong hand to take the improper and dishonest use of\r\nthe word by the throat there would be no breed of trotters, and the whole\r\nbusiness of breeding and developing the trotting horse would be to-day\r\njust where it was thirty years ago. The old, threadbare stock argument\r\nwas in everybody’s mouth, to the effect that “Messenger was an English\r\nthoroughbred and he founded a family of trotters, hence any other English\r\nthoroughbred could do the same thing under the same circumstances.” When\r\nthis ancient formula was submitted to the test it was found to be fatally\r\nunsound at both ends, as has been shown in another chapter. Messenger\r\nwas found to be far short of being thoroughbred in his inheritance;\r\nforty other English thoroughbreds had been in competition with him and\r\nbred upon the same mares, yet no other English thoroughbred, in the\r\nexperiences of a hundred and fifty years, ever founded a family of\r\ntrotters. The two ablest advocates of “more running blood in the trotter”\r\nthat this country has produced, Mr. Charles J. Foster and Mr. Joseph\r\nCairn Simpson, when challenged to produce an English thoroughbred horse\r\nthat had founded a family of trotters, conceded the whole contention by\r\nnaming Bishop’s Hambletonian and Mambrino, both sons of Messenger and\r\nthe principal channels through which Messenger had founded his family\r\nof trotters. This knocked all the noise out of the famous formula, and\r\ninstead of the braying of an ass we have heard nothing since on this\r\nsubject but an occasional and very feeble squeak of a mouse.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier portion of the period when the American Trotter was\r\nbeginning to assume the shape and character of a breed, the term\r\n“thoroughbred,” meaning English racing blood, was adhered to with\r\nastonishing tenacity, as an indispensable element in the breeding of the\r\ntrotter. A few men of clear and independent minds commenced to study\r\nthe question in the light of experiences, and they were not long in\r\nreaching the truth; but, as a rule, the less a man knew of the question,\r\nwhether a breeder or a writer, the more blatant and vociferous he was\r\nin maintaining that all trotters were dependent for their speed on the\r\nblood of the “thoroughbred English race horse.” When Maud S. made her\r\nfour-year-old record and astonished the world, the acclamations of this\r\nclass went up in tremendous volume pointing to the Boston blood of her\r\ngrandam as the element that did it. Now, it never has been shown, and it\r\nnever can be shown, that there was a single drop of Boston’s blood in\r\nher veins. Besides all this, Boston was not a thoroughbred horse, for\r\nneither his sire nor his grandam was thoroughbred. A curious phase of\r\nthe interest attached to the mere word “thoroughbred” was brought out\r\nby a Catholic priest, in New Jersey, in a very cranky and ill-natured\r\nletter addressed to the editor of _Wallace’s Monthly_ protesting against\r\nthe frequent use of the term “running-bred” instead of “thoroughbred.”\r\nPriests are generally educated men, but this poor man struck out into a\r\nfield where he was entirely ignorant. A horse with two or three immediate\r\nand direct running crosses may be properly and truthfully called “running\r\nbred,” because that blood predominates in his veins, but to be justly\r\nand truthfully called “thoroughly bred” he must have at least five\r\ndirect and distinct crosses, and each and every one of them pure and\r\nwithout any contamination from any other blood. As an illustration of\r\nwhat results from this definition of the word “thoroughbred,” we may\r\ntake the very cream of our old American racing families and not one in\r\nfifty is “thoroughly bred.” American Eclipse was far short of being\r\nthoroughbred, even if we admit that Messenger was thoroughbred. Timoleon,\r\nthe greatest son of Sir Archy, had an impossible and untruthful pedigree\r\non the side of his dam. His great son Boston was short and deficient on\r\nboth sides, and with these taints how could he get the great blind horse\r\nLexington and make him a thoroughbred? These horses were distinctively\r\n“running bred,” but not technically “thoroughbred.” It is not to be\r\npresumed the priest was angry because I preferred not to use a word that\r\nconveyed an untruth and to use one that told the exact truth, for he was\r\nnot qualified to judge which was true and which was not true, but like\r\nhundreds of others he feared the value of his property might be affected\r\nby the refusal to apply the term “thoroughbred” to some supposable cross\r\nin some of his pedigrees.\r\n\r\n“More running blood in the trotter” was a “fad” that has been completely\r\nextinguished by all the experiences of later years. It was a freak that\r\nnever had any foundation either in nature or in reason. No animal can\r\ntransmit to his posterity qualities and capacities which he has not\r\ninherited, or which he does not possess by acquirement. This is a rule\r\nwhich seems to be perfectly plain to the comprehension of everybody, and\r\nin observation and experience it proves itself true every day of the\r\nyear. To breed a horse that can go fast at the trotting or pacing gait\r\nwe must go to the horse and the blood that has gone fast at one or the\r\nother of these gaits. It seems like a needless work to expend any time\r\nor space on what is self-evident in all human experiences. A few years\r\nago I offered a money reward, of sufficient amount to justify some labor\r\nin a search, to any one who would report to me any thoroughbred running\r\nhorse, with the proofs, that had ever made a trotting record of a mile in\r\nthree minutes, and there was no response. Some years later I renewed the\r\noffer, doubling the amount of the former offer, and still there came no\r\nresponse. I regret now that I did not make the offer for a mile in four\r\nminutes instead of three, for I very much doubt whether there ever was a\r\nthoroughbred horse able to trot a mile in four minutes. What is the use,\r\nthen, of giving further attention to the consideration of the value of\r\nthoroughbred running blood in the trotter?\r\n\r\nBut after conceding that the instinct to stick to the trot and the step\r\nof the trotter must come from the trotter, the advocates of “more running\r\nblood in the trotter” plant all their heavy guns on the proposition that\r\nrunning blood is needed to give the trotter more courage, endurance,\r\nand beauty of form. In all the past years we have had so many grand\r\npanegyrics on the will power and undying courage of the “courser of\r\nthe desert” that they have become threadbare and have an “ancient and\r\nfish-like smell,” and we would prefer to exchange them for something\r\nmore recent and practical. When we go to a race meeting and see so many\r\ncontests at various distances less than a mile, a few at something over\r\na mile, and all these merely single dashes, we naturally and justly\r\nconclude that the distance of ground to be covered in each contest is\r\nadjusted to the courage and stamina of the racers. I cannot conceive of\r\nany fairer criterion by which to determine the measure of gameness and\r\npluck of running horses than simply to consider the distance chosen, and\r\nthat for a single dash. Trainers and owners know just where each horse\r\nwill quit, if hard pressed, and they will not enter him in any distance\r\nbeyond the point where they know his courage will fail. With the data of\r\ndistances for these single dashes already fixed for the accommodation of\r\nhorses with different degrees of staying qualities, and after making a\r\nliberal allowance for age and lack of condition, we seem to have a solid\r\nfoundation for a safe conclusion that the crucial test of the speed of\r\nthe average race horse fails him before he reaches the first mile-post.\r\n\r\nWhen the trotter starts out for his summer’s campaign he has no choice\r\nas to the length of his races, and he is not looking about for single\r\ndashes of four, five, six or seven furlongs, but enters the field\r\nboldly and throws down the glove to all the best strains of trotting\r\nand pacing blood. Every race will be mile heats, best two in three or\r\nthree in five, and it often requires six, seven or eight heats before\r\nthe victor is declared. This experience is repeated, week after week,\r\nduring the whole season. Such a weekly experience as this, continued\r\nthrough twenty consecutive weeks, would probably destroy the best and\r\nstoutest running horse now living. This is the test to which the trotter\r\nis subjected, and no man can say it lacks in severity in determining his\r\nqualities as a race horse, in his stamina, his courage and his gameness.\r\nIn touching this point I will here take the liberty of entering my\r\nprotest against what I consider the unnecessary severity of this test. We\r\nwant all these tests, and from the standpoint of the breeder we cannot\r\nprogress without them, but we want them to stop short of injury to the\r\nanimal. When a contest is drawn out to six, eight or ten heats, it not\r\nonly becomes cruel as a sport, but it is liable to inflict irreparable\r\ninjury to the soundness of the animal. Unsoundness, either external or\r\ninternal, is liable to result from all such abuses. This is a dominant\r\nfact, and while we may not be able to see the injury with the eye, we\r\nare likely to see the evil results in the progeny. Animals of the kind\r\nmost likely to be subjected to this over-severity of test are the hope\r\nof the future as producers, and by all means wise and possible we should\r\nseek to preserve them in their pristine soundness and vigor. As breeders\r\nwe cannot afford to let them go without development and test, neither\r\ncan we afford to impair or destroy their producing qualities, in the\r\ntest. This can be done only by shortening the race; not the distance of\r\nground, but the number of heats that can be trotted. With an inflexible\r\nrule that not more than five heats should be trotted in any race, and\r\nthat at the conclusion of the fifth heat the money should be divided\r\naccording to the places of the contestants, I would not be particular as\r\nto whether the race was for the best two in three, or the best three in\r\nfive. The invariable results have been that in long-drawn-out contests\r\nof many heats there have been bargains and combinations for or against\r\ncertain horses, and all managed by and in the interest of the so-called\r\n“speculators.” If this were done the combinations of the gamblers would\r\nbe checkmated, the cruelty of the sport would be eliminated, and our best\r\nhorses would come through the campaigns ready and fit to propagate their\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn breeding for a particular purpose or qualification all experience\r\ngoes to show that the elements entering into the new creature must be\r\ncarefully selected as possessing the quality that we seek to propagate.\r\nNobody would think of breeding a running mare to a trotting horse if\r\nhe was seeking to breed a running colt. No thoughtful and intelligent\r\nman would think of breeding a running horse upon a trotting mare if he\r\nwere seeking to breed a trotting colt. The runner to the runner and the\r\ntrotter to the trotter has been demonstrated ten thousand times as the\r\nright way. The cross-bred or half-and-half-bred animal may be something\r\nof a trotter or something of a runner, doing neither well; and this\r\nuncertainty never can become a certainty as to which it may be till\r\nyou try him. The evil of half-and-half breeding does not cease with\r\nthe life of the animal, for the division in his own inheritance will\r\nmanifest itself in his progeny for generations, or till it is bred out.\r\nBut, strange as it may seem, there are still a few old men living who,\r\nfrom pride of opinion advanced in their younger days, still maintain\r\nthat trotting speed must come from the “thoroughbred” and “point with\r\npride” to the great horse Palo Alto as the complete illustration of\r\ntheir belief. In relation to the breeding of Palo Alto I will here tell\r\na little story, premising that I neither accept it as true nor reject it\r\nas false, for I know nothing about it. The late Mr. William H. Wilson,\r\nof Cynthiana, Kentucky, was in many respects a remarkable man. He was\r\nfull of energy and push, and his brain seemed to teem with formidable\r\nideas, chiefly relating to his prospects, and the management of his own\r\nbusiness. He was intelligent in horse matters, and very well informed\r\non local horse history. He did a great deal of work for me in the way\r\nof straightening out tangled skeins, and in tracing obscure pedigrees.\r\nIn this way I came to know Mr. Wilson very well, and as I never found\r\nhim wrong on these questions I came to place great confidence in his\r\nword and his judgment in all pedigree matters that he had investigated.\r\nSome time about 1889, probably, he asked me to investigate the pedigree\r\nof Dame Winnie, the dam of Palo Alto, for, he said, he had every reason\r\nto believe she was not by Planet, but by a trotting-bred horse that\r\nhe named, but that name has escaped me. I replied that I had not time\r\nthen, but I would think about it. Some months afterward he was again\r\nin my office and he again urged the investigation. My reply was that\r\nthere were some very upright and honest men in Kentucky as well as some\r\ngreat rogues, and if I were to undertake to investigate this pedigree\r\nthe rogues could get forty men, if so many were necessary, for a bottle\r\nof whisky or a half-dollar a head, who could remember just what it was\r\nnecessary to remember, and forget just what it was necessary to forget\r\nin order to prove that the mare was by Planet. I recalled my experience\r\nwith suborned evidence in the past, and knew just what I might expect\r\nin the future, and so I had concluded to make no more investigations in\r\ncertain portions of Kentucky until I had an opportunity to cross-examine\r\nthe witnesses. Dame Winnie was a plain, common-looking mare, with\r\nnothing about her to indicate high breeding, and if we lay aside Mr.\r\nWilson’s story and accept the pedigree as usually given she was strongly\r\nrunning bred, but at several points in her pedigree she fails of being\r\nthoroughbred. The internal evidence as to the breeding of this mare,\r\nbrought to light in the performance of her produce, suggests very\r\nstrongly the probability that she possessed some trotting blood, from\r\nsome source not far removed. She has five representatives in the 2:30\r\nlist, and this of itself strongly supports Mr. Wilson’s untold story,\r\nthat I would not listen to. In passing I will say I would be glad to\r\nlisten to it now; for this solid foundation of experience is so stoutly\r\ncorroborative of what he suggested as to justify an effort to reach the\r\nexact truth. When it was known in Kentucky that Senator Stanford had sent\r\nhis representative down there to gather up a lot of “thoroughbred” mares\r\nfrom which to breed trotters in California, every dealer in the State had\r\njust what he wanted. He was looking for pedigrees, and it was a very easy\r\nmatter to shape up the pedigrees just to suit him.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the breeding of his dam, Palo Alto was a great\r\nhorse, but he came to his speed slowly, and this would seem to indicate\r\nthat if his dam had any trotting inheritance it was weak in the direction\r\nof attaining a high rate of speed. From the day he was weaned till the\r\nday he died he was Senator Stanford’s idol, and with this horse as an\r\nobject lesson he was going to teach the world how to breed the trotter.\r\nAt two years old he was driven a mile privately in 2:22¾, and his owner,\r\nfeeling that his dream was realized in breeding the greatest horse the\r\nworld had produced, named him “Palo Alto,” as he deemed him worthy of\r\nbeing at the head of the greatest breeding establishment of the world.\r\nHe was in the hands of the most skillful and careful of all trainers,\r\nand the training went on without respite, year after year. When four\r\nyears old he went through the Eastern circuits, winning the larger share\r\nof his purses, and making a record of 2:20¼. Now let us consider for a\r\nmoment whether the Senator did not make a great mistake and select the\r\nwrong horse as the typical representative of his great establishment. In\r\n1888 he bred a colt by Electioneer out of Lula Wilkes, grandam the famous\r\ntrotting mare Lula, 2:15, by Norman, etc., intensely trotting bred, and\r\nwhen he was three years old he made a record of 2:16. This is better than\r\n2:20¼ as a four-year-old, for this fellow had not to take one-half the\r\ntraining that Palo Alto was subjected to. The next year he bred another\r\ncolt by Electioneer called Arion, out of a mare by Nutwood; she out of a\r\nsister to Voltaire, 2:20¼, by Tattler, 2:26; and she out of the famous\r\ntrotting brood mare Young Portia, by Mambrino Chief; and the next dam\r\nPortia by the pacer Roebuck. This colt came out and trotted a mile in\r\n2:10¾ as a two-year-old. The four-year-old had a great “boom” and was\r\nconsidered by many as the phenomenal colt of his year, but when we place\r\nhis record of 2:20¼ beside the 2:16 of the three-year-old, it looks very\r\nsickly, and when we compare it with the 2:10¾ of the two-year-old it is\r\nshaded into a deathly pallor. The four-year-old is largely the result of\r\nskill and art; the two-year-old is the result of nature. Arion is the\r\nbest horse, by the record, that the world has ever produced, and the\r\nSenator was mistaken in his dream. We must judge of the value of a fast\r\nperformance by the degree of naturalness which it represents and the\r\nmeasure of its freedom from the arts of the trainer. The “born trotter”\r\nis what we want, and at two years old Arion, or any other colt, was at\r\nthe right age to determine whether a fast performance was the result of\r\nnature or of art.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact well known to everybody that some trotting-bred stallions\r\nhave shown greater power in controlling the action of their progeny than\r\nothers that seemed to be equally well bred. If out of the great mass of\r\nstallions, past and present, that have been more or less successful as\r\ntrotting progenitors, we pick out thirty of the very best, as shown by\r\ntheir progeny, it will probably surprise many of my readers to learn\r\nthat only three of that number have been able to triumph in the supreme\r\ntest of getting trotters out of running-bred mares. Of these three\r\nElectioneer stands first, Almont second, and Pilot Jr. third. After\r\nmaking all allowance for the anxiety of certain Californians and certain\r\nKentuckians to prove the need of “more running blood in the trotter,”\r\nand their manifest willingness to help along with pedigrees in that\r\ndirection, I am fully convinced that these three horses, in some cases,\r\nwere able to meet and overcome the hostile elements of the galloper.\r\nNot in every case, certainly, nor in a majority of cases. When Senator\r\nStanford was showing me the step of Palo Alto, on his own track, as\r\na three-year-old, I remarked, “Well, Electioneer certainly triumphed\r\nin that case,” and the Senator replied, “Yes, but none of my other\r\nstallions can do it, and there are some thoroughbred mares upon which\r\nElectioneer can’t do it.” When approached by others on this subject in\r\nthe riper years of his experience, he was in the habit of replying:\r\n“There are thoroughbreds and thoroughbreds; some of them will produce\r\ntrotters to Electioneer, and some will not.” He accepted everything\r\nas thoroughbred that had been bought by his agents as thoroughbred,\r\nwhether in Kentucky or California, and he claimed to be able to pick out\r\nthose that would produce trotters by their appearance. When pressed to\r\ngive the characteristics by which he was able to make his selections,\r\nhe spoke of the shape of the animal, in a general way, and especially\r\nby the head and the expression of countenance. In selecting his mares\r\nto put in the trotting stud by their “appearance” he would naturally\r\nselect such as had the “appearance” of trotters, and as he personally\r\nknew no more about their pedigrees or the inheritance of the animals\r\nthan the mares knew themselves, he was very liable to be deceived in\r\nthe breeding of the animals as he selected them. In selecting a mare by\r\n“appearance” as indicating that she might throw trotters to Electioneer,\r\nthere is a strong suggestion that this “appearance” may have been a\r\nlegitimate “inheritance” sought to be covered up by that sadly abused\r\nterm “thoroughbred.” Whether this suggestion ever entered the Senator’s\r\nmind I have no means of determining. But whether some of the mares called\r\n“thoroughbred” had really a mixed inheritance or not, the fact remains\r\nthat the three horses named above did succeed in getting some trotters\r\nfrom mares that were strongly running bred. Then the question arises: Why\r\ndid these three horses succeed where all others failed? We are not able\r\nto give an answer to this question that is complete and irrefutable,\r\nfor there is so much in the laws of generation that we do not and cannot\r\nknow. Take two brothers, for example, and one is a great success and the\r\nother a great failure, and often the failure is the better formed and\r\nthe better looking horse of the two. All that science teaches us here is\r\nthat one took after some ancestor, near or remote, that was good, and\r\nthe other after some ancestor that was not good. Electioneer, Almont\r\nand Pilot Jr. all had short pedigrees composed exclusively of trotting\r\nand pacing blood, except possibly a few drops of running blood that may\r\nhave trickled down from the runner through trotting or pacing channels.\r\nTheir instincts to stick to the trot had been encouraged and more or\r\nless completely developed. Electioneer and Almont both had pacing blood\r\nsome distance away, and Pilot Jr., so far as we know, had nothing but\r\npacing blood, and yet he never paced a step in his life. This embraces\r\nall we know of the three horses that proved themselves the most prepotent\r\nin overcoming all antagonisms of race or blood. Others equally great,\r\nno doubt, have come up since their day, but as breeding is now better\r\nunderstood and as the laws of nature are now more carefully followed,\r\ntests of this kind are not often made.\r\n\r\nAfter all the “wiring in and wiring out” of the tortuous advocates of\r\n“more running blood in the trotter” had found that their efforts had\r\nborne no fruit and that all intelligent breeders had left their theories\r\naway behind, a remarkably brilliant genius struck out a new line of\r\nthought and argument, which unfortunately died “a bornin’” just as\r\nthe attention of all intelligent breeders was turning away from “more\r\nrunning blood in the trotter” as a senseless “fad,” and looking to the\r\npacer as a possible source of increased trotting speed. In formulating\r\nand exploiting his idea, our genius seems to have reasoned after this\r\nmanner: “The crisis is here, the breeders are all turning away from the\r\nthoroughbred as a source of trotting speed and considering the pacer, and\r\nnow if I can convince them that the pacer is at least half-thoroughbred\r\nI will beat the standard and win the day.” Here we have the motive and\r\nthe subject, and now we are ready for the manipulation. In due time\r\nthe article appeared, and I must do the writer the justice of saying\r\nI never have been fully satisfied that he believed a single word of\r\nit himself. He starts out to show that the pace is not the result of\r\nhereditary transmission but the result of “structural incongruity.” He\r\ndeclared that this “structural incongruity” is the result of breeding\r\nthe thoroughbred horse on the slab-sided, ill-shapen mares of the West\r\nand Southwest. From the inheritance, part of the animal is structurally\r\nformed to run and the other part structurally formed to trot, and\r\nbetween the two a compromise is made on the pace. In this “structural\r\nincongruity,” between the two parts the pacing gait originated, and hence\r\nwhatever speed the pacer may possess comes from the “thoroughbred;” and,\r\ntherefore, of necessity, whatever speed the trotter gets from the pacer\r\ncomes from the “thoroughbred.” There are many humbugs in the literature\r\nof the horse, but this is the craziest humbug I have ever met with.\r\nWhat a pity he left his work unfinished, and failed to tell us which\r\nend of the horse was running bred and which end trotting bred, so that\r\nwe might locate the “incongruity” and cut it out! But to look at this\r\n“structural incongruity” seriously, it lacks but little of a scandal on\r\nthe intelligence and honesty of American writers on the horse. Here is\r\na gentleman of reputed intelligence, who wields a facile pen and has\r\nbeen writing on breeding subjects for about thirty years, and much of\r\nhis work was well done; and now at the close of the nineteenth century\r\nhe undertakes to tell us how the pacer originated in this country. The\r\nveriest tyro in horse history knows that pacers abounded in England in\r\nthe twelfth century, and indeed long before that. Every colony in this\r\ncountry was full of pacers a hundred years before the first thoroughbred\r\ncrossed the Atlantic. But wild and absurd theories can safely be left to\r\nthe public judgment.\r\n\r\nIt required several years of labor and iteration to convince the breeding\r\npublic that the trot and the pace were simply two forms of one and the\r\nsame gait. When first advanced it was received by the more intelligent\r\nbreeders as an abstraction that had nothing practical in it, while those\r\nof less ability to think for themselves only laughed at it. Since then\r\nthe inevitable processes of experience have demonstrated its truth,\r\nand the question of today is how to separate these two forms of the\r\nsame gait and to breed either form, as we may desire, as a distinct and\r\ncertainly transmissible gait. With a few it will still remain a matter of\r\nindifference whether the colt comes a pacer or a trotter, but with the\r\ngreat mass of breeders the question of profit in breeding the harness\r\nhorse must be considered. Everybody knows that in the market for road\r\nhorses the clean-stepping trotter is worth more than the smooth-gliding\r\npacer. This is not a question to be determined by fashion, but a fact\r\nof universal experience that the trotting action is better suited to\r\nharness and the pacing action better suited to the saddle. Fashions may\r\nchange, but these two facts are unchangeable, for they are founded in\r\nthe nature and mechanism of the two forms of action. The difficulties\r\nin the way of separating the diagonal from the lateral form of the trot\r\nare very great, and there is no use or wisdom in attempting to blink\r\nthis fact. Speed at both forms of the gait comes from the same source,\r\nthe same blood, the same inheritance; and source, blood and inheritance,\r\nin a breeding sense, are the hardest things in nature to overcome. So\r\nfar as experience teaches there is but one method or treatment that has\r\never been successful in wiping out the pacer. In the first half of the\r\nseventeenth century England was full of pacers, and about a hundred\r\nyears later she did not have one. The trouble about this remedy is that\r\nthe trotters were wiped out also, and today England has neither a pacer\r\nnor a trotter. When she now wants a trotter she has to send to this\r\ncountry and get some of the blood of the little despised pacer that was\r\nshipped from her own shores in the early colonial days. The blood of the\r\nSaracenic horse has not lost its potency as a pacing expunger, as shown\r\nby modern experiments, and all our breeders have to do is to use it in\r\ncopious effusions, and we will soon be rid of the pacer, and the trotter\r\nalong with him. The pacer and the trotter are never found separate from\r\neach other, so far as my information goes. In Russia they breed trotters\r\nmethodically, and they have a full supply of very fast pacers that are\r\nused as shaft horses in their droskies. As in the past, so in the future,\r\nwe never need expect to see the two forms of the gait entirely separated.\r\n\r\nOur people, however, are not ready, and as long as the horse is used for\r\nbusiness and pleasure never will be ready to dispense with the trotter;\r\nand even though some considerable number might deplore the presence and\r\nprominence of the pacer, every one of them would welcome him with great\r\njoy if they knew he was a necessary adjunct of the trotter. When we\r\nconsider the problem of reducing the ratio of pacers and increasing the\r\nratio of trotters in what we produce, there is so much that is old and\r\nstill imperfectly known in what we incorrectly call our “earlier” period\r\nof trotting that we find nothing encouraging in the study. The origin\r\nof the principal trotters of the early part of this century, except\r\nthe direct descendants of Messenger, was so sedulously concealed that\r\nit was entirely natural for so many men to conclude that the trotter\r\nwas not bred, but made by the trainer. When Flora Temple was the queen\r\nnobody knew that her speed came from a pacer. Old Kentucky Hunter was a\r\nvery fast pacer. When Pelham was king nobody knew he had been a pacer.\r\nWhen Highland Maid eclipsed all records nobody knew she was pacing bred\r\nand had been a pacer herself. When Vermont Black Hawk was the most\r\npopular sire of his day nobody knew that his dam was “Old Narragansett,”\r\na pacer. When Ethan Allen stood at the head of all young trotters the\r\nold grey mare, his dam, was, and still remains, entirely unknown, but\r\neverybody believes that a large share of his speed came from that mare.\r\nAndrew Jackson, the head of the great Clay family, was out of a fast\r\npacing mare. And thus we might extend the list indefinitely. But away\r\nback, more than a hundred years before the period of which we are here\r\nspeaking, pacing and trotting races had become so numerous that they had\r\nto be suppressed by legislative enactment. More than two hundred years\r\nago there were pacing races and trotting races in this country, and then\r\nas now it seems evident that the form of the action of the prospective\r\ncolt, whether lateral or diagonal, was uncertain until it appeared. This\r\ncondition of uncertainty about the secrets of the womb has existed for\r\ncenturies, as it exists today; and if we were furnished a complete list\r\nof all the great trotters of the last two decades that were born pacers\r\nwe would hardly be willing to believe our own senses. The following short\r\nlist of such animals as have gone fast at both forms of the gait will\r\nserve to illustrate the oneness of the two forms:\r\n\r\n                                           PACING.

The only remark that seems needed by way of\r\nexplanation is that all the animals named, except two (San Pedro and\r\nWardwell), made their records first as trotters.\r\n\r\nIn surveying the whole situation there is but little encouragement in\r\nattempting to solve the problem of how to reduce the ratio of the pacers\r\nand at the same time avoid the reduction of the speed of the trotters.\r\nThe central point in the problem is the development of speed; and so\r\nlong as the pacer comes to his speed so much quicker and easier than the\r\ntrotter, and so long as the best pacer is a little faster, as he has\r\nalways been, than the best trotter, there is no probability that his\r\nspeed will not be developed. All efforts at repression or exclusion of\r\nthe pacer from contesting for prizes at public meetings would be futile\r\nand, in a sense, unjust. Moreover, this would not be in the province of\r\nthe breeder and he must work out his plans within the boundaries of his\r\nown domain. The laws of heredity apply to either of the two forms of the\r\ntrot—the lateral and the diagonal—just as certainly as they apply to the\r\ntwo forms united. This is the breeder’s opportunity, and if he grasps it\r\nhe will make progress slowly but surely. In his breeding selections he\r\nmust lay it down as an inviolable rule that all pacers, especially pacers\r\nwith their speed developed, must be excluded, no difference how strongly\r\nthey may be bred in the best trotting lines. If a horse produces some\r\nfillies that, like Maud S., Sunol and hundreds of others, are halfway,\r\nor more than halfway, inclined to pace, he must rigorously keep them at\r\nthe trot and nothing but the trot, unless he sells them. He must study\r\nintelligently the pedigrees and produce of the generations away back,\r\nand make such selections as are most likely to promote his object and\r\nleast likely to violate the rule laid down. Of all the varieties of\r\nthe horse on the face of the globe the American trotter is the typical\r\nharness horse. Our civilization no longer requires the saddle to climb\r\nthrough mountain passes, and to follow seldom-trodden paths through the\r\nwilderness. For either business or pleasure we travel on wheels, and we\r\nwant the bold, bounding trotter to propel us. The pacer is the early and\r\nonly saddle horse in the world, but he is not a harness horse. Aside from\r\nthe few that will be used as gambling machines, his value will recede\r\nwhile that of the trotter will always advance. In the hands of a man of\r\nintelligent and fixed purpose it is certainly possible to breed a family\r\nof trotters in which the appearance of a pacer from birth would be of\r\nrare occurrence, and the longer such careful selections and purposes are\r\ncontinued the more rare will be the recurrence of the lateral habit of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThat the development of the speed of the parents was very important, if\r\nnot necessary to the increased speed of the progeny, was a proposition\r\nthat was long disputed. Generally, as on other questions, each man\r\nargued it from the standpoint of his own stable, but not a few men of\r\nclear minds took that side of the question without regard to the potency\r\nof the law of heredity. In the early stages of the discussion of this\r\nquestion it was a difficult one to handle effectively. At that time very\r\nfew sires, and still a less proportion of dams, had ever been regularly\r\ndeveloped as trotters, hence the field for generalization was narrow\r\nand many of the instances quoted were disputed. For a time the battle\r\nraged quite fiercely around Hambletonian, as he was the most prominent\r\nstallion of that period, and if a man was trying to build up another\r\nfamily he would rave till he got black in the face against “Bill Rysdyk’s\r\nbull.” It is but just to say that the man who led in all this froth and\r\nfury against Hambletonian was engaged in breeding what he called “Clay\r\nArabs,” and after dodging his creditors for a number of years his last\r\nhoof was sold from him by the sheriff. On the other hand, Hambletonian\r\nmade his master a rich man, and he left a large estate. Hambletonian was\r\nonly partially developed, but sufficient to show he was a fast colt for\r\nhis period. (For full particulars see his history in another chapter.)\r\nAbdallah was a very great sire of speed and he was not a developed\r\ntrotter, but his dam, old Amazonia, was quite fully developed. She won\r\nmany races and was the fastest trotter of her day. Whether her speed came\r\nfrom a fast pacing ancestry, or whether it came from the reputed “son of\r\nMessenger,” as stated when she was bought near Philadelphia, never can be\r\ndetermined. The “son of Messenger” story seemed to be straight, but her\r\nform was coarse and plain, and her legs were so hairy that many who knew\r\nher best condemned the story; hence, all we can say about her is simply\r\nthat she was a fast developed trotter. Andrew Jackson had but little\r\ntrotting inheritance from his sire, and his dam was a fast pacing mare of\r\nunknown breeding, but his speed was very fully developed as a trotter,\r\nand he became the progenitor of the Clay and the Long Island Black Hawk\r\nfamilies, that became famous in trotting history. While this reasoning\r\nwas true in experience and sound under the canons of science, it was not\r\nstrong and convincing, for the one and only reason that the basis of the\r\ngeneralization was too narrow and lacked in a sufficient number of cases\r\nto convince the understanding of the skeptical. We have had to wait for\r\nthe accumulation of the experiences of a number of years, and now we have\r\nthe evidence that is so complete as to be really startling and which no\r\nman can gainsay. The following little table embraces all the breeding\r\nfarms in this country that have produced three or more trotters with\r\nrecords of 2:15 or better, and here the rate of speed is certainly high\r\nenough and the foundation is certainly broad enough to furnish just and\r\nsafe conclusions:\r\n\r\n  Leland Stanford             18\r\n  Fashion Stud Farm           13\r\n  William Corbitt              9\r\n  Wm. H. Wilson                8\r\n  C. J. Hamlin                 7\r\n  Glenview Farm                6\r\n  Timothy Anglin               5\r\n  Henry C. Jewett              4\r\n  Wm. C. France                4\r\n  Woodburn Farm                4\r\n  Robert G. Stoner             4\r\n  R. S. Veech                  3\r\n  C. W. Williams               3\r\n  Highland Farm (Lee, Mass.)   3\r\n  Fairlawn Farm                3\r\n  E. W. Ayers                  3\r\n  Charles Backman              3\r\n  George H. Ely                3\r\n  Mrs. S. L. Stout             3\r\n  Monroe Salisbury             3\r\n\r\nQuite a number of other breeders have produced one or two that have made\r\nrecords in 2:15 or better, but I think the above list embraces all that\r\nhave bred three or more with trotting records of 2:15 or better. The\r\ntable will be a surprise to everybody, but I doubt whether it will be a\r\ngreater surprise to anybody than it is to myself. At the head of the list\r\nstands the late Senator Stanford’s great establishment with eighteen to\r\nits credit, but this is not a fair basis of comparison with any other\r\nestablishment in the whole country, for he had about three hundred mares\r\nin the trotting department of his breeding stud—about six times as large\r\nas the average of the larger studs of the country. The average number\r\nof horses in training, the year round, was about eighty, exclusive of\r\nyearlings and the kindergarten. In attempting to institute a comparison,\r\ntherefore, with the average breeders of the country, we might as well\r\ncompare the daily receipts of John Wanamaker’s store with those of the\r\nlittle green-grocer on the corner. But at the head of this establishment\r\nstood the great Electioneer with his strong breeding and trotting speed\r\nwell developed, and indeed, in many respects the greatest horse of his\r\ngeneration. He was the sire of eleven in the list, and the remainder were\r\neither by his sons or out of his daughters.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry N. Smith, of New York, a prominent Wall Street man, became\r\ngreatly interested in trotting sport, and in 1868 he organized a trotting\r\nstable of his own, which contained some remarkable animals, as will be\r\nseen below. His stable was very successful, and this success naturally\r\nincreased his attachment to the trotting interests. He then determined\r\nto establish a breeding farm, and about the year 1869 he purchased the\r\nfamous old Fashion Course adjoining Trenton, New Jersey, embracing one\r\nhundred and forty-five acres of land and provided with an excellent\r\nmile track and much stabling that had been constructed years before for\r\nrunning horses. This property he very appropriately named the “Fashion\r\nStud Farm,” and on it he placed the grandest assemblage of developed\r\ntrotters, for breeding purposes only, that had ever been brought together\r\nin this or any other country. His stallions were Jay Gould, 2:20½,\r\nTattler, 2:26, and Gen. Knox, 2:31½. This was Knox’s fastest record, but\r\nit was known he had trotted miles, in races, faster than this. The speed\r\nof all three horses was developed, and it is evident at a glance that\r\nthere was only one first-class horse among them. But the great strength\r\nof the establishment was in the grand galaxy of mares, some of which I\r\nwill enumerate, namely. Goldsmith Maid, 2:14, Lady Thorn, 2:18¼, Lucy,\r\n2:18¼, Lady Maud, 2:18¼, Rosalind, 2:21¾, Belle Strickland, 2:26, Western\r\nGirl, 2:27, Idol, 2:27, Big Mary, 2:28½, Daisy Burns, 2:28, Music’s Dam\r\n(that had produced 2:21½ speed), besides others with slower records or\r\nknown to have had their speed developed as fast road mares, making in all\r\nabout thirty mares on the farm, and Mr. Smith claimed that every one of\r\nthem had shown more or less speed as trotters.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith neither knew nor cared much about pedigrees, in a general\r\nsense, and when you came to talk to him about “nicks” and “trotting\r\npitch” and all that kind of tomfoolery, his mind simply recurred to\r\nthe old adage uttered generations ago: “Trot father, trot mother, trot\r\ncolt.” His whole philosophy was wrapped up in the one central truth that\r\nthe horse that could go out and trot fast, when bred on the mare that\r\ncould go out and trot fast, would produce a colt that would go out and\r\ntrot fast. This was sufficient for him or indeed for anybody else, for\r\nit contains and expresses the whole substance of the laws of heredity.\r\nMr. Smith’s great mares acquired in their training and development new\r\ncharacters and new capacities which they never would have possessed had\r\nit not been for the care and skill expended in their training. Here we\r\ntouch the very marrow of a question around which the scientists of today\r\nare warring. Darwin taught that such acquisitions were transmissible,\r\nof the truth of which I have no doubt, but a post-Darwinian school has\r\narisen which controverts this position, and claims that it weakens and\r\ndestroys the whole evolution theory of creation. But it matters not\r\nabout the hypothesis of evolution concerning things we know, for it\r\nis simply an attempt to show how all things might have been created\r\nwithout a Creator. I have read a great deal about evolution and the\r\ntransmissibility of acquired characters, but in all I have read I never\r\nhave met with a lesson so broad and so strong as that furnished by Henry\r\nN. Smith’s great mares, proving that acquired characters are transmitted.\r\n\r\nIn instituting a comparison between the high-class products of the Palo\r\nAlto and the Fashion Stud Farms, it seems to be necessary to place the\r\npremier stallions of the two side and side. They were half-brothers on\r\nthe side of the sire, but Electioneer had the greatest speed-producing\r\ndam of her generation. She was a fast natural trotter herself, and was\r\nout of a fast and fully developed trotter. Jay Gould was out of a good\r\nroad mare by American Star, but nobody has ever said she had any speed,\r\nand she was out of a nondescript mare that we know nothing about. Gould’s\r\ndam never produced any other trotter with a reputable rate of speed, so\r\nfar as I have been able to learn. Electioneer was trained and developed\r\nby Mr. Backman, but he never was in a race, and consequently he has no\r\nofficial record. After he was taken to Palo Alto he was given quite\r\nregular work, and it is beyond all doubt that when in stud condition he\r\ncould show a quarter in a little better than a 2:20 gait. The difference\r\nin the rate of speed, therefore, as between the two horses was not very\r\ngreat, but whatever it was must go to the credit of Jay Gould. But the\r\noffspring of Electioneer had a very great advantage over those of Jay\r\nGould in the methodical and skillful development of their speed. In his\r\nmaternal inheritance as a trotter, as already indicated, Electioneer\r\nhad a marked superiority, and on an equally high class of developed\r\nmares he would have far outstripped his rival. Now, with this attempt\r\nat a clean-cut description of the two horses, we are ready to consider\r\nthe question in its arithmetical elements, and it will be found a plain\r\nquestion of “simple proportion” which anybody can solve in a minute, as\r\nfollows: “If the Fashion Stud Farm from thirty mares produced thirteen\r\ntrotters with public records of 2:15 or better, how many of equal\r\ncapacity should the Palo Alto Farm have produced from three hundred\r\nmares?” The answer is one hundred and thirty, but the facts, up to the\r\nclose of 1896, furnish us with the beggarly number of eighteen.\r\n\r\nThe grand assemblage of so many great trotters at the Fashion Stud Farm,\r\nand all for the purpose of breeding, was the subject of much comment\r\namong breeders from one end of the land to the other, and not a few\r\npronounced it all wrong and that it would be succeeded by failure. Mr.\r\nSmith lacked some of the elements that go toward making a man popular,\r\nand hence, in many cases, there was not much sympathy between him and\r\nhis brother breeders, but he held tenaciously to the central truth that\r\nthe way to breed high-class trotters was to mate high-class trotters.\r\nHis experience has clearly demonstrated the soundness of this canon of\r\nbreeding, and it has just as clearly demonstrated the unsoundness of\r\nthe notion that high-class trotters can be bred from animals that never\r\ntrotted and never could be made to trot. The law, as we have taught it\r\nfor years, has been vindicated, and that by experiences so wide and so\r\ncomplete that it can no longer be controverted. Mr. Smith has achieved a\r\ngreat honor, and as a producer of high-class speed he stands at the head\r\nof all American trotting-horse breeders.\r\n\r\nAs we have now considered a great triumph, with the causes that led up\r\nto it and the lesson it has taught, it seems to be in order to give an\r\nexample of a great failure and the causes which have produced it. For\r\nmore than forty years Woodburn Farm, in Kentucky, has been breeding\r\ntrotters, and up to the close of 1896 just four with records of 2:15\r\nor better have hailed from that great establishment. During all these\r\nyears, and until Palo Alto Farm was established, Woodburn was the largest\r\nestablishment in this country. With thousands of broad acres of the most\r\nproductive soil, with the possession and control of money without limit,\r\nand with the experiences of forty years in which to select and breed only\r\nto the best, it is the natural and reasonable expectation of everybody\r\ninterested in the question of breeding the trotter to look to Woodburn as\r\nleading all other establishments in the whole world in the production of\r\nfirst-class trotters. And what has Woodburn done? With her experiences\r\nof forty years, with all her broad acres and boundless wealth, up to the\r\nclose of 1896 she has produced just four trotters with records of 2:15\r\nor better. Instead of leading all others, she is at the wrong end of the\r\nprocession, and if we consider the proportional advantages involved, we\r\nfind that “all others,” little and big, are leading her. By referring to\r\nthe above list of breeders that have produced three or more with records\r\nof 2:15 or better, we find that Henry N. Smith has produced thirteen,\r\nthat William Corbett, from his little stud in California, has produced\r\nnine, and that the late William H. Wilson, of Cynthiana, Kentucky, from\r\nhis little band of mares, and without either broad acres or money, has\r\nproduced eight within the past twelve or fifteen years, and all except\r\none by the same horse. This places Mr. Wilson first among all Kentucky\r\nbreeders. In the short period of its existence Glenview Farm produced\r\nsix, and the quite unpretentious farmer, Mr. Timothy Anglin, produced\r\nfive; W. C. France and Colonel R. G. Stoner produced four each—the same\r\nnumber as Woodburn—but they did not require forty years to accomplish\r\nit. Thus the breeding world, with “the little fellows” on top, has\r\ngone away ahead and left Woodburn to mumble over her “tin cups,” and\r\nexult in the many triumphs she has won against the watch in 2:30. The\r\npolicy of Woodburn for years past seems to have been to hold the lead of\r\nKentucky breeders in the production of 2:30 trotters, and to this end\r\nthe youngsters are put in training in the early spring and kept at it\r\ntill the frosts come, when such of them as are sure to win are brought\r\nout and started against the watch, for a “tin cup,” and these are the\r\nvictories that Woodburn wins. Nobody has ever heard of Woodburn entering\r\na youngster in a stake where he would have to win on his merits. That\r\nwould be bringing him down to an equality with the colts of such people\r\nas William H. Wilson, Colonel R. G. Stoner, Farmer Timothy Anglin, and\r\nall the other “little fellows.” Woodburn has made a great deal of money\r\nout of these humbug tin-cup records, and as registration and the standard\r\nare now absolutely under the control of her manager, the 2:30-tin-cup\r\nstill remains the evidence of a fast trotter, worthy of standard rank.\r\nTrue, everybody nowadays laughs at the idea that 2:30, with the “tin\r\ncup,” is any evidence of even reputable speed, but as they have given a\r\ncertain kind of pre-eminence and made money in the past, the twins will\r\nnot be separated, but will hold their places just as long as the standard\r\nis under the present control.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief examination of the symptoms I think a safe diagnosis can\r\nbe made. The trouble seems to be twofold, or it may be said there are\r\ntwo troubles, either one of which is dangerous, but the two together may\r\nprove fatal in the end. It is a well-known fact in veterinary science\r\nthat there are certain diseases among horses that may be communicated to\r\nthe men who have them in charge. There is one disease, vulgarly called\r\n“big-head,” that comes creeping upon its victim before he is aware of its\r\nexistence or approach, and against the insidious steps of this destroyer\r\nthe manager at Woodburn should be affectionately warned. Sham records\r\nof 2:30 for standard rank are no longer welcomed with enthusiasm in\r\nthis country. The other trouble is not so much with the manager as with\r\nthe material which he manages, which seems to be affected with what may\r\nbe called “dry-rot.” This view of the non-productive character of the\r\nWoodburn breeding stock, when measured by first-class performers, seems\r\nto be borne out by the fact that the names of those gentlemen who have\r\ndepended most largely on Woodburn blood do not appear on the foregoing\r\nlist as the producers of first-class trotters. For about forty years\r\nthe fame of Woodburn as the greatest of all our breeding establishments\r\nhas been as wide as the boundaries of the nation. But notwithstanding\r\nthe weight and influence which great wealth and an unblemished name may\r\nhave secured, the records up to the close of the year 1896 have deposed\r\nher from the first rank as a breeder of trotting horses, and sent her\r\naway to the rear, where she now occupies her true place in the eighth\r\nrank. It is well known to everybody that, since the days of the first\r\nMr. Alexander, Woodburn has never entered a colt in a stake nor started\r\none against other people’s colts, prize or no prize. This air of assumed\r\nsuperiority is sought to be explained on high moral grounds against the\r\nevils of horse-racing. This is like the man who never tasted whisky for\r\nconscience’ sake, in view of the great evil it was doing in the world,\r\nand yet he was the chief owner in a large distillery. At the great local\r\nmeetings in Kentucky practically all the breeding establishments of that\r\nregion, except Woodburn, are represented in the stakes, and while they\r\nare being contested Woodburn will come in with a string of youngsters,\r\nbetween the heats, and win sham records in 2:30 for “tin cups.” Depending\r\non this kind of test and this kind of development, it is not remarkable\r\nthat all the small breeders of the State have left Woodburn in the rear.\r\nThis shining example of failure teaches unmistakably the necessity\r\nof honest and full development of breeding stock in order to produce\r\nhigh-class trotters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nHOW THE TROTTING HOUSE IS BRED (_Continued_).\r\n\r\n    Breeding the trotter intelligently an industry of modern\r\n    development—Plethora of turf papers, and their timidity of\r\n    the truth—The accepted theories, old and new—Failure of\r\n    the “thoroughbred blood in the trotter” idea—“Thoroughbred\r\n    foundations,” and the Register—“Like begets like,” the great\r\n    central truth—Long-continued efforts to breed trotters from\r\n    runners —New York the original source of supply of trotting\r\n    blood to all the States—Kentucky’s beginning in breeding\r\n    trotters—R.

In that short period this\r\ninterest has developed from practically nothing into a great national\r\nindustry that has placed this country in front of all the nations of the\r\nearth in the character, quality and speed of the light harness horse.\r\nIt is true we had the “raw material” out of which to build up this new\r\nbreed, and this had been in our possession we may say for generations,\r\nbut we didn’t know how to use it. There may be some apparent indelicacy\r\nin making the remark, but I think every intelligent man who is acquainted\r\nwith the subject will sustain me in saying that, had it not been for the\r\ncompilation of the “Trotting Register” and _Wallace’s Monthly_, with the\r\nfacts, statistics and reasonings which were developed through them, we\r\nwould know no more about the trotter today than we did thirty years ago.\r\nThe trotting horse, therefore, as we contemplate him in his position\r\nof superiority to all others of his kind, is simply the result of great\r\nlabor in collecting the facts and sound reasoning from the lessons taught\r\nby those facts. With all the facts placed in his hand, any breeder of\r\nintelligence, if he were honest, could not fail to reach the truth; but,\r\nunfortunately, all breeders have never learned to divest themselves of\r\ntheir prejudices, and to accept the plain teachings of the facts, just as\r\nthey are.\r\n\r\nTo be able to think intelligently and honestly and to reason soundly, is\r\nthe first requisite to success in breeding the trotter. It is a seeming\r\nparadox, but it is nevertheless true, that many men who are able to think\r\na little are not able to think honestly. It is easy to understand why a\r\nman may act dishonestly, for there is the hope of gain to impel him; but\r\nwhy he should think dishonestly is not so apparent. Let us illustrate\r\nthis matter of thinking dishonestly. On an occasion a correspondent asked\r\na breeding journal to give a list of the thoroughbred horses that had\r\nsired trotters. A list of horses, represented as thoroughbred in the\r\nreply, was given, embracing some ten or twelve, about half of which were\r\neither unknown or dependent upon the most flimsy kind of representation\r\nas to their blood. It is not with the actual misrepresentation of the\r\nblood of most of the animals named, but with the use that was made of the\r\nlist that I will now speak. After accepting the list as true and genuine,\r\nthe correspondent comes before the public with his conclusions. He shows\r\nthat these dozen performers from about as many horses made an average\r\nrecord of 2:24 and a fraction, and then triumphantly raises the question\r\nwhether any single trotting-bred sire can show as many performers with as\r\nlow an average record. Having satisfied himself that all the running-bred\r\nsires, real and imaginary, put together could more than equal any one\r\ntrotting-bred sire in the average high rate of speed, he reaches the\r\nprofound conclusion that the way to breed the trotter is to go to the\r\nrunner. This is a real and not an imaginary instance of a few years\r\nago. No doubt this man thought he was thinking when he reached this\r\nconclusion, and that he had solved the problem of breeding the trotter;\r\nbut, poor man, he was simply trying to advertise a half-and-half-bred\r\nstallion he had in his stable.\r\n\r\nI have no old scores to pay off against the breeding and sporting press,\r\nfor I generally managed to pay them off as we went along, and the triumph\r\nof the views I advanced and sustained has become sufficiently complete\r\nto satisfy the most fastidious. It seems to be a real misfortune that\r\nthere are so many weekly journals in this field and most of them leading\r\na precarious existence. It may be observed in most directions that the\r\nmanagement of these journals is hesitating and timid, as though afraid\r\nthat somebody might be offended and a five or ten-dollar advertisement\r\nlost thereby. It is all right to make the advertising patronage\r\nremunerative, but it is all wrong when that department is placed in\r\ncontrol of all the others, from the fear that somebody may be offended\r\nif the truth be told. In the present depressed condition of the breeding\r\ninterests, and indeed of all interests, the horsemen of the whole country\r\nfeel that they are carrying too heavy a burden in supporting so many\r\npapers, and the question of the “survival of the fittest” is already\r\nimminent. But, whatever the present financial and intellectual condition\r\nof the breeding and sporting publications of the country may be, a number\r\nof them have had their part in the discussions and wrangles that were\r\nnaturally coincident with the progress of the revolution on the question\r\nof breeding the trotter, which finally brushed everything out of its way\r\nand fully established the truth of the laws of inheritance. Twenty-five\r\nyears ago there was a good number of intelligent and capable writers\r\non the horse, and they were either engaged in editing horse papers or\r\ncontributed to them, and one and all they were handicapped with the idea,\r\ninherited from their fathers, that whatever of excellence that was found\r\nin the American horse came from the English race horse, and that all the\r\nspeed, at any gait, that he was able to show came from the same source.\r\nFrom this absurd fallacy, it naturally followed that speed at the trot\r\nwas merely the result of accident or of the persistent skill of the\r\ntrainer. This was, substantially, the view of the general public at that\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, it was announced that the horse was far more than a\r\nmere machine, that he had a mental as well as a physical organization,\r\nthat these were both equally matters of inheritance, that one horse ran\r\nfast because his ancestors ran fast and that another horse trotted fast\r\nbecause his ancestors were able to trot fast, and that no fast runner\r\nwas ever a fast trotter, there was a tremendous hubbub. This was a new\r\ngospel, and it threatened to annihilate the stupid Anglo-Arabian fetish\r\nthat all that was good in horsedom must of necessity come from that\r\nsource. For generations the belief had been universal that the only way\r\nto improve the horse for any purpose under the sun was to “breed up” to\r\nthe running horse and thus get back to the blood of the pure Arabian.\r\nOn the other hand, and as opposed to this ancient fallacy that the way\r\nto breed the trotter was to go to the runner, it was urged, with a\r\nthousand proofs at the back of it, that the way to breed the runner was\r\nto go to the horse that could run, and the way to breed the trotter was\r\nto go to the horse that could trot. Here was a direct issue squarely\r\nmade, and it was not to be expected that such men as Charles J. Foster,\r\nPeter C. Kellogg, Joseph O. Simpson, etc., all writers of ability, would\r\nquietly surrender without a battle. They had committed themselves to\r\nthe running-blood traditions, some rich men had shaped their breeding\r\nstuds in that direction, and without deciding whether a rich man had\r\nnecessarily more sense than a poor one, they knew instinctively that\r\na rich man could be more liberal in advertising, and that he could\r\nbe more generous in properly recognizing the little courtesies that\r\nmight be extended in the way of keeping his establishment before the\r\npublic in an approving light. Thus, with an eye to the weather-gauge,\r\nthe editors were able to maintain their own consistency. As the\r\nexperiences of every succeeding year added thousands of proofs to the\r\nplain proposition that the trotter inherits his speed from a trotting\r\nancestry, the “irreconcilables” began to shift their ground, conceding\r\nthat there must be trotting blood to give the action, but that there\r\nmust be “speed-sustaining” blood from the thoroughbred to give courage\r\nand endurance. This was the second position, and in a commercial sense\r\nit was shrewdly chosen for the advantage of certain localities. This\r\nposition furnished the “thoroughbred foundation” argument, and for a time\r\nit had its supporters. This theory also furnished its promised commercial\r\nadvantages to such localities as had formerly bred running horses, and\r\nit was but a week till everybody in those localities had “thoroughbred\r\nfoundations” for their trotting pedigrees, and those who did not have\r\nthem could easily procure them. This brought an avalanche of pedigrees,\r\nespecially from Kentucky, with “thoroughbred foundations,” consisting\r\nof long strings of dams by famous horses, but without names, dates,\r\nbreeders or histories, and many of them impossible. To checkmate this\r\ninundation of manufactured foundations, in the office of the Register,\r\na rule was adopted requiring satisfactory identification and history\r\nof each dam, and where that could not be given the pedigree would be\r\ncut off. This rule saved the “Trotting Register” from becoming the mere\r\ndumping place for countless frauds, but it aroused such a feeling of\r\nantagonism on the part of the manager of Woodburn Farm that he, at once,\r\nstarted an opposition Register to be compiled at the farm, under his own\r\npersonal direction. Of this, and what came of it, I will speak further\r\non. It is but just that I should say here, that from a wide knowledge of\r\nmen and from a study of their moral fiber extending through many years\r\nin connection with horse affairs, I have found many Kentuckians that\r\nwere thoroughly truthful and reliable in pedigree matters; but at the\r\nsame time it must be admitted that the conditions there for generations\r\npast have not been favorable, among horsemen, for the cultivation of\r\nthe highest type of truthfulness. Many of them have been making their\r\nown pedigrees for so long, and padding them out with nameless dams by\r\nsuppositious sires, to suit themselves—and the market—that they don’t\r\ntake kindly to any restraint in what they consider their own business.\r\n\r\nThe great central truth in reproduction, whether of animals or plants,\r\nis summed up in the homely but axiomatic phrase, “like begets like.”\r\nWith the rank and file of intelligent breeders who were able to think,\r\nthis axiom was soon accepted as a fundamental and basic truth. The\r\nphrase “trotting instinct” was soon in everybody’s mouth, and the broad,\r\nplain distinction between that and “running instinct” was so palpable\r\nand easy of practical comprehension that the fallacy of a “thoroughbred\r\nfoundation” was buried out of sight. When it was considered that the\r\ninstinct of the one was to put forth his supreme effort at the trot,\r\nand of the other to put forth his supreme effort at the gallop, the\r\nirreconcilable antagonism between the two gaits was apparent. The\r\ncumulative evidences furnished year after year by the official records\r\nof performances on the tracks, and all going to show that the trotting\r\nhorse must have a trotting inheritance, soon became so overwhelming in\r\nthe uniformity of their teachings, and so completely unanswerable in\r\nthe force of numbers, that no man able to observe and think could any\r\nlonger doubt the truth of the position taken. But, unfortunately, some\r\nmen can neither observe nor think, and, what is still more unfortunate,\r\nthey not infrequently undertake to fill the rôle of public teachers\r\nand leaders of public thought. We can understand how a man of average\r\nintelligence may be wise in many things and foolish in others. When\r\nwe come to study the phenomena he presents, we find he has studied the\r\nsubjects on which he is wise, and he is ignorant on the subjects on which\r\nhe is foolish. Like “Brother Jasper,” the negro preacher, he is ready\r\nto maintain against all comers that “the sun do move.” Another class of\r\nmen in the writing fraternity, but fortunately they are restricted in\r\nnumbers, have brains enough to apprehend the facts surrounding them and\r\ntheir teachings, but they have not conscience enough to lift them above\r\ntheir toadying instincts, for fear they might miss the crumbs from a\r\nrich patron’s table. Another type of man, generally a beginner in the\r\nbreeding business, has a half-and-half-bred stallion at the head of his\r\nlittle stud, and he is uniformly an enthusiast for the “thoroughbred\r\nfoundation.” As might be expected, he fills the columns of all the papers\r\naccessible with his “views of breeding,” which are always shaped to fit\r\nhis own stallion and bring him patronage. We might here go on and point\r\nout other types of would-be “teachers” that would be entertaining, but\r\ncertainly not profitable or instructive. We might follow the vagaries\r\nof different writers and show the origin and reason for those vagaries,\r\nbut as the breeding world has become far more intelligent, and I think\r\nmore honest, than it was twenty-five years ago, one vagary after another\r\nhas disappeared and been buried out of sight. All such trumpery as, “to\r\nbreed the trotter you must go to the runner,” “more running blood in the\r\ntrotter,” “thoroughbred foundation,” etc., are phrases that are never\r\nheard in our day among intelligent breeders. A mile in two minutes and\r\nthirty seconds is “played out” as an evidence of trotting speed, but it\r\nis still held in its place as such evidence to suit the blood and methods\r\nof development at one particular establishment, and to gather in the\r\nmoney for registration from the little fellows.\r\n\r\nAnything slower than “two-twenty” is no longer looked upon as of any\r\nvalue in a trotting sense.\r\n\r\nThis astonishing increase of speed has come hand in hand with a closer\r\nand more careful observance of the law of inheritance, or heredity. If\r\nwe breed the merino ram upon a merino ewe, we know that the produce\r\nwill be a merino. If we breed the cotswold on the cotswold we know the\r\nproduce will be a cotswold, but if we breed the merino on the cotswold\r\nthe produce will be a mongrel. The physical inheritance is destroyed,\r\nand in propagating from this mongrel confusion, uncertainty and\r\ndisappointment always follow. If we go a step higher and consider those\r\ntypes of domestic animals endowed with a species of mentality that we\r\ncall instinct, we find the illustrations still more marked and effective.\r\nThe finely bred greyhound coupled with the finely bred pointer produces\r\nneither a greyhound nor a pointer, but only a nondescript cur. Sometimes\r\nthe instincts of the greyhound and sometimes the instincts of the pointer\r\nmay be the more masterful, but the inheritance is broken and divided, and\r\nthe mongrel should never be used for propagation. If we couple the very\r\nbest specimen of the English race horse with the very best and fastest\r\nAmerican trotting mare, the produce would be literally half-and-half\r\nbred. The sire never could trot a mile in four minutes and the dam never\r\ncould run a mile in two minutes, and what is the produce good for? Once\r\nin a hundred times the running instinct might predominate and develop\r\nsomething of a runner, and once in a hundred times the trotting instinct\r\nmight predominate, as in the case of Bonnie Scotland and Waterwitch, and\r\nproduce something of a trotter, but of what value would the half-and-half\r\nprogeny be for breeding purposes? Whatever might be the characteristics\r\nof their progeny, physically, they would undoubtedly and invariably\r\ninherit and transmit not only divided, but antagonistic, instincts that\r\nwould require generations of careful selection and training to get rid\r\nof. While the “featherheads” may, for the sake of personal consistency,\r\nwhich is a very weighty matter of public concern, still advocate “more\r\nrunning blood in the trotter;” and while one great concern may still look\r\none way, on this question, and row the other, it being literally true\r\nthat she has not added a single drop of running blood to her trotting\r\nstud in a quarter of a century, it is safe to say that the whole body of\r\nintelligent breeders of this country have come to accept and obey the\r\ngreat central truth that the American trotter has reached his present\r\nstate of perfection by the development of his unbroken and undivided\r\ntrotting inheritances. These inheritances have been cumulative and thus\r\nmade stronger in each developed generation of ancestors, and if this high\r\ndevelopment of speed is kept up for a series of successive generations\r\nthe speed of the American trotter will be placed at a point of which we\r\nhave never yet dreamed. The inherited and developed instinct to stick to\r\nthe trot as the fastest gait of which the horse is conscious, coupled\r\nwith skillful preparation and handling, are the two factors that will\r\nalways put the American trotting horse in the front rank and keep him\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIn the early chapters of this work we have considered the horse in his\r\noriginal habitat and his distribution among the different peoples of\r\nthe then known world, but we have not considered the distribution of\r\nthe trotter through the different regions of our own country. Fifty or\r\nsixty years ago the trotting horse was hardly known outside of a limited\r\nterritory embracing the cities of New York and Philadelphia. In the New\r\nEngland States the trappy little Morgan filled the place of the driving\r\nhorse with very great acceptance, but he had no speed as a trotter. We\r\nthen began to see and hear something of the “Maine Messengers,” that\r\nwere trotters in reality and able to demonstrate their speed and courage\r\non the track. Occasionally a converted pacer would strike a trot and\r\nshow speed that was phenomenal in that day, but it was uniformly treated\r\nas “accidental.” There was a great deal of high-class trotting blood\r\nin the region of Philadelphia, and for a time that was the leading\r\ncenter of the trotting interest, but it did not receive that measure of\r\nencouragement and support that was necessary to its permanent growth,\r\nand the seat of empire was transferred to Long Island and Orange County,\r\nNew York. South of Mason and Dixon’s line the trotter was tabooed, as a\r\nmongrel nondescript, and “not worthy of the attention of a gentleman,\r\nsah.” They had runners and they had pacers, and as all excellence in the\r\nshape of a horse, at whatever gait, as they argued, must come from the\r\nrunning horse or his progenitor, the Arabian, they had already the very\r\nbest material in the world for the production of the fast trotter. The\r\nbelief as expressed in their motto, “Speed at the gallop was a guarantee\r\nof speed at any other gait required,” pervaded all minds and directed\r\nall action in matters of breeding. Thus they worked away for years\r\ntrying to breed trotters from blood that never could and that never did\r\ntrot, and, strange as it may seem, there are still some people in that\r\nregion, at the close of the nineteenth century, trying to breed trotters\r\nfrom runners. From New York as a common center all the breeding States\r\nobtained their supplies of trotting blood, and they in time became\r\nsources of supply. The only exception to this is that of the pacer, which\r\neventually developed into a trotting element of some prominence and\r\nvalue, especially in the West and South.\r\n\r\nThe prominence of Kentucky as a breeding center is wholly due to the\r\ntrotting blood she obtained from New York. She had plenty of pacing\r\nblood that was good, of its kind, but it was so uncertain and sporadic\r\nthat it did not commend itself to the breeders of that section as a\r\nsource of trotting speed. From an early period in the history of the\r\nState the habits and fancies of the people, in the richer portions, had\r\nbeen “horsey,” from their knowledge and familiarity with running races\r\nfor many years, and thus when the demand came for trotters they struck\r\nout vigorously to meet that demand. When Mr. R. A. Alexander organized\r\nthe great Woodburn Farm he established a department of trotters, which\r\nwas among the very first of any magnitude in the State. As he had been\r\nreared abroad he knew nothing about American pedigrees, and in making\r\nhis purchases of breeding stock he was victimized by every sharper who\r\ncame along with a brood mare to sell. He was a man of honest purpose and\r\nexcellent natural judgment which told him to buy such breeding animals\r\nas could trot themselves or had produced trotters, and if he had been\r\ncontent to stop with what little he knew of their breeding he would\r\nhave been all right; but, meantime, the professional pedigree-maker—the\r\nsuccessor to the famous Patrick Nesbitt Edgar—came along and tricked them\r\nout in an excellent quality of pinchbeck pedigrees containing plenty of\r\nrunning blood that had never trotted nor produced a trotter. When the\r\nfirst Mr. Alexander died he was succeeded in the proprietorship of the\r\ngreat estate by his brother, a very worthy gentleman who made it a law to\r\nthe establishment that none of his horses should ever start in a race.\r\nHis fancy and knowledge were all in the line of cattle, and he seemed\r\nto neither know nor care anything about horses. Soon after this change\r\nin the ownership of the estate a new manager was placed in charge, and\r\nit was soon manifest that however absurd and untruthful the pedigrees\r\nof breeding stock might be, they must not be questioned nor corrected\r\nby any authority whatever. This doctrine of infallibility as applied to\r\nWoodburn pedigrees was wholly incompatible with what I conceived to be\r\nmy duty to the breeding public. I had accepted the Woodburn pedigrees,\r\nat the start, as trustworthy, on the grounds of the eminence and high\r\ncharacter of the first Mr. Alexander, and it was far more than a surprise\r\nto me when I discovered something of the extent to which the pedigrees\r\nof the whole establishment had been honeycombed with the dishonesty\r\nof “sharpers” and “pedigree-makers.” These fictions antedated any\r\ncompilation or known authority of trotting pedigrees, and there can be\r\nno doubt they were accepted as honest statements of the blood of the\r\nanimals in question, while many of them were wholly fictitious and all of\r\nthem contained crosses on the maternal side that were merely imaginary.\r\nThese embellishments, to call them by no harder name, were uniformly in\r\none and the same direction, all stretching out to embrace as much of the\r\nblood of the running horse as possible, and often a great deal that was\r\nimpossible. Here I may state the general fact that all Kentuckians had\r\nclaimed and exercised the right so long to shape up their pedigrees to\r\nsuit themselves and to bring the most money in the market that a number\r\nof them still claimed that as a right and became somewhat restive when\r\ntold that their pedigrees would be recorded just as far as they were\r\nproved, and no further. Two or three breeders expostulated against this\r\nrule, and in reply they were assured that they had a perfect right to\r\nshape their pedigrees as they pleased, but that insertion in the Register\r\nwas the same as my personal indorsement, and that this indorsement could\r\nnot be given to any pedigree that I did not know or believe to be honest\r\nand true. This ended all doubts about the position and character of the\r\nRegister, and I think that every breeder of any standing in Kentucky\r\nsubmitted to the rule, with the solitary exception of Woodburn Farm.\r\nThe manager of that establishment was not only unwilling to have the\r\ninfallibility of Woodburn pedigrees called in question, but he aspired to\r\nthe control of the pedigrees of all other breeders in the whole country.\r\nWhen the National Association of Trotting Horse Breeders was organized in\r\nDecember, 1876, he was not only asked, but pressed, to become a member\r\nand take part in its management and control. But no, he would be “boss,”\r\nor he would be nothing. New York was not the right place to organize it.\r\nIt should be organized in Kentucky, and with the manager of Woodburn\r\nat the head of it. The arrogance of this young manager was something\r\namazing, his intrigues to get control of registration were continued for\r\na number of years, and the means employed to accomplish his ends were of\r\nsuch a character as clearly to demonstrate that of all the men in the\r\nworld he was the last one who should be placed in the control of such a\r\ntrust. As this controversy extended through the period of building up the\r\nbreed of trotters, it is of necessity a part of the literature of the\r\nformation of that breed, and as some of the more salient points seem to\r\nbe of sufficient importance to hand down to future generations, I will\r\nhere consider them very briefly. In doing this I am conscious of some\r\nfeeling of embarrassment on account of the personal matters that must\r\nenter into the recital, but it is a part of the trotting history of the\r\ntimes, and I prefer that the truth may be preserved, whatever may be the\r\nteachings of the canons of taste.\r\n\r\nIn the collection and registration of pedigrees that seemed to be more\r\nor less closely allied to trotting blood, embracing all contained in the\r\nfirst, second and third volumes of the “Trotting Register,” there was no\r\nguide or rule to determine what was worthy of registration, in a trotting\r\nsense, and what was unworthy. I had a general conception of the families\r\nthat had produced trotters and those that had not, but I had no rule by\r\nwhich I could decide what to admit and what to reject, except that all\r\nactual performers of reputable speed must be admitted. To undertake,\r\non individual responsibility, to determine what amount of trotting\r\nblood should be requisite to admission, and how that amount should\r\nbe measured, was quite too hazardous, except when backed by a strong\r\nmoral and numerical force of breeders. Hence my active interest in the\r\norganization of the National Association of Trotting Horse Breeders, and\r\nmy earnest desire that it might be composed of breeders of high standing\r\nand character from all parts of the country. Upon the organization of\r\nthe association, its character was so entirely acceptable to me that I\r\ndid not hesitate to place in its hands the supervisory control of the\r\nregistration of pedigrees for the “Trotting Register,” to be exercised\r\nby a Board of Censors to be appointed annually. The first board was\r\nappointed and entered on its functions January 15, 1877, by formulating\r\nthe first set of rules relating to the requisites necessary to the\r\nacceptance of pedigrees, in their form and completeness. The third volume\r\nwas then approaching completion and the Board of Censors commenced their\r\nsupervisory duties on that volume.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Breeders’ Association were generally men of\r\nintelligence, and capable of thinking, and every suitable opportunity was\r\nimproved to get their individual views on the question as to whether a\r\nset of rules could be adopted by the association that would distinguish\r\nbetween animals that had trotted themselves or produced trotters in say\r\n2:30, and animals that had not. Not many had ever thought of the subject,\r\nbut all were ready to think of it more. The only objection urged was\r\nthat such a scheme would certainly reduce the fees for registration in\r\nlarge degree. To this I assented as doubtless true for the time being,\r\nthough in the end it would largely increase them, but declared that it\r\nwas not for the fees I was working, but to establish a breed of trotting\r\nhorses. When satisfied that a good number of the leading breeders were\r\nthinking favorably of the subject, it was presented to the public in\r\na very modest and unpretentious way. In discussing “The Future of the\r\nBreeders’ Association,” in _Wallace’s Monthly_ for April, 1878, the\r\nfollowing language occurs:\r\n\r\n    “In addition to the thought and labor necessary to secure such\r\n    an organization as the interest demands, there is another topic\r\n    that will require great deliberation and wisdom, in the near\r\n    future. The association must fix a standard of admission to the\r\n    official record of pedigrees. Up to the present time there has\r\n    been no standard of blood requisite to secure a place in the\r\n    Register. This matter has been left wholly to the compiler,\r\n    without even so much as advice on the subject. The Register,\r\n    therefore, has no value as a classification of blood, but\r\n    only as a reliable record of the pedigrees of the animals it\r\n    contains, whatever their blood may be.”\r\n\r\nThis is the first intimation ever given to the public, so far as I\r\nknow, that any body of men ever contemplated the construction of a\r\nstandard to control the admission of trotting horses to specific rank\r\nand registration. The question was thus placed openly before the public\r\nand it was looked upon favorably by those most immediately interested.\r\nIn due time, at a meeting of the Breeders’ Association, a committee was\r\nappointed to whom was referred all the suggestions that had been made for\r\nthe proposed scheme. Soon afterward (November 19, 1879) the committee\r\nreported the standard to a large, enthusiastic and harmonious meeting of\r\nthe Association, and it was unanimously adopted as follows:\r\n\r\n    THE STANDARD OF ADMISSION TO REGISTRATION.\r\n\r\n    (Established by the National Association of Trotting-Horse\r\n    Breeders, November 19, 1879.)\r\n\r\n    In order to define what constitutes a trotting-bred horse, and\r\n    to establish a BREED of trotters on a more intelligent basis,\r\n    the following rules are adopted to control admission to the\r\n    records of pedigrees. When an animal meets the requirements of\r\n    admission and is duly registered, it shall be accepted as a\r\n    standard trotting-bred animal.\r\n\r\n    FIRST.—Any stallion that has, himself, a record of two minutes\r\n    and thirty seconds (2:30) or better; provided any of his get\r\n    has a record of 2:40 or better; or provided his sire or his\r\n    dam, his grandsire or his grandam, is already a standard animal.\r\n\r\n    SECOND.—Any mare or gelding that has a record of 2:30 or better.\r\n\r\n    THIRD.—Any horse that is the sire of two animals with a record\r\n    of 2:30 or better.\r\n\r\n    FOURTH.—Any horse that is the sire of one animal with a record\r\n    of 2:30 or better; provided he has either of the following\r\n    additional qualifications:\r\n\r\n    1.—A record himself of 2:40 or better.\r\n\r\n    2.—Is the sire of two other animals with a record of 2:40 or\r\n    better.\r\n\r\n    3.—Has a sire or dam, grandsire or grandam that is already a\r\n    standard animal.\r\n\r\n    FIFTH.—Any mare that has produced an animal with a record of\r\n    2:30 or better.\r\n\r\n    SIXTH.—The progeny of a standard horse when out of a standard\r\n    mare.\r\n\r\n    SEVENTH.—The progeny of a standard horse out of a mare by a\r\n    standard horse.\r\n\r\n    EIGHTH.—The progeny of a standard horse when out of a mare\r\n    whose dam is a standard mare.\r\n\r\n    NINTH.—Any mare that has a record of 2:40 or better, and whose\r\n    sire or dam, grandsire or grandam is a standard animal.\r\n\r\n    TENTH.—A record to wagon of 2:35 or better shall be regarded as\r\n    equal to a 2:30 record.\r\n\r\nIn this, its original form, the standard was administered successfully\r\nand smoothly through the period of the compilation of volumes four, five,\r\nsix, and seven of the “Trotting Register,” when it was revised by the\r\nBreeders’ Association as follows:\r\n\r\n    THE STANDARD.\r\n\r\n    (AS REVISED AND ADOPTED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF\r\n    TROTTING-HORSE BREEDERS, DECEMBER 14, 1887.)\r\n\r\n    In order to define what constitutes a trotting bred horse and\r\n    to establish a BREED of trotters on a more intelligent basis,\r\n    the following rules are adopted to control admission to the\r\n    records of pedigrees. When an animal meets the requirements\r\n    of admission and is duly registered it shall be accepted as a\r\n    standard trotting-bred animal.\r\n\r\n    FIRST.—Any stallion that has himself a record of two minutes\r\n    and thirty seconds (2:30) or better, provided any of his get\r\n    has a record of 2:35 or better, or provided his sire or his dam\r\n    is already a standard animal.\r\n\r\n    SECOND.—Any mare or gelding that has a record of 2:30 or better.\r\n\r\n    THIRD.—Any horse that is the sire of two animals with a record\r\n    of 2:30 or better.\r\n\r\n    FOURTH.—Any horse that is the sire of one animal with a record\r\n    of 2:30 or better, provided he has either of the following\r\n    additional qualifications: (1) A record himself of 2:35 or\r\n    better. (2) Is the sire of two other animals with a record\r\n    of 2:35 or better. (3) Has a sire or dam that is already a\r\n    standard animal.\r\n\r\n    FIFTH.—Any mare that has produced an animal with a record of\r\n    2:30 or better.\r\n\r\n    SIXTH.—The progeny of a standard horse when out of a standard\r\n    mare.\r\n\r\n    SEVENTH.—The female progeny of a standard horse when out of a\r\n    mare by a standard horse.\r\n\r\n    EIGHTH.—The female progeny of a standard horse when out of a\r\n    mare whose dam is a standard mare.\r\n\r\n    NINTH.—Any mare that has a record of 2:35 or better, and whose\r\n    sire or dam is a standard animal.\r\n\r\nFrom the indefinite and unsatisfactory starting point, and without\r\nany rule or guide as to what should be admitted, except the pointless\r\nphrase, “well related to trotting blood,” it soon became evident that\r\nthe Register would soon contain as much chaff as wheat. Through the\r\n_Monthly_, which was established for that purpose, I did not despair of\r\nthe success of my aim in leading the intelligent breeders of the country\r\nup to the point of recognizing and establishing the American trotting\r\nhorse as a BREED. The road was long, steep, rough in places, and beset\r\nwith prejudices on all sides, but labor conquers all things, and we\r\nhave in the standard and its revision, as given above, the culmination\r\nand perfection of the implements that were to effect this purpose. To\r\nreject a horse from registration merely because he was running bred would\r\nhave been “flying in the face” of the prejudices of nearly everybody,\r\nbut to reject him because neither he nor any of his tribe had ever been\r\nable to trot, was philosophical and just; and as it gave no section\r\nof the country an advantage over any other section, and no theory an\r\nadvantage over a fact, no man could gainsay or criticise its justice or\r\nits truthfulness. This was the wedge that split the rock of ignorance\r\nand prejudice, and thus exploded the theories of generations as to the\r\nvalue of running blood in the trotter. As I look at it to-day, the\r\nundertaking to gather up a great lot of fragments and convert them into\r\na breed was a tremendous one, and although it was backed up with brains\r\nand influence, it is doubtful whether many of its promoters had any very\r\nclear conception of the results that would follow—either its success\r\nor its failure. It assumed to direct and control the trotting-horse\r\nbreeding interest of the whole country, and to leave its impress for\r\nall time. It required no gift of prophecy to see this as the result of\r\nsuccess, and neither did it require any gift of prophecy to foresee\r\nthat failure would wipe out the work already done in both the Register\r\nand the _Monthly_. It was the crucial period in the history of these\r\npublications. A misstep or an unwise provision would have brought a\r\ndisastrous end. To found a breed of horses resting primarily and wholly\r\nupon performance and the blood descended directly from performers, or the\r\nproducers of performers, was something that never had been attempted in\r\nthe world. The basis was wholly unique, but it commended itself to the\r\npublic judgment as a just one, and as the only foundation upon which the\r\nproposed breed could be successfully established. The basis was wisely\r\nchosen and the superstructure erected thereon was equally wise in all its\r\nprovisions. Never have we known a set of men to work more earnestly or\r\nmore unselfishly for the common purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter very careful consideration in a large and intelligent committee,\r\nthe finished labors of that committee was reported to the Association on\r\nNovember 19, 1879, at the Everett House, in this city, and the standard\r\nwas then and there adopted without so much as a question and without a\r\nvoice or a vote being raised against it. Thus the standard was launched\r\nin unity and wisdom, and from that day it went forward on its mission\r\nof educating the people. The “Trotting Register” has done much and the\r\n_Monthly_ has done something in the way of education, but the standard\r\nhas been the special formula through which all these teachings have been\r\nbrought home to the breeder, great and small, in a manner that educated\r\nboth his mind and his pocket. If we could conceive of the brightest mind\r\ndirecting the most pointed pen for the period of a hundred years in the\r\nspecial department of how to breed the trotting horse, we feel sure he\r\nwould fail to accomplish as much as this little, practical formula called\r\nthe “Standard” accomplished in the first dozen years of its existence.\r\n\r\nWhen the standard was adopted and put in operation there was a material\r\nadvance in the market value of all animals registered under its\r\nrequirements, and it thus became not only a matter of honor, but of\r\nprofit, to breed only in the standard ranks. Everybody was willing to\r\npay more for a good horse that was standard in his breeding than for\r\none equally good that was not standard in his breeding. A record of\r\n2:30 was then accepted as evidence of a high rate of speed, everywhere.\r\nThere was a grand rush for standard rank and the number of fraudulent\r\nperformances sent forward in order to secure such classification was\r\noverwhelming. This led to many rejections of performances, adroitly\r\nshaped up to deceive, and every rejection made a batch of enemies. But\r\ngreat as this evil was, there was another that began to manifest itself\r\nvery strongly. The Register was rapidly filling up with colts under rules\r\nseven and eight, and everyone of them, as soon as he was able to stand\r\nup, wanted his number, for he was to be kept as a standard stallion. The\r\npublic attention was urgently called to the preponderating numbers of\r\nthese feebly bred colts, as a menace to the hitherto unimpeded progress\r\nof the grand purpose of establishing a breed. The Breeders’ Association\r\nthereupon took up the standard and revised it, wholly in the direction\r\nof higher qualifications and more stringent requirements. By comparing\r\nthe revised standard with the original, above, it will be observed that\r\nrule ten was stricken out, and that rules seven and eight were restricted\r\nto fillies only, thus cutting off the source of danger altogether. The\r\nrates of subsidiary speed were advanced and there was a tightening up\r\nof the requirements in other directions. This revision did not suit all\r\ninterests, especially beginners who were just starting to breed their\r\nfirst colt by a standard horse, but as every one knew there would never\r\nbe a time when there would not be just such groundless complaints, the\r\naction received the hearty indorsement and support of all breeders who\r\nkept in view the central object of the standard in building up a breed of\r\ntrotters.\r\n\r\nWhen fast horses began to multiply by the thousand, annually, say about\r\n1890-91, we began to hear an increasing number of gibes at the standard\r\nas “a slow coach,” “away behind the times,” “a 2:30 horse was no longer\r\nconsidered a trotter,” etc., and every one of these taunts had an element\r\nof truth in it. The standard, as the teacher of the breeders of the\r\ncountry, had not only produced trotters, but _great_ trotters, with\r\nmarvelous rapidity. At one time it was the ambition of all breeders to\r\nplace their stock inside of the limits of the standard, not only because\r\nit was an honor, but because it added materially to the bank account and\r\nto the value of every animal, so bred, in the establishment. But breeders\r\nboth great and small are no longer stimulated to enter a standard with\r\nthe antiquated 2:30 rate of speed that is everywhere received with a\r\nsneer. When the standard was formed on the basis of 2:30, it was within\r\nabout fifteen seconds of the fastest performance, and if the same ratio\r\nwere now preserved, “2:30” would be stricken out and “2:20” inserted\r\ninstead. The breeders would again be stimulated to look forward with\r\nhope, and not backward with regret.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous criticisms of the standard after its adoption, there\r\nwere none of any special force or practicability, but from one source\r\nthere was a persistent war made upon it, not because it was unfair in\r\nits principles or administration, nor because it lacked vigor in its\r\nsupport, but evidently because it was not controlled in Kentucky, and\r\nthat the pivotal authority of that control was not placed in the hands of\r\nthe manager at Woodburn. It is but just that I should say here that many\r\nof the stanchest and most enthusiastic supporters of the standard and\r\nthe Register were Kentuckians, and with the exceptions of two or three\r\nbreeders who stood well in their community, and a few others who were\r\nbankrupt in character and morals, there were no enemies to engage in this\r\nwar. I would gladly skip over this period, for it is of necessity more\r\nor less personal, but to omit it would leave the history of the times\r\nand of the formation of the breed of trotters incomplete, and liable to\r\nmisrepresentation by those who may come after us.\r\n\r\nThe first public suggestion or demand for a standard, and the first use\r\nof the word “standard” in connection with rules for registration, was\r\naddressed to the Breeders’ Association, in the paragraph quoted above,\r\nfrom the _Monthly_ for April, 1878. In that paragraph, while no specific\r\nrules were formulated, the whole scope of such rules was foreshadowed.\r\n\r\nIn the course of correspondence with breeders all over the country as to\r\ntheir views about the provisions of the proposed standard, I received\r\nfrom Mr. Henry C. McDowell, of Kentucky, a little slip of paper, perhaps\r\nas large as your hand, marked “copyrighted,” on which were printed a\r\nnumber of rules that purported to be rules for the admission of certain\r\nanimals, trotters and runners, to some book that was not named or\r\ndescribed. This little paper was courteously received and commended as a\r\nstep in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThe idea of inserting the word “copyrighted” seemed to be that it\r\nmight serve as a “scare head” and thus deter all makers of books from\r\nattempting to make a book under the provisions of these rules. These\r\nrules were strictly tentative, and they were peddled about for months,\r\nand changed several times to see whether they would be acceptable or\r\nnot, and every revised and corrected edition was marked “copyrighted.”\r\n\r\nSome of the rules that were, we might say, self-evident, were not very\r\nobjectionable, but others again were simply intended to give Woodburn\r\nand those who had their breeding stock from that establishment a great\r\nadvantage over all other breeders. The selfish object of the fourth rule\r\nis palpable, as follows: “Any mare, the dam of any mare or stallion that\r\nhas produced or sired a horse, mare or gelding, with a record of two\r\nminutes and thirty seconds or better.”\r\n\r\nTo the original draft of six rules, “rule seven” was afterward added,\r\nwhich reads: “The full sister of any animal entered under rules one,\r\ntwo, three, and four.” This was the capsheaf of absurdity, for it not\r\nonly made the grandams of trotters standard trotting brood mares, but\r\nall their sisters also. This not only embraced a large number of running\r\nmares, genuine and bogus alike, in Kentucky, but it reached across the\r\nAtlantic and made one of the greatest of English dams of running horses,\r\nand all her famous sisters, standard trotting brood mares in America.\r\nBonnie Scotland, the great racing sire, never was able to get a trotter\r\nexcept from old Waterwitch, and upon the strength of that scratch, his\r\nsisters and his mother and his aunts were all made standard trotters.\r\nNo wonder this marvelously stupid production came to be known as the\r\n“Pinafore Standard.” [A more extended review of the “Pinafore Standard”\r\nmay be found in _Wallace’s Monthly_ for December, 1879, page 831.]\r\n\r\nBut when we come to consider the ultimate result intended to be reached,\r\nthe scheme was not “marvelously stupid”—it was not the work of a fool,\r\nbut of the other kind of fellow. The admission of the grandmothers and\r\nall their sisters was not specially intended to bring in the great\r\nEnglish racing mare and all her sisters as standard-bred American\r\ntrotters, but it was intended to bring in a great host of Kentucky\r\nrunning-bred mares that never could trot a mile in four minutes, and\r\nplace them on an exact equality of rank with mares that had records of\r\n2:20 or less. This would not only place Kentucky away ahead of the North\r\nin the length of her lines of inheritance, but would place Woodburn away\r\nabove all competitors, either North or South, and with a little help of\r\nthe Edgar-Bruce type, we would soon have had “twelfth dam, fifteenth\r\ndam,” etc., not one of them named and not one of them honest. Great\r\nlocal, and especially personal, advantages were to accrue, and the\r\ntheory that Kentucky running blood was not the best trotting blood in the\r\nworld was to be smashed, and here we reach “the milk in the cocoanut.”\r\nSo far as we can understand the conditions as they then existed and\r\nso far as we can analyze the facts developed, this seems to be a fair\r\ninterpretation of the impelling motive. In an unfortunate hour I took\r\nup this buntling of the young manager and exposed its absurdities,\r\naddressing the exposure to a highly esteemed personal friend whose name\r\nwas connected with the movement, and just as soon as the gentlemen\r\ninterested could be got together, every vestige of the “Pinafore”\r\nfeatures was eliminated, the poor old grandmothers and their sisters\r\nbeing ruthlessly turned out in the cold. This was the first set-back\r\nwhich Mr. Brodhead received in his enterprise, which was to accomplish so\r\nmuch for Woodburn, and which ended so disastrously.\r\n\r\nThere was another feature embraced in the “Pinafore,” and protected by\r\nthe same “copyright,” that was of special significance. It was provided\r\nthat time made in a public trial, against the watch, should be accepted\r\nas of equal value with time made in a race with other horses. It is\r\nnot worth while to stop to consider the question as to whether these\r\ntwo kinds of performance are of equal merit, and should receive equal\r\nhonor, for every honest man will call such a claim a bald absurdity on\r\nits face. Then why has Woodburn, from time immemorial, it will be asked,\r\nalways refused to enter a colt in a stake or start one against others? If\r\nyou ask the manager he will tell you that Mr. Alexander, the owner, is\r\nopposed to racing in all its forms. Then why does Woodburn, in one form\r\nor other, hold so much stock in the Kentucky Breeders’ Association, one\r\nof the most notorious gambling concerns in the whole country? We will\r\nnot press this question too closely. There can be no shadow of doubt,\r\ntherefore, that this feature of the “Pinafore” was the special product of\r\nthe mind of the manager at Woodburn, for no one of the other gentlemen\r\nwould be willing to own it.\r\n\r\nThe quasi-organization from which, nominally, the “Pinafore Standard”\r\nemanated consisted of the five gentlemen following: Lucas Brodhead,\r\nHenry C. McDowell, Richard S. Veech, James C. McFerran, and Colonel\r\nRichard West. The names of these five gentlemen when appended to any\r\nmatter connected with their enterprise and given to the public had no\r\nrank assigned to them, except “Committee on Rules.” This implied that\r\nthere was an organization behind them that had appointed them to this\r\nduty, but there never was even a shadow of such an organization. Mr.\r\nBrodhead was manager at Woodburn and ambitious to control the trotting\r\npedigrees of the whole country, and for the methods employed the reader\r\nis referred to page 430 of this volume. Mr. McDowell is simply Mr.\r\nBrodhead’s echo. In December, 1877, he attended the annual meeting of the\r\nNational Association of Trotting Horse Breeders, and out of compliment\r\nto Kentucky he was elected president. He was about the city two or three\r\ndays, and before he left for home he resigned without ever intimating any\r\nreason why he resigned. Mr. Veech is a man of undoubted integrity and\r\nplenty of brains, and was identified with the Breeders’ Association from\r\nthe start. Mr. McFerran and Colonel West are both dead, and while it was\r\nnot my privilege to know them intimately, I knew enough of them to trust\r\nthem as honorable and honest men. Not long after the appearance of the\r\noriginal suggestion in the _Monthly_, as given above, that a standard of\r\nqualifications for admission to registration was of paramount importance,\r\nand that the preparation of such a standard was in the special province\r\nof the National Association of Trotting Horse Breeders, Manager Brodhead\r\ncaught the idea and the situation, and with Mr. McDowell hurried away to\r\nspend a night with Mr. Veech, near Louisville, and thus forestall the\r\naction the Breeders’ Association might take in the premises. They were\r\nall of one mind as to the importance of keeping Kentucky in the foremost\r\nposition as a breeding State, but they were not all of one mind as to the\r\nmeans best adapted to that end. Mr. Veech was very clear and pronounced\r\nin his views that the way to breed the trotter was to go to the trotter\r\nand not to the runner, but what Brodhead said McDowell said, and that\r\nleft him in the minority. Seated around a table, each with a copy of\r\n_Wallace’s Monthly_ containing the table of 2:30 trotters under their\r\nsires, they commenced forming some rules. With “The Great Table” before\r\nthem they could not fail to strike the self-evident requirements of a\r\nstandard, and two or three of their rules were very good, but as a matter\r\nof course the scheme of the majority to get in all the running-bred mares\r\npossible and enter them as standard trotting mares had to prevail. Hence\r\nthe provision for admitting the grandams. Imported Bonnie Scotland was\r\nkept many years in the trotting latitudes, and just got one trotter and\r\nno more at any rate of speed, hence he was a standard horse according\r\nto this scheme, and his dam, Queen Mary, in England, was a standard\r\ntrotting brood mare. Now if the dam thus became a standard trotting mare,\r\nwhy should not Iago, his sire, become a standard trotting sire? This\r\nwould have been too glaring and open, and would have been ridiculed as\r\nan absurdity by everybody. The trick had to be carried through quietly\r\nor it could not succeed. At a later period the sisters of all the\r\nstandard mares were made standard, and then came the very appropriate\r\nand expressive title of the “Pinafore Standard,” for it literally\r\nembraced “his sisters and his mother and his aunts.” This scheme would\r\nhave admitted a vast herd of so-called trotting mares in Kentucky that\r\nhad no trotting inheritance, had never trotted themselves, and never\r\nproduced a trotter. This part of the scheme was certainly not the work of\r\nthe “Committee on Rules,” but the work of an individual for the purpose\r\nof carrying out a selfish and inadmissible scheme to promote local and\r\npersonal interests. When the exposure of this scheme came out Woodburn,\r\nwith all its influence in Kentucky, could not stand against it an hour,\r\nand every “Pinafore” feature was promptly eliminated.\r\n\r\nWhen the processes of emendation and change in the “Pinafore,” and each\r\nchange “copyrighted,” were going forward, the views of the different\r\nmembers of the “Committee on Rules” did not always harmonize, and when\r\nit came to the selection of a man to do the work, part of the committee\r\ninsisted the work should be placed in the hands of John H. Wallace, and\r\nafter some discussion a committee consisting of Mr. Brodhead and Mr.\r\nMcDowell was deputed to tender this work to Mr. Wallace on such terms as\r\nwould be equitable and just. In due time a communication was received\r\nfrom these gentlemen, informing me of the business upon which they had\r\nbeen appointed and wishing to know for what compensation I would engage\r\nto compile the book, laying down the conditions upon which it must be\r\ndone. Without having a copy of this correspondence before me I can only\r\ngive the substance from memory. First, the copyright was to be in the\r\ncommittee or some member of it; second, the compilations were to be\r\nas the committee directed; and third, the book was to be the property\r\nof the committee when completed. This was a stunner, but I concluded\r\nto play out the rôle they had assigned me and see what they would do.\r\nIn my reply I put the case substantially as follows: “Your proposed\r\nbook, if ever made, must be made almost, if not quite wholly, from the\r\nfirst three volumes of the “Trotting Register,” and these volumes are\r\ncarefully protected by copyright. I have spent several years of hard\r\nlabor in compiling them, and a large amount of money in traveling over\r\nthe country tracing and verifying the facts which they contain. You ask\r\nme, in effect, to take my three volumes and to skim all the cream out of\r\nthem to make one volume for you. Now, before going an inch further, we\r\nmust understand what you are willing to pay for my property, before I can\r\nentertain any proposition to dump it into the lap of your committee.”\r\nSometimes I have been disposed to lament my hard fate in coming so near\r\nthe exalted position of “hired-man” to two such distinguished characters\r\nas Henry C. McDowell and Lucas Brodhead, but I missed it. To this letter\r\nI never received any reply, nor did these gentlemen ever make any report\r\nof their negotiations with me to the “Committee on Rules.”\r\n\r\nThe next news we had from the “Pinafore” was the announcement that the\r\nbook would be compiled at Woodburn, by LeGrand Lucas, and on inquiry\r\nas to his capacity and knowledge of the subject it was learned that he\r\nwas a young kinsman of Brodhead’s, perhaps still in his “teens,” who\r\nwas employed there as a kind of clerk or bookkeeper. He was evidently\r\nan innocent lad, for he had been installed in his new office only a\r\nvery few days when he wrote me for certain numbers of the _Monthly_, in\r\nduplicate. In reply I wrote him that each volume of the “Register” and\r\neach number of the _Monthly_ was legally covered by copyright and that\r\nI could not consent to his taking my property to make up his new book,\r\nand that he must do as I had done—commence at the beginning and hunt for\r\nhimself. Poor boy, what could he do? If he were debarred from the use of\r\nthe Wallace publications, where on the face of the globe could he get the\r\ninformation? If cribbing had to be done in order to carry out the scheme,\r\nit would be very indiscreet to do it under the very roof of Woodburn\r\nand under the supervision of its manager. Thus the work languished for\r\nmonths, and little or no progress was made.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago there was one James H. Sanders, publishing a paper, whom I had\r\nknown for years. He never had an idea of his own in the world, but he\r\nwas one of the most notorious and shameless plagiarists that I have ever\r\nknown. As an illustration of what I knew about him in this department of\r\nindustry and thought, I will give a single example that will honestly\r\nrepresent many others in my own experience. At one time he was employed\r\nseveral months as editor of _Wilkes’ Spirit of the Times_, and during\r\nthat time I wrote an article for that paper that had some pith and point\r\nin it, but I was afraid to send it for fear Sanders would steal it, so I\r\ncalled in a capable friend and told him the situation, had him read it\r\ncarefully and make some notes of the order of thought that he might know\r\nit if he ever saw it again. The paper was then signed and sent forward.\r\nIn two or three days I received an acknowledgment of the communication\r\neffusively thankful for the favor, remarking that by a singular\r\ncoincidence our minds had been running in the same channel and that when\r\nmy communication was received he already had an article in type taking\r\nthe same view of the subject. When the paper came my friend looked it\r\nover and remarked “that man is nothing more than a shameless plagiarist.”\r\n\r\nIn a short time work on the book, if it were ever begun, came practically\r\nto an end for want of material, and this was probably brought about by\r\na hint from the proprietor, Mr. Alexander, that Woodburn, with all its\r\nstrength, could not afford to sacrifice its good name for honesty, by\r\ntaking the property of another man, without his consent. At this juncture\r\nJ. H. Sanders, of Chicago, wanted a job, for ready money, and knowing\r\nthe situation in Kentucky, published an editorial going to prove that\r\npedigrees could not be copyrighted, for they belonged to the owners of\r\nthe horses, or some other such brainless argument as this. Brodhead and\r\nhis echo saw in this the opportunity of their lives, for Sanders wanted\r\nthe job, and if my work were to be appropriated they could blame it\r\nall on him. So they hied away to Chicago, and the three worthies, all\r\nfully inspired with the _animus furandi_, were not long in reaching an\r\nagreement. Sanders did not want any share in the book or in the profits\r\nit might yield, but he was ready to do the work for a fixed compensation,\r\nin cash, and to be free from all responsibility for damages or loss. The\r\ncompensation, as represented by Sanders, was three thousand dollars.\r\nThe negotiations were consummated, announced through the press with\r\na brilliant flourish of trumpets, and the two gentlemen returned to\r\nKentucky in high feather. Work on the compilation (?) was soon commenced,\r\nand, as related by an eyewitness, the methods were very simple and\r\nexpeditious. Mr. Sanders sat at one side of a table with the three\r\nvolumes of “Wallace’s Trotting Register,” and _Wallace’s Monthly_ open\r\nbefore him, and as he read out the pedigrees in their alphabetical order,\r\nhis clerk, on the opposite side of the table, wrote them down. In a very\r\nfew weeks the work was done and Sanders put his three thousand dollars in\r\nhis pocket. Thus the clerk was paid, his employers were in possession of\r\nhis dishonest work, and J. H. Wallace was robbed of the labor of years,\r\nbut the instinctive honesty of the public conscience had not yet been\r\nreckoned with.\r\n\r\nThe book was published under the title of “The Breeder’s Trotting Stud\r\nBook.” The clerical work was well done, closely following the copyrighted\r\nsources from which it was drawn, so closely indeed as to furnish\r\nstrong _prima facie_ evidence that it was copied. But this feature of\r\nexcellence, if that word can be applied to theft in any form, furnished\r\nliterally hundreds of evidences, clear, unmistakable and conclusive,\r\nthat from beginning to end it had been copied from the “Register” and\r\nthe _Monthly_. Like all works of the kind, those volumes were not free\r\nfrom errors, the spelling of a name might be wrong, the initials of a\r\nname might have been misplaced or reversed, a date or a location may\r\nhave been incorrect, and as all these errors were copied and not one\r\nof them corrected, and there were hundreds of them, each one stood up\r\nas a competent and undisputed witness and told the story of the theft.\r\nBut, knowing the character of the people with whom I had to deal, I was\r\nprompted to adopt the methods of the detective in using marked bills,\r\nand then finding those bills on the person of the culprit. Fortunately\r\nthere was a very easy way of applying this effective and conclusive\r\nmethod and I adopted it. Instead of marking bills, I marked pedigrees,\r\nby inserting imaginary crosses. As an illustration, there was a horse\r\nin Delaware called Frank Pierce Jr. Nobody ever knew anything about the\r\nblood of his dam, and I supplied the place with “dam by Tom Titmouse,\r\npacer,” and then waited for my marked pedigrees to make their appearance.\r\nNobody ever heard of a horse called “Tom Titmouse” in Delaware or any\r\nother country. In due time the book appeared and there my “marked bills”\r\ncame to light in the possession of Lucas Brodhead and Henry C. McDowell.\r\nThe piracy was a clean sweep and the evidence of it was just as complete\r\nas the depredation itself. As a matter of course I did not delay in\r\nraising the shout “stop thief,” and after one or two broadsides from the\r\n_Monthly_ giving the extent of the theft and examples of the evidence\r\nto sustain the charge, the moral sense of the breeders of the whole\r\ncountry, including Kentucky, was aroused, and I was really surprised at\r\nthe sudden death of the bantling and its burial out of sight, but still\r\nmore surprised that no man opened his head in explanation or defense of\r\nthe piracy, and thus was practically confessed the truth of all that\r\nwas charged against them. It is said that Mr. Alexander, the proprietor\r\nof Woodburn, tightened the reins on his over-ambitious manager, at this\r\npoint, and admonished him that his course had done great injury to the\r\ngood name of Woodburn, and that he must change it, and not attempt any\r\ndefense of what he had done. Whether this really occurred or not I am not\r\nable to say, but it was just such a course as any wise employer would\r\nadopt toward a reckless employee whose course was destroying the good\r\nname of an establishment. It then appeared to be my duty to go forward\r\nand under a decree of the courts have this stolen property confiscated\r\nand destroyed, according to law, but as the bantling was already very\r\ndead and growing deader every day, with nothing left of it but a trace of\r\nits putrescence in the nostrils of all honest men, I concluded that the\r\ngame was not worth the candle.\r\n\r\nAmong the amusing things that were developed in the progress of this\r\ncontroversy was Mr. Brodhead’s peculiar views as to what “copyright”\r\nreally meant. He got the idea of restricting admission to the “Register”\r\nto animals possessing certain qualifications from the _Monthly_, and\r\nhe formulated this idea into five or six rules, expressed in eight or\r\nten short printed lines and, as he claimed, copyrighted this idea. He\r\nevidently seemed to think he had invented a rat-trap and got his patent\r\non it, and that no man dare make any rules restricting registration,\r\nso long as he safely held the patent on his rat-trap. He could see no\r\ndifference between a patent right and a copyright. An “idea” cannot be\r\ncopyrighted, no difference whether it be expressed in one printed line,\r\nor in a dozen. The copyright law is constructed for the special and only\r\npurpose of protecting the author in the results and products of his\r\nlabor. The work of seeking, tracing and establishing the pedigrees of\r\ntrotting horses had been pushed forward persistently, laboriously and\r\nexpensively for more than twelve years, and it had grown into a vast\r\naccumulation of facts of imperishable value to the whole horse world, and\r\nevery line of it was protected under the copyright law; but because it\r\ndidn’t conform to his “rat-trap” idea he seems to have persuaded himself\r\nthat it would be justifiable to hire and pay a man to transfer it from my\r\npossession to his own.\r\n\r\nDuring its very short life and while the memory of the book was retained\r\nin the recollections of the horsemen of that period, it was very\r\ngenerally, if not invariably, spoken of as “The Tom Titmouse Stud Book.”\r\nIt has already been suggested how this name would aptly fit in among my\r\n“marked bills,” but the reason for it has not been made apparent. In\r\nWarren’s romance called “Ten Thousand a Year,” his “delectable,” or to\r\nspeak soberly, his “detestable” hero was named “Tittlebat Titmouse,” and\r\nas one of the gentlemen involved in this controversy strongly reminded me\r\nof Warren’s hero, by his arrogance and ignorance, I involuntarily wrote\r\nin the “marked bill” “dam by Tittlebat Titmouse;” but upon looking at it\r\nI concluded it was not good bait, for it was doubtful whether any man in\r\nthe world who ever owned a horse would name him after so contemptible\r\na character. Hence, to make it less conspicuous it was changed to read\r\n“dam by Tom Titmouse, pacer,” and the bait was swallowed in a twinkling.\r\nThe Kentucky scheme, from its very inception, had its motive in securing\r\na local and personal advantage over the breeders of every other section\r\nof the country and hence the provisions of the “Pinafore” standard, from\r\nwhich the promoters were only driven by exposure and ridicule. The piracy\r\nwas consummated as proved by a hundred witnesses that will never die, and\r\nof which the “marked bill” element, such as “Tom Titmouse, pacer,” is an\r\nunmistakable representative. With the inception and consummation both\r\nunderstood and named, how could we find another name so fit as “The Tom\r\nTitmouse Stud Book?” To this might be added, on an amended title-page:\r\n“Edited by a clerk employed by Lucas Brodhead and Henry C. McDowell of\r\nKentucky.”\r\n\r\nSome three or four years after the death and burial of the “Tom Titmouse”\r\nbook and when its odoriferous memory had become less offensive, another\r\neffort was made to get control of the registration business, by the same\r\nparties in Kentucky. Mr. Brodhead did not appear prominently in this\r\nmove, but worked through his echo, McDowell. The plan was to present a\r\nmonster petition to the National Trotting Association, composed chiefly\r\nof track owners and track followers, to establish a trotting register.\r\nThis petition purported to be from breeders, but in fact it embraced\r\nall the “swipes” and stable-boys about Lexington and Woodburn, I was\r\ntold, and there were very few actual breeders in the list, and that few\r\nwere men who were trying to breed trotters from runners. The movement\r\nwas inspired and engineered in good degree from Woodburn, and Brodhead’s\r\nfriends were at work in all directions securing the names of the “rag,\r\ntag and bobtail” whose names appeared on the petition, and a very\r\ngreat noise was raised about what was going to be done. Whether the\r\nassociation took any action on the petition, or what it was, I have no\r\nrecollection, but whatever the disposition made of the petition, it never\r\nwas heard of again. To the reader not familiar with the condition of\r\nthings in Kentucky at that time, these persistent and renewed attempts\r\nto get control of the registration of trotting horses can hardly be\r\ncomprehended. They did not grow out of ruffled tempers merely, as the\r\nresult of friction, but out of strictly _business_ considerations.\r\nKentucky had a great variety of brood mares from which they were trying\r\nto breed trotters, and practically every one of them was tricked out\r\nwith more or less running blood as tail-pieces to their pedigrees, while\r\nothers were paraded with pedigrees showing a dozen or more successive\r\ncrosses by thoroughbred horses, and not one of them with a name, a\r\nhistory or a breeder. There were many purchasers flocking to Kentucky\r\nwith more money than knowledge for the purpose of buying a few animals\r\nto serve as the nucleus for a breeding stud, and it was no uncommon\r\nthing for such purchasers to estimate the value of a pedigree by its\r\nlength. When the purchaser got home with his stock, his next step was\r\nto send them to me for registration, and here came in the “business”\r\nconsideration. The pedigree having reached the office of the “Register,”\r\nunless it were already known to me, every cross had to be established\r\ncircumstantially and specifically before it could be accepted, and at the\r\nprecise point where reasonable information failed the pedigree was cut\r\noff. The purchaser then goes back upon the seller, and there the trouble\r\nbegins. He writes me an indignant letter. “You’re interfering with my\r\nbusiness, sah; that pedigree is just as I got it from Colonel Jones,\r\nsah; and he’s a gentleman, sah.” It was very seldom, indeed, that a man\r\nof this type could be mollified by assuring him that all pedigrees were\r\njudged by the same rule and requirement, whether they came from Maine or\r\nCalifornia or Kentucky. He generally remained an enemy to the “Register”\r\nbecause “it interfered with his business.” From early in the century,\r\nthree or four counties out of about one hundred and twenty in Kentucky\r\nbred running horses and grades and raced them, but no records were kept\r\nof their breeding and nobody knows with certainty to-day anything about\r\nthe more remote crosses. For a time the union of two or three trotting\r\nhorses upon the top of a line of nameless dams extending ten or fifteen\r\ngenerations was looked upon as the perfection of a trotting pedigree.\r\nThis notion, foolish as it was, gave Kentucky a great advantage over\r\nthe breeders of all other sections of the country, and every exposure,\r\nwith the evidence, that in nine cases out of ten these lines of nameless\r\ndams were in whole or in part pure fictions, was cutting the ground from\r\nunder their supposed superiority in the breeding of their trotters.\r\nUnder the arguments and illustrations of the _Monthly_, supported by\r\nthe incontrovertible statistics of the “Year Book,” the Kentucky cry\r\nfor “more running blood in the trotter,” was silenced as the child of\r\nignorance and prejudice, and instead of looking for pedigrees tracing\r\nback to Godolphin Arabian, everybody began to look for pedigrees that\r\ntraced to individuals and families distinguished for producing trotters,\r\nno difference what blood they possessed. Here the public mind reached\r\nthe truth, and in grasping it the boasted predominance of Kentucky was\r\ncrushed, and producing trotting blood was again placed on an equality in\r\nall parts of the land. The loss of the pretensions of one section could\r\nnot be of any specific pecuniary advantage to any other section, but the\r\nestablishing of the truth was of inestimable advantage to all. The loss\r\nof mere “pretentions” would not, in ordinary affairs, be considered a\r\nvery great loss, but in this instance it was looked upon as a grievous\r\nwrong, because it interfered with their “business.” Every slippery fellow\r\nwho failed to pass a bogus pedigree complained that it interfered with\r\nhis “business.” Every gang of cheats that got together and hired the use\r\nof a track for a few days for the purpose of giving their horses bogus\r\nrecords, when detected, cried out vigorously that this was interfering\r\nwith their “business.” Besides these, there were scores, perhaps\r\nhundreds, of others, ready for some such game to cheat the public, but\r\nwhen they learned the ordeal was severe, their courage failed and they\r\ncontented themselves by threatening the “Register” for interfering with\r\ntheir “business.” Here was an army of jockeys and cheats, and all they\r\nneeded to make their numbers formidable was a leader with courage and\r\nmoney, and whose “business” was their own, to seize registration and\r\nthus recoup the losses they had sustained in their “business.”\r\n\r\nIn considering the conspiracy that resulted in the sale and transfer of\r\nthe Wallace publications to the American Trotting Register Association,\r\nwhich means simply Lucas Brodhead, there are some antecedent conditions\r\nconnected with these publications that need a brief explanation. The\r\nfirst volume of “Wallace’s American Trotting Register” was published in\r\nthis city in 1871 and the second in 1874. An office was opened in this\r\ncity in 1875 and the first number of _Wallace’s Monthly_ was issued in\r\nOctober of that year. The National Association of Trotting Horse Breeders\r\nwas organized December 20, 1876. The attendance was large and many of the\r\nStates were represented by men of influence and standing. Mr. Charles\r\nBackman was elected president, and L. D. Packer secretary. From the favor\r\nwith which the idea of a national organization was received and from\r\nthe character of the men participating in it, I voluntarily and without\r\njudicial advice placed in the association the authority to appoint\r\nannually a Board of Censors to examine and decide all questions relating\r\nto disputed pedigrees sent for registration. The plan worked smoothly\r\nand satisfactorily for several years, in some of which there was not a\r\nsingle case to be examined. My publications were soon past the critical\r\npoint, and they seemed to grow from their inherent strength, and not from\r\npushing or advertising. The Breeders’ Association seemed to take the\r\nopposite chute, and after three or four years it became merely a name.\r\nAt first there was trouble in finding a man to take the presidency, but\r\nat last a rich dry goods merchant was found who was willing to take the\r\npresidency, and add five hundred dollars a year to some stake for the\r\nhonor conferred; and the secretary, L. D. Packer, was the mere satellite\r\nof the president, and was willing to give two weeks’ work every year for\r\nthe privilege of drawing a thousand dollars a year from the treasury. The\r\nannual meetings became a mere formality, with an attendance of three or\r\nfour and the two officers, who seemed to re-elect each other year after\r\nyear, until the association was finally buried somewhere out in Michigan,\r\nI think, and the money that had accumulated in the treasury was, on his\r\npetition, donated to the secretary in consideration of his valuable\r\nservices for so many years in carrying the association from the cradle to\r\nthe tomb.\r\n\r\nOwing to my relations to the Breeders’ Association, I felt that I was\r\nin honor bound to maintain its good name in the minds of the people,\r\nwhile every publication in the whole country was laughing at it, and that\r\nthis was my duty as well as my interest until the time came for a final\r\nseparation from it. True, when I made these efforts to uphold it I had to\r\nput my tongue in my cheek, for I knew that its management, like “the Old\r\nMan of the Sea,” was riding it to death. As my business continued to grow\r\nand prosper, I began to consider the propriety of forming a joint stock\r\ncompany of breeders, to own and control the property absolutely when I\r\nwas ready to retire. Greatly to my surprise this proposition gave offense\r\nto the two gentlemen who managed the association, for I had not alluded\r\nto that in any possible manner. When explained to me it became perfectly\r\nplain that the offense was in the fact that making a legal corporation to\r\nown and control the property would leave no “position” for the president,\r\nno salary for the secretary and no further need for the N. A. of T. H. B.\r\n\r\nThe Wallace Trotting Register Company, in due time, was incorporated\r\nunder the laws of the State of New York, and commenced business October\r\n1, 1889. The publications of the company were the “Register,” the\r\n_Monthly_ and the “Year Book.” The capital stock of the company was fixed\r\nat one hundred thousand dollars, and as work came pouring in upon us\r\nmore rapidly than we could handle it, labor became a burden and I had no\r\ntime to distribute this stock among the breeders of every State, as I\r\nintended. This was the condition of things in the office in the following\r\nspring when, to my horror, I discovered I had been robbed of something\r\nover fifty-four thousand dollars and the thief escaped to Cuba. The\r\nblow was a stunner, and messages of sympathy came pouring in from all\r\nquarters, with many tenders of pecuniary assistance all of which were\r\nthankfully acknowledged, but all tenders of assistance were declined.\r\n\r\nThe capitalization at one hundred thousand dollars, and the robbery of\r\nfifty-four thousand dollars, and the company still not crushed, gave Mr.\r\nBrodhead a new view of the possibilities of the future, and inspired him\r\nwith a new hope that he might yet reach the ambition of his life and\r\ngain control of the registration of all the trotting pedigrees of the\r\ncountry. Without much violence to the processes of Brodhead’s mind we can\r\nimagine the way in which he reasoned out the problem. “This has become a\r\nvaluable property and is bound to be still more valuable,” he doubtless\r\nreasoned, “and it is possible it can be bought, but if bought it must be\r\ndone before that stock is scattered among the breeders of the different\r\nStates. There are Russell Allen and Malcolm Forbes and a whole lot of\r\nrich fellows just coming into the trotting horse business and I can show\r\nthem that this property would be a good investment. With the money in\r\none hand and the bluff of starting an opposition Register in the other,\r\nit is possible the property might be got for something like its value.”\r\nHe next probably reasoned: “The first thing to consider here, is how to\r\nmake that bluff sufficiently imposing and effective, in an authoritative\r\nway; and shall it be a mass meeting or a delegate meeting, and where\r\nshall it be held? I have seen Packer and he evidently wants to know what\r\nthere is in it for him and Mali, in case they agree to call a National\r\nconvention. They want to perpetuate their offices in their present\r\nso-called National Association. If it should be a mass convention, and\r\nheld at Chicago, I could send up a few carloads of farmers’ sons from\r\naround here and every one of them would swear he was a breeder. If it\r\nshould be a delegate convention from State Breeders’ Associations, there\r\nare several States that have no such associations, but I could get a\r\nfew friends to organize for the purpose of sending delegates. The horse\r\npapers would be a unit on our side, for they have been ‘set on’ so often\r\nand so hard that they would like to see the old bear superseded. Beside\r\nthis, every one of those papers has at least the one man who is competent\r\nto succeed Wallace, and every editor who has been in the business six\r\nmonths thinks he is fully qualified for that place. But the real roar of\r\nthe shouting would come from the angry men whom Wallace has disappointed\r\nin refusing to accept their pedigrees or their performances because they\r\nwere irregular. These men are very numerous and we must have as many of\r\nthem present as possible. I think this plan will work,” he doubtless\r\nreasoned with himself, “if we can only keep Wallace in the dark till we\r\nget things fixed, and to throw him off his guard I will send him three or\r\nfour pedigrees to register.”\r\n\r\nThus the plan of the conspiracy, with all the elements to be employed,\r\nwere evidently matured in Mr. Brodhead’s mind. There were two points\r\nabout which he was specially solicitous. The first was that I should\r\nbe kept wholly in the dark as to his movements and purposes, and the\r\nsecond was some apparently official authority for calling a convention at\r\nChicago that would be of a nominally “national” character. On invitation\r\nSecretary Packer visited Woodburn, and for a promised consideration it\r\nwas all arranged that the President and Secretary of the N. A. of T. H.\r\nB. would call a convention. With the initial step thus safely provided\r\nfor, Mr. Brodhead was everywhere, east and west, north and south, beating\r\nup recruits. In a short time, evidently by preconcerted arrangement,\r\nthere was an unusual number of horsemen in town, some of them very rich\r\nmen, while the greater number were blowers of the Dr. Day type with a\r\ngrievance. The horsemen were hustled together by Secretary Packer, in\r\nwhat was called an impromptu meeting, and there President Mali, after\r\nsome apparent hesitation, fulfilled his part of the agreement and called\r\nthe convention at Chicago, and thus Mr. Brodhead secured his share—and we\r\nwill see how the other side fared further on.\r\n\r\nWhen the convention assembled at Chicago it was indeed a motley mass.\r\nPresident Mali took his place as president, and called the convention\r\nto order, and Secretary Packer took his place as secretary. This, as I\r\nunderstand, was not by the choice of the convention, but by virtue of\r\ntheir positions in the N. A. of T. H. B. It was eventually determined\r\nthat the meeting should be composed of delegates from State associations,\r\nand when the associations were called, several of them had never been\r\nheard of before and never have been heard of since. They were bogus\r\nassociations, and were gotten up especially for the occasion. Some of the\r\ndelegates bore names that never had been heard of in the office of the\r\n“Register,” and it may be inferred they never bred a standard horse. The\r\nnames of others, again, were well known in the office from their efforts\r\nto get spurious and unknown crosses accepted. All these men were anxious\r\nfor a new management. One man whom I had discharged from my office a few\r\nweeks before represented a New England State. He was guilty of a flagrant\r\nattempt at deception. He was a fawning sycophant, always laughing at his\r\nown supposed wit, and he was known in the office as “Uriah Heep.” The man\r\nwho dominated the convention from beginning to end had not been appointed\r\na delegate by his own association. The whole thing, as a convention,\r\nwas about as hollow a sham as was ever enacted in Chicago. Next behind\r\nthe gentlemen who by courtesy may be designated as delegates, sat the\r\nmoneyed men who were anxiously looking for a good investment for some\r\nof their loose funds, and Brodhead had told them this property was\r\npaying twenty-five per cent. on a capitalization of one hundred thousand\r\ndollars, and he thought it could be made to pay more. Like many other\r\nfools, they thought it was a machine that when fired up in the morning\r\nwould run itself. Next to the rich men sat a good sprinkling of farmers’\r\nsons, some carloads of whom had been brought from Kentucky, and all ready\r\nto swear they were breeders. As Brodhead explained this incident to a\r\ngentleman who stated it to me: “If there was any attempt to pack the\r\nconvention he was ready to do some packing himself, with these young men\r\nhe had brought from Kentucky.”\r\n\r\nOn the outside circle there was a large number of young men and some\r\nolder ones watching the proceedings with great intensity. They were\r\nrestless, and some of them looked hungry, and every one of them was\r\nlooking for a place if the purchase went through. One had a copy of the\r\nBungtown _Bugle_ in his pocket containing a report of the racing at the\r\nlast county fair, written by him, and he thought that was sufficient\r\nevidence that he was qualified to take charge of the _Monthly_. Another\r\nhad made, with his own hands, as he asserted, a tabulated pedigree on\r\na large scale and shaded the letters beautifully and artistically with\r\npokeberry juice; and what evidence could be more satisfactory that he was\r\nqualified to take charge of the department of registration? Every one of\r\nthem seemed to think that there would be a good place for him in the new\r\ndeal, and hence his enthusiasm at every incident that seemed to point in\r\nthat direction. Thus the little cormorants as well as the big cormorants\r\nwere all anxious for the prey.\r\n\r\nWhile the soreheads were wrangling over how best to get hold of my\r\nproperty, and what they would do with it when they got it, I had several\r\nhours in the privacy of my own apartments to look over all the conditions\r\nof the situation, and the conclusions I then reached I have never had\r\nreason to change. It, therefore, may be of interest to all to know just\r\nwhat I thought at that crucial period, and I will give these thoughts as\r\ncontemporaneous with the event:\r\n\r\n“This meeting is a miserable sham, but the action of Mali and Packer\r\nhas given it a pseudo-type of regularity as a national convention of\r\nhorsemen, and this idea of ‘regularity’ will carry weight with many who\r\nknow nothing of the bottom facts.\r\n\r\n“The members of the press will, substantially, be a unit against me, and\r\nring all the changes on ‘the National convention’ at Chicago, and labor\r\nto make it appear as an uprising of the horsemen of the whole country\r\nagainst me.\r\n\r\n“The meeting is packed by Brodhead with his own satellites whose expenses\r\nhe has paid, and embraces a good many rogues who have failed in passing\r\nupon me dishonest pedigrees and spurious records. Besides these there are\r\nseveral men here, and very active, whose names have never been heard of\r\nbefore in the horse world.\r\n\r\n“Taking these elements together, they are in numbers more formidable than\r\ndangerous, but when led by Brodhead, with what they consider a fair price\r\nin one hand and a club in the other, with the demand ‘take the price or\r\nwe’ll take the property,’ the occasion becomes serious.\r\n\r\n“The latter alternative means a battle that may last ten years. Ten years\r\nago these same people employed a man who purloined my literary property\r\nand it was found in their possession. The evidence of the piracy was so\r\nclear that it never was denied.\r\n\r\n“Have I time enough, am I strong enough, am I young enough to enter upon\r\nthis long battle? Ten years ago I was robbed of my property, but I was\r\nthen vigorous and strong; one year ago another thief robbed me of my\r\nmoney and it was a terrific and lasting strain upon my vitality.\r\n\r\n“The days of my years number nearly threescore and ten, so there is no\r\ntime to enter upon the uncertainties ‘of the law’s delays.’ From overwork\r\nand the anxieties growing out of family afflictions and the robbery, my\r\nhealth is shattered. It is time, therefore, that I should seek to rest\r\nrather than to struggle.\r\n\r\n“And what about the work to which I have devoted the best years of a\r\nlong life? Will it be attacked? Certainly it will be attacked for the\r\nreason that it does not suit Woodburn. Will it be overthrown? No, the\r\nlaws of nature cannot be overthrown. The trotter can come only from the\r\ntrotter and nobody but an ignoramus or a fool can doubt the truth of this\r\ndeclaration. The experiences of every year, of every track, and in every\r\nrace confirm this central truth and will continue to do so as long as the\r\nworld stands.”\r\n\r\nFrom the above reasonings and conclusions, when the offer of one hundred\r\nand thirty thousand dollars was made, in a business form, it was accepted.\r\n\r\nWhen the property was transferred it was on the individual and joint\r\nresponsibility of some half a dozen rich men, and they were as gleeful\r\nand happy over their investment as though they had obtained a gold mine\r\nfor a song. But, while these men were rejoicing over their acquisition,\r\nthere were many others cursing the deception that had been practiced upon\r\nthem by promising them places and perquisites and, in short, whatever\r\nthey wanted in order to secure their adherence to the conspiracy. Of\r\nall this numerous class, Messrs. Mali and Packer had so little sense as\r\nto make the nature and terms of their agreement public, namely, that\r\nthey were to be clothed with the power to annually appoint the Board of\r\nCensors for the new organization. Poor fools! they didn’t know Brodhead.\r\nFor a consideration of place they had betrayed a trust to him that as\r\nhonorable men they should have sacredly guarded, and the more they\r\ncomplained the more bitterly they were condemned by all right-thinking\r\nmen. Hence, after they had served his purpose he kicked them aside as\r\nhe would an old shoe, and thus he punished the traitors with whom he\r\nhad dealt. When the multitude of writers, statisticians, etc., who had\r\nreceived private assurances of “something equally as good” in the new\r\ndeal, saw the fate of Mali and Packer, they had sense enough to keep\r\ntheir mouths shut. A man who knew anything about the trotting families\r\nand their lines of descent was not the kind of man that Mr. Brodhead\r\nwanted to put in charge of registration. The only man who could suit\r\nMr. Brodhead was the man who would implicitly and without doubt follow\r\nhis instructions, right or wrong. When Mr. J. H. Steiner was appointed\r\nRegistrar it was wholly evident that this was the purpose of the\r\nproprietor, for of all the men in my knowledge, in any way connected with\r\ntrotting horse interests, Mr. Steiner seems to be the most profoundly\r\nignorant of horse history and horse lineage, and till this day he does\r\nnot seem to have learned anything thereof.\r\n\r\nAt this point the public confidence received a shock from which it has\r\nnever recovered, and never will recover. From that day till the present\r\nthe estimate of value of the publications of the company, in the minds\r\nof breeders, has been on the “down grade,” and coupled with this is the\r\never-obtruding doubt as to whether these publications are managed for\r\nthe advantage of the general breeding public, or for the little clique\r\nof which Woodburn is the center. The lack of knowledge displayed has\r\nresulted in a profound disgust. This has been shown most conclusively in\r\nthe fate of the poor old _Monthly_. It started out under its new owners\r\nto controvert breeding history and breeding law in which the public had\r\nbeen thoroughly and conscientiously indoctrinated. The sham pretense\r\nof using the title _Wallace’s Monthly_ instead of _Brodhead’s Monthly_\r\nwas “too thin” to deceive any one except the most ignorant. The labored\r\nproductions of the weaklings hired to overthrow the truth only tended to\r\ndeepen the disgust. The price was lowered as an inducement to support,\r\nbut nobody wanted the miserable thing about his house, and thus it died\r\nwithout a tear except from the eyes of the rich fools who put their money\r\ninto it supposing it would live and prosper in the hands of ignorant and\r\nincompetent men.\r\n\r\nIt is natural for the rich men who put their money so gleefully into this\r\npublishing enterprise, at the instigation of Mr. Brodhead, to try to\r\nget some of it back before the final smash, which is evidently not far\r\nremoved, and hence the ignorant and blundering emasculation of the Year\r\nBook, in order to reduce its cost. “The Great Table,” as it was called\r\nfor years, embraces all others, and all others are merely subsidiary to\r\nthat. This table should be restored in its entirety, for it is worth the\r\nwhole of them and double as many more. With every other table thrown\r\nout and this one restored, complete, the breeders would be content. The\r\nYear Book—the great instructor of the past—I have just learned is no\r\nlonger published for the breeders or for the press, but for the tracks.\r\nThe operation is explained as follows: Every year the secretaries of the\r\nNational and the American Trotting Associations send out by express a\r\nlot of blank books, blanks, etc., to each track in good standing and in\r\nthis outfit for the year is a copy of the Year Book, which is charged\r\nat the long price. The tables of fastest records, I am told, are quite\r\ncarefully made in the offices of these associations themselves, and the\r\nbook is thus made a convenience for the tracks. Thus, by this system of\r\nforced loans on the tracks, the Year Book is kept alive. This method of\r\nfinancing the company will not last long.\r\n\r\nA different method has been adopted in order to secure funds from\r\nregistration. Money for registration must come from the breeders\r\nthemselves directly, and there is no way of forcing them to put up\r\nthrough the manipulation of intermediary officials. Hence the plan has\r\nbeen tried of scaring them into it, but with what success I am not\r\ninformed. At the annual meeting in April, 1895, I think it was, a\r\ncommittee was appointed, consisting of Messrs. Brodhead and Boyle, if I\r\nremember, to consider and report to the next meeting amendments to the\r\nstandard advancing the requirements for registration, and everybody was\r\nadvised to hurry in their pedigrees or they might be excluded. At the\r\nmeeting in 1896 the committee did not report, but Mr. Brodhead reported\r\nin a series of resolutions, in which the number of standard dams was\r\nadvanced, which suited Woodburn exactly, but there was no advance in\r\nthe time to be made, and the tin-cup record against time was carefully\r\nprotected. The resolutions were adopted unanimously, and went before the\r\nbreeding public as the new advanced standard that would be decided at the\r\nnext annual meeting. From time to time the breeders were duly informed\r\nof the proposed advance and cautioned many times to get in while they\r\ncould. The annual meeting in April, 1897, came, and instead of a rush of\r\nbreeders interested one way or another in the proposed advance, the same\r\nstereotyped half a dozen men were there who had been manipulating the\r\nscare for two years, and not one of them, even Brodhead himself, voted\r\nfor the advance. This is no advance at all, in a practical sense, and\r\nwould accomplish nothing, and would do no good to anybody except Woodburn\r\nor some other establishment that like her has been breeding trotters for\r\nforty years. It was merely intended for a scare, and it failed under such\r\ncircumstances as to fully disclose the object in placing it before the\r\nbreeders. The scare is all out of this kind of humbug and deception, and\r\nnow what? When the standard was adopted on the basis of 2:30 that rate\r\nof speed was sixteen seconds behind the fastest record then made. To-day\r\nif the standard were placed at 2:20 it would be about sixteen seconds\r\nslower than the fastest time now on record. But this real advance,\r\nwhich is imperatively demanded by all the considerations of philosophy\r\nand progress, will never be made so long as the standard is under the\r\ncontrol of Woodburn. The reason for this is made obvious by reference to\r\npage 504, etc. Mr. Brodhead’s ambition has been fully gratified, he is\r\nin full and absolute control of the registration of the country, he has\r\ncompletely demonstrated his incompetency for such a position, and he has\r\nthe satisfaction of knowing, if it be a satisfaction, that no sensible\r\nbusiness man on the face of the globe would be willing to pay ten per\r\ncent. of the cost for the property he now controls. And who will say\r\nthis is not a righteous retribution for the disreputable means employed,\r\nfirst and last, to obtain this control?\r\n\r\nMy life-work in building up a breed of trotting horses and thereby adding\r\nmany millions to the value of the horse stock of the country had been\r\nmore effective than I had even hoped for. I knew that I had laid the\r\nfoundation on the bed-rock of truth, and I knew that the superstructure\r\nhad been honestly erected, but I did not know what a deep root my\r\nteachings had taken in the minds of all intelligent and thinking men. In\r\ntransferring the property the chief source of my unhappiness was in the\r\nthought that heaven and earth would be moved to destroy what I had done\r\nand overthrow what I had taught. But I had builded wiser and stronger\r\nthan I knew, and when the “feather-weights” were hired to pull the house\r\ndown and tear up the very roots of the seed I had planted, the people\r\nwould not listen to them and nobody would read their vapid utterances.\r\nAnd thus the effort ended in the death of the _Monthly_. The harvest\r\nof thought was much nearer the reaping time when the transfer was made\r\nthan I had supposed, and since then it has been ripening and ripening,\r\nand to-day if any man were heard advocating more running blood in the\r\ntrotter, he would with very great unanimity be pronounced either an\r\nignoramus or a fool, on that question at least.\r\n\r\nBut, much as I disliked to surrender my life-work to a man whose moral\r\nfiber I had tested and found brittle, the transfer was really “a\r\nblessing in disguise.” It gave me rest, it gave me health, and it gave\r\nme leisure to prosecute the study of the horse of history in fields\r\nhitherto untrodden. The years thus employed in digging after the very\r\nroots of history in the libraries, at home and abroad, have glided by,\r\naffording a continuous enjoyment in the discovery of many things that are\r\nvery old and yet entirely new to this generation. Very often, when the\r\nwork went slowly, I thought I could again hear the quiet, sympathetic\r\nvoice of a Pennsylvania Friend gently prompting me with the remark,\r\n“Thee should remember that thee is no longer a young man.” And now that\r\nmy long-promised and pleasant undertaking is completed, it is my very\r\nearnest wish that the thousand friends who have been waiting for it may\r\nenjoy the pleasant surprises it will furnish them as much as I have\r\nenjoyed their exhumation from the archives of long-buried centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE WALLACE PUBLICATIONS.\r\n\r\nBY A FRIEND OF THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wallace’s early life and education—Removal to Iowa,\r\n    1845—Secretary Iowa State Board of Agriculture—Begins work,\r\n    1856, on “Wallace’s American Stud Book,” published 1867—Method\r\n    of gathering pedigrees—Trotting Supplement—Abandons Stud\r\n    Book, 1870, and devotes exclusive attention to trotting\r\n    literature—“American Trotting Register,” Vol. I., published in\r\n    1871—Vol. II. follows in 1874—The valuable essay on breeding\r\n    the forerunner of present ideas—Standard adopted 1879—Its\r\n    history—Battles for control of the “Register”—_Wallace’s\r\n    Monthly_ founded 1875—Its character, purposes, history,\r\n    writers, and artists—“Wallace’s Year Book” founded 1885—Great\r\n    popularity and value—Transfer of the Wallace publications, and\r\n    their degeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the series of works known as the Wallace publications,\r\neven in the brief form here contemplated, involves in a large degree the\r\nbiography of Mr. Wallace. It is indeed more than the sketch of a long and\r\nindefatigably industrious life-work. It involves as well, in the forty\r\nyears of creative labor, the development of a great productive industry,\r\nand of a distinct branch of literature. Mr. Wallace’s labors in the\r\nfield of gathering and systematizing American horse history began at a\r\nday when there was no breed of trotters, or no trotting literature. When\r\nhe laid aside active work there were both, well established and clearly\r\ndefined factors in the nation’s progress, and in all the years from the\r\ncommencement he was the central figure in the work of establishing a\r\nbreed of trotters, and incomparably the clearest and strongest force in\r\nthe direction and upbuilding of a trotting literature. That is the simple\r\ntruth of history, which the verdict of time will render it puerile to\r\ndeny.\r\n\r\nJOHN H. WALLACE was born August 16, 1823, and reared on a farm in\r\nAllegheny County, Pennsylvania. As a boy he evinced no particular liking\r\nfor farm work, but had a great fondness for reading. He was educated\r\nchiefly at the Frankfort Springs Academy, where he was prepared to\r\nenter the junior class at college. There occurred a little incident at\r\nthis time that illustrates how seemingly slight a thing may change the\r\ncurrent of a life. The then member of Congress for that district, Mr.\r\nDickey, a scholarly man, advised Professor Nicholson, of the Academy,\r\nthat if he had a young man in his institution whom he could recommend,\r\nhe (Mr. Dickey) would appoint him a cadet to West Point. Mr. Wallace\r\nwas selected, provided his father’s consent was forthcoming. When Mr.\r\nWallace, Sr., was approached on the subject his reply was, “John, I\r\nthink there is some better employment in the world for you than studying\r\nthe most approved methods of killing men”—and that ended the West Point\r\nincident. Young Mr. Wallace, about this time, became alarmed, however,\r\nat his then persistently delicate health, and decided to seek an outdoor\r\nlife rather than one of study. In 1845 he married Miss Ellen Ewing (who\r\ndied in 1891), of Fayette County, Pennsylvania, and settled on a farm at\r\nMuscatine, Iowa. Iowa was then a new country, and Mr. Wallace did much\r\nin the way of organizing the industrial and educational interests of the\r\nState. There, as related below, he began work in the line in which he\r\nbecame famous. With an invalid wife he returned to Allegheny in 1872; and\r\nin 1875 in company with the late Benjamin Singerly, of Pittsburg, started\r\n_Wallace’s Monthly_ at New York, which has been his home ever since. Mr.\r\nWallace in 1893 married Miss Ellen Wallace Veech, a niece of the first\r\nMrs. Wallace; and since his retirement from active business he has spent\r\nhis time, at home and abroad, chiefly in prosecuting investigations into\r\nthe horse history of the remote periods, the results of which are seen in\r\nthis, his crowning life-work.\r\n\r\nWe will endeavor here to sketch, in the abstract, the history of Mr.\r\nWallace’s publications to as great a degree as possible separately,\r\nthough they cannot be entirely separated. The “Trotting Register” was an\r\noutgrowth of the “Stud Book,” and _Wallace’s Monthly_ and the “Year Book”\r\noutgrowths of the “Register,” and both auxiliary thereto. The career\r\nand usefulness of all were intertwined, yet each had its own peculiar\r\nmission, and to that extent their histories will be kept distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n“WALLACE’S AMERICAN STUD BOOK.”\r\n\r\nDuring the early “fifties” Mr. Wallace, then in the prime of early\r\nmanhood, was Secretary of the Iowa State Board of Agriculture, and as\r\nsuch had much to do with the management of State fairs. He was thus\r\nfrequently called upon for information about the pedigrees of animals,\r\nand the need of an authority on horse pedigrees was pointedly and\r\nconstantly forced upon his attention. If the pedigree of a cow was asked\r\nfor he had only to turn to the “American Herd Book” to find it, but when\r\nthe breeding of a horse was wanted there was no authority to which to\r\nturn. Mr. Wallace had been dabbling more or less in such horse literature\r\nas there was at that day, and in 1856 began collecting information with\r\nthe ultimate purpose of publishing a stud book of thoroughbred horses—for\r\nthe thoroughbred was then here, as in England, supreme as the only horse\r\nof literature. He already possessed certain of the publications that\r\nwere the best horse authorities of the day—a file of the _Spirit of the\r\nTimes_, Skinner’s _American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine_, and\r\na number of volumes of the “English Stud Book,” and English _Sporting\r\nMagazine_. Added to these, later, were other sources of information and\r\nmisinformation most notable in this latter class being the alleged “Stud\r\nBook” published by Patrick Nesbitt Edgar, of North Carolina, in 1833—an\r\nutterly unreliable work, but the only American stud book in existence\r\nprior to Wallace’s. From these, and every other available source, Mr.\r\nWallace began to glean and systematically compile the pedigrees of\r\nthoroughbred and so-called thoroughbred horses. Of these sources by far\r\nthe most valuable was Skinner’s periodical, begun in Baltimore in 1829.\r\nNovice as he was at the time, Edgar’s work was regarded with more than\r\nsuspicion by Mr. Wallace, and, as a matter of caution as well as of\r\nhonesty, whenever he borrowed pedigrees from Edgar they were so credited.\r\n\r\nModern methods of investigating pedigrees were not dreamed of by our\r\ncompiler then. His principal aim seems to have been to get as large\r\na collection as possible, and whatever was found in print, whether\r\nnewspaper, book, or hand-bill, was taken for granted; and pedigrees\r\ngathered from private sources were, like the others, submitted to\r\nlittle scrutiny. Neither men’s motives nor their knowledge of what\r\nthey represented to know were questioned, and in this way, after years\r\nof labor, a great mass of pedigrees was gathered, written in new form\r\nand order, and the thoroughbred stallions numbered—which was the first\r\ninstance of numbering horses in registration. While compiling the\r\nthoroughbred pedigrees, Mr. Wallace also incidentally seized upon such\r\ninformation as he found about trotting pedigrees and records, and these\r\nhe arranged as an appendix to his work. Finally, in 1867, “Wallace’s\r\nAmerican Stud Book,” a great, handsome volume of 1,017 pages, bound\r\npretentiously in green and gold, was published in New York.\r\n\r\nThe trotting supplement embraced about 100 pages, and that the editor was\r\npretty well satisfied with it is shown by a sentence in the preface: “It\r\nis believed that this compilation of trotting horses, embracing over 700\r\nanimals, is very nearly perfect, but it is not claimed to be entirely\r\nso.” Of course, from the method of its compilation it was decidedly\r\nimperfect, but it was the best and only compilation of trotting pedigrees\r\nup to that time.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Wallace was pushing forward the compilation of the second\r\nvolume of the “Stud Book,” and in this traveled much, making personal\r\ninvestigations. In 1870 this was completed, all the ground up to that\r\nyear having been gone over, but in the course of the work “a great light”\r\nbegan to dawn upon the compiler. He found that he had been proceeding on\r\na wrong plan entirely. Experience in compiling and investigating taught\r\nhim that a pedigree may be printed in a newspaper, or even in a book, and\r\nstill not be true. He discovered that the sources from which he had drawn\r\nwere largely unreliable, that hundreds of pedigrees, through ignorance or\r\ndishonesty, or both, were fabrications and frauds, especially in their\r\nextensions in the maternal lines, and with the realization in full force\r\nof this knowledge came the determination, even though the last page of\r\nthe manuscript for the second volume of the “Stud Book” was complete,\r\nthat it should never see the light.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Mr. Wallace had discovered that the trotting supplement\r\nwas the part of his “Stud Book” most used and appreciated. He saw that\r\nthe trotter was coming to be the horse of the American people, and that\r\nthere was a great and new field opening in which a literature had yet\r\nto be formed. His experience with the “Stud Book” gave him the training\r\nnecessary for the work before him, and thus equipped, with little capital\r\noutside of his newly acquired knowledge, and marvelous natural industry\r\nand perseverance, with an unusual capacity for hard work, he turned in\r\n1870 to the work before him—the literature of the trotter.\r\n\r\n\r\n“WALLACE’S AMERICAN TROTTING REGISTER.”\r\n\r\nHe had as a nucleus the supplement to Volume I. of the “Stud Book,”\r\nadded to which was the work done and knowledge gained in compiling the\r\nsecond volume, together with an increasing library and written data.\r\nThus in incidentally adding a few pages of trotting pedigrees to his\r\n“Stud Book,” Mr. Wallace had builded better than he knew, but he even\r\nnow had little conception of the extent and richness of his new field\r\nof exploration. He traveled all over the country, levying upon every\r\nsource of information for his “Trotting Register;” but, taught in the\r\ndear school of experience, depended chiefly upon personal investigation,\r\ntaking monthly and yearly less and less for granted. He gradually became\r\nmore trained in meeting the natural human fondness for embellishing,\r\nextending and completing pedigrees without reference to fact or evidence,\r\nand the equally common predilection for stating as known facts those\r\nthings concerning pedigrees that were only of common report. This work\r\nwas excellent training for the more extended duties of the future, and\r\nit gave Mr. Wallace an insight into methods of the olden time, and a\r\nknowledge of men and horses that later made him, backed by uncompromising\r\nhonesty, absolute fearlessness, and a quite unusual disregard for\r\n“policy,” a “terror to evil-doers” in the realm of manufacturing in whole\r\nor in part fraudulent pedigrees.\r\n\r\nStill the knowledge, the caution, the system that made it almost\r\nimpossible in the last years of Mr. Wallace’s administration to impose\r\na fraud upon the “Register” were of slow, gradual, but constant growth.\r\nThe work improved with every volume, with every year of experience, and\r\nthe evidence that would be accepted in the compilation of the early\r\nvolumes would not suffice later. Mr. Wallace had also the quality of just\r\nas remorselessly overthrowing his own errors as those of others, and\r\nthus a system of correction was continually going along, in which work\r\n_Wallace’s Monthly_, founded in 1875, was a particularly effective agency.\r\n\r\nThe first volume of the “Trotting Register” was published in 1871,\r\nand was a neat book of 504 pages. It contained, besides the pedigrees\r\ngathered, tables of all trotting and pacing performances up to the close\r\nof 1870, and this was the first time in which the records of the trotting\r\nturf were collected and published. This part of the work entailed a\r\nvast amount of research, including a thorough review of all sporting\r\npapers, annuals and other sources where contemporaneous record of racing\r\nwould be liable to be made, but it was a very valuable feature; and,\r\nbesides serving as a basis for Mr. Wallace’s future compilations, was\r\nunscrupulously seized upon by imitators who, from time to time, sought to\r\npublish “record books.”\r\n\r\nThere was also an introduction to the volume entitled, “An Essay on\r\nthe True Origin of the American Trotter,” which showed a glimmering of\r\nunderstanding of the truths of history and of breeding as now understood\r\nby students well grounded in the subject. In the second volume, however,\r\nwas an essay that marks an epoch in the literature of breeding. Written\r\nless than three years after the introduction to Volume I., it betrays\r\nthe fact that in the intervening years the author had risen suddenly\r\nand broadened infinitely in his study of the science of breeding, and\r\nhis understanding of the application thereto of the facts of trotting\r\nhistory. It advanced then entirely new views, and it was the first\r\narticle published, as far as the writer is aware, that rose to an\r\nappreciation of the supremacy of biological laws in horse breeding,\r\nand suggested such a thing as psychical heredity in the transmission\r\nof habits of action. It originated the term “trotting instinct,” so\r\ngenerally used thereafter, began the discussion of the problem of the\r\nincreasing number of fast trotters from pacing ancestors, and wound\r\nup with ten sound propositions or conclusions based throughout on\r\nthe law that like begets like. It opened up new and endless lines of\r\ninvestigation and thought, and at once elevated the discussion to a\r\nscientific plane. This article, written by Mr. Wallace originally for\r\nthe _Spirit of the Times_, marked the advent of the school of thought on\r\nbreeding now almost universal.\r\n\r\nThe second volume of the “Register” was published in 1874, and the third\r\nin 1879. The first three volumes of the “Register” contained about 10,000\r\npedigrees, and the statistical tables in the second and third volumes\r\nwere greatly improved and amplified over those in the first. Volume II.\r\ngave a table of sires of 2:30 horses, with the number to the credit of\r\neach sire, and the number of heats to the credit of each performer—a sort\r\nof vague foreshadowing of the famous “Great Table of Trotters under their\r\nSires,” later to be conceived and developed by Mr. Wallace, and destined\r\nto become the most valuable single trotting compilation yet designed, and\r\nthe one now universally used, adopted and imitated. This volume also gave\r\na table of 2:25 trotters to the close of 1873, arranged in the order of\r\ntheir speed. The first table of trotters under their sires was published\r\nin _Wallace’s Monthly_, covering the statistics to the end of 1877.\r\n\r\nThe third volume was much larger than its predecessors. The industry\r\nof breeding trotting and pacing horses was, under the stimulus of the\r\n“Register” and _Wallace’s Monthly_, and other agencies with which Mr.\r\nWallace was identified, and of a general era of prosperity then dawning,\r\nadvancing and extending now at rapid strides, and about this time\r\ncertain events of almost inestimable influence on the future of the\r\nbusiness transpired.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1876 there was formed at New York the National\r\nAssociation of Trotting Horse Breeders, an organization in which Mr.\r\nWallace’s influence predominated from its inception until a short time\r\nbefore its dissolution, for lack of an excuse for existence. This\r\norganization was broadly representative of the best elements in the\r\nbreeding business in its virile and useful days, and accepted a sort\r\nof advisory and supervisory control over the “Trotting Register;” and\r\nVolume III. and subsequent volumes were compiled under its authority.\r\nQuestions of disputed pedigrees and other such issues affecting breeding\r\nand the record of pedigrees were decided by a Board of Censors appointed\r\nby this association; and, aside from its usefulness in connection with\r\nthe “Trotting Register,” it contributed largely to the advancement and\r\nencouragement of breeding by inaugurating colt stakes, and other stakes\r\ndesigned more especially to attract the breeder than the professional\r\ncampaigner.\r\n\r\nBefore the third volume was through the press the need of some measure\r\nfor restricting registration became apparent to Mr. Wallace. The\r\neconomics of the “Register” demanded it, but beyond this the need\r\nof systematizing and establishing a specific breed called for some\r\ndefinition as to what rightfully belonged to that breed. Up to this time\r\nthe only rule was the indefinite provision that “anything well related\r\nto trotting blood” might be acceptable as eligible by the compiler of\r\nthe “Register.” The problem that confronted those who took a broad\r\nand comprehensive view was to educate public opinion up to that point\r\nwhere the possibility of establishing a breed of trotters would be\r\nappreciated. As early as April, 1878, _Wallace’s Monthly_ strongly urged\r\nthe necessity of a standard, and this was the first suggestion of one\r\nthat had been made. At the November meeting of the National Association\r\nof Trotting Horse Breeders that year the Board of Censors in their report\r\npresented a letter from Mr. Wallace advising the adoption of a standard,\r\na recommendation which the Board indorsed. Meanwhile the matter was\r\nbeing agitated and discussed in _Wallace’s Monthly_, and affairs were\r\ngradually shaping for action. In the March, 1879, number of the _Monthly_\r\na standard formulated by certain Kentucky breeders and forwarded by Major\r\nH. C. McDowell was printed and commented upon. It was fair on its face,\r\nbut under discussion its weak points were made clear. For instance, its\r\nfourth rule made standard “Any mare the dam of any mare or stallion\r\nthat has produced or sired a horse, mare, or gelding with a record of\r\n2:30.” It was pointed out that under this rule the celebrated English\r\nthoroughbred mare Queen Mary would become a standard trotter, for her\r\nson, the race horse Bonnie Scotland, had sired the trotter Scotland.\r\nAs other provisions made the sisters and brothers of standard animals\r\nstandard, the defects of the Kentucky standard were made patent, and the\r\nBreeders’ Association failed to approve it. Instead, at a meeting at the\r\nEverett House, New York, November 19, 1879, the standard as printed on\r\npages 519-20, in the framing of which Mr. Wallace and General B. F. Tracy\r\ndid the active work, was unanimously adopted.\r\n\r\nUnder this standard the work of compiling Volume IV., which involved\r\nbringing forward animals registered in preceding volumes, that met its\r\nrequirements, and numbering stallions, was carried on.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, some Kentucky gentlemen failed to acquiesce in the standard\r\ndecision, and had, or believed they had, other grievances against\r\nthe compiler of the “Register.” They proceeded to plan to control\r\nthe “Register.” but as in the last chapter of this work Mr. Wallace\r\ngives full details of this and subsequent battles for the control of\r\nregistration, this history need not be here repeated.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the breeding interest was enjoying remarkable prosperity,\r\nand this was reflected upon and through the “Trotting Register” and\r\n_Wallace’s Monthly_. In 1882 Volume IV. was published, Volume V. in 1886,\r\nand Volume VI. in 1887, these containing about 6,000 pedigrees each.\r\nVolume VII. appeared in 1888, Volume VIII. in 1890, and Volume IX., the\r\nlast published by Mr. Wallace, appeared in 1891.\r\n\r\nWhile an adequate discussion of the standard is neither necessary or\r\npossible in this article, it was so obviously part and parcel of the\r\n“Trotting Register” that its history must be briefly outlined. The\r\nstandard formulated in 1879 served its purpose well, but it was but an\r\ninitial step, and it was fully recognized by Mr. Wallace at the time that\r\nit would have to be revised and strengthened from time to time so as to\r\nkeep pace with the progress of the breeders. If the standard to-day is\r\nheld in slight esteem, or even in contempt, it is clearly because it has\r\nbeen allowed to lag far behind the progress of the breed.\r\n\r\nEvils grew out of the standard, even in its early years, simply through\r\na quite general misunderstanding of its purposes and its full meaning.\r\nStandard rank became instantly so popular and so sought after that\r\nthousands of breeders aimed solely to breed into the standard, without\r\nmuch regard for other necessary qualifications. They seemed to forget\r\nthat it was merely a definition of the blood that was eligible to\r\nthe “Register,” and not, nor ever intended, to be taken as a general\r\nmeasuring stick of value. Soon after its adoption an era of great\r\nprosperity came in trotting affairs, with recklessly high prices for\r\nstandard animals. With an apparently insatiable market there came an\r\nabnormal expansion of the industry. Thousands of men began breeding\r\nwithout knowing anything, either practically or theoretically, about the\r\nindustry, except how to get into the standard. Hence the overproduction\r\nof not only standard trotting horses, but all kinds of trotting horses\r\nof inferior breeding and little excellence, and the subsequent break in\r\nprices, for all of which the standard has been by inconsiderate persons\r\nblamed.\r\n\r\nNot long after its adoption Mr. Wallace saw these dangerous tendencies,\r\nand in the _Monthly_ warned the breeders against them, and early began\r\nagitating for a revision of the rules. But nothing could stem that\r\nrising tide, and at first the opposition to any change in the rules was\r\nvehement and general. The obviously easy gateway into the standard was\r\nthrough rule seven, and this became the storm center of the discussion.\r\nMr. Wallace led in the call for the abolition of this rule, and did\r\nit so persistently and well that gradually the leading breeders and\r\nthinkers were won over, but the outcry against a change was so earnest\r\nand so general among the smaller breeders that the National Association\r\nhesitated long. Though a Committee on Revision was appointed as early as\r\nDecember, 1885, it was not until December 14, 1887, that a revision was\r\nfinally effected, the standard being then adopted as printed on pages\r\n520-21.\r\n\r\nEvery reader can observe, by comparison with the previous standard,\r\nthat there was a wise and conservative strengthening of the rules all\r\nalong the line. The next step contemplated by Mr. Wallace was not only\r\na further restricting revision on blood lines, but also an increase in\r\nthe speed rate required, an advance from 2:30 to 2:25, then ultimately\r\nto 2:20, his purpose being that the standard should keep pace with the\r\nprogress of the breed. But before any of these steps were made the\r\n“Register” passed into other hands—and other theories and practices have\r\nprevailed, with the result that the standard is to-day held in derision\r\nand the value of the “Register” has sunk to the vanishing point. But\r\nbefore reaching this phase of our history some account of Mr. Wallace’s\r\nother publications is in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n“WALLACE’S MONTHLY.”\r\n\r\nAt a very early period in the history of the “Trotting Register”\r\nMr. Wallace perceived the necessity of there being some medium of\r\ncommunication with the breeders which he could control. This was one of\r\nseveral reasons, which need not here be detailed, the outcome of which\r\nwas the establishment of the publication which has played a greater part\r\nthan any other in developing the trotting literature of to-day, and in\r\nleading American thought on the science of breeding—_Wallace’s Monthly_.\r\nThe first number came out in October, 1875, with Benjamin Singerly,\r\npublisher, and John H. Wallace, editor. Mr. Singerly was an uncle of Hon.\r\nWilliam M. Singerly, of the Philadelphia _Record_, and had large printing\r\nestablishments in Harrisburg and Pittsburg, Pa. The first twelve numbers\r\nof _Wallace’s Monthly_ were printed in Harrisburg, though published from\r\nthe outset from New York. Benjamin Singerly died in August, 1876, from\r\nwhich time Mr. Wallace carried on the publication himself, from the\r\nlittle office at 170 Fulton Street, overlooking St. Paul’s churchyard.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the time-honored custom in journalism, the first\r\nnumber of _Wallace’s Monthly_ contained a salutatory outlining its\r\npurposes and its policy, and in almost every detail that policy was\r\nhonestly lived up to while Mr. Wallace controlled the magazine. The horse\r\nwas to be made the leading, but not the exclusive feature; full trotting\r\nand running summaries with indexes were to be published; correspondence\r\nwas invited; and, as a cardinal principle of policy, gambling in any and\r\nall forms was to be uncompromisingly fought against. This last detail\r\nof policy Mr. Wallace rigidly adhered to always. He opposed public\r\nbetting in any form and under any pretense, and believed, and acted up\r\nto the belief, that if racing could not be maintained without betting it\r\nwere better that grass should grow on the tracks. The first number of\r\nthe _Monthly_ contained a descriptive article by “Hark Comstock,” and\r\nsome selected matter, but was chiefly the editor’s work—mostly concise\r\nhistorical matter, dealing with the early progenitors of the trotting\r\nbreed.\r\n\r\nWith each number the _Monthly_ strengthened, until soon it had gathered\r\naround it the brightest writers in the country. Notwithstanding this,\r\nhowever, the editorial department was always its strongest feature, and\r\nit rapidly became a power in the land. Among the earliest contributors\r\nwere “Hark Comstock” (Peter C. Kellogg), always a fluent writer, and one\r\nof the most versatile special pleaders on horse topics known to the turf\r\npress; Charles J. Foster, the gifted “Privateer,” whose work, from a\r\nliterary standpoint, was oftentimes a model of finish; “Yah Amerikanski”\r\n(Spencer Borden), and “S. T. H.” (S. T. Harris), both brilliant,\r\nespecially in controversy; H. T. Helm, Levi S. Gould, and many others\r\nprominently known in turf literature a quarter of a century ago.\r\n\r\nSpirited controversy early became a feature of the _Monthly_, and in\r\nthese passages-at-arms the editor was generally found taking a leading\r\nhand. As a writer Mr. Wallace was always above all things forceful. He\r\nfortified himself in theory and fact amply, and his style was so direct,\r\nyet comprehensive, that every shot told, and even those who disagreed\r\nwith him were forced to read and admire these spirited discussions. Mr.\r\nWallace moreover early impressed the public with his uncompromising\r\nhonesty, and with the fact that, above all things, he had the courage of\r\nhis convictions. There was no dodging issues, no dallying or compromising\r\nwith humbug of any sort; a spade was called a spade, and no consideration\r\nof “policy” brought a note of indirection into the _Monthly’s_ editorial\r\npages. The personality of the editor was ineffaceably stamped on his\r\nmagazine, and its influence became potent for good far beyond the\r\nlimitations of mere circulation.\r\n\r\nThe magazine became quickly the leader in thought on breeding subjects,\r\nand hardly an advanced idea that to-day prevails in this field of\r\nliterature but can be found first suggested in the _Monthly_. The first\r\ntable of trotters under their sires was published in _Wallace’s Monthly_\r\nfor 1877; the standard was first suggested in its pages; the pacer as an\r\norigin of trotting speed was first advanced in February and March, 1883;\r\nit was the first to formulate and advocate and put to the test a scale of\r\npoints for judging horses; and above all it was the power that educated\r\nbreeders to an understanding of breeding on truly scientific principles,\r\nand brought about an acceptance and appreciation of the laws of heredity\r\nas applied to breeding the trotter. And, interspersed with this\r\ncontinual seeking for the light and the right, there was an amount of\r\nhistorical matter published that would make the compilation of a valuable\r\nbook on the American trotter possible from the _Monthly_ alone. It was,\r\nmoreover, continually exposing frauds of history and of pedigrees, and\r\nwas as potent in guarding as it was in discovering the truth. It was the\r\nrecognized enemy of fraud, of humbug, of false pretense everywhere, and\r\nattacked them in high places as well as low, and that its editor incurred\r\nthe enmity of many whose designs attracted the _Monthly’s_ searchlight,\r\nand were thwarted by it, is a fact known of all men.\r\n\r\nThis, in brief, was the character of the _Monthly_ from its foundation,\r\nuntil it passed out of Mr. Wallace’s hands. To follow its detailed\r\nhistory through the nearly sixteen years of Mr. Wallace’s editorship is\r\nnot the purpose of this article, but the rather to group the salient\r\nfactors that made it what it was, and that have secured for it an\r\nenduring place in trotting history.\r\n\r\nThe _Monthly_ was from the first illustrated, and the progress in\r\nhorse art is well demonstrated by tracing through its pages. Its first\r\ndrawings were made by James C. Beard, who came of a race of artists, but\r\nwhose attempts at horse portraits were wretched caricatures, one and\r\nall. Still, they seemed to be the best, or rather the least bad, then\r\nobtainable. Mr. Wallace, however, was painfully cognizant of the lack of\r\ntruthful portraits of horses, and was not less delighted than surprised\r\nwhen, one September day in 1878, a young man came into his office, and\r\nexhibited drawings that were so obviously truthful portraitures that\r\nthey were a revelation in horse art. A rapid questioning as to whether\r\nhe had drawn them, and where he had hidden his light so long, developed\r\nthat the young genius was Herbert S. Kittredge, of Pennsylvania. He\r\nwas immediately engaged, and his work in the _Monthly_ was the first\r\nreputable horse portraiture in American literature. This gifted,\r\nself-educated genius died in May, 1881, long before his prime, and when\r\nhis powers were daily developing. He was the forerunner of Whitney,\r\nDickey, Morris, and others whose ability to faithfully portray horses is\r\nacknowledged to-day. He had not the mechanical aids—notably the camera—or\r\nprocesses which they so freely call into play, but in true artistic\r\nability to draw faithfully, it is doubtful whether this undeveloped\r\nmaster was the inferior of any artist who has yet made horse portraiture\r\na specialty in any country.\r\n\r\nFrom year to year the contributory staff of _Wallace’s Monthly_\r\nincreased, and always had in its membership a number of the leading\r\nbreeders and students. For many years Mr. Wallace did practically all the\r\neditorial work himself, as in fact he did the registration work. But this\r\ngradually outgrew him, and soon his office staff began to increase. First\r\nhe removed the office to 212 Broadway, not far from its first location.\r\nThen in May, 1887, the final move was made to commodious offices in the\r\nStewart Building, at Broadway and Chambers Street, when the office staff\r\nhad grown until more than a dozen assistants were employed on all the\r\npublications.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest editorial assistants on the _Monthly_ was C. T.\r\nHarris, later trotting editor of the _Spirit of the Times_, and still\r\nmore recently of _The Horse Review_, a faithful and conscientious worker.\r\nLater Gurney O. Gue, a clever writer, and exceptionally well grounded in\r\nfacts of pedigree and record, occupied a desk with the _Monthly_, and is\r\nnow one of Mr. Dana’s “bright young men” on the _Sun_. In 1886 Leslie E.\r\nMacleod became associate editor, and continued in that capacity until\r\n1890. He subsequently became managing editor of _The Horseman_, and later\r\neditorial writer of _The Horse Review_.\r\n\r\nOf contributors, among the best known may be named, in addition to those\r\nenumerated as identified with the _Monthly_ at the start, General B.\r\nF. Tracy, Allen W. Thompson, Samuel Hough Terry, “Mark Field” (Jas. M.\r\nHiatt), “O. W. C.” (O. W. Cook), Thos. B. Armitage, “Mambrino” (H. D.\r\nMcKinney), Otto Holstein, “Bill Arp,” “Aurelius” (Rev. T. A. Hendrick),\r\nA. B. Allen, “Fidelis,” Harvey W. Peck, Benjamin W. Hunt, “Roland”\r\n(Leslie E. Macleod), Major Campbell Brown, F. G. Smith, Judge M. W.\r\nOliver, Prof. Chas. T. Luthy, Colonel F. G. Buford, John P. Ray, “Vision”\r\n(W. H. Marrett), H. C. Goodspeed, and others.\r\n\r\nThe last number of _Wallace’s Monthly_ issued under Mr. Wallace’s\r\neditorship was published in July, 1891. It then passed to the American\r\nTrotting Register Company, at Chicago, and its degeneration was rapid,\r\nand in a few months it died for lack of brains. Robbed of its virility\r\nand of its purpose, without editorial direction, and aiming only to lead\r\na _harmless_ existence, and to say or do nothing to offend any one of a\r\nscore of directors and hundreds of stockholders, it soon began to lead a\r\n_useless_ existence, and dropped out of the notice of thinking men. It\r\nbecame the antithesis of all that it had been, and its end was a pitiable\r\none for a publication with a history of sixteen years of fearless,\r\nhonest, able direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n“WALLACE’S YEAR BOOK.”\r\n\r\nEarly in the history of the _Monthly_ Mr. Wallace decided to drop\r\nrunning summaries, and give exclusive attention to trotting and pacing\r\nstatistics. These grew so rapidly that they soon became burdensome,\r\nand an outlet became inevitable. Furthermore the adoption of the\r\nstandard, depending as it did on records of performances, necessitated\r\nfor its application a bureau of statistics, and these considerations\r\nand others—not the least of which was the recognition of “a long-felt\r\nwant”—prompted Mr. Wallace to start “Wallace’s Year Book.” The first\r\nvolume of this valuable annual was published in May, 1886, covering the\r\nperformances for 1885, and contained, besides summaries of all races in\r\nwhich a heat was trotted in 2:50 or less, a 2:30 list for the year, and\r\nthe Great Table of Trotters under their sires. The book contained 273\r\npages, was bound in flexible cloth, and sold at $1.\r\n\r\nAn improvement of the greatest value and importance was made in the Great\r\nTable in the first volume of the “Year Book.” This was the addition after\r\nthe list of performers under each sire of the names of his sons that\r\nhad sired performers, with the number to the credit of each, and of the\r\nperformers out of his daughters. It furnished at a glance what a horse\r\nhad done, not only of himself, but through his sons and daughters, and\r\nthe Great Table thus improved became at once the gauge of trotting blood\r\nby which breeders everywhere estimated the comparative values of the\r\ndifferent families and different sires. It was the most clear, condensed,\r\nyet comprehensive and perfect summing up of all the facts and experiences\r\nof trotting history imaginable, and so apparent is this fact that nothing\r\noriginal has ever been attempted to replace it, while all compilers,\r\nwithout exception, imitate it. The Great Table of itself would have\r\ncarried any book to success.\r\n\r\nThe second volume of the “Year Book,” 330 pages, contained in addition to\r\nthe same class of matter as its predecessor, tables of sires and dams,\r\ngreat brood mares, and fastest records. Still further improvements were\r\nmade in every year. Volume VI., published for 1890, was a handsomely\r\nbound book of 642 pages, with summaries of all races in which heats were\r\ntrotted or paced in 2:40 or better, list of best records slower than\r\n2:40, complete 2:30 lists with extended pedigrees, the Great Table with\r\nthe pedigrees of the sires extended, list of 2:20 trotters according to\r\nrecords, list of 2:20 trotters under their sires, list of great brood\r\nmares, sires of dams, mares the dams of producing sons or daughters,\r\ntables of fastest records, champion trotters from 1845 to 1890, champions\r\nat all ages from yearlings to five-year-olds, champion stallions, table\r\nof 2:20 pacers, and of 2:30 pacers under sires. No such comprehensive and\r\nvaluable mass of statistics was ever arranged, and this volume was in\r\nitself a perfect encyclopedia of trotting literature.\r\n\r\nNo eulogy of the “Year Book” is necessary, for every farmer’s boy knew\r\nbefore it was three years old that it was indispensable to all horsemen.\r\nIt instantly bounded into a place of authority, and to thousands who\r\nfelt the “Register” out of reach it was at once “Stud Book” and “Racing\r\nCalendar,” and none of Mr. Wallace’s creations performed a wider public\r\nservice, or attained a popularity so broadcast and sudden. The new work\r\nwas peculiarly fortunate in having back of it the authority of the\r\n“Register,” and the prestige of a name that had already become world-wide\r\nas rendering everything it bore authoritative—but even allowing for\r\nthese advantages the quick popular indorsement of the “Year Book” was an\r\neloquent testimony to the wisdom of its plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nThe Wallace Trotting Register Company, with a capital of $100,000, was\r\norganized in 1889, and October 1, of that year, all the publications\r\nbecame the property of this company. The last chapter of this book\r\ndetails the final transfer to the American Trotting Register Association\r\nin 1891.\r\n\r\nWith the fortunes of the Wallace publications since that transfer it\r\nmay be, perhaps, questioned whether this sketch has anything to do, and\r\nyet it would seem incomplete without the sequel. As already stated,\r\n_Wallace’s Monthly_ degenerated to nothing and died. The “Year Book” has\r\nbeen emasculated until it is but a shadow, incomplete and unsatisfactory,\r\nof what it was, and is notoriously published at a loss. Its once great\r\ntables are cut from their complete state to be merely the tables of\r\na single year, and where one complete “Year Book” was in the Wallace\r\n_régime_ the only hand-book necessary, now the student must rummage\r\nthrough half a dozen, more or less, to ascertain the simplest series of\r\nfacts. The standard has been mismanaged, revisions have been made and\r\nrescinded, and no advance has been made in the speed qualifications,\r\nthough 2:20 trotters are as common to-day as 2:30 trotters were in 1891.\r\nIn consequence, registration has fallen away, and from being a good\r\npurchase at $130,000 in 1891, the “Register” properties to-day are rated\r\nso dubiously far below par as to make the expression of their value in\r\nfigures hardly possible. That a period of “hard times” came shortly after\r\nthe purchase of the “Register” is true—but the practical wrecking of the\r\nWallace publications cannot be accounted for solely on the theory of\r\nbusiness depression.\r\n\r\nSuch in brief outline has been the story of the founding of these works,\r\nwhich in their own upbuilding helped incalculably to upbuild one of\r\nthe nation’s great industries. The present works may be destroyed or\r\npass away, but the true Wallace works cannot. Mr. Wallace’s works have\r\na place in horse history, secure, unique, alone. Created, we might say\r\nfrom nothing, they each and all grew and prospered in his care and\r\nguidance, and became powers for good and auxiliaries of industry. If he\r\nis a benefactor who causes two blades of grass to grow where one grew\r\nbefore, how much the more is he whose labor and genius have enriched ten\r\nthousand farms, and been the most potent single influence in developing\r\na productive industry the extent of which can only be estimated in\r\nmillions. Mr. Wallace’s works will live after him. In speaking once on\r\nthe transient nature of fame, a distinguished lawyer, a man of national\r\nreputation, said: “After I am gone I will be remembered as a successful\r\nlawyer among many other successful lawyers, but Mr. Wallace’s name\r\nwill live as long as a horse exists on the earth.” We rarely judge\r\ncontemporaries justly. It needs the softening perspective of time in\r\nwhich to lose the dimming prejudices of the present; and however much\r\nthese works may be appreciated to-day, their true worth, what they\r\naccomplished, and the productive genius, purposeful industry, and plain,\r\nconsistent honesty from which they were evolved will only be clearly seen\r\nand fully conceded by the historian of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A\r\n\r\n    Aaron Pennington, 451, 452.\r\n\r\n    Abdallah, 20, 237, 261, 267, 275, 311, 316, 332, 336, 389, 414.\r\n\r\n    Abdallah (Alexander’s), History of, 272, 294, 296, 297, 298,\r\n    299.\r\n\r\n    Abdallah Chief (Roe’s), 311.\r\n\r\n    Abdallah, History of, 255, 261.\r\n\r\n    Abdallah Mambrino, 299.\r\n\r\n    Abdallah Pilot, 297.\r\n\r\n    Aberdeen, 275, 311, 414.\r\n\r\n    Abiri (strong horses), 39.\r\n\r\n    Abraham in Egypt, 36.\r\n\r\n    Acquired Characters and Instincts, 471.\r\n\r\n    Acrelius, Rev.
