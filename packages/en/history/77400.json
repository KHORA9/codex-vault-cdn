The drawings have been made expressly\r\nfor this work from the best examples.\r\n\r\nThe seventy-eighth proposition is the only instance in which there is\r\nan omission of the illustrative drawing, and this occurs in all the\r\ncopies; the two drawings which are now supplied to that proposition\r\nhave been made from the descriptions given in the text.\r\n\r\nFor the Translation of Hero from the Greek, the valuable assistance of\r\nMr. J. G. Greenwood, Fellow of University College, London, has been\r\nobtained: he is the recently appointed Professor of the Languages and\r\nLiterature of Greece and Rome, in Owen’s College, Manchester.\r\n\r\nIt is confidently hoped that this Translation will be found superior to\r\nits predecessors in whatever language; and that it will prove not only\r\ngenerally interesting but practically useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decorative border of curled leafy vines.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning Hero of Alexandria, the author of the treatise here\r\ntranslated, little is known with certainty. When his name and the place\r\nof his abode have been given, all that can be positively affirmed is\r\nexhausted. We are further told by Hero the younger, who is supposed to\r\nhave written in the seventh century A. D., that Hero, the author of\r\nthe “Pneumatics,” was a pupil of Ctesibius;—a statement sufficiently\r\nprobable from the character of his works, and strengthened by the\r\ninscription Ἥρωνος Κτησιβίου[1] prefixed to another work by Hero on the\r\nconstruction of missiles.\r\n\r\nEven the precise period at which Hero lived is a debated point. From\r\nhis own writings all that can be gathered is that he knew the works\r\nof Archimedes, and of Philo the Byzantian, who, again, is known to\r\nhave been a contemporary of Ctesibius; and, as the earliest mention of\r\nhim by others is as low down as the fourth century A. D., external\r\nevidence, even if it were distinct, would be little trustworthy. Such\r\nevidence, however, is vague and scanty. The only direct statement\r\nbearing on the date of Hero is the assertion that he was the pupil of\r\nCtesibius. The date of Hero therefore depends on the date of Ctesibius,\r\nand this has been variously fixed by different chronologists.\r\n\r\nClinton, (F. H. vol. iii. pp. 535, 538,) who puts Hero as low down\r\nas the end of the second century B. C., proceeds on the following\r\nevidence: Athenæus (vol. iv. p. 174, edit. Schweighæuser) quotes one\r\nAristocles as saying, in a work περὶ χορῶν, of the water-organ, φασὶ\r\nτοῦτο εὑρῆσθαι ὑπὸ Κτησιβίου κουρέως ἐνταῦθα οἰκοῦντος ἐν τῇ Ἀσπενδίᾳ\r\nἐπὶ τοῦ δευτέρου Εὐεργέτου· διαπρέψαι τέ φασι μεγάλως. Now Euergetes\r\nII. (Ptolemy VII.) reigned from B. C. 170 to B. C. 117, and hence\r\nClinton assigns Hero, the pupil of Ctesibius, to the reign of Ptolemy\r\nVIII. that is, to B. C. 117–81.\r\n\r\nFabricius, on the other hand, (Bibi. Græc. vol. iv. pp. 222, 234,\r\nedit. Harl.) setting out from an entirely different datum, places him\r\nmore than a hundred years earlier, in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus\r\n(Euergetes I.): Athenæus Mechanicus, (one of the mechanical writers\r\nwhose works are printed in the _Veterum Mathematicorum Opera_), in his\r\ntreatise περὶ μηχανημάτων, p. 8, speaks of Ctesibius as a contemporary;\r\nhis words are Κτησίβιος ὁ Ἀσκληνὸς, ὁ ἐν Ἀλεξανδρείᾳ μηχανικός. This\r\ntreatise is dedicated to a Marcellus, and Fabricius, assuming, after\r\nHero junior, this Marcellus to be the conqueror of Syracuse, has hence\r\nassigned Ctesibius and Hero to the reigns of the second and third\r\nPtolemies (B. C. 285–222).\r\n\r\nOf these conflicting dates that assigned by Clinton has been generally\r\nadopted. The question is discussed at some length by Schweighæuser,\r\nin a note on the passage of Athenæus referred to above: he deems the\r\nidentification of the patron of Athenæus Mechanicus with the conqueror\r\nof Syracuse to be unwarranted, and, besides, thinks it most unlikely\r\nthat at so early a period a Greek should dedicate a work on military\r\nengines to any Roman. But from the expression employed by Athenæus,\r\n(ὦ σεμνότατε Μάρκελλε,) it may be inferred that his patron was a\r\nman of very exalted rank; and the second objection from the alleged\r\nimprobability that a Greek should dedicate such a work to a Roman at\r\nthat period will hardly be thought to apply at the period referred\r\nto, while the skill displayed by Marcellus in the siege of Syracuse,\r\nand the regret expressed by him for the fate of Archimedes, (whether\r\ngenuine or not,) may well have suggested the dedication to him of\r\na work on military engineering. The assumption of Fabricius, then,\r\nis, in itself, not to be too hastily rejected; and it will be seen\r\nthat it is not so irreconcileable with the statement of Aristocles\r\nas has been supposed. Fabricius has carried back the date further\r\nthan his argument requires or even warrants. Marcellus was killed B.\r\nC. 208: Athenæus might have inscribed his work to him about B. C.\r\n212 or 210; at this period, then, we must suppose Ctesibius to have\r\nbeen known as a philosopher,[2] but he may have lived far into the\r\nsucceeding century,—possibly even into the reign of Euergetes II. (B.\r\nC. 170–117); Hero would thus be placed about B. C. 150, a result by\r\nno means inconsistent with the statement of Aristocles, since it is\r\nnot necessary, with Clinton, to assign the whole of the long reign of\r\nEuergetes II. to Ctesibius, and then to put Hero so low down as the\r\nreign of Ptolemy VIII.\r\n\r\nThe treatise on Pneumatics was first published in an Italian\r\ntranslation by Aleotti (Bologna, 1547). In 1575 appeared a Latin\r\nversion by F. Commandine (Urbino, 1575): this translation, through\r\nwhich the work has been most extensively known, was reprinted at\r\nAmsterdam and at Paris. Several other translations were made into\r\nItalian, and one into German (see Fabricius, iv. p. 235). It was not\r\ntill the year 1693, and subsequently to the appearance of all the\r\nversions named above, that the Greek text was published at Paris in\r\nthe _Veterum Mathematicorum Opera_. The design of this collection was\r\nformed by Thevenot, deputy librarian of the Royal library in the reign\r\nof Louis XIV., and after his death it was carried out by De la Hire.\r\nThevenot’s plan was to publish an accurate transcript of the MSS. of\r\nthe several authors. The inevitable obscurity arising from the numerous\r\ncorruptions which had crept into the manuscripts was to be remedied by\r\nan appendix of notes and a Latin translation. But for the Pneumatics of\r\nHero it seemed sufficient to adopt the already well-known translation\r\nof Commandine; and, in consequence, of the eight MSS. of this treatise\r\nexisting in the Royal Library, that one was chosen which most nearly\r\nagreed with the Latin version. This MS. was closely followed, and,\r\nas might be expected, the printed text is extremely corrupt: not\r\nunfrequently entire clauses are wanting, which, ending with the same\r\nword as the clause preceding, seem to have been passed over by the\r\ntranscriber, whose eye, in returning from his copy to the original,\r\nrested on the second instead of the first of the two similar words.\r\nThese defective passages, which appear to have been conjecturally\r\nrestored by Commandine, have been supplied in the present translation\r\nfrom MSS. of Hero preserved in the British Museum. These MSS. are\r\ndescribed in the appendix, where the most important cases in which the\r\nprinted text has been supplemented, or otherwise amended, from this\r\nsource are collected. When any words are included in the translation\r\nbetween brackets, it is to be understood that they appear neither in\r\nthe text nor in any of the MSS. collated, but have been inserted as\r\nnecessary to the sense.\r\n\r\nThe other treatises of Hero are:—1. On the construction of slings. 2.\r\nOn the construction of missiles. 3. On automata. These are published in\r\nGreek and Latin in the _Vet. Math._ 4. On the method of lifting heavy\r\nbodies. This treatise has not yet been edited: it exists only in an\r\nArabic translation. 5. On the “dioptra” or spying-tube: also inedited.\r\nIt exists in manuscript in the Royal Library at Vienna, and among the\r\nMSS. of Hero contained in the Library of the University of Strasburgh.\r\nSchweighæuser in his notice of these MSS. (ap. Fabric. iv. p. 226),\r\nintimates that this treatise is of much interest, and contains an\r\naccount of the dioptra “newly invented or improved by Hero himself.”\r\nSome help might perhaps be derived from it towards the settlement of\r\nHero’s date, as the dioptra is mentioned and minutely commented on by\r\nPolybius. Several other treatises, entirely lost, are enumerated by\r\nFabricius, iv. p. 236.\r\n\r\nA question of great interest presents itself as to the claim of\r\nHero to be considered as the inventor of the several machines and\r\nmethods described by him. In the introduction of the “Pneumatica” he\r\ndeclares that his purpose is to arrange in order the discoveries of\r\nhis predecessors, and to add to them his own. The treatise on the\r\nconstruction of missiles is ascribed in some MSS. to Ctesibius, (as\r\nin one at Leyden, Fabric. iv. p. 229,) while at the end of a MS. of\r\nthe same work in the Library of Vienna are these words, τέλος τῶν\r\nἈρχιμήδους Βελοποιΐκῶν, τῶν ἐξηγηθέντων παρὰ Ἥρωνος Κτησιβίου. Again,\r\nit is singular that neither Pliny nor Vitruvius has any reference to\r\nHero, though Ctesibius and his inventions are repeatedly mentioned.\r\nVitruvius (x. 7) minutely describes a machine for raising water to a\r\ngreat height, which he expressly ascribes to Ctesibius; and in the\r\nfollowing chapter he treats, at great length, of the construction\r\nof water-organs, yet without any notice of Hero. Both Pliny and\r\nVitruvius expressly name Ctesibius as famous for his skill in the\r\ninvention of pneumatic and hydraulic instruments. Pliny’s words are\r\n(vii. 38) “Laudatus est Ctesibius pneumatica ratione et hydraulicis\r\norganis repertis.” Vitruvius, (x. 7, compare also ix. 8,) after his\r\ndescription of the machine for raising water, says “Nec tamen hæc sola\r\nratio Ctesibii fertur exquisita, sed etiam plures et variis generibus\r\nab eo liquore pressionibus coacto spiritus efferre ab natura mutuatos\r\neffectus ostenduntur, uti merularum aquæ motu voces, atque engibata,\r\nquæ bibentia tandem movent sigilla, cæteraque quæ delectationibus\r\noculorum et aurium usu sensus eblandiuntur.” He refers the curious to\r\nthe commentaries of Ctesibius himself. How well this description of\r\nCtesibius’ inventions suits the general character of those preserved\r\nby Hero, will be manifest at once. Vitruvius, as Schneider has pointed\r\nout,[3] seems to have had no knowledge of Hero’s Pneumatics, as both\r\nthe forcing-pump and the water-organ differ in several important\r\nparticulars from those of Hero: he does not even notice the application\r\nof the forcing-pump in extinguishing conflagrations. This silence on\r\nthe part of Vitruvius and Pliny, so remarkable on the supposition that\r\nHero was an original discoverer, is more easily accounted for if we\r\nregard him rather as the interpreter of Ctesibius.[4]\r\n\r\nFor further details on the life and writings of Hero, the reader\r\nis referred to Fabricius, iv. pp. 222–239, Smith’s Dictionary of\r\nBiography, and Baldi _de Vita Heronis_, in his edition of the Belopœica.\r\n\r\n                                                                J. G. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nJan. 31, 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This has, indeed, been conjectured to be an error for Ἥρωνος ἢ\r\n Κτησιβίου, but Baldi (in his edition of the Belopœica, p. 44,) has\r\n satisfactorily proved that Hero was the writer.\r\n\r\n[2] That Ctesibius began his researches at an early age may be inferred\r\nfrom the fact mentioned by Vitruvius, ix. 9. (edit. Schneider.)\r\n\r\n[3] On Vitruvius, x. 7. The sections of Hero and the corresponding\r\nchapters of Vitruvius are minutely compared by Schneider, Vitruv. vol.\r\niii. pp. 283–330.\r\n\r\n[4] Baldi arrives at the same conclusion: (p. 74) “Cæterum haud\r\nimmerito quispiam dubitaverit quam ob rem Architectus Heronis nostri\r\nnomen silentio præterierit. Nos ideo factum putamus quod ille Ctesibio\r\nutpote inventori ea tribuere maluerit quæ ab Herone locupletiora et\r\nillustriora quam ipse a magistro accepisset evulgata fuere.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRIGENDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Page 4, line 3, _for_ them _read_ it.\r\n      14, figure.

We are further led to write this work from the\r\nconsideration that it is fitting that the treatment of this subject\r\nshould correspond with the method given by us in our treatise, in four\r\nbooks, on water-clocks. For, by the union of air, earth, fire and\r\nwater, and the concurrence of three, or four, elementary principles,\r\nvarious combinations are effected, some of which supply the most\r\npressing wants of human life, while others produce amazement and alarm.\r\n\r\nBut, before proceeding to our proper subject, we must treat of the\r\nvacuum. Some assert that there is absolutely no vacuum; others that,\r\nwhile no continuous vacuum is exhibited in nature, it is to be found\r\ndistributed in minute portions through air, water, fire and all\r\nother substances: and this latter opinion, which we will presently\r\ndemonstrate to be true from sensible phenomena, we adopt. Vessels which\r\nseem to most men empty are not empty, as they suppose, but full of\r\nair. Now the air, as those who have treated of physics are agreed,\r\nis composed of particles minute and light, and for the most part\r\ninvisible. If, then, we pour water into an apparently empty vessel,\r\nair will leave the vessel proportioned in quantity to the water which\r\nenters it. This may be seen from the following experiment. Let the\r\nvessel which seems to be empty be inverted, and, being carefully kept\r\nupright, pressed down into water; the water will not enter it even\r\nthough it be entirely immersed: so that it is manifest that the air,\r\nbeing matter, and having itself filled all the space in the vessel,\r\ndoes not allow the water to enter. Now, if we bore the bottom of the\r\nvessel, the water will enter through the mouth, but the air will escape\r\nthrough the hole. Again, if, before perforating the bottom, we raise\r\nthe vessel vertically, and turn it up, we shall find the inner surface\r\nof the vessel entirely free from moisture, exactly as it was before\r\nimmersion. Hence it must be assumed that the air is matter. The air\r\nwhen set in motion becomes wind, (for wind is nothing else but air\r\nin motion), and if, when the bottom of the vessel has been pierced\r\nand the water is entering, we place the hand over the hole, we shall\r\nfeel the wind escaping from the vessel; and this is nothing else but\r\nthe air which is being driven out by the water. It is not then to be\r\nsupposed that there exists in nature a distinct and continuous vacuum,\r\nbut that it is distributed in small measures through air and liquid\r\nand all other bodies. Adamant alone might be thought not to partake of\r\nthis quality, as it does not admit of fusion or fracture, and, when\r\nbeaten against anvils or hammers, buries itself in them entire. This\r\npeculiarity however is due to its excessive density: for the particles\r\nof fire, being coarser than the void spaces in the stone, do not pass\r\nthrough them, but only touch the outer surface; consequently, as they\r\ndo not penetrate into this, as into other substances, no heat results.\r\nThe particles of the air are in contact with each other, yet they do\r\nnot fit closely in every part, but void spaces are left between them,\r\nas in the sand on the sea shore: the grains of sand must be imagined\r\nto correspond to the particles of air, and the air between the grains\r\nof sand to the void spaces between the particles of air. Hence, when\r\nany force is applied to it, the air is compressed, and, contrary to\r\nits nature, falls into the vacant spaces from the pressure exerted on\r\nits particles: but when the force is withdrawn, the air returns again\r\nto its former position from the elasticity of its particles, as is the\r\ncase with horn shavings and sponge, which, when compressed and set\r\nfree again, return to the same position and exhibit the same bulk.\r\nSimilarly, if from the application of force the particles of air be\r\ndivided and a vacuum be produced larger than is natural, the particles\r\nunite again afterwards; for bodies will have a rapid motion through a\r\nvacuum, where there is nothing to obstruct or repel them, until they\r\nare in contact. Thus, if a light vessel with a narrow mouth be taken\r\nand applied to the lips, and the air be sucked out and discharged, the\r\nvessel will be suspended from the lips, the vacuum drawing the flesh\r\ntowards it that the exhausted space may be filled. It is manifest from\r\nthis that there was a continuous vacuum in the vessel. The same may be\r\nshown by means of the egg-shaped cups used by physicians, which are of\r\nglass,[5] and have narrow mouths. When they wish to fill these with\r\nliquid, after sucking out the contained air, they place the finger on\r\nthe vessel’s mouth and invert it into the liquid; then, the finger\r\nbeing withdrawn, the water is drawn up into the exhausted space, though\r\nthe upward motion is against its nature. Very similar is the operation\r\nof cupping-glasses, which, when applied to the body, not only do not\r\nfall though of considerable weight, but even draw the contiguous matter\r\ntoward them through the apertures of the body. The explanation is that\r\nthe fire placed in them consumes and rarefies the air they contain,\r\njust as other substances, water, air or earth are consumed and pass\r\nover into more subtle substances.\r\n\r\nThat something is consumed by the action of fire is manifest from\r\ncoal-cinders, which, preserving the same bulk as they had before\r\ncombustion, or nearly so, differ very much in weight. The consumed\r\nparts pass away with the smoke into a substance of fire or air or\r\nearth: the subtlest parts pass into the highest region where fire is;\r\nthe parts somewhat coarser than these into air, and those coarser\r\nstill, having been borne with the others a certain space by the\r\ncurrent, descend again into the lower regions and mingle with earthy\r\nsubstances. Water also, when consumed by the action of fire, is\r\ntransformed into air; for the vapour arising from cauldrons placed\r\nupon flames is nothing but the evaporation from the liquid passing\r\ninto air. That fire, then, dissolves and transforms all bodies grosser\r\nthan itself is evident from the above facts. Again, in the exhalations\r\nthat rise from the earth the grosser kinds of matter are changed into\r\nsubtler substances; for dew is sent up from the evaporation of the\r\nwater contained in the earth by exhalation; and this exhalation is\r\nproduced by some igneous substance, when the sun is under the earth\r\nand warms the ground below, especially if the soil be sulphureous or\r\nbituminous, and the ground thus warmed increases the exhalation. The\r\nwarm springs found in the earth are due to the same cause. The lighter\r\nportions of the dew, then, pass into air; the grosser, after being\r\nborne upwards for a certain space from the force of the exhalation,\r\nwhen this has cooled at the return of the sun, descend again to the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nWinds are produced from excessive exhalation, whereby the air is\r\ndisturbed and rarefied, and sets in motion the air in immediate\r\ncontact with it. This movement of the air, however, is not everywhere\r\nof uniform velocity: it is more violent in the neighbourhood of the\r\nexhalation, where the motion began; fainter at a greater distance from\r\nit: just as heavy bodies, when rising, move more rapidly in the lower\r\nregion where the propelling force is, and more slowly in the higher;\r\nand when the force which originally propelled them no longer acts upon\r\nthem, they return to their natural position, that is, to the surface\r\nof the earth. If the propelling force continued to urge them onward\r\nwith equal velocity, they would never have stopped; but now the force\r\ngradually ceases, being as it were expended, and the speed of the\r\nmotion ceases with it.\r\n\r\nWater, again, is transformed into an earthy substance: if we pour\r\nwater into an earthy and hollow place, after a short time the water\r\ndisappears, being absorbed by the earthy substance, so that it mingles\r\nwith, and is actually transformed into, earth. And if any one says\r\nthat it is not transformed or absorbed by the earth, but is drawn\r\nout by heat, either of the sun or some other body, he shall be shewn\r\nto be mistaken: for if the same water be put into a vessel of glass,\r\nor bronze, or any other solid material, and placed in the sun, for a\r\nconsiderable time it is not diminished except in a very small degree.\r\nWater, therefore, is transformed into an earthy substance: indeed,\r\nslime and mud are transformations of water into earth.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the more subtle substance is transformed into the grosser;\r\nas in the case of the flame of a lamp dying out for want of oil,—we\r\nsee it for a time borne upwards and, as it were, striving to reach its\r\nproper region, that is, the highest of all above the atmosphere, till,\r\noverpowered by the mass of intervening air, it no longer tends to its\r\nkindred place, but, as though mixed and interwoven with the particles\r\nof air, becomes air itself. The same may be observed with air. For, if\r\na small vessel containing air and carefully closed be placed in water\r\nwith the mouth uppermost, and then, the vessel being uncovered, the\r\nwater be allowed to rush in, the air escapes from the vessel; but,\r\nbeing overpowered by the mass of water, it mingles with it again and is\r\ntransformed so as to become water.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the air in the cupping-glasses, being in like manner\r\nconsumed and rarefied by fire, issues through the pores in the sides\r\nof the glass, the space within is exhausted and draws towards it the\r\nmatter adjacent, of whatever kind it may be. But, if the cupping-glass\r\nbe slightly raised, the air will enter the exhausted space and no more\r\nmatter will be drawn up.\r\n\r\nThey, then, who assert that there is absolutely no vacuum may invent\r\nmany arguments on this subject, and perhaps seem to discourse most\r\nplausibly though they offer no tangible proof. If, however, it be\r\nshewn by an appeal to sensible phenomena that there is such a thing\r\nas a continuous vacuum, but artificially produced; that a vacuum\r\nexists also naturally, but scattered in minute portions; and that by\r\ncompression bodies fill up these scattered vacua, those who bring\r\nforward such plausible arguments in this matter will no longer be able\r\nto make good their ground.\r\n\r\nProvide a spherical vessel, of the thickness of metal plate so as not\r\nto be easily crushed, containing about 8 cotylæ (2 quarts). When this\r\nhas been tightly closed on every side, pierce a hole in it, and insert\r\na siphon, or slender tube, of bronze, so as not to touch the part\r\ndiametrically opposite to the point of perforation, that a passage\r\nmay be left for water. The other end of the siphon must project about\r\n3 fingers’ breadth (2 in.) above the globe, and the circumference\r\nof the aperture through which the siphon is inserted must be closed\r\nwith tin applied both to the siphon and to the outer surface of the\r\nglobe, so that when it is desired to breathe through the siphon no\r\nair may possibly escape from the vessel. Let us watch the result. The\r\nglobe, like other vessels commonly said to be empty, contains air,\r\nand as this air fills all the space within it and presses uniformly\r\nagainst the inner surface of the vessel, if there is no vacuum, as\r\nsome suppose, we can neither introduce water nor more air, unless the\r\nair contained before make way for it; and if by the application of\r\nforce we make the attempt, the vessel, being full, will burst sooner\r\nthan admit it. For the particles of air cannot be condensed, as there\r\nmust in that case be interstices between them, by compression into\r\nwhich their bulk may become less; but this is not credible if there\r\nis no vacuum: nor again, as the particles press against one another\r\nthroughout their whole surface and likewise against the sides of the\r\nvessel, can they be pushed away so as to make room if there is no\r\nvacuum. Thus in no way can anything from without be introduced into\r\nthe globe unless some portion of the previously contained air escape;\r\nif, that is to say, the whole space is closely and uniformly filled,\r\nas the objectors suppose. And yet, if any one, inserting the siphon\r\nin his mouth, shall blow into the globe, he will introduce much wind\r\nwithout any of the previously contained air giving way. And, this being\r\nthe uniform result, it is clearly shewn that a condensation takes place\r\nof the particles contained in the globe into the interspersed vacua.\r\nThe condensation however is effected artificially by the forcible\r\nintroduction of air. Now if, after blowing into the vessel, we bring\r\nthe hand close to the mouth, and quickly cover the siphon with the\r\nfinger, the air remains the whole time pent up in the globe; and on\r\nthe removal of the finger the introduced air will rush out again with\r\na loud noise, being thrust out, as we stated, by the expansion of\r\nthe original air which takes place from its elasticity. Again, if we\r\ndraw out the air in the globe by suction through the siphon, it will\r\nfollow abundantly, though no other substance take its place in the\r\nvessel, as has been said in the case of the egg. By this experiment\r\nit is completely proved that an accumulation of vacuum goes on in the\r\nglobe; for the particles of air left behind cannot grow larger in the\r\ninterval so as to occupy the space left by the particles driven out.\r\nFor if they increase in magnitude when no foreign substance can be\r\nadded, it must be supposed that this increase arises from expansion,\r\nwhich is equivalent to a re-arrangement of the particles through the\r\nproduction of a vacuum. But it is maintained that there is no vacuum;\r\nthe particles therefore will not become larger, for it is not possible\r\nto imagine for them any other mode of increase. It is clear, then, from\r\nwhat has been said that certain void spaces are interspersed between\r\nthe particles of the air, into which, when force is applied, they fall\r\ncontrary to their natural action.\r\n\r\nThe air contained in the vessel inverted in water does not undergo\r\nmuch compression, for the compressing force is not considerable,\r\nseeing that water, in its own nature, possesses neither weight nor\r\npower of excessive pressure. Whence it is that, though divers to the\r\nbottom of the sea support an immense weight of water on their backs,\r\nrespiration is not compelled by the water, though the air contained in\r\ntheir nostrils is extremely little. It is worth while here to examine\r\nwhat reason is given why those who dive deep, supporting on their\r\nbacks an immense weight of water, are not crushed. Some say that it\r\nis because water is of uniform weight: but these give no reason why\r\ndivers are not crushed by the water above. The true reason may be shewn\r\nas follows. Let us imagine the column of liquid which is directly over\r\nthe surface of the object under pressure, (in immediate contact with\r\nwhich the water is,) to be a body of the same weight and form as the\r\nsuperincumbent liquid, and that this is so placed in the water that its\r\nunder surface coincides with the surface of the body pressed, resting\r\nupon it in the same manner as the previously superincumbent liquid,\r\nwith which it exactly corresponds. It is clear, then, that this body\r\ndoes not project above the liquid in which it is immersed, and will\r\nnot sink beneath its surface. For Archimedes has shewn, in his work\r\non ‘Floating Bodies,’ that bodies of equal weight with any liquid,\r\nwhen immersed in it, will neither project above nor sink beneath its\r\nsurface: therefore they will not exert pressure on objects beneath.\r\nAgain, such a body, if all objects which exert pressure from above be\r\nremoved, remains in the same place; how then can a body which has no\r\ntendency downward exert pressure? Similarly, the liquid displaced by\r\nthe body will not exert pressure on objects beneath; for, as regards\r\nrest and motion, the body in question does [not] differ from the liquid\r\nwhich occupies the same space.\r\n\r\nAgain, that void spaces exist may be seen from the following\r\nconsiderations: for, if there were not such spaces, neither light,\r\nnor heat, nor any other material force could penetrate through water,\r\nor air, or any body whatever. How could the rays of the sun, for\r\nexample, penetrate through water to the bottom of the vessel? If there\r\nwere no pores in the fluid, and the rays thrust the water aside by\r\nforce, the consequence would be that full vessels would overflow,\r\nwhich however does not take place. Again, if the rays thrust the water\r\naside by force, it would not be found that some were reflected while\r\nothers penetrated below; but now all those rays that impinge upon the\r\nparticles of the water are driven back, as it were, and reflected,\r\nwhile those that come in contact with the void spaces, meeting with\r\nbut few particles, penetrate to the bottom of the vessel. It is clear,\r\ntoo, that void spaces exist in water from this, that, when wine is\r\npoured into water, it is seen to spread itself through every part\r\nof the water, which it would not do if there were no vacua in the\r\nwater. Again, one light traverses another; for, when several lamps are\r\nlighted, all objects are brilliantly illuminated, the rays passing\r\nin every direction through each other. And indeed it is possible to\r\npenetrate through bronze, iron, and all other bodies, as is seen in the\r\ninstance of the marine torpedo.\r\n\r\nThat a continuous vacuum can be artificially produced has been shewn\r\nby the application of a light vessel to the mouth, and by the egg of\r\nphysicians. With regard, then, to the nature of the vacuum, though\r\nother proofs exist, we deem those that have been given, and which are\r\nfounded on sensible phenomena, to be sufficient. It may, therefore,\r\nbe affirmed in this matter that every body is composed of minute\r\nparticles, between which are empty spaces less than the particles of\r\nthe body, (so that we erroneously say that there is no vacuum except\r\nby the application of force, and that every place is full either of\r\nair, or water, or some other substance), and, in proportion as any one\r\nof these particles recedes, some other follows it and fills the vacant\r\nspace: that there is no continuous vacuum except by the application of\r\nsome force: and again, that the absolute vacuum is never found, but is\r\nproduced artificially.\r\n\r\nThese things having been clearly explained, let us treat of the\r\ntheorems resulting from the combination of these principles; for, by\r\nmeans of them, many curious and astonishing kinds of motion may be\r\ndiscovered. After these preliminary considerations we will begin by\r\ntreating of the bent siphon, which is most useful in many ways in\r\nPneumatics.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] “Glass working was practised by the ancient Egyptians at a very\r\nearly period of their national existence. Sir J. G. Wilkinson, in\r\nhis able work on the _Manners and Customs of the ancient Egyptians_,\r\nhas adduced three distinct proofs that the art of Glass working was\r\npractised in Egypt before the Exodus of the children of Israel from\r\nthat land, three thousand five hundred years ago. At Beni Hassan\r\nare two paintings representing Glass blowers at work, and from the\r\nhieroglyphics accompanying them they are shown to have been executed\r\nin the reign of the first Osirtasen at the early date above mentioned.\r\nSuch was the skill of the Egyptians in glass making, that they\r\nsuccessively counterfeited the Amethyst and other precious stones\r\nworn as ornaments for the person. Winckelmann, a high authority, is\r\nof opinion that glass was employed more frequently in ancient than in\r\nmodern times; it was used by the Egyptians even for coffins; (_within\r\nthe year 1847 a process was patented in England for making Coffins of\r\nGlass_) they also employed it not only for drinking vessels but for\r\nMosaic work, the figures of deities, and sacred emblems, in which they\r\nattained excellent workmanship, and surprising brilliancy of colour.\r\n“It is certain that the glass houses of Alexandria were celebrated\r\namong the ancients for the skill and ingenuity of their workmen; and\r\nfrom thence the Romans, who did not acquire a knowledge of the art till\r\na later period, procured all their Glass ware.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Egyptian painting of glassblowers at a fire]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Egyptian painting of glassblowers blowing a large\r\nvessel.]\r\n\r\n“Most of the large cinerary vases in the British Museum, found in\r\nRoman barrows which contained bones and bone-ashes, are, probably, the\r\nproduction of extensive Egyptian or Roman works: they are large, and of\r\nexcellent form and workmanship: but the Glass is somewhat impure, of a\r\ngreenish tint, has numerous globules and striæ, and is not unlike the\r\nmodern common crown or sheet glass in quality.\r\n\r\n“We have incidentally mentioned the discovery of Glass at Pompeii.\r\nGlass vessels have also been found among the ruins of Herculaneum: and\r\nit appears that Glass was used for admitting light to dwellings in\r\nPompeii.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Auldjo, of Noel house, Kensington, who resided several years at\r\nNaples, states, that he has seen glass in the window-frames of some of\r\nthe houses of Pompeii.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Roach Smith has a specimen of ancient flat Glass such as he\r\nbelieves to have been used by the Romans, or their predecessors for\r\nwindows.”—_Curiosities of Glass making by_ APSLEY PELLAT, London, 1849.\r\n\r\nMr. Layard in his interesting work on Nineveh, 1849, London, in Vol. I,\r\npage 342, says: “I took the instrument, and, working cautiously myself,\r\nwas rewarded by the discovery of two small vases, one in alabaster,\r\nthe other in glass (both in the most perfect preservation) of elegant\r\nshape, and admirable workmanship. Each bore the name and title of the\r\nKhorsabad King, written in two different ways, as in the inscriptions\r\nof Khorsabad.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_No. 1. The bent Siphon._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nLet A B C, (fig. 1), be a bent siphon, or tube, of which the leg A B is\r\nplunged into a vessel D E containing water. If the surface of the water\r\nis in F G, the leg of the siphon, A B, will be filled with water as\r\nhigh as the surface, that is, up to H, the portion H B C remaining full\r\nof air. If, then, we draw off the air by suction through the aperture\r\nC, the liquid also will follow from the impossibility, explained above,\r\nof a continuous vacuum. And, if the aperture C be level with the\r\nsurface of the water, the siphon, though full, will not discharge the\r\nwater, but will remain full: so that, although it is contrary to nature\r\nfor water to rise, it has risen so as to fill the tube A B C; and the\r\nwater will remain in equilibrium, like the beams of a balance, the\r\nportion H B being raised on high, and the portion B C suspended. But if\r\nthe outer mouth of the siphon be lower than the surface F G, as at K,\r\nthe water flows out; for the liquid in K B, being heavier, overpowers\r\nand draws toward it the liquid in B H. The discharge, however,\r\ncontinues only until the surface of the water is on a level with the\r\nmouth K, when, for the same reason as before, the efflux ceases. But\r\nif the outer mouth of the tube be lower than K, as at L, the discharge\r\ncontinues until the surface of the water reaches the mouth A. If then\r\nwe wish all the water in the vessel to be drawn out, we must depress\r\nthe siphon so far that the mouth A may reach the bottom of the vessel,\r\nleaving only a passage for the water.\r\n\r\nNow some writers have given the above explanation of the action of the\r\nsiphon, saying that the longer leg, holding more, attracts the shorter.\r\nBut that such an explanation is incorrect, and that he who believes so\r\nwould be greatly mistaken if he were to attempt to raise water from a\r\nlower level, we may prove as follows. Let there be a siphon with its\r\ninner leg longer and narrow, and the outer much less in length but\r\nbroader so as to contain more water than the longer leg. Then, having\r\nfirst filled the siphon with water, plunge the longer leg into a vessel\r\nof water or a well. Now, if we allow the water to flow, the outer leg,\r\ncontaining more than the inner, should draw the water out of the longer\r\nleg, which will at the same time draw up the water in the well; and\r\nthe discharge having begun will exhaust all the water or continue for\r\never, since the liquid without is more than that within. But this is\r\nnot found to be the case; and therefore the alleged cause is not the\r\ntrue one. Let us then examine into the natural cause. The surface of\r\nevery liquid body, when at rest, is spherical and concentric with that\r\nof the earth; and, if the liquid be not at rest, it moves until it\r\nattains such a surface. If then we take two vessels and pour water into\r\neach, and, after filling the siphon and closing its extremities with\r\nthe fingers, insert one leg into one vessel plunging it beneath the\r\nwater, and the other into the other, all the water will be continuous,\r\nfor each of the liquids in the vessels communicates with that in the\r\nsiphon. If, then, the surfaces of the liquids in the vessels were at\r\nthe same level before, they will both remain at rest when the siphon is\r\nplunged in. But if they were not, as soon as the water is continuous\r\nit must inevitably flow into the lower vessel through the channel of\r\ncommunication, until either all the water in both vessels stands at the\r\nsame height, or one of the vessels is emptied. Suppose that the liquids\r\nstand at the same height; they will of course be at rest, so that the\r\nliquid in the siphon will also be at rest. If, then, the siphon be\r\nconceived to be intersected by a plane in the surface of the liquids in\r\nthe vessels, even now the liquid in the siphon will be at rest, and, if\r\nraised without being inclined to either side, it will again be at rest,\r\nand that, whether the siphon is of equal breadth throughout or one leg\r\nis much larger than the other. For the reason why the liquid remained\r\nat rest did not lie in this, but in the fact that the apertures of\r\nthe siphon were at the same level. The question now arises why, when\r\nthe siphon is raised, the water is not borne down by its own weight,\r\nhaving beneath it air which is lighter than itself. The answer is that\r\na continuous void cannot exist; so that, if the water is to descend,\r\nwe must first fill the upper part of the siphon, into which no air\r\ncan possibly force its way. But if we pierce a hole in the upper part\r\nof the siphon, the water will immediately be rent in sunder the air\r\nhaving found a passage. Before the hole is bored, the liquid in the\r\nsiphon, resting on the air beneath, tends to drive it away, but the air\r\nhaving no means of escape does not allow the water to pass out: when\r\nhowever the air has obtained a passage through the hole, being unable\r\nto sustain the pressure of the water, it escapes. It is from the same\r\ncause that, by means of a siphon, we can suck wine upwards, though this\r\nis contrary to the nature of a liquid; for, when we have received into\r\nthe body the air which was in the siphon, we become fuller than before,\r\nand a pressure is exerted on the air contiguous to us, and this in turn\r\npresses on the atmosphere at large, until a void has been produced at\r\nthe surface of the wine, and then the wine undergoing pressure itself\r\nwill pass into the exhausted space of the siphon; for there is no other\r\nplace into which it can escape from the pressure. It is from this cause\r\nthat its unnatural upward movement arises.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two overlaping circles, A, B, C are on the left circle.\r\nF, B, D are on the right, a is a center point, F is on a line from a\r\nto A. There is a line from a to B, the intersection point of the two\r\ncircles.]\r\n\r\nThat the water in the siphon will rest when its surface is spherical\r\nand concentric with that of the earth may be shewn otherwise. It is\r\nrequired to prove that a liquid is stationary when its surface is\r\nspherical and concentric with that of the earth. If possible let it\r\nnot be stationary; it will of course become so after being moved; let\r\nit then have become stationary. Its surface will now be spherical\r\nand concentric with that of the earth, and it will cut the former\r\nsurface; for, when the same liquid has taken two positions, there must\r\nbe a line of intersection common to both. Let both surfaces be cut by\r\na plane passing through the centre of the earth; the intersections\r\nwill be the circumferences of circles concentric with the earth. Let\r\nthese circumferences be A B C and F B D, (fig. 1 a.) Join B G; B G is\r\nequal to each of the lines G F, G A, which is absurd. The liquid will\r\ntherefore be in equilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Concentric or inclosed Siphon._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of siphon called _the concentric_ or _inclosed\r\ndiabetes_, the principle of which is the same as that of the bent\r\nsiphon. As before, let there be a vessel, A B (fig. 2), containing\r\nwater. Through its bottom insert a tube, C D, soldered into the bottom\r\nand projecting below. Let the aperture C of the siphon approach to the\r\nmouth of the vessel A B, and let another tube, E F, inclose the tube\r\nC D, the distance between the tubes being every where equal, and the\r\nmouth of the outer tube being closed by a plate, E G, a little above\r\nthe mouth C. The lower opening of the tube E F must be so far removed\r\nfrom the bottom of the vessel as to leave a passage for the water.\r\nThese arrangements being completed, if we exhaust, by suction through\r\nthe mouth D, the air in the tube C D, we shall draw into it the water\r\nin the vessel A B, so that it will flow out through the projection of\r\nthe siphon until the water is exhausted. For the air contained between\r\nthe liquid and the tube E F, being but little, can pass into the tube\r\nC D, and the water can then be drawn after it. And the water will\r\nnot cease flowing because of the projection of the siphon below:—if,\r\nindeed, the tube E F were removed, the discharge would cease on the\r\nsurface of the water arriving at C, in spite of the projection below;\r\nbut when E F is entirely immersed no air can enter the siphon in place\r\nof that drawn off, since the air which enters the vessel takes the\r\nplace of the water as it passes out:—the discharge then, will not\r\ncease, for the whole of the outer aperture of the tube, where the\r\nwater issues forth, is always lower than the surface of the water in\r\nthe vessel, and, as one level can never be attained, all the water\r\nis drained off, attraction being exerted by the deeper column. If we\r\ndo not choose to draw out the air in the tube C D by suction, water\r\nmay be poured into the vessel A B until, when it has risen above C, a\r\ndischarge begins through C D. In this case, again, all the water in the\r\nvessel will be drawn out. This instrument is called, as we said before,\r\n_the inclosed siphon_, or _the inclosed diabetes_.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from what has been proved above that as long as the\r\nsiphon is stationary the stream through it will be of irregular\r\nvelocity, for the result is the same as in a discharge through a hole\r\npierced in the bottom of a vessel, where the stream is irregular from\r\nthe pressure of a greater weight on the discharge at its commencement,\r\nand, of a less, as the contents of the vessel are reduced. In like\r\nmanner, in proportion as the excess of the outer leg of the siphon is\r\ngreater, the velocity of the stream is greater; for a greater pressure\r\nis exerted on the discharge than when the projection of the outer leg\r\nbelow the surface of the water in the vessel is less. Therefore we\r\nhave said that the discharge through the siphon is always of variable\r\nvelocity. But we must contrive a siphon in which the velocity of the\r\ndischarge shall be uniform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Uniform discharge Siphon._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nLet there be a vessel, A B, (fig. 3.) containing water, on which a\r\nsmall basin, C D, floats, having its mouth covered with the lid C D.\r\nThrough this lid and the bottom of the basin insert one leg of the\r\nsiphon soldering it into the holes with tin. Let the other leg be\r\noutside the vessel A B, having its mouth lower than the surface of\r\nthe water in A B. If we draw the air in the siphon through the outer\r\nextremity, the water will at once follow because of the impossibility\r\nof a continuous vacuum in the siphon; and the siphon, having begun to\r\nflow, flows on until it has exhausted all the water in the vessel:\r\nbut the discharge will be uniform, since the projection of the outer\r\nleg below the surface of the water does not vary; for, as the vessel\r\nbecomes empty, the basin sinks with the siphon. The greater the excess\r\nof the outer leg the greater will be the velocity of the discharge, yet\r\nstill uniform. In the figure, E F G is the siphon described, and the\r\nsurface of the water is in the line H K.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Siphon which is capable of discharging a greater or less quantity\r\nof Liquid with uniformity._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nBy the following arrangement we can produce a discharge at once uniform\r\nand variable; that is, a discharge in which, for a certain time at\r\npleasure, the stream continues uniform from the beginning, and again,\r\nfor any other period, is slower or quicker than before, but still\r\nuniform with itself. As before, let A B (fig. 4.) be a vessel of water,\r\nand C D a basin. Into the lid and bottom of the basin solder a tube L\r\nM wider than the inner leg of the siphon. On the lid place a wooden\r\nframe, C N X D, consisting of two upright pieces and a third lying\r\nacross them on the top. In the inner sides of the upright pieces let\r\ngrooves be cut down their whole length, along which another piece O P\r\nis to move freely. Let R S be a screw, working perpendicularly in the\r\ndirection of the lid C D, and passing through a hole in O P: in O P let\r\na pin be so fixed as to enter the spiral thread of the screw. The screw\r\nmust project above N X, and a handle be fastened to its top by which\r\nto turn it, and by this means O P can be raised or lowered. Let the\r\ninner leg of the siphon be fixed in O P, and pass through the tube L\r\nM, so that its mouth may dip into the water in the vessel. Now if, as\r\nbefore, we draw off the liquid through the outer mouth, the siphon will\r\nflow with a uniform stream until the whole be exhausted. And when it\r\nis wished that a quicker stream should be produced through the siphon,\r\nbut uniform with itself, let the screw be turned so as to lower the\r\nboard O P; for then the excess of the outer leg is increased, and thus\r\nthe stream is still of uniform velocity, but quicker than before. If a\r\nstill greater velocity is desired, turn the screw again, so as to lower\r\nO P still further; and if a less velocity is sought, let O P be raised.\r\nThus a discharge is produced through a siphon in one sense uniform, in\r\nanother variable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _A vessel for withdrawing Air from a Siphon._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nTo avoid the necessity of drawing off the water through the mouth,\r\nwhich is only possible in very small siphons, the following contrivance\r\nmay be used. Take a double tube (fig. 5) one part of which fits into\r\nthe other, and attach the smaller part to the outer leg of the siphon,\r\nso that the discharge may pass through it. Let T N be the smaller tube,\r\nand Q U the greater, which must be previously fitted tightly into a\r\nvessel, W Y, containing somewhat more water than the siphon will hold,\r\nand having an outlet, Z, at the bottom. When it is wished to draw off\r\nthe water in A B, close the outlet of W Y with the finger, then apply\r\nthe larger tube Q U to the smaller, and leave the outlet Z free. As\r\nthe vessel W Y becomes empty the air in the siphon will pass into the\r\nexhausted space, and the liquid in A B will follow so as to fill the\r\nsiphon: then remove the vessel W Y, and let the siphon run.\r\n\r\nTo act properly the siphon must be perpendicular; and this may be\r\nsecured by fixing two straight bars to the lip of the vessel A B, and\r\nplacing the inner leg of the siphon between them so as to touch each\r\nof the bars: then fasten a small bar crosswise on each side of the leg\r\nof the siphon, so as to touch the former bars within. Thus, if the\r\nsmaller bars touch the larger, the siphon will neither lean sideways\r\nnor forwards, but will hang perpendicularly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _A Vessel for retaining or discharging a Liquid at pleasure._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed to construct the necessary instruments, beginning\r\nwith the less important, as from the elements. The following is a\r\ncontrivance of use in pouring out wine. A hollow globe of bronze is\r\nprovided, such as A B (fig. 6) pierced in the lower part with numerous\r\nsmall holes like a sieve. At the top let there be a tube, C D, the\r\nupper extremity of which is open, communicating with and soldered into\r\nthe globe. When it is desired to pour out wine, with one hand grasp the\r\ntube C D near the mouth C, and plunge the globe into the wine until\r\nit is wholly immersed. The wine enters through the holes, and the air\r\nwithin, being driven out, passes through the tube C D: and if, pressing\r\nthe thumb on the aperture C, you lift the globe out of the wine, the\r\nwine contained in the globe will not flow out, as no air can enter to\r\nsupply the vacuum, for the only entrance is through the mouth C, which\r\nis closed by the thumb. When, then, we desire to let the wine flow, we\r\nremove the finger, and the air, rushing in, fills the vacuum produced.\r\nIf we again press the finger on the air-hole C, there will be no\r\ndischarge until we once more remove the finger from the vent. We may,\r\nin like manner, dip the globe into hot or cold water, and then retain\r\nor let out the contents at pleasure, until all the water within is\r\nexhausted. If the extremity C of the tube C D is bent, the action will\r\nbe the same, and it is then easier to stop the orifice with the finger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _A Vessel for discharging Liquids of different temperatures at\r\npleasure._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nBy the same means it is possible to discharge from the same globe\r\nboth hot and cold water in any quantity. The globe A B (fig. 7) is\r\nconstructed as before, but furnished with a perpendicular partition,\r\nC D, dividing it equally. At the top a tube, H F, soldered into the\r\nglobe, communicates with the interior; this tube is also furnished\r\nwith a partition, C G, a continuation of the partition C D, and its\r\nopenings, H, K, must curve over in the directions C and F.\r\nOn each side of the partition C D, at the bottom of the globe towards\r\nD, let holes be made like those in a cook’s ladle. When it is desired\r\nto draw hot water, take the apertures H and K by the two fingers and\r\nplunge the globe into hot water, and then unclose one of the vents,\r\nH, that the air in the hemisphere B C D may be driven out through H:\r\nthe hot water, entering through the holes, will fill the hemisphere\r\nB C D: again stopping the vent H take the globe out of the water,\r\nand its contents will be retained, as the air has no entrance. Then,\r\nin like manner, plunge the globe into cold water, unclosing the vent\r\nK, and, when the hemisphere A C D is filled, close K and draw the\r\nglobe out. The globe is now full of hot and cold water, and when it\r\nis desired to discharge either of these, unclose the proper vent: in\r\nlike manner close it again when the discharge is sufficient; and this\r\nmay be repeated till the contents are exhausted. In the same way it is\r\npossible to draw up into and discharge from the same vessel wine, and\r\ncold or hot water, and anything else whatever, at any time, and in any\r\nquantity, by making the necessary partitions and orifices through which\r\nthe air may enter into each chamber and leave it again. Instead of the\r\ncurved outlets, holes may be made in the upper part of the sides of the\r\ntube in various directions; and these holes are of course to be closed\r\nwhen it is required to shut out the air. That the holes pierced in the\r\nbottom of the vessel may not be seen, both sets may be included in one\r\nchannel, so that both streams may appear to flow from the same source.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _A Vessel for discharging Liquids in varying proportions._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nA jar can be made receiving and discharging a greater quantity of\r\nliquid at one time than at another, and in such a way that, when wine\r\nand water are poured into it, it shall discharge at one time pure\r\nwater, at another time unmixed wine, and, again, a mixture of the two.\r\nIts construction is as follows. Let A B (fig. 8) be a pitcher having a\r\npartition in the middle, C D. In the partition, near the circumference\r\nof the vessel, let small holes be pierced in a curve, as at E. In the\r\nopposite side of the partition let there be a circular aperture, F,\r\nthrough which the tube F G H is to be inserted, being soldered into the\r\npartition, and reaching nearly to the bottom of the vessel at G. Let\r\nthe other mouth of the tube H issue at the side of the pitcher, under\r\nthe handle, and be soldered into the handle which must be hollow, and\r\nhave a hole on its outer surface at K, which may be closed with the\r\nfinger when necessary. If, then, closing the vent, as before, we pour\r\nany liquid into the jar, the liquid poured into the upper chamber will\r\nremain there, not being able to continue its way through the narrow\r\nholes into the lower chamber, as there is no other outlet for the air\r\nthan through the vent K. When, however, we unclose the vent, the liquid\r\nwill descend into the chamber beneath, and then the jar will hold more.\r\nIf, then, we first pour in wine so as to fill the chamber B C D, and\r\nthen, closing the vent, pour water upon it, the two cannot mix, and if\r\nwe invert the jar it will emit pure water. But, when we unclose the\r\nvent, the water continuing to flow, the wine will flow out also, since\r\nair can enter through K to fill up the void left; and afterwards the\r\nwine will flow out unmixed. We may also pour in the water first, and\r\nthen, stopping the vent, pour wine upon it, so as to pour out wine for\r\nsome, wine and water for others, and mere water for those whom we wish\r\nto jest with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. _A Water Jet produced by mechanically compressed Air._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nA hollow globe, or other vessel, may be constructed, into which if\r\nany liquid be poured, it will be forced aloft spontaneously and with\r\nmuch violence, so as to empty the vessel, though such an upward motion\r\nis contrary to nature. The construction is as follows. Let there be\r\na globe, containing about 6 cotylæ (3 pints), the sides of which are\r\nof metal plate, strong enough to sustain the pressure that will be\r\nexerted upon them by the air. Let A B (fig. 9) be the globe, resting\r\non any base C. Through an aperture in the top of the globe insert a\r\ntube, D E, soldered into the globe at the aperture, and projecting\r\na little above it; and reaching to the other extremity, except an\r\ninterval sufficient for the passage of water. At its upper extremity\r\nlet the tube D E branch into two tubes, D G and D F, to which two other\r\npipes, G H K L, F M N X, are fastened transversely, communicating with\r\nD G, D F. Again, into these transverse pipes, and communicating with\r\nthem, let another pipe, P O, be fitted, from which a small pipe, R S,\r\nprojects perpendicularly, communicating with it, and terminating in a\r\nsmall orifice at S. If, then, we take hold of R S and turn round the\r\ntube P O, the connection between the corresponding holes will be shut\r\noff, so that the liquid which is to be forced up will have no outlet.\r\nNow, through another aperture in the globe, let another tube, T U Q,\r\nbe inserted, closed at the lower extremity Q, and having a hole in the\r\nside near the bottom at W. In this hole must be fixed a valve, such as\r\nthe Romans call _assarium_, the construction of which we will explain\r\npresently. Into the tube T U Q insert another tube, Y Z, fitting\r\ntightly. If the tube Y Z be drawn out, and water poured into T U Q, it\r\nwill enter the vessel through the aperture W, (the valve opening into\r\nthe interior of the vessel), and the air will escape through the pipe\r\nO P, which communicates, as we have explained, with the apertures of\r\nthe pipes G H K L and F M N X. When the globe is half full of liquid,\r\nturn the small tube R S so as to break the connection between the\r\ncorresponding apertures: then depress the tube Y Z and drive out the\r\nair and liquid collected in T U Q, which will, on the exertion of some\r\nforce, (as the vessel is full of air and liquid), pass through the\r\nvalve into the hollow of the globe; and this passage is made possible\r\nby the compression of the air into the void spaces dispersed among its\r\nparticles. Draw up the tube Y Z, in order again to fill T U Q with\r\nair, and then, depressing it again, we shall force this air into the\r\nglobe. By repeating this frequently we shall have a large quantity of\r\nair compressed into the globe; for it is clear that the air forced in\r\ndoes not escape again when the rod is drawn up, as the valve, pressed\r\non by the air within, remains closed. If, then, we restore the pipe R\r\nS to its upright position, and re-open the communication between the\r\ncorresponding apertures at L and X, the liquid will now be forced out,\r\nas the condensed air expands to its original bulk and presses on the\r\nliquid beneath; and if the quantity of condensed air be large, it will\r\ndrive out all the liquid, and even the superfluous air will be forced\r\nout at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. _A Valve for a Pump._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe following is the construction of the valve referred to. Take two\r\nrectangular plates of bronze of the thickness of a carpenter’s rule,\r\nand measuring about one finger’s breadth (⁷⁄₁₀ of an inch) on each\r\nside. When these have been accurately fitted to each other, polish\r\ntheir surfaces so that neither air nor liquid may pass between them.\r\nLet A B C D, E F G H, (fig. 10) be the plates, and in the centre of one\r\nof them, A B C D, bore a circular hole about ⅓ of a finger’s breadth (¼\r\nof an inch) in diameter. Then, applying the side C D to E F, let the\r\nplates be attached by means of hinges, so that the polished surfaces\r\nmay come together. When the valve is to be used, fasten the plate A B\r\nC D over the aperture, and any air or liquid forced through will be\r\neffectually confined. For by the pressure exerted the hinges move, and\r\nthe plate E F G H opens readily to admit the air or liquid; which when\r\ninclosed in the air-tight vessel, presses on the plate E F G H, and\r\ncloses the aperture through which the air was forced in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11. _Libations at an Altar produced by Fire._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nTo construct an altar such that, when a fire is raised on it, figures\r\nat the side shall offer libations. Let there be a pedestal, A B C\r\nD, (fig. 11) on which the figures stand, and also an altar, E F\r\nG, perfectly air-tight. The pedestal must also be air-tight, and\r\ncommunicate with the altar at G. Through the pedestal insert the tube H\r\nK L, reaching nearly to the bottom at L, and communicating at H with a\r\nbowl held by one of the figures. Pour liquid into the pedestal through\r\na hole, M, which must afterwards be closed. Now if a fire be lighted\r\non the altar E F G, the air within it, being rarefied, will descend\r\ninto the pedestal, and exert pressure on the liquid it contains, which,\r\nhaving no other way of retreat, will pass through the tube H K L into\r\nthe bowl. Thus the figures will pour a libation, and will not cease so\r\nlong as the fire remains on the altar. When the fire is extinguished,\r\nthe libation ceases; and as often as the fire is kindled the same\r\nwill be repeated. The pipe through which the heat is to pass should\r\nbe broader towards the middle, for it is requisite that the heat, or\r\nrather the vapour from it, passing into a broader space, should expand\r\nand act with greater force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12. _A Vessel from which the contents flow when filled to a certain\r\nheight._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThere are some vessels which emit no stream unless they are filled; but\r\nwhen filled discharge all the liquid they contain. They are made as\r\nfollows: Let A B C D (fig. 12) be a vessel open at the top, and through\r\nits bottom pass a tube, either an inclosed diabetes as E F G, or a bent\r\nsiphon G H K. When the vessel A B C D is filled, and the water runs\r\nover, a discharge will begin through the diabetes, and continue till\r\nthe vessel is empty, if the interior opening of the diabetes is so near\r\nthe bottom of the vessel as only to leave a passage for the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13. _Two Vessels from which the contents flow, by a Liquid being poured\r\ninto one only._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nIf two vessels, both of them having visible outlets, stand upon a\r\npedestal, and one of them be filled with wine, the other remaining\r\nempty, the wine shall not flow out until the empty vessel be filled\r\nwith water; and then a discharge shall begin, of wine from one, and of\r\nwater from the other, until both are empty. Such vessels are called\r\n_harmonious goblets_. Let A B C D (fig. 13) be the pedestal on which\r\nthe vessels, E and F, stand. In each of them place a bent siphon, G H K\r\nin E, and L M N in F, and let the outer extremities of the siphons be\r\nshaped like water-pipes. At the bend the siphons must approach nearly\r\nto the mouths of the vessels. Let another bent tube, X O P R, passing\r\nthrough the pedestal, connect the two vessels, the extremities of\r\nwhich, X and R, must reach as high as the bend of the siphons. Now pour\r\nwine into one vessel, taking care that it does not mount higher than\r\nthe bend of the siphon at H. Up to this point the wine will not flow\r\nout, as there is nothing to originate a discharge through the siphon.\r\nBut if we pour water into the vessel F, until its surface mounts above\r\nthe bend of the siphon at M, then the water will descend and pass\r\nthrough the pipe X O P R into the other vessel. Thus a discharge is\r\noccasioned of the wine also, and both vessels will continue to run the\r\none with wine, the other with water, until both are emptied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14. _A Bird made to whistle by flowing Water._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nVessels may be made such that, when water is poured into them, the note\r\nof the black-cap, or a whistling sound, is produced. The following\r\nis their construction. Let A B C D (fig. 14) be a hollow air-tight\r\npedestal: through the top, A D, let a funnel, E F, be introduced and\r\nsoldered into the surface, its tube approaching so near to the bottom\r\nas only to leave a passage for the water. Let G H K be a small pipe,\r\nsuch as will emit sound, communicating with the pedestal and likewise\r\nsoldered into A D. Its extremity, which is curved, must dip into water\r\ncontained in a small vessel placed near at L. If water be poured in\r\nthrough the funnel E F, the result will be that the air, being driven\r\nout, passes through the pipe G H K, and emits a sound. When the\r\nextremity of the pipe dips into water a bubbling sound is heard, and\r\nthe note of the black-cap is produced: if no water is near, there will\r\nbe a whistling only.\r\n\r\nThese sounds are produced through pipes; but the quality of the sounds\r\nwill vary as the pipes are more or less fine, or longer, or shorter;\r\nand as a larger or smaller portion of the pipe is immersed in the\r\nwater: so that by this means the distinct notes of many birds can be\r\nproduced. The figures of several different birds are arranged near a\r\nfountain, or in a cave, or in any place where there is running water:\r\nnear them sits an owl, which, apparently of her own accord, turns at\r\none time towards the birds, and then again away from them; and when the\r\nowl looks away the birds sing, when she looks at them they are mute:\r\nand this may be repeated frequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15. _Birds made to sing, and be silent alternately by flowing Water._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe construction is after this manner. Let A (fig. 15) be a stream\r\nperpetually running. Underneath place an air-tight vessel, B C D E,\r\nprovided with an inclosed diabetes or bent siphon F G, and having\r\ninserted in it a funnel, H K, between the extremity of the tube of\r\nwhich and the bottom of the vessel a passage is left for the water. Let\r\nthe funnel be provided with several smaller pipes, as described before,\r\nat L. It will be found that, while B C D E is being filled with water,\r\nthe air that is driven out will produce the notes of birds; and as the\r\nwater is being drawn off through the siphon F G after the vessel is\r\nfilled, the birds will be mute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nWe are now to describe the contrivance by which the owl is enabled to\r\nturn herself towards, or away from, the birds, as we have said. Let a\r\nrod N X turned in a lathe rest on any support M: round this rod let a\r\ntube O P be fitted, so as to move freely about it, and having attached\r\nto it the kettle-drum top R S, on which the owl is to be securely\r\nfixed. Round the tube O P let a chain pass, the two extremities of\r\nwhich, T U, Q W, wind off in opposite directions, and are attached, by\r\nmeans of two pullies, the one, T U, to a weight suspended at Y, and\r\nQ W to an empty vessel Z, which lies beneath the siphon or inclosed\r\ndiabetes F G. It will be found that while the vessel B C D E is being\r\nemptied, the liquid being carried into the vessel Z causes the tube O\r\nP to revolve, and the owl with it, so as to face the birds: but when\r\nB C D E is exhausted, the vessel Z becomes empty likewise by means of\r\nan inclosed or bent siphon contained within it; and then the weight Y,\r\nagain preponderating, causes the owl to turn away just at the time when\r\nthe vessel B C D E is being filled again and the notes once more issue\r\nfrom the birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16. _Trumpets sounded by flowing Water._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same manner as that just described the sound of trumpets can be\r\nproduced. Insert into a carefully closed vessel the tube of a funnel\r\nreaching nearly to the bottom and soldered into the surface of the\r\nvessel; and, by its side, a trumpet, provided both with a mouthpiece\r\nand bell, and communicating at its upper extremity with the vessel.\r\nIf water be poured through the funnel, it will be found that the\r\nair contained in the vessel, as it is being driven out through the\r\nmouthpiece, will produce the sound of a trumpet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17. _Sounds produced on the opening of a Temple Door._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe sound of a trumpet may be produced on the opening of the doors\r\nof a temple. The following is the construction. Behind the door let\r\nthere be a vessel, A B C D (fig. 17), containing water. In this invert\r\na narrow-necked vessel, shaped like an extinguisher, F, with which,\r\nat its lower extremity, let a trumpet, H K, communicate, provided\r\nwith bell and mouthpiece. Parallel with the tube of the trumpet, and\r\nattached to it, let the rod L M run, fastened, at the lower end, to\r\nthe vessel F, and having at the other extremity a loop, M: through\r\nthis loop let the beam N X pass, thus supporting the vessel F, at a\r\nsufficient height above the water. The beam N X must turn on the pivot\r\nO, and a chain or cord, attached to the extremity X, be fastened, by\r\nmeans of the pulley, P, to the hinder part of the door. When the door\r\nis opened, the cord will be stretched, and draw upwards the extremity\r\nX of the beam, so that the beam N X no longer supports the loop M; and\r\nwhen the loop changes its position in consequence, the vessel F will\r\ndescend into the water, and give forth the sound of a trumpet by the\r\nexpulsion of the air contained in it through the mouthpiece and bell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18. _Drinking-Horn from which either Wine or Water will flow._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of drinking-horn, such that if wine be first poured\r\ninto it, and then water, sometimes the water flows out unmixed, and\r\nsometimes the wine. The following is the construction. Let A B C\r\n(fig. 18) be a drinking-horn, furnished with two partitions, D E and\r\nF G: through both of these let a tube, H K, pass, soldered into the\r\npartitions, and pierced with a small hole, L, situated a little above\r\nthe partition F G; and under the partition D E let there be a vent, M,\r\nin the side of the vessel. If, when these arrangements are complete,\r\nwe close the passage at C and pour in wine, it will pass through the\r\nvent M; and, if we cover M with the finger, the wine in D E F G will\r\nbe retained. Now, if we pour [water] into the part A B D E, still\r\nclosing the vent M, pure water will flow out; but if, while the water\r\nis still in the upper part of the vessel, we unclose M, a mixture will\r\nbe discharged; and when all the water has passed out, the stream will\r\nbe of pure wine. By frequently unclosing M the discharge may be varied:\r\nbut the better method is first to pour water into the chamber D E G F,\r\nand then, closing the vent, to pour wine upon it. The result will be\r\nthat sometimes pure water flows out, and again, when the siphon is set\r\nfree, a mixture; presently, on stopping the vent, pure wine. And this\r\ncan be done as often as we please.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19. _A Vessel containing a Liquid of uniform height, although a Stream\r\nflows from it._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nIf a goblet be placed upon a pedestal, whatever quantity may be drawn\r\nfrom it, it shall always continue full. The construction is as follows.\r\nLet A B (fig. 19) be a vessel, the mouth of which is closed just at the\r\nneck, by the partition C D. Through C D let a tube, E F, be inserted,\r\nreaching nearly to the bottom; let another tube, G H, be passed through\r\nthe bottom of the vessel, reaching nearly up to the partition C D; and\r\nin the bottom bore a hole, K, to admit the small tube K L. The vessel\r\nA B must stand upon a pedestal, M N O X, through which passes the\r\nprojection of the tube G H, and another tube S T communicating with the\r\npedestal and the goblet P R so that the goblet may be filled, and the\r\npedestal M N O X as high, &c. Now let wine be poured through E F into\r\nA B (the air will pass out through G H), and, if the tube K L be left\r\nopen, it will pass through into the pedestal and the goblet P R: but,\r\nif K L be closed, the vessel A B will be filled. Let, then, the wine\r\nrun into the pedestal M N O X and the goblet P R, so that the goblet may\r\nbe filled, and the pedestal M N O X as high as the mouth of the tube\r\nG H. When this is done, close E, and the wine in A B will no longer\r\n[flow] through K L, for no more air can enter through E to supply the\r\nvacuum created. When, therefore, any wine is taken from the goblet, the\r\norifice E must be unclosed, and, the air having found an entrance, the\r\nwine will flow again into the pedestal and goblet, until it is full.\r\nAnd this may be done as often as we draw off wine from the goblet.\r\nIt will be requisite that a small hole be pierced in the side of the\r\npedestal at U, that an equivalent bulk of air may pass into the vessel\r\nA B through the orifice G and the hole U.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20. _A Vessel which remains full, although Water be drawn from it._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to adapt this contrivance for use, so that from a\r\ngoblet occupying any given position a considerable quantity of water\r\nmay be drawn and yet the goblet remain full, proceed as follows. Let A\r\nB (fig. 20) be a vessel containing as much water as will probably be\r\nrequired, and C D a pipe leading from this into a trough beneath, G H.\r\nNear the pipe fix a lever-beam, E F, and at the extremity E suspend\r\na piece of cork, K, so that it may float in the trough; at the other\r\nextremity F let a chain be fastened furnished with a leaden weight, X.\r\nLet the whole be so arranged that the cork, floating on the water in G\r\nH, closes the mouth of the pipe; yet that, when water has been drawn\r\nfrom the trough, the cork, being heavier than the weight at X, shall\r\nsink and open the pipe, so that the water may flow in again and raise\r\nthe cork. Let L M be the goblet placed in any convenient position, its\r\nlip being on a level with the surface of the water in the trough when\r\nthere is no discharge from the pipe owing to the floating cork: and let\r\nthe tube H N lead from the trough into the bottom of the goblet. Now\r\nif, when the goblet is full, we draw water from it, we shall at the\r\nsame time reduce the water in the trough; and the cork sinking will\r\nunclose the pipe, so that the water, flowing both into the trough and\r\nthe goblet, will again raise the cork, and the discharge will cease.\r\nAnd this will happen as often as we remove water from the goblet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21. _Sacrificial Vessel which flows only when Money is introduced._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nIf into certain sacrificial vessels a coin of five drachms be thrown,\r\nwater shall flow out and surround them. Let A B C D (fig. 21) be a\r\nsacrificial vessel or treasure chest, having an opening in its mouth,\r\nA; and in the chest let there be a vessel, F G H K, containing water,\r\nand a small box, L, from which a pipe, L M, conducts out of the chest.\r\nNear the vessel place a vertical rod, N X, about which turns a lever, O\r\nP, widening at O into the plate R parallel to the bottom of the vessel,\r\nwhile at the extremity P is suspended a lid, S, which fits into the box\r\nL, so that no water can flow through the tube L M: this lid, however,\r\nmust be heavier than the plate R, but lighter than the plate and coin\r\ncombined. When the coin is thrown through the mouth A, it will fall\r\nupon the plate R and, preponderating, it will turn the beam O P, and\r\nraise the lid of the box so that the water will flow: but if the coin\r\nfalls off, the lid will descend and close the box so that the discharge\r\nceases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22. _A Vessel from which a variety of Liquids may be made to flow\r\nthrough one Pipe._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nSeveral kinds of liquid having been poured into a vessel through one\r\nmouth, it is required that through the same pipe they shall flow out\r\nseparately at pleasure. Let A B (fig. 22) be a vessel closed at the\r\nneck by the partition C D; and let there be in it several vertical\r\npartitions, extending to the partition C D and making as many chambers\r\nas we wish to pour in liquids. Suppose, for the present, that these\r\nare two in number, and let the partition be E F. In the partition C D\r\npierce fine holes, as in a sieve, opening into each chamber, and air\r\nholes, G, H, close to the partition, also opening into the chambers:\r\nagain, at the bottom let there be small tubes, K, L, communicating\r\nwith the chambers and opening into the common pipe M. If, having first\r\nclosed the vents G, H, and the pipe M, we pour one of the liquids\r\nthrough the mouth of the vessel, it will enter into neither chamber, as\r\nthe air has no means of escape: but if one of the vents be opened, the\r\nliquid will pass into that chamber to which the vent belongs; and if,\r\nafter closing this vent again, we pour in the other liquid and set free\r\nthe other vent, the liquid will pass into the other chamber. Now let\r\nall the vents and the sieve-like holes be closed, and, on opening the\r\npipe M, no discharge can take place until one of the vents be opened;\r\nwhen, the air having found an entrance, the liquid contained in that\r\nchamber will flow out. If this vent be closed and the other opened, the\r\nsame result will follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23. _A Flow of Wine from one Vessel, produced by Water being poured\r\ninto another._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nIf of two vessels standing on a pedestal one be full of wine and the\r\nother empty, whatever quantity of water be poured into the empty\r\nvessel, as much wine shall flow from the other. The following is the\r\nconstruction. On any pedestal, A B (fig. 23) let there be two vessels,\r\nC D, E F, having their mouths closed by the partitions G H, K L. Let\r\nthe tube M N X O pass through the pedestal and bend upwards into the\r\nvessels, reaching very nearly to the partitions at M and O. In E F\r\nplace a bent siphon, P R S, the bend being near the vessel’s mouth,\r\nand one leg, shaped like a water-pipe, passing outside. Through the\r\npartition G H let a funnel, T U, descend almost to the bottom of the\r\nvessel, its tube being soldered into the partition. Into the vessel E F\r\npour wine through a hole, Q, which must afterwards be carefully closed\r\nagain. Now, if we pour water into the vessel C D through the funnel,\r\nthe contained air will be forced out, and pass through the tube M N X\r\nO into E F, and, in its turn, force out the wine contained in E F: and\r\nthis will happen as often as we pour in the water. It is evident that\r\nthe air forced out has an equal bulk with the water poured in, and that\r\nit will force out as much wine. If no bent siphon be used, but merely a\r\npipe at S, the effect will be the same, unless the force of the water\r\nbe too great for the pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24. _A Pipe from which flows Wine-and-Water in varying proportions._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nLet there be an empty vessel, and another containing wine: whatever\r\nquantity of water we pour into the empty vessel, the same quantity of\r\nwine and water mixed may be drawn off through a pipe in any proportion\r\nwe please; such, for instance, that there may be two parts of water to\r\none of wine. Let A B (fig. 24) be an empty vessel, either a cylinder\r\nor a rectangular parallelopiped: by the side of this, and on the same\r\nbase, place another vessel, C D, perfectly air-tight, and, like A B,\r\neither a cylinder or a rectangular parallelopiped; but the base of A B\r\nmust be twice as great as that of C D, as the water is to be the double\r\nof the wine. Near C D place another air-tight vessel, E F, into which\r\nthe wine is to be poured; and between the vessels C D, E F, let a tube\r\nrun, G H K, perforating and soldered into their coverings. In E F let\r\nthere be a bent siphon, L M N, the inner leg of which must reach almost\r\nto the bottom of the vessel, leaving only a passage for the water, and\r\nthe other, being bent within the vessel, lead into the next vessel, O\r\nX. From this vessel let the tube P R lead through the vessels, or be\r\ncarried under the pedestal on which they stand, that it may readily\r\npass near the bottom of the vessel A B. Let another tube, T S, connect\r\nthe vessels A B, C D, and near the bottom of A B place a small pipe, U,\r\nwhich with P R must be included in a larger pipe, Q W, provided with a\r\ncock by means of which it may be opened or shut at pleasure. When these\r\npreparations have been made, close the pipe Q W, and pour water into\r\nthe vessel A B; a part, viz. one half, will pass into C D, through the\r\ntube S T, and the water which falls into C D will force out a mass of\r\nair equal to itself through G H K into the vessel E F; in like manner\r\nthis air will force an equal quantity of wine into the vessel O X\r\nthrough L M N. Now, if we open the pipe Q W, the water poured into the\r\nvessel A B and the wine carried out of O X through the tube P R will\r\nflow through it together: and thus what was proposed will be done. The\r\nvessels will be empty again when, the mixed liquid having been all\r\ndischarged, the air enters them through the tube P R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25. _A Vessel from which Wine flows in proportion as Water is\r\nwithdrawn._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nLet there be a vessel containing water, and a pipe in it provided with\r\na key or cock, and let a figure float on the surface of the water; then\r\nif water, in any quantity, be drawn off through the pipe, wine shall\r\nflow from the figure in any given ratio to the water drawn off. Let\r\nA B (fig. 25) be the vessel of water, provided with a pipe, C, which\r\nadmits of being closed; and on the surface of the water let a basin,\r\nD, float, in which is a perpendicular tube, E F, carved in the shape of\r\nsome animal. Place near another vessel, G H, containing wine, in which\r\nis a bent siphon, K L M, one leg being within the vessel G H, and the\r\nother without, conducting into the tube E F. Now if we draw the wine\r\nthrough the lower mouth M, it will flow into the tube E F until the\r\nsurface of the wine in the vessel G H and in the tube E F shall be at\r\nthe same level. Let that level be in the line N X O P; and at the point\r\nP fix an open pipe, R. Hitherto there is no discharge of wine, but, if\r\nany quantity of water is drawn off through C, the basin D, and, with\r\nit, the tube E F will sink, and the surface of the wine [in the tube]\r\nwill become lower than the surface N X; so that, the outer leg of the\r\nsiphon being depressed, the wine will again pass on into the tube E F\r\nand run out through the pipe R. This will happen as often as we draw\r\noff water through the pipe C, the wine flowing in a fixed ratio to the\r\nwater drawn off. The base of the vessel A B must bear the required\r\nproportion to the base of G H; and thus what was proposed is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26. _A Vessel from which Wine flows in proportion as Water is poured\r\ninto another._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it is required that the wine shall flow in a certain ratio to the\r\nwater we pour _into_ the vessel, we must proceed as follows. As before\r\nlet A B (fig. 26) be the vessel containing water, and G H that which\r\ncontains wine, but let the tube E F be outside the vessel A B. In A\r\nB let a ball, D, float, from which a cord, passing over a pulley, S,\r\nis attached to the tube E F so as to suspend it; and let all else\r\ncorrespond with what was stated in the last paragraph. The result will\r\nbe that, when water is poured into the vessel A B, the ball D rising\r\nwill lower the tube E F, and the wine will flow again. This may be\r\neffected in a different manner by attaching the cord from the ball D,\r\nacross the pulley S to another pulley, T and across that again to the\r\nsiphon K L. It will be found now that, when the ball rises, the siphon\r\nK L M, being suspended by the cord, is lowered, so that, the outer leg\r\nhaving again become the longer, the wine will flow through the mouth M.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27. _The Fire-Engine._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe siphons used in conflagrations are made as follows. Take two\r\nvessels of bronze, A B C D, E F G H, (fig. 27), having the inner\r\nsurface bored in a lathe to fit a piston, (like the barrels of\r\nwater-organs), K L, M N being the pistons fitted to the boxes. Let\r\nthe cylinders communicate with each other by means of the tube X O\r\nD F, and be provided with valves, P, R, such as have been\r\nexplained above, within the tube X O D F and opening outwards from the\r\ncylinders. In the bases of the cylinders pierce circular apertures,\r\nS, T, covered with polished hemispherical cups, V Q, W Y, through\r\nwhich insert spindles soldered to, or in some way connected with, the\r\nbases of the cylinders, and provided with shoulders at the extremities\r\nthat the cups may not be forced off the spindles. To the centre of\r\nthe pistons fasten the vertical rods S E, S E, and attach to these\r\nthe beam A´ A´, working, at its centre, about the stationary\r\npin D, and about the pins B, C, at the rods S E, S E. Let\r\nthe vertical tube S´ E´ communicate with the tube X O D F, branching\r\ninto two arms at S´, and provided with small pipes through which to\r\nforce up water, such as were explained above in the description of\r\nthe machine for producing a water-jet by means of the compressed air.\r\nNow, if the cylinders, provided with these additions, be plunged into\r\na vessel containing water, I J U Z, and the beam A´ A´ be made to work\r\nat its extremities A´, A´, which move alternately about the pin D, the\r\npistons, as they descend, will drive out the water through the tube\r\nE´ S´ and the revolving mouth M´. For when the piston M N ascends it\r\nopens the aperture T, as the cup W Y rises, and shuts the valve R; but\r\nwhen it descends it shuts T and opens R, through which the water is\r\ndriven and forced upwards. The action of the other piston, K L, is the\r\nsame. Now the small pipe M´, which waves backward and forward, ejects\r\nthe water to the required height but not in the required direction,\r\nunless the whole machine be turned round; which on urgent occasions is\r\na tedious and difficult process. In order, therefore, that the water\r\nmay be ejected to the spot required, let the tube E´ S´ consist of\r\ntwo tubes, fitting closely together lengthwise, of which one must be\r\nattached to the tube X O D F, and the other to the part from which the\r\narms branch off at S´; and thus, if the upper tube be turned round,\r\nby the inclination of the mouthpiece M´ the stream of water can be\r\nforced to any spot we please. The upper joint of the double tube must\r\nbe secured to the lower, to prevent its being forced from the machine\r\nby the violence of the water. This may be effected by holdfasts in the\r\nshape of the letter L, soldered to the upper tube, and sliding on a\r\nring which encircles the lower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28. _An Automaton which drinks at certain times only, on a Liquid being\r\npresented to it._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nIn any place provided with running water make a figure of some animal\r\nin bronze or any other material: when a cup is offered to it, the\r\nanimal shall drink with a loud noise so as to present the appearance of\r\nthirst. The following is the construction. A B (fig. 28) is a vessel\r\ninto which a stream of running water, C, falls. In A B place a bent\r\nsiphon or inclosed diabetes, D E F, one leg of which must project below\r\nthe bottom of the vessel. Underneath this let there be an air-tight\r\npedestal, G H K L, also containing a bent siphon, M N X. Below the\r\norifice F place a funnel, O P, the tube of which must descend into the\r\npedestal leaving a passage for the water between its extremity and the\r\nbottom. Let the mouth of the animal be at R, from which a concealed\r\ntube, R S T, must run along one of the feet, or some other part, into\r\nthe pedestal. When the vessel A B is filled, the water will overflow\r\nand run into the funnel, filling the pedestal G H K L and emptying\r\nthe vessel A B; in like manner, when the pedestal is full, the water\r\nwill overflow through the siphon M N X and empty the pedestal; and, as\r\nthis becomes empty, the air will enter through the mouth R to fill up\r\nthe void that is left. If, then, we apply a drinking vessel at R, the\r\nliquid will be violently attracted and sucked down instead of the air,\r\nuntil the pedestal within has become empty. Then the vessel A B is\r\nagain filled and emptied, and the same will take place as before. In\r\norder that the cup may be applied at the right time, that is, when the\r\nwater is being drawn off from the pedestal, let something be contrived\r\nthat will move when struck by water from the discharge through the\r\nsiphon M N X. When this is seen to move, apply the drinking cup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29. _An Automaton which may be made to drink at any time, on a Liquid\r\nbeing presented to it._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThere is another way in which, by the aid of running water, the animal\r\nmay be made to drink on the revolution of a carved figure of Pan. Let\r\nA B C D (fig. 29) be a pedestal, air-tight on every side, and divided\r\ninto two chambers by a partition. On the surface place the animal, and\r\nlet the tube E F G pass through its mouth. Within the pedestal, in\r\nthe lower chamber, let there be a bent siphon, H K L, the lower leg\r\nprojecting from the bottom: and let a funnel, M N, pass through the\r\nmiddle of the partition, its tube reaching nearly to the bottom. On the\r\npedestal A B C D place another pedestal, O X, on which the figure of\r\nPan, P R, is to stand, having attached to it the rod S which projects\r\nbelow into the pedestal. To S let the tube T U be fastened, at the end\r\nof which is the cup U Q, attached to and communicating with the tube.\r\nLet the tube be of such a length that, when the figure P R turns round,\r\nthe cup U Q will be directly above the funnel M N. On the pedestal, and\r\ncommunicating with it, and directly above the funnel M N, place the\r\ncup W Y. Let the stream Z, (which must be greater than the discharge\r\nthrough the siphon H K L), flow into W Y: the liquid will pass through\r\nM N into the lower part of the pedestal, the contained air passing out\r\nthrough E F G: and now the pedestal will continue full as the influx is\r\ngreater than the discharge. But, when we turn the figure P R round, the\r\ncup U Q will intercept the stream Z, which will pass elsewhere through\r\nthe tube T U, and, as the water no longer flows into the lower chamber\r\nof the pedestal, the siphon H K L will empty it, and the air will enter\r\nthrough E F G. Thus, when the cup is applied, the animal will drink as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30. _An Automaton which will drink any quantity that may be presented\r\nto it._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe animal may be made to drink without the aid of running water,\r\nor of any thing to move the figure of Pan. Let A B C D (fig. 30) be\r\na pedestal, and E the mouth of the animal, through the breast and\r\nhinder foot or tail of which a tube, E F G, is inserted, leading from\r\nthe mouth E to the interior of the pedestal. The pedestal having\r\nbeen first firmly fixed, let a hole, E, so fine as to be scarcely\r\ndiscernible, be bored in the tube E F G which passes through the\r\nanimal, in a line with the extremity G. Now if we fill the siphon E F G\r\nwith water through some pipe above it, the mouth of which is applied to\r\nE, the siphon will continue full since its two orifices lie in the same\r\nlevel. If, therefore, a drinking vessel be brought to the mouth E, and\r\na portion of the mouth immersed in it, it will be found that the leg of\r\nthe siphon towards G has become the longer, so that it will attract the\r\nwater, and the water attracted is carried into the pedestal A B C D. In\r\nthis construction it is not necessary that A B C D should be air-tight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31. _A Wheel in a Temple, which, on being turned, liberates purifying\r\nWater._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the porticoes of Egyptian temples revolving wheels of bronze are\r\nplaced for those who enter to turn round, from an opinion that bronze\r\npurifies. There are also vessels of lustral water, from which the\r\nworshippers may sprinkle themselves. Let it then be required so to\r\nconstruct a wheel that, on turning it round, water shall flow from\r\nit to sprinkle the worshippers as we have described. Behind the\r\nentrance-pillar let a vessel of water, A B C D (fig. 31), be concealed,\r\nhaving a hole, E, perforated in its base. Underneath the base let a\r\nsmall tube, F G H K, be fastened, having also a hole bored opposite the\r\norifice in the base, and within this place another tube, L M, soldered\r\nto the tube F G H K at L, and opposite the orifice having in like\r\nmanner a hole, S: between these two pipes let another pipe, N X O R,\r\nbe closely fitted, with a hole at P opposite to E. Now, if the several\r\nholes are in one line, when water is poured into the vessel A B C D it\r\nwill flow out through the pipe L M; but, if the pipe N X O R is made to\r\nrevolve so as to change the position of the hole P, the discharge will\r\ncease. Attach the wheel to the pipe N X O R, and, if it is repeatedly\r\nmade to revolve, water will flow out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32. _A Vessel containing different Wines, any one of which may be\r\nliberated by placing a certain Weight in a Cup._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf several kinds of wine be poured into a vessel by its mouth, any one\r\nof them at choice may be drawn out through the same pipe: so that,\r\nif several persons have poured in the several wines, each one may\r\nreceive his own according to the proportion poured in by him. Let A\r\nB C D (fig. 32), be an air-tight vessel, the neck of which is closed\r\nby a partition, E F; and let the whole vessel be divided into as many\r\ncompartments as we intend there shall be different kinds of wine.\r\nSuppose, for instance, that G H, K L, are the partitions, making three\r\ncompartments, M, N, and X, into which the wine will be poured. In the\r\npartition E F pierce small holes, one in each compartment, O, P, R; and\r\nfrom these holes let small tubes, P S, O T, R U, communicating with the\r\nvessel, extend up into the neck. Perforate the partition E F, near\r\neach tube, with fine sieve-like holes, through which the liquid will\r\npass into the compartments. When it is desired to pour in each kind of\r\nwine, place the fingers on S, T, and U, and pour in the wine through\r\nthe neck Q; it will not pass into either of the compartments as the air\r\ncontained in them has no outlet. But, if we set free one of the vents\r\nS, T, or U, the air contained in the corresponding compartment will\r\npass out through the passage as the wine falls into the compartment.\r\nThen, placing the finger again on this vent, set another free in like\r\nmanner, and pour in another kind of wine: and so in order with the\r\nrest, as many as there may be both of compartments and kinds of wine.\r\nWe may procure each wine, in its due quantity, through the same pipe in\r\nthe following manner. In the base of the vessel A B C D let there be\r\ntubes leading from each compartment, W Y from M, Z A´ from N, and B´ C´\r\nfrom X: the extremities of these tubes Y, A´ and C´, must communicate\r\nwith another tube Y A´ C´, into which another tube, E´ F´, is tightly\r\nfitted, closed at the interior extremity F´, and having holes pierced\r\nin it opposite to Y, A´, and C´ so that, as the tube E´ F´ revolves,\r\nwhen the holes pierced in it coincide consecutively with the holes Y,\r\nA´, and C´, they may admit the wine contained in each chamber and send\r\nit forth through the outer mouth of the tube E´ F´. To the tube E´ F´\r\nattach an iron rod, G´ H´; to this, at the extremity H´, solder a mass\r\nof lead, K´, and at G´ an iron pin, L´ M´, to the middle of which is\r\nfastened a cup, L, with the concavity upwards: let the interior of this\r\nbe a hollow truncated cone of which M´ is the larger circle and N´ the\r\nless, and through this the pin L´ M´ is to pass. Take several balls\r\nof lead, varying in weight, and equal in number to the compartments\r\nM, N, X; and if we place the least of the balls in the cup M´ N´, it\r\nwill descend by its weight until it touches the hollow surface of the\r\ntruncated cone, causing the tube E´ F´ to revolve until the hole in it\r\ncoincides with Y and admits the wine in the compartment M, which will\r\nflow as long as the ball remains in the cup, unless it be entirely\r\nexhausted: when we remove the ball the weight K´ will turn back and\r\nclose the orifice Y, and the discharge will cease. Again, insert\r\nanother of the balls, and the cup will descend lower and turn the\r\ntube E´ F´ further round until the hole in it reaches the hole A´, and\r\nthen the wine in N will flow: as before when the ball is removed the\r\nweight K´ will run down and close the orifice A´, and the wine will\r\ncease to flow. If another ball still heavier be placed in the cup, the\r\ntube E´ F´ will be turned still further round, so that the wine in the\r\ncompartment X will flow. It is necessary however that the least of the\r\nballs when placed in the cup should preponderate over the weight K´,\r\nor, in other words, be able to cause E´ F´ to revolve; for then the\r\nother balls will preponderate and move E´ F´.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n33. _A self-trimming Lamp._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nTo contrive a self-trimming lamp. Let A B C (fig. 33), be a lamp\r\nthrough the mouth of which is inserted an iron bar, D E, capable of\r\nsliding freely about the point E, and let the wick be wound loosely\r\nabout the bar. Place near a toothed wheel F, moving freely about an\r\naxis, its teeth in contact with the iron bar, that, as the wheel\r\nrevolves, the wick may be pushed on by means of the teeth. Let the\r\nopening for the oil be of considerable width, and when the oil is\r\npoured in let a small basin float upon it, G, to which is attached a\r\nperpendicular toothed bar, H, the teeth of which fit into the teeth of\r\nthe wheel. It will be found that, as the oil is consumed, the basin\r\nsinks and causes the wheel F to revolve by means of the teeth of the\r\nbar, and thus the wick is pushed on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n34. _A Vessel from which Liquid may be made to flow, on any portion of\r\nWater being poured into it._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nIf into a vessel, provided at the bottom with an open spout, liquid is\r\npoured, the spout shall sometimes run from the first, sometimes when\r\nthe vessel is half filled, and sometimes not until the whole is filled:\r\nin fine, when any proposed quantity of liquid has been poured in, the\r\nspout shall run until all is exhausted. Let A B (fig. 34), be the\r\nvessel, the neck of which is closed: insert the tube C D, air-tight,\r\nthrough the partition, and let it reach to the bottom of the vessel\r\nleaving only a passage for the water. Let E F G be a bent siphon,\r\nthe inner leg of which extends nearly to the bottom of the vessel,\r\nwhile the other projects without, being fashioned in the shape of a\r\nwater-spout: the curve of the siphon must be close to the neck of the\r\nvessel. In A B make an air-hole, H, near the partition and leading into\r\nthe body of the vessel. If we intend the spout to run immediately on\r\nthe entrance of the liquid, we must place the finger on the vent H, and\r\nthe spout will run, for as the air in the vessel has no way of retreat,\r\nthe liquid will rush out through the bent siphon. If we do not close H,\r\nthe liquid will pass into the body of the vessel, and the spout cannot\r\nrun until we again close the vent: and then, if we set the vent free,\r\nthe siphon will exhaust all the liquid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n35. _A Vessel which will hold a certain quantity of Liquid when the\r\nsupply is continuous, will only receive a portion of such Liquid if the\r\nsupply is intermittent._\r\n\r\n\r\nA vessel can be made which, as long as you pour in any liquid, admits\r\nit, but, if you once cease pouring, holds no more: the construction is\r\nin this manner. Let A B (fig. 35), be a vessel, the neck of which is\r\nclosed by the partition C D. Through the partition insert the tube E F,\r\nreaching nearly to the bottom, and projecting above the partition so as\r\nalmost to reach the brim of the vessel; and let this tube be encircled\r\nby another G H, the top of which is closed by a lid, at a sufficient\r\ninterval from the partition and the tube E F to admit of the passage\r\nof water: in A B make an air-hole, K, leading into the body of the\r\nvessel. Now, if we pour liquid into the vessel’s neck, it will be found\r\nthat it will pass into the body through the tubes G H and E F, the\r\nair retreating through the vent K. But, if we cease pouring, and the\r\nneck of the vessel becomes empty, the air will break the continuity,\r\nso that any liquid in G H will flow down and fall upon the partition;\r\nfor the breadth about the tube G H should be considerable, that the\r\nwater may fall by its own weight. If more liquid be poured in, the air\r\nconfined in the tubes E F and G H will not allow it to pass through, so\r\nthat it will run over the brim of the vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36. _A Satyr pouring Water from a Wine-skin into a full Washing-Basin,\r\nwithout making the contents overflow._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nConstruct on a pedestal the figure of a satyr holding in his hands a\r\nwine-skin: place near a washing-basin, and into this let some liquid\r\nbe poured until it is full; water shall be made to flow into the basin\r\nwithout running over, until all the water in the skin is exhausted.\r\nThe following is the construction. Let A B (fig. 36), be a perfectly\r\nair-tight pedestal, either cylindrical or octagonal in shape, as may\r\nseem more elegant, and divided into two chambers by the partition C D,\r\nthrough which the tube E F, fitting closely into the partition, extends\r\nupwards nearly to the roof of the pedestal. Through the roof insert\r\nthe tube G H, projecting slightly above the vessel, and lying exactly\r\nunder the basin, while, below, it reaches to the bottom except that\r\nroom must be left for the passage of water: this tube must be soldered\r\ninto the roof of the pedestal and the partition. Another tube, K L M,\r\nmust also be inserted through the roof, reaching not quite so low as\r\nthe partition, soldered into the roof and carrying its stream into the\r\nbasin, which lies above the tube G H and communicates with it. Now let\r\nthe vessel A D be filled with water through an orifice N, which must\r\nbe afterwards closed. If water is poured into the basin, it will pass\r\nthrough the tube G H into the vessel B C; and the air in B C, passing\r\nthrough the tube E F and into the vessel A D, will force the liquid in\r\nA D through K L M into the basin; and this being carried again into B\r\nC will force out the contained air as before, which, again, will force\r\nthe water in the vessel A D into the basin: and this will go on until\r\nthe water in A D is exhausted. The tube K L M must pass through the\r\nmouth of the skin and be particularly fine, that the display may last a\r\nconsiderable time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n37. _Temple Doors opened by Fire on an Altar._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe construction of a small temple such that, on lighting a fire,\r\nthe doors shall open spontaneously, and shut again when the fire is\r\nextinguished. Let the proposed temple stand on a pedestal, A B C D\r\n(fig. 37), on which lies a small altar, E D. Through the altar insert a\r\ntube, F G, of which the mouth F is within the altar, and the mouth G is\r\ncontained in a globe, H, reaching nearly to its centre: the tube must\r\nbe soldered into the globe, in which a bent siphon, K L M, is placed.\r\nLet the hinges of the doors be extended downwards and turn freely on\r\npivots in the base A B C D; and from the hinges let two chains, running\r\ninto one, be attached, by means of a pulley, to a hollow vessel, N X,\r\nwhich is suspended; while other chains, wound upon the hinges in an\r\nopposite direction to the former, and running into one, are attached,\r\nby means of a pulley, to a leaden weight, on the descent of which the\r\ndoors will be shut. Let the outer leg of the siphon K L M lead into the\r\nsuspended vessel; and through a hole, P, which must be carefully closed\r\nafterwards, pour water into the globe enough to fill one half of it. It\r\nwill be found that, when the fire has grown hot, the air in the altar\r\nbecoming heated expands into a larger space; and, passing through the\r\ntube F G into the globe, it will drive out the liquid contained there\r\nthrough the siphon K L M into the suspended vessel, which, descending\r\nwith its weight, will tighten the chains and open the doors. Again,\r\nwhen the fire is extinguished, the rarefied air will escape through the\r\npores in the side of the globe, and the bent siphon, (the extremity of\r\nwhich will be immersed in the water in the suspended vessel) will draw\r\nup the liquid in the vessel in order to fill up the void left by the\r\nparticles removed. When the vessel is lightened the weight suspended\r\nwill preponderate and shut the doors. Some in place of water use\r\nquicksilver, as it is heavier than water and is easily disunited by\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n38. _Other intermediate means of opening Temple Doors by Fire on an\r\nAltar._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThere is another way in which, on lighting a fire, the doors will open.\r\nAs before, let a small temple stand upon a base, A B C D (fig. 38), on\r\nwhich is an altar, E. Let a tube, F G H, pass through the altar and\r\nbe attached to a leathern bag, K, perfectly air-tight: beneath this\r\nlet a small weight, L, hang, from which a chain is attached across a\r\npulley to the chains round the hinges, so that, when the bag is folded\r\ntogether, the weight L preponderates and shuts the doors, and when fire\r\nis placed on the altar they are opened. For, as before, the air in the\r\naltar growing hot, and expanding, will pass through the tube F G H into\r\nthe bag, and raise it up with the weight L; and then the doors will be\r\nopened. The doors will either open of themselves, as the doors of baths\r\nshut spontaneously, or they may have a counterbalancing weight to open\r\nthem. When the sacrifice is extinguished, and the air which has entered\r\nthe bag passes out, the weight, descending with the bag, will tighten\r\nthe chains and close the doors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n39. _Wine flowing from a Vessel may be arrested on the Introduction of\r\nWater, but, when the Supply of Water ceases, the Wine flows again._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nIf there be a vessel containing wine, and provided with three spouts,\r\nwine shall flow through the middle of the three; and, when water is\r\npoured in, the stream of wine shall cease, and water shall flow through\r\nthe other two; again, when the stream of water ceases, wine shall flow\r\nthrough the middle spout: and this shall take place as often as we pour\r\nin water. Let A B (fig. 39), be a vessel, the neck of which is closed\r\nby the partition C D, and having a spout, E, at the bottom. Let two\r\ntubes, F G H, K L M, terminating in spouts, pass through the partition\r\nand project above it; and round the projecting parts place other tubes,\r\nN, X, covered with lids at the top and extending to the partition\r\nexcept a passage for the water. Another tube, P, reaching nearly up to\r\nthe partition, communicates with F G H. Having first closed the spout\r\nE, fill the vessel A B with wine through an orifice, Q, which must\r\nbe carefully closed afterwards. When E is set free it will be found\r\nthat wine flows through it, for air enters from without into the void\r\ncreated, through the orifice H and the tube P. Now, if we pour water\r\nupon the partition C D, it will be carried out through the tubes F G\r\nH, K L M; but, as the air has no means of entering the vessel A B,\r\nthe wine will cease to flow until all the water has escaped, when the\r\nair finds an entrance again and the wine flows. Instead of the tube\r\nP, another tube, R S, may be used, piercing through the partition,\r\nabout which another, T U, must lie, like the tubes N and X, but higher\r\nthan those, so that R S may rise above the lip of the vessel. The same\r\nresult will follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40. _On an Apple being lifted, Hercules shoots a Dragon which then\r\nhisses._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nOn a pedestal is placed a small tree round which a serpent or dragon\r\nis coiled; a figure of Hercules stands near shooting from a bow, and\r\nan apple lies upon the pedestal: if any one raises, with the hand,\r\nthe apple a little from the pedestal, Hercules shall discharge his\r\narrow at the serpent and the serpent hiss. Let A B (fig. 40) be the\r\nproposed pedestal, air-tight and divided by a partition, C D. Fixed in\r\nthe partition is a hollow truncated cone, E F, the lesser circle of\r\nwhich, F, is open and approaches to the bottom of the pedestal, leaving\r\na sufficient interval for the passage of water. To this cone must be\r\ntightly fitted another cone H, attached by means of a chain through a\r\nhole in the surface, to the apple K, which lies on the pedestal. Let\r\nHercules hold a small bow of horn, the string of which is stretched,\r\nand at the proper distance from the hand. In the right hand, and\r\ndirected towards the serpent, let there be a hand in every respect\r\nsimilar to the visible hand, but smaller, and holding the trigger. From\r\nthe extremity of the trigger let a chain, or cord, proceed through\r\nthe pedestal and be attached to a pulley, which is placed above the\r\npartition, and again to the chain which is connected with the cone\r\nand apple. Now we must draw the bow, and placing the trigger beneath\r\nthe hand, close it so that the cord is stretched and draws the apple\r\ntightly downwards: the cord must run inside Hercules and through the\r\nbody and hand. From the partition let a small tube, one of those which\r\nare used to whistle, extend above the pedestal and pass under the tree\r\nor along its trunk. Then fill the vessel A D with water. Let L M be the\r\ntree, N X the bow, S P the string, R S the hand that grasps the bow, T\r\nU the trigger, Q W the cord, W the pulley round which the cord runs,\r\nand Y Z the whistling pipe. Now if some one raise the apple K, he will\r\nat the same time raise the cone H, tighten the cord Q W, and draw back\r\nthe hand, so that the arrow is discharged: and the water in A D, being\r\ncarried into B C, will drive out the air contained in B C through the\r\npipe, and produce the hissing sound. When the apple is replaced, the\r\ncone H fitting again into the other, will stop the stream of water so\r\nthat no sound is produced. We must now re-arrange the arrow and leave\r\nit. If the vessel B C is full, it can be emptied again by means of a\r\nspout with a key: A D must be filled as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n41. _A Vessel from which uniform Quantities only of Liquid can be\r\npoured._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe following is the construction of the vessel called a dicæometer,\r\nwhich, having been filled with liquid, discharges an equal quantity\r\nevery time it is inverted. Let A B (fig. 41), be a vessel the neck\r\nof which is closed by the partition A B: near its bottom let there\r\nbe a small globe, C, holding the measure of water we intend to flow\r\nout. Through the partition insert a small and very fine tube, D E,\r\ncommunicating with the globe. In the lower part of the globe perforate\r\na small hole, F, from which a pipe, F G, extends upwards, running\r\njust beneath, and communicating with, the handle of the vessel which\r\nis hollow. Near the hole just mentioned make another at L towards the\r\nbody of the vessel: the handle also must have a vent at H. Having first\r\nstopped the vent H we must fill the vessel with liquid through a hole\r\nwhich must afterwards be carefully closed, or the vessel may even be\r\nfilled through the tube D E itself, a fine hole, however, being made in\r\nthe body of the vessel through which the air can be driven out; and the\r\nglobe C will be filled with liquid at the same time through the tube D\r\nE. Now, if we invert the vessel and set the vent H free, the liquid in\r\nthe globe C and the tube D E will flow out. If we again close the vent\r\nand restore the vessel to its original position, the globe and tube\r\nwill be filled again, for the air they contain will be driven out by\r\nthe liquid rushing in; and, when the vessel is once more inverted, a\r\nlike quantity of liquid will again flow out, except indeed with some\r\ndifference as to the tube D E, for it will not be always filled, but as\r\nthe vessel grows empty it will be empty itself: this difference however\r\nis extremely small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n42. _A Water Jet actuated by compressed Air from the Lungs._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThere are vessels from which water is forced up by blowing into them.\r\nThrough the neck of the vessel (fig. 42), a tube is inserted, reaching\r\nnearly to the bottom, and soldered in at its mouth. Stop this mouth\r\nwith the finger, and pour in some liquid through a hole: then, having\r\nblown into the vessel through the same hole, close it by means of a\r\nkey, and set free the mouth of the tube; the liquid will be made to\r\nspout up through the orifice by the compressed air which was blown in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n43. _Notes from a Bird produced at intervals by an intermittent Stream\r\nof Water._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe notes of birds are produced at intervals as follows. Take an\r\nair-tight vessel (fig. 43), through which a funnel is inserted, the\r\ntube being far enough from the bottom of the vessel to allow of the\r\npassage of water. Above the funnel is placed a hollow vessel, turning\r\non pivots, and having a weight below, into which water is continually\r\ncarried. So long as the vessel on the pivots is empty it will be found\r\nto remain upright, for a weight is attached to its bottom; but, when\r\nthe vessel is filled the water is overturned into the air-tight vessel,\r\nand the air contained in the vessel being driven out through a small\r\npipe will produce the sound. The vessel is emptied of water by means\r\nof a bent siphon, and, while it is being emptied, the vessel on pivots\r\nis again filled and overturned. It will be requisite that the stream\r\nof water should not fall into the centre of the vessel on pivots, that\r\nwhen filled it may be inverted speedily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n44. _Notes produced from several Birds in succession, by a Stream of\r\nWater._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nSounds are produced at intervals in another way as follows. A vessel is\r\ntaken (fig. 44), provided with several transverse partitions. In the\r\nchambers are placed siphons conducting into the chambers beneath, the\r\nstreams through them being unequal. In the lower compartment is placed\r\nthe pipe which produces the sound, and the stream of water falls into\r\nthe upper compartment. It will be found that when the upper chamber\r\nis filled, the water passes through the siphon placed there into the\r\nchamber below, until it has arrived at the lowest, and the vessel being\r\nair-tight, the air in this chamber is driven out through the pipe and\r\nproduces the sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n45. _A Jet of Steam supporting a Sphere._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nBalls are supported aloft in the following manner. Underneath a\r\ncauldron (fig. 45), containing water and closed at the top, a fire is\r\nlighted. From the covering a tube runs upwards, at the extremity of\r\nwhich, and communicating with it, is a hollow hemisphere. If we put a\r\nlight ball into the hemisphere, it will be found that the steam from\r\nthe cauldron, rising through the tube, lifts the ball so that it is\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n46. _The World represented in the Centre of the Universe._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe construction of a transparent globe containing air and liquid, and\r\nalso of a smaller globe, in the centre, in imitation of the world. Two\r\nhemispheres of glass are made (fig. 46): one of them is covered with a\r\nplate of bronze, in the middle of which is a round hole, To fit this\r\nhole a light ball, of small size, is constructed, and thrown into the\r\nwater contained in the other hemisphere: the covered hemisphere is\r\nnext applied to this, and, a certain quantity of liquid having been\r\nremoved from the water, the intermediate space will contain the ball;\r\nthus by the application of the second hemisphere what was proposed is\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n47. _A Fountain which trickles by the Action of the Sun’s Rays._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe “fountain” as it is called may be made to trickle as long as the\r\nsun falls upon it. Let there be an air-tight pedestal, A B C D (fig.\r\n47), through which a funnel is inserted, its tube extending within a\r\nvery little of the bottom. Let E F be a globe, from which a tube leads\r\ninto the pedestal, (reaching nearly to the bottom of the pedestal and\r\nto the circumference of the globe,) while a bent siphon, fitted into\r\nthe globe, leads into the funnel. Now pour water into the globe; and\r\nwhen the sun falls upon the globe, the air in it, being heated, will\r\ndrive out the liquid, which will be carried along the siphon G, and\r\npass through the funnel into the pedestal. But when the globe is in the\r\nshade, the air having escaped through the globe, the tube will again\r\nsuck up the liquid, and fill the void which had been produced; and this\r\nwill take place as often as the sun falls upon the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n48. _A Thyrsus made to whistle by being submerged in Water._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nBy immersing a thyrsus in water to produce the sound either of a\r\npipe or of any bird. Let A B C D (fig. 48), be a thyrsus; and at the\r\nextremity of its head, which must be hollow and shaped like a fir-cone,\r\nlet there be an orifice D. Close the shaft a little below the mouth by\r\nthe partition A E, and place near it a small pipe, F, just beneath the\r\nmouth of the tube, and passing through an orifice in the partition.\r\nIf we insert the thyrsus in water and force it downwards, the air\r\ncontained in it being driven out by the water will produce a sound.\r\nIf there is nothing but the pipe we shall have a whistle only; but if\r\nthere is any quantity of water under the partition there will be a\r\ngurgling sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n49. _A Trumpet, in the Hands of an Automaton, sounded by compressed\r\nAir._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nA figure stands upon a pedestal having a trumpet in its mouth: if it\r\nbe blown into, the trumpet shall sound. Let A B C D (fig. 49), be an\r\nair-tight pedestal on which a figure stands, and within the pedestal\r\nlet there be a hollow hemisphere, E F G, covered over at the top and\r\nhaving small holes in the bottom. From the hemisphere a tube, H F,\r\nextends upwards into the figure in the direction of the trumpet, which\r\nis provided with a mouthpiece. Pour liquid into the pedestal through a\r\nhole which must be afterwards stopped again by means of [a valve or tap\r\ncalled] a smerisma. Now, if we blow into the bell of the trumpet, the\r\nair passing from us will force out through the holes the water in the\r\nhemisphere, which will mount up into the pedestal: but when we withdraw\r\nthe breath, the water will enter the hemisphere again and force out the\r\nair, which, passing out through the mouthpiece, will produce the sound\r\nof a trumpet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n50. _The Steam-Engine._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nPlace a cauldron over a fire: a ball shall revolve on a pivot. A fire\r\nis lighted under a cauldron, A B, (fig. 50), containing water, and\r\ncovered at the mouth by the lid C D: with this the bent tube E F G\r\ncommunicates, the extremity of the tube being fitted into a hollow\r\nball, H K. Opposite to the extremity G place a pivot, L M, resting on\r\nthe lid C D; and let the ball contain two bent pipes, communicating\r\nwith it at the opposite extremities of a diameter, and bent in opposite\r\ndirections, the bends being at right angles and across the lines F G, L\r\nM. As the cauldron gets hot it will be found that the steam, entering\r\nthe ball through E F G, passes out through the bent tubes towards the\r\nlid, and causes the ball to revolve, as in the case of the dancing\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n51. _A Vessel from which flowing Water may be stopped at pleasure._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nIf a bowl stands upon a pedestal and has an open water-spout, the\r\ndischarge shall suddenly cease, though there be no slide or tap\r\nattached to shut the spout. Let A B (fig. 51), be the bowl on the\r\npedestal C: through the bottom of the bowl and the pedestal insert a\r\ntube, D E F, terminating in a spout; and at the handle of the vessel\r\nfix a bar, G H, against which another bar, K L, may move about the pin\r\nH: at the extremity K place a vertical bar, K M, moving about the pin\r\nK: to this bar let a box, N X, be attached at M, having weight, and\r\nlarge enough to inclose the tube D E F. When the bowl is full, if we\r\ndepress the extremity L of the bar, the box N X will ascend, and, when\r\nthis is raised, the water in the bowl will be carried out through the\r\ntube D E F: but if the extremity L be set free, the box will descend\r\nand encompass the tube D E F, and the air it contains, having no way of\r\nescape, will disconnect the liquid round the tube D E F, and prevent\r\nit from being further carried out through the mouth D. When we again\r\ndepress the extremity L the spout will run as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n52. _A Drinking-Horn in which a peculiarly formed Siphon is fixed._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe construction of a drinking-horn such that, if a cover of glass be\r\nplaced upon it, while a discharge is going on from the vessel, the\r\nliquid shall ascend into the glass cover and be thrown back. A B C\r\n(fig. 52), is a drinking-horn, closed by the covering D E; and from D E\r\nextend two tubes, F G, H K, one of them, H K, leading into the interior\r\nof the vessel, the other, F G, leading outside. A glass cover, M N,\r\nincloses this; and in the top, D E, outside the glass vessel, is an\r\naperture, X, through which water may be poured. When the horn is filled\r\nthrough this aperture, the tube H K will be filled at the same time,\r\nand as the water is poured in it will ascend into the glass vessel so\r\nas to be carried outside through the tube F G. Thus we shall have the\r\narrangement of a bent siphon, of which H K is the smaller leg and F\r\nG the greater, so that it will attract the liquid in the horn as it\r\nascends into the cover; it will also attract the air contained in the\r\ncover, which is lighter than the liquid, and the water will appear to\r\nbe thrown back into the void space left by the air and to descend by\r\nits own weight; for this upward motion is contrary to its nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n53. _A Vessel in which Water and Air ascend and descend alternately._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThere is also another contrivance by which liquid is borne steadily\r\nupwards and remains, so as to seem perpetually ascending. Let A B (fig.\r\n53), be a perfectly air-tight pedestal, furnished with a partition, C\r\nD, and a cylindrical glass cover, E F, also perfectly air-tight. In the\r\ncover E F let there be a tube, G H, reaching nearly to the top, and\r\npassing through an orifice in the partition C D, and another tube, K\r\nL, passing through the top of the pedestal but not descending quite so\r\nlow as the partition. In the pedestal, and outside the glass cover, let\r\nthere be an aperture, M, through which the vessel A D is to be filled,\r\nand near the bottom of the pedestal a spout, N; also one other tube, X\r\nO, passing through the partition and reaching nearly to the bottom of\r\nthe pedestal, through which the vessel C B may be filled. If the spout,\r\nN, be closed the air in C B will pass out through the tubes G H, K L,\r\nand the hole M; and when C B is full we must fill A D through the hole\r\nM, for the air contained in it will pass out through the same hole.\r\nNow, if we set the spout N free, the air in the glass cover will pass\r\nthrough the tube G H into the void space left in C B, and water will\r\nascend from A D through the tube K L into the void space left in the\r\ncover, while into the void of the vessel A D air will enter through\r\nthe aperture M; and this will go on until the glass cover is filled:\r\nbut the spaces A D, C B, E F, must be of equal capacity that the air\r\nand water may take the place of one another. When C B is exhausted and\r\nthe continuity of the air is broken, the water will again descend out\r\nof the glass cover into A D, air passing into the cover through the\r\nspout N and the tube G H. The air in A D will pass out through the\r\naperture M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n54. _Water driven from the Mouth of a Wine-skin in the Hands of a\r\nSatyr, by means of compressed Air._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nIf wind is blown through the mouth of certain figures, they spout\r\nup water through some other place. For example, if a satyr holds a\r\nwine-skin, water shall be spouted up through the skin. A B C D (fig.\r\n54), is an air-tight pedestal on which the figure is placed; through\r\nthe mouth of the figure a tube, E F, is inserted, communicating with\r\nthe pedestal, and having underneath it a small plate, G H, which\r\ncloses the aperture F of the tube, and is supported by pins to which\r\nbuttons are attached, that the plate may not fall off. Another tube,\r\nK L, is passed through the pedestal, of which the extremity, K, must\r\nbe contiguous to the point at which the water-jet is to be, and the\r\nextremity, L, reach to the bottom of the pedestal, leaving only a\r\npassage for the water. At the extremity K there must be a valve or tap\r\nby which the aperture K, which is very small, may be shut. Now if we\r\npour any quantity of water into the pedestal through a hole, which we\r\nmust afterwards stop, and, having closed the aperture K, blow in air\r\nthrough the tube E F, the air blown in will thrust aside the plate and\r\ndescend into the pedestal: and, if this is done several times, the\r\nair in the pedestal will be compressed and close the plate. Let the\r\nvalve or tap be opened, and after a short time the compressed air will\r\ndrive the liquid in the pedestal violently out through the aperture K,\r\nuntil all the liquid is spouted up, and the air is brought back to its\r\nnatural state, that is, in which it is no longer subject to compression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n55. _A Vessel, out of which Water flows as it is poured in, but if the\r\nsupply is withheld, Water will not flow again, until the Vessel is half\r\nfilled; and on the supply being again stopped, it will not then flow\r\nuntil the Vessel is filled._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThere are some vessels which, when water is poured in, flow\r\nimmediately, but, if we discontinue pouring for a short space, do\r\nnot flow again, though water is poured in afresh, till they are half\r\nfull, when they begin to flow once more; and if we discontinue again,\r\ndo not flow any more till they are quite full. Let A B (fig. 55),\r\nbe a vessel containing, concealed in its interior, three siphons, C,\r\nD, E, one leg of each being near the bottom of the vessel,\r\nwhile the other, fashioned into a water-spout, conducts outside the\r\nvessel. At the outer extremities of the siphons, apply vessels, F,\r\nG, H, the bottoms of which are far enough from the orifices of\r\nthe siphons to admit the passage of water between; and let all this be\r\nencompassed by another vessel, as it were a pedestal, K L M N, which is\r\nprovided with a spout at X. Let the bend of the siphon C be close to\r\nthe bottom of the vessel A B; that of D, half way up its height, and\r\nthat of E, near the neck. Now, if we pour water into the vessel A B, it\r\nwill immediately flow through the siphon C since its bend is near the\r\nbottom: but, if we cease pouring, the liquid poured in will be drawn\r\noff through the pipe F, and the vessel F will be found full of water,\r\nwhile the other part of the siphon C will be full of air. Consequently,\r\nwhen liquid is again poured into the vessel, it will not pass through\r\nthe siphon C, owing to the air which is contained in the siphon between\r\nthe water which is being poured in and that in the vessel F. The liquid\r\nwill therefore rise as high as the bend of the siphon D, which is at\r\nthe middle of the vessel, and then it will begin to flow: but, if we\r\nagain cease pouring, the same will happen as has been explained in the\r\ncase of the siphon C. A like result must be imagined with the siphon\r\nE. It will be necessary to pour in the stream gently, that the air\r\nintercepted in the siphon may not be forcibly driven out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n56. _A Cupping-Glass, to which is attached an Air-exhausted\r\nCompartment._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe construction of a cupping-glass which shall attract without the aid\r\nof fire. Let A B C (fig. 56), be a cupping-glass, such as is usually\r\napplied to the body, having a partition across it, D E: through the\r\nbottom of the cupping-glass let two sliding tubes be inserted, F G\r\nbeing the outer tube and H K the inner; and in these, but outside the\r\ncupping-glass, pierce corresponding holes, L and M. Let the inner\r\nextremities of both the tubes be open, but the outer extremity of\r\nH K be closed and provided with a handle. Under the partition D E\r\nplace another pair of sliding tubes, N X, like those just described;\r\nbut the corresponding holes must be within the cupping-glass, and be\r\nprecisely adapted to a hole in the partition. When these perforations\r\nare complete, let the handles of the sliding tubes be turned round, so\r\nthat the holes in the lower tubes may be in a line, while those under\r\nthe partition, not being allowed to coincide, remain closed. Now, the\r\nchamber D C being full of air, by applying the orifice L M to the mouth\r\nwe can suck out a portion of that air; and then, by turning the handle\r\nagain and not removing the tubes from the mouth, we can keep the air\r\nin the vessel C D rarefied; and this must be repeated until we have\r\ndrawn off a large quantity of air. Then, applying the glass to the\r\nflesh in the usual manner, we open the holes in the sliding tubes N X\r\nby means of the handle; and it must follow that some of the air in the\r\nvessel A D E will pass into the place of the air withdrawn from C D,\r\nwhile into the void thus created both the flesh and the matter about\r\nit will be drawn up through the interstices of the flesh which we call\r\ninvisible spaces or pores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n57. _Description of a Syringe._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe instrument called a pyulcus acts on the same principle. A hollow\r\ntube, of some length, is made, A B (fig. 57); into this another tube,\r\nC D, is nicely fitted, to the extremity C of which is fastened a small\r\nplate or piston, and at D is a handle, E F. Cover the orifice A of the\r\ntube A B with a plate in which an extremely fine tube, G H, is fixed,\r\nits bore communicating with A B through the plate. When we desire to\r\ndraw forth any pus we must apply the extreme orifice of the small\r\ntube, H, to the part in which the matter is, and draw the tube C D\r\noutwards by means of the handle. As a vacuum is thus produced in A B\r\nsomething else must enter to fill it, and as there is no other passage\r\nbut through the mouth of the small tube, we shall of necessity draw\r\nup through this any fluid that may be near. Again, when we wish to\r\ninject any liquid, we place it in the tube A B, and, taking hold of E\r\nF, depress the tube C D, and force down the liquid until we think the\r\ninjection is effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n58. _A Vessel from which a Flow of Wine can be stopped, by pouring into\r\nit a small Measure of Water._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nIf there be a vessel full of wine and provided with a running spout,\r\nwhen a cyathus, or small measure, of water is poured upon the neck of\r\nthe vessel, the discharge of wine shall cease, but, if a second measure\r\nof water is poured on, this last shall flow out with the former, or\r\nthe two measures of water shall flow out through two different spouts;\r\nand, after all the water is drawn off, the wine shall flow again from\r\nthe centre spout: moreover, this shall happen as often as any liquid\r\nis poured on and flows out. Let A B (fig. 58), be a vessel with a\r\nspout, C, at the bottom, and closed at the neck by the partition D E\r\nfrom which extends a tube, F G, encircled by another tube which is\r\nsufficiently removed from the partition to allow of the passage of\r\nwater, as in the case of the inclosed diabetes. Through the partition\r\ninsert another tube, H K, projecting to a less height above the\r\npartition than the former tube, and branching off below into two\r\nspouts L and M; and let this tube also be encircled by another tube\r\ndistant a small space from the partition: furthermore let the vessel\r\nhave a vent N just under the partition. Now, if, after closing the\r\nspouts, we pour in the wine, it will pass into the body of the vessel\r\nthrough the tube F G, for the air will escape through the vent N: but\r\nwhen we close the vent and set the spouts free, the liquid intercepted\r\nin the tube H K will flow through L and M, and that contained in the\r\nvessel through C. If, however, while C is still running, we pour a\r\nsmall measure of water upon the partition, the air will no longer be\r\nable to enter through F G, and the discharge through C will cease: but\r\nif a second measure is poured on, the water will rise above the tube\r\nH K, and be carried through into the spouts L and M, the whole being\r\ndrawn up; and then, the tube F G being opened to the air will enable\r\nthe spout C to flow as before. This result will take place as often as\r\nwe pour on the measures of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n59. _A Vessel from which Wine or Water may be made to flow, separately\r\nor mixed._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nFrom a vessel full of pure wine sometimes the wine flows; if water is\r\npoured in, pure water flows out; then again pure wine; and, if it is\r\ndesired, when the water is poured in a mixture shall be discharged.\r\nLet A B (fig. 59), be a vessel, having a partition near the neck,\r\nC D, through which a tube, E F, is inserted, passing out below and\r\nterminating in a spout. In the tube E F, within the vessel and near\r\nthe bottom at G, let there be a fine hole, and a vent under the neck\r\nat H. Now, if we close the spout F, and pour in the wine, it will pass\r\ninto the body of the vessel, the air escaping through the vent H: but\r\nif we stop the vent and set the spout free, nothing will flow out\r\nexcept what is intercepted in the tube E F. If water is then poured in,\r\nit will flow out pure, and, when the vent is set free, a mixture is\r\ndischarged: if nothing more is poured in, pure wine will flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n60. _Libations poured on an Altar, and a Serpent made to hiss, by the\r\nAction of Fire._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nWhen a fire is kindled on an altar, figures placed near shall offer\r\nlibations, and a serpent hiss. Let there be a hollow pedestal, A B\r\n(fig. 60), on which is an altar, C, containing within it a tube, D E,\r\nwhich descends from the hearth of the altar to the pedestal, and then\r\nbranches off into three tubes, E F leading to the mouth of the serpent;\r\nE G H to a wine vessel K L, (the bottom of which must be higher than\r\nthe figure M,) and fastened to the lid of K L cross-bar fashion; while\r\nthe other tube E N X, in like manner, extends into another wine\r\nvessel O P, also terminating in a cross-head. Both these tubes must\r\nbe soldered into the bottoms of the vessels, and in each wine vessel\r\nthere must be a bent siphon, R S, and T U, one extremity of each being\r\nimmersed in the wine, and the other, (from which extend the hand\r\nof the figure which is to pour the libation,) passing, air-tight,\r\nthrough the side of the wine vessel. When the fire is about to be\r\nkindled, pour first a little water into the tubes, that they may not\r\nbe burst by the dry heat, and close up everything that no air may pass\r\nthrough. The hot air, becoming mixed with the water, will ascend along\r\nthe tubes to the cross-heads, and through them it will exert pressure\r\non the wine, and carry it to the bent siphons R S and T U. The wine\r\nflowing through the hands of the figures produces a libation as long as\r\na fire is burning on the altar. The other tube, conveying the hot air\r\nto the mouth of the serpent, will cause the serpent to hiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n61. _Water flowing from a Siphon ceases on surrounding the End of its\r\nlonger Side with Water._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nLet there be an air-tight vessel provided with an open spout, and by\r\nits side a thyrsus under which is a cup full of water: if the cup is\r\nremoved, as long as it is withdrawn, a small stream shall flow from\r\nthe mouth; but when the cup is pushed back, the spout shall run no\r\nlonger. Let A B (fig. 61), be the vessel described, having its neck\r\nclosed by the partition C D; from C D, and fitted air-tight in it, a\r\ntube, E F, extends, about which lies another tube, K L, forming an\r\ninclosed diabetes. With K L another tube, M N, communicates, of which\r\nthe mouth M is open, while the outer leg is placed in a cup, O X, into\r\nwhich water has been poured until it is full; it is clear that so much\r\nof the leg of the siphon as is in the cup will be filled at the same\r\ntime. Into the neck of the vessel A B a little water must be poured,\r\njust enough to close all entrance for the air; and, when A B is full,\r\nthe spout P, though open, will not run, since the air has no means of\r\nentrance, because of the water poured into the neck. But if the cup\r\nis drawn slightly downwards, some portion of the leg of the siphon\r\nwhich is in the cup must be emptied, and into the part emptied the\r\ncontiguous air will be drawn: this air will attract some of the water\r\nwhich was poured into the neck, so that the water shall rise above\r\nthe mouth F; and hence, the air having found an entrance, the spout P\r\nwill run until the cup O X is pushed up again, causing the water to\r\nreturn to its old position and to close the passage for the air so that\r\nthe spout will cease to flow. This will happen as often as the cup is\r\nwithdrawn and applied: it is necessary however that the cup be not\r\nwholly drawn away, that the siphon leg may not be wholly emptied. Let\r\nthe tube M N be fashioned like a thyrsus, R N being its shaft: thus the\r\nspectacle will be properly arranged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n62. _A Vessel which emits a Sound when a Liquor is poured from it._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe construction of a flagon which utters a sound when liquid is forced\r\nfrom it. Take a flagon (fig. 62), such as is about to be described,\r\nthe neck of which is closed by the plate A B, and the mouth by C D;\r\nand through both these partitions, fitting into them air-tight, let\r\na tube, E F, be inserted. G H is the handle of the flagon, and K L a\r\ntube placed in the opposite side of the neck, fitting closely into the\r\npartition A B and far enough distant from C D to allow of the passage\r\nof water: in C D let there be a small pipe M such as will utter sound.\r\nThe flagon may be filled through the tube E F, the air passing out\r\nthrough the tube K L and the pipe M; and if we take the handle of the\r\nflagon and incline it so as to pour out the contents, water will flow\r\nout of the vessel through the tube E F, and into the neck B C through K\r\nL: the air contained in the neck being forced out through M gives forth\r\na sound. There should be another hole in A B through which air may pass\r\nagain when the vessel is righted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n63. _A Water-Clock, made to govern the quantities of Liquid flowing\r\nfrom a Vessel._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nA vessel containing wine, and provided with an open spout, stands upon\r\na pedestal: it is required by shifting a weight to cause the spout to\r\npour forth a given quantity,—sometimes, for instance, a half cotyle (¼\r\npint), sometimes a cotyle (½ pint), and, in short, whatever quantity we\r\nplease. A B (fig. 63), is the vessel into which wine is to be poured:\r\nnear the bottom is a spout, D: the neck is closed by the partition E\r\nF, and through E F is inserted a tube, G H, reaching nearly to the\r\nbottom of the vessel, but so as to allow of the passage of water. K L\r\nM N is the pedestal on which the vessel stands, and O X another tube\r\nreaching within a little of the partition and extending into the\r\npedestal, in which water is placed so as to cover the orifice O, of\r\nthe tube. Fix a rod, P R, one half within, and the other without, the\r\npedestal, moving like the beam of a lever about the point S; and from\r\nthe extremity P of the rod suspend a water-clock, T, having a hole in\r\nthe bottom. The spout D having been first closed, the vessel should be\r\nfilled through the tube G H before water is poured into the pedestal,\r\nthat the air may escape through the tube X O: then pour water into the\r\npedestal, through a hole, until the orifice O is closed, and set the\r\nspout D free. It is evident that the wine will not flow, as there is\r\nno opening through which air can be introduced: but if we depress the\r\nextremity R of the rod, a portion of the water-clock will be raised\r\nfrom the water, and, the vent O being uncovered, the spout D will run\r\nuntil the water suspended in the water-clock has flowed back and closed\r\nthe vent O. If, when the water-clock is filled again, we depress the\r\nextremity R still further, the liquid suspended in the water-clock will\r\ntake a longer time to flow out, and there will be a longer discharge\r\nfrom D: and if the water-clock be entirely raised above the water, the\r\ndischarge will last considerably longer. To avoid the necessity of\r\ndepressing the extremity R of the rod with the hand, take a weight Q,\r\nsliding along the outer portion of the rod, R W, and able, if placed at\r\nR, to lift the whole water-clock; if at a distance from R, some smaller\r\nportion of it. Then, having obtained by trial the quantities which we\r\nwish to flow from D, we must make notches in the rod R W and register\r\nthe quantities; so that, when we wish a given quantity to flow out, we\r\nhave only to bring the weight to the corresponding notch and leave the\r\ndischarge to take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n64. _A Drinking-Horn from which a Mixture of Wine and Water, or pure\r\nWater may be made to flow alternately or together, at pleasure._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe construction of a drinking-horn from which at first a mixture shall\r\nflow; when we please, on pouring in water, water alone, and then again\r\na mixture. Let A B (fig. 64), be a drinking-horn, its neck closed by\r\nthe plate C D, through which is inserted a tube, E F, leading to the\r\norifice F, and having a hole, G, bored in it within the vessel: in the\r\nvessel just under the partition make a vent H. Now, if we close the\r\norifice F and pour in the mixture, it will pass into the body of the\r\nvessel through the hole G; and if we set F free, the mixture will flow\r\nthrough it, the air entering by the vent H. Again, if we close H and\r\npour in pure water, the mixture will no longer flow as the air has no\r\nmeans of entrance, but pure water; and, when H is set free, both will\r\nflow, the water and the mixture, or rather a mixture which is produced\r\nfrom the two united.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n65. _A Vessel from which Wine or Water may be made to flow separately\r\nor mixed._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nIf water is poured into a vessel standing upon a pedestal and provided\r\nwith a spout somewhat above its bottom, at one time pure water flows\r\nout, at another a mixture of wine and water, and then unmixed wine\r\nalone. Let A B (fig. 65), be the vessel, standing upon a pedestal and\r\nprovided with the spout C D, of which the orifice C is above the bottom\r\nof the vessel. Close the neck of the vessel with the partition E F,\r\nand through E F insert the tube G H, projecting slightly above the\r\npartition and extending to the bottom of the vessel except that a space\r\nis left sufficient for the passage of water. In the body of the vessel,\r\nand projecting without it, let there be another tube K L, under which\r\na vessel of unmixed wine, K M, is to be placed: in the partition E F\r\npierce a very fine hole N. If, when these arrangements are complete,\r\nwe pour water into the vessel through the neck, the liquid lying round\r\nthe projection of the tube will remain in the neck; but all above this\r\nwill be carried into the body of the vessel, and when it has reached\r\nthe orifice C of the spout, there will be a discharge of pure water.\r\nWhen a stream has begun to issue from the spout, the unmixed wine in\r\nthe vessel K M will be drawn up at the same time, on the principle of\r\nthe siphon, and a mixture will be discharged; and when the water is\r\nexhausted, the pure wine will flow by itself, except indeed that the\r\nwater about the partition E F will be attracted at the same time. When\r\nthe small quantity of water on E F has all run through N, the air will\r\nenter and break the continuity and there will be no further discharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n66. _Wine discharged into a Cup in any required quantity._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nLet there be a vessel filled with wine and provided with a spout\r\nunder which a drinking cup is placed: wine shall run into the cup in\r\nany required quantity. Let A B (fig. 66), be the vessel containing\r\nwine, and C D the spout, the upper surface of which at the extremity\r\nC is so smooth that, when a valve in the form of a kettle-drum E F is\r\nplaced upon it, water is excluded. On the handle of the vessel fix the\r\nvertical rod G H, on which, as on a fulcrum, another rod K L vibrates:\r\nagain place another rod, M N, under the pedestal, moving about the\r\npoint X, and attach two more rods K O, L P, moving on pivots in such\r\na way that, if the extremity M of the bar be depressed, the valve E\r\nF is raised, and the spout is opened and sends out a stream, but is\r\nclosed again when M is suffered to return. Let the bar M N support the\r\ndrinking cup R, into which we wish to receive the given quantity of\r\nliquid: the cup must be placed beneath the spout. Take a weight, S,\r\ncapable, by means of a ring, of being shifted along the projection M O\r\nof the rod: and when S has been brought towards M, the spout will be\r\nopened and send its stream into the cup, but as the cup grows heavy\r\nthe weight will be raised again and the spout closed. That the wine\r\nmay flow out in the required quantity, place in the cup any measure\r\nof liquid, for instance, a cotyle, and, receiving what falls from the\r\nspout in another vessel, shift the weight along the bar to the first\r\npoint at which the discharge from the spout ceases: make a mark on the\r\nbar at this point and register one cotyle. We must proceed in the same\r\nmanner for a half-cotyle, and two cotylæ, and so on for other measures\r\nas far as we please; and thus we shall have marks for the different\r\nquantities, signifying the points to which the weight must be brought\r\nin order that they may be discharged. Instead of the valve E F, an\r\nair-tight vessel may encircle the spout, so that, as long as the liquid\r\nis kept away by the air within, there will be no discharge through the\r\nspout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n67. _A Goblet into which as much Wine flows as is taken out._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nLet there be a vessel containing wine and provided with a spout,\r\nunderneath which a goblet is placed: whatever quantity of wine is\r\ntaken from the goblet, as much shall flow into it from the spout. Let\r\nA B (fig. 67), be the vessel of wine, and C D the spout, to which are\r\nattached the valve E F, and the rods G H, K L, K O, L M as before; and\r\nbeneath the spout place the cup P. To the rod K O fix a small basin R\r\ncontained in the vessel S T, and let a tube, U Q, connect the vessels S\r\nT and P. When these arrangements are complete, if the vessels S T and\r\nP are empty, the basin R will fall to the bottom of S T, and open the\r\nspout C D. A stream will flow from C D into both the vessels S T and P,\r\nso that the basin will rise and shut the spout again, until we remove\r\nmore liquid from the goblet. This result will happen as often as we\r\nremove liquid from P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n68. _A Shrine over which a Bird may be made to revolve and sing by\r\nWorshippers turning a Wheel._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe construction of a shrine provided with a revolving wheel of bronze,\r\ntermed a purifier, which worshippers are accustomed to turn round as\r\nthey enter. Let it be required that, if the wheel is turned, the note\r\nof the black-cap shall be produced, and the bird, standing on the top\r\nof the shrine, turn round as well; while, if the wheel is turned [in\r\nthe opposite direction], the black-cap neither sings nor revolves.\r\nLet A B C D (fig. 68), be the shrine and E F an axis extending across\r\nit, capable of revolving freely, to which the wheel H K, which is to\r\nbe turned round, is attached. Let two other wheels be attached to\r\nthe axis, in the interior of the shrine, L and M, of which L has a\r\npulley, and M is a wheel with rays. Round the pulley a cord is wound,\r\nfrom the extremity of which is suspended a vessel N, shaped like a\r\nconical oven, and provided with a tube X O, terminating in a small pipe\r\nwhich produces the note of a black-cap: under the conical vessel N\r\nmust be placed a vessel of water. From the top of the shrine let fall\r\na small axis S T capable of revolving freely: at the extremity S let\r\na black-cap be placed, and at T a wheel with rays, the rays of which\r\nare implicated with, or take into, the rays of the wheel M. It will be\r\nfound that, when the wheel H K is made to revolve, the cord is wound\r\nround the pulley and raises the conical vessel N; but, if the wheel is\r\nlet go, N descends by its own weight into the water and produces the\r\nsound by the expulsion of the air. The black-cap turns round at the\r\nsame time owing to the revolution of the wheels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n69. _A Siphon fixed in a Vessel from which the Discharge shall cease at\r\nwill._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThere are certain siphons which, when placed in vessels, flow until\r\nthe vessels are emptied, or the surface of the water has sunk to the\r\nlevel of the outer orifice of the siphon. Let it be required that the\r\ndischarge shall suddenly cease whenever we wish. A B (fig. 69), is\r\na vessel containing a siphon, C D E, the inner leg of which is bent\r\nupwards as at C F G. Let a vertical rod H K be fixed, on which another,\r\nL M, works as a lever-beam: from L M extends another rod, M N, moving\r\non a pivot, and provided at the extremity N with a vessel large enough\r\nto encircle the bent portion of the siphon F G. On the rod L M suspend\r\na weight at L, so that the encircling vessel is raised above the upward\r\nbend of the siphon, and the siphon flows. When we wish the discharge to\r\ncease, we have only to remove the weight at L, and the vessel at N will\r\ndescend and encircle the bend G C, so that the siphon will cease to\r\nflow. If it is desired that the stream should continue, we must again\r\nsuspend the weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n70. _Figures made to dance by Fire on an Altar._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nWhen a fire is kindled on an altar, figures shall be seen to dance: for\r\nthe altars must be transparent, either of glass or horn. Through the\r\nhearth of the altar (fig. 70), a tube is let down turning on a pivot\r\ntowards the base of the altar, and, above, on a small pipe which is\r\nattached to the hearth. Communicating with, and attached to, this tube\r\nare smaller tubes lying at right angles to each other, and bent at the\r\nextremities in opposite directions. A wheel or platform on which the\r\ndancing figures stand, is also fastened to the tube. When the sacrifice\r\nis kindled, the air, growing hot, will pass through the pipe into the\r\ntube, and be forced out of this into the smaller tubes; when, meeting\r\nwith resistance from the sides of the altar, it will cause the tube and\r\nthe dancing figures to revolve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n71. _A Lamp in which the Oil can be raised by Water contained within\r\nits Stand._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe construction of a lamp-stand, such that, if a lamp is placed upon\r\nit, whenever the oil fails, a supply shall be poured into it from the\r\nhandle to the amount required, though no vessel is placed upon the lamp\r\nfrom which the oil can flow into it. Let the lamp-stand be constructed\r\nwith a triangular pedestal, like a pyramid, A B C D (fig. 71), hollow\r\nand provided with a partition E F. Let G H, which must also be hollow,\r\nbe the shaft of the lamp-stand, and above this shaft place a hollow\r\ncup, K L, capable of containing a considerable quantity of oil. From\r\nthe partition E F, and fitting closely into it, a tube, M N, must\r\nextend upwards, leaving a passage for the air between its extremity\r\nand the covering of the cup, K L, on which the lamp is placed. Through\r\nthe plate K L insert another small tube X Q, a passage being left for\r\nwater between it and the bottom of the cup: the tube X Q must project a\r\nlittle above the plate K L, and into the projecting part another pipe P\r\nis tightly fitted, closed at its upper extremity, and passing through\r\nthe bottom of the lamp so as to be included within it, that there may\r\nbe no projection outside. To P solder another pipe, extremely fine,\r\ncommunicating with it, and reaching to the extremity of the handle, so\r\nthat its stream will be carried into the body of the lamp; this pipe\r\nmust have an orifice like the others. Under the partition E F let a\r\ntap be soldered leading into the chamber C D E F, so that, when it is\r\nopened, the water in the chamber A B E F will pass into C D E F. In the\r\nplate A B let a fine hole be perforated through which A B E F may be\r\nfilled with water; the [air] contained in it will pass out through the\r\nsame hole. We now remove the lamp and fill the cup with oil through the\r\npipe X Q, the air escaping through M N, and again through an open cock\r\nin the bottom C D, when any water in C D E F has first flowed out. The\r\nlamp having been placed on the top by means of the sliding tube P, when\r\nit is required to pour in oil, we must open the tap in the plate E F,\r\nand the water in the chamber A B E F passing into C D E F, the air in\r\nC D E F will reach the cup through the tube M N, and force out the oil\r\ncontained in it: the oil will pass into the lamp through the tube X Q\r\nand the pipe attached to it. When we wish the oil to stop running, we\r\nmust shut the cock and the discharge will cease. This process can be\r\nrepeated whenever it is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n72. _A Lamp in which the Oil is raised by blowing Air into it._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe same effect can be produced with the same general construction,\r\nmore readily [than] by constructing the pedestal in which the water is.\r\nLet the rest be as before, with the exception of the pedestal and the\r\nwater in it; the extremity M of the tube M N, (fig. 72), being fitted\r\nair-tight into an orifice in the surface of the shaft, so as to be\r\nvisible outside. Then apply the mouth and blow into the outer orifice;\r\nthe breath will pass into the cup and force out the oil through the\r\ntube X O. Thus the same will take place as before; for as often as we\r\nblow into the tube oil will flow into the lamp. It will be necessary\r\nthat the extremity of the handle should be bent at right angles to the\r\norifice of the lamp, that the oil may not be driven outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n73. _A Lamp in which the Oil is raised by Water, as required._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe construction of a lamp. * * * * * * * * Underneath the lamp place\r\na vessel perfectly air-tight, A B (fig. 73), either attached to the\r\nlamp or distinct from it. From this let two tubes extend, C D, E F,\r\ncommunicating with the vessel; the extremity C must reach to the bottom\r\nexcept a space sufficient for the passage of water, and the tube C D to\r\nthe surface of the lamp, having at the extremity D a small cup through\r\nwhich the water is to be poured in: the tube E F must pass, air-tight,\r\nthrough the bottom of the lamp. Now if oil be poured through the\r\nopening, it will first pass into the vessel A B, and then, when A B is\r\nfull, the tubes C D, E F, and the lamp will be filled also. As the lamp\r\nburns it will become empty, and if we pour in water through the cup,\r\nit will pass into the vessel A B, and the oil will ascend and fill up\r\nthe deficiency in the lamp, until it reaches the lamp-nozzle. When the\r\noil has sunk again, we must do the same, repeating it till the supply\r\nis expended. If it is required to remove the vessel A B, the oil being\r\nretained in the lamp, there must be a valve or tap in the pipes C D, E\r\nF, close to the vessel A B, with keys near the lamp, so that when the\r\nkeys are turned, the oil in the lamp, and that in the tubes, shall be\r\nconfined. Thus the vessel may be removed from the lamp, and, whenever\r\nit is desired, we may bring them together again, and open the keys. It\r\nis better that the pipe E F should lead to the handle of the lamp, and\r\nC D a little behind it, having the cup which communicates with it, and\r\nthrough which water will be poured in, placed above; so that the oil\r\nwill flow from the handle at the same time that the water is poured\r\ninto the cup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n74. _A Steam-Boiler from which a hot-Air blast, or hot-Air mixed with\r\nSteam is blown into the Fire, and from which hot water flows on the\r\nintroduction of cold._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe construction of a boiler, on which if a figure is placed, shaped as\r\nif in the act of blowing, the figure shall blow on the coals and thus\r\nthe boiler be heated: moreover, if an open spout project near the mouth\r\nof the boiler, nothing shall flow from it until we have first poured\r\ncold water into a cup; and the cold water shall not mix with the hot\r\nuntil it passes to the bottom of the vessel, while water extremely hot\r\nflows from the spout. The shape of the boiler having been determined\r\nat pleasure, in that part of it intended to hold the water a small\r\nchamber, perfectly air-tight, is intercepted between two perpendicular\r\npartitions. With this chamber a tube, one of those which pass under\r\nthe coals, communicates near the bottom, one end of the tube being\r\nclosed that no water may enter it from the boiler: the other tubes lead\r\ninto the chamber where the water is. Thus when the coals are ignited\r\nthey will generate vapour through that tube which leads into the small\r\nchamber. This vapour is carried along a tube which pierces the surface\r\nof the boiler, and through the mouth of the figure on to the coals,\r\n(for the figure must be bent so as to blow downwards;) and as vapour\r\nis always being generated, the figure is always blowing. The vapour is\r\ngenerated from the fire, and, if we pour a very small quantity of water\r\ninto the small chamber, we shall produce more vapour, and the figure,\r\nblowing with great violence, will heat the boiler still higher: just as\r\nin the case of cauldrons exposed to fire we see smoke ascending from\r\nthe water. The figure should be moveable by means of a double sliding\r\ntube, to allow of our pouring in the small quantity of water: and,\r\nat the same time, by means of this tube, whenever we do not require\r\nthe figure to blow on the coals, we can turn it round in the opposite\r\ndirection. On the surface place a small cup from which a tube leads to\r\nthe bottom of the boiler, that when cold water is poured in, it may\r\npass through to the bottom. In order that the boiler may admit of being\r\nfilled when water is poured in, and, at the same time, that the water\r\nmay not boil over and run out, let another pipe communicate with the\r\ncup on its inner surface, to avoid offending the sight. We will now\r\nexpose to view the construction of the boiler. Set up a hollow cylinder\r\n(fig. 74), of which A B is the under surface, and C D the upper; and\r\nconstruct another hollow cylinder, with the same axis as the former, of\r\nwhich E F is the under surface, and G H the upper. On the outer edges\r\nof the cylinders let plates be fastened, so as to keep the cylinders\r\ntogether and cover the edges. In the cylinder E F G H place the tubes,\r\nO K, L X, M N, of which L X perforates the cylinder on one side only at\r\nX, while the other two are bored quite through at each end, and their\r\norifices either way open into the space between the cylinders. Into the\r\nspace intercepted between the two cylinders let down the partitions E\r\nG, H F, intercepting the chamber G H E F, into which the tube described\r\nabove, perforated at one side only, penetrates. Place on the surface,\r\nthat is on G H, a small tube having the figure attached to, and\r\ncommunicating with, it; the figure must be perforated throughout, and\r\nincline downwards so as to look towards the coals. That the figure may\r\ncease blowing whenever we like, let the tube on which it sits be fitted\r\ntightly into the other, so that, when we turn it round in the opposite\r\ndirection, the figure will no longer blow on the coals but away from\r\nthe boiler. We shall also find this sliding tube useful for pouring\r\nwater into the chamber G F E H, for, after raising the figure from the\r\ntube on which it is placed, we can pour the water through, and thus\r\nmore vapour will be passed along into the figure. On the surface H C\r\nlet a cup, R S, be placed; communicating with the interior, and having\r\na tube at its extremity reaching down to the bottom of the boiler with\r\nthe exception of a passage for water. When we desire to let the hot\r\nwater out, we must pour in cold through R S; this will pass through\r\nthe tube which communicates with the cup into the chamber of the warm\r\nwater, which will ascend and flow out through the spout near the neck,\r\nfor the cold water which has been introduced will not yet have mingled\r\nwith the warm below. As often as this is repeated we shall obtain\r\nwarm water for the cold we throw in. In order that we may know when\r\nthe boiler will bubble up, the _chasmatium_ is contrived, perforated\r\nthroughout, and placed on the neck, a hole having been made in the\r\nsurface: it is furnished with a small tube which looks towards the cup\r\nR S, that, when the warm water ascends, it may be carried into the cup.\r\nSuch is the construction of the boiler. If we prefer not to cut off the\r\nchamber F G E H through the whole length, but only for a portion of\r\nit, the partitions are made to reach half-way, and another is placed\r\nupon them, admitting through it a tube which extends up to the figure.\r\nWhen the fire is kindled there will be a rush of vapour from the small\r\nchamber, into which water will be poured as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n75. _A Steam-Boiler from which either a hot Blast may be driven into\r\nthe Fire, a Blackbird made to sing, or a Triton to blow a Horn._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nAnother construction of the same kind is employed to produce the sound\r\nof a trumpet and the note of a blackbird. A boiler is made (fig. 75),\r\nof the same kind as the last, of which all the tubes in the base\r\nare bored through at each end, and near the surface there is a tube\r\nQ E, into which another tube K L is closely fitted, extending into\r\nthe chamber for warm air, and moveable about the pin K L. This tube\r\nis perforated by three holes, M, N, X, and similarly three\r\nholes are bored in Q E opposite the holes M, N, X. Near\r\nX, an aperture is made in a support which receives a tube fitting\r\nclosely into X and surmounted by the figure, as was described in the\r\nlast paragraph: and from M and N two tubes extend, M O, N P, bent at\r\ntheir upper extremities; these tubes pierce through the surface of the\r\nboiler, into which they are carefully soldered. Through the apertures\r\nother tubes pass, fitting tightly into the tubes P and O. On one of\r\nthese tubes is placed the figure of a sparrow, hollow within so as to\r\nreceive water: the tube on which the bird sits is bent, and provided\r\nwith a tuning-pipe, such as are made to produce notes, and the curved\r\npart of it passes as far as the water contained in the sparrow, so\r\nthat, when the sound of the pipe reaches the water, the note of a\r\nblackbird is produced. In like manner the tube N P has another tube\r\nfitting closely into it, on which is placed a figure shaped like a\r\ntriton with a trumpet in its mouth: the tube on which the triton is\r\nplaced is moreover furnished with the mouthpiece and bell as usual,\r\nand when the vapour reaches these and enters them it will give out the\r\nsound of a trumpet. We must discover by trial when the holes in K L are\r\nopposite the tubes M O and N P, and when to X on which the figure is\r\nplaced. Having learnt this, we must make corresponding marks on the pin\r\nK L, that the trumpet may sound, or the figure blow, or the blackbird’s\r\nnote be produced, at our pleasure. The arrangements about the cup and\r\nthe ascent of the warm water are to be made according to the previous\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n76. _An Altar Organ blown by manual Labour._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe construction of a hydraulic organ. Let A B C D (fig. 76), be\r\na small altar of bronze containing water. In the water invert a\r\nhollow hemisphere, called a _pnigeus_, E F G H, which will allow of\r\nthe passage of the water at the bottom. From the top of this and\r\ncommunicating with it let two tubes ascend above the altar; one of\r\nthem, G K L M, bent without the altar and communicating with a box, N\r\nX O P, inverted, and having its inner surface made perfectly level to\r\nfit a piston. Into this box let the piston R S be accurately fitted,\r\nthat no air may enter by its side; and to the piston attach a rod, T U,\r\nof great strength. Again, attach to the piston rod another rod, U Q,\r\nmoving about a pin at U, and also working like the beam of a lever on\r\nthe upright rod W Y, which must be well secured. On the inverted bottom\r\nof the box N X O P let another smaller box, Z, rest, communicating with\r\nN X O P and closed by a lid above: in the lid is a hole through which\r\nthe air will enter the box. Place a thin plate under the hole in the\r\nlid to close it, upheld by means of four pins passing through holes in\r\nthe plate, and furnished with heads so that the plate cannot fall off:\r\nsuch a plate is called a valve. Again, let another tube, F I, ascend\r\nfrom F G, communicating with a transverse tube, A´ B´, on which rest\r\nthe pipes A, A, A, communicating with the tube, and having at\r\nthe lower extremities small boxes, like those used for money; these\r\nboxes communicate with the pipes, and their orifices B, B,\r\nB, must be open. Across these orifices let perforated lids slide, so\r\nthat, when the lids are pushed home, the holes in them coincide with\r\nthe holes in the pipes, but, when the lids are drawn outwards, the\r\nconnexion is broken and the pipes are closed. Now, if the transverse\r\nbeam U Q be depressed at Q, the piston R S will rise and force out the\r\nair in the box N X O P; the air will close the aperture in the small\r\nbox Z by means of the valve described above, and pass along the tube\r\nM L K G into the hemisphere: again it will pass out of the hemisphere\r\nalong the tube F I into the transverse tube A´ B´, and out of the\r\ntransverse tube into the pipes, if the apertures in the pipes and in\r\nthe lids coincide, that is, if the lids, either all, or some of them,\r\nhave been pushed home.\r\n\r\nIn order that, when we wish any of the pipes to sound, the\r\ncorresponding holes may be opened, and closed again when we wish the\r\nsound to cease, we may employ the following contrivance. Imagine one\r\nof the boxes at the extremities of the pipes, C D, to be isolated, D\r\nbeing its orifice, E the communicating pipe, R S the lid fitted to it,\r\nand G the hole in the lid not coinciding with the pipe E. Take three\r\njointed bars F H, H M, M M^2, of which the bar F H is attached to the\r\nlid S F, while the whole moves about a pin at M^3. Now, if we depress,\r\nwith the hand, the extremity M^2 towards D the orifice of the box, we\r\nshall push the lid inwards, and, when it is in, the aperture in it will\r\ncoincide with that in the tube. That, when we withdraw the hand, the\r\nlid may be spontaneously drawn out and close the communication, the\r\nfollowing means may be employed. Underneath the boxes let a rod, M^4\r\nM^5, run, equal and parallel to the tube A´ B´, and fix to this slips\r\nof horn, elastic and curved, of which M^6, lying opposite C D, is one.\r\nA string, fastened to the extremity of the slip of horn, is carried\r\nround the extremity H, so that, when the lid is pushed out, the string\r\nis tightened; if, therefore, we depress the extremity M^2 and drive\r\nthe lid inwards, the string will forcibly pull the piece of horn and\r\nstraighten it, but, when the hand is withdrawn, the horn will return\r\nagain to its original position and draw away the lid from the orifice,\r\nso as to destroy the correspondence between the holes. This contrivance\r\nhaving been applied to the box of each pipe, when we require any of the\r\npipes to sound we must depress the corresponding key with the fingers;\r\nand when we require any of the sounds to cease, remove the fingers,\r\nwhereupon the lids will be drawn out and the pipes will cease to sound.\r\n\r\nThe water is poured into the altar that the superabundant air, (I\r\nmean, of course, that which is thrust out of the box and forces the\r\nwater upwards,) may be confined in the hemisphere, so that the pipes\r\nwhich are free to sound may always have a supply. The piston R S, when\r\nraised, drives the air out of the box into the hemisphere, as has been\r\nexplained; and when depressed, opens the valve in the small box Z. By\r\nthis means the box is filled with air from without, which the piston,\r\nwhen forced up again, will again drive into the hemisphere. It would\r\nbe better that the rod T U should move about a pivot at T also, by\r\nmeans of a single [loop,] R, which may be fitted into the bottom of the\r\npiston, and through which the pivot must pass, that the piston may not\r\nbe drawn aside, but rise and fall vertically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n77. _An Altar Organ blown by the agency of a Wind-mill._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nThe construction of an organ from which, when the wind blows, the\r\nsound of a flute shall be produced. Let A, A, A, (fig. 77),\r\nbe the pipes, B C the transverse tube communicating with them, D E the\r\nvertical tube, and E F another transverse tube leading from D E into\r\na box G H, the inner surface of which is made level to fit a piston.\r\nInto this box fit the piston K L, which is capable of descending into\r\nit freely. To the piston attach a rod, M N, and to this another, N X,\r\nworking on the rod P R. At N let there be a pin moving readily, and\r\nto the extremity X fasten a small plate, X O, near which a rod, S, is\r\nto be placed, moving on iron pivots placed in a frame which admits of\r\nbeing shifted. To the rod S attach two small wheels, U and Q, of which\r\nU is furnished with pegs placed close to the plate X O, and Q with\r\nbroad arms like the sails of a wind-mill. When all of these arms, urged\r\nby the wind, drive round the wheel Q, the rod S will be driven round,\r\nso that the wheel U and the pegs attached to it will strike the plate X\r\nO at intervals and raise the piston; when the peg recedes, the piston,\r\ndescending, will force out the air in the box G H into the tubes and\r\npipes, and produce the sound. We may always move the frame which\r\ncontains the rod S towards the prevailing wind, that the revolution may\r\nbe more rapid and uniform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n78. _An Automaton, the head of which continues attached to the body,\r\nafter a knife has entered the neck at one side, passed completely\r\nthrough it, and out at the other; the animal will drink immediately\r\nafter the operation._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of apparatus as described in text]\r\n\r\nAn animal shall be made to drink while it is being severed in two. In\r\nthe mouth of the animal (fig. 78), let there be a tube, A B, and in the\r\nneck another, C D, passing along through one of the outer feet. Between\r\nthese tubes let a male cylinder, E F, pass, to which are attached\r\ntoothed bars, G and H. Above G place a portion of a toothed wheel, K,\r\nand, in like manner, beneath H a portion of a toothed wheel, L. Over\r\nall let there be a wheel, M, the inner rim of which is thicker than the\r\nouter; and let sections be cut out of this wheel by the three circles\r\nM, N and X, so that the interval between each division may\r\nbe equal to the radius of the wheel. Let the rim or felly be likewise\r\ndivided by the circles, so that the circumference of the wheel will\r\nno longer be a circle. Having made an incision, O P, in the upper\r\npart of the neck, and severed the head within the incision, make in\r\nit a circular cavity broader below than above, as it were a female\r\ntube shaped like an axe, which will contain two sides of the hexagon\r\ninscribed in the circle. Let this cavity be R S, in which the entire\r\nrim M N X will revolve in such a manner that, before one division\r\ndisappears, the beginning of the next will succeed, and similarly with\r\nthe third: so that, if a pin be inserted through the wheel, the wheel\r\nwill revolve, and the head of the animal adhere to the neck. Now, if\r\na knife is passed down through the incision O P, it will enter one of\r\nthe clefts of the wheel M, and confine it in the circular cavity; and,\r\ndescending lower, it will touch the projecting tooth of the part K of\r\nthe wheel, which, being forced downwards, will fit its teeth into those\r\nof the bar G, and the bar being pushed back will bring the cylinder\r\nout of the tube A B. The knife, passing through the intervening space,\r\nwill still descend and fall upon the projecting tooth of the part L of\r\nthe wheel; and this, being forced downwards, and fitting its teeth into\r\nthe toothed bar H, will drive the cylinder out of C D and fit it into A\r\nB. This cylinder is an interior tube fitted into the two tubes, that,\r\nnamely, in the mouth of the animal, and that reaching from the incision\r\nin the neck to the hinder foot. When the knife has passed quite through\r\nthe neck, and the tube E F has touched both A B and C D, let water be\r\noffered to the animal, and a pair of sliding tubes, placed under the\r\nherdsman, be turned round. When the herdsman revolves, the water above\r\nwill flow downwards along the tube C D E F A B, and the current of air\r\ncaused by the stream of water will attract the water offered to the\r\nmouth of the animal. Of course the sliding tubes are so arranged that,\r\nas the herdsman turns round, the holes in them coincide.\r\n\r\nThe same result can be brought about without the aid of a stream of\r\nwater in the following manner. Take once more a pedestal perfectly\r\nair-tight, A B C D (fig. 79), having a partition across the middle,\r\nE F. Let the tube from the mouth of the animal, G H K, lead into the\r\npedestal, and another tube, L M N, pass through the surface A D and\r\nthe partition E F. In the tube, L M N, perforate a hole, X, just above\r\nthe partition E F, and let another tube, O P, fit into it closely,\r\nhaving a hole, R, corresponding with the hole X. To the tube O P\r\nattach a figure of Pan, or some other figure with a fierce look, and,\r\nwhen the figure is turned towards the animal, it shall not drink, as\r\nthough frightened; when the figure turns away, it shall drink. Now, if\r\nwe pour water into the compartment A D E F through a hole, G´, which\r\nmust afterwards be carefully closed with wax or some other substance,\r\nit will be found that, if the holes R and X are made to coincide, the\r\nwater which was poured in will pass into the compartment E B C F. As A\r\nD E F becomes empty, it will attract the air through the mouth of the\r\nfigure, which will then drink when a cup is presented to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decorative floral border]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are four MSS. of Hero contained in the British Museum. Two belong\r\nto the Harleian Collection: they are numbered 5605 and 5589, and are\r\nassigned, the first to the fifteenth, the second to the sixteenth\r\ncentury; they are distinguished in the table below by the letters _a_\r\nand _b_. The others are among the Burney MSS., (108 and 81), and are\r\nboth assigned to the sixteenth century: they are cited as _c_ and _d_.\r\nOf these MSS. the first and third, (_a_ and _c_), are by far the most\r\ntrustworthy: they generally supply the clauses missing in the printed\r\ntext, and often furnish emendations of passages otherwise corrupt.\r\nThe other two agree, for the most part, with each other, and with the\r\nprinted text, both in the omission of numerous clauses and in the\r\ngrossest errors in individual words. It is thus rendered probable that\r\nthe defects of the Paris edition are in great measure due, not to the\r\nEditors, but to the MS. followed.\r\n\r\nIn the following table of emendations made in the text of Hero as it\r\nappears in the _Veterum Mathematicorum Opera_, those only have been\r\nnoticed which appeared curious or important. Many more have been passed\r\nover in which the correction was obvious even without the aid of any\r\nMS. The references are to the page and line of the Paris edition.\r\n\r\n  Page and    |                          |\r\n  Line of     |                          |\r\n   Paris      |                          |\r\n  edition.    |  Reading of Paris Text.  |      Reading adopted.\r\n  ------------+--------------------------+----------------------------\r\n  147 - 29    | συκίαν _a b d_.          | σικύαν _c_.\r\n  150 - 10    | ἐκφανείας                | ἐπιφανείας _a b c d_.\r\n   —  - 34    | τὴν—διαστολὴν            | κατὰ τὴν—διαστολὴν _a_.\r\n  151 -  8    | μυκτῆρσιν _d_.           | μυκτῆρσιν ἀέρος _a b c_.\r\n   —  - 51    | ὅσας                     | ὅσαι _a b c d_.\r\n  153 -  6    | βαθύτερον _d_.           | βαρύτερον _a b c_.\r\n   —  - 23    | στεγνὸν _d_.             | στενὸν _a c_.\r\n  155 -  3    | ἀντέχον _a c d_.         | ἀντέχων _b_.\r\n  156 -  1    | πνυκτικὸς _a b_.         | πνικτικὸς _c_.\r\n              |                          | Commandine reads\r\n              |                          | πνευματικὸς.\r\n   —  - 24    | ἀλλὰ τὸ μὴ _c_.          | ἀλλὰ τῷ μὴ _a b d_.\r\n   —  - 26    | ἀντεπεξίοντος            | ἀντὶ τοῦ ἐπεξίοντος _a b_\r\n              |                          | _c d_.\r\n  159 - 17    | τὸ ἐν τῷ ὑγρῷ            | τὸ ἐν ἀυτῷ ὑγρὸν _a c_.\r\n              | (τὸ εν τῷ ὑγρον _b_.)    |\r\n  161 -  2    | ἰσθμὸς                   | ἠθμὸς.

and secondly, by\r\npresenting to the reader a clear and impartial statement of what has\r\nbeen accomplished by each, viewed either as an original inventor, or\r\nas having been instrumental in promoting the means by which Steam\r\nNavigation has reached its present state of excellence.\r\n\r\nThe pretensions of the several inventors are accordingly arranged in\r\nthe order of time, and at such length as the limits of the work will\r\nadmit.\r\n\r\nThose who have explained the nature and principles of their inventions\r\nare afforded the advantages derivable from such explanations by\r\nquotations from their own writings; while other inventors or patentees,\r\nwho have not availed themselves of this mode of giving publicity to a\r\ndescription of the means by which they have endeavoured to supersede\r\nprior inventions, or to extend their utility, have the benefit of such\r\nremarks as have been elicited by the writings of their own countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe sketch accordingly commences by detailing facts which demonstrate\r\nthat the use of the Paddle-wheel as an instrument for propelling\r\nboats or vessels is of great antiquity, preceding by ages the first\r\nsuggestion of the application of steam as a motive power for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThis is succeeded by a recapitulation of the early projects for\r\npropelling vessels by the aid of the steam-engine, and of the various\r\nmodifications proposed or practically adopted at subsequent periods;\r\nthus placing before the reader the means of forming a just estimate of\r\nthe pretensions of the several projectors to be ranked as _the real\r\nauthors of the present system of Steam Navigation_.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, some of the instruments denominated Screw Propellers\r\nare duly noticed, with authentic statements of the results of various\r\nexperiments in which they were applied, and remarks on those generally\r\nin use in Europe and in the United States of America. It will be\r\nobvious that the facts thus detailed were widely scattered, and in\r\nsome few instances difficult of access: they have consequently been\r\ncollected and arranged from many sources, and the compilation is now\r\nsubmitted as forming a book of reference which may be found not only\r\nuseful, but interesting to those who seek for information as to the\r\norigin and progress of Steam Navigation.—_Preface._\r\n\r\n\r\n             LONDON: TAYLOR, WALTON, AND MABERLY, IVY LANE,\r\n                         PATERNOSTER ROW. 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustrations in this eBook have been positioned between paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe index was not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page\r\nreferences.\r\n\r\nObvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been corrected\r\nafter careful comparison with other occurrences within the text and\r\nconsultation of external sources.\r\n\r\nSome hyphens in words have been silently removed, some added, when a\r\npredominant preference was found in the original book.\r\n\r\nExcept for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text, and\r\ninconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pg xix: ‘which’ replaced by ‘the’ to match the title of the section.\r\n     117: ‘Spunge’ replaced by ‘Sponge’.",
