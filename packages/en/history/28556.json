ANTHONY,\r\n  17 MADISON ST., ROCHESTER, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1886, by SUSAN B. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe labors of those who have edited these volumes are not only\r\nfinished as far as this work extends, but if three-score years and\r\nten be the usual limit of human life, all our earthly endeavors\r\nmust end in the near future. After faithfully collecting material\r\nfor several years, and making the best selections our judgment has\r\ndictated, we are painfully conscious of many imperfections the\r\ncritical reader will perceive. But since stereotype plates will not\r\nreflect our growing sense of perfection, the lavish praise of\r\nfriends as to the merits of these pages will have its antidote in\r\nthe defects we ourselves discover. We may however without egotism\r\nexpress the belief that this volume will prove specially\r\ninteresting in having a large number of contributors from England,\r\nFrance, Canada and the United States, giving personal experiences\r\nand the progress of legislation in their respective localities.\r\n\r\nInto younger hands we must soon resign our work; but as long as\r\nhealth and vigor remain, we hope to publish a pamphlet report at\r\nthe close of each congressional term, containing whatever may be\r\naccomplished by State and National legislation, which can be\r\nreadily bound in volumes similar to these, thus keeping a full\r\nrecord of the prolonged battle until the final victory shall be\r\nachieved. To what extent these publications may be multiplied\r\ndepends on when the day of woman's emancipation shall dawn.\r\n\r\nFor the completion of this work we are indebted to Eliza Jackson\r\nEddy, the worthy daughter of that noble philanthropist, Francis\r\nJackson. He and Charles F. Hovey are the only men who have ever\r\nleft a generous bequest to the woman suffrage movement. To Mrs.\r\nEddy, who bequeathed to our cause two-thirds of her large fortune,\r\nbelong all honor and praise as the first woman who has given alike\r\nher sympathy and her wealth to this momentous and far-reaching\r\nreform. This heralds a turn in the tide of benevolence, when,\r\ninstead of building churches and monuments to great men, and\r\nendowing colleges for boys, women will make the education and\r\nenfranchisement of their own sex the chief object of their lives.\r\n\r\nThe three volumes now completed we leave as a precious heritage\r\nto coming generations; precious, because they so clearly\r\nillustrate--in her ability to reason, her deeds of heroism and her\r\nsublime self-sacrifice--that woman preeminently possesses the three\r\nessential elements of sovereignty as defined by Blackstone:\r\n\"wisdom, goodness and power.\" This has been to us a work of love,\r\nwritten without recompense and given without price to a large\r\ncircle of friends. A thousand copies have thus far been distributed\r\namong our coadjutors in the old world and the new. Another thousand\r\nhave found an honored place in the leading libraries, colleges and\r\nuniversities of Europe and America, from which we have received\r\nnumerous testimonies of their value as a standard work of reference\r\nfor those who are investigating this question. Extracts from these\r\npages are being translated into every living language, and, like so\r\nmany missionaries, are bearing the glad gospel of woman's\r\nemancipation to all civilized nations.\r\n\r\nSince the inauguration of this reform, propositions to extend the\r\nright of suffrage to women have been submitted to the popular vote\r\nin Kansas, Michigan, Colorado, Nebraska and Oregon, and lost by\r\nlarge majorities in all; while, by a simple act of legislature,\r\nWyoming, Utah and Washington territories have enfranchised their\r\nwomen without going through the slow process of a constitutional\r\namendment. In New York, the State that has led this movement, and\r\nin which there has been a more continued agitation than in any\r\nother, we are now pressing on the legislature the consideration\r\nthat it has the same power to extend the right of suffrage to women\r\nthat it has so often exercised in enfranchising different classes\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nEminent publicists have long conceded this power to State\r\nlegislatures as well as to congress, declaring that women as\r\ncitizens of the United States have the right to vote, and that a\r\nsimple enabling act is all that is needed. The constitutionality of\r\nsuch an act was never questioned until the legislative power was\r\ninvoked for the enfranchisement of women. We who have studied our\r\nrepublican institutions and understand the limits of the executive,\r\njudicial and legislative branches of the government, are aware that\r\nthe legislature, directly representing the people, is the primary\r\nsource of power, above all courts and constitutions. Research into\r\nthe early history of this country shows that in line with English\r\nprecedent, women did vote in the old colonial days and in the\r\noriginal thirteen States of the Union. Hence we are fully awake to\r\nthe fact that our struggle is not for the attainment of a new\r\nright, but for the restitution of one our fore-mothers possessed\r\nand exercised.\r\n\r\nAll thoughtful readers must close these volumes with a deeper sense\r\nof the superior dignity, self-reliance and independence that belong\r\nby nature to woman, enabling her to rise above such multifarious\r\npersecutions as she has encountered, and with persistent\r\nself-assertion to maintain her rights. In the history of the race\r\nthere has been no struggle for liberty like this. Whenever the\r\ninterest of the ruling classes has induced them to confer new\r\nrights on a subject class, it has been done with no effort on the\r\npart of the latter. Neither the American slave nor the English\r\nlaborer demanded the right of suffrage. It was given in both cases\r\nto strengthen the liberal party. The philanthropy of the few may\r\nhave entered into those reforms, but political expediency carried\r\nboth measures. Women, on the contrary, have fought their own\r\nbattles; and in their rebellion against existing conditions have\r\ninaugurated the most fundamental revolution the world has ever\r\nwitnessed. The magnitude and multiplicity of the changes\r\ninvolved make the obstacles in the way of success seem almost\r\ninsurmountable.\r\n\r\nThe narrow self-interest of all classes is opposed to the\r\nsovereignty of woman. The rulers in the State are not willing to\r\nshare their power with a class equal if not superior to themselves,\r\nover which they could never hope for absolute control, and whose\r\nmethods of government might in many respects differ from their own.\r\nThe annointed leaders in the Church are equally hostile to freedom\r\nfor a sex supposed for wise purposes to have been subordinated by\r\ndivine decree. The capitalist in the world of work holds the key to\r\nthe trades and professions, and undermines the power of labor\r\nunions in their struggles for shorter hours and fairer wages, by\r\nsubstituting the cheap labor of a disfranchised class, that cannot\r\norganize its forces, thus making wife and sister rivals of husband\r\nand brother in the industries, to the detriment of both classes. Of\r\nthe autocrat in the home, John Stuart Mill has well said: \"No\r\nordinary man is willing to find at his own fireside an equal in the\r\nperson he calls wife.\" Thus society is based on this fourfold\r\nbondage of woman, making liberty and equality for her antagonistic\r\nto every organized institution. Where, then, can we rest the lever\r\nwith which to lift one-half of humanity from these depths of\r\ndegradation but on \"that columbiad of our political life--the\r\nballot--which makes every citizen who holds it a full-armed\r\nmonitor\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ENGRAVINGS.\r\n\r\nVOL.

It was at first\r\nproposed to distribute the stock among the people of the different\r\nStates and territories according to the ratio of their population,\r\nbut subscriptions were afterward received without regard to States.\r\nThe stockholders organized a board of directors, April 1, 1873. The\r\ndesign of the exhibition was to make it a comprehensive display of\r\nthe industrial, intellectual and moral progress of the nation\r\nduring the first century of its existence; but by the earnest\r\ninvitation of our government foreign nations so generally\r\nparticipated that it was truly, as its name implied, an\r\n\"International and World's Exposition.\"\r\n\r\nThe centennial year opened amid the wildest rejoicing. In honor of\r\nthe nation's birthday extensive preparations were made for the\r\ngreat event. Crowds of people eager to participate in the\r\ncelebration, everywhere flocked from the adjacent country to the\r\nnearest village or city, filling the streets and adding to the\r\ngeneral gala look, all through the day and evening of December 31,\r\n1875. From early gas-light upon every side the blowing of horns,\r\nthrowing of torpedos, explosion of fire-crackers, gave premonition\r\nof more enthusiastic exultation. As the clock struck twelve every\r\nhouse suddenly blossomed with red, white and blue; public and\r\nprivate buildings burst into a blaze of light that rivaled the\r\nnoon-day sun, while screaming whistles, booming cannon, pealing\r\nbells, joyous music and brilliant fire-works made the midnight\r\nwhich ushered in the centennial 1876, a never-to-be-forgotten hour.\r\n\r\nPortraits of the presidents from Washington and Lincoln\r\nlaurel-crowned, to Grant, sword in hand, met the eye on every side.\r\nStars in flames of fire lighted the foreign flags of welcome to\r\nother nations. Every window, door and roof-top was filled with gay\r\nand joyous people. Carriages laden with men, women and children in\r\nholiday attire enthusiastically waving the national flag and\r\nsinging its songs of freedom. Battalions of soldiers marched\r\nthrough the streets; Roman candles, whizzing rockets, and\r\ngaily-colored balloons shot upward, filling the sky with trails of\r\nfire and adding to the brilliancy of the scene, while all minor\r\nsounds were drowned in the martial music. Thus did the old world\r\nand the new commemorate the birth of a nation founded on the\r\nprinciple of self-government.\r\n\r\nThe prolonged preparations for the centennial celebration naturally\r\nroused the women of the nation to new thought as to their status as\r\ncitizens of a republic, as well as to their rightful share in the\r\nprogress of the century. The oft-repeated declarations of the\r\nfathers had a deeper significance for those who realized the\r\ndegradation of disfranchisement, and they queried with each other\r\nas to what part, with becoming self-respect, they could take in the\r\ncoming festivities.[1] Woman's achievements in art, science and\r\nindustry would necessarily be recognized in the Exposition; but\r\nwith the dawn of a new era, after a hundred years of education in a\r\nrepublic, she asked more than a simple recognition of the products\r\nof her hand and brain; with her growing intelligence, virtue and\r\npatriotism, she demanded the higher ideal of womanhood that should\r\nwelcome her as an equal factor in government, with all the rights\r\nand honors of citizenship fully accorded. During the entire\r\ncentury, women who understood the genius of free institutions had\r\never and anon made their indignant protests in both public and\r\nprivate before State legislatures, congressional committees and\r\nstatesmen at their own firesides; and now, after discussing the\r\nright of self-government so exhaustively in the late anti-slavery\r\nconflict, it seemed to them that the time had come to make some\r\napplication of these principles to the women of the nation. Hence\r\nit was with a deeper sense of injustice than ever before that the\r\nNational Suffrage Association issued the call for the annual\r\nWashington Convention of 1876:\r\n\r\n     CALL FOR THE EIGHTH ANNUAL WASHINGTON CONVENTION.--The National\r\n     Woman Suffrage Association will hold its Eighth Annual Convention\r\n     in Tallmadge Hall, Washington, D. C., January 27, 28, 1876. In\r\n     this one-hundredth year of the Republic, the women of the United\r\n     States will once more assemble under the shadow of the national\r\n     capitol to press their claims to self-government.\r\n\r\n     That property has its rights, was acknowledged in England long\r\n     before the revolutionary war, and this recognized right made \"no\r\n     taxation without representation\" the most effective battle-cry of\r\n     that period. But the question of property representation fades\r\n     from view beside the greater question of the right of each\r\n     individual, millionaire or pauper, to personal representation. In\r\n     the progress of the war our fathers grew in wisdom, and the\r\n     Declaration of Independence was the first national assertion of\r\n     the right of individual representation. That \"governments derive\r\n     their just powers from the consent of the governed,\"\r\n     thenceforward became the watchword of the world. Our flag, which\r\n     beckons the emigrant from every foreign shore, means to him\r\n     self-government.\r\n\r\n     But while in theory our government recognizes the rights of all\r\n     people, in practice it is far behind the Declaration of\r\n     Independence and the national constitution. On what just ground\r\n     is discrimination made between men and women? Why should women,\r\n     more than men, be governed without their own consent? Why should\r\n     women, more than men, be denied trial by a jury of their peers?\r\n     On what authority are women taxed while unrepresented? By what\r\n     right do men declare themselves invested with power to legislate\r\n     for women? For the discussion of these vital questions friends\r\n     are invited to take part in the convention.\r\n\r\n                 MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, _President_, Fayetteville, N. Y.\r\n\r\n     SUSAN B. ANTHONY, _Ch'n Ex. Com._, Rochester, N. Y.\r\n\r\nAt the opening session of this convention the president, Matilda\r\nJoslyn Gage, said:\r\n\r\n     I would remind you, fellow-citizens, that this is our first\r\n     convention in the dawn of the new century. In 1776 we inaugurated\r\n     our experiment of self-government. Unbelief in man's capacity to\r\n     govern himself was freely expressed by every European monarchy\r\n     except France. When John Adams was Minister to England, the\r\n     newspapers of that country were filled with prophecies that the\r\n     new-born republic would soon gladly return to British allegiance.\r\n     But these hundred years have taught them the worth of liberty;\r\n     the Declaration of Independence has become the alphabet of\r\n     nations; Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and the isles of the\r\n     sea, will unite this year to do our nation honor. Our flag is\r\n     everywhere on sea and land. It has searched the North Pole,\r\n     explored every desert, upheld religious liberty of every faith\r\n     and protected political refugees from every nation, but it has\r\n     not yet secured equal rights to women.\r\n\r\n     This year is to be one of general discussion upon the science of\r\n     government; its origin, its powers, its history. If our present\r\n     declaration cannot be so interpreted as to cover the rights of\r\n     women, we must issue one that will. I have received letters from\r\n     many of the Western States and from this District, urging us to\r\n     prepare a woman's declaration, and to celebrate the coming Fourth\r\n     of July with our own chosen orators and in our own way. I notice\r\n     a general awakening among women at this time. But a day or two\r\n     since the women of this District demanded suffrage for themselves\r\n     in a petition of 25,000 names. The men are quiet under their\r\n     disfranchisement, making no attempt for their rights--fit slaves\r\n     of a powerful ring.\r\n\r\nThe following protest was presented by Mrs. Gage, adopted by the\r\nconvention, printed and extensively circulated:\r\n\r\n     _To the Political Sovereigns of the United States in Independence\r\n     Hall assembled:_\r\n\r\n     We, the undersigned women of the United States, asserting our\r\n     faith in the principles of the Declaration of Independence and in\r\n     the constitution of the United States, proclaiming it as the best\r\n     form of government in the world, declare ourselves a part of the\r\n     people of the nation unjustly deprived of the guaranteed and\r\n     reserved rights belonging to citizens of the United States;\r\n     because we have never given our consent to this government;\r\n     because we have never delegated our rights to others; because\r\n     this government is false to its underlying principles; because it\r\n     has refused to one-half its citizens the only means of\r\n     self-government--the ballot; because it has been deaf to our\r\n     appeals, our petitions and our prayers;\r\n\r\n     Therefore, in presence of the assembled nations of all the world,\r\n     we protest against this government of the United States as an\r\n     oligarchy of sex, and not a true republic; and we protest against\r\n     calling this a centennial celebration of the independence of the\r\n     people of the United States.\r\n\r\nLetters[2] were read and a series of resolutions were discussed and\r\nadopted:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the demand for woman suffrage is but the\r\n          next step in the great movement which began with _Magna\r\n          Charta_, and which has ever since tended toward vesting\r\n          government in the whole body of the people.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That we demand of the forty-fourth congress, in\r\n          order that it may adequately celebrate the centennial year,\r\n          the admission to the polls of the women of all the\r\n          territories, and a submission to the legislatures of the\r\n          several States of an amendment securing to women the\r\n          elective franchise.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the enfranchisement of women means wiser\r\n          and truer wedlock, purer and happier homes, healthier and\r\n          better children, and strikes, as nothing else does, at the\r\n          very roots of pauperism and crime.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That if Colorado would come into the Union in a\r\n          befitting manner for the celebration of the centennial of\r\n          the Declaration of Independence, she should give the ballot\r\n          to brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, and thus\r\n          present to the nation a truly free State.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the right of suffrage being vested in the\r\n          women of Utah by their constitutional and lawful\r\n          enfranchisement, and by six years of use, we denounce the\r\n          proposition about to be again presented to congress for the\r\n          disfranchisement of the women in that territory, as an\r\n          outrage on the freedom of thousands of legal voters and a\r\n          gross innovation of vested rights; we demand the abolition\r\n          of the system of numbering the ballots, in order that the\r\n          women may be thoroughly free to vote as they choose, without\r\n          supervision or dictation, and that the chair appoint a\r\n          committee of three persons, with power to add to their\r\n          number, to memorialize congress, and otherwise to watch over\r\n          the rights of the women of Utah in this regard during the\r\n          next twelve months.\r\n\r\n     BELVA A. LOCKWOOD presented the annual report: The question of\r\n     woman suffrage is to be submitted to the people of Iowa during\r\n     the present centennial year, if this legislature ratifies the\r\n     action of the previous one. Colorado has not embodied the word\r\n     \"male\" in her constitution, and a vigorous effort is being made\r\n     to introduce woman suffrage there. In Minnesota women are allowed\r\n     to vote on school questions and to hold office by a recent\r\n     constitutional amendment. In Michigan, in 1874, the vote for\r\n     woman suffrage was 40,000, about 1,000 more votes than were\r\n     polled for the new constitution. The Connecticut legislature,\r\n     during the past year appointed a committee to consider and report\r\n     the expediency of making women eligible to the position of\r\n     electors for president and vice-president. The committee made a\r\n     unanimous report in its favor, and secured for its passage 82\r\n     votes, while 101 votes were cast against it. In Massachusetts,\r\n     Governor Rice, in his inaugural address, recommended to the\r\n     legislature to secure to women the right to vote for presidential\r\n     electors. An address to the legislature of New York by Mesdames\r\n     Gage, Blake and Lozier upon this question, was favorably received\r\n     and extensively quoted by the press. At an agricultural fair in\r\n     Illinois the Hon. James R. Doolittle advocated household\r\n     suffrage. In the Senate of the thirteenth legislature of the\r\n     State of Texas, Senator Dohoney, Chairman of the Judiciary\r\n     Committee, made a report strongly advocating woman suffrage; and\r\n     in 1875, when a member of the Constitutional Convention, he\r\n     advocated the same doctrine, and was ably assisted by Hon. W. G.\r\n     L. Weaver. The governor of that State, in his message,\r\n     recommended that women school teachers should receive equal pay\r\n     for equal work. The word \"male\" does not occur in the new\r\n     constitution. In the territories of Wyoming and Utah, woman\r\n     suffrage still continues after five years' experiment, and we\r\n     have not learned that households have been broken up or that\r\n     babies have ceased to be rocked.\r\n\r\n     Women physicians, women journalists and women editors have come\r\n     to be a feature of our institutions. Laura De Force Gordon, a\r\n     member of our association, is editing a popular daily--the\r\n     _Leader_--in Sacramento, Cal. Women are now admitted to the bar\r\n     in Kansas, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Utah, Wyoming and\r\n     the District of Columbia. They are eligible and are serving as\r\n     school superintendents in Kansas, Nebraska, Illinois, Iowa and\r\n     Wisconsin. Illinois allows them to be notaries public. As\r\n     postmasters they have proved competent, and one woman, Miss Ada\r\n     Sweet, is pension agent at Chicago. Julia K. Sutherland has been\r\n     appointed commissioner of deeds for the State of California. In\r\n     England women vote on the same terms as men on municipal,\r\n     parochial and educational matters. In Holland, Austria and\r\n     Sweden, women vote on a property qualification. The Peruvian\r\n     Minister of Justice has declared that Peru places women on the\r\n     same footing as men. Thus all over the world is the idea of human\r\n     rights taking root and cropping out in a healthful rather than a\r\n     spasmodic outgrowth.\r\n\r\n     The grand-daughter of Paley, true to her ancestral blood, has\r\n     excelled all the young men in Cambridge in moral science. Julia\r\n     J. Thomas, of Cornell University, daughter of Dr. Mary F. Thomas,\r\n     of Indiana, in the recent inter-collegiate contest, took the\r\n     first prize of $300, over eight male competitors, in Greek. The\r\n     recent decision in the United States Supreme Court, of Minor\r\n     _vs._ Happersett, will have as much force in suppressing the\r\n     individuality and self-assertion of women as had the opinion of\r\n     Judge Taney, in the Dred-Scott case, in suppressing the\r\n     emancipation of slavery. The day has come when precedents are\r\n     made rather than blindly followed. The refusal of the Superior\r\n     Court of Philadelphia to allow Carrie S. Burnham to practice law,\r\n     because there was no precedent, was a weak evasion of common law\r\n     and common sense. One hundred years ago there was no precedent\r\n     for a man practicing law in the State of Pennsylvania, and yet we\r\n     have not learned that there was any difficulty in establishing a\r\n     precedent. I do not now remember any precedent for the\r\n     Declaration of Independence of the United Colonies, and yet\r\n     during a century it has not been overturned. The rebellion of the\r\n     South had no precedent, and yet, if I remember, there was an\r\n     issue joined, and the United States found that she had\r\n     jurisdiction of the case.\r\n\r\n     The admission of women to Cornell University; their reception on\r\n     equal footing in Syracuse University, receiving in both equal\r\n     honorary degrees; the establishment of Wellesley College, with\r\n     full professorships and capable women to fill them; the agitation\r\n     of the question in Washington of the establishment of a\r\n     university for women, all show a mental awakening in the popular\r\n     mind not hitherto known. A new era is opening in the history of\r\n     the world. The seed sown twenty-five years ago by Mrs. Stanton\r\n     and other brave women is bearing fruit.\r\n\r\n     SARA ANDREWS SPENCER said it was interesting to pair off the\r\n     objections and let them answer each other like paradoxes. Women\r\n     will be influenced by their husbands and will vote for bad men to\r\n     please them. Women have too much influence now, and if we give\r\n     them any more latitude they will make men all vote their way.\r\n     Owing to the composition and structure of the female brain, women\r\n     are incapable of understanding political affairs. If women are\r\n     allowed to vote they will crowd all the men out of office, and\r\n     men will be obliged to stay at home and take care of the\r\n     children. That is, owing to the composition and structure of the\r\n     female brain, women are so exactly adapted to political affairs\r\n     that men wouldn't stand any chance if women were allowed to enter\r\n     into competition with them. Women don't want it. Women shouldn't\r\n     have it, for they don't know how to use it. Grace Greenwood (who\r\n     was one of the seventy-two women who tried to vote) said men were\r\n     like the stingy boy at school with a cake. \"Now,\" said he, \"all\r\n     you that don't ask for it don't want it, and all you that do ask\r\n     for it sha'n't have it.\"\r\n\r\n     REV. OLYMPIA BROWN, pastor of the Universalist church in\r\n     Bridgeport, Conn., gave her views on the rights of women under\r\n     the constitution, and believed that they were entitled to the\r\n     ballot as an inalienable right. In this country, under existing\r\n     rulings of the courts as to the meaning of the constitution, no\r\n     one appeared likely to enjoy the ballot for all time except the\r\n     colored men, unless the clause, \"previous condition of\r\n     servitude,\" as a congressman expressed it, referred to widows.\r\n     That being true, the constitution paid a premium only on colored\r\n     men, and widows. If the constitution did not guarantee suffrage,\r\n     and congress did not bestow it, then the republic was of no\r\n     account and its boast devoid of significance and meaning. Its\r\n     life had been in vain--dead to the interests for which it was\r\n     created. She wanted congress to pass a sixteenth amendment,\r\n     declaring all its citizens enfranchised, or a declaratory act\r\n     setting forth that the constitution already guaranteed to them\r\n     that right.\r\n\r\n     Hon. FREDERICK DOUGLASS said he was not quite in accord with all\r\n     the sentiments that had been uttered during the afternoon, yet he\r\n     was willing that the largest latitude should be taken by the\r\n     advocates of the cause. He was not afraid that at some distant\r\n     period the blacks of the South would rise and disfranchise the\r\n     whites. While he was not willing to be addressed as the ignorant,\r\n     besotted creature that the negro is sometimes called, he was\r\n     willing to be a part of the bridge over which women should march\r\n     to the full enjoyment of their rights.\r\n\r\n     Miss PHOEBE COUZINS of St. Louis reviewed in an able manner the\r\n     decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Virginia L. Minor.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. DEVEREUX BLAKE spoke on the rights and duties of\r\n     citizenship. She cited a number of authorities, including a\r\n     recent decision of the Supreme Court, to prove that women are\r\n     citizens, although deprived of the privileges of citizenship.\r\n     Taking up the three duties of citizenship--paying taxes, serving\r\n     on jury, and military service--she said woman had done her share\r\n     of the first for a hundred years; that the women of the country\r\n     now contributed, directly and indirectly, one-third of its\r\n     revenues, and that the House of Representatives had just robbed\r\n     them of $500,000 to pay for a centennial celebration in which\r\n     they had no part. As for serving on jury, they did not claim that\r\n     as a privilege, as it was usually regarded as a most disagreeable\r\n     duty; but they did claim the right of women, when arraigned in\r\n     court, to be tried by a jury of their peers, which was not\r\n     accorded when the jury was composed wholly of men. Lastly, as to\r\n     serving their country in time of war, it was a fact that women\r\n     had actually enlisted and fought in our late war, until their sex\r\n     was discovered, when they were summarily dismissed without being\r\n     paid for their services.\r\n\r\nHon. Aaron A. Sargent, of California, in the United States\r\nSenate, and Hon. Samuel S. Cox, of New York, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, presented the memorial asking the enfranchisement\r\nof the women of the District of Columbia, as follows:\r\n\r\n                              IN THE SENATE, Tuesday, January 25, 1876.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SARGENT: I present a memorial asking for the establishment of\r\n     a government in the District of Columbia which shall secure to\r\n     its women the right to vote. This petition is signed by many\r\n     eminent ladies of the country: Mrs. Matilda Joslyn Gage,\r\n     President of the National Woman Suffrage Association, and the\r\n     following officers of that society: Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady\r\n     Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Henrietta Payne Westbrook, Isabella\r\n     Beecher Hooker, Mathilde F. Wendt, Ellen Clark Sargent; also by\r\n     Mary F. Foster, President of the District of Columbia Woman's\r\n     Franchise Association; Susan A. Edson, M. D.; Mrs. E. D. E. N.\r\n     Southworth, the distinguished authoress; Mrs. Dr. Caroline B.\r\n     Winslow; Belva A. Lockwood, a practicing lawyer in this District;\r\n     Sara Andrews Spencer, and Mrs. A. E. Wood.\r\n\r\n     These intelligent ladies set forth their petition in language and\r\n     with facts and arguments which I think should meet the ear of the\r\n     Senate, and I ask that it be read by the secretary in order that\r\n     their desires may be known.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: Is there objection? The chair hears\r\n     none, and the secretary will report the petition. The secretary\r\n     read:\r\n\r\n          _To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\n          States in Congress assembled:_\r\n\r\n          Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States has affirmed\r\n          the decision of the Supreme Court of the District of\r\n          Columbia in the cases of Spencer _vs._ The Board of\r\n          Registration, and Webster _vs._ The Judges of Election, and\r\n          has decided that \"by the operation of the first section of\r\n          the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\n          States, women have been advanced to full citizenship and\r\n          clothed with the capacity to become voters; and further,\r\n          that this first section of the fourteenth amendment does not\r\n          execute itself, but requires the supervision of legislative\r\n          power in the exercise of legislative discretion to give it\r\n          effect\"; and whereas the congress of the United States is\r\n          the legislative body having exclusive jurisdiction over the\r\n          District of Columbia, and in enfranchising the colored men\r\n          and refusing to enfranchise women, white or colored, made an\r\n          unjust discrimination against sex, and did not give the\r\n          intelligence and moral power of the citizens of said\r\n          District a fair opportunity for expression at the polls; and\r\n          whereas woman suffrage is not an experiment, but has had a\r\n          fair trial in Wyoming, where women hold office, where they\r\n          vote, where they have the most orderly society of any of the\r\n          territories, where the experiment is approved by the\r\n          executive officers of the United States, by their courts, by\r\n          their press and by the people generally, and where it has\r\n          \"rescued that territory from a state of comparative\r\n          lawlessness\" and rendered it \"one of the most orderly in the\r\n          Union\"; and whereas upon the woman suffrage amendment to\r\n          Senate bill number 44 of the second session of the\r\n          forty-third congress, votes were recorded in favor of woman\r\n          suffrage by the two senators from Indiana, the two from\r\n          Florida, the two from Michigan, the two from Rhode Island,\r\n          one from Kansas, one from Louisiana, one from Massachusetts,\r\n          one from Minnesota, one from Nebraska, one from Nevada, one\r\n          from Oregon, one from South Carolina, one from Texas, and\r\n          one from Wisconsin; and whereas a fair trial of equal\r\n          suffrage for men and women in the District of Columbia,\r\n          under the immediate supervision of congress, would\r\n          demonstrate to the people of the whole country that justice\r\n          to women is policy for men; and whereas the women of the\r\n          United States are governed without their own consent, are\r\n          denied trial by a jury of their peers, are taxed without\r\n          representation, and are subject to manifold wrongs resulting\r\n          from unjust and arbitrary exercise of power over an\r\n          unrepresented class; and whereas in this centennial year of\r\n          the republic the spirit of 1776 is breathing its influence\r\n          upon the people, melting away prejudices and animosities and\r\n          infusing into our national councils a finer sense of justice\r\n          and a clearer perception of individual rights; therefore,\r\n\r\n          We pray your honorable body to establish a government for\r\n          the District of Columbia which shall secure to its women the\r\n          right to vote.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SARGEANT: Even if this document were not accompanied by the\r\n     signatures of eminent ladies known throughout the land for their\r\n     virtues, intelligence and high character, the considerations\r\n     which it presents would be worthy of the attention of the senate.\r\n     I have no doubt that the great movement of which this is a part\r\n     will prevail. It is working its progress day by day throughout\r\n     the country. It is making itself felt both in social and\r\n     political life. The petitioners here well say that there has been\r\n     a successful experiment of the exercise of female suffrage in one\r\n     of our territories; that a territory has been redeemed from\r\n     lawlessness; that the judges, the press, the people generally of\r\n     Wyoming approve the results of this great experiment. I know of\r\n     no better place than the capital of a nation where a more\r\n     decisive trial can be made, if such is needed, to establish the\r\n     expediency of woman suffrage. As to its justice, who shall deny\r\n     it? I ask, for the purpose of due consideration, that this\r\n     petition be referred to the Committee on the District of\r\n     Columbia, so that in preparing any scheme for the government of\r\n     the District which is likely to come before this congress, due\r\n     weight may be given to the considerations presented.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The petition will be referred to the\r\n     Committee on the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n               IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, Friday, March 31, 1876.\r\n\r\n     Mr. COX: Mr. Speaker, I am requested to present a memorial,\r\n     asking for a form of government in the District of Columbia which\r\n     shall secure to its women the right to vote; and I ask the grace\r\n     and favor to have this memorial printed in the _Record_.\r\n\r\n     Mr. BANKS: Mr. Speaker, I beg the privilege of saying a few words\r\n     in favor of the request made by the gentleman from New York who\r\n     presents this memorial. It is a hundred years this day since Mrs.\r\n     Abigail Adams, of Massachusetts, wrote to her husband, John\r\n     Adams, then a member of the continental convention, entreating\r\n     him to give to women the power to protect their own rights and\r\n     predicting a general revolution if justice was denied them. Mrs.\r\n     Adams was one of the noblest women of that period, distinguished\r\n     by heroism and patriotism never surpassed in any age. She was\r\n     wife of the second and mother of the sixth president of the\r\n     United States, and her beneficent influence was felt in political\r\n     as well as in social circles. It was perhaps the first demand for\r\n     the recognition of the rights of her sex made in this country,\r\n     and is one of the centennial incidents that should be remembered.\r\n     It came from a good quarter. This memorial represents half a\r\n     million of American women. They ask for the organization of a\r\n     government in the District of Columbia that will recognize their\r\n     political rights. I voted some years ago to give women the right\r\n     to vote in this District, and recalling the course of its\r\n     government I think it would have done no harm if they had enjoyed\r\n     political rights.\r\n\r\n     Mr. KASSON: I suggest that the memorial be printed without the\r\n     names.\r\n\r\n     Mr. COX: There are no names appended except those of the officers\r\n     of the National Woman Suffrage Association; and I hope they will\r\n     be printed with the memorial.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HENDEE: I trust the gentleman will allow this petition to be\r\n     referred to the committee of which I am a member: the Committee\r\n     for the District of Columbia. There being no objection, the\r\n     memorial was read and referred to the Committee for the District\r\n     of Columbia, and ordered to be printed in the _Record_.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the convention a hearing was granted to the ladies\r\nbefore the committees of the Senate and House of Representatives on\r\nthe District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n     MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, of New York, said: _Mr. Chairman and\r\n     Gentlemen of the Committee_: On behalf of the National\r\n     Association, which has its officers in every State and territory\r\n     of the Union, and which numbers many thousands of members, and on\r\n     behalf of the Woman's Franchise Association of the District of\r\n     Columbia, we appear before you, asking that the right of suffrage\r\n     be secured equally to the men and women of this District. Art. 1,\r\n     sec. 8, clauses 17, 18 of the Constitution of the United States\r\n     reads:\r\n\r\n          Congress shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation\r\n          in all cases whatsoever over such district as may become the\r\n          seat of government of the United States, * * * * * to make\r\n          all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying\r\n          into execution the foregoing powers.\r\n\r\n     Congress is therefore constitutionally the special guardian of\r\n     the rights of the people of the District of Columbia. It\r\n     possesses peculiar rights, peculiar duties, peculiar powers in\r\n     regard to this District. At the present time the men and women\r\n     are alike disfranchised. Our memorial asks that in forming a new\r\n     government they may be alike enfranchised. It is often said as\r\n     an argument against granting suffrage to women that they do not\r\n     wish to vote; do not ask for the ballot. This association,\r\n     numbering thousands in the United States, through its\r\n     representatives, now asks you, in this memorial, for suffrage in\r\n     this District. Petitions from every State in the Union have been\r\n     sent to your honorable body. One of these, signed by thirty-five\r\n     thousand women, was sent to congress in one large roll; but what\r\n     is the value of a petition signed by even a million of an\r\n     unrepresented class?\r\n\r\n     The city papers of the national capital, once bitterly opposed to\r\n     all effort in this direction, now fully recognize the dignity of\r\n     the demand, and have ceased to oppose it. One of these said,\r\n     editorially, to-day, that the vast audiences assembling at our\r\n     conventions, the large majority being women, and evidently in\r\n     sympathy with the movement, were proof of the great interest\r\n     women take in this subject, though many are too timid to openly\r\n     make the demand. The woman's temperance movement began two years\r\n     ago as a crusade of prayer and song, and the women engaged\r\n     therein have now resolved themselves into a national\r\n     organization, whose second convention, held in October last,\r\n     numbering delegates from twenty-two States, almost unanimously\r\n     passed a resolution demanding the ballot to aid them in their\r\n     temperance work. We who make our constant demand for suffrage,\r\n     knew that these women were in process of education, and would\r\n     soon be forced to ask for the key to all reform.\r\n\r\n     The ballot says yes or no to all questions. Without it women are\r\n     prohibited from practically expressing their opinions. The very\r\n     fact that the women of this District make this demand of you more\r\n     urgently than men proves that they desire it more and see its\r\n     uses better. The men of this District who quietly remain\r\n     disfranchised have the spirit of slaves, and if asking for the\r\n     ballot is any proof of fitness for its use, then the women who do\r\n     ask for it here prove themselves in this respect superior to men,\r\n     more alive to the interests of this District, and better fitted\r\n     to administer the government. Women who are not interested in\r\n     questions of reform would soon become so if they possessed the\r\n     ballot. They are now in the condition we were when we heard of\r\n     the famine in Persia two years ago. Our sympathies were aroused\r\n     for a brief while, but Persia was far away, we could render it no\r\n     certain aid, and the sufferings of the people soon passed from\r\n     our minds.\r\n\r\n     Our approaching centennial celebration is to commemorate the\r\n     Declaration of Independence, which was based on individual\r\n     rights. For ages it was a question where the governing power\r\n     rightfully belonged; patriarch, priest, and monarch each claimed\r\n     it by divine right. Our country declared it vested in the\r\n     individual. Not only was this clearly stated in the Declaration\r\n     of Independence, but the same ground was maintained in the secret\r\n     proceedings upon framing the constitution. The old confederation\r\n     was abandoned because it did not secure the independence and\r\n     safety of the people. It has recently been asked in congressional\r\n     debates, \"What is the grand idea of the centennial?\" The answer\r\n     was, \"It is the illustration in spirit and truth of the\r\n     principles of the Declaration of Independence and of the\r\n     constitution.\"\r\n\r\n     These principles are:\r\n\r\n     _First_--The natural rights of each individual.\r\n\r\n     _Second_--The exact equality of these rights.\r\n\r\n     _Third_--That rights not delegated are retained by the\r\n     individual.\r\n\r\n     _Fourth_--That no person shall exercise the rights of others\r\n     without delegated authority.\r\n\r\n     _Fifth_--That non-use of rights does not destroy them.\r\n\r\n     Rights did not come new-born into the world with the revolution.\r\n     Our fathers were men of middle age before they understood their\r\n     own rights, but when they did they compelled the recognition of\r\n     the world, and now the nations of the earth are this year invited\r\n     to join you in the celebration of these principles of free\r\n     government.\r\n\r\n     We have special reasons for asking you to secure suffrage to the\r\n     women of the District of Columbia. Woman Suffrage has been tried\r\n     in Wyoming, and ample testimony of its beneficial results has\r\n     been furnished, but it is a far distant territory, and those not\r\n     especially interested will not examine the evidence. It has been\r\n     tried in Utah, but with great opposition on account of the\r\n     peculiar religious belief and customs of the people. But the\r\n     District of Columbia is directly under the eye of congress. It is\r\n     the capital of the nation, and three-fifths of the property of\r\n     the District belongs to the United States. The people of the\r\n     whole country would therefore be interested in observing the\r\n     practical workings of this system on national soil. With 7,316\r\n     more women than men in this District, we call your special\r\n     attention to the inconsistency and injustice of granting suffrage\r\n     to a minority and withholding it from a majority, as you have\r\n     done in the past. If the District is your special ward, then\r\n     women, being in the majority here, have peculiar claims upon you\r\n     for a consideration of their rights. The freedom of this country\r\n     is only half won. The women of to-day have less freedom than our\r\n     fathers of the revolution, for they were permitted local\r\n     self-government, while women have no share in local, State, or\r\n     general government.\r\n\r\n     Our memorial calls your attention to the Pembina debate in 1874,\r\n     when senators from eighteen States recognized the right of\r\n     self-government as inhering in women. One senator said: \"I\r\n     believe women never will enjoy equality with men in taking care\r\n     of themselves until they have the right to vote.\" Another, \"that\r\n     the question was being considered by a large portion of the\r\n     people of the United States.\" When the discussion was concluded\r\n     and the vote taken, twenty-two senators recorded their votes for\r\n     woman suffrage in that distant territory. During the debate\r\n     several senators publicly declared their intention of voting for\r\n     woman suffrage in the District of Columbia whenever the\r\n     opportunity was presented. These senators recognize the fact that\r\n     the ballot is not only a right, but that it is opportunity for\r\n     woman; that it is the one means of helping her to help herself.\r\n     In asking you to secure the ballot to the women of the District\r\n     we do not ask you to create a right. That is beyond your power.\r\n     We ask you to protect them in the exercise of a right.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. SARA ANDREWS SPENCER, Secretary of the District of Columbia\r\n     Woman's Franchise Association, said: For no legal or political\r\n     right I have ever claimed in the District of Columbia do I ask a\r\n     stronger, clearer charter than the Declaration of Independence,\r\n     and the constitution of the United States as it stood before the\r\n     fourteenth amendment had entered the minds of men. A judicial\r\n     decision, rendered by nine men, upon the rights of ten millions\r\n     of women of this republic, need not, does not, change the\r\n     convictions of one woman in regard to her own heaven-endowed\r\n     rights, duties, and responsibilities.\r\n\r\n     We have resorted to all the measures dictated by those who rule\r\n     over us for securing the freedom to exercise rights which are\r\n     sacredly our own, rights which are ours by Divine inheritance,\r\n     and which men can neither confer nor take away. We are not only\r\n     daughters of our Father in heaven, and joint heirs with you\r\n     there; but we are daughters of this republic, and joint heirs\r\n     with you here. Every act of legislation which has been placed as\r\n     a bar in our way as citizens has been an act of injustice, and\r\n     every expedient to which we have resorted for securing\r\n     recognition of citizenship has been with protest against the\r\n     existence of these acts of unauthorized power.\r\n\r\n     When any man expresses doubt to me as to the use that I or any\r\n     other woman might make of the ballot if we had it, my answer is,\r\n     What is that to you? If you have for years defrauded me of my\r\n     rightful inheritance, and then, as a stroke of policy, or from\r\n     late conviction, concluded to restore to me my own domain, must I\r\n     ask you whether I may make of it a garden of flowers, or a field\r\n     of wheat, or a pasture for kine? If I choose I may counsel with\r\n     you. If experience has given you wisdom, even of this world, in\r\n     managing your property and mine, I should be wise to learn from\r\n     you. But injustice is not wont to yield wisdom; grapes do not\r\n     grow of thorns, nor figs of thistles.\r\n\r\n     Born of the unjust and cruel subjection of woman to man, we have\r\n     in these United States a harvest of 116,000 paupers, 36,000\r\n     criminals, and such a mighty host of blind, deaf and dumb,\r\n     idiotic, insane, feeble-minded, and children with tendencies to\r\n     crime, as almost to lead one to hope for the extinction of the\r\n     human race rather than for its perpetuation after its own kind.\r\n     The wisdom of man licenses the dram-shop, and then rears\r\n     station-houses, jails, and gibbets to provide for the victims. In\r\n     this District we have 135 teachers of public schools and 238\r\n     police officers, and the last report shows that public safety\r\n     demands a police force of 900. We have 31,671 children of school\r\n     age; 31,671 reasons why I want to vote. We have here 7,000 more\r\n     children of school age than there are seats in all the public\r\n     schools, and from the swarm of poor, ignorant, and vagrant\r\n     children, the lists of criminals and paupers are constantly\r\n     supplied. To provide for these evils there is an annual\r\n     expenditure of $350,000, not including expenses of courts, while\r\n     for education the annual expenditure is $280,000.\r\n\r\n     Will you say that the wives and the mothers, the house and\r\n     homekeepers of this small territory, have no interest in all\r\n     these things? If dram-shops are licensed and brothels protected,\r\n     are not our sons, our brothers, tempted and ruined, our daughters\r\n     lured from their homes, and lost to earth and heaven? Long and\r\n     patiently women have borne wrongs too deep to be put into words;\r\n     wrongs for which men have provided no redress and have found no\r\n     remedy. When five years ago, with our social atmosphere poisoned\r\n     with vices which as women we had no power to remove, men in\r\n     authority began a series of attempts to fasten upon us by law the\r\n     huge typical vice of all the ages--the social evil--in a form so\r\n     degrading to all womanhood that no man, though he were the prince\r\n     of profligates, would submit to its regulations for a day; then\r\n     we cried out so that the world heard us. We know the plague is\r\n     only stayed for a brief while. The hydra-headed monster every now\r\n     and then lifts a new front, and must be smitten again. Four times\r\n     in four successive years a little company of women of the\r\n     District have appeared before committees and compelled the\r\n     discussion and defeat of bills designed to fasten these measures\r\n     upon the community under the guise of security for public health\r\n     and morality. The last annual report of the board of health\r\n     speaks tenderly of the need of protecting vicious men by these\r\n     regulations, and says:\r\n\r\n          The legalization of houses of ill-fame for so humane a\r\n          purpose, startling as it may be to the moral sense, has many\r\n          powerful advocates among the thoughtful, wise, and\r\n          philanthropic of communities.\r\n\r\n     The report quotes approvingly Dr. Gross, of Philadelphia, who\r\n     says in behalf of laws to license the social evil:\r\n\r\n          The prejudices which surround the subject must be swept\r\n          away, and men must march to the front and discharge their\r\n          duty, however much they may be reproached and abused by the\r\n          ignorant and foolish.\r\n\r\n     Aside from the higher ground of our inherent right to\r\n     self-government, we declare here and now that the women of this\r\n     District are not safe without the ballot. Our firesides, our\r\n     liberties are in constant peril, while men who have no concern\r\n     for our welfare may legislate against our dearest interests. If\r\n     we would inaugurate any measure of protection for our own sex, we\r\n     are bound hand and foot by man. The law is his, the treasury is\r\n     his, the power is his, and he need not even hear our cry, except\r\n     at his good will and pleasure.\r\n\r\n     If man had legislated justly and wisely for the interests of this\r\n     District, if its financial condition was sound, its social and\r\n     moral atmosphere pure, and all was well, there would be some show\r\n     of reason in your refusing to hazard a new experiment, even\r\n     though we could demonstrate it to be founded upon eternal\r\n     justice. But the history of the successive forms of government in\r\n     the District of Columbia is a history of failures. So will it\r\n     continue to be until you adopt a plan founded upon truly\r\n     republican principles. When, a few years ago, you put the ballot\r\n     into the hands of the swarming masses of freedmen who had\r\n     gathered here with the ignorance and vices of slaves, and refused\r\n     to enfranchise women, white or colored, you gave this District no\r\n     fair trial of a republican form of government. You did not even\r\n     protect the interests of the colored race. You admitted that the\r\n     colored man was not really free until he held the ballot in his\r\n     hand, and therefore you enfranchised him and left the woman twice\r\n     his slave. I know colored women in Washington far the superiors,\r\n     intellectually and morally, of the masses of men, who declare\r\n     that they now endure wrongs and abuses unknown in slavery.\r\n\r\n     There is not an interest in this District that is not as vital to\r\n     me as to any man in Washington--that is not more vital to me than\r\n     it can be to any member of this honorable body. As a citizen,\r\n     seeking the welfare of this community, as a wife and mother\r\n     desiring the safety of my children, which of you can claim a\r\n     deeper interest than I in questions of markets, taxes, finance,\r\n     banks, railroads, highways, the public debt and interest thereon,\r\n     boards of health, sanitary and police regulations, station-houses\r\n     (wherein I find many a wreck of womanhood, ruined in her youth\r\n     and beauty), schools, asylums, and charities? Why deny me a voice\r\n     in any or all of these? Do you doubt that I would use the ballot\r\n     in the interests of order, retrenchment, and reform? Do you deny\r\n     a right of mine, which you will admit I know how to prize,\r\n     because there are women who do not appreciate its value, do not\r\n     demand it, possibly might not (any better than men) know how to\r\n     use it? What a mockery of justice! What a flagrant violation of\r\n     individual rights! I would cry out against it if no other woman\r\n     in the land felt the wrong. But among the 10,000,000 of mothers\r\n     of 14,000,000 of children in this country, vast numbers of\r\n     thoughtful, philanthropic, and pure women have come to see this\r\n     truth, and desire to express their mother love and home love at\r\n     the ballot-box!\r\n\r\n     Frederick Douglass once said: \"Whole nations have been bathed in\r\n     blood to establish the simplest possible propositions. For\r\n     instance, that a man's head is _his_ head; his body is _his_\r\n     body; his feet are _his_ feet, and if he chooses to run away with\r\n     them it is nobody's business\"; and all honor to him, he added,\r\n     \"Now, these propositions have been established for the colored\r\n     man. Why does not man establish them for woman, his wife, his\r\n     mother?\"\r\n\r\n     Determined to surround the colored man with every possible\r\n     guarantee of protection in the possession of his freedom,\r\n     congress stopped the wheels of legislation, and made the whole\r\n     country wait, while day after day and night after night his\r\n     friends fought inch by inch the ground for the civil rights bill.\r\n     During that debate Senator Frelinghuysen said:\r\n\r\n          When I took the oath as senator, I took the oath to support\r\n          the Constitution of the United States, which declares\r\n          equality for all: and in advocating this bill I am doing my\r\n          sworn duty in endeavoring to secure equal rights for every\r\n          citizen of the United States.\r\n\r\n     But where slept his \"sworn duty\" when he recorded his vote in the\r\n     Senate against woman suffrage? With marvelous inconsistency, as a\r\n     reason for opposing woman suffrage, during the Pembina debate,\r\n     May 27, 1874, Senator Merrimon said of the relation of women to\r\n     the Constitution of the United States:\r\n\r\n          They have sustained it under all circumstances with their\r\n          love, their hands, and their hearts; with their smiles and\r\n          their tears they have educated their children to live for\r\n          it, and to die for it.\r\n\r\n     Therefore the honorable gentleman denies them the right to vote.\r\n\r\n     Upon the civil rights bill, Senator Howe said:\r\n\r\n          I do not know but what the passage of this bill will break\r\n          up the common schools. I admit that I have some fear on that\r\n          point. Every step of this terrible march has been met with a\r\n          threat; but let justice be done although the common schools\r\n          and the heavens do fall.\r\n\r\n     In reply to the point made by Mr. Stockton that the people of the\r\n     United States would not accept this bill, Mr. Howe said:\r\n\r\n          I would not turn back if I knew that of the forty million\r\n          people of the United States not one million would sustain\r\n          it. If this generation does not accept it there is a\r\n          generation to come that will accept it. What does this\r\n          provide? Not that the black man should be helped on his way;\r\n          not at all; but only that, as he staggers along, he shall\r\n          not be retarded, shall not be tripped up and made to fall.\r\n\r\n     Brave and tender words these for our black brother; but see how\r\n     prone men are to invert truth, justice, and mercy in dealing with\r\n     women. During the Pembina debate, Senator Merrimon said:\r\n\r\n          I know there are a few women in the country who complain;\r\n          but those who complain, compared with those who do not\r\n          complain, are as one to a million.\r\n\r\n     As a literal fact, the women who have complained, have\r\n     petitioned, sued, reasoned, plead, have knocked at the doors of\r\n     your legislatures and courts, are as one to fifty in this\r\n     country, as we who watch the record know; and even that is a\r\n     small proportion of those who would, but dare not; who are bound\r\n     hand and foot, and will be bound until you make them free. But if\r\n     no others feel the wrong but those who have dared to complain; if\r\n     the poor, the ignorant, the betrayed, the ruined do not\r\n     understand the question, and the well-fed and comfortable \"have\r\n     all the rights they want,\" do you give that for answer to our\r\n     just demand? What do we ask? Not that poor woman \"shall be helped\r\n     on her way\"--not at all; but only that, \"as she staggers along,\r\n     she shall not be retarded, shall not be tripped up, shall not be\r\n     made to fall.\"\r\n\r\n     And here on this national soil, for the women of this District of\r\n     Columbia--your peculiar wards--I ask you to try the experiment of\r\n     exact, even-handed justice; to give us a voice in the laws under\r\n     which we must live, by which we are tried, judged and condemned.\r\n     I ask it for myself, that I may the better help other women. I\r\n     ask it for other women, that they may the better help themselves.\r\n     As you hope for justice and mercy in your hour of need, may you\r\n     hear and answer.\r\n\r\nRev. Olympia Brown, of Connecticut; Belva A. Lockwood, of\r\nWashington; and Phoebe Couzins, of St. Louis, also addressed the\r\ncommittees; enforcing their arguments with wit, humor, pathos and\r\neloquence.\r\n\r\nOn her way home from Washington, Mrs. Gage stopped in Philadelphia\r\nto secure rooms for the National Association during the centennial\r\nsummer, and decided upon Carpenter Hall, in case it could be\r\nobtained. This hall belongs to the Carpenter Company of\r\nPhiladelphia, perhaps the oldest existing association of that city,\r\nit having maintained an uninterrupted organization from the year\r\n1724, about forty years after the establishment of the colonial\r\ngovernment by William Penn, and was much in use during the early\r\ndays of the revolution. The doors of the State House, where the\r\ncontinental congress intended to meet, were found closed against\r\nit; but the Carpenter Company, numbering many eminent patriots,\r\noffered its hall for their use; and here met the first continental\r\ncongress, September 5, 1774. John Adams, describing its opening\r\nceremonies, said:\r\n\r\n     Here was a scene worthy of the painter's art. Washington was\r\n     kneeling there, and Randolph, Rutledge, Lee and Jay; and by their\r\n     side there stood, bowed in reverence, the Puritan patriots of New\r\n     England, who at that moment had reason to believe that an armed\r\n     soldiery was wasting their humble households. It was believed\r\n     that Boston had been bombarded and destroyed.[3] They prayed\r\n     fervently for America, for the congress, for the province of\r\n     Massachusetts Bay, and especially for the town of Boston. Who can\r\n     realize the emotions with which in that hour of danger they\r\n     turned imploringly to heaven for Divine interposition. It was\r\n     enough to melt a heart of stone. I saw the tears gush into the\r\n     eyes of old, gray, pacific Quakers of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe action of this congress, which sat but seven weeks, was\r\nmomentous in the history of the world. \"From the moment of their\r\nfirst debate,\" said De Tocqueville, \"Europe was moved.\" The\r\nconvention which in 1781 framed the constitution of the United\r\nStates, also met in Carpenter Hall in secret session for four\r\nmonths before agreeing upon its provisions. This hall seemed the\r\nmost appropriate place for establishing the centennial rooms of the\r\nNational Woman Suffrage Association, but the effort to obtain\r\nit proved unavailing[4] as will be seen by the following\r\ncorrespondence:\r\n\r\n     _To the President and Officers of the Carpenter Company of\r\n     Philadelphia:_\r\n\r\n     The National Woman Suffrage Association will hold its\r\n     headquarters in Philadelphia the centennial season of 1876, and\r\n     desires to secure your historic hall for that purpose. We know\r\n     your habit and custom of denying its use to all societies, yet we\r\n     make our request because our objects are in accord with the\r\n     principles which emanated from within its walls a hundred years\r\n     ago, and we shall use it in carrying out those principles of\r\n     liberty and equality upon which our government is based.\r\n\r\n     We design to advertise our headquarters to the world, and old\r\n     Carpenter Hall, if used by us, would become more widely\r\n     celebrated as the birth-place of liberty. Our work in it would\r\n     cause it to be more than ever held in reverence by future ages,\r\n     and pilgrimages by men and women would be made to it as to\r\n     another Mecca shrine.\r\n\r\n     We propose to place a person in charge, with pamphlets, speeches,\r\n     tracts, etc., and to hold public meetings for the enunciation of\r\n     our principles and the furtherance of our demands. Hoping you\r\n     will grant this request,\r\n\r\n               I am respectfully yours,         MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE,\r\n               _President of the National Woman Suffrage Association._\r\n\r\nTwo months afterward, the following reply was received:\r\n\r\n                              HALL, CARPENTER COURT, 322 Chestnut St.,}\r\n                                         PHILADELPHIA, April 24, 1876.}\r\n\r\n     MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, _President of the Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association_:\r\n\r\n     Your communication asking permission to occupy Carpenter Hall for\r\n     your convention was duly received, and presented to the company\r\n     at a stated meeting held the 16th instant, when on motion it was\r\n     unanimously resolved to postpone the subject indefinitely.\r\n\r\n     [Extract of minutes].            GEORGE WATSON, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of no moment to those men that women were soon to\r\nassemble in Philadelphia, whose love of liberty was as deep, whose\r\npatriotism was as pure as that of the fathers who met within its\r\nwalls in 1774, and whose deliberations had given that hall its\r\nhistoric interest.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these preparations the usual May anniversary was\r\nheld:\r\n\r\n     CALL FOR THE MAY ANNIVERSARY, 1876.--The National Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association will hold its Ninth Annual Convention in Masonic\r\n     Hall, New York, corner of Sixth avenue and Twenty-third street,\r\n     May 10, 11, 1876.\r\n\r\n     This convention occuring in the centennial year of the republic,\r\n     will be a most important one. The underlying principles of\r\n     government will this year be discussed as never before; both\r\n     foreigners and citizens will query as to how closely this country\r\n     has lived up to its own principles. The long-debated question as\r\n     to the source of the governing power was answered a century ago\r\n     by the famous Declaration of Independence which shook to the\r\n     foundation all recognized power and proclaimed the right of the\r\n     individual as above all forms of government; but while thus\r\n     declaring itself, it has held the women of the nation accountable\r\n     to laws they have had no share in making, and taught as their one\r\n     duty, that doctrine of tyrants, unquestioning obedience. Liberty\r\n     to-day is, therefore, but the heritage of one-half the people,\r\n     and the centennial will be but the celebration of the\r\n     independence of one-half the nation. The men alone of this\r\n     country live in a republic, the women enter the second hundred\r\n     years of national life as political slaves.\r\n\r\n     That no structure is stronger than its weakest point is a law of\r\n     mechanics that will apply equally to government. In so far as\r\n     this government has denied justice to woman, it is weak, and\r\n     preparing for its own downfall. All the insurrections,\r\n     rebellions, and martyrdoms of history have grown out of the\r\n     desire for liberty, and in woman's heart this desire is as strong\r\n     as in man's. At every vital time in the nation's life, men and\r\n     women have worked together; everywhere has woman stood by the\r\n     side of father, brother, husband, son in defense of liberty;\r\n     without her aid the republic could never have been established;\r\n     and yet women are still suffering under all the oppressions\r\n     complained of in 1776; which can only be remedied by securing\r\n     impartial suffrage to all citizens without distinction of sex.\r\n\r\n     All persons who believe republican principles should be carried\r\n     out in spirit and in truth, are invited to be present at the May\r\n     convention.\r\n\r\n                                   MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, _President_.\r\n\r\n     SUSAN B. ANTHONY, _Chairman Executive Committee_.\r\n\r\nThis May anniversary, commencing on the same day with the opening\r\nof the centennial exhibition, was marked with more than usual\r\nearnestness. As popular thought naturally turned with increasing\r\ninterest at such an hour to the underlying principles of\r\ngovernment, woman's demand for political equality received a new\r\nimpulse. The famous Smith sisters, of Glastonbury, Connecticut,\r\nattended this convention, and were most cordially welcomed. The\r\nofficers[5] for the centennial year were chosen and a campaign[6]\r\nand congressional[7] committee appointed to take charge of affairs\r\nat Philadelphia and Washington. The resolutions show the general\r\ndrift of the discussions:[8]\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The right of self-government inheres in the individual\r\n     before governments are founded, constitutions framed, or courts\r\n     created; and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Governments exist to protect the people in the enjoyment\r\n     of their natural rights, and when any government becomes\r\n     destructive of this end, it is the right of the people to resist\r\n     and abolish it; and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The women of the United States, for one hundred years,\r\n     have been denied the exercise of their natural right of\r\n     self-government and self-protection; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is the natural right and most sacred duty of\r\n     the women of these United States to rebel against the injustice,\r\n     usurpation and tyranny of our present government.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The men of 1776 rebelled against a government which did\r\n     not claim to be of the people, but, on the contrary, upheld the\r\n     \"divine right of kings\"; and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The women of this nation to-day, under a government\r\n     which claims to be based upon individual rights, to be \"of the\r\n     people, by the people, and for the people,\" in an infinitely\r\n     greater degree are suffering all the wrongs which led to the war\r\n     of the revolution; and WHEREAS, The oppression is all the more\r\n     keenly felt because our masters, instead of dwelling in a foreign\r\n     land, are our husbands, our fathers, our brothers and our sons;\r\n     therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the women of this nation, in 1876, have greater\r\n     cause for discontent, rebellion and revolution, than the men of\r\n     1776.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That with Abigail Adams, in 1776, we believe that\r\n     \"the passion for liberty cannot be strong in the breasts of those\r\n     who are accustomed to deprive their fellow-creatures of liberty\";\r\n     that, as Abigail Adams predicted, \"We are determined to foment a\r\n     rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by laws in which we\r\n     have no voice or representation.\"\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, We believe in the principles of the Declaration of\r\n     Independence and of the Constitution of the United States, and\r\n     believe a true republic is the best form of government in the\r\n     world; and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, This government is false to its underlying principles in\r\n     denying to women the only means of self-government, the ballot;\r\n     and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, One-half of the citizens of this nation, after a century\r\n     of boasted liberty, are still political slaves; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we protest against calling the present\r\n     centennial celebration a celebration of the independence of the\r\n     people of the United States.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we meet in our respective towns and districts on\r\n     the Fourth of July, 1876, and declare ourselves no longer bound\r\n     to obey laws in whose making we have had no voice, and, in\r\n     presence of the assembled nations of the world gathered on this\r\n     soil to celebrate our nation's centennial, demand justice for the\r\n     women of this land.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The men of this nation have established for men of all\r\n     nations, races and color, on this soil, at the cost of countless\r\n     lives, the proposition (in the language of Frederick Douglass)\r\n     \"that a man's head is his head, his body is his body, his feet\r\n     are his feet\"; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That justice, equity and chivalry demand that man at\r\n     once establish for his wife and mother the corresponding\r\n     proposition, that a woman's head is her head, her body is her\r\n     body, her feet are her feet, and that all ownership and mastery\r\n     over her person, property, conscience, and liberty of speech and\r\n     action, are in violation of the supreme law of the land.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we rejoice in the resistance of Julia and Abby\r\n     Smith, Abby Kelly Foster, Sarah E. Wall and many more resolute\r\n     women in various parts of the country, to taxation without\r\n     representation.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the thanks of the National Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association are hereby tendered to Hon. A. A. Sargent, of\r\n     California, for his earnest words in behalf of woman suffrage on\r\n     the floor of the United States Senate, Jan. 25, 1876; and to Hon.\r\n     N. P. Banks, of Massachusetts, for his appeal in behalf of the\r\n     centennial woman suffrage memorial in the United States House of\r\n     Representatives, March 31, 1876.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the repeated attempts to license the social evil\r\n     are a practical confession of the weakness, profligacy and\r\n     general unfitness of men to legislate for women, and should be\r\n     regarded with alarm as a proof that their firesides and liberties\r\n     are in constant peril while men alone make and execute the laws\r\n     of this country.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, There are 7,000 more women than men in the District of\r\n     Columbia, and no form of government for said District has allowed\r\n     women any voice in making the laws under which they live;\r\n     therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That in this centennial year the congress of the\r\n     United States having exclusive jurisdiction over that territory\r\n     should establish a truly republican form of government by\r\n     granting equal suffrage to the men and women of the District of\r\n     Columbia.\r\n\r\nImmediately at the close of the May convention Mrs. Gage again went\r\nto Philadelphia to complete the arrangements in regard to the\r\ncentennial headquarters. Large and convenient rooms were soon\r\nfound upon Arch street, terms agreed upon and a lease drawn, when\r\nit transpired that a husband's consent and signature must be\r\nobtained, although the property was owned by a woman, as by the\r\nlaws of Pennsylvania a married woman's property is under her\r\nhusband's control. Although arrangements for this room had been\r\nmade with the real owner, the terms being perfectly satisfactory to\r\nher, the husband refused his ratification, tearing up the lease,\r\nwith abuse of the women who claimed control of their own property,\r\nand a general defiance of all women who dared work for the\r\nenfranchisement of their sex. Thus again were women refused rooms\r\nin Philadelphia in which to enter their protest against the tyranny\r\nof this republic, and for the same reason--they were slaves. Had\r\nthe patriots of the revolutionary period asked rooms of King\r\nGeorge, in which to foster their treason to his government, the\r\nrefusal could have been no more positive than in these cases.\r\n\r\nThe quarters finally obtained were very desirable; fine large\r\nparlors on the first floor, on Chestnut street, at the fashionable\r\nwest end, directly opposite the Young Men's Christian Association.\r\nThe other members of the committee being married ladies, Miss\r\nAnthony, as a _feme sole_, was alone held capable of making a\r\ncontract, and was therefore obliged to assume the pecuniary\r\nresponsibility of the rooms. Thus it is ever the married women who\r\nare more especially classed with lunatics, idiots and criminals,\r\nand held incapable of managing their own business. It has always\r\nbeen part of the code of slavery, that the slave had no right to\r\nproperty; all his earnings and gifts belonging by law, to the\r\nmaster. Married women come under this same civil code. The\r\nfollowing letter was extensively circulated and published in all\r\nthe leading journals:\r\n\r\n                         NATIONAL WOMAN SUFFRAGE PARLORS,            }\r\n                            1,431 Chestnut Street, PHILADELPHIA, PA. }\r\n\r\n     The National Woman Suffrage Association has established its\r\n     centennial headquarters in Philadelphia, at 1,431 Chestnut\r\n     street. The parlors, in charge of the officers of the\r\n     association, are devoted to the special work of the year,\r\n     pertaining to the centennial celebration and the political party\r\n     conventions; also to calls, receptions, conversazioni, etc. On\r\n     the table a centennial autograph book receives the names of\r\n     visitors. Friends at a distance, both men and women, who cannot\r\n     call, are invited to send their names, with date and residence,\r\n     accompanied by a short expressive sentiment and a contribution\r\n     toward expenses. In the rooms are books, papers, reports and\r\n     decisions, speeches, tracts, and photographs of distinguished\r\n     women; also mottoes and pictures expressive of woman's\r\n     condition. In addition to the parlor gatherings, meetings and\r\n     conventions will be held during the season in various halls and\r\n     churches throughout the city.\r\n\r\n     On July Fourth, while the men of this nation and the world are\r\n     rejoicing that \"All men are free and equal\" in the United States,\r\n     a declaration of rights for women will be issued from these\r\n     headquarters, and a protest against calling this centennial a\r\n     celebration of the independence of the people, while one-half are\r\n     still political slaves.\r\n\r\n     Let the women of the whole land, on that day, in meetings, in\r\n     parlors, in kitchens, wherever they may be, unite with us in this\r\n     declaration and protest. And, immediately thereafter, send full\r\n     reports, in manuscript or print, of their resolutions, speeches\r\n     and action, for record in our centennial book, that the world may\r\n     see that the women of 1876 know and feel their political\r\n     degradation no less than did the men of 1776.\r\n\r\n     The first woman's rights convention the world ever knew, called\r\n     by Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, met at Seneca Falls,\r\n     N. Y., July 19, 20, 1848. In commemoration of the twenty-eighth\r\n     anniversary of that event, the National Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association will hold in ---- hall, Philadelphia, July 19, 20, of\r\n     the present year, a grand mass convention, in which eminent\r\n     reformers from the new and old world will take part. Friends are\r\n     especially invited to be present on this historic occasion.\r\n\r\n                  MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, _Chairman Executive Committee_.\r\n\r\n     SUSAN B. ANTHONY, _Corresponding Secretary_.\r\n\r\nFrom these headquarters numberless documents were issued during the\r\nmonth of June. As the presidential nominating conventions were soon\r\nto meet, letters were addressed to both the Republican and\r\nDemocratic parties, urging them to recognize the political rights\r\nof women in their platforms. Thousands of copies of these letters\r\nwere scattered throughout the nation:\r\n\r\n     _To the President and Members of the National Republican\r\n     Convention, Cincinnati, O., June 14, 1876._\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN: The National Woman Suffrage Association asks you to\r\n     place in your platform the following plank:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the right to the use of the ballot inheres\r\n          in every citizen of the United States; and we pledge\r\n          ourselves to secure the exercise of this right to all\r\n          citizens, irrespective of sex.\r\n\r\n     In asking the insertion of this plank, we propose no change of\r\n     fundamental principles. Our question is as old as the nation. Our\r\n     government was framed on the political basis of the consent of\r\n     the governed. And from July 4, 1776, until the present year,\r\n     1876, the nation has constantly advanced toward a fuller practice\r\n     of our fundamental theory, that the governed are the source of\r\n     all power. Your nominating convention, occurring in this\r\n     centennial year of the republic, presents a good opportunity for\r\n     the complete recognition of these first principles. Our\r\n     government has not yet answered the end for which it was framed,\r\n     while one-half the people of the United States are deprived of\r\n     the right of self-government. Before the Revolution, Great\r\n     Britain claimed the right to legislate for the colonies in all\r\n     cases whatsoever; the men of this nation now as unjustly claim\r\n     the right to legislate for women in all cases whatsoever.\r\n\r\n     The call for your nominating convention invites the cooeperation\r\n     of \"all voters who desire to inaugurate and enforce the rights of\r\n     every citizen, including the full and free exercise of the right\r\n     of suffrage.\" Women are citizens; declared to be by the highest\r\n     legislative and judicial authorities; but they are citizens\r\n     deprived of \"the full and free exercise of the right of\r\n     suffrage.\" Your platform of 1872 declared \"the Republican party\r\n     mindful of its obligations to the loyal women of the nation for\r\n     their noble devotion to the cause of freedom.\" Devotion to\r\n     freedom is no new thing for the women of this nation. From the\r\n     earliest history of our country, woman has shown herself as\r\n     patriotic as man in every great emergency in the nation's life.\r\n     From the Revolution to the present hour, woman has stood by the\r\n     side of father, husband, son and brother in defense of liberty.\r\n     The heroic and self-sacrificing deeds of the women of this\r\n     republic, both in peace and war, must not be forgotten. Together\r\n     men and women have made this country what it is. And to-day, in\r\n     this one-hundredth year of our existence, the women--as members\r\n     of the nation--as citizens of the United States--ask national\r\n     recognition of their right of suffrage.\r\n\r\n     The Declaration of Independence struck a blow at every existent\r\n     form of government, by declaring the individual the source of all\r\n     power. Upon this one newly proclaimed truth our nation arose. But\r\n     if States may deny suffrage to any class of citizens, or confer\r\n     it at will upon any class--as according to the Minor-Happersett\r\n     decision of the Supreme Court--a decision rendered under the\r\n     auspices of the Republican party against suffrage as a\r\n     constituent element of United States citizenship--we then possess\r\n     no true national life. If States can deny suffrage to citizens of\r\n     the United States, then States possess more power than the United\r\n     States, and are more truly national in the character of their\r\n     governments. National supremacy does not chiefly mean power \"to\r\n     levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish\r\n     commerce\"; it means national protection and security in the\r\n     exercise of the right of self-government, which comes alone, by\r\n     and through the use of the ballot.\r\n\r\n     Even granting the premise of the Supreme-Court decision that \"the\r\n     Constitution of the United States does not confer suffrage on any\r\n     one\"; our national life does not date from that instrument. The\r\n     constitution is not the original declaration of rights. It was\r\n     not framed until eleven years after our existence as a nation,\r\n     nor fully ratified until nearly fourteen years after the\r\n     commencement of our national life. This centennial celebration of\r\n     our nation's birth does not date from the constitution, but from\r\n     the Declaration of Independence. The declared purpose of the\r\n     civil war was the settlement of the question of supremacy between\r\n     the States and the United States. The documents sent out by the\r\n     Republican party in this present campaign, warn the people that\r\n     the Democrats intend another battle for State sovereignty, to be\r\n     fought this year at the ballot-box.\r\n\r\n     The National Woman Suffrage Association calls your attention to\r\n     the fact that the Republican party has itself reopened this\r\n     battle, and now holds the anomalous position of having settled\r\n     the question of State sovereignty in the case of black men, and\r\n     again opened it, through the Minor-Happersett decision, not only\r\n     in the case of women citizens, but also in the case of men\r\n     citizens, for all other causes save those specified in the\r\n     fifteenth amendment. Your party has yet one opportunity to\r\n     retrieve its position. The political power of this country has\r\n     always shown itself superior to the judicial power--the latter\r\n     ever shaping and basing its decisions on the policy of the\r\n     dominant party. A pledge, therefore, by your convention to secure\r\n     national protection in the enjoyment of perfect equality of\r\n     rights, civil and political, to all citizens, will so define the\r\n     policy of the Republican party as to open the way to a full and\r\n     final adjustment of this question on the basis of United States\r\n     supremacy.\r\n\r\n     Aside from the higher motive of justice, we suggest your adoption\r\n     of this principle of equal rights to women, as a means of\r\n     securing your own future existence. The party of reform in this\r\n     country is the party that lives. The party that ceases to\r\n     represent the vital principles of truth and justice dies. If you\r\n     would save the life of the Republican party you should now take\r\n     broad national ground on this question of suffrage.\r\n\r\n     By this act you will do most to promote the general welfare,\r\n     secure the blessings of liberty to yourselves and your posterity,\r\n     and establish on this continent a genuine republic that shall\r\n     know no class, caste, race, or sex--where all the people are\r\n     citizens, and all citizens are equal before the law.\r\n\r\n                  MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, _Chairman Executive Committee_.\r\n\r\n     SUSAN B. ANTHONY, _Corresponding Secretary_.\r\n     _Centennial Headquarters_,\r\n        1,431 Chestnut street, _Philadelphia_, June 10, 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _To the President and Members of the National Democratic\r\n     Convention assembled at St. Louis, June 27, 1876_:\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN: In reading the call for your convention, the National\r\n     Woman Suffrage Association was gratified to find that your\r\n     invitation was not limited to voters, but cordially extended to\r\n     all citizens of the United States. We accordingly send delegates\r\n     from our association, asking for them a voice in your\r\n     proceedings, and also a plank in your platform declaring the\r\n     political rights of women.\r\n\r\n     Women are the only class of citizens still wholly unrepresented\r\n     in the government, and yet we possess every qualification\r\n     requisite for voters in the several States. Women possess\r\n     property and education; we take out naturalization papers and\r\n     passports; we preempt lands, pay taxes, and suffer for our own\r\n     violation of the laws. We are neither idiots, lunatics, nor\r\n     criminals; and, according to your State constitutions, lack but\r\n     one qualification for voters, namely, sex, which is an\r\n     insurmountable qualification, and therefore equivalent to a bill\r\n     of attainder against one-half the people; a power no State nor\r\n     congress can legally exercise, being forbidden in article 1,\r\n     sections 9, 10, of our constitution. Our rulers may have the\r\n     right to regulate the suffrage, but they can not abolish it\r\n     altogether for any class of citizens, as has been done in the\r\n     case of the women of this republic, without a direct violation of\r\n     the fundamental law of the land.\r\n\r\n     As you hold the constitution of the fathers to be a sacred legacy\r\n     to us and our children forever, we ask you to so interpret that\r\n     _Magna Charta_ of human rights as to secure justice and equality\r\n     to all United States citizens irrespective of sex. We desire to\r\n     call your attention to the violation of the essential principle\r\n     of self-government in the disfranchisement of the women of the\r\n     several States, and we appeal to you, not only because as a\r\n     minority you are in a position to consider principles, but\r\n     because you were the party first to extend suffrage by removing\r\n     the property qualification from all white men, and thus making\r\n     the political status of the richest and poorest citizen the same.\r\n     That act of justice to the laboring masses insured your power,\r\n     with but few interruptions, until the war.\r\n\r\n     When the District of Columbia suffrage bill was under discussion\r\n     in 1866, it was a Democratic senator (Mr. Cowan, of Pennsylvania)\r\n     who proposed an amendment to strike out the word \"male,\" and thus\r\n     extend the right of suffrage to the women, as well as the black\r\n     men of the District. That amendment gave us a splendid discussion\r\n     on woman suffrage that lasted three days in the Senate of the\r\n     United States. It was a Democratic legislature that secured the\r\n     right of suffrage to the women of Wyoming, and we now ask you in\r\n     national convention to pledge the Democratic party to extend this\r\n     act of justice to the women throughout the nation, and thus call\r\n     to your side a new political force that will restore and\r\n     perpetuate your power for years to come.\r\n\r\n     The Republican party gave us a plank in their platform in 1872,\r\n     pledging themselves to a \"respectful consideration\" of our\r\n     demands. But by their constitutional interpretations, legislative\r\n     enactments, and judicial decisions, so far from redeeming their\r\n     pledge, they have buried our petitions and appeals under laws in\r\n     direct opposition to their high-sounding promises and\r\n     professions. And now (1876) they give us another plank in their\r\n     platform, approving the \"substantial advance made toward the\r\n     establishment of equal rights for women\"; cunningly reminding us\r\n     that the privileges and immunities we now enjoy are all due to\r\n     Republican legislation--although, under a Republican dynasty,\r\n     inspectors of election have been arrested and imprisoned for\r\n     taking the votes of women; temperance women arrested and\r\n     imprisoned for praying in the streets; houses, lands, bonds, and\r\n     stock of women seized and sold for their refusal to pay unjust\r\n     taxation--and, more than all, we have this singular spectacle: a\r\n     Republican woman, who had spoken for the Republican party\r\n     throughout the last presidential campaign, arrested by Republican\r\n     officers for voting the Republican ticket, denied the right of\r\n     trial by jury by a Republican judge, convicted and sentenced to a\r\n     fine of one hundred dollars and costs of prosecution; and all\r\n     this for asserting at the polls the most sacred of all the rights\r\n     of American citizenship--the right of suffrage--specifically\r\n     secured by recent Republican amendments to the federal\r\n     constitution.\r\n\r\n     Again, the Supreme Court of the United States, by its recent\r\n     decision in the Minor-Happersett case, has stultified its own\r\n     interpretation of constitutional law. A negro, by virtue of his\r\n     United States citizenship, is declared under recent amendments a\r\n     voter in every State in the Union; but when a woman, by virtue of\r\n     her United States citizenship, applies to the Supreme Court for\r\n     protection in the exercise of this same right, she is remanded to\r\n     the State by the unanimous decision of the nine judges on the\r\n     bench, that \"the Constitution of the United States does not\r\n     confer the right of suffrage upon any one.\"\r\n\r\n     All concessions of privileges or redress of grievances are but\r\n     mockery for any class that has no voice in the laws and\r\n     lawmakers. Hence we demand the ballot--that scepter of power--in\r\n     our own hands, as the only sure protection for our rights of\r\n     person and property under all conditions. If the few may grant or\r\n     withhold rights at their own pleasure, the many cannot be said to\r\n     enjoy the blessings of self-government. Jefferson said, \"The God\r\n     who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time. The hand of\r\n     force may destroy, but cannot disjoin them.\" While the first and\r\n     highest motive we would urge on you is the recognition in all\r\n     your action of the great principles of justice and equality that\r\n     underlie our form of government, it is not unworthy to remind you\r\n     that the party that takes this onward step will reap its just\r\n     reward.\r\n\r\n     Had you heeded our appeals made to you in Tammany Hall, New York,\r\n     in 1868, and again in Baltimore, in 1872, your party might now\r\n     have been in power, as you would have had, what neither party can\r\n     boast to-day, a live issue on which to rouse the enthusiasm of\r\n     the people. Reform is the watchword of the hour; but how can we\r\n     hope for honor and honesty in either party in minor matters, so\r\n     long as both consent to rob one-half the people--their own\r\n     mothers, sisters, wives and daughters--of their most sacred\r\n     rights? As a party you defended the right of self-government in\r\n     Louisiana ably and eloquently during the last session of\r\n     congress. Are the rights of women in all the Southern States,\r\n     whose slaves are now their rulers, less sacred than those of the\r\n     men of Louisiana? \"The whole art of government,\" says Jefferson,\r\n     \"consists in being honest.\"\r\n\r\n     It needs but little observation to see that the tide of progress,\r\n     in all countries, is setting toward the emancipation and\r\n     enfranchisement of women; and this step in civilization is to be\r\n     taken in our day and generation. Whether the Democratic party\r\n     will take the initiative in this reform, and reap the glory of\r\n     crowning fifteen million women with the rights of American\r\n     citizenship, and thereby vindicate our theory of self-government,\r\n     is the momentous question we ask you to decide in this eventful\r\n     hour, as we round out the first century of our national life.\r\n\r\n                                  ELIZABETH CADY STANTON, _President_.\r\n\r\n     MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, _Chairman Executive Committee_.\r\n     SUSAN B. ANTHONY, _Corresponding Secretary_.\r\n     _Centennial Headquarters_,\r\n         1,431 Chestnut street, _Philadelphia_, June 20, 1876.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these letters delegates were sent to both the\r\nRepublican and Democratic conventions. Sara Andrews Spencer and\r\nElizabeth Boynton Harbert were present at the Republican convention\r\nat Cincinnati; both addressed the committee on platform and\r\nresolutions, and Mrs. Spencer, on motion of Hon. George F. Hoar,\r\nwas permitted to address the convention. Mrs. Virginia L. Minor and\r\nMiss Phoebe W. Couzins were the delegates to the Democratic\r\nconvention at St. Louis, and the latter addressed that vast\r\nassembly.[9]\r\n\r\nFor a long time there had been a growing demand for a woman's\r\ndeclaration to be issued on July Fourth, 1876. \"Let us then protest\r\nagainst the falsehood of the nation\"; \"If the old Declaration does\r\nnot include women, let us have one that will\"; \"Let our rulers be\r\narraigned\"; \"A declaration of independence for women must be issued\r\non the Fourth of July, 1876,\" were demands that came from all parts\r\nof the country. The officers of the association had long had such\r\naction in view, having, at the Washington convention, early in\r\n1875, announced their intention of working in Philadelphia during\r\nthe centennial season, and were strengthened in their determination\r\nby the hearty indorsement they received. At the May convention in\r\nNew York, Matilda Joslyn Gage, in her opening speech, announced\r\nthat a declaration of independence for women would be issued on the\r\nFourth of July, 1876. In response to this general feeling, the\r\nofficers of the National Association prepared a declaration of\r\nrights of the women of the United States, and articles of\r\nimpeachment against the government.\r\n\r\nApplication was made by the secretary, Miss Anthony, to General\r\nHawley, president of the centennial commission, for seats for fifty\r\nofficers of the association. General Hawley replied that \"only\r\nofficials were invited\"--that even his own wife had no place--that\r\nmerely representatives and officers of the government had seats\r\nassigned them. \"Then\" said she, \"as women have no share in the\r\ngovernment, they are to have no seats on the platform,\" to which\r\nGeneral Hawley assented; adding, however, that Mrs. Gillespie, of\r\nthe woman's centennial commission, had fifty seats placed at her\r\ndisposal, thus showing it to be in his power to grant places to\r\nwomen whenever he so chose to do. Miss Anthony said: \"I ask seats\r\nfor the officers of the National Woman Suffrage Association; we\r\nrepresent one-half the people, and why should we be denied all part\r\nin this centennial celebration?\" Miss Anthony, however, secured a\r\nreporter's ticket by virtue of representing her brother's paper,\r\n_The Leavenworth Times_, and, ultimately, cards of invitation were\r\nsent to four others,[10] representing the 20,000,000 disfranchised\r\ncitizens of the nation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton, as president of the association, wrote General\r\nHawley, asking the opportunity to present the woman's protest and\r\nbill of rights at the close of the reading of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. Just its simple presentation and nothing more. She\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n     We do not ask to read our declaration, only to present it to the\r\n     president of the United States, that it may become an historical\r\n     part of the proceedings.\r\n\r\nMrs. Spencer, bearer of this letter, in presenting it to General\r\nHawley, said:\r\n\r\n     The women of the United States make a slight request on the\r\n     occasion of the centennial celebration of the birth of the\r\n     nation; we only ask that we may silently present our declaration\r\n     of rights.\r\n\r\n     General HAWLEY replied: It seems a very slight request, but our\r\n     programme is published, our speakers engaged, our arrangements\r\n     for the day decided upon, and we can not make even so slight a\r\n     change as that you ask.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. SPENCER replied: We are aware that your programme is\r\n     published, your speakers engaged, your entire arrangements\r\n     decided upon, without consulting with the women of the United\r\n     States; for that very reason we desire to enter our protest. We\r\n     are aware that this government has been conducted for one hundred\r\n     years without consulting the women of the United States; for this\r\n     reason we desire to enter our protest.\r\n\r\n     General HAWLEY replied: Undoubtedly we have not lived up to our\r\n     own original Declaration of Independence in many respects. I\r\n     express no opinion upon your question. It is a proper subject of\r\n     discussion at the Cincinnati convention, at the St. Louis\r\n     convention,, in the Senate of the United States, in the State\r\n     legislatures, in the courts, wherever you can obtain a hearing.\r\n     But to-morrow we propose to celebrate what we have done the last\r\n     hundred years; not what we have failed to do. We have much to do\r\n     in the future. I understand the full significance of your very\r\n     slight request. If granted, it would be the event of the day--the\r\n     topic of discussion to the exclusion of all others. I am sorry to\r\n     refuse so slight a demand; we cannot grant it.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hawley also addressed a letter to Mrs. Stanton:\r\n\r\n     DEAR MADAM: I regret to say it is impossible for us to make any\r\n     change in our programme, or make any addition to it at this late\r\n     hour.\r\n\r\n                    Yours very respectfully,\r\n                          JOS. R. HAWLEY, _President U. S. C. C._\r\n\r\nAs General Grant was not to attend the celebration, the acting\r\nvice-president, Thomas W. Ferry, representing the government, was\r\nto officiate in his place, and he, too, was addressed by note, and\r\ncourteously requested to make time for the reception of this\r\ndeclaration. As Mr. Ferry was a well-known sympathizer with the\r\ndemands of woman for political rights, it was presumable that he\r\nwould render his aid. Yet he was forgetful that in his position\r\nthat day he represented, not the exposition, but the government of\r\na hundred years, and he too refused; thus this simple request of\r\nwoman for a half moment's recognition on the nation's centennial\r\nbirthday was denied by all in authority.[11] While the women of\r\nthe nation were thus absolutely forbidden the right of public\r\nprotest, lavish preparations were made for the reception and\r\nentertainment of foreign potentates and the myrmidons of monarchial\r\ninstitutions. Dom Pedro, emperor of Brazil, a representative of\r\nthat form of government against which the United States is a\r\nperpetual defiance and protest, was welcomed with fulsome\r\nadulation, and given a seat of honor near the officers of the day;\r\nPrince Oscar of Sweden, a stripling of sixteen, on whose shoulder\r\nrests the promise of a future kingship, was seated near. Count\r\nRochambeau of France, the Japanese commissioners, high officials\r\nfrom Russia and Prussia, from Austria, Spain, England, Turkey,\r\nrepresenting the barbarism and semi-civilization of the day, found\r\nno difficulty in securing recognition and places of honor upon that\r\nplatform, where representative womanhood was denied.\r\n\r\nThough refused by their own countrymen a place and part in the\r\ncentennial celebration, the women who had taken this presentation\r\nin hand were not to be conquered. They had respectfully asked for\r\nrecognition; now that it had been denied, they determined to seize\r\nupon the moment when the reading of the Declaration of Independence\r\nclosed, to proclaim to the world the tyranny and injustice of the\r\nnation toward one-half its people. Five officers of the National\r\nWoman Suffrage Association, with that heroic spirit which has ever\r\nanimated lovers of liberty in resistance to tyranny, determined,\r\nwhatever the result, to present the woman's declaration of rights\r\nat the chosen hour. They would not, they dared not sacrifice the\r\ngolden opportunity to which they had so long looked forward; their\r\nwork was not for themselves alone, nor for the present generation,\r\nbut for all women of all time. The hopes of posterity were in their\r\nhands and they determined to place on record for the daughters of\r\n1976, the fact that their mothers of 1876 had asserted their\r\nequality of rights, and impeached the government of that day for\r\nits injustice toward woman. Thus, in taking a grander step toward\r\nfreedom than ever before, they would leave one bright remembrance\r\nfor the women of the next centennial.\r\n\r\nThat historic Fourth of July dawned at last, one of the most\r\noppressive days of that terribly heated season. Susan B. Anthony,\r\nMatilda Joslyn Gage, Sara Andrews Spencer, Lillie Devereux Blake\r\nand Phoebe W. Couzins made their way through the crowds under the\r\nbroiling sun to Independence Square, carrying the Woman's\r\nDeclaration of Rights. This declaration had been handsomely\r\nengrossed by one of their number, and signed by the oldest and most\r\nprominent advocates of woman's enfranchisement. Their tickets of\r\nadmission proved open sesame through the military and all other\r\nbarriers, and a few moments before the opening of the ceremonies,\r\nthese women found themselves within the precincts from which most\r\nof their sex were excluded.\r\n\r\nThe declaration of 1776 was read by Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia,\r\nabout whose family clusters so much of historic fame. The close of\r\nhis reading was deemed the appropriate moment for the presentation\r\nof the woman's declaration. Not quite sure how their approach might\r\nbe met--not quite certain if at this final moment they would be\r\npermitted to reach the presiding officer--those ladies arose and\r\nmade their way down the aisle. The bustle of preparation for the\r\nBrazilian hymn covered their advance. The foreign guests, the\r\nmilitary and civil officers who filled the space directly in front\r\nof the speaker's stand, courteously made way, while Miss Anthony in\r\nfitting words presented the declaration. Mr. Ferry's face paled, as\r\nbowing low, with no word, he received the declaration, which thus\r\nbecame part of the day's proceedings; the ladies turned, scattering\r\nprinted copies, as they deliberately walked down the platform. On\r\nevery side eager hands were stretched; men stood on seats and asked\r\nfor them, while General Hawley, thus defied and beaten in his\r\naudacious denial to women the right to present their declaration,\r\nshouted, \"Order, order!\"\r\n\r\nPassing out, these ladies made their way to a platform erected for\r\nthe musicians in front of Independence Hall. Here on this old\r\nhistoric ground, under the shadow of Washington's statue, back of\r\nthem the old bell that proclaimed \"liberty to all the land, and all\r\nthe inhabitants thereof,\" they took their places, and to a\r\nlistening, applauding crowd, Miss Anthony read[12] the Declaration\r\nof Rights for Women by the National Woman Suffrage Association,\r\nJuly 4, 1876:\r\n\r\n     While the nation is buoyant with patriotism, and all hearts are\r\n     attuned to praise, it is with sorrow we come to strike the one\r\n     discordant note, on this one-hundredth anniversary of our\r\n     country's birth. When subjects of kings, emperors, and czars,\r\n     from the old world join in our national jubilee, shall the women\r\n     of the republic refuse to lay their hands with benedictions on\r\n     the nation's head? Surveying America's exposition, surpassing in\r\n     magnificence those of London, Paris, and Vienna, shall we not\r\n     rejoice at the success of the youngest rival among the nations of\r\n     the earth? May not our hearts, in unison with all, swell with\r\n     pride at our great achievements as a people; our free speech,\r\n     free press, free schools, free church, and the rapid progress we\r\n     have made in material wealth, trade, commerce and the inventive\r\n     arts? And we do rejoice in the success, thus far, of our\r\n     experiment of self-government. Our faith is firm and unwavering\r\n     in the broad principles of human rights proclaimed in 1776, not\r\n     only as abstract truths, but as the corner stones of a republic.\r\n     Yet we cannot forget, even in this glad hour, that while all men\r\n     of every race, and clime, and condition, have been invested with\r\n     the full rights of citizenship under our hospitable flag, all\r\n     women still suffer the degradation of disfranchisement.\r\n\r\n     The history of our country the past hundred years has been a\r\n     series of assumptions and usurpations of power over woman, in\r\n     direct opposition to the principles of just government,\r\n     acknowledged by the United States as its foundation, which are:\r\n\r\n     _First_--The natural rights of each individual.\r\n\r\n     _Second_--The equality of these rights.\r\n\r\n     _Third_--That rights not delegated are retained by the\r\n     individual.\r\n\r\n     _Fourth_--That no person can exercise the rights of others\r\n     without delegated authority.\r\n\r\n     _Fifth_--That the non-use of rights does not destroy them.\r\n\r\n     And for the violation of these fundamental principles of our\r\n     government, we arraign our rulers on this Fourth day of July,\r\n     1876,--and these are our articles of impeachment:\r\n\r\n          _Bills of attainder_ have been passed by the introduction of\r\n          the word \"male\" into all the State constitutions, denying to\r\n          women the right of suffrage, and thereby making sex a\r\n          crime--an exercise of power clearly forbidden in article I,\r\n          sections 9, 10, of the United States constitution.\r\n\r\n          _The writ of habeas corpus_, the only protection against\r\n          _lettres de cachet_ and all forms of unjust imprisonment,\r\n          which the constitution declares \"shall not be suspended,\r\n          except when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public\r\n          safety demands it,\" is held inoperative in every State of\r\n          the Union, in case of a married woman against her\r\n          husband--the marital rights of the husband being in all\r\n          cases primary, and the rights of the wife secondary.\r\n\r\n          _The right of trial by a jury of one's peers_ was so\r\n          jealously guarded that States refused to ratify the original\r\n          constitution until it was guaranteed by the sixth amendment.\r\n          And yet the women of this nation have never been allowed a\r\n          jury of their peers--being tried in all cases by men, native\r\n          and foreign, educated and ignorant, virtuous and vicious.\r\n          Young girls have been arraigned in our courts for the crime\r\n          of infanticide; tried, convicted, hanged--victims,\r\n          perchance, of judge, jurors, advocates--while no woman's\r\n          voice could be heard in their defense. And not only are\r\n          women denied a jury of their peers, but in some cases, jury\r\n          trial altogether. During the war, a woman was tried and\r\n          hanged by military law, in defiance of the fifth amendment,\r\n          which specifically declares: \"No person shall be held to\r\n          answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on\r\n          a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases\r\n          ... of persons in actual service in time of war.\" During the\r\n          last presidential campaign, a woman, arrested for voting,\r\n          was denied the protection of a jury, tried, convicted, and\r\n          sentenced to a fine and costs of prosecution, by the\r\n          absolute power of a judge of the Supreme Court of the United\r\n          States.\r\n\r\n          _Taxation without representation_, the immediate cause of\r\n          the rebellion of the colonies against Great Britain, is one\r\n          of the grievous wrongs the women of this country have\r\n          suffered during the century. Deploring war, with all the\r\n          demoralization that follows in its train, we have been taxed\r\n          to support standing armies, with their waste of life and\r\n          wealth. Believing in temperance, we have been taxed to\r\n          support the vice, crime and pauperism of the liquor traffic.\r\n          While we suffer its wrongs and abuses infinitely more than\r\n          man, we have no power to protect our sons against this giant\r\n          evil. During the temperance crusade, mothers were arrested,\r\n          fined, imprisoned, for even praying and singing in the\r\n          streets, while men blockade the sidewalks with impunity,\r\n          even on Sunday, with their military parades and political\r\n          processions. Believing in honesty, we are taxed to support a\r\n          dangerous army of civilians, buying and selling the offices\r\n          of government and sacrificing the best interests of the\r\n          people. And, moreover, we are taxed to support the very\r\n          legislators and judges who make laws, and render decisions\r\n          adverse to woman. And for refusing to pay such unjust\r\n          taxation, the houses, lands, bonds, and stock of women have\r\n          been seized and sold within the present year, thus proving\r\n          Lord Coke's assertion, that \"The very act of taxing a man's\r\n          property without his consent is, in effect, disfranchising\r\n          him of every civil right.\"\r\n\r\n          _Unequal codes for men and women._ Held by law a perpetual\r\n          minor, deemed incapable of self-protection, even in the\r\n          industries of the world, woman is denied equality of rights.\r\n          The fact of sex, not the quantity or quality of work, in\r\n          most cases, decides the pay and position; and because of\r\n          this injustice thousands of fatherless girls are compelled\r\n          to choose between a life of shame and starvation. Laws\r\n          catering to man's vices have created two codes of morals in\r\n          which penalties are graded according to the political status\r\n          of the offender. Under such laws, women are fined and\r\n          imprisoned if found alone in the streets, or in public\r\n          places of resort, at certain hours. Under the pretense of\r\n          regulating public morals, police officers seizing the\r\n          occupants of disreputable houses, march the women in\r\n          platoons to prison, while the men, partners in their guilt,\r\n          go free. While making a show of virtue in forbidding the\r\n          importation of Chinese women on the Pacific coast for\r\n          immoral purposes, our rulers, in many States, and even under\r\n          the shadow of the national capitol, are now proposing to\r\n          legalize the sale of American womanhood for the same vile\r\n          purposes.\r\n\r\n          _Special legislation for woman_ has placed us in a most\r\n          anomalous position. Women invested with the rights of\r\n          citizens in one section--voters, jurors,\r\n          office-holders--crossing an imaginary line, are subjects in\r\n          the next. In some States, a married woman may hold property\r\n          and transact business in her own name; in others, her\r\n          earnings belong to her husband. In some States, a woman may\r\n          testify against her husband, sue and be sued in the courts;\r\n          in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person,\r\n          property, or character. In case of divorce on account of\r\n          adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to\r\n          possess no right to children or property, unless by special\r\n          decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the\r\n          wife the right to her own person, or to any part of the\r\n          joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her\r\n          husband. In some States women may enter the law schools and\r\n          practice in the courts; in others they are forbidden. In\r\n          some universities girls enjoy equal educational advantages\r\n          with boys, while many of the proudest institutions in the\r\n          land deny them admittance, though the sons of China, Japan\r\n          and Africa are welcomed there. But the privileges already\r\n          granted in the several States are by no means secure. The\r\n          right of suffrage once exercised by women in certain States\r\n          and territories has been denied by subsequent legislation. A\r\n          bill is now pending in congress to disfranchise the women of\r\n          Utah, thus interfering to deprive United States citizens of\r\n          the same rights which the Supreme Court has declared the\r\n          national government powerless to protect anywhere. Laws\r\n          passed after years of untiring effort, guaranteeing married\r\n          women certain rights of property, and mothers the custody of\r\n          their children, have been repealed in States where we\r\n          supposed all was safe. Thus have our most sacred rights been\r\n          made the football of legislative caprice, proving that a\r\n          power which grants as a privilege what by nature is a right,\r\n          may withhold the same as a penalty when deeming it necessary\r\n          for its own perpetuation.\r\n\r\n          _Representation of woman_ has had no place in the nation's\r\n          thought. Since the incorporation of the thirteen original\r\n          States, twenty-four have been admitted to the Union, not one\r\n          of which has recognized woman's right of self-government. On\r\n          this birthday of our national liberties, July Fourth, 1876,\r\n          Colorado, like all her elder sisters, comes into the Union\r\n          with the invidious word \"male\" in her constitution.\r\n\r\n          _Universal manhood suffrage_, by establishing an aristocracy\r\n          of sex, imposes upon the women of this nation a more\r\n          absolute and cruel depotism than monarchy; in that, woman\r\n          finds a political master in her father, husband, brother,\r\n          son. The aristocracies of the old world are based upon\r\n          birth, wealth, refinement, education, nobility, brave deeds\r\n          of chivalry; in this nation, on sex alone; exalting brute\r\n          force above moral power, vice above virtue, ignorance above\r\n          education, and the son above the mother who bore him.\r\n\r\n          _The judiciary above the nation_ has proved itself but the\r\n          echo of the party in power, by upholding and enforcing laws\r\n          that are opposed to the spirit and letter of the\r\n          constitution. When the slave power was dominant, the Supreme\r\n          Court decided that a black man was not a citizen, because he\r\n          had not the right to vote; and when the constitution was so\r\n          amended as to make all persons citizens, the same high\r\n          tribunal decided that a woman, though a citizen, had not the\r\n          right to vote. Such vacillating interpretations of\r\n          constitutional law unsettle our faith in judicial authority,\r\n          and undermine the liberties of the whole people.\r\n\r\n     These articles of impeachment against our rulers we now submit to\r\n     the impartial judgment of the people. To all these wrongs and\r\n     oppressions woman has not submitted in silence and resignation.\r\n     From the beginning of the century, when Abigail Adams, the wife\r\n     of one president and mother of another, said, \"We will not hold\r\n     ourselves bound to obey laws in which we have no voice or\r\n     representation,\" until now, woman's discontent has been steadily\r\n     increasing, culminating nearly thirty years ago in a simultaneous\r\n     movement among the women of the nation, demanding the right of\r\n     suffrage. In making our just demands, a higher motive than the\r\n     pride of sex inspires us; we feel that national safety and\r\n     stability depend on the complete recognition of the broad\r\n     principles of our government. Woman's degraded, helpless position\r\n     is the weak point in our institutions to-day; a disturbing force\r\n     everywhere, severing family ties, filling our asylums with the\r\n     deaf, the dumb, the blind; our prisons with criminals, our cities\r\n     with drunkenness and prostitution; our homes with disease and\r\n     death. It was the boast of the founders of the republic, that the\r\n     rights for which they contended were the rights of human nature.\r\n     If these rights are ignored in the case of one-half the people,\r\n     the nation is surely preparing for its downfall. Governments try\r\n     themselves. The recognition of a governing and a governed class\r\n     is incompatible with the first principles of freedom. Woman has\r\n     not been a heedless spectator of the events of this century, nor\r\n     a dull listener to the grand arguments for the equal rights of\r\n     humanity. From the earliest history of our country woman has\r\n     shown equal devotion with man to the cause of freedom, and has\r\n     stood firmly by his side in its defense. Together, they have made\r\n     this country what it is. Woman's wealth, thought and labor have\r\n     cemented the stones of every monument man has reared to liberty.\r\n\r\n     And now, at the close of a hundred years, as the hour-hand of the\r\n     great clock that marks the centuries points to 1876, we declare\r\n     our faith in the principles of self-government; our full equality\r\n     with man in natural rights; that woman was made first for her own\r\n     happiness, with the absolute right to herself--to all the\r\n     opportunities and advantages life affords for her complete\r\n     development; and we deny that dogma of the centuries,\r\n     incorporated in the codes of all nations--that woman was made for\r\n     man--her best interests, in all cases, to be sacrificed to his\r\n     will. We ask of our rulers, at this hour, no special favors, no\r\n     special privileges, no special legislation. We ask justice, we\r\n     ask equality, we ask that all the civil and political rights that\r\n     belong to citizens of the United States, be guaranteed to us and\r\n     our daughters forever.[13]\r\n\r\nThe declaration was warmly applauded at many points, and after\r\nscattering another large number of printed copies, the delegation\r\nhastened to the convention of the National Association. A meeting\r\nhad been appointed for twelve, in the old historic First Unitarian\r\nchurch, where Rev. Wm. H. Furness preached for fifty years, but\r\nwhose pulpit was then filled by Joseph May, a son of Rev. Samuel J.\r\nMay. To this place the ladies made their way to find the church\r\ncrowded with an expectant audience, which greeted them with thanks\r\nfor what they had just done; the first act of this historic day\r\ntaking place on the old centennial platform in Independence Square,\r\nthe last in a church so long devoted to equality and justice. The\r\nvenerable Lucretia Mott, then in her eighty-fourth year, presided.\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton read the Declaration of Rights. Its\r\nreception by the listening audience proclaimed its need and its\r\njustice. The reading was followed by speeches upon the various\r\npoints of the declaration.\r\n\r\nBelva A. Lockwood took up the judiciary, showing the way that body\r\nlends itself to party politics. Matilda Joslyn Gage spoke upon the\r\nwrit of _habeas corpus_, showing what a mockery to married women\r\nwas that constitutional guarantee. Lucretia Mott reviewed the\r\nprogress of the reform from the first convention. Sara Andrews\r\nSpencer illustrated the evils arising from two codes of morality.\r\nMrs. Devereux Blake spoke upon trial by jury; Susan B. Anthony upon\r\ntaxation without representation, illustrating her remarks by\r\nincidents of unjust taxation of women during the present year.\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton spoke upon the aristocracy of sex, and the\r\nevils arising from manhood suffrage. Judge Esther Morris, of\r\nWyoming, said a few words in regard to suffrage in that territory.\r\nMrs. Margaret Parker, president of the woman suffrage club of\r\nDundee, Scotland, and of the newly-formed Christian Woman's\r\nInternational Temperance Union, said she had seen nothing like this\r\nin Great Britain--it was worth the journey across the Atlantic. Mr.\r\nJ. H. Raper, of Manchester, England, characterized it as the\r\nhistoric meeting of the day, and said the patriot of a hundred\r\nyears hence would seek for every incident connected with it, and\r\nthe next centennial would be adorned by the portraits of the women\r\nwho sat upon that platform.\r\n\r\nThe Hutchinsons, themselves of historic fame, were present. They\r\nwere in their happiest vein, interspersing the speeches with\r\nappropriate and felicitous songs. Lucretia Mott did not confine\r\nherself to a single speech, but, in Quaker style, whenever the\r\nspirit moved made many happy points. When she first arose to speak,\r\na call came from the audience for her to ascend the pulpit in order\r\nthat she might be seen. As she complied with this request,\r\nascending the long winding staircase into the old-fashioned octagon\r\npulpit, she said, \"I am somewhat like Zaccheus of old who climbed\r\nthe sycamore tree his Lord to see; I climb this pulpit, not because\r\nI am of lofty mind, but because I am short of stature that you may\r\nsee me.\" As her sweet and placid countenance appeared above the\r\npulpit, the Hutchinsons, by happy inspiration, burst into \"Nearer,\r\nmy God, to Thee.\" The effect was marvelous; the audience at once\r\narose, and spontaneously joined in the hymn.\r\n\r\nPhoebe W. Couzins, with great pathos, referred to woman's work in\r\nthe war, and the parade of the Grand Army of the Republic the\r\npreceding evening; she said:\r\n\r\n     In such an hour as this, with my soul stirred to its deepest\r\n     depths, I feel unequal to the task of uttering words befitting\r\n     the occasion, and to follow the dear saint who has just spoken;\r\n     how can I? I am but a beginner, and to-day I feel that to sit at\r\n     the feet of these dear women who have borne the heat and burden\r\n     of this contest, and to learn of them is the attitude I should\r\n     assume. It is not the time for argument or rhetoric. It is the\r\n     time for introspection and prayer. We have come from Independence\r\n     Square, where the nation is celebrating its centennial birthday\r\n     of a masculine freedom. You have just heard from Mrs. Stanton the\r\n     reading of Woman's Declaration of Rights; that document has\r\n     already been presented in engrossed form, tied with the symbolic\r\n     red, white and blue, to the presiding officer of the day, Senator\r\n     Thomas W. Ferry, on their platform in yonder square; and the John\r\n     Hampden of our cause, the immortal Susan B. Anthony, rendered it\r\n     historic, by reading it from the steps of Independence Hall, to\r\n     an immense audience there gathered, that could not gain access to\r\n     the square or platform. [Great applause.] I cannot express to you\r\n     in fitting language the thoughts and feelings which stirred me as\r\n     I sat on the platform, awaiting the presentation of that\r\n     document.\r\n\r\n     We were about to commit an overt act. Gen. Hawley, president of\r\n     the centennial commission and manager of the programme, had\r\n     peremptorily forbidden its presentation. Yet in the face of\r\n     this--in the face of the assembled nation and representatives\r\n     from the crowned heads of Europe, a handful of women actuated by\r\n     the same high principles as our fathers, stirred by the same\r\n     desire for freedom, moved by the same impulse for liberty, were\r\n     to again proclaim the right of self-government; were again to\r\n     impeach the spirit of King George manifested in our rulers, and\r\n     declare that taxation without representation is tyranny, that the\r\n     divine right of one-half of the people to rule the other half is\r\n     also despotism. As I followed the reading of Richard Henry Lee,\r\n     and marked the wild enthusiasm of its reception, and remembered\r\n     that at its close, a document, as noble, as divine, as grand, as\r\n     historic as that, was to be presented _in silence_; an act, as\r\n     heroic, as worthy, as sublime, was to be performed in the face of\r\n     the contemptuous amazement of the assembled world, I trembled\r\n     with suppressed emotion. When Susan Anthony arose, with a look of\r\n     intense pain, yet heroic determination in her face, I silently\r\n     committed her to the Great Father who seeth not in part, to\r\n     strengthen and comfort her heroic heart, and then she was lost to\r\n     view in the sudden uprising caused by the burst of applause\r\n     instituted by General Hawley in behalf of the Brazilian emperor.\r\n     And thus at the close of the reading of a document which\r\n     repudiated kings and declared the right of every person to life,\r\n     to liberty and the pursuit of individual happiness, the American\r\n     people, applauding a crowned monarch, received _in silence_ the\r\n     immortal document and protest of its discrowned queens!\r\n\r\n     Shall I recount the emotion that swayed me, as I thought of all\r\n     that woman had done to build up this country; to sustain its\r\n     unity, to perpetuate its principles; of its self-denying and\r\n     heroic Pilgrim and revolutionary mothers; of the work of woman in\r\n     the anti-slavery cause; the agony and death of her travail in its\r\n     second birth for freedom; sustaining the nation by prayers, by\r\n     self-sacrificing contributions, by patriotic endeavors, by\r\n     encouraging words; and, reviewing the programme, and all the\r\n     attendant pageants, remembered that in these grand centennial\r\n     celebrations, when the nation rounded out its first century, _not\r\n     a tribute_, not a recognition in any shape, form or manner was\r\n     paid to woman; that upon the platform, as honored guests, sat\r\n     those who had been false in the hour of our country's peril; that\r\n     upon this historic soil, stood the now freeman, once a slave,\r\n     whose liberty and life were given him at the hands of woman; that\r\n     the inhabitants of the far off isles of the sea, India, Asia,\r\n     Africa, Europe, were gladly welcomed as free citizens, while\r\n     woman, a suppliant beggar, pleaded of one man, invested with\r\n     autocratic power, for the simple boon of presenting a protest in\r\n     silence, against her degradation, and was _denied_!\r\n\r\n     I stood yesterday on the corner of Broad and Chestnut streets,\r\n     watching the march of the Grand Army of the Republic. As the torn\r\n     and tattered battle flags came by, all the terrors of that war\r\n     tragedy suddenly rushed over me, and I sat down and wept. Looking\r\n     again, I saw the car of wounded, soldiers; as in thought I was\r\n     suddenly transported to the banks of the Mississippi I felt the\r\n     air full of the horrors of the battle of Shiloh, and saw two\r\n     young girls waiting the landing of a steamer that had been\r\n     dispatched to succor the wounded on that terrible field. They\r\n     were watching for \"mother\"--who for the first time had left her\r\n     home charge, and hushing her own heart's pleadings, heard only\r\n     her country's call, and gone down to that field of carnage to\r\n     tenderly care for the soldier. As they boarded the steamer; what\r\n     a sight met their eyes! Maimed, bleeding, dying soldiers by the\r\n     hundreds, were on cots on deck, on boxes filled with amputated\r\n     limbs, and the dead were awaiting the last sad rites. Like\r\n     ministering angels walked two women, their mother and the now\r\n     sainted Margaret Breckenridge of Kentucky, amid these rows of\r\n     sufferers, with strong nerve and steady arm, comforting the\r\n     soldier boy, so far from friends and home; binding up the ghastly\r\n     wound, bathing the feverish brow, smoothing the dying pillow, and\r\n     with tender mother's prayer and tear, closing the eyes of the\r\n     dead. The first revelation of war; how it burned our youthful\r\n     brain! How it moved us to divine compassion, how it stirred us to\r\n     even give up our mother to the work for years, as we heard the\r\n     piteous pleading, \"Don't leave us, mother\"--\"Oh, mother, we can\r\n     never forget.\" But alas they _did_ forget! This scene repeated\r\n     again, and again, during that long conflict, with hundreds of\r\n     women offering a like service in camp and floating hospital,\r\n     leaving sweet homes, without money, price or thought of\r\n     emolument, going to these battle-fields and tenderly nursing the\r\n     army of the republic to life again; while back of them were tens\r\n     of thousands other women of the great sanitary army, who, in\r\n     self-sacrifice at home, were sending lint, bandages, clothing,\r\n     delicacies of food and raiment of all kinds, by car-load and\r\n     ship-load, to comfort and ameliorate the sufferings of the grand\r\n     army of the republic, and yet as I watched its march in this\r\n     centennial year, its gala day--_not a tribute_ marked its\r\n     gratitude to her who had proved its savior and friend, in the\r\n     hour of peril.\r\n\r\n     Again, came the colored man in rank and file--and in thought I\r\n     saw the fifteenth-amendment jubilee, which proclaimed his\r\n     emancipation. As banner after banner passed me, with the name of\r\n     Garrison, of Phillips, of Douglass, I looked in vain for the name\r\n     of Harriet Beecher Stowe, whose one book, \"Uncle Tom's\r\n     Cabin\"--did more to arouse the whole world to the horrors of\r\n     slavery, than did the words or works of any ten men. I searched\r\n     for a tribute to Lucretia Mott and other women of that conflict,\r\n     but none appeared. And so to-day, standing here with heart and\r\n     brain convulsed with all these memories and scenes, can you\r\n     wonder that we are stirred to profoundest depths, as we review\r\n     the base ingratitude of this nation to its women? It has taxed\r\n     its women, and asked the women, in whose veins flows the blood of\r\n     their Pilgrim and Revolutionary mothers, to assist by money,\r\n     individual effort and presence, to make it a year of jubilee for\r\n     the proclamation of a ransomed male nationality. Zenobia, in\r\n     gilded chains it may be, but chains nevertheless, marches through\r\n     the streets of Philadelphia to-day, an appendage of the chariot\r\n     wheels which proclaim the coming of her king, her lord, her\r\n     master, whether he be white or black, native or foreign-born,\r\n     virtuous or vile, lettered or unlettered. As the state-house\r\n     bell, with its inscription, \"Proclaim liberty--throughout the\r\n     land, unto all the inhabitants thereof,\" pealed forth its\r\n     jubilant reiteration,--the daughters of Jefferson, of Hancock, of\r\n     Adams, and Patrick Henry, who have been politically outlawed and\r\n     ostracized by their own countrymen, here had no liberty\r\n     proclaimed for them; they are not inhabitants, only sojourners in\r\n     the land of their fathers, and as the slaves in meek subjection\r\n     to the will of the master placed the crown of sovereignty on the\r\n     alien from Europe, Asia, Africa, she is asked to sing in dulcet\r\n     strains: \"The king is dead--long live the king!\"\r\n\r\n     And thus to-day we round out the first century of a professed\r\n     republic,--with woman figuratively representing freedom--and yet\r\n     all free, save woman.\r\n\r\nFor five long hours of that hot mid-summer's day, that crowded\r\naudience listened earnestly to woman's demand for equality of\r\nrights before the law. When the convention at last adjourned, the\r\nHutchinsons singing, \"A Hundred Years Hence,\"[14] it was slowly\r\nand reluctantly that the great audience left the house. Judged by\r\nits immediate influence, it was a wonderful meeting. No elaborate\r\npreparations had been made, for not until late on Friday evening\r\nhad it been decided upon, hoping still, as we did, for a\r\nrecognition in the general celebration on Independence Square.\r\nSpeakers were not prepared, hardly a moment of thought had been\r\ngiven as to what should be said, but words fitting for the hour\r\ncame to lips rendered eloquent by the pressure of intense emotion.\r\n\r\nDay after day visitors to the woman suffrage parlors referred to\r\nthis meeting in glowing terms. Ladies from distant States, in\r\nPhiladelphia to visit the exposition, said that meeting was worth\r\nthe whole expense of the journey. Young women with all the\r\nattractions of the day and the exposition enticing them, yet said,\r\n\"The best of all I have seen in Philadelphia was that meeting.\"\r\nWomen to whom a dollar was of great value, said, \"As much as I need\r\nmoney, I would not have missed that meeting for a hundred dollars\";\r\nwhile in the midst of conversation visitors would burst forth, \"Was\r\nthere _ever_ such a meeting as that in Dr. Furness' church?\" and\r\nthus was Woman's Declaration of Rights joyously received.\r\n\r\nThe day was also celebrated by women in convocations of their own\r\nall over the country.[15]\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of the centennial parlors was an immense\r\nautograph book, in which the names of friends to the movement were\r\nregistered by the thousands, some penned on that historic day and\r\nsent from the old world and the new, and others written on the spot\r\nduring these eventful months. From the tidings of all these\r\nenthusiastic assemblies and immense number of letters[16] received\r\nin Philadelphia, unitedly demanding an extension of their rights,\r\nit was evident that the thinking women of the nation were hopefully\r\nwaiting in the dawn of the new century for greater liberties to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nFrom \"Aunt Lottie's Centennial Letters to her Nieces and Nephews,\"\r\nwe give the one describing this occasion:\r\n\r\n     MY DEARS: I suppose I had best tell you in this letter about the\r\n     Fourth of July celebration at the centennial city--at least that\r\n     portion of it that I know about, and which I would not have\r\n     missed for the exhibition itself, and which I would not have you\r\n     miss for all the rest of my letters. I cannot expect you to be as\r\n     much interested in it as was I, but it is time you were becoming\r\n     interested in the subject; and, if you live a half century from\r\n     this time (in less than that, I hope,) you will see that what I\r\n     am about to relate was, as General Hawley admitted it would be,\r\n     \"the event of the occasion.\"\r\n\r\n     At the commencement of the exhibition, Miss Susan B. Anthony and\r\n     Mrs. Matilda Joslyn Gage came to Philadelphia and procured the\r\n     parlors of 1,431 Chestnut street for the accommodation of the\r\n     National Woman Suffrage Association. These rooms were open to the\r\n     friends of the association, and public receptions were held and\r\n     well attended every Tuesday and Friday evening. During these\r\n     months these two ladies--assisted the latter part of the time by\r\n     Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton--were engaged in preparing a history\r\n     of the suffrage movement and a declaration of rights to be\r\n     presented at the great centennial celebration of the Fourth of\r\n     July, 1876. This document is in form like the first declaration\r\n     of a hundred years ago, handsomely engrossed by Mrs. Sara Andrews\r\n     Spencer, of Washington--a lady delegate to the Cincinnati\r\n     Republican convention, June 12.\r\n\r\n     The celebration was held in Independence Square, just back of the\r\n     old state-house where the first declaration was signed. There was\r\n     a great crowd of people collected; a poem was read by Bayard\r\n     Taylor and a speech delivered by William M. Evarts. But I knew it\r\n     was useless to go there expecting to hear any portion of either;\r\n     so I waited until twelve o'clock and then rode down in the cars\r\n     to Dr. Furness' church, corner of Broad and Locust streets, where\r\n     these ladies were to hold their meeting. The church was full, and\r\n     the exercises were opened by Mrs. Mott--the venerable and\r\n     venerated president--a Quaker lady of slight form, attired in a\r\n     plain, light-silk gown, white muslin neckerchief and cap, after\r\n     that exquisitely neat and quaint fashion. Then the Hutchinsons\r\n     sang a hymn, in which all were requested to join. Afterward Mrs.\r\n     Stanton came to the front of the pulpit, the house was hushed, to\r\n     a reverential stillness, and I never yet heard anything so solemn\r\n     and impressive as her reading of the Declaration of Rights of the\r\n     Women of the United States.\r\n\r\n     A printed copy had been given me the day before, when between the\r\n     sessions of the New England American Association in the Academy\r\n     of Music, where were Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe, Rev. Antoinette\r\n     Brown Blackwell, Elizabeth K. Churchill and other pleasant-faced,\r\n     sweet-voiced ladies, I had called at the rooms on Chestnut street\r\n     and folded declarations, for half an hour with Mrs. Stanton,\r\n     which they were distributing by post and in every way all over\r\n     the land. When I read it at home that night I realized its\r\n     importance, but as the next day (the Fourth) was excessively\r\n     warm, I very nearly gave up going, and then I should have missed\r\n     the impressiveness of her reading. When she first commenced, her\r\n     voice seemed choked with emotion. She must have realized what she\r\n     was doing, as we all knew it was the grandest thing that had been\r\n     done in a hundred years. Thrill after thrill went through my\r\n     veins, and the whole scene formed a picture that will yet be the\r\n     subject of artists' pencils and poets' pens. I should have been\r\n     contented to have had the meeting closed then with that best song\r\n     of the Hutchinsons upon the progress of reform, where the young\r\n     gentleman was so much applauded for his solo, \"When Women Shall\r\n     be Free.\" Still we were all interested in Mrs. Spencer's account\r\n     of her interview with General Hawley, and his refusal to permit\r\n     the silent handing-in of the declaration, which, after her\r\n     persistence, assuring him \"it would not take three minutes,\" he\r\n     was obliged to confess was because he was \"very well aware it\r\n     would be the event of the occasion.\" \"Immediately,\" said Mrs.\r\n     Spencer, \"you cannot imagine what an inspiration we all had to do\r\n     it; for,\" added the slight, fair-haired, fluent lady, in a\r\n     humorous manner that called forth laughter and applause, \"I never\r\n     yet was forbidden by a man to do a thing, but that I resolved to\r\n     do it.\"\r\n\r\n     We were also pleased to hear from that earnest woman, Susan B.\r\n     Anthony, inspired by the immutable abstract truths of justice and\r\n     equity. Reports say that she has the air of a Catholic devotee.\r\n     She said that in defiance of \"the powers that be\" she took a\r\n     place on that platform in Independence square, and at the proper\r\n     time delivered the engrossed copy of the declaration to the Hon.\r\n     T. W. Ferry, who received it with a courteous bow; and afterward\r\n     on the steps of Independence Hall she read it to an assembled\r\n     multitude. She had done her centennial day's work for all time;\r\n     and small wonder that mind and body craved rest after such\r\n     tension. She is yet under a hundred dollars fine for voting at\r\n     Rochester, and although from her lectures the last six years she\r\n     has paid $10,000 indebtedness on _The Revolution_, she said she\r\n     never would have paid that fine had she been imprisoned till now.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Lucretia Mott, whom the younger Hutchinson[17] assisted into\r\n     the pulpit--a beautiful sight to see cultured youth supporting\r\n     refined old age--stated that she went up there, \"not because she\r\n     was higher-minded than the rest, but so that her enfeebled voice\r\n     might be better heard.\" The dear old soul is so much stronger\r\n     than her body, that it would seem that she must have greatly\r\n     overtasked herself; though an inspired soul has wonderful\r\n     recuperative forces at command for the temple it inhabits. A\r\n     goodly number of gentlemen were present at this meeting and that\r\n     of the day before--three or four of them making short speeches. A\r\n     Mr. Raper of England, strongly interested in the temperance and\r\n     woman suffrage cause, told us that in his country \"all women\r\n     tax-payers voted for guardians of the poor, upon all educational\r\n     matters, and also upon all municipal affairs. In that respect she\r\n     was in advance of this professed republic. In England there is an\r\n     hereditary aristocracy, here, an aristocracy of sex\"; or, as the\r\n     spirited Lillie Devereux Blake who was present once amusingly\r\n     termed it, of \"the bifurcated garment.\" And now perhaps some\r\n     materially-minded person will ask, \"What are you going to do\r\n     about it? You can't fight!\" forgetting that we are now fighting\r\n     the greatest of all battles, and that the weapons of woman's\r\n     warfare, like her nature at its best development, are moral and\r\n     spiritual.\r\n\r\n                                             LEWISE OLIVER.\r\n     _Philadelphia_, July 13, 1876.\r\n\r\nThe press of the country commented extensively upon the action of\r\nthe women:\r\n\r\n     At noon to-day, in the First Unitarian church, corner Tenth and\r\n     South, the National Woman Suffrage Association will present the\r\n     Woman's Declaration of Rights. The association will hold a\r\n     convention at the same time and place, at which Lucretia Mott is\r\n     announced to preside, and several ladies to make speeches. Most\r\n     of the ladies are known as women of ability and earnest apostles\r\n     of the creed they have espoused for the political enfranchisement\r\n     of women. Their declaration of rights, we do not doubt, will be\r\n     strongly enforced. These ladies, or some of them, have been\r\n     assigned places upon the platform at the grand celebration\r\n     ceremonies to take place in Independence Square to-day; and they\r\n     have requested leave to present their declaration of rights in\r\n     form on that occasion. They do not ask to have it read, we\r\n     believe, but simply that the statement of their case shall go on\r\n     file with the general archives of the day, so that the women of\r\n     1976 may see that their predecessors of 1876 did not let the\r\n     centennial year of independence pass without\r\n     protest.--[Philadelphia _Ledger_, July 4.\r\n\r\n     There was yet another incident of the Fourth, in Independence\r\n     Square. Immediately after the Declaration of Independence had\r\n     been read by Richard Henry Lee, and while the strains of the\r\n     \"Greeting from Brazil\" were rising upon the air, two ladies\r\n     pushed their way vigorously through the crowd and appeared upon\r\n     the speaker's platform. They were Susan B. Anthony and Matilda\r\n     Joslyn Gage. Hustling generals aside, elbowing governors, and\r\n     almost upsetting Dom Pedro in their charge, they reached\r\n     Vice-President Ferry, and handed him a scroll about three feet\r\n     long, tied with ribbons of various colors. He was seen to bow and\r\n     look bewildered; but they had retreated in the same vigorous\r\n     manner before the explanation was whispered about. It appears\r\n     that they demanded a change of programme for the sake of reading\r\n     their address; but if so, this was probably a mere form intended\r\n     for future effect. More than six months ago some of the advocates\r\n     of female suffrage began in this city their crusade against\r\n     celebrating the centennial anniversary of a nation wherein women\r\n     are not permitted to vote. The demand of Miss Anthony and Mrs.\r\n     Gage to be allowed to take part in a commemoration which many of\r\n     their associates discouraged and denounced, would have been a\r\n     cool proceeding had it been made in advance. Made, as it was,\r\n     through a very discourteous interruption, it pre-figures new\r\n     forms of violence and disregard of order which may accompany the\r\n     participation of women in active partisan politics.--[New York\r\n     _Tribune_.\r\n\r\n     The letter of a correspondent, printed in another column,\r\n     describing the presentation of a woman's bill of rights, in\r\n     Independence Square on the Fourth of July, will interest all\r\n     readers, whether or not they think with the correspondent, that\r\n     this little affair was the most important of the day's\r\n     proceedings. We have not a doubt that the persons who were\r\n     concerned in the affair enjoyed it heartily. Those of them who\r\n     made speeches naturally regarded their eloquence as a thing to\r\n     stir the nation. All persons who make speeches do. The day was a\r\n     warm one, and imagination, like the fire-cracker, was on fire. In\r\n     the heat of the occasion, of course, the women who want to vote\r\n     and who desire the protection of the writ of _habeas corpus_\r\n     against the tyranny of actual or possible husbands, felt that\r\n     they were making great folios of history; but the sagacity of the\r\n     press agents and reporters was not at fault. The gatherers of\r\n     news know very well what they are about; and when they decided to\r\n     omit this part of the proceedings from their reports, they simply\r\n     obeyed that instinct upon which their livelihood depends--the\r\n     instinct, namely, to write only of matters in which the public is\r\n     interested.\r\n\r\n     The good women who wrote and published this declaration, fancying\r\n     that they were throwing a bombshell into the gathered crowds of\r\n     American (male) citizens, are very much in earnest, doubtless,\r\n     and are entitled--we have platform authority for saying it--to\r\n     \"respectful consideration\"; but their movement scarcely rises, as\r\n     yet at least, to the dignity of a great historical event. There\r\n     is a prevailing indifference to their cause which is against it.\r\n     The public is not aroused to a fever heat of indignation over the\r\n     wrongs which women are everywhere suffering at the hands of the\r\n     tyrants called husbands. The popular mind is not yet awake to the\r\n     fact that men usually imprison their wives in back parlors and\r\n     maltreat them shamefully. The witnesses, wives to wit, refuse to\r\n     bear testimony to this effect, and the public placidly accepts\r\n     appearance for reality and believes that the gentlewomen who ride\r\n     about in their carriages or haunt the shops of our cities in gay\r\n     apparel are reasonably well contented with their lot in life. In\r\n     a word, it is not hostility so much as calm indifference with\r\n     which the advocates of woman suffrage have to contend, and\r\n     unluckily for them the indifference is very largely\r\n     feminine.--[New York _Evening Post_.\r\n\r\n     There is something awful in the thought that should the woman\r\n     suffragists be continually refused a voice in the affairs of the\r\n     nation they might at last in a fit of desperation, do what our\r\n     fathers did, and frame a declaration of independence, No, 2. Just\r\n     think of an army of crinolines willing to take arms against the\r\n     tyrant man, and sacrifice their lives, if need be, to carry out\r\n     their principles! It is easier to ridicule the woman suffrage\r\n     movement than to answer the arguments advanced by some of the\r\n     leading advocates of that question. It is only the innate\r\n     mildness of the position of women in general that has prevented a\r\n     revolution on this same subject long ago. One hundred thousand\r\n     such fire-eaters as Susan B. Anthony or Elizabeth Cady Stanton in\r\n     the land, could raise a rumpus which would cause the late\r\n     unpleasantness to pale into insignificance. Armed and equipped,\r\n     what a sight would be presented by an army of strong-minded\r\n     women! There would be no considering the question of whether the\r\n     cavalry should ride side-saddle, or _a la_ clothes-pin. Such\r\n     detail would be of too small importance to receive the slightest\r\n     attention; the more vital questions would be, \"How can we\r\n     slaughter the most men?\" \"How can we soonest convince the demons\r\n     that we have rights which must be respected?\" The fact is, that\r\n     if these down-trodden women would take a firm stand in any thing\r\n     like respectable numbers, and assert their claims to suffrage at\r\n     the point of the bayonet, they would be allowed everything they\r\n     asked for. There is not a man in the land who would dare to take\r\n     up arms against a woman. Such a dernier resort on the part of the\r\n     women would be truly laughable, but the matter would cease to be\r\n     a joke, if General Susan B. Anthony, in command of a bloomer\r\n     regiment, should march into the halls of congress, armed\r\n     _cap-a-pie_, and demand the passage of a law in behalf of woman\r\n     suffrage, or the alternative of the general cleaning out of the\r\n     whole body. There is no immediate prospect of such an event, but\r\n     \"hell hath no furies like a woman scorned.\" Long and loud have\r\n     been the appeals of the fair sex for recognition at the\r\n     ballot-box. With that faithful zeal so truly characteristic of\r\n     her sex, she has each time, for many years in the history of this\r\n     country, presented herself before the curious gaze of our\r\n     national conventions, asking, with no little stress of argument,\r\n     for a woman's plank in the platforms. If she has been heard at\r\n     all in the framed resolutions of the parties, the feeling\r\n     prevailing in the conventions has been rather to pacify and put\r\n     her off, than to grant her request through motives of political\r\n     policy. If perseverance is to be awarded, the agitators of the\r\n     woman question will yet carry off the prize they seek. Death\r\n     alone can silence such women as Susan B. Anthony and Cady\r\n     Stanton, and their teachings will live after them and unite\r\n     others of their sex into strong bands of sisterhood in a common\r\n     cause. It is safe to say, if events march on in the same\r\n     direction they have since the calling of the first National\r\n     Woman's Convention, another centennial will see woman in the\r\n     halls of legislation throughout the land, and so far as we are\r\n     concerned we have no objection, so long as she behaves\r\n     herself.--[St. Louis _Dispatch_, July 13.\r\n\r\n     It is a curious anomaly that the movement for national woman\r\n     suffrage in our country is most obstructed by women, and that\r\n     even where the men have doubts, their natural admiration for the\r\n     gentler sex almost converts them into champions. Certain it is\r\n     that the Declaration of Rights of the Women of the United States\r\n     that the National Woman Suffrage Association presented to the\r\n     vice-president, Mr. Ferry, while he was surrounded by foreign\r\n     princes and potentates and by the governors of most of the States\r\n     of the union, faced at the same time by a countless mass of\r\n     American and foreign visitors--certain it is, we repeat, that\r\n     when this altogether unique paper was presented by Miss Susan B.\r\n     Anthony and her sisters, it became a record in the minds and\r\n     memory of all who witnessed the strange proceeding. And it is a\r\n     very well written statement, and no doubt one hundred years hence\r\n     it will be read with an interest not less ecstatic than the\r\n     enthusiasm of its present pioneers; for, in the interval, these\r\n     advanced women may have won for their withholding sisters the\r\n     entire list of male prerogatives. What adds to the force of the\r\n     present woman suffrage party is the dignity, intelligence and\r\n     purity of its participants. The venerable Lucretia Mott; the\r\n     honest, straightforward Susan B. Anthony; the cultivated Ellen\r\n     Clark Sargent (wife of the California senator); the beloved\r\n     Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and indeed all the names attached to the\r\n     declaration command our respect. Whatever we may think of the\r\n     points of the declaration itself, with all our sincere admiration\r\n     of these gentlewomen, increased by the knowledge everywhere that\r\n     they are ardent republicans, we fear that their weakness, to\r\n     employ a paradox, consists in their strength, or, in other words,\r\n     that it is difficult to induce even the most benevolent and\r\n     sympathetic observer to believe that they are really as much\r\n     persecuted and oppressed as they claim to be. When the colored\r\n     man demanded his rights they were given to him because these\r\n     rights in republican constitutions were regarded as inherent, and\r\n     also because he had reciprocal duties to discharge, and heavy\r\n     burdens to carry, and when the Southern confederate demanded\r\n     restitution of his rights, he rested his claim upon the double\r\n     basis that he had earned forgiveness by his bravery, and that\r\n     political disfranchisement did not belong to a republican\r\n     example. Fortunately or unfortunately, it is very different with\r\n     the ladies; and so when they come forward insisting upon rights\r\n     heretofore accorded to men alone, they must encounter all the\r\n     differences created by the delicacy of their own sisters and the\r\n     reverence and love of the men, and the hard fact that these two\r\n     influences have made it heretofore impossible for women to\r\n     descend to the arena of politics. Having said this much, we\r\n     present a few of the cardinal points of the woman's declaration\r\n     of rights laid before the august memorial centennial celebration\r\n     last Tuesday, July 4, 1876.--[Philadelphia _Press_, July 15.\r\n\r\nOn July 19, the Citizens' Suffrage Association, of Philadelphia,\r\njoined with the National Association in commemorating the first\r\nwoman's rights convention called by Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth\r\nCady Stanton, at Seneca Falls, N. Y., July 19, 1848--thus\r\ncelebrating the twenty-eighth anniversary of that historic event.\r\nThe meeting was presided over by Edward M. Davis, president of the\r\nassociation, son-in-law of Lucretia Mott, and one of the most\r\nuntiring workers in the cause. The venerable Lucretia Mott\r\naddressed the meeting, and Miss Anthony read letters from several\r\nof the earliest and most valued pioneers of the movement:\r\n\r\n                                   TENAFLY, New Jersey, July 19, 1876.\r\n\r\n     LUCRETIA MOTT--_Esteemed Friend_: It is twenty-eight years ago\r\n     to-day since the first woman's rights convention ever held\r\n     assembled in the Wesleyan chapel at Seneca Falls, N. Y. Could we\r\n     have foreseen, when we called that convention, the ridicule,\r\n     persecution, and misrepresentation that the demand for woman's\r\n     political, religious and social equality would involve; the long,\r\n     weary years of waiting and hoping without success; I fear we\r\n     should not have had the courage and conscience to begin such a\r\n     protracted struggle, nor the faith and hope to continue the work.\r\n     Fortunately for all reforms, the leaders, not seeing the\r\n     obstacles which block the way, start with the hope of a speedy\r\n     success. Our demands at the first seemed so rational that I\r\n     thought the mere statement of woman's wrongs would bring\r\n     immediate redress. I thought an appeal to the reason and\r\n     conscience of men against the unjust and unequal laws for women\r\n     that disgraced our statute books, must settle the question. But I\r\n     soon found, while no attempt was made to answer our arguments,\r\n     that an opposition, bitter, malignant, and persevering, rooted in\r\n     custom and prejudice, grew stronger with every new demand made,\r\n     with every new privilege granted.\r\n\r\n     How well I remember that July day when the leading ladies and\r\n     gentlemen of the busy town crowded into the little church;\r\n     lawyers loaded with books, to expound to us the laws; ladies with\r\n     their essays, and we who had called the convention, with our\r\n     declaration of rights, speeches, and resolutions. With what\r\n     dignity James Mott, your sainted husband, tall and stately, in\r\n     Quaker costume, presided over our novel proceedings. And your\r\n     noble sister, Martha C. Wright, was there. Her wit and wisdom\r\n     contributed much to the interest of our proceedings, and her\r\n     counsel in a large measure to what success we claimed for our\r\n     first convention. While so many of those early friends fell off\r\n     through indifference, fear of ridicule and growing conservatism,\r\n     she remained through these long years of trial steadfast to the\r\n     close of a brave, true life. She has been present at nearly every\r\n     convention, with her encouraging words and generous\r\n     contributions, and being well versed in Cushing's Manual, has\r\n     been one of our chief presiding officers. And my heart is filled\r\n     with gratitude, even at this late day, as I recall the\r\n     earnestness and eloquence with which Frederick Douglass advocated\r\n     our cause, though at that time he had no rights himself that any\r\n     white man was bound to respect. I marvel now, that in our\r\n     inexperience the interest was so well sustained through two\r\n     entire days, and that when the meeting adjourned everybody signed\r\n     the declaration and went home feeling that a new era had dawned\r\n     for woman. What had been done and said seemed so preeminently\r\n     wise and proper that none of us thought of being ridiculed,\r\n     ostracised, or suspected of evil. But what was our surprise and\r\n     chagrin to find ourselves, in a few days, the target for the\r\n     press of the nation; the New York _Tribune_ being our only strong\r\n     arm of defense.\r\n\r\n     Looking over these twenty-eight years, I feel that what we have\r\n     achieved, as yet, bears no proportion to what we have suffered in\r\n     the daily humiliation of spirit from the cruel distinctions based\r\n     on sex. Though our State laws have been essentially changed, and\r\n     positions in the schools, professions, and world of work secured\r\n     to woman, unthought of thirty years ago, yet the undercurrent of\r\n     popular thought, as seen in our social habits, theological\r\n     dogmas, and political theories, still reflects the same customs,\r\n     creeds, and codes that degrade women in the effete civilizations\r\n     of the old world. Educated in the best schools to logical\r\n     reasoning, trained to liberal thought in politics, religion and\r\n     social ethics under republican institutions, American women\r\n     cannot brook the discriminations in regard to sex that were\r\n     patiently accepted by the ignorant in barbarous ages as divine\r\n     law. And yet subjects of emperors in the old world, with their\r\n     narrow ideas of individual rights, their contempt of all\r\n     womankind, come here to teach the mothers of this republic their\r\n     true work and sphere. Such men as Carl Schurz, breathing for the\r\n     first time the free air of our free land, object to what we\r\n     consider the higher education of women, fitting them for the\r\n     trades and professions, for the sciences and arts, and\r\n     self-complacently point Lucretia Mott, Maria Mitchell, Harriet\r\n     Beecher Stowe, Susan B. Anthony, to their appropriate sphere, as\r\n     housekeepers with a string of keys, like Madam Bismark, dangling\r\n     around their waists.\r\n\r\n     The Rev. J. G. Holland, the Tupper of our American literature,\r\n     thanks his Creator that woman has no specialty. She was called\r\n     into being for man's happiness and interest--his helpmeet--to\r\n     wait and watch his movements, to second his endeavors, to fight\r\n     the hard battle of life behind him whose brain may be dizzy with\r\n     excess, whose limbs may be paralyzed, or if sound in body, may be\r\n     without aim or ambition, without plans or projects, destitute of\r\n     executive ability or good judgment in the business affairs of\r\n     life. And such sentimentalists, after demoralizing women with\r\n     their twaddle, discourage our demand for the right of suffrage by\r\n     pointing us to the fact that the majority of women are\r\n     indifferent to this movement in their behalf. Suppose they are;\r\n     have not the masses of all oppressed classes been apathetic and\r\n     indifferent until partial success crowned the enthusiasm of the\r\n     few? Carl Schurz would not have been exiled from his native land\r\n     could he have roused the majority of his countrymen to the same\r\n     love of liberty which burned in his own soul. Were his dreams of\r\n     freedom less real because the stolid masses were not awake to\r\n     their significance? Shall a soul that accepts martyrdom for a\r\n     principle be told he is sacrificing himself to a shadow because\r\n     the multitude can neither see nor appreciate the idea?\r\n\r\n     I do not feel like rejoicing over any privileges already granted\r\n     to my sex, until all our rights are conceded and secured and the\r\n     principle of equality recognized and proclaimed, for every step\r\n     that brings us to a more equal plane with man but makes us more\r\n     keenly feel the loss of those rights we are still denied--more\r\n     susceptible to the insults of his assumptions and usurpations of\r\n     power. As I sum up the indignities toward women, as illustrated\r\n     by recent judicial decisions--denied the right to vote, denied\r\n     the right to practice in the Supreme Court, denied jury trial--I\r\n     feel the degradation of sex more bitterly than I did on that July\r\n     19, 1848, and never more than in listening to your speech in\r\n     Philadelphia on the Fourth of July, our nation's centennial\r\n     birthday, remembering that neither years nor wisdom, brave words\r\n     nor noble deeds, could secure political honor or call forth\r\n     national homage for women. Let it be remembered by our daughters\r\n     in future generations that Lucretia Mott, in the eighty-fourth\r\n     year of her age, asked permission, as the representative woman of\r\n     this great movement for the enfranchisement of her sex, to\r\n     present at the centennial celebration of our national liberties,\r\n     Woman's Declaration of Rights, and was refused! This was the\r\n     \"respectful consideration\" vouchsafed American women at the close\r\n     of the first century of our national life.\r\n\r\n     May we now safely prophesy justice, liberty, equality for our\r\n     daughters ere another centennial birthday shall dawn upon us!\r\n\r\n               Sincerely yours,                ELIZABETH CADY STANTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        DETROIT, July 17, 1876.\r\n\r\n     _To Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Mary Ann McClintock\r\n     and daughters, Amy Post, and all associated with them and myself\r\n     in the first Woman's Rights Convention, held in Seneca Falls, N.\r\n     Y., July 19, 1848, as well as to our later and present\r\n     associates, Greeting:_\r\n\r\n     Not able to be with you in your celebration of the nineteenth, I\r\n     will yet give evidence that I prize your remembrance of our first\r\n     assemblage and of our earliest work. That is, and will ever be as\r\n     the present is a memorable year; and may this be memorable too\r\n     for the same reason, a brave step in advance for human freedom. I\r\n     would that it could be a conclusive step in legislation for the\r\n     political freedom of the women of the nation. For it is only in\r\n     harmony with reason and experience to predict that the men as\r\n     well as the women of the near future will rejoice if this\r\n     centennial year is thus marked and glorified by so grand a deed.\r\n\r\n     We may well congratulate each other and have satisfaction in\r\n     knowing that we have changed the public sentiment and the laws of\r\n     many States by our advocacy and labors. We also know that while\r\n     helping the growth of our own souls, we have set many women\r\n     thinking and reading on this vital question, who in turn have\r\n     discussed it in private and public, and thus inspired others. So\r\n     that at this present time few who have examined can deny our\r\n     claim. But we are grateful to remember many women who needed no\r\n     arguments, whose clear insight and reason, pronounced in the\r\n     outset that a woman's soul was as well worth saving as a man's;\r\n     that her independence and free choice are as necessary and as\r\n     valuable to the public virtue and welfare; who saw and still see\r\n     in both, equal children of a Father who loves and protects all.\r\n\r\n     Men do not need to be convinced of the righteousness of entire\r\n     freedom for us; they have long been convinced of its justice;\r\n     they confess that it is only expediency which makes them withhold\r\n     that which they profess is precious to them. We await only an\r\n     awakened conscience and an enlarged statesmanship.\r\n\r\n     I bid you and the women of the republic God-speed, and close in\r\n     the language of one who went before us, Mary Wollstonecraft, who\r\n     did so much in a thoughtless age to bring both men and women back\r\n     to virtue and religion. She says: \"Contending for the rights of\r\n     woman, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that\r\n     if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of\r\n     man, she will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue; for\r\n     truth must be common to all or it will be inefficacious with\r\n     respect to its influence in general practice. And how can woman\r\n     be expected to cooeperate unless she know why she ought to be\r\n     virtuous; unless freedom strengthen her reason till she\r\n     comprehends her duty and sees in what manner it is connected with\r\n     her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the\r\n     true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and\r\n     the love of mankind from which an orderly train of virtues\r\n     spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil\r\n     interests of mankind; but the education and situation of woman at\r\n     present, shuts her out from such investigations.\"\r\n\r\n     With the greatest possible interest in your celebration and\r\n     deliberations, and assuring you that I shall be with you in\r\n     thought and spirit, I am most earnestly and cordially yours,\r\n\r\n                                             CATHARINE A. F. STEBBINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   ROCHESTER, N. Y., June 27, 1876.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SUSAN ANTHONY: I thank thee most deeply for the assurance\r\n     of a welcome to your deliberative councils in our country's\r\n     centennial year, to reannounce our oft-repeated protest against\r\n     bondage to tyrant law. Most holy cause! Woman's equality, why so\r\n     long denied?... I was ready at the first tap of the drum that\r\n     sounded from that hub of our country, Seneca Falls, in 1848,\r\n     calling for an assembly of men and women to set forth and\r\n     remonstrate against the legal usurpation of our rights.... I\r\n     cannot think of anything that would give me as much pleasure as\r\n     to be able to meet with you at this time. I am exceedingly glad\r\n     that you appreciate the blessings of frequent visits and wise\r\n     counsel from our beloved and venerated pioneer, Lucretia Mott. I\r\n     hope her health and strength will enable her to see and enjoy the\r\n     triumphant victory of this work, and I wish you all the blessings\r\n     of happiness that belong to all good workers, and my love to them\r\n     all as if named.\r\n\r\n                                                   AMY POST.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    POMO, Mendocino Co., California, June 26, 1876.\r\n\r\n     July 4, 1776, our revolutionary fathers--in convention\r\n     assembled--declared their independence of the mother country;\r\n     solemnly asserted the divine right of self-government and its\r\n     relation to constituted authority. With liberty their shibboleth,\r\n     the colonies triumphed in their long and fierce struggle with the\r\n     mother country, and established an independent government. They\r\n     adopted a \"bill of rights\" embodying their ideal of a free\r\n     government.\r\n\r\n     With singular inconsistency almost their first act, while it\r\n     secured to one-half the people of the body politic the right to\r\n     tax and govern themselves, subjected the other half to the very\r\n     oppression which had culminated in the rebellion of the colonies,\r\n     \"taxation without representation,\" and the inflictions of an\r\n     authority to which they had not given their consent. The\r\n     constitutional provision which enfranchised the male population\r\n     of the new State and secured to it self-governing rights,\r\n     disfranchised its women, and eventuated in a tyrannical use of\r\n     power, which, exercised by husbands, fathers, and brothers, is\r\n     infinitely more intolerable than the despotic acts of a foreign\r\n     ruler.\r\n\r\n     As if left ignobly to illustrate the truths of their noble\r\n     declarations, no sooner did the enfranchised class enter upon the\r\n     exercise of their usurped powers than they proceeded to alienate\r\n     from the mothers of humanity rights declared to be inseparable\r\n     from humanity itself! Had they thrust the British yoke from the\r\n     necks of their wives and daughters as indignantly as they thrust\r\n     it from their own, the legal subjection of the women of to-day\r\n     would not stand out as it now does--the reproach of our\r\n     republican government. As if sons did not follow the condition of\r\n     the mothers--as if daughters had no claim to the birthright of\r\n     the fathers--they established for disfranchised woman a \"dead\r\n     line,\" by retaining the English common law of marriage, which,\r\n     unlike that of less liberal European governments, converts the\r\n     marriage altar into an executioner's block and recognizes woman\r\n     as a wife only when so denuded of personal rights that in legal\r\n     phrase she is said to be--\"dead in law\"!\r\n\r\n     More considerate in the matter of forms than the highwayman who\r\n     kills that he may rob the unresisting dead, our gallant fathers\r\n     executed women who must need cross the line of human\r\n     happiness--legally; and administered their estate; and decreed\r\n     the disposition of their defunct personalities in legislative\r\n     halls; only omitting to provide for the matrimonial crypt the\r\n     fitting epitaph: \"Here lies the relict of American freedom--taxed\r\n     to pauperism, loved to death!\"\r\n\r\n     With all the modification of the last quarter, of a century, our\r\n     English law of marriage still invests the husband with a\r\n     sovereignty almost despotic over his wife. It secures to him her\r\n     personal service and savings, and the control and custody of her\r\n     person as against herself. Having thus reduced the wife to a dead\r\n     pauper owing service to her husband, our shrewd forefathers, to\r\n     secure the bond, confiscated her natural obligations as a child\r\n     and a mother. Whether married or single, only inability excuses a\r\n     son from the legal support of indigent and infirm parents. The\r\n     married daughter, in the discharge of her wifely duties, may\r\n     tenderly care and toil for her husband's infirm parents, or his\r\n     children and grandchildren by a prior marriage, while her own\r\n     parents, or children by a prior marriage--legally divested of any\r\n     claim on her or the husband who absorbs her personal services and\r\n     earnings--are sent to the poor-house, or pine in bitter\r\n     privation; except with consent of her husband, she can give\r\n     neither her personal care nor the avails of her industry, for\r\n     their benefit. So, to be a wife, woman ceases, in law, to be\r\n     anything else--yields up the ghost of a legal existence! That she\r\n     escapes the extreme penalty of her legal bonds in any case is\r\n     due to the fact that the majority of men, married or single, are\r\n     notably better than their laws.\r\n\r\n     Our fathers taught the quality and initiated the form of free\r\n     government. But it was left to their posterity to learn from the\r\n     discipline of experience, that truths, old as the eternities, are\r\n     forever revealing new phases to render possible more perfect\r\n     interpretations; and to accumulate unanswerable reasons for their\r\n     extended application. That the sorest trials and most appreciable\r\n     failures of the government our fathers bequeathed, to us, have\r\n     been the direct and inevitable results of their departures from\r\n     the principles they enunciated, is so patent to all Christendom,\r\n     that free government itself has won from our mistakes material to\r\n     revolutionize the world--lessons that compel depotisms to change\r\n     their base and constitutional monarchies to make broader the\r\n     phylacteries of popular rights.\r\n\r\n     Is it not meet then, that on this one-hundredth anniversary of\r\n     American independence the daughters of revolutionary sires should\r\n     appeal to the sons to fulfill what the fathers promised but\r\n     failed to perform--should appeal to them as the constituted\r\n     executors of the father's will, to give full practical effect to\r\n     the self-evident truths, that \"taxation without representation is\r\n     tyranny\"--that \"governments derive their just powers from the\r\n     consent of the governed\"? With an evident common interest in all\r\n     the affairs of which government properly or improperly takes\r\n     cognizance, we claim enfranchisement on the broad ground of human\r\n     right, having proved the justice of our claim by the injustice\r\n     which has resulted to us and ours through our disfranchisement.\r\n\r\n     We ask enfranchisement in the abiding faith that with our\r\n     cooeperative efforts free government would attain to higher\r\n     averages of intelligence and virtue; with an innate conviction,\r\n     that the sequestration of rights in the homes of the republic\r\n     makes them baneful nurseries of the monopolies, rings, and\r\n     fraudulent practices that are threatening the national integrity;\r\n     and that so long as the fathers sequester the rights of the\r\n     mothers and train their sons to exercise, and the daughters to\r\n     submit to the exactions of usurped powers, our government offices\r\n     will be dens of thieves and the national honor trail in the dust;\r\n     and honest men come out from the fiery ordeals of faithful\r\n     service, denuded of the confidence and respect justly their due.\r\n     Give us liberty! We are mothers, wives, and daughters of freemen.\r\n\r\n                                             C. I. H. NICHOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        LONDON, Eng., July 4, 1876.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SUSAN: I sincerely thank you for your kind letter. Many\r\n     times I have thought of writing to you, but I knew your time was\r\n     too much taken up with the good cause to have any to spare for\r\n     private correspondence. Occasionally I am pleased to see a good\r\n     account of you and your doings in the Boston _Investigator_. Oh,\r\n     how I wish I could be with you on this more than ordinarily\r\n     interesting and important occasion; or that I could at least send\r\n     my sentiments and views on human rights, which I have advocated\r\n     for over forty years, to the convention.\r\n\r\n     This being the centenary day of the proclamation of American\r\n     independence, I must write a few lines, if but to let the friends\r\n     know that though absent in body I am with you in the cause for\r\n     which, in common with you, I have labored so long, and I hope not\r\n     labored in vain.\r\n\r\n     The glorious day upon which human equality was first proclaimed\r\n     ought to be commemorated, not only every hundred years, or every\r\n     year, but it ought to be constantly held before the public mind\r\n     until its grand principles are carried into practice. The\r\n     declaration that \"All men [which means all human beings\r\n     irrespective of sex] have an equal right to life, liberty, and\r\n     the pursuit of happiness,\" is enough for woman as for man. We\r\n     need no other; but we must reassert in 1876 what 1776 so\r\n     gloriously proclaimed, and call upon the law-makers and the\r\n     law-breakers to carry that declaration to its logical consistency\r\n     by giving woman the right of representation in the government\r\n     which she helps to maintain; a voice in the laws by which she is\r\n     governed, and all the rights and privileges society can bestow,\r\n     the same as to man, or disprove its validity. We need no other\r\n     declaration. All we ask is to have the laws based on the same\r\n     foundation upon which that declaration rests, viz.: upon equal\r\n     justice, and not upon sex. Whenever the rights of man are\r\n     claimed, moral consistency points to the equal rights of woman.\r\n\r\n     I hope these few lines will fill a little space in the convention\r\n     at Philadelphia, where my voice has so often been raised in\r\n     behalf of the principles of humanity. I am glad to see my name\r\n     among the vice-presidents of the National Association. Keep a\r\n     warm place for me with the American people. I hope some day to be\r\n     there yet. Give my love to Mrs. Mott and Sarah Pugh. With kind\r\n     regards from Mr. Rose,\r\n\r\n                         Yours affectionately,     ERNESTINE L. ROSE.\r\n\r\nA new paper, _The Ballot-Box_, was started in the centennial year\r\nat Toledo, Ohio, owned and published by Mrs. Sarah Langdon\r\nWilliams. The following editorial on the natal day of the republic\r\nis from her pen:\r\n\r\n     THE RETROSPECT.--Since our last issue the great centennial\r\n     anniversary of American independence has come and gone; it has\r\n     been greeted with rejoicing throughout the land; its events have\r\n     passed into history. The day in which the great principles\r\n     embodied in the Declaration of Independence were announced by the\r\n     revolutionary fathers to the world has been celebrated through\r\n     all this vast heritage, with pomp and popular glorification, and\r\n     the nation's finest orators have signalized the event in\r\n     \"thoughts that breathe and words that burn.\" Everywhere has the\r\n     country been arrayed in its holiday attire--the gay insignia\r\n     which, old as the century, puts on fresh youth and brilliancy\r\n     each time its colors are unfurled. The successes which the\r\n     country has achieved have been portrayed with glowing eloquence,\r\n     the people's sovereignty has been the theme of congratulation and\r\n     the glorious principles of freedom and equal rights have been\r\n     enthusiastically proclaimed. In the magnificent oration of Mr.\r\n     Evarts delivered in Independence Square, the spot made sacred by\r\n     the signing of the Declaration of Independence which announced\r\n     that \"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of\r\n     the governed,\" these words occur:\r\n\r\n          The chief concern in this regard, to us and the rest of the\r\n          world is, whether the proud trust, the profound radicalism,\r\n          the wide benevolence which spoke in the declaration and were\r\n          infused into the constitution at the first, have been in\r\n          good-faith adhered to by the people, and whether now the\r\n          living principles supply the living forces which sustain and\r\n          direct government and society. He who doubts needs but to\r\n          look around to find all things full of the original spirit\r\n          and testifying to its wisdom and strength.\r\n\r\n     Yet that very day in that very city was a large assemblage of\r\n     women convened to protest against the gross wrongs of their\r\n     sex--the representatives of twenty millions of citizens of the\r\n     United States, composing one-half of the population being\r\n     governed without their consent by the other half, who, by virtue\r\n     of their superior strength, held the reins of power and\r\n     tyrannically denied them all representation. At that very meeting\r\n     at which that polished falsehood was uttered had the women, but\r\n     shortly before, been denied the privilege of silently presenting\r\n     their declaration of rights. More forcibly is this mortifying\r\n     disregard of the claims of women thrust in their faces from the\r\n     fact that, amid all this magnificent triumph with which the\r\n     growth of the century was commemorated, amid the protestations of\r\n     platforms all over the country of the grand success of the\r\n     principle of equal rights for all, the possibility of the future\r\n     according equal rights to women as well as to men was, with the\r\n     exception of one or two praiseworthy instances, as far as reports\r\n     have reached us, utterly ignored. The women have no\r\n     country--their rights are disregarded, their appeals ignored,\r\n     their protests scorned, they are treated as children who do not\r\n     comprehend their own wants, and as slaves whose crowning duty is\r\n     obedience.\r\n\r\n     Whether, on this great day of national triumph and national\r\n     aspiration, the possibilities of a better future for women were\r\n     forgotten; whether, from carelessness, willfulness, or\r\n     wickedness, their grand services and weary struggles in the past\r\n     and hopes and aspirations for the future were left entirely out\r\n     of the account, certain it is that our orators were too much\r\n     absorbed in the good done by men and for men, to once recur to\r\n     the valuable aid, self-denying patriotism and lofty virtues of\r\n     the nation's unrepresented women. There were a few exceptions:\r\n     Col. Wm. M. Ferry, of Ottawa county, Michigan, in his historical\r\n     address delivered in that county, July Fourth, took pains to make\r\n     favorable mention of the daughter of one of the pioneers, as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n          Louisa Constant, or \"Lisette,\" as she was called, became her\r\n          father's clerk when twelve years old, and was as well known\r\n          for wonderful faculties for business as she was for her\r\n          personal attractions. In 1828, when Lisette was seventeen\r\n          years old, her father died. She closed up his business with\r\n          the British Company, engaged with the American Fur Company,\r\n          at Mackinaw, receiving from them a large supply of\r\n          merchandise, and for six years conducted the most successful\r\n          trading establishment in the northwest.\r\n\r\n     Think of it, ye who disparage the ability of woman! This little\r\n     tribute we record with gratification. Colonel Ferry remembered\r\n     woman. Henry Ward Beecher, in his oration, delivered at\r\n     Peekskill, is reported, to have said:\r\n\r\n          And now there is but one step more--there is but one step\r\n          more. We permit the lame, the halt and the blind to go to\r\n          the ballot-box; we permit the foreigner and the black man,\r\n          the slave and the freeman, to partake of the suffrage; there\r\n          is but one thing left out, and that is the mother that\r\n          taught us, and the wife that is thought worthy to walk side\r\n          by side with us. It is woman that is put lower than the\r\n          slave, lower than the ignorant foreigner. She is put among\r\n          the paupers whom the law won't allow to vote; among the\r\n          insane whom the law won't allow to vote. But the days are\r\n          numbered in which this can take place, and she too will\r\n          vote.\r\n\r\n     But these words are followed by others somewhat problematical, at\r\n     least in the respect rendered to women:\r\n\r\n          As in a hundred years suffrage has extended its bounds till\r\n          it now includes the whole population, in another hundred\r\n          years everything will vote, unless it be the power of the\r\n          loom, and the locomotive, and the watch, and I sometimes\r\n          think, looking at these machines and their performances,\r\n          that they too ought to vote.\r\n\r\n     But Mr. Evarts approached the close of his oration with these\r\n     words--and may they not be prophetic--may not the orator have\r\n     spoken with a deeper meaning than he knew?\r\n\r\n          With these proud possessions of the past, with powers\r\n          matured, with principles settled, with habits formed, the\r\n          nation passes as it were from preparatory growth to\r\n          responsible development of character and the steady\r\n          performance of duty. What labors await it, what trials shall\r\n          attend it, what triumphs for human nature, what glory for\r\n          itself, are prepared for this people in the coming century,\r\n          we may not assume to foretell.\r\n\r\n     Whether the wise (?) legislators see it or not--whether the\r\n     undercurrent that is beating to the shore speaks with an\r\n     utterance that is comprehensible to their heavy apprehensions or\r\n     not, the coming century has in preparation for the country a\r\n     truer humanity, a better justice of which the protest and\r\n     declaration of the fathers pouring its vital current down through\r\n     the departed century, and surging on into the future, is, to the\r\n     seeing eye, the sure forerunner, the seed-time, of which the\r\n     approaching harvest will bring a better fruition for women--and\r\n     they who scoff now will be compelled to rejoice hereafter. But as\r\n     Mr. Evarts remarked in his allusions to future centennials:\r\n\r\n          By the mere circumstance of this periodicity our generation\r\n          will be in the minds, in the hearts, on the lips of our\r\n          countrymen at the next centennial commemoration in\r\n          comparison with their own character and condition and with\r\n          the great founders of the nation. What shall they say of us?\r\n          How shall they estimate the part we bear in the unbroken\r\n          line of the nation's progress? And so on, in the long reach\r\n          of time, forever and forever, our place in the secular roll\r\n          of the ages must always bring us into observation and\r\n          criticism.\r\n\r\n     Shall it then be recorded of us that the demand and the protest\r\n     of the women were not made in vain? Shall it be told to future\r\n     generations that the cry for justice, the effort to sunder the\r\n     shackles with which woman has been oppressed from the dim ages of\r\n     the past, was heeded? Or, shall it be told of us, in the\r\n     beginning of this second centennial, that justice has been\r\n     ignored, that only liberty to men entered at this stage of\r\n     progress, into the American idea of self-government? Freedom to\r\n     men and women alike is but a question of time--is America now\r\n     equal to the great occasion? Has her development expanded to that\r\n     degree where her legislators can say in very truth, as of the\r\n     colored man, \"Let the oppressed go free\"?\r\n\r\nThe woman's pavilion upon the centennial grounds was an\r\nafter-thought, as theologians claim woman herself to have been.[18]\r\nThe women of the country after having contributed nearly $100,000\r\nto the centennial stock, found there had been no provision made for\r\nthe separate exhibition of their work. The centennial board, Mrs.\r\nGillespie, president, then decided to raise funds for the erection\r\nof a separate building to be known as the Woman's Pavilion. It\r\ncovered an acre of ground and was erected at an expense of $30,000,\r\na small sum in comparison with the money which had been raised by\r\nwomen and expended on the other buildings, not to speak of State\r\nand national appropriations which the taxes levied on them had\r\nlargely helped to swell.\r\n\r\nThe pavilion was no true exhibit of woman's work. First, few women\r\nare as yet owners of business which their industry largely makes\r\nremunerative. Cotton factories in which thousands of women work,\r\nare owned by men. The shoe business, in some branches of which\r\nwomen are doing more than half, is under the ownership of men. Rich\r\nembroideries from India, rugs of downy softness from Turkey, the\r\nmuslin of Dacca, anciently known as \"The Woven Wind,\" the pottery\r\nand majolica ware of P. Pipsen's widow, the cartridges and\r\nenvelopes of Uncle Sam, Waltham watches whose finest mechanical\r\nwork is done by women, and ten thousand other industries found no\r\nplace in the pavilion. Said United States Commissioner Meeker,[19]\r\nof Colorado, \"Woman's work comprises three-fourths of the\r\nexposition; it is scattered through every building; take it away\r\nand there would be no exposition.\"\r\n\r\nBut this pavilion rendered one good service to woman in showing her\r\ncapabilities as an engineer. The boiler which furnished the force\r\nfor running its work was under the management of a young Canadian\r\ngirl, Miss Alison, who from a child loved machinery, spending much\r\ntime in the large saw and grist mills of her father, run by engines\r\nof two- and three-hundred horse-power, which she sometimes managed\r\nfor amusement. When her name was proposed for running the pavilion\r\nmachinery it brought much opposition. It was said the committee\r\nwould some day find the pavilion blown to atoms; that the woman\r\nengineer would spend her time reading novels, instead of watching\r\nthe steam gauge; that the idea was impracticable and should not be\r\nthought of. But Miss Alison soon proved her own capabilities and\r\nthe falseness of these prophecies by taking her place in the\r\nengine-room and managing its workings with the ease that a child\r\nspins a top. Six power looms on which women wove carpets, webbing,\r\nsilks, etc., were run by this engine. At a later period the\r\nprinting of _The New Century for Women_, a paper published by the\r\ncentennial commission in the woman's building, was also done by its\r\nmeans. Miss Alison declared the work to be more cleanly, more\r\npleasant, and infinitely less fatiguing than cooking over a kitchen\r\nstove. \"Since I have been compelled to earn my own livelihood,\" she\r\nsaid, \"I have never been engaged in work I liked so well. Teaching\r\nschool is much harder, and one is not paid as well.\" She expressed\r\nconfidence in her ability to manage the engine of an ocean steamer,\r\nand said there were thousands of small engines in use in various\r\nparts of the country, and no reason existed why women should not be\r\nemployed to manage them--following the profession of engineer as a\r\nregular business--an engine requiring far less attention than is\r\ngiven by a nurse-maid or mother to a child.\r\n\r\nBut to have made the woman's pavilion grandly historic, upon its\r\nwalls should have been hung the yearly protest of Harriet K. Hunt\r\nagainst taxation without representation; the legal papers served\r\nupon the Smith sisters when their Alderny cows were seized and sold\r\nfor their refusal to pay taxes while unrepresented; the papers held\r\nby the city of Worcester for the forced sale of the house and lands\r\nof Abby Kelly Foster, the veteran abolitionist, because she refused\r\nto pay taxes, giving the same reason our ancestors gave when they\r\nresisted taxation; a model of Bunker Hill monument, its foundation\r\nlaid by Lafayette in 1825, but which remained unfinished nearly\r\ntwenty years until the famous French _danseuse_ Fanny Ellsler, gave\r\nthe proceeds of an exhibition for that purpose. With these should\r\nhave been exhibited framed copies of all the laws bearing unjustly\r\nupon woman--those which rob her of her name, her earnings, her\r\nproperty, her children, her person; also, the legal papers in the\r\ncase of Susan B. Anthony, who was tried and fined for seeking to\r\ngive consent to the laws which governed her; and the decision of\r\nMr. Justice Miller (Chief-Justice Chase dissenting) in the case of\r\nMyra Bradwell, denying national protection for woman's civil\r\nrights; and the later decision of Chief-Justice Waite of the\r\nSupreme Court against Virginia L. Minor, denying to women national\r\nprotection for their political rights, decisions in favor of\r\nstate-rights which imperil the liberties not only of all women, but\r\nof every white man in the nation.\r\n\r\nWoman's most fitting contributions to the centennial exposition\r\nwould have been these protests, laws and decisions which show her\r\npolitical slavery. But all this was left for rooms outside of the\r\ncentennial grounds, upon Chestnut street, where the National Woman\r\nSuffrage Association hoisted its flag, made its protests, and wrote\r\nthe Declaration of Rights of the Women of the United States.\r\n\r\nTo many thoughtful people it seemed captious and unreasonable for\r\nwomen to complain of injustice in this free land, amidst such\r\nuniversal rejoicings. When the majority of women are seemingly\r\nhappy, it is natural to suppose that the discontent of the minority\r\nis the result of their unfortunate individual idiosyncrasies, and\r\nnot of adverse influences in their established conditions.\r\n\r\nBut the history of the world shows that the vast majority in every\r\ngeneration passively accept the conditions into which they are\r\nborn, while those who demand larger liberties are ever a small,\r\nostracised minority whose claims are ridiculed and ignored. From\r\nour stand-point we honor the Chinese women who claim the right to\r\ntheir feet and powers of locomotion, the Hindoo widows who refuse\r\nto ascend the funeral pyre of their husbands, the Turkish women who\r\nthrow off their masks and veils and leave the harem, the Mormon\r\nwomen who abjure their faith and demand monogamic relations; why\r\nnot equally honor the intelligent minority of American women who\r\nprotest against the artificial disabilities by which their freedom\r\nis limited and their development arrested? That only a few under\r\nany circumstances protest against the injustice of long established\r\nlaws and customs does not disprove the fact of the oppressions,\r\nwhile the satisfaction of the many, if real, only proves their\r\napathy and deeper degradation. That a majority of the women of the\r\nUnited States accept without protest the disabilities that grow out\r\nof their disfranchisement, is simply an evidence of their ignorance\r\nand cowardice, while the minority who demand a higher political\r\nstatus clearly prove their superior intelligence and wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Some suggested that the women in their various towns and\r\ncities, draped in black, should march in solemn procession, bells\r\nslowly tolling, bearing banners with the inscriptions: \"Taxation\r\nwithout representation is tyranny,\" \"No just government can be\r\nformed without the consent of the governed,\" \"They who have no\r\nvoice in the laws and rulers are in a condition of slavery.\"\r\n\r\nOthers suggested that instead of women wearing crape during the\r\ncentennial glorification, the men should sit down in sackcloth and\r\nashes, in humiliation of spirit, as those who repented in olden\r\ntimes were wont to do. The best centennial celebration, said they,\r\nfor the men of the United States, the one to cover them with glory,\r\nwould be to extend to the women of the nation all the rights,\r\nprivileges and immunities that they themselves enjoy.\r\n\r\nOthers proposed that women should monopolize the day, have their\r\nown celebrations, read their own declarations and protests\r\ndemanding justice, liberty and equality. The latter suggestion was\r\nextensively adopted, and the Fourth of July, 1876, was remarkable\r\nfor the large number of women who were \"the orators of the day\" in\r\ntheir respective localities.\r\n\r\n[2] Letters were read from the Hon. Alexander H. Stephens, of\r\nGeorgia; William J. Fowler, of Rochester, N. Y.; Isabella Beecher\r\nHooker, of Connecticut, and Susan B. Anthony.\r\n\r\n[3] News of the cannonade of Boston had been received the day\r\nprevious.\r\n\r\n[4] Though thus discourteously refused to an association to secure\r\nequality of rights for women, it was subsequently rented to \"The\r\nInternational Peace Association.\"\r\n\r\n[5] _President_--Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Tenafly, New Jersey.\r\n\r\n_Vice-Presidents_--Lucretia Mott, Pa.; Ernestine L.

Mrs. Mott and\r\nMrs. Stanton decided for themselves that after these rebuffs they\r\nwould not even sit on the platform, but at the appointed time go to\r\nthe church they had engaged for a meeting, and open their\r\nconvention. Others more brave and determined insisted that women\r\nhad an equal right to the glory of the day and the freedom of the\r\nplatform, and decided to take the risk of a public insult in order\r\nto present the woman's declaration and thus make it an historic\r\ndocument.--[E.C.S.\r\n\r\n[12] During the reading of the declaration to an immense concourse\r\nof people, Mrs. Gage stood beside Miss Anthony, and held an\r\numbrella over her head, to shelter her friend from the intense heat\r\nof the noonday sun; and thus in the same hour, on opposite sides of\r\nold Independence Hall, did the men and women express their opinions\r\non the great principles proclaimed on the natal day of the\r\nrepublic.

Though defeated at the polls, in the\r\ncourts, in the national celebration, in securing a plank in the\r\nplatforms of the Republican and Democratic parties, and in our own\r\nconventions--so far as the few were able to rouse the many to\r\nsimultaneous action--nevertheless a wide-spread agitation had been\r\nsecured by the presentation of this phase of the question.\r\n\r\nAlthough the unanswerable arguments of statesmen and lawyers in the\r\nhalls of congress and the Supreme Court of the United States, had\r\nalike proved unavailing in establishing the civil and political\r\nrights of women on a national basis, their efforts had not been in\r\nvain. The trials had brought the question before a new order of\r\nminds, and secured able constitutional arguments which were\r\nreviewed in many law journals. The equally able congressional\r\ndebates, reported verbatim, read by a large constituency in every\r\nState of the Union, did an educational work on the question of\r\nwoman's enfranchisement that cannot be overestimated.\r\n\r\nBut when the final decision of the Supreme Court in the case of\r\nVirginia L. Minor made all agitation in that direction hopeless,\r\nthe National Association returned to its former policy, demanding a\r\nsixteenth amendment. The women generally came to the conclusion\r\nthat if in truth there was no protection for them in the original\r\nconstitution nor the late amendments, the time had come for some\r\nclearly-defined recognition of their citizenship by a sixteenth\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nThe following appeal and petition were extensively circulated:\r\n\r\n     _To the Women of the United States:_\r\n\r\n     Having celebrated our centennial birthday with a national\r\n     jubilee, let us now dedicate the dawn of the second century to\r\n     securing justice to women. For this purpose we ask you to\r\n     circulate a petition to congress, just issued by the National\r\n     Association, asking an amendment to the United States\r\n     Constitution, that shall prohibit the several States from\r\n     disfranchising citizens on account of sex. We have already sent\r\n     this petition throughout the country for the signatures of those\r\n     men and women who believe in the citizen's right to vote.\r\n\r\n     To see how large a petition each State rolls up, and to do the\r\n     work as expeditiously as possible, it is necessary that some\r\n     person in each county should take the matter in charge, urging\r\n     upon all, thoroughness and haste. * * * The petitions should be\r\n     returned before January 16, 17, 1877, when we shall hold our\r\n     Eighth Annual Convention at the capital, and ask a hearing before\r\n     congress.\r\n\r\n     Having petitioned our law-makers, State and national, for years,\r\n     many from weariness have vowed to appeal no more; for our\r\n     petitions, say they, by the tens of thousands, are piled up in\r\n     the national archives, unheeded and ignored. Yet it is possible\r\n     to roll up such a mammoth petition, borne into congress on the\r\n     shoulders of stalwart men, that we can no longer be neglected or\r\n     forgotten. Statesmen and politicians alike are conquered by\r\n     majorities. We urge the women of this country to make now the\r\n     same united effort for their own rights that they did for the\r\n     slaves at the South when the thirteenth amendment was pending.\r\n     Then a petition of over 300,000 was rolled up by the leaders of\r\n     the suffrage movement, and presented in the Senate by the Hon.\r\n     Charles Sumner. But the statesmen who welcomed woman's untiring\r\n     efforts to secure the black man's freedom, frowned down the same\r\n     demands when made for herself. Is not liberty as sweet to her as\r\n     to him? Are not the political disabilities of sex as grievous as\r\n     those of color? Is not a civil-rights bill that shall open to\r\n     woman the college doors, the trades and professions--that shall\r\n     secure her personal and property rights, as necessary for her\r\n     protection as for that of the colored man? And yet the highest\r\n     judicial authorities have decided that the spirit and letter of\r\n     our national constitution are not broad enough to protect woman\r\n     in her political rights; and for the redress of her wrongs they\r\n     remand her to the State. If our _Magna Charta_ of human rights\r\n     can be thus narrowed by judicial interpretations in favor of\r\n     class legislation, then must we demand an amendment that, in\r\n     clear, unmistakable language, shall declare the equality of all\r\n     citizens before the law.\r\n\r\n     Women are citizens, first of the United States, and second of the\r\n     State wherein they reside; hence, if robbed by State authorities\r\n     of any right founded in nature or secured by law, they have the\r\n     same right to national protection against the State, as against\r\n     the infringements of any foreign power. If the United States\r\n     government can punish a woman for voting in one State, why has it\r\n     not the same power to protect her in the exercise of that right\r\n     in every State? The constitution declares it the duty of congress\r\n     to guarantee to every State a republican form of government, to\r\n     every citizen, equality of rights. This is not done in States\r\n     where women, thoroughly qualified, are denied admission into\r\n     colleges which their property is taxed to build and endow; where\r\n     they are denied the right to practice law and are thus debarred\r\n     from one of the most lucrative professions; where they are denied\r\n     a voice in the government, and thus, while suffering all the ills\r\n     that grow out of the giant evils of intemperance, prostitution,\r\n     war, heavy taxation and political corruption, stand powerless to\r\n     effect any reform. Prayers, tears, psalm-singing and\r\n     expostulation are light in the balance compared with that power\r\n     at the ballot-box that coins opinions into law. If women who are\r\n     laboring for peace, temperance, social purity and the rights of\r\n     labor, would take the speediest way to accomplish what they\r\n     propose, let them demand the ballot in their own hands, that they\r\n     may have a direct power in the government. Thus only can they\r\n     improve the conditions of the outside world and purify the home.\r\n     As political equality is the door to civil, religious and social\r\n     liberty, here must our work begin.\r\n\r\n     Constituting, as we do, one-half the people, bearing the burdens\r\n     of one-half the national debt, equally responsible with man for\r\n     the education, religion and morals of the rising generation, let\r\n     us with united voice send forth a protest against the present\r\n     political status of woman, that shall echo and reecho through the\r\n     land. In view of the numbers and character of those making the\r\n     demand, this should be the largest petition ever yet rolled up in\r\n     the old world or the new; a petition that shall settle forever\r\n     the popular objection that \"women do not want to vote.\"\r\n\r\n                                  ELIZABETH CADY STANTON, _President._\r\n     MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, _Chairman Executive Committee._\r\n     SUSAN B. ANTHONY, _Corresponding Secretary._\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Tenafly, N. J._, November 10, 1876.\r\n\r\n          _To the Senate and House of Representatives in Congress\r\n          assembled:_\r\n\r\n          The undersigned citizens of the United States, residents of\r\n          the State of ----, earnestly pray your honorable bodies to\r\n          adopt measures for so amending the constitution as to\r\n          prohibit the several States from disfranchising United\r\n          States citizens on account of sex.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the general petition asking for a sixteenth\r\namendment, Matilda Joslyn Gage, this year (1877) sent an individual\r\npetition, similar in form to those offered by disfranchised male\r\ncitizens, asking to be relieved from her political disabilities.\r\nThis petition was presented by Hon. Elias W. Leavenworth, of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, member from the thirty-third New York\r\ncongressional district. It read as follows:\r\n\r\n     _To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States\r\n     in Congress assembled:_\r\n\r\n     Matilda Joslyn Gage, a native born citizen of the United States,\r\n     and of the State of New York, wherein she resides, most earnestly\r\n     petitions your honorable body for the removal of her political\r\n     disabilities and that she may be declared invested with full\r\n     power to exercise her right of self government at the ballot-box,\r\n     all State constitutions, or statute laws to the contrary\r\n     notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nThe above petition was presented January 24, and the following bill\r\nintroduced February 5:\r\n\r\n     AN ACT _to relieve the political disabilities of Matilda Joslyn\r\n     Gage_:\r\n\r\n     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\n     United States of America in congress assembled, that all\r\n     political disabilities heretofore existing in reference to\r\n     Matilda Joslyn Gage, of Fayetteville, Onondaga county, State of\r\n     New York, be removed and she be declared a citizen of the United\r\n     States, clothed with all the political rights and powers of\r\n     citizenship, namely: the right to vote and to hold office to the\r\n     same extent and in the same degree that male citizens enjoy these\r\n     rights. This act to take effect immediately.\r\n\r\nThe following year a large number of similar petitions were sent\r\nfrom different parts of the country, the National Association\r\ndistributing printed forms to its members in the various States.\r\nThe power of congress to thus enfranchise women upon their\r\nindividual petitions is as undoubted as the power to grant\r\nindividual amnesty, to remove the political disabilities of men\r\ndisfranchised for crime against United States laws, or to clothe\r\nforeigners, honorably discharged from the army, with the ballot.\r\n\r\nThe first convention[20] after the all-engrossing events of the\r\ncentennial celebration assembled in Lincoln Hall, Washington,\r\nJanuary 16, with a good array of speakers, Mrs. Stanton presiding.\r\nAfter an inspiring song by the Hutchinsons and reports from the\r\nvarious States, Sara Andrews Spencer, chairman of the congressional\r\ncommittee, gave some encouraging facts in regard to the large\r\nnumber of petitions being presented to congress daily, and read\r\nmany interesting letters from those who had been active in their\r\ncirculation. Over 10,000 were presented during this last session of\r\nthe forty-fourth congress. At the special request of the chairman,\r\nSenator Morton of Indiana, they were referred to the Committee on\r\nPrivileges and Elections; heretofore they had always been placed in\r\nthe hands of the Judiciary Committee in both Senate and House. A\r\nlist of committees[21] was reported by Mrs. Gage which was adopted.\r\nMrs. Swisshelm of Pennsylvania, was introduced. She said:\r\n\r\n     In 1846 she inherited an estate from her parents, and then she\r\n     learned the injustice of the husband holding the wife's property.\r\n     In 1848, however, she got a law passed giving equal rights to\r\n     both men and women, and everybody decried her for the injury she\r\n     had done to all homes by thus throwing the apple of discord into\r\n     families. So in Pennsylvania women now hold property absolutely,\r\n     and can sell without the consent of the husband. But actually no\r\n     woman is free. As in the days of slavery the master owned the\r\n     services, not the body of his slaves, so it is with the wife. The\r\n     husband owns the services and all that can be earned by his wife.\r\n     It is quite possible, as things now stand, to legislate a woman\r\n     out of her home, and yet she cooks, and bakes, and works, and\r\n     saves, but it all belongs to the man, and if she dies the second\r\n     wife gets it all, for she always manages him. The extravagance of\r\n     dress is due alone to-day to the fact that from what woman saves\r\n     in her own expenses and those of her house she gets no benefit at\r\n     all, nor do her children, for it goes to the second wife, who,\r\n     perhaps, turns the children out of doors.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions called out a prolonged discussion, especially the\r\none on compulsory education, and that finally passed with a few\r\ndissenting voices:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS one-half of the citizens of the republic being\r\n     disfranchised are everywhere subjects of legislative caprice, and\r\n     may be anywhere robbed of their most sacred rights; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is the duty of the Congress of the United\r\n     States to submit a proposition for a sixteenth amendment to the\r\n     national constitution prohibiting the several States from\r\n     disfranchising citizens on account of sex.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS a monarchial government lives only through the ignorance\r\n     of the masses, and a republican government can live only through\r\n     the intelligence of the people; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is the duty of Congress to submit to the\r\n     State legislatures propositions to so amend the Constitution of\r\n     the United States as to make education compulsory, and to make\r\n     intelligence a qualification for citizenship and suffrage in the\r\n     United States; said amendments to take effect January 1, 1880,\r\n     when all citizens of legal age, without distinction of sex, who\r\n     can read and write the English language, may be admitted to\r\n     citizenship.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS a century of experience has proven that the safety and\r\n     stability of free institutions and the protection of all United\r\n     States citizens in the exercise of their inalienable rights and\r\n     the proper expression of the will of the whole people, are not\r\n     guaranteed by the present form of the Constitution of the United\r\n     States; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is the duty of the several States to call a\r\n     national convention to revise the Constitution of the United\r\n     States, which, notwithstanding its fifteen amendments, does not\r\n     establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, promote the\r\n     general welfare, nor secure the blessings of liberty to us and to\r\n     our posterity.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the thanks of the women of this nation are due\r\n     to the Rev. Isaac M. See, of the Presbytery of Newark, for his\r\n     noble stand in behalf of woman's right to preach.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the action of the Presbytery of Newark in\r\n     condemning the Rev. I. M. See for his liberal course is an\r\n     indication of the tyranny of the clergy over the consciences of\r\n     women, and a determination to fetter the spirit of freedom.\r\n\r\nAmong the many letters to the convention we give the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   BOSTON, 16th January, 1877.\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIEND: These lines will not reach you in time to be of use.\r\n     I am sorry. But absence and cares must apologize for me. I think\r\n     you are on the right track--the best method to agitate the\r\n     question; and I am with you. I mean always to help everywhere and\r\n     every one.\r\n\r\n                                             WENDELL PHILLIPS.\r\n     Miss ANTHONY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MANCHESTER, Eng., January 3, 1877.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MISS ANTHONY: It is with great pleasure that I write a\r\n     word of sympathy and encouragement, on the occasion of your Ninth\r\n     Annual Convention of the National Woman Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n     Beyond wishing you a successful gathering, I will say nothing\r\n     about the movement in the United States. Women of either country\r\n     can do nothing directly in promoting the movement in the other;\r\n     and if they attempt to do so, there is danger that they may\r\n     hinder and embarrass those who are bearing the burden and heat of\r\n     the day. The only way in which mutual help can be given is\r\n     through the women of each nation working to gain ground in their\r\n     own country. Then, every step so gained, every actual advance of\r\n     the boundaries of civil and political rights for women is a gain,\r\n     not only to the country which has secured it, but to the cause of\r\n     human freedom all over the world.\r\n\r\n     This year marks the decennial of the movement in the United\r\n     Kingdom. In the current number of our journal, there is a sketch\r\n     of the political history of the movement here, which I commend to\r\n     the attention of your convention, and which I need not repeat.\r\n     The record will be seen to be one of great and rapid advance in\r\n     the political rights of women, but there has been an equally\r\n     marked change in other directions; women's interests in\r\n     education, and women's questions generally, are treated now with\r\n     much more respectful consideration than they were ten years ago.\r\n     We are gratified in believing that much of this consideration is\r\n     due to the attention roused by our energetic and persistent\r\n     demand for the suffrage, and in believing that infinitely greater\r\n     benefits of the same kind will accrue when women shall be in\r\n     possession of the franchise. Beyond the material gains in\r\n     legislation, we find a general improvement in the tone of feeling\r\n     and thought toward women--an approach, indeed, to the sentiment\r\n     recently expressed by Victor Hugo, that as man was the problem of\r\n     the eighteenth century, woman is the problem of the nineteenth\r\n     century. May our efforts to solve this problem lead to a happy\r\n     issue.\r\n\r\n                                   Yours truly,\r\n                                             LYDIA E. BECKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   BOSTON, Mass., January 10, 1877.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MRS. STANTON: It is with some little pain, I confess, that I\r\n     accept your very courteous invitation to write a letter for your\r\n     Washington convention on the 19th instant; for what I must say,\r\n     if I say anything at all, is what I know will be very\r\n     unacceptable--I fear very displeasing--to the majority of those\r\n     to whom you will read it. If you conclude that my letter will\r\n     obstruct, and not facilitate the advancement of the cause you\r\n     have so faithfully labored for these many years, you have my most\r\n     cheerful consent to deliver it over to that general asylum of\r\n     profitless productions--the waste-basket.\r\n\r\n     Running this risk, however, I have this brief message to send to\r\n     those who now meet on behalf of woman's full recognition as\r\n     politically the equal of man, namely: that every woman suffragist\r\n     who upholds Christianity, tears down with one hand what she seeks\r\n     to build up with the other--that the Bible sanctions the slavery\r\n     principle itself, and applies it to woman as the divinely\r\n     ordained subordinate of man--and that by making herself the great\r\n     support and mainstay of instituted Christianity, woman rivets the\r\n     chain of superstition on her own soul and on man's soul alike,\r\n     and justifies him in obeying this religion by keeping her in\r\n     subjection to himself. If Christianity and the Bible are true,\r\n     woman is man's servant, and ought to be. The Bible gave to\r\n     negro-slavery its most terrible power--that of summoning the\r\n     consciences of the Christians to its defense; and the Bible gives\r\n     to woman-slavery the same terrible power. So plain is this to me\r\n     that I take it as a mere matter of course, when all the eloquence\r\n     of the woman-suffrage platform fails to arouse the Christian\r\n     women of this country to a proper assertion of their rights. What\r\n     else could one expect? Women will remain contented subjects and\r\n     subordinates just so long as they remain devoted believers in\r\n     Christianity; and no amount of argument, or appeal, or agitation\r\n     can change this fact. If you cannot educate women as a whole out\r\n     of Christianity, you cannot educate them as a whole into the\r\n     demand for equal rights.\r\n\r\n     The reason of this is short: Christianity teaches the rights of\r\n     God, not the rights of man or woman. You may search the Bible\r\n     from Genesis to Revelations, and not find one clear, strong, bold\r\n     affirmation of _human rights as such_; yet it is on human rights\r\n     as such--on the equality of all individuals, man or woman, with\r\n     respect to natural rights--that the demand for woman suffrage\r\n     must ultimately rest. I know I stand nearly alone in this, but I\r\n     believe from my soul that the woman movement is fundamentally\r\n     _anti-Christian_, and can find no deep justification but in the\r\n     ideas, the spirit, and the faith of free religion. Until women\r\n     come to see this too, and to give their united influence to this\r\n     latter faith, political power in their hands would destroy even\r\n     that measure of liberty which free-thinkers of both sexes have\r\n     painfully established by the sacrifices of many generations. Yet\r\n     I should vote for woman suffrage all the same, because it is\r\n     woman's right.\r\n\r\n                              Yours very cordially,\r\n                                                FRANCIS E. ABBOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   WASHINGTON, D. C., January 16, 1877.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIENDS: I thank you for your generous recognition of me\r\n     as an humble co-worker in the cause of equal rights, and regret\r\n     deeply my inability to be present at this anniversary of your\r\n     association. I tender to you, however, my hearty congratulations\r\n     on the marked progress of our cause. Wherever I have been, and\r\n     with whomsoever I have talked, making equal rights invariably the\r\n     subject, I find no opposing feeling to the simple and just\r\n     demands we make for our cause. The chief difficulty in the way is\r\n     the indifference of the people; they need an awakening. Some\r\n     Stephen S. Foster or Anna Dickinson should come forward, and with\r\n     their thunder and lightning, arouse the people from their deadly\r\n     apathy. I am glad to know that you are to have with you our\r\n     valued friend, E. M. Davis, of Philadelphia. We are indebted to\r\n     him more than all besides for whatever of life is found in the\r\n     movement in Pennsylvania. He has spared neither time, money, nor\r\n     personal efforts. Hoping you will have abundant success, I am,\r\n     dear friends, with you and the cause for which you have so nobly\r\n     labored, a humble and sincere worker.\r\n\r\n                                             ROBERT PURVIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   OAKLAND, Cal., January 9, 1877.\r\n\r\n     _To the National Suffrage Convention, Washington, D. C.:_\r\n\r\n     Our incorporated State society has deputed Mrs. Ellen Clark\r\n     Sargent, the wife of Hon. A. A. Sargent, our fearless champion in\r\n     the United States Senate, to represent the women of California in\r\n     your National Convention, and with one so faithful and earnest,\r\n     we know our cause will be well represented; but there are many\r\n     among us who would gladly have journeyed to Washington to\r\n     participate in your councils. Many and radical changes have taken\r\n     place in the past year favorable to our sex, not the least of\r\n     which was the nomination and election of several women to the\r\n     office of county superintendent of common schools, by both the\r\n     Democratic and Republican parties, in which, however, the\r\n     Democrats led. Important changes in the civil code favorable to\r\n     the control of property by married women, have been made by the\r\n     legislatures during the last four years, through the untiring\r\n     efforts of Mrs. Sarah Wallis, Mrs. Knox and Mrs. Watson, of Santa\r\n     Clara county. In our schools and colleges, in every avenue of\r\n     industry, and in the general liberalization of public opinion\r\n     there has been marked improvement.\r\n\r\n                    Yours very truly,\r\n                        LAURA DEFORCE GORDON,\r\n                            _Pres. California W. S. S._ (Incorporated).\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton's letter to _The Ballot-Box_ briefly sums up the\r\nproceedings of the convention:\r\n\r\n                                   TENAFLY, N. J., January 24, 1877.\r\n\r\n     DEAR EDITOR: If the little _Ballot-Box_ is not already stuffed to\r\n     repletion with reports from Washington, I crave a little space to\r\n     tell your readers that the convention was in all points\r\n     successful. Lincoln Hall, which seats about fifteen hundred\r\n     people, was crowded every session. The speaking was good, order\r\n     reigned, no heart-burnings behind the scenes, and the press\r\n     vouchsafed \"respectful consideration.\"\r\n\r\n     The resolutions you will find more interesting and suggestive\r\n     than that kind of literature usually is, and I ask especial\r\n     attention to the one for a national convention to revise the\r\n     constitution, which, with all its amendments, is like a kite with\r\n     a tail of infinite length still to be lengthened. It is evident a\r\n     century of experience has so liberalized the minds of the\r\n     American people, that they have outgrown the constitution adapted\r\n     to the men of 1776. It is a monarchial document with republican\r\n     ideas engrafted in it, full of compromises between antagonistic\r\n     principles. An American statesman remarked that \"The civil war\r\n     was fought to expound the constitution on the question of\r\n     slavery.\" Expensive expounding! Instead of further amending and\r\n     expounding, the real work at the dawn of our second century is to\r\n     make a new one. Again, I ask the attention of our women to the\r\n     educational resolution. After much thought it seems to me we\r\n     should have education compulsory in every State of the Union, and\r\n     make it the basis of suffrage, a national law, requiring that\r\n     those who vote after 1880 must be able to read and write the\r\n     English language. This would prevent ignorant foreigners voting\r\n     in six months after landing on our shores, and stimulate our\r\n     native population to higher intelligence. It would dignify and\r\n     purify the ballot-box and add safety and stability to our free\r\n     institutions. Mrs. Jane Grey Swisshelm, who had just returned\r\n     from Europe, attended the convention, and spoke on this subject.\r\n\r\n     Belva A. Lockwood, who had recently been denied admission to the\r\n     Supreme Court of the United States, although a lawyer in good\r\n     practice for three years in the Supreme Court of the District,\r\n     made a very scathing speech, reviewing the decision of the Court.\r\n     It may seem to your disfranchised readers quite presumptuous for\r\n     one of their number to make those nine wise men on the bench,\r\n     constituting the highest judicial authority in the United States,\r\n     subjects for ridicule before an audience of the sovereign people;\r\n     but, when they learn the decision in Mrs. Lockwood's case, they\r\n     will be reassured as to woman's capacity to cope with their\r\n     wisdom. \"To arrive at the same conclusion, with these judges, it\r\n     is not necessary,\" said Mrs. Lockwood, \"to understand\r\n     constitutional law, nor the history of English jurisprudence, nor\r\n     the inductive or deductive modes of reasoning, as no such\r\n     profound learning or processes of thought were involved in that\r\n     decision, which was simply this: 'There is no precedent for\r\n     admitting a woman to practice in the Supreme Court of the United\r\n     States, hence Mrs. Lockwood's application cannot be considered.'\"\r\n\r\n     On this point Mrs. Lockwood showed that it was the glory of each\r\n     generation to make its own precedents. As there was none for Eve\r\n     in the garden of Eden, she argued there need be none for her\r\n     daughters on entering the college, the church, or the courts.\r\n     Blackstone--of whose works she inferred the judges were\r\n     ignorant--gives several precedents for women in the English\r\n     courts. As Mrs. Lockwood--tall, well-proportioned, with dark hair\r\n     and eyes, regular features, in velvet dress and train, with\r\n     becoming indignation at such injustice--marched up and down the\r\n     platform and rounded out her glowing periods, she might have\r\n     fairly represented the Italian Portia at the bar of Venice. No\r\n     more effective speech was ever made on our platform.\r\n\r\n     Matilda Joslyn Gage, whose speeches are always replete with\r\n     historical research, reviewed the action of the Republican party\r\n     toward woman from the introduction of the word \"male\" into the\r\n     fourteenth amendment of the constitution down to the celebration\r\n     of our national birthday in Philadelphia, when the declaration of\r\n     the mothers was received in contemptuous silence, while Dom Pedro\r\n     and other foreign dignitaries looked calmly on. Mrs. Gage makes\r\n     as dark a chapter for the Republicans as Mrs. Lockwood for the\r\n     judiciary, or Mrs. Blake for the church. Mrs. B. had been an\r\n     attentive listener during the trial of the Rev. Isaac See before\r\n     the presbytery of Newark, N. J., hence she felt moved to give the\r\n     convention a chapter of ecclesiastical history, showing the\r\n     struggles through which the church was passing with the\r\n     irrepressible woman in the pulpit. Mrs. Blake's biblical\r\n     interpretations and expositions proved conclusively that Scott's\r\n     and Clark's commentaries would at no distant day be superceded by\r\n     standard works from woman's standpoint. It is not to be supposed\r\n     that women ever can have fair play as long as men only write and\r\n     interpret the Scriptures and make and expound the laws. Why would\r\n     it not be a good idea for women to leave these conservative\r\n     gentlemen alone in the churches? How sombre they would look with\r\n     the flowers, feathers, bright ribbons and shawls all gone--black\r\n     coats only kneeling and standing--and with the deep-toned organ\r\n     swelling up, the solemn bass voice heard only in awful solitude;\r\n     not one soprano note to rise above the low, dull wail to fill the\r\n     arched roof with triumphant melody! One such experiment from\r\n     Maine to California would bring these bigoted presbyteries to\r\n     their senses.\r\n\r\n     Miss Phoebe Couzins, too, was at the convention, and gave her new\r\n     lecture, \"A Woman without a Country,\" in which she shows all that\r\n     woman has done--from fitting out ships for Columbus, to sharing\r\n     the toils of the great exposition--without a place of honor in\r\n     the republic for the living, or a statue to the memory of the\r\n     dead. Hon. A. G. Riddle and Francis Miller spoke ably and\r\n     eloquently as usual; the former on the sixteenth amendment and\r\n     the presidential aspect, modestly suggesting that if twenty\r\n     million women had voted, they might have been able to find out\r\n     for whom the majority had cast their ballots. Mr. Miller\r\n     recommended State action, advising us to concentrate our forces\r\n     in Colorado as a shorter way to success than constitutional\r\n     amendments.\r\n\r\n     His speech aroused Susan B. Anthony to the boiling point; for, if\r\n     there is anything that exasperates her, it is to be remanded, as\r\n     she says, to John Morrissey's constituency for her rights. She\r\n     contends that if the United States authority could punish her for\r\n     voting in the State of New York, it has the same power to protect\r\n     her there in the exercise of that right. Moreover, she said, we\r\n     have two wings to our movement. The American Association is\r\n     trying the popular-vote method. The National Association is\r\n     trying the constitutional method, which has emancipated and\r\n     enfranchised the African and secured to that race all their civil\r\n     rights. To-day by this method they are in the courts, the\r\n     colleges, and the halls of legislation in every State in the\r\n     Union, while we have puttered with State rights for thirty years\r\n     without a foothold anywhere, except in the territories, and it is\r\n     now proposed to rob the women of their rights in those\r\n     localities. As the two methods do not conflict, and what is done\r\n     in the several States tells on the nation, and what is done by\r\n     congress reacts again on the States, it must be a good thing to\r\n     keep up both kinds of agitation.\r\n\r\n     In the middle of November the National Association sent out\r\n     thousands of petitions and appeals for the sixteenth amendment,\r\n     which were published and commented on extensively by the press in\r\n     every State in the Union. Early in January they began to pour\r\n     into Washington at the rate of a thousand a day, coming from\r\n     twenty-six different States. It does not require much wisdom to\r\n     see that when these petitions were placed in the hands of the\r\n     representatives of their States, a great educational work was\r\n     accomplished at Washington, and public sentiment there has its\r\n     legitimate effect throughout the country, as well as that already\r\n     accomplished in the rural districts by the slower process of\r\n     circulating and signing the petitions. The present uncertain\r\n     position of men and parties, has made politicians more ready to\r\n     listen to the demands of their constituents, and never has woman\r\n     suffrage been treated with more courtesy in Washington.\r\n\r\n     To Sara Andrews Spencer we are indebted, for the great labor of\r\n     receiving, assorting, counting, rolling-up and planning the\r\n     presentation of the petitions. It was by a well considered _coup\r\n     d'etat_ that, with her brave coadjutors, she appeared on the\r\n     floor of the House at the moment of adjournment, and there,\r\n     without circumlocution, gave each member a petition from his own\r\n     State. Even Miss Anthony, always calm in the hour of danger, on\r\n     finding herself suddenly whisked into those sacred enclosures,\r\n     amid a crowd of stalwart men, spittoons, and scrap-baskets, when\r\n     brought _vis-a-vis_ with our champion, Mr. Hoar, hastily\r\n     apologized for the intrusion, to which the honorable gentleman\r\n     promptly replied, \"I hope, Madam, yet to see you on this floor,\r\n     in your own right, and in business hours too.\" Then and there the\r\n     work of the next day was agreed on, the members gladly accepting\r\n     the petitions. As you have already seen, Mr. Hoar made the motion\r\n     for the special order, which was carried and the petitions\r\n     presented. Your readers will be glad to know, that Mr. Hoar has\r\n     just been chosen, by Massachusetts, as her next senator--that\r\n     gives us another champion in the Senate. As there are many\r\n     petitions still in circulation, urge your readers to keep sending\r\n     them until the close of the session, as we want to know how many\r\n     women are in earnest on this question. It is constantly said,\r\n     \"Women do not want to vote.\" Ten thousand told our\r\n     representatives at Washington in a single day that they did! What\r\n     answer?\r\n\r\n                         Yours sincerely,    ELIZABETH CADY STANTON.\r\n\r\nThe press commented as follows:\r\n\r\n     SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT.--The woman suffragists, who had a benefit in\r\n     the House of Representatives, on Friday, when their petitions\r\n     were presented, transferred their affections to the Senate on\r\n     Saturday to witness the presentation of a large number of\r\n     petitions in that body. It is impossible to tell whether the\r\n     results desired by the women will follow this concerted action,\r\n     but it is certain that they have their forces better organized\r\n     this year than they ever had before, and they have gone to work\r\n     on a more systematic plan.--[_National Republican._\r\n\r\n     SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT IN THE SENATE--THE TEN THOUSAND PETITIONERS\r\n     ROYALLY TREATED.--That women will, by voting, lose nothing of\r\n     man's courteous, chivalric attention and respect is admirably\r\n     proven by the manner in which both houses of congress, in the\r\n     midst of the most anxious and perplexing presidential conflict in\r\n     our history, received their appeals from twenty-three States for\r\n     a sixteenth amendment protecting the rights of women.\r\n\r\n     In both houses, by unanimous consent, the petitions were\r\n     presented and read in open session. The speaker of the House\r\n     gallantly prepared the way yesterday, and the most prominent\r\n     senators to-day improved the occasion by impressing upon the\r\n     Senate the importance of the question. Mr. Sargent reminded the\r\n     senators that there were forty thousand more votes for woman\r\n     suffrage in Michigan than for the new State constitution, and Mr.\r\n     Dawes said, upon presenting the petition from Massachusetts, that\r\n     the question was attracting the attention of both political\r\n     parties in that State, and he commended it to the early and\r\n     earnest consideration of the Senate. Mr. Cockrell of Missouri,\r\n     merrily declared that his petitioners were the most beautiful and\r\n     accomplished daughters of the State, which of course he felt\r\n     compelled to do when Miss Couzins' bright eyes were watching the\r\n     proceedings from the gallery. Mr. Cameron of Pennsylvania,\r\n     suggested that it would have been better to put them all together\r\n     and not consume the time of the Senate with so many\r\n     presentations.\r\n\r\n     The officers of the National Woman Suffrage Association held a\r\n     caucus after the adjournment of the Senate, and decided to thank\r\n     Mr. Cameron for his suggestion, and while they had no anxiety\r\n     lest senators should consume too much time attending to the\r\n     interests of women whom they claim to represent, and might\r\n     reasonably anticipate that ten millions of disfranchised citizens\r\n     would trouble them considerably with petitions while this\r\n     injustice continued, yet they would promptly adopt the senator's\r\n     counsel and roll up such a mammoth petition as the Senate had not\r\n     yet seen from the thousands of women who had no opportunity to\r\n     sign these. Accordingly they immediately prepared the\r\n     announcement for the friends of woman suffrage to send on their\r\n     names to the chairman of the congressional committee. They\r\n     naturally feel greatly encouraged by the evident interest of both\r\n     parties in the proposed sixteenth amendment, and will work with\r\n     renewed strength to secure the cooeperation of the women of the\r\n     country.--[_Washington Star._\r\n\r\n     The time has evidently arrived when demands for a recognition of\r\n     the personal, civil and political rights of\r\n     one-half--unquestionably the better half--of the people cannot be\r\n     laughed down or sneered down, and recent indications are that\r\n     they cannot much longer be voted down. It was quite clear on\r\n     Friday and Saturday, when petitions from the best citizens of\r\n     twenty-three States were presented in House and Senate, that the\r\n     leaders of the two political parties vied with each other in\r\n     doing honor to the grave subject proposed for their\r\n     consideration. The speaker of the House set a commendable example\r\n     of courtesy to women by proposing that the petitions be delivered\r\n     in open House, to which there was no objection. The early\r\n     advocates of equal rights for women--Hoar, Kelley, Banks, Kasson,\r\n     Lawrence, and Lapham--were, if possible, surpassed in courtesy by\r\n     those who are not committed, but are beginning to see that a\r\n     finer element in the body politic would clear the vision, purify\r\n     the atmosphere and help to settle many vexed questions on the\r\n     basis of exact and equal justice.\r\n\r\n     In the Senate the unprecedented courtesy was extended to women of\r\n     half an hour's time on the floor for the presentation of\r\n     petitions, exactly alike in form, from twenty-one States, and\r\n     while this kind of business this session has usually been\r\n     transacted with an attendance of from seven to ten senators, it\r\n     was observed that only two out of twenty-three senators who had\r\n     sixteenth amendment petitions to present were out of their seats.\r\n     Senator Sargent said the presence of women at the polls would\r\n     purify elections and give us a better class of public officials,\r\n     and the State would thus be greatly benefited. The subject was\r\n     receiving serious consideration in this country and in England.\r\n     Senator Dawes, in presenting the petition from Massachusetts,\r\n     said the subject was commanding the attention of both political\r\n     parties in his own State.\r\n\r\n     The officers of the National Association, who had been able to\r\n     give only a few days' time to securing the cooeperation of the\r\n     women of the several States in their present effort, held a\r\n     caucus after the adjournment of the Senate, and decided to\r\n     immediately issue a new appeal for a mammoth petition, which\r\n     would even more decidedly impress the two houses with the\r\n     importance of protecting the rights of women by a constitutional\r\n     amendment. Considering the many long days and weeks consumed in\r\n     both houses in discussing the political rights of the colored\r\n     male citizens, there is an obvious propriety in giving full and\r\n     fair consideration to the protection of the rights of wives,\r\n     mothers and daughters.--[_The National Republican_, January 22,\r\n     1877.\r\n\r\nThe National Association held its anniversary in Masonic Temple,\r\nNew York, May 24, 1877. Isabella Beecher Hooker, vice-president for\r\nConnecticut, called the meeting to order and invited Rev. Olympia\r\nBrown to lead in prayer. Mrs. Gage made the annual report of the\r\nexecutive committee. Dr. Clemence S. Lozier of New York was elected\r\npresident for the coming year. Pledges were made to roll up\r\npetitions with renewed energy; and resolutions were duly\r\ndiscussed[22] and adopted:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Such minor matters as declaring peace and war, the\r\n     coining of money, the imposition of tariff, and the control of\r\n     the postal service, are forbidden the respective States; and\r\n     whereas, upon the framing of the constitution, it was wisely\r\n     held that these property rights would be unsafe under the\r\n     control of thirteen varying deliberative bodies; and whereas, by\r\n     a curious anomaly, power over suffrage, the basis and\r\n     corner-stone of the nation, is held to be under control of the\r\n     respective States; and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, the experience of a century has shown that the personal\r\n     right of self-government inhering in each individual, is wholly\r\n     insecure under the control of thirty-eight varying deliberative\r\n     bodies; and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, the right of self-government by the use of the ballot\r\n     inheres in the citizen of the United States; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is the immediate and most important duty of\r\n     the government to secure this right on a national basis to all\r\n     citizens, independent of sex.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the right of suffrage underlies all other\r\n     rights, and that in working to secure it women are doing the best\r\n     temperance, moral reform, educational, and religious work of the\r\n     age.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we solemnly protest against the recent memorial\r\n     to congress, from Utah, asking the disfranchisement of the women\r\n     of that territory, and that we ask of congress that this request,\r\n     made in violation of the spirit of our institutions, be not\r\n     granted.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the thanks of the National Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association are hereby tendered to the late speaker of the House\r\n     of Representatives, Hon. Samuel J. Randall, Pa.; and to\r\n     Representatives Banks, Mass.; Blair, N. H.: Bland, Mo.; Brown,\r\n     Kan.; Cox, N. Y.; Eames, R. I.; Fenn, Col.; Hale, Me.; Hamilton,\r\n     N.

(a petition from the\r\n     District); Thurman, Ohio (a petition from Kansas); Wadleigh, N.\r\n     H.; Wallace, Pa.; Windom, Minn.; Wright, Iowa, for representing\r\n     the women of the United States in the presentation of the\r\n     sixteenth amendment petitions from ten thousand citizens, in open\r\n     House and Senate, at the last session of congress.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That while we recognize with gratitude the opening of\r\n     many new avenues of labor and usefulness to women, and the\r\n     amelioration of their condition before the law in many States, we\r\n     still declare there can be no fair play for women in the world of\r\n     business until they stand on the same plane of citizenship with\r\n     their masculine competitors.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That in entering the professions and other\r\n     departments of business heretofore occupied largely by men, the\r\n     women of to-day should desire to accept the same conditions and\r\n     tests of excellence with their brothers, and should demand the\r\n     same standard for men and women in business, art, education, and\r\n     morals.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the thanks of this association are hereby\r\n     tendered to the Hon. Geo. F. Hoar of Massachusetts, for rising in\r\n     his place in the Cincinnati presidential convention, and asking\r\n     in behalf of the disfranchised women of the United States that\r\n     the convention grant a hearing to Mrs. Spencer, of Washington,\r\n     the accredited delegate of the National Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association.\r\n\r\nGreat unanimity was reached in these sentiments and the enthusiasm\r\nmanifested gave promise of earnest labor and more hopeful results.\r\nIt was felt that there was reason to thank God and take courage.\r\n\r\nThe day before the opening of the Tenth Washington Convention a\r\ncaucus was held in the ladies' reception-room[23] in the Senate\r\nwing of the capitol. A roll-call of the delegates developed the\r\nfact that every State in the Union would be represented by women\r\nnow here and _en route_, or by letter. Mrs. Spencer said she had\r\nmade a request in the proper quarter, that the delegates should be\r\nallowed to go on the floor when the Senate was actually in session,\r\nand present their case to the senators. She had been met with the\r\nstatement that such a proceeding was without precedent. Mrs. Hooker\r\nsuggested that inasmuch as there was a precedent for such a course\r\nin the House, the delegates should meet the following Thursday to\r\ncanvass for votes in the House of Representatives. Another delegate\r\nrecalled the fact that Mrs. General Sherman and Mrs. Admiral\r\nDahlgren had been admitted upon the floor of the Senate while it\r\nwas in session, to canvass for votes against woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nThis agitation resulted in a resolution introduced by Hon. A. A.\r\nSargent, January 10:\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, Thousands of women of the United States have\r\n          petitioned congress for an amendment to the constitution\r\n          allowing women the right of suffrage; and whereas, many of\r\n          the representative women of the country favoring such\r\n          amendment are present in the city and have requested to be\r\n          heard before the Senate in advocacy of said amendment,\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That at a session of the Senate, to be held on\r\n          ----, said representative women, or such of them as may be\r\n          designated for that purpose, may be heard before the Senate;\r\n          but for one hour only.\r\n\r\n     Mr. EDMUNDS demanded the regular order.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SARGENT advocated the resolution, and urged immediate action,\r\n     as delay would detain the women in the city at considerable\r\n     expense to them. He thought the question not so intricate that\r\n     senators require time for consideration whether or not the women\r\n     should be heard.\r\n\r\n     Mr. EDMUNDS said there was a rule of long standing that forbids\r\n     any person appearing before the Senate. There was much to be said\r\n     in favor of the petitions, but it was against the logic of the\r\n     resolution that the petitioners required more than was accorded\r\n     any others. He, therefore, insisted on his demand for the regular\r\n     order.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SARGENT gave notice that he would call up his resolution\r\n     to-morrow, and reminded the senators that no rule was so sacred\r\n     that it could not be set aside by unanimous consent.\r\n\r\nOn the next day there was a lively discussion, Senators Edmunds,\r\nThurman and Conkling insisting there was no precedent; Mr. Sargent,\r\nassisted by Senators Burnside, Anthony and Dawes, reminding them\r\nof several occasions when the Senate had extended similar\r\ncourtesies. The resolution was voted down--31 to 13.[24]\r\n\r\nHon. Wm. D. Kelly, of Pennsylvania, performed like service in the\r\nHouse:\r\n\r\n     Mr. KELLY asked leave to offer a resolution, reciting that\r\n     petitions were about to be presented to the House of\r\n     Representatives from citizens of thirty-five States of the Union,\r\n     asking for the adoption of an amendment to the constitution to\r\n     prohibit the disfranchisement of any citizen of any State; and\r\n     that there be a session of the House on Saturday, January 12, at\r\n     which time the advocates of the constitutional amendment may be\r\n     heard at the bar. These petitions ask the House to originate a\r\n     movement which it cannot consumate, but which it can only submit\r\n     to the States for their action. The resolution only asks that the\r\n     House will hear a limited number of the advocates of this\r\n     amendment, who are now in the city, and on a day when there is\r\n     not likely to be a session for business. They only ask the\r\n     privilege of stating the grounds of their belief why the\r\n     constitution should be amended in the direction they indicate.\r\n     Many of these ladies who petition are tax-payers, and they\r\n     believe their rights have been infringed upon.\r\n\r\n     Mr. CRITTENDEN of Missouri, objected, and the resolution was not\r\n     entertained.\r\n\r\nThis refusal to women pleading for their own freedom was the more\r\nnoticeable, as not only had Mesdames Sherman and Dahlgren been\r\nheard upon the floor of the Senate in opposition, but the floor of\r\nthe House was shortly after granted to Charles Stewart Parnell, M.\r\nP., that he might plead the cause of oppressed Ireland. The\r\nWashington _Union_ of January 11, 1878, largely sustained by\r\nfederal patronage, commented as follows:\r\n\r\n     To allow the advocates of woman suffrage to plead their cause on\r\n     the floor of the Senate, as proposed yesterday by Mr. Sargent,\r\n     would be a decided innovation upon the established usages of\r\n     parliamentary bodies. If the privilege were granted in this case\r\n     it would next be claimed by the friends and the enemies of the\r\n     silver bill, by the supporters and opponents of resumption, by\r\n     hard money men and soft money men, by protectionists and\r\n     free-traders, by labor-reformers, prohibitionists and the Lord\r\n     knows whom besides. In fact, the admission of the ladies to speak\r\n     on the floor of the Senate would be the beginning of lively times\r\n     in that body.\r\n\r\nThe convention was held in Lincoln Hall, January, 8, 9, 1878. The\r\nhouse was filled to overflowing at the first session. A large\r\nnumber of representative women occupied the platform.[25] In\r\nopening the meeting the president, Dr. Clemence Lozier, gave a\r\nresume of the progress of the cause. Mrs. Stanton made an argument\r\non \"National Protection for National Citizens.\"[26] Mrs. Lockwood\r\npresented the following resolutions, which called out an amusing\r\ndebate on the \"man idea\"--that he can best represent the home, the\r\nchurch, the State, the industries, etc., etc.:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the president of this convention appoint a\r\n     committee to select three intelligent women who shall be paid\r\n     commissioners to the Paris exposition; and also six other women\r\n     who shall be volunteer commissioners to said exposition to\r\n     represent the industries of American women.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That to further this object the committee be\r\n     instructed to confer with the President, the Secretary of State,\r\n     and Commissioner McCormick.\r\n\r\nA committee was appointed[27] and at once repaired to the\r\nwhite-house, where they were pleasantly received by President\r\nHayes. After learning the object of their visit, the president\r\nnamed the different classes of industries for which no\r\ncommissioners had been appointed, asked the ladies to nominate\r\ntheir candidates, and assured them he would favor a representation\r\nby women.\r\n\r\n     Miss JULIA SMITH of Glastonbury, Conn., the veteran defender of\r\n     the maxim of our fathers, \"no taxation without representation,\"\r\n     narrated the experience of herself and her sister Abby with the\r\n     tax-gatherers. They attended the town-meeting and protested\r\n     against unjust taxation, but finally their cows went into the\r\n     treasury to satisfy the tax-collector.\r\n\r\n     ELIZABETH BOYNTON HARBERT of the Chicago _Inter-Ocean_, spoke on\r\n     the temperance work being done in Chicago, in connection with the\r\n     advocacy of the sixteenth amendment.\r\n\r\n     LILLIE DEVEREUX BLAKE reviewed the work in New York in getting\r\n     the bill through the legislature to appoint women on school\r\n     boards, which was finally vetoed by Governor Robinson.\r\n\r\n     Dr. MARY THOMPSON of Oregon, and Mrs. CROMWELL of Arkansas, gave\r\n     interesting reports from their States, relating many laughable\r\n     encounters with the opposition.\r\n\r\n     ROBERT PURVIS of Philadelphia, read a letter from the suffragists\r\n     of Pennsylvania, in which congratulations were extended to the\r\n     convention.\r\n\r\n     MARY A. S. CAREY, a worthy representative of the District of\r\n     Columbia, the first colored woman that ever edited a newspaper in\r\n     the United States, and who had been a worker in the cause for\r\n     twenty years, expressed her views on the question, and said the\r\n     colored women would support whatever party would allow them their\r\n     rights, be it Republican or Democratic.\r\n\r\n     Rev. OLYMPIA BROWN believed that a proper interpretation of the\r\n     fourteenth and fifteenth amendments did confer suffrage on women.\r\n     But men don't so understand it, and as a consequence when Mahomet\r\n     would not come to the mountain the mountain must go to Mahomet.\r\n     She said the day was coming, and rapidly, too, when women would\r\n     be given suffrage. There were very few now who did not\r\n     acknowledge the justice of it.\r\n\r\n     ISABELLA BEECHER HOOKER gave her idea on \"A Reconstructed\r\n     Police,\" showing how she would rule a police force if in her\r\n     control. Commencing with the location of the office, she\r\n     proceeded with her list of feminine and masculine officers, the\r\n     chief being herself. She would have a superintendent as aid, with\r\n     cooerdinate powers, and, besides the police force proper, which\r\n     she would form of men and women in equal proportions; she would\r\n     have matrons in charge of all station-houses. Her treatment of\r\n     vagrants would be to wash, feed, and clothe them, make them\r\n     stitch, wash and iron, take their history down for future\r\n     reference, and finally turn them out as skilled laborers. The\r\n     care of vagrant children would form an item in her system.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. LAWRENCE of Massachusetts, said the country is in danger,\r\n     and like other republics, unless taken care of, will perish by\r\n     its own vices. She said twelve hundred thousand men and women of\r\n     this country now stand with nothing to do, because their\r\n     legislators of wealth were working not for the many, but the few,\r\n     drunkenness and vice being superinduced by such a state of\r\n     things. She insisted that women were to blame for much of the\r\n     evil of the world--for bringing into life children who grow up in\r\n     vice from their inborn tendencies.\r\n\r\n     Dr. CAROLINE B. WINSLOW of Washington, referred to the speech of\r\n     Mrs. Lawrence, saying she hoped God would bless her for having\r\n     the courage to speak as she did. There is no greater reform than\r\n     for man and woman to be true to the marital relations.\r\n\r\n     BELVA A. LOCKWOOD said the only way for women to get their rights\r\n     is to take them. If necessary let there be a domestic\r\n     insurrection. Let young women refuse to marry, and married women\r\n     refuse to sew on buttons, cook, and rock the cradle until their\r\n     liege-lords acknowledge the rights they are entitled to. There\r\n     were more ways than one to conquer a man; and women, like the\r\n     strikers in the railroad riots, should carry their demands all\r\n     along the line. She dwelt at length upon the refusal of the\r\n     courts in allowing Lavinia Dundore to become a constable, and\r\n     asked why she should not be appointed.\r\n\r\n     The Rev. OLYMPIA BROWN said that if they wanted wisdom and\r\n     prosperity in the nation, health and happiness in the home, they\r\n     must give woman the power to purify her surroundings; the right\r\n     to make the outside world fit for her children to live in. Who\r\n     are more interested than mothers in the sanitary condition of our\r\n     schools and streets, and in the moral atmosphere of our towns and\r\n     cities?\r\n\r\n     Marshal FREDERICK DOUGLASS said his reluctance to come forward\r\n     was not due to any lack of interest in the subject under\r\n     discussion. For thirty years he had believed in human rights to\r\n     all men and women. Nothing that has ever been proposed involved\r\n     such vital interests as the subject which now invites attention.\r\n     When the negro was freed the question was asked if he was capable\r\n     of voting intelligently. It was answered in this way: that if a\r\n     sober negro knows as much as a drunken white man he is capable of\r\n     exercising the elective franchise.\r\n\r\n     LAVINIA C. DUNDORE, introduced as the lady who had made\r\n     application for an appointment as a constable and been refused,\r\n     made a pithy address, in which she alluded to her recent\r\n     disappointment.\r\n\r\n     MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE spoke of the influence of the church on\r\n     woman's liberties, and then referred to a large number of law\r\n     books--ancient and modern, ecclesiastical and lay--in which the\r\n     liberties of woman were more or less abridged; the equality of\r\n     sexes which obtained in Rome before the Christian era, and the\r\n     gradual discrimination in favor of men which crept in with the\r\n     growth of the church.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. DEVEREUX BLAKE said there is no aspect of this question that\r\n     strikes us so forcibly as the total ignoring of women by public\r\n     men. However polite they may be in private life, when they come\r\n     to public affairs they seem to forget that women exist. The men\r\n     who framed the last amendment to the constitution seemed to have\r\n     wholly forgotten that women existed or had rights.... Huxley said\r\n     in reply to an inquiry as to woman suffrage, \"Of course I'm in\r\n     favor of it. Does it become us to lay additional burdens on those\r\n     who are already overweighted?\" It is always the little men who\r\n     oppose us; the big-hearted men help us along. All in this\r\n     audience are of the broad-shouldered type, and I hope all will go\r\n     out prepared to advocate our principles. In reply to the\r\n     objection that women do not need the right to vote because men\r\n     represent them so well, she asked if any man in the audience ever\r\n     asked his wife how he should vote, and told him to stand up if\r\n     there was such a one. [Here a young man in the back part of the\r\n     hall stood up amidst loud applause.]\r\n\r\nThe various resolutions were discussed at great length and adopted,\r\nthough much difference of opinion was expressed on the last, which\r\ndemands that intelligence shall be made the basis of suffrage:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the National Constitution should be so amended\r\n     as to secure to United States citizens at home the same\r\n     protection for their individual rights against State tyranny, as\r\n     is now guaranteed everywhere against foreign aggressions.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the civil and political rights of the educated\r\n     tax-paying women of this nation should take precedence of all\r\n     propositions and debates in the present congress as to the future\r\n     status of the Chinese and Indians under the flag of the United\r\n     States.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The essential elements of justice are already recognized\r\n     in the constitution; and, whereas, our fathers proposed to\r\n     establish a purely secular government in which all forms of\r\n     religion should be equally protected, therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is preeminently unjust to tax the property of\r\n     widows and spinsters to its full value, while the clergy are made\r\n     a privileged class by exempting from taxation $1,500 of their\r\n     property in some States, while in all States parsonages and other\r\n     church property, amounting to millions of dollars, are exempted,\r\n     which, if fairly taxed, would greatly lighten the national debt,\r\n     and thereby the burdens of the laboring masses.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That thus to exempt one class of citizens, one kind\r\n     of property, from taxation, at the expense of all others, is a\r\n     great national evil, in a moral as well as a financial point of\r\n     view. It is an assumption that the church is a more important\r\n     institution than the family; that the influence of the clergy is\r\n     of more vital consequence in the progress of civilization than\r\n     that of the women of this republic; from which we emphatically\r\n     dissent.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That universal education is the true basis of\r\n     universal suffrage; hence the several States should so amend\r\n     their constitutions as to make education compulsory, and, as a\r\n     stimulus to the rising generation, declare that after 1885 all\r\n     who exercise the right of suffrage must be able to read and write\r\n     the English language. For, while the national government should\r\n     secure the equal right of suffrage to all citizens, the State\r\n     should regulate its exercise by proper attainable qualifications.\r\n\r\nOn January 10, 1878, our champion in the Senate, Hon. A. A.\r\nSargent, of California, by unanimous consent, presented the\r\nfollowing joint resolution, which was read twice and referred to\r\nthe Committee on Privileges and Elections:\r\n\r\n     JOINT RESOLUTION _proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of\r\n     the United States_.--\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_ by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\n     United States of America in congress assembled, two-thirds of\r\n     each House concurring therein, That the following article be\r\n     proposed to the legislatures of the several States as an\r\n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which, when\r\n     ratified by three-fourths of the said legislatures, shall be\r\n     valid as part of the said constitution, namely:\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE 16, SEC. 1.--The right of citizens of the United States\r\n     to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or\r\n     by any State on account of sex.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 2.--Congress shall have power to enforce this article by\r\n     appropriate legislation.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Privileges and Elections granted hearings to the\r\nNational Association on January 11, 12, when the delegates,[28]\r\nrepresenting the several States, made their respective arguments\r\nand appeals. Clemence S. Lozier, M. D., president of the\r\nassociation, first addressed the committee and read the following\r\nextract from a recent letter from Victor Hugo:\r\n\r\n     Our ill-balanced society seems as if it would take from woman all\r\n     that nature had endowed her with. In our codes there is something\r\n     to recast. It is what I call the woman-law. Man has had his law;\r\n     he has made it for himself. Woman has only the law of man. She by\r\n     this law is civilly a minor and morally a slave. Her education is\r\n     embued with this twofold character of inferiority. Hence many\r\n     sufferings to her which man must justly share. There must be\r\n     reform here, and it will be to the benefit of civilization,\r\n     truth, and light.\r\n\r\n     In concluding, Dr. Lozier said: I have now the honor to introduce\r\n     Miss Julia E. Smith, of Glastonbury, Conn., who will speak to you\r\n     concerning the resistance of her sister and herself to the\r\n     payment of taxes in her native town, on the ground that they are\r\n     unrepresented in all town meetings, and therefore have no voice\r\n     in the expenditure of the taxes which they are compelled to pay.\r\n\r\n     Miss SMITH said: _Gentlemen of the Committee_--This is the first\r\n     time in my life that I have trod these halls, and what has\r\n     brought me here? I say, oppression--oppression of women by men.\r\n     Under the law they have taken from us $2,000 worth of\r\n     meadow-land, and sold it for taxes of less than $50, and we were\r\n     obliged to redeem it, for we could not lose the most valuable\r\n     part of our farm. They have come into our house and said, \"You\r\n     must pay so much; we must execute the laws\"; and we are not\r\n     allowed to have a voice in the matter, or to modify laws that are\r\n     odious.\r\n\r\n     I have come to Washington, as men cannot address you for us. We\r\n     have no power at all; we are totally defenseless. [Miss Smith\r\n     then read two short letters written by her sister Abby to the\r\n     Springfield _Republican_.] These tell our brief story, and may I\r\n     not ask, gentlemen, that they shall so plead with you that you\r\n     will report to the Senate unanimously in favor of the sixteenth\r\n     amendment, which we ask in order that the women of these United\r\n     States who shall come after us may be saved the desecration of\r\n     their homes which we have suffered, and our country may be\r\n     relieved from the disgrace of refusing representation to that\r\n     half of its people that men call the better half, because it\r\n     includes their wives and daughters and mothers?\r\n\r\n     ELIZABETH BOYNTON HARBERT, vice-president for Illinois:\r\n     _Gentlemen of the Committee_--We recognize your duty as men\r\n     intrusted with the control and guidance of the government to\r\n     carefully weigh every phase of this momentous question. Has the\r\n     time arrived when it will be safe and expedient to make a\r\n     practical application of these great principles of our government\r\n     to one-half of the governed, one-half of the citizens of the\r\n     United States? The favorite argument of the opposition has been\r\n     that women are represented by men, hence have no cause for\r\n     complaint. Any careful student of the progress of liberty must\r\n     admit that the only possible method for securing justice to the\r\n     represented is for their representatives to be made entirely\r\n     responsible to their constituents, and promptly removable by\r\n     them. We are only secure in delegating power when we can dictate\r\n     its use, limit the same, or revoke it. How many of your honorable\r\n     committee would vote to make the presidency an office for life,\r\n     said office to descend to the heirs in a male line forever, with\r\n     no reserved power of impeachment? Yet you would be more fairly\r\n     represented than are American women, since they have never\r\n     elected their representatives. So far as women are concerned you\r\n     are self-constituted rulers. We cannot hope for complete\r\n     representation while we are powerless to recall, impeach, or\r\n     punish our representatives. We meet with a case in point in the\r\n     history of Virginia. Bancroft gives us the following quotation\r\n     from the official records:\r\n\r\n          The freedom of elections was further impaired by \"frequent\r\n          false returns,\" made by the sheriffs. Against these the\r\n          people had no sufficient redress, for the sheriffs were\r\n          responsible neither to them nor to officers of their\r\n          appointment. And how could a more pregnant cause of\r\n          discontent exist in a country where the elective franchise\r\n          was cherished as the dearest civil privilege?--If land is to\r\n          be taxed, none but landholders should elect the\r\n          legislature.--The other freemen, who are the more in number,\r\n          may refuse to be bound by those laws in which they have no\r\n          representation, and we are so well acquainted with the\r\n          temper of the people that we have reason to believe they had\r\n          rather pay their taxes than lose that privilege.\r\n\r\n     Would those statesmen have dared to tax those landholders and yet\r\n     deny them the privilege of choosing their representatives? And\r\n     if, forsooth, they had, would not each one of you have declared\r\n     such act unconstitutional and unjust? We are the daughters of\r\n     those liberty-loving patriots. Their blood flows in our veins,\r\n     and in view of the recognized physiological fact that special\r\n     characteristics are transmitted from fathers to daughters, do you\r\n     wonder that we tax-paying, American-born citizens of these United\r\n     States are here to protest in the name of liberty and justice? We\r\n     recognize, however, that you are not responsible for the present\r\n     political condition of women, and that the question confronting\r\n     you, as statesmen called to administer justice under existing\r\n     conditions, is, \"What are the capacities of this great class for\r\n     self-government?\" You have cautiously summoned us to adduce proof\r\n     that the ballot in the hands of women would prove a help, not a\r\n     hindrance; would bring wings, not weights.\r\n\r\n     First, then, we ask you in the significant name of history to\r\n     read the record of woman as a ruler from the time when Deborah\r\n     judged Israel, and the land had rest and peace forty years, even\r\n     down to this present when Victoria Regina, the Empress Queen,\r\n     rules her vast kingdom so ably that we sometimes hear American\r\n     men talk about a return \"to the good old ways of limited\r\n     monarchy,\" with woman for a ruler. John Stuart Mill, after\r\n     studious research, testifies as follows:\r\n\r\n          When to queens and emperors we add regents and viceroys of\r\n          provinces, the list of women who have been eminent rulers of\r\n          mankind swells to a great length. The fact is so undeniable\r\n          that some one long ago tried to retort the argument by\r\n          saying that queens are better than kings, because under\r\n          kings women govern, but under queens, men. Especially is her\r\n          wonderful talent for governing evinced in Asia. If a Hindoo\r\n          principality is strongly, vigilantly, and economically\r\n          governed; if order is preserved without oppression; if\r\n          cultivation is extending, and the people prosperous, in\r\n          three cases out of four that principality is under a woman's\r\n          rule. This fact, to me an entirely unexpected one, I have\r\n          collected from a long official knowledge of Hindoo\r\n          governments. There are many such instances; for though by\r\n          Hindoo institutions a woman cannot reign, she is the legal\r\n          regent of a kingdom during the minority of the heir--and\r\n          minorities are frequent, the lives of the male rulers being\r\n          so often prematurely terminated through their inactivity and\r\n          excesses. When we consider that these princesses have never\r\n          been seen in public, have never conversed with any man not\r\n          of their own family, except from behind a curtain; that they\r\n          do not read, and if they did, there is no book in their\r\n          languages which can give them the smallest instruction on\r\n          political affairs, the example they afford of the natural\r\n          capacity of women for government is very striking.\r\n\r\n     In view of these facts, does it not appear that if there is any\r\n     one distinctively feminine characteristic, it is the\r\n     mother-instinct for government? But now with clearer vision we\r\n     reread the record of the past. True, we find no Raphael or\r\n     Beethoven, no Phidias or Michael Angelo among women. No woman has\r\n     painted the greatest picture, carved the finest statue, composed\r\n     the noblest oratorio or opera. Not many women's names appear\r\n     after Joan of Arc's in the long list of warriors; but, as a\r\n     ruler, woman stands to-day the peer of man.\r\n\r\n     While man has rendered such royal service in the realm of art,\r\n     woman has not been idle. Infinite wisdom has intrusted to her the\r\n     living, breathing marble or canvas, and with smiles and tears,\r\n     prayers and songs has she patiently wrought developing the latent\r\n     possibilities of the divine Christ-child, the infant Washington,\r\n     the baby Lincoln. Ah! since God and men have intrusted to woman\r\n     the weightiest responsibility known to earth, the development and\r\n     education of the human soul, need you fear to intrust her with\r\n     citizenship? Is the ballot more precious than the soul of your\r\n     child? If it is safe in the home, in the school-room, the\r\n     Sunday-school, to place in woman's hands the education of your\r\n     children, is it not safe to allow that mother to express her\r\n     choice in regard to which one of these sons, her boys whom she\r\n     has taught and nursed, shall make laws for her guidance?\r\n\r\n     Just here, in imagination, is heard the question, \"How much help\r\n     could we expect from women on financial questions?\" We accept the\r\n     masculine idea of woman's mathematical deficiencies. We have had\r\n     slight opportunity for discovering the best proportions of a\r\n     silver dollar, owing to the fact that the family specimens have\r\n     been zealously guarded by the male members; and yet, we may have\r\n     some latent possibilities in that direction, since already the\r\n     \"brethren\" in our debt-burdened churches wail out from the depths\r\n     of masculine indebtedness and interest-tables, \"Our sisters, we\r\n     pray you come over and help us!\" And, in view of the fact of the\r\n     present condition of finances, in view of the fact of the\r\n     enormous taxes you impose upon us, can you look us calmly in the\r\n     face and assert that matters might, would, should, or could have\r\n     been worse, even though Julia Ward Howe, Mary A. Livermore, or\r\n     Elizabeth Cady Stanton, had voted on the silver bill?\r\n\r\n     A moment since I referred to the great responsibilities of\r\n     motherhood, and doubtless your mental comment was, \"Yes, that is\r\n     woman's peculiar sphere; there she should be content to remain.\"\r\n     It _is_ our sphere--beautiful, glorious, almost infinite in its\r\n     possibilities. We accept the work; we only ask for opportunity to\r\n     perform it. The sphere has enlarged, that is all. There has been\r\n     a new revelation. That historic \"first gun\" proclaimed a\r\n     wonderful message to the daughters of America; for, when the\r\n     smoke of the cannonading had lifted, the entire horizon of woman\r\n     was broadened, illuminated, glorified. On that April morn, when a\r\n     nation of citizens suddenly sprang into an army of warriors, with\r\n     a patriotism as intense, a consecration as true, American women\r\n     quietly assumed their vacated places and became citizens. New\r\n     boundaries were defined. A Mary Somerville or Maria Mitchell\r\n     seized the telescope and alone with God and the stars, cast a new\r\n     horoscope for woman. And the new truth, electrifying, glorifying\r\n     American womanhood to-day, is the discovery that the State is\r\n     but the larger family, the nation the old homestead, and that in\r\n     this national home there is a room and a corner and a duty for\r\n     \"mother.\" A duty recognized by such a statesman as John Adams,\r\n     who wrote to his wife in regard to her mother:\r\n\r\n          Your mother had a clear and penetrating understanding and a\r\n          profound judgment, as well as an honest, a friendly and\r\n          charitable heart. There is one thing, however, which you\r\n          will forgive me if I hint to you. Let me ask you rather if\r\n          you are not of my opinion. Were not her talents and virtues\r\n          too much confined to private, social and domestic life? My\r\n          opinion of the duties of religion and morality comprehends a\r\n          very extensive connection with society at large and the\r\n          great interests of the public. Does not natural morality\r\n          and, much more, Christian benevolence make it our\r\n          indispensable duty to endeavor to serve our fellow-creatures\r\n          to the utmost of our power in promoting and supporting those\r\n          great political systems and general regulations upon which\r\n          the happiness of multitudes depends? The benevolence,\r\n          charity, capacity and industry which exerted in private life\r\n          would make a family, a parish or a town happy, employed upon\r\n          a larger scale and in support of the great principles of\r\n          virtue and freedom of political regulations, might secure\r\n          whole nations and generations from misery, want and\r\n          contempt.\r\n\r\n     Intense domestic life is selfish. The home evidently needs\r\n     fathers as much as mothers. Tender, wise fatherhood is beautiful\r\n     as motherhood, but there are orphaned children to be cared for.\r\n     These duties to the State and nation as mothers, true to the\r\n     highest needs of our children, we dare not ignore; and the nation\r\n     cannot much longer afford to have us ignore them.\r\n\r\n     As statesmen, walking on the shore piled high with the\r\n     \"drift-wood of kings,\" the wrecks of nations and governments, you\r\n     have discovered the one word emblazoned as an epitaph on each and\r\n     every one, \"Luxury, luxury, luxury!\" You have hitherto placed a\r\n     premium upon woman's idleness, helplessness, dependence. The\r\n     children of most of our fashionable women are being educated by\r\n     foreign nurses. How can you expect them to develop into patriotic\r\n     American statesmen? For the sake of country I plead--for the sake\r\n     of a responsible, exalted womanhood; for the sake of a purer\r\n     womanhood; for home and truth, and native land. As a daughter,\r\n     with holiest, tenderest, most grateful memories clinging to the\r\n     almost sacred name of father; as a wife, receiving constant\r\n     encouragement, support, and cooeperation from one who has revealed\r\n     to her the genuine nobility of true manhood; as a mother, whose\r\n     heart still thrills at the first greeting from her little son;\r\n     and as a sister, watching with intense interest the entrance of a\r\n     brother into the great world of work, I could not be half so\r\n     loyal to woman's cause were it not a synonym for the equal rights\r\n     of humanity--a diviner justice for all!\r\n\r\n     With one practical question I rest my case. The world objected to\r\n     woman's entrance into literature, the pulpit, the lyceum, the\r\n     college, the school. What has she wrought? Our wisest thinkers\r\n     and historians assert that literature has been purified. Poets\r\n     and judges at international collegiate contests award to woman's\r\n     thought the highest prize. Miss Lucia Peabody received upon the\r\n     occasion of her second election to the Boston school board the\r\n     highest vote ever polled for any candidate. Since woman has\r\n     proved faithful over a few things, need you fear to summon her to\r\n     your side to assist you in executing the will of the nation? And\r\n     now, yielding to none in intense love of womanhood; standing here\r\n     beneath the very dome of the national capitol overshadowed by the\r\n     old flag; with the blood of the revolutionary patriots coursing\r\n     through my veins; as a native-born, tax-paying American citizen,\r\n     I ask equality before the law.\r\n\r\n     ELIZABETH CADY STANTON said: _Gentlemen of the Committee_: In\r\n     appearing before you to ask for a sixteenth amendment to the\r\n     United States Constitution, permit me to say that with the Hon.\r\n     Charles Sumner, we believe that our constitution, fairly\r\n     interpreted, already secures to the humblest individual all the\r\n     rights, privileges and immunities of American citizens. But as\r\n     statesmen differ in their interpretations of constitutional law\r\n     as widely as they differ in their organizations, the rights of\r\n     every class of citizens must be clearly defined in concise,\r\n     unmistakable language. All the great principles of liberty\r\n     declared by the fathers gave no protection to the black man of\r\n     the republic for a century, and when, with higher light and\r\n     knowledge his emancipation and enfranchisement were proclaimed,\r\n     it was said that the great truths set forth in the prolonged\r\n     debates of thirty years on the individual rights of the black\r\n     man, culminating in the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to\r\n     the constitution, had no significance for woman. Hence we ask\r\n     that this anomalous class of beings, not recognized by the\r\n     supreme powers as either \"persons\" or \"citizens\" may be defined\r\n     and their rights declared in the constitution.\r\n\r\n     In the adjustment of the question of suffrage now before the\r\n     people of this country for settlement, it is of the highest\r\n     importance that the organic law of the land should be so framed\r\n     and construed as to work injustice to none, but secure as far as\r\n     possible perfect political equality among all classes of\r\n     citizens. In determining your right and power to legislate on\r\n     this question, consider what has been done already.\r\n\r\n     As the national constitution declares that \"all persons born or\r\n     naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction\r\n     thereof, are citizens of the United States, and of the State\r\n     wherein they reside,\" it is evident: _First_--That the immunities\r\n     and privileges of American citizenship, however defined, are\r\n     national in character, and paramount to all State authority.\r\n     _Second_--That while the constitution leaves the qualification of\r\n     electors to the several States, it nowhere gives them the right\r\n     to deprive any citizen of the elective franchise; the State may\r\n     regulate but not abolish the right of suffrage for any class.\r\n     _Third_--As the Constitution of the United States expressly\r\n     declares that no State shall make or enforce any law that shall\r\n     abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United\r\n     States, those provisions of the several State constitutions that\r\n     exclude citizens from the franchise on account of sex, alike\r\n     violate the spirit and letter of the Federal constitution.\r\n     _Fourth_--As the question of naturalization is expressly withheld\r\n     from the States, and as the States would clearly have no right to\r\n     deprive of the franchise naturalized citizens, among whom women\r\n     are expressly included, still more clearly have they no right to\r\n     deprive native-born women-citizens of the right.\r\n\r\n     Let me give you a few extracts from the national constitution\r\n     upon which these propositions are based:\r\n\r\n          _Preamble:_ We, the people of the United States, in order to\r\n          form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure\r\n          domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense,\r\n          promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of\r\n          liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and\r\n          establish this constitution.\r\n\r\n     This is declared to be a government \"of the people.\" All power,\r\n     it is said, centers in the people. Our State constitutions also\r\n     open with the words, \"We, the people.\" Does any one pretend to\r\n     say that men alone constitute races and peoples? When we say\r\n     parents, do we not mean mothers as well as fathers? When we say\r\n     children, do we not mean girls as well as boys? When we say\r\n     people, do we not mean women as well as men? When the race shall\r\n     spring, Minerva-like, from the brains of their fathers, it will\r\n     be time enough thus to ignore the fact that one-half the human\r\n     family are women. Individual rights, individual conscience and\r\n     judgment are our great American ideas, the fundamental principles\r\n     of our political and religious faith. Men may as well attempt to\r\n     do our repenting, confessing, and believing, as our voting--as\r\n     well represent us at the throne of grace as at the ballot-box.\r\n\r\n          ARTICLE 1, SEC. 9.--No bill of attainder, or _ex post facto_\r\n          law shall be passed; no title of nobility shall be granted\r\n          by the United States.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 10.--No State shall pass any bill of attainder, _ex\r\n          post facto_ law, or law impairing the obligation of\r\n          contracts, or grant any title of nobility.\r\n\r\n     Notwithstanding these provisions of the constitution, bills of\r\n     attainder have been passed by the introduction of the word \"male\"\r\n     into all the State constitutions denying to woman the right of\r\n     suffrage, and thereby making sex a crime. A citizen disfranchised\r\n     in a republic is a citizen attainted. When we place in the hands\r\n     of one class of citizens the right to make, interpret and execute\r\n     the law for another class wholly unrepresented in the government,\r\n     we have made an order of nobility.\r\n\r\n          ARTICLE 4, SEC. 2.--The citizens of each State shall be\r\n          entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in\r\n          the several States.\r\n\r\n     The elective franchise is one of the privileges secured by this\r\n     section approved in Dunham _vs._ Lamphere (3 Gray Mass. Rep.,\r\n     276), and Bennett _vs._ Boggs (Baldwin's Rep., p. 72, Circuit\r\n     Court U. S.).\r\n\r\n          ARTICLE 4, SEC. 4.--The United States shall guarantee to\r\n          every State in the Union a republican form of government.\r\n\r\n     How can that form of government be called republican in which\r\n     one-half the people are forever deprived of all participation in\r\n     its affairs?\r\n\r\n          ARTICLE 6.--This Constitution, and the laws of the United\r\n          States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, ... shall\r\n          be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every\r\n          State shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution\r\n          or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n          ARTICLE 14, SEC. 1.--All persons born or naturalized in the\r\n          United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are\r\n          citizens of the United States.... No State shall make or\r\n          enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges and\r\n          immunities of citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\n     In the discussion of the enfranchisement of woman, suffrage is\r\n     now claimed by one class of thinkers as a privilege based upon\r\n     citizenship and secured by the Constitution of the United States,\r\n     as by lexicographers as well as by the constitution itself, the\r\n     definition of citizen includes women as well as men. No State can\r\n     rightfully deprive a woman-citizen of the United States of any\r\n     fundamental right which is hers in common with all other\r\n     citizens. The States have the right to regulate, but not to\r\n     prohibit the elective franchise to citizens of the United States.\r\n     Thus the States may determine the qualifications of electors.\r\n     They may require the elector to be of a certain age--to have had\r\n     a fixed residence--to be of sane mind and unconvicted of\r\n     crime,--because these are qualifications or conditions that all\r\n     citizens, sooner or later, may attain. But to go beyond this, and\r\n     say to one-half the citizens of the State, notwithstanding you\r\n     possess all of these qualifications, you shall never vote, is of\r\n     the very essence of despotism. It is a bill of attainder of the\r\n     most odious character.\r\n\r\n     A further investigation of the subject will show that the\r\n     constitutions of all the States, with the exception of Virginia\r\n     and Massachusetts, read substantially alike. \"White male\r\n     citizens\" shall be entitled to vote, and this is supposed to\r\n     exclude all other citizens. There is no direct exclusion except\r\n     in the two States above named. Now the error lies in supposing\r\n     that an enabling clause is necessary at all. The right of the\r\n     people of a State to participate in a government of their own\r\n     creation requires no enabling clause, neither can it be taken\r\n     from them by implication. To hold otherwise would be to\r\n     interpolate in the constitution a prohibition that does not\r\n     exist.\r\n\r\n     In framing a constitution, the people are assembled in their\r\n     sovereign capacity, and being possessed of all rights and powers,\r\n     what is not surrendered is retained. Nothing short of a direct\r\n     prohibition can work a deprivation of rights that are\r\n     fundamental. In the language of John Jay to the people of New\r\n     York, urging the adoption of the constitution of the United\r\n     States: \"Silence and blank paper neither give nor take away\r\n     anything.\" And Alexander Hamilton says (_Federalist_, No. 83):\r\n\r\n          Every man of discernment must at once perceive the wide\r\n          difference between silence and abolition. The mode and\r\n          manner in which the people shall take part in the government\r\n          of their creation may be prescribed by the constitution, but\r\n          the right itself is antecedent to all constitutions. It is\r\n          inalienable, and can neither be bought nor sold nor given\r\n          away.\r\n\r\n     But even if it should be held that this view is untenable, and\r\n     that women are disfranchised by the several State constitutions,\r\n     directly or by implication, then I say that such prohibitions are\r\n     clearly in conflict with the Constitution of the United States\r\n     and yield thereto.\r\n\r\n     Another class of thinkers, equally interested in woman's\r\n     enfranchisement, maintain that there is, as yet, no power in the\r\n     United States Constitution to protect the rights of all United\r\n     States citizens, in all latitudes and longitudes, and in all\r\n     conditions whatever. When the constitution was adopted, the\r\n     fathers thought they had secured national unity. This was the\r\n     opinion of Southern as well as Northern statesmen. It was\r\n     supposed that the question of State rights was then forever\r\n     settled. Hon. Charles Sumner, speaking on this point in the\r\n     United States Senate, March 7, 1866, said the object of the\r\n     constitution was to ordain, under the authority of the people, a\r\n     national government possessing unity and power. The\r\n     confederation had been merely an agreement \"between the States,\"\r\n     styled, \"a league of firm friendship.\" Found to be feeble and\r\n     inoperative through the pretension of State rights, it gave way\r\n     to the constitution which, instead of a \"league,\" created a\r\n     \"union,\" in the name of the people of the United States.\r\n     Beginning with these inspiring and enacting words, \"We, the\r\n     people,\" it was popular and national. Here was no concession to\r\n     State rights, but a recognition of the power of the people, from\r\n     whom the constitution proceeded. The States are acknowledged; but\r\n     they are all treated as component parts of the Union in which\r\n     they are absorbed under the constitution, which is the supreme\r\n     law. There is but one sovereignty, and that is the sovereignty of\r\n     the United States. On this very account the adoption of the\r\n     constitution was opposed by Patrick Henry and George Mason. The\r\n     first exclaimed, \"That this is a consolidated government is\r\n     demonstrably clear; the question turns on that poor little thing,\r\n     'We, the people,' instead of the States.\" The second exclaimed,\r\n     \"Whether the constitution is good or bad, it is a national\r\n     government, and no longer a confederation.\" But against this\r\n     powerful opposition the constitution was adopted in the name of\r\n     the people of the United States. Throughout the discussions,\r\n     State rights was treated with little favor. Madison said: \"The\r\n     States are only political societies, and never possessed the\r\n     right of sovereignty.\" Gerry said: \"The States have only\r\n     corporate rights.\" Wilson, the philanthropic member from\r\n     Pennsylvania, afterward a learned Judge of the Supreme Court of\r\n     the United States and author of the \"Lectures on Law,\" said:\r\n     \"Will a regard to State rights justify the sacrifice of the\r\n     rights of men? If we proceed on any other foundation than the\r\n     last, our building will neither be solid nor lasting.\"\r\n\r\n     Those of us who understand the dignity, power and protection of\r\n     the ballot, have steadily petitioned congress for the last ten\r\n     years to secure to the women of the republic the exercise of\r\n     their right to the elective franchise. We began by asking a\r\n     sixteenth amendment to the national constitution. March 15, 1869,\r\n     the Hon. George W. Julian submitted a joint resolution to\r\n     congress, to enfranchise the women of the republic, by proposing\r\n     a sixteenth amendment:\r\n\r\n          ARTICLE 16.--The right of suffrage in the United States\r\n          shall be based on citizenship, and shall be regulated by\r\n          Congress, and all citizens of the United States, whether\r\n          native or naturalized, shall enjoy this right equally,\r\n          without any distinction or discrimination whatever founded\r\n          on sex.\r\n\r\n     While the discussion was pending for the emancipation and\r\n     enfranchisement of the slaves of the South, and popular thought\r\n     led back to the consideration of the fundamental principles of\r\n     our government, it was clearly seen that all the arguments for\r\n     the civil and political rights of the African race applied to\r\n     women also. Seeing this, some Republicans stood ready to carry\r\n     these principles to their logical results. Democrats, too, saw\r\n     the drift of the argument, and though not in favor of extending\r\n     suffrage to either black men, or women, yet, to embarrass\r\n     Republican legislation, it was said, they proposed amendments for\r\n     woman suffrage to all bills brought forward for enfranchising the\r\n     negroes.\r\n\r\n     And thus, during the passage of the thirteenth, fourteenth and\r\n     fifteenth amendments, and the District suffrage bill, the\r\n     question of woman suffrage was often and ably discussed in the\r\n     Senate and House, and received both Republican and Democratic\r\n     votes in its favor. Many able lawyers and judges gave it as their\r\n     opinion that women as well as Africans were enfranchised by the\r\n     fourteenth and fifteenth Amendments. Accordingly, we abandoned,\r\n     for the time being, our demand for a sixteenth amendment, and\r\n     pleaded our right of suffrage, as already secured by the\r\n     fourteenth amendment--the argument lying in a nut-shell. For if,\r\n     as therein asserted, all persons born or naturalized in the\r\n     United States are citizens of the United States; and if a\r\n     citizen, according to the best authorities, is one possessed of\r\n     all the rights and privileges of citizenship, namely, the right\r\n     to make laws and choose lawmakers, women, being persons, must be\r\n     citizens, and therefore entitled to the rights of citizenship,\r\n     the chief of which is the right to vote.\r\n\r\n     Accordingly, women tested their right, registered and voted--the\r\n     inspectors of election accepting the argument, for which\r\n     inspectors and women alike were arrested, tried and punished; the\r\n     courts deciding that although by the fourteenth amendment they\r\n     were citizens, still, citizenship did not carry with it the right\r\n     to vote. But granting the premise of the Supreme Court decision,\r\n     \"that the constitution does not confer suffrage on any one,\" then\r\n     it inhered with the citizen before the constitution was framed.\r\n     Our national life does not date from that instrument. The\r\n     constitution is not the original declaration of rights. It was\r\n     not framed until eleven years after our existence as a nation,\r\n     nor fully ratified until nearly fourteen years after the\r\n     inauguration of our national independence.\r\n\r\n     But however the letter and spirit of the constitution may be\r\n     interpreted by the people, the judiciary of the nation has\r\n     uniformly proved itself the echo of the party in power. When the\r\n     slave power was dominant the Supreme Court decided that a black\r\n     man was not a citizen, because he had not the right to vote; and\r\n     when the constitution was so amended as to make all persons\r\n     citizens, the same high tribunal decided that a woman, though a\r\n     citizen, had not the right to vote. An African, by virtue of his\r\n     United States citizenship, is declared, under recent amendments,\r\n     a voter in every State of the Union; but when a woman, by virtue\r\n     of her United States citizenship, applies to the Supreme Court\r\n     for protection in the exercise of this same right, she is\r\n     remanded to the State, by the unanimous decision of the nine\r\n     judges on the bench, that \"the Constitution of the United States\r\n     does not confer the right of suffrage upon any one.\" Such\r\n     vacillating interpretations of constitutional law must unsettle\r\n     our faith in judicial authority, and undermine the liberties of\r\n     the whole people. Seeing by these decisions of the courts that\r\n     the theory of our government, the Declaration of Independence,\r\n     and recent constitutional amendments, have no significance for\r\n     woman, that all the grand principles of equality are glittering\r\n     generalities for her, we must fall back once more to our former\r\n     demand of a sixteenth amendment to the federal constitution,\r\n     that, in clear, unmistakable language, shall declare the status\r\n     of woman in this republic.\r\n\r\n     The Declaration of Independence struck a blow at every existent\r\n     form of government by making the individual the source of all\r\n     power. This is the sun, and the one central truth around which\r\n     all genuine republics must keep their course or perish. National\r\n     supremacy means something more than power to levy war, conclude\r\n     peace, contract alliances, establish commerce. It means national\r\n     protection and security in the exercise of the right of\r\n     self-government, which comes alone by and through the use of the\r\n     ballot. Women are the only class of citizens still wholly\r\n     unrepresented in the government, and yet we possess every\r\n     requisite qualification for voters in the United States. Women\r\n     possess property and education; we take out naturalization-papers\r\n     and passports and register ships. We preempt lands, pay taxes\r\n     (women sometimes work out the road-tax with their own hands) and\r\n     suffer for our own violation of laws. We are neither idiots,\r\n     lunatics, nor criminals, and according to our State constitution\r\n     lack but one qualification for voters, namely, sex, which is an\r\n     insurmountable qualification, and therefore equivalent to a bill\r\n     of attainder against one-half the people, a power neither the\r\n     States nor the United States can legally exercise, being\r\n     forbidden in article 1, sections 9, 10, of the constitution. Our\r\n     rulers have the right to regulate the suffrage, but they cannot\r\n     abolish it for any class of citizens, as has been done in the\r\n     case of the women of this republic, without a direct violation of\r\n     the fundamental law of the land. All concessions of privileges or\r\n     redress of grievances are mockery for any class that have no\r\n     voice in the laws, and law-makers; hence we demand the ballot,\r\n     that scepter of power in our own hands, as the only sure\r\n     protection for our rights of person and property under all\r\n     conditions. If the few may grant and withhold rights at their\r\n     pleasure, the many cannot be said to enjoy the blessings of\r\n     self-government.\r\n\r\n     William H. Seward said in his great speech on \"Freedom and\r\n     Union,\" in the United States Senate, February 29, 1860:\r\n\r\n          Mankind have a natural right, a natural instinct, and a\r\n          natural capacity for self-government; and when, as here,\r\n          they are sufficiently ripened by culture, they will and must\r\n          have self-government, and no other.\r\n\r\n     Jefferson said:\r\n\r\n          The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time;\r\n          the hand of freedom may destroy, but cannot disjoin them.\r\n\r\n     Few people comprehend the length and breadth of the principle we\r\n     are advocating to-day, and how closely it is allied to everything\r\n     vital in our system of government. Our personal grievances, such\r\n     as being robbed of property and children by unjust husbands;\r\n     denied admission into the colleges, the trades and professions;\r\n     compelled to work at starving prices, by no means round out this\r\n     whole question. In asking for a sixteenth amendment to the United\r\n     States Constitution, and the protection of congress against the\r\n     injustice of State law, we are fighting the same battle as\r\n     Jefferson and Hamilton fought in 1776, as Calhoun and Clay in\r\n     1828, as Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis in 1860, namely, the\r\n     limit of State rights and federal power. The enfranchisement of\r\n     woman involves the same vital principle of our government that is\r\n     dividing and distracting the two great political parties at this\r\n     hour.\r\n\r\n     There is nothing a foreigner coming here finds it so difficult to\r\n     understand as the wheel within a wheel in our national and State\r\n     governments, and the possibility of carrying them on without\r\n     friction; and this is the difficulty and danger we are fast\r\n     finding out. The recent amendments are steps in the right\r\n     direction toward national unity, securing equal rights to all\r\n     citizens, in every latitude and longitude. But our congressional\r\n     debates, judicial decisions, and the utterances of campaign\r\n     orators, continually falling back to the old ground, are bundles\r\n     of contradictions on this vital question. Inasmuch as we are,\r\n     first, citizens of the United States, and second, of the State\r\n     wherein we reside, the primal rights of all citizens should be\r\n     regulated by the national government, and complete equality in\r\n     civil and political rights everywhere secured. When women are\r\n     denied the right to enter institutions of learning, and practice\r\n     in the professions, unjust discriminations made against sex even\r\n     more degrading and humiliating than were ever made against color,\r\n     surely woman, too, should be protected by a civil-rights bill and\r\n     a sixteenth amendment that should make her political status equal\r\n     with all other citizens of the republic.\r\n\r\n     The right of suffrage, like the currency of the post-office\r\n     department, demands national regulation. We can all remember the\r\n     losses sustained by citizens in traveling from one State to\r\n     another under the old system of State banks. We can imagine the\r\n     confusion if each State regulated its post-offices, and the\r\n     transit of the mails across its borders. The benefits we find in\r\n     uniformity and unity in these great interests would pervade all\r\n     others where equal conditions were secured. Some citizens are\r\n     asking for a national bankrupt law, that a person released from\r\n     his debts in one State may be free in every other. Some are for a\r\n     religious freedom amendment that shall forever separate church\r\n     and State; forbidding a religious test as a condition of suffrage\r\n     or a qualification for office; forbidding the reading of the\r\n     Bible in the schools and the exempting of church property and\r\n     sectarian institutions of learning or charity from taxation. Some\r\n     are demanding a national marriage law, that a man legally married\r\n     in one State may not be a bigamist in another. Some are asking a\r\n     national prohibitory law, that a reformed drunkard who is\r\n     shielded from temptation in one State may not be environed with\r\n     dangers in another. And thus many individual interests point to a\r\n     growing feeling among the people in favor of homogeneous\r\n     legislation. As several of the States are beginning to legislate\r\n     on the woman suffrage question, it is of vital moment that there\r\n     should be some national action.\r\n\r\n     As the laws now are, a woman who can vote, hold office, be tried\r\n     by a jury of her own peers--yea, and sit on the bench as justice\r\n     of the peace in the territory of Wyoming, may be reduced to a\r\n     political pariah in the State of New York. A woman who can vote\r\n     and hold office on the school board, and act as county\r\n     superintendent in Kansas and Minnesota, is denied these rights in\r\n     passing into Pennsylvania. A woman who can be a member of the\r\n     school board in Maine, Wisconsin, Iowa, and California, loses all\r\n     these privileges in New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware. When\r\n     representatives from the territories are sent to congress by the\r\n     votes of women, it is time to have some national recognition of\r\n     this class of citizens.\r\n\r\n     This demand of national protection for national citizens is fated\r\n     to grow stronger every day. The government of the United States,\r\n     as the constitution is now interpreted, is powerless to give a\r\n     just equivalent for the supreme allegiance it claims. One sound\r\n     democratic principle fully recognized and carried to its logical\r\n     results in our government, declaring all citizens equal before\r\n     the law, would soon chase away the metaphysical mists and fogs\r\n     that cloud our political views in so many directions. When\r\n     congress is asked to put the name of God in the constitution, and\r\n     thereby pledge the nation to some theological faith in which some\r\n     United States citizens may not believe and thus subject a certain\r\n     class to political ostracism and social persecution, it is asked\r\n     not to protect but to oppress the citizens of the several States\r\n     in their most sacred rights--to think, reason, and decide all\r\n     questions of religion and conscience for themselves, without fear\r\n     or favor from the government. Popular sentiment and church\r\n     persecution is all that an advanced thinker in science and\r\n     religion should be called on to combat. The State should rather\r\n     throw its shield of protection around those uttering liberal,\r\n     progressive ideas; for the nation has the same interest in every\r\n     new thought as it has in the invention of new machinery to\r\n     lighten labor, in the discovery of wells of oil, or mines of\r\n     coal, copper, iron, silver or gold. As in the laboratory of\r\n     nature new forms of beauty are forever revealing themselves, so\r\n     in the world of thought a higher outlook gives a clearer vision\r\n     of the heights man in freedom shall yet attain. The day is past\r\n     for persecuting the philosophers of the physical sciences. But\r\n     what a holocaust of martyrs bigotry is still making of those\r\n     bearing the richest treasures of thought, in religion and social\r\n     ethics, in their efforts to roll off the mountains of\r\n     superstition that have so long darkened the human mind!\r\n\r\n     The numerous demands by the people for national protection in\r\n     many rights not specified in the constitution, prove that the\r\n     people have outgrown the compact that satisfied the fathers, and\r\n     the more it is expounded and understood the more clearly its\r\n     monarchical features can be traced to its English origin. And it\r\n     is not at all surprising that, with no chart or compass for a\r\n     republic, our fathers, with all their educational prejudices in\r\n     favor of the mother country, with her literature and systems of\r\n     jurisprudence, should have also adopted her ideas of government,\r\n     and in drawing up their national compact engrafted the new\r\n     republic on the old constitutional monarchy, a union whose\r\n     incompatibility has involved their sons in continued discussion\r\n     as to the true meaning of the instrument. A recent writer says:\r\n\r\n          The Constitution of the United States is the result of a\r\n          fourfold compromise: _First_--Of unity with individual\r\n          interests; of national sovereignty with the so-called\r\n          sovereignty of States; _Second_--Of the republic with\r\n          monarchy; _Third_--Of freedom with slavery; _Fourth_--Of\r\n          democracy with aristocracy.\r\n\r\n     It is founded, therefore, on the fourfold combination of\r\n     principles perfectly incompatible and eternally excluding each\r\n     other; founded for the purpose of equally preserving these\r\n     principles in spite of their incompatibility, and of carrying\r\n     out their practical results--in other words, for the purpose of\r\n     making an impossible thing possible. And a century of discussion\r\n     has not yet made the constitution understood. It has no settled\r\n     interpretation. Being a series of compromises, it can be\r\n     expounded in favor of many directly opposite principles.\r\n\r\n     A distinguished American statesman remarked that the war of the\r\n     rebellion was waged \"to expound the constitution.\" It is a\r\n     pertinent question now, shall all other contradictory principles\r\n     be retained in the constitution until they, too, are expounded by\r\n     civil war? On what theory is it less dangerous to defraud twenty\r\n     million women of their inalienable rights than four million\r\n     negroes? Is not the same principle involved in both cases? We ask\r\n     congress to pass a sixteenth amendment, not only for woman's\r\n     protection, but for the safety of the nation. Our people are\r\n     filled with unrest to-day because there is no fair understanding\r\n     of the basis of individual rights, nor the legitimate power of\r\n     the national government. The Republican party took the ground\r\n     during the war that congress had the right to establish a\r\n     national currency in every State; that it had the right to\r\n     emancipate and enfranchise the slaves; to change their political\r\n     status in one-half the States of the union; to pass a civil\r\n     rights bill, securing to the freedman a place in the schools,\r\n     colleges, trades, professions, hotels, and all public conveyances\r\n     for travel. And they maintained their right to do all these as\r\n     the best measures for peace, though compelled by war.\r\n\r\n     And now, when congress is asked to extend the same protection to\r\n     the women of the nation, we are told they have not the power, and\r\n     we are remanded to the States. They say the emancipation of the\r\n     slave was a war measure, a military necessity; that his\r\n     enfranchisement was a political necessity. We might with\r\n     propriety ask if the present condition of the nation, with its\r\n     political outlook, its election frauds daily reported, the\r\n     corrupt action of men in official position, governors, judges,\r\n     and boards of canvassers, has not brought us to a moral necessity\r\n     where some new element is needed in government. But, alas! when\r\n     women appeal to congress for the protection of their natural\r\n     rights of person and property, they send us for redress to the\r\n     courts, and the courts remand us to the States. You did not trust\r\n     the Southern freedman to the arbitrary will of courts and States!\r\n     Why send your mothers, wives and daughters to the unwashed,\r\n     unlettered, unthinking masses that carry popular elections?\r\n\r\n     We are told by one class of philosophers that the growing\r\n     tendency to increase national power and authority is leading to a\r\n     dangerous centralization; that the safety of the republic rests\r\n     in local self-government. Says the editor of the Boston _Index_:\r\n\r\n          What is local self-government? Briefly, that without any\r\n          interference from without, every citizen should manage his\r\n          own personal affairs in his own way, according to his own\r\n          pleasure; that every town should manage its own town affairs\r\n          in the same manner and under the same restriction; every\r\n          county its own county affairs, every State its own State\r\n          affairs. But the independent exercise of this autonomy, by\r\n          personal and corporate individuals, has one fundamental\r\n          condition, viz.: the maintenance of all these\r\n          individualities intact, each in its own sphere of action,\r\n          with its rights uninfringed and its freedom uncurtailed in\r\n          that sphere, yet each also preserving its just relation to\r\n          all the rest in an all comprehensive social organization.\r\n          Every citizen would thus stand, as it were, in the center of\r\n          several concentric and enlarging circles of relationship to\r\n          his kind; he would have duties and rights in each relation,\r\n          not only as an individual but also as a member of town,\r\n          county, State and national organization. His local\r\n          self-government will be at his highest possible point of\r\n          realization, when in each of these relations his individual\r\n          duties are discharged and his rights maintained.\r\n\r\n     On the other hand, what is centralization?\r\n\r\n          It is such a disorganization of this well-balanced,\r\n          harmonious and natural system as shall result in the\r\n          absorption of all substantial power by a central authority,\r\n          to the destruction of the autonomy of the various\r\n          individualities above mentioned; such as was produced, for\r\n          instance, when the _municipia_ of the Roman empire lost\r\n          their corporate independence and melted into the vast\r\n          imperial despotism which prepared the way for the collapse\r\n          of society under the blows of Northern barbarism. Such a\r\n          centralization must inevitably be produced by decay of that\r\n          stubborn stickling for rights, out of which local\r\n          self-government has always grown. That is, if individual\r\n          rights in the citizen, the town, the county, the State,\r\n          shall not be vindicated as beyond all price, and defended\r\n          with the utmost jealousy, at whatever cost, the spirit of\r\n          liberty must have already died out, and the dreary process\r\n          of centralization be already far advanced. It will thus be\r\n          evident that the preservation of individual rights is the\r\n          only possible preventative of centralization, and that free\r\n          society has no interest to be compared for an instant in\r\n          importance with that of preserving these individual rights.\r\n          No nation is free in which this is not the paramount\r\n          concern. Woe to America when her sons and her daughters\r\n          begin to sneer at rights! Just so long as the citizens are\r\n          protected individually in their rights, the towns and\r\n          counties and States cannot be stripped; but if the former\r\n          lose all love for their own liberties as equal units of\r\n          society, the latter will become the empty shells of\r\n          creatures long perished. The nation as such, therefore, if\r\n          it would be itself free and non-centralized, must find its\r\n          own supreme interest in the protection of its individual\r\n          citizens in the fullest possible enjoyment of their equal\r\n          rights and liberties.\r\n\r\n     As this question of woman's enfranchisement is one of national\r\n     safety, we ask you to remember that we are citizens of the United\r\n     States, and, as such, claim the protection of the national flag\r\n     in the exercise of our national rights, in every latitude and\r\n     longitude, on sea, land, at home as well as abroad; against the\r\n     tyranny of States, as well as against foreign aggressions. Local\r\n     authorities may regulate the exercise of these rights; they may\r\n     settle all minor questions of property, but the inalienable\r\n     personal rights of citizenship should be declared by the\r\n     constitution, interpreted by the Supreme Court, protected by\r\n     congress and enforced by the arm of the executive. It is nonsense\r\n     to talk of State rights until the graver question of personal\r\n     liberties is first understood and adjusted. President Hayes, in\r\n     reply to an address of welcome at Charlottesville, Va., September\r\n     25, 1877, said:\r\n\r\n          Equality under the laws for all citizens is the corner-stone\r\n          of the structure of the restored harmony from which the\r\n          ancient friendship is to rise. In this pathway I am going,\r\n          the pathway where your illustrious men led--your Jefferson,\r\n          your Madison, your Monroe, your Washington.\r\n\r\n     If, in this statement, President Hayes is thoroughly sincere,\r\n     then he will not hesitate to approve emphatically the principle\r\n     of national protection for national citizens. He will see that\r\n     the protection of all the national citizens in all their rights,\r\n     civil, political, and religious--not by the muskets of United\r\n     States troops, but by the peaceable authority of United States\r\n     courts--is not a principle that applies to a single section of\r\n     the country, but to all sections alike; he will see that the\r\n     incorporation of such a principle in the constitution cannot be\r\n     regarded as a measure of force imposed upon the vanquished, since\r\n     it would be law alike to the vanquished and the victor. In short,\r\n     he will see that there is no other sufficient guarantee of that\r\n     equality of all citizens, which he well declares to be the\r\n     \"corner-stone of the structure of restored harmony.\" The Boston\r\n     _Journal_ of July 19, said:\r\n\r\n          There are cases where it seems as if the constitution should\r\n          empower the federal government to step in and protect the\r\n          citizen in the State, when the local authorities are in\r\n          league with the assassins; but, as it now reads, no such\r\n          provision exists.\r\n\r\n     That the constitution does not make such provision is not the\r\n     fault of the president; it must be attributed to the leading\r\n     Republicans who had it in their power once to change the\r\n     constitution so as to give the most ample powers to the general\r\n     government. When Attorney-General Devens was charged last May\r\n     with negligence in not prosecuting the parties accused of the\r\n     Mountain Meadow massacre, his defense was, that this horrible\r\n     crime was not against the United States, but against the\r\n     territory of Utah. Yet, it was a great company of industrious,\r\n     honest, unoffending United States citizens who were foully and\r\n     brutally murdered in cold blood. When Chief-Justice Waite gave\r\n     his charge to the jury in the Ellentown conspiracy cases, at\r\n     Charleston, S. C., June 1, 1877, he said:\r\n\r\n          That a number of citizens of the United States have been\r\n          killed, there can be no question; but that is not enough to\r\n          enable the government of the United States to interfere for\r\n          their protection. Under the constitution that duty belongs\r\n          to the State alone. But when an unlawful combination is made\r\n          to interfere with any of the rights of natural citizenship\r\n          secured to citizens of the United States by the national\r\n          constitution, then an offense is committed against the laws\r\n          of the United States, and it is not only the right but the\r\n          absolute duty of the national government to interfere and\r\n          afford the citizens that protection which every good\r\n          government is bound to give.\r\n\r\n     General Hawley, in an address before a college last spring, said:\r\n\r\n          Why, it is asked, does our government permit outrages in a\r\n          State which it would exert all its authority to redress,\r\n          even at the risk of war, if they were perpetrated under a\r\n          foreign government? Are the rights of American citizens more\r\n          sacred on the soil of Great Britain or France than on the\r\n          soil of one of our own States? Not at all. But the\r\n          government of the United States is clothed with power to act\r\n          with imperial sovereignty in the one case, while in the\r\n          other its authority is limited to the degree of utter\r\n          impotency, in certain circumstances. The State sovereignty\r\n          excludes the Federal over most matters of dealing between\r\n          man and man, and if the State laws are properly enforced\r\n          there is not likely to be any ground of complaint, but if\r\n          they are not, the federal government, if not specially\r\n          called on according to the terms of the constitution, is\r\n          helpless. Citizen A.B., grievously wronged, beaten, robbed,\r\n          lynched within a hair's breadth of death, may apply in vain\r\n          to any and all prosecuting officers of the State. The forms\r\n          of law that might give him redress are all there; the\r\n          prosecuting officers, judges, and sheriffs, that might act,\r\n          are there; but, under an oppressive and tyrannical public\r\n          sentiment, they refuse to move. In such an exigency the\r\n          government of the United States can do no more than the\r\n          government of any neighboring State; that is, unless the\r\n          State concerned calls for aid, or unless the offense rises\r\n          to the dignity of insurrection or rebellion. The reason is,\r\n          that the framers of our governmental system left to the\r\n          several States the sole guardianship of the personal and\r\n          relative private rights of the people.\r\n\r\n     Such is the imperfect development of our own nationality in this\r\n     respect that we have really no right as yet to call ourselves a\r\n     nation in the true sense of the word, nor shall we have while\r\n     this state of things continues. Thousands have begun to feel this\r\n     keenly, of which a few illustrations may suffice. A communication\r\n     to the New York _Tribune_, June 9, signed \"Merchant,\" said:\r\n\r\n          Before getting into a quarrel and perhaps war with Mexico\r\n          about the treatment of our flag and citizens, would it not\r\n          be as well, think you, for the government to try and make\r\n          the flag a protection to the citizens on our own soil?\r\n\r\n     That is what it has never been since the foundation of our\r\n     government in a large portion of our common country. The kind of\r\n     government the people of this country expect and intend to\r\n     have--State rights or no State rights, no matter how much blood\r\n     and treasure it may cost--is a government to protect the humblest\r\n     citizen in the exercise of all his rights.\r\n\r\n     When the rebellion of the South against the government began, one\r\n     of the most noted secessionists of Baltimore asked one of the\r\n     regular army officers what the government expected to gain by\r\n     making war on the South. \"Well,\" the officer replied, laying his\r\n     hand on the cannon by which he was standing, \"we intend to use\r\n     these until it is as safe for a Northern man to express his\r\n     political opinions in the South, as it is for a Southern man to\r\n     express his in the North.\" Senator Blaine, at a banquet in\r\n     Trenton, N. J., July 2, declared that a \"government which did not\r\n     offer protection to every citizen in every State had no right to\r\n     demand allegiance.\" Ex-Senator Wade, of Ohio, in a letter to the\r\n     Washington _National Republican_ of July 16, said of the\r\n     president's policy:\r\n\r\n          I greatly fear this policy, under cover of what is called\r\n          local self-government, is but an ignominious surrender of\r\n          the principles of nationality for which our armies fought\r\n          and for which thousands upon thousands of our brave men\r\n          died, and without which the war was a failure and our\r\n          boasted government a myth.\r\n\r\n     Behind the slavery of the colored race was the principle of State\r\n     rights. Their emancipation and enfranchisement were important,\r\n     not only as a vindication of our great republican idea of\r\n     individual rights, but as the first blow in favor of national\r\n     unity--of a consistent, homogeneous government. As all our\r\n     difficulties, State and national, are finally referred to the\r\n     constitution, it is of vital importance that that instrument\r\n     should not be susceptible of a different interpretation from\r\n     every possible standpoint. It is folly to spend another century\r\n     in expounding the equivocal language of the constitution. If\r\n     under that instrument, supposed to be the _Magna Charta_ of\r\n     American liberties, all United States citizens do not stand equal\r\n     before the law, it should without further delay be so amended as\r\n     in plain, unmistakable language to declare what are the rights,\r\n     privileges, and immunities that belong to citizens of a republic.\r\n\r\n     There is no reason why the people of to-day should be governed by\r\n     the laws and constitutions of men long since dead and buried.\r\n     Surely those who understand the vital issues of this hour are\r\n     better able to legislate for the living present than those who\r\n     governed a hundred years ago. If the nineteenth century is to be\r\n     governed by the opinions of the eighteenth, and the twentieth by\r\n     the nineteenth, the world will always be governed by dead men....\r\n\r\n     The cry of centralization could have little significance if the\r\n     constitution were so amended as to protect all United States\r\n     citizens in their inalienable rights. That national supremacy\r\n     that holds individual freedom and equality more sacred than State\r\n     rights and secures representation to all classes of people, is a\r\n     very different form of centralization from that in which all the\r\n     forces of society are centered in a single arm. But the\r\n     recognition of the principle of national supremacy, as declared\r\n     in the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments, has been practically\r\n     nullified and the results of the war surrendered, by remanding\r\n     woman to the States for the protection of her civil and political\r\n     rights. The Supreme Court decisions and the congressional reports\r\n     on this point are in direct conflict with the idea of national\r\n     unity, and the principle of States rights involved in this\r\n     discussion must in time remand all United States citizens alike\r\n     to State authority for the protection of those rights declared to\r\n     inhere in the people at the foundation of the government.\r\n\r\n     You may listen to our demands, gentlemen, with dull ears, and\r\n     smile incredulously at the idea of danger to our institutions\r\n     from continued violation of the civil and political rights of\r\n     women, but the question of what citizens shall enjoy the rights\r\n     of suffrage involves our national existence; for, if the\r\n     constitutional rights of the humblest citizen may be invaded with\r\n     impunity, laws interpreted on the side of injustice, judicial\r\n     decisions based not on reason, sound argument, nor the spirit and\r\n     letter of our declarations and theories of government, but on the\r\n     customs of society and what dead men are supposed to have\r\n     thought, not what they said--what will the rights of the ruling\r\n     powers even be in the future with a people educated into such\r\n     modes of thought and action? The treatment of every individual in\r\n     a community--in our courts, prisons, asylums, of every class of\r\n     petitioners before congress--strengthens or undermines the\r\n     foundations of that temple of liberty whose corner-stones were\r\n     laid one century ago with bleeding hands and anxious hearts, with\r\n     the hardships, privations, and sacrifices of a seven years' war.\r\n     He who is able from the conflicts of the present to forecast the\r\n     future events, cannot but contemplate with anxiety the fate of\r\n     this republic, unless our constitution be at once subjected to a\r\n     thorough emendation, making it more comprehensively democratic.\r\n\r\n     A review of the history of our nation during the century will\r\n     show the American people that all the obstacles that have impeded\r\n     their political, moral and material progress from the dominion of\r\n     slavery down to the present epidemic of political corruptions,\r\n     are directly and indirectly traceable to the federal constitution\r\n     as their source and support. Hence the necessity of prompt and\r\n     appropriate amendments. Nothing that is incorrect in principle\r\n     can ever be productive of beneficial results, and no custom or\r\n     authority is able to alter or overrule this inviolate law of\r\n     development. The catch-phrases of politicians, such as \"organic\r\n     development,\" \"the logic of events,\" and \"things will regulate\r\n     themselves,\" have deceived the thoughtless long enough. There is\r\n     just one road to safety, and that is to understand the law\r\n     governing the situation and to bring the nation in line with it.\r\n     Grave political problems are solved in two ways--by a wise\r\n     forethought, and reformation; or by general dissatisfaction,\r\n     resistance, and revolution.\r\n\r\n     In closing, let me remind you, gentlemen, that woman has not been\r\n     a heedless spectator of all the great events of the century, nor\r\n     a dull listener to the grand debates on human freedom and\r\n     equality. She has learned the lesson of self-sacrifice,\r\n     self-discipline, and self-government in the same school with the\r\n     heroes of American liberty.[29]\r\n\r\n     MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, of New York, corresponding secretary of the\r\n     association, said: _Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the\r\n     Committee_--You have heard the general argument for woman from\r\n     Mrs. Stanton, but there are women here from all parts of the\r\n     Union, and each one feels that she must say a word to show how\r\n     united we stand. It is because we have respect for law that we\r\n     come before you to-day. We recognize the fact that in good law\r\n     lies the security of all our rights, but as woman has been denied\r\n     the constructive rights of the declaration and constitution, she\r\n     is obliged to ask for a direct recognition in the adoption of a\r\n     sixteenth amendment.\r\n\r\n     The first principle of liberty is division of power. In the\r\n     country of the czar or the sultan there is no liberty of thought\r\n     or action. In limited monarchies power is somewhat divided, and\r\n     we find larger liberty and a broader civilization. Coming to the\r\n     United States we find a still greater division of power, a still\r\n     more extended liberty--civil, religious, political. No nation in\r\n     the world is as respected as our own; no title so proud as that\r\n     of American citizen; it carries with it abroad a protection as\r\n     large as did that of Rome two thousand years ago. But as proud as\r\n     is this name of American citizen, it brings with it only shame\r\n     and humiliation to one-half of the nation. Woman has no part nor\r\n     lot in the matter. The pride of citizenship is not for her, for\r\n     woman is still a political slave. While the form of our\r\n     government seems to include the whole people, one-half of them\r\n     are denied a right to participate in its benefits, are denied the\r\n     right of self-government. Woman equally with man has natural\r\n     rights; woman equally with man is a responsible being.\r\n\r\n     It is said women are not fit for freedom. Well, then, secure us\r\n     freedom and make us fit for it. Macaulay said many politicians of\r\n     his time were in the habit of laying it down as a self-evident\r\n     proposition that no people were fit to be free till they were in\r\n     a condition to use their freedom; \"but,\" said Macaulay, \"this\r\n     maxim is worthy of the fool in the old story, who resolved not to\r\n     go into the water till he had learned to swim. If men [or women]\r\n     are to wait for liberty till they become good and wise in\r\n     slavery, they may indeed wait forever.\"\r\n\r\n     There has been much talk about precedent. Many women in this\r\n     country vote upon school questions, and in England at all\r\n     municipal elections. I wish to call your attention a little\r\n     further back, to the time that the Saxons first established free\r\n     government in England. Women, as well as men, took part in the\r\n     Witenagemote, the great national council of our Saxon ancestors\r\n     in England. When Whightred, king of Kent, in the seventh century,\r\n     assembled the national legislature at Baghamstead to enact a new\r\n     code of laws, the queen, abbesses, and many ladies of quality\r\n     signed the decrees. Also, at Beaconsfield, the abbesses took part\r\n     in the council. In the reign of Henry III. four women took seats\r\n     in parliament, and in the reign of Edward I. ten ladies were\r\n     called to parliament and helped to govern Great Britain. Also, in\r\n     1252, Henry left his Queen Elinor as keeper of the great seal, or\r\n     lord chancellor, while he went abroad. She sat in the Aula Regia,\r\n     the highest court of the kingdom, holding the highest judicial\r\n     power in great Britain. Not only among our forefathers in Britain\r\n     do we find that women took part in government, but, going back to\r\n     the Roman Empire, we find the Emperor Heliogabalus introducing\r\n     his mother into the senate, and giving her a seat near the\r\n     consuls. He also established a senate of women, which met on the\r\n     Collis Quirinalis. When Aurelian was emperor he favored the\r\n     representation of women, and determined to revive this senate,\r\n     which in lapse of time had fallen to decay. Plutarch mentions\r\n     that women sat and deliberated in councils, and on questions of\r\n     peace and war. Hence we have precedents extending very far back\r\n     into history.\r\n\r\n     It is sometimes said that women do not desire freedom. But I tell\r\n     you the desire for freedom lives in every heart. It may be hidden\r\n     as the water of the never-freezing, rapid-flowing river Neva is\r\n     hidden. In the winter the ice from Lake Lagoda floats down till\r\n     it is met by the ice setting up from the sea, when they unite and\r\n     form a compact mass over it. Men stand upon it, sledges run over\r\n     it, splendid palaces are built upon it; but beneath all the Neva\r\n     still rapidly flows, itself unfrozen. The presence of these women\r\n     before you shows their desire for freedom. They have come from\r\n     the North, from the South, from the East, from the West, and from\r\n     the far Pacific slope, demanding freedom for themselves and for\r\n     all women.\r\n\r\n     Our demands are often met by the most intolerable tyranny. The\r\n     Albany _Law Journal_, one of the most influential legal journals\r\n     of the great State of New York, had the assurance a few years ago\r\n     to tell Miss Anthony and myself if we were not suited with \"our\r\n     laws\" we could leave the country. What laws did they mean? Men's\r\n     laws. If we were not suited with these men's laws, made by them\r\n     to protect themselves, we could leave the country. We were\r\n     advised to expatriate ourselves, to banish ourselves. But we\r\n     shall not do it. It is our country, and we shall stay here and\r\n     change the laws. We shall secure their amendment, so that under\r\n     them there shall be exact and permanent political equality\r\n     between men and women. Change is not only a law of life; it is an\r\n     essential proof of the existence of life. This country has\r\n     attained its greatness by ever enlarging the bounds of freedom.\r\n\r\n     In our hearts we feel that there is a word sweeter than mother,\r\n     home, or heaven. That word is LIBERTY. We ask it of you now. We\r\n     say to you, secure to us this liberty--the same liberty you have\r\n     yourselves. In doing this you will not render yourselves poor,\r\n     but will make us rich indeed.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. STEWART of Delaware, in illustrating the folly of adverse\r\n     arguments based on woman's ignorance of political affairs, gave\r\n     an amusing account of her colored man servant the first time he\r\n     voted. He had been full of bright anticipations of the coming\r\n     election day, and when it dawned at last, he asked if he could be\r\n     spared from his work an hour or so, to vote. \"Certainly, Jo,\"\r\n     said she, \"by all means; go to the polls and do your duty as a\r\n     citizen.\" Elated with his new-found dignity, Jo ran down the\r\n     road, and with a light heart and shining face deposited his vote.\r\n     On his return Mrs. Stewart questioned him as to his success at\r\n     the polls. \"Well,\" said he, \"first one man nabbed me and gave me\r\n     the tickets he said I ought to vote, and then another man did the\r\n     same. I said yes to both and put the tickets in my pocket. I had\r\n     no use for those Republican or Democratic bits of paper.\" \"Well,\r\n     Jo,\" said Mrs. Stewart, \"what did you do?\" \"Why I took that piece\r\n     of paper that I paid $2.50 for and put it in the box. I knew that\r\n     was worth something.\" \"Alas! Jo,\" said his mistress, \"you voted\r\n     your tax receipt, so your first vote has counted nothing.\" Do you\r\n     think, gentlemen, said Mrs. Stewart, that such women as attend\r\n     our conventions, and speak from our platform, could make so\r\n     ludicrous a blunder? I think not.\r\n\r\n     The Rev. OLYMPIA BROWN, a delegate from Connecticut, addressed\r\n     the committee as follows: _Gentlemen of the Committee_--I would\r\n     not intrude upon your time and exhaust your patience by any\r\n     further hearing upon this subject if it were not that men are\r\n     continually saying to us that we do not want the ballot; that it\r\n     is only a handful of women that have ever asked for it; and I\r\n     think by our coming up from these different States, from\r\n     Delaware, from Oregon, from Missouri, from Connecticut, from New\r\n     Hampshire, and giving our testimony, we shall convince you that\r\n     it is not a few merely, but that it is a general demand from the\r\n     women in all the different States of the Union; and if we come\r\n     here with stammering tongues, causing you to laugh by the very\r\n     absurdity of the manner in which we advocate our opinions, it\r\n     will only convince you that it is not a few \"gifted\" women, but\r\n     the rank and file of the women of our country unaccustomed to\r\n     such proceedings as these, who come here to tell you that we all\r\n     desire the right of suffrage. Nor shall our mistakes and\r\n     inability to advocate our cause in an effective manner be an\r\n     argument against us, because it is not the province of voters to\r\n     conduct meetings in Washington. It is rather their province to\r\n     stay at home and quietly read the proceeding of members of\r\n     congress, and if they find these proceedings correct, to vote to\r\n     return them another year. So that our very mistakes shall argue\r\n     for us and not against us.\r\n\r\n     In the ages past the right of citizenship meant the right to\r\n     enjoy or possess or attain all those civil and political rights\r\n     that are enjoyed by any other citizen. But here we have a class\r\n     who can bear the burdens and punishments of citizens, but cannot\r\n     enjoy their privileges and rights. But even the meanest may\r\n     petition, and so we come with our thousands of petitions, asking\r\n     you to protect us against the unjust discriminations imposed by\r\n     State laws. Nor do we find that there is any conflict between the\r\n     duties of the national government and the functions of the State.\r\n     The United States government has to do with general interests,\r\n     but everything that is special, has to do with sectional\r\n     interests, belongs to the State. Said Charles Sumner:\r\n\r\n          The State exercises its proper functions when it makes local\r\n          laws, promotes local charities, and by its local knowledge\r\n          brings the guardianship of government to the homes of its\r\n          citizens; but the State transcends its proper functions when\r\n          in any manner it interferes with those equal rights recorded\r\n          in the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\n     The State is local, the United States is universal. And, says\r\n     Charles Sumner, \"What can be more universal than the rights of\r\n     man?\" I would add, \"What can be more universal than the rights of\r\n     woman?\" extending further than the rights of man, because woman\r\n     is the heaven-appointed guardian of the home; because woman by\r\n     her influence and in her office as an educator makes the\r\n     character of man; because women are to be found wherever men are\r\n     to be found, as their mothers bringing them into the world,\r\n     watching them, teaching them, guiding them into manhood. Wherever\r\n     there is a home, wherever there is a human interest, there is to\r\n     be felt the interest of women, and so this cause is the most\r\n     universal of any cause under the sun; and, therefore, it has a\r\n     claim upon the general government. Therefore we come petitioning\r\n     that you will protect us in our rights, by aiding us in the\r\n     passage of the sixteenth amendment, which will make the\r\n     constitution plain in our favor, or by such actions as will\r\n     enable us to cast our ballots at the polls without being\r\n     interfered with by State authorities. And we hope you will do\r\n     this at no distant day. I hope you will not send my sister, the\r\n     honorable lady from Delaware, to the boy, Jo, to ask him to\r\n     define her position in the republic. I hope you will not bid any\r\n     of these women at home to ask ignorant men whether they may be\r\n     allowed to discharge their obligations as citizens in the matter\r\n     of suffrage. I hope you will not put your wives and mothers in\r\n     the power of men who have never given a half hour's consideration\r\n     to the subject of government, and who are wholly unfit to\r\n     exercise their judgment as to whether women should have the right\r\n     of suffrage.\r\n\r\n     I will not insult your common sense by bringing up the old\r\n     arguments as to whether we have the right to vote. I believe\r\n     every man of you knows we have that right--that our right to vote\r\n     is based upon the same authority as yours. I believe every man\r\n     understands that, according to the declaration and the\r\n     constitution, women should be allowed to exercise the right of\r\n     suffrage, and therefore it is not necessary for me to do more\r\n     than bear my testimony from the State of Connecticut, and tell\r\n     you that the women from the rank and file, the law-abiding women,\r\n     desire the ballot; not only that they desire it, but they mean\r\n     to have it. And to accomplish this result I need not remind you\r\n     that they will work year in and year out, that they will besiege\r\n     members of congress everywhere, and that they will come here year\r\n     after year asking you to protect them in their rights and to see\r\n     that justice is done in the republic. Therefore, for your own\r\n     peace, we hope you will not keep us waiting a long time. The fact\r\n     that some States have made, temporarily, some good laws, does not\r\n     weaken our demand upon you for the protection which the ballot\r\n     gives to every citizen. Our interests are still uncared for, and\r\n     we do not wish to be thus sent from pillar to post to get our\r\n     rights. We wish to take our stand as citizens of the United\r\n     States, as we have been declared to be by the Supreme Court, and\r\n     we wish to be protected in the rights of citizenship. We hope the\r\n     day is at hand when our prayers will be heard by you. Let us have\r\n     at an early day in the _Congressional Record_, a report of the\r\n     proceedings of this committee, and the action of the Senate in\r\n     favor of woman's right to vote.\r\n\r\nBrief remarks were also made by Mrs. Lawrence of Massachusetts,\r\nMary A. Thompson, M. D., of Oregon, Mary Powers Filley of New\r\nHampshire, Mrs. Blake of New York, Mrs. Hooker of Connecticut, and\r\nSara Andrews Spencer of Washington.\r\n\r\nAt the close of these two day's hearings before the Committee on\r\nPrivileges and Elections,[30] Senator Hoar of Massachusetts,\r\noffered, and the committee adopted the following complimentary\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the arguments upon the very important questions\r\n     discussed before the committee have been presented with\r\n     propriety, dignity and ability, and that the committee will\r\n     consider the same on Tuesday next, at 10 A.M.\r\n\r\nThe Washington _Evening Star_ of January 11, 1876, said:\r\n\r\n     The woman suffrage question will be a great political issue some\r\n     day. A movement in the direction of alleged rights by a body of\r\n     American citizens cannot be forever checked, even though its\r\n     progress may for many years be very gradual. Now that the\r\n     advocates of suffrage for woman have become convinced that the\r\n     thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments are not\r\n     sufficiently explicit to make woman's right to vote unquestioned,\r\n     and that a sixteenth amendment is necessary to effect the\r\n     practical exercise of the right, the millennial period that they\r\n     look for is to all intents and purposes indefinitely postponed,\r\n     for constitutional amendments are not passed in a day. But there\r\n     are so many sound arguments to be advanced in favor of woman\r\n     suffrage that it cannot fail in time to be weighed as a matter of\r\n     policy, after it shall have been overwhelmingly conceded as a\r\n     matter of right. And it is noticeable that the arguments of the\r\n     opponents are coming more and more to be based on expediency, and\r\n     hardly attempt to answer the claim that as American citizens\r\n     women are entitled to the right. If the whole body of American\r\n     women desired the practical exercise of this right, it is hard to\r\n     see what valid opposition to their claims could be made. All this\r\n     however does not amend the constitution. Woman suffrage must\r\n     become a matter of policy for a political party before it can be\r\n     realized. Congress does not pass revolutionary measures on\r\n     abstract considerations of right. This question is of a nature to\r\n     become a living political issue after it has been sufficiently\r\n     ridiculed.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday evening, January 12, a reception was given to the\r\ndelegates to the convention by Hon. Alexander H. Stephens of\r\nGeorgia, at the National Hotel. The suite of rooms so long occupied\r\nby this liberal representative of the South, was thus opened to\r\nunwonted guests--women asking for the same rights gained at the\r\npoint of the sword by his former slaves! Seated in his wheel-chair,\r\nfrom which he had so often been carried by a faithful attendant to\r\nhis place in the House of Representatives, he cordially welcomed\r\nthe ladies as they gathered about him, assuring them of his\r\ninterest in this question and promising his aid.\r\n\r\nFor the first time Miss Julia Smith of anti-tax fame, of\r\nGlastonbury, Connecticut, was present at a Washington convention.\r\nShe was the recipient of much social attention. A reception was\r\ntendered her by Mrs. Spofford of the Riggs House, giving people an\r\nopportunity to meet this heroic woman of eighty-three, who, with\r\nher younger sister Abby, had year after year suffered the sale of\r\ntheir fine Jersey cows and beautiful meadow lands, rather than pay\r\ntaxes while unrepresented. Many women, notable in art, science and\r\nliterature, and men high in political station were present on this\r\noccasion. All crowded about Miss Smith, as, supported by Mrs.\r\nHooker, in response to a call for a speech, particularly in regard\r\nto the Gladstonbury cows, as famous as herself, she said:\r\n\r\n     There are but two of our cows left at present, Taxey and Votey.\r\n     It is something a little peculiar that Taxey is very obtrusive;\r\n     why, I can scarcely step out of doors without being confronted by\r\n     her, while Votey is quiet and shy, but she is growing more docile\r\n     and domesticated every day, and it is my opinion that in a very\r\n     short time, wherever you find Taxey there Votey will be also.\r\n\r\nAt the close of Miss Smith's remarks, Abby Hutchinson Patton sang\r\n\"Auld Lang Syne\" in a very effective manner; one or two readings\r\nfollowed, a few modern ballads were sung, and thus closed the\r\nfirst of the many delightful receptions given by Mr. and Mrs.\r\nSpofford to the officers and members of the National Association.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hooker spent several weeks at the Riggs House, holding\r\nfrequent woman suffrage conversazioni in its elegant parlors; also\r\nspeaking upon the question at receptions given in her honor by the\r\nwives of members of congress, or residents of Washington.[31]\r\n\r\nDuring the week of the convention, public attention was called to a\r\nscarcely known Anti-Woman Suffrage Society, formed in 1871, of\r\nwhich Mrs. General Sherman, Mrs. Admiral Dahlgren and Mrs. Almira\r\nLincoln Phelps were officers, by the publication of an undelivered\r\nletter from Mrs. Phelps to Mrs. Hooker:\r\n\r\n     _To the Editor of the Post:_\r\n\r\n     The following was written nearly seven years since, but was never\r\n     sent to Mrs. Hooker. The letter chanced to appear among old\r\n     papers, and as there is a meeting of women suffragists, with Mrs.\r\n     Hooker present, and, moreover, as they have mentioned the names\r\n     of Mrs. Dahlgren and Mrs. General Sherman, opposers, I am willing\r\n     to bear my share of the opposition, as I acted as corresponding\r\n     secretary to the Anti-Suffrage Society, which was formed under\r\n     the auspices of these ladies.\r\n\r\n                                             Mrs. DAHLGREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         EUTAW PLACE, BALTIMORE, January, 30, 1871.\r\n\r\n     _To Mrs. Beecher Hooker:_\r\n\r\n     DEAR MADAM--Hoping you will receive kindly what I am about to\r\n     write, I will proceed without apologies. I have confidence in\r\n     your nobleness of soul, and that you know enough of me to believe\r\n     in my devotion to the best interests of woman. I can scarcely\r\n     realize that you are giving your name and influence to a cause,\r\n     which, with some good but, as I think, misguided women, numbers\r\n     among its advocates others with loose morals. * * * We are, my\r\n     dear madam, as I suppose, related through our common ancester\r\n     Thomas Hooker. * * * Your husband, I believe, stands in the same\r\n     relation to that good and noble man. Perhaps he may think with\r\n     you on this woman suffrage question, but it does seem to me that\r\n     a wife honoring her husband would not wish to join in such a\r\n     crusade as is now going on to put woman on an equality with the\r\n     rabble at the \"hustings.\" If we could with propriety petition the\r\n     Almighty to change the condition of the sexes and let men take a\r\n     turn in bearing children and in suffering the physical ailments\r\n     peculiar to women, which render them unfit for certain positions\r\n     and business, why, in this case, if we really wish to be men, and\r\n     thought God would change the established order, we might make our\r\n     petition; but why ask congress to make us men? Circumstances drew\r\n     me from the quiet of domestic life while I was yet young; but\r\n     success in labors which involved publicity, and which may have\r\n     been of advantage to society, was never considered as an\r\n     equivalent to my own heart for the loss of such retirement. In\r\n     the name of my sainted sister, Emma Willard, and of my friend\r\n     Lydia Sigourney, and I think I might say in the name of the women\r\n     of the past generation, who have been prominent as writers and\r\n     educators (the exception may be made of Mary Wollstonecraft,\r\n     Frances Wright, and a few licentious French writers) in our own\r\n     country and in Europe, let me urge the high-souled and honorable\r\n     of our sex to turn their energies into that channel which will\r\n     enable them to act for the true interests of their sex.\r\n\r\n                         Yours respectfully,\r\n                                             ALMIRA LINCOLN PHELPS.\r\n\r\nTo which Mrs. Hooker, through _The Post_, replied:\r\n\r\n                                   WASHINGTON, January 15, 1878.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. DAHLGREN--_Dear Madam_: Permit me to thank you for the\r\n     opportunity to exonerate myself and the women of the suffrage\r\n     movement all over the United States from the charge of favoring\r\n     immorality in any form. I did not know before that Mrs. Phelps,\r\n     whom I have always held in highest esteem as an educator and as\r\n     one of the most advanced thinkers of her day, had so misconceived\r\n     the drift of our movement; and you will pardon me, dear madam,\r\n     for saying that it is hardly possible that Mrs. Sherman and\r\n     yourself, in your opposition to it, can have been influenced by\r\n     any apprehension that the women suffragists of the United States\r\n     would, if entrusted with legislative power, proceed to use it for\r\n     the desecration of their own sex, and the pollution of the souls\r\n     of their husbands, brothers and sons. But having been publicly\r\n     accused through your instrumentality of sympathy with the\r\n     licentious practices of men, I shall take the liberty to send you\r\n     a dozen copies of a little book entitled, \"Womanhood; its\r\n     Sanctities and Fidelities,\" which I published in 1874 for the\r\n     specific purpose of bringing to the notice of American women the\r\n     wonderful work being done across the water in the suppression of\r\n     \"State Patronage of Vice.\" * * * It is with a deep sense of\r\n     gratitude to God that I am able to say that, according to my\r\n     knowledge and belief, every woman in our movement, whether\r\n     officer or private, is in sympathy with the spirit of this little\r\n     book. I know of no inharmony here, however we may differ upon\r\n     minor points of expediency as to the best methods of working for\r\n     the political advancement of woman. And further, it is the deep\r\n     conviction of us all that the chief stumbling-block in the way of\r\n     our obtaining the use of the ballot, is the apprehension among\r\n     men of low degree that they will surely be limited in their base\r\n     and brutal and sensual indulgencies when women are armed with\r\n     equal political power.\r\n\r\n     As to my husband, to whose ancestry Mrs. Phelps so kindly\r\n     alludes, permit me to say that he is not only descended from\r\n     Thomas Hooker, the beloved first pastor of the old Centre Church\r\n     in Hartford, and founder of the State of Connecticut, but further\r\n     back his lineage takes root in one of England's most honored\r\n     names, Richard Hooker, surnamed \"The Judicious\"; and I have been\r\n     accustomed to say that, however it may be as to learning and\r\n     position, the characteristic of judiciousness has not departed\r\n     from the American stock. I will only add that Mr. Hooker is\r\n     treasurer of our State suffrage association, and has spoken on\r\n     the platform with me as president, whenever his professional\r\n     duties would permit, and that he is the author of a tract on \"The\r\n     Bible and Woman Suffrage.\" Our society has printed several\r\n     thousand copies of this tract, and the London National Women's\r\n     Suffrage Society has reprinted it with words of high commendation\r\n     for distribution in Great Britain. * * * And now, dear madam,\r\n     thanking you once more for this most unexpected and most grateful\r\n     opportunity for correcting misapprehensions that others may have\r\n     entertained as well as Mrs. Phelps in regard to the design and\r\n     tendencies of our movement, may I not ask that you will kindly\r\n     read and consider the papers I shall take the liberty to send\r\n     you, and hand them to your co-workers at your convenience?\r\n\r\n     That we all, as women who love our country and our kind, may be\r\n     led to honor each other in our personal relations, while we work\r\n     each in her respective way for that higher order of manhood and\r\n     womanhood that alone can exalt our nation to the ideal of the\r\n     fathers and mothers of the early republic, and preserve us an\r\n     honored place among the peoples of the earth, is the prayer of\r\n\r\n                                   Yours sincerely,\r\n                                         ISABELLA BEECHER HOOKER.\r\n\r\nEvidently left without even the name of Mrs. Sherman or the\r\nAnti-Suffrage Society to sustain her, Mrs. Dahlgren memorialized\r\nthe Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections against the\r\nsubmission of the sixteenth amendment:\r\n\r\n     _To the Honorable Committee on Privileges and Elections:_\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN--Allow me, in courtesy, as a petitioner, to present one\r\n     or two considerations regarding a sixteenth amendment, by which\r\n     it is proposed to confer the right of suffrage upon the women of\r\n     the United States. I ask this favor also in the interests of the\r\n     masses of silent women, whose silence does not give consent, but\r\n     who, in most modest earnestness, deprecate having the political\r\n     life forced upon them.\r\n\r\n     This grave question is not one of simple expediency or the\r\n     reverse; it might properly be held, were this the case, as a\r\n     legitimate subject for agitation. Our reasons of dissent to this\r\n     dangerous inroad upon all precedent, lie deeper and strike\r\n     higher. They are based upon that which in all Christian nations\r\n     must be recognized as the higher law, the fundamental law upon\r\n     which Christian society in its very construction must rest; and\r\n     that law, as defined by the Almighty, is immutable. Through it\r\n     the women of this Christian land, as mothers, wives, sisters,\r\n     daughters, have distinct duties to perform of the most complex\r\n     order, yet of the very highest and most sacred nature.\r\n\r\n     If in addition to all these responsibilities, others,\r\n     appertaining to the domain assigned to men, are allotted to us,\r\n     we shall be made the victims of an oppression not intended by a\r\n     kind and wise Providence, and from which the refining influences\r\n     of Christian civilization have emancipated us. We have but to\r\n     look at the condition of our Indian sister, upon whose bended\r\n     back the heavy pack is laid by her lord and master; who treads in\r\n     subjection the beaten pathway of equal rights, and compare her\r\n     situation with our own, to thank the God of Christian nations who\r\n     has placed us above that plane, where right is might, and might\r\n     is tyranny. We cannot without prayer and protest see our\r\n     cherished privileges endangered, and have granted us only in\r\n     exchange the so-called equal rights. We need more, and we claim,\r\n     through our physical weakness and your courtesy as Christian\r\n     gentlemen, that protection which we need for the proper discharge\r\n     of those sacred and inalienable functions and rights conferred\r\n     upon us by God. To these the vote, which is not a natural right\r\n     (otherwise why not confer it upon idiots, lunatics, and adult\r\n     boys) would be adverse.\r\n\r\n     When women ask for a distinct political life, a separate vote,\r\n     they forget or they willfully ignore the higher law, whose logic\r\n     may be thus condensed: Marriage is a sacred unity. The family,\r\n     through it, is the foundation of the State. Each family is\r\n     represented by its head, just as the State ultimately finds the\r\n     same unity, through a series of representations. Out of this come\r\n     peace, concord, proper representation, and adjustment--union.\r\n\r\n     The new doctrine, which is illusive, may be thus defined:\r\n     Marriage is a mere compact, and means diversity. Each family,\r\n     therefore, must have a separate individual representation, out of\r\n     which arises diversity or division, and discord is the\r\n     corner-stone of the State.\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen, we cannot displace the corner-stone without\r\n     destruction to the edifice itself! The subject is so vast, has so\r\n     many side issues, that a volume might as readily be laid before\r\n     your honorable committee as these few words hastily written with\r\n     an aching woman's heart. Personally, if any woman in this vast\r\n     land has a grievance by not having a vote, I may claim that\r\n     grievance to be mine. With father, brother, husband, son, taken\r\n     away by death, I stand utterly alone, with minor children to\r\n     educate and considerable property interests to guard. But I would\r\n     deem it unpatriotic to ask for a general law which must prove\r\n     disastrous to my country, in order to meet that exceptional\r\n     position in which, by the adorable will of God, I am placed. I\r\n     prefer, indeed, to trust to that moral influence over men which\r\n     intelligence never fails to exercise, and which is really more\r\n     potent in the management of business affairs than the direct\r\n     vote. In this I am doubtless as old-fashioned as were our\r\n     grandmothers, who assisted to mold this vast republic. They knew\r\n     that the greatest good for the greatest number was the only safe\r\n     legislative law, and that to it all exceptional cases must\r\n     submit.\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen, in conclusion, a sophism in legislation is not a mere\r\n     abstraction; it must speedily bear fruit in material results of\r\n     the most disastrous nature, and I implore your honorable\r\n     committee, in behalf of our common country, not to open a\r\n     Pandora's box by way of experiment from whence so much evil must\r\n     issue, and which once opened may never again be closed.\r\n\r\n                                   Very respectfully,\r\n                                          MADELEINE VINTON DAHLGREN.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dahlgren was ably reviewed by Virginia L. Minor of St. Louis,\r\nand the Toledo Woman Suffrage Association. Mrs. Minor said:\r\n\r\n     In assuming to speak for the \"silent masses\" of women, Mrs.\r\n     Dahlgren declares that silence does not give consent; very\r\n     inconsequently forgetting, that if it does not on one side of the\r\n     question, it may not on the other, and that she may no more\r\n     represent them than do we.\r\n\r\nThe Toledo society, through its president Mrs. Rose L. Segur, said:\r\n\r\n     We agree with you that this grave question is not one of\r\n     expediency. It is simply one of right and justice, and therefore\r\n     a most legitimate subject for agitation. As a moral force woman\r\n     must have a voice in the government, or partial and unjust\r\n     legislation is the result from which arise the evils consequent\r\n     upon a government based upon the enslavement of half its\r\n     citizens.\r\n\r\nTo this Mrs. Dahlgren replied briefly, charging the ladies with\r\nincapacity to comprehend her.\r\n\r\nThe week following the convention a hearing was granted by the\r\nHouse Judiciary Committee to Dr. Mary Walker of Washington, Mary A.\r\nTillotson of New Jersey and Mrs. N. Cromwell of Arkansas, urging a\r\nreport in favor of woman's enfranchisement. On January 28, the\r\nHouse sub-committee on territories granted a hearing to Dr. Mary\r\nWalker and Sara Andrews Spencer, in opposition to the bill\r\nproposing the disfranchisement of the women of Utah as a means of\r\nsuppressing polygamy.\r\n\r\nOn January 30 the House Judiciary Committee granted Mrs. Hooker a\r\nhearing. Of the eleven members of the committee nearly all were\r\npresent.[32] The room and all the corridors leading to it were\r\ncrowded with men and women eager to hear Mrs. Hooker's speech. At\r\nthe close of the two hours occupied in its delivery, Chairman Knott\r\nthanked her in the name of the committee for her able argument.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this hearing Mr. Frye of Maine, in presenting in\r\nthe House of Representatives the petitions of 30,000 persons asking\r\nthe right of women to vote upon the question of temperance,\r\nreferred in a very complimentary manner to Mrs. Hooker's argument,\r\nto which he had just listened. Upon this prayer a hearing was\r\ngranted to the president and ex-president of the Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union, Frances E. Willard and Annie E. Wittenmyer.\r\n\r\nHon. George F. Hoar of Massachusetts, February 4, presented in the\r\nSenate the 120 petitions with their 6,261 signatures, which, by\r\nspecial request of its officers, had been returned to the\r\nheadquarters of the American Association, in Boston. In her appeal\r\nto the friends to circulate the petitions, both State and national,\r\nLucy Stone, chairman of its executive committee, said:\r\n\r\n     The American Suffrage Association has always recommended\r\n     petitions to congress for a sixteenth amendment. But it\r\n     recognizes the far greater importance of petitioning the State\r\n     legislatures. _First_--Because suffrage is a subject referred by\r\n     the constitution to the voters of each State. _Second_--Because\r\n     we cannot expect a congress composed solely of representatives of\r\n     States which deny suffrage to women, to submit an amendment which\r\n     their own States have not yet approved. Just so it would have\r\n     been impossible to secure the submission of negro suffrage by a\r\n     congress composed solely of representatives from States which\r\n     restricted suffrage to white men. While therefore we advise our\r\n     friends to circulate both petitions together for signature, we\r\n     urge them to give special prominence to those which apply to\r\n     their own State legislatures, and to see that these are presented\r\n     and urged by competent speakers next winter.\r\n\r\nBy request of a large number of the senators,[33] the Committee on\r\nPrivileges and Elections granted a special hearing to Mrs. Hooker\r\non Washington's birthday--February 22, 1878. It being understood\r\nthat the wives of the senators were bringing all the forces of\r\nfashionable society to bear in aid of Mrs. Dahlgren's protest\r\nagainst the pending sixteenth amendment, the officers of the\r\nNational Association issued cards of invitation asking their\r\npresence at this hearing. We copy from the Washington _Post_:\r\n\r\n     The conflicting rumors as to who would be admitted to hear Mrs.\r\n     Hooker's argument before the Senate Committee on Privileges and\r\n     Elections, led to the assembling of large numbers of women in\r\n     various places about the capitol yesterday morning. At 11 o'clock\r\n     the doors were opened and the committee-room at once filled.[34]\r\n     Mrs. Hooker, with the fervor and eloquence of her family,\r\n     reviewed all the popular arguments against woman suffrage. She\r\n     said she once believed that twenty years was little time enough\r\n     for a foreigner to live in this country before he could cast a\r\n     ballot. She understands the spirit of our institutions better\r\n     now. If disfranchisement meant annihilation, there might be\r\n     safety in disfranchising the poor, the ignorant, the vicious. But\r\n     it does not. It means danger to everything we hold dear.\r\n\r\n     The corner-stone of this republic is God's own doctrine of\r\n     liberty and responsibility. Liberty is the steam, responsibility\r\n     the brakes, and election-day, the safety-valve. The foreigner\r\n     comes to this country expecting to find it a paradise. He finds,\r\n     indeed, a ladder reaching to the skies, but resting upon the\r\n     earth, and he is at the bottom round. But on one day in the year\r\n     he is as good as the richest man in the land. He can make the\r\n     banker stand in the line behind him until he votes, and if he has\r\n     wrongs he learns how to right them. If he has mistaken ideas of\r\n     liberty, he is instructed what freedom means.\r\n\r\n     Wire-pulling politicians may well fear to have women\r\n     enfranchised. There are too many of them, and they have had too\r\n     much experience in looking after the details of their households\r\n     to be easily duped by the tricks of politicians. You can't keep\r\n     women away from primary meetings as you do intelligent men. Women\r\n     know that every corner in the house must be inspected if the\r\n     house is to be clean. Fathers and brothers want women to vote so\r\n     that they can have a decent place for a primary meeting, a decent\r\n     place to vote in and a decent man to vote for.\r\n\r\n     The Indian question would have been peacefully and righteously\r\n     settled long ago without any standing army, if Lucretia Mott\r\n     could have led in the councils of the nation, and the millions\r\n     spent in fighting the Indians might have been used in\r\n     kindergartens for the poor, to some lasting benefit. Down with\r\n     the army, down with appropriation bills to repair the\r\n     consequences of wrong-doing, when women vote. Millions more of\r\n     women would ask for this if it were not for the cruelty and abuse\r\n     men have heaped upon the advocates of woman suffrage. Men have\r\n     made it a terrible martyrdom for women even to ask for their\r\n     rights, and then say to us, \"convert the women.\" No, no, men have\r\n     put up the bars. They must take them down. Mrs. Hooker reviewed\r\n     the Chinese question, the labor question, the subjects of\r\n     compulsory education, reformation, police regulations, the social\r\n     evil, and many other topics upon which men vainly attempt to\r\n     legislate without the loving wisdom of mothers, sisters and\r\n     daughters. The senators most interested in the argument were\r\n     observed to be those previously most unfriendly to woman\r\n     suffrage.\r\n\r\nIt was during this winter that Marilla M. Ricker of New Hampshire,\r\nthen studying criminal law in Washington and already having quite\r\nan extensive practice, applied to the commissioners of the District\r\nof Columbia for an appointment as notary public. The question of\r\nthe eligibility of woman to the office was referred to the\r\ndistrict-attorney, Hon. Albert G. Riddle, formerly a member of\r\ncongress from Ohio, and at that time one of the most prominent\r\ncriminal and civil lawyers before the bar. Mr. Riddle's reply was\r\nan able and exhaustive argument, clearly showing there was no law\r\nto prevent women from holding the office. But notwithstanding this\r\nopinion from their own attorney, the commissioners rejected Mrs.\r\nRicker's application.[35]\r\n\r\nBills to prohibit the Supreme Court from denying the admission of\r\nlawyers on the ground of sex had been introduced at each session of\r\ncongress during the past four years. The House bill No. 1,077,\r\nentitled \"A bill to relieve certain disabilities of women,\" was\r\nthis year championed by Hon. John M. Glover of Missouri, and passed\r\nby a vote of 169 ayes to 87 nays. In the Senate, Hon. George F.\r\nEdmunds of Vermont, chairman of the Judiciary Committee reported\r\nadversely. While the question was pending, Mrs. Lockwood addressed\r\na brief to the Senate, ably refuting the assertion of the Court\r\nthat it was contrary to English precedent:\r\n\r\n     _To the Honorable, the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\n     The provisions of this bill are so stringent, that to the\r\n     ordinary mind it would seem that the conditions are hard enough\r\n     for the applicant to have well earned the honor of the\r\n     preferment, without making _sex_ a disability. The fourteenth\r\n     amendment to the constitution declares that:\r\n\r\n          All persons born or naturalized in the United States and\r\n          subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are _citizens_ of the\r\n          United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State\r\n          shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the\r\n          privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\r\n          Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or\r\n          property without due process of law, nor deny to any person\r\n          within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\r\n\r\n     To deny the right asked in this bill would be to deny to women\r\n     citizens the rights guaranteed in the Declaration of Independence\r\n     to be self-evident and inalienable, \"life, liberty and the\r\n     pursuit of happiness\"; a denial of one of the fundamental rights\r\n     of a portion of the citizens of the commonwealth to acquire\r\n     property in the most honorable profession of the law, thereby\r\n     perpetuating an invidious distinction between male and female\r\n     citizens equally amenable to the law, and having an equal\r\n     interest in all of the institutions created and perpetuated by\r\n     this government. The articles of confederation declare that:\r\n\r\n          The free inhabitants of each of these States--paupers and\r\n          fugitives from justice excepted--shall be entitled to all\r\n          privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several\r\n          States.\r\n\r\n     Article 4 of the constitution says:\r\n\r\n          Full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the\r\n          public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every\r\n          other State.\r\n\r\n     Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Wyoming,\r\n     Utah, and the District of Columbia admit women to the bar. What\r\n     then? Shall the second cooerdinate branch of the government, the\r\n     judiciary, refuse to grant what it will not permit the States to\r\n     deny, the privileges and immunities of citizens, and say to\r\n     women-attorneys when they have followed their cases through the\r\n     State courts to that tribunal beyond which there is no appeal,\r\n     \"You cannot come in here we are too holy,\" or in the words of the\r\n     learned chancellor declare that:\r\n\r\n          By the uniform practice of the court from its organization\r\n          to the present time, and by a fair construction of its\r\n          rules, none but men are admitted to practice before it as\r\n          attorneys and counselors. This is in accordance with\r\n          immemorial usage in England, and the law and practice in all\r\n          the States until within a recent period, and the court does\r\n          not feel called upon to make a change until such a change is\r\n          required by statute, or a more extended practice in the\r\n          highest courts of the States.\r\n\r\n     With all due respect for this opinion, we beg leave to quote the\r\n     rule for admission to the bar of that court as laid down in the\r\n     rule book:\r\n\r\n          RULE NO. 2.--_Attorneys_: It shall be requisite to the\r\n          admission of attorneys or counselors to practice in this\r\n          court, that they shall have been such for three years past\r\n          in the Supreme Courts of the States to which they\r\n          respectively belong, and that their private and professional\r\n          character shall appear to be fair.\r\n\r\n     There is nothing in this rule or in the oath which follows it,\r\n     either express or implied, which confines the membership of the\r\n     bar of the United States Supreme Court to the male sex. Had any\r\n     such term been included therein it would virtually be nullified\r\n     by the first paragraph of the United States Revised Statutes,\r\n     ratified by the forty-third congress, June 20, 1875, in which\r\n     occur the following words:\r\n\r\n          In determining the meaning of the Revised Statutes, or of\r\n          any act or resolution of congress passed subsequent to\r\n          February 25, 1871, words importing the singular number may\r\n          extend and be applied to several persons or things; words\r\n          importing the masculine gender may be applied to _females_,\r\n          etc., etc.\r\n\r\n     Now, as to \"immemorial usage in England.\" The executive branch of\r\n     that government has been vested in an honored and honorable woman\r\n     for the past forty years. Is it to be supposed if this\r\n     distinguished lady or any one of her accomplished daughters\r\n     should ask to be heard at the bar of the Court of the Queen's\r\n     Bench, the practice of which the United States Supreme Court has\r\n     set up as its model, that she would be refused?\r\n\r\n     Blackstone recounts that Ann, Countess of Pembroke, held the\r\n     office of sheriff of Westmoreland and exercised its duties in\r\n     person. At the assizes at Appleby she sat with the judges on the\r\n     bench. (See Coke on Lit., p. 326.) The Scotch sheriff is properly\r\n     a judge, and by the statute 20, Geo., II, c. 43, he must be a\r\n     lawyer of three years standing.\r\n\r\n     Eleanor, Queen of Henry III. of England, in the year 1253, was\r\n     appointed lady-keeper of the great seal, or the supreme\r\n     chancellor of England, and sat in the _Aula Regia_, or King's\r\n     Court. She in turn appointed Kilkenny, arch-deacon of Coventry,\r\n     as the sealer of writs and common-law instruments, but the more\r\n     important matters she executed in person.\r\n\r\n     Queen Elizabeth held the great seal at three several times during\r\n     her remarkable reign. After the death of Lord-keeper Bacon she\r\n     presided for two months in the _Aula Regia_.\r\n\r\n     It is claimed that \"admission to the bar constitutes an office.\"\r\n     Every woman postmaster, pension agent and notary public\r\n     throughout the land is a bonded officer of the government. The\r\n     Western States have elected women as school superintendents and\r\n     appointed them as enrolling and engrossing clerks in their\r\n     several legislatures, and as State librarians. Of what use are\r\n     our seminaries and colleges for women if after they have passed\r\n     through the curriculum of the schools there is for them no\r\n     preferment, and no emolument; no application of the knowledge of\r\n     the arts and sciences acquired, and no recognition of the\r\n     excellence attained?\r\n\r\n     But this country, now in the second year of the second century of\r\n     her history, is no longer in her leading strings, that she should\r\n     look to Mother England for a precedent to do justice to the\r\n     daughters of the land. She had to make a precedent when the first\r\n     male lawyer was admitted to the bar of the United States Supreme\r\n     Court. Ah! this country is one that has not hesitated when the\r\n     necessity has arisen to make precedents and write them in blood.\r\n     There was no precedent for this free republican government and\r\n     the war of the rebellion; no precedent for the emancipation of\r\n     the slave; no precedent for the labor strikes of last summer. The\r\n     more extended practice, and the more extended public opinion\r\n     referred to by the learned chancellor have already been\r\n     accomplished. Ah! that very opinion, telegraphed throughout the\r\n     land by the associated press, brought back the response of the\r\n     people as on the wings of the wind asking you for that special\r\n     act now so nearly consummated, which shall open this professional\r\n     door to women.\r\n\r\n                          BELVA A. LOCKWOOD, _Attorney and Solicitor_.\r\n     _Washington, D. C._, March 7, 1878.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lockwood's bill, with Senator Edmond's adverse report, was\r\nreached on the Senate calendar April 22, 1878, and provoked a\r\nspirited discussion. Hon. A. A. Sargent, made a gallant fight in\r\nfavor of the bill, introducing the following amendment:\r\n\r\n          No person shall be excluded from practicing as an attorney\r\n          and counselor at law in any court of the United States on\r\n          account of sex.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SARGENT: Mr. President, the best evidence that members of the\r\n     legal profession have no jealousy against the admission of women\r\n     to the bar who have the proper learning, is shown by this\r\n     document which I hold in my hand, signed by one hundred and\r\n     fifty-five lawyers of the District of Columbia, embracing the\r\n     most eminent men in the ranks of that profession. That there is\r\n     no jealousy or consideration of impropriety on the part of the\r\n     various States is shown by the fact that the legislatures of many\r\n     of the States have recently admitted women to the bar; and my own\r\n     State, California, has passed such a law within the last week or\r\n     two; Illinois has done the same thing; so have Michigan,\r\n     Minnesota, Missouri and North Carolina; and Wyoming, Utah and the\r\n     District of Columbia among the territories have also done it.\r\n     There is no reason in principle why women should not be admitted\r\n     to this profession or the profession of medicine, provided they\r\n     have the learning to enable them to be useful in those\r\n     professions, and useful to themselves. Where is the propriety in\r\n     opening our colleges, our higher institutions of learning, or any\r\n     institutions of learning, to women, and then when they have\r\n     acquired in the race with men the cultivation for higher\r\n     employment, to shut them out? There certainly is none. We should\r\n     either restrict the laws allowing the liberal education of women,\r\n     or, we should allow them to exercise the talents which are\r\n     cultivated at the public expense in such departments of\r\n     enterprise and knowledge as will be useful to society and will\r\n     enable them to gain a living. The tendency is in this direction.\r\n     I believe the time has passed to consider it a ridiculous thing\r\n     for women to appear upon the lecture platform or in the pulpit,\r\n     for women to attend to the treatment of diseases as physicians\r\n     and nurses, to engage in any literary employment, or appear at\r\n     the bar. Some excellent women in the United States are now\r\n     practicing at the bar, acceptably received before courts and\r\n     juries; and when they have conducted their cases to a successful\r\n     issue or an unsuccessful one in any court below, why should the\r\n     United States courts to which an appeal may be taken and where\r\n     their adversaries of the male sex may follow the case up, why\r\n     should these courts be closed to these women? * * *\r\n\r\n     Mr. GARLAND: I should like to ask the senator from California if\r\n     the courts of the United States cannot admit them upon their own\r\n     motion anyhow?\r\n\r\n     Mr. SARGENT: I think there is nothing in the law prohibiting it,\r\n     but the Supreme Court of the United States recently in passing\r\n     upon the question of the admission of a certain lady, said that\r\n     until some legislation took place they did not like to depart\r\n     from the precedent set in England, or until there was more\r\n     general practice among the States. The learned chief-justice,\r\n     perhaps, did not sufficiently reflect when he stated that there\r\n     were no English precedents. The fact is that Elizabeth herself\r\n     sat in the _Aula Regia_ and administered the law, and in both\r\n     Scotland and England women have fulfilled the function of judges.\r\n     The instances are not numerous but they are well established in\r\n     history. I myself have had my attention called to the fact that\r\n     in the various States the women are now admitted by special\r\n     legislation to the bar. I do not think there is anything in the\r\n     law, properly considered, that would debar a woman from coming\r\n     into this profession. I think the Supreme Court should not have\r\n     required further legislation, but it seems to have done so, and\r\n     that makes the necessity for the amendment which I have now\r\n     offered.\r\n\r\n     The chairman of the committee in reporting this bill back from\r\n     the Judiciary Committee said that the bill as it passed the House\r\n     of Representatives gave privileges to women which men did not\r\n     enjoy; that is to say, the Supreme Court can by a change of rule\r\n     require further qualification of men, whereas in regard to women,\r\n     if this provision were put into the statute, the Supreme Court\r\n     could not rule them out even though it may be necessary in its\r\n     judgment to get a higher standard of qualifications than its\r\n     present rules prescribe. Although I observe that my time is up, I\r\n     ask indulgence for a moment or two longer. As this is a question\r\n     of some interest and women cannot appear here to speak for\r\n     themselves, I hope I may be allowed to speak for them a moment.\r\n     Now, there is something in the objection stated by the chairman\r\n     of the Committee on the Judiciary--that is to say, the bill would\r\n     take the rule of the Supreme Court and put it in the statute and\r\n     apply it to women, thereby conferring exceptional privileges; but\r\n     that is not my intention at all, and therefore I have proposed\r\n     that women shall not be excluded from practicing law, if they are\r\n     otherwise qualified, on account of sex, and that is the provision\r\n     which I want to send back to the Judiciary Committee.\r\n\r\n     Mr. GARLAND: I wish to ask one question of the senator from\r\n     California. Suppose the court should exclude women, but not on\r\n     account of sex, then what is their remedy?\r\n\r\n     Mr. SARGENT: I do not see any pretense that the court could\r\n     exclude them on except on account of sex.\r\n\r\n     Mr. GARLAND: If I recollect the rule of the Supreme Court in\r\n     regard to the admission of practitioners (and I had to appear\r\n     there twice to present my claim before I could carry on my\r\n     profession in that court), I do not think any legislation is\r\n     necessary to aid them by giving them any more access to that\r\n     court than they have at present under the rules of the Supreme\r\n     Court.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SARGENT: I believe if the laws now existing were properly\r\n     construed (of course I speak with all deference to the Supreme\r\n     Court, but I express the opinion) they would be admitted, but\r\n     unfortunately the court does not take that view of it, and it\r\n     will wait for legislation. I purpose that the legislation shall\r\n     follow. If there is anything in principle why this privilege\r\n     should not be granted to women who are otherwise qualified, then\r\n     let the bill be defeated on that ground; but I say there is no\r\n     difference in principle whatever, not the slightest. There is no\r\n     reason because a citizen of the United States is a woman that she\r\n     should be deprived of her rights as a citizen, and these are\r\n     rights of a citizen. She has the same right to life, liberty and\r\n     the pursuit of happiness and employment, commensurate with her\r\n     capacities, as a man has; and, as to the question of capacity,\r\n     the history of the world shows from Queen Elizabeth and Queen\r\n     Isabella down to Madame Dudevant and Mrs. Stowe, that capacity is\r\n     not a question of sex.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MCDONALD: I have simply to say, Mr. President, that a number\r\n     of States and territories have authorized the admission of women\r\n     to the legal profession, and they have become members of the bar\r\n     of the highest courts of judicature. It may very frequently\r\n     occur, and has in some instances I believe really occurred, that\r\n     cases in which they have been thus employed have been brought to\r\n     the Supreme Court of the United States. To have the door closed\r\n     against them when the cause is brought here, not by them, or when\r\n     in the prosecution of the suits of their clients they find it\r\n     necessary to come here, seems to me entirely unjust. I therefore\r\n     favor the bill with the amendment. The proposed amendment is\r\n     perhaps better because it does away with any tendency to\r\n     discrimination in regard to the admissibility of women to\r\n     practice in the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDING OFFICER: The senator from California moves that the\r\n     bill be recommitted to the Committee on Judiciary.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SARGENT: I have the promise of the chairman of the committee\r\n     that the bill will soon be reported back, and therefore I am\r\n     willing that it go to the committee, and I make the motion that\r\n     it be recommitted. [The motion was agreed to.]\r\n\r\n     Mr. SARGENT: I ask that the amendment which I propose be printed.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDING OFFICER: The order to print will be made.\r\n\r\nMary Clemmer, the gifted correspondent of the New York\r\n_Independent_, learning that Senator Wadleigh was about to report\r\nadversely upon the sixteenth amendment, wrote the following private\r\nletter, which, as a record of her own sentiments on the question,\r\nshe gave to Miss Anthony for publication in this history:\r\n\r\n     Hon. BAINBRIDGE WADLEIGH--_Dear Sir_: The more I think of it the\r\n     more I regret that, as chairman of the Committee on Privileges\r\n     and Elections, you regard with less favor the enfranchisement of\r\n     women than did your distinguished predecessor, Senator Morton. At\r\n     this moment, when your committee is discussing that subject, I\r\n     sigh for the large outlook, the just mind, the unselfish decision\r\n     of that great legislator. You were his friend, you respected his\r\n     intellect, you believed in his integrity, you sit in his seat.\r\n     You are to prepare the report that he would prepare were he still\r\n     upon the earth. May I ask you to bring to that labor as fair a\r\n     spirit, as unprejudiced an outlook, as just a decision as he\r\n     would have done?\r\n\r\n     I ask this not as a partisan of woman's rights, but as a lover of\r\n     the human race. In this faint dawn of woman's day, I discern not\r\n     woman's development of freedom merely, but the promise of that\r\n     higher, finer, purer civilization which is to redeem the world,\r\n     the lack of which makes men tyrants and women slaves. You cannot\r\n     be unconscious of the fact that a new race of women is born into\r\n     the world, who, while they lack no womanly attribute, are the\r\n     peers of any man in intellect and aspiration. It will be\r\n     impossible long to deny to such women that equality before the\r\n     law granted to the lowest creature that crawls, if he happens to\r\n     be a man; denied to the highest creature that asks it, if she\r\n     happens to be a woman.\r\n\r\n     On what authority, save that of the gross regality of physical\r\n     strength, do you deny to a thoughtful, educated, tax-paying\r\n     person the common rights of citizenship because she is a woman? I\r\n     am a property-owner, the head of a household. By what right do\r\n     you assume to define and curtail for me my prerogatives as a\r\n     citizen, while as a tax-payer you make not the slightest\r\n     distinction between me and a man? Leave to my own perception what\r\n     is proper for me as a lady, to my own discretion what is wise for\r\n     me as a woman, to my own conscience what is my duty to my race\r\n     and to my God. Leave to unerring nature to protect the subtle\r\n     boundaries which define the distinctive life and action of the\r\n     sexes, while you as a legislator do everything in your power to\r\n     secure to every creature of God an equal chance to make the best\r\n     and most of himself.\r\n\r\n     If American men could say as Huxley says, \"I scorn to lay a\r\n     single obstacle in the way of those whom nature from the\r\n     beginning has so heavily burdened,\" the sexes would cease to war,\r\n     men and women would reign together, the equal companions,\r\n     friends, helpers, and lovers that nature intended they should be.\r\n     But what is love, tenderness, protection, even, unless rooted in\r\n     justice? Tyranny and servitude, that is all. Brute supremacy,\r\n     spiritual slavery. By what authority do you say that the country\r\n     is not prepared for a more enlightened franchise, for political\r\n     equality, if six women citizens, earnest, eloquent,\r\n     long-suffering, come to you and demand both? No words can express\r\n     my regret if to the minority report I see appended only the\r\n     honored name of George F. Hoar of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n                              Your friend,            MARY CLEMMER.\r\n\r\nIn response to all these arguments, appeals and petitions, Senator\r\nWadleigh, from the Committee on Privileges and Elections, presented\r\nthe following adverse report, June 14, 1878:\r\n\r\n     _The Committee on Privileges and Elections, to whom was referred\r\n     the Resolution (S. Res. 12) proposing an Amendment to the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, and certain Petitions for and\r\n     Remonstrances against the same, make the following Report:_\r\n\r\n     This proposed amendment forbids the United States, or any State\r\n     to deny or abridge the right to vote on account of sex. If\r\n     adopted, it will make several millions of female voters, totally\r\n     inexperienced in political affairs, quite generally dependent\r\n     upon the other sex, all incapable of performing military duty and\r\n     without the power to enforce the laws which their numerical\r\n     strength may enable them to make, and comparatively very few of\r\n     whom wish to assume the irksome and responsible political duties\r\n     which this measure thrusts upon them. An experiment so novel, a\r\n     change so great, should only be made slowly and in response to a\r\n     general public demand, of the existence of which there is no\r\n     evidence before your committee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marilla M. Ricker]\r\n\r\n     Petitions from various parts of the country, containing by\r\n     estimate about 30,000 names, have been presented to congress\r\n     asking for this legislation. They were procured through the\r\n     efforts of woman suffrage societies, thoroughly organized, with\r\n     active and zealous managers. The ease with which signatures may\r\n     be procured to any petition is well known. The small number of\r\n     petitioners, when compared with that of the intelligent women in\r\n     the country, is striking evidence that there exists among them no\r\n     general desire to take up the heavy burden of governing, which so\r\n     many men seek to evade. It would be unjust, unwise and impolitic\r\n     to impose that burden on the great mass of women throughout the\r\n     country who do not wish for it, to gratify the comparatively few\r\n     who do.\r\n\r\n     It has been strongly urged that without the right of suffrage,\r\n     women are, and will be, subjected to great oppression and\r\n     injustice.\r\n\r\n     But every one who has examined the subject at all knows that,\r\n     without female suffrage, legislation for years has improved and\r\n     is still improving the condition of woman. The disabilities\r\n     imposed upon her by the common law have, one by one, been swept\r\n     away, until in most of the States she has the full right to her\r\n     property and all, or nearly all, the rights which can be granted\r\n     without impairing or destroying the marriage relation. These\r\n     changes have been wrought by the spirit of the age, and are not,\r\n     generally at least, the result of any agitation by women in their\r\n     own behalf.\r\n\r\n     Nor can women justly complain of any partiality in the\r\n     administration of justice. They have the sympathy of judges and\r\n     particularly of juries to an extent which would warrant loud\r\n     complaint on the part of their adversaries of the sterner sex.\r\n     Their appeals to legislatures against injustice are never\r\n     unheeded, and there is no doubt that when any considerable part\r\n     of the women of any State really wish for the right to vote, it\r\n     will be granted without the intervention of congress.\r\n\r\n     Any State may grant the right of suffrage to women. Some of them\r\n     have done so to a limited extent, and perhaps with good results.\r\n     It is evident that in some States public opinion is much more\r\n     strongly in favor of it than it is in others. Your committee\r\n     regard it as unwise and inexpedient to enable three-fourths in\r\n     number of the States, through an amendment to the national\r\n     constitution, to force woman suffrage upon the other fourth in\r\n     which the public opinion of both sexes may be strongly adverse to\r\n     such a change.\r\n\r\n     For these reasons, your committee report back said resolution\r\n     with a recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed.\r\n\r\nThis adverse report was all the more disappointing because Mr.\r\nWadleigh, as Mrs. Clemmer's letter states, filled the place of Hon.\r\nOliver P. Morton of Indiana, one of the most steadfast friends of\r\nwoman suffrage, who, at the last session of congress, had asked as\r\na special favor the reference of our petitions to the Committee on\r\nPrivileges and Elections, of which he was chairman, that they might\r\nreceive proper attention and that he might report favorably upon\r\nthem. In the discussion on the Pembina bill in 1874, Senator\r\nMorton made an earnest speech in favor of woman's enfranchisement.\r\nIn his premature death our cause lost one of its bravest champions.\r\n\r\nSenator Wadleigh's report called forth severe criticism; notably\r\nfrom the _New Northwest_ of Oregon, the _Woman's Journal_ of\r\nBoston, the _Inter-Ocean_ of Chicago, the _Evening Telegram_ and\r\nthe _National Citizen_ of New York. We quote from the latter:\r\n\r\n     The report is not a statesman-like answer based upon fundamental\r\n     principles, but a mere politician's dodge--a species of\r\n     dust-throwing quite in vogue in Washington. \"Several millions of\r\n     voters totally inexperienced in political affairs\"! They would\r\n     have about as much experience as the fathers in 1776, as the\r\n     negroes in 1870, as the Irish, English, Italians, Norwegians,\r\n     Danes, French, Germans, Portuguese, Scotch, Russians, Turks,\r\n     Mexicans, Hungarians, Swedes and Indians, who form a good part of\r\n     the voting population of this country. Did Mr. Wadleigh never\r\n     hear of Agnes C. Jencks--the woman who has stirred up politics to\r\n     its deepest depth; who has shaken the seat of President Hayes;\r\n     who has set in motion the whole machinery of government, and who,\r\n     when brought to the witness stand has for hours successfully\r\n     baffled such wily politicians as Ben Butler and McMahon;--a woman\r\n     who thwarts alike Republican and Democrat, and at her own will\r\n     puts the brakes on all this turmoil of her own raising? Does\r\n     Senator Wadleigh know nothing of that woman's \"experience in\r\n     politics\"?\r\n\r\n     \"Quite dependent upon the other sex.\" It used to be said the\r\n     negroes were \"quite dependent\" upon their masters, that it would\r\n     really be an abuse of the poor things to set them free, but when\r\n     free and controlling the results of their own labor, it was found\r\n     the masters had been the ones \"quite dependent,\" and thousands of\r\n     them who before the war rolled in luxury, have since been in the\r\n     depths of poverty--some of them even dependent upon the bounty of\r\n     their former slaves. When men cease to rob women of their\r\n     earnings they will find them generally, as thousands now are,\r\n     capable of self-care.[36]\r\n\r\n     \"Military duty.\" When women hold the ballot there will not be\r\n     quite as much military duty to be done. They will then have a\r\n     voice and a vote in the matter, and the men will no longer be\r\n     able to throw the country into a war to gratify spite or\r\n     ambition, tearing from woman's arms her nearest and dearest. All\r\n     men do not like \"military duty.\" \"The key to that horrible\r\n     enigma, German socialism, is antagonism to the military system,\"\r\n     and nations are shaken with fear because of it. But when there is\r\n     necessity for military duty, women will be found in line. The\r\n     person who planned the Tennessee campaign, in which the Northern\r\n     armies secured their first victories, was a woman, Anna Ella\r\n     Carroll. Gen. Grant acted upon her plan, and was successful. She\r\n     was endorsed by President Lincoln, Seward, Stanton, Wade, Scott,\r\n     and all the nation's leaders in its hour of peril, and yet\r\n     congress has not granted her the pension which for ten years her\r\n     friends have demanded. Mr. Wadleigh holds his seat in the United\r\n     States Senate to-day, because of the \"military duty\" done by this\r\n     woman.\r\n\r\n     \"About 30,000 names,\" to petitions. There have been 70,000 sent\r\n     in during the present session of congress, for a sixteenth\r\n     amendment, besides hundreds of individual petitions from women\r\n     asking for the removal of their own political disabilities. Men\r\n     in this country are occasionally disfranchised for crime, and\r\n     sometimes pray for the removal of their political disabilities.\r\n     Nine such disfranchised men had the right of voting restored to\r\n     them during the last session of congress. But not a single one of\r\n     the five hundred women who individually asked to have their\r\n     political disabilities removed, was even so much as noticed by an\r\n     adverse report, Mr. Wadleigh knows it would make no difference if\r\n     300,000 women petitioned. But whether women ask for the ballot or\r\n     not has nothing to do with the question. Self-government is the\r\n     natural right of every individual, and because woman possesses\r\n     this natural right, she should be secured in its exercise.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Wadleigh says, \"nor can woman justly complain of any\r\n     partiality in the administration of justice.\" Let us examine: A\r\n     few years ago a married man in Washington, in official position,\r\n     forced a confession from his wife at the mouth of a pistol, and\r\n     shot his rival dead. Upon trial he was triumphantly acquitted and\r\n     afterwards sent abroad as foreign minister. A few months ago a\r\n     married woman in Georgia, who had been taunted by her rival with\r\n     boasts of having gained her husband's love, found this rival\r\n     dancing with him. She drew a knife and killed the woman on the\r\n     spot. She was tried, convicted, and, although nursing one infant,\r\n     and again about to become a mother, was sentenced to be hanged by\r\n     the neck till she was 'dead, dead, dead.' There is Mr. Wadleigh's\r\n     equal administration of justice between man and woman! There is\r\n     \"the sympathy of judges and juries.\" There is the \"extent which\r\n     would warrant loud complaint on the part of their adversaries of\r\n     the sterner sex.\" And this woman escaped the gallows not because\r\n     of \"the sympathy of the judge\" or \"jury,\" but because her own sex\r\n     took the matter up, and from every part of the country sent\r\n     petitions by the hundreds to Governor Colquitt of Georgia, asking\r\n     her pardon. That pardon came in the shape of ten years'\r\n     imprisonment;--ten years in a cell for a woman, the mother of a\r\n     nursing and an unborn infant, while for General Sickles the\r\n     mission to Madrid with high honors and a fat salary.\r\n\r\n     Messrs. Wadleigh of New Hampshire, McMillan of Minnesota, Ingalls\r\n     of Kansas, Saulsbury of Delaware, Merrimon of North Carolina and\r\n     Hill of Georgia, all senators of the United States, are the\r\n     committee that report it \"inexpedient\" to secure equal rights to\r\n     the women of the United States. But we are not discouraged; we\r\n     are not disheartened; all the Wadleighs in the Senate, all the\r\n     committees of both Houses, the whole congress of the United\r\n     States against us, would not lessen our faith, nor our efforts.\r\n     We know we are right; we know we shall be successful; we know the\r\n     day is not far distant, when this government and the world will\r\n     acknowledge the exact and permanent political equality of man and\r\n     woman, and we know that until that hour comes woman will be\r\n     oppressed, degraded; a slave, without a single right that man\r\n     feels himself bound to respect. Work then, women, for your own\r\n     freedom. Let the early morning see you busy, and dusky evening\r\n     find you planning how you may become FREE.\r\n\r\nBut the most severe judgment upon Mr. Wadleigh's action came from\r\nhis own constituents, who, at the close of the forty-fifth congress\r\nexcused his further presence in the United States Senate, sending\r\nin his stead the Hon. Henry W. Blair, a valiant champion of\r\nnational protection for national citizens.[37]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1878, Mrs. Williams transferred the _Ballot-Box_ to Mrs.\r\nGage, who removed it to Syracuse, New York, and changed its name to\r\nthe _National Citizen_. In her prospectus Mrs. Gage said:\r\n\r\n     The _National Citizen_ will advocate the principle that suffrage\r\n     is the citizen's right, and should be protected by national law,\r\n     and that, while States may regulate the suffrage, they should\r\n     have no power to abolish it. Its especial object will be to\r\n     secure national protection to women in the exercise of their\r\n     right to vote; it will oppose class legislation of whatever form.\r\n     It will support no political party until one arises which is\r\n     based upon the exact equality of man and woman.\r\n\r\n     As the first step towards becoming well is to know you are ill,\r\n     one of the principal aims of the _National Citizen_ will be to\r\n     make those women discontented who are now content; to waken them\r\n     to self-respect and a desire to use the talents they possess; to\r\n     educate their consciences aright; to quicken their sense of duty;\r\n     to destroy morbid beliefs, and fit them for their high\r\n     responsibilities as citizens of a republic. The _National\r\n     Citizen_ has no faith in that old theory that \"a woman once lost\r\n     is lost forever,\" neither does it believe in the assertion that\r\n     \"a woman who sins, sinks to depths of wickedness lower than man\r\n     can reach.\" On the contrary it believes there is a future for the\r\n     most abandoned, if only the kindly hand of love and sympathy be\r\n     extended to rescue them from the degradation into which they have\r\n     fallen. The _National Citizen_ will endeavor to keep its readers\r\n     informed of the progress of women in foreign countries, and will,\r\n     as far as possible, revolutionize this country, striving to make\r\n     it live up to its own fundamental principles and become in\r\n     reality what it is but in name--a genuine republic.\r\n\r\nInstead of holding its usual May anniversary in New York city, the\r\nNational Association decided to meet in Rochester to celebrate the\r\nclose of the third decade of organized agitation in the United\r\nStates, and issued the following call:\r\n\r\n     The National Association will hold a convention in Rochester, N.\r\n     Y., July 19, 1878. This will be the thirtieth anniversary of the\r\n     first woman's rights convention, held July 19, 1848, in the\r\n     Wesleyan church at Seneca Falls, N. Y., and adjourned to meet,\r\n     August 2, in Rochester. Some who took part in that convention\r\n     have passed away, but many others, including both Mrs. Mott and\r\n     Mrs. Stanton, are still living. This convention will take the\r\n     place of the usual May anniversary, and will be largely devoted\r\n     to reminiscences. Friends are cordially invited to be present.\r\n\r\n                               CLEMENCE S. LOZIER, M. D., _President_.\r\n\r\n    SUSAN B. ANTHONY, _Chairman Executive Committee_.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was held in the Unitarian church on Fitzhugh street,\r\noccupied by the same society that had opened its doors in 1848; and\r\nAmy Post, one of the leading spirits of the first convention, still\r\nliving in Rochester and in her seventy-seventh year, assisted in\r\nthe arrangements. Rochester, known as \"The Flower City,\"\r\ncontributed of its beauty to the adornment of the church. It was\r\ncrowded at the first session. Representatives from a large number\r\nof States were present,[38] and there was a pleasant interchange of\r\ngreetings between those whose homes were far apart, but who were\r\nfriends and co-workers in this great reform. The reunion was more\r\nlike the meeting of near and dear relatives than of strangers whose\r\nonly bond was work in a common cause. Such are the compensations\r\nwhich help to sustain reformers while they battle ignorance and\r\nprejudice in order to secure justice. In the absence of the\r\npresident, Dr. Clemence S. Lozier, Mrs. Stanton took the chair and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     We are here to celebrate the third decade of woman's struggle in\r\n     this country for liberty. Thirty years have passed since many of\r\n     us now present met in this place to discuss the true position of\r\n     woman as a citizen of a republic. The reports of our first\r\n     conventions show that those who inaugurated this movement\r\n     understood the significance of the term \"citizens.\" At the very\r\n     start we claimed full equality with man. Our meetings were\r\n     hastily called and somewhat crudely conducted; but we intuitively\r\n     recognized the fact that we were defrauded of our natural rights,\r\n     conceded in the national constitution. And thus the greatest\r\n     movement of the century was inaugurated. I say greatest, because\r\n     through the elevation of woman all humanity is lifted to a higher\r\n     plane. To contrast our position thirty years ago, under the old\r\n     common law of England, with that we occupy under the advanced\r\n     legislation of to-day, is enough to assure us that we have passed\r\n     the boundary line--from slavery to freedom. We already see the\r\n     mile-stones of a new civilization on every highway.\r\n\r\n     Look at the department of education, the doors of many colleges\r\n     and universities thrown wide open to women; girls contending for,\r\n     yea, and winning prizes over their brothers. In the working world\r\n     they are rapidly filling places and climbing heights unknown to\r\n     them before, realizing, in fact, the dreams, the hopes, the\r\n     prophesies of the inspired women of by-gone centuries. In many\r\n     departments of learning woman stands the peer of man, and when by\r\n     higher education and profitable labor she becomes self-reliant\r\n     and independent, then she must and will be free. The moment an\r\n     individual or a class is strong enough to stand alone, bondage is\r\n     impossible. Jefferson Davis, in a recent speech, says: \"A Caesar\r\n     could not subject a people fit to be free, nor could a Brutus\r\n     save them if they were fit for subjugation.\"\r\n\r\n     Looking back over the past thirty years, how long ago seems that\r\n     July morning when we gathered round the altar in the old Wesleyan\r\n     church in Seneca Falls! It taxes and wearies the memory to think\r\n     of all the conventions we have held, the legislatures we have\r\n     besieged, the petitions and tracts we have circulated, the\r\n     speeches, the calls, the resolutions we have penned, the\r\n     never-ending debates we have kept up in public and private, and\r\n     yet to each and all our theme is as fresh and absorbing as it was\r\n     the day we started. Calm, benignant, subdued as we look on this\r\n     platform, if any man should dare to rise in our presence and\r\n     controvert a single position we have taken, there is not a woman\r\n     here that would not in an instant, with flushed face and flashing\r\n     eye, bristle all over with sharp, pointed arguments that would\r\n     soon annihilate the most skilled logician, the most profound\r\n     philosopher.\r\n\r\n     To those of you on this platform who for these thirty years have\r\n     been the steadfast representatives of woman's cause, my friends\r\n     and co-laborers, let me say our work has not been in vain. True,\r\n     we have not yet secured the suffrage, but we have aroused public\r\n     thought to the many disabilities of our sex, and our countrywomen\r\n     to higher self-respect and worthier ambition, and in this\r\n     struggle for justice we have deepened and broadened our own lives\r\n     and extended the horizon of our vision. Ridiculed, persecuted,\r\n     ostracised, we have learned to place a just estimate on popular\r\n     opinion, and to feel a just confidence in ourselves. As the\r\n     representatives of principles which it was necessary to explain\r\n     and defend, we have been compelled to study constitutions and\r\n     laws, and in thus seeking to redress the wrongs and vindicate the\r\n     rights of the many, we have secured a higher development for\r\n     ourselves. Nor is this all. The full fruition of these years of\r\n     seed-sowing shall yet be realized, though it may not be by those\r\n     who have led in the reform, for many of our number have already\r\n     fallen asleep. Another decade and not one of us may be here, but\r\n     we have smoothed the rough paths for those who come after us. The\r\n     lives of multitudes will be gladdened by the sacrifices we have\r\n     made, and the truths we have uttered can never die.\r\n\r\n     Standing near the gateway of the unknown land and looking back\r\n     through the vista of the past, memory recalls many duties in\r\n     life's varied relations we would had been better done. The past\r\n     to all of us is filled with regrets. We can recall, perchance,\r\n     social ambitions disappointed, fond hopes wrecked, ideals in\r\n     wealth, power, position, unattained--much that would be\r\n     considered success in life unrealized. But I think we should all\r\n     agree that the time, the thought, the energy we have devoted to\r\n     the freedom of our countrywomen, that the past, in so far as our\r\n     lives have represented this great movement, brings us only\r\n     unalloyed satisfaction. The rights already obtained, the full\r\n     promise of the rising generation of women more than repay us for\r\n     the hopes so long deferred, the rights yet denied, the\r\n     humiliation of spirit we still suffer.\r\n\r\n     And for those of you who have been mere spectators of the long,\r\n     hard battle we have fought, and are still fighting, I have a\r\n     word. Whatever your attitude has been, whether as cold,\r\n     indifferent observers--whether you have hurled at us the shafts\r\n     of ridicule or of denunciation, we ask you now to lay aside your\r\n     old educational prejudices and give this question your earnest\r\n     consideration, substituting reason for ridicule, sympathy for\r\n     sneers. I urge the young women especially to prepare themselves\r\n     to take up the work so soon to fall from our hands. You have had\r\n     opportunities for education such as we had not. You hold to-day\r\n     the vantage-ground we have won by argument. Show now your\r\n     gratitude to us by making the uttermost of yourselves, and by\r\n     your earnest, exalted lives secure to those who come after you a\r\n     higher outlook, a broader culture, a larger freedom than have yet\r\n     been vouchsafed to woman in our own happy land.\r\n\r\nCongratulatory letters[39] and telegrams were received from all\r\nportions of the United States and from the old world. Space admits\r\nthe publication of but a few, yet all breathed the same hopeful\r\nspirit and confidence in future success. Abigail Bush, who presided\r\nover the first Rochester convention, said:\r\n\r\n     No one knows what I passed through upon that occasion. I was born\r\n     and baptized in the old Scotch Presbyterian church. At that time\r\n     its sacred teachings were, \"if a woman would know anything let\r\n     her ask her husband at home.\" * * * I well remember the incidents\r\n     of that meeting and the thoughts awakened by it. * * * Say to\r\n     your convention my full heart is with them in all their\r\n     deliberations and counsels, and I trust great good to women will\r\n     come of their efforts.\r\n\r\nErnestine L. Rose, a native of Poland, and, next to Frances Wright,\r\nthe earliest advocate of woman's enfranchisement in America, wrote\r\nfrom England:\r\n\r\n     How I should like to be with you at the anniversary--it reminds\r\n     me of the delightful convention we had at Rochester, long, long\r\n     ago--and speak of the wonderful change that has taken place in\r\n     regard to woman. Compare her present position in society with the\r\n     one she occupied _forty_ years ago, when I undertook to\r\n     emancipate her from not only barbarous laws, but from what was\r\n     even worse, a barbarous public opinion. No one can appreciate the\r\n     wonderful change in the social and moral condition of woman,\r\n     except by looking back and comparing the past with the present. *\r\n     * * Say to the friends, Go on, go on, halt not and rest not.\r\n     Remember that \"eternal vigilance is the price of liberty\" and of\r\n     right. Much has been achieved; but the main, the vital thing, has\r\n     yet to come. The suffrage is the magic key to the statute--the\r\n     insignia of citizenship in a republic.\r\n\r\nCaroline Ashurst Biggs, editor of the _Englishwoman's Review_,\r\nLondon, wrote:\r\n\r\n     I have read with great interest in the _National Citizen_ and the\r\n     _Woman's Journal_ the announcement of the forthcoming convention\r\n     in Rochester. * * * I cannot refrain from sending you a cordial\r\n     English congratulation upon the great advance in the social and\r\n     legal position of women in America, which has been the result of\r\n     your labor. The next few years will see still greater progress.\r\n     As soon as the suffrage is granted to women, a concession which\r\n     will not be many years in coming either in England or America,\r\n     every one of our questions will advance with double force, and\r\n     meanwhile our efforts in that direction are simultaneously\r\n     helping forward other social, legal, educational and moral\r\n     reforms. Our organization in England does not date back so far as\r\n     yours. There were only a few isolated thinkers when Mrs. John\r\n     Stuart Mill wrote her essay on the enfranchisement of women in\r\n     1851. For twenty years, however, it has progressed with few\r\n     drawbacks. In some particulars the English laws in respect of\r\n     women are in advance of yours, but the connection between England\r\n     and America is so close that a gain to one is a gain to the\r\n     other.\r\n\r\nLydia E. Becker, editor of the _Women's Suffrage Journal_,\r\nManchester, England, wrote:\r\n\r\n     * * * I beg to offer to the venerable pioneers of the movement,\r\n     more especially to Lucretia Mott, a tribute of respectful\r\n     admiration and gratitude for the services they have rendered in\r\n     the cause of enfranchisement. * * * As regards the United\r\n     kingdom, the movement in a practical form is but twelve years\r\n     old, and in that period, although we have not obtained the\r\n     parliamentary franchise, we have seen it supported by at least\r\n     one-third of the House of Commons, and our claim admitted as one\r\n     which must be dealt with in future measures of parliamentary\r\n     reform. We have obtained the municipal franchise and the\r\n     school-board franchise. Women have secured the right to enter the\r\n     medical profession and to take degrees in the University of\r\n     London, besides considerable amendment of the law regarding\r\n     married women, though much remains to be done.\r\n\r\nSenator Sargent, since minister to Berlin, wrote:\r\n\r\n     I regret that the necessity to proceed at once to California will\r\n     deprive me of the pleasure of attending your convention of July\r\n     19, the anniversary of the spirited declaration of rights put\r\n     forth thirty years ago by some of the noblest and most\r\n     enlightened women of America. Women's rights have made vast\r\n     strides since that day, in juster legislation, in widened spheres\r\n     of employment, and in the gradual but certain recognition by\r\n     large numbers of citizens of the justice and policy of extending\r\n     the elective franchise to women. It is now very generally\r\n     conceded that the time is rapidly approaching when women will\r\n     vote. The friends of the movement have faith in the result; its\r\n     enemies grudgingly admit it. Courage and work will hasten the\r\n     day. The worst difficulties have already been overcome. The\r\n     movement has passed the stage of ridicule, and even that of\r\n     abuse, and has entered that of intelligent discussion, its worst\r\n     adversaries treating it with respect. You are so familiar with\r\n     all the arguments in favor of this great reform that I will not\r\n     attempt to state them; but I wish to say that as an observer of\r\n     public events, it is my deliberate judgment that your triumph is\r\n     near at hand. There are vastly more men and women in the United\r\n     States now who believe that women should have the right to vote\r\n     than there were in 1848 who believed the slave should be freed.\r\n     This is a government of opinions and the growing opinion will be\r\n     irresistible.\r\n\r\n                              Respectfully yours,      A. A. SARGENT.\r\n\r\nThe following letters from the great leaders of the anti-slavery\r\nmovement were gratefully received. As Mr. Garrison soon after\r\nfinished his eventful life, this proved to be his last message to\r\nour association:\r\n\r\n                                   BOSTON, June 30, 1878.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MISS ANTHONY--Your urgent and welcome letter, inviting me\r\n     to the thirtieth anniversary of the woman's rights movement at\r\n     Rochester, came yesterday. Most earnestly do I wish I could be\r\n     present to help mark this epoch in our movement, and join in\r\n     congratulating the friends on the marvelous results of their\r\n     labors. No reform has gathered more devoted and self-sacrificing\r\n     friends. No one has had lives more generously given to its\r\n     service; and you who have borne such heavy burdens may well\r\n     rejoice in the large harvest; for no reform has, I think, had\r\n     such rapid success. You who remember the indifference which\r\n     almost discouraged us in 1848, and who have so bravely faced\r\n     ungenerous opposition and insult since, must look back on the\r\n     result with unmixed astonishment and delight. Temperance, and\r\n     finance--which is but another name for the labor movement--and\r\n     woman's rights, are three radical questions which overtop all\r\n     others in value and importance. Woman's claim for the ballot-box\r\n     has had a much wider influence than merely to protect woman.\r\n     Universal suffrage is itself in danger. Scholars dread it; social\r\n     science and journalists attack it. The discussion of woman's\r\n     claim has done much to reveal this danger, and rally patriotic\r\n     and thoughtful men in defense. In many ways the agitation has\r\n     educated the people. Its success shows that the masses are sound\r\n     and healthy; and if we gain, in the coming fifteen years, half as\r\n     much as we have in the last thirty, woman will hold spear and\r\n     shield in her own hands. If I might presume to advise, I should\r\n     say close up the ranks and write on our flag only one claim--the\r\n     ballot. Everything helps us, and if we are united, success cannot\r\n     long be delayed.\r\n\r\n                                   Very cordially yours,\r\n                                             WENDELL PHILLIPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        BOSTON, July 16, 1878.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIEND--The thirtieth anniversary of the first woman's\r\n     rights convention ever held with special reference to demanding\r\n     the elective franchise irrespective of sex well deserves to be\r\n     commemorated in the manner set forth in the call for the same, at\r\n     Rochester, on the 19th instant. As a substitute for my personal\r\n     attendance, I can only send a brief but warm congratulatory\r\n     epistle on the cheering progress which the movement has made\r\n     within the period named. For how widely different are the\r\n     circumstances under which that convention was held, and those\r\n     which attend the celebration of its third decade! Then, the\r\n     assertion of civil and political equality, alike for men and\r\n     women, excited widespread disgust and astonishment, as though it\r\n     were a proposition to repeal the laws of nature, and literally to\r\n     \"turn the world upside down\"; and it was ridiculed and\r\n     caricatured as little short of lunacy. Now, it is a subject of\r\n     increasing interest and grave consideration, from the Atlantic to\r\n     the Pacific, and what at first appeared to be so foolish in\r\n     pretension is admitted by all reflecting and candid minds to be\r\n     deserving of the most respectful treatment. Then, its avowed\r\n     friends, were indeed \"few and far between,\" even among those\r\n     disfranchised as the penalty of their womanhood. Now, they can be\r\n     counted by tens of thousands, and their number is\r\n     augmenting--foremost in intelligence, in weight of character, in\r\n     strength of understanding, in manly and womanly development, and\r\n     in all that goes to make up enlightened citizenship. Then, with\r\n     rare exceptions, women were everywhere remanded to poverty and\r\n     servile dependence, being precluded from following those\r\n     avocations and engaging in those pursuits which make competency\r\n     and independence not a difficult achievement. Now, there is\r\n     scarcely any situation or profession, in the arrangements of\r\n     society, to which they may not and do not aspire, and in which\r\n     many of them are not usefully engaged; whether in new and varied\r\n     industrial employment, in the arts and sciences, in the highest\r\n     range of literature, in philosophic and mathematical\r\n     investigations, in the professions of law, medicine, and\r\n     divinity, in high scholarship, in educational training and\r\n     supervision, in rhetoric and oratory, in the lyceum, or in\r\n     discharging the official duties connected with the various\r\n     departments of the State and national governments.\r\n\r\n     Almost all barriers are down except that which prevents women\r\n     from going to the polls to help decide who shall be the\r\n     law-makers and what shall be the laws, so that the general\r\n     welfare may be impartially consulted, and the blessings of\r\n     freedom and equal rights be enjoyed by all. That barrier, too,\r\n     must give way wherever erected, as sure as time outlasts and\r\n     baffles every device of wrong-doing, and truth is stronger than\r\n     falsehood, and the law of eternal justice is as reliable as the\r\n     law of gravitation. Yes! the grand fundamental truths of the\r\n     Declaration of Independence shall yet be reduced to practice in\r\n     our land--that the human race are created free and equal; that\r\n     government derives its just powers from the consent of the\r\n     governed, and that taxation without representation is tyranny.\r\n     And I confidently predict that this will be witnessed before the\r\n     expiration of another decade.\r\n\r\n                         Yours, to abate nothing of heart or hope,\r\n                                               WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mott never seemed more hopeful for the triumph of our\r\nprinciples than on this occasion. She expressed great satisfaction\r\nin the number of young women who for the first time that day graced\r\nour platform.[40] Though in her eighty-sixth year, her enthusiasm\r\nin the cause for which she had so long labored seemed still\r\nunabated, and her eye sparkled with humor as of yore while giving\r\nsome amusing reminiscences of encounters with opponents in the\r\nearly days. Always apt in biblical quotations she had proved\r\nherself a worthy antagonist of the clergy on our platform. She had\r\nslain many Abimelechs with short texts of Scripture, whose defeat\r\nwas the more humiliating because received at the hand of a woman.\r\nAs she recounted in her happiest vein the triumphs of her\r\ncoadjutors she was received with the heartiest manifestations of\r\ndelight by her auditors. She took a lively interest in the\r\ndiscussion of the resolutions that had been presented by the\r\nchairman of the committee, Matilda Joslyn Gage:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That a government of the people, by the people and\r\n     for the people is yet to be realized; for that which is formed,\r\n     administered and controlled only by men, is practically nothing\r\n     more than an enlarged oligarchy, whose assumptions of natural\r\n     superiority and of the right to rule are as baseless as those\r\n     enforced by the aristocratic powers of the old world.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That in celebrating our third decade we have reason\r\n     to congratulate ourselves on the marked change in woman's\r\n     position--in her enlarged opportunities for education and labor,\r\n     her greater freedom under improved social customs and civil laws,\r\n     and the promise of her speedy enfranchisement in the minor\r\n     political rights she has already secured.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the International Congress[41] called in Paris,\r\n     July 20, to discuss the rights of woman--the eminent Victor Hugo,\r\n     its presiding officer--is one of the most encouraging events of\r\n     the century, in that statesmen and scholars from all parts of the\r\n     world, amid the excitement of the French Exposition, propose to\r\n     give five days to deliberations upon this question.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the majority report of the chairman of the\r\n     Committee on Privileges and Elections, Senator Wadleigh of New\r\n     Hampshire, against a sixteenth amendment to secure the political\r\n     rights of woman in its weakness, shows the strength of our\r\n     reform.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the national effort to force citizenship on the\r\n     Indians, the decision of Judge Sawyer in the United States\r\n     Circuit Court of California against the naturalization of the\r\n     Chinese, and the refusal of congress to secure the right of\r\n     suffrage to women, are class legislation, dangerous to the\r\n     stability of our institutions.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Woman's rights and duties in all matters of legislation\r\n     are the same as those of man.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the problems of labor, finance, suffrage,\r\n     international rights, internal improvements, and other great\r\n     questions, can never be satisfactorily adjusted without the\r\n     enlightened thought of woman, and her voice in the councils of\r\n     the nation.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the question of capital and labor is one of\r\n     special interest to us. Man, standing to woman in the position of\r\n     capitalist, has robbed her through the ages of the results of her\r\n     toil. No just settlement of this question can be attained until\r\n     the right of woman to the proceeds of her labor in the family and\r\n     elsewhere is recognized, and she is welcomed into every industry\r\n     on the basis of equal pay for equal work.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That as the first duty of every individual is\r\n     self-development, the lessons of self-sacrifice and obedience\r\n     taught woman by the Christian church have been fatal, not only to\r\n     her own vital interests, but through her, to those of the race.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the great principle of the Protestant\r\n     Reformation, the right of individual conscience and judgment\r\n     heretofore exercised by man alone, should now be claimed by\r\n     woman; that, in the interpretation of Scripture, she should be\r\n     guided by her own reason, and not by the authority of the church.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is through the perversion of the religious\r\n     element in woman--playing upon her hopes and fears of the future,\r\n     holding this life with all its high duties in abeyance to that\r\n     which is to come--that she and the children she has trained have\r\n     been so completely subjugated by priestcraft and superstition.\r\n\r\nThis was the last convention ever attended by Lucretia Mott. Her\r\nfamily had specially requested that she should not be urged to go;\r\nbut on seeing the call, she quietly announced her intention to be\r\nat the meeting, and, with the ever faithful Sarah Pugh as her\r\ncompanion, she made the journey from Philadelphia in the intense\r\nheat of those July days. Mrs. Mott was the guest of her husband's\r\nnephew, Dr. E.M. Moore, who, fearing that his aunt would be utterly\r\nexhausted, called for her while she was in the midst of her closing\r\nremarks. As she descended the platform, she continued speaking\r\nwhile she slowly moved down the aisle, shaking hands upon either\r\nside. The audience simultaneously rose, and on behalf of all,\r\nFrederick Douglass ejaculated, \"Good-by, dear Lucretia!\"\r\n\r\nThe last three resolutions called out a prolonged discussion[42]\r\nnot only in the convention but from the pulpit and press of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nOne amusing encounter in the course of the debate is worthy of\r\nnote. Perhaps it was due to the intense heat that Mr. Douglass,\r\nusually clear on questions of principle, was misled into opposing\r\nthe resolutions. He spoke with great feeling and religious\r\nsentiment of the beautiful Christian doctrine of self-sacrifice.\r\nWhen he finished, Mrs. Lucy Coleman, always keen in pricking\r\nbubbles, arose and said: \"Well, Mr. Douglass, all you say may be\r\ntrue; but allow me to ask you why you did not remain a slave in\r\nMaryland, and sacrifice yourself, like a Christian, to your master,\r\ninstead of running off to Canada to secure your liberty, like a\r\nman? We shall judge your faith, Frederick, by your deeds.\"\r\n\r\nAn immense audience assembled at Corinthian Hall in the evening to\r\nlisten to the closing speeches[43] of the convention. Mrs. Robinson\r\nof Boston gave an exhaustive review of the work in Massachusetts,\r\nand her daughter, Mrs. Shattuck, gave many amusing experiences as\r\nher father's[44] clerk in the legislature of that State.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions provoked many attacks from the clergy throughout\r\nthe State, led by Rev. A.H. Strong, D.D., president of the Baptist\r\nTheological Seminary in Rochester, Of his sermon the _National\r\nCitizen_ said:\r\n\r\n     None too soon have we issued our resolutions, proclaiming woman's\r\n     right to self-development--to interpret Scripture for herself, to\r\n     use her own faculties. In speaking of what Christianity has done\r\n     for woman, Dr. Strong stultifies his own assertions by referring\r\n     to Switzerland and Germany \"where you may see any day hundreds of\r\n     women wheeling earth for railroad embankments.\" Does he not\r\n     remember that Switzerland and Germany are Christian countries and\r\n     that it is part of their civilization that while women do this\r\n     work, some man takes the pay and puts it in his own pocket quite\r\n     in heathen fashion? The reverend doctor in the usual style of\r\n     opposition to woman--which is to quote something or other having\r\n     no bearing upon the question--refers to Cornelia's \"jewels,\"\r\n     forgetting to say that Cornelia delivered public lectures upon\r\n     philosophy in Rome, and that Cicero paid the very highest tribute\r\n     to her learning and genius.\r\n\r\n     Dr. Strong advocates the old theory that woman and man are not\r\n     two classes standing upon the same level, but that the two are\r\n     one--that one on the time-worn theory of common law, the husband;\r\n     and talks of the \"dignity and delicacy of woman\" being due to the\r\n     fact of her not having been in public life, and that this\r\n     \"dignity and delicacy\" would all evaporate if once she were\r\n     allowed to vote, which reminds one of the story of Baron\r\n     Munchausen's horn, into which a certain coach-driver blew all\r\n     manner of wicked tunes. The weather being very cold, these tunes\r\n     remained frozen in the horn. When hung by the fire, the horn\r\n     began to thaw out, and these wicked tunes came pealing forth to\r\n     the great amazement of the by-standers. The reverend gentlemen\r\n     seems to think women are full of frozen wickedness, which if they\r\n     enter public life will be thawed out to the utter demolition of\r\n     their \"dignity and delicacy\" and the disgust of society. He deems\r\n     it \"too hazardous\" to allow women to vote. \"Bad women would\r\n     vote.\" Well, what of it? Have they not equal right with bad men,\r\n     to self-government? Bad is a relative term. It strikes us that\r\n     the very reverend Dr. Strong is a \"bad\" man--a man who does not\r\n     understand true Christianity--who is not just--who would strike\r\n     those who are down--who would keep woman in slavery--who quotes\r\n     the Bible as his authority: thus fettering woman's conscience,\r\n     binding her will, and playing upon her hopes and fears to keep\r\n     her in subjection.\r\n\r\n     From Augustine, down, theologians have tried to compel people to\r\n     accept their special interpretation of the Scripture, and the\r\n     tortures of the inquisition, the rack, the thumb-screw, the\r\n     stake, the persecutions of witchcraft, the whipping of naked\r\n     women through the streets of Boston, banishment, trials for\r\n     heresy, the halter about Garrison's neck, Lovejoy's death, the\r\n     branding of Captain Walker, shouts of infidel and atheist, have\r\n     all been for this purpose.\r\n\r\n     We know the ignorance that exists upon these points. Few have yet\r\n     begun to comprehend the influence that ecclesiasticism has had\r\n     upon law. Wharton, a recognized authority upon criminal law,\r\n     issued his seventh edition before he ascertained the vast bearing\r\n     canon law had had upon the civil code, and we advise readers to\r\n     consult the array of authorities, English, Latin, German, to\r\n     which he, in his preface, refers. We hope to arouse attention\r\n     and compel investigation of this subject by lawyers and\r\n     theologians as well as by women themselves.\r\n\r\nFrancis E. Abbot, editor of _The Index_, the organ of the Free\r\nReligious Association, spoke grandly in favor of the resolutions.\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n     These resolutions we have read with astonishment, admiration and\r\n     delight. We should not have believed it possible that the\r\n     convention could have been induced to adopt them. They will make\r\n     forever memorable in the history of the organized woman movement,\r\n     this thirtieth anniversary of its birth. They put the National\r\n     Woman Suffrage Association in an inconceivably higher and nobler\r\n     position than that occupied by any similar society. They go to\r\n     the very root of the matter. They are a bold, dignified, and\r\n     magnificent utterance. We congratulate the convention on a record\r\n     so splendid in the eyes of all true liberals. From this day forth\r\n     the whole woman movement must obey the inspiration of a higher\r\n     courage and a grander spirit than have been known to its past.\r\n     Opposition must be encountered, tenfold more bitter than was ever\r\n     yet experienced. But truth is on the side of these brave women;\r\n     the ringing words they have spoken at Rochester will thrill many\r\n     a doubting heart and be echoed far down the long avenue of the\r\n     years.\r\n\r\nDuring the same week of the Rochester convention, the Paris\r\nInternational Congress opened it sessions, sending us a telegram of\r\ngreeting to which we responded with two hundred and fifty francs as\r\na tangible evidence of our best wishes. The two remarkable features\r\nof that congress were the promise of so distinguished a man as\r\nVictor Hugo to preside over its deliberations, though at last\r\nprevented by illness; and the fact that the Italian government sent\r\nMlle. Mozzoni as an official delegate to the congress to study the\r\ncivil position of woman in various countries, in order that an\r\nameliorating change of its code, in respect to woman, could be\r\nwisely made.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers of the French capital in general treated the\r\ncongress with respect. The _Rappel_, Victor Hugo's organ, spoke of\r\nit in a most complimentary manner. Theodore Stanton, in a letter to\r\nthe _National Citizen_, said:\r\n\r\n     In one important respect this congress differed entirely from an\r\n     American convention of like character--it made no demand for\r\n     suffrage. The word was never mentioned except by the American\r\n     delegates. In continental Europe the idea of demanding for woman\r\n     a share in the government, is never considered. This is the more\r\n     remarkable in France, as this claim was made at the time of the\r\n     revolution. But every imaginable side of the question was\r\n     discussed, except the side that comprehends all the others. To an\r\n     American, therefore, European woman's rights is rather tame; it\r\n     is like the play of Hamlet with Hamlet left out. But Europe is\r\n     moving, and the next international congress will, undoubtedly,\r\n     give more attention to suffrage and less to hygiene.\r\n\r\nThe Eleventh Washington Convention was held January 9, 10, 1879.\r\nThe resolutions give an idea of the status of the question, and the\r\nwide range of discussion covered by the speakers:[45]\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the forty-fifth congress, in ignoring the\r\n     individual petitions of more than three hundred women of high\r\n     social standing and culture, asking for the removal of their\r\n     political disabilities, while promptly enacting special\r\n     legislation for the removal of the political disabilities of\r\n     every man who petitioned, furnishes an illustration of the\r\n     indifference of this congress to the rights of citizens deprived\r\n     of political power.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Senator Blaine says, it is the very essence of tyranny\r\n     to count any citizens in the basis of representation who are\r\n     denied a voice in their laws and a choice in their rulers;\r\n     therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That counting women in the basis of representation,\r\n     while denying them the right of suffrage, is compelling them to\r\n     swell the number of their tyrants and is an unwarrantable\r\n     usurpation of power over one-half the citizens of this republic.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, In President Hayes' last message, he makes a truly\r\n     paternal review of the interests of this republic, both great and\r\n     small, from the army, the navy, and our foreign relations, to the\r\n     ten little Indians in Hampton, Va., our timber on the western\r\n     mountains, and the switches of the Washington railroads; from the\r\n     Paris Exposition, the postal service, the abundant harvests, and\r\n     the possible bull-dozing of some colored men in various southern\r\n     districts, to cruelty to live animals, and the crowded condition\r\n     of the mummies, dead ducks and fishes in the Smithsonian\r\n     Institute--yet forgets to mention twenty million women robbed of\r\n     their social, civil and political rights; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That a committee of three be appointed from this\r\n     convention to wait upon the president and remind him of the\r\n     existence of one-half of the American people whom he has\r\n     accidentally overlooked, and of whom it would be wise for him to\r\n     make some mention in his future messages.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, All of the vital principles involved in the thirteenth,\r\n     fourteenth and fifteenth constitutional amendments have been\r\n     denied in their application to women by courts, legislatures and\r\n     political parties; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is logical that these amendments should fail\r\n     to protect even the male African for whom said courts,\r\n     legislatures and parties declare they were expressly designed and\r\n     enacted.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the judges of the Supreme Court of the United\r\n     States in denying Belva A. Lockwood admission to its bar, while\r\n     she was entitled under the law and under its rules to that right,\r\n     violated their oath of office.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Edmonds\r\n     chairman, in its report on the bill to allow women to practice\r\n     law in the courts of the United States in which it declares that\r\n     \"further legislation is not necessary,\" evaded the plain question\r\n     at issue before it in a manner unworthy of judges learned in the\r\n     honorable profession of the law, and thereby sanctioned an\r\n     injustice to the women of the whole country.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The general government has refused to exercise federal\r\n     power to protect women in their right to vote in the various\r\n     States and territories; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it should forbear to exercise federal power to\r\n     disfranchise the women of Utah, who have had a more just and\r\n     liberal spirit shown them by Mormon men than Gentile women in the\r\n     States have yet perceived in their rulers.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The proposed legislation for the Chinese women on the\r\n     Pacific slope and for outcast women in our cities, and the\r\n     opinion of the press that no respectable woman should be seen in\r\n     the streets after dark, are all based upon the presumption that\r\n     woman's freedom must be forever sacrificed to man's licence;\r\n     therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the ballot in woman's hand is the only power by\r\n     which she can restrain the liberty of those men who make our\r\n     streets and highways dangerous to her, and secure the freedom\r\n     that belongs to her by day and by night.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frances E. Willard]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the convention it was decided at a meeting of the\r\nexecutive committee to present an address to the president and both\r\nhouses of congress, and that a printed copy of the resolutions\r\nshould be laid on the desk of every member. The president having\r\ngranted a hearing,[46] the following address was presented:\r\n\r\n     _To his Excellency, the President of the United States_:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Representatives of associations of women waited upon\r\n     your excellency before the delivery of your first and second\r\n     annual messages, asking that in those documents you would\r\n     remember the disfranchised millions of citizens of the United\r\n     States; and,\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Upon careful examination of those messages, we find\r\n     therein specifically enumerated, the interests, great and small,\r\n     of all classes of men, and recommendations of needful legislation\r\n     to protect their civil and political rights, but find no mention\r\n     made of any need of legislation to protect the political, civil,\r\n     or social rights of one-half of the people of this republic, and,\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, There is pending in the Senate a constitutional\r\n     amendment to prohibit the several States from disfranchising\r\n     United States citizens on account of sex, and a similar amendment\r\n     is pending upon a tie vote in the House Judiciary Committee; and\r\n     as petitions to so amend the constitution have been presented to\r\n     both houses of congress from more than 40,000 well-known citizens\r\n     of thirty-five States and five territories,\r\n\r\n     THEREFORE, we respectfully ask your excellency, in your next\r\n     annual message, to make mention of the disfranchised millions of\r\n     wives, mothers and daughters of this republic, and to recommend\r\n     to congress that women equally with men be protected in the\r\n     exercise of their civil and political rights.\r\n\r\n     On behalf of the National Woman Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n                                  ELIZABETH CADY STANTON, _President_.\r\n\r\n     MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, _Corresponding Secretary_.\r\n     SUSAN B. ANTHONY, _Chairman Executive Committee_.\r\n\r\nThe delegates from the territory of Utah were also received by the\r\npresident. They called his attention to the effect of the\r\nenforcement of the law of 1862 upon 50,000 Mormon women, to render\r\nthem outcasts and their children nameless, asking the chief\r\nexecutive of the nation to give some time to the consideration of\r\nthe bill pending under different headings in both houses. The\r\npresident asked them to set forth the facts in writing, that he\r\nmight carefully weigh so important a matter. A memorial was also\r\npresented to congress by these ladies, closing thus:\r\n\r\n     We further pray that in any future legislation concerning the\r\n     marriage relation in any territory under your jurisdiction you\r\n     will consider the rights and the consciences of the women to be\r\n     affected by such legislation, and that you will consider the\r\n     permanent care and welfare of children as the sure foundation of\r\n     the State.\r\n\r\n     And your petitioners will ever pray.\r\n\r\n                                   EMMELINE B. WELLS.\r\n                                   ZINA YOUNG WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\nMr. Cannon of Utah moved that the memorial be referred to the\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary with leave to report at any time. It was\r\nso referred. The Judiciary Committee of the Senate brought in a\r\nbill legitimatizing the offspring of plural marriages to a certain\r\ndate; also authorizing the president to grant amnesty for past\r\noffenses against the law of 1862.\r\n\r\nThe _Congressional Record_ of January 24, under the head of\r\npetitions and memorials, said:\r\n\r\n     The vice-president, Mr. Wheeler of New York, presented the\r\n     petition of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Matilda Joslyn Gage and Susan\r\n     B. Anthony, officers of the National Association, praying for the\r\n     passage of Senate joint resolution No. 12, providing for an\r\n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States, protecting\r\n     the rights of women, and also that the House Judiciary Committee\r\n     be relieved from the further consideration of a similar\r\n     resolution.\r\n\r\n     Mr. FERRY--If there be no objection I ask that the petition be\r\n     read at length.\r\n\r\n     The VICE-PRESIDENT--The Chair hears no objection, and it will be\r\n     reported by the secretary.\r\n\r\n     The petition was read and referred to the Committee on Privileges\r\n     and Elections, as follows:\r\n\r\n          _To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\n          States, in Congress assembled:_\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, More than 40,000 men and women, citizens of\r\n          thirty-five States and five territories, have petitioned the\r\n          forty-fifth congress asking for an amendment to the federal\r\n          constitution prohibiting the several States from\r\n          disfranchising United States citizens on account of sex; and\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, A resolution providing for such constitutional\r\n          amendment is upon the calendar (Senate resolution No. 12,\r\n          second session forty-fifth congress), and a similar\r\n          resolution is pending upon a tie vote in the Judiciary\r\n          Committee of the House of Representatives; and\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, The women of the United States constitute one-half\r\n          of the people of this republic and have an inalienable right\r\n          to an equal voice with men in the nation's councils; and\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, Women being denied the right to have their opinions\r\n          counted at the ballot-box, are compelled to hold all other\r\n          rights subject to the favors and caprices of men; and\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, In answer to the appeals of so large a number of\r\n          honorable petitioners, it is courteous that the forty-fifth\r\n          congress should express its opinion upon this grave question\r\n          of human rights; therefore,\r\n\r\n          We pray your honorable body to take from the calendar and\r\n          pass Senate resolution No. 12, providing for an amendment to\r\n          the constitution protecting the rights of women; and\r\n\r\n          We further pray you to relieve the House Judiciary Committee\r\n          from the further consideration of the woman suffrage\r\n          resolution brought to a tie vote in that committee, February\r\n          5, 1878, that it may be submitted to the House of\r\n          Representatives for immediate action.\r\n\r\n          And your petitioners will ever pray.\r\n\r\n                                  ELIZABETH CADY STANTON, _President_.\r\n\r\n          MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, _Corresponding Secretary_.\r\n          SUSAN B. ANTHONY, _Chairman Executive Committee_.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the last session of the forty-fifth congress most\r\nearnest appeals (copies of which were sent to every member of\r\ncongress) came from all directions for the presentation of a\r\nminority report from the Committee on Privileges and Elections. The\r\nresponse from our representatives was prompt and most encouraging.\r\nThe first favorable report our question had ever received in the\r\nSenate of the United States was presented by the Hon. George F.\r\nHoar, February 1, 1879:\r\n\r\n     _The undersigned, a minority of the Committee on Privileges and\r\n     Elections, to whom were referred the resolution proposing an\r\n     amendment to the constitution prohibiting discrimination in the\r\n     right of suffrage on account of sex, and certain petitions in aid\r\n     of the same, submit the following minority report:_\r\n\r\n     The undersigned dissent from the report of the majority of the\r\n     committee. The demand for the extension of the right of suffrage\r\n     to women is not new. It has been supported by many persons in\r\n     this country, in England and on the continent, famous in public\r\n     life, in literature and in philosophy. But no single argument of\r\n     its advocates seems to us to carry so great a persuasive force as\r\n     the difficulty which its ablest opponents encounter in making a\r\n     plausible statement of their objections. We trust we do not fail\r\n     in deference to our esteemed associates on the committee when we\r\n     avow our opinion that their report is no exception to this rule.\r\n\r\n     The people of the United States and of the several States have\r\n     founded their political institutions upon the principle that all\r\n     men have an equal right to a share in the government. The\r\n     doctrine is expressed in various forms. The Declaration of\r\n     Independence asserts that \"all men are created equal\" and that\r\n     \"governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\r\n     governed.\" The Virginia bill of rights, the work of Jefferson and\r\n     George Mason, affirms that \"no man or set of men are entitled to\r\n     exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the rest of\r\n     the community but in consideration of public services.\" The\r\n     Massachusetts bill of rights, the work of John Adams, besides\r\n     reaffirming these axioms, declares that \"all the inhabitants of\r\n     this commonwealth, having such qualifications as they shall\r\n     establish by their frame of government, have an equal right to\r\n     elect officers, and to be elected for public employment.\" These\r\n     principles, after full and profound discussion by a generation of\r\n     statesmen whose authority upon these subjects is greater than\r\n     that of any other that ever lived, have been accepted by\r\n     substantially the whole American people as the dictates alike of\r\n     practical wisdom and of natural justice. The experience of a\r\n     hundred years has strengthened their hold upon the popular\r\n     conviction. Our fathers failed in three particulars to carry\r\n     these principles to their logical result. They required a\r\n     property qualification for the right to vote and to hold office.\r\n     They kept the negro in slavery. They excluded women from a share\r\n     in the government. The first two of these inconsistencies have\r\n     been remedied. The property test no longer exists. The fifteenth\r\n     amendment provides that race, color, or previous servitude shall\r\n     no longer be a disqualification. There are certain qualifications\r\n     of age, of residence, and, in some instances of education,\r\n     demanded; but these are such as all sane men may easily attain.\r\n\r\n     This report is not the place to discuss or vindicate the\r\n     correctness of this theory. In so far as the opponents of woman\r\n     suffrage are driven to deny it, for the purpose of an argument\r\n     addressed to the American people, they are driven to confess that\r\n     they are in the wrong. This people are committed to the doctrine\r\n     of universal suffrage by their constitutions, their history and\r\n     their opinions. They must stand by it or fall by it. The poorest,\r\n     humblest, feeblest of sane men has the ballot in his hand, and no\r\n     other man can show a better title to it. Those things wherein men\r\n     are unequal--intelligence, ability, integrity, experience, title\r\n     to public confidence by reason of previous public service--have\r\n     their natural and legitimate influence under a government wherein\r\n     each man's vote is counted, to quite as great a degree as under\r\n     any other form of government that ever existed.\r\n\r\n     We believe that the principle of universal suffrage stands to-day\r\n     stronger than ever in the judgment of mankind. Some eminent and\r\n     accomplished scholars, alarmed by the corruption and recklessness\r\n     manifested in our great cities, deceived by exaggerated\r\n     representations of the misgovernment of the Southern States by a\r\n     race just emerging from slavery, disgusted by the extent to which\r\n     great numbers of our fellow-citizens have gone astray in the\r\n     metaphysical subtleties of financial discussion, have uttered\r\n     their eloquent warnings of the danger of the failure of universal\r\n     suffrage. Such utterances from such sources have been frequent.\r\n     They were never more abundant than in the early part of the\r\n     present century. They are, when made in a serious and patriotic\r\n     spirit, to be received with the gratitude due to that greatest of\r\n     public benefactors--he who points out to the people their dangers\r\n     and their faults.\r\n\r\n     But popular suffrage is to be tried not by comparison with ideal\r\n     standards of excellence, but by comparison with other forms of\r\n     government. We are willing to submit our century of it to this\r\n     test. The crimes that have stained our history have come chiefly\r\n     from its denial, not from its establishment. The misgovernment\r\n     and corruption of our great cities have been largely due to men\r\n     whose birth and training have been under other systems. The\r\n     abuses attributed by political hostility to negro governments at\r\n     the South--governments from which the intelligence and education\r\n     of the State held themselves sulkily aloof--do not equal those\r\n     which existed under the English or French aristocracy within the\r\n     memory of living men. There have been crimes, blunders,\r\n     corruptions, follies in the history of our republic. Aristides\r\n     has been banished from public employment, while Cleon has been\r\n     followed by admiring throngs. But few of these things have been\r\n     due to the extension of the suffrage. Strike out of our history\r\n     the crimes of slavery, strike out the crimes, unparalleled for\r\n     ferocity and brutality, committed by an oligarchy in its attempt\r\n     to overthrow universal suffrage, and we may safely challenge for\r\n     our national and State governments comparison with monarchy or\r\n     aristocracy in their best and purest periods.\r\n\r\n     Either the doctrines of the Declaration of Independence and the\r\n     bills of rights are true, or government must rest on no principle\r\n     of right whatever, but its powers may be lawfully taken by force\r\n     and held by force by any person or class who have strength to do\r\n     it, and who persuade themselves that their rule is for the public\r\n     interest. Either these doctrines are true, or you can give no\r\n     reason for your own possession of the suffrage except that you\r\n     have got it. If this doctrine be sound, it follows that no class\r\n     of persons can rightfully be excluded from their equal share in\r\n     the government, unless they can be proved to lack some quality\r\n     essential to the proper exercise of political power.\r\n\r\n     A person who votes helps, first, to determine the measures of\r\n     government; second, to elect persons to be intrusted with public\r\n     administration. He should therefore possess, first, an honest\r\n     desire for the public welfare; second, sufficient intelligence to\r\n     determine what measure or policy is best; third, the capacity to\r\n     judge of the character of persons proposed for office; and,\r\n     fourth, freedom from undue influence, so that the vote he casts\r\n     is his own, and not another's. That person or class casting his\r\n     or their own vote, with an honest desire for the public welfare,\r\n     and with sufficient intelligence to judge what measure is\r\n     advisable and what person may be trusted, fulfill every condition\r\n     that the State can rightfully impose.\r\n\r\n     We are not now dealing with the considerations which should\r\n     affect the admission of citizens of other countries to acquire\r\n     the right to take part in our government. All nations claim the\r\n     right to impose restrictions on the admission of foreigners\r\n     trained in attachment to other countries or forms of rule, and to\r\n     indifference to their own, whatever they deem the safety of the\r\n     State requires. We take it for granted that no person will deny\r\n     that the women of America are inspired with a love of country\r\n     equal to that which animates their brothers and sons. A capacity\r\n     to judge of character, so sure and rapid as to be termed\r\n     intuitive, is an especial attribute of woman. One of the greatest\r\n     orators of modern times has declared:\r\n\r\n          I concede away nothing which I ought to assert for our sex\r\n          when I say that the collective womanhood of a people like\r\n          our own seizes with matchless facility and certainty on the\r\n          moral and personal peculiarities and character of marked and\r\n          conspicuous men, and that we may very wisely address\r\n          ourselves to such a body to learn if a competitor for the\r\n          highest honors has revealed that truly noble nature that\r\n          entitled him to a place in the hearts of a nation.\r\n\r\n     We believe that in that determining of public policies by the\r\n     collective judgment of the State which constitutes\r\n     self-government, the contribution of woman will be of great\r\n     importance and value. To all questions into the determination of\r\n     which considerations of justice or injustice enter, she will\r\n     bring a more refined moral sense than that of man. The most\r\n     important public function of the State is the provision for the\r\n     education of youths. In those States in which the public school\r\n     system has reached its highest excellence, more than ninety per\r\n     cent. of the teachers are women. Certainly the vote of the women\r\n     of the State should be counted in determining the policy that\r\n     shall regulate the school system which they are called to\r\n     administer.\r\n\r\n     It is seldom that particular measures of government are decided\r\n     by direct popular vote. They are more often discussed before the\r\n     people after they have taken effect, when the party responsible\r\n     for them is called to account. The great measures which go to\r\n     make up the history of nations are determined not by the voters,\r\n     but by their rulers, whether those rulers be hereditary or\r\n     elected. The plans of great campaigns are conceived by men of\r\n     great military genius and executed by great generals. Great\r\n     systems of finance come from the brain of statesmen who have made\r\n     finance a special study. The mass of the voters decide to which\r\n     party they will intrust power. They do not determine particulars.\r\n     But they give to parties their general tone and direction, and\r\n     hold them to their accountability. We believe that woman will\r\n     give to the political parties of the country a moral temperament\r\n     which will have a most beneficent and ennobling effect on\r\n     politics.\r\n\r\n     Woman, also, is specially fitted for the performance of that\r\n     function of legislative and executive government which, with the\r\n     growth of civilization, becomes yearly more and more\r\n     important--the wise and practical economic adjustment of the\r\n     details of public expenditures. It may be considered that it\r\n     would not be for the public interest to clothe with the suffrage\r\n     any class of persons who are so dependent that they will, as a\r\n     general rule, be governed by others in its exercise. But we do\r\n     not admit that this is true of women. We see no reason to believe\r\n     that women will not be as likely to retain their independence of\r\n     political judgment, as they now retain their independence of\r\n     opinion in regard to the questions which divide religious sects\r\n     from one another. These questions deeply excite the feelings of\r\n     mankind, yet experience shows that the influence of the wife is\r\n     at least as great as that of the husband in determining the\r\n     religious opinion of the household. The natural influence exerted\r\n     by members of the same family upon each other would doubtless\r\n     operate to bring about similarity of opinion on political\r\n     questions as on others. So far as this tends to increase the\r\n     influence of the family in the State, as compared with that of\r\n     unmarried men, we deem it an advantage. Upon all questions which\r\n     touch public morals, public education, all which concern the\r\n     interest of the household, such a united exertion of political\r\n     influence cannot be otherwise than beneficial.\r\n\r\n     Our conclusion, then, is that the American people must extend the\r\n     right of suffrage to woman or abandon the idea that suffrage is a\r\n     birthright. The claim that universal suffrage will work mischief\r\n     in practice is simply a claim that justice will work mischief in\r\n     practice. Many honest and excellent persons, while admitting the\r\n     force of the arguments above stated, fear that taking part in\r\n     politics will destroy those feminine traits which are the charm\r\n     of woman, and are the chief comfort and delight of the household.\r\n     If we thought so we should agree with the majority of the\r\n     committee in withholding assent to the prayer of the petitioners.\r\n     This fear is the result of treating the abuses of the political\r\n     function as essential to its exercise. The study of political\r\n     questions, the forming an estimate of the character of public men\r\n     or public measures, the casting a vote, which is the result of\r\n     that study and estimate, certainly have in themselves nothing to\r\n     degrade the most delicate and refined nature. The violence, the\r\n     fraud, the crime, the chicanery, which, so far as they have\r\n     attended masculine struggles for political power, tend to prove,\r\n     if they prove anything, the unfitness of men for the suffrage,\r\n     are not the result of the act of voting, but are the expressions\r\n     of course, criminal and evil natures, excited by the desire for\r\n     victory. The admission to the polls of delicate and tender women\r\n     would, without injury to them, tend to refine and elevate the\r\n     politics in which they took a part. When, in former times, women\r\n     were excluded from social banquets, such assemblies were scenes\r\n     of ribaldry and excess. The presence of women has substituted for\r\n     them the festival of the Christian home.\r\n\r\n     The majority of the committee state the following as their\r\n     reasons for the conclusion to which they come:\r\n\r\n          _First_--If the petitioners' prayer be granted it will make\r\n          several millions of female voters.\r\n\r\n          _Second_--These voters will be inexperienced in public\r\n          affairs.\r\n\r\n          _Third_--They are quite generally dependent on the other\r\n          sex.\r\n\r\n          _Fourth_--They are incapable of military duty.\r\n\r\n          _Fifth_--They are without the power to enforce the laws\r\n          which their numerical strength may enable them to make.\r\n\r\n          _Sixth_--Very few of them wish to assume the irksome and\r\n          responsible duties which this measure thrusts upon them.\r\n\r\n          _Seventh_--Such a change should only be made slowly and in\r\n          obedience to a general public demand.\r\n\r\n          _Eighth_--There are but thirty thousand petitioners.\r\n\r\n          _Ninth_--It would be unjust to impose \"the heavy burden of\r\n          governing, which so many men seek to evade, on the great\r\n          mass of women who do not wish for it, to gratify the few who\r\n          do.\"\r\n\r\n          _Tenth_--Women now have the sympathy of judges and juries\r\n          \"to an extent which would warrant loud complaint on the part\r\n          of their adversaries of the sterner sex.\"\r\n\r\n          _Eleventh_--Such a change should be made, if at all, by the\r\n          States. Three-fourths of the States should not force it on\r\n          the others. In any State in which \"any considerable part of\r\n          the women wish for the right to vote, it will be granted\r\n          without the intervention of congress.\"\r\n\r\n     The first objection of the committee is to the large increase of\r\n     the number of the voting population. We believe on the other\r\n     hand, that to double the numbers of the constituent body, and to\r\n     compose one-half that body of women, would tend to elevate the\r\n     standard of the representative both for ability and manly\r\n     character. Macaulay in one of his speeches on the Reform bill\r\n     refers to the quality of the men who had for half a century been\r\n     members for the five most numerous constituencies in\r\n     England--Westminster, Southwark, Liverpool, Bristol and Norwich.\r\n     Among them were Burke, Fox, Sheridan, Romilly, Windham, Tierney,\r\n     Canning, Huskisson. Eight of the nine greatest men who had sat in\r\n     parliament for forty years sat for the five largest represented\r\n     towns. To increase the numbers of constituencies diminishes the\r\n     opportunity for corruption. Size is itself a conservative force\r\n     in a republic. As a permanent general rule the people will desire\r\n     their own best interest. Disturbing forces, evil and selfish\r\n     passions, personal ambitions, are necessarily restricted in their\r\n     operation. The larger the field of operation, the more likely are\r\n     such influences to neutralize each other.\r\n\r\n     The objection of inexperience in public affairs applies, of\r\n     course, alike to every voter when he first votes. If it be valid,\r\n     it would have prevented any extension of the suffrage, and would\r\n     exclude from the franchise a very large number of masculine\r\n     voters of all ages.\r\n\r\n     That women are quite generally dependent on the other sex is\r\n     true. So it is true that men are quite generally dependent on the\r\n     other sex. It is impossible so to measure this dependence as to\r\n     declare that man is more dependent on woman or woman upon man. It\r\n     is by no means true that the dependence of either on the other\r\n     affects the right to the suffrage.\r\n\r\n     Capacity for military duty has no connection with capacity for\r\n     suffrage. The former is wholly physical. It will scarcely be\r\n     proposed to disfranchise men who are unfit to be soldiers by\r\n     reason of age or bodily infirmity. The suggestion that the\r\n     country may be plunged into wars by a majority of women who are\r\n     secure from military dangers is not founded in experience. Men of\r\n     the military profession, and men of the military age are commonly\r\n     quite as eager for war as non-combatants, and will hereafter be\r\n     quite as indifferent to its risks and hardships as their mothers\r\n     and wives.\r\n\r\n     The argument that women are without the power to enforce the laws\r\n     which their numerical strength may enable them to make, proceeds\r\n     from the supposition that it is probable that all the women will\r\n     range themselves upon one side in politics and all the men on the\r\n     other. Such supposition flatly contradicts the other arguments\r\n     drawn from the dependence of women and from their alleged\r\n     unwillingness to assume political burdens. So men over fifty\r\n     years of age are without the power to enforce obedience to laws\r\n     against which the remainder of the voters forcibly rebel. It is\r\n     not physical power alone, but power aided by the respect for law\r\n     of the people, on which laws depend for their enforcement.\r\n\r\n     The sixth, eighth and ninth reasons of the committee are the same\r\n     proposition differently stated. It is that a share in the\r\n     government of the country is a burden, and one which, in the\r\n     judgment of a majority of the women of the country, they ought\r\n     not to be required to assume. If any citizen deem the exercise of\r\n     this franchise a burden and not a privilege, such person is under\r\n     no constraint to exercise it. But if it be a birthright, then it\r\n     is obvious that no other power than that of the individual\r\n     concerned can rightfully restrain its exercise. The committee\r\n     concede that women ought to be clothed with the ballot in any\r\n     State where any considerable part of the women desire it. This is\r\n     a pretty serious confession. On the vital, fundamental question\r\n     whether the institutions of this country shall be so far changed\r\n     that the number of persons in it who take a part in the\r\n     government shall be doubled, the judgment of women is to be and\r\n     ought to be decisive. If woman may fitly determine this question,\r\n     for what question of public policy is she unfit? What question of\r\n     equal importance will ever be submitted to her decision? What has\r\n     become of the argument that women are unfit to vote because they\r\n     are dependent on men, or because they are unfit for military\r\n     duty, or because they are inexperienced, or because they are\r\n     without power to enforce obedience to their laws?\r\n\r\n     The next argument is that by the present arrangement the\r\n     administration of justice is so far perverted that one-half the\r\n     citizens of the country have an advantage from the sympathies of\r\n     juries and judges which \"would warrant loud complaint\" on the\r\n     part of the other half. If this be true, it is doubtless due to\r\n     an instinctive feeling on the part of juries and judges that\r\n     existing laws and institutions are unjust to women, or to the\r\n     fact that juries composed wholly of men are led to do injustice\r\n     by their susceptibility to the attractions of women. But\r\n     certainly it is a grave defect in any system of government that\r\n     it does not administer justice impartially, and the existence of\r\n     such a defect is a strong reason for preferring an arrangement\r\n     which would remove the feeling that women do not have fair play,\r\n     or for so composing juries that, drawn from both sexes, they\r\n     would be impartial between the two.\r\n\r\n     The final objection of the committee is that \"such a change\r\n     should be made, if at all, by the States. Three-fourths of the\r\n     States should not force it upon the others. Whenever any\r\n     considerable part of the women in any State wish for the right to\r\n     vote, it will be granted without the intervention of congress.\"\r\n     Who can doubt that when two-thirds of congress and three-fourths\r\n     of the States have voted for the change, a considerable number of\r\n     women in the other States will be found to desire it, so that,\r\n     according to the committee's own belief, it can never be forced\r\n     by a majority on unwilling communities? The prevention of unjust\r\n     discrimination by States against large classes of people in\r\n     respect to suffrage is even admitted to be a matter of national\r\n     concern and an important function of the national constitution\r\n     and laws. It is the duty of congress to propose amendments to the\r\n     constitution whenever two-thirds of both houses deem them\r\n     necessary. Certainly an amendment will be deemed necessary, if it\r\n     can be shown to be required by the principles on which the\r\n     constitution is based, and to remove an unjust disfranchisement\r\n     from one-half the citizens of the country. The constitutional\r\n     evidence of general public demand is to be found not in\r\n     petitions, but in the assent of three-fourths of the States\r\n     through their legislatures or conventions.\r\n\r\n     The lessons of experience favor the conclusion that woman is fit\r\n     for a share in government. It may be true that in certain\r\n     departments of intellectual effort the greatest achievements of\r\n     women have as yet never equaled the greatest achievements of\r\n     men. But it is equally true that in those same departments women\r\n     have exhibited an intellectual ability very far beyond that of\r\n     the average of men and very far beyond that of most men who have\r\n     shown very great political capacity. But let the comparison be\r\n     made in regard to the very thing with which we have to deal. Of\r\n     men who have swayed chief executive power, a very considerable\r\n     proportion have attained it by usurpation or by election,\r\n     processes which imply extraordinary capacity on their part as\r\n     compared with other men. The women who have held such power have\r\n     come to it as sovereigns by inheritance, or as regents by the\r\n     accident of bearing a particular relation to the lawful sovereign\r\n     when he was under some incapacity. Yet it is an undisputed fact\r\n     that the number of able and successful female sovereigns bears a\r\n     vastly greater proportion to the whole number of such sovereigns,\r\n     than does the number of able and successful male sovereigns to\r\n     the whole number of men who have reigned. An able, energetic,\r\n     virtuous king or emperor is the exception and not the rule in the\r\n     history of modern Europe. With hardly an exception the female\r\n     sovereigns or regents have been wise and popular. Mr. Mill, who\r\n     makes this point, says:\r\n\r\n          We know how small a number of reigning queens history\r\n          presents in comparison with that of kings. Of this small\r\n          number a far larger proportion have shown talents for rule,\r\n          though many of them have occupied the throne in difficult\r\n          periods. When to queens and empresses we add regents and\r\n          viceroys of provinces, the list of women who have been\r\n          eminent rulers of mankind swells to a great length....\r\n          Especially is this true if we take into consideration Asia\r\n          as well as Europe. If a Hindoo principality is strongly,\r\n          vigilantly and economically governed; if order is preserved\r\n          without oppression; if cultivation is extending and the\r\n          people prosperous, in three cases out of four that\r\n          principality is under a woman's rule. This fact, to me an\r\n          entirely unexpected one, I have collected from a long\r\n          official knowledge of Hindoo governments.\r\n\r\n     Certainly history gives no warning that should deter the American\r\n     people from carrying out the principles upon which their\r\n     government rests to this most just and legitimate conclusion.\r\n     Those persons who think that free government has anywhere failed,\r\n     can only claim that this tends to prove, not the failure of\r\n     universal suffrage, but the failure of masculine suffrage. Like\r\n     failure has attended the operation of every other great human\r\n     institution, the family, the school, the church, whenever woman\r\n     has not been permitted to contribute to it her full share. As to\r\n     the best example of the perfect family, the perfect school, the\r\n     perfect church, the love, the purity, the truth of woman are\r\n     essential, so they are equally essential to the perfect example\r\n     of the self-governing State.\r\n\r\n                                             GEO. F. HOAR,\r\n                                             JOHN H. MITCHELL,\r\n                                             ANGUS CAMERON.\r\n\r\nThousands of copies of this report were published and franked to\r\nevery part of the country. On February 7, just one week after the\r\npresentation of the able minority report, the bill allowing women\r\nto practice before the Supreme Court passed the Senate[47] and\r\nreceived the signature of President Hayes. Senators McDonald, Hoar\r\nand Sargent made the principal speeches. We give Mr. Hoar's speech\r\nin full because of its terse and vigorous presentation of the fact\r\nthat congress is a body superior to the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates. Mr. Hoar said:\r\n\r\n     _Mr. President_--I understand the brief statement which was made,\r\n     I think, during this last session by the majority of the\r\n     Judiciary Committee in support of their opposition to this bill,\r\n     did not disclose that the majority of that committee were opposed\r\n     to permitting women to engage in the practice of law or to be\r\n     admitted to practice it in the Supreme Court of the United\r\n     States, but the point they made, was that the legislation of the\r\n     United States left to the Supreme Court the power of determining\r\n     by rule who should be admitted to practice before that tribunal,\r\n     and that we ought not by legislation to undertake to interfere\r\n     with its rules. Now, with the greatest respect for that tribunal,\r\n     I conceive that the law-making and not the law-expounding power\r\n     in this government ought to determine the question what class of\r\n     citizens shall be clothed with the office of the advocate. I\r\n     believe that leaving to the Supreme Court by rule to determine\r\n     the qualifications or disqualifications of attorneys and\r\n     counselors in that court is an exception to the nearly uniform\r\n     policy of the States of the Union. Would it be tolerated if the\r\n     Supreme Court undertook by rule to establish any other\r\n     disqualification, any of those disqualifications which have\r\n     existed in regard to holding any other office in the country?\r\n     Suppose the court were of the opinion we had been too fast in\r\n     relieving persons who took part in the late rebellion from their\r\n     disabilities, and that it would not admit persons who had so\r\n     taken part to practice before the Supreme Court; is there any\r\n     doubt that congress would at once interfere? Suppose the Supreme\r\n     Court were of opinion that the people of the United States had\r\n     erred in the amendment which had removed the disqualification\r\n     from colored persons and declined to admit such persons to\r\n     practice in that court; is there any doubt that congress would\r\n     interfere and would deem it a fit occasion for the exercise of\r\n     the law-making power?\r\n\r\n     Now, Mr. President, this bill is not a bill merely to admit women\r\n     to the privilege of engaging in a particular profession; it is a\r\n     bill to secure to the citizen of the United States the right to\r\n     select his counsel, and that is all. At present a case is tried\r\n     and decided in the State courts of any State of this Union which\r\n     may be removed to the Supreme Court of the United States. In the\r\n     courts of the State, women are permitted to practice as\r\n     advocates, and a woman has been the advocate under whose\r\n     direction and care and advocacy the case has been won in the\r\n     court below. Is it tolerable that the counsel who has attended\r\n     the case from its commencement to its successful termination in\r\n     the highest court of the State should not be permitted to attend\r\n     upon and defend the rights of that client when the case is\r\n     transferred to the Supreme Court of the United States? Everybody\r\n     knows, at least every lawyer of experience knows, the\r\n     impossibility of transferring with justice to the interests of a\r\n     client, a cause from one counsel to another. A suit is instituted\r\n     under the advice of a counsel on a certain theory, a certain\r\n     remedy is selected, a certain theory of the cause is the one on\r\n     which it is staked. Now that must be attended to and defended by\r\n     the counsel under whose advice the suit has taken its shape; the\r\n     pleadings have been shaped in the courts below.\r\n\r\n     Under the present system, a citizen of any State in the Union\r\n     having selected a counsel of good moral character who has\r\n     practiced three years, who possesses all-sufficient professional\r\n     and personal qualifications, and having had a cause brought to a\r\n     successful result in the State court, is denied by the present\r\n     existing and unjust rule having counsel of his choice argue the\r\n     cause in the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\n     The greatest master of human manners, who read the human heart\r\n     and who understood better than any man who ever lived the\r\n     varieties of human character, when he desired to solve just what\r\n     had puzzled the lawyers and doctors, placed a woman upon the\r\n     judgment seat; and yet, under the present existing law, if Portia\r\n     herself were alive, she could not defend the opinion she had\r\n     given, before the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe press commented favorably upon this new point gained for women.\r\nWe give a few extracts:\r\n\r\n     The senators who voted to-day against the bill \"to relieve\r\n     certain legal disabilities of women\" are marked men and have\r\n     reason to fear the result of their action.--[Telegraph to the New\r\n     York _Tribune_, February 7.\r\n\r\n     The women get into the Supreme Court in spite of the\r\n     determination of the justices. They gained a decided advantage\r\n     to-day in the passage by the Senate of a bill providing that any\r\n     woman who shall have been a member of the highest court in any\r\n     State or territory, or of the Supreme Court of the District of\r\n     Columbia, for three years, may be admitted to the Supreme Court.\r\n     The bill was called up by Senator McDonald, in antagonism to Mr.\r\n     Edmunds' amendment to the constitution which was the pending\r\n     order. Mr. Edmunds objected to the consideration of the bill and\r\n     voted against it. There was not much discussion, the main\r\n     speeches being by Mr. Sargent and Mr. Hoar.--[Special dispatch to\r\n     the New York _World_, February 7.\r\n\r\n     A WOMAN'S RIGHTS VICTORY IN THE SENATE.--The Lockwood bill,\r\n     giving women authority to practice before the Supreme Court of\r\n     the United States, passed the Senate yesterday by a vote of two\r\n     to one, and now it only requires the approval of Mr. Hayes to\r\n     become a law. The powerful effect of persistent and industrious\r\n     lobbying is manifested in the success of this bill. When it was\r\n     first introduced, it is doubtful if one-fourth the members of\r\n     congress would have voted for it. Some of the strong-minded\r\n     women, who were interested in the bill, stuck to it, held the\r\n     fort from day to day, and talked members and senators into\r\n     believing it a just measure. Senator McDonald gave Mr. Edmunds a\r\n     rebuff yesterday that he will not soon forget. The latter\r\n     attempted to administer a rebuke to the Indiana senator for\r\n     calling up a bill during the absence of the senator who had\r\n     reported it. Mr. McDonald retorted that he knew the objection of\r\n     the senator from Vermont was made for the purpose of defeating\r\n     the bill and not, as pretended, to give an absent senator\r\n     opportunity to speak upon it.--[Washington _Post_, February 8.\r\n\r\n     The credit for this victory belongs to Mrs. Belva Lockwood, of\r\n     this city, who, having been refused admission to the bar of the\r\n     United States Supreme Court, appealed to congress, and by dint of\r\n     hard work has finally succeeded in having her bill passed by both\r\n     houses. She called on Mrs. Hayes last evening, who complimented\r\n     her upon her achievement, and informed her that she had sent a\r\n     bouquet to Senator Hoar, in token of his efforts in behalf of the\r\n     bill.--[Washington _Star_, February 8.\r\n\r\n     The bill was carried through merely by the energetic advocacy of\r\n     Senators McDonald, Sargent and Hoar, whose oratorical efforts\r\n     were reenforced by the presence of Mrs. Lockwood. After the\r\n     struggle was over, all the senators who advocated the bill were\r\n     made the recipients of bouquets, while the three senators whose\r\n     names we have given received large baskets of flowers. This is a\r\n     pleasing omen of that purification of legal business which it is\r\n     hoped will flow from the introduction of women to the courts. It\r\n     was not flowers that used to be distributed at Washington and\r\n     Albany in the old corrupt times, among legislators, in testimony\r\n     of gratitude for their votes. Let us hope that venal legislation\r\n     at Washington will be extirpated by the rise of this beautiful\r\n     custom.--[New York _Nation_.\r\n\r\n     It was noticeable that all the presidential candidates dodged the\r\n     issue except Senator Blaine, who voted for the bill.--[Chicago\r\n     _Inter-Ocean_.\r\n\r\n     How humiliated poor old Judge Magruder must feel, since the\r\n     congress of the United States paid the woman whom he forbade to\r\n     open her mouth in his august presence, in his little court, so\r\n     much consideration as to pass an act opening to her the doors of\r\n     the Supreme Court of the United States. All honor to the brave\r\n     woman, who by her own unaided efforts thus achieved honor,\r\n     fortune and fame--the just rewards of her own true\r\n     worth.--[_Havre Republican_, Havre de Grace, Maryland.\r\n\r\n     ENTER PORTIA.--An act of congress was not necessary to authorize\r\n     women to be lawyers, if their legal acquirements fitted them for\r\n     that vocation; nor was it necessary to state, as an expression of\r\n     opinion by the national legislature, that some women are so fully\r\n     qualified for the legal profession that no barriers should be\r\n     permitted to stand in their way. It was needed simply as a key\r\n     whereby the hitherto locked door of the Supreme Court of the\r\n     United States may be opened if a woman lawyer, with the usual\r\n     credentials, should knock thereon. That is all; and there is no\r\n     new question opened for profitless debate. The ability of some\r\n     women to be lawyers is like the ability of others to make\r\n     bread--it rests upon the facts. There is no room for elaborate\r\n     argument to prove either their fitness or unfitness for legal\r\n     studies, so long as in Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan, the\r\n     District of Columbia, Iowa and North Carolina there are women in\r\n     more or less successful practice and repute. * * * Nowhere are\r\n     these great attributes of civilization and regulated\r\n     liberty--law, conservatism, justice, equity and mercy in the\r\n     administration of human affairs put in broader light or truer,\r\n     than they are by the words that Shakespeare puts in the mouth of\r\n     this woman jurist.--[_Public Ledger_, Philadelphia, February 12.\r\n\r\n     When congress recently passed a law allowing women to practice in\r\n     the Supreme Court, it was not a subject of any special or eager\r\n     comment. A woman who is a lawyer sent flowers to the desks of the\r\n     members who voted for the bill, and before they had faded,\r\n     comment was at an end. The home was still safe and the country\r\n     was not in peril. It was one of the questions which had settled\r\n     itself and was a foregone conclusion. * * * United States Senator\r\n     Edmunds of Vermont, has fallen into disfavor with the ladies for\r\n     voting against the above bill.--[From John W. Forney's\r\n     _Progress_, February 22.\r\n\r\nOn March 3, by motion of Hon. A. G. Riddle, Mrs. Lockwood was\r\nadmitted to the bar of the United States Supreme Court,[48] taking\r\nthe official oath and receiving the classic sheep-skin; and the\r\nfollowing week she was admitted to practice before the Court of\r\nClaims. The forty-sixth congress contained an unusually large\r\nproportion of new representatives, fresh from the people, ready for\r\nthe discussion of new issues, and manifesting a chivalric spirit\r\ntoward the consideration of woman's claims as a citizen. On\r\nTuesday, April 29, the following resolution was submitted to the\r\nCommittee on Rules in the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That a select committee of nine members be appointed\r\n     by the speaker, to be called a Committee on the Rights of Women,\r\n     whose duty it shall be to consider and report upon all petitions,\r\n     memorials, resolutions and bills that may be presented in the\r\n     House relating to the rights of women.\r\n\r\nAdmitting the justice of a fair consideration of a question\r\ninvolving every human right of one-half of the population of this\r\ncountry, Alex. H. Stephens of Georgia, James A. Garfield of Ohio,\r\nWm. P. Frye of Maine, immediately declared themselves in favor of\r\nthe appointment of said committee, and Speaker Randall, the\r\nchairman, ordered it reported to the House. A similar resolution\r\nwas introduced in the Senate, before the adjournment of the special\r\nsession. This showed a clearer perception of the magnitude of the\r\nquestion, and the need of its early and earnest consideration, than\r\nat any time during the previous thirty years of argument, heroic\r\nstruggle and sacrifice on the altar of woman's freedom.\r\n\r\nThe anniversary of 1879 was held in St. Louis, Missouri, May 7, 8,\r\n9. Mrs. Virginia L. Minor and Miss Phoebe W. Couzins made all\r\npossible arrangements for the success of the meeting and the\r\ncomfort of the delegates.[49] Mrs. Minor briefly stated the object\r\nof the convention and announced that, as the president of the\r\nassociation had not arrived, Mrs. Joslyn Gage would take the chair.\r\nMiss Couzins gave the address of welcome:\r\n\r\n     _Mrs. President and Members of the National Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association:_\r\n\r\n     It becomes my pleasant duty to welcome you to the hospitalities\r\n     of my native city. To extend to you who for the first time meet\r\n     beyond the Mississippi, a greeting--not only in behalf of the\r\n     friends of woman suffrage, but for those of our citizens who,\r\n     while not in full sympathy with your views, have a desire to hear\r\n     you in deliberative council and to cordially tender you the same\r\n     courtesies offered other conventions which have chosen St. Louis\r\n     as their place of annual gathering.\r\n\r\n     And I am the more happy to do this because of the opportunity it\r\n     affords me to disabuse your minds of certain impressions which\r\n     have gone abroad concerning our slowness of action in the line of\r\n     advanced ideas. Certainly in some phases of that reformation to\r\n     which you and your co-laborers have pledged your lives, your\r\n     fortunes--the cause of woman--St. Louis is the leader.\r\n\r\n     When, eighteen or twenty years since, Harriet Hosmer desired to\r\n     study anatomy, to perfect herself in her art, not a college in\r\n     New England would open its doors to her; she traveled West, and\r\n     through the generous patronage of Wayman Crow of this city, she\r\n     became a pupil of the dean of the St. Louis Medical college.\r\n\r\n     When other cities had refused equality of wages and position, St.\r\n     Louis placed Miss Brackett at the head of our normal school,\r\n     giving her--a heretofore exclusively male prerogative--the\r\n     highest wages, added to the highest educational rank.\r\n\r\n     And here in St. Louis began the advance march which has finally\r\n     broken down the walls of the highest judicial fortress, the\r\n     Supreme Court of the United States. Washington University, in\r\n     response to my request, unhesitatingly opened its doors, and for\r\n     the first time in the history of America, woman was accorded the\r\n     right to a legal course of training with man, and, at its close,\r\n     after successful examination, I was freely accorded the degree of\r\n     Bachelor of Laws! A city or a State that could perpetrate the\r\n     anomaly of a female bachelor, is certainly not far behind the\r\n     radicalism of the age.\r\n\r\n     Again, as I turn to its record on suffrage, I find as early as\r\n     1866 the Hon. B. Gratz Brown of Missouri made a glowing speech\r\n     for woman's enfranchisement, in the United States Senate, on Mr.\r\n     Cowan's motion to strike out \"male\" from the District of Columbia\r\n     suffrage bill, which resulted in an organization in 1867, through\r\n     the efforts of Mrs. Virginia L. Minor, its first president. And\r\n     again, I remember when that hydra-headed evil arose in our midst,\r\n     degrading all women and violating all the sweet and sacred\r\n     sanctities of life--a blow at our homes and a lasting stigma on\r\n     our civilization--the people of this community, led by the\r\n     chancellor of Washington University, at the ballot-box but\r\n     recently laid that monster away in a tomb, never, I trust, to be\r\n     resurrected.\r\n\r\n     And now, Mrs. President, let me add, in words which but faintly\r\n     express the emotion of my heart, the gratitude we feel towards\r\n     the noble women who have borne the burden and heat of the day.\r\n     They who have been ridiculed, villified, maligned, but through it\r\n     all maintained an unswerving allegiance to truth. In the name of\r\n     all true womanhood I welcome this association in our midst as\r\n     worthy of the highest honor.\r\n\r\n     We have lived to see the enlargement of woman's thought in all\r\n     directions. From our laboratories, libraries, observatories,\r\n     schools of medicine and law, universities of science, art and\r\n     literature, she is advancing to the examination of the problems\r\n     of life, with an eye single only to the glory of truth. Like the\r\n     Spartan of old she has thrown her spear into the thickest of the\r\n     fray, and will fight gloriously in the midst thereof till she\r\n     regains her own. No specious sophistry or vain delusion--no\r\n     time-honored tradition or untenable doctrine can evade her\r\n     searching investigation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gage responded to this address in a few earnest, appropriate\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nOf the many letters[50] read in the convention none was received\r\nwith greater joy than the few lines, written with trembling hand,\r\nfrom Lucretia Mott, then in the eighty-seventh year of her age:\r\n\r\n                                   ROADSIDE, Fourth Month, 26, 1879.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SUSAN ANTHONY--It would need no urgent appeal to draw me\r\n     to St. Louis had I the strength for the journey. You will have no\r\n     need of my worn-out powers. Our cause itself has become\r\n     sufficiently attractive. Edward M. Davis has a joint letter on\r\n     hand for my signature, so this is enough, with my mite toward\r\n     expenses. And to all assembled in St. Louis best wishes for--yes,\r\n     full faith in your success. I have signed Edward's letter, so it\r\n     is hardly necessary for me to say,\r\n\r\n                                             LUCRETIA MOTT.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing feature of this convention was an afternoon\r\nsession of ladies alone, prompted by an attempt to reenact a law\r\nfor the license of prostitution, which had been enforced in St.\r\nLouis a few years before and repealed through the united efforts of\r\nthe best men and women of the city. Mrs. Joslyn Gage opened the\r\nmeeting by reading extracts from the Woman's Declaration of Rights\r\npresented at the centennial celebration, and drew especial\r\nattention to the clause referring to two separate codes of morals\r\nfor men and women, arising from woman's inferior political\r\nposition:\r\n\r\n     There are two points which may be considered open for discussion\r\n     during the afternoon--one, the fact that there are existing in\r\n     all forms of society, barbaric, semi-civilized, civilized or\r\n     enlightened, two separate codes of morals; the strict code to\r\n     which women are held accountable, and the lax code which governs\r\n     the conduct of men.\r\n\r\n     The other question which can very properly be discussed at the\r\n     present time is, \"Why in this country, and in all civilized\r\n     nations, do one-half of the population die under five years of\r\n     age, and in some countries a very large proportion under one\r\n     year?\"\r\n\r\nA letter was read from Mrs. Josephine E. Butler. As the experiment\r\nof licensing prostitution had been extensively tried in England,\r\nand she had watched the effects of the system not only in her own\r\ncountry but on the continent, her opinions on this question are\r\nworthy of consideration:\r\n\r\n     _To the Annual Meeting of the National Suffrage Association in\r\n     St. Louis:_\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIENDS--As I am unable to be present at your convention on\r\n     May 7, 8, 9, and as you ask for a communication from me, I gladly\r\n     write you on some of the later phases of our struggle against\r\n     legalized prostitution. A brave battle has been fought in St.\r\n     Louis against that iniquity, and we have regarded it with\r\n     sympathy and admiration; but you are not yet safe against the\r\n     devices of those who uphold this white slavery, nor are we safe,\r\n     although we know that in the end we shall be conquerors. You tell\r\n     me that \"England is held up as an example of the beneficial\r\n     working of the legalizing of vice.\" England holds a peculiar\r\n     position in regard to the question. She was the last to adopt\r\n     this system of slavery and she adopted it in that thorough manner\r\n     which characterizes the Anglo-Saxon race. In no other country has\r\n     prostitution been regulated by law. It has been understood by the\r\n     Latin races, even when morally enervated, that the law could not\r\n     without risk of losing its majesty violate justice. In England\r\n     alone the regulations are law. Their promoters, by their\r\n     hardihood in asking parliament to decree injustice, have brought\r\n     on unconsciously to themselves, the beginning of the end of the\r\n     whole system. The Englishman is a powerful agent for evil as for\r\n     good. In the best times of our history my countrymen possessed\r\n     preeminently vigorous minds in vigorous bodies. But when the\r\n     animal nature has outgrown the moral, the appetites burst their\r\n     proper restraints, and man has no other notion of enjoyment save\r\n     bodily pleasure; he passes by a quick and easy transition into a\r\n     powerful brute. And this is what the upper-class Englishman has\r\n     to a deplorable extent become. There is no creature in the world\r\n     so ready as he to domineer, to enslave, to destroy. But together\r\n     with this development towards evil, there has been in our country\r\n     a counter development. Moral faith is still strong among us.\r\n     There are powerful women, as well as strong, pure, and\r\n     self-governed men, of the real old Anglo-Saxon type. It was in\r\n     England then, which adopted last the hideous slavery, that there\r\n     arose first a strong national protest in opposition. English\r\n     people rose up against the wicked law before it had been in\r\n     operation three months. English men and women determined to carry\r\n     abolition not at home only, but abroad, and they promptly carried\r\n     their standard to every country on the continent of Europe. In\r\n     all these countries men and women came forward at the first\r\n     appeal, and said, \"We are ready, we only waited for you,\r\n     Anglo-Saxons, to take the lead; we have groaned under the\r\n     oppression, but there was not force enough among us to take the\r\n     initiative step.\"\r\n\r\n     We have recently had a visit from Monsieur Aimi Humbert of\r\n     Switzerland, our able general secretary for the continent. Much\r\n     encouragement was derived from the reports which reached us from\r\n     France, Holland, Denmark, Sweden and even Spain, where a noble\r\n     lady, Donna Concepcion Arenal of Madrid, and several gentlemen\r\n     have warmly espoused our cause. The progress is truly\r\n     encouraging; yet, on the other hand, it is obvious that the\r\n     partisans of this legislation have recently been smitten with a\r\n     kind of rage for extending the system everywhere, and are on the\r\n     watch to introduce it wherever we are off our guard. In almost\r\n     all British colonies they are very busy. At the Cape of Good\r\n     Hope, where the Cape parliament had repealed the law, the\r\n     governor, Sir Bartle Frere, has been induced by certain\r\n     specialists and immoral men, to reintroduce it. But since he\r\n     could not count on the parliament at Cape Town for doing this, he\r\n     has reintroduced the miserable system by means of a proclamation\r\n     or edict, without the sanction and probably, to a great extent,\r\n     without the knowledge of parliament. The same game is being\r\n     played in other colonies. These facts seem to point to a more\r\n     decided and bitter struggle on the question than we have yet\r\n     seen. An energetic member of our executive committee, M. Pierson\r\n     of Zetten, in Holland, says:\r\n\r\n          I look upon legalized prostitution as the system in which\r\n          the immorality of our age is crystalized, and that in\r\n          attacking it we attack in reality the great enemies which\r\n          are hiding themselves behind its ramparts. But if we do not\r\n          soon overthrow these ramparts we must not think our work is\r\n          fruitless. A great work is already achieved; sin is once\r\n          more called sin instead of necessary evil, and the true\r\n          standard of morality--equal for men and women, for rich and\r\n          poor--is once more raised in the face of all the nations.\r\n\r\n     This legalization of vice which recognized the \"necessity\" of\r\n     impurity for man and the institution of slavery for woman, is the\r\n     most open denial which modern times have seen of the principle of\r\n     the sacredness of the individual human being. It is the\r\n     embodiment of socialism in its worst form. An English high-class\r\n     journal confessed this, when it dared to demand that women who\r\n     are unchaste shall henceforth be dealt with \"not as human beings,\r\n     but as foul sewers,\" or some such \"material nuisance\" without\r\n     souls, without rights and without responsibilities. When the\r\n     leaders of public opinion in a country have arrived at such a\r\n     point of combined depotism as to recommend such a manner of\r\n     dealing with human beings, there is no crime which that country\r\n     may not legalize. Were it possible to secure the absolute\r\n     physical health of a whole province, or an entire continent by\r\n     the destruction of one, only one poor and sinful woman, woe to\r\n     that nation which should dare, by that single act of destruction,\r\n     to purchase this advantage to the many! It will do it at its\r\n     peril.\r\n\r\n     We entreat our friends in America to renew their alliance with us\r\n     in the sacred conflict. Union will be strength. The women of\r\n     England are beginning to understand their responsibilities. Like\r\n     yourselves, we are laboring to obtain the suffrage. The wrong\r\n     which has fallen upon us in this legalizing of vice has taught us\r\n     the need of power in legislation. Meanwhile, the crusade against\r\n     immorality is educating women for the right use of suffrage when\r\n     they obtain it. The two movements must go hand in hand.\r\n\r\nAltogether this was an impressive occasion in which women met heart\r\nto heart in discussing the deepest humiliations of their sex. After\r\neloquent speeches by Mrs. Meriwether, Mrs. Spencer, Mrs. Leonard,\r\nMrs. Thompson and Rev. Olympia Brown, the audience slowly\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nThe closing scenes of the evening were artistic and interesting.\r\nThe platform was tastefully decked with flags and flowers, and the\r\nimmense audience that had assembled at an early hour--hundreds\r\nunable to gain admission--made this the crowning session of the\r\nconvention. Miss Couzins announced the receipt of an invitation\r\nfrom Mr. John Wahl, inviting the convention to visit the Merchants'\r\nExchange, \"with assurances of high regard.\" The announcement was\r\nheard with considerable merriment by those who remembered her\r\ncriticisms on Mr. Wahl for his failure to deliver the address of\r\nwelcome at the opening of the convention. She also announced the\r\nreceipt of an invitation from Secretary Kalb to visit the\r\nfair-grounds, and moved that the convention first visit the\r\nExchange and then proceed to the fair-grounds in carriages, the\r\nmembers of the Merchants' Exchange, of course paying the bill. The\r\nmotion was carried amidst applause. An invitation was also received\r\nfrom Dr. Eliot, chancellor of Washington University, to attend the\r\nart lecture of Miss Schoonmaker at the Mary Institute, Monday\r\nevening. In a letter to the editor of the _National Citizen_, Mrs.\r\nStanton thus describes the incident of the evening:\r\n\r\n     The delegates from the different States, through May Wright\r\n     Thompson of Indianapolis, presented Miss Anthony with two baskets\r\n     of exquisite flowers. She referred in the most happy way to Miss\r\n     Anthony's untiring devotion to all the unpopular reforms through\r\n     years of pitiless persecution, and thanked her in behalf of the\r\n     young womanhood of the nation, that their path had been made\r\n     smoother by her brave life. Miss Anthony was so overcome with the\r\n     delicate compliments and the fragrant flowers at her feet, that\r\n     for a few moments she could find no words to express her\r\n     appreciation of the unexpected acknowledgement of what all\r\n     American women owe her. As she stood before that hushed audience,\r\n     her silence was more eloquent than words, for her emotion was\r\n     shared by all. With an effort she at last said:\r\n\r\n          Friends, I have no words to express my gratitude for this\r\n          marked attention. I have so long been the target for\r\n          criticism and ridicule, I am so unused to praise, that I\r\n          stand before you surprised and disarmed. If any one had come\r\n          to this platform and abused all womankind, called me hard\r\n          names, ridiculed our arguments or denied the justice of our\r\n          demands, I could with readiness and confidence have rushed\r\n          to the defence, but I cannot make any appropriate reply for\r\n          this offering of eloquent words and flowers, and I shall not\r\n          attempt it.\r\n\r\n     Being advertised as the speaker of the evening, she at once began\r\n     her address, and as she stood there and made an argument worthy a\r\n     senator of the United States, I recalled the infinite patience\r\n     with which, for upwards of thirty years, she had labored for\r\n     temperance, anti-slavery and woman suffrage, with a faithfulness\r\n     worthy the martyrs in the early days of the Christian church, and\r\n     said to myself, verily the world now as ever crucifies its\r\n     saviors.\r\n\r\n     Thanks to the untiring industry of Mrs. Minor and Miss Couzins,\r\n     the convention was in every way a success, morally, financially,\r\n     in crowded audiences, and in the fair, respectful and\r\n     complimentary tone of the press. Looking over the proceedings and\r\n     resolutions, the thought struck me that the National Association\r\n     is the only organization that has steadily maintained the\r\n     doctrine of federal power against State rights. The great truths\r\n     set forth in the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments of United\r\n     States supremacy, so clearly seen by us, seem to be vague and dim\r\n     to our leading statesmen and lawyers if we may judge by their\r\n     speeches and decisions. Your superb speech on State rights should\r\n     be published in tract form and scattered over this entire nation.\r\n     How can we ever have a homogeneous government so long as\r\n     universal principles are bounded by State lines.\r\n\r\nThe delegates remaining in the city went on Change in a body at 12\r\no'clock Saturday, on invitation of the president, John Wahl. They\r\nwere courteously received and speeches were made by Mesdames\r\nCouzins, Stanton, Anthony, Meriwether and Thompson. Mrs.\r\nMeriwether's speech was immediately telegraphed in full to Memphis.\r\nAll wore badges of silk on which in gold letters appeared \"N. W. S.\r\nA., May 10, 1879, Merchants' Exchange.\" From the Exchange the\r\nladies proceeded in carriages to the fair-grounds, and Zooelogical\r\nGardens where they took refreshments.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday evening Miss Couzins gave a delightful reception. Her\r\nparlors were crowded until a late hour, where the friends of woman\r\nsuffrage had an opportunity to use their influence socially in\r\nconverting many distinguished guests. On Sunday night Mrs. Stanton\r\nwas invited by the Rev. Ross C. Houghton to occupy his pulpit in\r\nthe Union Methodist church, the largest in the city of that\r\ndenomination. She preached from the text in Genesis i., 27, 28. The\r\nsermon was published in the _St. Louis Globe_ the next morning.[51]\r\nMrs. Thompson was also invited to occupy a Presbyterian pulpit,\r\nbut imperative duties compelled her to leave the city.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm aroused by the convention in woman's enfranchisement\r\nwas encouraging to those who had so long and earnestly labored in\r\nthis cause.[52] This was indeed a week of profitable work. With\r\narguments and appeals to man's reason and sense of justice on the\r\nplatform, to his religious emotions and conscience in the pulpit,\r\nto his honor and courtesy in the parlor, all the varied influences\r\nof public and private life were exerted with marked effect; while\r\nthe press on the wings of the wind carried the glad tidings of a\r\nnew gospel for woman to every town and hamlet in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] The annual convention of the National Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation will be held in Lincoln Hall, Washington, D. C.,\r\nJanuary 16, 17, 1877.\r\n\r\nAs by repeated judicial decisions, woman's right to vote under the\r\nfourteenth amendment has been denied, we must now unitedly demand a\r\nsixteenth amendment to the United States Constitution, that shall\r\nsecure this right to the women of the nation. In certain States and\r\nterritories where women had already voted, they have been denied\r\nthe right by legislative action. Hence it must be clear to every\r\nthinking mind that this fundamental right of citizenship must not\r\nbe left to the ignorant majorities in the several States; for\r\nunless it is secured everywhere, it is safe nowhere.\r\n\r\nWe urge all suffrage associations and friends of woman's\r\nenfranchisement throughout the country to send delegates to this\r\nconvention, freighted with mammoth petitions for a sixteenth\r\namendment. Let all other proposed amendments be held in abeyance to\r\nthe sacred rights of the women of this nation. The most reverent\r\nrecognition of God in the constitution would be justice and\r\nequality for woman. On behalf of the National Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation,\r\n\r\n                                  ELIZABETH CADY STANTON, _President_.\r\n      MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, _Chairman Ex.

Slocum,\r\nMrs. Hooker, Mrs. Gage and Acting-Governor Lee of Wyoming\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n[23] This reception-room, a great convenience to the ladies\r\nvisiting the Capitol, has since been removed; and a small, dark,\r\ninaccessible room on the basement floor set aside for their use.\r\n\r\n[24] _Yeas_--Anthony, Bruce, Burnside, Cameron of Wis., Dawes,\r\nFerry, Hoar, Matthews, Mitchell, Rollins, Sargent, Saunders,\r\nTeller--13.\r\n\r\n_Nays_--Bailey, Bayard, Beck, Booth, Butler, Christiancy, Cockrell,\r\nCoke, Conkling, Davis of W.

Thompson of\r\nOregon, Marilla M. Ricker, Julia E. Smith, Rev. Olympia Brown, Mrs.\r\nBlake, Mrs. Lockwood, Mrs. Spencer, Mrs. Gage, Mrs. Stanton, Dr.\r\nLozier and others.\r\n\r\n[26] This argument was subsequently given before the Committee on\r\nPrivileges and Elections and will be found on page 80.\r\n\r\n[27] The members of the committee were Belva A. Lockwood, Matilda\r\nJoslyn Gage, Mary A. Thompson, M. D., Marilla M. Ricker, Elizabeth\r\nBoynton Harbert.\r\n\r\n[28] At this hearing the speakers were Clemence S. Lozier, M. D.,\r\nNew York; Julia E. Smith, Connecticut; Elizabeth Cady Stanton, New\r\nJersey; Elizabeth Boynton Harbert, Illinois; Matilda Joslyn Gage,\r\nNew York; Priscilla Rand Lawrence, Massachusetts; Rev. Olympia\r\nBrown, Connecticut; Mary A. Thompson, M. D., Oregon; Mary Powers\r\nFilley, New Hampshire; Lillie Devereux Blake, New York; Sara\r\nAndrews Spencer, District of Columbia; Isabella Beecher Hooker,\r\nConnecticut; Mary A. Stewart, Delaware.\r\n\r\n[29] In the whole course of our struggle for equal rights I never\r\nfelt more exasperated than on this occasion, standing before a\r\ncommittee of men many years my juniors, all comfortably seated in\r\narmchairs, I pleading for rights they all enjoyed though in no\r\nrespect my superiors, denied me on the shallow grounds of sex. But\r\nthis humiliation I had often felt before. The peculiarly\r\naggravating feature of the present occasion was the studied\r\ninattention and contempt of the chairman, Senator Wadleigh of New\r\nHampshire. Having prepared my argument with care, I naturally\r\ndesired the attention of every member of the committee, all of\r\nwhich, with the exception of Senator Wadleigh, I seemingly had. He\r\nhowever took special pains to show that he did not intend to\r\nlisten. He alternately looked over some manuscripts and newspapers\r\nbefore him, then jumped up to open or close a door or window. He\r\nstretched, yawned, gazed at the ceiling, cut his nails, sharpened\r\nhis pencil, changing his occupation and position every two minutes,\r\neffectually preventing the establishment of the faintest magnetic\r\ncurrent between the speakers and the committee. It was with\r\ndifficulty I restrained the impulse more than once to hurl my\r\nmanuscript at his head.--[E. C. S.\r\n\r\n[30] The first hearing was held in the committee room, but that not\r\nbeing large enough to accommodate the crowds that wished to hear\r\nthe arguments, the use of the Senate reception room was granted for\r\nthe second, which although very much larger, was packed, with the\r\ncorridors leading to it, long before the committee took their\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n[31] Mr. and Mrs. Holt, of 1,339 L street, entertained their\r\nfriends and a numerous company of distinguished guests on Friday\r\nevening, in honor of Mrs. Beecher Hooker. She delivered one of her\r\nablest speeches on the woman suffrage question. She was listened to\r\nwith breathless silence by eminent men and women, who confessed, at\r\nthe termination of her speech, that they were \"almost persuaded\" to\r\njoin her ranks--the highest tribute to her eloquent defense of her\r\nposition. Mrs. Hooker's intellect is not her only charm. Her\r\nbeautiful face and attractive manners all help to make converts.\r\nMrs. Julia N. Holmes, the poet, one of the most admired ladies\r\npresent, and Mrs. Southworth, the novelist, wore black velvet and\r\ndiamonds. Mrs. Hodson Burnett, that \"Lass o' Lowrie,\" in colored\r\nand rose silk with princess scarf, looked charmingly. Mrs. Senator\r\nSargent, Mrs. Charles Nordhoff and her friends, the elegant Miss\r\nThurman, of Cincinnati, and Miss Joseph, a brilliant brunette with\r\nscarlet roses and jet ornaments, of Washington, were much observed.\r\nMrs. Dr. Wallace, of the _New York Herald_, wore cuir colored\r\ngros-grain with guipure lace trimmings, flowers and diamonds. Miss\r\nCoyle was richly attired. Mrs. Ingersoll, wife of the exceptional\r\norator, was the center of observation with Mrs. Hooker; she wore\r\nblack velvet, roses, and diamonds--has a noble presence and Grecian\r\nface. General Forney, of Alabama, Hon. John F. Wait, M. C., Captain\r\nDutton and Colonel Mallory, of U. S. Army, Judge Tabor (Fourth\r\nAuditor), Dr. Cowes, Col. Ingersol, Mrs. Hoffman, of New York, a\r\nprominent lady of the Woman's Congress, lately assembled in this\r\ncity, wore a distinguished toilette. Mrs. Spofford, of the Riggs\r\nHouse, was among the most noticeable ladies present, elegant and\r\ndelightful in style and manner. Dr. Josephs and Col. G. W. Rice, of\r\nBoston, were of the most conspicuous gentlemen present, who retired\r\nmuch edified with the entertainment of the evening.\r\n\r\n                                             H. LOUISE GATES.\r\n\r\nSociety was divided Saturday evening between the literary club\r\nwhich met at Willard's under the auspices of Mrs. Morrell, and the\r\nreception given at the residence of Senator Rollins, on Capitol\r\nHill, to Mrs. Beecher Hooker, who spoke on the question of woman\r\nsuffrage. It was said of Theodore Parker, if all his hearers stood\r\non the same lofty plane that he did, his theology would be all\r\nright for them, and so in this matter of woman's rights. If all the\r\nadvocates were as cultivated, refined, and convincing as Mrs.\r\nHooker, one might almost be tempted to surrender. She certainly\r\npossesses that rare magnetic influence which seems to say, \"Lend me\r\nyour ears and I shall take your heart.\" Among her listeners we\r\nnoticed Mrs. Joseph Ames, Grace Greenwood, Senator and Mrs.\r\nRollins, Senator and Mrs. Wadleigh, Miss Rollins, Mrs. Solomon\r\nBundy, Mrs. J. M. Holmes, Mrs. Brainerd, Mr. and Mrs. Doolittle,\r\nDr. Patton and son, Prof. Thomas Taylor, Miss Robena Taylor, Mrs.\r\nSpofford, of the Riggs House, Prof. G. B. Stebbins, Mrs. Captain\r\nPlatt, and Mr. and Mrs. Holt.--[Washington _Post_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[32] The members of the committee present were Hon. Proctor Knott\r\n(the chairman), General Benjamin F. Butler, Messrs. Lynde, Frye,\r\nConger, Lapham, Culberson, McMahon. Among the ladies were Mesdames\r\nKnott, Conger, Lynde, Frye.\r\n\r\n[33] Mrs. Hooker has won, just as we predicted she would. Senators\r\nHowe, Ferry, Coke, Randolph, Jones, Blaine, Beck, Booth, Allison,\r\nWallace, Eaton, Johnston, Burnside, Saulsbury, Merrimon, and\r\nPresiding-officer Wheeler, together with nineteen other senators,\r\nhave formally invited her to address the Committee on Privileges\r\nand Elections on February 22, an invitation which she has\r\nenthusiastically accepted. Nobody but congressmen will be admitted\r\nto hear the distinguished advocate of woman suffrage.--[Washington\r\n_Post_.\r\n\r\n[34] Among those present were Mrs. Senator Beck, Mrs. Stanley\r\nMatthews, Mrs. Sargent, Mrs. Spofford, Mrs. Holmes, Mrs. Snead,\r\nMrs. Baldwin, Miss Blodgett of New York; Mrs. Baldwin, Mrs.\r\nSpencer, Mrs. Juan Lewis of Philadelphia; Mrs. Morgan of\r\nMississippi, Mrs. Brooks, Mrs. Olcott, Mrs. Bartlett, Miss Sweet,\r\nMrs. Myers, Mrs. Gibson, Miss Jenners, Mrs. Levison, Mrs. Hereford,\r\nMrs. Folsom, Mrs. Mitchell, Mrs. Lynde, Mrs. Eldridge, Miss Snowe,\r\nMrs. Curtis, Mrs. Hutchinson Patton, Mrs. Boucher and many others.\r\nOf the committee and Senate there were Senators Wadleigh, Cameron\r\nof Wisconsin; Merrimon, Mitchell, Hoar, Vice-president Wheeler,\r\nSenators Jones, Bruce, Beck and others. Several representatives\r\nand their wives also were there, and seemed deeply\r\ninterested.--[Washington _Post_.\r\n\r\n[35] Mrs. Ricker makes a specialty of looking after the occupants\r\nof the jail--so freely is her purse opened to the poor and\r\nunfortunate that she is known as the prisoners' friend. Many an\r\nalleged criminal owes the dawning of a new life, and the\r\ndetermination to make it a worthy one, to the efforts of this noble\r\nwoman. And Mrs. Ricker's special object in seeking this office was\r\nthat prisoners might make depositions before her and thus be saved\r\nthe expense of employing notaries from the city.\r\n\r\n[36] THE SELFISH RATS--A FABLE BY LILLIE DEVEREUX BLAKE.--Once some\r\ngray old rats built a ship of State to save themselves from\r\ndrowning. It carried them safely for awhile until they grew eager\r\nfor more passengers, and so took on board all manner of rats that\r\nhad run away from all sorts of places--Irish rats and German rats,\r\nand French rats, and even black rats and dirty sewer rats.\r\n\r\nNow there were many lady mice who had followed the rats, and the\r\nrats therefore thought them very nice, but in spite of that would\r\nnot let them have any place on the ship, so that they were forced\r\nto cling to a few planks and were every now and then overwhelmed by\r\nthe waves. But when the mice begged to be taken on board saying,\r\n\"Save us also, we beg you!\" The rats only replied, \"We are too\r\ncrowded already; we love you very much, and we know you are very\r\nuncomfortable, but it is not expedient to make room for you.\" So\r\nthe rats sailed on safely and saw the poor little mice buffeted\r\nabout without doing the least thing to save them.\r\n\r\n_Moral_: Woe to the weaker.\r\n\r\n[37] Senator Blair has just been elected (June, 1885) to a second\r\nterm, thus insuring his services to our cause in the Senate for\r\nanother six years.\r\n\r\n[38] DELEGATES TO THE THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY.--Alabama, Priscilla\r\nHolmes Drake; California, Ellen Clark Sargent; District of\r\nColumbia, Frederick Douglass, Belva A.

Congress is then in session, the\r\nSupreme Court sitting, and society, that mystic, headless, power,\r\nat the height of its glory. Being the season for official\r\nreceptions, where one meets foreign diplomats from every civilized\r\nnation, it is the time chosen by strangers to visit our beautiful\r\ncapital. Washington is the modern Rome to which all roads lead, the\r\nbright cynosure of all eyes, and is alike the hope and fear of\r\nworn-out politicians and aspiring pilgrims. From this great center\r\nvaried influences radiate to the vast circumference of our land.\r\nSupreme-court decisions, congressional debates, presidential\r\nmessages and popular opinions on all questions of fashion,\r\netiquette and reform are heralded far and near, awakening new\r\nthought in every State in our nation and, through their\r\nrepresentatives, in the aristocracies of the old world. Hence to\r\nhold a suffrage convention in Washington is to speak to the women\r\nof every civilized nation.\r\n\r\nThe Twelfth Annual Convention of the National Association assembled\r\nin Lincoln Hall, January 21, 1880. Many distinguished ladies and\r\ngentlemen occupied the platform, which was tastefully decorated\r\nwith flags and flowers, and around the walls hung familiar\r\nmottoes,[53] significant of the demands of the hour. On taking the\r\nchair Susan B. Anthony made some appropriate remarks as to the\r\nimportance of the work of the association during the presidential\r\ncampaign. Mrs. Spencer called the roll, and delegates[54] from\r\nsixteen States responded.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gage read the call:\r\n\r\n     The National Association will hold its twelfth annual convention\r\n     in Lincoln Hall, Washington, D. C., January 21, 22, 1880.\r\n\r\n     The question as to whether we are a nation, or simply a\r\n     confederacy of States, that has agitated the country from the\r\n     inauguration of the government, was supposed to have been settled\r\n     by the war and confirmed by the amendments, making United States\r\n     citizenship and suffrage practically synonymous. Not, however,\r\n     having been pressed to its logical results, the question as to\r\n     the limits of State rights and national power is still under\r\n     discussion, and is the fundamental principle that now divides the\r\n     great national parties. As the final settlement of this principle\r\n     involves the enfranchisement of woman, our question is one of\r\n     national politics, and the real issue of the hour. If it is the\r\n     duty of the general government to protect the freedmen of South\r\n     Carolina and Louisiana in the exercise of their rights as United\r\n     States citizens, the government owes the same protection to the\r\n     women in Massachusetts and New York. This year will again witness\r\n     an exciting presidential election, and this question of momentous\r\n     importance to woman will be the issue then presented. Upon its\r\n     final decision depends not only woman's speedy enfranchisement,\r\n     but the existence of the republic.\r\n\r\n     A sixteenth amendment to the national constitution, prohibiting\r\n     the States from disfranchising United States citizens on the\r\n     ground of sex, will be urged upon the forty-sixth congress by\r\n     petitions, arguments and appeals. The earnest, intelligent and\r\n     far-seeing women of every State should assemble at the coming\r\n     convention, and show by their wise counsels that they are worthy\r\n     to be citizens of a free republic. All associations in the\r\n     United States which believe it is the duty of congress to submit\r\n     an amendment protecting woman in the exercise of the right of\r\n     suffrage, are cordially invited to send delegates. Those who\r\n     cannot attend the convention, are urged to address letters to\r\n     their representatives in congress, asking them to give as careful\r\n     attention to the proposed amendment and to the petitions and\r\n     arguments urged in its behalf, as though the rights of men, only,\r\n     were involved. A delegate from each section of the country will\r\n     be heard before the committees of the House and Senate, to whom\r\n     our petitions will be referred.[55]\r\n\r\nMrs. Spencer presented a series of resolutions which were ably\r\ndiscussed by the speakers and adopted:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we are a nation and not a mere confederacy, and\r\n     that the right of citizens of the United States to\r\n     self-government through the ballot should be guaranteed by the\r\n     national constitution and protected everywhere under the national\r\n     flag.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That while States may have the right to regulate the\r\n     time, place and manner of elections, and the qualifications of\r\n     voters upon terms equally applicable to all citizens, they should\r\n     be forbidden under heavy penalties to deprive any citizen of the\r\n     right to self-government on account of sex.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is the duty of the forty-sixth congress to\r\n     immediately submit to the several States the amendment to the\r\n     national constitution recently proposed by Senator Ferry and\r\n     Representative Loring, and approved by the National Suffrage\r\n     Association.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is the duty of the House of Representatives\r\n     to pass immediately the resolution recommended by the Committee\r\n     on Rules directing the speaker to appoint a committee on the\r\n     rights of women.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the giant labor reform of this age lies in\r\n     securing to woman, the great unpaid and unrecognized laborer and\r\n     producer of the whole earth, the fruits of her toil.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the theory of a masculine head to rule the\r\n     family, the church, or the State, is contrary to republican\r\n     principles, and the fruitful source of rebellion and corruption.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the assumption of the clergy, that woman has no\r\n     right to participate in the ministry and offices of the church is\r\n     unauthorized theocratic tyranny, placing a masculine mediator\r\n     between woman and her God, which finds no authority in reason,\r\n     and should be resisted by all women as an odious form of\r\n     religious persecution.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is the duty of the congress of the United\r\n     States to provide a reform school for girls and a home for the\r\n     children whom no man owns or protects, and who are left to die\r\n     upon the streets of the nation's capital, or to grow up in\r\n     ignorance, vice and crime.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That since man has everywhere committed to woman the\r\n     custody and ownership of the child born out of wedlock, and has\r\n     required it to bear its mother's name, he should recognize\r\n     woman's right as a mother to the custody of the child born in\r\n     marriage, and permit it to bear her name.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the National Association will send a delegate\r\n     and an alternate to each presidential nominating convention to\r\n     demand the rights of woman, and to submit to each party the\r\n     following plank for presidential platform: _Resolved_, That the\r\n     right to use the ballot _inheres_ in the citizen of the United\r\n     States, and we pledge ourselves to secure protection in the\r\n     exercise of this right to all citizens irrespective of sex.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That one-half of the number of the supervisors of the\r\n     tenth census, and one-half of the collectors of said census,\r\n     should be educated, intelligent women, who can be safely\r\n     entrusted to enumerate women and children, their occupations,\r\n     ages, diseases and deaths, and who would not be likely to\r\n     overlook ten millions of housekeepers.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That Ulysses S. Grant won his first victories through\r\n     the military plans and rare genius of a woman, Anna Ella Carroll,\r\n     of Maryland, and while he has been rewarded with the presidential\r\n     office through two terms, and a royal voyage around the world,\r\n     crowned with glory and honor, Miss Carroll has for fifteen years\r\n     been suffering in poverty unrecognized and unrewarded.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the thanks of this association are hereby\r\n     tendered to Governor Chas. B. Andrews, of Connecticut, for\r\n     remembering in each annual message to ask for justice to women.\r\n\r\nThe comments of the press[56] were very complimentary, and their\r\ndaily reports of the convention full and fair. Among the many\r\nletters[57] to the convention, the following from a Southern lady\r\nis both novel and amusing:\r\n\r\n                                   MEMPHIS, Tenn., December 11, 1889.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MRS. SPENCER: You want petitions. Well I have two which I\r\n     got up some time ago, but did not send on because I thought the\r\n     names too few to count much. The one is of _white_ women 130 in\r\n     number. The other contains 110 names of black women. This last is\r\n     a curiosity, and was gotten up under the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n     Some ladies were dining with me and we each promised to get what\r\n     names we could to petitions for woman suffrage. My servant who\r\n     waited on table was a coal-black woman. She became interested\r\n     and after the ladies went away asked me to explain the matter to\r\n     her, which I did. She then said if I would give her a paper she\r\n     could get a thousand names among the black women, that many of\r\n     them felt that they were as much slaves to their husbands as ever\r\n     they had been to their white masters. I gave her a petition, and\r\n     said to her, \"Tell the women this is to have a law passed that\r\n     will not allow the men to _whip their wives_, and will put down\r\n     drinking saloons.\" \"Every black woman will go for that law!\" She\r\n     took the paper and procured these 110 signatures against the\r\n     strong opposition of black men who in some cases threatened to\r\n     whip their wives if they signed. At length the opposition was so\r\n     great my servant had not courage to face it. She feared some\r\n     bodily harm would be done her by the black men. You can see this\r\n     is a genuine negro petition from the odd way the names are\r\n     written, sometimes the capital letter in the middle of the name,\r\n     sometimes at the end.\r\n\r\n                         Yours,       ELIZABETH AVERY MERIWETHER.\r\n\r\nIn response to 66,000 documents containing appeals to women, issued\r\nby the National Association, 250 petitions, signed by over 12,000,\r\narrived in Washington in time for presentation to congress before\r\nthe assembling of the convention, and were read on the floor of the\r\nSenate, with the leading names, January 14, 16, 20, 21, by\r\nforty-seven senators.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives this courtesy (reading petitions\r\nand names), requires unanimous consent, and one man, Hon. J. J.\r\nDavis of North Carolina, who had no petition from the women of his\r\nState, objected. Sixty-five representatives presented the petitions\r\nat the clerk's desk, under the rule, January 14, 15, 16. In answer\r\nto these appeals to both Houses, on Monday, January 19, Hon. T. W.\r\nFerry, of Michigan, introduced in the Senate a joint resolution for\r\na sixteenth amendment, which with all the petitions was referred to\r\nthe Committee on the Judiciary. Tuesday, January 20, Hon. George B.\r\nLoring, of Massachusetts, introduced the same resolution in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and it was referred, with all the\r\npetitions, to the Committee on the Judiciary. There were also\r\nduring this congress presented over 300 petitions from law-abiding,\r\ntax-paying women, praying for the removal of their political\r\ndisabilities.\r\n\r\nOn Friday and Saturday, January 23, 24, these committees granted\r\nhearings of two hours each to delegates from ten States who had\r\nbeen in attendance at the convention. Thoughtful attention was\r\ngiven to arguments upon every phase of the question, and senators\r\nand representatives expressed a strong determination to bring the\r\nsubject fairly before the people.\r\n\r\nThe committees especially requested that only the delegates should\r\nbe present, wishing, as they said, to give their sole attention to\r\nthe arguments undisturbed by the crowds who usually seek\r\nadmittance. Even the press was shut out. These private sessions\r\nwith most of the members present, and the close attention they gave\r\nto each speaker, were strong proof of the growth of our reform, as\r\nbut a few years before representatives sought excuses for absence\r\non all such occasions.\r\n\r\n                    THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, U. S. SENATE, }\r\n                                Friday, Jan. 23, 1880.            }\r\n\r\n     The committee assembled at half-past 10 o'clock A.M. Present, Mr.\r\n     Thurman, _chairman_, Mr. McDonald, Mr. Bayard, Mr. Davis of\r\n     Illinois, Mr. Edmunds.\r\n\r\n     The CHAIRMAN: Several members of the committee are unable to be\r\n     here. Mr. Lamar is detained at his home in Mississippi by\r\n     sickness; Mr. Carpenter is confined to his room by sickness; Mr.\r\n     Conkling has been unwell; I do not know how he is this morning;\r\n     and Mr. Garland is chairman of the Committee on Territories,\r\n     which has a meeting this morning that he could not fail to\r\n     attend. I do not think we are likely to have any more members of\r\n     the committee than are here now, and we will hear you, ladies.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ZERELDA G. WALLACE of Indiana said: _Mr. Chairman, and\r\n     Gentlemen of the Committee_: It is scarcely necessary to say that\r\n     there is not an effect without a cause. Therefore it would be\r\n     well for the statesmen of this nation to ask themselves the\r\n     question, What has brought the women from all parts of this\r\n     nation to the capital at this time? What has been the strong\r\n     motive that has taken us away from the quiet and comfort of our\r\n     own homes and brought us before you to-day? As an answer to that\r\n     question I will read an extract from a speech made by one of\r\n     Indiana's statesmen. He found out by experience and gave us the\r\n     benefit of it:\r\n\r\n          You can go to meetings; you can vote resolutions; you can\r\n          attend great demonstrations in the street; but, after all,\r\n          the only occasion where the American citizen expresses his\r\n          acts, his opinions, and his power is at the ballot-box; and\r\n          that little ballot that he drops in there is the written\r\n          sentiment of the times, and it is the power that he has as a\r\n          citizen of this great republic.\r\n\r\n     That is the reason why we are here; the reason why we want to\r\n     vote. We are not seditious women, clamoring for any peculiar\r\n     rights; it is not the woman question that brings us before you\r\n     to-day; it is the human question underlying this movement. We\r\n     love and appreciate our country; we value its institutions. We\r\n     realize that we owe great obligations to the men of this nation\r\n     for what they have done. To their strength we owe the subjugation\r\n     of all the material forces of the universe which give us comfort\r\n     and luxury in our homes. To their brains we owe the machinery\r\n     that gives us leisure for intellectual culture and achievement.\r\n     To their education we owe the opening of our colleges and the\r\n     establishment of our public schools, which give us these great\r\n     and glorious privileges. This movement is the legitimate result\r\n     of this development, and of the suffering that woman has\r\n     undergone in the ages past.\r\n\r\n     A short time ago I went before the legislature of Indiana with a\r\n     petition signed by 25,000 of the best women in the State. I\r\n     appeal to the memory of Judge McDonald to substantiate the truth\r\n     of what I say. Judge McDonald knows that I am a home-loving,\r\n     law-abiding, tax-paying woman of Indiana, and have been for fifty\r\n     years. When I went before our legislature and found that one\r\n     hundred of the vilest men in our State, merely by the possession\r\n     of the ballot, had more influence with our lawmakers than the\r\n     wives and mothers it was a startling revelation.\r\n\r\n     You must admit that in popular government the ballot is the most\r\n     potent means for all moral and social reforms. As members of\r\n     society, we are deeply interested in all the social problems with\r\n     which you have grappled so long unsuccessfully. We do not intend\r\n     to depreciate your efforts, but you have attempted to do an\r\n     impossible thing; to represent the whole by one-half, and because\r\n     we are the other half we ask you to recognize our rights as\r\n     citizens of this republic.\r\n\r\n     JULIA SMITH PARKER of Glastonbury, Conn., said: _Gentlemen_: You\r\n     may be surprised to see a woman of over four-score years appear\r\n     before you at this time. She came into the world and reached\r\n     years of discretion before any person in this room was born. She\r\n     now comes before you to plead that she can vote and have all the\r\n     privileges that men have. She has suffered so much individually\r\n     that she thought when she was young she had no right to speak\r\n     before the men; but still she had courage to get an education\r\n     equal to that of any man at the college, and she had to suffer a\r\n     great deal on that account. She went to New Haven to school, and\r\n     it was noised around that she had studied the languages. It was\r\n     such an astonishing thing for girls at that time to have the\r\n     advantages of education, that I had actually to go to cotillon\r\n     parties to let people see that I had common sense. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n     She has had to pay $200 a year in taxes without knowing what\r\n     becomes of it. She does not know but that it goes to support\r\n     grog-shops. She knows nothing about it. She has had to suffer her\r\n     cows to be sold at the sign-post six times. She suffered her\r\n     meadow land, worth $2,000, to be sold for a tax less than $50. If\r\n     she could vote as the men do she would not have suffered this\r\n     insult; and so much would not have been said against her as has\r\n     been said if men did not have the whole power. I was told that\r\n     they had the power to take anything that I owned if I would not\r\n     exert myself to pay the money. I felt that I ought to have some\r\n     little voice in determining what should be done with what I paid.\r\n     I felt that I ought to own my own property; that it ought not to\r\n     be in these men's hands; and I now come to plead that I may have\r\n     the same privileges before the law that men have. I have seen\r\n     what a difference there is, when I have had my cows sold, by\r\n     having a voter to take my part.\r\n\r\n     I have come from an obscure town on the banks of the Connecticut,\r\n     where I was born. I was brought up on a farm. I never had an idea\r\n     that I should come all the way to Washington to speak before\r\n     those who had not come into existence when I was born. Now, I\r\n     plead that there may be a sixteenth amendment, and that women may\r\n     be allowed the privilege of owning their own property. I have\r\n     suffered so much myself that I felt it might have some effect to\r\n     plead before this honorable committee. I thank you, gentlemen,\r\n     for hearing me so kindly.\r\n\r\n     ELIZABETH L. SAXON of Louisiana, said: _Gentlemen_: I feel that\r\n     after Mrs. Wallace's plea there is no necessity for me to say\r\n     anything. I come from the extreme South, she from the West.\r\n     People have asked me why I came. I care nothing for suffrage\r\n     merely to stand beside men, or rush to the polls, or to take any\r\n     privilege outside of my home, only, as Mrs. Wallace says, for\r\n     humanity. I never realized the importance of this cause, until we\r\n     were beaten back on every side in the work of reform. If we\r\n     attempted to put women in charge of prisons, believing that\r\n     wherever woman sins and suffers women should be there to teach,\r\n     help and guide, every place was in the hands of men. If we made\r\n     an effort to get women on the school-boards we were combated and\r\n     could do nothing.\r\n\r\n     In the State of Texas, I had a niece living whose father was an\r\n     inmate of a lunatic asylum. She exerted as wide an influence as\r\n     any woman in that State; I allude to Miss Mollie Moore, who was\r\n     the ward of Mr. Cushing. I give this illustration as a reason why\r\n     Southern women are taking part in this movement. Mr. Wallace had\r\n     charge of that lunatic asylum for years. He was a good,\r\n     honorable, able man. Every one was endeared to him; the State\r\n     appreciated him as superintendent of this asylum. When a\r\n     political change was made and Gov. Robinson came in, Dr. Wallace\r\n     was ousted for political purposes. It almost broke the hearts of\r\n     some of the women who had sons, daughters or husbands there. They\r\n     determined at once to try and have him reinstated. It was\r\n     impossible, he was out, and what could they do?\r\n\r\n     A gentleman said to me a few days ago, \"These women ought to\r\n     marry.\" I am married; I am a mother; and in our home the sons and\r\n     brothers are all standing like a wall of steel at my back. I have\r\n     cast aside the prejudices of the past. They lie like rotted hulks\r\n     behind me.\r\n\r\n     After the fever of 1878, when our constitutional convention was\r\n     about to convene, I suppressed the agony and grief of my own\r\n     heart (for one of my children had died) and took part in the\r\n     suffrage movement in Louisiana with the wife of Chief-Justice\r\n     Merrick, Mrs. Sarah A. Dorsey, and Mrs. Harriet Keating of New\r\n     York, the niece of Dr. Lozier. These three ladies aided me\r\n     faithfully and ably. I went to Lieutenant-Governor Wiltz, and\r\n     asked him if he would present or consider a petition which I\r\n     wished to bring before the convention. He read the petition. One\r\n     clause of our State law is that no woman can sign a will. Some\r\n     ladies donated property to an asylum. They wrote the will and\r\n     signed it themselves, and it was null and void, because they were\r\n     women. That clause, perhaps, will be wiped out. Many gentlemen\r\n     signed the petition on that account. Governor Wiltz, then\r\n     lieutenant-governor, told me he would present the petition. He\r\n     was elected president of the convention. I presented my first\r\n     petition, signed by the best names in the city of New Orleans\r\n     and in the State. I had the names of seven of the most prominent\r\n     physicians. Three prominent ministers signed it for moral\r\n     purposes alone. When Mrs. Dorsey was on her dying bed the last\r\n     time she ever signed her name was to a letter to go before that\r\n     convention. Mrs. Merrick and myself addressed the convention. We\r\n     made the petition then that we make here; that we, the mothers of\r\n     the land, should not be barred on every side in the cause of\r\n     reform. I pledged my father on his dying bed that I would never\r\n     cease work until woman stood with man equal before the law.\r\n\r\n     I beg of you, gentlemen, to consider this question seriously. We\r\n     stand precisely in the position of the colonies when they plead,\r\n     and, in the words of Patrick Henry, were \"spurned with contempt\r\n     from the foot of the throne.\" We have been jeered and laughed at;\r\n     but the question has passed out of the region of ridicule. This\r\n     clamor for woman suffrage, for woman's rights, for equal\r\n     representation, is extending all over the land.\r\n\r\n     I plead because my work has been combated in the cause of reform\r\n     everywhere that I have tried to accomplish anything. The children\r\n     that fill the houses of prostitution are not of foreign blood and\r\n     race. They come from sweet American homes, and for every woman\r\n     that went down some mother's heart broke. I plead by the power of\r\n     the ballot to be allowed to help reform women and benefit\r\n     mankind.\r\n\r\n     MARY A. STEWART of Delaware said: The negroes are a race\r\n     inferior, you must admit, to your daughters, and yet that race\r\n     has the ballot, and why? It is said they earned it and paid for\r\n     it with their blood. Whose blood paid for yours? The blood of\r\n     your forefathers and our forefathers. Does a man earn a hundred\r\n     thousand dollars and lie down and die, saying, \"It is all my\r\n     boys'\"? Not a bit of it. He dies saying, \"Let my children, be\r\n     they cripples, be they idiots, be they boys, or be they girls,\r\n     inherit all my property alike.\" Then let us inherit the sweet\r\n     boon of the ballot alike. When our fathers were driving the great\r\n     ship of State we were willing to sail as deck or cabin\r\n     passengers, just as we felt disposed; we had nothing to say; but\r\n     to-day the boys are about to run the ship aground, and it is high\r\n     time that the mothers should be asking, \"What do you mean to do?\"\r\n     In our own little State the laws have been very much modified in\r\n     regard to women. My father was the first man to blot out the old\r\n     English law allowing the eldest son the right of inheritance to\r\n     the real-estate. He took the first step, and like all those who\r\n     take first steps in reform he received a mountain of curses from\r\n     the oldest male heirs.\r\n\r\n     Since 1868 I have, by my own individual efforts, by the use of\r\n     hard-earned money, gone to our legislature time after time and\r\n     have had this law and that law passed for the benefit of women;\r\n     and the same little ship of State has sailed on. To-day our men\r\n     are just as well satisfied with the laws in force in our State\r\n     for the benefit of women as they were years ago. A woman now has\r\n     a right to make a will. She can hold bonds and mortgages of her\r\n     own. She has a right to her own property. She cannot sell it\r\n     though, if it is real-estate, simply because the moment she\r\n     marries, her husband has his right of courtesy. The woman does\r\n     not grumble at that; but still when he dies owning real-estate,\r\n     she gets only the rental value of one-third, which is called the\r\n     widow's dower. Now I think the man ought to have the rental value\r\n     of one-third of the woman's maiden property or real-estate, and\r\n     it ought to be called the widower's dower. It would be just as\r\n     fair for one as for the other. All that I want is equality.\r\n\r\n     The women of our State, as I said before, are taxed without\r\n     representation. The tax-gatherer comes every year and demands\r\n     taxes. For twenty years I have paid tax under protest, and if I\r\n     live twenty years longer I shall pay it under protest every time.\r\n     The tax-gatherer came to my place not long since. \"Well,\" said I,\r\n     \"good morning, sir.\" Said he, \"Good morning.\" He smiled and said,\r\n     \"I have come bothering you.\" Said I, \"I know your face well. You\r\n     have come to get a right nice little woman's tongue-lashing.\"\r\n     Said he, \"I suppose so, but if you will just pay your tax I will\r\n     leave.\" I paid the tax, \"But,\" said I, \"remember I pay it under\r\n     protest, and if I ever pay another tax I intend to have the\r\n     protest written and make the tax-gatherer sign it before I pay\r\n     the tax, and if he will not sign that protest then I shall not\r\n     pay, and there will be a fight at once,\" Said he, \"Why do you\r\n     keep all the time protesting against paying this small tax?\" Said\r\n     I, \"Why do you pay your tax?\" \"Well,\" said he, \"I would not pay\r\n     it if I did not vote.\" Said I, \"That is the very reason why I do\r\n     not want to pay it. I cannot vote.\" Who stay at home from the\r\n     election? The women, and the black and white men who have been to\r\n     the whipping-post. Nice company to put your wives and daughters\r\n     in.\r\n\r\n     It is said that the women do not want to vote. Every woman\r\n     sitting here wants to vote, and must we be debarred the privilege\r\n     of voting because some luxurious woman, rolling around in her\r\n     carriage in her little downy nest that some good, benevolent man\r\n     has provided for her, does not want to vote? There was a society\r\n     that existed up in the State of New York called the Covenanters\r\n     that never voted. Were all you men disfranchised because that\r\n     class or sect up in New York would not vote? Did you all pay your\r\n     taxes and stay at home and refrain from voting because the\r\n     Covenanters did not vote? Not a bit of it. You went to the\r\n     election and told them to stay at home if they wanted to, but\r\n     that you, as citizens, were going to take care of yourselves.\r\n     That was right. We, as citizens, want to take care of ourselves.\r\n\r\n     One more thought, and I will be through. The fourteenth and\r\n     fifteenth amendments, in my opinion, and in the opinion of a\r\n     great many smart men in the country, and smart women, too, give\r\n     the right to women to vote without any \"if's\" or \"and's\" about\r\n     it, and the United States protects us in it; but there are a few\r\n     who construe the law to suit themselves, and say that those\r\n     amendments do not mean that, because the congress which passed\r\n     the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments had no such intention.\r\n     Well, if that congress overlooked us, let the wiser congress of\r\n     to-day take the eighth chapter and the fourth verse of the\r\n     Psalms, which says, \"What is man that Thou art mindful of him?\"\r\n     and amend it by adding, \"What is woman, that they never thought\r\n     of her?\"\r\n\r\n     NANCY R. ALLEN of Iowa said: _Mr. Chairman, and Gentlemen of the\r\n     Judiciary Committee_: I am a representative of a large class of\r\n     women of Iowa, who are heavy taxpayers. There is now a petition\r\n     being circulated throughout our State, to be presented to the\r\n     legislature, praying that women be exempted from taxation until\r\n     they have some voice in the management of the affairs of the\r\n     State. You may ask, \"Do not your husbands protect you? Are not\r\n     all the men protecting you?\" We answer that our husbands are\r\n     grand, noble men, who are willing to do all they can for us, but\r\n     there are many who have no husbands and who own a great deal of\r\n     property in the State of Iowa. Particularly in great moral\r\n     reforms the women there feel the need of the ballot. By\r\n     presenting long petitions to the legislature they have succeeded\r\n     in having better temperance laws enacted, but the men have failed\r\n     to elect the officials who will enforce those laws. Consequently\r\n     they have become as dead letters upon the statute books.\r\n\r\n     To refer again to taxes. I have a list showing that in my city\r\n     three women pay more taxes than all the city officials together.\r\n     They are good temperance women. Our city council is composed\r\n     almost entirely of saloon-keepers, brewers and men who patronize\r\n     them. There are some good men, but they are in the minority, and\r\n     the voices of these women are but little regarded. All these\r\n     officials are paid, and we have to help support them. As Sumner\r\n     said, \"Equality of rights is the first of rights.\" If we can only\r\n     be equal with man under the law, it is all that we ask. We do not\r\n     propose to relinquish our domestic life, but we do ask that we\r\n     may be represented.\r\n\r\nRemarks were also made by Mrs. Chandler, Mrs. Archibald and Mrs.\r\nSpencer. The time having expired, the committee voted to give\r\nanother hour to Miss Anthony to state the reasons why we ask\r\ncongress to submit a proposition to the several legislatures for a\r\nsixteenth amendment, instead of asking the States to submit the\r\nquestion to the popular vote of their electors.[58] When Miss\r\nAnthony had finished, the chairman, Senator Thurman of Ohio, said:\r\n\r\n     I have to say, ladies, that you will admit that we have listened\r\n     to you with great attention, and I can certainly say, with great\r\n     interest; your appeals will be duly and earnestly considered by\r\n     the committee.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. WALLACE: I wish to make just one remark in reference to what\r\n     Senator Thurman said as to the popular vote being against woman\r\n     suffrage. The popular vote is against it, but not the popular\r\n     voice. Owing to the temperance agitation in the last six years,\r\n     the growth of the suffrage sentiment among the wives and mothers\r\n     of this nation has largely increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n       HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, WASHINGTON, D. C., Jan. 24, 1880.\r\n\r\n     The CHAIRMAN _pro tem._ (Mr. HARRIS of Virginia): The order of\r\n     business for the present session of the committee is the delivery\r\n     of arguments by delegates of the Woman Suffrage Convention now\r\n     holding its sessions in Washington. I am informed that the\r\n     delegates are in attendance upon the committee. We will be\r\n     pleased to hear them. A list of the names, of the ladies\r\n     proposing to speak, with a memorandum of the limit of time\r\n     allotted to each, has been handed to me for my guidance; and, in\r\n     the absence of the chairman [Mr. Knott] it will be my duty to\r\n     confine the speakers to the number of minutes apportioned to them\r\n     respectively upon the paper before me. As an additional\r\n     consideration for adhering to the regulation, I will mention that\r\n     members of the committee have informed me that, having made\r\n     engagements to be at the departments and elsewhere on business\r\n     appointments, they will be compelled to leave the committee-room\r\n     upon the expiration of the time assigned. The first name upon the\r\n     list is that of Mrs. Emma Mont. McRae of Indiana, to whom five\r\n     minutes are allowed.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. MCRAE said: _Mr. Chairman, and Gentlemen of the Judiciary\r\n     Committee_: In Indiana the cause of woman has made marked\r\n     advancement. At the same time we realize that we need the right\r\n     to vote in order that we may have protection. We need the ballot\r\n     because through the medium of its power alone we can hope to\r\n     wield that influence in the making of laws affecting our own and\r\n     our children's interests.\r\n\r\n     Some recent occurences in Indiana, one in particular in the\r\n     section of the State from which I come, have impressed us more\r\n     sensibly than ever before with the necessity of this right. The\r\n     particular incident to which I refer was this: In the town of\r\n     Muncie, where I reside, a young girl, who for the past five years\r\n     had been employed as a clerk in the post-office, and upon whom a\r\n     widowed mother was dependent for support, was told on the first\r\n     of January that she was no longer needed in the office. She had\r\n     filled her place well; no complaint had been made against her.\r\n     She very modestly asked the postmaster the cause of her\r\n     discharge, and he replied: \"We have a man who has done work for\r\n     the party and we must give that man a place; I haven't room for\r\n     both of you.\" Now, there you have at once the reason why we want\r\n     the ballot; we want to be able to do something for the party in a\r\n     substantial way, so that men may not tell us they have no room\r\n     for us because we do nothing _for the party_. When they have the\r\n     ballot women will work for \"the party\" as a means of enabling\r\n     them to hold places in which they may get bread for their mothers\r\n     and for their children if necessity requires.\r\n\r\n     Miss JESSIE T. WAITE of Illinois said: _Mr. Chairman, and\r\n     Gentlemen of the Judiciary Committee_: In the State of Illinois\r\n     we have attained to almost every right except that of the ballot.\r\n     We have been admitted to all the schools and colleges; we have\r\n     become accustomed to parliamentary usages; to voting in literary\r\n     societies and in all matters connected with the interests of the\r\n     colleges and schools; we are considered members in good standing\r\n     of the associations, and, in some cases, the young ladies in the\r\n     institutes have been told they hold the balance of power. The\r\n     same reason for woman suffrage that has been given by the\r\n     delegate from Indiana [Mrs. McRae] holds good with reference to\r\n     the State of Illinois. Women must have the ballot that they may\r\n     have protection in getting bread for themselves and their\r\n     families, by giving to the party that looks for their support\r\n     some substantial evidence of their strength. Experience has\r\n     demonstrated, especially in the temperance movement, how\r\n     fruitless are all their efforts while the ballot is withheld from\r\n     their hands. They have prayed; they have petitioned; they have\r\n     talked; they have lectured; they have done all they could do,\r\n     except to vote; and yet all avails them nothing. Miss Frances\r\n     Williard presented to the legislature of Illinois a petition of\r\n     such length that it would have reached around this room. It\r\n     contained over 180,000 signatures. The purpose of the petition\r\n     was to have the legislature give the women of the State the right\r\n     to vote upon the question of license or no license in their\r\n     respective districts.\r\n\r\n     In some of the counties of our State we have ladies as\r\n     superintendents of schools and professors in colleges. One of the\r\n     professors in the Industrial University at Champaign is a lady.\r\n     Throughout the State you may find ladies who excel in every\r\n     branch of study and in every trade. It was a lady who took the\r\n     prize at \"the Exposition\" for the most beautiful piece of\r\n     cabinet-work. This is said to have been a marvel of beauty and\r\n     extraordinary as a specimen of fine art. She was a foreigner; a\r\n     Scandinavian, I believe. Another lady is a teacher of\r\n     wood-carving. We have physicians, and there are two attorneys,\r\n     Perry and Martin, now practicing in the city of Chicago.\r\n     Representatives of our sex are also to be found among real-estate\r\n     agents and journalists, while, in one or two instances as\r\n     preachers they have been recognized in the churches.\r\n\r\n     CATHERINE A. STEBBINS of Michigan said: \"Better fifty years of\r\n     Europe than a cycle of Cathay!\" So said the poet; and I say,\r\n     Better a week with these inspired women in conference than years\r\n     of an indifferent, conventional society! Their presence has been\r\n     a blessing to the people of this District, and will prove in the\r\n     future a blessing to our government. These women from all\r\n     sections of our country, with a moral and spiritual enthusiasm\r\n     which seeks to lift the burdens of our government, come to you,\r\n     telling of the obstacles that have beset their path. They have\r\n     tried to heal the stricken in vice and ignorance; to save our\r\n     land from disintegration. One has sought to reform the drunkard,\r\n     to save the moderate drinker, to convert the liquor-seller;\r\n     another, to shelter the homeless; another, to lift and save the\r\n     abandoned woman. \"Abandoned?\" once asked a prophet-like man of\r\n     our time, who added, \"There never was an abandoned woman without\r\n     an abandoned man!\" Abandoned of whom? let us ask. Surely not by\r\n     the merciful Father. No; neither man nor woman is ever abandoned\r\n     by him, and he sends his instruments in the persons of some of\r\n     these great-hearted women, to appeal to you to restore their\r\n     God-given freedom of action, that \"the least of these\" may be\r\n     remembered.\r\n\r\n     But in our councils no one has dwelt upon _one_ of the great\r\n     evils of our civilization, the scourge of war; though it has been\r\n     said that women will fight. It is true there are instances in\r\n     which they have considered it a duty; there were such in the\r\n     rebellion. But the majority of women would not declare war, would\r\n     not enlist soldiers and would not vote supplies and equipments,\r\n     because many of the most thoughtful believe there _is_ a better\r\n     way, and that women can bring a moral power to bear that shall\r\n     make war needless.\r\n\r\n     Let us take one picture representative of the general features of\r\n     the war--we say nothing of our convictions in regard to the\r\n     conflict. Ulysses S. Grant or Anna Ella Carroll makes plans and\r\n     maps for the campaign; McClellan and Meade are commanded to\r\n     collect the columbiads, muskets and ammunition, and move their\r\n     men to the attack. At the same time the saintly Clara Barton\r\n     collects her cordials, medicines and delicacies, her lint and\r\n     bandages, and, putting them in the ambulance assigned, joins the\r\n     same moving train. McClellan's men meet the enemy, and\r\n     men--brothers--on both sides fall by the death-dealing missiles.\r\n     Miss Barton and her aids bear off the sufferers, staunch their\r\n     bleeding wounds, soothe the reeling brain, bandage the crippled\r\n     limbs, pour in the oil and wine, and make as easy as may be the\r\n     soldier's bed. What a solemn and heartrending farce is here\r\n     enacted! And yet in our present development men and women seek to\r\n     reconcile it with the requirements of religion and the\r\n     necessities of our conflicting lives. So few recognize the\r\n     absolute truth!\r\n\r\n     Mrs. DEVEREUX BLAKE said: _Mr. Chairman, and Gentlemen of the\r\n     Committee_: I come here with your own laws in my hands--and the\r\n     volume is quite a heavy one, too--to ask you whether women are\r\n     citizens of this nation? I find in this book, under the heading\r\n     of the chapter on \"Citizenship,\" the following:\r\n\r\n          Sec. 1,992. All persons born in the United States and not\r\n          subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed,\r\n          are declared to be citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\n     I suppose you will admit that women are, in the language of the\r\n     section, \"persons,\" and that we cannot reasonably be included in\r\n     the class spoken of as \"Indians not taxed.\" Therefore I claim\r\n     that we are \"citizens.\" The same chapter also contains the\r\n     following:\r\n\r\n          Sec. 1,994. Any woman who is now or may hereafter be married\r\n          to a citizen of the United States, and who might herself be\r\n          lawfully naturalized, shall be deemed a citizen.\r\n\r\n     Under this section also we are citizens. I am myself, as indeed\r\n     are most of the ladies present, married to a citizen of the\r\n     United States; so that we are citizens under this count if we\r\n     were not citizens before. Then, further, in the legislation known\r\n     as \"The Civil Rights Bill,\" I find this language:\r\n\r\n          All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States\r\n          shall have the same right, in every State and territory, to\r\n          make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give\r\n          evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and\r\n          proceedings for the security of persons and property as is\r\n          enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like\r\n          punishments, pains, penalties, etc.\r\n\r\n     One would think the logical conclusion from that which I have\r\n     last read would be that _all citizens_ are entitled to equal\r\n     protection everywhere. It appears to mean that. Then I turn to\r\n     another piece of legislation--that which is known as \"The\r\n     Enforcement Act\"--one which some of you, gentlemen, did not like\r\n     very much when it was enacted--and there I find another\r\n     declaration on the same question. The act is entitled \"An Act to\r\n     Enforce the Right of Citizens of the United States to Vote in the\r\n     Several States of this Union, and for other purposes.\" The right\r\n     of \"citizens\" to vote appears to be conceded by this act. In the\r\n     second section it says:\r\n\r\n          It shall be the duty of every such person and officer to\r\n          give to all citizens of the United States the same and equal\r\n          opportunity to perform such prerequisite, and to become\r\n          qualified to vote, without distinction of race, color or\r\n          previous condition of servitude.\r\n\r\n     I ask you, gentlemen of the committee, as lawyers, whether you do\r\n     not think that, after we have been declared to be citizens, we\r\n     have the right to claim the protection of this enforcement act?\r\n     When you gentlemen from the North rise in your places in the\r\n     halls of congress and make these walls ring with your eloquence,\r\n     you are prone to talk a great deal about the right of every\r\n     United States citizen to the ballot, and the necessity of\r\n     protecting every such citizen in its exercise. What do you mean\r\n     by it?\r\n\r\n     It occurs to me here to call your attention to a matter of recent\r\n     occurrence. As you know, there has been a little unpleasantness\r\n     in Maine--a State which is not without a representative among the\r\n     members of the Judiciary Committee--and certain gentlemen there,\r\n     especially Mr. Blaine, have been greatly exercised in their minds\r\n     because, as they allege, the people of Maine have not been\r\n     permitted to express their will at the polls. Why, gentlemen, I\r\n     assert that a majority of the people of Maine have never been\r\n     permitted to express their will at the polls. A majority of the\r\n     people of Maine are women, and from the foundation of this\r\n     government have never exercised any of the inalienable rights of\r\n     citizens. Mr. Blaine made a speech a day or two ago in Augusta.\r\n     He began by reciting the condition of affairs, owing to the\r\n     effort, as he states, \"to substitute a false count for an honest\r\n     ballot,\" and congratulated his audience upon the\r\n     instrumentalities by which they had  triumphed--\r\n\r\n          Without firing a gun, without shedding a drop of blood,\r\n          without striking a single blow, without one disorderly\r\n          assemblage. _The people_ have regained their own right\r\n          through the might and majesty of their own laws.\r\n\r\n     He goes on in this vein to speak of those whom he calls \"the\r\n     people of Maine.\" Well, gentlemen, I do not think you will deny\r\n     that _women are people_. It appears to me that what Mr. Blaine\r\n     said in that connection was nonsense, unless indeed he forgot\r\n     that there were any others than men among the people of the State\r\n     of Maine. I don't suppose that you, gentlemen, are often so\r\n     forgetful. Mr. Blaine said further:\r\n\r\n          The Republicans of Maine and throughout the land felt that\r\n          they were not merely fighting the battle of a single year,\r\n          but for all the future of the State; not merely fighting the\r\n          battle of our own State alone, but for all the States that\r\n          are attempting the great problem of State government\r\n          throughout the world. The corruption or destruction of the\r\n          ballot is a crime against free government, and when\r\n          successful is a subversion of free government.\r\n\r\n     Does that mean the ballot _for men only_ or the ballot _for the\r\n     people_, men and women too? If it is to be received as meaning\r\n     anything, it ought to mean not for one sex alone, but for both.\r\n     Mr. Lincoln declared, in one of his noblest utterances, that no\r\n     man was good enough to govern another man without that man's\r\n     consent. Of course he meant it in its broadest terms; he meant\r\n     that no man or woman was good enough to govern another man or\r\n     woman without that other man's or woman's consent.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Blaine, on another occasion, in connection with the same\r\n     subject-matter, had much to say of the enormity of the oppression\r\n     practiced by his political opponents in depriving the town of\r\n     Portland of the right of representation in view of its paying\r\n     such heavy taxes as it does pay. He expressed the greatest\r\n     indignation at the attempt, forgetting utterly that great body of\r\n     women who pay taxes but are deprived of the right of\r\n     representation. In this connection it may be pertinent for me to\r\n     express the hope, by way of a suggestion, that hereafter, when\r\n     making your speeches, you will not use the term \"citizens\" in a\r\n     broad sense, unless you mean to include women as well as men, and\r\n     that when you do not mean to include women you will speak of male\r\n     citizens as a separate class, because the term, in its general\r\n     application, is illogical and its meaning obscure if not\r\n     self-contradictory.\r\n\r\n     President Hayes was so pleased with one of the sentences in his\r\n     message of a year ago that in his message of this year he has\r\n     reiterated it. It reads thus:\r\n\r\n          That no temporary or administrative interests of government\r\n          will ever displace the zeal of our people in defense of the\r\n          primary rights of citizenship, and that the power of public\r\n          opinion will override all political prejudices and all\r\n          sectional and State attachments in demanding that all over\r\n          our wide territory the name and character of citizen of the\r\n          United States shall mean one and the same thing and carry\r\n          with them unchallenged security and respect.\r\n\r\n     Let me suggest what he ought to have said unless he intended to\r\n     include women, although I am afraid that Mr. Hayes, when he wrote\r\n     this, forgot that there were women in the United States,\r\n     notwithstanding that his excellent wife, perhaps, stood by his\r\n     side. He ought to have said:\r\n\r\n          An act having been passed to enforce the rights of _male_\r\n          citizens to vote, the true vigor of _half_ the population is\r\n          thus expressed, and no interests of government will ever\r\n          displace the zeal of _half_ of our people in defense of the\r\n          primary rights of our _male_ citizens. _The prosperity of\r\n          the States depends upon the protection afforded to our male\r\n          citizens_; and the name and character of _male_ citizens of\r\n          the United States shall mean one and the same thing and\r\n          carry with them unchallenged security and respect.\r\n\r\n     If Mr. Hayes had thus expressed himself, he would have made a\r\n     perfectly logical and clear statement. Gentlemen, I hope that\r\n     hereafter, when speaking or voting in behalf of the citizens of\r\n     the United States, you will bear this in mind and will remember\r\n     that women are citizens as well as men, and that they claim the\r\n     same rights.\r\n\r\n     This question of woman suffrage cannot much longer be ignored. In\r\n     the State from which I come, although we have not a right to\r\n     vote, we are confident that the influence which women brought to\r\n     bear in determining the result of the election last fall had\r\n     something to do with sending into retirement a Democratic\r\n     governor who was opposed to our reform, and electing a\r\n     Republican who was in favor of it. Recollect, gentlemen, that the\r\n     expenditure of time and money which has been made in this cause\r\n     will not be without its effect. The time is coming when the\r\n     demand of an immense number of the women of this country cannot\r\n     be ignored. When you see these representatives coming from all\r\n     the States of the Union to ask for this right, can you doubt\r\n     that, some day, they will succeed in their mission? We do not\r\n     stand before you to plead as beggars; we ask for that which is\r\n     our right. We ask it as due to the memory of our ancestors, who\r\n     fought for the freedom of this country just as bravely as did\r\n     yours. We ask it on many considerations. Why, gentlemen, the very\r\n     furniture here, the carpet on this floor, was paid for with our\r\n     money. We are taxed equally with the men to defray the expenses\r\n     of this congress, and we have a right equally with them to\r\n     participate in the government.\r\n\r\n     In closing, I have only to ask, is there no man here present who\r\n     appreciates the emergencies of this hour? Is there no one among\r\n     you who will rise on the floor of congress as the champion of\r\n     this unrepresented half of the people of the United States? The\r\n     time is not far distant when we shall have our liberties, and the\r\n     politician who can now understand the importance of our cause,\r\n     the statesman who can now see, and will now appreciate the\r\n     justice of it, that man, if true to himself, will write his name\r\n     high on the scroll of fame beside those of the men who have been\r\n     the saviors of the country. Gentlemen I entreat you not to let\r\n     this hearing go by without giving due weight to all that we have\r\n     said. You can no more stay the onward current of this reform than\r\n     you can fight against the stars in their courses.\r\n\r\n     Mr. WILLITS of Michigan: _Mr. Chairman_: I would like to make a\r\n     suggestion here. The regulation amendment, as it has heretofore\r\n     been submitted, provided that the right of citizens of the United\r\n     States to vote should not be abridged on account of sex. I notice\r\n     that the amendment which the ladies here now propose has prefixed\r\n     to it this phrase: \"The right of suffrage in the United States\r\n     shall be based on citizenship.\" I call attention to this because\r\n     I would like to have them explain as fully as they may why they\r\n     incorporate the phrase, \"shall be based on citizenship.\" Is the\r\n     meaning this, that all citizens shall have the right to vote, or\r\n     simply that citizenship shall be the basis of suffrage? The\r\n     words, \"or for any reason not applicable to all citizens of the\r\n     United States,\" also seem to require explanation. The proposition\r\n     in the form in which it is now submitted, I understand, covers a\r\n     little more than has been covered by the amendment submitted in\r\n     previous years.\r\n\r\n     SARA A. SPENCER of Washington, D. C.: If the committee will\r\n     permit me, I will say that the amendment in its present form is\r\n     the concentrated wish of the women of the United States. The\r\n     women of the country sent to congress petitions asking for three\r\n     different forms of constitutional amendment, and when preparing\r\n     the one now before the committee these three were concentrated in\r\n     the one now before you (identical with that of the resolution\r\n     offered in the House by Hon. George B. Loring and by Hon. T. W.\r\n     Ferry in the Senate), omitting, at the request of each of the\r\n     three classes of petitioners, all phrases which were regarded by\r\n     any of them as objectionable. The amendment as now presented is\r\n     therefore the combined wish of the women of the country, viz.,\r\n     that citizenship in the United States shall mean suffrage, and\r\n     that no one shall be deprived of the right to vote for reasons\r\n     not equally applicable to all citizens.\r\n\r\n     MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE said: It is necessary to refer to a\r\n     remarkable decision of the Supreme Court. The case of Virginia L.\r\n     Minor, claiming the right to vote under the fourteenth amendment,\r\n     was argued before the Supreme Court of the United States, October\r\n     term, 1874; decision rendered adversely by Chief-Justice Waite,\r\n     March, 1875, upon the ground that \"the United States had no\r\n     voters in the States of its own creation.\" This was a most\r\n     amazing decision to emanate from the highest judicial authority\r\n     of the nation, and is but another proof how fully that body is\r\n     under the influence of the dominant political party.\r\n\r\n     Contrary to this decision, I unhesitatingly affirm that the\r\n     United States has possessed voters in States of its own creation\r\n     from the very date of the constitution. In Article I, Sec. 2, the\r\n     constitution provides that\r\n\r\n          The House of Representatives shall be composed of members\r\n          chosen every second year by the people of the several\r\n          States, and the electors in each State shall have the\r\n          qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous\r\n          branch of the State legislature.\r\n\r\n     The persons so designated are voters under State laws; but by\r\n     this section of the national constitution they are made United\r\n     States voters. It is directed under what conditions of State\r\n     qualification they may cast votes in their respective States for\r\n     members of the lower house of congress. The constitution here\r\n     created a class of United States voters by adoption of an already\r\n     voting class. Did but this single instance exist, it would be\r\n     sufficient to nullify Chief-Justice Waite's decision, as Article\r\n     VI, Sec. 2, declares\r\n\r\n          The constitution and the laws of the United States which\r\n          shall be made in pursuance thereof * * * shall be the\r\n          supreme law of the land.\r\n\r\n     This supreme law at its very inception created a class of United\r\n     States voters. If in the Minor case alone, the premises of the\r\n     Supreme Court and Chief-Justice Waite were wrong, the decision\r\n     possesses no legal value; but in addition to this class, the\r\n     United States, by special laws and amendments has from time to\r\n     time created other classes of United States voters.\r\n\r\n     Under the naturalization laws citizenship is recognized as the\r\n     basis of suffrage. No State can admit a foreigner to the right of\r\n     the ballot, even under United States laws, unless he is already a\r\n     citizen, or has formally declared his intention of becoming a\r\n     citizen of the United States. The creation of the right here is\r\n     national; its regulation, local.\r\n\r\n     Men who commit crimes against the civil laws of the United States\r\n     forfeit their rights of citizenship. State law cannot\r\n     re-habilitate them, but within the last five years 2,500 such men\r\n     have been pardoned by congressional enactment, and thus again\r\n     been made voters in States by United States law. Is it not\r\n     strange that with a knowledge of these facts before him\r\n     Chief-Justice Waite could base his decision against the right of\r\n     a woman to the ballot, on the ground that the United States had\r\n     no voters in the States of its own creation?\r\n\r\n     Criminals against the military law of the United States, who\r\n     receive pardon, are still another class of voters thus created. A\r\n     very large body of men, several hundred thousand, forfeited their\r\n     rights of citizenship, their ballot, by participation in the\r\n     rebellion; they were political criminals. When general amnesty\r\n     was proclaimed they again secured the ballot. They had been\r\n     deprived of the suffrage by United States law and it was restored\r\n     to them by the same law.\r\n\r\n     It may be replied that the rebellious States had been reduced to\r\n     the condition of territories, over whose suffrage the general\r\n     government had control. But let me ask why, then, a large class\r\n     of men remained disfranchised after these States again took up\r\n     local government? A large class of men were especially exempted\r\n     from general amnesty and for the restoration of their political\r\n     rights were obliged to individually petition congress for the\r\n     removal of their political disabilities, and these men then\r\n     became \"voters in States,\" by action of the United States. Here,\r\n     again, the United States recognized citizenship and suffrage as\r\n     synonymous. If the United States has no voters of its own\r\n     creation in the States, what are these men? A few, the leaders in\r\n     the rebellion, are yet disfranchised, and no State has power to\r\n     change this condition. Only the United States can again make them\r\n     voters in States.\r\n\r\n     Under the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments the colored men of\r\n     the South, who never had possessed the ballot, and those colored\r\n     men of the North over whom some special disqualification hung,\r\n     were alike made voters by United States law. It required no\r\n     action of Delaware, Indiana, New York, or any of those States in\r\n     which the colored man was not upon voting equality with the white\r\n     men, to change their constitutions or statutes in order to do\r\n     away with such disqualifications. The fourteenth amendment\r\n     created another class of United States voters in States, to the\r\n     number of a million or more. The fourteenth amendment, and the\r\n     act of congress to enforce it, were at once recognized to be\r\n     superior to State law--abrogating and repealing State\r\n     constitutions and State laws contradictory to its provisions.\r\n\r\n     By an act of congress March 3, and a presidential proclamation of\r\n     March 11, 1865, all deserters who failed to report themselves to\r\n     a provost marshall within sixty days, forfeited their rights of\r\n     citizenship as an additional penalty for the crime of desertion,\r\n     thus losing their ballot without possibility of its restoration\r\n     except by an act of congress. Whenever this may be done\r\n     collectively or individually, these men will become State voters\r\n     by and through the United States law.\r\n\r\n     As proving the sophistry used by legal minds in order to hide\r\n     from themselves and the world the fact that the United States has\r\n     power over the ballot in States, mention may be made of a case\r\n     which, in 1866, came before Justice Strong, then a member of the\r\n     Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, but since a justice of the Supreme\r\n     Court of the United States. For sophistical reasoning it is a\r\n     curiosity in legal decisions. One point made by Judge Strong was,\r\n     that congress may deprive a citizen of the opportunity to enjoy\r\n     a right belonging to him as a citizen of a State even the right\r\n     of voting, but cannot deprive him of the right itself. This is on\r\n     a par with saying that congress may deprive a citizen of the\r\n     opportunity to enjoy a right belonging to him as an individual,\r\n     even the right of life, but cannot deprive him of life itself.\r\n\r\n     A still more remarkable class of United States voters than any\r\n     yet mentioned, exists. Soon after the close of the war congress\r\n     enacted a law that foreigners having served in the civil war and\r\n     been honorably discharged from the army, should be allowed to\r\n     vote. And this, too, without the announcement of their intention\r\n     of becoming citizens of the republic. A class of United States\r\n     voters were thus created out of a class of non-citizens.\r\n\r\n     I have mentioned eight classes of United States voters, and yet\r\n     not one of the States has been deprived of the powers necessary\r\n     to local self-government. To States belong all matters of\r\n     strictly local interest, such as the incorporation of towns and\r\n     cities, the settlement of county and other boundaries; laws of\r\n     marriage, divorce, protection of life and property, etc. It has\r\n     been said, the ordaining and establishment of a constitution for\r\n     the government of a State is always the act of a State in its\r\n     highest sovereign capacity, but if any question as to nationality\r\n     ever existed, it was settled by the war. Even State constitutions\r\n     were found unable to stand when in conflict with a law of the\r\n     United States or an amendment to its constitution. All are bound\r\n     by the authority of the nation.\r\n\r\n     This theory of State sovereignty must have a word. When the Union\r\n     was formed several of the States did not even frame a\r\n     constitution. It was in 1818 that Connecticut adopted her first\r\n     State constitution. Rhode Island had no constitution until 1842.\r\n     Prior to these years the government of these States was\r\n     administered under the authority of royal charters brought out\r\n     from England.\r\n\r\n     Where was their State sovereignty? The rights even of suffrage\r\n     enjoyed by citizens of these States during these respective\r\n     periods of forty-two and sixty-six years, were either secured\r\n     them by monarchial England or republican United States. If by the\r\n     latter all voters in these two States during these years were\r\n     United States voters. It is a historical fact that no State save\r\n     Texas was ever for an hour sovereign or independent. The\r\n     experience of the country proves there is but one real\r\n     sovereignty. It has been said, with truth,\r\n\r\n          There is but one sovereign State on the American continent\r\n          known to international or constitutional law, and that is\r\n          the republic itself. This forms the United States and should\r\n          be so called.\r\n\r\n     I ask for a sixteenth amendment because this republic is a nation\r\n     and not a confederacy of States. I ask it because the United\r\n     States not only possesses inherent power to protect its citizens\r\n     but also because of its national duty to secure to all its\r\n     citizens the exercise of their rights of self-government. I ask\r\n     it because having created classes of voters in numberless\r\n     instances, it is most flagrant injustice to deny this protection\r\n     to woman. I ask it because the Nation and not the State is\r\n     supreme.\r\n\r\n     PHOEBE W. COUZINS of Missouri, to whom had been assigned the\r\n     next thirty minutes, said: _Mr. Chairman, and Gentlemen of the\r\n     Judiciary Committee_: I am invited to speak of the dangers which\r\n     beset us at this hour in the decision of the Supreme Court of the\r\n     United States in Mrs. Minor's case, which not only stultifies its\r\n     previous interpretation of the recent constitutional amendments\r\n     and makes them a dead letter, but will rank, in the coming ages,\r\n     in the history of the judiciary, with the Dred Scott decision.\r\n     The law, as explained in the Dred Scott case, was an infamous\r\n     one, which trampled upon the most solemn rights of the loyal\r\n     citizens of the government, and declared the constitution to mean\r\n     anything or nothing, as the case might be. Yet the decision in\r\n     that case had a saving clause, for it was not the unanimous voice\r\n     of a Democratic judiciary. Dissenting opinions were nobly uttered\r\n     from the bench. In the more recent case, under the rule of a\r\n     Republican judiciary created by a party professing to be one of\r\n     justice, the rights of one-half of the people were deliberately\r\n     abrogated without a dissenting voice. This violation of the\r\n     fundamental principles of our government called forth no protest.\r\n     In all of the decisions against woman in the Republican court,\r\n     there has not been found one Lord Mansfield, who, rising to the\r\n     supreme height of an unbiased judgment, would give the immortal\r\n     decree that shall crown with regal dignity the mother of the\r\n     race: \"I care not for the dictates of judges, however eminent, if\r\n     they be contrary to principle. If the parties will have judgment,\r\n     let justice be done, though the heavens fall.\"\r\n\r\n     The Dred Scott decision declared as the law of citizenship, \"to\r\n     be a citizen is to have actual possession and enjoyment, or the\r\n     perfect right to the acquisition and enjoyment of an entire\r\n     equality of privileges, civil and political.\" But the slave-power\r\n     was then dominant and the court decided that a black man was not\r\n     a citizen because he had not the right to vote. But when the\r\n     constitution was so amended as to make \"all persons born or\r\n     naturalized in the United States citizens thereof,\" a negro, by\r\n     virtue of his United States citizenship, was declared, under the\r\n     amendments, a voter in every State in the Union. And the Supreme\r\n     Court reaffirmed this right in the celebrated slaughter-house\r\n     cases (16 Wallace, 71). It said, \"The negro, having by the\r\n     fourteenth amendment, been declared to be a citizen of the United\r\n     States, is thus made a voter in every State in the Union.\"\r\n\r\n     But when the loyal women of Missouri, apprehending that \"all\r\n     persons beneath the flag were made citizens and voters by the\r\n     fourteenth amendment,\" through Mrs. Minor, applied to the Supreme\r\n     Court for protection in the exercise of that same right, this\r\n     high tribunal, reversing all its former decisions, proclaims\r\n     State sovereignty superior to national authority. This it does in\r\n     this strange language: \"Being born in the United States, a woman\r\n     is a person and therefore a citizen\"--we are much obliged to them\r\n     for that definition of our identity as persons--\"but the\r\n     constitution of the United States does not confer the right of\r\n     suffrage upon any one.\" And then, in the face of its previous\r\n     decisions, the court declared: \"The United States has no voters\r\n     in the States of its own creation\", that the elective officers of\r\n     the United States are all elected, directly or indirectly by\r\n     State voters. It remands woman to the States for her protection,\r\n     thus giving to the State the supreme authority and overthrowing\r\n     the entire results of the war, which was fought to maintain\r\n     national supremacy over any and all subjects in which the rights\r\n     and privileges of the citizens of the United States are involved.\r\n\r\n     No supreme allegiance, gentlemen of the committee, can be claimed\r\n     for or by a government, if it has no citizens of its own\r\n     creation, and constitutional amendments cannot confer authority\r\n     over matters which have no existence in the constitution. Thus,\r\n     our supreme law-givers hold themselves up for obloquy and\r\n     ridicule in their interpretation of the most solemn rights of\r\n     loyal citizens, and make our constitutional law to mean anything\r\n     or nothing as the case may be. You will see, gentlemen, that the\r\n     very point which the South contended for as the true one is here\r\n     acknowledged to be the true one by the Supreme Court--that of\r\n     State rights superior to national authority. The whole of the\r\n     recent contest hinged upon this. The appeal to arms and the\r\n     constitutional amendments were to establish the subordination of\r\n     the State to national supremacy, to maintain the national\r\n     authority over any and all subjects in which the rights and\r\n     privileges of the citizens of the United States were involved;\r\n     but this decision in Mrs. Minor's case completely nullifies the\r\n     supreme authority of the government, and gives the States more\r\n     than has hitherto been claimed for them by the advocates of State\r\n     rights. The subject of the franchise is thus wholly withdrawn\r\n     from federal supervision and control. If \"the United States has\r\n     no citizens of its own creation,\" of course no supreme allegiance\r\n     can be claimed over the various citizens of the States.\r\n\r\n     The constitutional amendments cannot confer authority over a\r\n     matter which has no existence in the constitution. If it has no\r\n     voters, it can have nothing whatever to do with the elections and\r\n     voting in the States; yet the United States invaded the State of\r\n     New York, sent its officers there to try, convict, and sentence\r\n     Miss Anthony for exercising a right in her own State which they\r\n     declared the United States had no jurisdiction over. They send\r\n     United States troops into the South to protect the negro in his\r\n     right to vote, and then declare they have no jurisdiction over\r\n     his voting. Then, mark the grave results which may and can follow\r\n     this decision and legislation. I do not imagine that the Supreme\r\n     Court, in its cowardly dodging of woman's right to all the rights\r\n     and privileges which citizenship involves, designed to completely\r\n     abrogate the principles established by the recent contest, or to\r\n     nullify the ensuing legislation on the subject. But it certainly\r\n     has done all this; for it must logically follow that if the\r\n     United States has no citizens, it cannot legislate upon the\r\n     rights of citizens, and the recent amendments are devoid of\r\n     authority. It has well been suggested by Mr. Minor, in his\r\n     criticism of the decision, that if members of the House of\r\n     Representatives are elected by _State_ voters, as the Supreme\r\n     Court has declared, there is no reason why States may not refuse\r\n     to elect them as in 1860, and thus deprive congress of its power.\r\n     And if a sufficient number could be united to recall at their\r\n     pleasure these representatives, what authority has the federal\r\n     government, under this decision, for coercing them into\r\n     subjection or refusing them a separation, if all these voters in\r\n     the States desired an independent existence? None whatever. Mr.\r\n     Garfield, in the House, in his speech last March, calls attention\r\n     to this subject, but does not allude to the fact that the Supreme\r\n     Court has already opened the door. He says:\r\n\r\n          There are several ways in which our government may be\r\n          annihilated without the firing of a gun. For example,\r\n          suppose the people of the United States should say, we will\r\n          elect no representatives to congress. Of course this is a\r\n          violent supposition; but suppose that they do not. Is there\r\n          any remedy? Does our constitution provide any remedy\r\n          whatever? In two years there would be no House of\r\n          Representatives; of course, no support of the government and\r\n          no government. Suppose, again, the States should say,\r\n          through their legislatures, we will elect no senators. Such\r\n          abstention alone would absolutely destroy this government;\r\n          and our system provides no process of compulsion to prevent\r\n          it. Again, suppose the two houses were to assemble in their\r\n          usual order, and a majority of one in this body or in the\r\n          Senate should firmly band themselves together and say, we\r\n          will vote to adjourn the moment the hour of meeting arrives,\r\n          and continue so to vote at every session during our two\r\n          years of existence--the government would perish, and there\r\n          is no provision of the constitution to prevent it.\r\n\r\n     The States may inform their representatives that they can do\r\n     this; and, under this position, they have the power and the right\r\n     so to do.\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen, we are now on the verge of one of the most important\r\n     presidential campaigns. The party in power holds its reins by a\r\n     very uncertain tenure. If the decision shall favor the one which\r\n     has been on the anxious bench for lo! these twenty years, and in\r\n     probation until hope has well-nigh departed, what may be its\r\n     action if invested again with the control of the destinies of\r\n     this nation? The next party in power may inquire, and answer, by\r\n     what right and how far the Southern States are bound by the\r\n     legislation in which they had no part or consent. And if the\r\n     Supreme Court of a Republican judiciary now declares, _after_ the\r\n     war, _after_ the constitutional amendments, that federal suffrage\r\n     does not exist and never had an existence in the constitution, it\r\n     follows that the South has the right to regulate and control all\r\n     of the questions arising upon suffrage in the several States\r\n     without any interference on the part of an authority which\r\n     declares it has no jurisdiction. An able writer has said:\r\n\r\n          All injustice at last works out a loss. The great ledger of\r\n          nations does not report a good balance for injustice. It has\r\n          always met fearful losses. The irrepealable law of justice\r\n          will, sooner or later, grind a nation to powder if it fail\r\n          to establish that equilibrium of allegiance and protection\r\n          which is the essential end of all government. Woe to that\r\n          nation which thinks lightly of the duties it owes to its\r\n          citizens and imagines that governments are not bound by\r\n          moral laws.\r\n\r\n     It was the tax on tea--woman's drink prerogative--which\r\n     precipitated the rebellion of 1776. To allay the irritation of\r\n     the colonies, all taxes were rescinded save that on tea, which\r\n     was left to indicate King George's dominion. But our\r\n     revolutionary fathers and mothers said, \"No; the tax is paltry,\r\n     but the principle is great\"; and Eve, as usual, pointed the moral\r\n     for Adam's benefit. A most suggestive picture, one which aroused\r\n     the intensest patriotism of the colonies, was that of a woman\r\n     pinioned by her arms to the ground by a British peer, with a\r\n     British red-coat holding her with one hand and with the other\r\n     forcibly thrusting down her throat the contents of a tea-pot,\r\n     which she heroically spewed back in his face; while the figure of\r\n     Justice, in the distance, wept over this prostrate Liberty. Now,\r\n     gentlemen, we might well adopt a similar representation. Here is\r\n     Miss Smith of Glastonbury, Conn., whose cows have been sold every\r\n     year by the government, contending for the same principle as our\r\n     forefathers--that of resistance to taxation without\r\n     representation. We might have a picture of a cow, with an\r\n     American tax-collector at the horns, a foreign-born assessor at\r\n     the heels, forcibly selling the birthright of an American\r\n     citizen, while Julia and Abby Smith, in the background, with\r\n     veiled faces, weep over the degeneracy of Republican leadership.\r\n\r\n     But there are those in authority in the government who do not\r\n     believe in this decision by the Supreme Court of the United\r\n     States. The attorney-general, in his instructions to the United\r\n     States marshals and their deputies or assistants in the Southern\r\n     States, when speaking of the countenance and support of all good\r\n     citizens of the United States in the respective districts of the\r\n     marshals, remarks:\r\n\r\n          It is not necessary to say that it is upon such countenance\r\n          and support that the United States mainly rely in their\r\n          endeavor to enforce the right to vote which they have given\r\n          or have secured.\r\n\r\n     You notice the phraseology. Again, he says:\r\n\r\n          The laws of the United States are supreme, and so,\r\n          consequently, is the action of officials of the United\r\n          States in enforcing them.\r\n\r\n     Secretary Sherman said in his speech at Steubenville, July 6:\r\n\r\n          The negroes are free and are citizens and voters. That, at\r\n          least, is a part of the constitution and cannot be changed.\r\n\r\n     And President Hayes in his two last messages, as Mrs. Blake\r\n     recited to you, has declared  that--\r\n\r\n          United States citizenship shall mean one and the same thing\r\n          and carry with it all over our wide territory unchallenged\r\n          security and respect.\r\n\r\n     And that is what we ask for women.\r\n\r\n     In conclusion, gentlemen, I say to you that a sense of justice is\r\n     the sovereign power of the human mind, the most unyielding of\r\n     any; it rewards with a higher sanction, it punishes with a deeper\r\n     agony than any earthly tribunal. It never slumbers, never dies.\r\n     It constantly utters and demands justice by the eternal rule of\r\n     right, truth and equity. And on these eternal foundation-stones\r\n     we stand.\r\n\r\n     Crowning the dome of this great building there stands the\r\n     majestic figure of a woman representing Liberty. It was no\r\n     idealistic thought or accident of vision which gave us Liberty\r\n     prefigured by a woman. It is the great soul of the universe\r\n     pointing the final revelation yet to come to humanity, the\r\n     prophecy of the ages--the last to be first.[59]\r\n\r\nWhen the proposition to print these speeches came before the House\r\na prolonged debate against it showed the readiness of the\r\nopposition to avail themselves of every legal technicality to\r\ndeprive women of equal rights and privileges. But the measure\r\nfinally passed and the documents were printed. To the Hon. Elbridge\r\nG. Lapham of New York we were largely indebted for the success of\r\nthis measure.\r\n\r\nThe Washington _Republican_ of February 6, 1880, describes a novel\r\nevent that took place at that time:\r\n\r\n     In the Supreme Court of the United States, on Monday, on motion\r\n     of Mrs. Belva Lockwood, Samuel R. Lowry of Alabama was admitted\r\n     to practice. Mr. Lowry is president of the Huntsville, Ala.,\r\n     industrial school, and a gentleman of high attainments. It was\r\n     quite fitting that the first woman admitted to practice before\r\n     this court should move the admission of the first Southern\r\n     colored man. Both will doubtless make good records as\r\n     representatives of their respective classes. This scene was\r\n     characterized by George W. Julian as one of the most impressive\r\n     he ever witnessed--a fitting subject for an historical painting.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, women were for the first time appointed census\r\nenumerators. Gen. Francis Walker, head of that department, said\r\nthere was no legal obstacle to the appointment of women as\r\nenumerators, and he would gladly confirm the nomination of suitable\r\ncandidates. Very different was the action of the head of the\r\npost-office department, who refused, on the ground of sex, the\r\napplication of 500 women for appointment as letter-carriers.\r\n\r\nIn view of the important work to be done in a presidential\r\ncampaign, the National Association decided to issue an appeal to\r\nthe women of the country to appoint delegates from each State and\r\nterritory, and prepare an address to each of the presidential\r\nnominating conventions. In Washington a move was made for an act of\r\nincorporation in order that the Association might legally receive\r\nbequests. Tracts containing a general statement of the status of\r\nthe movement were mailed to all members of congress and officers of\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Committee on Rules, Mr. Randall, a Democratic\r\nmember of Pennsylvania, and Mr. Garfield, a Republican member of\r\nOhio, reminded Mr. Frye of Maine that he had been instructed by\r\nthat committee, nearly a year before, to present to the House a\r\nresolution on the rights of women. The _Congressional Record_ of\r\nMarch 27 contains the following:\r\n\r\n     Mr. FRYE: I am instructed by the Committee on Rules to report a\r\n     resolution providing for the appointment of a special committee\r\n     on the political rights of women, and to move that it be placed\r\n     on the House calendar.\r\n\r\n     Mr. CONGER: Let it be read.\r\n\r\n     The clerk read the resolution as follows:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved by the House of Representatives_, That the speaker\r\n          appoint a special committee of nine members, to whom shall\r\n          be referred all memorials, petitions, bills and resolutions\r\n          relating to the rights of the women of the United States,\r\n          with power to hear the same and report thereon by bill or\r\n          otherwise. The resolution was referred to the House\r\n          calendar.\r\n\r\nThis was a proof of the advancing status of our question that both\r\nRepublican and Democratic leaders regarded the \"rights of women\"\r\nworthy the consideration of a special committee.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1880, the National Association held a series of\r\nmass meetings in the States of Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and\r\nMichigan, commencing with the May anniversary in Indianapolis, at\r\nwhich sixteen States were represented.[60] The convention was held\r\nin Park Theatre, Miss Anthony presiding. The arrangements devolved\r\nchiefly on Mrs. May Wright Thompson, who discharged her\r\nresponsibilities in a most praiseworthy manner, providing\r\nentertainment for the speakers, and paying all the expenses from\r\nthe treasury of the local association. A series of resolutions was\r\npresented, discussed by a large number of the delegates, and\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the plan decided upon in Washington of attending\r\nall the nominating conventions, the next meeting was held in\r\nChicago, beginning on the same day with the Republican convention.\r\nFarwell Hall was filled at an early hour; Miss Anthony in the\r\nchair. A large number of delegates[61] were present from every\r\npart of the Union, among whom were many of the most distinguished\r\nadvocates of woman suffrage. Mrs. Harbert gave an eloquent address\r\nof welcome.\r\n\r\nCommittees were appointed to visit the delegates from the different\r\nStates to the Republican convention, to secure seats for the\r\nmembers of the National Association, and to ask that a plank\r\nrecommending a sixteenth amendment be incorporated in the platform\r\nadopted by the Republican party. The proprietor of the Palmer House\r\ngave the use of a large parlor to the Association for business\r\nmeetings and the reception of Republican delegates, many of whom\r\nwere in favor of a woman's plank in their platform, and of giving\r\nthe ladies seats in the convention. Strenuous efforts had been made\r\nto this end. One hundred and eighteen senators and representatives\r\naddressed a letter to the chairman of the National Republican\r\ncommittee--Don Cameron--asking that seventy-six seats should be\r\ngiven in the convention to the representatives of the National\r\nWoman Suffrage Association. It would naturally be deemed that a\r\nrequest, proceeding from such a source, would be heeded. The men\r\nwho made it were holding the highest positions in the body politic;\r\nbut the party managers presumed to disregard this request, and also\r\nthe vote of the committee. The question of furnishing seats for our\r\ndelegates was brought up before the close of their deliberations by\r\nMr. Finnell, of Kentucky, who said:\r\n\r\n     A committee of women have been here and they ask for seventy-six\r\n     seats in this convention. I move that they be furnished.\r\n\r\nMr. Cary of Wyoming, made some remarks showing that woman suffrage\r\nin his territory had been to the advantage of the Republican party,\r\nand seconded the motion of Mr. Finnell, which was adopted. The\r\nfollowing resolution of the Arkansas delegation to the National\r\nRepublican convention was read and received with enthusiasm:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we pledge ourselves to secure to women the\r\n     exercise of their right to vote.\r\n\r\nIt is here to be noted that not only were the Arkansas delegation\r\nof Republicans favorable to the recognition of woman suffrage in\r\nthe platform of that party, but that the Southern delegates were\r\nlargely united in that demand. Mr. New told the ladies that the\r\nGrant men had voted as a unit in favor of the women, while the\r\nBlaine and Sherman men unanimously voted against them.\r\n\r\nBut the ladies, well knowing the uncertainty of politicians, were\r\nsoon upon the way to the committee-room, to secure positive\r\nassurance from the lips of the chairman himself--Don Cameron of\r\nPennsylvania--that such tickets should be forthcoming, when they\r\nwere stopped by a messenger hurrying after them to announce the\r\npresence of the secretary of the committee, Hon. John New, at their\r\nheadquarters, in the grand parlor of the Palmer House, with a\r\ncommunication in regard to the tickets. He said the seventy-six\r\nseats voted by the committee had been reduced to _ten_ by its\r\nchairman, and these ten were not offered to the Association in its\r\nofficial capacity, but as complimentary or \"guest tickets,\" for a\r\nseat on the platform back of the presiding officers.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Resolutions, popularly known as the platform\r\ncommittee, held a meeting in the Palmer House, June 2, to which\r\nBelva A. Lockwood obtained admission. On motion of Mr. Fredley of\r\nIndiana, Mrs. Lockwood was given permission to present the memorial\r\nof the National Woman Suffrage Association to the Republican party.\r\n\r\n     _To the Republican Party in Convention assembled, Chicago, June\r\n     2, 1880_:\r\n\r\n     Seventy-six delegates from local, State and National suffrage\r\n     associations, representing every section of the United States,\r\n     are here to-day to ask you to place the following plank in your\r\n     platform:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That we pledge ourselves to secure to women the\r\n          exercise of their right to vote.\r\n\r\n     We ask you to pledge yourselves to protect the rights of one-half\r\n     of the American people, and to thus carry your own principles to\r\n     their logical results. The thirteenth amendment of 1865,\r\n     abolishing slavery, the fourteenth of 1867, defining citizenship,\r\n     and the fifteenth of 1870, securing United States citizens in\r\n     their right to vote, and your prolonged and powerful debates on\r\n     all the great issues involved in our civil conflict, stand as\r\n     enduring monuments to the honor of the Republican party. Impelled\r\n     by the ever growing demand among women for a voice in the laws\r\n     they are required to obey, for their rightful share in the\r\n     government of this republic, various State legislatures have\r\n     conceded partial suffrage. But the great duty remains of securing\r\n     to woman her right to have her opinions on all questions counted\r\n     at the ballot-box.\r\n\r\n     You cannot live on the noble words and deeds of those who\r\n     inaugurated the Republican party. You should vie with those men\r\n     in great achievements. Progress is the law of national life. You\r\n     must have a new, vital issue to rouse once more the enthusiasm of\r\n     the people. Our question of human rights answers this demand. The\r\n     two great political parties are alike divided upon finance,\r\n     free-trade, labor reform and general questions of political\r\n     economy. The essential point in which you differ from the\r\n     Democratic party is national supremacy, and it is on this very\r\n     issue we make our demand, and ask that our rights as United\r\n     States citizens be secured by an amendment to the national\r\n     constitution. To carry this measure is not only your privilege\r\n     but your duty. Your pledge to enfranchise ten millions of women\r\n     will rouse an enthusiasm which must count in the coming closely\r\n     contested election. But above expediency is right, and to do\r\n     justice is ever the highest political wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe committee then adjourned to meet at the Sherman-house club\r\nroom, where they reaessembled at 8 o'clock. Soon after the calling\r\nto order of our own convention in Farwell Hall, word came that a\r\nhearing had been accorded before the platform committee. This\r\nproved to be a sub-committee. Ten minutes were given Miss Anthony\r\nto plead the cause of 10,000,000--yes, 20,000,000 citizens of this\r\nrepublic(?), while, watch in hand, Mr. Pierrepont sat to strike the\r\ngavel when this time expired. Ten minutes!! Twice has the great\r\nRepublican party, in the plentitude of its power, allowed woman\r\n_ten_ minutes to plead her cause before it. Ten minutes twice in\r\nthe past eight years, while all the remainder of the time it has\r\nbeen fighting for power and place and continued life, heedless of\r\nthe wrongs and injustice it was constantly perpetrating towards\r\none-half the people. Ten minutes! What a period in the history of\r\ntime. Small hope remained of a committee, with such a chairman,\r\nintroducing a plank for woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe whole Arkansas delegation had expressed itself in favor; most\r\nof the Kentucky delegation were known to be so, while New York not\r\nonly had friends to woman suffrage among its number, but even an\r\nofficer of the State association was a delegate to the Republican\r\nconvention. These men were called upon, a form of plank placed in\r\ntheir hands and they were asked to offer it as an amendment when\r\nthe committee reported, but that plan was blocked by a motion that\r\nall resolutions should be referred to the committee for action.\r\n\r\nSenator Farr of Michigan, a colored man, was the only member of the\r\nplatform committee who suggested the insertion of a woman suffrage\r\nplank, the Michigan delegation to a man, favoring such action. The\r\ndelegates were ready in case opportunity offered, to present the\r\naddress to the convention. But no such moment arrived.\r\n\r\nThe mass convention had been called for June 2, but the crowds in\r\nthe city gave promise of such extended interest that Farwell Hall\r\nwas engaged for June 1, and before the second day's proceedings\r\nclosed, funds were voluntarily raised by the audience to continue\r\nthe meeting the third day. So vast was the number of letters and\r\npostals addressed to the convention from all parts of the country\r\nfrom women who desired to vote, that the whole time of each session\r\ncould have been spent in reading them--one day's mail alone\r\nbringing letters and postals from twenty-three States and three\r\nterritories. Some of these letters contained hundreds of names,\r\nothers represented town, county, and State societies. Many were\r\naddressed to the different nominating conventions, Republican,\r\nGreenback, Democratic, while the reasons given for desiring to\r\nvote, ranged from the simple demand, through all the scale of\r\nreasons connected with good government and morality. So highly\r\nimportant a contribution to history did the Chicago Historical\r\nSociety[62] deem these expressions of woman's desire to vote, that\r\nit made a formal request to be put in possession of _all_ letters\r\nand postals, with a promise that they should be carefully guarded\r\nin a fire-proof safe.\r\n\r\nAfter the eloquent speeches[63] of the closing session, Miss Alice\r\nS. Mitchell sang Julia Ward Howe's \"Battle Hymn of the Republic,\"\r\nMrs. Harbert playing the accompaniment, and the immense audience of\r\n3,000 people joining in the chorus. This convention held three\r\nsessions each day, and at all except the last an admission fee was\r\ncharged, and yet the hall was densely crowded throughout. For\r\nenthusiasm, nothing ever surpassed these meetings in the history of\r\nthe suffrage movement. A platform and resolution were adopted as\r\nthe voice of the convention.\r\n\r\n     The special object of the National Woman Suffrage Association is\r\n     to secure national protection for women in the exercise of their\r\n     right of suffrage. It recognizes the fact that our government was\r\n     formed on the political basis of the consent of the governed, and\r\n     that the Declaration of Independence struck a blow at every\r\n     existing form by declaring the individual to be the source of all\r\n     power. The members of this association, outside of our great\r\n     question, have diverse political affiliations, but for the\r\n     purpose of gaining this great right to the ballot, its members\r\n     hold their party predilections in abeyance; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That in this year of presidential nominations and\r\n     political campaigns, we announce our determination to support no\r\n     party by whatever name called, unless such party shall, in its\r\n     platform, first emphatically endorse our demand for a recognition\r\n     of the exact and permanent political equality of all citizens.\r\n\r\nA delegation[64] went to the Greenback convention and presented the\r\nfollowing memorial:\r\n\r\n     When a new political party is formed it should be based upon the\r\n     principles of justice to all classes hitherto unrecognized. The\r\n     finance question, as broad as it is, does not reach down to the\r\n     deepest wrong in the nation. Beneath this question lies that of\r\n     the denial of the right of self-government to one-half the\r\n     people. It is impossible to secure the property rights of the\r\n     people without first recognizing their personal rights. More than\r\n     any class of men, woman represents the great unpaid laborer of\r\n     the world--a slave, who, as wife and daughter, absolutely works\r\n     for her board and clothes. The question of finance deeply\r\n     interests woman, but her opinions upon it are valueless while\r\n     deprived of the right of enforcing them at the ballot box. You\r\n     are here in convention assembled, not alone to nominate a\r\n     candidate for president, but also to promulgate your platform of\r\n     principles to the world. Now is your golden opportunity. The\r\n     Republican party presents no vital issue to the country; its\r\n     platform is a repetition of the platitudes of the past twenty\r\n     years. It has ceased to be a party of principles. It lives on the\r\n     past. The deeds of dead men hold it together. Its disregard of\r\n     principles has thrown opportunity into your hands. Will you make\r\n     yourselves the party of the future? Will you recognize woman's\r\n     right of self-government? Will you make woman suffrage an\r\n     underlying principle in your platform? If you will make these\r\n     pledges, the National Association will work for the triumph of\r\n     your party in the approaching closely contested campaign.\r\n\r\nThe ladies were accorded hearings by several delegations previous\r\nto the assembling of the convention. A resolution committee of one\r\nfrom each State was appointed, and each member allowed two minutes\r\nto present either by speech or writing such principles as it\r\nrequested incorporated in the platform. Lucinda B. Chandler, being\r\na Greenbacker on principle, was a regularly elected delegate and by\r\ncourtesy was added to a sub-committee on resolutions. The one\r\nprepared by the National Association was placed in her hands, but,\r\nas she was forbidden to speak upon it, her support could only be\r\ngiven by vote, and a meaningless substitute took its place. The\r\ncourtesy of placing Mrs. Chandler upon the committee was like much\r\nof man's boasted chivalry to woman, a seeming favor at the expense\r\nof right.\r\n\r\nAfter trying in vain for recognition as a political factor from the\r\nRepublican and Greenback nominating conventions the delegates went\r\nto Cincinnati.[65]\r\n\r\nCommittees were at once appointed to visit the different\r\ndelegations. Women were better treated by the Democrats at\r\nCincinnati than by the Republicans at Chicago. A committee-room in\r\nMusic Hall was at once placed at their disposal, placards pointing\r\nto their headquarters were printed by the local committee at its\r\nown expense, and sixteen seats given to the ladies upon the floor\r\nof the house, just back of the regular delegates. A hearing[66]\r\nbefore the platform committee was granted with no limit as to time.\r\nAt the close a delegate approached the table, saying, \"I favor\r\ngiving woman a plank,\" \"So do I,\" replied Mr. Watterson, chairman\r\nof the committee. Many delegates in conversation, favored the\r\nrecognition of woman's political rights, and a large number of the\r\nplatform committee favored the introduction of the following plank:\r\n\r\n     That the Democratic party, recognizing the rapid growth of the\r\n     woman suffrage question, suggests a consideration of this\r\n     important subject by the people in anticipation of the time, near\r\n     at hand, when it must become a political issue.\r\n\r\nBut although the platform committee sat until 2 A.M., no such\r\nresult was reached, in consequence, it was said, of the objection\r\nof the extreme Southern element which feared the political\r\nrecognition of negro women of the South.\r\n\r\nThe delegations from Maine, Kansas and New York were favorable, and\r\noffered the Association the use of their committee-rooms at the\r\nBurnett House and the Grand Hotel whenever desired. Mayor Prince of\r\nBoston not only offered a committee-room but secured seats for the\r\ndelegates on the floor of the house. Mr. Henry Watterson, of the\r\nLouisville _Courier-Journal_, as chairman of the Platform\r\nCommittee, extended every courtesy within his power. Mayor Harrison\r\nof Chicago did his best to secure to the delegates a hearing before\r\nthe convention. He offered to escort Miss Anthony to the platform\r\nthat she might at least present the address. \"You may be\r\nprevented,\" suggested one. \"I'd like to see them do it,\" he\r\nreplied. \"Have I not just brought about a reconciliation between\r\nTammany and the rest of New York?\" Taking Miss Anthony upon his arm\r\nand telling her not to flinch, he made his way to the platform,\r\nwhen the chairman, Hon. Wade Hampton of South Carolina, politely\r\noffered her a seat, and ordered the clerk to read the address:\r\n\r\n     _To the Democratic Party in Nominating Convention Assembled,\r\n     Cincinnati, June 22, 1880:_\r\n\r\n     On behalf of the women of the country we appear before you,\r\n     asking the recognition of woman's political rights as one-half\r\n     the people. We ask no special privileges, no special legislation.\r\n     We simply ask that you live up to the principles enunciated by\r\n     the Democratic party from the time of Jefferson. By what\r\n     principle of democracy do men assume to legislate for women?\r\n     Women are part of the people; your very name signifies government\r\n     by the people. When you deny political rights to women you are\r\n     false to your own principles.\r\n\r\n     The Declaration of Independence recognized human rights as its\r\n     basis. Constitutions should also be general in character. But in\r\n     opposition to this principle the party in power for the last\r\n     twenty years has perverted the Constitution of the United States\r\n     by the introduction of the word \"male\" three times, thereby\r\n     limiting the application of its guarantees to a special class. It\r\n     should be your pride and your duty to restore the constitution to\r\n     its original basis by the adoption of a sixteenth amendment,\r\n     securing to women the right of suffrage; and thus establish the\r\n     equality of all United States citizens before the law.\r\n\r\n     Not for the first time do we make of you these demands. At your\r\n     nominating convention in New York, in 1868, Susan B. Anthony\r\n     appeared before you, asking recognition of woman's inherent\r\n     natural rights. At your convention of 1872, in Baltimore,\r\n     Isabella Beecher Hooker and Susan B. Anthony made a similar\r\n     appeal. In 1876, at St. Louis, Phoebe W. Couzins and Virginia L.\r\n     Minor presented our claims. Now, in 1880, our delegates are\r\n     present here from the Middle States, from the West and from the\r\n     South. The women of the South are rapidly uniting in their demand\r\n     for political recognition, as they have been the most deeply\r\n     humiliated by a recognition of the political rights of their\r\n     former slaves.\r\n\r\n     To secure to 20,000,000 of women the rights of citizenship is to\r\n     base your party on the eternal principles of justice; it is to\r\n     make yourselves the party of the future; it is to do away with a\r\n     more extended slavery than that of 4,000,000 of blacks; it is to\r\n     secure political freedom to half the nation; it is to establish\r\n     on this continent the democratic theory of the equal rights of\r\n     the people.\r\n\r\n     In furtherance of this demand we ask you to adopt the following\r\n     resolution:\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, Believing in the self-evident truth that all\r\n          persons are created with certain inalienable rights, and\r\n          that for the protection of these rights governments are\r\n          instituted, deriving their just powers from the consent of\r\n          the governed; therefore,\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the Democratic party pledges itself to use\r\n          all its powers to secure to the women of the nation\r\n          protection in the exercise of their right of suffrage.\r\n\r\n     On behalf of the National Woman Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n              MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, _Chairman Executive Committee_.\r\n\r\nThat the women however, in the campaign of 1880, received the best\r\ntreatment at the hands of the National Prohibition party is shown\r\nby the following invitation received at the Bloomington convention:\r\n\r\n     _To the National Woman Suffrage Association of the United\r\n     States:_\r\n\r\n     The woman suffragists are respectfully invited to meet with and\r\n     participate in the proceedings of the National Prohibition\r\n     Convention to be held at Cleveland, Ohio, June, 1880.\r\n\r\n                        JAMES BLACK, _Chairman of National Committee._\r\n\r\n     Per J. W. HAGGARD.\r\n\r\nA letter was received from Mr. Black urging the acceptance of the\r\ninvitation. Accordingly Miss Phoebe Couzins was sent as a delegate\r\nfrom the association. The Prohibition party in its eleventh plank\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     We also demand that women having privileges as citizens in other\r\n     respects, shall be clothed with the ballot for their own\r\n     protection, and as a rightful means for a proper settlement of\r\n     the liquor question.\r\n\r\nAfter attending all these nominating conventions, some of the\r\ndelegates[67] went to Wisconsin where the State and National\r\nAssociations held a joint convention, in the Opera House at\r\nMilwaukee, June 4, 5. Madam Anneke gave the address of welcome.[68]\r\nFresh from the exciting scenes of the presidential conventions, the\r\nspeakers were unusually earnest and aggressive. The resolutions\r\ndiscussed at the Indianapolis convention were considered and\r\nadopted. Carl Doerflinger read a greeting in behalf of the German\r\nRadicals of the city. Letters were read from prominent persons,\r\nexpressing their interest in the movement.[69] Dr. Laura Ross\r\nWolcott made all the arrangements and contributed largely to the\r\nexpenses of the convention. The roll of delegates shows that the\r\nState, at least, was well represented.[70]\r\n\r\nThus through the terrible heat of June this band of earnest women\r\nheld successive conventions in Bloomington, Ill., Grand Rapids,\r\nMich., Lafayette and Terre Haute, Ind. They were most hospitably\r\nentertained, and immense audiences greeted them at every point.\r\nMrs. Cordelia Briggs took the entire responsibility of the social\r\nand financial interests of the convention at Grand Rapids, which\r\ncontinued for three days with increasing enthusiasm to the close.\r\nMrs. Helen M. Gougar made the arrangements for Lafayette which were\r\nin every way successful.\r\n\r\nAfter the holding of these conventions, delegations from the\r\nNational Association called on the nominees of the two great\r\nparties to ascertain their opinions and proposed action, if any, on\r\nthe question of woman suffrage. Mrs. Blake, and other ladies\r\nrepresenting the New York city society, called on General Hancock\r\nat his residence and were most courteously received. In the course\r\nof a long conversation in which it was evident that he had given\r\nsome thought to the question, he said he would not veto a District\r\nof Columbia Woman Suffrage bill, provided such a bill should pass\r\ncongress, thereby putting himself upon better record than Horace\r\nGreely the year of his candidacy, who not only expressed himself as\r\nopposed to woman suffrage, but also declared that, if elected, he\r\nwould veto such a bill provided it passed congress.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony visited James A. Garfield at his home in Mentor, Ohio.\r\nHe was very cordial, and listened with respect to her presentation\r\nof the question. Although from time to time in congress he had\r\nuniformly voted with our friends, yet he expressed serious doubts\r\nas to the wisdom of pressing this measure during the pending\r\npresidential campaign.\r\n\r\nAs it was deemed desirable to get some expression on paper from the\r\ncandidates the following letter, written on official paper, was\r\naddressed to the Republican and Democratic nominees:\r\n\r\n                                   ROCHESTER, N. Y., August 17, 1880.\r\n\r\n     Hon. JAMES A. GARFIELD: _Dear Sir_: As vice-president-at-large of\r\n     the National Woman Suffrage Association, I am instructed to ask\r\n     you, if, in the event of your election, you, as President of the\r\n     United States, would recommend to congress, in your message to\r\n     that body, the submission to the several legislatures of a\r\n     sixteenth amendment to the national constitution, prohibiting the\r\n     disfranchisement of United States citizens on account of sex.\r\n     What we wish to ascertain is whether you, as president, would use\r\n     your _official influence_ to secure to the women of the several\r\n     States a _national guarantee_ of their right to a voice in the\r\n     government on the same terms with men. Neither platform makes any\r\n     pledge to secure political equality to women--hence we are\r\n     waiting and hoping that one candidate or the other, or both, will\r\n     declare favorably, and thereby make it possible for women, with\r\n     self-respect, to work for the success of one or the other or both\r\n     nominees. Hoping for a prompt and explicit statement, I am, sir,\r\n     very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                             SUSAN B. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\nTo this General Hancock vouchsafed no reply, while General Garfield\r\nresponded as follows:\r\n\r\n                                   MENTOR, O., August 25, 1880.\r\n\r\n     Dear MISS ANTHONY: Your letter of the 17th inst. came duly to\r\n     hand. I take the liberty of asking your personal advice before I\r\n     answer your official letter. I assume that all the traditions and\r\n     impulses of your life lead you to believe that the Republican\r\n     party has been and is more nearly in the line of liberty than its\r\n     antagonist the Democratic party; and I know you desire to advance\r\n     the cause of woman. Now, in view of the fact that the Republican\r\n     convention has not discussed your question, do you not think it\r\n     would be a violation of the trust they have reposed in me, to\r\n     speak, \"as their nominee\"--and add to the present contest an\r\n     issue that they have not authorized? Again, if I answer your\r\n     question on the ground of my own private opinion, I shall be\r\n     compelled to say, that while I am open to the freest discussion\r\n     and fairest consideration of your question, I have not yet\r\n     reached the conclusion that it would be best for woman and for\r\n     the country that she should have the suffrage. I may reach it;\r\n     but whatever time may do to me, that fruit is not yet ripe on my\r\n     tree. I ask you, therefore, for the sake of your own question, do\r\n     you think it wise to pick my apples now? Please answer me in the\r\n     frankness of personal friendship. With kind regards, I am very\r\n     truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                    JAMES A. GARFIELD.\r\n     Miss SUSAN B. ANTHONY, Rochester, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   ROCHESTER, N. Y., September 9, 1880.\r\n\r\n     Hon. JAMES A. GARFIELD: _Dear Sir_: Yours of the 25th ult. has\r\n     waited all these days that I might consider and carefully reply.\r\n\r\n     _First_. The Republican party did run well for a season in the\r\n     \"line of liberty\"; but since 1870, its congressional enactments,\r\n     majority reports, Supreme Court decisions, and now its\r\n     presidential platform, show a retrograde movement--not only for\r\n     women, but for colored men--limiting the power of the national\r\n     government in the protection of United States citizens against\r\n     the injustice of the States, until what we gained by the sword is\r\n     lost by political surrenders. And we need nothing but a\r\n     Democratic administration to demonstrate to all Israel and the\r\n     sun the fact, the sad fact, that all _is lost_ by the\r\n     _Republican_ party, and not _to be lost_ by the _Democratic_\r\n     party. I mean, of course, the one vital point of national\r\n     supremacy in the protection of United States citizens in the\r\n     enjoyment of their right to vote, and the punishment of States or\r\n     individuals thereof, for depriving citizens of the exercise of\r\n     that right. The first and fatal mistake was in ceding to the\r\n     States the right to \"abridge or deny\" the suffrage to\r\n     foreign-born men in Rhode Island, and all women throughout the\r\n     nation, in direct violation of the principle of national\r\n     supremacy. And from that time, inch by inch, point by point has\r\n     been surrendered, until it is only in _name_ that the Republican\r\n     party is the party of national supremacy. Grant did not protect\r\n     the negro's ballot in 1876--Hayes cannot in 1880--nor could\r\n     Garfield in 1884--for the \"sceptre has departed from Judah.\"\r\n\r\n     _Second_. For the candidate of a party to _add_ to the\r\n     discussions of the contest an issue unauthorized or unnoted in\r\n     its platform, when that issue was one vital to its very life,\r\n     would, it seems to me, be the grandest act imaginable. And, for\r\n     doing that very thing, with regard to the protection of the\r\n     negroes of the South, you are to-day receiving more praise from\r\n     the best men of the party, than for any and all of your\r\n     utterances _inside_ the line of the platform. And I _know_, if\r\n     you had in your letter of acceptance, or in your New York speech,\r\n     declared yourself in favor of \"perfect equality of rights for\r\n     women, civil and political,\" you would have touched an electric\r\n     spark that would have fired the heart of the women of the entire\r\n     nation, and made the triumph of the Republican party more grand\r\n     and glorious than any it has ever seen.\r\n\r\n     _Third_. As to picking fruit before it is ripe! Allow me to\r\n     remind you that very much fruit is _never_ picked; some gets\r\n     nipped in the blossom; some gets worm-eaten and falls to the\r\n     ground; some rots on the trees before it ripens; some, too slow\r\n     in ripening, gets bitten by the early frosts of autumn; while\r\n     some rich, rare, ripe apples hang unpicked, frozen and worthless\r\n     on the leafless trees of winter! Really, Mr. Garfield, if, after\r\n     passing through the war of the rebellion and sixteen years in\r\n     congress;--if, after seeing, and hearing, and repeating, that _no\r\n     class_ ever got justice and equality of chances from any\r\n     government except it had the power--the ballot--to clutch them\r\n     for itself;--if, after all your opportunities for growth and\r\n     development, you cannot yet see the truth of the great principle\r\n     of individual self-government;--if you have only reached the idea\r\n     of class-government, and that, too, of the most hateful and cruel\r\n     form--bounded by sex--there must be some radical defect in the\r\n     ethics of the party of which you are the chosen leader.\r\n\r\n     No matter which party administers the government, women will\r\n     continue to get only subordinate positions and half-pay, not\r\n     because of the party's or the president's lack of chivalric\r\n     regard for woman, but because, in the nature of things, it is\r\n     impossible for any government to protect a disfranchised class in\r\n     equality of chances. Women, to get justice, must have political\r\n     freedom. But pardon this long trespass upon your time and\r\n     patience, and please bear in mind that it is not for the many\r\n     _good_ things the Republican party and its nominee have done in\r\n     extending the area of liberty, that I criticise them, but because\r\n     they have failed to place the women of the nation on the plane of\r\n     political equality with men. I do not ask you to go beyond your\r\n     convictions, but I do most earnestly beg you to look at this\r\n     question from the stand-point of woman--alone, without father,\r\n     brother, husband, son--battling for bread! It is to help the\r\n     millions of these unfortunate ones that I plead for the ballot in\r\n     the hands of all women. With great respect for your frank and\r\n     candid talk with one of the disfranchised, I am very sincerely\r\n     yours,\r\n\r\n                                             SUSAN B. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Garfield was the only presidential nominee of either of the\r\ngreat parties who deigned a reply to the National Association, we\r\nhave given his letter an honored place in our history, and desire\r\nto pay this tribute to his memory, that while not fully endorsing\r\nour claims for political equality he earnestly advocated for woman\r\nall possible advantages of education, equal rights in the trades\r\nand professions, and equal laws for the protection of her civil\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nThe Thirteenth Annual Washington Convention assembled in Lincoln\r\nHall, January 18, 1881. The first session was devoted to memorial\r\nservices in honor of Lucretia Mott. A programme[71] for the\r\noccasion was extensively circulated, and the response in character\r\nand numbers was such an audience as had seldom before crowded that\r\nhall. The spacious auditorium was brilliant with sunlight and the\r\ngay dresses, red shawls and flowers of the ladies of the\r\nfashionable classes. Mrs. Hayes with several of her guests from the\r\nWhite House occupied front seats. The stage was crowded with\r\nmembers of the association, Mrs. Mott's personal friends and wives\r\nof members of congress. The decorations which had seldom been\r\nsurpassed in point of beauty and tastefulness of arrangement,\r\nformed a fitting setting for this notable assemblage of women. The\r\nbackground was a mass of colors, formed by the graceful draping of\r\nnational flags, here and there a streamer of old gold with heavy\r\nfringe to give variety, while in the center was a national shield\r\nsurmounted by two flags. On each side flags draped and festooned,\r\nfalling at the front of the stage with the folds of the rich maroon\r\ncurtains. Graceful ferns and foliage plants had been arranged,\r\nwhile on a table stood a large harp formed of beautiful red and\r\nwhite flowers.[72] At the other end was a stand of hot-house\r\nflowers, while in the center, resting on a background of maroon\r\ndrapery, was a large crayon picture of Lucretia Mott. Above the\r\npicture a snow-white dove held in its beak sprays of smilax,\r\ntrailing down on either side, and below was a sheaf of ripened\r\nwheat, typical of the life that had ended. The occasion which had\r\nbrought the ladies together, the placid features of that kind and\r\nwell-remembered face, had a solemnizing effect upon all, and\r\nquietly the vast audience passed into the hall. The late-comers\r\nfinding all the seats occupied stood in the rear and sat in the\r\naisles.\r\n\r\nPresently Miss Couzins, stepping to the front of the stage said\r\ngently, \"In accordance with the custom of Mrs. Mott and the\r\ntime-honored practice of the Quakers, I ask you to unite in an\r\ninvocation to the Spirit.\" She bowed her head. The audience\r\nfollowed her example. For several minutes the solemn stillness of\r\ndevotion pervaded the hall. When Miss Couzins had taken her seat\r\nthe quartette choir of St. Augustine's church (colored) which was\r\nseated on the platform, sang sweetly an appropriate selection,\r\nafter which Mrs. Stanton delivered the eulogy,[73] holding the\r\nrapt attention of her audience over an hour. At the close Frederick\r\nDouglass said:\r\n\r\n     He had listened with interest to the fine analysis of the life\r\n     and services of Lucretia Mott. He was almost unwilling to have\r\n     his voice heard after what had been said. He was there to show by\r\n     his presence his profound respect and earnest love for Lucretia\r\n     Mott. He recognized none whose services in behalf of his race\r\n     were equal to hers. Her silence even in that cause was more than\r\n     the speech of others. He had no words for this occasion.\r\n\r\nRobert Purvis at the request of a number of colored citizens of\r\nWashington, presented a beautiful floral harp to Mr. Davis, the\r\nson-in-law of Lucretia Mott, the only representative of her family\r\npresent. He paid a tender tribute to the noble woman whose\r\nlife-long friendship he had enjoyed. Mr. Davis having a seat on the\r\nplatform, received the gift with evident emotion, and returning\r\nthanks, he said:\r\n\r\n     He would follow the example of Mrs. Mott who seldom kept a gift\r\n     long, and present these rare flowers to Mrs. Spofford, the\r\n     treasurer of the Association.\r\n\r\n     Miss ANTHONY said: The highest tribute she could pay, was, that\r\n     during the past thirty years she had always felt sure she was\r\n     right when she had the approval of Lucretia Mott. Next to that of\r\n     her own conscience she most valued the approval of her sainted\r\n     friend. And it was now a great satisfaction that in all the\r\n     differences of opinion as to principles and methods in our\r\n     movement, Mrs. Mott had stood firmly with the National\r\n     Association, of which she was to the day of her death the honored\r\n     and revered vice-president.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sewall, after speaking of the many admirable qualities of Mrs.\r\nMott, said:\r\n\r\n     In looking around this magnificent audience I cannot help asking\r\n     myself the question, Where are the young girls? They should be\r\n     here. It is the birthright of every girl to know the life and\r\n     deeds of every noble woman. I think Lucretia Mott was as much\r\n     above the average woman as Abraham Lincoln above the average man.\r\n\r\nMiss Couzins closed with a few graceful words. She expressed her\r\npleasure in meeting so magnificent an audience, and thought the\r\nwhole occasion was a beautiful tribute to one of America's best and\r\nnoblest women. She hoped the mothers present would carry away the\r\nimpressions they had received and teach their daughters to hold the\r\nname of Lucretia Mott ever in grateful remembrance. The choir sang\r\n\"Nearer, My God, to Thee.\" The entire audience arose and joined in\r\nthe singing, after which they slowly dispersed, feeling that it had\r\nindeed been a pentacostal occasion.\r\n\r\nAn able paper from Alexander Dumas, on \"Woman Suffrage as a means\r\nof Moral Improvement and Prevention of Crime,\"[74] was translated\r\nfor this meeting by Thomas Mott, the only son of James and Lucretia\r\nMott. This convention continued two days, with the usual number of\r\nable speakers.[75] It was announced at the last session that an\r\neffort would be made by Senator McDonald, next day, to call up a\r\nresolution providing for the appointment of a standing committee\r\nfor women; accordingly the ladies' gallery in the Senate was well\r\nfilled with delegates.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Congressional Record_, January 20, 1881:\r\n\r\n     Mr. MCDONALD: On February 16, 1880, I submitted a resolution\r\n     providing for the appointment of a committee of nine senators,\r\n     whose duty it shall be to receive, consider and report upon all\r\n     petitions, memorials, resolutions and bills relating to the\r\n     rights of women of the United States, said committee to be called\r\n     \"Committee on the Rights of Women.\" It is on the calendar, and I\r\n     ask for its present consideration.\r\n\r\n     The VICE-PRESIDENT (Mr. Wheeler of New York): The senator from\r\n     Indiana calls up for consideration a resolution on the calendar,\r\n     which will be reported.\r\n\r\n     The chief clerk read the resolution, as follows:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That a committee of nine senators be appointed\r\n          by the Senate, whose duty it shall be to receive, consider\r\n          and report upon all petitions, memorials, resolutions and\r\n          bills relating to the rights of women of the United States,\r\n          said committee to be called the Committee on the Rights of\r\n          Women.\r\n\r\n     The VICE-PRESIDENT: The question is, Will the Senate agree to the\r\n     resolution?\r\n\r\n     Mr. MCDONALD: Mr. President, it seems to me that the time has\r\n     arrived when the rights of the class of citizens named in the\r\n     resolution should have some hearing in the national legislature.\r\n     We have standing committees upon almost every other subject, but\r\n     none to which this class of citizens can resort. When their\r\n     memorials come in they are sometimes sent to the Committee on the\r\n     Judiciary, sometimes to the Committee on Privileges and\r\n     Elections, and sometimes to other committees. The consequence is\r\n     that they pass around from committee to committee and never\r\n     receive any consideration. In the organization and growth of the\r\n     Senate a number of standing committees have been from time to\r\n     time created and continued from congress to congress, until many\r\n     of them have but very little duty now to perform. It seems to me\r\n     to be very appropriate to consider this question now, and provide\r\n     some place in the capitol, some room of the Senate, some branch\r\n     of the government, where this class of applicants can have a full\r\n     and fair hearing, and have such measures as may be desired to\r\n     secure to them such rights brought fairly and properly before\r\n     the country. I hope there will be no opposition to the resolution\r\n     but that it will be adopted by unanimous consent.\r\n\r\n     Mr. CONKLING: Does the senator from Indiana wish to raise a\r\n     permanent committee on this subject to take its place and remain\r\n     on the list of permanent committees?\r\n\r\n     Mr. MCDONALD: That is precisely what I propose to do.\r\n\r\n     Mr. CONKLING: Mr. President, I was in hopes that the honorable\r\n     senator from Indiana, knowing how sincere and earnest he is in\r\n     this regard, intended that an end should be made soon of this\r\n     subject; that the prayer of these petitioners should be granted\r\n     and the whole right established; but now it seems that he wishes\r\n     to create a perpetual committee, so that it is to go on\r\n     interminably, from which I infer that he intends that never shall\r\n     these prayers be granted. I suggest to the senator from Indiana\r\n     that, if he be in earnest, if he wishes to crown with success\r\n     this great and beneficent movement, he should raise a special\r\n     committee, which committee would understand that it was to\r\n     achieve and conclude its purpose, and this presently, and not\r\n     postpone indefinitely in the vast forever the realization of this\r\n     hope. I trust, therefore, that the senator from Indiana will make\r\n     this a special committee, and will let that special committee\r\n     understand that before the sun goes down on the last day of this\r\n     session it is to take final, serious, intelligent action, for\r\n     which it is to be responsible, whether that action be one way or\r\n     the other.[76]\r\n\r\n     Mr. MCDONALD: The senator from New York misapprehends one purpose\r\n     of this committee. I certainly have no desire that the rights of\r\n     this class of our citizens should be deferred to that far-distant\r\n     future to which he has made reference, nor would this committee\r\n     so place them. If it be authorized by the Senate, it will be the\r\n     duty of the committee to receive all petitions, memorials,\r\n     resolutions and bills relating to the rights of women, not merely\r\n     presented now but those presented at any future time. It is\r\n     simply to provide a place where one-half the people of the United\r\n     States may have a tribunal in this body before which they can\r\n     have their cases considered. I apprehend that these rights are\r\n     never to be ended. I do not suppose that the time will ever come\r\n     in the history of the human race when there will not be rights of\r\n     women to be considered and passed upon. Therefore, to make this\r\n     merely a special committee would not accomplish the purpose I had\r\n     in view. While it would of course give a committee that would\r\n     receive and hear such petitions as are now presented and consider\r\n     such bills as should now be brought forward, it would be better\r\n     to have a committee from term to term, where these same plaints\r\n     could be heard, the same petitions presented, the same bills\r\n     considered, and where new rights, whatever they might be, can be\r\n     discussed and acted upon. Therefore I cannot accept the\r\n     suggestion of the senator from New York to make this a special\r\n     committee.\r\n\r\n     Mr. DAVIS of West Virginia: I think it a bad idea to raise an\r\n     extra committee. I move that the resolution be referred to the\r\n     Committee on Rules, I think it ought to go there. That is where\r\n     the rules generally require all such resolutions to be referred.\r\n\r\n     The VICE-PRESIDENT: The question is on the motion of the senator\r\n     from Virginia, that the resolution be referred to the Committee\r\n     on Rules.\r\n\r\n     Which was agreed to by a vote of 26 yeas to 23 nays.[77]\r\n\r\nAmid all the pleasure of political excitement the social amenities\r\nwere not forgotten. A brilliant reception[78] and supper were given\r\nto the delegates by Mrs. Spofford at the Riggs House. During the\r\nevening Mrs. Stanton presented the beautiful life-size photograph\r\nof Lucretia Mott which had adorned the platform at the convention,\r\nto Howard University, and read the following letter from Edward M.\r\nDavis:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ELIZABETH CADY STANTON--_Dear Madam_: As an expression of my\r\n     gratitude to the colored people of the District for their\r\n     beautiful floral tribute to the memory of my dear mother, I\r\n     desire in the name of her children to present to Howard\r\n     University the photograph of Lucretia Mott which adorned the\r\n     platform during the convention. It is a fitting gift to an\r\n     institution that so well illustrates her principles in opening\r\n     its doors to all youth without regard to sex or color. With\r\n     sincere regret that I cannot be present this evening at the\r\n     reception, I am gratefully yours,\r\n\r\n                                             EDWARD M. DAVIS.\r\n\r\nIn receiving the beautiful gift, Dr. Patton, president of the\r\ninstitution, made a graceful response.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1881, the National Association held a series of\r\nconventions through New England, beginning with the May anniversary\r\nin Boston, of which we give the following description from the\r\n_Hartford Courant_:\r\n\r\n     Among the many anniversaries in Boston the last week in May, one\r\n     of the most enthusiastic was that of the National Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association, held in Tremont Temple. The weather was cool and\r\n     fair and the audience fine throughout, and never was there a\r\n     better array of speakers at one time on any platform. The number\r\n     of thoughtful, cultured young women appearing in these\r\n     conventions, is one of the hopeful features for the success of\r\n     this movement. The selection of speakers for this occasion had\r\n     been made at the Washington convention in January, and different\r\n     topics assigned to each that the same phases of the question\r\n     might not be treated over and over again.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jane H. Spofford]\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Harriet Hansom Robinson (wife of \"Warrington,\" so long the\r\n     able correspondent of the _Springfield Republican_), who with her\r\n     daughter made the arrangements for our reception, gave the\r\n     address of welcome, to which the president, Mrs. Stanton,\r\n     replied. Rev. Frederic Hinckley of Providence, spoke on \"Unity of\r\n     Principle in Variety of Method,\" and showed that while differing\r\n     on minor points the various woman suffrage associations were all\r\n     working to one grand end. Anna Garlin Spencer made a few remarks\r\n     on \"The Character of Reformers.\" Rev. Olympia Brown gave an\r\n     exceptionally brilliant speech a full hour in length on\r\n     \"Universal Suffrage\"; Harriette Robinson Shattuck's theme was\r\n     \"Believing and Doing\"; Lillie Devereux Blake's, \"Demand for\r\n     Liberty\"; Matilda Joslyn Gage's, \"Centralization\"; Belva A.\r\n     Lockwood's, \"Woman and the Law\". Mary F. Eastman followed showing\r\n     that woman's path was blocked at every turn, in the professions\r\n     as well as the trades and the whole world of work; Isabella\r\n     Beecher Hooker gave an able argument on the \"Constitutional Right\r\n     of Women to Vote\"; Martha McLellan Brown spoke equally well on\r\n     the \"Ethics of Sex\"; Mrs. Elizabeth Avery Meriwether of\r\n     Tennessee, gave a most amusing commentary on the spirit of the\r\n     old common law, cuffing Blackstone and Coke with merciless\r\n     sarcasm. Mrs. Elizabeth L. Saxon of Louisiana spoke with great\r\n     effect on \"Woman's Intellectual Powers as Developed by the\r\n     Ballot.\" These two Southern ladies are alike able, witty and\r\n     pathetic in their appeals for justice to woman. Mrs. May Wright\r\n     Sewall's essay on \"Domestic Legislation,\" showing how large a\r\n     share of the bills passed every year directly effect home life,\r\n     was very suggestive to those who in answer to our demand for\r\n     political power, say \"Woman's sphere is home,\" as if the home\r\n     were beyond the control and influence of the State. Beside all\r\n     these thoroughly prepared addresses, Susan B Anthony, Dr.\r\n     Clemence Lozier, Dr. Caroline Winslow, ex-Secretary Lee of\r\n     Wyoming, spoke briefly on various points suggested by the several\r\n     speakers.\r\n\r\n     The white-haired and venerable philosopher, A. Bronson Alcott,\r\n     was very cordially received, after being presented in\r\n     complimentary terms by the president. Mr. Alcott paid a glowing\r\n     tribute to the intellectual worth of woman, spoke of the divinity\r\n     of her character, and termed her the inspiration font from which\r\n     his own philosophical ideas had been drawn. Not until the women\r\n     of our nation have been granted every privilege would the liberty\r\n     of our republic be assured.[79] The well-known Francis W. Bird\r\n     of Walpole, who has long wielded in the politics of the Bay\r\n     State, the same power Thurlow Weed did for forty years in New\r\n     York, being invited to the platform, expressed his entire\r\n     sympathy with the demand for suffrage, notwithstanding the common\r\n     opinion held by the leading men of Massachusetts, that the women\r\n     themselves did not ask it. He recommended State rather than\r\n     national action.\r\n\r\n     Rev. Ada C. Bowles of Cambridge, and Rev. Olympia Brown, of\r\n     Racine, Wis., opened the various sessions with prayer--striking\r\n     evidence of the growing self-assertion of the sex, and the rapid\r\n     progress of events towards the full recognition of the fact that\r\n     woman's hour has come. Touching deeper and tenderer chords in the\r\n     human soul than words could reach, the inspiring strains of the\r\n     celebrated organist, Mr. Ryder, rose ever and anon, now soft and\r\n     plaintive, now full and commanding, mingled in stirring harmony\r\n     with prayer and speech. And as loving friends had covered the\r\n     platform with rare and fragrant flowers, the aesthetic taste of\r\n     the most fastidious artist might have found abundant\r\n     gratification in the grouping and whole effect of the assemblage\r\n     in that grand temple. Thus through six prolonged sessions the\r\n     interest was not only kept up but intensified from day to day.\r\n\r\n     The National Association was received right royally in Boston. On\r\n     arriving they found invitations waiting to visit Governor Long at\r\n     the State House, Mayor Prince at the City Hall, the great\r\n     establishment of Jordan, Marsh & Co., and the Reformatory Prison\r\n     for Women at Sherborn. Invitations to take part were extended to\r\n     woman suffrage speakers in many of the conventions of that\r\n     anniversary week. Among those who spoke from other platforms,\r\n     were Matilda Joslyn Gage, Ellen H. Sheldon, Caroline B. Winslow,\r\n     M. D., editor of _The Alpha_, and Rev. Olympia Brown. The\r\n     president of the association, Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton,\r\n     received many invitations to speak at various points, but had\r\n     time only for the \"Moral Education,\" \"Heredity,\" and \"Free\r\n     Religious\" associations. Her engagement at Parker Memorial Hall,\r\n     prevented her from accepting the governor's invitation, but\r\n     Isabella Beecher Hooker and Susan B Anthony led the way to the\r\n     State house and introduced the delegates from the East, the West,\r\n     the North and the South, to the honored executive head of the\r\n     State, who had declared himself, publicly, in favor of woman\r\n     suffrage. The ceremony of hand-shaking over, and some hundred\r\n     women being ranged in a double circle about the desk, Mrs. Hooker\r\n     stepped forward, saying:\r\n\r\n          Speak a word to us, Governor Long, we need help. Stand here,\r\n          please, face to face with these earnest women and tell us\r\n          where help is to come from.\r\n\r\n     The Governor responded, and then introduced his secretary, who\r\n     conducted the ladies through the building.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. HOOKER said: Permit me, sir, to thank you for this\r\n          unlooked-for and unusual courtesy in the name of our\r\n          president who should be here to speak for herself and for\r\n          us, and in the name of these loyal women who ask only that\r\n          the right of the _people_ to govern themselves shall be\r\n          maintained. In this great courtesy extended us by good old\r\n          Massachusetts as citizens of this republic unitedly\r\n          protesting against being taxed without representation, and\r\n          governed without our consent, we see the beginning of the\r\n          end--the end of our wearisome warfare--a warfare which\r\n          though bloodless, has cost more than blood, by as much as\r\n          soul-suffering exceeds that of mere flesh. I see as did\r\n          Stephen of old, a celestial form close to that of the Son of\r\n          Man, and her name is Liberty--always a woman--and she bids\r\n          us go on--go on--even unto the end.\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony standing close to the governor, said in low,\r\n     pathetic tones:\r\n\r\n          Yes, we are tired. Sir, we are weary with our work. For\r\n          forty years some of us have carried this burden, and now, if\r\n          we might lay it down at the feet of honorable men, such as\r\n          you, how happy we should be.\r\n\r\n     The next day Mayor Prince, though suffering from a late severe\r\n     attack of rheumatism, cordially welcomed the delegates in his\r\n     room at the City Hall, and chatting familiarly with those who had\r\n     been at the Cincinnati convention and witnessed his great\r\n     courtesy, some one remarked that from that time Miss Anthony had\r\n     proclaimed him the prince among men, and Mrs. Stanton immediately\r\n     suggested that if the party with which he was identified were\r\n     wise in their day and generation they would accept his\r\n     leadership, even to the acknowledgement of the full citizenship\r\n     of this republic, and thus secure not only their gratitude but\r\n     their enthusiastic support in the next presidential election.\r\n     Having compassion upon his Honor because of his manifest physical\r\n     disability, the ladies soon withdrew and went directly to the\r\n     house of Jordan, Marsh & Co., where were assembled in a large\r\n     hall at the top of the building such a crowd of handsome, happy,\r\n     young girls as one seldom sees in this work-a-day world; that\r\n     well-known Boston firm within the last six months having fitted\r\n     up a large recreation room for the use of their employes at the\r\n     noon hour. Half a hundred girls were merrily dancing to the music\r\n     of a piano, but ceased in order to listen to words of cheer from\r\n     Mrs. Lockwood, Mrs. Hooker and Mrs. Sewall. At the close of their\r\n     remarks Mr. Jordan brought forward a reluctant young girl who\r\n     could give us, if she would, a charming recitation from \"That\r\n     Lass o' Lowrie's,\" in return for our kindness in coming to them.\r\n     And after saying in a whisper to one who kindly urged compliance\r\n     to this unexpected call, that this had been such a busy day she\r\n     feared her dress was not all right, her face became unconscious\r\n     of self in a moment, and with true dramatic instinct, she gave\r\n     page after page of that wonderful story of the descent into the\r\n     mine and the recognition there of one whom she loved, precisely\r\n     as you would desire to hear it were the scene put upon the stage\r\n     with all the accessories of scenery and companion actors.\r\n\r\n     From Jordan, Marsh & Co.'s a large delegation proceeded to visit\r\n     the Reformatory Prison at Sherborn which was established three or\r\n     four years ago. The board of directors, consisting of three women\r\n     and two men, has charge of all the prisons of the State. Mrs.\r\n     Johnson, one of the directors, a noble, benevolent woman,\r\n     interested in the great charities of Boston, was designated by\r\n     Governor Long--through whose desire the Association visited the\r\n     prison--to do the honors and accompany the party from Boston. The\r\n     officers, matron and physician of the Sherborn prison, are all\r\n     women. Dr. Mosher, the superintendent, formerly the physician, is\r\n     a fair, noble-looking woman about thirty-five years of age. She\r\n     has her own separate house connected with the building. The\r\n     present physician, a delicate, cultured woman, with sympathy for\r\n     her suffering charges, is a recent graduate of Ann Arbor.\r\n\r\n     The entire work is done by the women sent there for restraint,\r\n     and the prison is nearly self-supporting; it is expected that\r\n     within another year it will be entirely so. Laundry work is done\r\n     for the city of Boston, shirts are manufactured, mittens knit,\r\n     etc. The manufacturing machinery will be increased the coming\r\n     year. The graded system of reward has been found successful in\r\n     the development of better traits. It has four divisions, and\r\n     through it the inmates are enabled to work up by good behavior\r\n     toward more pleasant surroundings, better clothes and food and\r\n     greater liberty. From the last grade they reach the freedom of\r\n     being bound out; of seventy-eight thus bound during the past year\r\n     but seven were returned. The whole prison, chapel, school-room,\r\n     dining-room, etc., possesses a sweet, clean, pure atmosphere. The\r\n     rooms are light, well-ventilated, vines trailing in the windows\r\n     from which glimpses of green trees and blue sky can be seen.\r\n\r\n     Added to all the other courtesies, there came the invitation to a\r\n     few of the representatives of the movement to dine with the Bird\r\n     Club at the Parker House, in the same cozy room where these\r\n     astute politicians have held their councils for so many years,\r\n     and whose walls have echoed to the brave words of many of New\r\n     England's greatest sons. The only woman who had ever been thus\r\n     honored before was Mrs. Stanton, who, \"escorted by Warrington,\"\r\n     dined with these honorable gentlemen in 1871. On this occasion\r\n     Susan B. Anthony and Harriet H. Robinson accompanied her. Around\r\n     the table sat several well-known reformers and distinguished\r\n     members of the press and bar. There was Elizur Wright whose name\r\n     is a household word in many homes as translator of La Fontaine's\r\n     fables for the children. Beside him sat the well-known Parker\r\n     Pillsbury and his nephew, a promising young lawyer in Boston. At\r\n     one end of the table sat Mr. Bird with Mrs. Stanton on his right\r\n     and Miss Anthony on his left. At the other end sat Frank Sanborn\r\n     with Mrs. Robinson (wife of \"Warrington\") on his right. On either\r\n     side sat Judge Adam Thayer of Worcester, Charles Field, Williard\r\n     Phillips of Salem, Colonel Henry Walker of Boston, Mr. Ernst of\r\n     the Boston _Advertiser_, and Judge Henry Fox of Taunton. The\r\n     condition of Russia and the Conkling imbroglio in New York; the\r\n     new version of the Testament and the reason why German Liberals,\r\n     transplanted to this soil, immediately become conservative and\r\n     exclusive, were all considered. Carl Schurz, with his narrow\r\n     ideas of woman's sphere and education, was mentioned by way of\r\n     example. In reply to the question how the Suffrage Association\r\n     felt in regard to Conkling's reelection. Mrs. Robinson said:\r\n\r\n          That the leaders, who are students of politics were unitedly\r\n          against him. Their only hope is in the destruction of the\r\n          Republican party, which is too old and corrupt to take up\r\n          any new reform.\r\n\r\n     Frank Sanborn, fresh from the perusal of the New Testament, asked\r\n     if women could find any special consolation in the Revised\r\n     Version regarding everlasting punishment. Mrs. Stanton replied:\r\n\r\n          Certainly, as we are supposed to have brought \"original sin\"\r\n          into the world with its fearful forebodings of eternal\r\n          punishment, any modification of Hades in fact or name, for\r\n          the _men_ of the race, the innocent victims of our\r\n          disobedience, fills us with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n     From the club the ladies hastened to the beautiful residence of\r\n     Mrs. Fenno Tudor, fronting Boston Common, where hundreds of\r\n     friends had already gathered to do honor to the noble woman so\r\n     ready to identify herself with the unpopular reforms of her day.\r\n     Among the many beautiful works of art, a chief attraction was the\r\n     picture of the grand-mother of Parnell, the Irish agitator, by\r\n     Gilbert Stuart. The house was fragrant with flowers, and the\r\n     unassuming manners of Mrs. Tudor, as she moved about among her\r\n     guests, reflected the glory of our American institutions in\r\n     giving the world a generation of common-sense women who do not\r\n     plume themselves on any adventitous circumstances of wealth or\r\n     position, but bow in respect to morality and intelligence\r\n     wherever they find it. At the close of the evening Mrs. Stanton\r\n     presented Mrs. Tudor with the \"History of Woman Suffrage\" which\r\n     she received with evident pleasure and returned her sincere\r\n     thanks.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the anniversary week in Boston, successful meetings\r\nwere held in various cities,[80] beginning at Providence, where Dr.\r\nWm. F. Channing made the arrangements. These conventions were the\r\nfirst that the National Association ever held in the New England\r\nStates, presenting the national plan of woman's enfranchisement\r\nthrough a sixteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[53] \"True labor reform: the ballot for woman, the unpaid laborer\r\nof the whole earth.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Man's work is from sun to sun,\r\n    But woman's work is never done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Taxation without representation is tyranny. Woman is taxed to\r\nsupport pauperism and crime, and is compelled to feed and clothe\r\nthe law-makers who oppress her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Women are voting on education, the bulwark of the republic, in\r\nKansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, Oregon, New Hampshire and\r\nMassachusetts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Women are voting on all questions in Wyoming and Utah. The vote of\r\nwomen transformed Wyoming from barbarism to civilization.\"\r\n\r\n\"The financial problem for woman: equal pay for equal work, and one\r\nhundred cents on the dollar.\"\r\n\r\n\"When a woman _Will_, she WILL, and you may depend on it, she WILL\r\nvote.\"\r\n\r\n[54] _California_, Jane B.

Spofford, _Treasurer_.\r\n\r\n[56] This week has been devoted almost exclusively to the women,\r\nwho as temperance leaders, female suffragists and general\r\nreformers, have become a power in the land which can no longer be\r\nridiculed or ignored. Yesterday Lincoln Hall was packed to its\r\nutmost capacity with such an audience as no other entertainment or\r\namusement has ever before gathered in this city. Women of\r\nrefinement and cultivation, of thought and purpose, women of\r\nstanding and position in society, mothers of families, wives of\r\nclergymen, were there by the hundreds, to listen to the words of\r\nwisdom and eloquence that fell from the lips of that assembly, the\r\nmost carefully organized, thoroughly governed, harmoniously acting\r\nassociation in this great country. Members of congress, professors\r\nof colleges, judges and gentlemen of leisure, sat or stood in\r\nadmiration of the progress of the women, who are so earnestly\r\nstriving to regenerate our beloved republic, over which the shadow\r\nof anarchy and dissolution is hovering with outspread wings. These\r\nwomen are no longer trembling suppliants, feeling their way\r\ncautiously and feebly amid an overpowering mass of obstructions;\r\nthey are now strong in their might, in their unity, and in the\r\nrighteousness of their cause. Men will do wisely if they attract\r\nthis power instead of repelling it; if they permit women to work in\r\nconcert with them, instead of compelling them to be arrayed against\r\nthem. The fate of Governor Robinson and Senator Ecelstine of New\r\nYork, indicates what they can do, and what they will do, if obliged\r\nto assume the attitude of aggressors. Congress has heard no such\r\neloquence upon its floors this week as we have listened to from the\r\nlips of these noble women.--[Washington correspondent of the\r\nPortland (Me.) _Transcript_, Jan. 23, 1880.\r\n\r\nThese conventions occur yearly and although the ladies have fought\r\nlong and hard, and seem to have not yet reached a positive\r\nassurance of success, still they continue to force the fight with\r\ngreater earnestness and redoubled energy, and their meetings are\r\nconducted with much wisdom and decided spirit. There is one thing\r\nto the credit of these ladies which cannot be said of the opposite\r\nsex, and that is, their conventions are models of good order and\r\nparliamentary eloquence, and they put their work through in a\r\ngraceful, business-like manner.--[Washington _Critic_, Jan. 21,\r\n1880.\r\n\r\nThe announcement that the public session of the National Woman\r\nSuffrage Convention would begin at one o'clock yesterday afternoon\r\nat Lincoln Hall sufficed to attract a most brilliant audience,\r\ncomposed principally of ladies, occupying every seat and thronging\r\nthe aisles. The inconvenience of remaining standing was patiently\r\nendured by hundreds who seemed loth to leave while the convention\r\nwas in progress.--[Washington _National Republican_, Jan. 22, 1880.\r\n\r\nThe session of the Woman Suffrage Convention in Washington this\r\nweek has developed the fact that these strong-minded women are\r\nmaking progress. The convention itself was composed of women of\r\nmarked ability, and its proceedings were marked by dignity and\r\ndecorum. The very best citizens of the city attended the\r\nmeetings.--[Washington correspondent Syracuse _Daily Standard_.\r\n\r\n[57] Letters were read from Mary Powers Filley, N. H.; Martha G.\r\nTunstall, Texas; M. A. Darling, Mich.; May Wright Thompson, Ind.;\r\nSarah Burger Stearns, Minn.; Miss Martin, Ill.; W. G. Myers, O.;\r\nAnnie L.

Wellman, esq., Ga.\r\n\r\n[58] Judge Edmunds meeting Miss Anthony afterwards, complimented\r\nher on having made an argument instead of what is usually given\r\nbefore committees, platform oratory. He said her logic was sound,\r\nher points unanswerable. Nor were the delegates familiar with that\r\nline of argument less impressed by it, given as it was without\r\nnotes and amid many interruptions. It was one of those occasions\r\nrarely reached, in which the speaker showed the full height to\r\nwhich she was capable of rising. We have not space for the whole\r\nargument, and the train of reasoning is too close to be\r\nbroken.--[M. J.

C. Stanton, President National Woman Suffrage Association,\r\n476 West Lake street:_\r\n\r\n_Dear Madam:_ I write you in behalf of the Chicago Historical\r\nSociety, and with the hope that you will obligingly secure for and\r\npresent to this society a full manuscript record of the\r\n_mass-meeting_ to be held in Farwell Hall in this city, June 2,\r\n1880, duly signed by its officers. We hope too you will do the\r\nsociety the great favor to deposit in its archives all the letters\r\nand postals which you may receive in response to your invitations\r\nto attend that meeting.\r\n\r\nThis meeting may be an important one and long to be remembered. It\r\nis hard to measure the possibilities of 1880. I hope this meeting\r\nwill mark an epoch in American history equal to the convention held\r\nin Independence Hall in 1776. How valuable would be the attested\r\nmanuscript record of that convention and the correspondence\r\nconnected therewith! The records of the Farwell-hall meeting may be\r\nequally valuable one hundred years hence. Please let the records be\r\nkept in the city in which the convention or mass-meeting is held.\r\n\r\nI am a Republican. I hope the party to which I belong will be\r\nconsistent. On the highest stripe of its banner is inscribed\r\n\"Freedom and Equal Rights.\" I hope the party will not be so\r\ninconsistent as to refuse to the \"better half\" of the people of the\r\nUnited States the rights enjoyed by the liberated slaves at the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nThe leaders should not be content _to suffer it to be so_, but\r\nshould work with a will to make it so. I have but little confidence\r\nin the sincerity of the man who will shout himself hoarse about\r\n\"shot guns\" and \"intimidation\" at the South, when ridicule and\r\nsneers come from his \"shot gun\" pointed at those who advocate the\r\ndoctrine that our mothers, wives and sisters are as well qualified\r\nto vote and hold official position as the average Senegambian of\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nWe should be glad to have you and your friends call at these rooms,\r\nwhich are open and free for all.\r\n\r\n                    Very Respectfully,       A. D. HAGER, _Librarian_.\r\n\r\n[63] By Mrs. Saxon of New Orleans, La.; Mrs. Meriwether of Memphis,\r\nMrs. Sallie Clay Bennett, daughter of Cassius M. Clay of Richmond\r\nKy.; and others. Mrs. Bennett related a little home incident. She\r\nsaid: A few days ago she was in her front yard planting with her\r\nown hands some roses, when \"our ex-governor,\" passing by,\r\nexclaimed: \"Mrs. Bennett, I admire that in you; whatever one wants\r\nwell done he must do himself.\" She immediately answered: \"That is\r\ntrue Governor, and that is why we women suffragists have determined\r\nto do our own voting hereafter.\" She then informed him that she\r\nwanted to speak to him on that great question. He was rather\r\nanxious to avoid the argument, and expressed his surprise and \"was\r\nsorry to see a woman like her, surrounded by so many blessings,\r\nwith a kind husband, numerous friends and loving children,\r\nadvocating woman suffrage! She ought to be contented with these.\r\nShe was not like Miss Anthony--\" \"Stop, Governor,\" I exclaimed,\r\n\"Don't think of comparing me to that lady, for I feel that I am not\r\nworthy to touch the hem of her garments.\" She was, she said, indeed\r\nthe mother of five dear children, but she [Miss Anthony] is the\r\nmother of a nation of women. She thought the women feared God\r\nrather than man, and it was only this which encouraged them to\r\nspeak on this subject, so dear to their hearts, in public. One lady\r\ngave as a reason why she wanted to vote, that it was because \"the\r\nmen did not want them to,\" which evoked considerable merriment.\r\nThis induced the chair to remind the audience of Napoleon's rule:\r\n\"Go, see what your enemy does not want you to do and do it.\" Of the\r\naudience the _Inter-Ocean_ said: \"The speakers of all the sessions\r\nwere listened to with rapt attention by the audience, and the\r\npoints made were heartily applauded.

A special committee is a\r\ntransient one to be decided upon at the opening of each congress;\r\nhence may be at any time voted out of existence. No one understood\r\nthis better than New York's Stalwart senator, and his plausible\r\nmanner of killing the measure deceived the very elect. Enough\r\nsenators were pledged to have carried Mr. McDonald's motion had it\r\nbeen properly understood, but they, as well as some of the ladies\r\nin the gallery, were entirely misled by Mr. Conkling's seeming\r\nearnest intention to hasten the demands of the women by a\r\nshort-lived committee, and while those in the gallery applauded,\r\nthose on the floor defeated the measure they intended to carry.\r\n\r\n[77] _Yeas_--Messrs.

George\r\nF. Hoar in the Senate, and Hon. John D. White in the House, for a\r\nspecial committee to look after the interests of women.[81] It\r\npassed by a vote of 115 to 84 in the House, and by 35 to 23 in the\r\nSenate. On December 13, 1881, the Senate Committee on Rules\r\nreported the following resolution for the appointment of a special\r\ncommittee on woman suffrage:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That a select committee of seven senators be\r\n          appointed by the Chair, to whom shall be referred all\r\n          petitions, bills and resolves providing for the extension of\r\n          suffrage to women or the removal of their legal\r\n          disabilities.\r\n\r\n                                                  DECEMBER 14.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: I move to take up the resolution reported by the\r\n     Committee on Rules yesterday, for the appointment of a select\r\n     committee on the subject of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n     Mr. VEST: Mr. President, I am constrained to object to the\r\n     passage of this resolution, and I do it with considerable\r\n     reluctance. At present we have thirty standing committees of the\r\n     Senate; four joint and seven special committees, in addition to\r\n     the one now proposed.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The Chair will inform the senator\r\n     from Missouri that a majority of the Senate has to decide whether\r\n     the resolution shall be considered.\r\n\r\n     Mr. VEST: I understood the Chair to state that it was before the\r\n     Senate.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: It is before the Senate if there be\r\n     no objection. The Chair thought the senator made objection to its\r\n     consideration.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: It went over under the rule yesterday and comes up now.\r\n\r\n     Mr. EDMUNDS: It is the regular order now.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: Certainly. The Chair thought the\r\n     senator from Missouri objected to its consideration.\r\n\r\n     Mr. VEST: No, sir.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The resolution is before the Senate\r\n     and open to debate.\r\n\r\n     Mr. VEST: I have had the honor for a few years to be a member of\r\n     the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, and my colleagues\r\n     on that committee will bear witness with me to the trouble and\r\n     annoyance which at every session have arisen in regard to giving\r\n     accommodations to the special committees. Two sessions ago there\r\n     was a conflict between the Senate and House in regard to\r\n     furnishing committee-rooms for three special committees, and it\r\n     is only upon the doctrine of _pedis possessio_ that the Senate\r\n     to-day holds three committee-rooms in the capitol, the House\r\n     still laying claim as a matter of law, through their Committee on\r\n     Public Buildings and Grounds, for the possession of these rooms.\r\n     At the special session, on account of the exigencies in regard to\r\n     rooms, we were compelled to take the retiring-room assigned near\r\n     the gallery to the ladies, and cut it into two rooms, to\r\n     accommodate select committees.\r\n\r\n     At this session we have created two special committees more, and\r\n     I should like to make the inquiry when and where this manufacture\r\n     of special committees is to cease? As soon as any subject becomes\r\n     one of comment in the newspapers, or, respectfully I say it, a\r\n     hobby with certain zealous partisans throughout the country,\r\n     application is made to the Senate of the United States and a\r\n     special committee is to be appointed. For this reason, and for\r\n     the simple reason that a stop must be had somewhere to the\r\n     raising of special committees, I oppose the proposition now\r\n     before the Senate.\r\n\r\n     But, Mr. President, I will be entirely ingenuous and give another\r\n     reason. This is simply a step toward the recognition of woman\r\n     suffrage, and I am opposed to it upon principle in its inception.\r\n     In my judgment it has nothing but mischief in it to the\r\n     institutions and to the society of this whole country. I do not\r\n     propose to enter into a discussion of that subject to-day, but it\r\n     will be proper for me to make this statement, and I make it\r\n     intending no reflection upon the zealous ladies who have engaged\r\n     for the past ten years in manufacturing a public sentiment upon\r\n     this question. I received to-day a letter from a distinguished\r\n     lady in my own State, for whom I have personally the greatest\r\n     admiration and respect, calling my attention to the fact that I\r\n     propose to deny justice to the women of the country. Mr.\r\n     President, I deny it. It is because I believe that the\r\n     conservative influence of society in the United States rests with\r\n     the women of the country that I propose not to degrade the wife\r\n     and mother to the ward politician, the justice of the peace, or\r\n     the notary public. It is because I believe honestly that all the\r\n     best influences for the conservation of society rest upon the\r\n     women of the country in their proper sphere that I shall oppose\r\n     this and every other step now and henceforth as violating, as I\r\n     believe, one of the great essential fundamental laws of nature\r\n     and of society.\r\n\r\n     Mr. President, the revenges of nature are sure and unerring, and\r\n     these revenges are just as certain in political matters and in\r\n     social matters as in the physical world. Now and here I desire to\r\n     record once for all my conviction that in this movement to take\r\n     the women of the country out of their proper sphere of social\r\n     influence, that great and glorious sphere in which nature and\r\n     nature's God have placed them, and rush them into the political\r\n     arena, the attempt is made to put them where they were never\r\n     intended to be; and I now and here record my opposition to it.\r\n     This may seem to be but a small matter, but as this letter shows,\r\n     and I reveal no private confidence, it recognizes the first great\r\n     step in this reform, as its advocates are pleased to term it. My\r\n     practice and conviction as a public man is to fight every wrong\r\n     wherever I believe it to exist. I am opposed to this movement. I\r\n     am opposed to it upon principle, upon conviction, and I shall\r\n     call for the yeas and nays in order to record my vote against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  DECEMBER 15.\r\n\r\n     The Senate resumed the consideration of the resolution reported\r\n     from the Committee on Rules by Mr. Hoar on the 13th inst.\r\n\r\n     Mr. VEST: Mr. President, I disclaim any intention again to incite\r\n     or excite any general discussion in regard to woman suffrage. The\r\n     senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Hoar], for whom I have very great\r\n     regard, was yesterday pleased to observe that the State\r\n     governments furnished by the senator from Missouri and other\r\n     senators in the past had been no argument in favor of manhood\r\n     suffrage. Mr. President, I have been under the impression that\r\n     the American people to-day are the best governed, the best\r\n     clothed, the best fed, the best housed, the happiest people upon\r\n     the face of the globe, and that, too, notwithstanding the fact\r\n     that they have been under the domination of the Republican party\r\n     for twenty long years. I have also been under the impression that\r\n     the institutions of the States and of the United States are an\r\n     improvement upon all governmental theories and schemes hitherto\r\n     known to mortal man; but we are to learn to-day from the senator\r\n     from Massachusetts that this government and the State governments\r\n     have been failures, and that woman suffrage must be introduced in\r\n     order to purify the political atmosphere and elevate the\r\n     suffrage.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: Will the senator allow me to interrupt him for a\r\n     moment?\r\n\r\n     Mr. VEST: Of course.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: I desire to disclaim the meaning which the honorable\r\n     senator seems to have put upon my words. I agree with him that\r\n     the American governments have been the best on the face of the\r\n     earth, but it is because of their adoption of that principle of\r\n     equality more than any other government, the logical effect of\r\n     which will compel them to yield the right prayed for to women,\r\n     that they are the best. But still best as they are, I said, and\r\n     mean to say, that the business of governing mankind has been the\r\n     one business on the face of the earth which has been done most\r\n     clumsily, which has been, even where most excellent, full of\r\n     mistakes, expense, injustice, and wrong-doing. What I said was\r\n     that I did not think the persons to whom that privileged function\r\n     had been committed so far were entitled to claim any special\r\n     superiority for the masculine intellect in the results which it\r\n     had achieved.\r\n\r\n     Mr. VEST: To say that the governments, State and national, now in\r\n     existence upon this continent are imperfect is but to announce\r\n     the truism that everything made by man is necessarily imperfect.\r\n     But I stand here to declare to-day that the governments of the\r\n     States, and the national government, in theory, although failing\r\n     sometimes in practice, are a standing monument to the genius and\r\n     intellect of the men who created them. But the senator from\r\n     Massachusetts was pleased to say further, that woman suffrage\r\n     should obtain in this country in the interest of education. I\r\n     permit not that senator to go further than myself in the line of\r\n     universal public education. I have declared, over and over again,\r\n     in every county in my State for the past ten years, that\r\n     universal education should accompany universal suffrage, that the\r\n     school-house should crown every mound in prairie and forest, that\r\n     it was the temple of liberty and the altar of law and order.\r\n\r\n     I well remember that I was thrilled with the eloquence of the\r\n     distinguished senator from Massachusetts at the last session of\r\n     the last congress, when, upon a bill to provide for general\r\n     education by a donation of the public lands, he so pathetically\r\n     and justly described the mass of dark ignorance and illiteracy\r\n     projected upon the people of the South under the policy of the\r\n     Republican party, and the senator then stood here and said that\r\n     the people of Massachusetts extended the public lands to relieve\r\n     the people of the South from this monstrous burden. What does the\r\n     senator propose to do to-day? He proposes with one stroke of the\r\n     pen to double, and more than double, the illiterate suffrage of\r\n     the United States. The senator says that one-half the people of\r\n     the United States are represented in this measure of woman\r\n     suffrage. I deny it, sir. If the senator means that the women of\r\n     America, comprising one-half of the population, are interested in\r\n     this measure, I deny it most emphatically and most peremptorily.\r\n     Not one-tenth of them want it. Not one-tenth of the mothers and\r\n     sisters and Christian women of this land want to be turned into\r\n     politicians or to meddle in a sphere to which God and nature have\r\n     not assigned them.\r\n\r\n     Sir, there are some ladies--and I do not intend to term them\r\n     anything but ladies--who are zealously engaged in this cause, and\r\n     they have flooded this hall with petitions, and have called their\r\n     women's rights conventions all over the land. I assail not their\r\n     motives, but I deny that they represent the women of the United\r\n     States. I say that if woman suffrage obtains, the worst class of\r\n     the women of the country will rush to the polls and the best\r\n     class will remain away by a large majority. That is my deliberate\r\n     judgment and firm conviction. But, Mr. President, a word in\r\n     regard to the committees. I desire no general discussion upon\r\n     woman suffrage, and simply alluded in passing to what had been\r\n     said by the senator from Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The hour of one o'clock has arrived,\r\n     and the morning hour is closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  DECEMBER 16.\r\n\r\n     Mr. JONES of Florida: I desire to call up a resolution now lying\r\n     on the table, which I introduced on the 14th instant, calling for\r\n     information from the Secretary of War touching a ship-canal\r\n     across the peninsula of Florida.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: Mr. President--\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The senator from Florida asks leave\r\n     to call up a resolution submitted by him.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: My resolution was before the Senate yesterday, and\r\n     comes up in order. I hope we shall vote on it.\r\n\r\n     Mr. JONES of Florida: I will only say that my resolution was laid\r\n     over temporarily on the objection of the senator from Vermont\r\n     [Mr. Edmunds], which he will not insist upon.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: Allow me to call the attention of the Chair to the\r\n     fact; it is not the question of a resolution which has not been\r\n     taken up. The resolution reported by me from the Committee on\r\n     Rules was taken up, and was under discussion when the senator\r\n     from Missouri [Mr. Vest] was taken from the floor by the\r\n     expiration of the morning hour, in the midst of his remarks.\r\n     Certainly his right to conclude his remarks takes precedence of\r\n     other business under the usual practice of the Senate.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The Chair thought the senator from\r\n     Missouri had ended his remarks, or he would not have interposed\r\n     when he did.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: No, sir.\r\n\r\n     Mr. JONES of Florida: My resolution involves no debate. It is\r\n     merely a resolution of inquiry.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: The other will be disposed of, I hope, in a few\r\n     moments.\r\n\r\n     Mr. JONES of Florida: The resolution to which I refer went over\r\n     informally on the objection of the senator from Vermont, and I\r\n     think he has no objection now.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: The other will be disposed of in a moment, and I hope\r\n     we shall vote on it.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The Chair lays before the Senate the\r\n     resolution of the senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Hoar].\r\n\r\n     The Senate resumed the consideration of the resolution reported\r\n     from the Committee on Rules by Mr. Hoar on the 13th instant.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The Chair would state to the senator\r\n     from Missouri [Mr. Vest] that the Chair supposed yesterday that\r\n     he had finished his remarks, or the Chair would not have stopped\r\n     him at that moment. The question is on agreeing to the\r\n     resolution, on which the senator from Missouri [Mr. Vest] is\r\n     entitled to the floor.\r\n\r\n     Mr. VEST: Mr. President, I was on the eve of finishing my remarks\r\n     yesterday when the morning hour expired, and I do not now wish to\r\n     detain the Senate. I was about to say at that time that the\r\n     Senate now has forty-one committees, with a small army of\r\n     messengers and clerks, one-half of whom, without exaggeration,\r\n     are literally without employment. I shall not pretend to specify\r\n     the committees of this body which have not one single bill,\r\n     resolution, or proposition of any sort pending before them, and\r\n     have not had for months. I am very well aware that if I should\r\n     name one of them, Liberty would lie bleeding in the streets at\r\n     once, and that committee would become the most important on the\r\n     list of committees of the Senate. I shall not venture to do that.\r\n     I am informed by the Sergeant-at-arms that if this resolution is\r\n     adopted he must have six additional messengers to be added to\r\n     that body of ornamental employes who now stand or sit at the\r\n     doors of the respective committee-rooms. I have heard that this\r\n     committee is for the purpose of giving a committee to a senator\r\n     in this body. I have heard the statement made, but I cannot\r\n     believe it, and I am very certain that no senator will undertake\r\n     to champion the resolution upon any such ground.\r\n\r\n     The senator from Massachusetts was pleased to say that the\r\n     Committee on the Judiciary had so many important questions\r\n     pending before it, that the subject of woman suffrage should not\r\n     be added to them. The Committee on Territories is open to any\r\n     complaint or suggestion by the ladies who advocate woman\r\n     suffrage, in regard to this subject in the territories; and the\r\n     Committee on Privileges and Elections to which this subject\r\n     should go most appropriately, as affecting the suffrage, has not\r\n     now before it, as I am informed, one single bill, resolution, or\r\n     proposition of any sort whatever. That committee is also open to\r\n     inquiry upon this subject.\r\n\r\n     But, Mr. President, out of all committees without business, and\r\n     habitually without business, in this body, there is one that\r\n     beyond any question could take jurisdiction of this matter and do\r\n     it ample justice. I refer to that most respectable and antique\r\n     institution, the Committee on Revolutionary Claims. For thirty\r\n     years it has been without business. For thirty long years the\r\n     placid surface of that parliamentary sea has been without one\r\n     single ripple. If the senator from Massachusetts desires a\r\n     tribunal for calm judicial equilibrium and examination, a\r\n     tribunal far from the \"madding crowd's ignoble strife,\" a\r\n     tribunal eminently respectable, dignified and unique, why not\r\n     send this question to the Committee on Revolutionary Claims? When\r\n     I name the _personnel_ of that committee it will be evident that\r\n     any consideration on any subject touching the female sex would\r\n     receive not only deliberate but immediate attention, for the\r\n     second member upon that committee is my distinguished friend from\r\n     Florida [Mr. Jones], and who can doubt that he would give his\r\n     undivided attention to the subject? [Laughter.] It is eminently\r\n     proper that this subject should go to that committee because if\r\n     there is any revolutionary claim in this country it is that of\r\n     woman suffrage. [Laughter.] It revolutionizes society; it\r\n     revolutionizes religion; it revolutionizes the constitution and\r\n     laws; and it revolutionizes the opinions of those so\r\n     old-fashioned among us as to believe that the legitimate and\r\n     proper sphere of woman is the family circle as wife and mother\r\n     and not as politician and voter--those of us who are proud to\r\n     believe that--\r\n\r\n          A woman's noblest station is retreat;\r\n          Her fairest virtues fly from public sight;\r\n          Domestic worth--that shuns too strong a light.\r\n\r\n     Before that Committee on Revolutionary Claims why could not this\r\n     most revolutionary of all claims receive immediate and ample\r\n     attention? More than that, as I said before, if there is any\r\n     tribunal that could give undivided time and dignified attention,\r\n     is it not this committee? If there is one peaceful haven of rest,\r\n     never disturbed by any profane bill or resolution of any sort, it\r\n     is the Committee on Revolutionary Claims. It is, in parliamentary\r\n     life, described by that ecstatic verse in Watts' hymn:\r\n\r\n          There shall I bathe my wearied soul\r\n            In seas of endless rest,\r\n          And not one wave of trouble roll\r\n            Across my peaceful breast.\r\n\r\n     For thirty years there has been no excitement in that committee,\r\n     and it needs to-day, in Western phrase, some \"stirring-up.\" By\r\n     all natural laws stagnation breeds disease and death; and what\r\n     could stir up this most venerable and respectable institution\r\n     more than an application of the strong-minded, with short hair\r\n     and shorter skirts, invading its dignified realm and elucidating\r\n     all the excellences of female suffrage? Moreover, if these ladies\r\n     could ever succeed, in the providence of God, in obtaining a\r\n     report from that committee, it would end this question forever;\r\n     for the public at large and myself included, in view of that\r\n     miracle of female blandishment and female influence, would\r\n     surrender at once, and female suffrage would become\r\n     constitutional and lawful. Sir, I insist upon it that in\r\n     deference to this committee, in deference to the fact that it\r\n     needs this sort of regimen and medicine, this whole subject\r\n     should be so referred. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n     Mr. MORRILL: Mr. President, I do not desire to say anything as to\r\n     the merits of the resolution, but I understand the sole purpose\r\n     of raising this committee is to have a committee-room. So far as\r\n     I know, there are some five or six committees now which are\r\n     destitute of rooms, and it would be impossible for the Committee\r\n     on Public Buildings and Grounds to assign any room to this\r\n     committee--the object which I understand is at the foundation of\r\n     the introduction of the proposition; that is to say, to give\r\n     these ladies an opportunity to be heard in some appropriate\r\n     committee-room on the questions which they wish to agitate and\r\n     submit.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: They would find room in some other committee-room. They\r\n     could have the room of the Committee on Privileges and Elections,\r\n     if there were no other place.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The question is on the adoption of\r\n     the resolution reported by the senator from Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HARRIS: Did not the senator from Missouri [Mr. Vest] offer an\r\n     amendment?\r\n\r\n     Mr. GARLAND: As I understand, he moved to refer the subject to\r\n     the Committee on Revolutionary Claims.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: Does the Chair understand that the\r\n     senator from Missouri has offered an amendment?\r\n\r\n     Mr. VEST: Yes, sir; I move to refer the matter to the Committee\r\n     on Revolutionary Claims.\r\n\r\n     Mr. CONGER: Let the resolution be reported.\r\n\r\n     The acting secretary read the resolution.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The senator from Missouri offers an\r\n     amendment, that the subject be referred to the standing Committee\r\n     on Revolutionary Claims. The question is on the amendment of the\r\n     senator from Missouri. [Putting the question.] The noes appear to\r\n     have it.\r\n\r\n     Mr. FARLEY called for the yeas and nays, and they were ordered\r\n     and taken.\r\n\r\n     Mr. BLAIR [after having voted in the negative]: I have voted\r\n     inadvertently. I am paired with the senator from Alabama [Mr.\r\n     Pugh]. Were he present he would have voted \"yea,\" as I have voted\r\n     \"nay.\" I withdraw my vote.\r\n\r\n     Mr. WINDOM: I am paired with the senator from West Virginia [Mr.\r\n     Davis], but as I understand he would vote \"nay\" on this question,\r\n     I vote \"nay.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. INGALLS: I am paired with the senator from Mississippi [Mr.\r\n     Lamar].\r\n\r\n     The result was announced--yeas 22, nays 31. So the motion was not\r\n     agreed to.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The question recurs on the adoption\r\n     of the resolution.\r\n\r\n     Mr. BAYARD: Is it in order for me to move the reference of the\r\n     subject to the Committee on the Judiciary?\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: It is in order to move to refer the\r\n     resolution to the Committee on the Judiciary, the Chair\r\n     understands.\r\n\r\n     Mr. BAYARD: Then I make a motion that the resolution be sent to\r\n     the Committee on the Judiciary. I would state that I voted with\r\n     some regret and hesitancy upon the motion of the senator from\r\n     Missouri [Mr. Vest] to refer this matter to the Committee on\r\n     Revolutionary Claims. My regret was owing to the fact that I do\r\n     not wish even to seem to treat a subject of this character in a\r\n     spirit of levity, or to indicate the slightest disrespect by such\r\n     a reference, to those whose opinions upon this subject differ\r\n     essentially from my own. I cast the vote because I considered it\r\n     would be taking the subject virtually away from the consideration\r\n     of congress at its present session. I do, however, hold that\r\n     there is no necessity for the creation of a special committee to\r\n     attend to this subject. The Committee on the Judiciary has within\r\n     the last few years, upon many occasions, attempted to deal with\r\n     it. Since you, sir, and I have been members of that committee--\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: Mr. President--\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: Will the senator from Delaware yield\r\n     to the senator from Massachusetts?\r\n\r\n     Mr. BAYARD: I will, if he thinks it necessary to interrupt me.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: I desire to ask the senator, if he is willing, having\r\n     been lately a member of the committee to which he refers, whether\r\n     it is not the rule of that committee to allow no hearings to\r\n     individual petitioners, a rule which is departed from only in\r\n     very rare and peculiar cases?\r\n\r\n     Mr. BAYARD: I will reply to the honorable senator that the\r\n     occasion which arose to my mind and caused me to remember the\r\n     action of that committee was the audience given by it to a very\r\n     large delegation of woman suffragists, _to wit_, the\r\n     representatives of a convention held in this city, who to the\r\n     number, I think, of twenty-five, came into the committee-room of\r\n     the Committee on the Judiciary, and were heard, as I remember,\r\n     for more than one day, or certainly had more than one hearing,\r\n     before that committee, of which you, sir, and I were members.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: If the senator will pardon me, however, he has not\r\n     answered my question. I asked the senator not whether on one\r\n     particular occasion they gave a hearing on this subject, but\r\n     whether it is not the rule of that committee, occasioned by the\r\n     necessity of its business, from which it departs only in very\r\n     rare cases, not to give hearings?\r\n\r\n     Mr. BAYARD: I cannot answer whether a rule so defined as that\r\n     suggested by the honorable senator from Massachusetts exists in\r\n     that committee. It is my impression, however, that cases are\r\n     frequently, by order of that committee, argued before it. We have\r\n     had very elaborate and able arguments upon subjects connected\r\n     with the Pacific railroads, I remember; and we have had arguments\r\n     upon various subjects. It is constantly our pleasure to hear\r\n     members of the Senate upon a variety of questions before that\r\n     committee. It may be only a proof that women's rights are not\r\n     unrecognized nor their influence unfelt when I state the fact\r\n     that if there be such a rule as is suggested by the honorable\r\n     senator from Massachusetts of excluding persons from the audience\r\n     of that committee, on the occasion of the application of the\r\n     ladies a hearing was granted, and they came in force,--not only\r\n     force in numbers, but force in the character and intelligence of\r\n     those who appeared before the committee. They were listened to\r\n     with great respect, but their views were not concurred in by the\r\n     committee as it was then composed. We were all entertained by the\r\n     bright wit, the clever and, in my judgment, in many respects, the\r\n     just sarcasm of our honorable friend from Missouri [Mr. Vest],\r\n     but my habit is not to consider public measures in a jocular\r\n     light; it is not to consider a question of this kind in a jocular\r\n     light. Whatever may be the merits or demerits of this\r\n     proposition, whatever may be the reasons for or against it, no\r\n     man can doubt that it will strike at the very roots of the\r\n     present organization of society, and that its consequences will\r\n     be most profound and far-reaching should the advocates of the\r\n     measure proposed prevail.\r\n\r\n     Therefore it is that I think this subject should not be\r\n     considered separately; it should not have a special\r\n     committee--either of advocates or opponents arranged for its\r\n     consideration; but it should go where proposed amendments to the\r\n     fundamental law of the land have always been sent for\r\n     consideration,--to that committee to which judicial questions,\r\n     questions of a constitutional nature, have always in the history\r\n     of this government been committed. There is no need, there is no\r\n     justice, there is no wisdom in attempting to separate the fate of\r\n     this question, which affects society so profoundly and generally,\r\n     from the other questions that affect society. It cannot be made a\r\n     specialty: it ought not to be. You cannot tear this question from\r\n     the great contest of human passions, affections, and interests\r\n     which surround it, and treat it as a thing by itself. It has many\r\n     sides from which it may be viewed, some that are not proper or\r\n     fitting for this forum, and a discussion now in public. There are\r\n     the claims of religion itself to be considered in connection with\r\n     this case. Civil rights, social rights, political rights,\r\n     religious rights, all are bound up in the consideration of a\r\n     measure like this. In its consideration you cannot safely attempt\r\n     to segregate this question and leave it untouched and\r\n     uninfluenced by all those other questions by which it is\r\n     surrounded and in the consideration of which it is bound to be\r\n     connected and concerned. Therefore, without going further,\r\n     prematurely, into a discussion of the merits of the proposition\r\n     itself or its desirability, I say that it should take the usual\r\n     course which the practice and laws of this body have given to\r\n     grave public questions. Let it go to the Committee on the\r\n     Judiciary, and let them, under their sense of duty, deal with it\r\n     according to its gravity and importance, and if it be here\r\n     returned let it be passed upon by the grave deliberations of the\r\n     Senate itself. I hope the special committee proposed will not be\r\n     raised, and I trust the Senate will concur with me in thinking\r\n     that the subject should be sent to the Committee on the\r\n     Judiciary.\r\n\r\n     Mr. LOGAN rose.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The morning hour has expired.\r\n\r\n     Mr. LOGAN: I want to say just one word.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: It requires unanimous consent.\r\n\r\n     Mr. LOGAN: I do not wish to make a speech; I merely desire to say\r\n     a word in response to what the senator from Delaware [Mr. Bayard]\r\n     has said in relation to the reference to the Judiciary Committee.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HARRIS: I ask unanimous consent that the senator from\r\n     Illinois may proceed.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: There being no objection unanimous\r\n     consent will be presumed to have been given for the senator from\r\n     Illinois to make his explanation.\r\n\r\n     Mr. LOGAN: This question having been once before the Judiciary\r\n     Committee, and it being a request by many ladies, who are\r\n     citizens of the United States just as we are, that they should\r\n     have a special committee of the Senate before which they can be\r\n     heard, I deem it proper and right, without any committal whatever\r\n     in reference to my own views, that they should have that\r\n     committee. It is nothing but fair, just, and right that they\r\n     should have a committee organized as nearly as can be in the\r\n     Senate in favor of the views they desire to present. It is\r\n     treating them only as other citizens would desire to be treated\r\n     before a body of this character. I am, therefore, opposed to the\r\n     reference of the proposition to the Judiciary Committee, and I\r\n     hope the Senate will give these ladies a special committee where\r\n     they can be heard, and that that committee may be so organized as\r\n     that it will be as favorable to their views as possible, so that\r\n     they may have a fair hearing. That is all I desire to say.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MORRILL: I hope this subject will be concluded this morning,\r\n     otherwise it is to come up constantly and monopolize all the time\r\n     of the morning hour. I do not think it will require many minutes\r\n     more to dispose of it now.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The Chair will entertain a motion on\r\n     that subject.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MORRILL: I move to set aside other business until this\r\n     resolution shall be disposed of. If it should continue any length\r\n     of time of course I would withdraw the suggestion.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The senator from Vermont--\r\n\r\n     Mr. VOORHEES: Mr. President, I feel constrained to call for the\r\n     regular order.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  DECEMBER 19, 1881.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: Are there further \"concurrent or\r\n     other resolutions\"?\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: I call up the resolution in regard to woman suffrage,\r\n     reported by me from the Committee on Rules.\r\n\r\n     Mr. JONES of Florida: I ask for information how long the morning\r\n     hour is to extend?\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The regular business of the morning\r\n     hour is closed. The morning hour, however, will not expire until\r\n     twenty minutes past one. The senator from Massachusetts asks to\r\n     have taken up the resolution reported by him from the Committee\r\n     on Rules.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: I hope we may have a vote on the resolution this\r\n     morning.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The question is on the amendment\r\n     proposed by the senator from Delaware [Mr. Bayard], that the\r\n     subject be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: It is not intended by the resolution to commit the\r\n     Senate, or any senator in the slightest degree to any opinion\r\n     upon the question of woman suffrage, but it is merely the\r\n     question of a convenient mode of hearing. I hope we shall be\r\n     allowed to have a vote on the resolution.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: Is the Senate ready for the question\r\n     on the motion of the senator from Delaware?\r\n\r\n     Mr. BAYARD and Mr. FARLEY called for the yeas and nays, and they\r\n     were ordered.\r\n\r\n     Mr. BECK: Mr. President, I have received a number of\r\n     communications from very respectable ladies in my own State upon\r\n     this important question; but I am unable to comply with their\r\n     request and support the female suffrage which they advocate. I\r\n     shall vote for the reference to the Committee on the Judiciary in\r\n     order that there may be a thorough investigation of the question.\r\n     I wholly disagree with the suggestion of the senator from\r\n     Illinois [Mr. Logan], that a committee ought to be appointed as\r\n     favorable to the views of these ladies as possible. I desire a\r\n     committee that will have no views, for or against them, except\r\n     what is best for the public good. Such a committee I understand\r\n     the Committee on the Judiciary to be.\r\n\r\n     I desire to say only in a word that the difficulty I have and the\r\n     question I desire the Committee on the Judiciary to report upon\r\n     is, the effect of this question upon suffrage. By the fifteenth\r\n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States there can be\r\n     no discrimination made in regard to voting on account of race,\r\n     color or previous condition. Intelligence is properly regarded as\r\n     one of the fundamental principles of fair suffrage. We have been\r\n     compelled in the last ten years to allow all the colored men of\r\n     the South to become voters. There is a mass of ignorance there to\r\n     be absorbed that will take years and years of care in order to\r\n     bring that class up to the standard of intelligent voters. The\r\n     several States are addressing themselves to that task as\r\n     earnestly as possible. Now it is proposed that all the women of\r\n     the country shall vote; that all the colored women of the South,\r\n     who are as much more ignorant than the colored men as it is\r\n     possible to imagine, shall vote. Not one perhaps in a hundred of\r\n     them can read or write. The colored men have had the advantages\r\n     of communication with other men in a variety of forms. Many of\r\n     them have considerable intelligence; but the colored women have\r\n     not had equal chances. Take them from their wash-tubs and their\r\n     household work and they are absolutely ignorant of the new duties\r\n     of voting citizens. The intelligent ladies of the North and the\r\n     West and the South cannot vote without extending that privilege\r\n     to that class of ignorant colored people. I doubt whether any man\r\n     will say that it is safe for the republic now, when we are going\r\n     through the problem we are obliged to solve, to fling in this\r\n     additional mass of ignorance upon the suffrage of the country.\r\n     Why, sir, a rich corporation or a body of men of wealth could buy\r\n     them up for fifty cents apiece, and they would vote without\r\n     knowing what they were doing for the side that paid most. Yet we\r\n     are asked to confer suffrage upon them, and to have a committee\r\n     appointed as favorable to that view as possible, so as to get a\r\n     favorable report upon it!\r\n\r\n     I want the Committee on the Judiciary to tell the congress and\r\n     the country whether they think it is good policy now to confer\r\n     suffrage on all the colored women of the South, ignorant as they\r\n     are known to be, and thus add to the ignorance that we are now\r\n     struggling with, and whether the republic can be sustained upon\r\n     such a basis as that. For that reason, and because I want that\r\n     information from an unbiased committee, because I know that\r\n     suffrage has been degraded sufficiently already, and because it\r\n     would be degraded infinitely more if a report favorable to this\r\n     extension of suffrage should be adopted and passed through\r\n     congress, I am opposed to this movement. No matter if there are a\r\n     number of respectable ladies who are competent to vote and desire\r\n     it to be done, because of the very fact that they cannot be\r\n     allowed this privilege without giving all the mass of ignorant\r\n     colored women in the country the right to vote, thus bringing in\r\n     a mass of ignorance that would crush and degrade the suffrage of\r\n     this country almost beyond conception, I shall vote to refer the\r\n     subject to the Judiciary Committee, and I shall await their\r\n     report with a good deal of anxiety.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MORGAN: Mr. President--\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The morning hour has expired, and\r\n     the unfinished business is before the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  DECEMBER 20, 1881.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: I now call up the resolution for appointing a special\r\n     committee on woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The morning hour having expired, the\r\n     senator from Massachusetts calls up the resolution which was\r\n     under consideration yesterday.\r\n\r\n     Mr. INGALLS: What is the regular order?\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: There is no regular unfinished\r\n     business. The senator from Florida [Mr. Call] gave notice\r\n     yesterday that he would ask the indulgence of the Senate to-day\r\n     to consider the subject of homestead rights.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: I hope this matter may be disposed of. It is very\r\n     unpleasant to me to stand before the Senate in this way, taking\r\n     up its time with this matter in a five minutes' debate every day\r\n     in succession for an unlimited period of time. It is a matter\r\n     which every senator understands. It has nothing to do with the\r\n     merits of the woman suffrage question at all. It is a mere desire\r\n     on the part of these people to have a particular form of hearing,\r\n     which seems to me the most convenient for the Senate, and I hope\r\n     the Senate will be willing to vote on the resolution and let it\r\n     pass.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MORGAN: I have no objection to proceeding to the\r\n     consideration of the resolution, but I desire to address the\r\n     Senate upon it.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: I think I must ask now as a favor of the senator from\r\n     Alabama that he let the resolution be disposed of promptly.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The senator from Alabama states that\r\n     he has no objection to the present consideration of the\r\n     resolution, but he asks leave to make some remarks upon it. The\r\n     Chair hearing no objection to the consideration of the\r\n     resolution, it is before the Senate.\r\n\r\n     Mr. FARLEY: I object to the consideration of the resolution.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: I move to take it up.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The senator from Massachusetts calls\r\n     it up as a matter of right. If a majority of the Senate agree to\r\n     take up the resolution it is before the Senate, and the Chair\r\n     will put the question. The question is on agreeing to the motion\r\n     of the senator from Massachusetts to proceed to the consideration\r\n     of the resolution. [The motion was agreed to; and the Senate\r\n     resumed the consideration of the resolution reported from the\r\n     Committee on Rules by Mr. Hoar on the 13th instant, which was\r\n     read.]\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The pending question is on the\r\n     motion of the senator from Delaware [Mr. Bayard] to refer the\r\n     subject to the Committee on the Judiciary, on which the yeas and\r\n     nays have been ordered.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MORGAN: Mr. President, I stand in a different relation to\r\n     this question from that of the senator from Kentucky [Mr. Beck],\r\n     who said yesterday that he had received a number of\r\n     communications from very respectable ladies in his own State upon\r\n     this very important subject, and yet felt constrained by a sense\r\n     of duty to deny the action which they solicited at the hands of\r\n     congress. I am not informed that any woman from Alabama has ever\r\n     sent a petition to the Senate, or to either house, upon this\r\n     matter. Indeed, it is my impression that no petitions or letters\r\n     have ever been addressed by any lady in the State of Alabama to\r\n     either house of congress upon this question. It may be that that\r\n     peculiar type of civilization which drives women from their homes\r\n     to the ballot-box to seek redress and protection against their\r\n     husbands has never yet reached the State of Alabama, and I shall\r\n     not be disagreeably disappointed if it should never come upon our\r\n     people, for they have lived in harmony and in prosperity now for\r\n     many years. Besides the relief which the State has seen proper to\r\n     give to married women in respect of their separate estates, we\r\n     have not thought it wise or politic in any sense to go further\r\n     and undertake to make a line of demarkation between the husband\r\n     and wife as politicians. On the contrary, according to our\r\n     estimate of a proper civilization, we look to the family relation\r\n     as being the true foundation of our republican institutions.\r\n     Strike out the family relation, disband the family, destroy the\r\n     proper authority of the person at the head of the family, either\r\n     the wife or the husband, and you take from popular government all\r\n     legitimate foundation.\r\n\r\n     The measure which is now brought before the Senate of the United\r\n     States is but the initial measure of a series which has been\r\n     urged upon the attention of States and territories, and upon the\r\n     attention of the Congress of the United States in various forms\r\n     to draw a line of political demarkation through a man's\r\n     household, through his fireside, and to open to the intrusion of\r\n     politics and politicians that sacred circle of the family where\r\n     no man should be permitted to intrude without the consent of both\r\n     the heads of the family. What picture could be more disagreeable\r\n     or more disgusting than to have a pot-house politician introduce\r\n     himself into a gentleman's family, with his wife seated at one\r\n     side of the fireplace and himself at the other, and this man\r\n     coming between to urge arguments why the wife should oppose the\r\n     policy that the husband advocates, or that the husband should\r\n     oppose the policy that the wife advocates?\r\n\r\n     If this measure means anything it is a proposition that the\r\n     Senate of the United States shall first vote to carry into effect\r\n     this unjust and improper intrusion into the home circle. Suppose\r\n     this resolution to raise a select committee should be passed:\r\n     that committee will have its hands full and its ears full of\r\n     petitions and applications and speeches from strong-minded women,\r\n     and of course it must make some report to the Senate; and we\r\n     shall have this subject introduced in here as one that requires a\r\n     peculiar application of the powers of the Senate for its\r\n     digestion and for the completion of the bills and measures\r\n     founded upon it. At the next session of congress this select\r\n     committee will become a standing committee of the Senate, and\r\n     then we shall have that which appears to be the most potential\r\n     and at the same time the most dangerous element in politics\r\n     to-day, agitation, agitation, agitation. It seems that the\r\n     legislators of the United States Government are not to be allowed\r\n     to pass in quiet judgment upon measures of this character, but\r\n     like many other things which are addressing themselves to the\r\n     attention of the people on this side of the water and the other,\r\n     they must all be moved against the Senate and against the House\r\n     by agitation. You raise your committee and allow the agitators to\r\n     come before them, yea, more than that, you invite them to come;\r\n     and what is the result? The Congress of the United States will\r\n     for the next ten or perhaps twenty years be continually assailed\r\n     for special and peculiar legislation in favor of the women of the\r\n     land.\r\n\r\n     I do not understand that a woman in this country has any more\r\n     right to a select committee than a man has. It would be just as\r\n     rational and as proper in every legislative and parliamentary\r\n     sense to have a select committee for the consideration of the\r\n     rights of men as to have a committee for the consideration of the\r\n     rights of women. I object, sir, to this disseverance between the\r\n     sexes, and I object to the Senate of the United States giving its\r\n     sanction in advance or in any way to this character of\r\n     legislation. It is a false principle, and it will work evil, and\r\n     only evil, in this country.\r\n\r\n     What jurisdiction do you expect to exercise in the Senate of the\r\n     United States for the benefit of the women in respect of suffrage\r\n     or in respect of separate estates? Where are the boundaries of\r\n     your jurisdiction? You find them in the territories and in the\r\n     District of Columbia. If you expect to proceed into the States\r\n     you must have the Constitution of the United States amended so as\r\n     to put our wives and our daughters upon the footing of those who\r\n     are provided for in the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments. Your\r\n     jurisdiction is limited to the territories and to the District of\r\n     Columbia.\r\n\r\n     Inasmuch as this measure, I understand, has been made a party\r\n     measure by the decree of a caucus, I propose to make some little\r\n     inquiry into the past legislation of the Congress of the United\r\n     States under Republican rule in respect of the extension of the\r\n     right of suffrage to certain classes of people in this country. I\r\n     will take up first the territories.\r\n\r\n     Let us look for a moment at the result of woman suffrage in some\r\n     of the territories. The territorial legislature of Utah has gone\r\n     forward and conferred the right of suffrage upon women. The\r\n     population in the last decade has reached from 64,000, I believe,\r\n     to about 150,000. The territorial legislature of Utah conferred\r\n     upon the females of that territory the right of suffrage, and how\r\n     have they exercised that right? Sir, I am ashamed to say it, but\r\n     it is known to the world that the power of Mormonism and polygamy\r\n     in Utah territory is sustained by female suffrage. You cannot get\r\n     rid of those laws. Ninety per cent. of the legislative power of\r\n     Utah territory is Mormon and polygamous. If female suffrage is to\r\n     be incorporated into the laws of our country with a view to the\r\n     amelioration of our morals or our political sentiments, we stand\r\n     aghast at the spectacle of what has been wrought by its exercise\r\n     in the territory of Utah. There stands a power supporting the\r\n     crime of polygamy through what they call a divine inspiration, or\r\n     teaching from God, and all the power of the judges of the United\r\n     States and of the Congress of the United States has been\r\n     unavailing to break it down. Who have upheld it? Those who in the\r\n     family circle represent one husband to fifteen women. A continual\r\n     accumulation of the power of the church and of polygamy is going\r\n     on, and when the Gentiles, as they are called, enter that\r\n     territory with the view of breaking it up they are confronted by\r\n     the women, who are allowed to vote, and from whom we should\r\n     naturally expect a better and a higher morality in reference to\r\n     subjects of the kind. But this only shows the power of man over\r\n     woman. It only shows how through her tender affections, her\r\n     delicate sensibilities, and her confiding spirit she can be made\r\n     the very slave and bond-servant of man, and can scarcely ever be\r\n     made an independent participant in the stronger exercise of the\r\n     powers which God seems to have intrusted to him. Never was there\r\n     a picture more disgusting or more condemnatory of the extension\r\n     of the franchise to women as contradistinguished from men than is\r\n     presented in the territory of Utah to-day.\r\n\r\n     Where is the necessity of raising the number of voters in the\r\n     United States from 10,000,000 to 20,000,000? That would be the\r\n     direct effect of conferring suffrage upon the women, for they are\r\n     at least one-half, if not a little more than one-half, of the\r\n     entire population of the country above the age of twenty-one. We\r\n     have now masses of voters so enormous in numbers as that it seems\r\n     to be almost beyond the power of the law to execute the purposes\r\n     of the elective franchise with justice, with propriety, and\r\n     without crime. How much would these difficulties and these\r\n     intrinsic troubles be increased if we should raise the number of\r\n     voters from 10,000,000 to 20,000,000 in the United States? That\r\n     would be the direct and immediate effect of conferring the\r\n     franchise upon the women. What would be the next effect of such\r\n     an extension of the suffrage? It was described by my friend from\r\n     Missouri [Mr. Vest] and by other senators who have spoken upon\r\n     this subject. The effect would be to drive the ladies of the\r\n     land, as they are termed, the well-bred and well-educated women,\r\n     the women of nice sensibilities, within their home circle, there\r\n     to remain, while the ruder of that sex would thrust themselves\r\n     out on the hustings and at the ballot-box, and fight their way to\r\n     the polls through negroes and others who are not the best of\r\n     company even at the polls, to say nothing of the disgrace of\r\n     association with them. You would paralyze one-third at least of\r\n     the women of this land by the very vulgarity of the overture made\r\n     to them that they should go struggling to the polls in order to\r\n     vote in common with the herd of men. They would not undertake it.\r\n     The most intelligent and trustworthy part of the suffrage thus\r\n     placed upon the land would never be available, while that which\r\n     was not worthy of respect either for its character or for its\r\n     information would take the matter in hand and move along in the\r\n     circle of politicians to cast their suffrages at the ballot-box.\r\n\r\n     As the States to be formed out of the territories are admitted\r\n     into the Union, they will come stamped with the characteristics\r\n     which the legislatures of the territories have imprinted upon\r\n     them; and if after due consideration in those territories the men\r\n     who have the regulation of public affairs should come to the\r\n     conclusion that it was best to have woman suffrage, then we can\r\n     allow them, under existing laws, to go on and perfect their\r\n     systems and apply for admission into the Union with them as they\r\n     may choose to adopt them and to shape them. The law upon that\r\n     subject as it exists is liberal enough, for it gives to the\r\n     legislatures the right to regulate the qualifications of\r\n     suffrage. It leaves it to each local community, wherever it may\r\n     be throughout the territories of the United States, to determine\r\n     for itself what it may prefer to have.\r\n\r\n     Is it the object in the raising of this committee only that it\r\n     shall have so many speeches made, so much talk about it, or is it\r\n     to be the object of the committee to have legislation brought\r\n     here? If you bring legislation here, what will you bring? An\r\n     amendment to the constitution like the fourteenth amendment, or\r\n     else some provision obligatory upon the territories by which\r\n     female suffrage shall be allowed there, whether the people want\r\n     it or whether they do not? For my part, before this session of\r\n     congress ends I intend to introduce a bill to repeal woman\r\n     suffrage in the territory of Utah, knowing and believing that\r\n     that will be the most effectual remedy for the extirpation of\r\n     polygamy in that unfortunate territory. If you choose to repeal\r\n     the laws of any territory conferring the right of suffrage upon\r\n     women you have the power in congress to do it; but there are no\r\n     measures introduced here and none advocated in that direction.\r\n     The whole drift of this movement is in the other direction. This\r\n     committee is sought to be raised either for the accommodation of\r\n     some senator who wants a chairmanship and a clerk, or it is\r\n     sought to be raised for the purpose of encouraging a raid on the\r\n     laws and traditions of this country, which I think would end in\r\n     our total demoralization, I therefore oppose this measure in the\r\n     beginning, and I expect to oppose it as far as it may go.\r\n\r\n     Now let us notice for a moment the case of the District of\r\n     Columbia. There are some senators here who have given themselves\r\n     a great deal of trouble in the advocacy of the right of suffrage\r\n     of the people of the United States, and especially of the colored\r\n     people. They put themselves to great trouble, and doubtless at\r\n     some expense of feeling, to worry and beset and harry gentlemen\r\n     who come from certain States of this Union, in reference to the\r\n     votes of the negroes: and yet these very gentlemen have been\r\n     either in this House or in the other when the Republican party\r\n     has had a two-thirds majority of both branches and has\r\n     deliberately taken from the people of the District of Columbia\r\n     the right to elect any officer from a constable to a mayor, all\r\n     because when the experiment was tried here it was found that the\r\n     negroes were a little too strong. There was too much African\r\n     suffrage in the ballot-box, and they must get rid of it, and to\r\n     get rid of it on terms of equality they have disfranchised every\r\n     man in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n     I shall have more faith in the sincerity of the declarations of\r\n     gentlemen of their desire to have the women vote when I see that\r\n     they have made some step toward the restoration of the right of\r\n     suffrage to the people of the District of Columbia. While they\r\n     let this blot remain upon our law, while they allow this damning\r\n     conviction to stand, they may stare us in the face and accuse us\r\n     continually of a want of candor and sincerity on this subject,\r\n     but they will address their arguments to me in vain, even as\r\n     coming from men who have an infatuation upon the subject. I do\r\n     not believe a word of it, Mr. President.\r\n\r\n     I cannot be convinced against these facts that this new movement\r\n     in favor of female suffrage means anything more than to add\r\n     another patch to the worn-out garment of Republicanism, which\r\n     they patched with Mahoneism in Virginia, with repudiation\r\n     elsewhere, and which they now seek to patch further by putting on\r\n     the delicate little silk covering of woman suffrage. I do not\r\n     believe that this movement has its root and branch in any sincere\r\n     desire to give to the women of this land the right of suffrage. I\r\n     think it is a mere party movement with a view of attempting to\r\n     draw into the reach of the Republican party some little support\r\n     from the sympathy and interest they suppose the ladies will take\r\n     in their cause if they should advocate it here. No bill, perhaps,\r\n     is expected to be reported. The committee will sit and listen and\r\n     profess to be charmed and enlightened and instructed by what may\r\n     be said, and then the subject will be passed by without any\r\n     actual effort to secure the passage of a bill.\r\n\r\n     Introduce your bills and let them go to the Judiciary Committee,\r\n     where the rights of men are to be considered as well as the\r\n     rights of women. If this subject is of that pressing national\r\n     importance which senators seem to think it is, it is not to be\r\n     supposed that the Committee on the Judiciary will fail to give it\r\n     profound and early attention. When you bring a select committee\r\n     forward under the circumstances under which this is to be raised,\r\n     you must not expect us to give credit generally to the idea that\r\n     the real purpose is to advance the cause of woman suffrage, but\r\n     rather that the real purpose is to advance the cause of political\r\n     domination in this country. I can see no reason for the raising\r\n     of this select committee, unless it be to furnish some senator,\r\n     as I have remarked, with a clerk and messenger. If that were the\r\n     avowed reason or could even be intimated, I think I should be\r\n     disposed to yield that courtesy to the senator, whoever he might\r\n     be; but I cannot do it under the false pretext that the real\r\n     object is to bring forward measures here for the introduction of\r\n     woman suffrage into the District of Columbia, where we have no\r\n     suffrage, or into the territories, where they have all the\r\n     suffrage that the territorial legislatures see proper to give\r\n     them. I therefore shall oppose the resolution.\r\n\r\n     Mr. BAYARD: I move the that Senate proceed to the consideration\r\n     of executive business. [The motion was agreed to.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  JANUARY 9, 1882.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: I now ask for the consideration of the resolution\r\n     relating to a select committee on woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: There being ten minutes left of the\r\n     morning hour, the senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Hoar] asks for\r\n     the consideration of the resolution relating to woman suffrage.\r\n     The pending question is on the motion of the senator from\r\n     Delaware [Mr. Bayard] to refer the subject-matter to the\r\n     Committee on the Judiciary, on which the yeas and nays have been\r\n     ordered.\r\n\r\n     The principal legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\r\n\r\n     Mr. BUTLER (when Mr. Pugh's name was called): I was requested by\r\n     the senator from Alabama [Mr. Pugh] to announce his pair with the\r\n     senator from New York [Mr. Miller].\r\n\r\n     The roll-call was concluded.\r\n\r\n     Mr. TELLER: On this question I am paired with the senator from\r\n     Alabama [Mr. Morgan]. If the senator from Alabama were present, I\r\n     should vote \"nay.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. MCPHERSON (after having voted in the affirmative): I rise to\r\n     ask the privilege of withdrawing my vote. I am paired with my\r\n     colleague [Mr. Sewell] on all political questions, and this seems\r\n     to have taken a political shape.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The senator from New Jersey\r\n     withdraws his vote.\r\n\r\n     The result was announced--yeas 27, nays 31. So the motion was not\r\n     agreed to.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The question recurs on the adoption\r\n     of the resolution.\r\n\r\n     Mr. EDMUNDS: Let it be read for information. The secretary read\r\n     the resolution.\r\n\r\n     Mr. EDMUNDS: \"Shall\" ought to be stricken out and \"may\" inserted,\r\n     because the Senate ought always to have the power to refer any\r\n     particular measure as it pleases.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: I have no objection to that modification.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The senator from Massachusetts\r\n     accepts the suggestion of the senator from Vermont, and the word\r\n     \"may\" will be substituted for \"shall.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. HILL of Georgia: I wish to say that I have opposed all\r\n     resolutions, whether originating on the other side of the chamber\r\n     or on this side, appointing special committees. They are all\r\n     wrong. They are not founded, in my judgment, on a correct\r\n     principle. There is no necessity to raise a select committee for\r\n     this business. The standing committees of the Senate are ample to\r\n     do everything that it is proposed the select committee asked for\r\n     shall do. The only result of appointing more special committees\r\n     is to have just that many more clerks, just that much more\r\n     expense, just that many more committee-rooms. This is not the\r\n     first time I have opposed the raising of a select committee.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The morning hour has expired, and it\r\n     requires unanimous consent for the senator from Georgia to\r\n     proceed with his remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  JANUARY 21, 1882.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: I move that the Senate proceed with the consideration\r\n     of the resolution.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: If there is no objection, unanimous\r\n     consent will be assumed.\r\n\r\n     Mr. FARLEY and others: I object.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOAR: I move that the Senate proceed with the consideration\r\n     of the resolution.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SHERMAN: Let it be proceeded with informally, subject to the\r\n     call for other business.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The question is on the motion of the\r\n     senator from Massachusetts. [Putting the question.] The Chair is\r\n     uncertain from the sound and will ask for a division.\r\n\r\n     The motion was agreed to; there being on a division--ayes 32,\r\n     noes 20.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The resolution is before the Senate\r\n     and the senator from Georgia [Mr. Hill] has the floor.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HILL of Georgia: Mr. President, I do not intend to say one\r\n     word on the subject of woman suffrage. I shall not get into that\r\n     discussion which was alluded to by the senator from\r\n     Massachusetts. The senator will remember, if he refreshes his\r\n     recollection, that when my late colleague, now no longer a\r\n     senator, made a motion for the appointment of a select committee\r\n     in relation to the inter-oceanic canal, I opposed it distinctly,\r\n     though it came from my colleague, upon the ground that the\r\n     appointment of select committees ought to stop, that it was\r\n     wrong; and I oppose this resolution for the same reason. I voted\r\n     against a resolution to raise a select committee offered by a\r\n     senator on this side of the chamber at the present session, and I\r\n     have voted against all resolutions of that character.\r\n\r\n     No senator, in my judgment, will rise in his place in the Senate\r\n     and say that it is necessary to appoint a special committee to\r\n     consider the matters referred to in the resolution. It is true I\r\n     am a member of the committee, and perhaps ought not to refer to\r\n     it, but we have a standing committee, of which the distinguished\r\n     senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Hoar] is chairman, the Committee\r\n     on Privileges and Elections, that, I take occasion to say, is a\r\n     very proper committee for this matter to go to; and that\r\n     committee has almost nothing on earth to do. There is but one\r\n     single subject-matter now before it, and I believe there will be\r\n     scarcely another question before that committee at this session.\r\n     There is not a contested election; there is not a dispute about\r\n     anybody's seat; and yet it is a Committee on Privileges and\r\n     Elections. What is the reason for going on continually and\r\n     appointing these select committees, when there are standing\r\n     committees here, properly organized to consider the very question\r\n     specified by the resolution, with nothing to do?\r\n\r\n     Now, I am going to say one other thing, I do not pretend that the\r\n     purpose I am now about to state is the purpose of the senator\r\n     from Massachusetts. I have no reflections to make as to what this\r\n     resolution is intended for, but we do know that there is an idea\r\n     abroad that select committees are generally appointed for the\r\n     purpose of giving somebody a chairmanship, that somebody may have\r\n     a clerk. That is not the case here, I dare say. I do not mean to\r\n     intimate that it is the case here, but it ought to be put a stop\r\n     to; it is all wrong. I think, though, that there ought to be a\r\n     resolution passed by this body giving every senator who has not a\r\n     committee a clerk. Everybody knows that every chairman of a\r\n     committee has a clerk in the clerk of that committee. The other\r\n     senators, at least in my opinion, ought each to have a clerk. I\r\n     would vote for such a resolution. I believe it would be right,\r\n     and I believe the country would approve it. Every senator knows\r\n     that he has more business to attend to here than he can possibly\r\n     perform. Why, sir, if I were to attend to all the business in the\r\n     departments and otherwise that my constituents ask me to perform,\r\n     I could not discharge half my duties in this chamber; and every\r\n     senator, I dare say, has the same experience. It is to the\r\n     public interest, therefore, in my judgment, that every senator\r\n     should have a clerk. I am unable to employ a clerk from my own\r\n     funds; many other senators are more fortunately situated; but\r\n     still I must do that or move the appointment of a special\r\n     committee for the purpose in an indirect way of getting a clerk.\r\n     It is not right.\r\n\r\n     It has been said that if senators each have a clerk, for\r\n     instance, a clerk at $100 a month salary during the session,\r\n     which would be a very small matter, the members of the other\r\n     House would each want a clerk. It does not follow. There is a\r\n     vast difference. A member of the other House represents a narrow\r\n     district, a single district; a senator represents a whole State.\r\n     Take the State of New York. There are thirty-three\r\n     representatives in the House from the State of New York; there\r\n     are but two senators here from that State. Those two senators in\r\n     all likelihood have as much business to perform here for their\r\n     constituents as the thirty-three members of the House. There is,\r\n     therefore, an eminent reason why a senator should have a clerk\r\n     and why a member of the House should not.\r\n\r\n     I cannot vote for the appointment of select committees unless you\r\n     raise a select committee for every senator in the body so as to\r\n     give him a clerk. You have appointed select committees for this\r\n     business and for that. It gives a few men an advantage when the\r\n     business of the country does not require it, whereas if you\r\n     appointed a clerk for each senator, with a nominal salary of $100\r\n     per month during the session, it would enable every senator to do\r\n     his work more efficiently both here and for his constituents; it\r\n     would put all the senators on a just equality; it would be in\r\n     furtherance of the public interest; and it would avoid what I\r\n     consider (with all due deference and not meaning to be offensive)\r\n     the unseemly habit of constantly moving the appointment of select\r\n     committees in this body. This is all I have to say. I vote\r\n     against the resolution simply because I am opposed to the\r\n     appointment of a select committee for this or any other purpose\r\n     that I can now think of.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: The question is on the adoption of\r\n     the resolution.\r\n\r\n     Mr. VEST called for the yeas and nays, and they were ordered, and\r\n     the principal legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\r\n\r\n     Mr. JONES of Florida (when his name was called): I propose to\r\n     vote for this resolution, but at the same time I do not regard my\r\n     vote as in any way committing myself on the subject of female\r\n     suffrage. If they think an investigation of this subject should\r\n     be had in this way, I for one am willing to have it. I vote\r\n     \"yea.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. TELLER, (when his name was called): On this question I am\r\n     paired with the senator from Alabama [Mr. Morgan]; otherwise I\r\n     should vote \"yea.\"\r\n\r\n     The roll-call having been concluded, the result was\r\n     announced--yeas 35, nays 23; so the resolution was agreed\r\n     to.[82]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, December 20, 1881.\r\n\r\n     Mr. WHITE of Kentucky: I ask consent to offer for consideration\r\n     at this time the resolution which I send to the clerk's desk.\r\n\r\n     The clerk read as follows:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That a select committee of seven members of the\r\n          House of Representatives be appointed by the Speaker, to\r\n          whom shall be referred all petitions, bills and resolves\r\n          providing for the extension of suffrage to women, or for the\r\n          removal of legal disabilities.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MILLS of Texas: I object.\r\n\r\n     Mr. KELLEY of Pennsylvania: A similar resolution has already been\r\n     referred to the Committee on Rules.\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER (Mr. Keifer of Ohio): Objection being made to its\r\n     consideration at this time, the resolution will be referred to\r\n     the Committee on Rules.\r\n\r\n     The resolution was referred accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, February 25, 1882.\r\n\r\n     Mr. REED of Maine: I rise to make a privileged report. The\r\n     Committee on Rules, to whom were referred sundry resolutions\r\n     relating to the subject, have instructed me to report the\r\n     resolution which I send to the desk.\r\n\r\n     The clerk read as follows:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That a select committee of nine members be\r\n          appointed, to whom shall be referred all petitions, bills\r\n          and resolves asking for the extension of suffrage to women\r\n          or the removal of their legal disabilities.\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: The question is on the adoption of the report of the\r\n     Committee on Rules.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOLMAN of Indiana: I ask that the latter portion of the\r\n     resolution be again read. It was not heard in this part of the\r\n     house.\r\n\r\n     The resolution was again read.\r\n\r\n     Mr. TOWNSHEND of Illinois: I rise to make a parliamentary\r\n     inquiry.\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: The gentleman will state it.\r\n\r\n     Mr. TOWNSHEND: My inquiry is whether that resolution should not\r\n     go to the House calendar.\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: It is a privileged report under the rules of the\r\n     House from the Committee on Rules. The question is on the\r\n     adoption of the resolution.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MCMILLIN of Tennessee: I make the point of order that it must\r\n     lie over for one day.\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: It is the report of a committee privileged under the\r\n     rules.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MCMILLIN: The committee are privileged to report, but under\r\n     the rule the report has to lie over a day.\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: The gentleman from Tennessee will oblige the Chair\r\n     by directing his attention to any rule which requires such a\r\n     report to lie over one day. It changes no standing rule or order\r\n     of the House.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MCMILLIN: It does, by making a change in the number and\r\n     nature of the committees. All measures of a particular class, the\r\n     resolution states, must be referred to the proposed committee,\r\n     whereas heretofore they have been referred to a different\r\n     committee. Therefore the resolution changes the rules of the\r\n     House.\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: The Chair is of opinion the resolution does not\r\n     rescind or change any standing rule of the House. The question is\r\n     on the adoption of the resolution.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SPRINGER: Mr. Speaker, I desire to call the attention of the\r\n     Chair to the fact that this does distinctly change one of the\r\n     standing rules of the House. One of the standing rules is--\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: The Chair has passed on that question, and no appeal\r\n     has been taken from his decision.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SPRINGER: I desire to call the attention of the Chair to Rule\r\n     10, which specifically provides for the appointment of the full\r\n     number of committees this House is to have, and this is not one\r\n     of them.\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: Not one of the standing committees, but a select\r\n     committee.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SPRINGER: That rule provides there shall be a certain number\r\n     of committees, the names of which are therein given.\r\n\r\n     Mr. REED: I sincerely hope this will not be made a matter of\r\n     technical discussion or debate. It is a matter upon which members\r\n     of this House must have opinions which they can express by\r\n     voting, in a very short time, without taking up the attention of\r\n     the House beyond what is really necessary for a bare discussion\r\n     of the merits of the question.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MCMILLIN: Will the gentleman permit me to ask him a question?\r\n\r\n     Mr. REED: Certainly.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MCMILLIN: Would you not, as a parliamentarian, concede that\r\n     this does change the existing rules of the House?\r\n\r\n     Mr. REED: By no manner of means, especially when the accomplished\r\n     Speaker has decided the other way, and no gentleman has taken an\r\n     appeal from his decision. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n     Mr. MCMILLIN: Then you have no opinion beyond his decision?\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: The Chair will state to the gentleman from Illinois\r\n     [Mr. Springer] that this resolution does not change any of the\r\n     standing committees of the House which are provided for in Rule\r\n     10.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SPRINGER: It provides for a new committee.\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: It provides for a select committee. The subject was\r\n     referred to the Committee on Rules by order of the House, and\r\n     this is a report on the resolution so referred.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SPRINGER: The rule provides that no standing rule or order of\r\n     the House shall be rescinded or changed without one day's notice.\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: The Chair would decide that this does not propose\r\n     any change or rescinding of any standing rule of the House.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SPRINGER: Does the Chair hold that the making of a new rule\r\n     is not a change of the existing rules?\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: The Chair does not decide anything of the kind.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SPRINGER: What does the Chair decide?\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: The Chair does not undertake to decide any such\r\n     question, for it is not now presented.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SPRINGER: Is this not a new rule?\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: It is not.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SPRINGER: It is not?\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: It is a provision for a select committee.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SPRINGER: Can you have a committee without a rule of the\r\n     House providing for it?\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: The question is on the adoption of the resolution\r\n     reported from the Committee on Rules.\r\n\r\n     Mr. ATKINS: On that question I call for the yeas and nays.\r\n\r\n     The yeas and nays were ordered.\r\n\r\n     The question was taken and there were--yeas 115, nays 84, not\r\n     voting 93; so the resolution was carried.[83]\r\n\r\n     Mr. REED moved to reconsider the vote by which the resolution was\r\n     adopted; and also moved that the motion to reconsider be laid on\r\n     the table. The latter motion was agreed to.\r\n\r\n     On Monday, March 13, 1882, the Chair announced the appointment of\r\n     the following gentlemen as the Select Committee on Woman Suffrage\r\n     authorized by the House: Mr. Camp of New York, Mr. White of\r\n     Kentucky, Mr. Sherwin of Illinois, Mr. Stone of Massachusetts,\r\n     Mr. Hepburn of Iowa, Mr. Springer of Illinois, Mr. Vance of North\r\n     Carolina, Mr. Muldrow of Mississippi and Mr. Stockslager of\r\n     Indiana.\r\n\r\nThe Annual Washington Convention was held in Lincoln Hall as usual,\r\nJanuary 18, 19, 20, 1882. The afternoon before the convention, at\r\nan executive session held at the Riggs House, forty delegates were\r\npresent from fourteen different States.[84] Among these were five\r\nfrom Massachusetts, and for the first time that State was\r\nrepresented on the platform of the National Association. Mrs.\r\nStanton gave the opening address, and made some amusing criticisms\r\non a recent debate on Senator Hoar's proposition for a special\r\ncommittee on the rights and disabilities of women. Such a committee\r\nhad been under debate for several years and it was during this\r\nconvention that the bill passed the Senate.\r\n\r\nInvitations to attend the convention were sent to all the members\r\nof congress, and many were present during the various sessions.\r\nMiss Ellen H. Sheldon, secretary, read the minutes of the last\r\nconvention, and, instead of the usual dry skeleton of facts, she\r\ngave a glowing description of that eventful occasion. Clara B.\r\nColby gave an interesting narration of the progress of woman\r\nsuffrage in Nebraska, and of the efforts being made to carry the\r\nproposition pending before the people, to strike the word \"male\"\r\nfrom the constitution in the coming November election.\r\n\r\nRev. Frederick A. Hinckley of Providence, R. I., spoke upon \"Our\r\nDemand in the Light of Evolution.\" He said:\r\n\r\n     It is about a century since our forefathers declared that\r\n     \"governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\r\n     governed,\" and about a half century since woman began to see that\r\n     she ought to be included in this declaration. At present the\r\n     expressions of the Declaration of Independence are a \"glittering\r\n     generality,\" for only one-half of the people \"consent.\" Modern\r\n     science has demonstrated the truth of evolution--like causes\r\n     produce like results--and this is seen in the progress of\r\n     government and of woman. From the time when physical force ruled,\r\n     up to the present, when _ostensibly_ in the United States every\r\n     person is his own ruler, there have been many steps. The\r\n     importance of the masses has steadily taken the place of the\r\n     importance of individuals. At first the idea was \"You shall obey\r\n     because I say so\"; then, \"You shall obey because I am your\r\n     superior, and will protect you\"; now it is \"Everyone shall be his\r\n     own protector.\" But we do not live up to this idea while only\r\n     one-half instead of the whole of \"everyone\" is his own protector.\r\n     The phases of woman's advancement are fitly described by the four\r\n     words--slave, subject, inferior, dependent; and no step in this\r\n     advance has been accomplished without a hard struggle. The logic\r\n     of evolution in government points to universal suffrage. The same\r\n     logic points to unqualified individual freedom for woman.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blake in reporting from her State said:\r\n\r\n     Governor Cornell was the first New York Governor to mention woman\r\n     in an inaugural address, and the bill allowing women to vote in\r\n     school elections was passed the same winter. There was a great\r\n     deal of opposition in different parts of the State to the voting\r\n     of women. In some country districts where the polls are in the\r\n     school-houses, certain men went early and locked the doors,\r\n     filled the room with smoke and even put tobacco on the stoves to\r\n     make it as disagreeable for the women as possible. More\r\n     respectable men had to ventilate and clean the rooms to make them\r\n     decent for either man or woman. From this lowest class of\r\n     opponents up to those who say: \"My dear, you'd better not make\r\n     yourself conspicuous!\" the spirit is the same. Believing that\r\n     under our constitution women are already entitled to the ballot,\r\n     we do not ask for a constitutional amendment, but for a bill\r\n     extending the suffrage at once.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. COLBY in contrast to this stated that in Nebraska the\r\n     greatest courtesy had always been shown to women who voted at\r\n     school elections. There is only one organized effort against\r\n     woman suffrage, and that is made by the \"Sons of Liberty!\" \"O,\r\n     Consistency, thou art a jewel!\"\r\n\r\nThe following resolution introduced into the Senate, January 11, by\r\nMr. Morgan of Alabama, was finally referred to the Committee on\r\nWoman Suffrage. This was the first subject brought before them for\r\naction.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the committee on \"The extension of suffrage\r\n          to women, or the removal of their disabilities,\" be directed\r\n          to examine into the state of the law regulating the right of\r\n          suffrage in the territory of Utah, and report a bill to set\r\n          aside and annul any law or laws enacted by the legislature\r\n          of said territory conferring upon women the right of\r\n          suffrage.\r\n\r\nMiss Couzins made an admirable speech on the following resolution:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That Senator Morgan's bill to deprive the\r\n          _women_ of Utah of the right of suffrage because of the\r\n          social institutions and religious faith originated and\r\n          maintained by the _men_ of the territory, is a travesty on\r\n          common justice. While the wife has not absolute possession\r\n          of even one husband, and the husband has many wives, surely\r\n          the men and not the women, if either, should be deprived of\r\n          the suffrage.\r\n\r\n     Miss COUZINS said: The task of dealing fairly and justly with\r\n     this territorial complication should never be committed to the\r\n     blundering legislation of man alone. His success as a legislator\r\n     and executive for woman in the past does not inspire a confidence\r\n     that in this most serious problem he will be any the less an\r\n     unbiased judge and law-giver. This government of men permitted\r\n     the establishment of a religious colony, so called, whose basis\r\n     of faith was the complete humiliation of women; recognized the\r\n     system by appointing its chief, Brigham Young, governor of the\r\n     territory, under whose fostering care polygamy grew to its\r\n     present proportions.\r\n\r\n     That woman has not thrown off the yoke of religious despotism can\r\n     be readily appreciated when we recognize the fact that man, from\r\n     time immemorial, has played upon her religious faith to exalt his\r\n     own attributes and degrade hers; that through this teaching her\r\n     abiding belief in his superior capacity to interpret scriptural\r\n     truths for her has been the means of sacrificing her power of\r\n     mind, her tender affections, her delicate sensibilities, on the\r\n     altar of his base selfishness throughout the ages. Orthodoxy\r\n     recognizes no \"inspiration\" for woman to-day. She is not \"called\"\r\n     save to serve man. Under its teaching her thought has been\r\n     padlocked in the name of Divinity, and her lips sealed in\r\n     sacrilegious pretense of authority from heaven; and nothing so\r\n     clearly bespeaks the degenerating influence of the ages of this\r\n     masculine teaching as the absolute faith manifested by the women\r\n     of Utah in this _ipse dixit_ of man's religious doctrine. Their\r\n     emancipation must necessarily be slow.\r\n\r\n     The paternal government allowed polygamy to be planted, take\r\n     root, and grow in a wilderness where the attraction of nobler\r\n     minds and freer thoughts was not known. The victims came from the\r\n     political despotisms of the old world to be shackled in a land of\r\n     freedom with a still darker despotism, and under the aegis of the\r\n     American flag they have borne children as a religious duty they\r\n     owed to God and man; and surely it can not be expected, even with\r\n     that grand emancipator, from king and priestcraft rule, the\r\n     ballot, that at once they will vote themselves outcast and their\r\n     children illegitimate.\r\n\r\n     It took the white men of this nation one hundred years to put\r\n     away that relic of barbarism, slavery; the removal of the twin\r\n     relic will come through liberty for woman, higher education for\r\n     children, and the incoming tide of Gentile immigration. The\r\n     fitting act of justice is not disfranchisement of woman, as\r\n     Senator Morgan proposes, and the reenactment of that old Adamic\r\n     cry: \"The woman whom thou gavest,\" but the disfranchisement of\r\n     man, who is the only polygamist, and the stepping down and out of\r\n     the sex as a legislator under whose fostering care this evil has\r\n     grown. Retire to your sylvan groves and academic shades,\r\n     gentlemen, as Mrs. Stanton suggests, and let the Deborahs, the\r\n     Huldahs, and the Vashtis come to the front, and let us see what\r\n     we can do toward the remedy of your wretched legislation. But\r\n     suffrage for women in Utah has accomplished great good. I spent\r\n     one week there in close observation. Outside of their religious\r\n     convictions, the women are emphatic in condemnation of wrong.\r\n     Their votes banished the liquor saloon. I saw no drunkenness\r\n     anywhere; the poison of tobacco smoke is not allowed to vitiate\r\n     the air of heaven, either on the streets or in public assemblies.\r\n     Their court-room was a model of neatness and good order. Plants\r\n     were in the windows and handsome carpets graced the floor. During\r\n     my stay, the daughter of a Mormon, the then advocate-general of\r\n     the territory, was admitted to the bar by Chief-Justice McKean of\r\n     the United States Court, who, in fitting and beautiful language,\r\n     welcomed her to the profession as a woman whose knowledge of the\r\n     law fitted her to be the peer of any man in his court. She told\r\n     me that she detested polygamy, but felt that she could render\r\n     greater service to the emancipation of her sex inside of Utah\r\n     than out. At midnight I wandered, with one of my own sex, about\r\n     the streets to test the assertion that it was as safe for women\r\n     then as at mid-day. No bacchanalian shout rent the air; no man\r\n     was seen reeling in maudlin imbecility to his home. No guardians\r\n     put in an appearance, save the stars above our heads; no sound\r\n     awoke the stillness but the purling of the mountain brooks which\r\n     washed the streets in cleanliness and beauty. What other city on\r\n     this continent can present such a showing? With murder for man\r\n     and rapine for woman where man alone is maker and guardian of the\r\n     laws, it behooves him to pause ere he launches invectives at the\r\n     one result of woman's votes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gougar, on our Washington platform for the first time,\r\ndelighted the audience with her readiness and wit. She has a good\r\nvoice, fine presence, and speaks fluently, without notes.\r\n\r\n     She spoke of the reformatory prison for women in her State, and\r\n     said that the statistics showed that eighty-two per cent. of the\r\n     women confined there were sent out reformed. Speaking of the\r\n     gallantry of men, she cited a case of a man who came to an\r\n     Indiana lawyer and desired him to make a will. The following\r\n     conversation ensued: \"I want you to make this will so that my\r\n     wife will have $400 a year; that's enough for any woman.\" \"Is she\r\n     the only wife you ever had?\" \"Yes.\" \"How long have you been\r\n     married?\" \"Forty-two years.\" \"How many children have you had?\"\r\n     \"Eleven.\" \"Did you have all your property before marriage?\" \"No;\r\n     didn't have a cent; I've earned it all.\" \"Has your wife helped\r\n     you in any way to earn it?\" \"Why, yes, I suppose she has; but\r\n     then I want to fix my will so she can only have $400 a year; it's\r\n     enough.\" \"Well, sir, you will have to move out of the State of\r\n     Indiana then, for the law provides for the wife better than that,\r\n     and you will have to get another lawyer.\" It is needless to say\r\n     that this lawyer is a staunch champion of woman suffrage, and it\r\n     is pleasant to know that there are more such men being educated\r\n     by this agitation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maxwell gave a fine recitation of \"The Dying Soldier,\" at one\r\nof the evening sessions. It was evident by the sparkling eyes of\r\nthe Indiana delegation that the ladies had in reserve some pleasant\r\nsurprise for the convention, which at last revealed itself in the\r\nperson of Judge Orth, a live member of congress from Indiana, who\r\nstood up like a man and avowed his belief in woman suffrage. His\r\nwords were few but to the point, and his hearers all knew exactly\r\nwhere he stood on the question.\r\n\r\nThe next evening the Nebraska delegation, determining not to be\r\noutdone, captured one of their United States senators and\r\ntriumphantly brought him on the platform. It was a point gained to\r\nhave a congressman publicly give in his adhesion to the question,\r\nbut how much greater the achievement to appear in the convention\r\nwith a United States senator. It was a proud moment for Mrs. Colby\r\nwhen Senator Saunders, a large man of fine proportions, stepped to\r\nthe front. But alas! her triumph over the Indiana ladies was short\r\nindeed, for while the senator surpassed the representative in size\r\nand official honors, he fell far below him in the logic of his\r\nstatements and the earnestness of his principles. In fact the\r\naudience and the platform were in doubt at the close of his remarks\r\nas to his true position on the question. Mrs. May Wright Sewall,\r\nwho followed him, sparkled with the satisfaction she expressed in\r\npaying most glowing tributes to the men of Indiana and their State\r\ninstitutions. She said:\r\n\r\n     The principal objection to woman suffrage has always been that it\r\n     will take women from their homes and destroy all home life. She\r\n     showed that there is not an interest of home which is not\r\n     represented in the State, and that the subordination of the State\r\n     to the family has kept pace with the subordination of physical to\r\n     spiritual force. Woman has an interest in everything which\r\n     affects the State, and only lacks the legitimate instrument of\r\n     these interests--the ballot--with which to enforce them. Life\r\n     regulates legislation. Domestic life is woman's sphere, but a\r\n     sphere of much larger dimensions than has ever yet been accorded\r\n     it, these dimensions reaching out and controlling the functions\r\n     of the State. The ballot is not a political or a military, but a\r\n     domestic necessity.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harriette R. Shattuck spoke on the golden rule, asking men to\r\nput themselves in the place of disfranchised women, and then\r\nlegislate for them as they would be legislated for. Mrs. Robinson\r\ngave a resume of the legal, political and educational position of\r\nwomen in Massachusetts. Mrs. Hooker showed that political equality\r\nwould dignify woman in home life, give added weight to her opinions\r\non all questions, and command new respect for her from all classes\r\nof men. Mrs. Colby gave an interesting address on \"The Social\r\nEvolution of Woman\":\r\n\r\n     She traced the history of woman from the time when she was bought\r\n     and sold, up to the present. She said that the first believer in\r\n     woman's rights was the one who first proposed that women should\r\n     be allowed to eat with their husbands. This once granted,\r\n     everything else has followed of necessity, and the ballot will be\r\n     the crowning right. Once women were not allowed to sing soprano\r\n     because it was the \"governing part.\" From these and many like\r\n     indignities woman has gradually evolved until she now stands on\r\n     an equality with man in many social rights.\r\n\r\nMartha McClellan Brown read an able essay on \"The Power of the\r\nVeto.\" She is a woman of fine presence, pleasing manners and a well\r\ntrained voice that can fill any hall. Her address was one of the\r\nbest in the convention and all felt that in her we had a valuable\r\nacquisition to our Association. Mrs. Gage gave an able address on\r\n\"The Moral Force of Woman Suffrage.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the first day of the convention a request, signed by the\r\nofficers of the association, was sent to the Special Committee on\r\nWoman Suffrage in the Senate, asking for a hearing on the sixteenth\r\namendment to the constitution. The hearing was granted on Friday\r\nmorning, January 20, 1882. A distinguished speaker in England\r\nhaving advised the friends of suffrage there to employ young and\r\nattractive women to advocate the measure, as the speediest means of\r\nsuccess, Miss Anthony took the hint in making the selection for the\r\nfirst hearing before the committee of those who had never been\r\nheard before,[85] of whom some were young, and all attractive as\r\nspeakers. Miss Anthony said that she would introduce some new\r\nspeakers to the committee, in order to disprove the allegation that\r\n\"it was always the same old set.\" The committee listened to them\r\nwith undivided attention throughout, and at the conclusion of the\r\nhearing the following resolution, offered by Senator George of\r\nMississippi, was adopted unanimously:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the committee are under obligations to the\r\n          representatives of the women of the United States for their\r\n          attendance this morning, and for the able and instructive\r\n          addresses which have been made, and that the committee\r\n          assure them that they will give to the subject of woman\r\n          suffrage the careful and impartial consideration which its\r\n          grave importance demands.\r\n\r\nIn describing the occasion for the _Boston Transcript_, Mrs.\r\nShattuck said:\r\n\r\n     As we stood in the committee-room and presented our plea for\r\n     freedom, we felt that at last we had obtained a fair hearing,\r\n     whatever its result might be. And the most encouraging sign of\r\n     the impression made by our words was the change in the faces of\r\n     some of the members of the committee as the speaking went on. At\r\n     first there was a look of indifference and scorn--merely\r\n     toleration; this gradually changed to interest mingled with\r\n     surprise; finally, as Miss Anthony closed with one of her most\r\n     eloquent appeals, all the faces showed a decided and almost eager\r\n     interest in what we had to say. Senator George, who certainly\r\n     looked more unpropitious than any other one, assured the ladies\r\n     that he would give to the subject of woman suffrage that careful\r\n     and impartial consideration which its grave importance demands.\r\n     This, from one who heralded his entrance by inquiring of Miss\r\n     Anthony, in stentorian tones, if she \"wanted to go to war,\" was,\r\n     to say the least, a concession. The speakers were closely\r\n     questioned by some members of the committee, who afterwards told\r\n     us \"that they had never heard a speech on the subject before and\r\n     were surprised to find so much in the demand, and to see such\r\n     ability as was manifested by the women before them.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee having expressed a wish to hear others on the\r\nsubject, appointed the next morning at 10 o'clock.[86] Mrs.\r\nStanton, being introduced by the chairman, said:\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen, when the news of the appointment of this committee was\r\n     flashed over the wires, you cannot imagine the satisfaction that\r\n     thrilled the hearts of your countrywomen. After fourteen years of\r\n     constant petitioning, we are grateful for even this slight\r\n     recognition at last. I never before felt such an interest in any\r\n     congressional committee, and I have no doubt that all who are\r\n     interested in this reform, share in my feelings. Fortunately your\r\n     names make a great couplet in rhyme,\r\n\r\n          Lapham, Anthony and Blair,\r\n          Jackson, George, Ferry and Fair.\r\n\r\n     which will enable us to remember them always. This I discovered\r\n     in writing your names in this volume, which allow me to present\r\n     you.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen rising in turn received with a gracious bow \"The\r\nHistory of Woman Suffrage\" which, Mrs. Stanton told them, would\r\nfurnish all the arguments they needed to defend their clients\r\nagainst the ignorance and prejudice of the world. Mr. George of\r\nMississippi asked why this agitation was confined to Northern\r\nwomen; he had never heard the ladies of the South express the wish\r\nto vote. Mrs. Stanton referred him to those to whom the volume\r\nbefore him was dedicated. \"There,\" said she, \"you will find the\r\nnames of two ladies from one of the most distinguished families in\r\nSouth Carolina, who came North over forty years ago, and set this\r\nball for woman's freedom in motion. But for those noble women,\r\nSarah and Angelina Grimke, we might not stand here to-day pleading\r\nfor justice and equality.\" As the speakers had requested the\r\ncommittee to ask questions, they were frequently interrupted. All\r\nurged the importance of a national protection, preferring\r\ncongressional action, to submitting the proposition to the popular\r\nvote of the several States. On this point Mr. Jackson of Tennessee\r\nasked many pertinent questions. Mrs. Shattuck, writing of this\r\noccasion to the _Boston Transcript_, said:\r\n\r\n     One of the speakers eloquently testified to the interest of many\r\n     Southern women in this subject, and urged the Southern members of\r\n     the committee not to declare that the women of the South do not\r\n     want the ballot until they have investigated the matter. After\r\n     the hearing three Southern ladies, wives of congressmen, thanked\r\n     her for what she had said. The member from Mississippi showed a\r\n     great deal of interest and really became quite waked up before\r\n     the session ended. But, when we look at it in one light, there is\r\n     something exceedingly humiliating in the thought that women\r\n     representing the best intellect and the highest morality of our\r\n     country, should come here in their grand old age and ask men for\r\n     that which is theirs by right. Is it not time that this\r\n     aristocracy of sex should be overthrown? Several of the senators\r\n     were so moved by the speeches that they personally expressed\r\n     their thanks, and one who has long been friendly, said the\r\n     speeches were far above the average committee-hearings on any\r\n     subject. We might well have replied that the reason is because\r\n     all the speakers feel what they say and know that the question is\r\n     one of vital importance.\r\n\r\n     In securing these hearings before this special committee of the\r\n     Senate the friends feel they have reached a milestone in the\r\n     progress of their reform. To secure the attention for four hours\r\n     of seven representative men of the United States, must have more\r\n     effect than would a hundred times that amount of time and labor\r\n     expended upon their constituents. If one of these senators, for\r\n     instance, should become convinced of the justice of woman's claim\r\n     to the ballot, his constituency would begin to look upon that\r\n     question with respect, whereas it would take years to bring that\r\n     same constituency up to the position where they could elect such\r\n     a representative. To convince the representatives is to sound the\r\n     keynote, and it is for this reason that these hearings before the\r\n     Senate committee are of such paramount importance to the suffrage\r\n     cause.\r\n\r\n     At the close of the hearing Mrs. Robinson presented each member\r\n     of the committee with her little volume, \"Massachusetts in the\r\n     Woman Suffrage Movement.\"\r\n\r\nJanuary 23 the House Committee on Rules[87] gave a hearing to Mrs.\r\nJane Graham Jones of Chicago, Mrs. May Wright Sewall and Miss\r\nAnthony. During this congress the question of admitting the\r\nterritory of Dakota as a State was discussed in the Senate. Our\r\ncommittee stood ready to oppose it unless the word \"male\" were\r\nstricken from the proposed constitution.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this most of the speakers went[88] to\r\nPhiladelphia where Rachel Foster had made arrangements for a\r\ntwo-days convention. Rev. Charles G. Ames gave the address of\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n     He told of his conversion to woman suffrage from the time when he\r\n     believed women and men were ordained to be unequal, just as in\r\n     nature the mountain is different from the valley--he looking down\r\n     at her, she gazing up at him--until the time when he began to see\r\n     that women are not of necessity the valleys, nor men of necessity\r\n     the mountains; and so on, until now he believes women entitled\r\n     to stand on an equal plane with men, socially and politically.\r\n\r\nThe President, Mrs. Stanton, responded. Hannah Whitehall Smith of\r\nGermantown, prominent in the temperance movement, spoke of the\r\nhardship of farmers' wives, and asked:\r\n\r\n     If that condition was not one of slavery which obliged a woman to\r\n     rise early and cook the family breakfast while her husband lay in\r\n     bed; to work all day long, and then in the evening, while he\r\n     smoked his pipe or enjoyed himself at the corner grocery, to mend\r\n     and patch his old clothes. But she thought the position of woman\r\n     was changing for the better. Even among the Indians a better\r\n     feeling is beginning to prevail. It is Indian etiquette for the\r\n     man to kill the deer or bear, and leave it on the spot where it\r\n     is struck down for the woman to carry home. She must drag it over\r\n     the ground or carry it on her back as best she may, while he\r\n     quietly awaits her coming in the family wigwam. A certain Indian,\r\n     after observing that white folks did differently by their women,\r\n     once resolved to follow their example. But such was the force of\r\n     public opinion that, when it was discovered that he brought home\r\n     his own game, both he and his wife were murdered. This shows what\r\n     fearful results prejudice may bring about; and the only\r\n     difference between the prejudice which ruled his tribe in regard\r\n     to woman and that which rules white American men to-day, is a\r\n     difference in degree, dependent upon the difference in\r\n     enlightenment. The principle is the same. The result would be the\r\n     same were each equally ignorant.\r\n\r\nThe familiar faces of Edward M. Davis, Mary Grew, Adeline Thompson,\r\nSarah Pugh, Anna McDowell and two of Lucretia Mott's noble\r\ndaughters, gladdened many a heart during the various sessions of\r\nthe convention. Beautiful tributes were paid to Mrs. Mott by\r\nseveral of the speakers. The Philadelphia convention was\r\nsupplemented by a most delightful social gathering, without mention\r\nof which a report of the occasion would be incomplete:\r\n\r\n     Like many historical events, this was entirely unpremeditated, no\r\n     one who participated in its pleasures had any forewarning, aside\r\n     from an informal invitation to lunch with Mrs. Hannah Whitehall\r\n     Smith and her generous husband, both earnest friends of\r\n     temperance and important allies of the woman suffrage movement.\r\n     Mrs. Smith met the guests at the station in Philadelphia, tickets\r\n     in hand, marshaling them to their respective seats in the cars as\r\n     if born to command, and on arriving at Germantown, transferred\r\n     them to carriages in waiting, with the promptness of a railroad\r\n     official. Without noise or confusion one and all crossed the\r\n     threshold of her well-ordered mansion, and with other invited\r\n     guests were soon seated in the spacious parlor, talking in groups\r\n     here and there. \"Ah!\" said Mrs. Smith on entering, \"this will\r\n     never do, think of all the good things that will be lost in these\r\n     side talks. My plan is to have a general conversation, a kind of\r\n     love-feast, each telling her experience. It would be pleasant to\r\n     know how each has reached the same platform, through the tangled\r\n     labyrinths of human life.\" Soon all was silence and one after\r\n     another related the special incidents in childhood, girlhood and\r\n     mature years that had turned her thoughts to the consideration of\r\n     woman's position. The stories were as varied as they were\r\n     pathetic and amusing, and were listened to amidst smiles and\r\n     tears with the deepest interest. And when all[89] had finished\r\n     the tender revelations of the hopes and fears, the struggles and\r\n     triumphs through which each soul had passed, these sacred\r\n     memories seemed to bind us anew together in a friendship that we\r\n     hope may never end. A sumptuous lunch followed, and amid much\r\n     gaiety and laughter the guests dispersed, giving the hospitable\r\n     host and hostess a warm farewell--a day to be remembered by all\r\n     of us.\r\n\r\nOur Senate committee, through its chairman, Hon. Elbridge G.\r\nLapham, very soon reported in favor of the submission of a\r\nsixteenth amendment. We had had a favorable minority report in the\r\nHouse in 1871 and in the Senate in 1879--but this was the first\r\nfavorable majority report we had ever had in either house:\r\n\r\n                                   IN THE SENATE, MONDAY, June 5, 1882.\r\n\r\n     Mr. LAPHAM: I am instructed by the Select Committee on Woman\r\n     Suffrage, to whom was referred the joint resolution (S. R. No.\r\n     60) proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\n     States, to report it with a favorable recommendation, without\r\n     amendment, for the consideration of the Senate. This is a\r\n     majority report, and the minority desire the opportunity to\r\n     present their report also, and have printed the reasons which\r\n     they give for dissenting. As this is a question of more than\r\n     ordinary importance, I should like to have 1,000 extra copies of\r\n     the report printed for the use of the committee.\r\n\r\n     Mr. GEORGE: I present the views of the minority of the committee,\r\n     consisting of the senator from Tennessee [Mr. Jackson], the\r\n     senator from Nevada [Mr. Fair], and myself.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT _pro tempore_: It is moved that 1,000 extra copies\r\n     of the report be printed for the use of the Senate.\r\n\r\n     Mr. ANTHONY: The motion should go by the statute to the Committee\r\n     on Printing.\r\n\r\n     Mr. LAPHAM: I will present it in the form of a resolution for\r\n     reference to the Committee on Printing.\r\n\r\n     The resolution was referred to the Committee on Printing, as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That 1,000 additional copies of the report and\r\n          views of the minority on Senate Joint Resolution No. 60 be\r\n          printed for the use of the Select Committee on Woman\r\n          Suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate of the United States, June 5, 1882, Mr. Lapham, from\r\nthe Committee on Woman Suffrage, submitted the following report:\r\n\r\n     _The Select Committee on Woman Suffrage, to whom was referred\r\n     Senate Resolution No. 60, proposing an amendment to the\r\n     Constitution of the United States to secure the right of suffrage\r\n     to all citizens without regard to sex, having considered the\r\n     same, respectfully report: _\r\n\r\n     The gravity and importance of the proposed amendment must be\r\n     obvious to all who have given the subject the consideration it\r\n     demands.\r\n\r\n     A very brief history of the origin of this movement in the United\r\n     States and of the progress made in the cause of female suffrage\r\n     will not be out of place at this time. A World's Anti-slavery\r\n     Convention was held in London on June 12, 1840, to which\r\n     delegates from all the organized societies were invited. Several\r\n     of the American societies sent women as delegates. Their\r\n     credentials were presented, and an able and exhaustive discussion\r\n     was had by many of the leading men of America and Great Britain\r\n     upon the question of their being admitted to seats in the\r\n     convention. They were allowed no part in the discussion. They\r\n     were denied seats as delegates, and, by reason of that denial, it\r\n     was determined to hold conventions after their return to the\r\n     United States, for the purpose of asserting and advocating their\r\n     rights as citizens, and especially the right of suffrage. Prior\r\n     to this, and as early as the year 1836, a proposal had been made\r\n     in the legislature of the State of New York to confer upon\r\n     married women their separate rights of property. The subject was\r\n     under consideration and agitation during the eventful period\r\n     which preceded the constitutional convention of New York in the\r\n     year 1846, and the radical changes made in the fundamental law in\r\n     that year. In 1848 the first act \"For the More Effectual\r\n     Protection of the Property of Married Women\" was passed by the\r\n     legislature of New York and became a law. It passed by a vote of\r\n     93 to 9 in the Assembly and 23 to 1 in the Senate. It was\r\n     subsequently amended so as to authorize women to engage in\r\n     business on their own account and to receive their own earnings.\r\n     This legislation was the outgrowth of a bill prepared several\r\n     years before under the direction of the Hon. John Savage,\r\n     chief-justice of the Supreme Court, and of the Hon. John C.\r\n     Spencer, one of the ablest lawyers in the State, one of the\r\n     revisers of the statutes of New York, and afterward a cabinet\r\n     officer. Laws granting separate rights of property and the right\r\n     to transact business, similar to those adopted in New York, have\r\n     been enacted in many, if not in most of the States, and may now\r\n     be regarded as the settled policy of American legislation on the\r\n     subject.\r\n\r\n     After the enactment of the first law in New York, as before\r\n     stated, and in the month of July, 1848, the first convention\r\n     demanding suffrage for women was held at Seneca Falls in said\r\n     State. The same persons who had been excluded from the World's\r\n     Convention in London were prominent and instrumental in calling\r\n     the meeting and in framing the declaration of sentiments adopted\r\n     by it, which, after reciting the unjust limitations and wrongs to\r\n     which women are subjected, closed in these words:\r\n\r\n          Now, in view of this entire disfranchisement of one-half of\r\n          the people of this country and their social and religious\r\n          degradation; in view of the unjust laws above mentioned, and\r\n          because women do feel themselves aggrieved, oppressed and\r\n          fraudulently deprived of their most sacred rights, we insist\r\n          that they have immediate admission to all the rights and\r\n          privileges which belong to them as citizens of the United\r\n          States. In entering upon the great work before us we\r\n          anticipate no small amount of misconception,\r\n          misrepresentation and ridicule; but we shall use every\r\n          instrumentality within our power to effect our object. We\r\n          shall employ agents, circulate tracts, petition the State\r\n          and national legislatures, and endeavor to enlist the pulpit\r\n          and the press in our behalf. We hope this convention will be\r\n          followed by a series of conventions embracing every part of\r\n          the country.\r\n\r\n     The meeting also adopted a series of resolutions, one of which\r\n     was in the following words:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That it is the duty of the women of this country\r\n          to secure to themselves their sacred right to the elective\r\n          franchise.\r\n\r\n     This declaration was signed by seventy of the women of Western\r\n     New York, among whom was one or more of those who addressed your\r\n     committee on the subject of the pending amendment, and there were\r\n     present, participating in and approving of the movement, a large\r\n     number of prominent men, among whom were Elisha Foote, a lawyer\r\n     of distinction, and since that time Commissioner of Patents, and\r\n     the Hon. Jacob Chamberlain, who afterwards represented his\r\n     district in the other House. From the movement thus inaugurated,\r\n     conventions have been held from that time to the present in the\r\n     principal villages, cities and capitals of the various States, as\r\n     well as the capital of the nation.\r\n\r\n     The First National Convention upon the subject was held at\r\n     Worcester, Mass., in October, 1850, and had the support and\r\n     encouragement of many leading men of the republic, among whom we\r\n     name the following: Gerrit Smith, Joshua R.

Elder, Stephen S. Foster, Horace Greeley,\r\n     Oliver Johnson, Henry Ward Beecher, Horace Mann. The Fourth\r\n     National Convention was held at the city of Cleveland, Ohio,\r\n     October, 1853. The Rev. Asa Mahan, president of Oberlin College,\r\n     and Hon. Joshua R. Giddings were there. Horace Greeley and\r\n     William Henry Channing addressed letters to the convention. The\r\n     letter of Mr. Channing stated the proposition to be  that--\r\n\r\n          The right of suffrage be granted to the people, universally,\r\n          without distinction of sex; and that the age for attaining\r\n          legal and political majority be made the same for women as\r\n          for men.\r\n\r\n     In 1857, Hon. Salmon P. Chase, chief-justice of the Supreme Court\r\n     of the United States, then governor of Ohio, recommended to the\r\n     legislature a constitutional amendment on the subject, and a\r\n     select committee of the Senate made an elaborate report,\r\n     concluding with a resolution in the following words:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the Judiciary Committee be instructed to\r\n          report to the Senate a bill to submit to the qualified\r\n          electors, at the next general election for senators and\r\n          representatives, an amendment to the constitution, whereby\r\n          the elective franchise shall be extended to the citizens of\r\n          Ohio _without distinction of sex_.\r\n\r\n     During the same year a similar report was made in the legislature\r\n     of Wisconsin. From the report on the subject we quote the\r\n     following:\r\n\r\n          We believe that political equality, by leading the thoughts\r\n          and purposes of men and women into the same channel, will\r\n          more completely carry out the designs of nature. Woman will\r\n          be possessed of a positive power, and hollow compliments\r\n          will be exchanged for well-grounded respect when we see her\r\n          nobly discharging her part in the great intellectual and\r\n          moral struggles of the age that wait their solution by a\r\n          direct appeal to the ballot-box. Woman's power is at present\r\n          poetical and unsubstantial; let it be practical and real.\r\n          There is no reality in any power that cannot be coined in\r\n          votes.\r\n\r\n     The effect of these discussions and efforts has been the gradual\r\n     advancement of public sentiment towards conceding the right of\r\n     suffrage without distinction of sex. In the territories of\r\n     Wyoming and Utah, full suffrage has already been given. In regard\r\n     to the exercise of the right in the territory of Wyoming, the\r\n     present governor of that territory, Hon. John W. Hoyt, in an\r\n     address delivered in Philadelphia, April 3, 1882, in answer to a\r\n     question as to the operation of the law, said:\r\n\r\n          First of all, the experience of Wyoming has shown that the\r\n          only actual trial of woman suffrage hitherto made--a trial\r\n          made in a new country where the conditions were not\r\n          exceptionably favorable--has produced none but the most\r\n          desirable results. And surely none will deny that in such a\r\n          matter a single ounce of experience is worth a ton of\r\n          conjecture. But since it may be claimed that the sole\r\n          experiment of Wyoming does not afford a sufficient guaranty\r\n          of general expediency, let us see whether reason will not\r\n          furnish a like answer. The great majority of women in this\r\n          country already possess sufficient intelligence to enable\r\n          them to vote judiciously on nearly all questions of a local\r\n          nature. I think this will be conceded. Secondly, with their\r\n          superior quickness of perception, it is fair to assume that\r\n          when stimulated by a demand for a knowledge of political\r\n          principles--such a demand as a sense of the responsibility\r\n          of the voter would create--they would not be slow in rising\r\n          to at least the rather low level at present occupied by the\r\n          average masculine voter. So that, viewing the subject from\r\n          an intellectual stand-point merely, such fears as at first\r\n          spring up, drop away, one by one, and disappear. But it must\r\n          not be forgotten that a very large proportion of questions\r\n          to be settled by the ballot, both those of principle and\r\n          such as refer to candidates, have in them a _moral_ element\r\n          which is vital. And here we are safer with the ballot in the\r\n          hands of woman; for her keener insight and truer moral sense\r\n          will more certainly guide her aright--and not her alone, but\r\n          also, by reflex action, all whose minds are open to the\r\n          influence of her example. The weight of this answer can\r\n          hardly be overestimated. In my judgment, this moral\r\n          consideration far more than offsets all the objections that\r\n          can be based on any assumed lack of an intellectual\r\n          appreciation of the few questions almost wholly commercial\r\n          and economical. Last of all, a majority of questions to be\r\n          voted on touch the interests of woman as they do those of\r\n          man. It is upon her finer sensibilities, her purer\r\n          instincts, and her maternal nature that the results of\r\n          immorality and vice in every form fall with more crushing\r\n          weight.\r\n\r\n     A criticism has been made upon the exercise of this right by the\r\n     women of Utah that the plural wives in that territory are under\r\n     the control of their polygamous husbands. Be that as it may, it\r\n     is an undoubted fact that there is probably no city of equal size\r\n     on this continent where there is less disturbance of the peace,\r\n     or where the citizen is more secure in his person or property,\r\n     either by day or night, than in the city of Salt Lake. A\r\n     qualified right of suffrage has also been given to women in\r\n     Oregon, Colorado, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Vermont, New\r\n     Hampshire, Massachusetts, Michigan, Kentucky, and New York. Of\r\n     the operation of the law in the last-named State, Governor\r\n     Cornell in a message to the legislature on May 12, said:\r\n\r\n          The recent law, 1882, making women eligible as school\r\n          trustees, has produced admirable results, not only in\r\n          securing the election of many of them as trustees of\r\n          schools, but especially in elevating the qualifications of\r\n          men proposed as candidates for school-boards, and also in\r\n          stimulating greater interest in the management of schools\r\n          generally. The effect of these new experiences is to widen\r\n          the influence and usefulness of women.\r\n\r\n     So well satisfied are the representatives in the legislature of\r\n     that State with these results that the assembly, by a large\r\n     majority, recently passed to a third reading an act giving the\r\n     full right of suffrage to women, the passage of which has been\r\n     arrested in the Senate by an opinion of the attorney-general that\r\n     a constitutional amendment is necessary to accomplish the object.\r\n     In England women are allowed to vote at all municipal elections,\r\n     and hold the office of guardian of the poor. In four States,\r\n     Nebraska, Indiana, Oregon, and Iowa, propositions have passed\r\n     their legislatures and are now pending, conferring the right of\r\n     suffrage upon women.\r\n\r\n     Notwithstanding all these efforts, it is the opinion of the best\r\n     informed men and women, who have devoted more than a third of a\r\n     century to the consideration and discussion of the subject, that\r\n     an amendment to the federal constitution, analogous to the\r\n     fifteenth amendment of that instrument, is the most safe, direct,\r\n     and expeditious mode of settling the question. It is the question\r\n     of the enfranchisement of half the race now denied the right, and\r\n     that, too, the most favored half in the estimation of those who\r\n     deny the right. Petitions, from time to time, signed by many\r\n     thousands, have been presented to congress, and there are now\r\n     upon our files seventy-five petitions representing eighteen\r\n     different States. Two years ago treble the number of petitions,\r\n     representing over twenty-five States, were presented.\r\n\r\n     If congress should adopt the pending resolution, the question\r\n     would go before the intelligent bodies who are chosen to\r\n     represent the people in the legislatures of the various States,\r\n     and would receive a more enlightened and careful consideration\r\n     than if submitted to the masses of the male population, with all\r\n     their prejudices, in the form of an amendment to the\r\n     constitutions of the several States. Besides, such an amendment,\r\n     if adopted, would secure that uniformity in the exercise of the\r\n     right which could not be expected by action from the several\r\n     States. We think the time has arrived for the submission of such\r\n     an amendment to the legislatures of the States. We know the\r\n     prejudices which the movement for suffrage to all without regard\r\n     to sex, had to encounter from the very outset, prejudices which\r\n     still exist in the minds of many. The period for employing the\r\n     weapons of ridicule and enmity has not yet passed. Now, as in the\r\n     beginning, we hear appeals to prejudice and the baser passions of\r\n     men. The anathema, \"woe betide the hand that plucks the wizard\r\n     beard of hoary error,\" is yet employed to deter men from acting\r\n     upon their convictions as to what ought to be done with reference\r\n     to this great question. To those who are inclined to cast\r\n     ridicule upon the movement, we quote the answer made while one of\r\n     the early conventions was in session in the State of New York:\r\n\r\n          A collection of women arguing for political rights and for\r\n          the privileges usually conceded only to the other sex is one\r\n          of the easiest things in the world to make fun of. There is\r\n          no end to the smart speeches and the witty remarks that may\r\n          be made on the subject. But when we seriously attempt to\r\n          show that a woman who pays taxes ought not to have a voice\r\n          in the manner in which the taxes are expended, that a woman\r\n          whose property and liberty and person are controlled by the\r\n          laws should have no voice in framing those laws, it is not\r\n          so easy. If women are fit to rule in a monarchy, it is\r\n          difficult to say why they are not qualified to vote in a\r\n          republic; nor can there be greater indelicacy in a woman\r\n          going to the ballot-box than there is in a woman opening a\r\n          legislature or issuing orders to an army.\r\n\r\n     To all who are more serious in their opposition to the movement,\r\n     we would remind them of the words of a few distinguished  men:--\r\n\r\n          I go for all sharing the privileges of the government who\r\n          assist in bearing its burdens, by no means excluding\r\n          women.--[ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n          I believe that the vices in our large cities will never be\r\n          conquered until the ballot is put into the hands of\r\n          women.--[Bishop SIMPSON.\r\n\r\n          I do not think our politics will be what it ought to be till\r\n          women are legislators and voters.--[Rev. JAMES FREEMAN\r\n          CLARKE.\r\n\r\n          Women have quite as much interest in good government as men,\r\n          and I have never heard or read of any satisfactory reason\r\n          for excluding them from the ballot-box; I have no more doubt\r\n          of their ameliorating influence upon politics than I have of\r\n          the influence they exert everywhere else.--[GEORGE WILLIAM\r\n          CURTIS.\r\n\r\n          In view of the terrible corruption of our politics, people\r\n          ask, can we maintain universal suffrage? I say no, not\r\n          without women. The only bear-gardens in our community are\r\n          the town-meeting and the caucus. Why is this? Because these\r\n          are the only places at which women are not present.--[Bishop\r\n          GILBERT HAVEN.\r\n\r\n          I repeat my conviction of the right of woman suffrage.\r\n          Because suffrage is a right and not a grace, it should be\r\n          extended to women who bear their share of the public cost,\r\n          and who have the same interest that I have in the selection\r\n          of officials and the making of laws which affect their\r\n          lives, their property, and their happiness.--[Governor LONG\r\n          of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n          However much the giving of political power to woman may\r\n          disagree with our notions of propriety, we conclude that,\r\n          being required by that first prerequisite to greater\r\n          happiness, the law of equal freedom, such a concession is\r\n          unquestionably right and good.--[HERBERT SPENCER.\r\n\r\n          In the administration of a State neither a woman as a woman,\r\n          nor a man as a man has any special functions, but the gifts\r\n          are equally diffused in both sexes. The same opportunity for\r\n          self-development which makes man a good guardian will make\r\n          woman a good guardian, for their original nature is the\r\n          same.--[PLATO.\r\n\r\n     It has become a custom, almost universal, to invite and to\r\n     welcome the presence of women at political assemblages, to listen\r\n     to discussions upon the topics involved in the canvass. Their\r\n     presence has done much toward the elevation, refinement, and\r\n     freedom from insincerity and hypocrisy, of such discussions. Why\r\n     would not the same results be wrought out by their presence at\r\n     the ballot-box? Wherever the right has been exercised by law,\r\n     both in England and this country, such has been its effect in the\r\n     conduct of elections.\r\n\r\n     The framers of our system of government embodied in the\r\n     Declaration of Independence the statement that to secure the\r\n     rights which are therein declared to be inalienable and in\r\n     respect to which all men are created equal, \"governments are\r\n     instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent\r\n     of the governed.\" The system of representative government they\r\n     inaugurated can only be maintained and perpetuated by allowing\r\n     all citizens to give that consent through the medium of the\r\n     ballot-box--the only mode in which the \"consent of the governed\"\r\n     can be obtained. To deny to one-half of the citizens of the\r\n     republic all participation in framing the laws by which they are\r\n     to be governed, simply on account of their sex, is political\r\n     despotism to those who are excluded, and \"taxation without\r\n     representation\" to such of them as have property liable to\r\n     taxation. Their investiture with separate estates leads,\r\n     logically and necessarily, to their right to the ballot as the\r\n     only means afforded them for the protection of their property, as\r\n     it is the only means of their full protection in the enjoyment of\r\n     the immeasurably greater right to life and liberty. To be\r\n     governed without such consent is clear denial of a right declared\r\n     to be inalienable.\r\n\r\n     It is said that the majority of women do not desire and would not\r\n     exercise the right, if acknowledged. The assertion rests in\r\n     conjecture. In ordinary elections multitudes of men do not\r\n     exercise the right. It is only in extraordinary cases, and when\r\n     their interests and patriotism are appealed to, that male voters\r\n     are with unanimity found at the polls. It would doubtless be the\r\n     same with women. In the exceptional instances in which the\r\n     exercise of the right has been permitted, they have engaged with\r\n     zeal in every important canvass. Even if the statement were\r\n     founded in fact, it furnishes no argument in favor of excluding\r\n     women from the exercise of the franchise. _It is the denial of\r\n     the right of which they complain._ There are multitudes of men\r\n     whose vote can be purchased at an election for the smallest and\r\n     most trifling consideration. Yet all such would spurn with scorn\r\n     and unutterable contempt a proposition to purchase their _right\r\n     to vote_, and no consideration would be deemed an equivalent for\r\n     such a surrender. Women are more sensitive upon this question\r\n     than men, and so long as this right, deemed by them to be sacred,\r\n     is denied, so long the agitation which has marked the progress of\r\n     this contest thus far will be continued.\r\n\r\n     Entertaining these views, your committee report back the proposed\r\n     resolution without amendment for the consideration of the Senate,\r\n     and recommend its passage.\r\n\r\n                                             E.

BLAIR.\r\n\r\n     The constitution is wisely conservative in the provision for its\r\n     own amendment. It is eminently proper that whenever a large\r\n     number of the people have indicated a desire for an amendment,\r\n     the judgment of the amending power should be consulted. In view\r\n     of the extensive agitation of the question of woman suffrage, and\r\n     the numerous and respectable petitions that have been presented\r\n     to congress in its support, I unite with the committee in\r\n     recommending that the proposed amendment be submitted to the\r\n     States.\r\n\r\n                                             H. B. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\nJune 5, 1882, Mr. George, from the Committee on Woman Suffrage,\r\nsubmitted the following views of the minority:\r\n\r\n     The undersigned are unable to concur in the report of the\r\n     majority recommending the adoption of the joint resolution\r\n     proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States,\r\n     for reasons which they will now proceed to state.\r\n\r\n     We do not base our dissent upon any ground having relation to the\r\n     expediency or inexpediency of vesting in women the right to vote.\r\n     Hence we shall not discuss the very grave and important social\r\n     and political questions which have arisen from the agitation to\r\n     admit to equal political rights the women of our country, and to\r\n     impose on them the burden of discharging, equally with men,\r\n     political and public duties. Whether so radical a change in our\r\n     political and social system would advance the happiness and\r\n     welfare of the American people, considered as a whole, without\r\n     distinction of sex, is a question on which there is a marked\r\n     disagreement among the most enlightened and thoughtful of both\r\n     sexes. Its solution involves considerations so intimately\r\n     pertaining to all the relations of social and private life--the\r\n     family circle--the status of women as wives, mothers, daughters,\r\n     and companions, to the functions in private and public life which\r\n     they ought to perform, and their ability and willingness to\r\n     perform them--the harmony and stability of marriage, and the\r\n     division of the labors and cares of that union--that we are\r\n     convinced that the proper and safe discussion and weighing of\r\n     them would be best secured by deliberations in the separate\r\n     communities which have so deep an interest in the rightful\r\n     solution of this grave question. Great organic changes in\r\n     government, especially when they involve, as this proposed change\r\n     does, a revolution in the modes of life, long-standing habits,\r\n     and the most sacred domestic relations of the people, should\r\n     result only upon the demand of the people, who are to be affected\r\n     by them. Such changes should originate with, and be molded and\r\n     guided in their operation and extent by, the people themselves.\r\n     They should neither precede their demand for them, nor be delayed\r\n     in opposition to their clearly expressed wishes. Their happiness,\r\n     their welfare, their advancement, are the sole objects of the\r\n     institution of government; of these they are not only the best,\r\n     but they are the exclusive judges. They have commissioned us to\r\n     exercise for their good the great powers which they have\r\n     intrusted to us by their letter of attorney, the constitution;\r\n     not to assume to ourselves a superior wisdom, or usurp a\r\n     guardianship over them, dictating reforms not demanded by them,\r\n     and attempting to grasp power not granted.\r\n\r\n     The organization of our political institutions is such that the\r\n     great mass of the powers of government, the proper exercise of\r\n     which so deeply concerns the welfare of the people, is left to\r\n     the States. In that depository the will of the people is most\r\n     certainly ascertained, and the exercise of power is more directly\r\n     under their guidance. Our free institutions have had their great\r\n     development and owe their stability more to causes connected with\r\n     the direct exercise of the power of the people in local\r\n     self-government than to all other causes combined. Recent events,\r\n     though tending strongly to centralization, have not destroyed in\r\n     the public mind the inestimable value of local self-government.\r\n     Among the powers which have hitherto been esteemed as most\r\n     essential to the public welfare is the power of the States to\r\n     regulate their domestic institutions in their own way; and among\r\n     those institutions none has been preserved by the States with\r\n     greater jealousy than their absolute control over marriage and\r\n     the relation between the sexes.\r\n\r\n     Another power of the States, deemed by the people when they\r\n     assented to the Constitution of the United States most essential\r\n     to the public welfare, was the right of each State to determine\r\n     the qualifications of electors. Wherever the federal constitution\r\n     speaks of elections for a federal office, it adopts the\r\n     qualifications for electors prescribed by the State in which the\r\n     election is to be held.\r\n\r\n     Nor has this fundamental rule been departed from in the fifteenth\r\n     amendment. That impairs it only to the extent that race, color,\r\n     or previous condition of servitude shall not be made a ground of\r\n     exclusion from the right of suffrage. In all else that pertains\r\n     to the qualifications of electors the absolute will of the State\r\n     prevails. This amendment was inserted from considerations which\r\n     pertain to no other part of the question of suffrage. The negro\r\n     race had been recently emancipated; it was supposed that the\r\n     antagonism between them and their old masters and the prejudice\r\n     of race would be such as to obstruct the equal enjoyment of the\r\n     rights of freedom conferred by the national forces, and would\r\n     prevent the white race of the South from admitting the negro\r\n     race, however deserving it might be, to equal political\r\n     privileges. And, moreover, it was deemed by the North a point of\r\n     honor that, having conferred freedom on the negro, he should be\r\n     provided with the right of suffrage.\r\n\r\n     None of these considerations applies in the present case. It is\r\n     not pretended that any such antagonism or prejudice exists\r\n     between the sexes. It is not pretended that women have been\r\n     redeemed from an intolerable slavery by the power of the\r\n     government. It is not pretended that the sex in whose hands is\r\n     the political power of the States is unwilling, from any cause,\r\n     to do full justice to the other; for it is conceded that if the\r\n     proposed amendment should be adopted, its incorporation into the\r\n     constitution must result from the voluntary action of that sex in\r\n     which is vested this political power. No good reason has been\r\n     given why the congress of the United States should force or even\r\n     hasten the States into such action, and no such reason can be\r\n     given without a reversal of the theories on which our free\r\n     institutions are based.\r\n\r\n     The history given by the majority, of the legislation of the\r\n     several States in relation to the rights of persons and property\r\n     of married women showing as it does a steady advance in the\r\n     abolition of their common-law disabilities, conclusively\r\n     demonstrates that this question may be safely left for solution\r\n     where it now is and has always hitherto belonged. The public mind\r\n     is now being agitated in many of the States as to the rights of\r\n     women, not only as to suffrage, but as to their engaging in the\r\n     various employments from which they have hitherto been excluded.\r\n     This exclusion from certain employments has not been the result\r\n     of municipal but of social laws--the strongest of all human\r\n     regulations. As these social laws have been modified, so the\r\n     sphere of woman's activities and usefulness has been enlarged.\r\n     These social laws are in the main the groundwork of the exclusion\r\n     of women from the right of suffrage. In the establishment of\r\n     these laws, as in their modification, women themselves have even\r\n     a greater influence than men. Their disability to vote is,\r\n     therefore, self-imposed; when they shall will otherwise, it is\r\n     not too much to say that the disability will no longer exist. If\r\n     in the future it shall be found that these laws deny a right to\r\n     women the enjoyment of which they desire, and for the exercise of\r\n     which they are qualified, it cannot be doubted that they will\r\n     give way. If, on the contrary, neither of these shall be\r\n     discovered, it will happen that the exclusion of suffrage will\r\n     not be considered as a denial of a right, but as an exemption\r\n     granted to women from cares and burdens which a tender and\r\n     affectionate regard for womanhood refuses to cast on them.\r\n\r\n     We are convinced, therefore, that the best mode of disposing of\r\n     the question is to leave its solution to that power most amenable\r\n     to the influences and usages of society in which women have so\r\n     large and so potential a share, confident that at no distant day\r\n     a right result will be reached in each State which will be\r\n     satisfactory to both sexes and perfectly consistent with the\r\n     welfare and happiness of the people. Certainly this must be so if\r\n     the people themselves, the source and foundation of all power,\r\n     are capable of self-government.\r\n\r\n     At two of its meetings the committee listened with great pleasure\r\n     to several eminent ladies who appeared before it as advocates of\r\n     the proposed amendment. At none of the meetings of the committee,\r\n     including that at which the members voted on the proposed\r\n     amendment, was there any discussion of this important subject;\r\n     none was asked for or desired by any member of the committee, and\r\n     the vote was taken. The reports of the majority and of the\r\n     minority of the committee are therefore to be construed only as\r\n     the individual opinions of the members who respectively concur in\r\n     them. They are in no sense to be treated as the judgment of a\r\n     deliberative body charged with the examination of this important\r\n     subject.\r\n\r\n     The foregoing leads us to but one recommendation: that the\r\n     committee should be discharged from the further consideration of\r\n     the subject, that the resolution raising it be rescinded, and\r\n     that the proposed amendment be rejected.\r\n\r\n                                             J. Z. GEORGE,\r\n                                             HOWELL E. JACKSON,\r\n                                             JAMES G. FAIR.\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Miss Caroline Biggs to the president of the\r\nNational Association the following congratulations came from the\r\nfriends of suffrage in England:\r\n\r\n\r\n                  CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR      }\r\n                       WOMAN SUFFRAGE, 64 Berners Street, LONDON, W. }\r\n\r\n     At a meeting of the Executive Committee, on May 18, 1882, the\r\n     following resolution was proposed by Mrs. Lucas, seconded by Miss\r\n     Jane Cobden, and passed unanimously:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the Executive Committee of the National\r\n          Society for Woman Suffrage have heard with hearty\r\n          satisfaction that a select committee of the United States\r\n          Senate in Washington has passed by a majority of votes the\r\n          recommendation to adopt a constitutional amendment in favor\r\n          of women's suffrage. They feel that the cause of woman is\r\n          one in all countries, and they offer their most cordial\r\n          congratulations to the women of America on the important\r\n          step which has just been gained, and their warmest\r\n          good-wishes for a speedy success in obtaining a measure\r\n          which will guarantee justice and equal rights to half the\r\n          population of a sister country.\r\n\r\nNebraska now became the center of interest, as a constitutional\r\namendment to secure the right of suffrage to woman was submitted to\r\nbe voted upon in the November election. As the submission of such a\r\nproposition makes an important crisis in the history of a State, as\r\nwell as in the suffrage movement, the notes of preparation were as\r\nvaried as multitudinous throughout the nation, rousing all to\r\nrenewed earnestness in the work. Both the American and National\r\nassociations decided to hold their annual conventions in Omaha, the\r\nchief city of the State, and to support as many speakers[90] as\r\npossible through the campaign, that meetings might be held and\r\ntracts distributed in every county of the State, an Herculean\r\nundertaking, as Nebraska comprises 230,000 inhabitants scattered\r\nover an area of 76,000 square miles, divided into sixty-six\r\ncounties; and yet this is what the friends of the measure proposed\r\nto do. The American Association[91] held its convention September\r\n12, 13, 14. The National[92] continued three days, September 27,\r\n28, 29.\r\n\r\nThe Opera House, in which the National Association held its\r\nmeeting, was completely filled during all the sessions. The address\r\nof welcome was given by Hon. A. J. Poppleton, one of the most\r\ndistinguished lawyers in that State. He said:\r\n\r\n     I deem it no light compliment that, in the face of an explicit\r\n     declaration that I am not in favor of woman suffrage, I have been\r\n     asked to make, on behalf of the people of Omaha and the State, an\r\n     address of welcome to the many distinguished men and women whom\r\n     this occasion has brought together. Doubtless the consideration\r\n     shown me is a recognition of the fact that I have been a\r\n     life-long advocate of the advancement of women through the\r\n     agencies of equality in education, equality in employment,\r\n     equality in wages, equality in property-rights and personal\r\n     liberty, in short, a fair, open, equal field in the struggle for\r\n     life. That I cannot go beyond this and embrace equal suffrage, is\r\n     due rather to long adherence to the political philosophy of\r\n     Edmund Burke than any lack of conviction of the absolute equality\r\n     of men and women in natural rights.\r\n\r\n     In the winter of 1852-3, when a student at Poughkeepsie, N. Y.,\r\n     while the spot on which we now stand was Indian country as yet\r\n     untouched by the formative power of national legislation, I\r\n     listened to Miss Susan B. Anthony, Miss Antoinette Brown and\r\n     others in the advocacy of the rights of women. It seems a strange\r\n     fortune that brings now, nearly thirty years after, one of those\r\n     speakers, crowned with a national reputation, into a State carved\r\n     out of that Indian country and containing 60,000 people, in\r\n     advocacy of equal suffrage for her sex. This single fact\r\n     proclaims in thunder tones the bravery, the fidelity, the\r\n     devotion of these pioneers of reform, and challenges for them the\r\n     sympathy, respect, esteem and admiration of every good man and\r\n     woman in America.\r\n\r\n     The thirty years commencing about 1850 have been prolific of\r\n     momentous changes. It is the era of the sewing machine, of the\r\n     domestication of steam and electricity, the overthrow of the\r\n     great rebellion, the destruction of slavery, the consolidation of\r\n     the German empire, the fall of the second Napoleon, the birth of\r\n     the French republic, the incorporation of India into the British\r\n     empire, and the revolution of commerce by the Pacific railways\r\n     and the Suez canal. Great changes have likewise taken place in\r\n     the structure of our own State and national legislation, the most\r\n     conspicuous and pronounced result being the centralization of\r\n     power in the federal government. It has been preeminently a\r\n     period of amelioration, a long stride in the direction of\r\n     tolerance of opinion, belief, speech and creed. Hospitals,\r\n     asylums, schools, colleges and the manifold agencies of an\r\n     advanced Christian civilization for alleviating the average lot\r\n     of humanity, have grown and multiplied beyond the experience of\r\n     former times, and men like Matthew Vassar, George Peabody and\r\n     John Hopkins have hastened to consecrate the abundant fruits of\r\n     honorable lives to the exaltation and advancement of the race.\r\n\r\n     But in no direction have greater changes occurred in this country\r\n     than in the condition of woman in respect to employment, wages,\r\n     personal and property rights. In all heathen countries at this\r\n     hour the mass of women are slaves or worse, wholly deprived of\r\n     civil rights. In most Christian countries their legal status is\r\n     one of absolute subordination in person and property to men. In\r\n     this republic alone have we attained an altitude where some small\r\n     measure of justice is meted out to women by the laws. In 1850 a\r\n     fair measure of her rights was the grim edict of the common law\r\n     holding her in guardianship prior to marriage, and upon marriage\r\n     making her and all her possessions practically the property of\r\n     her husband, while a cruel, unreasonable and vicious public\r\n     opinion excluded her from all except menial and ill-paid service.\r\n     One by one and year by year these barriers have given way, until\r\n     in many States her property and personal rights enjoy the\r\n     complete shelter of the law. Now more than half the occupations\r\n     and employments of this age of industrial activity and progress\r\n     are thronged with the faithful, efficient and contented labor of\r\n     women.\r\n\r\n     The law has broken forever the thraldom of an odious and hopeless\r\n     marriage by reasonable laws for divorce for just cause, given her\r\n     the custody of her children, vested her with the absolute power\r\n     of disposition and control over her property, inherited or\r\n     acquired, freed it from the claims of her husband's creditors,\r\n     and clothed her with ample legal remedies even against her\r\n     husband. Perhaps Nebraska alone of all the States, by its court\r\n     of last resort, has upheld the power of the wife to make\r\n     contracts with her husband and enforce them against him in her\r\n     own name by the appropriate legal remedies. This surely is\r\n     progress. Beyond this there lies but one field to win or fortress\r\n     to reduce. Then surely the worn soldier in the long campaign\r\n     crowned with the garlands of victory may rest from the battle.\r\n\r\n     Not many years ago, coming from Wisconsin, I think, a girl\r\n     presented herself in the Illinois courts for admission to the\r\n     bar, and after a rigid and unsparing examination she was admitted\r\n     with public compliment. She took an office in the great city of\r\n     Chicago and in the short remnant of an uncertain life so wrought\r\n     in her profession as to attain an average professional income,\r\n     and win the undivided respect and esteem of her professional\r\n     associates. And when from a far country, whither she had gone in\r\n     hope to escape a fell disease, her lifeless corpse was brought\r\n     back for sepulture, many of the foremost lawyers of Chicago\r\n     gathered about her bier and bore emphatic testimony to her\r\n     virtues as a woman and her attainments as a lawyer. To me no\r\n     greater work has been done by any American woman. When Alta\r\n     Hulett unobtrusively, silently but indomitably pressed her way to\r\n     the front of the legal profession, and established herself there,\r\n     she vindicated the right of her sex to contend for the highest\r\n     prizes of life, and left her countrywomen a legacy which will\r\n     ultimately blazon her name imperishably in the history of the\r\n     advancement of women; and every American woman who, like her,\r\n     goes to the front of any honorable occupation, employment or\r\n     profession, and stays there, becomes her coaedjutor in work and a\r\n     sharer in her reward.\r\n\r\n     Laden with the trophies of thirty years of conflict, of progress,\r\n     of measurable success, the vice-president of the National Woman\r\n     Suffrage Association and her associates present themselves to\r\n     Nebraska and ask a hearing upon the final issue, \"Shall this work\r\n     be crowned by granting to women in this State the highest\r\n     privilege of the citizen--suffrage?\" On behalf of the people of a\r\n     State whose legislature has granted everything else to\r\n     women--whose devotion to free speech, untrammeled discussion and\r\n     an independent press has been conspicuous in its constitutional\r\n     and legislative history--I welcome them to this city and State,\r\n     and bespeak for them a patient, candid, respectful, appreciative\r\n     hearing.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony replied briefly to Mr. Poppleton's eloquent address\r\nand returned the thanks of the convention for the courtesy with\r\nwhich its members had been received by the citizens of Omaha.[93]\r\nShe then read a letter from the president of the convention:\r\n\r\n                                  TOULOUSE, France, September 1, 1882.\r\n\r\n     _To the National Woman Suffrage Association in Convention\r\n     assembled:_\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIENDS: People never appreciate the magnitude and\r\n     importance on any step in progress, at the time it is taken, nor\r\n     the full moral worth of the characters who inspire it, hence it\r\n     will be in line with the whole history of reform from the\r\n     beginning if woman's enfranchisement in Nebraska should in many\r\n     minds seem puerile and premature, and its advocates fanatical and\r\n     unreasonable. Nevertheless the proposition speaks for itself. A\r\n     constitutional amendment to crown one-half of the people of a\r\n     great State with all their civil and political rights, is the\r\n     most vital question the citizens of Nebraska have ever been\r\n     called on to consider; and the fact cannot be gainsaid that some\r\n     of the purest and ablest women America can boast, are now in the\r\n     State advocating the measure.\r\n\r\n     For the last two months I have been assisting my son in the\r\n     compilation of a work soon to be published in America, under the\r\n     title, \"The Woman Question in Europe,\" to which distinguished\r\n     women in different nations have each contributed a sketch of the\r\n     progress made in their condition. One interesting and significant\r\n     fact as shown in this work, is, that in the very years we began\r\n     to agitate the question of equal rights, there was a simultaneous\r\n     movement by women for various privileges, industrial, social,\r\n     educational, civil and political, throughout the civilized world.\r\n     And this without the slightest concert of action, or knowledge of\r\n     each other's existence, showing that the time had come in the\r\n     natural evolution of the species, in the order of human\r\n     development, for woman to assert her rights, and to demand the\r\n     recognition of the feminine element in all the vital interests of\r\n     life.\r\n\r\n     To battle against a palpable fact in philosophy and the\r\n     accumulated facts in achievement that can be seen on all sides in\r\n     woman's work for the last forty years, from slavery to equality,\r\n     is as vain as to fight against the law of gravitation. We shall\r\n     as surely reach the goal we purposed when we started, as that the\r\n     rich prairies of Nebraska will ere long feed and educate millions\r\n     of brave men and women, gathered from every nation on the globe.\r\n     Every consideration for the improvement of your home life, for\r\n     the morality of your towns and cities, for the elevation of your\r\n     schools and colleges, and the loftiest motives of patriotism\r\n     should move you, men of Nebraska, to vote for this amendment.\r\n     Galton in his great work on Heredity says:\r\n\r\n          We are in crying want of a greater fund of ability in all\r\n          stations of life, for neither the classes of statesmen,\r\n          philosophers, artisans nor laborers, are up to the modern\r\n          complexity of their several professions. An extended\r\n          civilization like ours comprises more interests than the\r\n          ordinary statesmen or philosophers of our race are capable\r\n          of dealing with, and it exacts more intelligent work than\r\n          our ordinary artisans and laborers, are capable of\r\n          performing. Our race is overweighted, and appears likely to\r\n          be dragged into degeneracy by demands that exceed its\r\n          powers. If its average ability were raised a grade or two, a\r\n          new class of statesmen would conduct our complex affairs at\r\n          home and abroad, as easily as our best business men now do\r\n          their own private trades and professions. The needs of\r\n          centralization, communication, and culture, call for more\r\n          brains and mental stamina, than the average of our race\r\n          possesses.\r\n\r\n     Does it need a prophet to tell us where to begin this work? Does\r\n     not the physical and intellectual condition of the women of a\r\n     nation decide the capacity and power of its men? If we would give\r\n     our sons the help and inspiration of woman's thought and interest\r\n     in the complex questions of our present civilization, we must\r\n     first give her the power that political responsibility secures.\r\n     With the ballot in her own right hand, she would feel a new sense\r\n     of dignity, and command among men a respect they have never felt\r\n     before.\r\n\r\n     Nebraska has now the opportunity of making this grand experiment\r\n     of securing justice, liberty, equality, for the first time in the\r\n     world's history, to woman, through her education and\r\n     enfranchisement, of lifting man to that higher plane of thought\r\n     where he may be able wisely to meet all the emergencies of the\r\n     period in which he is called on to act. Let every man in Nebraska\r\n     now so do his duty, that, when the sun goes down on the eighth of\r\n     November, the glad news may be sent round the world that at last\r\n     one State in the American republic has fully accorded the sacred\r\n     right of self-government to all her citizens, black and white,\r\n     men and women. With sincere hope for this victory,\r\n\r\n                         Cordially yours,       ELIZABETH CADY STANTON.\r\n\r\nMany interesting letters were received from friends at home and\r\nabroad, of which we give a few. The following is from our Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary at the German Court:\r\n\r\n                                   BERLIN, September 9, 1882.\r\n\r\n     Miss ANTHONY: _Esteemed Friend_: At this great distance I can\r\n     only sympathize with the earnest effort to be made this fall to\r\n     secure political recognition for women in Nebraska. I am glad\r\n     that the prospect is so good and that Nebraska, which gave a\r\n     name, with Kansas, to the first successful resistance to the\r\n     encroachments of slavery, is the arena where the battle is to be\r\n     fought under such promise of a just result. By recognizing the\r\n     right of its women to an equal share in all the duties and\r\n     responsibilities of life, Nebraska will honor itself while\r\n     securing for all time wholesome laws and administration.\r\n\r\n     I believe society would more benefit itself than grant a favor to\r\n     women by extending the suffrage to them. All the interests of\r\n     women are promoted by a government that shall guard the family\r\n     circle, restrain excess, promote education, shield the young from\r\n     temptation. While the true interests of men lie in the same\r\n     direction, women more generally appreciate these facts and\r\n     illustrate in their lives a desire for their attainment. Could we\r\n     bring to the ballot-box the great fund of virtue, intelligence\r\n     and good intention stored up in the minds and hearts of our wives\r\n     and sisters, how great the reinforcement would be for all that is\r\n     noble, patriotic and pure in public life! Who should fear the\r\n     result who desires the public welfare? From the stand-point of\r\n     better principles applied to the direction of public affairs and\r\n     the best individuals in office, the argument seems impregnable.\r\n\r\n     It is getting late to resist this measure on the ground that the\r\n     character of women themselves would be lowered by contact with\r\n     politics. That objection is identical with the motive which\r\n     causes the Turk to shut up his women in a harem and closely veil\r\n     them in public. He fears their delicacy will be tarnished if they\r\n     speak to any man but their proprietor. So prejudice feared woman\r\n     would be unsexed if she had equal education with man. The\r\n     professions were closed to women for the same consideration.\r\n     Women have vindicated their ability to endure the education and\r\n     engage in the dreaded pursuits, yet society is not dissolved, and\r\n     these fearful imaginings have proved idle dreams. As every\r\n     advance made by woman since the days when it was a mooted\r\n     law-point how large could be the stick with which her husband\r\n     could punish her, down to the day when congress opened to her the\r\n     bar of the United States Supreme Court, has been accompanied by\r\n     constantly refuted assertions that she and society were about to\r\n     be ruined. I think we can safely trust to her good sense, virtue\r\n     and delicacy to preserve for us the loved and venerated object we\r\n     have always known, even if society shall yield the still further\r\n     measure of complete enfranchisement, and thus add to her social\r\n     dignity, duties and responsibilities.\r\n\r\n     No class has ever been degraded by the ballot. All have rather\r\n     been elevated by it. We cannot rationally anticipate less\r\n     desirable personal consequences to those whose tendencies are\r\n     naturally good, than to those on whom the ballot has been\r\n     conferred belonging to a lower plane of being. But these\r\n     considerations go only to show the policy of granting suffrage to\r\n     women. From the stand-point of justice the argument is more\r\n     pressing. If woman asks for the ballot shall man deny it? By what\r\n     right? Certainly not by the right of a majority; for women are at\r\n     least as numerous. Certainly not by any right derived from\r\n     nature; for our common mother has set no brand on woman. If one\r\n     woman shall ask for a voice in the regulation of society of\r\n     which she is at least one-half, who shall say her nay? If any\r\n     woman shall ask it, who shall deny it because another woman does\r\n     not ask it? There are many men who do not value their\r\n     citizenship; shall other men therefore be deprived of the ballot?\r\n     Suppose many women would not avail themselves of such a function,\r\n     are those with higher, or other views, to be therefore kept in\r\n     tutelage?\r\n\r\n     I trust you may succeed in this work in Nebraska. It is of\r\n     supreme importance to the cause. The example of Nebraska would\r\n     soon be followed by other States. The current of such a reform\r\n     knows no retiring ebb. The suffrage once acquired will never be\r\n     relinquished; first, because it will recommend itself, as it has\r\n     in Wyoming, by its results; second, because the women will\r\n     jealously guard their rights, and defend them with their ballots.\r\n     Wishing I could do more than send you good wishes for the\r\n     cause,[94] I am, respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                             A. A. SARGENT.\r\n\r\nThe following letter is from a daughter of Elizabeth Cady Stanton\r\n(a graduate of Vassar College, and classmate of Miss Elizabeth\r\nPoppleton), who two years before, on the eve of her departure for\r\nEurope, gave her eloquent address on Edmund Burke in that city:\r\n\r\n                                   TOULOUSE, France, September 3, 1882.\r\n\r\n     _To the Voters of my Generation in Nebraska:_\r\n\r\n     It is not my desire to present to you any argument, but only to\r\n     give you an episode in my own life. I desire to lay before you a\r\n     fact, not a fiction; a reality, not a supposition; an experience\r\n     not a theory.\r\n\r\n     I was born in a free republic and in my veins runs very\r\n     rebellious blood. An ancestor of my father was one of those\r\n     intrepid men who left the shores of old England and sailed forth\r\n     to establish on a distant continent the grandest republic that\r\n     has ever yet been known. That, you see, is not good blood to\r\n     submit to injustice. And on my mother's side we find a sturdy old\r\n     Puritan from whom our stock is traced, fleeing from England\r\n     because of the faith that was in him, and joining his rebellious\r\n     life to one of that honest Holland nation which had defied so\r\n     nobly the oppressions of the Catholic church and Spanish\r\n     inquisition. As if this were not sufficiently independent blood\r\n     to pass on to other generations, my own father became an\r\n     abolitionist, and step by step fought his belief to victory, and\r\n     my mother early gave her efforts to the elevation of woman. It is\r\n     all this, together with my living in the freest land on the globe\r\n     and in a century rife with discussions of all principles of\r\n     government, that has made me in every fiber a believer in\r\n     republican institutions.\r\n\r\n     Having been reared in a large family of boys where we enjoyed\r\n     equal freedom, and having received the same collegiate education\r\n     as my brothers, it is not until lately that I have felt the crime\r\n     of my womanhood. I have dwelt thus upon the antecedents and\r\n     influences of my life in order to ask you one question: Do you\r\n     not think I can appreciate the real meaning, the true sacredness\r\n     of a republic? Do you not believe I feel the duties it demands\r\n     of its citizens? But I want you to hold your reply in abeyance,\r\n     till I give you one bit more of history.\r\n\r\n     A ship at sea crossing on the Atlantic between Europe and\r\n     America. Of two persons on this vessel I wish to speak to you. Of\r\n     one I have already told you much; I need but add that my two\r\n     years spent in Europe,[95] previous to my return to America for a\r\n     few months last winter, had not made me less American, less a\r\n     lover of republicanism. And now this ship, baffling the February\r\n     storm, was sweeping nearer the land where the people reign. My\r\n     heart beat high as I thought it was in my native country where\r\n     women were free, more honored than in any nation in the world. As\r\n     I stood on the deck, the strong sea-wind blowing wildly about me,\r\n     and the ocean bearing on its heart-wave mountains, visions of the\r\n     grandeur of the nation lying off beyond the western horizon, rose\r\n     before me. And it was a proud heart that cried--\"My Country!\"\r\n\r\n     And the other person I want to speak of? It is a man, a German,\r\n     coming to the United States to escape military service in\r\n     Prussia. He came in the steerage; was poor and ignorant. He could\r\n     speak no English, not one word of your language and mine. His\r\n     fellows were all Irish, so I offered to be an interpreter for\r\n     him. I visited the steerage quarters, and returned with a heavy\r\n     heart. Such brutal faces as I saw! Ignorance, cruelty,\r\n     subserviency, were everywhere depicted. Herds of human beings\r\n     that I feared, they looked so dull and brutal. The full meaning\r\n     of a terrible truth rushed upon me. Soon these men would be my\r\n     sovereigns--I their subject!\r\n\r\n     I had just spent a year in that German's native land, and I\r\n     remembered that I had seen their women doing the work of men in\r\n     the fields, husbands returning from their day's labor\r\n     empty-handed, and their wives toiling on behind bent under heavy\r\n     burdens, and as I thought on this, our ship bore him and me\r\n     towards the land that glories in having given birth to Lucretia\r\n     Mott. In the country where he had been reared, I had seen women\r\n     harnessed with beasts of burden, dragging laden wagons, and yet\r\n     our vessel carried him and me at each moment towards a safe\r\n     harbor, in a land that pays homage to the memory of Margaret\r\n     Fuller. Our ship sailed on, taking him from a land where he had\r\n     been taught to worship royalty, whatever its worth or crime;\r\n     where he had paid cringing submission to an arbitrary rule of\r\n     police; where he had been surrounded by the degrading effects of\r\n     the mightiest military system on the globe. The ship plowed on\r\n     and on through the waves, bringing him to a republic, not one\r\n     principle of which he comprehended.\r\n\r\n     And now we sail up New York bay. The day is bright, and a\r\n     softening haze hangs over all. Surely this is some vision-land.\r\n     Yes, it is indeed a vision-land, for it has never known the\r\n     presence of a royal line; against its oppressors it fought in no\r\n     mean rebellious spirit, but rose in revolution with its motto,\r\n     \"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\r\n     governed,\" written on its brow to be known of all men. And I\r\n     think as we slowly sail up the bay on our vessel, Does that\r\n     deadened soul respond to what lies before him? Does there in his\r\n     heart rise the prayer, Oh, God! make me true to the duties about\r\n     to be laid upon me; make me worthy of being free? Yes, then, for\r\n     the first time I felt the full depth of the indignity offered to\r\n     my womanhood. I felt my enthusiasm for America wavering--love of\r\n     country dead. _My_ country!--I have no country.\r\n\r\n     Young men of Nebraska, I ask you to free your minds from\r\n     prejudice, to be just towards the demands of another human soul,\r\n     to be frank, to be wholly truthful, and answer my demand: Why\r\n     should I not be a citizen of this republic? In replying, read\r\n     between the lines of my tedious story and bear in mind the words\r\n     of Voltaire: \"Who would dare change a law that time has\r\n     consecrated? Is there anything more respectable than an ancient\r\n     abuse! Reason is more ancient, replied Zadig.\"\r\n\r\n                                   Respectfully,      HARRIOT STANTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    MANCHESTER NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE, }\r\n                         MANCHESTER, England, September 5, 1882.    }\r\n\r\n     DEAR MISS ANTHONY: Will you accept a word of cheer and God-speed\r\n     from your sisters in England in your crusade for the emancipation\r\n     of woman in Nebraska? You carry with you the hopes and\r\n     sympathetic wishes of all on this side of the water. If you win,\r\n     as I trust you may, your victory will have a distinct influence\r\n     on the future of our parliamentary campaign, which we hope to\r\n     begin in early spring in England. In the name of English women I\r\n     would appeal to the men of Nebraska to assent to the great act of\r\n     justice to women which is proposed to them by their elected\r\n     representatives, and by so doing to aid in the enfranchisement of\r\n     women all over the world.\r\n\r\n                         Yours faithfully,         LYDIA E. BECKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        LONDON, September 1, 1882.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MISS ANTHONY: Having heard that the next convention of the\r\n     National Woman Suffrage Association will meet at Omaha this\r\n     month, I cannot refrain from sending a few lines to assure our\r\n     friends who are working so steadfastly in America for the same\r\n     sacred cause as our own, of our loving sympathy and good-wishes\r\n     for success in the coming struggle. The eyes and hearts of\r\n     hundreds of women are, like my own, turned to Nebraska, where so\r\n     momentous an issue is to be decided two months hence. The news of\r\n     their vote, if rightly given, will \"echo round the world\" like\r\n     the first shot fired at Concord. It will be the expression of\r\n     their determination to establish their freedom by giving freedom\r\n     to others, and their example will be followed by Indiana and\r\n     Oregon, and soon by the other States of the Union and by England.\r\n     Everything points with us to a speedy triumph of the principle of\r\n     equal justice for woman. Next November, about the time when\r\n     Nebraska will be voting for equal suffrage, the women in Scotland\r\n     will be voting for the first time in their municipal elections.\r\n     The session of 1882 will be memorable in future for having passed\r\n     the act which gives a married woman the right to hold her own\r\n     property, make contracts, sue and be sued, in the same manner as\r\n     if she were a single woman. It is nearly thirty years since we\r\n     first began our efforts in this matter, and each succeeding step\r\n     has been won very slowly and with great difficulty through the\r\n     efforts of those who are working to obtain the suffrage. Mr.\r\n     Gladstone still expresses the hope that next session will place\r\n     the franchise on a \"fair\" basis, meaning thereby the same right\r\n     of voting for counties as for boroughs. We maintain that the\r\n     franchise can never be said to be on a fair basis while women are\r\n     debarred from the right of voting. Our progress and your progress\r\n     will keep even pace together, for if women are free in America no\r\n     long time can elapse before they are free here. We can but offer\r\n     you our sympathy and we beg this favor of you, that as soon as\r\n     you have the returns of the vote ascertained, you will telegraph\r\n     the news to us, that our English societies may keep the day of\r\n     rejoicing heart in heart with the American National Association.\r\n\r\n     With cordial sympathy in all your efforts, I am, faithfully\r\n     yours,\r\n\r\n                                             CAROLYN ASHURST BIGGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _To the National Woman Suffrage Association, in Convention\r\n     assembled, at Omaha, Nebraska, September 26, 27, 28:_\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIENDS: The most pressing work before the National Woman\r\n     Suffrage Convention, is bringing all its forces to bear upon\r\n     congress for the submission of a sixteenth amendment to the\r\n     national constitution, which shall prohibit States from\r\n     disfranchising citizens of the United States, on the ground of\r\n     sex, or for any cause not equally applicable to all citizens.\r\n     While we of the National are glad to see an amendment to a State\r\n     constitution proposed, securing suffrage to woman, as is the case\r\n     in Nebraska this fall, we must not be led by it to forget or\r\n     neglect our legitimate work, an amendment to the national\r\n     constitution, which will secure suffrage at one and the same\r\n     moment to the women of each State. While all action of any kind\r\n     and everywhere is good because it is educational, the only real,\r\n     legitimate work of the National Woman Suffrage Association, is\r\n     upon congress. Never have our prospects been brighter than\r\n     to-day. A select committee on woman suffrage having been\r\n     appointed in both houses during the last session of congress, and\r\n     a resolution introduced in the Senate, proposing an amendment to\r\n     the Constitution of the United States, to secure the right of\r\n     suffrage to all citizens irrespective of sex, having been\r\n     referred to this select committee and receiving a favorable\r\n     majority report thereon, we have every reason to expect the\r\n     submission of such an amendment at the next session of congress.\r\n\r\n     The work then, most necessary, is with each representative and\r\n     senator; and the legislatures of the several States should be\r\n     induced to pass resolutions requesting the senators and\r\n     representatives from each State to give voice and vote in favor\r\n     of the submission of such an amendment. This work is vitally\r\n     important for the coming winter, and none the less so, even\r\n     should Nebraska vote aye November 7, upon the woman suffrage\r\n     amendment to its own constitution. In view of the probability of\r\n     the submission of a sixteenth amendment at the coming session of\r\n     congress, I offer the following resolution, which I consider one\r\n     of the most important of the series I have been asked to prepare\r\n     for adoption by the convention:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That it is the duty of every woman to work with\r\n          the legislature of her own State, to secure from it the\r\n          passage of a joint resolution requesting its senators and\r\n          representatives in congress to use voice and vote in favor\r\n          of the submission of an amendment to the national\r\n          constitution which shall prohibit States from disfranchising\r\n          citizens on the ground of sex.\r\n\r\n     I hope the above resolution will be unanimously adopted, and that\r\n     each woman will strive to carry its provisions into effect as a\r\n     religious duty. With my best wishes for a grand and successful\r\n     convention, and the hope that Nebraska will set itself right\r\n     before the world by the adoption of the woman suffrage amendment\r\n     this fall, I am,\r\n\r\n                         Very truly yours,     MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE.[96]\r\n\r\n_The Republican_ in describing the closing scenes of the\r\nconvention, said:\r\n\r\n     Fully 2,500 people assembled last evening to listen to the\r\n     closing proceedings of the convention. The stage, which was\r\n     beautifully furnished and upholstered, was completely occupied by\r\n     the ladies of the Association; and as they all were in full\r\n     dress, in preparation for the reception at the Paxton Hotel, the\r\n     sight was a brilliant one. As respects the audience, not only the\r\n     seats, but the lobbies were crowded, and hundreds upon hundreds\r\n     were turned away. Manager Boyd remarked as we passed in, \"You\r\n     will see to-night the most magnificent gathering that has ever\r\n     been in the Opera House,\" and such truly it was--the intellect,\r\n     fashion and refinement of the city. Addresses were given by M'me\r\n     Neyman, whose earnest and eloquent words were breathlessly heard;\r\n     Mrs. Minor of St. Louis, whose utterances were serious and\r\n     weighty; and Miss Phoebe Couzins, who touched the springs of\r\n     sentiment, sympathy, pathos and humor by turns. After answering\r\n     two or three objections that had not been fully touched upon,\r\n     Miss Couzins fairly carried away the house, when she said in\r\n     conclusion, \"Miss Anthony and myself, and another who has\r\n     addressed you are the only spinsters in the movement. We, indeed,\r\n     expect to marry, but we don't want our husbands to marry slaves\r\n     [great merriment]; we are waiting for our enfranchisement. And\r\n     now, if you want Miss Anthony and myself to move into your\r\n     State--\" this hit, with all it implied, set the audience into a\r\n     convulsion of cheers and laughter which was quite prolonged; and\r\n     after the merriment had subsided, Miss Couzins completed her\r\n     sentence by saying, \"We are under sailing orders to receive\r\n     proposals!\" whereupon the applause broke out afresh. \"However,\"\r\n     she added, seeing Miss Anthony shake her head, \"it takes a very\r\n     superior woman to be an old maid, and on this principle I think\r\n     Miss Anthony will stick to her colors.\" Miss Couzins quoted\r\n     Hawthorne as speaking through \"Zenobia\":\r\n\r\n          \"It is my belief, yea, my prophecy, that when my sex shall\r\n          have attained its freedom there will be ten eloquent women\r\n          where there is now one eloquent man,\" and instanced this\r\n          convention as an illustration of what might be expected.\r\n\r\nMiss Couzins was followed by Mrs. Saxon, Mrs. Neyman and Miss\r\nHindman. The resolutions,[97] which were presented by Mrs. Sewall,\r\namong their personal commendations expressed the appreciation of\r\nthe Association for the services rendered by Mrs. Clara Bewick\r\nColby, in making preparations for the convention. Mrs. Colby in\r\nmaking her acknowledgments said:\r\n\r\n     There was another to whom the Association owed much for the work\r\n     done which has made possible the brilliant success of the\r\n     convention--one to whom, while across the water their thoughts\r\n     and hearts had often turned; and she was sure that all present\r\n     would gladly join in extending a welcome to the late president,\r\n     and now chairman of the executive committee of the State\r\n     association, Mrs. Harriet S. Brooks.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brooks came forward amid applause, and said:\r\n\r\n     That at this late hour while a speech might be silvern, silence\r\n     was golden; and she would say no more than, on behalf of all the\r\n     members and officers of the State association, and the friends of\r\n     the cause in Omaha, to tender their most grateful thanks to the\r\n     National Association for \"the feast of reason and the flow of\r\n     soul\" with which they have been favored during the last three\r\n     days.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the convention the spacious parlors of the Paxton\r\nHouse were crowded. Over a thousand ladies and gentlemen passed\r\nthrough, shaking hands with the delegates and congratulating them\r\non the great success of the convention.\r\n\r\nAnother enthusiastic meeting was held at Lincoln, the capital of\r\nthe State, and radiating from this point in all directions these\r\nmissionaries of the new gospel of woman's equality traversed the\r\nentire State, scattering tracts and holding meetings in churches,\r\nschool-houses and the open air, and thus the agitation was kept up\r\nuntil the day of election. As it was the season for agricultural\r\nfairs, the people were more easily drawn together, and the ladies\r\nreadily availed themselves, as they had opportunity, of these great\r\ngatherings. Two notable debates were held in Omaha in answer to the\r\nmany challenges sent by the opposition. Miss Couzins, the first to\r\nenter the arena, was obliged to help her antagonist in his\r\nscriptural quotations, while Miss Anthony was compelled to supply\r\nhers with well-known statistics. It was evident that neither of the\r\ngentlemen had sharpened his weapons for the encounter.\r\n\r\nTo look over the list of counties visited and the immense distances\r\ntraveled in public and private conveyances, enables one in a\r\nmeasure to appreciate the physical fatigue these ladies endured. In\r\nreading of their earnest speeches, debates, conversations at every\r\nfireside and dinner-table, in every car and carriage as they\r\njourneyed by the way or waited at the station, their untiring\r\nperseverance must command the unqualified admiration of those who\r\nknow what a political campaign involves. During those six weeks of\r\nintense excitement they were alike hopeful and anxious as to the\r\nresult. At last the day dawned when the momentous question of the\r\nenfranchisement of 75,000 women was to be decided. Every train\r\nbrought some of the speakers to their headquarters in Omaha, with\r\ncheering news from the different localities they had canvassed. And\r\nnow one last effort must be made, they must see what can be done at\r\nthe polls. Some of the ladies went in carriages to each of the\r\npolling booths and made earnest appeals to those who were to vote\r\nfor or against the woman's amendment. Others stood dispensing\r\nrefreshments and the tickets they wished to see voted, all day\r\nlong. And while the men sipped their coffee and ate their viands\r\nwith evident relish, the women appealed to their sense of justice,\r\nto their love of liberty and republican institutions. Vain would be\r\nthe attempt to describe the patient waiting, the fond hopes, the\r\nbright visions of coming freedom, that had nerved these brave women\r\nto these untiring labors, or to shadow in colors dark enough the\r\nfears, the anxieties, the disappointments, all centered in that\r\nNovember election. A fitting subject for an historical picture was\r\nthat group of intensely earnest women gathered there, as the last\r\nrays of the setting sun warned them that whether for weal or for\r\nwoe the decisive hour had come; no word of theirs could turn defeat\r\nto victory.\r\n\r\nThe hours of anxious waiting were not long, the verdict soon came\r\nflashing on every wire, from the north, the south, the west: \"No!\"\r\n\"No!\" \"No!\" The mothers, wives and daughters of Nebraska must still\r\nwear the yoke of slavery; they who endured with man the hardships\r\nof the early days and bravely met the dangers of a pioneer life,\r\nthey who have reared two generations of boys and taught them the\r\nelements of all they know, who have stood foremost in all good\r\nworks of charity and reform, who appreciate the genius of free\r\ninstitutions, native-born American citizens, are still to be\r\ngoverned by the ignorant, vicious classes from the old world. What\r\na verdict was this for one of the youngest States in the American\r\nrepublic in the nineteenth century!\r\n\r\nBut these heroic women did not sit down in sackcloth and ashes to\r\nweep over the cruel verdict. Anticipating victory, they had engaged\r\nthe Opera House to hold their jubilee if the women of Nebraska were\r\nenfranchised; or, if the returns brought them no cause for\r\nrejoicing, they would at least exalt the educational work that had\r\nbeen done in the State, and dedicate themselves anew to this\r\nstruggle for liberty. They had survived three defeats, in Kansas,\r\nMichigan, Colorado, and tasted the bitterness of repeated\r\ndisappointments, and another could not crush them. When the hour\r\narrived, an immense audience welcomed them in the Opera House, and\r\nfrom this new baptism of sorrow they spoke more eloquently than\r\never before. In their calm, determined manner they seemed to say\r\nwith Milton's hero:\r\n\r\n     \"All is not lost: the unconquerable will is ours.\"\r\n\r\nA report of the Fifteenth Annual Washington Convention, Jan. 23,\r\n24, 25, 1883, was written by Miss Jessie Waite of Chicago, and\r\npublished in the _Washington Chronicle_, from which we give the\r\nfollowing extracts:\r\n\r\n     The proceedings of the Association were inaugurated at Lincoln\r\n     Hall Monday evening by a novel lecture, entitled \"Zekle's Wife,\"\r\n     by Mrs. Amy Talbot Dunn of Indianapolis. The personality of Mrs.\r\n     Dunn is so entirely lost in that of Zekle's wife that it is hard\r\n     to realize that the old lady of so many and so varied experiences\r\n     is a happy young wife. As a character sketch Mrs. Dunn's \"Zekle's\r\n     Wife\" stands on an equality with Denman Thompson's \"Joshua\r\n     Whitcomb\" and with Joe Jefferson's \"Rip Van Winkle.\" To sustain a\r\n     conception so foreign to the natural characteristics of the actor\r\n     without once allowing the interest of the audience to flag,\r\n     requires originality of thought, independence of idea, and genius\r\n     for action. Mrs. Dunn, herself the author of her sketch,\r\n     possesses to a remarkable degree the power to impress upon her\r\n     audience the feeling that the old lady from \"Kaintuck\" is before\r\n     them, not only to say things for their amusement, but also to\r\n     impress upon them those great truths which have presented\r\n     themselves to her mind during the fifty years of her married\r\n     life. \"Zekle's Wife\" is a keen, shrewd, warm-hearted, lovable old\r\n     woman, without education or culture, yet with an innate sense of\r\n     refinement and a touching undercurrent of desire \"not to be too\r\n     hard on Zekle.\" As she tells her story, which she informs us is a\r\n     true one from real life, she engages the attention and wins the\r\n     sympathy of all her hearers, and frequent bursts of applause\r\n     evidence the satisfaction of the audience.\r\n\r\n     The convention proper opened on Tuesday morning with the\r\n     appointment of various committees,[98] and reports[99] from the\r\n     different States filled up most of the time during the day. May\r\n     Wright Sewall said:\r\n\r\n          Women must learn that power gives power; that intelligence\r\n          alone can appreciate or be influenced by intelligence; that\r\n          justice alone is moved by appeals based on justice. More\r\n          than anything in the course of suffrage labor does the\r\n          Nebraska campaign justify the primary method of this\r\n          National Association. We have a right to expect that each\r\n          legislature will be composed of the picked men of the State.\r\n          We have a right to believe that as the intelligence, wisdom\r\n          and justice of the picked men of the nation are superior to\r\n          the same qualities in the mass of men, so is the fitness of\r\n          national and State legislators to consider the demands for\r\n          the ballot.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Mills of Washington sang, as a solo, \"Barbara Fritchie,\" in\r\n     excellent style. Mrs. Caroline Hallowell Miller (wife of Francis\r\n     Miller, esq., late assistant attorney for the District of\r\n     Columbia) spoke with the greatest ease and most remarkable\r\n     command of language. She is in every sense a strong woman. She\r\n     said that, born and reared as she was in a Virginia town noted\r\n     for its intense conservatism, where she had seen a woman stripped\r\n     to the waist and brutally beaten by order of the law (her skin\r\n     happened to be of a dark color) whose only crime was that of\r\n     alleged impertinence, and that impertinence provoked by improper\r\n     conduct on the part of a young man; that, reared in such a cradle\r\n     as this, still, through the blessing of a good home, she had\r\n     learned to deeply appreciate the noble efforts of women who dared\r\n     to tread new paths, to break their own way through the dense\r\n     forest of prejudice and ignorance. Man cannot represent woman. If\r\n     woman breaks any law of man, of nature, or of God, she alone must\r\n     suffer the penalty. \"This fact seems to me,\" said Mrs. Miller,\r\n     \"to settle the whole question.\"\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony read the following letter from Hon. Benjamin F.\r\n     Butler, who, she said, had the honor of being an advocate of this\r\n     cause, in addition to being governor of Massachusetts:\r\n\r\n                                   WASHINGTON, D. C., Jan. 23, 1883.\r\n\r\n          MY DEAR MISS ANTHONY: I received your kind note asking me to\r\n          attend the National Convention of the friends of woman\r\n          suffrage at Washington, for which courtesy I am obliged. My\r\n          engagements, which have taken me out of the commonwealth,\r\n          cover all, and more than all, of my time, and I find I am to\r\n          hurry back, leaving some of them undisposed of. It will\r\n          therefore be impossible for me to attend the convention.\r\n\r\n          As I have already declared my conviction that the fourteenth\r\n          amendment fully covers the right of all persons to vote, and\r\n          as I assume that the women of the country are persons, and\r\n          very important persons to its happiness and prosperity, I\r\n          never have been able to see any reason why women do not come\r\n          within its provisions. I think such will be the decision of\r\n          the court, perhaps quite as early as you may be able to get\r\n          through congress and the legislatures of the several States\r\n          another amendment. But both lines of action may well be\r\n          followed, as they do not conflict with each other. This\r\n          course was taken in the case of the fifteenth amendment,\r\n          which was supposed to be necessary to cover the case of the\r\n          negro, although many of the friends of the colored man\r\n          looked coldly upon that amendment, because it seemed to be\r\n          an admission that the fourteenth amendment was not\r\n          sufficient. Therefore I can without inconsistency, I think,\r\n          bid you \"God speed\" in your agitation for the sixteenth\r\n          amendment. It will have the effect to enlighten the public\r\n          mind as to the scope of the fourteenth amendment. I am very\r\n          truly, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\n                                             BENJ. F. BUTLER.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Blake presented a series of resolutions, which were laid on\r\n     the table for consideration:\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, In larger numbers than ever before the women of the\r\n          United States are demanding the repeal of arbitrary\r\n          restrictions which now debar them from the use of the\r\n          ballot; and\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, The recent defeat in Nebraska of a constitutional\r\n          amendment, giving the women of the State the right to vote,\r\n          proves that failure is the natural result of an appeal to\r\n          the masses on a question which is best understood and\r\n          approved by the more intelligent citizens; therefore,\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That we call upon this congress to pass, without\r\n          delay, the sixteenth amendment to the federal constitution\r\n          now pending in the Senate.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That all competitive examinations for places in\r\n          the civil service of the United States should be open on\r\n          equal terms to citizens of both sexes, and that any\r\n          so-called civil service reform that does not correct the\r\n          existing unjust discrimination against women employes, and\r\n          grade all salaries on merit and not sex, is a dishonest\r\n          pretense at reform.\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, The Constitution of the United States declares that\r\n          no State shall be admitted to the Union unless it have a\r\n          republican form of government; and whereas, no true republic\r\n          can exist unless all the inhabitants are given equal civil\r\n          and political rights; therefore,\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That we earnestly protest against the admission\r\n          of Dakota as a State, unless the right of suffrage is\r\n          secured on equal terms to all her citizens.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the women of these United States have not\r\n          deserved the infliction of this punishment of\r\n          disfranchisement, and do most earnestly demand that they be\r\n          relieved from the cruelties it imposes upon them.\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, During the war hundreds of women throughout our\r\n          land entered the service of the nation as hospital nurses;\r\n          and\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, Many of these women were disabled by wounds and by\r\n          disease, while many were reduced to permanent invalidism by\r\n          the hardships they endured; therefore,\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That these women should be placed on the pension\r\n          list and rewarded for their services.\r\n\r\n     After the reading of the resolutions an animated discussion\r\n     followed, Miss Anthony showing in scathing terms the injustice of\r\n     the employment of women to do equal work with men at half the\r\n     salaries, in the departments at Washington and elsewhere. An\r\n     additional resolution was adopted declaring that paying Dr. Susan\r\n     A. Edson for her services as attendant physician to President\r\n     Garfield, $1,000 less than was paid for an equivalent service\r\n     rendered by Dr. Boynton, a more recent graduate of the same\r\n     college from which she received her diploma, is an unjust\r\n     discrimination on account of sex.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. SEWALL said men in the departments were given extra\r\n          leave of absence each year to go home to vote, and suggested\r\n          that women be given (until the time comes for them to vote)\r\n          extra leave to meditate upon the ballot.\r\n\r\n          Miss ANTHONY said she had addressed a letter to each\r\n          secretary asking that such women as desired be given\r\n          permission to attend the meetings of this convention without\r\n          loss of time to them. She had received but one answer, which\r\n          was from Secretary Folger, who wrote: \"_The condition of the\r\n          public business prevents us from acceding to your request_.\"\r\n\r\n          Mrs. HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK of Boston said: Tired as some of\r\n          the audience must be of hearing the same old argument in\r\n          favor of the ballot for women repeated from year to year,\r\n          they could not possibly be more tired than the friends of\r\n          the cause were of hearing the same old objections repeated\r\n          from year to year. While the forty-year-old objections are\r\n          raised the forty-year-old rejoinders must be given. We must\r\n          continue to agitate until we force people to listen. It is\r\n          like the ringing of a bell. At first no one notices it; in a\r\n          little while, a few will listen; finally, the perpetual\r\n          ding-dong, ding-dong, will force itself to be heard by every\r\n          one. The oldest of all the old arguments is that of right\r\n          and justice, and the tune which my little bell shall ring is\r\n          merely this: \"_It is right!_\" This cry of woman for liberty\r\n          and equality increases every day, and it is a cry that must\r\n          some day be heard and responded to.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Virginia L. Minor of St. Louis was then introduced as the\r\n     woman who stands to this cause in the same relation that Dred\r\n     Scott had stood to the Republican party. Miss Couzins said that\r\n     in introducing Mrs. Minor she wanted to say one word about the\r\n     work Mrs. Minor had done for the soldiers, during the sanitary\r\n     fair and all through the war. She had canned fruit, refusing the\r\n     money offered in payment, returning it all to be used for the\r\n     sick and wounded soldiers [applause]. Mrs. Minor spoke in a calm,\r\n     deliberate manner, with perfect conviction in the truth of her\r\n     statements and with a winning sweetness of expression that\r\n     indicated the highest sensibilities of a refined nature. She\r\n     showed that women voted in the early days of the country, and\r\n     that undoubtedly it was the intention of the framers of the\r\n     constitution that they should do so. This right had been taken\r\n     away when the constitution was amended and the word \"male\"\r\n     inserted. What is now desired is simply restoration of that which\r\n     had been taken away. She believed that this restoration was made,\r\n     unwittingly, by the addition of the fourteenth amendment, which,\r\n     without doubt, makes women citizens. It is men who have abused\r\n     the republican institution of suffrage; it is women who desire to\r\n     restore it to its proper exercise. Miss Anthony read a letter\r\n     from Mrs. Wallace, the wife of one of the former governors of\r\n     Indiana:\r\n\r\n                              INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., January 21, 1883.\r\n\r\n          DEAR MISS ANTHONY: When in the call I read that for fourteen\r\n          consecutive years the National Woman Suffrage Association\r\n          had held a convention in Washington, I was oppressed by two\r\n          thoughts: First, how hard it is to overcome prejudice and\r\n          ignorance when they have been fortified by the usages and\r\n          customs of ages; and secondly, the sublime faith, courage\r\n          and perseverance of the advocates of woman's\r\n          enfranchisement, and their confidence in the ultimate\r\n          triumph of justice. After all, by what are governments\r\n          organized and maintained? By brute force alone? Despotisms\r\n          may be, but republics never. What are the qualifications for\r\n          the ballot? The power to fight? Are they not rather\r\n          intelligence, virtue, truth and patriotism? I scarce think\r\n          the most obstinate and egotistical of our opponents will\r\n          assert that men possess a monopoly of these virtues, or even\r\n          a moiety of them. As to their fighting capacities, of which\r\n          we hear so much, I think they would have cut a sorry figure\r\n          in the wars which they have been compelled to wage in order\r\n          to establish and maintain this government, if they had not\r\n          had the sympathy and cooeperation of woman. I entirely agree\r\n          with you that, while agitation in the States is necessary as\r\n          a means of education, a sixteenth amendment to the national\r\n          constitution is the quickest, surest and least laborious way\r\n          to secure the success of this great work for human liberty.\r\n          Any legislature of Indiana in the last six years would have\r\n          ratified such an amendment. With highest regards for\r\n          yourself and the best wishes for the success of the\r\n          convention, I remain,\r\n\r\n                         Yours, etc.,     ZERELDA G. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n     After several other speakers,[100] Madame Clara Neyman of New\r\n     York city, delivered what was, without question, one of the best\r\n     addresses of the convention. She spoke with a slightly German\r\n     accent, which only served to enhance the interest and hold the\r\n     attention of the audience. Her eloquence and argument could not\r\n     fail to convince all of her earnest purpose. After showing the\r\n     philosophy of reform movements, and every step of progress, she\r\n     said:\r\n\r\n          Woman's enfranchisement will be wrought out by peaceful\r\n          means. We shall use no fire-arms, no torpedoes, no heavy\r\n          guns to gain our freedom. No precious human lives will be\r\n          sacrificed; no tears will be shed to establish our right. We\r\n          shall capture the fortresses of prejudice and injustice by\r\n          the force of our arguments; we shall send shell after shell\r\n          into these strongholds until their defective reasoning gives\r\n          way to victorious truth. \"Inability to bear arms,\" says\r\n          Herbert Spencer, \"was the reason given in feudal times for\r\n          excluding woman from succession,\" and to-day her position is\r\n          lowest where the military spirit prevails. A sad\r\n          illustration of this is my own country. Being a born German,\r\n          and in feeling, kindred, and patriotism attached to the\r\n          country of my birth and childhood, it is hard for me to make\r\n          such a confession. But the truth must be told, even if it\r\n          hurts. It has been observed by those who travel in Europe,\r\n          that Germany, which has the finest and best universities,\r\n          which stands highest in scholarship, nevertheless tolerates,\r\n          nay, enforces the subjection of woman. The freedom of a\r\n          country stands in direct relation to the position of its\r\n          women. America, which has proclaimed the freedom of man, has\r\n          developed _pari passu_ a finer womanhood, and has done more\r\n          for us than any other nation in existence. A new type of\r\n          manhood has been reared on American soil--a type which\r\n          Tennyson describes in his Princess:\r\n\r\n               Man shall be more of woman, she of man;\r\n               He gain in sweetness and in moral height,\r\n               Nor lose the thews that wrestle with the world;\r\n               She, mental breadth, nor fail in childward care,\r\n               Nor lose the childlike in the larger mind;\r\n               Till at the last they set them each to each,\r\n               Like perfect music unto noble words.\r\n               Then comes the statelier Eden back to man;\r\n               Then springs the crowning race of human kind.\r\n\r\n     At the evening session the time was divided between Lillie\r\n     Devereux Blake and Phoebe W. Couzins. Mrs. Blake spoke on the\r\n     question, \"Is it a Crime to be a Woman?\"\r\n\r\n          She showed in a clear, logical manner that wherever a woman\r\n          was apprehended for crime the discrimination against her was\r\n          not because of the crime she had committed, but because the\r\n          crime was committed by a woman. Every woman in this country\r\n          is treated by the law as if she were to blame for being a\r\n          woman. In New York an honorable married woman has no right\r\n          to her children. A man may beat his wife all he pleases; but\r\n          if he beats another man the law immediately interferes,\r\n          showing that the woman is not protected simply because she\r\n          is so indiscreet as to _be a woman_. If it is not a crime to\r\n          be a woman, why are women subjected to unequal payment with\r\n          men for the same service? Why are they forced at times to\r\n          don men's clothes in order to obtain employment that will\r\n          keep them from starvation?\r\n\r\n          Miss COUZINS said that the American-born woman was \"a woman\r\n          without a country\"; but before she had closed she had proved\r\n          that this country belonged exclusively to the women. It was\r\n          a woman, Queen Isabella, that enabled a man to discover this\r\n          country, and in the old flag the initials were \"I\" and \"F,\"\r\n          representing Isabella and Ferdinand, showing that it was\r\n          acknowledged that the woman's initial was the more important\r\n          in this matter and to be first considered. It was a woman,\r\n          Mary Chilton, that first landed on Plymouth rock. It was a\r\n          woman, Betsy Ross, that designed our beautiful flag, the\r\n          original eagle on our silver dollar, and the seal of the\r\n          United States without which no money is legal. All the way\r\n          down in our national history woman has been hand in hand\r\n          with man, has assisted, supported and encouraged him, and\r\n          now there are women ready to help reform the life of the\r\n          body politic, and side by side with man work to purify,\r\n          refine and ennoble the world. Miss Couzins seemed Inspired\r\n          by her own thoughts and carried the audience along with her\r\n          in her flights of eloquence.\r\n\r\n     Being asked to make a few closing remarks, Mrs. May Wright Sewall\r\n     said:\r\n\r\n          Difficult, indeed, is the task of closing a three days'\r\n          convention; vain is the hope to do it with fitting words\r\n          which shall not be mere repetitions of what has been said on\r\n          this platform. The truth which bases this claim lies in a\r\n          nut-shell, and the shell seems hard to be cracked. It is\r\n          unfair, when comparing the ability of men and women, to\r\n          compare the average woman to the exceptional man, but this\r\n          is what man always does. If, perchance, he admits not only\r\n          the equality but the superiority of woman, he tells her she\r\n          must not vote because she is so nearly an angel, so much\r\n          better than he is, and this, in the face of the fact that\r\n          every angel represented or revealed has been shown in the\r\n          form of a _handsome young man_. If any class then must\r\n          abstain from meddling in politics on account of relation to\r\n          the angels, it is the men! But she informed the gentlemen\r\n          she had no fears for them on that ground, for their\r\n          relationship was not _near_ enough to cause any serious\r\n          inconvenience. Speaking of the objections to women\r\n          undertaking grave or deep studies, that woman lacks the\r\n          logical faculty, that she has only intuition, nerve-force,\r\n          etc., Mrs. Sewall said: It is true of every woman who has\r\n          done the worthiest work in science, literature, or reform,\r\n          from Diotima, the teacher of Socrates, to Margaret Fuller,\r\n          the pupil of Channing and the peer of Emerson, that ignoring\r\n          the methods of nerves and instincts, she has placed herself\r\n          squarely on the basis of observation, investigation and\r\n          reason. Men will admit that these women had strength and\r\n          logic, but say they are exceptional women. So are Gladstone,\r\n          Bismarck, Gambetta, Lincoln and Garfield exceptional men.\r\n          She mentioned Miss Anthony's proposed trip to Europe, and\r\n          said that she had not had a holiday for thirty years.\r\n\r\n          Miss ANTHONY said she wished to call attention to the report\r\n          of the Special Committee of the Senate, which distinctly\r\n          stated that the question had had \"general agitation,\" and\r\n          that the petitions at different times presented were both\r\n          \"_numerous_ and respectable.\" This was sufficient answer,\r\n          coming from such high authority, that of Senator Anthony, to\r\n          all the insinuations and unjust remarks about the petitions\r\n          presented to congress, and with regard to the assertion that\r\n          women themselves did not want the ballot. She expressed her\r\n          obligations to the press, and mentioned that the _Sunday\r\n          Chronicle_ had announced its intention of giving much\r\n          valuable space to the proceedings, and that when she had\r\n          learned this, she had ordered 1,000 copies, which she would\r\n          send to the address of any friend in the audience free of\r\n          charge.\r\n\r\n     The \"Star Spangled Banner\" was then sung, Miss Couzins and Mrs.\r\n     Shattuck singing the solos, Mr. Wilson of the Foundry M. E.\r\n     Church, leading the audience in the chorus, the whole producing a\r\n     fine effect. Miss Anthony said the audience could see how much\r\n     better it was to have a man to help, even in singing. This\r\n     brought down the house.\r\n\r\n     In closing this report, a word may be said of the persons most\r\n     conspicuous in it. This year several remarkable additions have\r\n     been made to our number, and it is of these especially that we\r\n     would speak. Mrs. Minor of St. Louis, in her manner has all the\r\n     gentleness and sweetness of the high-born Southern lady; her\r\n     personal appearance is very pleasant, her hair a light chestnut,\r\n     untouched with gray; her face has lost the color of youth, but\r\n     her eyes have still their fire, toned down by the sorrow they\r\n     have seen. Madame Neyman is also new to the Washington platform.\r\n     She is a piquant little German lady, with vivacious manner, most\r\n     agreeable accent, and looked in her closely-fitting black-velvet\r\n     dress as if she might have just stepped out of a painting. In\r\n     direct contrast is Mrs. Miller of Maryland--a large, dark-haired\r\n     matron, past middle age, but newly born in her enthusiasm for the\r\n     cause. She is a worker as well as a talker, and is a decided\r\n     acquisition to the ranks. The other novice in the work is Mrs.\r\n     Amy Dunn, who has taken such a novel way to render assistance.\r\n     Mrs. Dunn is tall and slender, with dark hair and eyes. She is a\r\n     shrewd observer, does not talk much socially, but when she says\r\n     anything it is to the point. Her character sketch, \"Zekle's\r\n     Wife,\" will be a stepping-stone to many a woman on her way to the\r\n     suffrage platform.\r\n\r\n     Two women who have done and are doing a great work in this city,\r\n     and who are not among the public speakers, are Mrs. Spofford, the\r\n     treasurer, wife of the proprietor of the Riggs House, and Miss\r\n     Ellen H. Sheldon, secretary of the Association. To these ladies\r\n     is due much of the success of the convention. Mrs. Sheldon is of\r\n     diminutive stature, with gray hair, and Mrs. Spofford is of large\r\n     and queenly figure, with white hair. Her magnificent presence is\r\n     always remarked at the meetings.\r\n\r\n     The following were among the letters read at this convention:\r\n\r\n              10 DUCHESS STREET, PORTLAND PLACE, LONDON, Eng., Jan. 12.\r\n\r\n          DEAR MISS ANTHONY: To you and our friends in convention\r\n          assembled, I send greeting from the old world. It needs but\r\n          little imagination to bring Lincoln Hall, the usual fine\r\n          audiences, and the well-known faces on the platform, before\r\n          my mind, so familiar have fifteen years of these conventions\r\n          in Washington made such scenes to me. How many times, as I\r\n          have sat in your midst and listened to the grand speeches of\r\n          my noble coaedjutors, I have wondered how much longer we\r\n          should be called upon to rehearse the oft-repeated arguments\r\n          in favor of equal rights to all. Surely the grand\r\n          declarations of statesmen at every period in our history\r\n          should make the principle of equality so self-evident as to\r\n          end at once all class legislation.\r\n\r\n          It is now over half a century since Frances Wright with\r\n          eloquent words first asserted the political rights of women\r\n          in our republic; and from that day to this, inspired\r\n          apostles in an unbroken line of succession have proclaimed\r\n          the new gospel of the motherhood of God and of humanity. We\r\n          have plead our case in conventions of the people, in halls\r\n          of legislation, before committees of congress, and in the\r\n          Supreme Court of the United States, and our arguments still\r\n          remain unanswered. History shows no record of a fact like\r\n          this, where so large a class of virtuous, educated,\r\n          native-born citizens have been subjugated by the national\r\n          government to foreign domination. While our American\r\n          statesmen scorn the thought that even the most gifted son of\r\n          a monarch, an emperor or a czar should ever occupy the proud\r\n          position of a president of these United States, and by\r\n          constitutional provision deny to all foreigners this high\r\n          privilege, they yet allow the very riff-raff of the old\r\n          world to make laws for the proudest women of the republic,\r\n          to make the moral code for the daughters of our people, to\r\n          sit in judgment on all our domestic relations.\r\n\r\n          England has taken two grand steps within the last year in\r\n          extending the municipal suffrage to the woman of Scotland\r\n          and in passing the Married Woman's Property bill. They are\r\n          holding meetings all over the country now in favor of\r\n          parliamentary suffrage. Statistics show that women generally\r\n          _exercise_ the rights already accorded. They have recently\r\n          passed through a very heated election for members of the\r\n          school-board in various localities. Miss Lydia Becker was\r\n          elected in Manchester, and Miss Eva Mueller in one of the\r\n          districts of London, and several other women in different\r\n          cities.\r\n\r\n          A little incident will show you how naturally the political\r\n          equality of woman is coming about in Queen Victoria's\r\n          dominions. I was invited to dine at Barn Elms, a beautiful\r\n          estate on the banks of the Thames, a spot full of classic\r\n          associations, the residence of Mr. Charles McLaren, a member\r\n          of parliament. Opposite me at dinner sat a bright young girl\r\n          tastefully attired; on my right the gentleman to whom she\r\n          was engaged; at the head of the table a sparkling matron of\r\n          twenty-five, one of the most popular speakers here on the\r\n          woman suffrage platform. The dinner-table talk was such as\r\n          might be heard in any cultivated circle--art, literature,\r\n          amusements, passing events, etc., etc.--and when the repast\r\n          was finished, ladies and gentlemen, in full dinner dress,\r\n          went off to attend an important school-board meeting, our\r\n          host to preside and the young lady opposite me to make the\r\n          speech of the evening, and all done in as matter-of-fact a\r\n          way as if the party were going to the opera. Members of\r\n          parliament and lord-mayors preside and speak at all their\r\n          public meetings and help in every way to carry on the\r\n          movement, giving money most liberally; and yet how seldom\r\n          any of our senators or congressmen will even speak at our\r\n          meetings, to say nothing of sending us a check of fifty or a\r\n          hundred dollars. I trust that we shall accomplish enough\r\n          this year to place the women of republican America at least\r\n          on an even platform with monarchical England. With sincere\r\n          wishes for the success of the convention, cordially yours,\r\n\r\n                                             ELIZABETH CADY STANTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      LONDON, January 10, 1883.\r\n\r\n          DEAR MISS ANTHONY: I was very glad indeed to receive notice\r\n          of your mid-winter conference in time to send you a few\r\n          words about the progress of our work in England. I believe\r\n          our disappointment at the result of the vote in Nebraska\r\n          must have been greater than yours, as, being on the spot,\r\n          you saw the difficulties to be surmounted. I had so hoped\r\n          that the men of a free new State would prove themselves\r\n          juster and wiser than the men of our older civilizations,\r\n          whose prejudice and precedents are such formidable barriers.\r\n          But we cannot, judging from a distance, look upon the work\r\n          of the campaign as thrown away. Twenty-five thousand votes\r\n          in favor of woman suffrage in the face of such enormous odds\r\n          is really a victory, and the legislatures of these States\r\n          are deeply pledged to ratify the constitutional amendment,\r\n          if passed by congress. We look forward hopefully to the\r\n          discussion in congress. The majority report of the Senate\r\n          cannot fail to secure attention, and I hope your present\r\n          convention will bring together national forces that will\r\n          greatly influence the debate.\r\n\r\n                                             CAROLINE A. BIGGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         51 RUE DE VARENNE, PARIS, January 15, 1883.\r\n\r\n          MY DEAR MISS ANTHONY: Perhaps a brief account of what has\r\n          been done with the two packages of \"The History of Woman\r\n          Suffrage\" which you sent me for distribution in Europe may\r\n          prove interesting to the convention. In the first place,\r\n          sets in sheep have been deposited already, or will have been\r\n          before spring, in all the great continental libraries from\r\n          Russia to France, and from Denmark to Turkey. In the second\r\n          place, copies in cloth have been presented to reformers,\r\n          publicists, editors, etc, in every country of the old\r\n          world. This generous distribution of a costly work has\r\n          already begun to produce an effect. Besides a large number\r\n          of private letters from all parts of Europe acknowledging\r\n          the receipt of the volumes and bestowing on their contents\r\n          the highest praise, the History has been reviewed in\r\n          numerous reform, educational and socialistic periodicals and\r\n          newspapers in almost every modern European tongue. Nor is\r\n          this all. Every week a new pamphlet or book is sent me, or\r\n          comes under my notice, in which this History is cited,\r\n          sometimes at great length, and is pronounced to be the\r\n          authority on the American women's movement. I have carefully\r\n          kept all these letters, newspaper notices, etc., and at the\r\n          proper time I hope to prepare a little pamphlet for your\r\n          publisher on European opinion concerning your great work.\r\n\r\n                         Very truly yours,           THEODORE STANTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         51 RUE DE VARENNE, PARIS, January 15, 1883.\r\n\r\n          DEAR MISS ANTHONY: My husband has just read me a letter he\r\n          has written you concerning the enthusiastic reception your\r\n          big History has had among liberal people on this side of the\r\n          Atlantic, but he did not inform you that he should send the\r\n          American public next spring a similar though much smaller\r\n          work, entitled \"The Woman Question in Europe.\" The Putnams\r\n          of New York are now busy on the volume. You in the new world\r\n          have little idea how the leaders of the women's movement\r\n          here watch everything you do in the United States. The great\r\n          fact which my husband's volume will teach you in America is\r\n          the important and direct influence your movement is having\r\n          on the younger, less developed, but growing revolution in\r\n          favor of our sex, now in progress in every country of the\r\n          old world. While assisting in the preparation of the\r\n          manuscript for this book this fact has been thrust upon my\r\n          notice at every instant, and never before did I fully\r\n          realize the grand role the United States is acting in this\r\n          nineteenth century, for, rest assured, the moment European\r\n          women are emancipated monarchy gives way to the republic\r\n          everywhere.\r\n\r\n               Most sincerely yours,        MARGUERITTE BERRY STANTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    134 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, S. E., January 25, 1883.\r\n\r\n          DEAR SUSAN ANTHONY: I believe that this is the only week of\r\n          the whole winter when I could not come to you nor attend\r\n          your convention, much as I wish to do so. It has been an\r\n          exceptional week to me in the way of work and engagements,\r\n          full of both as I always am. I could not call on you last\r\n          Monday, as I was in my own crowded parlors from 1 till 10\r\n          o'clock at night. I tell you this that you may know that I\r\n          did not of my own accord stay away from you. I have not had\r\n          a moment to write you a coherent letter, such as I would be\r\n          willing you should read. But I _have_ saved the best reports\r\n          of the convention, and it shall have a good notice in the\r\n          _Independent_ of week after next. It shall have only praise.\r\n          Of course I could write a brighter, more characteristic\r\n          notice could I myself have attended. Should you stay over\r\n          next Sunday I can see you yet; but if not, remember I think\r\n          of you always with the warmest interest, and meet you always\r\n          with unchanged affection.\r\n\r\n                         Ever your friend,          MARY CLEMMER.\r\n\r\n          May God bless and keep you, I ever pray.[101]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, THURSDAY, March 1, 1883.\r\n\r\n     Mr. WHITE, by unanimous consent, from the Special Committee on\r\n     Woman Suffrage, reported back the joint resolution (H. Res., 255)\r\n     proposing an amendment to the constitution, which was referred to\r\n     the House calendar, and, with the accompanying report, ordered to\r\n     be printed.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SPRINGER: As a member of that committee I have not seen the\r\n     report, and do not know whether it meets with my\r\n     concurrence.[102]\r\n\r\n     Mr. WHITE: I ask by unanimous consent that the minority may have\r\n     leave to submit their views, to be printed with the majority\r\n     report.\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: The Chair hears no objection.\r\n\r\n     MR. WHITE, from the Select Committee on Woman Suffrage, submitted\r\n     the following:\r\n\r\n          _The Select Committee on Woman Suffrage, to whom was\r\n          referred House Resolution No. 255, proposing an amendment to\r\n          the Constitution of the United States to secure the right of\r\n          suffrage to citizens of the United States without regard to\r\n          sex, having considered the same, respectfully report:_\r\n\r\n          In attempting to comprehend the vast results that could and\r\n          would be attained by the adoption of the proposed article to\r\n          the constitution, a few considerations are presented that\r\n          are claimed by the friends of woman suffrage to be worthy of\r\n          the most serious attention, among which are the following:\r\n\r\n          I. There are vast interests in property vested in women,\r\n          which property is affected by taxation and legislation,\r\n          without the owners having voice or representation in regard\r\n          to it. The adoption of the proposed amendment would remove a\r\n          manifest injustice.\r\n\r\n          II. Consider the unjust discriminations made against women\r\n          in industrial and educational pursuits, and against those\r\n          who are compelled to earn a livelihood by work of hand or\r\n          brain. By conferring upon such the right of suffrage, their\r\n          condition, it is claimed, would be greatly improved by the\r\n          enlargement of their influence.\r\n\r\n          III. The questions of social and family relations are of\r\n          equal importance to and affect as many women as men. Giving\r\n          to women a voice in the enactment of laws pertaining to\r\n          divorce and the custody of children and division of property\r\n          would be merely recognizing an undeniable right.\r\n\r\n          IV. Municipal regulations in regard to houses of\r\n          prostitution, of gambling, of retail liquor traffic, and of\r\n          all other abominations of modern society, might be shaped\r\n          very differently and more perfectly were women allowed the\r\n          ballot.\r\n\r\n          V. If women had a voice in legislation, the momentous\r\n          question of peace and war, which may act with such fearful\r\n          intensity upon women, might be settled with less bloodshed.\r\n\r\n          VI. Finally, there is no condition, status in life, of rich\r\n          or poor; no question, moral or political; no interest,\r\n          present or future; no ties, foreign or domestic; no issues,\r\n          local or national; no phase of human life, in which the\r\n          mother is not equally interested with the father, the\r\n          daughter with the son, the sister with the brother.\r\n          Therefore the one should have equal voice with the other in\r\n          molding the destiny of this nation.\r\n\r\n          Believing these considerations to be so important as to\r\n          challenge the attention of all patriotic citizens, and that\r\n          the people have a right to be heard in the only\r\n          authoritative manner recognized by the constitution, we\r\n          report the accompanying resolution with a favorable\r\n          recommendation in order that the people, through the\r\n          legislatures of their respective States, may express their\r\n          views:\r\n\r\n          JOINT RESOLUTION _proposing an amendment to the Constitution\r\n          of the United States_:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_ by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\n          United States of America in congress assembled, (two-thirds\r\n          of each House concurring therein), That the following\r\n          article be proposed to the legislatures of the several\r\n          States as an amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\n          States, which, when ratified by three-fourths of the said\r\n          legislatures, shall be valid as part of said constitution,\r\n          namely:\r\n\r\n          SECTION 1. The right of citizens of the United States to\r\n          vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or\r\n          by any State on account of sex.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 2. The congress shall have power, by appropriate\r\n          legislation, to enforce the provisions of this article.\r\n\r\nThus closed the forty-seventh congress, and although with so little\r\npromise of any substantial good for women, yet this slight\r\nrecognition in legislation was encouraging to those who had so long\r\nappealed in vain for the attention of their representatives. A\r\ncommittee to even consider the wrongs of woman was more than had\r\never been secured before, and one to propose some measures of\r\njustice, sustained by the votes of a few statesmen awake to the\r\ndegradation of disfranchisement, gave some faint hope of more\r\ngenerous action in the near future. The tone of the debates[103] in\r\nthese later years even, on the nature and rights of women, is\r\nwholly unworthy the present type of developed womanhood and the age\r\nin which we live.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[81] During the autumn Miss Anthony, Mrs. Jones, Miss Snow and Miss\r\nCouzins, spending some weeks in Washington, asked for an audience\r\nwith President Chester A.

Many pleasant ladies from the Society of Friends were there\r\nalso and contributed to the dignity and interest of the occasion.\r\n\r\n[90] The speakers in the American convention were Lucy Stone, Henry\r\nB. Blackwell, Margaret W. Campbell, Mary E. Haggart, Judge Kingman\r\nand Governor Hoyt of Wyoming, Hannah Tracy Cutler, Mary B. Clay,\r\nDr. Mary F. Thomas, Rebecca N. Hazzard, Ada M.

Many of those from both\r\nassociations took part in the canvass. Miss Rachel G. Foster went\r\nout in the spring and made all the arrangements for the work of the\r\nNational. She studied the geography of the State, and the\r\nrailroads, and mapped out all the meetings for its twelve speakers.\r\n\r\n[91] For full reports of the American convention see the _Woman's\r\nJournal_, edited by Lucy Stone and published in Boston.\r\n\r\n[92] For reports of the National see _Our Herald_, edited by Helen\r\nM. Gougar and published in Lafayette, Ind. The daily papers of\r\nOmaha had full reports, the most fair by the _Republican_, edited\r\nby Mr. Brooks.\r\n\r\n[93] Their many courtesies are well summed up by Miss Foster in a\r\nletter to _Our Herald_:--DEAR HERALD: As your readers will know\r\nfrom the report of the executive meetings, it was decided to have a\r\nheadquarters for National Woman Suffrage Association speakers at\r\nOmaha. When your editor left, the arrangements had not been\r\ncompleted for office-room and furnishings. It is finally decided\r\nthat I, as secretary of the National Woman's Suffrage Association,\r\nremain in charge of this Omaha office, with Mrs. C. B. Colby as my\r\nassociate, while Mrs. Bittenbender has charge of the headquarters\r\nat Lincoln, and manages the American and State speakers, these two\r\nofficers of the campaign committee being in constant consultation.\r\n\r\nI cannot too strongly express the gratitude which our committee,\r\nand especially our National Woman's Suffrage Association, owes to\r\nthe kind firm of Kitchen Brothers, proprietors of the Paxton Hotel.\r\nDuring our late convention their attention has been unremitting,\r\nand they now crown it by giving us, rent free, a large,\r\nwell-lighted office to be occupied until election as the Omaha\r\nheadquarters of our campaign committee. I was somewhat puzzled\r\nabout the suitable furnishings for the room, but Mr. Kitchen told\r\nme he would attend to that himself, and through his kindness it\r\nwill be made very comfortable for us to occupy for the next five\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Dewey and Stone of this city, large dealers in furniture,\r\nhave given the use of a handsome and convenient desk which will\r\nenable us to bring order out of chaos. So you can imagine us,\r\nsurrounded by all convenient appliances, hard at work in our new\r\nquarters a good part of every day for this last month before\r\nelection. We can certainly not complain that we are not made\r\nwelcome to the best the city affords by these kind citizens of\r\nOmaha. Why, we even had a special engine and car given us by the\r\naccommodating manager of the Burlington & Missouri railroad to run\r\none of our speakers from Omaha to Lincoln to enable her to attend a\r\nmeeting which would otherwise have lacked a speaker. Mr.\r\nMontmorency, on behalf of the Burlington & Missouri railroad,\r\nextended this courtesy (and in our need at that hour it was highly\r\nappreciated) to us because of the work in which we are engaged. As\r\nall know ere this, both this road and the Union Pacific have given\r\nto our speakers and delegates generous reductions over all their\r\nlines in this State.\r\n\r\nMayor Boyd, owner of the Opera House, has also done his share to\r\naid us toward success, in his great reduction of ordinary rates to\r\nus while we occupy his handsome building with our suffrage mass\r\nmeetings. We have the Opera House now secured for October 4, 13,\r\n19, 26, November 2 and 6, on which dates large meetings will be\r\naddressed by some of our principal speakers. The first date is to\r\nbe filled by Miss Phoebe Couzins, on \"The Woman Without a Country.\"\r\n\r\nThe full report of our proceedings at the Omaha and Lincoln\r\nconventions, with the newspaper comments upon the size and\r\ncharacter of the audiences there assembled, as well as the\r\ncourtesies which I have just mentioned, will convince our readers\r\nthat we are seemingly welcome guests here in Nebraska, and I may\r\nsay especially in Omaha. I will keep the _Herald_ posted from week\r\nto week upon campaign committee work.\r\n\r\n                         Yours for success,      RACHEL G. FOSTER.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters of Suffrage Campaign Committee, Paxton House, Omaha,\r\nOctober 2, 1882.\r\n\r\n[94] A private letter was received from Mrs. Ellen Clark Sargent,\r\nenclosing a check for $50.\r\n\r\n[95] Miss Stanton, having studied astronomy with Professor Maria\r\nMitchell, went to Europe to take a degree in Mathematics from the\r\nCollege of France; but before completing her course, she shared the\r\nfate of too many of our American girls; she expatriated herself by\r\nmarrying a foreigner.\r\n\r\n[96] Letters were also received from Rebecca Moore, England; Mrs.\r\nZ. G. Wallace, Indianapolis; Frederick Douglass, Washington, D. C.;\r\nTheodore Stanton, Paris, France; Sarah Knox Goodrich, Clarina\r\nHoward Nichols, California, and many others.\r\n\r\n[97] WHEREAS, The National Woman Suffrage Association has labored\r\nunremittingly to secure the appointment of a committee in the\r\ncongress of the United States to receive and consider the petitions\r\nof women and whereas, this Association realizes the importance of\r\nsuch a committee,\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the thanks of this Association are due and are\r\nhereby tendered to congress for the appointment at its last session\r\nof a Select Woman Suffrage Committee in each house.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the thanks of this Association are hereby tendered\r\nto Senators Lapham, Ferry, Blair and Anthony, of the Select\r\nCommittee, for their able majority report.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That it is the paramount duty of congress at its next\r\nsession to submit a sixteenth amendment to the constitution which\r\nshall secure the enfranchisement of the women of the republic.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the recent action of King Christian of Denmark, in\r\nconferring the right of municipal suffrage upon the women in\r\nIceland, and the similar enlargement of woman's political freedom\r\nin Scotland, India and Russia, are all encouraging evidences of the\r\nprogress of self-government even in monarchical countries. And\r\nfarther, that while the possession of these privileges by our\r\nforeign sisters is an occasion of rejoicing to us, it still but\r\nemphasizes the inconsistency of a republic which refuses political\r\nrecognition to one-half of its citizens.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the especial thanks of the officers and delegates\r\nof this convention are due and are hereby most cordially tendered\r\nto Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby, for the exceptionally efficient manner\r\nin which she has discharged the onerous duties which devolved upon\r\nher in making all preparations for this convention and for the\r\ngrand success which her efforts have secured.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the National Woman Suffrage Association on the\r\noccasion of this, its fourteenth annual convention, does, in the\r\nabsence of its honored president, desire to send greeting to\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton, and to express to her the sympathetic\r\nadmiration with which the members of this body have followed her in\r\nher reception in a foreign land.\r\n\r\n[98] Committee on Resolutions, composed of Lillie Devereux Blake of\r\nNew York city, Virginia L. Minor of St. Louis, Harriet R. Shattuck\r\nof Boston, May Wright Sewall of Indianapolis, and Ellen H. Sheldon\r\nof the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n[99] Mrs. Spofford, the treasurer, reported that $5,000 were spent\r\nin Nebraska in the endeavor to carry the amendment in that State.\r\n\r\n[100] Short speeches were made by Mrs. Rogers, Mrs. Lockwood, Mrs.\r\nMcKinney, Mrs. Loder and others.\r\n\r\n[101] This was the last word from this dear friend to one of our\r\nnumber. I met her afterward as Mrs. Hudson with her husband in\r\nLondon. We dined together one evening at the pleasant home of\r\nMoncure D. Conway. She was as full as ever of plans for future\r\nusefulness and enjoyment. From England she went for a short trip on\r\nthe continent. In parting I little thought she would so soon finish\r\nher work on earth. E. C. S.\r\n\r\n[102] Mr. Springer had never been present at a single meeting of\r\nthe committee, though always officially notified. Neither did Mr.\r\nMuldrow of Mississippi ever honor the committee with his presence.\r\nHowever, Mr. Stockslager of Indiana and Mr. Vance of North Carolina\r\nwere always in their places, and the latter, we thought, almost\r\npersuaded to consider with favor the claims of women to political\r\nequality.\r\n\r\n[103] Reports of congressional action and the conventions of\r\n1884-85 have been already published in pamphlet form, and we shall\r\nprint the reports hereafter once in two years, corresponding with\r\nthe terms of congress. Our plan is to bind these together once in\r\nsix years, making volumes of the size of those already published.\r\nThese pamphlets, as well as the complete History in three volumes,\r\nare for sale at the publishing house of Charles Mann, 8 Elm Park,\r\nRochester, N.

If anything can make the women of the State regret\r\nthat they were silent as to their own claims for six eventful years\r\nthat the freedom of the black man might be secured, it is the\r\nfact that now in 1885 his vote is ever adverse to women's\r\nenfranchisement. When the fourteenth amendment to the United States\r\nConstitution was proposed, in which the negro's liberty and his\r\nright to the ballot were to be established, an effort was made to\r\nsecure in it some recognition of the rights of woman. Massachusetts\r\nsent a petition, headed with the name of Lydia Maria Child, against\r\nthe introduction of the word \"male\" in the proposed amendment. When\r\nthis petition was offered to the greatest of America's emancipation\r\nleaders, for presentation to congress, he received and presented it\r\nunder protest. He thought the woman question should not be\r\nforced at such a time, and the only answer from congress this\r\n\"woman-intruding\" petition received was found in the fourteenth\r\namendment itself, in which the word \"male,\" with unnecessary\r\niteration, was repeated, so that there might be no mistake in\r\nfuture concerning woman's rights, under the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States.[105]\r\n\r\nThe war was over. The rights of the black man, for whom the women\r\nhad worked and waited, were secured, but under the new amendment,\r\nby which his race had been made free, the white women of the United\r\nStates were more securely held in political slavery. It was time,\r\nindeed, to hold conventions and agitate anew the question of\r\nwoman's rights. The lesson of the war had been well learned. Women\r\nhad been taught to understand politics, the \"science of\r\ngovernment,\" and to take an interest in public events; and some who\r\nbefore the war had not thought upon the matter, began to ask\r\nthemselves why thousands of ignorant _men_ should be made voters\r\nand they, or their sex, still kept in bondage under the law.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, May 31, the first meeting of the American Equal Rights\r\nAssociation was held at the Meionaon in Boston.[106] In 1868 the\r\ncall for a New England convention was issued and the meeting was\r\nheld November 18, 19, at Horticultural Hall, Boston. James Freeman\r\nClarke presided. In this convention sat many of the distinguished\r\nmen and women of the New England States,[107] old-time advocates,\r\ntogether with newer converts to the doctrine, who then became\r\nidentified with the cause of equal rights irrespective of sex. This\r\nconvention was called by the Rev. Olympia Brown.[108] The hall was\r\ncrowded with eager listeners anxious to hear what would be said on\r\na subject thought to be ridiculous by a large majority of people in\r\nthe community. Some of the teachers of Boston sent a letter to the\r\nconvention, signed with their names, expressing their interest as\r\nwomen. Henry Wilson avowed his belief in the equal rights of woman,\r\nbut thought the time had not yet come for such a consummation, and\r\nsaid that, for this reason, he had voted against the question in\r\nthe United States Senate; \"though,\" he continued, \"I was afterwards\r\nashamed of having so voted.\" Like another celebrated Massachusetts\r\npolitician, he believed in the principle of the thing, but was\r\n\"agin its enforcement.\" At this date the popular interest\r\nheretofore given to the anti-slavery question was transferred to\r\nthe woman suffrage movement.\r\n\r\nThe New England Woman Suffrage Association was formed at this\r\nconvention. Julia Ward Howe was elected its president, and made her\r\nfirst address on the subject of woman's equality with man. On its\r\nexecutive board were many representative names from the six New\r\nEngland States.[109] By the formation of this society, a great\r\nimpetus was given to the suffrage cause in New England. It held\r\nconventions and mass-meetings, printed tracts and documents, and\r\nput lecturers in the field. It set in motion two woman suffrage\r\nbazars, and organized subscription festivals, and other enterprises\r\nto raise money to carry on the work. It projected the American, and\r\nMassachusetts suffrage associations; it urged the formation of\r\nlocal and county suffrage societies, and set up the _Woman's\r\nJournal_. The New England Association held its first anniversary in\r\nMay, 1869, and the meeting was even more successful than the\r\nopening one of the preceding year. On this occasion Mrs. Livermore\r\nspoke in Boston for the first time, and many new friends coming\r\nforward gave vigor and freshness to the movement.[110] Wendell\r\nPhilips, Lucy Stone and Gilbert Haven, spoke at this convention. It\r\nwas on this occasion that the \"good Bishop,\" as he afterward came\r\nto be called, was met on leaving the meeting by one who did not\r\nknow his opinion on the subject. This person expressed surprise on\r\nseeing him at a woman's rights meeting, and said: \"_What! you_\r\nhere?\" \"Yes,\" said he, \"I _am_ here! I _believe_ in this reform. I\r\nam going to start in the beginning, and ride with the procession.\"\r\nAfter this, not until his earthly journey was finished, was his\r\nplace in \"the procession\" found vacant. Since 1869 the New England\r\nAssociation has held its annual meeting in Boston during\r\nanniversary week, in May, when reports from various States are\r\noffered, concerning suffrage work done during the year. The\r\nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association was organized in 1869. Since\r\nits formation it has held its annual conventions in some of the\r\nchief cities of the several States.[111] A meeting was held in\r\nHorticultural Hall, Boston, January 28, 1870, to organize the\r\nMassachusetts Woman Suffrage Association.[112]\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Association is the most active of the three\r\nsocieties named. Its work is generally local though it has sent\r\nhelp to Colorado, Michigan, and other Western States. It has kept\r\npetitions in circulation, and has presented petitions and memorials\r\nto the State legislatures. It has asked for hearings and secured\r\nable speakers for them. It has held conventions, mass-meetings,\r\nFourth of July celebrations. It has helped organize local Woman\r\nsuffrage clubs and societies, and has printed for circulation\r\nnumerous woman suffrage tracts. The amount of work done by its\r\nlecturing agents can be seen by the statement of Margaret W.\r\nCampbell, who alone, as agent of the American, the New England and\r\nthe Massachusetts associations, traveled in twenty different States\r\nand two territories, organizing and speaking in conventions.[113]\r\nAs part of the latest work of this society may be mentioned its\r\nefforts to present before the women of the State, in clear and\r\ncomprehensive form, an explanation of the different sections of the\r\nnew law \"allowing women to vote for school committees.\" As soon as\r\nthe law passed the legislature of 1879, a circular of instructions\r\nto women was carefully prepared by Samuel E. Sewall, an eminent\r\nlawyer and member of the board of the Massachusetts Association, in\r\nwhich all the points of law in relation to the new right were ably\r\npresented. Thousands of copies of this circular were sent to women\r\nall over the State.\r\n\r\nThe Centennial Tea Party was held in Boston, December 15, 1873, in\r\nresponse to the following call:\r\n\r\n     The women of New England who believe that \"taxation without\r\n     representation is tyranny,\" and that our forefathers were\r\n     justified in defying despotic power by throwing the tea into\r\n     Boston harbor, invite the men and women of New England to unite\r\n     with them in celebrating the one-hundredth anniversary of that\r\n     event in Fanueil Hall.[114]\r\n\r\nThree thousand people were in attendance, and it was altogether an\r\nenthusiastic occasion and one long to be remembered.\r\n\r\nThe record of conventions and meetings held by the Massachusetts\r\nAssociation by no means includes all such gatherings held in\r\ndifferent towns and cities of the State. The county and local\r\nsocieties have done a vast amount of work. The Hampden society was\r\nstarted in 1868, with Eliphalet Trask, Frank B. Sanborn and\r\nMargaret W. Campbell as leading officers. This was the first county\r\nsociety formed in the State. Julia Ward Howe, a fresh convert of\r\nthe recent convention went to Salem to lecture on woman suffrage,\r\nand the Essex county society was formed with Mrs. Sarah G. Wilkins\r\nand Mrs. Delight R. P. Hewitt--the only two Salem women who went to\r\nthe 1850 convention at Worcester--on its executive board. The\r\nMiddlesex county society followed, planned by Ada C. Bowles and\r\nofficered by names well known in that historic old county. The\r\nHampshire and Worcester societies brought up the rear; the former\r\nplanned by Seth Hunt of Northampton. Notable conventions were held\r\nby the Middlesex society in 1876--one in Malden, one in Melrose and\r\none in Concord, organized and conducted by its president, Harriet\r\nH. Robinson. This last celebrated town had never before been so\r\nfavored. These meetings were conducted something after the style of\r\nlocal church conferences. They were well advertised, and many\r\npeople came. A collation was provided by the ladies of each town,\r\nand the feast of reason was so judiciously mingled with the\r\ntriumphs of cookery, that converts to the cause were never so\r\neasily won. Many women present said to the president: \"I never\r\nbefore heard a woman's rights speech. If these are the reasons why\r\nwomen should vote, I believe in voting.\"\r\n\r\nThe Concord convention was held about a month after the great\r\ncentennial celebration of April 19, 1875--a celebration in which no\r\nwoman belonging to that town took any official part. Nor was there\r\nany place of honor found for the more distinguished women who had\r\ncome long distances to share in the festivities. Some of the women\r\nwere descendents of Governor John Hancock, Dr. Samuel Prescott,\r\nMajor John Buttrick, Rev. William Emerson and Lieutenant Emerson\r\nCogswell. Though no seat of honor in the big tent in which the\r\nspeeches were made was given to the women of to-day, silent\r\nmemorials of those who had taken part in the events of one hundred\r\nyears ago, had found a conspicuous place there--the scissors that\r\ncut the immortal cartridges made by the women on that eventful day,\r\nand the ancient flag that the fingers of some of the mothers of the\r\nRevolution had made. Though the Concord women were not permitted to\r\nshare the centennial honors, they were not deprived of the\r\nprivilege of paying their part of the expenses incident to the\r\noccasion. To meet these, an increased tax-rate was assessed upon\r\nall the property owners in the town; and, since one-fifth of the\r\ntown tax of Concord is paid by women, it will be seen what was\r\ntheir share in the great centennial celebration of 1876.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the proceedings at Concord added new zest to the\r\nspirit of the three conventions, and the events of the day were\r\nused by the speakers to point the moral of the woman's rights\r\nquestion. Lucy Stone made one of her most effective and eloquent\r\nspeeches upon this subject. She said:\r\n\r\n     FELLOW CITIZENS (I had almost said fellow subjects): What we need\r\n     is that women should feel their mean position; when that happens,\r\n     they will soon make an effort to get out of it. Everything is\r\n     possible to him that wills. All that is needed for the success of\r\n     the cause of woman suffrage is to have women know that they want\r\n     to vote. Concord and Lexington got into a fight about the\r\n     centennial, and Concord voted $10,000 for the celebration in\r\n     order to eclipse Lexington. One-fifth of the tax of Concord is\r\n     paid by the women, yet not one of these women dared to go to the\r\n     town hall and cast her vote upon that subject. This is exactly\r\n     the same thing which took place one hundred years ago--taxation\r\n     without representation, against which the _men_ of Concord then\r\n     rebelled. If I were an inhabitant of Concord, I would let my\r\n     house be sold over my head and my clothes off my back and be\r\n     hanged by the neck before I would pay a cent of it! Men of\r\n     Melrose, Concord and Malden, why persecute us? Would you like to\r\n     be a slave? Would you like to be disfranchised? Would you like to\r\n     be bound to respect the laws which you cannot make? There are\r\n     15,000,000 of women whom the government denies legal rights.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that a spot upon which the battle for freedom\r\nand independence was first begun would always be the vantage ground\r\nof questions relating to personal liberty. But such is not the\r\nfact. Concord was never an anti-slavery town, though some of its\r\nbest citizens took active part in all the abolition movements. When\r\nthe time came that women were allowed to vote for school\r\ncommittees, the same intolerant spirit which ignored and shut them\r\nout of the centennial celebration was again manifested toward\r\nthem--not only by the leading magnates, but also by the petty\r\nofficials of the town. Some of them have from the first shown a\r\ngreat deal of ingenuity in inventing ways to intimidate and mislead\r\nthe women voters.\r\n\r\nAt the annual convention of the Massachusetts Association, in May,\r\n1880, the following resolution was passed:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, We believe in keeping the land-marks and traditions of\r\n     our movement; and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, It will be thirty years next October since the first\r\n     woman's rights meeting was held in the State, and it seems\r\n     fitting that there should be some celebration of the event;\r\n     therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we will hold a woman suffrage jubilee in\r\n     Worcester, October 23 and 24 next, to commemorate the anniversary\r\n     of our first convention.\r\n\r\nA committee[115] of arrangements was chosen, and the meeting was\r\nheld. There were present many whose silver hairs told of long and\r\nfaithful service. The oldest ladies there were Mrs. Lydia Brown of\r\nLynn, Mrs. Wilbour of Worcester, and Julia E. Smith Parker of\r\nGlastonbury, Conn. On the afternoon of the first day there was an\r\ninformal gathering of friends in the ante-room of Horticultural\r\nHall. Old-time memories were recalled by those who had not seen\r\neach other for many years, and the common salutation was: \"How gray\r\nyou've grown!\" Many of them had indeed grown gray in the service,\r\nand their faces were changed, but made beautiful by a life devoted\r\nto a noble purpose. There were many present who had attended the\r\nconvention of thirty years ago--Abby Kelley Foster, Lucy Stone,\r\nAntoinette Brown Blackwell, Paulina Gerry, Rev. Samuel May, Rev. W.\r\nH. Channing, Joseph A. Howland, Adeline H. Howland, Dr. Martha H.\r\nMowry and many, many others. It was very pleasant indeed to hear\r\nthese veterans whose clear voices have spoken out so long and so\r\nbravely for the cause. The speaking[116] at all the sessions was\r\nexcellent, and the spirit of the convention was very reverent and\r\nhopeful.\r\n\r\nThe tone of the press concerning woman's rights meetings had\r\nchanged greatly since thirty years before. \"Hen conventions\" had\r\ngone by, and a woman's meeting was now called by its proper name.\r\nRepresentatives of leading newspapers from all parts of the State\r\nwere present, and the reports were written in a just and friendly\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Harriet H. Robinson]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts School Suffrage Association was formed in 1880,\r\nAbby W. May, president.[117] Its efforts are mostly confined to\r\nBoston. An independent movement of women voters in Boston, distinct\r\nfrom all organizations, was formed in 1884, and subdivided into\r\nward and city committees. These did much valuable work and secured\r\na larger number of voters than had qualified in previous years. In\r\n1880 the number of registered women in the whole State was 4,566,\r\nand in Boston 826. In 1884, chiefly owing to the ward and city\r\ncommittees, the number in Boston alone was 1,100. This year (1885)\r\na movement among the Roman Catholic women has raised the number who\r\nare assessed to vote to 1,843; and it is estimated that when the\r\ntax-paying women are added, the whole number will be about 2,500.\r\n\r\nThe National Woman Suffrage Association[118] of Massachusetts was\r\nformed in January, 1882, of members who had joined the National\r\nAssociation at its thirteenth annual meeting, held in Tremont\r\nTemple, Boston, May 26, 27, 1881. According to Article II. of its\r\nconstitution, its object is to secure to women their right to the\r\nballot, by working for national, State, municipal, school, or any\r\nother form of suffrage which shall at the time seem most expedient.\r\nWhile it is auxiliary to the National Association, it reserves\r\nto itself the right of independent action. It has held\r\nconventions[119] in Boston and some of the chief cities of the\r\nState, sent delegates to the annual Washington Convention[120] and\r\npublished valuable leaflets.[121] It has rolled up petitions to the\r\nState legislature and to congress. Its most valuable work has been\r\nthe canvass made in certain localities in the city and country in\r\n1884, to ascertain the number of women in favor of suffrage, the\r\nnumber opposed and the number indifferent. The total result showed\r\nthat there were 405 in favor, 44 opposed, 166 indifferent, 160\r\nrefusing to sign, 39 not seen; that is, over nine who would sign\r\nthemselves in favor to one who would sign herself opposed. This\r\ncanvass was made by women who gave their time and labor to this\r\narduous work, and the results were duly presented to the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 this Association petitioned the legislature to pass a\r\nresolution recommending congress to submit a proposition for a\r\nsixteenth amendment to the national constitution. The Senate\r\nCommittee on Woman Suffrage granted a hearing March 23, and soon\r\nafter presented a favorable report; but the resolution, when\r\nbrought to a vote, was lost by 21 to 11. This was the first time\r\nthat the National doctrine of congressional action was ever\r\npresented or voted upon in the Massachusetts legislature. A second\r\nhearing[122] was granted on February 28, 1884, before the Committee\r\non Federal Relations. They reported leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\nThe associations mentioned are not the only ones that are aiding\r\nthe suffrage movement. Its friends are found in all the women's\r\nclubs, temperance associations, missionary movements, charitable\r\nenterprises, educational and industrial unions and church\r\ncommittees. These agencies form a network of motive power which is\r\ngradually carrying the reform into all branches of public work.\r\n\r\nThe _Woman's Journal_ was incorporated in 1870 and is owned by a\r\njoint stock company, shares being held by leading members of the\r\nsuffrage associations of New England. Shortly after it was\r\nprojected, the _Agitator_, then published in Chicago by Mary A.\r\nLivermore, was bought by the New England Association on condition\r\nthat she should \"come to Boston for one year, at a reasonable\r\ncompensation, to assist the cause by her editorial labor and\r\nspeaking at conventions.\" Lucy Stone and Henry B. Blackwell,\r\ninvited by the same society to \"return to the work in\r\nMassachusetts,\" at once assumed the editorial charge. T. W.\r\nHigginson, Julia Ward Howe and W. L. Garrison were assistant\r\neditors. \"Warrington,\" Kate N. Doggett, Samuel E. Sewall, F. B.\r\nSanborn, and many other good writers, lent a helping hand to the\r\nnew enterprise. The _Woman's Journal_ has been of great value to\r\nthe cause. It has helped individual women and brought their\r\nenterprises into public notice. It has opened its columns to\r\ninexperienced writers and advertised young speakers. To sustain the\r\npaper and furnish money for other work, two mammoth bazars or fairs\r\nwere held in Music Hall in 1870, 1871. Nearly all the New England\r\nStates and many of the towns in Massachusetts were represented by\r\ntables in these bazars. Donations were sent from all directions and\r\nthe women worked, as they generally do in a cause in which they are\r\ninterested, to raise money to furnish the sinews of war. The\r\nnewspapers from day to day were full of descriptions of the\r\nsplendors of the tables, and the reporters spoke well of the women\r\nwho had taken this novel method to carry on their movement. People\r\nwho had never heard of woman suffrage before came to see what sort\r\nof women were those who thus made a public exhibition of their zeal\r\nin this cause. In remote places, as well as nearer the scene of\r\naction, many people who had never thought of the significance of\r\nthe woman's rights movement, began to consider it through reading\r\nthe reports of the woman suffrage bazar.\r\n\r\nFemale opponents of the suffrage movement began to make a stir as\r\nearly as 1868. A remonstrance was sent into the legislature, from\r\ntwo hundred women of Lancaster, giving the reasons why women should\r\nnot enjoy the exercise of the elective franchise: \"It would\r\ndiminish the purity, the dignity and the moral influence of woman,\r\nand bring into the family circle a dangerous element of discord.\"\r\nIn _The Revolution_ of August 5, 1869, Parker Pillsbury said:\r\n\r\n     Dolly Chandler and the hundred and ninety-four other women who\r\n     asked the Massachusetts legislature not to allow the right of\r\n     suffrage, were very impudent and tyrannical, too, in petitioning\r\n     for any but themselves. They should have said: \"We, Dolly\r\n     Chandler and her associates, to the number of a hundred and\r\n     ninety-five in all, do not want the right of suffrage; and we\r\n     pray your honorable bodies to so decree and enact that we shall\r\n     never have it.\" So far they might go. But when they undertake to\r\n     prevent a hundred and ninety-four thousand other women who do\r\n     want the ballot and who have an acknowledged right to it, and are\r\n     laboring for it day and night, it is proper to ask, What business\r\n     have Dolly Chandler and her little coterie to interpose? Nobody\r\n     wants them to vote unless they themselves want to. They can stay\r\n     at home and see nobody but the assessor, the tax-gatherer and the\r\n     revenue collector, from Christmas to Christmas, if they so\r\n     prefer. Those gentlemen they will be pretty likely to see,\r\n     annually or quarterly, and to feel their power, too, if they have\r\n     pockets with anything in them, in spite of all petitions to the\r\n     legislature.\r\n\r\nIt did not occur to these women that by thus remonstrating they\r\nwere doing just what they were protesting against. What _is_ a\r\nvote? An expression of opinion or a desire as to governmental\r\naffairs, in the shape of a ballot. The \"aspiring blood of\r\nLancaster\" should have mounted higher than this, since, if it\r\nreally was the opinion of these remonstrants that woman cannot vote\r\nwithout becoming defiled, they should have kept themselves out of\r\nthe legislature, should have kept their hands from petitioning and\r\ntheir thoughts from agitation on either side of the subject. Just\r\nsuch illogical reasoning on the woman suffrage question is often\r\nbrought forward and passes for the profoundest wisdom and\r\ndiscreetest delicacy! The same arguments are used by the\r\nremonstrants of to-day, who are now fully organized and doing very\r\nefficient political work in opposing further political action by\r\nwomen. In their carriages, with footman and driver, they solicit\r\nnames to their remonstrances. As a Boston newspaper says:\r\n\r\n     The anti-woman suffrage women get deeper and deeper into politics\r\n     year by year in their determination to keep out of politics. By\r\n     the time they triumph they will be the most accomplished\r\n     politicians of the sex, and unable to stop writing to the papers,\r\n     holding meetings, circulating remonstrances, any more than the\r\n     suffrage sisterhood.\r\n\r\nThese persons, men and women, bring their whole force to bear\r\nbefore legislative committees at woman suffrage hearings, and use\r\narguments that might have been excusable forty years ago. However\r\nthis is merely a phase of the general movement and will work for\r\ngood in the end. It can no more stop the progress of the reform\r\nthan it can stop the revolution of the globe.\r\n\r\nPolitical agitation on the woman suffrage question began in\r\nMassachusetts in 1870. A convention to discuss the feasibility of\r\nforming a woman suffrage political party was held in Boston, at\r\nwhich Julia Ward Howe presided, and Rev. Augusta Chapin offered\r\nprayer. The question of a separate nomination for State officers\r\nwas carefully considered.[123] Delegates were present from the\r\nLabor Reform and Prohibition parties, and strong efforts were made\r\nby them to induce the convention to nominate Wendell Phillips, who\r\nhad already accepted the nomination of those two parties, as\r\ncandidate for governor. The convention at one time seemed strongly\r\nin favor of this action, the women in particular thinking that in\r\nMr. Phillips they would find a staunch and well tried leader. But\r\nmore politic counsels prevailed, and it was finally concluded to\r\npostpone a separate nomination until after the Republican and\r\nDemocratic conventions had been held. A State central committee was\r\nformed, and at once began active political agitation. A memorial\r\nwas prepared to present to each of the last-named conventions; and\r\nthe candidates on the State tickets of the four political parties\r\nwere questioned by letter concerning their opinions on the right of\r\nthe women to the ballot. At the Republican State convention held\r\nOctober 5, 1870, the question was fairly launched into politics, by\r\nthe admission, for the first time, of two women, Lucy Stone and\r\nMary A. Livermore, as regularly accredited delegates. Both were\r\ninvited to speak, and the following resolution drawn up by Henry B.\r\nBlackwell, was presented by Charles W. Slack:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the Republican party of Massachusetts is mindful\r\n     of its obligations to the loyal women of America for their\r\n     patriotic devotion to the cause of liberty; that we rejoice in\r\n     the action of the recent legislature in making women eligible as\r\n     officers of the State; that we thank Governor Claflin for having\r\n     appointed women to important political trusts; that we are\r\n     heartily in favor of the enfranchisement of women, and will hail\r\n     the day when the educated, intelligent and enlightened conscience\r\n     of the women of Massachusetts has direct expression at the ballot\r\n     box.\r\n\r\nThis resolution was presented to the committee, who did not agree\r\nas to the propriety of reporting it to the convention, and they\r\ninstructed their chairman, George F. Hoar, to state the fact and\r\nrefer the resolution back to that body for its own action. A warm\r\ndebate arose, in which several members of the convention made\r\nspeeches on both sides of the question. The resolution was finally\r\ndefeated, 137 voting in its favor, and 196 against it. Although\r\nlost, the large vote in the affirmative was thought to mean a great\r\ndeal as a guaranty of the good faith of the Republican party, and\r\nthe women were willing to trust to its promises. It was thought\r\nthen, as it has been thought since, that most of the friends of\r\nwoman suffrage were in the Republican party, and that the interests\r\nof the cause could best be furthered by depending on its action.\r\nThe women were, however, mistaken, and have learned to look upon\r\nthe famous resolution in its true light. It is now known as the\r\n_coup d'etat_ of the Worcester convention of 1870, which\r\nreally had more votes than it was fairly entitled to. After\r\nthat,--\"forewarned, forearmed,\" said the enemies of the enterprise,\r\nand woman suffrage resolutions have received less votes in\r\nRepublican conventions.\r\n\r\nWhen the memorial prepared by the State Central Committee was\r\npresented to the Democratic State convention, that body, in\r\nresponse, passed a resolution conceding the _principle_ of women's\r\nright to suffrage, but at the same time declared itself against its\r\nbeing _enforced_, or put into practice. To finish the brief record\r\nof the dealings of the Democratic party, with the women of the\r\nState, it may be said that since 1870, it has never responded to\r\ntheir appeals, nor taken any action of importance on the question.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 a resolution endorsing woman suffrage was passed in the\r\nRepublican convention. In June, 1872, the national convention at\r\nPhiladelphia, passed the following:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the Republican party is mindful of its\r\n     obligations to the loyal women of America for their noble\r\n     devotion to the cause of freedom; their admission to wider fields\r\n     of usefulness is viewed with satisfaction; and the honest demand\r\n     of any class of citizens for additional rights, should be treated\r\n     with respectful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Republican State Convention, following this lead,\r\nagain passed a woman suffrage resolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we heartily approve the recognition of the\r\n     rights of woman contained in the fourteenth clause of the\r\n     national Republican platform; that the Republican party of\r\n     Massachusetts, as the representative of liberty and progress, is\r\n     in favor of extending suffrage to all American citizens\r\n     irrespective of sex, and will hail the day when the educated\r\n     intellect and enlightened conscience of woman shall find direct\r\n     expression at the ballot-box.\r\n\r\nThis was during the campaign of 1872, when General Grant's chance\r\nof reelection was thought to be somewhat uncertain, and the\r\nRepublican women in all parts of the country were called on to\r\nrally to his support. The National Woman Suffrage Association had\r\nissued \"an appeal to the women of America,\" asking them to\r\ncooeperate with the Republican party and work for the election of\r\nits candidates. In response to this appeal a ratification meeting\r\nwas held at Tremont Temple, in Boston, at which hundreds stayed to\r\na late hour listening to speeches made by women on the political\r\nquestions of the day. An address was issued from the \"Republican\r\nwomen of Massachusetts to the women of America.\" In this address\r\nthey announced their faith in and willingness to \"trust the\r\nRepublican party and its candidates, as saying what they mean and\r\nmeaning what they say, and in view of their honorable record we\r\nhave no fear of betrayal on their part.\" Mrs. Livermore, Lucy Stone\r\nand Huldah B. Loud took part in the canvass, and agents employed by\r\nthe Massachusetts Association were instructed to speak for the\r\nRepublican party.[124] Women writers furnished articles for the\r\nnewspapers and the Republican women did as much effective work\r\nduring the campaign as if each one had been a \"man and a voter.\"\r\nThey did everything but vote. All this agitation was a benefit to\r\nthe Republican party, but not to woman suffrage, because for a time\r\nit arrayed other political parties against the movement and caused\r\nit to be thought merely a party issue, while it is too broad a\r\nquestion for such limitation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was reelected and the campaign was over. When the\r\nlegislature met and the suffrage question came up for discussion,\r\nthat body, composed in large majority of Republicans, showed the\r\nwomen of Massachusetts the difference between \"saying what you mean\r\nand meaning what you say,\" the Woman Suffrage bill being defeated\r\nby a large majority. The women learned by this experience that\r\nnothing is to be expected of a political party while it is in\r\npower. To close the subject of suffrage resolutions in the platform\r\nof the Republican party, it may be said that they continued to be\r\nput in and seemed to mean something until after 1875, when they\r\nbecame only \"glittering generalities,\" and were as devoid of real\r\nmeaning or intention as any that were ever passed by the old Whig\r\nparty on the subject of abolition. Yet from 1870 to 1874 the\r\nRepublican party had the power to fulfill its promises on this\r\nquestion. Since then, it has been too busy trying to keep breath in\r\nits own body to lend a helping hand to any struggling reform. At\r\nthe Republican convention, held in Worcester in 1880, an attempt\r\nwas made by Mr. Blackwell to introduce a resolution endorsing the\r\nright conferred upon women in the law allowing them to vote for\r\nschool committees, passed by the legislature of 1879. This\r\nresolution was rejected by the committee, and when offered in\r\nconvention as an amendment, it was voted down without a single\r\nvoice, except that of the mover, being raised in its support. Yet\r\nthis resolution only asked a Republican convention to endorse an\r\nexisting right, conferred on the women of the State by a Republican\r\nlegislature! A political party as a party of freedom must be very\r\nfar spent when it refuses at its annual convention to endorse an\r\nact passed by a legislature the majority of whose members are\r\nrepresentatives elected from its own body. Since that time the\r\nRepublican party has entirely ignored the claims of woman. In 1884,\r\nat its annual convention, an effort was made, as usual, by Mr.\r\nBlackwell, to introduce a resolution, but without success, and yet\r\nsome of the best of our leaders advised the women to \"stand by the\r\nRepublican party.\"[125]\r\n\r\nThe question of forming a woman suffrage political party had, since\r\n1870, been often discussed.[126] In 1875 Thomas J. Lothrop proposed\r\nthe formation of a separate organization. But it was not until 1876\r\nthat any real effort in this direction was made. The Prohibitory\r\n(or Temperance) party sometimes holds the balance of political\r\npower in Massachusetts, and many of the members of that party are\r\nalso strong advocates of suffrage. The feeling had been growing\r\nfor several years that if forces could be joined with the\r\nProhibitionists some practical result in politics might be reached,\r\nand though there was a difference of opinion on this subject, many\r\nwere willing to see the experiment tried.\r\n\r\nThe Prohibitory party had at its convention in 1876 passed a\r\nresolution inviting the women to take part in its primary meetings,\r\nwith an equal voice and vote in the nomination of candidates and\r\ntransaction of business. After long and anxious discussions, the\r\nMassachusetts Woman Suffrage State Central Committee, in whose\r\nhands all political action rested, determined to accept this\r\ninvitation. A woman suffrage political convention was held, at\r\nwhich the Prohibitory candidates were endorsed and a joint State\r\nticket was decided on, to be headed \"Prohibition and Equal Rights.\"\r\nThese tickets were sent to women all over the State, and they were\r\nstrongly urged to go to the polls and distribute them on election\r\nday. Lucy Stone, Mary A. Livermore and other leading speakers took\r\npart in the campaign, and preparations were completed by which it\r\nwas expected both parties would act harmoniously together. Clubs\r\nwere formed at whose headquarters were seen men and women gathered\r\ntogether to organize for political work. From some of these\r\nheadquarters hung transparencies with \"Baker and Eddy\" on one side,\r\nand \"Prohibition and Equal Rights\" on the other. Caucuses and\r\nconventions were held in Chelsea, Taunton, Malden, Lynn, Concord,\r\nand other places. A Middlesex county (first district) senatorial\r\nconvention was called and organized by women, and its proceedings\r\nwere fully reported by the Boston newspapers.[127]\r\n\r\nThe nominations made at these caucuses were generally unanimous,\r\nand it seemed at the time as if the two wings of the so-called\r\n\"Baker party\" would work harmoniously together. But, with a few\r\nhonorable exceptions, the Prohibitionists, taking advantage of the\r\nfact that the voting power of the women was over, once outside the\r\ncaucus, repudiated the nominations, or held other caucuses and shut\r\nthe doors of entrance in the faces of the women who represented\r\neither the suffrage or the Prohibitory party. This was the case\r\ninvariably, excepting in towns where the majority of the voting\r\nmembers of the Prohibitory party were also in favor of woman\r\nsuffrage. This result is what might have been expected. Of what use\r\nwas woman in the ranks of any political party, with no vote outside\r\nthe caucus?\r\n\r\nAfter being thus ignored in one of their caucuses in Malden,\r\nMiddlesex county, the suffragists in that town determined to hold\r\nanother caucus. This was accordingly done, and two \"straight\"\r\ncandidates were nominated as town representatives to the\r\nlegislature. A \"Woman Suffrage ticket\"[128] was thereupon printed\r\nto offer to the voters on election day. The next question was, who\r\nwould distribute these ballots most effectively at the polls. Some\r\nmen thought that the women themselves should go and present in\r\nperson the names of their candidates. At first the women who had\r\ncarried on the campaign shrank from this last test of their\r\nfaithfulness; but, after carefully considering the matter, they\r\nconcluded that it was the right thing to do. The repugnance felt at\r\nthat time, at the thought of \"women going to the polls\" can hardly\r\nbe appreciated to-day. Since they have begun to vote in\r\nMassachusetts the terror expressed at the idea of such a proceeding\r\nhas somewhat abated; but in 1876 it was thought to be a rash act\r\nfor a woman to appear at the polls in company with men. Some\r\nattempt was made to deter them from their purpose, and stories of\r\npipes and tobacco and probable insults were told; but they had no\r\nterrors for women who knew better than to believe that their\r\nneighbors would be turned into beasts (like the man in the fairy\r\ntale) for this one day in the year.[129]\r\n\r\nIt was a sight to be remembered, to behold women \"crowned with\r\nhonor\" standing at the polls to see the freed slave go by and vote,\r\nand the newly-naturalized fellow-citizen, and the blind, the\r\nparalytic, the boy of twenty-one with his newly-fledged vote, the\r\ndrunken man who did not know Hayes from Tilden, and the man who\r\nread his ballot upside down. All these voted for the men they\r\nwanted to represent them, but the women, being neither colored, nor\r\nforeign, nor blind, nor paralytic, nor newly-fledged, nor drunk,\r\nnor ignorant, but only _women_, could not vote for the men they\r\nwanted to represent them.[130]\r\n\r\nThe women learned several things during this campaign in\r\nMassachusetts. One was, that weak parties are no more to be trusted\r\nthan strong ones; and another, that men grant but little until the\r\nballot is placed in the hands of those who make the demand. They\r\nlearned also how political caucuses and conventions are managed.\r\nThe resolution passed by the Prohibitionists enabled them to do\r\nthis. So the great \"open sesame\" is reached. It is but fair to\r\nstate that since 1876 the Prohibitory party has treated the woman\r\nsuffrage question with consideration. In its annual convention it\r\nhas passed resolutions endorsing woman's claims to political\r\nequality, and has set the example to other parties of admitting\r\nwomen as delegates. At the State convention in 1885 the following\r\nresolution was adopted by a good majority:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That women having interests to be promoted and rights\r\n     to be protected, and having ability for the discharge of\r\n     political duties, should have the right to vote and to be voted\r\n     for, as is accorded to man.\r\n\r\nIn the early history of Massachusetts, when the new colony was\r\ngoverned by laws set down in the Province charter (1691, third year\r\nof William and Mary) women were not excluded from voting. The\r\nclause in the charter relating to this matter says:\r\n\r\n     The great and general court shall consist of the governor and\r\n     council (or assistants for the time being) and of such\r\n     freeholders as shall be from time to time elected or deputed by\r\n     the major part of the freeholders and other inhabitants of the\r\n     respective towns or places, who shall be present at such\r\n     elections.\r\n\r\nIn the original constitution (1780) women were excluded from voting\r\nexcept for certain State officers.[131] In the constitutional\r\nconvention of 1820, the word \"male\" was first put into the\r\nconstitution of the State, in an amendment to define the\r\nqualifications of voters. In this convention, a motion was made at\r\nthree different times, during the passage of the act, to strike out\r\nthe intruding word, but the motion was voted down. Long before the\r\nsecond attempt was made to revise the constitution of the State,\r\nlarge numbers of women began to demand suffrage. Woman's sphere of\r\noperations and enterprise had become so widened, that they felt\r\nthey had not only the right, but also an increasing fitness for\r\ncivil life and government, of which the ballot is but the sign and\r\nthe symbol.\r\n\r\nIn the constitutional convention of 1853, twelve petitions were\r\npresented, from over 2,000 adult persons, asking for the\r\nrecognition of woman's right to the ballot, in the proposed\r\namendments to the constitution of the State. The committee reported\r\nleave to withdraw, giving as their reason that the \"consent of the\r\ngoverned\" was shown by the small number of petitioners. Hearings\r\nbefore this committee were granted.[132] The chairman of this\r\ncommittee, in presenting the report, moved that all debate on the\r\nsubject should cease in thirty minutes, and on motion of Benjamin\r\nF. Butler of Lowell, the whole report, excepting the last clause,\r\nwas stricken out. There was then left of the whole document\r\n(including more than two closely-printed pages of reasoning) only\r\nthis: \"It is inexpedient for this convention to take any action.\"\r\n\r\nLegislative action on the woman's rights question began in 1849,\r\nwhen William Lloyd Garrison presented the first petition on the\r\nsubject to the State legislature. Following him was one from\r\nJonathan Drake and others, \"for a peaceable secession of\r\nMassachusetts from the Union.\" Both these petitions were probably\r\nconsidered by the legislature to which they were addressed as of\r\nequally incendiary character, since they both had \"leave to\r\nwithdraw.\" In 1851 an order was introduced asking \"whether any\r\nlegislation was necessary concerning the wills of married women?\"\r\nIn 1853 a bill was enacted \"to exempt certain property of widows\r\nand unmarried women from taxation.\" In the legislature of 1856 the\r\nfirst great and important act relating to the property rights of\r\nwomen was passed. It was to the effect that women could hold all\r\nproperty earned or acquired independently of their husbands. This\r\nact was amended and improved the next session.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 a hearing was held before the Committee on the Judiciary to\r\nlisten to arguments in favor of the petition of Lucy Stone and\r\nothers for equal property rights for women and for the \"right of\r\nsuffrage.\" Another hearing was held in the same place in February,\r\n1858, before the Joint Special Committee on the Qualifications of\r\nVoters. A second hearing on the right of suffrage for women was\r\nheld the following week before the same committee. Thomas W.\r\nHigginson made an address and Caroline Kealey Dall read an essay.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, Stephen A. Chase of Salem, from the same Committee on the\r\nQualifications of Voters, made a long report on the petitions. This\r\nreport closed with an order that the State Board of Education make\r\ninquiry and report to the next legislature \"whether it is not\r\npracticable and expedient to provide by law some method by which\r\nthe women of this State may have a more active part in the control\r\nand management of the schools.\" There is nothing in legislative\r\nrecords to show that the State Board of Education reported\r\nfavorably; but from the above statement it appears that ten years\r\nbefore Samuel E. Sewall's petition on the subject, a movement was\r\nmade towards making women \"eligible to serve as members of\r\nschool-committees.\"\r\n\r\nThe petitions for woman's rights were usually circulated by women\r\ngoing from house to house. They did the drudgery, endured the\r\nhardships and suffered the humiliations attendant upon the early\r\nhistory of our cause; but their names are forgotten, and others\r\nreap the benefit of their labors. These women were so modest and so\r\nanxious for the success of their petitions, that they never put\r\ntheir own names at the head of the list, preferring the signature\r\nof some leading man, so that others seeing his name, might be\r\ninduced to follow his example. Among the earliest of these silent\r\nworkers was Mary Upton Ferrin. Her petitions were for a change in\r\nthe laws concerning the property rights of married women, and for\r\nthe political and legal rights of all women. In 1849 she prepared a\r\nmemorial to the Massachusetts legislature in which are embodied\r\nmany of the demands for woman's equality before the law, which have\r\nso often been made to that body since that time.[133]\r\n\r\nIn 1861 the legislature debated a bill to allow a widow, \"if she\r\nhave woodland as a part of her dower, the privilege of cutting wood\r\nenough for one fire.\" This bill failed, and the widow, by law, was\r\n_not_ allowed to keep herself warm with fuel from her own wood-lot.\r\nIn 1863 a bill providing that \"a wife may be allowed to be a\r\nwitness and proceed against her husband for desertion,\" was\r\nreported inexpedient, and a bill was passed to _prevent_ women from\r\nforming copartnerships in business. In 1865, Gov. John A. Andrew,\r\nseeing the magnitude of the approaching woman question, in his\r\nannual message to the legislature, made a memorable suggestion:\r\n\r\n     I know of no more useful object to which the commonwealth can\r\n     lend its aid, than that of a movement, adopted in a practical\r\n     way, to open the door of emigration to young women who are wanted\r\n     for teachers and for every appropriate, as well as domestic,\r\n     employment in the remote West, but who are leading anxious and\r\n     aimless lives in New England.\r\n\r\nBy the \"anxious and aimless\" it was supposed the governor meant the\r\nwidowed, single or otherwise unrepresented portion of the citizens\r\nof the State. No action was taken by the legislature on this\r\nportion of the governor's message. But a member of the Senate\r\nactually made the following proposition before that body:\r\n\r\n     That the \"anxious and aimless women\" of the State should assemble\r\n     on the Common on a certain day of the year (to be hereafter\r\n     named), and that Western men who wanted wives, should be invited\r\n     to come here and select them.\r\n\r\nLegislators who make such propositions, do not foresee that the\r\ntime may come, when perhaps those nearest and dearest to them, may\r\nbe classed among the superfluous or \"anxious and aimless\" women!\r\n\r\nIn 1865 bills allowing married women to testify in suits at law\r\nwhere their husbands are parties, and permitting them to hold trust\r\nestates were rejected. It will be seen that though all this\r\nlegislation was adverse to woman's interest, the question had\r\nforced itself upon the attention of the members of both House and\r\nSenate. In 1866 a joint committee of both houses was appointed to\r\nconsider:\r\n\r\n     If any additional legislation can be adopted, whereby the means\r\n     of obtaining a livelihood by the women of this commonwealth may\r\n     be increased and a more equal and just compensation be allowed\r\n     for their labor.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, Francis W. Bird presented the petition of Mehitable\r\nHaskell of Gloucester for \"an amendment to the constitution\r\nextending suffrage to women.\" In 1868 Mr. King of Boston presented\r\nthe same petition, and it was at this time, and in answer thereto,\r\nthat the subject first entered into the regular orders of the day,\r\nand became a part of the official business of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Attempts to legislate on the property question\r\nwere continued in 1868, in bills \"to further protect the property\r\nof married women,\" \"to allow married women to contract for\r\nnecessaries,\" and if \"divorced from bed and board, to allow them to\r\ndispose of their own property.\" These bills were all defeated.\r\nAnnual legislative hearings on woman suffrage began in 1869. These\r\nwere first secured through the efforts of the executive committee\r\nof the New England Woman Suffrage Association. Eight thousand women\r\nhad petitioned the legislature that suffrage might be allowed them\r\non the same terms as men, and in answer, two hearings were held in\r\nthe green room at the State House.[134] In 1870 a joint special\r\ncommittee on woman suffrage was formed, and since that time there\r\nhave been one or more annual hearings on the question. To what\r\nextent legislative sentiment has been created will be shown later\r\nin the improvement of many laws with regard to the legal status of\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nWilliam Claflin was the first governor of Massachusetts to present\r\nofficially to the voters of the commonwealth the subject of woman's\r\nrights as a citizen. In his address to the legislature of 1871, he\r\nstrongly recommended a change in the laws regarding suffrage and\r\nthe property rights of woman. His attitude toward this reform made\r\nan era in the history of the executive department of the State.\r\nSince that time nearly every governor of the State has, in\r\nhis annual message, recommended the subject to respectful\r\nconsideration. In 1879 Governor Thomas Talbot proposed a\r\nconstitutional amendment which should secure the ballot to women on\r\nthe same terms as to men. In response to this portion of the\r\ngovernor's message, and to the ninety-eight petitions presented on\r\nthe subject, a general suffrage bill passed the Senate by a\r\ntwo-thirds majority, and an act to \"give women the right to vote\r\nfor members of school committees,\" passed both branches of the\r\nlegislature and became a law of the State.[135] Governor John D.\r\nLong, in his inaugural address before the legislature of 1880,\r\nexpressed his opinion in favor of woman suffrage perhaps more\r\ndecidedly than any who had preceded him in that high official\r\nposition. He said:\r\n\r\n     I repeat my conviction of the right of woman suffrage. If the\r\n     commonwealth is not ready to give it in full by a constitutional\r\n     amendment, I approve of testing it in municipal elections.\r\n\r\nThe law allowing women to vote for school committees is one of the\r\nlast results of the legislative agitations, though it is true that\r\nthe petition, the answer to which was the passage of this act, did\r\nnot emanate from any suffrage association. It was the outcome of a\r\nconference on the subject, held in the parlors of the New England\r\nWomen's Club.[136]\r\n\r\nBut the petitions of the suffragists had always been for general\r\nand unrestricted suffrage, and they opposed any scheme for securing\r\nthe ballot on a class or a restricted basis, holding that the true\r\nground of principle is equality of rights with man. The practical\r\nresult, so far, of voting for school committees has justified this\r\nposition; for, as shown by the recent elections, the women of the\r\nState have not availed themselves to any extent of their new right\r\nto vote, and, therefore, the measure has not forwarded the cause of\r\ngeneral suffrage. In fact, the school-committee question is not a\r\nvital one with either male or female voters, and it is impossible\r\nto get up any enthusiasm on the subject. As a test question upon\r\nwhich to try the desire of the women of the State to become voters,\r\nit is a palpable sham. Our Revolutionary fathers would not have\r\nfought, bled and died for such a figment of a right as this; and\r\ntheir daughters, or grand-daughters, inherit the same spirit, and\r\nif they vote at all, want something worth voting for. The result\r\nis, that the voting has been largely done by those women who have\r\nlong been in favor of suffrage, and who have gone to the polls on\r\nelection day from pure principle and a sense of duty.[137]\r\n\r\nThe law allowing women to vote for school committees was very\r\nelastic and capable of many interpretations. It reminded one of the\r\nold school exercise in transposing the famous line in Gray's Elegy,\r\n\r\n     \"The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,\"\r\n\r\nwhich has been found to be capable of over twenty different\r\ntranspositions. The collectors and registrars in some towns and\r\ncities took advantage of this obscurity of expression, and\r\ninterpreted the law according to their individual opinion on the\r\nwoman suffrage question. In places where these officials were in\r\nsympathy, a broad construction was put upon the provisions of the\r\nlaw, the poll-tax payers were allowed to vote upon the payment of\r\none dollar (under the divided tax law of 1879), and the women\r\nvoters generally were given all necessary information, and treated\r\ncourteously both by the assessors and registrars and at the polls.\r\nIn places where leading officials were opposed to women's voting,\r\nthe case was far different. Without regarding the clause in the law\r\nwhich said that a woman may vote upon paying either State or county\r\npoll-tax, such officials have threatened the women with arrest when\r\nthey refused to pay both. In some towns they have been treated with\r\ngreat indignity, as if they were doing an unlawful act. In one town\r\nthe women were actually required to pay a poll-tax the second year,\r\nin spite of the clause in the law that a female citizen who has\r\npaid a State or county tax within two years shall have the right to\r\nvote. The town assessor, whose duty it was to inform the women on\r\nthis point of the law when asked concerning the matter, _willfully_\r\nwithheld the desired information, saying he \"did not know,\" though\r\nhe afterwards said that he _did_ know, but intended to let the\r\nwomen \"find out for themselves.\" This assessor forgot that the\r\nwomen, as legal voters, had a right to ask for this information,\r\nand that by virtue of his official position he was legally obliged\r\nto answer. In another town two ladies who were property tax-payers\r\nwere made to pay the two dollars poll-tax, and the record of this\r\nstill stands on the town books. Some ladies were frightened and\r\npaid the tax under protest; others ran the risk. Here is a letter\r\naddressed to a lady 83 years of age:\r\n\r\n                                   MALDEN, Dec. 2, 1879.\r\n\r\n     HARRIET HANSON: There is a balance of ninety cents due on your\r\n     poll-tax of 1879, duly assessed upon you. Payment of the same is\r\n     hereby demanded, and if not paid within fourteen days from this\r\n     date, with twenty cents for the summons, the collector is\r\n     required to proceed forthwith to collect the same in manner\r\n     provided by law.\r\n\r\n                                   THEODORE N. FOGUE, _Collector_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hanson paid no attention to the summons, and that was the end\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, under the amended act the poll-tax was reduced to fifty\r\ncents, and the property tax-paying women (who are not required to\r\npay a poll-tax) are no longer obliged to make a return of property\r\nexempt from taxation, as was required under the original statute.\r\nThough some of the disabilities were removed, yet the privileges\r\nare no greater; and it is for members of school-committees and for\r\nnothing else, that the women of this State can vote. This is hardly\r\nworthy to be called \"school suffrage\"! It is to be regretted that a\r\nbetter test than that of school-committee suffrage, could not have\r\nbeen given to the women of the State, so that the issue of what\r\nunder the circumstances cannot be called a fair trial of their\r\ndesire to vote, might be more nearly what the friends of reform had\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nThe first petition to the Massachusetts legislature, asking that\r\nwomen might be allowed to serve on school-boards was presented in\r\n1866 by Samuel E. Sewall of Boston. The same petition was again\r\npresented in 1867. About this time Ashfield and Monroe, two of the\r\nsmallest towns in the State, elected women as members of the school\r\ncommittee. Worcester and Lynn soon followed the good example, and\r\nin 1874, Boston, for the first time, chose six women to serve in\r\nthis capacity.[138] There had hitherto been no open objection to\r\nthis innovation, but the school committee of Boston not liking the\r\nidea of women co-workers, declared them ineligible to hold such\r\noffice. Miss Peabody applied to the Supreme Court for its opinion\r\nupon the matter, but the judges refused to answer, and dismissed\r\nthe petition on the ground that the school committee itself had\r\npower to decide the question of the qualifications of members of\r\nthe board. The subject was brought before the legislature of the\r\nsame year, and that body, almost unanimously, passed \"An Act to\r\nDeclare Women Eligible to Serve as Members of School Committees.\"\r\nThus the women members were reinstated.[139]\r\n\r\nThis refusal on the part of the Supreme Judicial Court of\r\nMassachusetts to answer a question relating to woman's rights under\r\nthe law, was received with a knowing smile by those who remembered\r\nthe three adverse decisions relating to women which had been given\r\nby that august body. The first of these was on the case of Sarah E.\r\nWall of Worcester. The second was concerning a clause in the will\r\nof Francis Jackson of Boston, who left $5,000 and other property to\r\nthe woman's rights cause. Its third adverse decision was given in\r\n1871. In that year, Julia Ward Howe and Mary E. Stevens were\r\nappointed by Governor Claflin as justices of the peace. Some member\r\nof the governor's council having doubted whether women could\r\nlegally hold the office, the opinion of the Supreme Court was asked\r\nand it decided substantially that because women were women, or\r\nbecause women were not _men_, they could _not_ be justices of the\r\npeace; and the appointment was not confirmed.\r\n\r\nChanges in the common law began in 1845 with reference to the\r\nwife's right to hold her own property. In 1846 she could legally\r\nsign a receipt for money earned or deposited by herself.[140]\r\nBefore 1855 a woman could not hold her own property, either earned\r\nor acquired by inheritance. If unmarried, she was obliged to place\r\nit in the hands of a trustee, to whose will she was subject. If she\r\ncontemplated marriage, and desired to call her property her own,\r\nshe was forced by law to make a contract with her intended husband,\r\nby which she gave up all title or claim to it. A woman, either\r\nmarried or unmarried, could hold no office of trust or power. She\r\nwas not a person. She was not recognized as a citizen. She was not\r\na factor in the human family. She was not a unit; but a zero, a\r\nnothing, in the sum of civilization.\r\n\r\nTo-day, a married woman can hold her own property, if it is held or\r\nbought in her own name, and can make a will disposing of it. A man\r\nis no longer the sole heir of his wife's property. A married woman\r\ncan make contracts, enter into co-partnerships, carry on business,\r\ninvest her own earnings for her own use and behoof,--and she is\r\nalso responsible for her own debts. She can be executor,\r\nadministrator, guardian or trustee. She can testify in the courts\r\nfor or against her husband. She can release, transfer, or convey,\r\nany interest she may have in real estate, subject only to the life\r\ninterest which the husband may have at her death. Thirty years ago,\r\nwhen the woman's rights movement began, the status of a married\r\nwoman was little better than that of a domestic servant. By the\r\nEnglish common law, her husband was her lord and master. He had the\r\nsole custody of her person, and of her minor children. He could\r\n\"punish her with a stick no bigger than his thumb,\" and she could\r\nnot complain against him.[141] But the real \"thumb\" story seems to\r\nhave originated with a certain Judge Buller of England, who lived\r\nabout one hundred years ago. In his ruling on one of those cases of\r\nwife-beating, now so common in our police courts, he said that a\r\nman had a right to punish his wife, \"with a stick no bigger than\r\nhis thumb.\" That was his opinion. Shortly after this some ladies\r\nsent the judge a letter in which they prayed him to give the size\r\nof his thumb! We are not told whether he complied with their\r\nrequest.]\r\n\r\nThe common law of this State held man and wife to be one person,\r\nbut that person was the husband. He could by will deprive her of\r\nevery part of his property, and also of what had been her own\r\nbefore marriage. He was the owner of all her real estate and of her\r\nearnings. The wife could make no contract and no will, nor, without\r\nher husband's consent, dispose of the legal interest of her real\r\nestate. He had the income of her real estate till she died, and if\r\nthey ever had a living child his ownership of the real estate\r\ncontinued to his death. He could forbid her to buy a loaf of bread\r\nor a pound of sugar, or contract for a load of wood to keep the\r\nfamily warm. She did not own a rag of her own clothing. She had no\r\npersonal rights, and could hardly call her soul her own.\r\n\r\nHer husband could steal her children, rob her of her clothing, and\r\nher earnings, neglect to support the family; and she had no legal\r\nredress. If a wife earned money by her labor, the husband could\r\nclaim the pay as his share of the proceeds. There is a clause\r\nsometimes found in old wills, to the effect that if a widow marry\r\nagain, she shall forfeit all right to her husband's property. The\r\nmost conservative judge in the commonwealth would now rule that a\r\nwidow cannot be kept from her fair share of the property, by any\r\nsuch unjust restriction. In a husband's eyes of a hundred and fifty\r\nyears ago, a woman's mission was accomplished after she had been\r\n_his_ wife and borne _his_ children. What more could be desired of\r\nher, he argued, but a corner somewhere in which, respectably\r\ndressed as his _relict_, she could sit down and mourn for him, for\r\nthe rest of her life.[142]\r\n\r\nThe law no longer sanctions such a will, but provides that the\r\nwidow shall have a fair share of all personal property. If a widow\r\npermits herself to-day to be defrauded of her legal rights in the\r\ndivision of property, it is her own fault, and because she does not\r\nstudy and understand for herself the general statutes of\r\nMassachusetts, and the laws concerning the rights of married women.\r\nThe result of thirty years of property legislation for women is\r\nwell stated by Mr. Sewall in his admirable pamphlet, in which he\r\nsays, \"the last thirty years have done more to improve the law for\r\nmarried women than the four hundred preceding.\" The legislature\r\nhas, during this time, enacted laws allowing women to vote in\r\nparishes and religious societies, declaring that women _must_\r\nbecome members of the board of trustees of the three State primary\r\nand reform schools, of the State workhouse, of the State almshouse\r\nat Tewksbury, and of the board of prison commissioners; also, that\r\ncertain officers and managers of the reformatory prison for women\r\nat Sherborn \"shall be women.\" Without legislation, women now are\r\nschool supervisors, overseers of the poor, trustees of public\r\nlibraries and members of the State Board of Education and of the\r\nState Board of Health, Lunacy and Charity.[143]\r\n\r\nThese great changes in legislation for the women of Massachusetts\r\nare the result of their own labors. By conventions and documents\r\nthey have informed the people and enlightened public sentiment. By\r\ncontinued agitation the question has been kept prominently before\r\ntheir representatives in the legislature. And, though so much has\r\nbeen gained, they are still hard at work, nor will they rest until,\r\nwoman's equality with man before the law is firmly established.\r\n\r\nAmong the most important acts passed recently is one of 1879, by\r\nwhich a married woman is the owner of her own clothing to the value\r\nof $2,000, although the act granting this calls such apparel the\r\n\"gifts of her husband,\" not recognizing the fact that most married\r\nwomen earn or help to earn their own clothes. A law was passed, in\r\n1881, to \"mitigate the evils of divorce.\" Two important acts were\r\npassed by the legislature of 1882, one allowing women to become\r\npractising attorneys, and the other providing, that in case of the\r\ndeath of a married woman intestate and leaving children, one-half\r\nonly of her personal estate shall go to her husband, instead of the\r\nwhole, as in previous years. In 1883, a wife was given the right of\r\nburial in any lot or tomb belonging to her husband. In 1884, the\r\nonly measures were a bill providing for the appointment of women on\r\nthe board of State lunatic hospitals, and another providing for the\r\nappointment of women assistant physicians in the same hospitals,\r\nand an act giving women the power to dispose of their separate\r\nestates by will or deed. In 1885, very little was done to improve\r\nthe legal status of women.\r\n\r\nWhen any vote on the Suffrage bill is taken, it is enough to make\r\nthe women who sit in the gallery weep to hear the \"O's\" and the\r\n\"Mc's,\" almost to a man, thunder forth the emphatic \"_No!_\"; and to\r\nthink that these men (some of whom a few years ago were walking\r\nover their native bogs, with hardly the right to live and breathe)\r\nshould vote away so thoughtlessly the rights of the women of the\r\ncountry in which they have found a shelter and a home. When they\r\ncame to this country, poor, and with no inheritance but the\r\n\"shillalah,\" the ballot was freely given to them, as the poor man's\r\nweapon for defence. Why cannot men, who have been political serfs\r\nin their own country, see the incongruity of voting against the\r\nenfranchisement of over one-half of the inhabitants of the State\r\nwhich has made free human beings of them? It is not long since one\r\nof these adopted citizens, in a discussion, said:\r\n\r\n     When the women show that they want to vote, I am willing to give\r\n     them all the rights they want.\r\n\r\nGive! I thought. Where did you get the right to _give_\r\nMassachusetts women the right to vote? You did not inherit it. In\r\nwhat consists your prerogative over the women whose ancestors\r\nfought to secure the very right of suffrage of which you so glibly\r\ntalk, and which neither you, nor your father before you, did aught\r\nto establish or maintain?\r\n\r\nThe improvement in the social or general condition of woman has\r\nbeen even greater than that in legislation. Previous to 1840, women\r\nwere employed only as teachers of summer schools, to \"spell the\r\nmen\" during the haying season; and this only occasionally. They\r\nheld no responsible position in any public school in the State.\r\nTo-day there are eight women to one man employed in all grades of\r\nthis profession, and there are numerous instances where women are\r\nhead-teachers of departments, or principals of high, normal and\r\ngrammar schools. Previous to 1825, girls could attend only the\r\nprimary schools of Boston. Through the influence of Rev. John\r\nPierpont, the first high-school for girls was opened in that city.\r\nThere was a great outcry against this innovation; and, because of\r\nthe excitement on the subject, and the _great number of girls_ who\r\napplied for admission, the scheme was abandoned. The public-school\r\nsystem, as it is now called, was established in Boston in 1789;\r\nboys were admitted the whole year round; girls, from April to\r\nOctober. This inequality in the opportunities for education roused\r\nJohn Pierpont's indignation, and moved him to make strenuous\r\nefforts to secure justice for girls. Now there are 6,246 schools,\r\nseventy-two academies, six normal schools, two colleges, Boston\r\nUniversity and the \"Harvard Annex\" all open to girls. In the town\r\nof Plymouth, where the Pilgrim fathers and mothers first landed,\r\nwhen the question whether girls should receive any public\r\ninstruction first came up in town-meeting, there was great\r\nopposition to it. However, the majority showed a liberal spirit,\r\nand voted to give the girls one hour of instruction daily. This\r\nwas in 1793. In 1853 a normal school for girls was established in\r\nBoston; in 1855 its name was changed to the Girls' High and Normal\r\nSchool. In 1878 the Girls' Latin School in Boston was founded. The\r\nestablishment of this successful institution was the result of\r\ndiscussions on the subject first brought before the public by\r\nladies of Boston. High schools in almost all the towns and cities\r\nof the State have long been established, in which the boys and\r\ngirls are educated together. In 1880 the pupils in the high and\r\nnormal schools of Boston were about 2,000 girls to 1,000 boys. In\r\n1867 the Lowell Institute and the Massachusetts Institute of\r\nTechnology advertised classes free to both sexes in French,\r\nmathematics and in practical science.[144] Since that time Chauncy\r\nHall School and Boston University have been opened to women, with\r\nthe equal privileges of male students. It might be explained here\r\nthat the \"Harvard Annex,\" or \"Private Collegiate Instruction for\r\nWomen,\" is not an organic part of the University itself. Under a\r\ncertain arrangement, a limited number of young women are allowed a\r\nfew of the privileges of the young men. They are also permitted to\r\nuse all the books belonging to the library and to attend many of\r\nthe lectures. No college-building is appropriated for this purpose,\r\nbut recitation-rooms are provided in private houses. A witty\r\nCambridge lady called this mythical college the \"Harvard Annex\";\r\nthe public adopted the name, and many people suppose that there is\r\nsuch a building. From the last annual report of the \"Private\r\nCollegiate Instruction for Women,\" it appears that in 1885\r\nsixty-five women availed themselves of the privilege of attending\r\nthis course of instruction.[145] Three-fourths of this number are\r\nMassachusetts girls. Some of the professors say that the average of\r\nscholarship there is higher than in the University. Fifty courses\r\nof studies are open to women students. Miss Brown of Concord, a\r\ngraduate of 1884, astonished the faculty by her high per cent. in\r\nthe classics. Her average was higher than that reached by any young\r\nman. These students go unattended to the lectures and to the\r\nlibrary of the college. A great change indeed, since the time when\r\nwomen began to attend the Lowell Institute lectures! Then it was\r\nthought almost disgraceful to go to a public meeting without male\r\nprotection, and they went with veiled faces, as if ashamed to be\r\nseen of men. The \"Annex\" has some advantages, but they cannot\r\ncompare with Girton and Newnham of Cambridge, England.\r\n\r\nThe treasurer of the \"Harvard Annex\" declares the great need that\r\nexists for funds to provide a suitable building, etc., for the\r\nnumerous women who continue to apply there for admission; and he\r\nappeals to the generosity of the public for contributions of money\r\nto be used for this purpose. The casual observer might suggest that\r\nthose women who will hereafter become the benefactors of this\r\nuniversity should remember the needs of their own sex, and leave\r\ntheir donations or bequests so that they can be used for the\r\nbenefit of the \"Harvard Annex,\" which is a wholly private\r\nenterprise, conducted by the University instructors and supervised\r\nby a committee of ladies.\r\n\r\nColleges for women have also been founded. Wellesley and Smith have\r\nlong been doing good university work. Thirty years ago there was no\r\ncollege in the country, except Oberlin, to which women were\r\nadmitted. To-day, even conservative Harvard begins to melt a little\r\nunder this regenerating influence, and invites women, through the\r\ndoors of its \"Annex,\" to come and enjoy some of the privileges\r\nfound within its sacred halls of learning. This was a late act of\r\ngrace from a college whose inception was in the mind of a\r\nwoman[146] longing for a better opportunity than the new colony\r\ncould give to educate her afterward ungrateful son.\r\n\r\nThe number of young men educated by the individual efforts of women\r\ncannot be estimated. T. W. Higginson, in the _Woman's Journal_,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     The late President Walker once told me that, in his judgment,\r\n     one-quarter of the young men in Harvard College were being\r\n     carried through by the special self-denial and sacrifices of\r\n     women. I cannot answer for the ratio, but I can testify to having\r\n     been an instance of this, myself; and to having known a\r\n     never-ending series of such cases of self-devotion.\r\n\r\nSome of these men, educated by the labor and self-sacrifice of\r\nothers, look down upon the social position in which their women\r\nfriends are still forced to remain. The result to the recipient has\r\noften been of doubtful value, so far as the development of the\r\naffections is concerned. Sometimes the great obligation has been\r\nforgotten. Only in rare instances, to either party did the\r\nlife-long sacrifice on the part of the women of the family become\r\nof permanent and spiritual value!\r\n\r\nThe average woman of forty years ago was very humble in her notions\r\nof the sphere of woman. What if she did hunger and thirst after\r\nknowledge? She could do nothing with it, even if she could get it.\r\nSo she made a _fetich_ of some male relative, and gave him the\r\nmental food for which she herself was starving, and devoted all her\r\nenergies towards helping him to become what she felt, under better\r\nconditions, she herself might have been. It was enough in those\r\nearly days to be the _mother_ or _sister_ of somebody. Women were\r\nalmost as abject in this particular as the Thracian woman of old,\r\nwho said:\r\n\r\n    \"I am not of the noble Grecian race,\r\n    I'm poor Abrotonon, and born in Thrace;\r\n    Let the Greek women scorn me, if they please,\r\n    I was the mother of Themistocles.\"\r\n\r\nThere are women still left who believe their husbands, sons, or\r\nmale friends can study, read and _vote_ for them. They are like\r\nsome frugal house-mothers, who think their is no need of a dinner\r\nif the good-man of the family is not coming home to share it. Just\r\nas if the man-half of the human family can \"eat, learn and inwardly\r\ndigest,\" to make either physical or mental strength for the other\r\nhalf!\r\n\r\nMaria Mitchell of Massachusetts became Professor of Astronomy and\r\nMathematics at Vassar, in 1866, the first woman in the country to\r\nhold such a position. Since that time women have become members of\r\nthe faculty in several of the large colleges in the country.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the commonwealth women practiced midwifery,\r\nand were very successful. Mrs. John Eliot, Anne Hutchinson, Mrs.\r\nFuller and Sarah Alcock were the first in the State. Janet\r\nAlexander, a Scotchwoman, was a well-trained midwife.[147] She\r\nlived in Boston, and was always recognized as a good practitioner\r\nin her line by the leading doctors in that city. Dr. John C. Warren\r\nof Boston invited this lady to come to this country. His biography,\r\nrecently published, contains a short record of the matter, in which\r\nhe says: \"We determined to recommend Mrs. Alexander. She was a\r\nScotchwoman, regularly educated, and having Dr. Hamilton's\r\ndiploma.\" Quite a storm was raised among the younger physicians of\r\nBoston by this attempted innovation, because they thought Dr.\r\nWarren was trying to deprive them of profitable practice. But Mrs.\r\nAlexander, supported by Dr. Warren, and perhaps other physicians,\r\ncontinued her occupation and educated her daughter in the same\r\nprofession. Dr. Harriot K. Hunt practiced in Boston as early as\r\n1835. She sought admission to the Harvard Medical School, and was\r\nmany times refused. She was not what is called a \"regular\r\nphysician.\" In her day there existed no schools or colleges for the\r\nmedical education of women, but she studied by herself, and\r\nacquired some knowledge of diseases peculiar to women. Her success\r\nwas so great in her line of practice that she proved the need\r\nexisting for physicians of her own sex.\r\n\r\nDr. Hunt's tussle with the medical faculty will long be remembered.\r\nShe was the first woman in the State who dared assert her right to\r\nrecognition in this profession. For this, and for her persistent\r\nefforts to secure for them a higher education, she deserves the\r\ngratitude of every woman who has since followed her footsteps into\r\na profession over which the men had long held undisputed control.\r\nIn 1853 the degree of M. D. was conferred on her by the Woman's\r\nMedical College of Pennsylvania. The first medical college for\r\nwomen, organized by Dr. Samuel Gregory of Boston, was chartered in\r\n1856, under the name of the New England Female Medical College, and\r\nin 1874, by an act of the legislature, united with the Boston\r\nUniversity School of Medicine. In 1868 it had graduated seventy-two\r\nwomen, among whom were Dr. Lucy E. Sewall and Dr. Helen Morton (who\r\nafterwards went to Paris and studied obstetrics at Madame Aillot's\r\nHospital of Maternity) and Dr. Mercy B. Jackson.[148] There are now\r\n205 regular practitioners in the State.\r\n\r\nIn 1863, Dr. Zakrzewska, in cooeperation with Lucy Goddard and Ednah\r\nD. Cheney, established the New England Hospital for Women and\r\nChildren. Its avowed objects were: (1) to provide women the medical\r\naid of competent physicians of their own sex; (2) to assist\r\neducated women in the practical study of medicine; (3) to train\r\nnurses for the care of the sick. This was the first hospital in New\r\nEngland over which women have had entire control, both as\r\nphysicians and surgeons. Boston University is open to both sexes,\r\nwith equal studies, duties and privileges. This institution was\r\nincorporated in 1869, and includes, among other schools and\r\ncolleges, schools of theology, law and medicine. The faculty\r\nconsists of many distinguished men and women. Boston University\r\nSchool of Medicine (homeopathic) was organized in 1873. Of the\r\nthirty-two lecturers and professors who constitute the faculty,\r\nfive are women. In 1884 the three highest of the four prizes for\r\nthe best medical thesis were won by women. Of the 610 pupils in\r\n1884, 155 were women; sixty of these were in the school of\r\nmedicine. There are women in all departments, except agriculture\r\nand theology. They do not study theology because they cannot be\r\nordained to preach in any of the leading churches.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Medical Society in 1884, on motion of Dr. Henry\r\nI. Bowditch, voted to admit women to membership. Dr. Emma L. Call\r\nand Dr. Harriet L. Harrington were the first two women admitted.\r\nJanuary 11, 1882, at the monthly meeting of Harvard overseers, the\r\nquestion of admitting women to the Medical School came before the\r\nboard. An individual desiring to contribute a fund for the medical\r\neducation of women in Harvard University asked the president and\r\nfellows whether such a fund would be accepted and used as designed.\r\nMajority and minority reports were submitted by the committee in\r\ncharge, and after a long discussion it was voted, 11 to 6, to\r\naccept the fund, the income to be ultimately used for the medical\r\neducation of women. At the April meeting, the Committee on the\r\nMedical Education of Women presented a report, which was adopted by\r\na vote of 13 to 12:\r\n\r\n     That, in the opinion of the board, it is not advisable for the\r\n     University to hold out any encouragement that it will undertake\r\n     the medical education of women.\r\n\r\nThe Harvard Divinity School at Cambridge sometimes admits women,\r\nbut does not recognize them publicly, nor grant them degrees; but\r\nthere are other theological schools in the State where a complete\r\npreparation for the ministerial profession can be obtained. The\r\nattitude of the churches toward women has changed greatly within\r\nthirty years. As early as 1869, women began to serve on committees,\r\nand to be ordained deaconesses of churches. They also hold\r\nimportant offices connected with the different church\r\norganizations. They serve on the boards of State and national\r\nreligious associations. There are also missionary associations,\r\nboth home and foreign, and Christian unions, all officered and\r\nmanaged exclusively by women. Even the treasurers of these large\r\nbodies are women, and their husbands or trustees are no longer\r\nrequired to give bonds for them.[149] At the general conference of\r\nthe Methodist Episcopal Church, the word \"male\" was stricken from\r\nthe discipline, and the word \"person\" inserted in its place, in all\r\ncases save those that concerned the ordination of clergy.\r\n\r\nOlympia Brown was the first woman settled as pastor in the State.\r\nHer parish was at Weymouth Landing. In 1864 she petitioned the\r\nMassachusetts legislature \"that marriages performed by a woman\r\nshould be made legal.\" The Committee on the Judiciary, to whom the\r\nmatter was referred, reported that no legislation was necessary, as\r\nmarriages solemnized by women were already legal.[150] Thus the\r\nlegislature of the State established the precedent, that \"he\" meant\r\n\"she\" under the law, in one instance at least. Phebe Hanaford, Mary\r\nH. Graves and Lorenza Haynes were the first Massachusetts women to\r\nbe ordained preachers of the gospel. Rev. Lorenza Haynes has been\r\nchaplain of the Maine House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe three best-known women sculptors in this country were born and\r\nbred in Massachusetts. They are Harriet Hosmer, Margaret Foley and\r\nAnne Whitney. Harriet Hosmer was the first to free herself from the\r\ntraditions of her sex and follow her profession as a sculptor. When\r\nshe desired to fit herself for her vocation there was no art school\r\neast of the Mississippi river where she could study anatomy, or\r\nfind suitable models. Margaret Foley, who, amid the hum of the\r\nmachinery of the Lowell cotton mills, first conceived the idea of\r\nchiseling her thought on the surface of a \"smooth-lipped shell,\"\r\nwas obliged to go to Rome in order to get the necessary instruction\r\nin cameo-cutting. There her genius developed so much that she began\r\nto model in clay, and soon became a successful sculptor in marble.\r\nLucy Larcom, in her \"Idyl of Work,\" says of Miss Foley:\r\n\r\n    \"That broad-browed delicate girl will carve at Rome\r\n    Faces in marble, classic as her own.\"\r\n\r\nOne of her finest creations is \"The Fountain,\" first exhibited in\r\nHorticultural Hall at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia,\r\n1876. A free art-school was opened to women in Boston in 1867, and\r\nAnne Whitney was not obliged to go to Rome for instruction in the\r\nappliances of her art. Harriet Hosmer and Margaret Foley have both\r\nmade statues which adorn the public buildings and parks of their\r\nnative country; and Anne Whitney's statues of Samuel Adams and\r\nHarriet Martineau are the crowning works of her genius.\r\n\r\nNo great work has yet been done by Massachusetts women in oil\r\npainting; but in water colors, and in decorative art, many have\r\nexcelled, first prizes in superiority of design having been taken\r\nby them over their masculine competitors. Lizzie B. Humphrey,\r\nJessie Curtis, Sarah W. Whitman and Fidelia Bridges, take high rank\r\nas artists. Helen M. Knowlton, a pupil of William M. Hunt, is a\r\nskillful artist in charcoal and has produced some fine pictures.\r\nWomen form a large proportion of the students in the school of\r\ndesign recently opened in Boston. A great deal of the ornamental\r\npainting now so fashionable on cards and all fancy articles is done\r\nby the deft fingers of women. The census of 1880 reports 268\r\nartists and 1,270 musicians and teachers of music.\r\n\r\nOf woman as actress and public singer, it is unnecessary to speak,\r\nsince she has the right of way in both these professions. Here,\r\nfortunately, the supply does not exceed the demand; consequently\r\nshe has her full share of rights, and what is better, equitable pay\r\nfor her labor. In 1880 there were 111 actresses. Charlotte Cushman,\r\nClara Louise Kellogg and Annie Louise Cary were born in\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe drama speaks too feebly on the right side of the woman\r\nquestion. No successful modern dramatist has made this \"humour\" of\r\nthe times the subject of his play. An effort was made in 1879, by\r\nthe executive committee of the New England Association, to secure a\r\nwoman suffrage play: but it was not successful, and there is yet to\r\nbe written a counteractive to that popular burlesque, \"The Spirit\r\nof '76.\" It is to be regretted that the stage still continues to\r\nridicule the woman's rights movement and its leaders; for, as\r\nHamlet says:\r\n\r\n                \"The play's the thing,\r\n    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1650, when Anne Bradstreet lived and wrote her verses, a woman\r\nauthor was almost unknown in English literature. This lady was the\r\nwife of the governor of Massachusetts, and because of her literary\r\ntendencies was looked upon by the people of her time as a marvel of\r\nwomankind. Her contemporaries called her the \"tenth muse lately\r\nsprung up in America,\" and one of them, Rev. Nathaniel Ward, was\r\ninspired to write an address to her, in which he declares his\r\nwonder at her success as a poet, and playfully foretells the\r\nconsequences if women are permitted to intrude farther into the\r\ndomain of man. The closing lines express so well the conflicting\r\nemotions which torment the minds of the opponents of the woman\r\nsuffrage movement, that I venture to quote them:\r\n\r\n    \"Good sooth,\" quoth the old Don, \"tell ye me so?\r\n    I muse whither at length these Girls will go.\r\n    It half revives my chil, frost-bitten blood\r\n    To see a woman once do aught that's good.\r\n    And, chode by Chaucer's Boots and Homer's Furrs,\r\n    Let men look to't least Women wear the Spurrs.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1818, Hannah Mather Crocker, grand-daughter of Cotton Mather,\r\npublished a book, called \"Observations on the Rights of Women.\" In\r\nspeaking of Mary Wollstonecraft, Mrs. Crocker says, that while that\r\ncelebrated woman had a very independent mind, and her \"Rights of\r\nWoman\" is replete with fine sentiments, yet, she continues,\r\npatronizingly, \"we do not coincide with her respecting the total\r\nindependence of the sex.\" Mrs. Crocker evidently wanted her sex to\r\nbe not too independent, but just independent enough.[151]\r\n\r\nIn 1841, when Lydia Maria Child edited the _Anti-Slavery Standard_,\r\nMargaret Fuller the _Dial_, and Harriot F. Curtis and Harriet\r\nFarley the _Lowell Offering_, there were perhaps in New England no\r\nother well-known women journalists or editors. Cornelia Walter of\r\nthe _Evening Transcript_ was the first woman journalist in Boston.\r\nTo-day, women are editors and publishers of newspapers all over the\r\nUnited States; and the woman's column is a part of many leading\r\nnewspapers. Sallie Joy White was the first regular reporter in\r\nBoston. She began on the _Boston Post_, a Democratic newspaper, in\r\n1870. Her first work was to report the proceedings of a woman\r\nsuffrage meeting. She is now on the staff of the _Boston Daily\r\nAdvertiser_. Lilian Whiting is on the staff of the _Traveller_, and\r\nmost of the other Boston newspapers have women among their editors\r\nand reporters. Some of the best magazine writing of the time is\r\ndone by women; one needs but to look over the table of contents of\r\nthe leading periodicals to see how large a proportion of the\r\narticles is written by them. Really, the sex seems to have taken\r\npossession of what Carlyle called the \"fourth estate\"--the literary\r\nprofession, and they journey into unexplored regions of thought to\r\ngive the omniverous modern reader something new to feed upon. The\r\ncensus of 1880 reports 445 women as authors and literary persons.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper itself, that great engine \"whose ambassadors are in\r\nevery quarter of the globe, whose couriers upon every road,\" has\r\nslowly swung round, and is at last headed in the right direction.\r\nReporters for the daily press in Massachusetts no longer write in a\r\nspirit of flippancy or contempt, and there is not an editor in the\r\nState of any account who would permit a member of his staff to\r\nreport a woman's meeting in any other spirit than that of courtesy.\r\nTeachers occupying high positions and presidents of colleges have\r\ngiven pronounced opinions in favor of the reform. Said President\r\nHopkins of Williams College, in 1875:\r\n\r\n     I would at this point correct my teaching in \"The Law of Love,\"\r\n     to the effect that _home_ is peculiarly the sphere of woman, and\r\n     civil government that of man. I now regard the home as the joint\r\n     sphere of man _and_ woman, and the sphere of civil government\r\n     more of an open question between the two.\r\n\r\nThe New England Women's Club, parent[152] of the modern clubs and\r\nassociations for the advancement of women, has been one of the\r\nfactors in the woman's rights movement. Its members have, in their\r\nwork and in their lives, illustrated the doctrine of woman's\r\nequality with man. It was formed in February, 1868.[153]\r\n\r\nThere has never been, from time immemorial, much difference of\r\nopinion concerning woman's right to do a good share in the\r\n_drudgery_ of the world. But in the remunerative employments,\r\nbefore 1850, she was but sparsely represented. In 1840, when\r\nHarriet Martineau visited this country, she found to her surprise\r\nthat there were only seven vocations, outside home, into which the\r\nwomen of the United States had entered. These were \"teaching,\r\nneedlework, keeping boarders, weaving, type-setting, and folding\r\nand stitching in book-bindery.\" In contrast, it is only necessary\r\nto mention that in Massachusetts alone, woman's ingenuity is now\r\nemployed in nearly 300 different branches of industry. It cannot be\r\nadded that for doing the same kind and amount of work women are\r\npaid men's wages. The census does not include the services of the\r\nmother and daughter among the _paid_ vocations, though, as is well\r\nknown, in many instances they do all the housework of the family.\r\nThey get no wages, and therefore do not appear among the\r\n\"useful classes.\" They are not earners, but savers of money. A\r\nmoney-_saver_ is not a recognized factor, either in political\r\neconomy or in the State census. The mother, daughter or wife is put\r\ndown in its pages as \"keeping house.\" If they were paid for their\r\nservices they would be called \"housekeepers,\" and would have their\r\nplace among the paid employments.\r\n\r\nAmong the many rights woman has appropriated to herself must be\r\nincluded the \"patent right.\" The charge has often been made that\r\nwomen never invent anything, but statistics on the subject declare\r\nthat in 1880 patents for their own inventions were issued to\r\neighty-seven different women in the United States. A fair\r\nproportion of these were from Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThis progress in the various departments encountered great\r\nopposition from certain teachers and writers. Dr. Bushnell's\r\n\"Reform Against Nature,\" Dr. Fulton's talk both in and out of the\r\npulpit, served to show the weakness of that side of the question.\r\nFrances Parkman, Dr. Holland, Dr. W. H. Hammond, Rev. Morgan Dix,\r\nand even some women have added their so-called arguments in the\r\nvain attempt to keep woman as they think \"God made her.\"\r\n\r\nMuch the stronger writers and speakers have been found on the right\r\nside of this question. The names of leading speakers, such as\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips and Theodore Parker, have\r\nalready been mentioned. Perhaps the most suggestive articles in\r\nfavor of the reform were T. W. Higginson's \"Ought Women to Learn\r\nthe Alphabet,\" published in the _Atlantic Monthly_ of February,\r\n1859, and Samuel Bowles' \"The Woman Question and Sex in Politics,\"\r\npublished at a later date in the _Springfield Republican_.\r\n\"Warrington,\" in his letters to the same newspaper, from 1868 to\r\n1876, never failed to present a good and favorable argument on some\r\nphase of the woman question. Caroline Healey Dall's lectures before\r\n1860, and her book \"The College, the Market and the Court,\"\r\npublished in 1868, were seed-grain sown in the field of this\r\nreform. Samuel E. Sewall's able digest of the laws relating to the\r\nlegal condition of married women, and William I. Bowditch's\r\nadmirable pamphlets,[154] have done incalculable service.\r\n\r\nOf women in the civil service, there are: 58 clerks, 266 employes\r\nand 387 officials--total, 411. This includes postmasters and clerks\r\nin bureaus. In 1880, General F. A. Walker, superintendent of the\r\ncensus, instructed the supervisors of the several districts to\r\nappoint women as enumerators when practicable. They were\r\naccordingly so appointed in many parts of the United States.\r\nCarroll D. Wright, supervisor of the district of Massachusetts was\r\nin favor of General Walker's instructions, and out of the 903\r\nenumerators appointed by him, thirty were women. This was an\r\nexceedingly large proportion compared with the number appointed in\r\nStates where supervisors were not in favor of women enumerators.\r\n\r\nThanks to the efforts of Caroline Healey Dall, the American Social\r\nScience Association, formed in 1865, put women on its board of\r\nofficers, as did the Boston Social Science Association, organized\r\nthe same year. These were the first large organizations in the\r\ncountry to admit women on an absolute equality with men. The result\r\nof this action vindicated at once and forever woman's fitness to\r\noccupy positions of honor in associations that man had hitherto\r\nclaimed for himself alone. This has encouraged women to express\r\nthemselves in the presence of the wisest men, and enabled them to\r\npresent to the public the woman side of some great questions. Women\r\nare officers as well as members of many societies originally\r\nestablished exclusively for men. A national society for political\r\neducation, formed in 1880, of which women are members, has at least\r\none woman on its board of officers. What would have been thought\r\nthirty years ago, if women had studied finance, banks and banking,\r\nmoney, currency, sociology and political science?\r\n\r\nThe Summer School of Philosophy at Concord was founded in\r\n1879.[155] A majority of the students are women, as was not the\r\ncase in the elder schools of philosophy, and they come from far and\r\nnear to spend a few weeks of their summer vacation in the enjoyment\r\nof this halcyon season of rest. Day after day they sit patiently on\r\nthe aesthetic benches of the Hillside chapel and bask in the calm\r\nlight of mild philosophy. Its seed was sown forty years ago, in\r\nwhat was called the Transcendental movement in New England. The\r\nConcord school finds in Mr. Sanborn its executive spirit, without\r\nwhich it could no more have come into existence at this time than\r\nits first seed could have been planted forty years ago, without the\r\nconceptive thought of Mr. Emerson, Mr. Alcott and Margaret Fuller.\r\n\r\nBoston University long ago offered the advantages of its law-school\r\nto women, but they do not much avail themselves of this privilege.\r\nLelia J. Robinson, in March, 1881, made her application for\r\nadmission to the bar. In presenting her claim before the court,\r\nApril 23, Mr. Charles R. Train admitted that it was a novel one;\r\nbut in a very effective manner he went on to state the cogent\r\nreasons why a woman who had carefully prepared herself for the\r\nprofession of the law should be permitted to practice in the\r\ncourts. At the close, Chief-Justice Gray gave the opinion,\r\ninformally, that the laws, as they now exist, preclude woman from\r\nbeing attorney-at-law; but he reserved the matter for the\r\nconsideration of the full bench. The Supreme Judicial Court\r\nrendered an adverse decision. Petitions were then sent to the\r\nlegislature of 1882, and that body passed an act[156] declaring\r\nthat, \"The provisions of law relating to the qualification and\r\nadmission to practice of attorneys-at-law shall apply to women.\"\r\nThe petition of Lelia Josephine Robinson to the Supreme Court was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     1. The best administration of justice may be most safely secured\r\n     by allowing the representation of all classes of the people in\r\n     courts of justice.\r\n\r\n     2. To allow women to practice at the bar as attorneys is only to\r\n     secure to the people the right to select their own counsel. It is\r\n     to give the women of Massachusetts the opportunity of consulting\r\n     members of their own sex for that advice and assistance which\r\n     none but authorized attorneys and counsellors are legally\r\n     qualified to give.\r\n\r\n     3. To exclude women from the bar would be to do an injustice to\r\n     the community, in preventing free and wholesome competition of\r\n     existing talent, and to do still greater injustice to those women\r\n     who are qualified for the profession, by shutting them out from\r\n     an honorable and remunerative means of gaining a livelihood.\r\n\r\n     4. To exclude women from the bar because there are certain\r\n     departments of the profession which are peculiarly ill-adapted to\r\n     their sex and nature, would be to assume arbitrarily that, with\r\n     entire lack of judgment or discretion, modesty or policy, they\r\n     would seek or accept such business; and to close to them those\r\n     avenues of the profession for which they are generally admitted\r\n     to be eminently well adapted, for such a reason, and upon such an\r\n     assumption, would be so grossly unjust that no argument can be\r\n     based on such an impossible contingency.\r\n\r\n     Your applicant, having faithfully and diligently pursued the\r\n     study of law for three years, being a graduate of the Boston\r\n     University Law School, and having complied with the other\r\n     requirements of the statute and the rules of court upon the\r\n     subject, respectfully prays that her petition for examination,\r\n     which was duly filed, may be favorably considered, and that it be\r\n     included in the general notice to the Board of Examiners of\r\n     Suffolk county. LELIA JOSEPHINE ROBINSON.\r\n\r\nThe opinion given by the Supreme Judicial Court, so far as it\r\nrelates to the main point at issue, is as follows:\r\n\r\n     The question presented by this petition and by the report on\r\n     which it has been reserved for our determination, is whether,\r\n     under the laws of the commonwealth, an unmarried woman is\r\n     entitled to be examined for admission as an attorney and\r\n     counsellor of this Court. This being the first application of the\r\n     kind in Massachusetts, the Court, desirous that it might be fully\r\n     argued, informed the executive committee of the Bar Association\r\n     of the city of Boston of the application, and has received\r\n     elaborate briefs from the petitioner in support of her petition\r\n     and from two gentlemen of the bar as _amici curiae_ in opposition\r\n     thereto. The statute under which the application is made is as\r\n     follows: \"A citizen of this State, or an alien who has made the\r\n     primary declaration of his intention to become a citizen of the\r\n     United States, and who is an inhabitant of this State, at the age\r\n     of twenty-one years and of good moral character, may, on the\r\n     recommendation of an attorney, petition the Supreme Judicial or\r\n     Superior Court to be examined for admission as an attorney,\r\n     whereupon the Court shall assign a time and place for the\r\n     examination, and if satisfied with his acquirements and\r\n     qualifications he shall be admitted.\" St. 1876, c. 107.\r\n\r\n     The word \"citizen,\" when used in its most common and most\r\n     comprehensive sense, doubtless includes women; but a woman is\r\n     not, by virtue of her citizenship, vested by the Constitution of\r\n     the United States, or by the constitution of the commonwealth,\r\n     with any absolute right, independent of legislation, to take part\r\n     in the government, either as voter or as an officer, or to be\r\n     admitted to practice as an attorney. _Miuor vs. Happersett, 51\r\n     Wall. 162. Bradwell vs. Illinois, 16 Wall. 130._ The rule that\r\n     \"words importing the masculine gender maybe applied to females,\"\r\n     like all other general rules of construction of statutes, must\r\n     yield when such construction would be either \"repugnant to the\r\n     context of the same statute,\" or \"inconsistent with the manifest\r\n     intent of the legislature.\" Gen. Sts. c. 3, Sec. 7.\r\n\r\n     The only statute making any provisions concerning attorneys, that\r\n     mentions women, is the poor-debtor act, which, after enumerating\r\n     among the cases in which an arrest of the person may be made on\r\n     execution in an action of contract, that in which \"the debtor is\r\n     attorney-at-law,\" who has unreasonably neglected to pay to his\r\n     client money collected, enacts, in the next section but one,\r\n     \"that no woman shall be arrested on any civil process except for\r\n     tort.\" Gen. Sts. c. 124, Sec.Sec. 5, 7. If these provisions do not\r\n     imply that the legislature assumed that women should not be\r\n     attorneys, they certainly have no tendency to show that it\r\n     intended that they should. The word \"citizen,\" in the statute\r\n     under which this application is made, is but a repetition of the\r\n     word originally adopted with a view of excluding aliens, before\r\n     the statute of 1852, c. 154, allowed those aliens to be admitted\r\n     to the bar who had made the preliminary declaration of intention\r\n     to become citizens. Rev. Sts., c. 88, Sec. 19. Gen. Sts., c. 121, Sec.\r\n     28.\r\n\r\n     The reenactment of the act relating to the admission of attorneys\r\n     in the same words without more so far as relates to the personal\r\n     qualifications of the applicant, since other statutes have\r\n     expressly modified the legal rights and capacity of women in\r\n     other important respects, tends rather to refute than to advance\r\n     the theory that the legislature intended that these words should\r\n     comprehend women. No inference of an intention of the legislature\r\n     to include women in the statutes concerning the admission of\r\n     attorneys can be drawn from the mere omission of the word \"male.\"\r\n     The only statute to which we have referred, in which that word is\r\n     inserted, is the statute concerning the qualifications of voters\r\n     in town affairs, which, following the language of the article of\r\n     the constitution that defines the qualifications of voters for\r\n     governor, lieutenant-governor, senators and representatives,\r\n     speaks of \"every male citizen of twenty-one years of age,\" etc.\r\n     Gen. Sts. c. 18, Sec. 19. Const. Mass. Amendments, art. 3. Words\r\n     which taken by themselves would be equally applicable to women\r\n     and to men are constantly used in the constitution and statutes,\r\n     in speaking of offices which it could not be contended, in the\r\n     present state of law, that women were capable of holding.\r\n\r\n     The Courts of the commonwealth have not assumed by their rules to\r\n     admit to the bar any class of persons not within the apparent\r\n     intent of the legislature as manifested in the statutes. The word\r\n     \"persons,\" in the latest rule of Court upon the subject, was the\r\n     word used in the rule of 1810 and in the statutes of 1785 and\r\n     1836, at times when no one contemplated the possibility of a\r\n     woman's being admitted to practice as an attorney. 121 Mass. 600.\r\n     6.

The United States Court of Claims, at December term,\r\n     1873, on full consideration, denied an application of a woman to\r\n     be admitted to practice as an attorney upon the ground \"that\r\n     under the constitution and laws of the United States a Court is\r\n     without power to grant such an application, and that a woman is\r\n     without legal capacity to take the office of an attorney.\"\r\n     _Lockwood's Case, 9 Ct. of Claims, 346, 356._ At October terms\r\n     1876 of the Supreme Court of the United States, the same\r\n     petitioner applied to be admitted to practice as an attorney and\r\n     counsellor of that Court, and her application was denied.\r\n\r\n     The decision has not been officially reported, but upon the\r\n     record of the Court, of which we have an authentic copy, it is\r\n     thus stated: \"Upon the presentation of this application, the\r\n     chief-justice said that notice of this application having been\r\n     previously brought to his attention, he had been instructed by\r\n     the Court to announce the following decision upon it: By the\r\n     uniform practice of the Court from its organization to the\r\n     present time, and by the fair construction of its rules, none but\r\n     men are permitted to practice before it as attorneys and\r\n     counsellors. This is in accordance with immemorial usages in\r\n     England, and the law and the practice in all the States until\r\n     within a recent period, and the Court does not feel called upon\r\n     to make a change until such change is required by statute or a\r\n     more extended practice in the highest Courts of the States.\" The\r\n     subsequent act of congress of February 15, 1879, enables only\r\n     those women to be admitted to practice before the Supreme Court\r\n     of the United States who have been for three years members of the\r\n     bar of the highest Court of a State or territory, or of the\r\n     Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n     The conclusion that women cannot be admitted to the bar under the\r\n     existing statutes of the commonwealth is in accordance with\r\n     judgments of the highest Courts of the States of Illinois and\r\n     Wisconsin. _Bradwell's Case, 55 Ill., 525. Goodell's Case, 39\r\n     Wis., 232._ The suggestion in the brief of the petitioner that\r\n     women have been admitted in other States can have no weight here,\r\n     in the absence of all evidence that (except under clear\r\n     affirmative words in a statute) they have ever been so admitted\r\n     upon deliberate consideration of the question involved, or by a\r\n     Court whose decisions are authoritative.\r\n\r\n     It is hardly necessary to add that our duty is limited to\r\n     declaring the law as it is, and that whether any change in that\r\n     law would be wise or expedient is a question for the legislative\r\n     and not for the judicial department of the government.\r\n\r\n     Petition dismissed.

LORD,\r\n                 CHARLES ALLEN,        WALBRIDGE A. FIELD.\r\n\r\nThe three preceding decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court of\r\nMassachusetts against the rights of the women of the commonwealth\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\nThe first decision was in the case of Sarah E. Wall of Worcester,\r\nwho had refused to pay her taxes under the following protest:\r\n\r\n     Believing with the immortal Declaration of Independence that\r\n     taxation and representation are inseparable; believing that the\r\n     constitution of the State furnishes no authority for the taxation\r\n     of woman; believing also that the constitution of the higher law\r\n     of God, written on the human soul, requires us, if we would be\r\n     worthy the rich inheritance of the past and true to ourselves and\r\n     the future, to yield obedience to no statute that shall tend to\r\n     fetter its aspirations, I shall henceforth pay no taxes until the\r\n     word _male_ is stricken from the voting clauses of the\r\n     constitution of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n     Worcester _Daily Spy_, October 5, 1858.            SARAH E. WALL.\r\n\r\nMiss Wall was prosecuted by the city collector, and she carried her\r\ncase before the Supreme Court, where she appeared for herself, W.\r\nA. Williams appearing for the collector. In an account of this\r\nmatter in 1881, Miss Wall says: \"Although it was in 1858 that my\r\nresistance to taxation commenced, it was not until 1863 that the\r\ncontest terminated and the decision was rendered. I think the\r\nSupreme Court would always find some way to evade a decision on\r\nthis question.\"\r\n\r\n     _Wheeler vs. Wall, 6 Allen, 558_: By the constitution of\r\n     Massachusetts, c. 1, Sec. 1, article 4, the legislature has power to\r\n     impose taxes upon all the inhabitants of and persons resident,\r\n     and estates lying within the said commonwealth. By the laws\r\n     passed by the legislature in pursuance of this power and\r\n     authority, the defendant is liable to taxation, although she is\r\n     not qualified to vote for the officers by whom the taxes were\r\n     assessed. The Court, acting under the constitution, and bound to\r\n     support it and maintain its provisions faithfully, cannot declare\r\n     null and void a statute which has been passed by the legislature,\r\n     in pursuance of an express authority conferred by the\r\n     constitution.--[Opinion by the chief-justice, George Tyler\r\n     Bigelow.\r\n\r\nThe second decision on the will of Francis Jackson is copied\r\n_verbatim_ from _Allen's Reports_:\r\n\r\n     _Jackson vs. Phillips and others, 14 Allen, 539_: A bequest to\r\n     trustees, to be expended at their discretion, * * * * \"to secure\r\n     the passage of laws granting whether women, married or unmarried,\r\n     the right to vote, to hold office, to hold, manage and devise\r\n     property, and all other civil rights enjoyed by men,\" is not a\r\n     charity.\r\n\r\n     _Bill in equity by the executor of the will of Francis Jackson of\r\n     Boston, for instructions as to the validity and effect of the\r\n     following bequests and devises:_\r\n\r\n     Art. 6th. \"I give and bequeath to Wendell Phillips of said\r\n     Boston, Lucy Stone, formerly of Brookfield, Mass., now the wife\r\n     of Henry Blackwell of New York, and Susan B. Anthony of\r\n     Rochester, N. Y., their successors and assigns, $5,000, not for\r\n     their own use, but in trust, nevertheless, to be expended by them\r\n     without any responsibility to any one, at their discretion, in\r\n     such sums, at such times and in such places as they may deem fit,\r\n     to secure the passage of laws granting women, whether married or\r\n     unmarried, the right to vote, to hold office, to hold, manage and\r\n     devise property, and all other civil rights enjoyed by men; and\r\n     for the preparation and circulation of books, the delivery of\r\n     lectures, and such other means as they may judge best; and I\r\n     hereby constitute them a board of trustees for that intent and\r\n     purpose, with power to add two other persons to said board if\r\n     they deem it expedient. And I hereby appoint Wendell Phillips\r\n     president and treasurer, and Susan B. Anthony secretary of said\r\n     board. I direct the treasurer of said board not to loan any part\r\n     of said bequest, but to invest, and, if need be, sell and\r\n     reinvest the same in bank or railroad shares, at his discretion.\r\n     I further authorize and request said board of trustees, the\r\n     survivor and survivors of them, to fill any and all vacancies\r\n     that may occur from time to time by death or resignation of any\r\n     member or any officer of said board. One other bequest,\r\n     hereinafter made, will, sooner or later, revert to this board of\r\n     trustees. My desire is that they may become a permanent\r\n     organization, until the rights of women shall be established\r\n     equal with those of men; and I hope and trust that said board\r\n     will receive the services and sympathy, the donations and\r\n     bequests, of the friends of human rights. And being desirous that\r\n     said board should have the immediate benefit of said bequest,\r\n     without waiting for my exit, I have already paid it in advance\r\n     and in full to said Phillips, the treasurer of said board, whose\r\n     receipt therefor is on my files.\"\r\n\r\n     OPINION.--Gray, J. IV. It is quite clear that the bequest in\r\n     trust to be expended \"to secure the passage of laws granting\r\n     women, whether married or unmarried, the right to vote, to hold\r\n     office, to hold, manage and devise property, and all other civil\r\n     rights enjoyed by men,\" cannot be sustained as a charity. No\r\n     precedent has been cited in its support. This bequest differs\r\n     from the others, in aiming directly and exclusively to change the\r\n     laws; and its object cannot be accomplished without changing the\r\n     constitution also. Whether such an alteration of the existing\r\n     laws and frame of government would be wise and desirable, is a\r\n     question upon which we cannot, sitting in a judicial capacity,\r\n     properly express any opinion. Our duty is limited to expounding\r\n     the laws as they stand. And those laws do not recognize the\r\n     purpose of overthrowing or changing them, in whole or in part, as\r\n     a charitable use. This bequest, therefore, not being for a\r\n     charitable purpose, nor for the benefit of any particular\r\n     persons, and being unrestricted in point of time, is inoperative\r\n     and void. For the same reason, the gift to the same object, of\r\n     one-third of the residue of the testator's estate after the death\r\n     of his daughter, Mrs. Eddy, and her daughter, Mrs. Bacon, is also\r\n     invalid, and will go to his heirs-at-law as a resulting trust.\r\n\r\nDecision third was on the right of women to hold judicial offices.\r\nTo quote again from _Allen's Reports_:\r\n\r\n     On June 8, 1871, the following order was passed by the governor\r\n     and council, and on June 10 transmitted to the Justices of the\r\n     Supreme Judicial Court, who, on June 29, returned the reply which\r\n     is annexed. _Ordered_, That the opinion of the Supreme Judicial\r\n     Court be requested as to the following questions: _First_--Under\r\n     the constitution of this commonwealth, can a woman, if duly\r\n     appointed and qualified as a justice of the peace, legally\r\n     perform all acts appertaining to that office? _Second_--Under the\r\n     laws of this commonwealth, would oaths and acknowledgments of\r\n     deeds, taken before a married or unmarried woman duly appointed\r\n     and qualified as a justice of the peace, be legal and valid?\r\n\r\n     OPINION.--By the constitution of the commonwealth, the office of\r\n     justice of the peace is a judicial office, and must be exercised\r\n     by the officer in person, and a woman, whether married or\r\n     unmarried, cannot be appointed to such an office. The law of\r\n     Massachusetts at the time of the adoption of the constitution,\r\n     the whole frame and purport of the instrument itself, and the\r\n     universal understanding and unbroken practical construction for\r\n     the greater part of a century afterwards, all support this\r\n     conclusion, and are inconsistent with any other. It follows that,\r\n     if a woman should be formally appointed and commissioned as a\r\n     justice of the peace, she would have no constitutional or legal\r\n     authority to exercise any of the functions appertaining to that\r\n     office. Each of the questions proposed must, therefore, be\r\n     respectfully answered in the negative.\r\n\r\n     [Signed:]    REUBEN A.

Wendell Phillips told me that he drew up this will, and that\r\nits provisions were so carefully worded, that even the Supreme\r\nCourt could find no flaw in it. It is in his own hand-writing, and\r\nChandler R. Ransom was the executor. Eliza F. Eddy was the daughter\r\nof Francis Jackson, and just before her death in 1882, desiring to\r\nhelp the suffrage cause and thus carry out her father's intentions,\r\nshe made her will in which she bequeathed $40,000 for this purpose.\r\nThe clause relating to this bequest is as follows:\r\n\r\n     Whatever is left, after paying the above legacies, I direct shall\r\n     be divided into equal portions. One of said portions I leave to\r\n     Susan B. Anthony of Rochester, N. Y.; and the other portion I\r\n     leave to Lucy Stone, wife of Henry B. Blackwell, as her own\r\n     absolute separate property, free from any control by him. I\r\n     request said Susan and Lucy to use said fund thus given to\r\n     further what is called the \"Woman's Rights' Cause\"; but neither\r\n     of them is under any legal responsibility to any one or any court\r\n     to do so.\r\n\r\nHer will was filed and the Probate Court declared its validity.\r\nThis decision was appealed from for several unimportant reasons by\r\nrelatives of Mrs. Eddy, Francis W. and Jerome A. Bacon, minors; and\r\nthe case was carried to the Supreme Judicial Court. After many\r\ndelays it was finally decided in favor of the validity of the will,\r\nMarch, 1885, R. M. Morse, jr., and S. J. Elder for the plaintiff,\r\nand B. F. Butler and F. L. Washburn for the defendants. The court's\r\nfinal decision, rendered by Hon. Charles Devens, is as follows:\r\n\r\n     ALBERT F. BACON and others, executors and others _vs._ CHANDLER\r\n     R. RANSOM, executor, and others.\r\n\r\n     Suffolk. March 18, 19, 1885. W.

Blackwell, Susan B.\r\n     Anthony, and other legatees thereunder, and the attorney-general,\r\n     to compel the executor of said Eddy's will to pay over to the\r\n     plaintiffs the residue of her estate. The bill alleged the\r\n     following facts:\r\n\r\n     Francis Jackson, the father of said Eliza F. Eddy, died in 1861,\r\n     leaving a will, by the sixth article of which he gave $5,000 to\r\n     Wendell Phillips, Lucy Stone Blackwell and Susan B. Anthony, in\r\n     trust, \"to be expended by them without any responsibility to any\r\n     one, at their discretion, in such sums, at such times, and in\r\n     such places as they may deem fit, to secure the passage of laws\r\n     granting women, whether married or unmarried, the right to vote,\r\n     to hold office, to hold, manage and devise property, and all\r\n     other civil rights enjoyed by men; and for the preparation and\r\n     circulation of books, the delivery of lectures, and such other\r\n     means as they may judge best.\" By the eighth article he gave\r\n     one-third of the residue to a trustee, to pay the income to his\r\n     daughter, Eliza F. Eddy, during her life, and upon her death\r\n     one-half of the income to the trustees and on the trusts named in\r\n     the sixth article, and the other half to Mrs. Eddy's daughter,\r\n     Mrs. Lizzie F. Bacon, during her life, and, on the death of Mrs.\r\n     Bacon, the principal to the trustees and on the trusts named in\r\n     the sixth article.\r\n\r\n     It was held by this court that these bequests were not a charity\r\n     (see _Jackson vs. Phillips, 14 Allen, 539_).\r\n\r\n     In consequence of this decision, certain agreements, releases,\r\n     and a partition were made, by which one-third of the residue of\r\n     Mr. Jackson's estate became the property of Mrs. Eddy, subject to\r\n     being held in trust for herself for life, and thereafter, as to\r\n     one-half, for her daughter, Mrs. Bacon, during her life. Mrs.\r\n     Eddy died December 29, 1881, leaving a will by which she gave\r\n     absolute legacies to the amount of $24,500 to various persons\r\n     therein named. This disposed of all her estate except what came\r\n     to her from her father's estate. Her will then provided as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n     \"What is left, after paying the above legacies, I direct shall be\r\n     divided into two equal portions; one of said portions I leave to\r\n     Miss Susan B. Anthony of Rochester, in the State of New York, as\r\n     her absolute property, and the other portion I leave to Lucy\r\n     Stone, wife of H. B. Blackwell, as her own absolute and separate\r\n     property, free from any control of him. I request said Susan and\r\n     Lucy to use said fund thus given to further what is called the\r\n     woman's rights cause; but neither of them is under any legal\r\n     responsibility to any one or any court to do so.\"\r\n\r\n     The will further alleged that this residue was substantially the\r\n     estate received from Francis Jackson; that the will was intended\r\n     by the testatrix to defeat the decision of this court, before\r\n     mentioned; that the testatrix had no personal acquaintance with\r\n     Lucy Stone or Susan B. Anthony; that said gift was intended as a\r\n     gift _in perpetuam_ to the said cause, and was, without limit of\r\n     time, upon trust in favor of said cause; and that said cause was\r\n     not a charity within the meaning of the law, and was null and\r\n     void.\r\n\r\n     The defendants demurred to the bill for want of equity. The case\r\n     was heard by C. Allen, _J._, on the bill and demurrer, and a\r\n     decree was entered sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the\r\n     bill. The plaintiffs appealed to the full court.\r\n\r\n     R. M. MORSE, Jr., and S. J. ELDER, for the plaintiffs.\r\n\r\n     B. F. BUTLER and F. L. WASHBURN, for the defendants.\r\n\r\n     Judge CHARLES DEVENS. The fact that the respective portions of\r\n     the estate bequeathed by Mrs. Eddy to Mrs. Stone and Miss Anthony\r\n     were in amount equal to-or precisely the same as those which came\r\n     to her by descent from her father, Francis Jackson, is not of\r\n     importance in the case at bar. It had been held in _Jackson vs.\r\n     Phillips, 14 Allen, 539_, that a certain bequest made by Mr.\r\n     Jackson in trust was not, legally speaking, a public charity, and\r\n     that it could not therefore pass to the beneficiaries named in\r\n     his will. The property which he thus attempted to bequeath\r\n     descended therefore to his legal representatives, of whom Mrs.\r\n     Eddy was one. She received it with the same right to deal with it\r\n     or dispose of it in her lifetime, or by will at her decease, that\r\n     she had in any other estate which was her lawful property.\r\n\r\n     The bill alleges \"that said will was intended by the testatrix to\r\n     defeat the decision of the court, before mentioned; that the\r\n     testatrix had no personal acquaintance with Lucy Stone or Susan\r\n     B. Anthony; that said gift was intended as a gift _in perpetuam_\r\n     to the said cause.\" But if Mrs. Eddy has complied with the rules\r\n     of law in the disposition of her property, even if she has hoped\r\n     thereby to attain the same object as that desired by her father,\r\n     the decision referred to is not defeated, but is recognized and\r\n     conformed to; and, whatever her intention may have been, her\r\n     bequest is to be upheld.\r\n\r\n     Her gift to her beneficiaries is absolute in terms. They may do\r\n     what they will with the property bequeathed to them, as they may\r\n     with any other property which is lawfully their own. It is true\r\n     that the gift is accompanied by a request that they will use the\r\n     fund bequeathed \"to further what is called the woman's rights\r\n     cause.\" A request made by one who has the right to direct is\r\n     often, perhaps generally, interpreted as a command. For this\r\n     reason, recommendatory or precatory words used in a bequest are\r\n     frequently treated as an express direction. Thus, if a legacy\r\n     were given to A., with a request that out of the sum bequeathed\r\n     he would pay to another a certain sum, or a portion thereof, it\r\n     might well be construed as a legacy, to the amount named, to such\r\n     person. The expression of the desire of the testator would be the\r\n     expression of his will, and the words in form recommendatory\r\n     would be held to be mandatory and imperative. Where such words\r\n     are used, it is therefore a question of the fair construction to\r\n     be attributed to them (_Whipple vs. Adams, 1 Met., 444; Warner\r\n     vs. Bates, 98 Mass., 274; Spooner vs. Lovejoy, 108 Mass., 529_).\r\n\r\n     But the testatrix in the case at bar has left nothing to\r\n     construction. Apparently aware that a request, where she had a\r\n     right to direct, might be treated as a command, and desirous to\r\n     make it entirely clear that no restraint or duty in any legal\r\n     sense was imposed upon her legatees, and that the request of the\r\n     will was such in the limited sense of the word only, and in no\r\n     respect mandatory, she adds thereto, referring to the legatees,\r\n     \"But neither of them is under any legal responsibility to any one\r\n     or to any court to do so.\" Each of the legatees is therefore the\r\n     sole judge of whether she will follow, or how far or in what way\r\n     she will follow, the suggestion of the testatrix in the\r\n     disposition of the estate absolutely bequeathed to her. It is a\r\n     matter in which she is to be guided only by her judgment and\r\n     conscience, and no trust is imposed upon the property she\r\n     receives.\r\n\r\n     As no trust is created, it would be superfluous to consider\r\n     whether, if the request of the testatrix were treated as a\r\n     command, one would then be indicated capable of enforcement\r\n     according to the rules of law.\r\n\r\n     _Bill dismissed._    [Signed:]   MARCUS MORTON, _Chief-Justice_,\r\n\r\n         WALBRIDGE ABNER FIELD,     CHARLES DEVENS,\r\n         WILLIAM ALLEN,             CHARLES ALLEN,\r\n         WALDO COBURN,              OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES, Jr.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom these decisions our daughters should learn the importance of\r\nhaving some knowledge of law. Had not Mrs. Eddy learned from\r\nexperience in her father's case that property could not be left in\r\ntrust to any societies except those called religious and\r\ncharitable, and made her bequest absolutely to persons, the gift of\r\n$56,000 would have been lost to the woman suffrage movement. As it\r\nwas, nearly $10,000 was swallowed up in litigation to secure what\r\nthe donees did finally obtain. Considering that Mrs. Eddy[157] is\r\nthe only woman who has ever had both the desire and the power to\r\nmake a large bequest to this cause, its friends have great reason\r\nto rejoice in her wisdom as well as her generosity.\r\n\r\nCivilization would have been immeasurably farther advanced than it\r\nnow is, had the many rich women, who have left large bequests to\r\nchurches, and colleges for boys, concentrated their wealth and\r\ninfluence on the education, elevation and enfranchisement of their\r\nown sex. We trust that Mrs. Eddy's example may not be lost on the\r\ncoming generation of women.--[EDITORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[104] For details of early history see vol. I., chap. viii. See\r\nalso \"Massachusetts in the Woman Suffrage Movement,\" Roberts Bros.,\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\n[105] As an original question, no friend of woman suffrage can deny\r\nthat it was a mean thing to put the word \"male\" into the fourteenth\r\namendment. It was, doubtless, wise to adopt that amendment. It was\r\nan extension of the right of suffrage, and so far in the line of\r\nAmerican progress, yet it was also an implied denial of the\r\nsuffrage to women.--[Warrington in the _Springfield Republican_.\r\n\r\n[106] See Vol. II., page 178.\r\n\r\n[107] John Neal came from Maine; Nathaniel and Armenia White from\r\nNew Hampshire; Isabella Hooker from Connecticut; Thomas W.\r\nHigginson from Rhode Island; and John G.

There was at that time\r\nno organization in the State, and there had been no revival of the\r\nsubject in the minds of the people since the war, which had\r\nswallowed up every other interest. In the spring of 1868, I wrote\r\nto Abby Kelley Foster, telling her my wish to have something done\r\nin our own State, and she advised me to call together a few persons\r\nknown to be in favor of suffrage, some day during anniversary week,\r\nin some parlor in Boston. I corresponded with Adin Ballou, E. D.\r\nDraper, and others, on the subject, and talked the matter over with\r\nProf. T. T. Leonard, teacher of elocution, who offered his hall for\r\na place of meeting. I wrote a notice inviting all persons\r\ninterested in woman suffrage to come to Mr. Leonard's hall, on a\r\ncertain day and hour. At the time appointed the hall was full of\r\npeople. I opened the meeting, and stated why I had called it;\r\nothers took up the theme, and we had a lively meeting. All agreed\r\nthat something should be done, and a committee of seven was\r\nappointed to call a convention for the purpose of organizing a\r\nwoman suffrage association. Caroline M. Severance, Stephen S.\r\nFoster, Sarah Southwick and myself, were of this committee. We held\r\na number of meetings and finally decided to call a convention early\r\nin the autumn of 1868. This convention was held in Horticultural\r\nHall, and the result was the organization of the New England Woman\r\nSuffrage Association.\"\r\n\r\n[109] _President_, Julia Ward Howe; _Vice-presidents_, William\r\nLloyd Garrison, Boston; Paulina W.

Bowles, F. B. Sanborn, W. S. Robinson,\r\nGilbert Haven and many others.\r\n\r\n[124] In the records of the executive meetings of this Association\r\nI find the following votes. In October, 1872, it was voted, That\r\nany invitation to speak at Republican meetings, extended to our\r\nagents by Republican committees in this State, be accepted by them\r\nuntil the coming election, their usual salaries being paid by this\r\nAssociation; that Miss Loud be notified by Lucy Stone of our\r\narrangement in regard to Republican meetings, and be requested,\r\nafter the 15th instant, to hold her meetings in that manner as far\r\nas practicable; that the balance of expenses of the woman's meeting\r\nheld at Tremont Temple be paid by this Association. [This was a\r\npolitical meeting held by the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation to endorse General Grant as the presidential candidate\r\nof the Republican party.]\r\n\r\n[125] The National Association of Massachusetts at its executive\r\nsession, August 23, passed the following:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That while we respect the advice of our leaders, as\r\n     their private political opinion, we deem it worse than useless to\r\n     \"stand by the Republican\" or any other party while we are\r\n     deprived of the only means of enforcing a political opinion; and\r\n     that we advise all associations, to concentrate their efforts\r\n     upon securing the ballot to women, withholding all attempt at\r\n     political influence until they possess the right which alone can\r\n     make their influence effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n[126] At the executive meeting of the New England Association, May,\r\n1874, it was voted that a circular be sent to the friends of woman\r\nsuffrage, requesting them to meet in Boston, May 25, to consider\r\nthe expediency of calling a convention to form a political party\r\nfor woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n[127] The call for this convention was signed by Harriet H.\r\nRobinson, Rev. A. D. Sargent, Rev. G. H. Vibbert, William Johnson,\r\nMrs. T. R. Woodman, Helen Gale and Mrs. M. Slocum. Judge Robert C.\r\nPitman was the candidate for governor.\r\n\r\n[128] This \"Woman Suffrage ticket,\" the first ever offered to a\r\nMassachusetts voter, received 41 votes out of the 1,340 cast in all\r\nby the voters of the town, a larger proportion than that first cast\r\nby the old Liberty party in Massachusetts, which began with only\r\n307 votes in the whole State, and ended in the Free Soil and\r\nRepublican parties.\r\n\r\n[129] Election day dawned and it rained hard, but the women braved\r\nthe storm. There they stood from 9 o'clock A.M. till a quarter of 5\r\nP.M. and distributed votes, only leaving their positions long\r\nenough to get a cup of coffee and a luncheon, which was provided at\r\nthe headquarters. They distributed 1,700 woman suffrage ballots and\r\n1,000 circulars containing arguments on the rights of women. They\r\nwere treated with unexceptionable politeness and kindness by the\r\nvoters.\r\n\r\n[130] The first time women went to the polls in Massachusetts was\r\nin 1870, when forty-two women of Hyde Park, led by Angelina Grimke\r\nWeld and Sarah Grimke, deposited their ballots, in solemn protest\r\n\"against the political ostracism of women, against leaving every\r\nvital interest of a majority of the citizens to the monopoly of a\r\nmale minority.\" It is hardly needful to record that these ballots\r\nwere not counted.\r\n\r\n[131] For summary of voting laws relating to women from 1691 to\r\n1822, see \"Massachusetts in the Woman Suffrage Movement,\" by\r\nHarriet H. Robinson: Roberts Brothers, Boston.\r\n\r\n[132] Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Lucy Stone, Theodore Parker,\r\nWendell Phillips, and other speakers of ability, presented able\r\narguments in favor of giving women the right to vote.\r\n\r\n[133] This memorial was printed by order of the legislature (Leg.\r\nDoc. Ho. 57) and is called \"Memorial of the Female Signers of the\r\nSeveral Petitions of Henry A. Hardy and Others,\" presented March 1,\r\n1849. The document is not signed and Mrs. Ferrin's name is not\r\nfound with it upon the records, neither does her name appear in the\r\njournal of the House in connection with any of the petitions and\r\naddresses she caused to be presented to the legislature of the\r\nState. But for the loyal friendship of the few who knew of her work\r\nand were willing to give her due credit, the name of Mary Upton\r\nFerrin [see Vol. I., page 208] and the memory of her labors as well\r\nas those of many another silent worker, would have gone into the\r\n\"great darkness.\"\r\n\r\n[134] The committee was addressed by Wendell Phillips, Julia Ward\r\nHowe, Lucy Stone, Rev. James Freeman Clarke and Hon. George F.\r\nHoar.\r\n\r\n[135] Two years before (1869), while sitting as visitor in the\r\ngallery of the House of Representatives, I heard the whole subject\r\nof woman's rights referred to the (bogus) committee on graveyards!\r\n\r\n[136] It was perhaps intended to serve as a means of reinstating\r\nAbby W. May and other women who had been defeated as candidates for\r\nreelection on the Boston school-board. The names of Isa E. Gray,\r\nMrs. C. B. Richmond, Elizabeth P. Peabody and John M. Forbes led\r\nthe lists of petitioners.\r\n\r\n[137] At the first annual election for school committees in cities\r\nand towns in 1879-80, about 5,000 women became registered voters.\r\n\r\n[138] Lucretia P. Hale, Abby W. May, Lucia M. Peabody, Mary J. S.\r\nBlake, Kate G. Wells, Lucretia Crocker.\r\n\r\n[139] This act, so brief and so _expressive_, is worthy to be\r\nremembered. It simply reads: \"_Be it enacted, etc., as follows_:\r\n\r\nSEC. 1. No person shall be deemed ineligible to serve upon a school\r\ncommittee by reason of sex.\r\n\r\nSEC. 2. This act shall take effect upon its passage. (_Approved\r\nJune 30, 1874._)\r\n\r\nBy force of habit, the legislature said not a word in the law about\r\n_women_. There are now (1885) 102 women members of school-boards in\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\n[140] See \"Women under the law of Massachusetts,\" Henry H. Sprague.\r\nBoston: W. B. Clarke & Carruth.\r\n\r\n[141] The authority for this old \"thumb\" tradition, that \"a man had\r\nthe right to whip his wife with a stick no bigger than his thumb,\"\r\nis found in an early edition of _Phillip's Evidence_. That book was\r\nauthority in English common law and in it Phillips is quoted as\r\nsaying, that according to the law of his day a husband \"might\r\nlawfully chastise his wife with a reasonable weapon, as a\r\n_broomstick_,\" adding, however, \"but if he use an unreasonable\r\nweapon, such as an iron bar, and death ensue, it would be\r\nmurder.\"--[Chamberlin, p. 818.\r\n\r\n[142] In an old will, made a hundred and fifty years ago, a husband\r\nof large means bequeathed to his \"dearly beloved wife\" $50 and a\r\nnew suit of clothes, with the injunction that she should return to\r\nher original, or family home. And with this small sum, as her share\r\nof his property, he returned her to her parents.\r\n\r\n[143] The little actual gain in votes since 1874, in favor of\r\nmunicipal or general suffrage for women, might cause the careless\r\nobserver to draw the inference that no great progress had been made\r\nin legislative sentiment during all these years. In 1870 the vote\r\nin the House of Representatives on the General Woman Suffrage Bill\r\nwas 133 to 68. In 1885 the bill giving municipal suffrage was\r\ndefeated in the House by a vote of 130 to 61. But this is not a\r\ntrue index of the progress of public opinion.\r\n\r\n[144] Mrs. Ellen M. Richards was the first woman who entered.\r\n\r\n[145] The Harvard Annex, so called, began its seventh year with\r\nsixty-five young ladies enrolled for study. The enrollment for the\r\npreceding six years was as follows: First year, 29: second, 47;\r\nthird 40; fourth, 39; fifth, 49, sixth, 55. Some of the students\r\ncome from distant places, but a majority are from the Cambridge and\r\nneighboring high-schools. The institution occupies this year for\r\nthe first time a building which has been conveniently arranged for\r\nits purposes. The endowment of the association which manages the\r\nwork now amounts to $85,000.\r\n\r\n[146] This lady was Lucy Downing, a sister of the first governor of\r\nMassachusetts. She was the wife of Emanuel Downing, a lawyer of the\r\nInner Temple, a friend of Governor Winthrop and afterward a man of\r\nmark in the infant colony. In a letter to her brother, Lucy Downing\r\nexpresses the desire of herself and husband to come to New England\r\nwith their children, but laments that if they do come her son\r\nGeorge cannot complete his studies. She says: \"You have yet noe\r\nsocieties nor means of that kind for the education of youths in\r\nlearning. It would make me goe far nimbler to New England, if God\r\nshould call me to it, than otherwise I should, and I believe a\r\ncolledge would put noe small life into the plantation.\" This letter\r\nwas written early in 1636, and in October of the same year the\r\nGeneral Court of the Massachusetts colony agreed to give L400\r\ntowards establishing a school or college in Newtowne (two years\r\nlater called Cambridge). Soon afterwards Rev. John Harvard died and\r\nleft one-half of his estate to this \"infant seminary,\" and in 1638\r\nit was ordered by the General Court that the \"Colledge to be built\r\nat Cambridge shall be called Harvard Colledge.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in 1638 Lucy Downing and her husband arrived in New England,\r\nand the name of George Downing stands second on the list of the\r\nfirst class of Harvard graduates in 1642. The Downings had other\r\nsons who do not seem to have been educated at Harvard, and\r\ndaughters who were put out to service. The son for whom so much was\r\ndone by his mother, was afterwards known as Sir George Downing, and\r\nhe became rich and powerful in England. Downing street in London is\r\nnamed for him. In after life he forgot his duty to his mother, who\r\nso naturally looked to him for support; and her last letter written\r\nfrom England after her husband died, when she was old and feeble,\r\ntells a sad story of her son's avarice and meanness, and leaves the\r\npainful impression that she suffered in her old age for the\r\nnecessaries of life.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to estimate how much influence the earnest longing of\r\nthis one woman for the better education of her son, had in the\r\nfounding of this earliest college in Massachusetts. But for her\r\nthinking and speaking at the right time the enterprise might have\r\nbeen delayed for half a century. It is to be deplored that Lucy\r\nDowning established the unwise precedent of educating one member of\r\nthe family at the expense of the rest; an example followed by too\r\nmany women since her time. Harvard College itself has followed it\r\nas well, in that it has so long excluded from its privileges that\r\nportion of the human family to which Lucy Downing belonged.\r\n\r\nAlthough women have never been permitted to become students of this\r\ncollege, or of any of the schools connected with it, yet they have\r\nalways taken a great interest in its pecuniary welfare, and the\r\nUniversity is largely indebted to the generosity of women for its\r\nendowment and support. From the records of Harvard College, it\r\nappears that funds have been contributed by 167 women, which\r\namount, in the aggregate, to $325,000. Out of these funds a\r\nproportion of the university scholarships were founded, and at\r\nleast one of its professors' chairs. In its Divinity school alone\r\nfive of the ten scholarships bear the names of women. Caroline A.\r\nPlummer of Salem gave $15,000 to found the Plummer Professorship of\r\nChristian Morals. Sarah Derby bequeathed $1,000 towards founding\r\nthe Hersey Professorship of Anatomy and Physic. The Holden Chapel\r\nwas built with money given for that purpose by Mrs. Samuel Holden\r\nand her daughters. Anna E. P. Sever, in 1879, left a legacy to this\r\ncollege of $140,000. [See Harvard Roll of Honor for women in\r\n_Harvard Register_ in 1880-81.] Other known benefactors of Harvard\r\nUniversity are: Lady Moulson, Hannah Sewall, Mary Saltonstall,\r\nDorothy Saltonstall, Joanna Alford, Mary P. Townsend, Ann Toppan,\r\nEliza Farrar, Ann F. Schaeffer, Levina Hoar, Rebecca A. Perkins,\r\nCaroline Merriam, Sarah Jackson, Hannah C. Andrews, Nancy Kendall,\r\nCharlotte Harris, Mary Osgood, Lucy Osgood, Sarah Winslow, Julia\r\nBullock, Marian Hovey, Anna Richmond, Caroline Richmond, Clara J.\r\nMoore and Susan Cabot.--[H. H. R.\r\n\r\nThe question is often asked, why are women so much more desirous\r\nthan men to see their children educated? Because it is a right that\r\nhas been denied to themselves. To them education means liberty,\r\nwealth, position, power. When the black race at the South were\r\nemancipated, they were far more eager for education than the poor\r\nwhites, and for the same reason.--[EDS.\r\n\r\n[147] Ruth Barnaby, aged 101 in 1875, Elizabeth Phillips and Hannah\r\nGreenway were also members of this branch of the profession. The\r\nlast was midwife to Mrs. Judge Sewall, who was the mother of\r\nnineteen children. Judge Samuel E. Sewall mentions this fact in his\r\ndiary, recently published.\r\n\r\n[148] Dr. Jackson had a large practice in Boston, and filled for\r\nfive years the chair of professor of diseases of children in the\r\nBoston University School of Medicine.\r\n\r\n[149] In 1840, a Massachusetts woman could not legally be treasurer\r\nof even a sewing society without having some man responsible for\r\nher. In 1809, it was necessary that the subscriptions of a married\r\nwoman for a newspaper or for charities should be in the name of her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n[150] Olympia Brown's own account of this transaction is as\r\nfollows: In 1864, soon after my settlement in Weymouth, I\r\nsolemnized a marriage. It was the first time a woman had officiated\r\nin this capacity, and there was so much talk about the legality of\r\nthe act, that I petitioned the legislature to take such action as\r\nwas necessary in order to make marriages solemnized by me legal.\r\nThe committee to whom it was referred reported that no legislation\r\nwas necessary.\r\n\r\n[151] This little book is worthy of mention, from the fact that it\r\nis probably the first publication of its kind in Massachusetts, if\r\nnot in America. The whole title of the book is, \"Observations on\r\nthe Rights of Women, with their appropriate duties agreeable to\r\nScripture, reason and common sense.\" Mrs. Crocker, in her\r\nintroduction, says: \"The wise author of Nature has endowed the\r\nfemale mind with equal powers and faculties, and given them the\r\nsame right of judging and acting for themselves as he gave the male\r\nsex.\" She further argues that, \"According to Scripture, woman was\r\nthe first to transgress and thus forfeited her original right of\r\nequality, and for a time was under the yoke of bondage, till the\r\nbirth of our blessed Savior, when she was restored to her equality\r\nwith man.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a very fine beginning, and would seem to savor strongly of\r\nthe modern woman's rights doctrine; but, unfortunately, the author,\r\nwith charming inconsistency, goes on to say,--\"We shall strictly\r\nadhere to the principle of the impropriety of females ever\r\ntrespassing on masculine grounds, as it is morally incorrect, and\r\nphysically impossible.\"\r\n\r\n[152] In 1836 there was a small woman's club of Lowell factory\r\noperatives, officered and managed entirely by women. This may be a\r\nremote first cause of the origin of the New England Women's Club,\r\nsince it bears the same relation to that flourishing institution,\r\nthat the native crab does to the grafted tree. This was the first\r\nwoman's club in the State, if not in the whole country.\r\n\r\n[153] A few ladies met at the house of Dr. Harriot K. Hunt to\r\nconsider a plan for organization. Its avowed object was \"to supply\r\nthe daily increasing need of a great central resting place, for the\r\ncomfort and convenience of those who may wish to unite with us, and\r\nultimately become a center for united and organized social thought\r\nand action.\" Its first president was Caroline M. Severance. On the\r\nexecutive board were the names of Julia Ward Howe, Ednah D. Cheney,\r\nLucy Goddard, Harriet M. Pitnam, Jane Alexander, Abby W. May, and\r\nmany others who have since become well known. This club held its\r\nfirst meetings in private houses, but it has for several years\r\noccupied spacious club rooms on Park street in Boston. Julia Ward\r\nHowe is its president. The club has its own historian, and when\r\nthis official gives the result of her researches to the public,\r\nthere will be seen how many projects for the elevation of women and\r\nthe improvement of social life have had their inception in the\r\nbrains of those who assemble in the parlors of the New England\r\nWoman's Club. In 1874, it projected the movement by which women\r\nwere first elected on the school committee of Boston, and also\r\nprepared the petition to be sent to the Massachusetts legislature\r\nof 1879, the result of which was the passage of the law allowing\r\nwomen to vote for school committees. In the _Woman's Journal_ for\r\n1883 will be found a sketch of this club.\r\n\r\n[154] \"Taxation of Women in Massachusetts\"; \"Woman Suffrage\r\na Right, not a Privilege,\" and \"The Forgotten Woman in\r\nMassachusetts.\"\r\n\r\n[155] Its projectors were A. Bronson Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson,\r\nProfessor W. T. Harris, Frank B. Sanborn, Professor Benjamin\r\nPierce, Dr. H. K. Jones, Elizabeth P. Peabody and Ednah D. Cheney.\r\n\r\n[156] This act is almost as brief as a certain clause in one of the\r\nelection laws of the State of Texas, which says: \"The masculine\r\ngender shall include the feminine and neuter.\"\r\n\r\n[157] We deeply regret that we have been unable to procure a good\r\nphotograph of our generous benefactor, as it was our intention to\r\nmake her engraving the frontispiece of this volume, and thus give\r\nthe honored place to her through whose liberality we have been\r\nenabled at last to complete this work. We are happy to state that\r\nMrs. Eddy's will was not contested by any of the descendents of the\r\nnoble Francis Jackson, but by Jerome Bacon, a millionaire, the\r\nwidower of her eldest daughter who survived the mother but one\r\nweek. When the suit was entered the daughters of Mrs. Eddy, Sarah\r\nand Amy, her only surviving children, in a letter to the executor\r\nof the estate, Hon. C. R. Ransom, said: \"We hereby consent and\r\nagree that, in case this suit now pending in the court shall be\r\ndecided against the claims of Lucy Stone and Susan B. Anthony, we\r\nwill give to them the net amount of any sum that as heirs may be\r\nawarded to us, in accordance with our mother's will.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nCONNECTICUT.\r\n\r\n     Prudence Crandall--Eloquent Reformers--Petitions for\r\n     Suffrage--The Committee's Report--Frances Ellen Burr--Isabella\r\n     Beecher Hooker's Reminiscences--Anna Dickinson in the Republican\r\n     Campaign--State Society Formed, October 28, 29,\r\n     1869--Enthusiastic Convention in Hartford--Governor Marshall\r\n     Jewell--He Recommends More Liberal Laws for Women--Society Formed\r\n     in New Haven, 1871--Governor Hubbard's Inaugural, 1877--Samuel\r\n     Bowles of the _Springfield Republican_--Rev. Phebe A. Hanaford,\r\n     Chaplain, 1870--John Hooker, esq., Champions the Suffrage\r\n     Movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Connecticut has always been celebrated for its puritanical\r\ntheology, political conservatism and rigid social customs, it was\r\nnevertheless the scene of some of the most hotly contested of the\r\nanti-slavery battles. While its leading clergymen and statesmen\r\nstoutly maintained the letter of the old creeds and constitutions,\r\nthe Burleighs, the Mays, and the Crandalls strove to illustrate the\r\ntrue spirit of religion and republicanism in their daily lives by\r\n\"remembering those that were in bonds as bound with them.\"\r\n\r\nThe example of one glorious woman like Prudence Crandall,[158] who\r\nsuffered shameful persecutions in establishing a school for colored\r\ngirls at Canterbury, in 1833, should have been sufficient to rouse\r\nevery woman in Connecticut to some thought on the basic principles\r\nof the government and religion of the country. Yet we have no\r\nrecord of any woman in that State publicly sustaining her in that\r\ngrand enterprise, though no doubt her heroism gave fresh\r\ninspiration to the sermons of Samuel J. May, then preaching in the\r\nvillage of Brooklyn, and the speeches and poems of the two eloquent\r\nreformers, Charles C. and William H. Burleigh. The words and deeds\r\nof these and other great souls, though seeming to slumber for many\r\nyears, gave birth at last to new demands for another class of\r\noutraged citizens. Thus liberty is ever born of the hateful spirit\r\nof persecution. One question of reform settled forever by\r\nthe civil war, the initiative for the next was soon taken. In\r\n_The Revolution_ of January 16, 1868, we find the following\r\nwell-considered report on woman's enfranchisement, presented by a\r\nminority of the Committee on Constitutional Amendments to the\r\nlegislature of Connecticut at its session of 1867:\r\n\r\n     The undersigned members of the committee believe that the prayer\r\n     of the petitioners ought to be granted. It would be much easier\r\n     for us to reject the petition and silently to acquiesce in the\r\n     opinions of the majority upon the subject to which it relates,\r\n     but our attention was challenged and an investigation invited by\r\n     the bold axioms upon which the cause of suffrage for woman was\r\n     claimed to rest, and the more we have examined the subject the\r\n     more convinced we have become that the logic of our institutions\r\n     requires a concession of that right. It is claimed by some that\r\n     the right to vote is not a natural right, but that it is a\r\n     privilege which some have acquired, and which may be granted to\r\n     others at the option of the fortunate holders. But they fail to\r\n     inform us how the possessors first acquired the privilege, and\r\n     especially how they acquired the rightful power to withhold that\r\n     privilege from others, according to caprice or notions of\r\n     expediency. We hold this doctrine to be pernicious in tendency,\r\n     and hostile to the spirit of a republican government; and we\r\n     believe that it can only be justified by the same arguments that\r\n     are used to justify slavery or monarchy--for it is an obvious\r\n     deduction of logic that if one thousand persons have a right to\r\n     govern another thousand without their consent, one man has a\r\n     right to govern all.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Lincoln tersely said, \"If slavery is not wrong nothing is\r\n     wrong.\" So it seems to us that if the right to vote is not a\r\n     natural right, there is no such thing as a natural right in human\r\n     relations. The right to freedom and the right to a ballot both\r\n     spring from the same source. The right to vote is only the right\r\n     to a legitimate use of freedom. It is plain that if a man is not\r\n     free to govern himself, and to have a voice in the taxation of\r\n     his own property, he is not really free in any enlightened sense.\r\n     Even Edward I. of England said, \"It is a most equitable rule that\r\n     what concerns all should be approved by all.\" This must\r\n     rightfully apply to women the same as to men. And Locke, in his\r\n     essay on civil government, said, \"Nothing is more evident than\r\n     that creatures of the same species and rank, promiscuously born\r\n     to the same advantages of nature, and the use of the same\r\n     faculties, should also be equal, one with another, without\r\n     subordination or subjection.\" Talleyrand said, as an argument for\r\n     monarchy, \"The moment we reject an absolutely universal suffrage,\r\n     we admit the principle of aristocracy.\" The founders of this\r\n     nation asserted with great emphasis and every variety of\r\n     repetition, the essential equality of human rights as a\r\n     self-evident truth. The war of the Revolution was justified by\r\n     the maxim, \"Taxation without representation is tyranny\"; and all\r\n     republics vindicate their existence by the claim that\r\n     \"Governments derive their just power from the consent of the\r\n     governed.\" Yet woman, in Connecticut, is governed without her\r\n     consent, and taxed without representation.\r\n\r\n     Lord Camden, one of England's ablest jurists, long ago declared,\r\n     \"My position is this--taxation and representation are\r\n     inseparable. The position is founded in a law of nature--nay\r\n     more, it is itself an eternal law of nature.\" Our forefathers\r\n     held to this principle, and fought seven years to establish it.\r\n     They maintained their favorite theory of government against\r\n     immense odds, and transmitted to their posterity the great work\r\n     of putting it logically into practice. It is acknowledged by this\r\n     legislature that \"taxation without representation is tyranny,\"\r\n     and that \"governments derive their just power from the consent of\r\n     the governed.\" If these phrases are anything more than the\r\n     meaningless utterances of demagogues, anything more than the\r\n     hypocritical apologies of rebellious colonies in a strait--then\r\n     we submit that a _prima facie_ case for woman's right to vote has\r\n     already been made out. To declare that a voice in the government\r\n     is the right of all, and then give it to less than half, and that\r\n     to the fraction to which the theorist himself happens to belong,\r\n     is to renounce even the appearance of principle.\r\n\r\n     It is plain to your committee that neither the State nor the\r\n     nation can have peace on this suffrage question until some fair\r\n     standard shall be adopted which is not based on religion, or\r\n     color, or sex, or any accident of birth--a test which shall be\r\n     applicable to every adult human being. In a republic the ballot\r\n     belongs to every intelligent adult person who is innocent of\r\n     crime. There is an obvious and sufficient reason for excluding\r\n     minors, state-prison convicts, imbeciles and insane persons, but\r\n     does the public safety require that we shall place the women of\r\n     Connecticut with infants, criminals, idiots and lunatics? Do they\r\n     deserve the classification? It seems to your committee that to\r\n     enfranchise woman--or rather to cease to deprive her of the\r\n     ballot, which is of right hers, would be reciprocally beneficial.\r\n     We believe that it would elevate the character of our\r\n     office-holders; that it would purify our politics; that it would\r\n     render our laws more equitable; that it would give to woman a\r\n     protection against half the perils which now beset her; that it\r\n     would put into her hands a key that would unlock the door of\r\n     every respectable occupation and profession; that it would insure\r\n     a reconstruction of our statute laws on a basis of justice, so\r\n     that a woman should have a right to her own children, and a right\r\n     to receive and enjoy the proceeds of her own labor. John Neal\r\n     estimates that the ballot is worth fifty cents a day to every\r\n     American laborer, enabling each man to command that much higher\r\n     wages. Does not gentlemanly courtesy, as well as equal justice,\r\n     require that that weapon of defense shall be given to those\r\n     thousands of working women among us who are going down to\r\n     prostitution through three or four half-paid, over-crowded\r\n     occupations?\r\n\r\n     It is said that woman is now represented by her husband, when she\r\n     has one; but what is this representation worth when in\r\n     Connecticut, two years ago, all of the married woman's personal\r\n     property became absolutely her husband's, including even her\r\n     bridal presents, to sell or give away, as he saw fit--a statute\r\n     which still prevails in most of the States? What is that\r\n     representation worth when even now, in this State, no married\r\n     woman has the right to the use of her own property, and no woman,\r\n     even a widow, is the natural guardian of her own children? Even\r\n     in Connecticut, under man's representation, a widow whose husband\r\n     dies without a will is regarded by law as an encumbrance on the\r\n     estate which she, through years of drudgery, has helped to\r\n     acquire. She can inherit none of the houses or land, but has\r\n     merely the use of one-third, while the balance goes to his\r\n     relatives--rich, perhaps, and persons whom she never saw. Does\r\n     not this suggest reasons why woman should wish to represent\r\n     herself?\r\n\r\n     It is said that women do not desire the ballot. This is by no\r\n     means certain. It can be ascertained only by taking a vote. It is\r\n     not proved by the fact that they have not yet generally clamored\r\n     for the right, nor by the fact that some protest against it. In\r\n     Persia, it is a law of society that virtuous women shall appear\r\n     in public with their faces covered, and instead of murmuring at\r\n     the restraint, they are universal in upholding it, and wonder at\r\n     the immodesty and effrontery of English women who appear upon the\r\n     streets unveiled. Custom hardens us to any kind of degradation.\r\n     When woman was not admitted to the dinner-table as an equal with\r\n     man, she undoubtedly thought the exclusion was perfectly proper,\r\n     and quite in the nature of things, and the dinner-table became\r\n     vile and obscene. When she was forbidden to enter the church, she\r\n     approved the arrangement, and the church became a scene of\r\n     hilarity and bacchanalian revel. When she was forbidden to take\r\n     part in literature, she thought it was not her sphere, and\r\n     disdained the alphabet, and the consequence was that literature\r\n     became unspeakably impure, so that no man can now read in public\r\n     some of the books that were written before woman brought chastity\r\n     and refinement into letters. The Asiatics are probably not in\r\n     favor of political liberty, or the American Indians in favor of\r\n     civilization; but that does not prove that these would be bad for\r\n     them, especially if thousands of the most enlightened did desire\r\n     and demand the change. It is assumed that women are not in favor\r\n     of this right; how can this be better ascertained than by\r\n     submitting to them the question to vote upon--\"yes\" or \"no.\"\r\n\r\n     If this legislature shall be averse to trusting woman to give her\r\n     opinion even on the question of her own enfranchisement, we\r\n     recommend that an amendment, striking the word \"male\" from the\r\n     State constitution, be submitted to the qualified electors of the\r\n     State. Can there be any possible danger in trusting those who\r\n     have trusted us? They, not we, are the law-makers. An assembly is\r\n     elected only because it would be inconvenient for all the\r\n     citizens to vote upon every statute. But when any change in the\r\n     fundamental law is seriously asked, it should be remitted to the\r\n     people without hesitation, especially when that proposed change\r\n     will render our logic consistent, and our institutions\r\n     harmonious; when it will enforce the democratic doctrine that, in\r\n     society, every human being has a right to do anything that does\r\n     not interfere with the rights of others, and when it will\r\n     establish equality in place of partiality, and vindicate the\r\n     principle of All Rights for All. We therefore recommend the\r\n     adoption of the following resolution: [Here follows a resolution\r\n     submitting to the people an amendment of the constitution giving\r\n     women the right to vote equally with men.]\r\n\r\nThe members of the committee who signed this early declaration in\r\nfavor of the rights of women should be remembered with honor. They\r\nare Henry Ashley, William Steele and J. D. Gallup, jr. The\r\nresolution recommended received 93 votes in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, against 111 in opposition. So strong an expression\r\nin favor of it at that time is a noteworthy fact in the history of\r\nthe cause.\r\n\r\nThe petitions that called out this able report were secured through\r\nthe influence of Frances Ellen Burr, who may be said to have been\r\nthe pioneer of woman suffrage in Connecticut. She had made several\r\nattempts, through conversations with influential friends, to\r\norganize a State society many years before. From the inauguration\r\nof the State association until the present time Miss Burr has been\r\none of its most efficient members, and has done more to popularize\r\nthe question of woman suffrage throughout the State than any other\r\nperson. Her accomplishments as a writer and speaker, as a reporter\r\nand stenographer, as well as her connection with the _Hartford\r\nTimes_ (a journal that has a very large circulation in the State),\r\nedited by her brother, have qualified her for wide and efficient\r\ninfluence. Her niece, Mrs. Ella Burr McManus, edits a column in\r\nthat paper, under the head of \"Social Notes.\" She is also an\r\nadvocate of suffrage for women, and makes telling points, from week\r\nto week, on this question. In issuing the first numbers of _The\r\nRevolution_, the earliest words of good cheer came from Frances\r\nEllen Burr.[159]\r\n\r\nThe general rebellion among women against the old conditions of\r\nsociety and the popular opinions as to their nature and destiny,\r\nhas been organized in each State in this Union by the sudden\r\nawakening of some self-reliant woman, in whose soul had long\r\nslumbered new ideas as to her rights and duties, growing out of\r\npersonal experiences or the distant echoes of onward steps in other\r\nlocalities. In Connecticut this woman was Isabella Beecher Hooker,\r\nwho had scarcely dared to think, and much less to give shape in\r\nwords, to the thoughts that, like unwelcome ghosts, had haunted her\r\nhours of solitude from year to year. Elizabeth Barrett Browning\r\ndescribes a hero as one who does what others do but say; who says\r\nwhat others do but think; and thinks what others do but dream. The\r\nsuccessive steps by which Mrs. Hooker's dreams at last took shape\r\nin thoughts, words and actions, and brought her to the woman\r\nsuffrage platform, are well told by herself:\r\n\r\n     My mind had long been disturbed with the tangled problem of\r\n     social life, but it involved so many momentous questions that I\r\n     could not see where to begin nor what to do. I could only protest\r\n     in my heart, and leave the whole matter for God[160] to deal with\r\n     in his wisdom. Thus matters stood until the year 1861, when Anna\r\n     Dickinson, then a girl of nineteen, came to Hartford to speak in\r\n     behalf of the Republican party, particularly on its hostility to\r\n     the extension of slavery. I shall never forget the dismay--I know\r\n     not what else to call it--which I felt at the announcement of her\r\n     first speech in one of our public halls, lest harm should come to\r\n     the political cause that enlisted my sympathies, and anxiety\r\n     about the speaker, who would have to encounter so much adverse\r\n     criticism in our conservative and prejudiced city. It was\r\n     certainly a most startling occurrence, that here in my very home,\r\n     where there had been hardly a lisp in favor of the rights of\r\n     women, this girl should speak on political subjects, and that,\r\n     too, upon the invitation of the leaders of a great political\r\n     party. Here was a stride, not a mere step; and a stride almost to\r\n     final victory for the suppressed rights of women.\r\n\r\n     My husband and I, full of anxiety and apprehension, but full,\r\n     too, of determination to stand by one who so bravely shook off\r\n     her trammels, went to hear this new Joan of Arc, and in a few\r\n     minutes after she began we found ourselves, with the rest of the\r\n     large audience, entranced by her eloquence. At the close of the\r\n     meeting we went with many others to be introduced and give her\r\n     the right hand of fellowship. She came home with us for the\r\n     night, and after the family retired she and I communed together,\r\n     heart to heart, as mother and daughter, and from this sweet,\r\n     grand soul, born to the freedom denied to all women except those\r\n     known as Quakers, I learned to trust as never before the\r\n     teachings of the inner light, and to know whence came to them the\r\n     recognition of equal rights with their brethren in the public\r\n     assembly.\r\n\r\n     It was she who brought me to the knowledge of Mrs. John Stuart\r\n     Mill, and her remarkable paper on \"The Enfranchisement of Women,\"\r\n     in _The Westminster Review_. She told me, too, of Susan B.\r\n     Anthony, a fearless defender of true liberty and woman's right of\r\n     public speech; but I allowed an old and ignorant prejudice\r\n     against her and Mrs. Stanton to remain until the year 1864, when,\r\n     going South to nurse a young soldier who was wounded in the war,\r\n     I met Mrs. Caroline Severance from Boston, who was residing in\r\n     South Carolina, where her husband was in the service of the\r\n     government, who confirmed what Miss Dickinson had told me of Miss\r\n     Anthony, and unfolded to me the whole philosophy of the woman\r\n     suffrage movement.\r\n\r\n     She afterwards invited me to her home near Boston, where I joined\r\n     Mr. Garrison and others in issuing a call for a convention, which\r\n     I attended, and aided in the formation of the New England Woman\r\n     Suffrage Association. At this meeting, which I will not attempt\r\n     to describe, I met Paulina Wright Davis, whose mere presence upon\r\n     the platform, with her beautiful white hair and her remarkable\r\n     dignity and elegance, was a most potent argument in favor of\r\n     woman's participation in public affairs. I sought an introduction\r\n     to her, and confessing my prejudice against Mrs. Stanton and Miss\r\n     Anthony, whom I had never yet seen, she urged me to meet them as\r\n     guests at her home in Providence; and a few weeks later, under\r\n     the grand old trees of her husband's almost ducal estate, we went\r\n     over the whole subject of man's supremacy and woman's subjection\r\n     that had lain so many years a burden upon my heart, and, sitting\r\n     at their feet, I said: \"While I have been mourning in secret over\r\n     the degradation of woman, you have been working, through\r\n     opposition and obloquy, to raise her to self-respect and\r\n     self-protection through enfranchisement, knowing that with equal\r\n     political rights come equal social and industrial opportunities.\r\n     Henceforth, I will at least share your work and your obloquy.\"\r\n\r\n     In September, 1869, just one year from that time, after spending\r\n     several weeks in correspondence with friends all over the State,\r\n     and making careful preliminary arrangements, I issued a call for\r\n     the first woman suffrage convention that was ever held in\r\n     Connecticut, at which a State society was formed. To my surprise\r\n     and satisfaction, the city press each day devoted several columns\r\n     to reports of our proceedings, and the enthusiasm manifested by\r\n     the large audiences was as unexpected as it was gratifying. The\r\n     speakers were worthy of the reception given them, and few\r\n     occasions have gathered upon one platform so notable an\r\n     assemblage of men and women.[161] The resolutions which formed\r\n     the basis of the discussions were prepared and presented by Mr.\r\n     Hooker:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That there is no consideration whatever that\r\n          makes the right of suffrage valuable to men, or that makes\r\n          it the duty or the interest of the nation to concede it to\r\n          men, that does not make it valuable to women, and the duty\r\n          and interest of the nation to concede it to women.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the ballot will bring to woman a higher\r\n          education, larger industrial opportunities, a wider field\r\n          for thought and action, a sense of responsibility in her\r\n          relations to the public welfare, and, in place of mere\r\n          complaisance and flattery, the higher and truer respect of\r\n          men.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That political affairs, involving nearly all\r\n          those questions that relate to the welfare of the nation and\r\n          the progress of society towards a perfect Christian\r\n          civilization, ought to interest deeply every intelligent\r\n          mind and every patriotic heart; and, while women love their\r\n          country and the cause of Christian progress no less than\r\n          men, they ought to have the same opportunity with men to\r\n          exert a political power in their behalf.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That in the alarming prevalence of public\r\n          dishonesty and private immorality, which the present forces\r\n          on the side of public and private virtue are proving wholly\r\n          unable to control, it is our firm conviction that women,\r\n          educated to the responsibilities of a participation with men\r\n          in political rights, would bring to the aid of virtuous men\r\n          a new and powerful element of good, which cannot be spared,\r\n          and for which there can be no substitute.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That in advocating the opening to woman of this\r\n          larger sphere, we do not undervalue her relations as a wife\r\n          and mother, than which none can be more worthy of a true\r\n          woman's love and pride; but it is only by a full development\r\n          of her faculties and a wide range for her thought that she\r\n          can become the true companion of an intelligent husband, and\r\n          the wise and inspiring educator of her children; while mere\r\n          domestic life furnishes no occupation to the great number of\r\n          women who never marry, and a very inadequate one to those\r\n          who, at middle age, with large experience and ripe wisdom,\r\n          find their children grown up around them and no longer\r\n          needing their care.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That all laws which recognize a superior right\r\n          in the husband to the children whom the wife has borne, or a\r\n          right on the part of the husband to the property of the\r\n          wife, beyond the right given to her in his property, and all\r\n          laws which hold that husband and wife do not stand in all\r\n          respects in the relation of equals, ought to be abrogated,\r\n          and the perfect equality of husband and wife established.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That this equality of position and rights we\r\n          believe to have been intended by the Creator as the ultimate\r\n          perfection of the social state, when he said, \"Let us make\r\n          man in our image, after our likeness, and let THEM have\r\n          dominion\"; and to have been a part of our Savior's plan for\r\n          a perfect Christian society, in which an Apostle says,\r\n          \"there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor\r\n          female.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Hartford Courant_, in its description of the convention, said:\r\n\r\n     After a speech by Mr. Garrison, the Hutchinsons sang some of the\r\n     religious songs of the Southern negroes with excellent taste, and\r\n     then, led by them, the whole audience united in the chorus; and\r\n     as the melody rose strong and clear a pathos fell upon the\r\n     assembly that brought tears to many eyes. The tableau upon the\r\n     stage was striking and memorable. There stood the family of\r\n     singers, with the same cheerful, hopeful courage in their\r\n     uplifted faces with which for twenty years they have sung of the\r\n     good time _almost_ here, of every reform; there stood William\r\n     Lloyd Garrison, stern Puritan, inflexible apostle, his work\r\n     gloriously done in one reform, lending the weight of his\r\n     unwearied, solid intellect to that which he believes is the last\r\n     needed; there was Mrs. Paulina Wright Davis, a Roman matron in\r\n     figure, her noble head covered with clustering ringlets of white,\r\n     courageous after a quarter of a century of unsullied devotion,\r\n     though she had just confessed that sometimes she was almost\r\n     weary; there was Miss Anthony, unselfish, patient, wise and\r\n     practical; the graceful Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, the poet of the\r\n     movement; the tall and elegant Mrs. Celia Burleigh; the\r\n     benevolent Dr. Clemence Lozier; Mrs. Isabella B. Hooker, with\r\n     spiritual face and firm purpose, just taking her place in the\r\n     reform that has long had her heart and deep conviction, and many\r\n     others of fine presence and commanding beauty--matrons, with gray\r\n     hair and countenances illuminated with lives of charity; young\r\n     women, flushed with hope; and as the grand Christian song went\r\n     on, many a woman, leaning against a supporting pillar, gave way\r\n     to the tears that would come, tears of hope deferred, tears of\r\n     weary longings, tears of willing, patient devotion--e'en though\r\n     it be a cross that raiseth me--and then the benediction, and the\r\n     assembly dispersed, touched, it may be, into a moment's sympathy.\r\n     * * *\r\n\r\n     At the closing evening session the opera house was completely\r\n     filled by an audience whose attendance was a compliment. * * *\r\n     The chairman, Rev. N. J. Burton, said: \"Has not this convention\r\n     been a success? I say, emphatically, it has. We have had the very\r\n     best of audiences at every session, and we have provided speakers\r\n     as good as the audience. We have not given you even one poor\r\n     speech. I thank the audience and the speakers, one and all. I\r\n     feel like thanking everybody, myself included, as chairman. In\r\n     Stewart's store in New York they told me 1,500 persons were\r\n     employed, all guided by one brain up-stairs, and that one brain\r\n     giving the store a national reputation. This convention has been\r\n     inspired and managed by one person--Mrs. Hooker of this city.\"\r\n     After speculating as to the possible oratorical power of Mrs. H.,\r\n     had she received the advantages and enjoyed the practice of her\r\n     brother, who spoke the previous evening, he said: \"But of course\r\n     Mrs. Hooker couldn't vote, nor be a member of the legislature, or\r\n     even a justice of the peace. Insufferable nonsense! If such women\r\n     don't vote before I die--well, like Gough's obstinate deacon, I\r\n     won't die till they do.\"\r\n\r\n     On motion of Franklin Chamberlin, esq., the thanks of the\r\n     convention were tendered to Mrs. Hooker for her efforts. At her\r\n     request the chairman said that she was wholly surprised by this\r\n     reference to herself. She would only say, \"Thank God for our\r\n     success,\" to which the chairman added, \"Amen and Amen.\" He then\r\n     introduced Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, daughter of the late\r\n     Judge Cady of Albany, wife of the Hon. Henry B. Stanton of New\r\n     York, and editor of _The Revolution_. She is perhaps fifty, and\r\n     in general appearance much resembles Mrs. Davis. She is\r\n     apparently in robust health, dresses in black, with just enough\r\n     of white lace, and, with her gray hair loosely gathered, and her\r\n     strong, symmetrical and refined face and perfect self-possession,\r\n     is a noble-looking woman. Her address, or oration, was before\r\n     her, but she was not hampered by it. Her voice is clear, her\r\n     gesticulation simple, and her general manner not surpassed by\r\n     Wendell Phillips. Rough notes of an oration so finished can only\r\n     indicate the main drift of her thoughts. * * * The eloquent\r\n     peroration was heard in profound silence, followed by\r\n     enthusiastic applause. * * * The chairman read the constitution\r\n     and offered it for signatures, and the officers of the\r\n     Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association were chosen.[162]\r\n\r\nIn _The Revolution_ of November 11, 1869, Mrs. Stanton giving a\r\ndescription of the convention, refers to the liberality of the\r\ngovernor, Marshall Jewell, and the genial hospitalities of his\r\nnoble wife:[163]\r\n\r\n     In company with Mrs. Howe and Miss Anthony, we were entertained\r\n     at the governor's mansion, a fine brick building in the heart of\r\n     the town. It has a small pond on one side, and eight acres of\r\n     land, laid out in gardens, walks and lawns, with extensive\r\n     greenhouses and graperies. The house is spacious, elegantly and\r\n     tastefully furnished, with all the comforts and luxuries that\r\n     wealth can command. With a conservatory, library, pictures,\r\n     statuary, beautiful (strong-minded) wife and charming daughters,\r\n     the noble governor is in duty bound to remain the happy, genial,\r\n     handsome man he is to-day. Though the governor, owing to his\r\n     pressing executive duties, did not honor our convention with his\r\n     presence, we feel assured, in reading over his last able message,\r\n     that he feels a deep interest in the education and elevation of\r\n     women. In speaking of their school system, he calls attention to\r\n     the low wages of female teachers, and the injustice of excluding\r\n     girls from the scientific schools and polytechnic institutions in\r\n     the State. He says:\r\n\r\n          I would especially call the attention of the legislature to\r\n          the importance of furnishing to women such educational\r\n          facilities as will better fit them for the industrial\r\n          pursuits which the true progress of the times is opening to\r\n          them.\r\n\r\n     On the rights of married women, he says:\r\n\r\n          While our laws with regard to married women have been\r\n          amended from time to time for several years past, so as to\r\n          secure to them in a more ample manner their property, held\r\n          before or acquired after marriage, yet we are still\r\n          considerably behind many of our sister States, and even\r\n          conservative England, in our legislation on the subject. I\r\n          would recommend to your favorable consideration such an\r\n          amendment of our laws as will secure to a married woman all\r\n          her property, with the full control of it during her married\r\n          life, and free from liability for any debts, except those\r\n          contracted by herself or for which she has voluntarily made\r\n          herself responsible, with the same right on the part of the\r\n          husband to an interest in her property, on his surviving\r\n          her, that she now has, or that it may be best to give her,\r\n          in his.\r\n\r\n     On the subject of divorce the governor says:\r\n\r\n          I recommend a revision of our laws with regard to divorce.\r\n          According to the report of the State librarian there were in\r\n          the State last year 4,734 marriages and 478 divorces.\r\n          Discontented people come here from other States, to take\r\n          advantage of what is called our liberal legislation, to\r\n          obtain divorces which would be denied them at home. As the\r\n          sacredness of the marriage relation lies at the foundation\r\n          of civilized society, it should be carefully guarded. Under\r\n          our present laws the causes of divorce are too numerous, and\r\n          not sufficiently defined, and too wide a discretion is given\r\n          to the courts. I think the law of 1849 should be modified,\r\n          and so much of the statute as grants divorces for \"any such\r\n          misconduct as permanently destroys the happiness of the\r\n          petitioner, and defeats the purposes of the marriage\r\n          relation,\" should be repealed. I would also suggest that the\r\n          law provide that no decree of divorce shall take effect till\r\n          one year after it is granted.\r\n\r\n          In conversation with the governor on this point in his\r\n          message he stated the singular fact that the majority of the\r\n          applications for divorce were made by women. If this be so,\r\n          we suggested that the laws of Connecticut should stand as\r\n          they are until the women have the right of suffrage, that\r\n          they may have a voice in a social arrangement in which they\r\n          have an equal interest with man himself. If Connecticut,\r\n          with its blue laws, disloyal Hartford convention, and\r\n          Democracy, has, nevertheless, been a Canada for fugitive\r\n          wives from the yoke of matrimony, pray keep that little\r\n          State, like an oasis in the desert, sacred to sad wives, at\r\n          least until the sixteenth amendment of the federal\r\n          constitution shall give the women of the republic the right\r\n          to say whether they are ready to make marriage, under all\r\n          circumstances, for better or worse, an indissoluble tie. We\r\n          have grave doubts as to the sacredness of a relation in\r\n          which the subject-class has no voice whatever in the laws\r\n          that regulate it. We shall never know what \"laws lie at the\r\n          foundation of all civilized society\" until woman's thought\r\n          finds expression in the State, the church and the home. It\r\n          is presumption for man longer to legislate alone on this\r\n          vital question, when woman, too, should have a word to say\r\n          in the matter.\r\n\r\n          The morning after the convention we had a pleasant breakfast\r\n          under Mr. and Mrs. Hooker's hospitable roof, where Boston\r\n          and New York amicably broke bread and discussed the\r\n          fifteenth amendment together. All the wise and witty sayings\r\n          that passed around that social board, time fails to\r\n          chronicle.\r\n\r\n     In 1877 Governor Hubbard called the attention of the legislature\r\n     to the wrongs of married women, in the following words:\r\n\r\n          There has been for the last few years in this State much\r\n          slip-shod and fragmentary legislation in respect to the\r\n          property rights of married women. The old common law assumed\r\n          the subjugation of the wife, and stripped her of the better\r\n          part of her rights of person and nearly all her rights of\r\n          property. It is a matter of astonishment that Christian\r\n          nations should have been willing for eighteen centuries to\r\n          hold the mothers of their race in a condition of legal\r\n          servitude. It has been the scandal of jurisprudence. Some\r\n          progress has been made in reforming the law in this State,\r\n          but it has been done, as I have already said, by patch-work\r\n          and shreds, sometimes ill-considered, and often so\r\n          incongruous as to provoke vexatious litigation and defy the\r\n          wisdom of the courts. The property relations of husband and\r\n          wife do not to-day rest on any just or harmonious system.\r\n          Not only has the husband absolute disposal of all his own\r\n          property freed from all dower rights, but he is practically\r\n          the owner during coverture of all his wife's estate not\r\n          specially limited to her separate use; and after her death\r\n          has, in every case, a life use in all her personal, and in\r\n          most cases in all her real property, by a title which the\r\n          wife, no matter what may have been his ill-deserts, is\r\n          powerless to impair or defeat; whereas, on the other hand,\r\n          the wife has during the husband's life no more power of her\r\n          own right to sell, convey, or manage her own estate than if\r\n          she were a lunatic or slave, and in case of his death has a\r\n          life use in only one-third part of the real estate of which\r\n          he dies possessed, and no indefeasible title whatever in any\r\n          of his personal estate. As a consequence, a husband may\r\n          strip his wife, by mere voluntary disposition to strangers,\r\n          of all claim on his estate after his death, and thus add\r\n          beggary to widowhood.\r\n\r\n          I am sure this cannot seem right to any fair-minded man.\r\n          Neither is it strange that some of our countrywomen, stung\r\n          by the injustice of the law towards their sex, should be\r\n          demanding, as a mode of redress, a part in the making of the\r\n          laws which govern them. I am confident there is manhood\r\n          enough in our own sex to right this obvious wrong to which I\r\n          have alluded.\r\n\r\n          I therefore recommend that the law on this subject be so\r\n          recast that, in all marriages hereafter contracted, the wife\r\n          shall hold her property and all her earnings for personal\r\n          services not rendered to her husband or minor children, as a\r\n          sole and separate estate, with absolute power of disposition\r\n          in her own name, and that the surviving wife shall have, by\r\n          law, the same measure of estate in the property of the\r\n          deceased husband, as the surviving husband shall be allowed\r\n          to have in the property of his deceased wife. This will\r\n          reduce their property relations to a principle of equality,\r\n          and, in my judgment, is demanded by the most obvious\r\n          dictates of justice and equity. Those who are not satisfied\r\n          with this can make a different law for themselves by\r\n          ante-nuptial settlements.\r\n\r\n          I am not unmindful that the husband alone is liable in the\r\n          first instance for the support of the family; but this is\r\n          much more than neutralized by the fact that, in most cases,\r\n          the wife's whole life is spent in the toilsome and unpaid\r\n          service of the household, and that the whole drift of her\r\n          estate, in consequence of her more unselfish and generous\r\n          nature, is towards the husband's pockets, in spite of all\r\n          the guards of the law and every consideration of prudence.\r\n\r\n     Calling attention to this stirring appeal, the _Hartford Times_,\r\n     Democratic, used the following language:\r\n\r\n          Another notable feature of the message is its outspoken and\r\n          manly call for a reformation in our laws concerning the\r\n          property rights of married women. Here as in other points it\r\n          is a model message. The governor's experience as a lawyer\r\n          has brought him often face to face with this disgraceful\r\n          one-sidedness of our laws on this subject, and in some terse\r\n          sentences he shows up the injustice more effectively than\r\n          has ever been done in any of the so-called women's rights\r\n          conventions.[164]\r\n\r\n     The following editorial from the _Springfield Republican_, gives\r\n     a good digest of the new law passed upon Governor Hubbard's\r\n     recommendation:\r\n\r\n          Connecticut has taken a great leap forward in the reform of\r\n          the property relations of married persons. The law had been\r\n          long neglected in that State, the obvious right of a married\r\n          woman to property acquired before marriage, which is now\r\n          secured in most States by constitutional provision, having\r\n          been there denied. In Massachusetts, the modification of the\r\n          former inequalities has gone on by piecemeal, till it is\r\n          said that in some respects the woman is now the more favored\r\n          party.\r\n\r\n          The new Connecticut statute also puts the burden of the\r\n          family maintenance on the man, as under most circumstances\r\n          the real bread-winner. It simply lays down the principle of\r\n          absolute equality in the rights and privileges of the\r\n          husband and wife, with the above exception. In all marriages\r\n          hereafter contracted, neither husband nor wife shall acquire\r\n          any right to or interest in any property of the other,\r\n          whether held before the marriage or acquired after the\r\n          marriage, except as provided in this law. The separate\r\n          earnings of the wife shall be her sole property. She shall\r\n          have the same right to make contracts with third persons as\r\n          if she were not married, and to convey her real and personal\r\n          estate. Her property is liable for her debts and not for\r\n          his; his is not liable for her debts, except those\r\n          contracted for the support of the family. Purchases made by\r\n          either party shall be presumed to be on the private account\r\n          of the party, but both shall be liable where any article\r\n          purchased by either shall have in fact gone to the support\r\n          of the family, or for the joint benefit of both, or for the\r\n          reasonable apparel of the wife, or for her reasonable\r\n          support while abandoned by her husband. It shall, however,\r\n          be the duty of the husband to support his family, and his\r\n          property, when found, shall be first applied to satisfy any\r\n          such joint liability. The wife shall be entitled to\r\n          indemnity for any money of her own used to pay such claims.\r\n          We have used almost the precise language of the first and\r\n          second sections of the act.\r\n\r\n          On the death of either, the survivor shall be entitled to\r\n          the use for life of one-third the estate of the deceased,\r\n          which right cannot be defeated by will. If the deceased\r\n          leaves no children or representatives of children, the\r\n          survivor is entitled to one-half instead of one-third. When\r\n          either party gives a legacy to the other, the latter may\r\n          choose between its rights under the will, and those under\r\n          the statute. Abandonment without cause may defeat this\r\n          provision, and a marriage contract may supersede it\r\n          entirely. Parties already married may contract to surrender\r\n          their present rights for those secured by this statute, such\r\n          contracts to be recorded in the probate court.\r\n\r\n          Thus we have a new and clear statute framed in accordance\r\n          with a simple principle of reform, for which the\r\n          _Republican_ has long done battle--the equality of married\r\n          persons in their rights and responsibilities of property.\r\n          The adoption of the reform is due deeply to the general\r\n          agitation of the rights of women, the efforts of Mrs.\r\n          Isabella Beecher Hooker, the Smith girls' cows, and perhaps\r\n          some flagrant instance of injustice to rich wives by tyrant\r\n          husbands near the capital. But the great occasion and\r\n          immediate cause, without which this generation might have\r\n          pleaded for it in vain, was the perception of the justice of\r\n          it by Governor Hubbard, and his open advocacy of it in his\r\n          message. Lawyers have one answer for all reforms regarding\r\n          property or civil contracts--they are impossible. But here\r\n          was undeniably the best lawyer in the State who said, and\r\n          threw the weight of his first State paper on the\r\n          proposition, that this thing was possible, and, if he said\r\n          it was possible, there was no man who could gainsay it. The\r\n          legislature took the reform on its own sense of justice and\r\n          on the assurance of Richard D. Hubbard, that it would work.\r\n\r\nOn June 6, 1870, at a second hearing[165] before the Joint\r\nCommittee on Woman Suffrage, in the capitol at New Haven, Rev.\r\nPhebe A. Hanaford of the Universalist church, Mrs. Benchley and\r\nMrs. Russell were the speakers. During that session of the\r\nlegislature Mrs. Hanaford acted as chaplain both in the Senate and\r\nHouse of Representatives, and received a check for her services\r\nwhich she valued chiefly as a recognition of woman's equality in\r\nthe clerical profession.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hooker was ably sustained in her new position by her husband,\r\na prominent lawyer of the State. Being equally familiar with civil\r\nand canon law, with Blackstone and the Bible, he was well equipped\r\nto meet the opponents of the reform at every point. While Mrs.\r\nHooker held meetings in churches and school-houses through the\r\nState, her husband in his leisure hours sent the daily press\r\narticles on the subject. And thus their united efforts stirred the\r\npeople to thought and at last roused a Democratic governor of the\r\nState to his duty on this question. From the many able tracts\r\nissued and articles published in the journals we give a few\r\nextracts. In answer to the common objections of \"free love\" and\r\n\"easy divorce,\" in the _Evening Post_ of January 17, 1871, Mr.\r\nHooker said:\r\n\r\n     The persons who advocate easy divorce would advocate it just as\r\n     strongly if there was no woman suffrage movement. The two have no\r\n     necessary connection. Indeed one of the strongest arguments in\r\n     favor of woman suffrage is, that the marriage relation will be\r\n     safer with women to vote and legislate upon it than where the\r\n     voting and legislation are left wholly to the men. Women will\r\n     always be wives and mothers, above all things else. This law of\r\n     nature cannot be changed, and I know of nobody who desires to\r\n     change it. The marriage relation will therefore always be more to\r\n     woman than to man, and we, who would give her the right to vote,\r\n     have no fear to trust to her the sanctity and purity of that\r\n     relation. It is the opponents of woman suffrage who distrust the\r\n     fidelity of woman to her divine instincts and dare not let her\r\n     vote. Our little State has been two hundred years under male\r\n     legislation, and yet a long memorial from hundreds of clergymen\r\n     and other Christian men went up to our legislature two years ago,\r\n     representing our legislation on divorce as demoralizing and as\r\n     fatal to the best interests of the marriage relation. It really\r\n     seems as if the incompetency for the management of public affairs\r\n     which by mere assumption is charged in advance upon women, has\r\n     been proved with regard to men by an actual experience of many\r\n     years. The true idea is for man and woman to share together the\r\n     responsibilities and duties of legislation, and until this is\r\n     done I have no hope for any real progress towards purity in the\r\n     administration of our public affairs. We who favor woman suffrage\r\n     speak confidently on this subject because the reform works so\r\n     well wherever it has been tried, in England, Sweden, Austria and\r\n     Wyoming Territory.\r\n\r\n     No rational man can suppose for a moment that with woman suffrage\r\n     established in England and on the continent of Europe, we in this\r\n     country, which so specially stands on equal representation, are\r\n     going to refuse it. It must be set down as one of the certain\r\n     things of the future. And when it has come, and women vote, it\r\n     will excite no more attention or comment than the voting of our\r\n     colored people.\r\n\r\n     Now if woman suffrage is to come, is it worth while to be making\r\n     the impression that the women of our country are not to be\r\n     trusted with it, and that the marriage relation is to be\r\n     imperiled by it? Above all, is it manly or just to be charging\r\n     corrupt motives on nine-tenths of those who advocate the reform?\r\n     The notoriety which to some extent its advocates must get is\r\n     almost universally painful to the women who are the subjects of\r\n     it. One noble woman, whose whole soul is in this cause, and the\r\n     purity of whose motives in this, as in everything else, I have\r\n     had good opportunity to learn, said to me, on reading Dr.\r\n     Bushnell's remark in his book on woman suffrage, that these women\r\n     were only trying to make themselves men: \"Cruel, cruel words! If\r\n     so noble a man as Dr. Bushnell so utterly fails to comprehend a\r\n     woman's nature, shall not she be allowed to speak for herself,\r\n     and no testimony be taken but hers?\"[166]\r\n\r\nMuch might be said in regard to the most famous women of\r\nConnecticut, the historic \"Maids of Glastonbury,\" celebrated for\r\ntheir resistance to taxation. After the death of Abby, July 23,\r\n1878, Mrs. Elizabeth Oakes Smith, in a beautiful tribute to the\r\nsisters, said:\r\n\r\n     Many years ago they took a stand akin to that of the illustrious\r\n     Hampden, which has made his name a synonym for patriotism as well\r\n     as just and manly opposition to unconstitutional revenue\r\n     exaction. \"The tax may be a small matter for an English gentleman\r\n     to pay, but it is too much for a British freeman to pay,\" was\r\n     the ground of his noble resistance, and this view precipitated\r\n     that great Revolution which more than all other modern movements\r\n     consolidated and strengthened the rights of the British subject.\r\n     These two women deserve to stand upon a platform side by side\r\n     with the great Hampden. Other women have paid their taxes under\r\n     protest, but Abby and Julia Smith have done more than protest;\r\n     they have suffered loss as well as inconvenience, their property\r\n     having been seized and sold again and again because of their\r\n     honest conviction that taxation without representation was as\r\n     unjust to women as to men. Their steadfastness has been the more\r\n     remarkable because, by their social position, their learning and\r\n     their wealth, they might be supposed to be indifferent to the\r\n     ballot-box, as so many thus situated claim to be. Abby and her\r\n     sister were no ordinary women. The family originally consisted of\r\n     five sisters, all more or less accomplished. The father was a man\r\n     of learning, a graduate of Yale and a clergyman. The mother was\r\n     familiar with French and Italian, and no mean astronomer. Thus\r\n     parented, it is not surprising that the Glastonbury sisters were\r\n     of marked individualism as well as superior scholarship. They\r\n     were more or less acquainted with Hebrew, Greek and Latin, and\r\n     have made a translation of the Bible from these sources, giving\r\n     its original meaning.\r\n\r\n     The maids of Glastonbury planted themselves upon the right of the\r\n     sex to suffrage, from purely philosophic and statesman-like\r\n     grounds. They had no other disabilities of which to complain--no\r\n     other grievance--no social ostracism, as is so often charged, and\r\n     most unjustly, against other advocates of the doctrine. They were\r\n     unmarried, studious, upright, simple-minded gentlewomen, and were\r\n     much esteemed and honored in the community in which they lived.\r\n     They occupied the old homestead, doing their own work, their\r\n     interests well cared for in the person of Mr. Kellogg, an\r\n     intelligent tenant of theirs, as well as friend and neighbor.\r\n\r\n     _The Hartford Post_, in a tender mention of the life and death of\r\n     Abby, with a brief sketch of the family, thus bears honorable\r\n     testimony to her worthiness:\r\n\r\n          In the death of Miss Smith the cause of woman suffrage has\r\n          met with a severe loss, as her firm resistance to what she\r\n          believed to be the unjust treatment of women greatly\r\n          encouraged her companions in the contest; her sister has\r\n          lost her chief support, and the community in which she lived\r\n          a faithful friend and a worthy exponent of the virtues of\r\n          truthfulness, firmness, and adherence to the right as she\r\n          understood it.\r\n\r\n     _The Hartford Times_ said:\r\n\r\n          A notable woman who died last week was Miss Abigail H.\r\n          Smith, of Glastonbury, Conn., one of the two sisters who\r\n          resisted the collection of their taxes on the ground that\r\n          they had no voice in the levy. It will be remembered that\r\n          their cows were seized and some of their personal property\r\n          sold two years ago. Of course there were friends who were\r\n          willing and anxious to pay the taxes, but the plucky old\r\n          ladies were fighting for a principle, and they would allow\r\n          no one to stand in the way. The notoriety, which they\r\n          neither sought nor avoided, undoubtedly did a great deal to\r\n          call public attention to the anomalous condition of woman\r\n          under the law. It would be very hard for any man to argue\r\n          successfully that he possessed any stronger natural claim to\r\n          the suffrage than was possessed by these shrewd, honest,\r\n          energetic old ladies.\r\n\r\nMany encouraging letters were written the sisters during their many\r\ntrials, of which the following is a fair specimen:\r\n\r\n                                   Near BOSTON, January 14, 1874.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MADAM: The account of your hardships is interesting, and\r\n     your action will be highly beneficial in bringing the subject to\r\n     public notice, and in leading to the correction of a great\r\n     injustice. The taxation of the property of women, without\r\n     allowing them any representation, even in town affairs, is so\r\n     unfair that it seems only necessary to bring it to public view to\r\n     make it odious and to bring about a change. Therefore you deserve\r\n     the greater honor, not only because you have suffered in a good\r\n     cause, but because you have set an example that will be followed,\r\n     and that will lead to happy results.\r\n\r\n     Your case has its parallel in every township of New England. In\r\n     the town where this is written a widow pays into the treasury\r\n     $7,830 a year, while 600 men, a number equal to half the whole\r\n     number of voters, pay $1,200 in all. Another lady pays $5,042.\r\n     Yet neither has a single vote, not even by proxy. That is, each\r\n     one of 600 men who have no property, who pay only a poll-tax, and\r\n     many of whom cannot read or write, has the power of voting away\r\n     the property of the town, while the female _owners_ have no power\r\n     at all. We have lately spent a day in celebrating the heroism of\r\n     those who threw overboard the tea; but how trifling was the\r\n     tea-tax, and how small the injustice to individuals compared with\r\n     this one of our day! The principle, however, was the same--that\r\n     there should be no taxation where there is no representation. And\r\n     this is what we ought to stand by. Please to accept the sympathy\r\n     and respect of one of your fellow citizens. No doubt you will\r\n     have the same from all in due time; or, at any rate, from all who\r\n     love to see fair play.\r\n\r\n                         Very truly yours, AMOS A. LAWRENCE.\r\n\r\n     _Miss Abby H. Smith, Glastonbury, Conn._\r\n\r\nA marked evidence of the advance of public sentiment was manifested\r\nby a decision of the Supreme Court in 1882, by which the women of\r\nConnecticut were held to have the right to practice law. The\r\nopinion of Chief-Justice Park concerning the legality of the\r\nadmission of Miss Mary Hall of Hartford to the bar, giving her the\r\nright to practice in the courts of the State, is as follows:\r\n\r\n     This is an application by a woman for admission to the bar of\r\n     Hartford county. After having completed the prescribed term of\r\n     study she has passed the examination required and has been\r\n     recommended by the bar of the county to the Superior Court for\r\n     admission, subject to the opinion of the court upon the question\r\n     whether, as a woman, she can legally be admitted. The Superior\r\n     Court has reserved the case for our advice.\r\n\r\n     The statute with regard to the admission of attorneys by the\r\n     court is the 29th section of chapter 3, title 4, of the General\r\n     Statutes, and is in the following words: \"The Superior Court may\r\n     admit and cause to be sworn as attorneys such persons as are\r\n     qualified therefor agreeably to the rules established by the\r\n     judges of said court; and no other person than an attorney so\r\n     admitted shall plead at the bar of any court of this State,\r\n     except in his own cause.\"\r\n\r\n     It is not contended, in opposition to the application, that the\r\n     language of this statute is not comprehensive enough to include\r\n     women, but the claim is that at the time it was passed its\r\n     application to women was not thought of, while the fact that\r\n     women have never been admitted as attorneys, either by the\r\n     English courts or by any of the courts of this country, had\r\n     established a common-law disability, which could be removed only\r\n     by a statute intended to have that effect.\r\n\r\n     It is hardly necessary to consider how far the fact that women\r\n     have never pursued a particular profession or occupied a\r\n     particular official position, to the pursuit or occupancy of\r\n     which some governmental license or authority was necessary,\r\n     constitutes a common-law disability for receiving such license or\r\n     authority, because here the statute is ample for removing that\r\n     disability if we can construe it as applying to women; so that we\r\n     come back to the question whether we are by construction to limit\r\n     the application of the statute to men alone, by reason of the\r\n     fact that in its original enactment its application to women was\r\n     not intended by the legislators that enacted it. And upon this\r\n     point we remark, in the first place, that an inquiry of this sort\r\n     involves very serious difficulties. No one would doubt that a\r\n     statute passed at this time in the same words would be sufficient\r\n     to authorize the admission of women to the bar, because it is now\r\n     a common fact and presumably in the minds of legislators, that\r\n     women in different parts of the country are, and for some time\r\n     have been, following the profession of law. But if we hold that\r\n     the construction of the statute is to be determined by the\r\n     admitted fact that its application to women was not in the minds\r\n     of the legislators when it was passed, where shall we draw the\r\n     line? All progress in social matters is gradual. We pass almost\r\n     imperceptibly from a state of public opinion that utterly\r\n     condemns some course of action to one that strongly approves it.\r\n     At what point, in the history of this change, shall we regard a\r\n     statute, the construction of which is to be affected by it, as\r\n     passed in contemplation of it? When the statute we are now\r\n     considering was passed, it probably never entered the mind of a\r\n     single member of the legislature that black men would ever be\r\n     seeking for admission under it. Shall we now hold that it cannot\r\n     apply to black men? We know of no distinction in respect to this\r\n     rule between the case of a statute and that of a constitutional\r\n     provision. When our State constitution was adopted in 1818 it was\r\n     provided in it that every elector should be \"eligible to any\r\n     office in the State,\" except where otherwise provided in the\r\n     constitution. It is clear that the convention that framed, and\r\n     probably all the people who voted to adopt the constitution, had\r\n     no idea that black men would ever be electors, and contemplated\r\n     only white men as within any possible application of the\r\n     provision, for the same constitution provided that only white men\r\n     should be electors. But now that black men are made electors,\r\n     will it do to say that they are not entitled to the full rights\r\n     of electors in respect to holding office, because an application\r\n     of the provision to them was never thought of when it was\r\n     adopted? Events that gave rise to enactments may always be\r\n     considered in construing them. This is little more than the\r\n     familiar rule that in construing a statute we always inquire what\r\n     particular mischief it was designed to remedy. Thus, the Supreme\r\n     Court of the United States has held that in construing the recent\r\n     amendments of the federal constitution, although they are general\r\n     in their terms, it is to be considered that they were passed with\r\n     reference to the exigencies growing out of the emancipation of\r\n     the slaves, and for the purpose of benefiting the blacks\r\n     (_Slaughter-house Cases, 16 Wall., 67_; _Strauder vs. West\r\n     Virginia, 100 U. S. Reps., 306_). But this statute was not passed\r\n     for the purpose of benefiting men as distinguished from women. It\r\n     grew out of no exigency caused by the relation of the sexes. Its\r\n     object was wholly to secure the orderly trial of causes and the\r\n     better administration of justice. Indeed, the preamble to the\r\n     first statute providing for the admission of attorneys, states\r\n     its object to be \"for the well-ordering of proceedings and pleas\r\n     at the bar.\"\r\n\r\n     The statute on this subject was not originally passed in its\r\n     present form. The first act with regard to the admission of\r\n     attorneys was that of 1708, which was as follows: \"That no\r\n     person, except in his own cause, shall be admitted to make any\r\n     plea at the bar without being first approved by the court before\r\n     whom the plea is to be made, nor until he shall take in the said\r\n     court the following oath,\" etc. (Col. Records, 1706 to 1716, page\r\n     48). This act seems to have contemplated an approval by the court\r\n     in each particular case in which an attorney appeared before it.\r\n     The first act with regard to the general admission of attorneys\r\n     appears in the revision of 1750, and is as follows: \"That the\r\n     county courts of the respective counties in this colony shall\r\n     appoint, and they are hereby empowered to approve, nominate and\r\n     appoint attorneys in their respective counties, as there shall be\r\n     occasion, to plead at the bar; * * and that no person, except in\r\n     his own case, shall make any plea at the bar in any court but\r\n     such as are allowed and qualified attorneys, as aforesaid.\" Thus\r\n     the statute stood until the revision of 1821; when, for the first\r\n     time, it took essentially its present form. Up to this time the\r\n     word \"person\" had been used in this statute only in the clause\r\n     that \"no person\" should be allowed to practice before the courts\r\n     except where formally admitted by the court, a use of the word\r\n     which, of course, could not be regarded as limited to the male\r\n     sex, as women would undoubtedly have been held to be included in\r\n     the term. The language of the statute as now adopted was as\r\n     follows: \"The county courts may make such rules and regulations\r\n     as to them shall seem proper relative to the admission and\r\n     practice of attorneys; and may approve of, admit and cause to be\r\n     sworn as attorneys, such persons as are qualified therefor\r\n     agreeably to the rules established; * * and no person not thus\r\n     admitted, except in his own cause, shall be admitted or allowed\r\n     to plead at the bar of any court.\" The statute in this form\r\n     passed through the compilations of 1835 and 1838, the revision of\r\n     1849 and the compilation of 1854, and appears, with a slight\r\n     modification, in the revision of 1866. The county courts had now\r\n     been abolished, and the power to admit attorneys, as well as to\r\n     make rules on the subject, had been given to the Superior Court;\r\n     the expression, \"such persons,\" being preserved, and the\r\n     provision that \"no person\" not thus admitted should be allowed to\r\n     plead, being omitted.\r\n\r\n     The statute finally took its present form in the revision of\r\n     1875. It retains the provision that the Superior Court may make\r\n     rules for the admission of attorneys, and provides that the court\r\n     \"may admit and cause to be sworn as attorneys such persons as are\r\n     qualified therefor agreeably to the rules established,\" and\r\n     restores the provision, dropt in the revision of 1866, that \"no\r\n     person other than an attorney so admitted shall plead at the bar\r\n     of any court in this State, except in his own cause.\"\r\n\r\n     These changes, though not such as to affect the meaning of the\r\n     statute at any point of importance to the present question, are\r\n     yet not wholly without importance. The adoption by the\r\n     legislature of the revision of the statutes becomes, both in law\r\n     and in fact, a reenactment of the whole body of statutes; and\r\n     though in determining the meaning of a statute, we are not to\r\n     regard it as then enacted for the first time, especially if there\r\n     be no change in its phraseology, yet, where there is such a\r\n     change, it follows that the attention of the revisers had been\r\n     particularly directed to that statute, as of course also that of\r\n     the legislature, and that with the changes made it expresses the\r\n     present intent of both. Thus, in this case, it is clear that the\r\n     revisers gave particular thought to the phraseology of the\r\n     statute we are considering, and put it in a form that seemed to\r\n     them best with reference to the present state of things, and\r\n     decided to leave the words \"such persons\" to stand with full\r\n     knowledge that they were sufficient to include women, and that\r\n     women were already following the profession of law in different\r\n     parts of the country. The legislators must be presumed to have\r\n     acted with the same consideration and knowledge. It would have\r\n     been perfectly easy, if either had thought best, to insert some\r\n     words of limitation or exclusion, but it was not done. Not only\r\n     so, but a clause omitted in the revision of 1866 was restored,\r\n     providing that no \"person\" not regularly admitted should act as\r\n     an attorney--a term which necessarily included women, and the\r\n     insertion of which made it necessary, if the word \"persons\" as\r\n     used in the first part of the statute should be held not to\r\n     include women, to give two entirely different meanings to the\r\n     same word where occurring twice in the same statute and with\r\n     regard to the same subject matter.\r\n\r\n     The object of a revision of statutes is, that there may be such\r\n     changes made in them as the changes in political and social\r\n     matters may demand, and where no changes are made it is to be\r\n     presumed that the legislature is satisfied with it in its present\r\n     form. And where some changes are made in a particular statute,\r\n     and other parts of it are left unchanged, there is the more\r\n     reason for the inference from this evidence that the matter of\r\n     changing the statute was especially considered, that the parts\r\n     unchanged express the legislative will of to-day, rather than\r\n     that of perhaps a hundred years ago, when it was originally\r\n     enacted.\r\n\r\n     But this statute, in the revision of 1875, is placed immediately\r\n     after another with regard to the appointment of commissioners of\r\n     the Superior Court, the necessary construction of which, we\r\n     think, throws light upon the construction of the statute in\r\n     question. That act was passed in 1855, after women had begun,\r\n     with general acceptance, to occupy a greatly enlarged field of\r\n     industry and some professional and even public positions; and it\r\n     has been held by the Superior Court, very properly we think, as\r\n     applying to women, a woman having three years ago been appointed\r\n     commissioner under it. Its language is as follows: \"The Superior\r\n     Court in any county may appoint any number of persons in such\r\n     county to be commissioners of the Superior Court, who, when\r\n     sworn, may sign writs and subpoenas, take recognizances,\r\n     administer oaths and take depositions and the acknowledgement of\r\n     deeds, and shall hold office for two years from their\r\n     appointment.\" Here the very language is used which is used in the\r\n     statute with regard to attorneys. In one it is, \"any number of\r\n     persons,\" in the other, \"such persons as are qualified.\" These\r\n     two statutes are placed in immediate juxtaposition in the\r\n     revision of 1875 and deal with kindred subjects, and it is\r\n     reasonable to presume that the revisers and legislature intended\r\n     both to receive the same construction. It would seem strange to\r\n     any common-sense observer that an entirely different meaning\r\n     should be given to the same word in the two statutes, especially\r\n     when in giving the narrower meaning to the word in the statute\r\n     with regard to attorneys, we are compelled to give it a different\r\n     meaning from that which the same word requires in the next line\r\n     of the same statute.\r\n\r\n     We are not to forget that all statutes are to be construed, as\r\n     far as possible, in favor of equality of rights. All restrictions\r\n     upon human liberty, all claims for special privileges, are to be\r\n     regarded as having the presumption of law against them, and as\r\n     standing upon their defense, and can be sustained if at all by\r\n     valid legislation, only by the clear expression or clear\r\n     implication of the law.\r\n\r\n     We have some noteworthy illustrations of the recognition of women\r\n     as eligible or appointable to office under statutes of which the\r\n     language is merely general. Thus, women are appointed in all\r\n     parts of the country as postmasters. The act of congress of 1825\r\n     was the first one conferring upon the postmaster-general the\r\n     power of appointing postmasters, and it has remained essentially\r\n     unchanged to the present time. The language of the act is, that\r\n     \"the postmaster-general shall establish post-offices and appoint\r\n     postmasters.\" Here women are not included, except in the general\r\n     term \"postmasters,\" a term which seems to imply a male person;\r\n     and no legislation from 1825 down to the present time authorizes\r\n     the appointment of women, nor is there any reference in terms to\r\n     women until the revision of 1874, which recognizes the fact that\r\n     women had already been appointed, in providing that \"the bond of\r\n     any married woman who may be appointed postmaster shall be\r\n     binding on her and her sureties.\" Some of the higher grades of\r\n     postmasters are appointed by the president, subject to\r\n     confirmation by the Senate, and such appointments and\r\n     confirmations have repeatedly been made. The same may be said of\r\n     pension agents. The acts of congress on the subject have simply\r\n     authorized \"the President, by and with the advice and consent of\r\n     the Senate, to appoint all pension agents, who shall hold their\r\n     offices for the term of four years, and shall give bond,\" etc. At\r\n     the last session of congress a married woman in Chicago was\r\n     appointed for a third term pension agent for the State of\r\n     Illinois, and the public papers stated that there was not a\r\n     single vote against her confirmation in the Senate. Public\r\n     opinion is everywhere approving of such appointments. They\r\n     promote the public interest, which is benefitted by every\r\n     legitimate use of individual ability, while mere justice, which\r\n     is of interest to all, requires that all have the fullest\r\n     opportunity for the exercise of their abilities. These cases are\r\n     the more noteworthy as being cases of public offices, to which\r\n     the incumbent is appointed for a term of years, upon a\r\n     compensation provided by law, and in which he is required to give\r\n     bond. If an attorney is to be regarded as an officer, it is in a\r\n     lower sense.\r\n\r\n     We have had pressed upon us by the counsel opposed to the\r\n     applicant, the decisions of the courts of Massachusetts,\r\n     Wisconsin and Illinois, and the United States Court of Claims,\r\n     adverse to such an application. While not prepared to accede to\r\n     all the general views expressed in those decisions, we do not\r\n     think it necessary to go into a discussion of them, as we regard\r\n     our statute, in view of all the considerations affecting its\r\n     construction, as too clear to admit of any reasonable question as\r\n     to the interpretation and effect which we ought to give it.\r\n\r\n     In this opinion Carpenter and Loomis, Js., concurred; Pardee, J.,\r\n     dissented.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, the State society held a spirited and successful\r\nconvention.[167] Julia Smith gave an extemporaneous talk to the\r\ngreat delight of the audience, who applauded continually; Mrs.\r\nCrane, a fine elocutionist, gave a reading from Carlyle; Mrs.\r\nHooker closed with a brief resume of the work the society had\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nWe are also indebted to Frances Ellen Burr for many facts, as the\r\nfollowing letter will show:\r\n\r\n                                   HARTFORD, September 17, 1885.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MISS ANTHONY: I have received your letter of inquiry. As\r\n     to that petition in 1867, I was one of the signers, and, probably\r\n     had something to do with getting the other signatures, though I\r\n     have nothing but my memory to depend on as to that; but I was\r\n     pretty much alone here in those days, on the woman suffrage\r\n     question. Who the other signers were I made an attempt to find\r\n     out in the secretary of state's office the other day, but found\r\n     that it would take days, instead of the few hours I had at my\r\n     command. I find in my journal a reference to Lucy Stone and Mr.\r\n     Blackwell addressing the committee in the House of\r\n     Representatives, and that was the committee that made the report\r\n     afterwards published in _The Revolution_. Mr. Croffut made the\r\n     opening address on the day of the hearing. He was always ready to\r\n     aid us in whatever way he could, and I felt grateful to him, for\r\n     a helping hand was doubly appreciated in those days. I find by\r\n     the journal of the House for that year that the vote on the\r\n     question was 93 yeas to 111 nays. The name of Miss Susie\r\n     Hutchinson heads one petition, with 70 others. How many other\r\n     petitions there were that year I do not know, but I believe there\r\n     have been several every year since, besides a number of\r\n     individual petitions. Since that time the House has voted\r\n     favorably on the question twice, at least, but I believe we have\r\n     never had a majority in the Senate.\r\n\r\n     You ask when I first wrote or spoke for the ballot. My first\r\n     venture in that line was in 1853. I was then at the age of\r\n     twenty-two, living with my sister in Cleveland, O., and had never\r\n     given any attention to the subject of woman suffrage, and cared\r\n     nothing about it any further than the spirit of rebellion--born\r\n     with me--against everything unjust, might be said to have made me\r\n     a radical by nature. In the fall of that year a woman's rights\r\n     convention met in Cleveland, and I attended it alone, none of the\r\n     rest of the family caring to go. In my old journal I find this\r\n     entry:\r\n\r\n          October 7, 1853. Attended a woman's rights convention which\r\n          has met here. Never saw anything of the kind before. A Mr.\r\n          Barker spent most of the morning trying to prove that\r\n          woman's rights and the Bible cannot agree. The Rev.\r\n          Antoinette L. Brown replied in the afternoon in defense of\r\n          the Bible. She says the Bible favors woman's rights. Miss\r\n          Brown is the best-looking woman in the convention. They\r\n          appear to have a number of original and pleasing characters\r\n          upon their platform, among them Miss Lucy Stone--hair short\r\n          and rolled under like a man's; a tight-fitting velvet waist\r\n          and linen collar at the throat; bombazine skirt just\r\n          reaching the knees, and trousers of the same. She is\r\n          independent in manner and advocates woman's rights in the\r\n          strongest terms:--scorns the idea of woman _asking_ rights\r\n          of man, but says she must boldly assert her own rights, and\r\n          _take_ them in her own strength. Mrs. Ernestine L. Rose, a\r\n          Polish lady with black eyes and curls, and rosy cheeks,\r\n          manifests the independent spirit also. She is graceful and\r\n          witty, and is ready with sharp replies on all occasions.\r\n          Mrs. Lucretia Mott, a Philadelphia Quaker, is meek in dress\r\n          but not in spirit. She gets up and hammers away at woman's\r\n          rights, politics and the Bible, with much vigor, then\r\n          quietly resumes her knitting, to which she industriously\r\n          applies herself when not speaking to the audience. She wears\r\n          the plain Quaker dress and close-fitting white cap. Mrs.\r\n          Frances D. Gage, the president, is a woman of sound sense\r\n          and a good writer of prose and poetry. Mrs. Caroline\r\n          Severance has an easy, pleasing way of speaking. Mr. Charles\r\n          Burleigh, a Quaker, appears to be an original character. He\r\n          has long hair, parted in the middle like a woman's, and\r\n          hanging down his back. He and Miss Stone seem to reverse the\r\n          usual order of things.\r\n\r\n     My first speech in public, I find by my old journal--which serves\r\n     me better than I thought it would--was given in Music Hall in\r\n     this city in November, 1870. This meeting was held under the\r\n     auspices of the State association, and was presided over by the\r\n     Rev. Olympia Brown. I find that in the winter of 1871 I made\r\n     addresses in various parts of the State. The journal also tells\r\n     of a good deal of trotting about to get signatures to petitions,\r\n     for I had more time to do that thing then than I have now.\r\n\r\n     The first woman suffrage meeting ever held in Hartford, and the\r\n     first, probably, in Connecticut, was the one you and Mrs. Stanton\r\n     held in Allyn Hall in December, 1867. Our State Suffrage\r\n     Association was organized in October, 1869. The signers[168] to\r\n     the call for that convention were quite influential persons.\r\n\r\n     In my hunt through the journals of the two legislative houses I\r\n     found in the House journal for 1878 that Mr. Pratt of Meriden had\r\n     presented the petition of Mr. and Mrs. Isaac C. Lewis. Mr. Clark\r\n     of Enfield, presented the petition of Lucy A. Allen; Mr.\r\n     Gallagher of New Haven presented several petitions that year, one\r\n     of them being headed by Mr. Henry A. Stillman of Wethersfield,\r\n     followed by 532 names, and another by Mrs. D. F. Connor, M. D.\r\n     Mr. Broadhead of Glastonbury presented the petition of the Smith\r\n     sisters. This unique petition Miss Mary Hall, who was with me in\r\n     the secretary's office, chanced to light upon, and she copied it.\r\n     It is a document well worth handing down on the page of history,\r\n     and runs as follows:\r\n\r\n          _The Petition of Julia E. Smith and Abby H. Smith, of\r\n          Glastonbury, to the Senate of the State of Connecticut:_\r\n\r\n          This is the first time we have petitioned your honorable\r\n          body, having twice come before the House of Assembly, which\r\n          the last time gave a majority that we should vote in town\r\n          affairs; but it was negatived in the Senate.\r\n\r\n          We now pray the highest court in our native State that we\r\n          may be relieved from the stigma of birth. For forty years\r\n          since the death of our father have we suffered intensely for\r\n          being born women. We cannot even stand up for the principles\r\n          of our forefathers (who fought and bled for them) without\r\n          having our property seized and sold at the sign-post, which\r\n          we have suffered four times; and have also seen eleven acres\r\n          of our meadow-land sold to an ugly neighbor for a tax of\r\n          fifty dollars--land worth more than $2,000. And a threat is\r\n          given out that our house shall be ransacked and despoiled of\r\n          articles most dear to us, the work of lamented members of\r\n          our family who have gone before us, and all this is done\r\n          without the least excuse of right or justice. We are told\r\n          that it is the law of the land made by the legislature and\r\n          done to us, two defenceless women, who have never broken\r\n          these laws, made by not half the citizens of this State. And\r\n          it was said in our Declaration of Independence that\r\n          \"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of\r\n          the governed.\"\r\n\r\n          For being born women we are obliged to help support those\r\n          who have earned nothing, and who, by gambling, drinking, and\r\n          the like, have come to poverty, and these same can vote away\r\n          what we have earned with our own hands. And when men meet to\r\n          take off the dollar poll-tax, the bill for the dinner comes\r\n          in for the women to pay. Neither have we husband, or\r\n          brother, or son, or even nephew, or cousin, to help us. All\r\n          men will acknowledge that it is as wrong to take a woman's\r\n          property without her consent as to take a man's without his\r\n          consent; and such wrong we suffer wholly for being born\r\n          women, which we are in no wise to blame for. To be sure, for\r\n          our consolation, we are upheld by the learned, the wise and\r\n          the good, from all parts of the country, having received\r\n          communications from thirty-two of our States, as well as\r\n          from over the seas, that we are in the right, and from many\r\n          of the best men in our own State. But they have no power to\r\n          help us. We therefore now pray your honorable body, who have\r\n          power, with the House of Assembly, to relieve us of this\r\n          stigma of birth, and grant that we may have the same\r\n          privileges before the law as though we were born men. And\r\n          this, as in duty bound, we will ever pray.\r\n\r\n                                                 JULIA and ABBY SMITH.\r\n\r\n          _Glastonbury, Conn., January 29, 1878._\r\n\r\n     The story of the Smith sisters, from 1873 and on, will be handed\r\n     down as one of the most original and unique chapters in the\r\n     history of woman suffrage. Abby Smith, with my friend Mrs.\r\n     Buckingham, attended with me the first meeting of the Woman's\r\n     Congress, in New York, in October, 1873. While there, she said\r\n     she should, on her return, address her town's people on woman\r\n     suffrage and taxation, as they had not been treated fairly in the\r\n     matter of their taxes. She did so on the fifth of November,\r\n     addressing the Glastonbury town meeting in the little red-brick\r\n     town-house of that place--a building that will always hereafter\r\n     be connected with the names of Abby and Julia Smith. Several\r\n     years after, wishing to address them again, she was refused\r\n     entrance there, so she and Julia addressed the people from an\r\n     ox-cart that stood in front. This was after their continued\r\n     warfare against \"taxation without representation\" had aroused the\r\n     opposition of their townsmen, but that first speech in 1873 was\r\n     the beginning of their fame. Abby sent it to me for publication\r\n     in the _Times_ of this city, but the editor not having room for\r\n     it sent it to the _Courant_, which gave it a place in its\r\n     columns, thus (unwittingly) setting a ball in motion that ran all\r\n     round the country, and even over the ocean. The simplicity and\r\n     uniqueness of the story of \"Abby Smith and her cows,\" gave a boom\r\n     to the cause of woman suffrage as welcome as it was unexpected.\r\n     The Glastonbury mails were more heavily laden than ever before in\r\n     the history of this hitherto unknown town, for letters came\r\n     pouring in from all quarters to the sisters. The fame did not\r\n     rest entirely on Abby and her cows; Julia and her Bible came in\r\n     for an important share, and the newspaper articles in regard to\r\n     them were a remarkable blending of cows and Biblical lore, dairy\r\n     products and Greek and Hebrew. Many of the articles were wide of\r\n     the facts, being written with a view to make a bright and\r\n     readable column. For instance, a Chicago paper got up a highly\r\n     colored article in which it said that Abby Smith's mother--Hannah\r\n     Hickok--was such an intense student that her father had a glass\r\n     cage made for her to study in. The only vestage of truth in this\r\n     story was that, lacking our modern facilities for heating, Mr.\r\n     Hickok had an extra amount of glass put into the south side of\r\n     his daughter's room that the sun might give it a little more heat\r\n     in cold weather. Hannah Hickok seems to have had a mental\r\n     equipment much above that of the average woman of that day; she\r\n     had a taste for literature, and was something of a linguist, and\r\n     wrote, moreover, at different times, quite an amount of readable\r\n     verse. She had a taste for mathematics, and also for astronomy,\r\n     and made for her own use an almanac, for these were not so plenty\r\n     then as now; she could, on awakening, tell any hour of the night\r\n     by the position of the stars. Evidently Hannah Hickok Smith was\r\n     not an ordinary woman; and it is quite as evident that her\r\n     daughters were equally original, though in a different direction.\r\n     Women who have translated the Bible are not to be met with every\r\n     day--nor men either, for that matter, but Julia Smith not only\r\n     did this, but translated it five times,--twice from the Hebrew,\r\n     twice from the Greek, and once from the Latin; and thirty years\r\n     later, or after the age of eighty, published the translation; and\r\n     then, to crown the list of marvels, married at the age of\r\n     eighty-five.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Phebe A. Hanaford]\r\n\r\n\r\n     One point more, and the one nearest my heart. You ask me about my\r\n     \"dear friend Mrs. Buckingham.\" I can give no details of her\r\n     suffrage work, but her heart was in it, and her name should be\r\n     handed down in your History. She was at one time chairman of the\r\n     executive committee of our State association, and she would, if\r\n     she had thought it necessary, have spent of her little income to\r\n     the last cent to help along the cause. She made public addresses\r\n     and wrote many suffrage articles and letters that were published\r\n     in different papers, but she made no noise about it; her work was\r\n     all done with her own characteristic gentleness. Generous to a\r\n     fault, winning and beautiful as the flowers she scattered on the\r\n     pathway of her friends, she passed on her way; and one memorable\r\n     Easter morning she left us so gently that none knew when the\r\n     sleep of life passed into the sleep of death; we only knew that\r\n     the glorious light of her eyes--a light like that which \"never\r\n     shone on sea or land\"--had gone out forever.\r\n\r\n          \"She died in beauty like the dew\r\n            Of flowers dissolved away;\r\n          She died in beauty like a star\r\n            Lost on the brow of day.\"\r\n\r\n     The Hartford Equal Rights Club[169] was organized in March, 1885,\r\n     and holds semi-monthly meetings. Its membership is not large, but\r\n     what it lacks in numbers it makes up in earnestness. Its\r\n     proceedings are reported pretty fully and published in the\r\n     _Hartford Times_, which has a large circulation, thus gaining an\r\n     audience of many thousands and making its proceedings much more\r\n     important than they would otherwise be. It is managed as simply\r\n     as possible, and is not encumbered with a long list of officers.\r\n     There are simply a president, Mrs. Emily P. Collins;[170] a\r\n     vice-president, Miss Mary Hall; and a secretary, Frances Ellen\r\n     Burr, who is also the treasurer. Debate is free to all, the\r\n     platform being perfectly independent, as far as a platform can be\r\n     independent within the limits of reason. Essays are read and\r\n     debated, and many interesting off-hand speeches are made. It is\r\n     an entirely separate organization from the Connecticut State\r\n     Suffrage Association, founded in 1869. But its membership is not\r\n     confined to the city; it invites people throughout the State, or\r\n     in other States, to become members--people of all classes and of\r\n     all beliefs. Opponents of woman suffrage are always welcome, for\r\n     these furnish the spice of debate. Among the topics discussed has\r\n     been that of woman and the church, and upon this subject Mrs.\r\n     Stanton has written the club several letters.\r\n\r\n     Last spring (1885) a number of the members of the club were given\r\n     hearings before the Committee on Woman Suffrage in the\r\n     legislature in reference to a bill then under consideration,\r\n     which was exceedingly limited in its provisions. The House of\r\n     Representatives improved it and then passed it, but it was\r\n     afterwards defeated in the Senate. Some of the meetings of the\r\n     club have been held in Hartford's handsome capitol, a room having\r\n     been allowed for its use, and a number of members of the House of\r\n     Representatives have taken part in the discussions. Mrs. Collins,\r\n     president of the club, is always to be depended upon for good\r\n     work, and Miss Hall, its vice-president, is active and efficient.\r\n     She is in herself an illustration of what women can become if\r\n     they only have sufficient confidence and force of will. She is a\r\n     practicing lawyer, and a successful one.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[158] The life of William Lloyd Garrison, Vol. 1.: The Century\r\nCompany, New York.\r\n\r\n[159] She was soon followed by Mrs. Middlebrook and Mrs. Lucy R.\r\nElms, with warm benedictions. The latter called some meetings in\r\nher neighborhood in the autumn of 1868, and entertained us most\r\nhospitably at her beautiful home.\r\n\r\n[160] Those who leave the tangled problem of life to God for\r\nsolution find, sooner or later, that God leaves it to them to\r\nsettle in their own way.--[E.

She was an honored officer of the National Suffrage\r\nAssociation until the time of her death, in 1883.\r\n\r\n[164] Mrs. Hooker writes us that the act passed upon Governor\r\nHubbard's recommendation was prepared at his request by Mr. Hooker,\r\nand was essentially the same that had been unsuccessfully urged by\r\nhim upon the legislature eight years before. She then goes on to\r\nsay: \"What part our society had in our bringing about so beneficent\r\na change in legislation, cannot be better set forth than in two\r\nprivate letters from Samuel Bowles of the _Springfield Republican_,\r\nand Governor Hubbard. While these gentlemen were friends of Mr.\r\nHooker and myself, yet, as politically opposed to each other, their\r\nunited testimony is exceedingly valuable, and since they have both\r\npassed on to a world of more perfect adjustments, I feel that\r\nnothing would give them greater satisfaction than to be put upon\r\nrecord here as among the earliest defenders of the rights of women.\r\n\r\n                                   \"SPRINGFIELD, Mass., March 28, 1877.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR MRS. HOOKER:--I return your letters and paper as you\r\n     desired. It is an interesting story, and a most gratifying\r\n     movement forward. I am more happy over the bill passed, than I am\r\n     sorry over the bill that failed. We shall move fast enough. The\r\n     first great step is this successful measure in Connecticut--the\r\n     establishment in practice of the principle of equal, mutual,\r\n     legal rights, and equal, mutual, legal responsibilities, for\r\n     which I have been preaching and praying these twenty years. We\r\n     owe the success this year, _first_ to the right of the matter;\r\n     _second_, to the agitation of the whole question which has\r\n     disseminated the perception of that right; _third_, to you and\r\n     your husband in particular; and _fourth_, to the fact that you\r\n     had in Connecticut this year a governor who was recognized as the\r\n     leading lawyer of the State, a genuine natural conservative who\r\n     yet said the measure was right and ought to go. It is this last\r\n     element that has given Connecticut its chief leadership. It is a\r\n     bigger thing than it seems at first to have an eminent\r\n     conservative lawyer on the side of such legislative reform. I\r\n     hate very much to take your husband's side against you, and yet\r\n     now that I am over fifty years old, I find I more and more\r\n     sympathize with his patience and philosophy with the slow-going\r\n     march of reform. But with such things going forward in national\r\n     politics, and such a sign in the heavens as this in Connecticut,\r\n     we ought all to be very happy--and I believe I am, in spite of\r\n     debts, hard work, fatigue and more or less chronic invalidism. At\r\n     any rate I salute you both with honor and with affection.\"\r\n\r\n                         \"Very faithfully yours,        SAMUEL BOWLES.\r\n\r\n     \"This letter I enclosed to Governor Hubbard and received the\r\n     following reply:\r\n\r\n                                        \"EASTER, April 1, 1877.\r\n\r\n     \"MY GOOD FRIEND:--It was a 'Good Friday' indeed that brought your\r\n     friendly missive.

Hinckley--Last\r\n     Words from Senator Anthony.\r\n\r\n\r\nRhode Island, though one of the smallest, is, in proportion to the\r\nnumber of its inhabitants, one of the wealthiest states in the\r\nUnion. In political organization Rhode Island, in colonial times,\r\ncontrasted favorably with the other colonies, nearly all of which\r\nrequired a larger property qualification, and some a religious test\r\nfor the suffrage. The home of Roger Williams knew nothing of such\r\nnarrowness, but was an asylum for those who suffered persecution\r\nelsewhere. Nevertheless this is now, in many respects, the most\r\nconservative of all the States.\r\n\r\nIn the November number of the _North American Review_ for 1883,\r\nSenator Anthony, in an article on the restricted suffrage in Rhode\r\nIsland, stoutly maintains that suffrage is not a natural right, and\r\nthat in adhering to her property qualification for foreigners his\r\nState has wisely protected the best interests of the people. In his\r\nwhole argument on the question, he ignores the idea of women being\r\na part of the people, and ranks together qualifications of sex,\r\nage, and residence. He quite unfairly attributes much of Rhode\r\nIsland's prosperity--the result of many causes--to her restricted\r\nsuffrage. His position in this article, written so late in life, is\r\nthe more remarkable as he had always spoken and voted in his place\r\nin the United States Senate (where he had served nearly thirty\r\nyears) strongly in favor of woman's enfranchisement. And the\r\n_Providence Journal_, which he owned and controlled, was invariably\r\nrespectful and complimentary towards the movement.\r\n\r\nWhile such a man as Senator Anthony, one of the political leaders\r\nin his State, regarded suffrage as a privilege which society may\r\nconcede or withhold at pleasure, we need not wonder that so little\r\nhas been accomplished there in the way of legislative enactments\r\nand supreme-court decisions. Nevertheless that State has shared in\r\nthe general agitation and can boast many noble men and women who\r\nhave taken part in the discussion of this subject.\r\n\r\nThe first woman suffrage association was formed in Rhode Island in\r\nDecember, 1868. In describing the initiative steps, Elizabeth B.\r\nChace in a letter to a friend, says:\r\n\r\n     In October 1868, while in Boston attending the convention that\r\n     formed the New England society, Paulina Wright Davis[171]\r\n     conceived the idea that the time had come to organize the friends\r\n     of suffrage in Rhode Island. After consultation with a few of the\r\n     most prominent friends of the cause, a call was issued for a\r\n     convention, to be held in Roger Williams Hall, Providence,\r\n     December 11th, signed by many leading names. No sooner did the\r\n     call appear than, as usual, some clergyman publicly declared\r\n     himself in opposition. The Rev. Mark Trafton, a Methodist\r\n     minister, gave a lecture in his vestry on \"The Coming Woman,\" who\r\n     was to be a good housekeeper, dress simply, and not to vote. This\r\n     was published in the _Providence Journal_, and called out a\r\n     gracefull vindication of woman's modern demands from the pen of\r\n     Mrs. Sarah Helen Whitman, the poet, and Miss Norah Perry, a\r\n     popular writer of both prose and verse. The convention was all\r\n     that its most ardent friends could have desired, and resulted in\r\n     forming an association.[172] The audience numbered over a\r\n     thousand, at the different sessions, and among the speakers were\r\n     some of the ablest men in the State. Though the friends were\r\n     comparatively few in the early days, yet there was no lack of\r\n     enthusiasm and self-sacrifice. Weekly meetings were held, tracts\r\n     and petitions circulated; conventions[173] and legislative\r\n     hearings were as regular as the changing seasons, now in\r\n     Providence, and now in Newport, following the migratory\r\n     government.\r\n\r\nMrs. Davis was president of the association for several successive\r\nyears in which her labors were indefatigable. Finally failing\r\nhealth compelled her to resign her position as president of the\r\nassociation.[174] Since then her able coadjutor Elizabeth B. Chace,\r\nhas been president of the Rhode Island Suffrage Association, and\r\nwith equal faithfulness and persistence, carried on the work. She\r\nsteadily keeps up the annual conventions and makes her appeals to\r\nthe legislature. Among the names[175] of those who have appeared\r\nfrom year to year before the Rhode Island legislature we find many\r\nable men and women from other States as well as many of their own\r\ndistinguished citizens.\r\n\r\nIn this State an effort was made early to get women on the board of\r\nmanagers for schools, prisons and charitable institutions. In a\r\nletter to Mrs. Davis, John Stuart Mill says:\r\n\r\n     I am very glad to hear of the step in advance made by Rhode\r\n     Island in creating a board of women for some very important\r\n     administrative purpose. Your proposal that women should be\r\n     empanneled on every jury where women are to be tried seems to me\r\n     very good, and calculated to place the injustice to which women\r\n     are subjected at present by the entire legal system in a very\r\n     striking light.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 an effort was made to place women on the Providence School\r\nBoard, with what success the following extracts from the daily\r\npapers show. The _Providence Press_ of April 25, 1873, says:\r\n\r\n     A shabby trick was perpetrated by the friends of John W. Angell,\r\n     which was certainly anything but \"angelic,\" and which ought to\r\n     consign the parties who committed it to political infamy.\r\n\r\n     Yesterday, for the first time in the history of this city, women\r\n     were candidates for political honors--in the fifth ward, Mrs.\r\n     Sarah E. H. Doyle, and in the fourth ward, Mrs. Rhoda A. F.\r\n     Peckham, were candidates for positions on the school committee;\r\n     both, however, failed of an election. Mrs. Doyle received the\r\n     unanimous nomination of the large primary meeting of the National\r\n     Union Republican party, and Mrs. Peckham was run as an outside\r\n     candidate against the regular nominee. These ladies would\r\n     undoubtedly have made excellent members of the committee, and\r\n     unlike a great portion of that body, would have been found in\r\n     their places at the meetings, and we should have been glad to\r\n     have seen the experiment tried of women in the position for which\r\n     their names were presented. When the polls opened in the fifth\r\n     ward, instead of Mrs. Doyle's name being on the ballots for the\r\n     place to which she had been nominated there appeared the name of\r\n     John W. Angell, esq., and until about 11 o'clock A. M. he had\r\n     the field to himself. At that hour, however, Mrs. Doyle's friends\r\n     appeared with the \"_regular_\" nomination, and from that time to\r\n     the close of the polls she received 145 votes; Mr. Angell,\r\n     notwithstanding his several hours' start in the race, only\r\n     winning by a majority of 38. From this fact it is clear that had\r\n     Mrs. Doyle's name been in its proper place at the opening of the\r\n     polls she would have beaten her opponent handsomely. Mrs.\r\n     Peckham's opponent obtained but 23 majority in a poll of 349. It\r\n     is evident from the vote yesterday, that if they have but a fair\r\n     show, women will at the next election be successful as candidates\r\n     for the school committee. Had the intelligent ladies of the fifth\r\n     ward been allowed to vote, Mrs. Doyle would have led even the\r\n     gubernatorial vote of that ward.\r\n\r\nThe _Providence Journal_ makes the following comment:\r\n\r\n     We are sorry to observe that the two estimable and admirably\r\n     qualified ladies whose names were presented for school committee\r\n     in this city, failed of success. Their influence in official\r\n     connection with the schools could not have been other than\r\n     salutary. The treatment accorded Mrs. Doyle in the fifth ward was\r\n     wofully shabby. Without her solicitation, the Republican caucus\r\n     unanimously nominated her for a member of the school committee.\r\n     Being a novice in political proceedings, she naturally enough\r\n     supposed that the party that desired her services so much as to\r\n     place her in nomination, would make provision for electing their\r\n     candidate. There was not gallantry enough in the ward, however,\r\n     for that duty, and it was not until 11 o'clock on election day\r\n     that any tickets bearing the name of Mrs. Doyle were to be found\r\n     in the ward-room; but a ticket with the names of two men was on\r\n     hand at sunrise, and the time lost in procuring tickets for the\r\n     regular nominee proved fatal to her success. Mrs. Doyle has now\r\n     learned something of the ways of politicians, and is not likely\r\n     to put her trust again in the faithfulness of ward committees.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the State association, held in Providence, on\r\nThursday, May 18, 1871, the following preamble and resolutions\r\nwere, after a full and earnest discussion, unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, It is claimed, in opposition to the demand that the\r\n     elective franchise shall be given to women, that they are\r\n     represented in the government by men, so that they do not need\r\n     the ballot for their protection, inasmuch as all their rights are\r\n     secured to them by the interest of these men in their welfare;\r\n     and, whereas, in February last, in view of the appalling facts\r\n     frequently coming to our notice, consequent upon the\r\n     mismanagement of poor-houses and asylums for the insane, this\r\n     association did earnestly petition our State legislature to enact\r\n     a law providing for the appointment of women in all the towns in\r\n     our State to act as joint commissioners with men in the care and\r\n     control of these institutions; and, whereas, in utter disregard\r\n     of our request, the Committee on State Charities, to whom it was\r\n     referred, in reporting back our petition to the House of\r\n     Representatives, did recommend that the petitioners be given\r\n     leave to withdraw, and the House, without (so far as we could\r\n     learn) one word of protest from any member thereof, did so\r\n     dispose of our petition; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That this association do most solemnly declare, that\r\n     so far from being represented in our legislature, the rights of\r\n     the women of this State were in this instance trampled under foot\r\n     therein, and the best interests of humanity, in the persons of\r\n     the poorest and most unfortunate classes, were not sufficiently\r\n     regarded, under this system of class legislation.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That, despairing of obtaining for women even the\r\n     privileges which would enable them to look after the welfare of\r\n     the destitute and the suffering, with any power or authority to\r\n     improve their condition, until equal rights in the government\r\n     itself are guaranteed to all without regard to sex, we will\r\n     henceforth make use of this treatment we have received as a new\r\n     argument in favor of the emancipation of women from the legal\r\n     status of idiots and criminals, and, with this weapon in our\r\n     hands, we will endeavor to arouse the women of our State to a\r\n     keener sense of their degraded condition, and we will never abate\r\n     our demand until an amendment to the constitution is submitted to\r\n     the people granting suffrage to the women of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That this preamble and these resolutions be offered\r\n     for publication to the daily papers of this city.\r\n\r\n                                      ELIZABETH B. CHACE, _President_.\r\n\r\n     SUSAN B. P. MARTIN, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\nFor several years the philanthropic women of Rhode Island made many\r\ndetermined efforts to secure some official positions in the\r\ncharitable institutions of the State, with what success the\r\nfollowing report by Elizabeth B. Chace, at the annual meeting of\r\nthe American Association, in Philadelphia, in 1876, will show:\r\n\r\n     The Rhode Island Woman Suffrage Association, while holding its\r\n     monthly meetings through the year, circulating petitions to the\r\n     legislature, and, in other ways, constantly endeavoring to\r\n     revolutionize the entire sentiment of the State on the question\r\n     of woman suffrage, still has less progress to report than its\r\n     friends would have desired. Our last annual meeting, as usual,\r\n     drew together a large audience. Among our speakers from abroad\r\n     was William Lloyd Garrison, who, in a speech of almost\r\n     anti-slavery force and fervor, appeared to send conviction into\r\n     many minds. Our home speakers included a clergyman of Providence\r\n     and one of our ablest lawyers, and an ex-legislator who had never\r\n     stood on our platform before.\r\n\r\n     As usual, our petitions went into the legislature. They were\r\n     referred to the Judiciary Committee, before whom we had a\r\n     hearing, at which three Providence lawyers gave us their\r\n     unqualified support and earnest advocacy. One of these men set\r\n     forth in the strongest light the injustice of our laws in regard\r\n     to the property of married women and their non-ownership of their\r\n     minor children. The committee made no report to the legislature,\r\n     and so our petitions lie over until the next session, when we\r\n     hope for some evidence of progress. In the meantime we intend to\r\n     very much increase their number. For many years we have been\r\n     begging of our law-makers to permit women to share in the\r\n     management of the penal, correctional and charitable institutions\r\n     of the State; we have, however, only succeeded in obtaining an\r\n     advisory board of women, which has been in operation for the last\r\n     six years.\r\n\r\n     Last spring a majority of these women, having become weary of the\r\n     service in which they had no power to decide that any improvement\r\n     should be made in the management of these institutions, resigned\r\n     their positions on this board, some of them giving through the\r\n     press their reasons therefor. When the time came for making the\r\n     new appointments for the year, the governor earnestly urged\r\n     these women to permit him to appoint them, voluntarily pledging\r\n     himself to recommend at the opening of the next session of the\r\n     legislature, that a bill should be passed providing for the\r\n     appointment of women on the boards of management of all these\r\n     prisons and reformatories, with the same power and authority with\r\n     which the men are invested, who now alone decide all questions\r\n     concerning them. On this condition these women consented to serve\r\n     on the advisory board a few months longer, with the understanding\r\n     that, if the legislature fails to make this important provision,\r\n     their advice will be withdrawn, and the men will be left to take\r\n     care of thieves, criminals and paupers until they are ready to\r\n     ask for our help on terms of equality and justice.\r\n\r\nIn the _Providence Journal_ appeared the following:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Doyle seems to have learned by experience that the board, as\r\n     now constituted under the law, can have no real efficiency. The\r\n     ladies are responsible for the management of no part of any of\r\n     the institutions which they are permitted officially to visit.\r\n     Their reports are not made to the boards which are charged with\r\n     the responsibility of managing these institutions, and, in the\r\n     case of the reform school, are not made to the body which elects\r\n     and controls the board of management. The State ought not to\r\n     place ladies in such an anomalous position. The women's board\r\n     should have positive duties and direct responsibilities in its\r\n     appropriate sphere, or it should be abolished. The following is\r\n     Mrs. Doyle's letter of resignation:\r\n\r\n          _To His Excellency Henry Lippitt, Governor of the State:_\r\n\r\n          SIR: Please accept my resignation as member of the Board of\r\n          Lady Visitors to the Penal and Correctional Institutions of\r\n          the State. The recent action of a part of the board, in\r\n          regard to the annual report made to the General Assembly,\r\n          makes it impossible for me to continue longer as a member.\r\n          Before the report was submitted, it was carefully examined\r\n          by the members signing it, and was acquiesced in by them, as\r\n          their signatures testify. Still further, I am confirmed in\r\n          the opinion that so important a trust as this should be\r\n          coupled with some power for action; without this we are\r\n          necessarily confined to suggestions only to the male boards,\r\n          which suggestions receive only the attention they may\r\n          consider proper. Believing that this board, as now\r\n          empowered, can have no efficiency except where its\r\n          suggestions or criticisms meet the entire approval of the\r\n          male boards, and failing to see any good which can result\r\n          from our inspections under such conditions, or any honor to\r\n          the board thus examining, I respectfully tender my\r\n          resignation.\r\n\r\n                                                    SARAH E. H. DOYLE,\r\n\r\n          _Providence, R. I._\r\n\r\n     Three more ladies of the Women's Board of Visitors to the Penal\r\n     and Correctional Institutions of the State attest the correctness\r\n     of the repeated suggestions that the board, as organized under\r\n     the existing laws, must be comparatively powerless for good. The\r\n     question now comes, will the Rhode Island General Assembly enact\r\n     a law which shall give to women certain definite duties and\r\n     responsibilities in connection with the care and correction of\r\n     female offenders? We propose to refer to this matter further. We\r\n     are requested to publish the following communications to his\r\n     excellency, the governor:\r\n\r\n          _To Henry Lippitt, Governor of Rhode Island:_\r\n\r\n          My appointment on the Women's Board of Visitors to the Penal\r\n          and Correctional Institutions of the State, which I received\r\n          from your hands for this year, I am now compelled\r\n          respectfully to resign. My experience in this board for\r\n          nearly six years has convinced me that this office, which\r\n          confers on its holders no power to decide that any\r\n          improvement shall be made in the government or workings of\r\n          these institutions, is so nearly useless that I am forced to\r\n          the conclusion that, for myself, the time spent in the\r\n          performance of its duties can be more effectively employed\r\n          elsewhere. That the influence of women is indispensable to\r\n          the proper management of these institutions I was never more\r\n          sure than I am at this moment; but to make it effectual,\r\n          that influence must be obtained by placing women on the\r\n          boards of direct control, where their judgment shall be\r\n          expressed by argument and by vote.\r\n\r\n          A board of women, whose only duties, as defined by the law,\r\n          are to visit the penal and correctional institutions, elect\r\n          its own officers and report annually to the legislature,\r\n          bears within itself the elements of weakness and\r\n          insufficiency. And if the annual reports contain any\r\n          exposure of abuses, they are sure to give offense to the\r\n          managers, to be followed by timidity and vacillation in the\r\n          board of women itself. Our late report, written with great\r\n          care and conscientious adherence to the truth, which called\r\n          the attention of the legislature to certain abuses in one of\r\n          our institutions, and to some defect in the systems\r\n          established in the others, has, thus far, elicited no\r\n          official action, has brought censure upon us from the press,\r\n          while great dissatisfaction has been created in our own body\r\n          by the failure of a portion of its members to sustain the\r\n          allegations to which the entire board, with the exception of\r\n          one absentee, had affixed their names.\r\n\r\n          When the State of Rhode Island shall call its best women to\r\n          an equal participation with men in the direction of its\r\n          penal and reformatory institutions, I have no doubt they\r\n          will gladly assume the duties and responsibilities of such\r\n          positions; and I am also sure that the beneficent results of\r\n          such cooeperation will soon be manifest, both in benefit to\r\n          individuals and in safety to the State. But under present\r\n          circumstances I most respectfully decline to serve any\r\n          longer on the advisory board of women.\r\n\r\n          _Valley Falls, R. I._               ELIZABETH B. CHACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n          GOVERNOR LIPPITT: _Dear Sir_: When I accepted an appointment\r\n          on the Ladies' Board of Visitors to the Penal and\r\n          Correctional Institutions of the State, I did so with the\r\n          hope that much good might be accomplished, especially toward\r\n          the young girls at the reform school, in whose welfare I\r\n          felt a deep interest. To that institution my attention has\r\n          been chiefly devoted during my brief experience in this\r\n          office. This experience, however, has convinced me that a\r\n          board of officers constituted and limited like this can have\r\n          very little influence toward improvement in an institution\r\n          whose methods are fixed, and which is under the exclusive\r\n          control of another set of officers, who see no necessity for\r\n          change. Those causes render this women's board so weak in\r\n          itself that I cannot consent to retain my position therein.\r\n          I therefore respectfully tender to you my resignation.\r\n\r\n                                                       ABBY D. WEAVER.\r\n\r\n          _Providence, R. I._\r\n\r\n\r\n          GOVERNOR LIPPITT: Please accept the resignation of my\r\n          commission as a member of the Ladies' Board of Visitors to\r\n          the Penal and Correctional Institutions of the State,\r\n          conferred by you in June, 1875.\r\n\r\n          Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n          _Westerly, R. I._                      ELIZA C. WEEDEN.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1880 the State association issued the following\r\naddress:\r\n\r\n     _To the friends of Woman Suffrage throughout the State of Rhode\r\n     Island:_\r\n\r\n     In behalf of the Rhode Island Woman Suffrage Association, we beg\r\n     leave to call your attention to the result of our last year's\r\n     work, and to our plans for future effort. We went before the\r\n     General Assembly with petitions for suffrage for women on all\r\n     subjects, and also with petitions asking only for school\r\n     suffrage. The former, bearing nearly 2,500 names, was presented\r\n     in the Senate and finally referred, with other unfinished\r\n     business, to the next legislature; they will thus be subject to\r\n     attention the coming year. The latter, bearing nearly 3,500\r\n     names, was presented in the House and referred to the Committee\r\n     on Education. This committee reported unanimously:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the following amendment to the constitution\r\n          of the State is hereby proposed: Article ----. Women\r\n          otherwise qualified are entitled to vote in the election of\r\n          school committees and in all legally organized\r\n          school-district meetings.\r\n\r\n     This resolution was adopted in the House by 48 to 11, but\r\n     rejected in the Senate by 20 to 13.[176] Nineteen members being\r\n     required to make a majority of a full Senate, the amendment\r\n     failed by six votes. Had the ballots in the two branches been\r\n     upon a proposition to extend general suffrage to women, they\r\n     would have been the most encouraging, and, as it is, they show\r\n     signs of progress; but a resolve to submit the question of school\r\n     suffrage to the voters of Rhode Island, ought to have been\r\n     successful this year. Why was it defeated? Simply for the lack of\r\n     political power behind it. To gain this, our cause needs a\r\n     foothold in every part of the State. We need some person or\r\n     persons in each town, to whom we can look for hearty cooeperation.\r\n     If our work is to be effective, it must not only continue as\r\n     heretofore--one of petitioning--but must include also a constant\r\n     vigilance in securing senators and representatives in the General\r\n     Assembly, favorable to woman suffrage. We propose the coming\r\n     year:\r\n\r\n     _First_--To petition congress in behalf of the following\r\n     amendment to our national constitution, viz.:\r\n\r\n          ARTICLE XVI. Section 1--The right of citizens of the United\r\n          States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United\r\n          States or by any State on account of sex. Section\r\n          2--Congress shall have power to enforce this article by\r\n          appropriate legislation.\r\n\r\n     _Second_--To secure a hearing and action upon the petitions\r\n     referred from the last Assembly, for such amendment to our State\r\n     constitution as shall extend general suffrage to women.\r\n\r\n     _Third_--To petition the General Assembly for the necessary\r\n     legislation to secure school suffrage to women.[177]\r\n\r\nThe arguments in the various hearings before the legislature with\r\nthe majority and minority reports, are the same as many already\r\npublished, in fact nothing new can be said on the question. As none\r\nof the women in this State, by trying to vote, or resisting\r\ntaxation, have tested the justice of their laws, they have no\r\nsupreme-court decisions to record.\r\n\r\nHonorable mention should be made of Dr. William F. Channing, who\r\nhas stood for many years in Providence the noblest representative\r\nof liberal thought. He is a worthy son of that great leader of\r\nreform in New England, Rev. William Ellery Channing. In him the\r\nadvocates of woman's rights have always found a steadfast friend.\r\nHe sees that this is the fundamental reform; that it is the key to\r\nthe problems of labor, temperance, social purity and the\r\ncooeperative home. Those who have had the good fortune of a personal\r\nacquaintance with Dr. Channing have felt the sense of dignity and\r\nself-respect that the delicate courtesy and sincere reference of a\r\nnoble man must always give to woman.\r\n\r\nThough Mrs. Channing has not been an active participant in the\r\npopular reforms, having led a rather retired life, yet her\r\nsympathies have been with her husband in all his endeavors to\r\nbenefit mankind. She has given the influence of her name to the\r\nsuffrage movement, and extended the most generous hospitalities to\r\nthe speakers at the annual conventions. Their charming daughters,\r\nMary and Grace, fully respond to the humanitarian sentiments of\r\ntheir parents, constituting a happy family united in life's\r\npurposes and ambitions.\r\n\r\nThe New York _Evening Post_ of September, 1875, gives the following\r\nof one of Rhode Island's brave women, but the State has not as yet,\r\nthought it worth while to honor her in any fitting manner:\r\n\r\n     Yesterday noon Miss Ida Lewis again distinguished herself by\r\n     rescuing a man who was in danger of drowning in the lower Newport\r\n     harbor. Miss Lewis first came into prominence in 1866, when she\r\n     saved the life of a soldier who had set out for a sail in a light\r\n     skiff. It was one of the coldest and most blustering days ever\r\n     known in this latitude, yet a girl but 25 years old, impelled by\r\n     the noblest spirit of humanity, ventured to the assistance of a\r\n     man who had brought himself into a sorry plight through sheer\r\n     fool-hardiness. One day, during the autumn of the next year,\r\n     while a terrible gale was raging, two men sat out to cross the\r\n     harbor with several sheep. One of the animals fell overboard\r\n     while the boat was rocked by the heavy sea, and its keepers, in\r\n     trying to save it, were in imminent peril of swamping their\r\n     craft. Ida Lewis saw them from the window of her father's\r\n     lighthouse on Lime Rock, and in a few minutes was rowing them in\r\n     safety toward the shore. After landing the men, she went back\r\n     again and rescued the sheep.\r\n\r\n     These brave deeds, with others of a less striking character, made\r\n     Miss Lewis' name famous throughout the world, and won for her the\r\n     title of \"the Grace Darling of America\"; but in 1869 the\r\n     newspapers were filled with the story of what was perhaps her\r\n     greatest exploit. On March 29 two young soldiers set sail from\r\n     Newport for Fort Adams in a small boat, under the guidance of a\r\n     boy who pretended to understand the simple rules of navigation.\r\n     Mrs. Lewis chanced to be looking out of the lighthouse window,\r\n     and saw a squall strike the boat and overturn it. She called to\r\n     her daughter, telling her of the casualty. Ida, though ill at the\r\n     time, rushed out of the house, launched her life-boat and sprang\r\n     in, with neither hat on her head nor shoes on her feet. By the\r\n     time she reached the scene of the disaster the boy had perished,\r\n     and the two soldiers were clinging desperately to the wreck,\r\n     almost ready to loose their hold from exhaustion. They were\r\n     dragged into the life-boat, and carried to Lime Rock, and, with\r\n     careful nursing, were soon sufficiently restored to proceed to\r\n     Fort Adams.\r\n\r\n     Miss Lewis' repeated acts of philanthropy have been recognized by\r\n     gifts at various times, but no national testimonial, so far as we\r\n     are aware, has yet been offered to her. True generosity, like\r\n     true virtue, is its own reward, and we of the world are not often\r\n     disposed to meddle with its quiet enjoyment by its possessor. It\r\n     seems eminently fitting, however, that among the first to receive\r\n     the new decoration to be bestowed by congress for heroic deeds in\r\n     saving life, should be the heroine of Newport harbor.\r\n\r\nWriting from Valley Falls September 9, 1885, Elizabeth B. Chace,\r\npresident of the Rhode Island Association, in summing up the steps\r\nof progress, says:\r\n\r\n     On December 4, 1884, by unanimous consent of our General Assembly\r\n     the state-house was granted to us for the first time, for a woman\r\n     suffrage convention. A large number of our best men and women,\r\n     and some of our ablest speakers[178] were present. An immense\r\n     audience greeted them and listened with eager interest\r\n     throughout. The occasion was one of the most pleasant and\r\n     profitable we have enjoyed in a long time. At the following\r\n     session of our Legislature, 1885, an amendment to our State\r\n     constitution was proposed giving the franchise to women, on equal\r\n     terms with men. It passed both Houses by a large majority vote,\r\n     but by some technicality, for which no one seemed to blame, it\r\n     was not legally started on its round to the vote of the people.\r\n     Hence the proposition to submit the amendment will be again\r\n     passed upon this year, and with every promise of success. We have\r\n     strong hopes of making our little commonwealth the banner State\r\n     in this grand step of progress.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Frederick A. Hinckley, makes a fitting\r\nmention of some of the noble women who have represented this\r\nmovement in his State:\r\n\r\n                                   PROVIDENCE, R. I., Sept. 14, 1885.\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIENDS: You ask for a few words from me concerning salient\r\n     points in the history of the woman suffrage movement in Rhode\r\n     Island. As you know, ours is a very small State--the smallest in\r\n     the Union--and has a very closely compacted population. With us\r\n     the manufacturing interest overshadows everything else,\r\n     representing large investments of capital. On the one hand we\r\n     have great accumulations of wealth by the few; on the other hand,\r\n     a large percentage of unskilled foreign labor. For good or for\r\n     ill we feel all those conservative influences which naturally\r\n     grow out of this two-fold condition. This accounts in the main,\r\n     for the Rhode Islander's extreme and exceptionally tenacious\r\n     regard for the institutions of his ancestors. This is why we have\r\n     the most limited suffrage of any State, many _men_ being debarred\r\n     from voting by reason of the property qualification still\r\n     required here of foreign-born citizens. Such a social atmosphere\r\n     is not favorable to the extension of the franchise, either to men\r\n     or women, and makes peculiarly necessary with us, the educational\r\n     process of a very large amount of moral agitation before much can\r\n     be expected in the way of political changes.\r\n\r\n     My own residence here dates back only to 1878, though before that\r\n     from my Massachusetts home I was somewhat familiar with\r\n     Rhode-Island people and laws. Our work has consisted of monthly\r\n     meetings, made up usually of an afternoon session for address and\r\n     discussion, followed by a social tea; of an annual State\r\n     convention in the city of Providence; and of petitioning the\r\n     legislature each year, with the appointment of the customary\r\n     committees and hearings. For many years the centre of the woman\r\n     movement with us has been the State association, and since my own\r\n     connection with that, the leader about whom we have all rallied,\r\n     has been your beloved friend and mine, Elizabeth B. Chace. Hers\r\n     is that clear conception of, and untiring devotion to principles,\r\n     which make invincible leadership, tide over all disaster, and\r\n     overcome all doubt. By her constant appearance before legislative\r\n     committees, her model newspaper articles which never fail to\r\n     command general attention even among those who would not think of\r\n     agreeing with her, and by her persistent fidelity to her sense of\r\n     duty in social life, she is the recognized head of our agitation\r\n     in Rhode Island. But she has not stood alone. She has been the\r\n     centre of a group of women whose names will always be associated\r\n     with our cause in this locality. Elizabeth K. Churchill lived and\r\n     died a faithful and successful worker. The Woman's Club in this\r\n     city was her child; temperance, suffrage, and the interests of\r\n     working-women were dear to her heart. She was independent in her\r\n     convictions, and true to herself, even when it compelled dissent\r\n     from the attitude of trusted leaders and friends, but her work on\r\n     the platform, in the press, and in society, made her life a tower\r\n     of strength to the woman's rights cause and her death a\r\n     lamentable loss. Another active leader in the work here, though\r\n     not a speaker, who has passed on since my residence in\r\n     Providence, was Susan B. P. Martin. I think those of us\r\n     accustomed to act with her always respected Mrs. Martin's\r\n     judgment and felt sure of her fidelity. What more can be said of\r\n     any one than that?\r\n\r\n     It is difficult to speak publicly of one's friends while living.\r\n     But no history of woman suffrage agitation in Rhode Island would\r\n     be complete which did not place among those ever to be relied on,\r\n     the names of Anna Garlin Spencer, Sarah E. H. Doyle, Anna E.\r\n     Aldrich and Fanny P. Palmer. Mrs. Spencer moved from the State\r\n     just as I came into it, but the influence of her logical mind was\r\n     left behind her and the loss of her quick womanly tact has been\r\n     keenly felt. Mrs. Doyle has long been chairman of the executive\r\n     committee of the association, Mrs. Aldrich a safe and trusted\r\n     counsellor, and Mrs. Palmer as member of the Providence school\r\n     committee, and more recently as president of the Woman's Club,\r\n     has rendered the cause eminent service.\r\n\r\n     If final victory seems farther off here than in some of the newer\r\n     States, as it certainly does, that is only the greater reason for\r\n     earnest, and ceaseless work. We know we are right, and be it\r\n     short or long I am sure we have all enlisted for the war.\r\n\r\n                    Always sincerely yours,      FREDERIC A. HINCKLEY.\r\n\r\nBelow is the last utterance of Senator Anthony on this question. In\r\nwriting to Susan B. Anthony, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n              UNITED STATES SENATE CHAMBER, WASHINGTON, March 4, 1884.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR COUSIN: I am honored by your invitation to address the\r\n     National Woman Suffrage Association at the convention to be held\r\n     in this city. I regret that it is not in my power to comply with\r\n     your complimentary request. The enfranchisement of woman is one\r\n     of those great reforms which will come with the progress of\r\n     civilization, and when it comes those who witness it will wonder\r\n     that it has been so long delayed. The main argument against it is\r\n     that the women themselves do not desire it. Many men do not\r\n     desire it, as is evidenced by their omission to exercise it, but\r\n     they are not therefore deprived of it. I do not understand that\r\n     you propose compulsory suffrage, although I am not sure that that\r\n     would not be for the public advantage as applied to both sexes. A\r\n     woman has a right to vote in a corporation of which she is a\r\n     stockholder, and that she does not generally exercise that right\r\n     is not an argument against the right itself. The progress that is\r\n     making in the direction of your efforts is satisfactory and\r\n     encouraging.\r\n\r\n                         Faithfully yours,              H. B. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\nSenator Anthony was one of the ever-to-be-remembered nine senators\r\nwho voted for woman suffrage on the floor of the United States\r\nSenate in 1866. He also made a most logical speech on our behalf\r\nand has ever since been true to our demands.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[171] To Mrs. Davis, a native of the State of New York, belongs the\r\nhonor of inaugurating this movement in New England, as she called\r\nand managed the first convention held in Massachusetts in 1850, and\r\nhelped to arouse all these States to action in 1868. With New\r\nEngland reformers slavery was always the preeminently pressing\r\nquestion, even after the emancipation of the slaves, while in New\r\nYork woman's civil and political rights were considered the more\r\nvital question.--[E.

Here, as in Vermont, the\r\nmen inaugurated the movement. The following letter, from the\r\n_Portland Press_, gives the initiative steps:\r\n\r\n                                        HIRAM, March 15, 1868.\r\n\r\n     MR. EDITOR: A statement is going the rounds of the press that the\r\n     Democrats of Hiram supported a lady for a member of the school\r\n     committee. I am unwilling that any person or party shall be\r\n     ridiculed or censured for an act of which I was the instigator,\r\n     and for which I am chiefly responsible. I am in favor of electing\r\n     ladies to that office, and accordingly voted for one, without her\r\n     knowledge or consent; several Democrats as well as Republicans\r\n     voted with me. I have reason to believe that scores of Democrats\r\n     voted for the able and popular candidate of the Republicans (Dr.\r\n     William H. Smith), and but for my peculiar notion I should have\r\n     voted for him myself, as I always vote with the Republican party.\r\n     I am in favor, however, of laying aside politics in voting for\r\n     school committees, and the question of capability should outweigh\r\n     the question of sex. A few years ago we had a large number of boy\r\n     schoolmasters, but agents are learning to appreciate teachers of\r\n     tact, experience and natural qualifications, as well as\r\n     book-knowledge. Of eleven schools under the care of the writer\r\n     the past year, but one had a male teacher, and by turning to the\r\n     reports I find that of forty-nine schools in Hiram during the\r\n     past two years, forty-two were taught by ladies. Four of these\r\n     teachers of the past year have taught respectively twenty,\r\n     twenty-one, twenty-three and thirty schools. I put the question,\r\n     why should a lady who has taught thirty schools be considered\r\n     less suitable for the office of school committee than the\r\n     undersigned, who has taught but two, or scores of men who never\r\n     taught school at all? Slowly and with hesitation over the ice of\r\n     prejudice comes that unreasonable reason--\"_O, 'cause._\" But\r\n     regardless of pants or crinoline, the question remains unanswered\r\n     and unanswerable. It is not deemed improper for the ladies of\r\n     Hiram to go with their husbands to the town-house to a cattle\r\n     show and fair, and serve as committees on butter and cheese, but\r\n     it is considered unreasonable for ladies to serve as\r\n     superintendents of school committees.\r\n\r\n     General Washington gave a lieutenant's commission to a woman for\r\n     her skill and bravery in manning a battery at the battle of\r\n     Monmouth. He also granted her half-pay during life. It is stated\r\n     in \"Lincoln's Lives of the Presidents\" that \"she wore an\r\n     epaulette, and everybody called her Captain Molly.\" And yet I do\r\n     not read in history that General Washington was ever impeached.\r\n     Females have more and better influence than males, and under\r\n     their instruction our schools have been improving for some years.\r\n     There is less kicking and cudgeling, and more attention is given\r\n     to that best of all rules, \"The Golden Rule.\" If they are more\r\n     efficient as teachers is it not fair to presume that they would\r\n     excel as committees?\r\n\r\n                         Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                               LLEWELLYN A. WADSWORTH.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _Press_ adds to the above his own endorsement, in\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n     We are pleased to have Mr. Wadsworth's explanation of the reform\r\n     movement in Hiram, which we had been misled into crediting to the\r\n     Democrats. * * * Go on, Mr. Wadsworth, you have our best wishes.\r\n     There is nothing in the way of the general adoption of your ideas\r\n     but a lot of antiquated and obsolete notions, sustained by the\r\n     laughter of fools.\r\n\r\nThe same year we have the report of the first suffrage society in\r\nthat State, which seems to place Maine in the van of her New\r\nEngland sisters, notwithstanding the great darkness our\r\ncorrespondent deplores:\r\n\r\n     DEAR REVOLUTION: A society has just been organized here called\r\n     the Equal Rights Association of Rockland. It bids fair to live,\r\n     although it requires all the courage of heroic souls to contend\r\n     against the darkness that envelopes the people. But the\r\n     foundation is laid, and many noble women are catching the\r\n     inspiration of the hour. When we are fully under way, we shall\r\n     send you a copy of our preamble and resolutions.\r\n\r\n                                   ELVIRA C. THORNDYKE, _Cor. Sec'y_.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John Neal, who was foremost in all good work in Maine, in\r\na letter to _The Revolution_, describes the first meeting called in\r\nPortland, in May, 1870, to consider the subject of suffrage for\r\nwoman. He says:\r\n\r\n     DEAR REVOLUTION: According to my promise, I sent an advertisement\r\n     to all three of our daily papers last Saturday, in substance like\r\n     the following, though somewhat varied in language:\r\n\r\n          ELEVATION OF WOMAN.--All who favor Woman Suffrage, the\r\n          Sixteenth Amendment, and the restoration of woman to her\r\n          \"natural and inalienable rights,\" are wanted for\r\n          consultation at the audience room of the Portland Institute\r\n          and Public Library, on Wednesday evening next, at half-past\r\n          seven o'clock. Per order\r\n\r\n                                                  JOHN NEAL.\r\n\r\n     The weather was unfavorable; nevertheless, the small room,\r\n     holding from sixty to seventy-five, to which the well-disposed\r\n     were invited for consultation and organization, was crowded so\r\n     that near the close not a seat could be had; and crowded, too,\r\n     with educated and intelligent women, and brave, thoughtful men,\r\n     so far as one might judge by appearances, and about in equal\r\n     proportions. Among the latter were Mr. Talbot, United States\r\n     district-attorney, a good lawyer and a self-convinced fellow\r\n     laborer, so far as suffrage is concerned; but rather unwilling to\r\n     go further at present, lest if a woman should be sent to the\r\n     legislature (against her will, of course!) she might neglect her\r\n     family, or be obliged to take her husband with her, to keep her\r\n     out of mischief; just as if Portland, with 35,000 inhabitants and\r\n     four representatives, would not be likely to find _two_ unmarried\r\n     women or widows, or married women not disqualified by matrimonial\r\n     incumbrances or liabilities, to represent the sex; or lest, if\r\n     she should get into the post-office, being by nature so curious\r\n     and inquisitive, she might be found peeping--as if the chief\r\n     distinction between superior and inferior minds was not this very\r\n     disposition to inquire and investigate; as if, indeed, that which\r\n     distinguishes the barbarous from the civilized, were not this\r\n     very inquisitiveness and curiosity; the savage being satisfied\r\n     with himself and averse to inquiry; the civilized ever on the\r\n     alert, in proportion to his intelligence, and, like the\r\n     Athenians, always on the look-out for some \"new thing.\"\r\n\r\n     And then, too, we had Judge Goddard, of the Superior Court, one\r\n     of our boldest and clearest thinkers, who could not be persuaded\r\n     to take a part in the discussion, though declaring himself\r\n     entirely opposed to the movement. And yet, he is the very man\r\n     who, at a Republican convention several years ago, offered a\r\n     resolution in favor of impartial suffrage, only to find himself\r\n     in a minority of two; but persevered nevertheless, year after\r\n     year, until the very same resolution, word for word, was\r\n     unanimously adopted by another Republican convention! Of course,\r\n     Judge Goddard will not be likely to shrink from giving his\r\n     reasons hereafter, if the movement should propagate itself, as it\r\n     certainly will.\r\n\r\n     We had also for consideration a synopsis of what deserves to be\r\n     called most emphatically \"The Maine Law,\" in relation to married\r\n     women, prepared by Mr. Drummond, our late speaker and formerly\r\n     attorney-general, and one of our best lawyers, where it was\r\n     demonstrated, both by enactments and adjudications, running from\r\n     March, 1844, to February, 1866, that a married woman--to say\r\n     nothing of widows and spinsters--has little to complain of in our\r\n     State, her legal rights being far ahead of the age, and not only\r\n     acknowledged, but enforced; she being mistress of herself and of\r\n     her earnings, and allowed to trade for herself, while \"her\r\n     contracts for any lawful purpose are made valid and binding, and\r\n     to be enforced, as if she were sole agent of her property, but\r\n     she cannot be arrested.\"\r\n\r\n     Then followed Mr. S. B. Beckett, just returned from a trip to the\r\n     Holy Land, who testified, among other things, that he had seen\r\n     women both in London and Ireland who knew \"how to keep a hotel,\"\r\n     which is reckoned among men as the highest earthly\r\n     qualification--and proved it by managing some of the largest and\r\n     best in the world.\r\n\r\n     And then Mr. Charles Jose, late one of our aldermen, who, half in\r\n     earnest and half in jest, took t'other side of the question,\r\n     urging, first, that this was a political movement--as if that\r\n     were any objection, supposing it true; our whole system of\r\n     government being a political movement, and that, by which we\r\n     trampled out the last great rebellion, another, both parties and\r\n     all parties cooeperating in the work; next, that women did not ask\r\n     for suffrage--it was the men who asked for it, in their names;\r\n     that there were no complaints and no petitions from women! As if\r\n     petitions had not gone up and complaints, too, by thousands, from\r\n     all parts of the country, from school-teachers and office clerks\r\n     and others, as well as from the women at large, both over sea and\r\n     here.\r\n\r\n     But enough. The meeting stands adjourned for a week. Probably no\r\n     organization will be attempted, lest it might serve to check free\r\n     discussion.\r\n\r\n                                                                 J. N.\r\n\r\n     _May 5, 1870._\r\n\r\nMr. W. W. McCann wrote to the _Woman's Journal_ of this suffrage\r\nmeeting in Portland, in 1870:\r\n\r\n     Judge Howe's voice, when he addressed the jury of Wyoming as\r\n     \"Ladies and Gentlemen of the Grand Jury,\" fell upon the ears of\r\n     that crowded court-room as a strange and unusual sound. Equally\r\n     strange and impracticable seemed the call for a \"woman suffrage\r\n     meeting,\" at the city building, to the conservative citizens of\r\n     Portland. However, notwithstanding the suspicion and prejudice\r\n     with which this movement is regarded, quite a large and highly\r\n     respectable audience assembled at an early hour to witness the\r\n     new and wonderful phenomenon of a meeting to aid in giving the\r\n     ballot to woman.\r\n\r\n     Hon. John Neal, who issued the call for the meeting, was the\r\n     first to speak. He reviewed the history of this movement, both in\r\n     this country and in England. He gave some entertaining\r\n     reminiscences of his acquaintance with John Stuart Mill forty\r\n     years ago. Mr. Mill was not then in favor of universal suffrage;\r\n     he advocated the enfranchisement of the male sex only. Mr. Neal\r\n     claimed the right for women also. He was happy to learn that\r\n     since then Mr. Mill has thrown all the weight of his influence\r\n     and his masterly intellect in favor of universal suffrage. He\r\n     then entered into an elaborate discussion of some of the\r\n     objections brought against woman suffrage, and, much to the\r\n     surprise of many present, showed that the rights which women\r\n     demand are just and reasonable, and ought to be granted. John M.\r\n     Todd remarked that he was not so much impressed by the logical\r\n     arguments in favor of suffrage as by the shallow and baseless\r\n     arguments of the opposition. The friends of woman suffrage are\r\n     becoming active and earnest in their efforts, and discussion is\r\n     freely going on through the daily papers.\r\n\r\n     To-day, the _Eastern Argus_, a leading Democratic organ of this\r\n     city, denounces this movement as the most \"damnable heresy of\r\n     this generation.\" We venture the prediction that its friends, if\r\n     true to the progressive tendencies of the day, will realize the\r\n     consummation of their cherished heresy in the proposed sixteenth\r\n     amendment, which will abolish all distinction of class and sex.\r\n\r\nOn August 12, 1871, the announcement that Colby University would be\r\nopened to girls gave general satisfaction to the women of Maine. A\r\ncorrespondent says:\r\n\r\n     Hereafter young women will be admitted to this institution on\r\n     \"precisely the same terms as young men.\" They may take the\r\n     regular course, or such a course as they may select, taking at\r\n     least two studies each term. They will room and board in families\r\n     in the village, and simply attend the required exercises at the\r\n     college. The next examination for entrance will be on Wednesday,\r\n     August 30. One young lady has already signified her purpose to\r\n     enter the regular course. Four New England colleges are now open\r\n     to women--Bates, at Lewiston; Colby, at Waterville, Me.; Vermont\r\n     University, at Burlington, Vt., and Wesleyan, at Middletown,\r\n     Conn. Let's have no more women's colleges established, for the\r\n     next decade will make them unnecessary, as by that time all the\r\n     colleges of the country will be opened to them.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 1872, another advance step was heralded abroad:\r\n\r\n     On motion of the Hon. James S. Milliken, Mrs. Clara Hapgood Nash,\r\n     of Columbia Falls, was formally admitted to the bar as an\r\n     attorney-at-law. During the session of the court in the forenoon,\r\n     Mrs. Nash had presented herself before the examining committee,\r\n     Messrs. Granger, Milliken and Walker, and had passed a more than\r\n     commonly creditable examination. After the opening of the court\r\n     in the afternoon, Mr. Milliken arose and said: \"May it please the\r\n     court, I hold in my hand papers showing that Mrs. Hapgood Nash,\r\n     of Columbia Falls, has passed the committee appointed by the\r\n     court to examine candidates for admission to the bar as\r\n     attorneys-at-law and has paid to the county treasurer the duty\r\n     required by the statute; and I now move the court that she be\r\n     admitted to this bar as an attorney-at-law. In making the motion\r\n     I am not unaware that this is a novel and unusual proceeding. It\r\n     is the first instance in this county and this State, and, so far\r\n     as I am aware, the first instance in New England, of the\r\n     application of a woman to be formally admitted to the bar as a\r\n     practitioner. But knowing Mrs. Nash to be a modest and refined\r\n     lady, of literary and legal attainments, I feel safe in assuring\r\n     Your Honor that by a course of honorable practice, and by her\r\n     courteous intercourse with the members of the profession, she\r\n     will do her full part to conquer any prejudice that may now exist\r\n     against the idea of women being admitted as attorneys at law.\"\r\n     Judge Barrows, after examining the papers handed to him, said: \"I\r\n     am not aware of anything in the constitution or laws of this\r\n     State prohibiting the admission of a woman, possessing the proper\r\n     qualifications, to the practice of the law. I have no sympathy\r\n     with that feeling or prejudice which would exclude women from\r\n     any of the occupations of life for which they may be qualified.\r\n     The papers put into my hands show that Mrs. Nash has received the\r\n     unanimous approval of the examining committee, as possessing the\r\n     qualifications requisite for an acceptable attorney, and that she\r\n     has paid the legal duty to the county treasurer, and I direct\r\n     that she be admitted.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 10, 1873, the trustees of the Industrial School for Girls\r\nissued the following appeal to the people of the State:\r\n\r\n     The undersigned, trustees of the Maine Industrial School for\r\n     Girls, hereby earnestly appeal to the generosity of the State, to\r\n     the rich and poor alike, for aid to this important movement. Our\r\n     call is to mothers and fathers blessed with virtuous and obedient\r\n     children; to those who have suffered by the waywardness of some\r\n     beloved daughter; and to all who would gladly see the neglected,\r\n     exposed and erring girls in our midst reclaimed. For six years\r\n     has this subject been agitated in the State and presented to the\r\n     consideration of several legislatures; and during that time the\r\n     objects, plans and practical workings of such an institution,\r\n     have become familiar to the public mind. The project is now so\r\n     near consummation that by prompt and liberal response to this\r\n     appeal, the school can be in active operation by the first of\r\n     July next.\r\n\r\n     By the terms of the resolution of the legislature granting State\r\n     aid of five thousand dollars, the sum of twenty thousand dollars\r\n     must first be secured from other sources. Of this, five thousand\r\n     at least has been contributed by two generous ladies in\r\n     Hallowell. For the balance the trustees confidentially look to\r\n     the citizens of the whole State as equally to be benefited. Let\r\n     them send their contributions, whether large or small, freely and\r\n     at once, to either of the undersigned and the receipt of the same\r\n     shall be duly acknowledged.[179]\r\n\r\nSome of the women tax-payers[180] in Ellsworth, Maine, sent the\r\nfollowing protest to the assessors of that city:\r\n\r\n     We the undersigned residents of the city of Ellsworth, believing\r\n     in the declaration of our forefathers, that \"governments derive\r\n     their just powers from the consent of the governed,\" and that\r\n     \"taxation without representation is tyranny,\" beg leave to\r\n     protest against being taxed for support of laws that we have no\r\n     voice in making. By taxing us you class us with aliens and\r\n     minors, the only males who are taxed and not allowed to vote, you\r\n     make us the political inferiors of the most ignorant foreigners,\r\n     negroes, and men who have not intellect enough to learn to write\r\n     their names, or to read the vote given them. Our property is at\r\n     the disposal of men who have not the ability to accumulate a\r\n     dollar's worth and who pay only a poll-tax. We therefore protest\r\n     against being taxed until we are allowed the rights of citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        AUGUSTA, March 1, 1872.\r\n\r\n     EDITORS WOMAN'S JOURNAL: I have never seen a letter in the\r\n     _Woman's Journal_ written from Augusta, the capital of Maine, and\r\n     as some things have transpired lately which might interest your\r\n     readers, I take the liberty of writing a few lines. The bill for\r\n     woman suffrage was defeated in the House, fifty-two to forty-one.\r\n     In the Senate the vote was fifteen in favor to eight against. I\r\n     think the smallness of the vote was owing to the indifference of\r\n     some of the members and the determination of a few to kill the\r\n     bill. Some politicians are afraid of this innovation just now,\r\n     lest the Republican party be more disrupted than it already is.\r\n     Day after day, when the session was drawing to a close, women\r\n     went to the state-house expecting to hear the question debated.\r\n     Wednesday every available place was filled with educated women.\r\n     The day was spent--if I should say how, my criticism might be too\r\n     severe. Gentlemen from Thomaston, Biddeford, Burlington and\r\n     Waldoborough had the floor most of the time during the afternoon.\r\n     In the evening, while those same women and some of the members of\r\n     the legislature were attending a concert, the bill was taken up\r\n     and voted upon, _without any discussion whatever_. Now, I submit\r\n     to any fair-minded person if this was right. I have listened to\r\n     discussions upon that floor this winter for which I should have\r\n     hung my head in shame had they been conducted by women. The whole\r\n     country, from Maine to California, calls loudly for better\r\n     legislation--for morality in politics.\r\n\r\n     A member of the House said to me yesterday, that he thought that\r\n     some of the members from the rural districts were not\r\n     sufficiently enlightened upon the question of woman suffrage, and\r\n     the bill ought to have been thoroughly discussed. Yes, and\r\n     perhaps treated with respect by its friends. I saw the member\r\n     from Calais while a vote was being taken. Standing in his seat,\r\n     with his hand stretched toward the rear of the House, where it is\r\n     generally supposed that members sit who are a little slow in\r\n     voting at the beck of politicians, he said: \"_Yes_ is the way to\r\n     vote, gentlemen! Yes! Yes!\" When women have such politicians for\r\n     champions equal suffrage is secured. But do we want such men? The\r\n     member from Calais voted against woman's right of suffrage. He is\r\n     said to be an ambitious aspirant in the fifth congressional\r\n     district. See to it, women of the fifth district, that you do not\r\n     have him as an opponent of equal rights in congress. There is a\r\n     throne behind a throne. Let woman be _regal_ in the background,\r\n     where she must stand for the present, in Maine.\r\n\r\n     But I am happy and proud to state that some very high-minded men,\r\n     and some of the best legislators in the House, did vote for the\r\n     bill, viz.: Brown of Bangor, Judge Titcomb of Augusta, General\r\n     Perry of Oxford, Porter of Burlington, Labroke of Foxcroft, and\r\n     many others; in the Senate, the president and fourteen others,\r\n     the real bone and marrow of the Senate, voted for the bill. The\r\n     signs of the times are good. The watchman of the night discerns\r\n     the morning light in the broad eastern horizon.\r\n\r\n                         [Signed:]      PATIENCE COMMONSENSE.\r\n\r\nThe _Portland Press_, in a summary of progress in Maine for 1873,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     Women certainly have no reason to complain of the year's dealings\r\n     with them, for they have been recognized in many ways which\r\n     indicate the gradual breaking down of the prejudices that have\r\n     hitherto given them a position of _quasi_ subjection. Mrs. Mary\r\n     D. Welcome has been licensed to preach by the Methodists; Mrs.\r\n     Fannie U. Roberts of Kittery has been commissioned by the\r\n     governor to solemnize marriages; Clara H. Nash, of the famous law\r\n     firm of F. C. & C. H. Nash, of Columbia Falls, has argued a case\r\n     before a jury in the Supreme Court; Miss Mary C. Lowe of Colby\r\n     University has taken a college prize for declamation. They are\r\n     the first Maine women who have ever enjoyed honors of the kind.\r\n     Miss Cameron spoke, too, at the last Congregational conference,\r\n     and Miss Frank Charles was appointed register of deeds in Oxford\r\n     county.\r\n\r\n     It is further to be noted that the legislature voted as follows\r\n     on the question of giving the ballot to women: Senate--14 yeas,\r\n     14 nays; House--62 yeas, 69 nays. Women are rapidly obtaining a\r\n     recognized position in our colleges. There are now five young\r\n     women at Colby, three at Bates, and three at the Agricultural\r\n     College--eleven in all. Bates has already graduated two. In the\r\n     latter college a scholarship for the benefit of women has been\r\n     endowed by Judge Reddington. Finally, the first Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association ever formed in Maine held its first meeting at\r\n     Augusta last January, and was a great success. Carmel, Monroe,\r\n     Etna and some other towns have elected women superintendents of\r\n     schools, but this has been done in other years. For a little\r\n     movement in the right direction we must credit Messrs. Amos,\r\n     Abbott & Co., woolen manufacturers of Dexter, who divide ten per\r\n     cent. of their profits with their operatives.\r\n\r\nClara H. Nash, the lady who, in partnership with her husband, has\r\nrecently entered upon the practice of law in Maine, says:\r\n\r\n     Scarcely a day passes but something occurs in our office to rouse\r\n     my indignation afresh by reminding me of the utter insignificance\r\n     with which the law, in its every department, regards woman, and\r\n     its utter disregard of her rights as an individual. Would that\r\n     women might feel this truth; then, indeed, would their\r\n     enfranchisement be speedy.\r\n\r\nIn the _Woman's Journal_ of January 1, 1873, we find the following\r\ncall:\r\n\r\n     The people of Maine who believe in the extension of the elective\r\n     franchise to women as a beneficent power for the promotion of the\r\n     virtues and the correction of the evils of society, and all who\r\n     believe in the principles of equal justice, equal liberty and\r\n     equal opportunity, upon which republican institutions are\r\n     founded, and have faith in the triumph of intelligence and reason\r\n     over custom and prejudice, are invited to meet at Granite Hall,\r\n     in the city of Augusta, on Wednesday, January 29, 1873, for the\r\n     purpose of organizing a State Woman Suffrage Association, and\r\n     inaugurating such measures for the advancement of the cause as\r\n     the wisdom of the convention may suggest.[181]\r\n\r\nThe _Portland Press_, in a leading editorial on the \"Moral Eminence\r\nof Maine,\" says:\r\n\r\n     Maine has been first in many things. She has taught the world how\r\n     to struggle with intemperance, and pilgrims come hither from all\r\n     quarters of the earth to learn the theory and practice of\r\n     prohibition. She was among the first to practically abolish\r\n     capital punishment and to give married women their rights in\r\n     respect to property. She is, perhaps, nearer giving them\r\n     political rights, also, than any of her sister commonwealths. If\r\n     Maine should be first among the States to give suffrage to women,\r\n     she would do more for temperance than a hundred prohibitory laws,\r\n     and more for civilization and progress than Massachusetts did\r\n     when she threw the tea into Boston harbor in 1773, or when she\r\n     sent the first regiment to the relief of Washington in 1861.\r\n\r\n     The leaders of the temperance reform in Maine are fully alive to\r\n     the necessity of woman suffrage as a means to that end. At the\r\n     meeting of the State Temperance Association of Maine, in Augusta,\r\n     recently, Mr. Randall said that \"as the woman suffrage convention\r\n     has adjourned over this afternoon in order to attend the\r\n     temperance meeting, he would move that when we adjourn it be to\r\n     Thursday morning, as the work at both conventions is intimately\r\n     connected. If the women of Maine went to the ballot-box, we\r\n     should have officers to enforce the law.\" Mr. Randall's motion\r\n     was carried, and the temperance convention adjourned.\r\n\r\nThe Woman Suffrage Association assembled Wednesday, January 29, in\r\nGranite Hall, Augusta. There was a very large attendance, a\r\nconsiderable number of those present being members of the\r\nlegislature. Hon. Joshua Nye presided. He made a few remarks\r\nrelating to the removal of political disabilities from women, and\r\nintroduced Mrs. Agnes A. Houghton of Bath, who spoke on the\r\n\"Turning of the Tide,\" contending that woman should be elevated\r\nsocially, politically and morally, enjoying the same rights as man.\r\nShe was followed by Judge Benjamin Kingsbury, jr., of Portland, who\r\ndeclared himself unequivocally in favor of giving woman the right\r\nto vote, and who trusted that she would be accorded this right by\r\nthe present legislature. More than 1,000 persons were in the\r\naudience, and great enthusiasm prevailed. The morning session was\r\ndevoted to business and the election of officers.[182] In order not\r\nto conflict with a meeting of the State Temperance Association, no\r\nafternoon session was held, and, in return, the State Temperance\r\nSociety gave up its evening meeting to enable its members to attend\r\nthe suffrage convention.\r\n\r\nSpeeches were made by Henry B. Blackwell of Boston, Rev. Ellen\r\nGustin of Mansfield, Mary Eastman of Lowell, and others.\r\nResolutions were passed pledging the association not to cease its\r\nefforts until the unjust discrimination with regard to voting is\r\nswept away; that in the election of president, and of all officers\r\nwhere the qualifications of voters are not prescribed by the State\r\nconstitution, the experiment should be tried of allowing women to\r\nvote; that in view of the large amount of money which has been\r\nexpended in Maine for the exclusive benefit of the Boys' Industrial\r\nSchool during the past twenty years, it is the prayer of the ladies\r\nof Maine that the present legislature vote the sum asked for the\r\nestablishment of an Industrial School for girls.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 we find notices of other onward steps:\r\n\r\n     EDITORS JOURNAL: Woman's cause works slowly here, though in one\r\n     respect we have been successful. Our county school-superintendent\r\n     is a lady. She had a large majority over our other candidate, and\r\n     over two gentlemen, and she is decidedly \"the right person in the\r\n     right place.\" She is a graduate from the normal school, the\r\n     mother of four children, a widow for some six years past, and a\r\n     lady. What more can we ask, unless, indeed, it be for a very\r\n     conscientious idea of duty? That, too, she has, and also energy,\r\n     with which she carries it out. The sterner sex admit that women\r\n     are competent to hold office. But some say we are not intelligent\r\n     enough to vote. What an appalling amount of wisdom they show in\r\n     this idea! It would be \"unwomanly\" in us to suggest such a word\r\n     as inconsistency.\r\n\r\n                                   Fraternally,               M. J.

The returns of town elections, so\r\n     far as I have yet seen, give three towns in the county which have\r\n     elected ladies[183] to serve as members of the school committee.\r\n\r\n                                                           L. J. Y. W.\r\n     _Houlton, Maine._\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1874 the governor and council requested the\r\nopinion of the Supreme Judicial Court on the following questions:\r\n\r\n     _First_--Under the constitution and laws of this State, can a\r\n     woman, if duly appointed and qualified as a justice of the peace,\r\n     legally perform all acts pertaining to that office?\r\n\r\n     _Second_--Would it be competent for the legislature to authorize\r\n     the appointment of a married woman to the office of justice of\r\n     the peace; or to administer oaths, take acknowledgment of deeds\r\n     or solemnize marriages, so that the same may be legal and valid?\r\n\r\nThe following responses to these inquiries were received by the\r\ngovernor: the opinion of the court, drawn by Chief-justice\r\nAppleton, and concurred in by Justices Cutting, Peters, Danforth\r\nand Virgin; a dissenting opinion from Justices Walton and Barrows\r\nand one from Justice Dickerson. The opinion of the court is given\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\n     To the questions proposed we have the honor to answer as follows:\r\n\r\n     Whether it is expedient that women should hold the office of\r\n     justice of the peace is not an inquiry proposed for our\r\n     consideration. It is whether, under the existing constitution,\r\n     they can be appointed to such office, and can legally discharge\r\n     its duties.\r\n\r\n     By the constitution of Massachusetts, of which we formerly\r\n     constituted a portion, the entire political power of that\r\n     commonwealth was vested under certain conditions, in its male\r\n     inhabitants of a prescribed age. They alone, and in the exclusion\r\n     of the other sex, as determined by its highest court of law,\r\n     could exercise the judicial function as existing and established\r\n     by that instrument.\r\n\r\n     By the act relating to the separation of the district of Maine\r\n     from Massachusetts, the authority to determine upon the question\r\n     of separation, and to elect delegates to meet and form a\r\n     constitution was conferred upon the \"inhabitants of the several\r\n     towns, districts and plantations in the district of Maine\r\n     qualified to vote for governor or senators,\" thus excluding the\r\n     female sex from all participation in the formation of the\r\n     constitution, and in the organization of the government under it.\r\n     Whether the constitution should or should not be adopted, was\r\n     especially, by the organic law of its existence, submitted to the\r\n     vote of the male inhabitants of the State.\r\n\r\n     It thus appears that the constitution of the State was the work\r\n     of its male citizens. It was ordained, established, and ratified\r\n     by them, and by them alone; but by the power of government was\r\n     divided into three distinct departments: legislative, executive\r\n     and judicial. By article VI., section 4, justices of the peace\r\n     are recognized as judicial officers.\r\n\r\n     By the constitution, the whole political power of the State is\r\n     vested in its male citizens. Whenever in any of its provisions,\r\n     reference is made to sex, it is to duties to be done and\r\n     performed by male members of the community. Nothing in the\r\n     language of the constitution or in the debates of the convention\r\n     by which it was formed, indicates any purpose whatever of any\r\n     surrender of political power by those who had previously enjoyed\r\n     it or a transfer of the same to those who had never possessed it.\r\n     Had any such design then existed, we cannot doubt that it would\r\n     have been made manifest in appropriate language. But such\r\n     intention is nowhere disclosed. Having regard then, to the rules\r\n     of the common law as to the rights of women, married and\r\n     unmarried, as then existing--to the history of the past--to the\r\n     universal and unbroken practical construction given to the\r\n     constitution of this State and to that of the Commonwealth of\r\n     Massachusetts upon which that of this State was modeled, we are\r\n     led to the inevitable conclusion that it was never in the\r\n     contemplation or intention of those framing our constitution that\r\n     the offices thereby created should be filled by those who could\r\n     take no part in its original formation, and to whom no political\r\n     power was intrusted for the organization of the government then\r\n     about to be established under its provisions, or for its\r\n     continued existence and preservation when established.\r\n\r\n     The same process of reasoning which would sanction the conferring\r\n     judicial power on women under the constitution would authorize\r\n     the giving them executive power by making them sheriffs and\r\n     major-generals. But while the offices enacted by the constitution\r\n     are to be filled exclusively by the male members of the State, we\r\n     have no doubt that the legislature may create new ministerial\r\n     offices not enumerated therein, and if it deem expedient, may\r\n     authorize the performance of the duties of the offices so created\r\n     by persons of either sex.\r\n\r\n     To the _first_ question proposed, we answer in the negative.\r\n\r\n     To the _second_, we answer that it is competent for the\r\n     legislature to authorize the appointment of married or unmarried\r\n     women to administer oaths, take acknowledgment of deeds or\r\n     solemnize marriages, so that the same shall be legal and valid.\r\n\r\n                         JOHN APPLETON,       JOHN A. PETERS,\r\n                         JONAS CUTTING,       WM. WIRT VIRGIN,\r\n                                   CHARLES DANFORTH.\r\n\r\nThe dissenting opinion was as follows:\r\n\r\n     We, the undersigned, Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court,\r\n     concur in so much of the foregoing opinion as holds that it is\r\n     competent for the legislature to authorize the appointment of\r\n     women to administer oaths, take the acknowledgment of deeds and\r\n     solemnize marriages. But we do not concur in the conclusion that\r\n     it is not equally competent for the legislature to authorize the\r\n     appointment of women to act as justices of the peace.\r\n\r\n     The legislature is authorized to enact any law which it deems\r\n     reasonable and proper, provided it is not repugnant to the\r\n     constitution of this State, nor to that of the United States. A\r\n     law authorizing the appointment of women to act as justices of\r\n     the peace would not, in our judgment, be repugnant to either. We\r\n     fail to find a single word, or sentence, or clause of a sentence,\r\n     which, fairly construed, either expressly or impliedly forbids\r\n     the passage of such a law. So far as the office of justice of the\r\n     peace is concerned, there is not so much as a masculine pronoun\r\n     to hang an objection upon.\r\n\r\n     It is true that the right to vote is limited to males. But the\r\n     right to vote and the right to hold office are distinct matters.\r\n     Either may exist without the other. And it may be true that the\r\n     framers of the constitution did not contemplate--did not\r\n     affirmatively intend--that women should hold office. But it by no\r\n     means follows that they intended the contrary. The truth probably\r\n     is that they had no intention one way or the other; that the\r\n     matter was not even thought of. And it will be noticed that the\r\n     unconstitutionality of such a law is made to rest, not on any\r\n     expressed intention of the framers of the constitution that women\r\n     should not hold office, but upon a presumed absence of intention\r\n     that they should.\r\n\r\n     This seems to us a dangerous doctrine. It is nothing less than\r\n     holding that the legislature cannot enact a law unless it appears\r\n     affirmatively that the framers of the constitution intended that\r\n     such a law should be enacted. We cannot concur in such a\r\n     doctrine. It would put a stop to all progress. We understand the\r\n     correct rule to be the reverse of that; namely, that the\r\n     legislature may enact any law they may think proper, unless it\r\n     appears affirmatively that the framers of the constitution\r\n     intended that such a law should not be passed. And the best and\r\n     only safe rule for ascertaining the intention of the makers of\r\n     any written law, is to abide by the language which they have\r\n     used. And this is especially true of written constitutions; for\r\n     in preparing such instruments it is but reasonable to presume\r\n     that every word has been carefully weighed, and that none is\r\n     inserted and none omitted without a design for so doing. Taking\r\n     this rule for our guide we can find nothing in the constitution\r\n     of the United States, or of this State, forbidding the passage of\r\n     a law authorizing the appointment of women to act as justices of\r\n     the peace. We think such a law would be valid.\r\n\r\n                                             C. W. WALTON,\r\n                                             WM. G. BARROWS.\r\n\r\nThe right of women to hold office was affirmed in the message of\r\nGovernor Dingley, January, 1875:\r\n\r\n     In response to the questions propounded by the governor and\r\n     council, a majority of the justices of the Supreme Court have\r\n     given an opinion that, under the constitution of Maine, women\r\n     cannot act as justices of the peace, nor hold any other office\r\n     mentioned in that instrument; but that it is competent for the\r\n     legislature to authorize persons of either sex to hold any\r\n     ministerial office created by statute. As there can be no valid\r\n     objection to, but on the contrary great convenience in, having\r\n     women who may be acting as clerks in public or private offices\r\n     authorized to administer oaths and take acknowledgment of deeds,\r\n     I recommend the passage of an act providing for the appointment\r\n     of persons of either sex, to perform such official duties.\r\n     Indeed, if further legislation be necessary to establish that\r\n     principle, I suggest the justice and expediency of an enabling\r\n     act recognizing the eligibility of women to office in the same\r\n     manner as men; for I know of no sufficient reason why a woman,\r\n     otherwise qualified, should be excluded from any position adapted\r\n     to her tastes and acquirements, which the people may desire she\r\n     should fill.\r\n\r\nThe legislature passed the bill recommended by the governor.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the Constitutional Committee, by a vote of six to two,\r\ndefeated the proposition to so amend the constitution as to make\r\nwomen electors under the same regulations and restrictions as men.\r\n\r\n     The Maine Woman Suffrage Association held its third annual\r\n     meeting at Augusta on January 12, 1876, in the hall of the House\r\n     of Representatives, the use of which had been courteously\r\n     extended to the association. The hall and galleries were crowded\r\n     in every part with an intelligent audience, whose close attention\r\n     through all the sessions showed an earnest interest in the cause.\r\n\r\n     The meeting was called to order by Judge Kingsbury of Portland,\r\n     president of the association.[184] Prayer was offered by Miss\r\n     Angell of Canton, N. Y. Judge Kingsbury made the introductory\r\n     address. Addresses were also made by H. B. Blackwell, Miss\r\n     Eastman and Lucy Stone, showing the right and need of women in\r\n     politics, and the duty of law-makers to establish justice for\r\n     them. It was especially urged that the centennial celebration\r\n     would be only a mockery if the Fourth of July, 1876, finds this\r\n     government still doing to women what the British government did\r\n     to the colonists a hundred years ago. Rev. Mr. Gage of Lewiston\r\n     urged the right of women to vote in the interest of civilization\r\n     itself. In the perilous times upon which we have fallen in the\r\n     great experiment of self-government, some new force is needed to\r\n     check growing evils. The influence in the home is that which is\r\n     needed in legislation, and it can only be had by the ballot in\r\n     the hand of woman. Mrs. Quinby, from the Business Committee,\r\n     reported a series of resolutions. After their adoption Mrs. Abba\r\n     G. Woolson, in an earnest and forcible speech, claimed the right\r\n     of women to vote, as the final application of the theory of the\r\n     consent of the governed. She had personally noticed the good\r\n     effects of the ballot conferred upon the women in Wyoming, and\r\n     should be glad to have her native State of Maine lead in this\r\n     matter, and give an illustration of the true republic. Miss\r\n     Lorenza Haynes, who had been the day before ordained over the\r\n     Universalist Church in Hallowell, followed with a speech of\r\n     remarkable wit and brilliancy, to which no report can do justice.\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Woman's Journal_ about this time said:\r\n\r\n     During the early part of the session of our late legislature\r\n     woman suffrage petitions were numerously signed by the leading\r\n     men and women throughout the State receiving an earnest and\r\n     respectful consideration from the people generally, even from\r\n     those who were not quite ready to sign petitions. Consequently,\r\n     it seemed an easy matter to get a bill before the legislature,\r\n     and we were almost certain of a majority in one branch of the\r\n     House, at least, especially as it was generally understood that\r\n     our new governor favored the cause; and it is believed yet that\r\n     Governor Dingley does sympathize with it, even though he failed\r\n     to mention it in his otherwise admirable message. The petitions\r\n     were duly presented and referred to a joint committee, where the\r\n     matter was allowed to quietly drop.\r\n\r\n     It is neither riches, knowledge, nor culture that constitutes the\r\n     electoral qualifications, but gender and a certain implied brute\r\n     force. By this standard legislative bodies have been wont to\r\n     judge the exigency of this mighty question. More influential than\r\n     woman, though unacknowledged as such by the average legislator of\r\n     States and nations, even the insignificant lobster finds earnest\r\n     champions where woman's claims fail of recognition; which\r\n     assertion the following incident will substantiate: Being present\r\n     in the Representatives Hall in Augusta when the \"lobster\r\n     question\" came up for discussion (the suffrage question was then\r\n     struggling before the committee), I was struck by the air of\r\n     earnestness that pervaded the entire House on that memorable\r\n     occasion. And why not? It was a question that appealed directly\r\n     to man's appetite, and there he is always interested. After the\r\n     morning hour a dozen ready debators sprang to their feet,\r\n     eloquent in advocating the rights of this important member of the\r\n     crustacean family. The discussion waxed into something like\r\n     enthusiasm, when finally an old tar exclaimed with terrific\r\n     violence: \"Mr. Speaker, I insist upon it, this question must be\r\n     considered. It is a great question; one before which all others\r\n     will sink into insignificance; one of vastly more importance than\r\n     any other that will come before this honorable body during this\r\n     session!\"\r\n\r\n                                                    DIRIGO.\r\n\r\nIn closing this chapter it is fitting to mention some of our\r\nfaithful friends in Maine, whose names have not appeared in\r\nsocieties and conventions as leaders or speakers, but whose\r\nservices in other ways have been highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nRockland is the home of Lucy and Lavinia Snow, who, from the\r\norganization of the first society in 1868, have never failed to\r\nsend good words of cheer and liberal contributions to all our\r\nNational conventions. Another branch of the worthy Snow family,\r\nfrom the town of Hamlin, has given us equally generous coaedjutors\r\nin Mrs. Spofford and her noble sisters in Washington.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1857, Mrs. Anna Greeley and Miss Charlotte Hill of\r\nEllsworth constituted themselves a committee to inaugurate a course\r\nof lyceum lectures in that town, taking the entire financial\r\nresponsibility. Miss Hill was an excellent violinist and taught a\r\nlarge class of boys and girls, and also played at balls and\r\nparties, thus gaining a livelihood. Some of her patrons threatened\r\nthat if she persisted in bringing such people[185] to that town and\r\naffiliated with them, they would no longer patronize her. \"Very\r\nwell\" she replied, \"I shall maintain my principles, and if you\r\nbreak up my classes I can go back to the sea-shore and dig clams\r\nfor a living as I have done before.\" Tradition says the lecture\r\ncourse was a success. She continued her classes and the neighbors\r\ndanced as ever to her music.\r\n\r\nGail Hamilton, who resides in Maine at least half her time, is one\r\nof the most brilliant and pungent American writers. In denouncing\r\nthe follies and failures of her sex, her critical pen has\r\nindirectly aided the suffrage movement by arousing thought upon all\r\nphases of the question as to what are the rights and duties of\r\nwoman, though she stoutly maintains that she is opposed to woman's\r\nenfranchisement.\r\n\r\nIn Portland there has always been a circle of noble men and women,\r\nsteadfast friends alike of the anti-slavery, temperance and woman\r\nsuffrage movements. The names of Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Dennett, Miss.\r\nCharlotte A. Thomas and Mrs. Ellen French Foster are worthy of\r\nmention. That untiring reformer, the Hon. Neal Dow, has clearly\r\nseen and declared in the later years of his labors, that suffrage\r\nfor women is the short path to the advancement of prohibition.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Thomas B. Reed has done us great service in congress as\r\nleader of the Republican party in the House, and member of the\r\nJudiciary Committee. His report,[186] in 1884, on the submission of\r\nthe sixteenth amendment has had an extended influence. It is an\r\nable argument, and as a keen piece of irony it is worthy the pen of\r\na Dean Swift. In the Senate we have a fast friend in William P.\r\nFrye, who has always voted favorably in both houses on all\r\nquestions regarding the interests of woman. In 1878, in presenting\r\nMiss Willard's petition of 30,000 for woman's right to vote on the\r\ntemperance question, he made an able speech recommending the\r\nmeasure.[187]\r\n\r\nAnd in closing, the name of Maine's venerable statesman, Hannibal\r\nHamlin, so long honored by his State in a succession of official\r\npositions from year to year, must not be forgotten. As chairman of\r\nthe Committee on the District of Columbia in 1870 he presided at\r\nthe first hearing of the National Woman Suffrage Association,\r\nlistened with respect and courtesy, and at the close introduced the\r\nladies to each member of the committee, and said \"he had been\r\ndeeply impressed by the arguments, and was almost persuaded to\r\naccept the new gospel of woman's equality.\" Mr. Hamlin's vote has\r\nalways been favorable and we have no words of his recorded in the\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nHon. James G. Blaine has generally maintained a dignified silence\r\non the question. Thus far in his History, a reviewer says, \"he has\r\nignored the existence of woman\"; but perhaps in his researches he\r\nhas not yet reached the garden of Eden, nor taken cognizance of the\r\npart the daughters of Eve have played in the rise and fall of\r\nmighty nations.\r\n\r\nNevertheless in our prolonged struggle of half a century for equal\r\nrights for woman, we have found in every State the traditional ten\r\nrighteous men necessary to save its people from destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[179] Signed: _President_, Benj.

Rogers--First Organized Action, 1868--Concord\r\n     Convention--William Lloyd Garrison's Letter--Rev. S. L. Blake\r\n     Opposed--Rev. Mr. Sanborn in Favor--_Concord Monitor_--Armenia S.\r\n     White--A Bill to Protect the Rights of Married Men--Minority and\r\n     Majority Reports--Women too Ignorant to Vote--Republican State\r\n     Convention--Women on School Committees--Voting at School-District\r\n     Meetings--Mrs. White's Address--Mrs. Ricker on Prison\r\n     Reform--Judicial Decision in Regard to Married Women,\r\n     1882--Letter from Senator Blair.\r\n\r\n\r\nA State that could boast four such remarkable families as the\r\nRogers, the Hutchinsons, the Fosters, and the Pillsburys, all\r\nradical, outspoken reformers, furnishes abundant reason for its\r\nprolonged battles with the natural conservatism of ordinary\r\ncommunities. Every inch of its soil except its mountain tops, where\r\nno man could raise a school-house for a meeting, has been overrun\r\nby the apostles of peace, temperance, anti-slavery, and woman's\r\nrights in succession.\r\n\r\nTo the early influence of Nathaniel P. Rogers and his revolutionary\r\njournal, _The Herald of Freedom_, we may trace the general\r\nawakening of the true men and women of that State to new ideas of\r\nindividual liberty. But while some gladly accepted his words as\r\nharbingers of a new and better civilization, others resisted all\r\ninnovations of their time-honored customs and opinions. And when\r\nthe clarion voices of Foster and Pillsbury arraigned that State for\r\nits compromises with slavery, howling mobs answered their arguments\r\nwith brickbats and curses; mobs that nothing could quell but the\r\nsweet voices of the Hutchinson family. Their peans of liberty, so\r\nreadily accepted when set to music, were obstinately resisted when\r\nuttered by others, though in most eloquent speech. Thus with music,\r\nmeetings and mobs, New Hampshire was at least awake and watching,\r\nand when the distant echoes of woman's uprising reverberated\r\nthrough her mountains she gave a ready response.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, simultaneously with other New England States, she felt the\r\ntime had come to organize for action on the question of suffrage\r\nfor women. A call for a convention was issued to be held in\r\nConcord, December 22, 23, and signed by one hundred and twenty men\r\nand women,[188] some of the most honored and influential classes of\r\nall callings and professions. Nathaniel P. White, always ready to\r\naid genuine reformatory movements, was the first to sign the call.\r\nAs a member of the legislature he had helped to coin into law many\r\nof the liberal ideas sown broadcast in the early days[189] by the\r\nanti-slavery apostles. Galen Foster, a brother of Stephen, used his\r\ninfluence also as a member of the legislature, to vindicate the\r\nrights of women to civil and political equality. This first\r\nconvention was held in Eagle Hall, Concord, with large and\r\nenthusiastic audiences. A long and interesting letter was read from\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison:\r\n\r\n                                   BOSTON, December 21, 1868.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MRS. WHITE: I must lose the gratification of being present\r\n     at the Woman Suffrage Convention at Concord and substitute an\r\n     epistolary testimony for a speech from the platform.\r\n\r\n     The two conventions recently held in furtherance of the movement\r\n     for universal and impartial suffrage--one in Boston, the other in\r\n     Providence--were eminently successful in respect to numbers,\r\n     intellectual ability, moral strength and unity of action; and\r\n     their proceedings such as to challenge attention and elicit\r\n     wide-spread commendation. I have no doubt that the convention in\r\n     Concord will exhibit the same features, be animated by the same\r\n     hopeful spirit and produce as cheering results.\r\n\r\n     The only criticism seemingly of a disparaging tone, I have seen,\r\n     of the speeches made at the conventions alluded to, is, that\r\n     there was nothing new advanced on the occasion; as though novelty\r\n     were the main thing, and the reiteration of time-honored truths,\r\n     with their latest application to the duties of the hour, were\r\n     simply tedious! For one, I ask no more light upon the subject;\r\n     nor am I so vain as to assume to be capable of throwing any\r\n     additional light upon it. One drop of water is very like another,\r\n     but it is the perpetual dropping that wears away the stone. The\r\n     importunate widow had nothing fresh or new to present to the\r\n     unjust judge, but by her persistent coming she wearied him into\r\n     compliance with her petition. The end of the constant assertion\r\n     of a right withheld is restitution and victory. The whole\r\n     anti-slavery controversy was expressed and included in the Golden\r\n     Rule, morally, and in the Declaration of Independence,\r\n     politically; nor could anything new be added to these by the\r\n     wisest, the most ingenious, or the most eloquent. \"Line upon\r\n     line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little\";\r\n     that is the essential method of reform. If there is nothing new\r\n     to be said in favor of suffrage for women, is there anything new\r\n     to be urged against it? But though the objections are exceedingly\r\n     trite and shallow, it is still necessary to examine and refute\r\n     them by arguments and illustrations none the less forcible\r\n     because exhausted at an earlier period.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Armenia S. White]\r\n\r\n\r\n     The first objection is positively one of the most urgent reasons\r\n     for granting suffrage to women; for it is predicated on the\r\n     concession of the superiority of woman over man in purity of\r\n     purpose and excellence of character. Hence the cry is, that it\r\n     will not only be descending, but degrading for her to appear at\r\n     the polls. But, if government is absolutely necessary, and voting\r\n     not wrong in practice, it is surely desirable that the admittedly\r\n     purest and best in the nation should find no obstacle to their\r\n     reaching the ballot-box. Nay, the way should be opened at once,\r\n     by every consideration pertaining to the public welfare, the\r\n     justice of legislation, the preservation of popular liberty. It\r\n     is impossible for a portion of the people, to be wiser and more\r\n     trustworthy than the whole people, or better qualified to decide\r\n     what shall be the laws for the government of all. The more minds\r\n     consulted, the more souls included, the more interests at stake,\r\n     in determining the form and administration of government, the\r\n     more of justice and humanity, of security and repose, will be the\r\n     result. The exclusion of half the population from the polls, is\r\n     not merely a gross injustice, but an immense loss of brain and\r\n     conscience, in making up the public judgment. As a nation we have\r\n     discarded absolutism, monarchy, and hereditary aristocracy; but\r\n     we have not fully attained even to manhood suffrage. Men are\r\n     proscribed on account of their complexion, women because of their\r\n     sex. The entire body politic suffers from this proscription.\r\n\r\n     The second objection refutes the first; it is based on the\r\n     alleged natural inferiority of woman to man, and the transition\r\n     is thus quickly made for her, from a semi-angelic state, to that\r\n     of a menial, having no rights that men are bound to respect\r\n     beyond what they choose to allow. In the scale of political\r\n     power, therefore, one male voter, however ignorant or depraved,\r\n     outweighs all the women in America! For, no matter how\r\n     intelligent, cultured, refined, wealthy, intellectually vigorous,\r\n     or morally great, any of their number may be,--no matter what\r\n     rank in literature, art, science, or medical knowledge and skill\r\n     they may reach,--they are political non-entities, unrepresented,\r\n     discarded, and left to such protection under the laws, as brute\r\n     force and absolute usurpation may graciously condescend to give.\r\n     Yet they are as freely taxed and held amendable to penal law as\r\n     strictly as though they had their full share of representation in\r\n     the legislative hall, on the bench, in the jury-box, and at the\r\n     polls. This cry of inferiority is not peculiar in the case of\r\n     woman. It was the subterfuge and defiance of negro slavery. It\r\n     has been raised in all ages by tyrants and usurpers against the\r\n     toiling, over-burdened millions, seeking redress for their\r\n     wrongs, and protection for their rights. It always indicates\r\n     intense self-conceit, and supreme selfishness. It is at war with\r\n     reason and common-sense, and is a bold denial of the oneness of\r\n     the human race.\r\n\r\n     The third objection is, that women do not wish to vote. If this\r\n     were true, it would not follow that they should not be\r\n     enfranchised, and left free to determine the matter for\r\n     themselves. It was confidently declared that the slaves at the\r\n     south neither wished to be free, nor would they take their\r\n     liberty if offered them by their masters. Had that assertion been\r\n     true, it would have furnished no justification whatever, for\r\n     making man the property of his fellow-man, or for leaving the\r\n     slaves in their fetters. But it was not true. Nor is it true that\r\n     women do not wish to vote. Tens of thousands are ready to go to\r\n     the polls and assume their share of political responsibility, as\r\n     soon as they shall be legally permitted to do so; and they are\r\n     not the ignorant and degraded of their sex, but women remarkable\r\n     for their intelligence and moral worth. The great mass will, ere\r\n     long, be sufficiently enlightened to claim what belongs to them\r\n     of right. I hope to be permitted to live to see the day when\r\n     neither complexion nor sex shall be made a badge of degradation,\r\n     but men and women shall enjoy the same rights and privileges, and\r\n     possess the same means for their protection and defense.\r\n\r\n                    Very faithfully yours,         WM. LLOYD GARRISON.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. A. S. WHITE.\r\n\r\nAt the close of this convention a State association was formed with\r\nMrs. Armenia S. White president.[190] This society has been\r\nunremitting in its efforts to rouse popular thought, holding annual\r\nconventions, scattering tracts, rolling up petitions, and\r\naddressing legislatures. Many of the best speakers, from time to\r\ntime, from other States[191] have rendered valuable aid in keeping\r\nup the agitation.\r\n\r\nThe opposition of a clergyman produced a sensation in Concord.\r\n\r\n     On last fast-day, 1871, Rev. S.L. Blake of the Congregational\r\n     church in Concord, preached a sermon in which he came out against\r\n     the woman's rights convention held there last January, bringing\r\n     the stale charge of \"free-love\" against its advocates--a charge\r\n     that always leaps to the lips of men of prurient\r\n     imagination--with much similar clap-trap of the Fulton type. Rev.\r\n     Mr. Sanborn of the Universalist church replied to him the next\r\n     Sunday evening, an immense audience being in attendance, and\r\n     completely disproved the baseless allegations of the reverend\r\n     maligner, to the satisfaction of all. Rev. Mr. Blake has\r\n     published his discourse in pamphlet form, repeating his disproved\r\n     charges, whereupon Rev. J.F. Lovering of the Unitarian church\r\n     came out with a reply, in which he characterized Mr. Blake's\r\n     charges as \"unmitigated falsehoods\" and \"an insult to every\r\n     member of the convention,\" and demanded of the author to \"unsay\r\n     his words.\"\r\n\r\nBrainard Cogswell, in his journal, the _Concord Monitor_, of July\r\n2, 1870, published the following letter:\r\n\r\n     Petitions for woman's enfranchisement have been pouring into the\r\n     New Hampshire legislature, until at last they have been referred\r\n     to a special committee. On Thursday week this committee gave the\r\n     petitioners a hearing; and on their invitation, Mrs. Julia Ward\r\n     Howe, Mrs. Elizabeth K. Churchill and ourself went to Concord to\r\n     give \"the reasons why\" women should have the ballot. The members\r\n     of the legislature came out in force to hear, and our good, tried\r\n     friends, Nathaniel and Armenia White, learning their intention in\r\n     advance, opened the spacious Eagle Hall for their convenience,\r\n     and that of the towns-people who wished to see and to hear. Warm\r\n     as the evening was, the thermometer up in the nineties, the hall\r\n     was packed, and great numbers went away that could not gain\r\n     admittance. Rev. Mr. Blake, a Congregationalist minister of\r\n     Concord, has done the cause good service by vilifying and abusing\r\n     it, until he roused quite an interest. It was partly owing to his\r\n     efforts that we had so grand an audience.\r\n\r\n     General Wilson, who twenty years ago was famed throughout New\r\n     Hampshire for his eloquence and oratory, was chairman of the\r\n     committee, and presided at the meeting, and very handsomely\r\n     introduced the speakers. Mrs. Howe spoke with more pointed and\r\n     pungent power than usual, dwelling on the deterioration of\r\n     American womanhood, showing the cause, and suggesting the remedy.\r\n     We have never been so impressed by her as on this occasion. Mrs.\r\n     Churchill read a letter from Rev. Mr. Savage, a Congregationalist\r\n     clergyman of the State, who advocates woman suffrage, and who, in\r\n     a late ministerial gathering, took up the gauntlet thrown down by\r\n     Mr. Blake, and defended the woman's cause and its advocates from\r\n     the slanders of his brother minister.\r\n\r\nThe president of the New Hampshire association, in writing from\r\nConcord to the _Woman's Journal_, January 30, 1871, says:\r\n\r\n     Our second annual meeting was a grand success, if we count by\r\n     money and numbers. The intense cold on Wednesday and Thursday\r\n     made our audiences thinner than heretofore, but they were large\r\n     in spite of the elements, Mrs. Churchill and Mrs. Emma Coe Still,\r\n     who had never presented the subject here before, were well\r\n     received. Rev. Dr. Savage of Franklin made an excellent address,\r\n     and encouraged us by timely suggestions. Stephen S. Foster\r\n     aroused us, as he always does, with his bold declarations. The\r\n     resolutions adopted look toward future work, and embody the\r\n     principles which move us to act.\r\n\r\nLucy Stone, in the _Woman's Journal_ of June 14, 1871, says:\r\n\r\n     The Select Committee, Harry Bingham, chairman, to whom was\r\n     referred a bill for the further protection of the rights of\r\n     married men, reported the bill in a new draft as follows:\r\n\r\n          Marriages shall not hereafter render the husband liable for\r\n          the debts contracted by his wife prior to their marriage:\r\n          _Second section_--No marriage shall hereafter discharge the\r\n          wife from liability to pay the debts contracted by her\r\n          before such marriage, but she, and all property which she\r\n          may hold in her own right, shall be held liable for the\r\n          payment of all debts, whether contracted before or after\r\n          marriage; in the same manner as if she continued sole and\r\n          unmarried.\r\n\r\n     This report was signed by eight of the ten members of the\r\n     committee. The minority, through Mr. Sprague of Swanzey, made a\r\n     report recommending that the whole subject be postponed to the\r\n     time when women in New Hampshire have the right to vote. Mr.\r\n     Sprague moved that the minority report be substituted for the\r\n     majority, but the motion was lost by an almost unanimous vote.\r\n     The majority report was sustained in remarks by Messrs. Wadleigh\r\n     of Milford and Cogswell of Gilman. The latter, hard pushed by an\r\n     interrogatory concerning his social status, admitted that he was\r\n     not married, but intended to be soon. The bill reported by the\r\n     majority was then ordered to a second reading.\r\n\r\n     If this action should be sustained by the legislature, we can\r\n     imagine some future suitor for a lady's hand telling her that he\r\n     shall expect her duly to keep his house and his wardrobe in\r\n     order, to prepare his meals, to entertain his visitors, to bear\r\n     his children, and that she will be required by law to pay her own\r\n     bills; that for this inestimable privilege she shall be called\r\n     Mrs. John Snooks, and may, perhaps, have the honor of being\r\n     written in the newspapers, and on her tombstone, as the relic of\r\n     Mr. John Snooks. Could any woman withstand that?\r\n\r\nThe following statistics have been used by speakers in the\r\nopposition, to show that women are too ignorant to vote:\r\n\r\n     A decided sensation has been produced throughout the country by\r\n     the publication in the third number of the \"Transactions of the\r\n     American Social Science Association\" of statistics concerning the\r\n     illiteracy of women in the United States. The subject has\r\n     received very general discussion, and these are the conclusions\r\n     reached:\r\n\r\n          1. That there is a large excess of female illiteracy. 2.\r\n          That from 1850 to 1860 there was an increase of illiterate\r\n          women to the extent of 53 per cent. in New Hampshire, 27 in\r\n          Vermont, 24 in Massachusetts, 33 in Rhode Island, 16 in\r\n          Connecticut, 37 in the District of Columbia, 33 in\r\n          Wisconsin and 32 in Minnesota. 3. That this state of things\r\n          is alarming, and ought to be remedied.\r\n\r\n     When the London _Saturday Review_ raised the cry of alcoholic\r\n     drunkenness among women, the conservative journals all over the\r\n     world swelled the sound and confirmed the charges. Now that that\r\n     story has run itself to death, a new assault is projected, and a\r\n     general clamor concerning their illiteracy follows. If the\r\n     charges are true, there is nothing very astonishing about them.\r\n     The education of women has been considered a matter of secondary\r\n     importance until very recently, and with our foreign population\r\n     the education of girls has been almost wholly neglected. When the\r\n     customs and usages of the world have made ignorance largely\r\n     compulsory in women, it is somewhat inconsistent in men to go\r\n     into spasms about the results.\r\n\r\nJanuary 17, 1874, at the Republican State convention, Mayor Briggs\r\nof Manchester, on taking the chair, made a speech, rehearsing the\r\nhistory of the party and laying out its programme for the future,\r\nclosing as follows:\r\n\r\n     The Republican party has future duties. Its mission cannot end\r\n     and its work should not, so long as any radical reform shall yet\r\n     urge its demands in behalf of humanity. The civil service reform\r\n     is eminent and important. In this regard the movement of the\r\n     present administration is in the right direction, and yet it is\r\n     only a first step of many which must ultimately be taken. To the\r\n     people, not to a part of the people, belongs the sovereignty of\r\n     this nation. Let them keep it. To this end great care should be\r\n     taken to guard against the caucus system. Nothing should be more\r\n     scrupulously avoided in the management of political parties.\r\n     Anti-republican in spirit, it is sometimes exclusive in practice.\r\n     The people have the same right to nominate that they have to\r\n     elect their own officers. Why not? Ultimately, too, they will\r\n     take that right, and for its own sake no party can afford to make\r\n     itself the nursery of caucus power. The political machinery\r\n     should be simplified, that nothing which mere politicians can\r\n     desire shall stand between the people and their government. In a\r\n     genuine republic, every act of the government should be but a\r\n     practical expression of its subjects. All the subjects, too,\r\n     should share equally the power of such expression. There should\r\n     be no exclusion among intelligent, qualified classes. Involved in\r\n     this principle is the idea of woman suffrage, the next great\r\n     moral issue, in my judgment, which this country must meet, and a\r\n     reform which no party can afford to despise. Indubitably right,\r\n     as I believe it to be, I regard its success as inevitable, and\r\n     that whatever party opposes it is as surely destined to defeat,\r\n     as was the party which arrayed itself in opposition to the\r\n     anti-slavery cause.\r\n\r\nThe following letter in the _Woman's Journal_ shows that something\r\nof the spirit of the Connecticut Smith-sisters has been found in\r\nNew Hampshire:\r\n\r\n     I have long felt a deep interest in the subject of woman's\r\n     rights, and some fifteen years ago I resisted taxation two\r\n     successive years. The second year I worked out my highway tax,\r\n     for which crime I brought down upon my guilty head a severe\r\n     persecution from both men and women, from clergymen and lawyers,\r\n     as well as other classes of my fellow townsmen. The\r\n     tax-collectors came into my house and attached furniture and sold\r\n     it at auction in order to collect my tax, one of whom made me all\r\n     the cost the laws would allow. The most incensed town officers\r\n     threatened that if I resisted taxation the next year, they would\r\n     take my house from me and sell it at auction. One of the\r\n     tax-gatherers asked me what I thought I could do alone in\r\n     resisting taxation. He said he did not believe there was another\r\n     woman in the State of New Hampshire who possessed the hardihood\r\n     to take such a stand against the laws. The editor of one of our\r\n     weekly journals, who professed to be an advocate of woman's\r\n     rights, and who was a candidate for representative in the State\r\n     legislature, condemned me through the columns of his paper, in\r\n     order to secure the votes of his fellow townsmen who were opposed\r\n     to woman's rights. He had nothing to fear from me, knowing that I\r\n     was only a disfranchised slave. Such unjust treatment seemed so\r\n     cruel that I sometimes felt I could willingly lay down my life,\r\n     if it would deliver my sex from such degrading oppression. I\r\n     have, every year since, submissively paid my taxes, humbly hoping\r\n     and praying that I may live to see the day that women will not be\r\n     compelled to pay taxes without representation.\r\n\r\n                                                   MARY L. HARRINGTON.\r\n\r\n     _Claremont, N. H., January 17, 1874._\r\n\r\nIn 1870 a law was passed allowing women to be members of school\r\ncommittees; and eight years later a law was enacted permitting\r\nwomen to vote at school meetings. On the evening of August 7, 1878,\r\nthe House Special Committee granted a hearing to the friends[192]\r\nof the School-suffrage bill, which had already passed the Senate by\r\na unanimous vote; and the next day, when the bill came up for final\r\naction in the House, the following debate occurred:\r\n\r\n     Mr. BATCHELDER of Littleton said: This bill is one of the\r\n     greatest importance, and before we vote upon it let us have the\r\n     views of the committee.\r\n\r\n     Mr. GALEN FOSTER of Canterbury called upon Mr. Blodgett to give\r\n     his opinion as to the power of the legislature upon the question.\r\n\r\n     Mr. BLODGETT of Franklin said he had no doubt of the\r\n     constitutionality of the bill. School districts were created by\r\n     statute and not by the constitution; hence the legislature had a\r\n     perfect right to say who should vote in controlling their\r\n     affairs.\r\n\r\n     Mr. FOSTER said: The mothers of our children should have a voice\r\n     in their education. We have allowed women to hold certain offices\r\n     in connection with schools, but we have never given them a voice\r\n     in the control of the money expended upon them. The mothers take\r\n     ten times more interest in the education of the young than the\r\n     fathers do, and should have an equal voice in the affairs of the\r\n     school districts. This is a matter of right and justice.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SINCLAIR of Bethlehem said: There ought not to be any\r\n     objection to this bill. If there is any class that ought to have\r\n     a voice in the education of children, it is the mothers.\r\n     [Applause.] Some of the best school committees in the State are\r\n     women. If they can be elected to that office, is it proper to say\r\n     they shall have no voice in the elections?\r\n\r\n     Mr. WHICHER of Strafford thought they would get a little mixed in\r\n     carrying out the provisions of this bill, in the face of the\r\n     statutes relating to school-district meetings. He would move to\r\n     indefinitely postpone the bill.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MOSHER of Dover said: There ought to be a new motion gotten\r\n     up; to \"indefinitely postpone\" is getting to be stereotyped. This\r\n     bill needs no further championing. Its justice is apparent.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOBBS of Ossippee said: If women are capable of holding\r\n     office they are also capable of saying who shall hold it.\r\n     [Applause.]\r\n\r\n     Mr. PATTEN of Manchester favored the bill and hoped the motion of\r\n     Mr. Whicher would be voted down.\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER [Mr. WOOLSON of Lisbon] said: The bill had passed the\r\n     Senate unanimously, been reported unanimously by the committee,\r\n     and he hoped it would be passed promptly by the House.\r\n     [Applause.]\r\n\r\n     Mr. PATTERSON of Hanover said he would congratulate the gentleman\r\n     from Bethlehem on being orthodox on this question.\r\n\r\n     Mr. SINCLAIR congratulated his friend from Hanover on his display\r\n     of courage in waiting until the ice was broken all round before\r\n     making a forward step.\r\n\r\nMr. Whicher withdrew his motion to postpone and then moved to lay\r\nthe bill upon the table. This being lost, the bill was passed,\r\nAugust 8, 1878. Mrs. White, the president of the State association,\r\nin a letter to a friend, wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n     To our surprise and delight the bill allowing women to vote at\r\n     school-district meetings passed the House yesterday amid much\r\n     cheering and clapping of hands, the ladies in the gallery joining\r\n     in the demonstration. Thus conservative New Hampshire leads New\r\n     England in this branch of reform for women.\r\n\r\nThe governor, B. F. Prescott, signed the bill without delay and\r\nwords of cheer poured into the capital city from all quarters;\r\nespecially were Mr. and Mrs. White congratulated upon this good\r\nresult of their earnest and persistent labors. The following is\r\nfrom the _Woman's Journal_:\r\n\r\n     At the first election at the State capital of New Hampshire under\r\n     the new law allowing women to vote on school questions, the\r\n     result was a wonderfully full vote, not less than 2,160 ballots\r\n     being cast, of which over half were deposited by women. The\r\n     Boston _Investigator_, from which we gather these facts, says:\r\n\r\n          The balloting extended over three meetings and the number of\r\n          women who participated was almost exactly doubled on the\r\n          second and third evenings--150, 299, 662. Another\r\n          interesting feature of this election was the fact that the\r\n          sexes did not rally to the support of opposing tickets, but\r\n          men and women divided their votes very evenly. A ticket\r\n          bearing the names of two men was elected by a narrow\r\n          majority over another which bore the names of a man and\r\n          woman.\r\n\r\n     Of the first evening's election the telegraphic dispatch to the\r\n     _Boston Globe_ was headed, \"Crowds of Women Voting in New\r\n     Hampshire\":\r\n\r\n          CONCORD, N. H., March 22.--The occasion of the annual\r\n          meeting of the Union-school district of this city, which\r\n          comprises all of the city proper, this evening, was one of\r\n          unprecedented interest. For months school matters have been\r\n          sharply agitated and the election has been looked forward to\r\n          as an opportunity by all parties. To the uncommon interest\r\n          centered in the matter the right of women to vote at school\r\n          meetings, delegated by the last session of the legislature,\r\n          greatly added. The new condition of affairs had been fully\r\n          canvassed and the women had determined on making the best of\r\n          their first opportunity and winning a decisive victory if\r\n          possible. The night of the meeting proved inauspicious, but\r\n          notwithstanding the severe storm of snow and sleet that was\r\n          falling the newly constituted citizens were out in force. At\r\n          the hour of opening the meeting the City Hall was packed to\r\n          suffocation, 500 of the audience, at least, being ladies.\r\n          The first business was the choice of a moderator, and in\r\n          this the ladies may claim a victory, as the candidate a\r\n          majority of them supported was elected in the person of\r\n          ex-mayor John Kimball. After this came the reading of the\r\n          report of the board of education, which was strenuously\r\n          objected to by the male supporters of the ladies. In this\r\n          they were beaten by a large majority. The reading completed,\r\n          the meeting commenced to ballot for three members of the\r\n          board. The scene then became one beyond the power of the\r\n          reportorial pen to describe. It was an old-fashioned New\r\n          Hampshire town-meeting, with the concomitant boisterousness\r\n          and profanity subdued by the presence of the ladies. A line\r\n          was formed to the polls and a struggling mass of humanity in\r\n          which male and female citizens were incongruously and\r\n          indecorously mixed, surged towards the ballot-box. The\r\n          crowding, squeezing and pushing were severe enough for the\r\n          taste of the masculine voter, and were harsh enough to make\r\n          it extremely unpleasant for the dear creatures who were\r\n          undergoing so much to cast their maiden vote. To add to the\r\n          delay the Hon. Nathaniel White had planted his somewhat\r\n          corpulent form directly in front of the ballot-box and\r\n          stayed the surging tide to shake hands with every woman that\r\n          voted. Having voted, the men were only too glad to leave the\r\n          crowded hall and let the anxious crowd rush in. The vote was\r\n          at last all in, and the work of counting completed shortly\r\n          before 11 o'clock. It was found that there were some ten\r\n          different tickets in the field, and forty-two candidates\r\n          voted for; but from this mass of votes there was no choice,\r\n          though the regular candidates, the outgoing members of the\r\n          board, who would have been elected had it not been for the\r\n          new element in the election, were ahead, having a plurality.\r\n          The meeting was then adjourned till next Saturday evening,\r\n          when the scenes of to-night will be intensified by a larger\r\n          attendance and still greater interest. The meeting to-night\r\n          obtains importance in New Hampshire, as this is the center\r\n          of female suffrage sentiment in this State, and the women\r\n          are determined to win here if possible.\r\n\r\nIn the opening convention of November 5, 1879, Mrs. White, the\r\npresident, made the following address:\r\n\r\n     _Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends of the N. H. Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association_: We hold the seventh meeting of this association\r\n     under circumstances that mark an epoch in the progress of equal\r\n     rights, irrespective of sex, in this State. After more than a\r\n     decade of agitation, and petitioning of our legislature, women\r\n     hold in their hand the ballot on one important matter. Let us\r\n     exchange congratulations on this occasion, that so much has been\r\n     gained toward the final triumph of our cause.\r\n\r\n     You will remember when this association was last in session,\r\n     July, 1878, that the bill giving the women of New Hampshire the\r\n     right to vote on the public-school questions, was pending in our\r\n     legislature. At our first hearing before that body, we hardly\r\n     dared anticipate the passage of the bill during that session. But\r\n     agitation, vigilance and perseverance ever bring their sure\r\n     reward in the end, therefore we continued to press our claim, and\r\n     soon learned to our great satisfaction that our allies in behalf\r\n     of this bill, were the very _cream_ of our legislature. We at\r\n     once took courage, and as day after day we went up to the\r\n     state-house, with friends who plead for it before the committee,\r\n     who kindly gave us several hearings; we saw the gradual growth of\r\n     interest in behalf of this bill soon ripen into a final decision\r\n     causing it to pass; thereby enacting a law, to which our worthy\r\n     governor, B. F. Prescott, immediately gave his willing signature,\r\n     securing to the women of this State the high privilege many of\r\n     them gladly exercised last spring. Many feared this law would be\r\n     repealed; but to show with what favor it has been received, we\r\n     have only to refer to the legislature of the present year, which\r\n     passed an additional law, giving to women not only the right to\r\n     vote for and serve on school boards, but also the power to serve\r\n     as moderator or clerk in school meetings, for which the former\r\n     law did not provide. This, it would seem must remove all fears of\r\n     a repeal.\r\n\r\n     Petitions asking municipal suffrage for women, were sent to our\r\n     last legislature, and a bill to that effect, introduced in the\r\n     House, was referred to a special committee, who reported in its\r\n     favor: and after more or less discussion, although the bill did\r\n     not pass, about one hundred members voted for it, and their names\r\n     are registered, and with the committee, will be kindly remembered\r\n     by those women whose cause they did not desert. From past\r\n     experience we see the importance of continued labor and proper\r\n     measures for the accomplishment of our work. The present degree\r\n     of progress indicates the fact that we are not to obtain the full\r\n     recognition of our rights at one bound, but that they are coming\r\n     step by step. To note the growth of our principles in the various\r\n     reform movements, let us look at the temperance organizations\r\n     throughout the length and breadth of this country; we find nearly\r\n     all of them now discussing the ballot for women. Why, no sooner\r\n     had Massachusetts, following the example of New Hampshire,\r\n     obtained the school ballot for women, than the Woman's Christian\r\n     Temperance Unions all over the State were a unit for the\r\n     temperance ballot, and the past year have had their agents\r\n     canvassing the State in the interest of school suffrage and \"home\r\n     protection.\"\r\n\r\n     All who read the reports last winter of Frances E. Willard's\r\n     labors in Illinois in behalf of her Home Protection bill (for it\r\n     originated with her), of the list of petitioners of both sexes\r\n     she secured and took to Springfield, of the delegation of women\r\n     who accompanied her there to advocate her bill, must acknowledge\r\n     the educating force of all such untiring devotion for the right\r\n     to vote. Although she was not victorious, she was successful\r\n     beyond all expectation, for it is said, \"Success is not always a\r\n     victory, nor is victory always a success in the end.\" Let me say\r\n     here, Miss Willard believes in the entire enfranchisement of her\r\n     sex, but in her earnest and faithful labors makes a specialty of\r\n     the temperance ballot.\r\n\r\n     At the annual meeting of the New Hampshire Woman's Christian\r\n     Temperance Union, held here one year ago, a resolution was\r\n     offered by a most worthy lady, indorsing suffrage for women on\r\n     all temperance questions. It was at once vigorously opposed by\r\n     some, while others, although believing in it, feared it would\r\n     divide their ranks if it passed, and felt too timid to give it\r\n     their support. The lady offering it, seeing it would be defeated,\r\n     withdrew it, at the same time giving notice that she should\r\n     present the same, or one similar, to that body every year as long\r\n     as she lived, or until it passed. Last month the same\r\n     organization held its annual meeting in Portsmouth, and that\r\n     lady, as good as her word, was there with her resolution on\r\n     temperance suffrage, and it passed unanimously, about 100\r\n     delegates being present and voting, many of whom acknowledged the\r\n     timidity they felt last year, but now earnestly gave it their\r\n     support. Such experiences give us some idea of the different\r\n     instrumentalities by which our cause is forced upon conservative\r\n     minds for consideration, ending in honest conviction.\r\n\r\n     In closing, I know you will all unite with me in tributes to Mr.\r\n     Garrison. Now that he has gone to join that innumerable host of\r\n     philanthropists in the higher life, let us rejoice that he was\r\n     one of the leaders of that reform which brings us here to-day.\r\n     And now, friends, in view of the present status of our cause,\r\n     have we not much to encourage us in our work? May we go forward\r\n     in that spirit of good-will that shall bring us a speedy victory.\r\n\r\nResolutions of respect to the memory of Mrs. Abby P. Ela, William\r\nLloyd Garrison and Angelina Grimke Weld were adopted by a rising\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nIn the _National Citizen_ of December 14, 1879, we find the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     Marilla M. Ricker of New Hampshire had an executive hearing\r\n     before the governor and council of that State, November 18, in\r\n     regard to the management of the State prison. Mrs. Ricker, who in\r\n     winter practices law in Washington, and is known as \"the\r\n     prisoner's friend,\" referred to the cruel treatment of convicts\r\n     in various States, notably in New Hampshire, where prisoners are\r\n     not permitted to read the magazines or the weekly newspapers\r\n     which contain no record of crime, nor to receive words from their\r\n     friends, as in other States they are allowed at stated times to\r\n     do. When Mrs. Ricker desired to see a certain prisoner and let\r\n     him know he had friends who were yet mindful of his comfort, the\r\n     warden replied that he did not wish that man \"to think he had a\r\n     friend in the world.\" Mrs. Ricker warmly protested against such\r\n     brutality. The attorney-general agreed with Mrs. Ricker,\r\n     remarking that the line between crimes punished and those not\r\n     punished, and the lines between those in prison and those\r\n     outside who ought to be there, were so dim and shadowy that great\r\n     care should be exercised in order to secure just and humane\r\n     treatment for prisoners. Mrs. Ricker's remarks were earnest and\r\n     dignified, and were listened to with the closest attention by the\r\n     governor and his official advisers. At the close of the hearing\r\n     the governor referred the subject to the special prison committee\r\n     of the council, directing its members to procure all possible\r\n     information as to the management of penitentiaries in other\r\n     States, and report at the next meeting. Through Mrs. Ricker's\r\n     influence the last legislature passed an act providing that any\r\n     convict may send sealed letters to the governor or council\r\n     without their being read by the warden.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 a judicial decision in New Hampshire recognized the advance\r\nlegislation of that State in regard to the position of married\r\nwomen. This decision shows that they are no longer under the shadow\r\nof the old common law, but now hold equal dignity and power as\r\nindividuals and joint heads in family life. The \"divinely ordained\r\nhead,\" with absolute control in the home, to rule according to his\r\nwill and pleasure, is at last ruled out of the courts altogether,\r\nas the following case illustrates:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Harris and her husband sued Mrs. Webster and her husband for\r\n     slanders uttered by Mrs. Webster against Mrs. Harris. The suit\r\n     was brought on the old theory that the legal personality of the\r\n     wife is merged in that of her husband; that she is under his\r\n     control, his chattel, his ox, and therefore he is responsible for\r\n     her trespasses as for those of his other domestic cattle. The\r\n     Court held that the wife is no longer an \"ox\" or \"chattel,\" but a\r\n     person responsible for her acts, and that her innocent husband\r\n     could not be held responsible for her wrong. In rendering the\r\n     decision in this case, Judge Foster further said: \"It is no\r\n     longer possible to say that in New Hampshire a married woman is a\r\n     household slave or a chattel, or that in New Hampshire the\r\n     conjugal unity is represented solely by the husband. By custom\r\n     and by statute the wife is now joint master of the household, and\r\n     not a slave or a servant. The rule now is that her legal\r\n     existence is not suspended. So practically has the ancient unity\r\n     become dissevered and dissolved that the wife may not only have\r\n     her separate property, contracts, debts, wages, and causes of\r\n     separate action growing out of a violation of her personal\r\n     rights, but she may enter into legal contract with her husband\r\n     and enforce it by suit against him.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer of the following letter is a successful farmer,\r\nremarkable for her executive ability in all the practical affairs\r\nof life, as well as for her broad philanthropy. One year she sent,\r\nas a contribution to our Washington convention, a tub of butter\r\nholding about sixty pounds, which was sold on the platform and the\r\nproceeds put into the treasury of the National Association:\r\n\r\n     _Dear Friends assembled in the Washington Convention:_\r\n\r\n     Last week our new town-house was dedicated. The women accompanied\r\n     their husbands. One man spoke in favor of woman suffrage--said it\r\n     was \"surely coming.\" In this town, at the Corners, for several\r\n     years they tried to get a graded school, but the men voted it\r\n     down. After the women had the school-suffrage, one lady, who had\r\n     a large family and did not wish to send her children away from\r\n     home, rallied all the women of the Corners, carried the vote, and\r\n     they now have a good graded school. Our village is moving down,\r\n     that the boys and girls may have the benefit of the good school\r\n     there. I think the women who have been indifferent and not\r\n     availed themselves of their small voting privilege, by which we\r\n     might have established the same class of school in our village,\r\n     will now regret their negligence, at least every time they have\r\n     to send three miles for a doctor. Thus, stupid people, blind to\r\n     their own interest, punish themselves. I regret not being able to\r\n     send a fuller report of the good that woman's use of the ballot,\r\n     in a limited form, has done for us in this State. The voting in\r\n     the town-hall is the \"infant school\" for women in the use of the\r\n     ballot. Thanking the ladies all for meeting at the capital of the\r\n     nation, and regretting not to be counted among the number, I am,\r\n\r\n                         Yours sincerely,           MARY A. P. FILLEY.\r\n\r\n     _North Haverill, January 5, 1884._\r\n\r\nIn closing this chapter some mention should be made of the\r\ninvaluable services of Senator Blair,[193] who, in his place, has\r\nalways nobly defended the rights of women. He was a member of the\r\nfirst special committee ever appointed to look after the interests\r\nof women in the United States Senate. The leaders of the movement\r\nin that State claim that they helped to place Senator Blair in his\r\npresent position by defeating his predecessor, Mr. Wadleigh, who\r\nwas hostile to the enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\n               UNITED STATES SENATE, WASHINGTON, D. C., March 5, 1884.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MISS ANTHONY: I had the honor duly to receive your\r\n     invitation to address the National Association during its\r\n     sessions in this city, for which I heartily thank you; but the\r\n     pressure of duties in the Senate, service upon committees being\r\n     just now specially exacting, makes it impossible for me to\r\n     accept.\r\n\r\n     I trust that I need not assure you of my full belief that woman\r\n     has the right and ought to have the privilege to vote. Whenever a\r\n     fundamental right exists both public and individual welfare are\r\n     promoted by its exercise and injured by its suppression. The\r\n     exercise of rights is only another name for the discharge of\r\n     duties, and the denial of the suffrage to an adult human being,\r\n     not deprived of it for mental or penal disability, is an\r\n     intolerable wrong. Such denial is not only a deprivation of right\r\n     to the individual, but it is an injury to the State, which is\r\n     only well governed when controlled by the conflicting opinions,\r\n     sentiments and interests of the whole, harmonized in the\r\n     ballot-box, and, by its fiat, elevated to the functions of law.\r\n     But you have no occasion for expression of theoretical views from\r\n     me.\r\n\r\n     If I may be pardoned a suggestion, it would be the specification\r\n     to the public mind of the practical uses and benefits which would\r\n     result from the exercise of the suffrage by women. Men are not\r\n     conscious that women lack the practical protection of the laws or\r\n     the comforts and conveniences of material and social relations\r\n     more than themselves. The possession of the ballot as a practical\r\n     means of securing happiness does not appear to the masses to be\r\n     necessary to women in our country. Men say: \"We do the best we\r\n     can for our wives and children and relatives. They are as well\r\n     off as we.\" In a certain sense this appears to be true. The other\r\n     and higher truth is that woman suffrage is necessary in order\r\n     that society may advance. The natural conservatism of an existing\r\n     order of things will not give way to a new factor in the control\r\n     of affairs, until it has been shown in what way enlightened\r\n     selfishness may hope for good to society if the change be made.\r\n     Here it seems to me that the convention may now strike a blow\r\n     more powerful than for many years. Society has not so labored\r\n     with the great problems which concern its own salvation for\r\n     generations.\r\n\r\n     What would woman do with the ballot if she had it? What for\r\n     education? What for sobriety? What for social purity? What for\r\n     equalizing the conditions and the rewards of labor--the labor of\r\n     her own sex first--and towards a just division of production\r\n     among all members of the community? What for the removal, or for\r\n     the amelioration when removal is impossible, of hunger, cold,\r\n     disease and degradation, from the daily lives of human beings?\r\n     What could and what _would_ woman do with the ballot which is not\r\n     now as well done by man alone, to improve the conditions which\r\n     envelope individual existence as with bands of iron? What good\r\n     things--state them _seriatim_, as the lawyers say--could woman do\r\n     in New Hampshire and in New York city, and ultimately among the\r\n     savage tribes of the earth, which she cannot do as well without\r\n     as with the suffrage? Would woman by her suffrage even _help_ to\r\n     remove illiteracy from Louisiana, intemperance from New England,\r\n     and stop society from committing murder by the tenement-house\r\n     abuses of New York? Let the convention specify what practical\r\n     good woman will try to achieve with her God-given rights,\r\n     provided that men will permit her to enjoy them. Show us wherein\r\n     you will do _us_ good if we will rob you no longer. It might\r\n     influence us greatly. Why should we do right for nothing? In\r\n     fact, unless you show that the exercise of your alleged right\r\n     will be useful, can you logically conclude that you have any? We\r\n     must have proof that the experiment will not fail before we will\r\n     even try it. You must connect the ballot with progress and reform\r\n     and convince men that they, as well as women, will be better off\r\n     for its possession by the whole of the adult community rather\r\n     than only by a part. Theories may be true, but they are seldom\r\n     reduced to practice by society unless it can be clearly seen that\r\n     their adoption will heal some hurt or introduce some broad and\r\n     general good.\r\n\r\n     The increasing discussion of industrial, educational, sanitary,\r\n     and social questions generally, indicates the domain of argument\r\n     and effort where victories for the advocates of enlarged suffrage\r\n     are most likely, and I think are sure to be won. Woman should\r\n     study specially what is called, for the want of a better term,\r\n     the labor problem--a problem which includes in its scope almost\r\n     everything important to everybody. I know this is an unnecessary\r\n     suggestion, for it is just what you are doing. I only write it\r\n     because repetition of the important is better than to recite\r\n     platitudes or even to quote the declaration. I believe in your\r\n     success because I believe in justice and in the advancement of\r\n     mankind.\r\n\r\n          Very respectfully, your obedient servant,    HENRY W. BLAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[188] _Concord_, Nathaniel P. White, Mrs. Sarah Pillsbury, Rev. J.\r\nF. Lovering, P. B. Cogswell, Mrs. Eliza Morrill, Mrs. Louisa W.\r\nWood, Col. James E.

B. Blackwell on the _Vermont Watchman_--Mary A.\r\n     Livermore in the _Woman's Journal_--Sarah A. Gibbs' Reply to Rev.\r\n     Mr. Holmes--School Suffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the miseries growing out of the civil war were in a measure\r\nmitigated, there was a general awakening in the New England States\r\non the question of suffrage for women, and in 1868 one after\r\nanother organized for action. What Nathaniel P. Rogers was to New\r\nHampshire in the anti-slavery struggle that was Clarina Howard\r\nNichols[194] to Vermont in early calling attention to the unjust\r\nlaws for woman. From 1843 to 1853 she edited the _Windham County\r\nDemocrat_, in which she wrote a series of editorials on the\r\nproperty rights of women, and from year to year made her appeals in\r\nperson to successive legislatures. Her patient labors for many\r\nyears prepared the way for the organized action of 1868. The women\r\nof that State can never too highly appreciate all that it cost that\r\nnoble woman to stand alone, as she did, through such bitter\r\npersecutions, vindicating for them the great principles of\r\nrepublican government.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after a quarter of a century, instead of that one solitary\r\nvoice in the district school-house and the State capitol, are heard\r\nin all Vermont's towns and cities, echoing through her valleys and\r\nmountains, the clarion voices of a whole band of distinguished men\r\nand women from all the Eastern States. The revival of the woman\r\nquestion in Vermont began with propositions to amend the\r\nconstitution. We are indebted to a series of letters, written by a\r\ncitizen of Burlington, signed \"St. Andrew,\" for many of the\r\ninteresting incidents and substantial facts as to the initiative\r\nsteps taken in this campaign. He said:\r\n\r\n     The only way of amending the constitution is for the people\r\n     (meaning the male voters) to elect, every seventh year, a board\r\n     called the Council of Censors, consisting of thirteen persons.\r\n     This council can, within a certain time, propose amendments to\r\n     the constitution, and call a convention of one delegate from each\r\n     town, elected by the freemen, to adopt or reject the articles of\r\n     amendment proposed by the council. The Council of Censors,\r\n     elected in March, 1869, proposed six amendments: (1) In relation\r\n     to the creation of corporations; (2) in relation to biennial\r\n     sessions and elections; (3) in relation to filling vacancies in\r\n     the office of senators and town representatives; (4) in relation\r\n     to the appointment, terms, etc., of judges of the Supreme Court;\r\n     (5) providing that women shall be entitled to vote, and with no\r\n     other restrictions than the law shall impose on men; (6) in\r\n     relation to the manner of amending the constitution.\r\n\r\n     The election of delegates occurs on Tuesday, May 10, and the\r\n     convention meets on the first Wednesday in June. There is no\r\n     general excitement in the State in relation to any of the\r\n     proposed changes; and now, upon the eve of the election, it is\r\n     impossible for the most sagacious political observer to predict\r\n     the fate of any of the amendments. The fifth is the only one in\r\n     support of which public meetings have been held, and those took\r\n     place the early part of the spring at the larger places in the\r\n     State. The friends have never expected to obtain a majority, nor\r\n     even a considerable vote in the convention, and the meetings that\r\n     have been held were not expected to settle the question, but to\r\n     awaken the public mind upon the subject. These meetings have been\r\n     a decided success, attended by hundreds of intelligent citizens,\r\n     many of whom for the first time listened to an address upon the\r\n     subject. It is true that ladies were advised to remain away, but\r\n     such advice generally resulted in a larger attendance; and to-day\r\n     the measure has a firmer support than ever before, and its\r\n     advocates are more confident of final success. We may not have\r\n     more than \"_ten righteous_\" men elected to the convention, but\r\n     that number was enough to save the cities of the _plain_, and we\r\n     have full faith that as small a number can save the cities of the\r\n     _mountains_.\r\n\r\n     The press of the State is divided on the subject. We have two\r\n     dailies--one, the _Rutland Herald_, the oldest paper in the\r\n     State, in favor of the movement, and the _Free Press_ of\r\n     Burlington, opposed to it. After the coming convention, no change\r\n     can be made in our constitution for seven years, at least, and if\r\n     the sixth amendment be adopted, not for ten years. But, in the\r\n     meantime, the question will assume more importance by a constant\r\n     agitation as to the equality of the sexes, the admission of women\r\n     to the State University, the professions, and other rights to\r\n     which men are entitled. Vermont can never emulate in wealth and\r\n     population the manufacturing States of the seaboard, or the\r\n     prairie States of the West; but she can win a nobler preeminence\r\n     in the quality of her institutions. She may be the first State,\r\n     as Wyoming already is the first territory, to give political\r\n     equality to woman, and to show the world the model of a true\r\n     republic.\r\n\r\n                                                           ST. ANDREW.\r\n\r\n     _Burlington, Vt., May 1, 1870._\r\n\r\nMr. Reed of Washington county submitted the report in favor of the\r\nwoman suffrage amendment, from which we give the following:\r\n\r\n     One-half of the people of our State are denied the right of\r\n     suffrage. Yet woman has all the qualifications--the capacity, the\r\n     desire for the public welfare, that man has. She is among the\r\n     governed. She pays taxes. Even-handed justice, a fair application\r\n     of the principles of the Declaration of Independence and of our\r\n     State constitution, give woman the ballot. There is no reason why\r\n     woman should not be allowed to do what she is so eminently fit to\r\n     do. We know no good reason why the most ignorant man should vote\r\n     and the intelligent woman be refused. Our present political\r\n     institutions were formed and shaped when men had their chief\r\n     interests and pursuits out of doors, and women remained the\r\n     humble slaves at home. The social change has been immense. Now\r\n     woman sits by the side of man, is his companion and associate in\r\n     his amusements, and in his labors, save the one of governing the\r\n     country. And it is time that she should be in this.\r\n\r\n     The position of woman in regard to the common schools of the\r\n     State is the most unjust. She must always be the chief instructor\r\n     of the young in point of time and influence. She is their best\r\n     teacher at home and in the school. And her share in this\r\n     ever-expanding work is becoming vaster every day. Woman as\r\n     mother, sister, teacher, has an intelligence, a comprehension of\r\n     the educational needs of our youth, and an interest in their\r\n     development, far in advance of the other sex. She can organize,\r\n     control and teach the most difficult school in the State; yet she\r\n     has no vote in the selection of teachers, the building,\r\n     arrangements and equipments of school-houses, nor in the method\r\n     and extent of instruction. She can pay her share of the expenses\r\n     of schools, but can have no legal voice in their management. She\r\n     can teach, but she can have no vote in determining what shall be\r\n     taught. She is the very corner-stone of institutions which she\r\n     has no power in shaping. Let us have her open, avowed and public\r\n     cooeperation--always safer than indirect influence.\r\n\r\nThe submission of an amendment to the constitution necessarily\r\naroused a general agitation on the proposed changes. The fifth\r\namendment decided on by the board of censors seemed to create a\r\nmore general interest than either of the others, and accordingly a\r\nmeeting was called for its full consideration, that efficient steps\r\nmight be taken for a thorough canvass of the State, preparatory to\r\nthe May election, and issued the following call:\r\n\r\n     The friends of woman suffrage in Vermont are requested to meet in\r\n     mass convention at Montpelier on Wednesday, February 2, at 10\r\n     o'clock, for the purpose of considering and advancing the best\r\n     interests of the cause in this State, in view of the\r\n     constitutional amendment proposed by the council of censors. The\r\n     convention will be addressed by several ladies and prominent\r\n     gentlemen of this State, and by William Lloyd Garrison, Julia\r\n     Ward Howe and Rev. Ada C. Bowles of Massachusetts; Lucy Stone and\r\n     Henry B. Blackwell of New Jersey, and Mary A. Livermore of\r\n     Illinois. A public meeting will also be held the evening before\r\n     the convention, which will be addressed by some of the eminent\r\n     speakers above named. The Hutchinson family will be present and\r\n     sing their woman suffrage songs. The Vermont Central, Passumpsic,\r\n     Rutland and Burlington and Bennington and Rutland lines of\r\n     railroad will extend the courtesy of free return checks, provided\r\n     they shall be applied for by twenty-five or more persons paying\r\n     full fare one way over an average distance of each of their\r\n     respective roads, which will be determined by the secretary.\r\n\r\n               C. W. WILLARD,             JAMES HUTCHINSON, JR.,\r\n               GEORGE H. BIGELOW,         CHARLES REED,\r\n               NEWMAN WEEKS,              JONATHAN ROSS,\r\n                               JAMES S. PECK.\r\n                _Ex. Com. Vermont Woman Suffrage Association_.[195]\r\n\r\n     _Montpelier_, January 10, 1870.\r\n\r\nIt is a noticeable fact that the movement for the enfranchisement\r\nof woman in Vermont was inaugurated wholly by men. Not a woman was\r\non its official board, nor was there one to speak in the State. Men\r\ncalled the first woman's rights convention, and chose Hon. Charles\r\nReed of Montpelier as its presiding officer, as well as president\r\nof the State association.\r\n\r\nHowever, these gentlemen invited ladies from other States, and a\r\nseries of meetings[196] was inaugurated through the chief towns and\r\ncities of Vermont. The speakers[197] were heartily welcomed at some\r\npoints and rudely received at others. The usual \"free-love\" cry was\r\nstarted by some of the opposition papers--a cry that like \"infidel\"\r\nin the anti-slavery days, oft' times frightened even the faithful\r\nfrom their propriety. Henry B. Blackwell came to the rescue, and\r\nably answered the _Vermont Watchman_:\r\n\r\n     The _Vermont Watchman_ evades the discussion of the question\r\n     whether women shall be entitled to vote, by raising false issues.\r\n     The editor asserts that \"many of the advocates of suffrage have\r\n     thrown scorn upon marriage and upon the Divine Word.\" That\r\n     assertion we denounced as an unfounded and wicked calumny. We\r\n     also objected to it as an evasion of the main question. Thereupon\r\n     the _Watchman_, instead of correcting its mistake and discussing\r\n     the question of suffrage, repeats the charge, and seeks to\r\n     sustain it by garbled quotations and groundless assertions, which\r\n     we stigmatized accordingly. The _Watchman_ now calls upon us to\r\n     retract the stigma. We prefer to prove that our censure is\r\n     deserved, and proceed to do so.\r\n\r\n     The first quotation of the _Watchman_ is from an editorial in the\r\n     _Woman's Journal_, entitled \"Political Organization.\" The object\r\n     of which was to show the propriety of doing what the _Watchman_\r\n     refuses to do--viz.: of discussing woman suffrage upon its own\r\n     merits. It showed the unfairness of complicating the question\r\n     with other topics upon which friends of woman suffrage honestly\r\n     differ. It regretted that \"many well-meaning people insist on\r\n     dragging in their peculiar views on theology, temperance,\r\n     marriage, race, dress, finance, labor, capital--it matters not\r\n     what.\" It condemned \"a confusion of ideas which have no logical\r\n     connection,\" and protested \"against loading the good ship, Woman\r\n     Suffrage, with a cargo of irrelevant opinions.\" The _Watchman_\r\n     cites this article as an admission that some of the friends of\r\n     suffrage advocate free-love. Not at all. The editor of the\r\n     _Watchman_ is himself one of the well-meaning people alluded to.\r\n     He insists on dragging in irrelevant theological and social\r\n     questions. He refuses to confine himself to the issue of\r\n     suffrage. The _Watchman_ quotes a single sentence of the\r\n     following statement:\r\n\r\n          The advocates of woman's equality differ utterly upon every\r\n          other topic. Some are abolitionists, others hostile to the\r\n          equality of races. Some are evangelical Christians; others\r\n          Catholics, Unitarians, Spiritualists, or Quakers. Some hold\r\n          the most rigid theories with regard to marriage and divorce;\r\n          others are latitudinarian on these questions. In short,\r\n          people of the most opposite views agree in desiring to\r\n          establish woman suffrage, while they anticipate very\r\n          different results from the reform, when effected.\r\n\r\n     The above is cited as evidence against us. How so? A man may hold\r\n     \"latitudinarian theories in regard to marriage and divorce\"\r\n     without \"throwing scorn upon the marriage relation,\" or having\r\n     the slightest sympathy with free-love. For instance: The present\r\n     law of Vermont is latitudinarian is these very particulars. It\r\n     grants divorce for many other causes than adultery. Measured by\r\n     the more conservative standard of Henry Ward Beecher and Mary A.\r\n     Livermore, it allows divorce upon insufficient grounds. This law\r\n     represents the public sentiment of a majority of the people of\r\n     Vermont. Will the _Watchman_ assert that the people of Vermont\r\n     \"throw scorn on the marriage relation\"? Or that he is in \"low\r\n     company\" because he is surrounded by the citizens of a State who\r\n     entertain views upon the marriage relation less rigid than his\r\n     own? Our indignant protest against the injustice of the common\r\n     law, which subjects the person, property, earnings and children\r\n     of married women to the irresponsible control of their husbands,\r\n     is not a protest against marriage. It is a vindication of\r\n     marriage, against the barbarism of the law which degrades a\r\n     noble and life-long partnership of equals into a mercenary and\r\n     servile relation between superior and dependant.\r\n\r\n     The _Watchman_ assails prominent supporters of woman suffrage,\r\n     and misquotes and misrepresents them. Because Theodore Tilton is\r\n     unwilling \"that men or women shall be compelled to live together\r\n     as husband and wife against the inward protest of their own\r\n     souls,\" therefore he is charged with advocating free-love. Is it\r\n     possible that the editor regards such a relation of protest and\r\n     disgust as consistent with the unity of Christian marriage? Is it\r\n     right that a pure and noble man, the tender husband of a happy\r\n     wife, the loving father of affectionate children, should be thus\r\n     causelessly traduced for showing that the essential fact of\r\n     marriage is in that unity of soul which is recognized and\r\n     affirmed by the outward form? When the _Watchman_ undertakes to\r\n     brand men and women of irreproachable character for an\r\n     intellectual difference, he is engaged in a very unworthy\r\n     business. When he charges immorality upon the _New York\r\n     Independent_ and infidelity upon John Stuart Mill, he forgets\r\n     that his readers have minds of their own.\r\n\r\n     But, suppose it were true that newspapers and individuals who\r\n     believe in woman suffrage held objectionable views on other\r\n     subjects, what has this to do with the merit of the proposed\r\n     reform? There are impure and intemperate men in the Republican\r\n     party. Is the Republican party therefore \"low company\"? There are\r\n     brutal and ignorant and disloyal men in the Democratic party.\r\n     Does this prove that Dr. Lord and every other Democrat in the\r\n     State of Vermont is brutal and ignorant and disloyal? The Supreme\r\n     Court of the United States has just decided that a divorce\r\n     obtained under the laws of Indiana is legal and binding in every\r\n     other State. In thus affirming Mrs. McFarland's right to marry\r\n     Mr. Richardson, has the Supreme Court of the United States\r\n     sanctioned free-love? Will the _Watchman_ call Chief-Justice\r\n     Chase and the Supreme Court free-lovers? We have very little hope\r\n     that the _Watchman_ will treat this question with fairness or\r\n     candor. Our cause is too strong. The argument from reason, from\r\n     revelation, from nature, from history, is on our side. The\r\n     _Watchman_ is fighting against the Declaration of Independence,\r\n     the bill of rights of the State of Vermont, and the principles of\r\n     representative government. No wonder that it raises false issues.\r\n     No wonder that it evades the question.\r\n\r\n                                                  H. B. B.\r\n\r\nThe following editorial in the _Woman's Journal_, from the pen of\r\nMary A. Livermore, does not give a very rose-colored view of the\r\nreception of the Massachusetts missionaries on their first advent\r\ninto Vermont:\r\n\r\n     The Vermont constitutional convention has rejected a proposition\r\n     to give the ballot to woman, by a vote of 231 to 1. It flouted\r\n     all discussion of the question, and voted it down with the utmost\r\n     alacrity. No one cognizant of the bigotry, narrowness and general\r\n     ignorance that prevail there will be surprised at this result. It\r\n     is not a progressive State, but the contrary. Great stress has\r\n     been laid on the fact that \"Vermont never owned a slave\"--and\r\n     from this it has been argued that the Green Mountain State is\r\n     and has been especially liberty-loving. But during the two brief\r\n     visits we made last winter, we were told again and again, by\r\n     Vermont men, that the only reason for the non-introduction of\r\n     slavery was the impracticability of that form of labor among the\r\n     Green Mountains--that slavery could never have been made\r\n     profitable there, and that this, and not principle and heroic\r\n     love of freedom, prevented Vermont from ever being a slave State.\r\n     Nowhere, not even in the roughest and remotest West, have we met\r\n     with such vulgar rudeness, ill-manners and heroic lying as we\r\n     encountered in Vermont. The lecturers who were invited into the\r\n     State by the Vermont Woman Suffrage Association, composed wholly\r\n     of men, were in many instances left unsupported by them, allowed\r\n     to meet the frequently rough audiences as best they could, to pay\r\n     their own bills, and to manage the campaign as they might. At the\r\n     very first intimation of opposition on the part of the\r\n     _Montpelier Argus_, the _Watchman_ and the _Burlington Free\r\n     Press_--an unworthy trio of papers that appear to control the\r\n     majority--many members of the State association showed the \"white\r\n     feather,\" and either apologetically backed out of the canvass, or\r\n     ignominiously kept silent in the background. There was,\r\n     therefore, nothing like a thorough discussion of the question, no\r\n     fair meeting of truth and error, not even an attempt to canvass\r\n     the State. For, not ambitious to waste their efforts on such\r\n     flinty soil, the men and women who were invited to labor there\r\n     shook off the dust (snow) of Vermont from their feet, and turned\r\n     to more hopeful fields of labor.\r\n\r\n     Let it not be supposed, however, that this vote of the delegates\r\n     of the constitutional convention is any indication of the\r\n     sentiment of the women on this question. The fact that 231 women\r\n     of lawful age, residents of Brattleborough, and 96 of Newfane,\r\n     sent a petition for woman suffrage, with their reasons for asking\r\n     it, to Charles K. Field, delegate from that town to the\r\n     constitutional convention; that petitions from other hundreds of\r\n     women have been forwarded to congress, praying for a sixteenth\r\n     amendment; that, by letters and personal statements, we know the\r\n     most intelligent and thoughtful women everywhere rebel against\r\n     the State laws whose heathenism, despotism and absurdity were so\r\n     well shown by Mrs. Nichols in 1845--all these facts are proofs\r\n     that the sentiment of Vermont women is not represented by the\r\n     constitutional convention now in session at Montpelier.--[M. A.\r\n     L.\r\n\r\nAugust 12, 1871, our Burlington correspondent says:\r\n\r\n     While conventions, picnics and bazar meetings, in the cause of\r\n     woman suffrage, have been held in our sister States, an event has\r\n     very quietly occurred with us which we deem an important step in\r\n     the right direction, viz.: the admission of women to the\r\n     University. By an almost unanimous vote of the corporation, a few\r\n     conservatives opposing it, the matter was referred to the\r\n     faculty, who are understood to be heartily in favor of the \"new\r\n     departure.\" The college that has thus thrown its doors wide open\r\n     to all, is the University of Vermont and State Agricultural\r\n     College, founded by the munificence of General Ira Allen in 1791.\r\n     It commenced operations in 1800; the Federal troops used its\r\n     buildings for barracks in the war of 1812; the buildings (and\r\n     library) were burned in 1824, and reconstructed in the following\r\n     year, when the corner-stone was laid by General Lafayette. It\r\n     sent forth nearly all its sons to the great rebellion. Indeed, at\r\n     one time its condition served to remind one of the lines of\r\n     Holmes--\r\n\r\n          \"Lord, how the _Senior_ knocked about\r\n            That Freshman class of _one_.\"\r\n\r\n     It has graduated such men as the late Senator Collamer, John G.\r\n     Smith, president of the Northern Pacific Railroad; William G. T.\r\n     Shedd, the learned theologian; the late Henry J. Raymond of the\r\n     New York _Times_; John A. Kasson of Iowa, Frederick Billings, and\r\n     a host of others, eminent in all the walks of life. Its late\r\n     president, who was an \"Angell from Providence,\" and has just been\r\n     elected president of Michigan University, is heartily in favor of\r\n     the movement, and the president-elect, Matthew H. Buckham, is no\r\n     less so. With its new president and its \"new departure\" the\r\n     future bids fair even to outshine the past.\r\n\r\n     It may be well to inquire the reason why a college located in a\r\n     State regarded by outsiders \"as the most conservative of the\r\n     Union on the woman suffrage question,\" should take a step so far\r\n     in advance of what has been deemed the prevailing sentiment.\r\n     Editors who have been battling the new reform with a zeal equaled\r\n     only by that manifested against abolitionism a few years since,\r\n     can see no necessary connection between the new movement and the\r\n     general cause of woman's emancipation. Whether necessary or not,\r\n     there is a practical connection between them which is being felt\r\n     more and more every day. I assert, with no fear of contradiction\r\n     by any observing man, that Vermont is no more committed against\r\n     woman suffrage than any other State in the East, and the fact\r\n     that but one man in our late convention voted to extend the right\r\n     of suffrage to all, can well be explained when we consider the\r\n     manner of choosing delegates by towns; one town, for instance,\r\n     with twelve voters, having the same voice in the representation\r\n     that this city has with 1,500. With a popular vote upon that\r\n     question the State would give such a majority as would fairly\r\n     astonish all those who regarded the late convention as a complete\r\n     demolition of the \"reformers.\"\r\n\r\n                                             ST. ANDREW.\r\n\r\nThe following criticism of the Rev. Mr. Holmes, from the pen of a\r\nwoman, shows the growing self-assertion of a class hitherto held in\r\na condition of subordination by clerical authority. Such\r\ntergiversation in the pulpit as his has done much to emancipate\r\nwoman from the reverence she once felt for the teaching of those\r\nsupposed to be divinely ordained of heaven:\r\n\r\n                                   BENSON, Vt., June 20, 1871.\r\n\r\n     I have heard it stated from the pulpit within a year that the\r\n     woman suffrage question in Vermont is dead. Well, we believe in\r\n     the resurrection. Week by week this question of the hour and of\r\n     the age confronts those who claim to have given it decent burial.\r\n     The same clergyman who pronounced it dead has since spoken of it\r\n     as one of the \"growing evils of the times,\" and in this beautiful\r\n     summer weather he has felt called upon to preach another sermon,\r\n     ostensibly on \"marriage,\" really upon this \"dead question,\"\r\n     dragging it out to daylight again, that we might see how easily\r\n     he could bury it fifty fathoms deep--with mud. It reminded me of\r\n     Robert Laird Collier's sermon, \"The Folly of the Woman Movement,\"\r\n     in its logic and its spirit. Mr. Collier and our Mr. Holmes see\r\n     but one thing in all this struggle for truth and justice, and\r\n     that is \"free-love.\" Here are some specimens of Mr. Holmes'\r\n     assertions:\r\n\r\n          The advocates of woman's rights want, not the ballot so much\r\n          as the dissolution of the marriage tie. They propose to form\r\n          a tie for the term of five, six or seven years. Mark the men\r\n          or women who are the most strenuous advocates of woman\r\n          suffrage. They are irreligious and immoral.\r\n\r\n     Who are more strenuous advocates of woman suffrage than Mrs.\r\n     Julia Ward Howe, Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, Mrs. Isabella\r\n     Beecher Hooker, Mrs. Lucy Stone, Mrs. Lucretia Mott, Mrs.\r\n     Livermore, T. W. Higginson, Henry Ward Beecher, Bishop Simpson,\r\n     Governor Claflin, Gilbert Haven, Wendell Phillips, and scores of\r\n     others whose lives are as pure and intellects as fine as his who\r\n     dares stand in the sacred desk and call these persons\r\n     \"irreligious and immoral\"? His argument seems to be like this:\r\n     Some advocates of woman suffrage are in favor of easy divorces.\r\n     These men and women advocate woman suffrage; therefore these men\r\n     and women are in favor of easy divorces. Or, to make the matter\r\n     still plainer, some ministers of the Gospel are immoral. Mr. H.\r\n     is a minister of the Gospel; therefore Mr. H. is immoral. The\r\n     method of reasoning is the same, but it don't sound quite fair\r\n     and honorable, does it?\r\n\r\n     \"In our land woman is a queen; she is loved and cared for,\" says\r\n     Mr. Holmes. In sight from the window where I write is a sad\r\n     commentary upon this. One of these queens, so tenderly cared for,\r\n     is hoeing corn, while her five-months-old baby--the youngest of\r\n     nine children--lies on the grass while she works. Her husband is\r\n     away from home, but has left word for the \"old woman\" to \"take\r\n     care of the corn and potatoes, for he has to support the family.\"\r\n     When they are out of meat, she must go out washing and earn some,\r\n     for \"he has to support the family,\" and cannot have her idle. Not\r\n     long since they were planting corn together, she doing as much as\r\n     he. At noon, although she had a pail of milk and another of eggs,\r\n     he brought her the two hoes to carry home, as he could not be\r\n     troubled with them. Had he ever read:\r\n\r\n          \"I will be master of what is my own;\r\n          She is my goods, my chattels--\r\n          My horse, my ox, my ass, my anything\"?\r\n\r\n     \"No woman reaches such dignity as the New England wife and\r\n     mother,\" says Mr. H. Is wifehood more honorable, or motherhood\r\n     more sacred, in New England than in other places? Is to be a wife\r\n     and mother, and nothing else, the sole end and aim of woman? Or\r\n     is there not other work in God's universe which some woman may\r\n     possibly be called upon to do? Is Florence Nightingale or Anna\r\n     Dickinson less dignified than Mrs. John Smith, who happens\r\n     physically to be the mother of half-a-dozen children, but\r\n     mentally and morally is as much of a child as any of them?\r\n\r\n     \"Woman has just the sphere she wants. She has more privileges\r\n     than she could vote herself into,\" says Mr. H. Has she, indeed? I\r\n     know women, who would gladly vote themselves into the privilege\r\n     of having the custody of their own children, whose husbands are\r\n     notoriously drunken and licentious. They are pure, good women,\r\n     who, rather than part with their children, live on with men whose\r\n     very breath is pollution. I know others who would like to vote\r\n     themselves into the privilege of retaining their own hard\r\n     earnings instead of having them sacrificed by a drunken husband.\r\n     Widows have been literally turned out of doors after their\r\n     husbands' death, and the property they had helped to accumulate\r\n     divided among those who never earned it. Do you think such women\r\n     would not change the laws of inheritance if they had the power?\r\n\r\n     \"Husband and wife are one, hence one vote is sufficient,\" says\r\n     Mr. H. Follow out the reasoning, if you please. \"Both one,\" hence\r\n     one dinner is sufficient, \"both one,\" hence if a man is a member\r\n     of a church his wife is also. In plain English, \"the husband and\r\n     wife are both one,\" and the husband is that one. Now in case\r\n     _that one_ should die, is it fair, or just, or fitting, that the\r\n     widow--\"the relict\"--or, in the words of Mr. H., \"the feminine\r\n     spirit that has supplemented this masculine nature,\" whose hands\r\n     have been tied all these years, should be called upon to pay\r\n     taxes upon the share of property the law allows her? Taxation\r\n     without representation was the immediate cause of the famous\r\n     tea-party in Boston harbor, and, in fact, of a good many other\r\n     unpleasant things that followed.\r\n\r\n     \"Woman has just the sphere she wants,\" says Mr. H., closing the\r\n     discussion. No, sir, she has not. Had those young ladies in\r\n     Philadelphia who were studying medicine, and were insulted day\r\n     after day by the male medical students, the sphere they wanted?\r\n     Our American girls have been to Europe for the sake of pursuing\r\n     their studies in medicine, and have met with kindness and\r\n     courtesy, while in this land, where they are called \"queens,\"\r\n     they received only hisses. Last winter Governor Claflin of\r\n     Massachusetts--one of those \"irreligious and immoral\" advocates\r\n     of woman suffrage--reminded the gentlemen of that State who claim\r\n     to be woman's representatives in the legislature, \"that a wife in\r\n     that State is deprived of the free control of property that was\r\n     her own before marriage, and is denied an equal right in the\r\n     property accumulated during the marriage partnership; that a\r\n     married mother has no legal right to her child; and that a widow\r\n     has not equal rights with a widower.\" When woman has the sphere\r\n     she wants, these things will be changed.\r\n\r\n     As a majority of the men in this community are opposed to woman\r\n     suffrage, I will relate one circumstance that will do to \"point a\r\n     moral or adorn a tale.\" Of course, the voters in this or any\r\n     other place always elect their best men to hold office, and the\r\n     board of selectmen would naturally be the very wisest and best,\r\n     the \"_creme de la creme_.\" Now it so happens that one selectman\r\n     being away from home, there was not enough arithmetic left with\r\n     the other two to make out the tax-bills for the town, and they\r\n     hired a woman, the mother of two children, to do it for them. It\r\n     certainly took more of her time than it would for her to have\r\n     walked across the street and voted for men who could make out\r\n     their own tax-bills. Then arithmetic is not a womanly\r\n     accomplishment, like tatting, crocheting, etc. These things sink\r\n     into our hearts, and will bear fruit in due season.\r\n\r\n                                             SARAH A. GIBBS.\r\n\r\nIn 1877, July 21, Miss Thyrza F. Pangborn, for the last six years\r\nthe capable and efficient recorder in the probate office of\r\nBurlington, was appointed and sworn as a notary public. In a letter\r\nof December 7, 1872, our correspondent says:\r\n\r\n     In the year 1870, the world was somewhat startled by the fact\r\n     that in the constitutional convention, held that year in Vermont,\r\n     but one vote was cast for the enfranchisement of woman; and no\r\n     one wonders that the friends of that movement exclaimed, \"Can any\r\n     good come out of--Vermont\"? Yesterday the first biennial session\r\n     of the legislature closed its session of fifty-seven days. A bill\r\n     has been pending in each House, giving female tax-payers a right\r\n     to vote at all school-district meetings. It was advocated by Mr.\r\n     Butterfield, one of the leading members of the House, in an able\r\n     and learned speech, and received 64 votes to 103 against. Is not\r\n     that doing well for such a staid old State as Vermont, and one\r\n     where the enemies of equal suffrage supposed, two years since,\r\n     that the measure was indefinitely postponed? But this is not all.\r\n     The measure was introduced in the Senate, composed of thirty\r\n     members, who are supposed to be the balance-wheel of the General\r\n     Assembly. It was warmly discussed by several Senators, and the\r\n     vote taken, when there were three members absent, resulting in,\r\n     yeas 13, nays 14. Had the Senate been full, the vote would have\r\n     been, yeas 14,[198] nays 16. A change of one of the \"no\" votes\r\n     would have carried the measure, as the lieutenant-governor, who\r\n     presides in the Senate, would have given the casting vote in its\r\n     favor.\r\n\r\n     The supporters of the measure included some of the ablest members\r\n     of the Senate, among them the chairmen of the very important\r\n     Committees on Finance, Claims, Education, Agriculture,\r\n     Manufactures, Railroads and Printing.\r\n\r\n     Following the defeat of the above-mentioned bill came up a\r\n     measure granting to women the same right to vote as men have in\r\n     all elections everywhere in the State. It received the support of\r\n     all who voted for the school measure, save two, Mr. Mason and Mr.\r\n     Rogers, who prefer to see the first tried as an experiment in the\r\n     school meetings. You thus perceive that twelve out of our thirty\r\n     grave and reverend Senators are real out-and-out equal suffrage\r\n     men. Verily, the world moves! Another year, 1874, we hope will\r\n     carry off the measure. Meanwhile, we say, three cheers for old\r\n     Vermont, and glory enough for one day!\r\n\r\n                                             ST. ANDREW.\r\n\r\n     _Burlington, Vt._\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the School Suffrage bill passed the Vermont House of\r\nRepresentatives, with only four dissenting votes. When the bill\r\ncame to a third reading and only four men stood up for the\r\nnegative, there was so marked an expression of derision that the\r\nspeaker called for \"order,\" and reminded the House that \"no man was\r\nto be scorned for voting alone any more than with a crowd.\" The\r\naction and the voting came cheerily. More than one man, to the\r\nobjection of \"an entering wedge,\" said \"he was ready to grant the\r\nwhole.\" The bill passed the Senate triumphantly and was approved by\r\nthe governor, December 18, 1880:\r\n\r\n          Women shall have the same right to vote as men have, in all\r\n          school-district meetings and in the election of school\r\n          commissioners in towns and cities, and the same right to\r\n          hold office relating to school affairs.\r\n\r\nAn item in the _Woman's Journal_, from Vergennes, March 22, 1881,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     At the city election to-day General J. H. Lucia, a staunch friend\r\n     of woman suffrage, was elected mayor, and principally through his\r\n     management Miss Electa S. Smith has been chosen to the office of\r\n     city clerk, which office he has held for the past two years. The\r\n     legislature of 1880 authorized the election of women to the\r\n     offices of superintendent of schools and town clerk, and some of\r\n     the friends of the cause were disposed to try the working of the\r\n     law here. They selected a candidate whose ability, qualifications\r\n     and thorough fitness all had to concede, and against whom the\r\n     only objection that could be raised was her being a woman. It\r\n     took the conservatives some time to get over their surprise at\r\n     the first suggestion of her name, but they admitted the propriety\r\n     of the thing and gallantly lent a hand, so that when the election\r\n     came all the candidates who had been talked about were\r\n     conspicuous by their absence, and Miss Smith was elected by\r\n     acclamation. Surely the world does move.\r\n\r\n                                   SPRINGFIELD, February 7, 1884.\r\n\r\n     _Miss Lydia Putnam, Brattleboro', Vt.:_\r\n\r\n     Your letter is at hand. I think but few women have, as yet,\r\n     availed themselves of the privilege of voting in school meetings\r\n     in this State, and I am not able to say what the effect upon our\r\n     schools has been up to the present time.\r\n\r\n                         Very respectfully,              JUSTUS DARTT.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the above reply from the state-superintendent of\r\nthe public schools of Vermont, the Associated Press reports of\r\nevery year[199] since 1881 make mention of women being elected to\r\nschool offices in the various towns and counties of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[194] No woman in so many varied fields of action has more steadily\r\nand faithfully labored than Mrs. Nichols, as editor, speaker,\r\nteacher, farmer, in Vermont, New York, Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio,\r\nKansas, and California where she spent the closing years of her\r\nlife; and though always in circumstances of hardship and privation,\r\nyet no annual convention was held without a long letter from her\r\npen, uniformly the most cheerful and able of all that were\r\nreceived. A great soul that seemed to rise above the depressing\r\ninfluences of her surroundings! The last letter she ever wrote us\r\nwas in January, 1885, a few days before she passed away.

Hoyt of\r\n     Wyoming.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New York chapter in Volume I. closes with an account of some\r\nretrogressive legislation on the rights of married women,[200]\r\nshowing that until woman herself has a voice in legislation her\r\nrights may be conceded or withheld at the option of the ruling\r\npowers, and that her only safety is in direct representation. The\r\nchapter on \"Trials and Decisions\" in Volume II., shows the\r\ninjustice women have suffered in the courts, where they have never\r\nyet enjoyed the sacred right of trial by a jury of their own peers.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of persistent effort for the adjustment of special\r\ngrievances, many of the leaders, seeing by what an uncertain tenure\r\ntheir civil rights were maintained by the legislative and judicial\r\nauthorities, ceased to look to the State for redress, and turned to\r\nthe general government for protection in the right of suffrage, the\r\nfundamental right by which all minor privileges and immunities are\r\nprotected. Hence the annual meeting of the National Association,\r\nwhich had been regularly held in New York as one of the May\r\nanniversaries, was, from 1869, supplemented by a semi-annual\r\nconvention in Washington for special influence upon congress.\r\n\r\nUntil the war the work in New York was conducted by a central\r\ncommittee; but in the summer of 1869, the following call was issued\r\nfor a convention at Saratoga Springs, to organize a State Society:\r\n\r\n     The advocates of woman suffrage will hold a State convention at\r\n     Saratoga Springs on the thirteenth and fourteenth of July, 1869.\r\n     The specific business of this convention will be to effect a\r\n     permanent organization for the State of New York. Our friends in\r\n     the several congressional districts should at once elect their\r\n     delegates, in order that the whole State may be represented in\r\n     the convention. In districts where delegates cannot be elected,\r\n     any person can constitute himself or herself a representative.\r\n     The convention will be attended by the ablest advocates of\r\n     suffrage for woman, and addresses may be expected from Elizabeth\r\n     Cady Stanton, president of the National Association, Celia\r\n     Burleigh, president of the Brooklyn Equal Rights Association,\r\n     Matilda Joslyn Gage, advisory counsel for the State, Susan B.\r\n     Anthony, of _The Revolution_, Charlotte B. Wilbour of New York\r\n     city, and others. Every woman interested for her personal freedom\r\n     should attend this convention, and by her presence, influence and\r\n     money, aid the movement for the restoration of the rights of her\r\n     sex.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ELIZABETH B. PHELPS,\r\n                 _Vice-President for the State of New York_.\r\n     MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, _Advisory Counsel_.\r\n\r\nThe opening session of the convention was held in the spacious\r\nparlors of Congress Hall the audience composed chiefly of\r\nfashionable ladies[201] from all parts of the country, who listened\r\nwith evident interest and purchased the tracts intended for\r\ndistribution. The remaining sessions were held in Hawthorn Hall,\r\nMatilda Joslyn Gage presiding. A series of spirited resolutions was\r\nadopted, also a plan of organization presented by Charlotte B.\r\nWilbour, for a State association.[202] Many able speakers[203] were\r\npresent. The formation of this society was the result of a very\r\ngeneral agitation in different localities on several vital\r\nquestions in the preceding year:\r\n\r\n_First_--On taxation. Women being large property holders, had felt\r\nthe pressure during the war, especially of the tax on incomes, and\r\nhad resolved on resistance: Accordingly, large meetings[204] were\r\ncalled at various points, in 1868. While women of wealth were\r\norganizing to resist taxation, the working women[205] were uniting\r\nto defend their earnings, and secure better wages. It seemed for a\r\nfew months as if they were in a chronic condition of rebellion. But\r\nafter many vain struggles for redress in the iron teeth of the law,\r\nand equally vain appeals to have unjust laws amended, the women\r\nlearned the hopelessness of all efforts made by disfranchised\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n_Second_--On prostitution. For the first time in the history of the\r\ngovernment, a bill was presented in the New York legislature, in\r\n1868, proposing to license prostitution. This showed the\r\ndegradation of woman's position as no other act of legislation\r\ncould have done, and although the editors of _The Revolution_ were\r\nthe only women who publicly opposed the bill (which they did both\r\nbefore the committee of the legislature, and in their journal), yet\r\nthere was in the minds of many, a deep undercurrent of resistance\r\nto the odious provisions of that bill. Horace Greeley, too, in his\r\neditorials in the New York _Tribune_, denounced the proposition in\r\nsuch unmeasured terms that, although pressed at three different\r\nlegislative sessions, no member of the committee could be found\r\nwith sufficient moral hardihood to present the bill.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this question, the necessity of \"women as\r\npolice,\" was for some time a topic of discussion. They had proved\r\nso efficient in many cases, that it was seriously proposed to have\r\na standing force in New York and Brooklyn, to look after young\r\ngirls,[206] new to the temptations and dangers of city life. In\r\n_The Revolution_ of March 26, 1868, we find the following:\r\n\r\n     It is often asked, would you make women police officers? It has\r\n     already been done. At least a society of women exists in this\r\n     country, for the discovery of crimes, conspiracies and such\r\n     things. The chief of this band was Mrs. Kate Warn, a native of\r\n     this State, who lately died in Chicago. She was engaged in this\r\n     business, fifteen years ago, by Mr. Pinkerton, of the National\r\n     Police Agency. She did good service for many years in watching,\r\n     waylaying, exploring and detecting; especially on the critical\r\n     occasion of President Lincoln's journey to Washington in 1861. In\r\n     1865 she was sent to New Orleans, as head of the Female Police\r\n     Department there.\r\n\r\nThere was a general movement in these years for the more liberal\r\neducation of women in various departments of art and industry, as\r\nwell as in letters. First on the list stands Vassar College,\r\nfounded in 1861, richly endowed with fine grounds and spacious\r\nbuildings. We cannot estimate the civilizing influence of the\r\nthousands of young women graduating at that institution, now, as\r\ncultivated wives and mothers, presiding in households all over this\r\nland. Cornell University[207] was opened to girls in 1872, more\r\nrichly endowed than Vassar, and in every way superior in its\r\nenvironments; beautifully situated on the banks of Cayuga Lake,\r\nwith the added advantage and stimulus of the system of coeducation.\r\nTo Andrew D. White, its president, all women owe a debt of\r\ngratitude for his able and persevering advocacy of the benefits to\r\nboth sexes, of coeducation. The university at Syracuse, in which\r\nLima College was incorporated, is also open alike to boys and\r\ngirls. Rochester University,[208] Brown, Columbia, Union, Hamilton,\r\nand Hobart College at Geneva, still keep their doors barred against\r\nthe daughters of the State, and the three last, in the small number\r\nof their students, and their gradual decline, show the need of the\r\nvery influence they exclude. Could all the girls desiring an\r\neducation in and around Rochester, Geneva,[209] Clinton and\r\nSchenectady, enter these institutions, the added funds and\r\nenthusiasm they would thus receive would soon bring them renewed\r\nlife and vigor.\r\n\r\nPeter Cooper and Catharine Beecher's efforts for the working\r\nclasses of women were equally praiseworthy. Miss Beecher formed\r\n\"The American Woman's Educational Association,\" for the purpose of\r\nestablishing schools all over the country for training girls in the\r\nrudiments of learning and practical work. The Cooper Institute,\r\nfounded in 1854, by Peter Cooper, has been invaluable in its\r\nbenefits to the poorer classes of girls, in giving them advantages\r\nin the arts and sciences, in evening as well as day classes. Here\r\nboth boys and girls have free admission into all departments,\r\nincluding its valuable reading-room and library. It had long been a\r\ncherished desire of Mr. Cooper to found an institution to be\r\ndevoted forever to the union of art and science in their\r\napplication to the useful purposes of life. The School of Design is\r\nspecially for women.\r\n\r\nThe Ladies Art Association of New York was founded in 1867, now\r\nnumbering over one hundred members. One of the most important\r\nthings accomplished by this society has been the preparation of\r\nthoroughly educated teachers, many of whom are now filling\r\npositions in Southern and Western colleges.\r\n\r\n                                   NEW YORK, June 3, 1869.\r\n\r\n     EDITORS OF THE REVOLUTION: Inclosed please find the report of a\r\n     meeting of New York ladies to consider the important subject of\r\n     woman's education. The within slip will show that this is a\r\n     movement quite as earnest and pronounced as the woman suffrage\r\n     agitation of the day, and more in consonance with prevailing\r\n     public opinion. We trust that you will aid the effort by\r\n     inserting the report and resolutions into your columns, and add\r\n     at least a brief editorial notice.\r\n\r\n                    Very respectfully,       MRS. MARSHALL O. ROBERTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     IMPORTANT MEETING OF NEW YORK LADIES.--WOMAN'S EDUCATION.--On\r\n     Monday, the 31st of May, a large number of influential ladies\r\n     gathered at Dr. Taylor's, corner Sixth avenue and Thirty-eighth\r\n     street, in response to the call of the secretary of The American\r\n     Woman's Educational Association. A meeting was organized, Mrs.\r\n     Marshall O. Roberts presiding, and after a long and interesting\r\n     discussion the following resolutions were unanimously passed. It\r\n     is proper to state that the society has been an organized and\r\n     efficient power in woman's education for over twenty years. The\r\n     object of its present action is to forward a movement to secure\r\n     endowed institutions for the training of women to their special\r\n     duties and professions as men are trained for theirs,\r\n     particularly the science and duties of home-life:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That one cause of the depressed condition of\r\n          woman is the fact that the distinctive profession of her\r\n          sex, as the nurse of infancy and of the sick, as educator of\r\n          childhood, and as the chief minister of the family state,\r\n          has not been duly honored, nor such provision been made for\r\n          its scientific and practical training as is accorded to the\r\n          other sex for their professions; and that it is owing to\r\n          this neglect that women are driven to seek honor and\r\n          independence in the institutions and the professions of men.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the science of domestic economy, in its\r\n          various branches, involves more important interests than any\r\n          other human science; and that the evils suffered by women\r\n          would be extensively remedied by establishing institutions\r\n          for training woman for her profession, which shall be as\r\n          generously endowed as are the institutions of men, many of\r\n          which have been largely endowed by women.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the science of domestic economy should be\r\n          made a study in all institutions for girls; and that certain\r\n          practical employments of the family state should be made a\r\n          part of common school education, especially the art of\r\n          sewing, which is so needful for the poor; and that we will\r\n          use our influence to secure these important measures.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That every young woman should be trained to some\r\n          business by which she can earn an independent livelihood in\r\n          case of poverty.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That in addition to the various in-door\r\n          employments suitable for woman, there are other out-door\r\n          employments especially favorable to health and equally\r\n          suitable, such as raising fruits and flowers, the culture of\r\n          silk and cotton, the raising of bees and the superintendence\r\n          of dairy farms and manufactures. All of these offer avenues\r\n          to wealth and independence for women as properly as men, and\r\n          schools for imparting to women the science and practice of\r\n          these employments should be provided and as liberally\r\n          endowed as are the agricultural schools for men.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the American Woman's Educational\r\n          Association is an organization which aims to secure to women\r\n          these advantages, that its managers have our confidence, and\r\n          that we will cooeperate in its plans as far as we have\r\n          opportunity.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the Protestant clergy would greatly aid in\r\n          these efforts by preaching on the honor and duties of the\r\n          family state. In order to this, we request their attention\r\n          to a work just published by Miss Beecher and Mrs. Stowe,\r\n          entitled \"The American Woman's Home,\" which largely\r\n          discusses many important topics of this general subject,\r\n          while the authors have devoted most of their profits from\r\n          this work to promote the plans of the American Woman's\r\n          Educational Association.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That editors of the religious and secular press\r\n          will contribute important aid to an effort they must all\r\n          approve by inserting these resolutions in their columns.\r\n\r\nAmong the influences that brought new thought to the question of\r\nwoman suffrage was the establishment of _The Revolution_ in 1868.\r\nRadical and defiant in tone, it awoke friends and foes alike to\r\naction. Some denounced it, some ridiculed it, but all read it. It\r\nneeded just such clarion notes sounded forth long and loud each\r\nweek to rouse the friends of the movement from the apathy into\r\nwhich they had fallen after the war. One cannot read its glowing\r\npages to-day without appreciating the power it was just at that\r\ncrisis.[210]\r\n\r\nMiss Lucy B. Hobbs of New York was the first woman that ever\r\ngraduated in the profession of dentistry. She matriculated in the\r\nCincinnati Dental College in the fall of 1864--passing through a\r\nfull course of study, missing but two lectures, and those at the\r\nrequest of the professor of anatomy. She graduated from that\r\ninstitution in February, 1866. A letter from the dean of the\r\ncollege testifies to her worth as follows:\r\n\r\n     She was a woman of great energy and perseverance. Studious in her\r\n     habits, modest and unassuming, she had the respect and kind\r\n     regard of every member of the class and faculty. As an operator\r\n     she was not surpassed by her associates. Her opinion was asked\r\n     and her assistance sought in difficult cases almost daily by her\r\n     fellow-students. And though the class of which she was a member\r\n     was one of the largest ever in attendance, it excelled all\r\n     previous ones in good order and decorum--a condition largely due\r\n     to the presence of a lady. In the final examination she was\r\n     second to none.\r\n\r\nHaving received her diploma, she opened an office in Iowa; from\r\nthence she removed to Chicago, and practiced successfully. The\r\nfollowing letter from Mrs. Taylor (formerly Miss Hobbs) gives\r\nfurther interesting details. Writing to Matilda Joslyn Gage, she\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     I am grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to place in\r\n     history the fact of my study of dentistry. I was born in Franklin\r\n     county, New York, in 1833. You ask my reason for entering the\r\n     profession. It was to be independent. I first studied medicine,\r\n     but did not like the practice. My preceptor, Professor Cleveland,\r\n     advised me to try dentistry, and I commenced with Dr. Samuel\r\n     Warde of Cincinnati, finishing my studies in March, 1861. At that\r\n     time the faculty of the Ohio Dental College would not permit me\r\n     to attend, and there was not a college in the United States that\r\n     would admit me, and no amount of persuasion could change their\r\n     minds. So far as I know, I was the first woman who had ever taken\r\n     instruction of a private tutor.\r\n\r\n     I went to Iowa to commence practice, and was so successful that\r\n     the dentists of the State insisted I should be allowed to attend\r\n     the college. Their efforts prevailed, and I graduated from the\r\n     Ohio Dental College at Cincinnati in the spring of 1866--the\r\n     first woman in the world to take a diploma from a dental college.\r\n     I am a New-Yorker by birth, but I love my adopted country--the\r\n     West. To it belongs the credit of making it possible for women to\r\n     be recognized in the dental profession on equal terms with men.\r\n     Should you wish any further proof, write to Dr. Watt, who was\r\n     professor of chemistry at the time I graduated, and I know he\r\n     will take pleasure in giving you any additional information.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1866 a system of safe-deposit companies was inaugurated\r\nin New York, which has proved a boon to women, enabling them to\r\nkeep any private papers they may wish to preserve. In 1880, we find\r\nthe following in the _National Citizen_:\r\n\r\n     A ladies' exchange for railroad and mining stocks has been\r\n     started at 71 Broadway, New York. The rooms are provided with an\r\n     indicator, desks and such other conveniences as are required for\r\n     business. Messenger boys drop in and out, and a telephone\r\n     connects with the office of a prominent Wall-street brokerage\r\n     firm. Miss Mary E. Gage, daughter of Frances Dana Gage, is the\r\n     manager and proprietor of the business. In reply to the inquiries\r\n     of a _Graphic_ reporter, Miss Gage said she had found so much\r\n     inconvenience and annoyance in transacting her own operations in\r\n     stocks that she concluded to establish an office. After Miss Gage\r\n     was fairly settled, other women who labored under the same\r\n     disadvantages, began to drop in, their number increasing daily. A\r\n     ladies' stock exchange also exists at No. 40 Fourth street, under\r\n     charge of Mrs. Favor. The banking houses of Henry Clews and the\r\n     wealthy Russell Sage are said to be working in union with this\r\n     exchange. In January we chronicled the formation of a woman's\r\n     mining company and this month of a woman's stock exchange, each\r\n     of them an evidence of the wide range of business women are\r\n     entering.\r\n\r\nIn _The Revolution_ of May 14, 1868, we find the following:\r\n\r\n     SOROSIS.--This is the name of a new club of literary women, who\r\n     meet once a month and lunch at Delmonico's, to discuss questions\r\n     of art, science, literature and government. Alice Carey, who is\r\n     president, in her opening speech states the object of the club,\r\n     which is summed up in this brief extract:\r\n\r\n          We have proposed the inculcation of deeper and broader ideas\r\n          among women, proposed to teach them to think for themselves\r\n          and get their opinions at first hand, not so much because it\r\n          is their right as because it is their duty. We have also\r\n          proposed to open new avenues of employment to women--to make\r\n          them less dependent and less burdensome--to lift them out of\r\n          unwomanly self-distrust and disqualifying diffidence into\r\n          womanly self-respect and self-knowledge. To teach them to\r\n          make all work honorable, by each doing the share that falls\r\n          to her, or that she may work out to herself agreeably to her\r\n          own special aptitude, cheerfully and faithfully--not going\r\n          down to it, but bringing it up to her. We have proposed to\r\n          enter our protest against all idle gossip, against all\r\n          demoralizing and wicked waste of time, also, against the\r\n          follies and the tyrannies of fashion, against all external\r\n          impositions and disabilities; in short, against each and\r\n          every thing that opposes the full development and use of the\r\n          faculties conferred upon us by our Creator.\r\n\r\n     We most heartily welcome all movements for the cultivation of\r\n     individual thought and character in woman, and would recommend\r\n     the formation of such clubs throughout the country. The editors\r\n     of the New York press have made known their dissatisfaction that\r\n     no gentlemen were to be admitted into this charmed circle. After\r\n     a calm and dispassionate discussion of this question, it was\r\n     decided to exclude gentlemen, not because their society was not\r\n     most desirable and calculated to add brilliancy to the club, but\r\n     from a fear lest the natural reverence of woman for man might\r\n     embarrass her in beginning to reason and discuss; lest she should\r\n     be awed to silence by their superior presence. It was not because\r\n     they love man less, but their own improvement more. For the\r\n     comfort of these ostracised ones, we would suggest a hope for the\r\n     future. After these ladies become familiar with parliamentary\r\n     tactics, and the grave questions that are to come before them for\r\n     consideration, it is proposed to admit gentlemen to the\r\n     galleries, that they may enjoy the same privileges vouchsafed to\r\n     the fair sex in the past, to look down upon the feast, to listen\r\n     to the speeches, and to hear \"the pale, thoughtful brow,\" \"the\r\n     silken moustache,\" \"the flowing locks,\" \"the manly gait and form\"\r\n     toasted in prose and verse.\r\n\r\nThis club has met regularly ever since the day of its inauguration,\r\nand has been remarkable for the harmony maintained by its members.\r\nMrs. Charlotte Wilbour was president for several years, until she\r\nwent to reside in Paris, in 1874. Since that time Mrs. Croly has\r\nbeen, from year to year, elected to that office. Beginning with 12\r\nmembers,[211] this club now numbers 320.\r\n\r\nThe most respected live-stock reporter in New York is a woman. Miss\r\nMiddie Morgan, pronounced the best judge of horned cattle in this\r\ncountry. She can tell the weight of a beef on foot at a glance, and\r\nreports the cattle market for the New York _Times_. A correspondent\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     Her father was a cattle-dealer, and taught her to handle\r\n     fearlessly the animals he delighted in. She learned to tell at a\r\n     glance the finest points of live-stock, and to doctor bovine and\r\n     equine ailments with the utmost skill. With all this, she became\r\n     a proficient in Italian and French, and a terse and rapid writer.\r\n     A few years ago, after her father's death, she traveled in Italy\r\n     with an invalid sister, having an eye to her pet passion--the\r\n     horse. While there she met Prince Poniatowsky, also an ardent\r\n     admirer of that animal. He mentioned her zooelogical\r\n     accomplishments to Victor Emanuel, and the consequence was Miss\r\n     Middie was deputed by His Majesty to purchase a hundred or so of\r\n     fine horses. She had charge of the blood-horses of King Victor\r\n     Emanuel, who owns the finest stud in Europe, and breeds horses of\r\n     a superior shape, vigor and fire. He beats Grant in his\r\n     admiration for that noble animal. When she decided to come to\r\n     this country, she made known the fact to Hon. George P. Marsh,\r\n     our minister to Italy; and he gave her a letter of recommendation\r\n     to Mr. Bigelow, of the _Times_, who employed her. She is an\r\n     expert among all kinds of animals. Her judgment about the\r\n     different breeds is sought after and much quoted. She can discuss\r\n     the nice points about cattle as easily as Rosa Bonheur can paint\r\n     them.[212]\r\n\r\nFrom the Woman's Journal, Oct. 1, 1870:\r\n\r\n     Miss Barkaloo, the lady just admitted to the St. Louis bar as a\r\n     lawyer, and who has received a license to practice as\r\n     attorney-at-law from the Supreme Court of that State, is a native\r\n     of Brooklyn, N. Y., and is a woman of more than ordinary ability.\r\n     Two years ago, after having read Blackstone and other elementary\r\n     law-books, she made application for admission as a student at\r\n     Columbia College, New York, and was promptly refused. Nothing\r\n     daunted, she went to St. Louis, where she was admitted to the Law\r\n     School. For eighteen months she assiduously devoted her energies\r\n     to the study of the science, and her fellow-students all agreed\r\n     in declaring her by far the brightest member of the class. That\r\n     there was no question of her ability was clearly shown at her\r\n     examination. Judge Knight, although overflowing with gallantry,\r\n     gave the lady no quarter. The most abstruse and erudite questions\r\n     were propounded to the applicant, but not once did the judge\r\n     catch the fair student tripping. Miss Barkaloo was about 22 years\r\n     of age, of a fine figure, intelligent face and large, expressive\r\n     eyes. The St. Louis papers of last week reported her sudden death\r\n     of typhoid fever. According to custom, a meeting of the members\r\n     of the St. Louis bar was held to take suitable action and pay\r\n     respect to her memory. It was the first meeting of the kind in\r\n     the United States, and was largely attended, not only by the\r\n     young members of the bar, but by the most distinguished\r\n     attorneys. Miss Phoebe Couzins, herself a member of the Law\r\n     School, was in attendance, attired in deep mourning for the\r\n     recent death of a beloved sister. The following resolutions were\r\n     adopted:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That in the death of Miss Helena Barkaloo we\r\n          deplore the loss of the first of her sex ever admitted to\r\n          the bar of Missouri.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That in her erudition, industry and enterprise\r\n          we have to regret the loss of one who, in the morning of her\r\n          career, bade fair to reflect credit on our profession, and a\r\n          new honor upon her sex.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That our sympathy and condolence be extended to\r\n          the relatives of the deceased.\r\n\r\n     Major Lucien Eaton, into whose office she had entered to seek\r\n     opportunities of perfecting herself in the knowledge of her\r\n     profession, said  that--\r\n\r\n          He had been requested by an accomplished lady of St. Louis\r\n          to afford her that opportunity, and at first had hesitated\r\n          to do so; yet he felt that she should have a trial, and\r\n          when he took her into his office his conduct met with the\r\n          approbation of the legal fraternity generally. That\r\n          fraternity cordially sympathized with the efforts she was\r\n          making, and both old lawyers and young ones tried to put\r\n          business into her hands, the taking of depositions and other\r\n          such work as she could perform. He testified to finding her\r\n          a true woman; modest and retiring, carefully shunning all\r\n          unnecessary publicity, and avoiding all display. She was\r\n          earnest in her studies, and being gifted with a fine\r\n          intellect and a good judgment, gave promise of great\r\n          attainments. He had never known a student more assiduous in\r\n          study; she wanted to become mistress of her profession. Her\r\n          death is a calamity, not to her friends alone, but to all\r\n          who are making an effort for the enlargement of woman's\r\n          sphere.\r\n\r\nAfter the closing of the doors of the Geneva Medical School to\r\nwomen, the Central Medical College of Syracuse was the first to\r\nadmit them. Four were graduated in 1852. Since then the two medical\r\ncolleges in New York city have graduated hundreds of women. Among\r\nthe many in successful practice are Clemence S. Lozier, Emily\r\nBlackwell, Mary Putnam Jacobi, New York; Eliza P. Mosher, Brooklyn;\r\nSarah R. A. Dolley, Anna H. Searing, Fannie F. Hamilton, Rochester;\r\nAmanda B. Sanford, Auburn; Eveline P. Ballintine, Le Roy; Rachel E.\r\nGleason, Elmira.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1870, the New York City Society was formed, with efficient\r\nofficers,[213] and pleasant rooms, at 16 Union Square, where\r\nmeetings were regularly held on Friday afternoon of each week.\r\nThese meetings were well attended and sustained with increasing\r\ninterest from month to month. This society held its first meeting\r\nNovember 27, 1871, which was addressed by Mrs. Julia Ward Howe; and\r\non January 13, 1872, another, addressed by Jennie Collins, the\r\nindefatigable Bostonian who has done so much for the benefit of the\r\nworking girls. A series of meetings was held under the auspices of\r\nthis association in many of the chief cities around New York and on\r\nthe Hudson, the chief speakers being the officers of the\r\nassociation. An active German society was soon after formed, with\r\nMrs. Augusta Lillienthal, president, and Mrs. Matilda F. Wendt,\r\nsecretary. The latter published a paper, _Die Neue Zeit_, devoted\r\nto woman suffrage. She was also the correspondent of several\r\nleading journals in Germany. The society held its first public\r\nmeeting March 21, 1872, in Turner Hall, Mrs. Wendt presiding. Mrs.\r\nLillienthal, Mrs. Clara Neyman and Dr. Adolphe Doney were the\r\nspeakers. Clara Neyman became afterwards a popular speaker in many\r\nsuffrage and free-religious associations.\r\n\r\nPetitions were rolled up by both the German and American societies\r\nto the legislature, praying for the right of suffrage, and on\r\nApril 3, 1871, the petitioners[214] were granted a hearing, before\r\nthe Judiciary Committee of the Assembly, Hon. L. Bradford Prince\r\npresiding. Mrs. Wilbour's able address made a most favorable\r\nimpression. The question was referred to the Judiciary Committee.\r\nThe majority report was adverse, the minority, signed by Robert A.\r\nStrahan and C. P. Vedder, favorable.\r\n\r\nA grand demonstration was made April 26, 1872, in Cooper Institute,\r\nintended specially to emphasize the claims of wives and mothers to\r\nthe ballot, and to show that the City Association had no sympathy\r\nwith any theories of free-love. Five thousand cards of invitation\r\nwere distributed.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 women attempted to vote in different parts of the State,\r\namong whom were Matilda Joslyn Gage at Fayetteville, and Mrs.\r\nLouise Mansfield at Nyack, but were repulsed. In 1872 others did\r\nvote under the fourteenth amendment, conspicuously Susan B.\r\nAnthony, who, as an example for the rest, was arrested, tried,\r\nconvicted and fined.[215] Mrs. Gage published a woman's rights\r\ncatechism to answer objections made at that time to woman's voting,\r\nwhich proved a valuable campaign document. We find the names of\r\nMary R. Pell of Flushing, Helen M. Loder of Poughkeepsie, and\r\nElizabeth B. Whitney of Harlem, frequently mentioned at this time\r\nfor their valuable services.\r\n\r\nThe following items show the varied capacity of women for many\r\nemployments:\r\n\r\n     In March, 1872, Miss Charlotte E. Ray (colored) of New York, was\r\n     graduated at the Howard University Law School, and admitted to\r\n     practice in the courts of the District of Columbia at\r\n     Washington.--The headquarters of the Women's National Relief\r\n     Association is in New York; its object is supplying government\r\n     stations along the coast with beds, blankets, warm clothing and\r\n     other necessaries for shipwrecked persons.----Miss Leggett, for a\r\n     long time proprietor of a book and paper store in New York,\r\n     established a home, in 1878, for women, on Clinton Square, which\r\n     is in all respects antipodal to Stewart's Hotel. It is governed\r\n     by no stringent rules or regulations. No woman is liable without\r\n     cause, at the mere caprice of the founder, to be suddenly\r\n     required to leave, as was the case in Judge Hilton's home. On the\r\n     contrary, it is the object of the founder to provide a _real_\r\n     home for women. The house is not only provided with a library,\r\n     piano, etc., but its inmates are allowed to bring their\r\n     sewing-machines, hang pictures upon the walls, put up private\r\n     book-racks, etc. The price, too, but $4 a week, falls more nearly\r\n     within the means of laboring women than the $6 to $10 of the\r\n     Stewart Hotel.----The first penny lunch-room in New York was\r\n     established by a woman, who made it a source of revenue.----The\r\n     inventor of the submarine telescope, a woman, has received\r\n     $10,000 for her invention.----Deborah Powers, now over ninety\r\n     years of age, is the head of a large oil-cloth manufactory in\r\n     Troy. Her sons are engaged in business with her, but she, still\r\n     bright and active, remains at the head of the firm. This is the\r\n     largest oil-cloth factory in the United States. She was left a\r\n     widow with three sons, with a heavy mortgage on her estate. She\r\n     secured an extension of time, built up the business and educated\r\n     her sons to the work. She is also president of a bank.----A\r\n     successful nautical school in New York is conducted by two\r\n     ladies, Mrs. Thorne and her daughter, Mrs. Brownlow. These ladies\r\n     have made several voyages and studied navigation, both\r\n     theoretically and practically. During the late war they prepared\r\n     for the navy 2,000 mates and captains bringing their knowledge of\r\n     navigation up to the standard required by the strict examiners of\r\n     the naval board.----Mrs. Wilson, since a New York custom-house\r\n     inspector, took charge, in 1872, of her husband's ship, disabled\r\n     in a terrific gale off Newfoundland in which his collar-bone was\r\n     broken and a portion of the crew badly hurt. The main-mast having\r\n     been cut down she rigged a jury-mast, and after twenty-one days\r\n     brought ship and crew safe to port.\r\n\r\n     Miss Jennie Turner, a short-hand writer of New York, is a notary\r\n     public. In a recent law-suit some of the papers were \"sworn to\"\r\n     before her in her official capacity, and one of the attorneys\r\n     claimed that it was not verified, inasmuch as a woman \"could not\r\n     legally hold public office.\" The judge decided that the paper\r\n     must be accepted as properly verified, and said that the only way\r\n     to oust her was in a direct action by the attorney-general. The\r\n     judge said:\r\n\r\n          Whether a female is capable of holding public office has\r\n          never been decided by the courts of this State, and is a\r\n          question about which legal minds may well differ. The\r\n          constitution regulates the right of suffrage and limits it\r\n          to \"male\" citizens. Disabilities are not favored, and are\r\n          seldom extended by implication, from which it may be argued\r\n          that if it required the insertion of the term \"male\" to\r\n          exclude female citizens of lawful age from the right of\r\n          suffrage, a similar limitation would be required to\r\n          disqualify them from holding office. Citizenship is a\r\n          condition or status and has no relation to age or sex. It\r\n          may be contended that it was left to the good sense of the\r\n          executive and to the electors to determine whether or not\r\n          they would select females to office, and that the power\r\n          being lodged in safe hands was beyond the danger of abuse.\r\n          If, on the other hand, it be seriously contended that the\r\n          constitution, by necessary implication, disqualifies females\r\n          from holding office, it must follow as a necessary\r\n          consequence that the act of the legislature permitting\r\n          females to serve as school officers, and all other\r\n          legislative enactments of like import removing such\r\n          disqualification, are unconstitutional and void. In this\r\n          same connection it may be argued that if the use of the\r\n          personal pronoun \"he\" in the constitution does not exclude\r\n          females from public office, its use in the statute can have\r\n          no greater effect. The statute, like the constitution, in\r\n          prescribing the qualifications for office, omits the word\r\n          \"male,\" leaving the question whether female citizens of\r\n          lawful age are included or excluded, one of construction.\r\n\r\n     Miss Anna Ballard, a reporter on the staff of the New York _Sun_,\r\n     was elected a member of the Press Club, in 1877, by a vote of 24\r\n     to 10. Within the last ten years women contributors to the press\r\n     have become numerous. The book-reviewer of the _Herald_ is a\r\n     woman; one of the book-reviewers of the _Tribune_, one of its\r\n     most valued correspondents and several of its regular\r\n     contributors are women; the agricultural and market reporter of\r\n     the New York _Times_ is a woman; the New York _Sun's_ fashion\r\n     writer is a woman, and also one of its most industrious and\r\n     sagacious reporters. Female correspondents flood the evening\r\n     papers with news from Washington. We instance these not at all as\r\n     a complete catalogue; for there are, we doubt not, more than a\r\n     hundred women known and recognized in and about Printing-house\r\n     Square as regular contributors to the columns of the daily and\r\n     weekly press. As a rule they are modest, reputable pains-taking\r\n     servants of the press; and it is generally conceded that if they\r\n     are willing to put up with the inconveniences attending\r\n     journalistic work, it is no part of men's duty to interfere with\r\n     their attempt to earn an honest livelihood in a profession which\r\n     has so many avenues as yet uncrowded. Miss Ellen A. Martin,\r\n     formerly of Jamestown, N. Y., a graduate of the Law School of Ann\r\n     Arbor, in 1875, was admitted to the bar by the Supreme Court of\r\n     Illinois, at the January term, and is practicing in Chicago,\r\n     occupying an office with Miss Perry, Room 39, No. 143 La Salle\r\n     street. Mrs. Martha J. Lamb was the first woman ever admitted to\r\n     membership in the New York State Historical Society. Her \"History\r\n     of New York City\" is recognized as a standard authority, and has\r\n     already taken rank among the great histories of the world.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1872 the presidential campaign agitated the\r\ncountry. As Horace Greeley, who was opposed to woman suffrage, was\r\nrunning against Grant and Wilson, who were in favor, and as the\r\nRepublican platform contained a plank promising some consideration\r\nfor the loyal women of the nation, a great demonstration was held\r\nin Cooper Institute, New York, October 7. The large hall was\r\ncrowded by an excited throng. Hon. Luther R. Marsh presided. The\r\nspeakers[216] were all unusually happy. Mrs. Blake's[217] address\r\nwas applauded to a recall, when she went forward and asked the\r\naudience to give three cheers for the woman suffrage candidates,\r\nGrant and Wilson, which they did with hearty good will.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1873 a commission was sitting at Albany to\r\nrevise the constitution of New York. As it seemed fitting that\r\nwomen should press their claims to the ballot, memorials were\r\npresented and hearings requested by both the State and City\r\nsocieties. Accordingly Mr. Silliman, the chairman, appointed\r\nFebruary 18, to hear the memorialists. A large delegation of ladies\r\nwent from New York.[218] The commission was holding its sessions in\r\nthe common-council chamber, and when the time arrived for the\r\nhearing the room was crowded with an attentive audience. The\r\nmembers of the Committee on Suffrage were all present, Mr. Silliman\r\npresided. Matilda Joslyn Gage represented the State association,\r\nspeaking upon the origin of government and the rights pertaining\r\nthereto. Mrs. Wilbour and Mrs. Blake represented the New York City\r\nSociety, and each alike made a favorable impression. The Albany\r\n_Evening Journal_ gave a large space to a description of the\r\noccasion. The respectful hearing, however, was the beginning and\r\nthe end, as far as could be seen, of all impression made on the\r\ncommittee, which coolly recommended that suffrage be secured to\r\ncolored men by ratifying the fifteenth amendment, while making no\r\nrecognition whatever of the women of the State. A memorial was at\r\nonce sent to the legislature and another hearing was granted on\r\nFebruary 27. Mrs. Blake[219] was the only speaker on that occasion.\r\nThe Hon. Bradford Prince, of Queens, presided. At the close of Mrs.\r\nBlake's remarks James W. Husted of Westchester, in a few earnest\r\nwords, avowed himself henceforth a champion of the cause. Shortly\r\nafterwards the Hon. George West presented a constitutional\r\namendment giving to every woman possessed of $250 the right to\r\nvote, thus placing the women of the State in the same position with\r\nthe colored men before the passage of the fifteenth amendment; but\r\neven this was denied. The amendment was referred to the Judiciary\r\nCommittee and there entombed. Large meetings[220] were held at\r\nRobinson Hall during the winter, and at Apollo Hall in May, and in\r\ndifferent localities about New York.\r\n\r\nJuly 2, 1873, an indignation meeting was held by the City Society\r\nto protest against the sentence pronounced by Judge Hunt in the\r\ncase of Susan B. Anthony. De Garmo Hall was crowded. The platform\r\nwas decorated with the United States flag draped with black\r\nbunting, while on each side were banners, one bearing the\r\ninscription, \"Respectful Consideration for a Loyal Woman's Vote!\r\n$100 Fine!\" the other, \"Shall One Federal Judge Abolish Trial by\r\nJury?\" Dr. Clemence Lozier presided, and Mrs. Devereux Blake made a\r\nstirring speech reviewing Miss Anthony's trial and Judge Hunt's\r\ndecision.[221] Mr. Hamilton Wilcox made a manly protest against\r\nJudge Hunt's high-handed act of oppression, and Mrs. Marie Rachel\r\nmade another, in behalf of the German association.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1873, Mrs. Devereux Blake made an effort to open the\r\ndoors of Columbia College to women. A class of four young\r\nladies[222] united in asking admission. Taking them with her, Mrs.\r\nBlake went before the president and faculty, who gave her a\r\nrespectful hearing. She argued that the charter of the college\r\nitself declared that it was founded for \"the education of the youth\r\nof the city\", and that the word _youth_ was defined in all\r\ndictionaries as \"young persons of both sexes,\" so that by its very\r\nfoundation it was intended that girls as well as boys should enjoy\r\nthe benefits of the university, and it was no more than just that\r\nthey should, seeing that the original endowment was by the \"rectors\r\nand inhabitants of the city of New York,\" one-half of these\r\ninhabitants being women. Mrs. Blake's[223] application was referred\r\nto \"the Committee on the Course of Instruction,\" and after some\r\nweeks of consideration was refused, on the ground that \"it was\r\ninexpedient,\" the Rev. Morgan Dix being especially active in his\r\nopposition. However, soon after this, the lectures of the college\r\nwere open to ladies, and a few years later President Barnard warmly\r\nrecommended that young women should be admitted as students to all\r\nthe privileges of the university.\r\n\r\nA Woman's Congress was organized at New York, October 15, 16, 17,\r\n1873, in the Union League Theater. Representative women[224] were\r\nthere from all parts of the country. Its object was similar to the\r\nsocial science organizations--the discussion of a wider range of\r\nsubjects than could be tolerated on the platforms of any specific\r\nreform. Mary A. Livermore presided, and the meeting was considered\r\na great success. The speeches and proceedings were published in\r\npamphlet form, and still are from year to year. This had been an\r\nidea long brewing in many minds, and was at last realized through\r\nthe organizing talent of Mrs. Charlotte B. Wilbour, the originator\r\nof Sorosis. From year to year they have held regular meetings in\r\nthe chief cities of the different States.\r\n\r\nDr. Clemence Lozier,[225] president of the city society, early\r\nopened her spacious parlors to the monthly meetings, where they\r\nhave been held for many years. This association has been active and\r\nvigilant, taking note of and furthering every step of progress in\r\nChurch and State. Mrs. Lozier and Mrs. Blake have worked most\r\neffectively together, the former furnishing the sinews of war, and\r\nthe latter making the attack all along the line, to the terror of\r\nthe faint-hearted.\r\n\r\nThe era of centennial celebrations was now approaching, and it was\r\nproposed to hold a suitable commemoration on the one-hundredth\r\nanniversary of the Boston tea-party, December 16, 1873. Union\r\nLeague Theater was, on the appointed evening, filled to its utmost\r\ncapacity. The platform was decorated with flowers and filled with\r\nladies, Dr. Lozier presiding. Miss Anthony was the speaker of the\r\nevening, and made a most effective address; Helen Potter gave a\r\nrecitation; Hannah M'L. Shepherd read letters of sympathy; Mrs.\r\nBlake made a short closing address, and presented a series of\r\nresolutions, couched in precisely the same language as that adopted\r\nby our ancestors in protesting against taxation without\r\nrepresentation:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That as an expression of the sentiments of the\r\n     tax-paying women of New York, we reiterate, as applied to\r\n     ourselves, the declaration contained in the bill of rights put\r\n     forth by our ancestors 100 years ago: _First_--That the women of\r\n     the country are entitled to equal rights and privileges with the\r\n     men; _Second_--That it is inseparably essential to the freedom of\r\n     a people, and the undoubted right of all men and women, that no\r\n     taxes be imposed on them but by their own consent, given in\r\n     person or by their representatives; _Third_--That the only\r\n     representatives of these women are persons chosen by themselves,\r\n     and that no taxes ever have been or can be constitutionally\r\n     imposed upon them but by legislatures composed of persons so\r\n     chosen.\r\n\r\nThe report of the State assessors[226] of 1883 brought forcibly to\r\nview the injustice done in taxing non-voters. At their meeting with\r\nthe supervisors of Onondaga county, Mr. Pope of Fabius said: \"Mrs.\r\nAndrews is assessed too much.\" Mr. Hadley replied: \"Well, Mr.\r\nBriggs says that is the way all the women are assessed.\" Mr. Briggs\r\nresponded: \"Yes, that is the way we find the assessors treat the\r\nwomen; they can't vote, you know! I am in favor of letting the\r\nwomen vote now.\"\r\n\r\nTwo women in the village of Batavia were assessed for more personal\r\nproperty than the entire assessment of like property, exclusive of\r\ncorporations, in the city of Rochester with a population of 70,000!\r\nWhile declaring they had found very little personal property\r\nassessed, Mr. Fowler said: \"We found some cases where town\r\nassessors had taxed the personal property of women, and one case\r\nof a ward who was assessed to full value, while upon the guardian's\r\nproperty there was no assessment at all.\" This report not only\r\nproved a good woman suffrage document, but the work done by the\r\nState assessors, Messrs. Hadley, Briggs and Fowler, convinced them\r\npersonally of woman's need of the ballot for the protection of her\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1874, memorials from societies in different parts\r\nof the State were sent to the legislature, asking \"that all taxes\r\ndue from women be remitted until they are allowed to vote.\" The\r\nmost active of these anti-tax societies was the one formed in\r\nRochester through the efforts of Mrs. Lewia C. Smith, whose\r\nearnestness and fidelity in this, as in many another good word and\r\nwork, have been such as to command the admiration even of\r\nopponents--a soul of that sweet charity that makes no account of\r\nself. A hearing was appointed for the memorialists on January 24,\r\nand the journals[227] made honorable mention of the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe centennial was approaching and the notes of preparation were\r\nheard on all sides. The women who understood their status as\r\ndisfranchised citizens in a republic, regarded the coming event as\r\none for them of humiliation rather than rejoicing, inasmuch as the\r\nclose of the first century of the nation's existence found one half\r\nthe people still political slaves. At the February meeting of the\r\nassociation, Mrs. Blake presented the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the members of this society do hereby pledge\r\n     themselves not to aid either by their labor, time or money, the\r\n     proposed celebration of the independence of the men of the\r\n     nation, unless before July 4, 1876, the women of the land shall\r\n     be guaranteed their political freedom.\r\n\r\nIn their own way, however, the members of the society intended to\r\nobserve such centennials as were fitting, and so preparation was\r\nmade for a suitable commemoration of the battle of Lexington. They\r\nheld a meeting[228] in the Union League Theatre, the evening of\r\nApril 19, to protest against their disfranchisement. The journals\r\ncontained fair reports, with the exception of _The Tribune_, which\r\nsent no reporter, and closed its account next day of many\r\nobservances elsewhere by saying, \"there was no celebration in New\r\nYork city.\" Several of the papers published Mrs. Blake's speech:\r\n\r\n     Just as the first rays of dawn stole across our city this\r\n     morning, the century was complete since the founders of this\r\n     nation made their first great stand for liberty. The early April\r\n     sunshine a hundred years ago saw a group of men and boys gathered\r\n     together, \"a few rods north of the meeting-house,\" in the\r\n     Massachusetts village of Lexington. Un-uniformed and\r\n     undisciplined, standing in the chilly morning, that handful of\r\n     patriots represented the great Republic which on that day was to\r\n     spring from their martyrdom. The rebellious colonists had\r\n     collected in the hamlets near Boston some military stores; these\r\n     the British officers in command at Boston resolved should be\r\n     seized and destroyed. Warned of their design Paul Revere made his\r\n     famous ride to arouse the country to resistance, and in the dead\r\n     of night Adams and Hancock went out to summon their comrades to\r\n     arms. As the last stars vanished before the dawn, the drum beat\r\n     to summon the patriots to action, and in response a little band\r\n     of about eighty men and boys assembled on the village green. Few\r\n     as they were in numbers, they presented a brave front as the\r\n     British regulars came up the quiet street, 200 strong. What\r\n     followed was not a battle, but a butchery. The minute-men refused\r\n     to surrender to Major Pitcairn's haughty demand, and a volley of\r\n     musketry, close and deadly, was poured on this devoted band. In\r\n     response only a few random shots were fired, which did absolutely\r\n     no harm, and then, seeing the hopelessness of resistance, the\r\n     commander of the minute-men ordered them to disperse. The\r\n     British, elated with their easy victory, pushed on toward\r\n     Concord, thinking that there another speedy success awaited them.\r\n     In this they soon bitterly learned their error. Although they\r\n     were reinforced on the way, when they reached that village they\r\n     were met by such a resistance as drove them back, broken and\r\n     disorganized, on the road they had so proudly followed in the\r\n     morning. Concord nobly avenged the slaughter at Lexington.\r\n\r\n     So much for what men did on that day, and let us see what share\r\n     the women had in its dangers and its sorrows. Jonathan Harris was\r\n     shot in front of his own house, while his wife was watching him\r\n     from a window, seeing him fall with such anguish as no poor words\r\n     of mine can describe. He struggled to his feet, the blood gushing\r\n     from a wound in his breast, staggered forward a few paces and\r\n     fell again, and then crawled on his hands and knees to his\r\n     threshold only to expire just as his wife reached him. Did not\r\n     this woman bear her portion of the martyrdom? Isaac Davis, a man\r\n     in the prime of life, went forth from his home in the morning,\r\n     and before the afternoon sunlight had grown yellow, was brought\r\n     back to it dead, and was laid, pale and cold, in his wife's bed,\r\n     only three hours after he had left her with a solemn benediction\r\n     of farewell. Did not this woman also suffer? She was left a widow\r\n     in the very flower of her youth, and for seventy years she\r\n     faithfully mourned his taking off! Nor were these the only ones;\r\n     for every man who fell that day, some woman's heart was wrung.\r\n     There were others who endured actual physical hardship and\r\n     suffering. Hannah Adams lay in bed with an infant only a week old\r\n     when the British reached her house in their disorderly retreat\r\n     to Boston; they forced her to leave her sick room and to crawl\r\n     into an adjoining corn shed, while they burned her house to ashes\r\n     in her sight. Three companies of British troops went to the house\r\n     of Major Barrett and demanded food. Mrs. Barrett served them as\r\n     well as she was able, and when she was offered compensation,\r\n     refused it, saying gently, \"We are commanded if our enemy hunger\r\n     to feed him.\" So, in toil or suffering or anguish the women\r\n     endured their share of the sorrows of that day. Do they not\r\n     deserve a share of its glories also? The battles of Lexington and\r\n     Concord form an era in our country's history. When, driven to\r\n     desperation by a long course of oppression, the people first\r\n     resolved to revolt against the mother country. Discontent,\r\n     resentment and indignation had grown stronger month by month\r\n     among the hardy settlers of the land, until they culminated in\r\n     the most splendid act of audacity that the world has ever seen. A\r\n     few colonies, scattered at long intervals along the Atlantic\r\n     seaboard, dared to defy the proudest nation in Europe, and a few\r\n     rustics, undisciplined, and almost unarmed, actually ventured to\r\n     encounter in battle that army which had boasted its conquests\r\n     over the flower of European chivalry. What unheard of oppressions\r\n     drove these people to the mad attempt? What unheard of atrocities\r\n     had the rulers of these people practiced, what unjust\r\n     confiscations of property, what cruel imprisonments and wicked\r\n     murders? None of all these; the people of this land were not\r\n     starving or dying under the iron heel of an Alva or a\r\n     Robespierre, but their civil liberties had been denied, their\r\n     political freedom refused, and rather than endure the loss of\r\n     these precious things, they were willing to encounter danger and\r\n     to brave death. The men and women who suffered at Concord and at\r\n     Lexington 100 years ago to-day, were martyrs to the sacred cause\r\n     of personal liberty! Looking over the records of the past we\r\n     find, again and again repeated, the burden of their complaints.\r\n     Not that they were starving or dying, but that they were taxed\r\n     without their consent, and that they were denied personal\r\n     representation.\r\n\r\n     The congress which assembled at Philadelphia in 1774, declared\r\n     that \"the foundation of liberty and of all free governments is\r\n     the right of the people to participate in their legislative\r\n     council\"; and the House of Burgesses, assembled in Virginia in\r\n     the same year, asserted \"That a determined system is formed and\r\n     pressed for reducing us to slavery, by subjecting us to the\r\n     payment of taxes imposed without our consent.\" Strong language\r\n     this, as strong as any we women have ever employed in addressing\r\n     the men of this nation. Our ancestors called the imposition of\r\n     taxes without their consent, slavery, and the denial of personal\r\n     representation, tyranny. Slavery and tyranny! words which they\r\n     tell us to-day are too strong for our use. We must find some mild\r\n     and lady-like phrases in which to describe these oppressions. We\r\n     must employ some safe and gentle terms to indicate the crimes\r\n     which our forefathers denounced! My friends, what was truth a\r\n     century ago is truth to-day! Other things may have changed, but\r\n     justice has not changed in a hundred years!\r\n\r\nIn 1876 a presidential election was again approaching, and to meet\r\nthe exigencies of the campaign a woman suffrage committee was\r\nformed to ask the legislature to grant presidential suffrage to\r\nwomen, as it was strictly within their power to do without a\r\nconstitutional amendment. To this end Mrs. Gage prepared an appeal\r\nwhich was widely circulated throughout the State:\r\n\r\n     Within a year the election of President and Vice-President of the\r\n     United States, will again take place. The right to vote for these\r\n     functionaries is a National and not a State right; the United\r\n     States has unquestioned control of this branch of suffrage, and\r\n     in its constitution has declared to whom it has delegated this\r\n     power. Article 2 of the Constitution of the United States, is\r\n     devoted to the president; the manner of choosing him, his power,\r\n     his duties, etc. In regard to the method of choosing the\r\n     president, Par. 2, Sec. 1, Art. 2, reads thus: \"Each State shall\r\n     appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a\r\n     number of electors, equal to the whole number of senators and\r\n     representatives to which the State may be entitled in the\r\n     congress.\" There is no other authority for the appointment of\r\n     presidential electors, either in the Constitution of the United\r\n     States, or in the constitution of any State. The constitution of\r\n     the State of New York is entirely silent upon the appointment of\r\n     presidential electors, for the reason that the constitution of\r\n     the United States declares that they _shall_ be appointed in such\r\n     manner as the legislature may direct. With the exception of South\r\n     Carolina, every State in the Union has adopted the plan of\r\n     choosing presidential electors by ballot, and it is in the power\r\n     of the legislature of each State to prescribe the qualifications\r\n     of those who shall be permitted to vote for such electors.\r\n\r\n     The authority to prescribe the qualifications of those persons in\r\n     the State of New York who shall be permitted to vote for electors\r\n     of President and Vice-President of the United States, therefore\r\n     lies alone in the legislature of this State. That body has power\r\n     in this respect superior to the State constitution; it rises\r\n     above the constitution; it is invested with its powers by the\r\n     Constitution of the United States; it is under national\r\n     authority, and need in no way be governed by any representative\r\n     clause which may exist in the State constitution. In prescribing\r\n     the qualifications of those persons who shall vote for electors,\r\n     the legislature has power to exclude all persons who cannot read\r\n     and write. It has power to say that no person unless possessing a\r\n     freehold estate of the value of two hundred and fifty dollars,\r\n     shall vote for such electors. It has power to declare that only\r\n     tax-payers shall vote for such electors, it is even vested with\r\n     authority to say that no one but church members shall be entitled\r\n     to vote for electors of President and Vice-President of the\r\n     United States. The legislature of this State at its next session\r\n     has even power to cut off the right of all white men to vote for\r\n     electors at the presidential election next fall. It matters not\r\n     what qualifications the State itself may have prescribed for\r\n     electors of State officers, the question who shall vote for\r\n     president and vice-president is on an entirely different basis,\r\n     and prescribing the qualifications for such electors lies in\r\n     entirely different hands. It is a question of national import\r\n     with which the State (in its constitution) has nothing to do, and\r\n     over which even congress has no power. The legislature which is\r\n     to assemble in Albany, the first Tuesday in January next, will\r\n     have power, by the passage of a simple bill, to secure to the\r\n     women of this State the right to vote for electors at the\r\n     presidential election in the fall of 1876, and thus to inaugurate\r\n     the centennial year by an act of equity and justice that will be\r\n     in accordance with that part of the Declaration of Independence\r\n     which declares that \"governments derive their _just_ powers from\r\n     the consent of the governed.\" Shall it not be done?\r\n\r\n                                   MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE,\r\n                                   LILLIE DEVEREUX BLAKE,\r\n                                   CLEMENCE S. LOZIER, M. D.,\r\n                                       _N. Y. State Woman Suffrage Com._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lillie Devereux Blake]\r\n\r\n\r\nA memorial embodying this claim was presented to the legislature,\r\nand on, January 18, the committee went to Albany and were heard by\r\nthe Judiciary Committee of the Assembly, to whom their paper had\r\nbeen referred. Hon. Robert H. Strahan of New York presided. On\r\nFebruary 8, the memorialists[229] had another meeting before the\r\nJudiciary Committee of the Senate, in the Senate chamber, Hon.\r\nBradford L. Prince presiding. The audience was overflowing, and the\r\ncorridors so crowded that the meeting adjourned to the Assembly\r\nchamber by order of the chairman. Soon after, Hon. George H. West\r\nof Saratoga presented a bill giving the women of the State the\r\nright to vote for president. It was referred to the Judiciary\r\nCommittee and reported adversely, notwithstanding it was twice\r\ncalled up and debated by its friends, Messrs. Strahan, Husted,\r\nOgden, Hogeboom and West. No vote was reached on the measure, but\r\nthis much of consideration was a gain over previous years, when\r\nnothing had been done beyond the presentation of a bill and its\r\nreference to a committee.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 Governor Samuel J. Tilden appointed Mrs. Josephine Shaw\r\nLowell as commissioner of the State Board of Charities, the first\r\nofficial position a woman ever held in this State.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1877 a memorial was sent to the legislature,\r\nasking that women be allowed to serve as school officers. The Hon.\r\nWilliam N. Emerson, senator from Monroe, presented the following\r\nbill:\r\n\r\n     AN ACT _to Authorize the Election of Women to School Offices._\r\n\r\n     The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and\r\n     Assembly, do enact as follows:\r\n\r\n     SECTION 1. Any woman of the age of twenty-one years and upwards,\r\n     and possessing the qualifications prescribed for men, shall be\r\n     eligible to any office under the general or special school laws\r\n     of this State, subject to the same conditions and requirements as\r\n     prescribed to men.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 2. This act shall take effect immediately.\r\n\r\nPetitions and memorials from all parts of the State were poured\r\ninto the legislature, praying for the passage of the bill. Mr.\r\nEmerson made an eloquent speech in its favor, and labored earnestly\r\nfor the measure. It passed the Senate by a vote of 19 to 9; the\r\nAssembly by a vote of 84 to 19. This success was hailed with great\r\nrejoicing by the women of the State who understood the progress of\r\nevents. But their delight was turned into indignation and\r\ndisappointment when the governor, Lucius Robinson, returned the\r\nbill to the Senate with the following veto:\r\n\r\n                              STATE OF NEW YORK, EXECUTIVE CHAMBER, }\r\n                                               ALBANY, May 8, 1877. }\r\n\r\n     _To the Senate:_\r\n\r\n     I return without approval Senate bill No. 61, entitled \"An act to\r\n     authorize the election of women to school offices.\"\r\n\r\n     This bill goes too far or not far enough. It provides that women\r\n     may hold any or all of the offices connected with the department\r\n     of education, that is to say, a woman may be elected\r\n     superintendent of public instruction, women may be appointed\r\n     school commissioners, members of boards of education and trustees\r\n     of school districts. In some of these positions it will become\r\n     their duty to make contracts, purchase materials, build and\r\n     repair school-houses, and to supervise and effect all the\r\n     transactions of school business, involving an annual expenditure\r\n     of over twelve million dollars in this State. There can be no\r\n     greater reason that women should occupy these positions than the\r\n     less responsible ones of supervisors, town clerks, justices of\r\n     the peace, commissioners of highways, overseers of the poor, and\r\n     numerous others. If women are physically and mentally fitted for\r\n     one class of these stations, they are equally so for the others.\r\n\r\n     But at this period in the history of the world such enactments as\r\n     the present hardly comport with the wisdom and dignity of\r\n     legislation. The God of nature has appointed different fields of\r\n     labor, duty and usefulness for the sexes. His decrees cannot be\r\n     changed by human legislation. In the education of our children\r\n     the mother stands far above all superintendents, commissioners,\r\n     trustees and school teachers. Her influence in the family, in\r\n     social intercourse and enterprises, outweighs all the mere\r\n     machinery of benevolence and education. To lower her from the\r\n     high and holy place given her by nature, is to degrade her power\r\n     and to injure rather than benefit the cause of education itself.\r\n     In all enlightened and Christian nations the experience and\r\n     observations of ages have illustrated and defined the relative\r\n     duties of the sexes in promoting the best interests of society.\r\n     Few, if any, of the intelligent and right-minded among women\r\n     desire or would be willing to accept the change which such a law\r\n     would inaugurate.\r\n\r\n     The bill is moreover a clear infraction of the spirit if not the\r\n     letter of the constitution. Under that instrument women have no\r\n     right to vote, and it cannot be supposed that it is the intention\r\n     of the constitution that persons not entitled to the right of\r\n     suffrage should be eligible to some of the most important offices\r\n     in the State.\r\n\r\n                                             L. ROBINSON.\r\n\r\nOn May 24, 25, 1877, the National and State conventions were again\r\nheld in New York, at Steinway Hall. Both conventions passed\r\nresolutions denouncing Governor Robinson's action in his veto. The\r\nfollowing address was issued by the State association:\r\n\r\n     _To the Voters and Legislators of New York:_\r\n\r\n     The women of the State of New York, in convention assembled, do\r\n     most earnestly protest against the injustice with which they are\r\n     treated by the State, where in point of numbers they are in\r\n     excess of the men:\r\n\r\n          _First_--They are denied the right of choosing their own\r\n          rulers, but are compelled to submit to the choice of a\r\n          minority consisting of its male residents, fully one-third\r\n          of whom are of foreign birth. _Second_--They are held\r\n          amenable to laws they have had no share in making and in\r\n          which they are forbidden a voice--laws which touch all their\r\n          most vital interests of education, industry, children,\r\n          property, life and liberty. _Third_--While compelled to bear\r\n          the burdens and suffer the penalties of government, they are\r\n          debarred the honors and emoluments of civil service, and the\r\n          control of offices in the righteous discharge of whose\r\n          duties their interest is equal to that of men.\r\n          _Fourth_--They are taxed without their consent to sustain\r\n          men in office who enact laws directly opposing their\r\n          interests, and inasmuch as the State of New York pays\r\n          one-sixth the taxes of the United States, its women feel the\r\n          arm of oppression--like Briareus with his hundred\r\n          hands--touching and crushing them with its burdens.\r\n          _Fifth_--They are under the power of an autocrat whose\r\n          salary they must pay, but who, in opposition to the will of\r\n          the people--as recently shown in the passage of the School\r\n          bill by the legislature--has by his veto denied them all\r\n          official authority in the control of the public schools, and\r\n          this despite the fact of there being 3,670 more girls of\r\n          school age than boys, and 14,819 more women than men\r\n          teaching in the State. _Sixth_--Under pretence of regulating\r\n          public morals, women of the _femme de pave_ class, many of\r\n          whom have been driven to this mode of life as a livelihood,\r\n          are subjected to more oppressive laws than their partners in\r\n          vice. _Seventh_--The laws treat married women as criminals\r\n          by taking from them all legal control of their children,\r\n          while those born outside of marriage belong absolutely to\r\n          the mothers. _Eighth_--They forbid the mother's inheritance\r\n          of property from her children in case the father is living,\r\n          thus making her of no consideration in the eyes of those to\r\n          whom she has given birth. _Ninth_--They give the husband\r\n          control of the common property--allow him to spend the whole\r\n          personal estate in riotous living, or even to sell the home\r\n          over his wife's head, subject only to her third\r\n          life-interest in case she survives him. _Tenth_--They allow\r\n          the husband to imprison her at his pleasure within his own\r\n          house, the court sustaining him in this coercion until the\r\n          wife \"submits herself to her husband's will.\"\r\n          _Eleventh_--They allow the husband while the common property\r\n          is in his possession, \"without even the formality of a legal\r\n          complaint, the taking of an oath or the filing of a bond for\r\n          the good faith of his action,\" to advertise his wife through\r\n          the public press as a deserter and to forbid her credit.\r\n          _Twelfth_--They deny the widow the right of inheritance in\r\n          the common property that they give the widower, allow her\r\n          but forty days' residence in the family mansion before\r\n          paying rent to her husband's heirs, thus treating her as if\r\n          she were an alien to her own children--set off to her a few\r\n          paltry articles of household use, close the estate through a\r\n          process of law, and make the days of her bereavement doubly\r\n          days of sorrow.\r\n\r\n     The above laws of marriage, placing irresponsible authority in\r\n     the hands of the husband, have given him a power of moral\r\n     coercion over the wife, making her virtually his slave. Without\r\n     entering into fuller details of the injustice and oppression of\r\n     the laws upon all women, married and single, we will sum the\r\n     whole subject up in the language of the French Woman's Rights\r\n     League, which characterizes woman's position thus:\r\n\r\n          (1) Woman is held _politically_ to have no existence; (2)\r\n          _civilly_, she is a minor; (3) in marriage she is a serf;\r\n          (4) in labor she is made inferior and robbed of her\r\n          earnings; (5) in public instruction she is sacrificed to\r\n          man; (6) out of marriage, answers to the faults committed by\r\n          both; (7) as a mother is deprived of her right to her\r\n          children; (8) she is only deemed equally responsible,\r\n          intelligent and answerable in taxes and crimes.\r\n\r\n     By order of the New York State Woman Suffrage Society.\r\n\r\n     May, 1877.            MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1877 another effort was made by women of wealth to\r\nbe relieved from taxation. Several memorials to that effect were\r\nsent to the legislature, one headed by Susan A. King[230] of New\r\nYork, a self-made woman who had accumulated a large fortune and\r\nowned much real estate. Her memorial, signed by a few others,\r\nrepresented $9,000,000. The committee bearing these waited on many\r\nmembers of the legislature to secure their influence when such a\r\nbill should be presented, which was done March 11, by Col. Alfred\r\nWagstaff, with warm recommendations. He was followed by Senator\r\nMcCarthy of Onondaga, who also introduced a bill for an amendment\r\nto the constitution to secure to women the right of suffrage. Both\r\nthese bills called out the determined opposition of Thomas C.\r\nEcclesine, senator from the eleventh district, and the ridicule of\r\nothers. The delegation of ladies, sitting there as representatives\r\nof half the people of the State, felt insulted to have their\r\ndemands thus sneered at; it was for them a moment of bitter\r\nhumiliation. In the evening, however, their time for retaliation\r\ncame, as they had a hearing in the Senate chamber, before the\r\nJudiciary Committee, where an immense crowd assembled at an early\r\nhour. The chairman of the committee Hon. William H. Robertson,\r\npresided. Each of the ladies, in the course of her speech, referred\r\nto the insulting remarks of Mr. Hughes of Washington county. That\r\ngentleman, being present, looked as if he regretted his unfortunate\r\njokes, and winced under the sarcasm of the ladies.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, great excitement was created by the close of\r\nStewart's Home for Working Women. This fine building, on the corner\r\nof Thirty-second street and Fourth avenue, had been erected by the\r\nmerchant prince for the use of working women, who could there find\r\na home at a moderate expense. The millionaire dead, his large\r\nfortune passed into other hands. The building was completed and\r\nfurnished in a style of elegance far beyond what was appropriated\r\nto that purpose. On April 2, with a great flourish, the immense\r\nbuilding was thrown open for public inspection. A large number of\r\nwomen applied at once for admission, but encountered a set of rules\r\nthat drove most of them away. This gave Judge Hilton an excuse for\r\nviolating his obligation to carry out the plan of his dead\r\nbenefactor, and in a few weeks he closed the house to working women\r\nand opened it as the Park Hotel, for which it was so admirably\r\nfurnished and fitted that it was the general opinion that it was\r\nintended for this from the beginning. Great indignation was felt in\r\nthe community, the women calling a meeting to express their\r\ndisappointment and dissatisfaction. This was held in Cooper\r\nInstitute, under the auspices of the Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation.[231] Had Mr. Stewart provided a permanent home for\r\nworking women it would have been but a meager return for the\r\nunderpaid toil of the thousands who had labored for half a century\r\nto build up his princely fortune. But even the idea of such an act\r\nof justice died with him.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 that eminent philanthropist Dr. Hervey Backus Wilbur,\r\nsuperintendent of the State Idiot Asylum at Syracuse, urged the\r\npassage of a law requiring the employment of competent women as\r\nphysicians in the female wards of the State insane asylums.\r\nPetitions prepared by him were circulated by the officers of the\r\nWomen's Medical College, of the New York Infirmary, by Mrs.\r\nJosephine Shaw Lowell of the State Board of Charities, and by Drs.\r\nWillard Parker, Mary Putnam Jacobi, and other eminent physicians of\r\nNew York. The bill prepared by Dr. Wilbur was introduced in the\r\nAssembly by Hon. Erastus Brooks, and required the trustees of each\r\nof the four State asylums for the insane, \"to employ one or more\r\ncompetent, well-educated female physicians to have the charge of\r\nthe female patients of said asylum, under the direction of the\r\nmedical superintendents of the several asylums, as in the case of\r\nthe other or male assistant physicians, and to take the place of\r\nsuch male assistant physician or physicians in the wards of the\r\nfemale patients.\" Although Dr. Wilbur stood at the head of his\r\nprofession, his authority upon everything connected with the\r\nfeeble-minded being not only recognized in this country but in\r\nEurope also as absolute, yet this bill, which did not contemplate\r\nplacing a woman in charge of such an institution, and which was so\r\npurely moral in its character, met with ridicule and opposition\r\nfrom the press of the State, to which Dr. Wilbur made an exhaustive\r\nreply, showing the need of women as physicians in all institutions\r\nin which unfortunate women are incarcerated.\r\n\r\nWhen the fall elections of 1879 approached, a circular letter was\r\nsent to every candidate for office in the city, asking his views on\r\nthe question of woman suffrage, and delegations waited on the\r\nnominees for mayor. Mr. Edward Cooper, the Republican candidate,\r\ndeclared he had no sympathy with the movement, while Hon. Augustus\r\nSchell, the Democratic candidate, received the ladies with great\r\ncourtesy, and avowed himself friendly at least to the demand for\r\nequal wages and better opportunities for education, and in the\r\ntrades and professions. From the answers received, a list of\r\ncandidates was prepared. On the evening of October 30, a crowded\r\nmass-meeting was held in Steinway Hall to advocate the election of\r\nthose men who were favorable to the enfranchisement of woman. Mr.\r\nSchell was chosen Mayor. The re-nomination in 1879, of Lucius\r\nRobinson for governor by the Democratic convention, aroused the\r\nopposition of the women who understood the politics of the State.\r\nHe had declared that \"the God of Nature did not intend women for\r\npublic life\"; they resolved that the same power should retire Mr.\r\nRobinson from public life, and held mass-meetings to that end.[232]\r\nThese meetings were all alike crowded and enthusiastic, and the\r\nspeakers[233] felt richly paid for their efforts. A thorough\r\ncanvass of the State was also made, and a protest[234] extensively\r\ncirculated, condemning the governor for his veto of the\r\nschool-bill.\r\n\r\nMr. F. B. Thurber, and Miss Susan A. King contributed liberally to\r\nthis campaign. Handbills containing the protest and a call for a\r\nseries of mass-meetings, were distributed by the thousands all over\r\nthe State. The last meeting was held at the seventh ward Republican\r\nwigwam, an immense structure, in Brooklyn: its use was given by the\r\nunanimous vote of the club.[235] At every one of these meetings\r\nresolutions were passed condemning Mr. Robinson, and electors were\r\nurged to cast their votes against him. No doubt the enthusiasm the\r\nwomen aroused for his opponent helped in a measure to defeat him.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, women in the eleventh senatorial district were\r\nconcentrating their efforts for the defeat of Thomas H. Eccelsine.\r\nHis Republican opponent, Hon. Chas. E. Foster, was a pronounced\r\nadvocate of woman suffrage. Miss King,[236] who resided in this\r\ndistrict, exerted all her influence for his election, giving time,\r\nmoney and thought to the canvass. On the morning of November 5, the\r\nday after election, the papers announced that Mr. Cornell was\r\nchosen governor, and that Mr. Ecclesine, who two years before had\r\nbeen elected by 7,000 majority, was defeated by 600, and Mr. Foster\r\nchosen senator in his stead.\r\n\r\nThis campaign attracted much attention. The journals throughout the\r\ncountry commented upon the action of the women. It was conceded\r\nthat their efforts had counted for something in influencing the\r\nelection, and from this moment the leaders of the woman suffrage\r\nmovement in New York regarded themselves as possessing some\r\npolitical influence.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1880, Governor Alonzo B. Cornell, in his first message\r\nto the legislature, among other recommendations, embodied the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     The policy of making women eligible as school officers has been\r\n     adopted in several States with beneficial results, and the\r\n     question is exciting much discussion in this State. Women are\r\n     equally competent with men for this duty, and it cannot be\r\n     doubted that their admission to representation would largely\r\n     increase the efficacy of our school management. The favorable\r\n     attention of the legislature is earnestly directed to this\r\n     subject.\r\n\r\nWith such words from the chief executive it was an easy matter to\r\nfind friends for a measure making women eligible as school\r\nofficers. Early in the session the following bill was introduced by\r\nHon. Lorraine B. Sessions of Cattaraugus:\r\n\r\n     No person shall be deemed ineligible to serve as any school\r\n     officer, or to vote at any school meeting, by reason of sex, who\r\n     has the voter's qualifications required by law.\r\n\r\nSenator Edwin G. Halbert of Broome rendered efficient aid and the\r\nbill passed at once in the Senate by a nearly unanimous vote. Hon.\r\nG. W. Husted of Westchester introduced it at once in the assembly\r\nand earnestly championed the measure. It passed by a vote of 87 to\r\n3. The bill was laid before the governor, who promptly affixed his\r\nsignature to it, and thus, at last, secured to the women of the\r\nEmpire State the right to vote on all school matters, and to hold\r\nany school offices to which they might be chosen. The bill was\r\nsigned on February 12, and the next day being Friday, was the last\r\nday of registration in the city of Syracuse, the election there\r\ntaking place on the following Tuesday. The news did not reach there\r\nuntil late in the day, the evening papers being the first to\r\ncontain it. But, although so little was known of the measure,\r\nthirteen women registered their names as voters, and cast their\r\nballots at the election. This was the first time the women of New\r\nYork ever voted, and Tuesday, February 18, 1880, is a day to be\r\nremembered.[237] The voting for officers, like all other-school\r\nmatters, was provided for, not under the general laws, but by the\r\nschool statutes. There are two general elections in chartered\r\ncities and universal suffrage for school as well as all other\r\nofficers; no preparation being required of voters but registration.\r\nIn the rural districts school meetings are held for elections, and\r\nthere are, by the statutes, three classes of voters described by\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n     1. Every person (male or female) who is a resident of the\r\n     district, of the age of twenty-one years, entitled to hold lands\r\n     in this State, who either owns or hires real estate in the\r\n     district liable to taxation for school purposes.\r\n\r\n     2. Every citizen of the United States (male or female) above the\r\n     age of twenty-one years, who is a resident of the district, and\r\n     who owns any personal property assessed on the last preceding\r\n     assessment roll of the town exceeding $50 in value, exclusive of\r\n     such as is exempt from execution.\r\n\r\n     3. Every citizen of the United States (male or female) above the\r\n     age of twenty-one years, who is a resident of the district and\r\n     who has permanently residing with him, or her, a child or\r\n     children of school age, some one or more of whom shall have\r\n     attended the school of the district for a period of at least\r\n     eight weeks within the year preceding the time at which the vote\r\n     is offered.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the large cities hold their elections on the first\r\nTuesday in March, while the majority of the rural districts hold\r\ntheir school meetings on the second Tuesday in October.\r\nPreparations were at once made to call out a large vote of women in\r\nthe cities holding spring elections, but all such efforts were\r\nchecked by official action. The mayor of Rochester wrote to the\r\ngovernor, asking him if the new law applied to cities. Mr. Cornell\r\nlaid the question before Attorney-General Ward, who promptly gave\r\nan opinion that inasmuch as the words \"school meeting\" were used in\r\nthe law, women could only vote where such meetings were held, but\r\nwere not entitled to vote at the elections in large cities.\r\nMeantime the New York City Association called a meeting of\r\ncongratulation on the passage of the bill on February 25, when\r\nRobinson Hall was crowded to overflowing with the friends of woman\r\nsuffrage, some of whom addressed the vast audience.[238]\r\n\r\nA mass-meeting of women was held at Albany, in Geological Hall,\r\nMrs. Blake presiding. It was especially announced that the meeting\r\nwas only for ladies, but several men who strayed in were permitted\r\nto remain, to take that part in the proceedings usually allowed to\r\nwomen in masculine assemblies, that is, to be silent spectators.\r\nResolutions were passed, urging the women to vote at the coming\r\nelection, and the names of several ladies were suggested as\r\ntrustees. March 19, 1880, the Albany County Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation[239] was formed, whose first active duty was to rouse\r\nthe women to vote in the coming school election, which they did, in\r\nspite of the attorney-general's opinion.\r\n\r\nMr. Edwin G. Halbert of Broome also introduced a bill in the\r\nSenate, for a constitutional amendment, to secure to women the\r\nright of suffrage, which was passed by that conservative body just\r\nbefore its adjournment. Meantime Mr. Wilcox urged the passage of\r\nthe bill to prohibit disfranchisement, which was brought to a third\r\nreading in the Assembly. He prepared and circulated among the\r\nmembers of the legislature a brief,[240] showing their power to\r\nextend the suffrage. The argument is unanswerable, establishing the\r\nfact that women had voted through the early days of the Colonies,\r\nand proving, by unanswerable authorities, their right to do so;\r\nthus establishing the right of women to vote in 1885. Mr.\r\nWilcox' researches on this point will prove invaluable in the\r\nenfranchisement of woman, as his facts are irresistible. Following\r\nis the proposed bill:\r\n\r\n     AN ACT _to Prohibit Disfranchisement_.\r\n\r\n     Introduced in the Assembly by Hon. Alex. F. Andrews, March 31,\r\n     1880. Reported by the Judiciary Committee for consideration, May\r\n     24. Ordered to third reading, May 27. Again so reported,\r\n     unanimously, March 16, 1881. Again ordered to third reading, May\r\n     3, 1881; ayes 60, noes 40. Vote on passage, May 11, 1881; ayes\r\n     59, noes 55, majority 4. (65 necessary to pass).\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_, the common law entitles women to vote under the same\r\n     qualifications as men; and\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_, said common law has never been abrogated in this\r\n     State; and\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_, a practice nevertheless obtains of treating as\r\n     disfranchised all persons to whom suffrage is not secured by\r\n     express words of the constitution; and\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_, the constitution makes no provision for this practice,\r\n     but on the contrary declares that its own object is to secure the\r\n     blessings of freedom to the people, and provides that no member\r\n     of this State shall be disfranchised or deprived of any of the\r\n     privileges secured to any citizen unless by constitutional\r\n     provision and judicial decision thereunder; and\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_, this practice, despite the want of authority therefor,\r\n     has by continuance acquired the force of law; and\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_, many citizens object to this practice as a violation\r\n     of the spirit and purpose of the constitution, as well as against\r\n     justice and public policy; and\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_, the legislature has corrected this practice in\r\n     repeated instances, its power to do so being in such instances\r\n     fully recognized and exercised; therefore\r\n\r\n     The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and\r\n     Assembly, do enact as follows:\r\n\r\n     SECTION 1. Every woman shall be free to vote, under the\r\n     qualifications required of men, or to refrain from voting, as she\r\n     may choose; and no person shall be debarred, by reason of sex,\r\n     from voting at any election, or at any town meeting, school\r\n     meeting, or other choice of government functionaries whatsoever.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 2. All acts and parts of acts inconsistent with this act,\r\n     are hereby repealed.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 3. This act shall take effect immediately.\r\n\r\nVarious memorials were sent to the legislature in behalf of this\r\nbill, and a hearing was granted to its advocates.[241] The\r\nAssembly chamber in the beautiful new capitol was crowded as it\r\nhad never been before. A large proportion of the senators and\r\nassemblymen were present, many of the judges from the various\r\ncourts, while the governor and lieutenant-governor occupied\r\nprominent places, and large crowds of fashionable ladies and\r\nleading gentlemen filled the seats and galleries. The chairman of\r\nthe committee, Hon. George L. Ferry, presided. The ladies were\r\ngraciously received by the governor, who, at their request, gave\r\nthem the pen with which he signed the bill providing \"school\r\nsuffrage for women,\" and in return they presented him a handsome\r\ngold-mounted pen, a gift from the City Society.\r\n\r\nThe first voting by women after the passage of the new law, was at\r\nSyracuse, February 17, only five days after the bill received the\r\ngovernor's signature, but the great body of women had not the\r\nopportunity until October. At that time in Fayetteville, the home\r\nof Matilda Joslyn Gage, women voted in large numbers; the three who\r\nhad been placed upon the ticket, trustee, clerk and librarian were\r\nall elected. It was an hour of triumph for Mrs. Gage who was\r\nheartily congratulated upon the result. It was remarked that so\r\nquiet an election had seldom been known. At Middletown, Orange\r\ncounty, Dr. Lydia Sayre Hasbrook urged the women to take advantage\r\nof their new privilege, and when the day of election came, although\r\nit was cold and stormy, over 200 voted, and elected the entire\r\nticket of women for trustees, Mrs. Hasbrook herself being chosen as\r\none.\r\n\r\nThere were many places, however, where no women voted, for the\r\nreform had all the antagonisms and prejudices of custom to\r\novercome. Many obstacles were thrown in the way to prevent them\r\nfrom exercising this right. The men of their families objecting,\r\nand misconstruing the law, kept them in doubt both as to their\r\nrights and duties. The clergy from their pulpits warned the women\r\nof their congregations not to vote, fathers forbade their\r\ndaughters, husbands their wives. The wonder is that against such a\r\npressure so many women did vote after all.\r\n\r\nOctober 12, 1880, the elections took place in a large proportion of\r\nthe eleven thousand school districts of the State, and the daily\r\njournals were full of items as to the result. We copy a few of\r\nthese:\r\n\r\n     LOWVILLE, Lewis County, Oct. 16, 1880.--The business meeting was\r\n     held on the evening of the 12th, and was attended by twenty\r\n     ladies. On the following day at 1 P.M., the election was held.\r\n     The ladies had an independent ticket opposing the incumbent clerk\r\n     and trustee. Seven voted. Four were challenged. They swore their\r\n     votes in. Boys just turned twenty-one years of age voted\r\n     unchallenged. The clerk, who is a young sprig of a lawyer, made\r\n     himself conspicuous by challenging our votes. He first read the\r\n     opinion of the State superintendent of public instruction, and\r\n     said that the penalty for illegal voting was not less than six\r\n     months' imprisonment. My vote was challenged, and although my\r\n     husband is an owner of much real estate and cannot sell one foot\r\n     of it without my consent, I could not vote.\r\n\r\n     From Penn Yan a woman writes:--About seventy ladies voted here,\r\n     but none who did not either own or lease real estate. The\r\n     argument so often used against woman suffrage--viz: that the\r\n     first to avail themselves of the privilege would be those least\r\n     qualified to do so, is directly refuted, in this town at least,\r\n     since the ladies who voted are without doubt those who by natural\r\n     ability and by culture are abundantly competent to vote\r\n     intelligently as well as conscientiously.\r\n\r\n     A woman in Nunda writes:--Only six women attended the school\r\n     meeting in the first district on the 12th, but over forty went to\r\n     the polls on the 13th. Two women were on one of the tickets; the\r\n     opposition ticket was made up entirely of males. We were\r\n     supported by the best men in the village. The ticket bearing the\r\n     names of Mrs. Fidelia J. M. Whitcomb, M. D., and Mrs. S. Augusta\r\n     Herrick, was elected.\r\n\r\n     From Poland a woman writes:--Our school meeting was attended by\r\n     about thirty men and two women. The population of the village is\r\n     between three and four hundred. My neighbor and I were proud of\r\n     the privilege of casting our first vote. There was nothing of\r\n     special interest to call out voters, as our trustees are\r\n     satisfactory to all. If circumstances required, there would be\r\n     many women voters here.\r\n\r\n     David Hopkins and Gustave Dettloff were candidates for school\r\n     trustee in district No. 1 of New Lots, Long Island, at the last\r\n     election. Mr. Hopkins is a farmer and was seeking reelection. Mr.\r\n     Dettloff is connected with an insurance company in this city, and\r\n     is a well-known resident of the town. The friends of Mr. Hopkins\r\n     about an hour before the closing of the polls, perceived that\r\n     there was danger of their candidate's defeat. A consultation was\r\n     held, and it was decided to utilize the new law giving women the\r\n     privilege of voting. Accordingly, several farm wagons were\r\n     procured and sent through the district to gather in the farmers'\r\n     wives and daughters. The wagons returned to the polls with 107\r\n     women, all of whom voted for Mr. Hopkins, thus saving him from\r\n     defeat. It was too late to use a counter poison. The total number\r\n     of votes cast was 329, Mr. Hopkins receiving eighty majority.\r\n\r\n     PORT JERVIS. Oct. 13.--The annual election of school trustees\r\n     occurred to-day and was attended with unusual excitement. Eight\r\n     hundred and thirty votes were polled, 150, for the women's\r\n     ticket, the remainder being divided. Only fifty ladies voted, a\r\n     great many being kept from the polls by the crowd of loafers\r\n     standing around. The Protestant ticket, composed of three men,\r\n     was elected. The election was held in a small room, and this was\r\n     crowded with men who amused themselves by passing remarks about\r\n     the ladies until the police were called in. Every lady who\r\n     offered her vote was challenged and a great many left the polls\r\n     in disgust. In Carpenter's Point and Sparrowbush, two suburbs of\r\n     the village, the ladies voted and were not molested.\r\n\r\n     Only a few women voted on Tuesday evening at the election for\r\n     school trustees in the first district of Southfield, Staten\r\n     Island. When the poll was opened Judge John G. Vaughan, the\r\n     retiring trustee, presided. A motion was made to reelect him by\r\n     acclamation. Amid great confusion Judge Vaughan put the motion\r\n     and declared it carried. Then Officers Fitzgerald and Leary had\r\n     to take charge of the meeting to preserve order, and Judge\r\n     Vaughan's opponents withdrew, threatening proceedings to have the\r\n     election declared invalid. Abram C. Wood was elected school\r\n     trustee in the West New Brighton (S. I.) district by 69 majority,\r\n     which included the votes of eight of eleven women present. Other\r\n     women promised to vote if Mr. Wood needed their support. Mr.\r\n     Robert B. Minturn presided.\r\n\r\n     SING SING, Oct. 13.--Five women voted at the school meeting last\r\n     night.\r\n\r\n     MOUNT MORRIS, Oct. 13.--One hundred and twenty women voted at the\r\n     school election here last evening.\r\n\r\n     GLEN'S FALLS, Oct. 13.--I am informed that women did vote here\r\n     and in the neighborhood last evening.\r\n\r\n     PERRY, Oct. 13.--A large woman vote was cast here. Two women were\r\n     elected members of the school-board.\r\n\r\n     PEEKSKILL, Oct. 13.--Five women voted in one district.\r\n\r\n     SHELTER ISLAND, Oct. 13.--Women voted at our school meeting.\r\n\r\n     COFFIN SUMMIT, Oct. 15.--Six women voted at the school meeting\r\n     here. A lady was nominated for trustee and received many votes,\r\n     but was defeated.\r\n\r\n     STAMFORD, Oct. 15.--Four ladies voted at the school meeting.\r\n\r\n     PORT RICHMOND, Oct. 15.--Six ladies attended the school meeting.\r\n     The chairman, Mr. Sidney P. Ronason, made a speech, welcoming\r\n     them, stating that an unsuccessful effort had been made by\r\n     citizens to induce a leading lady to become a candidate for\r\n     trustee; also, that Lester A. Scofield, the retiring trustee,\r\n     would cheerfully give way if any competent lady would take his\r\n     place. This Mr. Scofield confirmed, but, no lady being nominated,\r\n     he was reelected without opposition.\r\n\r\n     BALDWINVILLE, Oct. 15.--Thirty-three ladies voted at the school\r\n     election.\r\n\r\n     LOCKPORT, Oct. 15.--Two Quaker ladies voted at the school meeting\r\n     of the first district of this township. One of them, Dr. Sarah\r\n     Lamb Cushing, was chosen tax-collector by 23 votes out of 26. On\r\n     the entrance of the ladies, smoking and all disorder ceased, and\r\n     the meeting was uncommonly well-conducted.\r\n\r\n     LAWTON STATION, Oct. 15.--Of the 16 votes cast at the school\r\n     meeting here, 15 were given by women. A woman received the\r\n     highest vote for school trustee, but withdrew in favor of one of\r\n     the male candidates. The proceedings were enlivened with singing\r\n     by the pupils under the direction of the teacher. Several\r\n     improvements in the building were ordered at the instance of the\r\n     ladies.\r\n\r\n     KNOWLESVILLE, Oct. 15.--Many women meant to vote at the school\r\n     meeting, but a person went from house to house and threatened\r\n     them with legal penalties if they did. Mrs. James Kernholtz was\r\n     nominated for tax-collector at the meeting, but declined, saying\r\n     the pay was too small. Miss Adelina Lockwood, being nominated for\r\n     librarian, declined, but was elected by acclamation, amid great\r\n     applause. The meeting was very large, but unusually orderly.\r\n\r\n     FLUSHING, Oct. 15.--Forty women voted at the school meeting here,\r\n     and in the adjoining district.\r\n\r\n     SYRACUSE, Oct. 14, 1881.--At the Fayetteville, Onondaga county,\r\n     school district election yesterday, a direct issue was made on\r\n     the question of woman's rights. The candidate of the women was\r\n     chosen. This is the women's second victory in that place, giving\r\n     them control of the school-board.\r\n\r\nA correspondent describing what the voters had to encounter, said:\r\n\r\n     Is the question asked, why have not more women voted? I answer,\r\n     hundreds of women in this State were debarred by falsehood and\r\n     intimidation. No sooner had the school suffrage law passed than\r\n     the wildest statements about it were made. It was given out that\r\n     the Governor had recalled the bill from the Secretary of State\r\n     after signing it (which he could not do), and vetoed it; that the\r\n     law was unconstitutional; that it was defective and inoperative;\r\n     that it did not apply to cities and villages; that it had been\r\n     repealed; and like untruths. Pains was taken to hide its\r\n     existence by corrupt officials, who told the women that the law\r\n     did not apply to the places where they lived, or who withheld the\r\n     fact of its passage. The State was flooded just before the\r\n     elections with an incorrect statement that only the rich women\r\n     could vote; that the children's mothers could not unless they\r\n     held real estate. The story was also set afloat that the\r\n     attorney-general had indorsed this statement; which that\r\n     gentleman promptly repudiated. All this we corrected as fast and\r\n     as far as we could; but it unavoidably did much harm.\r\n\r\n     Wholesale hindrance and terrorism too, were used. A few samples\r\n     are these: In Albany, many women were threatened by their own\r\n     husbands with expulsion from house and home, imprisonment, bodily\r\n     violence or death if they dared vote; while many others were\r\n     deterred by insults and threats of social persecution. Many\r\n     persons ridiculed and abused those who sought to vote. In some\r\n     districts the inspectors refused to register qualified women,\r\n     while in others votes were refused. Statements were widely\r\n     published that the law did not apply to Albany. In Knowersville,\r\n     the village teacher went to every house, and threatened the women\r\n     with state-prison if they dared to vote. In Mount Morris, the\r\n     president of the Board of Education denounced the ladies who\r\n     induced others to vote. In Fayetteville, Saratoga and elsewhere,\r\n     the ladies' request for some share in making the tickets was\r\n     scornfully ignored. In Port Jervis, the Board of Education\r\n     declined a hall that was offered, and had the election in a low,\r\n     dirty little room. Smoke was puffed in the ladies' faces,\r\n     challenges were frequent, and all sorts of impudent questions\r\n     were asked of the voters. In Long Island City many ladies were\r\n     challenged, and stones were thrown in the street at Mrs. Emma\r\n     Gates Conkling, the lady who was most active in bringing out the\r\n     new voters. In New Brighton, the village paper threatened the\r\n     women with jail if they voted; and when a motion was made in one\r\n     district that the ladies be invited to attend, a large negative\r\n     vote was given, one man shouting, \"We have enough of women at\r\n     home; we don't want'em here!\" At West New Brighton it was openly\r\n     announced that the meeting should be too turbulent for ladies,\r\n     insomuch that many who intended to go staid away, and the few who\r\n     went were obliged to wait till all the men had voted. In Newham a\r\n     gang of low fellows took possession of the polling place early,\r\n     filled it with smoke of the worst tobacco, and covered the floor\r\n     with tobacco juice; and through all this the few ladies who\r\n     ventured to vote had to pass. In New York a man who claims to be\r\n     a gentleman said: \"If my wife undertook to vote I would trample\r\n     her under my feet.\" In New Rochelle the school trustee told the\r\n     women they were not entitled to vote, and tried to prevent a\r\n     meeting being held to inform them. Clergymen from the pulpit\r\n     urged women not to vote, and a mob gathered at the polls and\r\n     blocked the way. These are but samples of the difficulties under\r\n     which the new law went into operation; and it is the truth that\r\n     there was as much bulldozing of voters in New York as ever in the\r\n     South, though sometimes by other means.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 Mrs. Blake was sent by the New York society to the\r\nRepublican and Democratic presidential conventions at Chicago and\r\nCincinnati, and on her return a meeting was called in Republican\r\nHall, July 9, to hear her report as to the comparative treatment\r\nreceived by the delegates in the two conventions. Soon afterwards a\r\ndelegation of ladies[242] waited on Winfield S. Hancock, the\r\nDemocratic nominee, who received them with much courtesy, saying he\r\nwas quite willing to interpret, in its broadest sense, that clause\r\nof his letter of acceptance wherein he said: \"It is only by a full\r\nvote and a fair count that the people can rule in fact, as required\r\nby the theory of our government.\" \"I am willing, ladies,\" said the\r\ngeneral, \"to have you say that I believe in a free ballot for all\r\nthe people of the United States, women as well as men.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Blake, Mrs. Slocum and Mr. Wilcox made quite an extensive\r\ncanvass through many counties of the State, to rouse the women to\r\nuse their right to vote on all school matters.\r\n\r\nThe bill to prohibit disfranchisement was again introduced in the\r\nlegislature of 1881, by Joseph M. Congdon, and ordered to a third\r\nreading May 3, by a vote of 60 to 40, and on May 11 came up for\r\nfinal action, when the ladies, by special courtesy, were admitted\r\nto the floor of the Assembly chamber to listen to the discussion.\r\nGeneral Francis B. Spinola and General James W. Husted made earnest\r\nspeeches in favor of the bill, and Hon. Erastus Brooks and General\r\nGeorge A. Sharpe in opposition. The roll-call gave 57 ayes to 55\r\nnoes--a majority of those present, but not the majority (65) of all\r\nthe members of the Assembly, which the constitution of New York\r\nrequires for the final passage of a bill. The vote astonished the\r\nopponents, and placed the measure among the grave questions of the\r\nday. This substantial success inspired the friends to renewed\r\nefforts.[243]\r\n\r\nThe necessity of properly qualified women in the police stations\r\nagain came up for consideration. The condition of unfortunate women\r\nnightly consigned to these places had long been set forth by the\r\nleaders of the suffrage movement. In New York there were thirty-two\r\nstation-houses in which, from night to night, from five to forty\r\nwomen were lodged, some on criminal charges, some from extreme\r\npoverty. All there, young and old, were entirely in the hands of\r\nmen, in sickness or distress. If search was to be made on charge of\r\ntheft, it was always a male official who performed the duty. If the\r\nmost delicate and refined lady were taken ill on the street, or\r\ninjured in any way, she was liable to be taken to the nearest\r\nstation, where the needful examinations to ascertain if life yet\r\nlingered must be made by men. In view of these facts, a resolution\r\nwas again passed at the State convention, and request made to the\r\npolice commissioners, to permit a delegation of ladies to meet with\r\nthem in conference. The commissioners deigned no reply, but gave\r\nthe letter to the press, whereupon ensued a storm of comment and\r\nridicule.\r\n\r\nOn consultation with Mrs. Josephine Shaw Lowell, commissioner of\r\nthe State Board of Charities, a bill was drawn up and sent to\r\nAlbany, providing for the appointment of one or more police-matrons\r\nat every station-house in cities of 50,000 inhabitants and upwards,\r\nthe salaries to be $600 each. Hon. J. C. Boyd presented the bill in\r\nthe Senate, where it passed April 18. In the Assembly its passage\r\nwas urged by Hon. Michael C. Murphy, chairman of the Committee on\r\nCities. Meantime Mayor Grace and Comptroller Campbell entered their\r\nprotest against the bill, declaring the measure ought to originate\r\nin the city departments, where there was full power to appoint\r\npolice-matrons; also, that the proposed salaries would be a heavy\r\ndrain upon the city treasury. The comptroller was at once informed\r\nof the previous application to the police commissioners, from whom\r\nno reply had been received, which virtually compelled appeal to the\r\nlegislature. And as to salaries, it was suggested that there were\r\nnow on the pay-roll of the police of New York 2,500 men whose\r\nsalaries amounted to over $2,500,000, whereas the bill before the\r\nlegislature asked for only sixty matrons, whose salaries would\r\namount to but $36,000. This was certainly a most reasonable demand\r\nfor the protection of one-half the people of the city, who paid\r\nfully half the indirect taxes as well as a fair proportion of the\r\ndirect taxes. Finally, it was proposed to the comptroller that the\r\nbill should be withdrawn if he would recommend the appointment of\r\npolice-matrons in the city departments. This was not accepted. The\r\nCommittee on Cities gave a hearing to Mrs. Blake, and reported\r\nunanimously in favor of the bill. Public sentiment supported the\r\nmeasure, the press generally advocated it, and the Assembly passed\r\nthe bill by a vote of 96 to 7; but it failed to receive the\r\nsignature of the governor,--a most striking proof of the need of\r\nthe ballot for women; since, friendly as he was to woman's\r\nenfranchisement, when he found the police department, with its\r\nthousands of attaches, _all with votes_ in their hands, opposed,\r\nGovernor Cornell was found wanting in courage and conscience to\r\nsign this bill for women who had no votes.[244] The next year\r\napplication was again made to the city authorities for the\r\nappointment of matrons, but they refused to act. The bill was\r\nreintroduced in the legislature, passed by a large majority in the\r\nAssembly, but defeated in the Senate by the adverse report of the\r\nCommittee on Cities. A mass-meeting to discuss this question of\r\npolice-matrons was held in Steinway Hall, March 1, at which the\r\nspeakers[B] all urged such appointments.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1882 an effort was made in New York city to\r\nsecure the enforcement of the law enacted by the previous\r\nlegislature, which provided that seats should be furnished for the\r\n\"shop-girls.\" Mrs. Emma Gates Conkling caused the arrest of certain\r\nprominent shop-keepers on the charge of not complying with the law,\r\nbut on coming to trial the suits were withdrawn on the promise of\r\nthe delinquents to give seats to their employes.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1882 agitation for the higher education of\r\nwomen was renewed, and a society organized by some of the most\r\ninfluential ladies in the city. They rolled up a petition of 1,200,\r\nasking that Columbia College be opened to women. President Barnard\r\nhad recommended this in his reports for three years. The agitation\r\nculminated in a grand meeting[245] in the new Union League Theater.\r\nParke Godwin of the _Evening Post_ presided. The audience was\r\nchiefly composed of fashionable ladies, whose equipages filled\r\nThirty-eighth street blocks away, yet not a woman sat on the\r\nplatform; not a woman's voice was heard; even the report of the\r\nsociety was read by a man, and every inspiration of the occasion\r\nwas filtered through the brain of some man. Among other things, Mr.\r\nGodwin, son-in-law of the poet Bryant, said:\r\n\r\n     We speak of the higher education of women. Why not also of men?\r\n     Because they already have the opportunity for obtaining it. The\r\n     idea upon which our government is built is the idea of equal\r\n     rights for all; and that means equal opportunities. Every society\r\n     needs all the best intellect that it can get. We have many evil\r\n     influences acting upon our society here, and we need the\r\n     all-controlling influence of woman. We cannot fix a standard for\r\n     her. History shows what she has done, in a Vespasia, Vittoria\r\n     Colonna, De Stael, Bremer, Evans, Somerville and Maria Mitchell.\r\n     She does not go out of her sphere when she is so highly educated.\r\n     She can darn her stockings just as well if she does know the word\r\n     in half-a-dozen languages. There is no longer novelty in this\r\n     movement; it has been tried successfully here and abroad in the\r\n     universities, and always with success.\r\n\r\nAddresses were also made by Rev. Dr. Stowe, Dr. William Draper,\r\nJoseph Choate, and others eminent in one way or another. The\r\nmeeting closed by circulating a petition for presentation to the\r\ntrustees of Columbia College, asking that properly qualified women\r\nbe admitted to lectures and examinations.\r\n\r\nThe bill to prohibit disfranchisement on account of sex was again\r\nintroduced in the Assembly by Hon. J. Hampden Robb, and referred to\r\nthe Committee on Grievances, of which Major James Haggerty was\r\nchairman, who gave to it his hearty approval and granted two\r\nhearings to the officers of the State society, on behalf of the\r\nlarge number of memorialists who had sent in their petitions from\r\nall parts of the State. The women of Albany were indefatigable in\r\ntheir personal appeals to the different members of the Assembly,\r\nurging them to vote for the bill, while Major Haggerty was untiring\r\nin his advocacy of the measure. On May 3 there was an animated\r\ndiscussion:[246] the bill passed to its third reading by an\r\noverwhelming vote, which alarmed the opponents into making a\r\nthorough canvass, that proved to them the necessity of some\r\ndecisive action for the defeat of the bill. The Hon. Erastas Brooks\r\npresented a resolution, calling on the attorney-general for his\r\nopinion on the constitutionality of the proposed law, which was\r\npassed in a moment of confusion, and when many of our friends were\r\nabsent. Following is the opinion elicited:\r\n\r\n\r\n                  STATE OF NEW YORK. OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL,}\r\n                                               ALBANY, May 10, 1882.}\r\n\r\n     _To the Assembly:_\r\n\r\n     I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the resolution of\r\n     the Assembly requesting the attorney-general to report his\r\n     opinion as to the constitutionality of Assembly bill No. 637,\r\n     which provides that \"every woman shall be free to vote under the\r\n     qualifications required of men, or to refrain from voting, as she\r\n     may choose; and no person shall be debarred by reason of sex from\r\n     voting at any election, or at any town meeting, school meeting,\r\n     or other choice of government functionaries whatsoever,\" and\r\n     whether, without an amendment to the constitution, suffrage can\r\n     be granted to any class of persons not named in the constitution.\r\n     I reply:\r\n\r\n     _First_--It has been decided so often by the judicial tribunals\r\n     of the various States of the Union, and by the Supreme Court of\r\n     the United States, that suffrage is not a natural inherent right,\r\n     but one governed by the law-making power and regulated by\r\n     questions of availability and expediency, instead of absolute,\r\n     inalienable right (1, 3), that the question is no longer open for\r\n     discussion, either by the judicial forum or legislative\r\n     assemblies (_Burnham vs. Laning, 1 Legal Gazette Rep., 411,\r\n     Supreme Court Penn.; Minor vs. Happersett, 21 Wallace, 162; Day\r\n     vs. Jones, 31 California, 261; Anderson vs. Baker, 23 Maryland,\r\n     531; Abbott vs. Bayley, 6 Pickering, 92; 2 Dallas, 471-2; In re\r\n     Susan B. Anthony, 11 Blatchford, 200_). At the common law women\r\n     had no right to vote and no political status (2, 4) (_Maine's\r\n     Ancient Law, 140; Cooley's Const. Lim., 599; Blackstone's Comm.,\r\n     171_).\r\n\r\n     _Second_--Therefore the constitution of the State of New York,\r\n     providing that every male citizen of the age of 21 years who\r\n     shall have certain other qualifications, may vote, the\r\n     determination of the organic law specifying who shall have the\r\n     privilege of voting, excludes all other classes (5), such as\r\n     women, persons under 21 years of age and aliens. The argument\r\n     that, because women are not expressly prohibited, they may vote,\r\n     fails to give the slightest force to the term \"male\" in the\r\n     constitution; and by the same force of reasoning, the expression\r\n     of the term \"citizen\" and the statement of the age of 21 years\r\n     would not necessarily exclude aliens and those under 21 years of\r\n     age from voting (6). Therefore, assuming that our organic law was\r\n     properly adopted without the participation of women either in\r\n     making or adopting it (7), that organic law controls.\r\n\r\n     _Third_--It follows, therefore, as a logical consequence that the\r\n     proposed reform cannot be accomplished except by an amendment of\r\n     the constitution ratified by two successive legislatures and the\r\n     people, or by a constitutional convention, whose work shall be\r\n     sanctioned by a vote of the people.\r\n\r\n                         LESLIE W. RUSSELL, _Attorney-General_.[247]\r\n\r\nWeak as was this document, and untenable as were its assertions, it\r\nhad great weight with many of the members of the legislature coming\r\nas the opinion did from the attorney-general of the State. The\r\nfriends of the bill resolved to call for the vote when the bill\r\nshould be reached, and on May 16, the women were present in large\r\nnumbers, listening with intense interest to the brief speeches of\r\nthe members for and against, and watching and counting the vote as\r\nthe roll-call proceeded, which resulted in 54 ayes and 59 noes,\r\nlacking three votes of a majority of those present and only eleven\r\nof the requisite number, sixty-five. In view of the official\r\nopinion against its constitutionality amounting to a legal\r\ndecision, this was a most gratifying vote.[248]\r\n\r\nThe presence of Leslie W. Russell in Albany, as attorney-general,\r\nrendered it useless to reintroduce the bill to prohibit\r\ndisfranchisement on account of sex in the legislature of 1883, but\r\nin its stead, Dr. John G. Boyd of New York introduced a proposition\r\nto strike \"male\" from the suffrage clause of the constitution,\r\nwhich, however, received only fifteen votes.\r\n\r\nTo pass from the State to the Church, the winter of 1883 was\r\nnotable for the delivery of a series of Lenten lectures on woman by\r\nthe Rev. Morgan Dix, D. D., rector of Trinity Church, New York,\r\nafterwards published in book form under the title, \"The Calling of\r\na Christian Woman and her Training to Fulfill it.\" The lectures\r\nwere delivered each Friday evening during Lent, in Trinity Chapel,\r\nand at once attracted attention from their conservative,\r\nreaectionary, almost monastic views of woman's position and duties.\r\n\r\nAfter reading a report of one of these remarkable essays in which\r\nwomen were gravely told their highest happiness should be found in\r\nsinging hymns, Mrs. Blake decided to reply to them. She secured a\r\nhall on Fourteenth street, and on successive Sunday evenings gave\r\naddresses in reply. Both courses of lectures were well attended.\r\nThe moderate audiences of Trinity Chapel soon became a throng that\r\nmore than filled the large building, while the hall in which Mrs.\r\nBlake spoke was packed to suffocation, hundreds going away unable\r\nto gain admittance. The press everywhere favored the broad and\r\nliberal views presented by Mrs. Blake, and denounced the old-time\r\nnarrow theories of Dr. Dix. Mrs. Blake's lectures were also\r\npublished in book form with the title of \"Woman's Place To-day\" and\r\nhad a large circulation.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans again nominating Mr. Russell for attorney-general,\r\nan active campaign was organized against him and in favor of the\r\nDemocratic nominee, Mr. Dennis O'Brien. Protests[249] against\r\nRussell were circulated throughout the State; Republican tickets\r\nwere printed with the name of Denis O'Brien for attorney-general,\r\nand on election day women distributed these tickets, and made every\r\npossible effort to ensure the defeat of Russell; and he was\r\ndefeated by 13,000 votes.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of 1884 showed a marked gain; Hon. Erastus Brooks,\r\nGeneral George A. Sharpe, and other prominent opponents had been\r\nretired, and their seats filled by active friends. Our bill was\r\nintroduced by Mr. William Howland of Cayuga, and referred to the\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary. Mr. Howland also secured the passage of\r\na special act, granting women the right to vote at the charter\r\nelections of Union Springs, Cayuga county. Under similar enactments\r\nwomen have the right to vote for municipal officers in Dansville,\r\nNewport and other villages and towns in the State.\r\n\r\nOn March 11, 12, the annual meeting of the State society was held\r\nin the City Hall, Albany, with a good representation[250] from the\r\nNational Convention at Washington, added to our own State\r\nspeakers.[251] On the last evening there was an overflow meeting\r\nheld in Geological Hall, presided over by Mrs. Matilda Joslyn Gage.\r\n\r\nGovernor Cleveland accorded the delegates a most courteous\r\nreception in his room in the capitol. A hearing was had before the\r\nJudiciary Committee March 13. The assembly-chamber was crowded.\r\nGeneral Husted, chairman of the committee, presided, and Mrs.\r\nBlake, the president of the society, introduced the speakers.[252]\r\nA few days later the same committee gave a special hearing to Mrs.\r\nGougar, who made the journey from Indiana to present the case. The\r\ncommittee reported adversely, but by the able tactics of General\r\nHusted, after an animated debate the bill was placed on the\r\ncalendar by a vote of 66 to 62, and shortly after ordered to a\r\nthird reading by a vote of 74 to 39. On May 8 the bill was reached\r\nfor final action. Frederick B. Howe of New York was the principal\r\nopponent, trying to obstruct legislation by one and another\r\npretext. General Husted took the floor in an able speech on the\r\nconstitutionality of the bill, and the vote stood 57 ayes to 61\r\nnoes, lacking eight votes of the requisite 65.\r\n\r\nWhile the right of suffrage is still denied, gains in personal and\r\nproperty rights have been granted:\r\n\r\n     In 1880, the law requiring the private acknowledgment by a\r\n     married woman of her execution of deeds, or other written\r\n     instruments, without the \"fear or compulsion\" of her husband, was\r\n     abolished, leaving the wife to make, take and certify in the same\r\n     manner as if she were a _feme sole_.\r\n\r\n     March 21, 1884, the penal code of the State was amended, raising\r\n     the age of consent from ten to sixteen years, and also providing\r\n     penalties[253] for inveigling or enticing any unmarried woman,\r\n     under the age of twenty-five years, into a house of ill-fame or\r\n     assignation.\r\n\r\n     Under the act of May 28, 1884, a married woman may contract to\r\n     the same extent, with like effect and in the same form as if\r\n     unmarried, and she and her separate estate shall be liable\r\n     thereon, whether such contract relates to her separate business\r\n     or estate, or otherwise, and in no case shall a charge upon her\r\n     separate estate be necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is by court decisions that we most readily learn the legal\r\nstatus of married women, under the favorable legislation of the\r\nperiod covered by this History. While referring the reader to\r\nAbbott's Digest of New York Laws for full knowledge upon this\r\npoint, we give a few of the more recent decisions as illustrating\r\ngeneral legal opinion:\r\n\r\n     TROY, March 23, 1882.--The Court of Appeals decided that married\r\n     women are the rightful owners of articles of personal adornment\r\n     or convenience coming from husbands, and can bequeath them to\r\n     their heirs. The court held that separate and personal possession\r\n     by a wife of articles specially fitted for and adapted to her\r\n     personal use, and differing in that respect from household goods\r\n     kept for the common use of husband and wife, would draw after it\r\n     a presumption of the executed gift if the property came from the\r\n     husband, and of the wife's ownership, but for disabilities of the\r\n     marital relations. Now that these disabilities are removed the\r\n     separate existence and separate property of the wife are\r\n     recognized, and her capacity to take and hold as her own the gift\r\n     in good faith and fairly made to her by her husband established,\r\n     it seemed to the court time to clothe her right with natural and\r\n     proper attributes, and apply to the gift to her, although made by\r\n     her husband, the general rules of law unmodified and unimpaired\r\n     by the old disabilities of the marriage relations.\r\n\r\nThis decision was important as further destroying the old\r\ncommon-law theory of the husband's absolute ownership of his wife's\r\nperson, property, services and earnings. The same year (1882) the\r\nSupreme Court, at its general term, rendered a decision that a\r\nmarried woman could sue her husband for damages for assault and\r\nbattery; that by the act of 1860 the legislature intended to, and\r\ndid, change the common-law rule, that a wife could not sue her\r\nhusband. Judge Brady rendered the opinion, Judge Daniels\r\nconcurring; Presiding Judge Noah Davis dissenting. Judge Brady\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     To allow the right (to sue) in an action of this character, in\r\n     accordance with the language of the statute, would be to promote\r\n     greater harmony by enlarging the rights of married women and\r\n     increasing the obligations of husbands, by affording greater\r\n     protection to the former, and by enforcing greater restraint upon\r\n     the latter in the indulgence of their evil passions. The\r\n     declaration of such a rule is not against the policy of the law.\r\n     It is in harmony with it, and calculated to preserve peace and,\r\n     in a great measure, prevent barbarous acts, acts of cruelty,\r\n     regarded by mankind as inexcusable, contemptible, detestable. It\r\n     is neither too early nor too late to promulgate the doctrine that\r\n     if a husband commits an assault and battery upon his wife he may\r\n     be held responsible civilly and criminally for the act, which is\r\n     not only committed in violation of the laws of God and man, but\r\n     in direct antagonism to the contract of marriage, its\r\n     obligations, duties, responsibilities, and the very basis on\r\n     which it rests. The rules of the common law on this subject have\r\n     been dispelled, routed, and justly so, by the acts of 1860 and\r\n     1862. They are things of the past which have succumbed to more\r\n     liberal and just views, like many other doctrines of the common\r\n     law which could not stand the scrutiny and analysis of modern\r\n     civilization.\r\n\r\nThe utter insecurity of woman without the ballot is shown in the\r\nreversal of this decision within a few months, by the Court of\r\nAppeals, on the ground that it would be \"contrary to the policy of\r\nthe law, and destructive to the conjugal union and tranquility\r\nwhich it had always been the object of the law to guard and\r\nprotect.\" Could satire go farther? We record with satisfaction the\r\nfact that Judge Danforth uttered a strong dissenting opinion.\r\n\r\nThe friends of woman suffrage in the legislature of 1884 secured\r\nthe passage of a bill empowering women to vote on all questions of\r\ntaxation submitted to a popular vote in the village of Union\r\nSprings. Governor Cleveland was urged to veto it; but after hearing\r\nall the objections he signed the bill and it became a law.\r\n\r\nAt Clinton, Oneida county, twenty-two women voted on June 21, 1884,\r\nat an election on the question of establishing water-works. Eight\r\nvoted for the tax, fourteen against it. Fifteen other women\r\nappeared at the polls, but were excluded from voting because,\r\nthough they were real-estate tax-payers, the assessor had left\r\ntheir names off the tax-roll. Judge Theodore W. Dwight, president\r\nof the Columbia Law School, pronounced women tax-payers entitled to\r\nvote under the general water-works act, and therefore that the\r\nelection-officials violated the law in refusing to accept the votes\r\nof the women whose names were omitted from the assessors' tax-list.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, there was a report of the committee to allow widows an\r\nactive voice in the settlement of the family estate and to have the\r\nsole guardianship of minor children. A petition in favor of the\r\nbill had upon it the names of such well-known men as Peter Cooper,\r\nGeorge William Curtis, Henry Bergh and J. W. Simonton.\r\n\r\nSeptember 13, 1879, Mrs. MacDonald of Boston argued her own case\r\nbefore the United States Circuit Court in New York city, in a\r\npatent suit. It was a marked event in court circles, she being the\r\nfirst lady pleader that ever appeared in that court, and the second\r\nwoman who ever argued a case in this State. Anne Bradstreet was for\r\nyears a marked character in Albany courts, but her claims for\r\njustice were regarded as an amusing lunacy.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, Governor Cornell appointed Miss Carpenter on the State\r\nBoard of Charities.\r\n\r\nIn the suit of Mr. Edward Jones to recover $860 which he alleged he\r\nhad loaned to the Rev. Anna Oliver for the Willoughby Avenue\r\nMethodist Episcopal Church, Brooklyn, of which she was pastor, a\r\nverdict for the defendant was rendered. Miss Oliver addressed the\r\nfollowing letter to the court:\r\n\r\n     _To his Honor, the Judge, the Intelligent Jury, the Lawyers and\r\n     all who are engaged in the case of Jones vs. Oliver_:\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN:--Thanking you for the politeness, the courtesy, the\r\n     chivalry even, that has been shown me to-day, allow me to make of\r\n     you the following request: Please sit down at your earliest\r\n     leisure, and endeavor to realize in imagination how you would\r\n     feel if you were sued by a woman, and the case was brought before\r\n     a court composed entirely of women; the judge a woman; every\r\n     member of the jury a woman; women to read the oath to you, and\r\n     hold the Bible, and every lawyer a woman. Further, your case to\r\n     be tried under laws framed entirely by women, in which neither\r\n     you nor any man had ever been allowed a voice. Somewhat as you\r\n     would feel under such circumstances, you may be assured, on\r\n     reading this, I have felt during the trial to-day. Perhaps the\r\n     women would be lenient to you (the sexes do favor each other),\r\n     but would you be satisfied? Would you feel that such an\r\n     arrangement was exactly the just and fair thing? If you would\r\n     not, I ask you on the principle of the Golden Rule, to use your\r\n     influence for the enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\n     _New York, 1881._\r\n\r\nMrs. Roebling, wife of the engineer in charge of the construction\r\nof the marvelous Brooklyn bridge, made the patterns for various\r\nnecessary shapes of iron and steel such as no mills were making,\r\nafter her husband and other engineers had for weeks puzzled their\r\nbrains over the difficulties.\r\n\r\nWhen Frank Leslie died, his printing-house was involved, and Mrs.\r\nLeslie undertook to redeem it, which she did, and in a very short\r\ntime. Speaking of it she says:\r\n\r\n     \"I had the property in reach, and the assignees were ready to\r\n     turn it over to me, but to get it, it was necessary for me to\r\n     raise $50,000, I borrowed it from a woman. How happy I was when\r\n     she signed the check, and how beautiful it seemed to me to see\r\n     one woman helping another. I borrowed the money in June, and was\r\n     to make the first payment of $5,000, on the 1st of November. On\r\n     the 29th of October I paid the $50,000 with interest. From June\r\n     to the 29th of October, I made $50,000 clear. I had also to pay\r\n     $30,000 to the creditors who did not come under the contract.\r\n     While I was paying this $80,000 of my husband's debts, I spent\r\n     but $30 for myself, except for my board. I lived in a little\r\n     attic room, without a carpet, and the window was so high that I\r\n     could not get a glimpse of the sky unless I stood on a chair and\r\n     looked out. When I had paid the debts and raised a monument to my\r\n     husband, then I said to myself, 'now for a great big pair of\r\n     diamond earrings,' and away I went to Europe, and here are the\r\n     diamonds.\" The diamonds are perfect matches, twenty-seven carats\r\n     in weight, and are nearly as large as nickles.\r\n\r\nIn Lansingburgh the women tax-payers offered their ballots and were\r\nrepulsed, as follows:\r\n\r\n     September 2, 1885, the special election of the taxable\r\n     inhabitants of the village of Lansingburgh took place, to vote\r\n     upon a proposition to raise by tax the sum of $15,000 for\r\n     water-works purposes. The measure was voted by 102 for it to 46\r\n     against. But a small amount of interest was manifested in the\r\n     election. Several women tax-payers offered their votes, but the\r\n     inspectors would not receive them, and the matter will be\r\n     contested in the courts. The call for the election asked for an\r\n     expression from \"the taxable inhabitants,\" and women tax-payers\r\n     in the 'burgh claim under the law their rights must be\r\n     recognized. Lansingburgh inspectors have on numerous occasions\r\n     refused to receive the ballots thus tendered, and the women have\r\n     lost patience. They are to employ the best of counsel and settle\r\n     the question at as early a day as possible. Women pay tax upon\r\n     $367,394 of the property within the village boundaries, and they\r\n     believe that they, to the number of 317 at least, are entitled to\r\n     votes on all questions involving a monetary expenditure. In\r\n     Saratoga, Clinton, and a number of other places in this State,\r\n     where elections in relation to water-works have taken place, it\r\n     has been held by legal authority that women property owners have\r\n     a right to vote, and they have voted accordingly the same as\r\n     other tax-payers.\r\n\r\nIn regard to recent efforts to secure legislation favorable to\r\nwomen, Mr. Wilcox writes:\r\n\r\n     The impression that the School Act, passed in 1880, did not apply\r\n     to cities, led to the introduction by the Hon. Charles S. Baker\r\n     of Rochester, of a bill covering cities. A test vote showed the\r\n     Assembly practically unanimous for it, but it was referred to the\r\n     Judiciary Committee to examine its constitutionality. The\r\n     chairman, Hon. Geo. L. Ferry, and other members, asked me to\r\n     look up the point and inform the committee, supposing a\r\n     constitutional amendment needful. When the point was made on this\r\n     bill, I for the first time closely examined the constitution, and\r\n     finding there was nought to prevent the legislature enfranchising\r\n     anyone, promptly apprised the committee of the discovery. The\r\n     acting-chairman, Major Wm. D. Brennan, requested me to furnish\r\n     the committee a legal brief on the matter. This (Feb. 19, 1880) I\r\n     did, and arranged a public hearing before them in the\r\n     assembly-chamber, which was attended by Governor Cornell,\r\n     Lieutenant-Governor Hoskins, many senators, assemblymen, and\r\n     State officers; at which Mrs. Blake, the sainted Helen M. Slocum\r\n     and Mrs. Elizabeth L. Saxon were the speakers. From that year to\r\n     the present there has been a \"Bill to Prohibit Disfranchisement\"\r\n     before each legislature. In 1881, it was carried to a majority\r\n     vote in the Assembly. In 1883, two-thirds of the Assembly were\r\n     ready to pass the bill when the attorney-general declared it\r\n     unconstitutional. In 1884, Governor Cleveland had approved two\r\n     suffrage acts, and promised to sign all the friends could carry.\r\n     In 1885, growing tired of the senseless clamor of\r\n     \"unconstitutionality,\" I resolved to show how little law the\r\n     clamorers knew. To the knowledge gained by five years'\r\n     discussion, I added that obtained by several months' research in\r\n     the State Library at Albany, that of the New York Bar\r\n     Association, those of the New York Law Institute and Columbia\r\n     College, and elsewhere. The result was the publication of \"Cases\r\n     of the Legislature's Power over Suffrage,\" wherein it was shown,\r\n     condensed from a great number of authorities, that all classes\r\n     have received suffrage, not from the constitution but from the\r\n     legislature, and that the latter has exercised the power of\r\n     extending suffrage in hundreds of cases. This document received\r\n     high praise from General James W. Husted and Major James\r\n     Haggerty, who have manfully championed our bills in the Assembly,\r\n     General Husted reading from it in his speech and it was signally\r\n     sanctioned by the Assembly which, after being supplied with\r\n     copies, voted down by more than three to one a motion to\r\n     substitute a constitutional amendment.\r\n\r\n     But while working at this document, I was fortunate enough to\r\n     make a still greater discovery--that portions of statute law\r\n     which formerly prevented women's voting were repealed long since;\r\n     that the constitution and statutes in their present shape secure\r\n     women the legal right to vote.\r\n\r\nFebruary 19, 1885, a hearing was granted to Mrs. Stanton, Mrs.\r\nRogers and Mrs. Blake in the assembly-chamber before the Committee\r\non Grievances, on the \"Bill to Prohibit Disfranchisement.\" The\r\nsplendid auditorium was crowded for two hours, and members of the\r\ncommittee lingered a long time after the audience had dispersed to\r\ndiscuss the whole question still further with the speakers. On the\r\nnext day Mrs. Mary Seymour Howell and Governor John W. Hoyt of\r\nWyoming Territory had a second hearing. The committee reported for\r\nconsideration. When the bill came up for a third reading, General\r\nMartin L. Curtis of St. Lawrence moved that it be sent to\r\nthe Judiciary Committee with instructions to substitute a\r\nconstitutional amendment; lost, ayes 25, noes 75; carried to a\r\nthird reading by _viva voce_ vote. The vote on the final passage\r\nwas, ayes 57, noes 56; the constitutional majority in this State\r\nbeing 65 of the 128 members, it was lost by eight votes. Of the 73\r\nRepublicans, 29 voted for the bill; of the 55 Democrats, 28 voted\r\nfor the bill, showing that more than half the Democratic vote was\r\nin favor, and only two-fifths of the Republican; thus our defeat\r\nwas due to the Republican party.\r\n\r\nThus stands the question of woman suffrage in the Empire State\r\nto-day, where women are in the majority.[254] After long years of\r\nunremitting efforts who can read this chapter of woman's faith and\r\npatience, under such oft-repeated disappointments, but with pity\r\nfor her humiliations and admiration for her courage and\r\npersistence. For nearly half a century the petitions, the appeals,\r\nthe arguments of the women of New York have been before the\r\nlegislature for consideration, and the trivial concessions of\r\njustice thus far wrung from our rulers bear no proportion to the\r\nprolonged labors we have gone through to achieve them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[200] It has recently been ascertained that the first woman's\r\nrights petition sent to the New York State legislature was by Miss\r\nMary Ayers, in 1834, for a change in the property laws. It was ten\r\nor fifteen feet long when unrolled, and is still buried in the\r\nvaults of the capitol at Albany.\r\n\r\n[201] Many years afterwards, lecturing in Texas, I met a party of\r\nladies from Georgia, thoroughly awake on all questions relating to\r\nwomen. Finding ourselves quite in accord, I said, \"how did you get\r\nthose ideas in Georgia?\" \"Why,\" said one, \"some of our friends\r\nattended a woman's convention at Saratoga, and told us what was\r\nsaid there, and gave us several tracts on all phases of the\r\nquestion, which were the chief topics of discussion among us long\r\nafter.\" Southern women have suffered so many evils growing out of\r\nthe system of slavery that they readily learn the lessons of\r\nfreedom.--[E.

See Vol. II., page 402, for\r\nMrs. Burleigh's letter on this Saratoga convention.\r\n\r\n[204] The Board of Trustees of Mt. Vernon, Westchester county,\r\ncalled a meeting of taxpayers of that village on July 19, 1868, to\r\nvote upon the question of levying a tax of $6,000 for the purpose\r\nof making and repairing highways and sidewalks, and for sundry\r\nother public improvements. Over sixty per cent. of the real-estate\r\nowners being women, they resolved upon asserting their right to a\r\nvoice in the matter, and issued a call for a meeting, signed by the\r\nfollowing influential ladies: Mrs. M. J. Law, Mrs. H. H. Leaver,\r\nMrs. Olive Leaver, Mrs. J. Haggerty, Mary H. Macdonald, Mrs.\r\nDorothy Ferguson, Mrs. M. J. Farrand, Mrs. Jeanette Oron, Mrs.\r\nThirza Clark, Mrs. S. J.

But notwithstanding the\r\nnumbers, wealth, and social influence of the women, their demand\r\nwas rejected, while hundreds of men, who had never paid a dollar's\r\ntax into the village treasury, were permitted to deposit their\r\nvotes, though challenged by friends, and well known to the officers\r\nas not possessors of a foot of real estate.\r\n\r\n[205] The Working Women's Association was organized in New York,\r\nSeptember 17, 1868, with Mrs. Anna Tobitt, _President_;\r\nMiss Augusta Lewis, Miss Susan Johns, Miss Mary Peers.\r\n_Vice-Presidents_; Miss Elizabeth C. Browne, _Secretary_, and Miss\r\nJulia Browne, _Treasurer_. The three vice-presidents were young\r\nladies of about twenty. Miss Lewis worked upon a newly invented\r\ntype-setting machine.\r\n\r\n[206] \"Sergeant Robinson, of the Twenty-sixth Precinct, made a raid\r\non the abandoned women patroling the park last evening. At 11 p. m.\r\nsix unfortunates were caged.\" Thus runs the record. Will some one\r\nnow be kind enough to tell us whether Sergeant Robinson, or any\r\nother sergeant, made a raid upon the abandoned men who were\r\npatrolling Broadway at the same hour? Did any one on that night,\r\nor, indeed, upon any other night, within the memory of the oldest\r\nKnickerbocker, make a raid upon the gamblers, thieves, drunkards\r\nand panders that infest Houston street? By what authority do the\r\npolice call women \"abandoned\" and arrest them because they are\r\npatrolling any public park or square? If these women belonged to\r\nthe class euphemistically called \"unfortunate,\" they were doubtless\r\nthere because men were already there before them. And if it was\r\nillegal in women and deserving of punishment, why should men\r\nescape? _Prima facie_, if crime were committed, the latter are the\r\ngreater criminals of the two. We humbly suggest to all who are\r\nendeavoring to reform this class of women, that they turn their\r\nattention to reforming the opposite sex. If you can make men so\r\npure that they will not seek the society of prostitutes, you will\r\nsoon have no prostitutes for them to seek; in other words,\r\nprostitution will cease when men become sufficiently pure to make\r\nno demand for prostitutes. In any event, the police should treat\r\nboth sexes alike. Making a raid, as it is called, upon abandoned\r\nwomen, and shutting them up in prison, never can procure good\r\nresults. The most repulsive and bestial features of \"the social\r\nevil\" have their origin in the treatment that women receive at the\r\nhands of the police; and society itself would be much better if the\r\npolice would keep their hands off such women.--[P. P. in _The\r\nRevolution_.\r\n\r\n[207] An important decision relating to the eligibility of\r\ncandidates for the Cornell free scholarship has been rendered by\r\nJudge Martin of the Supreme Court. Mary E. Wright, who stood third\r\nin the recent examination here for the scholarship, contested the\r\nappointment on the ground that the candidates who were first and\r\nsecond in the examination were not pupils of a school in the\r\ncounty. The judge decided that candidates for the position must be\r\nresidents of the county and pupils of a school therein, to be\r\neligible, and he awarded the scholarship to Miss Wright. This is\r\nthe first contested scholarship since the establishment of the\r\nUniversity.--_Ithaca dispatch to New York Times._\r\n\r\n[208] Dr. Lewis H. Morgan, who died in 1882, famed in both\r\nhemispheres as an ethnologist, left a considerable estate to be\r\ndevoted at the death of his wife (which has since occurred) and of\r\nhis son without issue, to the establishment, in connection with the\r\nUniversity of Rochester, of a collegiate institution for women.\r\nThis makes it very probable that Rochester will ultimately offer\r\nequal opportunities to both sexes.\r\n\r\n[209] At one time it was said that Hobart College had more\r\nprofessors than students, and one year had arrived at such a point\r\nof exhaustion as to graduate but one young man. When the\r\nproposition to incorporate Geneva Medical College with the Syracuse\r\nUniversity was made, Hon. George F. Comstock, a trustee of the\r\nlatter institution, vigorously opposed it unless equal advantages\r\nwere pledged to women.\r\n\r\n[210] See Volume II., page 264.\r\n\r\n[211] The twelve were:. Mrs. H. M. Field, Mrs. Anna Lynch Botta,\r\nMiss Kate Field, Mrs. Anna B. Allen, Miss Josephine Pollard, Mrs.\r\nCelia Burleigh, Mrs. Fanny Barrow, Mrs. C. B. Wilbour, Mrs. J.

Olympia\r\nBrown, Matilda Joslyn Gage, Dr. Clemence Lozier, Helen M. Slocum,\r\nLillie Devereux Blake.\r\n\r\n[217] Lillie Devereux Blake was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, in\r\nAugust, 1833. Her father, George Devereux, was a wealthy Southern\r\ngentleman of Irish descent. Her mother's maiden name was Sarah\r\nElizabeth Johnson of Stratford, Connecticut, a descendant of\r\nWilliam Samuel Johnson who was one of the first two senators from\r\nthat State. Both her parents were descended from Jonathan Edwards.\r\nHer father died in 1837, and the widow subsequently removed to New\r\nHaven, Conn., where she was well known for her large and generous\r\nhospitality. Her daughter, the future favorite writer and lecturer,\r\nwas a much admired belle, and in 1855 was married to Frank Umsted,\r\na lawyer of Philadelphia, with whom she lived two years in St.\r\nLouis, Mo. Mr. Umsted died in 1859, and his widow, who had written\r\nsketches for _Harper's Magazine_ and published a novel called\r\n\"Southwold,\" from that date contributed largely to leading\r\nnewspapers and magazines. She was Washington correspondent of the\r\n_Evening Post_ in the winter of 1861, published \"Rockford\" in 1862,\r\nand wrote many stories for _Frank Leslie's Weekly_, the\r\n_Philadelphia Press_ and other publications. In 1866 she married\r\nGreenfill Blake of New York. In 1872 Mrs. Blake published \"Fettered\r\nfor Life,\" a novel designed to show the legal disadvantages of\r\nwomen. Ever since she became interested in the suffrage movement\r\nMrs. Blake has been one of the most ardent advocates. She has taken\r\nseveral lecturing tours in different States of the Union. Mrs.\r\nBlake is an easy speaker and writer, and of late has contributed to\r\nmany of our popular magazines. Much of the recent work in the New\r\nYork legislature is due to her untiring zeal.\r\n\r\n[218] Mrs. Jennie McAdam, Mrs. Hester Poole, Charlotte Coleman,\r\nMrs. Hull, Mrs. Morse and others. A month before, January 23, Miss\r\nAnthony was invited to address the commission, giving her\r\nconstitutional argument, showing woman's right to vote under the\r\nfourteenth amendment. Hon. Henry R. Selden was in the audience,\r\nbeing in the city on Miss Anthony's case. At the close of her\r\nargument he said: \"If I had heard that speech before, I could have\r\nmade a stronger plea before Judge Hall this morning.\"\r\n\r\n[219] She was escorted to the capitol by Phoebe H. Jones and the\r\nvenerable Lydia Mott, who for a quarter of a century had\r\nentertained at their respective homes the various speakers that had\r\ncome to Albany to plead for new liberties, and had accompanied\r\nthem, one after another, to the halls of legislation.\r\n\r\n[220] Addressed by Mrs. Wilbour, Mrs. Blake, Mrs. Lozier, Mrs.\r\nHallock, Hamilton Wilcox and Dr. Hallock.\r\n\r\n[221] For Judge Hunt's decision, see Volume II., page 677.\r\n\r\n[222] Miss Charlotte C.

In 1867, Mrs. Stanton had made a similar\r\napplication to Theodore D. Dwight, that the law school might be\r\nopened to young women. In the course of their conversation\r\nProfessor Dwight said; \"Do you think girls know enough to study\r\nlaw?\" Mrs. Stanton replied: \"All the liberal laws for women that\r\nhave been passed in the last twenty years are the results of the\r\nprotests of women; surely, if they know enough to protest against\r\nbad laws, they know enough to study our whole system of\r\njurisprudence.\"\r\n\r\n[223] It was peculiarly fitting that this application should be\r\nmade by Mrs. Blake, as two of her ancestors had been presidents of\r\nthe college. The first it ever had, when founded as King's\r\nCollege in 1700, was the Rev. Samuel Johnson, D. D., her\r\ngreat-great-grandfather. His son, the Hon. Samuel William Johnson,\r\nwas the first president after the Revolution, when the name was\r\nchanged to Columbia College.\r\n\r\n[224] Julia Ward Howe, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Antoinette Brown\r\nBlackwell, Mary F.

Buckingham, and others.\r\n\r\n[225] Dr. Clemence Lozier was born of a good family in New Jersey.\r\nShe was married at the early age of 16, and widowed at 27, left\r\nwith a young family without means of support. But being an\r\nexcellent teacher, she soon found employment. For eleven years she\r\nwas principal of a young ladies' seminary. By natural instinct a\r\nphysician and a healer, she determined to fit herself for that\r\nprofession. A physician of the old school assisted her in her\r\nmedical studies, and in 1853 she received a diploma from the\r\nEclectic College of Syracuse, and shortly after established herself\r\nin New York, where her practice steadily increased, until her\r\nprofessional income was one of the largest in the city. In 1860 she\r\nbegan a course of free medical lectures to women, which continued\r\nfor three years, culminating in \"The New York Medical College for\r\nWomen,\" which was chartered in 1863. The foundation and\r\nestablishment of this institution was the crowning work of her\r\nlife, to which she has devoted time and money. From the first she\r\nhas been dean of the faculty, and after years of struggle at last\r\nhas the satisfaction of seeing it a complete success, owning a fine\r\nbuilding up town, with hospital and dispensary attached.\r\n\r\n[226] Several ladies appeared last week before the New York\r\nSupervisors' Committee to protest against excessive taxation. The\r\nNew York _World_ informs us that Mrs. Harriet Ramsen complained\r\nthat the appraisement of lot 5 West One Hundred and Twenty-second\r\nstreet, was increased from $7,000 to $9,000. Mrs. P. P. Dickinson,\r\nhouse 48 West Fifty-sixth street, increased from $15,000 to\r\n$20,000; Mrs. Cynthia Bunce, house 37 West Fifty-fourth street,\r\nlast year's valuation $10,000; this year's, $15,000. Mrs. Daly, who\r\nowns a house in Seventy-second street, informed the committee that\r\nthe assessment on the house (a small dwelling) was put at $2,000,\r\nan increase of $700 over last year's valuation. This house stands\r\nin an unopened street. Supervisor McCafferty said that the\r\ncommittee would do all in its power to have the assessment reduced,\r\nand also remarked that it was a positive outrage to assess such a\r\nsmall house at so high a figure. Mrs. Louisa St. John, who is\r\nreputed to be worth $2,000,000, complained because three lots on\r\nFifth avenue, near Eighty-sixth street, and five lots on the\r\nlast-named street, have been assessed at much higher figures than\r\nother lots in the neighborhood. Mrs. St. John addressed the\r\ncommittee with much eloquence and force. Said she: \"I do not\r\ncomplain of the assessments that have been laid on my property. I\r\ncomplain of the inequalities practiced by the assessors, and I\r\nshould like to see them set right.\" Supervisor McCafferty assured\r\nMrs. St. John that everything in the power of the committee would\r\nbe done to equalize assessments in future. Mrs. St. John is a heavy\r\nspeculator in real estate. She attends sales and has property\r\n\"knocked down\" to her. She makes all her own searches in the\r\nregister's office, and is known, in fact, among property-owners as\r\na very thorough real-estate lawyer. Many years ago she was the\r\nproprietor of the Globe Hotel, now Frankfort House, corner of\r\nFrankfort and William streets.\r\n\r\n[227] The Albany _Evening Journal_ of January 22 said: A hearing\r\nwas granted by the Judiciary Committee to-night, on the petition of\r\nthe Woman's Tax-payers Association of the City of Rochester, for\r\neither representation or relief from taxation. The petitioners were\r\nheard in the assembly chamber, and in addition to members of the\r\ncommittee, a large audience of ladies and gentlemen were drawn\r\ntogether, including the president of the Senate, speaker of the\r\nHouse, and nearly all the leading members of both branches of the\r\nlegislature. The first speaker was Mrs. Blake, the youngest of the\r\ntrio, who occupied about twenty minutes and was well received. She\r\nwas followed by Miss Anthony, who made a telling speech, frequently\r\neliciting applause. She recounted her long service in the woman's\r\nrights cause, and gave a brief history of the different enactments\r\nand repeals on the question for the last thirty years. She related\r\nher experience in voting, and said she was fined $100 and costs,\r\none cent of which she had never paid and never meant to. She\r\nclaimed Judge Waite was in favor of woman suffrage, and believed\r\nthe present speaker of the Assembly of New York was also in favor\r\nof the movement. Calls being made for General Husted, that\r\ngentleman replied that Miss Anthony was perfectly correct in her\r\nstatement. She summed up by asking the committee to report in favor\r\nof legislation exempting women from taxation unless represented by\r\nthe ballot, remarking that she would not ask for the right to vote,\r\nas that was guaranteed her by the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. Miss Anthony then introduced Mrs. Joslyn Gage, who said if\r\nany member of the committee had objections to offer or questions to\r\nask she would like the privilege of answering; but as none of the\r\ncommittee availed themselves, she proceeded for fifteen minutes in\r\nabout the same strain as her predecessors. Calls being made for Mr.\r\nSpencer and eliciting no reply from that gentleman, Mrs. Blake said\r\nthey should consider him a convert.\r\n\r\n[228] The speakers were Dr. Clemence Lozier, Helen M. Slocum,\r\nHenrietta Westbrook, Mrs. Devereux Blake. Mrs. J. E. Frobisher\r\nrecited Paul Revere's ride, and Helen M. Cooke read the\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\n[229] Helen M. Slocum, Dr. Clemence Lozier, Mrs. Devereux Blake.\r\n\r\n[230] Miss King, the head of a New York tea-dealing firm composed\r\nof women, who control a capital of $1,000,000, has recently gone to\r\nChina to make purchases. Her previous business experience, as\r\nnarrated by a correspondent of the Chicago _Tribune_, explains her\r\nfitness for her mission, while it incidentally throws some light on\r\nthe secrets of the tea-company business:\r\n\r\n\"Previous to the outbreak of our civil war Miss King was\r\nextensively engaged in utilizing the leaves of the great blackberry\r\nand raspberry crops running to waste in the rich lowlands of\r\nGeorgia and Alabama, and kept in that fertile region a large levy\r\nof Northern women--smart, like herself--to superintend the\r\ngathering of the leaves and their preparation for shipment to\r\nheadquarters in New York. These leaves were prepared for the market\r\nat their manipulating halls in one of the narrow streets on the\r\nHudson side of New York city. Over this stage of the tea\r\npreparations Miss King had special supervision, and, by a generous\r\nuse of the genuine imported teas, worked up our American\r\nproductions into all the accredited varieties of the black and\r\ngreen teas of commerce. Here the female supervision apparently\r\nended. In their extensive tea ware-rooms in Walker street the\r\nbusiness was conducted by the shrewdest representatives of\r\nGothamite trade, with all the appliances of the great Chinese\r\ntea-importing houses. Here were huge piles of tea-chests, assorted\r\nand unassorted, and the high-salaried tea-taster with his row of\r\ntiny cups of hot-drawn tea, delicately sampling and classifying the\r\nvarieties and grades for market. The breaking out of the war\r\nstopped the Southern supplies and sent Miss King's female agents to\r\ntheir Northern homes. But the business was made to conform to the\r\nnew order of things. Large cargoes of imported black teas were\r\nbought as they arrived and were skillfully manipulated into those\r\nhigh-cost varieties of green teas so extensively purchased by the\r\ngovernment for its commissary and medical departments.\"\r\n\r\n[231] Mrs. Lozier presided. Addresses were made by Matilda Fletcher\r\nof Iowa, Mrs. Helen Slocum and Mrs. Devereux Blake.\r\n\r\n[232] In Poughkeepsie, Yonkers, Harlem, Williamsburgh, Brighton,\r\nand in several districts in the city of New York.\r\n\r\n[233] Matilda Joslyn Gage, Helen M.

Miss King and Miss\r\nHelen Potter, the distinguished reader, then residing with Miss\r\nKing, assisted in raising a banner for Cornell and Foster,\r\napplauded by the multitude of by-standers.\r\n\r\n[237] Mrs. Lucy A. Brand, principal of the Genesee school of this\r\ncity, a woman with abilities as good as those of any male\r\nprincipal, but who, because she is a woman, receives $550 less\r\nsalary a year than a male principal, was the first woman in the\r\nState of New York to cast a vote under the new school law. On\r\nSaturday afternoon she was at a friend's house, when the _Journal_\r\nwas thrown in, containing the first editorial notice of the passage\r\nof the law. Mrs. Brand saw the welcome announcement. \"Let us go and\r\nregister,\" she at once said, her heart swelling with joy and\r\nthankfulness that even this small quantity of justice had been done\r\nwoman. \"Where is my shawl? I feel as if I should die if I don't get\r\nthere,\" for the hour was late, and the time for closing the\r\nregistry lists was near at hand. To have lost this opportunity\r\nwould have placed her in the position of a second Tantalus, the cup\r\nwithdrawn just as it touched her lips. But she was in time, and the\r\nimportant act of registering accomplished, she had but to possess\r\nher soul in patience until the following Tuesday. Who shall say how\r\nlong the two intervening days were to her; but Tuesday morning at\r\nlast arrived, when, for the first time, Mrs. Brand was to exercise\r\nthe freeman's right of self-government. A gentleman, the owner of\r\nthe block in which she resided, offered to accompany her to the\r\npolls, although he was a Democrat and knew Mrs. Brand would vote\r\nthe Republican ticket. Although not hesitating to go alone, Mrs.\r\nBrand accepted this courtesy. As she entered the polling place the\r\nmen present fell back in a semi-circle. Not a sound was heard, not\r\na whisper, not a breath. In silence and with a joyous solemnity\r\nwell befitting the occasion, Mrs. Brand cast her first vote, at\r\nfive minutes past eight in the morning. The post-master of the\r\ncity, Mr. Chase, offered his congratulations. A few ordinary\r\nremarks were exchanged, and then Mrs. Brand left the place. And\r\nthat was all; neither more nor less. No opposition, no rudeness, no\r\njostling crowd of men, but such behavior as is seen when Christians\r\ncome together at the sacrament. I have long known Mrs. Brand as a\r\nnoble woman, but talking with her a few days since I could but\r\nnotice the added sense of self-respecting dignity that freedom\r\ngives. \"I feel a constant gratitude that even some portion of my\r\nrights have been recognized,\" said she, and I left her, more than\r\never impressed, if that is possible, with the beauty and sacredness\r\nof freedom.--[M.

Russell's reelection as\r\nattorney-general. His official acts prove him the unscrupulous foe\r\nof your liberties. By informing the legislature that you have no\r\nright to vote at common law, he has denied your sacred rights and\r\nmisrepresented the law to your hurt. By stating that you have no\r\nnatural right to vote, he has denied your title to freedom and\r\nsought to keep your rights at the mercy of those in power. By\r\ninforming the legislature that the bill to repeal the statutes\r\nwhich keep you from voting was unconstitutional he misled the\r\nlegislature and kept you disfranchised. By thus continuing your\r\ndisfranchisement, he has subjected you to many misfortunes and\r\nwrongs which the repeal of your disfranchisement would cure, and is\r\npersonally responsible for these sufferings. He has also sought to\r\nrob the mothers of this State of their votes at school elections,\r\nand thus to deprive them of the power to control their children's\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n[Signed:] Clemence S.

Russell, the present attorney-general. When the legislature last\r\nyear was about to repeal the election laws which prevent women from\r\nexercising the right of suffrage, Leslie W. Russell stated to that\r\nbody that women had no right at common law to vote, and that this\r\nbill was unconstitutional. By these misstatements he misled the\r\nlegislature, defeated this most righteous bill and prolonged the\r\ndisfranchisement of women. Thus he inflicted on a majority of our\r\nadult citizens, who had committed no offense, the penalty of\r\ndisfranchisement and the great mischiefs which flow thence, and,\r\nlike Judge Taney in the Dred-Scott decision, perverted law and\r\nconstitution to justify injustice and continue wrong. A vote for\r\nLeslie W. Russell is a vote to keep these women disfranchised and\r\nto prolong these mischiefs. He who thus blocks the way of freedom\r\nshould be removed from the place which enables him to do this. You\r\ncan vote at this election for fifteen or more officers. It is but a\r\nsmall thing to ask, that each of you cast one-fifteenth part of his\r\nvote to represent women's interest at the polls.\r\n\r\n[Signed:] Clemence S. Lozier, M.

The answer to this question may\r\nbe found in an able digest of the old common laws and the Revised\r\nStatutes of Pennsylvania,[255] prepared by Carrie S. Burnham[256]\r\nof Pennsylvania. A careful perusal of this paper will show the\r\nrelative position of man and woman to be that of sovereign and\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nTo get at the real sentiments of a people in regard to the true\r\nstatus of woman we must read the canon and civil laws that form the\r\nbasic principles of their religion and government. We must not\r\ntrust to the feelings and actions of the best men towards the\r\nindividual women whom they may chance to love and respect. The\r\nchivalry and courtesy that the few command through their beauty,\r\nwealth and position, are one thing; but justice, equality, liberty\r\nfor the multitude, are quite another. And when the few, through\r\nmisfortune, are made to feel the iron teeth of the law, they regret\r\nthat they had not used their power to secure permanent protection\r\nunder just laws, rather than to have trusted the transient favors\r\nof individuals to shield them in life's emergencies.\r\n\r\nThe law securing to married women the right to property,[257]\r\ninherited by will or bequest, passed the legislature of\r\nPennsylvania, and was approved by the governor April 11, 1848, just\r\nfive days after a similar law had been passed in New York. Judge\r\nBovier was the mover for the Pennsylvania Married Women's Property\r\nLaw. His feelings had been so often outraged with the misery caused\r\nby men marrying women for their property, that he was bound the law\r\nshould be repealed. He prevailed on several young Quakers who had\r\nrich sisters, to run for the legislature. They were elected and did\r\ntheir duty. Judge Bovier was a descendent of the Waldenses, a\r\nsociety of French Quakers who fled to the mountains from\r\npersecution. Their descendants are still living in France.[258]\r\n\r\nThe disabilities and degradation that women suffer to-day grow out\r\nof the spirit of laws that date from a time when women were viewed\r\nin the light of beasts of burden. Scarce a century has passed since\r\nwomen were sold in this country with cattle. In the _Pennsylvania\r\nGazette_ for January 7, 1768, is the following advertisement:\r\n\r\n     TO BE SEEN.--At the Crooked Billet, near the Court-house,\r\n     Philadelphia (Price Three Pence), A Two Year Old Hogg, 12 Hands\r\n     high, and in length 16 Feet; thought to be the largest of its\r\n     Kind ever seen in America.\r\n\r\nIn the same paper of the following week occurs this yet more\r\nextraordinary announcement:\r\n\r\n     TO BE SOLD.--A Healthy Young Dutch Woman, fit for town or country\r\n     business; about 18 years old; can spin well; she speaks good\r\n     English, and has about five years to serve. Inquire at James Der\r\n     Kinderen's, Strawberry alley.\r\n\r\nIn one century of growth a woman's sewing machine was better\r\nprotected than the woman herself under the old common law:\r\n\r\n     AN ACT _to exempt Sewing Machines belonging to Seamstresses in\r\n     this Commonwealth from levy and sale on execution or distress for\r\n     rent_:\r\n\r\n     SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of\r\n     Representatives of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania in general\r\n     assembly met, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the\r\n     same, That hereafter all sewing machines belonging to\r\n     seamstresses in this commonwealth shall be exempt from levy and\r\n     sale on execution or distress for rent, in addition to any\r\n     article or money now exempt by law. Approved, April 17, 1869.\r\n\r\nWhile the following order reflects the spirit of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, the comments show the dawning of the right idea, and are\r\nworthy the time in which the great State of Pennsylvania could\r\nboast such women as Lucretia Mott, Anna E. Dickinson, Jane G.\r\nSwisshelm and Sarah J. Hale:\r\n\r\n     A WOMAN ORDER IN PITTSBURGH.--The mayor of Pittsburgh has ordered\r\n     the arrest of every woman found on the streets alone after 9\r\n     o'clock in the evening; the consequence of which has been that\r\n     some respectable ladies have recently seen the inside of the\r\n     lock-up.--_Exchange, June, 1869._\r\n\r\n     Now let the mothers, wives and daughters of Pittsburgh obtain the\r\n     passage, by the city council, of an ordinance causing the arrest\r\n     of every _man_ found in the streets after 9 o'clock in the\r\n     evening, and the law will then be equal in its operation. This\r\n     legislating upon the behavior of one sex by the other\r\n     exclusively, is one-sided and despotic. Give both sexes a chance\r\n     at reforming each other.\r\n\r\nAnother step in progress was indicated by the assumption of some\r\nwomen to influence civil administration, not only for their own\r\nprotection, but for that of their sires and sons:\r\n\r\n     An exchange says that women are becoming perfect nuisances, and\r\n     to substantiate the assertion adds that 1,500 women in Chester\r\n     county, Pennsylvania, have petitioned the court to grant no more\r\n     liquor licenses.\r\n\r\nSuppose wives should come reeling home, night after night, with\r\ncurses on their lips, to destroy the food, the dishes, the\r\nfurniture for which husbands toiled; to abuse trembling children,\r\nmaking the home, from year to year, a pandemonium on earth--would\r\nthe good men properly be called \"nuisances,\" who should rise up and\r\nsay this must end; we must protect our firesides, our children,\r\nourselves, society at large? To have women even suggest such\r\nbeneficent laws for the men of their families is called \"a\r\nnuisance,\" while the whole barbarous code for women was declared by\r\nLord Coke to be the \"perfection of reason.\"\r\n\r\nThe prejudice against sex has been as bitter and unreasonable as\r\nagainst color, and far more reprehensible, because in too many\r\ncases it has been a contest between the inferior, with law on his\r\nside, and the superior, with law and custom against her, as the\r\nfollowing facts in the _Sunday Dispatch_, by Anne E. McDowell,\r\nfully show:\r\n\r\n     The decision of the Court of Common Pleas in the case of Mrs.\r\n     McManus, elected principal of the Mount Vernon Boys' Grammar\r\n     School, is to the effect that, no rule being in existence\r\n     prohibiting the exercise of the duties of such office by a woman,\r\n     the resolution of the controllers against the exercise of the\r\n     duties of that office by the lady was unjustifiable and illegal.\r\n     Since the decision was pronounced the controllers have come up to\r\n     the boundary of the principle held by the court, and a rule has\r\n     been proposed that in future women shall be ineligible to be\r\n     principals of boys' grammar schools--the case of Mrs. McManus\r\n     being specially excepted. That lady, therefore, will be\r\n     undisturbed. But she may be, like the celebrated \"Lady\r\n     Freemason.\" an exception to her sex. The controllers have not\r\n     favored the public with their reasons for opposition to the\r\n     employment of females in the higher positions of teaching. Women\r\n     are good enough for inferior service about a boys'\r\n     grammar-school, it seems, but they are not capable of\r\n     superintending it. They may be, and are, teachers in all the\r\n     classes in such schools, even to the highest; but when the\r\n     question arises whether a woman, perfectly competent, shall be\r\n     superintendent of all the classes--for a principal is little\r\n     more--the controllers say _no_. If this action is influenced by a\r\n     belief that women cannot control a school of boys, we hope that\r\n     the experience in the case of Mrs. McManus will dispel the\r\n     illusion, and the public can afford to await the result of the\r\n     trial. But if it is caused by a regard to tradition or precedent,\r\n     or because there never has yet been an instance of a woman being\r\n     a principal of a boys' grammar-school before this case of Mrs.\r\n     McManus, we hope that the controllers will soon see the error of\r\n     their course. The complaints from the sections are to the effect\r\n     that it is very difficult to get a competent male teacher to\r\n     remain principal of a boys' grammar-school for any length of\r\n     time. The salary attached to that position is inadequate,\r\n     according to the increased cost of living of the times. Gentlemen\r\n     who are competent to act as principals of the public schools find\r\n     that they can make more money by establishing private schools;\r\n     and hence they are uneasy and dissatisfied while in the public\r\n     service. A woman able to take charge of a boys' grammar-school\r\n     will be paid a more liberal salary (such is the injustice of our\r\n     social system in relation to female labor) in that position than\r\n     in any other connected with education that she can command, and\r\n     she will therefore be likely to be better satisfied with the\r\n     duties and to perform them more properly. That such advantage\r\n     ought to be held out to ladies competent to be teachers of the\r\n     highest grade, we firmly believe. The field of female avocations\r\n     should be extended in every legitimate direction; and it seems to\r\n     us, unless some reason can be given for the exception, which has\r\n     not yet been presented in the case of Mrs. McManus, that the\r\n     principalships of the boys' grammar-schools ought to be\r\n     accessible to ladies of the proper character and qualification,\r\n     without the imputation that by reason of their sex they must\r\n     necessarily be unfitted for such duties.\r\n\r\nIn preparing themselves for the medical profession, for which the\r\nmost conservative people now admit that women are peculiarly\r\nadapted, students have encountered years of opposition, ridicule\r\nand persecution. After a college for women was established in\r\nPhiladelphia,[259] there was another long struggle before their\r\nright to attend the clinics in the hospitals was accorded. The\r\nfaculty and students alike protested against the admission of women\r\ninto mixed classes; but as there was no provision to give them the\r\nclinics alone, a protest against mixed classes was a protest\r\nagainst such advantages to women altogether. One would have\r\nsupposed the men might have left the delicacy of the question to\r\nthe decision of the women themselves. But in this struggle for\r\neducation men have always been more concerned about the loss of\r\nmodesty than the acquirement of knowledge and wisdom. From the\r\nopinions usually expressed by these self-constituted guardians of\r\nthe feminine character, we might be led to infer that the virtues\r\nof women were not a part of the essential elements of their\r\norganization, but a sort of temporary scaffolding, erected by\r\nsociety to shield a naturally weak structure that any wind could\r\nreadily demolish.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting convened November 15 at the University of\r\nPennsylvania, to consider the subject of clinical instruction to\r\nmixed classes the following remonstrance was unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n     The undersigned, professors in the University of Pennsylvania,\r\n     professors in Jefferson Medical College, members of the medical\r\n     staff of various hospitals of Philadelphia, and members of the\r\n     medical profession in Philadelphia at large, out of respect for\r\n     their profession, and for the interests of the public, do feel it\r\n     to be their duty, at the present time, to express their\r\n     convictions upon the subject of \"clinical instruction to _mixed\r\n     classes_ of male and female students of medicine.\" They are\r\n     induced to present their views on this question, which is of so\r\n     grave importance to medical education, from the fact that it is\r\n     misunderstood by the public, and because an attempt is now being\r\n     made to force it before the community in a shape which they\r\n     conceive to be injurious to the progress of medical science, and\r\n     to the efficiency of clinical teaching. They have no hesitation\r\n     in declaring that their deliberate conviction is adverse to\r\n     conducting clinical instruction in the presence of students of\r\n     _both sexes_. The judgment that has been arrived at is based upon\r\n     the following considerations:\r\n\r\n     I. Clinical instruction in practical medicine demands an\r\n     examination of all the organs and parts of the body, as far as\r\n     practicable; hence, personal exposure becomes for this purpose\r\n     often a matter of absolute necessity. It cannot be assumed, by\r\n     any right-minded person, that male patients should be subjected\r\n     to inspection before a class of females, although this inspection\r\n     may, without impropriety, be submitted to before those of their\r\n     own sex. A thorough investigation, as well as demonstration, in\r\n     these cases--so necessary to render instruction complete and\r\n     effective--is, by a mixed audience, precluded; while the clinical\r\n     lecturer is restrained and embarrassed in his inquiries, and must\r\n     therefore fall short in the conclusions which he may draw, and in\r\n     the instruction which he communicates.\r\n\r\n     II. In many operations upon male patients exposure of the body is\r\n     inevitable, and demonstrations must be made which are unfitted\r\n     for the observation of students of the opposite sex. These\r\n     expositions, when made under the eye of such a conjoined\r\n     assemblage, are shocking to the sense of decency, and entail the\r\n     risk of unmanning the surgeon--of distracting his mind, and\r\n     endangering the life of his patient. Besides this, a large class\r\n     of surgical diseases of the male is of so delicate a nature as\r\n     altogether to forbid inspection by female students. Yet a\r\n     complete understanding of this particular class of diseases is of\r\n     preeminent importance to the community. Moreover, such affections\r\n     can be thoroughly studied only in the clinics of the large\r\n     cities, and the opportunity for studying them, so far from being\r\n     curtailed, should be extended to the utmost possible degree. To\r\n     those who are familiar with such cases as are here alluded to, it\r\n     is inconceivable that females should ever be called to their\r\n     treatment.\r\n\r\n     III. By the joint participation, on the part of male and female\r\n     students, in the instruction and in the demonstrations which\r\n     properly belong to the clinical lecture-room, the barrier of\r\n     respect is broken down, and that high estimation of womanly\r\n     qualities, which should always be sustained and cherished, and\r\n     which has its origin in domestic and social associations, is\r\n     lost, by an inevitable and positive demoralization of the\r\n     individuals concerned, thereby entailing most serious detriment\r\n     to the morals of society. In view of the above considerations,\r\n     the undersigned[260] do earnestly and solemnly protest against\r\n     the admixture of the sexes at clinical instruction in medicine\r\n     and surgery, and do respectfully lay these their views before the\r\n     board of managers of the hospitals in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n     _November 15, 1869._\r\n\r\nAt meetings held at the University and Jefferson Medical Colleges,\r\nby the students, on Wednesday evening, the following preambles and\r\nresolutions were adopted:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The managers of the Pennsylvania Hospital have seen fit\r\n     to admit female students to the clinics of that establishment,\r\n     thereby excluding from the lectures many cases, medical and\r\n     surgical; and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, We consider that in our purchase of tickets of admission\r\n     there was a tacit agreement that we should have the benefit of\r\n     all cases which the medical and surgical staff of that hospital\r\n     should deem fit for our instruction:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That a respectful request be made to the managers of\r\n     the Pennsylvania Hospital that we be informed as to whether the\r\n     usual character of the clinics will be changed.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That pending the action of the managers on this\r\n     question, we as a class and individually absent ourselves from\r\n     the clinical lectures. And\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The levity of a few thoughtless young men in the\r\n     presence of the females at the hospital has caused the journals\r\n     of this city to assume that the whole class of medical students\r\n     are utterly devoid of all the attributes of gentlemen,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That while we do not by any means concede that the\r\n     published accounts of the affair are correct, we deplore the fact\r\n     that _any_ demonstration should have taken place; for although\r\n     the female students may be considered by their presence at the\r\n     hospital where male students are present, to have cast aside that\r\n     delicacy and modesty which constitutes the aegis of their sex,\r\n     they are women, and as such demand our forbearance, if not our\r\n     respect.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That these preambles and resolutions be published in\r\n     some respectable journal of this city.[261]\r\n\r\nOn these remonstrances of the faculty and students, _The Press_,\r\nJohn W. Forney, editor, had many able editorials condemning the\r\naction of the medical fraternity. The leading journals throughout\r\nthe country advocated the right of the women to enjoy the\r\nadvantages of the hospital clinics. _The Press_, November 22, 1869,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     The proceedings of the meeting held by the faculties of our two\r\n     leading medical schools evince the disposition which lurks at the\r\n     bottom of the movement against women as physicians. The hospital\r\n     managers are to be browbeaten into the stand taken by the\r\n     students, and now sanctioned by the professors. If the women are\r\n     to be denied the privilege of clinical lectures, why do not\r\n     learned professors, or students, or both, have the manliness to\r\n     suggest and advocate some means of solving the difficulty so that\r\n     the rights of neither sex shall be impaired? Would any professor\r\n     agree to lecture to the women separately? Would any professor\r\n     favor the admission of women into the female wards of the\r\n     hospitals? Would any professor agree to propose anything, or do\r\n     anything that would weaken the firm stand taken against the\r\n     admission of women to professional privileges? If so, why not do\r\n     it at once? Nothing else will make protestations of fairness\r\n     appear at all genuine. Nothing else will remove the stigma of\r\n     attempting to drag the hospitals into a support of this crusade\r\n     against women. * * * How absurd the solemn declaration, \"it\r\n     cannot be assumed by any right-minded person that male patients\r\n     should be subjected to inspection before a class of females,\r\n     although this inspection may, without impropriety, be submitted\r\n     to before those of their own sex.\" This cuts both ways. If it be\r\n     improper for female students to be present when patients of the\r\n     other sex are treated, is it proper for male students to witness\r\n     the treatment of female patients?\r\n\r\nThe practical good sense shown in the following report of a\r\ncommittee of the Faculty of the Woman's Medical College of\r\nPennsylvania, makes a very favorable contrast with the unreasonable\r\nremonstrances of the so-called superior sex:\r\n\r\n                                   PHILADELPHIA, NOV. 15, 1869.\r\n\r\n     As the relation of students of medicine to public clinics, and\r\n     the views entertained by those entitled to speak for their\r\n     medical education, are now extensively discussed in the public\r\n     journals, it seems necessary for us to state our position.\r\n     Considering it decided that, as practitioners of medicine, the\r\n     guardianship of life and health is to be placed in the keeping of\r\n     women, it becomes the interest of society and the duty of those\r\n     entrusted with their professional training to endeavor to provide\r\n     for them all suitable means for that practical instruction which\r\n     is gained at hospital clinics.\r\n\r\n     The taunt has heretofore been frequently thrown out that ladies\r\n     have not attended the great clinical schools of the country, nor\r\n     listened to its celebrated teachers, and that, consequently, they\r\n     cannot be as well prepared as men for medical practice. We\r\n     believe, as we have always done, that in all special diseases of\r\n     men and women, and in all operations necessarily involving\r\n     embarrassing exposure of person, it is not fitting or expedient\r\n     that students of different sexes should attend promiscuously;\r\n     that all special diseases of men should be treated by men in the\r\n     presence of men only, and those of women, where it is\r\n     practicable, by women in the presence of women only. It was this\r\n     feeling, founded on the respect due to the delicacy of women as\r\n     patients, perhaps more than any other consideration, which led to\r\n     the founding of the Women's Hospital in Philadelphia. There the\r\n     clinical demonstration of special diseases is made by and before\r\n     women alone. As we would not permit men to enter these clinics,\r\n     neither would we be willing--out of regard to the feelings of men\r\n     as patients, if for no other considerations--that our students\r\n     should attend clinics where men are specially treated, and there\r\n     has been no time in the history of our college when our students\r\n     could intentionally do so, save in direct contravention of our\r\n     known views. In nearly all the great public hospitals, however,\r\n     by far the larger proportion of cases suited for clinical\r\n     illustration--whether medical or surgical--is of those which\r\n     involve no necessary exposure, and are the results of diseases\r\n     and accidents to which man and woman are subject alike, and which\r\n     women are constantly called upon to treat. Into these clinics,\r\n     women also--often sensitive and shrinking, albeit poor--are\r\n     brought as patients to illustrate the lectures, and we maintain\r\n     that wherever it is proper to introduce women as patients, there\r\n     also is it but just and in accordance with the instincts of the\r\n     truest womanhood for women to appear as physicians and students.\r\n\r\n     We had arranged when our class was admitted to the Pennsylvania\r\n     hospital to attend on alternate clinic days only, so as to allow\r\n     ample opportunity for the unembarrassed exhibition of special\r\n     cases to the other students by themselves. We encouraged our\r\n     students to visit the hospital upon this view, sustained by our\r\n     confidence in the sound judgment and high-minded courtesy of the\r\n     medical gentlemen in charge of the wards. All the objections that\r\n     have been made to our students' admission to these clinics seem\r\n     to be based upon the mistaken assumption that they had designed\r\n     to attend them indiscriminately. As we state distinctly and\r\n     unequivocally that this was not the fact, that they had no idea\r\n     or intention of being present except on one day of the week, and\r\n     when no cases which it would not be proper to illustrate before\r\n     both classes of students would necessarily be brought in--it\r\n     seems to us that all these objections are destroyed, and we\r\n     cannot but feel that those fair-minded professional gentlemen,\r\n     who, under this false impression as to facts, have objected to\r\n     our course, will, upon a candid reconsideration, acknowledge that\r\n     our position is just and intrinsically right. The general\r\n     testimony of those who attended the Saturday clinics last winter\r\n     at the Philadelphia Hospital at Blockley, when about forty ladies\r\n     made regular visits, was that the tone and bearing of the\r\n     students were greatly improved, while the usual cases were\r\n     brought forward and the full measure of instruction given without\r\n     any violation of refined propriety.\r\n\r\n     We maintain, in common with all medical men, that science is\r\n     impersonal, and that the high aim of relief to suffering humanity\r\n     sanctifies all duties: and we repel, as derogatory to the science\r\n     of medicine, the assertion that the physician who has risen to\r\n     the level of his high calling need be embarrassed, in treating\r\n     general diseases, by the presence of earnest women. The movement\r\n     for woman's medical education has been sustained from the\r\n     beginning by the most refined, intelligent, and religious women,\r\n     and by the noblest and best men in the community. It has ever\r\n     been regarded by these as the cause of humanity, calculated in\r\n     its very nature to enlarge professional experience, bless women,\r\n     and refine society. It has in our own city caused a college and a\r\n     hospital not only to be founded, but to be sustained and endowed\r\n     by those who have known intimately the character and objects of\r\n     this work, and the aims and efforts of those connected with it.\r\n     It has this year brought to this city some fifty educated and\r\n     earnest women to study medicine, women who have come to this\r\n     labor enthusiastically but reverently, as to a great\r\n     life-interest and a holy calling. These ladies purchased tickets,\r\n     and entered the clinic of the Pennsylvania Hospital, with no\r\n     obtrusive spirit, and with no intention of interfering with the\r\n     legitimate advantages of other students. If they have been forced\r\n     into an unwelcome notoriety, it has not been of their own\r\n     seeking.\r\n\r\n                                            ANN PRESTON, M. D., _Dean_.\r\n\r\n     EMELINE H. CLEVELAND, M. D., _Secretary_.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to James Truman, D. D. S., of the Pennsylvania\r\nCollege of Dental Surgery, for the following account of the\r\nadmission of women into that branch of the medical profession:\r\n\r\n     The general agitation of the question: What are women best\r\n     qualified for in the struggle for existence? naturally led\r\n     liberal minds to the opening of new avenues for the employment of\r\n     their talents, shared equally with men. Her right to practice in\r\n     medicine had been conceded after a long and severe conflict. Even\r\n     the domain of the theologian had been invaded, but law and\r\n     dentistry were as yet closed, and in the case of the latter,\r\n     unthought of as an appropriate avocation for women. The subject,\r\n     however, seemed so important, presenting a field of labor\r\n     peculiarly suited to her, that one gentleman, then professor in\r\n     the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery, felt it his duty to\r\n     call public attention to this promising work. In a valedictory\r\n     delivered by him to the class of 1866, at Musical Fund Hall of\r\n     Philadelphia, he included in his theme the peculiar fitness of\r\n     dentistry for women. The question was briefly stated, but it\r\n     rather startled the large audience by its novelty, and the effect\r\n     was no less surprising on the faculty, board of trustees and\r\n     professional gentlemen on the platform.\r\n\r\n     In the fall of 1868 the dean of the Pennsylvania College of\r\n     Dental Surgery was waited upon by a German gentleman, who desired\r\n     to introduce a lady who had come to this country with the\r\n     expectation that all colleges were open to women. Although\r\n     informed that this was not the case, he still entertained the\r\n     hope that she might be admitted as a student of dentistry. She\r\n     gave her name as Henrietti Hirschfeld, of Berlin. The matter came\r\n     up before the faculty, and after a free discussion of the whole\r\n     subject, she was rejected by a majority vote, but two voting in\r\n     her favor.\r\n\r\n     In a subsequent interview with Professor Truman, he learned that\r\n     she had left her native land with the full assurance that she\r\n     would have no difficulty in \"free America\" in securing a dental\r\n     education. She had also the positive sanction of her government,\r\n     through the then minister of instruction, Dr. Falk, that on\r\n     condition of receiving an American diploma she would be permitted\r\n     to practice on her return. Her distress, therefore, at this\r\n     initial failure was, naturally, very great. The excitement that\r\n     this application made was intensified when it was rumored among\r\n     the students that a woman desired to be matriculated. The\r\n     opposition became very bitter, and manifested itself in many\r\n     petty annoyances. In the course of a day or two one gentleman of\r\n     the faculty, and he the dean, concluded to change his vote, and\r\n     as this decided the question, she was admitted. The opposition of\r\n     the professor of anatomy, who belonged to the old school of\r\n     medical teachers, was so manifest that it was deemed advisable to\r\n     have her take anatomy in the Woman's Medical College for that\r\n     winter. The first year of this was in every way satisfactory.\r\n     Although the students received her and Mrs. Truman, who\r\n     accompanied her on the first visit, with a storm of hisses, they\r\n     gradually learned not only to treat her with respect, but she\r\n     became a favorite with all, and while not convinced as to the\r\n     propriety of women in dentistry, they all agreed that Mrs.\r\n     Hirschfeld might do as an exception. The last year she was\r\n     permitted by the irate professor of anatomy, Dr. Forbes, to take\r\n     that subject under him.\r\n\r\n     She graduated with honor, and returned to Berlin to practice her\r\n     profession. This was regarded as an exceptional case, and by no\r\n     means settled the status of the college in regard to women. The\r\n     conservative element was exceedingly bitter, and it was very\r\n     evident that a long time must elapse before another woman could\r\n     be admitted. The great stir made by Mrs. Hirschfeld's graduation\r\n     brought several other applications from ladies of Germany, but\r\n     these were without hesitation denied. Failing to convince his\r\n     colleagues of the injustice of their action, Dr. Truman tried to\r\n     secure more favorable results from other colleges, and applied\r\n     personally to Dr. Gorgas of the Baltimore College of Dental\r\n     Surgery. The answer was favorable, and he accompanied the\r\n     applicant and entered her in that institution. This furnished\r\n     accommodation for the few applicants. The loss in money began to\r\n     tell on the pockets, if not the consciences, of the faculty of\r\n     the Philadelphia school. They saw the stream had flown in another\r\n     direction, swelling the coffers of another institution, when,\r\n     without an effort, they could have retained the whole. They\r\n     concluded to try the experiment again, and accepted three ladies\r\n     in 1872 and 1873--Miss Annie D. Ramborger of Philadelphia,\r\n     Fraulein Veleske Wilcke and Dr. Jacoby of Germany. Their first\r\n     year was very satisfactory, but at its close it was very evident\r\n     that there was a determination on the part of the minority of the\r\n     class to spare no effort to effect their removal from the school.\r\n     A petition was forwarded to the faculty to this effect, and\r\n     although one was presented by the majority of the students in\r\n     their favor, the faculty chose to accept the former as\r\n     representing public sentiment, and it was decided not to allow\r\n     them to take another year at this college. This outrage was not\r\n     accomplished without forcible protest from the gentleman\r\n     previously named, and he appealed from this decision to the\r\n     governing power, the board of trustees.[262] To hear this appeal\r\n     a special meeting was called for March 27, 1873, at which the\r\n     communication of Professor Truman was read and ordered filed. A\r\n     similar communication, in opposition, was received, signed by\r\n     Professors T. L. Buckingham, E. Wildman, George T. Barker, James\r\n     Tyson and J. Ewing Mears. The matter was referred to a committee\r\n     consisting of Hon. Henry C. Carey, W. S. Pierce and G. R.\r\n     Morehouse, M. D. At a special meeting convened for this purpose,\r\n     March 31, 1873, this committee made their report. They say:\r\n\r\n          Three ladies entered as students of this college at the\r\n          commencement of the session, 1872-73, paid their\r\n          matriculation fees, attended the course of lectures, and\r\n          were informed, by a resolution adopted by a majority of the\r\n          faculty at the close of the session, that they would not be\r\n          permitted to attend the second course of lectures. No other\r\n          cause was assigned for the action of the faculty than that\r\n          they deemed it against the interest of the college to permit\r\n          them to do so, on account of the dissatisfaction which it\r\n          gave to certain male students, etc. * * * The goal to which\r\n          all medical and dental students look, is graduation and the\r\n          diploma, which is to be the evidence of their qualification\r\n          to practice their art. To qualify themselves for this they\r\n          bestow their time, their money and their labor. To deprive\r\n          them of this without just cause is to disappoint their\r\n          hopes, and to receive from them money and bestowal of time\r\n          and labor without the full equivalent which they had a right\r\n          to expect.\r\n\r\n     After discussing at length the legal aspects of the case, the\r\n     summing up is as follows:\r\n\r\n          We, therefore, respectfully report that in our opinion it is\r\n          the legal right of these ladies to attend, and it is the\r\n          legal duty of this college to give them, as students, a\r\n          second course of lectures on the terms of the announcement\r\n          which forms the basis of the contract with them.\r\n\r\n     This report was signed by all the committee, and read by W. S.\r\n     Pierce, one of the number, and judge of the Court of Common Pleas\r\n     of Philadelphia. It carried with it, therefore, all the force of\r\n     a judicial decision, and was so accepted by the board, and\r\n     adopted at once. This left the majority of the faculty no choice\r\n     but to accept the decision as final as far as these ladies were\r\n     concerned. This they did, and the three were invited to resume\r\n     their studies. Two, Misses Ramborger and Wilcke, accepted, Miss\r\n     Jacoby refused and went to Baltimore.\r\n\r\n     The most interesting feature of this matter, and that which\r\n     clearly demonstrated a marked advance in public opinion, was the\r\n     stir it made in the press. The daily and Sunday papers bristled\r\n     with strong leaders, the faculty being denounced in no measured\r\n     terms for their action. To such an extent was this carried, and\r\n     so overwhelming was the indignation, that it practically settled\r\n     the question for Philadelphia, although several years elapsed\r\n     after these ladies were graduated before others were accepted.\r\n     When that time did arrive, under the present dean, Dr. C. N.\r\n     Pierce, they were accorded everything, without any reservation,\r\n     and the school has continued ever since to accept them. At the\r\n     meeting of the National Association of Dentists, held at\r\n     Saratoga, 1869, Dr. Truman introduced a resolution looking to the\r\n     recognition of women in the profession. The resolution and the\r\n     remarks were kindly received, but were, of course, laid on the\r\n     table. This was expected, the object being to make the thought\r\n     familiar in every section of the country.\r\n\r\n     These efforts have borne rich fruit, and now women are being\r\n     educated at a majority of the prominent dental colleges, and no\r\n     complaints are heard of coeducation in this department of work.\r\n     The college that first accepted and then rejected--the\r\n     Pennsylvania of Philadelphia--has a yearly average of seven to\r\n     eight women, nearly equally divided between America and Germany.\r\n     Of the three dental schools in Philadelphia, two accept women,\r\n     and the third--the Dental Department of the University of\r\n     Pennsylvania--would, if the faculty were not overruled by the\r\n     governing powers.\r\n\r\n     The learned theories that were promulgated in regard to the\r\n     injury the practice of dentistry would be to women, have all\r\n     fallen to the ground. The advocates of women in dentistry were\r\n     met at the outstart with the health question, and as it had never\r\n     been tested, the most favorably inclined looked forward with some\r\n     anxiety to the result. Fifteen years have elapsed since then, and\r\n     almost every town in Germany is supplied with a woman in this\r\n     profession. Many are also established in America. These have all\r\n     the usual requisites of bodily strength, and the writer has yet\r\n     to learn of a single failure from physical deterioration.\r\n\r\n     The first lady, Miss Lucy B. Hobbs, to graduate in dentistry, was\r\n     sent out from the Cincinnati College, and she, I believe, is\r\n     still in active practice in Kansas. She graduated in 1866. Mrs.\r\n     Hirschfeld, before spoken of, returned to Germany and became at\r\n     once a subject for the fun of the comic papers, and for the more\r\n     serious work of the _Bajan_ and _Uberlana und Meer_, both of them\r\n     containing elaborate and illustrated notices of her. She had some\r\n     friends in the higher walks of life; notable amongst these was\r\n     President Lette of the _Trauen-Verein_, whose aid and powerful\r\n     influence had assisted her materially in the early stages of her\r\n     effort. The result of these combined forces soon placed her in\r\n     possession of a large practice. She was patronized by ladies in\r\n     the highest circles, including the crown princess. She\r\n     subsequently married, had two boys to rear and educate, and a\r\n     large household to supervise. She has assisted several of her\r\n     relatives into professions, two in medicine and two in dentistry,\r\n     besides aiding many worthy persons. She has established a clinic\r\n     for women in Berlin, something very badly needed there. This is\r\n     in charge of two physicians, one being her husband's sister, Dr.\r\n     Fanny Tiburtius. She has also started a hospital for women.\r\n     These are mainly supported by her individual exertions.\r\n     Notwithstanding all these multifarious and trying duties, she\r\n     practices daily, and is as well physically and mentally as when\r\n     she commenced. Fraulein Valeske Wilcke of Koenigsberg has been\r\n     over twelve years in a very large practice with no evil results;\r\n     Miss Annie D. Ramborger, an equal time, with an equally large\r\n     practice, and enjoys apparently far better health than most\r\n     ladies of thirty.\r\n\r\n     Dentistry is, probably, one of the most trying professions, very\r\n     few men being equal to the severe strain, and many are obliged to\r\n     succumb. No woman has as yet failed, though it would not be at\r\n     all remarkable if such were the case. The probabilities are that\r\n     comparatively few will choose it as a profession, but that\r\n     another door has been opened for employment is a cause for\r\n     congratulation with all right-thinking minds.\r\n\r\nFor opening this profession to women a debt of gratitude is due to\r\nDr. Truman from all his countrywomen, as well as to those noble\r\nGerman students, who have so ably filled the positions he secured\r\nfor them. Similar struggles, both in medicine and dentistry, were\r\nencountered in other States, but the result was as it must be in\r\nevery case, the final triumph of justice for women. Already they\r\nare in most of the colleges and hospitals, and members of many of\r\nthe State and National associations.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, the Society of Friends founded Swarthmore College[263] for\r\nthe education of both sexes, erecting a fine building in a\r\nbeautiful locality. At the dedication of this institution, Lucretia\r\nMott was elected to honorary membership and invited to the\r\nplatform. With her own hands she planted the first tree, which now\r\nadorns those spacious grounds.\r\n\r\nThe persecutions that women encountered in every onward step soon\r\ntaught them the necessity of remodeling the laws and customs for\r\nthemselves. They began to see the fallacy of the old ideas, that\r\nmen looked after the interests of women, \"that they were their\r\nnatural protectors,\" that they could safely trust them to legislate\r\non their personal and property rights; for they found in almost\r\nevery case that whatever right and privilege man claimed for\r\nhimself, he proposed exactly the opposite for women. Hence the\r\nnecessity for them to have a voice as to the laws and the rulers\r\nunder which they lived. Whatever reform they attempted they soon\r\nfound their labors valueless, because they had no power to remedy\r\nany evils protected by law. After laboring in temperance,\r\nprison-reform, coeducation, and women's rights in the trades and\r\nprofessions, their hopes all alike centered at last in the suffrage\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, a suffrage association was formed in Philadelphia at a\r\nmeeting of the American Equal Rights Society,[264] held in Franklin\r\nInstitute. This convention was marked by a heated debate on the\r\nduty of the abolitionists now that the black man was emancipated,\r\nto make the demand for the enfranchisement of women, as well as the\r\nfreedmen.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to John K. Wildman of Philadelphia for the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     The Pennsylvania association was organized December 22, 1869, in\r\n     Mercantile Library Hall, Philadelphia. The meeting was called to\r\n     order by John K. Wildman, who said: \"The time has arrived when it\r\n     is necessary for us to take some action towards promoting the\r\n     cause of woman suffrage. We desire to do our part as far as\r\n     practicable, in the work of enlightening the people of our State\r\n     upon this important subject. With this end in view we propose to\r\n     organize, hoping that all friends of the movement will cordially\r\n     give us their influence.\" Edward M. Davis then proposed the\r\n     appointment of Judge William S. Pierce as chairman of the\r\n     meeting. This was agreed to, and Judge Pierce announced that the\r\n     meeting was ready for business, reserving for another stage of\r\n     the proceedings any remarks he might wish to make. Annie Heacock\r\n     was chosen to act as secretary. In accordance with a motion that\r\n     was adopted, the chairman appointed a committee of five\r\n     persons[265] to prepare a constitution, and present the same for\r\n     the action of the meeting. Mary Grew spoke at length in her\r\n     earnest and impressive manner, presenting forcibly those familiar\r\n     yet solid arguments in favor of woman suffrage which form the\r\n     basis of the discussion, and which should irrevocably settle the\r\n     question. Dr. Henry T. Child followed with a brief address,\r\n     showing his zealous interest in the object of the meeting, and\r\n     trusting that at no distant period the ballot would be placed in\r\n     the hands of the women of the land. Judge Pierce said:\r\n\r\n          I am in favor of giving woman a chance in the world. I feel\r\n          very much in regard to woman as Diogenes did when Alexander\r\n          the Great went to see him. When the monarch arrived at the\r\n          city in which Diogenes lived, he sent a request for him to\r\n          come to see him. Diogenes declined to go. The monarch then\r\n          went to the place of his residence, and found him lying in\r\n          his court-yard sunning himself. He did not even rise when\r\n          Alexander approached. Standing over him, the warrior asked,\r\n          \"Diogenes, what can I do for you?\" And the philosopher\r\n          answered, \"Nothing, except to stand out of my sunshine.\"\r\n          Now, I am disposed to stand out of woman's sunshine. If she\r\n          wants the light of the sun upon her, and the breath of\r\n          heaven upon her, and freedom of action necessary to develop\r\n          herself, heaven forbid that I should stand in her way. I\r\n          believe that everything goes to its own place in God's\r\n          world, and woman will go to her place if you do not impede\r\n          her. We should not be afraid to trust her, or to apply the\r\n          same principles to her in regard to suffrage that we apply\r\n          to ourselves. There should be no distinction. Her claims to\r\n          the ballot rest upon a just and logical foundation.\r\n\r\n     The venerable Sojourner Truth spoke a few words of encouragement,\r\n     showing in her humble and fervid way a reverent faith in the\r\n     final triumph of justice. After the adoption of the constitution,\r\n     the organization was completed by the election of officers[266]\r\n     to serve for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n     The first thing that claimed the attention of the officers of the\r\n     new society was the representation of the different counties on\r\n     the executive committee; and for this purpose the chairman wrote\r\n     to nearly all of the sixty-three counties, chiefly to the\r\n     postmasters of the principal towns. The replies that were\r\n     received presented a curious medley of sentiment and opinion\r\n     touching the object in view, disclosing every shade of tone and\r\n     temper between the two extremes of cold indifference and warm\r\n     enthusiasm. It was evident that, in a large number of cases, the\r\n     inquiries promptly found their resting-place in the waste-basket.\r\n     Before the close of the year twenty-two counties were\r\n     represented. Thus reinforced, the committee took immediate steps\r\n     towards distributing documents and circulating petitions\r\n     throughout the State. Many of the county members cooeperated\r\n     earnestly in this work. Some of them, not satisfied to limit\r\n     their action to this particular form of service, aided the\r\n     movement by collecting funds and holding public meetings in their\r\n     respective localities. Matilda Hindman, representing Alleghany\r\n     county, evinced both energy and enterprise in forwarding the\r\n     movement through the agency of public meetings. She did good\r\n     service from the beginning, relying almost solely upon her own\r\n     determined purpose. Her deep interest in the work and its object,\r\n     and the courage that animated her at the first impulse of duty,\r\n     have continued without abatement to the present time. Her\r\n     usefulness and activity have not confined themselves within the\r\n     limits of Pennsylvania, but have extended to other States, both\r\n     in the East and West.\r\n\r\n     Miss Matilda Hindman, of Philadelphia, pays the following tribute\r\n     to her parents:\r\n\r\n          In 1837, my father being a member of the school committee of\r\n          the Union township, Washington county, secured equal\r\n          salaries for women; and in spite of steady opposition, there\r\n          was no difference made for four years. The women who taught\r\n          the schools in the summer were paid the same as the men who\r\n          taught in the winter. At the death of my father the board\r\n          returned to the old system of half pay for women; the result\r\n          was \"incompetent teachers,\" furnishing the opposition with\r\n          just the plea they desired--that women were not fit for\r\n          school teachers. My mother remonstrated, but in vain. They\r\n          replied, \"women never received as much as men for any work\";\r\n          \"it did not cost as much to keep a woman as a man,\" and\r\n          moreover, these school matters belonged to men, and women\r\n          had no right to interfere. In 1842, my mother offered to\r\n          board the teacher in her district, gratis, if the board\r\n          would raise her salary proportionally. They received her\r\n          proposition with scorn. She then refused to pay her taxes.\r\n          Such was the respect for her in the community, and the sense\r\n          of justice in regard to the teachers, that the authorities\r\n          suffered the tax to go unpaid, and at the end of the year\r\n          accepted the proposition, and for many years after, she\r\n          boarded the teacher in her district, making the woman's net\r\n          salary equal to that of the man.\r\n\r\n          My mother lived to see her daughters employed in her\r\n          township on equal salaries with men. But in process of time,\r\n          another board, for the express purpose of humiliating mother\r\n          and daughters alike, passed a resolution to take two dollars\r\n          a month from each of their salaries, when all three\r\n          resigned. They all honored her, by carrying into their\r\n          life-work the noble principles for which she suffered so\r\n          much.\r\n\r\n          She was the grand-daughter of a Scotch-Irish Presbyterian\r\n          minister, who, with his young family, was among the earliest\r\n          settlers in the wilderness of what is now known as the\r\n          prosperous and beautiful county of Washington, Pennsylvania.\r\n          Her name was Sarah Campbell. She was born in 1798. From her\r\n          earliest girlhood she rebelled against the injustice done\r\n          women by the law. She felt acutely the wrong done her and\r\n          her sisters by being denied an education equal to their\r\n          brothers, and denied also an equal share of their\r\n          inheritance. While the father possessed a large estate, and\r\n          provided liberally for his sons, he left his daughters a\r\n          mere pittance.\r\n\r\n     In view of such facts, it is folly to say that women were ever\r\n     satisfied with the humiliating discriminations of sex they have\r\n     endured in all periods, and in all ranks in society.\r\n\r\n     The first annual report of the association was prepared by Eliza\r\n     Sproat Turner. She said:\r\n\r\n          We do not complain that man is slow to realize the injustice\r\n          of his present attitude towards woman--an attitude once,\r\n          from necessity, endurable; now, from too long continuance,\r\n          grown intolerable. It would not be natural for him to feel\r\n          it with equal keenness. It takes a great-minded fox to find\r\n          out, what every goose knows, that foxes' teeth are cruel.\r\n          And while we do not complain of this incapacity on his part,\r\n          the advocates of this cause feel the necessity for woman to\r\n          take upon herself whatever share in the management of their\r\n          mutual affairs shall be needed to right the balance;\r\n          concluding that the defects in legislation which she is, by\r\n          reason of her position, more competent to understand, she\r\n          should be more competent to remedy. Not these innovations\r\n          alone, but others involving matters beyond individual\r\n          interests, she expects to achieve by the power she shall\r\n          gain through the exercise of her right of suffrage. We\r\n          discern, in the consideration of nearly all questions of\r\n          national welfare, a disposition to press unduly the\r\n          interests of trade and commerce rather than the interests of\r\n          the fireside.\r\n\r\n     Mary Grew presided, and has been elected president of the\r\n     association every year from the beginning, performing the duties\r\n     of the position with ability, earnestness and satisfaction. In\r\n     the winter of 1870-71 the executive committee recommended the\r\n     passage of a law that should give married women the control of\r\n     their own earnings. The appeal to the legislature in behalf of\r\n     such a law was renewed the following winter, and its passage\r\n     finally secured. Among the resolutions adopted at the annual\r\n     meeting was the following:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the vote of the legislature of this State\r\n          for a convention to amend the constitution, makes it our\r\n          duty to work for the exclusion of the word \"male\" from the\r\n          provision defining the qualifications for the elective\r\n          franchise, and that we call upon all friends of justice to\r\n          give their best energies to the sustaining of this object.\r\n\r\n     Subsequently the executive committee prepared a petition with\r\n     reference to the formation of the constitutional convention,\r\n     asking the legislature, in making the needful regulations, to\r\n     frame them in such a way as to secure the representation of the\r\n     women of the State. This petition was unavailing. At the next\r\n     annual meeting, which was held at the time the constitutional\r\n     convention was in session, a resolution was adopted containing an\r\n     appeal to that body, earnestly requesting it to present to the\r\n     people of the State a constitution that should secure the right\r\n     of suffrage to its citizens without distinction of sex,\r\n     accompanied by a request for a hearing at such time and place as\r\n     the convention should decide. The request was willingly granted,\r\n     and an evening assigned for that purpose. An evening was also\r\n     given to the Citizens' Suffrage Society of Philadelphia for a\r\n     like object. These meetings were held in the hall of the\r\n     convention, and were largely attended by the members and by the\r\n     people generally. Addresses were delivered by various friends of\r\n     woman suffrage, as representatives of the two societies.[267]\r\n     Still another evening was granted the Pennsylvania association\r\n     for a meeting to be addressed by Bishop Matthew Simpson of the\r\n     Methodist Episcopal Church. The earnest and forcible words of the\r\n     eloquent speaker, and his solid array of arguments, made a deep\r\n     impression on the attentive audience.\r\n\r\n     In the convention the question was discussed during five\r\n     successive days. Hon. John M. Broomall introduced a provision in\r\n     favor of making the ballot free to men and women alike, proposing\r\n     that it be incorporated in the new constitution. This provision\r\n     was ably advocated by Mr. Broomall and many other members of the\r\n     convention. Their firm convictions in behalf of equal and exact\r\n     justice, however well sustained by sound reasoning and earnest\r\n     appeal, was an unequal match for the rooted conservatism which\r\n     recoiled from such a new departure. Although the measure was\r\n     defeated, its discussion had an influence. It was animated,\r\n     intelligent and exhaustive, and drew public attention more\r\n     directly to the subject than anything that had occurred since the\r\n     beginning of its agitation in the State.\r\n\r\n     The only act of the convention that gave hope to the friends of\r\n     impartial suffrage was the adoption of the third section of\r\n     Article X.: \"Women twenty-one years of age and upwards shall be\r\n     eligible to any office of control or management under the school\r\n     laws of this State.\" It was a very faint gleam of comfort, too\r\n     small to stir more than a breath of praise. It had the merit of\r\n     being a step in the right direction, though timid and feeble, and\r\n     as it has never disturbed the equilibrium of society, it may\r\n     ultimately be followed by others of more importance.\r\n\r\n     The annual meetings of the association have been held in\r\n     Philadelphia, Westchester, Bristol, Kennett Square and Media,\r\n     respectively. An interesting feature of the Westchester meeting\r\n     was the reading of an essay, entitled \"Four quite New Reasons why\r\n     you should wish your Wife to Vote.\" It was written for the\r\n     occasion by Eliza Sproat Turner, and was subsequently printed and\r\n     re-printed in tract form by order of the executive committee, and\r\n     freely circulated among the people. It was likewise published in\r\n     the _Woman's Journal_. Other documents relative to the question\r\n     have been printed from time to time by authority of the\r\n     committee, and large numbers of suffrage tracts have been\r\n     purchased for distribution year after year, embodying the best\r\n     thoughts, the soundest arguments, and the most forcible reasoning\r\n     that the question has elicited. Frequent petitions have been sent\r\n     to the legislature and to congress, all having in view the one\r\n     paramount object, and showing by their repeated and persistent\r\n     appearance the indefatigable nature of a living, breathing\r\n     reform. The executive committee at one time employed Matilda\r\n     Hindman as State agent. Meetings were held by her chiefly in the\r\n     western part of the State. In 1874 her services extended to the\r\n     State of Michigan, where the question of woman suffrage was\r\n     specially before the people. Lelia E. Patridge also represented\r\n     the association in Michigan at that time, where she performed\r\n     excellent service in addressing numerous meetings in different\r\n     parts of the State. In 1877 Miss Patridge was appointed to\r\n     represent the society in Colorado. There she labored with others\r\n     to secure the adoption of a constitutional amendment providing\r\n     for suffrage without regard to sex. On several occasions the\r\n     executive committee has contributed to woman suffrage purposes in\r\n     other States. Massachusetts, Michigan, Colorado and Oregon have\r\n     been recipients of the limited resources of the association. The\r\n     executive committee has felt the cramping influence of an\r\n     unfriended treasury. Its provision has been the fruit of\r\n     unwearied soliciting, and should the especial object of the\r\n     association ever be accomplished, the honors of success may be\r\n     fitly contested by the fine art of begging.\r\n\r\nThe following report was sent us by Mrs. Mary Byrnes:\r\n\r\n     March 22, 1872, the Citizens' Suffrage Association of\r\n     Philadelphia was formed, William Morris Davis, president, with\r\n     fifty members. The name of the society was chosen to denote the\r\n     view of its members as to the basis of the elective franchise.\r\n     The amendments to the United States constitution had clearly\r\n     defined who were citizens, and shown citizenship to be without\r\n     sex. Woman was as indisputably a citizen as man. Whatever rights\r\n     he possessed as a citizen she possessed also. The supreme law of\r\n     the land placed her on the same plane of political rights with\r\n     him. If man held the right of suffrage as a citizen of the United\r\n     States, either by birthright within the respective States, or by\r\n     naturalization under the United States, then the right of the\r\n     female citizen to vote was as absolute as that of the male\r\n     citizen; and woman's disfranchisement became a wrong inflicted\r\n     upon her by usurped power. Men became voters by reason of their\r\n     citizenship, having first complied with certain police\r\n     regulations imposed within and by the respective States. The\r\n     Citizens' Suffrage Association demanded the same political rights\r\n     for all citizens, nothing more, nothing less. It repudiated the\r\n     idea that one class of citizens should ask of another class\r\n     rights which that other class never possessed, and which those\r\n     who were denied them never had lost. This society held that the\r\n     right to give implied the right to take away; and further, that\r\n     the right to give implied a right lodged somewhere in society,\r\n     which society had never acquired by any direct concession from\r\n     the people.\r\n\r\n     This society held also, that the theory of the right to the\r\n     franchise, as a gift, bore with it the power somewhere to\r\n     restrict the male citizen's suffrage, and to strike at the\r\n     principle of self-government. They had seen this doctrine\r\n     earnestly advanced. They knew that there was a growing class in\r\n     the country who were inimical to universal suffrage. In view of\r\n     this they chose the name of citizen suffrage, as the highest and\r\n     broadest term by which to designate their devotion to the\r\n     political rights of all citizens. They held that the political\r\n     condition of the white women of the United States was totally\r\n     unlike that of the slave population in this: that while the\r\n     slaves were not considered citizens until the adoption of the\r\n     fourteenth and fifteenth amendments, white women had always been\r\n     citizens, and always entitled to all the political rights of\r\n     citizenship. The colored male citizen became a voter--subject to\r\n     the police regulations of the different States--upon acquiring\r\n     citizenship. No constitutional enactment denied equal political\r\n     rights to women as citizens. No constitutional enactment was\r\n     therefore required to enable them to exercise the right to vote,\r\n     which became the right of male slaves upon their securing\r\n     citizenship under the law. The first legal argument on the\r\n     subject of woman's right to the ballot as a citizen of the United\r\n     States, was made by Jacob F. Byrnes before the Pennsylvania\r\n     Society. Had it been published as soon as written, instead of\r\n     being circulated privately, surprising person after person with\r\n     the position taken, it would have antedated the report of General\r\n     Benjamin F. Butler in the House of Representatives in the winter\r\n     of 1871.\r\n\r\nEdward M. Davis, president for many years, was one of the most\r\nactive and untiring officers of this association, giving generously\r\nof his time and money not only to its support but to the general\r\nagitation of the suffrage question in every part of the country.\r\nThe meetings were held regularly at his office, 333 Walnut street,\r\nas were also those of the Radical Club. This was composed largely\r\nof the same members as the suffrage society, but in this\r\norganization they had a greater latitude in discussion, covering\r\nall questions of political, religious and social interest. As the\r\ndivision in the National Society produced division everywhere,\r\nsome of the friends in Philadelphia made themselves auxiliary to\r\nthe American Association, and the sympathy of others was with the\r\nNational, thus forming two rival societies, which together kept the\r\nsuffrage question before the people and roused their attention,\r\nparticularly to the fact of a pending constitutional convention.\r\nHence the necessity of holding meetings throughout the State, and\r\nrolling up petitions asking that the constitution be so amended as\r\nto secure to women the right to vote. The following appeal was\r\nissued by this association:\r\n\r\n     _To the Editor of the Post:_\r\n\r\n     SIR: There is no political question now before the people of this\r\n     commonwealth more important than the consideration of the changes\r\n     to be made in our constitution. The citizens of the State, by an\r\n     enormous majority of votes, have re-claimed the sovereign powers\r\n     of government, and evinced a determination to re-form the\r\n     fundamental law, the constitution of this State, in the interest\r\n     of a government \"of the people, by the people, and for the\r\n     people.\" In this new adaptation of old rules of government to the\r\n     advanced ideas of the age, it seems to us fitting and opportune\r\n     that woman in her new status as a citizen of the United States\r\n     (under the fourteenth amendment of the constitution), should be\r\n     allowed the exercise of rights which have been withheld under old\r\n     rules of action. Therefore we respectfully ask you to give this,\r\n     with our appeal, an insertion in your paper, and to continue the\r\n     appeal until further notice. And we ask all the friends of woman\r\n     suffrage to aid our association in placing this appeal in each\r\n     paper of our city, as well as of the neighboring towns.\r\n\r\n     \"There is no distinction in citizenship as has been determined by\r\n     the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United\r\n     States. The citizens of Pennsylvania have decided on a revision\r\n     of the constitution of the commonwealth. The power of revision is\r\n     to be delegated by the citizens of the commonwealth to a\r\n     convention. The foundation of free government is based on the\r\n     consent of the governed. Therefore, the Citizens' Suffrage\r\n     Association of Pennsylvania appeals to the sense of right and\r\n     justice in the hearts of the citizens of this State, to aid in\r\n     securing to every citizen, irrespective of sex, an equal voice in\r\n     the selection of delegates, and an equal right, if elected\r\n     thereto, to a seat in said constitutional convention.\"\r\n\r\n                                   WM. MORRIS DAVIS, _Controller_.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Purvis, at the request of the Citizens' Suffrage\r\nAssociation of Philadelphia, waited upon Mrs. President Hayes and\r\npresented to her an address adopted by that society. Mr. Purvis\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n     I have just returned from a very satisfactory and delightful\r\n     interview with Mrs. Hayes. She received me most cordially. I read\r\n     to her the eloquent address from the Citizens' Suffrage\r\n     Association. She listened with marked attention, was grateful for\r\n     the high favor conferred upon her, and sent her best wishes for\r\n     the success of the cause. I made reference to the fact that the\r\n     address bore the honored name of Lucretia Mott, which she\r\n     received with a ready acknowledgment of her great worth and\r\n     usefulness, and her distinguished place as a reformer and\r\n     philanthropist.\r\n\r\nThrough the liberality of Edward M. Davis, this society was able to\r\npublish and circulate an immense number of tracts covering all\r\nphases of the question. He has been one of the few abolitionists\r\nwho have thrown into this movement all the old-time fervor\r\nmanifested in the slavery conflict. A worthy son of the sainted\r\nLucretia Mott, her mantle seems to have fallen on his shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John M. Broomall was ever ready to champion the cause of\r\nequality of rights for women, not only in the legislature and in\r\nthe constitutional conventions of his own State, but on the floor\r\nof congress as well. In a letter giving us valuable information on\r\nseveral points, he says:\r\n\r\n     You ask when I made my first declaration for woman suffrage. I\r\n     cannot tell. I was born in 1816, and one of the earliest settled\r\n     convictions I formed as a man was that no person should be\r\n     discriminated against on account of sect, sex, race or color, but\r\n     that all should have an equal chance in the race which the Divine\r\n     Ruler has set before all; and I never missed an opportunity to\r\n     give utterance to this conviction in conversation, on the stump,\r\n     on the platform and in legislative bodies. My views were set out\r\n     concisely in my remarks in congress, on January 30, 1869, and I\r\n     cite the commencement and conclusion, as I find them in _The\r\n     Globe_ of that date:\r\n\r\n          Every person owing allegiance to the government and not\r\n          under the legal control of another, should have an equal\r\n          voice in making and administering the laws, unless debarred\r\n          for violating those laws; and in this I make no distinction\r\n          of wealth, intelligence, race, family or sex. If just\r\n          government is founded upon the consent of the governed, and\r\n          if the established mode of consent is through the\r\n          ballot-box, then those who are denied the right of suffrage\r\n          can in no sense be held as consenting, and the government\r\n          which withholds that right is as to those from whom it is\r\n          withheld no just government. * * * * The measure now before\r\n          the House is necessary to the complete fulfillment of what\r\n          has gone before it. To hesitate now is to put in peril all\r\n          we have gained. Let this, too, pass into history as an\r\n          accomplished fact. Let it be followed, in due course of\r\n          time, by the last crowning act of the series--an amendment\r\n          to the constitution securing to all citizens of full age,\r\n          without regard to sex, an equal voice in making and amending\r\n          the laws under which they live, to be forfeited only for\r\n          crime. Then the great mission of the party in power will be\r\n          fulfilled; then will have been demonstrated the capacity of\r\n          man for self-government; then a just nation, founded upon\r\n          the full and free consent of its citizens will be no longer\r\n          a dream of the optimist.\r\n\r\nMrs. Virginia Barnhurst writes:\r\n\r\n     I think you should make mention of the few men who, against the\r\n     greatest opposition, stood boldly up and avowed themselves in\r\n     favor of woman's cause. When I think of some of the speeches that\r\n     I heard from the opposite side--expressions which sent the hot\r\n     blood to my face, and which showed the low estimate law-makers\r\n     put upon woman, those few men who dared to defend mothers and\r\n     sisters, stand out in my mind as worthy of having their names go\r\n     down in history--and especially in a history written by women. I\r\n     had a good talk with Lawyer Campbell. He is one of the most\r\n     ardent in the cause; he believes the ballot to be a necessity to\r\n     woman, as a means of self-protection, this necessity being seen\r\n     in the unequal operation of many laws relating to the\r\n     guardianship of children and the ownership of property. Caleb\r\n     White's words have in them the just consciousness of their own\r\n     immortality: \"I want my vote to be recorded; not to be judged of\r\n     here, but to be judged of by coming generations, who, at least,\r\n     will give to woman the rights which God intended she should\r\n     have.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rachel G. Foster]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe constitutional convention to which reference has been so\r\nfrequently made in this chapter, assembled November 12, 1872, and\r\nas early as the 22d, resolutions relative to women holding\r\nschool-offices and to the property-rights of women were presented.\r\nNumberless petitions for these and full suffrage for women were\r\nsent in during the entire sitting of the convention. February 3,\r\n1873, John H. Campbell presented the minority report of the\r\nCommittee on Suffrage and Elections:\r\n\r\n     The undersigned, members of the Committee on Suffrage, Election\r\n     and Representation, dissent from that part of the majority report\r\n     of said committee, which limits the right of suffrage to male\r\n     electors. We recommend that the question, \"Shall woman exercise\r\n     the right of suffrage,\" be submitted by the convention to the\r\n     qualified electors of this commonwealth, and also upon the same\r\n     day therewith, to those women of the commonwealth who upon the\r\n     day of voting shall be of the age of twenty-one years and\r\n     upwards, and have been residents of the State one year, and in\r\n     the district where they offered to vote at least sixty days prior\r\n     thereto; and that if the majority of all the votes cast at said\r\n     election should be in the affirmative, then the word \"male\" as a\r\n     qualification for an elector, contained in section ----, article\r\n     ---- on suffrage and election shall be stricken out, and women in\r\n     this State shall thereafter exercise the right of suffrage,\r\n     subject only to the restrictions placed upon the male voters.\r\n\r\n                                             JOHN H. CAMPBELL,\r\n                                             LEWIS C. CASSIDY,\r\n                                             LEVI ROOKE.\r\n\r\nThe amendment for full suffrage was lost by a vote of 75 to 25,\r\nwith 33 absent, while the amendment making women eligible for\r\nschool offices was carried by a vote of 60 to 32.[268] The debate\r\nby those in favor of the amendment was so ably and eloquently\r\nconducted that we would gladly reproduce it, had not all the\r\nsalient points been so often and so exhaustively presented on the\r\nfloor of congress, and by some of the members from Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAfter the passage of the school law of 1873, it was immediately\r\ntested all over the State, rousing opposition and conflict\r\neverywhere, but the struggle resulted favorably to women, who now\r\nhold many offices to which they were once ineligible. At the first\r\nelection of school directors in Philadelphia the nomination of two\r\nwomen was hotly contested. The _Evening Telegraph_ of February 6,\r\n1874, gives the following:\r\n\r\n     There is progressing in the Thirteenth ward a contest which\r\n     involves so peculiar and important an issue as to merit the\r\n     widest publicity. It illustrates how the rights guaranteed to\r\n     women under the new constitution are to be denied them, if\r\n     cunning and bold chicanery are to be tolerated, by a few ward\r\n     politicians. At the Republican primary election, held January 20,\r\n     Mrs. Harriet W. Paist and Mrs. George W. Woelpper were duly\r\n     nominated as candidates for members of the board of school\r\n     directors of the ward. Both of these ladies received their\r\n     certificates, that given to Mrs. Paist reading as follows:\r\n\r\n     This is to certify that at a meeting of the judges of the\r\n     different divisions of the Thirteenth ward, held in accordance\r\n     with the rules of the Republican party, on the evening of January\r\n     20, 1874, Mrs. Harriet W. Paist was found to be elected as\r\n     candidate upon the Republican ticket from the Thirteenth ward,\r\n     for school director.\r\n\r\n                                    CHARLES M. CARPENTER, _President_.\r\n\r\n     JAMES M. STEWART, } _Clerks_.\r\n     DAVID J. SMITH,   }\r\n\r\n\r\n     No sooner was it ascertained that the ladies had actually become\r\n     candidates on the Republican ticket than a movement was\r\n     inaugurated to oust them, the old war tocsin of \"Anything to beat\r\n     Grant\" being for this purpose amended thus: \"Anything to beat the\r\n     women.\" This antagonism to the fair candidates was based entirely\r\n     upon the supposition that their names would so materially weaken\r\n     the ticket as to place the election of the Republican common\r\n     councilman, Henry C. Dunlap, in the greatest jeopardy. To save\r\n     him, therefore, the managers of the movement must sacrifice\r\n     Mesdames Woelpper and Paist. How was this to be accomplished?\r\n     Each was fortified in her position by a genuine certificate of\r\n     election, and had, furthermore, expressed her determination to\r\n     run. What could not be done fairly must be accomplished by\r\n     strategy. Mr. Ezra Lukens called upon Mrs. Paist, stating that if\r\n     she did not withdraw the Republicans who were opposed to the lady\r\n     candidates would unite with the \"other party\" and defeat the\r\n     Republican ward ticket. Mrs. Paist inquired if she had not been\r\n     regularly nominated, and his reply was that she had been, but\r\n     that her opponents in the party would unite with the \"other\r\n     party\" and defeat her. Mrs. Paist was firm, and Mr. Lukens\r\n     retired foiled. A day or two after, the chairman of the\r\n     Thirteenth ward Republican executive committee received somehow\r\n     this letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   PHILADELPHIA, February 2, 1874.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR: Please accept this as my declination as school director\r\n     on the Thirteenth ward Republican ticket. Hoping it will please\r\n     those opposed to a lady director.\r\n\r\n                         Respectfully yours,         HARRIET W. PAIST.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A week previous to this the husband of Mrs. Woelpper was called\r\n     upon by Mr. William B. Elliott, a member of this executive\r\n     committee, and was informed by him that Mrs. Paist had withdrawn,\r\n     and that it would be unpleasant, if not inexpedient, for Mrs.\r\n     Woelpper to run alone. Mr. Woelpper expressed his belief that if\r\n     such were the case his wife would withdraw. At a meeting of the\r\n     executive committee a short time after, it was announced that\r\n     both the ladies had withdrawn, and everything looked serene for\r\n     victory, when the next day the members were individually informed\r\n     that the letter of declination written above was a base forgery,\r\n     and that neither of the ladies intended to withdraw from the\r\n     contest. Another meeting of the executive committee was held on\r\n     the 2d inst., at which Mr. Woelpper, jr., was present. He\r\n     declared that the statement made to his father was false, and\r\n     that he was present to say for his mother that she was still a\r\n     candidate. This announcement fell like a bomb in a peaceful camp,\r\n     causing great confusion. After order was restored, William B.\r\n     Elliott, the collector, offered a resolution declaring it\r\n     inexpedient to have any ladies on the ticket at this time. This\r\n     resolution was opposed by F. Theodore Walton and a number of the\r\n     members, who denied the power of the committee to change the\r\n     ticket regularly chosen at the primary election. They favored the\r\n     fair candidates, for whose election as school directors the\r\n     constitution had made special provisions, and whose presence in\r\n     the school-boards had been very favorably commented upon by all\r\n     the papers of the city. Besides, the ladies were as legitimately\r\n     entitled to their candidacy as Mr. Dunlap, and it would be a\r\n     gross and unparalelled outrage to sacrifice them from mere\r\n     prejudice, or in the belief that their presence would injure the\r\n     chances of Mr. Dunlap. Then arose Collector Elliott, his face\r\n     fairly glowing with honest indignation, and his voice sharp and\r\n     stinging in his tirade against the newspapers. What did he care\r\n     what the newspapers said? What are the newspapers but sheets sold\r\n     out to the highest bidder? The newspapers, he cried, are all in\r\n     the market, to be bought and sold the same as coal! That was\r\n     their business, and they didn't want stability so long as there\r\n     was cash to be got. Then he came down upon them in a perfect\r\n     whirlwind of wrath for daring to favor the women candidates for\r\n     school directors of the Thirteenth ward, and sat down as though\r\n     he had accomplished a noble purpose.\r\n\r\n     The question on the resolution was pressed, and resulted in its\r\n     adoption by a vote of 20 to 12.[269] A resolution was offered by\r\n     David T. Smith that Mrs. Paist and Mrs. Woelpper be thrown off\r\n     the ticket, and this resolution was carried by the same vote as\r\n     the preceding one. The meeting then adjourned. In consequence of\r\n     this action Mrs. Paist addressed to the citizens of the\r\n     Thirteenth ward the following card, in which she declares that\r\n     she does not intend to resign:\r\n\r\n     _To the Citizens of the Thirteenth Ward.:_\r\n\r\n     Unpleasant though it may be to thus appear before the public, I\r\n     feel that I must, in justice to myself, expose the fraud and\r\n     deception that have been practiced to defeat my election on the\r\n     17th of February next. I received the nomination and certificate\r\n     of election signed by James M. Stewart, David T. Smith, clerks,\r\n     and Charles M. Carpenter, president. Certainly they would not be\r\n     guilty of deceiving, for are they not \"all honorable men\"? John\r\n     B. Green, George M. Taylor and A. W. Lyman then (Ezra Lukens\r\n     having been on a similar fruitless mission) called on the eve of\r\n     January 30, 1874, wishing me to withdraw; stating that Mrs.\r\n     Woelpper had done so (which was false), and they thought it would\r\n     not be pleasant for me to serve. They also placed it on the\r\n     ground of expediency, fearing that their candidate for council\r\n     (Mr. Dunlap) was so weak that a woman on the ticket might\r\n     jeopardize the election. I knew not before that woman held the\r\n     balance of power. After sending their emissaries under the false\r\n     garb of friendship to induce me to decline, without success, they\r\n     were reduced to the desperate means of producing a letter, which\r\n     was read by the secretary of the executive meeting, February 2,\r\n     purporting to come from me, and withdrawing my name. I pronounce\r\n     it publicly to be a forgery. I have not withdrawn, neither do I\r\n     intend to withdraw. Would that I had the power of Brutus or a\r\n     Patrick Henry, that I might put these designing, intriguing\r\n     politicians in their true light! They deserve to be held up to\r\n     the contumely and scorn of the community.\r\n\r\n     _February 3, 1874._                        HARRIET W. PAIST.\r\n\r\n     Despite the action of the committee, these talented ladies will\r\n     be run as the regular candidates for school directors. A\r\n     committee of citizens of the Republican party will prepare the\r\n     tickets and see that they are properly distributed, and take all\r\n     precautions against fraud at the election and against any effort\r\n     that may be made to count out the fair candidates at the meeting\r\n     of the ward return judges. It is of the greatest importance that\r\n     all good citizens of the ward shall do all in their power to\r\n     secure not only the fullest possible number of votes for the lady\r\n     candidates, but a fair count when they have been received. It\r\n     remains to be seen whether the Republican citizens of the ward\r\n     will endorse the action of a committee which from mere prejudice\r\n     can throw off regularly-elected candidates from a ticket.\r\n\r\nThe ladies were elected, and Mrs. Paist served her term. Mrs.\r\nWoelpper died immediately after the election.\r\n\r\nAnna McDowell, in the _Sunday Republic_ of April 8, 1877, in a long\r\narticle shows the necessity of some legal knowledge for women,\r\nenough at least to look after their own interests, and not be\r\ncompelled through their ignorance to trust absolutely to the\r\nprotection of others. They should be trained to understand that all\r\npecuniary affairs should be placed on a business basis as strictly\r\nbetween themselves and their fathers and brothers as men require in\r\ntheir contracts with each other. After giving many instances in\r\nwhich women have been grossly defrauded by their relatives, she\r\npoints to the will of the great railroad king of Pennsylvania:\r\n\r\n     Let us glance for a moment at the will of the late J. Edgar\r\n     Thomson, than which no more unjust testament was ever offered for\r\n     probate. This gentleman, the sole object of affection of two most\r\n     worthy and self-sacrificing sisters, married late in life without\r\n     making any adequate settlement upon the relatives to whom, in a\r\n     great measure, he owed his success. He always promised to provide\r\n     for them amply, saying, repeatedly, in effect, in letters which\r\n     we have seen, \"As my fortune advances so also shall yours; my\r\n     prosperity will be your prosperity,\" etc. Oblivious to the ties\r\n     of nature and affection, however, when he came to make his will\r\n     he, out of a fortune of two millions, bequeathed to these\r\n     sisters, during life, an annuity of $1,200 per annum only,\r\n     leaving the rest of the income of his estate to his wife and her\r\n     niece, the latter a young lady whom he had previously made\r\n     independent by his skilful investment of a few thousand dollars\r\n     left her by her father. Not content with the will which gave her\r\n     also a large income for life out of Mr. Thomson's estate, this\r\n     niece of his wife brought suit against the executors to recover\r\n     bonds found after the death of the testator in an envelope on\r\n     which her name was written, and through the ruling of Judge\r\n     Thayer, a relation by marriage to the husband of the lady, the\r\n     case was decided in her favor, and $100,000 was thus absolutely\r\n     and permanently taken from the fund designed for the asylum which\r\n     it was Mr. Thomson's long-cherished desire to found for the\r\n     benefit and education of orphan girls whose fathers had been or\r\n     might be killed by accident on the Pennsylvania and other\r\n     railroads. The injustice of this decision is made manifest when\r\n     we reflect that the Misses Anna and Adeline Thomson, who worked\r\n     side by side with their brother as civil engineers in their\r\n     father's office, and labored, without pay, therein, that he might\r\n     be educated and sent abroad further to perfect himself in his\r\n     profession, were cut off with a comparatively paltry stipend for\r\n     life, this being still further reduced by the\r\n     collateral-inheritance tax. As high an authority as Dr. William\r\n     A. Hammond says that, \"for a man to cut off his natural heirs in\r\n     his will is _prima facie_ evidence of abberation of mind,\" and we\r\n     believe this to be true.\r\n\r\nHad these sisters[270] been brothers they would have been\r\nrecognized as partners and had their legal proportion of the\r\naccumulations of the business in which they labored in early years\r\nwith equal faithfulness, side by side. This is but another instance\r\nof women's blind faith in the men of their families and of the\r\ndanger in allowing business matters to adjust themselves on the\r\nbasis of honor, courtesy and protection.\r\n\r\nAmong the literary women of the State are Sarah C. Hallowell, on\r\nthe editorial staff of the _Public Ledger_; the daughters of John\r\nW. Forney, for many years in charge of the woman's department of\r\n_Forney's Progress_; Anne McDowell, editor of the woman's\r\ndepartment in _The Sunday Republic_; Mrs. E. A. Wade; \"Bessie\r\nBramble\" of Pittsburg has for many years ably edited a woman's\r\ndepartment in the _Sunday Leader_; Matilda Hindman, an excellent\r\ncolumn in the _Pittsburg Commercial Gazette_. In science Grace Anna\r\nLewis stands foremost. Her paper read before the Woman's Congress\r\nin Philadelphia in 1876, attracted much attention. These ladies\r\nwith others organized \"The Century Club\"[271] in 1876, for\r\npreeminently practical and benevolent work. Its objects are\r\nvarious: looking after working girls, sending children into the\r\ncountry for fresh air during summer, and improving the houses of\r\nthe poor and needy. The Club has a large house to which is attached\r\na cooking-school and lodgings for unfortunates in great\r\nemergencies.\r\n\r\nWoman's ambition was not confined at this period to literature and\r\nthe learned professions; she found herself capable of practical\r\nwork on a large scale in the department of agriculture. The\r\n_Philadelphia Press_ has the following:\r\n\r\n     The beautiful farm of Abel C. Thomas, at Tacony, near\r\n     Philadelphia, is remarkable chiefly because it is managed by a\r\n     woman, Mrs. Louise H. Thomas. Her husband, the intimate friend of\r\n     Horace Greeley, and well known as an author and theologian, in\r\n     time past, has long been too feeble to take any part in managing\r\n     the property. That duty has devolved upon Mrs. Thomas. The house,\r\n     two hundred yards from the Pennsylvania railroad, is hidden from\r\n     view by the trees which surround it. The grounds are tastefully\r\n     laid out, and the lawn mowed with a regularity that indicates\r\n     constant feminine attention. The plot is 20 acres in extent. Six\r\n     acres comprise the orchard and garden. In addition to apple,\r\n     apricot, pear, peach, plum and cherry, there are specimens of all\r\n     kinds of trees, from pine to poplar.\r\n\r\n     A _Press_ reporter recently walked over the premises, and Mrs.\r\n     Thomas explained her manner of doing business. \"I look after\r\n     everything about the farm; take my little sample bags of wheat to\r\n     the mills, and sell the crop by it; and twice I got ten cents\r\n     more a bushel than any of my neighbors. But the things I take\r\n     most interest in are my cows, chickens and bees. My cattle are\r\n     from Jersey island, and pure Alderney. They are very gentle and\r\n     good milkers. From four of them I get about 800 pounds of butter\r\n     a year. The price of this butter varies from 50 cents to $1.00\r\n     per pound. There's my dog. When it's milking time, the hired man\r\n     says to the dog, 'Shep, go after the cows,' and away he goes, and\r\n     in a little while the herd come tinkling up. Why send a man to do\r\n     a boy's work, or a boy to do that which a shepherd dog can do\r\n     just as well? The cows understand him, and readily come when they\r\n     are sent after. Well, so much for the milk department. Now, as to\r\n     the garden; I don't sell much from that. Still, if the vegetables\r\n     were not grown, they would have to be bought, and I take all that\r\n     into consideration in closing accounts. And that's one thing most\r\n     farmers don't do; they don't put on the cash side of the ledger\r\n     the cost of their living, for which they have been to no expense.\r\n     Now, as to the bees. The first cost is about the only expense\r\n     attached to these little workers. I have twenty-five colonies,\r\n     and can, and do handle them with as much safety as if they were\r\n     so much dry wheat. I sell about $100 worth of honey yearly, and\r\n     consume half as much at home. The bees are not troublesome when\r\n     you know how to handle them, but they require to be delicately\r\n     handled at swarming time.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, as to chickens. My stock consists exclusively of the light\r\n     Brahma breed. They come early, grow fast, sell readily, are\r\n     tender, and have no disposition to forage; they are not all the\r\n     time wandering round and flying over the garden fence, and\r\n     scratching up flower and vegetable seeds. In fact, if you'll\r\n     notice, there is a docility about my live-stock that is very\r\n     attractive. The cows and chickens only need articulation to carry\r\n     on conversation. You didn't see the hatching department of my\r\n     chicken-house? I modeled the building after one used by a Madame\r\n     de Linas, a French lady living near Paris, and am much pleased\r\n     with it. I sometimes raise 1,000 chickens a season. I sell them\r\n     at prices all the way up from $1 to $3 apiece. You must remember\r\n     that they are full-blooded, and I always have my stock\r\n     replenished. I keep the best and sell for the highest prices.\r\n     They are generally sold to private families, who wish to get the\r\n     stock, and I always sell them alive. They are not much trouble to\r\n     raise, provided you know how, and have the accommodations for\r\n     doing it. I feed them corn, milk, meal and water, and pay\r\n     particular attention to their being properly housed. The eggs of\r\n     this breed are very rich, and I charge one dollar and a half for\r\n     a setting--that is, thirteen eggs.\r\n\r\n     \"I have some three or four acres of wheat growing and it is\r\n     heading out finely. Oh!\" said Mrs. Thomas, becoming more\r\n     enthusiastic, as she reviewed the incomes from the cereals, cows,\r\n     and chickens, \"I am making money, and money is a standard of\r\n     success, although there is to me a greater pleasure than the mere\r\n     financial part of the business, which comes from the passion I\r\n     have for the life. I wish, indeed, that young ladies would turn\r\n     their attention to this matter. To me, it seems to open to them\r\n     an avenue for acquiring a competency in an independent way; and\r\n     to one who would pursue it earnestly, I know of no avocation\r\n     scarcely worth being classed with it.\"\r\n\r\n     \"And you are not lonesome out here?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Oh! no. I never was lonesome an hour in my life--don't have\r\n     time; I have a great deal of work to do, and am always ready to\r\n     do it. Indeed, the only people I pity are those who do not work,\r\n     or find no interest in it. No, no; I have plenty of visitors, and\r\n     last week Jennie June, Lucretia Mott, and Anna Dickinson paid me\r\n     a visit and were very much pleased while here. I have two\r\n     grown-up boys, one in New York and the other in California; and\r\n     have reared thirteen children besides my own family--colored,\r\n     French, Italian, and I know not what nationalities.\"\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Thomas, who is certainly a remarkable woman, is a thoroughly\r\n     educated one; has traveled extensively both in Europe and this\r\n     country. Herself and husband have been intimate acquaintances of\r\n     many eminent men, among whom were President Lincoln and Secretary\r\n     Stanton. The activity displayed in managing the estate indicates\r\n     the possession of marked executive ability, and the exercise she\r\n     thus receives has doubtless had its share in keeping her young,\r\n     well-preserved, and good-natured.\r\n\r\nWhen the Rev. Knox Little visited this country in 1880, thinking\r\nthe women of America specially needed his ministrations, he\r\npreached a sermon that called out the general ridicule of our\r\nliterary women. In the Sunday _Republic_ of December 12, Anne E.\r\nM'Dowell said:\r\n\r\n     The reverend gentlemen of St. Clement's Church, of this city,\r\n     with their frequent English visiting clergymen, are not only\r\n     trying their best to carry Christianity back into the dark ages,\r\n     by reinvesting it with all old-time traditions and mummeries, but\r\n     they are striving anew to forge chains for the minds,\r\n     consciences, and bodies of women whom the spirit of Christian\r\n     progress has, in a measure, made free in this country. The sermon\r\n     of the Rev. Knox Little, rector of St. Alban's Church,\r\n     Manchester, England, recently delivered at St. Clement's in this\r\n     city, and reported in the daily _Times_, is just such an one as\r\n     might be looked for from the class of thinkers whom he on that\r\n     occasion represented. These ritualistic brethren are bitterly\r\n     opposed to divorce, and hold the belief that so many Britons\r\n     adhere to on their native soil, viz., that \"woman is an inferior\r\n     animal, created only for man's use and pleasure, and designed by\r\n     Providence to be in absolute submission to her lord and master.\"\r\n     The feeling engendered by this belief breeds contempt for and\r\n     indifference to the nobler aspirations of women amongst men of\r\n     the higher ranks, while it crops out in tyranny in the middle,\r\n     and brutality in the lower classes of society. Even the gentry\r\n     and nobility of Great Britain are not all exempt from brutal\r\n     manifestations of power toward their wives. We once sheltered in\r\n     our own house for weeks the wife of an English Earl who had been\r\n     forced to leave her home and family through the brutality of her\r\n     high-born husband--brutality from which the law could not or\r\n     would not protect her. She died at our house, and when she was\r\n     robed for her last rest much care had to be taken to arrange the\r\n     dress and hair so that the scars of wounds inflicted on the\r\n     throat, neck and cheek by her cruel husband might not be too\r\n     apparent.\r\n\r\n     The reports of English police courts are full of disclosures of\r\n     ill-treatment of women by their husbands, and year by year our\r\n     own courts are more densely thronged by women asking safety from\r\n     the brutality of men who at the altar have vowed to \"love, honor\r\n     and protect\" them. In nearly all these cases, the men who are\r\n     brought into our courts on the charge of maltreating women are of\r\n     foreign birth who have been born and brought up under the\r\n     spiritual guidance of such clergymen as the Rev. Knox-Little, who\r\n     tell them, as he told the audience of women to whom he preached\r\n     in this city: \"To her husband a wife owes the duty of unqualified\r\n     obedience. There is _no crime that a man can commit which\r\n     justifies his wife in leaving him_ or applying for that monstrous\r\n     thing, a divorce. It is her duty to submit herself to him\r\n     _always_, and no crime he can commit justifies her lack of\r\n     obedience. If he is a bad or wicked man she may gently\r\n     remonstrate with him, but disobey him, never.\" Again, addressing\r\n     his audience at St. Clement's, he says: \"You may marry a bad man,\r\n     but what of that? You had no right to marry a bad man. If you\r\n     knew it, you deserved it. If you did not know it, you must endure\r\n     it all the same. You can pray for him, and perhaps he will\r\n     reform; but leave him--never. Never think of that accursed\r\n     thing--divorce. Divorce breaks up families--families build up the\r\n     church. The Christian woman lives to build up the church.\" This\r\n     is the sort of sermonizing, reiterated from year to year, that\r\n     makes brutes of Englishmen, of all classes, and sinks the average\r\n     English woman to the condition of a child-bearing slave,\r\n     valuable, mostly, for the number of children she brings her\r\n     husband. She is permitted to hold no opinion unaccepted by her\r\n     master, denied all reason and forced to frequent churches where\r\n     she is forbidden the exercise of her common-sense, and where she\r\n     is told: \"Men are logical; women lack this quality, but have an\r\n     intricacy of thought. There are those who think that women can be\r\n     taught logic; this is a mistake. They can never, by any process\r\n     of education, arrive at the same mental status as that enjoyed by\r\n     man; but they have a quickness of apprehension--what is usually\r\n     called leaping at conclusions--that is astonishing.\"\r\n\r\nDivorce is a question over which woman now disputes man's absolute\r\ncontrol. His canon and civil laws alike have made marriage for\r\nher a condition of slavery, from which she is now seeking\r\nemancipation; and just in proportion as women become independent and\r\nself-supporting, they will sunder the ties that bind them in\r\ndegrading relations.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1880, Governor Hoyt was petitioned to appoint a woman\r\nas member of the State Board of Commissioners of Public Charities.\r\nThe special business of this commission is to examine into the\r\ncondition of all charitable, reformatory and correctional\r\ninstitutions within the State, to have a general oversight of the\r\nmethods of instruction, the well-being and comfort of the inmates,\r\nwith a supervision of all those in authority in such institutions.\r\nDr. Susan Smith of West Philadelphia, from the year of the cruel\r\nimprisonment of the unfortunate Hester Vaughan, regularly for\r\ntwelve years poured petitions into both houses of the legislature,\r\nnumerously signed by prominent philanthropists, setting forth the\r\nnecessity of women as inspectors in the female wards of the jails\r\nof the State, and backing them by an array of appalling facts, and\r\nyet the legislature, from year to year, turned a deaf ear to her\r\nappeals. Happily for the unfortunate wards of the State, the law\r\npassed in 1881.\r\n\r\n     STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE, NORRISTOWN, Pa., Sept. 28, 1885.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MISS ANTHONY: I have referred your letter to my old\r\n     friend, Dr. Hiram Corson, of Plymouth, Pa., who can, if he will,\r\n     give a much better history of the movement in this State, than\r\n     any one else, being one of the pioneers. I hope that you will\r\n     hear from him. If, however, he returns your letter to me, I will\r\n     give you the few facts that I know. I should be glad to have you\r\n     visit our hospital and see our work.\r\n\r\n                         Very respectfully yours,      ALICE BENNETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PLYMOUTH MEETING, Pa., Oct. 2, 1885.\r\n\r\n     MISS SUSAN B. ANTHONY: _Esteemed Friend_:--Dr. Alice Bennett has\r\n     referred your letter with questions to me. Alice Bennett, M. D.,\r\n     Ph. D., is chief physician of the female department of the\r\n     eastern hospital of Pennsylvania, for the insane. She is also\r\n     member of the Montgomery County Medical Society, and member of\r\n     the Medical Society of the State of Pennsylvania. She is the only\r\n     woman in the civilized world, of whom I have ever heard, who has\r\n     entire charge of the female patients in an institution for the\r\n     care and treatment of the insane. We have in the Harrisburg\r\n     hospital, Dr. Jane Garver, as physician for the female insane,\r\n     but she is subordinate to the male physician. She has a female\r\n     physician to assist her. Dr. Bennett was appointed and took\r\n     charge in July, 1880, with Dr. Anna Kingler as her assistant. Dr.\r\n     Kingler resigned, and went to India as medical missionary; was\r\n     succeeded by Dr. Rebecca S. Hunt, who, after more than a year's\r\n     service, also resigned to go to India as medical missionary. Dr.\r\n     Bennett has now two women physicians to assist her in the care of\r\n     more than six hundred patients, nearly as many as, if not more\r\n     than, are in the female departments of the Harrisburg, Danville,\r\n     and Warren hospitals all combined.\r\n\r\n     Dr. Bennett's hospital is a model one. There is a total absence\r\n     of physical restraint, as used formerly under male\r\n     superintendents, and, I may say, as still used in other hospitals\r\n     than that of Norristown. Her skill in providing amusement,\r\n     instruction and employment of various kinds, for the comfort and\r\n     restoration of her patients to sanity and physical health, I feel\r\n     sure has never been equaled in any hospital for the treatment of\r\n     insane women. It is exceedingly interesting to see the school\r\n     which she has established, and in which a large number of the\r\n     insane are daily instructed, amused and interested. It is well\r\n     known, now, that when the mind of the insane can be drawn away\r\n     from their delusions by employment, or whatever else may interest\r\n     them and absorb their attention, they are on the road to health.\r\n     The public are not yet fully awake to the great reform effected\r\n     in having women physicians for the women insane. Insane women\r\n     have been treated as though there were no diseases peculiar to\r\n     the sex. Never, so far as I have been able to learn, have they\r\n     been treated by the means used for the relief of women in their\r\n     homes. An eminent surgeon of Philadelphia informed me a few days\r\n     since, that thirty years ago he was an assistant to Dr.\r\n     Kirkbride, and desired to treat a patient for uterine troubles,\r\n     but was rebuked by Dr. K., and told never to attempt to use the\r\n     appliances relied on in private practice. My informant added that\r\n     he believed not a single insane woman had ever received special\r\n     treatment for affections in any of the hospitals under the care\r\n     of male physicians. While we realize that great advantages would\r\n     have come to these poor unfortunates by proper treatment, we feel\r\n     that no male physician having due regard for his own reputation,\r\n     should attempt to treat an insane woman for uterine diseases by\r\n     means used in private practice, or even in hospitals with sane\r\n     women. And this shows the importance of women physicians for\r\n     women insane. One of the most intellectual and prominent women of\r\n     this State was, 30 years ago, on account of domestic application,\r\n     an inmate of our then champion hospital for the insane, for\r\n     several months, during all of which time her sufferings were, to\r\n     use her own words, indescribable, and yet she was not once asked\r\n     in relation to her physical condition. Let us turn aside from\r\n     this, and glance at the last annual report of Dr. Alice Bennett.\r\n     She reports 180 patients examined for uterine diseases; 125 were\r\n     placed under treatment; 67 treated for a length of time; 60\r\n     benefited by treatment. While Dr. Bennett does not say that their\r\n     insanity was caused by the uterine disease, or that they were\r\n     cured by curing that affection, she observes that in some cases\r\n     the relief of the mind kept pace with the progress of cure of\r\n     the uterine affections. I have, perhaps, written more than was\r\n     needed on this subject, but I am so anxious that we shall have\r\n     women doctors in every hospital for the treatment of insane\r\n     women, and know, too, what influence yourself and good Mrs.\r\n     Stanton can exert by turning your attention to it, which I am\r\n     sure you will as you become informed in relation to the facts,\r\n     that I could not stop short of what I have said. I have prepared\r\n     a full account of our struggles with the State Society during six\r\n     years to obtain for women doctors their proper recognition by the\r\n     profession, and also the obstacles and opposition we encountered\r\n     in our attempt to procure the law empowering boards of trustees\r\n     to appoint women to hospitals for the insane of their sex. It\r\n     will give me pleasure to send them to you if they would be of any\r\n     use to you.\r\n\r\n                         Respectfully,               HIRAM CORSON.\r\n\r\n     As I am within a week of my 82d birthday, and am writing while my\r\n     heart is beating one hundred and sixty times per minute, you must\r\n     not criticise me too sharply.\r\n\r\n                                                                 H. C.\r\n\r\nJanuary 24, 1882, Miss Rachel Foster made all the arrangements for\r\na national convention, to be held in St. George's Hall,\r\nPhiladelphia.[272] She also inaugurated a course of lectures, of\r\nwhich she took the entire financial responsibility, in the popular\r\nhall of the Young Men's Christian Association. Ex-Governor Hoyt of\r\nWyoming, in his lecture, gave the good results of thirteen years'\r\nexperience of woman's voting in that Territory. Miss Foster\r\nemployed a stenographer to report the address, had 20,000 copies\r\nprinted, and circulated them in the Nebraska campaign during the\r\nfollowing summer.\r\n\r\nAt its next session (1883) the legislature passed a resolution\r\nrecommending congress to submit a sixteenth amendment, securing to\r\nwomen the right to vote:\r\n\r\n     HARRISBURG, Pa., March 21, 1883.--In the House, Mr. Morrison of\r\n     Alleghany offered a resolution urging congress to amend the\r\n     national constitution so that the right of suffrage should not be\r\n     denied to citizens of any State on account of sex. It was adopted\r\n     by 78 ayes[273] to 76 noes, the result being greeted with both\r\n     applause and hisses.\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia _Evening Bulletin_ of November 8, 1882, mentions\r\nan attempt to open the University of Pennsylvania to women:\r\n\r\n     The trustees held several meetings to consider the applications.\r\n     Beside Miss Craddock's, there were two others which the faculty\r\n     referred to the trustees, and which appear not to have been\r\n     reached in the regular course of business. Miss Florence Kelley,\r\n     a post-graduate from Cornell University, daughter of Judge\r\n     Kelley, who applied for admission as a special student in Greek,\r\n     and Miss Frances Henrietta Mitchell, a junior student from\r\n     Cornell, who asked to be admitted in the junior class. Our\r\n     information comes from these ladies, who were notified that their\r\n     cases would be presented. The question of coeducation, which has\r\n     been seriously occupying the minds of the trustees of the\r\n     University of Pennsylvania, was settled last evening, at least\r\n     for the present, by the passage of a resolution refusing the\r\n     admission of girls to the department of arts, but proposing to\r\n     establish a separate collegiate department for them, whenever the\r\n     requisite cost, about $300,000, is provided. There has been an\r\n     intelligent and honest difference among both trustees and\r\n     professors on this interesting question, and the diversity has\r\n     been complicated by the various grounds upon which the _pros_ and\r\n     _cons_ are maintained. There are those who advocate the admission\r\n     of girls to the University as a proper thing _per se_. Others\r\n     consent to it, because the University cannot give the desired\r\n     education separately. Others hold that girls should be admitted\r\n     because of their equal rights to a university education, although\r\n     their admission is very undesirable. Others oppose coeducation in\r\n     the abstract, conceding that girls should be as well educated as\r\n     boys, but insisting that they must be differently and therefore\r\n     separately educated. These draw a clear line between \"equal\" and\r\n     \"similar\" education, and hold that no university course of\r\n     studies can be laid out that will not present much of classical\r\n     literature and much of the mental, moral and natural sciences,\r\n     that cannot be studied and recited by boys and girls together,\r\n     without serious risk of lasting injury to both.\r\n\r\nWould it not be better, all things considered, to abjure this kind\r\nof classical literature, and instead of subjecting our sons to its\r\nbaneful influence, give them the refining, elevating companionship\r\nof their sisters? If we would preserve the real modesty and purity\r\nof our daughters, it is quite as important that we should pay some\r\nattention to the delicacy and morality of the men with whom they\r\nare to associate.\r\n\r\nIf a girl cannot read the classics with a young man without\r\ncontamination, how can she live with him in all the intimacies of\r\nfamily life without a constant shock to her refined sensibilities?\r\nSo long as society considers that any man of known wealth is a fit\r\nhusband for our daughters, all this talk of the faculties and\r\ntrustees of our colleges about protecting woman's modesty is the\r\nsheerest nonsense and hypocrisy. It is well to remember that these\r\nprofessors and students have mothers, wives and sisters, and if man\r\nis coarse and brutal, he invariably feels free to show his worst\r\npassions at his own fireside. To warn women against coeducation is\r\nto warn them against association with men in any relation\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[255] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[256] Carrie S. Burnham after long years of preparation and\r\npersistent effort for admission to the bar of Philadelphia, was\r\nadmitted in 1884. She was thoroughly qualified to enter that\r\nprofession and to practice in the courts of that State, and the\r\nonly reason ever offered for her rejection from time to time was,\r\n\"that she was a woman.\"\r\n\r\n[257] By an oversight this law was not mentioned in Vol. I. in its\r\nproper place.\r\n\r\n[258] George W.

When\r\nthe discussion in regard to expelling the young women was pending,\r\nDr. Truman promptly and decidedly told the faculty that if such an\r\nact of injustice was permitted he should leave the college also.\r\nMuch of Dr. Truman's clearsightedness and determination may be\r\ntraced to the influence of his noble wife and no less noble\r\nmother-in-law, Mary Ann McClintock, who helped to inaugurate the\r\nmovement in 1848 in Central New York. She lamented in her declining\r\nyears that she was able to do so little. But by way of consolation\r\nI often suggested that her influence in many directions could never\r\nbe measured; and here is one: Her influence on Dr. Truman opened\r\nthe Dental College to women, and kept it open while Miss Hirschfeld\r\nacquired her profession. With her success in Germany, in the royal\r\nfamily, every child in the palace for generations that escapes a\r\ntoothache will have reason to bless a noble friend, Mary Ann\r\nMcClintock, that she helped to plant the seeds of justice to woman\r\nin the heart of young James Truman. We must also recognize in Dr.\r\nTruman's case that he was born and trained in a liberal Quaker\r\nfamily, his own father and mother having been disciples of Elias\r\nHicks.\r\n\r\n[263] PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 10, 1870.--The formal opening of\r\nSwarthmore College took place this afternoon, when a large number\r\nof its friends were conveyed thither in a special train on the\r\nWestchester railroad. The audience assembled in the lecture room,\r\nwhere addresses were delivered by Samuel Willets and John D. Hyoks,\r\nof New York, Edward Parrish, president of the college, Wm. Dorsey,\r\nand Lucretia Mott. It was stated that the amount spent in land and\r\nbuildings amounted to $205,000 and contributions were solicited for\r\n$100,000 additional to fully furnish the building, and supply a\r\nlibrary, philosophical and astronomical apparatus. The building is\r\na massive one of five stories, constructed of Pennsylvania\r\ngranite, and appointed throughout, from dormitory, bathroom,\r\nrecitation-hall, to parlor, kitchen and laundry, in the most\r\nrefined and substantial taste. It is 400 feet in length, by 100\r\ndeep, presenting two wings for the dormitories of the male and\r\nfemale students respectively, and a central part devoted to parlor,\r\nlibrary, public hall, etc. Especially interesting in this division\r\nof the college is a room devoted to Quaker antiquities, comprising\r\nportraits and writings of the founders of the sect. Among them we\r\nnotice the treaty of William Penn, a picture of the treaty\r\nassembly, a letter of George Fox, etc. The college opens with 180\r\npupils, about equally divided between the sexes, the system of\r\ninstruction being a joint education of boys and girls, though each\r\noccupy separate wings of the building. The institution was built by\r\nthe Hicksite branch of the Society of Friends, but the pupils are\r\nnot confined to members of that persuasion.\r\n\r\n[264] The speakers at this convention were Lucretia Mott, Frances\r\nDana Gage, Wendell Phillips, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B.\r\nAnthony, Edward M.

See--Women Preaching in His Pulpit--The Case Appealed--Mrs.\r\n     Jones, Jailoress--Legislative Hearings.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Jersey was the only State that, in adopting her first\r\nconstitution, recognized woman's right to suffrage which she had\r\nexercised during the colonial days, and from time immemorial in the\r\nmother country. The fact that she was deprived of this right from\r\n1807 to 1840 by a legislative enactment, while the constitution\r\nsecured it,[274] proves that the power of the legislature, composed\r\nof representatives from the people, was considered at that early\r\nday to be above the State constitution. If, then, the legislature\r\ncould abridge the suffrage, it must have the power to extend it,\r\nand all the women of this State should demand is an act of the\r\nlegislature. They need not wait for the slow process of a\r\nconstitutional amendment submitted to the popular vote. In 1868, in\r\nharmony with a general movement in many other States, the women of\r\nNew Jersey began to demand the restoration of their ancient rights.\r\nThe following is from _The Revolution_ of November 19, 1868,\r\nwritten by Elizabeth A. Kingsbury:\r\n\r\n                                   VINELAND, N. J., Nov. 5, 1868.\r\n\r\n     At a meeting of women, held the week before election, a unanimous\r\n     vote was taken that we would go to the polls. John Gage, chairman\r\n     of the Woman Suffrage Association of Vineland, called a meeting,\r\n     and though the day was an inclement one, there was a good\r\n     attendance. A number of earnest men as well as women addressed\r\n     the audience. Among them were Colonel Moss of Missouri, and James\r\n     M. Scovel of Camden, State senator, who strengthened us by their\r\n     words of earnest eloquence. At 7:30 A. M., November 3, John and\r\n     Portia Gage and myself entered Union Hall, where the judges of\r\n     election had already established themselves for the day. Instead\r\n     of occupying the center of the platform, they had taken one side\r\n     of it, apparently for the purpose of leaving us room on the\r\n     other. We seated ourselves in chairs brought for the occasion,\r\n     when one gentleman placed a small table for our use. Another\r\n     inquired if we were comfortable and the room sufficiently warm.\r\n     \"Truly,\" we thought, \"this does not look like a very terrible\r\n     opposition.\" As time passed, there came more men and women into\r\n     the hall. Quite a number of the latter presented their votes\r\n     first at the table where those of men were received, where they\r\n     were rejected with politeness, and then taken to the other side\r\n     of the platform and deposited in our box. Shall I describe this\r\n     box, twelve inches long and six wide, and originally a grape-box?\r\n     Very significant of Vineland. Soon there came to the aid of Mrs.\r\n     Gage and myself a blooming and beautiful young lady, Estelle\r\n     Thomson, who, with much grace and dignity, sat there throughout\r\n     the day, recording the names of the voters. It would have done\r\n     you good to have witnessed the scene. Margaret Pryor,[275] who is\r\n     better known to you perhaps than to many of your readers, as one\r\n     whose life has been active in the cause of freedom for the negro\r\n     and for woman; a charming old lady of eighty-four years, yet with\r\n     the spirit, elasticity and strength of one of thirty-five, sat\r\n     there in her nice Quaker bonnet by the side of Miss Thomson a\r\n     great part of the day. Sarah Pearson, also advanced in years and\r\n     eminent for her labors of love for the suffering and oppressed\r\n     everywhere; with her peculiarly delicate organization and placid\r\n     countenance, remained with us till the last moment. There was no\r\n     lack of friends and supporters. The platform was crowded with\r\n     earnest, refined, intellectual women, who felt that it was good\r\n     for them to be there. One beautiful girl said in my hearing, \"I\r\n     feel so much stronger for having voted.\" It was pleasant to see\r\n     husbands and wives enter the hall together, only they had to\r\n     separate, one turning to the right hand and the other to the\r\n     left, when no separation should have taken place.\r\n\r\n     Some women spent the day in going after their friends and\r\n     bringing them to the hall. Young ladies, after voting, went to\r\n     the homes of their acquaintances, and took care of the babies\r\n     while the mothers came out to vote. Will this fact lessen the\r\n     alarm of some men for the safety of the babies of enfranchised\r\n     women on election day? One lady of refinement and aristocratic\r\n     birth brought her little girl of ten years with her, and I assure\r\n     you it did the men good as well as us. They said they never had\r\n     so quiet and pleasant a time at the polls before, though it is\r\n     always more quiet here than in many other towns, because the sale\r\n     of ardent spirits is forbidden. John Gage--bless his dear\r\n     soul--identifies himself completely with this glorious cause, and\r\n     labors with an earnestness and uniformity of purpose that is\r\n     truly charming. His team was out all day, bringing women to vote,\r\n     half-a-dozen at a time, while his personal efforts were\r\n     unremitting and eminently successful. He and his noble wife,\r\n     Portia, seem to be, indeed, one in thought and action. Some time\r\n     ago he sent a pledge to the candidates for office in this State.\r\n     By signing it, they promise to sustain the cause of woman\r\n     suffrage by every means in their power. Nixon, candidate for the\r\n     Senate, signed it last year. House, candidate for the Assembly,\r\n     signed the pledge at the eleventh hour, and though he lost two of\r\n     our votes by the delay, yet he, too, is elected. Thus we have, at\r\n     least, three public men in New Jersey pledged to sustain the\r\n     woman suffrage cause. We think it is time to say to candidates\r\n     for office: \"You tell us we have a good deal of influence, and\r\n     ask us to exert it for your election. We will do so, if you will\r\n     promise to advocate our cause. If you do not, we will oppose your\r\n     election.\" The result of the ballots cast by the women of\r\n     Vineland is this: For president--Grant, 164; Seymour, 4; E. Cady\r\n     Stanton, 2; Fremont, 1; and Mrs. Governor Harvey of Wisconsin, 1.\r\n     The president of the Historical Society of Vineland, S. C.\r\n     Campbell, has petitioned for the ballot-box and list of voters,\r\n     to put into its archives. He will probably get them.\r\n\r\n     A gentleman said to me last week: \"What is the use of your doing\r\n     this? Your votes will count nothing in the election.\" \"It will do\r\n     good in two ways,\" I replied. \"You say there will not be five\r\n     women there. We will show you that you are mistaken; that women\r\n     do want to vote, and it will strengthen them for action in the\r\n     future.\" Both these ends have been accomplished; and on November\r\n     12 we are to meet again, to consider and decide what to do about\r\n     the taxation that is soon coming upon us.\r\n\r\nWhile the Vineland women expressed their opinion by voting, other\r\ntrue friends of woman's enfranchisement were moved to do the same.\r\n_The Revolution_ of November 12, 1868, gave the following:\r\n\r\n     The Newark _Daily Advertiser_ says that Mrs. Hannah Blackwell, a\r\n     highly esteemed elderly lady, long resident in Roseville, and\r\n     Mrs. Lucy Stone, her daughter-in-law, both of them\r\n     property-holders and tax-payers in the county, appeared at the\r\n     polls in Roseville Park, accompanied by Messrs. Bathgate and\r\n     Blackwell as witnesses, and offered their votes. The judges of\r\n     election were divided as to the propriety of receiving the votes\r\n     of the ladies, one of them stating that he was in favor of doing\r\n     so, the two others objecting on the ground of their illegality.\r\n     The ladies stated that they had taken advice of eminent lawyers,\r\n     and were satisfied that in New Jersey, women were legally\r\n     entitled to vote, from the fact that the old constitution of the\r\n     State conferred suffrage upon \"all inhabitants\" worth $250. Under\r\n     that constitution women did in fact vote until, in 1807, by an\r\n     arbitrary act of the legislature, women were excluded from the\r\n     polls. The new constitution, adopted in 1844, was framed by a\r\n     convention and adopted by a constituency, from both of which\r\n     women were unconstitutionally excluded, so that they have never\r\n     been allowed to vote upon the question of their own\r\n     disfranchisement. The article in the present constitution on the\r\n     right of suffrage confers it upon white male citizens, but does\r\n     not expressly limit it to such. It is claimed that from the\r\n     absence of any express limitation in the present constitution,\r\n     and from the compulsory exclusion of the parties interested from\r\n     its adoption, the political rights of women under the old\r\n     constitution still remain. Mrs. Stone stated these points to the\r\n     judges of election with clearness and precision. After\r\n     consultation, the votes of the ladies were refused. The crowd\r\n     surrounding the polls gathered about the ballot-box and listened\r\n     to the discussion with respectful attention; but every one\r\n     behaved with the politeness which gentlemen always manifest in\r\n     the presence of ladies.\r\n\r\nThe women of New Jersey may have been roused to assert their right\r\nto vote by an earnest appeal of that veteran of equal rights,\r\nParker Pillsbury, in _The Revolution_ of March 25, 1868, suggested\r\nby the following:\r\n\r\n     At the recent election in Vineland, New Jersey, a unanimous vote\r\n     in favor of \"no rum\" was polled. The Vineland _Weekly_ says:\r\n     \"Among the incidents of the late election was the appearance of a\r\n     woman at the polls. Having provided herself with a ballot, she\r\n     marched up to the rostrum and tendered it to the chairman of the\r\n     board of registry. The veteran politician, John Kandle, covered\r\n     with blushes, was obliged to inform the lady that no one could\r\n     vote unless his name was registered. She acquiesced in the\r\n     decision very readily, saying she only wished to test a\r\n     principle, and retired very quietly from the hall.\"\r\n\r\nWhile thus mentioning the women with uncounted votes, it may be\r\nwell to embalm here a historical fact, published in April, 1868:\r\n\r\n     In the year 1824 widows were allowed to vote in New Jersey on\r\n     their husbands' tax receipts. The election officers paid great\r\n     deference to the widows on these occasions, and took particular\r\n     care to send carriages after them, so as to get their votes early\r\n     and make sure of them. The writer of this has often heard his\r\n     grandmother state that she voted for John Quincy Adams for\r\n     president of the United States when he was elected to that\r\n     office. Her name was Sarah Sparks, and she voted at Barnsboro',\r\n     her husband having died the year previous.\r\n\r\n                                   N. M. WALLINGTON, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony held a spirited meeting in Rahway on Christmas eve,\r\nDecember 24, 1867. The following October, 1868, Mrs. Stanton and\r\nMiss Anthony attended a two days' convention in Vineland, and\r\nhelped to rouse the enthusiasm of the people. A friend, writing\r\nfrom there, gives us the following:\r\n\r\n     The Unitarian church in this town is highly favored in having for\r\n     its pastor a young man of progressive and thoroughly liberal\r\n     ideas. Rev. Oscar Clute is well known as an earnest advocate in\r\n     the cause of woman. Last Sunday the communion or Lord's Supper\r\n     was administered in his church. One of the laymen who usually\r\n     assists in the distribution of the bread and wine, was absent,\r\n     and Mr. Clute invited one of the women to officiate in his stead.\r\n     She did so in such a sweet and hospitable manner that it gave new\r\n     interest to the occasion. Even those who do not like innovations\r\n     could not find fault. And why should any one be displeased? The\r\n     Christ of the sacrament was the emancipator of women. In olden\r\n     time they had deaconesses, and in most of our churches women\r\n     constitute a majority of the communicants, so it seems\r\n     particularly appropriate that they should be served by women.\r\n     Women vote on all matters connected with this church, they are on\r\n     all \"standing committees,\" and sometimes are chosen and act as\r\n     trustees.\r\n\r\nRev. Phebe A. Hanaford sends us the following reports of the\r\nprogress of the movement in this State:\r\n\r\n\r\n     While Lucy Stone resided in New Jersey, she held several series\r\n     of meetings in the chief towns and cities before the formation of\r\n     the State Society.[276] The agitation that began in 1867 was\r\n     probably due to her, more than to any other one person in that\r\n     State. The State society was organized in the autumn of 1867, and\r\n     from year to year its annual meetings have been held in Vineland,\r\n     Newark, Trenton, and other cities. On its list of officers[277]\r\n     are some of the best men and women in the State. Several\r\n     distinguished names from other States are among the speakers[278]\r\n     who have taken part in their conventions. County and local\r\n     societies too have been extensively organized. These associations\r\n     have circulated tracts and appeals, memorialized the legislature,\r\n     and had various hearings before that body. At the annual meeting\r\n     held in Newark February 15, 1871, the following memorial to the\r\n     legislature, prepared by Mary F. Davis, was unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n          _To the Honorable the Senate and General Assembly of the\r\n          State of New Jersey:_\r\n\r\n          Section 2, Article 1, of the constitution of the State of\r\n          New Jersey, expressly declares that \"All political power is\r\n          inherent in the people. Government is instituted for the\r\n          protection, security, and benefit of the people, and they\r\n          have the right at all times to alter or reform the same,\r\n          whenever the public good may require it.\" Throughout the\r\n          entire article the words \"people\" and \"person\" are used, as\r\n          if to apply to all the inhabitants of the State. In direct\r\n          contradiction to this broad and just affirmation, section 1,\r\n          article 2, begins with the restrictive and unjust sentence:\r\n          \"Every white male citizen of the United States, at the age\r\n          of twenty-one years * * * shall be entitled to vote,\" etc.,\r\n          and the section ends with the specification that \"no pauper,\r\n          idiot, insane person, or person convicted of a crime * * *\r\n          shall enjoy the right of an elector.\"\r\n\r\n          Of the word \"white\" in this article your memorialists need\r\n          not speak, as it is made a dead letter by the limitations of\r\n          the fifteenth amendment to the United States constitution.\r\n          To the second restriction, indicated by the word \"male\" we\r\n          beg leave to call the attention of the legislature, as we\r\n          deem it unjust and arbitrary, as well as contradictory to\r\n          the spirit of the constitution, as expressed in the first\r\n          article. It is also contrary to the precedent established by\r\n          the founders of political liberty in New Jersey. On the\r\n          second of July, 1776, the provincial congress of New Jersey,\r\n          at Burlington, adopted a constitution which remained in\r\n          force until 1844; in which section 4 specified as voters,\r\n          \"all the inhabitants of this Colony, of full age,\" etc. In\r\n          1790, a committee of the legislature reported a bill\r\n          regulating elections, in which the words \"he and she\" are\r\n          applied to voters, thus giving legislative endorsement to\r\n          the alleged meaning of the constitution.\r\n\r\n          The legislature of 1807 departed from this wise and just\r\n          precedent, and passed an arbitrary act, in direct violation\r\n          of the constitutional provision, restricting the suffrage to\r\n          white male adult citizens, and this despotic ordinance was\r\n          deliberately endorsed by the framers of the State\r\n          constitution which was adopted in 1844. This was plainly an\r\n          act of usurpation and injustice, as thereby a large\r\n          proportion of the law-abiding citizens of the State were\r\n          disfranchised, without so much as the privilege of\r\n          signifying their acceptance or rejection of the barbarous\r\n          fiat which was to rob them of the sacred right of\r\n          self-protection by means of a voice in the government, and\r\n          to reduce them to the political level of the \"pauper, idiot,\r\n          insane person, or person convicted of crime.\"\r\n\r\n          If this flagrant wrong, which was inflicted by one-half the\r\n          citizens of a free commonwealth on the other half, had been\r\n          aimed at any other than a non-aggressive and\r\n          self-sacrificing class, there would have been fierce\r\n          resistance, as in the case of the United Colonies under the\r\n          British yoke. It has long been borne in silence. \"The right\r\n          of voting for representatives,\" says Paine, \"is the primary\r\n          right, by which other rights are protected. To take away\r\n          this right is to reduce man to a state of slavery, for\r\n          slavery consists in being subject to the will of another,\r\n          and he that has not a vote in the electing of\r\n          representatives is in this condition.\" Benjamin Franklin\r\n          wrote: \"They who have no voice nor vote in the electing of\r\n          representatives do not enjoy liberty, but are absolutely\r\n          enslaved to those who have votes and to their\r\n          representatives; for to be enslaved is to have governors\r\n          whom other men have set over us, and be subject to laws made\r\n          by the representatives of others, without having had\r\n          representatives of our own to give consent in our behalf.\"\r\n          This is the condition of the women of New Jersey. It is\r\n          evident to every reasonable mind that these unjustly\r\n          disfranchised citizens should be reinstated in the right of\r\n          suffrage. Therefore, we, your memorialists, ask the\r\n          legislature at its present session to submit to the people\r\n          of New Jersey an amendment to the constitution, striking out\r\n          the word \"male\" from article 2, section 1, in order that the\r\n          political liberty which our forefathers so nobly bestowed on\r\n          men and women alike, may be restored to \"all inhabitants\" of\r\n          the populous and prosperous State into which their brave\r\n          young colony has grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cornelia Collins Hussey]\r\n\r\n\r\n     With but a slight change of officers and arguments, these\r\n     conventions were similar from year to year. There were on all\r\n     occasions a certain number of the clergy in opposition. At one of\r\n     these meetings the Rev. Mr. McMurdy condemned the ordination of\r\n     women for the ministry. But woman's fitness[279] for that\r\n     profession was successfully vindicated by Lucretia Mott and Phebe\r\n     A. Hanaford. Mrs. Portia Gage writes, December 12, 1873:\r\n\r\n          There was an election held by the order of the township\r\n          committee of Landis, to vote on the subject of bonding the\r\n          town to build shoe and other factories. The call issued was\r\n          for all legal voters. I went with some ten or twelve other\r\n          women, all taxpayers. We offered our votes, claiming that we\r\n          were citizens of the United States, and of the State of New\r\n          Jersey, also property-holders in and residents of Landis\r\n          township, and wished to express our opinion on the subject\r\n          of having our property bonded. Of course our votes were not\r\n          accepted, whilst every _tatterdemalion_ in town, either\r\n          black or white, who owned no property, stepped up and very\r\n          pompously said what he would like to have done with his\r\n          property. For the first time our claim to vote seemed to\r\n          most of the voters to be a just one. They gathered together\r\n          in groups and got quite excited over the injustice of\r\n          refusing our vote and accepting those of men who paid no\r\n          taxes.\r\n\r\n     In 1879, the Woman's Political Science Club[280] was formed in\r\n     Vineland, which held its meetings semi-monthly, and discussed a\r\n     wide range of subjects. Among the noble women in New Jersey who\r\n     have stood for many years steadfast representatives of the\r\n     suffrage movement, Cornelia Collins Hussey of Orange is worthy of\r\n     mention. A long line of radical and brave ancestors[281] made it\r\n     comparatively easy for her to advocate an unpopular cause. Her\r\n     father, Stacy B. Collins, identified with the anti-slavery\r\n     movement, was also an advocate of woman's right to do whatever\r\n     she could even to the exercise of the suffrage. He maintained\r\n     that the tax-payer should vote regardless of sex, and as years\r\n     passed on he saw clearly that not alone the tax-payer, but every\r\n     citizen of the United States governed and punished by its laws,\r\n     had a just and natural right to the ballot in a country claiming\r\n     to be republican. The following beautiful tribute to his memory,\r\n     by Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, is found in a letter to his daughter:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        LONDON, July 27, 1873.\r\n\r\n          My last letter from America brought me the sad intelligence\r\n          of your dear father's departure from amongst you; and I\r\n          cannot refrain from at once writing and begging you to\r\n          accept the sincere sympathy and inevitable regret which I\r\n          feel for your loss. The disappearance of an old friend\r\n          brings up the long past times vividly to my remembrance--the\r\n          time when, impelled by irresistible spiritual necessity, I\r\n          strove to lead a useful but unusual life, and was able to\r\n          face, with the energy of youth, both social prejudice and\r\n          the hindrance of poverty. I have to recall those early days\r\n          to show how precious your father's sympathy and support were\r\n          to me in that difficult time; and how highly I respected his\r\n          moral courage in steadily, for so many years, encouraging\r\n          the singular woman doctor, at whom everybody looked askance,\r\n          and in passing whom so many women held their clothes aside,\r\n          lest they should touch her. I know in how many good and\r\n          noble things your father took part; but, to me, this brave\r\n          advocacy of woman as physician, in that early time, seems\r\n          the noblest of his actions.\r\n\r\n     Speaking of the general activity of the women of Orange, Mrs.\r\n     Hussey says:\r\n\r\n          The Women's Club of Orange was started in 1871. It is a\r\n          social and literary club, and at present (1885) numbers\r\n          about eighty members. Meetings are held in the rooms of the\r\n          New England Society once in two weeks, and a reception, with\r\n          refreshments, given at the house of some member once a year.\r\n          Some matter of interest is discussed at each regular\r\n          meeting. This is not an equal suffrage club, yet a steady\r\n          growth in that direction is very evident. Very good work has\r\n          been done by this club. An evening school for girls was\r\n          started by it, and taught by the members for awhile, until\r\n          adopted by the board of education, a boys' evening school\r\n          being already in operation. Under the arrangements of the\r\n          club, a course of lectures on physiology, by women, was\r\n          recently given in Orange, and well attended. At the house of\r\n          one of the members a discussion was held on this subject:\r\n          \"Does the Private Character of the Actor Concern the\r\n          Public?\" Although the subject was a general one, the\r\n          discussion was really upon the proper course in regard to\r\n          M'lle Sarah Bernhardt, who had recently arrived in the\r\n          country. Reporters from the New York _Sun_ attended the\r\n          meeting, so that the views of the club of Orange gained\r\n          quite a wide celebrity.\r\n\r\n     Of Mrs. Hussey's remarks, the Newark _Journal_ said:\r\n\r\n          The sentiments of the first speaker, Mrs. Cornelia C.\r\n          Hussey, were generally approved, and therefore are herewith\r\n          given in full: \"I have so often maintained in argument that\r\n          one has no right to honor those whose lives are a dishonor\r\n          to virtue or principle, that I cannot see any other side to\r\n          our question than the affirmative. That the stage wields a\r\n          potent influence cannot be doubted. Let the plays be\r\n          immoral, and its influence must be disastrous to virtue. Let\r\n          the known character of the actor be what we cannot respect,\r\n          the glamour which his genius or talent throws around that\r\n          bad character will tend to diminish our discrimination\r\n          between virtue and vice, and our distaste for the latter.\r\n          Some one says: 'Let me write the songs of a nation, and I\r\n          care not who makes the laws.' The poetry that Byron wrote,\r\n          together with his well-known contempt for a virtuous life,\r\n          is said to have had a very pernicious influence on the young\r\n          men of his time, and probably, too, blinded the eyes of the\r\n          young women. I recall being quite startled by reading the\r\n          essay of Whittier on Byron, which showed him as he was, and\r\n          not with the halo of his great genius thrown around his\r\n          vices. It seemed to me that our national government\r\n          dethroned virtue when it sent a homicide, if not a murderer,\r\n          to represent us at a foreign court; and again when it sent\r\n          as minister to another court on the continent a man whose\r\n          private character was well known to be thoroughly immoral.\r\n          Even to trifle with virtue, or to be a coward in the cause\r\n          of principle, is a fearful thing; but when, a person comes\r\n          before the public, saying by his life that he prefers the\r\n          pleasures of sin to the paths of virtue, it seems to me that\r\n          the way is plain--to withhold our patronage as a matter of\r\n          public policy.\"\r\n\r\n          On the Fourth of July, 1874, Mrs. Lillie Devereux Blake was\r\n          invited to make the usual address in East Orange, which she\r\n          did before a large audience in the public hall. Says the\r\n          _Journal_: \"Mrs. Blake's speech was characterized by\r\n          simplicity of style and appropriateness of sentiment.\" She\r\n          made mention of Molly Pitcher, Mrs. Borden and Mrs. Hall of\r\n          New Jersey, and of noted women of other States, who did good\r\n          service in Revolutionary times, when the country needed the\r\n          help of her daughters as well as her sons.\r\n\r\n          In the summer of 1876 a noteworthy meeting was held in\r\n          Orange in the interest of women. A number of ladies and\r\n          gentlemen met in my parlor to listen to statements in\r\n          relation to what is called the \"social evil,\" to be made by\r\n          the Rev. J. P. Gledstone and Mr. Henry J. Wilson, delegates\r\n          from the \"British, Continental and General Federation for\r\n          the Abolition of Government Regulation of Prostitution.\" It\r\n          is due to the English gentlemen to say that they gave some\r\n          very strong reasons for bringing the disagreeable subject\r\n          before the meeting, and that they handled it with becoming\r\n          delicacy, though with great plainness.\r\n\r\n          \"Ann A. Horton, who died in June, 1875, at the Old Ladies'\r\n          Home, Newark, bequeathed $2,000 to Princeton College, to\r\n          found a scholarship to be called by her name.\" Would not the\r\n          endowment of a \"free bed\" in Mrs. Horton's true alma-mater,\r\n          the Old Ladies' Home, have been a far wiser bequest than the\r\n          foundation of a scholarship in Princeton--a college which,\r\n          while fattening on enormous dole received from women, offers\r\n          them nothing in return?\r\n\r\n     In relation to the law giving the mothers of New Jersey some\r\n     legal claim to their children, Mrs. Hussey writes:\r\n\r\n          I have often heard it said that Kansas is the only State\r\n          where the married mother has any legal ownership in her\r\n          children; but the women of New Jersey have enjoyed this\r\n          _privilege_ since 1871, when it was gained for them by the\r\n          efforts of Mrs. Ann H. Connelly of Rahway. She was an\r\n          American woman, the mother of one daughter, and unhappily\r\n          married. She desired to be divorced from her husband, but\r\n          she knew that in such case he might legally take her child\r\n          from her. Such a risk could not be thought of for a moment;\r\n          so she applied to the legislature for a change of the law.\r\n          She was assisted by many influential citizens, both men and\r\n          women; petitions largely signed were presented, and the\r\n          result was the amendment of the law making the mother and\r\n          father equal in the ownership of their children. When a copy\r\n          of the new law appeared in our papers I wrote to Mrs.\r\n          Connelly, inclosing a resolution of thanks from the Essex\r\n          County Woman Suffrage Society, of which I was then\r\n          secretary. In her reply she said: \"This unexpected and\r\n          distinguishing recognition of my imperfect, but earnest,\r\n          efforts for justice is inexpressibly gratifying.\" Several\r\n          years after, I went with my daughter to Rahway to see Mrs.\r\n          Connelly. She seemed to be well known and much respected.\r\n          She was teaching in one of the public schools, but seemed\r\n          quite feeble in health. In 1881 I saw the notice of her\r\n          death. She was a woman of much intelligence, and strongly\r\n          interested in suffrage, and should certainly be held in\r\n          grateful remembrance by the mothers of New Jersey, to whom\r\n          she restored the right which nature gave them, but which\r\n          men had taken away by mistaken legislation.\r\n\r\n     This law of February 21, 1871, composed of several acts\r\n     purporting to give fathers and mothers equal rights in cases of\r\n     separation and divorce, is not so liberal as it seems in\r\n     considering this provision:\r\n\r\n          Upon a decree of divorce the court may make such further\r\n          decree as may be deemed expedient concerning the custody and\r\n          maintenance of minor children, and determine with which of\r\n          the parents the children shall remain.\r\n\r\n     This act, though declaring that the mother and father are equal,\r\n     soon shows by its specifications that the courts can dispose of\r\n     all woman's interests and affections as they may see fit. What\r\n     avails a decree of divorce or separation for woman, if the court\r\n     can give the children to the father at its pleasure? Here is the\r\n     strong cord by which woman is held in bondage, and the courts,\r\n     all composed of men, know this, and act on it in their decisions.\r\n\r\n     A petition was addressed to the constitutional commission of\r\n     1873, requesting an amendment restoring to the women of New\r\n     Jersey their original right to vote, which that body decided\r\n     would be \"inexpedient.\" A bill introduced in the legislature by\r\n     Senator Cutler, of Morris county, making women eligible to the\r\n     office of school-trustee, became a law March 25, 1873:\r\n\r\n          Be it enacted, That hereafter no person shall be eligible to\r\n          the office of school-trustee, unless he or she can read and\r\n          write; and women who are residents in the district and over\r\n          twenty years of age, shall also be eligible to the office of\r\n          school-trustee, and may hold such office and perform the\r\n          duties of the same, when duly elected by ten votes of the\r\n          district.--[Chap. 386.\r\n\r\n     February 26, 1874, a law for the better protection of the\r\n     property of married women was passed:\r\n\r\n          1. Be it enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the\r\n          State of New Jersey, That any married woman who now is, or\r\n          may hereafter become, entitled, by gift, devise or bequest,\r\n          to any contingent estate, or any interest in any real or\r\n          personal property or estate, may, with the concurrence of\r\n          her husband, compound and receipt for, assign and convey the\r\n          same, in all cases where she lawfully might, if a _feme\r\n          sole_; and every release, receipt, assignment, discharge,\r\n          agreement, covenant, or contract, thereupon entered into by\r\n          her in regard to the same and to the said property, shall be\r\n          as valid and binding in every respect, upon her, her heirs,\r\n          executors, administrators, and assigns, and any and all\r\n          persons claiming under her, them or either of them, as if\r\n          she were at the time of entering into the same, a _feme\r\n          sole_, and when duly executed and acknowledged in the manner\r\n          provided by law for conveyance of real estate, may be\r\n          recorded in the surrogate's office, and whenever it relates\r\n          to real estate in the clerk's or recorder's office, of the\r\n          proper county or counties, in the same manner and with like\r\n          effect as other receipts and discharges may now be recorded\r\n          therein. 2. And be it enacted. That this act shall take\r\n          effect immediately.\r\n\r\n     A most remarkable trial, lately held in Newark, New Jersey, which\r\n     involved the question whether it was contrary to Scripture, and a\r\n     violation of the rules of the Presbyterian Church, to admit women\r\n     to the pulpit, is well reported by the New York _World_, January\r\n     1, 1877:\r\n\r\n          Since the time that the Rev. Theodore Cuyler was obliged by\r\n          the Presbytery of Long Island to apologize for inviting Miss\r\n          Sarah Smiley, the Quaker preacher, to occupy the pulpit of\r\n          the Lafayette Avenue Church in Brooklyn, the question of the\r\n          right of women to preach in Presbyterian churches, has come\r\n          up in various parts of the country, but has never been\r\n          brought judicially before any ecclesiastical body until\r\n          yesterday, when it occupied the attention of the Newark\r\n          Presbytery, under the following circumstances. October 29,\r\n          1876, Mrs. L. S. Robinson and Mrs. C. S. Whiting, two ladies\r\n          who were much interested in the temperance movement, asked\r\n          and received permission of the Rev. Isaac M. See, of the\r\n          Wickliffe Presbyterian Church at Newark, to occupy his\r\n          pulpit, morning and evening of that day. They accordingly\r\n          addressed the congregation on the subject of temperance. To\r\n          this the Rev. E. R. Craven, of the Third Presbyterian\r\n          Church, of Newark, objected, and brought before the Newark\r\n          Presbytery the following charge:\r\n\r\n          \"The undersigned charges the Rev. Isaac M. See, pastor of\r\n          the Wickliffe Church, of Newark, N. J., a member of your\r\n          body, with disobedience to the divinely enacted ordinance in\r\n          reference to the public speaking and teaching of women in\r\n          churches, as recorded in I. Corinthians, xiv., 33 to 37, and\r\n          I. Timothy, ii., 13, in that: First specification--On\r\n          Sunday, October 29, 1876, in the Wickliffe Church of the\r\n          city of Newark, N. J., he did, in the pulpit of the said\r\n          church, and before the congregation there assembled for\r\n          public worship at the usual hour of the morning service,\r\n          viz., 10:30 A.M., introduce a woman, whom he permitted and\r\n          encouraged then and there publicly to preach and teach.\" The\r\n          second specification is couched in similar language, except\r\n          that it charges Mr. See with introducing another woman at\r\n          the evening service upon the same day. The charge was\r\n          presented at the regular meeting of the Presbytery, a short\r\n          time ago, and the hearing of the case was adjourned until\r\n          yesterday. The meeting was held in the lecture room of the\r\n          Second Presbyterian Church in Washington street. Rev. John\r\n          L. Wells, pastor of the Bethany Mission Chapel, presided,\r\n          and there was a fair attendance of the members of the body.\r\n          Of the audience at least nine-tenths were women.[282] Dr.\r\n          Craven, the prosecutor, sat on the front row of seats, near\r\n          to the clerk's table, while Dr. See, who is very stout, with\r\n          a double chin, and the picture of good-nature, sat in the\r\n          rear of the members of the Presbytery, and among the front\r\n          rows of spectators. Dr. McIllvaine introduced the following\r\n          resolution:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That this charge, by common consent of the\r\n          parties, be dismissed at this stage of the proceedings, with\r\n          affectionate council to the Rev. Dr. See not to go contrary\r\n          to the usages of the Presbyterian Church for the future.\r\n\r\n          This brought Brother See to his feet. He could not, he said,\r\n          assent to Brother McIllvaine's resolution. He had not\r\n          consented that the charge should be dismissed, as in the\r\n          resolution. Brother McIllvaine expressed himself as sure\r\n          that Brother See had consented, but Brother See was again\r\n          equally sure that he had not. Some member here suggested\r\n          that Dr. Craven should first have been asked if he consented\r\n          to dismiss the charge, and this brought that gentleman to\r\n          his feet. A more complete antithesis to Dr. See cannot be\r\n          imagined. He is tall, gaunt, with full beard and mustache,\r\n          short, bristling hair, that stands upright in a row from the\r\n          centre of his forehead to the crown of his head. He said\r\n          that at the request of Dr. McIllvaine and another respected\r\n          member of the Presbytery he had said that if the party\r\n          charged would give full and free consent to the resolution,\r\n          he would also assent; \"and,\" he added, \"such is now my\r\n          position.\" Dr. McIllvaine then gave at length his reasons\r\n          for desiring to arrest the case where it was. No good could\r\n          come of its discussion, and the result could not but be\r\n          productive of discord. The Moderator reminded Dr. See that\r\n          they waited for an answer from him.\r\n\r\n          Dr. See--May we have a season of prayer, sir? The Moderator\r\n          said there was no objection. Dr. See explained that the\r\n          matter at issue was not a personal one; it was a question as\r\n          to the meaning of the Scriptures upon a certain point, and\r\n          he was there simply to know what the Presbytery would do.\r\n          Rev. Drs. Brinsmayd and Fewsmith then prayed, but Dr. See's\r\n          frame of mind was not in the least changed. He still\r\n          insisted that his was the passive part, to sit and see what\r\n          they would do with his case. Rev. Dr. Wilson thought that if\r\n          Brother See did not desire to do anything contrary to the\r\n          usages of the church, he might say so. Brother See said it\r\n          was a question of whether God Almighty had said certain\r\n          things or not, and that he could not answer. In his formal\r\n          answer to the charge the accused then said: \"I believe\r\n          myself to be not guilty of the charge, but I admit the\r\n          specifications.\" Dr. Craven, in his speech, said it was in\r\n          no spirit of animosity that he had brought the charge. He\r\n          believed that the law of God had been broken in this case;\r\n          not designedly, perhaps, but really. A custom had found\r\n          lodgment in a Presbyterian church that would impair its\r\n          efficiency and would also injure woman in the sphere which\r\n          she was called upon by God to fill. No judicial decision had\r\n          been arrived at upon this question. The case of Dr. Cuyler\r\n          was the first that had come before a Presbytery, and that\r\n          was hardly a trial of the question. \"Why should I,\" he\r\n          continued, \"bring this charge? Because I have felt it to be\r\n          wrong, and feeling thus, resolved to take the duty upon\r\n          myself, painful and agonizing as the task may be. I deem it\r\n          my duty to God to do so.\" Dr. See (_sotto voce_)--\"And the\r\n          Lord will bless you for it.\"\r\n\r\n          Dr. Craven, continuing, read the passages of Scripture\r\n          referred to in this charge. He did not, he said, affirm that\r\n          woman had no work in the church. She had a great and\r\n          glorious sphere; she had no right to teach and speak in\r\n          public meetings, but she could teach children and ignorant\r\n          men in private. He would not affirm that some women could\r\n          not preach as well as, or better than some men, and he did\r\n          not know but that in the future she might occupy the\r\n          platform on an equality with men; but at present she could\r\n          not, and it was expressly forbidden in the passages which he\r\n          had read. \"You may run to hear another man's wife preach, or\r\n          another man's daughter,\" said he, \"but who would have his\r\n          own wife stand upon the platform, or his own daughter face\r\n          the mob? Woman is the heart of man, but man is the head. Let\r\n          woman go upon the platform, and she loses that shrinking\r\n          modesty that gives her such power over children. What child\r\n          would wish to have a public-speaking mother? I trust this\r\n          evil will not creep in upon the church. I felt bound to\r\n          resist it at the outset, and unless I am convinced of my\r\n          error shall withstand it to the death.\" * * * *\r\n\r\n          January 2, 1877, Rev. Dr. See continued his defense of\r\n          himself for letting a woman into his pulpit. Then the roll\r\n          was called for the views of the Presbytery. Dr. McIllvaine\r\n          said that the two sources of light, as he understood it,\r\n          were the teachings of the Lord and his disciples. The Lord\r\n          didn't select women for his twelve, and vacancies were not\r\n          filled by women. It wasn't a woman who was chosen to do\r\n          Paul's work. He was the chosen teacher of the church in that\r\n          and all succeeding ages, and he had said, \"I suffer not\r\n          women to teach, or to usurp authority in the church.\" Dr.\r\n          Brinsmade, who was the pastor of the Wickliffe Church before\r\n          Dr. See was called there, admitted that women could preach\r\n          well, but thought the Presbytery had better stick by the\r\n          divine command. Dr. Canfield also agreed with Paul. He loved\r\n          women and loved their work, but it seemed from the\r\n          experience of the world that God intended that the pulpit\r\n          should be the place for men. Such, at any rate, had been the\r\n          principle and the practice of the Presbyterian Church; and\r\n          if Brother See could not conform to its rules, he would say\r\n          to him, \"Go, brother; there are other churches in which you\r\n          can find a place.\" Dr. Canfield was called to order for that\r\n          addendum. Dr. Hutchings, of Orange, referred to the ancient\r\n          justification of slavery from the Bible, and in view of\r\n          honest differences of construction accepted by the church,\r\n          thought the question should be left to the discretion of\r\n          pastors and church-sessions. Rev. Jonathan F. Stearns,\r\n          pastor of the First Church, demurred to this and stood by\r\n          the Scripture text. Nine-tenths of the ladies of the church,\r\n          he said, would vote against preaching by women.\r\n\r\n          Rev. James E. Wilson, pastor of the South Park Church, said\r\n          that in churches where women had been permitted to preach,\r\n          they had lost ground. \"I have never heard a Quaker woman,\"\r\n          said he, \"preach a sermon worth three cents (laughter), and\r\n          yet I have heard the spirit move them to get up and speak at\r\n          most improper times and on most inopportune occasions, and\r\n          have heard them say most improper and impertinent things.\"\r\n          In the Methodist Church he did not believe that there were\r\n          over twenty-five women preachers, so the women were losing\r\n          ground, and not gaining. Even the woman suffragists, who\r\n          made so much noise a few years ago, had subsided, and he did\r\n          not believe there were a hundred agitators in the whole\r\n          country now. \"See,\" he said, \"where Brother See's argument\r\n          would carry him. Any woman that has the spirit upon her may\r\n          speak, and so, by and by, two or three women may walk up\r\n          into Brother See's pulpit and say,'Come down; it's our turn\r\n          now, we are moved by the spirit.' (Laughter). A woman's\r\n          voice was against her preaching; a man's voice came out with\r\n          a 'thud,' but a woman spoke soft and pleasing; however, here\r\n          were the plain words of the text, and any man that could\r\n          throw it overboard could throw over the doctrine of the\r\n          atonement. If a mother should teach her son from the pulpit\r\n          by preaching to him, thus disobeying the plain words of the\r\n          apostle, she must not be surprised if her son went contrary\r\n          to some other teaching of the apostle. But the fact was, the\r\n          women did not desire to preach; otherwise they would have\r\n          preached long ago. He rejoiced when that convention of\r\n          temperance women assembled in Newark, but he could not help\r\n          pitying their husbands and families away out in Chicago and\r\n          elsewhere. (Laughter).\r\n\r\n          Rev. Ferd. Smith, the pastor of the Second Church, said the\r\n          president of the Woman's Temperance Union had asked him if\r\n          they could have the use of the church, and he had said\r\n          \"yes\"; \"and,\" said Dr. Smith, \"I am glad that I did it, and\r\n          I am sorry that I was not there to hear the address; and\r\n          now, brethren, I am going to confess that I have sinned a\r\n          little in this matter of women preaching. Two or three years\r\n          ago I went and heard Miss Smiley preach. I had heard in the\r\n          morning--I won't mention his name--one of the most\r\n          distinguished men of the country preach a very able\r\n          sermon--a very long one, too. [Laughter.] I had heard in the\r\n          afternoon a doctor of divinity; I don't see him here now,\r\n          but I have seen him, and I won't mention his name; and I\r\n          heard Miss Smiley in the evening. It may be heresy to say\r\n          it, but I do think I was more fed that evening than I had\r\n          been by both the others; but I do not on that account say\r\n          that it is good for women to go, as a regular thing, into\r\n          the pulpit. If I had heard her a dozen times, I should not\r\n          have been so much moved. Woman-preaching may do for a little\r\n          time, but it won't do for a permanency. I heard at Old\r\n          Orchard, at a temperance convention, the most beautiful\r\n          argument I ever listened to, delivered with grace and\r\n          modesty and power. The words fell like dew upon the heart,\r\n          enriching it, and the speaker was Miss Willard; but for all\r\n          this, brethren, I do not approve of women preaching. [Great\r\n          laughter.] We must not, for the sake of a little good,\r\n          sacrifice a great principle.\" Dr. Pollock of Lyons Farms\r\n          wanted to shelter women, to prevent them from being talked\r\n          about as ministers are and criticised as ministers are; it\r\n          was for this that he would keep them out of the pulpit. Rev.\r\n          Drs. Findley and Prentiss de Neuve were in favor of\r\n          sustaining the charge. Rev. Dr. Haley contended that Brother\r\n          See ought not to be condemned, because he had not offended\r\n          against any law of the church. Drs. Seibert, Ballantine and\r\n          Hopwood spoke in favor of sustaining the charge. A vote of\r\n          16 to 12 found Rev. Dr. See guilty of violating the\r\n          Scriptures by allowing women to preach, and the case was\r\n          appealed to the General Assembly.\r\n\r\n     The General Assembly adopted the following report on this case:\r\n\r\n          The Rev. Isaac W. See, pastor of the Wickliffe Church,\r\n          Newark, N. J., was charged by Rev. Elijah R. Craven, D. D.,\r\n          with disobedience to the divinely enacted ordinance in\r\n          reference to the public speaking and teaching of women in\r\n          the churches as recorded in I Corinthians, xiv., 33-37, and\r\n          in I Timothy, ii., 11-13, in that twice on a specified\r\n          Sabbath, in the pulpit of his said church, at the usual time\r\n          of public service, he did introduce a woman, whom he\r\n          permitted and encouraged then and there publicly to preach\r\n          and teach.\r\n\r\n          The Presbytery of Newark sustained the charge, and from its\r\n          decision Mr. See appealed to the synod of New Jersey, which\r\n          refused by a decided vote to sustain the appeal, expressing\r\n          its judgment in a minute of which the following is a part:\r\n\r\n          In sustaining the Presbytery of Newark as against the appeal\r\n          of the Rev. I. M. See, the synod holds that the passages of\r\n          scripture referred to in the action of the Presbytery, do\r\n          prohibit the fulfilling by women of the offices of public\r\n          preachers in the regular assemblies of the church.\r\n\r\n          From this decision Mr. See has further appealed to the\r\n          General Assembly, which, having thereupon proceeded to issue\r\n          the appeal, and having fully heard the original parties and\r\n          members of the inferior judicatory, decided that the said\r\n          appeal from the synod of New Jersey be not sustained by the\r\n          following vote: To sustain, 85. To sustain in part, 71. Not\r\n          to sustain, 201.\r\n\r\n     From the following description by Mrs. Devereux Blake, we have\r\n     conclusive evidence of woman's capacity to govern under most\r\n     trying circumstances:\r\n\r\n          A certain little woman living in Jersey City has, from time\r\n          to time, occupied a portion of public consideration; this is\r\n          Mrs. Ericka C. Jones, for four years and a half warden of\r\n          the Hudson county jail, probably the only woman in the world\r\n          who holds such a position. Her history is briefly this: Some\r\n          seven years ago her husband obtained the appointment of\r\n          jailor at this institution, and moved to it with his bride.\r\n          From the time of their incoming a marked improvement in the\r\n          administration of the jail became apparent, which continued,\r\n          when, after two years, Mr. Jones was stricken down with\r\n          softening of the brain, which reduced him to a condition of\r\n          idiocy for six months before his death. When at last this\r\n          occurred, by unanimous vote of the board of freeholders the\r\n          woman who had really performed the duties of jailor was\r\n          appointed warden of Hudson county jail. All this has been a\r\n          matter of report in the papers, as well as the attempt to\r\n          oust her from the position, which was made last fall, when\r\n          certain male politicians wanted the place for some friend\r\n          and voter, and appealed to Attorney-General Vanetta, who\r\n          gave an opinion adverse to the lady's claims. Resolutions on\r\n          the subject were passed by various woman suffrage societies,\r\n          and anxious to see the subject of so much dispute, and hear\r\n          her story from her own lips, a party of ladies was made up\r\n          to call upon her.\r\n\r\n          Hudson-county jail stands in the same inclosure with the\r\n          court-house, a small, neatly-kept park, well shaded by fine\r\n          trees, and being on very high ground commands a view over\r\n          the North River and New York Bay. The building is a\r\n          substantial one of stone, with nothing of the repulsive\r\n          aspect of a jail about it. Asking for Mrs. Jones, we were at\r\n          once shown into the office. We had expected to see a woman\r\n          of middle age and somewhat stern aspect. Instead, we beheld\r\n          a pretty, young person, apparently not more than twenty-five\r\n          years old, with bright, black eyes, waving brown hair, good\r\n          features and plump figure. She was very neatly dressed and\r\n          pleasant in manner, making us cordially welcome. We were\r\n          conducted into the parlor and at once begged her to tell us\r\n          all about her case, which she did very clearly and\r\n          concisely. When she was left a widow with two little\r\n          children she had no idea that this place would be given her,\r\n          but it was tendered to her by unanimous vote of the board of\r\n          freeholders. At that time there were in jail three desperate\r\n          criminals, Proctor, Demsing and Foley, bank robbers, and\r\n          some persons feared that a woman could not hold them, but\r\n          they were safely transferred at the proper time from the\r\n          jail to the state-prison. \"And,\" she added, with a bright\r\n          smile, \"I never have lost a prisoner, which is more than\r\n          many men-jailors can say. Some of them tried to escape last\r\n          fall, but I had warning in time, sent for the police, and\r\n          the attempt was prevented.\"\r\n\r\n          \"And do you think there is any danger of your being turned\r\n          out?\" \"I don't know. I intend to remain in the place until\r\n          the end of my term, if possible, since as long as the effort\r\n          to dismiss me is based solely on the ground of my sex and\r\n          not of my incompetency, it ought justly to be resisted.\"\r\n          \"But Attorney-General Vanetta gave an adverse opinion as to\r\n          the legality of your appointment?\" \"Yes, but\r\n          ex-Attorney-General Robert Gilchrist, a very able lawyer,\r\n          has given an opinion in my favor, while Mr. Lippincott,\r\n          counsel of the board when I was appointed, also held that I\r\n          was eligible for the place.\"\r\n\r\n          She then went on to tell us some of the petty persecutions\r\n          and indirect measures Which have been resorted to in order\r\n          to induce her to resign, as her term of office will not\r\n          expire for two years. When her husband was given the\r\n          position, the allowance consisted of 40 cents a day for each\r\n          prisoner, 50 cents for each sick person, 25 cents for every\r\n          committal, and 12-1/2 cents for every discharge. The daily\r\n          allowance has been cut down from 40 to 25 cents, and all the\r\n          other allowances have been entirely done away with. She is,\r\n          therefore, at this moment running that jail on 25 cents a\r\n          day for each prisoner. Out of this sum she must pay for all\r\n          food, all salaries of assistant jailors, etc., all wages of\r\n          servants, and even the furniture of the place. She is\r\n          supplied with fuel and gas, but no stores of any\r\n          description. She has also had other annoyances. The payment\r\n          of money justly due has been opposed or delayed; and whereas\r\n          her husband was required to give bond for only $5,000, she\r\n          has been forced to give one for $10,000. She has also been\r\n          troubled by the visits of persons representing themselves to\r\n          be reporters of papers, who have wished to borrow money of\r\n          her, and failing in this, have printed disagreeable articles\r\n          about her. She has, of course, no salary whatever. \"However,\r\n          I do as well as I can with the money I receive,\" she said,\r\n          with that pleasant smile. \"And now would you like to see the\r\n          jail?\" * * * *\r\n\r\n          Ex-Attorney Gilchrist's opinion on her case is an able\r\n          indorsement of her position. He says, in the first place,\r\n          that as Attorney-General Vanetta's adverse view was not\r\n          given officially, it is not binding on the Board of\r\n          Freeholders, and then goes on to cite precedents. \"Alice\r\n          Stubbs, in 1787, was appointed overseer of the poor in the\r\n          county of Stafford, England, and the Court of King's Bench\r\n          sustained her in the office. A woman was appointed governor\r\n          of the work-house at Chelmsford, England, and the court held\r\n          it to be a good appointment. Lady Brangleton was appointed\r\n          keeper of the Gate-House jail in London. Lady Russell was\r\n          appointed keeper of the Castle of Dunnington. All these\r\n          cases are reported in _Stranges R._, as clearly establishing\r\n          the right and duty of woman to hold office. The case of Ann,\r\n          Countess of Pembroke, Dorsett and Montgomery, who was\r\n          sheriff of Westmoreland, is very well known.\" The opinion\r\n          winds up by saying: \"The argument that a woman is\r\n          incompetent to perform the duties of such an office is\r\n          doubly answered--first, by the array of cases in which it is\r\n          held that she is competent; second, by the resolution of the\r\n          board when Mrs. Jones was appointed, that she had for a long\r\n          time prior thereto actually kept the jail while her husband\r\n          was jailor.\" How this whole matter would be simplified if\r\n          women could vote and hold office, so that merit and not sex\r\n          should be the only qualification for any place.--_New York\r\n          Record, 1876._\r\n\r\n     The following incident shows not only what physical training will\r\n     do in giving a girl self-reliance in emergencies, but it shows\r\n     the nice sense of humor that grows out of conscious power with\r\n     which a girl can always take a presuming youth at disadvantage.\r\n     No doubt Miss McCosh, as a student in Princeton, could as easily\r\n     distance her compeers in science, philosophy and the languages,\r\n     as she did the dude on the highway. Why not open the doors of\r\n     that institution and let her make the experiment?\r\n\r\n          The distinguished president of Princeton College, Dr.\r\n          McCosh, has two daughters who are great walkers. They are in\r\n          the habit of going to Trenton and back, a distance of about\r\n          twenty miles, where they do their shopping. One day a dude\r\n          accosted Miss Bridget on the road, and said, in the usual\r\n          manner: \"Beg pardon, but may I walk with you?\" She replied,\r\n          \"Certainly,\" and quickened her pace a little. After the\r\n          first half-mile the masher began to gasp, and then, as she\r\n          passed on with a smile, he sat down panting on a mile-stone,\r\n          and mopped the perspiration from his brow.\r\n\r\n     At the sixteenth national convention, held in Washington, March,\r\n     1884, the State was well represented;[283] Mrs. Hanaford gave an\r\n     address on \"New Jersey as a Leader.\" In her letter to the\r\n     convention, Mrs. Hussey wrote:\r\n\r\n          An old gentleman, Aaron Burr Harrison, a resident of East\r\n          Orange, has just passed on to his long home, full of\r\n          years--eighty-eight--and with a good record. He told me\r\n          about his sister's voting in New jersey, when he was a\r\n          child--probably about 1807. The last time I took a petition\r\n          for woman suffrage to him, he signed it willingly, and his\r\n          daughter also.\r\n\r\n     February 12, 1884, a special committee of the New Jersey Assembly\r\n     granted a hearing[284] on the petition of Mrs. Celia B.\r\n     Whitehead, and 220 other citizens of Bloomfield, asking the\r\n     restoration of woman's right to vote; fully one-half of the\r\n     members of the Assembly were present. Mrs. Seagrove handed the\r\n     committee an ancient printed copy of the original constitution of\r\n     New Jersey, dated July 2, 1776. The name of James Seagrove, her\r\n     husband's grandfather, is endorsed upon it in his own\r\n     hand-writing. In the suffrage clause of this document the words\r\n     \"all inhabitants\" were substituted for those of \"male\r\n     freeholders\" in the provincial charter. Hence the constitution of\r\n     1776 gave suffrage to women and men of color. Mrs. Seagrove made\r\n     an appeal on behalf of the women of the State. Mr. Blackwell gave\r\n     a resume of the unconstitutional action of the legislature in its\r\n     depriving women of their right to vote. Mrs. Hanaford, in answer\r\n     to a question of the committee, claimed the right for women not\r\n     only to vote but to hold office; and instanced from her own\r\n     observation the need of women as police officers, and especially\r\n     as matrons in the police stations. The result of these appeals\r\n     may be seen in a paragraph from the Boston _Commonwealth_, a\r\n     paper in hearty sympathy:\r\n\r\n          In the lower House of the New Jersey legislature a\r\n          Democratic member recently moved that the word \"male\" be\r\n          stricken from the constitution of the State. After some\r\n          positive discussion a non-partisan vote of 27 to 24 defeated\r\n          the motion. This occurrence, it is to be observed, is\r\n          chronicled of one of the most conservative States in the\r\n          Union. The arguments used on both sides were not new or\r\n          remarkable. But the vote was very close. If such a measure\r\n          could in so conservative a State be nearly carried, we can\r\n          have reasonable hope of its favorable reception, in more\r\n          radical sections. In New Jersey we did not expect success\r\n          for the resolution proposed. The favorable votes really\r\n          surprised us. We do not mistake the omen. Gradually the\r\n          point of woman's responsibility is being conceded. The\r\n          arbitrary lines now drawn politically and socially are\r\n          without reason. Indeed, one of the members of the New Jersey\r\n          Assembly called attention to the fact that to grant suffrage\r\n          now would not be the conferring of a new gift on women, but\r\n          only a restoration of rights exercised in colonial times.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[274] See Vol. I., page 447.\r\n\r\n[275] Mrs. Pryor lived formerly in Waterloo, New York. She was\r\npresent at the first convention at Seneca Falls, and sustained the\r\ndemand for woman suffrage with earnest sympathy.

He was a Quaker by birth and\r\nconviction, and a printer, appointed by King George III. for the\r\nprovince of New Jersey. He printed many valuable books, almanacs,\r\nBibles, revised laws, government money, and a weekly paper, _The\r\nNew Jersey Gazette_. In making his will he so divided his property\r\nthat each of his six daughters received twice the sum that he gave\r\nto each of the seven sons. This he explained by saying that the\r\nlatter could go into business and support themselves, but his\r\ndaughters must have enough to live upon, if they chose to remain\r\nsingle; he did not wish them to be forced to marry for a support.\r\n\r\n[282] In the audience were several advocates of woman suffrage,\r\nprobably there to take observations of the manner in which\r\nChristian clergymen conduct their meetings. This class of men had\r\nbeen so severe in their criticisms of woman suffrage conventions\r\nthat we hoped to learn lessons of wisdom from the dignity,\r\nrefinement and parliamentary order of their proceedings.

To the women of Cleveland is justly due the honor of\r\norganizing the first soldiers' aid society, a meeting being called\r\nfor this purpose five days after the fall of Fort Sumter. Through\r\nthe influence of Mrs. Mendenhall were inaugurated the great\r\nsanitary fairs[285] there, and by her untiring energy and that of\r\nthe ladies who labored with her, many of our brave soldiers were\r\nrestored to health. Mrs. Annie L. Quinby writes:\r\n\r\n     In the autumn of 1867 Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony made a\r\n     lecturing tour through Ohio and roused popular thought on the\r\n     question of suffrage. March 28, 1868, the Cincinnati Equal Rights\r\n     Association[286] was formed, auxiliary to the National Society,\r\n     of which Lucretia Mott was president. April 7, 1869, Mrs. Ryder\r\n     called the attention of the meeting to a resolution offered by\r\n     Mr. Gordon in the State legislature, to amend the constitution so\r\n     as to strike out the word male, proposing that at the October\r\n     election, \"in all precincts in the State, there shall be a\r\n     separate poll, at which all white women over 21 years of age\r\n     shall be permitted to vote, and if the votes cast be a majority\r\n     of all the white women, the constitution shall be amended.\" Mrs.\r\n     Ryder seemed to think the proposition a very fair one, or\r\n     intended by the mover to give the women, if they wanted to vote,\r\n     the opportunity of saying so on this amendment to the\r\n     constitution. Mrs. Blangy also concurred in this view of the\r\n     subject. Mrs. Quinby expressed her indignation at the\r\n     proposition, saying she believed its passage by the legislature\r\n     would be detrimental to the cause, both on account of its\r\n     provisions and the mode of accomplishing the object of the\r\n     resolution. As it stood, it could but fail, as women were not\r\n     prepared for it at the present time, and the proposition was not\r\n     that the majority of votes cast should settle the question, but\r\n     that the number cast in favor of it should be a majority of all\r\n     the women in the State 21 years of age. She therefore thought we\r\n     should express our decided disapproval of this amendment. Mrs.\r\n     Leavitt also declared her opposition to this resolution,\r\n     believing it to have been offered for the sole purpose of\r\n     stalling the woman suffrage movement for years to come. She\r\n     thought this association should express its decided opposition to\r\n     this resolution. Mrs. Butterwood and others followed in the same\r\n     strain, and it was finally agreed unanimously that the\r\n     corresponding secretary be instructed to write to the mover of\r\n     the resolution, expressing disapprobation of some of the terms of\r\n     the amendment, with the hope that it will not pass in the form\r\n     offered, and politely requesting Mr. Gordon to define his\r\n     position as the resolution is susceptible of being construed both\r\n     for and against equal rights.\r\n\r\n     At a meeting held April 21, 1869, delegates[287] were elected to\r\n     attend the May anniversary of the American Equal Rights\r\n     Association in New York. Mrs. Margaret V. Longley was placed on\r\n     the executive committee of the National Association to represent\r\n     Ohio. On her return from New York she joined with the Cincinnati\r\n     Equal Rights Society in a call for a convention in Pike's Hall,\r\n     September 15, 16, 1869, for the organization of an Ohio State\r\n     Society.[288] Mrs. Longley presided; the audiences were large and\r\n     enthusiastic;[289] the press of the city gave extended reports.\r\n     Murat Halstead, editor of the Cincinnati _Commercial_, sent the\r\n     following reply to his invitation:\r\n\r\n                                   CINCINNATI, July 28, 1869.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. M. V. LONGLEY: _Dear Madam_--I cannot sign your call\r\n          for a woman suffrage convention, for I do not feel a serious\r\n          interest in the subject. That there are woman's wrongs that\r\n          the law-makers should right, I believe. For instance, I\r\n          think married women should hold property independently; that\r\n          they should be able to save and enjoy the fruits of their\r\n          own industry; and that they should not be absolutely in the\r\n          power of lazy, dissipated or worthless husbands. But I\r\n          cannot see clearly how the possession of the ballot would\r\n          help women in the reform indicated. If, however, a majority\r\n          of the women of Ohio should signify by means proving their\r\n          active interest in the subject that they wanted to acquire\r\n          the right of suffrage, I don't think I would offer\r\n          opposition.\r\n\r\n                                             M. HALSTEAD.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Livermore and Miss Anthony made some amusing strictures on\r\n     Mr. Halstead's letter, which called out laughter and cheers from\r\n     the audience. April 27 and 28, 1870, a mass-meeting was held in\r\n     Dayton. Describing the occasion, Miss Sallie Joy, in a letter to\r\n     a Boston paper, says:\r\n\r\n          The west is evidently wide awake on the suffrage question.\r\n          The people are working with zeal almost unknown in the East,\r\n          except to the more immediately interested, who are making a\r\n          life-labor of the cause. The two days' convention at Dayton\r\n          was freighted with interest. Earnest women were there from\r\n          all parts of the State. They of the west do not think much\r\n          of distances, and consequently nearly every town of note was\r\n          represented. Cleveland sent her women from the borders of\r\n          the lake; Cincinnati sent hers from the banks of the Ohio;\r\n          Columbus, Springfield, Toledo and Sydney were represented.\r\n          Not merely the leaders were there, but those who were\r\n          comparatively new to the cause; all in earnest,--young girls\r\n          in the first flush of youth, a new light dawning on their\r\n          lives and shining through their eyes, waiting, reaching\r\n          longing hands for this new gift to womanhood,--mothers on\r\n          the down-hill side of life, quietly but gladly expectant of\r\n          the good that was coming so surely to crown all these human\r\n          lives. Most of the speakers were western women--Mrs. Cutler,\r\n          Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Stewart, of Ohio, and Miss Boynton, of\r\n          Indiana. The East sent our own Susan B. Anthony, and Mrs.\r\n          Livermore of Boston. Like every other convention, it grew\r\n          more interesting the longer it continued, and just when the\r\n          speakers were so tired that they were glad the work for the\r\n          time was done, the listeners, like a whole army of Oliver\r\n          Twists, were crying for more. They are likely to have\r\n          more--a great deal more--before the work is done completely,\r\n          for it is evident the leaders don't intend to let the thing\r\n          rest where it is, but to push it forward to final success.\r\n          From the list of resolutions considered and adopted, I send\r\n          the following:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That as the Democratic party has long since\r\n          abolished the political aristocracy of wealth; and the\r\n          Republican party has now abolished the aristocracy of race;\r\n          so the true spirit of Republican Democracy of the present,\r\n          demands the abolition of the political aristocracy of sex.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That as the government of the United States has,\r\n          by the adoption of the fifteenth amendment, admitted the\r\n          theory that one man cannot define the rights and duties of\r\n          another man, so we demand the adoption of a sixteenth\r\n          amendment on the same principle, that one sex cannot define\r\n          the rights and duties of another sex.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That we rejoice in the noble action of the men\r\n          of Wyoming, by which the right of suffrage has been granted\r\n          to the women of that territory.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That we feel justly proud of the action of those\r\n          representatives of the General Assembly of Ohio, who have\r\n          endeavored to secure an amendment to the State constitution,\r\n          striking out the word \"male\" from that instrument.\r\n\r\nIt is rather remarkable that in a State which so early established\r\ntwo colleges admitting women--Oberlin in 1834, and Antioch in\r\n1853--any intelligent women should have been found at so late a\r\ndate as April 15, 1870, to protest against the right of\r\nself-government for themselves, yet such is the case, as the\r\nfollowing protest shows:\r\n\r\n     We acknowledge no inferiority to men. We claim to have no less\r\n     ability to perform the duties which God has imposed upon us than\r\n     they have to perform those imposed upon them. We believe that God\r\n     has wisely and well adapted each sex to the proper performance of\r\n     the duties of each. We believe our trusts to be as important and\r\n     as sacred as any that exist on earth. We feel that our present\r\n     duties fill up the whole measure of our time and abilities; and\r\n     that they are such as none but ourselves can perform. Their\r\n     importance requires us to protest against all efforts to compel\r\n     us to assume those obligations which cannot be separated from\r\n     suffrage; but which cannot be performed by us without the\r\n     sacrifice of the highest interests of our families and of\r\n     society. It is our fathers, brothers, husbands and sons, who\r\n     represent us at the ballot-box. Our fathers and brothers love us.\r\n     Our husbands are our choice, and one with us. Our sons are what\r\n     _we_ make them. We are content that they represent us in the\r\n     corn-field, the battle-field, at the ballot-box and the jury-box,\r\n     and we them, in the church, the school-room, at the fireside and\r\n     at the cradle; believing our representation, even at the\r\n     ballot-box, to be thus more full and impartial than it could\r\n     possibly be, were all women allowed to vote. We do, therefore\r\n     respectively protest against legislation to establish woman\r\n     suffrage in Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe above paper, signed by more than one hundred ladies of Lorain\r\ncounty, was presented, March 14, 1870, to the legislature assembled\r\nat Columbus. Mrs. Sarah Knowles Bolton, criticising the Oberlin\r\nprotestants, said:\r\n\r\n     That so many signed is not strange, because the non-suffrage side\r\n     is the popular one at present. Years hence, when it shall be\r\n     customary for women to vote, it is questionable whether the lady\r\n     who drew up that document would have many supporters.\r\n\r\n     If \"we are not inferior to men,\" we must have as clear opinions\r\n     and as good judgment as they. To say, then, that we are not\r\n     capable of judging of political questions, is untrue. To say that\r\n     we are not interested in such things is absurd, for who can be\r\n     more anxious for good laws and good law-makers than women, who,\r\n     for the most part, have sons and daughters in this whirlpool of\r\n     temptation, called social and business life. If we are too\r\n     ignorant to have an opinion, the fault lies at our own door.\r\n\r\n     These ladies reason upon the premises that the duties imposed\r\n     upon us as we find them in this nineteenth century, are the\r\n     duties, conditions, and relations established of God. Two things\r\n     we do certainly find in the Bible with regard to this matter;\r\n     that women are to bear children, and men to earn bread. The first\r\n     duty we believe has been confined entirely to the female sex, but\r\n     the male sex have not kept the other in all cases. If anybody has\r\n     belonged for any considerable time to a benevolent institution,\r\n     he has ascertained that women sometimes are obliged to earn bread\r\n     and bear children also. A century or two ago, when women seldom\r\n     thought of writing books, or being physicians or lawyers,\r\n     professors or teachers, or doing anything but housework, probably\r\n     they thought, as the ladies of Lorain county do to-day, they were\r\n     in the blessed noonday of woman's enlightenment and happiness.\r\n     Their husbands, very likely, needed something of the same\r\n     companionship as the men of the present, but it was unpopular for\r\n     girls to attend school. If these ladies, after careful study and\r\n     thought, believe that woman suffrage will work evil in the land,\r\n     they ought to say that, rather than base it upon lack of time.\r\n     The enfranchisement of 15,000,000 women will be a balance of\r\n     power for good or evil that will need looking after. As for our\r\n     representing men at the fireside, I think it a great deal\r\n     pleasanter that they be there in person. Nothing is more blessed\r\n     than the home circle, and here I think if husbands were not so\r\n     often represented by their wives, while they are absent evening\r\n     after evening on \"important business,\" the condition of things\r\n     would be improved. If the ladies aforesaid cannot vote without\r\n     the highest interests of their families being sacrificed, they\r\n     ought to be allowed to remain in peace. I am glad they made this\r\n     protest, not only because this is a country where honest views\r\n     ought to be expressed, but because agitation pushes forward\r\n     reform. I am glad that nearly half of our representatives were in\r\n     favor of submitting this question to the women of the State, and\r\n     that our interests were so ably defended by a talented\r\n     representative from our own district. I do not think, however, by\r\n     submitting it to the women, they would get a correct expression\r\n     upon the subject. A good many would vote for suffrage, a few\r\n     against it, and thousands would be afraid to vote. If it is\r\n     granted, I do not suppose all women will vote immediately. Many\r\n     prejudices will first have to give way. If women vote what they\r\n     wish to vote, and there is no disorderly conduct at the polls in\r\n     consequence, and no general disorder in the body politic, I do\r\n     not see any objection to the voting being continued from year to\r\n     year.\r\n\r\n     When women like Miss Jones of our city, now in California, take a\r\n     few more professorships in a university over half-a-hundred\r\n     competitors, write a few more libraries, show themselves capable\r\n     of solving great questions, become ornaments to their\r\n     professions, it will seem more absurd for them not to be\r\n     enfranchised than it does now for them to be so.\r\n\r\nHon. J. M. Ashley, of Toledo, in a speech on the floor of congress,\r\nJune 1, 1868, said:\r\n\r\n     I want citizenship and suffrage to be synonymous. To put the\r\n     question beyond the power of States to withhold it, I propose the\r\n     amendment to article fourteen, now submitted. A large number of\r\n     Republicans who concede that the qualifications of an elector\r\n     ought to be the same in every State, and that it is more properly\r\n     a national than a State question, do not believe congress has the\r\n     power under our present constitution to enact a law conferring\r\n     suffrage in the States, nevertheless they are ready and willing\r\n     to vote for such an amendment to the constitution as shall make\r\n     citizenship and suffrage uniform throughout the nation. For this\r\n     purpose I have added to the proposed amendment for the election\r\n     of president a section on suffrage, to which I invite special\r\n     attention.\r\n\r\n     This is the third or fourth time I have brought forward a\r\n     proposition on suffrage substantially like the one just presented\r\n     to the House. I do so again because I believe the question of\r\n     citizenship suffrage one which ought to be met and settled now.\r\n     Important and all-absorbing as many questions are which now press\r\n     themselves upon our consideration, to me no one is so vitally\r\n     important as this. Tariffs, taxation, and finance ought not to be\r\n     permitted to supersede a question affecting the peace and\r\n     personal security of every citizen, and, I may add, the peace and\r\n     security of the nation. No party can be justified in withholding\r\n     the ballot from any citizen of mature years, native or foreign\r\n     born, except such as are _non compos_ or are guilty of infamous\r\n     crimes; nor can they justly confer this great privilege upon one\r\n     class of citizens to the exclusion of another class.\r\n\r\nThe _Revolution_ of March 19, 1868, said:\r\n\r\n     Notwithstanding the most determined hostility to the demands of\r\n     the age for female physicians, institutions for their educational\r\n     preparation for professional responsibilities are rapidly\r\n     increasing. The ball first began to move in the United\r\n     States,[290] and now a female medical college is in successful\r\n     operation in London, where the favored monopolizers of physic and\r\n     surgery were resolved to keep out all new ideas in their line by\r\n     acts of parliament. But the ice-walls of opposition have melted\r\n     away, and even in Russia a woman has graduated with high medical\r\n     honors.\r\n\r\nThe following statistics from Thomas Wentworth Higginson settle\r\nmany popular objections to a collegiate education for women:\r\n\r\n     GRADUATES OF ANTIOCH COLLEGE.--In a paper read before the Social\r\n     Science Association in the spring of 1874 I pointed out the\r\n     presumption to be, that if a desire for knowledge was implanted\r\n     in the minds of women, they had also as a class the physical\r\n     capacity to gratify it; and that therefore the burden of proof\r\n     lay on those who opposed such education, on physiological\r\n     grounds, to collect facts in support of their position. In\r\n     criticising Dr. Clarke's book, \"Sex in Education,\" I called\r\n     attention to the fact that he has made no attempt to do this, but\r\n     has merely given a few detached cases, whose scientific value is\r\n     impaired by the absence of all proof whether they stand for few\r\n     or many. We need many facts and a cautious induction; not merely\r\n     a few facts and a sweeping induction. I am now glad to put on\r\n     record a tabular view[291] of the graduates of Antioch, with\r\n     special reference to their physical health and condition; the\r\n     facts being collected and mainly arranged by Professor J. B.\r\n     Weston of Antioch--who has been connected with that institution\r\n     from its foundation--with the aid of Mrs. Weston and Rev. Olympia\r\n     Brown, both graduates of the college. For the present form of the\r\n     table, however, I alone am responsible.\r\n\r\n     It appears that of the 41 graduates, ranging from the year 1857\r\n     to 1873, no fewer than 36 are now living. Of these the health of\r\n     11 is reported as \"very good\"; 19 \"good\"; making 30 in all; 1 is\r\n     reported as \"fair\"; 1 \"uncertain\"; 1 \"not good,\" and 3 \"unknown.\"\r\n     Of the 41 graduates, 30 are reported as married and 11 are\r\n     single, five of these last having graduated within three years.\r\n     Of the 30 married, 24 have children, numbering 48 or 49 in all.\r\n     Of the 6 childless, 3 are reported as very recently married; one\r\n     died a few months after marriage, and the facts in the other\r\n     cases are not given. Thirty-four of the forty-one have taught\r\n     since graduated, and I agree with Professor Weston that teaching\r\n     is as severe a draft on the constitution as study. Taking these\r\n     facts as a whole, I do not see how the most earnest advocate of\r\n     higher education could ask for a more encouraging exhibit; and I\r\n     submit the case without argument, so far as this pioneer\r\n     experiment at coeducation is concerned. If any man seriously\r\n     believes that his non-collegiate relatives are in better physical\r\n     condition than this table shows, I advise him to question\r\n     forty-one of them and tabulate the statistics obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the following editorial in the _Woman's Journal_ Mr. Higginson\r\npursues the opposition still more closely, and answers their\r\nfrivolous objections:\r\n\r\n     I am surprised to find that Professor W.S. Tyler of Amherst\r\n     College, in his paper on \"The Higher Education of Woman,\" in\r\n     _Scribner's Monthly_ for February, repeats the unfair statements\r\n     of President Eliot of Harvard, in regard to Oberlin College. The\r\n     fallacy and incorrectness of those statements were pointed out on\r\n     the spot by several, and were afterwards thoroughly shown by\r\n     President Fairchild of Oberlin; yet Professor Tyler repeats them\r\n     all. He asserts that there has been a great falling off in the\r\n     number of students in that college; he entirely ignores the\r\n     important fact of the great multiplication of colleges which\r\n     admit women; and he implies, if he does not assert, that the\r\n     separate ladies' course at Oberlin has risen as a substitute for\r\n     the regular college course. His words are these, the italics\r\n     being my own:\r\n\r\n          In Oberlin, where the experiment has been tried under the\r\n          most favorable circumstances, it has proved a failure so far\r\n          as the regular college course is concerned. The number of\r\n          young women in that course, instead of increasing with the\r\n          prosperity of the institution, _has diminished, so that it\r\n          now averages only two or three to a class_. The rest pursue\r\n          a different curriculum, live in a separate dormitory, and\r\n          study by themselves in a course of their own, reciting,\r\n          indeed, with the young men, and by way of reciprocity and in\r\n          true womanly compassion, allowing some of them to sit at\r\n          their table in the dining-hall, but yet constituting\r\n          substantially a female seminary, or, if you please, a\r\n          woman's college in the university.--_Scribner, February,\r\n          page 457._\r\n\r\n     Now, it was distinctly stated by President Fairchild last summer,\r\n     that this \"different curriculum\" was the course originally marked\r\n     out for women, and that the regular college course was an\r\n     after-thought. This disposes of the latter part of Professor\r\n     Tyler's statement. I revert, therefore, to his main statement,\r\n     that \"the number of young women in the collegiate course has\r\n     diminished, so that it now averages only two or three to a\r\n     class.\" Any reader would suppose his meaning to be that taking\r\n     one year with another, and comparing later years with the early\r\n     years of Oberlin, there has been a diminution of women. What is\r\n     the fact? The Oberlin College triennial catalogue of 1872 lies\r\n     before me, and I have taken the pains to count and tabulate the\r\n     women graduated in different years, during the thirty-two years\r\n     after 1841, when they began to be graduated there. Dividing them\r\n     into decennial periods, I find the numbers to be as follows:\r\n     1841-1850, thirty-two women were graduated; 1851-1860, seventeen\r\n     women were graduated; 1861-1870, forty women were graduated. From\r\n     this it appears that during the third decennial period there was\r\n     not only no diminution, but actually a higher average than\r\n     before. During the first period the classes averaged 3.2 women;\r\n     during the second period 1.7 women, and during the third period 4\r\n     women. Or if, to complete the exhibit, we take in the two odd\r\n     classes at the end, and make the third period consist of twelve\r\n     classes, the average will still be 3.8, and will be larger than\r\n     either of the previous periods. Or if, disregarding the even\r\n     distribution of periods, we take simply the last ten years, the\r\n     average will be 3.1. Moreover, during the first period there was\r\n     one class (1842) which contained no women at all; and during the\r\n     second period there were three such classes (1852-3, 7); while\r\n     during the third period every class has had at least one woman.\r\n\r\n     It certainly would not have been at all strange if there had been\r\n     a great falling off in the number of graduates of Oberlin. At the\r\n     outset it had the field to itself. Now the census gives\r\n     fifty-five \"colleges\" for women, besides seventy-seven which\r\n     admit both sexes. Many of these are inferior to Oberlin, no\r\n     doubt, but some rose rapidly to a prestige far beyond this\r\n     pioneer institution. With Cornell University on the one side, and\r\n     the University of Michigan on the other--to say nothing of minor\r\n     institutions--the wonder is that Oberlin could have held its own\r\n     at all. Yet the largest class of women it ever graduated\r\n     (thirteen) was so late as 1865, and if the classes since then\r\n     \"average but two or three,\" so did the classes for several years\r\n     before that date. Professor Tyler knows very well that classes\r\n     fluctuate in every college, and that a decennial period is the\r\n     least by which the working of any system can be tested. Tried by\r\n     this test, the alleged diminution assumes a very different\r\n     aspect. If, however, there were a great decline at Oberlin, it\r\n     would simply show a transfer of students to other colleges, since\r\n     neither Professor Tyler nor President Eliot will deny that the\r\n     total statistics of colleges show a rapid increase in the number\r\n     of women.\r\n\r\n     Moreover, I confess that my confidence in Professor Tyler's sense\r\n     of accuracy is greatly impaired by these assertions about\r\n     Oberlin, and also by his statement, which I must call reckless,\r\n     at least, in regard to the inferiority in truth, purity and\r\n     virtue of those women who seek the suffrage. He asserts (page\r\n     456) that \"women--women generally--the truest, purest and best of\r\n     the sex--do not wish for the right of suffrage.\" Now, if the\r\n     women who oppose suffrage are truest, purest and best, the women\r\n     who advocate it must plainly be inferior at all these points; and\r\n     that is an assertion which not only these women themselves, but\r\n     their brothers, husbands and sons are certainly entitled to\r\n     resent. Mr. Tyler has a perfect right to argue for his own views,\r\n     for or against suffrage, but he has no right to copy the Oriental\r\n     imprecation, and say to his opponents, \"May the grave of your\r\n     mother be defiled!.\" He claims that he holds official relations\r\n     to one \"woman's college,\" one \"female seminary\" and one \"young\r\n     ladies' institute.\" Will it conduce to the moral training of\r\n     those who enter those institutions that their officers set them\r\n     the example of impugning the purity and virtue of those who\r\n     differ in opinion from themselves?\r\n\r\n     But supposing Professor Tyler not to be bound by the usual bonds\r\n     of courtesy or of justice, he is at least bound by the\r\n     consistency of his own position. Thus, he goes out of his way to\r\n     compliment Mrs. Somerville and Miss Mitchell. Both these ladies\r\n     are identified with the claim for suffrage. He lauds \"Uncle Tom's\r\n     Cabin,\" but Mrs. Stowe has written almost as ably for the\r\n     enfranchisement of woman as for the freedom of the blacks. He\r\n     praises the \"sacramental host of authoresses,\" who, he says,\r\n     \"will move on with ever-growing power, overthrowing oppression,\r\n     restraining vice and crime, reforming morals and manners,\r\n     purifying public sentiment, revolutionizing business, society and\r\n     government, till every yoke is broken and all nations are won to\r\n     the truth.\" But it has been again and again shown that the\r\n     authoresses of America are, with but two or three exceptions, in\r\n     favor of woman suffrage, and, therefore, instead of being\r\n     \"sacramental,\" do not even belong to Professor Tyler's class of\r\n     \"wisest, truest and best.\" He thus selects for compliment on one\r\n     page the very women whom he has traduced on another. His own\r\n     witnesses testify against him. It is a pity that such phrases of\r\n     discourtesy and unfairness should disfigure an essay which in\r\n     many respects says good words for women, recommends that they\r\n     should study Greek, and says, in closing, that their elevation\r\n     \"is at once the measure and the means of the elevation of\r\n     mankind.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1884 an effort was made to exclude women from\r\nAdelbert College. We give an account thereof from the pen of Mrs.\r\nSarah Knowles Bolton, published in the _English Woman's Review_ of\r\nJanuary, 1885:\r\n\r\n     DEAR EDITOR: The city of Cleveland has been stirred for weeks on\r\n     this question of woman's higher education. Western Reserve\r\n     College, founded in 1826, at Hudson, was moved to Cleveland in\r\n     1874, because of a gift of $100,000 from Mr. Amasa Stone, with\r\n     the change of name to Adelbert College, in memory of an only son.\r\n     A few young women had been students since 1873. In Cleveland,\r\n     about twenty young ladies availed themselves of such admirable\r\n     home privileges. Their scholarship was excellent--higher than\r\n     that of the young men. They were absent from exercises only half\r\n     as much as the men. Their conduct was above reproach. A short\r\n     time since the faculty, except the president, Dr. Carroll Cutler,\r\n     petitioned the board of trustees to discontinue coeducation at\r\n     the college, for the assumed reasons that girls require different\r\n     training from boys, never \"identical\" education; that it is\r\n     trying to their health to recite before young men; \"the strain\r\n     upon the nervous system from mortifying mistakes and serious\r\n     corrections is to many young ladies a cruel additional burden\r\n     laid upon them in the course of study\"; \"that the provision we\r\n     offer to girls is not the best, and is even dangerous\"; that\r\n     \"where women are admitted, the college becomes second or\r\n     third-rate, and that, worst of all, young men will be deterred\r\n     from coming to this college by the presence of ladies.\" An\r\n     \"annex\" was recommended, not with college degrees, but a\r\n     subordinate arrangement with \"diploma examinations, so far and so\r\n     fast as the resources of the college shall allow.\"\r\n\r\n     As soon as the subject became known, the newspapers of the city\r\n     took up the question. As the public furnishes the means and the\r\n     students for every college, the public were vitally interested.\r\n     Ministers preached about it, and they, with doctors and lawyers,\r\n     wrote strong articles, showing that no \"annex\" was desired; that\r\n     parents wished thorough, high, self-reliant education for their\r\n     daughters as for their sons; that health was not injured by the\r\n     embarrassment (?) of reciting before young men; that young men\r\n     had not been deterred from going to Ann Arbor, Oberlin, Cornell,\r\n     and other institutions where there are young women; that it was\r\n     unjust to make girls go hundreds of miles away to Vassar or Smith\r\n     or Wellesley, when boys were provided with the best education at\r\n     their very doors; that, with over half the colleges of this\r\n     country admitting women, with the colleges of Italy, Switzerland,\r\n     Sweden, Holland and France throwing open their doors to women,\r\n     for Adelbert College to shut them out, would be a step backward\r\n     in civilization.\r\n\r\n     The women of the city took up the matter, and several thousands\r\n     of our best names were obtained to a petition, asking that girls\r\n     be retained members of the college; judges and leading persons\r\n     gladly signed. The trustees met November 7, 1884. The whole city\r\n     eagerly waited the result. The chairman of the committee, Hon. I.\r\n     W. Chamberlain of Columbus, who had been opposed to coeducation\r\n     at first, from the favorable reports received by him from\r\n     colleges all over the country, had become a thorough convert, and\r\n     the report was able and convincing.\r\n\r\n     President Angell of Michigan University, where there are 1,500\r\n     students, wrote: \"Women were admitted here under the pressure of\r\n     public sentiment against the wishes of most of the professors.\r\n     But I think no professor now regrets it, or would favor the\r\n     exclusion of women. We made no solitary modification of our rules\r\n     or requirements. The women did not become hoydenish; they did not\r\n     fail in their studies; they did not break down in health; they\r\n     have been graduated in all departments; they have not been\r\n     inferior in scholarship to the men. We count the experiment here\r\n     successful.\"\r\n\r\n     Galusha Anderson, president of Chicago University, wrote: \"Our\r\n     only law here is that the students shall act as gentlemen and\r\n     ladies. They mingle freely together, just as they do in society,\r\n     as I think God intended that they should, and the effect in all\r\n     respects is good. I have never had the slightest trouble from the\r\n     association of the sexes.\"\r\n\r\n     Chancellor Manatt of Nebraska University, for four years engaged\r\n     in university work at Yale, in answer to the questions as to\r\n     whether boys would be driven away from the institution, replied:\r\n     \"This question sounds like a joke in this longitude. As well say\r\n     a girl's being born into a family turns the boys out of doors. It\r\n     rather strengthens the home attraction. So in the university. I\r\n     believe there is not a professor or student here who would not,\r\n     for good and solid reasons, fight for the system.\"\r\n\r\n     President Warren of Boston University, lately the recipient of,\r\n     L200,000, wrote: \"The only opponents of coeducation I have ever\r\n     known are persons who know nothing about it practically, and\r\n     whose difficulties are all speculative and imaginary. Men are\r\n     more manly and women more womanly when concerted in a wholly\r\n     human society than when educated in a half-human one.\"\r\n\r\n     President White of Cornell wrote: \"I regard the 'annex' for women\r\n     in our colleges as a mere make-shift and step in the progress\r\n     toward the full admission of women to all college classes, and I\r\n     think that this is a very general view among men who have given\r\n     unprejudiced thought to the subject. Having now gone through one\r\n     more year, making twelve in all since women were admitted, I do\r\n     not hesitate to say that I believe their presence here is good\r\n     for us in every respect.\"\r\n\r\n     Professor Moses Coit Tyler of Cornell said: \"My observation has\r\n     been that under the joint system the tone of college life has\r\n     grown more earnest, more courteous and refined, less flippant and\r\n     cynical. The women are usually among the very best scholars, and\r\n     lead instead of drag, and their lapses from good health are\r\n     rather, yes, decidedly, less numerous than those alleged by the\r\n     men. There is a sort of young man who thinks it not quite the\r\n     thing, you know, to be in a college where women are; and he goes\r\n     away, if he can, and I am glad to have him do so. The vacuum he\r\n     causes is not a large one, and his departure is more than made up\r\n     by the arrival in his stead of a more robust and manlier sort.\"\r\n\r\n     The only objectors to coeducation were from those colleges which\r\n     had never tried it; President Porter of Yale thought it a\r\n     suitable method for post-graduate classes, and President Seeley\r\n     for a course of \"lower grade\" than Amherst.\r\n\r\n     President Cutler of Adelbert College made an able report, showing\r\n     that the progress of the age is towards coeducation. Only\r\n     fifty-three Protestant colleges, founded since 1830, exclude\r\n     women; while 156 coeducational institutions have been established\r\n     since that date.\r\n\r\n     Some of the trustees thought it desirable to imitate Yale,[292]\r\n     and others felt that _they_ knew what studies are desirable for\r\n     woman better than she knew herself! When the vote was taken, to\r\n     their honor be it said, it was twelve to six, or two to one, in\r\n     favor of coeducation. The girls celebrated this just and manly\r\n     decision by a banquet.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of the women's crusade at this time (1874) in Ohio\r\ncreated immense excitement, not only throughout that State, but it\r\nwas the topic for the pulpit and the press all over the nation.\r\nThose identified with the woman suffrage movement, while deeply\r\ninterested in the question of temperance, had no sympathy with what\r\nthey felt to be a desecration of womanhood and of the religious\r\nelement in woman. They felt that the fitting place for petitions\r\nand appeals was in the halls of legislation, to senators and\r\ncongressmen, rather than rumsellers and drunkards in the dens of\r\nvice and the public thoroughfares. It was pitiful to see the faith\r\nof women in God's power to effect impossibilities. Like produces\r\nlike in the universe of matter and mind, and so long as women\r\nconsent to make licentious, drunken men the fathers of their\r\nchildren, no power in earth or heaven can save the race from these\r\ntwin vices. The following letter from Miriam M. Cole makes some\r\ngood points on this question:\r\n\r\n     If the \"woman's war against whisky\" had been inaugurated by the\r\n     woman suffrage party, its aspect, in the eyes of newspapers,\r\n     would be different from what it now is. If Lucy Stone had set the\r\n     movement on foot, it would have been so characteristic of her!\r\n     What more could one expect from such a disturber of public peace?\r\n     She, who has no instinctive scruples against miscellaneous crowds\r\n     at the polls, might be expected to visit saloons and piously\r\n     serenade their owners, until patience ceases to be a virtue. But\r\n     for women who are so pressed with domestic cares that they have\r\n     no time to vote; for women who shun notoriety so much that they\r\n     are unwilling to ask permission to vote; for women who believe\r\n     that men are quite capable of managing State and municipal\r\n     affairs without their interference; for them to have set on foot\r\n     the present crusade, how queer! Their singing, though charged\r\n     with a moral purpose, and their prayers, though directed to a\r\n     specific end, do not make their warfare a whit more feminine, nor\r\n     their situation more attractive. A woman knocking out the head of\r\n     a whisky barrel with an ax, to the tune of Old Hundred, is not\r\n     the ideal woman sitting on a sofa, dining on strawberries and\r\n     cream, and sweetly warbling, \"The Rose that All are Praising.\"\r\n     She is as far from it as Susan B. Anthony was when pushing her\r\n     ballot into the box. And all the difference between the musical\r\n     saint spilling the precious liquid and the unmusical saint\r\n     offering her vote is, that the latter tried to kill several birds\r\n     with one stone, and the former aims at only one.\r\n\r\n     Intemperance, great a curse as it is, is not the only evil whose\r\n     effects bear most heavily on women. Wrong is hydra-headed, and to\r\n     work so hard to cut off one head, when there is a way by which\r\n     all may be dissevered, is not a far-sighted movement; and when\r\n     you add to this the fact that the head is not really cut off, but\r\n     only dazed by unexpected melodies and supplications, there is\r\n     little satisfaction in the effort. We learn that, outside of town\r\n     corporations that have been lately \"rectified,\" the liquor\r\n     traffic still goes on, and the war is to be carried into the\r\n     suburbs. What then? Where next? Which party can play this game\r\n     the longer? Tears, prayers and songs will soon lose their\r\n     novelty--this spasmodic effort will be likely soon to spend\r\n     itself; is there any permanent good being wrought? Liquor traffic\r\n     opposes woman suffrage, and with good reasons. It knows that\r\n     votes change laws, and it also knows that the votes of women\r\n     would change the present temperance laws and make them worth the\r\n     paper on which they are printed. While this uprising of women is\r\n     a hopeful sign, yet it cannot make one law black or white. It\r\n     may, for a time, mold public opinion, but depraved passions and\r\n     appetites need wholesome laws to restrain them. If women would\r\n     only see this and demand the exercise of their right of suffrage\r\n     with half the zeal and unanimity with which they storm a man's\r\n     castle, it would be granted. This is the only ax to lay at the\r\n     root of the tree.\r\n\r\n     Springfield, Ohio, has just had a case in a Justice Court which\r\n     attracted much attention and awakened much interest. A woman\r\n     whose husband had reduced his family to utter want by\r\n     drunkenness, entered a suit against the rumseller. An appeal from\r\n     the drunkard's wife to the ladies of Springfield had been\r\n     circulated in the daily papers, which so aroused them that a\r\n     large delegation of the most respectable and pious women of the\r\n     city came into the court. But the case was adjourned for a week.\r\n     During this time the excitement had become so great that when the\r\n     trial came on the court-room was full of spectators, and the\r\n     number of ladies within the rail was increased three-fold. Mrs.\r\n     E. D. Stewart made the plea to the jury. A verdict was rendered\r\n     against the rumseller. An appeal will be taken; but the citizens\r\n     of Springfield will never forget the influence which the presence\r\n     of women, in sympathy with another wronged woman, had upon the\r\n     court. And what added power those women would have had as\r\n     judges, jurors and advocates; citizens crowned with all the\r\n     rights, privileges and immunities justly theirs by law and\r\n     constitution.\r\n\r\nOf the work in Geauga county, Mrs. Sophia Ober Allen, of South\r\nNewbury writes:\r\n\r\n     In the winter of 1851-2, Anson Read circulated a petition praying\r\n     the legislature to protect married women in their property\r\n     rights; and from that time the subject of women's rights was\r\n     frequently discussed in social and literary gatherings. In 1871,\r\n     Mrs. Lima Ober proposed to be one of six women to go to the\r\n     township election and offer her vote. Nine[293] joined her, but\r\n     all their votes were rejected, the judges saying they feared\r\n     trouble would be the result if they received them. From that year\r\n     to 1876 these heroic women of South Newbury persisted in offering\r\n     their votes at the town, state and presidential elections; and\r\n     though always refused, they would repair to another room with the\r\n     few noble men who sustained them, and there duly cast their\r\n     ballots for justice and equality. On one occasion they polled\r\n     fifty votes--thirty-one women and nineteen men. In 1876 they\r\n     adopted a series of stirring resolutions with a patriotic\r\n     declaration of principles.\r\n\r\n     In 1873, large meetings were held, and a memorial sent to the\r\n     constitutional convention, asking for an amendment, that \"the\r\n     right to vote shall not be denied or abridged to any adult\r\n     citizen except for crime, idiocy or lunacy.\" On January 12, 1874,\r\n     a political club was organized,[294] which has been active in\r\n     holding meetings and picnics, circulating petitions and tracts.\r\n     On July 4, 1874, a basket picnic was held in Ober and Allen's\r\n     grove, at which Gen. A. C. Voris was among the speakers.[295]\r\n     Hon. A. G. Riddle, whose early life was spent mostly in Newbury,\r\n     encouraged and assisted the work, both by voice and pen. During\r\n     the winter of 1878, Susan B. Anthony, in company with my husband\r\n     and myself, lectured in several towns under the auspices of the\r\n     club. Miss Eva L. Pinney, a native of Newbury, was employed by\r\n     the club to canvass the county. Her success was marked. In 1879\r\n     the treasury received a bequest of $50, from Reuben H. Ober, who,\r\n     though spending much of his time in the East, ever sustained a\r\n     live interest in the home society.[296]\r\n\r\nMrs. Sarah Langdon Williams sends us the following report from the\r\nToledo society:\r\n\r\n     In the winter of 1869, Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony returning\r\n     from an extended trip through the West, spent a few days in\r\n     Toledo. In addition to public meetings, their coming was the\r\n     occasion for many pleasant and hospitable gatherings. A large\r\n     circle of intelligent and earnest women were longing and waiting\r\n     to do something to speed the movement for woman suffrage, when\r\n     the coming of these pioneers of reform roused them to action. It\r\n     was like the match to the fire all ready for kindling, and an\r\n     organization was speedily effected.[297] From that time forward,\r\n     the air seemed magnetized with reform ideas, and to the loyal\r\n     band who stood true to their flag, new members were added from\r\n     time to time, and from this little band went forth an influence,\r\n     a steady force which has operated silently though continuously\r\n     through both visible and invisible channels, moulding the thought\r\n     and action of the community. The meetings of this association\r\n     were regularly reported by the daily press, with more or less\r\n     justice, according as the reporter present, or the newspaper\r\n     which reported the proceedings, was more or less friendly.\r\n\r\n     A letter published in _The Revolution_ of June 10, 1869,\r\n     indicates the practical work of our association:\r\n\r\n          The first skirmish along the line of the suffrage army in\r\n          Ohio has been fought, and the friends of reformation may\r\n          well rejoice at the result. In this city there has existed\r\n          for a long time a library association to which women were\r\n          admitted as members, but in the control or management of\r\n          which they had no voice. Under the pressure of influences\r\n          set in motion by your visit, it was resolved that this relic\r\n          of the past should be swept away, that women should be\r\n          represented in the management as well as in the membership\r\n          of the association. At the late election six directors were\r\n          to be chosen among other officers, and Miss Anna C.\r\n          Mott,[298] Mrs. M. W. Bond and Mrs. M. J. Barker were\r\n          candidates upon a ticket called the Equal Rights Ticket,\r\n          headed by Mr. A. W. Gleason, for president. The dangerous\r\n          proposition, not only of allowing women to vote, but of\r\n          giving them offices, was a bombshell in the camp of\r\n          conservatism, and every influence that could be, was brought\r\n          to bear against this ticket. After an exciting contest, the\r\n          result showed that notwithstanding a powerful and\r\n          influential opposition, the ticket was elected by a vote of\r\n          from 186 to 220 out of 327 votes. This result has been all\r\n          the more grateful, because in the opposition were to be\r\n          found many of the most wealthy and respected citizens of\r\n          Toledo.\r\n\r\n          As an index of the interest the women manifested in that\r\n          election, three-fourths of them voted. It was interesting to\r\n          notice the firmness with which the women walked up to the\r\n          ballot-box. No trembling was perceptible. They carried the\r\n          ballot with ease, deposited it with coolness, watched to see\r\n          that no fraud was perpetrated, and then departed as\r\n          noiselessly as they came. The deed was done. Woman's honor,\r\n          woman's purity, woman's domestic felicity, woman's conjugal\r\n          love, woman's fidelity to her home duties, all these and a\r\n          thousand other of the finer qualities were destroyed. No\r\n          more peace in families; no more quiet home evenings; no more\r\n          refined domestic women; but wrangling and discords instead.\r\n          Soldiers and sailors, policemen and gravel-shovelers had\r\n          taken the place of wives and mothers. Sick at heart I went\r\n          to my home and wept for American womanhood. But the sun rose\r\n          as usual, and the world still revolved. I went to the\r\n          police-court--all was quiet. I passed to the county-court,\r\n          and looked over the docket--no new divorce cases met my\r\n          gaze. With unsteady hand I have opened the morning papers\r\n          for the past few days, but nothing there betrayed the\r\n          terrible results of that false step. Oh, women! women! In\r\n          the days of Indian warfare, the skilled hunter would tell\r\n          you that after an attack, when all was quiet, and you\r\n          thought the enemy had departed, the greatest danger awaited,\r\n          and the most careful vigilance was required. So I still keep\r\n          watching, for I know the vengeance of the gods must fall\r\n          upon this worse than Sodom, for since women have voted,\r\n          surely there be not five righteous within the city. Real\r\n          estate is not falling, however, but then!--\r\n\r\n          The evening after the election, the friends of the\r\n          association and of the successful tickets, gathered to\r\n          witness the incoming of the new administration. Hearty words\r\n          of cheer for the future were spoken. The president, Mr.\r\n          Gleason, delivered a beautiful inaugural address, of which I\r\n          send you a few sentences, and the meeting adjourned.\r\n\r\n          The president said: While thanking you most heartily, ladies\r\n          and gentlemen, for the distinguished honor conferred upon me\r\n          in the election, I do not forget that it is due to the great\r\n          principles of equal rights and universal suffrage--not to\r\n          any merits of my own. We live in an age of progress. In my\r\n          humble opinion we have taken a great step forward in\r\n          admitting ladies to the management of this association--not\r\n          only from the fact that in this particular institution they\r\n          hold an equal footing with ourselves, and of right are\r\n          entitled to all its privileges, but from the more important\r\n          fact that it is a recognition here of those principles which\r\n          are now claiming recognition in the political institutions\r\n          of our country. It is in the natural order of events that\r\n          this \"equal rights\" movement should meet with opposition.\r\n          All movements of a novel and radical character at their\r\n          commencement meet with opposition. This is the ordeal\r\n          through which they must pass, but their success or failure\r\n          depends upon their intrinsic merit. Nothing is to be feared\r\n          from opposition to any movement that possesses these\r\n          elements. Whatsoever idea has its origin in the recesses of\r\n          human nature, will, sooner or later, become embodied in\r\n          living action, and so we have this assurance--that as here,\r\n          so also in the political institutions of our country--this\r\n          principle of equal rights, both to man and woman, will at\r\n          last prevail.\r\n\r\n     In 1871 the _Sunday Journal_ offered the association half a\r\n     column, which was gratefully accepted, and Mrs. Sarah Langdon\r\n     Williams appointed editor. The department increased to a full\r\n     page, and the circulation of the paper became as large as that of\r\n     either of the city dailies. When there was danger of its being\r\n     sold to opponents of the cause, Mrs. Williams purchased one-half\r\n     interest, and by so doing kept the other half in the hands of the\r\n     friendly proprietor. In the _Sunday Journal_ the association had\r\n     a medium through which it could promptly answer all unjust\r\n     attacks, and thus kept up a constant agitation. In November,\r\n     1875, the sale of the paper closed for a while direct\r\n     communication between the association and the public. But soon\r\n     becoming restive without any medium through which to express\r\n     itself, the society started _The Ballot-Box_ in April, 1876,\r\n     raising money among the citizens in aid of the enterprise. With\r\n     this first assistance the paper became at once self-supporting,\r\n     and continued thus until April, 1878,[299] when it was\r\n     transferred to Matilda Joslyn Gage, and published at Syracuse, N.\r\n     Y.\r\n\r\n     The convention for the remodeling of the constitution of the\r\n     State, in 1873-74, afforded an opportunity for unflagging efforts\r\n     of the members of the association in the circulation of\r\n     petitions; and so successful were they that when their delegates\r\n     presented themselves with 1,500 signatures, asking for an\r\n     amendment securing the right of suffrage to women, a member of\r\n     the convention, on scanning the roll, exclaimed: \"Why, you have\r\n     here all the solid men of Lucas county.\" Mr. M. R. Waite, since\r\n     chief-justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, was\r\n     president of the convention, and in presenting the petition said\r\n     the names on that paper represented fifteen millions of dollars.\r\n     Mr. Waite's courtesy indicated stronger convictions regarding the\r\n     rights of women than he really possessed. In an interview with\r\n     our committee, appointed to secure a hearing from the\r\n     members-elect--Mr. Waite and Mr. Scribner--Mr. Waite declared\r\n     himself in favor of according equal wages to women, and believed\r\n     them entitled to all other rights, except the right to vote. He\r\n     thought women were entitled to a hearing in the convention, and\r\n     would aid them all he could to secure the privilege. Mr. Waite,\r\n     with great kindness of nature, possesses an inborn conservatism\r\n     which curbs his more generous impulses. He adhered to this\r\n     position in his decision in the case of _Minor vs. Happersett_,\r\n     declaring that \"the constitution of the United States has no\r\n     voters.\" Many of the most sanguine friends were greatly\r\n     disappointed. They had fully believed his love of justice would\r\n     lead him to the broad interpretation of the constitution, so\r\n     clearly the true one, set forth in the first article of the\r\n     fourteenth amendment. It did prevail, however, when, after saying\r\n     the constitution does not confer the right of suffrage with\r\n     citizenship, he said: \"If the law is wrong, it ought to be\r\n     changed; but the power is not with the Supreme Court.\"\r\n\r\n     When, in February, 1873, an irascible judge of the Court of\r\n     Common Pleas refused to ratify the appointment of a woman--Miss\r\n     Mary Sibley--to the office of deputy clerk, which she had filled\r\n     for eight years with unusual acceptance, on the ground that not\r\n     being an elector she was legally disqualified, the association\r\n     determined to dispute the decision in her behalf, and on applying\r\n     through their president to Mr. Waite to act as counsel, he gave\r\n     his unhesitating acceptance, and declared that if the appointment\r\n     was illegal, the law ought to be changed at once. True to his\r\n     promise, he defended her most ably, and engaged other counsel to\r\n     act with him. His services were given gratuitously.\r\n\r\n     Subsequently, in the constitutional convention, an amendment was\r\n     adopted making women eligible to appointive offices, and also to\r\n     any office under the school control, with the exception of State\r\n     commissioner. But when voted upon, the new constitution was lost,\r\n     and with it these amendments. The cause had able advocates in the\r\n     convention, leading whom was General A. C. Voris of Akron, who\r\n     was made chairman of the Special Committee on Woman Suffrage. The\r\n     Standing Committee on Elective Franchise was extremely\r\n     unfriendly, conspicuously so the chairman, Mr. Sample. A Special\r\n     Committee on Woman Suffrage was appointed, which performed its\r\n     duty faithfully, and reported unanimously in favor. Mr. Voris\r\n     worked for the measure with an enthusiasm equaled only by his\r\n     ability. When the report came up for discussion he made a\r\n     masterly speech of two hours, during which the attention was so\r\n     close that a pin could be heard to drop. Other able speeches were\r\n     also made in favor of the measure by some of the most talented\r\n     members of the convention. It came within two votes of being\r\n     carried. The defeat was largely due to the liquor influence in\r\n     the convention. The cause, however, received a new impetus\r\n     through the exertions of General Voris, to whom, second to no\r\n     other person in Ohio, should the thanks of the women be rendered.\r\n     During the contest the Toledo society was constantly on the\r\n     alert. On three occasions it sent its delegates to the\r\n     convention; but it has not limited its work to Ohio alone; it has\r\n     given freely of its means whenever it could to aid the struggle\r\n     in other States, and has rolled up large petitions to congress\r\n     asking for a sixteenth amendment.\r\n\r\n     When the State convention met in Toledo, February, 1873, the\r\n     members of the city society exerted themselves to the utmost to\r\n     have all arrangements for their reception and entertainment of\r\n     the most satisfactory character, and the delegates unanimously\r\n     agreed they had never before had so delightful and successful a\r\n     meeting. Many lasting friendships were formed. The opera-house\r\n     was well filled at every session of the three days' convention.\r\n     At the opening session a cordial address of welcome was given by\r\n     Rev. Robert McCune, one of Toledo's most eloquent Republicans.\r\n     The mayor of the city, Dr. W. W. Jones, a staunch Democrat, also\r\n     made a courteous speech.\r\n\r\n     The Toledo Society has always held itself an independent\r\n     organization, though its members, individually, have identified\r\n     themselves as they chose with other associations. Its attitude\r\n     has been of the most uncompromising character. It has never been\r\n     cajoled into accepting a crumb in any way in the place of the\r\n     whole loaf. Sometimes this has brought upon it the condemnation\r\n     of friends, but in the long run it has won respect, even from\r\n     bitter opponents. An illustration of this was given in its action\r\n     with regard to the centennial celebration. The Fourth of July,\r\n     1876, was to be observed in Toledo as a great gala day. Long\r\n     before its arrival preparations were in progress through which\r\n     patriotic citizens were to express their gratitude over the\r\n     nation's prosperity on the one-hundredth anniversary of freedom.\r\n     All trades, professions and organizations were to join in one\r\n     vast triumphal procession. A call was issued for a meeting, to\r\n     which all organizations were requested to send representatives.\r\n     The Woman Suffrage Association was not neglected, and a circular\r\n     of invitation was mailed to its president. This raised a delicate\r\n     question, for how could women take part in celebrating the\r\n     triumphs of their country whose laws disfranchised them? But,\r\n     having received a courteous recognition, they must respond with\r\n     equal courtesy. The letter was laid before the society, and the\r\n     president instructed to politely decline the honor. _The\r\n     Ballot-Box_ of May, 1876, contains the correspondence:\r\n\r\n                                   TOLEDO, Ohio, April 8, 1876.\r\n\r\n          At a meeting of citizens, held at White's Hall, on the\r\n          evening of the 6th inst., the undersigned were instructed to\r\n          invite your organization, with others, to send a\r\n          representative to a meeting to be held at White's Hall, on\r\n          the evening of Monday, April 17, which will elect an\r\n          executive committee, and make other arrangements for a\r\n          celebration by Toledo of the one-hundredth anniversary of\r\n          American independence in a manner befitting the occasion and\r\n          the character of our city. It is earnestly desired that\r\n          every organization, of whatever nature, in Toledo, be\r\n          represented at this meeting. We would, therefore, ask of you\r\n          that you lay the matter before your organization at its next\r\n          regular meeting, or in case it shall hold no meeting before\r\n          the 17th, that you appear as a representative yourself.\r\n\r\n                                               GUIDO MARX, _Chairman_.\r\n\r\n          D. R. LOCKE, JAMES H. EMORY, _Secretaries_.\r\n\r\n     This was laid before the association at a meeting which occurred\r\n     the same afternoon, and by the order of the society the\r\n     invitation therein conveyed was replied to in season to be read\r\n     at the meeting at White's Hall, April 17:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   TOLEDO, Ohio, April 15, 1876.\r\n\r\n          _Hon. Guido Marx, Messrs. D. R. Locke and James H. Emory_:\r\n\r\n          GENTLEMEN: The printed circular, with your names attached,\r\n          inclosed to my address as president of the Toledo Woman\r\n          Suffrage Association, inviting that body to send a\r\n          representative to a meeting to be held at White's Hall,\r\n          Monday evening, April 17, to elect an executive committee\r\n          and make other arrangements for a celebration by Toledo of\r\n          the one-hundredth anniversary of American independence, was\r\n          received just in time to lay before the meeting held April\r\n          10. It was there decided that while the members of the\r\n          association fully appreciate the generosity of the men of\r\n          Toledo, and feel grateful for the implied recognition of\r\n          their citizenship, yet they manifestly have no centennial to\r\n          celebrate, as the government still holds them in a condition\r\n          of political serfdom, denying them the greatest right of\r\n          citizenship--representation.\r\n\r\n          Conscious, however, of the great results which the nation's\r\n          hundred years have achieved in building up a great people,\r\n          we are aware that you, as American men, have cause for\r\n          rejoicing, and we bid you God-speed in all efforts which you\r\n          may make in the approaching celebration. In an equal degree\r\n          we feel it inconsistent, as a disfranchised class, to unite\r\n          with you in the celebration of that liberty which is the\r\n          heritage of but one-half the people. It is the will,\r\n          therefore, of the association that I respond to the above\r\n          effect, thanking you for your courteous invitation, and\r\n          recognizing with pleasure among your names those who have\r\n          heretofore extended to us their sympathy and aid. I remain,\r\n          with sincere respect, yours,\r\n\r\n                         SARAH R. L. WILLIAMS, _President T. W. S. A._\r\n\r\n     The letter was intended to be in all respects courteous, as the\r\n     writer and the society which she represented had naught but the\r\n     kindest of feelings toward those who, in so friendly a manner,\r\n     recognized their citizenship by inviting them to take part in the\r\n     meeting, and also toward the Toledo public, who, as a general\r\n     thing, had treated their organization with friendly\r\n     consideration. It appears, however, that their attitude was\r\n     misconstrued, according to articles subsequently published in the\r\n     _Blade_ and _Commercial_, which we reproduce below:\r\n\r\n          The women say they \"manifestly have no centennial to\r\n          celebrate.\" If we are not mistaken, the women of this\r\n          country have enjoyed greater progress than the men under our\r\n          free government, and it illy becomes them now to steadily\r\n          and persistently pout because they have not yet attained the\r\n          full measure of their earthly desires--the ballot-box.\r\n          Better by far give a hearty show of appreciation of benefits\r\n          received, and thereby materially aid in further progress.\r\n          Nothing can be gained by their refusing to celebrate the\r\n          one-hundredth anniversary of civil and religious liberty.\r\n          The rights of all are necessarily restricted wherever there\r\n          is a government, and time and experience can alone\r\n          demonstrate just what extension or contraction of rights and\r\n          liberties may be essential to the general good. In our\r\n          judgment the women, by refusing to participate in the coming\r\n          Fourth of July celebration, have committed an error, the\r\n          influence of which cannot but prove prejudicial to the\r\n          interests of their association. The opposite course would\r\n          undoubtedly have won friends.--_Blade._\r\n\r\n          A singularly uncourteous letter was the one sent by the\r\n          Woman Suffrage Association to the meeting at White's Hall.\r\n          Ninety-nine-hundredths of the women of the country will be\r\n          surprised to learn that they \"have no centennial to\r\n          celebrate,\" and will be still more surprised when they\r\n          discover that it is \"inconsistent\" for them to unite with\r\n          their brothers, fathers, sons and husbands \"in the\r\n          celebration of the liberty which is the heritage\" of _all_\r\n          the people. We cannot but feel that the claims set forth by\r\n          the association would command more respectful consideration\r\n          with the display of a different spirit. The maids and\r\n          matrons of 1776 were of a different mold.--_Commercial._\r\n\r\n     The _Blade_ has been a good friend to woman suffrage for many\r\n     years, but we feel that the present article was written in a\r\n     spirit of needless irritability, such as we should think might\r\n     ensue from a fit of indigestion. The _Commercial_, since its\r\n     change of management, has certainly not been unfriendly, and we\r\n     have thought fair. Its present comments are unjust. The following\r\n     editorial appeared in _The Ballot-Box_ of the same date:\r\n\r\n          WHY WE CANNOT CELEBRATE THE CENTENNIAL.--The city dailies\r\n          criticise the suffrage association somewhat severely for\r\n          declining to unite in the centennial celebration. Perhaps\r\n          from the outlook of masculine satisfaction it may seem\r\n          astonishing that patriotism should not inspire us with\r\n          gratitude for the crumbs from the national table; that we\r\n          should not rejoice at the great banquet being prepared. But\r\n          it is as impossible for us to look from their standpoint, as\r\n          for them to see from ours. While appreciating the kindnesses\r\n          measured out to us in this city by our friends and the\r\n          press, yet laboring without visible results for the\r\n          recognition of our rights as citizens of the United States,\r\n          we cannot, even through the potent incentive of sympathizing\r\n          with our \"husbands, fathers, brothers and sons,\" lay aside\r\n          our grievances and rejoice in a triumph which more clearly\r\n          marks our own humiliation.\r\n\r\n          Can our friends inform us what is our crime, that we are\r\n          denied the right of representation? Can they point to any\r\n          mental or moral deficiency, to render justifiable our being\r\n          denied political rights? If not--if there is no just cause\r\n          for our disfranchisement, it surely should not excite\r\n          surprise that we cannot rejoice with those who\r\n          systematically persist in perpetrating this great wrong.\r\n          With no discredit to any of the sovereign voters of this\r\n          nation, we cannot forget that the most ignorant negro, the\r\n          most degraded foreigner, even refugees from justice, are\r\n          accorded the rights which we have been demanding in vain;\r\n          and we are conscious every day and hour these privileges are\r\n          denied us, that we are not only wronged by the American\r\n          government, but insulted. Every year that our appeals for\r\n          political rights to congress and the legislature are denied,\r\n          insult is heaped upon injury. Women are told by those who\r\n          are in the full enjoyment of all the privileges which this\r\n          government can confer, to rejoice in what little they have,\r\n          and wait patiently until more is bestowed. Wait we must,\r\n          because they have the reins of power, but to wait patiently,\r\n          with the light we have to perceive our relative condition,\r\n          would be doing that for which we should despise ourselves.\r\n\r\n          We are not laboring for to-day alone, but for the fruition\r\n          which must come from the establishment of justice. If we\r\n          fail in this memorial year, a brighter day must surely come.\r\n          Our failure now will be the failure of the country to\r\n          improve its opportunities. All the successes which may be\r\n          rejoiced over, all the triumphs of trade, commerce and\r\n          invention are secondary to the rights of citizens, to those\r\n          principles which lie at the foundation of national liberty.\r\n          When women are recognized as citizens of this republic,\r\n          there will be some occasion for their thankfulness and\r\n          rejoicing; then they can join in the jubilee which\r\n          celebrates the birthday of a mighty nation.\r\n\r\n     At the June meeting of the association, a declaration of rights,\r\n     and a series of radical resolutions were adopted. The president\r\n     urged the society to stand firm in the determination to take no\r\n     part in the centennial celebration, and the members of the\r\n     suffrage association passed the Fourth of July quietly at their\r\n     own homes, but they caused a banner, bearing the inscription,\r\n     \"Woman Suffrage and Equal Rights,\" to be hung across one of the\r\n     principal streets, under which the whole procession passed. Of\r\n     the original members of the society,[300] some who during its\r\n     earlier years took an active part have removed elsewhere, and a\r\n     few have passed to the beyond. But the majority still remain, and\r\n     are earnest in their labors with the hope for a better day,\r\n     undampened by the delays and disappointments which attend every\r\n     step in progress.\r\n\r\nThere is a flourishing association at Cleveland called the Western\r\nReserve Club;[301] Mrs. Sarah M. Perkins and her highly educated\r\ndaughters, graduates of Vassar College, are among the leading\r\nmembers. They hold regular meetings, have a course of lectures\r\nevery winter and are exerting a wide influence. The club consists\r\nof thirty members, paying five dollars annually into the treasury.\r\n\r\n     The Painesville Equal Rights Society,[302] formed November 20,\r\n     1883, is one of the most flourishing county associations in the\r\n     State. It numbers 150 members, and it has organized many local\r\n     societies in the vicinity. The annual meeting of the State\r\n     society,[303] held at Painesville, May 11, 12, 13, 1885, with a\r\n     large representation of the most active friends present, by a\r\n     unanimous vote declared itself no longer auxiliary to the\r\n     American, and thereby secured the cooeperation of the Toledo,\r\n     South Newbury, and other independent local organizations of the\r\n     State.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Annie Laurie Quinby for the following account of\r\nthe founding of a hospital for women and children, and of some of\r\nthe difficulties women encountered in gaining admittance into the\r\nmedical colleges:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Quinby says: In 1867, some Cincinnati ladies met at the\r\n     residence of Mrs. J. L. Roberts and organized a health\r\n     association, the object of which was to obtain and disseminate\r\n     knowledge in regard to the science of life and health. Mrs.\r\n     Leavett addressed the ladies on the importance of instituting a\r\n     medical school for women, stating a recent conversation she had\r\n     with Prof. Curtis, and suggesting that he be invited to lay his\r\n     views before them. A vote to that effect was passed, and in his\r\n     address Professor Curtis touched the following points:\r\n\r\n          Women have greater need than men of the knowledge of the\r\n          science of life, and can make more profitable use of it.\r\n          _First_: They need this knowledge. In a practice of\r\n          thirty-six years, full seven-tenths of my services have been\r\n          devoted to women who, had they been properly instructed in\r\n          the science of life, and careful to obey those instructions,\r\n          would not have needed one-seventh of those services, while\r\n          they would have prevented six-sevenths of their sickness,\r\n          suffering and loss of time, and a like proportion of the\r\n          expenses of doctoring, nursing, medicines, etc., etc.\r\n          _Second_: They can make a far better and more profitable use\r\n          of this knowledge than men can, because they can better\r\n          appreciate the liabilities, sufferings and wants of their\r\n          sex, which are far more numerous and imperative than ours;\r\n          and they are always with us, from infancy to boyhood and\r\n          womanhood, to watch us and protect us from injury, and to\r\n          relieve us promptly from the sufferings that may afflict us,\r\n          as well as to teach us how to avoid them. _Third_: Their\r\n          intellectual power to learn principles is as great as ours,\r\n          their perceptions are quicker than ours, their sympathies\r\n          are more tender and persistent, and their watchfulness and\r\n          patient perseverance with the sick are untiring. I regard\r\n          the teaching and practice of the science of life as woman's\r\n          peculiarly appropriate sphere. Its value to the family of\r\n          the wife and the mother, is beyond estimation in dollars and\r\n          cents, by the husband and father. No money that he can\r\n          properly spend to secure it to his daughters, should be\r\n          otherwise appropriated; for, should they never enter the\r\n          family relation, it will be a means of escape from sickness\r\n          mortification and expense to themselves, and of useful and\r\n          honorable subsistence, not only priceless in its possession,\r\n          but totally inalienable by any reverses of fortune. The\r\n          possession of this knowledge from their infancy up, would do\r\n          more to prevent their becoming poor and \"friendless,\" than\r\n          do all the alms houses for the former, and \"homes\" for the\r\n          latter that society can build, while it would cost less to\r\n          each individual than does an elegant modern piano. Forty\r\n          years ago your speaker obtained from the legislature of Ohio\r\n          a liberal university charter under the title of \"The\r\n          Literary and Botanical Medical College of Ohio,\" which was\r\n          afterwards changed to \"The Cincinnati Literary and\r\n          Scientific Institute and Physio-Medical College.\" By the aid\r\n          of able assistants he conducted this institution for the\r\n          benefit of men only, till, in 1851, the students of the\r\n          class were between eighty and ninety. From that time to the\r\n          present, he has received women into the classes and\r\n          demonstrated that they are not only as competent as men to\r\n          learn all parts of the science of life, but, in very many\r\n          particulars, far better qualified for the practice of the\r\n          art of curing disease. The last session of the college was\r\n          suspended that he might travel in the country and learn the\r\n          disposition of the friends of progress to establish the\r\n          institution on a permanent foundation, and is happy to say\r\n          that all that seems necessary to that glorious consummation\r\n          is the prompt and concentrated effort of a few judicious and\r\n          influential ladies and their friends to secure pecuniary\r\n          aid.\r\n\r\n     June 11, 1879, a dispensary for women and children was opened in\r\n     Cincinnati, by Drs. Ellen M. Kirk, and M. May Howells, graduates\r\n     of the New York College and Hospital for Women. Their undertaking\r\n     proving successful, with other ladies of wealth and ability they\r\n     soon after established a hospital. November 1, 1881, the\r\n     certificate of incorporation[304] was filed in the office of the\r\n     secretary of state. The ladies labored unweariedly for the\r\n     support of these institutions. At two public entertainments they\r\n     realized nearly a thousand dollars. For the establishment of a\r\n     homeopathic college they manifested equal earnestness and\r\n     enthusiasm. Many of them interested in this mode of practice,\r\n     seeing the trials of Dr. Pulte in introducing this new theory of\r\n     medicine, determined to help him in building up a college and\r\n     hospital for that practice. By one fair they raised $13,500, net\r\n     profits, and the Pulte Medical College was established. But the\r\n     remarkable fact about these institutions is that after being\r\n     started through the labors of women, women appealed in vain for\r\n     admission for scholarships for a long time. For a clear\r\n     understanding of the matter, and a knowledge of the defense made\r\n     in behalf of the right of women to enter the college, I send you\r\n     the following from Dr. J. D. Buck:\r\n\r\n          Pulte Medical College, of Cincinnati, was organized under\r\n          the common law, and opened in 1872, for the admission of\r\n          students, with no provision, either for or against the\r\n          admission of women. From time to time, during the first\r\n          seven years, the subject of the admission of women was\r\n          broached, but generally bullied out of court amid sneers and\r\n          ridicule. The faculty stood five against and four for. The\r\n          opposition was the most pronounced and bitter imaginable,\r\n          the staple argument being that the mingling of the sexes in\r\n          medical colleges led always and necessarily to\r\n          licentiousness.\r\n\r\n          Finally, in the fall of 1877, seven of the nine members of\r\n          the faculty voted to admit women. One professor voted no,\r\n          and the leader of the opposition, Prof. S. R. Beckwith--a\r\n          life-long opponent of the broader culture of women--left the\r\n          meeting with the purpose of arresting all action. In this,\r\n          however, he failed; the vote was confirmed.\r\n\r\n          On the following day another meeting was held, when the vote\r\n          was re-considered and again confirmed, each of the seven\r\n          members agreeing to stand by it. Still again, another\r\n          meeting was called, at the instance of the leader of the\r\n          opposition, and in the absence of two of the staunch\r\n          friends, a bare majority of the whole faculty voted to\r\n          exclude women, as heretofore, and notified the applicants\r\n          for admission, who had been officially informed of the\r\n          previous resolution to admit them, that they would not be\r\n          admitted.\r\n\r\n          Forbearance on the part of the friends of justice was no\r\n          more to be thought of, and notice was given that the wrong\r\n          should be righted, at all hazards. For the next two years\r\n          war raged persistent and unflinching on the part of the\r\n          friends of the rights of women, bitter and slanderous on the\r\n          part of the opposition. All the tricks of the politician\r\n          were resorted to to defeat the cause of right, and more than\r\n          once by misrepresentation they obtained the announcement in\r\n          the public press that the case was decided, and women\r\n          forever excluded. Still the cause moved on to complete\r\n          triumph, and to the disgrace and final exclusion from the\r\n          college of two of the most bitter leaders of the opposition.\r\n\r\n          In the fall of 1879 it was announced in the annual\r\n          catalogue, \"that students will be admitted to the lectures\r\n          of Pulte college without distinction of sex,\" a very simple\r\n          result indeed, as the outcome of two years' warfare. At the\r\n          opening of lectures the first of October, four female\r\n          students presented themselves, and were admitted to\r\n          matriculation. Every prophecy of disaster had failed. The\r\n          class was an increase in numbers over that of any preceding\r\n          year, and showed a marked improvement in deportment and\r\n          moral tone from the presence of ladies, who from their high\r\n          character and bearing exerted a restraining influence, as\r\n          they always do, on those disposed to be gentlemen. At the\r\n          commencement exercises in March, 1881, three women, viz:\r\n          Miss S. C. O'Keefe, Mrs. Mary N. Street, and Mrs. M. J.\r\n          Taylor, received the degree of the college, after having\r\n          attended the same lectures and been submitted to the same\r\n          examination as the male graduates. The prize for the best\r\n          examination (in writing) in physiology, was awarded to Miss\r\n          Stella Hunt, of Cincinnati. The right of women to admittance\r\n          to this college cannot again be raised except by a\r\n          two-thirds vote of both faculty and trustees--a majority\r\n          which will be difficult to obtain after the record which the\r\n          women have already made as students in the institution.\r\n\r\n                         Yours truly,                    J. D. BUCK.\r\n\r\nAfter all this educational work and this seeming triumph for the\r\nrecognition of an equal status in the colleges for women, we find\r\nthis item going the rounds of the daily journals, under date of\r\nCleveland, March 29, 1885:\r\n\r\n     Considerable excitement prevails among the homeopathists of\r\n     Cleveland. Commencement exercises of the college are to be held\r\n     next Tuesday evening, and Miss Madge Dickson, of Chambers, Pa.,\r\n     was to have delivered the salutatory address. Dr. H. H. Baxter, a\r\n     prominent professor of the college, objected, saying a woman\r\n     salutatorian would disgrace the college. Miss Dickson resigned\r\n     the honor, and no address will be delivered.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1873, Miss Nettie Cronise of Tiffin, was admitted to the\r\nbar. In the following September, her sister Florence was admitted,\r\nand they practiced as N. & F. Cronise, until Miss Nettie's marriage\r\nwith N. B. Lutes, with whom she has since been associated under the\r\nfirm name of Lutes & Lutes. Miss Florence Cronise has her office in\r\nTiffin. Soon after commencing practice Mrs. Lutes was appointed to\r\nexamine applicants for admission to the bar, the first instance of\r\na woman serving in this capacity in the United States, although\r\nFlorence Cronise and one or two other women have since done like\r\nduty. These ladies and Miss Hulett were the first women to open law\r\noffices and begin an active, energetic practice of the profession.\r\n\r\nIn 1885, Miss Mary P. Spargo of Cleveland, was admitted to the bar.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[285] Among those associated with Mrs. Mendenhall were Mrs. Calvin\r\nW. Starbuck, Mrs. W.

Jordin, of Coldwater, Mich., a\r\ngraduate of the academic and law departments of the University of\r\nMichigan, entered the Yale law school to-day. She is the first\r\nwoman ever entered in any department of Yale outside of the art\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n[293] Mesdames Lima H. Ober, Lovina Greene, Hophni Smith, Ruth F.\r\nMunn, Perleyette M. Burnett, Sophia L. O. Allen, Mary Hodges, Lydia\r\nSmith, Sarah A. Knox. The men who sustained and voted with these\r\nwomen were Deacon Amplias Greene, Darius M. Allen, Ransom Knox,\r\nApollos D. Greene, Wesley Brown. Their tickets were different each\r\nyear; their first read, \"Our Motto--Equal Rights for all--Taxation\r\nwithout Representation is Tyranny. Our Foes--Tradition and\r\nSuperstition.\" Among the speakers invited to address the people at\r\nthe polls were Mrs. Organ, of Yellow Springs, and Mrs. Hope\r\nWhipple, of Clyde.\r\n\r\n[294] _President_, Ruth F. Munn; _Vice-Presidents_, Joel Walker, D.\r\nM. Allen; _Recording Secretary_, Ellen Munn; _Corresponding\r\nSecretary_, Julia P. Greene; _Treasurer_, Mary Hodges; _Executive\r\nCommittee_, William Munn, Sophia L. O. Allen, Amanda M. Greene,\r\nApollos D.

Porter.\r\n\r\n[296] The Society of South Newbury, like that of Toledo, refrained\r\nfrom auxiliaryship with the State Association from the time of its\r\norganization to June, 1885, when such relationship was made\r\npossible by the State Society voting itself an independent\r\norganization, free to cooeperate with all national or local\r\nassociations that have for their object the enfranchisement of\r\nwomen; and to Mrs. Allen may be ascribed a large share of the\r\ncredit for the good work and broad platform of the South Newbury\r\nclub.\r\n\r\n[297] The presidents of the Toledo Society have been, Emma J.\r\nAshley, Elizabeth R. Collins, Sarah R. L. Williams, Rosa L. Segur,\r\nJulia P. Cole, Sarah S. Bissell, Ellen S. Fray, Mary J. Cravens.\r\nThe vice-presidents, Martha Stebbins, Julia Harris, S. R. L.\r\nWilliams, Sarah S. Bissell, Ellen Sully Fray, Mary J. Barker. Miss\r\nCharlotte Langdon Williams rendered valuable service in the\r\nbusiness department of _The Ballot-Box_, and served for three years\r\nas secretary and treasurer of the association.\r\n\r\n[298] Miss Anna C. Mott, and her father, Richard Mott, were two\r\nstrong pillars of the woman suffrage movement in Ohio; their\r\nbeautiful home has for many years been a harbor of rest alike to\r\nthe advocates of anti-slavery, temperance and woman's rights.\r\n\r\n[299] Mrs. Williams further adds that _The Ballot-Box_ became also\r\na foster child of the National Association, Miss Anthony canvassing\r\nfor it after each of her lectures during the winters of 1877 and\r\n1878, thus largely increasing the circulation. It, on the other\r\nhand, gave full and faithful account of the work of the National\r\nAssociation, so that in reality it was the organ of the National as\r\nwell as of the Toledo society.\r\n\r\n[300] The officers of the Toledo Society are, 1885, _President_,\r\nMrs. Mary J.

Every large town can\r\nboast a woman's literary club, a reading-room, nicely furnished,\r\nwith a library containing, in many cases, one and two thousand\r\nvolumes, a choice collection of scientific, historical and\r\nclassical works. This may be attributed in part to the fact that\r\nthe population is largely from New York and New England, partly to\r\nthe many institutions of learning early opened to girls, and partly\r\nto the extensive social influence of Mrs. Lucinda H. Stone,[305]\r\nwhose rare culture, foreign travels and liberal views have fitted\r\nher, both as a woman and as a teacher, to inspire the girls of\r\nMichigan with a desire for thorough education. Mrs. Stone has\r\ntraveled through many countries in the old world with large classes\r\nof young ladies under her charge, superintending their reading and\r\nstudies, and giving them lectures on history and art on classic\r\nground, where some of the greatest tragedies of the past were\r\nenacted; in ancient palaces, temples and grand cathedrals; upon the\r\nvery spots still rich with the memories of kings and popes, great\r\ngenerals, statesmen, poets and philosophers. We cannot estimate the\r\nadvantages to these young travelers of having one always at hand,\r\nable to point out the beauties in painting and statuary, to\r\ninterpret the symbols and mysteries of architecture, the language\r\nof music, the facts of history, and the philosophy of the rise and\r\nfall of mighty nations. Mrs. Stone has also given courses of parlor\r\nlectures to large classes of ladies in every city of the State,\r\nthus, with her rare experiences and extensive observations,\r\nenriching every circle of society in which she moved.\r\n\r\nTo Catharine A. F. Stebbins we are indebted for compiling many of\r\nthe facts contained in this chapter. Reviewing the last forty\r\nyears, she says:\r\n\r\n     The agitation on the question of woman suffrage began in this\r\n     State in 1846, with the advent of Ernestine L. Rose,[306] who\r\n     spoke twice in the legislative hall in Detroit--once on the\r\n     \"Science of Government,\" and once on the \"Antagonisms in\r\n     Society.\" A resolution was passed by the House of\r\n     Representatives, expressing a high sense of her ability,\r\n     eloquence and grace of delivery. Her work in Detroit, Ann Arbor\r\n     and other places was three or four years prior to the first\r\n     report by the Special Committee of the Senate in the general\r\n     revision of the constitution, nine years before the House\r\n     Committee's report on elections in response to women's petitions,\r\n     and a dozen years before the favorable \"report of the Senate upon\r\n     the memorial of ladies praying for the privilege of the elective\r\n     franchise,\" signed by Thomas W. Ferry.\r\n\r\n     _The Revolution_ of April 30, 1868, gives an account of the\r\n     manner the women of Sturgis voted on the question of prohibition:\r\n\r\n          \"A few weeks ago, at a large meeting of the citizens of\r\n          Sturgis, Michigan, the ladies were asked to help in the\r\n          coming election the cause of prohibition. They replied that\r\n          they would if they were allowed to vote. At a subsequent\r\n          meeting the gentlemen could do no less than to invite them.\r\n          A committee of twelve was appointed. They canvassed the\r\n          village and invited all the ladies to come out and join in\r\n          the demonstration. At 2 o'clock on election day they\r\n          assembled at Union School Hall and marched to the room where\r\n          the election was held, and one hundred and fourteen\r\n          deposited their votes in favor of prohibition, and six\r\n          against it. Whilst they were marching through the room the\r\n          utmost order prevailed, and when they were retiring three\r\n          hearty cheers were given for the ladies of Sturgis. Great\r\n          credit is due to Mrs. William Kyte, chairman of the\r\n          committee, as well as to all the other members, for their\r\n          management of the whole affair. The utmost good feeling\r\n          prevailed, and not a sneer or a jeer was heard from the\r\n          lords of creation, but a large majority seemed to hail this\r\n          as a precursor of what they expect in the future, when the\r\n          people shall be educated to respect the rights of all.\"\r\n\r\n          We find the above in the Sturgis _Journal_, by the way, one\r\n          of the best in tone and talent of all our western\r\n          exchanges. Its editor, Mr. Wait, is a prominent leader in\r\n          the State, a member of the legislature, and a believer in\r\n          the equal civil and political rights of women. We have more\r\n          than once suggested in _The Revolution_ that the women\r\n          should appear at the polls on election days and demand their\r\n          rights as citizens. The effect could not but be beneficial\r\n          wherever tried. Any considerable number of intelligent women\r\n          in almost any locality would in this way soon inaugurate a\r\n          movement to result in a speedy triumph. Let these noble\r\n          Sturgis women persevere. Methodist Bishop Simpson was right\r\n          when he declared the vote of woman at the polls would soon\r\n          extinguish the perdition fires of intemperance. The Sturgis\r\n          women have begun the good work, a hundred and fourteen to\r\n          six! Surely, blessed are the husbands and children of such\r\n          wives and mothers.\r\n\r\n                                                            P. P.\r\n\r\n     In _The Revolution_ of September 3, 1868, we find the following\r\n     from the Sturgis _Star_:\r\n\r\n          Last spring the ladies of Sturgis went to the polls one\r\n          hundred and twenty in number, and demonstrated the propriety\r\n          of the movement. Their votes did not count, for they could\r\n          only be cast in a separate box, and the movement was only\r\n          good in its moral effect. But at the school meeting the\r\n          ladies have an equal right to vote with the men. Whatever\r\n          qualifications a man must possess to exercise privileges in\r\n          that meeting, any woman possessing like qualifications can\r\n          exercise like privileges there. To substantiate this, it is\r\n          only necessary to read the school law. Section 145 of the\r\n          Primary School law: \"The words 'qualified voter' shall be\r\n          taken and construed to mean and include _all taxable\r\n          persons_ residing in the district of the age of twenty-one\r\n          years, and who have resided therein three months next\r\n          preceding the time of voting.\"\r\n\r\n          Ex-State Superintendent John M. Gregory's opinion of that\r\n          is, that \"under this section (145) all persons liable to be\r\n          taxed in the district, and twenty-one years of age, and\r\n          having resided three months in the district, without\r\n          distinction of sex, color, or nationality, may vote in the\r\n          district meetings.\" In districts where they elect only a\r\n          director, assessor and moderator, the women can vote on all\r\n          questions except the election of officers. In graded\r\n          districts they can vote on all questions, election of\r\n          trustees included. Men having no taxable property, but who\r\n          vote at town meetings and general elections, can only vote\r\n          for trustees at a school meeting. Any woman, then, having a\r\n          watch, cow, buggy, or personal property of any kind, subject\r\n          to tax, or who has real estate in her own name, or jointly\r\n          with her husband, can vote. Here, then, is a lawful right\r\n          for women to vote at school meetings, and as there can be no\r\n          impropriety in it, we advocate it. We believe that it will\r\n          work good. Our Union school is something that all should\r\n          feel an active interest in. We hope, then, that those ladies\r\n          entitled to vote will exercise the rights that the law\r\n          grants them. To give these suggestions a practical effect,\r\n          we cheerfully publish the following notice:\r\n\r\n          The undersigned respectfully request those ladies residing\r\n          in District No. 3, of the township of Sturgis, who are\r\n          entitled to vote at the annual meeting, to assemble in Mrs.\r\n          Pendleton's parlor, at the Exchange Hotel, on Friday evening\r\n          next, August 28, at 7:30 o'clock, to consider the matter of\r\n          exercising the privilege which the law gives them.\r\n\r\n          This call is signed by about twenty of the best women of the\r\n          borough. Last week we called attention in _The Revolution_\r\n          to the earnestness of the English women in urging their\r\n          claim to the right of suffrage, and appealed to American\r\n          women from their example. We hear from different sources\r\n          that American women will attempt, to some extent, to be\r\n          registered this year as voters, and we hope so brave an\r\n          example will become a contagion. A boastful warrior once\r\n          demanded of his foe, \"Deliver up your arms.\" The answer was,\r\n          \"Come, if you dare, and take them!\" Let women become brave\r\n          enough to take their rights, and there will not be much\r\n          resistance. According to their faith and their courage, so\r\n          shall it be.\r\n\r\n                                                            P. P.\r\n\r\n     The Michigan State Suffrage Society--always an independent\r\n     association--was organized at the close of the first convention\r\n     held in Hamblin's Opera-house, Battle Creek,[307] January 20,\r\n     1870, and has done the usual work of aiding in the formation of\r\n     local societies, circulating tracts and petitions, securing\r\n     hearings before the legislature, and holding its annual meetings\r\n     from year to year in the different cities of the State.\r\n\r\n     The Northwestern Association held its first annual convention in\r\n     the Young Men's Hall, Detroit, November 28, 29, 1870, with large\r\n     and appreciative audiences.[308] Legislative action on the\r\n     question of woman suffrage began in Michigan in 1849, when:\r\n\r\n          The special report favorable to Senate document No. 10, for\r\n          universal suffrage, was signed by Dwight Webb, Edward H.\r\n          Thompson and Rix Robinson.--House document No. 31,\r\n          legislature of 1855: \"The Committee on Elections, to whom\r\n          was referred the petition of Betsy P. Parker, Lucinda Knapp,\r\n          Nancy Fleming, Electa Myers, and several other\r\n          'strong-minded' ladies of Lenawee county, asking such\r\n          amendments to the constitution of the State as will secure\r\n          to women an equal right to the elective franchise with men,\"\r\n          reported adversely, ridiculed the petitioners, and was\r\n          signed by A. P. Moorman.--Senate document No. 27, in the\r\n          session of 1857: On a memorial of ladies praying the\r\n          legislature to grant them the elective franchise, the report\r\n          was signed by Thomas W. Ferry, and was favorable and\r\n          respectful.--House document No. 25, legislature of 1859: On\r\n          constitutional amendments in favor of universal suffrage,\r\n          the report was favorable for extending suffrage to colored\r\n          men, but doubtful as to the wisdom of extending it to women.\r\n          This was signed by Fabius Miles, chairman.--Senate document\r\n          No. 12: Upon the same constitutional amendments, in the\r\n          legislature of 1859, the report signed by R. E. Trowbridge,\r\n          chairman of the committee, was adverse to extending suffrage\r\n          to women.\r\n\r\n          On February 13, 1873, Mr. Lamb introduced \"a joint\r\n          resolution granting the privilege of the elective franchise\r\n          to the women of the State.\" Mr. Bartholomew introduced \"a\r\n          joint resolution proposing an amendment to section 1,\r\n          article 1., of the constitution, in relation to the\r\n          qualifications of electors.\" Both were referred to the\r\n          Committee on Elections, which made the following report:\r\n\r\n          The Committee on Elections, to whom was referred the joint\r\n          resolution granting the privilege of the elective franchise\r\n          to women of this State, respectfully report that they have\r\n          had the same under consideration, and have directed me to\r\n          report the same back to the House without recommendation. We\r\n          think the time has not arrived for us to decide on so\r\n          important a matter. We await further developments, and are\r\n          under the impression that there is no popular demand for the\r\n          change--at least not sufficient to warrant us in\r\n          recommending so important a change in our form of government\r\n          at the present session of the legislature--and ask to be\r\n          discharged from the further consideration of the subject.\r\n\r\n                         [Signed:]       A.

Referred to\r\n          the Committee on Elections and State Affairs, jointly. On\r\n          March 12 the following memorial from the State Woman\r\n          Suffrage Association[309] was presented in the House:\r\n\r\n\r\n          _To the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of\r\n          Michigan, in Special Session Convened: _\r\n\r\n          The Executive Committee of the Michigan State Woman Suffrage\r\n          Association, at their meeting held in Kalamazoo, February\r\n          10, 1874, voted to memorialize your honorable body, at your\r\n          special session now being held.\r\n\r\n          We beg leave to represent to you that the object of this\r\n          association is to secure, in a legal way, the\r\n          enfranchisement of the women of the State. They are, as you\r\n          well know, already recognized as citizens of the State\r\n          according to the laws of the United States. They are now\r\n          taxed for all purposes of public interest as well as the\r\n          men. But they are not represented in the legislature, nor in\r\n          any branch of the State government, thus affording a great\r\n          example, and an unjust one for women, of taxation without\r\n          representation, which our fathers declared to be tyranny;\r\n          and which is contrary to the genius of our republican\r\n          institutions, and to the general polity of this\r\n          commonwealth. Women are also governed, while they have no\r\n          direct voice in the government, and made subject to laws\r\n          affecting their property, their personal rights and liberty,\r\n          in whose enactment they have no voice.\r\n\r\n          We therefore petition your honorable body, that in preparing\r\n          a new constitution, to be submitted for adoption or\r\n          rejection by the people of this State, you will strike out\r\n          the word \"male\" from the article defining the qualifications\r\n          of electors; or if deemed best by you, will provide for the\r\n          separate submission of an article for the enfranchisement of\r\n          the women of Michigan, giving them equal rights and\r\n          privileges with the men. By thus taking the lead of the\r\n          States of the Union, to more fully secure the personal\r\n          rights of all the citizens, you will show yourselves in\r\n          harmony with the spirit of the age and worthy to be called\r\n          pioneers in this cause, as you are already most honorably\r\n          accounted pioneers in your educational system, which affords\r\n          equal and impartial advantages to the population of our\r\n          State, irrespective of sex or condition in life--thus aiming\r\n          to elevate the entire people to the highest practicable\r\n          plane of intelligence and true civilization.\r\n\r\n          By order, and in the name of the Michigan Woman Suffrage\r\n          Association.\r\n\r\n                          LUCINDA H.

WALKER, _President._\r\n\r\n          On March 14, the joint committee made the following report:\r\n\r\n          The committees on State affairs and elections, to whom was\r\n          referred the joint resolution proposing an amendment to\r\n          section I, article VII., of the constitution, in relation to\r\n          the qualifications of electors, respectfully report that\r\n          they have had the same under consideration, and have\r\n          directed us to report the same back to the House without\r\n          amendment, and recommend that it do pass and ask to be\r\n          discharged from the further consideration of the subject.\r\n\r\n          The reasons which have influenced the committee in\r\n          recommending an amendment so radical and sweeping in the\r\n          changes which it will create if finally adopted by the\r\n          people, are briefly these: The question of granting the\r\n          right of suffrage to women equally with men, is one that has\r\n          been seriously and widely agitated for years, and while,\r\n          like other political reforms which change in any\r\n          considerable degree the old and established order of things,\r\n          it has met with strong opposition, on the other hand it has\r\n          been ably advocated by men and women distinguished alike for\r\n          their intellectual ability and their excellent judgment.\r\n          Although we believe that there should be certain necessary\r\n          and proper restrictions to the exercise of the elective\r\n          franchise, we are of the opinion that there are reasonable\r\n          grounds to doubt whether the distinction of sex in the\r\n          matter of voting, is not, in a large measure, a fictitious\r\n          one. The interests of women in all matters pertaining to\r\n          good government are certainly identical with those of men.\r\n          In the matter of property their rights conceded by law are\r\n          equal, and in some respects superior to those of men; and if\r\n          the principle of no taxation without representation is a\r\n          just one as applied among men, it would seem that it might\r\n          in justice be extended to women. As the reasons given above\r\n          are strongly urged by the advocates of woman suffrage, and\r\n          as several petitions, numerously signed by citizens of the\r\n          State, asking for some action on the part of the House in\r\n          this matter, are in the hands of the committee, we have\r\n          deemed it advisable, although not equally agreed as to the\r\n          main question involved, to recommend the passage of the\r\n          resolution by the House, in order that the people of the\r\n          State may have an opportunity of expressing their will at\r\n          the ballot-box as to the expediency of extending the right\r\n          of suffrage to women.\r\n\r\n          SAMUEL H. BLACKMAN, _Chairman of Committee on State Affairs._\r\n          JAMES BURNES, _Chairman of Committee on Elections._\r\n\r\n          Report accepted, and joint resolution placed on the general\r\n          order.\r\n\r\n          On March 18 the following joint resolution passed the House\r\n          by a vote of 67 to 27, and passed the Senate by a vote of 26\r\n          to 4,[310] proposing an amendment to section I of article\r\n          VII. of the constitution, in relation to the qualification\r\n          of electors:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved, By the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\n          State of Michigan_, That at the election when the amended\r\n          constitution shall be submitted to the electors of this\r\n          State for adoption or rejection, there shall be submitted to\r\n          such electors the following propositions, to be substituted\r\n          in case of adoption, for so much of section I, of article\r\n          VII., as precedes the proviso therein, in the present\r\n          constitution of this State as it now stands, and substituted\r\n          for section I, article VII., in said amended constitution,\r\n          if the latter is adopted, to wit:\r\n\r\n          SECTION 1. In all elections, every person of the age of\r\n          twenty-one years who shall have resided in this State three\r\n          months, and in the township or ward in which he or she\r\n          offers to vote ten days next preceding an election,\r\n          belonging to either of the following classes, shall be an\r\n          elector and entitled to vote:\r\n\r\n          _First_--Every citizen of the United States; _Second_--Every\r\n          inhabitant of this State, who shall have resided in the\r\n          United States two years and six months, and declared his or\r\n          her intention to become a citizen of the United States\r\n          pursuant to the laws thereof, six months preceding an\r\n          election; _Third_--Every inhabitant residing in this State\r\n          on the twenty-fourth day of June, one thousand eight hundred\r\n          and seventy-five.\r\n\r\n          Said proposition shall be separately submitted to the\r\n          electors of this State for their adoption or rejection, in\r\n          form following, to wit: A separate ballot may be given by\r\n          every person having the right to vote, to be deposited in a\r\n          separate box. Upon the ballot given for said proposition\r\n          shall be written, or printed, or partly written and partly\r\n          printed, the words, \"Woman Suffrage,--Yes\"; and upon ballots\r\n          given against the adoption thereof, in like manner, the\r\n          words, \"Woman Suffrage,--No.\" If at said election a majority\r\n          of the votes given upon said proposition shall contain the\r\n          words, \"Woman Suffrage,--Yes,\" then said proposition shall\r\n          be substituted for so much of section I, of article VII., as\r\n          includes the proviso therein in the present constitution of\r\n          the State as it now stands, or substituted for section I, of\r\n          article VII., in said amended constitution, if the latter is\r\n          adopted.\r\n\r\n     This bill was promptly signed by Governor Bagley, and from that\r\n     hour the attention of the advocates of suffrage for women was\r\n     centered on Michigan.\r\n\r\n     The submission of this amendment to a vote of the people, gave an\r\n     unusual interest and importance to the annual meeting held at\r\n     Lansing, May 6, 1874,[311] at which plans were to be made, and\r\n     money raised for a vigorous campaign throughout the State. The\r\n     large number of women ready to do the speaking, and the equally\r\n     large number of men ready to make generous contributions, were\r\n     most encouraging in starting. Women who could not aid the cause\r\n     in any other way cast their gold watches into the treasury. From\r\n     the large number of letters received at this convention we may\r\n     judge how thoroughly aroused the friends were all over the\r\n     country. Lydia Maria Child wrote:\r\n\r\n          It is urged, that if women participated in public affairs,\r\n          puddings would be spoiled, and stockings neglected.\r\n          Doubtless some such cases might occur; for we have the same\r\n          human nature as men, and men are sometimes so taken up with\r\n          elections as to neglect their business for a while. But I\r\n          apprehend that puddings and stockings, to say nothing of\r\n          nurseries, suffer much greater detriment from the present\r\n          expenditure of time and thought upon the heartless\r\n          ostentation of parties, and the flounces and fripperies of\r\n          fashion, than can possibly accrue from the intellectual\r\n          cultivation of women, or their participation in public\r\n          affairs. Voting is a mere incident in the lives of men. It\r\n          does not prevent the blacksmith from shoeing horses, or the\r\n          farmer from planting fields, or the lawyer from attending\r\n          courts; so I see no reason why it need to prevent women from\r\n          attending to their domestic duties. On certain subjects,\r\n          such as intemperance, licentiousness and war, women would be\r\n          almost universally sure to exert their influence in the\r\n          right directions, for the simple reason that they peculiarly\r\n          suffer from the continuance of these evils. In the discharge\r\n          of this new function, they would doubtless make some\r\n          mistakes, and yield to some temptations, just as men do. But\r\n          the consciousness of being an acknowledged portion of the\r\n          government of the country would excite a deeper interest in\r\n          its welfare, and produce a serious sense of responsibility,\r\n          which would gradually invigorate and ennoble their\r\n          characters.\r\n\r\n          THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON wrote: I believe that we fail to\r\n          establish a truly republican government, or to test the\r\n          principle of universal suffrage, so long as we enfranchise\r\n          one sex only.\r\n\r\n          A. BRONSON ALCOTT wrote: * * * Where women lead--the best\r\n          women--is it unsafe for men to follow? Woman's influence\r\n          cannot be confined to her household; woman is, and will be,\r\n          womanly wherever placed. No condition can unsex the sexes.\r\n          The ten commandments will not suffer in her keeping. Her\r\n          vote will tell for the virtues, against the vices all. Plato\r\n          said: \"Either sex alone is but half itself.\" Socially, we\r\n          admit his assertion, and are just beginning to suspect that\r\n          our republican institutions need to be complemented and\r\n          rounded with woman's counsels, and administrations also.\r\n          Good republicans are asking if our legislation is not\r\n          unsettled, demoralized by the debauchery of hasty politics,\r\n          by private vices, and the want of manly integrity, woman's\r\n          honor. Let our courtesy to women be sincere--paid to her\r\n          modesty as to her person; her intelligence as to her\r\n          housekeeping; her refining influence in political as in\r\n          social circles. Where a husband would blush to take his wife\r\n          and daughters, let him blush to be seen by his sons. \"Revere\r\n          no god,\" says Euripides, \"whom men adore by night.\" And\r\n          Sophocles: \"Seek not thy fellow-citizens to guide till thou\r\n          canst order well thine own fireside.\" Mrs. Alcott and Louisa\r\n          join in hearty hopes for your success.\r\n\r\n          EDNA D. CHENEY wrote: * * * How I long for the time when\r\n          this question being settled, we can all go forward, working\r\n          together, to discuss and settle the really great questions\r\n          of political and social economy, of labor, of education, and\r\n          the full development of human life in State and society.\r\n\r\n          JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER wrote: * * * I hope and trust the\r\n          electors will be wise and generous enough to decide it in\r\n          your favor. Were I a citizen of the State I should esteem it\r\n          alike a duty and a privilege to vote in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n          ASA MAHAN, president of Oberlin College, wrote: The cause\r\n          which has called you together is a very plain one. It is\r\n          simply this, whether \"taxation without representation\" is\r\n          tyranny to all but one-half of the human race, and the\r\n          principle that rulers derive their authority to make and\r\n          administer law from the consent of the governed, holds true\r\n          of the white man and the black man, of man native or foreign\r\n          born, and even of the \"heathen Chinee,\" if he belong to the\r\n          male sex, and is a lie in its application to woman.[312]\r\n\r\n     Dr. Stone, of Kalamazoo, read an able report of what had been\r\n     done, and all it was necessary to do if the friends desired to\r\n     carry the pending amendment. The following extract will give some\r\n     idea of the momentous undertaking in canvassing a State:\r\n\r\n          When the governor decided to call an extra session of the\r\n          legislature, so as to submit the new constitution to a\r\n          popular vote next November, the committee had but little\r\n          time for the circulation of petitions; but enough was done\r\n          to secure the vote in favor of submission. This was the more\r\n          easily accomplished because we have in the present\r\n          legislature so many warm and active friends, who gave that\r\n          body no rest until their point was carried. And here we find\r\n          ourselves suddenly brought into a campaign almost as novel\r\n          as momentous, with scarce a precedent to guide us. We ask\r\n          the electors of Michigan to share their civil and political\r\n          power with those who have always been denied all electoral\r\n          rights--to vest the popular sovereignty not merely in\r\n          themselves, in a quarter of a million of men, as hitherto,\r\n          but in half a million of men and women, and so make our\r\n          State what it is not now, a truly republican commonwealth.\r\n          We have a great work before us, and no time should be lost\r\n          in organizing a general canvass of the entire State.\r\n          Competent lecturers should be employed wherever hearers can\r\n          be found, and money raised to defray the expenses. Printed\r\n          documents too, must be circulated; arguments and conclusions\r\n          framed by those who have thought on these subjects for men,\r\n          and sometimes for women, who are too indolent to think for\r\n          themselves. And there are many other things which we must do\r\n          before the November election; ballots must be furnished for\r\n          every township and polling place, especially affirmative\r\n          ballots, and placed in the hands of all the voters. The\r\n          Executive Committee cannot be ubiquitous enough to\r\n          discharge all these multifarious duties. We therefore\r\n          suggest that there be appointed during this meeting,\r\n          _First_, a Committee on Finance. _Second_, a Committee on\r\n          Printed Documents. _Third_, a Committee on Lecturers.\r\n          _Fourth_, a County Committee of perhaps three persons in\r\n          each county, who shall have power also to appoint a\r\n          sub-committee in each township. Whether so many distinct\r\n          committees will be needed, or more than one class of duties\r\n          can be entrusted to the same committee, the association can\r\n          determine. We do not want too much, nor too complicated\r\n          machinery, but just enough to accomplish the work. We must\r\n          fall into line; woman expects every man to do his duty;\r\n          surely she will not fail to be true to herself.\r\n\r\n     Representatives from the different counties gave their names[313]\r\n     as ready to begin the work arranged by the several committees.\r\n     With this large and enthusiastic convention the campaign may be\r\n     said fairly to have opened at Lansing early in May, a political\r\n     organization being formed of Republicans and Democrats alike,\r\n     representing nearly every district in the State. Governor Bagley\r\n     having promptly signed the bill, and his wife being an earnest\r\n     advocate of the measure, the social influence of the family was\r\n     all in the right direction. The influence of the church, too, was\r\n     in a measure favorable. The Methodist denomination, in its\r\n     general conference, passed a resolution indorsing woman suffrage.\r\n     Mrs. Stanton, in a letter to the _Golden Age_, said:\r\n\r\n          During the time I spent in Michigan, speaking every night\r\n          and twice on Sunday to crowded houses, I had abundant\r\n          opportunities of feeling the pulse of the people, both in\r\n          public and private, and it seemed to me that the tide of\r\n          popular thought and feeling was running in the right\r\n          direction. The people are beginning to regard the idea of\r\n          woman's equality with man as not only a political, but a\r\n          religious truth, Methodist, Congregational, Presbyterian,\r\n          Baptist and Unitarian churches being all alike thrown open\r\n          to its consideration. Sitting Sunday after Sunday in the\r\n          different pulpits with reverend gentlemen, my discourses\r\n          given in the place of the sermon, in the regular services, I\r\n          could not help thinking of the distance we had come since\r\n          that period in civilization when Paul's word was law, \"Let\r\n          your women keep silence in the churches.\" Able men and women\r\n          are speaking in every part of the State, and if our triumph\r\n          should not be complete at the next election, at all events a\r\n          great educational work will have been accomplished in the\r\n          distribution of tracts, in the public debates, and in\r\n          reviewing the fundamental principles of our government and\r\n          religion. Being frequently told that women did not wish to\r\n          vote, I adopted the plan of calling for a rising vote at the\r\n          close of my lectures, and on all occasions a majority of the\r\n          women would promptly rise. Knowing that the men had the\r\n          responsibility of voting before their eyes, and might be\r\n          diffident about rising, I reversed the manner of expression\r\n          in their case, requesting all those in favor of woman\r\n          suffrage to keep their seats, and those opposed to rise up,\r\n          thus throwing the onerous duty of changing their attitudes\r\n          on the opposition. So few arose under such circumstances\r\n          that it was somewhat embarrassing for those who did.\r\n\r\n     Those who were engaged in the canvass[314] had enthusiastic\r\n     meetings everywhere. They not only filled all their regular\r\n     appointments, but spoke in the prisons, asylums; even the deaf\r\n     and dumb were refreshed with the gospel of woman suffrage. The\r\n     press, too, was generally favorable, though the opposition\r\n     magnified the occasional adverse criticisms out of all proportion\r\n     to their severity and number. Towards the last of September Miss\r\n     Anthony, by invitation of Mrs. Briggs and Mrs. Bliss of Grand\r\n     Rapids, came into the State and remained until election day. She\r\n     often brought down the house with her witty comments on the\r\n     criticisms of the press.[315]\r\n\r\n     Everything that could be done was done by the friends of the\r\n     amendment throughout the State; meetings held and tracts on every\r\n     phase of the question scattered in all the most obscure\r\n     settlements; inspiring songs sung, earnest prayers offered, the\r\n     press vigilant in its appeals, and on election day women\r\n     everywhere at the polls, persuading voters to cast their ballots\r\n     for temperance, moral purity and good order, to be secured only\r\n     by giving the right of suffrage to their mothers, wives and\r\n     daughters. But the sun went down, the polls were closed, and in\r\n     the early dawn of the next morning the women of Michigan learned\r\n     that their status as citizens of the United States had not been\r\n     advanced one iota by the liberal action of their governor, their\r\n     legislature, the appeals of the women nor the votes of 40,000 of\r\n     the best men of the State.\r\n\r\n     When the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the national\r\n     constitution were passed, many advocates of suffrage believed\r\n     that the right was conferred on women. In a letter to a State\r\n     convention held at that time, Wendell Phillips said:\r\n\r\n          The new phase of the woman movement--that claiming the right\r\n          to vote under the fourteenth amendment--is attracting great\r\n          attention in Washington. Whether it ever obtains judicial\r\n          sanction or not, it certainly gives a new and most effective\r\n          means of agitation. The argument of the minority report,\r\n          understood to be written by General Butler, is most able. *\r\n          * * The statement of the argument, and the array of cases\r\n          and authorities, are very striking. Nothing more cogent can\r\n          be imagined or desired. When two years ago a Western\r\n          advocate of woman's rights started this theory, we never\r\n          expected to see it assume such importance.\r\n\r\n     In accordance with this opinion, certain women resolved to apply\r\n     for registration, and offer their votes. On March 25, 1871,\r\n     Catherine A. F. Stebbins and Mrs. Nannette B. Gardner of Detroit\r\n     made the attempt to have their names regularly enrolled as\r\n     legally qualified voters. Mrs. Stebbins, accompanied by her\r\n     husband, made application in the fifth ward to have her name\r\n     registered, but was refused. She then proposed to her friend,\r\n     Mrs. Gardner, to make the trial in her ward, to which she\r\n     assented. Accordingly, they went to the first district of the\r\n     ninth ward, where Peter Hill was the enrolling officer. Mrs.\r\n     Gardner gave her name, saying she was a \"person\" within the\r\n     meaning of the fourteenth amendment, and that she was a widow,\r\n     and a tax-payer without representation. Mr. Hill, seeing the\r\n     justice of her demand, entered her name upon the register.\r\n\r\n     This action took some of the board of registration by surprise,\r\n     and a motion was made to erase her name, but was decided in the\r\n     negative.[316] The board was now asked for a decision in regard\r\n     to Mrs. Stebbins' name, as the question very naturally suggested\r\n     itself to the inspectors, if one woman can vote why not another.\r\n     Mrs. Stebbins was notified that her case would have a hearing.\r\n     When asked to submit her reasons for demanding the right to vote,\r\n     Mrs. S. stated that she asked it simply as the right of a human\r\n     being under the constitution of the United States. She had paid\r\n     taxes on personal and real estate, and had conformed to the laws\r\n     of the land in every respect. Since the fourteenth amendment had\r\n     enfranchised woman as well as the black man, she had the\r\n     necessary qualifications of an elector.\r\n\r\n     A long debate followed. Inspectors Bagg, Hill and Folsom argued\r\n     in favor of the petitioner; Allison, Brooks, Henderson and Hughes\r\n     against. The opposition confessed that the negro had voted before\r\n     the word \"white\" had been expunged from the State constitution;\r\n     but that was done from a \"political necessity.\" The question of\r\n     acceptance being put to vote, was negatived--13 to 10. This was\r\n     counted a victory, and stimulated the opposition to make another\r\n     effort to strike Mrs. Gardner's name from the register; but\r\n     failing in that, the board adjourned. There was now much\r\n     curiosity to know if Alderman Hill would have the nerve to stand\r\n     by his initiative; but with him the Rubicon was passed, and on\r\n     April 3, Messrs. Hill and Durfee accepted Mrs. Gardner's vote,\r\n     Mr. Bond protesting. The Detroit _Post_ gave the following\r\n     account:\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Gardner arrived at the polls of the first precinct of\r\n          the ninth ward at about half-past ten o'clock in a carriage,\r\n          accompanied by her son, a lad of ten years, Mrs. Starring\r\n          and Mrs. Giles B. Stebbins. Barely a dozen by-standers were\r\n          present, and the larger part of these were laboring men. No\r\n          demonstration followed the appearance of the ladies, the men\r\n          remaining quiet, and contenting themselves with comments\r\n          _sotto voce_ on this last political development, and with\r\n          speculations as to how the newly enfranchised would vote.\r\n          Mrs. Gardner presented herself at the polls with a vase of\r\n          flowers and also a prepared ballot, which she had decorated\r\n          with various appropriate devices. The inspectors asked the\r\n          questions usually put to all applicants, and her name being\r\n          found duly registered, her ballot was received and deposited\r\n          in the box. There was no argument, no challenge, no\r\n          variation from the routine traversed by each masculine\r\n          exerciser of the elective franchise. Mrs. Gardner voted, as\r\n          we understand; for the Republican candidates generally, with\r\n          one Democrat and one lady.\r\n\r\n     At Battle Creek, Mrs. Mary Wilson voted at the election of 1871.\r\n     When she registered, she was accompanied by her lawyer.\r\n\r\n     In the fall of 1872, Peter Hill again registered Mrs. Gardner,\r\n     and received her vote. Mr. Hill had been exposed to many\r\n     animadversions for his persistence, and as an acknowledgment of\r\n     her appreciation of his course, Mrs. Gardner presented him a silk\r\n     banner suitably inscribed. A city paper gives this account of it:\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Gardner, who has for years been a recognized voter in\r\n          the ninth ward of Detroit, again voted on Tuesday. She came\r\n          on foot, with Mrs. Stebbins, in a drenching rain, as no\r\n          carriage could be obtained. After voting, she presented a\r\n          beautiful banner of white satin, trimmed with gold fringe,\r\n          on which was inscribed, \"A Woman's Voting Hymn.\" The reverse\r\n          side, of blue silk, contained the dedication: \"To Peter\r\n          Hill, Alderman of the Ninth Ward, Detroit. First to Register\r\n          a Woman's Vote. By recognizing civil liberty and equality\r\n          for woman, he has placed the last and brightest jewel on the\r\n          brow of Michigan.\"\r\n\r\n     The city board now felt called upon to pass a vote of censure\r\n     upon Mr. Hill's action. The record runs thus:\r\n\r\n          Canvasser BAXTER: _Resolved_, That the act of the inspectors\r\n          of election of the first district of the ninth ward, in\r\n          receiving the vote of Mrs. Nannette B. Gardner at the\r\n          election just passed, is emphatically disapproved by this\r\n          board, on the ground that said act is a plain violation of\r\n          the election laws and constitution of the State of Michigan,\r\n          and is liable to lead to the grossest abuses and\r\n          complications.\r\n\r\n          Canvasser FULDA moved to lay the resolution on the\r\n          table--lost. Adopted as follows: _Yeas_--Langley, Flower,\r\n          House, Lichtenberg, Phelps, Parsons, Christian, Allison,\r\n          Buehle, Dullea, Daly, Barbier, Baxter--13. _Nays_--Wooley\r\n          and Fulda--2.\r\n\r\n          CHAS A. BORGMAN, _Secretary_.\r\n                                            PHILO PARSONS, _Chairman_.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Stebbins attempted to register at this election with the\r\n     same result as before. Upon the fourth of November she provided\r\n     herself with a sworn statement that she had been \"wrongfully\r\n     prevented\" the record of her name, and offered her vote at the\r\n     polls, calling attention to the \"enforcing act,\" provided for\r\n     such cases. It had no terror, however, for the valiant inspectors\r\n     of the fifth ward. In the fall of 1873, there was the following\r\n     correspondence between the board and the city counselor:\r\n\r\n          _Hon. D. C. Holbrook, City Counselor_: DEAR SIR:--Mrs. Giles\r\n          B. Stebbins has applied to this board and demands the right\r\n          to register. This board has declined to grant the request on\r\n          the ground that it does not believe her to be a legal\r\n          elector. Mrs. Stebbins would have all the required\r\n          qualifications of an elector, but for the fact of her being\r\n          a woman, and we therefore respectfully request that you\r\n          instruct us as to our duty in the premises. Very\r\n          respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                        S. B. WOOLLEY,\r\n                                        ALBERT BOTSFORD,\r\n                                          _Inspectors of First Ward_.\r\n\r\n          Woman cannot be enrolled or registered. Let her try it\r\n          on.[317]\r\n\r\n          _Oct. 24, 1873._      D. C. HOLBROOK, _City Counselor_.\r\n\r\n     In company with Mrs. H. J. Boutelle, Mrs. Stebbins offered her\r\n     vote in the fifth ward. Mr. Farwell was in favor of receiving it,\r\n     and wished to leave the question to a dozen responsible citizens\r\n     whom he called in as referees, but Col. Phelps would not be\r\n     influenced by the judgment of outsiders, and would not agree to\r\n     the proposal.[318]\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Gardner's name was retained on the ward voting list, and she\r\n     voted every year until she left the city for the education of her\r\n     children.\r\n\r\n     Before the University at Ann Arbor was opened to girls in 1869,\r\n     there had been several attempts to establish seminaries for girls\r\n     alone.[319] But they were not successful for several reasons. As\r\n     the State would not endow these private institutions, it made the\r\n     education of daughters very expensive, and fathers with\r\n     daughters, seeing their neighbors' sons in the State University\r\n     educated at the public expense, from financial considerations\r\n     were readily converted to the theory of coeducation. Again the\r\n     general drift of thought was in favor of coeducation throughout\r\n     the young western States. Then institutions of learning were too\r\n     expensive to build separate establishments for girls and boys,\r\n     and the number of boys able to attend through a collegiate course\r\n     could not fill the colleges ready for their reception. Hence from\r\n     all considerations it was a double advantage both to the State\r\n     and the girls, to admit them to the universities.\r\n\r\n     James A. B. Stone and Mrs. Lucinda H. Stone went to Kalamazoo in\r\n     1843, immediately after his election to take charge of the\r\n     Literary Institute. The name was afterwards changed to Kalamazoo\r\n     College. It is the oldest collegiate institute in the State,\r\n     having been chartered in 1833, and was designed from the outset\r\n     for both sexes. In the beginning it did not confer degrees, but\r\n     was the first, after Oberlin, to give diplomas to women.\r\n     Kalamazoo was an object of derision with some of the professors\r\n     of the University, because it was, they averred, of doubtful\r\n     gender. But a liberal-minded public grew more and more in favor\r\n     of epicene colleges. Literary seminaries had been established for\r\n     coeducation at Albion, Olivet, Adrian and Hillsdale, but some of\r\n     their charters were not exactly of a collegiate grade, and it was\r\n     doubtful whether under the new constitution, new college charters\r\n     would be granted, so that Kalamazoo and Ann Arbor had the field.\r\n     In January, 1845, a bill was introduced in the legislature to\r\n     organize literary institutions under a general law, no collegiate\r\n     degrees being allowed, unless on the completion of a curriculum\r\n     equal to that of the State University. The championship of this\r\n     bill fell to Dr. Stone, for while it would have no special effect\r\n     on Kalamazoo, it concerned the cause of coeducation in the State,\r\n     and the friends of the University made it a kind of test of what\r\n     the State policy should be in reference to the higher learning\r\n     for women. Dr. Tappan, then the able president of the University,\r\n     appeared at Lansing, supported by Rev. Dr. Duffield and a force\r\n     of able lawyers, to oppose it, and the far-seeing friends of\r\n     education in the legislature and in the lobby, rallied with Dr.\r\n     Stone for its support. For several weeks the contest was carried\r\n     on with earnestness, almost with bitterness, before the\r\n     legislative committees, before public meetings called in the\r\n     capitol for discussion, and on the floor of both houses. Dr.\r\n     Tappan made frantic appeals to Michigan statesmen not to disgrace\r\n     the State by such a law, which he prophesied would result in\r\n     \"preparatory schools for matrimony,\" and, shocking to\r\n     contemplate, young men would marry their classmates. Among the\r\n     friends of the measure present, were President Fairfield,\r\n     Professor Hosford, and Hon. Mr. Edsell, of Otsego, all graduates\r\n     of Oberlin, who had married their classmates, and \"been glad ever\r\n     since.\" They replied, \"What of it? Are not those who have met\r\n     daily in the recitation-room for four years, as well prepared to\r\n     judge of each other's fitness for life-companionship, as if they\r\n     had only met a few times at a ball, a dress party, or in private\r\n     interview?\" The legislature was an intelligent one, and the bill\r\n     passed amid great excitement, crowds of interested spectators\r\n     listening to the final discussions in the lower House. Governor\r\n     Bingham was friendly to the bill from the first. After its\r\n     passage, he sent a handsome copy signed by himself and other\r\n     officers, to Dr. and Mrs. Stone, at Kalamazoo, to be preserved as\r\n     a record of the Thermopylae fight for coeducation in Michigan.\r\n\r\n     Rev. E. O. Havens succeeded Dr. Tappan in the presidency, and was\r\n     supposed to be less strong in his prejudices, but when efforts\r\n     were made to open the doors to both sexes, he reported it\r\n     difficult and inexpedient, if not impossible. But he counted\r\n     without the broad-minded people of Michigan. A growing conviction\r\n     that the legislature would stop the appropriations to the\r\n     University unless justice was done to the daughters of the State,\r\n     finally brought about, at Ann Arbor, a change of policy. Under\r\n     the light that broke in upon their minds, the professors found\r\n     there was really no law against the admission of women to that\r\n     very liberal seat of learning. \"To be sure, they never had\r\n     admitted women, but none had formally applied.\" This, though\r\n     somewhat disingenuous, was received in good faith, and soon\r\n     tested by Miss Madeline Stockwell, who had completed half her\r\n     course at Kalamazoo, and was persuaded by Mrs. Stone to make\r\n     application at Ann Arbor. Mrs. Stone knew her to be a thorough\r\n     scholar, as far as she had gone, especially in Greek, which some\r\n     had supposed that women could not master. When she presented\r\n     herself for examination some members of the faculty were far from\r\n     cordial, but they were just, and she entered in the grade for\r\n     which she applied. She sustained herself ably in all her studies,\r\n     and when examined for her degree--the first woman graduate from\r\n     the literary department--she was commended as the peer of any of\r\n     her class-mates, and took an honorable part in the commencement\r\n     exercises. Moreover, she fulfilled the doleful prophecy of Dr.\r\n     Tappan, as women in other schools had done before her, and\r\n     married her class-mate, Mr. Turner, an able lawyer.\r\n\r\n     The statement by the faculty, or regents, that \"no woman had\r\n     formally applied,\" was untrue, as we shall see. The University\r\n     was opened to them in 1869; eleven years before, Miss Sarah\r\n     Burger, now Mrs. Stearns, made the resolve, the preparation, and\r\n     the application to enter the University of Michigan; and young as\r\n     she was, her clear-sightedness and courage called forth our\r\n     admiration. As a child, in Ann Arbor, from 1845, to 1852, she had\r\n     often attended the commencement exercises of the University, and\r\n     on those occasions had felt very unhappy, because all the culture\r\n     given to mind and heart and soul by this institution was given to\r\n     young men alone. It seemed a cruel injustice to young women that\r\n     they could not be there with their brothers, enjoying the same.\r\n     In connection with her efforts and those of her friends to enter\r\n     those enchanted portals, she bears grateful testimony to the\r\n     discussions on the question of woman's rights, as follows:\r\n\r\n          When it was my blessed privilege to attend a women's rights\r\n          convention at Cleveland, Ohio, in 1853,--and it was a grand\r\n          meeting--where dear Lucretia Mott, Ernestine L. Rose,\r\n          Frances D. Gage, Antoinette Brown, Lucy Stone, and others,\r\n          dwelt upon the manifold wrongs suffered by women, and called\r\n          upon them to awake and use their powers to secure justice to\r\n          all, I felt their words to mean that the Michigan University\r\n          as well as all others, should be opened to girls, and that\r\n          women themselves should first move in the matter.\r\n\r\n     Thus aroused, though but sixteen years old, she resolved at once\r\n     to make application for admission to the State University. Early\r\n     in the autumn of 1856, she entered the high school at Ann Arbor,\r\n     and studied Greek and Latin two years, preparatory to taking the\r\n     classical course. Four young ladies besides herself, recited with\r\n     the boys who were preparing for college, and they were all\r\n     declared by a university professor who had attended frequent\r\n     examinations, to stand head and shoulders in scholarship above\r\n     many of the young men. Miss Burger wishing as large a class as\r\n     possible to appeal for admission, wrote to a number of classical\r\n     schools for young women, asking cooeperation, and secured the\r\n     names of eleven[320] who would gladly apply with her. In the\r\n     spring of 1858, she sent a note to the regents, saying a class of\r\n     twelve young ladies would apply in June, for admission to the\r\n     University in September. A reporter said \"a certain Miss B. had\r\n     sent the regents warning of the momentous event.\" At the board\r\n     meeting in June, the young ladies presented their promised letter\r\n     of application, and received as reply, that the board should have\r\n     _more time to consider_. In September their reply was, that it\r\n     seemed inexpedient for the University to admit ladies at present.\r\n     In the meantime, a great deal had been said and done on the\r\n     subject; some members of the faculty had spoken in favor, some\r\n     against. University students, and citizens of Ann Arbor also\r\n     joined in the general discussion. The subject was widely\r\n     discussed in the press and on the platform; members of the\r\n     faculty and board of regents applied to the presidents of\r\n     universities east and west, for their opinions. The people of\r\n     Michigan, thus brought to consider the injustice of the exclusion\r\n     of their daughters from this State institution, there was offered\r\n     for signature during the winter of 1859, the following petition:\r\n\r\n          _To the Regents of the University of Michigan:_\r\n\r\n          The undersigned, inhabitants of ----, in the county of ----,\r\n          and State of Michigan, respectfully request that young women\r\n          may be admitted as students in the University, for the\r\n          following among other reasons: _First_--It is incumbent on\r\n          the State to give equal educational advantages to both\r\n          sexes. _Second_--All can be educated in the State University\r\n          with but little more expense than is necessary to educate\r\n          young men alone. _Third_--It will save the State from the\r\n          expenditure of half a million of dollars, necessary to\r\n          furnish young ladies in a separate institution with the\r\n          advantages now enjoyed by young men. _Fourth_--It will admit\r\n          young ladies at once to the benefits of the highest\r\n          educational privileges of the State.\r\n\r\n     Among the most active in lectures, debates, circulation of\r\n     petitions and general advocacy were James B. Gott, Judge Edwin\r\n     Lawrence, Giles B. Stebbins and O. P. Stearns, the last at that\r\n     time a student, since a lawyer, and the husband of Mrs. Sarah\r\n     Burger Stearns of Minnesota.\r\n\r\n     In the spring of 1859 formal application was again made to the\r\n     regents by a class of young ladies, only to receive the same\r\n     answer. But the discussion was not dropped; indeed, that was\r\n     impossible. Some of the most intelligent on this question believe\r\n     that the final admission of women to the University was due to a\r\n     resolve on the part of the people of the State to place upon the\r\n     board of regents, as the terms of old members expired, men well\r\n     known to be favorable. On the election of Professor Estabrook of\r\n     the State Normal School there was one more noble man \"for us,\"\r\n     who, with other new members, made a majority in favor of justice.\r\n     In the autumn of that year (1869) young women were admitted to\r\n     full privileges in Michigan University, and, like political\r\n     freedom in Wyoming, it has for years been confessed to have\r\n     yielded only beneficent results. As long ago, however, as the\r\n     first application was made (1858) women were permitted to attend\r\n     certain lectures. They could not join a class or read a book, but\r\n     it was the custom for them to go and listen to the beautiful and\r\n     highly instructive lectures by Professor Andrew D. White on\r\n     history, sculpture, and mediaeval architecture, and they highly\r\n     appreciated the privilege.\r\n\r\n     In March, 1869, President Havens said in the House of\r\n     Representatives at Lansing, \"he believed the University should be\r\n     opened to those who desired to obtain the benefit of the branches\r\n     of education which they could not obtain elsewhere.\" The Rev.\r\n     Gilbert Haven wrote to the American Society's meeting held in\r\n     Detroit, in 1874: \"I have been identified with your cause through\r\n     its evil report, and, I was going to add, good report, but that\r\n     part has not yet very largely set in. I also had the honor to\r\n     preside over the first ecclesiastical body that has, just now,\r\n     pronounced in your favor.\" This church assembly was the Methodist\r\n     State Association, which adopted the following in October, 1874,\r\n     without a negative vote, though several of the delegates refused\r\n     to vote:\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, The legislature of Michigan, at its recent session,\r\n          has submitted to the electors of the State a proposition to\r\n          change the State constitution so as to admit the women of\r\n          Michigan to the elective franchise; therefore,\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That this convention recognizes the action of\r\n          the legislature as a step toward a higher and purer\r\n          administration of the government of our country, and we hope\r\n          the provision will be adopted.\r\n\r\n     But the above was not the strongest utterance of Bishop Gilbert\r\n     Haven. Once at an equal rights society convention in the Academy\r\n     of Music, Brooklyn, where from floor to ceiling was gathered an\r\n     admirable and immense audience, with profound respect I heard\r\n     these memorable words:\r\n\r\n     \"I shall never be satisfied until a _black woman_ is seated in\r\n     the presidential chair of the United States,\" than which no more\r\n     advanced claim for the complete legal recognition of woman has\r\n     been made in our country.\r\n\r\n     In February, 1879, a spirited debate took place in the\r\n     legislature upon an amendment to the Episcopal Church bill, which\r\n     struck out the word \"male\" from the qualification of voters. The\r\n     Detroit _Post and Tribune_ says a vigorous effort was made to\r\n     defeat the measure, but without success. The justice of allowing\r\n     women to take part in church government was recognized, and the\r\n     amendment carried.\r\n\r\n     We have written persistently to leading women all over the State\r\n     for facts in regard to their local societies, and such responses\r\n     as have been received are embodied in this chapter. We give\r\n     interesting reports of a few of the county societies in which\r\n     much has been accomplished.\r\n\r\n     Of the work in Quincy Mrs. Sarah Turner says:\r\n\r\n          We never organized a woman suffrage society, although our\r\n          literary club has done much for the cause in a general way.\r\n          We had crowded houses on the occasions of a very able speech\r\n          from Elizabeth Cady Stanton and a most spirited one from\r\n          Miss Phoebe Couzins. For the past eight years a dozen\r\n          tax-paying women of this town have availed themselves of the\r\n          privilege granted them years ago, and voted at the school\r\n          meetings; and two years ago a woman was elected member of\r\n          the school-board.\r\n\r\n          Lansing reports for January, 1871, Mrs. Livermore's lecture\r\n          on \"The Reasons Why\" [women should be enfranchised]; the\r\n          organization of a city society with sixty members at the\r\n          close of the annual meeting of the State Association held in\r\n          that city in March; a lecture from Mrs. Stanton before the\r\n          Young Men's Association; the adoption of a declaration of\r\n          rights by the Ingham County Society, March, 1872, signed by\r\n          169 of the best people of the county. In 1874, of the many\r\n          meetings held those of Mrs. Stanton and Miss Couzins are\r\n          specially mentioned.\r\n\r\n          The St. Johns society, formed in 1872 with six members,\r\n          reported sixty at the State annual meeting of 1874, and also\r\n          $171.71, raised by fees and sociables, mainly expended in\r\n          the circulation of tracts and documents throughout the\r\n          county.\r\n\r\n     From Manistee Mrs. Fannie Holden Fowler writes:\r\n\r\n          In the campaign of 1874 Hon. S. W. Fowler, one of the\r\n          committee for Northern Michigan appointed by the State\r\n          Society, canvassed Manistee county and advocated the cause\r\n          through his paper, the _Times and Standard_. The election\r\n          showed the good of educational work, as a large vote was\r\n          polled in the towns canvassed by Mr. Fowler, two of them\r\n          giving a majority for the amendment. In an editorial, after\r\n          the election, Mr. Fowler said: \"The combined forces of\r\n          ignorance, vice and prejudice have blocked the wheels of\r\n          advancing civilization, and Michigan, once the proudest of\r\n          the sisterhood of States, has lost the opportunity of\r\n          inaugurating a reform; now let the women organize for a\r\n          final onset.\" However, no active suffrage work was done\r\n          until December 3, 1879, when Susan B. Anthony was induced to\r\n          stop over on her way from Frankfort to Ludington and give\r\n          her lecture, \"Woman Wants Bread; Not the Ballot.\" She was\r\n          our guest, and urged the formation of a society, and through\r\n          her influence a \"Woman's Department\" was added to the _Times\r\n          and Standard_, which is still a feature of the paper. In the\r\n          following spring (April, 1880), Elizabeth Cady Stanton gave\r\n          her lecture, \"Our Girls,\" with two \"conversations,\" before\r\n          the temperance women and others, which revived the courage\r\n          of the few who had been considering the question of\r\n          organization. A call was issued, to which twenty-three\r\n          responded, and the society was formed June 8, 1880,[321]\r\n          adopting the constitution of the National and electing\r\n          delegates to attend a convention to be held under the\r\n          auspices of that association the following week at Grand\r\n          Rapids. The society at once made a thorough canvass of the\r\n          city, which resulted in the attendance of seventy tax-paying\r\n          women at the school election in September, when the first\r\n          woman's vote was cast in Manistee county. Each succeeding\r\n          year has witnessed more women at the school election, until,\r\n          in 1883, they outnumbered the men, and would have elected\r\n          their ticket but for a fraud perpetrated by the old\r\n          school-board, which made the election void.\r\n\r\n          In August 1881, Mrs. May Wright Sewall delivered two\r\n          lectures in Manistee. In February 1882, a social,\r\n          celebrating Miss Anthony's birthday, was given by the\r\n          association at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Fowler, and was\r\n          voted a success. Through the untiring efforts of Mrs. Lucy\r\n          T. Stansell, who was also a member of the Ladies' Lever\r\n          League, Mrs. Elizabeth Boynton Harbert gave a Manistee\r\n          audience a rich treat in her \"Homes of Representative\r\n          Women,\" and her conversation on suffrage elicited much\r\n          interest.\r\n\r\n          During the autumn of 1882, petitions asking for municipal\r\n          suffrage were circulated. The venerable Josiah R. Holden of\r\n          Grand Rapids, father of Mrs. Fowler, then in his 88th year,\r\n          obtained the largest number of signatures to his petition of\r\n          any one in the State. A bill granting municipal suffrage to\r\n          women was drawn by Mrs. Fowler, introduced in the\r\n          legislature by Hon. George J. Robinson, and afterwards\r\n          tabled. At the session of 1885 a similar bill came within a\r\n          few votes of being carried.\r\n\r\n          In Grand Rapids there was no revival of systematic work\r\n          until 1880, when the National Association held a very\r\n          successful two days' convention in the city. In response to\r\n          a petition from the society, the legislature in the winter\r\n          of 1885 passed a law, giving to the tax-paying women of the\r\n          city the right to vote on school questions at the charter\r\n          elections. At the first meeting a hundred women were\r\n          present, and hundreds availed themselves of their new power\r\n          and voted at the first election.\r\n\r\n     The State Society held its annual meeting at Grand Rapids,\r\n     October 7, 8, 9, 1885, at which the address of welcome was given\r\n     by Mrs. Loraine Immen, president of the City Society,[322] and\r\n     responded to by Mrs. Stebbins of Detroit.[323]\r\n\r\n     The only religious sect in the world, unless we except the\r\n     Quakers, that has recognized the equality of woman, is the\r\n     Spiritualists. They have always assumed that woman may be a\r\n     medium of communication from heaven to earth, that the spirits of\r\n     the universe may breathe through her lips messages of loving\r\n     kindness and mercy to the children of earth. The Spiritualists in\r\n     our country are not an organized body, but they are more or less\r\n     numerous in every State and Territory from ocean to ocean. Their\r\n     opinions on woman suffrage and equal rights in all respects must\r\n     be learned from the utterances of their leading speakers and\r\n     writers of books, from their weekly journals, from resolutions\r\n     passed at large meetings, and from their usage and methods. A\r\n     reliable person widely familiar with Spiritualism since its\r\n     beginning in 1848, says that he has known but very few\r\n     Spiritualists who were not in favor of woman suffrage; that all\r\n     their representative men and women, and all their journals\r\n     advocate it, and have always done so; that expressions in its\r\n     favor in public meetings meet with hearty approval, and that men\r\n     and women have spoken on their platforms, and held official\r\n     places as co-workers in their societies through all of these\r\n     thirty-seven years. All this has taken place with very little\r\n     argument or discussion, but from an intuitive sense of the\r\n     justice and consequent benefits of such a course. A single\r\n     testimony, of many that might be given from their writings, must\r\n     suffice. In the _Religio-Philosophical Journal_, Chicago, Ill.,\r\n     November 22, 1884, its editor, J. C. Bundy, says: \"Although not\r\n     especially published in the interest of woman, this journal is a\r\n     stalwart advocate of woman's rights, and has for years given\r\n     weekly space to 'Woman and the Household,' a department under the\r\n     care of Mrs. Hester M. Poole, who has done much to encourage\r\n     women to renewed and persistent effort for their own\r\n     advancement.\"\r\n\r\n     It has been the custom of some of our journals to ask for letters\r\n     of greeting from distinguished people for New Year's day. We find\r\n     the following in the _Inter-Ocean_: \"Sojourner Truth, the Miriam\r\n     of the later Exodus, sends us this remarkable letter. She is the\r\n     most wonderful woman the colored race has ever produced, and thus\r\n     conveys her New Year's greeting to our readers:\r\n\r\n          \"DEAR FRIENDS: More than a hundred New Years have I seen\r\n          before this one, and I send a New Year's greeting to one and\r\n          all. We talk of a beginning, but there is no beginning but\r\n          the beginning of a wrong. All else is from God, and is from\r\n          everlasting to everlasting. All that has a beginning will\r\n          have an ending. God is without end, and all that is good is\r\n          without end. We shall never see God, only as we see him in\r\n          one another. He is a great ocean of love, and we live and\r\n          move in Him as the fishes in the sea, filled with His love\r\n          and spirit, and His throne is in the hearts of His people.\r\n          Jesus, the Son of God, will be as we are, if we are pure,\r\n          and we will be like him. There will be no distinction. He\r\n          will be like the sun and shine upon us, and we will be like\r\n          the sun and shine upon him; all filled with glory. We are\r\n          the children of one Father, and he is God; and Jesus will be\r\n          one among us. God is no respecter of persons, and we will be\r\n          as one. If it were not so, there would be jealousy. These\r\n          ideas have come to me since I was a hundred years old, and\r\n          if you, my friends, live to be a hundred years old, too, you\r\n          may have greater ideas than these. This has become a new\r\n          world. These thoughts I speak of because they come to me,\r\n          and for you to consider and look at. We should grow in\r\n          wisdom as we grow older, and new ideas will come to us about\r\n          God and ourselves, and we will get more and more the wisdom\r\n          of God. I am glad to be remembered by you, and to be able to\r\n          send my thoughts; hoping they may multiply and bear fruit.\r\n          If I should live to see another New Year's Day I hope to be\r\n          able to send more new thoughts.\r\n\r\n                                                 SOJOURNER TRUTH.\r\n\r\n          \"_Grand Rapids, Mich._, Dec. 26, 1880.\"\r\n\r\n     This was accompanied by a note from her most faithful friend,\r\n     Mrs. Frances W. Titus, relating matters of interest as to her\r\n     present circumstances. She also said: \"We have recently another\r\n     proof that she is over one hundred years old. Mention of the\r\n     'dark day' May 19, 1780, was made in her presence, when she said,\r\n     'I remember the dark day'; and gave a description of that\r\n     wonderful phenomenon. As the narrative of Sojourner's life has\r\n     long been before the public, we prefer to anything this latest\r\n     thought of hers, standing then on the verge of the life of the\r\n     spirit.\"\r\n\r\n     Sojourner was long a resident and laborer in reform in Michigan,\r\n     from which State she went out to the District of Columbia to\r\n     befriend her people, as well as to other distant fields. She went\r\n     to help feed and clothe the refugees in Kansas in 1879-80, and in\r\n     reaching one locality she rode nearly a hundred miles in a lumber\r\n     wagon. She closed her eventful life in Battle Creek, where she\r\n     passed her last days, having reached the great age of one hundred\r\n     and ten years.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Laura C. Haviland is another noble woman worthy of\r\n          mention. She has given a busy life to mitigating the\r\n          miseries of the unfortunate. She helped many a fugitive to\r\n          elude the kidnappers; she nursed the suffering soldiers, fed\r\n          the starving freedmen, following them into Kansas,[324] and\r\n          traveled thousands of miles with orphan children to find\r\n          them places in western homes. She and her husband at an\r\n          early day opened a manual-labor school, beginning by taking\r\n          nine children from the county-house, to educate them with\r\n          their own on a farm near Adrian. Out of her repeated\r\n          experiments, and petitions to the legislature for State aid,\r\n          grew at last the State school for homeless children at\r\n          Coldwater, where for years she gave her services to train\r\n          girls in various industries.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Sybil Lawrence, a woman of strong character, and\r\n          charming social qualities, exerted a powerful influence for\r\n          many years in Ann Arbor. Being in sympathy with the suffrage\r\n          movement, and in favor of coeducation, she did all in her\r\n          power to make the experiment a success, by her aid and\r\n          counsels to the girls who first entered the University. Her\r\n          mother, sister, and nieces made a charming household of\r\n          earnest women ready for every good work. Their services in\r\n          the war were indispensable, and their sympathies during the\r\n          trying period of reconstruction were all on the side of\r\n          liberty and justice.\r\n\r\n     There are many other noble women in Michigan worthy of mention\r\n     did space permit, such as Miss Emily Ward, a woman of remarkable\r\n     force of character and great benevolence; Mrs. Lucy L. Stout, who\r\n     has written many beautiful sentiments in prose and verse: Eliza\r\n     Legget and Florence Mayhew, identified with all reform movements;\r\n     Mrs. Tenney, the State librarian; and Mrs. Euphemia Cochrane, a\r\n     Scotch woman by birth, who loved justice and liberty, a staunch\r\n     friend alike of the slave and the unfortunate of her own sex.\r\n     Under her roof the advocates of abolition and woman suffrage\r\n     always found a haven of rest. Henry C. Wright, Wendell Phillips,\r\n     William Lloyd Garrison, Sojourner Truth, Theodore Tilton,\r\n     Frederick Douglass, Abbey Kelley and Stephen Foster could all\r\n     bear testimony to her generous and graceful hospitality. She was\r\n     president of the Detroit Woman Suffrage Association at the time\r\n     she passed from earth to a higher life.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[305] Having made many lyceum trips through Michigan, I have had\r\nseveral opportunities of meeting Mrs. Stone in her own quiet home,\r\nand I can readily understand the wide influence she exerted on the\r\nwomen of that State, and what a benediction her presence must have\r\nbeen in all the reform associations in which she took an active\r\npart. I always felt that Michigan would be a grand State in which\r\nto make the experiment of woman suffrage, especially as in\r\nMrs. Stone we had an enthusiastic coaedjutor. In paying this\r\nwell-deserved tribute to Mrs. Stone, I must not forget to mention\r\nthat Mrs. Janney of Flint, a woman of great executive ability,\r\nstarted the first woman's reading-room and library many years\r\nago.--[E.

Stout\r\nof Wayne, and the Rev. T. H. Stewart of Indiana.\r\n\r\n[315] It was in this campaign that an editor in a Kalamazoo journal\r\nsaid: \"That ancient daughter of Methuselah, Susan B. Anthony,\r\npassed through our city yesterday, on her way to the Plainwell\r\nmeeting, with a bonnet on her head looking as if she had recently\r\ndescended from Noah's ark.\" Miss Anthony often referred to this\r\ndescription of herself, and said, \"Had I represented 20,000 votes\r\nin Michigan, that political editor would not have known nor cared\r\nwhether I was the oldest or the youngest daughter of Methuselah, or\r\nwhether my bonnet came from the ark or from Worth's.--[E. C. S.\r\n\r\n[316] The inspectors voting were: _Yeas_--Adams, Baxter, Brooks,\r\nDullea, Henderson, Smith. _Nays_--Bragg, Balch, Barclay, Barry,\r\nBond, Christian, Hill, Hughes, Langley, Mahoney, O'Keefe,\r\nSutherland.\r\n\r\n[317] We can easily see how little the opponents who talk so much\r\nof chivalry, respect women or themselves, by the language they use\r\nwhen they are opposed on this very question.\r\n\r\n[318] Mrs. Boutelle and Mrs. Stebbins were in the polling place two\r\nor three hours, while Mr. Farwell made efforts to gain favorable\r\nopinions enough to convert Colonel Phelps; many excellent men were\r\nin favor of her vote. The ladies lunched from a daintily filled\r\nbasket, prepared by the wife of inspector Farwell.\r\n\r\n[319] Miss Abby Rogers, Miss Delia Rogers, Miss Emily Ward, and\r\nMiss Clapp, were all deeply interested in establishing a seminary\r\nwhere girls could have equal advantages with students in the\r\nuniversity. This seminary was in existence ten years, but without\r\nState aid the struggle was too great, and Miss Abby Rogers, the\r\nfounder, abandoned the undertaking.\r\n\r\n[320] The names of the eleven young women Mrs. Stearns is unable to\r\nrecall.\r\n\r\n[321] The officers of the Manistee Society are (1885): _President_,\r\nMrs. Lucy T. Stansell; _Corresponding Secretary_, Fannie Holden\r\nFowler; _Recording Secretary_, Miss Nellie Walker; _Treasurer_,\r\nMrs. Susan Seymour.\r\n\r\n[322] The officers of the Grand Rapids Society are: _President_,\r\nMrs. Cordelia F. Briggs; _Vice-Presidents_, Loraine Immen, Emma\r\nWheeler; _Treasurer_, Mrs. Henry Spring; _Secretary_, Mrs. J. W.\r\nAdams.\r\n\r\n[323] Following is a complete list of all officers elected in 1885:\r\n_President_, Mrs. Mary L. Doe of Carrollton; _Vice-President_, Mrs.\r\nLoraine Immen of Grand Rapids; _Recording Secretary_, Mrs. H.

Stafford of Milwaukee;\r\nNinth District, Col. S. W. Fowler of Manistee; Eleventh and Twelfth\r\nDistricts, Mrs. R. A. Campbell, Traverse City.\r\n\r\n[324] Spending the summer of 1865 at Leavenworth, I frequently\r\nvisited Mrs. Haviland, then busily occupied in ministering to the\r\nnecessities of the 10,000 refugees just then from the Southern\r\nStates. On May 29, I aided her in collecting provisions for the\r\nsteamer, which was to transport over a hundred men, women and\r\nchildren, for whom she was to provide places in Michigan. I shall\r\nnever forget that day nor the admiration and reverence I felt for\r\nthe magnanimity and self-sacrifice of that wonderful woman.--[S.

Julian--The\r\n     Journals--Gertrude Garrison.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was one of the first States to form a Woman Suffrage\r\nSociety[325] for thoroughly organized action, with a president,\r\nsecretary, treasurer, and constitution and by-laws. From October,\r\n1851, this association held annual meetings, sent petitions and\r\nappeals to the legislature, and had frequent hearings at the\r\ncapitol, diligently pressing the question of political equality for\r\nwoman for ten consecutive years. Then, although the society did not\r\ndisband, we find no record of meetings or aggressive action until\r\n1869, for here, as elsewhere, all other interests were forgotten in\r\nthe intense excitement of a civil war. But no sooner were the\r\nbattles fought, victory achieved, and the army disbanded, than\r\nwoman's protests against her wrongs were heard throughout the\r\nNorthern States; and in Indiana the same Amanda M. Way who took the\r\ninitiative step in 1851 for the first woman's convention, summoned\r\nher coaedjutors once more to action in 1869[326], and with the same\r\nplatform and officers renewed the work with added determination for\r\na final victory.\r\n\r\nFor this interesting chapter we are indebted to Mrs. May Wright\r\nSewall, who has patiently gathered and arranged this material, and\r\nlaid it, as a free gift, at our feet. Those who have ever attempted\r\nto unearth the most trivial incidents of history, will appreciate\r\nthe difficulties she must have encountered in this work, as well as\r\nin condensing all she desired to say within the very limited space\r\nallowed to this chapter. Mrs. Sewall writes:\r\n\r\n     The first convention after the war, June 8, 9, 1869, was held in\r\n     Masonic Hall, and continued two days. The Indianapolis _Journal_\r\n     devoted several columns daily to the proceedings, closing with\r\n     the following complimentary editorial:\r\n\r\n          As a deliberative assembly it compared favorably with the\r\n          best that have ever been conducted by our own sex. To say\r\n          that there was as much order, propriety and dignity as\r\n          usually characterizes male conventions of a political\r\n          character is but to put the matter in a very mild shape.\r\n          Whatever was said, was said with earnestness and for a\r\n          purpose, and while several times the debate was considerably\r\n          spiced, the ladies never fell below their brothers in sound\r\n          sense. We have yet to see any sensible man who attended the\r\n          convention whose esteem for woman has been lowered, while\r\n          very many have been converted by the captivating speeches of\r\n          Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Swank and Mrs. Livermore.\r\n\r\n     In the _Sentinel_ of June 11, 1869, an editorial appeared whose\r\n     evident object was to reaessure the public mind and to restore to\r\n     peace and confidence any souls that might have been agitated\r\n     during the convention by so unusual and novel an exercise as\r\n     thought. The nature of the sedative potion thus editorially\r\n     administered to an alarmed public may be inferred from this\r\n     sample:\r\n\r\n          No amount of human ingenuity can change the arrangement of\r\n          nature. The history of the race furnishes the evidence that\r\n          the species of man and woman are opposite. The distinctions\r\n          that now exist have existed from the time that the \"Lord God\r\n          caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam,\" and said: \"Thy\r\n          desire shall be to thy husband; he shall rule over thee.\"\r\n          This brief story comprises the history of man and woman, and\r\n          defines the relations which shall ever exist between them.\r\n          When woman ceases to be womanly, woman's rights associations\r\n          become her fitting province.\r\n\r\n     The editor of the _Journal_ at that time was Colonel W. R.\r\n     Holloway, the present very liberal manager of the _Times_. The\r\n     editor of the _Sentinel_ was Joseph J. Bingham. The State was\r\n     then Republican, and as the organ of that party the _Journal_\r\n     probably had the larger number of readers.\r\n\r\n     The State Woman Suffrage Association convened in Indianapolis,\r\n     June 8, 1870, and held a two days' meeting. The _Journal_\r\n     contains, as usual, a full report. The _Sentinel's_ tone is quite\r\n     different from that which distinguished its utterances the\r\n     preceding year. Its reports are full and perfectly respectful.\r\n     This convention is memorable as that at which the Indiana Society\r\n     became auxiliary to the American Association. The records show\r\n     that this union was accomplished by a majority of _one_, the\r\n     ballot on the proposition standing 15 for and 14 against. As soon\r\n     as the union was thus effected the following was adopted:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That this association is in favor of the union\r\n          of the National and American Associations as soon as\r\n          practicable.\r\n\r\n     On the same day Judge Bradwell of Chicago submitted a resolution\r\n     favoring the union of the two national societies, which was laid\r\n     on the table. Of the annual meetings from 1871 to 1878 the\r\n     Indianapolis papers contain no reports, save the briefest mention\r\n     of those of 1873-4. From 1878 to 1885 short but fair reports may\r\n     be found. Since 1870, the conventions of this society[327] have\r\n     been held in different towns throughout the State.[328] The\r\n     minutes show that the propriety of withdrawing from the American\r\n     Association and remaining independent was brought before the\r\n     convention of 1871, under the head of _special business_; that it\r\n     was decided to postpone action until the next annual meeting, and\r\n     to make the matter of withdrawal a special order of business, but\r\n     it does not appear that from that time the subject has ever been\r\n     broached. At the annual meeting of 1875, held at a time when\r\n     preparations for celebrating our national centennial were in\r\n     progress, the following resolution was passed:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That we congratulate the voters of the United\r\n          States on their enjoyment of the right of suffrage, and\r\n          commend them for the great centenary celebration of the\r\n          establishment of that right, which they are about to have.\r\n          But we do earnestly protest against the action of the\r\n          Indiana legislature by which it made appropriations for that\r\n          purpose of moneys collected by taxing women's property.\r\n\r\n     In November, 1878, the ninth annual meeting of the American\r\n     Association was held in Indianapolis, by invitation from the\r\n     State Society.[329]\r\n\r\n     In the month of March, 1878, some very mysterious whisperings\r\n     advertised the fact that there was to be a meeting of the ladies\r\n     of Indianapolis known to have \"advanced ideas\" concerning their\r\n     sex. In response to a secretly circulated summons, there met at\r\n     No. 18 Circle Hall nine women and one man, who, though not\r\n     mutually acquainted, were the most courageous of those to whom\r\n     the call had come. Probably each of the ten often thinks with\r\n     amusement of the suspicious glances with which they regarded one\r\n     another. As a participant, I may say that the company had the air\r\n     of a band of conspirators. Had we convened consciously to plot\r\n     the ruin of our domestic life, which opponents predict as the\r\n     result of woman's enfranchisement, we could not have looked more\r\n     guilty or have moved about with more unnatural stealth. That\r\n     demeanor I explain as an unconscious tribute to what \"Madam\r\n     Grundy\" would have thought had she known of our conclave.\r\n\r\n     At that meeting one point only was definitely settled; which was,\r\n     whether the new society should take a name which would conceal\r\n     from the public its primary object, or one which would clearly\r\n     advertise it. The honesty of the incipient organization was\r\n     vindicated by its deciding upon the latter. I do not record in\r\n     detail the initiative steps of this flourishing society in order\r\n     to awaken in its members any humiliating memories, but because\r\n     the fact that ten conscientious, upright persons could thus\r\n     secretly convene in an obscure room, and that such a question\r\n     could agitate them for more than two hours, is the best\r\n     indication that could be given of the conservative atmosphere\r\n     which enveloped Indianapolis, even as late as 1878. The next\r\n     meeting was appointed for April 2, at the residence of Mrs.\r\n     Zerelda G. Wallace. Notices were inserted in the papers, and in\r\n     the meantime some pains was taken to secure not only the presence\r\n     of persons who had not previously been identified with any reform\r\n     movement, but also that of some well-known friends. It was\r\n     attended by twenty-six men and women, representing various\r\n     religious and political parties, most of whom enjoyed the\r\n     advantages of education and social position, and resulted in a\r\n     permanent organization under a constitution whose first article\r\n     is as follows:\r\n\r\n          This organization shall be known as the Indianapolis Equal\r\n          Suffrage Society, and shall consist of such men and women as\r\n          are willing to labor for the attainment of equal rights at\r\n          the ballot-box for all citizens on the same conditions.\r\n\r\n     On the principle that that which has some restrictions is most\r\n     desired, membership was at first hedged about with certain\r\n     formalities. While most reform organizations welcome as members\r\n     all who will pay their annual fee and subscribe to the\r\n     constitution, this society requires that the names of candidates\r\n     be presented at one meeting and formally balloted on at the next,\r\n     thus providing a month for consideration. Since 1878 this\r\n     society[330] has held forty-three public meetings, and\r\n     distributed throughout the city several thousand tracts. At\r\n     intervals the society has engaged speakers from abroad. Miss\r\n     Anthony gave her \"Bread and Ballot\" to a large audience in\r\n     Masonic Hall, and many date their conversion from that evening.\r\n     Mrs. Stanton has appeared twice under the auspices of the\r\n     society. On the first occasion it secured for her the court-room\r\n     in which the upper house of the general assembly was then\r\n     sitting. Tickets of admission were sent to all the members of\r\n     both houses. Her lecture on \"The Education of Girls,\" made a\r\n     profound impression. On her second appearance she spoke in the\r\n     First Christian Church, on \"Boys.\" For Miss Frances E. Willard,\r\n     Robert's Park Church was obtained, and thus suffrage principles\r\n     were presented to a new class of minds. Mrs. J. Ellen Foster\r\n     spoke on \"Women before the Law,\" in the Criminal-court room. The\r\n     society made every effort to secure the general attendance of\r\n     members of the bar. Before one of its regular meetings in the\r\n     Christian chapel, Mrs. Louise V. Boyd read a very bright paper on\r\n     \"A Cheerful Outlook for Women.\" At its present parlors, Mrs.\r\n     Harbert delivered an address for the benefit of the suffrage\r\n     campaign in Oregon.\r\n\r\n     In May, 1880, this society invited the National Association to\r\n     hold its annual convention in Indianapolis. Entertainment was\r\n     provided for eighty-seven delegates, besides the friends who came\r\n     from different parts of the State. In Park Theatre, the largest\r\n     auditorium of the city, eloquent voices for two days pleaded the\r\n     cause of freedom. The reports in the city press were full and\r\n     fair, and the editorials commendatory. The fact that the\r\n     _Sentinel_ contained a long editorial advocating the doctrines of\r\n     equal suffrage, shows the progress since 1869. The evening after\r\n     the convention a reception was given to the members and friends\r\n     of the National Association in the spacious parlors of Mrs. John\r\n     C. New.\r\n\r\n     From its origin the Indianapolis society has held aloof from all\r\n     formal alliances. Thus it has been free to work with individuals\r\n     and organizations that have woman suffrage for their aim. It\r\n     habitually sends delegates to the State annual conventions, and\r\n     in those of the American and National it is usually represented.\r\n\r\n     In December, 1880, the society issued a letter, secured its\r\n     publication in the leading papers of the State, and addressed a\r\n     copy to each member of the General Assembly, in order to advise\r\n     that body that there were women ready to watch their official\r\n     careers and to demand from them the consideration of just claims:\r\n\r\n                                   INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 22, 1880.\r\n\r\n          DEAR SIR: The Equal Suffrage Society of Indianapolis, in\r\n          behalf of citizens of Indiana who believe that liberty to\r\n          exercise the right of suffrage should neither be granted nor\r\n          denied on the ground of sex, would respectfully notify you\r\n          that during the next session of the State legislature it\r\n          will invite the attention of that body to the consideration\r\n          of what is popularly called \"The Suffrage Question.\" The\r\n          society will petition the legislature to devote a day to\r\n          hearing, from representative advocates of woman suffrage,\r\n          appeals and arguments for such legislation as may be\r\n          necessary to abolish the present unjust restriction of the\r\n          elective franchise to one sex, and to secure to women the\r\n          free exercise of the ballot, under the same conditions and\r\n          such only, as are imposed upon men. To this matter we ask\r\n          your unprejudiced attention, that when our cause shall be\r\n          brought before the legislature its advocates may have your\r\n          cooeperation.\r\n\r\n          Very respectfully yours,    ZERELDA G. WALLACE, _President_.\r\n\r\n          MAY WRIGHT SEWALL, _Secretary_,\r\n\r\n          By order of the Equal Suffrage Society of Indianapolis.\r\n\r\n     The society has lately taken a new departure, giving lunches,\r\n     parties and literary entertainments, to which invitations[331]\r\n     are issued, by the officers, thus becoming a factor in the social\r\n     life of the city. The invitation, programme, and press comments\r\n     of its last entertainment indicate the character of these\r\n     reuenions, and the esteem in which they are held. These occasions\r\n     have been the means of securing for the society greater popular\r\n     favor than it has hitherto enjoyed. At the conclusion of the\r\n     formal toasts, the president called upon Gov. Albert G. Porter,\r\n     who had come in a few minutes before. He thanked the meeting for\r\n     its reference to what he had done for the cause of equal\r\n     suffrage, and announced that while he remained governor of\r\n     Indiana he would do all he could for the rights of women.[332] He\r\n     referred to the progress made, and to the refining influence that\r\n     women would have on political matters. Of all the social\r\n     entertainments given, none has secured more converts than the\r\n     celebration of Susan B. Anthony's sixty-second birthday. The\r\n     arrangements for this event were placed in the hands of Mrs. Mary\r\n     E.N. Carey and Mrs. May Wright Sewall. The following account,\r\n     prepared by the author of this chapter for the Indianapolis\r\n     _Times_ of February 18, 1882, will sufficiently indicate the\r\n     spirit of the occasion:\r\n\r\n          The anniversary was a unique event. A number of invitations\r\n          were issued to citizens interested in suffrage who were not\r\n          formally connected with the association. As a result, on the\r\n          evening of February 15, there were gathered in the spacious\r\n          parlors of Dr. Carey's hospitable home, one hundred and\r\n          fifty persons representing the best circles of Indianapolis\r\n          society. A portrait of Miss Anthony rested upon an easel,\r\n          conspicuously placed, that all might see the serene face of\r\n          the woman who for thirty years has preached the gospel of\r\n          political freedom, and expounded the constitution of the\r\n          United States in favor of justice to all. The programme was\r\n          somewhat informal, all but two of the speeches[333] being\r\n          spontaneous expressions of admiration for Miss Anthony and\r\n          her fidelity to principle. There were two regrets connected\r\n          with the programme. These were caused by the absence of Gov.\r\n          Porter and Hon. Schuyler Colfax; but the gracious presence\r\n          of Mrs. Colfax was a reminder of her husband's fidelity to\r\n          our cause, and Mrs. Porter's sympathetic face was a scarcely\r\n          less potent support than would have been a speech from the\r\n          governor. Just before the close of the meeting the following\r\n          telegram was sent to Miss Anthony:\r\n\r\n          _Susan B. Anthony, Tenafly, New Jersey_.\r\n\r\n          The Indianapolis Equal Suffrage Society, in meeting\r\n          assembled with many friends sends you greeting on this\r\n          anniversary occasion, in recognition of your devotion to the\r\n          cause of women.\r\n\r\n                                   MAY WRIGHT SEWALL, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n     To report the details of this social gathering would be\r\n     wearisome, but some reflections to which the occasion gave rise\r\n     may be permitted. One lady upon seeing the invitation to the\r\n     meeting exclaimed: \"This little bit of paper is an indication of\r\n     a higher civilization than I supposed we had yet entered upon.\r\n     Until recently it has been like the betrayal of a secret for a\r\n     woman, particularly for an unmarried woman, to have a birthday.\"\r\n     This exclamation but expresses a historical fact and a prophetic\r\n     truth. So long as woman's only value depended upon physical\r\n     charms, the years which destroyed them were deemed enemies. The\r\n     fact that an unmarried woman's sixty-second birthday can be\r\n     celebrated, shows the dawning of the idea that the loss of youth\r\n     and its fresh beauty may be more than compensated by the higher\r\n     charms of intellectual attainments. The time will never come when\r\n     women, or men either, will delight in the possession of\r\n     crows-feet, gray hairs and wrinkles; but the time will come, aye,\r\n     and now is, when they will view these blemishes as but a petty\r\n     price to pay for the joy of new knowledge, for the deeper joy of\r\n     closer contact with humanity, and for the deepest joy of worthy\r\n     work well done.\r\n\r\n    The first legislative hearing since 1860, was that granted\r\n    January, 1871, to Miss Amanda Way and Mrs. Emma B. Swank. The two\r\n    houses received them in joint session, the lieutenant-governor and\r\n    speaker of the house occupying the speaker's desk. Mr. William\r\n    Cumback introduced Miss Way, who read the following memorial:\r\n\r\n          _Mr. President and Gentlemen_--We come before you as a\r\n          committee appointed by the Woman Suffrage Association to\r\n          memorialize your honorable body in behalf of the women of\r\n          Indiana. We ask you to take the necessary steps to so amend\r\n          the State constitution as to secure to women the right of\r\n          suffrage. We believe the extension of the full rights of\r\n          citizenship to all the people of the State, is in accordance\r\n          with the fundamental principles of a just government. We\r\n          believe that as woman has an equal interest with man in all\r\n          public questions, she should therefore have an equal voice\r\n          in their decision. We believe that as woman's life,\r\n          prosperity and happiness are equally dependent upon the\r\n          order and morality of society, she should have an equal\r\n          voice in the laws regulating her surroundings. We believe\r\n          that as woman is human, she has human needs and rights, and\r\n          as she is held responsible to law, she should have an equal\r\n          voice in electing her law-makers.\r\n\r\n          We believe that the interests of man and woman are equally\r\n          improved in securing to both equal education, a place in the\r\n          trades and professions, equal honor and dignity everywhere;\r\n          and as the first step to this end is equality before the\r\n          law, we, your petitioners, ask that you extend to the women\r\n          of Indiana the right of suffrage, and thus enable one-half\r\n          the citizens of the State to protect themselves in their\r\n          most sacred rights.\r\n\r\n     Miss Way spoke briefly to the points in the memorial, urging the\r\n     legislators to give to women the same chances for improvement,\r\n     the same means for defense, and the same weapons for protection\r\n     that they have secured to themselves. Mrs. Swank also made a\r\n     logical and eloquent speech. No action was taken by the\r\n     legislature.\r\n\r\n     On January 22, 1875, the two houses of the General Assembly\r\n     convened in joint session, to receive petitions from the\r\n     \"Temperance Women of Indiana,\" who were on this occasion\r\n     represented by Mrs. Zerelda G. Wallace, Mrs. Avaline and Mrs.\r\n     Robinson, who had been appointed by the State Temperance\r\n     Association. Mrs. Wallace read a memorial and stated that it was\r\n     signed by 10,000 women, and then argued its various points and\r\n     pleaded for the action of the \"Honorable Body.\" Mrs. Avaline and\r\n     Mrs. Robinson followed in briefer, but not less earnest appeals.\r\n     The only answer elicited by these ladies was the assurance made\r\n     by Dr. Thompson, a member of the Senate, that he and his\r\n     colleagues were there, \"not to represent their _consciences_, but\r\n     to represent their _constituents_,\" whose will was directly\r\n     opposed to the petition offered.\r\n\r\n     On January 3, 1877, a resolution to the effect that the\r\n     fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the Constitution of the\r\n     United States give the ballot to women, came to its third reading\r\n     in the lower House. On that occasion, Mrs. Wallace and Dr. Mary\r\n     F. Thomas represented the women of Indiana, and Mrs. Mary A.\r\n     Livermore was present to lend the assistance of her oratory. The\r\n     speeches created a profound impression, but neither native nor\r\n     foreign eloquence was able to secure the requisite vote. When the\r\n     ayes and nays were called, the resolution was lost--51 to 22.\r\n\r\n     On February 24, 1879, once again in joint session, the General\r\n     Assembly received a committee appointed by the State Association\r\n     and the Equal Suffrage Society of Indianapolis, to support\r\n     woman's claim to the ballot. Mrs. Wallace, Dr. Mary F. Thomas,\r\n     Mary E. Haggart and Amy E. Dunn, each spoke at length on the\r\n     points clearly set forth in the memorial. Whatever arguments\r\n     could reach the intellect, whatever could touch the\r\n     sensibilities, were urged by these ladies on that occasion, and\r\n     the gentlemen did not fail to compliment their abilities,\r\n     although the exercise of them had no palpable effect upon\r\n     legislation.\r\n\r\n     Before the General Assembly of 1880-81, had convened, it was\r\n     known by its members-elect that the women of the State would be a\r\n     constant factor in their deliberations. They had been notified of\r\n     this intention by the circular letter from the City Society, and\r\n     by the published fact that the State Association had already\r\n     appointed representatives, whose duty it should be to secure a\r\n     hearing for such an amendment to the constitution of the State as\r\n     should enable women to vote. As soon as the legislature\r\n     assembled, committees on women's claims were appointed in both\r\n     branches; Simeon P. Yancey being the chairman of the Senate, and\r\n     J. M. Furnas of the House, committee. Two points had been\r\n     determined upon. These were to try to secure the passage of a\r\n     bill which should immediately authorize women to vote for\r\n     presidential electors, and such an amendment to the constitution\r\n     of the State as should enable women to exercise the right of\r\n     suffrage on all questions.\r\n\r\n     In connection with the first of these points the name of Helen M.\r\n     Gougar deserves especial mention. At the Washington convention of\r\n     the American Association, Mr. Blackwell suggested that the States\r\n     try to secure the electoral ballot for women, and as soon as Mrs.\r\n     Gougar returned she urged the members of the legislature to take\r\n     the matter up. At her suggestion, Dr. Mary F. Thomas addressed a\r\n     letter to W. D. Wallace, esq., a prominent lawyer of Lafayette,\r\n     asking him if, in his opinion, the extension of the electoral\r\n     ballot to women would be incompatible with the present\r\n     constitution of the State; in reply to this Mr. Wallace set forth\r\n     an exhaustive argument,[334] proving the entire constitutionality\r\n     of such an act. Five thousand were printed and gratuitously\r\n     distributed throughout the State.\r\n\r\n     The Committee on Women's Claims in both Houses met at sundry\r\n     times with members of the Suffrage Association to discuss the\r\n     merits of these bills and to become familiar with the arguments.\r\n     During the regular session Mrs. Wallace and Mrs. Gougar spent two\r\n     consecutive weeks in attendance at the legislature, watching the\r\n     attitude of the different members and lobbying, in the good sense\r\n     of that word. The immediate object was to secure the passage of\r\n     the electoral bill, for that once gained, and women by act of the\r\n     legislature made voters upon the most important question, it was\r\n     reasonably thought that the passage of the amendment would be\r\n     thereby facilitated. A hearing was granted on February 16, 1881,\r\n     and the House took a recess to listen to the speeches of the\r\n     women appointed by the State Association, Mrs. Haggart and Mrs.\r\n     Gougar. The next day, February 17, the Senate afforded a similar\r\n     opportunity, and the same ladies addressed that body.\r\n\r\n     In addition to the faithful exertions of Mrs. Wallace and Mrs.\r\n     Gougar, and the public hearing granted by both houses, much quiet\r\n     but most effective work was done with individual members. To no\r\n     one is more due than to Paulina T. Merritt, whose reputation for\r\n     intelligent charity is widely known. Mrs. Merritt was a frequent\r\n     attendant upon the sessions of the legislature and her untiring\r\n     efforts in private conversations with members were invaluable. In\r\n     spite of all these influences, when the electoral bill was\r\n     brought to a vote upon its third reading, it was lost on the\r\n     ground that it was unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n     At the special session all efforts centered upon the bill for\r\n     amending section 2, of article II., of the State constitution, so\r\n     as to give women the right to vote in all elections. Mrs. Wallace\r\n     and Mrs. Gougar gave another week to the work, and on April 7 the\r\n     bill was brought to a vote in the House, and passed--ayes 62,\r\n     nays 24; in the Senate, on April 8, it also passed--ayes 25, nays\r\n     18; and so the first entrenchment was won.\r\n\r\n     No one believed that the bill to amend the constitution would\r\n     have passed had it not been preceded by the battle over the\r\n     electoral bill and the consequent education of the General\r\n     Assembly in regard to this great question of political rights.\r\n     Immediately a conference was held as to the proper manner of\r\n     expressing our gratitude to the committees on women's political\r\n     claims. It was at first thought the recognition should come from\r\n     the Equal Suffrage Society, but it was finally considered wiser\r\n     to have a reception given the honorable body by a voluntary\r\n     committee of women who should act quite independently of any\r\n     society.[335]\r\n\r\n     The passage of the amendment by the legislature of 1881 gave the\r\n     advocates of our cause a common objective point, and the efforts\r\n     of all during the two years immediately succeeding were directed\r\n     toward securing the election of such a legislature as might be\r\n     relied upon to repass the bill in 1883. The State society at its\r\n     annual meeting enlarged its central committee and instructed it\r\n     to arrange meetings in various parts of the State, to send out\r\n     speakers, and to organize local societies.[336] This committee\r\n     prepared a letter, for general distribution, indicating to the\r\n     women of the State their duty in the premises, and suggesting\r\n     various lines of work. Blanks for a special petition to the\r\n     General Assembly were sent to every township, which were\r\n     industriously circulated and numerously signed.\r\n\r\n     In the spring of 1882 the officers of the State society issued a\r\n     call for a mass-meeting, to which \"all women within the\r\n     boundaries of the State who believed in equal suffrage, or were\r\n     interested in the fate of the pending amendment,\" were invited.\r\n     The meeting was held on May 19, at the Grand Opera House, and\r\n     the attendance exceeded the most extravagant hopes of those who\r\n     had called it. If any came to scoff, they remained to participate\r\n     with pride in this remarkable convention, which is yet frequently\r\n     referred to as the largest and most impressive meeting ever held\r\n     in the Hoosier capital. The call had invited those who could not\r\n     attend the meeting to manifest their sympathy by sending\r\n     postal-cards to the corresponding secretary. These were received\r\n     in such numbers for several days that Mrs. Adkinson and the\r\n     half-dozen clerks appointed to assist her in counting them,\r\n     unable to bring in a full report, announced at the close of the\r\n     evening session, that having reached 5,000, they desisted from\r\n     further enumeration.\r\n\r\n     No effort was spared to make the demonstration truly\r\n     representative of the suffrage interest throughout the State. All\r\n     the sessions were presided over by Mrs. Sewall, who called the\r\n     roll by congressional districts, some one of whose\r\n     representatives responded. The ease and dignity with which women,\r\n     many of whom had never spoken before any audience save their own\r\n     neighbors gathered in Sunday-school or prayer-meeting, reported\r\n     the status of their respective communities on the suffrage\r\n     question, was matter of astonishment as well as of\r\n     admiration.[337] So exceptional in all regards was the conduct of\r\n     the meeting that the papers united in expressing surprise at the\r\n     strength of the suffrage sentiment in the State as indicated by\r\n     the mass-convention.\r\n\r\n     This meeting of May 19, 1882, struck the key on which the friends\r\n     in the State spoke during the summer and fall of that year. Large\r\n     numbers of societies were organized and numerous meetings held;\r\n     the immediate object being to secure the election of a\r\n     legislature that should vote to submit the amendment passed by\r\n     the General Assembly of 1881 to the decision of what is mis-named\r\n     \"a popular vote.\" The degree to which this action influenced the\r\n     politicians of the State cannot be accurately known, but we are\r\n     compelled to believe that it was one of the causes which induced\r\n     the Republicans in convention assembled to declare for the\r\n     \"submission of the pending amendments.\" The Republican State\r\n     convention was held August 8, 1882, and the first plank in the\r\n     platform reads thus:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved, First_--That reposing trust in the people as the\r\n          fountain of power, we demand that the pending amendments to\r\n          the constitution shall be agreed to and submitted by the\r\n          next legislature to the voters of the State for their\r\n          decision thereon. These amendments were not partisan in\r\n          their origin, and are not so in character, and should not be\r\n          made so in voting upon them. Recognizing the fact that the\r\n          people are divided in sentiment in regard to the propriety\r\n          of their adoption or rejection, and cherishing the right of\r\n          private judgment, we favor the submission of these\r\n          amendments at a special election, so that there may be an\r\n          intelligent decision thereon, uninfluenced by partisan\r\n          issues.\r\n\r\n     At the mass-meeting of May 19, Mrs. P. T. Merritt of\r\n     Indianapolis, Mrs. M. E. M. Price of Kokomo, and Mrs. J. C.\r\n     Ridpath of Greencastle were appointed as delegates to the\r\n     different political State conventions. As a Republican, Mrs.\r\n     Merritt was received with great courtesy and accorded time to\r\n     speak. Her address was characterized by sound logic and dignity\r\n     of expression, and was reported in full with the rest of the\r\n     proceedings of the Republican convention. As a prohibition\r\n     amendment had also been passed by the legislature of 1881, the\r\n     interests of suffrage and prohibition in the campaign of 1882\r\n     were identical. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union of Indiana\r\n     sent Mrs. Helen M. Gougar to the Republican State convention, by\r\n     which she was respectfully received and which she ably addressed.\r\n\r\n     The advocates of suffrage did not content themselves during the\r\n     summer of 1882 by merely holding suffrage meetings proper, and\r\n     addressing political bodies, but they sought every opportunity to\r\n     reach the ears of the people for whatever purpose convened. The\r\n     Equal Suffrage Society received from the managers of the Acton\r\n     camp-meeting a place on their programme; accordingly Mrs. Haggart\r\n     and Mrs. Gougar, as delegates, addressed immense audiences. Both\r\n     of these ladies labored indefatigably, discussing the question of\r\n     submission of the amendments before Sunday-school conventions,\r\n     teachers' associations, agricultural fairs, picnics and\r\n     assemblies of every name. Others rendered less conspicuous, but\r\n     not less earnest or constant service; and when the political\r\n     campaign proper opened, it was evident that every candidate would\r\n     firmly and unreservedly answer the challenge: \"Submission, or\r\n     non-submission?\"\r\n\r\n     For the first time in the history of Indiana, women were employed\r\n     by party managers to address political meetings and advocate the\r\n     election of candidates. Mrs. Gougar addressed Republican rallies\r\n     at various points; she and Mrs. Haggart together made a canvass\r\n     of Tippecanoe county on behalf of the Republican candidate for\r\n     representative in the General Assembly, Captain W. De Witt\r\n     Wallace, who was committed not only to the submission of the\r\n     amendments, but also to the advocacy of both woman suffrage and\r\n     prohibition. The animosity of the liquor league was aroused, and\r\n     this powerful association threw itself against submission. The\r\n     result was the election of a legislature containing so large a\r\n     Democratic majority that there was no ground for hoping that the\r\n     amendments would be re-passed and sent to the voters of the State\r\n     for final adoption or rejection.\r\n\r\n     Though the submission of the amendments was one of the chief\r\n     issues in the campaign, many candidates who pledged themselves on\r\n     the ground that they involved questions which it was the\r\n     privilege of the voters to decide, reserved their own opinions\r\n     upon their merits. There were, however, candidates who openly\r\n     espoused woman suffrage _per se_.[338] Knowing that a majority of\r\n     the members of the General Assembly were pledged to vote down the\r\n     pending amendments, the friends tacitly agreed to maintain a\r\n     dignified silence toward that body concerning them. The Suffrage\r\n     Society at the capital, however, appointed a committee[339] to\r\n     watch the interests of woman in the legislature; and through its\r\n     influence, special committees on women's claims were obtained in\r\n     both Houses. Disappointed by the result in the legislature of\r\n     1883, but not discouraged, the society continued to labor with\r\n     undiminished zeal, and sought every legitimate opportunity to\r\n     prove woman a factor in State politics.\r\n\r\n     Several weeks prior to the Republican nominating convention at\r\n     Chicago, June 3, 1884, this society appointed committees to\r\n     correspond with each of the gentlemen prominently named as\r\n     candidates for nomination to the office of president, and also\r\n     appointed committees[340] to press upon the attention of the\r\n     different parties the political claims of women. The society\r\n     instructed each committee to carry on its work according to the\r\n     united judgment of its members and continue it until the close of\r\n     the legislative session of 1885. The committee appointed to\r\n     communicate with the Republicans addressed a letter to each of\r\n     the thirty delegates sent by Indiana to the nominating convention\r\n     at Chicago. They also addressed letters to the Republican State\r\n     central committee, and through the courtesy of Mr. John\r\n     Overmeyer, chairman, they were given an opportunity to appear\r\n     before the committee on resolutions. Mrs. Sewall presented a\r\n     resolution, and in a brief speech urged its adoption and\r\n     incorporation into the platform of the Republican party. Mrs.\r\n     Merritt and Mrs. Sewall were offered an opportunity to speak\r\n     before the convention, which they declined in the belief that it\r\n     was a greater gain to the cause to appear before the resolution\r\n     and platform committee than before the convention itself.\r\n\r\n     To what an appalling degree women were discriminated against by\r\n     the law prior to 1860, may be inferred from subsequent\r\n     legislative enactments. At almost every sitting of the biennial\r\n     legislature, since 1860, some important change will be observed.\r\n     In 1861 was passed the following:\r\n\r\n          AN ACT _to enlarge the Legal Capacity of Married Women whose\r\n          Husbands are Insane, and to enable them to Contract as if\r\n          they were Unmarried._\r\n\r\n          SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the\r\n          State of Indiana: That all married women, or those who may\r\n          hereafter be married, whose husbands are or may be insane,\r\n          are, during the continuance of such insanity, hereby enabled\r\n          and authorized to make and to execute all such contracts,\r\n          and to be contracted with in relation to their separate\r\n          property, as they could if they were unmarried, and they may\r\n          sue and be sued as if they were _sole_.\r\n\r\n     The legislature of 1863 was undisturbed by any question\r\n     concerning women. In 1865 the legislature discriminated against\r\n     women by the passage of a very long act, prescribing the manner\r\n     in which enumerations of _white male citizens_ shall be made;\r\n     thus implying that a _white male citizen_ is an honorable and\r\n     important person, whose existence is to be noted with due care;\r\n     with a care that distinguishes him equally above the _white\r\n     female_ and the _black male_ citizen, and in effect places these\r\n     two unenumerated divisions of human beings into one class.\r\n\r\n     Another act of 1865 reaeffirmed an act of 1852 which prescribed\r\n     the classes of persons capable of making a will, from which\r\n     married women were excluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: May Wright Sewall]\r\n\r\n\r\n     The legislature of 1867 passed an act in regard to conveyance of\r\n     lands by wives of persons of unsound mind, which read as follows:\r\n\r\n          SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Indiana:\r\n          That in cases where the guardian of any person of unsound\r\n          mind, under the direction of any court of competent\r\n          jurisdiction has made, or may hereafter make, sale of any\r\n          lands of such person of unsound mind, the wife of such\r\n          person of unsound mind may by her separate deed release and\r\n          convey all her interest in and title to such land, and her\r\n          deed so made shall thereafter debar her from all claim to\r\n          such land, and shall have the same effect on her rights as\r\n          if her husband had been of sound mind and she had joined\r\n          with such husband in the execution of such conveyance.\r\n\r\n     In 1869, an act passed by the legislature of 1852, providing for\r\n     the settlement of a decedent's estate, was so amended as to\r\n     provide that the widow might select articles to the value of\r\n     $500, or receive the first $500 derived from the sale, or in case\r\n     it was worth no more than $500, might hold it. In 1871 the\r\n     amendment of 1869 was further amended so that in case the\r\n     personal property was less than $500 the deficit could be a lien\r\n     on the real estate, to be settled with other judgments and\r\n     mortgages.\r\n\r\n     In 1873 the possible ability of women to serve the State\r\n     officially was recognized by the passage of the following bill:\r\n\r\n          SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Indiana:\r\n          That women are hereby declared to be eligible to any office,\r\n          the election to which is or shall be vested in the General\r\n          Assembly of this State; or the appointment to which is or\r\n          shall be vested in the governor thereof.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 2. The foregoing shall not include women who shall\r\n          labor under any disability which may prevent them from\r\n          binding themselves by an official bond.\r\n\r\n     The legislature of 1873 also passed an act regulating the liquor\r\n     traffic, in which it is formally provided that a wife shall have\r\n     the same right to sue, to control the suit, and to control the\r\n     sum recovered by the suit, as a _feme sole_.\r\n\r\n     In 1875 an act passed the General Assembly making it impossible\r\n     to sell real property in which a woman has, by virtue of her\r\n     marriage; an inchoate right, for less than four-ninths of its\r\n     appraised value: and also providing that upon the sale of any\r\n     piece or aggregate of pieces of real property not exceeding\r\n     $2,000, the wife has her absolute right; and moreover providing\r\n     that in case of a judicial sale, the wife's inchoate interests\r\n     become absolute, and she may demand a partition.\r\n\r\n     In 1877 the General Assembly passed an act enabling married women\r\n     whose husbands are insane to sell and to convey real-estate\r\n     belonging to such married women, in the same way as if _femes\r\n     soles_.\r\n\r\n     When the act for establishing a female prison passed the\r\n     legislature of 1860, it provided that the board managing its\r\n     affairs should consist of three men, who should be assisted by an\r\n     advisory board composed of one man and two women. By the\r\n     legislature of 1877 this section was so amended as to make the\r\n     managing board consist of women exclusively, and the advisory\r\n     board was abolished.[341]\r\n\r\n     Of all the changes effected in the statutory law of Indiana since\r\n     1860, the following is the most important and may be regarded, so\r\n     far as women are concerned, the measure of the highest\r\n     legislative justice thus far attained in any State. This bill was\r\n     prepared by Addison C. Harris, then representing Indianapolis in\r\n     the State Senate, and was approved March 25, 1879:\r\n\r\n          AN ACT _concerning Married Women--Approved March 25, 1879:_\r\n\r\n          SEC. 1.--Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State\r\n          of Indiana: A married woman may bargain, sell, assign and\r\n          transfer her separate personal property the same as if she\r\n          were _sole_.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 2.--A married woman may carry on any trade or business,\r\n          and perform any labor or service on her sole and separate\r\n          account. The earnings and profits of any married woman\r\n          accruing from her trade, business, services or labor, other\r\n          than labor for her husband or family, shall be her sole and\r\n          separate property.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 3.--A married woman may enter into any contract in\r\n          reference to her personal estate, trade, business, labor or\r\n          service, and the management and improvement of her separate\r\n          real property, the same as if she were _sole_; and her\r\n          separate estate, real and personal, shall be liable therefor\r\n          on execution or other judicial process.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 4.--No conveyance or contract made by a married woman\r\n          for the sale of her lands or any interest therein, other\r\n          than leases for a term not exceeding three years, and\r\n          mortgages on lands to secure the purchase money of such\r\n          lands, shall be valid, unless her husband shall join\r\n          therein. Provided, however, that if she shall have attempted\r\n          to convey her real estate or shall have agreed to convey the\r\n          same, and shall have received the whole or any part of the\r\n          consideration therefor, the person paying such\r\n          consideration, or the person for whose benefit the same was\r\n          paid, shall have the right to sue and recover judgment\r\n          therefor, and the same may be enforced against the property\r\n          of such married woman.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 5.--A married woman shall be bound by the covenants of\r\n          the title in a deed of conveyance of her real property.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 6.--A married woman may bring and maintain an action in\r\n          her own name against any person or body corporate for\r\n          damages for any injury to her person or character, the same\r\n          as if she were _sole_; and the money recovered shall be her\r\n          separate property, and her husband in such case shall not be\r\n          liable for costs.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 7.--Whenever the husband causes repairs or improvements\r\n          to be made on the real property of the wife, with her\r\n          knowledge and consent thereto in writing, delivered to the\r\n          contractor or person performing the labor or furnishing the\r\n          material, she shall alone be liable for material furnished\r\n          or labor done.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 8.--A husband shall not be liable for any debts\r\n          contracted by the wife in carrying on any trade, labor or\r\n          business on her sole and separate account, nor for\r\n          improvements made by her authority on her separate real\r\n          property.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 9.--Whenever a judgment is recovered against a married\r\n          woman, her separate property may be sold on execution to\r\n          satisfy the same, as in other cases. Provided, however, that\r\n          her wearing apparel and articles of personal adornment\r\n          purchased by her, not exceeding two hundred dollars in\r\n          value, and all such jewelry, ornaments, books, works of art\r\n          and _virtu_, and other such effects for personal or\r\n          household use as may have been given to her as presents,\r\n          gifts and keep-sakes, shall not be subject to execution. And\r\n          provided further, that she shall hold as exempt, except for\r\n          the purchase money therefor, other property to the amount of\r\n          three hundred dollars to be set apart and appraised in the\r\n          manner provided by law for exemption of property.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 10.--A married woman shall not mortgage or in any\r\n          manner encumber her separate property acquired by descent,\r\n          devise or gift, as a security for the debt or liability of\r\n          her husband or any other person.\r\n\r\n     The legislature of 1881 enacted the following, which is really a\r\n     sequence of the property-rights statute of 1879:\r\n\r\n          A married woman may sue alone when: _First_--The action\r\n          concerns her own property. _Second_--When the action is\r\n          between herself and her husband. But in no case shall she\r\n          be required to sue or defend by guardian or next friend,\r\n          unless she be under twenty-one years.\r\n\r\n          It further enacted, making it section 28, to act 38, that:\r\n          When a husband or father has deserted his family, or is\r\n          imprisoned, the wife or mother may prosecute or defend in\r\n          his name any action which he might have prosecuted or\r\n          defended, and shall have the same powers and rights therein\r\n          as he might have had.\r\n\r\n     The legislature of 1881 also passed the following:\r\n\r\n          AN ACT _to Authorize the Election of Women to School\r\n          Offices_:\r\n\r\n          SEC. 1.--Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Indiana,\r\n          that any woman, married or single, of the age of twenty-one\r\n          years and upwards, and possessing the qualifications\r\n          prescribed for men, shall be eligible to any office under\r\n          the general or special school laws of the State.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 2.--That any woman elected or appointed to any office\r\n          under the provisions of this act, before she enters upon the\r\n          discharge of the duties of her office, shall qualify and\r\n          give bond as required by law; and such bond shall be binding\r\n          upon her and her securities.\r\n\r\n     The following, enacted by this same legislature of 1881, would\r\n     indicate that fidelity to his domestic obligations is not even\r\n     yet esteemed in man as a virtue of high order; the value attached\r\n     to the fidelity can be measured by the penalty incurred by\r\n     infidelity, which is thus stated:\r\n\r\n          Whoever without cause deserts his wife or children, and\r\n          leaves wife and child or children as a charge upon any\r\n          county of this State, shall be fined not more than $100 nor\r\n          less than $10.\r\n\r\n     As has been indicated in another connection, it was the\r\n     legislature of 1881 which distinguished itself by passing a bill\r\n     for amending section 2 of article II. of the State constitution\r\n     so as to give women the right to vote in all elections. The\r\n     legislature of 1883 did nothing to further ameliorate the legal\r\n     condition of women; and the highest legal rights enjoyed by women\r\n     of Indiana are indicated in the foregoing recital of legislative\r\n     action upon the subject from 1860 to 1884 inclusive.\r\n\r\n     For some years after public schools were established in Indiana,\r\n     women had no recognition. I am told by a reliable gentleman, Dr.\r\n     R. T. Brown, who served from 1833 to 1840 as examiner in one of\r\n     the most advanced counties of the commonwealth, that during that\r\n     period no woman ever applied to him for a license to teach, and\r\n     that up to 1850 very few were employed in the public schools. At\r\n     that time it was permitted women to teach \"subscription\" schools\r\n     during the vacations, for which purpose the use of the district\r\n     school-house was frequently granted. It was by demonstrating\r\n     their capacity in this unobtrusive use of holidays, that women\r\n     obtained employment in the regular schools. The tables show that\r\n     in 1861 there were 6,421 men and 1,905 women employed in the\r\n     primary schools, and 128 men and 72 women in the high schools.\r\n     From that time up to 1866, owing to the war, the number of men\r\n     decreased while that of women rapidly increased. The tables for\r\n     that year show 5,330 men and 4,163 women in the schools. The\r\n     number of men employed in 1880 was 7,802, of women, 5,776. While\r\n     the very best places are held by men, the majority of the\r\n     second-rate places are filled by women, and men fill a majority\r\n     of the lowest places. The average daily wages received by men\r\n     engaged in the public schools in 1880 was $1.86, while the\r\n     average daily wages of women was $1.76.\r\n\r\n     Of the twenty-six academies, colleges and universities, all are,\r\n     with two notable exceptions--Hanover and Wabash--open to women.\r\n     Of these, Butler, at Irvington, formerly known as the\r\n     Northwestern Christian University, was the first to admit women\r\n     to a \"female course,\" which its managers arranged to meet the\r\n     needs of the female mind. In its laudable endeavor to adapt its\r\n     requirements to this intermediate class of beings, the university\r\n     substituted music for mathematics, and French for Greek. Few,\r\n     however, availed themselves of this course, and it was utterly\r\n     rejected by Demia Butler, a daughter of the founder of the\r\n     institution, who entered it in 1860, and graduated from what was\r\n     then known as the male course, in 1864, thus winning the right to\r\n     be remembered as the first woman in Indiana to demonstrate the\r\n     capacity of her sex to cope with the classics and higher\r\n     mathematics. From that time the \"female course\" became gradually\r\n     less popular, until it was discarded. One after another, private\r\n     and denominational schools have fallen into line, until nearly\r\n     all of them are open to women without humiliating conditions.\r\n\r\n     Up to 1867 the Indiana University exhibited the anomaly of a\r\n     great institution of learning supported by the State, and\r\n     regarding itself as the crown of the public-school system, free\r\n     to but one-half of the children of the commonwealth. Since that\r\n     date it has been open equally to both sexes in all three of its\r\n     departments--the State Normal School, located at Terre Haute, the\r\n     Agricultural College, located at Lafayette and commonly known as\r\n     Purdue University, and the State University proper, including\r\n     literary and scientific departments located at Bloomington. Of\r\n     this last branch, 30 per cent. are women. That there is no longer\r\n     any discrimination in these higher institutions of learning is\r\n     not true. Girls must always feel that they are regarded as\r\n     belonging to a subordinate class, wherever women are not found in\r\n     the faculty and board of managers. The depressing influence of\r\n     their absence in superior positions cannot be measured.\r\n\r\n     Very few women are found in college faculties in Indiana, and\r\n     none on boards of trustees. Those most conspicuous in ability are\r\n     Mrs. Sarah A. Oren,[342] who, having served two successive terms\r\n     as State librarian, was called from that position to fill a chair\r\n     at Purdue University, where she remained several years; Miss\r\n     Catharine Merrill, professor of English literature in Butler\r\n     University, who throughout her term of service from 1869 to 1883\r\n     enjoyed the deserved reputation of being one of the strongest\r\n     members of the faculty;[343] and Miss Rebecca I. Thompson, who is\r\n     professor of mathematics at Franklin College, the leading Baptist\r\n     school in the State. The women occupying these conspicuous\r\n     positions are all identified with the suffrage movement;\r\n     Professor Thompson, of Franklin, is the president of the Johnson\r\n     County Suffrage Association. Miss N. Cropsey has served the cause\r\n     of public education in Indianapolis in some capacity for twenty\r\n     years, and has for several years been superintendent of the\r\n     primary schools, a place which she fills with acknowledged\r\n     ability. Miss Cropsey is another living denial of the common\r\n     assertion, that only half-cultured and ill-paid women want the\r\n     ballot.\r\n\r\n     Of the four medical colleges in Indianapolis, two admit women and\r\n     two exclude them. No theological school in the State receives\r\n     women, nor does the only law school, which is located at\r\n     Indianapolis; but its former president, Hon. James B. Black, told\r\n     me that it was ready to receive them upon application.\r\n\r\n     Formerly, many questions now decided by the board of trustees of\r\n     each school district, were directly settled by the people\r\n     themselves at the annual school meeting. For instance, the\r\n     teacher for the coming term was elected from among the candidates\r\n     for that place; the salary to be paid, the length of term, the\r\n     location of the school-house, were all questions to be decided by\r\n     ballot. I have reliable authority for the assertion that in some\r\n     parts of the State, as early as 1860, widows, and wives whose\r\n     husbands were necessarily absent from the school meetings, voted\r\n     upon these questions. During the years of the war this practice\r\n     became very common, but fell into disuse upon the return of\r\n     peace.\r\n\r\n     There are many physicians in Indiana enjoying the merited esteem\r\n     of their respective communities and having a lucrative practice.\r\n     The most notable example of success in this profession is Dr.\r\n     Mary F. Thomas of Richmond.[344] Another living testimony to\r\n     woman's right in the medical profession is Dr. Rachel Swain of\r\n     Indianapolis, whose patrons are among the first families of the\r\n     city. By zealous devotion to her profession she has secured the\r\n     respect and social recognition of the community in which she\r\n     moves. As an avowed friend of suffrage, whose word in season is\r\n     never lacking, Dr. Swain carries a knowledge of our principles\r\n     into circles where it would otherwise slowly penetrate. Dr. Mary\r\n     Wilhite of Crawfordsville ranks with the best physicians of that\r\n     city. In her practice she has gained a competence for herself and\r\n     disseminated among her patients a knowledge of hygienic laws that\r\n     has improved the health and the morals of the community to which\r\n     she has ministered. She, too, advocates political equality for\r\n     woman. Dr. Sarah Stockton of Lafayette settled in Indianapolis in\r\n     the autumn of 1883, and was soon, on the petition of leading\r\n     citizens, including both men and women, appointed as physician to\r\n     the Woman's Department of the Hospital for the Insane. Her\r\n     professional labors at the hospital and in general practice\r\n     indicate both learning and skill. In November, Dr. Marie Haslep\r\n     was elected attendant physician at the Woman's Reformatory, a\r\n     State institution having some four hundred inmates, where her\r\n     services have been characterized by faithfulness and caution.\r\n\r\n     Elizabeth Eaglesfield, a graduate of the law department of\r\n     Michigan University, was admitted to the bar of Marion county in\r\n     the spring of 1885, and is the first woman to open an independent\r\n     law-office in this State.\r\n\r\n     Very few women have served in the ministry. The only one who ever\r\n     secured any prominence in this profession was Miss Prudence\r\n     LeClerc, who was pastor of the Universalist church in Madison in\r\n     1870-71, and served parishes at different points in\r\n     south-eastern Indiana until her death in 1878. Miss LeClerc\r\n     frequently spoke at suffrage conventions, and called meetings\r\n     wherever she preached, instructing the people in the philosophy\r\n     of this reform.\r\n\r\n     To obtain accurate statistics as to the professions and\r\n     industries is extremely difficult, as the year 1881 was the first\r\n     in which the State considered women at all. That year the head of\r\n     the bureau of statistics sent to each town and county\r\n     commissioner certain sets of questions relative to women's\r\n     occupations. The grace with which they were received, the\r\n     seriousness with which they were considered, the consequent\r\n     accuracy with which they were answered, may be inferred from the\r\n     fact that one trustee replied, \"The women in our county are\r\n     mostly engaged in baby-tending,\" and that his response was\r\n     generally copied by the press as a manifestation of brilliant\r\n     wit. Although some commissioners felt their time too valuable to\r\n     spend in gathering information relative to the work of women,\r\n     from the reports of those who seriously undertook to canvass this\r\n     matter, a table has been arranged and published, which, though\r\n     incomplete, must be regarded, both in variety of occupations and\r\n     in the numbers of women registered, as a most favorable showing\r\n     for this Western State. The total number of women engaged outside\r\n     of home, in non-domestic and money-making industries, is 15,122;\r\n     the number of industries represented by them is 51. Add to these\r\n     the number of teachers, and we have over 20,000 women in the\r\n     trades and professions denied the ballot, that sole weapon\r\n     pledged by a republic to every citizen for the protection of\r\n     person and property.\r\n\r\n     Of the men and women prominent in this movement since 1860, whose\r\n     names are not mentioned in the first volume, the one meriting the\r\n     first place is beyond doubt Dr. R. T. Brown of Indianapolis. He\r\n     has the longest record as an advocate of suffrage to be found in\r\n     the State. As a speaker in the first Harrison campaign (1836) he\r\n     advocated suffrage without regard to sex. Engaged as a teacher or\r\n     inspector in the public schools in the early years, Dr. Brown\r\n     argued the adaptation of women to the teacher's profession, and\r\n     insisted that salaries should be independent of sex; and in many\r\n     individual cases where he had authority, women secured this\r\n     recognition before it was generally admitted even in theory to be\r\n     just.\r\n\r\n     When, in 1855, the Northwestern Christian (now Butler) University\r\n     was founded, Dr. Brown, as one of the trustees, advocated\r\n     coeducation; in 1858 he took the chair of natural science, and in\r\n     that branch taught classes of both sexes until 1871. In 1868 he\r\n     was active in organizing the Indiana Medical College on the basis\r\n     of equal rights to women, and filled the chair of chemistry until\r\n     1872; in 1873 he was appointed to the chair of physiology, which\r\n     he held until 1877, and then resigned because the board of\r\n     trustees determined to exclude women. This proves that Dr.\r\n     Brown's devotion to the doctrine of equal rights is of that rare\r\n     degree which will bear the crucial test of official and pecuniary\r\n     sacrifice. He has been an active member of the State and city\r\n     suffrage associations from the beginning.\r\n\r\n     The name of Mary E. Haggart first appears as a member of the\r\n     State Association at the convention held in Indianapolis in 1869.\r\n     In 1870, Mr. Hadley made a speech in the State Senate against\r\n     woman suffrage, to which Mrs. Haggart wrote an able reply which\r\n     was published and widely commented on by the press of the State.\r\n     Her next notable effort was in a discussion through several\r\n     numbers of the _Ladies' Own Magazine_, published by Mrs. Cora\r\n     Bland, where she completely refuted the objections urged by her\r\n     opponent, a literary gentleman of some note. Mrs. Haggart has\r\n     addressed the legislatures of her own State, of Massachusetts,\r\n     Rhode Island and Kentucky, as well as the Judiciary Committee of\r\n     the House of Representatives at the hearing granted the National\r\n     Association. She seldom speaks without the most careful\r\n     preparation, and never without manifesting abilities of the\r\n     highest order. Perhaps no woman in the State, as a speaker, has\r\n     won higher encomiums from the press or has better deserved them.\r\n\r\n     The first active step taken in suffrage by Mrs. Florence M.\r\n     Adkinson (then Miss Burlingame) was to call a convention in\r\n     Lawrenceburg. In 1871, 1872, she gave several lectures on\r\n     suffrage and temperance in Ohio, and held a series of meetings in\r\n     southeastern Indiana. Though an acceptable speaker, it is as a\r\n     writer that Mrs. Adkinson is best known; she is an officer in\r\n     both the State and the city organizations, and in every capacity\r\n     serves the cause with rare fidelity.\r\n\r\n     The name of Lizzie Boynton of Crawfordsville frequently occurs in\r\n     suffrage reports between 1865 and 1870. She was a member of the\r\n     State Association and a frequent speaker at its conventions.\r\n     Besides working in that body, she assisted in the organization of\r\n     the local society at Crawfordsville, wrote poems, stories,\r\n     essays, and won high rank in the State in literature and reform.\r\n     From mature womanhood her record as Mrs. Harbert belongs to\r\n     Illinois rather than Indiana.\r\n\r\n     The first time I met Mrs. Zerelda G. Wallace she was circulating\r\n     a temperance petition to present to the legislature. One day\r\n     while busy on the third floor of the high-school building a\r\n     fellow-teacher sent up word that a lady wished to see me.\r\n     Descending, I was introduced to Mrs. Wallace, who, in a bland\r\n     way, requested me to sign the paper which she extended. Never\r\n     doubting that I might do so, I had taken my pen when my eye\r\n     caught the words: \"While we do not clamor for any additional\r\n     civil or political rights.\" \"But I do clamor,\" I exclaimed, and\r\n     threw down the paper and pen and went back to my work, vexed in\r\n     soul that I should have been dragged down three flights of stairs\r\n     to see one more proof of the degree to which honorable women love\r\n     to humiliate themselves before men for sweet favor's sake. Mrs.\r\n     Wallace went forward with her work of solicitation, thinking me,\r\n     no doubt, to be a very impetuous, if not impertinent, young\r\n     woman.\r\n\r\n     When, however, upon the presentation of her petition, whose\r\n     framers had taken such care to disclaim any desire \"for\r\n     additional civil and political rights,\" Mrs. Wallace was startled\r\n     by Dr. Thompson's avowal (having known the doctor, as she naively\r\n     says, \"as a Christian gentleman\"), that he was not there \"to\r\n     represent his conscience, but to obey his constituents,\" in her\r\n     aroused soul there was that instant born the determination to\r\n     become a \"constituent.\" As soon as the hearing was at an end,\r\n     Mrs. Wallace confessed this determination to Dr. Thompson,\r\n     thanking him for unintentionally awakening her to a sense of\r\n     woman's proper position in the republic. This change in Mrs.\r\n     Wallace's attitude was not generally known until the following\r\n     May, when the annual State Temperance convention was held in\r\n     Indianapolis; then, in her address before that body, she avowed\r\n     her conviction that it was woman's duty to seek the ballot as a\r\n     means of exerting her will upon legislation. From that time Mrs.\r\n     Wallace has neglected no opportunity to propagate suffrage\r\n     doctrines, and has been most potent in influencing her temperance\r\n     coaedjutors to embrace these principles. Earnestness and logic are\r\n     Mrs. Wallace's abiding forces. Her literary work is chiefly\r\n     confined to correspondence, in which she is so faithful that it\r\n     is doubtful if any man in public life in Indiana can plead\r\n     ignorance of the arguments in favor of suffrage. Mrs. Wallace has\r\n     been an officer in the National, the American and the State\r\n     suffrage societies, and has served the Equal Suffrage Society of\r\n     Indianapolis as president most of the time since its formation.\r\n     Having lived in this city more than half a century, related to\r\n     many men who have held high official positions, she has had an\r\n     opportunity to exert a wide influence, and it may be safe to say\r\n     that, by virtue of her own consecrated life, she exerts more\r\n     moral power in this community than any other woman in Indiana.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Helen M. Gougar has addressed the legislatures of New York,\r\n     Kansas and Wisconsin, besides that of her own State. As an\r\n     extempore speaker she has no peer among her co-workers; her first\r\n     suffrage speech was made at Delphi, May, 1877. In July, 1881,\r\n     Mrs. Gougar became the editor of _Our Herald_, a weekly which she\r\n     conducted with great ability and success in the interest of the\r\n     two constitutional amendments then pending. In 1884, in an\r\n     extensive lecturing tour, she addressed large audiences in\r\n     Washington, Philadelphia, New York and Albany. In the year 1883,\r\n     Mrs. Josephine R. Nichols of Illinois, and Mrs. L. May Wheeler of\r\n     Massachusetts, came to reside in Indianapolis. Both these ladies\r\n     have lectured frequently and with marked effect in various parts\r\n     of the State.\r\n\r\n     I cannot close without a mention of those public men who have\r\n     honored this State by their adherence to the principle of woman\r\n     suffrage and thereby earned a title to the fame which will belong\r\n     to the advocates of this cause in the hour of its triumph. Among\r\n     these Hon. George W. Julian is most conspicuous. Referring to his\r\n     services in congress, Mr. Julian once wrote:\r\n\r\n          My opinions about woman suffrage, however, date much further\r\n          back. The subject was first brought to my attention in a\r\n          brief chapter on the \"Political Non-existence of Women,\" in\r\n          Miss Martineau's book on \"Society in America,\" which I read\r\n          in 1847. She there pithily stated the substance of all that\r\n          has since been said respecting the logic of woman's right to\r\n          the ballot; and finding myself unable to answer, I accepted\r\n          it. On recently referring to this chapter I find myself more\r\n          impressed by its force than when I first read it. * * * My\r\n          interest in anti-slavery was awakened about the same time,\r\n          and I regarded it as the _previous_ question, and as less\r\n          abstract and far more important and absorbing than that of\r\n          suffrage for women. For the sake of the negro I accepted\r\n          Mr. Lincoln's philosophy of \"one war at a time,\" though\r\n          always ready to own and defend my position as to woman's\r\n          right to the ballot.\r\n\r\n     The sincerity of Mr. Julian's belief in woman suffrage is proved\r\n     by his repeated efforts to further the cause in the United States\r\n     congress. On December 8, 1868, he submitted an amendment to the\r\n     constitution, guaranteeing suffrage to all United States\r\n     citizens, which, as the negro had not then been enfranchised, he\r\n     numbered article fifteen. On March 15, 1869, he submitted the\r\n     same amendment, with the exception that the words \"race\" and\r\n     \"color\" were omitted; on the same day Mr. Julian offered a bill\r\n     providing for the immediate enfranchisement of women in all the\r\n     territories of the United States, thus doubling on one day his\r\n     claim to the gratitude of American women. On April 4, 1870, he\r\n     offered another amendment, numbered article sixteen, which\r\n     followed the exact form and phraseology of the fifteenth. On\r\n     January 20, 1871, he offered an amendment to the bill, providing\r\n     a government for the District of Columbia, striking out the word\r\n     \"male\" in the section defining the right of suffrage. It is\r\n     interesting to note that even so long ago that amendment received\r\n     55 yeas against 117 nays.[345] The bills which Mr. Julian thus\r\n     submitted to congress when he was a member of that body prove his\r\n     constancy to a cause early espoused, his conversion to which was\r\n     due to that remarkable English woman whose claims to the\r\n     gratitude of her American sisters are thus enhanced. Mr. Julian\r\n     has not worked much with the suffrage societies of his own State,\r\n     but he has never failed in his repeated canvasses to utter the\r\n     seasonable word. His conviction that it is the duty of the\r\n     national government to take the initiative in defining the\r\n     political rights of its citizens has naturally led him to present\r\n     this question to the nation as represented in its congress,\r\n     rather than to agitate it in the State.\r\n\r\n     Oliver P. Morton and Joseph E. McDonald are two other names\r\n     conspicuous in Indiana history which occur frequently in\r\n     connection with \"aye\" in the records which have preserved the\r\n     action of every member of congress on the various amendments\r\n     brought before it involving woman's political equality.\r\n\r\n     Albert G. Porter, ex-governor of Indiana, has on more than one\r\n     public occasion avowed his belief in woman's equality as a\r\n     citizen, and has assented to the proposition that under a\r\n     republic the only sign of such equality is the ballot. Ardent\r\n     advocates have often thought him inexcusably reticent in\r\n     expressing his convictions upon this subject, but such have\r\n     learned that it is given to but few mortals to \"remember those in\r\n     bonds as bound with them,\" and no other governor of Indiana has\r\n     ever taken occasion to remind the General Assembly of its duties\r\n     to women, as Governor Porter habitually did. In his address of\r\n     1881 he called the attention of the legislature to the improved\r\n     condition of women under the laws, pointed out disabilities still\r\n     continuing, and bespoke the respectful attention of the General\r\n     Assembly to the women who proposed to come before it with their\r\n     claims. In his biennial message, 1883, the governor recommended\r\n     the enactment of a statute which should require that at least\r\n     one of the physicians appointed to attend in the department for\r\n     women in the hospital for the insane should be a woman. The whole\r\n     tone of Governor Porter's administration was liberal toward\r\n     women; he invariably implied his belief in their equality, and on\r\n     one or two occasions has evinced his respect for their ability by\r\n     conferring on them responsible offices. Many of the leading men\r\n     in the Republican party, and a few in the Democratic, are\r\n     favorable, and while they do not labor for the enfranchisement of\r\n     their sisters with the same enthusiasm which personal bondage\r\n     excites, their constant influence is on the side of woman's\r\n     emancipation.\r\n\r\n     As to the charities conducted by Indiana women, for a condensed\r\n     narrative of the efficient service of Mrs. L. B. Wishard and Miss\r\n     Susan Fussell, I must refer readers to the account kindly\r\n     prepared for me by Mrs. Paulina T. Merritt.[346]\r\n\r\n     Whether or not justified by the facts, the feeling is current\r\n     that those whom the masses favor hold themselves aloof from those\r\n     whom personal experience, or a sense of justice, compels to walk\r\n     the stony path of reform. The _litterateurs_ often form a sort of\r\n     pseudo-intellectual aristocracy, and do not willingly affiliate\r\n     with reformers, whom they are ready to assume to be less\r\n     cultivated than themselves. Of this weakness our literary women\r\n     have not been guilty. Most of them are members of the suffrage\r\n     society.[347]\r\n\r\n     A system is now developing which will not only stimulate women to\r\n     engage in competitive industries and secure justice in rewarding\r\n     such labor, but will greatly facilitate the work of ascertaining\r\n     what part women do take in the general industries of the State.\r\n     Indiana, being mainly agricultural, is divided into sixteen\r\n     districts, each of which has organized an agricultural society.\r\n     Besides these there are also county societies. These\r\n     organizations are composed of men and women, the latter having\r\n     nominally the same powers and privileges as the former. Annually\r\n     the State Agricultural Association holds a meeting at\r\n     Indianapolis. This is a delegate body, consisting of\r\n     representatives from the district and county societies. There is\r\n     no constitutional check against sending women as delegates,\r\n     though it has not hitherto been done. One chief duty of the\r\n     primary convention is to elect a State board of agriculture. This\r\n     board consists of sixteen members, one for each agricultural\r\n     district. The managers of the Woman's State Fair Association have\r\n     called an industrial convention, whose sessions will be held at\r\n     the same time that the Agricultural Association holds its annual\r\n     meeting.[348]\r\n\r\n     If the press reflects the public, it also moulds it; and its\r\n     conservative attitude is doubtless to a very considerable degree\r\n     responsible for the tone of opinion which prevailed here up to\r\n     recent years. Papers throughout the State naturally take their\r\n     cue from the party organs published at the capital, while the few\r\n     papers identified with no party are wont to adapt themselves even\r\n     more carefully to popular opinion upon general subjects.\r\n\r\n     The citations made in the earlier part of this chapter from the\r\n     _Sentinel_ and the _Journal_ clearly show the spirit of their\r\n     management in 1869. But it must not be inferred that the\r\n     _Journal_ has through all these years maintained the position\r\n     occupied by it at that time. Had it done so, one may reasonably\r\n     believe that the women of Indiana would before to-day have been\r\n     enfranchised. On the contrary, that sheet has been very\r\n     vacillating, speaking for or against the cause according to the\r\n     principles of its managers, the paper having frequently changed\r\n     hands; and until recently the principles of the same managers\r\n     upon this question have been shifting; but for the last five or\r\n     six years the _Journal_ has been a consistent, though somewhat\r\n     mild, supporter of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n     On the contrary, the _Sentinel_ had been constant in its\r\n     opposition, until, about eight years since, Mr. Shoemaker\r\n     becoming the manager, it announced a Sunday issue devoted to the\r\n     interests of women. The pledge then made has been nobly kept, and\r\n     although for a few months the _Sentinel_ seemed to edit its\r\n     week-day issues with a view to counteracting the possible good\r\n     effect of its Sunday utterances, the better spirit gradually\r\n     triumphed, until at last, so far as the woman question is\r\n     concerned, the paper is from Sunday to Saturday in harmony with\r\n     itself. For some time it gave one column in each Sunday issue to\r\n     the control of the State Central Suffrage Committee, and printed\r\n     two hundred copies of the column for special distribution among\r\n     the country papers.\r\n\r\n     The _Saturday Herald_, established in 1873, under the editorial\r\n     management of George C. Harding, deserves mention. From the\r\n     outset, this paper was the advocate of woman's right to be paid\r\n     for work done according to its market value, and to protect\r\n     herself and her property by the ballot. Perhaps the best service\r\n     rendered to women by Mr. Harding, was that of securing in 1874\r\n     Gertrude Garrison as assistant editor of the _Herald_. Mrs.\r\n     Garrison is, beyond question, one of the ablest journalists\r\n     Indiana can boast, and the influence of her pen in modifying the\r\n     popular estimate of woman's capabilities has been incalculable.\r\n     From 1874 she did half the work, editorial articles, locals,\r\n     sketches, and all the varieties of writing required upon a weekly\r\n     paper, but at her own request her name was not announced as\r\n     associate editor until 1876. In this capacity she remained upon\r\n     the _Herald_ until January 1, 1880, when the paper passed from\r\n     Mr. Harding's into other hands. During her connection with the\r\n     _Herald_, if there was anything particularly strong in the paper,\r\n     her associate received the credit. The public will not permit\r\n     itself to believe a woman capable of humor, though I think Mrs.\r\n     Garrison did as much to sustain the paper's reputation for wit as\r\n     even Mr. Harding. A. H. Dooley succeeded Mr. Harding as editor of\r\n     the _Saturday Herald_, and it remained under his management a\r\n     sturdy advocate of woman's enfranchisement. The _Saturday\r\n     Review_ was established by Mr. Harding in October, 1880, with\r\n     Mrs. Garrison associate editor. Upon the death of Mr. Harding,\r\n     May 8, 1881, Mr. Charles Dennis became chief editor, Mrs.\r\n     Garrison[349] remaining on the staff as his assistant.\r\n\r\n     The _Times_ was founded in June, 1881. From the first it devoted\r\n     a column to notes on women's work. From September of that year\r\n     there appeared in each Saturday issue a department devoted to the\r\n     interests of women, particularly to woman suffrage, under the\r\n     editorial management of May Wright Sewall. This department\r\n     reaeppeared in the weekly and was thus widely circulated among\r\n     country readers. The _Times_ is under the management of Colonel\r\n     W. R. Holloway. Although from the first fair in its discussions\r\n     of all reform questions, it did not avow itself to be an advocate\r\n     of woman suffrage until the week after the public entertainment\r\n     of the Equal Suffrage Society, 1881, when there appeared an\r\n     editorial nearly one column in length, setting forth its views\r\n     upon the whole subject. This editorial contained the following\r\n     paragraph:\r\n\r\n          As the question is likely to become a prominent theme of\r\n          discussion during the next few years, the _Times_ will now\r\n          say that it is decidedly and unequivocally in favor of woman\r\n          suffrage. We believe that women have the same right to vote\r\n          that men have, that it is impolitic and unjust to deprive\r\n          them of the right, and that its free and full bestowal would\r\n          conserve the welfare of society and the good of government.\r\n\r\n     In the daily _Evening News_, Mr. J. H. Holliday, with his\r\n     editorial aids, has set himself to stem the tide of progress\r\n     which he evidently thinks will, unless a manful endeavor on his\r\n     part shall prevent it, bear all things down to ruin. The\r\n     character of his efforts may be inferred from the following\r\n     extracts which appeared in January and December of 1881:\r\n\r\n          We wish our legislators would go home and ponder this thing.\r\n          Read the Bible and understand the scheme of creation. Read\r\n          the New Testament, and appreciate the creation of the\r\n          Christian home, and the headship of things. Reflect upon\r\n          what rests the future of this government we have reared, and\r\n          ask what would become of it if the Christian homes in which\r\n          it is founded were broken up; then reflect upon what would\r\n          become of the Christian homes if men and women were to\r\n          attend to the same duties in life. To get a realistic\r\n          notion, let every man who has a wife ask himself how he\r\n          would relish being told by her, \"I have an engagement with\r\n          John Smith to-night to see about fixing up a slate to get\r\n          Mrs. Jones nominated for sheriff,\" and being left to go his\r\n          own way while she goes with Smith. If that wouldn't make\r\n          hell in the household in one act we don't know what would,\r\n          yet this is merely one little trivial episode of what this\r\n          anti-christian woman suffrage scheme means.\r\n\r\n          To what straits must the advocates of suffrage for women be\r\n          driven when they needs must seek to show that the ballot is\r\n          not degrading. What becomes of all our fine talk of the\r\n          ballot as an educator if they who seek to secure it for\r\n          women must advocate as a reason why it should not be\r\n          withheld that it is not degrading! But what better can one\r\n          expect from those who, when it is suggested that there are\r\n          duties attaching to the ballot as well as rights, solemnly\r\n          say that the few moments necessary to deposit a ballot will\r\n          not interfere with women's duties of sweeping and dusting\r\n          and baby-tending. When one hears talk of this sort, there is\r\n          indeed a grave doubt as to whether the ballot really is an\r\n          educator after all.\r\n\r\n     The first of the above citations is from what might be called an\r\n     article of instruction addressed to the legislature then in\r\n     session, and considering the question of woman suffrage. The\r\n     occasion which inspired the second paragraph may be readily\r\n     inferred. It seems \"profitable for the instruction\" of the future\r\n     to preserve a few extracts like the above, that it may be seen\r\n     how weak and wild, strength itself becomes, when the ally of\r\n     prejudice and precedent.\r\n\r\n     The _Indiana Farmer_, exceptionally well edited, having a wide\r\n     circulation in the agricultural sections of the State, and\r\n     enjoying there a powerful influence, is an outspoken advocate of\r\n     equal suffrage. From statistics regarding papers published\r\n     outside of Indianapolis, it may be safe to say that two hundred\r\n     of them favor, with varying degrees of constancy, giving the\r\n     ballot to women. On the staff of nearly all the papers whose\r\n     status is above given, are women, who in their respective\r\n     departments faithfully serve the common cause. During the last\r\n     few years, efforts have been directed to the capture of the local\r\n     press, and many of the county papers now have a department edited\r\n     by women. In most instances this work is done gratuitously, and\r\n     their success in this new line, entering upon it as they have\r\n     without previous training, illustrates the versatility of woman's\r\n     powers. Mrs. M. E. Price of Kokomo, Mrs. Sarah P. Franklin of\r\n     Anderson, Mrs. Laura Sandafur of Franklin, and Mrs. Ida M. Harper\r\n     of Terre Haute, deserve especial mention for their admirable work\r\n     in the papers of their respective towns. Mrs. Laura C. Arnold is\r\n     the chief editor of the Columbus _Democrat_, and is the only\r\n     woman in the State having editorial charge of a political party\r\n     paper, _Our Herald_, under the able editorial management of Mrs.\r\n     Helen M. Gougar, was a weekly published at Lafayette. It was\r\n     devoted to securing the re-passage and adoption of the woman\r\n     suffrage and prohibition amendments. It was a strong, aggressive\r\n     sheet, and deserved its almost unparalleled success.[350]\r\n\r\nIn closing this able report for Indiana a few facts in regard to\r\nthe author may interest the general reader as well as the student\r\nof history.\r\n\r\nMrs. May Wright Sewall has been well known for many years in\r\nIndianapolis in the higher departments of education, and has\r\nrecently crowned her efforts as a teacher by establishing a model\r\nclassical school for girls, in which she is not only training their\r\nminds to vigorous thought, but taking the initiative steps to\r\nsecure for them an equally vigorous physical development. Her\r\npupils are required to wear a comfortable gymnastic costume, all\r\ntheir garments loosely resting on their shoulders; corsets, tight\r\nwaists and high-heeled boots forbidden, for deep thinking requires\r\ndeep breathing. The whole upper floor of her new building is a\r\nspacious gymnasium, where her pupils exercise every day under the\r\ninstruction of a skillful German; and on every Saturday morning\r\nthey take lessons from the best dancing master in the city. The\r\nresult is, she has no dull scholars complaining of headaches. All\r\nare alike happy in their studies and amusements.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sewall is a preeminently common-sense woman, believing that\r\nsound theories can be put into practice. Although her tastes are\r\ndecidedly literary and aesthetic, she is a radical reformer. Hence\r\nher services in the literary club and suffrage society are alike\r\ninvaluable. And as chairman of the executive committee of the\r\nNational Association, she is without her peer in planning and\r\nexecuting the work.\r\n\r\nAs her husband, Mr. Theodore L. Sewall, is also at the head of a\r\nclassical school, and equally successful in training boys, it may\r\nbe said that both institutions have the advantage of the united\r\nthought of man and woman. As educators, Mr. and Mrs. Sewall have\r\nreaped much practical wisdom from their mutual consultations and\r\nsuggestions, the results of which have been of incalculable benefit\r\nto their pupils.\r\n\r\nPeering into the homes of the young women in the suffrage movement,\r\none cannot but remark the deference and respect with which these\r\nintelligent, self-reliant wives are uniformly treated by their\r\nhusbands, and the unbounded confidence and affection they give in\r\nreturn. For happiness in domestic life, men and women must meet as\r\nequals. A position of inferiority and dependence for even the best\r\norganized women, will either wither all their powers and reduce\r\nthem to apathetic machines, going the round of life's duties with a\r\nkind of hopeless dissatisfaction, or it will rouse a bitter\r\nantagonism, an active resistance, an offensive self-assertion,\r\npoisoning the very sources of domestic happiness. The true ideal of\r\nfamily life can never be realized until woman is restored to her\r\nrightful throne. Tennyson, in his \"Princess,\" gives us the\r\nprophetic vision when he says:\r\n\r\n            \"Everywhere\r\n    Two heads in council, two beside the hearth,\r\n    Two in the tangled business of the world,\r\n    Two in the liberal offices of life,\r\n    Two plummets dropped for one, to sound the abyss\r\n    Of science, and the secrets of the mind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[325] See Vol. I., page 306.\r\n\r\n[326] The call for this convention was signed by Amanda M.

DeWitt Wallace of Lafayette, G. H. Thomas of Huntington, and S.\r\nP. Yancey, merit honorable mention.\r\n\r\n[339] Mrs. Sewall, Mrs. Merritt and Mrs. Mary E.

M.\r\nJordan are all literary women who sympathize with and aid this\r\nreform.\r\n\r\n[348] The woman's department has constantly grown in extent and\r\nvalue, until it has become one of the most important features of\r\nthe State fair, and this year, 1885, the managers have allowed to\r\nit twice the space hitherto occupied. It is worthy of note that\r\nsuffrage papers, tracts and books are always to be found among the\r\nexhibits.\r\n\r\n[349] Mrs. Garrison left Indianapolis for New York in May of 1882.\r\nSuccess followed her to the metropolis and she now has, 1885, the\r\nentire editorial management of the literary department of the\r\nAmerican Press Association, and her work goes into more than fifty\r\nof the best weekly papers in the country.\r\n\r\n[350] _Our Herald_ did royal service in the campaign of 1882; it\r\nsubsequently became a monthly and in addition to other admirable\r\nefforts, undertook to introduce leading western women to the larger\r\nworld by publishing a series of biographical sketches of the most\r\nprominent. In the winter of 1885 Mrs. Gougar sold _Our Herald_ to\r\nMrs. Harbert, who published it in Chicago as the _The New Era_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nILLINOIS.\r\n\r\n     Chicago a Great Commercial Center--First Woman Suffrage\r\n     Agitation, 1855--A.

Its chief city, Chicago, extending for miles round the\r\nsouthern shores of Lake Michigan, is the great commercial center of\r\nthe boundless West. We may get some idea of the magnitude of her\r\ncommerce from the fact that the receipts and shipment of flour,\r\ngrain and cattle from that port alone in 1872 were valued at\r\n$370,000,000.\r\n\r\nWhen the battles with the Indians were finally ended, the\r\npopulation of the State rapidly increased, and in 1880 the census\r\ngave 1,586,523 males and 1,491,348 females. In the school\r\nstatistics we find about the same proportionate number of women and\r\ngirls as teachers and scholars in the public schools and in all the\r\nhonest walks of life; while men and boys in the criminal ranks are\r\nout of all proportion. For example, in the state-prison at Joliet\r\nthere were, in 1873, 1,321 criminals; fifteen only were women. And\r\nyet the more virtuous, educated, self-governed part of the\r\npopulation, that shared equally the hardships of the early days,\r\nand by industry and self-sacrifice helped to build up that great\r\nState, is still denied the civil and political rights declared by\r\nthe constitution to belong to every citizen of the commonwealth.\r\nThe trials and triumphs of the women of Illinois are vividly\r\nportrayed in the following records sent us by Elizabeth Boynton\r\nHarbert, Ph. D.:\r\n\r\n     His biographer asserts that Bernini, the celebrated Florentine\r\n     artist, architect, painter and poet, once gave a public opera in\r\n     Rome, for which he painted the scenes, composed the music, wrote\r\n     the poem, carved the statues, invented the engines, and built the\r\n     theater. Because of his versatile talents the man Bernini has\r\n     passed into history. Of almost equal versatility were the women\r\n     of the equal-rights movement, since in many instances their names\r\n     appear and reaeppear in the records we have consulted as authors,\r\n     editors, journalists, lecturers, teachers, physicians, lawyers,\r\n     ordained ministers and home-makers; and in many localities a\r\n     woman, to be eligible for the lyceum, was expected to be\r\n     statesmanlike as Elizabeth Cady Stanton, executive as Susan B.\r\n     Anthony, spiritual as Lucretia Mott, eloquent as Anna Dickinson,\r\n     graceful as Celia Burleigh, fascinating as Paulina Wright Davis;\r\n     a social queen, very domestic, a skillful musician, an excellent\r\n     cook, very young, and the mother of at least six children; even\r\n     then she was not entitled to the rights, privileges and\r\n     immunities of an American citizen. So \"the divine rights of the\r\n     people\" became the watchword of thoughtful men and women of the\r\n     Prairie State, and at the dawn of the second half of the present\r\n     century many caught the echoes of that historic convention at\r\n     Seneca Falls and insisted that the fundamental principles of our\r\n     government should be applied to all the citizens of the United\r\n     States.\r\n\r\n     In view of the fearless heroism and steady adherence to principle\r\n     of many comparatively unknown lives, the historian is painfully\r\n     conscious of the meagerness of the record, as compared with the\r\n     amount of labor that must necessarily have been performed. In\r\n     almost every city, village and school district some earnest man\r\n     or woman has been quietly waging the great moral battle that will\r\n     eventually make us free; and while it would be a labor of love to\r\n     recognize every one who has wrought for freedom, doubtless many\r\n     names worthy of mention may unintentionally be omitted.\r\n\r\n     The earliest account of specific work that we have been able to\r\n     trace is an address delivered in Earlville by A. J. Grover, esq.,\r\n     in 1855, who from that time until the present has been an able\r\n     champion of the constitutional rights of women. As a result of\r\n     his efforts, and the discussion that followed, a society was\r\n     formed, of which Mrs. Susan Hoxie Richardson (a cousin of Susan\r\n     B. Anthony) was elected president, and Mrs. Octavia Grover\r\n     secretary. This, we believe, was the first suffrage society in\r\n     Illinois. Its influence was increased by the fact that, during\r\n     two years of Mr. Grover's editorial control, the Earlville\r\n     _Transcript_ was a fearless champion of equal rights. While that\r\n     band of pioneers was actively at work, Prudence Crandall, who was\r\n     mobbed and imprisoned in Connecticut for teaching a school for\r\n     colored girls, was actively engaged in Mendota, in the same\r\n     county. A few years later, lectures were delivered[351] on the\r\n     subject of equal rights for women in different parts of the\r\n     State.\r\n\r\n     Copies of two of the early appeals have been secured. One by A.\r\n     J. Grover, published in pamphlet form, was extensively\r\n     circulated; the other by Mrs. Catharine V. Waite, appeared in the\r\n     Earlville _Transcript_. Both of these documents are yellowed with\r\n     age, but the arguments presented are as logical as the more\r\n     recent utterances of our most radical champions. There is a\r\n     tradition of a convention at Galesburg some years later, but we\r\n     have failed to find any accurate data. During the interim between\r\n     these dates and that never-to-be-forgotten April day in 1861, but\r\n     little agitation of this great subject can be traced, and during\r\n     the six years subsequent to that time we witness all previously\r\n     defined boundaries of spheres brushed away like cobwebs, when\r\n     women, north and south, were obliged to fill the places made\r\n     vacant by our civil war. An adequate record of the work\r\n     accomplished during those eventful years by Illinois women,\r\n     notably among them being Mary A. Livermore and Jane C. Hoge, lies\r\n     before us in a bound volume of the paper published under the\r\n     auspices of the Northwestern Sanitary Fair, edited by the Hon.\r\n     Andrew Shuman. This little journal was called the _Voice of the\r\n     Fair_, a prophetic name, as really through the medium of these\r\n     sanitary fairs were the voices of the _fair_ all potent, and\r\n     through their patriotic services to our soldiery did the women of\r\n     the United States first discover their talent for managing and\r\n     administering great enterprises. In his first editorial\r\n     Lieutenant-Governor Shuman says:\r\n\r\n          On motion of Mrs. Elizabeth A. Loomis, it was decided to\r\n          open the fair on February 22, 1865, Washington's birthday,\r\n          and to continue it till March 4, the presidential\r\n          inauguration day. A committee, consisting of Mrs. H. H.\r\n          Hoge, Mrs. D. P. Livermore and Mrs. E. W. Blatchford for the\r\n          commission, and Mrs. O. E. Hosmer, Mrs. C. P. Dickinson and\r\n          Mr. L. B. Bryan for the Home, was appointed as executive.\r\n          This was the little cloud, scarcely larger than a man's\r\n          hand, which grew till it almost encircled the heavens,\r\n          spreading into every corner of our broad land, and including\r\n          every department of industry in its ample details.\r\n\r\n     The undertaking was herculean, and on the grand occasion of the\r\n     opening of the fair, although we do not find any account of women\r\n     sharing in the honors of the day, yet they were vouchsafed\r\n     honorable mention in the following terms by the governor of the\r\n     State: \"I do not know how to praise women, but I can say nothing\r\n     so good as our late president once said on a similar occasion,\r\n     'God bless the women of America.' They have been our faithful\r\n     allies during this fearful war. They have toiled steadily by our\r\n     side, with the most enduring constancy through the frightful\r\n     contest.\" Amid the first impulses of genuine gratitude men\r\n     recognized what at present they seem to forget, that by\r\n     inheritance and patriotic service woman has an equal right with\r\n     man to a share in the rights and privileges of this government.\r\n\r\n     In the winter of 1860 Hannah Tracy Cutler, M. D., and Mrs.\r\n     Frances D. Gage made a canvass of the interior and western parts\r\n     of the State, procuring signatures to petitions asking for\r\n     equality before the law, and especially for the right of married\r\n     women to earn and hold and dispose of property the same as a\r\n     _feme-sole_. Also, that property acquired before marriage, or\r\n     that may afterward accrue to a married woman by gift, devise,\r\n     descent or deed, may be held, controlled and disposed of by\r\n     herself where it had not been intentionally converted to common\r\n     property by her consent. In response to a request for data on\r\n     this point, Mrs. Cutler writes:\r\n\r\n          At the close of our campaign we were summoned to Ohio to\r\n          assist in the canvass in that State. Returning to Illinois,\r\n          I learned that no action had been taken on our petitions.\r\n          The member to whom we had consigned them, and who had\r\n          promised to act in our behalf, had found no convenient\r\n          opportunity. I at once repaired to Springfield, and, on\r\n          inquiry, was told that it was now too late in the\r\n          session--that members were so busy that no one could be\r\n          induced to draft a bill for an act granting such laws as we\r\n          desired. I found one member ready to assist to the full\r\n          measure of his ability--Mr. Pickett of Rock Island. By his\r\n          encouragement I went to the State library and there drew up\r\n          a bill giving women, during coverture, certain personal and\r\n          property rights. Mr. Pickett presented our petitions, got a\r\n          special committee, took my bill before it, got a favorable\r\n          report, and a law was passed to that effect. Some decisions\r\n          occurred under this law. I think, however, that in a\r\n          codification a year or two after, this law was left out, I\r\n          know not by what authority, and some years later Mrs.\r\n          Livermore, Mrs. Bradwell and others presented the matter\r\n          afresh, and succeeded in procuring again a similar\r\n          enactment. The winter following I presented petitions for\r\n          the right of guardianship; also, I asked that for estates\r\n          not exceeding $5,000 the widow should not be required to\r\n          take out letters of administration, but should be permitted\r\n          to continue in possession, the same as the husband on the\r\n          decease of the wife, the property subject to the same\r\n          liabilities for the payment of debts and the maintenance of\r\n          children as before the decease of the husband. I made this\r\n          small claim for the relief of many wives whose husbands had\r\n          gone into the army, leaving them with all the\r\n          responsibility; and there seemed no sufficient reason for\r\n          disturbing and distributing either the family or the estate,\r\n          when the husband exchanged the battle-field for the \"sleep\r\n          that knows no waking.\" This petition, asking for these\r\n          reasonable and righteous laws, was, by motion of Colonel\r\n          Mack, in a spirit of burlesque, referred to the Committee on\r\n          Internal Navigation, and a burlesque report was made in open\r\n          Senate, too indecent to be entered on the records. The grave\r\n          and reverend seigniors, on this, indulged in a hearty\r\n          guffaw, hugely enjoyed by his honor Lieutenant-Governor\r\n          Hoffman, and, to this day, no further action has been taken\r\n          to give the wife and mother this small modicum of justice,\r\n          though many of the senators at that time promised the\r\n          question an early consideration.\r\n\r\n     On Saturday, October 3, 1868, a genuine sensation was produced by\r\n     the appearance of the Chicago _Legal News_, edited by Mrs. Myra\r\n     Bradwell. At this day it is impossible to realize with what\r\n     supreme astonishment this journal was received. Neither can we\r\n     estimate its influence upon the subsequent legislation of the\r\n     State. Looking through its files we find that no opportunity was\r\n     lost for exposing all laws unjust to woman, or for noting each\r\n     indication of progress throughout the world. Under date of\r\n     October 31, 1868, a short article in regard to the \"Citizenship\r\n     of Women\" reads thus:\r\n\r\n          The act of congress provides that any alien, being a free\r\n          white person, may become a citizen of the United States.\r\n          While congress was very careful to limit this great\r\n          privilege of citizenship to the free white person, it made\r\n          no distinction or limitation whatever on account of sex.\r\n          Under this statute it has been held that a married woman\r\n          may be naturalized and become a citizen of the United\r\n          States, and that, too, without the consent of her husband. A\r\n          woman may be a citizen of the United States, be subject to\r\n          the laws, own property, and be compelled to pay taxes to\r\n          support a government she has no voice in administering or\r\n          vote in electing its officers.\r\n\r\n     In the same issue of the _News_ we meet with an earnest appeal\r\n     for the prompt passage of a law conferring upon woman a right to\r\n     her earnings. When we realize that one of the Supreme Judges soon\r\n     after this assured Mrs. Bradwell that she was editing a paper\r\n     that no lawyer could afford to do without, we shall understand\r\n     how important a part this journal has played in the courts. In\r\n     the sixth number of the _News_ we find the attention of the legal\r\n     fraternity called to the fact that in the reign of James I. it\r\n     was held in the cases of _Coats vs. Lyall_ and _Holt vs. Lyall_,\r\n     tried in Westminster Hall, that a single woman, if a freeholder,\r\n     had the right to vote for a parliament man; and in the reign of\r\n     Queen Elizabeth, Lady Packington, in right of property held by\r\n     her, did actually vote for a return of two burgesses to\r\n     parliament for the borough of Aylesburg; and in the time of\r\n     Charles I., Mrs. Copley voted, in right of her property, for the\r\n     return of a burgess for Gratton. The subject of their return was\r\n     brought before parliament, and amended by joining other persons\r\n     with Mrs. Copley in the right of returning burgesses for Gratton.\r\n     Women have actually sat and voted in the English parliament.\r\n\r\n     In 1868, Sorosis, a woman's club, was organized in Chicago, with\r\n     Mrs. Delia Waterman president, and soon after several periodicals\r\n     were established; _The Chicago Sorosis_, with Mrs. Mary L.\r\n     Walker, Cynthia Leonard and Agnes L. Knowlton, editors; _The\r\n     Inland Monthly_, Mrs. Charlotte Clark, editor and publisher; and\r\n     _The Agitator_, with Mary A. Livermore and Mary L. Walker\r\n     editors. Though all were short-lived, they serve to show woman's\r\n     ambition in the direction of journalism.\r\n\r\n     In 1868 there was a decided \"awakening\" on the question of woman\r\n     suffrage in central Illinois. In the town of Elmwood, Peoria\r\n     county, the question drew large audiences to lyceum discussions,\r\n     and was argued in school, church and caucus. The conservatives\r\n     became alarmed, and announced their determination to \"nip the\r\n     innovation in the bud.\" A spirited editorial in the New York\r\n     _Independent_ was based upon the following facts, given by\r\n     request of some of the disfranchised women:\r\n\r\n          Rev. W. G. Pierce was the pastor of the Elmwood\r\n          Congregational Church. A large majority of the members were\r\n          women, and there was no discrimination against them in the\r\n          church manual. The pastor and two or three members decided\r\n          that a change of rules was needed. A church meeting was held\r\n          in March, 1868, at which the number in attendance was very\r\n          small, owing to some irregularities in issuing the call. The\r\n          suffrage question was brought up by the pastor, and the talk\r\n          soon became so insulting that the women present felt\r\n          compelled to leave the house. The manual was then amended so\r\n          as to exclude women from voting \"in matters pertaining to\r\n          the welfare of the church,\" and making a two-thirds vote of\r\n          adult males necessary to any change thereafter. This was\r\n          carried by five yeas to one nay--only six votes out of a\r\n          membership of 210! The church was taken by surprise, and\r\n          there was no little excitement when the fact became known\r\n          next day. A vigorous protest and a call for reconsideration\r\n          was quickly signed by nearly a hundred members and sent to\r\n          the pastor. The meeting was not called for weeks, and when\r\n          at last it was secured, he, as moderator, ruled\r\n          reconsideration out, on the ground that there was an error\r\n          in the announcement of the business (by himself!) from the\r\n          pulpit. At a later meeting a vote on reconsideration was\r\n          reached, and enough of the male adult minority were in\r\n          attendance to make the vote stand 19 to 17, not two-thirds\r\n          of the male adult element voting for reconsideration.\r\n\r\n          The contention now became bitter, and twenty-eight of the\r\n          more intelligent and earnest members withdrew and asked for\r\n          letters to other churches. Such of the \"adult males\" as\r\n          \"tarried by the altar,\" refused to give the outgoing members\r\n          the usual letters, to join in a mutual council on an equal\r\n          footing, or to discipline the seceders. The latter called an\r\n          ex-parte council, composed of such men as Dr. Bascom, of\r\n          Princeton; Dr. Edward Beecher, of Galesburg; Dr. Haven, of\r\n          Evanston; Dr. C. D. Helmer, of Chicago, and others. This\r\n          council gave the desired letters, but advised\r\n          reconciliation. Among the seceders, Mrs. Huldah Joy, an\r\n          educated and intensely religious woman, was one of the most\r\n          active and earnest, her husband, F. R. Joy, and her\r\n          daughters, also doing good service. Mrs. H. E.\r\n          Sunderland,[352] another woman of culture, and Mrs. Mary Ann\r\n          Cone and Mrs. S. R. Murray were faithful, brave and earnest.\r\n          The church, which previous to the secession, was strong and\r\n          flourishing, became an inharmonious organization, and has\r\n          never rallied from the effects of that unjust action.\r\n\r\n     At a meeting held in Chicago, in the autumn of 1868, a resolution\r\n     was offered to the effect that \"a State association be formed,\r\n     having for its object the advocacy of universal suffrage.\" Among\r\n     the many interesting facts connected with the \"rise and progress\"\r\n     of the equal-rights movement is the large number of\r\n     representative men and women who have from the first been\r\n     identified with it.[353] January 25, 1860 we find among the most\r\n     progressive utterances from the pulpit, a sermon by the Rev.\r\n     Sumner Ellis of Chicago, while Rev. Charles Fowler and Dr. H. W.\r\n     Thomas were ever fearless and earnest in their advocacy of this\r\n     measure. In February, 1869, the _Legal News_ said:\r\n\r\n          A call has been issued, inviting all persons in favor of\r\n          woman suffrage to meet in convention in Library Hall,\r\n          Chicago. There are many hundred names appended, including\r\n          the judges of all the courts of Cook county, leading members\r\n          of the bar throughout the State, representatives of the\r\n          press, ministers of the gospel, from all denominations, and\r\n          representatives from every profession and business.\r\n          Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and the Rev.\r\n          Olympia Brown have been invited and are expected to attend.\r\n\r\n     Pursuant to the foregoing \"call,\" a notable convention was\r\n     held.[354] The _Tribune_ devoted nine columns to an account of\r\n     the proceedings, respectful in tone and fair in statement. During\r\n     its two days' session, Library Hall was packed to its utmost\r\n     capacity with the beauty and fashion of the city. Able lawyers,\r\n     eloquent and distinguished divines and gallant generals occupied\r\n     seats upon the platform and took part in the deliberations. The\r\n     special importance of this convention at this time, was the\r\n     consideration of the immediate duty of securing a recognition of\r\n     the rights of women in the new constitution, for the framing of\r\n     which a convention had been called.\r\n\r\n     All the speakers had strong convictions and showed broad\r\n     differences, continually making sharp points against each other.\r\n     Several clergymen were present, some in favor of woman suffrage,\r\n     some opposed, some in doubt. Among these were the two\r\n     Collyers--one, the Rev. Robert, the English blacksmith of former\r\n     days, liberal, progressive, of large physical proportions; the\r\n     other, the Rev. Robert Laird, a much smaller man, and of\r\n     conservative tendencies.\r\n\r\n          The Rev. Robert Collyer dissented so entirely from what the\r\n          preceding speaker, Dr. Hammond, had said, that he was\r\n          determined to run the risk of attempting to reply. He\r\n          thought that a majority of men who began by being reformers,\r\n          ended by being old fogies, and he thought that might be the\r\n          case with Mr. Hammond. He felt no doubt that the whole\r\n          movement of women's rights was to be established in America.\r\n          He had seen the effects of woman's presence in associations\r\n          upon men, and he was sure that this same agency would have\r\n          the effect of bringing politics to such a condition as that\r\n          decent people of either sex might take part in it. As to the\r\n          Bible declaring that man shall rule over woman, he found a\r\n          similar case where it used to be quoted in support of the\r\n          institution of slavery, but when the grander and more\r\n          beautiful principles of the Bible came to be applied the\r\n          contrary was clearly established. So it was with the\r\n          question of woman's rights. To him the Bible seemed like an\r\n          immense pasture wherein any and every species of animal\r\n          might find its own peculiar food. In regard to what Mr.\r\n          Hammond said as to the rights of infants, he wished he had\r\n          conferred with his wife and got her approval before he said\r\n          it. The speaker was sure his own wife would not have advised\r\n          him to say it. He believed that when maternal and home\r\n          duties conflicted, the children and the home relations would\r\n          take the preference invariably, and the remarks of Mr.\r\n          Hammond seemed to imply a terrible want of confidence in\r\n          woman. He believed that woman would always do her duty to\r\n          her children and her home. Then, too, he had been surprised,\r\n          that Mr. Hammond, in speaking of preventing children from\r\n          coming into the world, had failed to speak of the\r\n          complicity of man, in reality the greatest criminal, in that\r\n          matter. As to the excitement attendant upon political\r\n          issues, was it worse, viewed as mere excitement, than that\r\n          which is so earnestly sought to be aroused at religious\r\n          meetings? Elizabeth, Anne, and Victoria were, with the\r\n          exception, perhaps, of Cromwell, the best rulers England\r\n          ever had, and, when the administration of Andrew Johnson was\r\n          remembered, he thought we might do worse than to have a\r\n          woman for president, after Grant's term shall have expired.\r\n          [Applause.] In conclusion, Mr. Collyer said that, even if\r\n          the fearful picture drawn by Mr. Hammond, of 70,000 immoral\r\n          women marching to the polls in New York, were realized, he\r\n          could draw another picture--that of 75,000 good and pure\r\n          women marching to the polls to vote the others down.\r\n          [Applause.]\r\n\r\n          Rev. Edward Beecher, of Galesburg, said: Exclusive class\r\n          legislation was not safe; it was oppressive and degrading.\r\n          Female influence has procured the repeal of some obnoxious\r\n          laws, and that proved it was a powerful element. He thought\r\n          the Bible, as regards man being the head, had been\r\n          misinterpreted. When man took the attitude in relation to\r\n          women which Christ sustains to the church, that of love, of\r\n          service, of helpfulness and sacrifice, he would be an\r\n          example of true headship. He read an extract from an\r\n          editorial in the _Tribune_, of February 11, in regard to the\r\n          giving way of moral integrity in the affairs of the nation,\r\n          and commended the question to the consideration of all. The\r\n          country was never in greater danger than now of having the\r\n          whole political system destroyed. Some great moral influence\r\n          ought to be brought to eradicate the corruption so prevalent\r\n          among public men. There were two great vices in\r\n          existence--drunkenness and licentiousness--and in both,\r\n          woman was the victim of man in the majority of cases. The\r\n          legislation which pressed down women was wrong, and should\r\n          be remedied. He admitted it was an experiment to introduce\r\n          the female element into legislation, but the success of the\r\n          male element had thus far been such that, according to his\r\n          judgment, things could not be much worse than they are.\r\n          Women were always deeply interested in all public questions.\r\n          If responsibilities were put upon them they would become\r\n          greater intellectually, morally and socially.\r\n\r\n     Several able lawyers also took part in the convention, who\r\n     brought their legal learning to bear on the question. Mrs.\r\n     Stanton and Miss Anthony, hostile to the action of the Republican\r\n     party as manifested in the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments,\r\n     were present with their stern criticisms and scathing resolutions\r\n     on \"manhood suffrage,\" submitting the following to the\r\n     convention:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That a man's government is worse than a white\r\n          man's government, because in proportion as you increase the\r\n          rulers you make the condition of the ostracised more\r\n          hopeless and degraded.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That as the Democratic cry of \"a white man's\r\n          government\" created an antagonism between the Irish and the\r\n          negro, culminating in the New York riots of '63, so the\r\n          Republican cry of \"manhood suffrage\" creates an antagonism\r\n          between the black man and all women, and will culminate in\r\n          fearful outrages on womanhood, especially in the Southern\r\n          States.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That by the establishment of an aristocracy of\r\n          sex in the District of Columbia, by the introduction of the\r\n          word \"male\" into the federal constitution in article XIV.,\r\n          section 2, and by the proposition to enforce manhood\r\n          suffrage in all the States of the Union, the Republican\r\n          party has been guilty of three successive arbitrary acts,\r\n          three retrogressive steps in legislation, alike invidious\r\n          and insulting to women and suicidal to the nation.\r\n\r\n     After a long and earnest discussion, the resolutions were voted\r\n     down. Mrs. Stanton's speech setting forth six reasons against a\r\n     \"male aristocracy\"[355] was pronounced able and eloquent, though\r\n     directly in opposition to the general sentiment of the\r\n     convention, which was mainly Republican. Miss Anna Dickinson,\r\n     having a lyceum engagement in Chicago, was present at one of the\r\n     sessions, and had quite a spirited encounter with Robert Laird\r\n     Collier. As she appeared on the platform at the close of some\r\n     remarks by that gentleman, loud calls were made for her, when she\r\n     came forward and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n          MRS. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: It is impossible for\r\n          me to continue in my seat after so kind and cordial a call\r\n          from this house, and I thank you for the pleasant and\r\n          friendly feeling you have shown. I have but a word to say. I\r\n          had gone out of the room, not because of the discussion, but\r\n          because it was too warm and the atmosphere so stifling, when\r\n          I was recalled by hearing something to this effect: \"That\r\n          there had not been a single logical argument used on this\r\n          platform in behalf of woman suffrage; that woman is\r\n          abundantly represented by some man of her family; that when\r\n          a woman lifts herself up in opposition against her husband,\r\n          she lifts herself up, if I properly and rightly understood\r\n          the declaration, against God; that the inspired assertion is\r\n          that the husband is the head of the wife.\" Oh! but Mr.\r\n          Collier forgot to say the husband is the head of the wife as\r\n          Christ is the head of the church. In my observation, and it\r\n          has not been a limited one, though I confess I am not an\r\n          unprejudiced observer, I have never yet discovered a man who\r\n          is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church.\r\n          Furthermore, he announces that these women, being\r\n          represented by men, if they lift themselves up in opposition\r\n          to their husbands, lose that womanly and feminine element\r\n          which is so admirable and pure and beautiful, and nothing\r\n          can preserve them from the contamination of politics. Woman\r\n          is to lift herself against God if she lifts herself against\r\n          her husband, and woman is abundantly represented by this\r\n          same husband, or by some man in her own family. There are a\r\n          multitude of women who have no husbands [laughter]. There\r\n          are a multitude of women who never will have any husbands\r\n          [renewed laughter]. There are a great many women who have no\r\n          men in their own households to represent them, either for\r\n          their wrongs or their rights. Mr. Collier, I suppose,\r\n          however, is talking about women who have husbands.\r\n\r\n          He says the woman loses her purity, her delicacy, her\r\n          feminine attributes when she lifts her voice and sentiments\r\n          against the man whose name she bears. We will say, then,\r\n          look across these western prairies to Utah. If the women\r\n          there dare to say to the congress of the United States,\r\n          \"Amend this constitution that we women of Utah can have one\r\n          husband, and that the husband can take but one wife\"; if\r\n          these women demand decency in the marriage relation, demand\r\n          justice for themselves, demand purity, they are lifting\r\n          themselves against the laws of womanhood and the laws of\r\n          God. Every woman represented by her husband is to lose her\r\n          purity, her delicacy, her refinement, if she dares to lift\r\n          her hand against him and his will. You have here, within the\r\n          limits of your State of Illinois, 100,000 drunkards. Every\r\n          woman who dares to lift her hand, cry out with her voice,\r\n          \"Give me the ballot that may offset the votes of these\r\n          drunkards at the polls and save my children from starvation\r\n          and myself from being put into the workhouse\"--this woman is\r\n          lifting herself against the laws of God and womanhood. That\r\n          is not all! Last summer this question of prohibition was\r\n          being tested in Massachusetts by votes. I went from town to\r\n          town--my engagements taking me all over the State at that\r\n          time--and said my say upon this question of woman suffrage.\r\n          In whatever city or town I went, women, bowed down with\r\n          grief, who desired to preserve their womanhood, their\r\n          persons from blows and abuse, their sons from going to\r\n          gambling hells and rum shops, their girls from being sent to\r\n          houses of abomination, came to me and said: \"Anna Dickinson,\r\n          if you are a woman, speak and use your influence for our\r\n          cause.\" Women who have drunken husbands, whether they lived\r\n          in Beacon street or at the North End, whether they lived in\r\n          luxury or poverty, said: \"For the sake of womanhood, for the\r\n          sake of motherhood, for the sake of all things good and true\r\n          in the world, lift up our hands and voices, through\r\n          yourself, to protest against these men whose names we bear.\"\r\n          Ah! that Mr. Collier could have seen these drunkards' wives,\r\n          standing with tears streaming down their cheeks, and\r\n          begging for power, begging for the ballot to save their\r\n          homes, and themselves, and their children. Do you tell this\r\n          audience--do you tell any mother or daughter here this\r\n          afternoon, that she protests against the purity of\r\n          womanhood, and lifts her powers against the laws of God?\r\n          Pardon me for taking this much of your time. I will simply\r\n          add a thought. This is the cause of purity. This is the\r\n          cause which is to strengthen young girls, which is to give\r\n          them self-reliance and self-respect. This is the thing that\r\n          is to put these girls on their feet; say to them \"you are an\r\n          independent being; you are to earn the clothes that cover\r\n          you,\" and this will allow them to walk with steady feet\r\n          through rough places. This thing which is to give these\r\n          women such power, certainly will be strengthening to them by\r\n          making them independent and self-reliant. The ballot is to\r\n          save womanhood and save purity, which he says is in\r\n          danger--the feminine element of dependence and weakness and\r\n          tenderness, of clinging helplessness, which he so much\r\n          adores. Let justice be done. Give us the ballot. Here is the\r\n          power to defend yourself when your rights are assailed; when\r\n          your home is entered. Here is the authority to tell the\r\n          spoiler to stand back; when our sons are being brought up to\r\n          wickedness and our daughters to lives of shame, here is the\r\n          power in the mother's hand which says these children shall\r\n          be taken from the wrong place and put in the right one. For\r\n          the rights of mothers I plead. Let us allow, from one end of\r\n          this country to the other, every man and woman, black and\r\n          white, to go to the polls to defend their own rights and the\r\n          rights of their homes.\r\n\r\n          The Rev. R. L. COLLIER said he would to God that every woman\r\n          in America had such a heart and such a voice for woman's\r\n          rights. But sympathy was one thing and logic was another. If\r\n          he thought the ballot in the hand of woman would cure the\r\n          wrongs she speaks of, he would favor female suffrage, but he\r\n          was firmly convinced that it would only aggravate their\r\n          wrongs. He could not fight Anna Dickinson.\r\n\r\n          ANNA DICKINSON: I certainly do not intend to fight Mr.\r\n          Collier. I believe I have the name of not being a\r\n          belligerent woman. Mr. Collier says sympathy is one thing\r\n          and logic is another. Very true! I did not speak of the\r\n          40,000 women in the State of Massachusetts who are wives of\r\n          drunkards, as a matter which shall appeal to your\r\n          sympathies, or move your tears. Mr. Collier says that these\r\n          women are to find their rights by influence at home.\r\n\r\n          Mr. COLLIER: That is what I mean.\r\n\r\n          Miss DICKINSON: That they are to do it by womanly and\r\n          feminine love, and I tell him that is the duty of this same\r\n          feminine element which is so admirable and adorable. I have\r\n          seen men on your street corners, as I have seen men on the\r\n          street corners of every city of America, with bloated faces,\r\n          with mangled forms, and eyes blackened by the horrible vice\r\n          and orgies carried on in their dens of iniquity and\r\n          drunkenness and sin. I have seen men with not a semblance of\r\n          humanity in their form or in their face, and not a sentiment\r\n          of manhood in their souls. I have seen these men made\r\n          absolute masters of wives and children; men who reel to\r\n          their homes night after night to beat some helpless child;\r\n          to beat some helpless woman. A woman was beaten here in\r\n          Chicago the other day until there was scarcely a trace of\r\n          the woman's face left, and scarcely a trace of the woman's\r\n          form remaining. Mr. Collier tells me, then, that these women\r\n          whose husbands reel home at 12, 1, 2, 3 o'clock at night, to\r\n          demolish the furniture, beat the children, and destroy their\r\n          wives' peace and lives--that these women are to find their\r\n          rights by influence, by argument, by tenderness. These\r\n          brutes who deserve the gallows if any human being can\r\n          deserve anything so atrocious in these days--are these\r\n          women, their wives, to find their safety, their security for\r\n          themselves and their children, by influence, through\r\n          argument and tenderness, or love, when nothing can influence\r\n          save drink? The law gives man the power to say, \"I will have\r\n          drink; I will put this into my mouth.\" If the ballot were\r\n          given to women they would vote against drunkenness. It is\r\n          not sentiment, it is logic, if there be any logic in votes\r\n          and in a home saved.\r\n\r\n          The Rev. R. L. COLLIER, in reply to Miss Dickinson, quoted a\r\n          story from an English author of a drunkard who was reclaimed\r\n          by a daughter's love and devotion. He never wanted to hear a\r\n          woman say that law could accomplish what love could not.\r\n\r\n          Miss DICKINSON: I only want to ask Mr. Collier a question,\r\n          and it is this: Whether he does not think that man would\r\n          have been a great deal better off if this woman's vote could\r\n          have offset his vote, and the rum thereby prevented from\r\n          being sold at the outset?\r\n\r\n          Mr. COLLIER: I wish to say that law never yet cured crime;\r\n          that men are not our only drunkards. Women are drunkards as\r\n          well as men.\r\n\r\n          Miss DICKINSON (excitedly): It is not so, in anything like\r\n          the same proportion; a drunken woman is a rare sight.\r\n\r\n          Mr. COLLIER: I wish to say that intemperance can never be\r\n          cured by law.\r\n\r\n          Miss DICKINSON: Very well. You tell me that there are woman\r\n          in the land who are drunkards. Doubtless there are. Then I\r\n          stand here as a woman to entreat, to beseech, to pray\r\n          against this sin. For the sake of these drunken woman, I ask\r\n          the ballot to drag them back from the rum-shops and shut\r\n          their doors [applause]. God forbid that I should underrate\r\n          the power of love; that I should discard tenderness. Let us\r\n          have entreaty, let us have prayers, and let us have the\r\n          ballot, to eradicate this evil. Mr. Collier says he is full\r\n          of sympathy, and intimates that women should stand here and\r\n          elevate love above law. So long as a man can be influenced\r\n          by love, well and good. When a man has sunk to the point\r\n          where he beats his wife and children, and burns the house\r\n          over them, reduces his family to starvation to get this\r\n          accursed drink; when a man has sunk to such a level, is\r\n          woman to stand still and entreat? Is this all woman is to\r\n          do? No! She is to have the power added that will drag the\r\n          firebrand out of his hand, and when sense and reason return,\r\n          when the fire is extinguished, then, I say, let us have the\r\n          power of love to interfere. I think keeping a man out of sin\r\n          is better than trying to drag him out afterward by love.\r\n\r\n          Mr. COLLIER said he was placed in a false position of\r\n          prominence because, unfortunately, he was the only gentleman\r\n          on the platform who entertained serious convictions on the\r\n          negative side of the subject. The only question was, would\r\n          the ballot cure these wrongs? If so, he would like to hear\r\n          the reasons, philosophical and logical, set forth. The\r\n          appeals that had been made to the convention were illogical\r\n          and sympathetic. He believed the persecutors of women were\r\n          women. Fashion and the prejudice in the minds of women had\r\n          been the barriers to their own elevation. That the ballot in\r\n          the hands of women would cure these evils he denied.\r\n\r\n          Miss DICKINSON: Mr. Collier says, \"The worst enemies of\r\n          women are women\"; that the worst opponents of this measure\r\n          are fashion, dress and idleness. I confess there are no\r\n          bitterer opponents or enemies of this measure than women. On\r\n          that very ground I assert that the ballot will prove woman's\r\n          best friend. If woman has something else to think about than\r\n          simply to please men, something else than the splendor of\r\n          her diamonds, or the magnificence of her carriage, you may\r\n          be sure, with broader fields to survey, it would be a good\r\n          thing for her. If women could earn their bread and buy the\r\n          houses over their heads, in honorable and lucrative\r\n          avocations; if they stood in the eye of the law men's\r\n          equals, there would be better work, more hopeful hearts,\r\n          more Christian magnanimity, and less petty selfishness and\r\n          meanness than, I confess with sorrow and tears, are found\r\n          among women to-day.\r\n\r\n     One of the ablest speeches of the convention was made by Judge\r\n     Chas. B. Waite, on woman's position before the law. Immediately\r\n     after this enthusiastic convention[356] the Illinois State\r\n     Suffrage Association was formed, a committee[357] appointed to\r\n     visit Springfield and request the legislature to so \"change the\r\n     laws that the earnings of a married woman may be secured to her\r\n     own use; that married women may have the same right to their own\r\n     property that married men have; and that the mother may have an\r\n     equal right with the father to the custody of the children.\" The\r\n     need of such a committee existed in that year of 1869, and they\r\n     seemed to have wrought effective service, since on March 24 the\r\n     married woman's earnings act was approved.\r\n\r\n          AN ACT _in Relation to the Earnings of Married Women._\r\n\r\n          SEC. 1.--Be it enacted by the people of the State of\r\n          Illinois, represented in the General Assembly, That a\r\n          married woman shall be entitled to receive, use and possess\r\n          her own earnings, and sue for the same in her own name, free\r\n          from the interference of her husband or his creditors:\r\n          _Provided_, This act shall not be construed to give to the\r\n          wife any compensation for any labor performed for her minor\r\n          children or husband.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Livermore, Mrs. Stanton, Judge Waite, Judge and Mrs.\r\n     Bradwell, had an enthusiastic meeting in the Opera House,\r\n     Springfield, most of the members of the legislature being\r\n     present.\r\n\r\n     September 9, 10, 1869, the Western Convention was held in Library\r\n     Hall, Chicago; Mrs. Livermore presided. This influential\r\n     gathering was largely attended by leading friends from other\r\n     States.[358] Mrs. Kate Doggett and Dr. Mary Safford were\r\n     appointed to attend the Woman's Industrial Congress at Berlin.\r\n     Letters were read from Wm. Lloyd Garrison and others.[359]\r\n\r\n     February 8, 9, 1870, the first annual meeting of the State\r\n     Association was held at Springfield in the Opera House, Hon.\r\n     James B. Bradwell in the chair. Many members of the legislature\r\n     were present during the various sessions and a hearing[360]\r\n     before the House was granted next day. Resolutions were discussed\r\n     and adopted, declaring that women were enfranchised under the\r\n     fourteenth amendment. As a constitutional convention was in\r\n     session, and there was an effort being made to have an amendment\r\n     for woman suffrage submitted to a vote of the people, greater\r\n     interest was felt in all that was said at this convention.\r\n\r\n     The strange inconsistency of the opponents of woman suffrage was\r\n     perhaps never more fully illustrated than by the following\r\n     occurrence: While the patriotic and earnest women of Illinois\r\n     were quietly acting upon the advice of their representatives, and\r\n     relying upon their \"quiet, moral influence\" to secure a just\r\n     recognition of their rights in the constitutional convention, a\r\n     conservative woman of Michigan, who, afraid that the women of\r\n     Illinois were about to lose their womanliness by asking for the\r\n     right to have their opinions counted, deserted her home in the\r\n     Peninsular State, went to Springfield, secured the hall of the\r\n     convention, and gave two lectures against woman suffrage. A\r\n     meeting was called at the close of the second lecture, and in a\r\n     resolution moved by a member of the convention, as Mrs. Bradwell\r\n     pertinently says, \"the people of the State were told that _one\r\n     woman_ had proved herself competent and well qualified to\r\n     enlighten the constitutional convention upon the evils of woman\r\n     suffrage.\"[361] Such was the effect of this self-appointed\r\n     obtruder from another State that the members of the convention,\r\n     without giving a woman of their own State opportunity for reply,\r\n     not only struck out the clause submitting the question to the\r\n     people in a separate article, but actually incorporated in the\r\n     body of the constitution a clause which would not allow a woman\r\n     to hold any office, public position, place of trust or emolument\r\n     in the State. Through the efforts of such staunch friends as\r\n     Judge Bradwell, Judge Waite and others, this latter clause was\r\n     stricken out, and one inserted which, under a fair construction,\r\n     will allow a woman to hold almost any office, provided she\r\n     receives a sufficient number of votes.\r\n\r\n     By the accidental insertion of another clause in the constitution\r\n     under consideration, Section 1, of Article VII., any foreign born\r\n     woman, naturalized previous to January, 1870, was given the right\r\n     to vote. So that Illinois was the first State in the Union, since\r\n     the time when the women of New Jersey were disfranchised, to give\r\n     to foreign-born women the elective franchise. This mistake of the\r\n     wise Solons was guarded as a State secret.\r\n\r\n     Previous to the great fire of 1871, the most popular and\r\n     influential woman's club in Chicago was the organization known as\r\n     Sorosis. This club, by the generous aid of many prominent\r\n     gentlemen of the city, established pleasant headquarters, where,\r\n     in addition to bright carpets and artistic decorations, were\r\n     books, flowers, birds, and other refined accessories. Mrs.\r\n     Elizabeth Loomis says of the meetings held in those delightful\r\n     parlors: \"At every successive session we could see that we were\r\n     gaining ground and receiving influential members. I well remember\r\n     how it encouraged us to number the Rev. Dr. Thomas among our\r\n     friends; and how gladly I made the motion to have him appointed\r\n     temporary chairman in the absence of the president--a position\r\n     which he cheerfully accepted.\" One of the most brilliant reunions\r\n     ever enjoyed by the club, was a reception given to Mrs. Stanton\r\n     and Miss Anthony, as they were _en route_ to California, early in\r\n     June, 1871. Of this reception, Miss Anthony, in a letter from Des\r\n     Moines, Iowa, to _The Revolution_, said: \"Mrs. Stanton and I were\r\n     in Chicago the evening the Illinois State and Cook County\r\n     Association held their opening reception at their new central\r\n     bureau, a suite of fine rooms handsomely carpeted and furnished\r\n     by prominent merchants of the city, where, with music,\r\n     conversation, speeches, etc., the hours passed delightfully\r\n     away,\" forming, as Miss Anthony might have added, a delightful\r\n     oasis amid the many discomforts of a continuous appeal to the\r\n     people to deal justly.\r\n\r\n     In November, 1871, Mrs. Catharine V. Waite, of Hyde Park, made a\r\n     written application to the board of registration, asking them to\r\n     place her name upon the register as a voter, which they refused\r\n     to do on the ground that she was a woman, whereupon Mrs. Waite\r\n     filed a petition in the Supreme Court of Cook county, stating the\r\n     facts, and praying that the board be compelled by mandamus to\r\n     place her name upon the register. Chief-Justice Jameson granted\r\n     an alternative writ, returnable on the following Monday,\r\n     commanding the board to show cause, if any they have, why Mrs.\r\n     Waite's name should not be placed upon the register. Judge\r\n     Charles B. Waite, the husband of the plaintiff, made an\r\n     exhaustive and unanswerable argument before Judge Jameson, but to\r\n     no purpose as far as the result of that case was concerned, as\r\n     the opinion of the court delivered January 12, 1872, which was\r\n     very lengthy,[362] denied the relator with costs.\r\n\r\n     In 1872, Norman T. Gassette, esq., clerk of the Circuit Court of\r\n     Cook county, and recorder of deeds, remembering the limited\r\n     number of industrial occupations open to women, and seeing no\r\n     reason why they could not perform the work of that office,\r\n     resolved to try the experiment. A room was fitted up for the\r\n     special use of women, a number of whom gladly accepted the\r\n     proffered positions and received the same pay per folio as that\r\n     earned by men. The experiment proved entirely satisfactory, Major\r\n     Brockway having officially testified in regard to woman's\r\n     especial fitness for the work.\r\n\r\n     There was an attempt this year to get a law licensing houses of\r\n     ill-fame in Chicago, and an immense petition was rolled up and\r\n     presented to the legislature by ladies who desired to defeat the\r\n     proposed enactment. They carried their point by as neat a flank\r\n     movement as Sherman ever executed. A quiet move to Springfield\r\n     with a petition signed by thousands of the best men and women of\r\n     the city, and our enemies found themselves checkmated before the\r\n     game had fairly begun.\r\n\r\n     February 13, 14, 1872, the State Association held its annual\r\n     meeting at Bloomington, with large and interested audiences.[363]\r\n     March 28 Mrs. Jane Graham Jones secured a hearing before the\r\n     legislature for Miss Anthony, who made one of her most convincing\r\n     arguments, and had in her audience nearly every member of that\r\n     body who voted for what was termed the Alta Hulett bill.\r\n\r\n     To Myra Bradwell and Alta C. Hulett belongs the credit of a long\r\n     and persevering struggle to open the legal profession to women.\r\n     The latter succeeded at last in slipping the bolt which had\r\n     barred woman from her right to practice law. We take the\r\n     following statement in regard to Miss Hulett's experience from\r\n     the \"Women of the Century\":\r\n\r\n          At the age of seventeen, Miss Alta Hulett entered the law\r\n          office of Mr. Lathrop, of Rockford, as a student, and after\r\n          a few months' study passed the required examination, and\r\n          sent her credentials to the Supreme Court, which, instead of\r\n          granting or refusing her plea for admission, ignored it\r\n          altogether. Myra Bradwell, the successful editor of the\r\n          _Legal News_, had just been denied admission. Her case,\r\n          stated in brief, is this: Mrs. Bradwell made application\r\n          for a license to practice law. The court refused it on the\r\n          ground of her being a married woman. She immediately brought\r\n          a suit to test the legality of this decision. This\r\n          interesting case was carried to the Supreme Court of the\r\n          United States, which sustained the decision of the lower\r\n          courts.[364] Miss Hulett had reason to expect that since she\r\n          was unmarried, this decision would not prejudice her case.\r\n          Just on the threshold of her chosen profession, the rewards\r\n          of youthful aspirations and earnest study apparently within\r\n          her grasp, her dismay may be imagined when no response\r\n          whatever was vouchsafed her petition. A fainter heart would\r\n          have accepted the situation. To battle successfully with old\r\n          prejudices, entrenched in the strongholds of the law,\r\n          required not only marked ability, but also a courage which\r\n          could not surrender. Miss Hulett took a country school for\r\n          four months, and bravely went to work again. While teaching\r\n          and \"boarding round,\" she prepared a lecture, \"Justice vs.\r\n          The Supreme Court,\" in which she vigorously and eloquently\r\n          stated her case. This lecture was delivered in Rockford,\r\n          Freeport, and many other towns, enlisting everywhere\r\n          sympathy and admiration in her behalf. After taking counsel\r\n          with Lieutenant-Governor Early and other prominent members\r\n          of the legislature, she drafted a bill, the provisions of\r\n          which are:\r\n\r\n          _Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois\r\n          represented in the General Assembly_, That no person shall\r\n          be precluded or debarred from any occupation, profession, or\r\n          employment (except military), on account of sex. Provided\r\n          this act shall not be construed to affect the eligibility of\r\n          any person to an elective office.\r\n\r\n          Nothing in this act shall be construed as requiring any\r\n          female to work on streets or roads, or serve on juries. All\r\n          laws inconsistent with this act are hereby repealed.\r\n\r\n          Friends obtained for this bill a very favorable introduction\r\n          into the legislature, where it passed and received the\r\n          Governor's signature. Passing up the steps to her home one\r\n          rainy day, the telegram announcing that the bill had become\r\n          a law was placed in her hands, and in referring to the\r\n          incident, Miss Hulett said: \"I shall never again know a\r\n          moment of such supreme happiness.\" We can only add in this\r\n          connection that after a most vigorous examination she stood\r\n          at the head of a class of twenty-eight, all the other\r\n          members being gentlemen. This time the Supreme Court made\r\n          the amende honorable, courteously and cordially welcoming\r\n          her into the ranks of the profession on her birthday, June\r\n          4, 1873, and at the age of nineteen Miss Hulett commenced\r\n          the practice of law.\r\n\r\n     But Miss Hulett's career, so full of promise, was soon ended. The\r\n     announcement of her untimely death, which occurred at San Diego,\r\n     Cal., March 26, 1877, sent a pang to the hearts of those who knew\r\n     her personally, and of thousands who regarded her with pride as a\r\n     representative woman. A Chicago correspondent says:\r\n\r\n          The daily press of the city have already borne ample\r\n          testimony to her professional talents and success and to the\r\n          esteem and admiration accorded her by the bar of Chicago and\r\n          by the general public; for her somewhat exceptional position\r\n          as well as her ability had made her one of the marked\r\n          characters of the city. Her short life, so successful and\r\n          brilliant to the public eye, was not without its dark and\r\n          thorny places. Unusual responsibilities of a domestic\r\n          nature, opposition of various kinds and keen disappointments\r\n          only nerved her to greater persistency, and her courage was\r\n          upheld by the generous and abundant recognition which she\r\n          received on every hand from leading members of the bar--a\r\n          recognition for which she never failed, when opportunity\r\n          offered, to express her sense of profound obligation--and\r\n          she was accustomed to say that the law was the most liberal\r\n          of the professions. Much as Miss Hulett had accomplished\r\n          hitherto, it was felt that she had only crossed the\r\n          threshold of a career of surpassing usefulness; all things\r\n          seemed possible to one so richly endowed; her mental vigor\r\n          seemed matched by a _physique_, the apparent type of\r\n          blooming health; but the seeds of disease were inherited and\r\n          only awaited a combination of circumstances to assert their\r\n          fatal power. Absorbing enthusiasm for her profession, and\r\n          the cares of a rapidly increasing practice, made her\r\n          overlook the insidious danger lurking in a cold, and not\r\n          until her alarmed physician ordered her to the soft climate\r\n          of Southern California did she comprehend her danger. This\r\n          peremptory order was a terrible shock, and the forced exile\r\n          from the field of her hopes and ambitions, more bitter than\r\n          death. She never rallied, but continued rapidly to fail\r\n          until the end came. At a meeting of the bar of Chicago, held\r\n          to take action in commemoration of the death of Miss Alta M.\r\n          Hulett, attorney-at-law, the following was one of the\r\n          resolutions adopted:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That although the legal profession has hitherto\r\n          been almost, if not altogether, considered as exclusively\r\n          for men to practice, yet we freely recognize Miss Hulett's\r\n          right to adopt it as her pursuit in life, and cheerfully\r\n          bear testimony to the fact that in her practice she never\r\n          demeaned herself in any way unbecoming a woman. She was\r\n          always true to her clients and their interests, but she was\r\n          equally true to her sex and her duty; and if women who now\r\n          are, or hereafter shall become, members of our profession\r\n          shall be equally true, its honor will never be tarnished,\r\n          nor the respect, good-will and esteem which it is the duty\r\n          and pride of man to accord to woman be in the least\r\n          diminished by their membership.\r\n\r\n          Which, translated, means that men are not only ready to\r\n          welcome into one of their own professions women having the\r\n          requisite intellectual qualifications, but that the welcome\r\n          will be the warmer if the women entering shall not leave\r\n          behind the more feminine attributes of the sex. Portia did\r\n          deliver judgment, but the counselor's cap became the pretty\r\n          locks it could not hide, and the jurist's cloak lent\r\n          additional grace to the symmetry and litheness of female\r\n          youth.\r\n\r\n     M. Fredrica Perry began the study of law in the office of Shipman\r\n     & Loveridge, Coldwater, Michigan, in the winter of 1870-71. She\r\n     spent two years in the law-office and then two years in the\r\n     law-school of Michigan University. On graduating from the\r\n     law-school in March, 1875, she was admitted to the Michigan bar.\r\n     She located in Chicago in August, and in September was admitted\r\n     to the Illinois bar and began practice. A few weeks later she\r\n     was, on motion of Miss Hulett, admitted to the U.S. Circuit and\r\n     District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois. She was in\r\n     partnership with Ellen A. Martin under the name of Perry &\r\n     Martin. Her death occured June 3, 1883, and was the result of\r\n     pneumonia. Miss Perry was a successful lawyer and combined in an\r\n     eminent degree the qualities which distinguish able barristers\r\n     and jurists; her mind was broad and catholic, clear, quick,\r\n     logical and profound; her information on legal and general\r\n     matters was extensive. She was an excellent advocate, a skillful\r\n     examiner of witnesses, and understood as few do, save\r\n     practitioners who have grown old in experience, the nice\r\n     discriminations of common-law pleading and the rules of evidence.\r\n     She was engrossed in the study and practice of law, and gained\r\n     steadily in efficiency and power year by year. She had the genius\r\n     and ability for the highest attainment in all branches of civil\r\n     practice, and joined with these the power of close application\r\n     and hard work. She belonged to the Strong family which has\r\n     furnished a good deal of the legal talent of the United States.\r\n     Judge Tuley, a chancery judge of Chicago before whom she often\r\n     appeared, said of her at the bar meeting called to take action\r\n     upon her death: \"I was surprised at the extent of her legal\r\n     knowledge and the great legal acumen she displayed.\" And of her\r\n     manner and method of conducting a certain bitterly-contested case\r\n     in his court: \"I became satisfied that the influence of woman\r\n     would be highly beneficial in preserving and sustaining that\r\n     high standard of professional courtesy which should always exist\r\n     among the members of our profession.\"----Ellen A. Martin, of\r\n     Perry & Martin, Chicago, spent two years in a law-office and two\r\n     years in Michigan University law-school, and was graduated and\r\n     admitted to practice in Michigan at the same time with Miss\r\n     Perry. She was admitted in Illinois in January, 1876, and since\r\n     then to the U. S. Circuit Court.----In the summer of 1879, Mrs.\r\n     M. B. R. Shay, Streator, graduating from the Bloomington\r\n     law-school, was admitted to the bar. She has published a book\r\n     entitled, \"Students Guide to Common-Law Pleading.\"----In 1880,\r\n     Cora A. Benneson, Quincy, was graduated from the Michigan\r\n     University law-school and admitted to the Michigan and Illinois\r\n     bar.----Ada H. Kepley, in practice with her husband at Effingham,\r\n     was graduated from the Chicago law-school in June, 1870, but was\r\n     refused admission to the bar. In November of that year, a motion\r\n     was made in the Court at Effingham that she should be allowed to\r\n     act as attorney in a case at that bar, and Judge Decius said that\r\n     though the Supreme Court had refused to license a woman, he yet\r\n     thought the motion was proper and in accord with the spirit of\r\n     the age and granted the motion. Mrs. Kepley was finally admitted,\r\n     January, 1881.----Miss Bessie Bradwell, graduated from the Union\r\n     College of Law of Chicago and admitted to the bar in 1882, is\r\n     associated with her parents, Judge and Mrs. Bradwell, on the\r\n     _Legal News_ and in the preparation of Bradwell's Appellate Court\r\n     Reports.\r\n\r\n     July 1, 1873, the bill making women eligible as school officers\r\n     became a law, and in the fall elections of the same year the\r\n     people gave unmistakable indorsement of the champions of the\r\n     bill, by electing women as superintendent of schools in ten\r\n     counties, while in sixteen others women were nominated. Many of\r\n     these earnest women have been in the service ever since. As the\r\n     practical results of woman's controlling influence as\r\n     superintendents of schools seems to epitomize her work in all\r\n     official positions, we submit a report compiled by Miss Mary\r\n     Allen West, made at the request of the Illinois Social Science\r\n     Association, regretting that we have not space for one of the\r\n     model reports of Miss Sarah Raymond, also for ten years\r\n     superintendent of the schools of Bloomington:\r\n\r\n          During the session of 1872-3, Judge Bradwell introduced into\r\n          the legislature the following bill, which became a law April\r\n          3, 1873: \"Be it enacted by the people of Illinois,\r\n          represented in General Assembly, that any woman, married or\r\n          single, of the age of twenty-one years and upwards, and\r\n          possessing the qualifications prescribed for men, shall be\r\n          eligible to any office under the general school laws of this\r\n          State.\" A second section provides for her giving bonds.\r\n\r\n          At the next election, November, 1873, ten ladies were\r\n          elected to the office of county superintendent of schools\r\n          for a term of four years. As this term has now expired, it\r\n          is a favorable time to inquire how women have succeeded in\r\n          this new line of labor. That the work that devolves upon\r\n          county superintendents may be understood, I give a part of\r\n          the synopsis of the duties pertaining to the office, as\r\n          enumerated by Dr. Newton Bateman:\r\n\r\n          _First_--She must carefully inspect and pass upon the bonds\r\n          of all township treasurers, and upon the securities given in\r\n          each case, and is personally liable as well upon her\r\n          official bond for any loss to the school funds sustained\r\n          through her neglect or careless performance of duty.\r\n\r\n          _Second_--She must keep herself fully and carefully informed\r\n          as to what townships have and what have not complied with\r\n          the provisions of the law in respect to maintenance of\r\n          schools; so that no funds may in ignorance be paid to\r\n          townships having no legal claim to them.\r\n\r\n          _Third_--She must collect, transcribe, classify, verify,\r\n          tabulate, and transmit annually to the State superintendent\r\n          the school statistics of her county, together with a\r\n          detailed written report of the condition of the common\r\n          schools therein.\r\n\r\n          _Fourth_--She must arrange, classify, file and preserve all\r\n          books, papers, bonds, official correspondence and other\r\n          documents belonging to her office.\r\n\r\n          _Fifth_--She must impart instruction and give directions to\r\n          inexperienced teachers in the science, art and method of\r\n          teaching, and must be ready, at all times, to counsel,\r\n          advise and assist the school officers of her county.\r\n\r\n          _Sixth_--She must take an active part in the management of\r\n          County Teachers' Institutes, and labor in every way to\r\n          improve the quality of teaching in her county.\r\n\r\n          _Seventh_--She must hear, examine, and determine all\r\n          questions and controversies under school law, which may be\r\n          referred to her, and must carefully prepare, to the best of\r\n          her knowledge and ability, such replies to all letters from\r\n          school officers and teachers as each case demands.\r\n\r\n          _Eighth_--She must examine all candidates desiring to teach\r\n          in her county, and grant certificates to such, and such\r\n          only, as she honestly thinks are of good moral character and\r\n          sufficient scholastic attainments. As no one can teach in a\r\n          public school without such certificate, this gives her the\r\n          veto power over all teachers. Dr. Bateman, commenting on\r\n          fourteen specifications, of which the foregoing constitute\r\n          but eight, says these are _some_ of the _many_ duties made\r\n          obligatory upon the county superintendent by law. Besides\r\n          all these, is the visitation of schools, which every true\r\n          superintendent considers a very important part of the work.\r\n\r\n          For convenience we will group these duties in three classes:\r\n          1. Those concerning finance. 2. Legal duties. 3. Duties to\r\n          teachers and schools.\r\n\r\n          I. To give an idea of the financial interests intrusted to\r\n          the hands of these women, we find by reference to the State\r\n          superintendent's report for last year that the total\r\n          receipts for school purposes in these ten counties which\r\n          they superintend was $1,009,441. So far as can be learned\r\n          from the records, not one cent of the large sums over which\r\n          they had supervision has been lost through their dishonesty,\r\n          or, what was more to be feared, their ignorance of business.\r\n          Unlike those of Dora Copperfield, their accounts _will_ \"add\r\n          up.\" In the county (Knox) where the receipts are greatest,\r\n          aggregating $182,423.22, the greatest difference between\r\n          receipts and expenditures, as shown by the superintendent's\r\n          books, is ten cents. In many of these counties the financial\r\n          affairs were in the greatest confusion when the ladies came\r\n          into office. In one, perhaps more, the preceding\r\n          superintendent was a defaulter, in another he was engaged in\r\n          a law-suit with the county board, and in still others\r\n          strange irregularities were discovered. In every instance,\r\n          so far as we can ascertain, these crookednesses have been\r\n          straightened out, the finances put upon a surer basis,\r\n          hundreds, we believe thousands, of dollars of bad debts have\r\n          been collected, treasurers and directors have been induced\r\n          to keep their books with greater care and in better shape,\r\n          reckless expenditure of school funds has been discouraged,\r\n          and directors encouraged to expend the money for things\r\n          which will permanently benefit the schools. So much for\r\n          finance.\r\n\r\n          II. _Legal Duties._--Rightly to discharge the duties imposed\r\n          by specification 7, the county superintendent needs to be a\r\n          very good lawyer, for school law in its ramifications\r\n          reaches many other departments of law. Especially is it\r\n          inextricably mixed up with election laws, and all know that\r\n          cases arising under election laws are among the most complex\r\n          and difficult to handle. Probably a school election never\r\n          occurrs in which some such cases are not referred to the\r\n          county superintendent. In the settlement of these and other\r\n          cases arising under school law, these women have been\r\n          peculiarly successful, and some of them have earned the\r\n          blessing bestowed upon the peacemakers. We know of one\r\n          county where, after last spring's election, five contested\r\n          cases were referred to the superintendent for settlement;\r\n          these were all satisfactorily adjusted by her. During her\r\n          four years' administration, scores of controversies were\r\n          referred to her, and there has never been a single appeal\r\n          from her decisions. Another most complicated case involving\r\n          a defaulting treasurer, was conducted entirely by the county\r\n          superintendent until it became necessary to employ a lawyer\r\n          to argue the case in court. What she had done was then\r\n          submitted to one of the leading lawyers of the State, and he\r\n          sanctioned and approved each step. Numerous other instances\r\n          might be cited to show that woman has not failed in the\r\n          legal part of her work as superintendent of schools.\r\n\r\n          III. _Her Work with Teachers and Schools._--Here our\r\n          superintendents were perfectly at home. Each of the ten had\r\n          taught successfully for years, and so knew the wants of the\r\n          school-room. This knowledge was invaluable, both in the\r\n          examination of teachers and in the supervision of schools.\r\n          Fears were expressed lest in the examination of candidates,\r\n          womanly sympathy would lead them to grant certificates to\r\n          needy applicants who were not altogether qualified. But the\r\n          motherliness which is in every true woman's heart, warded\r\n          off this danger. As one remarked, \"I have a great deal of\r\n          the milk of human kindness in my nature, but its streams\r\n          flow toward the roomful of children to be injured by an\r\n          incompetent teacher, rather than toward that teacher,\r\n          however needy he may be. If his claims rest on his needs\r\n          rather than his merits, let the poormaster attend to his\r\n          wants, not the superintendent. School money is not a pauper\r\n          fund.\" This motherliness comes in good play in school\r\n          visitation. It draws the children to the superintendent;\r\n          keeps them from being afraid of her, and hence leads them to\r\n          work naturally during her visit; thus she can obtain a true\r\n          idea of the status of the school, and know just how to\r\n          advise and direct the teacher. The same thing holds true in\r\n          regard to teachers; the majority of them are ladies, and\r\n          they will come to a lady for the solution of their doubts\r\n          and difficulties much more freely than to a gentleman. This\r\n          gives her better opportunity to \"impart instruction and give\r\n          directions to inexperienced teachers.\" Woman's power to lift\r\n          up the teachers under her control to a higher plane, both\r\n          intellectually and morally, has been signally demonstrated\r\n          by the experience of the past four years.\r\n\r\n          In looking after the details of official work, those\r\n          tiresome minutiae so often left at \"loose ends,\" producing\r\n          endless confusion, woman has shown great aptitude. You say,\r\n          \"this is but the clean sweeping of a new broom.\" May be so,\r\n          in part; but in part it comes from the womanly instinct to\r\n          \"look well to the ways of her household,\" whether that\r\n          household be the occupants of a cottage or the schools of a\r\n          county. In the work of the State Association of County\r\n          Superintendents, the ladies have well sustained their part.\r\n          When placed on the programme, they have come prepared with\r\n          carefully written papers, showing their desire to give the\r\n          Association the benefit of their best thoughts, and not put\r\n          off upon it such crudely digested ideas as may spring up at\r\n          the moment. At the last meeting at Springfield, four out of\r\n          the nine superintendents now in office were present, 44 per\r\n          cent.; out of the 93 gentlemen in the same office, 18 were\r\n          present, 19 per cent. The ratio of attendance has been about\r\n          the same for the four years.\r\n\r\n          How has woman's work as county superintendent impressed\r\n          other educators? State-Superintendent Etter, who confesses\r\n          that he was not in favor of the plan, said at the State\r\n          Teachers' Association, above referred to: \"The ladies\r\n          compare very favorably with their gentlemen co-laborers.\"\r\n          Mr. E.L. Wells, for twelve years county superintendent of\r\n          Ogle county, and thoroughly conversant with the work\r\n          throughout the State, concurs in this opinion. President\r\n          Newton Bateman, than whom no man in the State is better\r\n          fitted to speak on this subject, in his political-economy\r\n          class in Knox college, took occasion to commend the\r\n          efficiency of women as county superintendents of our State.\r\n          A gentleman who travels extensively, and looks into school\r\n          affairs closely, says he is convinced that in every county\r\n          where a woman was elected four years ago, the efficiency of\r\n          the office had been doubled and in some cases increased four\r\n          or even ten fold. If this be not an exaggeration, an\r\n          explanation may be found in the fact that in most of these\r\n          counties the best ladies were put in the place of gentlemen\r\n          most poorly fitted for the place. The office had become a\r\n          political foot-ball, kicked about as party exigencies\r\n          demanded, and often came into possession of political hacks\r\n          who \"must be provided for,\" and for whom no other place\r\n          could be found. They had no qualifications for the office,\r\n          and, of course, could not perform its duties. The people,\r\n          disgusted, turned to the women for relief, and took good\r\n          care to elect the ones best fitted to do the work. Had equal\r\n          care been used in the selection of their predecessors, they\r\n          might have done equally good work. In quoting opinions, I\r\n          have purposely confined myself to those given by gentlemen.\r\n\r\n          The limits of this paper have restricted this discussion to\r\n          the work of woman as a county superintendent; but in other\r\n          school offices she is doing efficient work. All over the\r\n          State we have examples of her efficiency as school director.\r\n          Miss Sarah E. Raymond, in Bloomington, and Miss Ludlow, in\r\n          Davenport (by the way, the Iowa State Teachers' Association\r\n          last year honored itself by electing her president),\r\n          abundantly proves woman's ability to superintend the schools\r\n          of large cities. M.A.W.\r\n\r\n     In _Zion's Herald_ 1873, on the origin of the Woman's College in\r\n     Evanston, Miss Frances E. Willard writes:\r\n\r\n          In 1866, when we were all tugging away to build Heck Hall\r\n          for ministers, I heard several thoughtful women say, \"We\r\n          ought to be doing this for our own sex. Men have help from\r\n          every side, while no one thinks of women.\" In the summer of\r\n          1868 Mrs. Mary F. Haskins, who had been treasurer of the\r\n          American Methodist Ladies' Centenary Association, which\r\n          built Heck Hall, raising for the purpose $50,000, invited\r\n          the ladies of Evanston to her home to talk over the subject\r\n          of founding a Woman's College, which should secure to young\r\n          women the highest educational advantages. Mrs. Haskin\r\n          originated the thought--with her own hands assisted in\r\n          laying the corner-stone, and in her first address as\r\n          president she said: \"I have often thought that to the\r\n          successful teacher the words must be full of hope and\r\n          promise, which a great writer uses of education: 'It is a\r\n          companion which no misfortune can distress, no crime\r\n          destroy, no enemy alienate, no despot enslave; at home a\r\n          friend, abroad an introduction; in solitude a solace, in\r\n          society an ornament. It chastens vice, it guides virtue, it\r\n          adds a grace to genius. Without it what is man?'--and I\r\n          would add with emphasis, Without an education, what is\r\n          woman?\"\r\n\r\n     This Woman's College at Evanston is the first on record to which\r\n     a charter, granting full collegiate powers, was ever given by\r\n     legislative act, including only names of women in its board of\r\n     trustees. This board, elected Miss Frances E. Willard president,\r\n     who presided over the institution for two years, during which\r\n     term a class of young women was graduated, the first in history\r\n     to whom diplomas were voted and conferred by women. The degree of\r\n     A. M. was given Mrs. Jennie Fowler Willing, of Chicago, who\r\n     preached the baccalaureate sermon at the unique commencement\r\n     exercises. Mrs. Mary F. Haskin, and Mrs. Elizabeth Greenleaf were\r\n     respectively presidents of the board of trustees.\r\n\r\n     Later on, as a higher evolution of the central thought, an\r\n     arrangement was made between the Woman's College and the\r\n     Northwestern University, by which the former became the woman's\r\n     department of the latter, on condition that in its board of\r\n     trustees, faculty of instruction, and all its departments of\r\n     culture, women should be admitted on an equality with men, as to\r\n     opportunities, positions and salaries. Miss Willard was then\r\n     chosen dean of the Woman's College, and professor of aesthetics in\r\n     the University. Mrs. Emily Huntington Miller was placed on the\r\n     executive committee of the board, and Mrs. R. F. Queal, Mrs.\r\n     Jennie Fowler Willing, Mrs. Mary Bannister Willard, and Mrs. L.\r\n     L. Greenleaf were elected trustees. One year later, Miss Willard\r\n     entered the temperance work since which time Miss Ellen M. Soule\r\n     and Miss Jane Bancroft have successively served in the position\r\n     of dean.\r\n\r\n     The young women have led in scholarship, taken prizes in\r\n     composition and oratory, while upon one occasion the delighted\r\n     students dragged forth the only artillery in the village to voice\r\n     their enthusiasm over the fact that to Miss Lizzie R. Hunt had\r\n     been awarded at the great international contest the first prize\r\n     for the best English essay.\r\n\r\n     In 1873, while filling the duties of professor in Wesleyan\r\n     University, Mrs. Jennie Fowler Willing was licensed as a local\r\n     preacher in the Methodist Episcopal Church, the first woman\r\n     engaged as evangelist in Illinois.\r\n\r\n     The Monticello Ladies' Seminary at Godfrey is worthy of mention.\r\n     Miss Harriet N. Haskell, its president, has done a noble work\r\n     there in making possible for many girls, by labor under her roof\r\n     to pay in part for a liberal education. She has been at the head\r\n     of this institution for thirty years. Mrs. F.A. Shiner at Mt.\r\n     Carroll, is another grand woman worthy of mention. She, too,\r\n     gives poor girls an opportunity in her household to pay in part\r\n     for their education. In this way many are being trained in\r\n     domestic accomplishments as well as the higher branches of\r\n     education. There is no distinction made between those who work a\r\n     certain number of hours each day and those who pay in full for\r\n     their advantages; and in many cases the best scholars have been\r\n     found from year to year among those who had the stimulus of\r\n     labor. As Miss Haskell and Mrs. Shiner have uniformly entertained\r\n     all the lyceum lecturers[365] at their beautiful homes, many have\r\n     had the pleasure of seeing and talking with these bright girls,\r\n     and the worthy presidents of the institutions.\r\n\r\n     We believe to Illinois belongs the distinction of being the\r\n     birthplace of the first woman admitted to the American Medical\r\n     Association--Dr. Sarah Hackett Stevenson, born at Buffalo Grove,\r\n     Ogle county. Dr. Stevenson was admitted to this time-honored\r\n     association June, 1876. The Philadelphia _Evening Bulletin_ thus\r\n     refers to the innovation:\r\n\r\n          The doctors have combined millennial with centennial\r\n          glories. The largest assemblage of the medical profession\r\n          ever held in America yesterday honored itself by bursting\r\n          the bonds of ancient prejudice, and admitting a woman to its\r\n          membership by a vote that proved the battle won, and that\r\n          henceforth professional qualification, and not sex, is to be\r\n          the test of standing in the medical world. Looking over the\r\n          past fierce resistance by which every advance of woman into\r\n          the field of medical life was met, yesterday's action seems\r\n          like the opening of a scientific millennium. It was a most\r\n          appropriate time and place for the beginning of this new era\r\n          of medical righteousness and peace. Here, in the centennial\r\n          year, in the \"City of Brotherly Love,\" where the first\r\n          organized effort for the medical education of women was\r\n          made, where the oldest medical college for women in the\r\n          world is located, and where the fight against woman's entry\r\n          into the medical profession was most hotly waged, was the\r\n          place to take the manly new departure, which, so far as the\r\n          National Association is concerned, began yesterday in the\r\n          election of Dr. Sarah Hackett Stevenson as a member in full\r\n          standing from the State of Illinois.\r\n\r\n     Dr. Mary H. Thompson, who was graduated at Boston in 1863, and\r\n     who, removing to Chicago, succeeded in establishing a woman's\r\n     hospital, is included in a short list of notable alumnae of the\r\n     Boston Medical School. Dr. Lelia G. Bedell, Dr. E. G. Cook, Dr.\r\n     Julia Holmes Smith, Dr. Alice B. Stockham, and many others have\r\n     won honorable distinction in this profession.\r\n\r\n     One of the marked crises in the history of the reform we trace\r\n     was the centennial Fourth of July. The daughters of the Pilgrims\r\n     realized as never before the cruel injustice by which they were\r\n     deprived of their birthright, and from the Western prairies and\r\n     Eastern hills their earnest protest was given to the nation. As\r\n     early as May 2, 1876, at a special convention of the Illinois\r\n     Woman Suffrage Association, two vigorous protests were read as\r\n     the official utterances of State and National Associations. The\r\n     convention was called to order by Mrs. Alma Van Winkle, who\r\n     stated that Mrs. Jane Graham Jones,[366] the beloved and\r\n     efficient president of the association, having determined upon a\r\n     European sojourn, had sent her resignation to the executive\r\n     committee, and that Mrs. Elizabeth Boynton Harbert, recently\r\n     removed to the State, had been elected to fill her place. This\r\n     action being ratified, Susan B. Anthony was introduced, and\r\n     although she had just concluded an intensely vigorous lyceum\r\n     tour, extending through many months, she spoke with unusual\r\n     power. Just here I wish to emphasize the great loss to women in\r\n     the fact that as Miss Anthony's speeches were never written, but\r\n     came with thrilling effect from her patriotic soul, scarce any\r\n     record of them remains, other than the intangible memories of her\r\n     grateful countrywomen. At this convention the following address\r\n     was read and adopted:\r\n\r\n          _To the Women of the United States of America, greeting:_\r\n\r\n          While the centennial clock is striking the hour of\r\n          opportunity for the Pilgrims' daughters to prove themselves\r\n          regenerate children of a worthy ancestry, while the air\r\n          reverberates to the watchwords of the statesmen of the\r\n          Revolution, let the daughters of the nation, in clear,\r\n          steady and womanly voices, chorus through the States:\r\n          \"Taxation without representation is tyranny,\" and \"all\r\n          governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\r\n          governed.\"\r\n\r\n          Womanly hands, firm, capable and loving, have been steadily,\r\n          persistently and unceasingly knocking, knocking at the doors\r\n          of judicial, ecclesiastical and legislative halls, until at\r\n          last the rusty bars are yielding and the persistent knocking\r\n          is beginning to tell upon iron nerves and all kinds of\r\n          masculine constitutions. Just now, in the centennial year,\r\n          another door has opened, preparing the way for the Pilgrims'\r\n          daughters to present their claim before the assembled nation\r\n          on the \"Fourth of July, 1876.\"\r\n\r\n          A joint resolution of congress, signed by the president of\r\n          the United States, and made the subject of proclamation by\r\n          the governor of the State, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n          _Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives\r\n          of the United States of America_, That it be, and is hereby,\r\n          recommended by the Senate and the House of Representatives\r\n          to the people of the several States, that they assemble in\r\n          the several counties and towns on the approaching centennial\r\n          anniversary of our national independence, and that they\r\n          cause to have delivered on such day an historical sketch of\r\n          said county or town from its foundation, and that a copy of\r\n          said sketch may be filed, in print or manuscript, in the\r\n          clerk's office of said county, and an additional copy be\r\n          filed in the office of the librarian of congress at the city\r\n          of Washington, to the intent that a complete record may thus\r\n          be obtained of the progress of our institutions during the\r\n          first centennial of their existence.\r\n\r\n          The governor of this State earnestly recommends that prompt\r\n          measures be taken in each county and town for the selection\r\n          of one or more persons who shall prepare complete, thorough\r\n          and accurate historical sketches of each county, city, town\r\n          or village, from the date of the settlement to the present\r\n          time.\r\n\r\n          In view of the fact that since our civil war thousands of\r\n          charitable, scientific, philanthropic, religious and\r\n          political associations have been organized among women, of\r\n          which but few accurate records are now accessible to the\r\n          general public, and in view of the fact that the Supreme\r\n          Court and many of our legislators construe \"persons\" to\r\n          indicate only men (except when persons are to be taxed,\r\n          fined or executed), we respectfully suggest that in all\r\n          cases one member of the committee shall be a woman, to the\r\n          end that there may be submitted to future historians\r\n          accurate data of the extent and scope of the work of\r\n          American women; that this historian of woman shall carefully\r\n          and impartially record the literary, educational,\r\n          journalistic, industrial, charitable and political work of\r\n          woman as expressed in temperance, missionary and woman\r\n          suffrage organization.\r\n\r\n          Let a meeting of every woman suffrage organization\r\n          throughout the State, or, where none exists, let any friend\r\n          of the cause call a meeting, at which a committee shall be\r\n          appointed to present this suggestion to the people as they\r\n          may meet in the different cities, villages and towns, to\r\n          perfect arrangements for their local celebration.\r\n\r\n          As American citizens we salute the tri-color, emblem of the\r\n          rights obtained and liberties won by husbands, fathers and\r\n          sons, meanwhile pledging, if need be, another century of\r\n          toil and effort to the sacred cause of human rights, and the\r\n          establishment of a genuine republic.\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH BOYNTON HARBERT,\r\n                                  _Pres. Ill. Woman Suffrage Society._\r\n\r\n     It was decided at this convention to celebrate the Fourth of July\r\n     in some appropriate manner. Under the auspices of Mrs. Harbert\r\n     this was done at Evanston. The occasion was heralded as \"The\r\n     Woman's Fourth,\" and programmes[367] were scattered through the\r\n     village.\r\n\r\n     The auditorium of the large Methodist Church was tastefully\r\n     decorated with exquisite flowers; flags were gracefully festooned\r\n     about the pulpit, and all the appointments were pronounced\r\n     artistic by the most critical, and Mrs. Harbert's oration, of\r\n     which we give a few extracts, aimed to be in keeping with her\r\n     surroundings:\r\n\r\n          If possessed of artistic genius, I would seize the pencil\r\n          and imprison in rich and gorgeous coloring two pictures for\r\n          the woman's pavilion of our centennial; for the first I\r\n          would reproduce that prophetically symbolic scene at the\r\n          dawn of our history, when with a faith and generosity worthy\r\n          of honorable mention, Isabella of Castile placed her jewels\r\n          in the almost discouraged mariner's hands, and bade Columbus\r\n          give to the world Columbia. The second scene would be the\r\n          antithesis of the first, as to-day, the women of the United\r\n          States make haste to lay at the feet of our statesmen and\r\n          prophets their jewels of thought and influence, bidding\r\n          them, in the name of woman, give to the world a perfected\r\n          government, a genuine republic, a purer civilization. Now,\r\n          as then, there are many ready with mocking jeers; but,\r\n          turning not to the right nor the left, the faith of woman\r\n          and the courage of man move on apace to sure success. That\r\n          historic \"first gun\" not only jarred loose every rivet in\r\n          the manacles of 4,000,000 slaves, but when the smoke of the\r\n          cannonading had lifted, the entire horizon of woman was\r\n          broadened, illuminated, glorified. On that April day when a\r\n          nation of citizens were suddenly transformed into an army of\r\n          warriors, American women, with a patriotism as intense as\r\n          theirs, a consecration as true, quietly assumed their\r\n          vacated places and became citizens. Out from market-place\r\n          and forum, counting-house and farm--keeping time to the\r\n          chime of the music of the Union--marched father, husband and\r\n          son; into office, store and farm, called there by no\r\n          ambitious desire to wander out of their sphere, but by the\r\n          same dire military necessity that called our men to the\r\n          front stepped orphaned daughter and widowed wife. Anna\r\n          Dickinson captured the lyceum and platform. The almost\r\n          classic scene of \"Corinne at the Capitol\" is not more\r\n          remarkable than that historic scene of the Quaker girl at\r\n          Washington, called there to receive the plaudits of the\r\n          highest officials of our nation, for services rendered in\r\n          the then vital political campaigns of New Hampshire,\r\n          Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New York.\r\n\r\n          The cruel, scarlet days of war dragged wearily on. Up from\r\n          the Southern battle-fields, borne northward in the lull of\r\n          the war tempest, came a wailing appeal from \"the boys,\" who\r\n          hitherto had never appealed to \"mother\" in vain: \"We are\r\n          wounded, sick and starving.\" Instantly the mother-heart\r\n          responded--waiting not for \"orders,\" snapping official\r\n          red-tape, as though it had been woven of cob-webs, two women\r\n          started southward with the needed supplies, and this great,\r\n          anxious, agonized North gave a sob of relief when the\r\n          message thrilled through the land that Jane C. Hoge and Mary\r\n          A. Livermore had arrived at the front with the needed\r\n          supplies. Idle, helpless, dependent queens were not then in\r\n          demand, but women fitted to be wives of heroes. Because our\r\n          lake-bordered, tree-fringed village was once her home, I\r\n          lovingly trace first on Evanston's scroll of honor the name\r\n          of Jane C. Hoge, while just underneath it I write that of\r\n          our venerable philanthropist, who was the first woman in\r\n          these United States to receive the badge of the Christian\r\n          commission, Mrs. Arza Brown.\r\n\r\n          And now, standing here upon the border-land of two\r\n          centuries, over-shadowed by the dear old flag, re-baptized\r\n          with the blood of my beloved as of yours--standing here, a\r\n          native-born citizen, as a woman to whom the honor, purity,\r\n          peace and freedom of native land is dear as life; as a wife\r\n          vitally interested in the interests of manhood; as a mother\r\n          responsible for the best development of her children; as a\r\n          human being, responsible to her Creator for the highest\r\n          possible usefulness, I claim equality before the law.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Mary Bannister Willard gave some surprising facts in regard\r\n     to woman's work in connection with the North Western University,\r\n     and reminded us that foremost among the women of the dawning\r\n     century was Eliza Garret of Chicago, who secured to the Garret\r\n     Biblical Institute its endowment of a quarter of a million of\r\n     dollars, with the proviso that a certain increase of income from\r\n     the same after the wants of the young theologues had been met,\r\n     should be applied to the erection and endowment of a seminary for\r\n     young ladies. But alas! the theological appetite has been\r\n     insatiate, even unto this last, and deliverance has come to our\r\n     girls from another quarter. And this was the throwing down of\r\n     university gates and bars, and a free extension of all\r\n     educational privileges to women. Upon the roll of honor\r\n     connected with this work we gratefully place the names of many\r\n     brave, self-sacrificing women.[368]\r\n\r\n     The Rev. Mr. Chappell, pastor of the Baptist church, then gave a\r\n     most eloquent, liberal oration. In closing, he said: \"But what\r\n     think you, sisters, of the dangers that threaten the republic? Do\r\n     they lie on your hearts? Are they in your prayers? Do they enter\r\n     into your plans? All compliments and gallantries aside, it makes\r\n     a vast difference in the destiny of the republic whether you\r\n     understand and feel its dangers. The scale has turned. No longer\r\n     need we dread oppression, disability, power; but on the other\r\n     hand, license, luxury, listlessness, forgetfulness of God and the\r\n     wholesome truth. This watch-night of the republic augurs well.\r\n     This gathering of the sisterhood has its meaning. You are the\r\n     power behind the throne; with you and with God lies the destiny\r\n     of the republic.\" After the benediction the audience dispersed,\r\n     all expressing of the entire programme the most enthusiastic\r\n     approval.\r\n\r\n     About the close of the year 1876, a noticeable change in the\r\n     direction of thought and effort was very apparent in the State of\r\n     Illinois. As a result of the ravages of the fire and the severe\r\n     mental strain to which business men were subjected, women sprang\r\n     to the rescue, and actively engaged in business. These additional\r\n     burdens assumed by the many, the few were left to bear the weight\r\n     of religious, philanthropic and social duties. Women had tested\r\n     their powers sufficiently to realize their strength, and were\r\n     impatient for immediate results, hence many of the active friends\r\n     of woman suffrage, believing that the temperance ballot could be\r\n     more speedily secured than entire political equality, joined the\r\n     home-protection movement, while through the broadening and\r\n     helpful influence of the Grange in the farm-homes of the\r\n     northwest, requests for aids to organization came from all\r\n     quarters. In order that the earnest thoughts of the one class and\r\n     the practical methods of the other, might be rendered mutually\r\n     beneficial, I one day entered the sanctum of the progressive\r\n     editor of the _Inter-Ocean_, and asked for a ten-minute audience.\r\n     The request was granted, and Wm. Penn Nixon, esq., courteously\r\n     listened to the following questions: \"As a progressive\r\n     journalist, and one who must recognize the philanthropic activity\r\n     of the women of the Northwest, has it ever occurred to you that\r\n     there is nowhere in journalism a special recognition of their\r\n     interests? We have special fashion departments, special cooking\r\n     departments, but no niche or corner devoted to the moral,\r\n     industrial, educational, philanthropic and political interests of\r\n     women; and does not your judgment assure you that such a\r\n     department could be rendered popular?\" As a result of this\r\n     conversation a special corner of the _Inter-Ocean_ was yielded to\r\n     woman's interests, designated by the editors, \"Woman's Kingdom,\"\r\n     and on January 6, 1877, the following announcement appeared:\r\n\r\n          Congratulations to women that we have at last found a home\r\n          in journalism; that amid the clashing of sabers of our\r\n          modern press tournament, the knights of the quill recognize\r\n          that women have some rights that journalists are bound to\r\n          respect. These columns are in the interest of no class,\r\n          clique, sect, or section, and we earnestly request accurate\r\n          data of woman's work. All missionary, literary, temperance\r\n          and woman suffrage organizations, will be accorded space for\r\n          announcing their aims. With an occasional review of new\r\n          books, we will confer in regard to what woman has written;\r\n          wandering through studios and sanctums, we will record what\r\n          she is painting and preaching. Pleading an intense and\r\n          loving interest in the splendid opportunities now opening to\r\n          American women, we shall hope that some truth may be evolved\r\n          that may enrich their lives.\r\n\r\n     Notwithstanding this was the first special department of the\r\n     kind, much of the best journalistic work of the State was being\r\n     done by women,[369] who seemed to have received a new baptism to\r\n     serve the higher interests of humanity. From the desire for\r\n     cooeperation expressed by many contributors to \"Woman's Kingdom,\"\r\n     the following little item was set afloat in May, 1877:\r\n\r\n          Many facts recently arresting attention, in connection with\r\n          the industrial, political, and moral interests of women,\r\n          seem to render a conference of their representatives in\r\n          regard to business aims, expedient. There is need of a\r\n          bureau through which the industrial interests of women can\r\n          be promoted and some practical answer given to the question\r\n          everywhere heard, \"How can we earn a living?\" There is a\r\n          demand for an educational bureau of correspondence and also\r\n          a lyceum bureau through whose agency good lectures upon\r\n          practical subjects can be secured in every city and village.\r\n          All interested in such a conference are requested to send\r\n          their names to Mrs. Elizabeth Boynton Harbert, Evanston,\r\n          Ill., or Mrs. Louise Rockwood Wardner, Cairo, Ill.\r\n\r\n     Hon. Frank Sanborn, in his annual report to the American Social\r\n     Science Association, mentioned the formation of a branch\r\n     society[370] in this State. He said:\r\n\r\n          Like the State Charities Aid Association of New York, which\r\n          was organized and is directed by women, the Illinois\r\n          Association devotes itself chiefly to practical applications\r\n          of social science, though in a somewhat different direction.\r\n          It was formed in October, 1877, with a membership of some\r\n          two hundred women; it publishes a monthly newspaper, _The\r\n          Illinois Social Science Journal_, full of interesting\r\n          communications, and it has organized in its first seven\r\n          months' existence eight smaller associations in other\r\n          States.\r\n\r\n     The enthusiasm in this society branching out in so many practical\r\n     directions, absorbed for a time the energies of the Illinois\r\n     women. Our membership reached 400. This may account for the\r\n     apparent lethargy of the Suffrage Association during the years of\r\n     1877-78. Caroline F. Corbin dealt an effective blow in her\r\n     novel, entitled \"Rebecca; or, A Woman's Secret.\" Jane Grey\r\n     Swisshelm, with trenchant pen, wrote earnest strictures against\r\n     the shams of society. Elizabeth Holt Babbitt wrote earnestly for\r\n     all reform movements. Myra Bradwell persistently held up to the\r\n     view of the legislators of the State the injustice of the laws\r\n     for woman. Mrs. Julia Mills Dunn and Mrs. Hannah J. Coffee were\r\n     doing quiet but most effective work in Henry county. Miss Eliza\r\n     Bowman was consecrating her young womanhood to the care of the\r\n     Foundlings' Home. Mrs. Wardner, Mrs. Candee, Mrs. George, and\r\n     other women in the southern part of the State, were founding the\r\n     library at Cairo, while in every village and hamlet clubs for\r\n     study or philanthropic work were being organized. Mrs. Kate N.\r\n     Doggett, as president of the Association for the advancement of\r\n     Women, was lending her influence to the formation of art clubs.\r\n     And all this in addition to the vast army of faithful teachers,\r\n     represented by Sarah B. Raymond, Professor Louisa Allen Gregory\r\n     and Mary C. Larned. Mrs. Louise Rockwood Wardner, president of\r\n     the Illinois Industrial School for Girls, and the noble band of\r\n     women associated with her, were earnestly at work in the endeavor\r\n     to secure to the vagrant girls of the State an industrial\r\n     education. Miss Frances E. Willard and the dauntless army of\r\n     temperance workers were petitioning for the right to vote on all\r\n     questions pertaining to the liquor traffic.\r\n\r\n     Meanwhile many of the members of the Illinois Social Science\r\n     Association were beginning to realize that every measure proposed\r\n     for progressive action was thwarted because of woman's inability\r\n     to crystallize her opinions into law. This has been the uniform\r\n     experience in every department of reform, and sooner or later all\r\n     thinking women see plainly that the direct influence secured by\r\n     political power gives weight and dignity to their words and\r\n     wishes. Mrs. Jane Graham Jones, ex-president of the State\r\n     Association, continued her effective work in Europe, and, as a\r\n     delegate from the National Association, prepared the following\r\n     address of welcome to the International Congress, convened in\r\n     Paris, July 5, 1878:\r\n\r\n          Friends, compatriots, and confreres of the International\r\n          Congress assembled to discuss the rights of women: Allow me\r\n          to extend to you the congratulations of the National Woman\r\n          Suffrage Association of America, which I have the honor to\r\n          represent. I congratulate you upon this important, this\r\n          sublime moment, this auspicious place for the meeting of a\r\n          woman's congress. Paris, gorgeous under the grand monarch\r\n          who surrounded his royal person with a splendid galaxy of\r\n          beauty, genius, and chivalry; attractive and influential\r\n          under the great emperor whose meteoric genius held\r\n          spell-bound the wondering gaze of a world; to-day, with\r\n          neither king nor court, nor man of destiny, is grander, more\r\n          gorgeous, more beautiful and more influential than ever\r\n          before. To-day this is the shrine toward which the pilgrims\r\n          from every land turn their impatient steps.\r\n\r\n          Each balmy breeze comes to us heavily laden with the\r\n          dialects of all nations. Not only are the different parts\r\n          represented in their economic and industrial products, but\r\n          each thought, idea, motive and need is brought before the\r\n          world in the various congresses assembled during this great\r\n          union festival of liberty, peace and labor. Literature,\r\n          science, religion, education, philosophy, and labor, each\r\n          has had its eloquent advocates. At this time, when the great\r\n          ones of the earth are met together in earnest thought and\r\n          honest discussion, when each mind and conscience is attuned\r\n          to the highest motive, how appropriate that woman, whose\r\n          labor, wealth and brain have cemented the stones in every\r\n          monument that man has reared to himself; that woman, the\r\n          oppressed, woman, the hater of wars, the faithful, quiet\r\n          drudge of the centuries, watching while others slept,\r\n          working while others plundered and murdered; woman, who has\r\n          died in prison and on the scaffold for liberty, should here\r\n          and now have her audience and her advocates.\r\n\r\n          As a child of America I love and venerate France. We cannot\r\n          forget LaFayette, although a hundred years have passed since\r\n          generous France sent him to our aid in our great struggle\r\n          for freedom. But as a woman I glory in her. [Great and\r\n          deafening applause.] All true women love and honor France.\r\n          [At this point the reader was interrupted with wild cries of\r\n          \"Bravo! bravo!\" \"Live America!\" \"True, true.\"] France, in\r\n          whose prolific soil great and progressive ideas generate and\r\n          take root, in spite of king, emperor, priest or tyrant;\r\n          France, the protectress of science, art, and philosophy;\r\n          France, the home of the scholar and thinker; France, the\r\n          asylum which generously received the women who came hither\r\n          seeking those intellectual advantages and privileges cruelly\r\n          denied them at home; France, that compelled republican\r\n          America and civilized England to open their educational\r\n          institutions to women; France, the birth-place of a host of\r\n          women whose splendid genius, devoted lives, and heroic\r\n          deaths have encouraged and inspired women of other lands in\r\n          their struggles to strike off the ignominious shackles which\r\n          the ages have riveted upon them! [Loud applause.] How\r\n          apropos it is, then, that the women from all nations meet on\r\n          the free soil of France to give to the world their\r\n          declaration of rights. To-day we clasp hands and pledge\r\n          hearts to the sacred cause of woman's emancipation. To-day\r\n          we meet to thank France for the grand women whose lofty\r\n          utterances come echoing and reechoing to us through the\r\n          corridors of time, and to thank her for her great men who\r\n          have been the beacon lights to guide the world to higher\r\n          civilization and greater hatred of oppression. In the name\r\n          of my great countrywomen, inaugurators and leaders of the\r\n          woman's rights movement in America, the eloquent and ardent\r\n          advocates of liberty for men and women alike, both black and\r\n          white; in the name of the officers of the National Woman\r\n          Suffrage Association; in the name of those grand women,\r\n          Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony,\r\n          I salute the women of France and of the world assembled in\r\n          this congress, and bid them god-speed. When we call to mind\r\n          what has been accomplished by noble women everywhere, we are\r\n          encouraged to renewed effort.\r\n\r\n          In America we have accomplished wonders, and yet we demand\r\n          more; and shall continue to demand until we are equal in the\r\n          state, in the church, and in the home. Twenty years ago\r\n          woman entered our courts of law only as a criminal to be\r\n          tried; now she enters as an advocate to plead the cause of\r\n          justice, and invoke the spirit of mercy. Twenty years ago\r\n          woman entered the sick room only as the poorly-paid nurse;\r\n          now she is the trusted medical adviser, friend and\r\n          counsellor. To-day she is in many respects the peer of man,\r\n          to-morrow she will be in all respects his acknowledged\r\n          equal. [Great and continued applause.]\r\n\r\n          Who can measure the influence this congress may have on\r\n          woman's advancement toward that perfect equality which\r\n          justice and humanity demand. Women of France and of the\r\n          world, be of good cheer, and continue to agitate for the\r\n          right, for in the elevation of woman lies the progress of\r\n          the world. [Deafening applause, and cries of hear, hear.]\r\n\r\n     A letter to the Chicago _Times_ commenting upon the above address\r\n     says:\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Jones being indisposed, was replaced momentarily by her\r\n          daughter, a beautiful young lady of about sixteen summers,\r\n          who read the opening address of her mother; her rich voice\r\n          pronouncing with such distinctness and beauty, the earnest\r\n          words, translated into French, won all hearts, and gave to\r\n          the opening of the congress such a prestige as it would\r\n          otherwise never have had. After its close, Miss Jones\r\n          regained her seat amidst the hearty congratulations of the\r\n          throng assembled in that great hall, and I was proud of our\r\n          little American. Her beauty and courage, coupled with her\r\n          extreme youth, were the principal topics discussed during\r\n          the day by outsiders. I was thankful that our nation was so\r\n          well represented at the very first meeting, and the Parisian\r\n          journals were all loud in their praise of Mrs. Jones'\r\n          welcoming address, as well as the charming apparition of her\r\n          young and accomplished daughter.\r\n\r\n     As indicating the numerous lines along which woman's aroused\r\n     energies have found expression, we would call attention to the\r\n     Art Union of central Illinois. It is composed of nine societies,\r\n     \"The Historical,\" and \"The Palladium,\" of Bloomington; the art\r\n     class at Decatur; \"Art Society,\" of Lincoln; \"Art Association,\"\r\n     of Jacksonville; \"Art Society,\" of Peoria; \"Art Society,\" of\r\n     Springfield, and \"Art Club,\" of Champagne. Mrs. Lavilla Wyatt\r\n     Latham, wife of Col. Robert G. Latham, of Lincoln, was the\r\n     originator of the Art Union. Their spacious home, built with\r\n     large piazzas in true southern style, is a museum of curiosities.\r\n     Its library, cabinet, pictures, and statuary, make it a most\r\n     attractive harbor of rest to the wandering band of lecturers,\r\n     especially as the cultivated host and hostess are in warm\r\n     sympathy with all reform movements. Mr. Latham was a warm friend\r\n     of Abraham Lincoln, and entertained him many times under his\r\n     roof.\r\n\r\n     The _Woman's Journal_ of March 24, 1877, said:\r\n\r\n          Seventy women of Illinois, appointed by the Woman's State\r\n          Temperance Union, went to the legislature, bearing a\r\n          petition signed by 7,000 persons, asking that no licenses to\r\n          sell liquor be granted, which are not asked for by a\r\n          majority of the citizens of the place.\r\n\r\n          Mr. SHERMAN moved a suspension of the rules to admit of the\r\n          presentation of the petition.\r\n\r\n          Mr. MERRITT objected, but, by a decided vote, the rules were\r\n          suspended, and the petition was received and read.\r\n\r\n          Mr. SHERMAN moved that Mrs. Prof. S. M. D. Fry of Wesleyan\r\n          University of Bloomington, be invited to address the House\r\n          upon the subject of the petition.\r\n\r\n          Mr. HERRINGTON objected to the obtrusion of such trifling\r\n          matter upon the House, which had business to do. It was well\r\n          enough to let the petition be received, but he wanted nobody\r\n          to be allowed to interfere with the business of the House.\r\n          Referring to some forty or fifty ladies of the Union who had\r\n          been admitted to the floor of the House, he wanted to know\r\n          by what authority persons not entitled to the privilege of\r\n          the floor had been admitted. He insisted on his prerogative\r\n          as a member, and asked that the floor and lobbies be cleared\r\n          of all persons not entitled to the privilege of the House.\r\n\r\n          According to the Chicago _Tribune_, this speech of\r\n          Herrington created a slight sensation, among the ladies\r\n          especially, but Mr. Herrington's demand was ignored, and a\r\n          recess of thirty minutes was taken to allow Mrs. Fry to\r\n          address the House in support of the petition, which she did\r\n          in a speech put in very telling phrases. At its conclusion,\r\n          some of the members opposed to temperance legislation,\r\n          signalized their ill-breeding, to say the least, by derisive\r\n          yells for Mr. Herrington and others to answer Mrs. Fry.\r\n          Presently the hall was resonant with yells and cheers,\r\n          converting it into a a very babel, and the hubbub was kept\r\n          up until, at the expiration of the half-hour recess, Speaker\r\n          Shaw called \"order\" and the House immediately adjourned.\r\n\r\n          If any body of men bearing a petition of 7,000 voting men,\r\n          had gone to the same legislature, and by courtesy been\r\n          admitted to speak for their petition, no member would have\r\n          dared to insult them. It is because they had no recognized\r\n          political rights that these women were insulted. Claim your\r\n          right, ladies, to be equal members of the legislature, then\r\n          you can enact temperance laws, and have an unquestioned\r\n          right \"to the privilege of the floor.\"\r\n\r\n     In 1879, under the lead of their president, Frances E. Willard,\r\n     the women of Illinois rolled up a mammoth petition of 180,000,\r\n     asking the right to vote on the question of license. This\r\n     prayer, like that of the 7,000, met the fate of all attempts of\r\n     disfranchised classes to influence legislation. Following this\r\n     repulse, in some ten or fifteen of the smaller cities of the\r\n     State, boards of common council were prevailed upon to pass\r\n     ordinances giving the women the right to vote on the question.\r\n     Without an exception, the result was overwhelming majorities for\r\n     \"No License.\" In the cities where officers were elected at the\r\n     same time, almost without exception, the majority of them were in\r\n     favor of license, while in those in which the old board of\r\n     officers held over, no licenses were granted, until the new board\r\n     elected only by the votes of the men of the city, was installed.\r\n     Dr. Alice B. Stockham, in her report at the Washington convention\r\n     of 1885, said:\r\n\r\n          After the city ordinance of Keithsburg allowed women to\r\n          vote, the hardest work was to convert the women themselves.\r\n          Committees were appointed who visited from house to house to\r\n          persuade women to go to the polls for the suppression of the\r\n          rule of liquor. On the morning of election they met in a\r\n          church for conference and prayer. At 10 o'clock forty brave\r\n          women marched to the polls and cast their first ballot for\r\n          home protection. Carriages were running to and fro all day\r\n          to bring the invalid and the aged. For once they were\r\n          induced to leave the making of ruffles and crazy quilts, to\r\n          give their silent voice for the suppression of vice. Three\r\n          weeks later not a woman could be found in the town opposed\r\n          to suffrage, and for one year not a glass of liquor could be\r\n          bought in Keithsburg.\r\n\r\n     Under the act of 1872, the women of Illinois thought their right\r\n     to pursue every avocation, except the military, secure. But in\r\n     1880, a judicial decision proved the contrary. We quote from the\r\n     _National Citizen_:\r\n\r\n          In June, 1879, the Circuit Court of Union County, Judge John\r\n          Dougherty presiding, appointed Helen A. Schuchardt, resident\r\n          of the county, to the office of Master in Chancery. Mrs.\r\n          Schuchardt gave bond with security approved by the court,\r\n          taking and subscribing the required oath of office. Since\r\n          that day, she has been the acting Master of Chancery of that\r\n          county, taking proofs, making judicial rules, and performing\r\n          the other various duties incident to such office. At the\r\n          last term of the court the State attorney, at the instance\r\n          of Mr. Frank Hall, relator, filed an information in the\r\n          nature of a _quo warranto_ charging that Mrs. Schuchardt had\r\n          usurped and was unlawfully holding and exercising the\r\n          office. Mrs. Schuchardt filed pleas setting forth the order\r\n          of the court appointing her, her bonds with the order of\r\n          approval, and the oath of office filed by her. To these\r\n          pleas a general demurrer was interposed and argued.\r\n\r\n          The questions presented by the demurrer were: _First_--Is\r\n          the defendant eligible to this office, she being neither a\r\n          practicing nor a learned lawyer? _Second_--Is the defendant\r\n          eligible to this office, she being a female? The court\r\n          dismissed the first question on the ground that the statute\r\n          does not require admission to the bar as a qualification. Of\r\n          the eleven Masters in Chancery in that Judicial Circuit, it\r\n          was shown that only five had been admitted to the bar. As to\r\n          the second objection, _i. e._, that Mrs. Schuchardt was a\r\n          female (!) it was decided that the common law never\r\n          contemplated the admittance of a woman to the office of\r\n          Master in Chancery, and that doubtless it was the first\r\n          instance in which a woman had been admitted to the office.\r\n          It was also decided that the act of March 22, 1872, did not\r\n          make women eligible to this office; Master in Chancery--for\r\n          woman--did not mean \"occupation, profession, or employment,\"\r\n          and that \"persons do not select an office, but are selected\r\n          for the office.\"\r\n\r\n          Judge Harker, in delivering this opinion, said: \"It is due\r\n          to Mrs. Schuchardt to say in conclusion, that while I am\r\n          constrained to sustain this demurrer and hold that under the\r\n          law she cannot retain this office, there is not one of the\r\n          Masters in Chancery in the four counties where I preside,\r\n          who has been more faithful or attentive in the discharge of\r\n          his duties, and none who has exhibited higher qualifications\r\n          to discharge well those duties. And it is my sincere hope\r\n          that at its next session the legislature will make this\r\n          office accessible to females.\"\r\n\r\n     One of the most influential local associations has been that of\r\n     Chicago, or Cook county.[371] From 1870 to 1876 Mrs. Jane Graham\r\n     Jones was its president, as well as the leading spirit in the\r\n     State Society.[372] She was the one to plan and execute the\r\n     attacks upon the board of education, the common council, and the\r\n     legislature, holding many meetings in Chicago, and at\r\n     Springfield, the seat of government. Another flourishing\r\n     association is that of Moline. We give the following from its\r\n     secretary:\r\n\r\n          In May, 1877, Mrs. Eunice G. Sayles, and Mrs. Julia Mills\r\n          Dunn, secured Mrs. Stanton to give a lecture on woman\r\n          suffrage in Moline, and at a reception given to her by Mrs.\r\n          Sayles, a society with 22 members was organized, which has\r\n          held meetings regularly since that time, with the reading of\r\n          papers on topics previously arranged by the president. It is\r\n          a matter of pride that not a failure has ever occurred, each\r\n          member always cheerfully performing the duty assigned her.\r\n          An evening reception is held annually to celebrate the\r\n          organization of the society, to which two hundred or more\r\n          guests are invited, each member being entitled to bring\r\n          several outside of her own family. The meetings have been\r\n          valuable, not only in promoting friendly relations between\r\n          the members, but also in the mental stimulus they have\r\n          afforded. Much of the success of this society is due to the\r\n          literary culture and earnestness of Mrs. Anne M. J. Dow, who\r\n          was our president for three years. We have sustained a great\r\n          loss in the death of Mrs. Sarah D. Nourse, who for\r\n          thirty-five years was an earnest friend of all reforms.\r\n\r\n          Soon after its organization, our society became auxiliary to\r\n          the National Association. We have circulated petitions and\r\n          forwarded them to Springfield and Washington, where they\r\n          have met the fate common to all prayers of the\r\n          disfranchised; we have circulated tracts, placed on file in\r\n          the public reading room all the suffrage journals, and\r\n          secured the best lecturers on the question. We are\r\n          organizing an afternoon reading society, to have read aloud\r\n          \"The History of Woman Suffrage,\" and shall soon place it on\r\n          the shelves of the public library of the village. While we\r\n          cannot point to any wonderful revolution in public sentiment\r\n          because of our work, we are nevertheless full of courage,\r\n          and under the leadership of our State president, Elizabeth\r\n          Boynton Harbert, we shall go forward in faith and good\r\n          works, hoping for the end of woman's political slavery.[373]\r\n\r\n     In concluding this meager record of the methods of earnest men\r\n     and women of Illinois in their brave work for liberty, we are\r\n     painfully conscious of a vast aggregate of personal toil and\r\n     self sacrifice which can never be reported. We write of petitions\r\n     presented to State and National legislative assemblies, but it is\r\n     impossible to record the personal sacrifice and moral heroism of\r\n     the women who went from house to house in the cities and\r\n     villages, or traveled long distances across the broad prairies to\r\n     secure the signatures. Only those who have carried a petition\r\n     from door to door can know the fatigue and humiliation of spirit\r\n     it involves. Though these earnest women ask only the influence of\r\n     the names of persons to help on our reform, they are often\r\n     treated with less courtesy than the dreaded book-agent and\r\n     peddler.\r\n\r\n                                                    WATSEKA, Ill.\r\n\r\n          I send you petitions, the one circulated by me has 270\r\n          names--the other by Clara L. Peters, 139.[374] We are\r\n          interested heart and soul in the movement, and our efforts\r\n          here have made many friends for the cause. Have been an\r\n          ardent worker since I was a child, and well remember that\r\n          grand hero of moral reforms, Samuel J. May of Syracuse, N.\r\n          Y., at a Woman's Temperance Convention held in Rochester in\r\n          1852, when I was eight years old.\r\n\r\n                                        VIOLA HAWKS ARCHIBALD.[375]\r\n\r\n     The following letter from Mary L. Davis, gives some idea of the\r\n     toils of circulating petitions:\r\n\r\n                         DAVIS, Stephenson Co., Ill., May 28, 1877.\r\n\r\n          EDITOR _Ballot-Box_:--The question of suffrage for woman has\r\n          been thoroughly discussed in our society, and last week I\r\n          started out with my petition. I could work but a short time\r\n          each day, but I systematically canvassed our beautiful\r\n          little village, taking it by streets, and although I have\r\n          been over but a small portion, I have ninety signatures. I\r\n          met with but little opposition, and with kind wishes in\r\n          abundance; with some amusing, some provoking, some pathetic,\r\n          and some disgusting phases of human nature--with very\r\n          agreeable disappointments, and very disagreeable ones. Very\r\n          often some person would say to me, there is no use in\r\n          calling at such a house; the man will not, and the woman\r\n          dare not, sign. I went to such a place last week, was met\r\n          with all the courtesy one could ask. The man looked over the\r\n          petition thoughtfully, affixed his own name, and asked his\r\n          wife if she did not wish to do so, and called in a beautiful\r\n          sister who was out playing ball with the children, telling\r\n          her as it was for the especial benefit of women, she ought\r\n          to sign it too. I write these things to encourage our young\r\n          girls, who will take up the work. Take every house, ask\r\n          every person; \"No,\" will not hurt or kill you. Be prepared\r\n          to meet every argument that can possibly be advanced. The\r\n          one which I meet oftenest, is that woman cannot fight, and\r\n          therefore she shall not vote; and strange to relate, it is\r\n          almost always advanced by a person who was never a soldier,\r\n          through physical disability, cowardice, or over or under\r\n          age.\r\n\r\n          The shortest \"No,\" without the slightest shadow of courtesy,\r\n          was shot from the lips of a man who is doing business on\r\n          capital furnished by his wife, and who lives in a house\r\n          purchased with his wife's money. Graceful return for her\r\n          devotion, wasn't it? I suppose he prefers to keep her in her\r\n          present state of serfdom, as, if she should ever find out\r\n          that she was of any importance in the world, except as his\r\n          housekeeper, cook, washerwoman, and waiter-in-general, she\r\n          might possibly inquire into the stewardship of her lord and\r\n          master. And it seemed to me if that ever came to pass, a man\r\n          who could say \"no\" so cavalierly, without even a \"thank you,\r\n          ma'am,\" or, \"you're quite welcome,\" both could and would\r\n          manage to make surroundings rather disagreeable to the party\r\n          of the second part. So far no person who has thought much,\r\n          read much, or suffered much, has refused to sign, and in the\r\n          few hours which I have devoted to the work, three\r\n          grandmothers nearly ninety years of age, wished to have\r\n          their names recorded on the right side of the question, and\r\n          in two of those instances the grandmother, daughter, and\r\n          grandfather affixed their signatures, one after\r\n          another.[376]\r\n\r\n     We have been permitted to copy the following private letter from\r\n     A.J. Grover to Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who is now at her\r\n     home in Tenafly, N. J., busily at work with Miss Anthony and Mrs.\r\n     Gage on the second volume of the \"History of Woman Suffrage.\" The\r\n     first volume should be on the center-table of every family in the\r\n     land as a complete text-book on the woman suffrage question,\r\n     which is to be one of the great issues, social and political, in\r\n     the coming years. These three women have grown old and won their\r\n     crowns of white hair in the cause of not only their sex, but of\r\n     mankind:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        CHICAGO, November 29, 1881.\r\n\r\n          MY DEAR FRIEND: You represent a movement of more importance\r\n          to mankind than any that ever before claimed attention in\r\n          the whole history of the race, viz.: the freedom of one-half\r\n          of it. You have enforced this claim by half a century of\r\n          heroic discussion--of persistent, unanswerable logic and\r\n          appeal against the theory and practice of all nations,\r\n          against all governments, codes and creeds. You proclaimed\r\n          fifty years ago the novel doctrine that woman by nature is,\r\n          and by law and usage should be, the absolute equal of man. A\r\n          claim so self-evident should only have to be stated to be\r\n          recognized by all civilized nations; and yet to this hour\r\n          the highest civilization, equally with the lowest, is built\r\n          on the slavery of woman. In the darkest corners of the earth\r\n          and on the sunlit heights of civilization, the mothers of\r\n          the race are by law, religion and custom doomed to\r\n          degradation. And if the seal of their bondage is never to be\r\n          broken, they themselves as well as the lords and masters\r\n          they serve, are equally unconscious of the servitude. No\r\n          religion, no civil government, has ever taught or recognized\r\n          any other condition for woman than that of subjection.\r\n          Against the accumulated precedents of all the ages, you and\r\n          your noble coaedjutors have rebelled in the face of derision\r\n          for fifty long, weary years. Was ever such sublime womanly\r\n          heroism and self-sacrifice before known? Was ever such worth\r\n          of culture, such wealth of womanhood, laid on the altar of\r\n          country and humanity? And all this comparatively\r\n          unrecognized and unrewarded. Where is the boasted chivalry\r\n          of the English-speaking nations? It is a virtue we boast of,\r\n          but do not possess. It never, in fact, had any real\r\n          existence based on genuine respect for woman. It is a bitter\r\n          sarcasm in the mouth of an American male citizen. A few men\r\n          like Theodore Parker, Joshua R. Giddings, William Lloyd\r\n          Garrison, Wendell Phillips, Gerrit Smith, Samuel J. May and\r\n          Parker Pillsbury have measurably redeemed this nation,\r\n          recognizing your claim for woman as self-evidently just and\r\n          righteous, and cooeperating with you in maintaining it. There\r\n          are only a score or two of such men in a generation with\r\n          sufficient chivalry or perception of justice to publicly\r\n          claim for women the rights they themselves possess.\r\n\r\n          Science has demonstrated that men to be manly must be well\r\n          born, must have noble mothers. How can a mother give birth\r\n          to a noble soul while herself a slave? How can she impart a\r\n          free spirit when her own is servile? A stream cannot rise\r\n          higher than its fountain.\r\n\r\n          We have thought to bring about a high order of civilization\r\n          by freeing our sons, while chaining our daughters, by\r\n          sending sons to college and daughters to menial service for\r\n          a mere pittance as wages, or selling them in marriage to the\r\n          highest bidder--by robbing them on the very threshold of\r\n          life of all noble ambition. By the degradation of our women\r\n          we take from the inherited qualities of the race as much as\r\n          is added by culture. We take from the metal before casting\r\n          as much as we restore by polish afterwards, and thus we\r\n          curse and stultify both sexes.\r\n\r\n          The law and religion of man can be no better than man\r\n          himself. If religion, law, justice and social order are to\r\n          improve, man must first be improved. Religion and law are\r\n          effects, not causes. They are fruits, not the tree--the\r\n          products of the human mind. If these are to be improved,\r\n          mankind must first be improved. This will be impossible\r\n          until freedom and culture shall become the inalienable\r\n          rights of woman. It would be a thousand times better, if\r\n          either must be a slave to the other, that man should be a\r\n          slave to woman. The History of Woman Suffrage, on which you\r\n          are engaged, if the second volume shall prove equal to the\r\n          first, will be the richest legacy this age will bequeath to\r\n          the future. It is a revelation from God, in which, if men\r\n          believe, they shall be saved. Religion itself, without this\r\n          great salvation, will continue to remain little else than \"a\r\n          wretched record of inspired crime\" against woman. Woman must\r\n          be free! Protection as an underling from man, savage or\r\n          civilized, she in reality never had and never will have.\r\n          Protection she does not want. What she needs is equal\r\n          rights, when she can protect herself--rights of person,\r\n          rights of labor, rights of property, rights of culture,\r\n          rights of leisure, rights to participate in the making and\r\n          administering of the laws. Give her equality in exchange for\r\n          protection; give her her earnings in exchange for support;\r\n          give her justice in exchange for charity. Let man trust\r\n          woman as woman trusts man, with entire liberty of action,\r\n          and she will show the world that liberty is her highest\r\n          good.\r\n\r\n          In conclusion, let me confess that I read your first volume\r\n          with a feeling of inexpressible shame and mortification for\r\n          my sex.\r\n\r\n                                   Yours faithfully,\r\n                                                       A.J. GROVER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elizabeth Boynton Harbert]\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Boynton Harbert, to whom we are indebted for this chapter, has\r\nfrom girlhood been an enthusiastic advocate of the rights of women.\r\nGrowing up in Crawfordsville, Indiana, under the very shadow of a\r\ncollegiate institution into which girls were not permitted to\r\nenter, she early learned the humiliation of sex. After vain\r\nattempts to slip the bolts riveted with precedent and prejudice\r\nthat barred the daughters of the State outside, she tried with pen\r\nand voice to rouse those whose stronger hands could open wide the\r\ndoors to the justice of her appeals. Her youthful peaens to liberty\r\nin prose and verse early found their way into our Eastern journals,\r\nand later in arguments before conventions and legislative\r\nassemblies in Illinois, Iowa and other Western States. As editor\r\nfor seven years of the \"Woman's Kingdom\" in the Chicago\r\n_Inter-Ocean_--one of the most popular journals in the nation--she\r\nhas exerted a widespread influence over the lives of women,\r\nbringing new hope and ambition into many prairie homes. As\r\neditor-in-chief of the _New Era_, in which she is free to utter her\r\ndeepest convictions; as wife and mother, with life's multiplied\r\nexperiences, a wider outlook now opens before her, with added\r\nwisdom for the responsibilities involved in public life. In all her\r\nendeavors she has been nobly sustained by her husband, Mr. William\r\nHarbert, a successful lawyer, many years in practice in Chicago,\r\nwhose clear judgment and generous sympathies have made his services\r\ninvaluable in the reform movements of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[351] Judge and Mrs. Catharine V.

Speaking of the large number of\r\nwomen elected to the office of county superintendent (one of them\r\nher own daughter), she told me that thirty years ago when she\r\narrived at the settlement where she had been engaged as teacher,\r\nthe trustees being unable to make the \"examination\" deputed one of\r\ntheir number to take her to an adjoining county, where another New\r\nEngland girl was teaching. The excursion was made in a lumber wagon\r\nwith an ox-team. All the ordinary questions asked and promptly\r\nanswered, the trustee rather hesitatingly said, \"Now, while you're\r\nabout it, wouldn't you just as lief write out the certificate?\"\r\nThis was readily done, and the man affixing his cross thereto,\r\ntriumphantly carried the applicant back to his district, announcing\r\nher duly qualified to teach; and that trio of unlettered\r\nmen installed the cultivated New England girl in their log\r\nschool-house, probably without the thought entering the heads of\r\ntrustees or teacher, that woman, when better educated, should hold\r\nthe superior position.--[S.

How many of these memory recalls\r\nin the State of Illinois! What a hospitable reception we had in the\r\ncozy farm-house of Mrs. Owen Lovejoy at Princeton, and in the\r\nstately residence of Mrs. Noyes Kendall at La Moile, in the home of\r\nJudge Lawrence at Galesburg, Mrs. Judge Joslyn at Woodstock, Mrs.\r\nR.M.

An unfriendly report\r\nin any journal was uniformly followed by an invitation to dinner to\r\nthe editor or some one of his staff, to meet the lady criticised,\r\nor discuss the point of attack. Miss Emily Faithful, Mrs. Stanton,\r\nMiss Anthony and Miss Couzins have all in turn shared these dinners\r\nand discussions. If the Methodist Episcopal conference sent an\r\nopponent to preach in their church, and a little social attention\r\ndid not convert him, two persons left the church. Neither Mrs.\r\nJones nor her husband would listen to the Rev. Dr. Hatfield, for\r\nFernando Jones was always as staunch an advocate of the suffrage\r\nfor women as his wife, and had no faith in a religion that did not\r\nteach human equality.--[S. B.

A little research into\r\nhistory shows that there must have been some liberal statesmen,\r\nsome men endowed with wisdom and a sense of justice, who influenced\r\nthe early legislation in Missouri.\r\n\r\nBy the constitution, imprisonment for debt is forbidden, except for\r\nfines and penalties imposed for violation of law. A homestead not\r\nexceeding $3,000 in value in cities of 40,000 inhabitants or more,\r\nand not exceeding $1,500 in smaller cities and in the country, is\r\nexempt from levy on execution. The real estate of a married woman\r\nis not liable for the debts of her husband. There are eight causes\r\nfor divorce, so many doors of escape for unfortunate wives from the\r\nbondage of a joyless union.\r\n\r\nThe memory of the unjust treatment of Miss Hosmer will always be a\r\nreproach to Massachusetts. That she enjoyed the privileges of\r\neducation in Missouri denied her in Massachusetts was due in no\r\nsmall measure to the generosity and public spirit of Wayman Crow.\r\nSpeaking of the gifted sculptor, a correspondent says:\r\n\r\n     Harriet Hosmer was born in 1830. She studied sculpture in the\r\n     studio of Mr. Stephenson, in Boston, and also with her father. In\r\n     1830, after being denied admission to anatomical lectures in\r\n     Harvard and many other colleges at the East, she went to St.\r\n     Louis, where, through the spirited determination of Wayman Crow,\r\n     a most liberal benefactor of Washington University, she was\r\n     admitted to the Missouri Medical College through the kindness and\r\n     courtesy of Dr. Joseph N. McDowell, its founder and head. Here\r\n     for a whole winter she pursued her studies under the instruction\r\n     of Dr. McDowell and Dr. Louis T. Pim, the able demonstrator of\r\n     anatomy of the college, who gave her the benefit of their\r\n     constant and unremitting aid; also Dr. B. Gratz Moses and Dr. J.\r\n     B. Johnson were particularly kind in inviting her to be present\r\n     when important cases were before them. The names of these men are\r\n     gratefully mentioned, now that the doors of hundreds of colleges\r\n     have opened to women. While in St. Louis Miss Hosmer had a\r\n     constant companion and friend in Miss Jane Peck, a lady well\r\n     known in society circles, and together they daily attended at the\r\n     college; indeed, Miss Peck informed the writer, that on no\r\n     occasion did Miss Hosmer go to the college without her. So\r\n     quietly was this done, it was not until the month of February\r\n     that the students became aware of their attending, and when\r\n     informed of it the entire class, numbering about one hundred and\r\n     thirty, gave them a most cordial and hearty endorsement, and from\r\n     that time on until the day of graduation they were treated by the\r\n     young gentlemen with marked attention. The students were not\r\n     aware of their attending in the earlier part of the course,\r\n     because it had been the custom for the ladies to attend in the\r\n     amphitheater after the class had left to go to the various\r\n     hospitals. On one occasion while on their way to the college, a\r\n     number of the students being behind them, they heard the\r\n     gentlemen say to some men they met, \"These ladies are under our\r\n     charge, and if you offer them an insult we will shoot you down.\"\r\n     They did not hear the language of the men, only the reply of the\r\n     students. At the close of the session the students gave a ball\r\n     and not only were Miss Hosmer and Miss Peck invited, but a\r\n     carriage was specially sent to take them to it.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1869, Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony again visited St.\r\nLouis. In a letter to _The Revolution_ the former said:\r\n\r\n     We went to the Mercantile Library to see Miss Hosmer's works of\r\n     art, and there read the following letter to Wayman Crow, who had\r\n     been a generous friend to her through all those early days of\r\n     trial and disappointment. One of the best of her productions is\r\n     an admirable bust of her noble benefactor:\r\n\r\n                                   BOSTON, October 18, 1857.\r\n\r\n          DEAR MR. CROW: Will you allow me to convey through you to\r\n          the Mercantile Library Association \"The Beatrice Cenci.\"\r\n          This statue is in execution of a commission I received three\r\n          years ago from a friend who requested me not only to make a\r\n          piece of statuary for that institution, but to present it in\r\n          my own name. I have finished the work, but cannot offer it\r\n          as my own gift--but of one who, with a most liberal hand,\r\n          has largely ministered to the growth of the arts and\r\n          sciences in your beautiful city. For your sake, and for\r\n          mine, I would have made a better statue if I could. The will\r\n          was not wanting, but the power--but such as it is, I rejoice\r\n          sincerely that it is destined for St. Louis, a city I love,\r\n          not only because it was there I first began my studies, but\r\n          because of the many generous and indulgent friends who dwell\r\n          therein--of whom I number you most generous and indulgent of\r\n          all, whose increasing kindness I can only repay by striving\r\n          to become more and more worthy of all your friendship and\r\n          confidence, and so I am ever affectionately and gratefully\r\n          yours,\r\n\r\n          _Wayman Crow, Esq._                        H.G. HOSMER.\r\n\r\nThe very active part that the women of Missouri had taken in the\r\ncivil war, in the hospitals and sanitary department, had aroused\r\ntheir enthusiasm in the preservation of the Union and their sense\r\nof responsibility in national affairs. The great mass-meetings of\r\nthe Loyal Women's Leagues, too, did an immense educational work in\r\nbroadening their sympathies and the horizon of their sphere of\r\naction. So wholly absorbed had they been in the intense excitement\r\nof that period, that when peace came their hands and hearts,\r\nunoccupied, naturally turned to new fields of achievement. While in\r\nsome States it was the temperance question, in St. Louis it was\r\nspecifically woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted for the main facts of this chapter to Mr. Francis\r\nMinor, Mrs. Rebecca N. Hazard, Miss Couzins and Miss Arathusa\r\nForbes, who have kindly sent us what information they had or could\r\nhastily glean from the journals of the time or the imperfect\r\nrecords of the association.\r\n\r\n     The labors of Mrs. Minor and Mrs. Couzins were exceptionally\r\n     protracted and severe. The latter offered her services as nurse\r\n     at the very opening of the war. The letters received from men in\r\n     authority show how highly their services were appreciated.

A._\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HEADQUARTERS DEP'T OF THE TENNESSEE, }\r\n                              BEFORE VICKSBURG, Feb'y 21st, 1863.  }\r\n\r\n          The quartermaster in charge of transportation at Memphis,\r\n          Tenn., will furnish transportation on any chartered steamer\r\n          plying between Memphis, Tenn., and St. Louis, to Mrs.\r\n          Couzins and five other ladies, members of the Western\r\n          Sanitary Commission, and who have been with this fleet\r\n          distributing sanitary goods for the benefit of sick\r\n          soldiers.\r\n\r\n                                          U.S. GRANT, _Maj.-Gen. Com_.\r\n\r\n          Capt. J. B. LEWIS,\r\n               _A. Q. M. and Master of Transportation_, Memphis, Tenn.\r\n\r\n     While Mrs. Couzins thus gave herself to mitigating the sufferings\r\n     of the \"boys in blue,\" in camp and hospital, Mrs. Minor was no\r\n     less active and energetic in the equally important department of\r\n     preserving supplies for the sanitary commission. Although Mrs.\r\n     Minor resided too far from the city to attend the evening\r\n     meetings, and her name does not appear in the accounts of such\r\n     gatherings, she was one of the first members of the Ladies' Union\r\n     Aid Society of St. Louis, and took part in the meeting of loyal\r\n     women called and presided over by Gen. Curtis. Having an orchard\r\n     and dairy on her place, she furnished the hospital with milk and\r\n     fruit, and for more than two years, sent a supply every day to\r\n     the soldiers in camp at Benton barracks. When the news came that\r\n     the army around Vicksburg was suffering with scurvy, she took her\r\n     carriage and drove through the country soliciting fruit, and in\r\n     one week she canned with her own hands, a wagon-load of cherries,\r\n     the sanitary commission finding the cans and sugar, and from time\r\n     to time she continued the work until the end of the war. When the\r\n     great fair was held under the auspices of the Western Sanitary\r\n     Commission, she was a member of the floral department, and\r\n     worked with her accustomed energy. The sanitary commission,\r\n     feeling that she had done so much, wrote her a letter of thanks,\r\n     and enclosed her a check for a liberal amount; but she returned\r\n     the check, saying that hers was a work of love, and not for\r\n     money. Although the official letter of the commission thanking\r\n     Mrs. Minor for her most valuable services, is lost, the following\r\n     to Mr. Minor may fairly be considered as including her also:\r\n\r\n\r\n          ROOMS WESTERN SANITARY COMMISSION, St. Louis, Oct. 7, 1863.\r\n\r\n          FRANCIS MINOR, Esq.--_My Dear Sir_: I am directed by our\r\n          board to return you their thanks in behalf of the soldiers\r\n          in the hospitals, for your long-continued remembrance of\r\n          them, and for the daily supply of fresh fruits, vegetables\r\n          and milk, which you have furnished for the sick, now more\r\n          than two years. Your garner and sympathy have been like the\r\n          widow's cruse, and may they ever continue to be so. What you\r\n          have done has been in the most quiet and unobtrusive way.\r\n          The sick soldier has had no more constant, uniform and\r\n          untiring friend, and it is with pleasure that I convey the\r\n          thanks of the board, both to yourself and wife, who have\r\n          been as indefatigable at home in preparing canned fruits and\r\n          other delicacies for the sick soldiers in the field, as you\r\n          have been in providing for those in the hospitals. With\r\n          grateful feelings and many thanks and best wishes, I remain,\r\n\r\n                    Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                        JAMES E. YEATMAN,\r\n                              _President Western Sanitary Commission_.\r\n\r\n     The submission of a constitutional amendment in Kansas, and the\r\n     preparations for a thorough canvass of that State, had its\r\n     influence in heightening the enthusiasm and increasing the\r\n     agitation in Missouri, as most of the speakers going to Kansas\r\n     held meetings at various points. Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony\r\n     stopped at St. Louis both going and returning, held large\r\n     meetings in Library Hall, and had a pleasant reception in the\r\n     parlors of the Southern Hotel, where many warm friendships that\r\n     have lasted ever since, were formed.\r\n\r\n     The subject of woman's enfranchisement had doubtless often\r\n     occurred to the thoughtful men and women of Missouri, long before\r\n     the movement in its behalf assumed anything like a practical\r\n     shape. The manifest absurdity and injustice of declaring, as the\r\n     constitution of the State did, \"that all political power is\r\n     vested in, and derived from the people; that all government of\r\n     right originates from the people, is founded upon their will\r\n     only, and is instituted solely for the good of the whole,\" and at\r\n     the same time, denying to one-half of the people any voice\r\n     whatever in framing their government or making their laws, could\r\n     not fail to strike the attention of any one who gave the subject\r\n     the slightest consideration. But no attempt was made towards an\r\n     organization in behalf of woman suffrage until the winter of\r\n     1866-7; and the movement then had its origin from the following\r\n     circumstance: During the debate in the Senate of the United\r\n     States, on the district suffrage bill, December 12, 1866, Senator\r\n     Brown, of Missouri, in the course of his remarks said:\r\n\r\n          I have to say then, sir, here on the floor of the American\r\n          Senate, I stand for universal suffrage, and as a matter of\r\n          fundamental principle do not recognize the right of society\r\n          to limit it on any ground of race, color, or sex. I will go\r\n          further, and say that I recognize the right of franchise as\r\n          being intrinsically a natural right; and I do not believe\r\n          that society is authorized to impose any limitation upon it\r\n          that does not spring out of the necessities of the social\r\n          state itself.\r\n\r\n     When Mrs. Francis Minor, of St. Louis, who had given the subject\r\n     much thought, read the report of Senator Brown's speech, she\r\n     considered that it was due to him from the women of the State\r\n     that he should receive a letter of thanks for his bold and\r\n     out-spoken utterances in their behalf. She accordingly wrote him\r\n     such a letter, obtaining to it all the signatures she could, and\r\n     it was presented to Senator Brown on his return home. But\r\n     although first an advocate of the measure, he soon recanted, and\r\n     gave his influence against it.\r\n\r\n     It was next determined to petition the legislature of the State\r\n     then in session, January, 1867, to propose an amendment to the\r\n     constitution, striking out the word \"male,\" in the article on\r\n     suffrage. Such a petition was presented, and attracted much\r\n     attention, as it was the first instance of the kind in the\r\n     history of the State. This move was followed by a formal\r\n     organization of the friends of the cause, and on May 8, 1867, the\r\n     \"Missouri Woman Suffrage Association\" was organized, and officers\r\n     elected.[378]\r\n\r\n     We find the following letter from Mr. Minor in _The Revolution_\r\n     of January 22, 1868:\r\n\r\n          _Editors of The Revolution_: In order to show the steady\r\n          progress that the grand idea of equal rights is slowly but\r\n          surely making among the people of these United States, I\r\n          think it would be well, in the beginning, at least, to make\r\n          a record in _The Revolution_ of the fact of each successive\r\n          State organization; and for that purpose I send you the list\r\n          of officers for the association in Missouri not yet a year\r\n          old; as also their petition to the legislature for a change\r\n          in the organic law, and a brief address to the voters of the\r\n          State, in support of the movement:\r\n\r\n          _To the Voters of Missouri:_\r\n\r\n          The women of this State, having organized for the purpose of\r\n          agitating their claims to the ballot, it becomes every\r\n          intelligent and reflecting mind to consider the question\r\n          fairly and dispassionately. If it has merits, it will\r\n          eventually succeed; if not, it will fail. I am of the number\r\n          of those who believe that claim to be just and right, for\r\n          the following, among other reasons:\r\n\r\n          Taxation and Representation should go hand in hand. This is\r\n          the very corner-stone of our government. Its founders\r\n          declared, and the declaration cannot be too often repeated,\r\n          \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are\r\n          created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with\r\n          certain inalienable rights; that among these are life,\r\n          liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure those\r\n          rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their\r\n          just powers from the consent of the governed.\" The man who\r\n          believes in that declaration, cannot justly deny to women\r\n          the right of suffrage. They are citizens, they are\r\n          tax-payers; they bear the burdens of government--why should\r\n          they be denied the rights of citizens? We boast about\r\n          liberty and equality before the law, when the truth is, our\r\n          government is controlled by one-half only of the population.\r\n          The others have no more voice in the making of their laws,\r\n          or the selection of their rulers, than the criminals who are\r\n          in our penitentiaries; nay, in one respect, their condition\r\n          is not as good as that of the felon, for he may be pardoned\r\n          and restored to a right which woman can never obtain. And\r\n          this, not because she has committed any crime, or violated\r\n          any law, but simply because she is, what God made her--a\r\n          woman! Possessed of the same intelligence--formed in the\r\n          same mold--having the same attributes, parts and\r\n          passions--held by her Maker to the same measure of\r\n          responsibility here and hereafter, her actual position in\r\n          society to-day is that of an inferior. No matter what her\r\n          qualifications may be, every avenue of success is virtually\r\n          closed against her. Even when she succeeds in obtaining\r\n          employment, she gets only half the pay that a man does for\r\n          the same work. But, it is said, woman's sphere is at home.\r\n          Would giving her the right to vote interfere with her home\r\n          duties any more than it does with a man's business? Again it\r\n          is said, that for her to vote would be unfeminine. Is it at\r\n          all more indelicate for a woman to go to the polls, than it\r\n          is for her to go to the court-house and pay her taxes? The\r\n          truth is, woman occupies just the position that man has\r\n          placed her in, and it ill becomes him to urge such\r\n          objections. Give her a chance--give her the opportunity of\r\n          proving whether these objections are well founded or not.\r\n          Her influence for good is great, notwithstanding all the\r\n          disadvantages under which she at present labors; and my firm\r\n          belief is, that that influence would be greatly enhanced and\r\n          extended by the exercise of this new right. It would be felt\r\n          at the ballot-box and in the halls of legislation. Better\r\n          men, as a general rule, would be elected to office, and\r\n          society in all its ramifications, would feel and rejoice at\r\n          the change.\r\n\r\n                                                       A VOTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _To the General Assembly of the State of Missouri: _\r\n\r\n          GENTLEMEN: The undersigned women of Missouri, believing that\r\n          all citizens who are taxed for the support of the government\r\n          and subject to its laws, should have a voice in the making\r\n          of those laws, and the selection of their rulers; that, as\r\n          the possession of the ballot ennobles and elevates the\r\n          character of man, so, in like manner, it would ennoble and\r\n          elevate that of woman by giving her a direct and personal\r\n          interest in the affairs of government; and further,\r\n          believing that the spirit of the age, as well as every\r\n          consideration of justice and equity, requires that the\r\n          ballot should be extended to our sex, do unite in praying\r\n          that an amendment to the constitution may be proposed,\r\n          striking out the word \"male\" and extending to women the\r\n          right of suffrage.\r\n\r\n          And, as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray.\r\n\r\n          On behalf of the Missouri Woman Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n          [Signed:] _President_, Mrs. Francis Minor; _Vice-President_,\r\n          Mrs. Beverly Allen; _Corresponding Secretary_, Mrs. Wm. T.\r\n          Hazard; _Recording Secretary_, Mrs. Geo. D. Hall;\r\n          _Treasurer_, Mrs. N. Stevens, St. Louis, Missouri.\r\n\r\n          Copies of the petition, and information furnished upon\r\n          addressing either of above named officers. Formation of\r\n          auxiliary associations in every county requested. Petitions\r\n          when completely signed, to be returned to the head office.\r\n\r\n          These papers will serve to show that the idea has taken root\r\n          in other States beyond the Mississippi besides Kansas; and\r\n          may also be somewhat of a guide to others, who may desire to\r\n          accomplish the same purpose elsewhere. A work of such\r\n          magnitude requires, of course, time for development; but the\r\n          leaven is working. The fountains of the great deep of public\r\n          thought have been broken up. The errors and prejudices of\r\n          six thousand years are yielding to the sunlight of truth. In\r\n          spite of pulpits and politicians, the great idea is making\r\n          its way to the hearts of the people; and woman may rejoice\r\n          in believing that the dawn of her deliverance, so long hoped\r\n          for and prayed for, is at last approaching.\r\n\r\n                                                       F. M.\r\n\r\n          _St. Louis_, January, 1868.\r\n\r\nThe following from _The Revolution_ shows that the women of St.\r\nLouis were awake on the question of taxation:\r\n\r\n     The women here have endeavored to find out to what extent\r\n     taxation without representation, because of sex, obtains in this\r\n     city, and as the result of their inquiries they are enabled to\r\n     place on their records the following very suggestive document.\r\n\r\n                         ASSESSOR'S OFFICE, ST. LOUIS, January 30, 1869.\r\n\r\n          _To Mrs. Couzins and Emma Finkelnburg, Committee of the\r\n          Ladies' Suffrage Association:_\r\n\r\n          In reply to your request to report to your association the\r\n          amount of property listed in the city of St. Louis in the\r\n          name of ladies, permit me to state that the property in\r\n          question is represented by over 2,000 tax-paying ladies, and\r\n          assessed at the value of $14,490,199.\r\n\r\n                                   Yours very respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                        ROBT. J. ROMBAUER, _Assessor_.\r\n\r\n     This exhibit has opened the eyes of a good many people. \"Two\r\n     thousand on 'em,\" exclaimed a male friend of mine, \"and over\r\n     fourteen millions of property! Whew! What business have these\r\n     women with so much money?\" Well, they have it, and now they ask\r\n     us, \"Shall 2,000 men, not worth a dollar, just because they wear\r\n     pantaloons go to the polls and vote taxes on us, while we are\r\n     excluded from the ballot-box for no other reason than sex?\" What\r\n     _shall_ we say to them? They ask us if the American Revolution\r\n     did not turn on this hinge, _No taxation without representation_.\r\n     Who can answer?\r\n\r\n     The advocates of suffrage in St. Louis made their attacks at once\r\n     in both Church[379] and State, and left no means of agitation\r\n     untried. There has never been an association in any State that\r\n     comprised so many able men and women who gave their best thoughts\r\n     to every phase of this question, and who did so grand a work,\r\n     until the unfortunate division in 1871, which seemed to chill the\r\n     enthusiasm of many friends of the movement.\r\n\r\n     In the winter of 1869 the association sent a large delegation of\r\n     ladies to the legislature with a petition containing about 2,000\r\n     signatures. A correspondent in _The Revolution_, February 6,\r\n     1869, said:\r\n\r\n          It will not be feminine to say, yet I fear I must say, the\r\n          women of Missouri have stormed their capitol, and if it is\r\n          not yet taken, the outworks are in our hands, and I believe\r\n          with a few more well-directed blows the victory will be\r\n          ours. On February 3 a large delegation of ladies,\r\n          representing the Suffrage Association of Missouri, visited\r\n          Jefferson City for the purpose of laying before the\r\n          legislature a large and influentially signed petition,\r\n          asking the ballot for women; and we were gratified to see\r\n          the great respect and deference shown to the women of\r\n          Missouri by the wisest and best of her legislators in their\r\n          respectful and cordial reception of the delegates. Both\r\n          Houses adjourned, and gave the use of the house for the\r\n          afternoon, when eloquent addresses were made by Mrs. J.G.\r\n          Phelps of Springfield, Dr. Ada Greunan of St. Louis, and the\r\n          future orator of Missouri, Miss Phoebe Couzins, whose able\r\n          and effective address the press has given in full. Of the\r\n          brave men who stood up for us, it is more difficult to\r\n          speak. To give a list would be impossible; for every name\r\n          would require a eulogy too lengthy for the pages of _The\r\n          Revolution_. We will, therefore, record them on the tablets\r\n          of our memory with a hand so firm that they shall stand out\r\n          brightly till time shall be no more. Of the small majority\r\n          who oppose us we will say nothing, but throw over them the\r\n          pall of merciful oblivion.\r\n\r\n     The first woman suffrage convention ever held in the city of St.\r\n     Louis, or the State of Missouri, assembled in Mercantile Library,\r\n     October 6, 7, 1869. Many distinguished people were on the\r\n     platform.[380] At this convention Mr. Francis Minor introduced a\r\n     very able series of resolutions, on which Mrs. Minor made a\r\n     remarkably logical address.[381] The following letter from Mr.\r\n     Minor shows the careful research he gave to the consideration of\r\n     this question:\r\n\r\n                                   ST. LOUIS, December 30, 1869.\r\n\r\n          DEAR REVOLUTION: So thoroughly am I satisfied that the\r\n          surest and most direct course to pursue to obtain a\r\n          recognition of woman's claim to the ballot, lies through the\r\n          courts of the country, that I am induced to ask you to\r\n          republish the resolutions that I drafted, and which were\r\n          unanimously adopted by the St. Louis convention. And I will\r\n          here add, that to accomplish this end, and to carry these\r\n          resolutions into practical effect, it is intended by Mrs.\r\n          Minor, the president of the State Association, to make a\r\n          test case in her instance at our next election; take it\r\n          through the courts of Missouri, and thence to the Supreme\r\n          Court of the United States at Washington. I think it will be\r\n          admitted that these resolutions place the cause of woman\r\n          upon higher ground than ever before asserted, in the fact\r\n          that for the first time suffrage is claimed as a privilege\r\n          based upon citizenship, and secured by the Constitution of\r\n          the United States. It will be seen that the position taken\r\n          is, that the States have the right to regulate, but not to\r\n          prohibit, the elective franchise to citizens of the United\r\n          States. Thus the States may determine the qualifications of\r\n          electors. They may require the elector to be of a certain\r\n          age, to have had a fixed residence, to be of a sane mind,\r\n          and unconvicted of crime, etc., because these are\r\n          qualifications or conditions that all citizens, sooner or\r\n          later, may attain; but to go beyond this, and say to\r\n          one-half the citizens of the State, notwithstanding you\r\n          possess all these qualifications you shall never vote, is of\r\n          the very essence of despotism. It is a bill of attainder of\r\n          the most odious character.\r\n\r\n          A further investigation of the subject will show that the\r\n          language of the constitutions of all the States, with the\r\n          exception of those of Massachusetts and Virginia, on the\r\n          subject of suffrage is peculiar. They almost all read\r\n          substantially alike: \"White male citizens, etc., shall be\r\n          entitled to vote,\" and this is supposed to exclude all other\r\n          citizens. There is no direct exclusion, except in the two\r\n          States above named. Now the error lies in supposing that an\r\n          enabling clause is necessary at all. The right of the people\r\n          of a State to participate in a government of their own\r\n          creation requires no enabling clause; neither can it be\r\n          taken from them by implication. To hold otherwise would be\r\n          to interpolate in the constitution a prohibition that does\r\n          not exist. In framing a constitution the people are\r\n          assembled in their sovereign capacity; and being possessed\r\n          of all rights and all powers, what is not surrendered is\r\n          retained. Nothing short of a direct prohibition can work a\r\n          disseizin of rights that are fundamental. In the language of\r\n          John Jay to the people of New York, urging the adoption of\r\n          the Constitution of the United States, \"silence and blank\r\n          paper neither give nor take away anything,\" and Alexander\r\n          Hamilton says (_Federalist_, No. 83), \"Every man of\r\n          discernment must at once perceive the wide difference\r\n          between silence and abolition.\"\r\n\r\n          The mode and manner in which the people shall take part in\r\n          the government of their creation may be prescribed by the\r\n          constitution, but the right itself is antecedent to all\r\n          constitutions. It is inalienable, and can neither be bought,\r\n          nor sold, nor given away. But even if it should be held that\r\n          this view is untenable, and that women are disfranchised by\r\n          the several State constitutions directly, or by implication,\r\n          then I say that such prohibitions are clearly in conflict\r\n          with the Constitution of the United States, and yield\r\n          thereto. The language of that instrument is clear and\r\n          emphatic: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United\r\n          States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are\r\n          citizens of the United States, and of the State wherein they\r\n          reside.\" \"No State shall make, or enforce any law that shall\r\n          abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the\r\n          United States.\" It would be impossible to add to the force\r\n          or effect of such language, and equally impossible to\r\n          attempt to explain it away.\r\n\r\n                                   Very respectfully,    FRANCIS MINOR.\r\n\r\n     The St. Louis _Democrat_ spoke of the convention as follows:\r\n\r\n          Readers of our report have doubtless been interested to\r\n          observe the fair spirit and dignified manner of the woman\r\n          suffrage convention, and the ability displayed in some of\r\n          the addresses. It is but due to the managers to say that\r\n          they extended most courteous invitations to gentlemen not\r\n          identified with the movement to address the convention, and\r\n          state freely their objections to the extension of the\r\n          franchise. Of those invited some were prevented by duties\r\n          elsewhere from attending. Others, it may be, felt that it\r\n          would scarcely be a gracious thing, in spite of the\r\n          liberality of the invitation, to occupy the time of a\r\n          convention in favor of the extension of the franchise with\r\n          arguments against it. But the objections which, after all,\r\n          probably have most weight with candid men are those which it\r\n          is not easy to discuss in public, namely: \"Will not\r\n          extension of suffrage to women have an injurious effect upon\r\n          the family and sexual relations?\" \"Will not the ballot be\r\n          used rather by that class who would not use it wisely than\r\n          by those who are most competent?\" We do not argue these\r\n          questions, but are sure that some frank discussion of them,\r\n          however delicate the subject may be, is necessary to\r\n          convince the great majority of those who are still doubting\r\n          or opposed. Meanwhile the reports are of interest, and\r\n          reflect no little credit upon the women of this city who\r\n          have taken so prominent a part in the movement.\r\n\r\n     The officers of the Missouri Society were annually reelected for\r\n     several years, and the work proceeded harmoniously until the\r\n     division in the National Association. The members of the Missouri\r\n     Society took sides in this division as preference dictated. Mr.\r\n     and Mrs. Minor, Miss Forbes, Miss Couzins and others were already\r\n     members of the National Association, and sympathized with its\r\n     views and modes of pushing the question.\r\n\r\n     In order that there might be no division in the Missouri\r\n     Association, a resolution was introduced by Mr. Minor and\r\n     unanimously adopted, declaring that each member of the society\r\n     should be free to join the National body of his or her choice,\r\n     and that the Missouri Association, as a society, should not\r\n     become auxiliary to either the \"National\" or the \"American.\" The\r\n     good faith of the association was thus pledged to respect the\r\n     feelings and wishes of each member, and as long as this course\r\n     was observed all went well. But, at the annual meeting in 1871,\r\n     just after Mrs. Minor had for the fifth time been unanimously\r\n     reelected president, in violation of the previous action of the\r\n     association a resolution was introduced and passed, declaring\r\n     that the association should henceforth become auxiliary to the\r\n     American. This gross disregard of the wishes and feelings of\r\n     those who were members of the National Association left them no\r\n     alternative, with any feeling of self-respect, but to withdraw;\r\n     and accordingly Mrs. Minor at once tendered her resignation as\r\n     president and her withdrawal as a member of the association. She\r\n     was followed in this course by Mr. Minor, Miss Couzins, Miss\r\n     Forbes and others.[382] However, the work went steadily on.\r\n     Meetings were held regularly from week to week, with occasional\r\n     grand conventions, tracts and petitions were circulated, and\r\n     constant agitation in some way kept up.\r\n\r\nIn answer to an earnest solicitation for facts and incidents of the\r\nsuffrage movement in Missouri, Mrs. Rebecca N. Hazard, one of the\r\nearliest and most active friends in that State, sends us the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     I think the cruel war had much to do in educating the women of\r\n     Missouri into a sense of their responsibilities and duties as\r\n     citizens; at least all who first took part in the suffrage\r\n     movement had been active on the Union side during the war, and\r\n     that having ended in the preservation of the government, they\r\n     naturally began to inquire as to their own rights and privileges\r\n     in the restored Union. My own feelings were first fully awakened\r\n     by the hanging of Mrs. Surrat; for, although a Unionist and an\r\n     abolitionist, I could but regard her execution by the government,\r\n     considering her helpless position, as judicial murder. I wrote on\r\n     the subject to the editor of the New York _Independent_. The\r\n     letter was handed to Miss Anthony, and resulted in an invitation\r\n     to the next meeting of the Equal Rights Society. This almost\r\n     frightened me, for I had hitherto looked askance at the woman's\r\n     rights movement.\r\n\r\n     Meeting an old friend and neighbor not long after, the talk\r\n     turned upon negro suffrage. I expressed myself in favor of that\r\n     measure, and timidly added, \"And go farther--I think women also\r\n     should vote.\" She grasped my hand cordially, saying, \"And so do\r\n     I!\" This was Mrs. Virginia L. Minor. We had each cherished this\r\n     opinion, supposing that no other woman in the community held it;\r\n     and this we afterwards found to have been the experience of many\r\n     others. This was in 1866; and in the following autumn Mrs. Minor\r\n     prepared and circulated for signatures a card of thanks to Hon.\r\n     B. Gratz Brown for the recognition of woman's political rights he\r\n     had given in the United States Senate in a speech upon extending\r\n     the suffrage to the women of the District of Columbia.[383] This\r\n     card received enough names to justify another step--that of a\r\n     petition to the Missouri General Assembly. This was headed by\r\n     Mrs. Minor, and circulated with untiring energy by her, receiving\r\n     several hundred signatures, and was sent to the legislature\r\n     during the winter, where it received some degree of favor.\r\n\r\n     But as yet no effort had been made toward an organization. The\r\n     first step in that direction was in May, 1867, by Mrs. Lucretia\r\n     P. Hall and her sister, Miss Penelope Allen, daughters of Mrs.\r\n     Beverly Allen, and nieces of General Pope, in the parlors of Mrs.\r\n     Anna L. Clapp, the president of the Union Aid Society during the\r\n     war. Mrs. Hall, Mrs. Clapp and myself called a public meeting on\r\n     May 8, when the Woman Suffrage Society of Missouri was organized,\r\n     with Mrs. Minor president.\r\n\r\n     In the winter of 1868 the association sent a large delegation of\r\n     ladies to Jefferson with a petition containing about 2,000 names,\r\n     to present to the legislature. The Republicans were then in the\r\n     ascendency, and the ladies having many professed friends among\r\n     the members, were received with every demonstration of respect.\r\n     Addresses were made by Miss Phoebe Couzins and Dr. Ada Greunan.\r\n     The petition was respectfully considered and a fair vote given\r\n     for the submission of an amendment.\r\n\r\n     Subsequent sessions of the legislature have been besieged, as was\r\n     also the constitutional convention in 1875; but beyond the\r\n     passage of several laws improving the general status of women, we\r\n     have not made much impression upon the law-making power of our\r\n     State; not so much since the State passed into the hands of the\r\n     Democrats, as while the Republicans were in the majority.\r\n\r\n     But the public meetings and social influence of our association\r\n     have done much for the cause of woman suffrage. Strangers are\r\n     surprised to find so little prejudice existing against a movement\r\n     so decidedly unpopular in many places. The convention held in St.\r\n     Louis in October, 1869, was one of the very best I have ever\r\n     known, and its influence was long felt for good. In the spring of\r\n     1871 our association became auxiliary to the American, and in\r\n     consequence several of our active members seceded, viz.: Mr. and\r\n     Mrs. Minor, Miss Couzins, Dr. Greunan and others. In the autumn\r\n     of 1872 the American Association held its annual meeting in St.\r\n     Louis.\r\n\r\n     The law school of Washington University has always been open to\r\n     women. Miss Couzins was the first to avail herself of its\r\n     advantages in 1869, though Miss Barkaloo of Brooklyn, denied\r\n     admission to Columbia Law School, soon joined her, and was\r\n     admitted to the bar in 1870. While Miss Barkaloo was not the\r\n     first woman admitted to the bar in the United States, she\r\n     doubtless was the first to try a case in court. She died after a\r\n     few months of most promising practice.[384] Miss Couzins was\r\n     admitted to the bar in May, 1871.\r\n\r\n     The St. Louis School of Design, which has done much for woman,\r\n     was originated by members of our association; principally by Mrs.\r\n     Mary F. Henderson, who has given untiring effort in that\r\n     direction. Our members were also instrumental in opening to women\r\n     the St. Louis Homeopathic Medical College, and active in opposing\r\n     what was known as the St. Louis \"Social Evil Law.\" They aided Dr.\r\n     Eliot in his valiant struggle against that iniquity. Mrs. E.\r\n     Patrick and myself called the first public meeting to protest\r\n     against the law. It was repealed March 27, 1874.\r\n\r\n     You are probably familiar with Mrs. Minor's suit to obtain\r\n     suffrage under the fourteenth amendment. We all admired her\r\n     courageous efforts for that object. Previous to that attempt our\r\n     society had earnestly advocated a sixteenth amendment for the\r\n     protection of woman's right to vote, but held the matter in\r\n     abeyance pending the suit. After its failure, we again renewed\r\n     our efforts for a sixteenth amendment, circulating and sending to\r\n     Washington our petitions. Our association holds monthly meetings\r\n     and proposes to continue the agitation.[385] I ought to say,\r\n     perhaps, that our society lends all the help possible to other\r\n     States. It gave $520 to Michigan in 1874, and $200 to Colorado in\r\n     1877.\r\n\r\n                                                       R. N. H.\r\n\r\n     To bring the question of woman's right as a citizen of the United\r\n     States to vote for United States officers before the judiciary,\r\n     Mrs. Minor attempted to register in order to vote at the national\r\n     election in November, 1872, and being refused on account of her\r\n     sex, brought the matter before the courts in the shape of a suit\r\n     against the registering officer.[386] The point was decided\r\n     adversely to her in all the courts, being finally reported in\r\n     Vol. 21 of Wallace's U. S. Supreme Court Reports. The importance\r\n     of this decision cannot be over-estimated. It affects every\r\n     citizen of the United States, male as well as female, if, as\r\n     there pronounced, the United States has no voters of its own\r\n     creation. The Dred-Scott decision is insignificant in comparison.\r\n     Mrs. Minor made the following points in her petition:\r\n\r\n          1. As a _citizen_ of the United States, the plaintiff is\r\n          entitled to any and all the \"privileges and immunities\" that\r\n          belong to such position however defined; and as are held,\r\n          exercised and enjoyed by other citizens of the United\r\n          States.\r\n\r\n          2. The elective franchise is a \"privilege\" of citizenship,\r\n          in the highest sense of the word. It is the privilege\r\n          preservative of all rights and privileges; and especially of\r\n          the right of the citizen to participate in his or her\r\n          government.\r\n\r\n          3. The denial or abridgment of this privilege, if it exist\r\n          at all, must be sought only in the fundamental charter of\r\n          government--the Constitution of the United States. If not\r\n          found there, no inferior power or jurisdiction can legally\r\n          claim the right to exercise it.\r\n\r\n          4. But the Constitution of the United States, so far from\r\n          recognizing or permitting any denial or abridgment of the\r\n          privileges of citizens, expressly declares that \"no State\r\n          shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the\r\n          privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n          5. It follows that the provisions of the Missouri\r\n          constitution and registry law before recited are in conflict\r\n          with, and must yield to the paramount authority of, the\r\n          Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n     At a mass meeting held in St. Louis January 25, 1875, a\r\n     committee[387] was appointed to prepare an address to the people\r\n     of the State, setting forth the necessity of such action by the\r\n     constitutional convention, soon to assemble, as would insure to\r\n     all citizens the right of choice in their lawmakers and in the\r\n     officers whose duty it should be to execute the laws. The address\r\n     was prepared and widely circulated over the State. In June, the\r\n     convention being in session at Jefferson, Mrs. Minor, Miss\r\n     Couzins, and Mrs. Dickinson went to the capitol and were granted\r\n     a gracious hearing, but no action was conceded.\r\n\r\n     In May, 1879, the National Woman Suffrage Association held its\r\n     annual meeting at St. Louis, holding its session through the day,\r\n     morning, afternoon and evening, and so much interest was aroused\r\n     that on May 13 a local society was organized under the head of\r\n     the National Woman Suffrage Association for St. Louis,[388] with\r\n     Mrs. Minor president, which has continued to do most efficient\r\n     service to the present. During the summer of 1879, Mrs. Minor\r\n     refused to pay the tax assessed against her:\r\n\r\n                                   ST. LOUIS, MO., August 26, 1879.\r\n\r\n          Hon. DAVID POWERS, _President Board of Assessors_: I\r\n          honestly believe and conscientiously make oath that I have\r\n          not one dollars' worth of property subject to taxation. The\r\n          principle upon which this government rests is representation\r\n          before taxation. My property is denied representation, and\r\n          therefore can not be taxable. The law which you quote as\r\n          applicable to me in your notice to make my tax return is in\r\n          direct conflict with section 30 of the bill of rights of the\r\n          constitution of the State which declares, \"No person shall\r\n          be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due\r\n          process of law,\" And that surely cannot be due process of\r\n          law wherein one of the parties only is law-maker, judge,\r\n          jury and executioner, and the other stands silenced, denied\r\n          the power either of assent or dissent, a condition of\r\n          \"involuntary slavery\" so clearly prohibited in section 31 of\r\n          the same article, as well as in the Constitution of the\r\n          United States, that no legislation or judicial prejudice can\r\n          ignore it. I trust you will believe it is from no disrespect\r\n          to you that I continue to refuse to become a party to this\r\n          injustice by making a return of property to your honorable\r\n          body, as clearly the duties of a citizen can only be exacted\r\n          where rights and privileges are equally accorded.\r\n\r\n                                   Respectfully,     VIRGINIA L. MINOR.\r\n\r\n     Again, in February, 1881, Mrs. Minor made an able argument before\r\n     the legislative committee on constitutional amendments in support\r\n     of the petition for the enfranchisement of the women of the\r\n     State. Her pivotal point was, \"By whatever tenure you, as\r\n     one-half of the people, hold it, we, the other half, claim it by\r\n     the same.\" And again in December of the same year at a meeting of\r\n     the Knights and Ladies of the Father Matthew Debating Club, at\r\n     which the subject was, \"Is the woman's rights movement to be\r\n     encouraged?\" Patrick Long, Daniel O'Connel Tracy, Richard D.\r\n     Kerwen, spoke in the affirmative; several gentlemen and two\r\n     ladies in opposition, when Mrs. Minor, who was in the audience,\r\n     was called out amid great applause, to which she responded in an\r\n     able speech, showing that the best temperance weapon in the hands\r\n     of woman is the ballot.\r\n\r\nOf the initial steps taken for the elevation of women in the little\r\nvillage of Oregon, Mrs. Annie R. Irvine writes:\r\n\r\n     The Woman's Union, an independent literary club, designed to\r\n     improve the mental, moral, and physical condition of women, held\r\n     its first meeting in Oregon, Holt county, on the evening of\r\n     January 6, 1872, at the residence of Dr. Asher Goslin. Temporary\r\n     officers were elected, and a committee appointed to prepare\r\n     by-laws for the government of the club. Six ladies[389] were\r\n     present. The succeeding meetings grew in interest, and took\r\n     strong hold upon the minds of all classes, from the fact that\r\n     hitherto no outlet had been found for the energies of our women\r\n     outside the circle of home and church. During the first two years\r\n     of its existence, the Woman's Union had to bear in a small way,\r\n     many of the sneers and taunts attending more pretentious\r\n     organizations, but luckily, when the novelty wore off, we were\r\n     allowed to pursue the quiet tenor of our way, with an occasional\r\n     slur at the \"strong-minded\" tendency of the organization. During\r\n     nearly fourteen years we have held regular meetings in a hall\r\n     rented for the purpose, and paid for by earnings of the society.\r\n     An excellent organ is owned by the club; they have a library of\r\n     several hundred volumes, book-cases, carpet, curtains, pictures,\r\n     tables, chairs, stove, etc., and the members take great pride in\r\n     their cosy headquarters. At this writing, interesting meetings\r\n     are held on each Wednesday evening at the homes of the different\r\n     members of the society.[390] In the course of so long a time,\r\n     this organization has had many changes. Members have removed to\r\n     all parts of the United States, and many similar clubs elsewhere\r\n     trace their origin to our society.\r\n\r\n     Several years ago an open letter from here to \"Woman's Kingdom,\"\r\n     in the Chicago _Inter-Ocean_ called attention to our plan of work\r\n     for small towns; as a result fifteen similar Unions were\r\n     organized, some of them still flourishing. In northwest Missouri\r\n     the same kind of clubs were formed in Maryville, Nodaway county,\r\n     and Savannah, Andrew county, but neither of them became\r\n     permanent. In the course of twelve years many of the best\r\n     speakers on the American platform have addressed Oregon\r\n     audiences, brought here by the determined efforts of a few women.\r\n     To-day, public opinion in this part of Missouri is in advance of\r\n     other sections on all questions relating to the great interests\r\n     of humanity. In March, 1879, a call signed by prominent\r\n     citizens[391] brought together a large assembly of men and women\r\n     in the court-house. An address in favor of woman suffrage was\r\n     delivered by Rev. John Wayman of the M. E. Church of St. Joseph.\r\n     Mr. James L. Allen acted as chairman of the meeting, and a\r\n     society was then organized, to bear the name of the Holt County\r\n     Woman Suffrage Society. At the National Woman Suffrage Convention\r\n     held at St. Louis later in the same year, Jas. L. Allen acted as\r\n     delegate from this association and reported our progress. The\r\n     best organized woman's society in the State is probably the\r\n     Women's Christian Temperance Union. In its different departments,\r\n     although hampered by too much theological red tape, it is\r\n     reaching thousands of ignorant, prejudiced, good sectarian women\r\n     who would expect the \"heavens to fall\" if they accidentally got\r\n     into a meeting where \"woman's rights\" was mentioned even in a\r\n     whisper. Mrs. Clara Hoffman, of Kansas City, is State president,\r\n     and a woman of great force. She, as well as other leading lights\r\n     in the Women's Christian Temperance Union, is strongly advocating\r\n     woman suffrage as a _sine qua non_ in the temperance work. The\r\n     women of this part of the State have been given quite a prominent\r\n     place among organizations mentioned in a late \"History of\r\n     Missouri, by Counties.\" The Woman's Union has taken the place of\r\n     honor.[392] From the very outset we have had the most bitter and\r\n     persistent opposition from the churches, more particularly the\r\n     Presbyterian, although some of our most capable members were of\r\n     that faith. Exceptions should be made in favor of the Christian,\r\n     or Campbellite, and as a general thing, the M. E. churches. The\r\n     greatest shock we have had to resist, however, came a few months\r\n     since in the shape of a division among our own members, and has\r\n     really discouraged the more independent among us more than\r\n     anything else. The W. C. T. U. sent their Mascatine organizer\r\n     here, to wake up the women in the interests of the State society.\r\n     Although ignorant and prejudiced, he created a fanatical\r\n     stampede, and in the goodness of their hearts and the weakness of\r\n     their heads, our church women in the Woman's Union proposed to\r\n     give to the three temperance clubs, numbering perhaps 150, the\r\n     free use of our rooms and property, and suspend our own club,\r\n     claiming that our mission was ended, and that a field of greater\r\n     usefulness was opened in the W. C. T. U. line of work. The\r\n     liberal element refused to abandon the old organization, although\r\n     many joined in the W. C. T. U. work and attended both clubs.\r\n\r\n     However, in a small community, where the consciences of many good\r\n     women are not free, we have met with serious drawbacks. We have\r\n     had to submit to a sort of boycotting process, for some time, the\r\n     orthodox, goody-goody people evidently trying to freeze us out;\r\n     although I must claim that nearly every member of the Woman's\r\n     Union is strongly interested in the temperance cause, and as the\r\n     different departments in the W. C. T. U. fail to cover the ground\r\n     we occupy, quite a respectable number seem determined to hold on\r\n     in their own way, trying little by little to better the condition\r\n     of all, and particularly to increase and strengthen the feeble\r\n     germ of independent thought in women, so often smothered and\r\n     destroyed by too much theology. What we need for women is not\r\n     more spirituality but more hard common-sense, applied to reform\r\n     as well as religion. One thing connected with our organization is\r\n     a matter of pride to all women, namely, that no pecuniary\r\n     obligation has ever been repudiated by the Woman's Union. Besides\r\n     paying our debts we have given hundreds of dollars to works of\r\n     charity and education, and keep a standing fund of $100, to be\r\n     used in case of emergency, when, as often happens, we fail to\r\n     make expenses on lectures, entertainments, etc. It would not be\r\n     claiming too much if the Woman's Union of Oregon was to go upon\r\n     the historic page as the only free, independent woman's club ever\r\n     successfully carried on for any length of time, in the great\r\n     State of Missouri.[393]\r\n\r\nMissouri has always felt a becoming pride in the gifted daughter,\r\nMiss Phoebe Couzins, who was the first woman to enter the law\r\nschool, go through the entire course, and graduate with honor to\r\nherself and her native State. Hence, a reception to her, to mark\r\nsuch an event, was preeminently fitting. This compliment was paid\r\nto her by Dr. and Mrs. G. A. Walker, and a large gathering of the\r\nelite of St. Louis honored her with their presence.[394] The\r\ndrawing-rooms were festooned with garlands of evergreens and\r\nbrilliant forest leaves and hanging-baskets of roses; the bountiful\r\ntables were elaborately decorated with fruits and flowers and\r\nstatuettes, while pictures of distinguished women looked down from\r\nthe wall on every side. After the feast came letters, toasts and\r\nspeeches, a brilliant address of welcome was given by Dr. Walker,\r\nand an equally brilliant reply by Miss Couzins. Witty and\r\ncomplimentary speeches were made by Judge Krum, Hon. Albert Todd,\r\nMrs. Francis Minor, ex-Governor Stanard, Judge Reber, Professor\r\nRiley, I. E. Meeker, Mrs. Henrietta Noa. Congratulatory letters\r\nwere received from several ladies and gentlemen of national\r\nreputation, and the following regrets:\r\n\r\n     Rev. W. G. Eliot, chancellor of the University, with \"compliments\r\n     and thanks to Dr. and Mrs. Walker. I regret that engagements this\r\n     evening prevent me from enjoying the pleasure of meeting Miss\r\n     Couzins and welcoming her to her new and well-deserved honors, as\r\n     I had expected to do until an hour ago.\"\r\n\r\n     James E. Yeatman sent regrets accompanied with \"his warmest\r\n     congratulations to Miss Couzins, with best wishes for her success\r\n     in the noble profession of the law.\"\r\n\r\n     George Partridge regrets, \"hoping every encouragement will be\r\n     given to those who aspire to high honors by their intellectual\r\n     and moral attainments.\"\r\n\r\n     General J. H. Hammond, Kansas City, Mo.: \"I would feel honored in\r\n     being allowed the privilege of congratulating this lady who so\r\n     practically honors her sex.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the many congratulations showered upon Miss Couzins,\r\nshe was the recipient of testimonials of a more enduring and\r\nequally flattering character. Among many valuable presents were\r\ntwelve volumes of Edmund Burke from Miss A. L. Forbes, who wished\r\nto testify her appreciation of the event by deeds rather than\r\nwords. Mrs. E. O. Stanard presented a handsomely-bound set of\r\n\"Erskine's Speeches,\" in five volumes.\r\n\r\nThere were other gifts of great intrinsic worth. These tokens of\r\nregard were sent from admiring friends scattered all over the\r\ncountry, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nAlthough Miss Couzins has never practiced in her chosen profession,\r\nyet the knowledge and discipline acquired in the study of our\r\nAmerican system of jurisprudence and constitutional law have been\r\nof essential service to her in the prolonged arguments on the\r\nenfranchisement of woman, in which she has so ably and eloquently\r\nadvocated the case of the great plaintiff of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, in that famous law-suit begun by Margaret Fuller in 1840,\r\n\"Woman versus Man.\" Our junior advocate has taken the case into the\r\nhighest courts and made her appeals to a jury of the sovereign\r\npeople and \"the judgment of a candid world.\" On all principles of\r\nprecedent and importance our case now stands first on the calendar.\r\nWhen will the verdict be rendered and what will it be?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[377] Among them were Isaac H.

It is\r\nsignificant of the sentiment of the Methodist women of the West:\r\n\"We, the undersigned, join in a call for a mass-meeting of the M.E.\r\nChurch in St. Louis, to meet at Union Church on the 15th inst., at\r\n3 o'clock P.M., to consider a plan for memorializing the General\r\nConference to permit the ordination of women as ministers.

Wondering\r\nas to the character of the people I should find, we jolted round\r\nthe town to the home of the editor and his charming wife, Mrs. Lucy\r\nS. Rancher. Their cordial welcome and generous hospitalities soon\r\nmade the old stage, the rough roads, and the dull town but dim\r\nmemories of the past. One after another the members of the Union\r\nclub came to greet me, and I saw in that organization of strong,\r\nnoble women, wisdom enough to redeem the whole State of Missouri\r\nfrom its apathy on the question of woman's rights. One of the\r\npromising features of the efforts of the immortal six women who\r\ntook the initiative, was the full sympathy shown by their husbands\r\nin their attempts to improve themselves and the community. Miss\r\nCouzins and Miss Anthony soon followed me, and were alike surprised\r\nand delighted with the Literary Club of Oregon. I was there again\r\nin '77, and was entertained by Mrs. R. A. Norman, now living in St.\r\nJoseph, and in '79, I stayed in a large, old-fashioned brick house\r\nnear the public square with Mrs. Montgomery, then \"fat, fair and\r\nforty,\" and all three visits, with the teas and dinners at the\r\nhomes of different members of the club, I thoroughly enjoyed.--[E.\r\nC.

The motto on the great seal of\r\nthe State, \"Our liberties we prize and our rights we will\r\nmaintain,\" is the key-note to the successive struggles made there\r\nto build up a community of moral, virtuous, intelligent people,\r\nsecuring justice, liberty and equality to all. Iowa has been the\r\nState to give large Republican majorities; to prohibit the\r\nmanufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors by a constitutional\r\namendment; and to present propositions before her legislature for\r\neight successive sessions to give the right of suffrage to woman.\r\nIn the article on Iowa, in the American Cyclopaedia, the writer\r\nsays: \"No distinction is made in law between the husband and the\r\nwife in regard to property. One-third in value of all the real\r\nestate of either, upon the death of the other, goes to the survivor\r\nin fee simple. Neither is liable for the separate debts of the\r\nother. The wife may make contracts and incur liabilities which may\r\nbe enforced by or against her in the same manner as if she was\r\nunmarried; and so a married woman may sue and be sued without the\r\nhusband being joined in the action.\" Many women living in Iowa\r\noften quote these laws with pride, showing the liberality of their\r\nrulers as far as they go. But in new countries the number of women\r\nthat inherit property is very small compared to the number that\r\nwork all their days to help pay for their humble homes. It is in\r\nthe right to these joint earnings where the wife is most cruelly\r\ndefrauded, because the mother of a large family, who washes, irons,\r\ncooks, bakes, patches and darns, takes care of the children, labors\r\nfrom early dawn to midnight in her own home, is not supposed to\r\nearn anything, hence owns nothing, and all the labors of a long\r\nlife, the results of her thrift and economy, belong absolutely to\r\nthe husband, so that when he dies they call it liberality for the\r\nhusband to make his partner an heir, and give her one-third of\r\ntheir joint earnings.\r\n\r\nFor this chapter we are indebted to Mrs. Amelia Bloomer, who moved\r\ninto this State from New York in the spring of 1855 with her\r\nhusband, who commenced the practice of law in Council Bluffs, where\r\nthey have resided ever since. Mrs. Bloomer had been the editor for\r\nseveral years of a weekly paper called the _Lily_, which advocated\r\nboth temperance and woman's rights, and for the six years of its\r\npublication was of inestimable value alike to both reforms. She was\r\none of the earliest champions of the woman's rights movement, and\r\nas writer, editor and lecturer, did much to forward the cause in\r\nits infancy.[395]\r\n\r\n     The first agitation of the question of woman suffrage in Iowa was\r\n     in the summer of 1854, when Frances Dana Gage of Ohio gave a\r\n     series of lectures in the southeastern section of the State on\r\n     temperance and woman's rights. Letters written to _Lily_ at the\r\n     time show that large audiences congregated to see and hear a\r\n     woman publicly proclaiming the wrongs of her sex, and demanding\r\n     equal rights before the law. During the year 1855 the writer gave\r\n     several lectures at Council Bluffs, and in January, 1856, by\r\n     invitation, addressed the second territorial legislature of\r\n     Nebraska, in Representative Hall, Omaha; and in the year\r\n     following lectured in Council Bluffs, Omaha, Nebraska City,\r\n     Glenwood and other towns.\r\n\r\n     In 1868 Mrs. Martha H. Brinkerhoff made a very successful\r\n     lecture-tour through the northern counties of Iowa. She roused\r\n     great interest and organized many societies, canvassing meanwhile\r\n     for subscribers to _The Revolution_. In the same year Mrs. Annie\r\n     C. Savery gave a lecture for the benefit of a blind editor at Des\r\n     Moines. In February, 1870, by invitation, she responded to a\r\n     toast at a Masonic festival in that city; and during that and the\r\n     year following she lectured in several places on woman suffrage,\r\n     and wrote many able articles for the press.\r\n\r\n     On April 17, 1869, the \"Northern Woman Suffrage Association\" was\r\n     organized at Dubuque.[396] This was the first society in Iowa,\r\n     though about the same time others were being organized in\r\n     different localities. J. L. McCreery, in his editorial position,\r\n     advocated the enfranchisement of woman, and wrote an able paper\r\n     in favor of the object of the organization. Mrs. Mary N. Adams\r\n     opened a correspondence with friends of the movement in other\r\n     parts of the State; Henry O'Connor, Mary A. Livermore and others\r\n     lectured before the society, thus educating the people into a\r\n     better understanding of woman's rights and needs. Mrs. Adams not\r\n     only addressed the home society, but gave lectures before lyceums\r\n     and educational institutions.\r\n\r\n     Des Moines has always maintained the most successful organization\r\n     having a band of earnest women enlisted in the work, and being\r\n     the capital of the State, where every opportunity was afforded to\r\n     facilitate their efforts. The liberality of the press, too, aided\r\n     vastly in moulding public sentiment in favor of the cause. About\r\n     the earliest work done in that city was in June, 1870, when\r\n     Hannah Tracy Cutler and Amelia Bloomer (immediately on returning\r\n     from the formation of the State Society at Mt. Pleasant) held two\r\n     meetings there--one in the open air on the grounds where the new\r\n     capitol now stands, on the question of temperance, Sunday\r\n     afternoon, presided over by Governor Merrill; the other in the\r\n     Baptist Church, on woman suffrage, the following evening, Mrs.\r\n     Annie C. Savery presiding.\r\n\r\n     The Polk County Woman Suffrage Society was formed October 25, and\r\n     has never failed to hold its meetings regularly each month since\r\n     that time. Every congress and every legislature have been\r\n     appealed to by petitions signed by thousands of the best\r\n     citizens, and it is on record that the senators and\r\n     representatives of Polk county, with one exception,[397] have\r\n     always voted in favor of submitting the question of woman's\r\n     enfranchisement to the electors of the State. When men are talked\r\n     of for legislative honors they are interviewed by a committee\r\n     from the society, and pledges secured that they will vote \"aye\"\r\n     on any woman suffrage bill that may come before them.\r\n\r\n     This society has from time to time engaged the services of\r\n     prominent lecturers,[398] and nearly all of the ministers and\r\n     lawyers of the city have given addresses in favor of the cause.\r\n     Only one minister has openly and bitterly opposed the measure,\r\n     and his sermon on the \"Subordination of Woman,\" published in the\r\n     _Register_, called out spirited replies from Mrs. Savery and Mrs.\r\n     Bloomer in the same journal, which completely demolished the\r\n     flimsy fancies of the gentleman.\r\n\r\n     About 1874 Mrs. Maria Orwig edited a column in the _Record_, and\r\n     Mary A. Work a column in the _Republican_. Since 1880, Mesdames\r\n     Hunter, Orwig, Woods and Work have filled two columns in _The\r\n     Prohibitionist_, of which Laura A. Berry is one of the editors.\r\n     Mrs. M. J. Coggeshall has for several years served the society as\r\n     reporter for the _Register_, proving herself a very ready and\r\n     interesting writer. All of these ladies are efficient and\r\n     untiring in whatever pertains to woman's interest.[399] The\r\n     _Register_ says:\r\n\r\n          The field of labor in Des Moines is pretty well occupied by\r\n          the ladies. You will find them at the desks in the county\r\n          and United States court-houses, in the pension office, in\r\n          the insurance office, in the State offices, behind the\r\n          counters in stores, in attorneys' offices--and there is one\r\n          woman who assists her husband at the blacksmith's trade, and\r\n          she can strike as hard a blow with a sledge as the brawniest\r\n          workman in the shop.\r\n\r\n     In the autumn of 1870 a society was organized at Burlington, with\r\n     fifty members. One of the earliest advocates of the cause in this\r\n     place was Mary A. P. Darwin, president of the association, who\r\n     lectured through the southern tier of counties during the summer\r\n     of 1870. She was an earnest and forcible speaker.\r\n\r\n     At Oskaloosa the opening work was done in 1854 by Frances D.\r\n     Gage, who gave four lectures there, and roused the people to\r\n     thought and discussion. Mattie Griffith Davenport has long filled\r\n     a prominent place in the woman suffrage movement in that city.\r\n     She commenced lecturing in 1868, and during that and the two\r\n     succeeding years traveled over much of the State, speaking upon\r\n     temperance and woman's rights. During 1879 she edited a column of\r\n     the Davenport _News_ in the interest of suffrage. In the summer\r\n     of 1870 Mrs. Cutler and Mrs. Bloomer held two meetings in\r\n     Oskaloosa, in one of which a gentleman engaged in the\r\n     discussions, and as is usual in such encounters, the women having\r\n     right and justice on their side, came out the victors; at least\r\n     so said the listeners. Following this a Woman's Suffrage Society\r\n     was organized.[400] Many prominent speakers lectured here in\r\n     turn, and helped to keep up the interest.\r\n\r\n     Council Bluffs also organized a society[401] in 1870, holding\r\n     frequent meetings and sociables. There is here a large element in\r\n     favor of the ballot for woman; and though we are unfortunate in\r\n     not having an advocate in the press, still Council Bluffs will\r\n     give a good report of itself when the question of woman's\r\n     enfranchisement shall come before the electors for action. The\r\n     trustees of the public library of this city are women; the\r\n     librarian is a woman: the post-office is in the hands of a woman;\r\n     the teachers in the public schools, with one or two exceptions,\r\n     are women; the principal of the high school is a woman; and a\r\n     large number of the clerks in the dry goods stores are women.\r\n     Miss Ingelletta Smith received the nomination of the Republican\r\n     party for school superintendent in the fall of 1881, but was\r\n     defeated by her Democratic competitor.\r\n\r\n     Marshalltown had a suffrage organization as early as July,\r\n     1870.[402] Nettie Sanford lectured in several of the central\r\n     counties of the State during that and the previous year.\r\n     Josephine Guthrie, professor of Belles-Lettres at Le Grand\r\n     College, in a series of able articles in the Marshalltown _Times_\r\n     in 1869, claimed for women equality of rights before the law. In\r\n     1873, Aubie Gifford, a woman of high culture and an experienced\r\n     teacher, was elected to the office of county superintendent of\r\n     the public schools of Marshall county, by a handsome majority;\r\n     she was reelected, serving, in all, four years.\r\n\r\n     At Algona a society[403] was formed in 1871. At the annual\r\n     meeting of the State Society at Des Moines, in 1873, Lizzie B.\r\n     Read delivered an address entitled, \"Coming Up Out of the\r\n     Wilderness,\" and in July, 1875, at a mass-meeting at Clear Lake,\r\n     one on \"The Bible in Favor of Woman Suffrage.\" Mrs. Read,\r\n     formerly as Miss Bunnel, published a paper called the\r\n     _Mayflower_, at Peru, Indiana, and in 1865 a county paper in this\r\n     State called the _Upper Des Moines_.\r\n\r\n     Since 1875 Jackson county has had an efficient Equal Rights\r\n     Society.[404] On July 4, 1876, Nancy R. Allen, at the general\r\n     celebration at Maquoketa, the county-seat, read the \"Protest and\r\n     Declaration of Rights,\" issued by the National Association from\r\n     its Centennial Parlors in Philadelphia. It was well received by\r\n     the majority of the people assembled; but, as usual, there were\r\n     some objectors. The Presbyterian minister published a series of\r\n     articles in the _Sentinel_, to each of which Mrs. Allen replied\r\n     ably defending the principles of the Woman Suffrage party. The\r\n     Maquoketa Equal Rights Society celebrated the thirtieth\r\n     anniversary of the woman's rights movement July 19, 1878, by\r\n     holding a public meeting in Dr. Allen's grounds, in the shade of\r\n     the grand old trees. It was a large gathering, and many prominent\r\n     gentlemen of the city, by their presence and words of cheer, gave\r\n     dignity to the occasion. Jackson county has long honored women\r\n     with positions of trust. The deputy recorder is a woman; Mrs.\r\n     Allen was notary public; Mrs. Patton was nominated for auditor by\r\n     the Greenback party in 1880, but was defeated with the rest of\r\n     the ticket. Women are book-keepers, merchants, clerks, teachers;\r\n     and, in fact, almost every avenue is open to them.\r\n\r\n     Of Fort Dodge, Mrs. Haviland writes: \"The subject has never been\r\n     much agitated here. I have stood almost alone these long years,\r\n     watching the work done by my sisters in other parts of the State,\r\n     and hoping the time would soon come when some move could be made\r\n     in this place. Last spring the annual meeting of our State\r\n     Society was held here, but it was with difficulty that I found\r\n     places where the few who came could be entertained, people were\r\n     so afraid of woman's rights. After the refusal of the other\r\n     churches, the Baptists opened theirs; the crowd of curious ones\r\n     looked on and seemed surprised when they failed to discover the\r\n     'horns.'\" Mrs. A.M. Swain also writes: \"Miss Anthony came here\r\n     first in June, 1871, and has been here twice since. Mrs.\r\n     Swisshelm was here in 1874. Both were my guests when no other\r\n     doors were open to the advocates of woman suffrage. The late\r\n     convention of the State Society held here was a decided success;\r\n     the best class of ladies attended; the dignity and ability shown\r\n     in the management, and the many interesting and logical papers\r\n     read disarmed all criticism and awakened genuine interest. I have\r\n     handed in my ballot for several years, but it has never been\r\n     received or counted.\"\r\n\r\n     Societies were organized in 1869 and 1870, in Independence and\r\n     Monticello. Humboldt, Nevada, West Union, Corning, Osceola,\r\n     Muscatine, Sigourney, Garden Grove, Decorah, Hamburg, and scores\r\n     of other towns have their local societies. At West Liberty Mrs.\r\n     Mary V. Cowgill and her good husband are liberal contributors to\r\n     the work, both State and National.\r\n\r\n     At a convention held at Mt. Pleasant, June 17, 18, 1870,\r\n     different sections of the State being well represented, the Iowa\r\n     Woman Suffrage Society[405] was formed. Belle Mansfield,\r\n     president, Frank Hatton,[406] editor of the Mt. Pleasant\r\n     _Journal_, secretary. W.R. Cole opened the convention with\r\n     prayer. After many able addresses from various speakers,[407] in\r\n     response to an invitation from the president, Judge Palmer in a\r\n     somewhat excited manner stated his objections to woman's voting.\r\n     He wanted some guarantee that good would result from giving her\r\n     the ballot. He thought \"she did not understand driving, and would\r\n     upset the sleigh. Men had always rowed the boat, and therefore\r\n     always should. Men had more force and muscle than women, and\r\n     therefore should have all the power in their hands.\" He spoke of\r\n     himself as the guardian of his wife, and said she did not want to\r\n     vote. After talking an hour in this style, he took his seat,\r\n     greatly to the relief of his hearers. Mrs. Cutler, in her calm,\r\n     dignified, deliberate manner, answered his arguments. She proved\r\n     conclusively that muscular force was not the power most needed in\r\n     our government. If it were, all the little, weak men and women,\r\n     no matter how intellectual must stand aside, and let only the\r\n     strong, muscular do the voting and governing. In clearness of\r\n     perception, and readiness of debate, she distanced her opponent\r\n     altogether in the opinion of the convention.\r\n\r\n     The first annual meeting of the State Society was held at Des\r\n     Moines, October 19, 1871. Mrs. Bloomer presided[408] in the\r\n     absence of the president, Gen. O'Connor. Speakers had been\r\n     engaged for this convention, a good representation secured, and\r\n     every arrangement made for a successful meeting. And such it was,\r\n     barring a difference of opinion among the friends of the movement\r\n     as to what questions should properly come before a society whose\r\n     only object, as declared in its constitution, was to secure\r\n     suffrage for women. The following letters were received:\r\n\r\n                                   IOWA CITY, October 11, 1871.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. ANNIE SAVERY--_Dear Madam_: Your kind and very\r\n          flattering invitation to address the Woman's State Suffrage\r\n          Convention, in Des Moines, reached me just prior to my\r\n          departure for this city, and I avail myself of my first\r\n          leisure to respond. It would not only give me great\r\n          pleasure, but I should esteem it among my higher duties to\r\n          accept your invitation, and give my emphatic endorsement to\r\n          the great reform movement represented by the woman suffrage\r\n          convention, were it at all practicable. But I have just\r\n          reached my new charge, and can not dispose of immediate\r\n          pressing claims upon my time and effort here. Please accept\r\n          my apology for declining, and believe me, ever yours for\r\n          woman's enfranchisement.\r\n\r\n                                             C. R. POMEROY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       INDIANOLA, Sept. 30, 1871.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. ANNIE SAVERY--_Madam_: I am in receipt of your letter,\r\n          asking me to take part in your annual convention. I thank\r\n          you for the honor, as I expect from such a convention\r\n          results the most salutary, not only to the condition of\r\n          woman, but also to the progress of our young and vigorous\r\n          commonwealth. I have read carefully the circular enclosed in\r\n          your letter, and consider the logic irrefutable, and its\r\n          suggestions well worthy the attention of all who desire the\r\n          complete enfranchisement of woman. I fear that I shall not\r\n          be able to attend, but if I am, I shall be with you, should\r\n          I do no more than say \"Amen\" to the words of my eloquent\r\n          countryman, O'Connor, whom I learn you have honored with the\r\n          presidency of your association. Wishing for your cause the\r\n          fullest success, I subscribe myself--one for the\r\n          enfranchisement of woman.\r\n\r\n                                             ALEXANDER BURNS.\r\n\r\n     A letter was also received from Bishop Matthew Simpson, of the\r\n     Methodist church, who was always ready to declare his adherence\r\n     to this great reform:\r\n\r\n                                   OWATOMA, Oct. 2, 1871.\r\n\r\n          Hon. J. HARLAN--_Dear Senator_: Yours, inclosing Mrs.\r\n          Savery's kind invitation, was received before I left\r\n          Mankota. I would be pleased to comply with her invitation,\r\n          joined as it is with your earnest solicitation. But I am\r\n          under bonds--if not to keep the peace, at least to keep\r\n          silence--so far as either sermons or public addresses are\r\n          concerned, until the full restoration of my health. I am\r\n          glad to say my health is improving. I have presided at five\r\n          conferences this fall--two still await me. But I have not\r\n          ventured any extra labor, nor dare I for some time to come.\r\n          Please convey to Mrs. Savery my thanks for her kind\r\n          invitation, and say to her that I sympathize fully with the\r\n          suffrage association in its desire to attain for women the\r\n          ballot.\r\n\r\n     A series of resolutions was discussed, other letters read, and a\r\n     large number of new converts joined the association. The _State\r\n     Register_ spoke in a very complimentary manner of the\r\n     deliberations of this convention:\r\n\r\n          It is but just, perhaps, that we should say, in general\r\n          terms, of the State woman suffrage convention, in session in\r\n          Des Moines the past week, that its proceedings were\r\n          characterized with good sense, dignity, and the best of\r\n          order. The world has had an impression for five or six\r\n          thousand years that women cannot talk without wrangling,\r\n          counsel without confusion. Again, many are so unjust as to\r\n          imagine that a convention composed of ladies, assembled to\r\n          discuss serious subjects, can be nothing more than a\r\n          quilting party or tattlers' club enlarged and let loose.\r\n\r\n          We have never seen a convention conducted with more decorum,\r\n          or a greater degree of intelligent accord exhibited in the\r\n          routine of proceedings, than was noticeable in this first\r\n          annual gathering of the friends of suffrage in Iowa. A\r\n          majority of the members were women. They opened the\r\n          convention and conducted the discussions with a spirit and\r\n          in a manner after which men might well pattern. In some\r\n          respects, the ladies who took the lead, showed themselves\r\n          better posted in general information, in all matters of\r\n          deliberation, than men.\r\n\r\n          We would not endorse all that was done at the convention,\r\n          but we would be fair enough to give to it the meed of having\r\n          been, in all respects, well conducted. The convention\r\n          strengthened those in whose name it met, not only among\r\n          themselves, but with the public. All who attended it were\r\n          impressed with the conviction that its members were earnest\r\n          and honest, and could see that they were intelligent and\r\n          well armed. Whatever it may have done directly, and that we\r\n          know was much, it accomplished more good for its cause by\r\n          impressing the public mind that its adherents in Iowa are\r\n          banded together in union, and bound to make every honorable\r\n          effort for success.\r\n\r\n     In January, 1872, I received a letter from a very prominent\r\n     member of the legislature, from which the following is an\r\n     extract:\r\n\r\n          After consultation I believe the House would resolve itself\r\n          into committee of the whole (when senators would be likely\r\n          also to come in), and hear you on the question of woman\r\n          suffrage. Should you desire to press it to vote this\r\n          session, I should advise that course. As to the time of your\r\n          hearing, it should be in the day, and appointed soon after\r\n          the recess. We meet again on February 13. I think it could\r\n          be arranged for Friday, the 16th, if agreeable to you. With\r\n          kind regards,\r\n\r\n                                             JOHN A. KASSON.\r\n\r\n     Notwithstanding this kind proposal of Mr. Kasson, I did not act\r\n     upon his suggestion. But Mrs. Harbert and Mrs. Savery, feeling\r\n     that something must be done, had the courage and the conscience,\r\n     on their individual responsibility, to call a mass-meeting at the\r\n     capitol on the evening previous to the day appointed for the vote\r\n     on the amendment in the House. Mrs. Harbert presided and opened\r\n     the meeting with an earnest appeal; Mrs. Savery, Mr. C.P. Holmes,\r\n     Senator Converse, and Governor Carpenter, made eloquent speeches.\r\n     The governor, in opening his address said he voted to strike\r\n     \"black\" from the constitution sixteen years ago, and would then,\r\n     as now, had the opportunity been presented, have voted to strike\r\n     out \"male.\"\r\n\r\n     On the following day when the amendment came up in the House for\r\n     the final vote, it was carried by 58 to 39. In the Senate there\r\n     was a spirited discussion, Hon. Charles Beardsley making an\r\n     earnest speech in favor of the resolution. The vote on engrossing\r\n     the bill for the third reading stood 26 ayes to 20 nays. Hope\r\n     ran high with the friends; but alas! on a final vote, taken but a\r\n     few minutes later, the bill was lost by 24 nays to 22 ayes.[409]\r\n     The general sentiment was well stated by the Iowa _State\r\n     Register_:\r\n\r\n          The Senate disposed of the woman suffrage question yesterday\r\n          by voting it down. We think it made a mistake. Certainly\r\n          there was, at the lowest count, thirty out of every hundred\r\n          voters in the State who desired to have this legislature\r\n          ratify the action of the last Assembly, and submit the\r\n          question at the polls this fall. The Republican party has\r\n          its own record to meet here. The first time the negro\r\n          suffrage question was submitted to the people of Iowa, it\r\n          was submitted by a Republican legislature, and the\r\n          submission was made when not over one voter in a hundred\r\n          desired it done. This latter thing was a plain proposition,\r\n          a most justly preferred petition. The people who were\r\n          anxious to have the question submitted, are, it is\r\n          confidently claimed, in majority. We think their wishes\r\n          might well and fitly have been granted. Even those who were\r\n          opposed to them must see that the advocates of the reform\r\n          will now have a chance to claim that the opponents of it are\r\n          afraid to go with them to the people. This is not merely a\r\n          defeat for the present year, but practically for four years.\r\n          Our State constitution can be amended only after two\r\n          legislatures have acted upon the amendment, and the people\r\n          have voted upon it. The legislature of two years ago passed\r\n          the resolution voted down yesterday. Now, we presume, it\r\n          will have to take another start. Four years of waiting and\r\n          working before the friends of the reform can be given a\r\n          chance to get a verdict from the people, is a long and\r\n          painful ordeal. It will not be endured with patience. It\r\n          would be asking too much of human nature to expect that.\r\n\r\n     At the annual convention of 1874, at Des Moines, Bishop Gilbert\r\n     Haven of the Methodist Episcopal Church, a clear and liberal\r\n     thinker, made a very impressive speech on the power woman could\r\n     wield with the ballot in her own hand in making our towns and\r\n     cities safe for our sons and daughters to live in. This year, the\r\n     Des Moines annual conference of the M. E. Church passed\r\n     resolutions advocating woman suffrage as a great moral reform;\r\n     while the State convention of the Universalist Association in its\r\n     resolution said: \"This convention recognizes that women are\r\n     entitled to all the social, religious, and political rights which\r\n     men enjoy.\"\r\n\r\n     At the Diocesan Convention held at Davenport May 1881, the\r\n     Episcopal Church took a step forward by striking the word male\r\n     out of a canon, thus enabling women to vote for vestrymen, a\r\n     right hitherto withheld. It is but a straw in the right\r\n     direction, but \"straws show which way the wind blows,\" and we may\r\n     hope for more good things to follow.\r\n\r\n     The Republican party, in convention assembled, at Des Moines,\r\n     July 1, 1874, inserted the following, as the tenth plank of its\r\n     platform:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That since the people may be entrusted with all\r\n          questions of governmental reform, we favor the final\r\n          submission to them of the question of amending the\r\n          constitution so as to extend the right of suffrage to women,\r\n          pursuant to the action of the fifteenth General Assembly.\r\n\r\n     The reading of the resolution called forth cheers of approval,\r\n     and was adopted without a dissenting vote, Mrs. Elizabeth Boynton\r\n     Harbert is entitled to great credit for this \"woman's plank,\" she\r\n     having gone before the committee on resolutions and made an\r\n     earnest appeal for woman's recognition by the Republican party.\r\n     The _State Record_ said:\r\n\r\n          When the Republicans, in national convention, recognized\r\n          woman, and gave her a plank in the platform of the party, it\r\n          reflected back a spirit of justice and progress which is\r\n          looked for in vain in the party opposing, of whatever name.\r\n          But when the Republicans of Iowa gave to a woman the\r\n          privilege of bringing in a plank of her own production, and\r\n          that plank was added to the State platform without a\r\n          dissenting voice, it placed Iowa, men and women alike, in\r\n          the vanguard of the world's onward march to a more rational\r\n          life, more even justice, and purer government.\r\n\r\n          In the Republican State platform of Iowa is the first real\r\n          and purely woman's plank that ever entered into any\r\n          political platform--because it originated in the brain of\r\n          woman. It was by a woman carried to the committee, and in\r\n          response to an able, dignified, and true womanly appeal, it\r\n          was accepted, and by the convention incorporated into the\r\n          platform of the party. It may seem to be a small plank, but\r\n          it has strength and durability. It is the live oak of a\r\n          living principle, that will remain sound while other planks\r\n          of greater bulk around it will have served their purpose and\r\n          wasted away.\r\n\r\n          It argues thus: if woman is competent to present a political\r\n          issue, clothed in her own language, with a dignity and\r\n          modesty that silence opposition, is she not competent to\r\n          exercise with prudence and intelligence the elective\r\n          franchise? and would she not, if entrusted with it, exercise\r\n          it for the elevation of a common humanity? The _Record_\r\n          tenders hearty congratulations not only to Mrs. Harbert, who\r\n          we know will bear the honors modestly, but also to those who\r\n          by their presence in the convention gave encouragement to\r\n          greater respect for woman's wishes, and by whose work is\r\n          demonstrated woman's fitness to be in truth a helpmeet for\r\n          man. We had a mother, and have sisters, wife, and daughter,\r\n          and that is why we would have woman enjoy every privilege\r\n          and opportunity to be useful to herself and her country that\r\n          we claim for ourself.\r\n\r\n     At the annual meeting of 1875, held at Oskaloosa, the following\r\n     letter from the governor of the State was received:\r\n\r\n                         EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, Des Moines, Iowa.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. R. G. ORWIG, _Cor. Sec. I. W. S. S.--Dear Madam_: I\r\n          have your letter inviting me to be present at your annual\r\n          meeting. Thanking you and the association for the\r\n          consideration implied, I have to express my regrets that\r\n          business of an official character will prevent me from\r\n          coming. I hope your proceedings may be characterized by such\r\n          wisdom, moderation, and sincerity as to advance the cause to\r\n          which your efforts are given. I have never been able to\r\n          discover any argument to sustain my own right to vote that\r\n          does not equally apply to woman. Whether my right is founded\r\n          upon the interest I have, in common with my fellows, in the\r\n          preservation of the free institutions of my country; or upon\r\n          the protection of my personal interests as a citizen; or\r\n          upon my right to a voice in the creation of laws to which I\r\n          am held amenable; or upon my right to influence by a vote\r\n          the direction given to revenues which I am taxed to help\r\n          supply; or upon any other right, personal, political or\r\n          moral, I have never been able to see why the reasons which\r\n          make the vote valuable to me do not apply with equal force\r\n          to woman. You doubtless think your efforts are comparatively\r\n          fruitless; but I need not tell you that while your agitation\r\n          has failed, so far, to bring you the ballot, it has\r\n          ameliorated the condition of woman in very many particulars.\r\n          Her property rights are better protected; her sphere of\r\n          activity has been enlarged, and her influence for good is\r\n          more widely recognized. So I wish you well. Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                             C. C. CARPENTER.\r\n\r\n     This year women were members of a lay delegation in the Methodist\r\n     conference, and also lay delegates to the Presbyterian synod. And\r\n     in two or three instances women have been invited to address\r\n     these bodies, and have received a vote of thanks. Many of the\r\n     orthodox clergy are openly advocating our cause, and in some\r\n     instances women have been invited by them to occupy their desks\r\n     on Sunday to preach the Gospel to the people. This is a wonderful\r\n     advance in sentiment since 1852, when in New York the clergy\r\n     would not permit women to speak, even on temperance in a public\r\n     hall.\r\n\r\n     In 1876 the society secured the services of Matilda Hindman, of\r\n     Pittsburg, Pa., who traveled over the greater part of the State,\r\n     lecturing and organizing societies, and was everywhere spoken of\r\n     as an eloquent and logical speaker. She was followed by Margaret\r\n     W. Campbell, and those who know her feel that the State gained in\r\n     her a valuable friend in everything pertaining to the interests\r\n     of woman. What is said of Miss Hindman as a speaker may also be\r\n     said of Mrs. Campbell.\r\n\r\n     The first governor of Iowa to officially recognize woman's right\r\n     to the ballot was the Hon. C. C. Carpenter, who in his message to\r\n     the General Assembly of 1876, said:\r\n\r\n          The proposed amendment to the constitution, adopted by your\r\n          predecessors, and which requires your sanction before being\r\n          submitted to the voters of the State, will come before you.\r\n          I venture to suggest, that the uniform expression in Wyoming\r\n          Territory, where woman suffrage is a fact, is favorable to\r\n          its continuance, and that wherever in Europe and America\r\n          women have voted for school or minor officers the influence\r\n          of their suffrage has been beneficent; and in view of the\r\n          peculiar appropriateness of submitting this question in this\r\n          year, 1876, when all America is celebrating achievements\r\n          which were inspired by the doctrine that taxation and\r\n          representation are of right inseparable, it is recommended\r\n          that you give the people of Iowa an opportunity to express\r\n          their judgment upon the proposed amendment at the\r\n          ballot-box.\r\n\r\n     At the request of the State Association, Miss Matilda Hindman was\r\n     granted a hearing before the legislature, and most respectful\r\n     attention was accorded to her able address. Miss Anthony was also\r\n     invited, and, at the suggestion of Mrs. Savery, she engaged the\r\n     opera-house. The seats reserved for the members were all filled,\r\n     and every part of the house occupied. The day following, the vote\r\n     in the House was taken, and carried by 54 to 40. After a careful\r\n     canvass of the Senate, it was found that there were ten votes to\r\n     spare; but alas! when the day for final action came the amendment\r\n     was lost by one vote.[410]\r\n\r\n     In 1880 Senator Gaylord of Floyd county made a speech, giving\r\n     twenty-one reasons why he voted against the submission of the\r\n     proposition for the enfranchisement of women, which was published\r\n     in full in the Des Moines _Register_, and thus sent broadcast\r\n     over the State. Mrs. Bloomer replied to Mr. Floyd through the\r\n     same paper, meeting and refuting every objection, thus in a\r\n     measure antidoting the poisonous influence of the senator's\r\n     pronunciamento.\r\n\r\n     In the spring of this year Dr. Harriette Bottsford and Mrs. Jane\r\n     C. McKinney were appointed by a caucus of Republican women, to\r\n     the Powesheik county convention, to choose delegates to the State\r\n     convention. They presented their credentials to the committee,\r\n     and the chairman reported them as delegates. On motion, they were\r\n     accepted--but some men soon bethought them that this was\r\n     establishing a bad precedent, and began maneuvering to get rid of\r\n     them. This was finally done by declaring the delegation full\r\n     without them--two men having been quietly appointed to fill\r\n     vacancies after the ladies had presented their credentials. Mrs.\r\n     McKinney made a spicy speech, saying they did not expect to be\r\n     received as delegates, but wished to remind the men that women\r\n     were citizens, tax-payers and Republicans, but unrepresented.\r\n\r\n     At the Greenback State convention of 1881, Mrs. Mary E. Nash was\r\n     nominated as the candidate of that party for State superintendent\r\n     of schools. Mrs. Nash declined the honor intended, and said that\r\n     her political flag, if it were to float at all, would be found in\r\n     another camp. She would not desert her colors for office. In 1884\r\n     Mrs. H. J. Bellangee and Mrs. A. M. Swain were regularly\r\n     accredited delegates to the National Greenback convention, held\r\n     at Indianapolis, Ind., to nominate a candidate for the\r\n     presidency, where they were received with the greatest courtesy.\r\n\r\n     The annual meeting of 1882, at Des Moines, was remarkable for the\r\n     number of clergymen, representing nearly all the different\r\n     denominations, who took part in its proceedings, each of the nine\r\n     seeming to vie with the others in expressing his belief that the\r\n     ballot for woman, as for man, was a right, not a privilege.\r\n     Bishop Hurst of the M. E. Church, made an able speech. The\r\n     executive committee sent a memorial to the Republican convention,\r\n     held in June for the nomination of State officers, asking a plank\r\n     in their platform favoring the submission of the woman suffrage\r\n     amendment. The request was not granted. Leading politicians who\r\n     professed to believe in equality of rights for women feared that\r\n     to do so would make too heavy a weight for the party to carry, it\r\n     having already incorporated a prohibition plank in its platform.\r\n     The committee also interviewed 500 editors, asking them to open\r\n     the columns of their papers to the advocacy of woman suffrage.\r\n     One hundred and twenty replied favorably, while many were\r\n     courteous and others brusque in their refusals.\r\n\r\n     A committee on legislation (Mrs. Narcissa T. Bemis, chairman) did\r\n     good work during this session of the legislature, and also\r\n     published a tract composed of contributions from twelve leading\r\n     ministers of the State, called \"The Clergymen's Tract.\" This was\r\n     sent broadcast. Nine hundred of the clergy were favored with a\r\n     copy. The Ministerial Association, held in Des Moines, passed the\r\n     following:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That we are heartily in favor of woman suffrage\r\n          as advocated by your association, and regard the same as a\r\n          proper subject for pulpit-teaching, and, as opportunity\r\n          offers of furthering said cause in our pulpit ministry, we\r\n          will avail ourselves of the same.\r\n\r\n     During this year the State Society contributed liberally to the\r\n     Nebraska campaign. Mrs. Nancy R. Allen and Mrs. Mary B. Lee each\r\n     left a small legacy to the association.\r\n\r\n     Of the annual meeting of 1883,[411] held at Ottumwa, the local\r\n     papers gave full and fair reports; while 200 papers of the State\r\n     published a condensed statement prepared by the secretary. Miss\r\n     Hindman and Mrs. Campbell were again invited to the State. No\r\n     grander work than theirs was ever done in Iowa. There is scarcely\r\n     a county which they have not canvassed; holding meetings, forming\r\n     associations, circulating petitions, distributing tracts,\r\n     preaching on Sundays in the churches, traveling, often for months\r\n     at a time, without a pledge of pecuniary aid, depending for their\r\n     expenses wholly on funds contributed at their meetings.\r\n\r\n     The State convention of 1884 met at the Christian Church at Des\r\n     Moines; Mrs. Nacissa T. Bemis presided. Mrs. Helen M. Gougar of\r\n     Indiana was one of the speakers. A committee, of which Mrs.\r\n     Martha C. Callanan was chairman, interviewed the governor, asking\r\n     a recognition of woman's right of suffrage, and were told it\r\n     should receive consideration. Accordingly, in his message to the\r\n     legislature, Governor Sherman said:\r\n\r\n          Your attention is respectfully directed to the question of\r\n          impartial suffrage, in respect to which the nineteenth\r\n          General Assembly proposed an amendment to the constitution.\r\n          Should this meet your approval, as preliminary to taking the\r\n          judgment of the voters, I recommend that it be submitted at\r\n          a special election, in order that it may be freed from the\r\n          influence of partisan politics, and thus receive an\r\n          unprejudiced vote of our citizens. Not caring to here\r\n          express an opinion upon the question itself, it is\r\n          sufficient to say that now, as heretofore, I am in favor of\r\n          the submission of any question which is of importance and\r\n          general interest.\r\n\r\n     Governor Sherman also gave it as his opinion that a good woman\r\n     should be placed on the board of trustees of every public\r\n     institution. This was the second time that an Iowa governor had\r\n     referred to this great political question in his message to the\r\n     General Assembly, Governor Carpenter having heartily indorsed the\r\n     measure in 1876. It is said, however, that Governor Newbold had\r\n     written a clause on the subject in his message in 1878, but that\r\n     it was suppressed by the careful counsel of some guardian angel\r\n     of his party.\r\n\r\n     Previous to the assembling of this legislature, petitions had\r\n     been widely circulated,[412] praying for the submission of the\r\n     amendment. Over 6,000 signatures were obtained. Each petition was\r\n     placed in the hands of a senator or member from the county in\r\n     which the names were gathered, for presentation in the respective\r\n     Houses.\r\n\r\n     For fifteen consecutive years the State Society has met annually,\r\n     made reports, passed resolutions, elected officers, listened to\r\n     speeches and transacted what other business has come before it.\r\n     Though its anniversaries have usually been held at Des Moines,\r\n     its influence through the press has pervaded the whole State.\r\n     Since 1875, the annual meetings have been held in different\r\n     cities[413] outside the capital, thus giving the people of all\r\n     sections of the State an opportunity to participate in the\r\n     deliberations. Petitions to the legislature and to congress have\r\n     been circulated by the society, delegates sent to the conventions\r\n     of the National and American Suffrage Associations,[414] and\r\n     letters addressed to the delegates of the State and National\r\n     nominating conventions of the political parties, asking for a\r\n     recognition of woman's right to the ballot in their platforms.\r\n\r\n     A brief recital of the proceedings of the Iowa legislature will\r\n     show that a large majority of the Representatives have been in\r\n     favor of submitting the question of woman suffrage to a direct\r\n     vote of the men of the State. The proposition was first presented\r\n     in the House by Hon. John P. Irish, in 1870. The resolution\r\n     passed both Houses with very little debate, was approved by the\r\n     governor, and submitted to the next General Assembly. In the\r\n     session of 1872 it was discussed in both Houses at considerable\r\n     length, and again passed in the Lower House by the strong vote of\r\n     58 ayes to 39 nays; while in the Senate it was lost by only two\r\n     majority. The House has never failed at any session since that\r\n     time, until 1884, to give a majority in its favor; but the Senate\r\n     has not made for itself so good a record. In 1872 the vote in the\r\n     Senate stood: ayes, 22; nays, 24. In 1876 it was lost by one\r\n     vote; and in 1880 lost on engrossment. In 1884 the tables were\r\n     turned; when the amendment came up in the twentieth General\r\n     Assembly for ratification, the Senate passed the bill, while the\r\n     House, for the first time, defeated it by a small majority.\r\n\r\n     By the constitution of Iowa an amendment must be approved by two\r\n     consecutive legislatures, convened in regular session. When so\r\n     approved it is then submitted to the popular vote of the\r\n     electors. As in this State the legislature meets but once in two\r\n     years, the reader can see how easily a bill passed at one session\r\n     may, two years later, be defeated by the election of new members\r\n     who are opposed to it. And thus through all these years those who\r\n     claim the ballot for woman in this State have been elated or\r\n     depressed by the action of each succeeding legislature.\r\n\r\n     The thirteenth General Assembly not only earned a good name for\r\n     enlightened statesmanship by passing the constitutional amendment\r\n     in favor of woman suffrage, but it also, by chapter 21, approved\r\n     March 8, 1870, passed an act admitting women to the practice of\r\n     law. It was under this that Judith Ellen Foster--so widely known\r\n     as an eloquent lecturer and able lawyer--Annie C. Savery, Mrs.\r\n     Emma Haddock, Louisa H. Albert, Jessie M. Johnson, and several\r\n     others have passed the necessary examination and been admitted to\r\n     practice as attorneys and counselors in all the courts of the\r\n     State. Mrs. Arabella Mansfield was admitted to the bar in 1869,\r\n     just a year previous to the enactment of the law.\r\n\r\n     Miss Linda M. Ramsey, now Mrs. Hartzell, was employed as a clerk\r\n     by Adjutant-General Baker in 1864, and held the office for some\r\n     time after the war closed. The _Record_ says she was the first\r\n     woman regularly employed and paid by the State for clerical\r\n     services. Miss Augusta Matthews served as military secretary for\r\n     Governor Stone during the war under pay of the State.\r\n\r\n     It was the thirteenth General Assembly, 1870, that first elected\r\n     a woman, Miss Mary E. Spencer, to the office of engrossing clerk;\r\n     and upon her it devolved to convey the message from the House to\r\n     the Senate, announcing the passage of the woman suffrage\r\n     amendment. In 1872 each House elected one woman among its\r\n     officers; and each succeeding General Assembly since that time\r\n     has elected from three to six women. The office of postmaster has\r\n     been filled by women for the last ten years, and is now held by\r\n     the venerable widow of General N. A. Baker, for many years the\r\n     popular adjutant-general of the State. The office of State\r\n     librarian was filled by Mrs. Ada North for seven years, and is\r\n     now held by Mrs. S. B. Maxwell. Mrs. North is (1885) librarian of\r\n     the State University at Iowa City.\r\n\r\n     The State insane hospitals are inspected by a visiting\r\n     commission, one of whom is a woman. Several of the city hospitals\r\n     are managed by women of the Catholic orders. The reform schools\r\n     have a woman on their board of trustees, of whom Governor Sherman\r\n     was graciously pleased to say that \"she discovered more of the\r\n     true inwardness of the institution in three days than her\r\n     honorable colleague had done in three years.\"\r\n\r\n     In 1876 Governor Kirkwood appointed Mrs. Nancy R. Allen notary\r\n     public. He also appointed Mrs. Merrill as teacher and chaplain at\r\n     the State penitentiary, Miss McCowen as physician of the State\r\n     insane asylum, and Dr. Sara A. Pangborn, one of the staff of\r\n     physicians of the insane hospital at Independence.\r\n\r\n     In 1874 Governor Carpenter appointed Mrs. Deborah Cattell a\r\n     commissioner to investigate the alleged cruelty in the State\r\n     Reform School at Eldora; and for this service she was paid the\r\n     same as men who served on the same commission. Governor Gear\r\n     appointed Dr. Abbie M. Cleaves delegate from Iowa to the National\r\n     Conference of Charities and Correction, and to the National\r\n     Association for the Protection of the Insane and the Prevention\r\n     of Insanity, which was held in Cleveland, Ohio, July, 1880. Mrs.\r\n     Mary Wright and Dr. Abbie Cleaves were commissioned to the\r\n     conference of the same associations at Louisville, Ky., in 1883.\r\n     The legislature of 1880 appointed Jane C. McKinney one of the\r\n     trustees of the Hospital for the Insane, at Independence.\r\n\r\n     The eighteenth General Assembly, 1880, passed an act to extend to\r\n     women the right to hold the office of county recorder. A bill\r\n     giving them the right to hold the office of county auditor passed\r\n     the House, but was lost in the Senate. Under the above law Miss\r\n     Addie Hayden was elected recorder of Warren county by a majority\r\n     of 397 votes. She ran on an independent ticket. Mrs. C. J. Hill\r\n     was chosen recorder of Osceola county at the same election.\r\n\r\n     The instruction of the youth of Iowa has fallen largely into the\r\n     hands of women. During the year 1879 the number of women employed\r\n     as teachers was 13,579, while the number of men was 7,573. In the\r\n     larger towns and cities women are almost exclusively engaged as\r\n     teachers. Miss Phebe Ludlow, after having for several years\r\n     acceptably discharged the duties of city superintendent of\r\n     schools at Davenport, was elected professor of English language\r\n     and literature in the State University at Iowa City. The chair is\r\n     still occupied by a woman, as is that of instructor of\r\n     mathematics and several other branches in that institution,\r\n     which, to the honor of Iowa be it said, always opened its doors\r\n     to both sexes alike.\r\n\r\n     The question of the eligibility of women to the office of county\r\n     superintendent of public schools having arisen by the election of\r\n     Miss Julia C. Addington in the autumn of 1869, the matter was\r\n     referred to the attorney-general by the State superintendent of\r\n     public instruction, and the following was his reply:\r\n\r\n          _Hon. A. S. Kissell, Superintendent of Public Instruction:_\r\n\r\n          DEAR SIR: Rights and privileges of persons (citizens) are\r\n          frequently extended but never abridged by implication. The\r\n          soundness and wisdom of this rule of construction is, I\r\n          believe, universally conceded. Two clauses of the\r\n          constitution, only, contain express provisions excluding\r\n          women from the rights and privileges in said provisions.\r\n          Section 1, of Article I., as to the right of suffrage, and\r\n          Section 4, of Article III., which provides that members of\r\n          the legislature must be free white male citizens. \"Free\" and\r\n          \"white\" have lost their meaning (if the words in that use\r\n          ever had any suitable or good meaning), but the word \"male\"\r\n          still retains its full force and effect. If this express\r\n          restriction exists in the constitution as to any other\r\n          office, it has escaped my notice. It is true that the words\r\n          \"person\" and \"citizen\" frequently occur in other parts of\r\n          the constitution in connection with eligibility and\r\n          qualification for office, and I fully admit that by\r\n          usage--\"time-honored usage,\" if you will--these phrases have\r\n          in common acceptation been taken to mean man in the\r\n          masculine gender only, and to exclude woman. But a recent\r\n          decision in the Court Exchequer, England, holding that the\r\n          generic term \"man\" includes woman also, indicates our\r\n          progress from a crude barbarism to a better civilization.\r\n\r\n          The office of county superintendent was created by chapter\r\n          52 of the acts of the seventh General Assembly, laws of\r\n          1868, pages 52-72. Neither in that act, nor in any\r\n          subsequent legislation on the subject, have I been able to\r\n          find any express provisions making male citizenship a test\r\n          of eligibility for the place, or excluding women; and when I\r\n          look over the duties to be performed by that officer--as I\r\n          have with some care, and, I trust, not without interest--I\r\n          deem it exceedingly fortunate for the cause of education in\r\n          Iowa that there is no provision in the law preventing women\r\n          from holding the office of county superintendent of common\r\n          schools. I know that the pronoun \"he\" is frequently used in\r\n          different sections of the act, and referring to the officer;\r\n          but, as stated above, this privilege of the citizen cannot\r\n          be taken away or denied by intendment or implication; and\r\n          women are citizens as well and as much as men.\r\n\r\n          I need scarcely add that, in my opinion, Miss Addington is\r\n          eligible to the office to which she has been elected; that\r\n          she will be entitled to her pay when she qualifies and\r\n          discharges the duties of the office, and that her decisions\r\n          on appeal, as well as all her official acts, will be legal\r\n          and binding. It is perhaps proper to state that an opinion\r\n          on this question, substantially in agreement with the\r\n          present one, was sent from this office to a gentleman\r\n          writing from Osage, in Mitchell county, several weeks ago,\r\n          which for some reason unknown to me, seems not to have been\r\n          made public in the county. I have the honor to be, etc.,\r\n\r\n                                   HENRY O'CONNOR, _Attorney-General_.\r\n\r\n     Miss Addington, in her short letter of inquiry to the\r\n     superintendent, has the following modest conclusion: \"The\r\n     position is not one I should have chosen for myself, but since my\r\n     friends have shown so much confidence in me, and many of them are\r\n     desirous that I should accept the office, I feel inclined to\r\n     gratify them, if it be found there is nothing incompatible in my\r\n     doing so.\"\r\n\r\n     The question of the eligibility of women to hold school offices\r\n     was again raised at the October election of 1875. Miss Elizabeth\r\n     S. Cooke was elected to the office of superintendent of common\r\n     schools in Warren county. The question of her right to hold the\r\n     office was carried by her opponent, Mr. Huff, to the District\r\n     Court of that county, by appeal; and that court decided that the\r\n     defendant, Miss Cooke, \"being a woman, was ineligible to the\r\n     office.\" It was then carried to the Supreme Court of the State,\r\n     which held that \"there is no constitutional inhibition upon the\r\n     rights of women to hold the office of county superintendent.\" In\r\n     the meantime, however, and immediately following the decision of\r\n     the Warren county judge, the General Assembly, March 2, 1876,\r\n     promptly came to the rescue and passed the following act, almost\r\n     unanimously:\r\n\r\n          SECTION 1. No person shall be deemed ineligible, by reason\r\n          of sex, to any school office in the State of Iowa.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 2. No person who may have been, or shall be, elected or\r\n          appointed to the office of county superintendent of common\r\n          schools, or director, in the State of Iowa, shall be\r\n          deprived of office by reason of sex.\r\n\r\n     Under the provisions of this law, and the above-cited decision of\r\n     the Supreme Court, Miss Cooke was allowed to serve out her term\r\n     of office without hindrance. Since that time women have been\r\n     elected, and discharged the duties of county superintendent with\r\n     great credit to themselves and advantage to the public. Women\r\n     have also been elected to other school offices in different parts\r\n     of the State. Mrs. Mary A. Work was unanimously elected\r\n     sub-director in district No. 6, Delaware township, Polk county,\r\n     in the spring of 1880; and soon after was made president of the\r\n     board--the first woman, so far as known, to fill the position of\r\n     president of a school board.\r\n\r\n     In 1877, in Frederica, Bremer county, Mrs. Mary Fisher attended\r\n     the school meeting, and was elected as one of the three\r\n     directors. The two others were men, one of whom immediately\r\n     resigned, saying he would not hold office with a woman. His\r\n     resignation was at once accepted. He further remarked that\r\n     \"woman's place was _to hum_; she was out of her _spear_ to school\r\n     _meetin's_, _holdin'_ office,\" etc. Mrs. Fisher had been a\r\n     teacher for six years. Mrs. Shirley, another successful teacher,\r\n     accompanied Mrs. Fisher to the next school meeting, and both\r\n     ladies voted on all questions that came up for action, and\r\n     nothing was said against their doing so.\r\n\r\n     This year (1885) the school board of Des Moines elected Mrs. Lou.\r\n     M. Wilson to the office of city superintendent of public schools,\r\n     with a salary of $1,800 a year. She has in charge eighty\r\n     teachers, among whom are two men in the position of principals.\r\n     At the woman's congress, held at Des Moines in October, 1885, Dr.\r\n     Jennie McCowen, in her report for this State, said:\r\n\r\n          An increasing number of women have been elected on\r\n          school-boards, and are serving as officers and county\r\n          superintendents of schools. Last year six women served as\r\n          presidents, thirty-five as secretaries, and fifty as\r\n          treasurers of school-boards. Of the superintendents and\r\n          principals of graded schools about one in five is a woman;\r\n          of county superintendents, one in nine; of teachers in\r\n          normal institutes, one in three; of principals of secondary\r\n          institutions of learning, one in three; of tutors and\r\n          instructors in colleges, one in two; and in the twenty-three\r\n          higher institutions of learning, thirteen young women are\r\n          officiating as professors, and in three of these colleges\r\n          the secretary of the faculty is a woman. The State board of\r\n          examiners has one woman--Miss Ella A. Hamilton of Des\r\n          Moines--and the State superintendent of public instruction\r\n          has for a number of years availed himself of the valued\r\n          services of a woman for private secretary. The _Northwestern\r\n          Educational Journal_ is edited by a woman. At the last\r\n          meeting of the State Teachers' Association a committee was\r\n          appointed to prepare a regular course of reading for\r\n          teachers. This course is mainly professional and literary,\r\n          with a leaning toward the latter. A large number of these\r\n          reading circles have already been organized, and much\r\n          interest, and even enthusiasm, is being manifested by\r\n          teachers in all parts of the State. The school of Domestic\r\n          Economy, in connection with the Agricultural College, is in\r\n          charge of a woman as dean, and, although but a year old, has\r\n          made an auspicious beginning. A number of young ladies,\r\n          graduates of the State University and other literary\r\n          schools, have gone to the School of Domestic Economy to\r\n          finish their education.\r\n\r\n     Iowa has many women engaged as journalists. Prominent among these\r\n     is Miss Maggie VanPelt, city editor of the Dubuque _Times_. She\r\n     conducts her department very ably, and acceptably to her readers.\r\n     Whether an advocate for suffrage or not, she is certainly a\r\n     practical woman's rights woman. Independent and fearless, she\r\n     goes about day and night where she pleases, and wherever her\r\n     business calls her. A revolver, which she is known to carry,\r\n     makes it safe for her to walk the street at all hours. Mrs. Will\r\n     Hollingsworth, of the Sigourney _Review_, does a large part of\r\n     the writing for that paper, and assists in the management of the\r\n     establishment. _Woman's Hour_, edited by Mary J. Coggeshall, was\r\n     published by women at Des Moines two seasons, during the\r\n     exposition. Ten thousand copies were printed for free\r\n     distribution, and a handsomely decorated department granted the\r\n     society in the exposition for their work. Mrs. E. H. Hunter and\r\n     Mrs. Woods represented the society. Mrs. Pauline Swaim is noted\r\n     for her journalistic ability. Besides working on her husband's\r\n     paper, the Oskaloosa _Herald_, she has done much for the _State\r\n     Register_, reporting for it the proceedings of the Senate. In\r\n     October, 1875, Nettie Sanford started a paper at Marshalltown,\r\n     called _The Woman's Bureau_, which she published for two years.\r\n     During 1878 she published the _San Gabriel Valley News_, in\r\n     California. Mrs. L. M. Latham for many years conducted a suffrage\r\n     column in the Cedar Rapids _Times_; since 1884 she has been\r\n     associated with Mrs. J. L. Wilson on the _Transcript_, an eight\r\n     column paper devoted to general news, temperance and woman\r\n     suffrage. The paper is owned by Mrs. Wilson. Mrs. Nettie P. Fox\r\n     edits the _Spiritual Offering_ at Ottumwa; Mrs. Hattie Campbell,\r\n     a suffrage department in _The Advance_, at Des Moines; Mary\r\n     Osborne edits the _Osceola Sentinel_, and is superintendent of\r\n     the public schools of Clark county; Mrs. Lafayette Young is\r\n     engaged on the _Atlantic Telegraph_. Very many papers in the\r\n     State have women in charge of one or more columns.\r\n\r\n     In the humbler walks of literature Iowa can boast quite a number\r\n     of women who have made successful attempts at authorship.[415] In\r\n     sculpture Mrs. Harriet A. Ketcham, of Mt. Pleasant, deserves\r\n     mention. She has the exclusive contract to model the prominent\r\n     men of Iowa for the new capitol. Mrs. Estelle E. Vore, Mrs. Cora\r\n     R. Fracker, and Miss Emma G. Holt, are known as musical\r\n     composers.\r\n\r\n     Among the lecturers of Iowa, Mrs. Matilda Fletcher is worthy of\r\n     mention. Though she has never made woman suffrage a specialty,\r\n     she is sound on that question, and frequently introduces it\r\n     incidentally in her lectures. In 1869 she was living in obscurity\r\n     in Council Bluffs, her husband being employed as a teacher in one\r\n     of the suburban schools. Young, girlish-looking, no one seeing\r\n     her would have dreamed of her possessing the capabilities she has\r\n     since displayed. She started out under many discouragements, but\r\n     has shown a perseverance, a self-reliance, and an indomitable\r\n     will that few women manifest in the same direction. Mrs. Fletcher\r\n     has been employed by the Republican party during some of the most\r\n     important and exciting campaigns, speaking throughout the State,\r\n     in halls, tents, and in the open air. Every such effort on the\r\n     part of woman is an advantage to the cause we advocate, bringing\r\n     it nearer to final success. But it is to Mrs. Stanton, Miss\r\n     Anthony, Anna Dickinson, Mrs. Livermore, and other lyceum\r\n     lecturers[416] that our State is especially indebted for a\r\n     knowledge of the true principles upon which woman founds her\r\n     claim to equal civil and political rights with man. In all\r\n     sections of our land their voices have been heard by interested\r\n     and delighted audiences.\r\n\r\n     There are about one hundred and fifty women in the medical\r\n     profession in the different cities of the State. Mrs. Yeomans, of\r\n     Clinton, is a successful practitioner. Mrs. King, allopathist,\r\n     and Mrs. Hortz, homeopathist, are regular graduates in good\r\n     practice at Des Moines. Dr. Harding, electrician, and Dr. Hilton,\r\n     allopathist, also graduates, have all the practice they can\r\n     attend to in Council Bluffs. In 1883, Dr. Jennie McCowen was\r\n     elected president of the Scott County Medical Society. This was\r\n     the first time a woman was ever elected to that office in this\r\n     State, if not in the United States.\r\n\r\n     It is quite sure that Iowa may justly claim the first woman in\r\n     the profession of dentistry--Mrs. Lucy B. Hobbs, as early as\r\n     1863.[417] At Cresco there is the firm of Dr. L. F. & Mrs. M. E.\r\n     Abbott, dental surgeons. At Mt. Pleasant, Mrs. M. E. Hildreth is\r\n     a licensed dentist in successful practice.\r\n\r\n     Rev. Augusta Chapin was, I think, the first woman to enter the\r\n     sacred office in this State. Miss Safford, Algona; Mrs. Gillette,\r\n     Knoxville; Mrs. M. A. Folsom, Marshalltown; Florence E. Kollock,\r\n     Waverly; Mrs. M. J. Janes, Spencer; Mrs. Hartsough, Ft. Dodge,\r\n     are regularly ordained preachers of the Universalist and\r\n     Unitarian faiths. There are several licensed preachers of the M.\r\n     E. Church, but none have received regular ordination.\r\n\r\n     Iowa furnished the following women who went to the front as\r\n     nurses during the war: Mrs. Harlan, wife of Senator Harlan; Mrs.\r\n     Almira Fales, Mrs. Anne Wittenmeyer, Miss Phebe Allen, Mrs.\r\n     Jerusha R. Small, Miss Melcena Elliott, Mrs. Arabella Tannehill.\r\n     These all did good service in hospital and on the field, and some\r\n     of them laid down their lives as a sacrifice. We copy the\r\n     following as one of the many facts of the war:\r\n\r\n          Some years ago Adjutant-General Baker of Des Moines received\r\n          a letter of inquiry asking about a certain soldier in the\r\n          Twenty-fourth Iowa infantry. The tone of the letter was so\r\n          peculiar as to attract considerable attention and create\r\n          much comment in the office. In reply the general stated that\r\n          the records of the regiment and the record of the soldier\r\n          (whom, for the sake of convenience, we will call Smith,\r\n          although that is far from the real name) were in his office.\r\n          A few days afterwards a gentleman from Northern Iowa\r\n          appeared, inquired for General Baker, and was closeted with\r\n          him long enough to divulge the following singular tale:\r\n\r\n          When the war broke out Miss Mary Smith, daughter of the\r\n          general's visitor, was residing in Ohio, working for a\r\n          farmer. Her father's family had moved to Iowa the fall\r\n          preceding the attack on Sumter, leaving Mary behind to\r\n          follow in the spring. Various causes conspired to delay her\r\n          departure for her Iowa home until autumn, and it was\r\n          September before she landed at Muscatine, from which place\r\n          she expected to travel by land to her father's house. She\r\n          was a large-sized, hearty-looking girl, eighteen years of\r\n          age. Arriving at Muscatine, some strange freak induced her\r\n          to assume man's apparel and enlist in the Twenty-fourth\r\n          infantry, then in rendezvous at that city. She did this\r\n          without exciting any suspicion, burned all her feminine\r\n          garments and papers, neglected to inform her friends of her\r\n          arrival, and became a soldier. Some comment was elicited by\r\n          her beardless face and girlish appearance, but as she did\r\n          her duty promptly and was particularly handy in cooking and\r\n          taking care of the sick, the young warrior speedily became a\r\n          general favorite alike with officers and men.\r\n\r\n          She passed through all the campaigns in which the regiment\r\n          was engaged without a scratch, except a close call from a\r\n          minie ball at Sabine's Cross Roads, which took the skin off\r\n          the back of her left hand, voted with the other members of\r\n          the regiment for president in 1864, and was finally mustered\r\n          out with her comrades at the close of the war. When she was\r\n          discharged she procured female apparel--although in doing so\r\n          she was obliged to make a confidant of one of her own\r\n          sex--and procured work in Illinois, not far from Rock\r\n          Island. Six months elapsed before the tan of five summers\r\n          wore off, and when she had again become \"white,\" and had\r\n          re-learned the almost forgotten customs of womanhood, she\r\n          presented herself at her father's house, where she was\r\n          received with open arms.\r\n\r\n          To all the questions which were asked by the various members\r\n          of the family she replied that she had been honestly\r\n          employed, and had never forsaken the right way. She had been\r\n          economical in the army, and invested several hundred dollars\r\n          in land in Northern Iowa, which rapidly appreciated in\r\n          value, and to-day she is well off. With the remainder of her\r\n          money she attended school. Last January a worthy man, who\r\n          had been in the same regiment, but in a different company,\r\n          made her an offer of marriage. Like a true woman she was\r\n          unwilling to bestow her hand when any part of her former\r\n          life was unknown, and before accepting the offer she made to\r\n          him a full revelation of her soldier-days. At first he could\r\n          not believe it, but when she proceeded to narrate events and\r\n          incidents which could be known only to active participants\r\n          in them, told of marches, camps, skirmishes, battles, and\r\n          the thousand and one things which never appear in print, but\r\n          which ever remain living pictures with \"old soldiers,\" he\r\n          was obliged to accept the strange tale as true. The story,\r\n          however, did not lessen his regard for her, and about the\r\n          first of February they were married.\r\n\r\n          The lady's father, after hearing the tale of her life, was\r\n          still incredulous, and only satisfied himself of its truth\r\n          by a visit to the adjutant-general's office and an\r\n          inspection of the records. By comparing dates furnished him\r\n          by his daughter with the original rolls there on file he\r\n          became fully convinced that it was all true.\r\n\r\n     A few of the inventions patented by women of Iowa are the\r\n     following:\r\n\r\n          Fly-screen door-attachment, by Phoebe R. Lamborne, West\r\n          Liberty; photograph-album, Viola J. Angie, Spencer;\r\n          step-ladder, Mrs. Mary J. Gartrell, Des Moines;\r\n          baking-powder can with measure combined, Mrs. Lillie\r\n          Raymond, Osceola; egg-stand, Mrs. M. E. Tisdale, Cedar\r\n          Rapids; egg-beater, and self-feeding griddle-greaser, Mrs.\r\n          Eugenia Kilborn, Cedar Rapids; tooth-pick holder, Mrs.\r\n          Ayers, Clinton; thermometer to regulate oven heat, Mrs. F.\r\n          Grace, Perry; the excelsior ironing-table, Mrs. S. L. Avery,\r\n          Marion; neck-yoke and pole-attachment, by which horses can\r\n          be instantly detached from the vehicle, Maria Dunham,\r\n          Dunlap; invalid bed, Mrs. Anna P. Forbes, Dubuque.\r\n\r\n     In the various business avocations I find the following:\r\n\r\n          Mrs. T. Nodles is the largest fancy grocer in the State,\r\n          doing a yearly business of $80,000. Mrs. C. F. Barron, Cedar\r\n          Rapids, designs and manufactures perforated embroidery\r\n          patterns. Statistics show there are nine hundred and\r\n          fifty-five Iowa women who own and direct farms; eighteen\r\n          manage farms; six own and direct stock-farms; twenty manage\r\n          dairy-farms; five own green-houses; nine manage\r\n          market-gardens; thirty-seven manage high institutions of\r\n          learning; one hundred and twenty-five are physicians; five\r\n          attorneys-at-law; ten ministers; three dentists; one hundred\r\n          and ten professional nurses, and one civil engineer.\r\n\r\n     In the summer of 1884, the Fort Dodge _Messenger_ had this\r\n     paragraph about a Des Moines family:\r\n\r\n          Miss Kate Tupper, of Des Moines, has been in town, visiting\r\n          at Mr. Bassett's for a few days. Kate comes of a family\r\n          which is remarkable for intelligent womanly effort and\r\n          success. Her mother is Mrs. Ellen S. Tupper, the Bee-queen\r\n          of Iowa, whose work on bee-culture is a recognized\r\n          authority everywhere; her eldest sister is a very eloquent\r\n          preacher at Colorado Springs; Miss Kate is studying\r\n          medicine, having taken herself through a full course at the\r\n          Agricultural College by her own work; and Miss Madge, who is\r\n          only sixteen, is a famous poultry raiser, and an officer of\r\n          the State Poultry Association, who has made money enough in\r\n          this business to defray her entire expenses through a full\r\n          collegiate course. Mrs. Tupper's family is a sufficient\r\n          answer to the question of woman's work, if there were no\r\n          other. Let any mother in Iowa show three boys who can beat\r\n          this.\r\n\r\n     In this year Mrs. Louisa B. Stevens was elected president of the\r\n     First National Bank at Marion, Linn county. The important\r\n     position women are taking in the business world is illustrated by\r\n     the presence of two delegates at the meeting of the American\r\n     Street Railway Association held in St. Louis in the autumn of\r\n     1885--Mrs. L. V. Gredenburg, proprietor and treasurer of the New\r\n     Albany Street Railway of New Albany, Ind., and Mrs. M. A. Turner,\r\n     secretary and treasurer of the Des Moines Railway, Des Moines,\r\n     Ia. One of the gentlemen expressed the belief that fully\r\n     $25,000,000 of street-railway stock in this country is owned by\r\n     women.\r\n\r\n     As to the distribution of the cardinal virtues between men and\r\n     women it is generally claimed that the former possess courage,\r\n     the latter fortitude. Although the pages of history are gilded\r\n     with innumerable instances of the remarkable courage of women of\r\n     all ages and conditions, and oftimes dimmed with the records of\r\n     cowardice in men of all classes, yet what has been said for\r\n     generations will probably be repeated, even in the face of so\r\n     remarkable a fact as the following:\r\n\r\n          On March 1, 1882, the Iowa House of Representatives, on\r\n          motion of Hon. A. J. Holmes, suspended the rules and passed\r\n          a bill introduced by that gentleman providing for the\r\n          presentation of a gold medal and the thanks of the General\r\n          Assembly of the State of Iowa to Miss Kate Shelly, to which\r\n          was added a money appropriation of two hundred dollars,\r\n          which passed both Houses and became a law.\r\n\r\n          In support of the bill, Mr. Holmes spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n          Mr. Speaker: No apology is required for the introduction of\r\n          this bill, and I shall make no explanation in regard to it,\r\n          save a brief _resume_ of the facts upon which the bill is\r\n          based. Miss Kate Shelly, with her widowed mother and little\r\n          sisters and brother, lives in a humble home on the\r\n          hill-side, in a rugged country skirting the Des Moines\r\n          River. Her father had died years ago in the service of the\r\n          great railway company whose line for some distance is\r\n          overlooked by her home, while her mother, by economy, severe\r\n          toil, and the assistance of Kate, was able to support her\r\n          little family.\r\n\r\n          On the night of July 6, 1881, about 8 o'clock, there\r\n          commenced one of the most memorable storms that ever visited\r\n          Central Iowa; nothing like it had ever been witnessed by the\r\n          oldest inhabitants. The Des Moines river rose over six feet\r\n          in one hour--little rills that were dry almost the year\r\n          round, suddenly developed into miniature rivers--massive\r\n          railway bridges and lines of track were swept away as if\r\n          they had been cobwebs. It was while looking out of her\r\n          window toward the high railroad bridge over Honey Creek,\r\n          that Kate Shelley saw the advancing head-light of a\r\n          locomotive descend into an abyss and become extinguished,\r\n          carrying with it the light of two lives. It was then she\r\n          realized in all its force that a terrible catastrophe had\r\n          occurred, and another more terrible, if not averted, would\r\n          soon follow to the east-bound express train, heavily laden\r\n          with passengers from the Pacific. She announced to her\r\n          mother, sisters and brother, that she must go to the scene\r\n          of the accident, and render assistance if possible, and also\r\n          warn the oncoming passenger train.\r\n\r\n          It was in vain they tried to dissuade her. Although she was\r\n          obliged to almost improvise a lantern in many of its parts,\r\n          it was but a few minutes before she was ready to set out.\r\n          Realizing then that her mission was one of peril, and that\r\n          she might not again look upon those dear faces, she kissed\r\n          each of them affectionately, and amid their sobs, hurried\r\n          out into the gloom, into the descending floods, toward the\r\n          rushing torrents--drenched to the skin, on she passed toward\r\n          the railroad to the well remembered foot-log, only to find\r\n          the waters rushing along high above and beyond the place\r\n          where it had been. Then she thought of the great bluff\r\n          rising to the west of her home and extending southward\r\n          toward the railroad track, and she determined to ascend it\r\n          and reach the bridge over this barrier to the waters. Need I\r\n          recount how she struggled on and up through the thick oak\r\n          undergrowth, that, being storm-laden drooped and made more\r\n          difficult her passage; how with clothing torn, and hands and\r\n          face bleeding she arrived at the end of the bridge, and\r\n          standing out upon the last tie she peered down into the\r\n          abyss of waters with her dim light, and called to know if\r\n          any one was there alive. In answer to her repeated calls\r\n          came the answer of the engineer, who had caught hold of and\r\n          made a lodgment in a tree-top, and around whom the waters\r\n          were still rapidly rising, sending floating logs, trees, and\r\n          driftwood against his frail support, and threatening\r\n          momentarily to dislodge and engulf him.\r\n\r\n          It took but a moment to be assured that he was the survivor\r\n          of four men who went down with the engine, and after a\r\n          moment's hurried consultation, she started for Moingona, a\r\n          mile distant, to secure assistance and to warn the\r\n          eastward-bound passenger train then nearly due. As she\r\n          passed along the high grade it seemed as if she must be\r\n          blown over the embankment, and still the heavens seemed to\r\n          give not rain but a deluge. As she approached the railway\r\n          bridge over the Des Moines river the light in her lantern,\r\n          her only guide and protection, went out. It was then that\r\n          the heroic soul of this child of only sixteen years became\r\n          most fully apparent; facing the storm which almost took away\r\n          her breath, and enveloped in darkness that rendered every\r\n          object in nature invisible, she felt her way to the railroad\r\n          bridge. Here she must pass for a distance of four or five\r\n          hundred feet over the rushing river beneath on the naked\r\n          ties. As the wind swept the bridge she felt how unsafe it\r\n          would be to attempt walking over it, and getting down upon\r\n          her hands and knees, clutching the timbers with an almost\r\n          despairing energy, she painfully and at length successfully\r\n          made the passage. She reached the station, and having told\r\n          of the catastrophe at the bridge, and requested the stoppage\r\n          of the passenger train then about due, she fainted and fell\r\n          upon the platform. This very briefly, wanting in much that\r\n          is meritorious in it, is the story of Kate Shelly and the\r\n          6th of July. Her parents were countrymen of Sarsfield, of\r\n          Emmett, and O'Connell--of the land that has given heroes to\r\n          every other and dishonored none. It was an act well worthy\r\n          to rank her with that other heroine, who, launching her\r\n          frail craft from the long stone pier, braved the terrible\r\n          seas on that Northumberland coast to save the lives of\r\n          others at the risk of her own.\r\n\r\n          Mr. Holmes then produced a copy of the _State Register_, and\r\n          requested the clerk to read the article therein contained,\r\n          giving the details of the heroic girl's action, written at\r\n          the time of its occurrence, and after the clerk had read the\r\n          article, concluded by saying: \"I hope, Mr. Speaker, that\r\n          this bill may pass, believing that it is right, and further\r\n          believing that the State of Iowa will do itself as much\r\n          honor as the young lady named in the bill, in thus\r\n          recognizing the greatest debt in our power to pay--that to\r\n          humanity.\" Mr. Pickler moved to amend by instructing the\r\n          gentleman from Boone (Mr. Holmes) to make the presentation.\r\n          Carried, and the bill was amended accordingly, as above. On\r\n          motion of Mr. Holmes, the rules were suspended, and the bill\r\n          passed by a vote of 90 to 1. The governor of the State, Hon.\r\n          A. J. Holmes, and Hon. J. D. Gillett were authorized to\r\n          procure a medal of design and inscription to be approved by\r\n          them, and present the same to the donee with the thanks of\r\n          the General Assembly of the State of Iowa.\r\n\r\n          The medal, which is of elegant design and workmanship, was\r\n          executed by Messrs Tiffany & Co., of New York, and was\r\n          presented to Miss Shelly during the holidays of 1883. It is\r\n          round in form, about three inches in diameter and weighs\r\n          four ounces five and a half pennyweights. On both sides it\r\n          is sunken below the circular edges and the figures and\r\n          decorations are then displayed in bold relief. On the face\r\n          is a figure emblematic of Kate Shelly's daring exploit. It\r\n          represents a young girl with a lantern in her left hand and\r\n          her right thrown far out in warning, her hair streaming in\r\n          the wind and her wet drapery clinging to her form, making\r\n          her way over the ties of a high railroad bridge, in storm\r\n          and tempest, with the lightning playing about her. In a\r\n          semi-circle over the figure are the words: \"Heroism, Youth,\r\n          Humanity.\" On the reverse is the following inscription:\r\n\r\n          \"Presented by the State of Iowa to Kate Shelly, with the\r\n          thanks of the General Assembly, in recognition of the\r\n          courage and devotion of a child of fifteen years, whom\r\n          neither the terror of the elements nor the fear of death\r\n          could appal in her efforts to save human life during the\r\n          terrible storm and flood in the Des Moines valley on the\r\n          night of July 6, 1881.\"\r\n\r\n          Surrounding the inscription is a wreath of leaves and\r\n          beneath it the great seal of Iowa.\r\n\r\n          The presentation was made at Ogden in the presence of 3,000\r\n          people. It was given in the name of the State of Iowa by Mr.\r\n          Welker Given, secretary to Governor Sherman, July 4, 1884,\r\n          who represented the governor in his necessary absence. Hon.\r\n          J. A. T. Hull, Secretary of State, introduced Miss Shelly\r\n          and recounted her heroic deed of that fearful night, after\r\n          which Mr. Given made the presentation speech. The response\r\n          on behalf of Miss Shelly was made by Professor J. D. Curran,\r\n          an old friend and teacher.\r\n\r\n     All very well, but how much better to have placed Kate Shelly\r\n     (bearing the name of one of England's great poets) in the\r\n     University at Des Moines, and given her a thorough education,\r\n     from the primary through the whole collegiate course, and the\r\n     school for law, medicine, or theology. A girl capable of such\r\n     heroism and self-sacrifice must possess capacities and powers\r\n     worthy the highest opportunities for development. Kate Shelly,\r\n     with the scientific training of a civil engineer, might shed far\r\n     more honor on her native State than sitting in ignorance and\r\n     poverty on the banks of the Des Moines river with a gold medal\r\n     round her neck.\r\n\r\n     The Patrons of Husbandry, having at one time as many as 1,998\r\n     Granges in the State, admit women to equal membership and equal\r\n     rights. They have the same privileges in debate as men, and an\r\n     equal vote in all matters concerning the Grange. The Grangers do\r\n     not seem to fear that the children will suffer, or home interests\r\n     be neglected, on account of this liberty given to women. Miss\r\n     Garretson is State agent and lecturer for this order, and has\r\n     accomplished much good by her labors among the people of the\r\n     rural districts. She claims equal rights for woman even to the\r\n     ballot. The Independent Order of Good Templars passed resolutions\r\n     unqualifiedly committing the grand lodge of the State in favor of\r\n     granting suffrage to woman, and pledging themselves to labor for\r\n     the furtherance of that object. Temperance women who have\r\n     heretofore opposed the enfranchisement of their sex, and objected\r\n     to mixing the two questions, are coming to see that a powerless,\r\n     disfranchised class can do little toward removing the great evil\r\n     that is filling the land with pauperism and crime, and sending\r\n     sixty thousand victims annually to a drunkard's grave. They have\r\n     prayed and plead with the liquor-seller; they have petitioned\r\n     electors and law-makers, but all in vain; and now they begin to\r\n     see that work must accompany prayer, and that if they would save\r\n     their sons from destruction they must strike a blow in their\r\n     defense that will be felt by the enemy. Hence the Christian\r\n     Temperance Union, which at the outset declared itself opposed to\r\n     woman suffrage, has now resolved in favor of that measure as a\r\n     necessity for the furtherance of their cause.\r\n\r\n     On March 31, 1880, Judith Ellen Foster, of Clinton, made an able\r\n     and eloquent argument before the Senate Committee on Education\r\n     and Labor, at Washington, on Senator Logan's proposition to\r\n     constitute the revenue on alcoholic liquors a national\r\n     educational fund. At a meeting of the State Union held in 1883,\r\n     resolutions were passed, declaring woman's efforts in temperance\r\n     of no avail, until with ballots in their own hands, they could\r\n     coin their ideas and sympathies into law, and that henceforward\r\n     they would labor to secure that power, that would speedily make\r\n     their prayers and tears of some avail. This action gave a new\r\n     impetus to the suffrage movement. At the State convention, Mrs.\r\n     Jane Amy M'Kinney was appointed Superintendent of Franchise.\r\n     Circulars were issued advising the Unions to make suffrage a part\r\n     of their local work, and the advice was promptly followed in many\r\n     sections of the State. At the election on the prohibitory\r\n     amendment, June 29, 1882, women rallied at the polls, and\r\n     furnished tickets to all whom they could persuade to take them,\r\n     and this helped to roll up a large vote in favor of the\r\n     amendment.\r\n\r\n     The laws of Iowa have been comparatively liberal to woman, and\r\n     with each successive codification have been somewhat improved. By\r\n     the code of 1857, the old right of dower, or life interest in\r\n     one-third of the real estate of a deceased husband, was made an\r\n     absolute interest; and this is the law at the present time. Of\r\n     the personal property, the wife takes one-third if there are\r\n     children, and one-half if there are no children to inherit. The\r\n     same rule applies to the husband of a deceased wife. The codes of\r\n     1857 and 1860 each provided that the husband could not remove the\r\n     wife, nor their children, from their homestead without the\r\n     consent of the wife; and the code of 1875, now in force, changed\r\n     this only so as to provide that neither shall the wife remove the\r\n     husband without his consent. Deeds of real estate must be signed\r\n     by both husband and wife, but no private examination of either\r\n     has ever been required in Iowa. A husband and wife may deed\r\n     property directly to each other.\r\n\r\n     By the code of 1851 the personal property of the wife did not\r\n     vest at once in the husband, but if left within his control it\r\n     became liable for his debts, unless she filed a notice with the\r\n     recorder of deeds, setting forth her claim to the property, with\r\n     an exact description. And the same rule applied to specific\r\n     articles of personal property. Married women abandoned by their\r\n     husbands could be authorized, on proper application to the\r\n     District Court, to transact business in their own name. The same\r\n     provisions were substantially reenacted in the code of 1860.\r\n     Under both codes the husband was entitled to the wages and\r\n     earnings of his wife, and could sue for them in the courts.\r\n\r\n     But the code of 1873 made a great advance in recognizing the\r\n     rights of married women; and it is said the revisers sought, as\r\n     far as possible, to place the husband and wife on an entire\r\n     equality as to property rights. By its provisions, a married\r\n     woman may own, in her own right, real and personal property\r\n     acquired by descent, gift or purchase; and she may manage, sell,\r\n     convey, and devise the same by will to the same extent, and in\r\n     the same manner, that the husband can property belonging to him.\r\n     And this provision is followed by others which fully confer on\r\n     the married woman the control of her own property. Among other\r\n     things it is enacted, that a wife may receive the wages of her\r\n     personal labor, and maintain an action therefor in her own name,\r\n     and hold the same in her own right; and she may prosecute and\r\n     defend all actions at law, or in equity, for the preservation and\r\n     protection of her rights and property. Contracts may be made by a\r\n     wife, and liabilities incurred, and the same may be enforced by,\r\n     or against her, to the same extent as though she were unmarried.\r\n     The property of both husband and wife is equally liable for the\r\n     expenses of the family and the education of their children, and\r\n     neither is liable for the debts of the other contracted before\r\n     marriage. By the code of 1873, now in force, it is declared that\r\n     the parents are the natural guardians of their children, and are\r\n     equally entitled to their care and custody; and either parent\r\n     dying before the other, the survivor becomes the guardian.\r\n\r\n     But notwithstanding the seemingly equal provisions of our code,\r\n     there is still a great disparity in the laws relating to the\r\n     joint property of husband and wife--or property accumulated\r\n     during marriage by their joint earnings and savings. Such\r\n     property, whether real or personal, is generally held in the name\r\n     of the husband--no matter how much his wife may have helped to\r\n     accumulate it. If the wife dies, the husband still holds it all,\r\n     and neither law nor lawyers can molest him, or question his right\r\n     to it. But if the husband dies, the case is very different.\r\n     Instead of being left in quiet possession of what is rightfully\r\n     her own, to use and guard with all a mother's care and\r\n     watchfulness for the benefit of her children, the law comes in\r\n     and claims the right to appoint administrators and guardians--to\r\n     require bonds and a strict accountability from her, and to set\r\n     off to her a certain share of what should be as wholly hers as it\r\n     is the husband's when the wife dies.\r\n\r\n     This is the old common law, that has come down to us from\r\n     barbarous times, and the light of the nineteenth century has not\r\n     yet been sufficient to so illumine the minds of Iowa legislators\r\n     as to enable them to render exact justice to woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[395] In 1849 her husband was, appointed post-master, she became\r\nhis deputy, was duly sworn in, and during the administration of\r\nTaylor and Fillmore served in that capacity. When she assumed her\r\nduties the improvement in the appearance and conduct of the office\r\nwas generally acknowledged. A neat little room adjoining became a\r\nkind of ladies' exchange where those coming from different parts of\r\nthe town could meet to talk over the contents of the last _Lily_\r\nand the progress of the woman suffrage movement in general. Those\r\nwho enjoyed the brief interregnum of a woman in the post-office,\r\ncan readily testify to the loss to the ladies of the village and\r\nthe void felt by all when Mrs. Bloomer and the _Lily_ left for the\r\nWest and men again reigned supreme.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Bloomer removed to Mt. Vernon, Ohio, in 1853, and the\r\npublication of the _Lily_ was continued; she was also the associate\r\neditor of the _Western Home Visitor_. Mrs. Bloomer lectured in the\r\nprincipal cities of Ohio and throughout the north-west, and was one\r\nof a committee of five appointed to memorialize the legislature of\r\nOhio for a prohibitory law, and assisted in the formation of\r\nseveral lodges of Good Templars.\r\n\r\n[396] The officers were: _President_, Mrs. D.

When the society was organized, in 1870, it declared\r\nitself independent and remained thus until 1879, when, by a small\r\nvote, it was made auxiliary to the American Association.

D., was professor\r\nfor nineteen years, six years dean of the faculty, and four years\r\nmember of the board of incorporators. After graduation Laura Ross\r\nspent two years in study abroad, and, returning, commenced practice\r\nin Milwaukee, where she has been ever since.\r\n\r\n     By an act of Congress approved May 29, 1848, Wisconsin was\r\n     admitted to the Union. Its diversity of soil and timber, the\r\n     healthfulness of its climate and the purity of its waters,\r\n     attracted people from the New England and Middle States, who\r\n     brought with them fixed notions as to moral conduct and political\r\n     action, and no little repugnance to many of the features of the\r\n     old common law. Hence in Wisconsin's territorial conventions and\r\n     legislative assemblies many of the progressive ideas of the East\r\n     were incorporated into her statutes. Failing to lift married\r\n     women into any solid position of independence, the laws yet gave\r\n     them certain protective rights concerning the redemption of lands\r\n     sold for taxes, and the right to dispose of any estate less than\r\n     a fee without the husband's consent. In case of divorce the wife\r\n     was entitled to her personal estate, dower and alimony, and with\r\n     the consent of her husband she could devise her real estate. She\r\n     was entitled to dower in any lands of which the husband was\r\n     seized during marriage. Gen. A. W. Randall was active in making\r\n     the first digest and compilation of the laws of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n     The legislature of 1850 was composed of notably intelligent men.\r\n     Nelson Dewey was governor, Moses M. Strong, a leading lawyer,\r\n     speaker of the Assembly, and the late Col. Samuel W. Beal,\r\n     lieutenant-governor. Early in the session a bill was introduced,\r\n     entitled \"An act to provide for the protection of married women\r\n     in the enjoyment of their own property,\" which provoked a stormy\r\n     debate. Some saw the dissolution of marriage ties in the\r\n     destruction of the old common-law doctrine that \"husband and wife\r\n     are one, and that one the husband\"; while arguments were made in\r\n     its favor by Hon. David Noggle, George Crasey, and others.\r\n     Conservative judges held that the right to own property did not\r\n     entitle married women to convey it; therefore in 1858 the law was\r\n     amended, giving further security to the wife to transact business\r\n     in her own name, if her husband was profligate and failed to\r\n     support her; but not until 1872 did the law protect a married\r\n     woman in her right to transact business, make contracts, possess\r\n     her separate earnings, and sue and be sued in her own name. The\r\n     legislature of 1878 reenacted all the former laws; and married\r\n     women may now hold, convey and devise real estate; make contracts\r\n     and transact business in their own names; and join with their\r\n     husbands in a deed, without being personally liable in the\r\n     covenants. In the matter of homesteads, the husband cannot convey\r\n     or encumber without the signature of the wife, and thus a liberal\r\n     provision is always secure for her and the children.\r\n\r\n     By the law of 1878, if the husband dies leaving no children and\r\n     no will, his entire estate descends to his widow.[420] If the\r\n     owner of a homestead dies intestate and without children, the\r\n     homestead descends, free of judgments and claims--except\r\n     mortgages and mechanics' liens--to his widow; if he leaves\r\n     children, the widow retains a life interest in the homestead,\r\n     continuing until her marriage or death.\r\n\r\n     Thus from the organization of the State, Wisconsin has steadily\r\n     advanced in relieving married women from the disabilities of the\r\n     old common law. The same liberal spirit which has animated her\r\n     legislators has admitted women to equality of opportunities in\r\n     the State University at Madison; elected them as county\r\n     superintendents of public schools; appointed them on the State\r\n     board of charities, and as State commissioners to a foreign\r\n     exposition;[421] and welcomed them to the professions of\r\n     medicine, law and the ministry.\r\n\r\n     By the constitution of Wisconsin the right of suffrage was\r\n     awarded to four classes of citizens, twenty-one years and over,\r\n     who have resided in the State for one year next preceding an\r\n     election.\r\n\r\n     _First_--Citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\n     _Second_--Persons of foreign birth who have declared their\r\n     intention to become citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\n     _Third_--Persons of Indian blood who have already been declared\r\n     by act of congress citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\n     _Fourth_--Civilized persons of Indian descent who are not members\r\n     of any tribe.\r\n\r\n     While thus careful to provide for all males, savage and\r\n     civilized, down to one thousand Indians outside their tribe, the\r\n     constitution in no way recognizes the women of the State,\r\n     one-half its civilized citizens. However, the question of woman\r\n     suffrage was early agitated in this State, and its advocates were\r\n     able men. In 1856 there was an able minority report published,\r\n     from C. L. Sholes, of the Committee on Expiration and Reenactment\r\n     of Laws, to whom were referred sundry petitions praying that\r\n     steps might be taken to confer upon women the right of suffrage.\r\n     In 1857, there was another favorable minority report by Judge\r\n     David Noggle, and J. T. Mills. It has been twice considered by\r\n     the legislatures of 1868-69, and 1880-81, failing each time by a\r\n     small majority. A constitutional amendment is supposed by some to\r\n     be necessary to effect this needed reform, but the legislature is\r\n     competent to pass a bill declaring women possessed of the right\r\n     to vote, without any constitutional amendment. The legislature of\r\n     New York all through the century has extended the right of\r\n     suffrage to certain classes and deprived others of its exercise,\r\n     without changing the constitution. The power of the legislature\r\n     which represents the people is anterior to the constitution, as\r\n     the people through their representatives make the constitution.\r\n\r\n     The women, both German and American, awoke to action and\r\n     organized a local suffrage society at Janesville in 1868. _The\r\n     Revolution_ said:\r\n\r\n          From the report of a recent convention held in Janesville,\r\n          we find the leading men and women of that city have formed\r\n          an Impartial Suffrage organization, and are resolved to make\r\n          all their citizens equal before the law. Able addresses were\r\n          made by the Rev. S. Farrington, Rev. Sumner Ellis, and a\r\n          stirring appeal issued to the people of the State, signed by\r\n          Hon. J. T. Dow, G. B. Hickox, Mrs. J. H. Stillman, Joseph\r\n          Baker and Mrs. F. Harris Reed. Mrs. Paulina J. Roberts of\r\n          Racine, a practical farmer in a very large sense, delivered\r\n          an address which was justly complimented.\r\n\r\n     The first popular convention held in Wisconsin, with national\r\n     speakers, convened in Milwaukee February 15, 16, 1869.[422] The\r\n     bill then pending in the legislature to submit the question of\r\n     woman suffrage to the electors of the State added interest to\r\n     this occasion. Parker Pillsbury, in _The Revolution_, said:\r\n\r\n          The Wisconsin convention seems to have been quite equal in\r\n          all respects to its predecessors at Chicago and other\r\n          places. Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony were accompanied to\r\n          Milwaukee by Mrs. Livermore, a new Western star of \"bright\r\n          particular effulgence,\" and the proceedings throughout were\r\n          characterized by argument, eloquence and interest beyond\r\n          anything of the kind ever witnessed there before. The\r\n          Milwaukee papers teem with accounts of it, most of them of\r\n          very friendly tone and spirit, even if opposed to the\r\n          objects under consideration. The _Evening Wisconsin_ said,\r\n          if any one supposed for an instant that the call for a\r\n          Woman's Suffrage convention would draw out only that class\r\n          known as strong-minded, such a one was never more deceived\r\n          in his or her life. At the opening of the convention[423]\r\n          yesterday, the City Hall was crowded with as highly\r\n          intelligent an audience of ladies and gentlemen as ever\r\n          gathered there before.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Stanton spoke at the evening session to an immense audience\r\n     on the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That a man's government is worse than a white\r\n          man's government, because in proportion as you increase the\r\n          rulers you make the condition of the ostracised more\r\n          hopeless and degraded.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That, as the cry of a \"white man's government\"\r\n          created an antagonism between the Irish and the negro,\r\n          culminating in the New York riots of '63, so the Republican\r\n          cry of \"Manhood Suffrage\" creates an antagonism between the\r\n          black man and all women, and will culminate in fearful\r\n          outrages on womanhood, especially in the Southern States.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That by the establishment of an aristocracy of\r\n          sex in the District of Columbia, by the introduction of the\r\n          word \"male\" into the Federal Constitution in Article 14,\r\n          Section 2, and by the proposition now pending to enforce\r\n          manhood suffrage in all the States of the Union, the\r\n          Republican party has been guilty of three excessively\r\n          arbitrary acts, three retrogressive steps in legislation,\r\n          alike invidious and insulting to woman, and suicidal to the\r\n          nation.\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony followed showing that every advance step in manhood\r\n     suffrage added to woman's degradation. Quite a number of ladies\r\n     and gentlemen[424] of Wisconsin spoke well of the various\r\n     sessions of the convention. Altogether it was a most enthusiastic\r\n     meeting, and the press and the pulpit did their part to keep up\r\n     the discussion for many weeks after.\r\n\r\n     These resolutions, readily passed in the Milwaukee convention,\r\n     had been rejected at all others held in the West during this\r\n     campaign, although Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony had earnestly\r\n     advocated them everywhere. They early foresaw exactly what has\r\n     come to pass, and did their uttermost to rouse women to the\r\n     danger of having their enfranchisement indefinitely postponed.\r\n     They warned them that the debate once closed on negro suffrage,\r\n     and the amendments passed, the question would not be opened again\r\n     for a generation. But their warnings were unheeded. The fair\r\n     promises of Republicans and Abolitionists that, the negro\r\n     question settled, they would devote themselves to woman's\r\n     enfranchisement, deceived and silenced the majority. How well\r\n     they have kept their promises is fully shown in the fact that\r\n     although twenty years have passed, the political status of woman\r\n     remains unchanged. The Abolitionists have drifted into other\r\n     reforms, and the Republicans devote themselves to more\r\n     conservative measures. The Milwaukee convention was adjourned to\r\n     Madison, where Mrs. Livermore, Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony\r\n     addressed the legislature, Gov. Fairchild presiding.\r\n\r\n     In 1870, March 16, 17, a large and enthusiastic convention was\r\n     held at Janesville, in Lappin's Hall. Rev. Dr. Maxon, Lilia\r\n     Peckham and Mrs. Stanton were among the speakers. After this, the\r\n     latter being on a lyceum trip, spoke in many of the chief cities\r\n     of the State and drew general attention to the question.\r\n\r\n     The following clear statement of the petty ways in which girls\r\n     can be defrauded of their rights to a thorough education by\r\n     narrow, bigoted men entrusted with a little brief authority, is\r\n     from the pen of Lilia Peckham, a young girl of great promise, who\r\n     devoted her rare talents to the suffrage movement. Her early\r\n     death was an irreparable loss to the women of Wisconsin:[425]\r\n\r\n          ED. NEWS:--We find proofs at every step that one class\r\n          cannot legislate for another, the rich for the poor, nor men\r\n          for women.\r\n\r\n          The State University, supported by the taxes of the people\r\n          and for the benefit of the people, should offer equal\r\n          advantages to men and women. By amendment of the\r\n          Constitution in 1867, it was declared that the University\r\n          shall be open to female as well as male students, under such\r\n          regulations and restrictions as the board of regents may\r\n          deem proper. At first the students recited together, but Mr.\r\n          Chadbourne made it a condition of accepting the presidency\r\n          that they should be separated. I do not speak of the\r\n          separation of the sexes to find fault. I conceive that if\r\n          equal advantages be given women by the State, whether in\r\n          connection with or apart from men, they have no ground for\r\n          complaint. My object is to compare the advantages given to\r\n          the sexes and see the practical effect of legislation by men\r\n          alone in this department. From all the facts that are now\r\n          pressed upon us, confused, contradictory and obscure, we\r\n          begin to obtain a glimpse of the general law that informs\r\n          them. The University has a college of arts (including the\r\n          department of agriculture, of engraving and military\r\n          tactics), a college of letters, preparatory department, law\r\n          department, post-graduate course, last and certainly least,\r\n          a female college. The faculty and board of instructors\r\n          number twenty-one. The college of arts has nine professors,\r\n          one of natural philosophy, one each of mental philosophy,\r\n          modern languages, rhetoric, chemistry, mathematics,\r\n          agriculture, and comparative anatomy, and a tutor. In the\r\n          department of engineering is an officer of the United States\r\n          Army. In the college of letters is the same faculty, with\r\n          the addition of William F. Allen, professor of ancient\r\n          languages and history, one coming from a family of scholarly\r\n          teachers and thoroughly fitted for his post. In the law\r\n          department are such names as L. S. Dixon and Byron Paine.\r\n\r\n          Read now the names composing the faculty of the female\r\n          college, Paul A. Chadbourne, M. D., president; T. N.\r\n          Haskell, professor of rhetoric and English literature; Miss\r\n          Elizabeth Earle, preceptress; Miss Brown, teacher of music;\r\n          Miss Eliza Brewster, teacher of drawing and painting.\r\n          Compare these faculties and note what provision is made here\r\n          for the sciences and languages. Look at the course of\r\n          instruction in the college of arts. During the first year\r\n          the men study higher algebra, conic sections, plane\r\n          trigonometry, German (Otto's) botany, Gibbon's Rome. In the\r\n          college of letters the course is similar, but more attention\r\n          is given to classical studies; to Livy, Xenophon and Horace.\r\n          During the same years in the female college, they are\r\n          studying higher arithmetic, elementary algebra, United\r\n          States history, grammar, geography and map drawing. Truly a\r\n          high standard! The studies in the first term of the\r\n          preparatory department (to which none can be admitted under\r\n          twelve years of age) are identical with those in the female\r\n          college at the same time, except the Latin. Indeed, I cannot\r\n          see why it would not be an advantage to the students of the\r\n          female college to go into the preparatory department during\r\n          their first college year, since they can get their own\r\n          course with geometry added, and if they stay three years a\r\n          proportional amount of Latin and Greek. I could compare the\r\n          whole course in the same way, but my time and the reader's\r\n          patience would fail. There is no hint either of any thorough\r\n          prescribed course in any of the languages. In the first and\r\n          fourth year no foreign language is put down. In each term of\r\n          the second year French and Latin are written as elective,\r\n          the same for Latin or German in the third. This is a\r\n          wretched course at the best. I have no faith in a course set\r\n          down so loosely as \"Latin\" instead of being defined as to\r\n          what course of Latin, and what authors are read. In that\r\n          case we know exactly how much is required and expected, and\r\n          what the standard of scholarship. In the college of letters\r\n          we know that they go from Livy to Cicero on Old Age, then to\r\n          Horace and Tacitus. Similar definiteness would be\r\n          encouraging in the female catalogue. Its absence gives us\r\n          every reason to believe that the course does not amount to\r\n          enough to add any reputation to the college by being known.\r\n          Under the head of special information we are told that in\r\n          addition to this prescribed course of \"thorough education\r\n          young ladies will be instructed in any optional study taught\r\n          in the college of letters or arts, for which they are\r\n          prepared.\" By optional I understand any of the studies\r\n          marked elective, since they are the only optional studies.\r\n          In the college of letters there is but one, and that is the\r\n          calculus. In the college of arts the optional studies are\r\n          generally, not always, those that they could not be prepared\r\n          for in the course prescribed by their own college. Under the\r\n          head of degrees we find a long account of the A. B., A. M.,\r\n          P. B., S. B., S. M., L. B., Ph. D., to which the fortunate\r\n          gentlemen are entitled after so much study. Lastly, the\r\n          students of the female college may receive \"such appropriate\r\n          degrees as the regents may determine.\" I wonder how often\r\n          that solemn body deliberates as to whether a girl shall be\r\n          A. B., P. B., or A. M., or whether they ever give them any\r\n          degree at all. It makes little difference. With such a\r\n          college course a degree means nothing, and only serves to\r\n          cheapen what may be well earned by the young men of the\r\n          college.\r\n\r\n     In 1870, the stockholders of the Milwaukee Female College elected\r\n     three women on their board of trustees: Mrs. Wm. P. Lynde, Mrs.\r\n     Wm. Delos Love and Mrs. John Nazro. This is the first time in the\r\n     history of the institution that women have been represented in\r\n     the board of trustees.\r\n\r\n     Elizabeth R. Wentworth was an earnest and excellent writer and\r\n     kept up a healthy agitation through the columns of her husband's\r\n     paper at Racine.\r\n\r\n                                        RACINE, August 4, 1875.\r\n\r\n          MY DEAR MISS ANTHONY: Would it not be well for us women to\r\n          accept the hint afforded by these Englishmen, and bind\r\n          ourselves together by a constitution and by-laws. By so\r\n          doing we might sooner be enabled to secure the rights which\r\n          men seem so persistently determined to withhold from us.\r\n          Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                   E. R. WENTWORTH.\r\n\r\n     The growing strength of woman suffrage in England has caused\r\n     considerable commotion in that country, among officials and\r\n     others. Its growth has led the men to form a club in opposition\r\n     to it, composed of such men as Mr. Bouverie, a noted member of\r\n     Parliament; Sir Henry James, late attorney-general; Mr. Childers,\r\n     late first lord of the admiralty.\r\n\r\n     The formation of this club calls out a few words from Mrs.\r\n     Stanton, who sarcastically says:\r\n\r\n          Is not this the first organized resistance in the history of\r\n          the race, against the encroachment of women; the first manly\r\n          confession by those high in authority--by lords,\r\n          attorney-generals, sirs, and gentlemen--of fear at the\r\n          progressive steps of the daughters of men? These\r\n          conservative gentlemen had no doubt found Lady Amberly,\r\n          Lydia Becker, and Mrs. Fawcett too much for them in debate;\r\n          they had probably winced under the satire of Frances Power\r\n          Cobbe, and trembled before the annually swelling lists of\r\n          suffrage petitions. Single-handed they saw they were\r\n          helpless against this incoming tide of feminine\r\n          persuasiveness, and so it seems they called a meeting of\r\n          faint-hearted men, and bound themselves together by a\r\n          constitution and by-laws to protect the franchise from the\r\n          encroachment of women.\r\n\r\n     In the legislature of 1880, the proposition to submit an\r\n     amendment for woman suffrage to a vote of the people, passed both\r\n     Houses. In 1881 it passed one branch and was lost in the other.\r\n     Senator Simpson introduced another bill in 1882[426] which was\r\n     lost. These successive defeats discouraged the women and they\r\n     instructed their friends in the legislature to make no further\r\n     attempts for a constitutional amendment, because they had not the\r\n     slightest hope of its passage.\r\n\r\n     The growing interest in the temperance question at this time\r\n     produced some divisions in the suffrage ranks. Some thought it\r\n     had been one of the greatest obstacles to the success of the\r\n     suffrage cause, rousing the opposition of a very large and\r\n     influential class. Millions of dollars are invested in this State\r\n     in breweries and distilleries, and members are elected to the\r\n     legislature to watch these interests. Knowing the terrible\r\n     sufferings of women and children through intemperance, they\r\n     naturally infer that the ballot in the hands of women would be\r\n     inimical to their interests, hence the opposition of this wealthy\r\n     and powerful class to the suffrage movement. Others thought the\r\n     agitation was an advantage, especially in bringing the women in\r\n     the temperance movement to a sense of their helplessness to\r\n     effect any reform without a voice in the laws. They thought, too,\r\n     that the power behind the liquor interests was readily outweighed\r\n     by the moral influence of the best men and women in the State,\r\n     especially as the church began to feel some responsibility in the\r\n     question. The Milwaukee _Wisconsin_ of June 4, 1883, gives this\r\n     interesting item:\r\n\r\n          The Rev. Father Mahoney, of St. John's Cathedral, preached a\r\n          temperance sermon to a large concourse of people yesterday\r\n          morning, in which he heartily indorsed the action of Mayor\r\n          Stowell in his war against the ordinary saloon, and declared\r\n          that he should be reelected. He also said that the men who\r\n          opposed him were covering themselves with infamy, and that\r\n          he could not conscientiously administer the sacraments to\r\n          any saloon-keeper who refused to obey the commands of the\r\n          Church or the laws of the State concerning the good order\r\n          and welfare of the city. The sermon caused quite a stir, and\r\n          was much discussed in secular as well as religious circles.\r\n\r\n     The State Association[427] has maintained an unswerving course,\r\n     between fanatacism and ultra-conservatism. Since 1869 it has\r\n     stood as on the watch-tower, quick to see opportunities, and ever\r\n     ready to cooeperate with the legislative bodies in the State, and\r\n     well may we be proud of our achievements when we remember that by\r\n     the census of 1870 Wisconsin is the first foreign and the second\r\n     Roman Catholic State in the Union, and that at our centennial\r\n     exposition in 1876 our public schools stood number one.\r\n\r\n     Rev. Olympia Brown Willis moved into the State of Wisconsin in\r\n     1877, and became pastor of the church of the Good Shepherd, in\r\n     Racine, and exerted a wide influence, not only as a liberal\r\n     theologian, but as an earnest advocate of suffrage for woman. As\r\n     a result of her efforts a most successful Woman's Council was\r\n     held in Racine, March 26, 1883, alternating in the church of the\r\n     Good Shepherd and Blake's Opera House. One of the chief\r\n     speakers[428] was Dr. Corwin, pastor of the First Presbyterian\r\n     Church, who was also on the managing committee. The cordiality of\r\n     many of the western clergy, in strong contrast with those in the\r\n     east, makes their favorable action worthy of comment, though the\r\n     liberality of the few is of little avail until in their\r\n     ecclesiastical assemblies, as organizations, they declare the\r\n     equality of woman not only before the law, but in all the offices\r\n     of the church. Mrs. Katharine R. Doud was chosen president of the\r\n     convention; Mrs. Olin gave the address of welcome, to which Mrs.\r\n     Sewall responded. Mrs. Doud, in the _Advocate_, thus sums up the\r\n     three days' meetings:\r\n\r\n          During the past week a woman's council has been held in\r\n          Racine, the success of which has been most noticeable. The\r\n          different sessions have been attended by large audiences of\r\n          intelligent men and women, who have very thoughtfully and\r\n          carefully weighed and discussed the various questions under\r\n          consideration.\r\n\r\n          From the beginning to the end there has never been a hitch\r\n          or jar; the myriad wheels of the machinery required to make\r\n          smooth the workings of such large assemblies have moved so\r\n          quietly, and have been so well oiled and in such perfect\r\n          order as to be absolutely unnoticed; really, one might have\r\n          been tempted to feel that the machine had no master, no\r\n          controlling hand.\r\n\r\n          But now that the council is over; now that we can pause and\r\n          begin to estimate the good that has been done; now that the\r\n          seed is sown, from which, please God, a grand harvest shall\r\n          be reaped--now we can look back and see how one brain has\r\n          planned it all. One clear-eyed, far-seeing will gathered\r\n          together these women of genius, who have been with us; one\r\n          practical, mathematical brain made all estimates of expense,\r\n          and accepted all risks of failure; one hospitable heart\r\n          received a house full of guests, and induced others to be\r\n          hospitable likewise; and one earnest, prayerful soul--and\r\n          this the best of all--besought and entreated God's blessing\r\n          upon the work. Need we tell you where to find this\r\n          master-hand which has planned so wisely? the strong will,\r\n          the clear brain, the warm heart, the pure soul? We all know\r\n          her; she is indeed a noble woman, and her name--let us\r\n          whisper lest she hear--is Olympia Brown Willis.\r\n\r\n     The following sketch of the leading events of her life, shows how\r\n     active and useful she has been in all her public and private\r\n     relations:\r\n\r\n          Olympia Brown was born in Kalamazoo county, Michigan,\r\n          January 5, 1835. At the age of fifteen she began to teach\r\n          school during the winter months, attending school herself in\r\n          the summer. At eighteen she entered Holyoke seminary, but\r\n          finding the advantages there inadequate for a thorough\r\n          education, her parents removed, for her benefit, to Yellow\r\n          Springs, Ohio, where she entered Antioch college, Horace\r\n          Mann, one of the best educators of his day, being president.\r\n          There her ambition was thoroughly satisfied, and she was\r\n          graduated with honor in 1860. She then entered Canton\r\n          Theological school, was graduated in 1863, and, duly\r\n          ordained as a Universalist minister, commenced preaching in\r\n          Marshfield and Montpelier, Vermont, often walking fifteen\r\n          miles to fill her appointments. In 1864 she was regularly\r\n          installed over her first parish at Weymouth, Massachusetts.\r\n          Her energy and fidelity soon raised that feeble society into\r\n          one of numbers and influence.\r\n\r\n          In 1869, she accepted a call to Bridgeport, Connecticut,\r\n          where she remained seven years. In 1878, with her husband,\r\n          John Henry Willis, and two children she removed to Racine,\r\n          Wisconsin, where she became pastor of the church of the Good\r\n          Shepherd, without the promise of a dollar. The church had\r\n          been given up as hopeless by several men in succession,\r\n          because of the influence of the Orthodox theological\r\n          seminary. But she soon gathered large audiences and earnest\r\n          members about her; established a Sunday school, had courses\r\n          of lectures in her church during the winter, which she made\r\n          quite profitable financially for the church, beside\r\n          educating the people. Outside her profession she has also\r\n          done a grand work, in temperance and woman suffrage.[429]\r\n          She is rarely out of her own pulpit; has generally been\r\n          superintendent of her own Sunday school, and head of the\r\n          young ladies' club, doing at all times more varied duties\r\n          than any man would deem possible, and with all this she is a\r\n          pattern wife, mother and housekeeper, and her noble husband,\r\n          while carrying on a successful business of his own, stands\r\n          ever ready to second her endeavors with generous aid and\r\n          wise counsel, another instance of the happy homes among the\r\n          \"strong minded.\"\r\n\r\n     Among the estimable women who have been identified with the cause\r\n     of woman suffrage in this country, Mathilde Franziska Anneke, a\r\n     German lady, is worthy of mention:\r\n\r\n          She was born in Westphalia, April 3, 1817. Her childhood was\r\n          passed in happy conditions in a home of luxury, where she\r\n          received a liberal education, yet her married life was\r\n          encompassed with trials and disappointments. From her own\r\n          experiences she learned the injustice of the laws for\r\n          married women and early devoted her pen to the redress of\r\n          their wrongs. Her articles appeared in leading journals of\r\n          Germany and awoke many minds to the consideration of the\r\n          social and civil condition of woman.\r\n\r\n          She was identified with the liberal movement of '48, her\r\n          home being the resort for many of the leaders of the\r\n          revolution. She published a liberal paper which freely\r\n          discussed all the abuses of the government, a whole edition\r\n          of which was destroyed. At length denounced by the\r\n          government, she secretly made here escape from Cologne, and\r\n          joined her husband at the head of his command in active\r\n          preparation for a struggle against the Prussians.\r\n\r\n          She immediately declared her determination to share the\r\n          toils of the expedition. Accordingly Col. Anneke appointed\r\n          her _Tolpfofsort_, the duties of which she continued to\r\n          discharge to the end of the campaign. In one of her works\r\n          published in 1853, she has given a graphic description of\r\n          the disastrous termination of the revolution, of their\r\n          flight into France, of their expulsion from France and\r\n          Switzerland, and of their final determination to come to the\r\n          United States.\r\n\r\n          They reached New York in the fall of 1849. Madame Anneke\r\n          lectured in most of the Eastern cities on the social and\r\n          civil condition of women, claiming for them the right of\r\n          suffrage and more liberal education. She also published a\r\n          woman's journal in New York, and was soon recognized as one\r\n          of the earnest representative women in America. For many\r\n          years she made her home in Milwaukee, where she taught a\r\n          successful school for young ladies. Madame Anneke, a widow\r\n          with one son and two daughters, lived quietly the closing\r\n          years of her life, and in death found the peace and rest she\r\n          had never known in her busy life on earth.\r\n\r\n     Prof. G. S. Albee, president of the State Normal School at\r\n     Oshkosh, is a firm friend and outspoken advocate of equal right\r\n     of the sexes to all the privileges of education, not excepting\r\n     the education of the ballot-box. John Bascom, president of the\r\n     Wisconsin University, has been an advocate of suffrage for women\r\n     many years. While connected with Williams College he worked to\r\n     secure the admission of women thereto. As one of a committee of\r\n     five to whom the matter was referred, he, together with David\r\n     Dudley Field, presented a minority report favoring their\r\n     admission. Since he has been at the head of our State University\r\n     he has been in perfect sympathy with its liberal coeducational\r\n     policy, and has insured to the young women equal advantages in\r\n     every respect with the young men. To his wise management may be\r\n     attributed the success of higher coeducation in Wisconsin. He\r\n     gave an able and scholarly address before our convention at\r\n     Madison in '82, and is always found ready to speak for woman\r\n     suffrage, both in public and private. His influence has done much\r\n     for the advancement of the cause in our State. A cordial letter\r\n     was received from Mrs. Bascom at the last Washington convention,\r\n     which was listened to with interest and prized by the officers of\r\n     the National Association:\r\n\r\n                                      MADISON, Wis., January 16, 1885.\r\n\r\n          MY DEAR MISS ANTHONY: I am sorry I cannot be present and\r\n          meet the many wise and great women who will respond to your\r\n          call for the Seventeenth Annual Convention.\r\n\r\n          What a glorious record these words reveal of unwavering\r\n          faith in the right, and heroic persistency in its pursuit on\r\n          one side, and what blindness of prejudice and selfishness of\r\n          power on the other. The struggle has indeed been a long one,\r\n          and yet no other moral movement involving so many and so\r\n          great social changes ever made more rapid progress. You and\r\n          your fellow-laborers are truly to be congratulated on the\r\n          full and abundant harvest your faithful seed-sowing has\r\n          brought to humanity. The irrational sentiment, based upon\r\n          the methods and customs of barbarous times, is rapidly\r\n          yielding to reason. The world is learning--women are\r\n          learning--that character, even womanly character, does not\r\n          suffer from too much breadth of thought, or from too active\r\n          a sympathy in human interests and human affairs, but is ever\r\n          enriched by a larger circle of ideas, larger experience, and\r\n          more extended activities.\r\n\r\n          The advance of women in position and influence has been\r\n          especially great during the past year, and in directions\r\n          especially cheering and hopeful to the heart of every woman.\r\n          In national political conventions, as your call so justly\r\n          says, she has \"actively participated in the discussion of\r\n          candidates, platforms and principles.\" The last mile-stone\r\n          before the goal has been reached and passed!\r\n\r\n          Your convention will offer the final opportunity to the\r\n          Republican party. Will it be wise enough to seize it for\r\n          self preservation, if not from principle? Will there be\r\n          found in this party enough of spiritual life to lay hold of\r\n          the help now proffered it, and once more renew its strength\r\n          thereby? Or will it, as so repeatedly in the past, turn a\r\n          deaf ear to reason, and still continue to deny the rights of\r\n          half the human family? If so, if it continue deaf, dumb and\r\n          blind, then the Republican party has no longer any function,\r\n          and the power of government will pass forever from its\r\n          hands. The sixteenth amendment to the national constitution\r\n          is coming, but it will be the crown of blessing and of fame\r\n          of another party that will inaugurate this era in social\r\n          life! I take the liberty to send loving greetings to you and\r\n          the convention in the name of our Wisconsin Equal Suffrage\r\n          society. I hope our bright, eloquent Rev. Olympia Brown will\r\n          be with you. Of Wisconsin's eleven representatives in\r\n          congress, I am happy to make honorable mention, as\r\n          broad-minded advocates of our cause, of three, Cameron,\r\n          Price and Stephenson. In earnest sympathy with the object\r\n          and method of the convention, and with high regard for\r\n          yourself, I remain yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                                       EMMA C. BASCOM.\r\n\r\n     In this, as in many other States there was a prolonged struggle\r\n     over the equal rights of women in the courts. The first woman to\r\n     practice law in Wisconsin was Lavinia Goodell. She was admitted\r\n     in the First Judicial Circuit Court, June 17, 1874, Judge H. S.\r\n     Conger, presiding. She commenced practicing in Janesville. The\r\n     following year she had a case which was appealed to the Supreme\r\n     Court. When the appeal was made, Miss Goodell applied to the\r\n     Supreme Court for the right to go with her case. She argued her\r\n     own case and based her claim upon a statute which provides, \"That\r\n     words of the masculine gender may be applied to females; unless\r\n     such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest\r\n     intention of the legislature.\" After she had shown clearly that\r\n     she had an equal right in the courts in an able and unanswerable\r\n     argument, Judge Ryan considered her application for two months\r\n     and rendered an adverse decision. As a result of the agitation\r\n     induced by this case, the legislature of 1877 passed a law that\r\n     \"no person shall be refused admission to the bar of this State on\r\n     account of sex,\" thus showing the power of the legislative branch\r\n     of the government to over-ride all judicial decisions. Miss\r\n     Goodell immediately commenced practice in the Supreme Court. She\r\n     reviewed the judicial decision with keen satire,[430] and ably\r\n     illustrated the comparative capacity of an educated man and woman\r\n     to reason logically on American jurisprudence and constitutional\r\n     law.\r\n\r\n     In the early part of 1879 Kate Kane and Angie J. King were\r\n     admitted to the bar. Miss Kane studied in a law office and in the\r\n     law school of Michigan University. She practiced in Milwaukee\r\n     until 1883, when she located in Chicago. Miss King practices in\r\n     Janesville and was at first associated with Miss Goodell, under\r\n     the name of Goodell & King. Cora Hurtz, Oshkosh, was admitted and\r\n     began practice in 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[418] Mrs. Wolcott is a remarkable woman, of rare intelligence,\r\nkeen moral perceptions and most imposing presence. Much of her\r\nsuccess in life is due no doubt to her gracious manners. Her\r\ngraceful figure, classic face, rich voice and choice language make\r\nher attractive in the best social circles, as well as in the\r\nlaboratory and lecture-room. She is a perfect housekeeper and a\r\nmost hospitable hostess. Having enjoyed many visits at her\r\nbeautiful home I can speak alike of her public and domestic\r\nvirtues.--[E. C.

This was\r\nmost shocking! though widowers, from time immemorial, have\r\npossessed the life-earnings and inheritance of their wives, while\r\nthe dead women's mothers and sisters were starving and freezing\r\nwithin sight of the luxurious homes that rightfully belonged to\r\nthem! It makes a mighty odds whose ox is gored--the widower's or\r\nthe widow's!--[S. B. A.\r\n\r\n[421] In 1867 the governor, General Lucius Fairchild, appointed\r\nLaura J. Ross, M.

Mr. Fallows.\r\n\r\n[425] Miss Lilia Peckham died in Milwaukee, the city of her\r\nresidence. She had been ill but a few weeks, her physicians\r\nconsidering her recovery certain up to within an hour of her death;\r\nbut a sudden and unlooked-for change took place. One of the truest,\r\npurest and best spirits we have ever met has thus passed from earth\r\nto heaven. All who met her soon came to appreciate her gifted\r\nnature, her rare talent and spiritual insight. But only those who\r\nknew her well can bear witness to her wonderful unselfishness, her\r\nremorseless honesty of speech and deed, the loftiness of her ideal\r\nand the beauty of her womanly soul. The Milwaukee _Sentinel_ closes\r\na brief obituary notice of our friend and co-worker as follows:\r\n\r\n\"This talented young woman is well known throughout the country as\r\nan earnest advocate of the woman's rights movement. Only a few\r\nweeks since she made a successful tour through the West, speaking\r\nin various city pulpits. Fearlessly she spoke all that she had come\r\nto feel was truth, though it shook the very foundations of old\r\ncreeds and ideas. Many efforts from her scholarly pen attest to her\r\ndevotion to every onward movement of the hour. She was to have\r\nentered the Cambridge Divinity School early in the present autumn,\r\nhaving chosen the ministry for her life-work. That a life so full\r\nof promise of usefulness should be so suddenly stopped is\r\nirreconcilable with our finite judgment. It is hard to say, 'it is\r\nwell,' though God's fact may be that this young life, with its\r\nbeauty of character, its sisterly affection, its still larger\r\nsisterly sympathy with a suffering humanity, its longings and\r\naspirations, its zealous strivings after the true and good, is full\r\nand complete _now_; still we shall mourn her loss, her brief though\r\nbeautiful career.\"\r\n\r\n[426] The members of the Wisconsin Senate who voted against the\r\nwoman suffrage amendment were: Ackley, Adams, Burrows, Chase,\r\nColeman, Delaney, Flinkelberg, Flint, Kusel, Palmetier, Pingel,\r\nRankin, Ryland, Smith and Van Schaick--15. No better work can be\r\ndone by Wisconsin suffragists than to try to defeat every one of\r\nthem at the next election. The following voted for the measure:\r\nBennett, Crosby, Ellis, Hamilton, Hill, Hudd, Kingston, Meffert,\r\nPhillipps, Scott, Simpson, Wiley, Randall--13. Senators Wing and\r\nMcKeeby were paired, and Senators Erwin and Richardson were absent.\r\n\r\n[427] The officers of the Wisconsin State society for 1885 were:\r\n_President_, Harriet T.

Owing to\r\nits high situation and dry atmosphere the State is a great resort\r\nfor invalids, and nowhere in the world is the sun so bright, the\r\nsky so blue, or the moon and stars so clearly defined. Its early\r\nsettlers were from New England; hence, the church and the\r\nschool-house--monuments of civilization--were the first objects in\r\nthe landscape to adorn those boundless prairies, as the red man was\r\npushed still westward, and the white man seized his hunting-ground.\r\n\r\nThis State is also remarkable for its admirable system of free\r\nschools, in which it is said there is a larger proportion of pupils\r\nto the population than in any other of the Western States. All\r\ninstitutions of learning have from the beginning been open alike to\r\nboys and girls.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sarah Burger Stearns, to whom we are indebted for this\r\nchapter, was one of the first young women to apply for admission to\r\nthe Michigan University.[431] Being denied, she finished her\r\nstudies at the State Normal School, and in 1863 married Mr. O. P.\r\nStearns, a graduate of the institution that barred its doors to\r\nher. Mr. Stearns, at the call of his country, went to the front,\r\nwhile his no less patriotic bride remained at home, teaching in\r\nthe Young Ladies' Seminary at Monroe and lecturing for the benefit\r\nof the Soldiers' Aid Societies.\r\n\r\nThe war over, they removed to Minnesota in 1866, where by lectures,\r\nnewspaper articles, petitions and appeals to the legislature, Mrs.\r\nStearns has done very much to stir the women of the State to\r\nthought and action upon the question of woman's enfranchisement.\r\nShe has been the leading spirit of the State Suffrage Association,\r\nas well as of the local societies of Rochester and Duluth, the two\r\ncities in which she has resided, and also vice-president of the\r\nNational Association since 1876. As a member of the school-board,\r\nshe has wrought beneficent changes in the schools of Duluth. She is\r\nnow at the head of a movement for the establishment of a home for\r\nwomen needing a place of rest and training for self-help and\r\nself-protection. Mrs. Stearns has the full sympathy of her husband\r\nand family, as she had that of her mother, Mrs. Susan C. Burger,\r\nwhose last years were passed in the home of her daughter at Duluth.\r\nMrs. Stearns writes:\r\n\r\n     The advocates of suffrage in Minnesota were so few in the early\r\n     days,[432] and their homes so remote from each other, that there\r\n     was little chance for cooeperation, hence the history of the\r\n     movement in this State consists more of personal efforts than of\r\n     conventions, legislative hearings and judicial decisions. The\r\n     first name worthy of note is that of Harriet E. Bishop. She was\r\n     invited by Rev. Thomas Williamson, M. D., a missionary among the\r\n     Dakotas, to come to his mission home and share in his labors in\r\n     1847, where she was introduced to the leading citizens of St.\r\n     Paul. She was the first teacher of a public school in that\r\n     settlement. She lectured on temperance, wrote for the daily\r\n     papers, and preached as a regular pastor in a Baptist pulpit. She\r\n     published several books, was one of the organizers of the State\r\n     Suffrage Association in 1881, and in 1883 rested from her labors\r\n     on earth.\r\n\r\n     The first lecture in the State on the \"Rights and Wrongs of\r\n     Woman,\" was by Mrs. Mary J. Colburn, in the village of Champlin,\r\n     in 1858, the same year that Minnesota was admitted to the Union.\r\n     In 1864, the State officers promised two prizes for the first and\r\n     second best essays on \"Minnesota as a Home for Emigrants,\"\r\n     reserving to the examining committee the right to reject all\r\n     manuscripts offered if found unworthy. The first prize was\r\n     accorded to Mrs. Colburn. Most of the other competitors were men,\r\n     some of them members of the learned professions. Mrs. Colburn\r\n     says, in writing to a friend, \"I am doing but little now on the\r\n     suffrage question, for I will not stoop longer to ask of any\r\n     congress or legislature for that which I know to be mine by the\r\n     divine law of nature.\"\r\n\r\n     In 1857, Mrs. Jane Grey Swisshelm settled at St. Cloud, where she\r\n     lived until 1863, editing the St. Cloud _Democrat_, the organ of\r\n     the Republican party, and making a heroic fight for freedom and\r\n     equality. In 1860 she spoke in the Hall of Representatives, on\r\n     Anti-slavery; in 1862 she was invited to speak before the Senate\r\n     on woman's rights, and was listened to with great respect.[433]\r\n\r\n     In 1866, at a Fourth of July celebration, Mrs. Stearns accepted\r\n     an invitation to respond to the sentiment, \"Our young and growing\r\n     State; may she ever be an honor to her citizens.\" This offered\r\n     her an opportunity for an off-hand woman suffrage speech, which\r\n     elicited hearty cheers, and gave, as an old gentleman present\r\n     said, \"something fresh to think of and act upon.\" About this time\r\n     the friends of equality began petitioning the legislature for an\r\n     amendment to the constitution, striking out the word \"male.\"\r\n     Through the efforts of Mr. A. G. Spaulding--the editor of the\r\n     _Anoka Star_--and others, these petitions were referred to a\r\n     special committee which granted a hearing to Mrs. Colburn and\r\n     Mrs. Stearns in 1867. Mrs. Colburn read a carefully prepared\r\n     argument, and Mrs. Stearns sent a letter, both of which were\r\n     ordered to be printed. In 1868 a bill was introduced proposing to\r\n     submit the desired amendment, but when brought to a vote it was\r\n     defeated by a majority of one.\r\n\r\n     In March, 1869, _The Revolution_ copied from the Martin County\r\n     _Atlas_ the following:\r\n\r\n          Show us the man who from the bottom of his heart, laying\r\n          aside his prejudices and speaking the unbiased truth, will\r\n          not say that women should have the same rights that he\r\n          himself enjoys, and we will show you a narrow-minded\r\n          sycophant, a cruel, selfish tyrant, or one that has not the\r\n          moral courage to battle for a principle he knows to be just.\r\n          Equal rights before the law is justice to all, and the more\r\n          education we give our children and ourselves, as a people,\r\n          the sooner shall we have equal rights. May the glorious\r\n          cause speed on.\r\n\r\n     In 1869, a suffrage society was organized in the city of\r\n     Rochester, with fifty members, and another at Champlin; the homes\r\n     of Mrs. Stearns and Mrs. Colburn. Petitions were again circulated\r\n     and presented to the legislature early in the session of 1870. It\r\n     had not then been demonstrated by Kansas, Michigan, Colorado,\r\n     Nebraska and Oregon, that the votes of the ignorant classes on\r\n     this question would greatly outnumber those of the intelligent.\r\n     The legislature granted the prayer of the petitioners and passed\r\n     a bill for the submission of an amendment, providing that the\r\n     women of the State, possessing the requisite qualifications,\r\n     should also be allowed to vote upon the proposition, and that\r\n     their votes should be counted as legal. The governor, Hon. Horace\r\n     Austin, vetoed the bill, saying it was not passed in good faith,\r\n     and that the submission of the question at that time would be\r\n     premature. In a private letter to Mrs. Stearns, the governor\r\n     said: \"Had the bill provided for the voting of the women, simply\r\n     to get an expression of their wishes upon the question, without\r\n     requiring their votes to be counted as legal in the adoption or\r\n     rejection of it, the act would not have been vetoed,\r\n     notwithstanding my second objection that it was premature.\"\r\n\r\n     In 1871, petitions to congress were circulated in Minnesota,\r\n     asking a declaratory act to protect the women of the nation in\r\n     the exercise of \"the citizen's right to vote\" under the new\r\n     guarantees of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments. During\r\n     that year the National Woman Suffrage Association appointed Mrs.\r\n     Addie Ballou its vice-president for Minnesota.\r\n\r\n     In 1872 a suffrage club was formed at Kasson. Its three\r\n     originators[434] entered into a solemn compact with each other\r\n     that while they lived in that city there should always be an\r\n     active suffrage society until the ballot for women should be\r\n     obtained. Their secretary, Mrs. H. M. White, writes:\r\n\r\n          Although our club was at first called a ladies' literary\r\n          society, the suspicion that its members wished to vote was\r\n          soon whispered about. Our working members were for some\r\n          years few in number, and our meetings far between. But our\r\n          zeal never abating, we tried in later years many plans for\r\n          making a weekly meeting interesting. The most successful\r\n          was, that every one should bring something that had come to\r\n          her notice during the week, which she should read aloud,\r\n          thus furnishing topics of conversation in which all could\r\n          join. This never failed to make an interesting and\r\n          profitable meeting. And still later we invited speakers from\r\n          other States. In our various courses of lectures, Kasson\r\n          audiences have enjoyed the brave utterances of Anna\r\n          Dickinson, Julia Ward Howe, Susan B. Anthony, and others.\r\n          The pulpit of Kasson we have found about evenly balanced for\r\n          and against us; but those claiming to be friendly generally\r\n          maintained a \"masterly inactivity.\" Our editors have always\r\n          shown us much kindness by gratuitously advertising our\r\n          meetings and publishing our articles. Our members were all\r\n          at the first meeting after school suffrage was granted to\r\n          women, and one lady was elected director for a term of three\r\n          years. The next year another lady was elected. While they\r\n          were members of the board, a new and beautiful school house\r\n          was erected, though some men said, \"nothing in the line of\r\n          building could be safely done until after the women's term\r\n          of office had expired.\" Our co-workers have always treated\r\n          us with great courtesy. In this respect our labors were as\r\n          pleasant as in any church work.\r\n\r\n     At a temperance convention in 1874, a woman suffrage resolution\r\n     was ably defended by Mrs. Julia Ballard Nelson and Mrs. Harriet\r\n     A. Hobart; Mrs. Asa Hutchinson, of beloved memory, also spoke at\r\n     this meeting.\r\n\r\n     As the women in several of the States voted on educational\r\n     matters, the legislature of 1875 wished to confer the same\r\n     privilege upon the women of Minnesota. But instead of doing so by\r\n     direct legislation, as the other States had done, they passed a\r\n     resolution submitting a proposition for an amendment to the\r\n     constitution to the electors of the State, as follows:\r\n\r\n          An amendment to the State constitution giving the\r\n          legislature power to provide by law that any woman of the\r\n          age of twenty-one years and upwards, may vote at any\r\n          election held for the purpose of choosing any officers of\r\n          schools; or upon any measure relating to schools; and also\r\n          that any such woman shall be eligible to hold any office\r\n          pertaining solely to the management of schools.\r\n\r\n     No effort was made to agitate the question, lest more should be\r\n     effected in rousing the opposition than in educating the masses\r\n     in the few months intervening between the passage of the bill and\r\n     the election in November. Mrs. Stearns, however, as the day for\r\n     the decision of the question approached, wishing to make sure of\r\n     the votes of the intelligent men of the State, wrote to the\r\n     editor of the _Pioneer Press_, the leading paper of Minnesota,\r\n     begging him to urge his readers to do all in their power to\r\n     secure the adoption of the amendment. The request was complied\r\n     with, and the editor in a private letter, thanking Mrs. Stearns,\r\n     said he \"had quite forgotten such an amendment had been\r\n     proposed.\"\r\n\r\n     At this last moment the question was, what could be done to\r\n     secure the largest favorable vote. Finding that it would be\r\n     legal, the friends throughout the State appealed to the\r\n     committees of both political parties to have \"For the amendment\r\n     of Article VII. relating to electors--Yes,\" printed upon all\r\n     their tickets. This was very generally done, and thereby the most\r\n     ignorant men were led to vote as they should, with the\r\n     intelligent, in favor of giving women a voice in the education of\r\n     the children of the State, while all who were really opposed\r\n     could scratch the \"yes,\" and substitute a \"no.\" When election day\r\n     came, November 5, 1875, the amendment was carried by a vote of\r\n     24,340 for, to 19,468 against. The following legislature passed\r\n     the necessary law, and at the spring election of 1876, the women\r\n     of Minnesota voted for school officers, and in several cases\r\n     women were elected as directors.\r\n\r\n     I have given these details because the great wonder has been how\r\n     the combined forces of ignorance and vice failed to vote down\r\n     this amendment, as they always have done every other proposition\r\n     for the extension of suffrage to women in this and every other\r\n     State where the question has been submitted to a popular vote. I\r\n     believe our success was largely, if not wholly, attributable to\r\n     our studied failure to agitate the question, and the affirmative\r\n     wording of all the tickets of both parties, by which our\r\n     bitterest opponents forgot the question was to be voted upon, and\r\n     the ignorant classes who could not, or did not read their\r\n     ballots, voted unthinkingly for the measure.\r\n\r\n     In the cities the school officers are elected at the regular\r\n     municipal elections usually held in the spring, while in the\r\n     rural districts and smaller villages they are chosen at school\r\n     meetings in the autumn. In East Minneapolis, Hon. Richard Chute,\r\n     chairman of the Republican nominating convention, having, without\r\n     their knowledge, secured the nomination of Mrs. Charlotte O.\r\n     VanCleve[435] and Mrs. Charlotte S. Winchell[436] as school\r\n     directors, called a meeting of the women of the city to aid in\r\n     their election. It was a large and enthusiastic gathering. Mrs.\r\n     Mary C. Peckham presided, Mrs. Stearns of Duluth, and Mrs.\r\n     Pillsbury, wife of the governor, made stirring speeches, after\r\n     which the candidates were called upon, and responded most\r\n     acceptably. When election day came, the names of Mrs. VanCleve\r\n     and Mrs. Winchell received a handsome majority of the votes of\r\n     their districts. A correspondent in the _Ballot-Box_ said:\r\n\r\n          The women of Minnesota are rejoicing in the measure of\r\n          justice vouchsafed them,--the right to vote and hold office\r\n          in school matters. Two hundred and seventy women voted in\r\n          Minneapolis, the governor's wife among others. Although it\r\n          rained all day they went to the polls in great numbers.\r\n\r\n     Including both East and West Minneapolis, fully 1,000 women\r\n     voted; and while the numbers in other cities and villages were\r\n     not so great, they were composed of the more intelligent. In St.\r\n     Charles, where Dr. Adaline Williams was elected to the\r\n     school-board, some of the gentlemen requested her to resign, on\r\n     the ground that she had not been properly elected. Her reply was,\r\n     \"If I have not been elected, I have no need to resign; and if I\r\n     have been elected, I do not choose to resign.\" But to satisfy\r\n     those who doubted, she proposed that another election should be\r\n     held, which resulted in an overwhelming majority for the Doctor.\r\n\r\n     As the law says women are \"eligible to any office pertaining\r\n     solely to the management of schools,\" one might be elected as\r\n     State superintendent of public instruction. There have been many\r\n     women elected to the office of county superintendent, and in\r\n     several counties they have been twice reelected,[437] and\r\n     wherever women have held school offices, they have been reported\r\n     as doing efficient service. Although the law provided that women\r\n     might \"vote at any election for the purpose of choosing any\r\n     officers of schools,\" the attorney-general gave an opinion that\r\n     it did not entitle them to vote for county superintendent; hence\r\n     \"an act to entitle women to vote for county superintendent of\r\n     schools,\" was passed by the legislature of 1885.\r\n\r\n     The ladies' city school committee. Miss A. M. Henderson,\r\n     chairman, secured the appointment of a committee of seven women\r\n     in Minneapolis, to meet with a like number of men from each of\r\n     the political parties, to select such members of the school-board\r\n     as all could agree upon. Having thus aided in the nominations,\r\n     women were interested in their election. In 1881 Mrs. Merrill and\r\n     Miss Henderson stood at the polls all day and electioneered for\r\n     their candidates. It was said that their efforts not only decided\r\n     the choice of school officers, but elected a temperance alderman.\r\n     In many cities of the State the temperance women exert a great\r\n     influence at the polls in persuading men to vote for the best\r\n     town-officers. At the special election held in Duluth for\r\n     choosing school officers, one of the judges of election, and the\r\n     clerks at each of the polling places have for the last two years\r\n     been women who were teachers in our public schools.\r\n\r\n     The early homestead law of Minnesota illustrates how easily men\r\n     forget to bestow the same rights upon women that they carefully\r\n     secure to themselves. In 1869, the \"protectors of women\" enacted\r\n     a law which exempted a homestead from being sold for the payment\r\n     of debts so long as the man who held it might live, while it\r\n     allowed his widow and children to be turned out penniless and\r\n     homeless. It was not until 1875 that this law was so amended that\r\n     the exemption extended to the widow and fatherless children.\r\n\r\n     In 1877, a law was passed which gave the widow an absolute\r\n     title--or the same title her husband had--to one-third of all the\r\n     real estate, exclusive of the homestead, and of that, it gave her\r\n     the use, during her lifetime. So that now the widow has the\r\n     absolute ownership, instead of the life use of one-third of\r\n     whatever she and her husband may have together earned and saved.\r\n     That is, should there be any real estate left, over and above the\r\n     homestead, after paying all the husband's debts, she now has, not\r\n     merely the difference, as heretofore, between the amount of the\r\n     tax and the income on one-third, but she may avoid the tax and\r\n     other costs of keeping it, by selling her third, if she prefers,\r\n     and putting the money at interest. The law still puts whatever\r\n     may be left of the other two-thirds, after payment of debts, into\r\n     the hands of the probate judge and others, and the interest\r\n     thereof, or even the principal, may go to reward them for their\r\n     services, or, if falling into honest hands, it may be left for\r\n     the support and education of the children.\r\n\r\n     The legislature of 1877 submitted a constitutional amendment\r\n     giving women a vote on the temperance question. This seemed\r\n     likely to be carried by default of agitation, as was that of\r\n     school suffrage, until within a few weeks of the election, when\r\n     the liquor interest combined all its forces of men and money and\r\n     defeated it by a large majority. The next year the temperance\r\n     people made a strong effort to get the proposition re-submitted,\r\n     but to no purpose.\r\n\r\n     In 1879, acting upon the plan proposed to all the States by the\r\n     National Association, we petitioned for the adoption of a joint\r\n     resolution asking congress to submit to the several State\r\n     legislatures an amendment to the National constitution,\r\n     prohibiting the disfranchisement of woman. Mrs. Stearns and\r\n     others followed up the petitions with letters to the most\r\n     influential members, in which they argued that the legislatures\r\n     of the States, not the rank and file of the electors, ought to\r\n     decide this question; and further, that the same congress that\r\n     had granted woman the privilege of pleading a case before the\r\n     Supreme Court of the United States would doubtless pass a\r\n     resolution submitting to the legislatures the decision of the\r\n     question of her right to have her opinion on all questions\r\n     counted at the ballot-box. The result was a majority of six in\r\n     the Senate in favor of the resolution, while in the House there\r\n     was a majority of five against it.\r\n\r\n     Since 1879, our legislature has met biennially. In 1881 the\r\n     temperance women of the State again petitioned for the right to\r\n     vote on the question of licensing the sale of liquor. Failing to\r\n     get that, or a prohibitory law, they became more than ever\r\n     convinced of the necessity of full suffrage. The annual meetings\r\n     of the State Union[438] have ever since been spoken of by the\r\n     press as \"suffrage conventions,\" because they always pass\r\n     resolutions making the demand.\r\n\r\n     Mr. L. Bixby, editor of the _State Temperance Review_, gives\r\n     several columns to the temperance and suffrage societies. Mrs.\r\n     Helen E. Gallinger, the editor of these departments, is a lady of\r\n     great ability and earnestness. Mr. Charles H. Dubois, editor of\r\n     _The Spectator_, gives ample space in his columns to notes of\r\n     women. Miss Mary C. Le Duc is connected with _The Spectator_.\r\n     Other journals have aided our cause, though not in so pronounced\r\n     a way. Mrs. C. F. Bancroft, editor of the _Mantorville Express_,\r\n     and Mrs. Bella French, of a county paper at Spring Valley, Mrs.\r\n     Annie Mitchell, the wife of one editor and the mother of another,\r\n     for many years their business associate, have all given valuable\r\n     services to our cause, while pecuniarily benefiting themselves.\r\n     The necessity of finding a voice when something needed to be\r\n     said, and of using a pen when something needed to be written, has\r\n     developed considerable talent for public speaking and writing\r\n     among the women of this State.[439]\r\n\r\n     All our State institutions are favorable to coeducation, and give\r\n     equal privileges to all. The Minnesota University has been open\r\n     to women since its foundation, and from 1875 to 1885 fifty-six\r\n     young women were graduated with high honor to themselves and\r\n     their sex.[440] Miss Maria L. Sanford has been professor of\r\n     rhetoric and elocution for many years. The faculties of the State\r\n     Normal Schools are largely composed of women. Hamline University\r\n     and Carlton College are conducted on principles of true equality.\r\n     At Carlton Miss Margaret Evans is preceptress and teacher of\r\n     modern languages. Of the Rochester High School, Miss Josephine\r\n     Hegeman is principal; of Wasioga, Miss C. T. Atwood; of Eyota\r\n     Union School, Miss Adell M'Kinley.[441]\r\n\r\n     For many years Mrs. M. R. Smith was employed as State Librarian.\r\n     Mrs. H. J. M'Caine for the past ten years has been librarian at\r\n     St. Paul, with Miss Grace A. Spaulding as assistant. Among the\r\n     engrossing and enrolling clerks of our legislature, Miss Alice\r\n     Weber is the only lady's name we find, though the men holding\r\n     those offices usually employ a half dozen women to assist them in\r\n     copying, allowing each two-thirds of the price paid by the State,\r\n     or ten cents per folio.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sarah Burger Stearns]\r\n\r\n\r\n     In this State the suffrage cause has had the sympathy of not a\r\n     few noble women in the successful practice of the healing art;\r\n     thus lending their influence for the political emancipation of\r\n     their sex, while blessing the community with their medical skill.\r\n     To Doctors Hood and Whetstone is due the credit of establishing\r\n     the Northwestern Hospital for Women and Children, and training\r\n     school for nurses, of which they are now the attending\r\n     physicians; and Dr. Hood also attends the Bethany Home, founded\r\n     by the sisterhood of Bethany, for the benefit of friendless girls\r\n     and women. In the town of Detroit may be seen a drug store neatly\r\n     fitted up, with \"Ogden's Pharmacy\" over the door, and upon it, in\r\n     gilt letters, \"Emma K. Ogden, M. D.\" While the doctor practices\r\n     her profession, she employs a young woman as prescription clerk.\r\n     The Minnesota State Medical Society has admitted nine women to\r\n     membership.[442]\r\n\r\n     Conspicuous among evangelists in this State are Mrs. Mary C.\r\n     Nind, Minneapolis, Mrs. Mary A. Shepardson, Wasioga, Mrs. Ruth\r\n     Cogswell Rowell, Winona, and Rev. Eliza Tupper Wilkes, Rochester.\r\n\r\n     Thus far this chapter has been given mainly to individuals in the\r\n     State, and to the home influences that have aided in creating\r\n     sentiment in favor of full suffrage for woman. United with these\r\n     have been other influences coming like the rays of the morning\r\n     sun directly from the East where so many noble women are at work\r\n     for the freedom of their sex. Among them are some of the most\r\n     popular lecturers in the country.[443]\r\n\r\n     In September, 1881, representative women from various localities\r\n     met at Hastings and organized a State Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association[444] auxiliary to the National. During the first year\r\n     one hundred and twenty-four members were enrolled. During the\r\n     second the membership more than doubled. In October, 1882, the\r\n     association held its first annual meeting. The audiences were\r\n     large, and the speakers[445] most heartily applauded. Mrs. Nelson\r\n     presided. In her letter of greeting to this meeting, from which\r\n     ill-health obliged her to be absent, the president urged the\r\n     association to firmly adhere to the principles of the National\r\n     Association. Let us not ask for an amendment to the State\r\n     constitution, and thus put it in the power of ignorance and\r\n     prejudice to deny the boon we seek; while we are auxiliary to the\r\n     National let us work according to its plans. Mrs. Stearns was\r\n     unanimously reelected president, and her views heartily endorsed.\r\n\r\n     In the spring of '83, at the request of the State society, and\r\n     with the generous consent of Mr. Bixby, the editor of the _State\r\n     Temperance Review_, Mrs. Helen E. Gallinger commenced editing a\r\n     woman suffrage column in that paper. This has been a very\r\n     convenient medium of communication between the State society and\r\n     the local auxiliaries which have since been organized by Mrs. L.\r\n     May Wheeler, who was employed as lecturer and organizer,[446] in\r\n     the summer and fall of 1883. Auxiliary societies had previously\r\n     been organized by Mrs. Stearns, in St. Paul and Minneapolis. The\r\n     Kasson society, formed in 1872, also became auxiliary to the\r\n     State.\r\n\r\n     During the Northwestern Industrial Exhibition, held in\r\n     Minneapolis August, 1883, a woman suffrage headquarters was\r\n     fitted up on the fair-grounds, in a fine large tent, made\r\n     attractive by flags, banners and mottoes. The State and local\r\n     societies were represented, officers and members being there to\r\n     receive all who were in sympathy, to talk suffrage to opposers,\r\n     to pass out good leaflets, and to exhibit copies of the Woman\r\n     Suffrage History. At the annual convention this year we were\r\n     honored by the presence of Julia Ward Howe and Mrs. Marianna\r\n     Folsom of Iowa, and many of the clergymen[447] of Minneapolis.\r\n     Rev. E. S. Williams gave the address of welcome, and paid a\r\n     beautiful tribute to the self-sacrificing leaders in this holy\r\n     crusade. Mrs. Howe not only encouraged us with her able words of\r\n     cheer, but she presided at the piano while her Battle Hymn of the\r\n     Republic was sung, and seemed to give it new inspiration. In the\r\n     course of her remarks the president said:\r\n\r\n          Should congress finally adopt that long-pending amendment in\r\n          the winter of 1883-4 enfranchising women, we should still\r\n          have work to do in 1885 to secure the ratification of this\r\n          amendment by our State legislature. But should congress\r\n          still refuse, let us be thankful that the way is opening for\r\n          women to secure their freedom by the power of the\r\n          legislature independent of all constitutional amendments, as\r\n          there is nothing in ordinary State constitutions to prevent\r\n          legislators from extending suffrage to women by legislative\r\n          enactment. The constitution of the State of Minnesota simply\r\n          enfranchises men, and does not even mention women; we have\r\n          clearly nothing to do but to convince our legislators that\r\n          they are free to give educated women full suffrage.\r\n\r\n     With this view the society adopted the following resolution:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That we accept with joy the argument that comes\r\n          to us from the east and from the west declaring suffrage\r\n          amendments to State constitutions unnecessary, because the\r\n          word \"male,\" occurring as it does in most State\r\n          constitutions, in no wise restrains legislatures from\r\n          extending full suffrage to women, should they feel inclined\r\n          to do so. Be it also\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That it therefore becomes our duty to talk with\r\n          all men and women who are friendly to our cause, and ask\r\n          them to examine the argument, and if it commends itself to\r\n          their judgment, to give us the benefit of their convictions.\r\n\r\n     Though passing the above resolutions at that time, the State\r\n     Association of course waits to see what may be done, in view of\r\n     this new idea, by older and stronger States whose constitutions\r\n     are similar to ours. Although failing health induced Mrs.\r\n     Stearns, in the fall of 1883, to resign her suffrage work into\r\n     other hands, and ask to be excused from any office whatever, she\r\n     has, with improving health lately accepted the presidency of an\r\n     Equal Rights League in Duluth. Dr. Ripley was not present\r\n     herself at the convention[448] which chose her for president for\r\n     the ensuing year, being then at the East, but immediately after\r\n     returning, she entered upon her new duties with enthusiasm. As\r\n     there was to be no legislature in 1884, there could be no\r\n     petitioning, except to continue the work commenced as long ago as\r\n     1871, of petitioning congress for a sixteenth amendment. The work\r\n     was carried on with vigor, and many hundreds of names obtained in\r\n     a short time. Early in 1884 Mrs. L. May Wheeler continued to\r\n     lecture in the interests of the suffrage cause. While so engaged\r\n     she issued her \"Collection of Temperance and Suffrage Melodies.\"\r\n\r\n     In 1884 a woman suffrage headquarters was again fitted up in\r\n     Newspaper Row, on the grounds of the Northwestern Industrial\r\n     Exhibition. The large tent was shared by the State W. C. T. U.,\r\n     and appropriately decked within and without to represent both of\r\n     the State organizations and their auxiliaries. A large amount of\r\n     suffrage and temperance literature was distributed among the many\r\n     who were attracted by the novelty of the sight and sentiments\r\n     displayed on banners and flags.\r\n\r\n     As Minneapolis had already become headquarters for the suffrage\r\n     work of the State, it was thought best to again hold the annual\r\n     meeting in that city. This was in October, continuing two days,\r\n     and was both interesting and encouraging. Dr. Martha G. Ripley\r\n     presided. Many interesting letters were read, and cheering\r\n     telegrams received.[449] Miss Marion Lowell recited \"The Legend,\"\r\n     by Mary Agnes Ticknor, and \"Was he Henpecked?\" by Phebe Cary,\r\n     Mrs. A. M. Tyng of Austin, made a good speech, also recited a\r\n     poem entitled \"Jane Conquest.\" Mr. Lars Oure of Norway, spoke\r\n     well upon the \"Claims of Woman.\" Dr. L. W. Denton of Minneapolis,\r\n     gave a very good address. Dr. Martha G. Ripley spoke on suffrage\r\n     as a natural right, and in support of this view read extracts\r\n     from a pamphlet entitled, \"Woman Suffrage a Right, and not a\r\n     Privilege,\" by Wm. I. Bowditch; Eliza Burt Gamble of St. Paul,\r\n     read a very able paper on \"Woman and the Church\"; Mrs. Stearns\r\n     spoke upon the new era to be inaugurated when women have the\r\n     ballot. Miss Emma Harriman read a bright and entertaining paper.\r\n     The fine address of the occasion was given by Rev. W. W.\r\n     Satterlee, showing the nation's need of woman's vote. Judge and\r\n     Mrs. Hemiup, of Minneapolis, just returned from a visit to\r\n     Wyoming Territory, were present. The judge made several speeches,\r\n     and was enthusiastic in his praise of the workings of woman\r\n     suffrage there. He and his wife are now active members of the\r\n     State and city (Minneapolis) suffrage societies. The judge is\r\n     also a member of the State executive committee.\r\n\r\n     Wishing to give honor to whom honor is due, we would mention the\r\n     brave young women who have formed the Christian Temperance\r\n     Unions, the leading spirits[450] in this grand movement in\r\n     Minneapolis, St. Paul, Winona and St. Cloud. Their names will be\r\n     usually found as delegates to the annual meetings of all the\r\n     State Unions. The small army of noble girls who have helped to\r\n     make the Good Templars' lodges attractive and worthy resorts for\r\n     their brothers and friends, have done an inestimable work in\r\n     elevating the moral tone of the community all over the State.\r\n     They have also done their full share in petitioning congress for\r\n     a sixteenth amendment, in which they have received most untiring\r\n     help from the young men of the lodges. In 1884 Miss Frances\r\n     Willard again visited the State, advocating the ballot as well as\r\n     the Bible as an aid to temperance work. Her eloquent voice here\r\n     as elsewhere woke many to serious thought on the danger of this\r\n     national vice to the safety and stability of our republican\r\n     institutions. It was through Miss Willard's influence, no doubt,\r\n     that the friends of temperance established a department of\r\n     franchise for the State, and made Mrs. E. L. Crockett its\r\n     superintendent.\r\n\r\n     The women of Minnesota seem thus far to have no special calling\r\n     to the legal profession. Mrs. Martha Angle Dorsett is the only\r\n     woman as yet admitted to the bar. She was graduated from the law\r\n     school at Des Moines, and admitted to practice before the Supreme\r\n     Court of Iowa in June, 1876. She was refused admission at first\r\n     in Minnesota, whereupon she appealed to the legislature, which in\r\n     1877 enacted a law securing the right to women by a vote of 63 to\r\n     30 in the House, and 26 to 6 in the Senate.\r\n\r\n     In some of the larger cities and towns the literary, musical and\r\n     dramatic taste of our women[451] is evidenced by societies and\r\n     clubs for mutual improvement. Many are attending classes for the\r\n     study of natural history, classic literature, social science,\r\n     etc. There is an art club in Minneapolis, composed wholly of\r\n     artists, both ladies and gentlemen, which meets every week, the\r\n     members making sketches from life. Miss Julie C. Gauthier had on\r\n     exhibition at the New Orleans Exposition, a full-length portrait,\r\n     true to life, of a colored man, \"Pony,\" a veteran wood-sawer of\r\n     St. Paul, which received very complimentary notices from art\r\n     critics of that city, as well as from the press generally.\r\n\r\n     In the Business Colleges of Mr. Curtis at St. Paul and\r\n     Minneapolis, many women are teachers, and many more are educated\r\n     as shorthand reporters, telegraphers, and book-keepers. These\r\n     have no difficulty in finding places after completing their\r\n     college course. Nearly fifty young women are employed in the\r\n     principal towns of the State as telegraphers alone. Miss Mary M.\r\n     Cary has been employed for seven years as operator and station\r\n     agent at Wayzata, for the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba R. R.\r\n     Her services are highly valued, as well they may be, for during\r\n     her absence from the station two men are required to do her work.\r\n     By her talents and industry she has acquired a thorough education\r\n     for herself, besides educating her two younger sisters. Mrs. Anna\r\n     B. Underwood of Lake City, has for many years been secretary of a\r\n     firm conducting a large nursery of fruit trees, plants and\r\n     flowers. Her husband being one of the partners, she has taken a\r\n     large share of the general management. The orchard yields a\r\n     profit of over $1,000 a year.\r\n\r\n     From the list of names to be found in the Appendix, we see that\r\n     Minnesota is remarkable for its galaxy of superior women actively\r\n     engaged as speakers and writers[452] in many reforms, as well as\r\n     in the trades and professions, and in varied employments. One of\r\n     the great advantages of pioneer life is the necessity to man of\r\n     woman's help in all the emergencies of these new conditions in\r\n     which their forces and capacities are called into requisition.\r\n     She thus acquires a degree of self-reliance, courage and\r\n     independence, that would never be called out in older\r\n     civilizations, and commands a degree of respect from the men at\r\n     her side that can only be learned in their mutual dependence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[431] The names of the young women who applied for admission to the\r\nclassical course of the Michigan State University, in 1858, were\r\nSarah Burger, Clara Norton, Ellen F. Thompson, Ada A. Alvord, Rose\r\nAnderson, Helen White, Amanda Kieff, Lizzie Baker, Nellie Baker,\r\nAnna Lathrop, Carrie Felch, Mary Becker, Adeline Ladd and Harriet\r\nPatton.\r\n\r\n[432] See Appendix, Chapter XLVII., note A.\r\n\r\n[433] For further account of Mrs. Swisshelm's patriotic work in\r\nMinnesota see her \"Reminiscences of Half a Century\": Janson,\r\nMcClurg & Co., Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\n[434] The three women were, Mrs. Almira W. Anthony (whose husband\r\nwas a cousin of Susan B. Anthony), Mrs. Mary Powell Wheeler and\r\nMrs. Hattie M. White.\r\n\r\n[435] In a volume of Minnesota biography, Mrs. VanCleve is reported\r\nas a woman of great force of character, strong in her convictions\r\nof what is right, and fearless in following the dictates of her\r\nconscience. She was one of the original founders of the Sisterhood\r\nof Bethany, a society for the reformation of unfortunate women, and\r\nhas held the position of president since its formation. Through the\r\nmedium of lectures and social influence, she has enlisted the\r\nsympathy of a large number of the community. She has served\r\nfaithfully as a member of the East Minneapolis board of education,\r\nand has always improved every opportunity to advocate the right of\r\nsuffrage for women. She is a member of the State Suffrage Society,\r\nand has been for many years honorary vice-president for this State,\r\nof the National Suffrage Association. The following interesting\r\nfact is told of her, on the authority of Major-General R. W.\r\nJohnson. It was given in an address delivered by that gentleman\r\nbefore the old settlers' association of Hennepin county, at a\r\nreunion in the city of Minneapolis: Many years ago a soldier at\r\nFort Snelling received an injury to his feet, and mortification\r\nensued. Amputation became necessary and the case could not be\r\npostponed until a surgeon could be sent for, because there was none\r\nnearer than the post-surgeon at Prairie du Chien. No gentleman in\r\nthe garrison was willing to undertake so difficult an operation.\r\nEqual to any emergency, Mrs. VanCleve, on hearing of the case,\r\nresolved to make the attempt. She performed the operation\r\nskillfully, and saved the soldier's life.\r\n\r\n[436] Mrs. Charlotte S. Winchell was a graduate of Albion College,\r\nMichigan, and came to this State in 1873, with her husband, Prof.\r\nNewton H. Winchell, widely known as Minnesota's State geologist.\r\nMrs. Winchell has always been an advocate of suffrage for woman,\r\nand cheerfully accepted the position on the school board, serving\r\nas clerk. She took an active part in the nominations and elections\r\nof school officers. She was chairman of the committee for\r\nintroducing temperance text books into the schools, secretary of\r\nthe Woman's Board of Foreign Missions, a member of the State and\r\nCity Suffrage Societies, and of the Association for the Advancement\r\nof Women.\r\n\r\n[437] For names of women elected as school directors and county\r\nsuperintendents, see Appendix to Minnesota, Chapter XLVII., Note B.\r\n\r\n[438] The officers of the Minnesota State W.

Hence, one might naturally\r\nlook for liberal ideas among a people surrounded with such vast\r\npossessions as are in the territory of Dakota. But alas! there\r\nseems to be no correspondence in this republic between areas and\r\nconstitutions. Although Dakota comprises 96,595,840 acres, yet\r\none-half her citizens are defrauded of their rights precisely as\r\nthey are in the little States of Delaware and Rhode Island. The\r\ninhabitants denied the right of suffrage by their territorial\r\nconstitution are, the Indians not taxed (a hint that those who pay\r\ntaxes vote), idiots, convicts and women. But from records sent us\r\nby Mrs. Marietta Bones, to whom we are indebted for this chapter,\r\nthere seem to have been some spasmodic climatic influences at work,\r\nthough not sufficiently strong as yet to get that odious word\r\n\"male\" out of the constitution. Our Dakota historian says:\r\n\r\n     The territorial legislature, in the year 1872, came within one\r\n     vote of enfranchising women. That vote was cast by Hon. W. W.\r\n     Moody, who, let it be said to his credit, most earnestly espoused\r\n     the cause in our constitutional convention in 1883, and said in\r\n     the course of his remarks: \"Are not my wife and daughter as\r\n     competent to vote as I am to hold office?\" which question caused\r\n     prolonged laughter among the most ignorant of the delegates, and\r\n     cries of, \"You're right, Judge!\" Although it is deeply to be\r\n     regretted that through one vote twelve years ago our women were\r\n     deprived of freedom, yet we must forgive Judge Moody on the\r\n     ground that \"it is never too late to mend.\"\r\n\r\n     In February, 1879, the legislature revised the school law, and\r\n     provided that women should vote at school meetings. That law was\r\n     repealed in March, 1883, by the school township law, which\r\n     requires regular polls and a private ballot, so, of course,\r\n     excluding women from the small privilege given them in 1879. That\r\n     act, however, excepted fifteen counties[453]--the oldest and most\r\n     populous--which had districts fully established, and therein\r\n     women still vote at school meetings.\r\n\r\n     In townships which are large and have many schools under one\r\n     board and no districts, the people select which school they\r\n     desire their children to attend. The persons who may so select\r\n     are parents: first, the father; next, the mother, if there be no\r\n     father living; guardians (women or men), and \"persons having in\r\n     charge children of school age.\" These persons hold a meeting\r\n     annually of their \"school,\" and such women vote there, and one of\r\n     them may be chosen moderator for the school, to hold one year.\r\n     This office is a sort of responsible agency for the school, and\r\n     between it and the township board.\r\n\r\n     Since the legislation upon the subject of school suffrage there\r\n     has not been much work done for the promotion of the cause. The\r\n     wide distances between towns and the sparsely settled country\r\n     make our people comparative strangers to each other. We lack\r\n     organization; the country is too new; in fact, the most and only\r\n     work for woman suffrage has been done by Matilda Joslyn Gage and\r\n     myself, and, owing to disadvantages mentioned, that has been but\r\n     little. Mrs. Gage reached Dakota just at the close of the Huron\r\n     convention, held in June, 1883, to discuss the question of\r\n     territorial division. The resolutions of the convention declared\r\n     that just governments derived their powers from the consent of\r\n     the governed; that Dakota possessed a population of 200,000,\r\n     women included; that the people of a territory have the right, in\r\n     their sovereign capacity, to adopt a constitution and form a\r\n     State government. Accordingly, a convention was called for the\r\n     purpose of enabling those residing in that part of Dakota south\r\n     of the forty-sixth parallel to organize a State. Mrs. Gage at\r\n     once addressed a letter to the women of the territory and to the\r\n     constitutional convention assembled at Sioux Falls:\r\n\r\n          _To the Women of Dakota:_\r\n\r\n          A convention of men will assemble at Sioux Falls, September\r\n          4, for the purpose of framing a constitution and pressing\r\n          upon congress the formation of a State of the southern half\r\n          of the territory. This is the moment for women to act; it is\r\n          the decisive moment. There can never again come to the women\r\n          of Dakota an hour like the present. A constitution is the\r\n          fundamental law of the State; upon it all statute laws are\r\n          based, and upon the fact whether woman is inside or outside\r\n          the pale of the constitution, her rights in the State\r\n          depend.\r\n\r\n          The code of Dakota, under the head of \"Personal Relations,\"\r\n          says: \"The husband is the head of the family. He may choose\r\n          any reasonable place, or mode of living, and the wife must\r\n          conform thereto.\" Under this class legislation, which was\r\n          framed by man entirely in his own interests, the husband\r\n          may, and in many cases does, file a preemption claim, build\r\n          a shanty, and place his wife upon the ground as \"a\r\n          reasonable place and mode of living,\" while he remains in\r\n          town in pursuit of business or pleasure.\r\n\r\n          Let us examine this condition of affairs a little closer. If\r\n          the wife is not pleased with this \"place and mode of\r\n          living,\" but should leave it, she is, under this law of\r\n          class legislation, liable to be advertised as having left\r\n          the husband's bed and board, wherefore he will pay no debts\r\n          of her contracting. And how is it if she remains on this\r\n          until her continued residence upon it has enabled her\r\n          husband to prove up? Does she then share in its benefits? Is\r\n          she then half owner of the land? By no means. Chapter 3,\r\n          section 83, article V. of the Code, says: \"No estate is\r\n          allowed the husband or tenant by courtesy upon the death of\r\n          his wife, nor is any estate in dower allowed to the wife\r\n          upon the death of the husband.\"\r\n\r\n          This article carries a specious fairness on its face, but it\r\n          is a bundle of wrongs to woman. By the United States law,\r\n          only \"the head of the family\" is allowed to enter\r\n          lands--either a preemption, homestead or tree claim. In\r\n          unison with the United States, the law of Dakota (see\r\n          chapter 3, section 76) recognizes the husband as the head of\r\n          the family, and then declares that no estate in dower is\r\n          allowed to the wife upon the death of her husband. Neither\r\n          has she any claim upon any portion of this land the husband,\r\n          as head of the family, may take, except the homestead, in\r\n          which she is recognized as joint owner. The preemption claim\r\n          upon which, in a comfortless claim-shanty, she may have\r\n          lived for six months, or longer, if upon unsurveyed land, as\r\n          \"the reasonable place and mode of living\" her husband has\r\n          selected for her, does not belong to her at all. She has no\r\n          part nor share in it. Upon proving, her husband may at once\r\n          sell, or deed it away as a gift, and she has no redress. It\r\n          was not hers. The law so declares; but she is her husband's,\r\n          to the extent that she can be thus used to secure 160 acres\r\n          of land for him, over which she has no right, title, claim\r\n          or interest. I have not space to pursue this subject\r\n          farther, but will assure the women of Dakota that reading\r\n          the code, and the session laws of the territory will be more\r\n          interesting to them than any novel. If they wish to still\r\n          farther know their wrongs, let them look in the code under\r\n          the heads of \"Parent and Child,\" \"Crimes Defined,\" \"Probate\r\n          Court,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\n          Every woman in Dakota should be immediately at work.\r\n          Inasmuch as the constitution is the fundamental law of the\r\n          State, it should be the effort of the women of Dakota to\r\n          prevent the introduction of the restrictive word \"male.\" The\r\n          delegates to the Sioux Falls convention have now largely\r\n          been elected. Address letters of protest to them against\r\n          making the constitution an organ of class legislation. In as\r\n          far as possible have personal interviews with these\r\n          delegates, and by speech make known your wishes on this\r\n          point. These are your only methods of representation. You\r\n          have in no way signified your desire for a constitution. You\r\n          have not been permitted to help make these laws which rob\r\n          you of property, and many other things more valuable. Many\r\n          women are settling in Dakota. Unmarried women and widows in\r\n          large numbers are taking up claims here, and their property\r\n          is taxed to help support the government and the men who make\r\n          these iniquitous laws.\r\n\r\n          I have not mentioned a thousandth part of the wrongs done\r\n          woman by her being deprived of the right of self-government.\r\n          Every injustice under which she suffers, as wife, mother,\r\n          woman, child, in property and person, is due to the fact\r\n          that she is not recognized as man's political equal--and her\r\n          only power is that of protest. Lose not a moment, then,\r\n          women of Dakota, in objecting to the introduction of the\r\n          word \"male\" into the proposed new constitution. Besides\r\n          seeing and writing to delegates, make effort to be present\r\n          at Sioux Falls during the time of the convention, to labor\r\n          with delegates from distant points, and to go before\r\n          committees, and the convention itself, with your protests.\r\n          Above all, remember that _now_ is the decisive hour.\r\n\r\n                    MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, _Vice-President-at-Large_,\r\n                       _National Woman Suffrage Association_.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Gage also addressed the following to the constitutional\r\n     convention:\r\n\r\n          _Gentlemen of the Convention_: The work upon which you are\r\n          now engaged is an important one in the interests of liberty,\r\n          that of framing a constitution for a proposed new State. As\r\n          a constitution is the fundamental law, its provisions should\r\n          be general in their character, equally recognizing the\r\n          rights of all its citizens by its protective powers. Our\r\n          National principle, that governments derive their just\r\n          powers from the consent of the governed, is becoming more\r\n          and more widely recognized.\r\n\r\n          At an early day suffrage was restricted by qualifications of\r\n          property and education in many of the States, and the\r\n          removal of such restrictions has been left entirely to the\r\n          States, except in the one instance of color. Within the last\r\n          two decades, by amendments to the national constitution, all\r\n          States are forbidden to exclude citizens from the ballot\r\n          upon that account.\r\n\r\n          As \"sex\" is now the only remaining disqualification, on\r\n          behalf of the National Woman Suffrage Association I ask you\r\n          to omit the word \"male\" from your proposed constitution, and\r\n          leave the women of Dakota free to exercise the right of\r\n          suffrage. We simply ask you to make your State a true\r\n          republic, in which all your citizens may stand equal before\r\n          the law. While foreign men of every nation are welcomed to\r\n          your magnificent prairies as equals, it is humiliating to\r\n          the women of the territory, who are helping you to develop\r\n          its resources, who have endured with you all the hardships\r\n          of pioneer life, to be treated as inferiors, outside the\r\n          pale of political consideration. It should be the pride of\r\n          Dakota to take the initiative step in the legislation of the\r\n          period, now steadily growing more liberal, and by one\r\n          generous and graceful act accord to the women of this\r\n          territory all the rights, privileges and immunities that men\r\n          claim for themselves.\r\n\r\n                                          MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE,\r\n                                _Vice-President-at-Large, N. W. S. A._\r\n\r\n          _Aberdeen, Dakota, Sept. 3, 1883._\r\n\r\n     It is to be regretted that the argument presented by Mrs. Gage\r\n     could not convince that honorable body of the injustice of laws\r\n     towards woman. To me was given the privilege of addressing the\r\n     convention. I said:\r\n\r\n          _Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Convention_: The honor\r\n          conferred on me, of being allowed to address you on this\r\n          important occasion is fully appreciated. I am here in behalf\r\n          of the women of our territory, who are opposed to being left\r\n          in the State organization with no more authority in the\r\n          government than paupers, lunatics and idiots. We are willing\r\n          to do one-half of the manual labor in this country, and will\r\n          promptly pay our portion of the taxes. As sober and peaceful\r\n          citizens, we compare favorably with the other sex. I have\r\n          the honor to present to you a petition signed by hundreds of\r\n          Day county voters, praying your honorable body not to allow\r\n          the word \"male\" to be incorporated within our State\r\n          constitution. There is no doubt that this petition speaks\r\n          the honest sentiment of the people throughout the territory.\r\n          In but a single instance was I refused a name, and in a\r\n          second case a man hesitated, saying, \"Well, now, if it's as\r\n          many rights you're wantin' es I hev got fur meself, you'll\r\n          be after signin' my name fur me--fur I niver do any writin'\r\n          at all fur meself.\" And yet that man whose name I had to\r\n          write has more rights in this, his adopted country, than I\r\n          and all other women have in this our native land. The right\r\n          of franchise, which has heretofore been regarded as a\r\n          privilege, should more properly be considered a right--a\r\n          right to be exercised by every citizen for the public good.\r\n          If there is not another woman in Dakota who wants to vote, I\r\n          do! There is no doubt that many women are indifferent upon\r\n          this subject, but when once given the ballot you will see\r\n          that their progress will equal, if not exceed, that of the\r\n          emancipated slaves in the South. Look at Wyoming Territory,\r\n          where woman suffrage has a fair test; no one will deny it\r\n          has proved a marked success. Elections there now are quiet\r\n          and more orderly than they are elsewhere. Before the\r\n          enfranchisement of the women of Wyoming, election days were\r\n          a terror generally, being both boisterous and riotous. It is\r\n          really true that Dakota men are the most energetic and\r\n          enterprising anywhere to be found, and in number they\r\n          largely exceed our women. Gentlemen, make this the most\r\n          advantageous State for women, and they will soon be wending\r\n          their way hither. Women have been granted select committees\r\n          in both Houses of congress, and better still, each of those\r\n          committees has given us a majority report in favor of a\r\n          sixteenth amendment to the constitution of the United\r\n          States, prohibiting the disfranchisement of citizens on\r\n          account of sex. Gentlemen, delegates of this State\r\n          constitutional convention, I now appeal to your highest\r\n          sense of honor and justice to give us the right to\r\n          vote--give it to us, not because we possess any particular\r\n          merit, but give it to us because it is our right! Then\r\n          Dakota will in fact be \"a home of the free\"--honored by all\r\n          nations, and the Banner State of the Union [applause].\r\n\r\n     But, after all our work and pleading, they turned a deaf\r\n     ear--infinitely worse, they were dishonest; at least this was\r\n     true of the committee on elections. I was present at every\r\n     meeting of that committee. At their last, I was with them three\r\n     hours (the entire session) to answer objections. One member made\r\n     the motion, \"that the word 'male' be not incorporated within our\r\n     State constitution.\" The vote on the motion was a tie, when the\r\n     chairman cast his vote in the affirmative. After weeks of hard\r\n     work I had reached the goal! and with eyes brim full of tears,\r\n     thanked that committee. They then adjourned, to report in open\r\n     convention the next morning to my utter surprise, that \"Women may\r\n     vote at school elections and for school officers.\" No words of\r\n     mine can express the disappointment and humiliation this defeat\r\n     of justice caused me.\r\n\r\n     Among the hundreds of questions asked me by that committee were\r\n     these: \"Do you want a prohibitory plank in our State\r\n     constitution?\" Answer: \"No; prohibition should be settled by the\r\n     people; it cannot be with one-half our citizens disfranchised,\r\n     and that half its most earnest advocates.\" \"Do you think\r\n     prohibition prohibits?\" \"No; man's prohibitory laws are good\r\n     enough, but he does not enforce them; women have not the\r\n     authority to do so; but if you will give us the power, we will\r\n     soon have prohibition that _will_ prohibit.\" A voice: \"I believe\r\n     it!\" \"Do you think the majority of women want to vote?\" \"I do\r\n     not; but is that any reason why you should deprive the one who\r\n     does? You do not force men to vote; women, as a rule, have not\r\n     given this subject the attention they should; many of them are as\r\n     ignorant of the advantages the ballot would secure as were the\r\n     negroes when John Brown raised the insurrection at Harper's\r\n     Ferry.\"\r\n\r\n     There is a trite saying: \"The darkest hour is just before the\r\n     dawn.\" The day cannot be far distant when Dakota's women will be\r\n     free; for the most intelligent men, and those occupying the most\r\n     prominent positions in our territory, are avowed friends of\r\n     suffrage. Chief-Justice of the Supreme Court for Dakota, Hon. A.\r\n     J. Edgerton, said in his Fourth of July oration here: \"How\r\n     necessary it is for us to elect only good and honest men to\r\n     office! To do this, woman likewise must act her part in the labor\r\n     of arresting the advance of crime and corruption, although\r\n     through timidity the politician is slow to invest her with the\r\n     higher duties and obligations of American citizenship.\"\r\n\r\n     This same just judge has appointed a woman (Mrs. Washburn of\r\n     Chamberlain) stenographer of his judicial district--the best\r\n     salaried office in his gift.[454] With the assistance of this\r\n     grand man (occupying the highest position in our territory), and\r\n     many others equally efficient, it is not to be supposed that our\r\n     most intelligent women will be obliged to wait for the education\r\n     of the most ignorant men to consent to their enfranchisement.\r\n\r\n     In the last legislature (1885) Major John A. Pickler introduced a\r\n     bill enfranchising the women of the territory, which, after full\r\n     discussion, passed the House by 29 to 18,[455] and the Council by\r\n     14 to 10. The hopes of the friends were soon disappointed by the\r\n     governor's veto:\r\n\r\n                    EXECUTIVE OFFICE, BISMARK, D. T., March 13, 1885.\r\n\r\n          _To the Speaker of the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\n          I herewith return House file No. 71, with my objections to\r\n          its becoming a law. A measure of this kind demands careful\r\n          and candid consideration, both because of its importance and\r\n          because of the acknowledged sincerity and high character of\r\n          those who favor it. There are certain reasons, however, why\r\n          I cannot approve such a measure at this time, and other\r\n          reasons why I cannot approve this particular bill. It is\r\n          desirable, in my judgment, that we act, so far as possible,\r\n          as if we were governed, restrained and guided by a\r\n          constitution adopted by ourselves. If we had a constitution\r\n          modeled after those of the States, an extraordinary\r\n          proposition like this would be submitted to the people. If\r\n          congress thinks woman suffrage wise, it has the power to\r\n          establish it. It is unfair to shift the responsibility on\r\n          the territory and then hold it responsible for alleged\r\n          imprudent legislation. I am assured the enactment of this\r\n          law will delay our claims to statehood, and in so critical a\r\n          period it is better that no pretext whatever be given for\r\n          such postponement. It is doubted by many if a majority of\r\n          the women of Dakota want the franchise. The point is made,\r\n          and a very good one, that the fact that one woman does not\r\n          want a right is not a justifiable reason for refusing it to\r\n          another who does, yet it must not be forgotten that the\r\n          enfranchisement of women confers not only a privilege but a\r\n          grave burden and responsibility. We condemn the man who\r\n          neglects to vote as recreant to his duty. If women are\r\n          enfranchised, the right conferred becomes an obligation as\r\n          imperious to them as to men; on those opposed as on those\r\n          who favor the act. I think the women of Dakota should have a\r\n          voice in determining whether they should assume this burden\r\n          or not. So much for the general proposition. There are two\r\n          other features of this bill which I can scarcely think\r\n          satisfactory to the advocates of woman suffrage themselves.\r\n          I am satisfied that they should appear in a measure claiming\r\n          to advance the rights of women. If the vote of a woman is\r\n          needed anywhere, it is in our cities. In many existing city\r\n          charters a distinct clause appears, providing that males\r\n          alone shall possess the qualifications of electors. In this\r\n          bill the word \"male\" is only stricken out of one chapter of\r\n          the code, leaving the disability still standing against\r\n          hundreds of women equally entitled to recognition. The women\r\n          of Sioux Falls, the women of Mitchell, the women of\r\n          Brookings, the women of Chamberlain, of Watertown and a\r\n          great many of the more important cities in southern Dakota,\r\n          would be disqualified from voting under these special\r\n          enactments, even though this bill became a law at this very\r\n          session. Charters have been created with that provision\r\n          retained, and they would make this bill abortive and largely\r\n          inoperative. A still more objectionable feature, and one\r\n          deliberately inserted, is the clause debarring women from\r\n          the right to hold office. If the word \"male\" had been\r\n          stricken out of the code, and no other action taken, they\r\n          would have been eligible, and I believe there is a wide\r\n          feeling that many offices, particularly those connected with\r\n          penal and benevolent institutions, could be most\r\n          appropriately filled with women, but this clause practically\r\n          forbids their appointment. If women are good enough to vote\r\n          they are good enough to be voted for. If they are qualified\r\n          to choose officials, they are qualified to be chosen. I\r\n          don't say that I would approve this measure were it\r\n          otherwise worded, but I certainly would not indorse a bill\r\n          which thus keeps the word of promise to the ear and breaks\r\n          it to the hope, which deliberately and avowedly debars and\r\n          disqualifies women while assuming to exalt and honor them.\r\n          These objections are apart from the abstract right of women\r\n          to the ballot, but they show how necessary it is to approach\r\n          such a subject with deliberation. If women are to be\r\n          enfranchised, let it be done, not as a thirty days' wonder,\r\n          but as a merited reform resulting from mature reflection,\r\n          approved by the public conscience and sanctioned by the\r\n          enlightened judgment of the people.\r\n\r\n                           [Signed:]    GILBERT A. PIERCE, _Governor_.\r\n\r\n     An effort was promptly made to carry the measure over the\r\n     governor's veto, which failed by a vote of 18 to 26.\r\n\r\n     During the last session of the legislature a large public meeting\r\n     was held in Bismarck, at which many of the members spoke strongly\r\n     in favor of the woman suffrage amendment, the chief-justice and a\r\n     majority of his associates advocating the measure. Mrs. Gage, in\r\n     a letter from Dakota, said:\r\n\r\n          An acquaintance of mine, the owner of a green-house, sent\r\n          each of the members voting \"aye\" a buttonhole bouquet, a\r\n          badge of honor which marked our friends for a few hours at\r\n          least. It is a pertinent fact that, while the opposition\r\n          insist that women do not want to vote, in a single county of\r\n          this sparsely settled territory 222 women did vote in the\r\n          midst of a severe storm. In a series of articles signed\r\n          \"Justice,\" published in the Bismarck _Tribune_, we find the\r\n          following:\r\n\r\n          The women of Dakota do desire the power to vote. One year\r\n          ago a majority of the commissioners of Kingsbury county\r\n          signed a request that at an election to be held March 4,\r\n          1884, the women should, with the men, express their wishes\r\n          by vote upon a specified question of local policy. The women\r\n          immediately responded, prepared their separate ballot-boxes,\r\n          placed them in charge of the election officers by the side\r\n          of the men's boxes upon the same table at De Smet and other\r\n          towns, and voted all day side by side with the men, casting\r\n          throughout the county 222 votes. A more orderly election was\r\n          never known. No self-respect was lost and no woman was\r\n          lowered in public esteem. Clergymen, lawyers, merchants,\r\n          farmers, all voted with their wives, the ballots going into\r\n          different boxes. One thousand men voted in the county. The\r\n          day was stormy and snow deep on the ground. If 222 women in\r\n          one county would without previous experience spring forward\r\n          to vote on a week's notice, is it to be supposed they do not\r\n          appreciate the right?\r\n\r\n                                                       JUSTICE.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Pickler, who had taken an active part in the discussion on\r\n     the amendment, received many letters of thanks from the friends\r\n     of woman suffrage throughout the nation, and made his\r\n     acknowledgments in the following cordial letter to Mrs. Matilda\r\n     Joslyn Gage:\r\n\r\n                                   FAULKTON, D. T., April 20, 1885.\r\n\r\n          _Matilda Joslyn Gage, Syracuse, N. Y._:\r\n\r\n          DEAR MADAM: Your kind letter addressed to me on the Woman\r\n          Suffrage bill, at Bismarck, would have been earlier\r\n          acknowledged had it not been that I suffered quite a severe\r\n          illness upon my return from the legislature. I beg to assure\r\n          you that words of encouragement from such able and\r\n          distinguished personages as yourself have been highly\r\n          appreciated in my effort to secure suffrage for women in\r\n          Dakota. I am half inclined to think that your indication as\r\n          to a coming political party, with woman suffrage as one\r\n          plank in its platform, may not be without foundation.\r\n\r\n          I introduced the bill in the Dakota legislature, having\r\n          previously supported a like measure in the Iowa legislature,\r\n          really without consultation with any one, or without\r\n          knowledge as to the sentiment of the members upon the\r\n          question. I have had my convictions since my college days\r\n          that simple justice demands that woman should have the\r\n          ballot, and in this opinion I am warmly seconded by my wife,\r\n          who desires to vote, as I think all sensible women should. I\r\n          was pleased with the favor the bill received, and after a\r\n          week or two believed it possible to have it pass the House,\r\n          with constant exertion and watchfulness. Those who at first\r\n          laughed at the idea, learning I was very much in earnest,\r\n          stopped to consider and to discuss, and finally came to vote\r\n          for it.\r\n\r\n          It passed the House, and after considerable difficulty in\r\n          getting it out of the hands of an adverse committee in the\r\n          Council, who insisted on having it referred to them, it\r\n          passed with an amendment \"to submit to a vote of the\r\n          people.\" I managed to have the House refuse to concur in\r\n          this amendment, which resulted in a conference committee,\r\n          five out of six of whom reported in favor of the Council\r\n          receding from their amendment, which they did, and yet,\r\n          after all, and when we thought it safe, it was vetoed. Few,\r\n          if any, supposed that Governor Pierce, a governor only\r\n          appointed over us less than six months, would place himself\r\n          a barrier in the way of the will of the people, and opposed\r\n          to the advancement of human rights. I deeply regret that he\r\n          did not rise to the grandest opportunity of his life, but he\r\n          failed to do so.\r\n\r\n          Your words were particularly encouraging, being personally\r\n          interested in Dakota as you are, and I dare say you will\r\n          bear witness that we have an intelligent people, and a great\r\n          many good women, land-owners and property-holders, who\r\n          should have a voice in the taxation of their property, real\r\n          and personal. We shall not give it up; we shall continue in\r\n          the work, not doubting that success will finally crown our\r\n          efforts. Our constitution is not yet formed, and if ever the\r\n          political parties cease to exercise their tyranny over us,\r\n          by allowing us to be admitted as a State, we shall endeavor\r\n          at least to secure it so the legislature may grant or\r\n          prescribe the qualifications of voters without requiring a\r\n          change in the constitution.\r\n\r\n          Will you visit Dakota again? In another contest we would be\r\n          much aided by your presence and assistance, confidently\r\n          believing that \"Heaven will one day free us from this\r\n          slavery.\" If your children[456] reside in this section of\r\n          the territory, I should be pleased to form their\r\n          acquaintance. Again thanking you for your kind words, I am,\r\n\r\n                                   Yours truly, J. A. PICKLER.\r\n\r\nAs Dakota has thus deliberately trampled upon the rights of\r\none-half her people, it is to be hoped that congress will not admit\r\nher into the Union until that odious word \"male\" is stricken from\r\nher constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[453] These counties are Union, Lincoln, Clay, Minnehaha, Moody,\r\nDeuel, Codington, Cass, Walsh, Grand Forks, Pembina, Barnes,\r\nLawrence and Hutchinson.\r\n\r\n[454] Since 1882 Mrs. Bones has held the office of deputy-clerk of\r\nthe District Court of Day county; Mrs. Washburn was appointed to\r\nher office in 1884; Miss Elizabeth M.

In her\r\ncountry home, as one of a large family, she had but scant\r\nopportunities for attending the district school, but her father\r\nencouraged and assisted his children to study in the winter\r\nevenings, and in this way she fitted herself to teach in country\r\nschools. After a few terms she entered, the State University at\r\nMadison, and while there made a constant effort to secure equal\r\nprivileges and opportunities for the students of her sex. She was\r\ngraduated with honors in 1869, and at once became a teacher of\r\nhistory and Latin in the institution. She was married to Leonard W.\r\nColby, a graduate of the same university, and moved to Beatrice,\r\nNebraska, in 1872. Amidst the hardships of pioneer life in a new\r\ncountry, the young wife for a season found her family cares\r\nall-absorbing, but her taste for study, her love of literature and\r\nher natural desire to improve the conditions about her, soon led\r\nher to work up an interest in the establishment of a library and\r\ncourse of lectures. She afterwards edited a department in the\r\nBeatrice _Express_ called \"Woman's Work,\" and in 1883 she started\r\n_The Woman's Tribune_, a paper whose columns show that Mrs. Colby\r\nhas the true editorial instinct. For several years she has been\r\ndeeply interested in the movement for woman's enfranchisement,\r\ndevoting her journal to the advocacy of this great reform. In\r\naddition to her cares as housekeeper[457] and editor, Mrs. Colby\r\nhas also lectured extensively in many States, east and west, not\r\nonly to popular audiences, but before legislative and congressional\r\ncommittees.\r\n\r\nIn her description of Nebraska and the steps of progress in woman's\r\ncivil and political rights, Mrs. Colby says:\r\n\r\n     Nebraska makes its first appearance in history as part of\r\n     Louisiana and belonging to Spain. Seized by France in 1683, ceded\r\n     to Spain in 1762; again the property of France in 1800, and sold\r\n     to the United States in 1803; the shifting ownership yet left no\r\n     trace on that interior and inaccessible portion of Louisiana now\r\n     known as Nebraska. It was the home of the Dakotas, who had come\r\n     down from the north pushing the earlier Indian races before them.\r\n     Every autumn when _Heyokah_, the Spirit of the North, puffed from\r\n     his huge pipe the purpling smoke \"enwrapping all the land in\r\n     mellow haze,\" the Dakotas gathered at the Great Red Pipestone\r\n     Quarry for their annual feast and council. These yearly\r\n     excursions brought them in contact with the fur traders, who in\r\n     turn roamed the wild and beautiful country of the Niobrara,\r\n     returning thence to Quebec laden with pelts. With the exception\r\n     of a few military posts, the first established in 1820 where the\r\n     town of Fort Calhoun now stands, Nebraska was uninhabited by\r\n     white people until the gold hunters of 1849 passed through what\r\n     seemed to them an arid desert, as they sought their Eldorado in\r\n     the mountains beyond. Disappointed and homesick, many of the\r\n     emigrants retraced their steps, and found their former trail\r\n     through Nebraska marked by sunflowers, the luxuriance of which\r\n     evidenced the fertility of the soil, and encouraged the travelers\r\n     to settle within its borders.\r\n\r\n     Nebraska became an organized territory by the Kansas-Nebraska\r\n     bill in 1854, including at first Dakota, Idaho and Colorado, from\r\n     which it was separated in 1863. The early settlers were\r\n     courageous, keeping heart amid attacks of savages, and\r\n     devastations of the fire-demon and the locust. Published history\r\n     is silent concerning the part that women took in this frontier\r\n     life, but the tales told by the fireside are full of the\r\n     endurance and heroism of wives whose very isolation kept them\r\n     hand to hand, shoulder to shoulder, and thought to thought with\r\n     their husbands. It is not strange then that the men of those\r\n     early days inclined readily to the idea of sharing the rights of\r\n     self-government with women who had with them left home and\r\n     kindred and the comforts of the older States. But it is\r\n     remarkable, and proof that the thought belongs to the age, that,\r\n     thirty years ago, when the discussion of woman's status was still\r\n     new in Massachusetts and New York, and only seven years after the\r\n     first woman-suffrage convention ever held, here--half way across\r\n     a continent, in a country almost unheard of, and with but scant\r\n     communication with the older parts of the Republic--this\r\n     instinctive justice should have crystalized into legislative\r\n     action.\r\n\r\n     In December, 1855, an invitation was extended by the territorial\r\n     legislature to Mrs. Amelia Bloomer of Council Bluffs, to deliver\r\n     an address on woman's rights, in the Hall of the House of\r\n     Representatives. This invitation was signed by twenty-five\r\n     members of the legislature and was accepted by Mrs. Bloomer for\r\n     January 8. The following pleasing account of this address and its\r\n     reception was written by an Omaha correspondent of the Council\r\n     Bluffs _Chronotype_ of that date:\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Amelia Bloomer, who had been formally invited by\r\n          members of the legislature and others, arrived at the door\r\n          of the state-house at 7 o'clock, P. M., and by the gallantry\r\n          of Gen. Larimer, a passage was made for her to the platform.\r\n          The house had been crowded for some time with eager\r\n          expectants to see the lady and listen to the arguments which\r\n          were to be adduced as the fruitage of female thought and\r\n          research. When all had been packed into the house who could\r\n          possibly find a place for the sole of the foot, Mrs. Bloomer\r\n          arose, amid cheers. We watched her closely, and saw that she\r\n          was perfectly self-possessed--not a nerve seemed to be moved\r\n          by excitement, and the voice did not tremble. She arose in\r\n          the dignity of a true woman, as if the importance of her\r\n          mission so absorbed her thoughts that timidity or\r\n          bashfulness were too mean to entangle the mental powers. She\r\n          delivered her lecture in a pleasing, able, and I may say,\r\n          eloquent manner that enchained the attention of her audience\r\n          for an hour and a half. A _man_ could not have beaten it.\r\n\r\n          In mingling with the people next day, we found that her\r\n          argument had met with much favor. As far as property rights\r\n          are concerned, all seemed to agree with the lady that the\r\n          laws of our country are wrong, and that woman should receive\r\n          the same protection as man. All we have time to say now is,\r\n          that Mrs. Bloomer's arguments on woman's rights are\r\n          unanswerable. We may doubt it is policy for women to vote,\r\n          but who can draw the line and say that naturally she has not\r\n          a right to do so? Mrs. Bloomer, though a little body, is\r\n          among the great women of the United States; and her keen,\r\n          intellectual eye seems to flash fire from a fountain that\r\n          will consume the stubble of old theories until woman is\r\n          placed in her true position in the enjoyment of equal rights\r\n          and privileges. Her only danger is in asking too much.\r\n\r\n                                                            ONEIDA.\r\n\r\n     Eight days after Mrs. Bloomer's address, Hon. Jerome Hoover,\r\n     member for the counties of Nemaha and Richardson, introduced in\r\n     the House a bill to confer suffrage equally upon women. The bill\r\n     was put upon its third reading, January 25, and was earnestly\r\n     championed by General William Larimer of Douglas county, formerly\r\n     of Pittsburgh, Pa. It passed by a vote of 14 to 11.[458] The\r\n     result of the passage of the bill by the House was graphically\r\n     described by the _Chronotype_ of January 30:\r\n\r\n          On Friday afternoon and evening quite an excitement took\r\n          place, which resulted in offering an insult to one of the\r\n          ablest members of the legislature, but which, while it\r\n          reflected no dishonor upon the person against whom it was\r\n          aimed, should cover the perpetrators with lasting shame. We\r\n          will state briefly the facts as we have heard them.\r\n\r\n          The bill giving woman the right to vote came up at 11\r\n          o'clock, by a special order of the House. A number of ladies\r\n          entered the hall to listen to the proceedings. General\r\n          Larimer spoke eloquently and ably in favor of the bill,\r\n          making, perhaps, the best speech that could be made on that\r\n          side of the question. On the vote being taken, it\r\n          stood--ayes 14, nays 11. The bill was then sent to the\r\n          Council, where it was referred to the Committee on\r\n          Elections. Its passage by the House of Representatives\r\n          created a great deal of talk, and several members threatened\r\n          to resign. At the evening session J. S. Morton, W. E. Moore,\r\n          A. F. Salisbury and L. L. Bowen came into the House and\r\n          proposed to present General Larimer with a petticoat, which\r\n          did not tend much to allay the excitement. The General, of\r\n          course, was justly indignant at such treatment, as were also\r\n          the other members. The proposal was characteristic of the\r\n          prime mover in it, and we are astonished that the other\r\n          gentlemen named should have been willing to associate\r\n          themselves with him in offering this indignity to the oldest\r\n          and most respected member of the body--a man who was elected\r\n          to the station he has so ably filled by the unanimous vote\r\n          of the people of Douglas county. General Larimer had a\r\n          perfect right to advocate or oppose the bill according to\r\n          his own sense of duty, and any man, or set of men, who would\r\n          attempt to cast insult or ridicule upon him for so doing, is\r\n          worthy only of the contempt of decent people. In saying this\r\n          we, of course, express no opinion on the merits of the bill\r\n          itself.\r\n\r\n     The bill was taken up in the Council, read twice, and referred to\r\n     the Committee on Elections, whose chairman, Mr. Cowles, reported\r\n     it back without amendment, and recommended its passage. This\r\n     being the last day of the session, the bill could not come up\r\n     again. The _Chronotype_, after the adjournment, commented as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n          The bill granting women the right to vote, which had passed\r\n          the House, was read the first and second time in the Council\r\n          and referred to the Committee on Elections, where it now\r\n          remains for want of time to bring it up again. A gentleman\r\n          who was opposed to the passage of a bill to locate the seat\r\n          of justice of Washington county, obtained the floor, and\r\n          delivered a speech of many hours on some unimportant bill\r\n          then under consideration, in order to \"kill time\" and\r\n          prevent the Washington county bill from coming up. The hour\r\n          for adjournment _sine die_ arrived before he concluded, and\r\n          the Woman Suffrage bill, and many others of great\r\n          importance, remained upon the clerk's table without being\r\n          acted upon. It is admitted by every one that want of time\r\n          only defeated the passage of the bill through the Council.\r\n          The citizens of Nebraska are ready to make a trial of its\r\n          provisions, which speaks volumes for the intelligence of the\r\n          free and independent squatters of this beautiful territory.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Bloomer says that assurance was given by members of the\r\n     Council that the bill would have passed that body triumphantly\r\n     had more time been allowed, or had it been introduced earlier in\r\n     the session. The general sentiment was in favor of it, and the\r\n     gentlemen who talked the last hours away to kill other bills were\r\n     alone responsible for its defeat. Mrs. Bloomer followed up her\r\n     work by lectures in Omaha and Nebraska City two years later.\r\n\r\n     The exigencies attending the settlement of the territory and the\r\n     absorbing interests of the civil war occupied the next decade.\r\n     The character of the settlers may be inferred from the fact that,\r\n     with only about 5,000 voters, Nebraska gave over 3,000 soldiers\r\n     for the defense of the Union and of their home borders, where the\r\n     Indians had seized the occasion to break out into active\r\n     hostilities. The war over, Nebraska sought to be admitted as a\r\n     State, and a constitution was prepared on the old basis of white\r\n     male suffrage. Congress admitted Nebraska, but provided that the\r\n     act should not take effect until the constitution should be\r\n     changed to harmonize with the fourteenth amendment. After some\r\n     discussion the condition was accepted, and Nebraska was thus the\r\n     first State to recognize in its constitution the sovereignty of\r\n     all male persons. Some of the debates of this time indicate that\r\n     the appreciation of human rights was growing, nor were allusions\r\n     wanting making a direct application of the principle to women.\r\n     The debates and resolutions connected with the ratification of\r\n     the fourteenth amendment are historically and logically connected\r\n     with the growth of the idea of woman's political equality. The\r\n     man who, from regard for justice and civil liberties, advocates\r\n     the right of franchise for additional classes of men, easily\r\n     extends the thought until it embraces woman. On the other hand\r\n     the man who sees men enfranchised whom he deems unworthy to use\r\n     the ballot, thinks it a disgrace to withhold it from intelligent\r\n     women. Gov. Alvin Saunders,[459] in his message urging the\r\n     ratification of the fourteenth amendment said:\r\n\r\n          The day, in my opinion, is not far distant when property\r\n          qualifications, educational qualifications, and color\r\n          qualifications, as precedent to the privilege of voting,\r\n          will be known no more by the American people, but that\r\n          intelligence and manhood will be the only qualifications\r\n          necessary to entitle an American citizen to the privilege of\r\n          an elector.\r\n\r\n     Later, Acting-governor A. S. Paddock[459] in his message said:\r\n\r\n          I should hail with joy a radical change in the rule of\r\n          suffrage which would give the franchise to intelligence and\r\n          patriotism wherever found, regardless of the color of the\r\n          possessor.\r\n\r\n     The majority report of the committee to whom was referred that\r\n     portion of the governor's message which related to rights of\r\n     suffrage, was as follows:\r\n\r\n          We hold that the dogma of partial suffrage is a dangerous\r\n          doctrine, and contrary to the laws of nature and the letter\r\n          and spirit of the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\n               [Signed:]     ISAAC WILES, WILLIAM DAILEY, GEORGE CROW.\r\n\r\n          A minority report was brought in by S. M. Curran and Aug. F.\r\n          Harvey. On its rejection Mr. Harvey introduced this\r\n          resolution:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That we, the members of the House of\r\n          Representatives, of the legislature of Nebraska, are in\r\n          favor of impartial and universal suffrage, and believe fully\r\n          in the equality of all races, colors and sexes at the\r\n          ballot-box.\r\n\r\n     This was not intended to advance the rights of women, but simply\r\n     to slay the advocates of the enlargement of the franchise with\r\n     their own weapons. A. B. Fuller moved to amend by striking out\r\n     the word \"universal,\" and all after the word \"suffrage,\" which\r\n     was carried by a vote of 22 to 9. The Committee on Federal\r\n     Relations reported:\r\n\r\n          The constitution recognizes all persons born within the\r\n          United States, or naturalized in pursuance of the law, to be\r\n          citizens, and entitled to the rights of citizenship; and a\r\n          recent act of congress amends the organization acts of the\r\n          several territories so as to confer the rights of suffrage\r\n          upon all citizens except such as are disqualified by reason\r\n          of crime. Consequently, when congress decrees that we shall\r\n          not, as a State, deprive citizens of rights already\r\n          guaranteed to them, it does not transcend its powers, or\r\n          impose upon us conditions from which we are now exempt.\r\n\r\n     With these discussions of fundamental principles which, although\r\n     couched in the most comprehensive terms, strangely enough\r\n     conserved the rights of only half the citizens, the fourteenth\r\n     amendment was ratified, and Nebraska became a State on March 1,\r\n     1867.\r\n\r\n     The early legislation of Nebraska was favorable to woman, and\r\n     much ahead of that passed in the same period by most of the older\r\n     States, The records show that a few legislators treated any\r\n     matter that referred to the rights of woman as a jest, but the\r\n     majority were liberal or respectful, and the honored names of\r\n     Dailey, Reavis, Majors, Porter, Kelley, and others, constantly\r\n     recur in the records of the earlier sessions as pushing favorable\r\n     legislation for women. At almost every session, too, the actual\r\n     question of the ballot for woman was broached. The legislature of\r\n     1869 bestowed school suffrage on women;[460] and a joint\r\n     resolution and a memorial to congress relative to female suffrage\r\n     were introduced. The journals show that:\r\n\r\n          Hon. Isham Reavis of Falls City, introduced in the Senate\r\n          January 30, a memorial and joint resolution to congress, on\r\n          the subject of female suffrage. After the second reading, on\r\n          motion of Mr. Majors, it was referred to a select committee\r\n          of bachelors, consisting of Senators Gere, Majors, Porter,\r\n          and Goodwill, who reported it back without recommendation.\r\n          It was afterwards considered in committee of the whole, then\r\n          taken up by the Senate. Reavis moved it be taken up for\r\n          third reading on the following day. The yeas and nays being\r\n          demanded the motion was lost by a vote of 6 to 7. On motion\r\n          of Mr. Stevenson the matter was referred to the Judiciary\r\n          Committee, with the usual result of neglect and oblivion.\r\n\r\n     In the autumn of 1867 Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony lectured in\r\n     Omaha and sowed seed which bore fruit in the large number of\r\n     petitions sent later from that city. In December 1870, Mrs. Tracy\r\n     Cutler gave several addresses in Lincoln. Miss Anthony lectured\r\n     January 28, 1871, on \"The False Theory,\" and before leaving the\r\n     city looked in on the legislature, which promptly extended to her\r\n     the privilege of the floor. A number of ladies met Miss Anthony\r\n     for consultation, and took the initiatory steps for forming a\r\n     State association. A meeting was appointed for the following\r\n     Friday, when it was decided to memorialize the legislature. The\r\n     memorial was headed by Mrs. Lydia Butler, wife of the governor of\r\n     the State, who spent some days in securing signatures. A lively\r\n     pen-picture of those times is furnished by private correspondence\r\n     of Mrs. Esther L. Warner of Roca:\r\n\r\n          The first work done for woman suffrage in Lincoln was in\r\n          December, 1870. Mrs. Tracy Cutler stopped when on her way to\r\n          California, and gave several addresses in Lincoln. Her\r\n          womanliness and logic won and convinced her hearers, and had\r\n          a marked effect upon public sentiment. There are men and\r\n          women to-day in Nebraska who date their conversion to the\r\n          cause of equal rights from those lectures. Some steps were\r\n          taken towards organization, but the matter was dropped in\r\n          its incipient stages. During the same winter Miss Susan B.\r\n          Anthony lectured in Lincoln, and presented a petition to be\r\n          signed by women, asking to be allowed to vote under the\r\n          fourteenth amendment. She also called a meeting of ladies in\r\n          a hotel parlor and aided in organizing a State suffrage\r\n          society. Her rare executive ability accomplished what other\r\n          hands would have failed to do, for the difficulties in the\r\n          way of such a movement at that early day were great. Lydia\r\n          Butler, wife of Governor Butler, was elected president, and\r\n          other representative women filled the various offices, but\r\n          after a short time it was deemed wise to disband, as\r\n          circumstances made it impossible to keep up an efficient\r\n          organization. Time and money were not plentiful with western\r\n          women, but we did what we could, and sent a petition to the\r\n          legislature that winter asking a resolution recommending to\r\n          the coming State convention to omit the word \"male\" from the\r\n          constitution. The petition was signed by about 1,000 women,\r\n          and received respectful attention from the legislature, and\r\n          speeches were made in its favor by several members. Among\r\n          others the speaker of the House, F. M. McDougal, favored the\r\n          resolution. Governor Butler sent a special message with the\r\n          petition, recommending the passage of the resolution, for\r\n          which Nebraska women will always honor him.\r\n\r\n          Next it was thought best to call a convention in the\r\n          interest of woman suffrage, to be held while the\r\n          constitutional convention should be in session the coming\r\n          summer. Two women were commissioned to prepare the call and\r\n          present it for the signatures of members of the legislature\r\n          who favored the measure. It was thought this course would\r\n          give dignity and importance to the call which would secure\r\n          attention throughout the State. The session of the\r\n          legislature was very exciting. Intrigue accomplished the\r\n          impeachment of a high State official, and others were being\r\n          dragged down. As it neared its close the political cauldron\r\n          boiled and bubbled with redoubled violence. It was more than\r\n          any woman dared do to approach it. Were not the political\r\n          fortunes and the sacred honor (?) of men in jeopardy?\r\n          Woman's rights sunk into insignificance. We subsided. Our\r\n          hour had not yet come.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Butler says of the part she took at this time: \"I\r\n     entertained the speakers because requested to, and found them so\r\n     pleasant and persuasive that I soon became a convert to their\r\n     views. The active and intelligent leaders at that time were\r\n     Mesdames Cropsey, Galey, Warner, Monell, Coda, and many others\r\n     whose names I cannot recall.\" As the result of the effort thus\r\n     made the legislature of 1871 memorialized the constitutional\r\n     convention relative to submitting the question to the electors.\r\n     The proceedings given in the journals are as follows:\r\n\r\n          February 4, 1871, Mr. J. C. Myers announced that ladies were\r\n          in the gallery, and desired to present a petition. A\r\n          committee was appointed to wait on them. D. J. Quimby\r\n          introduced a resolution asking an opinion of the\r\n          attorney-general as to whether in accepting the fourteenth\r\n          and fifteenth amendments we grant the right of suffrage to\r\n          women. It was carried, and the memorial, the opinion, and\r\n          the governor's message were referred to the judiciary\r\n          committee, which reported through Mr. Galey as follows:\r\n\r\n          _Whereas_, The constitution of the State of Nebraska\r\n          prohibits the women of said State from exercising the right\r\n          of the elective franchise; and\r\n\r\n          _Whereas_, Taxation without representation is repugnant to a\r\n          republican form of government, and applies to women as well\r\n          as all other citizens of this State; and\r\n\r\n          _Whereas_, All laws which make any distinction between the\r\n          political rights and privileges of males and females are\r\n          unbecoming to the people of this State in the year 1871 of\r\n          the world's progress, and tend only to deprive the latter of\r\n          the means necessary for their own protection in the various\r\n          pursuits and callings of life. Therefore be it\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, By the House of Representatives of the State of\r\n          Nebraska, that the constitutional convention to be begun and\r\n          holden on the--day of May, 1871, for the purpose of\r\n          revising and amending the constitution of said State, is\r\n          hereby most respectfully and earnestly requested to draft\r\n          such amendment to the constitution of this State as will\r\n          allow the women thereof to exercise the right of the\r\n          elective franchise and afford to them such other and further\r\n          relief as to that honorable body may be deemed wise,\r\n          expedient and proper; and be it further\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That said convention is hereby most respectfully\r\n          and earnestly requested to make such provision (when said\r\n          amendment shall be submitted to a vote of the people of said\r\n          State) as will enable the women of Nebraska to vote at said\r\n          election for the adoption or rejection of the same.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, Further, that the Secretary of State is hereby\r\n          instructed to present a copy of this resolution to said\r\n          convention as soon as the same shall be convened.\r\n\r\n          Mr. Porter moved the adoption of the report, which was\r\n          carried by a vote of 19 to 16.[461] In the Senate, March 22,\r\n          E. C. Cunningham offered the following amendment to the bill\r\n          providing for calling a constitutional convention:\r\n\r\n          That the electors of the State be and are hereby authorized\r\n          and recommended to vote for and against female suffrage at\r\n          the election for members of the constitutional convention.\r\n          Provided, That at such election all women above the age of\r\n          21 years, possessing the qualifications required of male\r\n          electors are hereby authorized and requested to vote upon\r\n          said proposition, and for the purpose of receiving their\r\n          votes a separate polling place shall be provided.\r\n\r\n          The amendment was lost by a vote of 6 to 6.[462]\r\n\r\n     In accordance with the memorial of the legislature, the\r\n     constitutional convention that met in the following summer by a\r\n     vote of 30 to 13[463] submitted a clause relative to the right of\r\n     suffrage. The constitution itself was rejected by the voters; and\r\n     on this clause the ballot stood, for, 3,502; against, 12,676. Had\r\n     it been carried at the polls, it would only have conferred upon\r\n     the legislature the right to submit amendments, and it was\r\n     therefore no special object to the adherents of impartial\r\n     suffrage to make efforts for its adoption, while the fact that it\r\n     was the outgrowth of the discussion of that principle brought\r\n     upon it all the opposition that a clause actually conferring the\r\n     ballot would have insured. The right of woman to the elective\r\n     franchise was championed by the ablest men in the convention.\r\n     Night after night the question was argued _pro_ and _con_.\r\n     Petitions from Lincoln and Omaha were numerously presented. The\r\n     galleries were filled with women eagerly watching the result. The\r\n     proposition finally adopted did not touch the point at issue, but\r\n     was accepted as all that could be obtained on that occasion. As\r\n     the constitution was not adopted, the succeeding legislature felt\r\n     no interest in the proceedings of the convention, and the\r\n     journals were not printed; and the records of this battle for\r\n     justice and civil liberty were hidden in the dusty archives of\r\n     the state-house until brought out to tell their story for these\r\n     pages. As this is the only discussion of the question by Nebraska\r\n     statesmen which has been officially preserved, and as the\r\n     debaters were among the most prominent men of the State, and\r\n     many of them retain that position to-day, a few extracts will be\r\n     of interest:\r\n\r\n          The discussion began with the motion of Mr. I. S. Hascall to\r\n          strike out \"men\" and insert \"persons\" in the clause \"All men\r\n          are by nature free and independent.\" The motion was lost.\r\n          General E. Estabrook moved to add \"Every human being of full\r\n          age, and resident for a proper length of time on the soil of\r\n          the Nation and State, who is required to obey the law, is\r\n          entitled to a voice in its enactment; and every such person\r\n          whose property is taxed for the support of the government is\r\n          entitled to a direct representation in such government.\" Mr.\r\n          Hascall moved that \"man\" be inserted in place of \"human\r\n          being.\" Mr. E. S. Towle desired to put \"male\" in the place\r\n          of \"man.\" General Estabrook, on being asked if his amendment\r\n          was intended to cover \"woman's rights,\" replied:\r\n\r\n          I take pleasure in making the amendment because it is a step\r\n          in the right direction. Justice to woman is the keystone in\r\n          the arch of the temple of liberty we are now building. That\r\n          no citizen should be taxed without representation is an\r\n          underlying principle of a republic and no free government\r\n          can exist without it.\r\n\r\n          General Estabrook seems to have stood alone in considering\r\n          that the principle of impartial suffrage properly belonged\r\n          to the Bill of Rights. The amendments were lost. When the\r\n          article on extension of suffrage was under discussion,\r\n          General Estabrook opened the subject in a comprehensive\r\n          speech, lasting all one evening and part of the next. He\r\n          proved that women were citizens, citing the petitions to\r\n          congress relative to woman's right to vote under the\r\n          fourteenth and fifteenth amendments, and the reports of the\r\n          committee thereupon--one in favor and one opposed, but both\r\n          agreeing that women are citizens. Then he showed what rights\r\n          they were entitled to as citizens, quoting the Federal\r\n          Constitution, Bouvier's Institutes and Law Dictionary, James\r\n          Madison, Paine's Dissertation on the Principles of\r\n          Government, Otis' Rights of the Colonies, Thomas Jefferson,\r\n          Benjamin Franklin, and others. Commenting upon these, he set\r\n          forth that women vote in corporations, administer estates,\r\n          manage hospitals and rule empires without harm to themselves\r\n          and with benefit to everybody else. He made a special\r\n          argument to the Democrats, reviewing the position of some of\r\n          their leading men, and closed with saying, \"This is the most\r\n          important measure yet considered, because it contains a\r\n          fundamental principle.\"\r\n\r\n          General Strickland then introduced a resolution that an\r\n          article for woman suffrage should be submitted to the\r\n          people, that the women should vote separately, and that if a\r\n          majority of both men and women should be in favor, it should\r\n          become a law. The member did not move this because he\r\n          favored the principle, but because he felt sure the women\r\n          would not vote for it. He could not understand what a woman\r\n          could possibly want more than she had, having the privileges\r\n          while man has the drudgery. He closed with the prophecy that\r\n          in two years not a woman would vote in Wyoming.\r\n\r\n          General Charles F. Manderson followed. Taking the ground\r\n          that the members were not in convention to look after the\r\n          rights of the males only, he said: \"Did we recognize the\r\n          right of all the people to be represented, we should have\r\n          to-day on this floor some persons sent here to represent the\r\n          women of our State. Men do not represent women because they\r\n          are not and cannot be held responsible by them. We have no\r\n          more right to represent the women here than a man in Iowa\r\n          has to go to congress and presume to represent Nebraska\r\n          there.\" To illustrate the principle General Manderson\r\n          instanced that in the New York Constitutional Conventions of\r\n          1801 and 1821, persons voted for delegates who had not the\r\n          property qualifications to vote at ordinary elections. Even\r\n          the black man was represented by delegates for whom he had\r\n          voted. In presenting a petition from Lincoln with seventy\r\n          names of women who desired to vote, General Manderson said\r\n          he had made inquiries, and these were the names of the\r\n          respectable, influential ladies of Lincoln, sixty-three of\r\n          whom were married. He then reviewed the history and workings\r\n          of woman suffrage in Wyoming, furnishing the highest\r\n          testimony in its favor, and closed as follows:\r\n\r\n          Mr. Chairman, I envy not the heart or the head of the man,\r\n          let him occupy what place he may, let him sit in a\r\n          legislative body or wield the editorial pen, who is so base\r\n          as to denounce the advocates of this measure as demagogues,\r\n          and to say that if the right is extended to woman, the low,\r\n          the miserable, will outnumber at the polls the thousands of\r\n          virtuous wives throughout this land who advocate this\r\n          measure; the lie is thrown in his teeth by that noble woman,\r\n          Mrs. Livermore, who did more service in time of war as a\r\n          soldier battling for the right than did even my gallant\r\n          friend, and did far more than myself. She inaugurated and\r\n          carried in her mighty hand and guided by her mighty brain\r\n          that Western Ladies' Aid Society, and helped by some means\r\n          the Western Sanitary Association that did more than 10,000\r\n          armed men to suppress the late rebellion. The lie is hurled\r\n          in the teeth of the vile slanderer by this petition from the\r\n          honest, virtuous ladies of the city of Lincoln. If we have\r\n          planted one seed, that will bring forth good fruit, God be\r\n          thanked for that result.\r\n\r\n          Mr. Kenaston spoke in favor of the measure, and Judge Moore\r\n          opposed it in a very witty speech, of which the principal\r\n          points were that the members were to decide according to\r\n          expediency, not right; that women had always consented to\r\n          the government--never trampled the flag in the dust, but\r\n          always rallied to its support. Judge O. P. Mason followed in\r\n          opposition, also J. C. Myers, the latter claiming that for\r\n          twenty years the advocates of woman suffrage have made\r\n          little, if any, impression on the public mind. E. F. Gray\r\n          had begun speaking in favor when Victor Vifquain moved the\r\n          previous question. A lively debate followed this, but it did\r\n          not prevail. Mr. Mason said: \"If we hold the right on this\r\n          question let us challenge discussion and meet the\r\n          opposition. It is not a wasted time that sows the seed of\r\n          truth in the brain.\" Mr. Manderson urged the number of\r\n          petitions that had been sent in as a reason for full\r\n          discussion. R. F. Stevenson said he was opposed to it in\r\n          every form. A. L. Sprague was against submitting this\r\n          question at any time, that neither by the laws of God nor of\r\n          man were women entitled to vote. Seth Robinson would like to\r\n          hear the social aspects of the question discussed. He said:\r\n          \"I would like, gentlemen, to show whether it would not have\r\n          a tendency to regenerate our social system and make women as\r\n          a class more efficient than they are.\" The motion for the\r\n          previous question being lost a motion was made to strike out\r\n          this section. While this was pending General Estabrook\r\n          insisted that it should be re-committed, saying: \"It is the\r\n          only political question that has essential principle in it.\r\n          There are not brains enough in this convention to show the\r\n          justice of taxation without representation. Judge George B.\r\n          Lake warmly seconded Mr. Estabrook's motion. O. P. Mason\r\n          wanted the proposition to be submitted to both sexes\r\n          separately. J. E. Philpott advocated woman suffrage in a\r\n          comprehensive argument. In closing, he said:\r\n\r\n          I demand that suffrage shall be extended to females for the\r\n          reason that they have not adequate representation in the\r\n          electoral department. As evidence of this I cite the\r\n          undeniable facts that in this State woman has not fair wages\r\n          for her work--has not a fair field to work in. The law, with\r\n          all its freedom, does not place her on the same footing as\r\n          to property that it does males. She has no voice as an\r\n          elector in the making of the laws which regulate her marital\r\n          union, no voice in the laws which sever those ties. The\r\n          motto of the State is \"Equality Before the Law.\" This can no\r\n          more be among us with women disfranchised than in our nation\r\n          all men could be free and equal while there were more than\r\n          3,000,000 slaves.\r\n\r\n          A. J. Weaver spoke in opposition and was followed by Hon. I.\r\n          S. Hascall, who based his advocacy of the principle on the\r\n          rights that woman has as an individual:\r\n\r\n          Because we have started upon the wrong track, because women\r\n          in the dark ages were in bondage, is no reason, when we have\r\n          advanced to a higher civilization, that we should continue\r\n          this barbarous practice. There is a higher point to reach\r\n          and I want to see the people reach that point. I think that\r\n          the American people are old enough in experience to bring\r\n          order out of disorder, and that when the question arises\r\n          they will meet it in such a way as will be satisfactory to\r\n          all.\r\n\r\n          Mr. Stevenson spoke in opposition basing his argument on\r\n          man's superiority to woman and closed with this remarkable\r\n          prediction which has probably never been surpassed as a\r\n          specimen of \"spread eagle\":\r\n\r\n          Finally, Mr. President, I really think that if the ballot\r\n          were placed in the hands of woman the old American eagle\r\n          that stands with one foot upon the Alleghanies and the other\r\n          upon the Rockies, whetting his beak upon the ice-capped\r\n          mountains of Alaska, and covering half the Southern gulf\r\n          with his tail, will cease to scream and sink into the pits\r\n          of blackness of darkness amidst the shrieks of lost spirits\r\n          that will forever echo and reecho through cavernous depths\r\n          unknown.\r\n\r\n          S. P. Majors advocated the measure, and in the course of the\r\n          discussion, B. I. Hinman offered a burlesque resolution,\r\n          proposing to change the duties and functions of the sexes by\r\n          law, and John D. Neligh said:\r\n\r\n          The gentleman from Otoe (Mr. Mason) will get the commission\r\n          of the Christian mothers, not _against_ the right of female\r\n          suffrage, but _for_ universal suffrage. That will be a happy\r\n          day--a day when we shall shine out as a nation more brightly\r\n          than any other nation under the sun.[464]\r\n\r\n     The constitution of 1871 not having been adopted, it became\r\n     necessary to present another to the people. Accordingly in the\r\n     summer of 1875 delegates of the male citizens met in the capital\r\n     city. No outside pressure was brought to bear upon them to\r\n     influence their consideration of this subject. The grasshoppers\r\n     had ravaged the State the previous year, cutting off entirely the\r\n     principal crop of the country. Again in the spring of 1875, in\r\n     some of the river counties, the young had hatched in myriads, and\r\n     devoured the growing crops ere winging their way to their\r\n     mountain home. Gloom overspread the people at the prospect of\r\n     renewed disaster, and the dismal forebodings were realized even\r\n     as the delegates sat in council, for at this time occurred the\r\n     final appearance of the locust. As the people gazed into the sky\r\n     and watched the silver cloud floating in the sunshine resolve\r\n     itself into a miniature army clad in burnished steel, women\r\n     forgot to be concerned for their rights, and the delegates\r\n     thought only of completing their work with the utmost economy and\r\n     speed.\r\n\r\n     The new constitution, however, was formed on a more liberal\r\n     basis. Hon. R. B. Harrington, of Beatrice, in the Committee on\r\n     Bill of Rights, substituted the word \"people\" for \"men,\" and it\r\n     passed without comment. An article on amendments was embodied in\r\n     the constitution, the same in substance as the one defeated in\r\n     1871, under which, as was actually done in 1881, the legislature\r\n     could present amendments relating to suffrage.\r\n\r\n     The question of adopting the article relating to qualifications\r\n     of electors being before the convention. Judge Clinton Briggs of\r\n     Omaha sat during the reading of the first clause, \"every male,\"\r\n     etc., meditating, as he related to a friend, on how many lives\r\n     had been sacrificed and how many millions of money had been spent\r\n     in getting rid of the word \"white,\" which had made such an unjust\r\n     restriction, and how easy it would be, by one dash of the pen,\r\n     to blot out the word \"male,\" and thus abolish this other unjust\r\n     restriction. On the inspiration of the moment, he moved to strike\r\n     out the word \"male,\" R. B. Harrington relates that the motion of\r\n     Judge Briggs, who had not before expressed his sentiments, and\r\n     who had not consulted with the known advocates of the measure, so\r\n     astonished the convention that it was some time before they could\r\n     realize that he was in earnest. The friends rallied to Judge\r\n     Briggs' support. Gen. Chas. F. Manderson--a member of this, as of\r\n     the preceding convention--seconded the motion, and sustained it\r\n     with a forcible speech. Mr. Harrington made a speech in its\r\n     favor, and after a short and vigorous discussion it came to a\r\n     vote, which showed fifteen for the motion and fifty-two\r\n     against.[465]\r\n\r\n     About this time Nebraska was again visited by lecturers on woman\r\n     suffrage, who found an intelligent class of people, who, with\r\n     growing material prosperity, were kindly disposed toward\r\n     progressive ideas. Mrs. Margaret Campbell lectured in Nebraska in\r\n     1875, at about fifteen places between Kearney and the Missouri.\r\n     In 1877-8 and 9, Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony lectured at many\r\n     points. These, with some local lectures aroused an intelligent\r\n     interest in equal rights for women. It was attempted to give this\r\n     expression in the legislature of 1879. Resolutions were\r\n     introduced, favorable reports made and the subject treated with\r\n     kindly consideration, but for lack of time, or some one deeply\r\n     interested, nothing was accomplished.\r\n\r\n          The legislation of 1879 on the subject of equal suffrage\r\n          originated with Senator McMeans and C. B. Slocumb of\r\n          Fairbury. The former offered a petition from Thos. Harbine\r\n          and 160 others, asking a constitutional amendment\r\n          prohibiting the disfranchising of citizens on account of\r\n          sex. Referred to a committee of whom a majority recommended\r\n          that its consideration be indefinitely postponed. A minority\r\n          report was brought in by Orlando Tefft and Chas. H. Brown\r\n          recommending that the prayers of petitioners be granted. In\r\n          the House, at the same session, C. B. Slocumb presented the\r\n          petition of Calvin F. Steele and others, with a resolution\r\n          asking that the committee on constitutional amendments be\r\n          instructed to provide for the submission of an amendment\r\n          conferring the franchise upon woman. The resolution was\r\n          adopted, referred, and reported back with draft of an\r\n          amendment. The committee were Messrs. True, Windham, Batty,\r\n          Simonton, Mitchell, Sparks and Gaylord. On motion of Mr.\r\n          True the joint resolution was ordered to first reading; no\r\n          further mention appears of it.\r\n\r\n     The first suffrage society of the State was formed at Fairbury by\r\n     Mrs. H. Tyler Wilcox, and although this organization lived but a\r\n     short time, it secured petitions and drew the attention of\r\n     legislators elect--Senator McMeans and C. B. Slocumb--to the\r\n     general interest felt in Jefferson county. The second society was\r\n     formed in Thayer county. The sisters, Mrs. Davis and Mrs.\r\n     Cornell, of Alexandria, called a meeting, which resulted in\r\n     organizing the Alexandria Free Suffrage Association, Sept. 27,\r\n     1878. Prof. W. D. Vermilion and E. M. Correll of Hebron, lectured\r\n     before this society, but, most of the members living in the\r\n     country, the meetings were given up when the cold weather set\r\n     in.\r\n\r\n     The first working society was that of Hebron, which was organized\r\n     by Mrs. Stanton, April 15, 1879. The citizens were prepared for\r\n     the undertaking. E. M. Correll, editor of the Hebron _Journal_,\r\n     in editorials, in lectures by himself and others, had urged on\r\n     women the dignity and importance of interesting themselves in\r\n     their own behalf. The society had been encouraged by lectures\r\n     from Miss Couzins and Mrs. H. T. Wilcox, the latter taking the\r\n     ground then comparatively new, that woman's ballot is necessary\r\n     for successful temperance effort. Meetings were kept up regularly\r\n     and with increasing membership, and the Thayer County Woman\r\n     Suffrage Association won a deserved triumph in being primarily\r\n     connected with the origin and successful passage of the joint\r\n     resolution of 1881. The legislators elected in 1880 were Senator\r\n     C. B. Coon, and Representative E. M. Correll. Both these\r\n     gentlemen were active members of the Thayer County Association,\r\n     and after their election a committee waited on them, pledging\r\n     them to special effort during the coming session.\r\n\r\n     Meanwhile a general favorable sentiment was growing. In noting\r\n     this it would not be right to omit mention of Mrs. Harbert's\r\n     \"Woman's Kingdom,\" in the Chicago _Inter-Ocean_, which circulated\r\n     largely among country readers. The Omaha _Republican_ passed, in\r\n     1876, under the editorial management of D. C. Brooks, who, with\r\n     his wife, had been prominent in the suffrage work of Michigan and\r\n     Illinois. The favorable attitude of this paper, and the articles\r\n     which Mrs. Brooks from time to time contributed to it, exerted a\r\n     wide influence. In the winter of 1881, Mrs. Brooks established a\r\n     woman's department in the _Republican_ which crystallized the\r\n     growing interest around the leadership of its editor. Letters\r\n     were addressed to her from various sections of the State, urging\r\n     immediate action. The following from Mrs. Lucinda Russell will\r\n     show the interest felt:\r\n\r\n                                   TECUMSEH, Neb., December 4, 1880.\r\n\r\n          MRS. HARRIET S. BROOKS--_Dear Madam_: I have been shown a\r\n          form of petition for the suffrage which you enclosed to Rev.\r\n          Mary J. DeLong, of this place. Will you please inform me if\r\n          this is to be the form of petition to be presented during\r\n          the present session of the legislature? We wish the exact\r\n          words in order that we may have it published in our local\r\n          paper.\r\n\r\n          We think it best to call a meeting, even now at this\r\n          somewhat late day, and send women to Lincoln who will attend\r\n          personally to this matter. We have left these things\r\n          neglected too long. Will you call on all women of the State\r\n          who can do so to assemble at Lincoln during the session of\r\n          the legislature, appointing the day, etc.? I think we would\r\n          be surprised at the result. This town contains scarcely a\r\n          woman who is opposed to woman suffrage. We know we are a\r\n          power here; and we do not know but the same hearty support\r\n          which Tecumseh would afford may exist in many towns\r\n          throughout the State. All we need for good earnest work and\r\n          mighty results is organization.\r\n\r\n                                                       L. R.\r\n\r\n     In accordance with these requests a meeting for conference was\r\n     called at Lincoln, January 19, 1881, Mrs. Brooks presiding. A\r\n     second meeting was held at the M. E. Church, January 22, and a\r\n     Lincoln Woman Suffrage Association was formed. A mass convention\r\n     was held January 26, and a State Association was formed next\r\n     day:[466]\r\n\r\n          The meeting of January 26 was held in the opera-house and\r\n          was presided over by Mrs. Franc E. Finch. The speakers were\r\n          John B. Finch, Rev. Mary J. DeLong, Judge O. P. Mason and\r\n          Mrs. Esther L. Warner. Reading and music filled the\r\n          programme. Mrs. DeLong's address was in behalf of the\r\n          prohibitory and suffrage amendments. Judge Mason's address\r\n          was afterwards printed for distribution. It showed how\r\n          forcible and eloquent the Judge could be when on the right\r\n          side. It will be remembered that Judge Mason opposed woman\r\n          suffrage in the constitutional convention of 1871. His\r\n          closing sentences were:\r\n\r\n          The more intelligent and exalted the character of the\r\n          electors in a government whose foundation rests upon the\r\n          franchise, the more safe and secure are the liberties of the\r\n          people and the property of that government. The higher the\r\n          social and moral standard of the electors, the better will\r\n          be the type of manhood that is chosen to make laws and\r\n          administer the government. As you elevate the standard of\r\n          intelligence, and increase the ability and intensify the\r\n          power to recognize the right and a sense of obligation to\r\n          follow it, you make sure the foundations of civil and\r\n          religious liberty. You do more, you elevate the character of\r\n          the laws, and better the administration in every department\r\n          of government. It has been wisely said that government is\r\n          best which is best administered.\r\n\r\n          Do as we will, however, forget the rights of others, treat\r\n          them with contempt, summon to our aid the united efforts of\r\n          great political parties, invoke statutory and constitutional\r\n          law to aid us in the mad career, yet, let no one forget that\r\n          God's balances, watched by his angels, are hung across the\r\n          sky to weigh the conduct of individuals and nations, and\r\n          that in the end divine wisdom will pronounce the inexorable\r\n          judgment of compensatory justice.\r\n\r\n     Previous to all of these meetings Hon. E. M. Correll had\r\n     introduced on January 13, H. R. 59, a bill for an amendment to\r\n     the constitution striking the word \"male\" from qualifications of\r\n     electors. This had given impetus to the friends of the measure\r\n     and inspiration to the meetings. A vote of thanks was tendered\r\n     Mr. Correll by both the State and Thayer County Associations. The\r\n     bill not being technically correct, Mr. Correll introduced on\r\n     February 3, a joint resolution of the same purport, H. R. 162.\r\n     The committees of Senate and House on constitutional amendments\r\n     gave a hearing that evening to the advocates of the measure:\r\n\r\n          Of the fourteen members of the committees, ten were present;\r\n          the full number from the House and three from the Senate.\r\n          Mr. Correll pressed the claims of the resolution in the\r\n          first speech, and then introduced the different speakers\r\n          representing the State association. Mrs. Harriet S. Brooks\r\n          reviewed the progress of sentiment elsewhere and said that\r\n          her acquaintance and correspondence in this State led her to\r\n          think the time ripe for action of this kind. Mrs. Orpha\r\n          Clement Dinsmoor argued the abstract right of it, saying:\r\n\r\n          It has now come to the question of absolute right--whether\r\n          one class of people shall say to another: \"You can come only\r\n          thus far in the direction of liberty.\" We realize that woman\r\n          must be educated to this new privilege, just as man has been\r\n          educated to it, and just as this nation is now educating\r\n          millions of the newly enfranchised to it. Feeling that in\r\n          intellectual and moral capacity woman is the peer of man, I\r\n          think that her actual steps forward in needful preparation\r\n          have given her the right to say who shall rule over her.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Jennie F. Holmes based her remarks on the added\r\n          influence it would give women in securing wise legislation\r\n          in matters of welfare to the home. Clara B. Colby answered\r\n          questions of the committee. It was a most encouraging fact\r\n          that every member of the committee, after the speakers had\r\n          finished presenting the case, spoke in favor of the\r\n          amendment, except one, a Bohemian, who was suffering from\r\n          hoarseness and induced his colleague to express favorable\r\n          sentiments for him. These gentlemen all remained friendly to\r\n          the bill until its passage.\r\n\r\n     Headquarters were established in Lincoln. Mrs. Brooks remained\r\n     during the session, and Mesdames Holmes, Russell, Dinsmoor and\r\n     Colby all, or most of the time, until the act was passed,\r\n     interviewing the members and securing the promise of their votes\r\n     for the measure:\r\n\r\n          The joint resolution went through all the preliminary stages\r\n          in the House without opposition on account of the discretion\r\n          of its advocates, the watchfulness of its zealous friends\r\n          among the members, and the carefulness of Mr. Correll with\r\n          regard to all pending measures. The bill was made a special\r\n          order for February 18, 10:45 A. M., and Mrs. Brooks, Mrs.\r\n          Dinsmoor and Mrs. Colby addressed the House by invitation.\r\n          At the close of their remarks Mr. Roberts offered the\r\n          following:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That, as the sense of this House, we extend our\r\n          thanks to the ladies who have so ably addressed us in behalf\r\n          of female suffrage, and we wish them God-speed in their good\r\n          work.\r\n\r\n          On motion of Mr. Howe the resolution was unanimously\r\n          adopted. Mr. Correll moved that H. R. 162 be ordered\r\n          engrossed for third reading. The motion prevailed. The final\r\n          vote in the House, February 21, stood 51 for the amendment;\r\n          22 against.[467]\r\n\r\n     The passage of the bill had its dramatic features. Intense\r\n     interest was felt by the crowds which daily gathered in the\r\n     capitol to watch its progress, while the officers of the State\r\n     association were extended the courtesies of the floor, and came\r\n     and went, watching every opportunity and giving counsel and\r\n     assistance at every step. On this eventful Monday afternoon but\r\n     one of these was present, and she watched with anxiety the rapid\r\n     passage of the bills preceding, which made it evident that H. R.\r\n     162 would soon be reached. Six more than the needed number of\r\n     votes had been promised, but three of these were absent from the\r\n     city. There were barely enough members present to do business, as\r\n     important bills claimed attention in committee-rooms and lobbies.\r\n     The last bill ahead of this was reached, and the friends hurried\r\n     out in every direction to inform the members, who responded\r\n     quickly to the call. One man pledged to the amendment went out\r\n     and did not return, the only one to betray the measure.\r\n\r\n     The roll was called amid breathless interest and every one kept\r\n     the tally. Church Howe, in voting, said: \"I thank God that my\r\n     life has been spared to this moment, when I can vote to extend\r\n     the right of suffrage to the women of my adopted State.\" And C.\r\n     B. Slocumb responded to his name, \"Believing that my wife is\r\n     entitled to all the rights that I enjoy, I vote aye.\" The last\r\n     name had been called, and all knew that only fifty votes had been\r\n     cast for the amendment, lacking one of the required three-fifths\r\n     of all members elect. The chief clerk of the House, B. D.\r\n     Slaughter, usually so glib, slowly repeated the names of those\r\n     who had voted and more slowly footed up the result. Two\r\n     favorable members were outside; if only one could be reached! The\r\n     speaker, who had just voted against the amendment, but was kindly\r\n     disposed towards those interested in it, held the announcement\r\n     back for a moment which gave Church Howe time to move the\r\n     recommitment of the resolution. His motion was seconded all over\r\n     the House, but just at this juncture one of the absent friends,\r\n     P. O. Heacock, a German member from Richardson county, came in,\r\n     and, being told what was going on, called out, \"I desire to vote\r\n     on this bill.\" He walked quickly to his place and, in answer to\r\n     his name, voted \"aye.\" The speaker asked Mr. Howe if he wished to\r\n     withdraw his motion, which he did, and the vote was announced.\r\n     The galleries cheered, and the House was in a hubbub, unrebuked\r\n     by the speaker, who looked as happy as if he had voted for the\r\n     bill. The members gathered around the woman who sat in their\r\n     midst, shook hands and extended congratulations, many even who\r\n     had voted against the amendment expressing their personal\r\n     sympathy with its advocates.\r\n\r\n     The joint resolution was immediately sent to the Senate, where,\r\n     after its second reading, it was referred to the Committee on\r\n     Constitutional Amendments, who returned it with two reports:\r\n\r\n          That of the majority, recommended its passage, while the\r\n          minority opposed it on the ground that it would be\r\n          inadvisable to introduce opposing measures into the House\r\n          and thus create new divisions in politics and a new cause of\r\n          excitement; but principally upon the claim that in the\r\n          territory where female suffrage had obtained \"for a period\r\n          of two years\" the experiment had been disastrous, the\r\n          \"interests of the territory damaged in emigration,\" and the\r\n          administration of justice hindered in the courts. This\r\n          report was signed by Senators J. C. Myers and S. B. Taylor,\r\n          who had persistently refused to listen to argument or\r\n          information on the subject. As soon as the report was made,\r\n          the senators were informed of their glaring mistake as to\r\n          the length of time the women of Wyoming had voted, and\r\n          information was laid before them proving that the results in\r\n          that territory had been in every way beneficial,[468] but\r\n          they refused to withdraw or change their report.\r\n\r\n          The parliamentary tactics and watchfulness of Senators\r\n          Doane, Coon, Smith, White, Dinsmore, Harrington and Tefft\r\n          carried the bill through the bluster of the minority to its\r\n          final vote; by twenty-two for to eight against.[469] When\r\n          Senator Howe's name was called he offered the following\r\n          explanation:\r\n\r\n          The question of submitting this proposition to a vote of the\r\n          people is not to be regarded as a pleasantry, as some\r\n          members seem to think. However mischievously the experiment\r\n          of giving the suffrage to women may operate, the power once\r\n          given cannot be recalled. I have endeavored to look at the\r\n          question conscientiously. I desire to keep abreast of all\r\n          legitimate reforms of the day. I would like to see the moral\r\n          influence of women at the polls, but I would not like to see\r\n          the immoral influence of politics in the home circle. The\r\n          Almighty has imposed upon woman the highest office to which\r\n          human nature is subject, that of bearing children. Her life\r\n          is almost necessarily a home life; it should be largely\r\n          occupied in rearing and training her children to be good men\r\n          and pure electors. Therein her influence is all-powerful.\r\n          Again, I incline to the belief that to strike out the word\r\n          'male' in the constitution would not change its meaning so\r\n          as to confer the suffrage upon women. I am not acquainted\r\n          with half a dozen ladies who would accept the suffrage if it\r\n          were offered to them. They are not prepared for so radical a\r\n          change. For these reasons, briefly stated, and others, I\r\n          vote _No_.\r\n\r\n          Mr. Turner explained his vote as follows:\r\n\r\n          Our wives, mothers and sisters having an equal interest with\r\n          us in the welfare of our commonwealth, and being equal to\r\n          ourselves in intelligence, there appears no good reason why\r\n          the right to vote should be withheld from them. The genius\r\n          of our institutions is opposed to taxation without\r\n          representation; opposed to government without the consent of\r\n          the governed, and therefore I vote _Aye_.\r\n\r\n          The act was then signed by the president of the Senate and\r\n          speaker of the House, and sent to Gov. Nance. The latter,\r\n          who, although not personally an advocate of the measure, had\r\n          given all courtesy and assistance to its supporters, signed\r\n          it promptly. To take a bill like this, which even a minority\r\n          are anxious to defeat, through the intricate course of\r\n          legislation requires work, watchfulness and the utmost tact\r\n          and discretion on the part of its friends in both Houses.\r\n\r\n     The suffrage association immediately arranged to begin a canvass\r\n     of the State. The vice-president was appointed State organizer\r\n     and entered upon the duties of the office by forming a society at\r\n     Beatrice, March 5. The next step was to secure ample and\r\n     unimpeachable testimonials from Wyoming, which were printed in\r\n     _Woman's Work_, and then spread broadcast in leaflet form.\r\n     Lectures were given, and societies and working committees formed\r\n     as rapidly as possible. The _Western Woman's Journal_, a neat\r\n     monthly magazine, was established in May, by Hon. E. M. Correll,\r\n     and a host of women suddenly found themselves gifted with the\r\n     power to speak and write, which they consecrated to the cause of\r\n     their civil liberties.\r\n\r\n     The Thayer County Association, as the elder sister of the\r\n     numerous family now springing up, maintained its prominence as a\r\n     centre of activity and intelligence. Barbara J. Thompson,\r\n     secretary from its organization, wrote at this time of the\r\n     enthusiasm felt, and of the willingness of the women to work, but\r\n     added, \"nearly all our women are young mothers with from one to\r\n     five children, and these cannot do anything more than attend the\r\n     meetings occasionally when they can leave the children.\" This\r\n     might have been said of any society in the State, and this fact\r\n     must be considered in judging from their achievements of the zeal\r\n     of the Nebraska women. Few, comparatively, could take a public\r\n     part, and all others were constantly reckoned by opponents as\r\n     unwilling or indifferent. Thayer County Association celebrated\r\n     the Fourth of July in a novel manner, making every feature an\r\n     object lesson. _Woman's Work_ gave an account of it at the time,\r\n     which is quoted to give a pleasant glance backward at the\r\n     enthusiasm and interest that marked the work of this society:\r\n\r\n          We found to our surprise that the women of Thayer county had\r\n          in charge the whole celebration. The Fourth dawned cool and\r\n          clear, and with news of the improvement of Garfield,\r\n          everybody felt happy. The procession, marshaled by ladies on\r\n          their handsome horses, and assisted by Senator C. B. Coon,\r\n          was formed in due time, and presented a very imposing\r\n          appearance. The band wagon was followed by nearly a hundred\r\n          others, and among the novelties of the occasion was the\r\n          boys' brigade, consisting of a score of little fellows,\r\n          some with drums and some with cornets, who played in quite\r\n          tolerable time. The States were represented to indicate\r\n          their progress with regard to equal rights. Young men\r\n          represented those wherein no advance had been made; young\r\n          women those where school suffrage had been granted to women;\r\n          and Wyoming Territory was represented by two, a man and a\r\n          woman. The little girls were all dressed in the appropriate\r\n          colors, the wagons were gaily decorated, and the procession\r\n          well managed. After singing and prayer, the president, Mrs.\r\n          Ferguson, gave a short address. Mrs. Vermilion, who is a\r\n          direct descendant of one of the signers of the Declaration\r\n          of Independence, read the Woman's Declaration of\r\n          Independence and Bill of Rights, a document couched in such\r\n          forcible terms as Hancock, Adams & Co., would use if they\r\n          were women in this year of our Lord 1881. Then followed the\r\n          oration of the day, delivered by Mrs. Colby, and for the\r\n          audience it had at least two points of interest: First, that\r\n          the woman suffrage society had acted in defiance of\r\n          precedent, and had engaged a woman as their orator; and\r\n          secondly, that it was given from the standpoint of a citizen\r\n          and not of a woman. There being nothing in the address on\r\n          the matter of woman suffrage, the society desired the\r\n          speaker to address them in the evening on that subject.\r\n          Accordingly a meeting was held, and despite the fatigue of\r\n          the day, there was a good attendance and considerable\r\n          interest. A good dinner was provided on the grounds, and\r\n          afterwards they had singing and speaking. Mr. Hendershot\r\n          addressed the children. It will be an item of interest to\r\n          the readers of the _Express_ that the W. S. A. of Thayer\r\n          county have had some songs printed appropriate for their\r\n          use. Among them is \"Hold the Polls,\" a song by the editor of\r\n          the _Express_, and this was sung with considerable\r\n          enthusiasm. It may be said that the whole affair was a\r\n          success, and reflected great credit on the executive ability\r\n          of the ladies in charge. One item of interest must not be\r\n          forgotten--among the various banners indicative of the\r\n          virtues which are worthy of cultivation, was one whose motto\r\n          read, \"In Mother we Trust.\" A lady being asked the peculiar\r\n          significance of this, said, \"It has always been God and\r\n          father, now we want the children to learn to trust their\r\n          mothers, and to think they are of some account.\"\r\n\r\n     A successful State convention was held at Omaha July 6, 7, Mrs.\r\n     Brooks presiding and making the opening address. The address of\r\n     Mrs. Ada M. Bittenbender on \"The Legal Disabilities of Married\r\n     Women\" created quite a discussion among a number of noted lawyers\r\n     present. Of this the _Republican_ said:\r\n\r\n          This lady is the well-known recent editor of the Osceola\r\n          _Record_, which she has now relinquished for the study and\r\n          practice of law, in partnership with her husband. Her\r\n          address, although learned, elaborate, comprehensive, and\r\n          dealing with principles and technicalities, was delivered\r\n          extemporaneously, with great animation and effect, and in a\r\n          manner at once womanly, captivating and strong.\r\n\r\n     Miss Ida Edson read a paper on \"Might and Right.\" Mrs. Bloomer,\r\n     whose presence was an interesting feature of the convention, gave\r\n     reminiscences of her own work for woman's ballot in Nebraska. The\r\n     convention was enlivened by the dramatic readings of Mrs. H. P.\r\n     Mathewson, and the inspiring ballads of the poet-singer, James G.\r\n     Clark, who had come from Colorado to attend the meeting. A\r\n     glimpse at the convention through the friendly eyes of the editor\r\n     of the _Republican_ will indicate the interest and ability shown\r\n     by the women of the State:\r\n\r\n          The first general convention of the Woman's State Suffrage\r\n          Association commenced its session last evening at Masonic\r\n          hall, the president, Mrs. Harriet S. Brooks, in the chair,\r\n          assisted by the first vice-president, Mrs. Clara B. Colby of\r\n          Beatrice; the secretary, Mrs. A. M. Bittenbender of Osceola;\r\n          and the treasurer, Mrs. Russell of Tecumseh. A majority of\r\n          the members of the executive committee and of the\r\n          vice-presidents were also present, with several friends of\r\n          the cause from abroad, including Hon. E. M. Correll, editor\r\n          of the _Western Woman's Journal_, who was the \"leader of the\r\n          House\" on the bill for submitting the suffrage amendment to\r\n          the people. The evening was sultry and threatening, and\r\n          Masonic hall was not so full as it would otherwise have\r\n          been, considering both \"promise and performance.\" The local\r\n          attendance was representative, including quite a number of\r\n          our leading citizens, with their wives, and the editors of\r\n          our contemporaries the _Herald_ and the _Bee_. The meeting\r\n          was a very interesting one, more especially the\r\n          \"conversational\" portion, in which free discussion was\r\n          solicited. This was opened by Hon. E. Rosewater, who spoke\r\n          in response to a very general call. His address of half an\r\n          hour in length was marked by apparent sincerity, and was a\r\n          calm and argumentative presentation of objections,\r\n          theoretical and practical, which occurred to him against the\r\n          extension of the franchise to women. It was replied to by\r\n          Mrs. Colby, in a running comment, which abounded in womanly\r\n          wisdom and wit, and incessantly brought down the house. Our\r\n          restricted space will compel us to forego a report of the\r\n          discussion at present. On the conclusion of Mrs. Colby's\r\n          very bright and convincing remarks, Dr. McNamara addressed\r\n          the convention in a brief speech of great earnestness, depth\r\n          and power.\r\n\r\n          The last session was most interesting. The hall was nearly\r\n          filled, and among the audience were representatives of many\r\n          of our leading families. There was rather too much crowded\r\n          into this session, but the convention \"cleaned up\" its work\r\n          thoroughly, and the audience displayed a patient interest to\r\n          the very end. Besides the address of Professor Clark, there\r\n          was a masterly constitutional argument by Mrs. Clara B.\r\n          Colby, which demonstrated that woman can argue logically,\r\n          and can support her postulates with the requisite legal\r\n          learning, embracing a knowledge of the common and statute\r\n          law authorities from Blackstone down. The address abounded\r\n          in historical and literary allusions which show its author\r\n          to be a person of broad culture as well as an adept in \"book\r\n          learning.\" Following came another address from Mrs. Bloomer,\r\n          in which she disposed--as he expressed, to Dr. McNamara's\r\n          entire satisfaction--of the stock biblical argument down\r\n          from Moses to Paul against \"woman's rights\" to act in the\r\n          same spheres, and speak from the same platform with men.\r\n          This address was given at the special request of several\r\n          leading ladies of this city, and though the hour was late,\r\n          it was received with unbroken interest, and was complimented\r\n          with a special vote of thanks, moved by Mrs. Colby. Most\r\n          interesting reports of district and local work were made by\r\n          Mrs. Holmes, of Tecumseh, Mrs. Chapin of Riverton, and Mrs.\r\n          Slaughter of Osceola. Dr. McNamara closed the convention\r\n          with a few stirring words of exhortation to the ladies to go\r\n          right to work from now on to November, 1882. He excused\r\n          himself from a set speech with the promise that, if \"let\r\n          off\" now, he would, at some future time, present a full\r\n          expression of his views on the reform to which he has so\r\n          earnestly pledged himself. The closing word in which the\r\n          _Republican_ would sum up the varied proceedings of the\r\n          first State suffrage convention is the magic word success.\r\n\r\n     A second very successful convention was held at Kearney, October\r\n     19, 20. A score or more societies were represented by delegates\r\n     and their reports were very encouraging.\r\n\r\n          The principal features of the programme were: Address of\r\n          president, Harriet S. Brooks; welcome, Mrs. H. S. Sydenham;\r\n          response, Mrs. A. P. Nicholas; addresses by Mrs. Esther L.\r\n          Warner, Gen. S. H. Connor (whose name appeared among the\r\n          votes of the opponents in 1875); Mrs. Orpha C. Dinsmoor, on\r\n          \"Inherent Rights\"; L. B. Fifield, regent of the State\r\n          University, on \"Woman's Influence for Women\"; and Rev.\r\n          Crissman, resident Presbyterian minister, on \"Expediency.\"\r\n          Among the letters received was the following, addressed to\r\n          Mrs. Dinsmoor, by Gen. Manderson, whose name has been\r\n          mentioned as voting for woman's ballot in the constitutional\r\n          conventions of 1871 and 1875:\r\n\r\n                                             OMAHA, October, 17.\r\n\r\n          Your esteemed favor inviting me to speak before the\r\n          convention at Kearney, October 18, 19, upon the subject of\r\n          the extension of suffrage to women, was duly received. I\r\n          have delayed replying to it until to day in the hope that my\r\n          professional engagements would permit me to meet with you at\r\n          Kearney. The continuing session of our District Court\r\n          prevents my absence at this time. I would like very much to\r\n          be with you at the meeting of your association. My desire,\r\n          however, would be to hear rather than to speak. Ten years\r\n          have passed since, with other members of the constitutional\r\n          convention of 1871, I met in argument those who opposed\r\n          striking the word \"male\" from the constitution of Nebraska.\r\n          In those days \"the truth was mighty and prevailed,\" almost\r\n          to the extent of full success, for, as the result of our\r\n          effort, we saw the little band of thirteen increase to\r\n          thirty. I feel that there must be much of new thought and\r\n          rich argument growing from the agitation of the last ten\r\n          years, and to listen to those who, like yourself and many\r\n          other members of your association, have been in the\r\n          forefront of the battle for the right, would be most\r\n          interesting. But I must, for the present, forego the\r\n          pleasure of hearing you. I write merely to keep myself \"on\r\n          the record\" in the good fight. Now, as ever, I favor the\r\n          enfranchisement of women, the disfranchisement of ignorance.\r\n          I would both extend and contract the right to vote in our\r\n          republic; extend it so that intelligence without regard to\r\n          color or sex should rule, and contract it so that ignorance\r\n          should be ruled. If this be not the cure for the political\r\n          ills that threaten the permanency of American institutions,\r\n          then there is no cure. May Nebraska be the first of the\r\n          States to apply the remedy.\r\n\r\n                         Very respectfully yours, CHARLES F. MANDERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clara Bewick Colby]\r\n\r\n\r\n     The association sent out its scouts, and as a result a convention\r\n     was held in quite the northern part of the State, at Norfolk,\r\n     November 30 and December 1. This was much appreciated by the\r\n     citizens, whose locality was at that time not much frequented by\r\n     speakers on any topic.[470] The first annual meeting, held at\r\n     Lincoln in February, 1882, found a large number of delegates,\r\n     each with reports of kindred local work, ready to receive the\r\n     record of this year of preparation. Everything indicated a\r\n     favorable termination to the effort, as it became evident that\r\n     all sections of the State were being aroused to active interest.\r\n\r\n          The address of the president, Mrs. Harriet S. Brooks, was\r\n          entitled, \"Work, Wages and the Ballot.\" It was a review of a\r\n          lecture given earlier in the season by Chancellor Fairchild\r\n          of the University, in which he had taken the ground that the\r\n          work of women should not receive the same wages as that of\r\n          men. Rev. Dr. McNamara and others spoke briefly and\r\n          earnestly. Miss Lydia Bell, at the closing evening session,\r\n          gave an address which, to use the words of the reporter,\r\n          \"for felicity of composition, strength of argument, and\r\n          beauty of delivery, fully merited the special resolution of\r\n          thanks unanimously given by the society.\"[471]\r\n\r\n     The work of organizing and lecturing was continued with as much\r\n     zeal and efficiency as the busy days and limited resources of the\r\n     women would permit. Many of the counties held conventions, took\r\n     count of their friends, and prepared for a vigorous campaign. As\r\n     the summer advanced, at picnics, old settlers' gatherings,\r\n     soldiers' reuenions, fairs, and political conventions,--wherever\r\n     a company of people had assembled, there interested women claimed\r\n     an opportunity to present the subject to audiences it would\r\n     otherwise have been impossible to reach. With but few exceptions,\r\n     officials extended the courtesies asked.\r\n\r\n     During the summer of 1882, the work was greatly aided by the\r\n     lectures of Margaret Campbell and Matilda Hindman; and during the\r\n     month of September by Helen M. Gougar. The American Suffrage\r\n     Association, at its annual meeting in 1881, elected Hon. E. M.\r\n     Correll president, as a recognition of his services to the cause\r\n     in Nebraska, and in 1882, it held its annual meeting in Omaha,\r\n     September 12 and 13. Lucy Stone, H. B. Blackwell, and Hannah\r\n     Tracy Cutler remained for some weeks, lecturing in the State, and\r\n     were warmly received by the local committees. Ex-Governor John W.\r\n     Hoyt, and Judge Kingman, of Wyoming, gave a few addresses. The\r\n     National Association also held its annual meeting at Omaha, Sept.\r\n     26, 27, 28. A reception was given at the Paxton Hotel on the\r\n     close of the last session. Following this, a two days' convention\r\n     was held at Lincoln, from which point the speakers diverged to\r\n     take part in the campaign.[472]\r\n\r\n     While those friendly to the amendment were laboring thus\r\n     earnestly, the politicians held themselves aloof and attended\r\n     strictly to \"mending their own fences.\" After the act had passed\r\n     the legislature, it was found that almost every prominent man in\r\n     the State was friendly to the amendment. The bench and bar were\r\n     especially favorable, while three-fourths of the press and a\r\n     large majority of the clergy warmly espoused the cause. Leading\r\n     politicians told the women to go ahead and organize, and they\r\n     would assist in the latter part of the canvass. Thayer and Clay\r\n     county Republicans endorsed woman suffrage in their platform,\r\n     while Franklin county delegates were instructed to vote for no\r\n     one who was not in favor of the amendment.\r\n\r\n     Previous to the session of the Republican State Convention, great\r\n     hopes were entertained that this body would put an endorsement of\r\n     the amendment in its platform, as a majority of the delegates\r\n     were personally pledged to vote for such a measure. But the\r\n     committee on resolutions was managed by a man who feared that\r\n     such endorsement would hurt the party, and the suffrage\r\n     resolution which was handed in, was not reported with the rest.\r\n     On the plea of time being precious, the convention was maneuvered\r\n     to pass a resolution that the report of the committee should not\r\n     be discussed. The report was brought in at the last moment of the\r\n     convention, and adopted as previously arranged, and the\r\n     convention was adjourned, everybody wondering why a resolution\r\n     relative to the amendment had not been presented. The Republican\r\n     leaders feared that their party was endangered by the passage of\r\n     the bill by the legislature, for it was very largely carried by\r\n     Republican votes, and while individually friendly, they almost to\r\n     a man avoided the subject.\r\n\r\n     As the canvass progressed, it was comical to note how shy the\r\n     politicians fought of the women to whom they had promised\r\n     assistance. Judge O. P. Mason, who had agreed to give ten\r\n     lectures for the amendment, and whose advocacy would have had\r\n     immense weight, engaged to speak for the Republican party, and at\r\n     every place but one, the managers stipulated that he should be\r\n     silent on the amendment. Of the vast array of Republican\r\n     speakers, had even those who had expressed themselves in favor of\r\n     the amendment advocated it intelligently and earnestly, the\r\n     result would have been different.\r\n\r\n     Due credit must be given to ex-United States Senator Tipton,\r\n     Judge W. H. Morris, and a few others who lectured outside of\r\n     their own counties, as well as at home, while David Butler,\r\n     candidate for senator from Pawnee county, E. M. Correll of\r\n     Hebron, C. C. Chapin of Riverton, Judge A. P. Yocum of Hastings,\r\n     and doubtless a few others, regardless of their political\r\n     prospects, advocated the cause of woman along with their own. The\r\n     women of Nebraska will always cherish the memory of the\r\n     enthusiastic young student from Ann Arbor, Michigan, who spent\r\n     some months of the campaign in Nebraska, giving lavishly of his\r\n     means and talents to aid the cause. Wilder M. Wooster was a\r\n     bright, logical speaker, and his death, which occurred in 1885,\r\n     cost the world a promising and conscientious journalist.\r\n\r\n     Towards the close of the campaign it became evident that the\r\n     saloon element was determined to defeat the amendment. The organ\r\n     of the Brewers' Association sent out its orders to every saloon,\r\n     bills posted in conspicuous places by friends of the amendment\r\n     mysteriously disappeared, or were covered by others of an\r\n     opposite character, and the greatest pains was taken to excite\r\n     the antagonism of foreigners by representing to them that woman\r\n     suffrage meant prohibition. On the other hand, the temperance\r\n     advocates were by no means a unit for its support.\r\n\r\n     The morning dawned bright and clear on November 5, 1882. The most\r\n     casual observer would have seen that some unusual interest was\r\n     commanding attention. Everything wore a holiday appearance.\r\n     Polling places were gaily decorated; banners floated to the\r\n     breeze, bearing suggestive mottoes: \"Are Women Citizens?\"\r\n     \"Taxation Without Representation is Tyranny!\" \"Governments Derive\r\n     their Just Powers from the Consent of the Governed.\" \"Equality\r\n     before the Law,\" etc., etc. Under pavilions, or in adjoining\r\n     rooms, or in the very shadow of the ballot-box, women presided at\r\n     well-filled tables, serving refreshments to the voters, and\r\n     handing to those who would take them, tickets bearing the words:\r\n     \"For Constitutional Amendment Relating to Right of Suffrage,\"\r\n     while the national colors floated alike over governing and\r\n     governed; alike over women working and pleading for their rights\r\n     as citizens, and men who were selling woman's birth-right for a\r\n     glass of beer or a vote. It looked like a holiday picnic--the\r\n     well-dressed people, the flowers, the badges, and the flags; but\r\n     the tragic events of that day would fill a volume.\r\n\r\n     The conservative joined hands with the vicious, the egotist with\r\n     the ignorant, the demagogue with the venial, and when the sun\r\n     set, Nebraska's opportunity to do the act of simple justice was\r\n     gone--lost by a vote of 50,693 to 25,756--so the record gives\r\n     it. But it must not be forgotten that many tickets were\r\n     fraudulently printed, and that tickets which contained no mention\r\n     of the amendment were counted against it, as also were tickets\r\n     having any technical defect or omission; for instance, tickets\r\n     having the abbreviated form, \"For the Amendment,\" were counted\r\n     against it. It will always remain an open question whether the\r\n     amendment did not, after all, receive an actual majority of all\r\n     votes cast upon that question. In this new State, burdened with\r\n     the duties incident to the development of a new country, the\r\n     women had done what women might do to secure their rights, but\r\n     their hour had not yet struck.\r\n\r\n     On the following evening, the speakers of the National\r\n     Association, who still remained in the State held a meeting[473]\r\n     at the opera-house in Omaha, at which the addresses were in the\r\n     main congratulatory for the large vote, making proportionally the\r\n     largest ever cast for woman's ballot.\r\n\r\n     While history must perforce be silent concerning the efforts and\r\n     sacrifices of the many, a word will be expected in regard to some\r\n     of the principal actors. Looking back on these two eventful\r\n     years, not a woman who took part in that struggle would wish to\r\n     have been inactive in that heroic hour. It is an inspiration and\r\n     an ennobling of all the faculties that they have once been lifted\r\n     above all personal aims and transient interests; and for all who\r\n     caught the true meaning of the moment, life can never again touch\r\n     the low level of indifference. The officers of the State\r\n     Association who were most active in the canvass are here\r\n     mentioned with a word as to their subsequent efforts:\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Harriet S. Brooks, whose services have so often been\r\n          referred to, after working in three States for the\r\n          privileges of citizenship, is devoting herself to the\r\n          congenial study of sociology, and her able pen still does\r\n          service.\r\n\r\n          Ada M. Bittenbender was admitted to the bar May 17, 1882,\r\n          and from that time until the election gave undivided\r\n          attention to the duties of her office as president of the\r\n          State Association. The campaign song-book, the supplement\r\n          folded in the county papers, the columns of notes and news\r\n          prepared for many journals in the State, the headquarters in\r\n          Lincoln from which, with the assistance of E. M. Correll and\r\n          Mrs. Russell, she sent forth documents, posters, blanks and\r\n          other campaign accessories, sufficiently attest her energy\r\n          and ability. She is now a practicing lawyer of Lincoln, and\r\n          was successful during the session of the legislature of 1885\r\n          in securing the passage of a law making mothers joint and\r\n          equal guardians of their children.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Belle G. Bigelow of Geneva was an active and reliable\r\n          officer during the canvass of 1882, and is now prominent in\r\n          the temperance work of Nebraska.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Lucinda Russell of Tecumseh, for two years the\r\n          treasurer of the State Association, edited a department in\r\n          the local paper in the interest of the amendment, was one of\r\n          the campaign committee, and spared no effort to push the\r\n          work in her own county. Her sister, Mrs. Jennie F. Holmes,\r\n          was one of the most efficient members of the executive\r\n          committee. She drove all over her own county, holding\r\n          meetings in the school-houses. The efforts of these two\r\n          women would have carried Johnson county for the amendment\r\n          had not the election officials taken advantage of a\r\n          technical defect in the tickets used in some of the\r\n          precincts. Mrs. Holmes sustained the suffrage work in\r\n          Nebraska through the two following years as chairman of the\r\n          executive committee, was elected in 1884 to the office of\r\n          president of the State Woman's Christian Temperance Union,\r\n          and reelected in 1885 to the same position.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Orpha C. Dinsmoor of Omaha, as chairman of the\r\n          executive committee during the first year (Mrs. De Long\r\n          having resigned), contributed largely to the most successful\r\n          conventions of the campaign. One of the most notable\r\n          lectures given in the State was hers in reply to Chancellor\r\n          Fairfield of the Nebraska University, on \"Work and Wages.\"\r\n          As it was known that the chancellor held the ground that\r\n          woman should not be paid equally with man, even for the same\r\n          work and the same skill, the Lincoln Woman Suffrage\r\n          Association invited him to give his lecture on that subject,\r\n          and Mrs. Dinsmoor to answer him on the following evening.\r\n          Mrs. Dinsmoor is well known for her interest in education\r\n          and scientific charity, and has, by appointment of the\r\n          governor of the State, represented Nebraska at the National\r\n          Conference of Charities and Corrections at its last two\r\n          annual meetings. She is now the president of the Nebraska\r\n          Woman's Board of Associated Charities.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Barbara J. Thompson, of English birth, was one of the\r\n          leading spirits of the Thayer County Society, and was active\r\n          in holding meetings and organizing committees. Her principal\r\n          service was by her ready pen, which furnished articles for a\r\n          large number of papers. It is pleasant to reflect that one\r\n          woman who worked so earnestly for the rights of citizenship\r\n          in Nebraska has obtained them in her new home at Tacoma,\r\n          Washington Territory.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Gertrude McDowell of Fairbury lent her wit and wisdom\r\n          to many conventions, was ready with her pen, and secured a\r\n          thorough canvass in Jefferson county. She was the third\r\n          president of the State Association.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Mollie K. Maule of Fairmont laid by her law studies to\r\n          serve on the executive board of the State Association. In\r\n          company with Mrs. Susie Fifield and others, she held\r\n          meetings in all the precincts of Fillmore county, securing a\r\n          good vote. Mrs. Maule was elected president of the State\r\n          Association in 1885.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Jennie G. Ford of Kearney, for some time member of the\r\n          executive committee, was one of the leading advocates in\r\n          Buffalo county. Always aiding and inspiring others to\r\n          effort, she was an incessant worker in the causes dear to\r\n          her heart. She was president of the Nebraska Woman's\r\n          Christian Temperance Union from 1882 to 1884. She died June\r\n          18, 1885, leaving in the hearts of all who had known her,\r\n          tender memories of her beautiful life.\r\n\r\n          Miss Lydia Bell, a talented elocutionist of Lincoln, devoted\r\n          some months to lecturing. Her great intellectual and\r\n          rhetorical gifts made her a very effective speaker.\r\n\r\n          Dr. Hetty K. Painter was a graduate of the Pennsylvania\r\n          Medical College in 1860. She was a physician in the army\r\n          during the civil war, and her proudest possession is the\r\n          badge which proves her membership in the Fifth Army Corps.\r\n          Her practice and her infirmary at Lincoln did not prevent\r\n          her helping largely the cause in which she felt so great an\r\n          interest.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Esther L. Warner of Roca was the only person actively\r\n          engaged in the last canvass who had been connected with the\r\n          effort of 1871. As vice-president of her judicial district,\r\n          she spoke at many places, organizing wherever practicable.\r\n          Her motherly face, and persuasive but humorous argument,\r\n          made her a favorite at conventions. Coming to Nebraska in\r\n          its early days, a widow with a large family, she purchased a\r\n          large farm and devoted herself to its management, to the\r\n          care and education of her children, and to the direction of\r\n          the village school, being a member of the board of trustees\r\n          for many years. She had not used tongue or pen for public\r\n          service since her girlhood until this occasion enlisted her\r\n          interest and proved her gifts.\r\n\r\n          Clara C. Chapin, _La Petite_, as she was called at\r\n          conventions, or as a friend styles her, \"the dear little\r\n          English bud that blossomed on American soil,\" was one of the\r\n          most zealous of our women, organizing, lecturing and\r\n          arranging campaigns. She is at present very active in the\r\n          temperance work, and is one of the editors of a State\r\n          temperance paper, the _Republican Valley Echo_. An extract\r\n          from a letter received from her in answer to inquiry will\r\n          show the spirit that actuates this representative advocate\r\n          of woman's political enfranchisement:\r\n\r\n          I never thought much about \"woman's rights\" until within the\r\n          last five years--that is, _political_ rights. I always had a\r\n          strong sense of my responsibilities as a woman and a mother\r\n          (have three children), and realize that we need something\r\n          more than moral suasion to make our influence practical and\r\n          effective. My husband, though not what is called a\r\n          \"politician,\" has been sufficiently in politics for me to\r\n          know just what power the ballot has, and to see the\r\n          necessity of woman's work in that direction. I am happy to\r\n          say that Mr. Chapin is heart and soul with me in this, and\r\n          it is a wonder to us how any wife or mother, how any\r\n          Christian woman can say, \"I have all the rights I want.\"\r\n\r\n     Hoping to hold the vantage ground already gained, a State\r\n     convention was held at Kearney, December 6, 7, the place being\r\n     selected because Buffalo county had carried the amendment by a\r\n     good majority.\r\n\r\n          The association held three formal sessions, which were well\r\n          attended and very interesting. Speeches of encouragement and\r\n          congratulation were made, plans for work discussed, and\r\n          campaign reminiscences recounted. One of the most\r\n          interesting that was given was that of Mrs. Beedy of Gardner\r\n          precinct, who said that the women actively interested in the\r\n          suffrage work talked socially on the subject with every man\r\n          in the precinct. There were seventy-two votes, and only four\r\n          against the amendment. Of these four persons, two could\r\n          neither read nor write, a third could not write his own\r\n          name, and the fourth could not write his name in English.\r\n          All the delegates present reported that the social work had\r\n          been a prime cause of such success as they had found. Mrs.\r\n          Bigelow said that Geneva precinct stood ninety-eight for the\r\n          amendment and ninety-eight against. At Fairmont sixty ladies\r\n          went to the polls. They wore white ribbon badges on which\r\n          was printed, \"Are we citizens?\" The general impression among\r\n          those attending the convention was that the Association\r\n          should petition congress for a sixteenth amendment, petition\r\n          the Nebraska legislature for municipal suffrage, and make\r\n          use of school suffrage to its fullest extent. The executive\r\n          committee held four sessions, appointed a number of working\r\n          committees, and attended to settling up the campaign\r\n          business of the Association. The convention was considered a\r\n          decided success in every way.\r\n\r\n     The annual meeting was held in January, 1883. Mrs. Gertrude\r\n     McDowell was elected president. The usual business was\r\n     transacted, and a special committee appointed to secure favorable\r\n     legislation. In view of the fact that so much of the opposition\r\n     had been based on the allegation that \"women do not want to\r\n     vote,\" a resolution was prepared for the immediate re-submission\r\n     of a constitutional amendment with a provision making it legal\r\n     for women to vote on its final ratification. The joint resolution\r\n     was introduced by Senator Charles H. Brown of Omaha, and ably\r\n     advocated by him and others, especially by Senator David Butler.\r\n     It was lost by nearly a two-thirds vote. The Committee on\r\n     Amendments gave a hearing to Lydia Bell, Clara C. Chapin and\r\n     Clara B. Colby. The joint resolution was taken up in the Senate\r\n     for discussion February 15. _Woman's Work_ gives the record of\r\n     the proceedings:\r\n\r\n          Senator McShane of Douglas moved indefinite postponement.\r\n          Senator Brown of Douglas, who introduced the resolution,\r\n          spoke against the motion and made a forcible historical\r\n          argument for the bill. Senator McShane then spoke at length\r\n          against the bill, basing his opposition to the\r\n          enfranchisement of woman on the ground that it would be\r\n          detrimental to the interests of the foreigner. Senator\r\n          Schoenheit of Richardson opposed the bill on the plea that it\r\n          would mar the loveliness of woman in her domestic relations.\r\n          Senator Reynolds of Butler favored the bill. He had voted\r\n          against the amendment last fall, but he did it because he\r\n          feared the women did not want the ballot, and he was willing\r\n          to let them decide for themselves. Senator Dech of Saunders\r\n          favored the bill in remarks showing a broad and\r\n          comprehensive philosophy. Senator Butler of Pawnee made a\r\n          magnificent arraignment of the Republican and Democratic\r\n          parties, and an appeal to the anti-monopolists to oppose the\r\n          monopoly of sex. His speech was the longest and most\r\n          earnest of the session. Several persons expressing a desire\r\n          to continue the discussion, McShane withdrew his motion to\r\n          postpone. The Senate adjourned, and on Friday morning it was\r\n          moved and carried that this bill be made the special order\r\n          for that evening. Accordingly, the chamber and gallery were\r\n          filled. On motion, Mrs. Colby was unanimously requested to\r\n          address the Senate in behalf of the bill. Senator Butler\r\n          escorted her to the clerk's desk, and she delivered an\r\n          extemporaneous address, of which a fair synopsis was given\r\n          by the _Journal_ reporter. Foreseeing the defeat of the\r\n          bill, she said, in closing, \"You may kill this bill,\r\n          gentlemen, but you cannot kill the principle of individual\r\n          liberty that is at issue. It is immortal, and rises\r\n          Phoenix-like from every death to a new life of surpassing\r\n          beauty and vigor. The votes you cast against the bill will,\r\n          like the dragons' teeth in the myth of old, spring up into\r\n          armed warriors that shall obstruct your path, demanding of\r\n          you the recognition of woman's right to 'equality before the\r\n          law.'\" The grave and reverend senators joined in the\r\n          applause of the gallery, and carried Senator Reynolds'\r\n          motion \"that the thanks of this Senate be returned to Mrs.\r\n          Colby for the able, eloquent and instructive address to\r\n          which we have listened\"; but with no apparent reluctance, on\r\n          Senator McShane's motion being renewed, they postponed the\r\n          bill by a vote of 18 to 6.[474] Of the absent ones, Senator\r\n          Dech was known to be sick, some of the others were in their\r\n          seats a moment previous, and it is fairly to be presumed\r\n          that they did not dare to vote upon the question. Of those\r\n          voting aye, Senators Brown of Clay, and Walker of Lancaster\r\n          had favored the bill in the committee, and the friends were\r\n          counting on their vote, as also some others who had\r\n          expressed themselves favorable. It is due to Senators Brown\r\n          of Douglas and Butler to say that they championed the bill\r\n          heartily, and furthered its interests in every possible way.\r\n\r\n     Conventions were held at Grand Island in May, at Hastings in\r\n     August of 1883, and at Fremont August, 1884. The annual meeting\r\n     of 1884 was held at York, and that of 1885 in Lincoln. At all of\r\n     these enthusiasm and interest were manifested, which indicate\r\n     that the idea has not lost its foothold. The _Woman's Tribune_,\r\n     established in 1883, circulates largely in the State, and\r\n     maintains an intelligent if not an active interest. When a new\r\n     occasion comes the women will be able to meet it. Their present\r\n     attitude of hopeful waiting has the courage and faith expressed\r\n     in the words of Lowell:\r\n\r\n          \"Endurance is the crowning quality,\r\n          And patience all the passion of great hearts;\r\n          These are their stay, and when the hard world\r\n          With brute strength, like scornful conqueror,\r\n          Clangs his huge mace down in the other scale,\r\n          The inspired soul but flings his patience in,\r\n          And slowly that out-weighs the ponderous globe;\r\n          One faith against a whole world's unbelief,\r\n          One soul against the flesh of all mankind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[457] Having visited Beatrice twice to speak in different courses\r\nof lectures arranged by Mrs. Colby, I can testify to her executive\r\nability alike in her domestic and public work. She can get up a\r\nmeeting, arrange the platform, with desk and lights, and introduce\r\na speaker with as much skill and grace as she can spread a table\r\nwith dainty china and appetizing food, and enliven a dinner with\r\nwitty and earnest conversation.--[E. C. S.\r\n\r\n[458] _Yeas_--Messrs. Boulwere, Buck, Campbell, Chambers, Clancy,\r\nDavis, Decker, Hail, Haygood, Hoover, Kirk, Larimer, Rose,\r\nSullivan--14.\r\n\r\n_Nays_--Messrs. Beck, Bowen, Gibson, Harsh, Laird, Miller, Moore,\r\nMorton, McDonald, Riden, Salisbury--11.\r\n\r\n[459] It is a pleasure to record that both these gentlemen have\r\nreached the logical result of their former views, and now advocate\r\ngiving the franchise to intelligence and patriotism regardless of\r\nthe sex of the possessor. Governor Saunders, in the capacity of\r\nUnited States Senator, cast a favorable ballot on measures in any\r\nmanner referring to woman's civil rights, and in 1882 spoke on the\r\nplatform of the National Association, at its Washington convention.\r\n\r\n[460] The legislature of 1875 repealed this law except so far as it\r\nreferred to unmarried adult women and widows. In the legislature of\r\n1881, Senator C. H. Gere introduced a bill revising the laws\r\nrelating to schools. One of the provisions of the bill conferred\r\nthe school ballot on women on the same terms as on men--viz: Any\r\nperson having children of school age, or having paid taxes on\r\npersonal property, or being assessed on real estate, within such a\r\nperiod, is entitled to vote at all elections pertaining to schools.\r\nThis, however, does not include the power to vote for State or\r\ncounty superintendents. The women of the State now vote so largely\r\nthat it is no longer a matter of comment or record.\r\n\r\n[461] The following named representatives voted \"yea\": Messrs.\r\nAhmanson, Cannon, Doone, Galey, Goodin, Hall, Jenkins, Kipp,\r\nMajors, Myers, Nims, Patterson, Porter, Quimby, Rhodes, Ryan,\r\nWickham, Riordan, Roberts--19. Voting \"nay\": Messrs. Briggs, Beall,\r\nE. Clark, J. Clark, Dillon, Duby, Grenell, Hudson, Munn, Overton,\r\nReed, Rosewater, Rouse, Schock, Shook, Sommerlad--16.\r\n\r\n[462] Voting in the affirmative: Messrs. Gerrard, Hascall, Kennedy,\r\nTucker, Tennant, and Mr. President--6. Voting in the negative:\r\nMessrs. Brown, Hawke, Hillon, Metz, Sheldon, and Thomas--6.\r\n\r\n[463] Voting \"yea\": Messrs. Ballard, Boyd, Campbell, Cassell,\r\nEstabrook, Gibbs, Gray, Hascall, Kenaston, Kilburn, Kirkpatrick,\r\nLake, Lyon, Majors, Mason, Manderson, Maxwell, Neligh, Newsome,\r\nPhilpott, Price, Robinson, Stewart, Spiece, Shaff, Thomas, Tisdel,\r\nTowle, Wakeley, President Strickland--30. Voting \"nay\": Messrs.\r\nAbbott, Eaton, Granger, Griggs, Moore, Myers, Parchin, Reynolds,\r\nSprague, Stevenson, Hummel, Vifquain, Weaver--13.\r\n\r\n[464] The gentlemen who advocated the measure most warmly, were\r\namong the ablest judges and jurists of the State. Of the\r\nopposition, Judge O. P. Mason experienced a change of heart, and\r\nten years later appeared as a foremost advocate. General E.\r\nEstabrook of Omaha lent all his influence to the amendment in the\r\nlate canvass, and Col. Philpott of Lincoln was also a warm\r\nadvocate, often accompanying his zealous wife and other members of\r\nthe effective and untiring Lincoln association to the school-house\r\nmeetings held in all parts of Lancaster county. D. T. Moore was\r\ncalled out at a meeting in York in 1881, and came forward without\r\nhesitation, saying that he was in favor of woman suffrage. He\r\nrelated this incident: that on his return home from the convention\r\nof 1871, he found that his wife had been looking after his stock\r\nfarm and attending to his business so that everything was in good\r\norder. He praised her highly, when she replied, \"Yes, and while I\r\nwas caring for your interests, you were voting against my rights.\"\r\nThe reply set him to thinking, and he thought himself over on the\r\nother side. A. J. Weaver opposed the clause in a very bitter\r\nspeech. The friends of the amendment in 1881 were given to\r\nunderstand that Mr. Weaver was friendly, but to prevent the\r\nforeigners having that opinion, Mr. Weaver translated the record of\r\nhis opposition into German, and distributed the papers among the\r\nGerman voters. Having been elected to congress, he was one of only\r\nthree Republican members who voted against the standing committee\r\non woman's claims. These facts cost him a great many votes at the\r\ntime of his reelection in 1884, and are not yet forgotten.\r\n\r\n[465] The debates of this convention were not reported for the\r\neconomical reasons mentioned. The names of the honored fifteen are,\r\nClinton Briggs, W. L. Dunlap, R. C. Eldridge, J. G. Ewan, C. H.\r\nFrady, C. H. Gere, R. B. Harrington, D. P. Henry, C. F. Manderson,\r\nJ. McPherson, M. B. Reese, S. M. Kirkpatrick, L. B. Thorne, A. M.\r\nWalling, J. F. Zediker. Many of these were active friends of the\r\namendment of 1881.\r\n\r\n[466] The officers elected were: _President_, Harriet S. Brooks,\r\nOmaha; _Vice-President-at-Large_, Clara Bewick Colby, Beatrice;\r\n_Vice-Presidents_--First Judicial District, Mrs. B. J. Thomson,\r\nHebron; Second, Mrs. E. L. Warner, Roca; Third, Mrs. A. P.\r\nNicholas, Omaha; Fourth, Mrs. J. S. Burns, Scribner; Fifth, Mrs. C.\r\nC. Chapin, Riverton; Sixth, Mrs. D. B. Slaughter, Fullerton;\r\n_Recording Secretary_, Mrs. Ada M. Bittenbender, Osceola;\r\n_Corresponding Secretary_, Mrs. Gertrude McDowell, Fairbury;\r\n_Treasurer_, Mrs. L. Russell, Tecumseh; _Executive Committee_, Rev.\r\nM. J. DeLong, Tecumseh; Mrs. Orpha C. Dinsmoor, Omaha; Mrs. J. C.\r\nRoberts, David City; Mrs. C. B. Parker, Mrs. J. B. Finch, Lincoln;\r\nMrs. E. M. Correll, Hebron; Mrs. J. H. Bowen, Hastings.\r\n\r\n[467] Members voting in the affirmative were: Messrs. Abbott,\r\nBabcock; Bailey, Baldwin, Bartlett, Broatch, Brown, Cantlin,\r\nCarman, Cook, Cole, Correll, Dailey, Dew, Dowty, Filley, Fried,\r\nGraham, Gray, Hall, Heacock, Herman, Hostetter, Howe, Jackson of\r\nPawnee, Jensen, Johnson, Jones, Kaley, Kempton, Kyner, Linn,\r\nMcClun, McDougall, McKinnon, Mickey, Moore of York, Montgomery,\r\nPalmer, Paxton, Ransom, Reed, Roberts, Root, Schick, Scott, Sill,\r\nSlocumb, Watts, Wilsey and Windham--51. Voting in the negative:\r\nMessrs. Bick, Bolln, Case, Franse, Frederick, Gates, Hollman,\r\nJackson of Douglas, King, Lamb, Laughlin, McShane, Moore of Otoe,\r\nMullen, Overton, Peterson, Putney, Sears, Wells, Whedon, Ziegler\r\nand Mr. Speaker--22.\r\n\r\n[468] At this time the valuable information from Wyoming with which\r\nNebraska was afterwards flooded; letters from Gov. Hoyt, editorials\r\nfrom leading papers of the territory, and testimony from every\r\nreputable source, had not been gathered; but two members of the\r\nHouse, J. H. Helm and Church Howe, had been residents of Wyoming,\r\nand these cheerfully gave their assurance that only good had\r\nresulted from the enfranchisement of the women of Wyoming.\r\n\r\n[469] Those voting in the affirmative were: Messrs. Baker, Burns\r\n(of Dodge), Burns (of York), Coon, Daily, Dinsmore, Doane, Evans,\r\nGere, Graham, Harrington, Morse, Perkins, Pierce, Powers, Smith,\r\nTefft, Turner, Van Wyck, Wells, Wherry and White--22. Those voting\r\nin the negative were: Messrs. Ballentine, Cady, Ervin, Howe, Myers,\r\nTaylor, Turk and Zehrung--8. Two of these names cannot stand in the\r\nroll of honor without an explanation; for twenty votes indicate the\r\nfull strength of the bill. The irrelevance of opponents was\r\nillustrated by Senators Morse and Pierce. The former in voting\r\nsaid, he had opposed the measure every step of the way, and now to\r\nbe consistent he voted aye. Senator Pierce said he had been\r\nwatching the other side of the capitol and nothing there seemed\r\npopular but whiskey and women, therefore, he voted aye!\r\n\r\n[470] The speakers of this convention were Clara Bewick Colby,\r\nacting president; Mr. Sattler, who gave the welcome; Ada M.\r\nBittenbender, Esther L. Warner, Judge I. N. Taylor, Mrs. M. E.\r\nVandermark, Rev. Haywood and Professor Wood of Nebraska City\r\nCollege. The latter spoke in English in the afternoon, and in\r\nGerman, his native tongue, in the evening. The announcement that he\r\nwould do so drew a large number of his countrymen. One of these was\r\nallowed the floor by request, when he soundly berated (in German)\r\nthe women as opposed to foreigners, while at the same time he tried\r\nto weaken Professor Wood's argument by saying it was to be\r\nattributed to an American wife. It was reported that the marked\r\ncontrast between the speakers was commented on by resident Germans\r\ngreatly to the disadvantage of their fellow-townsman.\r\n\r\n[471] The officers elected were: _President_, Ada M. Bittenbender;\r\n_Vice-President_, Clara Bewick Colby; _Secretary_, Belle G.\r\nBigelow; _Corresponding Secretary_, Gertrude M. McDowell;\r\n_Treasurer_, Lucinda Russell; _Executive Committee_, Harriet S.\r\nBrooks, E. M. Correll, Susie Noble Fifield, George B. Skinner, Rev.\r\nJohn McNamara, Jennie F. Holmes; _Vice-Presidents of Judicial\r\nDistricts_--First, Barbara J. Thompson; second, Dr. Ruth M. Wood;\r\nthird, Orpha Clement Dinsmoor; fourth, Ada Van Pelt; fifth, Mrs. H.\r\nS. Sydenham.\r\n\r\n[472] Most of the speakers spent several weeks in the State. Mrs.\r\nHelen M. Gougar, Mrs. May Wright Sewall, Mrs. Saxon, Mrs. Blake,\r\nMrs. Harbert, Mrs. Shattuck, Mrs. Neyman, Miss Anthony, Miss\r\nCouzins and Miss Hindman were the principal National speakers, and\r\ntheir ability and zeal aroused the whole State. Mrs. Colby was\r\nindefatigable in her exertions from the moment the amendment was\r\nsubmitted to the end of the canvass.

This has been the experience of\r\nthe friends in every State where the proposition has been\r\nsubmitted to a vote of the electors--alike in Michigan, Colorado,\r\nNebraska and Oregon--offering so many arguments in favor of the\r\nenfranchisement of woman by a simple act of the legislature, where\r\nthe real power of the people is primarily represented. We have so\r\nmany instances on record of the exercise of this power by the\r\nlegislatures of the several States in the regulation of the\r\nsuffrage, that there can be no doubt that the sole responsibility\r\nin securing this right to the women of a State rests with the\r\nlegislature, or with congress in passing a sixteenth amendment that\r\nshould override all State action in protecting the rights of United\r\nStates citizens.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Anna C. Wait for most of the interesting facts\r\nof this chapter. She writes:\r\n\r\n     I watched with intense interest from my home in Ohio, the\r\n     progress of the woman suffrage idea in Kansas in the campaign of\r\n     1867, and although temporary defeat was the result, yet the moral\r\n     grandeur displayed by the people in seeking to make their\r\n     constitution an embodiment of the principle of American liberty,\r\n     decided me to become a citizen of that young and beautiful State.\r\n     Gov. Harvey's message was at that time attracting much attention\r\n     and varied comments by the press. For the benefit of those who\r\n     have not studied the whole history of the cause, we give the\r\n     following extracts from his message, published February 9, 1871:\r\n\r\n          The tendency of this age is towards a civil policy wherein\r\n          political rights will not be affected by social or\r\n          ethnological distinctions; and from the moral nature of\r\n          mankind and the experience of States, we may infer that\r\n          restrictions merely arbitrary and conventional, like those\r\n          based upon color and sex, cannot last much longer than they\r\n          are desired, and cannot be removed much sooner than they\r\n          should be. This consideration should give patience to the\r\n          reformer, and resignation to the conservative.\r\n\r\n          Let us have a true republic--a \"government of the people, by\r\n          the people, for the people,\" and we shall hear no more the\r\n          oligarchical cry of croaking conservatism calling for a\r\n          \"white man's government\"--appealing by this, and like\r\n          slogans of class and caste to the lowest and meanest\r\n          principles of human nature, dangerous alike to real\r\n          republicanism and true democracy. Expediency, that great\r\n          pretext for the infringement of human rights, no longer\r\n          justifies us in the retention of a monopoly of political\r\n          power in our own favored class of \"white male citizens.\"\r\n\r\n     In the summer of 1871, Mr. Wait and myself removed to Salina,\r\n     where Mrs. Hannah Wilson resided. She was the only person in this\r\n     section of Kansas I ever heard of doing any suffrage work between\r\n     the years of 1867 and 1877. She was a woman of great force of\r\n     character, and a strong advocate of suffrage. She was born in\r\n     Hamilton county, Ohio, and came to Salina in 1870. After Miss\r\n     Anthony lectured in that city in 1877, Mrs. Wilson circulated\r\n     petitions to the legislature and to congress. She was also active\r\n     and aggressive in the temperance cause. When she learned of the\r\n     Lincoln _Beacon_, and its advocacy of woman suffrage, she wrote\r\n     an article for the paper, and accompanied it with a kind letter\r\n     and the price of a year's subscription. Mrs. Wilson was a Quaker,\r\n     and in her dress and address strictly adhered to the peculiarites\r\n     of that sect.\r\n\r\n     Miss Kate Stephens, professor of Greek in the Kansas State\r\n     University, writes that she has made diligent search during the\r\n     past summer among the libraries of Topeka and Lawrence for record\r\n     of suffrage work since the campaign of 1867, and finds absolutely\r\n     nothing, so that I am reduced to the necessity of writing,\r\n     principally, of our little efforts here in central Kansas. In the\r\n     intensely interesting letters of Mesdames Helen Ekin Starrett,\r\n     Susan E. Wattles, Dr. R. S. Tenney and Hon. J. P. Root, in Vol.\r\n     II., all written since 1880, I find no mention of any woman\r\n     suffrage organizations. Mrs. Wattles, of Mound City, says: \"My\r\n     work has been very limited. I have only been able to circulate\r\n     tracts and papers\"; and she enumerates all the woman suffrage\r\n     papers ever published in America, which she had taken and given\r\n     away. A quiet, unobtrusive method of work, but one of the most\r\n     effective; and doubtless to the sentiment created and fostered by\r\n     this sowing of suffrage literature by Mrs. Wattles, is largely\r\n     due the wonderful revival which has swept like one of our own\r\n     prairie fires over south-eastern Kansas during the past year; a\r\n     sentiment so strong as to need but \"a live coal from off the\r\n     altar\" to kindle into a blaze of enthusiasm. This it received in\r\n     the earnest eloquence of Mrs. Helen M. Gougar, who has twice\r\n     visited that portion of the State. All these writers express\r\n     their faith in a growing interest in the suffrage cause, and,\r\n     some of them, the belief that if the question were again\r\n     submitted to a vote of the people, it would carry.\r\n\r\n     In our State suffrage convention, June, 1884, among the demands\r\n     which we resolved to make of our incoming legislature, was the\r\n     submission of an amendment striking out the word \"male\" from the\r\n     State constitution. For myself, I entertained no hope that it\r\n     would succeed further than as a means of agitation and education.\r\n     On reflection, I hope it will not be done. The women of Kansas\r\n     have once been subjected to the humiliation of having their\r\n     political disabilities perpetuated by the vote of the \"rank and\r\n     file\" of our populace. While I believe the growth of popular\r\n     opinion in favor of equality of rights for women has nowhere been\r\n     more rapid than in Kansas, yet I do not lose sight of the fact\r\n     that thousands of foreigners are each year added to the voting\r\n     population, whose ballots in the aggregate defeat the will of our\r\n     enlightened, American-born citizens. Besides, it is a too\r\n     convenient way for a legislature to shirk its own responsibility.\r\n     If the demand is made, I hope it may be done in connection with\r\n     that for municipal and presidential suffrage.\r\n\r\n     The history of the woman suffrage organizations in Kansas since\r\n     1867, may be briefly told. The first owes its existence to one\r\n     copy of the _National Citizen and Ballot-Box_ subscribed for by\r\n     my husband, W. S. Wait, who by the merest chance heard Miss\r\n     Anthony deliver her famous lecture, \"Woman wants Bread, not the\r\n     Ballot,\" in Salina, in November, 1877. The paper was religiously\r\n     read by Mrs. Emily J. Biggs and myself; although we did not need\r\n     conversion, both being radical in our ideas on this question, we\r\n     had long felt the need of something being done which would fix\r\n     public attention and provoke discussion. This was all we felt\r\n     ourselves competent to do, and the knowledge that nobody else in\r\n     our section of the country would do it, coupled with the\r\n     inspiration of the _National Citizen_, culminated, in November\r\n     1879, in sending to the _Saline Valley Register_, George W.\r\n     Anderson, editor and proprietor, a notice for a meeting of women\r\n     for the purpose of organizing a suffrage society. In response to\r\n     the call, Mrs. Emily J. Biggs, Mrs. Sarah E. Lutes, and Mrs.\r\n     Wait, met November 11, 1879, at the house of A. T. Biggs, and\r\n     organized the Lincoln Auxiliary of the National Association. We\r\n     elected a full corps of officers from among ladies whom we\r\n     believed to be favorable, interviewed them for their approval,\r\n     and sent a full report of the meeting to be published as a matter\r\n     of news in the _Register_, which had given our call without\r\n     comment. The editor had a few weeks previously bought the paper,\r\n     and we were totally ignorant in regard to his position upon the\r\n     question. We were not long left in doubt, for the fact that we\r\n     had actually organized in a way which showed that we understood\r\n     ourselves, and meant business, had the effect to elicit from his\r\n     pen a scurrilous article, in which he called us \"the three\r\n     noble-hearted women,\" classed us with \"free-lovers,\" called us\r\n     \"monstrosities, neither men nor women,\" and more of the same\r\n     sort. Of course, the effect of this upon the community was to\r\n     array all true friends of the cause on our side, to bring the\r\n     opposition, made bold by the championship of such a gallant\r\n     leader, to the front, and cause the faint-hearted to take to the\r\n     fence. And here we had the discussion opened up in a manner\r\n     which, had we foreseen, I fear our courage would have been\r\n     inadequate to the demand. But not for one moment did we entertain\r\n     a thought of retreating. Knowing that if we maintained silence,\r\n     the enemy would consider us vanquished, I wrote an article for\r\n     his paper, quoting largely from Walker's American Law, which he\r\n     published; and Mrs. Biggs also furnished him an article in which\r\n     she showed him up in a manner so ludicrous and sarcastic that he\r\n     got rid of printing it by setting it up full of mistakes which he\r\n     manufactured himself, and sending her the proof with the\r\n     information that if he published it at all, it would be in that\r\n     form. It appeared the following week, however, in the first\r\n     number of _The Argus_, a Democratic paper, Ira C. Lutes, editor\r\n     and proprietor, in which we at once secured a column for the use\r\n     of our society. About a dozen ladies attended our second meeting,\r\n     at which the following resolutions were unanimously adopted, all\r\n     the ladies present being allowed to vote:\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, The local newspaper is adjudged, by common consent,\r\n          to be the exponent of the intelligence, refinement, and\r\n          culture of a community, and, in a large degree, the educator\r\n          of the rising generation; and\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, In one issue of the Lincoln _Register_ there\r\n          appears no fewer than forty-seven misspelled words, with\r\n          numerous errors in grammatical construction and punctuation;\r\n          also a scurrilous article headed \"Woman vs. Man,\" in which\r\n          the editor not only grossly misrepresents us, but assails\r\n          the characters of all advocates of suffrage everywhere in a\r\n          manner which shocks the moral sense of every true lady and\r\n          gentleman in this community; therefore\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That this association present the editor of the\r\n          _Register_ with a copy of some standard English\r\n          spelling-book, and English Language Lessons, for his\r\n          especial use.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That as he has been so kind as to offer his\r\n          advice to us, unsolicited, we reciprocate the favor by\r\n          admonishing him to confine himself to facts in future, and\r\n          to remember that the people of Lincoln are capable of\r\n          appreciating truth and common decency.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That a copy of these resolutions be furnished\r\n          the editor of the Lincoln _Register_, with the books above\r\n          named.\r\n\r\n     This was promptly done, and so enraged him that the following\r\n     week he published a tirade of abuse consisting of brazen\r\n     falsehoods, whereupon a gentleman called a halt, by faithfully\r\n     promising to chastise him if he did not desist, which had the\r\n     desired effect so far as his paper was concerned.\r\n\r\n     W. S. Wait bought the _Argus_ at the end of four months, changed\r\n     its politics to Republican, and its name to the Lincoln _Beacon_,\r\n     in which I established a woman suffrage department, under the\r\n     head of \"Woman as a Citizen,\" with one of Lucretia Mott's\r\n     favorite mottoes, \"Truth for Authority, and not Authority for\r\n     Truth\"; and weekly, for six years, it has gone to a constantly\r\n     increasing circle of readers, and contributed its share to\r\n     whatever strength and influence the cause has gained in this\r\n     portion of the State. In the summer of 1880, G. W. Anderson\r\n     announced himself a candidate for the legislature. He had just\r\n     before made himself especially obnoxious by shockingly indecent\r\n     remarks about the ladies who had participated in the exercises of\r\n     the Fourth of July celebration. At a meeting of the suffrage\r\n     society, held August 6, the following resolution, suggested by\r\n     Mrs. S. E. Lutes, were unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, We, as responsible members of society, and\r\n          guardians of the purity of our families and community, are\r\n          actuated by a sense of duty and our accountability to God\r\n          for the faithful performance of it; and\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, George W. Anderson, editor and proprietor of the\r\n          Lincoln _Register_, during his few months' residence in our\r\n          county has, by constant calumny and scurrility, both verbal\r\n          and through the columns of his paper, sought to injure the\r\n          reputation of the honorable women who compose the Lincoln\r\n          suffrage and temperance associations, and of all women\r\n          everywhere who sympathize with the aims and purposes which\r\n          these societies represent; and\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, His utterances through the columns of the Lincoln\r\n          _Register_ are often unfit to be read by any child, or aloud\r\n          in any family, because of their indecency, we are\r\n          unanimously of the opinion that his course is calculated to\r\n          defeat the aims and purposes of Christianity, temperance and\r\n          morality; therefore\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That whenever George W. Anderson aspires to any\r\n          position of honor, trust or emolument in the gift of the\r\n          voters of Lincoln county, we will use all honorable means in\r\n          our power to defeat him; and we further urge upon every\r\n          woman who has the welfare of our county at heart, the duty\r\n          and necessity of cooeperating with us to accomplish this end.\r\n\r\n     The above preamble and resolution appeared in the woman's column\r\n     of the Lincoln _Beacon_ the following week, and 250 copies were\r\n     printed in the form of hand-bills and distributed to the\r\n     twenty-three post-offices in Lincoln county. It did not prevent\r\n     his election, and we did not expect it would, but we believed it\r\n     our duty to enter our protest against the perpetration of this\r\n     outrage upon the moral sense of those who knew him best. We\r\n     ignored him in the legislature, sending our petitions asking that\r\n     body to recommend to congress the adoption of the sixteenth\r\n     amendment, to Hon. S. C. Millington of Crawford, who had come to\r\n     our notice that winter by offering a woman suffrage resolution in\r\n     the House. In 1882 Anderson sought a second indorsement as a\r\n     candidate for the legislature, but that portion of the community\r\n     which he really represented had become disgusted with him; he\r\n     struggled against fate with constantly waning patronage for\r\n     another year, when he succumbed to the inevitable and sought a\r\n     new field, a wiser if a sadder man. His mantle has fallen upon E.\r\n     S. Bower, whose capacity and style were graphically portrayed in\r\n     caustic rhyme by Mrs. Ellsworth, making him the target for the\r\n     wit of the women long after.\r\n\r\n     I have given more space and prominence to these two editors than\r\n     they merit, but the influence of a local newspaper is not to be\r\n     despised, however despicable the editor and his paper may be; and\r\n     it takes no small degree of courage to face such an influence as\r\n     that exerted in this county by the one in question, which, I am\r\n     happy to say, has gradually dwindled, until to-day it is too\r\n     trifling, both in extent and character, to deserve recognition.\r\n\r\n     Six years ago I do not believe there was a paper in the State of\r\n     Kansas which contained a woman suffrage department, and we rarely\r\n     saw any reference whatever to the subject; now, within a radius\r\n     of fifty miles of Lincoln Centre, fully two-thirds of all\r\n     newspapers published have a column devoted to suffrage or\r\n     temperance, or both, edited by women. The reason this is not true\r\n     of the press of the entire State is because our indefatigable\r\n     corresponding secretary, Mrs. Bertha H. Ellsworth, has not yet\r\n     had sufficient time to personally present the matter; but there\r\n     has been such a growth on the subject that by the press generally\r\n     it seems to be accepted as one of the living issues of the day. A\r\n     very efficient agency in bringing about this desirable result was\r\n     the printed column, entitled \"Concerning Women,\" sent out gratis\r\n     every week during the year 1882, by Mrs. Lucy Stone, from the\r\n     office of _The Woman's Journal_, to all newspapers that would\r\n     publish it. Many Kansas editors availed themselves of this\r\n     generous offer, greatly to the advantage of their patrons and\r\n     themselves.\r\n\r\n     But to return to the Lincoln Woman Suffrage Association. The\r\n     first year our membership increased to twenty-seven; the second,\r\n     to forty, including six gentlemen. We did not invite gentlemen to\r\n     join the first year; owing to the character and attitude of the\r\n     opposition, we preferred to demonstrate our ability to conduct\r\n     the affairs of the society without masculine assistance. During\r\n     our six years' existence we have enrolled eighty members,\r\n     eighteen of whom are gentlemen. Of this number, forty-five women\r\n     and fourteen men still reside in Lincoln county. We have held, on\r\n     an average, one parlor meeting a month and ten public meetings.\r\n\r\n     In 1880, Mesdames Emily J. Biggs, Mary Crawford, Bertha H.\r\n     Ellsworth and myself were assigned places on the programme for\r\n     the Fourth of July celebration, after solicitation by a committee\r\n     from our society. To me was assigned the reading of the\r\n     Declaration of Independence, and I embraced the opportunity of\r\n     interspersing a few remarks not found in that honored document,\r\n     to the delight of our friends and the disgust of our foes. The\r\n     other ladies all made original, excellent and well-timed\r\n     addresses. In 1881 we got up the Fourth of July celebration[475]\r\n     ourselves, and gave the men half the programme without their\r\n     asking for it. In 1883 we had a \"Foremothers' Day\" celebration,\r\n     and confined the programme to our own society. In September,\r\n     1882, the society sent the writer as delegate to the annual\r\n     meeting of the National Woman Suffrage Association, held at\r\n     Omaha, Nebraska; and in March, 1884, we sent Bertha H. Ellsworth\r\n     to the Washington convention in the same capacity. Our society\r\n     has taken an active part in the annual school district elections\r\n     in Lincoln Centre. In the last five elections we have been twice\r\n     defeated and three times successful. Our defeats we claimed as\r\n     victories, inasmuch as we forced our opponents to bring out all\r\n     their friends to outvote us. Fifty per cent. of all the votes\r\n     cast at the last three elections were by women. Only twelve women\r\n     in the town failed to vote in 1884. This increase is general all\r\n     over the State; and, although we have only once tried in Lincoln\r\n     Centre to elect a woman, and then failed, yet very many of the\r\n     country districts have one, some two women on the school-board,\r\n     and at one time all three members in one district were women.\r\n     That they are honest, capable and efficient is the verdict in\r\n     every case.\r\n\r\n     In the spring of 1881, Mrs. Emily J. Biggs organized the Stanton\r\n     Suffrage Society, eight miles from Lincoln Centre, with a\r\n     membership of over twenty, more than half of whom were gentlemen.\r\n     Mesdames Mary Baldwin, N. Good, T. Faulkner, M. Biggs, Mrs. Swank\r\n     and others were the leading spirits. All their meetings are\r\n     public, and are held in the school-house. Through this society\r\n     that portion of the county has become well leavened with suffrage\r\n     sentiment. Failing health alone has prevented Mrs. Biggs from\r\n     carrying this school district organization to all parts of the\r\n     county and beyond its limits, as she has been urgently invited to\r\n     do. \"Instant in season and out of season\" with a word for the\r\n     cause, she has, individually, reached more people with the\r\n     subject than any other half-dozen women in the society. Her pen,\r\n     too, has done good service. Over the _nom de plume_ of \"Nancy,\"\r\n     in the _Beacon_, she has dealt telling blows to our ancient\r\n     adversary, the _Register_. In October, 1882, the writer went by\r\n     invitation to Ellsworth and organized a society[476] auxiliary to\r\n     the National, composed of excellent material, but too timid to do\r\n     more than hold its own until the summer of 1884, when Mrs.\r\n     Gougar, and later, Mrs. Colby, lectured there, soon after which\r\n     Mrs. Ellsworth canvassed the town with literature and a petition\r\n     for municipal suffrage, which was signed by eighty of the\r\n     eighty-five women to whom it was presented, showing that there\r\n     was either a great deal of original suffrage sentiment there, or\r\n     that the society had exerted a large amount of \"silent\r\n     influence.\" In October, 1883, Mrs. Helen M. Gougar came to fill\r\n     some lecture engagements in the southeastern part of the State.\r\n     During this visit she organized several clubs.[477]\r\n\r\n     In June, 1884, Mrs. Gougar again visited Kansas, lecturing for a\r\n     month in different parts of the State. She drew large audiences\r\n     and made many converts. A suffrage society was organized at\r\n     Emporia, Miss M. J. Watson, president. The active friends availed\r\n     themselves of her assistance to call a State Suffrage Convention,\r\n     which met in the Senate chamber in Topeka, June 25, 26, and\r\n     organized a State Association.[478] Mrs. Gougar, by the unanimous\r\n     vote of the convention, presided, and dispatched business with\r\n     her characteristic ability. In view of all the circumstances,\r\n     this convention and its results were highly satisfactory. The\r\n     attendance was not large, but the fact that the call was issued\r\n     from Topeka to the press of the State but eight days before the\r\n     convention met, and probably did not reach half the papers in\r\n     time for one insertion, accounts for the absence of a crowd. Some\r\n     even in Topeka learned that the convention was in progress barely\r\n     in time to reach its last session. Reporters for the Topeka\r\n     _Capital_, the Topeka _Commonwealth_ and Kansas City _Journal_\r\n     attended all the day sessions of the convention, and gave full\r\n     and fair reports of the proceedings. After the adjournment of the\r\n     State convention, the women of Topeka formed a city society. The\r\n     corresponding secretary, Mrs. Ellsworth, with Mrs. Clara B.\r\n     Colby, made an extensive circuit, lecturing and organizing\r\n     societies. They were everywhere cordially welcomed.[479]\r\n\r\n     Kansas has a flourishing Women's Christian Temperance Union which\r\n     at its last annual meeting adopted a strong woman suffrage\r\n     resolution; Miss O. P. Bray of Topeka is its superintendent of\r\n     franchise. Mrs. Emma Molloy of Washington, both upon the rostrum\r\n     and through her paper, the official organ of the State Union,\r\n     ably and fearlessly advocates woman suffrage as well as\r\n     prohibition, and makes as many converts to the former as to the\r\n     latter.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. A. G. Lord did a work worthy of mention in the formation of\r\n     the Radical Reform Christian Association, for young men and boys,\r\n     taking their pledge to neither swear, use tobacco nor drink\r\n     intoxicating liquors. A friend says of Mrs. Lord:\r\n\r\n          Like all true reformers she has met even more than the usual\r\n          share of opposition and persecution, and mostly because she\r\n          is a woman and a licensed preacher of the Methodist church\r\n          in Kansas. She was a preacher for three years, but refuses\r\n          to be any longer because, she says, under the discipline as\r\n          it now is, the church has no right to license a woman to\r\n          preach. Trying to do her work inside the church in which she\r\n          was born and reared, she has had to combat not only the\r\n          powers of darkness outside the church, but also the most\r\n          contemptible opposition, amounting in several instances to\r\n          bitter persecutions, from the ministers of her own\r\n          denomination with whom she has been associated in her work\r\n          as a preacher; and through it all she has toiled on,\r\n          manifesting only the most patient, forgiving spirit, and the\r\n          broadest, most Christ-like charity.\r\n\r\n     The R. R. C. A. has been in existence two and a half years, and\r\n     has already many hundreds of members in this and adjoining\r\n     counties, through the indefatigable zeal of its founder. Mitchell\r\n     county has the honor of numbering among its many enterprising\r\n     women the only woman who is a mail contractor in the United\r\n     States, Mrs. Myra Peterson, a native of New Hampshire. The\r\n     _Woman's Tribune_ of November, 1884, contains the following brief\r\n     sketch of a grand historic character:\r\n\r\n          Marianna T. Folsom is lecturing in Kansas on woman suffrage.\r\n          She gives an interesting account of a visit to Mrs. Prudence\r\n          Crandall Philleo. Miss Crandall over fifty years ago\r\n          allowed a girl with colored blood in her veins to attend her\r\n          young ladies' school in Connecticut. On account of the\r\n          social disturbance because of this, she dismissed the white\r\n          girls and made her school one for colored pupils. Protests\r\n          were followed by indictments, and these by mobbings, until\r\n          she was obliged to give up her school. For her fortitude,\r\n          the Anti-Slavery Society had her portrait painted. It became\r\n          the property of Rev. Samuel J. May, who donated it to\r\n          Cornell University when opened to women. Miss Crandall\r\n          married, but has now been a widow many years. She is in her\r\n          eighty-third year, and is vigorous in mind and body, having\r\n          been able to deliver the last Fourth of July oration at Elk\r\n          Falls, Kan., where she now lives and advocates woman\r\n          suffrage and temperance.\r\n\r\n     In the introduction to Chapter VII., Vol. I., of this history,\r\n     appears this sentence: \"To Clarina Howard Nichols[480] the women\r\n     of Kansas are indebted for many civil rights which they have as\r\n     yet been too apathetic to exercise.\" Uncomplimentary as this\r\n     statement is, I must admit its truthfulness as applied to a large\r\n     majority of our women of culture and leisure, those who should\r\n     have availed themselves of the privileges already theirs and\r\n     labored for what the devotion of Mrs. Nichols made attainable.\r\n     They have neither done this, nor tried to enlighten their less\r\n     favored sisters throughout the State, the great mass of whom are\r\n     obliged to exert every energy of body and mind to furnish food,\r\n     clothes and shelter for themselves and children. Probably fully\r\n     four-fifths of the women of Kansas never have heard of Clarina\r\n     Howard Nichols; while a much larger number do know that our laws\r\n     favor women more than those of other States, and largely avail\r\n     themselves of the school ballot. The readiness with which the\r\n     rank and file of our women assent to the truth when it is\r\n     presented to them, indicates that their inaction results not so\r\n     much from apathy and indifference as from a lack of means and\r\n     opportunity. Among all the members of all the woman suffrage\r\n     societies in Central Kansas, I know of but just one woman of\r\n     leisure--one who is not obliged to make a personal sacrifice of\r\n     some kind each time she attends a meeting or pays a dollar into\r\n     the treasury. Section 6, Article XV., of the constitution of\r\n     Kansas reads:\r\n\r\n          The legislature shall provide for the protection of the\r\n          rights of women, in acquiring and possessing property, real,\r\n          personal, and mixed, separate and apart from her husband;\r\n          and shall also provide for their equal rights in the\r\n          possession of their children. In accordance with the true\r\n          spirit of this section, our statute provides that the law of\r\n          descents and distributions as regards the property of either\r\n          husband or wife is the same; and the interests of one in the\r\n          property of the other are the same with each; and that the\r\n          common-law principles of estates of dower, and by courtesy\r\n          are abolished.[481]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"The world needs women who do their own thinking.\r\nCordially yours, Helen M. Gougar\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n     The rights of husband and wife in the control of their respective\r\n     properties, both real and personal, are identical, as provided\r\n     for in sections 1, 2, 3, and 4. Chapter 62, page 539, compiled\r\n     laws of Kansas, 1878:\r\n\r\n          SECTION 1. The property, real and personal, which any woman\r\n          in this State may own at the time of her marriage, and the\r\n          rents, issues, profits, and proceeds thereof, and any real,\r\n          personal, or mixed property which shall come to her by\r\n          descent, devise, or bequest, or the gift of any person\r\n          except her husband, shall remain her sole and separate\r\n          property, notwithstanding her marriage, and not be subject\r\n          to the disposal of her husband, or liable for his debts.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 2. A married woman, while the marriage relation\r\n          subsists, may bargain, sell and convey her real and personal\r\n          property, and enter into any contract with reference to the\r\n          same, in the same manner, to the same extent, and with like\r\n          effect as a married man may in relation to his real and\r\n          personal property.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 3. A woman may, while married, sue and be sued, in the\r\n          same manner as if unmarried.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 4. Any married woman may carry on any trade or\r\n          business, and perform any labor or services, on her sole and\r\n          separate account, and the earnings of any married woman from\r\n          her trade, business, labor or services, shall be her sole\r\n          and separate property, and may be used and invested by her\r\n          in her own name.\r\n\r\n     It is a fact worthy of note that the above legislation, also the\r\n     passage of the law of descents and distributions, immediately\r\n     followed the woman suffrage campaign of 1867.\r\n\r\n     In 1880, the Democrats of Kansas, in their State convention at\r\n     Topeka, nominated Miss Sarah A. Brown of Douglas county, for\r\n     superintendent of public instruction, the first instance on\r\n     record of a woman receiving a nomination from one of the leading\r\n     political parties for a State office. The following is Miss\r\n     Brown's letter of acceptance:\r\n\r\n          OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, Douglas    }\r\n                                                         Co., Kansas,}\r\n                                   LAWRENCE, Kansas, Sept. 30, 1880. }\r\n\r\n          _To Hon. John Martin, Topeka, Kansas, Chairman of the State\r\n          Democratic Central Committee:_\r\n\r\n          SIR:--I am in receipt of your communication of August 30,\r\n          advising me of the action of the Democratic convention of\r\n          August 26, in nominating me as their candidate for State\r\n          superintendent of public instruction.\r\n\r\n          In making this nomination the Democratic party of Kansas\r\n          has, with a liberal and enlightened spirit, and with a\r\n          generous purpose, yielded to the tendency of the times,\r\n          which demand equal rights and equal opportunities for all\r\n          the people, and it has thus shown itself to be a party of\r\n          progress. It has placed itself squarely and unequivocally\r\n          before the people upon this great and vital question of\r\n          giving to woman the right to work in any field for which she\r\n          may be fitted, thus placing our young and glorious State in\r\n          the foremost rank on this, as on the other questions of\r\n          reform.\r\n\r\n          Furthermore, in nominating one who has no vote, and for this\r\n          reason cannot be considered in politics, and in doing this\r\n          of its own free will, without any solicitation on my part,\r\n          the Democratic party of this State has shown that it is in\r\n          full accord with the Jeffersonian doctrine that the office\r\n          should seek the man and not the man the office; and also\r\n          that it fully appreciates the fact which is conceded by all\r\n          persons who have thought much on educational matters, that\r\n          the best interests of our schools demand that the office of\r\n          superintendent, both of the State and county, should be as\r\n          far as possible disconnected from politics, and it has done\r\n          what it could to rescue the office from the vortex of mere\r\n          partisan strife. For this reason I accept the nomination,\r\n          thanking the party for the honor it has conferred upon me.\r\n\r\n                                Respectfully,          SARAH A. BROWN.\r\n\r\n     Miss Brown was defeated. The vote of the State showed the average\r\n     Democrat unable to overcome his time-rusted prejudices\r\n     sufficiently to vote for a woman to fill the highest educational\r\n     office in the gift of the people, so that Miss Brown's minority\r\n     was smaller even than that of the regular Democratic ticket.\r\n\r\n     January 21, 1881, Hon. S. C. Millington of Crawford county\r\n     introduced in the House a joint resolution providing for the\r\n     submission to the legal voters of the State of Kansas of a\r\n     proposition to amend the constitution so as to admit of female\r\n     suffrage. The vote on the adoption of the resolution stood 51\r\n     ayes and 31 noes in the House, and a tie in the Senate. Later in\r\n     the same session, Hon. A. C. Pierce of Davis county introduced in\r\n     the House a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the\r\n     constitution which should confer the right of suffrage on any one\r\n     over 21 years of age who had resided in the State six months. Mr.\r\n     Hackney of Cowley county, introduced a like resolution in the\r\n     Senate.\r\n\r\n     In December, 1881, Governor St. John appointed Mrs. Cora M. Downs\r\n     one of the regents of the State University at Lawrence. In 1873,\r\n     Mrs. Rice was elected to the office of county clerk of Harper\r\n     county, and Miss Alice Junken to the office of recorder of deeds,\r\n     in Davis county. In 1885 Miss Junken was reelected by a majority\r\n     of 500 over her competitor, Mrs. Fleming, while Trego county gave\r\n     a unanimous vote for Miss Ada Clift as register of deeds.\r\n\r\n     In proportion to her population Kansas has as many women in the\r\n     professions as any of the older States. We have lawyers,\r\n     physicians, preachers and editors, and the number is constantly\r\n     increasing. In Topeka there are eight practicing physicians,\r\n     holding diplomas from medical colleges, and two or three who are\r\n     not graduates. In the Woman's Medical College of Chicago, Kansas\r\n     now has four representatives--Mrs. Sallie A. Goff of Lincoln,\r\n     Miss Thomas of Olathe, Miss Cunningham of Garnett, and Miss\r\n     Gilman of Pittsburg.\r\n\r\n     All female persons over the age of twenty-one years are entitled\r\n     to vote at any school-district meeting on the same terms as men.\r\n\r\n     The right of a woman to hold any office, State (except member of\r\n     the legislature), county, township or school-district, in the\r\n     State of Kansas, is the same as that of a man. In 1882, six\r\n     counties, viz., Chase, Cherokee, Greenwood, Labette, Pawnee, and\r\n     Woodson, elected women as superintendents of public instruction.\r\n\r\n          Section 23, Article II., Constitution of Kansas, reads: \"The\r\n          legislature, in providing for the formation and regulation\r\n          of schools, shall make no distinction between males and\r\n          females.\"\r\n\r\n     Under the legislation based upon this clause of our constitution,\r\n     males and females have equal privileges in all schools controlled\r\n     by the State. The latest report of the State superintendent of\r\n     public instruction shows that over one-half of the pupils of the\r\n     Normal school, about two-fifths in the University, and nearly\r\n     one-third in the Agricultural College, are females.\r\n\r\n     In the private institutions of learning, including both\r\n     denominational and unsectarian, over one-half of the students are\r\n     females who study in the same classes as the males, except in\r\n     Washburn college which has a separate course for ladies.\r\n\r\n     Most of these institutions have one woman, or more, in their\r\n     faculties. One-half of the faculty of the State University is\r\n     composed of women. In the last report of the State superintendent\r\n     is the following:\r\n\r\n          The ratio of female teachers is greater than ever before,\r\n          some 69 per cent. of the entire number employed. It is,\r\n          indeed, a matter of congratulation that the work of the\r\n          schools, especially the primary teaching, is falling more\r\n          and more to the care of women.\r\n\r\n     The Republican State convention of 1882, by an overwhelming\r\n     majority endorsed woman suffrage, which action the Lincoln W. S.\r\n     A. promptly recognized as follows:\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, The Republican party of the State of Kansas, by and\r\n          through its chosen representatives in the Republican State\r\n          convention at Topeka, August 9, 1882, did, by an\r\n          overwhelming majority, pledge itself to the support of the\r\n          principle of woman suffrage by the following:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That we request the next legislature to submit\r\n          such an amendment to the constitution of the State as will\r\n          secure to woman the right of suffrage. And,\r\n\r\n          WHEREAS, By this action the Republican party of Kansas has\r\n          placed itself in line with the advanced thought of the times\r\n          in a manner worthy a great political party of the last\r\n          quarter of the nineteenth century, thereby proving itself\r\n          worthy the respect and confidence of the women of the State;\r\n          therefore,\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the Lincoln Woman Suffrage Association, in\r\n          behalf of the women of Kansas, does hereby express thanks to\r\n          the Republican party for this recognition of the political\r\n          rights of the women of the State, and especially to the Hon.\r\n          J. C. Root of Wyandotte, Hon. Hackney of Winfield, Col.\r\n          Graves of Montgomery, and Gen. Kelly, for their able and\r\n          fearless support of the measure, and to each and every\r\n          member of the convention who voted for it.\r\n\r\n     In 1883, Senator Hackney introduced a bill of which we find the\r\n     following in the _Topeka Capital_ of that date:\r\n\r\n          Senate bill No. 46, being Senator Hackney's, an act to\r\n          provide for the submission of the question of female\r\n          suffrage to the women of Kansas, was taken up, the reading\r\n          thereof being greeted with applause. It provides that at the\r\n          general election in 1883 the women of the State shall\r\n          decide, by ballot, whether they want suffrage or not.\r\n          Senator Hackney made an address to the Senate upon the bill,\r\n          saying he believed in giving women the same rights as men\r\n          had. The last Republican platform declared in favor of woman\r\n          suffrage, and those Republicans who opposed the platform\r\n          said they believed the women of the State should have their\r\n          say about it; the Democratic platform said the same as the\r\n          dissenters from the Republican. Several humorous amendments\r\n          were made to the bill. Senator Kelley favored the bill\r\n          because there were a great many women in the State who\r\n          wanted to vote. He hoped the Senate would not be so\r\n          ungallant as to vote the bill down. Senator Sluss moved the\r\n          recommendation be made that the bill be rejected. Carried.\r\n\r\n     The Republican State convention of 1884 ignored the woman\r\n     suffrage question. The Anti-monopoly (Greenback) party State\r\n     convention, of August 1884, placed in its platform the following:\r\n\r\n          That we believe the advancing civilization of the past\r\n          quarter of the nineteenth century demands that woman should\r\n          have equal pay for equal work, and equal laws with man to\r\n          secure her equal rights, and that she is justly entitled to\r\n          the ballot.\r\n\r\n     Miss Fanny Randolph of Emporia, was nominated by acclamation for\r\n     State superintendent of public instruction, by this convention.\r\n     The Prohibition State convention, in session in Lawrence,\r\n     September 2, 1884, placed the following plank in its platform:\r\n\r\n          We believe that women have the same right to vote as men,\r\n          and in the language of the Republican State platform of two\r\n          years ago, we request the next legislature to submit such an\r\n          amendment to the constitution of the State as will secure to\r\n          woman the right of suffrage.\r\n\r\n     This year we sent from Lincoln a petition with 175 names asking\r\n     for a resolution recommending to congress the adoption of the\r\n     sixteenth amendment. The results of the election of 1884, showed\r\n     quite a gain for women in county offices. There are now eleven\r\n     superintendents of public instruction, several registers of\r\n     deeds, and county clerks. The number of lawyers,[482] physicians,\r\n     notaries public, principals of schools, members of school-boards\r\n     in cities and school districts, is rapidly increasing, as is also\r\n     the number of women who vote in school-district elections. Miss\r\n     Jessie Patterson, who ran as an independent candidate for\r\n     register of deeds in Davis county, beat the regular Republican\r\n     nominee 286 votes, and the Democratic candidate 299 votes.\r\n\r\n     The work of organizing suffrage societies has also progressed,\r\n     though not as rapidly as it should, for want of speakers and\r\n     means to carry it on. Through the efforts of Mrs. Laura M. Johns\r\n     of Salina, vice-president of the State society, several new and\r\n     flourishing clubs have been formed this summer in Saline county,\r\n     so that it is probably now the banner county in Kansas. The\r\n     Lincoln society is preparing to hold a fair in September, for the\r\n     benefit of the State association, which will hold its next annual\r\n     convention in October. Suffrage columns in newspapers are\r\n     multiplying and much stress is placed upon this branch of work.\r\n     On July 18, a convention was held to organize the Prohibition\r\n     party in Lincoln county. A cordial invitation was extended to\r\n     women to attend. Eight were present, and many more would have\r\n     been had they known of it. I was chosen secretary of the\r\n     convention, and Mesdames Ellsworth and Goff were appointed upon\r\n     the platform committee, and several of the central committee are\r\n     women. The position of the new party upon the question may be\r\n     inferred from the following clauses in its platform:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, By the Prohibition party of Lincoln county,\r\n          Kansas, in convention assembled, that the three vital issues\r\n          before the people to-day are prohibition, anti-monopoly, and\r\n          woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That we believe in the political equality of the\r\n          sexes, and we call on the legislature to submit such an\r\n          amendment to the people for adoption or rejection, to the\r\n          constitution of the State as will secure to women equal\r\n          political rights.\r\n\r\n     Later the convention nominated me for register of deeds, and Dr.\r\n     Sallie A. Goff for coroner. I immediately engaged Miss Jennie\r\n     Newby of Tonganoxie, member of the executive committee and State\r\n     organizer of the Prohibition party of Kansas, to make a canvass\r\n     of the county with me in the interest of the party and the county\r\n     ticket. We held ten meetings and at all points visited made\r\n     converts to both prohibition and woman suffrage, though nothing\r\n     was said about the latter. There were two men on the ticket; one\r\n     of them received more votes than Dr. Goff and I did, and the\r\n     other fewer. Emma Faris ran independently for register of deeds\r\n     in Ellsworth county and received a handsome vote. It is no longer\r\n     a matter of much comment for a woman to run for an office in\r\n     Kansas.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Gougar came again to Kansas in June to attend the third\r\n     annual meeting of the Radical Reform Christian Association, and\r\n     spent a month lecturing on woman suffrage and temperance.\r\n\r\n     January 15, 16, 1885, the annual meeting of the State society was\r\n     held at Topeka. Large and enthusiastic audiences greeted Mrs.\r\n     Gougar on this, her third visit to Kansas. She remained at the\r\n     capital for several days, and largely through her efforts with\r\n     members of the legislature special committees were voted for in\r\n     both Houses to consider the interests of women. The measure was\r\n     carried in the House by a vote of 75 to 45.[483] In the Senate it\r\n     was a tie, 19 to 19. The new committee[484] through its chairman,\r\n     George Morgan of Clay, reported in favor of a bill for municipal\r\n     suffrage. It was so low on the calendar that there was no hope of\r\n     its being reached, but a motion was made to take it out of its\r\n     regular course, which was lost by 65 to 52.\r\n\r\n     The second annual meeting of the State society was held at\r\n     Salina, October 28, 29, 1885. Mrs. Laura M. Johns gave the\r\n     address of welcome, to which Mrs. Anna C. Wait, the president,\r\n     responded. \"Mother Bickerdyke,\"[485] who followed Sherman's army\r\n     in its march to the sea, was present and cheered all with her\r\n     stirring words of the work of women in the war.[486] Her\r\n     introduction was followed with applause and the earnest attention\r\n     to her remarks showed in what high esteem she is held. She said\r\n     that half the work of the war was done by women, but she made no\r\n     complaint, indeed no mention, of the fact that these women had\r\n     never been pensioned.\r\n\r\n     As it may add force to some facts already stated to have them\r\n     repeated by one in authority, we give the following letter from\r\n     the secretary of the Kansas Historical Society:\r\n\r\n                         KANSAS HISTORICAL SOCIETY Topeka, Nov. 26, 1885\r\n\r\n          MISS SUSAN B. ANTHONY, Rochester, N. Y.:\r\n\r\n          _My Dear Friend_:--In answer to your request for information\r\n          upon certain points bearing upon the subject of woman\r\n          suffrage in Kansas, I give the following:\r\n\r\n          The women avail themselves quite generally of their\r\n          privilege of voting at the annual and special school\r\n          district meetings, at which district officers are elected,\r\n          and all questions of taxes and expenditures are voted on and\r\n          settled. Women are, in many instances, elected members of\r\n          the board of school directors, and thus are charged with the\r\n          duty of employing teachers, with the supervision of the\r\n          schools, and with the general management of the affairs of\r\n          the district. Women vote on the question of the issue of\r\n          school district bonds, and thus they take part in deciding\r\n          whether new school houses shall be built and the property of\r\n          the districts be pledged for the future payment of the cost\r\n          of the same.\r\n\r\n          In the chartered cities women do not generally vote for\r\n          school officers although, under the constitution, it is\r\n          believed they have the right to do so, and in one or more\r\n          instances I am informed they have done so, without the right\r\n          being contested. In cities, school officers are elected at\r\n          general elections for other city officers, for which women\r\n          are not permitted to vote, and as they cannot vote for all\r\n          they generally do not choose to vote for any. Women do not\r\n          vote for either city, county, or State superintendents, and\r\n          it is not considered that under our constitution they have\r\n          the right to do so.\r\n\r\n          In 1884, there were 4,915 women teaching in the State, and\r\n          1,936 men. The average monthly wages of women was $32.85,\r\n          and of men, $40.70. There are at present twelve women\r\n          holding the office of county superintendent of public\r\n          schools in the State. In 72 counties the office is filled by\r\n          men. Thus, of the 84 organized counties of the State,\r\n          one-seventh of the school superintendents are women, who\r\n          generally prove to be competent and efficient, and the\r\n          number elected is increasing.\r\n\r\n          In one county, Harper, a woman holds the office of county\r\n          clerk. A young woman was recently elected to the office of\r\n          register of deeds, in Davis county. It is conceded that\r\n          these two offices can very appropriately be filled by women;\r\n          and now that the movement has begun, no doubt the number of\r\n          those elected will increase at recurring elections. Already,\r\n          in numerous instances, women are employed as deputies and\r\n          assistants in these and other public offices.\r\n\r\n          The participation of women in school elections and their\r\n          election to membership of school district boards, are\r\n          resulting in a steady growth of sentiment in favor of woman\r\n          suffrage, generally. It is seen that in the decision of\r\n          questions involving the proper maintenance of schools, and\r\n          the supplying of school apparatus, women usually vote for\r\n          liberal and judicious expenditures, and make faithful school\r\n          officers. Their failures are not those of omission, as is so\r\n          frequently the case with men holding these offices. If they\r\n          err in judgment, it is from a lack of that business\r\n          information and experience which women as non-voters have\r\n          had little opportunity to acquire, but which, under our\r\n          Kansas system is now rapidly being supplied.\r\n\r\n          Among the influences tending to increase the suffrage\r\n          sentiment in Kansas, may be mentioned those growing out of\r\n          the active part women are taking in the discussion of\r\n          political, economical, moral and social questions, through\r\n          their participation in the proceedings of the Woman's\r\n          Christian Temperance Union, the State Temperance Union, the\r\n          Woman's Social Science Association, the Kansas Academy of\r\n          Science, the Grange, the State and local Teachers'\r\n          Associations, and many other organizations in which women\r\n          have come to perform so prominent a part. In these\r\n          organizations, and in the part they take in discussions,\r\n          they show their capacity to grapple with the political,\r\n          social, and scientific problems of the day, in such a manner\r\n          as to demonstrate their ability to perform the highest\r\n          duties of citizenship. Still the chief influence which is\r\n          bringing about a growth of opinion in favor of woman\r\n          suffrage in Kansas, comes from what has now become the\r\n          actual, and I may say, the popular and salutary practice of\r\n          woman suffrage at school district meetings. It is seen that\r\n          the reasons which make it right and expedient for women to\r\n          vote on questions pertaining to the education of their\r\n          children, bear with little, if any, less force upon the\r\n          propriety of their voting upon all questions affecting the\r\n          public welfare.\r\n\r\n          I think I may truly say to you that the tendencies in Kansas\r\n          are to the steady growth of sentiment in favor of woman\r\n          suffrage. This is so apparent that few of those even who do\r\n          not believe in its propriety or expediency now doubt that it\r\n          will eventually be adopted, and the political consequences\r\n          fully brought to the test of experience.\r\n\r\n                                   Yours sincerely,     F. G. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n     The greatest obstacle to our speedy success in this State, as\r\n     elsewhere, is the ignorance and indifference of the women\r\n     themselves. But the earnestness and enthusiasm of the few, in\r\n     their efforts from year to year, cannot be wholly lost--the fires\r\n     kindled by that memorable campaign of 1867 are not dead, only\r\n     slumbering, to burst forth with renewed brilliancy in the dawn of\r\n     the day that brings liberty, justice, and equality for woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[475] In the centennial year, when protests were in order, the\r\nfollowing was sent to the National Association at Philadelphia,\r\ndescribing the manner in which a lady eighty-four years old\r\ncelebrated her birthday:\r\n\r\n                              \"NEUTRAL STATION, Kansas, July 17, 1876.\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SISTERS: Two days ago, on Saturday, the 15th, as has been\r\n     usual for three or four years, a company of our friends and\r\n     neighbors met at our house to celebrate my eighty-fourth\r\n     birthday.

Though she did not accomplish what\r\nshe desired, yet by her conversations with the young men of the\r\nState, she may be said to have made the idea of woman suffrage seem\r\npracticable to those who formed the constitution and statute laws\r\nof that State.--[E.

Our meetings were held\r\nin an unfinished church without a floor, the audience sitting on\r\nthe beams, our opponents (two young lawyers) and ourselves on a few\r\nplanks laid across, where a small stand was placed and one tallow\r\ncandle to lighten the discussion that continued until a late hour.\r\nBeing delayed the next day at the depot a long time waiting for the\r\ntrain we held another prolonged discussion with these same sprigs\r\nof the legal profession. We had intended to go on to Ellsworth, but\r\nhearing of trouble there with the Indians we turned our faces\r\neastward.

Colorado, for\r\nexample, covers an area of 104,500 square miles. It is divided by\r\nthe Rocky Mountains running north and south, with two hundred lofty\r\npeaks rising thirteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, and\r\nsome still higher. To reach the voters in the little mining towns a\r\nhundred miles apart, over mountains such as these, involves\r\nhardships that only those who have made the journeys can\r\nunderstand. But there is some compensation in the variety, beauty\r\nand grandeur of the scenery, with its richly wooded valleys, vast\r\nparks and snow-capped mountains. It is the region for those awake\r\nto the sublime in nature to reverently worship some of her grandest\r\nworks that no poet can describe nor artist paint. Here, too, the\r\neternal struggle for liberty goes on, for the human soul can never\r\nbe attuned to harmony with its surroundings, especially the grand\r\nand glorious, until the birthright of justice and equality is\r\nsecured to all.\r\n\r\nFor a history of the early efforts made in the Centennial State to\r\nsecure equal rights for women, we are indebted to Mrs. Mary G.\r\nCampbell and Mrs. Katharine G. Patterson, two sisters who have been\r\nactively interested in the suffrage movement in Colorado, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     In 1848, while those immortal women whose names will be found on\r\n     many another page of the volume in which this chapter is\r\n     included, were asking in the convention at Seneca Falls, N. Y.,\r\n     that their equal membership in the human family might be admitted\r\n     by their husbands, fathers and sons, Colorado, unnamed and\r\n     unthought of, was still asleep with her head above the clouds.\r\n     Only two mountain-tops in all the-world were nearer heaven than\r\n     hers, and they, in far Thibet, had seen the very beginnings of\r\n     the race which, after six thousand years, had not yet penetrated\r\n     Colorado. Islanded in a cruel brown ocean of sand, she hid her\r\n     treasures of gold and silver in her virgin bosom and dreamed,\r\n     unstirred by any echoes of civilization. When she woke at last it\r\n     was to the sound of an anvil chorus--to the ring of the mallet\r\n     and drill, and the hoarse voices of men greedy only for gold.\r\n\r\n     In 1858, when the Ninth National Convention of women to demand\r\n     their legal rights was in session in New York, there were only\r\n     three white women in the now rich and beautiful city of Denver.\r\n     Still another ten years of wild border life, of fierce\r\n     vicissitudes, of unwritten tragedies enacted in forest and mine,\r\n     and Colorado was organized into a territory with a population of\r\n     5,000 women and 25,000 men.\r\n\r\n     The first effort for suffrage was made in 1870, during the fifth\r\n     session of the legislative assembly, soon after General Edward\r\n     McCook was sent out by President Grant to fill the gubernatorial\r\n     chair. In his message to the legislature, he promptly recommended\r\n     to the attention of its members the question of suffrage for\r\n     woman:\r\n\r\n          Before dismissing the subject of franchise, I desire to call\r\n          your attention to one question connected with it, which you\r\n          may deem of sufficient importance to demand some\r\n          consideration at your hands before the close of the session.\r\n          Our higher civilization has recognized woman's equality with\r\n          man in all respects save one--suffrage. It has been said\r\n          that no great reform was ever made without passing through\r\n          three stages--ridicule, argument, and adoption. It rests\r\n          with you to say whether Colorado will accept this reform in\r\n          its first stage, as our sister territory of Wyoming has\r\n          done, or in the last; whether she will be a leader or a\r\n          follower; for the logic of a progressive civilization leads\r\n          to the inevitable result of a universal suffrage.\r\n\r\n     This was the first gun of the campaign, and summoned to the field\r\n     various contending forces, armed with ridicule, argument, or an\r\n     optimistic diplomacy, urging an immediate surrender of the ground\r\n     claimed. Bills favoring the enfranchisement of women were\r\n     discussed both in the Territorial Council Chamber and in the\r\n     lower House of the legislature. The subject was taken up by the\r\n     press and the people, and not escaping its meed of ridicule, was\r\n     seriously dealt with by both friend and enemy. Perhaps the\r\n     western champions of woman's recognition as an intelligent part\r\n     of the body politic were brought to understand the full meaning\r\n     of her disabilities by their own experiences as territorial\r\n     minors. Certain it is that the high spirit of the citizens of\r\n     Colorado chafed intolerably under the temporary limitations of\r\n     accustomed rights of sovereign manhood. The federal government,\r\n     in the capacity of regent, sent to these territorial wards their\r\n     officers and governors and fixed the rate of their taxation\r\n     without full representation. These wards were indeed empowered,\r\n     as were the people of their sister territories, to elect a\r\n     delegate to the national congress, whose opinions upon\r\n     territorial matters were allowed expression in that body, but who\r\n     could no more enforce there his convictions upon important\r\n     measures, by a vote, than could the most intelligent woman of\r\n     this territory upon the question of his election to represent her\r\n     interests.\r\n\r\n     In the Colorado papers of those days of territorial tutelage,\r\n     there appeared repeatedly most impatient protests against these\r\n     humiliating conditions of citizenship. With the attainment of\r\n     statehood in 1876 there came to the men of Colorado a restoration\r\n     of their full rights as citizens of the Republic. According to\r\n     the proscriptive usage, the humiliating conditions of citizenship\r\n     without the ballot, remained to the women of the Centennial\r\n     State; and those of their reenfranchised brothers who had felt\r\n     most keenly their own unaccustomed restrictions, were without\r\n     doubt the foremost advocates of the movement to secure the full\r\n     recognition of women's rights.\r\n\r\n     The majority of the territorial legislative assembly of 1870 was\r\n     unexpectedly Democratic, and almost as unexpected was the favor\r\n     promptly shown by the Democratic members to the passage of the\r\n     bill proposing woman suffrage. The measure was indeed\r\n     characterized by the opposing Republicans, as \"the great\r\n     Democratic reform,\" and for weeks seemed destined to triumph\r\n     through Democratic votes, in spite of the frivolous and serious\r\n     opposition of the Republican minority, and the few Democratic\r\n     members who deserted what then seemed the party policy upon this\r\n     question. The pleas urged in advocacy of the new movement, as\r\n     well as the protests urged against it, were substantially the\r\n     same as were used in the East at that stage of the question.\r\n     Accompanying them were the extravagancies of hope and fear\r\n     incident to the early consideration of every suggested change in\r\n     a long-accepted social order. An impossible Utopia was promised\r\n     on the one hand no less confidently than was predicted upon the\r\n     other a dire iconoclasm of the sacred shrine of long-adored\r\n     ideals, as a consequence of simply granting to intelligent women\r\n     a privilege justly their due. Both the derision and the adverse\r\n     reasoning of the alarmists were well met by fearless friends, in\r\n     Council and House. Bills looking to the removal of woman's\r\n     disabilities were referred in each to a select committee for\r\n     consideration, on January 19. The majority report to the House\r\n     through the chairman of its special committee, M. DeFrance, was\r\n     an able advocacy of the measure under consideration, while the\r\n     adverse recommendation of the Council committee was accompanied\r\n     by an excellent report by Hon. Amos Steck, setting forth clearly\r\n     the reasons of the minority for their favorable views. After\r\n     hearing the reports, both Houses went into committee of the whole\r\n     for a free discussion upon the question.\r\n\r\n     \"The criterion of civilization, physical force,\" \"Strength as the\r\n     measure of right,\"--as recent writers have defined the divine\r\n     right of might--seemed the basis of reasoning with those who\r\n     claimed that woman should not be given the ballot because she\r\n     might not carry the sword. Dark pictures were drawn of possible\r\n     women as electors plunging their country into wars, from whose\r\n     consequences they would themselves suffer nothing. By the more\r\n     hopeful it was urged that the mighty heart, the moral force of\r\n     humanity, as represented in womanhood, and united with clear\r\n     womanly intelligence, would prove a greater power in all State\r\n     interests than sword or bayonet.\r\n\r\n     The strongest speaker in the legislature upon the subject of\r\n     suffrage--President Hinsdale of the Council--was, unfortunately,\r\n     a bitter enemy of the proposed reform. Yet some of his most\r\n     forcible utterances made in committee of the whole, were\r\n     excellent arguments in favor of, rather than against the measure.\r\n     Excellent arguments in favor of the bill in question were made by\r\n     leading members of the House--Messrs. Lea, Shepard and DeFrance.\r\n     By invitation of the legislature, that body was addressed by a\r\n     prominent member of the Denver bar, Mr. Willard Teller, the\r\n     brother of one of our U. S. senators. The hall was filled by an\r\n     interested audience to hear Mr. Teller's address, which was a\r\n     strong presentation of the principles upon which rest the claims\r\n     of American citizens to universal suffrage.\r\n\r\n     Outside the assembly halls, Governor McCook and his beautiful,\r\n     accomplished, and gracefully aggressive wife, strongly favored\r\n     the affirmative of the question at issue, while Willard Teller,\r\n     D. M. Richards and other distinguished men and women of the\r\n     territory were active friends during the contest. In the press,\r\n     the measure had a most influential support in the _Daily Colorado\r\n     Tribune_, a well-conducted Denver journal, edited by Mr. R. W.\r\n     Woodbury. Space in its columns was given to well-written articles\r\n     by contributors interested in the success of the cause, and many\r\n     able editorials appeared, embodying strong arguments in favor of\r\n     the reform, or answering the opposing bitterness and frivolity of\r\n     its contemporary the _Rocky Mountain News_. The interest in the\r\n     proposed innovation was indeed quite general throughout the\r\n     territory, but wherever the subject was discussed, in the\r\n     legislative halls, in private conversation, editorial column, or\r\n     correspondence of the press, the grounds argumentatively\r\n     traversed were the same highways and byways of reason and\r\n     absurdity which have been so often since gone over.\r\n\r\n     There was perhaps one lion in the way of establishing universal\r\n     suffrage in the West, which the eastern advocates did not fear.\r\n     It was said that our intelligent women could not be allowed to\r\n     vote, whatever the principles upon which the right might be\r\n     claimed, because in that case, the poor, degraded Chinese women\r\n     who might reach our shores, would also be admitted to the voting\r\n     list, and what then would become of our proud, Caucasian\r\n     civilization? Whether it was the thought of the poor Mongolian\r\n     slave at the polls, or some other equally terrifying vision of a\r\n     yearly visit of American women to the centre of some voting\r\n     precinct, the majority of the Colorado legislative assembly of\r\n     1870, in spite of all the free discussion of the campaign of that\r\n     year, decided adversely. In the latter days of the session, the\r\n     bill having taken the form of a proposition to submit the\r\n     question at issue to the already qualified voters of the\r\n     territory, was lost in the council chamber by a majority of one,\r\n     and in the House by a two-thirds majority, leaving to the\r\n     defeated friends of the reform as their only reward, a\r\n     consciousness of strength gained in the contest.\r\n\r\n     A few years more made Denver a city beautiful for habitation,\r\n     made Colorado a garden, filled that goodly land with capable men,\r\n     and intelligent, spirited women. Statehood had been talked of,\r\n     but lost, and then men began to say: \"The one hundredth birthday\r\n     of our American independence is so near, let us make this a\r\n     centennial State; let the entrance into the Union be announced by\r\n     the same bells that shall ring in our national anniversary.\" And\r\n     so it was decreed. Mindful of 1776--mindful too, of the second\r\n     declaration made by the women at the first equal rights\r\n     convention in 1848, the friends of equality in Colorado\r\n     determined to gird themselves for a supreme effort in\r\n     anticipation of the constitution that was to be framed for the\r\n     new State to be.\r\n\r\n     A notice was published asking all persons favorable to suffrage\r\n     for women, to convene in Denver, January 10, to take measures to\r\n     secure the recognition of woman's equality under the pending\r\n     constitution. In pursuance to this call, a large and eager\r\n     audience filled Unity Church long before the hour appointed for\r\n     the meeting. A number of the orthodox clergy were present. The\r\n     Rev. Mrs. Wilkes of Colorado Springs, opened the exercises with\r\n     prayer. Mrs. Margaret W. Campbell of Massachusetts was then\r\n     introduced, and said: \"This convention was called to present\r\n     woman's claims to the ballot, from her own stand-point, and to\r\n     take such measures to secure the recognition of her equality in\r\n     the constitution of Colorado, as the friends gathered from\r\n     different parts of the territory may think proper. We do not ask\r\n     that women shall take the places of men, or usurp authority over\r\n     them; we only ask that the principles upon which our government\r\n     is founded shall be applied to women.\r\n\r\n     Rev. Mrs. Wilkes made an especial point of the fact that in\r\n     Colorado Springs women owned one-third of the taxable property,\r\n     and yet were obliged (at the recent spring election) to see the\r\n     bonds for furnishing a supply of pure water, voted down because\r\n     women had no voice in the matter. This had been a serious\r\n     mistake, as the physicians of the place had pronounced the\r\n     present supply impure and unwholesome. She referred to the fears\r\n     of many that the constitution, freighted with woman suffrage,\r\n     might sink, when it would else be buoyant, and begged her hearers\r\n     not to fear such a burden would endanger it. The convention\r\n     continued through two days with enthusiastic speeches from Mr. D.\r\n     M. Richards and Rev. Mr. Wright, who preferred to be introduced\r\n     as the nephew of Dr. Harriot K. Hunt of Boston. Letters were read\r\n     from Lucy Stone and Judge Kingman, and an extract from the\r\n     message of Governor Thayer of Wyoming, in which he declared the\r\n     results of woman suffrage in that territory to have been\r\n     beneficial and its influence favorable to the best interests of\r\n     the community. A territorial society was formed with an efficient\r\n     board of officers;[487] resolutions, duly discussed, were\r\n     adopted, and the meeting closed with a carefully-prepared\r\n     address by Dr. Avery, the newly-elected president of the\r\n     territorial association.\r\n\r\n     The committee[488] appointed to wait upon the constitutional\r\n     convention were received courteously by that body, and listened\r\n     to with respectful attention. One would have thought the\r\n     gentlemen to whom the arguments and appeals of such women were\r\n     addressed would have found it in their hearts to make some reply,\r\n     even while disclaiming the official character of their act; but\r\n     they preserved a decorous and non-committal, if not incurious\r\n     silence, and the ladies withdrew. The press said, the morning\r\n     after their visit: \"The gentlemen were all interested and amused\r\n     by the errand of the ladies.\" The morning following, the\r\n     constitutional convention was memorialized by the Suffrage\r\n     Association of Missouri, and was also presented with a petition\r\n     signed by a thousand citizens of Colorado, asking that in the new\r\n     constitution no distinction be made on account of sex. This was\r\n     only the beginning. Petitions came in afterwards, numerously\r\n     signed, and were intended to have the force of a sort of\r\n     ante-election vote.\r\n\r\n     Denver presented an interesting social aspect at this time. It\r\n     was as if the precursive tremor of a moral earthquake had been\r\n     felt, and people, only half awake, did not know whether to seek\r\n     safety in the house, or outside of it. Women especially were\r\n     perplexed and inquiring, and it was observed that those in favor\r\n     of asking a recognition of their rights in the new State, were\r\n     the intelligent and leading ladies of the city. The wives of\r\n     ministers, of congressmen, of judges, the prominent members of\r\n     Shakespeare clubs, reading circles, the directors of charitable\r\n     institutions,--these were the ones who first ranged themselves on\r\n     the side of equal rights, clearly proving that the man was right\r\n     who pointed out the danger of allowing women to learn the\r\n     alphabet.\r\n\r\n     When February 15 came, it was a momentous day for Colorado. The\r\n     report of the Committee on Suffrage and Elections was to come up\r\n     for final action. As a matter of fact there were two reports;\r\n     that of the minority was signed by two members of the committee,\r\n     Judge Bromwell, whose breadth and scholarship were apparent in\r\n     his able report, and a Mexican named Agapita Vigil, a legislator\r\n     from Southern Colorado where Spanish is the dominant tongue. Mr.\r\n     Vigil spoke no English, and was one of those representatives for\r\n     whose sake an interpreter was maintained during the session of\r\n     the convention.\r\n\r\n     Ladies were present in large numbers. Some of the gentlemen\r\n     celebrated the occasion by an unusual spruceness of attire, and\r\n     others by being sober enough to attend to business. The report\r\n     with three-fifths of the signatures, after setting forth that the\r\n     subject had had careful consideration, went on to state the\r\n     qualifications of voters, namely, that all should be male\r\n     citizens, with one exception, and that was, that women might vote\r\n     for school district officers.\r\n\r\n     Mr. A. K. Yount of Boulder, spoke in favor of the motion to\r\n     strike out the word \"male\" in section 1: \"That every male person\r\n     over the age of 21 years, possessing the necessary\r\n     qualifications, shall be entitled to vote,\" etc. He called\r\n     attention to the large number of petitions which had been sent\r\n     in, asking for this, and to the fact that not a single\r\n     remonstrance had been received. He believed the essential\r\n     principles of human freedom were involved in this demand, and he\r\n     insisted that justice required that women should help to make the\r\n     laws by which they are governed. The amendment was lost by a vote\r\n     of 24 to 8.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Storm offered an amendment that women be permitted to vote\r\n     for, and hold the office of, county superintendent of schools.\r\n     This also was lost. The only other section of the report which\r\n     had any present interest to women, was the one reading:\r\n\r\n          SECTION 2. The General Assembly may at any time extend by\r\n          law the right of suffrage to persons not herein enumerated,\r\n          but no such law shall take effect or be in force until the\r\n          same shall have been submitted to a vote of the people, at a\r\n          general election, and approved by a majority of all the\r\n          votes cast for and against such law.\r\n\r\n     After much discussion it was voted that the first General\r\n     Assembly should provide a law whereby the subject should be\r\n     submitted to a vote of the electors.\r\n\r\n     After this the curtain fell, the lights were put out, and all the\r\n     atmosphere and _mise en scene_ of the drama vanished. It was well\r\n     known, however, that another season would come, the actors would\r\n     reaeppear, and an \"opus\" would be given; whether it should turn\r\n     out a tragedy, or a Miriam's song of deliverance, no one was able\r\n     to predict. Meantime, the women of Colorado--to change the\r\n     figure--bivouacked on the battle-field, and sent for\r\n     reinforcements against the fall campaign. They held themselves\r\n     well together, and used their best endeavors to educate public\r\n     sentiment.\r\n\r\n     A column in the Denver _Rocky Mountain News_, a pioneer paper\r\n     then edited by W. N. Byers, was offered the woman suffrage\r\n     association, through which to urge our claims. The column was put\r\n     into the hands of Mrs. Campbell, the wife of E. L. Campbell, of\r\n     the law firm of Patterson & Campbell of Denver, for editorship.\r\n     This lady, from whose editorials quotations will be given, was\r\n     too timid (she herself begs us to say cowardly) to use her name\r\n     in print, and so translated it into its German equivalent of\r\n     _Schlachtfeld_, thus nullifying whatever of weight her own name\r\n     would have carried in the way of personal and social endorsement\r\n     of an unpopular cause. Her sister, Mrs. T. M. Patterson, an early\r\n     and earnest member of the Colorado Suffrage Association, \"bore\r\n     testimony\" as courageously and constantly as her environment\r\n     permitted.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Gov. McCook, as previously stated, had been the first woman\r\n     in Colorado to set the example of a spirited claim to simple\r\n     political justice for her sex, but she, alas! at the date now\r\n     reached in our sketch, was dead--in her beautiful youth, in the\r\n     first flower of her sweet, bright womanhood. Her loss to the\r\n     cause can best be measured by those who know what an immense\r\n     uplifting power is present when an intelligent man in an\r\n     influential position joins his personal and political force to\r\n     his wife's personal and social force in the endeavor to\r\n     accomplish an object dear to both.\r\n\r\n     It is a pity not to register here, however inadequately, some\r\n     outline of many figures that rise to form a part of the picture\r\n     of Colorado in 1876-7. When liberty shall have been achieved, and\r\n     all citizens shall be comfortably enjoying its direct and\r\n     indirect blessings, this book should be found to have preserved\r\n     in the amber of its pages the names of those who bravely wrought\r\n     for freedom in that earlier time. Would that one might indeed\r\n     summon them all by a roll-call! But they will not answer--they\r\n     say only: \"Let our work stand for us, be its out-come small or\r\n     great.\"\r\n\r\n     To Dr. Alida C. Avery, however, whatever the outcome, a weighty\r\n     obligation is due from all past, present and future laborers in\r\n     this cause in Colorado. She it was who set at work and kept at\r\n     work the interplay of ideas and efforts which accomplished what\r\n     was done. Through her personal acquaintance with the immortals at\r\n     the East, Lucy Stone, Susan B. Anthony, Henry B. Blackwell, she\r\n     drew them to Colorado during the campaign about to be described,\r\n     and with them came others. Mrs. M. W. Campbell and her husband\r\n     reaeppeared to do faithful service, and then came also Miss Lelia\r\n     Patridge of Philadelphia, a young, graceful, and effective\r\n     speaker,--so the local papers constantly describe her, and then\r\n     came, in the person of Miss Matilda Hindman of Pittsburg Pa., one\r\n     of the ablest women of the whole campaign. Gentle, persuasive,\r\n     womanly, she was at the same time armed at all points with fact,\r\n     argument, and illustration, and her zeal was only equaled by her\r\n     power of sustained labor.\r\n\r\n     Many of these same qualities belong to Mrs. M. F. Shields, of\r\n     Colorado Springs, one of the committee on constitutional work in\r\n     the campaign of 1876, and an ardent, unceasing, unselfish laborer\r\n     in the church, in suffrage and temperance, for more than ten\r\n     years. She did not lecture, but \"talked\"; talked to five hundred\r\n     men at a time as if they were her own sons, and only needed to be\r\n     shown they were conniving at injustice, in order to turn about\r\n     and do the right thing. This same element of \"motherliness\" it\r\n     was, which gained her the respectful attention of an audience of\r\n     the roughest and most ignorant Cornish miners up in Caribou, who\r\n     would listen to no other woman speaking upon the subject. When\r\n     the members of the famous constitutional committee were\r\n     considering the suffrage petition, prior to making their report,\r\n     Judge Stone of Pueblo, tried to persuade the Spanish-speaking\r\n     member that to grant the franchise to women would be to be false\r\n     to his party, as those women were all Democrats. But Senor Vigil\r\n     replied that he had been talking through his interpreter to the\r\n     \"nice old lady, who smiled so much\" (meaning Mrs. Shields), and\r\n     he knew what they asked was all right, and he should vote for it.\r\n\r\n     Of the men who were willing to obey Paul's entreaty to \"help\r\n     those women,\" must be named in the front rank David M. Richards\r\n     of Denver, a pioneer of '59, and as brave and generous and true a\r\n     heart as ever beat in time to the pulse of progress, Rev. B. F.\r\n     Crary, a true apostolic helper, Mr. Henry C. Dillon, a young\r\n     western Raleigh for knightly chivalry, Hon. J. B. Belford, member\r\n     of congress then and now, Judge H. P. H. Bromwell, who needs no\r\n     commendation from the historian, as his eloquent minority report\r\n     speaks adequately for him; these, and very many more, both men\r\n     and women, have, as the French say, \"deserved well of the State\r\n     and of their generation.\"\r\n\r\n     And it was once more to the aid of these men and women that the\r\n     East sent reinforcements as soon as the winter of 1877 was well\r\n     ushered in. An annual convention was announced for January 15, in\r\n     Denver. When the bitter cold evening came it seemed doubtful if\r\n     any great number of persons would be present, but the large\r\n     Lawrence street Methodist Church was, on the contrary, packed to\r\n     its utmost capacity. Rev. Mr. Eads, pastor of the church, opened\r\n     the meeting with prayer, and Dr. Avery, as president of the\r\n     association, gave a brief _resume_ of the work during its one\r\n     year of existence. Colonel Henry Logan of Boulder (formerly of\r\n     Illinois), made a manly and telling speech in favor of a measure\r\n     which he called one of axiomatic justice. Mrs. Wright of New\r\n     York, after a piquant address, announced the meeting of the\r\n     convention for the next day. On the following morning a business\r\n     session was held, and officers elected for the year.[489] In the\r\n     afternoon speeches were made by Dr. Crary, Mrs. Shields, and Mr.\r\n     David Boyd of Greeley, and in the evening by Mr. Henry C. Dillon\r\n     and Rev. J. R. Eads, the closing and crowning speech of the\r\n     convention being given by Miss Laura Hanna of Denver, a _petite_,\r\n     pretty young girl, whose remarks made a _bonne bouche_ with which\r\n     to close the feast. Interest in the subject rose to fever heat\r\n     before October. Pulpit, press and fireside were occupied with its\r\n     discussion. The most effective, and at the same time,\r\n     exasperating opposition, came from the pulpit, but there was also\r\n     vigorous help from the same quarter. The Catholic Bishop preached\r\n     a series of sermons and lectures, in which he fulminated all the\r\n     thunders of apostolic and papal revelation against women who\r\n     wanted to vote:\r\n\r\n          Though strong-minded women who are not satisfied with the\r\n          disposition of Providence and who wish to go beyond the\r\n          condition of their sex, profess no doubt to be Christians,\r\n          do they consult the Bible?--do they follow the Bible? I fear\r\n          not. Had God intended to create a companion for man, capable\r\n          of following the same pursuits, able to undertake the same\r\n          labors, he would have created another man; but he created a\r\n          woman, and she fell. * * * The class of women wanting\r\n          suffrage are battalions of old maids disappointed in\r\n          love--women separated from their husbands or divorced by men\r\n          from their sacred obligations--women who, though married,\r\n          wish to hold the reins of the family government, for there\r\n          never was a woman happy in her home who wished for female\r\n          suffrage. * * * Who will take charge of those young children\r\n          (if they consent to have any) while mothers as surgeons are\r\n          operating indiscriminately upon the victims of a terrible\r\n          railway disaster? * * * No kind husband will refuse to\r\n          nurse the baby on Sunday (when every kind of business is\r\n          stopped) in order to let his wife attend church; but even\r\n          then, as it is not his natural duty, he will soon be tired\r\n          of it and perhaps get impatient waiting for the mother,\r\n          chiefly when the baby is crying.\r\n\r\n     These, with the omnipresent quotations from St. Paul to the\r\n     effect that women shall keep silence in the church, etc., formed\r\n     the argument of the Bishop in two or three lengthy sermons.\r\n     Indignant men, disgusted with the caliber of the opposition and\r\n     yet obliged to notice it on account of the position of the\r\n     divine, made ample rejoinders. Rev. Dr. Crary of Golden, in an\r\n     exhaustive review of the Bishop's discourse, deprecated the\r\n     making permanent and of universal application the commands which\r\n     with Paul were evidently temporary and local, and said half the\r\n     churches in Christendom would be closed if these were literally\r\n     obeyed:\r\n\r\n          \"Women should not usurp authority, therefore men should\r\n          usurp all authority.\" This is the sort of logic we have\r\n          always heard from men who are trotting along in the wake of\r\n          progress and howling because the centuries do not stop\r\n          rolling onward. In barbarous regions Paul is paraded against\r\n          educating girls at all. In half-civilized nations Paul is\r\n          doing service against educating girls except in the\r\n          rudiments. Among people who are just beginning to see the\r\n          hill-tops of a higher, nobler world, Paul is still on duty\r\n          crowding off women from high-schools and colleges. Proud\r\n          universities to-day have Paul standing guard over medical\r\n          meanness and pushing down aspiring female souls from the\r\n          founts of knowledge. Within our memory Paul has been the\r\n          standing demonstration in favor of slavery, intemperance and\r\n          the oppression of women.\r\n\r\n     Another sermon in which the Bishop lays solemn stress on the one\r\n     sacred, inevitable duty of women to become wives and mothers, was\r\n     answered by Mr. David Boyd of Greeley, who, among other things,\r\n     asks the Bishop:\r\n\r\n          How, in view of the injunction to increase and multiply, he\r\n          can justify the large celibate class created by positive\r\n          command of the Catholic church, not only by the ordination\r\n          of priests, but by the constant urging of the church that\r\n          women should become the barren brides of Christ by taking on\r\n          them the vows of nuns.\r\n\r\n     The Bishop published his lectures in pamphlet form, that their\r\n     influence might be far-reaching, and curiously enough, the very\r\n     same lectures were printed and scattered by the friends of\r\n     suffrage as the best sort of document for the campaign now fairly\r\n     inaugurated. D. M. Richards, the able chairman of the executive\r\n     committee, and Dr. Avery, president of the association, showed\r\n     themselves capable of both conceiving and executing a plan of\r\n     operations which had the merit of at least deserving victory.\r\n\r\n     There was no lack of pens to defend women's claim to equal\r\n     chances in the struggle for existence. In Denver, the _Rocky\r\n     Mountain News_ and the _Times_ planted themselves fairly and\r\n     squarely in an affirmative attitude, and gave generous aid to the\r\n     effort. The _Tribune's_ columns were in a state of chronic\r\n     congestion from a plethora of protests, both feminine and\r\n     masculine. One young lawyer said: \"If suffrage is to come, let it\r\n     come by man's call, and not by woman's clamor\"; and, \"When all\r\n     the women of the land can show the ability to rear a family, and\r\n     at the same time become eminent in some profession or art, then\r\n     men will gladly welcome them.\" Whereupon the women naturally\r\n     rushed into print to protest against the qualifications required\r\n     of them, compared with those required of men.\r\n\r\n     It is safe to say, that from the middle of January, 1877, until\r\n     the following October, the most prominent theme of public\r\n     discussion was this question of suffrage for women. Miners\r\n     discussed it around their camp-fires, and \"freighters\" on their\r\n     long slow journeys over the mountain trails argued _pro_ and\r\n     _con_, whether they should \"let\" women have the ballot. Women\r\n     themselves argued and studied and worked earnestly. One lawyer's\r\n     wife, who declared that no refined woman would contend for such a\r\n     right, and that no woman with self-respect would be found\r\n     electioneering, herself urged every man of her acquaintance to\r\n     vote against the measure, and even triumphantly reported that she\r\n     had spoken to seventy-five men who were strangers to her, and\r\n     secured their promise to vote against the pending amendment.\r\n     This, however, must not be mistaken for electioneering.\r\n\r\n     On Wednesday, August 15, an equal rights mass-meeting was held in\r\n     Denver, for the purpose of organizing a county central committee,\r\n     and for an informal discussion of plans for the campaign. Judge\r\n     H. P. H. Bromwell and H. C. Dillon spoke, with earnest repetition\r\n     of former pledges of devotion to the cause, and Gov. Evans said:\r\n\r\n          Equal suffrage is necessary to equal rights. It is fortunate\r\n          that we have in Colorado an opportunity of bringing to bear\r\n          the restraining, purifying and ennobling influence of women\r\n          upon politics. It is a reform that will require all the\r\n          benign influences of the country to sustain and carry out,\r\n          and, as I hope for the perpetuation of our free\r\n          institutions, I dare not neglect the most promising and\r\n          potent means of purifying politics, and I regard the\r\n          influence of women as this means.\r\n\r\n     Major Bright of Wyoming, was introduced as the man who framed and\r\n     brought in the first bill for the enfranchisement of women. Judge\r\n     W. B. Mills said: \"It is an anomalous condition of affairs which\r\n     made it necessary for a woman to ask a man whether she should\r\n     vote,\" and referring to all the reforms and changes of the last\r\n     half century, predicted that the extension of the franchise to\r\n     woman would be the next in order.\r\n\r\n     The meeting was a full and fervid one, and great confidence of\r\n     success was felt and expressed. A committee of seventeen was\r\n     appointed[490] and this committee did its full duty in\r\n     districting the territory and sending out speakers. Mr. Henry B.\r\n     Blackwell, Lucy Stone and Miss Anthony arrived almost immediately\r\n     after this, and henceforth the advocates of suffrage swarmed\r\n     through the rocky highways and byways of Colorado as eagerly, if\r\n     not as multitudinously, as its gold seekers. Mrs. Campbell wrote\r\n     to the _Woman's Journal_:\r\n\r\n          We have now been at work two weeks. Some of our meetings are\r\n          very encouraging, some not so much so. But the meetings are\r\n          only one feature of the work. We stop along the way and\r\n          search out all the leading men in each voting precinct, and\r\n          secure the names of those who will work on election day. We\r\n          do more talking out of meeting than in. We rode thirty-five\r\n          miles yesterday, and arrived here after six o'clock in the\r\n          evening. While Mr. Campbell was taking care of the horse, I\r\n          filled out bills before taking off my hat and duster; in\r\n          fifteen minutes they were being distributed, and at eight\r\n          o'clock I was speaking to a good-sized audience.\r\n\r\n     On October 1, a monster meeting was held in the Lawrence street\r\n     Methodist Church, and was addressed by Lucy Stone, Miss Matilda\r\n     Hindman, Mrs. Campbell, and Dr. Avery. The most intense interest\r\n     was manifested, and the excellent speeches heartily applauded.\r\n\r\n     The next day (Sunday) the Rev. Dr. Bliss of the Presbyterian\r\n     Church, preached a sermon in his own pulpit, on \"Woman Suffrage\r\n     and the Model Wife and Mother,\" in which he alluded to \"certain\r\n     brawling, ranting women, bristling for their rights,\" and said\r\n     God had intended woman to be a wife and mother, and the eternal\r\n     fitness of things forbade her to be anything else. If women could\r\n     vote, those who were wives now would live in endless bickerings\r\n     with their husbands over politics, and those who were not wives\r\n     would not marry.\"\r\n\r\n     These utterences brought out many replies. One was in the column\r\n     edited by \"Mrs. Schlachtfeld,\" and may perhaps be quoted as a\r\n     specimen of her editorial work, such being, as we have intimated,\r\n     her one service to suffrage, and that incognito:\r\n\r\n          One of the daily, dismal forecasts of the male Cassandras of\r\n          our time is, that in the event of women becoming emancipated\r\n          from the legal thralldom that disables them, they will\r\n          acquire a sudden distaste for matrimony, the direful\r\n          consequences of which will be a gradual extermination of\r\n          homes, and the extinction of the human species. This is an\r\n          artless and extremely suggestive lament. In the first\r\n          place--accepting that prophecy as true--why will women not\r\n          marry? Because, they will then be independent of men;\r\n          because in a fair field for competition where ability and\r\n          not sex shall determine employment and remuneration, women\r\n          will have an equal chance with men for distinction and\r\n          reward, for triumphs commercial and professional as well as\r\n          social, and hence, needing men less, either to make them\r\n          homes, or to gratify indirectly their ambitions, their\r\n          affections will become atrophied, the springs of domestic\r\n          life will disappear in the arid sands of an unfeminine\r\n          publicity, and marriage, with all the wearying cares and\r\n          burdens and anxieties that it inevitably brings to every\r\n          earnest woman, will be regarded more and more as a state to\r\n          be shunned. The few who enter it will be compassionated much\r\n          as a minister is who undertakes a dangerous foreign mission.\r\n          Men will stand mateless, and the ruins of the hymeneal\r\n          altars everywhere crumble mournfully away, and be known to\r\n          tradition only by their vanishing inscriptions: \"To the\r\n          unknown god.\" But it is ill jesting over that which tugs at\r\n          every woman's heartstrings and which impinges upon the very\r\n          life-centres of society. If women, on being made really free\r\n          to choose, will not marry, then we must arraign men on the\r\n          charge of having made the married state so irksome and\r\n          distasteful to women that they prefer celibacy when they\r\n          dare enjoy it. Observe, however, the inconsistency of\r\n          another line of reasoning running parallel with this in the\r\n          floating literature of the day: \"Motherhood,\" these writers\r\n          say, \"is the natural vocation of women; is, indeed, an\r\n          instinct so mighty, even if unconscious, that it draws women\r\n          toward matrimony with a yearning as irresistible as that\r\n          which pulls the great sea upon the land in blind response to\r\n          the moon.\" If this be true, society is safe, and women will\r\n          still be wives, no matter how much they may exult in\r\n          political freedom, no matter how alluringly individual\r\n          careers may open before them, nor how accessible the\r\n          tempting prizes of human ambition may become.\r\n\r\n     Well, the day came,--the _dies irae_ for one side or the other,\r\n     and it proved to be for the \"one.\" The measure was defeated. Ten\r\n     thousand votes were for it, twenty thousand against it. Women\r\n     remained at the polls all day, distributing ballots, and\r\n     answering objections. They had flowers on all the little tables\r\n     where the tickets were heaped, on which were printed the three\r\n     words, \"Woman Suffrage Approved,\" words for many pregnant with\r\n     hope for a new impetus to civilization, for others with a\r\n     misfortune only to be compared to that which happened in Greece\r\n     when Ino boiled the seed corn of a whole kingdom, and thus not\r\n     only lost the crop of that year, but, by the subtle interplay of\r\n     the laws by which evolution proceeds, set back humanity for a\r\n     period not to be reckoned in years. Mrs. H. S. Mendenhall of\r\n     Georgetown wrote to Dr. Avery on the evening of election day:\r\n\r\n          Before this reaches you the telegraph will have given you\r\n          the result of the day's work all over the State, but I\r\n          thought I would jot down a line while the experiences of the\r\n          last ten hours were fresh in my mind. Last evening our\r\n          committee appointed ladies to represent the interests of\r\n          woman suffrage at the polls. To my surprise, many evaded the\r\n          work who were, nevertheless, strongly in favor of the\r\n          measure. Mrs. Dr. Collins and I were the only ones at the\r\n          lowest and most important precinct until one o'clock, when\r\n          we were joined by the wife of the Presbyterian minister. Our\r\n          course was somewhat as follows: On the approach of a voter,\r\n          we would ask him, \"have you voted?\" If he had, we usually\r\n          troubled him no further; if he had not, we asked, \"Can you\r\n          vote for woman suffrage?\" If he approved, we supplied him\r\n          with his ticket; if he disapproved, we asked him for his\r\n          objections, and we have listened to some comical ones\r\n          to-day. One man asked me, though not rudely, \"Who is cooking\r\n          your husband's dinner?\" I promptly invited him to dine with\r\n          us. Another spoke of neglected household duties, and when I\r\n          mentioned a loaf of bread I had just baked, and should be\r\n          glad to have him see, he said, \"I expect you can bake\r\n          bread,\" but he voted against us. The Methodist men were for\r\n          us; the Presbyterians and Episcopalians very fairly so, and\r\n          the Roman Catholics were not all against us, some of the\r\n          prominent members of that church working and voting for\r\n          woman suffrage. The liquor interest went entirely against\r\n          us, as far as I know.\r\n\r\n          The observations of the day have led me to several general\r\n          conclusions, to which, of course, exceptions exist: (1)\r\n          Married men will vote for suffrage if their wives appreciate\r\n          its importance. (2) Men without family ties, and especially\r\n          if they have associated with a bad class of women, will vote\r\n          against it. (3) Boys who have just reached their majority\r\n          will vote against it more uniformly than any other class of\r\n          men. We were treated with the utmost respect by all except\r\n          the last class. Destitute of experience, and big with their\r\n          own importance, these young sovereigns will speak to a woman\r\n          twice their years with a flippancy which the most ignorant\r\n          foreigner of mature age would not use, and I have to-day\r\n          been tempted to believe that no one is fitted to exercise\r\n          the American franchise under twenty-five years of age.\r\n\r\n          The main objection which I heard repeatedly urged was, women\r\n          do not want to vote. This seems to be the great\r\n          stumbling-block to our brethren. Men were continually saying\r\n          that their wives told them not to vote for woman suffrage.\r\n          If we are defeated this time I know we can succeed in the\r\n          next campaign, or just as soon as we can educate enough\r\n          prominent women up to the point of coming out plainly on the\r\n          subject. Then all men, or all but the vicious men who always\r\n          vote against every good thing, will give in right away.\r\n\r\n     Lucy Stone, in a letter to the _Woman's Journal_ describes\r\n     similar scenes enacted that day in Denver; speaks of the order\r\n     and quiet prevailing at the polls, of the flowers on all the\r\n     tables, and, in spite of the strangeness of the occasion, of the\r\n     presence of women as evidently a new and beneficent element\r\n     there. Rev. Dr. Ellis of the Baptist Church, who, on the Sunday\r\n     before had preached from the text, \"Help those Women,\" was using\r\n     his influence to convert those doubtful or opposed. Rev. Mr.\r\n     Bliss, who had declared in his pulpit that \"the only two women\r\n     the Bible mentioned as having meddled in politics were Jezebel\r\n     and Herodias,\" was there also, to warn men not to vote for equal\r\n     rights for women. At other polls I saw colored men, once slaves,\r\n     electioneering and voting against the rights of women. When\r\n     remonstrated with, one said: \"We want the women at home cooking\r\n     our dinners.\" A shrewd colored woman asked whether they had\r\n     provided any dinner to cook, and added that most of the colored\r\n     women there had to earn their dinner as well as cook it.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Hear the conclusion of the whole matter. In the words of the last\r\n     editorial of the woman's column in the _Rocky Mountain News_:\r\n\r\n          Woman's hour has not yet struck! The chimes that were\r\n          waiting to ring out the tidings of her liberty--the candles\r\n          furtively stored against an illumination which should typify\r\n          a new influx of light, the achievement of a victory whose\r\n          meaning and promise at least seemed to those who both prayed\r\n          and worked for it, neither trivial nor selfish--all these\r\n          are relegated to the guardianship of Patience and Hope.\r\n          Colorado has refused to enfranchise its women. * * * * * *\r\n          The Germans, the Catholics, and the negroes were said to be\r\n          against us. Naturally, those who themselves most keenly\r\n          feel, or most recently have felt, the galling yoke of\r\n          arbitrary rule, are most disposed to derive a certain\r\n          enjoyment from the daily contemplation of a noble class\r\n          still in bondage. * * * * * * But _all_ opposition, in\r\n          whatever guise, comes back at last to be written under one\r\n          rubric--the immaturity of woman. We make this dispassionate\r\n          statement of a fact. We feel neither scorn nor anger, and we\r\n          trust that we shall excite none. It is a fault which time\r\n          will cure, but meantime it is the grand factor in our\r\n          account. Every other argument has been met--every other\r\n          stronghold of opposition taken. Woman's claim to the ballot\r\n          has been shown to rest in justice on the very foundation\r\n          stone of democratic government--has been, from the Christian\r\n          standpoint, as completely exonerated from the charge of\r\n          impiety as ever anti-slavery and anti-polygamy were, and the\r\n          fact which was the slogan of the anti-suffragists still\r\n          remains: the mass of the women do not want it. We do not\r\n          quarrel with the fact, but state it to give the real reason\r\n          for our failures--the real objective point for our future\r\n          work.\r\n\r\n          The complacency with which we are able to state without fear\r\n          of contradiction that the body of intelligent and thoughtful\r\n          women _do_ want suffrage must not obscure our perception of\r\n          the equal truth of what we have just stated above. To accept\r\n          this verity and turn our energies toward the emancipation of\r\n          our own sex--toward their emancipation from frivolous aims,\r\n          petty prejudices, and that attitude toward the other sex\r\n          which is really the sycophancy born of vanity and weakness;\r\n          to make them recognize the State as a multiplication of\r\n          their own families, and patriotism as the broadening of\r\n          their love of home; to make them see that that mother will\r\n          be most respected whose son does not, when a downy beard is\r\n          grown, suddenly tower above her in the supercilious\r\n          enjoyment of an artificial superiority--a superiority which\r\n          consists simply, as Figaro says, in his having taken the\r\n          trouble to be born; to make them see, finally, that in the\r\n          highest exercise of all the powers with which God has\r\n          endowed her, woman can no more refuse the duties of\r\n          citizenship, than she can refuse the duties of wifehood and\r\n          motherhood, once having accepted those sacred relations.\r\n          This is our first duty, and this the scope of our work, if\r\n          we would attain suffrage in 1879, or even in 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[487] _President_, Alida C.

Mrs. Shields is one of the most lovable\r\nwomen to be seen in the suffrage panorama; a tower of strength in\r\nher own family, where she is at once the comrade and commander of\r\nher children--the help-meet and friend of her husband. She inspires\r\nimmediate confidence whenever she confronts an audience. Mrs.\r\nWashburn is also an attractive and large-hearted woman--a\r\n\"Granger,\" and thus experienced in united, organized action of men\r\nand women for furthering the interests of both. Mrs. Hanna, a tall,\r\ngraceful blonde, more reserved in speech but entirely intelligent\r\nin faith and in labor, represented to many men of the convention\r\nthe very qualities they liked in their own wives.\r\n\r\n[489] _President_, Dr. Alida C.

This great event in the history of\r\nhuman progress transpired in 1869.\r\n\r\nNeither the point nor the period for this experiment could have\r\nbeen more fitly chosen. Midway across this vast western continent,\r\non the highest plane of land, rising from three to eight thousand\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, where gigantic mountain-peaks\r\nshooting still higher seem to touch the clouds, while at their feet\r\nflow the great rivers that traverse the State in all directions,\r\nemptying themselves after weary wanderings into the Pacific ocean\r\nat last; such was the grand point where woman was first crowned\r\nwith the rights of citizenship. And the period was equally marked.\r\nTo reach the goal of self-government the women of England and\r\nAmerica seemed to be vieing with each other in the race, now one\r\nholding the advance position, now the other. And in many respects\r\ntheir struggles and failures were similar. When seeking the\r\nadvantages of collegiate education, the women of England were\r\ncompelled to go to France, Austria and Switzerland for the\r\nopportunities they could not enjoy in their own country. The women\r\nof our Eastern States followed their example, or went to Western\r\ninstitutions for such privileges, granted by Oberlin and Antioch in\r\nOhio, Ann Arbor in Michigan, Washington University in Missouri, and\r\nrefused in all the colleges of the East. For long years, alike they\r\nendured ridicule and bitter persecution to secure a foothold in\r\ntheir universities at home.\r\n\r\nOur battles in Parliament and in the Congress of the United States\r\nwere simultaneous. While nine senators,[491] staunch and true,\r\nvoted in favor of woman suffrage in 1866, and women were rolling up\r\ntheir petitions for a constitutional amendment in '68 and '69, with\r\nSamuel C. Pomeroy in the Senate and George W. Julian in the House,\r\nthe women of England, keeping step and time, found their champions\r\nin the House of Commons in John Stuart Mill and Jacob Bright in\r\n1867-69, and no sooner were their mammoth petitions presented in\r\nparliament than ours were rolled into the halls of congress. At\r\nlast we reached the goal, the women of England in 1869 and those of\r\nWyoming in 1870. But what the former gained in time the latter far\r\nsurpassed in privilege. While to the English woman only a limited\r\nsuffrage was accorded, in the vast territory of Wyoming, larger\r\nthan all Great Britain, all the rights of citizenship were fully\r\nand freely conferred by one act of the legislature--the right to\r\nvote at all elections on all questions and to hold any office in\r\nthe gift of the people.\r\n\r\nThe successive steps by which this was accomplished are given us by\r\nHon. J. W. Kingman, associate-justice in the territory for several\r\nyears:\r\n\r\n     It is now sixteen years since the act was passed giving women the\r\n     right to vote at all elections in this territory, including all\r\n     the rights of an elector, with the right to hold office. The\r\n     language of the statute is broad, and beyond the reach of\r\n     evasion. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n          That every woman of the age of twenty-one years, residing in\r\n          the territory, may, at every election to be holden under the\r\n          laws thereof, cast her vote; and her rights to the elective\r\n          franchise, and to hold office, shall be the same, under the\r\n          election laws of the territory, as those of the electors.\r\n\r\n     There was no half-way work about it, no quibbling, no grudgingly\r\n     parting with political power, no fear of consequences, but a\r\n     manly acknowledgment of equal rights and equal privileges, among\r\n     all the citizens of the new territory. Nor was this the only act\r\n     of that first legislature on the subject of equal rights. They\r\n     passed the following:\r\n\r\n          AN ACT _to protect married women in their separate property,\r\n          and the enjoyment of their labor._\r\n\r\n          SECTION 1. That all the property, both real and personal,\r\n          belonging to any married woman as her sole and separate\r\n          property, or which any woman hereafter married, owns at the\r\n          time of her marriage, or which any married woman during\r\n          coverture acquires in good faith from any person other than\r\n          her husband, by descent or otherwise, together with all the\r\n          rents, issues, increase and profits thereof, shall,\r\n          notwithstanding her marriage, be and remain during\r\n          coverture, her sole and separate property, under her sole\r\n          control, and be held, owned, possessed and enjoyed by her,\r\n          the same as though she were sole and unmarried, and shall\r\n          not be subject to the disposal, control or interference of\r\n          her husband, and shall be exempt from execution or\r\n          attachment for the debts of her husband.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 2. Any married woman may bargain, sell, and convey, her\r\n          personal property, and enter into any contract in reference\r\n          to the same, as if she were _sole_.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 3. Any woman may, while married, sue and be sued in all\r\n          matters having relation to her property, person or\r\n          reputation, in the same manner as if she were _sole_.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 4. Any married woman may, while married, make a will\r\n          the same as though she were _sole_.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 5. Any married woman may carry on any trade or\r\n          business, and perform any labor or service on her sole and\r\n          separate account, and the earnings of any married woman from\r\n          her trade, business, labor or services, shall be her sole\r\n          and separate property, and may be used and invested by her\r\n          in her own name; and she may sue and be sued, as if _sole_,\r\n          in regard to her trade, business, labor, services, and\r\n          earnings. * * *\r\n\r\n          SEC. 9. The separate deed of the husband shall convey no\r\n          interest in the wife's lands.\r\n\r\n     Under the statute for distributions, the wife is treated exactly\r\n     as the husband is; each having the same right in the estate of\r\n     the other. The provisions are so unusual and peculiar, that I\r\n     venture to copy some of them:\r\n\r\n          * * * * If such intestate leave a husband or wife, _and_\r\n          children, him or her surviving, one-half of such estate\r\n          shall descend to such surviving husband or wife, and the\r\n          residue thereof * * * * to the children; if such intestate\r\n          leave a husband or wife and _no_ child, * * * * then the\r\n          property shall descend as follows, to wit: three-fourths\r\n          thereof to such remaining husband or wife, and one-fourth\r\n          thereof to the father and mother of the intestate, or the\r\n          survivor of them; provided that if the estate of such\r\n          intestate, real and personal, does not exceed in volume the\r\n          sum of ten thousand dollars, then the whole thereof shall\r\n          descend to and rest in the surviving husband or wife as his\r\n          or her absolute estate. Dower and the tenancy by the curtesy\r\n          are abolished.\r\n\r\n     The school law also provides:\r\n\r\n          SEC. 9. In the employment of teachers no discrimination\r\n          shall be made, in the question of pay, on account of sex,\r\n          when the persons are equally qualified.\r\n\r\n     Such are some of the radical enactments of the first legislature\r\n     of Wyoming territory in reference to woman's rights; and to a\r\n     person who has grown up under the common law and the usages of\r\n     English-speaking people, they undoubtedly appear extravagant if\r\n     not revolutionary, and well calculated to disturb or overthrow\r\n     the very foundations of social order. Experience has not,\r\n     however, justified any such apprehensions. The people of Wyoming\r\n     have prospered under these laws, and are growing to like them\r\n     better and better, and adapt themselves more and more to their\r\n     provisions. The object of this sketch is to trace the progress\r\n     and development of this new legislation, and gather up some of\r\n     its consequences as they have been observed in our social and\r\n     political relations.\r\n\r\n     The territory of Wyoming was first organized in May, 1869. The\r\n     Union Pacific railroad was completed on the 9th of the month, and\r\n     the transcontinental route opened to the public. There were but\r\n     few people in the territory at that time, except such as had been\r\n     brought hither in connection with the building of that road, and\r\n     while some of them were good people, well-educated, and came to\r\n     stay, many were reckless, wicked and wandering. The first\r\n     election was held in September, 1869, for the election of a\r\n     delegate in congress, and members of the Council and House of\r\n     Representatives for the first territorial legislature. There was\r\n     a good deal of party feeling developed, and election day\r\n     witnessed a sharp and vigorous struggle. The candidates and their\r\n     friends spent money freely, and every liquor shop was thrown open\r\n     to all who would drink. I was about to say that any one could\r\n     imagine the consequences; but in fact I do not believe that any\r\n     one could picture to himself the mad follies, and frightful\r\n     scenes of that drunken election. Peaceful people did not dare to\r\n     walk the streets, in some of the towns, during the latter part of\r\n     the day and evening. At South Pass City, some drunken fellows\r\n     with large knives and loaded revolvers swaggered around the\r\n     polls, and swore that no negro should vote. One man remarked\r\n     quietly that he thought the negroes had as good a right to vote\r\n     as any of them had. He was immediately knocked down, jumped on,\r\n     kicked and pounded without mercy, and would have been killed, had\r\n     not his friends rushed into the brutal crowd and dragged him out,\r\n     bloody and insensible. It was a long time before the poor fellow\r\n     recovered from his injuries. There were quite a number of colored\r\n     men who wanted to vote, but did not dare approach the polls until\r\n     the United States Marshal placed himself at their head and with\r\n     revolver in hand escorted them through the crowd, saying he would\r\n     shoot the first man that interfered with them. There was much\r\n     quarreling and tumult, but the negroes voted. This was only a\r\n     sample of the day's doings, and characteristic of the election\r\n     all over the territory. The result was that every Republican was\r\n     defeated, and every Democratic candidate elected; and the whisky\r\n     shops had shown themselves to be the ruling power in Wyoming.\r\n     From such an inspiration one could hardly expect a revelation of\r\n     much value! Yet there were some fair men among those elected.\r\n\r\n     The legislature met October 12, 1869. Wm. H. Bright was elected\r\n     president of the Council. As he was the author of the woman\r\n     suffrage bill, and did more than all others to secure its\r\n     passage, some account of him may be of interest. He was a man of\r\n     much energy and of good natural endowments, but entirely without\r\n     school education. He said frankly, \"I have never been to school a\r\n     day in my life, and where I learned to read and write I do not\r\n     know.\" His character was not above reproach, but he had an\r\n     excellent, well-informed wife, and he was a kind, indulgent\r\n     husband. In fact, he venerated his wife, and submitted to her\r\n     judgment and influence more willingly than one could have\r\n     supposed; and she was in favor of woman suffrage.[492] There were\r\n     a few other men in that legislature, whose wives exercised a\r\n     similar influence; but Mr. Bright found it up-hill work to get a\r\n     majority for his bill, and it dragged along until near the close\r\n     of the session. The character of the arguments he used, and the\r\n     means he employed to win success are perhaps worthy of notice, as\r\n     showing the men he had to deal with. I ought to say distinctly,\r\n     that Mr. Bright was himself fully and firmly convinced of the\r\n     justice and policy of his bill, and gave his whole energy and\r\n     influence to secure its passage; he secured some members by\r\n     arguing to support their pet schemes in return, and some he won\r\n     over by even less creditable means. He got some votes by\r\n     admitting that the governor would veto the bill (and it was\r\n     generally understood that he would), insisting at the same time,\r\n     that it would give the Democrats an advantage in future elections\r\n     by showing that they were in favor of liberal measures while the\r\n     Republican governor and the Republican party were opposed to\r\n     them. The favorite argument, however, and by far the most\r\n     effective, was this: it would prove a great advertisement, would\r\n     make a great deal of talk, and attract attention to the\r\n     legislature, and the territory, more effectually than anything\r\n     else. The bill was finally passed and sent to the governor. I\r\n     must add, however, that many letters were written from different\r\n     parts of the territory, and particularly by the women, to members\r\n     of the legislature, urging its passage and approving its object.\r\n\r\n     On receipt of the bill, the governor was in great doubt what\r\n     course to take. He was inclined to veto it, and had so expressed\r\n     himself; but he did not like to take the responsibility of\r\n     offending the women in the territory, or of placing the\r\n     Republican party in open hostility to a measure which he saw\r\n     might become of political force and importance. I remember well\r\n     an interview that Chief-Justice Howe and myself had with him at\r\n     that time, in which we discussed the policy of the bill, and both\r\n     of us urged him to sign it with all the arguments we could\r\n     command. After a protracted consultation we left him still\r\n     doubtful what he would do.[493] But in the end he signed it, and\r\n     drew upon himself the bitter curses of those Democrats who had\r\n     voted for the bill with the expectation that he would veto it.\r\n     From this time onward, the measure became rather a Republican\r\n     than a Democratic principle, and found more of its friends in the\r\n     former party, and more of its enemies in the latter.\r\n\r\n     Soon after the passage of the bill, a vacancy occurred in the\r\n     office of justice of the peace, at South Pass City, the county\r\n     seat of Sweetwater county, and the home of Mr. Bright and of Mrs.\r\n     Esther Morris. At the request of the county attorney--who favored\r\n     woman suffrage--the commissioners, two of whom also approved of\r\n     it, appointed Mrs. Morris to fill the vacancy. The legislature\r\n     had vested the appointment of officers, in case of a vacancy, in\r\n     the county commissioners, but the organic act of congress,\r\n     creating the territory, provided that the governor \"shall\r\n     commission all officers who shall be appointed under the laws of\r\n     said territory.\" Governor Campbell being absent from the\r\n     territory at the time, the secretary, acting as governor, sent\r\n     Mrs. Morris her commission. It is due to Secretary Lee to say\r\n     that he was an earnest advocate of woman's enfranchisement, and\r\n     labored for the passage of the bill, and gladly embraced the\r\n     opportunity to confirm a woman in office. The important fact is,\r\n     however, that Mrs. Morris' neighbors first suggested the\r\n     appointment that secured her the office, and manfully sustained\r\n     her during her whole term. She tried between thirty and forty\r\n     cases, and decided them so acceptably that not one of them was\r\n     appealed to a higher court; and I know of no one who has held the\r\n     office of justice of the peace in this territory, who has left a\r\n     more acceptable record, in all respects, than has Mrs. Esther\r\n     Morris. Some other appointments of women to office were made, but\r\n     I do not find that any of them entered upon its duties.\r\n\r\n     The first term of the District Court, under the statutes passed\r\n     by the first legislature, was to be held at Laramie City, on the\r\n     first Monday of March, 1870. When the jurors were drawn, a large\r\n     number of women were selected, for both grand and petit jurors.\r\n     As this was not done by the friends of woman suffrage, there was\r\n     evidently an intention of making the whole subject odious and\r\n     ridiculous, and giving it a death-blow at the outset. A great\r\n     deal of feeling was excited among the people, and some effort\r\n     made to prejudice the women against acting as jurors, and even\r\n     threats, ridicule and abuse, in some cases, were indulged in.\r\n     Their husbands were more pestered and badgered than the women,\r\n     and some of them were so much inflamed that they declared they\r\n     would never live with their wives again if they served on the\r\n     jury. The fact that women were drawn as jurors was telegraphed\r\n     all over the country, and the newspapers came loaded with hostile\r\n     and uncomplimentary criticisms. At this stage of the case Col.\r\n     Downey, the prosecuting attorney for the county, wrote to Judge\r\n     Howe for advice and direction as to the eligibility of the women\r\n     as jurors, and what course should be taken in the premises. At\r\n     first Judge Howe was much inclined to order the women discharged,\r\n     and new juries drawn; and it certainly required no small amount\r\n     of moral courage to face the storm of ridicule and abuse that was\r\n     blowing from all quarters. We had a long consultation, and came\r\n     to the conclusion that since the law had clearly given all the\r\n     rights of electors to the women of the territory, they must be\r\n     protected in the exercise of these rights if they chose to assume\r\n     them; that under no circumstances could the judges permit popular\r\n     clamor to deprive the women of their legal rights in the very\r\n     presence of the courts themselves. The result was that Judge Howe\r\n     wrote the county attorney the following letter:\r\n\r\n                                        CHEYENNE, March 3, 1870.\r\n\r\n          S. W. DOWNEY--_My Dear Sir_: I have your favor of yesterday,\r\n          and have carefully considered the question of the\r\n          eligibility of women who are \"citizens,\" to serve on juries.\r\n          Mr. Justice Kingman has also considered the question, and we\r\n          concur in the opinion that such women are eligible. My\r\n          reason for this opinion will be given at length, if occasion\r\n          requires. I will thank you to make it known to those ladies\r\n          who have been summoned on the juries, that they will be\r\n          received, protected, and treated with all the respect and\r\n          courtesy due, and ever paid, by true American gentlemen to\r\n          true American ladies, and that the Court, in all the power\r\n          of government, will secure to them all that deference,\r\n          security from insult, or anything which ought to offend the\r\n          most refined woman, which is accorded in any walks of life\r\n          in which the good and true women of our country have\r\n          heretofore been accustomed to move. Thus, whatever may have\r\n          been, or may now be thought of the policy of admitting women\r\n          to the right of suffrage and to hold office, they will have\r\n          a fair opportunity, at least in my Court, to demonstrate\r\n          their ability in this new field, and prove the policy or\r\n          impolicy of occupying it. Of their right to try it I have no\r\n          doubt. I hope they will succeed, and the Court will\r\n          certainly aid them in all lawful and proper ways. Very\r\n          respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                   J. H. HOWE, _Chief-Justice_.\r\n\r\n     When the time came to hold the court, Judge Howe, whose duty it\r\n     was to preside, requested me to go with him to Laramie City, and\r\n     sit with him during the term. I gladly availed myself of the\r\n     opportunity. As soon as we arrived there, Judge Howe was waited\r\n     on by a number of gentlemen who endeavored to induce him to order\r\n     the discharge of the female jurors without calling them into\r\n     court. Some spoke of the impolicy of the proceeding, and said the\r\n     women all objected to it and wished to be excused; while some\r\n     were cross, and demanded the discharge of their wives, saying\r\n     that it was an intentional insult and they would not submit to\r\n     it. But Judge Howe told them all firmly, that the women must come\r\n     into court, and if, after the whole question was fairly explained\r\n     to them, they chose to decline, they should be excused. At the\r\n     opening of the court next morning, the house was crowded, and the\r\n     female jurors were all there. After the usual preliminaries, an\r\n     attorney arose and moved that all the women summoned as jurors be\r\n     excused, saying he made the motion at the request of the women\r\n     themselves; and that he was assured they did not wish to serve.\r\n     Judge Howe then requested me to express my opinion and make some\r\n     remarks to the women on the duties devolving on them. I said:\r\n\r\n          It was a real pleasure to me to see ladies in the\r\n          court-room, with the right to take a responsible part in the\r\n          proceedings, as grand and petit jurors; that no one knew so\r\n          well as they did, the evils our community suffered from\r\n          lawless and wicked people; and no one better understood the\r\n          difficulties the court labored under in its efforts to\r\n          administer justice and punish crime; that the time had come\r\n          when the good women of the territory could give us\r\n          substantial aid, and we looked to them especially, as the\r\n          power which should make the court efficient in the discharge\r\n          of its duties; that the new law had conferred on them\r\n          important rights, and corresponding duties necessarily\r\n          devolved upon them; that I hoped and believed they would not\r\n          shrink when so many influences were calling on them for\r\n          noble and worthy action; that if they failed us now, the\r\n          cause of equal rights would suffer at their hands, not only\r\n          in our territory, but in every land where its advocates were\r\n          struggling for its recognition; that if they would remain,\r\n          their presence would secure a degree of decorum in the\r\n          court-room and add a dignity to the proceedings, which the\r\n          judges had been unable to command; that we required the\r\n          assistance of good women all over the territory, and I\r\n          begged them to help us.\r\n\r\n     Judge Howe then spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n          It is an innovation and a great novelty to see, as we do\r\n          to-day, ladies summoned to serve as jurors. The extension of\r\n          political rights and franchise to women is a subject that is\r\n          agitating the whole country. I have never taken an active\r\n          part in these discussions, but I have long seen that woman\r\n          is a victim to the vices, crimes and immoralities of man,\r\n          with no power to protect and defend herself from these\r\n          evils. I have long felt that such powers of protection\r\n          should be conferred upon woman, and it has fallen to our lot\r\n          here to act as the pioneers in the movement and to test the\r\n          question. The eyes of the whole world are to-day fixed upon\r\n          this jury of Albany county. There is not the slightest\r\n          impropriety in any lady occupying this position, and I wish\r\n          to assure you that the fullest protection of the court shall\r\n          be accorded to you. It would be a most shameful scandal that\r\n          in our temple of justice and in our courts of law, anything\r\n          should be permitted which the most sensitive lady might not\r\n          hear with propriety and witness. And here let me add that it\r\n          will be a sorry day for any man who shall so far forget the\r\n          courtesy due and paid by every American gentleman to every\r\n          American lady as to ever by word or act endeavor to deter\r\n          you from the exercise of those rights with which the law has\r\n          invested you. I conclude with the remark that this is a\r\n          question for you to decide for yourselves. No man has any\r\n          right to interfere. It seems to me to be eminently proper\r\n          for women to sit upon grand juries, which will give them the\r\n          best possible opportunities to aid in suppressing the dens\r\n          of infamy which curse the country. I shall be glad of your\r\n          assistance in the accomplishment of this object. I do not\r\n          make these remarks from distrust of any of the gentlemen. On\r\n          the contrary, I am exceedingly pleased and gratified with\r\n          the indication of intelligence, love of law and good order,\r\n          and the gentlemanly deportment which I see manifested here.\r\n\r\n     The ladies were then told that those who could not conveniently\r\n     serve, and those who insisted on being excused, might rise and\r\n     they should be discharged. Only one rose and she was excused. But\r\n     a victory had been won of no small moment. Seeing the earnestness\r\n     of the judges and the dignified character they had given to the\r\n     affair, the women were encouraged and pleased, and the enemies of\r\n     equal rights, who had planned, as they thought, a stunning blow\r\n     to further progress, were silenced and defeated. The current set\r\n     rapidly in the other direction and applause, as usual, followed\r\n     success. The business of the court proceeded with marked\r\n     improvement. The court-room, always crowded, was quiet and\r\n     decorous in the extreme. The bar in particular was always on its\r\n     good behavior, and wrangling, abuse and buncome speeches were\r\n     not heard. When men moved about they walked quietly, on tip-toe,\r\n     so as to make no noise, and forbore to whisper or make any\r\n     demonstrations in or around the court-room. The women when called\r\n     took their chairs in the jury-box with the men, as they do their\r\n     seats in church,[494] and no annoyance or reluctance was visible\r\n     from the bench. They gave close and intelligent attention to the\r\n     details of every case, and the men who sat with them evidently\r\n     acted with more conscientious care than usual. The verdicts were\r\n     generally satisfactory, except to convicted criminals. They did\r\n     not convict every one they tried, but \"no guilty man escaped,\" if\r\n     there was sufficient evidence to hold him. The lawyers soon found\r\n     out that the usual tricks and subterfuges in criminal cases would\r\n     not procure acquittal, and they began to challenge off all the\r\n     women called. The court checkmated this move by directing the\r\n     sheriff to summon other women in their places, instead of men,\r\n     and then came motions for continuances. The result was a great\r\n     success and was so acknowledged by all disinterested persons. On\r\n     the grand jury were six women and nine men, and they became such\r\n     a terror to evil-doers that a stampede began among them and very\r\n     many left the town forever. Certainly there was never more\r\n     fearless or efficient work performed by a grand jury.\r\n\r\n     The legislature copied most of the statutes which it enacted from\r\n     the laws of Nebraska, and among others the following clauses in\r\n     the crimes act, to wit.:\r\n\r\n          If any person shall keep open any tippling or gaming-house\r\n          on the Sabbath day or night, * * * he shall be fined not\r\n          exceeding one hundred dollars, or imprisoned in the county\r\n          jail not exceeding six months.\r\n\r\n          Any person who shall hereafter knowingly disturb the peace\r\n          and good order of society by labor on the first day of the\r\n          week, commonly called Sunday (works of necessity and charity\r\n          excepted), shall be fined, on conviction thereof, in any sum\r\n          not exceeding fifty dollars.\r\n\r\n     No attention whatever had been paid to these statutes, and Sunday\r\n     was generally the great drinking day of the whole week; the\r\n     saloons sold more whiskey and made more money that day than any\r\n     other. The women on that grand jury determined to put a stop to\r\n     it and enforce these laws. They therefore indicted every liquor\r\n     saloon in town. This made a great outcry, not only among the\r\n     liquor-sellers but among their customers also. They were all\r\n     arrested, brought into court and gave bail; but Judge Howe told\r\n     them as this was a new law recently passed, and as it was quite\r\n     probable that most of them were ignorant of its provisions, he\r\n     would continue the cases with this express understanding, that if\r\n     they would strictly obey the law in future these cases should be\r\n     dismissed; but if any of them violated it, these cases would be\r\n     tried and the full penalty inflicted. They all agreed to this,\r\n     and the \"Sunday Law,\" as it was called, was carefully observed\r\n     afterwards in Laramie City; and so great has been the change in\r\n     that town in the habits of the people and the quiet appearance of\r\n     the streets on Sunday, as compared with other towns in the\r\n     territory, that it has been nick-named the \"Puritan town\" of\r\n     Wyoming, and, I may add, rejoices in its singularity.\r\n\r\n     And how was this most successful experiment in equal rights\r\n     received and treated by the press and the people out of the\r\n     territory? The New York illustrated papers made themselves funny\r\n     with caricatures of female juries, and cheap scribblers invented\r\n     all sorts of scandals and misrepresentations about them. The\r\n     newspapers were overflowing with abuse and adverse criticism, and\r\n     only here and there was a manly voice heard in apology or\r\n     defense. I copy these extracts as a sample of the rest.\r\n\r\n     \"LADY JURORS.\"--Under this head the New Orleans _Times_, the\r\n     ablest and largest paper in the South, said:\r\n\r\n          Confusion is becoming worse confounded by the hurried march\r\n          of events. Mad theorizings take the form of every-day\r\n          realities, and in the confusion of rights and the confusion\r\n          of dress, all distinctions of sex are threatened with swift\r\n          obliteration. When Anna Dickinson holds forth as the teacher\r\n          of strange doctrines in which the masculinity of woman is\r\n          preposterously asserted as a true warrant for equality with\r\n          man in all his political and industrial relations; when\r\n          Susan B. Anthony flashes defiance from lips and eyes which\r\n          refuse the blandishment and soft dalliance that in the past\r\n          have been so potent with \"the sex\"; when, in fine, the women\r\n          of Wyoming are called from their domestic firesides to serve\r\n          as jurors in a court of justice, a question of the day, and\r\n          one, too, of the strangest kind, is forced on our attention.\r\n          From a careful review of all the surroundings, we think the\r\n          Wyoming experiment will lead to beneficial results. By\r\n          proving that lady jurors are altogether impracticable--that\r\n          they cannot sit as the peers of men without setting at\r\n          defiance all the laws of delicacy and propriety--the\r\n          conclusion may be reached that it will be far better to let\r\n          nature alone in regulating the relations of the sexes.\r\n\r\n     The Philadelphia _Press_ had the following:\r\n\r\n          WOMEN AS JURORS.--Now one of the adjuncts of female\r\n          citizenship is about to be tested in Wyoming. Eleven women\r\n          have been drawn as jurors to serve at the March term of the\r\n          Albany County Court. It is stated that immense excitement\r\n          has been created thereby, but the nature of the aforesaid\r\n          excitement does not transpire. Will women revolutionize\r\n          justice? What is female justice, or what is it likely to be?\r\n          Would twelve women return the same verdict as twelve men,\r\n          supposing that each twelve had heard the same case? Is it\r\n          possible for a jury of women, carrying with them all their\r\n          sensitiveness, sympathies, predilections, jealousies,\r\n          prejudices, hatreds, to reach an impartial verdict? Would\r\n          not every criminal be a monster, provided not a female? Can\r\n          the sex, ordinarily so quick to pronounce pre-judgments,\r\n          divest itself of them sufficiently to enter the jury-box\r\n          with unbiased minds? Perhaps it were best to trust the\r\n          answer to events. Women may learn to be jurymen, but in so\r\n          doing they have a great deal to learn.\r\n\r\n     So persistent were the attacks and so malignant were the\r\n     perversions of truth that Judge Howe, at the request of the\r\n     editor, wrote the following letter for publication anonymously in\r\n     the Chicago _Legal News_, every statement in which I can confirm\r\n     from my own observation. The Judge, after writing the letter,\r\n     consented to its publication over his own signature:\r\n\r\n                                   CHEYENNE, Wyoming, April 4, 1870.\r\n\r\n          _Mrs. Myra Bradwell, Chicago, Ill.:_\r\n\r\n          DEAR MADAM: I am in receipt of your favor of March 26, in\r\n          which you request me to \"give you a truthful statement, over\r\n          my own signature, for publication in your paper, of the\r\n          history of, and my observations in regard to, women as grand\r\n          and petit jurors in Wyoming.\" I will comply with your\r\n          request, with this qualification, that it be not published\r\n          over my own signature, as I do not covet newspaper\r\n          publicity, and have already, without any agency or fault of\r\n          my own, been subjected to an amount of it which I never\r\n          anticipated nor conceived of, and which has been far from\r\n          agreeable to me.\r\n\r\n          I had no agency in the enactment of the law in Wyoming\r\n          conferring legal equality upon women. I found it upon the\r\n          statute-book of that territory, and in accordance with its\r\n          provisions several women were legally drawn by the proper\r\n          officers on the grand and petit juries of Albany county, and\r\n          were duly summoned by the sheriff without any agency of\r\n          mine. On being apprised of these facts, I conceived it to be\r\n          my plain duty to fairly enforce this law, as I would any\r\n          other; and more than this, I resolved at once that, as it\r\n          had fallen to my lot to have the experiment tried under my\r\n          administration, it should have a fair trial, and I therefore\r\n          assured these women that they could serve or not, as they\r\n          chose; that if they chose to serve, the Court would secure\r\n          to them the most respectful consideration and deference, and\r\n          protect them from insult in word or gesture, and from\r\n          everything which might offend a modest and virtuous woman in\r\n          any of the walks of life in which the good and true women of\r\n          our country have been accustomed to move.\r\n\r\n          While I had never been an advocate for the law, I felt that\r\n          thousands of good men and women had been, and that they had\r\n          a right to see it fairly administered; and I was resolved\r\n          that it should not be sneered down if I had to employ the\r\n          whole power of the court to prevent it. I felt that even\r\n          those who were opposed to the policy of admitting women to\r\n          the right of suffrage and to hold office would condemn me if\r\n          I did not do this. It was also sufficient for me that my own\r\n          judgment approved this course.\r\n\r\n          With such assurances these women chose to serve and were\r\n          duly impanelled as jurors. They were educated, cultivated\r\n          eastern ladies, who are an honor to their sex. They have,\r\n          with true womanly devotion, left their homes of comfort in\r\n          the States to share the fortunes of their husbands and\r\n          brothers in the far West and to aid them in founding a new\r\n          State beyond the Missouri.\r\n\r\n          And now as to the results. With all my prejudices against\r\n          the policy, I am under conscientious obligations to say that\r\n          these women acquitted themselves with such dignity, decorum,\r\n          propriety of conduct and intelligence as to win the\r\n          admiration of every fair-minded citizen of Wyoming. They\r\n          were careful, pains-taking, intelligent and conscientious.\r\n          They were firm and resolute for the right as established by\r\n          the law and the testimony. Their verdicts were right, and,\r\n          after three or four criminal trials, the lawyers engaged in\r\n          defending persons accused of crime began to avail themselves\r\n          of the right of peremptory challenge to get rid of the\r\n          female jurors, who were too much in favor of enforcing the\r\n          laws and punishing crime to suit the interests of their\r\n          clients. After the grand jury had been in session two days,\r\n          the dance-house keepers, gamblers and _demi-monde_ fled out\r\n          of the city in dismay, to escape the indictment of women\r\n          grand jurors! In short I have never, in twenty-five years of\r\n          constant experience in the courts of the country, seen more\r\n          faithful, intelligent and resolutely honest grand and petit\r\n          juries than these.\r\n\r\n          A contemptibly lying and silly dispatch went over the wires\r\n          to the effect that during the trial of A. W. Howie for\r\n          homicide (in which the jury consisted of six women and six\r\n          men) the men and women were kept locked up together all\r\n          night for four nights. Only two nights intervened during the\r\n          trial, and on these nights, by my order, the jury was taken\r\n          to the parlor of the large, commodious and well-furnished\r\n          hotel of the Union Pacific Railroad, in charge of the\r\n          sheriff and a woman bailiff, where they were supplied with\r\n          meals and every comfort, and at 10 o'clock the women were\r\n          conducted by the bailiff to a large and suitable apartment\r\n          where beds were prepared for them, and the men to another\r\n          adjoining, where beds were prepared for them, and where they\r\n          remained in charge of sworn officers until morning, when\r\n          they were again all conducted to the parlor and from thence\r\n          in a body to breakfast, and thence to the jury-room, which\r\n          was a clean and comfortable one, carpeted and heated, and\r\n          furnished with all proper conveniences.\r\n\r\n          The cause was submitted to the jury for their decision about\r\n          11 o'clock in the forenoon, and they agreed upon their\r\n          verdict, which was received by the court between 11 and 12\r\n          o'clock at night of the same day, when they were discharged.\r\n\r\n          Everybody commended the conduct of this jury and was\r\n          satisfied with the verdict, except the individual who was\r\n          convicted of murder in the second degree. The presence of\r\n          these ladies in court secured the most perfect decorum and\r\n          propriety of conduct, and the gentlemen of the bar and\r\n          others vied with each other in their courteous and\r\n          respectful demeanor toward the ladies and the court. Nothing\r\n          occurred to offend the most refined lady (if she was a\r\n          sensible lady) and the universal judgment of every\r\n          intelligent and fair-minded man present was and is, that the\r\n          experiment was a success.\r\n\r\n          I dislike the notoriety this matter has given me, but I do\r\n          not shrink from it. I never sought it nor expected it, and\r\n          have only performed what I regarded as a plain duty, neither\r\n          seeking nor desiring any praise, and quite indifferent to\r\n          any censure or criticism which my conduct may have invoked.\r\n\r\n          Thanking you for your friendly and complimentary\r\n          expressions, I am very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                             J. H. HOWE.\r\n\r\n     As showing how the matter was received at home, in Laramie City,\r\n     I copy the following from the _Laramie Sentinel_ of April 7,\r\n     1870:\r\n\r\n          If we should neglect to give some idea of the results of our\r\n          jury experiment, the world would say we were afraid or\r\n          ashamed of it. For our own part we are inclined to admit\r\n          that it succeeded beyond all our expectations. We naturally\r\n          wished it to succeed; still we scarcely wished it to\r\n          demonstrate a theory that women were better qualified for\r\n          these duties than men. Hence, when Chief-Justice Howe said,\r\n          \"In eighteen years' experience I have never had as fair,\r\n          candid, impartial and able a jury in court, as in this term\r\n          in Albany county,\" and when Associate-Justice Kingman said,\r\n          \"For twenty-five years it has been an anxious study with me,\r\n          both on the bench and at the bar, how we are to prevent jury\r\n          trials from degenerating into a perfect burlesque, and it\r\n          has remained for Albany county to point out the remedy and\r\n          demonstrate the cure for this threatened evil,\" we confess\r\n          to having been _more_ than satisfied with the result. It may\r\n          be safely stated as the unanimous verdict of bench, bar and\r\n          public opinion, that the jurors of Albany county did well\r\n          and faithfully discharge their duties, with honor and credit\r\n          to themselves and to the satisfaction of the public.\r\n\r\n     Among the few exceptions to the general abuse of the press, the\r\n     following from the Cincinnati _Gazette_ of April 14, 1870, is\r\n     well worth preserving:\r\n\r\n          Now, in the name of the inalienable right of every person to\r\n          the pursuit of happiness, we have to ask: Are not these\r\n          women competent to decide for themselves whether their\r\n          households, their children or their husbands are of more\r\n          importance than their public duties? And having the best\r\n          means for deciding this question, have they not the right to\r\n          decide? Who has the right to pick out the females of a jury\r\n          and challenge them with the question whether they are not\r\n          neglecting their households or their husbands? Who\r\n          challenges a male juror and demands whether he left his\r\n          family well provided, and his wife well cherished? or if,\r\n          through his detention in court, the cupboard will be bare,\r\n          the wife neglected, or the children with holes in their\r\n          trousers? This is simply the crack of the familiar whip of\r\n          man's absolute domination over women. It means nothing short\r\n          of their complete subjection. Not to use rights is to\r\n          abandon them. There are inconveniences and cares in all\r\n          possessions; but who argues that therefore they should be\r\n          abandoned? It would much promote the convenience of man if\r\n          he would let his political rights and duties be performed by\r\n          a few willing persons; but he would soon find that he had no\r\n          rights left.\r\n\r\n          And what is this family impediment which is thus set up as a\r\n          female disability? The family obligation is just as strong\r\n          in man as in woman. It is much stronger, for the manners\r\n          which compel woman to be the passive waiter on the male\r\n          providence leave to him the real responsibility. Yet many\r\n          men forego marriage and homes and children, and nobody\r\n          imagines that it disqualifies them for public duties. Nobody\r\n          challenges them as jurors, and demands if they have\r\n          discharged the family obligation. Rather it is held wise in\r\n          them to give themselves wholly to their pursuits, without\r\n          the distraction of conjugal joys, until they have achieved\r\n          success. Why should the family requirement, which man throws\r\n          off so easily, be made a yoke for woman? There is something\r\n          more fundamental than nursing babies or coddling the\r\n          appetites of husbands. The sentiment, \"Give me liberty, or\r\n          give me death,\" is the American instinct. Breathes there a\r\n          woman with soul so dead that she would bring forth slaves?\r\n          Babes had better not be born if they are not to have their\r\n          rights. It is the duty of women to first provide the state\r\n          of freedom for their progeny. Then they may consent to\r\n          become wives and mothers. Liberty and the exercise of all\r\n          political rights are so bound together, that to neglect one\r\n          is to abandon all. Trial by a jury of one's peers is the\r\n          essential principle of the administration of justice. To be\r\n          a peer on a jury involves the whole principle of equal\r\n          rights. To abandon this to man, is to accept subjection to\r\n          man.\r\n\r\n          For women to neglect jury duty is to give men the exclusive\r\n          privilege to _judge women_, and to abandon the right to be\r\n          tried by a jury of their peers. How can men justly judge a\r\n          woman? They cannot have that knowledge of her peculiar\r\n          physical and mental organization which is requisite to the\r\n          judgment of motives and temptations. They cannot comprehend\r\n          the variable moods and emotions, nor the power of her\r\n          impulses. It is monstrous injustice to judge women by the\r\n          same rules as men. And men lack that intuitive charity and\r\n          tender sympathy which women always feel for an exposed,\r\n          erring sister. Furthermore, many of the crimes of men are\r\n          against women. How can men appreciate their injury? That\r\n          which is her ruin, they call, as Anna Dickinson says, sowing\r\n          their wild oats. How can justice be expected from those who\r\n          instinctively combine to preserve their privilege to abuse\r\n          women? For the administration of justice to women who are\r\n          accused, and to men who have wronged women, judges and\r\n          jurors of their own sex are indispensable.\r\n\r\n     As long as Judge Howe remained on the bench he had women on his\r\n     juries.[495] His first term at Cheyenne, after the law was\r\n     passed, several women were among the jurors, and they did fully\r\n     as well, and exerted quite as good an influence there, as the\r\n     women had recently at Laramie City.\r\n\r\n     The first election under the woman suffrage law was held in\r\n     September 1870, for the election of a delegate in congress, and\r\n     county officers. There was an exciting canvass, and both parties\r\n     applied to the whisky shops, as before, supposing they would\r\n     wield the political power of the territory, and that not enough\r\n     women would vote to influence the result. The morning of election\r\n     came, but did not bring the usual scenes around the polls. A few\r\n     women came out early to vote, and the crowd kept entirely out of\r\n     sight. There was plenty of drinking and noise at the saloons, but\r\n     the men would not remain, after voting, around the polls. It\r\n     seemed more like Sunday than election day. Even the negro men and\r\n     women voted without objection or disturbance. Quite a number of\r\n     women voted during the day, at least in all the larger towns, but\r\n     apprehension of a repetition of the scenes of the former\r\n     election, and doubt as to the proper course for them to pursue,\r\n     kept very many from voting. The result was a great disappointment\r\n     all around. The election had passed off with unexpected quiet,\r\n     and order had everywhere prevailed. The whisky shops had been\r\n     beaten, and their favorite candidate for congress, although he\r\n     had spent several thousand dollars to secure an election, was\r\n     left out in the cold. I cannot deny myself the pleasure of\r\n     quoting at length the following letter of the Rev. D. J. Pierce,\r\n     at that time a resident of Laramie City, and a very wealthy man,\r\n     to show the powerful influence that was exerted on the mind of a\r\n     New England clergyman by that first exhibition of women at the\r\n     polls, and as evidence of the singular and beneficial change in\r\n     the character of the election, and the conduct of the men:\r\n\r\n          _Editor Laramie Sentinel:_ I am pleased to notice your\r\n          action in printing testimonials of different classes to the\r\n          influence of woman suffrage in Wyoming. With the apathy of\r\n          conservatism and prejudice of party spirit arrayed against\r\n          the idea in America, it is the duty of the residents in\r\n          Wyoming to note the simple facts of their noted experiment,\r\n          and lay them before the world for its consideration. I came\r\n          from the vicinity of Boston, arriving in Laramie two weeks\r\n          before the first regular election of 1870. I had never\r\n          sympathized with the extreme theories of the woman's rights\r\n          platform, to the advocates of which I had often listened in\r\n          Boston. But I had never been able to learn just why a woman\r\n          is naturally excluded from the privilege of franchise, and I\r\n          sometimes argued in favor in lyceum debates. Still the\r\n          question of her degradation stared me in the face, and I\r\n          came to Wyoming unsettled in the matter, determined to be an\r\n          impartial judge. I was early at the polls, but too late to\r\n          witness the polling of the first female vote--by \"Grandma\"\r\n          Swain, a much-esteemed Quaker lady of 75 summers, who\r\n          determined by her words and influence to rally her sex to\r\n          defend the cause of morality and justice.\r\n\r\n          I saw the rough mountaineers maintaining the most respectful\r\n          decorum whenever the women approached the polls, and heard\r\n          the timely warning of one of the leading canvassers as he\r\n          silenced an incipient quarrel with uplifted finger, saying,\r\n          \"Hist! Be quiet! A woman is coming!\"\r\n\r\n          And I was compelled to allow that in this new country,\r\n          supposed at that time to be infested by hordes of\r\n          cut-throats, gamblers and abandoned characters, I had\r\n          witnessed a more quiet election than it had been my fortune\r\n          to see in the quiet towns of Vermont. I saw ladies attended\r\n          by their husbands, brothers, or sweethearts, ride to the\r\n          places of voting, and alight in the midst of a silent crowd,\r\n          and pass through an open space to the polls, depositing\r\n          their votes with no more exposure to insult or injury than\r\n          they would expect on visiting a grocery store or\r\n          meat-market. Indeed, they were much safer here, every man of\r\n          their party was pledged to shield them, while every member\r\n          of the other party feared the influence of any signs of\r\n          disrespect.\r\n\r\n          And the next day I sent my impressions to an eastern paper,\r\n          declaring myself convinced that woman's presence at the\r\n          polls would elevate the tone of public sentiment there as it\r\n          does in churches, the social hall, or any other place, while\r\n          her own robes are unspotted by the transient association\r\n          with evil characters which she is daily obliged to meet in\r\n          the street or dry-goods store. My observation at subsequent\r\n          annual elections has only confirmed my opinion in this\r\n          respect.\r\n\r\n          Without reference to party issues, I noticed that a majority\r\n          of women voted for men of the most temperate habits, thus\r\n          insuring success to the party of law and order.\r\n\r\n          After three years' absence from my old home, I could not\r\n          fail to notice in the elections of 1877 and 1878 that both\r\n          parties had been led to nominate men of better standing in\r\n          moral character, in order to secure the female vote.\r\n\r\n          I confess that I believe in the idea of aristocracy--_i. e._\r\n          \"the rule of the best ones\"--not by blood or position, but\r\n          the aristocracy of character, to which our laws point when\r\n          they declare that prison characters shall not vote.\r\n\r\n          The ballot of any community cannot rise above its character.\r\n          A town full of abandoned women would be cursed by the\r\n          application of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n          We need to intrust our State interests to the class most\r\n          noted for true character. As a class, women are more moral\r\n          and upright in their character than men. Hence America would\r\n          profit by their voting.\r\n\r\n                         D. J. PIERCE, _Pastor Baptist Church_.\r\n\r\n     The next general election occurred in September, 1871, for\r\n     members of the second territorial legislature. The usual tactics\r\n     were employed and considerable sums of money were given to the\r\n     drinking saloons to secure their influence and furnish free\r\n     drinks and cigars for the voters. But no one thought of trying to\r\n     buy up the women, nor was it ever supposed that a woman's vote\r\n     could be secured with whiskey and cigars! Election day passed off\r\n     with entire quiet and good order around the polling-places; the\r\n     noise and bustle were confined to the bar-rooms. The streets\r\n     presented no change from an ordinary business day, except that a\r\n     large number of wagons and carriages were driven about with the\r\n     watch-words and banners of different parties, or different\r\n     candidates, conspicuously posted on them. A much larger number of\r\n     women voted at this election than at the former one, but quite a\r\n     number failed or refused to take part in it. The result was again\r\n     a surprise, and to many a disappointment. Some candidates were\r\n     unexpectedly elected, and some who had spent large amounts of\r\n     money and worked hard around the drinking saloons, and were ready\r\n     to bet largely on being elected, were defeated. The Republicans\r\n     had shown an unexpected strength and had returned several members\r\n     to each House, although it was quite certain that some of the\r\n     Democrats were indebted to the women for their success. It was\r\n     admitted, however, that their votes had generally gone against\r\n     the favorites of the whiskey shops and that the power of the\r\n     saloons had been largely neutralized and in some cases entirely\r\n     overthrown. Some remarkable instances of woman's independence and\r\n     moral character occurred at this election which I cannot help\r\n     recording, but must not mention names.\r\n\r\n     As above stated in reference to the grand jury in Laramie City,\r\n     the \"Sunday law\" had there been put into vigorous operation. The\r\n     evening before the election, and after both the political parties\r\n     had nominated their candidates for the legislature, the\r\n     saloon-keepers got together very secretly and nominated a ticket\r\n     of their own number, pledged to repeal the \"Sunday law.\" This\r\n     move was not discovered until they began to vote that ticket at\r\n     the polls next day. Then it was found that the saloons were\r\n     pushing it with all their influence and giving free drinks to all\r\n     who would vote it. This aroused the women and they came out in\r\n     force; many who had declined to vote before not only voted, but\r\n     went round and induced others to do the same. At noon the\r\n     rum-sellers' ticket was far ahead and it looked as though it\r\n     would be elected by a large majority; at the close of the polls\r\n     at night it was overwhelmingly defeated. In one case the wife of\r\n     a saloon-keeper who was a candidate on that ticket, told her\r\n     husband that she would defeat him if she could. He was beaten,\r\n     and he was man enough to say he was glad of it--glad he had a\r\n     wife so much better than he was, and who had so much more\r\n     influence in town than he had.\r\n\r\n     Another candidate on that ticket was a saloon-keeper who had\r\n     grown rich in the traffic, but whose private character was much\r\n     above the morals of his business. He had recently married a very\r\n     nice young lady in the East, and she was much excited when she\r\n     learned how matters were progressing. She told her husband she\r\n     was ashamed of him and would vote against him, and would enlist\r\n     all the members of her church against him if she could; and she\r\n     went to work in earnest and was a most efficient cause of the\r\n     defeat of the ticket. Her husband also was proud of her, and said\r\n     it served him right and he was glad of it. I have never heard\r\n     that the domestic harmony of either of these families was in\r\n     anyway disturbed by these events, but I know that they have\r\n     prospered and are still successful and happy.\r\n\r\n     Still the legislature was strongly Democratic. There were four\r\n     Republicans and five Democrats in the Council, and four\r\n     Republicans and nine Democrats in the House. When they met in\r\n     November, 1871, many Democrats were found to be bitterly opposed\r\n     to woman suffrage and determined to repeal the act; they said it\r\n     was evident they were losing ground and the Republicans gaining\r\n     by reason of the women voting, and that it must be stopped. The\r\n     Republicans were all inclined to sustain the law. Several\r\n     caucuses were held by the Democrats to determine on their course\r\n     of action and overcome the opposition in their own ranks. These\r\n     caucuses were held in one of the largest drinking saloons in\r\n     Cheyenne and all the power of whiskey was brought to bear on the\r\n     members to secure a repeal of the woman suffrage act. It required\r\n     considerable time and a large amount of whiskey, but at last the\r\n     opposition was stifled and the Democratic party was brought up\r\n     solid for repeal. A bill was introduced in the House for the\r\n     purpose, but was warmly resisted by the Republicans and a long\r\n     discussion followed. It was finally carried by a strict party\r\n     vote and sent to the Council, where it met with the same\r\n     opposition and the same result followed. It then went to the\r\n     governor for his approval. There was no doubt in his mind as to\r\n     the course he ought to take. He had seen the effects produced by\r\n     the act of enfranchisement, and unhesitatingly approved all of\r\n     them. He promptly returned the bill with his veto; and the\r\n     accompanying message is such an able paper and so fully sets\r\n     forth the reasons in favor of the original act, and the good\r\n     results of its operation, that at least a few extracts well\r\n     deserve a prominent place in this record:\r\n\r\n          I return herewith to the House of Representatives, in which\r\n          it originated, a bill for \"An Act to repeal Chapter XXXI. of\r\n          the Laws of the First Legislative Assembly of the Territory\r\n          of Wyoming.\"\r\n\r\n          I regret that a sense of duty compels me to dissent from\r\n          your honorable body with regard to any contemplated measure\r\n          of public policy. It would certainly be more in accordance\r\n          with the desire I have to secure and preserve the most\r\n          harmonious relations among all the branches of our\r\n          territorial government, to approve the bill. A regard,\r\n          however, for the rights of those whose interests are to be\r\n          affected by it, and for what I believe to be the best\r\n          interests of the territory, will not allow me to do so. The\r\n          consideration, besides, that the passage of this bill would\r\n          be, on the part of those instrumental in bringing it about,\r\n          a declaration that the principles upon which the\r\n          enfranchisement of women is urged are false and untenable,\r\n          and that our experience demonstrates this, influences me not\r\n          a little in my present action.\r\n\r\n          While I fully appreciate the great danger of too much\r\n          attention to abstract speculation or metaphysical reasoning\r\n          in political affairs, I cannot but perceive that there are\r\n          times and circumstances when it is not only proper but\r\n          absolutely necessary to appeal to principles somewhat\r\n          general and abstract, when they alone can point out the way\r\n          and they alone can guide our conduct. So it was when, two\r\n          years ago, the act which this bill is designed to repeal was\r\n          presented for my approval. There was at that time no\r\n          experience to which I might refer and test by its results\r\n          the conclusions to which the application of certain\r\n          universally admitted principles led me. In the absence of\r\n          all such experience I was driven to the application of\r\n          principles which through the whole course of our national\r\n          history have been powerfully and beneficially operative in\r\n          making our institutions more and more popular, in framing\r\n          laws more and more just and in securing amendments to our\r\n          federal constitution. If the ballot be an expression of the\r\n          wish, or a declaration of the will, of the tax-payer as to\r\n          the manner in which taxes should be levied and collected and\r\n          revenues disbursed, why should those who hold in their own\r\n          right a large proportion of the wealth of the country be\r\n          excluded from a voice in making the laws which regulate this\r\n          whole subject? If, again, the ballot be for the physically\r\n          weak a guarantee of protection against the aggression and\r\n          violence of the strong, upon what ground can the delicate\r\n          bodily organism of woman be forbidden this shelter for her\r\n          protection? If, once more, each ballot be the declaration of\r\n          the individual will of the person casting it, as to the\r\n          relative merit of opposed measures or men, surely the\r\n          ability to judge and determine--the power of choice--does\r\n          not depend upon sex, nor does womanhood deprive of\r\n          personality. If these principles are too general to be free\r\n          from criticism, and if this reasoning be too abstract to be\r\n          always practically applicable, neither the principles nor\r\n          the reasoning can fail of approbation when contrasted with\r\n          the gloomy misgivings for the future and the dark\r\n          forebodings of evils, imaginary, vague and undefined, by\r\n          dwelling upon which the opponents of this reform endeavor to\r\n          stay its progress. Aggressive reasoning and positive\r\n          principles like these must be met with something more than\r\n          mere doubtful conjectures, must be resisted by something\r\n          more than popular prejudices, and overthrown--if overthrown\r\n          at all--by something stronger than the force of inert\r\n          conservatism; yet what is there but conjecture, prejudice\r\n          and conservatism opposing this reform? * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n          The law granting to women the right to vote and to hold\r\n          office in this territory was a natural and logical sequence\r\n          to the other laws upon our statute-book. Our laws give to\r\n          the widow the guardianship of her minor children. Will you\r\n          take from her all voice in relation to the public schools\r\n          established for the education of those children? Our laws\r\n          permit women to acquire and possess property. Will you\r\n          forbid them having any voice in relation to the taxation of\r\n          that property? This bill says too little or too much. Too\r\n          little, if you legislate upon the assumption that woman is\r\n          an inferior who should be kept in a subordinate position,\r\n          for in that case the other laws affecting her should be\r\n          repealed or amended; and too much, if she is, as no one will\r\n          deny, the equal of man in heart and mind, for in that case\r\n          we cannot afford to dispense with her counsel and assistance\r\n          in the government of the territory.\r\n\r\n          I need only instance section 9 of the school act, which\r\n          declares that, \"In the employment of teachers no\r\n          discrimination shall be made in the question of pay on\r\n          account of sex when the persons are equally qualified.\" What\r\n          is more natural than that the men who thought that women\r\n          were competent to instruct the future voters and legislators\r\n          of our land, should take the one step in advance of the\r\n          public sentiment of yesterday and give to her equal wages\r\n          for equal work? And when this step had been taken, what more\r\n          natural than that they should again move forward--this time\r\n          perhaps a little in advance of the public sentiment of\r\n          to-day--and give to those whom they consider competent to\r\n          instruct voters, the right to vote.\r\n\r\n          To the statement, so often made, that the law which this\r\n          bill is intended to repeal was passed thoughtlessly and\r\n          without proper consideration, I oppose the fact to which I\r\n          have adverted, that the law perfectly conforms to all the\r\n          other laws in relation to women upon our statute-book.\r\n          Studied in connection with the other laws it would seem to\r\n          have grown naturally from them. It harmonizes entirely with\r\n          them, and forms a fitting apex to the grand pyramid which is\r\n          being built up as broadly and as surely throughout all the\r\n          States of the Union as it has been built up and capped in\r\n          Wyoming.\r\n\r\n          The world does not stand still. The dawn of Christianity was\r\n          the dawn of light for woman. For eighteen centuries she has\r\n          been gradually but slowly rising from the condition of\r\n          drudge and servant for man, to become his helpmeet,\r\n          counselor and companion. As she has been advanced in the\r\n          social scale, our laws have kept pace with that advancement\r\n          and conferred upon her rights and privileges with\r\n          accompanying duties and responsibilities. She has not abused\r\n          those privileges, and has been found equal to the duties and\r\n          responsibilities. And the day is not far distant when the\r\n          refining and elevating influence of women will be as clearly\r\n          manifested in the political as it now is in the social\r\n          world.\r\n\r\n          Urged by all these considerations of right, and justice, and\r\n          expediency, and the strong conviction of duty, I approved\r\n          that act of which this bill contemplates the repeal, and it\r\n          became a law. To warrant my reconsidering that action, there\r\n          ought to be in the experience of the last two years\r\n          something to show that the reasons upon which it was founded\r\n          were unsound, or that the law itself was wrong or at least\r\n          unwise and inexpedient. My view of the teachings of this\r\n          experience is the very reverse of this. Women have voted,\r\n          and have the officers chosen been less faithful and zealous\r\n          and the legislature less able and upright? They have sat as\r\n          jurors, and have the laws been less faithfully and justly\r\n          administered, and criminals less promptly and adequately\r\n          punished? Indeed the lessons of this two years' experience\r\n          fully confirm all that has been claimed by the most ardent\r\n          advocate of this innovation.\r\n\r\n          In this territory women have manifested for its highest\r\n          interests a devotion strong, ardent, and intelligent. They\r\n          have brought to public affairs a clearness of understanding\r\n          and a soundness of judgment, which, considering their\r\n          exclusion hitherto from practical participation in political\r\n          agitations and movements, are worthy of the greatest\r\n          admiration and above all praise. The conscience of women is\r\n          in all things more discriminating and sensitive than that of\r\n          men; their sense of justice, not compromising or\r\n          time-serving, but pure and exacting; their love of order,\r\n          not spasmodic or sentimental merely, but springing from the\r\n          heart; all these,--the better conscience, the exalted sense\r\n          of justice, and the abiding love of order, have been made by\r\n          the enfranchisement of women to contribute to the good\r\n          government and well-being of our territory. To the plain\r\n          teachings of these two years' experience I cannot close my\r\n          eyes. I cannot forget the benefits that have already\r\n          resulted to our territory from woman suffrage, nor can I\r\n          permit myself even to seem to do so by approving this bill.\r\n\r\n          There is another, and in my judgment, a serious objection to\r\n          this bill, which I submit for the consideration and action\r\n          of your honorable body. It involves a reference to that most\r\n          difficult of questions, the limitations of legislative\r\n          power. High and transcendent as that power undoubtedly and\r\n          wisely is, there are limits which not even it can pass. Two\r\n          years ago the legislature of this territory conferred upon\r\n          certain of its citizens valuable rights and franchises. Can\r\n          a future legislature, by the passage of a law not liable to\r\n          the objection, that it violates the obligation of contracts,\r\n          take away those rights? It is not claimed, so far as I have\r\n          been informed, that the persons upon whom these franchises\r\n          were conferred have forfeited or failed to take advantage of\r\n          them. But even if such were the case it would be rather a\r\n          matter for judicial determination than for legislative\r\n          action. What that determination would be is clearly\r\n          indicated in the opinion of Associate-justice Story in the\r\n          celebrated case of Trustees of Dartmouth College _vs._\r\n          Woodward: \"The right to be a freeman of a corporation is a\r\n          valuable temporal right. * * It is founded on the same basis\r\n          as the right of voting in public elections; it is as sacred\r\n          a right; and whatever might have been the prevalence of\r\n          former doubts, since the time of Lord Holt, such a right has\r\n          always been deemed a valuable franchise or privilege.\"\r\n\r\n          But even if we concede that these rights once acquired may\r\n          be taken away, the passage of this bill would be, in my\r\n          judgment, a most dangerous precedent. Once admit the right\r\n          of a representative body to disfranchise its own\r\n          constituents, and who can establish the limits to which that\r\n          right may not be carried? If this legislature takes from\r\n          women their franchises or privileges, what is to prevent a\r\n          future legislature from depriving certain men, or classes of\r\n          men, that, from any consideration they desire to\r\n          disfranchise, of the same rights? We should be careful how\r\n          we inaugurate precedents which may \"return to plague the\r\n          inventors,\" and be used as a pretext for taking away our\r\n          liberties.\r\n\r\n          It will be remembered that in my message to the legislature\r\n          at the commencement of the present session I said: \"There is\r\n          upon our statue book an act granting to the women of Wyoming\r\n          territory the right of suffrage and to hold office which has\r\n          now been in force two years. Under its liberal provisions\r\n          women have voted in the territory, served on juries, and\r\n          held office. It is simple justice to say that the women,\r\n          entering for the first time in the history of the country\r\n          upon these new and untried duties, have conducted themselves\r\n          with as much tact, sound judgment, and good sense as the\r\n          men. While it would be claiming more than the facts justify,\r\n          to say that this experiment, in a limited field, has\r\n          demonstrated beyond a doubt the perfect fitness of woman, at\r\n          all times and under all circumstances, for taking a part in\r\n          the government, it furnishes at least reasonable presumptive\r\n          evidence in her favor, and she has a right to claim that, so\r\n          long as none but good results are made manifest, the law\r\n          should remain unrepealed.\"\r\n\r\n          These were no hastily formed conclusions, but the result of\r\n          deliberation and conviction, and my judgment to-day approves\r\n          the language I then used. For the first time in the history\r\n          of our country we have a government to which the noble words\r\n          of our _Magna Charta_ of freedom may be applied,--not as a\r\n          mere figure of speech, but as expressing a simple grand\r\n          truth,--for it is a government which \"derives all its just\r\n          powers from the consent of the governed.\" We should pause\r\n          long and weigh carefully the probable results of our action\r\n          before consenting to change this government. A regard for\r\n          the genius of our institutions, for the fundamental\r\n          principles of American autonomy, and for the immutable\r\n          principles of right and justice, will not permit me to\r\n          sanction this change.\r\n\r\n          These reasons for declining to give my consent to the bill,\r\n          I submit with all deference for the consideration and\r\n          judgment of your honorable body.\r\n\r\n                                             J. A. CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n     The Republicans in the House made an ineffectual effort to\r\n     sustain the veto, but the party whip and the power of the saloons\r\n     were too strong for them, and the bill was passed over the veto\r\n     by a vote of 9 to 4. It met a different and better fate, however,\r\n     in the Council, where it was sustained by a vote of 4 to 5, a\r\n     strict party vote in each case. Mr. Corlett, a rising young\r\n     lawyer, at that time in the Council and since then a delegate in\r\n     congress, made an able defense of the suffrage act and resisted\r\n     its repeal, sustaining the veto with much skill and final\r\n     success. And there was much need, for the Democrats had made\r\n     overtures to one of the Republican members of the Council (they\r\n     lacked one vote) and had obtained a promise from him to vote\r\n     against the veto; but Mr. Corlett, finding out the fraud in\r\n     season, reclaimed the fallen Republican and saved the law. It is\r\n     due to Mr. Corlett to say that he has always been an able and\r\n     consistent supporter of woman's rights and universal suffrage. He\r\n     is now the leading lawyer of the territory.\r\n\r\n     Since that time the suffrage act has grown rapidly in popular\r\n     favor, and has never been made a party question. The leading men\r\n     of both parties, seeing its beneficial action, have given it an\r\n     unqualified approval; and most, if not all, of its former\r\n     enemies have become its friends and advocates. Most of the new\r\n     settlers in the territory, though coming here with impressions or\r\n     prejudices against it, soon learn to respect its operation, and\r\n     admire its beneficial results. There is nowhere in the territory\r\n     a voice raised against it, and it would be impossible to get up a\r\n     party for its repeal.\r\n\r\n     The women uniformly vote at all our elections, and are exerting\r\n     every year a more potent influence over the character of the\r\n     candidates selected by each party for office, by quietly\r\n     defeating those most objectionable in point of morals. It is true\r\n     they are not now summoned to serve on juries, nor are they\r\n     elected to office; and there are some obvious reasons for this.\r\n     In the first place, they never push themselves forward for such\r\n     positions, as the men invariably do; and in the second place, the\r\n     judges who have been sent to the territory, since the first ones,\r\n     have not insisted on respecting the women's rights as jurors, and\r\n     in some cases have objected to their being summoned as such. But\r\n     these matters will find a remedy by and by. It used to be an\r\n     important question in the nominating caucuses, \"Will this\r\n     candidate put up money enough to buy the saloons, and catch the\r\n     loafers and drinkers that they control?\" Now the question is,\r\n     \"Will the women vote for this man, if we nominate him?\" There\r\n     have been some very remarkable instances where men, knowing\r\n     themselves to be justly obnoxious to the women, have forced a\r\n     nomination in caucus, relying on their money and the drinking\r\n     shops and party strength to secure an election, who have been\r\n     taught most valuable lessons by signal defeat at the polls. It\r\n     would be invidious to call names or describe individual cases,\r\n     and could answer no necessary purpose. But I would ask particular\r\n     attention to the following articles, taken from recent\r\n     newspapers, as full and satisfactory evidence of the truth of\r\n     these statements, and of the wisdom of granting universal\r\n     suffrage and equal rights to the citizens of Wyoming territory.\r\n\r\n     The Laramie City _Daily Sentinel_ of December 16, 1878, J. H.\r\n     Hayford, editor, has the following leading editorial:\r\n\r\n          For about eight years now, the women of Wyoming territory\r\n          have enjoyed the same political rights and privileges as the\r\n          men, and all the novelties of this new departure, all the\r\n          shock it carried to the sensibilities of the old\r\n          conservatives, have long since passed away. For a long\r\n          time--even for years past--we have frequently received\r\n          letters asking for information as to its practical results\r\n          here, and still more frequently have received copies of\r\n          eastern papers with marked articles which purported to be\r\n          written by persons who resided here, or had visited the\r\n          territory and witnessed the awful results or the total\r\n          failure of the experiment. We have usually paid no attention\r\n          to these false and anonymous scribblers, who took this\r\n          method to display their shallow wit at the sacrifice of\r\n          truth and decency. But recently we have received more than\r\n          the usual number of such missives, and more letters, and\r\n          from a more respectable source than before, and we take this\r\n          occasion and method to answer them all at once, and once for\r\n          always, and do it through the columns of the _Sentinel_, one\r\n          of the oldest and most widely circulated papers in the\r\n          territory, because it will be readily conceded that we would\r\n          not publish here at home, false statements and\r\n          misrepresentations upon a matter with which all our readers\r\n          are familiar, and which, if false, could be easily refuted.\r\n\r\n          We assert here, then, that woman suffrage in Wyoming has\r\n          been in every particular a complete success.\r\n\r\n          That the women of Wyoming value as highly the political\r\n          franchise, and as generally exercise it, as do the men of\r\n          the territory.\r\n\r\n          That being more helpless, more dependent and more in need of\r\n          the protection of good laws and good government than are\r\n          men, they naturally use the power put into their hands to\r\n          secure these results.\r\n\r\n          That they are controlled more by principle and less by party\r\n          ties than men, and generally cast their votes for the best\r\n          candidates and the best measures.\r\n\r\n          That while women in this territory frequently vote contrary\r\n          to their husbands, we have never heard of a case where the\r\n          family ties or domestic relations were disturbed thereby,\r\n          and we believe that among the pioneers of the West there is\r\n          more honor and manhood than to abuse a wife because she does\r\n          not think with her husband about politics or religion.\r\n\r\n          We have never seen any of the evil results growing out of\r\n          woman suffrage which we have heard predicted for it by its\r\n          opponents. On the contrary, its results have been only good,\r\n          and that continually. Our elections have come to be\r\n          conducted as quietly, orderly and civilly as our religious\r\n          meetings, or any of our social gatherings, and the best men\r\n          are generally selected to make and enforce our laws. We have\r\n          long ago generally come to the conclusion that woman's\r\n          influence is as wholesome and as much needed in the\r\n          government of the State as in the government of the family.\r\n          We do not know of a respectable woman in the territory who\r\n          objects to or neglects to use her political power, and we do\r\n          not know of a decent man in the territory who wishes it\r\n          abolished, or who is not even glad to have woman's help in\r\n          our government.\r\n\r\n          Our laws were never respected or enforced, and crime was\r\n          never punished, or life or property protected until we had\r\n          woman's help in the jury box and at the polls, and we\r\n          unhesitatingly say here at home that we do not believe a man\r\n          can be found who wishes to see her deprived of voice and\r\n          power, unless it is the one \"who fears not God nor regards\r\n          man,\" who wants to pursue a life of vice or crime, and\r\n          consequently fears woman's influence and power in the\r\n          government. We assert further that the anonymous scribblers\r\n          who write slanders on our women and our territory to the\r\n          eastern press, are either fools, who know nothing about what\r\n          they write, or else belong to that class of whom the poet\r\n          says:\r\n\r\n               \"No rogue e'er felt the halter draw\r\n                With good opinion of the law.\"\r\n\r\n          We took some pains to track up and find out the author of\r\n          one of the articles against woman suffrage to which our\r\n          attention was called, and found him working on the streets\r\n          of Cheyenne, with a ball and chain to his leg. We think he\r\n          was probably an average specimen of these writers. And,\r\n          finally, we challenge residents in Wyoming who disagree with\r\n          the foregoing sentiments, and who endorse the vile slanders\r\n          to which we refer, to come out over their own signature and\r\n          in their own local papers and take issue with us, and our\r\n          columns shall be freely opened to them.\r\n\r\n     There are some obvious inferences to be drawn and some rather\r\n     remarkable lessons to be learned, from the foregoing narrative.\r\n     In the first place, the responsibilities of self government, with\r\n     the necessity of making their own laws, was delegated to a\r\n     people, strangers to each other, with very little experience or\r\n     knowledge in such matters, and composed of various nationalities,\r\n     with a very large percentage of the criminal classes. It is a\r\n     matter of surprise that they should have so soon settled\r\n     themselves into an orderly community, where all the rights of\r\n     person and property are well protected, and as carefully guarded\r\n     and fully respected as in any of our old eastern commonwealths.\r\n     It is a still greater surprise that a legislature selected by\r\n     such a constituency, under such circumstances as characterized\r\n     our first election, and composed of such men as were in fact\r\n     elected, should have been able to enact a body of laws\r\n     containing so much that was good and practicable, and so little\r\n     that was injudicious, unwise or vicious.\r\n\r\n     In the next place, it is evident that there was no public\r\n     sentiment demanding the passage of the woman suffrage law, and\r\n     but few advocates of it at that time in the territory; that its\r\n     adoption, under such circumstances, was not calculated to give it\r\n     a fair chance to exert a favorable influence in the community, or\r\n     even maintain itself among the permanent customs and laws of the\r\n     territory. The prospect was, that it would either remain a dead\r\n     letter, or be swept away under the ridicule and abuse of the\r\n     press, and the open attacks of its enemies. But it has withstood\r\n     all these adverse forces, and from small beginnings has grown to\r\n     be a permanent power in our politics, a vital institution,\r\n     satisfactory to all our people. The far-reaching benefits it will\r\n     yet accomplish can be easily foreseen. To make either individuals\r\n     or classes respected and induce them to respect themselves, you\r\n     must give them power and influence, a fair field and full\r\n     enjoyment of the results of their labors. We have made a very\r\n     creditable beginning in this direction, so far as woman is\r\n     concerned, and we have no doubts about the outcome of it. Wyoming\r\n     treats all her citizens alike, and offers full protection, equal\r\n     rewards, and equal power, to both men and women.\r\n\r\n     Again it is very evident that while our women take no active part\r\n     in the primary nomination of candidates for office, they exercise\r\n     a most potent influence by the independent manner in which they\r\n     vote, and the signal defeat they inflict on many unworthy\r\n     candidates. Their successful opposition to the power of the\r\n     bar-rooms is a notable and praiseworthy instance of the wise use\r\n     of newly-acquired rights. The saloon-keepers used to sell\r\n     themselves to that party, or that man, who would pay the most,\r\n     and while robbing the candidates, degraded the elections and\r\n     debauched the electors. So long as it was understood that in\r\n     order to secure an election it was necessary to secure the\r\n     rum-shops, good men were left out of the field, and unscrupulous\r\n     ones were sought after as candidates. The women have already\r\n     greatly modified this state of affairs and are likely to change\r\n     it entirely in the end.\r\n\r\n     Another wonderful consequence which has attended the presence of\r\n     women at the polls, is the uniform quiet and good order on\r\n     election day. All the police that could be mustered, could not\r\n     insure half the decorum that their simple presence has everywhere\r\n     secured. No man, not even a drunken one, is willing to act like a\r\n     rowdy when he knows the women will see him. Nor is he at all\r\n     anxious to expose himself in their presence when he knows he has\r\n     drank too much. Such men quit the polls, and slink out of the\r\n     streets, to hide themselves from the eyes of the women in the\r\n     obscurity of the drinking shops.\r\n\r\n     Another fact of great importance is the uniform testimony as to\r\n     woman's success as a juror. It is true that there has been but a\r\n     limited opportunity, thus far, to establish this as a fact beyond\r\n     all doubt. But a good beginning has been made, a favorable\r\n     impression produced, and no bad results have accompanied or\r\n     followed the experiment. If our jury system of trying cases is to\r\n     be preserved, as a tolerable method of settling disputes and\r\n     administering justice in our courts, every one will admit that a\r\n     great improvement in the character of the jurors must be speedily\r\n     found. At present, a jury trial is generally regarded as a farce,\r\n     or something worse. The proof of this is seen in the fact that in\r\n     most of our courts the judges are required to try all cases\r\n     without a jury, where the parties to the action consent, and that\r\n     in a great portion of the cases the parties do consent.\r\n\r\n     Another notable observation is the rapid growth of opinion in\r\n     favor of woman suffrage among our people, after its first\r\n     adoption; but more particularly the change effected in the minds\r\n     of the new settlers, who come to the territory with old\r\n     prejudices and fixed notions against it. Neither early education,\r\n     nor personal bias, nor party rancor, has been able to withstand\r\n     the overwhelming evidence of its good effects, and of its\r\n     elevating and purifying influence in our political and social\r\n     organization.\r\n\r\n     I must add, in conclusion, that the seventh legislature of our\r\n     territory has just closed its session of sixty days. It was\r\n     composed of more members than the earlier legislatures were,\r\n     there being thirteen in the Council and twenty-six in the House.\r\n     Many important questions came up for consideration, and a wide\r\n     field of discussion was traveled over, but not one word was at\r\n     any time spoken by any member against woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nHon. M. C. Brown, district-attorney for the territory, confirms the\r\ntestimony given by the judges and Governor Campbell, in a letter to\r\nthe National Suffrage Convention held in Washington in 1884, which\r\nwill be found in the pamphlet report of that year.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[491] Messrs. Wade, Anthony, Gratz Brown, Buckalew, Cowan, Foster,\r\nNesmith, Patterson, Riddle. See Vol. II., Chapter XVII.\r\n\r\n[492] Ex-Governor Hoyt in his public speeches frequently gives this\r\nbird's-eye view of Bright's domestic and political discussions:\r\n\"Betty, it's a shame that I should be a member of the legislature\r\nand make laws for such a woman as you. You are a great deal better\r\nthan I am; you know a great deal more, and you would make a better\r\nmember of the Assembly than I, and you know it. I have been\r\nthinking about it and have made up my mind that I will go to work\r\nand do everything in my power to give you the ballot. Then you may\r\nwork out the rest in your own way.\" So he went over and talked with\r\nother members of the legislature. They smiled. But he got one of\r\nthe lawyers to help him draw up a short bill, which he introduced.\r\nIt was considered and discussed. People smiled generally. There was\r\nnot much expectation that anything of that sort would be done; but\r\nthis was a shrewd fellow, who managed the party card in such a way\r\nas to get, as he believed, enough votes to carry the measure before\r\nit was brought to the test. I will show you a little behind the\r\ncurtain, so far as I can draw it. Thus he said to the Democrats:\r\n\"We have a Republican governor and a Democratic Assembly. Now,\r\nthen, if we can carry this bill through the Assembly and the\r\ngovernor vetoes it, we shall have made a point, you know; we shall\r\nhave shown our liberality and lost nothing. But keep still; don't\r\nsay anything about it.\" They promised. He then went to the\r\nRepublicans and told them that the Democrats were going to support\r\nhis measure, and that if _they_ did not want to lose capital they\r\nhad better vote for it too. He didn't think there would be enough\r\nof them to carry it, but the vote would be on record and thus\r\ndefeat the game of the other party. And they likewise agreed to\r\nvote for it. So when the bill came to a vote it went right through!\r\nThe members looked at, each other in astonishment, for they hadn't\r\nintended to do it, _quite_. Then they laughed and said it was a\r\ngood joke, but they had \"got the governor in a fix.\" So the bill\r\nwent, in the course of time, to John A. Campbell, who was then\r\ngovernor--the first governor of the territory of Wyoming--and he\r\npromptly signed it! His heart was right. He saw that it was\r\nlong-deferred justice, and so signed it as gladly as Abraham\r\nLincoln wrote _his_ name to the Proclamation of Emancipation of the\r\nslaves. Of course the women were astounded! If a whole troop of\r\nangels had come down with flaming swords for their vindication,\r\nthey would not have been much more astonished than they were when\r\nthat bill became a law and the women of Wyoming were thus clothed\r\nwith the habiliments of citizenship.\r\n\r\n[493] No sooner had these gentlemen left than Mrs. Post and Mrs.\r\nArnold had a long interview with the governor, urging him to sign\r\nthe bill on the highest moral grounds; not only to protect the\r\npersonal rights of the women of the territory but to compel the men\r\nto observe the decencies of life and to elevate the social and\r\npolitical status of the people.--[E. C. S.\r\n\r\n[494] In the summer of 1871 Mrs. Stanton and myself, _en route_ for\r\nCalifornia, visited Wyoming and met the women who were most active\r\nin the exercise of their rights of citizenship. At Cheyenne we were\r\nthe guests of Mrs. M. B. Arnold and Mrs. Amalia B. Post. Mrs.\r\nArnold had a large cattle-ranch and Mrs. Post an equally large\r\nsheep-ranch a few miles out of the city, which they superintended,\r\nand from which each received an independent income. They had not\r\nonly served as jurors, but acted as foremen. At Laramie we were the\r\nguests of Mr. J. H. Hayford, editor of the _Laramie Sentinel_, and\r\nmet Grandma Swain, who was the first woman to cast her ballot in\r\nthat city. We also met Judges Howe and Kingman and Governor\r\nCampbell, and heard from them of the wonderful changes wrought in\r\nthe court-room and at the polls by the presence of enfranchised\r\nwomen. We spoke in the very court-room in which women had sat as\r\njurors and felt an added inspiration from that fact.--[S. B. A.\r\n\r\n[495] The following is the list of the first grand jury at Laramie\r\nCity, composed of nine men and six women, as impanneled and sworn:\r\nC. H. Bussard, foreman; Mrs. Jane E. Hilton, T.

She seems to be calmly contemplating\r\nthe magnificent harbor within the Golden Gate. The shadows on the\r\ndistant mountains, the richly-laden vessels and the floating clouds\r\nindicate the peaceful sunset hour, and the goddess, in harmony with\r\nthe scene is seated at her ease, as if after many weary wanderings\r\nin search of an earthly Paradise she had found at last the land of\r\nperennial summers, fruits and flowers--a land of wonders, with its\r\nmammoth trees, majestic mountain-ranges and that miracle of\r\ngrandeur and beauty, the Yosemite Valley. Verily it seems as if\r\nbounteous Nature in finishing the Pacific Slope did her best to\r\ninspire the citizens of that young civilization with love and\r\nreverence for the beautiful and grand.\r\n\r\nCalifornia, admitted to the Union in 1850, owing to the erratic\r\ncharacter of her early population, has passed through more\r\nvicissitudes than any other State, but she secured at last social\r\norder, justice in her courts and a somewhat liberal constitution,\r\nas far as the personal and property rights of the \"white male\r\ncitizen\" were concerned. By its provisions--\r\n\r\n     All legal distinctions between individuals on religious grounds\r\n     are prohibited; the utmost freedom of assembling, of speech and\r\n     of the press is allowed, subject only to restraint for abuse;\r\n     there is no imprisonment for debt, except where fraud can be\r\n     proved; slavery and involuntary servitude, except for crime, are\r\n     prohibited; wives are secured in their separate rights of\r\n     property; the exemption of a part of the homestead and other\r\n     property of heads of families from forced sale is recognized.\r\n\r\nSo far so good; but while the constitution limits the franchise to\r\nevery \"white male citizen\" over twenty-one, who has been a resident\r\nof the State six months, and thus makes outlaws and pariahs of all\r\nthe noble women who endured the hardships of the journey by land or\r\nby sea to that country in the early days, who helped to make it all\r\nthat it is, that instrument cannot be said to secure justice,\r\nequality and liberty to all its citizens. The position in the\r\nconstitution and laws of that vast territory, of the real woman who\r\nshares the every-day trials and hardships of her sires and sons\r\ninspires no corresponding admiration and respect, with the ideal\r\none who gilds and glorifies the great seal of the State.\r\n\r\nFor the main facts of this chapter we are indebted to Elizabeth T.\r\nSchenck.[496] She says:\r\n\r\n     Out of the stirring scenes and tragical events characterizing the\r\n     early days of California one can well understand that there came\r\n     of necessity many brave and adventurous argonauts and many women\r\n     of superior mental force, from among whom in after years the\r\n     woman suffrage cause might receive most devoted adherents. For\r\n     nearly a score of years after the great incursion of gold-seekers\r\n     into this newly-acquired State no word was uttered by tongue or\r\n     pen demanding political equality for women--none at least which\r\n     reached the public ear. There were no preceding causes, as in the\r\n     older States, to stimulate the discussion of the question, and\r\n     even that mental amazon, Eliza W. Farnham who was one of the\r\n     distinguished pioneers of California, gathered her inspiration\r\n     from afar, and thought and wrote for the whole world of women\r\n     without once sounding the tocsin for woman's political\r\n     emancipation. Many of the women who braved the perils of the\r\n     treacherous deep, or still more terrible dangers of the weary\r\n     march over broad deserts, inhospitable mountains, and through the\r\n     fastnesses of hostile and merciless Indians, to reach California\r\n     in the early times, entertained broad views upon the intellectual\r\n     capacity and political rights of women, but their efforts were\r\n     confined to fields of literature. While this advanced guard of\r\n     progressive women was moulding into form a social system out of\r\n     the turbulent and disorganized masses thrown together by the\r\n     rapidly-increasing population from all parts of the globe, the\r\n     elements were aggregating which in after years produced powerful,\r\n     outspoken thought and earnest action in behalf of disfranchised\r\n     women.\r\n\r\n     Here as elsewhere women took the lead in school matters and were\r\n     the most capable and efficient educators from the days of \"'49.\"\r\n     One of our permanent State institutions, Mills' Seminary, was\r\n     founded by a woman whose name it bears, and who, assisted by her\r\n     husband, Rev. Mr. Mills, conducted the school for nearly a\r\n     quarter of a century, until by an act of the legislature, she\r\n     conveyed it to the State. Several principals of the public\r\n     schools in San Francisco have held their positions for over\r\n     twenty consecutive years. Mrs. Jeanne Carr, deputy state\r\n     superintendent of public instruction from 1871 to 1875, was\r\n     succeeded by Mrs. Kate M. Campbell, who served most efficiently\r\n     for the full term. During Mrs. Carr's public service she visited\r\n     nearly every county in the State, attending teachers' institutes,\r\n     and lecturing upon educational topics with great ability. For\r\n     many years women have been eligible to school offices in\r\n     California and there is not a county in the State where women\r\n     have not filled positions as trustees or been elected to the\r\n     office of county superintendent.[497] Mrs. Coleman has been\r\n     reelected to that office in Shasta county, and Mrs. E. W.\r\n     Sullivan in Mono county has served for several terms.\r\n\r\n     The first attempt to awaken the public mind to the question of\r\n     suffrage for woman was a lecture given by Laura De Force Gordon\r\n     in Platt's Hall, San Francisco, February 19, 1868. Although the\r\n     attendance was small, a few earnest women were there[498] who\r\n     formed the nucleus of what followed. Soon after Mrs. Gordon\r\n     addressed the legislature in the senate-chamber at Sacramento,\r\n     and made an eloquent appeal for the political rights of women.\r\n     Among the audience were many members of the legislature who\r\n     became very deeply impressed with the justice of her demand,\r\n     including the subsequent governor of the State, George C.\r\n     Perkins, then senator from Butte county. Soon afterwards Mrs.\r\n     Gordon removed to Nevada, and no more lectures on woman suffrage\r\n     were given until the visit of Anna Dickinson in the summer of\r\n     1869.\r\n\r\n     The way was being prepared however, for further agitation by the\r\n     appearance of _The Revolution_ in 1868 in New York, which was\r\n     hailed by the women of California (as elsewhere) as the harbinger\r\n     of a brighter and better era. Its well filled pages were eagerly\r\n     read and passed from hand to hand, and the effect of its\r\n     startling assertions was soon apparent. Mrs. Pitts Stevens had\r\n     about that time secured a proprietary interest in the _San\r\n     Francisco Mercury_, and was gradually educating her readers up to\r\n     a degree of liberality to endorse suffrage. Early in 1869 she\r\n     became sole proprietor, changing the name to _Pioneer_, and threw\r\n     the woman suffrage banner to the breeze in an editorial of marked\r\n     ability.\r\n\r\n     The organization of the National Woman Suffrage Association in\r\n     New York, May, 1869, gave fresh impetus to the movement, and the\r\n     appointment of Mrs. Elizabeth T. Schenck as vice-president for\r\n     California by that association, met with the approval of all\r\n     those interested in the movement. Soon after this Mrs. Schenck\r\n     with her gifted ally, Mrs. Stevens, decided to organize a\r\n     suffrage society, and at an impromptu meeting of some of the\r\n     friends at the residence of Mrs. Nellie Hutchinson, July 27,\r\n     1869, the first association for this purpose on the Pacific coast\r\n     was formed. There were just a sufficient number of members[499]\r\n     to fill the offices. This society grew rapidly and within a month\r\n     the parlors were found inadequate to the constantly increasing\r\n     numbers. Through the courtesy of the Mercantile Library\r\n     Association their commodious apartments were secured.\r\n\r\n     The advent of Anna Dickinson afforded the ladies an opportunity\r\n     to attest their admiration for her as a representative woman,\r\n     which they did, giving her a public breakfast, September 14.\r\n     Their honored guest appreciated the compliment; and in an earnest\r\n     and eloquent speech referred to it, saying that although she had\r\n     received many demonstrations of the kind, this was the first ever\r\n     given her exclusively by her own sex.[500]\r\n\r\n     Soon after Miss Dickinson's departure, Mrs. Schenck, much to the\r\n     regret of the society, resigned the chair, and Mrs. J. W. Stow\r\n     was appointed to fill the vacancy. The ladies having for some\r\n     time considered the organizing of a State Society of great\r\n     importance, it was decided to hold a grand mass convention for\r\n     that purpose. There was need of funds to carry forward the work,\r\n     and a course of three lectures was suggested as a means to raise\r\n     money. This carried, on motion of Mrs. Stow, and her offer to\r\n     deliver the first lecture of the course was accepted. All the\r\n     members of the society devoted their energies to secure the\r\n     success of the undertaking. Many of them engaged in selling\r\n     tickets for the two weeks intervening, and on November 2, Mrs.\r\n     Stow gave her lecture to a large and interested audience, taking\r\n     for her theme, \"Woman's Work.\" The Rev. Mr. Hamilton followed,\r\n     November 9, with \"The Parlor and the Harem,\" and the Rev. C. G.\r\n     Ames concluded the course, November 18, with \"What Does it Mean?\"\r\n     The lectures were well received, and though not particularly\r\n     directed to the right of suffrage for women, succeeded in\r\n     attracting attention to the society under whose auspices they\r\n     were given, and helped it financially. About this time Mrs.\r\n     Gordon returned from the East and took an active part in\r\n     canvassing the State, lecturing and forming county societies\r\n     preparatory to securing as large a representation as possible at\r\n     the coming convention. The following report of the proceedings is\r\n     taken from the San Francisco dailies:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Laura deForce Gordon]\r\n\r\n\r\n          The convention to form a State Woman Suffrage Society, held\r\n          its first meeting in Dashaway Hall, Wednesday afternoon,\r\n          January 26, 1870. The hall was well filled. Mrs. E. T.\r\n          Schenck, vice-president of the National Association, was\r\n          chosen president, _pro. tem._, and Miss Kate Atkinson,\r\n          Secretary. A committee on credentials was appointed by the\r\n          chair, consisting of one member from each organization.[501]\r\n          During the absence of the committee quite an animated\r\n          discussion arose as to the admission of delegates. Mrs.\r\n          Gordon said the greatest possible liberality should be\r\n          exercised in admitting persons to the right to speak and\r\n          vote; that all who signed the roll, paid the fee, and\r\n          expressed themselves in sympathy with the movement, should\r\n          be admitted. After some discussion, Mrs. Gordon's views\r\n          prevailed, and the names of those who chose to qualify\r\n          themselves were enrolled. About 120 delegates were thus\r\n          chosen from nine suffrage societies in different parts of\r\n          the State. Many counties were represented in which no\r\n          organizations had yet been formed. Some rather humorous\r\n          discussion was had as to whether the president should be\r\n          called Mrs. Chairman or Mrs. Chairwoman. The venerable Mr.\r\n          Spear arose and suggested the title be Mrs. President, which\r\n          was adopted. Mrs. Gordon said she had noticed that when\r\n          questions were put to the meeting not more than a dozen\r\n          timid voices could be heard saying \"aye,\" or \"no.\" The\r\n          ladies must not sit like mummies, but open their mouths and\r\n          vote audibly. This disinclination to do business in a\r\n          business-like way, is discreditable. (Cheers). Mrs. Gordon's\r\n          hint was taken, and unequivocal demonstration of voices was\r\n          made thereafter upon the taking of each vote. Long before\r\n          the time arrived for the evening session, the hall in every\r\n          part, platform, floor and gallery, was crowded, and large\r\n          numbers were unable to gain entrance.\r\n\r\n          The Committee on Permanent Organization presented the\r\n          following names for officers of the convention: President,\r\n          Mrs. Wallis of Mayfield; Vice-Presidents, J. A. Collins, C.\r\n          G. Ames, Mrs. Mary W. Coggins; Secretaries, Mrs. McKee, Mrs.\r\n          Rider, Mrs. Perry; Treasurer, Mrs. Collins. On motion, Mrs.\r\n          Haskell and Mrs. Ames escorted the president to the rostrum,\r\n          and introduced her to the convention. Mrs. Wallis is a lady\r\n          of imposing presence, and very earnest in the movement. Upon\r\n          being introduced she said:\r\n\r\n          LADIES AND GENTLEMEN--I thank you for this expression of\r\n          your high esteem and confidence in electing me to preside\r\n          over your deliberations. I regard this as a severe ordeal,\r\n          but, having already been tested in this respect, I do not\r\n          fear the trials to come. I shall persevere until the\r\n          emancipation of women is effected, and in order to fulfill\r\n          my duties successfully upon this occasion, I ask the hearty\r\n          cooeperation of all. [Applause].\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Stow gave the opening address, after which\r\n          delegates[502] from various localities made interesting\r\n          reports. An able series of resolutions was presented and\r\n          discussed at length by various members of the convention,\r\n          and letters of sympathy were read from friends throughout\r\n          the country.[503]\r\n\r\n     From the first session, some anxiety was felt regarding the\r\n     action of the State Society in affiliating with one of the two\r\n     rival associations in the East. The Rev. C. G. Ames of San\r\n     Francisco, whose wife had been in attendance upon the Cleveland\r\n     convention of the American Association, was appointed\r\n     vice-president for California, while Mrs. E. T. Schenck had been\r\n     appointed vice-president by the National Association. In addition\r\n     to the names of officers of county societies appended to the call\r\n     for this convention, both Mrs. Schenck and Mrs. Ames signed in\r\n     their official capacity, as vice-president of their respective\r\n     Associations. Under these circumstances it was not strange that a\r\n     spirit of rivalry should manifest itself, but it was unfortunate\r\n     that it was carried so far as to breed disturbance in this infant\r\n     organization. The leading women looked upon Mrs. E. Cady Stanton\r\n     and Miss Susan B. Anthony as among the first who organized the\r\n     suffrage movement in the United States, and therefore felt that\r\n     it was due to them that our California Society which owed its\r\n     existence mainly to the efforts of Mrs. Schenck whom they had\r\n     appointed vice-president for California, should show its loyalty,\r\n     devotion and gratitude to them, by becoming auxiliary to the\r\n     National Association. On the other hand, Rev. C. G. Ames, being\r\n     an enthusiastic admirer of some of the leading spirits in the\r\n     American Association, desired it to be auxiliary to that. This\r\n     conflict having been foreshadowed, a letter was written to Miss\r\n     Anthony in relation to it. Her reply was received by Mrs. Schenck\r\n     on the first day of the convention, breathing a noble spirit of\r\n     unselfishness, advising us not to allow any personal feelings\r\n     towards Mrs. Stanton or herself to influence us in the matter,\r\n     but rather to keep our association entirely independent, free to\r\n     cooeperate with all societies having for their object the\r\n     enfranchisement of woman. Accordingly, the following resolution\r\n     was almost unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the California Woman Suffrage Society\r\n          remain independent of all other associations for one year.\r\n\r\n     The result was satisfactory to Mrs. Schenck and her sympathizers,\r\n     but Mr. Ames seemed loth to relinquish his preference for the\r\n     American, and the course taken had the effect of lessening his\r\n     zeal and that of his followers, until they gradually dropped from\r\n     the ranks. But the convention, despite the unfortunate schism,\r\n     was a grand success. The sessions were crowded, and so great was\r\n     the interest awakened in the public mind that a final adjournment\r\n     was not had until Saturday night, after four days of earnest,\r\n     profitable work. The press of the city gave full and fair reports\r\n     of the proceedings, though very far from endorsing woman's claim\r\n     to suffrage, and men and women of all classes and professions\r\n     took an active part in the deliberations. But of the multitude\r\n     who met in that first woman suffrage convention on the Pacific\r\n     coast but few were prominent in after years.\r\n\r\n     The newly organized society immediately arranged to send a\r\n     delegation to Sacramento, to present to the legislature then in\r\n     session a petition for woman suffrage. The delegation consisted\r\n     of Laura DeForce Gordon, Caroline H. Spear and Laura Cuppy Smith,\r\n     who were accorded a hearing before a special committee of the\r\n     Senate, of which the venerable Judge Tweed, an able advocate of\r\n     woman suffrage, was chairman. The proceeding was without a\r\n     parallel in the history of the State. The novelty of women\r\n     addressing the legislature attracted universal attention, and the\r\n     newspapers were filled with reports of that important meeting.\r\n\r\n     During the year 1870 a general agitation was kept up. A number of\r\n     speakers[504] held meetings in various parts of the State. The\r\n     newspapers were constrained to notice this all-absorbing topic,\r\n     though most of them were opposed to the innovation, and\r\n     maintained a bitter war against its advocates. Prominent among\r\n     them was the sensational San Francisco _Chronicle_ followed by\r\n     the _Bulletin_, the _Call_, and in its usual negative style, the\r\n     _Alta_, while the _Examiner_ mildly ridiculed the subject, and a\r\n     score of lesser journalistic lights throughout the State\r\n     exhibited open hostility to woman suffrage, or simply mentioned\r\n     the fact of its agitation as a matter of news. But the brave\r\n     pioneers in this unpopular movement received kindly sympathy and\r\n     encouragement from some journals of influence, first among which\r\n     was the San Francisco _Post_, then under the management of that\r\n     popular journalist, Harry George, afterwards distinguished as the\r\n     author of \"Progress and Poverty.\" The San Jose _Mercury_ was our\r\n     friend from the first, and its fearless and able editor, J. J.\r\n     Owen, accepted the office of president of the State woman\r\n     suffrage society to which he was elected in 1878. The Sacramento\r\n     _Bee_ also did valiant service in defending and advocating\r\n     woman's political equality, its veteran editor, James McClatchy,\r\n     being a man of liberal views and great breadth of thought, whose\r\n     powerful pen was wielded in advocacy of justice to all until his\r\n     death, which occurred in October, 1883. There were several county\r\n     journals that spoke kind words in our behalf, and occasionally\r\n     one under the editorial management of a woman would fearlessly\r\n     advocate political equality.\r\n\r\n     During the year of 1870, Mrs. Gordon traveled extensively over\r\n     the State, delivering more than one hundred lectures, beside\r\n     making an extended tour, in company with Mrs. Pitts Stevens,\r\n     through Nevada, where on the Fourth of July, at a convention held\r\n     at Battle Mountain, the first suffrage organization for that\r\n     State was effected. In February, 1871, Mrs. Gordon again lectured\r\n     in Nevada, remaining several weeks in Carson while the\r\n     legislature was in session. She was invited by that body to\r\n     address them upon the proposed amendment to the State\r\n     constitution to allow women to vote, which amendment was lost by\r\n     a majority of only two votes, obtained by a political trick, the\r\n     question being voted upon without a call of the House, when\r\n     several members friendly to the measure were absent. The author\r\n     of the proposed amendment was the Hon. C. J. Hillier, a prominent\r\n     lawyer of Virginia City, who, in bringing the bill before the\r\n     legislature in 1869, delivered one of the ablest arguments ever\r\n     given in favor of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n     In 1871 Mrs. Gordon again made an extended tour through\r\n     California, Oregon, and Washington Territory, traveling mostly by\r\n     stage, enduring hardships, braving dangers and everywhere\r\n     overcoming prejudice and antagonism to strong-minded women, by\r\n     the persuasiveness of her arguments. In September, while\r\n     lecturing in Seaettle, a telegram informed her of her nomination\r\n     by the Independent party of San Joaquin county for the office of\r\n     State senator, requesting her immediate return to California.\r\n     This necessitated a journey of nearly a thousand miles, one-half\r\n     by stage-coach. Six days of continuous travel brought her to\r\n     Stockton, where she entered at once upon the senatorial campaign.\r\n     Mrs. Gordon spoke every night until election, and succeeded in\r\n     awakening a lively interest in her own candidacy and in the\r\n     subject of woman suffrage. Her eligibility to the office was\r\n     vehemently denied, particularly by Republicans, who were badly\r\n     frightened at the appearance of this unlooked-for rival. The\r\n     pulpit, press, and stump speakers alternated in ridiculing the\r\n     idea of a woman being allowed to take a seat in the Senate, even\r\n     if elected. The Democratic party, being in the minority, offered\r\n     but little opposition, and watched with great amusement this\r\n     unequal contest between the great dominant party on the one side,\r\n     and the little Spartan band on the other. The contest was as\r\n     exciting as it was brief, and despite the great odds of money,\r\n     official power, political superiority, and the perfect machinery\r\n     of party organization in favor of her opponents, Mrs. Gordon\r\n     received about 200 votes, besides as many more which were\r\n     rejected owing to some technical irregularity. Among those who\r\n     took part in that novel campaign and deserving special mention,\r\n     was the venerable pioneer familiarly called Uncle Jarvis, who had\r\n     voted a straight Whig or Republican ticket for fifty years, and\r\n     who for the first time in his life scratched his ticket and voted\r\n     for Mrs. Gordon.\r\n\r\n     In July, 1871, California was favored by a visit from Mrs.\r\n     Stanton and Miss Anthony, who awakened new interest wherever\r\n     their logical and eloquent appeals were heard. Their advent was\r\n     hailed with joy, and they received marked attention from all\r\n     classes, the clergy not excepted. Every lecture given by them\r\n     drew out large assemblies of the most influential of the\r\n     citizens. Indeed, they received a continual ovation during their\r\n     stay in San Francisco. After Mrs. Stanton returned to New York,\r\n     Miss Anthony remained and traveled in California, Nevada, Oregon\r\n     and Washington Territory several months, speaking at conventions\r\n     held in San Francisco and Sacramento, besides lecturing in all\r\n     the principal towns, winning for herself great praise, and a\r\n     deeper respect for the cause she so ably represented. A\r\n     complimentary banquet was tendered her in San Francisco on the\r\n     eve of her departure eastward, at which eighty guests,\r\n     distinguished in art, literature and social life, sat down to a\r\n     sumptuous collation spread in the Grand Hotel.\r\n\r\n     In the early part of that year, 1871, Hon. A. A. Sargent and wife\r\n     returned to California from Washington, his term as\r\n     representative having expired, and both took an active part in\r\n     the work of woman's political enfranchisement. Mr. Sargent, with\r\n     commendable bravery, which under the circumstances was indeed a\r\n     test of courage, delivered an address in favor of woman suffrage\r\n     at a convention held in San Francisco, just on the eve of an\r\n     important political campaign, in which he was a candidate for\r\n     reelection to congress, and also to the United States Senate. Of\r\n     course, those opposed to woman suffrage tried to make capital out\r\n     of it against him, but without avail, for that able and\r\n     distinguished statesman was elected to both offices, his term as\r\n     representative expiring before he would be called upon to take\r\n     his seat in the United States Senate. His noble wife, Ellen Clark\r\n     Sargent, took an active interest in all the woman suffrage\r\n     meetings, and in November, 1871, was appointed, as was also Mrs.\r\n     Gordon, to represent California in the National convention to be\r\n     held in Washington in January, 1872.\r\n\r\n     During the session of the California legislature in 1871-2 a\r\n     delegation from the State Society visited Sacramento and was\r\n     accorded a hearing in the Assembly-chamber before the Judiciary\r\n     Committee of that body. Addresses were made by Mrs. Pitts\r\n     Stevens, Mrs. A. A. Haskell, Mrs. E. A. H. DeWolf and Hon. John\r\n     A. Collins.\r\n\r\n     During the session of 1873-4 a bill was passed by the legislature\r\n     making women eligible to school offices, and also one which\r\n     provided that all women employed in the public schools should\r\n     receive the same compensation as men holding the same grade\r\n     certificates.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Laura Morton has filled and ably discharged the office of\r\n     assistant State librarian for the past ten years. Mrs. Mandeville\r\n     was deputy-controller during the Democratic administration of\r\n     Governor Irwin, and proved herself fully capable of discharging\r\n     the duties of that responsible office; while for several years\r\n     women have been elected to various positions in the legislature\r\n     and employed as clerks.\r\n\r\n     July 10, 1873, the Woman Suffrage Society was incorporated under\r\n     the laws of the State, with Mrs. Sarah Wallis, president. Mrs.\r\n     Clara S. Foltz, a brilliant young woman who had begun the study\r\n     of law in San Jose, knew the statutes permitted no woman to be\r\n     admitted to the bar, and early in the session of 1877 drafted a\r\n     bill amending the code in favor of women, and sent it to Senator\r\n     Murphy of Santa Clara to be presented. Five years before this,\r\n     however, Mrs. Nettie Tator had applied for admission to the bar\r\n     at Santa Cruz. A committee of prominent attorneys appointed by\r\n     the court examined her qualifications as a lawyer. She passed\r\n     creditably and was unanimously recommended by the committee, when\r\n     it was discovered that the law would not admit women to that\r\n     learned profession.\r\n\r\n     Following the presentation of Mrs. Foltz' bill, Mrs. Knox\r\n     Goodrich, Laura Watkins, Mrs. Wallis and Laura De Force Gordon\r\n     were appointed by the State Society a committee to visit\r\n     Sacramento during the session and use their influence to secure\r\n     the passage of the \"Woman's Lawyer Bill,\" as it was termed, and\r\n     to petition for suffrage. Mrs. Gordon, who was also reading law,\r\n     was in Sacramento as editorial correspondent for her paper, the\r\n     _Daily Democrat_ of Oakland, and had ample opportunity to render\r\n     valuable service to the cause she had so much at heart. The bill\r\n     passed the Senate by a vote of 22 to 9, being ably advocated by\r\n     Senators N. Green Curtis, Judge Niles Searles of Nevada county,\r\n     Creed Haymond of Sacramento, and Joseph Craig of Yolo. In the\r\n     Assembly, after weeks of tedious delay and almost endless debate,\r\n     the bill was indefinitely postponed by a majority of one. By the\r\n     persistent efforts of Assemblymen Grove L. Johnson of Sacramento,\r\n     R. W. Murphy, Charles Gildea and Dr. May of San Francisco, the\r\n     bill was brought up on reconsideration and passed by two\r\n     majority. The session was within three days of its close, and so\r\n     bitter was the opposition to the bill that an effort was made to\r\n     prevent its engrossment in time to be presented for the\r\n     governor's signature. The women and their allies, who were on the\r\n     watch for tricks, defeated the scheme of their enemies and had\r\n     the bill duly presented to Governor Irwin, but not till the last\r\n     day of the session. Then the suspense became painful to those\r\n     most interested lest it might not receive his approval. Mrs.\r\n     Gordon, as editor of a Democratic journal, asserted her claims to\r\n     some recognition from that party and strongly urged that a\r\n     Democratic governor should sign the bill. Aided by a personal\r\n     appeal from Senator Niles Searles to his excellency, her efforts\r\n     were crowned with success; the governor's message sent to the\r\n     Senate, when the hands of the clock pointed to fifteen minutes of\r\n     twelve, midnight (at which hour the president's gavel would\r\n     descend with the words adjourning the Senate _sine die_),\r\n     announced that Senate bill number 66, which permitted the\r\n     admission of women to all the courts of the State, had received\r\n     his approval. There was great rejoicing over this victory among\r\n     the friends everywhere, though the battle was not yet ended.\r\n\r\n     The same legislature had passed a bill accepting the munificent\r\n     donation to the State of $100,000 from Judge Hastings to found\r\n     the Hastings College of Law, on condition that it be the law\r\n     department of the State University, and the college was duly\r\n     opened for the admission of students. At the beginning of the\r\n     December term Mrs. Foltz, who had been admitted to the District\r\n     Court in San Jose (being the first woman ever admitted to any\r\n     court in the State), came to San Francisco, and with Mrs. Gordon\r\n     applied for admission to the law college. The dean, Judge\r\n     Hastings, himself opposed to women being received as students,\r\n     told them it was a matter that must be laid before the board of\r\n     directors, but that they could attend the lectures _ad interim_.\r\n     Three days later they were informed that their application had\r\n     been denied. Satisfied that the law was in their favor, they\r\n     immediately appealed to the courts. To save time Mrs. Gordon\r\n     applied to the Supreme Court and Mrs. Foltz to the District\r\n     Court, simultaneously, for a writ of mandamus to compel the\r\n     directors to act in obedience to the law which, the petitioners\r\n     claimed, did not discriminate against women in founding the State\r\n     University or its departments. The Supreme Court, wishing perhaps\r\n     to shirk the responsibility of acting in the first instance, sent\r\n     their petitioner, Mrs. Gordon, to the lower court, which had in\r\n     the meantime ordered the writ to issue for Mrs. Foltz; so it was\r\n     decided to make hers the test-case, and by the courtesy of Judge\r\n     Morrison, now chief-justice of the Supreme Court, Mrs. Gordon was\r\n     joined with Mrs. Foltz in the prosecution of the cause. The board\r\n     of directors of the college consisted of the chief-justice of the\r\n     Supreme Bench and seven other lawyers, among the most\r\n     distinguished and able in the State. The case attracted great\r\n     attention and deep interest was taken in the proceedings. Judges\r\n     Lake and Cope, who were ex-justices of the Supreme Court,\r\n     assisted by T. B. Bishop, another learned practitioner at the\r\n     bar, were arrayed as counsel for the defense against these\r\n     comparatively young students in the law, who appeared unaided in\r\n     their own behalf. After one of the most interesting legal\r\n     contests in the history of the State these women came off\r\n     victors, and the good-natured public, through the press, offered\r\n     them congratulations. But the defendants would not yield without\r\n     a stubborn resistance and carried their cause on appeal to the\r\n     Supreme Court; hence many months elapsed before the final\r\n     struggle came, but victory again rewarded the petitioners, the\r\n     Supreme Court deciding that women _should_ be admitted to the law\r\n     department of the State University. Although excluded from the\r\n     benefit of the lectures in the college, Mesdames Gordon and Foltz\r\n     had improved their time in study, and in December, 1879, both\r\n     were admitted to the Supreme Court of the State, after a thorough\r\n     examination.\r\n\r\n     Prior to this legal contest, in the summer of 1878, when\r\n     delegates to the constitutional convention were to be elected,\r\n     Mrs. Gordon, urged by her friends in San Joaquin county, became\r\n     an independent candidate only a week or two before the election.\r\n     With Mrs. Foltz she made a very brief though brilliant canvass,\r\n     attracting larger and more enthusiastic audiences than any other\r\n     speaker. Mrs. Gordon received several hundred votes for the\r\n     office, and felt compensated for the time and money spent by the\r\n     great interest awakened in the subject of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n     As soon as the constitutional convention assembled in September,\r\n     Mrs. Gordon, although still pursuing her legal studies, was able\r\n     as a newspaper correspondent to closely watch the deliberations\r\n     of that body and urge the insertion of a woman suffrage clause in\r\n     the new organic law. The State Society delegated Mrs. Knox\r\n     Goodrich, Mrs. Sarah Wallis and Mrs. Watkins to join Mrs. Gordon\r\n     in pressing the claims of woman, but the opposition was too\r\n     strong and the suffrage clause remained declaring male citizens\r\n     entitled to vote, though a section in the bill of rights,\r\n     together with other provisions in the new constitution, renders\r\n     it quite probable that the legislature has the right to\r\n     enfranchise women without having to amend the organic law. At all\r\n     events the new instrument is far more favorable to women than the\r\n     old, as will now be shown. The agitation of the question of the\r\n     admission of women to the Law College, which began during the\r\n     session of the convention, led that body to incorporate the\r\n     following provision in the constitution:\r\n\r\n          ARTICLE II., SEC. 18. No person shall be debarred admission\r\n          to any of the collegiate departments of the State University\r\n          on account of sex.\r\n\r\n     Remembering the hard struggle by which the right to practice law\r\n     had been secured to women, and the danger of leaving it to the\r\n     caprice of future legislatures, Mrs. Gordon drafted a clause\r\n     which protects women in all lawful vocations, and by persistent\r\n     effort succeeded in getting it inserted in the new constitution,\r\n     as follows:\r\n\r\n          ARTICLE XX., SEC. 18. No person shall, on account of sex, be\r\n          disqualified from entering upon or pursuing any lawful\r\n          business, vocation or profession.\r\n\r\n     The adoption of this clause, so valuable to women, was mainly\r\n     accomplished by the skillful diplomacy of Hon. Charles S.\r\n     Ringgold, delegate from San Francisco, who introduced it in the\r\n     convention and worked faithfully for its adoption. Thus\r\n     California stands to-day one of the first States in the Union, as\r\n     regards the educational, industrial and property rights of women,\r\n     and the probability of equal political rights being secured to\r\n     them at an early day, is conceded by the most conservative.\r\n\r\n     About the time Mrs. Foltz and Mrs. Gordon were admitted to the\r\n     bar, they, as chief officers of the State W. S. S.\r\n     (incorporated), called a convention in San Francisco. It convened\r\n     in February, 1880, and was well attended. Mrs. Sargent took an\r\n     active part in the meetings, occupied the chair as president _pro\r\n     tem._, and subsequently spoke of the work done by the National\r\n     Association in Washington. Several prominent officials, unable to\r\n     be present, sent letters heartily endorsing our claims; among\r\n     these were Governor Perkins, State Senator Chace, and A. M.\r\n     Crane, judge of the Superior Court. Addresses were delivered by\r\n     Judge Swift, Marian Todd and Mrs. Thorndyke of Los Angeles, Judge\r\n     Palmer of Nevada city, and others. The newspapers of the city,\r\n     though still hostile to the object of the convention, gave very\r\n     fair reports. In September following, the annual meeting of the\r\n     society was held, and made particularly interesting by the fact\r\n     that the proposed new city charter, which contained a clause\r\n     proscriptive of women, was denounced, and a plan of action agreed\r\n     upon whereby its defeat should be secured, if possible, at the\r\n     coming election. The women worked assiduously against the\r\n     adoption of the city charter, and rejoiced to see it rejected by\r\n     a large majority.\r\n\r\n     The following facts in regard to the constitution and statute\r\n     laws of California were sent us by the Hon. A. A. Sargent:\r\n\r\n          In 1879, California adopted a new constitution, by means of\r\n          a constitutional convention. It was an unfortunate time for\r\n          such organic legislation, for the reason that the State was\r\n          rife at the time with the agitation of \"sand-lotters,\" as\r\n          they were called, a violent faction which assailed property\r\n          rights and demanded extreme concessions to labor. The\r\n          balance of power in the constitutional convention was held\r\n          by persons elected by this element, and resulted in a\r\n          constitution extraordinary in some of its features, but\r\n          which was adopted by the people after a fierce contest.\r\n\r\n          Women fared badly at the hands of these constitution-makers,\r\n          so far as suffrage is concerned. Section 1, article 2,\r\n          confirms the right of voting to \"every native male citizen,\"\r\n          and \"every male naturalized citizen,\" although a heroic\r\n          effort was made by the friends of woman suffrage to keep out\r\n          the word \"male.\" But section 18, article XX., provides that\r\n          \"no person shall, on account of sex, be disqualified from\r\n          entering upon or pursuing any lawful business, vocation or\r\n          profession.\"\r\n\r\n          Some years before, the State had adopted a \"civil code,\"\r\n          which was abreast of the world in liberality to women. This\r\n          code discarded the idea of any servility in the relation of\r\n          the wife to the husband. This code is still the law, and\r\n          provides, in effect, that husband and wife contract toward\r\n          each other obligations of mutual respect, fidelity and\r\n          support. The husband is the head of the family, and may\r\n          choose any reasonable place and mode of life, and the wife\r\n          must conform thereto. Neither has any interest in the\r\n          property of the other, and neither can be excluded from the\r\n          other's dwelling. Either may enter into any engagement or\r\n          transaction with the other, or with any other person,\r\n          respecting property, which either might if unmarried. They\r\n          may hold property as tenants in common or otherwise, with\r\n          each other, and with others. All property of the wife owned\r\n          by her before marriage, and acquired afterwards by gift,\r\n          devise, bequest or descent, with the rents, issues and\r\n          profit thereof, is her separate property, and she may convey\r\n          the same without his consent. All property acquired after\r\n          marriage is community property. The earnings of the wife are\r\n          not liable for the debts of the husband. Her earnings, and\r\n          those of minor children in her custody, are her separate\r\n          property. A married woman may dispose of her separate\r\n          property by will, without the consent of her husband, as if\r\n          she were single. One-half of the community property goes\r\n          absolutely to the wife, on the death of the husband, and\r\n          cannot be diverted by his testamentary disposition. A\r\n          married woman can carry on business in her own name, on\r\n          complying with certain formalities, and her stock, capital\r\n          and earnings are not liable to her husband's creditors, or\r\n          his intermeddling. The husband and father, as such, has no\r\n          rights superior to those of the wife and mother, in regard\r\n          to the care, custody, education and control of the children\r\n          of their marriage, while such husband and wife live separate\r\n          and apart from each other.\r\n\r\n          The foregoing exhibits the spirit of the California law. It\r\n          is believed by friends of woman suffrage that had the\r\n          convention been held under normal conditions, the word\r\n          \"male\" might have been eliminated from that instrument.\r\n\r\n     Several creditable attempts were early made in journalism. In\r\n     1855 Mrs. S. M. Clark published the weekly _Contra Costa_ in\r\n     Oakland. In 1858, _The Hesperian_, a semi-monthly magazine, was\r\n     issued in San Francisco, Mrs. Hermione Day and Mrs. A. M. Shultz,\r\n     editors. It was quite an able periodical,[505] and finally passed\r\n     into the hands of Elizabeth T. Schenck.\r\n\r\n     As journalists and printers, women have met with encouraging\r\n     success. The most prominent among them is Laura DeForce Gordon,\r\n     who began the publication of the _Daily Leader_ at Stockton in\r\n     1873, continued afterward at Oakland as the _Daily Democrat_,\r\n     until 1878. In Geo. P. Rowell's _Newspaper Reporter_ for 1874,\r\n     the _Stockton Leader_ is announced as \"the only daily newspaper\r\n     in the world edited and published by a woman.\" Mrs. Boyer, known\r\n     as \"Dora Darmoor,\" published different magazines and journals in\r\n     San Francisco during a period of several years, the most\r\n     successful being the _Golden Dawn_. Mrs. Theresa Corlett has been\r\n     connected with various leading journals of San Francisco, and is\r\n     well known as a brilliant and interesting writer. Miss Madge\r\n     Morris has not only made a place for herself in light literature,\r\n     but has been acting-clerk in the legislature for several\r\n     sessions. Mrs. Sarah M. Clark published a volume entitled\r\n     \"Teachings of the Ages\"; Mrs. Josephine Wolcott, a volume of\r\n     poems, called \"The World of Song.\"\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Amanda Slocum Reed, one of our most efficient advocates of\r\n     suffrage, has proved her executive ability, and capacity for\r\n     business, by the management of a large printing and publishing\r\n     establishment for several years. The liberal magazine called\r\n     _Common Sense_, was published by her and her husband--most of its\r\n     original contents the product of her pen; and when the\r\n     radicalism of her husband caused the suspension of that journal\r\n     in 1878, Mrs. Slocum began the publication of _Roll Call_, a\r\n     temperance magazine which was mainly edited by her gifted little\r\n     daughter Clara, only fifteen years old, who also set all the\r\n     type. Among the earliest printers of California was Lyle Lester.\r\n     She established a printing office in San Francisco in 1860, in\r\n     which she employed a large number of girls and women as\r\n     compositors. Miss Delia Murphy--now Mrs. Dearing--ranks with the\r\n     best printers in San Francisco, and several women in various\r\n     portions of the State have taken like standing. \"Mrs. Richmond &\r\n     Son,\" is the novel sign which decorates the front of a large\r\n     printing establishment on Montgomery street, San Francisco, known\r\n     for many years as the \"Woman's Cooeperative Printing Company,\" but\r\n     which, in fact, was always an individual enterprise. Mrs. Augusta\r\n     DeForce Cluff has entered upon her seventh year in practical\r\n     journalism as publisher of a sprightly weekly, the _Valley\r\n     Review_, at Lodi, in which enterprise she has met with remarkable\r\n     success, being a superior business manager as well as a facile\r\n     and talented writer. Some of her little poems have great merit.\r\n     Mrs. Cluff and Mrs. Gordon have both filled official positions in\r\n     the Pacific Coast Press Association. Miss Mary Bogardus, the\r\n     gifted young daughter of that pioneer journalist, H. B. Bogardus,\r\n     editor of _Figaro_, is her father's main assistant in all the\r\n     business of his office. Mrs. Wittingham has been elected\r\n     postmaster of the State Senate several terms, and is at present\r\n     employed in the U. S. branch mint in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n     One of the most meritorious and successful enterprises occupying\r\n     the attention of the women of California, is the silk culture,\r\n     which promises to develop into one of the dominant industries of\r\n     the nation. Mrs. G. H. Hittel first brought the subject into\r\n     public notice by able articles on the cultivation of the mulberry\r\n     tree, published in various journals. In 1880 she formed the\r\n     Ladies' Silk Culture Society of California. This association like\r\n     its predecessor, the first Woman Suffrage Society, was organized\r\n     and held its meetings in private parlors for a time, but it soon\r\n     required more room. Men have been taken into membership since the\r\n     object for which the society was formed seemed to be feasible,\r\n     and, as a natural result, whatever of financial and honorary\r\n     reward may be accorded the self-sacrificing women who performed\r\n     the arduous and thankless labor of founding the institution, will\r\n     be shared with the men who now come into the work.\r\n\r\n     During the session of the legislature of 1883, a committee was\r\n     appointed to ask an appropriation from the State for the purpose\r\n     of establishing a Filature or free silk-reeling school. After\r\n     considerable delay the committee called to their aid Mrs. Gordon,\r\n     and asked her to visit the State capital and see what could be\r\n     done. The session was rapidly drawing to a close, and even the\r\n     warmest friends of the measure feared that it was too late to\r\n     accomplish anything. But happily the bill was got through both\r\n     branches of the legislature and sent to the governor the last\r\n     hour of the session. By its provisions a State Board of Silk\r\n     Culture was created consisting of nine members, five of whom were\r\n     to be women, and the sum of $7,500 was appropriated. Thus women\r\n     have begun and are now fostering a great industrial enterprise\r\n     which in the near future will give to millions of hitherto\r\n     unemployed or ill-paid women and children an occupation\r\n     peculiarly suited to them, and which will add millions of dollars\r\n     annually to the revenue of the country. Mrs. Florence Kimball of\r\n     San Diego county was appointed a member of the State Board of\r\n     Silk Commissioners by Governor Stoneman in 1883.\r\n\r\n     Since the expiration of their term as superintendents of the\r\n     public schools of the State, Dr. and Mrs. James Carr have made\r\n     their home in that loveliest spot of southern\r\n     California--Passadena, where, overlooking rich orange groves and\r\n     luxurious vineyards, they enjoy the blessings of prosperity, and\r\n     where Mrs. Carr, with her ambitious, active nature, finds\r\n     congenial employment in demonstrating what woman can accomplish\r\n     in silk-culture, raisin-making, and the crystalizing of fruit.\r\n\r\n     Miss Austen, formerly a teacher in the public schools of San\r\n     Francisco, has a vineyard at Fresno, where she employs women and\r\n     girls to prepare all her considerable crop of raisins for market,\r\n     conceded to be of the best quality produced in the State. Mrs.\r\n     Ellen McConnell Wilson of Sacramento county, from the small\r\n     beginning, twenty years ago, of 320 acres of land, and less than\r\n     1,000 sheep, has now over 5,000 acres of rich farming land and\r\n     6,000 sheep. Mrs. H. P. Gregory of Sacramento, left a widow with\r\n     a large family of little children, succeeded her husband in the\r\n     shipping and commission business in which he was engaged on a\r\n     small scale. From such a beginning, Mrs. Gregory has built up one\r\n     of the largest trades in that city, and has by judicious\r\n     investments in real estate acquired property of a value exceeding\r\n     $100,000, besides having reared and educated her numerous family.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Elizabeth Hill was one of the early settlers in Calaveras\r\n     county, where her husband located land on the Mokelumne river\r\n     near Camanche in 1855. Six years after she was left a widow with\r\n     four little children. The support of the family devolved upon the\r\n     mother, and she engaged in cultivating the land, adding thereto\r\n     several hundred acres. In 1877 Mrs. Hill began the cultivation of\r\n     the Persian-insect-powder plant, known to commerce as Buhach. So\r\n     successful has this venture proved that she has now over 200\r\n     acres planted to that shrub, and manufactures each year about\r\n     fifteen tons of the Buhach powder, for which she finds a ready\r\n     sale. The number of women who have supported their families\r\n     (often including the husband), and acquired a competency in\r\n     boarding and lodging-house keeping, dressmaking, millinery,\r\n     type-setting, painting, fancy work, stock-dealing, and even in\r\n     manufacturing and mercantile pursuits, is legion.\r\n\r\n     In regard to the position of women in medicine, Miss Elizabeth\r\n     Sargent, M. D., writes:\r\n\r\n          Women are admitted on equal terms with men to the medical\r\n          and dental departments of the State University, and to the\r\n          Cooper Medical College of San Francisco. Women are also\r\n          eligible to membership in the State and various county\r\n          medical associations, as well as in the dental association.\r\n          There are in the State 73 women who have been recognized by\r\n          the authorities as qualified to practice. They may be\r\n          classified as follows: Practitioners of regular medicine,\r\n          30, 16 of whom are established in San Francisco; eclectics,\r\n          22, 9 in San Francisco; homoeopathists, 21, 2 in San\r\n          Francisco. Among these physicians two make a specialty of\r\n          the eye and ear, one in San Francisco and one in San Jose.\r\n          Two women have been graduated from the State Dental College,\r\n          located in San Francisco. In April, 1875, the Pacific\r\n          Dispensary Hospital for women and children was founded by\r\n          women. In 1881 a training-school for nurses was added. The\r\n          hospital department, although admitting women, is intended\r\n          especially for children, and is the only children's hospital\r\n          on the coast. The dispensary is for out-patients, both women\r\n          and children. The board of ten directors, the resident and\r\n          attending physicians of the hospital, and five out of the\r\n          seven connected with the dispensary are women. From a small\r\n          beginning the institution has increased to importance, and\r\n          bids fair to continue in its present prosperity and capacity\r\n          for good work. I have written thus lengthily that you may\r\n          see how energetic our women have been in originating and\r\n          carrying on such an institution.\r\n\r\n     The most prominent literary woman of the coast is undoubtedly\r\n     Miss M. W. Shinn. She is a graduate of our State University and\r\n     was the medal scholar of her class. At present she is the editor\r\n     of the _Overland Monthly_, and the excellent prospects of the\r\n     magazine are largely the result of her own courage and the hard\r\n     work she has done.\r\n\r\n     The higher education in the State is being put upon a secure\r\n     basis. Hon. Leland Stanford and his wife, Jane Lathrop Stanford,\r\n     have recently given a great part of their vast fortune for the\r\n     establishment of a university which bids fair to be the foremost\r\n     educational institution on the continent. In a letter specifying\r\n     his views in regard to the management of the university, Governor\r\n     Stanford says:\r\n\r\n          We deem it of the first importance that the education of\r\n          both sexes shall be equally full and complete, varied only\r\n          as nature dictates. The rights of one sex, political and\r\n          other, are the same as those of the other sex, and this\r\n          equality of rights ought to be fully recognized.\r\n\r\n     There are many men and women throughout the State who have\r\n     faithfully advocated political equality for all citizens.[506]\r\n\r\n     Mendocino county has the honor of claiming as a citizen, one of\r\n     the earliest and ablest women in this reform, Clarina Howard\r\n     Nichols, who may be said to have sown the seeds of liberty in\r\n     three States in which she has resided, Vermont, Kansas and\r\n     California. Since 1870, her home has been with a son in Pomo,\r\n     where she finished her heroic life January 11, 1885. Though\r\n     always in rather straitened circumstances, Mrs. Nichols was\r\n     uniformly calm and cheerful, living in an atmosphere above the\r\n     petty annoyances of every-day life with the great souls of our\r\n     day and generation, keeping time in the march of progress. She\r\n     was too much absorbed in the vital questions of the hour even to\r\n     take note of her personal discomforts. Many of her able articles\r\n     published in magazines and the journals of the day, and letters\r\n     from year to year to our conventions, were written in such\r\n     conditions of weakness and suffering, as only a hero could have\r\n     overcome. She was a good writer, an effective speaker, and a\r\n     preeminently brave woman, gifted with that rarest of all virtues,\r\n     common sense.\r\n\r\n     The advocacy of woman's rights began in Santa Cruz county, with\r\n     the advent of that grand champion of her sex, the immortal Eliza\r\n     Farnham, who braved public scorn and contumely because of her\r\n     advanced views, for many years before the suffrage movement\r\n     assumed organized form. Mrs. Farnham's work rendered it possible\r\n     for those advocating woman suffrage years later, to do so with\r\n     comparative immunity from public ridicule. A society was\r\n     organized there in 1869, and Rev. D. G. Ingraham, E. B. Heacock,\r\n     H. M. Blackburn, Mrs. Georgiana Bruce Kirby, Mrs. Van\r\n     Valkenburgh, W. W. Broughton and wife, and Mrs. Jewell were\r\n     active members.\r\n\r\n     Prominent in Santa Clara county is Mrs. Sarah Wallis of Mayfield.\r\n     From the first agitation of the subject in 1868, when she entered\r\n     heartily into the work of getting subscribers to _The\r\n     Revolution_, she has been untiring in her efforts to advance the\r\n     interests of women. A lady of fine presence, great energy and\r\n     perseverance, Mrs. Wallis has been able to accomplish great good\r\n     for her sex. With a large separate estate, when the statutes\r\n     prevented her as a married woman from managing it, she determined\r\n     that the laws should be changed, and never ceased her efforts\r\n     until she succeeded in getting an amendment to the civil code\r\n     which enables married women to make contracts. The most\r\n     successful suffrage meetings ever held in Santa Clara county have\r\n     been at Mayfield. There Mrs. Wallis and her husband, Judge Joseph\r\n     S. Wallace, make their spacious and luxurious home the rendezvous\r\n     of lecturers and writers in the great work of woman's\r\n     emancipation.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Sarah Knox Goodrich of San Jose, was among the first to see\r\n     the significance of the movement for woman's rights in 1868. Her\r\n     husband, William J. Knox, who shortly before his death had been\r\n     State senator, secured the passage of a bill, drafted by himself,\r\n     giving to married women the right to dispose of their own\r\n     separate property by will. Having been from her youth the\r\n     cherished companion of a man who believed in the equality of the\r\n     sexes, and being herself a thoughtful, clear-headed person, she\r\n     naturally took her place with those whose aim was the social and\r\n     political emancipation of woman, and has stood from the first a\r\n     tower of strength in this cause, giving largely of her wealth for\r\n     the propagation of its doctrines. Mrs. Knox Goodrich has for many\r\n     years paid her taxes, sometimes exorbitant, under protest, and at\r\n     important elections has also offered her vote, to have it\r\n     refused. The county suffrage society has had an untiring leader\r\n     in Mrs. Goodrich, and on all occasions she has nerved the weak\r\n     and encouraged the timid by her example of unflinching devotion.\r\n     The following extracts from a letter written by the lady will\r\n     show how effective her work has been:\r\n\r\n          In 1872, our society was invited to take part in the Fourth\r\n          of July celebration, which we did, and had the handsomest\r\n          carriages and more of them than any other society in the\r\n          procession. We paid our own expenses, although the city had\r\n          made an appropriation for the celebration. In 1876 we were\r\n          not invited to take part in the festivities, but some of us\r\n          felt that on such a day, our centennial anniversary, we\r\n          should not be ignored. Accordingly I started out to see what\r\n          could be done, but finding some of our most active friends\r\n          ill and others absent from home, I decided to do what I\r\n          could alone. I had mottoes from the grand declarations of\r\n          the Fathers painted and put on my house, which the\r\n          procession would pass on two sides.\r\n\r\n          Some of our most prominent ladies seeing that I was\r\n          determined to make a manifestation, drove with me in the\r\n          procession, our carriage and horses decorated with flags,\r\n          the ladies wearing sashes of red, white and blue, and\r\n          bearing banners with mottoes and evergreens. A little\r\n          daughter of Mrs. Clara Foltz, the lawyer, dressed in red,\r\n          white and blue, was seated in the center of the carriage,\r\n          carrying a white banner with silver fringe, a small flag at\r\n          the top with a silver star above that, with streamers of\r\n          red, white and blue floating from it, and in the center, in\r\n          letters large enough to be seen some distance, the one word\r\n          \"Hope.\" On my flag the motto was: \"We are Taxed without\r\n          being Represented\"; Mrs. Maria H. Weldon's, \"We are the\r\n          disfranchised Class\"; Mrs. Marion Hooker's, \"The Class\r\n          entitled to respectful Consideration\"; and Miss Hannah\r\n          Millard's, \"We are governed without our Consent.\" On the\r\n          front of my house in large letters was the motto: \"Taxation\r\n          without Representation is Tyranny as much in 1876, as it was\r\n          in 1776\"; on the other side was, \"We are Denied the Ballot,\r\n          but Compelled to Pay Taxes\"; fronting the other side was,\r\n          \"Governments Derive their Just Powers from the Consent of\r\n          the Governed.\" Mrs. McKee also had the last motto on her\r\n          house. On the evening of July 3, after we had all our\r\n          preparations completed, we sent to one of the marshals and\r\n          asked him to give us a place in the procession _next to the\r\n          negroes_, as we wished to let our legal protectors have a\r\n          practical illustration of the position occupied by their\r\n          mothers, wives, sisters and daughters in this boasted\r\n          republic. We _did_ want to go in, however, _ahead of the\r\n          Chinamen_, as we considered our position at present to be\r\n          between the two. The marshal willingly assigned us a place,\r\n          but not the one we desired. \"We cannot allow you,\" said he,\r\n          \"to occupy such a position. You must go in front, next to\r\n          the Pioneer Association\"; and being in part members of that\r\n          society we accepted the decision. Our carriage was the\r\n          center of attraction. Many, after reading our mottoes, said:\r\n          \"Well, ladies, we will help you to get your rights\"; \"It is\r\n          a shame for you to be taxed and not have the right to vote.\"\r\n          Hundreds of people stood and read the mottoes on the house,\r\n          making their comments, both grave and gay: \"Good for Mrs.\r\n          Knox\"; \"She is right\"; \"If I were in her place I would never\r\n          pay a tax\"; \"I guess one of the strong-minded lives here.\"\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Knox was married to Mr. Goodrich, the well-known architect,\r\n     in 1878, in whom she has found a grand, noble-souled companion,\r\n     fully in sympathy with all her progressive views, and with whom\r\n     she is passing the advancing years of her well-spent life in\r\n     luxury and unalloyed happiness.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Van Valkenburg tried to vote under the claim that the\r\n     fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States\r\n     entitled her to registration, and being refused, brought suit\r\n     against the registrars. The case was decided against her after\r\n     being carried to the Supreme Court of California. These cases\r\n     argued in the Supreme Court have been of inestimable value in the\r\n     progress of the movement, lifting the question of woman's rights\r\n     as a citizen above the mists of ridicule and prejudice, into the\r\n     region of reason and constitutional law. We cannot too highly\r\n     appreciate the bravery and persistence of the few women who have\r\n     furnished these test cases and compelled the highest courts to\r\n     record their decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[496] Having spent several days with Mrs. Schenck, in her cozy,\r\nartistic home surrounded with a hedge of brilliant geraniums, I can\r\nreadily testify to the many virtues and attractions her large\r\ncircle of friends has always accorded her. From all I had heard I\r\nwas prepared to find Mrs. Schenck a woman of remarkable cultivation\r\nand research, and I was not disappointed. Refined, honorable in her\r\nfeeling, clear in her judgments of men and measures, just and\r\nupright In all her words and actions, she was indeed the fitting\r\nleader for the uprising of women on the Pacific Slope. The\r\npreparation of this chapter occupied the last year of her life, her\r\none wish to live was to complete the task, but when her failing\r\npowers made that impossible she charged her friend Mrs. Manning,\r\nwith whom she resided, to take up the work that had fallen from her\r\nhands and make a fair record of all that had been done and said, by\r\nher noble coaedjutors, who had labored so faithfully to inaugurate\r\nthe greatest reform of the century.--[E. C. S.\r\n\r\n[497] Among them are Laura Fowler, Kate Kennedy, Mary N. Wadleigh,\r\nTrinity County; Anna L. Spencer, Alpine; Mrs. D. M. Coleman,\r\nShasta; Miss A. L.

Graham.\r\nOakland Board, Miss A. Aldrich; Sacramento, Charlotte Slater; San\r\nJose, Mrs. B. L. Hollenbeck. Sister Mary Frances of the order of\r\n\"Sisters of Charity\" came to California in 1849, and devoted her\r\ngreat energies, and rare accomplishments, to the cause of education\r\nup to the time of her demise in April, 1881. Annie Haven, Miss\r\nPrince, Miss Austin, and a host of others have been successful in\r\nthe same field of labor, including Miss Merweidel, founder of the\r\nkindergarten system in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n[498] Among them were Mrs. Sarah Wallis of Mayfield, Mrs. E.

What ideas were revolving in these young minds in that\r\nlong journey of 3,000 miles, six months in duration, it would be\r\ndifficult to imagine, but the love of liberty had been infused in\r\ntheir dreams somewhere, either in their eastern homes from the\r\ntragic scenes of the anti-slavery conflict, or on that perilous\r\nmarch amidst those eternal solitudes by day and the solemn\r\nstillness of the far-off stars in the gathering darkness. That this\r\nlong communion with great nature left its impress on their young\r\nhearts and sanctified their lives to the best interests of humanity\r\nat large, is clearly seen in the deeply interesting accounts they\r\ngive of their endeavors to mould the governments of their\r\nrespective territories on republican principles. Writing of herself\r\nand her labors, Mrs. Duniway says:\r\n\r\n     I was born in Pleasant Grove, Tazewell county, Illinois, October\r\n     22, 1834, of the traditional \"poor but respectable parentage\"\r\n     which has honored the advent of many a more illustrious worker\r\n     than myself. Brought up on a farm and familiar from my earliest\r\n     years with the avocations of rural life, spending the early\r\n     spring-times in the maple-sugar camp, the later weeks in\r\n     gardening and gathering stove-wood, the summers in picking and\r\n     spinning wool, and the autumns in drying apples, I found little\r\n     opportunity, and that only in winter, for books or play. My\r\n     father was a generous-hearted, impulsive, talented, but\r\n     uneducated man; my mother was a conscientious, self-sacrificing,\r\n     intelligent, but uneducated woman. Both were devotedly religious,\r\n     and both believed implicitly that self-abnegation was the crowing\r\n     glory of womanhood. Before I was seventeen I was employed as a\r\n     district school teacher, received a first-class certificate and\r\n     taught with success, though how I became possessed of the\r\n     necessary qualifications I to this day know not. I never did,\r\n     could, or would study when at school.\r\n\r\n     In the spring of 1852 my father decided to emigrate to Oregon. My\r\n     invalid mother expostulated in vain; she and nine of us children\r\n     were stowed away in ox-wagons, where for six months we made our\r\n     home, cooking food and washing dishes around camp-fires, sleeping\r\n     at night in the wagons, and crossing many streams upon\r\n     wagon-beds, rigged as ferryboats. When our weary line of march\r\n     had reached the Black Hills of Wyoming my mother became a victim\r\n     to the dreadful epidemic, cholera, that devastated the emigrant\r\n     trains in that never-to-be-forgotten year, and after a few hours'\r\n     illness her weary spirit was called to the skies. We made her a\r\n     grave in the solitudes of the eternal hills, and again took up\r\n     our line of march, \"too sad to talk, too dumb to pray.\" But ten\r\n     weeks after, our Willie, the baby, was buried in the sands of the\r\n     Burnt River mountains. Reaching Oregon in the fall with our\r\n     broken household, consisting of my father and eight motherless\r\n     children, I engaged in school-teaching till the following August,\r\n     when I allowed the name of \"Scott\" to become \"Duniway.\" Then for\r\n     twenty years I devoted myself, soul and body, to the cares,\r\n     toils, loves and hopes of a conscientious wife and mother. Five\r\n     sons and one daughter have been born to us, all of whom are\r\n     living and at home, engaged with their parents in harmonious\r\n     efforts for the enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\n     The first woman suffrage society ever formed in Oregon, was\r\n     organized in Salem, the capital of the State, in the autumn of\r\n     1870, and consisted of about a dozen members. Col. C. A. Reed was\r\n     chosen president and G. W. Lawson, secretary. This little society\r\n     which maintained a quiescent existence for a year or more and\r\n     then disbanded without ceremony, was, in part, the basis of all\r\n     subsequent work of its character in Oregon. In the winter of 1871\r\n     this society honored me with credentials to a seat in the woman\r\n     suffrage convention which was to meet in San Francisco the\r\n     following May. My business called me to the Golden City before\r\n     the time for the convention, and a telegraphic summons compelled\r\n     me to return to Oregon without meeting with the California\r\n     Association in an official way, as I had hoped. But my\r\n     credentials introduced me to the San Francisco leaders, among\r\n     whom Emily Pitts Stevens occupied a prominent position as editor\r\n     and publisher of the _The Pioneer_, the first woman suffrage\r\n     paper that appeared on the Pacific coast. Before returning to\r\n     Oregon I resolved to purchase an outfit and begin the publication\r\n     of a newspaper myself, as I felt that the time had come for\r\n     vigorous work in my own State, and we had no journal in which the\r\n     demands of women for added rights were treated with respectful\r\n     consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Yours for Liberty, Abigail Scott Duniway\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n     Soon after reaching my home in Albany I sold my millinery store\r\n     and removed to Portland, where, on May 5, 1871, the _New\r\n     Northwest_ made its appearance, and a siege of the citadels of a\r\n     one-sexed government began, which at this writing is going on\r\n     with unabated persistency. The first issue of this journal was\r\n     greeted by storms of ridicule. Everybody prophesied its early\r\n     death, and my personal friends regarded the enterprise with\r\n     sincere pity, believing it would speedily end in financial\r\n     disaster. But the paper, in spite of opposition and burlesque,\r\n     has grown and prospered.\r\n\r\n     In August, 1871, Susan B. Anthony favored Oregon and Washington\r\n     territory with a visit. The fame of this veteran leader had\r\n     preceded her, and she commanded a wide hearing. We traveled\r\n     together over the country, visiting inland villages as well as\r\n     larger towns, holding woman suffrage meetings and getting many\r\n     subscribers for the _New Northwest_. During these journeyings I\r\n     became quite thoroughly initiated into the movement and made my\r\n     first efforts at public speaking. After a six weeks' campaign in\r\n     Oregon, we went to Olympia, the capital of Washington territory,\r\n     where the legislature was in session, and where, through a motion\r\n     of Hon. Elwood Evans, we were invited to address the Assembly in\r\n     advocacy of equal rights for all the people. From Olympia we\r\n     proceeded to Victoria, a border city belonging to a woman's\r\n     government, where we found that the idea of the ballot for woman\r\n     was even more unpopular than in the United States, though all, by\r\n     strange inconsistency, were intensely loyal to their queen. After\r\n     an interesting and profitable experience in the British\r\n     possessions we returned to Puget Sound, stopping over on our\r\n     route at the different milling towns that teem with busy life\r\n     upon the evergreen shores of this Mediterranean of the Pacific.\r\n     At Seaettle we organized an association[507] in which many of the\r\n     leading ladies and gentlemen took a prominent part; after which\r\n     we returned to Olympia, where a territorial organization was\r\n     effected.[508]\r\n\r\n     Returning to Portland, we called a convention, and organized the\r\n     Oregon State Woman Suffrage Association, with Harriet W.\r\n     Williams, a venerated octogenarian, president. This estimable\r\n     woman had been one of the earliest leaders of the woman suffrage\r\n     movement in the State of New York, and her presence at the head\r\n     of our meetings in Oregon was a source of genuine satisfaction to\r\n     the friends of the cause in the new State of her adoption.\r\n     Subsequently, Mrs. Williams was compelled to resign on account of\r\n     increasing infirmities, but her wise counsels are still cherished\r\n     by her successors, whom she regards with motherly solicitude as\r\n     she serenely awaits the final summons of the unseen messenger.\r\n     Many of those who early distinguished themselves in this\r\n     connection deserve special mention because of their\r\n     long-continued zeal in the work.[509] If others failed us, these\r\n     were always ready to work the hardest when the fight was hottest.\r\n     And whatever might be our differences of opinion personally, we\r\n     have always presented an unbroken phalanx to the foe. The\r\n     original society at Salem having disbanded, its members joined\r\n     the new State Association organized at Portland, which has ever\r\n     since been regarded as the nucleus of all our activities.\r\n\r\n     In September of 1872, I visited the Oregon legislature, where I\r\n     went clothed by our association with discretionary power to do\r\n     what I could to secure special legislation for the women of the\r\n     State, who, with few exceptions, were at that time entirely under\r\n     the dominion of the old common law. The exceptions were those\r\n     fortunate women who, having come to Oregon as early as 1850 and\r\n     '52, had, by virtue of a United States law, known as the Oregon\r\n     Donation Land Act, become possessed of \"claims,\" as they were\r\n     called, on equal shares with their husbands, their half, or\r\n     halves, of the original ground being set apart as their separate\r\n     property in realty and _fee simple_. This Donation Land Act\r\n     deserves especial mention, it being the first law enacted in the\r\n     United States which recognized the individual personality of a\r\n     married woman. It became a temporary law of congress in 1850,\r\n     mainly through the efforts of Hon. Samuel R. Thurston, delegate\r\n     from Oregon territory (which at that time included the whole of\r\n     Washington territory), aided by the eminent Dr. Linn of Missouri,\r\n     from whom one of the principal counties of the State of Oregon\r\n     derives its name.\r\n\r\n     My first experience in the capitol was particularly trying. I\r\n     spent two days among my acquaintances in Salem in a vain attempt\r\n     to find a woman who was ready or willing to accompany me to the\r\n     state-house. All were anxious that I should go, but each was\r\n     afraid to offend her husband, or make herself conspicuous, by\r\n     going herself. Finally, when I had despaired of securing company,\r\n     and had nerved myself to go alone, Mary P. Sawtelle, who\r\n     afterwards became a physician, and now resides in San Francisco\r\n     where she has a lucrative practice, volunteered to stand by me,\r\n     and together we entered the dominion hitherto considered sacred\r\n     to the aristocracy of sex, and took seats in the lobby, our\r\n     hearts beating audibly. Hon. Joseph Engle, perceiving the\r\n     innovation and knowing me personally, at once arose, and, after a\r\n     complimentary speech in which he was pleased to recognize my\r\n     position as a journalist, moved that I be invited to a seat\r\n     within the bar and provided with table and stationery as were\r\n     other members of the profession. The motion carried, with only\r\n     two or three dissenting votes; and the way was open from that\r\n     time forward for women to compete with men on equal terms for all\r\n     minor positions in both branches of the legislature--a privilege\r\n     they have not been slow to avail themselves of, scores of them\r\n     thronging the capitol in these later years, and holding valuable\r\n     clerkships, many of them sneering the while at the efforts of\r\n     those who opened the way for them to be there at all.\r\n\r\n     Hon. Samuel Corwin introduced a woman suffrage bill in the House\r\n     of Representatives early in the session; and while it was\r\n     pending, I was invited to make an appeal in its behalf, of which\r\n     I remember very little, so frightened and astonished was I,\r\n     except that once I inadvertently alluded to a gentleman by his\r\n     name instead of his county, whereupon, being called to order, I\r\n     blushed and begged pardon, but put myself at ease by informing\r\n     the gentlemen that in all the bygone years while they had been\r\n     studying parliamentary rules, I had been rocking the cradle.\r\n\r\n     One member who had made a vehement speech against the bill, in\r\n     which he had declared that no respectable woman in his county\r\n     desired the elective franchise, became particularly incensed, as\r\n     was natural, upon my exhibiting a woman suffrage petition signed\r\n     by the women he had misrepresented, and headed, _mirabile dictu_,\r\n     by the name of his own wife! The so-called representative of\r\n     women lost his temper, and gave vent to some inelegant\r\n     expletives, for which he was promptly reprimanded by the chair.\r\n     This offender has since been many times a candidate for office,\r\n     but the ladies of his district have always secured his defeat.\r\n     The woman suffrage bill received an unexpectedly large vote at\r\n     this session, and was favored in 1874 by a still larger one, when\r\n     it was ably championed by Hon. C. A. Reed, the before named\r\n     ex-president of the first woman suffrage society in the State.\r\n\r\n     In 1872 the Senate, the House concurring, passed a Married\r\n     Woman's Sole Trader bill, under the able leadership of Hon. J. N.\r\n     Dolph, who has since distinguished himself as our champion in the\r\n     Senate of the United States. This bill has ever since enabled any\r\n     woman engaged in business on her own account to register the fact\r\n     in the office of the county clerk, and thereby secure her tools,\r\n     furniture, or stock in trade against the liability of seizure by\r\n     her husband's creditors.\r\n\r\n     Perhaps I cannot better illustrate the general feeling of\r\n     opposition to women having a place in public affairs at that\r\n     time, than by describing the scenes in the State Temperance\r\n     Alliance in February of that year, when somebody placed my name\r\n     in nomination as chairman of an important committee. The\r\n     presiding officer was seized with a sudden deafness when the\r\n     nomination was made, and the Alliance was convulsed with\r\n     merriment. Ladies on all sides buzzed about me, and urged me to\r\n     resent the insult in the name of womanhood. And, as none of them\r\n     were at that time public speakers, I felt obliged to rise and\r\n     speak for myself.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. President,\" I exclaimed, \"by what right do you refuse to\r\n     recognize women when their names are called? Are men the only\r\n     lawful members of this Alliance? And if so, is it not better for\r\n     the women delegates to go home?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. President: The committees are now full!\" shouted an excited\r\n     voter. Somebody, doubtless in ridicule, then nominated me as\r\n     vice-president-at-large, which was carried amid uproarious\r\n     merriment. I took my seat, half frightened and wholly indignant;\r\n     and the deliberations of the sovereign voters were undisturbed\r\n     for several hours thereafter by word or sign from women. At last\r\n     they got to discussing a bill for a prohibitory liquor law, and\r\n     the heat of debate ran high. During the excitement somebody\r\n     carried a note to the presiding officer, who read it, smiled,\r\n     colored, and rising, said: \"We are hearing nothing from the\r\n     ladies, and yet they constitute a large majority of this\r\n     Alliance. Mrs. Duniway, will you not favor us with a speech?\"\r\n\r\n     I was taken wholly by surprise, but sprang to my feet and said:\r\n     \"Mr. President: I have always wondered what it was that consumed\r\n     so much time in men's conventions. I hope gentlemen will pardon\r\n     the criticism, but you talk too much, and too many of you try to\r\n     talk at once. My head is aching from the roar and din of your\r\n     noisy orators. Gentlemen, what does it all amount to? You are\r\n     talking about prohibition, but you overestimate your political\r\n     strength. Disastrous failures attend upon all your endeavors to\r\n     conquer existing evils by the votes of men alone. Give women the\r\n     legal power to combat intemperance, and they will soon be able to\r\n     prove that they do not like drunken husbands any better than men\r\n     like drunken wives. Make women _free_. Give them the power the\r\n     ballot gives to you, and the control of their own earnings which\r\n     rightfully belong to them, and every woman will be able to settle\r\n     this prohibition business in her own home and on her own account.\r\n     Men will not tolerate drunkenness in their wives; and women will\r\n     not tolerate it in husbands unless compelled to.\"\r\n\r\n     A prominent clergyman arose, and said: \"Mr. President: I charge\r\n     the sins of the world upon the mothers of men. There are twenty\r\n     thousand fallen women in New York--two millions of them in\r\n     America. We cannot afford to let this element vote.\" Before I was\r\n     aware of what I was doing I was on my feet again. Shaking my\r\n     finger at the clergymen, I exclaimed: \"How _dare_ you make such\r\n     charges against the mothers of men? You tell us of two millions\r\n     of fallen women who, you say, would vote for drunkenness; but\r\n     what say you, sir, to the twenty millions of fallen men--all\r\n     voters--whose patronage alone enables fallen women to live? Would\r\n     you disfranchise them, sir? I pronounce your charge a libel upon\r\n     womanhood, and I know that if we were voters you would not _dare_\r\n     to utter it.\"\r\n\r\n     A gentleman from Michigan--Mr. Curtis--called me to order, saying\r\n     my remarks were personal. \"You, sir, sat still and didn't call\r\n     this man to order while he stood up and insulted all womanhood!\"\r\n     I exclaimed, vehemently. \"Prohibition is the question before the\r\n     house,\" said the gentleman, \"and the lady should confine herself\r\n     to the resolution.\" \"That is what I am doing, sir. I am talking\r\n     about prohibition, and the only way possible to make it succeed.\"\r\n\r\n     The chair sustained me amid cries of \"good!\" \"good!\" but I had\r\n     become too thoroughly self-conscious by this time to be able to\r\n     say anything further, and, with a bow to the chairman whom I had\r\n     before forgotten to address, I tremblingly took my seat.\r\n\r\n     A resolution was passed, after a long and stormy debate,\r\n     declaring it the duty of the legislature to empower women to vote\r\n     on all questions connected with the liquor traffic; and I, as its\r\n     author, was chosen a committee to present the same for\r\n     consideration at the coming legislative session. Woman suffrage\r\n     gained a new impetus all over the Northwest through this victory.\r\n     Everybody congratulated its advocates, and the good minister who\r\n     had unwittingly caused the commotion seized the first opportunity\r\n     to explain that he had always been an advocate of the cause. I\r\n     was by this time so thoroughly advertised by the abuse of the\r\n     press that I had no difficulty in securing large audiences in all\r\n     parts of the Pacific Northwest.\r\n\r\n     I was chosen in April, 1872, as delegate to the annual meeting of\r\n     the National Association, held in New York the following month.\r\n     Horace Greeley received the nomination for the presidency at the\r\n     Cincinnati Liberal Republican Convention while I was on the way;\r\n     and when I reached New York I at first threw what influence I had\r\n     in the Association in favor of the great editor. But Miss\r\n     Anthony, who knew Mr. Greeley better than I did, caused me to be\r\n     appointed chairman of a committee to interview the reputed\r\n     statesman and officially report the result at the evening\r\n     session. Miss Anthony and Mrs. Jane Graham Jones of Chicago were\r\n     the other members of this committee. We obtained the desired\r\n     interview, of which it only needs to be said that it became my\r\n     humiliating duty to ask pardon in the evening for the speech in\r\n     advocacy of the illustrious candidate which in my ignorance I had\r\n     made in the morning. That Mr. Greeley owed his defeat in part to\r\n     the opposition of women in that memorable campaign, I have never\r\n     doubted. But he builded better than he knew in earlier years, for\r\n     he planted many a tree of liberty that shall live through the\r\n     ages to come, overshadowing in a measure his failure to recognize\r\n     the divine right of political equality for woman in his later\r\n     days.\r\n\r\n     The first annual convention of the Oregon State Association met\r\n     in Portland, February 9, 1873. Many ladies and several\r\n     gentlemen[510] of more or less local prominence assisted at this\r\n     convention, but we were able to prevail upon but one gentleman,\r\n     Col. C. A. Reed of Salem, to occupy the platform with us. This\r\n     convention received favorable notice from the respectable press\r\n     of the State, and was largely attended by the best elements of\r\n     the city and country. Delegates were chosen to attend the\r\n     forthcoming State Temperance Alliance which held its second\r\n     annual meeting February 20, and to which a dozen of us went\r\n     bearing credentials. It was evident from the first that trouble\r\n     was brewing. The enemy had had a whole year to prepare an\r\n     ambuscade of which our party had no suspicion. A Committee on\r\n     Credentials was appointed with instructions to rule the woman\r\n     suffrage delegation out of the Alliance as a \"disturbing\r\n     element.\" Hon J. Quinn Thornton was chairman of that committee.\r\n     In his report he declared all delegations to be satisfactory\r\n     (including those from the penitentiary) except the women whom he\r\n     styled \"setting hens,\" \"belligerent females,\" etc., after which\r\n     he subsided with pompous gravity. All eyes were turned upon me,\r\n     and I felt as I fancy a general must when the success or failure\r\n     of an army in battle depends upon his word. \"Mr. President,\" I\r\n     exclaimed, as soon as I could get the floor, \"I move to so amend\r\n     the report of the committee as to admit the suffrage delegation.\"\r\n     The motion was seconded by a half-dozen voices. Then followed a\r\n     scene which beggars description. It was pandemonium broken loose.\r\n     When I arose again to address the chair that worthy ordered my\r\n     arrest by the sergeant-at-arms, saying: \"Take that crazy woman\r\n     out of the house and take care of her.\" The officer came forward\r\n     in discharge of his duty, but he quailed before my uplifted\r\n     pencil, and several gentlemen stepped into the aisle and began\r\n     drawing off their coats to defend me, among them a veteran\r\n     minister of the gospel. I smiled and bowed my thanks, and as\r\n     nobody could hear a word amid the uproar I complacently took my\r\n     seat while the officer skulked away, crestfallen. All that day\r\n     and evening, and until one o'clock the next afternoon, a noisy\r\n     rabble of self-styled temperance men sought to prevent bringing\r\n     the question to a square and honorable vote. Major George\r\n     Williams, a brave man who had lost a limb in fighting for his\r\n     country, at last succeeded in wearying the chairman into a\r\n     semblance of duty. The result was a triumph for the advocates of\r\n     suffrage. A recess was then taken, during which my hand was so\r\n     often and enthusiastically shaken that my shoulder was severely\r\n     lamed. The first thing in order after resuming business was my\r\n     report as Legislative Committee. I advanced to the platform amid\r\n     deafening cheers and, as soon as I could make myself heard, said,\r\n     in substance, that the legislature had decided that it was an\r\n     insult to womanhood to grant women the right to vote on\r\n     intemperance and debar them from voting on all honorable\r\n     questions. I then offered a fair and unequivocal woman suffrage\r\n     resolution, which was triumphantly carried. The disappointed\r\n     minority seceded from the Alliance and set up a \"Union\" for\r\n     themselves; but their confederacy did not live long, and its few\r\n     followers finally returned to their _alma mater_ and gave us no\r\n     further trouble.\r\n\r\n     Woman suffrage associations were formed in several counties\r\n     during the year 1874. Our strength was now much increased by the\r\n     able assistance of Mrs. H. A. Loughary, who suddenly took her\r\n     place in the front rank as a platform speaker. The editorial work\r\n     of the _New Northwest_ received a valuable auxiliary in June of\r\n     this year in the person of Catharine A. Coburn, a lady of rare\r\n     journalistic ability, who held her position five years, when my\r\n     sons, W. S., H. R. and W. C. Duniway, having completed their\r\n     school duties and attained their majority, were admitted to\r\n     partnership in the business. Mrs. Coburn now holds a situation on\r\n     the editorial staff of the _Daily Oregonian_.\r\n\r\n     In the autumn of 1876 I was absent at the Centennial Exposition,\r\n     whither I had gone in the summer in response to an invitation\r\n     from the National Woman Suffrage Association to \"Come over into\r\n     Macedonia and help.\" The work for equal rights made favorable\r\n     headway in the legislature of Oregon that year through the\r\n     influence of a convention held at Salem under the able leadership\r\n     of Mrs. H. A. Loughary and Dr. Mary A. Thompson.\r\n\r\n     In June, 1878, a convention met in Walla Walla, Washington\r\n     territory, for the purpose of forming a constitution for the\r\n     proposed new State of Washington, and in compliance with the\r\n     invitation of many prominent women of the territory I visited the\r\n     convention and was permitted to present a memorial in person,\r\n     praying that the word \"male\" be omitted from the fundamental law\r\n     of the incubating State. But my plea (like that of Abigail Adams\r\n     a century before) failed of success, through a close vote\r\n     however--it stood 8 to 7--and men went on as before, saying, as\r\n     they did in the beginning: \"Women do not wish to vote. If they\r\n     desire the ballot let them ask for it.\" In September of that year\r\n     I was again at my post in the Oregon legislature circulating the\r\n     _New Northwest_ among the law-makers, and doing what else I could\r\n     to keep the cause before them in a manner to enlist their\r\n     confidence and command their respect. An opportunity was given me\r\n     at this session to make an extended argument upon constitutional\r\n     liberty before a joint convention of the two Houses, which\r\n     occupied an hour in delivery and was accorded profound attention.\r\n     I was much opposed to the growing desire of the legislature to\r\n     shirk its responsibility upon the voters at large by submitting a\r\n     proposed constitutional amendment to them when the constitution\r\n     nowhere prohibits women from voting, and I labored to show that\r\n     all we need is a declaratory act extending to us the franchise\r\n     under the existing fundamental law. Dr. Mary A. Thompson followed\r\n     in a brief speech and was courteously received. The Married\r\n     Woman's Property bill, passed in 1874, received some necessary\r\n     amendments at this session, and an act entitling women to vote\r\n     upon school questions and making them eligible to school offices,\r\n     was passed by a triumphant majority.\r\n\r\n     I went to Southern Oregon in 1879, and while sojourning in\r\n     Jacksonville was assailed with a shower of eggs (since known in\r\n     that section as \"Jacksonville arguments\") and was also burned in\r\n     effigy on a principal street after the sun went down.\r\n     Jacksonville is an old mining town, beautifully situated in the\r\n     heart of the Southern Oregon mountains, and has no connection\r\n     with the outside world except through the daily stagecoaches. Its\r\n     would-be leading men are old miners or refugees from the\r\n     bushwhacking district whence they were driven by the civil war.\r\n     The taint of slavery is yet upon them and the methods of\r\n     border-ruffians are their hearts' delight. It is true that there\r\n     are many good people among them, but they are often over-awed by\r\n     the lawless crowd whose very instincts lead them to oppose a\r\n     republican form of government. But that raid of the outlaws\r\n     proved a good thing for the woman suffrage movement. It aroused\r\n     the better classes, and finally shamed the border ruffians by its\r\n     own reaection. When I returned to Portland a perfect ovation\r\n     awaited me. Hundreds of men and women who had not before allied\r\n     themselves with the movement made haste to do so. The newspapers\r\n     were filled with severe denunciations of the mob, and\r\n     \"Jackson-villains,\" as the perpetrators of the outrage were\r\n     styled, grew heartily disgusted over their questionable glory.\r\n\r\n     When the legislature met in the autumn of 1880 it was decided by\r\n     the Woman Suffrage Association that we could \"raise the blockade\"\r\n     and encourage agitation in the work by consenting to an attempt\r\n     to amend the State constitution. Pursuant to this decision a\r\n     resolution was offered in the Senate by Hon. W. C. Fulton of\r\n     Clatsop, and in the House by Hon. Lee Laughlin, which, after\r\n     considerable discussion _pro_ and _con_ in which I was graciously\r\n     invited to participate on the floor of both Houses, was passed by\r\n     the requisite two-thirds majority. The result was considered a\r\n     triumph for the cause. A grand ratification jubilee was held in\r\n     the opera-house in honor of the event, and resolutions of thanks\r\n     to the lawmakers were passed, accompanied by many expressions of\r\n     faith in the legislation of the future.\r\n\r\n     In the meantime the work was going steadily on in Washington\r\n     territory, my own labors being distributed about equally between\r\n     the two sections of the Pacific Northwest that had formerly been\r\n     united under one territorial government. In the autumn of 1881\r\n     the legislature of Washington met one afternoon in joint\r\n     convention to listen to arguments from Hon. William H. White and\r\n     myself, on which occasion I held the floor for nearly three\r\n     hours, in the midst of an auditory that was itself an\r\n     inspiration. Mr. White, a Democrat of the old school, and now\r\n     (1885) holding the office of United States marshal in the\r\n     territory, under commission from President Cleveland, based his\r\n     plea for woman suffrage upon the enfranchisement of the colored\r\n     men, urging it strongly as a means of Democratic retaliation. The\r\n     suffrage bill passed in the House on the following day by a\r\n     majority of two, but was defeated in the Council by a majority of\r\n     two, showing that the vote would have been a tie if taken under\r\n     the joint-ballot rule.\r\n\r\n     Returning to Oregon I renewed the contest, and in the autumn of\r\n     1882 we were all gratified by the passage of the pending\r\n     constitutional amendment by a very nearly unanimous vote of each\r\n     House. Then the Oregon campaign began in earnest. The question\r\n     had assumed formidable proportions and was no longer an ignored\r\n     issue. The work went on with accelerated speed, and as far as\r\n     could be ascertained there was little or no opposition to it. The\r\n     meetings were largely attended and affirmative speakers were\r\n     ready to assist at all times, the help of this kind representing\r\n     all grades of the professions, led by the best and most\r\n     influential men of the State everywhere.\r\n\r\n     Another year went by, and the time for assembling the Washington\r\n     territory legislature was again at hand. Immediately upon\r\n     arriving at Olympia I learned that a coterie of politicians,\r\n     finding open hostility no longer effectual, had combined to crush\r\n     the woman suffrage bill, which had passed the House triumphantly,\r\n     by lobbying a \"substitute\" through the Council. In pursuance of\r\n     this seemingly plausible idea they talked with the ladies of\r\n     Olympia and succeeded in convincing a few of them that all women,\r\n     and especially all leaders of the movement, must be kept away\r\n     from the capitol or the bill would certainly be defeated.\r\n     Several women who ought to have have known better were deceived\r\n     by these specious pleaders, and but for some years of experience\r\n     in legislative assemblies that had brought me to comprehend the\r\n     \"ways that are dark and tricks that are vain,\" for which the\r\n     average politician is \"peculiar,\" the ruse would have succeeded.\r\n     I remained at headquarters, enduring alike the open attacks of\r\n     the venal press and the more covert opposition of the saloons and\r\n     brothels, and, as vigilantly as I could, watched all legislative\r\n     movements, taking much pains to keep the public mind excited\r\n     through the columns of the _Daily Oregonian_ and the weekly\r\n     issues of the _New Northwest_. The bill, which had been prepared\r\n     by Professor William H. Roberts, passed the House early in the\r\n     session; but it tarried long in the Council, and those most\r\n     interested were well-nigh worn out with work and watching before\r\n     the measure reached a vote. It came up for final passage November\r\n     15, 1883, when only three or four women were present. The Council\r\n     had been thoroughly canvassed before-hand and no member offered\r\n     to make a speech for or against it. The deathly stillness of the\r\n     chamber was broken only by the clerk's call of the names and the\r\n     firm responses of the \"ayes\" and \"noes.\" I kept the tally with a\r\n     nervous hand, and my heart fairly stood still as the fateful\r\n     moment came that gave us the majority. Then I arose and without\r\n     exchanging words with any one left the state-house and rushed\r\n     toward the telegraph-office, half a mile distant, my feet seeming\r\n     to tread the air. Judge J. W. Range of Cheney, president of a\r\n     local woman suffrage society, overtook me on the way, bound on\r\n     the same errand. He spoke, and I felt as if called back to earth\r\n     with a painful reminder that I was yet mortal. A few minutes more\r\n     and my message was on the way to the _New Northwest_. It was\r\n     publication-day and the paper had gone to press, but my jubilant\r\n     and faithful sons opened the forms and inserted the news, and in\r\n     less than half an hour the newsboys were crying the fact through\r\n     the streets of Portland, making the _New Northwest_, which had\r\n     fought the fight and led the work to the point where legislation\r\n     could give a victory, the very first paper in the nation to\r\n     herald the news to the world. The rejoicing in Oregon, as well as\r\n     in Washington territory, was most inspiriting. A bloodless battle\r\n     had been fought and won, and the enemy, asleep in carnal\r\n     security, had been surrendered unawares. The women of Oregon\r\n     thanked God and took courage.\r\n\r\n     After passing the Council the bill passed leisurely, and some of\r\n     us feared perilously, through the various stages of clerical\r\n     progress till November 22, when it received the signature of\r\n     Governor William A. Newell, who used a gold pen presented him for\r\n     the purpose by women whom his act made free. And when at a given\r\n     signal the church bells rang in glad acclaim, and the loud boom\r\n     of minute-guns reverberated from the forest-clothed hills that\r\n     border Puget Sound and lost itself at last in the faint echoes of\r\n     the far-off hights, the scroll of the dead century unrolled\r\n     before my inner vision and I beheld in spirit another scene on\r\n     the further verge of the continent, when men in designing to ring\r\n     the bell at Independence Hall in professed honor of the triumph\r\n     of liberty, although not a woman in the land was free, had sought\r\n     in vain to force the loyal metal into glad responses; for the\r\n     old bell quivered in every nerve and broke its heart rather than\r\n     tell a lie!\r\n\r\n     An immense ratification jubilee was held in the evening of the\r\n     same day at the city hall in Olympia, with many distinguished\r\n     speakers.[511] Similar meetings were subsequently held in all the\r\n     principal towns of the Pacific Northwest. The freed women of\r\n     Washington thankfully accepted their new prerogatives. They were\r\n     appointed as jurors in many localities, and have ever since\r\n     performed their duties with eminent satisfaction to judges,\r\n     lawyers and all clients who are seeking to obey the laws. But\r\n     their jurisdiction soon became decidedly uncomfortable for the\r\n     law-breaking elements, which speedily escaped to Oregon, where,\r\n     as the sequel proved, they began a secret and effective war upon\r\n     the pending constitutional amendment. We all knew we had a\r\n     formidable foe to fight at the ballot-box. Our own hands were\r\n     tied and our own guns spiked, while our foe was armed to the\r\n     teeth with ballots, backed by money and controlled by vice,\r\n     bigotry and tyranny. But the leading men of the State had long\r\n     been known to favor the amendment; the respectable press had\r\n     become mildly, and in a few cases earnestly acquiescent; no\r\n     opposition could be raised at any of our public meetings, and we\r\n     felt measurably sure of a victory until near election time, when\r\n     we discovered to our dismay that most of the leading politicians\r\n     upon whom we had relied for aid had suddenly been seized with an\r\n     alarming reticence. They ceased to attend the public meetings and\r\n     in every possible way ignored the amendment, lest by openly\r\n     allying themselves with it they might lose votes; and as all of\r\n     them were posing in some way for office, for themselves or\r\n     friends, and women had no votes with which to repay their\r\n     allegiance, it was not strange that they should thus desert us.\r\n\r\n     Our Republican senator in congress, Hon. J. N. Dolph, favored the\r\n     Woman Suffrage Association with an able and comprehensive letter,\r\n     which was widely circulated, urging the adoption of the amendment\r\n     as a measure of justice and right, and appealing to the voters to\r\n     make Oregon the banner State of the great reform. Leading\r\n     clergymen, especially of Portland, preached in favor of woman\r\n     suffrage, prominent among them being Rev. T. L. Eliot, pastor of\r\n     the Unitarian church; Chaplain R. S. Stubbs of the Church of Sea\r\n     and Land, and Rev. Frederic R. Marvin of the First Congregational\r\n     society. Appeals to voters were widely circulated from the pens\r\n     and speeches of many able gentlemen.[512] Not one influential man\r\n     made audible objection anywhere.\r\n\r\n     We had carefully districted and organized the State, sparing\r\n     neither labor nor money in providing \"Yes\" tickets for all\r\n     parties and all candidates and putting them everywhere in the\r\n     hands of friends for use at the polls. But the polls were no\r\n     sooner open than it began to appear that the battle was one of\r\n     great odds. Masked batteries were opened in almost every\r\n     precinct, and multitudes of legal voters who are rarely seen in\r\n     daylight except at a general election, many of whom were refugees\r\n     from Washington territory, crowded forth from their hiding-places\r\n     to strike the manacled women down. They accused the earnest\r\n     ladies who had dared to ask for simple justice of every crime in\r\n     the social catalogue. Railroad gangs were driven to the polls\r\n     like sheep and voted against us in battalions. But, in spite of\r\n     all this, nearly one-third of the vote was thrown in our favor,\r\n     requiring a change of only about one-fourth of the opposing vote\r\n     to have given us a victory, and proving to the amazement of our\r\n     enemies that the strength of our cause was already\r\n     formidable.[513] We were repulsed but not conquered. Before the\r\n     smoke of the battle had cleared away we had called immense\r\n     meetings and passed vigorous resolutions, thanking the lovers of\r\n     liberty who had favored us with their suffrages, and pledging\r\n     ourselves anew to the conflict.\r\n\r\n     We at once decided that we would never again permit the\r\n     legislature to remand us to the rabble in a vain appeal for\r\n     justice. We had demonstrated the impossibility of receiving a\r\n     fair, impartial vote at the hands of the ignorant, lawless and\r\n     unthinking multitude whose ballots outweigh all reason and\r\n     overpower all sense. In pursuance of this purpose I went to the\r\n     legislature of 1885 and found no difficulty in securing the aid\r\n     of friendly members of both Houses who kindly championed the\r\n     following bill:\r\n\r\n          _Be it enacted by the Legislative Assembly of Oregon:_\r\n\r\n          That the elective franchise shall not hereafter be denied to\r\n          any person in this State on account of sex.\r\n\r\n          This act to be in force from and after its approval by the\r\n          governor.\r\n\r\n     After much parliamentary fillibustering the vote of both Houses\r\n     was recorded upon this bill and stood conjointly 34 to 54. This\r\n     vote, coming so soon after our defeat at the polls, is regarded\r\n     as the greatest victory we have yet won. The ablest lawyers of\r\n     the State and of Washington territory are preparing elaborate\r\n     opinions showing the constitutionality of our present plan, and\r\n     these are to be published in the form of a standard work, with\r\n     appropriate references for convenient use. The movement exhibits\r\n     a healthy, steady and encouraging growth, and is much accelerated\r\n     by its success in Washington territory.\r\n\r\n     On the Fourth of July of this year a grand celebration was held\r\n     at Vancouver, on Washington soil, the women of Oregon having\r\n     resolved in large numbers that they would never again unite in\r\n     celebrating men's independence-day in a State where they are\r\n     denied their liberty. The celebration was a success from first to\r\n     last. Boys and girls in equal numbers rode in the liberty-car and\r\n     represented the age of the government. The military post at\r\n     Vancouver joined heartily in the festivities, headed by the\r\n     gallant soldier, General Nelson A. Miles, commander-in-chief of\r\n     the department of the Columbia. The fine Fourteenth Infantry Band\r\n     furnished the instrumental music, and a local choir rendered\r\n     spirited choruses. The New Declaration of Independence was read\r\n     by Josie De Vore Johnson, the oration was delivered by Mattie A.\r\n     Bridge, and Louise Lester, the famous _prima donna_, electrified\r\n     the delighted crowd by her triumphant rendition of the\r\n     \"Star-Spangled Banner.\" The exercises closed with the\r\n     announcement by the writer, who had officiated as president of\r\n     the day, that the Executive Committee of the Oregon Woman\r\n     Suffrage Association had, during the noon recess, adopted the\r\n     following resolutions:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That our thanks are due to General Nelson A.\r\n          Miles of the department of the Columbia for his valuable\r\n          cooeperation in the exercises and entertainments of this\r\n          historic day.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That we thank the citizens of Clarke County, and\r\n          especially of Vancouver, for their hospitality and kindness,\r\n          so graciously bestowed upon their less fortunate Oregon\r\n          neighbors, who have not yet achieved their full\r\n          independence, and we shall ever cherish their fraternal\r\n          recognition in grateful remembrance.\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That while we deplore the injustice that still\r\n          deprives the women of Oregon of the liberty to exercise\r\n          their right to the elective franchise, we rejoice in the\r\n          record the women of Washington are making as citizens, as\r\n          voters and as jurors. We congratulate them upon their\r\n          newly-acquired liberties, and especially upon the\r\n          intelligent and conscientious manner in which they are\r\n          discharging the important public duties that in no wise\r\n          interfere with their home affairs. And we are further\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That if our own fathers, husbands, sons and\r\n          brothers do not at the next session of the Oregon\r\n          legislature bestow upon us the same electoral privileges\r\n          which the women of Washington already enjoy, we will prepare\r\n          to cross the Columbia River and take up our permanent abode\r\n          in this \"land of the free and home of the brave.\"\r\n\r\n     The resolutions evoked cheers that waked the echoes, and the\r\n     celebration, reported by the Oregon press, contributed largely to\r\n     the growth of the equal-rights sentiment among the people of the\r\n     State. Two stanzas of a spirited poem are subjoined, written for\r\n     the Woman Suffrage Association just after our defeat at the\r\n     polls, by a young man from Southern Oregon who has withheld his\r\n     own name but included the names of all the counties in his\r\n     glorious prophecy:\r\n\r\n          From Clatsop and from Clackamas, from Linn and Tillamook;\r\n          From Grant, Multnomah, Lane and Coos, and Benton, Lake and\r\n              Crook;\r\n          From Josephine, Columbia, and loyal Washington,\r\n          And Union, Baker and Yamhill, and proud old Marion;\r\n          From where the Cascade mountain-streams their foaming waters\r\n              pour,\r\n          We're coming, mothers, sisters, dear, \"ten times ten thousand\r\n              more.\"\r\n\r\n          From Klamath's lakes and Wasco's plains, and Jackson's rolling\r\n              hills;\r\n          From Douglas with her mines of gold, and Curry with her mills;\r\n          From Umatilla's burdened fields, and hills and dales of Polk,\r\n          We're coming with our votes and songs to break the tyrant's\r\n              yoke,\r\n          And in the ears of Liberty this song of joy we'll pour,\r\n          We're coming, mothers, sisters, dear, \"ten times ten thousand\r\n              more.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary Olney Brown gives an amusing account of her attempts to\r\nvote in Washington territory. The incidents related occurred\r\nseveral years before the passage of the act specifically\r\nenfranchising women. She says:\r\n\r\n     I do not think there has ever been a session of our legislature\r\n     that has not had before it the subject of woman suffrage. It has\r\n     been my habit to write out, and send to all parts of the\r\n     territory, before the assembling of each legislature, petitions\r\n     to be signed, asking for a law guaranteeing to women the\r\n     exercise of their right to vote. These petitions were not without\r\n     their effect, though no one knew who sent them out, or, when\r\n     returned, who selected the member to receive and present them to\r\n     the legislature. At the session of 1867, mainly through the\r\n     efforts of Edward Eldridge of Whatcom County, an act was passed\r\n     giving \"all white American citizens above the age of twenty-one\r\n     years\" the right to vote. This law is still on our statute books;\r\n     but, like the fourteenth amendment, is interpreted to mean only\r\n     male citizens. During the time between the passage of this law\r\n     and the next election, I wrote to some of the prominent women of\r\n     the principal towns, telling them of the law, and urging them to\r\n     go out and vote at the coming election, and also to induce as\r\n     many more to go as they could. But no notice was taken of my\r\n     letters. I was looked upon as a fanatic, and the idea of a woman\r\n     voting was regarded as an absurdity. The law seemed to be in\r\n     advance of the people. It needed lectures and organized societies\r\n     among us to educate the women into a just appreciation of their\r\n     rights and duties.\r\n\r\n     In the autumn of 1868, Dr. Smith wrote several articles on the\r\n     right of women to the ballot, as did also Mr. Eldridge. The\r\n     latter asserted that it was the intention of the law to give the\r\n     women of the territory the right to vote; that being a member of\r\n     the legislature he had purposely stated in his remarks, that if\r\n     the bill passed in that form, it would give the women the right\r\n     to vote; and a member from his seat cried out, \"That is what we\r\n     want!\" Mr. Eldridge urged the women to go out to the polls and\r\n     vote. These articles were published in the Olympia _Transcript_,\r\n     the Republican paper, J. N. Gale, one of the editors, being an\r\n     advocate of suffrage. Still not a woman made a move. Many wished\r\n     to vote; they knew it was the only way to secure their rights,\r\n     and yet they had not the courage to go to the polls in defiance\r\n     of custom.\r\n\r\n     Seeing this to be the case, and knowing that if anything was done\r\n     some one must take the initiative, I determined to cast aside my\r\n     timidity and set the ball rolling. Accordingly, several weeks\r\n     before the election of 1869 I gave out word that I was going to\r\n     the polls to vote. I had the previous year removed with my family\r\n     from Olympia, and was living on White River in King county. The\r\n     announcement that I would attend the election caused a great\r\n     commotion in White River precinct. A fearful hue and cry was\r\n     raised. The news reached Olympia and Seaettle, and some of the\r\n     papers deprecated the idea that \"a woman should unsex herself by\r\n     dabbling in the filthy pool of politics.\" But I was fully\r\n     committed. The law had been on our statute books for nearly three\r\n     years. If it was intended for our benefit, it was time we were\r\n     availing ourselves of it. So, nothing daunted, I determined to\r\n     repair to the polling place, the district school-house,\r\n     accompanied by my husband, my daughter (Mrs. Axtell) and her\r\n     husband--a little band of four--looked upon with pity and\r\n     contempt for what was called our \"fanaticism.\"\r\n\r\n     For several days before the election the excitement in the\r\n     neighborhood and other settlements along the river was intense.\r\n     Many gentlemen called on me and tried to persuade me to stay at\r\n     home and save myself from insult. I thanked them for their\r\n     kindness, and told them I fully appreciated their good\r\n     intentions, but that I had associated with men all my life, and\r\n     had always been treated as a lady; that the men I should meet at\r\n     the polls were the same that I met in church and social\r\n     gatherings, and I knew they would treat me with respect. Then\r\n     they begged my husband not to allow me to go; but he told them\r\n     his wife had as good a right to vote as he had; and that no\r\n     citizen can legally deprive another of the right to vote.\r\n\r\n     On the morning of the election, just before we reached the\r\n     school-house, a man met us and said, \"Mr. Brown, look here now!\r\n     If Mrs. Brown goes up to vote she will be insulted! If I was in\r\n     your place I wouldn't let her go any farther. She had better go\r\n     back.\" My husband answered, \"Mr. Brannan, my wife has as good a\r\n     right to vote as I have, and I would not prevent her if I could.\r\n     She has a mind of her own and will do as she thinks best, and I\r\n     shall stand by her and see that she is well treated! Besides\r\n     [speaking with emphasis], she will not be insulted either!\"\r\n     \"Well,\" said the man, \"if she was my wife she shouldn't go!\r\n     She'll be sure to be insulted!\" I looked him full in the face,\r\n     and said with decision, \"Mr. Brannan, a gentleman will be a\r\n     gentleman under all circumstances, and will always treat a lady\r\n     with respect.\" I said this because I knew the man, and knew that\r\n     if anyone offered any annoyance, it would be he, and so it\r\n     proved.\r\n\r\n     As we drove up to the school-house and alighted, a man in an\r\n     angry voice snapped out, \"Well! if the women are coming to vote,\r\n     I'm going home!\" But he did not go; he had too much curiosity; he\r\n     wanted to see the fun. He stayed and was converted. After\r\n     watching the sovereign \"white male citizen\" perform the laborious\r\n     task of depositing his vote in the ballot-box, I thought if I\r\n     braced myself up I might be equal to the task. So, summoning all\r\n     my strength, I walked up to the desk behind which sat the august\r\n     officers of election, and presented my vote. When behold! I was\r\n     pompously met with the assertion, \"You are not an American\r\n     citizen; hence not entitled to vote.\" The great unabridged\r\n     dictionary of Noah Webster was opened, and the definition of the\r\n     word citizen read to me. They all looked to see me vanquished;\r\n     they thought I would have to retreat before such an overwhelming\r\n     array of sagacity. The countenances of the judges wore a pleased\r\n     expression that they had hit on so easy an expedient to put me\r\n     _hors du combat_, while the crowd looked astonished that I did\r\n     not sink out of sight. Waiting a moment, I said, \"The definition\r\n     is correct. A citizen of the United States, is a _person_ owing\r\n     allegiance to the government; but then all persons are not _men_;\r\n     and the definition of \"citizeness\" is a female citizen. I claim\r\n     to be an American citizen, and a native-born citizen at that; and\r\n     I wish to show you from the fourteenth amendment to the\r\n     constitution of the United States, that women are not only\r\n     citizens having the constitutional right to vote, but also that\r\n     our territorial election law gives women the privilege of\r\n     exercising that right.\"\r\n\r\n     When I commenced speaking, all the men, with the exception of\r\n     two--the one who had urged my husband not to let me go to the\r\n     school-house, and a low, degraded fellow, who had a squaw for a\r\n     wife--came and ranged themselves around me and the judges before\r\n     whom I stood, and listened attentively. It was a new subject to\r\n     them. They had heard of woman suffrage, but only in ridicule. Now\r\n     it was being presented to them in a very different light. As I\r\n     proceeded there was a death-like stillness, so intent were they\r\n     to catch every word. Even the man who had declared he would go\r\n     home if the women were going to vote, was among the most\r\n     interested of the listeners. There was but one interruption; the\r\n     two men, of whom I have spoken, to make good their assertion that\r\n     I would be insulted, got behind a desk in the far corner of the\r\n     room, and began talking and laughing very loudly; but they were\r\n     promptly called to order. Silence being restored, I went on to\r\n     show them that the original constitution recognized women as\r\n     citizens, and that the word citizen includes both sexes, as is\r\n     proved by the phrases, \"male citizen,\" and \"female citizen\"; that\r\n     women from the beginning had been unjustly deprived of the\r\n     exercise of their constitutional rights; that they had for years\r\n     been petitioning those in power to restore them to their\r\n     political freedom, when the emancipation of the Southern slaves\r\n     threw upon the country a class of people, who, like the women of\r\n     the nation, owed allegiance to the government, but whose\r\n     citizenship was not recognized. To settle this question, the\r\n     fourteenth amendment was adopted. Its first section declares\r\n     emphatically who are citizens, and guarantees to them the\r\n     exercise of all their natural rights under the equal protection\r\n     of the law. (Here I read to them the section.) No distinction is\r\n     made in regard to sex; the word \"person\" being used, which\r\n     includes both men and women.\r\n\r\n     \"And now, honorable gentlemen,\" I said, in conclusion, \"I am a\r\n     'person,' declared by the fourteenth amendment to be a citizen,\r\n     and still further, I am a native-born citizen of the same race\r\n     and color of these gentlemen by whom I am surrounded, and whose\r\n     votes you do not hesitate to receive; and, had our territorial\r\n     law failed to give me the right to vote, this amendment would\r\n     protect me in the exercise of it. I again offer my vote, and hope\r\n     you will not refuse it.\" No hand was extended to receive it; but\r\n     one of the judges threw himself back in his seat, and with great\r\n     dignity of manner and an immense display of ignorance, exclaimed,\r\n     \"Women have no right to vote; and the laws of Congress don't\r\n     extend over Washington territory.\" This was too much for even the\r\n     strongest opponents. On every side was heard, \"Oh, Mr. Alvord!\r\n     why, yes, they do!\" \"Mr. Alvord, you are mistaken, the laws of\r\n     congress do extend over our territory\"; and some tried to explain\r\n     to him that the territory belonged to the United States and was\r\n     under the jurisdiction of the national government, and that of\r\n     course the laws of congress extended over it. But still more\r\n     pompously, he again declared, \"It is no such thing, the laws of\r\n     congress don't extend over Washington territory.\" A look of\r\n     disgust and shame was depicted on nearly every countenance, and\r\n     the cause of woman suffrage had advanced perceptibly in the minds\r\n     of the audience.\r\n\r\n     Another of the judges arose, and said, he had never thought much\r\n     on the subject. He had no doubt but Mrs. Brown was right, woman\r\n     were citizens and had the right to vote; but as the courts had\r\n     not instructed the election officers to take the votes of women,\r\n     and as the precinct was a small one, he was afraid their whole\r\n     vote would be thrown out if they received the women's ballots.\r\n     So, although he should like to see the women have their rights,\r\n     he should have to refuse Mrs. Brown's vote. Here an Irishman\r\n     called out, \"It would be more sensible to let an intelligent\r\n     white woman vote than an ignorant nigger.\" Cries of \"Good for\r\n     you, Pat! good for you, Pat!\" indicated the impression that had\r\n     been made. My daughter now went up and offered her vote, which\r\n     was, of course, rejected.\r\n\r\n     My going to the polls was noised abroad, and set men as well as\r\n     women thinking. They examined the law for themselves, and found\r\n     that women had a right to vote, so that before the next election\r\n     many were prepared to act. In May, 1870, I published an appeal to\r\n     the women of the territory, quoting to them the law, and urging\r\n     them to avail themselves of its provisions by going to the polls\r\n     and voting. My sister, Charlotte Olney French, living in Grand\r\n     Mound precinct, some twenty-five miles from Olympia, began\r\n     talking the matter up; and, being a woman of energy and\r\n     influence, she soon had the whole neighborhood interested. With\r\n     the assistance of an old lady, Mrs. Peck, she planned a regular\r\n     campaign. By the programme the women were to get up a picnic\r\n     dinner at the school-house where the election was to be held, and\r\n     directly after, while the officers of election were in good humor\r\n     (wives will understand the philosophy of this), they were to\r\n     present their votes. My sister, being a good talker and well\r\n     informed on all the constitutional, judicial and social phases of\r\n     the question as well as a good judge of human nature, was able to\r\n     meet and parry every objection, and give information where\r\n     needed, so that by the time dinner was over, the judges, as well\r\n     as everybody else, were in the best of spirits. When the voting\r\n     was resumed, the women (my sister being the first) handed in\r\n     their ballots as if they had always been accustomed to voting,\r\n     and everything passed off pleasantly. One lady, Mrs. Sargent,\r\n     seventy-two years old, said she thanked the Lord that He had let\r\n     her live until she could vote. She had often prayed to see the\r\n     day, and now she was proud to cast her first ballot.\r\n\r\n     It had been talked of for some days before the election in the\r\n     adjoining precinct--Black River--that Mrs. French was organizing\r\n     a party of women to attend the election in Grand Mound precinct;\r\n     but they were not sure the judges would let them vote. \"If they\r\n     do,\" said they, \"if the Grand Mound women vote, the Black River\r\n     women shall!\" So they stationed a man on a fleet horse, at the\r\n     Grand Mound polls, with instructions to start as soon as the\r\n     women began to vote, and ride with all haste back to their\r\n     precinct and let them know. The moment the man rode in sight of\r\n     the school-house he swung his hat, and screeched at the top of\r\n     his voice, \"They're voting! They're voting!\" The teams were all\r\n     ready in anticipation of the news, and were instantly flying in\r\n     every direction, and soon the women were ushered into the\r\n     school-house, their choice of tickets furnished them, and all\r\n     allowed to vote as \"American citizens.\"\r\n\r\n     While the women of these two precincts were enjoying the exercise\r\n     of their political rights, the women of Olympia were suffering\r\n     the vexation of disappointment. I had been stopping there for\r\n     some weeks previous to the election, trying to induce the women\r\n     to go to the polls, and also to convince the men that women had a\r\n     legal right to vote, and that their right must be respected. The\r\n     day before election the judges were interviewed as to whether\r\n     they would take the votes of the women. They replied, \"Yes; we\r\n     shall be obliged to take them. The law gives them the right to\r\n     vote, and we can not refuse.\" This decision was heralded all over\r\n     the city, and women felt as if their millennium had come.\r\n     To-morrow, for the first time, their voice would be heard in the\r\n     government through the ballot. All day long women met each other,\r\n     and asked: \"Are you going to the election to-morrow?\" Groups\r\n     gathered in parlors and discussed the matter, and everything\r\n     seemed auspicious.\r\n\r\n     But how true the saying: \"There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and\r\n     the lip!\" Before nine o'clock the next morning, the word had been\r\n     communicated all over town that \"the women need not come out to\r\n     the polls as the judges would not take their votes.\" They would\r\n     give no reason why, but said \"they had decided not to take the\r\n     votes of the women.\" About a dozen of us gathered together to\r\n     consult what was best to be done; finding most of them inclined\r\n     to back out, I urged the necessity of our making an effort; that\r\n     whether the judges took our votes or not, it was not best to give\r\n     it up as the rest had done; if we did, it would be harder to make\r\n     an effort next time; that I had been to the polls once and had my\r\n     vote refused, and could be refused again; at any rate, I had the\r\n     right to vote, and I should go and offer it if I had to go alone.\r\n     Three of the number said they would go with me--Mrs. Patterson,\r\n     Mrs. Wiley and Mrs. Dofflemyer; these, with Mr. Patterson, my\r\n     husband and myself made our party. As we reached the court-house\r\n     where the election was held, Mr. Dofflemyer met us and took his\r\n     wife home, she meekly submitting.\r\n\r\n     Just before us a cart rattled up bearing a male citizen, who was\r\n     too drunk to know what he was doing, or even to do anything. He\r\n     was lying on his back in the cart, with feet and hands up,\r\n     hurrahing at the top of his voice. This disgusting, drunken idiot\r\n     was picked up out of the cart by two men, who put a ticket into\r\n     his hand, carried him to the window (he was too drunk to stand),\r\n     shoved him up and raised his arm into the aperture; his vote\r\n     received, he was tumbled back into the cart.\r\n\r\n     I then stepped up and offered my vote, and was answered with, \"We\r\n     have decided not to take the votes of the women!\" \"On what\r\n     grounds do you refuse?\" I asked. No answer. \"Do you refuse it on\r\n     legal grounds?\" Still no answer. I then said, \"Under the election\r\n     law of this territory, setting aside my constitutional right as a\r\n     citizen of the United States, I have the right to vote at this\r\n     election. Have you the election law by you?\" \"No, we have not got\r\n     it here,\" they said. I knew they had, but did not dispute their\r\n     word. \"Very well,\" I said, \"I can quote it for you.\" I did so,\r\n     and then said, \"Under this territorial law I claim my right, and\r\n     again I offer you my vote as an American citizen. If you doubt my\r\n     citizenship, I will insist on taking the oath. Will you receive\r\n     it?\" The answer was, \"No; we have decided not to take women's\r\n     votes, and we cannot take yours.\" \"Then,\" said I, \"it amounts to\r\n     this: the law gives women the right to vote in this territory,\r\n     and you three men who have been appointed to receive our votes,\r\n     sit here and arbitrarily refuse to take them, giving no reason\r\n     why, only that you have decided not to take the women's votes.\r\n     There is no law to sustain you in this usurpation of power. We\r\n     can claim legal redress. Are you willing to stand a legal\r\n     prosecution?\" \"Yes,\" was the response of each one separately. It\r\n     was now plain to see why the votes of the women were refused; the\r\n     judges had been hired to do the dirty work, and money pledged in\r\n     case of prosecution. They were men in moderate circumstances and\r\n     could not have stood the cost of a suit individually. The ready\r\n     assent they gave showed such a contingency had been thought of\r\n     and provided against by the opponents of woman suffrage. The\r\n     other two women then offered their votes, which were also\r\n     refused.\r\n\r\n     In the autumn of 1871 Susan B. Anthony came to Olympia and\r\n     attended the first woman suffrage convention ever held here. Our\r\n     legislature was in session, and a joint hearing before the two\r\n     Houses was extended to her. Her statesman-like argument clearly\r\n     proved the right of our women to vote under both the national\r\n     constitution and the territorial law. After Miss Anthony left,\r\n     there arose a rumor that the election law was to be repealed, and\r\n     a committee of women attended every session, determined if\r\n     possible to prevent it. They were at the capitol the last day,\r\n     prepared to stay until the adjournment; they were urged to go\r\n     home, but would not unless a solemn promise was made them that\r\n     the law should in no way be tampered with. This the members\r\n     refused to do, until a bright idea struck one of them, which was\r\n     that they need not disturb the law, but could make it inoperative\r\n     by enacting another statute. This being whispered among the\r\n     members, the promise was given, and the women retired.\r\n     Immediately after, the following act was passed by both Houses,\r\n     approved and signed by the governor:\r\n\r\n          _Be it enacted by the Legislative Assembly of the Territory\r\n          of Washington:_\r\n\r\n          SECTION 1. That hereafter no female shall have the right of\r\n          ballot, or vote at any poll or election precinct in this\r\n          territory until the Congress of the United States of America\r\n          shall, by direct legislation, declare the same to be the\r\n          supreme law of the land.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 2. This act to take effect from and after its passage.\r\n\r\n          Approved November 29, 1871.   EDWARD S. SOLOMON, _Governor_.\r\n\r\n     When the proclamation to hold a convention to form a constitution\r\n     preparatory to our admission into the Union as a State, was\r\n     issued, I recommended to the Territorial Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association that we make every effort to secure to the convention\r\n     as many delegates as possible in favor of woman suffrage, and\r\n     then that we circulate petitions asking them to leave out the\r\n     word \"male\" from the constitution. Failing to get the society to\r\n     take any associated action, I went to work individually, wrote\r\n     and sent out petitions into every town and country place where\r\n     there was a post-office, asking that the word \"male\" be left out\r\n     of the constitution. With each petition I sent a letter to the\r\n     person whose name I had procured from the postmaster of the\r\n     place, stating the object, urging a thorough circulation, and\r\n     directing its return at a given date to Mary Olney Brown,\r\n     President of the Washington Territorial Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association; thus giving the credit of the work to the Society.\r\n\r\n     I could not get a member of our Association to circulate the\r\n     petition in Olympia, so every day that I could get away from home\r\n     I took my petition in hand and canvassed for signatures. If I\r\n     went shopping or on an errand I took it with me, and in that way\r\n     I procured over 300 names. My experience had taught me that the\r\n     principal opposition to woman's voting came from ignorance as to\r\n     her true position under the government. She had come to be looked\r\n     upon almost as a foreign element in our nation, having no lot nor\r\n     part with the male citizen, and I felt that it was necessary to\r\n     disabuse the minds of the people generally, and the delegates to\r\n     the convention particularly, of this notion. I therefore wrote\r\n     five articles on the \"Equality of Citizenship,\" which Mrs.\r\n     Duniway kindly published in the _New Northwest_. The Olympia\r\n     _Courier_ also printed them, and placed the paper on file in the\r\n     city reading-room; and when I met a man who had not made up his\r\n     mind on the subject I recommended him to the reading-room, and\r\n     several after perusing the articles were converted and signed the\r\n     petition.\r\n\r\n     On the assembling of the legislature Mrs. A. H. H. Stuart and\r\n     myself watched a favorable opportunity to present an equal rights\r\n     bill. We let them talk up the matter pretty well over a petition\r\n     signed by fifty women of one of the upper counties, when one day\r\n     Mrs. Stuart came to me and said: \"Now, Mrs. Brown, write out your\r\n     bill; the speaker of the House sent me word they were ready for\r\n     it.\" I sat down and framed a bill[514] to the best of my ability,\r\n     which was duly presented and respectfully debated. Mrs. Duniway\r\n     came from Portland to urge its passage, and the day before it\r\n     came to a vote both Houses adjourned and invited her to speak in\r\n     the hall of representatives. She made one of her best speeches.\r\n     The members of both Houses were present, besides a large audience\r\n     from the city. The next day the House passed the bill by two\r\n     majority, and on the day following it was lost in the Council by\r\n     two majority. In the House the vote stood, ayes, 13; nays, 11. In\r\n     the Council, ayes, 5; nays, 7.\r\n\r\n     Saturday evening Mrs. Duniway made another telling speech in the\r\n     city hall, at the close of which Mr. White, a lobby member, made\r\n     a few remarks, in which he disclosed the cause of the defeat of\r\n     the bill in the Council. He said, after the bill passed the House\r\n     the saloon-keepers, alarmed lest their occupation would be gone\r\n     if women should vote, button-holed the members of the Council,\r\n     and as many of them as could be bought by drinks pledged\r\n     themselves to vote against the bill. The members of the Council\r\n     were present, and though an urgent invitation was given to all to\r\n     speak, not one of them denied the charge made by Mr. White. On\r\n     the following Monday an effort was made in the Council to\r\n     reconsider the bill, but failed. Thus stands our cause at\r\n     present. There will be a greater effort than ever before put\r\n     forth during the next two years to secure an affirmative vote in\r\n     our legislature.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Brown wrote the above in 1881, the promise in the closing\r\nsentence was really quite prophetic, since the legislature of 1883\r\npassed a law enfranchising the women of the territory.[515] Mrs.\r\nDuniway concludes her account with a brief reference to the work in\r\nneighboring territories:\r\n\r\n     In addition to all that is being done in Oregon and Washington,\r\n     we are actively engaged in pushing the work in Idaho and Montana\r\n     territories, where the _New Northwest_ has been thoroughly\r\n     circulated in many localities and many spirited public meetings\r\n     have been held. The Idaho legislature seriously considered and\r\n     came near adopting a woman suffrage bill last winter, and the\r\n     women of the territory are confidently awaiting a triumph at the\r\n     next biennial session. Remembering Dakota's set-back through the\r\n     governor's veto in 1885, they are carefully planning to avoid a\r\n     like calamity in their own territory. In Montana the cause has\r\n     made less apparent progress, but there is much quiet and\r\n     constantly increasing agitation in its favor. Popular feeling is\r\n     steadily ripening for the change, and let the rest of the world\r\n     wag as it will, there cannot be much longer hindrance to the\r\n     complete triumph of liberty in the Pacific Northwest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[507] Hon.

Merrick has furnished the following interesting\r\nfacts from her native State, for which we feel ourselves deeply\r\nindebted:\r\n\r\n     Like the children of one family the States have a common\r\n     resemblance, but they are various in character as in geographical\r\n     outline. In Louisiana the Anglo-American finds himself\r\n     side-by-side with inhabitants of French or Spanish descent, and\r\n     in many of the country parishes the African freedmen outnumber\r\n     all the rest.\r\n\r\n     St. Anna's Asylum in New Orleans is controlled and managed by a\r\n     board of directors composed entirely of women. Among the inmates\r\n     in 1878 was a German woman who had resided in the institution for\r\n     many years. Finding herself in ill-health and fearing the\r\n     approach of the end, she confided to the ladies of the board that\r\n     she had a thousand dollars in bank which she wished to bequeath\r\n     to the home where she had been provided for and sheltered so\r\n     long. At her earnest request a will was drawn up in accordance\r\n     with her wishes, and signed by members of the board who were\r\n     present as witnesses. Shortly after, the woman died and her will\r\n     was submitted to the proper authority for admission to probate.\r\n     When the ladies were duly informed that the will was null and\r\n     void, they naturally asked why, and were told that under\r\n     Louisiana law women were not lawful witnesses to a will. Had they\r\n     only called in the old darkey wood-sawyer, doing a day's work in\r\n     the asylum yard, and had him affix his mark to the paper, the\r\n     money would have accrued to the asylum; as it was, it went to the\r\n     State.\r\n\r\n     Early in 1879, when a convention to make a new State\r\n     constitution[516] had been called and was about to assemble in\r\n     New Orleans, Mrs. Merrick tried to arouse the ladies of the\r\n     board, representing to them that in the controlling power they\r\n     exercised over St. Anna's Asylum they were only children\r\n     _playing_ they were a part of the people and citizens of the\r\n     State, when in reality they were legally powerless to perform any\r\n     free and independent act. The ladies were mortified by the\r\n     position in which they found themselves but were not willing to\r\n     take any step to remedy their pitiful case, not even to sign the\r\n     petition which was afterwards drawn up by Mrs. Saxon and Mrs.\r\n     Merrick to present to the constitution-makers to have these\r\n     disabilities removed. The petition was as follows:\r\n\r\n          _To the Honorable President and Members of the Convention of\r\n          Louisiana, convened for the purpose of framing a new\r\n          Constitution:_\r\n\r\n          The undersigned, citizens of the State of Louisiana,\r\n          respectfully represent:\r\n\r\n          That up to the present time all women, of whatever age or\r\n          capacity, have been debarred from the right of\r\n          representation, notwithstanding the burdensome taxes which\r\n          they have paid.\r\n\r\n          They have been excluded from holding any office save in\r\n          cases of special tutorships in limited degree, or of\r\n          administration only in specified cases.\r\n\r\n          They have been debarred from being witnesses to wills or\r\n          notarial acts, even when executed by their own sex.\r\n\r\n          They look upon this condition of things as a grievance\r\n          proper to be brought before your honorable body for\r\n          consideration and relief.\r\n\r\n          As a question of civilization, we look upon the\r\n          enfranchisement of women as an all-important one. In\r\n          Wyoming, where it has been tried for ten years, the\r\n          law-makers and clergy unite in declaring that this influx of\r\n          women voters has done more to promote morality and order\r\n          than thousands of armed men could have accomplished.\r\n\r\n          Should the entire franchise seem too extended a privilege,\r\n          we most earnestly urge the adoption of a property\r\n          qualification, and that women may be allowed a vote on\r\n          school and educational matters, involving as they do the\r\n          interests of women and children in a great degree.\r\n\r\n          So large a proportion of the taxes of Louisiana is paid by\r\n          women, many of them without male representatives, that in\r\n          granting consideration and relief for grievances herein\r\n          complained of, the people will recognize justice and equity.\r\n          To woman as well as man \"taxation without representation is\r\n          tyranny,\" she being \"a person, a citizen, a freeholder, a\r\n          tax-payer,\" the same as man, only government has never held\r\n          out the same fostering, protecting hand to all alike, nor\r\n          ever will, until women are directly represented.\r\n\r\n          Wherefore, we, your petitioners, pray that some suitable\r\n          provision remedying these evils be incorporated in the\r\n          constitution you are about to frame.\r\n\r\n     While this petition was being circulated, favorable articles\r\n     appeared from time to time in the public prints. The following,\r\n     signed \"Fatima,\" the _nom de plume_ of Clara Merrick Guthrie,\r\n     appeared in the _Democrat_:\r\n\r\n          A well-known notary signed this petition with a flourish,\r\n          remarking that \"few women and not over half the men were\r\n          aware of the disabilities of wives and daughters.\"\r\n\r\n          If the convention should invest women of property with the\r\n          elective franchise it would give to the respectable side of\r\n          politics a large body of sensible voters which would go far\r\n          toward neutralizing the evil of unlimited male suffrage. The\r\n          policy in the Northern States has been to demand\r\n          unrestricted suffrage, but the women of Louisiana may with\r\n          propriety exhibit certain variations in the nature of their\r\n          appeal. This subject in all its phases inspires my\r\n          enthusiasm, but I dare not be as eloquent as I might, lest a\r\n          messenger should be sent to me with an urgent request to\r\n          address the convention next Monday evening. * * * *\r\n\r\n          _On dit._--Other ladies beside our brave Mrs. Saxon are\r\n          desired to give their views. Now surely the convention would\r\n          not ask these quiet house-mothers, who are not even remotely\r\n          akin to professional agitators, to do such violence to their\r\n          old-time precedents if the prospect of some reward were not\r\n          encouraging and immediate. Nothing could induce me to make\r\n          personal application save the solemn obligation of the whole\r\n          august body to accede to my timid proposal simultaneously\r\n          and by acclamation. Fortunately for us there are women in\r\n          Louisiana more sacrificing of their naturally shrinking\r\n          disposition, who perhaps take the cause more seriously than\r\n          your correspondent, who would make a most persuasive\r\n          enrolling-officer but not so gallant a general for active\r\n          service.\r\n\r\n     After securing over 400 influential names[517] the petition was\r\n     sent in to the convention and was referred to the Committee on\r\n     Suffrage, Mr. Felix P. Poche, chairman, now judge of the Supreme\r\n     Court. On May 7, the committee invited the ladies to a conference\r\n     at Parlor P, St. Charles Hotel. Mr. and Mrs. Saxon, Colonel and\r\n     Mrs. John M. Sandige and Mrs. Mollie Moore Davis were present.\r\n     Mrs. Saxon spoke for an hour and replied to questions from the\r\n     committee. She made a very favorable impression and was highly\r\n     commended for her argument. On June 16 the friends of the\r\n     petition were notified that a hearing would be granted them at\r\n     the evening session of the convention. Mrs. Harriette C. Keating\r\n     and Mrs. Elizabeth L. Saxon had consented to speak if such a\r\n     hearing were granted.\r\n\r\n     Col. John M. Sandige, who had occupied prominent positions in the\r\n     political affairs of the State, gave much encouragement and\r\n     assistance. He did not hesitate to urge the importance of this\r\n     movement, and the necessity that the women who were most\r\n     interested should cheerfully assume their responsibility in\r\n     relation to it. While Mrs. Saxon was known already as a fearless\r\n     and able reformer, and Dr. Harriette C. Keating as a noble\r\n     representative of woman in professional life, he thought it was\r\n     desirable to have a voice from the home and from society, and\r\n     Mrs. Caroline E. Merrick was solicited to come forward and\r\n     endorse what her colleagues would say, in a few words at the\r\n     close of the proceedings. Mrs. Merrick finally agreed that she\r\n     should see her duty in the light in which it was presented if\r\n     Judge Merrick, who constituted her court of last resort, should\r\n     leave her entirely free to act in the case. After a consultation,\r\n     to her great surprise and consternation the judge said, \"You have\r\n     always desired to help women--here is an opportunity; go forward\r\n     and do your share in this work.\"\r\n\r\n     The surprise could hardly have been greater if a procession of\r\n     slaves twenty-five years ago had come up in force to the lordly\r\n     mansion of their master with several spokesmen chosen from their\r\n     ranks, for the avowed purpose of asking for their freedom. The\r\n     ladies were treated with a delicate courtesy and kindness on this\r\n     unusual occasion, which they can never forget. Judge Poche, with\r\n     the tact of a true gentleman, endeavored to smooth a difficult\r\n     way, reassuring the failing courage of the ladies while assisting\r\n     them to mount the platform. The _Daily Picayune_ of June 17,\r\n     1879, said:\r\n\r\n          The usually prosaic and unimpressive appearance of the\r\n          convention hall assumed for the occasion an entire change\r\n          last evening. When the convention closed its forenoon's\r\n          labors, it took a recess until half-past 7 o'clock for the\r\n          purpose of affording the female suffragists an opportunity\r\n          to plead their cause before a full meeting. The scene before\r\n          the convention was called to order was interesting and\r\n          amusing. As the minutes rolled on the crowd of ladies\r\n          commenced to pour in, and by 8 o'clock the hall contained\r\n          some fifty representatives of the gentler sex of the\r\n          Crescent City. Every age of womanhood and every class of\r\n          beauty found a representative upon the floor. About half a\r\n          dozen \"society girls\" occupied a retired corner of the room,\r\n          while a number of the notables, including Mrs. Myra Clark\r\n          Gaines, took possession of the middle of the hall.\r\n\r\n          Promptly at 8 o'clock President Wiltz climbed to his seat\r\n          and called the convention to order in a tone slightly husky\r\n          from nervous excitement. Secretary Harris, having summoned\r\n          up his spare courage, called the roll in a determined voice.\r\n          Of the 134 members 106 responded to their names. After the\r\n          usual preliminaries Mr. Poche announced that a committee of\r\n          ladies were in attendance, prepared to address the\r\n          convention upon the question of woman suffrage. He then\r\n          introduced Mrs. Dr. Keating. The fair speaker had scarcely\r\n          begun before it was seen that she possessed a clear, slow\r\n          enunciation and perfect confidence in her ability to enforce\r\n          the doctrines of the cause she was to advocate. She read\r\n          from manuscript and showed no little knowledge of the rules\r\n          of oratory.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Saxon was greeted with a burst of applause, which was\r\n          gracefully acknowledged by the recipient; her address was\r\n          earnest and made a deep impression.\r\n\r\n          Mr. Robertson of St. Landry then offered the following\r\n          resolution, which lies over under the rules:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That the committee on elective franchises be\r\n          directed to embody in the article upon suffrage reported in\r\n          this convention, a provision giving the right of suffrage to\r\n          women upon the same terms as to men.\r\n\r\n          After some talk the resolution was laid aside to allow\r\n          another speech to be made. Mrs. E. T. Merrick was introduced\r\n          by Mr. Poche, as the wife of ex-Chief-Justice Merrick, and a\r\n          shower of applause followed the appearance of the lady. She\r\n          said:\r\n\r\n          _Mr. President and Delegates of the Convention:_--We have\r\n          met with such unexpected kindness in the reception which you\r\n          have accorded us to-night, that we find it hard to give\r\n          expression to anything but thanks. When we remember the\r\n          persistent and aggressive efforts which our energetic\r\n          sisters of the North put forth before they could obtain a\r\n          hearing before any legislative assembly, we find ourselves\r\n          lost in a pleasing astonishment at the graciousness which\r\n          beams upon us here from all quarters. Should we even now be\r\n          remanded to our places and have our petitions met with an\r\n          utter refusal, we should be grieved to the heart, we should\r\n          be sorely disappointed, but we never could cherish the least\r\n          feeling of rebellious spite toward this convention of men,\r\n          who have shown themselves so respectful and considerate\r\n          toward the women of Louisiana.\r\n\r\n          Perhaps some of the gentlemen thought we did not possess the\r\n          moral courage to venture even thus far from the retirement\r\n          in which we prefer to dwell; perhaps they thought we would\r\n          not dare to appear in person before this formidable body and\r\n          speak for our own cause. Be assured that a resolute and\r\n          conscientious woman can put aside her individual preferences\r\n          at the call of duty, and act unselfishly for the good of\r\n          others. You are our witnesses that we have not wearied you\r\n          by our importunities, nor have we sought in any disingenuous\r\n          manner to influence you in our favor. We are simply here in\r\n          response to your own courteous invitation to explain our\r\n          ideas and opinions on the great question of woman's\r\n          enfranchisement. The ladies who have already addressed you\r\n          have given you our arguments, and in eloquent language have\r\n          made their appeal, to which you could not have been\r\n          insensible. It only remains for me to give you some of my\r\n          own individual views in the few words which are to conclude\r\n          this interview.\r\n\r\n          We assure you we are not cherishing any ambitious ideas of\r\n          political honors and emoluments for women. We do not wish to\r\n          become governors or legislators, nor have we any inordinate\r\n          desire to obtain seats in congress. I have seen but one\r\n          woman who ever expressed even a wish to be president of\r\n          these United States. But we do ask with most serious\r\n          earnestness that you should give us the ballot, which has\r\n          been truly called the expression of allegiance and\r\n          responsibility to the government. All over the world this\r\n          same movement is advancing. In many countries earnest,\r\n          thoughtful, large-hearted women are working day and night to\r\n          elevate their sex; to secure higher education; to open new\r\n          avenues for their industrious hands; trying to make women\r\n          helpers to man, instead of being millstones round his neck\r\n          to sink him in his life struggle. Ah, if we could only\r\n          infuse into your souls the courage which we,\r\n          constitutionally timid as we are, now feel on this subject,\r\n          you would hasten to perform this act of justice, and\r\n          inaugurate the beginning of the end which all but the blind\r\n          can see is surely and steadily approaching. We are willing\r\n          to accept anything. We have always been in the position of\r\n          beggars, as now, and cannot be choosers if we wished. We\r\n          will gladly accept the franchise on any terms, provided they\r\n          be wholly and entirely honorable. If you should see proper\r\n          to subject us to an educational test, even of a high order,\r\n          we should try to attain it; if you require a considerable\r\n          property qualification, we would not complain. We would be\r\n          only too grateful for any amelioration of our legal\r\n          disabilities. Allow me to ask, are we less prepared for the\r\n          intelligent exercise of the right of suffrage than were the\r\n          freedmen when it was suddenly conferred upon them? Has not\r\n          this right been to them a beneficial stimulant, inducing\r\n          them to use exertions to promote their improvement, and has\r\n          it not raised them to a superior place, above the\r\n          disfranchised classes, such as the Chinese, Indians and\r\n          women?\r\n\r\n          Perhaps you think only a few of us desire the ballot. If\r\n          that were so, we think it would not be any sufficient reason\r\n          for withholding it. In old times most of our slaves were\r\n          happy and contented. Under the rule of good and humane\r\n          masters, they gave themselves no trouble to grasp after a\r\n          freedom which was beyond their reach. So it is with us\r\n          to-day. We are happy and kindly treated (as witness our\r\n          reception here to-night), and in the enjoyment of the\r\n          numerous privileges which our chivalrous gentlemen are so\r\n          ready to accord; many of us who feel a wish for freedom, do\r\n          not venture even to whisper a single word about our rights.\r\n          For the last twenty-five years I have occasionally expressed\r\n          a desire to vote, and it was always received as a matter of\r\n          surprise, but the sort of effect produced was as different\r\n          as the characters of the individuals with whom I conversed.\r\n          * * * *\r\n\r\n          Gentlemen of the convention, we now leave our cause in your\r\n          hands, and commend it to your favorable consideration. We\r\n          have pointed out to you the signs of the dawning of a\r\n          better day for woman, which are so plain before our eyes,\r\n          and implore you to reach out your hand and help us up, that\r\n          we may catch the first glimpse of its glory before it floods\r\n          the world with noon-day light.[518]\r\n\r\n          Col. John M. Sandidge read a letter from Mrs. Sarah A.\r\n          Dorsey:\r\n\r\n                                                  JUNE 11, 1879.\r\n\r\n          _Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Convention:_--Too weak\r\n          from recent illness and suffering to appear personally\r\n          before you by the side of the women of Louisiana who are\r\n          asking for the privilege and responsibility of political\r\n          suffrage, I am forced to use this mode of indorsing their\r\n          movement.\r\n\r\n          Being left by the fiat of God entirely alone in the world,\r\n          with no man to represent me, having large interests in the\r\n          State and no voice either in representation or taxation\r\n          while hundreds of my negro lessees vote and control my life\r\n          and property, I feel that I ought to say one word that may\r\n          perhaps aid many other women whom fate has left equally\r\n          destitute. It is doubtful whether I shall rise from my couch\r\n          of pain to profit by the gift should the men of Louisiana\r\n          decide to give the women of the State the right which is the\r\n          heritage of the Anglo-Saxon race--representation for\r\n          taxation. But still I ask it for my sisters and for the\r\n          future of the race. We women of Louisiana have always been\r\n          treated before the law as civil partners of our husbands. In\r\n          every respect our rights have been protected.\r\n\r\n          It needs but one more step to make us civilly free, and this\r\n          we ask you to embody in your new constitution. Many men are\r\n          not opposed to the fact of female suffrage, but to its mode\r\n          at present; that could be corrected, and women need not be\r\n          exposed to the coarseness and strife of the polls as they\r\n          are now conducted. There is no man among you who does not\r\n          believe his wife or his daughter intelligently capable of\r\n          taking a voice in the government. If my lessees are capable\r\n          of being citizens of Louisiana, it is because for thirty\r\n          years of my life and for five generations of my ancestors we\r\n          have interested ourselves in their civilization and in their\r\n          instruction. Gentlemen, we ask nothing that would unsex\r\n          ourselves. We do not expect to do man's work; we can never\r\n          pass the limits which nature herself has set. But we ask for\r\n          justice; we ask for removal of unnatural restrictions that\r\n          are contrary to the elemental spirit of the civil law; we do\r\n          not ask for rights, but for permission to assume our natural\r\n          responsibilities.\r\n\r\n          Praying that the hearts and minds of the men of Louisiana\r\n          may be moved toward this act of justice, I am, with profound\r\n          respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                             SARAH A. DORSEY.\r\n\r\n     The Webster _Tribune_, Mr. Scanland, editor, of June 25, 1879,\r\n     shows the sensation created in the remotest parishes of Louisiana\r\n     by this hearing before the convention:\r\n\r\n          The ladies, it seems, are about walking up and demanding\r\n          enlarged liberties. We were under the impression that women\r\n          generally had about as much latitude as they wanted, but if\r\n          they desire more, the _Tribune_ says, in the name of\r\n          gallantry if not justice, let them have all they wish. There\r\n          is an element throughout the Union agitating the proposition\r\n          that they are entitled to vote because they are taxed. The\r\n          Constitution of the United States provides that no one shall\r\n          be taxed without representation. Representation is based on\r\n          population, and, of course, the ladies are enumerated; and\r\n          the \"horrid men\" claim that the ladies are represented\r\n          through them. This a great many repudiate, and their heads\r\n          are about level. When a man assumes to represent a woman, he\r\n          undertakes a larger contract than he imagines--something we\r\n          would not dream of attempting in a political or any other\r\n          sense.\r\n\r\n          The ladies who advocate female suffrage claim that as they\r\n          are governed by the laws they have a right to a voice in\r\n          making them. Many of the ablest women of this country hold\r\n          that belief, and of all our noble statesmen, not one has\r\n          advanced an answer to this demand--reasonable, if it does\r\n          come from women. A French essayist held that as women are a\r\n          part of society, they have a right to be judges of its\r\n          members, assist in making its laws, and condemn and punish\r\n          transgressors. They have their influence, but that is not so\r\n          effective as power. * * * * Some of the brightest intellects\r\n          that adorn the social circles throughout this country and\r\n          State hold these views and ably advance them. Among them in\r\n          this State are Mrs. E. L. Saxon, Mrs. Merrick, wife of\r\n          ex-Chief-Justice Merrick, and Mrs. Dr. Harriette Keating.\r\n          When our convention was discussing the suffrage question,\r\n          these ladies petitioned to be heard. Of course the request\r\n          was allowed. Last Tuesday evening the above-mentioned ladies\r\n          addressed the congress at length. Their speeches were able,\r\n          and the ideas they advanced were sound logic; but if carried\r\n          into effect may prove beneficial, and may not. Woman\r\n          suffrage is an experiment. Like everything else, we will\r\n          never know its effects until after it is tried. We only wish\r\n          that there were a few more men in that convention who could\r\n          make as able speeches as did these ladies--notwithstanding\r\n          the Utopian ideas advanced.\r\n\r\n     When the new constitution finally went forth, it contained, as\r\n     the result of all our arguments and appeals, but one little\r\n     concession:\r\n\r\n          ARTICLE 232. Women twenty-one years of age and upwards,\r\n          shall be eligible to any office of control or management\r\n          under the school laws of the State.\r\n\r\n     Judge I. F. Marshall of Catahoula parish, an accomplished\r\n     gentleman and able lawyer, suggested this article, and it was\r\n     presented and championed by Hon. F. L. Claiborne[519] of Pointe\r\n     Coupee. The women of Louisiana have never realized any advantage\r\n     from this law. All school offices are filled by appointment of\r\n     the governor, and there was no serious agitation for the\r\n     enforcement of this clause in the new constitution until the\r\n     autumn of 1885, when, in response to the demand that women should\r\n     be appointed on the school-board of New Orleans, Gov. McEnery,\r\n     through a correspondent of the _Times-Democrat_, gave his opinion\r\n     as follows:\r\n\r\n          If a married woman occupied an office under the school laws,\r\n          in which it was necessary to bring a suit to enforce some\r\n          right connected with it, she would have to get the consent\r\n          of her husband to bring the suit and join him with her.\r\n          There are only a few exceptional cases where the married\r\n          woman can legally act independently of her husband. Our code\r\n          so recognizes the paramount control of the husband that when\r\n          a widow, who is the tutor of her minor children, wishes to\r\n          marry, and gets the consent of a family meeting to be\r\n          retained in the tutorship, the code, article 255, says: Her\r\n          second husband becomes of necessity the co-tutor, and, for\r\n          the administration of the property subsequently to his\r\n          marriage, becomes bound _in solido_ with his wife. And so it\r\n          would be in the appointment of a married woman to a public\r\n          office. Her husband, of necessity, would share it with her;\r\n          would, in fact, be the officer. And as to unmarried women,\r\n          Article 232 does not repeal any of their disabilities. It\r\n          does not repeal the laws creating the essential differences\r\n          between men and women. It, as I stated, simply asserts a\r\n          right, and is inoperative until there is legislation to\r\n          enforce it.\r\n\r\n     The _Daily Picayune_ of November 16, under the head lines of\r\n     \"Women as Members of School Boards,\" \"The Law and the Facts in\r\n     the Case Presented by Mrs. Merrick,\" gives the following:\r\n\r\n          Last Thursday evening, November 12, a special meeting or\r\n          reception was held by the women's club at their rooms on\r\n          Baronne street. On this occasion the club was addressed by\r\n          Mrs. Caroline E. Merrick, a good and practical-minded friend\r\n          of the cause of woman. The 12th was the seventieth birthday\r\n          of Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and a decorated picture of\r\n          the famous woman hung in the rooms. Mrs. Merrick read a\r\n          sketch of the life of Mrs. Stanton, but devoted the first\r\n          part of the evening to reading the following paper, the\r\n          matter of which is, of the keenest interest to all thinking\r\n          men and women in the State:\r\n\r\n          More than eighty thousand children attend the public schools\r\n          in Louisiana, and of this number one-half are girls, and of\r\n          the 389 teachers employed in the public schools of New\r\n          Orleans, 368 are women. It cannot be denied that these are\r\n          of equal concern and importance to the State with any like\r\n          number of boys and men, nor does it require any argument to\r\n          prove that mothers are best qualified to superintend and\r\n          look after the welfare of their own children. In view of\r\n          this fact the convention of 1879 embodied the following\r\n          article in the constitution of the State:\r\n\r\n          ARTICLE 232. Women 21 years of age and upward shall be\r\n          eligible to any office of control or management under the\r\n          school laws of this State.\r\n\r\n          Notwithstanding the absolute right conferred by this article\r\n          on women over twenty-one years of age, the chief executive\r\n          of the State, with his present views, is apparently\r\n          unwilling to make any appointment of women to such\r\n          management without further legislation. The views of the\r\n          Governor on all questions are always entitled to great\r\n          respect. The question is one of interpretation, and many of\r\n          the best lawyers in Louisiana do not hesitate to hold and\r\n          declare a different view.\r\n\r\n          I am told that there are in the various constitutions of the\r\n          States and general government two classes of provisions, the\r\n          one self-executing and absolute, and the other requiring\r\n          legislative action before they can be exercised. For example\r\n          of the first class, article 59 of the constitution declares\r\n          that \"the supreme executive power of the State shall be\r\n          vested in a chief magistrate, who shall be styled the\r\n          Governor of Louisiana.\" Nobody would ever undertake to say\r\n          that the governor was dependent on any more legislation to\r\n          carry this into effect so as to enable him to fill his\r\n          office. If he were, it would then become necessary to\r\n          legislate about every other article, and so the constitution\r\n          would be worthless, everything being required to be done\r\n          over by the legislature before the constitution could have\r\n          any effect.\r\n\r\n          Article 232 of the constitution is imperative. It declares\r\n          that women over twenty-one years of age shall be eligible to\r\n          any office of control or management under the school laws of\r\n          the State. Can the legislature repeal or modify this\r\n          mandate? Of course not. Could the absoluteness of this right\r\n          be expressed in plainer or more energetic terms? No, indeed.\r\n          We are told and have been made to understand that it is a\r\n          right conferred by the constitution of the State, which\r\n          cannot be defeated or enlarged, or even abridged in any way\r\n          by the legislature; neither by modification, repeal, or\r\n          inaction. That this article being paramount law, itself\r\n          repeals all legislation inconsistent with it. The\r\n          constitution, I am told, prescribes the legal and other\r\n          qualifications for our judges of the courts. Nobody ever\r\n          thought legislative action was needed when their\r\n          qualifications are according to that instrument, to enable\r\n          them to take their places on the bench.\r\n\r\n          Article 185 of the constitution prescribes the\r\n          qualifications of voters or electors, and we are instructed\r\n          that all conflicting laws on that point are annulled by the\r\n          sovereign will of the people in convention assembled. In\r\n          fact, good lawyers have given us innumerable examples,\r\n          illustrations and decisions to this effect; and even women,\r\n          who are for the most part ignorant of the laws of their\r\n          State, begin to understand that they have a right to a place\r\n          on the school-board for some one of their own sex here in\r\n          Louisiana. True, it has been said that there are other\r\n          articles which are in conflict with article 232, but we are\r\n          told the other provisions of the constitution relate to\r\n          other and more general subjects, and on this very subject\r\n          the framers of the constitution have in very positive and\r\n          unmistakable terms declared its precise will, and it is\r\n          wasting time to try to explain it away. These wise jurists\r\n          do not fear to tell us further, that special laws or\r\n          provisions in a constitution or statute abrogate or limit\r\n          the general provisions in the same instrument.\r\n\r\n          We are sorry that our governor apprehends any difficulty\r\n          would arise in regard to married women being school\r\n          directors. He says the husband might change his domicile and\r\n          the wife would be obliged to follow him, and if bond were\r\n          required she could not sign it without his consent, and\r\n          finally the fact was she could not do _anything_ without the\r\n          husband's consent. Then \"the husband would share the office\r\n          with her.\" I have heard that it was difficult to prevent\r\n          outside influences from operating upon the minds of men in\r\n          office. We have certainly heard some complaints of this\r\n          sort, but it seems that there would be no great danger\r\n          encountered from this source. The duties which this article\r\n          of the constitution permits women to perform are not\r\n          generally remunerative, and would be probably more a labor\r\n          of love than of reward. As to the other objections, perhaps\r\n          the husband _would_ sign his wife's bond, and perhaps he\r\n          would _not_ move away while she held the office. I have\r\n          heard that sheriffs sometimes run away after giving bond,\r\n          and people are sometimes elected to office and unable to\r\n          qualify, and others disappoint the public by resigning.\r\n          Moreover we have ascertained the fact that a tutrix may\r\n          subsequently marry, and that act does not prevent her from\r\n          filling the office of tutrix, neither does the fact of being\r\n          already married prevent her from discharging the duties of\r\n          tutrix. But I see no harm done if the husband should become\r\n          the assistant of his wife in this office. Is it not manifest\r\n          that the two together would have a superior official\r\n          knowledge of the needs and exigencies of the girls sent to\r\n          the public schools and the women who teach them daily, than\r\n          the husband could possibly attain by himself? But the whole\r\n          difficulty, it seems to us, might be obviated. Let the\r\n          governor appoint unmarried women. A woman who has been so\r\n          unfortunate as to be a widow would not be objectionable.\r\n\r\n          The article says: \"Women over twenty-one years shall be\r\n          eligible\" to these offices. It does not say the legislature\r\n          may make them \"eligible.\" By its own inherent force it\r\n          declares them eligible. If they are really eligible, then\r\n          why not have them selected and appointed? They have every\r\n          requisite for the office, and as the dictionary says, are\r\n          \"proper to be chosen.\" They are \"qualified to be elected.\"\r\n          They are \"legally qualified.\" They are eligible. It is not\r\n          at all likely that the legislature will ever do the vain\r\n          thing of affirming a constitutional right so explicitly\r\n          given.\r\n\r\n          The opposition of the executive, therefore, seems to be a\r\n          bar not only to this provision being carried out, but also\r\n          to the raising of any question under it for the\r\n          consideration of the judiciary. It is confidently hoped and\r\n          expected that he will consent to reconsider the whole\r\n          question. We feel sure the governor will not intentionally\r\n          be guilty of any injustice to the women of Louisiana, and\r\n          will not desire to withhold any benefit from them which has\r\n          already been conferred by the State constitution. Women all\r\n          over the Union rejoiced when this generous concession was\r\n          granted here in Louisiana. In many other States they enjoy\r\n          the same, and greater privileges, and letters and inquiries\r\n          have come from distant States, asking why this law has not\r\n          gone into effect. We are aware that any reform changing\r\n          existing conditions must move slowly, and is apt to be\r\n          unpopular with men in authority; then it also antagonizes\r\n          the inertia of women, who are too modest to thrust\r\n          themselves forward, saying, \"I am ready to serve the State\";\r\n          yet they know all the time they can do good service in\r\n          relation to the schools. Only give them a kindly helping\r\n          hand, and we feel sure that a valuable cooeperating influence\r\n          will be felt, of which no one has ever dreamed in the past.\r\n          We leave this matter to the governor, to the citizens of\r\n          Louisiana, and to the fathers who take a deep interest in\r\n          the welfare of their daughters as well as of their sons.\r\n\r\n     Our legislature passed a law requiring physiology to be taught in\r\n     the public schools, while the vast majority of the teachers of\r\n     the State are women, and no college in which that science is\r\n     taught is open to them. In 1885, Dr. Chaille gave a course of\r\n     free lectures on physiology and anatomy for the benefit of the\r\n     New Orleans teachers, who, while they are doing the most\r\n     important-public work in training the rising generation in the\r\n     rudiments of learning, are denied the advantages of the higher\r\n     education that would fit them for the duties of their profession.\r\n     A fitting precedent for the action of our rulers may be found in\r\n     Shakespeare's, \"Titus Andronicus,\" in which rude men seize the\r\n     king's daughter, cut out her tongue and cut off her hands, and\r\n     then bid her go call for water and wash her hands.\r\n\r\n     The State Pharmaceutical Association, formed in 1882 with 110\r\n     members, unanimously elected Miss Eliza Rudolph a member. Miss\r\n     Rudolph was then the only woman in the drug business. Having been\r\n     refused admission to the medical college of the State University,\r\n     she perfected herself in pharmacy by a course of private\r\n     lectures. In 1884 she was elected corresponding secretary of the\r\n     association.\r\n\r\n     The _Daily Picayune_, in closing its half-century, gives the\r\n     following of Mrs. E. J. Nicholson, its chief owner and manager\r\n     since January, 1876:\r\n\r\n          \"Pearl Rivers,\" the lady's _nom de plume_, was already well\r\n          known in the republic of letters before she became, as she\r\n          now is, the most eminent female journalist in the world,\r\n          largely owning and successfully directing for years a great\r\n          daily political journal. The fact is unique. The fame of\r\n          Mrs. Nicholson belongs to the world of letters and her\r\n          biography may be found in any dictionary of Southern\r\n          authors, nevertheless a history of the _Picayune_ would not\r\n          be complete without some notice of one who has had so much\r\n          to do with its destiny. Miss Eliza J. Poltevent is a native\r\n          of Hancock county, Mississippi. She was born on the banks of\r\n          one of the most beautiful streams in the South, Pearl river.\r\n          She wrote over the name of \"Pearl Rivers,\" and her poems\r\n          made her a conspicuous niche in the temple of Southern\r\n          letters. She wrote much for the _Picayune_ and wrote herself\r\n          into love as well as fame. She was married to Col. Holbrook,\r\n          the proprietor of the paper, and after his death in 1876,\r\n          she succeeded to the ownership. This was a trying position\r\n          for a woman. The South had not recovered from the\r\n          devastation of the war, and the _Picayune_ was involved in\r\n          embarrassments. Friends even advised her to dispose of the\r\n          property and not to undertake so formidable a task as the\r\n          conduct of a daily paper under existing complications. Brave\r\n          and true-hearted, with a profound and abiding conviction of\r\n          her duty in the matter, she assumed the control of the\r\n          paper. She wisely surrounded herself with able and devoted\r\n          assistants, and with their help has gallantly and\r\n          successfully surmounted many formidable obstacles, until she\r\n          has seen the _Picayune_ reestablished on a sound and\r\n          prosperous basis. Mr. George Nicholson had acquired a\r\n          proprietorship in it, and when Mrs. Holbrook assumed control\r\n          the firm name was E. J. Holbrook & Co. On June 28, 1878, the\r\n          interests of the two copartners were further consolidated by\r\n          marriage. Since then the _Picayune_ has been published under\r\n          the firm name of Nicholson & Co., and the columns daily\r\n          attest the energy, enterprise and ability with which it is\r\n          conducted, while its advertising patronage speaks for\r\n          itself.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Martha R. Field is a member of the editorial staff of the\r\n     _Picayune_. She has charge of the Sunday woman's column, besides\r\n     her regular column over the _nom de plume_ of Catherine Cole.\r\n\r\n     The _Times-Democrat_ is owned by Mrs. Burke, who however leaves\r\n     its management to her husband, Col. Burke. Miss Bessie Bisland,\r\n     under the name of B. L. R. Dane, contributes to the Sunday paper,\r\n     and edits the \"_Bric-a-Brac_ column\" which consists of criticisms\r\n     and reviews of the leading magazines. This paper boasts the most\r\n     clever \"Society column\" in the country; it is edited by Mrs.\r\n     Jennie Coldwell Nixon who is now, 1886, superintendent of the\r\n     Woman's Department of the Exposition.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. J. Pinkney Smith edits the \"Social Melange\" of the _States_.\r\n     Among the regular Sunday contributors are Miss Corrinne\r\n     Castillanos, who buzzes as the Society Bee, and Mrs. Mollie Moore\r\n     Davis, known as the \"Texas Song Bird.\" Mrs. Ada Hilderbrand,\r\n     editor of the _Courier_ at Gretna, did the printing for the\r\n     Woman's Exposition.\r\n\r\n     New Orleans has a Woman's National Press Association of which\r\n     Mrs. E. J. Nicholson is president; a Christian Woman's Exchange,\r\n     Mrs. R. M. Wamsley, president, doing a business of $45,000 a\r\n     year,[520] a Southern Art Union and Woman's Industrial\r\n     Association, with Mrs. J. H. Stauffer and others on the auxiliary\r\n     executive committee, and a Woman's Club,[521] originated by Miss\r\n     Bessie Bisland who was the president of the club for the first\r\n     year, 1885.\r\n\r\n     The laws of Louisiana relating to women have been given by Judge\r\n     E. T. Merrick, a well-known legal authority and for ten years the\r\n     chief-justice of the Supreme Court of the State:\r\n\r\n          The rights of married women to their estates are probably\r\n          better secured in Louisiana than in any other of these\r\n          United States. The laws on this subject are derived from\r\n          Spain. Certain provinces of that kingdom were conquered and\r\n          for centuries held by the Visigoths, among whom, as among\r\n          the Franks at Paris, the institution called the community of\r\n          aquets and gains between husband and wife, prevailed. In\r\n          Spain, as in France, there were certain provinces in which\r\n          the ancient Roman law continued in force, and they were\r\n          called the provinces of the written law. In these (called\r\n          also the countries of the _dotal regime_) there was no\r\n          community between the spouses of their acquisitions. Both of\r\n          these systems are recognized by the Louisiana civil code,\r\n          but if the parties marry without any marriage settlement the\r\n          law implies that they have married under the _regime_ of the\r\n          community. To prevent error it is proper to observe that\r\n          there have been three civil codes adopted in Louisiana,\r\n          viz., in 1808, 1825 and 1870. The marriage laws are\r\n          substantially the same in all, but bear different numbers in\r\n          each code. The following references are to the code of 1870.\r\n          Except in a very limited number of cases the husband and\r\n          wife are incapable of making binding contracts with each\r\n          other during the marriage. Hence all settlements of\r\n          property, to be binding, must be executed before marriage\r\n          and in solemn form, that is, before a notary and two male\r\n          witnesses having the proper qualifications. The betrothed\r\n          are granted considerable liberty over the provisions of\r\n          their marriage contract, as the following quotations show:\r\n\r\n          ART. 2,325. In relation to property, the law only regulates\r\n          the conjugal association in default of particular\r\n          agreements, which the parties are at liberty to stipulate as\r\n          they please, provided they be not contrary to good morals\r\n          and under the modifications hereafter prescribed.\r\n\r\n          ART. 2,326. Husband and wife can in no case enter into any\r\n          agreement or make any renunciation the object of which would\r\n          be to alter the legal order of descents, either with respect\r\n          to themselves, in what concerns the inheritance of their\r\n          children, posterity, or with respect to their children\r\n          between themselves, without prejudice to the donations\r\n          _inter vivas_ or _mortis causa_, which may take place\r\n          according to the formalities and in the cases determined by\r\n          this code.\r\n\r\n          The parties are also \"prohibited from derogating from the\r\n          power of the husband over the person of his wife and\r\n          children which belongs to the husband as the head of the\r\n          family, or from the rights guaranteed to the surviving\r\n          husband or wife\" (C. C., Art. 2,327).\r\n\r\n          If the parties adopt the _dotal regime_ in their marriage\r\n          contract the dotal effects are (except under some\r\n          circumstances) inalienable during marriage; and at the\r\n          dissolution of the marriage, they are to be replaced or\r\n          returned to the wife, or her heirs, and to secure this, the\r\n          wife has a mortgage on her husband's lands, and a privilege\r\n          on his movables, including those of the community (C. C.,\r\n          Art. 2376; Art. 2347). \"The dower is given to the husband,\r\n          for him to enjoy the same as long as the marriage shall\r\n          last.\" Strong as is this language, the dowry is given by the\r\n          wife or her father or mother or other relations or friends,\r\n          simply to support the marriage.\r\n\r\n          Under the _regime_ of the community, the individual property\r\n          of the husband or wife, and all property either may acquire\r\n          afterwards by inheritance or donations re-remain separate\r\n          property. The conjugal partnership is defined by C. C., Art.\r\n          2402. \"This partnership, or community, consists of the\r\n          profits of all the effects of which the husband has the\r\n          administration and enjoyment, either of right or in fact, of\r\n          the produce of the reciprocal industry and labor of both\r\n          husband and wife, and the estates which they may acquire\r\n          during marriage, either by donations made jointly to them\r\n          both, or by purchase, or in any other similar way, even\r\n          should the purchase be in the name of one of the two, and\r\n          not of both, because in that case the period of time when\r\n          the purchase is made is alone attended to, and not the\r\n          person who made the purchase.\"\r\n\r\n          During the marriage the husband has the management of the\r\n          community, and he can sell or exchange the same, but he\r\n          cannot give away the real estate without binding his estate\r\n          to recompense the wife or her heirs, for the one-half so\r\n          given away. All the income of his estate must enter into the\r\n          community. On the other hand the wife may at her pleasure\r\n          take her own estate from the management of the husband into\r\n          her own control and discretion (C. C. 2384). But in this\r\n          contingency she must contribute to the family expenses (C.\r\n          C. 2389 and 2435).\r\n\r\n          If the affairs of the husband become embarrassed, the wife\r\n          can sue the husband for a separation of property, and get a\r\n          judgment against him for all indebtedness, on account of\r\n          money or property used or disposed of by him, and sell him\r\n          out under execution, and buy in the property herself if she\r\n          sees fit. Thus she stands in a more favorable position\r\n          toward the community than the husband, who is bound for all\r\n          its debts, for she can stand by and choose. If the community\r\n          becomes prosperous, she has the absolute right, as owner, to\r\n          one-half of it after payment of debts, and a right to the\r\n          income of the other half until she dies, or marries a second\r\n          time.\r\n\r\n          By causing her claims on account of her separate or\r\n          paraphernal estate to be recorded, she secures a mortgage\r\n          against her husband's lands and the lands of the community.\r\n          If a husband or wife dies affluent, leaving the survivor in\r\n          necessitous circumstances, the latter can claim one-fourth\r\n          of the estate of the deceased. This is called \"the marital\r\n          fourth.\" The wife, also, if she or the children do not\r\n          possess one thousand dollars in their own right, can claim\r\n          as a privilege and against the creditors, one thousand\r\n          dollars, or a sum which, with her own estate, shall equal\r\n          that amount.\r\n\r\n          The wife cannot appear in court, or dispose of, or mortgage,\r\n          or acquire real estate, without the consent of the husband,\r\n          but the judge of the court of the domicil may authorize the\r\n          wife to sue, or be sued. If the husband refuses to empower\r\n          the wife to contract, she may cite him into court and have\r\n          the property of the proposed contract settled by an order of\r\n          the judge. The wife has full power to make a will without\r\n          any authorization from her husband or the court.\r\n\r\n          ART. 2,398. The wife, whether separated in property, by\r\n          contract, or by judgment, or not separated, cannot bind\r\n          herself for her husband, nor conjointly with him, for debts\r\n          contracted by him before or during the marriage.\r\n\r\n          ART. 119. The husband and wife owe to each other mutual\r\n          fidelity, support and assistance.\r\n\r\n          ART. 120. The wife is bound to live with her husband, and\r\n          follow him wherever he chooses to reside; the husband is\r\n          obliged to receive her, and furnish her with whatever is\r\n          required for the convenience of life in proportion to his\r\n          means and condition.\r\n\r\n          It is provided that the domicil for granting divorces of\r\n          such marriages as have been solemnized in Louisiana, shall\r\n          be in that State so that the courts of Louisiana may grant\r\n          divorces for causes and faults committed in foreign\r\n          countries. For abandonment and other causes, a final divorce\r\n          cannot be granted until one year after a decree of\r\n          separation from bed and board has elapsed without a\r\n          reconciliation. In other particulars the law is similar to\r\n          that of the other States.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Caroline E. Merrick]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day in 1842, the New Orleans _Delta_ had this item: \"Myra Clark\r\nGaines argued her own case in court in this city; the only instance\r\nof a lady appearing as counsel in the courts.\" Mrs. Gaines was a\r\nremarkable woman. She carried on a suit for many years against the\r\ncity of New Orleans to recover property that belonged to her, and,\r\nthrough untold difficulties and delays, triumphed at last. She\r\npreserved her youth, beauty and vivacity until late in life. All\r\nwho knew her can readily recall her bright, sparkling face, and\r\nwonderful powers of conversation. In her long experience in\r\nlitigation, she became well versed in the laws regarding real\r\nestate and the right of descent. Mrs. Gaines was a generous woman\r\nand did not desire to rob the poor; to many such she gave a\r\nquit-claim title to the property which she had secured under her\r\nsuits.\r\n\r\nIn 1869, the New Orleans _Republican_ had an excellent editorial\r\nfully endorsing the demand for woman's enfranchisement. In 1870 the\r\n_Livingston Herald_, published in Ponchatoula parish, by J. O. and\r\nJ. E. Spencer, advocated suffrage for women.\r\n\r\nIn 1874, the secretary of the treasury rendered a decision that\r\nwhen a woman owns a steamboat she may be named in the papers as the\r\nmaster of the same. This decision, despite the opposition of\r\nSolicitor Raynor, received confirmation in case of Mrs. Miller, in\r\n1883, from Secretary Charles J. Folger.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--TEXAS.\r\n\r\nIn the adoption of the first constitution of Texas, woman had some\r\nrepresentatives in the convention to remind the legislators of that\r\nState of her existence, and to demand that the constitution be so\r\nframed as to secure the right of suffrage alike to both sexes. On\r\nthe resolution of Mr. Mundine, to extend suffrage to women, in the\r\nconstitutional convention of Texas, January, 1869, Hon. L. D. Evans\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     I do not favor the adoption of this measure at the present time,\r\n     because the country is not yet prepared, yet it is entitled to\r\n     our respectful consideration--therefore I thank the convention\r\n     for allowing me the opportunity to state the ground on which the\r\n     friends of woman suffrage place their advocacy, so far as I may\r\n     be able under the five-minute rule. It does not comport with the\r\n     dignity of a representative body engaged in forming a\r\n     constitution of government to thrust aside the claim of woman to\r\n     the right of suffrage,--a claim that is advocated by some of the\r\n     ablest statesmen and political philosophers of Europe and\r\n     America, and is destined to a sure and speedy triumph.\r\n\r\n     Aristotle, the profoundest thinker of antiquity, in his treatise\r\n     on politics, defines a citizen to be \"one who enjoys a due share\r\n     in the government of that country of which he is a member.\" If he\r\n     does not enjoy this right, then he is no citizen, but a subject.\r\n     Every citizen, therefore, is entitled to a voice--a vote--a due\r\n     share in the government of his country. I am aware that the\r\n     courts and politicians in democratic America have not so defined\r\n     citizenship. The reason is that politics is not yet a positive\r\n     science, and they have failed to analyze this question. Had they\r\n     a clear conception of the constituent elements--the anatomy, so\r\n     to speak, of the body politic, they would perceive that\r\n     suffrage--a voice in the government--is an essential condition of\r\n     citizenship. Aristotle, in his treatise, which is perhaps the\r\n     ablest yet given to the world, pointed out that families, not\r\n     individuals, are the constituent units of a State.\r\n\r\n     A family--a household--exists and is held together by natural\r\n     laws, independent of the State, and an aggregation of these\r\n     constitute the State. The head of the family, whoever that may\r\n     be, according to its structure, is the representative in the\r\n     State. All the constituent members of the family, consisting, in\r\n     its most perfect form, of husband, wife, children and domestics,\r\n     are subject to the authority of the head, and have no voice, no\r\n     vote, no share in the government, except through their head or\r\n     representative. In societies where the common law obtains, which\r\n     in this respect is a transcript of the Bible, the wife, like the\r\n     child, is subordinated to the authority of the husband, and on\r\n     principle, has no voice, no vote. On the decease of the husband,\r\n     the widow becomes the head of the family, and on principle is\r\n     entitled to a voice, a vote. But in countries where the civil law\r\n     governs, the wife is the partner, and not the subject of her\r\n     husband, and on principle ought to have her due share in the\r\n     government.\r\n\r\n     When the children in a family, whether male or female, attain the\r\n     age fixed by law for the control of their own affairs, and do\r\n     control them, they are free, independent, and on every principle\r\n     are entitled to a due share in the government--to a vote. Every\r\n     member of society who is free and independent--capable of\r\n     managing his own affairs, or making his own living, and does make\r\n     it, should have the same right of choice in the selection of his\r\n     political agents that he has to select his legal or business\r\n     agents. But all persons, no matter from what cause, who are\r\n     unable to maintain themselves, and are dependent for their\r\n     support upon others, are incapable of any share in the\r\n     government, and should have no voice--no vote. As soon as the\r\n     principle of citizenship comes to be thoroughly understood, woman\r\n     suffrage must be adopted throughout the United States, in\r\n     England, and in every country where representative government\r\n     exists.\r\n\r\n_The Revolution_ of August 20, 1868, said:\r\n\r\n     We have received from Loring P. Haskins, esq., a delegate to the\r\n     convention, the following excellent report and declaration made\r\n     and signed by a majority of the committee to whom the subject of\r\n     woman suffrage was referred. We need scarcely bespeak attentive\r\n     reading:\r\n\r\n          _Report of the Committee on State Affairs upon Female\r\n          Suffrage, with accompanying Declaration:_\r\n\r\n          July 30, 1868--Introduced and ordered to be printed.\r\n\r\n                         COMMITTEE ROOM, AUSTIN, Texas, July 10, 1868.\r\n\r\n          _To the Hon. E. J. Davis, President of the Convention:_\r\n\r\n          A majority of your Committee on State Affairs, to whom was\r\n          referred the declaration introduced by the Hon. T. H.\r\n          Mundine of the county of Burleson, to extend the right of\r\n          suffrage to all citizens of the State over the age of\r\n          twenty-one years, possessing the requisite qualifications\r\n          for electors, have examined with much care said declaration\r\n          and considered the object sought to be accomplished, and\r\n          have arrived at the conclusion that said declaration ought\r\n          to be a part of the organic law.\r\n\r\n          It was said by George Washington that the safety of\r\n          republican government depends upon the virtue and\r\n          intelligence of the people. This declaration is not a new\r\n          theory of government for the first time proposed to be made\r\n          a part of our republican institutions. The idea of extending\r\n          the elective franchise to females has been discussed both in\r\n          Great Britain and in the United States. Your committee are\r\n          of the opinion that the true base of republican government\r\n          must ever be the wisdom and virtue of the people.\r\n\r\n          In this State our system of jurisprudence is a combination\r\n          of civil and Spanish law, intermixed with the common law of\r\n          England; and this peculiar system, just in all its parts for\r\n          the preservation of the rights of married and unmarried\r\n          women, is likely to be continued. The time was when woman\r\n          was regarded as the mere slave of man. It was believed, in\r\n          order to perpetuate the pretended divine right of kings to\r\n          rule, that the mass of the people should be kept in profound\r\n          ignorance and that woman was not entitled to the benefits of\r\n          learning at all. It is not remarkable that as the benign\r\n          principles of Christianity have been promulgated, free\r\n          government has steadily progressed and the divine rights of\r\n          woman have been recognized.\r\n\r\n          The old constitution of the republic of Texas, the\r\n          constitution of the State of Texas of 1845, the laws enacted\r\n          for the protection of married women, the many learned\r\n          decisions of the Supreme Courts of Texas and Louisiana, and\r\n          other courts, clearly indicate that the march of\r\n          intelligence is onward and that our advanced civilization\r\n          has approximated to the period when other and more sacred\r\n          rights are to be conceded. Is it just that woman, who bears\r\n          her reasonable portion of the burdens of government, should\r\n          be denied the right of aiding in the enactment of its laws?\r\n\r\n          The question of extending the freedom of the ballot to woman\r\n          may well claim the attention of the law-maker, and in view\r\n          of the importance of the subject a majority of your\r\n          committee earnestly recommend the passage of the\r\n          declaration.\r\n\r\n                                          H. C. HUNT, _Chairman_,\r\n\r\n                                   T. H. MUNDINE,    BENJ. WATROUS,\r\n                                   WM. H. FLEMING,    L. P. HARRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               A DECLARATION.\r\n\r\n          Be it declared by the people of Texas in convention\r\n          assembled, that the following shall be a section of the\r\n          constitution of the State of Texas, known as section ---- of\r\n          article ----: Every person, without distinction of sex, who\r\n          shall have arrived at the age of twenty-one years, and who\r\n          shall be a citizen of the United States, or is at the time\r\n          of the adoption of this constitution by the congress of the\r\n          United States a citizen of the State of Texas, and shall\r\n          have resided in this State one year next preceding an\r\n          election, and the last six months within the district,\r\n          county, city or town in which he or she offers to vote,\r\n          shall be an elector.\r\n\r\nThe _Woman's Journal_ of December 4, 1875, contains a letter from\r\nMrs. Sarah W. Hiatt, who presented a memorial to the constitutional\r\nconvention. The memorial was referred to the Committee on Suffrage.\r\nIn regard to the effect, she says:\r\n\r\n     Since the presentation of the memorial I have had some very\r\n     interesting letters on the subject from a few of our leading men;\r\n     some for, others against woman suffrage, but all treating the\r\n     subject respectfully. I copy below a portion of one just\r\n     received. I should like to give it entire with the writer's name,\r\n     but have not his permission to do so:\r\n\r\n          As you apprehended, the question of suffrage had been\r\n          definitely settled in the convention before the reception of\r\n          your letter. It remains as heretofore, unrestricted manhood\r\n          suffrage. That all the rabble, the very _debris_ of society,\r\n          should be allowed a voice in government, and yet\r\n          intelligent, highly-cultivated women who are amenable to the\r\n          laws of the State and who own and pay taxes on property,\r\n          should be debarred from a voice in making the laws which are\r\n          to affect their persons and property equally with that of\r\n          the men, is to my mind simply an outrage on reason and\r\n          justice. * * * The fear of ignoring the right of petition,\r\n          and gallantry towards your sex on the part of a few,\r\n          prevented the memorial from being summarily rejected.\r\n          Outside of ---- and ---- I know of no member of the\r\n          convention who openly favors woman suffrage in any form. It\r\n          is true there are a number of gentlemen who, in private\r\n          conversation, will admit the justice of your plea, but avoid\r\n          it by saying that ladies generally neither demand nor desire\r\n          the right to vote. The truth is, these men (and society is\r\n          full of them) have not the moral courage to do simple\r\n          justice.\r\n\r\n     Thus you see that, so far as the action of this convention is\r\n     concerned, our cause is defeated. Yet I do not feel discouraged.\r\n     I think there is hardly a State in the Union that has such just\r\n     and excellent laws concerning the property rights of women as\r\n     Texas. There is also great liberality of sentiment here\r\n     concerning the avocations of women. But the right of women to the\r\n     ballot seems to be almost a new idea to our people. I have never\r\n     lived in a community where the women are more nearly abreast of\r\n     the men in all the activities of life than here in this frontier\r\n     settlement. In our State a woman's property, real or personal, is\r\n     her own, to keep, to convey, or to bequeath. The unusual number\r\n     of widows here, due to the incursions of the Indians during and\r\n     since the war, has made the management as well as the ownership\r\n     of property by women so common a thing as to attract no notice. I\r\n     might give interesting instances, but that would take time, and\r\n     my point is this, that the laws which have enabled, and the\r\n     circumstances which have driven women to rely upon and to exert\r\n     themselves, have been educational, not only to them, but also to\r\n     the community. The importance of this education to the\r\n     future--who can measure it? It is true that many of them can\r\n     neither read nor write, but in this the men are not in advance of\r\n     them. It as often happens that the woman can read while the man\r\n     cannot, as the reverse. And they are almost universally resolved\r\n     that their children shall not grow up in the ignorance that has\r\n     been their portion. If the women could vote, our convention would\r\n     not think of submitting a constitution that did not secure to the\r\n     State a liberal free school system.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of 1885, after a hard struggle, enacted a law\r\nmaking it compulsory on the heads of all departments to give at\r\nleast one-half of the clerical positions in their respective\r\noffices to women. The action has extraordinary interest, and is\r\nregarded as a victory for the woman's rights party. Mrs. Jenny\r\nBland Beauchamp of Dennison writes:\r\n\r\n     Texas claims to be a woman's State, in that her laws are\r\n     unusually just and lenient to women. A woman who has property at\r\n     marriage can keep it. She can even claim any property that she\r\n     can prove was bought with that money. The wife is entitled to\r\n     half the community whether she owned any of the original stock or\r\n     not. She has a life interest in the homestead; no deed of trust\r\n     can be put upon it, nor can it be mortgaged. It can only be\r\n     conveyed from her by actual sale with her written consent. Under\r\n     our latest revised statutes women have the right of suffrage, but\r\n     have never exercised it; nor is the subject agitated to any great\r\n     extent.\r\n\r\n     Three years ago, when the State University was built, it was\r\n     decided that it should be coeducational, and young women are now\r\n     being educated there side by side with young men. Texas has many\r\n     liberal men and women. It is generally remarked that the women of\r\n     the State are better educated than the men.\r\n\r\n          Miss Julia Pease, a Vassar graduate and daughter of the late\r\n          ex-Governor Pease, has charge of 6,000 acres of land. She\r\n          lives in the family mansion at Austin with her mother, and\r\n          in addition to her other duties superintends the education\r\n          of the three children of her deceased sisters.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Rogers, the \"cattle queen\" of Texas, inherited from her\r\n          first husband a herd of 40,000 cattle. The widow managed the\r\n          business, and in due time married a preacher twenty years\r\n          younger than herself, who had seven children. She attends to\r\n          her estate herself, rides among her cowboys on horseback,\r\n          and can tell just what a steer or cow is worth at any size\r\n          or age.\r\n\r\n          The largest individual sheep-owner is a woman, known all\r\n          over the State as the \"Widow Cullahan.\" Her sheep, more than\r\n          50,000 in number, wander over the ranges of Uvalda and\r\n          Bandern counties, in the southwestern part of the State.\r\n          Their grade is a cross between the hardy Mexican sheep and\r\n          the Vermont merino. They are divided into flocks of 2,000\r\n          head each, with a \"bossero\" and two \"pastoras\" in charge of\r\n          each flock. At the spring and fall shearings long trains of\r\n          wagons transport the \"widow's\" wool to the market at San\r\n          Antonio.\r\n\r\n          Texas has two female dentists. Mrs. Stocking is one of the\r\n          most successful dental surgeons in the State. The other,\r\n          Miss Emma Tibler, went from Kentucky to Texas for the\r\n          purpose of teaching. Finding this profession full, she\r\n          studied dentistry and is now a successful practitioner of\r\n          Cleburne.\r\n\r\n          The youngest telegrapher in the world is probably Hattie\r\n          Hutchinson, in charge of an office in Texas. She is only ten\r\n          years old.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--ARKANSAS.\r\n\r\nUnder date of March, 1868, Miles L. Langley writes from\r\nArkadelphia, Arkansas, in regard to the efforts for equality in the\r\nconstitutional convention:\r\n\r\n                                   ARKADELPHIA, Ark., March 5, 1868.\r\n\r\n     SUSAN B. ANTHONY--_Dear Friend_: With a sad heart but an\r\n     approving conscience, I will give you some information relative\r\n     to the action of our constitutional convention on the franchise\r\n     question.\r\n\r\n     The new constitution--a copy of which I send you--makes no\r\n     difference between men, on account of race or color and contains\r\n     other excellences; but alas! it fails to guarantee to woman her\r\n     God-given and well-earned rights of civil and political equality.\r\n\r\n     I made a motion to insert in the constitution a section to read\r\n     thus: \"All citizens twenty-one years of age, who can read and\r\n     write the English language, shall be eligible to the elective\r\n     franchise, and be entitled to equal political and legal rights\r\n     and privileges.\" The motion was seconded and I had the floor,\r\n     but the House became so clamorous that the president could not\r\n     restore order, and the meeting adjourned with the understanding\r\n     that I was to occupy the floor next morning. But next morning,\r\n     just as I was about to commence my speech, some of the members\r\n     tried to \"bully\" me out of the right to speak on that question. I\r\n     replied that I had been robbed, shot, and imprisoned for\r\n     advocating the rights of the slaves, and that I would then and\r\n     there speak in favor of the rights of women if I had to fight for\r\n     the right! I then proceeded to present arguments of which I am\r\n     not ashamed. I was met with ridicule, sarcasm and insult. My\r\n     ablest opponent, a lawyer, acknowledged in his reply that he\r\n     could not meet my argument. The motion was laid on the table.\r\n\r\n     The Democrats are my enemies because I assisted in emancipating\r\n     the slaves. The Republicans have now become my opponents, because\r\n     I have made an effort to confer on the women their rights. And\r\n     even the women themselves fail to sympathize with me.\r\n\r\n                              Very respectfully,     MILES L. LANGLEY.\r\n\r\n     The Arkansas _Ladies' Journal_ says:\r\n\r\n          They tell us that women are not fit for politics. This may\r\n          be true; and as it is next to impossible to change the\r\n          nature of a woman, why wouldn't it be a good idea to so\r\n          change politics that it shall be fit for women?\r\n\r\n     In 1885, Arkansas formed its first woman suffrage society at\r\n     Eureka Springs through the efforts of Miss Phoebe Couzins, Mrs.\r\n     Lizzie D. Fyler, president. The association numbers some fine\r\n     speakers. The press is not in opposition, one or two papers favor\r\n     the cause.\r\n\r\n     Misses Pettigrew and Sims have been elected clerks of the\r\n     legislature. Several other ladies were candidates for the\r\n     positions, and the contest was quite exciting. Mrs. Simonson and\r\n     Miss Emily Thomas are members of the board of directors of a\r\n     lumber company at Batesville, and Miss Thomas is also bookkeeper\r\n     of the firm.\r\n\r\nA very able report[522] of what has been done in Arkansas for the\r\nelevation of woman was presented by Mrs. Lizzie D. Fyler at the\r\nannual Washington convention in March, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\nMississippi secures to a married woman her own separate estate, and\r\nenables her to contract with her husband, or others, and carry on\r\nbusiness in her own name. She may sue her husband, or others, and\r\nbe sued, and has practically most of her civil rights; but her\r\npolitical rights are denied as in all other States.\r\n\r\n     In 1877 a law was passed by which henceforth no one can legally\r\n     sell liquor in Mississippi unless he can obtain the written\r\n     consent of a majority of the adult citizens of both sexes\r\n     resident in the township.\r\n\r\n     The Mississippi Industrial College for Women held its formal\r\n     opening October 22, 1885, at Columbus. Students had come from all\r\n     parts of the State. More than 300 had already entered. The\r\n     occasion was a brilliant one. Speeches were made by Senator E.\r\n     T. Sykes, Senator J. McMcartin of Claiborne county, Col. J. L.\r\n     Power of Jackson, Hon. James T. Harrison, Governor Lowry, and Dr.\r\n     Jones. Mrs. E. G. Peyton of Hazelhurst, to whose efforts the\r\n     founding of the Industrial College is largely due, was called\r\n     upon, and in a few well-chosen remarks expressed the pride she\r\n     felt in the State and in the college, feeling sure, she said,\r\n     that Mississippi's daughters were now in safe hands.\r\n\r\n     Miss Lilian Light, the eight-year-old daughter of Mr. Jere Light\r\n     of Hayneville, when only five or six years old began to make\r\n     figures in clay, and now (1885) has a large collection of mud\r\n     cats, hogs, dogs, cows, horses, and men. The figures are declared\r\n     to be not childish imitations, but remarkably acute likenesses.\r\n     Her best piece represents a negro praying, and is said to be very\r\n     clever.\r\n\r\n     Miss C. F. Boardman of Elmore's Point, two miles from Biloxi, on\r\n     the Bock Bay, has received the chief premiums awarded for oranges\r\n     grown on the Gulf coast outside of Florida. This lady has 1,000\r\n     bearing orange trees of the choicest varieties, and has devoted\r\n     her attention to the production of these and other tropical\r\n     fruits, with great success. She came to the South for health a\r\n     few years ago, and has not only found that, but has established\r\n     for herself a pleasing and profitable industry in fruit culture.\r\n     Her oranges were exhibited among numerous fine competing\r\n     specimens, and were chosen for high excellence.\r\n\r\n     Miss Eliza A. Dupuy for many years contributed copiously to Mr.\r\n     Bonner's _Ledger_. Miss Dupuy, who was descended from prominent\r\n     Virginia families, was in her youth a teacher. The first story\r\n     written by her was produced when she was only fourteen years old.\r\n     More fortunate than the majority of authors, she leaves behind\r\n     her a considerable sum earned by her ever-busy pen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sarah A. Dorsey was perhaps the most remarkable woman that\r\nMississippi can boast. She was the niece of Mrs. Warfield, the\r\nauthor of the \"Household of Bouverie,\" who had great influence in\r\nforming her literary tastes. The New Orleans Monthly _Review_\r\ncontains many able articles on abstruse questions from her pen.\r\nOne, in the February number for 1876, on the \"Origin of the\r\nSpecies,\" is exceptionally able and interesting. It was read in\r\nOctober, 1875, before the New Orleans Academy of Sciences by Mrs.\r\nDorsey herself. This article shows extensive reading in scientific\r\nquestions. She was made corresponding member of the Academy, an\r\nhonor she appreciated more highly for her sex than for herself. She\r\nwas a large-souled, noble woman, devoted to what she considered\r\nSouthern interests. She bequeathed to Jefferson Davis the estate,\r\ncalled Beauvoir, on which he now resides.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[516] Emily P. Collins of Ponchatoula, Louisiana, wrote Miss\r\nAnthony: \"Our State is to form a new constitution this spring. I\r\nfeel that now if ever is the time to strike for woman's\r\nemancipation. 'We, the people' includes women as well as men, and\r\nregardless of former legislative enactments we should be allowed to\r\nvote and be voted for as delegates to the constitutional\r\nconvention. If I only had some one to aid me, or had your moral\r\ncourage, I would proclaim myself a candidate for the constitutional\r\nconvention. The colored people ought to sustain me for I have ever\r\nbeen their steadfast friend, and they themselves owe their\r\nemancipation chiefly to women. They cannot elect a colored man\r\nhere, but could I have their support I have personal friends enough\r\nto secure my election. The parish ought to be stumped in support of\r\nsome candidate whose efforts should be pledged to the insertion of\r\na clause in the new constitution to prohibit future legislatures\r\nmaking sex a qualification for voting.\"\r\n\r\n[517] The following letter from Mrs. Saxon to Mrs. Minor gives the\r\nreason why she could not be present at the National Convention held\r\nin St. Louis:\r\n\r\n\"Almost entirely unaided I have gained 300 names in five weeks.\r\nAmong them two Presbyterian ministers, wives of three others, seven\r\nof the most prominent physicians, all of the city administrators,\r\ntwo distinguished judges, several lawyers and many leading business\r\nmen. I have begged Mrs. Emily P. Collins to urge upon the\r\nAssociation to meet here next year. I feel that now and before this\r\nconvention is our most important work, so I must stay and try and\r\ninfluence the members all in my power. I was unaware of the action\r\nI was to take here, and if I get before the convention it will not\r\nbe before the morning of the 7th, or I would come anyway as I have\r\nbeen offered a free passage by both rail and river. Mrs. Collins\r\nwas with me for a few days and will assure you of my untiring\r\nefforts in the cause here. God knows I would be willing to buy\r\nfifteen minutes before the whole convention, the day they vote on\r\nthat bill, by the sacrifice of my life; for remembering the grand\r\nwomen I have seen sacrificed along life's path, I think from their\r\nmemory a power and eloquence would spring that might win hearts of\r\nsteel and force justice to women from them. I will write again in a\r\nfew days and report progress.\r\n\r\n                 \"Very sincerely your friend,         E. L. SAXON.\"\r\n\r\n\"_May 5, 1879._\"\r\n\r\n[518] Of her speech Mrs. Merrick writes: \"Fearing that I could not\r\nbe heard, I proposed to my son-in law, Mr. Guthrie, that he should\r\nread it for me, but Mrs. Saxon objected, saying, 'No matter if they\r\ndo not hear a word you say! You do not wish a man to represent you\r\nat the polls; represent yourself now, if you only stand up and move\r\nyour lips.' 'I will,' said I, 'you are right.'--[EDITORS.\r\n\r\n[519] The Claibornes are a distinguished Virginia family, but\r\nbelong to the history of Mississippi and Louisiana since\r\nterritorial times. Mr. Claiborne now regrets that he did not go\r\nfarther, for he is satisfied that women may be trusted with powers\r\nthat have long been withheld. He says he was led to reflect\r\nseriously on the subject by the able addresses of Mrs. Keating,\r\nMrs. Saxon and Mrs. Merrick, who made a profound impression on the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\n[520] The officers of the Christian Woman's Exchange for 1885,\r\nwere: _President_, Mrs. R.

It was originally a portion of Maryland, and\r\nwas ceded to congress by that State for the exclusive use of the\r\nFederal government. Hon. Salmon P. Chase, secretary of the treasury\r\nunder Abraham Lincoln, seeing that most of the gifted young men had\r\nbeen drafted or had enlisted in the army, introduced young women as\r\nclerks in the government departments. The experiment proved\r\nsuccessful, and now there are about six thousand women in the\r\nvarious departments. Mr. Chase often alluded to this afterwards as\r\none of the most important acts of his life. The war brought many\r\nbright, earnest women to Washington, led thither by patriotism,\r\nambition, or the necessity of finding some new employment. This new\r\nvital force, this purer element, infused into the society at the\r\ncapitol, has been slowly introducing more liberal ideas into that\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe first specific work for woman in the District of Columbia of\r\nwhich we find any record was that of Myrtilla Miner of New York,\r\nwho opened a Normal School for colored girls, December 3, 1851. She\r\nbegan with six pupils in a small room in a private house, but soon\r\nhad more offered than could be accommodated. Through much ridicule\r\nand untold difficulties she struggled alone, but successfully, for\r\nten years, when Miss Emily Howland came to her aid. The heroism of\r\nthis noble woman has been told by Mrs. Ellen O. Connor in a little\r\nvolume[523] which is a beautiful tribute to the memory of Miss\r\nMiner. The Miner Normal School of Washington is now a thorough and\r\npopular school for colored girls.\r\n\r\nFor a brief report of what has been accomplished in the District of\r\nColumbia, we are indebted to Belva A. Lockwood:\r\n\r\n     In 1866, the women of Washington were first aroused to the\r\n     consideration of the suffrage question, by the discussion of \"The\r\n     District of Columbia suffrage bill\" proposing to strike out the\r\n     word \"white\" in order to extend the franchise to colored men. Mr.\r\n     Cowan, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, offered an amendment to\r\n     strike out the word \"male\" also, and thus enfranchise the women\r\n     of the District. It was said his proposition was not made in good\r\n     faith, but simply to embarrass Republican legislation. However it\r\n     served a good purpose for all disfranchised classes, as the\r\n     amendment called out a notable debate,[524] lasting three days,\r\n     and received the votes of nine influential senators in its favor.\r\n     The voting of the newly enfranchised negroes at the May election,\r\n     1867, brought out in strong color the beauties of masculine\r\n     legislation, and immediately after there was a movement among the\r\n     friends of woman's enfranchisement. A meeting was called by James\r\n     and Julia Holmes at their residence, where the \"Universal\r\n     Franchise Association\" was organized.[525] As soon as their\r\n     meetings, regularly held, took on a serious air, the combined\r\n     power of the press was brought to bear upon them with the\r\n     determination to break them up. But the meetings were continued,\r\n     notwithstanding the opposition; and although most of the speeches\r\n     were good, they were often interrupted with hisses and yells, and\r\n     the police, when appealed to, failed to keep order, seeming\r\n     rather to join hands with the mob. In order to put a check on the\r\n     rabble, contrary to the spirit of the society, a fee was charged\r\n     at the door. Strangely enough, so great had the interest become,\r\n     the crowd increased instead of lessening, and night after night\r\n     Union League Hall was crowded, until the coffers of the\r\n     association contained nearly $1,000. The press of the city in the\r\n     meantime had kept up a fusilade of ludicrous reports, in which\r\n     the women were caricatured and misrepresented, all of which they\r\n     bore with fortitude, and without any attempt at reply. The\r\n     meetings continued through the year notwithstanding the cry of\r\n     the timid that the cause was being injured and fair reputations\r\n     blighted.\r\n\r\n     June 25, 1868, a deputation from the District Franchise\r\n     Association appeared, by appointment, before the House Committee\r\n     of the District, to urge the passage of the bill presented in the\r\n     House of Representatives by Hon. Henry D. Washburn, accompanied\r\n     by a petition signed by eighty women of the District:\r\n\r\n          \"Be it enacted, etc., That from and after the passage of\r\n          this act, no person shall be debarred from voting or holding\r\n          office in the District of Columbia by reason of sex.\"\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Josephine S. Griffing began by saying that the friends\r\n          of equal freedom for women in the District had thought the\r\n          revision of the local government a fit time to present their\r\n          claims and submit a memorial, setting forth the justice of\r\n          passing the bill before the committee to remove the\r\n          restrictions that forbid women to vote in the District. The\r\n          movement was not wholly new, and was known by those active\r\n          in the work to be approved by a large mass of women who were\r\n          not prepared to express themselves openly. The\r\n          enfranchisement of woman is needful to a real\r\n          reconstruction.\r\n\r\n          Mr. Wilcox read a memorial, signed by a committee of\r\n          residents of the district, consisting of eleven ladies and\r\n          eleven gentlemen, including Mrs. Griffing, Mrs. E. D. E. N.\r\n          Southworth, Miss Lydia S. Hall (formerly of Kansas), Mrs.\r\n          Annie Denton Cridge, Judge A. B. Olin and Mrs. Olin,\r\n          recalling the fact that congress had freed 3,000 slaves, and\r\n          enfranchised the 8,000 colored men of the district, both of\r\n          which experiments had worked well, notwithstanding\r\n          conservative predictions to the contrary; and showing that,\r\n          while the former experiments, on a small scale\r\n          comparatively, had yielded rich results, so the\r\n          enfranchisement of half the adult population would produce\r\n          vast good. He incidentally answered the usual arguments\r\n          against suffrage, and affirmed that those who possess\r\n          neither the power of wealth nor of knowledge wherewith to\r\n          protect themselves, most need political power for that\r\n          purpose. He remarked that the competition for votes among\r\n          politicians was a tremendous educating force, and that laws\r\n          would not be certain of enforcement unless those for whose\r\n          benefit they were made were clothed with power to compel\r\n          such enforcement.\r\n\r\n          Mrs. Mary T. Corner presented a number of points as to the\r\n          laws of the district relating to women, of some of which\r\n          Judge Welker took notes with a view to their speedy\r\n          investigation by the committee. As to suffrage, she pointed\r\n          out that women do not come under the head of paupers,\r\n          minors, felons, rebels, idiots or aliens, and that the\r\n          reasons existing for the disfranchisement of such persons do\r\n          not apply to native-born, loyal women. She showed that women\r\n          are not represented in the government of the district,\r\n          though taxed by it, and by law cannot properly protect\r\n          themselves, their children, or their property, nor hold\r\n          municipal office, however fit. A wife cannot hold property\r\n          in the district except by proxy. Women understand their\r\n          needs and condition better than men, and should be free to\r\n          regulate them. The swarms of foreigners who are freely\r\n          admitted to the polls know less of our institutions than the\r\n          masses of our women. Women have voted and held the highest\r\n          offices in other countries with great success. Are our women\r\n          less capable than these? At the conclusion Mrs. Corner\r\n          returned thanks to the committee for their attention; and\r\n          the latter, without expressing an opinion on the matter,\r\n          complimented the speakers on the ability and eloquence with\r\n          which their views had been presented. It was also stated\r\n          that a large number of petitions would be presented in\r\n          support of the bill. The committee expressed themselves as\r\n          unable, by reason of the lateness of the session and the\r\n          pressure of other business, to promise an early report. The\r\n          interview lasted about an hour, and was very cordial and\r\n          pleasant on both sides.\r\n\r\n     September 25, 1868, the Universal Franchise Association held its\r\n     first annual meeting[526] at Union League Hall, Mrs. Josephine S.\r\n     Griffing presiding. A letter was read from Senator Pomeroy,\r\n     stating that he was willing to act as president of the society.\r\n     In closing he said:\r\n\r\n          I trust the friends will unite in one association. We have\r\n          but one object in view, and should all labor together to\r\n          accomplish this end, viz.: the enfranchisement of every\r\n          citizen, with no partiality for race or sex. The American\r\n          citizen is the only safe depository for the ballot, and the\r\n          only safeguard for individual and national liberty. Let us\r\n          labor to realize, even in our day and time, this true type\r\n          of republican government. The rights and safety of\r\n          individuals and of the nation demand it.\r\n\r\n     In 1869, the executive committee passed a resolution to expend\r\n     the money that had been accumulated at the meetings of the\r\n     association in a series of lectures for the purpose of\r\n     enlightening the public mind upon the question of equal political\r\n     rights for women. Among the speakers engaged were Anna Dickinson,\r\n     Mrs. Stanton, Miss Anthony, D. R. Locke (Nasby), Theodore Tilton.\r\n     From that time the women of the district were permitted to speak\r\n     their minds freely.\r\n\r\n     In the House of Representatives, March 21, 1870, Mr. Arnell, on\r\n     leave, introduced the following bill:\r\n\r\n          _A bill to do justice to the female employees of the\r\n          Government, and for other purposes._\r\n\r\n          Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of\r\n          the United States of America in Congress assembled, That\r\n          hereafter all clerks and other employes in the civil service\r\n          of the United States shall be paid, irrespective of sex,\r\n          with reference to the character and amount of services\r\n          performed by them.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That, in the employment\r\n          of labor, clerical or other, in any branch of the civil\r\n          service of the United States, no discrimination shall be\r\n          made in favor of either sex.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 3. And be it further enacted, That where examinations\r\n          of candidates for positions in the civil service of the\r\n          United States are prescribed by law, or by the heads of\r\n          departments, bureaus, or offices, said examinations shall be\r\n          of the same character for persons of both sexes.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 4. And be it further enacted, That the designations,\r\n          chief clerk, chief or head of division, chief or head of\r\n          section, clerk of the fourth class, clerk of the third\r\n          class, clerk of the second class, clerk of the first class,\r\n          copyist, messenger, laborer, and all other designations of\r\n          employes, in existing acts of Congress, or in use in any\r\n          branch of the civil service of the United States, shall be\r\n          held, hereafter to apply to women as well as to men; and\r\n          that women shall be regarded equally eligible with men to\r\n          perform the duties of the afore-designated clerks and\r\n          employes, and shall receive the compensation therefor\r\n          prescribed by law.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 5. And be it further enacted, That this act shall not\r\n          be so construed as to require the displacement of any person\r\n          now employed, but shall apply to all vacancies hereafter\r\n          occurring, for any cause.\r\n\r\n          SEC. 6. And be it further enacted, That all acts and parts\r\n          of acts, in conflict with any of the provisions of this act\r\n          be, and the same are hereby, expressly repealed.\r\n\r\n     Thousands of petitions for this bill were circulated. Mrs.\r\n     Lockwood went to New York, and secured seven hundred signatures,\r\n     visiting both of the suffrage conventions then in session in that\r\n     city, the National and the American. The bill was shortly\r\n     afterward passed in a modified form, and has ever since been in\r\n     force in all of the government departments.\r\n\r\n     In February, 1871, congress passed the organic act for the\r\n     district, making of it a territory and granting suffrage to the\r\n     male members of the commonwealth. There was also granted under\r\n     this bill a right to a delegate in congress. In the meetings\r\n     which followed for the nomination of delegates a number of women\r\n     took part. Mrs. Lockwood often broke the monotony with a short\r\n     speech, and on one occasion only lacked one vote of an election\r\n     to the general convention for the nomination of a delegate to\r\n     congress.\r\n\r\n     The women of the district were not permitted to vote under the\r\n     organic act, but soon after the organization of its legislature,\r\n     bills to provide for this were introduced into both Houses. Mrs.\r\n     Lockwood prepared an exhaustive address upon these pending bills,\r\n     and was granted a hearing before both Houses of the legislature,\r\n     but they were finally lost. In 1875 congress withdrew the\r\n     legislative power from the people of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n     It was also in 1871 that the National University Law School, then\r\n     principally under the control of Prof. Wm. B. Wedgewood,\r\n     organized a law class for women, in which fifteen matriculated.\r\n     Mrs. Lockwood had been denied admission the previous year to the\r\n     law class of Columbia College for the reason, as given by the\r\n     trustees, \"that it would distract the attention of the young\r\n     men.\" About this time a young colored woman, Charlotte Ray of New\r\n     York, was graduated from the law class of Howard University and\r\n     admitted to the bar with the class. Of the fifteen women who\r\n     entered the National University only two completed the course,\r\n     viz., Lydia S. Hall, and Belva A. Lockwood. The former never\r\n     received her diploma. The latter, after an appeal to President\r\n     Grant, received her diploma, and was admitted to the district\r\n     bar, September 23, 1873. Since that period Emma M. Gillett,\r\n     Marilla M. Ricker, and Laura DeForce Gordon have been admitted to\r\n     the district bar, and there seems to be no longer any hindrance\r\n     to such admissions. The above-named have all appeared in court,\r\n     and a number of other ladies have been graduated in the district.\r\n     Women have also been appointed notaries public, and examiners in\r\n     chancery.\r\n\r\n     In the profession of medicine there has been more liberality. Dr.\r\n     Susan A. Edson and Dr. Caroline B. Winslow have been in full\r\n     practice here since the close of the war. Dr. Mary Parsons and\r\n     Dr. Cora M. Bland and others, are practicing with marked success.\r\n     Last year there were fourteen women duly registered with the\r\n     health department, and they all seem to be in good standing.\r\n     Howard University has admitted women to its medical classes for\r\n     some years, and both white and colored women have availed\r\n     themselves of the privilege. Last year Columbia College opened\r\n     its doors in the medical department, with a suggestion that the\r\n     classes in law and theology may soon be opened also.\r\n\r\n     Many women in the district within the last few years have entered\r\n     into business for themselves, as they are now permitted to do\r\n     under the law of 1869, and are milliners, merchants,\r\n     market-women, hucksters. In the art of nursing, which has been\r\n     reduced to a science, they have free course.\r\n\r\n     In 1871, a large number of ladies tried to register in the city\r\n     of Washington. They marched in solid phalanx some seventy[527]\r\n     strong to the registrar's office, but were repulsed. They tried\r\n     afterwards to vote, but were refused, whereupon Mrs. Spencer sued\r\n     the inspectors, and Mrs. Webster sued the registrars, so testing\r\n     their rights in two suits in the Supreme Court of the\r\n     District.[528]\r\n\r\n     In 1866 Jane G. Swisshelm commenced the publication of a liberal\r\n     sheet in the District of Columbia, known as _The Wasp_. This was\r\n     the continuation of a paper formerly published by her in\r\n     Pittsburg, Pa., and in St. Cloud, Minn., called _The Visitor_.\r\n     Many other papers by women have been since published in the\r\n     District. Perhaps the most voluminous author in this country is\r\n     Mrs. E. D. E. N. Southworth, who has written a volume for each\r\n     year of her life, and is now sixty-five years of age. Her\r\n     authorship has been confined to romances, which have been very\r\n     popular. A large proportion of the teachers of the public schools\r\n     in the District are women, some of them of very marked culture.\r\n     Many of the most noted and successful private schools, some with\r\n     collegiate courses, are conducted by women. Among these, Mrs.\r\n     Margaret Harover who taught in the District during the war, is\r\n     worthy of mention, also Mrs. Ellen M. O'Connor, president of the\r\n     Miner school. Mrs. Sarah J. Spencer, as associate principal of\r\n     the Spencerian business college whence large classes of young\r\n     women have been graduated for many years past, is deservedly\r\n     popular. She was at one time prominent in the woman suffrage\r\n     movement, acting as corresponding secretary of the National\r\n     Association. She is now engaged in one of the large charity\r\n     organizations of the city. Many colored women who have been\r\n     graduated from Howard University, have become quite successful as\r\n     teachers, and some have studied medicine. All of the copyists in\r\n     the office of registrar of deeds are women. A goodly number are\r\n     short-hand reporters for the courts, among whom Miss Camp,\r\n     daughter of the assistant clerk, is notably skillful.\r\n\r\n     The number of women who hold property in the District is large\r\n     and rapidly increasing. A woman may now enter into almost any\r\n     honorable profession that she chooses, and maintain her\r\n     respectability. All of the professions are open to her, and the\r\n     sphere of trades is rapidly widening. The progress made in this\r\n     regard in the last quarter of a century amounts almost to a\r\n     revolution. The first women ever admitted to the reporter's\r\n     gallery of the Senate and House were Abigail Dodge (Gail\r\n     Hamilton), and Helen M. Barnard, both political writers of great\r\n     power; the former as a reporter for the New York _Times_, and the\r\n     latter for the New York _Herald_. Mrs. Barnard, during Grant's\r\n     administration, was sent as commissioner of immigration to\r\n     Liverpool, visiting England, Ireland and Scotland. Returning in\r\n     the steerage of an ocean steamer, she gave one of the finest\r\n     reports ever made upon this question. This resulted in the\r\n     passage by the legislature of New York of a bill for the better\r\n     protection of emigrants on shipboard, and the appointment by the\r\n     United States government of an inspector of immigration for every\r\n     out-going steamer.\r\n\r\n     Women were first appointed as clerks in the government\r\n     departments in 1861 by Secretary Chase, at the earnest\r\n     solicitation of Treasurer Spinner. They were employed at\r\n     temporary work at $50 a month--one-half the lowest price paid to\r\n     any male clerk--until they were recognized by an act of congress\r\n     in which their salary was fixed at $900 a year, in the general\r\n     appropriation bill of July 23, 1866. The men doing the same work\r\n     were of four classes, receiving, respectively, $1,000, $1,400,\r\n     $1,600, $1,800. Treasurer Spinner, in his report of October,\r\n     1866, said:\r\n\r\n          The experiment of employing females as clerks has been, so\r\n          far as this office is concerned, a success. For many kinds\r\n          of office-work, like the manipulation and counting of\r\n          fractional currency, they excel, and in my opinion are to be\r\n          preferred to males. There is, however, quite as much\r\n          difference in point of ability between female clerks as\r\n          there is between the several classes of male clerks, whose\r\n          equals some of them are. Some are able to accomplish twice\r\n          as much as others, and with greater accuracy. So, too, some\r\n          of them incur great risks, being responsible for making\r\n          mistakes in count, and for counterfeits overlooked. Such\r\n          should, by every consideration of justice and fair dealing,\r\n          be paid according to their merits, and the risks and\r\n          liabilities they incur.\r\n\r\n     And in 1868, Mr. Spinner urged the committee of which Mr.\r\n     Fessenden of Maine was the chairman, to so amend the bill\r\n     providing for the reorganization of the treasury department as to\r\n     increase the salary of the female clerks who have the handling of\r\n     money, stating that cases had occurred in which women had lost\r\n     more than half their monthly pay by reason of being short in\r\n     count, or of allowing counterfeit notes to pass their hands.\r\n\r\n     Secretary M'Cullough asserted that women performed their clerical\r\n     duties as creditably as men, and stated that he had three ladies\r\n     who performed as much labor, and did it as well as any three male\r\n     clerks receiving $1,800 a year. It is now a quarter of a century\r\n     that women have served the government in these responsible\r\n     positions, and still, with but few exceptions, they receive only\r\n     the allotted $900. Mrs. Fitzgerald, the expert in the redemption\r\n     bureau of the treasury, who has for fifteen years deciphered\r\n     defaced currency, in which no man has ever yet proved her equal,\r\n     receives $1,400. In 1886 she subjected herself to an examination\r\n     for an increase to $1,600, but, failing to answer some questions\r\n     foreign to her art, she was compelled to content herself with the\r\n     former salary.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n_The Revolution_ of February 26, 1868, shows an effort in the\r\ndirection of progress on this question in Maryland. A correspondent\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     Notwithstanding the present ascendancy of conservatism in\r\n     Maryland, the progressive element is not wholly annihilated; in\r\n     proof of which, we send information of the working of this\r\n     leaven, as developed in an association lately organized in the\r\n     city of Baltimore, under the name of the \"Maryland Equal Rights\r\n     Society.\" For nearly a year past it has been in contemplation to\r\n     form a society based upon the principle of equal chance to all\r\n     human kind, irrespective of sex or color, through the mediumship\r\n     of the elective franchise. The first public meeting of the\r\n     friends of the movement was held on the afternoon of November 12,\r\n     1867, at the Douglass Institute, at which twelve persons, white\r\n     and colored, were present. Some steps were taken towards\r\n     organization in the framing and adopting of a constitution based\r\n     upon the principle afore-mentioned; but further business was\r\n     deferred in hope of securing a larger attendance at a subsequent\r\n     meeting. Two weeks later a second meeting was called, when the\r\n     constitution was signed by fourteen persons, ten of whom were\r\n     white and four colored. Officers were chosen, consisting of a\r\n     president, a vice-president, a secretary and a treasurer,\r\n     together with eight other members to act as an executive\r\n     committee. The last meeting, held January 29, was attended by\r\n     Alfred H. Love and Rachel Love of Philadelphia. To Mr. Love the\r\n     society is indebted for many valuable suggestions as to the best\r\n     means of becoming an effective co-worker in the cause of human\r\n     progress.\r\n\r\n     Our colored friends, who have control of the Douglass Institute,\r\n     have testified their good will toward the movement in giving the\r\n     society the use of an apartment in the building, free of charge.\r\n     This is the one instance in which we have met with encouragement\r\n     in our own community. We have sought it in high places, among\r\n     those we supposed to be friends, and found it not. It appears to\r\n     be the nature of fine linen to dread the mud splashes of the\r\n     pioneer's spade and pick-ax, and for silk and broadcloth to\r\n     shrink from contact with the briers of an uncleared thicket;\r\n     hence our sole recourse is to appeal to those only who are\r\n     dressed for the service. We are conscious that we have entered\r\n     upon no easy task; but, ashamed of having so long left our\r\n     Northern sisters to toil and endure alone in a cause which is not\r\n     one of section but of humanity, we come forward at last to assume\r\n     our share of the hardship, trusting that what we have lost in our\r\n     tardiness may be made up in earnestness and activity.\r\n\r\nFrom various papers we clip the following items:\r\n\r\n     At the election in Baltimore, January 20, 1870, there were three\r\n     women who applied to be registered as voters at the third-ward\r\n     registry office. Their names were Mrs. L. C. Dundore, Mrs. A. M.\r\n     Gardner and Miss E. M. Harris. Their cases were held under\r\n     advisement by the register.----In 1871, a Maryland young lady,\r\n     Miss Middlebrook, raised over 5,000 heads of cabbage. On\r\n     Christmas, she sold in the Baltimore market 500 pounds of turkey\r\n     at 20 cents per pound.----Mrs. H. B. Conway of Frederick county,\r\n     has established a reputation as a contractor for \"fills\" and\r\n     \"cuts.\" She has filled several contracts in Pennsylvania, been\r\n     awarded a $100,000 job on the Western Maryland railroad, and now,\r\n     1885, is engaged in the work of excavating a tract in Baltimore\r\n     for building-sites.\r\n\r\nMiss R. Muller has for several years been engaged as subscription\r\nand general correspondence clerk for the Baltimore _Daily\r\nAmerican_. She was the first woman to be employed in that city on\r\nnewspaper work during the present century. In the chapter on\r\nnewspapers it will be seen that Anna R. Green established the first\r\nnewspaper in the Maryland colony one hundred and nineteen years\r\nago, doing the colony printing; and that Mary R. Goddard not only\r\npublished a paper, writing able editorials, but was also the first\r\npostmaster after the revolution. And from the following item it\r\nwould seem that the first woman to claim her right to vote must be\r\ncredited to Maryland:\r\n\r\n     At the regular meeting of the Maryland Historical Society in\r\n     Baltimore, December, 1885, Hon. J. L. Thomas read a paper on\r\n     \"Margaret Brent, the first woman in America to claim the right\r\n     to vote.\" She lived at St. Mary's city on the river of the same\r\n     name two hundred and forty years ago, and was related to Lord\r\n     Baltimore. She was the heir of Leonard Calvert, Lord Baltimore's\r\n     brother and agent, and as such she claimed not only control of\r\n     all rents, etc., of Lord Baltimore, but also the right to two\r\n     votes in the assembly as the representative of both Calvert and\r\n     Baltimore. The first claim the courts upheld, but the second was\r\n     rejected.\r\n\r\nOn March 20, 1872, Hon. Stevenson Archer made an exhaustive speech\r\non the floor of the House of Representatives, entitled, \"Woman\r\nSuffrage not to be tolerated, although advocated by the Republican\r\ncandidate for vice-presidency.\" The speech was against Senator\r\nWilson's bill to enfranchise the women of the territories. The\r\nhonorable representative from Maryland may have been moved to enter\r\nhis protest against woman's enfranchisement by the fact that the\r\nwomen of his State had in convention assembled early in the same\r\nmonth made a public demand for their political rights:\r\n\r\n     The Havre de Grace _Republican_ says that the convention of the\r\n     Maryland Equal Rights Association, held in Raine's Hall,\r\n     Baltimore, last week, was a grand success. Mrs. Lavina C.\r\n     Dundore, president of the association, presided over the\r\n     convention with dignity and grace. Many prominent and able\r\n     champions of the cause were present and delivered eloquent and\r\n     telling addresses in favor of woman's enfranchisement, which were\r\n     listened to with marked attention by the large audiences in\r\n     attendance. The friends of the cause in Maryland feel much\r\n     gratified at this exhibition of the rapidly increasing interest\r\n     in the movement.\r\n\r\nMeetings had been held in Baltimore during the years of 1870-71,\r\nand lectures given by Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe, Susan B.\r\nAnthony, and others.\r\n\r\nCharlotte Richmond of Baltimore writes the _Woman's Journal_, April\r\n22, 1873:\r\n\r\n     The American _Journal of Dental Science_ makes the following\r\n     statement: \"The Baltimore College of Dental Surgery, having had\r\n     the honor of conferring the first degree of Doctor of Dental\r\n     Surgery in the world, has also graduated the first woman who ever\r\n     received a diploma in medicine or dentistry in Baltimore, in the\r\n     person of Miss Emilie Foeking of Prussia, who, after attending\r\n     two full courses of lectures and demonstrations, passed a very\r\n     creditable final examination. Miss Foeking conformed to all the\r\n     rules and regulations of the college during the two sessions that\r\n     she was a student; no favor whatever as to requirement being\r\n     asked for on her part, or extended to her by the faculty, on\r\n     account of sex. She has fairly earned her degree by proficiency\r\n     and earnest application. After a short time Miss Foeking will\r\n     return to Berlin, where she intends to locate. That she will\r\n     succeed in establishing a large and lucrative practice, there is\r\n     no doubt, as she is well qualified professionally, and is in\r\n     manner so perfect a lady as to command the respect of all who\r\n     know her.\"\r\n\r\n     You will see by this extract from one of our medical journals,\r\n     that a lady has been graduated from our dental college. I hope\r\n     she has left the doors open, so that some of our own countrywomen\r\n     may enter and acquit themselves as honorably, but without the\r\n     difficulties which she has been compelled to encounter. You are\r\n     aware of the proceedings of the Philadelphia college in regard to\r\n     female students. Our Baltimore dentist, for we feel proud to\r\n     claim her as ours, although admitted in the college, still had\r\n     all the prejudices to meet in the minds of the people, but they\r\n     were too courteous and hospitable to act upon those feelings so\r\n     far as to turn her from their doors. She was brave and did not\r\n     surrender; not even when her sensitive woman's heart was wounded\r\n     and humiliated by the little acts done heedlessly under the\r\n     impression that a woman had stepped out of her sphere and was\r\n     taking upon herself a vocation belonging exclusively to men. She\r\n     is naturally sincere, modest and dignified. With these lady-like\r\n     qualifications, together with ability and perseverance, she has\r\n     won the honor and esteem of the faculty and the students.\r\n\r\n     I wish that Prussia could have witnessed the success of her\r\n     daughter on the night of commencement--the wreaths of laurel, and\r\n     the incessant applause while she was on the stage. I, for one,\r\n     felt quite proud to see my city acknowledge the foreign\r\n     lady-student so gracefully. She is already practicing to some\r\n     extent, and in every case gives the most entire satisfaction. I\r\n     trust there will be no more college doors closed against our sex,\r\n     for the reason that the male students do not want us. Let the\r\n     professors and trustees be just. We have proved that a true lady\r\n     is no disadvantage in a college with male students. I think the\r\n     way is now clear for women to enter upon the dental profession.\r\n     Miss Foeking has proved that a woman can be successful when she\r\n     undertakes an honorable profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mary B. Clay]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the facts in regard to the Baltimore Dental College we are\r\nindebted to the dean of the faculty:\r\n\r\n                    BALTIMORE COLLEGE OF DENTAL SURGERY, Jan. 2, 1886.\r\n\r\n     MISS SUSAN B. ANTHONY--_Dear Miss_: Your letter of 27th of last\r\n     month came safely to hand. In reply I will say that only two\r\n     members of the fair sex have been graduated with us. Miss Emilie\r\n     Foeking of Prussia, whose present address I do not know, and Miss\r\n     Pauline Boeck of Germany, who has since died. Miss Foeking was\r\n     graduated in 1873, and Miss Boeck in 1877. I have learned that\r\n     both of these young ladies were attentive and energetic in the\r\n     pursuit of their studies, and were graduated with credit to\r\n     themselves. We have the \"Woman's Medical College,\" from which\r\n     quite a number of young women have been graduated. For\r\n     information in regard to this institution I would refer you to\r\n     its dean, Prof. Wm. D. Booker, 157 Park avenue.\r\n\r\n                                   Very truly yours,     R. B. WINDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--DELAWARE.\r\n\r\nMary A. Stuart is the active representative of the movement for\r\nwoman suffrage in Delaware. From year to year she has written and\r\ncontributed to our National conventions in Washington, and has been\r\namong the delegates on several occasions to address congressional\r\ncommittees. In her report she says:\r\n\r\n     My father was the first man in the State Senate to propose the\r\n     repeal of some of our oppressive laws, and succeeded in having\r\n     the law giving all real estate to the eldest male heir repealed.\r\n     The law of 1871 gave a married woman the right to make a will,\r\n     provided her husband gave his written consent, with the names of\r\n     two respectable witnesses thereunto attached. In 1873 the law was\r\n     repealed, and another act passed giving married women the right\r\n     to make a will, buy property and hold it exempt from the\r\n     husband's debts, but this law does not affect his tenancy by\r\n     courtesy.\r\n\r\n     Prior to 1868, bonds, mortgages, stocks, etc., were counted\r\n     personal property, all of which went into the possession of the\r\n     husband the moment the woman answered \"I will,\" in the marriage\r\n     ceremony. I worked hard to get the law passed giving the wife the\r\n     right to her own separate earnings, and at last was greatly\r\n     helped by the fact that a woman petitioned for a divorce, stating\r\n     in her application that she was driven from her home, that she\r\n     and her two children had worked hard and saved $100 for a rainy\r\n     day, and now her husband claimed the money. It was a case in\r\n     point, and helped the members of our legislature to pass the\r\n     wages bill.\r\n\r\n     Delaware College, the only institution of the kind in the State,\r\n     was open to girls for thirteen years, but owing to a tragedy\r\n     committed by the boys in hazing one another, resulting in death,\r\n     the doors were thereafter closed to girls, although they were in\r\n     no way directly or indirectly implicated in the outrages. When\r\n     Governor Stockley was appealed to, he simply gave some of the old\r\n     arguments against coeducation, and did not recommend, as he\r\n     should have done, an appropriation at once by the State to build\r\n     a similar college, with all the necessary appointments for the\r\n     education of girls. We have women who are practicing physicians,\r\n     and are also in the State Medical Boards. We have none who\r\n     practice law or preach in our pulpits, and all the political\r\n     offices of the State are closed to women. No notaries, bank\r\n     cashiers, telegraph operators. Women are still in the belief that\r\n     work outside the home is a disgrace to the men of their families.\r\n\r\n     In February, 1881, Mrs. Stanton, Miss Anthony, Miss Couzins and\r\n     Mrs. Lockwood, held various hearings before the legislature. Mrs.\r\n     Lockwood read to the gentlemen article 4 of the constitution as\r\n     amended in 1834: \"Any white male citizen over 22 years of age who\r\n     shall be a tax-payer, shall be eligible to vote for electors.\"\r\n     She then showed them how readily, without any marked revolution,\r\n     the word \"white\" had been stricken out, while the word tax-payer\r\n     had virtually become a dead letter. Then turning to the first\r\n     paragraph of the United States revised code she cited the passage\r\n     which states that in determining the meaning of statutes after\r\n     February 25, 1877, \"words importing the masculine gender may be\r\n     applied to females.\" * * * * At this point the chairman of the\r\n     committee placed before Mrs. Lockwood the Delaware code from\r\n     which she read a similar application of the law made many years\r\n     before. Having laid this foundation she asserted that the women\r\n     of Delaware were legally entitled to vote under the laws as they\r\n     are, but that to prevent all question on the subject, she would\r\n     recommend a special enactment like that prepared in the bill\r\n     before them. An amendment to the State constitution giving\r\n     suffrage to women was presented in the House of Representatives\r\n     in February, 1881, and referred to the committee on privileges\r\n     and elections. It was reported adversely. The vote showed that\r\n     all the members, with two[529] exceptions, were opposed to the\r\n     measure.\r\n\r\nAmong the friends in Delaware were several liberal families, active\r\nin all the progressive movements of the day. Preeminent among these\r\nwas that of the noble Thomas Garrett, whose good words of\r\nencouragement for woman's enfranchisement may be found in the bound\r\ncopies of _The Revolution_ as far back as 1868. His private letters\r\nto those of us interested in his labors of love are among our most\r\ncherished mementoes. He was a man of good judgment, broad\r\nsympathies, and unswerving integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--KENTUCKY.\r\n\r\nMary B. Clay, daughter of Cassius M. Clay, sends us the following\r\nreport of what has been done to change the status of women in\r\nKentucky:\r\n\r\n     The earliest agitation of the suffrage question in our State\r\n     arose from the advent of Miss Lucy Stone in Louisville, in 1853,\r\n     at which time she delivered three lectures in Masonic Hall to\r\n     crowded audiences. George D. Prentice gave full and friendly\r\n     reports in the _Courier-Journal_. In later years, Anna Dickinson\r\n     and others have lectured in our chief cities. But the first note\r\n     of associated effort is that given in _The Revolution_ from\r\n     Glendale, which says:\r\n\r\n          We organized here an association with twenty members the\r\n          first of October, 1867, and now have fifty. We hope soon to\r\n          have the whole of Hardin county, and by the close of another\r\n          year the whole of the State of Kentucky, enlisted on the\r\n          side of woman's rights.\r\n\r\n     In the winter of 1872 Hannah Tracy Cutler and Margaret V. Longley\r\n     were granted a respectful hearing before our legislature at\r\n     Frankfort. In May, 1879, self-appointed, I represented Kentucky\r\n     at the May anniversary of the National Association at St. Louis.\r\n     In the autumn following, Miss Anthony, during an extended lecture\r\n     tour through the State, stopped in Richmond several days, and\r\n     aided us in organizing a local suffrage society.[530] Letters\r\n     were at once written to the leading editors asking them to\r\n     publish articles on the subject. Many favorable answers were\r\n     received, and we have largely availed ourselves of the columns of\r\n     the papers to keep up the agitation. My sister, Sally Clay\r\n     Bennett, edits a column in the Richmond _Register_, sister Anne a\r\n     column in the Lexington _Gazette_, and Kate Dunning Clarke, a\r\n     column in the _Turf, Field and Farm_. Mrs. Clarke is also\r\n     associate editor of the Kentucky _State Journal_. The Misses\r\n     Moore are making a success of a daily paper at Milledgeville.\r\n\r\n     In May, 1880, Mrs. Bennett and myself were delegates at the great\r\n     National Mass Convention in Farwell Hall, Chicago. In October,\r\n     1881, the American Association held its annual meeting in\r\n     Louisville. It was largely attended and fully and fairly reported\r\n     by the press of the city. At its close, a Kentucky State\r\n     association was organized, with Laura Clay as president.\r\n\r\n     In January, 1882, the Richmond and Louisville clubs secured a\r\n     hearing before the judiciary committee of the Senate, Mrs.\r\n     Bennett and myself representing the former, and John A. Ward the\r\n     latter. With the valuable aid of Mrs. Mary Haggart of\r\n     Indianapolis we made a most favorable impression upon our\r\n     legislators. The points in which our laws are defective and upon\r\n     which our appeals and arguments were based are well indicated by\r\n     the pleas of our several petitions:\r\n\r\n          That women might have municipal and presidential suffrage by\r\n          statute; that in marriage women might own their property as\r\n          men own theirs; that women who were married might be the\r\n          legal guardians of their children's property and persons as\r\n          well as the father; that women should be appointed with\r\n          equal responsibility and authority as assistant physicians\r\n          in insane asylums, and that the appointment of all the\r\n          officers in such asylums should be made by the legislature,\r\n          and not by the governor, as now; that women be appointed on\r\n          boards of visitors and commissioners to all asylums where\r\n          women are inmates or prisoners.\r\n\r\n     In 1884, all of the Clay sisters--Mrs. Bennet, Mary, Laura and\r\n     Anne--with Mrs. Haggart, again went to Frankfort, and held\r\n     meetings in the legislative hall, which were largely attended by\r\n     the best classes of the citizens of that city, as well as by\r\n     members of the legislature.\r\n\r\n     For several years we have had a woman for State Librarian. In\r\n     Fayette, one of our most aristocratic counties, Lexington being\r\n     its county seat, a woman was elected to the office of county\r\n     clerk by a majority of 200 over her male competitor. In two other\r\n     counties women are also county clerks. Each of them had served so\r\n     efficiently in her husband's office, that at his death she had\r\n     been elected in his place.\r\n\r\n     That woman has to fight every step of her way to the recognition\r\n     of her rights as a citizen equal before the law, is shown by the\r\n     following despatch from Frankfort, dated December 18, 1885:\r\n\r\n          Mrs. M. C. Lucas was elected by the vote of Daviess county\r\n          to the office of jailer, to succeed her husband, who was\r\n          killed by a mob while in discharge of his duty. When she\r\n          appeared before the county court to give bond for the\r\n          office, the Judge refused to allow her to qualify. A writ of\r\n          mandamus from the Circuit Court was applied for to compel\r\n          the court to allow her to qualify, but the motion was\r\n          denied. An appeal was then taken to the Court of Appeals.\r\n          Yesterday that court affirmed the decision of the Circuit\r\n          Court, that a woman cannot legally hold the office of county\r\n          jailer.\r\n\r\n     A woman in Madison county acted as census-taker, and performed\r\n     her duty well. She was the niece of Mr. Justice Miller of the\r\n     Supreme Court of the United States. Gen. W. J. Sanderson,\r\n     internal revenue collector for the eighth district, employed two\r\n     young ladies as clerks, Miss Brown and Miss Price, the former of\r\n     whom is said to be his best clerk. She is the sister of Mrs.\r\n     Smith, the circuit clerk of Laurel county. The successor of\r\n     General Sanderson, employs his two daughters as clerks, and they\r\n     receive the same pay as men who do the same work.\r\n\r\n     Many women in our State manage their own farms. My mother, during\r\n     my father's absence as minister to Russia, took his farm of 2,500\r\n     acres (he making her his attorney), paid off a large debt on the\r\n     property, built an elegant house costing $30,000, stocked the\r\n     farm, and largely supported the family of six children, with\r\n     money which she made during the war. She fed government mules,\r\n     and did it so well that she would return them to camp before the\r\n     time expired, in better condition than most feeders got theirs.\r\n     She is now, 1885, conducting her own farm of 350 acres, selling\r\n     several thousand dollars' worth of wheat, cattle, and sheep\r\n     annually, giving her personal attention to everything, at the age\r\n     of seventy. During the adventurous and perilous period of my\r\n     father's life she shared his dangers, and was ever his mainstay\r\n     in upholding his hands against slavery; and in that crowning\r\n     point of his life, when he was mobbed in Lexington, my mother sat\r\n     at his bed-side, and wrote at his dictation, \"Go tell your secret\r\n     conclave of dastardly assassins, Cassius M. Clay knows his rights\r\n     and how to defend them.\"\r\n\r\n     Two of my sisters, Laura and Anne, and myself are practical\r\n     farmers, each having under her immediate superintendence the\r\n     workmen, both white and black, on 300 acres. We raise corn,\r\n     wheat, oats, cattle and sheep, buying and selling our own stock\r\n     and produce. We took possession of the land without stock or\r\n     utensils, and by our observation and experience, prudence and\r\n     industry, have greatly improved the lands and stock, and annually\r\n     realize a handsome income therefrom.\r\n\r\n     Miss Laura R. White of Manchester, sister of Hon. John D. White,\r\n     who ably advocated our cause in congress as well as in his own\r\n     State, was graduated with marked honor from the Michigan State\r\n     University in 1874. Since that time she has studied architecture\r\n     in the Boston Institute of Technology one year, worked as\r\n     draughtsman in the office of the supervisory architect of the\r\n     treasury department at Washington, two years, studied in the\r\n     special school of architecture in Paris one year, and is now,\r\n     1886, prosecuting her studies with a liberal selection of French\r\n     and English architectural works at her mountain home in Kentucky.\r\n     Mrs. Bessie White Heagen, the youngest daughter of Mrs. Sarah A.\r\n     White, was graduated with honor from the Roxbury High School of\r\n     Boston, and from the school of Pharmacy of Michigan University.\r\n     Being denied examination and the privileges of college graduates\r\n     of the college of pharmacy at Louisville, where she was employed\r\n     by a prominent pharmacist, she brought suit and obtained a\r\n     verdict in her favor.\r\n\r\n     Early in 1882, Dr. J. P. Barnum employed young women in his store\r\n     with the expectation of being able to educate them in the college\r\n     of pharmacy. But the hostility of the students to the proposed\r\n     innovation, and the lack of a systematic laboratory course,\r\n     caused the relinquishment of that plan and the formation of the\r\n     new school. Prominent gentlemen in the community assisted Dr.\r\n     Barnum, and the Louisville School of Pharmacy was duly\r\n     incorporated under the general laws of Kentucky.[531] Though\r\n     sustained by men of wealth and influence, the school met with\r\n     great opposition, the State Board of Pharmacy refusing to\r\n     register the women who were graduated from it until compelled to\r\n     do so by a mandamus from the Law and Equity Court, Judge Simral\r\n     presiding. March 7, 1884, the legislature incorporated the\r\n     Louisville School of Pharmacy for Women, and by special enactment\r\n     empowered its graduates to practice their profession without\r\n     registration or interference from the State board.\r\n\r\n     The school confers two degrees; its full course taking three\r\n     years and requiring more work than is done in other schools. So\r\n     far its graduates have been representative women, and all have\r\n     found responsible situations awaiting them. Its faculty remains,\r\n     with a few exceptions, as in the first session. Dr. J. P. Barnum,\r\n     to whose indefatigable efforts the foundation of the school is\r\n     due, is dean and professor of pharmacy and analytical chemistry;\r\n     Dr. T. Hunt Stuckey, a graduate of Heidelberg University, who\r\n     joined his efforts with Dr. Barnum at an early day, is professor\r\n     of _materia medica_, toxicology and microscopy. Mrs. D. N.\r\n     Marble, professor of general and pharmaceutical chemistry, and\r\n     Mrs. Fountaine Miller, professor of botany, were graduates of the\r\n     first class.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Kate Trimble de Roode, in a recent letter says:\r\n\r\n          Kentucky has had school suffrage for thirty years, but as\r\n          the right is not generally known or understood, few women\r\n          have ever availed themselves of the privilege. The State\r\n          librarian has for many years been a woman, and there are\r\n          several post-mistresses also in this State. The State\r\n          University has recently admitted women on equal terms to all\r\n          its departments. As a general thing the young women of\r\n          Kentucky are better educated than the men, the latter being\r\n          early put to business, while most parents desire above all\r\n          things to secure to their daughters a liberal education. We\r\n          have a number of women practicing medicine in the larger\r\n          cities, one architect, but as yet no lawyers, although\r\n          several women have taken a full course of study for that\r\n          profession. The question of woman suffrage has been but\r\n          little agitated in this State, although the last\r\n          legislature gave a respectful hearing to several ladies on\r\n          the question. The property rights of married women are in a\r\n          crude state; the wife's personal property vests in the\r\n          husband; the profits and rents that accrue from her real\r\n          estate belong to him also. She can make no will without the\r\n          assent of her husband, and if given, he can revoke it at any\r\n          time before the will is probated. The wife's wages belong to\r\n          her husband. She cannot sue or be sued without he joins her\r\n          in the suit. The wife's dower is a life interest in a third\r\n          of the husband's real estate, whereas the husband's curtesy,\r\n          where there is issue of the marriage, born alive, is a life\r\n          interest in all the real estate belonging to the wife at the\r\n          time of her death. This is the statutory law, but the wife\r\n          by obtaining a decree in chancery may possess all the rights\r\n          of a _femme sole_. A bill securing more equal rights to\r\n          women passed the House of the last legislature, but failed\r\n          in the Senate. The courtesy of Kentucky men to women in\r\n          general, has kept them from realizing their civil and\r\n          political degradation, until, by some sudden turn in the\r\n          wheel of fortune, the individual woman has felt the iron\r\n          teeth of the law in her own flesh, and warned her slumbering\r\n          sisterhood. We are now awaking to the fact that an\r\n          aristocracy of sex in a republic is as inconsistent and\r\n          odious as an aristocracy of color, and indeed far more so.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--TENNESSEE.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Mrs. Elizabeth Lisle Saxon for the following:\r\n\r\n     Elizabeth Avery Meriwether is the chief representative of liberal\r\n     thought in Tennessee. Her pen is ever ready to champion the\r\n     wronged. I first came to know her when engaged in a newspaper\r\n     discussion to reestablish in the public schools of Memphis three\r\n     young women who had been dismissed because of \"holding too many\r\n     of Mrs. Meriwether's views\"--the reason actually given by the\r\n     superintendent and endorsed by the board of directors. A seven\r\n     month's war was carried on, ending in a triumphant reinstallment\r\n     of the teachers, a new superintendent, and a new board of\r\n     directors. Public opinion was educated into more liberal ideas,\r\n     and the _Memphis Appeal_, through its chivalrous editor, Mr.\r\n     Keating, declared squarely for woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n     When Col. Kerr introduced into the Tennessee legislature a bill\r\n     making divorce impossible for any cause save adultery, Mrs.\r\n     Meriwether wrote the ablest article I ever read, in opposition,\r\n     which Mr. Keating published in his paper, and distributed among\r\n     the members of the legislature. The result was a clear vote\r\n     against the bill.\r\n\r\n     With Mrs. Lide Meriwether and Mrs. M. J. Holmes, she publicly\r\n     assailed the cross examination of women in criminal trials,\r\n     either as culprits or witnesses, until the practice was broken\r\n     up, and private hearings accorded. In 1876 she sent a memorial to\r\n     the National Democratic convention at St. Louis, asking that\r\n     party to declare for woman suffrage in its platform. Though her\r\n     appeal was not read, hundreds of copies were circulated among the\r\n     members in the hope of stirring thought on the subject in the\r\n     South. It provoked much sarcasm because it was signed only by\r\n     Mrs. Meriwether and Mrs. Saxon. In 1880-81 Mrs. Meriwether was\r\n     one of the speakers in the series of conventions held by the\r\n     National association in the Western and New England States.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1870, immediately after the National Washington\r\nconvention, Mrs. Paulina Wright Davis, while spending a few days in\r\nRichmond, formed the acquaintance of Mrs. Anna Whitehead Bodeker, a\r\nmost earnest advocate of the ballot for women. Mrs. Davis held a\r\nparlor meeting in the home of Mrs. Bodeker, enlisting the interest\r\nof several prominent citizens of Richmond, who very soon invited\r\nMrs. Joslyn Gage to their city to give a series of lectures. Of the\r\nresult of this visit we give Mrs. Bodeker's report as published in\r\n_The Revolution_ of May, 1870:\r\n\r\n     DEAR REVOLUTION:--I glory in announcing a grand achievement in\r\n     the great reform of the day in Virginia. Our energetic and heroic\r\n     leader, Mrs. M. Joslyn Gage, after giant efforts on her part, and\r\n     with the aid of some strong advocates of the reform, on Friday\r\n     evening, May 6, 1870, organized in the city of Richmond a\r\n     Virginia State Woman Suffrage Association. The whole proceedings\r\n     I here append, for immediate publication in your columns.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Gage, advisory counsel for New York, in the National Woman\r\n     Suffrage Association of America, delivered a lecture upon\r\n     \"Opportunity for Woman,\" at Bosher's Hall, corner of Ninth and\r\n     Main streets, on Thursday evening. The lecture was able, earnest\r\n     and eloquent, and was listened to with rapt attention by the\r\n     friends of the cause present. At its conclusion, Judge John C.\r\n     Underwood gave notice that on the following evening a meeting\r\n     would be held at the United States Court room (which he freely\r\n     proffered for the purpose) to organize a State Association, adopt\r\n     a constitution, elect officers, and appoint delegates to the\r\n     anniversary of the National Association soon to be held in New\r\n     York city. The judge remarked that, upon conversing with Governor\r\n     Wise upon the subject, he expressed his warm sympathy with the\r\n     objects of the movement save upon the question of giving women\r\n     the ballot. With all the other rights claimed, he was heartily in\r\n     accord; especially, he thought, should the professions be opened\r\n     to women, more particularly the medical, they being the natural\r\n     physicians of their sex and of children.\r\n\r\n     Pursuant to the above notice, a meeting was held in the United\r\n     States court-room. Judge John C. Underwood was called to preside.\r\n     Previous to action on the regular business of the meeting,\r\n     several articles favorable to the movement were read. Miss Sue L.\r\n     F. Smith, daughter of the late Rev. Dr. Wm. A. Smith, read very\r\n     charmingly a well-written essay prepared by herself in advocacy\r\n     of granting to women the full meed of powers and responsibilities\r\n     now enjoyed by men. Mr. William E. Colman read an article\r\n     entitled \"Clerical Denunciation of Woman Suffrage--A Defense,\"\r\n     being a reply to a violent attack made by the Rev. Dr. Edwards of\r\n     this city, upon the adherents of the movement, in a sermon\r\n     delivered by him recently. A proposed constitution for the\r\n     government of the Virginia State Woman Suffrage Association was\r\n     adopted; after which came the election of officers[532] of the\r\n     society. On motion of Judge Underwood, Miss Sue L. F. Smith was\r\n     appointed delegate to represent Virginia in the National\r\n     Association to be held in New York city May 12, 13, the society\r\n     having by resolution connected itself as an auxiliary to said\r\n     National Association. Mrs. Gage offered resolutions, which were\r\n     unanimously adopted, after which she delivered a forcible\r\n     address, enumerating many of the wrongs to which women are\r\n     subjected in this State, dwelling particularly upon the laws\r\n     depriving mothers of the right to their own children, placing the\r\n     property of married women at the mercy of their husbands, and\r\n     depriving the wives of all voice in the disposition of the\r\n     property possessed by them before marriage.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1871, Miss Anthony was honored by an invitation\r\nfrom the society, and held several meetings in Judge Underwood's\r\ncourt-room. About this time appeared the following:\r\n\r\n     Judge Underwood, having stated in a letter that after mature\r\n     consideration he had come to the conclusion that the fourteenth\r\n     and fifteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United\r\n     States, together with the enforcement act of May 31, 1870, have\r\n     secured the right to vote to female citizens as fully as it is\r\n     now exercised and enjoyed by male citizens, a test case is to be\r\n     made at once in the Virginia courts. As there are very few\r\n     advocates of woman suffrage in Virginia, some of the leaders of\r\n     the movement in Washington are about to move to Alexandria to\r\n     perfect an organization and be ready with a case when Judge\r\n     Underwood opens court there.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Bodeker, who also memorialized the general assembly, was\r\nfirst to make the attempt to vote. The Richmond _Dispatch_\r\ndescribes the occasion:\r\n\r\n     Yesterday morning the judges of the second precinct of Marshall\r\n     ward, J. F. Shinberger, esq., presiding, were surprised at the\r\n     appearance of a lady at the polls. She wished to deposit a\r\n     ballot, but as the judges declined to allow this, in view of her\r\n     not having registered, she then asked to be permitted to have a\r\n     paper with the following inscription placed in the ballot-box:\r\n     \"By the Constitution of the United States, I, Anne Whitehead\r\n     Bodeker, have a right to give my vote at this election, and in\r\n     vindication of it drop this note in the ballot-box, November 7,\r\n     1871.\" This paper was taken by the judges, and will be deposited\r\n     with the ballots in the archives of the Hustings court.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable incident in Gen. Grant's administration was Miss\r\nElizabeth VanLew's appointment as postmaster at Richmond. She held\r\nthe office eight years, notwithstanding the persistent opposition\r\nof politicians. The _Ballot-Box_ said:\r\n\r\n     Miss VanLew was postmaster in Richmond under Grant, introducing\r\n     many reforms in the office, but through the envy of men, who were\r\n     voters, she, a non-voter, lost her office, as she had lost wealth\r\n     and friends from her devotion to the Union during the war. Now,\r\n     since its close, she finds not only her former slave men\r\n     permitted to make laws for her, but also those whom she opposed\r\n     when they were seeking their country's life. But women of all\r\n     ranks, white and colored, are awaking to their need of the ballot\r\n     for self-protection.\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia _Press_, edited by J. W. Forney, said:\r\n\r\n     Some covert enemies of the president and the new civil-service\r\n     reform have been spreading a report, through sensational\r\n     specials, that the Richmond post-office is to be given to some\r\n     prominent Virginian of local standing as soon as Miss VanLew's\r\n     commission expires. If there is any post-office in the United\r\n     States in which the whole nation at this time has a special\r\n     interest, it is this one of Richmond which the present incumbent\r\n     holds, as it were, by a national right, and certainly by popular\r\n     acclaim. We have not time in a brief paragraph to tell the\r\n     striking story of what Miss VanLew has done and what she has\r\n     suffered for the country. Her story will pass into standard\r\n     history, however, as sadly illustrative of our times. She herself\r\n     is known and loved wherever the horrors of Libby and Belle Isle\r\n     are mourned and denounced.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--WEST VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nHon. Samuel Young, in a letter to _The Revolution_, dated Senate\r\nChamber, Wheeling, West Virginia, February 22, 1869, writes:\r\n\r\n     In 1867, I introduced a bill in the State Senate, looking to the\r\n     enfranchisement of all women in West Virginia, who can read the\r\n     Declaration of Independence intelligently, and write a legible\r\n     hand, and have actually paid tax the year previous to their\r\n     proposing to vote. But even this guarded bill had no friends but\r\n     myself. * * * I introduced a resolution during the present\r\n     session of our legislature, asking congress to extend the right\r\n     of suffrage to women. Eight out of the twenty-two members of the\r\n     Senate voted for it. This is quite encouraging--advancing from\r\n     one to eight in two years. At this rate of progress, we may\r\n     succeed by next winter. I give the names of those who are in\r\n     favor of and voted for female suffrage in the Senate: Drummond,\r\n     Doolittle, Humphreys, Hoke, Wilson, Workman, Young, and\r\n     Farnsworth, president. The same senators voted to invite Miss\r\n     Anna E. Dickinson to lecture in the state-house during her late\r\n     visit to Wheeling.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--NORTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Mrs. Mary Bayard Clarke of New Berne for the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     Since 1868, when the constitution was changed, a married woman\r\n     has absolute control of all the real estate she possessed before\r\n     marriage or acquired by gift or devise after it, except the power\r\n     to sell without the consent of her husband, who in his turn is\r\n     not at liberty to sell any real estate possessed by him before\r\n     marriage, or acquired after it, without the consent of his wife.\r\n     Should he sell any real estate without the wife's consent, in\r\n     writing, she can, after his death, claim her dower of one-third\r\n     in such real estate. If she owns a farm and her husband manages\r\n     it, she can claim full settlements from him, he having no more\r\n     rights than any other agent whom she may employ. So her property,\r\n     real and personal, is her individual right, with the income\r\n     therefrom. But she cannot contract a debt that is binding on her\r\n     property without the consent of her husband. With his written\r\n     consent, which must be registered in the office of the clerk of\r\n     the county in which she resides, she may become a free-trader\r\n     with all the rights of a man, her husband having no claim to her\r\n     gains and not being responsible for any debt which she may\r\n     contract. By giving this written consent her husband virtually\r\n     places her in the position of an unmarried woman, as far as her\r\n     property is concerned.\r\n\r\n     In 1881, finding that a widow had no right to appoint a guardian\r\n     for her children by \"letters testamentary,\" I, through my son,\r\n     William E. Clarke, who was then senator for this county in our\r\n     State legislature, succeeded in getting this law so changed that\r\n     she now has the same rights as a man. In cases of divorce or\r\n     separation while the children are under age, it is discretionary\r\n     with the judge to give the children to either parent; but public\r\n     sentiment always gives them to the mother while young.\r\n\r\n     As a rule the women of the South are better educated than the\r\n     men, the boys being put to work while the girls are at school.\r\n     The girls are not trained to work in any way, and very few, as\r\n     yet, see the necessity of being regularly trained to do anything\r\n     by which they may make a living except as teachers. Our\r\n     public-school system requires a course through the normal school\r\n     for all teachers. Mixed schools are not popular with us, but we\r\n     have been forced into them by the public-graded-school tax, which\r\n     has crushed out our private schools. I am now, and have been for\r\n     the past two years, making an effort to have women on our\r\n     school-boards, and a female as well as a male principal for every\r\n     mixed public school, on the ground that mothers have as much\r\n     right to a voice in the education of their daughters as fathers\r\n     have in that of their sons. We have female teachers in our public\r\n     schools but not as principals, and the pay of the women is,\r\n     regardless of the quality of their work, always considerably less\r\n     than that of men.\r\n\r\n     Our Supreme Court granted a license to Miss Tabitha A. Holton to\r\n     practice law, and there is no legal impediment in the way of one\r\n     doing so. The same is true of the medical profession. Dr. Susan\r\n     Dimock was a North Carolinian by birth and on her application\r\n     for admission to the State Medical Society was unanimously\r\n     elected a member of that body. The African Methodist-Episcopal\r\n     Conference, Bishop Turner presiding, ordained Miss Sarah A.\r\n     Hughes of Raleigh, a bright mulatto girl, as deacon in the\r\n     church. Shortly after the close of the late war, my husband being\r\n     then incapacitated for work by wounds received in the Mexican and\r\n     the civil war, and my sons under age, I applied to Governor\r\n     Jonathan Worth for the position of State librarian. Though\r\n     cordially acknowledging my fitness, intellectually, for the\r\n     office, and admitting that my sex did not legally disqualify me\r\n     to hold it, he positively refused to appoint me or any other\r\n     woman to any office in his gift. Public sentiment then sustained\r\n     him, but it would not now do so; so many ladies of culture,\r\n     refinement and social position have been, since the war, forced\r\n     to work or starve, that it is now nothing remarkable to see them\r\n     and their daughters doing work which twenty years ago they would\r\n     have been ostracised for undertaking.\r\n\r\n     In a letter to the Boston _Index_, published August, 1885, the\r\n     venerable Mrs. Elizabeth Oakes Smith, who is now a resident of\r\n     this State, truthfully says,\r\n\r\n          The women of the North can have little conception of the\r\n          hindrances which their sisters of the South encounter in\r\n          their efforts to accept new and progressive ideas. The other\r\n          sex, in a blind sort of way, hold fast to an absolute kind\r\n          of chivalry akin to that of the renowned Don Quixote, by\r\n          which they try to hold women in the background as a kind of\r\n          porcelain liable to crack and breakage unless daintily\r\n          handled. Women here see the spirit of the age and the need\r\n          of change far more clearly than the men, and act up to this\r\n          light, but with a flexible grace that disarms opposition.\r\n          They see the necessity of work and are turning their\r\n          attention to methods for remunerative labor, far more\r\n          difficult to obtain at the South than at the North.\r\n\r\n     I cordially endorse this extract. The Southern man does not wish\r\n     his \"women folks\" to be self-supporting, not because he is\r\n     jealous of their rivaling him, but because he feels it is his\r\n     duty to be the bread-winner. But the much sneered at \"chivalry\"\r\n     of the South, while rendering it harder for a woman to break\r\n     through old customs, most cordially and heartily sustains her\r\n     when she has successfully done so. There are fewer large centers\r\n     in the South than in the North, and much less attrition of mind\r\n     against mind; the people are homogeneous and slower to change,\r\n     and public opinion is much less fluctuating. But once let the\r\n     tide of woman suffrage fairly turn, and I believe it will be\r\n     irresistable and advance far more steadily and rapidly in the\r\n     South than it has done in the North. Let the Southern women be\r\n     won over and the cause will have nothing to fear from the\r\n     opposition of the men. But, after twenty years' experience as a\r\n     journalist, my honest opinion is that until the Southern women\r\n     can be made to feel the pecuniary advantages to them of suffrage,\r\n     they will not lift a finger or speak a word to obtain it.\r\n\r\n     In 1881, at the March meeting of the Raleigh Typographical Union,\r\n     No. 194, my son, being then a member of that Union, introduced\r\n     and, after some hard fighting, succeeded in carrying a resolution\r\n     placing women compositors on a par in every respect with men.\r\n     There was not at that time a single woman compositor in the\r\n     State, to my son's knowledge; there is one now in Raleigh and two\r\n     apprentices, who claimed and receive all the advantages that men\r\n     applying for admission to the Union receive.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. C. Harris started the _South Atlantic_ at Wilmington. The\r\n     Misses Bernheim and their father started a magazine in the same\r\n     city called _At Home and Abroad_, which was afterwards moved to\r\n     Charlotte; both were short-lived. We have now the _Southern\r\n     Woman_. This is the only journal ever edited and managed by a\r\n     woman alone, with no man associated with or responsible for it. I\r\n     have been for twenty years connected with the press of this State\r\n     in one way and another, and am called the \"Grandmother of the\r\n     North Carolina Press Association.\" In 1880 I delivered an\r\n     original poem before the association, and another Masonic one\r\n     before the board of the orphan asylum; making me, I believe, the\r\n     first native North Carolina woman that ever came before the\r\n     public as a speaker. I was both denounced and applauded for my\r\n     \"brass\" and \"bravery.\" Public sentiment has changed since then.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Marion A. Williams, president of the State National Bank at\r\n     Raleigh for several years, is probably the first woman ever\r\n     elected to that responsible position in any State of this Union.\r\n     In 1885 Louisa B. Stephens was made president of the First\r\n     National Bank of Marion, Iowa; and a national bank in Newbery,\r\n     South Carolina, honored itself by placing a woman at the head of\r\n     its official board.\r\n\r\n     The _North Carolinian_ of January, 1870, contained an able\r\n     editorial endorsing woman suffrage, closing with:\r\n\r\n          For one we say, tear down the barriers, give woman an\r\n          opportunity to show her wisdom and virtue; place the ballot\r\n          in her hands that she may protect herself and reform men,\r\n          and ere a quarter of a century has elapsed many of the\r\n          foulest blots upon the civilization of this age will have\r\n          passed away.\r\n\r\nFrom an interesting article in the _Boston Advertiser_, May 22,\r\n1875, by Rev. James Freeman Clark, concerning Dr. Susan Dimock, one\r\nof North Carolina's promising daughters, whose career was ended in\r\nthe wreck of the Schiller near the Scilly islands, we make a few\r\nextracts:\r\n\r\n     One of our eminent surgeons, Dr. Samuel Cabot, said to me\r\n     yesterday:\r\n\r\n          \"This community will never know what a loss it has had in\r\n          Dr. Dimock. It was not merely her skill, though that was\r\n          remarkable, considering her youth and limited experience,\r\n          but also her nerve, that qualified her to become a great\r\n          surgeon. I have seldom known one at once so determined and\r\n          so self-possessed. Skill is a quality much more easily found\r\n          than this self-control that nothing can flurry. She had that\r\n          in an eminent degree; and, had she lived, she would have\r\n          been sure to stand, in time, among those at the head of her\r\n          profession. The usual weapons of ridicule would have been\r\n          impotent against a woman who had reached that supreme\r\n          position which Susan Dimock would certainly have attained.\"\r\n\r\n     During the war of the rebellion, Miss Dimock sought admission\r\n     into the medical school of Harvard University, preferring, if\r\n     possible, to take a degree in an American college. Twice she\r\n     applied, and was twice refused. Hearing that the University of\r\n     Zurich was open to women, she went there, and was received with a\r\n     hospitality which the institutions of her own country did not\r\n     offer. She pursued her medical studies there, and graduated with\r\n     honor. A number of the \"Revue des Deux Mondes\" for August, 1872,\r\n     contains an article called \"Les Femmes a l'Universitie de\r\n     Zurich,\" which speaks very favorably of the success of the women\r\n     in that place. The first to take a degree as doctor of medicine\r\n     was a young Russian lady, in 1867. Between 1867 and 1872 five\r\n     others had taken this degree, and among them Miss Dimock is\r\n     mentioned. From the medical school at Zurich, she went to that at\r\n     Vienna; and of her appearance there we have this record: A\r\n     distinguished German physician remarked to a friend of mine\r\n     residing in Germany that he had always been opposed to women as\r\n     physicians--but that he had met a young American lady studying at\r\n     Vienna, whose intelligence, modesty and devotion to her work was\r\n     such as almost to convince him that he was wrong. A comparison of\r\n     dates shows that this American student must have been Dr. Dimock.\r\n\r\n     On her return to the United States Dr. Dimock became resident\r\n     physician at \"The Hospital for Women and Children,\" on Codman\r\n     Avenue, in Boston. Both the students of medicine and the patients\r\n     became devotedly attached to her; they were fascinated by this\r\n     remarkable union of tenderness, firmness and skill. The secret\r\n     was in part told by what she said in one of her lectures in the\r\n     training-school for nurses connected with the woman's hospital:\r\n     \"I wish you, of all my instructions, especially to remember this.\r\n     Where you go to nurse a patient, imagine that it is your own\r\n     sister before you in that bed; and treat her as you would wish\r\n     your own sister to be treated.\" While at this hospital, she was\r\n     also able to carry out a principle in which she firmly believed,\r\n     namely--that in a hospital the rights of every patient, poor and\r\n     rich, should be sacredly regarded, and never be postponed even to\r\n     the supposed interests of medical students. No student was\r\n     allowed to be present at any operation, except so far as the\r\n     comfort and safety of her patients rendered the student's\r\n     presence desirable. Her interest in the woman's hospital was\r\n     very great. She was in the habit, at the beginning of each year,\r\n     of writing and sealing up her wishes for the coming year. Since\r\n     her death, her mother has opened the envelope of January 1, 1875,\r\n     and found it to contain a prayer for a blessing on \"my dear\r\n     hospital.\"\r\n\r\n     And now this young, strong soul so ardent in the pursuit of\r\n     knowledge, so filled with a desire to help her suffering sisters,\r\n     has been taken by that remorseless deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--SOUTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\nThe first action we hear of in South Carolina was a Woman's Right's\r\nConvention in Columbia, Dec. 20, 1870, of which the Charleston\r\n_Republican_ said:\r\n\r\n     The chairman, Miss Rollin, said: \"It had been so universally the\r\n     custom to treat the idea of woman suffrage with ridicule and\r\n     merriment that it becomes necessary in submitting the subject for\r\n     earnest deliberation that we assure the gentlemen present that\r\n     our claim is made honestly and seriously. We ask suffrage not as\r\n     a favor, not as a privilege, but as a right based on the ground\r\n     that we are human beings, and as such, entitled to all human\r\n     rights. While we concede that woman's ennobling influence should\r\n     be confined chiefly to home and society, we claim that public\r\n     opinion has had a tendency to limit woman's sphere to too small a\r\n     circle, and until woman has the right of representation this will\r\n     last, and other rights will be held by an insecure tenure.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. T. J. Mackey made a forcible argument in favor of the\r\n     movement. He was followed by Miss Hosley, who made a few brief\r\n     remarks upon the subject. General Moses thought woman's\r\n     introduction upon the political platform would benefit us much in\r\n     a moral point of view, and that they had a right to assist in\r\n     making the laws that govern them as well as the sterner sex.\r\n     Messrs. Cardozo, Pioneer and Rev. Mr. Harris followed in short\r\n     speeches, endorsing the movement and wishing it success.\r\n     Resolutions were adopted, and officers chosen.[533] The following\r\n     letters were read:\r\n\r\n                         EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, Columbia, Jan. 19, 1871.\r\n\r\n          _Miss L. M. Rollin_:--I have the honor to acknowledge the\r\n          receipt of your invitation to be present at the preliminary\r\n          organization of the association for the assertion of woman's\r\n          rights in this State, and regret that the pressure of public\r\n          duties precludes my indulging myself in that pleasure. Be\r\n          assured, however, that the cause has my warmest sympathy,\r\n          and I indulge the hope that the time is not far distant when\r\n          woman shall be the peer of man in political rights, as she\r\n          is peerless in all others, and when she will be able to\r\n          reclaim some of those privileges that are now monopolized by\r\n          the sterner sex.\r\n\r\n          I have the honor to be, very respectfully, etc.,\r\n\r\n                                              R. K. SCOTT, _Governor_.\r\n\r\n               OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, Columbia, Feb. 1, 1871.\r\n\r\n          I hoped when I received your invitation to the meeting\r\n          to-night of the friends of woman suffrage, that I should be\r\n          able to attend in person, but at a late hour I find other\r\n          duties standing in the way, and I can only say a word of\r\n          approval and encouragement with my pen. The woman suffrage\r\n          cause is to my mind so just and so expedient as to need\r\n          little argument. To say that my mother, my sisters or my\r\n          wife have less interest in good government than I have, or\r\n          are less fitted by nature to understand and use the ballot\r\n          than I am, is to contradict reason and fact.\r\n\r\n          Upon the same grounds that I defend my own right to share in\r\n          the government which controls and protects me, do I now\r\n          assert the right of woman to a voice in public affairs. For\r\n          the same reasons that I would regard an attempt to rob me of\r\n          my civil rights as tyranny, do I now protest against the\r\n          continued civil inequality and thralldom of woman. I take no\r\n          merit or pride to myself for such a position. I have felt\r\n          and said these things during my whole life. They are to me\r\n          self-evident truths; needing no more demonstration by\r\n          argument than the first lines of the Declaration of American\r\n          Independence. My claim for woman is simply this: Give her a\r\n          full and fair chance to act in any sphere for which she can\r\n          fit herself. Her sphere is as wide as man's. It has no\r\n          limits except her capacity. If woman cannot perform a\r\n          soldier's duty, then the army is not her sphere; if she can,\r\n          it is her sphere, as much as it is man's.\r\n\r\n          I value the ballot for woman chiefly because it opens to her\r\n          a wide, free avenue to a complete development of all her\r\n          powers. The Chinese lady's shoe is nothing compared to the\r\n          clamps and fetters which we Americans have put upon woman's\r\n          mind and soul. An impartial observer would scarcely condemn\r\n          the one and approve the other. What we need now is to\r\n          accustom the public to these radical truths. Demand the\r\n          ballot; demand woman's freedom. It is not a conflict of\r\n          argument or reason, so much as a crusade against habit and\r\n          prejudice. To tell the truth, I don't think there is a\r\n          respectable argument in the world against woman suffrage.\r\n          People think they are arguing or reasoning against it when\r\n          they are in fact only repeating the prejudices in which they\r\n          have been trained. With the sincerest wishes for the success\r\n          of your meeting and of all your efforts for woman suffrage,\r\n          I remain, yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                             D. H. CHAMBERLAIN.\r\n\r\nThe American association memorialized the legislature March 13,\r\n1872. The joint committee recommended an amendment to the\r\nconstitution of the State, providing that every person, male or\r\nfemale, possessed of the necessary qualifications, should be\r\nentitled to vote. B. F. Whittemore, H. J. Maxwell, W. B. Nash, G.\r\nF. McIntyre, were the committee on the part of the Senate; C. D.\r\nHayne, W. J. Whipper, Benj. Byas, B. G. Yocom, F. H. Frost,\r\ncommittee on the part of the House.\r\n\r\nIn the debate in congress in 1874, Hon. Alonzo J. Ransier of South\r\nCarolina, the civil-rights bill being under discussion, claimed\r\nthat equal human rights should be extended to women as follows:\r\n\r\n     And may the day be not far distant when American citizenship in\r\n     civil and political rights and public privileges shall cover not\r\n     only those of our sex, but those of the opposite one also; until\r\n     which time the government of the United States cannot be said to\r\n     rest upon the \"consent of the governed,\" or to adequately protect\r\n     them in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\nMiss Sallie R. Banks, for some years a teacher of colored schools\r\nin South Carolina, has been appointed collector of internal revenue\r\nfor the Sumter district.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--FLORIDA.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, the agricultural department at Washington, paid a premium\r\nof $12 to Madame Atzeroth of Manatee, for the first pound of coffee\r\never grown out of doors in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe following is from a letter to the Savannah _News_, reporting a\r\njudgment rendered by a Florida county judge, in a case between an\r\nold black man and his wife:\r\n\r\n                                   OCALA, Fla., May 12, 1874.\r\n\r\n     Be it known throughout all christendom that the husband is the\r\n     head of the wife, and whatever is his is his'n, and whatever is\r\n     hers is his'n, and come weal or woe, peace or war, the right of\r\n     all property is vested in the husband, and the wife must not take\r\n     anything away. The ox belongs to Uncle Ben, and he must keep it,\r\n     and the other things, and if the old woman quits she must go\r\n     empty-handed. Know all that this is so by order of the Judge of\r\n     Probate.\r\n\r\n                                   [Signed]      WM. R. HILLYER.\r\n\r\nThough quaintly expressed, yet this decision is in line with the\r\nold common law and the statutes of many of the States in this Union\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.--ALABAMA.\r\n\r\nThe women of Alabama are evidently awake on the temperance\r\nquestion, though still apparently unprepared for suffrage. In a\r\nreport of a meeting in Birmingham in 1885, the following, from a\r\nprominent editor, was read by the president:\r\n\r\n     Tell the admirable lady, Mrs. Bryce, that I would devote\r\n     everything to the cause she espouses, but there's no use. Let\r\n     women demand the ballot, and with it they can destroy whisky, and\r\n     by no other agency. There is no perfect family or state in which\r\n     woman is not an active governing force. They should have the\r\n     courage to assert themselves and then they can serve the country\r\n     and the race.\r\n\r\nIf a thunderbolt had fallen it would not have created a greater\r\nsensation. The ladies at first grew indignant and uttered\r\nprotestations. When they grew calmer, the corresponding secretary\r\nwas ordered to furnish the editor with the following:\r\n\r\n     The ladies of the W. C. T. U. return thanks to the editor for his\r\n     kindly and progressive suggestions, but, in their opinion, they\r\n     are not ready to ask any political favors. Whenever suffrage is\r\n     granted to the women of the United States, those of Alabama will\r\n     be found on the right side.\r\n\r\nAt Huntsville lives Mrs. Priscilla Holmes Drake, whose name has\r\nstood as representative of our National Association in Alabama\r\nsince 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.--GEORGIA.\r\n\r\nWe give a letter from Georgia's great statesman, defining his views\r\nof woman's sphere:\r\n\r\n          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, WASHINGTON, D. C., May 29, 1878.\r\n\r\n     _Mrs. E. L. Saxon, New Orleans, La._\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MADAM:--Your letter to Hon. Alexander H. Stephens, of the\r\n     22d inst., came duly to hand. He requests me to thank you for it,\r\n     and to say in reply that he has ever sympathized with woman in\r\n     her efforts for a higher and broader sphere of intellectual and\r\n     moral culture, as well as physical usefulness in life. He does\r\n     not go so far as to endow woman with the ballot, or to fit her\r\n     for the more masculine duties of the State. Her sphere, by\r\n     nature, is circumscribed within certain physical boundaries, but\r\n     in all those things to which she is fitted by nature, and can\r\n     enter without interference with the laws of God, he would open\r\n     the doors wide to her.\r\n\r\n               Very respectfully yours,     C. P. CULVER, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[523] Myrtilla Miner; published by Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Boston\r\nand New York.\r\n\r\n[524] See Vol. II., page 90.\r\n\r\n[525] _President_, Hon.

(CONCLUDED).\r\n\r\nCANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Miss Phelps of St. Catharines and Mrs. Curzon of\r\nToronto for the facts we give in regard to women's position in the\r\nDominion. Miss Phelps says:\r\n\r\n     History tells us that when the thirteen American colonies\r\n     revolted and their independence was declared there were 25,000\r\n     who adhered to the policy of King George, under the name of the\r\n     United Empire Loyalists, some of whom came to Canada, others to\r\n     Acadia and others wandered elsewhere. The 10,000 who sought a\r\n     home in Canada at once formed a government in harmony with\r\n     English laws and usages. Parliament was established in 1803 at\r\n     York, now Toronto, and during that session the first law for the\r\n     protection of married women was passed. At first, if a married\r\n     woman desired to dispose of her property, she was obliged to go\r\n     before the courts to testify as to her willingness to do so. In\r\n     1821 a bill was passed enabling her to go before justices of the\r\n     peace. This was a great convenience, for the courts were not\r\n     always in session when it was imperative for her to sell. In 1849\r\n     a bill was passed to naturalize women who married native-born or\r\n     naturalized subjects. In 1859, under the old parliament of\r\n     Canada, the Married Woman's Property act was passed, which in\r\n     brief provides that every woman who may marry without any\r\n     marriage-contract or settlement shall, after May 4, 1859,\r\n     notwithstanding her coverture, have, hold and enjoy all her real\r\n     estate, whether belonging to her before marriage or in any way\r\n     acquired afterward, free from her husband's debts and obligations\r\n     contracted after May 4, 1859. A married woman may also hold her\r\n     personal property free from the debts and contracts of her\r\n     husband, and obtain an order of protection for her own earnings\r\n     and those of her minor children. She may become a stockholder of\r\n     any bank, insurance company or any incorporated association, as\r\n     if she were a _feme sole_, and may vote by proxy or otherwise. A\r\n     married woman is liable on contracts respecting her own real\r\n     estate. No married woman is liable to arrest either on mesne or\r\n     final process. Any superior court of law or equity or any judge\r\n     of said court, or a judge of a surrogate court, or deputy, may,\r\n     on hearing the petition of a mother, or minor whose father is\r\n     dead, appoint her as guardian--notwithstanding the appointment of\r\n     another person by the father--of the estate to which the minor is\r\n     entitled, and of such sums of money as are necessary from time to\r\n     time for the maintenance of the minor. In 1881 a law was passed\r\n     enabling a woman to discharge a mortgage on her lands without her\r\n     husband being a party to it, while a husband cannot dispose of\r\n     his property without her consent.\r\n\r\n     More than thirty years ago school suffrage was granted to women\r\n     on the same grounds as to male electors, and they are eligible to\r\n     all school offices. Women have, however, been slow to avail\r\n     themselves of this privilege, owing to their ignorance of the\r\n     laws and their lack of interest in regard to all public measures.\r\n     When they awake to their political rights they will feel a deeper\r\n     responsibility in the discharge of their public duties. But the\r\n     steady increase in the number of those who avail themselves of\r\n     this privilege is the one encouraging indication of the growth of\r\n     the suffrage movement in Canada.\r\n\r\n     In 1882 the municipal act was so amended as to give married\r\n     women, widows and spinsters, if possessed of the necessary\r\n     qualifications, the right to vote on by-laws and some other minor\r\n     municipal matters. Again, in 1884, the act was still further\r\n     amended, extending the right to vote at municipal elections to\r\n     widows and unmarried women on all matters. In Toronto, January 4,\r\n     1886, the women polled a large vote, resulting in the election of\r\n     the candidate pledged to reform. But it must be remembered that\r\n     this progressive legislation belongs only to the Province of\r\n     Ontario.\r\n\r\nMrs. Curzon writes:\r\n\r\n     In the year 1876 Dr. Emily H. Stowe--graduated in New\r\n     York--settled in Toronto for the practice of her profession.\r\n     Thoroughly imbued with the principles roughly summed up in the\r\n     term \"woman's rights,\" and finding that her native Canada was not\r\n     awake to the importance of the subject, she lectured in the\r\n     principal towns of Ontario on \"Woman's Sphere and Woman in\r\n     Medicine.\" By reason of the agitation caused by these lectures a\r\n     Woman's Literary Club[534] was organized in Toronto with Dr.\r\n     Stowe, president, and Miss Helen Archibald, secretary. The\r\n     triumphs scored through the efforts of this club were the\r\n     admission of women to the University College and School of\r\n     Medicine of Toronto, Queen's University and the Royal Medical\r\n     School of Kingston, and the founding of a medical school for\r\n     women in each city. When the municipal franchise was granted to\r\n     women the club decided to come out boldly as a suffrage\r\n     organization. Accordingly by resolution the Toronto Woman's\r\n     Literary Club was dissolved and the Canadian Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association[535] formed, March 9, 1883.\r\n\r\n     McGill University at Montreal has an annex for women founded\r\n     through the munificence of one of the merchants of that\r\n     city.----Dalhousie College, Halifax, admits women on the same\r\n     footing as men. The Toronto _Mail_ says it is only a question of\r\n     time when all Canadian colleges will do the same thing.----In\r\n     1883 the provincial legislature of Nova Scotia gave duly\r\n     qualified women the right to vote, and they exercised it very\r\n     generally the following year.----In New Brunswick the old laws\r\n     and prejudices remain, but woman suffrage has its friends and\r\n     advocates in Mrs. E. W. Fisher and Mr. and Mrs. W. Frank Hathaway\r\n     of St. Johns.----In 1885 the Mount Allison Methodist College at\r\n     Sackville, N. B., conferred the degree of M. A. on Miss Harriet\r\n     Stewart. This is the first instance of an educational institution\r\n     in the Dominion conferring such an honor upon a lady.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[534] _The Ballot-Box_ in 1880 said: \"_The Citizen_ of Toronto,\r\nOnt., has established a 'Ladies' Column' under the auspices of the\r\nToronto Woman's Literary Club, the first ladies' club ever formed\r\nin Canada. This club has been in existence four years. _The\r\nCitizen_ is said to be the first Canadian paper devoted, even in\r\npart, to woman's interest. Heading this change 'Important Notice,'\r\nit says: 'We have great pleasure in announcing that we have made an\r\narrangement with the Toronto Woman's Literary Club to occupy an\r\nimportant space in our columns, for the advance of moral, social,\r\neducational and family matters affecting woman generally. Mrs. S.\r\nA. Curzon has charge of this column as associate editor.' The club\r\nin a stirring salutatory defines its work and objects. It is the\r\nintention to give, each week, a _resume_ of the current topics\r\nconcerning women, education, the franchises, the legal abilities\r\nand disabilities of women, etc., hoping to arouse a national\r\nsentiment among Canadian women and intelligence upon these\r\nimportant subjects. This appeal is signed by Mrs. McEwen, the\r\npresident, and Emily H. Stowe, Mrs. W. J. MacKenzie, Mrs. W. B.\r\nHamilton and Mrs. S. A. Curzon, the executive committee.\"\r\n\r\n[535] The officers were: _President_, Mrs. Donald McEwen;\r\n_Vice-Presidents_, Mrs. Curzon, Mrs. E. H. Stowe, M. D., Captain W.\r\nF.

As a nation we are fond of\r\nworking by precedents, and it is a favorite saying among lawyers\r\nthat modern English law began with Henry III. In earlier Saxon\r\ntimes women who were freeholders of lands or burgesses in towns had\r\nthe same electoral rights as men. We have records of the reigns of\r\nMary and Elizabeth, showing that ladies of the manse, in their own\r\nright, sent members to parliament. Down to the time of the civil\r\nwars women were accustomed to share in the election of \"parliament\r\nmen.\" In 1640, some women voted in an election for the county of\r\nSuffolk, Sir Simonds d'Ewes being high-sheriff:\r\n\r\n     Who, as soon as he had notice thereof, sent to forbid the same,\r\n     conceiving it a matter verie unworthy of anie gentleman, and most\r\n     dishonourable in such an election to make use of their voices,\r\n     although in law they might have been allowed.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the Puritans was not favorable to woman's equality;\r\nbut, though disused, the right was never absolutely taken away by\r\nlaw. In a celebrated trial, Olive _vs._ Ingram (reign of George\r\nII.) the chief-justice gave it as his opinion that \"a person paying\r\nscot and lot,\" and therefore qualified to vote, was a description\r\nwhich included women; and all the writs of election down to the\r\ntime of William IV. were made to \"persons\" who were freeholders.\r\nHowever, for all purposes of political life this right was as good\r\nas dead, being absolutely forgotten. But still the local franchises\r\nremained. We have no data to determine whether these were as\r\ncompletely neglected as the parliamentary franchise. Parishioners\r\nvoted for overseers of the poor and for other local boards; and\r\nwomen were never legally disqualified from voting in these\r\nelections. The lowest period in the condition of women appears to\r\nhave been reached at the end of the last century, though they were\r\nnot then indifferent to politics. \"You cannot,\" says Miss\r\nEdgeworth's Lady Davenant, \"satisfy yourself with the common\r\nnamby-pamby phrase, 'Ladies have nothing to do with politics.' * *\r\n* Female influence must exist on political subjects as well as on\r\nall others; but this influence should always be domestic not\r\npublic; the customs of society have so ruled it.\" This sentence\r\nexactly represented ordinary English feeling. It was never\r\nconsidered derogatory to an English lady to take an active part in\r\nelections, provided she did so for some member of her family; but\r\nof direct responsibility she had none.\r\n\r\nIn the ferment of opinion which preceded the great Reform bill,\r\nwoman's claim to participate in it was never heard. The new\r\nfranchises which were then for the first time created applied\r\nexclusively to _male_ persons, but in the old franchises continuing\r\nin force, the word \"person\" alone is strictly used. Mr. Sidney\r\nSmith said:\r\n\r\n     In reserving and keeping alive the qualifications in existence\r\n     before those itself created, this statute falls back exactly to\r\n     the accustomed phraseology of the earlier acts. Whenever it\r\n     confers a new right it restricts it to every male person.\r\n     Whenever it perpetuates existing franchises, it continues them\r\n     to every person, leaving the word \"male\" out on system.\r\n\r\nThis may have been little more than an oversight, or it may have\r\nbeen that respect for precedent which used to be an inherent\r\nquality in English statesmen. But it is curious that the first\r\npetition ever, to our knowledge, presented for women's suffrage to\r\nthe House of Commons should date from this same year. It was\r\npresented on August 3, 1832, and is the worthy predecessor of many\r\nthousands in later times. Hansard thus describes it:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Hunt said he had a petition to present which might be a\r\n     subject of mirth to some honorable gentlemen, but which was one\r\n     deserving of consideration. It came from a lady of rank and\r\n     fortune, Mary Smith of Stanmore, in the county of York. The\r\n     petition stated that she paid taxes, and therefore did not see\r\n     why she should not have a share in the election of a\r\n     representative; she also stated that women were liable to all the\r\n     penalties of the law, even death, and ought to have a voice in\r\n     the fixing of them; but so far from this, on their trials both\r\n     judges and jurors were of the opposite sex. She could see no good\r\n     reason for the exclusion of women from political rights while the\r\n     highest office of the State, that of the crown, was open to the\r\n     inheritance of females; and, so we understood, the petitioner\r\n     expressed her indignation against those vile wretches who would\r\n     not marry, and yet would exclude females from a share in the\r\n     legislation. The prayer of the petition was that every unmarried\r\n     female, possessing the necessary pecuniary qualifications, should\r\n     be entitled to vote for members of parliament.\r\n\r\nThe following year Sir Robert Peel in opposing vote by ballot said:\r\n\r\n     The theoretical arguments in favor of woman suffrage were at\r\n     least as strong as those in favor of vote by ballot. There were\r\n     arguments in favor of extending the franchise to women to which\r\n     it was no easy matter to find a logical answer. Other and more\r\n     important duties were entrusted to women. Women were allowed to\r\n     hold property, to vote on many occasions in right of that\r\n     property; nay, a woman might inherit the throne and perform all\r\n     the functions of the first office of the State. Why should they\r\n     not vote for a member of parliament?\r\n\r\nBut Sir Robert Peel evidently had no idea that a time would come\r\nwhen women would ask this question in downright seriousness.\r\nMeanwhile the preference for the words \"male person\" in the new\r\nenactments still continued. It was employed in the Municipal\r\nCorporation Reform act, 1835; and in the Irish poor-law act of\r\n1838, women, as well as clergymen, were expressly excluded from\r\nelection as poor-law guardians. The repeal of the corn-laws brought\r\nthe political work of women to the front; they formed local\r\ncommittees, collected funds and attended meetings. In a speech on\r\nfree-trade, delivered in Covent Garden Theater January 15, 1845,\r\nRichard Cobden said:\r\n\r\n     There are many ladies present, I am happy to say; now, it is a\r\n     very anomalous fact that they cannot vote themselves, and yet\r\n     that they have a power of conferring votes upon other people. I\r\n     wish they had the franchise, for they would often make much\r\n     better use of it than their husbands.\r\n\r\nAgain in 1848, in supporting a motion of Mr. Joseph Hume in the\r\nHouse of Commons to the effect that the elective franchise should\r\nbe extended to all householders, Mr. Cobden said:\r\n\r\n     A gentleman asked me to support universal suffrage on the ground\r\n     of principle, and I said to him, if it is a principle that a man\r\n     should have a vote because he pays taxes, why should not a widow\r\n     who pays taxes and is liable to serve as church-warden and\r\n     overseer, have a vote for members of parliament? The gentleman\r\n     replied that he agreed with me.\r\n\r\nIn 1853, Mr. W. J. Fox, member for Oldham, in acknowledging the\r\npresentation to him by the ladies of Oldham of a signet-ring\r\nbearing the inscription, \"Education, the birthright of all,\" spoke\r\nstrongly in favor of women having a definite share in political\r\nlife:\r\n\r\n     If women have nothing to do with politics, honest men ought to\r\n     have nothing to do with politics. They keep us pure, simple,\r\n     just, earnest, in our exertions in politics and public life. They\r\n     have to do with it, because while the portion of man may be by\r\n     the rougher labors of the head and hands to work out many of the\r\n     great results of life, the peculiar function of woman is to\r\n     spread grace and softness, truth, beauty, benignity over all. Nor\r\n     is woman confined to this. In fact I wish that her direct as well\r\n     as indirect influence were still larger than it is in the sphere\r\n     of politics. Why, we trust a woman with the sceptre of the realm,\r\n     consider her adequate to make peers in the State and bishops in\r\n     the Church; surely she must be adequate to send her\r\n     representatives to the lower House. I know the time may not have\r\n     come for mooting a question of this sort; but I know the time\r\n     will come, and that woman will be something more than a mere\r\n     adjective to man in political matters. She will become a\r\n     substantive also. And why not?\r\n\r\nOther speakers and writers brought forward the same point. Jeremy\r\nBentham declared he could find no reasons for the exclusion of\r\nwomen, though he laid no stress on the matter; Herbert Spencer in\r\n\"Social Statics\" (1851), Mr. Thomas Hare in his book on\r\n\"Representation,\" and Mr. Mill in \"Representative Government,\" all\r\ndiscussed it. In 1843 Mrs. Hugo Reid published an excellent volume,\r\n\"A Plea for Woman,\" in which she maintained that \"There is no good\r\nground for the assumption that the possession and exercise of\r\npolitical privileges are incompatible with home duties.\" In 1841 a\r\nstrong article appeared in the _Westminster Review_, written by\r\nMrs. Margaret Mylne, a Scotch lady still living. Mrs. Stuart Mill's\r\nadmirably comprehensive article appeared in the same review in\r\n1851.[536] In 1846, also, Col. T. Perronet Thompson, the well-known\r\nanti-corn-law advocate, wrote:\r\n\r\n     Whenever the popular party can agree upon and bring forward any\r\n     plan which shall include the equal voting of women, they will not\r\n     only obtain an alliance of which most men know the importance,\r\n     but they will relieve the theory of universal suffrage from the\r\n     stigma its enemies never fail to draw upon it, of making its\r\n     first step a wholesale disqualification of half the universe\r\n     concerned.\r\n\r\nAmong other writers and speakers on the subject, we must also\r\nenumerate Anne Knight, an earnest warm-hearted Quaker lady. She\r\nsometimes lectured upon it, and many of her letters written to Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Pease Nichol of Edinburgh, Lord Brougham, and others, are\r\nstill preserved, in which she eagerly advocates the admission of\r\nwomen to the suffrage. She assisted in founding the Sheffield\r\nFemale Political Association. On February 26, 1851, this\r\nassociation held a meeting at the Democratic Temperance Hotel,\r\nSheffield, and unanimously adopted an address, which was the first\r\nmanifesto dealing with the suffrage ever formulated by a meeting of\r\nwomen in England:\r\n\r\n     ADDRESS OF THE SHEFFIELD POLITICAL ASSOCIATION TO THE WOMEN OF\r\n     ENGLAND--_Beloved Sisters_: We, the women of the democracy of\r\n     Sheffield, beg the indulgence of addressing you at this important\r\n     juncture. We have been observers for a number of years of the\r\n     various plans and systems of organization which have been laid\r\n     down for the better government and guidance of democracy, and we\r\n     are brought to the conclusion that women might with the strictest\r\n     propriety be included in the proclamation of the people's\r\n     charter; for we are the majority of the nation, and it is our\r\n     birth-right, equally with our brother, to vote for the man who is\r\n     to sway our political destiny, to impose the taxes which we are\r\n     compelled to pay, to make the laws which we with others must\r\n     observe; and heartily should we rejoice to see the women of\r\n     England uniting for the purpose of demanding this great right of\r\n     humanity, feeling assured that were women thus comprehended, they\r\n     would be the greatest auxiliaries of right against might. For\r\n     what would not the patient, energetic mind of woman accomplish,\r\n     when once resolved? The brave and heroic deeds which history\r\n     records are our testimony that no danger is too great, no\r\n     struggle too arduous for her to encounter; thus confirming our\r\n     convictions that woman's cooeperation is greatly needed for the\r\n     accomplishment of our political well-being. But there are some\r\n     who would say: \"Would you have woman enjoy all the political\r\n     rights of men?\" To this we emphatically answer: Yes! for does she\r\n     not toil early and late in the factory, and in every department\r\n     of life subject to the despotism of men? and we ask in the name\r\n     of justice, must we continue ever the silent and servile victims\r\n     of this injustice? perform all the drudgery of his political\r\n     societies and never possess a single political right? Is the\r\n     oppression to last forever? We, the women of the democracy of\r\n     Sheffield, answer, No! We put forth this earnest appeal to our\r\n     sisters of England to join hand and heart with us in this noble\r\n     and just cause, to the exposing and eradicating of such a state\r\n     of things. Let us shake off our apathy and raise our voices for\r\n     right and liberty, till justice in all its fulness is conceded to\r\n     us. This we say to all who are contending for liberty, for what\r\n     is liberty if the claims of women be disregarded? Our special\r\n     object will be the entire political enfranchisement of our own\r\n     sex; and we conjure you, our sisters of England, to aid us in\r\n     accomplishing this holy work. We remain with heartfelt respect,\r\n     your friends.[537]\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1858 there was established in Newcastle-on-Tyne an\r\nassociation called the Northern Reform Society, which had universal\r\nsuffrage for its object, and it expressly invited the contributions\r\nof women. Letters were written by Matilda Ashurst Biggs, and\r\nafterwards by two or three women in different parts of the country,\r\noffering to become members. In acknowledging these letters, the\r\nsecretary stated that the Northern Reform Union only contemplated\r\nthe extension of the franchise to men, although he admitted that\r\nmany of its leading members were individually in favor of \"woman\r\nsuffrage\" but they believed that by asking for manhood suffrage,\r\nthey were advancing a step towards universal franchise. He added.\r\n\"The society will be very glad of women's subscriptions, and trusts\r\nthat they will use their best efforts to promote its extension.\"\r\nUndoubtedly, there has never been any reluctance to accept the\r\nsubscriptions of women towards promoting the objects of men. In\r\ncommenting upon this letter, Mrs. Biggs[538] said in the _Newcastle\r\nGuardian_, February 19, 1859:\r\n\r\n     I have never given my rights to be merged in those of any other\r\n     person, and I feel it an injustice that I, who am equally taxed\r\n     with men, should be denied a voice in making the laws which\r\n     affect and dispose of my property, and made to support a State\r\n     wherein I am not recognized as a citizen. I consider that a\r\n     tyranny which renders me responsible to laws in the making of\r\n     which I am not consulted. The Northern Reform Society, which\r\n     \"takes its stand upon justice,\" should claim for us at least that\r\n     we be exempted from the duties, it we are to be denied the rights\r\n     belonging to citizens.\r\n\r\nThese books, speeches and letters though scattered and unconnected,\r\nslowly prepared the ground for the organized agitation. Another\r\nReform bill grew into preparation. Men's thoughts were turned again\r\ntowards the question of representation, and every word spoken on\r\nbehalf of the enfranchisement of women assumed double force as it\r\ndrew near to a political issue. The enfranchisement of women\r\nadvanced from a question of philosophical speculation to actual\r\npolitics in the election of John Stuart Mill member of parliament\r\nfor Westminster in 1865. In his election address, Mr. Mill, as\r\npreviously in his work on representative government, openly avowed\r\nthis article of political faith. Nevertheless, the first speech of\r\nwhich we have record in the House of Commons plainly vindicating\r\nthe right of women to the vote, was that of a man who differed from\r\nMr. Mill in every other feature of his political life and\r\ncreed--Mr. Disraeli. He used almost the same form of argument as\r\nSir Robert Peel had done thirty years before, but unlike the former\r\nstatesman he backed it up with his vote and personal influence for\r\nmany succeeding years. It was in 1866 that he spoke these words,\r\nlong and gratefully remembered by the women of the country:\r\n\r\n     In a country governed by a woman--where you allow woman to form\r\n     part of the estate of the realm--peeresses in their own right for\r\n     example--where you allow a woman not only to hold land, but to be\r\n     a lady of the manor and hold legal courts--where a woman by law\r\n     may be a church-warden and overseer of the poor,--I do not see,\r\n     where she has so much to do with the State and Church, on what\r\n     reasons, if you come to right, she has not a right to vote.\r\n\r\nThese words from Disraeli were the spark that fired the train. In\r\nanswer to a request from Miss Jessie Boucherett, Mrs. Bodichon and\r\nMiss Bessie R. Parkes, Mr. Mill replied that if they could find a\r\nhundred women who would sign a petition for the franchise, he would\r\npresent it to the House of Commons. A committee was immediately\r\nformed in London, and the petition was circulated. In two or three\r\nweeks it had received 1,499 signatures. Among these were many who\r\nin after years took a prominent part, not only in suffrage, but in\r\nother movements for the elevation of women. The petition was\r\npresented by Mr. Mill in May, 1866, and was received with laughter.\r\nHe then gave notice of a motion to introduce into the Reform bill a\r\nprovision to the same effect. The committee[539] immediately began\r\nto circulate petitions and pamphlets. Two of these were by Mrs.\r\nBodichon, \"Reasons for, and Objections against the Enfranchisement\r\nof Women,\" being the substance of a paper she had read at the\r\nSocial Science Congress, in October, 1866. We give the text of the\r\npetition, as it differed somewhat from those circulated in after\r\nyears:\r\n\r\n     _To the Honorable, the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great\r\n     Britain and Ireland, in Parliament assembled:_\r\n\r\n     The humble petition of the undersigned,--showeth, That your\r\n     petitioners fulfill the conditions of property or rental\r\n     prescribed by law as the qualification of the electoral\r\n     franchise, and exercise in their own names the rights pertaining\r\n     to such conditions; that the principles in which the government\r\n     of the United Kingdom is based, imply the representation of all\r\n     classes and interests in the State; that the reasons alleged for\r\n     withholding the franchise from certain classes of her majesty's\r\n     subjects do not apply to your petitioners. Your petitioners\r\n     therefore humbly pray your honorable House to grant to such\r\n     persons as fulfill all the conditions which entitle to a vote in\r\n     the election of members of parliament, excepting only that of\r\n     sex, the privilege of taking part in the choice of fit persons to\r\n     represent the people in your honorable House.\r\n\r\nThis form of petition was only signed by unmarried women and widows\r\nof full age, holding the legal qualification for voting in either\r\ncounty or borough, but there were other forms for other classes of\r\npersons. On March 28, the Right Hon. H. A. Bruce presented a\r\npetition from 3,559 persons, mostly women. Mr. Mill, in April,\r\npresented one with 3,161 names collected by the Manchester\r\ncommittee, and the Right Hon. Russell Gurney one signed by 1,605\r\nqualified women, _i. e._, free-holders and householders who would\r\nhave had the vote had they been men. In all 13,497 were counted in\r\nthe parliamentary report this session; among these were many\r\nclergymen, barristers, physicians and fellows of colleges.\r\n\r\nWhile we are on the subject of petitions we may as well briefly\r\nglance at what was done in this branch of work during succeeding\r\nyears.[540] No better method could be found of testing public\r\nopinion, or of affording scope for quiet, intelligent agitation.\r\nMany friends could help by circulating petitions, distributing\r\nliterature at the same time and arguing away objections. In 1868\r\nthere were presented 78 petitions with nearly 50,000 signatures.\r\nOne of them, headed by Mrs. Somerville and Florence Nightingale,\r\ncontained 21,000 names, and was a heavy but delightful burden which\r\nMr. Mill could hardly carry to the table. This petition excited\r\ngreat attention. During all these years no petitions were presented\r\nagainst granting the suffrage to women. These numbers were\r\nundoubtedly a surprise to many members of parliament who were\r\ninclined to look upon woman suffrage as an \"impracticable fad,\"\r\n\"the fantastic crochet of a few shrieking sisters.\" But the\r\ncollection and arrangement of the signatures took up incalculable\r\ntime, and after a few years this method of agitation was discarded\r\nto a great extent in the large political centres. Friends became\r\nwearied out with the toilsome process of year by year collecting\r\nsignatures, which when presented were silently and indifferently\r\ndropped into the bag under the table of the House of Commons. But\r\nduring the early days of the movement these petitions, signed by\r\nall classes of men and women, were invaluable in arousing interest\r\nin our movement.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, for the better prosecution of the work, instead of one\r\ncommittee embracing the whole of England, separate associations\r\nwere formed in London, Manchester and Edinburgh. The London\r\ncommittee consisted of ladies only, Miss Frances Power Cobbe, Mrs.\r\nFawcett, Miss Hampson, Miss Hare, Mrs. Lucas, Mrs. Stansfeld, with\r\nMrs. Taylor as secretary. In the Manchester committee Mr. Jacob\r\nBright, M. P., at once took up the position of leader and advocate\r\nwhich he afterwards so long and nobly maintained in the House of\r\nCommons. Miss Becker was appointed secretary. The Edinburgh\r\ncommittee elected Mrs. McLaren[541] for their president. At a\r\nspecial general meeting, November 6, 1867, it was resolved that\r\nthese three societies should form one national society, thus\r\nsecuring the advantages of cooeperation while maintaining freedom of\r\naction. The same rule applied to societies in Birmingham, Bristol\r\nand other towns.\r\n\r\nTo return to the debate in the House of Commons on May 20, 1867 on\r\nclause 4 of the Representation of the People bill. Mr. Mill moved\r\nto leave out the word \"man\" and insert the word \"person.\" His\r\nspeech has been too long before the public to need quotation; it is\r\na model of inductive reasoning and masterly eloquence. The debate\r\nwhich followed was very unequal in character, but the division was\r\ngratifying, for he received 73 votes (including pairs, 81); 194\r\nvoted against him. Mr. Mill wrote afterwards to a friend:\r\n\r\n     We are all delighted at the number of our minority, which is far\r\n     greater than anybody expected the first time, and would have been\r\n     greater still had not many members quitted the House, with or\r\n     without pairing, in the expectation that the subject would not\r\n     come on. But the greatest triumph of all was John Bright's vote.\r\n\r\nAt the election for Manchester, held near the end of 1867 (when Mr.\r\nJacob Bright was elected), Lily Maxwell, whose name had been\r\naccidentally left on the parliamentary register, recorded her vote.\r\nNo objection was taken to it by the returning officer, or by the\r\nagents of either candidate. The _Times_ devoted a leading article\r\nto it. The circumstance was of no legal value, but it was useful to\r\nshow that a woman could go through the process of recording a vote\r\nin a parliamentary election even before the Ballot act was passed.\r\nThe idea gained ground that by the new Reform act the right to vote\r\nhad been secured to women. The Reform act of 1867, sec. 3, declares\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n     Every man shall in and after the year 1868 be entitled to be\r\n     registered as a voter, and when registered, to vote for a member\r\n     to serve in parliament.\r\n\r\nIn the substitution of the word \"man\" for that of \"male person\"\r\nin the Reform act of 1832, a great difference was already\r\ndiscernable, but this difference was more important when taken into\r\nconjunction with what was popularly known as \"Lord Romilly's act,\"\r\nan act for shortening the language used in acts of parliament (13\r\nand 14 Vict.). This act provides, \"that all words importing\r\nthe masculine gender shall be deemed and taken to include\r\nfemales, unless the contrary is expressly provided\"; and in the\r\nRepresentation of the People act there was no express provision to\r\nthe contrary. This had been pointed out by one or two members at\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the several societies united in a systematic endeavor\r\nto procure the insertion of women's names on the registers of\r\nelectors under the new Reform act. A circular respectfully\r\nrequesting the boards of overseers to insert on the list of voters\r\nthe names of all persons who had paid their rates, was sent to\r\nseveral hundred boards in different parts of the country. Very few\r\nreplies were received, but women were placed on the lists in many\r\ncounties, in Aberdeen, Salford and many small districts in\r\nLancaster, Middlesex, Kent, etc. The overseers of Manchester\r\ndeclined compliance. In that city there were 5,100 women\r\nhouseholders who claimed their votes, and when the revision courts\r\nwere opened in September, this claim came on for consideration. The\r\ncase was ably argued, but the revising barrister decided against\r\nadmitting it, granting, however, a case for trial at the Court of\r\nCommon Pleas. Another case was also granted, being that of Mrs.\r\nKyllman, a free-holder, her claim being under the old free-holding\r\nfranchise 8 Henry VI., to wit.:\r\n\r\n     Elections of knights of the shire shall be made in each county by\r\n     people dwelling and resident therein of whom each has free-hold\r\n     to the value of L40 by the year.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of districts the revising barristers disallowed the\r\nclaims; but in four district-revision courts the women's names were\r\nadmitted. In Finsbury, one of the metropolitan boroughs, Mr.\r\nChisholm Anstey was revising barrister, and he admitted them on\r\naccount of ancient English law; in Cockermouth, Winterton and two\r\ntownships of Lancashire, the revising barrister admitted them upon\r\nhis interpretation of the Reform act taken in conjunction with Lord\r\nRomilly's act. In the suffrage report for this year the number of\r\nwomen placed on the electoral roll by these decisions is estimated\r\nat about 230, but undoubtedly there were others concerning whom no\r\ninformation was received. In many cases the women voted: 15 did so\r\nin Finsbury (not only was there no disturbance, but hardly any\r\nremark was made, and they expressed their surprise that it was so\r\neasy a thing to do); 12 in Gordon and 10 in Levenshulme, both\r\nlittle districts in Lancashire, and smaller numbers in other\r\nplaces. In Chester the parliament candidate issued his election\r\nplacards to \"Ladies and Gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 7, the case of the 5,000 Manchester women householders\r\nwas argued before the Court of Common Pleas. Mr. J. D. Coleridge\r\n(now Lord Coleridge, Lord-chief-justice of England) and Dr.\r\nPankhurst were the counsel for the appellants. Mr. John Coleridge\r\nin an able argument spoke of the ancient constitutional right of\r\nwomen to take part in elections. He produced copies from the record\r\noffice of several indentures returning members to parliament, the\r\nsignatures of which were in the hand-writing of women, or to which\r\nwomen were parties. He argued that the term \"man\" in the Reform act\r\nincluded woman, not only generally but specifically, under the\r\nprovisions of Lord Romilly's act. The case was argued before\r\nLord-chief-justice Boville; the decision was given on November 9,\r\nand decisively pronounced that the new Reform act had never\r\nintended to include women, and that they were incapacitated from\r\nvoting. This decision did not affect the women who were already on\r\nthe register, and many voted in the general election which took\r\nplace afterwards. Thus women have been shut out from electoral\r\nrights, not by any decree of parliament, but by this decision of\r\nthe Court of Common Pleas. However there was no appeal from this\r\nCourt, except to parliament, and from this time forward the\r\ncharacter of the agitation changed. The year 1868 ended with a\r\nlegal decision which seemed crushing in its finality, while the\r\nsame year had given the most conclusive proof that women wished to\r\nvote, and would do so whenever the opportunity offered.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1869, gave another convincing proof that women were\r\neager to vote, and brought us the most substantial triumph yet\r\nobtained, due to the wisdom and skilful tactics of Mr. Jacob\r\nBright, member of parliament for Manchester. This victory was the\r\nmunicipal franchise for women. Early in 1869 Mr. Hibbert introduced\r\na bill to regulate the conditions of the municipal franchise. By\r\nthe Municipal Corporation Amendment act, passed in 1835, male\r\npersons only were authorized to vote. The present bill was to amend\r\nthat. Mr. Jacob Bright, seconded by Sir Charles Dilke and Mr.\r\nPeter Rylands, proposed the omission of the word \"male\" from the\r\nbill, and the insertion of a clause securing to women the right of\r\nvoting in municipal elections. Mr. Hibbert concurred in the\r\nintroduction of these amendments, though he did not anticipate they\r\nwould lead to any result beyond a discussion. A circular containing\r\nfull information upon the ancient and existing rights of women to\r\nvote in local affairs was sent to each member of parliament by the\r\nManchester committee. It showed that before the passing of the\r\nMunicipal Corporation act of 1835, women rate-payers had rights\r\nsimilar to those of men in all matters pertaining to local\r\ngovernment and expenditure; and that in non-corporate districts\r\nthey still exercised such rights, under the provisions of the\r\nPublic Health act, and other statutes guarding the electoral\r\nprivileges of the whole body of rate-payers. But when any district\r\nwas incorporated into a municipal borough, the women rate-payers\r\nwere disfranchised, although those not included within its\r\nboundaries remained possessed of votes. It showed also that women\r\ncan vote in parochial matters, and take part in vestry meetings,\r\ncalled for various purposes, such as the election of church-wardens\r\nand way-wardens, the appointment of overseers, the sale of parish\r\nproperty, and, formerly, the levying of church-rates; also that\r\nthey can vote in the election of poor-law guardians--that in fact,\r\nin none of those ancient voting customs, was the sex of the\r\nratepayers taken into consideration as either a qualification or\r\ndisqualification. We quote from the Manchester society:\r\n\r\n     In the House of Commons on June 7, 1869, on consideration of the\r\n     Municipal Franchise bill as amended, Mr. Jacob Bright rose to\r\n     move that in this act and the said recited act (Municipal\r\n     Corporation Reform act, 1835) wherever words occur which import\r\n     the masculine gender, the same shall be held to include females\r\n     for all purposes connected with and having reference to the\r\n     election of or power to elect representatives of any municipal\r\n     corporation. He stated that his object was to give the municipal\r\n     vote to every rate-payer within the municipal limits; to give to\r\n     municipal property the representation which all property enjoyed\r\n     elsewhere; that had the proposition been an innovation, a\r\n     departure from the customary legislation of the country, he would\r\n     not have brought it in as an amendment to a bill; but that his\r\n     object was to remove an innovation--to resist one of the most\r\n     remarkable invasions of long-established rights which the\r\n     legislation of this or any other country could show. The bill\r\n     before the house was an amendment of the Municipal Corporation\r\n     act of 1835. That act was the only act in regard to local\r\n     expenditure and local government which established this\r\n     disability. Before and since, all acts of parliament gave every\r\n     local vote to every rate-payer. The Health of Towns act of 1848\r\n     had a clause almost identical with the one he was moving. He was\r\n     therefore asking the House not only to make the bill in harmony\r\n     with the general legislation of the country, but to allow it to\r\n     be in harmony with its latest expressed convictions as shown in\r\n     the act of 1848. There were in England 78 non-corporate towns\r\n     which were not parliamentary boroughs, with populations varying\r\n     from 20,000 to 6,000. In these every rate-payer voted. There was\r\n     little if any difference between their government and that of\r\n     municipal towns. Who could assign a reason why women should vote\r\n     in one and not in the other? Every parochial vote was in the\r\n     hands of the whole body of rate-payers. Women held the most\r\n     important parochial offices. The sister of the member for\r\n     Stockport had acted as overseer. Miss Burdett Coutts had been\r\n     urged to take the office of guardian. Had she been a large\r\n     rate-payer in a municipal town, what an absurdity to shut her out\r\n     from the vote! He then showed how the process of disfranchisement\r\n     was going on, and quoted Darlington and Southport. The latter\r\n     town was incorporated in 1867. In 1866, 2,085 persons were\r\n     qualified to vote for commissioners; 588 of these were women.\r\n     From the moment of incorporation these votes were extinguished\r\n     without a reason being assigned, though they had exercised them\r\n     from time immemorial. Such would be the case with any town\r\n     incorporated in the future. He appealed to the metropolitan\r\n     members, and showed them that unless his clauses were carried,\r\n     when they came to establish corporations throughout the\r\n     metropolis, as some of them desired, all the female rate-payers\r\n     would be struck off the roll; that over a population of 3,000,000\r\n     this exclusion would prevail. He stated that where women had the\r\n     vote they exercised it to an equal degree with the men. Mr.\r\n     Lings, the comptroller for the city of Manchester, affirms that\r\n     according to his experience the number of men and women who vote\r\n     in local affairs bears a just proportion to the number of each on\r\n     the register. He showed that as the bill was a largely\r\n     enfranchising measure, his clause was in strict harmony with it,\r\n     but that while the bill sought to increase the representation of\r\n     those who were already considerably represented, the clause which\r\n     he wished to add would give representation to those who within\r\n     municipal towns were totally deprived of it. He concluded by\r\n     saying that questions had come to him, since these amendments had\r\n     been on the paper, from women in different parts of the country,\r\n     and from those who by their social and intellectual positions\r\n     might be regarded as representatives of their sex, asking why\r\n     there should always be this tender regard for the representation\r\n     and therefore the protection of men, and this apparent disregard\r\n     for the interest of women; and he appealed to the House, by its\r\n     decision, to show that as regards these local franchises it had a\r\n     common regard for the whole body of rate-payers.\r\n\r\nMr. Jacob Bright's motion, which he supported with all the tact,\r\nearnestness and judgment of which he afterwards gave such repeated\r\nproofs in bringing forward his Women's Disabilities bill, was\r\nseconded by Mr. Rylands. Mr. Bruce (the home secretary) said he\r\nhad shown conclusively that this proposition was no novelty, and\r\nthat women were allowed to vote in every form of local government,\r\nexcept under the Municipal Corporations act. The clause introduced\r\nno anomaly, and he should give it his cordial support. Mr. Hibbert\r\nalso supported the clause, which was agreed to amid cheers, and it\r\nwas passed without a dissentient word or the faintest shadow of\r\nopposition, as was also the proposal of Sir Charles Dilke, to leave\r\nout the word \"male\" in the first clause.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Lords an attempt was made by Lord Redesdale to\r\nreverse the decision of the House of Commons, but the proposal\r\nfound no seconder, and therefore fell to the ground. The Earl of\r\nKimberley, on behalf of the government, supported the proposition,\r\nas did also Lord Cairns, from the opposition benches. The Municipal\r\nFranchise bill became law in August, 1869. One well-known statesman\r\nsaid at the time, \"This is a revolution; this vote means still\r\nanother, and there never was so great a revolution so speedily\r\naccomplished.\" In 1869 the Ballot act had not been passed; this was\r\nin the days of open voting. It was therefore possible to ascertain\r\nwith accuracy in how large a proportion the women householders\r\navailed themselves of their restored right to vote whenever a\r\ncontested election took place. On the following November a letter\r\nof inquiry was sent to the town clerk of every municipal borough in\r\nEngland and Wales, and by their courtesy in replying it was\r\nascertained that the women voted in very large numbers. In our\r\nmunicipal towns the average ratio of women householders to men\r\nhouseholders is about one to seven. This varies greatly in\r\ndifferent localities. In Tewkesbury, for instance, there was only\r\none woman householder to twenty-three men householders, while in\r\nBath the proportion had risen as high as one to three. The women\r\nvoters were in about the same proportion. In the larger boroughs\r\nthe proportion was especially good, while there were cases in which\r\nthe polling of the women exceeded that of the men. In Bodmin,\r\nCornwall, two women voted, one of whom was 92 and the other 94\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\nThe first public meeting in connection with women's suffrage was\r\nheld in Manchester, April 14, 1868, in the assembly room of the\r\nFree Trade Hall. The occasion was one of great interest. Mr. Henry\r\nD. Pochin, the mayor of Salford (which adjoins Manchester), took\r\nthe chair, and the first resolution was moved by Miss Becker,\r\nseconded by the venerable Arch-deacon Sandford, and supported by\r\nMr. T. B. Potter, M. P.:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the exclusion of women from the exercise of the\r\n     franchise in the election of members, being unjust in principle\r\n     and inexpedient in practice, this meeting is of opinion that the\r\n     right of voting should be granted to them on the same conditions\r\n     as it is or may be granted to men.\r\n\r\nThe other resolutions were spoken to by Dr. Pankhurst, Mrs. Pochin\r\n(who had also written a very exhaustive pamphlet on \"The Claim of\r\nWoman to the Elective Franchise,\" signed, _Justitia_), Mr. Chisholm\r\nAnstey, Mr. Jacob Bright, M. P., Miss Annie Robertson of Dublin,\r\nMr. F. W. Myers, fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Mr. J.\r\nW. Edwards. This meeting, and the one which followed in Birmingham,\r\nMay 6, are fair types of those which have followed by thousands.\r\nWith few exceptions they have been addressed by men and women\r\njointly; the resolutions passed have generally been of a directly\r\npractical and political character. They have been presided over,\r\nwhenever possible, by the chief magistrate, or some other\r\nwell-known man in the locality; in comparatively few cases have\r\nwomen presided, and very seldom, indeed, strangers. Thus they have\r\nbeen modeled closely on the ordinary English political meeting; and\r\nthis form, quite apart from the principles discussed at the\r\nmeetings, has done much to identify women's suffrage with the\r\npractical politics of the day. The first meeting ever held in\r\nLondon (July, 1869,) excited much attention. Admittance here was by\r\nticket. Mrs. Peter A. Taylor took the chair; Miss Biggs read the\r\nreport, and a noble array of speakers followed.[542]\r\n\r\nThe principle of women's suffrage was unhesitatingly conceded by\r\nthe passing of the Municipal Amendment act of 1869. The time was\r\ncome to demand its application in parliamentary elections.\r\nMoreover, the decision of the Court of Common Pleas had left no\r\nmode of action possible except for parliament to reverse that\r\ndecision. Mr. Jacob Bright, therefore, on the first day of the\r\nsession gave notice of his intention to introduce a bill to remove\r\nthe electoral disabilities of women. Sir Charles Dilke, a Liberal,\r\nand Mr. E. B. Eastwick, a Conservative, also gave their names on\r\nthe back of the bill.\r\n\r\n     A BILL _to remove the Electoral Disabilities of Women_:\r\n\r\n     Be it enacted by the Queen's most excellent Majesty, by and with\r\n     the advice and consent of the Lords, spiritual and temporal, and\r\n     Commons in this present parliament assembled, and by the\r\n     authority of the same, as follows:\r\n\r\n     _First_--That in all acts relating to the qualification and\r\n     registration of voters or persons entitled or claiming to be\r\n     registered and to vote in the election of members of parliament,\r\n     wherever words occur which import the masculine gender, the same\r\n     shall be held to include females for all purposes connected with,\r\n     and having reference to the right to be registered as voters, and\r\n     to vote in such elections, any law or usage to the contrary\r\n     notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nOn February 16, the bill was read for the first time, and on May 4,\r\nit came on for its second reading. Mr. Jacob Bright earnestly\r\nappealed to the House to grant this measure of justice:\r\n\r\n     The women who are interested in this subject, he concluded, are\r\n     only acting in the spirit of one of the noblest proverbs of our\r\n     language, \"God helps those who help themselves.\" Is it a matter\r\n     of regret to us that they should have these aspirations? Ought it\r\n     not rather to be a subject of satisfaction and of pride? That\r\n     this bill will become law, no one who has observed the character\r\n     of this agitation and who knows the love of justice in the\r\n     British people can doubt. I hope it will become law soon, for I\r\n     have a desire which will receive the sympathy of many in this\r\n     House. I have a strong desire that when our children come to read\r\n     the story of their country's fame, it may be written there that\r\n     the British parliament was the first great legislative assembly\r\n     in the world, which, in conferring its franchises, knew nothing\r\n     of the distinctions of strong and weak, of male and female, of\r\n     rich and poor.\r\n\r\nThe result of the division surprised and cheered all the supporters\r\nof the measure. The government was neutral, and members of the\r\ncabinet voted on either side according to their own opinions. The\r\nsecond reading was carried by a vote of 124 to 91, being a majority\r\nin its favor of 33. Those who witnessed that division will never\r\nforget the grateful enthusiasm with which Mr. Jacob Bright was\r\nreceived when he came up to the ladies' gallery, with his wife\r\nleaning upon his arm. But our triumph was short-lived. Before the\r\nbill went into committee, a week later, it became known that the\r\ngovernment intended to depart from its attitude of neutrality. A\r\nstrong pressure was exercised to crush the bill, and the contest of\r\ncourse became hopeless. On the division for going into committee\r\n220 votes were counted against 94 in its favor.\r\n\r\nIt became evident that we were in for a long contest, which would\r\nrequire not only patience, courage and determination, but a high\r\ndegree of political sagacity. Organizations had to be perfected,\r\nand additional societies established; meetings had to be called,\r\nand lectures given to explain the question. In March of this year\r\nthe _Women's Suffrage Journal_ was established in Manchester. Miss\r\nBecker has conducted this monthly from the beginning with great\r\ntalent and spirit; it is frequently quoted by the ordinary press,\r\nand its pages contain the best record extant of the movement. This\r\nsame year of 1870, which witnessed our first parliamentary defeat,\r\nbrought compensation also of such magnitude as to outweigh the\r\ntemporary overthrow of the franchise bill. This was the Elementary\r\nEducation act, by which women were not only admitted to vote for\r\nschool-board candidates, but expressly enabled to sit on these\r\nboards, and thus exercise not only elective, but legislative\r\nfunctions of the most important character. The election clause\r\nreads thus:\r\n\r\n     The school-board shall be elected in the manner provided by this\r\n     act, in a borough by the persons whose names are on the burgess\r\n     roll of such borough for the time being in force, and in a parish\r\n     not situated in the metropolis, by the rate-payers.\r\n\r\nIn London, with the sole exception of the city, the persons who\r\nelect the vestries, _i. e._ the rate-payers, are the electors--this\r\nincludes women as a matter of course. In the city only,\r\nthe electors were to be the same persons who elected\r\ncommon-council-men, and as these included men only, women are thus\r\nexcluded from voting in the school-board election, though even here\r\nit may be observed they are eligible to sit on the board. Thus,\r\nwithin the space of two years, two important measures were extended\r\nunexpectedly.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 Mr. Jacob Bright again introduced the Women's Disabilities\r\nRemoval bill, and it was also supported by Mr. Eastwick and Dr.\r\nLyon Playfair. It was thrown out in the division upon the second\r\nreading on May 3, by a majority of 69; 151 (including tellers and\r\npairs 159) voting for it, and 220 (including tellers and pairs 228)\r\nvoting against it. The most remarkable feature of the debate was a\r\nspeech made by Mr. Gladstone, which certainly justified the\r\nconfidence that women have subsequently entertained that the great\r\nminister was willing to see justice done to them:\r\n\r\n     The ancient law recognized the rights of women in the parish; I\r\n     apprehend they could both vote and act in the parish. The modern\r\n     rule has extended the right to the municipality, so far as the\r\n     right of voting is concerned.... With respect to school-boards, I\r\n     own I believe that we have done wisely, on the whole, in giving\r\n     both the franchise and the right of sitting on the school-board\r\n     to women. Then comes a question with regard to parliament, and we\r\n     have to ask ourselves whether we shall or shall not go\r\n     further.... I admit, at any rate, that as far as I am able to\r\n     judge, there is more presumptive ground for change in the law\r\n     than some of the opponents of the measure are disposed to\r\n     own.... I cannot help thinking that, for some reason or other,\r\n     there are various important particulars in which women obtain\r\n     much less than justice under social arrangements.... I may be\r\n     told that there is no direct connection between this and the\r\n     parliamentary franchise, and I admit it, but at the same time I\r\n     am by no means sure that these inequalities may not have an\r\n     indirect connection with a state of law in which the balance is\r\n     generally cast too much against women, and too much in favor of\r\n     men. There is one instance which has been quoted, and I am not\r\n     sure there is not something in it--I mean the case of farms.... I\r\n     believe to some extent in the competition for that particular\r\n     employment women suffer in a very definite manner in consequence\r\n     of their want of qualification to vote. I go somewhat further\r\n     than this, and say that so far as I am able to form an opinion of\r\n     the general tone and color of our law in these matters, where the\r\n     peculiar relation of men and women is concerned, that law does\r\n     less than justice to women [hear, hear], and great mischief,\r\n     misery and scandal result from that state of things in many of\r\n     the occurrences and events of life. [Cheers.] ... If it should be\r\n     found possible to arrange a safe and well-adjusted alteration of\r\n     the law as to political power, the man who shall attain that\r\n     object, and who shall see his purpose carried onward to its\r\n     consequences in a more just arrangement of the provisions of\r\n     other laws bearing upon the condition and welfare of women, will,\r\n     in my opinion, be a real benefactor to his country. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nIn another portion of his speech Mr. Gladstone said that the\r\npersonal attendance of women in election proceedings, until the\r\nprinciple of secret voting should be adopted, was in his eyes an\r\nobjection of the greatest force--thus giving reason to believe that\r\nas soon as vote by ballot was secured, this objection would be\r\nremoved. Mr. Gladstone did not on this occasion vote against the\r\nbill, but left the House without voting.\r\n\r\nIn 1872, our indefatigable leader again moved the second reading of\r\nthe bill on the 4th of May. His speech was calm and masterly, and\r\nhe was ably supported, but the division remained much the same; 143\r\nfor the bill and 222 against it. This year the Scotch Education\r\nbill was passed, which extended the voting of women and their\r\nelection on school-boards to Scotland; thus the principle of direct\r\nrepresentation on a matter so important as national education was\r\nrecognized. The Ballot act also, which at once rendered elections\r\norderly and safe, henceforth gave increased security and comfort to\r\nwomen who were voting in municipal elections.\r\n\r\nIn this year a new committee was established in London called the\r\nCentral committee, to which all other branches of the society had\r\nthe right of appointing delegates, and the movement received\r\nthereby a considerable increase of strength and solidity.[543]\r\n\r\nMeantime each branch of the society was working away indefatigably.\r\nDuring 1871, the _Suffrage Journal_ recorded 135 public meetings,\r\nand during 1872, 104 in England and 63 in Scotland. The work in\r\nScotland was chiefly carried on in the way of lectures by Miss Jane\r\nTaylour, who during these early years of the movement was an\r\nuntiring and spirited pioneer, Miss Agnes McLaren often\r\naccompanying her and helping her to organize the meetings.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to mention Mary Burton (sister of John Hill Burton\r\nthe historiographer of Scotland), who was also one of the most\r\nenergetic workers of the Edinburgh committee, especially in the\r\nnorth of Scotland; and Mrs. Dick Lauder who had the courage to free\r\nherself from the opinions in which she had been educated, and with\r\nmuch sacrifice devoted herself to the work. Space fails us fitly to\r\nrecord the indomitable efforts of Eliza Wigham, one of the\r\nhonorable secretaries of the Edinburgh committee. In England, Mrs.\r\nRonniger organized and spoke at many meetings, as did Mrs. Fawcett,\r\nMiss Rhoda Garrett, Miss Becker, Miss Craigen and, less frequently,\r\nMrs. Josephine Butler, Lady Amberley, Miss Annie Young and others.\r\nMrs. Grote, wife of the historian and herself a well-known author,\r\ntook part in one meeting held in Hanover Square rooms, London, on\r\nMarch 26, 1870. Mrs. Grote was then upwards of seventy years of\r\nage. Rising with great majesty, she spoke with all the weight that\r\nage, ability and experience could give, greatly impressing her\r\naudience. Miss Helen Taylor, step-daughter of John Stuart Mill,\r\nalso made her maiden speech at this meeting; it was delivered with\r\nmuch grace, excellent in thought as in manner.\r\n\r\nMany additional local committees were established, and good work\r\nwas done by familiarizing the public mind with the principles of\r\nthe association. Ward meetings were held in which the women\r\nburgesses and municipal voters were assembled, and while the\r\nresponsibilities of the vote they already possessed were pointed\r\nout to them, attention was called to the prior importance of the\r\nvote which was withheld from them.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, for the fourth time, our unwearied champion, Mr. Jacob\r\nBright, brought forward his bill. This time the second reading was\r\nfixed for April 30. He was supported in the debate by Mr. Eastwick,\r\nSergeant Sherlock, Lord John Manners, Mr. Fawcett, Mr. Heron, Mr.\r\nHenley, and Sir J. Trelawny. While all these gentlemen deserved our\r\nthanks for the able assistance they rendered the cause, the speech\r\nof Mr. Henley, Conservative member for Oxfordshire, so old a member\r\nthat he was styled the \"Father of the House,\" excited special\r\nattention. He said he had once felt considerable doubt and dislike\r\nof the measure, but after careful watching of the way in which\r\nwomen gave the local votes, he had come to the conclusion that an\r\nextension of the principle would be useful. The votes in favor of\r\nthe bill increased at this debate to 155 (with tellers and pairs\r\n172), a larger number than had ever before been obtained, while the\r\nopposition remained stationary.\r\n\r\nAlong with the petitions of this year were two memorials signed by\r\nupwards of 11,000 women, and presented to Mr. Gladstone and Mr.\r\nDisraeli. Every English county, with the exception of the smallest,\r\nRutland, and most large towns sent representative signatures. An\r\neffort was made this session by Mr. William Johnston, the member\r\nfor Belfast, to introduce amendments into the Irish Municipal bill,\r\nwhich would have had the effect of extending the municipal\r\nfranchise to Irish women householders. But the bill was withdrawn,\r\nand similar efforts made in subsequent years have met with the like\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nThis year the death of Mr. John Stuart Mill saddened the hearts of\r\nall. He will never be forgotten as the first man who carried this\r\nquestion into the arena of practical politics and gave it the\r\nweight of an honored name. The strength and vitality of the\r\nmovement were further tested by a disaster which threatened to do\r\nit a lasting injury. The general election took place early in the\r\nspring of 1874, and to the regret and consternation of the friends\r\nof equal suffrage, their able and devoted leader, Mr. Jacob Bright,\r\nlost his seat for Manchester--a loss in a great degree attributable\r\nto his unshrinking advocacy of an unpopular question. Never did his\r\nclients, for whom he had sacrificed so much, feel so deeply the\r\nneed of the power which the franchise would have given them to keep\r\nso good a friend in the House of Commons. Not only was Mr. Bright\r\ndefeated, but Mr. Eastwick, the friend who had always seconded the\r\nbill, also lost his seat with about seventy others of our\r\nsupporters. We were thus compelled to look around for fresh\r\nleaders. The task of bringing in a bill was accepted by Mr.\r\nForsyth, the Conservative member for Marylebone, one of the London\r\nboroughs; with him were associated Mr. Stansfeld, Mr. Russell\r\nGurney and Sir R. Anstruther, men differing widely on matters of\r\nparty politics. The bill was introduced early in the session, but\r\nno day was found for it, and in the middle of July it was\r\nwithdrawn. Considerable discussion was excited by the unexpected\r\naction of Mr. Forsyth, who on his own responsibility inserted in\r\nthe bill an additional clause by which married women were\r\nespecially excluded from its operation. Although the insertion of\r\nthis clause would probably have made no difference, the bulk of\r\nlegal opinion being that under the law of coverture, married women\r\neven when possessed of property are not \"qualified persons,\" yet\r\nthe society joined in requesting that this additional clause should\r\nbe dropped and the original form of the bill adhered to.\r\n\r\nMemorials, signed by upwards of 18,000 women headed by Florence\r\nNightingale, Harriet Martineau, Lady Anna Gore Langton (sister of\r\nthe Duke of Buckingham), Frances Power Cobbe, Anna Swanwick, were\r\nagain this year forwarded to Mr. Disraeli and Mr. Gladstone. An\r\nimportant memorial was also forwarded from a large conference held\r\nin Birmingham in January, which represents very accurately the\r\nspecial aspects of the question in England. The president of the\r\nconference was Mrs. William Taylor, sister-in-law of Mr. Peter A.\r\nTaylor, M. P.:\r\n\r\n     _To the Right Honorable William Ewart Gladstone, M. P., First\r\n     Lord of Her Majesty's Treasury:_\r\n\r\n     The memorial of members and friends of the National Society for\r\n     Women's Suffrage, in conference assembled at Birmingham, January\r\n     22, 1874, showeth, that your memorialists earnestly desire to\r\n     urge on the attention of her majesty's government the justice and\r\n     expediency of abolishing the disability which precludes women,\r\n     otherwise legally qualified, from voting in the election of\r\n     members of parliament.\r\n\r\n     They submit that the disability is anomalous, inasmuch as it\r\n     exists only in respect to the parliamentary franchise. The\r\n     electoral rights of women have been from time immemorial equal\r\n     and similar to those of men in parochial and other ancient\r\n     franchises, and in the year 1869 a measure was passed, with the\r\n     sanction of the administration of which you are the head,\r\n     restoring and confirming the rights of women ratepayers to the\r\n     exercise of the municipal franchise.\r\n\r\n     The electoral disability is further anomalous, because by the law\r\n     and constitution of this realm, women are not disabled from the\r\n     exercise of political power. Writs, returning members to serve\r\n     in the House of Commons, signed by women as electors or returning\r\n     officers, are now in existence, and the validity of such returns\r\n     has never been disputed. Women who were heirs to peerages and\r\n     other dignities exercised judicial jurisdiction and enjoyed other\r\n     privileges appertaining to such offices and lordships without\r\n     disability of sex. The highest political function known to the\r\n     constitution may be exercised by a woman. The principle that\r\n     women may have political power is coeval with the British\r\n     constitution. On the other hand the practice of women taking part\r\n     in voting at popular elections is equally ancient in date, and\r\n     has been restored and extended by the action of the present\r\n     parliament. Your memorialists therefore submit that to bring the\r\n     existing principle and practice into harmony by removing the\r\n     disability which prevents women who vote in local elections from\r\n     voting in the election of members of parliament, would be a step\r\n     in the natural process of development by which institutions,\r\n     while retaining the strength and authority derived from the\r\n     traditions of the past, and preserving the continuity of the\r\n     national life, continually undergo such modifications as are\r\n     needed in order to adapt them to the exigencies of the age and\r\n     the changed conditions of modern life.\r\n\r\n     They also submit that the old laws regulating the qualifications\r\n     of electors do not limit the franchise to male persons; that the\r\n     laws under which women exercised the parochial franchise were\r\n     couched in the same general terms as those regulating the\r\n     parliamentary suffrage, and that while the latter were not\r\n     expressly limited to men, the former were not expressly extended\r\n     to women. There is, therefore, a strong presumption that the\r\n     exclusion of women from the parliamentary suffrage was an\r\n     infringement on their ancient constitutional rights, rendered\r\n     possible in a barbarous age by the comparative weakness and\r\n     smallness of the number of persons affected by it, and continued\r\n     until the exclusion had become customary. The franchise of women\r\n     in local elections has been from time to time under judicial\r\n     consideration, and their right to take part in such elections has\r\n     been repeatedly confirmed by the judges. During the arguments in\r\n     these cases, the question of their right to vote in the election\r\n     of members of parliament was frequently mooted and conflicting\r\n     opinions thereon incidently expressed by various judges, but the\r\n     matter was never judicially decided, and no authoritative\r\n     judgment was ever given against the right until the year 1868,\r\n     after the passing of two modern acts of parliament in 1832 and\r\n     1867, the former of which for the first time in English history,\r\n     in terms, limited the franchise created by it to every \"male\r\n     person,\" and the latter to every \"man\" qualified under its\r\n     provisions. Your memorialists submit that had the question of the\r\n     right of women to vote in the election of members of parliament\r\n     been raised in the law courts under the old statutes which\r\n     contain no reference to sex, and before the passing of the\r\n     limiting acts of 1832 and 1867, that the precedents which had\r\n     determined the right in their favor in the construction of the\r\n     law as to local government must have been held to apply to the\r\n     case of qualified freeholders or others who claimed the right as\r\n     regards parliamentary government.\r\n\r\n     They submit also, that even after these limiting acts, women had\r\n     reasonable grounds for claiming the suffrage under the existing\r\n     law. There is an act of parliament which declares that \"in all\r\n     acts, words importing the masculine gender shall be deemed and\r\n     taken to include females, ... unless the contrary is _expressly\r\n     provided_.\" The act of 1867 contained clauses imposing personal\r\n     liabilities and pecuniary burdens on certain classes of\r\n     ratepayers. In these clauses, as in the enfranchising clauses,\r\n     and throughout the act, words importing the masculine gender were\r\n     alone used. No provision was made that these words should not\r\n     include females. Accordingly in enforcing the act the extra\r\n     liabilities and burdens were imposed on women ratepayers, to many\r\n     of whom they caused grievous hardship. There was, therefore,\r\n     reason to expect that the enfranchising clauses would bear the\r\n     same interpretation, inasmuch as they were confessedly offered as\r\n     an equivalent for the increased liabilities. But when the women\r\n     who had been subjected to the liabilities claimed their votes,\r\n     they found that words importing the masculine gender were held to\r\n     include women in the clauses imposing burdens, and to exclude\r\n     them in the clauses conferring privileges, in one and the same\r\n     act of parliament.\r\n\r\n     This kind of injustice was shown in a marked manner in the case\r\n     of certain women ratepayers of Bridgewater, who, in a memorial\r\n     addressed to you in 1871, set forth the grievance of most heavy\r\n     and unjust taxation which was levied on them, in common with the\r\n     other householders of that disfranchised borough, for the payment\r\n     of a prolonged commission respecting political bribery. The\r\n     memorialists felt it to be unjust and oppressive, inasmuch as,\r\n     not exercising the franchise nor being in any way directly or\r\n     indirectly concerned in the malpractices which led to the\r\n     commission, they were nevertheless required to pay not less than\r\n     three shillings in the pound according to their rental. To that\r\n     memorial you caused a reply to be sent through Mr. Secretary\r\n     Bruce, stating that \"it was not in the power of the secretary of\r\n     State to exempt women owning or occupying property from the local\r\n     and imperial taxation to which that property is liable.\" While\r\n     fully admitting this, your memorialists beg to represent that it\r\n     is in the power of the legislature to secure to women the vote\r\n     which their property would confer, along with its liability to\r\n     local and imperial taxation, were it owned or occupied by men.\r\n\r\n     They submit that this concession has recently been granted in\r\n     respect to local taxation, and that if justice demands that Women\r\n     should have a voice in controlling the municipal expenditure to\r\n     which their property contributes, justice yet more urgently\r\n     demands that they should have a voice in controlling the imperial\r\n     expenditure to which the same property is liable. The local\r\n     expenditure of the country amounts to about L30,000,000, the\r\n     imperial expenditure to about L70,000,000 annually; if,\r\n     therefore, the matter be regarded as one of taxation only, the\r\n     latter vote is of more importance than the former. Local\r\n     government deals with men and women alike, and knows no\r\n     distinction between male and female ratepayers. But imperial\r\n     government deals with men and women on different principles, and\r\n     in such a manner that whenever there is any distinction made in\r\n     the rights, privileges and protection accorded to them\r\n     respectively, the difference is always against women and in favor\r\n     of men. They believe this state of things is a natural result of\r\n     the exclusion of women from representation, and it will be found\r\n     impracticable to amend it until women are admitted to a share in\r\n     controlling the legislature.\r\n\r\n     By the deprivation of the parliamentary vote, women, in the\r\n     purchase or renting of property, obtain less for their money than\r\n     men. In a bill which passed the House of Commons last session,\r\n     provision was made for the amalgamation in one list of the\r\n     municipal and parliamentary registers of electors. In that list\r\n     it appeared that the same house, the same rent and the same taxes\r\n     conferred on a man the double vote in municipal and parliamentary\r\n     government, and on a woman the single vote only, and that the\r\n     less honorable and important one. When the occupation of a house\r\n     is transferred from a man to a woman, say to the widow of the\r\n     former owner, that home loses the privilege of representation in\r\n     the imperial government, though its relations with the\r\n     taxgatherer continue unaltered. There have been various societies\r\n     formed with a view to enable persons to acquire portions of\r\n     landed or real property, partly for the sake of the vote attached\r\n     to such property. Should a woman purchase or inherit such an\r\n     estate, the vote, which has been one important consideration in\r\n     determining the value, would be lost through her legal disability\r\n     to exercise it.\r\n\r\n     The deprivation of the vote is a serious disadvantage to women in\r\n     the competition for farms. A case is recorded of one estate in\r\n     Suffolk from which seven widows have been ejected, who, if they\r\n     had possessed votes, would have been continued as tenants. A\r\n     sudden ejection often means ruin to a family that has sunk\r\n     capital in the land, and it is only too probable that no day\r\n     passes without the occurrence of some such calamity to some\r\n     unhappy widow, who, but for the electoral disability, might have\r\n     retained the home and the occupation by which she could have\r\n     brought up her family in comfort and independence.\r\n\r\n     Besides this definite manner in which the electoral disability\r\n     injures women farmers, it has a more or less directly injurious\r\n     influence on all self-dependent women who maintain themselves and\r\n     their families by other than domestic labor. A disability, the\r\n     basis of which is the presumed mental or moral incapacity of the\r\n     subject of it to form a rational judgment on matters within the\r\n     ordinary ken of human intelligence, carries with it a stigma of\r\n     inferiority calculated to cause impediment to the entrance on or\r\n     successful prosecution of any pursuit demanding recognized\r\n     ability and energy. This presumed incapacity is probably the\r\n     origin of the general neglect of the education of women, which is\r\n     only now beginning to be acknowledged, and the absence of\r\n     political power in the neglected class renders it difficult if\r\n     not impossible to obtain an adequate share for girls in the\r\n     application of educational funds and endowments. So long as women\r\n     are specifically excluded from control over their parliamentary\r\n     representatives, so long will their interests be postponed to\r\n     claims of those who have votes to give; and while parliament\r\n     shall continue to declare that the voices of women are unfit to\r\n     be taken into account in choosing members of the legislature, the\r\n     masses of men will continue to act as if their wishes, opinions\r\n     and interests were undeserving of serious consideration.\r\n\r\n     It is now nearly two years since you, in your place in the House\r\n     of Commons, said that the number of absolutely self-dependent\r\n     women is increasing from year to year, and that the progressive\r\n     increase in the number of such women is a very serious fact,\r\n     because those women are assuming the burdens that belong to men;\r\n     and you stated your belief that when they are called upon to\r\n     assume those burdens, and to undertake the responsibility of\r\n     providing for their own subsistence, they approach the task under\r\n     greater difficulties than attach to their more powerful\r\n     competitors. Your memorialists therefore ask you to aid women in\r\n     overcoming these difficulties, by assisting to place them,\r\n     politically at least, on a level with those whom you designate as\r\n     \"their more powerful competitors.\"\r\n\r\n     One of the greatest hindrances in the path of self-dependent\r\n     women is the opposition shown by members of many trades and\r\n     professions to women who attempt to engage in them. The medical\r\n     and academical authorities of the University of Edinburgh have\r\n     successfully crushed the attempt of a small band of female\r\n     students to qualify themselves for the medical profession, and\r\n     the same spirit of \"trades unionism\" is rife in the industrial\r\n     community. A few months ago the printers of Manchester, learning\r\n     that a few girls were practicing type-setting, and endeavoring to\r\n     earn a little money thereby, instantly passed a rule ordaining a\r\n     strike in the shop of any master printer who should allow type\r\n     set up by women to be sent to his machines to be worked. At the\r\n     present time, in a manufacturing district in Yorkshire where\r\n     there are \"broad\" and \"narrow\" looms, at the former of which much\r\n     more money can be earned, the men refuse to allow women to work\r\n     at the broad looms, though they are quite able to manage them,\r\n     because the work is considered too remunerative for women. At\r\n     Nottingham there is a particular machine at which very high wages\r\n     can be earned, at which women now work, and the men, in order to\r\n     drive them out of such profitable employment, have insisted on\r\n     the masters taking no more women on, but as those at present\r\n     employed leave, supplying their places by men. A master\r\n     manufacturer reports: \"We have machines which women can manage\r\n     quite as well or better than men, yet are they not permitted by a\r\n     selfish combination of the strong against the weak.\" These are\r\n     only samples of the cases that are constantly occurring of\r\n     successful attempts to drive women out of remunerative\r\n     occupations. Your memorialists submit that women would be more\r\n     able to resist such attempts if they had the protection of the\r\n     suffrage; and that men would be less likely to be thus aggressive\r\n     and oppressive if they had learned to regard women as their\r\n     political equals.\r\n\r\n     Besides the restrictions on the industrial liberties of women\r\n     effected by combinations of men, there are existing and proposed\r\n     legislative restrictions from which men are exempt, and which\r\n     exercise a powerful influence on the market for their labor. For\r\n     the coming session we have the proposal further to limit their\r\n     hours of paid labor in factories, and to place other restrictions\r\n     on their labor in shops; also a proposition to place married\r\n     women on the footing of half-timers. Without here expressing any\r\n     opinion as to the wisdom of these proposals, we urge that members\r\n     of the House of Commons would be more capable of dealing with\r\n     them in a just and appreciative spirit if they were responsible\r\n     for their votes to the persons whose interests are directly\r\n     concerned and whose liberties they are asked to curtail; and,\r\n     further, that it is a grave question how far it is safe to trust\r\n     the industrial interests of women, as a class, to the\r\n     irresponsible control of the men who have manifested to\r\n     individuals and to sections of working women the spirit indicated\r\n     by the examples we have cited.\r\n\r\n     In the same speech you spoke of a state of the law in which the\r\n     balance is generally cast too much against women and too much in\r\n     favor of men. Since you directed your attention to this matter,\r\n     you have not been able either to introduce or to assist others\r\n     who have introduced measures to ameliorate the state of the law\r\n     respecting women, and such proposals have been unable to win\r\n     consideration from parliament. Your memorialists cannot believe\r\n     that this neglect has arisen from want of a desire on your part\r\n     to deal with the grievances under which you have admitted that\r\n     your countrywomen suffer; they are therefore led to the\r\n     conclusion that you have been unable to take into consideration\r\n     the affairs of an unrepresented class, owing to the preoccupation\r\n     of parliament with the concerns of those to whom it is directly\r\n     responsible.\r\n\r\n     You stated that \"the question was, to devise a method of enabling\r\n     women to exercise a sensible influence, without undertaking\r\n     personal functions and exposing themselves to personal\r\n     obligations inconsistent with the fundamental particulars of\r\n     their condition as women,\" and that the objection to the personal\r\n     attendance of women at elections was in your mind an objection of\r\n     the greatest force. They respectfully submit that the exercise of\r\n     the municipal franchise involves the personal attendance of women\r\n     at the polls, and that since your words were uttered changes have\r\n     been effected which render the process of voting absolutely\r\n     identical for municipal and parliamentary elections, and the\r\n     whole proceeding perfectly decorous and orderly. Experience has\r\n     proved that women can vote at municipal elections without\r\n     prejudice to the fundamental particulars of their condition as\r\n     women, whatever these may be; and this experience shows that they\r\n     may vote in parliamentary elections without the smallest personal\r\n     prejudice or inconvenience. The school-board elections have also\r\n     shown that women can appeal to large constituencies and go\r\n     through the ordeal of public meetings, addresses and questions\r\n     from electors, to which men must submit who seek the suffrages of\r\n     a great community, without any sacrifice of womanly dignity, or\r\n     of the respect and consideration accorded to their position and\r\n     their sex. They therefore submit that events have obviated the\r\n     objections you entertained in 1871 to the proposal to give\r\n     representation to women, and that the course taken by the\r\n     administration over which you preside in assenting to the\r\n     extension of the municipal and school-board franchise to them; in\r\n     calling them to the public functions of candidates and members of\r\n     school-boards; and lastly, of securing the passing of a law which\r\n     renders the process of voting silent and secret, have taken away\r\n     all reasonable grounds for objecting on the score of practical\r\n     inconvenience to the admission of women to the exercise of a\r\n     vote, which they would have to give in precisely the same manner,\r\n     but not nearly so often, as those votes which they already\r\n     deliver.\r\n\r\n     It has been said that there is neither desire nor demand for the\r\n     measure, and further, that women do not care for and would not\r\n     use the suffrage if they possessed it. But the demand for the\r\n     parliamentary franchise is enormously greater than was the demand\r\n     for the municipal franchise, and for the school-board franchise\r\n     there was no apparent call. Yet these two measures were passed\r\n     purely on their own merits, and it was not held to be necessary\r\n     to impose on their promoters, over and above the obligation to\r\n     make out their case, the condition that a majority of the women\r\n     of England or of a particular district should petition for the\r\n     proposed boon. Experience proved the wisdom and justice of this\r\n     course, for although women throughout the country had taken no\r\n     active part in agitating for the municipal franchise, no sooner\r\n     was the privilege accorded than they freely availed themselves of\r\n     it, and statistics obtained from some of the largest boroughs in\r\n     the kingdom show that from the first year that women possessed\r\n     the suffrage, they have voted in about equal proportion with men\r\n     to the number of each on the register. The parliamentary vote is\r\n     more honorable and important than the municipal vote; it is,\r\n     therefore, safe to conclude that women who value and use the\r\n     latter will appreciate and exercise the former as soon as it\r\n     shall be bestowed upon them. Your memorialists submit that great\r\n     injustice and injury are done by debarring these women from a\r\n     voting power which there is such strong presumptive ground for\r\n     believing that they would freely exercise but for the legal\r\n     restraint.\r\n\r\n     Your memorialists are especially moved to call your attention to\r\n     the urgency of the claim at the present time, when a bill\r\n     extending the application of the principle of household suffrage\r\n     is about to be proposed to parliament, which bill received last\r\n     year such expressions of approval from members of her majesty's\r\n     government as to lead to the belief that they are willing to take\r\n     the proposal into serious consideration. They submit that the\r\n     claim and the need for representation of women householders are\r\n     even more pressing than that of agricultural laborers. The\r\n     grievances under which women suffer are equally great, and the\r\n     demand for the franchise has been pressed by a much greater\r\n     number of women and for a much longer period of time than in the\r\n     case of county householders now excluded. The number of persons\r\n     who petitioned last session for the County Franchise bill and for\r\n     the Women's Disabilities bill respectively were, for the former,\r\n     1,889, and for the latter, 329,206. The latter bill has received\r\n     most influential support from both sides of the House, and more\r\n     votes have been recorded in its favor than have been given for\r\n     any bill not directly supported as a party measure by one or\r\n     other of the great parties in the State. Under these\r\n     circumstances your memorialists earnestly request that you will\r\n     use your influence as leader of the House of Commons and of the\r\n     government to secure the passing of the bill introduced by Mr.\r\n     Jacob Bright, either as a substantive enactment, or as an\r\n     integral portion of the next measure that shall be passed dealing\r\n     with the question of the representation of the people.\r\n\r\n     Signed on behalf of the conference,\r\n\r\n                                   CAROLINE M. TAYLOR, _President_.\r\n\r\nThe first vote that was given by the new parliament was on April 7,\r\n1875, Mr. Forsyth having moved the second reading in an able\r\nspeech. It at once became manifest that the question had made great\r\nprogress in the country. In spite of the loss of the seventy\r\nfriends at the preceding general election, our strength in the new\r\nparliament had greatly increased. Including tellers and pairs, 170\r\nvoted for the bill, and only 250 against. This result appears to\r\nhave alarmed our opponents, who proceeded to form an association of\r\npeers, members of parliament and other influential persons, to\r\nresist the claims of women to the suffrage. They issued a circular\r\nwhich will be read by future generations with a smile of\r\namazement.[544]\r\n\r\nIt may have been partly owing to the influence of this association\r\nthat the next year, when Mr. Forsyth again brought forward his\r\nbill, April 26, 1876, although the numbers of our friends and\r\nsupporters remained undiminished, the opponents had considerably\r\nincreased. This was due, also, no doubt, in great degree to the\r\nunexpected attitude taken on this question by the Right Hon. John\r\nBright, the most powerful living advocate for freedom and\r\nrepresentative government. In Mr. Mill's division of 1867, Mr.\r\nBright had voted in favor of the measure, and while his brother had\r\ncharge of the bill, he had never opposed it. His opposition speech\r\nin this debate, therefore, caused extreme disappointment and\r\ndiscouragement. It had little of the force which had always\r\ncharacterized his pleas for political justice. The most eloquent\r\nvoice in the House of Commons lost its magic power when no longer\r\ninspired by truth. The women in the gallery listened with sorrowful\r\nhearts. Though they knew Mr. Bright's opinion could not block the\r\nwheels of progress, yet they felt intense regret that so honored a\r\nfriend to freedom should abandon his most cherished principles when\r\napplied to women.\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary history of the next few years may be very briefly\r\nrecorded. In 1877 the bill had again passed into the hands of our\r\nbeloved leader, Mr. Jacob Bright, who had resumed his place in the\r\nHouse of Commons, as member of parliament for Manchester. After a\r\ndebate of great interest, and while our advocate, Mr. Leonard\r\nCourtney, was speaking, the opponents of the measure burst into a\r\ntumultuous uproar, which effectually drowned his voice. This new\r\nmethod of setting up shouts and howls in place of arguments, has\r\nsince been brought to bear on more than one public question, but it\r\nwas then comparatively novel. Mr. Courtney, nothing daunted, would\r\nnot give way, and when six o'clock, which is the hour for closing\r\nthe debates on Wednesday, struck, it was no longer possible to take\r\na division.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1878, Mr. Jacob Bright was unable from failing\r\nhealth to continue in charge of the bill in the House of Commons,\r\nand a deputation of members from each society waited on Mr.\r\nCourtney and placed it in his hands. June 19, was set for the\r\nsecond reading. In his speech Mr. Courtney dwelt on the benefits\r\nthat may accrue to women from representation. He added:\r\n\r\n     The political reasons for granting the prayer of the bill appear\r\n     to me to be undeniable, but I confess they are not the reasons\r\n     why I most strongly support it. I believe it will develop a\r\n     fuller, freer and nobler character in women by admitting them\r\n     into the sphere of political thought and duty. Some may say, \"But\r\n     what is to be the end?\" I do not know that we are always bound to\r\n     see the goal towards which we are moving. If we are moving on\r\n     right principles; if we are actuated by a feeling of justice; if\r\n     the hand that moves above us and leads us on is a hand in which\r\n     we can place implicit confidence,--then I say, trust to that\r\n     light, follow that hand, without fear of the future.\r\n\r\nThe bill was again lost by 219 votes against 140, thus showing a\r\nsmaller adverse majority than on the last division. This year Mr.\r\nRussell Gurney died. His name will always be associated with the\r\nwomen's suffrage movement, which he had supported ever since Mr.\r\nMill's division in 1867. The death of Lady Anna Gore Langton about\r\nthis time was also a severe loss.\r\n\r\nThe last time that the question was brought before that parliament\r\nwas the following summer, 1870. Mr. Courtney, after taking counsel\r\nwith his parliamentary friends, made an important change in the\r\nconduct of his measure. It had hitherto been brought forward as a\r\nbill, which, if passed, would have made the actual change desired\r\nin the law; as the parliament was now verging towards its close, it\r\nwas thought wiser to test the opinion of the House by bringing the\r\nquestion forward in the form of a resolution. Two purposes were\r\nserved by this change: one was that many men who were in favor of\r\nthe principle of women's suffrage had objected to it when brought\r\nforward as an isolated measure of reform involving a large addition\r\nto the constituency, and possibly therefore a new election; the\r\nother was, that the time for discussion of a private member's bill\r\nis very limited. On Wednesdays, when such bills come on, the House\r\nonly sits in the morning, and the debate must be concluded at a\r\nquarter before six, while the forms of the House afford greater\r\nfacilities for discussing and voting upon motions. Mr. Courtney in\r\na clear and exhaustive speech moved his resolution as follows:\r\n\r\n     That in the opinion of this House it is injurious to the best\r\n     interests of the country that women who are entitled to vote in\r\n     municipal, parochial and school-board elections when possessed of\r\n     the statutory qualifications, should be disabled from voting in\r\n     parliamentary elections, although possessed of the statutory\r\n     qualifications, and that it is expedient that this disability\r\n     should be forthwith repealed.\r\n\r\nThe debate was animated, but the result on division was much the\r\nsame as before: 113 (including tellers and pairs, 144) voting for\r\nit, and 217 (with tellers and pairs, 248) against it. Thus closed\r\nthe ninth parliament of Victoria, as far as women's suffrage was\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThe steady perseverance and unflagging courage of the devoted band\r\nof men and women had achieved victories at many points along the\r\nline of attack.[545] Every suffrage meeting was the means of\r\ngaining converts. The agitation for the suffrage kept the memory of\r\nwomen's wrongs and grievances fresh before the public mind. These\r\nyears saw the medical profession legally thrown open to women, and\r\nfacilities given them in school and hospital for obtaining that\r\neducation which had been hitherto sought abroad. Pharmacy no longer\r\nexcluded them. London University opened its gates. The Irish\r\nIntermediate Education bill, in 1878, which was originally\r\nintroduced for boys only, was, after several energetic discussions,\r\nwidened, so as to include girls. Women began to be elected as\r\npoor-law guardians. A Scotch Married Women's Property bill was\r\npassed, which was a great improvement on the former law. A\r\nMatrimonial Causes Amendment act was also carried, which enables\r\nmagistrates to grant a judicial separation to wives who are\r\nbrutally treated, along with a maintenance for their children. Some\r\nof our friends regretted that these side issues should absorb the\r\ntime of those who might otherwise have been working exclusively for\r\nsuffrage; but this was a short-sighted fear. By broadening the\r\nbasis of work, by asking simultaneously for better laws, better\r\neducation, better employments and wider fields of usefulness, the\r\nsympathies of more women were engaged; while underlying and\r\nsupporting all was the steady agitation for the suffrage with its\r\ncompact organization of committees, meetings, publications and\r\npetitions which kept parliament awake to the fact that though still\r\ndisfranchised, women had claims which it could not afford to\r\nignore.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Priscilla Bright McLaren]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was a time when the agitation for the suffrage had apparently\r\nreached a stationary condition, neither advancing nor receding, in\r\nwhich it was destined to remain for some years longer. Other\r\ncauses, as the abolition of West Indian slavery and the corn laws,\r\nhave had a similar period of apparent torpor succeeding the first\r\nactivity. Justin McCarthy in his \"History of our own Times,\" says:\r\n\r\n     This is, from whatever cause, a very common phenomenon in our\r\n     political history. A movement which began with the promise of\r\n     sweeping all before it, seems to lose all its force, and is\r\n     supposed by many observers to be now only the care of a few\r\n     earnest and fanatical men. Suddenly it is taken up by a minister\r\n     of commanding influence, and the bore or the crotchet of one\r\n     parliament is the great party controversy of a second, and the\r\n     accomplished triumph of a third.\r\n\r\nDuring the year of 1879, it was thought desirable to ascertain by\r\nsome practical test what were the various reasons which caused\r\nthinking women to wish for the suffrage; and letters were addressed\r\nto ladies who were eminent either in literature or art, or who were\r\nfollowing scientific or professional careers, or were engaged in\r\nany form of philanthropic work. The answers that were returned were\r\ncollected into a pamphlet of exceeding interest, which was sent to\r\neach member before the debate, and it was amazing to watch from the\r\ngallery how the little green pamphlet was consulted and quoted\r\nfrom, in the most opposite quarters of the House, by friends who\r\nsought fresh arguments from it or by enemies who were looking for\r\nsome sentence on which to base a sarcasm.[546]\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of these letters Miss Frances Power Cobbe said:\r\n\r\n     So far from the truth is the reiterated statement of certain\r\n     honorable members of parliament that women do not desire the\r\n     franchise, that in my large experience I have scarcely ever known\r\n     a woman possessed of ordinary common sense, and who had lived\r\n     some years alone in the world, who did not earnestly wish for it.\r\n     The women who gratify these gentlemen by smilingly deprecating\r\n     any such responsibilities, are those who have dwelt since they\r\n     were born in well-feathered nests, and have never needed to do\r\n     anything but open their soft beaks for the choicest little grubs\r\n     to be dropped into them. It is utterly absurd (and I am afraid\r\n     the members of parliament in question are quite aware they are\r\n     talking nonsense) to argue from the contented squawks of a brood\r\n     of these callow creatures, that full grown swallows and larks\r\n     have no need of wings, and are always happiest when their pinions\r\n     are broken.\r\n\r\nThe production of this pamphlet marked an era in women's suffrage\r\nliterature. It was impossible after this to doubt that a large body\r\nof thinking women, not the queens of society, but the women who\r\nwrote, read, thought, or worked, were in favor of having full\r\nadmission to political rights and responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe chief work of the society had now crystallized into five or six\r\ngreat centres. Edinburgh, under the presidency of Mrs. McLaren,\r\nassisted by Miss Wigham and Miss Kirkland, treasurer and secretary,\r\nwas the recognized centre of activity for Scotland. In Ireland\r\nthere was a committee in Dublin, of which Mrs. Haslam is the most\r\nactive member; and the North of Ireland Committee, led by Miss\r\nIsabella Tod.[547] The three principal associations in England were\r\nthose of London,[548] including the east and north-east counties;\r\nManchester,[549] taking charge of the north of England and Wales,\r\nand Bristol[550] looking after the West. The officers of the\r\nseveral committees of the three kingdoms form a National Central\r\nCommittee which has its headquarters in London and superintends all\r\nof the work bearing specially upon the action of parliament.\r\n\r\nPetitions were still sent in, but no longer in such enormous\r\nnumbers. It had become evident that parliament cared little for a\r\nlong roll of names from the unrepresented classes; they were now\r\nchiefly collected as a means of discovering how public opinion\r\nstood in any particular district. For instance, in 1879, a petition\r\nwas sent from 1,447 women householders of Leicester. The total\r\nnumber of women householders in this town was 2,610, of whom only\r\n1,991 could be applied to, and there is no reason to suppose that\r\npublic opinion was more advanced in Leicester than in the majority\r\nof large manufacturing towns.\r\n\r\nThe municipal elections occur in England every November, and our\r\ncustom in some towns was to call meetings of the women householders\r\nin every ward in which there was a contest, to explain to them the\r\nresponsibilities resting upon the voters, and after an earnest\r\naddress from some one of the ladies, to invite the respective\r\ncandidates to speak. By these means not only was the interest of\r\nthe women awakened in local politics, but the candidates themselves\r\nwere reminded of the interests of an important section of their\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of 1880, came again the promise of a reform\r\nbill. The majority of the Liberal members of the House of Commons\r\nhad pledged themselves to their constituents in its favor. But as\r\nour enemies were still reiterating that women themselves did not\r\ncare for the franchise, some further proof of their sympathy was in\r\norder. The first great demonstration in favor of women was held in\r\nFree Trade Hall, Manchester, which seats about 5,000 people,\r\nFebruary 3, where women were admitted free, and seats reserved for\r\nmen in the gallery at 2s. 6d. each. This arrangement was adopted to\r\nmake it a meeting of women. One hundred gentlemen were present\r\nbesides the reporters.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the demonstration had been explained at preliminary\r\nward meetings to which men and women came in crowds. On the night\r\nin question the scene exceeded the most sanguine expectations.\r\nThose who had witnessed the great free trade gatherings which\r\nassembled to hear Charles Villiers, Richard Cobden and John Bright,\r\nnever saw a more enthusiastic audience. Mrs. Duncan McLaren of\r\nEdinburgh, who had been invited to preside, took her seat followed\r\nby an array of distinguished women, such as had never before graced\r\nany platform in the history of the three kingdoms, while the vast\r\narea and galleries were crowded with women of wealth and culture;\r\nfactory women, shop-keepers and hard toilers of every station were\r\nalso there. Some had walked twenty miles to attend that great\r\nmeeting. They sat on the steps of the platform, climbed on every\r\ncoigne of vantage, stood in dense masses in every aisle and corner.\r\nA large over-flow meeting was also held in the neighboring Memorial\r\nHall over which Mrs. Lucas presided, but even this could not\r\naccommodate all who came, and thousands went away disappointed. It\r\nwas truly a marvelous meeting, grand in its numbers, grand in the\r\nenthusiasm which had brought so many thousands together unattracted\r\nby the names of any distinguished speakers, to sympathize with\r\neach other in a great national movement, and to proclaim unity of\r\naction until it was gained; and it was grand also in the\r\nimpressiveness of the words that were uttered. The president in her\r\nclear grave tones which were heard in the breathless stillness over\r\nthat large assembly, said:\r\n\r\n     It seems like a dream. But only a grave reality could have\r\n     brought so many women together. Need we wonder that the\r\n     beneficent designs of Providence have been so imperfectly carried\r\n     out when only one-half the intellect and heart of the nation have\r\n     hitherto been called into action, and the powers of the other\r\n     half have been almost wholly suppressed? Women are learning along\r\n     with good men that politics in the true sense has to do with\r\n     human interests at large.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. McLaren had concluded, one speaker after another, gave\r\nher special testimony in favor of the necessity of obtaining\r\nrepresentation. The number was so great that no one was allowed\r\nmore than ten minutes.[551]\r\n\r\nThis demonstration was quickly followed by others that were every\r\nway as successful. In connection with one at St. James' Hall,\r\nLondon, over which Viscountess Harberton presided, a procession of\r\nworking women marched through the streets with a banner on which\r\nwas inscribed \"We're far too low to vote the tax; we're not too low\r\nto pay.\" Here also an overflow meeting was held to accommodate the\r\nnumbers that could not be admitted into the hall. On November 4,\r\nthe same scene was repeated at the Colston Hall, Bristol, and Mrs.\r\nBeddoe, the wife of a popular physician in that city presided, and\r\non November 11, the last demonstration of that year was convened in\r\nthe Albert Hall, Nottingham, where Mrs. Lucas took the chair. The\r\nfollowing year saw no relaxation in these efforts. The Birmingham\r\ndemonstration took place on February 22, 1881. It was a most\r\ninclement night and great fears had been entertained that it would\r\nprove a failure, but nothing had power to keep the crowds of women\r\naway or to lessen their enthusiasm. Mrs. Crosskey, the wife of Dr.\r\nCrosskey, one of the most respected of the Birmingham Liberal\r\nleaders, presided. The next was in St. George's Hall, Bradford, on\r\nNovember 22, and here again Mrs. McLaren took the chair, and said:\r\n\r\n     We are here to-night in the spirit of self-sacrifice. We have had\r\n     our sorrows in working on this question. We are here because we\r\n     know there are on our statute books unjust laws which subject\r\n     many women to sorrow and suffering, and the fact that we have\r\n     worked our way to such a platform proves that women are capable\r\n     of holding a political position, and ought to have a voice in our\r\n     national affairs. We cannot rest contented under the\r\n     consciousness of injustice because there are women who accept it\r\n     as their natural condition. We feel it our duty to arouse our sex\r\n     everywhere to a sense of their high destiny. The inspiration for\r\n     this work has come from a higher source than ourselves, and we\r\n     have had often to feel that God does not leave his children to\r\n     fight their battles alone.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 there were two more demonstrations. The first was in Albert\r\nHall, Sheffield, on February 27, Lady Harberton presiding, and it\r\nwas crowded to overflowing with women of all ranks and conditions\r\nof society. The demonstration at Glasgow was on November 3, and no\r\nway inferior to the other in brilliancy and interest.[552]\r\n\r\nThese demonstrations conclusively proved that the suffrage is\r\ndesired, not only by a few educated women, the leaders of the\r\nmovement, but by the great masses of the hard-working women. They\r\nproved also woman's political capacity and organizing power. No\r\nbody of persons could possibly do more to manifest their desire for\r\npolitical liberty than the women who have organized and attended\r\nthese demonstrations. So far as I am aware no such meetings\r\nhave been attempted by the agricultural laborers over whose\r\nenfranchisement the House of Commons has been so deeply exercised,\r\nand though the absence of interest which these classes of men have\r\nas a whole shown in the question of the franchise is no argument\r\nfor depriving them of it, the political knowledge and aspirations\r\nthat women have shown for more than fifteen years ought to count\r\nfor something in establishing their claim.\r\n\r\nThe session of 1880 was broken, and the dissolution of parliament\r\nin March, the general election which followed, the change in the\r\ngovernment and the consequent press of public affairs, made it\r\nimpossible to bring forward any measure for the suffrage, but the\r\nprinciple was most splendidly and triumphantly vindicated in the\r\nancient kingdom of the Isle of Man which has an independent\r\ngovernment dating from the time of its first colonization under the\r\nvikings. It has in modern times its elective house which is called\r\nthe House of Keys and is equivalent to the Commons. Its Upper House\r\nconsists of the attorney-general, the clerk of the rolls, the\r\nbishop, two judges (or deemsters) and other officials. It enacts\r\nits own laws and imposes its own taxes, but is subject to imperial\r\ncontrol by requiring the sanction of the queen before any law can\r\ncome into effect. Some few years ago the franchise was felt to be\r\ntoo restricted, and a movement was set on foot which culminated in\r\n1880 in a bill to extend the franchise to every male person who was\r\na householder. Mr. Richard Sherwood, who five years previously had\r\nbrought forward a similar motion, moved an amendment to omit the\r\nword \"male\" for the purpose of extending the franchise to women who\r\npossessed the requisite qualification, which was carried by 16 to\r\n3, a vote of two-thirds of the whole body of the House of Keys. It\r\nthen went before the Council which refused the franchise to female\r\noccupiers and lodgers, though agreeing to give it to all female\r\nowners of real estate of L4 annual value. Thus modified the bill\r\nwas sent back to the House of Keys which gave up the lodger\r\nfranchise but adhered to that for occupiers. The bill thus altered\r\nwas again sent back to the Council and again returned with a\r\nmessage that the Council refused to come to an agreement. The Keys\r\nthen proposed a compromise, limiting the qualification to woman\r\noccupiers of L20 a year. This again was refused, and the Council\r\nwere prepared to reject the bill altogether. Sooner than lose the\r\nwhole, the Keys assented, signing, however, a protest in which they\r\nstated that they had complied simply to secure a part of a just\r\nprinciple rather than lose the whole. The act was signed by the\r\ngovernor, the Keys and the Council on December 21, received the\r\nroyal assent on January 5, 1881, and was immediately afterwards,\r\naccording to ancient custom, proclaimed as law on the Tynwald Hill.\r\n\r\nFully to estimate this victory, it must be remembered that the vote\r\nthus gained is the complete parliamentary franchise. Though the\r\ntotal area of the island is so small and though only those women\r\nwho were absolutely owners of property were enfranchised, they\r\nnumbered about 700. The law came into operation immediately, and\r\nthe election began March 21. The women voted in considerable\r\nnumbers, and were, as an eye-witness states, without exception\r\nquite intelligent and business like in this procedure. At the\r\npolling stations, the first persons who recorded their votes were\r\nwomen. We may mention in proof of their political gratitude that in\r\nthe district where Mr. Sherwood was one of the candidates, every\r\nwoman, whatever her party, voted for his reelection.\r\n\r\nJust before the opening of parliament in 1881, Mr. Courtney\r\naccepted a position in the administration, which rendered it\r\nimpossible for him to continue in charge of any independent\r\nmeasure. By his advice, application was made to Mr. Hugh Mason,\r\nmember for Ashton under Lyme. But the state of public business\r\nduring the session never permitted the resolution to be discussed.\r\nThe same disappointment occurred in the session of 1882--the\r\ndifficulties in Ireland and Egypt occupying the attention of the\r\ngovernment and the country to an extent which almost precluded any\r\nmeasure of domestic reform. Nevertheless, by constant and arduous\r\nefforts, these two years witnessed the passing of the Municipal\r\nFranchise bill for Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe Municipal Franchise act of 1869 applied to English women only.\r\nEarly in the session of 1881, Dr. Cameron, member for Glasgow,\r\nintroduced a bill to assimilate the position of Scottish women to\r\nthat which their English sisters had enjoyed for twelve years. The\r\nbill passed the House of Commons before Easter, and was then\r\nbrought forward in the House of Lords by the Earl of Camperdown,\r\npassed May 13, and received the royal assent June 3. This law\r\napplied only to women rate-payers of the royal and parliamentary\r\nburghs, and did not extend to the police burghs, the populous\r\nplaces endowed with powers of local self-government under the\r\ngeneral Police and Improvement act of 1862. A request was sent to\r\nMr. Cameron to exert himself for a similar extension of the\r\nfranchise to the women of the police burghs, and he answered by\r\nintroducing in the following year, 1882, another act which gave to\r\nall women rate-payers the right, not merely of voting at elections\r\nof burgh commissioners, but also of voting with the other\r\ninhabitants as to whether a populous place should be constituted a\r\npolice burgh.\r\n\r\nThe election under these new measures was in November, 1882, and\r\nthen Scottish women voted for the first time, excepting of course\r\nin school-board elections. The result was entirely satisfactory,\r\nthough the number of women who voted varied greatly--in some places\r\nwhere no special interest attached to the election none came to\r\nvote, while in others they voted in equal proportion with the men,\r\nand in a few towns nearly every woman whose name was on the\r\nregister voted. The passing of these two franchise bills was an\r\nundoubted triumph of the women's suffrage party. As one of the\r\nopponents in the debate of July, 1883, scornfully observed, \"Had it\r\nnot been for the question of women's suffrage being agitated\r\nthroughout the country at the time, we should not have heard a\r\nsyllable of the Scottish women's franchise bill,\" a sneering\r\nadmission which we willingly construe into compliment.\r\n\r\nThe year 1882 also witnessed the passing of the Married Women's\r\nProperty act, whose immense benefits can hardly be estimated, and\r\nwe may confidently assert that but for the unceasing agitation of\r\nthe friends of women's suffrage, another quarter of a century would\r\nhave been suffered to pass without bringing in this tardy measure\r\nof justice.[553]\r\n\r\nWe now come to the session of 1883, inoperative as far as actual\r\nlegislation was concerned, but rich in its augury for the future.\r\nAlready in April the improved temper of the House on questions in\r\nwhich women were concerned, had been shown by the brilliant\r\nmajority that voted with the Rt. Hon. Mr. Stansfeld for the\r\nsuppression of the Contagious Diseases acts which have so long\r\nstained the English statute book. Early in May a memorial to Mr.\r\nGladstone was signed by 110 Liberal members of parliament,\r\nunconnected with the government, in which they stated:\r\n\r\n     That in the opinion of your memorialists no measure for the\r\n     assimilation of the county and borough franchise will be\r\n     satisfactory unless it contain provisions for extending the\r\n     suffrage without distinction of sex to all persons who possess\r\n     the statutory qualifications for the parliamentary franchise.\r\n\r\nThis memorial was a most remarkable manifestation of the support\r\nwhich members on the Liberal side of the House are pledged to give\r\nto the principle of justice to women. Nor are we wanting in\r\nConservative support. Sir Stafford Northcote, has always given his\r\nfriendly approval to the movement, and has very recently repeated\r\nhis assurances of cooeperation in answer to a deputation of ladies\r\nwho waited on him. After repeated balloting, Mr. Mason obtained a\r\nday, July 6, on which to bring forward his resolution. It was thus\r\nworded:\r\n\r\n     That in the opinion of this House the parliamentary franchise\r\n     should be extended to women who possess the qualifications which\r\n     entitle men to vote, and who, in all matters of local government\r\n     have the right of voting.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Leatham, also a Liberal, gave notice to oppose the\r\nresolution affirming with a curious liberalism, that \"it is\r\nundesirable to change the immemorial basis of the franchise, which\r\nis that men only shall be qualified to elect members to serve in\r\nthis House.\" Thus after a silence of four years, years of apparent\r\ninertia, but really fraught with progress, the debate once again\r\nrevived in parliament. Mr. Jacob Bright said:\r\n\r\n     They have told us women can get what they want without the\r\n     franchise. That used to be said of working men--but since they\r\n     have had a vote, members in every part of the House have had a\r\n     generosity and sympathy and courage in all matters affecting\r\n     working men which they never had before. Precisely the same\r\n     effect would follow if you gave women the franchise. I admit that\r\n     women have gained much without the franchise, and I will tell the\r\n     House when that gain began: It began with the introduction of the\r\n     question of women's suffrage to the House, and the gain has been\r\n     mainly due to the awakening intelligence of women on political\r\n     questions owing to the wide-spread agitation and the demand for\r\n     women's suffrage. They have gained without the franchise,\r\n     municipal votes, school-board votes, the right to sit on\r\n     school-boards, the magnificent act of last year--an act which\r\n     ought to confer lasting fame on the present lord chancellor--the\r\n     Married Women's Property act. And owing to the untiring energy of\r\n     the right honorable member for Halifax (Mr. Stansfeld), they have\r\n     succeeded in inflicting a blow on an act of parliament[554] more\r\n     unjust to women than anything which has ever been passed, a blow\r\n     from which that act will never recover. These things have been\r\n     gained without the franchise. But who will tell me they would not\r\n     have gained them sooner, with less heart-breaking labor, if they\r\n     had had the political franchise?\r\n\r\nMr. Courtney also addressed the House in stirring words. The result\r\nwas most encouraging. Four years had passed since a division had\r\nbeen taken, and the enormous majority against us which in so many\r\ndivisions had maintained its strength had dwindled to only 16. A\r\ntotal of 164, including tellers and pairs supported the resolution\r\nagainst an opposition of only 180. If the Liberal side of the House\r\nhad only been canvassed on this occasion it would have been a\r\nvictory, as 119 Liberals voted for it and paired, and only 75\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nWith the close of the session the question was transferred to the\r\ncountry, and the events of the autumn made it amply evident that\r\nthe majority of Liberals were in favor of extending the\r\nparliamentary suffrage to women. A great conference was held in\r\nOctober at Leeds, where delegates from between 500 and 600 Liberal\r\norganizations were present. Fully 2,000 delegates were present at\r\nthe first meeting. After a long discussion upon the coming Reform\r\nbill, the Rev. T. Crosskey, of Birmingham, proposed a rider to the\r\nresolution which would include women's suffrage, as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That, in order to meet the just expectations of the\r\n     country, and to fulfill the pledges given at the last general\r\n     election, this conference is of opinion that a measure for the\r\n     extension of the franchise should confer on householders in the\r\n     counties the same electoral rights as those enjoyed by\r\n     householders in parliamentary boroughs; _and that, in the opinion\r\n     of this meeting, any measure for the extension of the suffrage\r\n     should confer the franchise upon women, who, possessing the\r\n     qualifications which entitle men to vote, have now the right of\r\n     voting in all matters of local government_.\r\n\r\nMr. Walter McLaren seconded Dr. Crosskey in an able speech, and\r\nMiss Jane Cobden (daughter of the late Richard Cobden) who was\r\nsitting on the platform, and who had been appointed delegate from\r\nthe Liberal association of Midhurst, supported the resolution. She\r\nbegged them, representing as they did the Liberal principles of all\r\nEngland, to give it their hearty support. This was a continuation\r\nof the struggle in which Liberals had taken part during the last\r\nfifty years, and she trusted they would be true to their\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nMrs. Helen Bright Clark, the daughter of Mr. John Bright, M. P.,\r\nwho had been appointed delegate from one of the few Liberal\r\nassociations which comprise women among their members, said:\r\n\r\n     There was in this country a considerable and increasing number of\r\n     earnest women of strong liberal convictions, who felt keenly the\r\n     total exclusion of their sex from the parliamentary suffrage.\r\n     Their hope was, of course, in the Liberal party, though all of\r\n     its members were not yet converted to true liberalism. The\r\n     Liberal women would not rest satisfied until there was throughout\r\n     the United Kingdom a real and honest household suffrage. They\r\n     knew that they were weak in the cabinet, and they regretted to\r\n     know that some of the most eminent leaders of the Liberal party\r\n     were not in this matter wholly their friends. These leaders had\r\n     fears which she thought the future would show to have been\r\n     unfounded. But she could venture to say on behalf of the Liberal\r\n     women of England that they were not unmindful of the past, and\r\n     were not ungrateful for the services which these men rendered and\r\n     were prepared to render to their country. Women were grateful.\r\n     They sympathized with the efforts of Liberal statesmen in the\r\n     past, and they knew how faithfully and loyally to follow. But\r\n     they felt that they must sometimes originate for themselves, and\r\n     they dared not blindly and with absolute faith follow any man,\r\n     however great or however justly and deeply beloved. Further, she\r\n     could say that, with the result of the high political teaching\r\n     they had had in the past, they would endeavor faithfully,\r\n     intelligently and with what ability was given to them, to uphold\r\n     those great principles of justice, and trust in the people which\r\n     she believed had made the Liberal party what it was, and which\r\n     alone were capable of lifting it to the highest triumphs in the\r\n     future.\r\n\r\nThere were enthusiastic cheers when Mrs. Clark had finished\r\nspeaking. The historical interest, the self-evident justice of the\r\nplea brought forward by the daughters of the great reform leaders\r\non behalf of the continuance of the grand cause of freedom for\r\nwhich their fathers had so bravely battled, went to the hearts of\r\nthe crowded assembly. Delegates who had come determined to vote\r\nagainst the resolution--the \"monstrous political fad,\" as one of\r\nour opponents in parliament had called it--said, almost with tears\r\nin their eyes, \"We can't vote against the daughters of Bright and\r\nCobden,\" and when the resolution with the rider was put, a forest\r\nof hands went up in its support, and in that vast crowd there were\r\nonly about thirty dissentients. The following evening Miss Jane\r\nCobden and Mrs. Scatcherd addressed an open-air meeting of 30,000\r\nmen who could not gain access to Victoria Hall, where John Bright\r\nwas speaking on the franchise for men, and a unanimous cheer was\r\ngiven in favor of women's suffrage.\r\n\r\nThis was only the beginning of the autumn campaign among the\r\nLiberal associations. The general committee of the Edinburgh United\r\nLiberal Association met on November 16, 1883, in the Oddfellows'\r\nHall (No. 2), Forrest road, Edinburgh, to consider the questions of\r\nthe Local Government Board (Scotland) bill, the equalization of the\r\nburgh and county franchise, and the extension of the parliamentary\r\nvote to women householders. After the two first subjects had been\r\nconsidered, the following resolution, moved by ex-Bailie Lewis, was\r\nadopted:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That this meeting regards the extension of the\r\n     parliamentary franchise to female householders as just and\r\n     reasonable, and would hail with satisfaction the introduction of\r\n     a government measure which would confer the parliamentary\r\n     franchise upon all female householders, whether resident in\r\n     counties or burghs.\r\n\r\nNovember 21, a meeting of the general council of the Manchester\r\nLiberal Association was held in the Memorial Hall to consider the\r\nresolutions passed at the Leeds conference. Mr. J. A. Beith\r\npresided. Mr. J. W. Southern moved the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That in order to meet the just expectation of the\r\n     country and to fulfill the pledges given at the last general\r\n     election, this council is of opinion that a measure for the\r\n     extension of the franchise should confer on householders and\r\n     lodgers in the counties the same electoral rights as those\r\n     enjoyed by householders and lodgers in parliamentary boroughs,\r\n     and should extend to Ireland the franchise enjoyed by Great\r\n     Britain; and that, in the opinion of this meeting, any measure\r\n     for the extension of the suffrage should confer the franchise\r\n     upon women who, possessing the qualifications which should\r\n     entitle men to vote, have now the right of voting in all matters\r\n     of local government.\r\n\r\nAn amendment to strike out the portion relating to women having\r\nbeen rejected, the resolution was carried unanimously. November 26,\r\nthe sixth annual meeting of the National Liberal Association was\r\nheld at Bristol. Here also one or two ladies were present as\r\ndelegates. After a resolution affirming the urgency of the question\r\nof parliamentary reform had been passed, Mr. Lewis Fry, M. P.,\r\nmoved:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That in the opinion of this meeting any measure for\r\n     the extension of the suffrage should confer the franchise upon\r\n     women who, possessing the qualifications which entitle men to\r\n     vote, have now the right of voting in all matters of local\r\n     government.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was seconded by Dr. Caldicott, supported in\r\nexcellent speeches by Mrs. Walter McLaren and Mrs. Ashworth\r\nHallett, and carried by a majority of five. Many other Liberal\r\nassociations of less importance, during the autumn, affirmed the\r\nprinciple of women's suffrage. All the political associations in\r\nUlster, both Conservative and Liberal, either formally or\r\ninformally signified their acceptance of the principle. In the\r\nprogress of the movement it was very encouraging to see so many\r\nbrave women[555] of ability crowding our platform, conscientiously\r\ndevoting their time, talents and money to this sacred cause, ready\r\nand able to fill the vacant places that time must make in our\r\nranks.\r\n\r\nThe year 1884 opened with good hopes. There was the immediate\r\nprospect of a reform bill, intended so to widen the representation\r\nof the people as to fix it on a satisfactory basis for another\r\ngeneration at least. The time seemed opportune for the attainment\r\nof women's suffrage. There had been repeated proof that the\r\nmajority of the Liberal party in the country admit the justice of\r\ntheir claims; there were renewed promises of support on the part of\r\nmembers of parliament of all shades of political opinion. Many\r\ntimes the claims of women for the franchise have been set aside by\r\nthe assertion that so important a privilege could not be granted\r\ntill the time came for the general re-settlement of the question.\r\nThat time appeared to have come. A considerable extension of the\r\nsuffrage was to be granted, so as to include another 2,000,000 of\r\nunenfranchised men; what better time to recognize the claims of\r\nwomen who already possessed the qualifications of property or\r\nresidence which alone in England give the vote? A few persons\r\nexpected that the government Reform bill would contain a clause\r\nrelating to women, but this expectation was not generally shared.\r\nIt was well known that strong differences of opinion existed in the\r\ncabinet which would render it well-nigh impossible for the\r\ngovernment to introduce the question as one of their own; and\r\nthough there may have been disappointment, there was no great\r\nsurprise when the Franchise bill, on its introduction, was found to\r\ncontain no reference to women.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there had been a change in the leadership of the\r\nmovement. Mr. Hugh Mason having intimated his intention to resign\r\nthe conduct of the measure, Mr. William Woodall, member of\r\nparliament for Stoke-on-Trent, consented to take charge of it. A\r\nconference of friendly members of parliament was held in the House\r\nof Commons on February 7, and it was then agreed that should the\r\ngovernment Franchise bill not extend to women, an amendment with\r\nthe object of including them should be moved at some stage of the\r\ndiscussion in the House of Commons. Mr. Woodall agreed to take\r\ncharge of this amendment.\r\n\r\nOn February 28, Mr. Gladstone moved in the House of Commons for\r\nleave to bring in a bill to amend the representation of the people.\r\nThe forms of the House did not admit of Mr. Woodall's amendment\r\nbeing placed on the notice-paper until after the second reading of\r\nthe bill, but during the adjourned debate on the second reading he\r\nfound an opportunity to announce that he would move his proposed\r\nclause while the House was in committee on the bill. He remarked\r\nthat the fundamental principle of the bill as it was described by\r\nthe prime minister was to give a vote to every household, but as\r\nthere was no provision for giving the franchise to such\r\nhouseholders if they happened to be women, he intended to propose\r\nthe insertion of a clause to remedy this omission. The clause was:\r\n\r\n     For all purposes connected with and having reference to the right\r\n     of voting in the election of members of parliament, words in the\r\n     Representation of the People acts importing the masculine gender\r\n     include women.\r\n\r\nA careful analysis of the opinions of members of the House of\r\nCommons gave every promise that such an amendment might be\r\nsuccessful. The views of 485 out of the entire number were known,\r\nwhile 155 had never expressed an opinion, about one-third of these\r\nbeing new members. Of those whose opinions were known, 249, or a\r\nmajority, had expressed themselves in favor of women's suffrage,\r\n236 had expressed themselves against it. The preponderance of\r\nsupport had hitherto always been among the Liberal ranks, for\r\nthough the leaders of the Conservative party had given the\r\nprinciple their hearty approval, their example had not been\r\nfollowed by their partisans. It appeared probable therefore that,\r\nif the government held itself neutral on the occasion and permitted\r\nfair play, the amendment would be carried mainly by means of their\r\nown friends.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring, meetings of considerable importance were held in\r\nthe country. The first was at Edinburgh on March 22. It was a\r\ndemonstration of women inferior in no respect to those we have had\r\noccasion to chronicle of former years. No more imposing assemblage\r\nfor a political object had ever been seen in Edinburgh. The largest\r\nhall in the city--that of the United Presbyterian Synod--was\r\ncrowded to the doors, and an overflow meeting was held in the\r\nPresbytery Hall. Banners were hung above the platform and a roll\r\ninscribed with the names of the principal supporters of the\r\nmovement was conspicuously displayed.[556] Lady Harberton occupied\r\nthe chair and was accompanied by the delegates.[557] Letters[558]\r\nof sympathy were read by Miss Wigham, the secretary.\r\n\r\n     LADY HARBERTON said: If our legislators say taxation and\r\n     representation should go together, it is right that they should\r\n     give expression to this opinion fairly and openly, and at all\r\n     times and seasons insist upon it that those women who are\r\n     ratepayers and who are in fact heads of households, ought not to\r\n     be excluded from the privilege of voting for a member to\r\n     represent them in the House of Commons. This is no question of\r\n     women usurping the place of men or any trivialities of that kind;\r\n     it is a much more serious matter. The exclusion of women from the\r\n     right to representation has already led to laws being passed\r\n     about them and their interests, that I do not hesitate to call a\r\n     disgrace to humanity. [Cheers.] That they are not more commonly\r\n     recognized as such is due, I think, to two causes. One thing is\r\n     that women of the upper classes, who are usually wealthy, are\r\n     able by the aid of money so to hedge themselves around with\r\n     barriers to oppose the inconveniences placed upon women by the\r\n     laws, that they very often do not feel them so much; while women\r\n     of the classes who are not wealthy are so crushed and oppressed\r\n     by the working of these laws that they are unable to take the\r\n     first step, which is agitation, towards getting them altered or\r\n     repealed. [Cheers.] It often seems to me that another reason why\r\n     women themselves are not more enthusiastic upon this question of\r\n     the franchise is, that from their earliest childhood they are\r\n     taught that the first duty of women is unselfishness, the putting\r\n     of their own interests and wishes behind those of others. Any\r\n     discussion of this great question only brings forth hysterical\r\n     clamor that \"women should stay at Home\"--with a very big \"H.\"\r\n     [Laughter and cheers.] Well, I have been examining a little into\r\n     the conduct of those ladies who do stay at home so much, and what\r\n     do I find? Why, that they rush about and seem like the changing\r\n     colors of the kaleidoscope, now collecting at a bazaar, anon\r\n     singing at a concert, with no end of publicity [cheers], but as\r\n     long as no rational object is promoted by their action, it is all\r\n     counted as staying quietly home in the nursery, whether they have\r\n     children or not. That is their notion of being \"thoroughly\r\n     domesticated.\" [Laughter.] Now, much as I could wish myself that\r\n     men had done their duty and agitated for us, in this case it is\r\n     an undeniable fact that they have not shown that readiness, I may\r\n     say eagerness, to begin that one could have wished; it therefore\r\n     changes at once into one of those duties men have not seen their\r\n     way to do, and so becomes of necessity women's work.\r\n\r\nA series of meetings[559] after this was held in Bath, Newcastle\r\nand London.\r\n\r\nThe audiences heartily concurred with the speakers that the time\r\nwhen a reform bill was before parliament was the fittest and most\r\nopportune moment in which to press forward the claim of women to\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nWe may observe once again with pride, how hearty and cheering have\r\nalways been the sympathy and assistance that men have rendered to\r\nwomen in this movement in England. At no time has there been a\r\npossibility of a feeling of bitterness between the sexes or a\r\nconviction that their interests were antagonistic, for the plain\r\nreason that there have always been men working side by side with\r\nwomen. Our suffrage meetings have been attended and supported by\r\npolitical leaders, members of parliament, town councils or\r\nprominent movers among the working-class associations. Except in\r\nthe great demonstrations, which for special reasons were confined\r\nexclusively to women, our movement has formed part of the ordinary\r\npolitical life of the country.\r\n\r\nThe _Suffrage Journal_ for May contains a very carefully drawn\r\ncalculation of the number of women in the United Kingdom who will\r\nprobably receive the franchise if the wider qualifications\r\ncontained in the present Franchise bill become law. It must be\r\nremembered that there are now 3,330,720 more houses than electors\r\nin the British Isles. In boroughs where household suffrage already\r\nprevails for men, the unrepresented houses should guide us to a\r\ntolerably correct estimate of the number of women householders. We\r\nmay say that practically there are 446,000 houses in the boroughs\r\nof England and Wales, whose inhabitant in each case being a woman,\r\nis unrepresented. The proportion varies much in different\r\nlocalities; in the city of Bath one-fourth the householders are\r\nwomen. If we calculate that one house in every six in the boroughs\r\nis occupied by a woman, we find that 349,746 is the probable number\r\nto be enfranchised there.\r\n\r\nFor the counties there are no means of arriving at so close a\r\nresult, but by estimating the proportion of women householders to\r\nbe the same as that of women land-owners, or one in seven, we reach\r\nthe fairly approximate calculation of 390,434, in the counties. The\r\nsame method of calculation applies to Scotland and to Ireland,\r\nwhere, however, the proportion of woman land-owners is one in\r\neight.[560]\r\n\r\nIn order to show that the desire for the suffrage was not confined\r\nto any one rank, class or profession of women, a circular was\r\nsigned by a large number of ladies and sent to every member of both\r\nhouses of parliament. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n     SIR: We desire to call your attention to the claim of women who\r\n     are heads of households to be included in the operation of the\r\n     government Franchise bill.\r\n\r\n     Women have continuously presented this claim before parliament\r\n     and the country since the Reform bill of 1867. The introduction\r\n     of a measure declared by the government to be intended to deal\r\n     with the franchise in an exhaustive manner, renders it especially\r\n     necessary now to urge it upon the attention of parliament.\r\n\r\n     We respectfully represent that the claim of duly qualified women\r\n     for admission within the pale of the constitution is fully as\r\n     pressing as that of the agricultural laborer, and that the body\r\n     of electors who would thereby be added to the constituencies,\r\n     would be at least equal in general and political intelligence to\r\n     the great body of agricultural and other laborers who are to be\r\n     enfranchised by the government bill.\r\n\r\n     Among this body would be found women land-owners, who form\r\n     one-seventh of the land proprietors of the country; women of\r\n     means and position living on their own property; schoolmistresses\r\n     and other teachers; women engaged in professional, literary and\r\n     artistic pursuits; women farmers, merchants, manufacturers and\r\n     shopkeepers; besides large numbers of self-supporting women\r\n     engaged in industrial occupations. The continued exclusion of so\r\n     large a proportion of the property, industry and intelligence of\r\n     the country from all representation in the legislature is\r\n     injurious to those excluded, and to the community at large.\r\n\r\n     Several bills having special reference to the interests and\r\n     _status_ of women have been introduced in parliament during the\r\n     present session. This affords a powerful reason for the immediate\r\n     enfranchisement of women, in order that members of parliament may\r\n     have the same sense of responsibility towards the class affected\r\n     by them whether dealing with questions relating to women or to\r\n     men.\r\n\r\n     For these and other reasons we earnestly beg that you will give\r\n     your support to the amendment to be introduced by Mr. Woodall in\r\n     committee on the Representation of the People bill for including\r\n     women householders in its operation. We are, sir, yours\r\n     faithfully,[561]\r\n\r\nIn this circular women of all opinions were represented, but a\r\nspecial circular, signed only by ladies of Conservative views, was\r\nsent to the conservative associations. These ladies pointed out\r\nthat justice to women themselves, and the welfare of the whole\r\ncommunity are involved in the admission of the women householders\r\nwho at this moment are possessed of the existing statutory\r\nqualifications:\r\n\r\n     To bring in a new class, under new conditions, whilst continuing\r\n     to exclude those who fulfill the present conditions, would be\r\n     very injurious to those excluded and set a wrong example before\r\n     the community. Every enlargement of the electoral franchise for\r\n     men which can now take place necessarily includes many whose\r\n     interests in the country cannot equal those of the women who now\r\n     claim it. Their position is already recognized by their\r\n     possession of every local franchise whatsoever. Justice requires\r\n     that the principle should be fully carried out by extending to\r\n     women the right to vote for members of parliament, whose\r\n     legislation so strongly affects their welfare. Prudence also\r\n     requires that an important class of educated and philanthropic\r\n     persons should not be left out, or their claims postponed, when a\r\n     large addition is likely to be made to the less educated portion\r\n     of the electorate. We most seriously believe that few things\r\n     could happen more dangerous for the real happiness of the nation\r\n     than to permit the opportunity to pass without the admission of\r\n     legally qualified women within the circle of the constitution.\r\n\r\nA correspondence also was conducted with Mr. Gladstone by the\r\nBristol Ladies' Liberal Association and others whom they invited to\r\njoin them, of known Liberal views, urging him to receive a\r\ndelegation and praying that\r\n\r\n     It may not in the future be said that women alone were unworthy\r\n     of any measure of confidence which you so rightly extended even\r\n     to the humblest and most ignorant men.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone declined to receive the deputation, partly on the\r\nground of illness, partly lest the admission of their views might\r\ninterfere with his plans for the bill. So the day of battle drew\r\non, when a rumor began to be circulated that the government\r\nintended to oppose Mr. Woodall's clause, on the ground that its\r\nadmission might endanger the bill. Strenuous efforts were at the\r\nsame time made to induce him to withdraw the amendment, and the\r\ngovernment whips plainly intimated that the question would not be\r\nconsidered an open one, on which members were to be free to vote\r\naccording to their convictions, but as one which the government had\r\nmade up their minds to oppose. With the hope of changing this\r\ndetermination a memorial was signed by seventy-seven members of\r\nparliament, and presented to Mr. Gladstone, asking him to leave the\r\nintroduction of the clause an open question. It represented--\r\n\r\n     That the Franchise bill being now in committee a favorable\r\n     opportunity is afforded for the discussion of the amendment for\r\n     extending its provisions to women, of which notice has been given\r\n     by Mr. Woodall.\r\n\r\n     That your memorialists have heard a rumor that her majesty's\r\n     government have declared against allowing the question to be\r\n     discussed and decided on its merits, on the ground that the\r\n     adoption of the proposal might endanger the bill.\r\n\r\n     That your memorialists are of the opinion that the claim of women\r\n     who are householders and ratepayers is just and reasonable, and\r\n     that the time when the House is engaged in amending the law\r\n     relating to the representation of the people is the proper time\r\n     for the consideration of this claim.\r\n\r\n     That during the discussion in committee on the Reform bill of\r\n     1867, an amendment for extending its provisions to women was\r\n     introduced by Mr. John Stuart Mill, and that on that occasion the\r\n     government of the day offered no opposition to the full and free\r\n     discussion of the question, and placed no restriction on the free\r\n     exercise of the judgment of members of their party as to the\r\n     manner in which they should vote. The tellers appointed against\r\n     Mr. Mill's motion were not even the government tellers.\r\n\r\n     That your memorialists earnestly pray that the precedent so\r\n     instituted may be followed on the present occasion, and that the\r\n     clause proposed by Mr. Woodall may be submitted to the free and\r\n     unbiased decision of the House on its own merits.\r\n\r\n     They desire earnestly to express their conviction that the course\r\n     of allowing the question to be an open one, on which the\r\n     government is prepared to accept the decision of the House,\r\n     cannot possibly endanger or prejudice the Franchise bill. In\r\n     connection with this your memorialists would press on your\r\n     attention the fact that Mr. Woodall's amendment is in the form of\r\n     a new clause, and would not therefore come under discussion until\r\n     the bill as it stands has passed through committee.\r\n\r\nThis request was refused. On June 9, such unexpected progress was\r\nmade by the committee of the House of Commons with the Franchise\r\nbill that all the government clauses were carried. There were many\r\namendments on the paper which took precedence of Mr. Woodall's, but\r\nthese were hastily gone through or withdrawn, and in the middle of\r\nthe morning sitting of June 9, he rose and moved the introduction\r\nof his clause. Mr. Woodall's speech was a masterpiece of earnest\r\nbut temperate reasoning. He was fortunate enough to present an old\r\nand well-worn subject in new lights. He said that Mr. Gladstone had\r\naffirmed the principle of the measure to be to give every\r\nhouseholder a vote, and it would now be his endeavor to pursuade\r\nparliament that women were capable citizens, who would meet all the\r\nconditions so clearly laid down by the prime minister. Against the\r\ncharge of inopportunity in bringing the subject forward at this\r\ncrisis, he reminded the House of Mr. Chamberlain's words on a\r\nrecent occasion, that it was always opportune to do right.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Gladstone said there were two questions to be considered. One\r\n     of these was the question whether women were to be enfranchised,\r\n     the other whether the enfranchisement should be effected by a\r\n     clause introduced in committee on the present bill. The second\r\n     question was that on which he was about to dwell. He deprecated\r\n     the introduction of new matter into the bill. The cargo which the\r\n     vessel carried was, in the opinion of the government, as large as\r\n     she could carry safely. The proposal was a very large one. It did\r\n     not seem unreasonable to believe that the number of persons in\r\n     the three kingdoms to be enfranchised by the amendment would be\r\n     little short of half a million. What was the position in which\r\n     Mr. Woodall placed the government when he requested them to\r\n     introduce a completely new subject on which men profoundly\r\n     differed, and which, it was clear, should receive a full and\r\n     dispassioned investigation? It was not now practicable to give\r\n     that investigation. This was one of those questions which it\r\n     would be intolerable to mix up with purely political and party\r\n     debates. If there was a subject in the whole compass of human\r\n     life and experience that was sacred beyond all other subjects it\r\n     was the character and position of woman. Did his honorable friend\r\n     ask him to admit that the question deserved the fullest\r\n     consideration? He gave him that admission freely. Did he ask\r\n     whether he (Mr. Gladstone) wished to bind the members of the\r\n     Government or his colleagues in the cabinet with respect to the\r\n     votes they would give on this question? Certainly not, provided\r\n     only that they took the subject from the vortex of political\r\n     contention. He was bound to say, whilst thus free and open on the\r\n     subject itself, that with regard to the proposal to introduce it\r\n     into this bill he offered it the strongest opposition in his\r\n     power, and must disclaim and renounce all responsibility for the\r\n     measure should Mr. Woodall succeed in inducing the committee to\r\n     adopt his amendment.\r\n\r\nOn motion of Lord John Manners the debate was adjourned till June\r\n12.\r\n\r\nOn the intervening day a meeting was summoned of the general\r\ncommittee of the society. Miss Cobbe first, and Mr. Woodall\r\nsubsequently, presided, and the following resolutions were passed:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the claim of duly qualified women to the\r\n     exercise of the suffrage having been continuously presented\r\n     before parliament and the country since the Reform bill of 1867,\r\n     this meeting is of opinion that the time when the legislature is\r\n     again engaged in amending the law relating to the representation\r\n     of the people is the proper time for the consideration of this\r\n     claim.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That this meeting heartily approves of the amendment\r\n     which Mr. Woodall has moved in committee on the Franchise bill\r\n     for extending its provisions to duly qualified women, and pledge\r\n     themselves to support his action by every means in their power.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That they have heard with astonishment that her\r\n     majesty's government refuse to allow this amendment to be\r\n     discussed on its merits and to be decided by the free exercise of\r\n     the judgment of members of the House of Commons, but that the\r\n     government require their supporters to refrain from such free\r\n     exercise of their judgment on the alleged ground that the\r\n     adoption of the proposal would endanger the Franchise bill.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That in the opinion of this meeting the exercise of\r\n     such pressure appears to be an infringement of the privileges of\r\n     a free parliament and an aggression on the rights of the people.\r\n     They hold that all sections of the community, whether electors or\r\n     non-electors, have an indefeasible right to have matters\r\n     affecting their interests submitted to the unbiased judgment, and\r\n     decided by the unfettered discretion of the members sent to\r\n     represent them in parliament.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That a declaration signed by 110 Liberal members of\r\n     the House of Commons was presented last session to Mr. Gladstone\r\n     which set forth that, in the opinion of the memorialists, no\r\n     measure for the assimilation of the borough and county franchise\r\n     could be satisfactory unless it contained provisions for\r\n     extending the suffrage, without distinction of sex, to all\r\n     persons who possess the statutory qualifications for the\r\n     parliamentary franchise.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That this meeting calls upon those who signed this\r\n     declaration, and all other members who believe that the claim of\r\n     duly qualified women to the parliamentary franchise is reasonable\r\n     and just, to support the clause moved by Mr. Woodall, in\r\n     committee on the Franchise bill, for extending its provisions to\r\n     such women.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That a copy of these resolutions be forwarded to Mr.\r\n     Gladstone and to every member of parliament.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That petitions to both houses of parliament in\r\n     support of Mr. Woodall's clause be adopted and signed by the\r\n     chairman on behalf of this meeting.\r\n\r\nSome members of parliament who attended this meeting explained that\r\nthough they were as firmly convinced as ever of the justice of the\r\nclaim, they could not vote for it after Mr. Gladstone's distinct\r\ndeclaration that he would abandon the bill if the amendment were\r\npassed. On June 12 Lord John Manners resumed the debate. He said:\r\n\r\n     That although this proposal had never been of a party character,\r\n     it had always been a political question. There was no question\r\n     connected with the franchise which had been more thoroughly\r\n     discussed, threshed and sifted. Guided by every consideration of\r\n     justice and fairness, of equity, of analogy and experience, he\r\n     should give it his cordial and unhesitating support.\r\n\r\nThe next speech of importance was Mr. Stansfeld's. He maintained\r\nthat the acceptance of the clause by the government would have\r\nstrengthened rather than weakened the bill, and that its insertion\r\ncertainly would not have rendered the bill less palatable to the\r\nHouse of Lords:\r\n\r\n     The principle of this bill is household suffrage. Household\r\n     suffrage is one of two things--it is either put as a rough test\r\n     of capable citizenship, or else it means what I will call the\r\n     family vote. The women to be enfranchised under this clause would\r\n     be first of all women of property, intelligence and education,\r\n     having a status in the country; secondly a large class of women\r\n     of exceptional competency, because having lost the services and\r\n     support of men who should be the bread-winners and the heads of\r\n     families, they are obliged to step into their shoes and to take\r\n     upon themselves the burdens and responsibilities which had\r\n     previously devolved upon men, and because they have done this\r\n     with success. I decline either by word or deed to make the\r\n     admission that these women are less capable citizens than the\r\n     2,000,000 whom the right honorable gentleman proposes to\r\n     enfranchise by this bill. Well, then, let it be the family\r\n     vote--that is to say, exceptions apart, let the basis of our\r\n     constitution be that the family, represented by its head, should\r\n     be the unit of the State. Now that is the idea which recommends\r\n     and has always recommended itself to my mind. But on what\r\n     principle, or with what regard to the permanence and stability of\r\n     that principle, can you exclude the head of the family and give\r\n     that family no voice, because the head happens to be a woman? If\r\n     this clause be excluded from the measure, as it will be, this\r\n     will not be a bill of one principle, but of two principles. It\r\n     will not be a bill containing only the principle of household\r\n     suffrage interpreted as the family vote, but one founded on these\r\n     two principles--first, a male householding vote; and, secondly,\r\n     the exclusion of the head of the household when the head is a\r\n     woman. That is a permanent principle of exclusion, and therefore\r\n     the bill with this clause left out is a declaration for ever\r\n     against the political emancipation of women.\r\n\r\nAfter some speeches against the motion Colonel King-Harman said:\r\n\r\n     In the old state of the franchise it was not so much a matter of\r\n     importance to women whether they possessed votes or not, but now\r\n     that this bill proposed to create two million new voters of a\r\n     much lower order than those now exercising the franchise, it\r\n     became of importance to secure some countervailing advantage.\r\n     They were told this was a matter which could wait. What were the\r\n     women to gain by waiting? They had waited for seventeen years\r\n     during which the subject had been discussed, and now they were\r\n     told to wait till two million of the common orders had been\r\n     admitted to a share in the parliamentary management of the\r\n     country. The honorable member for Huddersfield (Mr. Leatham) had\r\n     used an argument which he (Colonel King-Harman) thought a most\r\n     unworthy one, namely, that the franchise was not to be extended\r\n     to women, because, unhappily, there are women of a degraded and\r\n     debased class. Because there were 40,000 of them in this\r\n     metropolis alone, the remaining women who were pure and virtuous\r\n     were to be deprived of the power of voting. But would Mr. Leatham\r\n     guarantee that the 2,000,000 men he proposes to enfranchise shall\r\n     be perfectly pure and moral men? Would he propose a clause to\r\n     exclude from the franchise those men who lead and retain in vice\r\n     and degradation these unfortunate women? No--men may sin and be a\r\n     power in the State, but when a woman sins not only is she to have\r\n     no power, but her whole sisterhood are to be excluded from it. He\r\n     believed that every idea of common sense pointed to the\r\n     desirability of supporting the amendment, and he therefore had\r\n     great pleasure in doing so.\r\n\r\nThere were also excellent speeches from Mr. Cowen (Newcastle),\r\nGeneral Alexander, Sir Wilfred Lawson and Mr. Story, and finally\r\nfrom Sir Stafford Northcote the leader of the Conservative\r\nopposition. He observed:\r\n\r\n     That the prime minister had told them that they did not consider\r\n     this clause to be properly introduced now, because this was not\r\n     the time for the question. It seemed to him, on the contrary,\r\n     that it was the very best opportunity for dealing with it,\r\n     because they were going enormously to increase the electorate,\r\n     and would, therefore, make the inequality between men and women\r\n     much greater than it was before. It would be said they were going\r\n     to extend the property franchise if this amendment were carried.\r\n     On that issue they were prepared to join and to maintain that it\r\n     was a right thing, and it was the duty of that House to make\r\n     proper provision for those classes of property holders now\r\n     without a vote. Members who had canvassed boroughs would remember\r\n     that after going into two or three shops and asking for the votes\r\n     of those who were owners, they have come to one perhaps of the\r\n     most important shops and have been told, \"Oh, it is of no use\r\n     going in, there is no vote there.\" Such women are probably of\r\n     education and gentle character, and perhaps live as widows and\r\n     take care of their families; they have every right to be\r\n     consulted as to who should be the man to represent the\r\n     constituency in which they lived and to take care of their\r\n     interests and the interests of those dependent on them. That was\r\n     the ground on which Lord Beaconsfield stood. They had adhered to\r\n     that ground for several years, and there they stood now.\r\n\r\nThe division took place at a late hour with the result that the\r\nclause was defeated by 271 votes to 135, being a majority against\r\nit of 136, or two to one. But though such a vote would have been a\r\nsore discouragement if it had represented the real opinion of the\r\nHouse, on the present occasion it meant little if anything. The\r\ngovernment had sent out a \"five-line\" whip for its supporters, and\r\nso effective had this whip been, combined with Mr. Gladstone's\r\nassertion that he would give up the responsibility of the bill if\r\nthe clause were carried, that 98 Liberals and 6 Home Rulers, known\r\nto be supporters of our cause, voted with the government, even Mr.\r\nHugh Mason being among this number, while 34 Liberals and 7 Home\r\nRulers, also friends of ours, were absent from the division. We may\r\nsafely assume that had the government more wisely left it an open\r\nquestion, upon which members were free to vote according to their\r\nconsciences, our defeat would have been turned into a victory. On\r\nthe other hand while our Liberal friends thus voted against the\r\namendment or abstained from voting, the bulk of our supporters in\r\nthis division were Conservatives, a circumstance unknown in the\r\nprevious history of the movement.\r\n\r\nAn important conference of friends and supporters was held the next\r\nmorning in the Westminster Palace Hotel at which Mr. Stansfeld\r\npresided. To use Miss Tod's words:\r\n\r\n     Never had a defeated army met in a more victorious mood. There\r\n     was much indeed to encourage in the degree of importance to which\r\n     the question had attained. It had risen from a purely speculative\r\n     into a pressing political question; it had been debated during\r\n     two days, and it was heartily supported by the Conservative\r\n     leader.\r\n\r\nThe speeches at the conference were animated and full of hope for\r\nthe future. Mr. Stansfeld congratulated the meeting on having made\r\na new departure; their question had become one of practical\r\npolitics, and they had now to address themselves in all the\r\nconstituencies to the political organizations.\r\n\r\nA magnificent meeting was held in St. James Hall the following\r\nweek. The hall was densely crowded in every part, and an overflow\r\nmeeting was arranged for those unable to gain admission. Some of\r\nthe speakers[562] proposed as the best measure for agitation, a\r\ndetermined resistance against taxation.[563]\r\n\r\nRepeated attempts to obtain a day for the debate and division were\r\nfollowed by repeated disappointments. The session commenced in\r\nNovember, 1884. Mr. Woodall at once gave notice of a bill. In\r\npresenting it to the House, he concluded after consultation with\r\nparliamentary friends, to add a clause defining the action of his\r\nbill to be limited to unmarried women and widows.[564] The enacting\r\nclause of the bill was as follows:\r\n\r\n     For all purposes of and incidental to the voting for members to\r\n     serve in parliament, women shall have the same rights as men, and\r\n     all enactments relating to or concerned in such elections shall\r\n     be construed accordingly, provided that nothing in this act shall\r\n     enable women under coverture to be registered or to vote at such\r\n     elections.\r\n\r\nThe addition of this clause excited much discussion. Those in favor\r\nof it argued that this limitation would certainly be imposed in\r\ncommittee of the House, which though it was in all probability\r\nprepared to give the vote to women possessed of independence,\r\ndreaded the extension of faggot votes which would have been the\r\nalmost inevitable consequence of admitting married women; while the\r\nresult would be the same whether the limitation clause was\r\nintroduced by the promoters of the bill or by a parliamentary\r\ncommittee, and it would be more likely to obtain support at the\r\nsecond reading if its intentions were made clear in the beginning.\r\nOn the other hand it was argued that the principle of giving the\r\nvote to women in the same degree that it was given to men, was the\r\nbasis upon which the whole agitation rested; that marriage was no\r\ndisqualification to men, and therefore should not prove so to\r\nwomen; and that, though it might be necessary to accept a\r\nlimitation by parliament, it was not right for the society to lower\r\nits standard by proposing a compromise. This divergence in the\r\nviews of the supporters of the movement was the cause of much\r\ndiscussion in the public press and elsewhere, and unfortunately\r\nresulted in the abstention of some of the oldest friends of the\r\ncause from working in support of this particular bill, although it\r\nwas admitted on all sides that if a day could be obtained its\r\nchances in a division were very good.\r\n\r\nThe bill was introduced on November 19, 1884, and its opponents\r\ntook the unprecedented course of challenging a division at this\r\nstage. Leave was however given to bring it in, and the second\r\nreading was set down for November 25, and then for December 9; on\r\neach occasion it was postponed owing to the adjournment of the\r\nHouse. It was next set down for Wednesday, March 4, but its chance\r\nwas again destroyed by the appropriation by the government of all\r\nWednesdays for the Seats bill. Mr. Woodall then fixed on June 24,\r\nbut before that time the ministerial crisis occurred, and when that\r\nday arrived the House had been adjourned for the reelections\r\nconsequent upon a change of government. He then obtained the first\r\nplace on Wednesday, July 22, but again ministers appropriated\r\nWednesdays, and all chances for the session being over, Mr. Woodall\r\ngave order to discharge the bill.\r\n\r\nThis delay stands in sharp and painful contrast with the promptness\r\nwith which parliament passed the Medical Relief bill. A clause had\r\nbeen inserted in the Franchise bill disfranchising any man who had\r\nbeen in receipt of parish medical aid for himself or family. This\r\nclause caused great dissatisfaction as it was stated it would\r\ndisqualify from voting a large number of laborers in the\r\nagricultural counties; parliament therefore found time amidst all\r\nthe press of business and party divisions to pass the Medical\r\nRelief bill removing this disfranchisement from _men_, though we\r\nare repeatedly assured that nothing but the want of time prevents\r\ntheir fair consideration of the enfranchisement of _women_. It is\r\nanother proof that there is always time for a representative\r\ngovernment to attend to the wants of its constituents.\r\n\r\nAnother effort was made in the House of Lords by Lord Denman who\r\nintroduced a bill for extending the parliamentary vote to women.\r\nThe committees[565] were unaware of his intention until they read\r\na notice of the bill in the newspapers. The enacting clause was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     All women, not legally disqualified, who have the same\r\n     qualifications as the present and future electors for counties\r\n     and divisions of counties and boroughs, shall be entitled to vote\r\n     for knights of the shire for counties and divisions of counties\r\n     and for boroughs, at every election.\r\n\r\nA division was taken upon it on June 23, just after the Seats bill\r\nhad been passed and the peers were about to adjourn in consequence\r\nof the change of government. Many protests were made that the time\r\nwas ill chosen, and some peers left the House to avoid recording\r\ntheir votes while others voted against it without reference to its\r\nmerits as a question. The division showed 8 in favor and 36\r\nagainst. There appears to be a strong impression that if a bill to\r\nenfranchise women were passed by the Commons it would be accepted\r\nby the Lords, while there is at the same time a feeling that any\r\nmeasure dealing with the representation of the people should\r\noriginate with the Commons, and not in the upper House.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1885 we sustained the loss of many of the earliest\r\nfriends of the movement; chief among these Professor Fawcett, who\r\nfrom the commencement of its history had given it his firm and\r\nunflinching support. His conviction that justice and freedom must\r\ngain the upper hand often caused him to take a more sanguine view\r\nof the prospect than the event has justified. He was the firm\r\nfriend of women in all their recent efforts, and helped them to\r\nobtain employment in the civil service, to enter the medical\r\nprofession, to open the universities, and in many other ways. Next\r\nto be mentioned is the death of Mrs. Stansfeld. She was the\r\ndaughter of Mr. William H. Ashurst, who was a staunch advocate of\r\nfreedom and may be remembered as the first English friend of\r\nWilliam L. Garrison. She had been a member of the suffrage\r\ncommittee in London for more than sixteen years, and gave unfailing\r\nsympathy to all the efforts made by her noble husband, James\r\nStansfeld, in behalf of the rights of humanity. This year has also\r\nbeen saddened by the death of Mrs. Ronald Shearer, formerly Helena\r\nDowning, an able and true-hearted woman, who had devoted her\r\nstrength and talents to the furtherance of our cause at a time when\r\nits advocates were still the objects of ridicule and attack.\r\n\r\nThe electorate of three millions of men is now increased to five\r\nmillions, and by this extension of the suffrage the difficulty of\r\nwaging an up-hill fight in the interests of the still excluded\r\nclass has also been increased. The interests of the newly\r\nrepresented classes will imperatively claim precedence in the new\r\nparliament. Like the emancipated blacks who received the vote after\r\nthe American civil war, while the women who had supported the cause\r\nof the Union by their enthusiasm and their sacrifices were passed\r\nover, the miners and laborers of English counties have received the\r\nfranchise for which they have never asked, in preference to the\r\nwomen who have worked, petitioned and organized themselves for\r\nyears to secure it. Women have now to appeal to this new electorate\r\nto grant that justice which the old electorate has denied them;\r\nthey have to begin again the weary round of educating their new\r\nmasters by appeals and arguments; they will once more see their\r\ninterests \"unavoidably\" deferred to the interests of the\r\nrepresented classes; they will once again be bidden to stand aside\r\ntill it is time for another Reform bill to be considered!\r\n\r\nIn recounting the history of woman suffrage frequent allusion has\r\nbeen made to the parallel movements which have been carried on\r\nthrough the same course of years; the most important of these have\r\nbeen: (1) The admission of women to fields of public usefulness;\r\n(2) removal of legal disabilities and hardships; (3) admission to a\r\nbetter education and greater freedom of employment. Much of the\r\nprogress that has been made has been the work of the active friends\r\nof woman suffrage, and under the fostering care of the suffrage\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\nUnder the first division comes the work of women on the\r\nschool-boards. The education act of 1870 expressly guaranteed their\r\nright of being elected, and even in the first year several were\r\nelected. One, Miss Becker, in Manchester, has retained her seat\r\never since. In London the number of lady members has greatly\r\nvaried. Beginning with two, Miss Jarrett and Miss Davis, in 1879 it\r\nrose to nine, but now, 1885, has sunk again to three, Miss\r\nDavenport Hill, Mrs. Westlake, and Mrs. Webster. Taken as a whole,\r\ntheir influence has been very usefully exerted for the benefit of\r\nthe children and the young teachers. Under this head also comes\r\nwomen's work as poor-law guardians. The first was elected in\r\nKensington in 1875. Six years afterwards a small society to promote\r\nthe election of women was founded by Miss Mueller, and the number\r\nelected is steadily increasing. There are now in England and\r\nScotland in all forty-six. In Ireland women are still debarred from\r\nthis useful work. The election occurs every year, and it is one of\r\nthe local franchises that women as well as men exercise. Last year\r\nthree ladies were appointed members of the Metropolitan Board which\r\nlooks after London hospitals and asylums. In 1873 Mr. Stansford,\r\nthen president of the local government board, appointed Mrs. Hassan\r\nSession assistant inspector of work-houses, and after an interval\r\nof twelve years Miss Mason was appointed to the same position.\r\nWomen are also sometimes appointed as church wardens, overseers of\r\nthe roads, and registrars of births and deaths. These are the only\r\npublic offices they fill.\r\n\r\nUnder the second heading, the removal of legal disabilities, is\r\nincluded the Married Woman's Property act, which was finally passed\r\nin 1882, twenty-five years after it had been first brought forward\r\nin parliament by Sir Erskine Perry. The ancient law of England\r\ntransferred all property held by a woman, except land, absolutely\r\nto her husband. A step was gained in 1870 by which the money she\r\nhad actually earned became her own. This was followed by frequent\r\namendments, sometimes in Scotland, sometimes in England, and a\r\ncomprehensive bill met with frequent vicissitudes, now in the House\r\nof Lords, now in the Commons. The honor of this long contest is\r\nchiefly due to Mrs. Jacob Bright and Mrs. Wolstenholme Elmy, whose\r\nunwearied efforts were finally crowned with success by the act of\r\n1882, under which the property of a married woman is absolutely\r\nsecured to her as if she were single, and the power to contract and\r\nof sueing and being sued, also secured to her. The right to the\r\ncustody of their own children is another point for which women are\r\nstruggling. In 1884, Mr. Bryce, M. P., brought in a bill to render\r\na mother the legal guardian of her children after the father's\r\ndeath. This was read a second time by a vote of 207 for, and only\r\n73 against. In 1885, however, though passing the House of Lords, it\r\nwas postponed till too late in the Commons. Another important\r\nalteration in the legal condition of married women was made in\r\n1878. In that year Mr. Herschell introduced the Matrimonial Causes\r\nact to remedy a gross injustice in the divorce law, and Lord\r\nPensance inserted a clause which provided that if a woman were\r\nbrutally ill-treated by her husband, a magistrate might order a\r\nseparate maintenance for her and assign her the care of her\r\nchildren. It is no secret that the original drafting of this clause\r\nwas due to Miss Frances Power Cobbe. The long struggle which is not\r\nyet terminated against the infamous Contagious Diseases acts\r\nbelongs to this division of work. The acts were passed in 1866,\r\n'69, and for many years were supported by an overpowering majority\r\nof the House of Commons. Mr. Stansfeld, who has always been the\r\nsupporter of every movement advancing the influence of women, has\r\nbeen the leader of this agitation. Mrs. Josephine Butler, Mrs.\r\nStewart of Ougar, and latterly Mrs. Ormiston Chant, have been the\r\nmost untiring speakers on this question. On April 26, 1883, Mr.\r\nStansfeld carried a resolution by a vote of 184 against 112 for the\r\nabolition of the acts, since which time the acts have been\r\nsuspended, but we must look to the new parliament for their total\r\nrepeal. The Criminal-law Amendment act was the great triumph of\r\n1885. It had been postponed session after session, but the bold\r\ndenunciation of Mr. Stead, editor of the _Pall Mall Gazette_,\r\nfinally roused the national conscience, and now a larger measure of\r\nprotection is afforded to young girls than has ever been known\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nOf the successive steps by which colleges have been founded for\r\nwomen, and the universities opened to them, it is impossible to\r\ngive any record. The London University and the Royal University of\r\nIreland, recognize fully the equality of women; nine ladies secured\r\nthe B. A. diploma from the latter university in 1884, and nine more\r\nin 1885. Oxford and Cambridge extend their examinations to women.\r\nThe Victoria University acknowledges their claim to examination.\r\nThe London school of medicine gives a first rate education to women\r\n(there are 48 this session), and the Royal College of Surgeons,\r\nDublin, admits them to its classes. There are now about 45 ladies\r\nwho are registered as medical practitioners. One of them, Miss\r\nEdith Stone, was appointed by Mr. Fawcett medical superintendent of\r\nthe female staff at the general post-office, London. The success of\r\nthe movement for supplying women as physicians for the vast Indian\r\nempire has attained remarkable success during the last two years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[536] This was called out by the movement in America. A report of a\r\nconvention held in Worcester, Mass., published in the New York\r\n_Tribune_, fell into the hands of Mrs. Taylor and aroused her to\r\nactive thought on the question. She comments on a very able series\r\nof resolutions passed at this convention, in which such men\r\nas Emerson, Parker, Channing, Garrison and Phillips took\r\npart.--[EDITORS.\r\n\r\n[537] _Council of the Association_--Mrs. S. Turner, Mrs. S.\r\nBartholomew, Mrs. E. Stephenson, Mrs. M. Whalley, Mrs. E. Rooke,\r\nMrs. E. Wade, Mrs. C. Ash, president _pro tem._, Mrs. E.\r\nCavill, treasurer, Mrs. M. Brook, financial-secretary, Mrs. A.\r\nHigginbottom, corresponding secretary.\r\n\r\n[538] Mrs. Biggs, Anna Knight, Mrs. Hugo Reid and many other\r\nEnglish women were roused to white heat on this question, by the\r\nexclusion of women as delegates from the World's Anti-slavery\r\nConvention held in London in 1840. That was the first pronounced\r\npublic discussion, lasting one entire day, on the whole question of\r\nwoman's rights that ever took place in England, and as the\r\narguments were reproduced in the leading journals and discussed at\r\nevery fireside, a grand educational work was inaugurated at\r\nthat time. The American delegates spent several months in\r\nEngland--Lucretia Mott speaking at many points. She occupied the\r\nUnitarian pulpit in London and elsewhere. As Mrs. Hugo Reid sat in\r\nthis convention throughout the proceedings and met Lucretia Mott\r\nsocially on several occasions, we may credit her outspoken\r\nopinions, in 1843, in a measure to these influences.--[EDITORS.\r\n\r\n[539] The committee as at first formed, consisted of the following\r\npersons: The very Rev. the Dean of Canterbury, Dr. Alford, Miss\r\nJessie Boucherett, Professor Cairnes, Rev. W. L. Clay, Miss Davies,\r\nthe originator of Girton College, Lady Goldsmid, Mr. G. W.\r\nHastings, Mr. James Heywood, Mrs. Knox, Miss Manning, and Mrs.\r\nHensleigh Wedgwood. Mrs. Peter A. Taylor was treasurer, and Mrs. J.\r\nW. Smith, _nee_ Miss Garrett, honorary secretary. A few months\r\nlater Mrs. Smith's death left this post vacant, and Mrs. P. A.\r\nTaylor then assumed the office of secretary which she retained with\r\nthe aid of Miss Caroline Ashurst Biggs till 1871. No one else could\r\nhave rendered such services to our movement while it was in its\r\ninfancy as Mrs. Taylor gave. Her gentle and dignified presence, her\r\nuntiring energy, the experience of organization and public life\r\nwhich she already possessed, her influence with an extended circle\r\nof friends chosen from among the most liberal thinkers of the\r\nnation, secured at once attention and respect for any cause she\r\ntook up. Many years before she had worked hard for the association\r\nof the Friends of Italy, and on the breaking out of the American\r\ncivil war her sympathies and practical knowledge led her to found a\r\nsociety for assisting the freedmen. In acknowledgment of the\r\ninvaluable assistance she rendered, her friends in America sent a\r\nbook containing a complete set of photographs of all the chief\r\nanti-slavery workers. When she began her efforts for women's\r\nsuffrage, the English Abolitionists were among the first\r\ncorrespondents to whom she applied, and they nearly all responded\r\ncordially. For years her house, Aubrey House, Kensington, was the\r\ncentre of the London organization to which she gave her time,\r\nstrength, and money, well earning the title of \"Mother of the\r\nMovement,\" which loving friends have since bestowed.\r\n\r\n[540] In 1869, 255 petitions, signed by 61,475 persons; in 1870,\r\n663 petitions, signed by 134,561 persons; in 1871, 622 petitions,\r\nsigned by 186,976 persons (75 of these petitions were from public\r\nmeetings and signed only by the chairman, or from town councils and\r\nsealed with the official seal); in 1872, 829 petitions with 350,093\r\nsignatures; in 1873, 919 petitions, with 329,206 signatures; in\r\n1874, 1,494 petitions with 430,343 signatures; and in 1875, 1,273\r\npetitions were sent in containing 415,622 signatures.\r\n\r\n[541] This lady, sister of John and Jacob Bright, and wife of the\r\nsenior member for Edinburgh, Mr. Duncan McLaren, so much esteemed\r\nthat he was sometimes spoken of as the \"Member for Scotland,\"\r\nunites in her own person all the requisites for a leader of the\r\nmovement. She has the charm and dignified grace so generally found\r\namong Quaker ladies, and the pathetic eloquence which belong to her\r\nfamily. She is clear-sighted in planning action, and enthusiastic\r\nand warm-hearted in carrying it out, and for the past sixteen years\r\nthe movement in Scotland has centered around her.\r\n\r\n[542] Mr. Thomas Hare, Mr. Boyd Kinnear, Mr. Mill, who was no\r\nlonger in parliament, the Rev. Charles Kingsley (this was the first\r\nand only meeting at which he was present), Prof. Fawcett, M. P. and\r\nMrs. Fawcett, Lord Houghton, Mr. John Morley, Sir Charles W. Dilke,\r\nBt. M. P., Mr. P. A. Taylor, M. P., Professor Masson of Edinburgh,\r\nand Mr. Stamfeld, M. P.\r\n\r\n[543] Mrs. Penington, Mr. Hopwood, Q.

The principal committees united with\r\nthe central, including Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, Edinburgh,\r\nDublin and the North of Ireland.\r\n\r\n[544] Minutes of a meeting at the House of Commons, June 23, 1875.\r\nPresent: The Right Honorable E. P. Bouverie, in the chair; and the\r\nfollowing members of parliament: Right Hon. H. C. Childers, Marquis\r\nof Hamilton, Lord Randolph Churchill, Hon. E. Stanhope, Mr.\r\nBentinck, Mr. Beresford Hope, Mr. Chaplin, Mr. Hayter, Sir Henry\r\nHolland, Sir Henry James, Mr. Kay Shuttleworth, Mr. Edward Leatham,\r\nMr. Merewether, Mr. Newdegate, Mr. Raikes, Mr. de Rothschild, Mr.\r\nScousfield, Mr. Whitbread.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That a committee of peers, members of parliament and\r\nother influential men be organized for the purpose of maintaining\r\nthe integrity of the franchise, in opposition to the claims for the\r\nextension of the parliamentary suffrage to women.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That Mr. E. P. Bouverie be requested to act as\r\nchairman, and Lord Claud John Hamilton and Mr. Kay Shuttleworth as\r\nhonorary secretaries.\r\n\r\nThe following members have since joined those named above: Lord\r\nElcho, Right Hon. E. Knatchbull-Hugessen, Right Hon. J. R. Mowbray,\r\nSir Thomas Bazley, Mr. Butt, Mr. Gibson and Colonel Kingscote.\r\n\r\n[545] We must mention the names of the ladies who during the\r\nprevious two or three years had been most active in speaking and\r\norganizing societies. So many meetings had been held that there was\r\nhardly a town of any importance in England, Ireland or Scotland\r\nwhere the principles of woman suffrage had not been explained and\r\ncanvassed. One of the foremost for her activity in this department\r\nof work was Miss Mary Beedy, an American lady, resident for some\r\nyears in England. She had thoroughly mastered the legal and\r\npolitical condition of the question in this country, and her\r\nuntiring energy, her clear common sense, and her ready logic made\r\nher advocacy invaluable. The regret was general when she was\r\ncompelled to return to America. Miss Helena Downing, niece of Mr.\r\nMcCarthy Downing, member of parliament for Cork, arranged and gave\r\nmany lectures during 1873 and 1874. Miss. Lillias Ashworth,\r\nhonorary secretary of the Bristol committee, frequently spoke at\r\nmeetings about this time. In Scotland Miss Jane Taylour and others\r\nstill continued their indefatigable labors, in which they were\r\nfrequently assisted by Miss Isabella Stuart of Balgonie in\r\nFifeshire. In Ireland, in addition to the usual meetings in the\r\nnorth, a series of meetings in the south was undertaken by Miss\r\nTod, Miss Beedy and Miss Downing. Other meetings were addressed by\r\nMiss Fawcett, Miss Becker, Miss Caroline Biggs, Miss Eliza Sturge,\r\nMiss Rhoda Garrett, Mrs. Fenwick-Miller and many others. During\r\n1873 Mrs. Henry Kingsley, sister-in-law of one novelist and wife of\r\nanother, also spoke frequently. Space fails me to do justice to the\r\nvaried powers of the speakers who have carried our movement on\r\nduring these years of patient perseverance; to the clear logic and\r\nconvincing power of Mrs. Fawcett's speeches; to the thrilling\r\neloquence of her cousin, Rhoda Garrett, now, alas! no longer with\r\nus; to Miss Becker's accurate legal knowledge and masterly\r\npresentation of facts and arguments; to Miss Helena Downing's\r\neloquence marked by the humor, pathos and power which were hers by\r\nnational inheritance. During these years of trial, too, the cause\r\nowed much to the strenuous advocacy of the Misses Ashworth, Anne\r\nFrances and Lillias Sophia, nieces of Jacob Bright. Miss Ashworth\r\ndid not herself speak at meetings, but she comforted and helped\r\nthose who did, while Lillias possessed the family gift of eloquence\r\nand charmed her audience by her witty, forcible and telling\r\nspeeches. So numerous and so well attended have been these meetings\r\nduring these and subsequent years, that it is impossible to\r\nexonerate men and women from the charge of willful blindness if\r\nthey still misconstrue the plain facts of the question.\r\n\r\n[546] First in the list came six ladies, members of school-boards:\r\nMrs. Buckton of Leeds, Miss Helena Richardson of Bristol, Mrs.\r\nSurr, Mrs. Westlake, Mrs. Fenwick Miller and Miss Helen Taylor,\r\nLondon; then followed the opinions of ladies who were guardians of\r\nthe poor. Forty ladies known as authoresses or painters came next\r\non the list; among these were Mrs. Allingham, Mrs. Cowden Clarke,\r\nMrs. Eiloart, Mary Howitt, Emily Pfeiffer, Augusta Webster. Women\r\ndoctors came next: Dr. Garrett Anderson, Dr. Annie Barker, Dr.\r\nElizabeth Blackwell, Dr. Sophia Jex-Blake, Dr. Eliza Dunbar, Dr.\r\nFrances Hoggan, Dr. Edith Pechey; and next to the doctors came Miss\r\nEliza Orme, the only woman who was successfully practicing law. The\r\nsection of education included the names of Mrs. Wm. Gray, and her\r\nsister. Miss Shirreff, Mrs. Nichol (Edinburgh), Miss Emily Davies,\r\nfounder of Girton College, Miss Byers, founder of the Ladies'\r\nCollegiate School, Belfast, Mrs. Crawshay and Miss Mary Gurney.\r\nNineteen ladies, the heads of women's colleges and high-schools,\r\nnext gave their reasons why they desired the suffrage. After these\r\ncame ladies engaged in philanthropic work, which included the\r\nsisters Rosamund and Florence Davenport Hill, Florence Nightingale,\r\nMiss Ellice Hopkins, eminent for rescue work; Miss Irby, well-known\r\nfor her efforts among the starving Bosnian fugitives; Miss Manning,\r\nsecretary of the National Indian Association; Mrs. Southey,\r\nsecretary of the Women's Peace Association; Mrs. Lucas, and Mrs.\r\nEdward Parker, president and secretary of the British Women's\r\nTemperance Society. The opinions were various, both in kind and in\r\nlength, some being only a confession of faith in a couple of lines,\r\nothers a page of able reasoning.\r\n\r\n[547] Miss Tod gives the spirit to each movement in Ulster, which\r\nis the intellectual headquarters of Ireland. She is the pioneer in\r\nall matters of reform; she is asked to speak in churches; she\r\ninstigated the efforts which led to girls participating in the\r\nbenefits of the Irish Intermediate Education act, which was being\r\nrestricted to boys; she has organized and has won friends and votes\r\nnot only over her own district of Ulster, but in many other\r\nquarters of Ireland; and often when in England some indefinable\r\ntorpor has crept over a meeting--as will happen at times--a few\r\neloquent and heart-stirring words from her have been sufficient to\r\nraise the courage and revive the interest.\r\n\r\n[548] Mrs. Peter A. Taylor, Mrs. Fawcett, Mrs. Lucas, Miss Biggs,\r\nMiss Rhoda Garrett, Miss Jessie Boucherett, Mrs. Arthur Arnold,\r\nMiss Frances Power Cobbe, Lady Harberton, Mrs. Pennington, Miss\r\nHelen Taylor, step-daughter of John Stuart Mill, Miss Henrietta\r\nMueller, member of the London school-board, and others.\r\n\r\n[549] Mrs. Jacob Bright, Miss Becker, Mrs. Scatcherd, Miss Corbutt,\r\nMr. Steinthal, Mrs. Thomasson, and others.\r\n\r\n[550] Led by Mrs. Lillias Ashworth Hallett, Mrs. Helen Bright\r\nClark, niece and daughter of John Bright, Mrs. Beddoe, Miss Snyder,\r\nMiss Estlin, the Priestman sisters, Miss Blackburn and Miss Colby,\r\nEliza Sturge, Mrs. Ashford, Mrs. Matthews.

At the close of the meeting the enthusiastic and\r\nprolonged cheering which rose from the crowd, the cordial\r\nhand-shakes of utter strangers with words of encouragement and\r\nsympathy brought tears to the eyes of many who had the privilege of\r\nbeing present on that occasion.\r\n\r\n[552] Mrs. McLaren occupied the chair and was accompanied by Mrs.\r\nNichol, Miss Wigham, Miss Tod, Mrs. Charles McLaren, Miss Craigen,\r\nMiss Becker, Miss Beddoe, Mrs. Shearer (formerly Miss Helena\r\nDowning), Miss Flora Stevenson, Mrs. Wellstood, Miss Annie\r\nStoddart, Mrs. Burton and a distinguished visitor from New York,\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who was able on this visit to England\r\nto estimate the wide difference in the position of women since the\r\ntime--more than forty years before--she had been refused a seat as\r\na delegate in the World's Anti-Slavery Convention in London.\r\n\r\n[553] MARRIED WOMEN'S PROPERTY COMMITTEE.--The committee, at the\r\ntime of the final meeting, November 18, 1882, consisted of the\r\nfollowing ladies and gentlemen: Mrs. Addey; Mr. Arthur Arnold, M.\r\nP.; Mrs. Arthur Arnold; Mr. Jacob Bright, M.

Taylor; Mrs.\r\nVenturi; Miss Alice Wilson; Miss Lucy Wilson; _Treasurer_, Mrs.\r\nJacob Bright. _Secretary_, Mrs. Wolstenholme Elmy.\r\n\r\nThe immediate passage of this bill was in a large measure due to\r\nMrs. Jacob Bright, who was unwearied in her efforts, in rolling up\r\npetitions, scattering tracts, holding meetings, and in company with\r\nher husband having private interviews with members of parliament.\r\nFor ten consecutive years she gave her special attention to this\r\nbill. I had the pleasure of attending the meeting of congratulation\r\nNovember 18, and heard a very charming address from Mrs. Bright on\r\nthe success of the measure. Mr. Jacob Bright and other members of\r\nthe committee spoke with equal effect.--[E. C.

The third resolution, the adoption of\r\npetitions, was moved by Miss S. S. Mair, a grand-niece of Mrs.\r\nSiddons, and Mrs. Lindsay of Glasgow.\r\n\r\nBATH, GUILD HALL.--Presided over by the mayor. Among other speakers\r\nwere Mrs. Beddoe, Miss Becker, Mrs. Jeffrey and Mrs. Ashworth\r\nHallet.\r\n\r\nNEWCASTLE, TOWN HALL.--Followed on April 21, under the presidency\r\nof the mayor. The crowd was so great that an overflow meeting had\r\nto be arranged. The speakers were Mrs. Ashton Dilke, Miss Tod, Mrs.\r\nEva McLaren and Mrs. Scatcherd. The audience was largely composed\r\nof miners and working people, and the enthusiasm manifested was\r\nstriking. A Newcastle paper reports that this was the first\r\noccasion on which Mrs. Ashton Dilke had appeared in public since\r\nher husband's death, and tears glistened in many eyes as the men\r\nwho were his constituents welcomed her among them once more. Some\r\nminers walked twelve miles to hear her and twelve miles back after\r\nthe meeting, who had to go down the pit at 3 o'clock next morning.\r\nSome could not get in, and pleaded piteously for an overflow\r\nmeeting. \"We have come a long way to hear Mistress Dilke; do bring\r\nher.\" Some women after hearing Miss Tod said: \"She's worth hearing\r\ntwice, is that,\" and insisted on following her to the overflow\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nLONDON, ST. JAMES HALL.--Three days later there was a great meeting\r\npresided over by Sir Richard Temple G. C. S. I., and addressed by\r\nMr. W. Summers, M. P., Mrs. Fawcett, the Rt. Hon. Jas. Stansfeld,\r\nM.

For some time she\r\nkept her doors barred against the coarse minions of the law, but\r\nultimately they entered the house, seized her goods and carried\r\nthem off to be sold at public auction, but they were bought in by\r\nfriends next day. Miss Charlotte E. Hall and Miss Babb have\r\nprotested and resisted taxation for many years.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Miss Mueller's example will be followed by many\r\nothers next year. This quiet form of protest used to be very\r\ngenerally followed by members of the society of Friends, and must\r\ncommand the sympathy of our co-workers in the United States, who\r\ndate their national existence from their refusal to submit to\r\ntaxation without representation.--[E.

AIME\r\n          MARTIN.\r\n\r\n          There is nothing, I think, which marks more decidedly the\r\n          character of men or of nations, than the manner in which\r\n          they treat women.--[HERDER.\r\n\r\n     The Woman Question in the Back-ground--In France the Agitation\r\n     Dates from the Upheaval of 1789--International Women's Rights\r\n     Convention in Paris, 1878--Mlle.

If, however, he looks simply for an earnest of the\r\nfuture, for a humble beginning of that wonderful revolution in\r\nfavor of women which has occurred in the United States, and to a\r\nless degree in England, during the past quarter of a century, his\r\nexpectations will be fully realized. More than this; he will close\r\nthis long account of woman's emancipation in the new world\r\nconvinced that in due season a similar blessing is to be enjoyed by\r\nthe women of the old world.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, the woman question in Europe is pushed into the\r\nbackground by the all-absorbing struggle still going on in various\r\nforms between the republican and monarchical principle, between the\r\nvital present and the moribund past; but the most superficial\r\nobserver must perceive, that the amelioration of the lamentable\r\nsituation of European womanhood is sure to be one of the first\r\nproblems to come to the front for resolution, as soon as liberty\r\ngains undisputed control on this continent,--a victory assured in\r\nthe not-distant future. When men shall have secured their rights,\r\nthe battle will be half won; women's rights will follow as a\r\nnatural sequence.\r\n\r\nThe most logical beginning for a sketch of the woman movement on\r\nthe continent, and indeed of any step in advance, is of course\r\nFrance, where ideas, not facts, stand out the more prominently;\r\nfor, in questions of reform, the abstract must always precede the\r\nconcrete,--public opinion must be convinced before it will accept\r\nan innovation. This has been the _role_ of France in Europe ever\r\nsince the great revolution; it is her _role_ to-day. She is the\r\nagitator of the old world, and agitation is the lever of reform.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: George Sand]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe woman movement in France dates from the upheaval of 1789.\r\nThough the demands for the rights of man threw all other claims\r\ninto the shade, a few women did not fail to perceive that they also\r\nhad interests at stake. Marie Olympe de Gouges, for example, in her\r\n\"Declaration of the Rights of Woman,\" vindicated for her sex all\r\nthe liberties proclaimed in the famous \"Declaration of the Rights\r\nof Man.\" During the empire and the restoration the reform slept;\r\nunder the July monarchy there was an occasional murmur, which burst\r\nforth into a vigorous protest when the revolution of 1848 awakened\r\nthe aspirations of 1789, and George Sand consecrated her talent to\r\nthe cause of progress. During the second empire, in spite of the\r\noppressive nature of the government, the movement took on a more\r\ndefinite form; its advocates became more numerous; and men and\r\nwomen who held high places in literature, politics and journalism,\r\nspoke out plainly in favor of ameliorating the condition of French\r\nwomen. Then came the third republic, with more freedom than France\r\nhad enjoyed since the beginning of the century. The woman movement\r\nfelt the change, and, during the past ten years, its friends have\r\nbeen more active than ever before.\r\n\r\nThe most tangible event in the history of the question in France is\r\nthe International Woman's Rights Congress, the first international\r\ngathering of the kind, which assembled in Paris in the months of\r\nJuly and August during the exposition season of 1878. The committee\r\nwhich called the congress contained representatives from six\r\ndifferent countries, viz.: France, Switzerland, Italy, Holland,\r\nRussia and America. Among the eighteen members from France were two\r\nsenators, five deputies and three Paris municipal councilors. Italy\r\nwas represented by a deputy and the Countess of Travers, an\r\nindefatigable friend of the undertaking, who died just before the\r\nopening of the congress. The American members of the committee were\r\nJulia Ward Howe, Mary A. Livermore and Theodore Stanton. Among the\r\nmembers[567] of the congress, besides those just mentioned, were\r\ndeputies, senators, publicists, journalists, and men and women of\r\nletters from all parts of Europe. Sixteen different organizations\r\nin Europe and America sent delegates. The National Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation was represented by Jane Graham Jones and Theodore\r\nStanton, and the American Woman Suffrage Association by Julia Ward\r\nHowe.\r\n\r\nThe work of the congress was divided into five sections, as\r\nfollows: the historical, the educational, the economic, the moral,\r\nand the legislative. The congress was opened on July 25, by Leon\r\nRicher, its promoter and originator, and one of the most\r\nindefatigable friends of women's rights in France. He invited Maria\r\nDeraismes, an able speaker well known among Paris reformers, to act\r\nas temporary chairman. The next thing in order was the election of\r\ntwo permanent presidents, a man and a woman. The late M. Antide\r\nMartin, then an influential member of the Paris municipal council,\r\nand Julia Ward Howe were chosen. Mrs. Howe, on taking the chair,\r\nmade a short speech which was very well received; Anna Maria\r\nMozzoni, of Milan, a most eloquent orator, followed; and then\r\nGenevieve Graham Jones advanced to the platform, and in the name of\r\nher mother, Jane Graham Jones, delegate of the National Woman\r\nSuffrage Association, she conveyed to the congress messages of\r\ngood-will from the United States. This address, delivered with much\r\nfeeling, and appealing to French patriotism, was enthusiastically\r\nreceived. When Miss Jones had taken her seat, M. Martin arose,\r\nthanked the foreign ladies for their admirable words, and concluded\r\nin these terms: \"In the name of my compatriots, I particularly\r\nreturn gratitude to Miss Graham Jones for the eloquent and cordial\r\nmanner in which she has just referred to France, and in turn, I\r\nsalute republican America, which so often offers Europe examples of\r\ngood sense, wisdom and liberty.\"\r\n\r\nAt the second session was read a long and eloquent letter from\r\nSalvatore Morelli,[568] the Italian deputy. Theodore Stanton read a\r\npaper entitled, \"The Woman Movement in the United States.\" The\r\nthird session was devoted to the educational phase of the woman\r\nquestion. Tony Revillon, who has since become one of the radical\r\ndeputies of Paris, spoke, and Miss Hotchkiss presented an able\r\nreport on \"The Education of Women in America.\" After Miss Hotchkiss\r\nhad finished, Auguste Desmoulins, now a member of the Paris\r\nmunicipal council, offered, as president of the section, a\r\nresolution advocating the principal reforms--the same studies for\r\nboys and girls, and coeducation--demanded by Miss Hotchkiss. The\r\nresolution was carried without debate. Aurelia Cimino Folliero de\r\nLuna, of Florence, followed in a few remarks on the \"Mission of\r\nWoman.\" Eugenie Pierre, of Paris, spoke on the \"Vices of Education\r\nin Different Classes of Society,\" and in closing complimented\r\nAmerica in the highest terms for its progressive position on the\r\nwoman question. In fact, the example of the United States was\r\nfrequently cited throughout the proceedings of this congress, and\r\nthe reformers of America may find some joy in feeling that their\r\nlabors are producing fruit even in the old world.\r\n\r\nAt the last session of the congress, August 9, 1878, a permanent\r\ninternational committee was announced. France, England, Italy,\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, Switzerland, Germany, Holland, Sweden, Poland,\r\nRussia, Roumania and the United States are all represented on this\r\ncommittee.[569] The chief duties of this committee were to be the\r\nadvancement of the reforms demanded by the congress and to issue\r\nthe call for the next international gathering. The congress ended\r\nwith a grand banquet on the evening of the last day's session, in\r\nwhich about two hundred guests participated.\r\n\r\nThe present situation in France is full of interest and\r\nencouragement. There are societies, journals, and different groups\r\nof reformers all striving independently but earnestly to better the\r\nsituation of French women politically, civilly, morally and\r\nintellectually. At the head of the agitation in favor of women's\r\npolitical rights stand Hubertine Auclert and her vigorous monthly,\r\n_La Citoyenne_[570]; the reformers of the code are lead by Leon\r\nRicher and his outspoken monthly, _Le Droit des Femmes_[571]; the\r\nmovement in favor of divorce, which was crowned with success in the\r\nsummer of 1884, is headed by Alfred Naquet in the senate, and finds\r\none of its earliest and ablest supporters in Olympe Audouard; the\r\nemancipation of women from priestly domination--and herein lies the\r\ngreatest and most dangerous obstacle that the reformers\r\nencounter--counts among its many advocates Maria Deraismes; woman's\r\nmoral improvement, to be mainly accomplished by the abolition of\r\nlegalized prostitution, is demanded by Dr. and Mrs. Chapman and\r\nEmilie de Morsier; while the great uprising in favor of woman's\r\neducation has such a host of friends and has already produced such\r\ngrand results, that the brief limits of this sketch will permit\r\nneither an enumeration of the one nor the other.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe transition from France to Italy is easy and natural, for it is\r\non the Cisalpine peninsula that Gallic ideas have always taken\r\ndeeper root than elsewhere on the Continent, and, as might be\r\nexpected, the Italian woman movement resembles in many respects\r\nthat of which we have just spoken.\r\n\r\nWith the formation of the kingdom of Italy in 1870 began a\r\nwell-defined agitation in favor of Italian women. The educational\r\nquestion was first taken up. Prominent among the women who\r\nparticipated in this movement were Laura Mantegazza, the\r\nMarchioness Brigida Tanari, and Alessandrina Ravizza. Aurelia\r\nCimino Folliero de Luna, who has devoted her whole life to\r\nimproving the condition of her countrywomen, writes me from\r\nFlorence on this subject. \"Here it was,\" she says, \"that the\r\nexample of American and English women, who in this respect were\r\nour superiors, was useful to us. While we were still under foreign\r\ndomination and ignorant of solidarity of sex, they were free and\r\nunited.\" The new political life produced a number of able women\r\norators and writers, such as Anna Mozzoni, Malvina Frank, Gualberta\r\nBeccari, and many others. The last named founded at Venice _La\r\nDonna_, and in 1872 Aurelia Cimino Folliero de Luna established in\r\nFlorence _La Cornelia_, which has since ceased to exist, while in\r\n1882 Ernesta Napollon began at Naples the publication of the\r\nshort-lived _L'Umanitario_, the youngest of a goodly list of\r\njournals which have done much to excite an interest in the woman\r\nquestion. The Italian government has generously seconded the\r\nefforts of the reformers. The code has been modified, schools have\r\nbeen established, the universities thrown open and courses in\r\nagriculture proposed.\r\n\r\nBut the most significant sign of progress in Italy was afforded by\r\nthe great universal suffrage convention, held at Rome on February\r\n11, 12, 1881. Anna Mozzoni, delegate to the convention from the\r\nMilan Society for the Promotion of Woman's Interests, of which she\r\nis the able president, made an eloquent appeal for woman suffrage\r\nand introduced a resolution to this effect which was carried by a\r\ngood majority.[572] In 1876 a committee of the Chamber, of which\r\nthe deputy Peruzzi was chairman, reported a bill in favor of\r\nconferring on women the right to vote on municipal and provincial\r\nquestions (_voto amministrativo_), a privilege which they had\r\nformerly enjoyed in Lombardy and Venice under Austrian rule. This\r\nbill was reintroduced in 1882 by the Depretis ministry and was\r\nreported upon favorably by the proper committee in June, 1884. It\r\nis believed that the proposition will soon become a law. If such is\r\nthe case, Italian women will enjoy the same rights as Italian men\r\nin municipal and provincial affairs, with this exception, that they\r\nwill not be eligible to office in the bodies of which they are\r\nelectors.[573] Aurelia Cimino Folliero de Luna, says:\r\n\r\n     I make no doubt that in a few years the question of the\r\n     emancipation of women in Italy will be better understood; will be\r\n     regarded from a more elevated standpoint and will receive a more\r\n     general and greater support; for if we turn to the past, we shall\r\n     be astonished at what has already been accomplished in this\r\n     direction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConcepcion Arenal, the distinguished Spanish authoress, signals\r\nseveral signs of progress in her country. This lady writes:\r\n\r\n     In the schools founded by the Madrid Association for the\r\n     Education of Women, nearly five hundred girls pursue courses in\r\n     pedagogics, commercial studies, modern languages, painting, etc.\r\n     This instruction, for the most part gratis, is given by\r\n     professors who devote their time and strength to this noble\r\n     object without receiving any remuneration,--worthy continuators\r\n     of the grand work of the founder of the Madrid high-school for\r\n     women, Fernando de Castro, of blessed memory, one of the most\r\n     philanthropic men I ever met, who so loved mankind that his name\r\n     should be known in every land. Nine hundred and eighteen girls\r\n     attended the session of 1880-1881 of the school of music and\r\n     declamation at Madrid, and the number has since increased.\r\n\r\n     A few years ago a school of arts and trades was founded at the\r\n     capital, and women were admitted to the classes in drawing. In\r\n     1881, one hundred and thirty availed themselves of this\r\n     privilege. In 1882, one hundred and fifty-four female students\r\n     were present at the institutions (_institutos_) for intermediate\r\n     education in Spain. The coeducation of the sexes, therefore, is\r\n     not unknown to us. In that year Valencia, Barcelona, Gerona and\r\n     Seville each counted sixteen, while the single girl at Mahon\r\n     discontinued her studies on the ground that she preferred not to\r\n     mingle with boys. At Malaga, the only female aspirant for the\r\n     bachelor's degree took seven prizes, and was \"excellent\" in all\r\n     her studies. During the academic year, 1881-1882, twelve women\r\n     attended lectures in the Spanish universities. The three at\r\n     Madrid were all working for the doctorate, and one had passed the\r\n     necessary examinations; the two at Valladolid were occupied with\r\n     medicine, while at Barcelona five were studying medicine, one\r\n     law, and one pharmacy. Three of the medical students have passed\r\n     their examinations, but instead of the degrees, which are refused\r\n     them, they are granted certificates which do not allow them to\r\n     practice.\r\n\r\n     Our public opinion is progressing, as is evidenced by the laws,\r\n     and especially by the educational reforms, which are the\r\n     exclusive work of men. The council of public instruction, a\r\n     consulting body holding by no means advanced ideas, was called\r\n     upon a short time ago, to decide whether the university\r\n     certificates conferred upon women could be converted into regular\r\n     degrees, which would entitle the recipients to the enjoyment of\r\n     the privileges attached to these titles. The learned council\r\n     discussed, hesitated, tried to decide the question, but finally\r\n     left it in a situation which was neither clear nor conclusive.\r\n     This hesitancy and vagueness are very significant; a few years\r\n     ago a negative decision would have been given promptly and in the\r\n     plainest terms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPortugal is following closely upon the steps of Spain, and, in the\r\nformer as in the latter country, it is in the department of\r\neducation that the most marked signs of an awakening are to be\r\nfound. Rodrigues de Freitas, the well-known publicist and\r\nrepublican statesman of Porto, says:\r\n\r\n     There is not a single intermediate school for girls in all\r\n     Portugal. In 1883, the Portugese parliament took up the subject\r\n     of intermediate instruction, and discussed the question in its\r\n     relation to women, and the progress in this direction realized in\r\n     France during the last few years. A deputy who opposed the\r\n     reform, recalled the words of Jules Simon, pronounced in a recent\r\n     sitting of the council of public instruction at Paris. The\r\n     philosopher remarked:\r\n\r\n          We are here a few old men, very fortunate gentlemen, in\r\n          being excused from having to marry the girls you propose to\r\n          bring up.\r\n\r\n     Our minister of the interior, who has charge of public\r\n     instruction, followed, and declared that he was in favor of the\r\n     establishment of girls' colleges. He said:\r\n\r\n          It is true that M. Jules Simon considers himself fortunate\r\n          in not having to marry a girl educated in a French college;\r\n          but I think I have discovered the reason for this aversion.\r\n          He is getting in his dotage, otherwise he would experience\r\n          no repugnance in proposing to such a girl, provided, of\r\n          course, that, along with an education, she was at the same\r\n          time pretty and virtuous.\r\n\r\n     The chamber laughed. And such is the situation to-day: the\r\n     minister favorable to the better instruction of women, while\r\n     neither minister nor deputies make an earnest effort to bring it\r\n     about.\r\n\r\n     This dark picture is relieved, however, by one or two bright\r\n     touches. There are many private boarding schools where families\r\n     in easy circumstances send their daughters, who learn to speak\r\n     several languages, are taught a little elementary mathematics and\r\n     geography, and acquire a few accomplishments. Some of the pupils\r\n     of these institutions pass with credit the examinations of the\r\n     boys' lyceums or colleges. Article 72, of the law of June 14,\r\n     1880, on intermediate instruction, reads as follows: \"Students of\r\n     the female sex, who wish to enter the State schools, or pass the\r\n     examinations of said schools, come within the provisions of this\r\n     law, except as regards the regulations concerning boarding\r\n     scholars.\" That is to say, girls enjoy in the State intermediate\r\n     schools the same privileges as male day scholars. Many girls have\r\n     availed themselves of this opportunity and have passed the lyceum\r\n     examinations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCrossing the Rhine into the Teutonic countries, we find less\r\nprogress on the whole, than among the Latin races. Germany,\r\nhowever, if behind France and Italy, is far ahead of Spain and\r\nPortugal. The agitation is divided into two currents: the Leipsic\r\nand the Berlin movements. The former is the older, the General\r\nAssociation of German Women having been founded in Leipsic in\r\nOctober, 1865. Louise Otto-Peters, the prime mover in the\r\norganization of this association, may be considered the originator\r\nof the German movement. A novelist of much power, whose stories all\r\nteach a lesson in socialism, she established in 1848, the year of\r\nthe great revolutionary fermentation throughout Europe, the first\r\npaper which advocated the interests of women in Germany. The aims\r\nof the Leipsic and Berlin reformers were of an economic and\r\neducational nature. It was felt that the time had come when woman\r\nmust have wider and better paid fields of work, and when she must\r\nbe more thoroughly educated in order to be able the easier to gain\r\nher livelihood. A paper, _New Paths_ (_Neue Bahnen_), was\r\nestablished as the organ of the association. It still exists. The\r\nplan of holding annual conventions--much like those which have been\r\nin progress in America for so many years--in the chief cities of\r\nGermany was settled upon, and numerous meetings of this kind have\r\nalready occurred. At these gatherings all questions pertaining to\r\nwoman's advancement are discussed, and auxiliary associations\r\norganized. The General Association of German Women has sent several\r\npetitions to the Reichstag, or imperial parliament, demanding\r\nvarious reforms and innovations. The principal members of the\r\nassociation are Louise Otto-Peters, the president and editor of the\r\n_Neue Bahnen_; Henriette Goldschmidt, the most effective speaker of\r\nthe group; and Mrs. Winter, the treasurer, all of whom live in\r\nLeipsic; Miss Menzzer of Dresden; Lina Morgenstern, the well-known\r\nBerlin philanthropist; and Marie Calm of Cassel, perhaps the most\r\nradical of the body, whose ideas on woman suffrage are much the\r\nsame as those entertained in England and the United States. In\r\nfact, an American is frequently struck by the similarity between\r\nmany of the features of the General Association of German Women,\r\nand the Woman's Rights Association in the United States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Berlin movement, which resembles that of Leipsic in everything\r\nexcept that it is rather more conservative, owes its origin to that\r\ndistinguished philanthropist, Dr. Adolf Lette. The Lette Verein, or\r\nLette Society, so called in honor of its founder, was organized in\r\nDecember, 1865, but a few months after the establishment of the\r\nLeipsic association. The object of the society is, as has already\r\nbeen said, to improve the material condition of women, especially\r\npoor women, by giving them a better education, by teaching them\r\nmanual employments, by helping to establish them in business--in a\r\nword, by affording them the means to support themselves. The Lette\r\nSociety has become the nucleus of similar organizations scattered\r\nall over the German empire. Its organ, the _German Woman's\r\nAdvocate_ (_Deutcher Frauenanwalt_), is a well-conducted little\r\nmonthly, edited by the secretary of the society, Jenny Hirsch. Anna\r\nSchepeler-Lette, daughter of the founder, has been for many years\r\nand is still at the head of this admirable society. She writes me:\r\n\r\n     If we are asked whether we would have women enter public life,\r\n     whether we would wish them to become professors in the\r\n     university, clergymen in the church, and lawyers at the bar, as\r\n     is the case in America, we should make no response, for they are\r\n     but idle questions. These demands have not yet been made in\r\n     Germany, nor will they be made for a long time to come, if ever.\r\n     But why peer into the future? We have to-day many institutions,\r\n     many customs, which past centuries would have looked upon as\r\n     contrary to Divine and human law. In this connection we would say\r\n     with Sancho Panza: \"What is, is able to be.\"\r\n\r\nThe German philosopher, Herr von Kirchmann, is more decided in his\r\nviews concerning the future of his countrywomen. In one of his last\r\nworks, entitled \"Questions and Dangers of the Hour\" (_Zeitfragen\r\nund Abenteuer_) is a chapter on \"Women in the Past and Future,\"\r\nwhere it is shown that the female sex has been gradually gaining\r\nits freedom, and the prediction is made that the day is near at\r\nhand when women will obtain their complete independence and will\r\ncompete with men in every department of life, not excepting\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTurning to the other great Germanic nation, Austria, we find still\r\nless progress than in the north. In fact, the movement in the south\r\nis little more than a question of woman's self-support. The\r\nimportant problem of woman's education is not yet resolved in\r\nGermany, and in Austria still less has been done. \"In two\r\nparticulars,\" writes a Berlin correspondent, \"Austria may be said\r\nto be in advance of Germany. The admission of women to the\r\nuniversity does not present such insurmountable difficulties, and\r\nher employment in railroad, post, and telegraph offices does not\r\nencounter such strong opposition.\" But it must not be supposed from\r\nthis statement that the Austrian universities are open to women.\r\n\"Our universities are shut against women,\" Professor Wendt, of\r\nTroppau, informs me; \"but they may pass the same examinations as\r\nboys who have finished their preparatory studies, though it is\r\ndistinctly stated in the women's diplomas that they may not\r\ncontinue their studies in the university.\" The professors, however,\r\nsometimes allow foreign girls to attend lectures. Professor Bruhl,\r\nof Vienna, for example, has lectured to men and women on anatomy.\r\nThe Academy of Fine Arts at Vienna is not open to women, though the\r\nConservatory of Music is much frequented by them. In 1880, in fact,\r\nthree women received prizes for musical compositions. Johanna\r\nLeitenberger, of Salzburg, writes:\r\n\r\n     Several newspapers are devoted to the different phases of the\r\n     woman's movement in Austria. Some years ago an ex-officer,\r\n     Captain A. D. Korn, who, if I am not mistaken, had passed some\r\n     time in England and America, founded the _Women's Universal\r\n     Journal_ (_Allgemeine Frauen Zeitung_). This newspaper was wholly\r\n     devoted to women's interest, but it soon died. The same thing is\r\n     true of the _Women's Journal_ (_Frauenblaetter_) of Gratz, which\r\n     appeared for a short time under my editorship. * * * * On October\r\n     9, 10, 11, 1872, the third German women's convention (_Deutsche\r\n     Frauenkonferenz_) was held at Vienna, under the auspices of the\r\n     general society for popular education and the amelioration of\r\n     women's condition. The other two sittings of this society had\r\n     been held at Leipsic and Stuttgart. The soul of this new movement\r\n     was Captain Korn, whom I have already mentioned. His study of the\r\n     woman question in the United States may have prompted him to\r\n     awaken a similar agitation among the women of the Austrian\r\n     empire. Addresses were delivered at this convention by ladies\r\n     from Vienna, Hungary, Bohemia and Styria and all the various\r\n     interests of women were discussed. * * * * The proceedings of the\r\n     convention attracted considerable attention, and produced\r\n     favorable impressions on the audience, which was recruited from\r\n     the better classes of the population. But the newspapers of\r\n     Vienna ridiculed the young movement, its friends grew lukewarm,\r\n     and every trace was soon lost of this first and last Austrian\r\n     women's rights convention.\r\n\r\nIn one important particular the Austro-Hungarian empire treats\r\nwomen more fairly than is the case in other European countries.\r\nElise Krasnohorska, the Bohemian author, writes me:\r\n\r\n     Women have a voice in the municipal, provincial and national\r\n     elections, though male citizens duly authorized by them cast\r\n     their vote. With this single reserve--a very important one, it\r\n     must be confessed--our women are politically the equals of men.\r\n     At Prague, however, this is not the case. The Bohemian capital\r\n     preserves an ancient privilege which is in contradiction to the\r\n     Austrian electoral law, and which excludes us from the elective\r\n     franchise. Universal suffrage does not exist in the empire, but\r\n     the payment of a certain amount of taxes confers the right to\r\n     vote. I do not enter into the details of the electoral law, which\r\n     is somewhat complicated, which has its exceptions and\r\n     contradictions, and is in fact an apple of discord in Austria in\r\n     more than one respect; but, speaking generally, it may be said\r\n     that a woman who owns property, who is in business, or who pays\r\n     taxes, may designate a citizen possessing her confidence to\r\n     represent her at the polls. Our women are satisfied with this\r\n     system, and prefer it to casting their ballot in person.\r\n\r\n     It may be said, also, that women are eligible to office, or at\r\n     least that there is no law against their accepting it, while\r\n     there are instances of their having done so. In southern\r\n     Bohemia, a short time ago, a countess was chosen member of a\r\n     provincial assembly (_okresni zastupitestvo_) with the approval\r\n     of the body, on the condition that she should not participate\r\n     personally in its deliberations, but should be represented by a\r\n     man having full power to act for her. At Agram in Croatia, a\r\n     woman was elected, a few years ago, member of the municipal\r\n     council, and no objection was made. Of course such cases are very\r\n     rare, but they have their significance.\r\n\r\nCarolina Svetla, the distinguished poet and author, has done,\r\nperhaps, the most to awaken thought on the woman question in\r\nBohemia. She stands at the head of a talented group of literary\r\nwomen, which plays a brilliant part in the fatherland of Huss. The\r\nmeans for woman's instruction, however, are most lamentable in\r\nBohemia. The universities are shut against women, and though two\r\nwomen have been graduated in Switzerland, their degrees are not\r\nrecognized in their native land. Beyond primary instruction the\r\nState does almost nothing for its women, though they outnumber the\r\nother sex by two hundred thousand. In several of the large cities\r\nof Bohemia something has been accomplished for girls' high-school\r\nand normal-school instruction; but, in general, we may say that the\r\nintellectual development of Bohemian girls is left to private\r\ninstruction. Associations of women have done much to fill this\r\nvoid, one of which, founded by Carolina Svetla, is devoted to the\r\nindustrial and commercial instruction of girls. Two thousand women\r\nbelong to this association, and five hundred girls attend its\r\nschool annually, while many young women frequent its school for the\r\ntraining of nurses. This vigorous organization has disarmed\r\nprejudices by the success of its schools and by the arguments of\r\nits monthly organ, the _Zenske Listy_, ably edited by Elise\r\nKrasnohorska, one of the best known Bohemian poets, and a leader in\r\nthe work of improving the condition of her countrywomen. Vojta\r\nNaprstek, a man who has justly been named \"the woman's advocate,\"\r\nhas founded at Prague the Women's American Club, whose object is\r\ncharity and the intellectual elevation of women, and has presented\r\nthe club a valuable collection of books and objects of art. A lady,\r\nwriting me from Prague, says:\r\n\r\n     The club has always been in a most flourishing condition,\r\n     although it has never had a constitution or by-laws to hold it\r\n     together,--nothing but the single bond of philanthropy. At first\r\n     it had not even a name. But outsiders began to call its members\r\n     'the Americans,' because they adopted American improvements in\r\n     their homes. The appellation was accepted by the club as an\r\n     honorable title, and from that time it formally called itself the\r\n     \"American Club.\"\r\n\r\nThe Austrian code, in its treatment of women, is unsurpassed in\r\ncontradictions. Women, for example, may testify in criminal\r\nactions, but they may not be witnesses to the simplest legal\r\ndocument. There are many absurdities of this sort in the existing\r\nlaw which were unknown in the ancient code of independent Bohemia,\r\nwhich was more liberal in its treatment of women. Divorce exists,\r\nbut divorced persons cannot marry again. Bohemia being a part of\r\nAustria, women vote in the same way as has already been mentioned\r\nin what was said of the latter country. But at Prague, however,\r\nwomen do not vote, the capital still retaining its old laws on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nConcerning the other grand division of the empire of the Hapsburgs,\r\nHungary, much the same may be said as of Bohemia. It is only within\r\nthe last forty years that Hungary has striven to attain to the\r\nlevel of occidental civilization and culture, so that the question\r\nof the amelioration of women's condition is of very recent origin\r\nin that country. Rose Revai, of Budapest, writes:\r\n\r\n     Hungarian legislators have always treated us favorably in all\r\n     matters pertaining to the family, marriage and inheritance. By\r\n     the mere act of marriage we attain our majority and are\r\n     emancipated from tutelage. As heirs, our interests are not\r\n     forgotten, and as widows, we have the control over our own\r\n     children. In business and trade we enjoy equal rights with men.\r\n     And Hungarian women have not been slow to take advantage of these\r\n     privileges, as is shown by those of our sex who occupy worthy\r\n     positions in literature, art, commerce, industry, the theater and\r\n     the school-room.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Hungarian universities are still closed against women,\r\nthere are many girls' industrial and normal schools and colleges.\r\nThe impetus given to female education in Hungary is chiefly\r\ndue to the late Baron Joseph Eoetvoes, the savant, poet and\r\nphilanthropist, who was minister of public instruction in 1867.\r\nWomen are employed in the postal and telegraphic service.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReturning north, to Holland, we find much the same situation as\r\nin the other Teutonic nations. \"The women of Holland are\r\nunquestionably better educated, and entertain as a body more\r\nliberal ideas than French women,\" said a Dutch lady to me, who had\r\nlived many years at Paris; \"but, on the other hand, there is not\r\nthe little group of women in the Netherlands who grasp the real\r\nmeaning of the woman question as is the case here in France.\"\r\nWoman's social position is a little better in Holland than in the\r\nCatholic countries. In 1870 an essay on the woman question \"by a\r\nlady\" demanded political rights for women, and there are a few\r\ninstances of women having lectured on that subject. The Dutch\r\nuniversities are open to female students, and Aletta Henriette\r\nJacobs, the first and only female physician in Holland, has a\r\nsuccessful practice at Amsterdam. Dr. Jacobs recently attempted to\r\nvote, and carried the question before the courts. Elise A.\r\nHaighton, of Amsterdam, writes:\r\n\r\n     A few of our women do not hesitate to participate in political\r\n     and social discussions. The Union (_Unic_), a society which aims\r\n     to promote popular interest in politics by meetings, debates,\r\n     tracts, etc.; the Daybreak (_Dageraad_), a radical association\r\n     which holds very ultra opinions on politics, religion and\r\n     science, and supports a magazine to which many scientific men\r\n     contribute; and the New Malthusian Band, an organization\r\n     sufficiently explained by its name, all count several women among\r\n     their members.\r\n\r\nElise van Calcar, the veteran Dutch authoress, sums up the\r\nsituation in Holland, as follows:\r\n\r\n     I am sorry to have to confess that, as regards the general\r\n     emancipation of women, we have accomplished but very little. Our\r\n     work is indirect; we can only proclaim the injustice of our\r\n     position.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo countries, the product of Latin and Teutonic civilization,\r\nBelgium and Switzerland, must be touched upon before we turn to the\r\nScandinavian people. Of the first, Belgium, about the same may be\r\nsaid as of Holland with which she was so long united politically. A\r\ncorrespondent in Belgium writes me as follows:\r\n\r\n     There cannot be said to be any movement in this country in favor\r\n     of the emancipation of women. No journal, no association, no\r\n     organization of any kind exists.\r\n\r\nBut public opinion is said to be quite favorable. Women are making\r\ntheir way slowly into certain callings. The professors of the\r\nuniversities of Liege and Ghent, when asked their opinion not long\r\nago by the minister of public instruction, expressed a desire to\r\nsee women admitted to the privileges of these institutions on the\r\nsame terms as men, and to-day female students are found at all the\r\ninstitutions for higher education. Another correspondent writes:\r\n\r\n     Within the past few years an effort has been made among the women\r\n     of the middle classes in the large cities, and secondary and\r\n     professional schools have been established for girls, which are\r\n     already producing good fruit. This movement is beginning to make\r\n     itself felt among the upper classes, and it is to be hoped that\r\n     the next generation will make longer strides in the direction of\r\n     instruction than is the case with the present generation.\r\n\r\nIn one respect at least Belgium is far behind her neighbor,\r\nHolland. Dr. Isala van Diest, the first and so far the only female\r\nphysician in Belgium, although she has passed successfully all the\r\nnecessary examinations and taken all the necessary degrees, may not\r\npractice medicine in her own country. She wrote me recently:\r\n\r\n     I fear I shall soon be obliged to give up the fight and go to\r\n     France, England or Holland, unless I wish to lose the fruit of\r\n     all my studies.\r\n\r\nConcerning the higher education of women Dr. van Diest writes:\r\n\r\n     There existed in Belgium some years ago a law which required\r\n     students who would enter the university, to pass the examination\r\n     of graduate in letters (_gradue-en-lettres_). Candidates for this\r\n     degree were expected to know how to translate Greek and write\r\n     Latin. But as there were no schools where girls could study the\r\n     dead languages with the thoroughness of boys who were trained six\r\n     years in the classics, the former were almost entirely shut out\r\n     from enjoying the advantages of an university course. This\r\n     _graduat_, however, no longer exists, and the entrance of women\r\n     into our universities is now possible. Female students are found\r\n     to-day at Brussels, Liege and Ghent, but their number is still\r\n     very small. It was in 1880 that the first woman entered the\r\n     university of Brussels, but it was not until 1883 that their\r\n     admission became general. They pursue, for the most part,\r\n     scientific studies, thereby securing more lucrative positions as\r\n     teachers, and pass their examinations for graduation with\r\n     success.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland being made up of more than a score of separate cantons\r\nclosely resembling our States in their political organization, it\r\nis difficult to arrive at the exact situation throughout the whole\r\ncountry--small though it be. However, generally speaking, it may be\r\nsaid that the Helvetic republic has remained almost a passive\r\nspectator of the woman movement, though a few signs of progress are\r\nworthy of note. The Catholic cantons lag behind those that have\r\nadopted Protestantism, and the latter are led by Geneva. Though\r\nsubject to the Napoleonic code, Geneva has never known that\r\ndebasing law of the tutelage of women which existed for so long a\r\ntime in the other cantons, even in the intelligent canton of Vaud,\r\nwhere it was abolished only in 1873. It was not until 1881 that a\r\nfederal statute put an end to the law throughout all Switzerland.\r\nGeneva has always been very liberal in its treatment of married\r\nwomen--divorce exists, excellent intermediate girls' schools were\r\ncreated more than thirty years ago, and women are admitted to all\r\nthe university lectures. Marie Goegg, the untiring leader of the\r\nmovement in that country, writes me:\r\n\r\n     However, notwithstanding these examples of liberality, which\r\n     denote that the law-makers had a breadth of view in accord with\r\n     their time, Switzerland, as a whole, has been one of the least\r\n     disposed of European States to accept the idea of the civil\r\n     emancipation of woman, much less her political emancipation, so\r\n     that from 1848 to 1868 the demands of American women were\r\n     considered here to be the height of extravagance.... The seed\r\n     planted in America in 1848, though its growth was difficult,\r\n     finally began to take root in Europe. The hour had come.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1868, Marie Goegg published a letter, in which she\r\ninvited the women of all nations to join with her in the formation\r\nof a society. In July of that same year the Woman's International\r\nAssociation was founded at Geneva with Marie Goegg as president.\r\nThe organization began immediately an active work, and through its\r\nefforts, several of the reforms already mentioned were brought\r\nabout, and public opinion in Switzerland considerably enlightened\r\non the question. Mrs. Goegg says:\r\n\r\n     With the object of advancing the young movement, I established at\r\n     my own risk a bi-monthly, the _Woman's Journal_ (_Journal des\r\n     femmes_). But this was a violation of that good Latin motto,\r\n     _festina lente_, and, at the end of a few months the paper\r\n     suspended publication. Swiss public opinion was not yet ready to\r\n     support such a venture.\r\n\r\n     It may be pointed out here that, except in England, all the\r\n     women's societies created in Europe had, up to the time of the\r\n     organization of the International Association refrained from\r\n     touching the question of the political rights of women. The Swiss\r\n     association, on the contrary, always included this subject in its\r\n     programme. But, unfortunately, at the moment when our efforts\r\n     were meeting with success, and the future was full of promise for\r\n     the cause which we advocated, the terrible Franco-German war\r\n     broke out, and, for various reasons unnecessary to go into here,\r\n     I felt constrained to resign the presidency, and the association\r\n     came to an end.\r\n\r\nTwo years later the International Association was revived in the\r\nform of the Solidarity (_Solidarite_), whose name signified the\r\nspirit which ought to unite all women. In 1875 Mrs. Goegg became\r\npresident of the new organization as well as founder and editor of\r\nits organ, the _Solidarity Bulletin_ (_Bulletin de la Solidarite_).\r\nBut on September 20, 1880, both society and journal ceased to\r\nexist. The president in her farewell address said:\r\n\r\n     The dissolution of the Solidarity ought not to discourage us, but\r\n     ought rather to cause us to rejoice, for the recent creation of\r\n     so many women's national societies in different countries proves\r\n     that the Solidarity has accomplished its aim, so that we have\r\n     only to retire.\r\n\r\nThe striking success of university coeducation in Switzerland calls\r\nfor a few words of notice. Mrs. Goegg writes:\r\n\r\n     In October, 1872, I sent a petition to the grand-council of\r\n     Geneva, asking that women be admitted to the university of Geneva\r\n     on the same footing as men. The state of public opinion on this\r\n     subject in Switzerland, and especially in Geneva, may be judged\r\n     from the fact that, fearing to compromise the demand if I acted\r\n     in my own name or that of the Solidarity, the petition was\r\n     presented as coming from \"the mothers of Geneva.\" Our prayer was\r\n     granted.\r\n\r\nThe number of women who have pursued studies at Geneva has steadily\r\nincreased every year. In 1878 the university of Neufchatel was\r\nthrown open to women, while the university of Zurich has long had a\r\nlarge number of female students. Professor Pflueger, of the\r\nuniversity of Bern, writing to me in April, 1883, said:\r\n\r\n     From February 2, 1876, to the present time, thirty-five women\r\n     have taken degrees at our medical school. The lectures are\r\n     attended each semester on an average by from twenty-five to\r\n     thirty women, while from three to six follow the lectures on\r\n     philosophy and letters. The presence of women at our university\r\n     has occasioned no serious inconvenience and many colleagues favor\r\n     it.\r\n\r\nThe rector of the university of Geneva wrote, February, 1883:\r\n\r\n     Up to the present time the attendance of women at our university\r\n     has occasioned us no inconvenience except in some lectures of the\r\n     medical school, where the subjects are not always of a nature to\r\n     admit of their treatment before mixed classes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe shall now glance at the situation of woman in the three\r\nScandinavian countries, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Sweden stands\r\nfirst, just as Germany does among the Teutonic nations, and France\r\namong the Latin nations; in fact we may perhaps go farther and say\r\nthat of all Continental States, Sweden leads in many respects at\r\nleast, in the revolution in favor of women.\r\n\r\nThe State, the royal family, private individuals, and, above all,\r\nwomen themselves have all striven to outstrip each other in the\r\nemancipation of Swedish women. Normal schools, high schools,\r\nprimary schools, the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal Academy\r\nof Fine Arts, both at Stockholm, dairy schools and a host of other\r\neducational institutions, both private and public, are thrown wide\r\nopen to women. The State has founded scholarships for women at\r\nUpsala University and at the medical school of the university of\r\nLund. Numerous benevolent, charitable and industrial societies\r\nhave been established and in many instances are managed by women.\r\nBut the best idea may be gained of the liberal spirit which\r\nprevails in Sweden by showing what the State has done for the\r\nemancipation of women. For instance, in 1845, equality of\r\ninheritance for son and daughter was established, and the wife was\r\ngiven equal rights with the husband as regards the common property;\r\nin 1846, woman was permitted to practice industrial professions and\r\nto carry on business in her own name; in 1861, the professions of\r\nsurgery and dentistry were opened to her; in 1864, her rights in\r\ntrade and industrial pursuits were enlarged; in 1870, she was\r\nadmitted to the universities and medical profession; in 1872, a\r\nwoman of twenty-five was given the full right of disposing of\r\nherself in marriage, the consent of parents and relations having\r\nbeen necessary before that time; and in 1874, a married woman\r\nbecame entitled to control that part of her private property set\r\naside for her personal use in the marriage contract, as well as to\r\npossess her own earnings. The reforms in favor of married women are\r\nin no small measure due to the society founded in 1871 by Mrs.\r\nE. Anckarsvaerd and Anna Hierta Retzius, whose aim was the\r\naccomplishment of these very reforms.\r\n\r\nA good beginning has been made toward securing full political\r\nrights for Swedish women. In many matters relative to the\r\nmunicipality, women vote on the same terms with men, as for\r\nexample, in the choice of the parish clergy, in the election of\r\nmunicipal councilors, and members of the county council. This\r\nlatter body elects the House of Lords, so that woman's influence,\r\nthrough an intermediate electoral body, is felt in the upper\r\nchamber. May this not be one reason why the Swedish legislature has\r\nbeen so liberal toward women? Demands have been made, but in vain,\r\nfor the complete franchise which would confer upon women the\r\nprivilege of voting for members of the diet. Woman's interests have\r\nfound a warm and energetic advocate in the _Home Review_\r\n(_Tidskrift foer Hemmet_), which was founded in 1859 by the Hon.\r\nRosalie d'Olivecrona and the Baroness Leyonhufoud, to-day the Hon.\r\nMrs. Adlersparre. The paper is still edited by the latter; Rosalie\r\nd'Olivecrona, who has always been a most active friend of the woman\r\nmovement, having retired in 1868.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we cross the boundaries of Sweden into the sister kingdom of\r\nNorway, we find the condition of woman absolutely changed.\r\n\"Concerning Norway, I have said almost nothing,\" writes Camilla\r\nCollett, the distinguished Norwegian author, in some notes which\r\nshe sent me recently on the situation of women in Scandinavia, \"for\r\nthe very simple reason that there is little to say.\" The long and\r\noppressive domination of Denmark prostrated Norway, but her close\r\nunion with Sweden since the fall of Napoleon, has begun to have a\r\ngood effect, and the liberal influence of the latter country in\r\nfavor of woman is already beginning to be felt in the other half of\r\nthe Scandinavian peninsula. One step in advance has been the\r\nopening of the university to women--\"The best thing that can be\r\nsaid of Norway,\" says Camilla Collett. Miss Cecilie Thoresen, the\r\nfirst female student to matriculate at Christiania University,\r\nwriting to me from Eidsvold, Norway, in December, 1882, says it was\r\nin 1880 that she decided to try and take an academic degree. Her\r\nfather, therefore, applied to the minister of public instruction\r\nfor the necessary authorization; the latter referred the\r\napplication to the university authorities, who, in their turn,\r\nsubmitted the portentous question to the faculty of the law-school.\r\nIn due season Miss Thoresen received this rather unsatisfactory\r\nresponse:\r\n\r\n     The admission of women to the university is denied, but we\r\n     recognize the necessity for changing the law on the subject.\r\n\r\nThereupon Mr. H. E. Berner, the prominent liberal member of the\r\nStorthing, or Norwegian parliament, introduced a bill permitting\r\nwomen to pursue university studies leading to the degrees in arts\r\nand philosophy (_examen artium_ and _examen philosophicum_). The\r\ncommittee reported unanimously in favor of the bill; on March 30,\r\n1882, it passed without debate the Odelsthing, one of the two\r\nchambers of the Storthing, with but one dissenting voice--that of a\r\nclergyman; on April 21, 1882, it received the unanimous vote of the\r\nother house, the Lagthing; and it finally became a law on June 15,\r\n1882. But Mr. Berner did not stop here. He once wrote me:\r\n\r\n     In my opinion there hardly exists nowadays another social problem\r\n     which has a better claim on public attention than that of the\r\n     emancipation of women. Until they are placed on an equal footing\r\n     with men, we shall not have departed from the days of barbarism.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, Mr. Berner succeeded in making it possible for women to\r\ntake all university degrees, the law of 1882 having opened to them\r\nonly the degrees in arts and philosophy. He is now pressing on the\r\nattention of parliament other reforms in favor of women; and he has\r\nrecently written me that he believes that his efforts will be\r\ncrowned with success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Denmark nothing has been done in the direction of political\r\nrights, nothing for school suffrage, though the liberal movement of\r\n1848 improved woman's legal position slightly. But the situation of\r\nmarried women is still very unsatisfactory, for it may be summed up\r\nby saying that her property and her children are controlled by the\r\nhusband. In 1879 many thousand women petitioned the legislature for\r\nthe right to their own earnings, and a law was passed to this\r\neffect. During the last twenty years, thanks to the example set by\r\nSweden, much has been done to open to women the field of work. In\r\n1875 the university consented to receive women, but as the State\r\nfurnishes them only primary instruction, and does nothing for their\r\nintermediate instruction, leaving this broad gap to be filled by\r\nprivate efforts, the educational situation of Danish women leaves\r\nmuch to be desired. But the women themselves have turned their\r\nattention to this matter, and high schools and professional schools\r\nfor women, and generally managed by women, are springing up.\r\n\r\nDenmark has produced several journals devoted to the interests of\r\nwomen and edited by women. The _Friday_ (_Fredagen_), issued from\r\nJuly, 1875, to 1879, was edited by Vilhelmine Zahle. It was a bold,\r\nradical little sheet. The name was probably taken from the _Woman's\r\nJournal and Friday Society_, which appeared at Copenhagen in 1767,\r\nunder the anonymous editorship of a woman. The _Woman's Review_\r\n(_Tidsskrift for Kvinder_) began to appear in January, 1882. Its\r\neditor, Elfride Fibiger, has associated with her Mr. Friis, a very\r\nearnest friend of the women's movement, who has given a more\r\nprogressive turn to the paper, which has come out for women's\r\nsuffrage--the first journal in Denmark to take this radical step.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most encouraging sign of progress is the foundation,\r\nduring the past few years, of numerous associations of women with\r\ndifferent objects in view. John Stuart Mill's \"Subjection of\r\nWomen,\" which was translated into Danish and widely read; the\r\n\"Letters from Clara Raphael,\" of Mathilde Fibiger, which appeared\r\nstill earlier, in 1850; the writings of Camilla Collett, of Norway;\r\nthe liberal utterances of the great poets of the North, Bjoernsen,\r\nHostrup and Ibsen, whose \"Nora\" has rightfully procured for him\r\nthe title of \"Woman's Poet\"; the great progress in America, England\r\nand Sweden; all these influences stimulated thought, weakened\r\nprejudices and prepared the way for reforms in the Danish\r\npeninsula. Kirstine Frederiksen, of Copenhagen, says:\r\n\r\n     It is plainly evident that Danish women are weary of the part\r\n     allotted to them in the old society, a part characterized by the\r\n     sentiment that the best that can be said of a woman is that there\r\n     is nothing to say about her.... When, in due time, the claim for\r\n     political rights is made here in Denmark, then will women from\r\n     all classes unite in their efforts to secure the palladium which\r\n     alone can protect them from arbitrariness and subjection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe shall now take up the Slavonic countries, beginning with Russia,\r\nwhich stands first, not only because of its vastness, but also\r\nbecause of its liberality toward women. The position of the Russian\r\nwomen before the law is very peculiar. Children, whatever their age\r\nand whether male or female, are never emancipated from the control\r\nof their parents. The daughter can only escape from this authority,\r\nand then only in a limited degree, by marriage, and the son by\r\nentering the service of the State. In the provinces alone girls of\r\ntwenty-one may marry without the parents' consent. The married\r\nwoman is in the full power of her husband, though she is the\r\nmistress of her own fortune. Divorce exists. Russian women vote on\r\nan equality with men for members of the municipal councils and\r\ncounty assemblies, and these two bodies choose the boards which\r\ntransact the public business, such as superintending the collection\r\nof taxes, keeping the roads in order, directing the schools, etc.\r\nThe Russian woman does, not however, appear at the polls, but is\r\nrepresented by some male relative or friend (as we have already\r\nseen in Austria) who casts the vote for her. Thus the Russian\r\nwoman, except that she is ineligible to office, possesses all the\r\npolitical rights of the Russian man--a privilege, however, that is\r\nof little value in a country where liberty is crushed under the\r\niron heel of autocracy. The position of the Russian peasant women\r\nis not as good as that of the women of the upper classes. They find\r\nsome comfort, however, in the doctrines of the rapidly spreading\r\nreligious sects, which resemble somewhat the American Revivalists\r\nor Anabaptists. In fact, the subject condition of Russian women is\r\none of the chief causes of the growth of these sects; down-trodden\r\nby society and the State, they seek liberty in religion. In some of\r\nthese sects women preach. Miss Maria Zebrikoff, an able Russian\r\nwriter, sends me this curious information:\r\n\r\n     We have lately heard of a new sect which preaches a doctrine\r\n     exalting woman. She is placed above man, because she can give\r\n     birth to another being. Her pain and travail are so great, that\r\n     alleviating the other sufferings and annoyances of woman would be\r\n     but a poor reward; she is entitled to the deepest gratitude of\r\n     mankind.\r\n\r\nThought concerning the emancipation of woman was first awakened\r\namong the upper classes about 1840, inspired by George Sand, but\r\nwas confined to a narrow circle of men of science and authors. The\r\nnew ideas continued to exist in a latent form until the freedom of\r\nthe serfs in 1860, when they burst forth into life. The reforms of\r\nthe last reign, the abolishment of bureaucratic government and the\r\nemancipation of the slaves, advanced the cause of woman, for the\r\ndaughters of the office-holders and land-owners, reduced to poverty\r\nby these changes, were forced to go forth into the world and earn\r\ntheir own living. Woman's success in the walks of higher\r\neducation--especially in medicine--has been a great victory for the\r\nfriends of the rights of woman. The government, the professors of\r\nthe university and women themselves have all united, more or less\r\nheartily, in a common effort to give Russian women facilities for a\r\ncomplete education. The first woman's medical school in Russia owes\r\nits origin to a donation of 50,000 rubles from a woman. The war\r\ndepartment--for Russia thinks of medicine only in its relation to\r\nthe army--came to the aid of the new movement, and the medical\r\nprofession, though in a restricted manner, was thrown open to\r\nwomen.[574] As yet women physicians may treat only diseases of\r\nwomen and children, but, notwithstanding this drawback, there are\r\nfifty-two women physicians in St. Petersburg and two hundred and\r\nfifty in Russia. During the last war with Turkey twenty women\r\nphysicians did noble work in the army. Women flock to the\r\nuniversities in great numbers. An attempt has been made to render\r\nthe profession of law accessible to them, but the government has\r\nprohibited it. It is expected that ere long women will be\r\nprofessors in the university. The chemical, medical and legal\r\nassociations have already received women into membership.\r\n\r\nIn literature Russian women take an active part; reviews,\r\nmagazines, and political journals counting many women among their\r\ncontributors and in some cases their directors. Writes Maria\r\nZebrikoff:\r\n\r\n     It is especially in the domain of fiction that Russian women\r\n     excel. After the two renowned names of Tourgueneff and Tolstoi,\r\n     the greatest genius of which our contemporary literature can\r\n     boast is Krestowsky, the pseudonym of woman.\r\n\r\n\"The reaectionary party,\" exclaims the same lady with enthusiasm,\r\n\"counts in its ranks no woman distinguished for thought or talent.\"\r\nEven this brief glance at woman's position in Russia conclusively\r\nproves that when the day of liberty comes to the great Cossack\r\nempire, the women will be as thoroughly fitted to enter upon all\r\nthe duties of citizenship as the men. The women of no other\r\ncontinental nation are perhaps better prepared for complete\r\nemancipation than those of Russia. Here, as in several other\r\nrespects, autocratic Russia resembles free America. The good-will\r\nof every transatlantic friend of woman's elevation should ever go\r\nforth to this brave, struggling people of the North.\r\n\r\nThe civil law of the kingdom of Poland, a part of Russia, has been,\r\nsince 1809, the Napoleonic code; the other Polish provinces of\r\nRussia are subject to Russian law. Under the former, the woman has\r\nan equal share in the patrimony; but the married woman is a\r\nperpetual minor. According to the Russian code, on the contrary, a\r\ngirl receives only a fourteenth part of the patrimony; and when a\r\ndistant relative dies, brothers alone inherit. But a woman has\r\nabsolute control of her own property: and when she becomes of age,\r\nat twenty-one, she may buy, own, sell, without being subjected to\r\nany tutelage, without requiring the consent of the husband--the\r\nvery contrary of the Napoleonic code. This same thing is true in\r\nseveral other particulars, a striking illustration of the fact that\r\nmuch-abused Russian civilization is in some respects superior to\r\nthe much-vaunted Latin civilization. In regard to education, the\r\nPolish woman is not so well off. In the primary schools alone does\r\nshe enjoy equal rights; in secondary education she has far fewer\r\nadvantages than the boy; while as for university instruction, she\r\nis forced to seek it in Russia or in foreign lands, the Polish\r\nuniversities being absolutely closed against her. In the Polish\r\nprovinces under direct Russian authority, the State does nothing\r\nwhatever for woman's instruction; and in the kingdom of Poland, the\r\nsame thing is true except in the matter of primary instruction.\r\nPolish women may practice medicine, if, besides this foreign\r\ndiploma, they also pass an examination before the medical school of\r\nSt. Petersburg. Tomaszewicz Dobrska is one of the few Polish women\r\nwho has succeeded in this difficult field.\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Fine Arts at Cracow is open to men alone, but\r\nMadeline Andrzejkowicz has endeavored to fill the gap by\r\nestablishing at Warsaw a school of painting for women. The first\r\nwoman's industrial school was founded in 1874 at Warsaw, and during\r\nthe first six years, to 1880, it had 743 scholars. Establishments\r\nof this kind are now quite numerous in the kingdom, but, for\r\npolitical reasons, they have not been founded in the Polish\r\nprovinces of Russia. The unfortunate political situation of Poland,\r\nwhich robs even men of their rights, is an insurmountable obstacle\r\nin the way of the emancipation of women. There are, however, many\r\nencouraging signs of progress. At Warsaw there is more than one\r\nnewspaper edited by a woman. Marie Ilnicka has owned and edited for\r\nmore than sixteen years, at the capital, a paper which is widely\r\nread and which has great influence. It is no uncommon thing for\r\nwomen to deliver public lectures, which are very popular and draw\r\nlarge houses. Elise Orzeszko, the distinguished Polish novelist,\r\ntells me:\r\n\r\n     We have confidence in the efforts of the men who are leading\r\n     society and who are sacrificing their talents and earnestly\r\n     toiling to advance liberal ideas. In the meanwhile our duty is to\r\n     awaken thought on the question of woman's rights, so that when a\r\n     better day does come to Poland, women may be ready to participate\r\n     in the common welfare.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut we cannot close this brief sketch without mentioning the\r\nOrient, that region of transition between the darkness of Asia and\r\nthe light of occidental Europe; for, though the position of woman\r\nis in general so lamentable that at first glance it seems best to\r\npass over this portion of the continent in silence, one catches\r\nhere and there a glimmer of progress that portends a better day in\r\nthe still distant future. And, too, regenerate Greece commands our\r\nattention, for she indeed is a rich oasis in this desert of\r\nMohammedan conquest.\r\n\r\nThere are many Ottoman women, especially among the rich families,\r\nwho desire to change their dress and enter into relations with the\r\nwomen of other religions, but the ecclesiastical and civil\r\nauthorities are always ready to check this tendency and to\r\nrigorously enforce the ancient customs. In certain harems earnest\r\nefforts have been made to establish true family life and to bring\r\nup the children under the eye and care of the parents, with the aid\r\nof foreign governesses, who, along with the languages, inculcate\r\nthe habits and manners of occidental nations. Vain attempts have\r\nbeen made to found girls' schools. There are noble natures who long\r\nfor amelioration of their state, and for progress, but fanaticism\r\ncondemns everything to mortal stagnation.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish woman leads a contracted, monotonous existence under the\r\nauthority of the priest. The wives of many rich bankers have tried\r\nto do something to improve the condition of Hebrew women by\r\nfounding aid societies, primary schools, and normal schools. The\r\nBulgarian women of the country enjoy an agricultural and pastoral\r\nlife, and those of the city are simple and primitive in their\r\nhabits and customs. But little has been done for woman's\r\ninstruction, though some worthy attempts have been made to\r\nestablish schools. The hope of the regeneration of the Oriental\r\nwoman lies in the influence of Greek civilization. The emancipation\r\nof the Greek woman means the emancipation of the Turkish woman.\r\n\r\nThe Greek woman in the Orient must be studied under two heads: the\r\nGreek woman in Turkey and the Greek woman in Greece. In\r\nboth cases we find them filled with the spirit of western\r\ncivilization--perhaps it would be better to say, with the spirit of\r\ntheir classic ancestors. Primary, secondary and normal schools,\r\nasylums, hospitals, societies--all for women and generally managed\r\nby women--are found in all the Greek centers of Turkey. Calliope A.\r\nKechayia, the cultured principal of the Zappion, the famous girls'\r\ncollege at Constantinople, says:\r\n\r\n     The intellectual condition of the Greek woman in the Orient is,\r\n     generally speaking, not inferior to that of women in many parts\r\n     of Europe; and as regards the instruction of the girls of the\r\n     lower classes, it is much superior to that of several Latin\r\n     countries.\r\n\r\nThe Greek woman in Greece differs essentially from the Oriental\r\nwoman. With the independence of Greece came a great patriotic\r\nmovement for the building up of the new nationality, a movement in\r\nwhich women took a most active and prominent part. Several American\r\nwomen, especially Mrs. Hill, lent their aid and founded the first\r\ngirls' school at Athens. \"A whole generation of women,\" says a\r\nGreek lady, \"distinguished for their social and family virtues,\r\nreceived their education in this college.\" An association of\r\nGreeks soon afterward established a normal school for women. The\r\nGreek government also early took up the question of popular\r\neducation without excluding women from its plans. The way in which\r\nyoung Greek schoolmistresses hastened all over the peninsula,\r\nspreading knowledge, the Greek language and their own enthusiasm\r\nthroughout the newly liberated nation, is one of the most unique\r\nepisodes in modern history. \"It is true and beyond dispute,\" I am\r\ntold by Miss Kechayia, \"that the Greece of to-day owes its rapid\r\nprogress and its Greek instruction to its women.\" But the Greek\r\nwoman is more than a school-mistress. The wife of a public man has\r\nother than social duties to occupy her. She often represents her\r\nhusband before his constituents. She participates actively and\r\nusefully in many of his political affairs. It frequently happens\r\nthat the wife goes into the provinces to solicit votes for her\r\nhusband, and sometimes in drawing-room lectures she defends his\r\npolitical conduct. \"In truth these facts would not be believed by a\r\nforeigner if he had not seen them with his own eyes,\" I was once\r\ntold by a Greek. Associations of various kinds have been formed by\r\nwomen during the past few years, and there is at least one instance\r\nof a woman lecturing in public on literary topics. However, woman's\r\nrights in the American sense has not yet penetrated into Greece,\r\nbut from what has just been said it will be seen that when that day\r\ncomes, the reform will find a soil well prepared for its reception.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief and general view of the present status of the Woman\r\nQuestion on the European Continent. It will have been constantly\r\nnoticed in the preceding pages that in every country there are\r\nevidences of progress. Public opinion in the Old World is slowly\r\nbut surely accepting Voltaire's statement when the broad-minded\r\nphilosopher says, with a dash of French gallantry: \"Women are\r\ncapable of doing everything we do, with this single difference\r\nbetween them and us, that they are more amiable than we are.\" In\r\nmatters of instruction, the ideas of Montesquieu and Aime Martin\r\nare gaining ground. \"The powers of the sexes,\" wrote the\r\npenetrating author of the \"Spirit of the Laws,\" \"would be equal if\r\ntheir education were, too. Test women in the talents that have not\r\nbeen enfeebled by the way they have been educated, and we will then\r\nsee if we are so strong.\" \"It is in spite of our stupid system of\r\neducation,\" declared Aime Martin, more than fifty years ago, \"that\r\nwomen have an idea, a mind and a soul.\" And even the more radical\r\nutterances of the late Eugene Pelletan find an echo. \"By keeping\r\nwomen outside of politics,\" once said the distinguished senator,\r\n\"the soul of our country is diminished by one-half.\" No wonder then\r\nthat Frances Power Cobbe likens this revolution to the irresistible\r\nwaves of the ocean. \"Of all the movements, political, social and\r\nreligious, of past ages, there is, I think,\" writes Miss Cobbe,\r\n\"not one so unmistakably tide-like in its extension and the\r\nuniformity of its impulse, as that which has taken place within\r\nliving memory among the women of almost every race on the globe.\r\nOther agitations, reforms and revolutions have pervaded and lifted\r\nup classes, tribes, nations, churches. But this movement has\r\nstirred an entire sex, even half the human race. * * * When the\r\ntime comes to look back on the slow, universal awakening of women\r\nall over the globe, on their gradual entrance into one privileged\r\nprofession after another, on the attainment by them of rights of\r\nperson and property, and, at last, on their admission to the full\r\nprivileges of citizenship, it will be acknowledged that of all the\r\n'Decisive Battles of History,' this has been, to the moralist and\r\nphilosopher, the most interesting; even as it will be (I cannot\r\ndoubt) the one followed by the happiest Peace which the world has\r\never seen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[566] This chapter is, in large part, a resume of Mr. Stanton's\r\nvaluable work \"The Woman Question in Europe,\" published in 1884 by\r\nthe Putnams of New York, to which we refer the reader who desires\r\nto study more in detail the European movement for women.--[THE\r\nEDITORS.\r\n\r\n[567] The United States was represented by Albert Brisbane and Mrs.\r\nBrisbane, of New York; Elizabeth Chalmers and Mrs. Gibbons, of\r\nPhiladelphia; Colonel T. W. Higginson, of Massachusetts; Miss\r\nHotchkiss, Fernando Jones and his wife and daughter, Jane Graham\r\nJones and Genevieve Graham Jones (now Mrs. Geo. R. Grant), Mrs.\r\nKlumpke and her two daughters, of Chicago; Mrs. Party and Louisa\r\nSouthworth, of Ohio.\r\n\r\n[568] Before closing this brief sketch, I desire to mention with\r\ndeep gratitude the name of the man who first lifted up his voice in\r\nthe Italian parliament to defend and protect women. Salvatore\r\nMorelli deserves the veneration of every Italian woman. His first\r\nbook, \"Woman and Science\" (_La Donna e la Scienza_), dedicated to\r\nAntona Traversi, was animated by a just and noble spirit, too\r\nradical, however, to meet with universal approbation. When he\r\nentered parliament, Morelli, with the same courage, constancy, and\r\nradicalism, demanded the complete emancipation of women.\r\nConservatives laughed, and many friends of our movement trembled\r\nfor the cause. Ably seconded by Mancini, he succeeded in securing\r\nfor women the right to testify in civil actions, a dignity which\r\nthey had not previously enjoyed, although, by an absurd\r\ncontradiction they could be witnesses in criminal cases, convict of\r\nmurder by a single word and send the criminal to the scaffold. One\r\nof Morelli's last acts was a divorce bill which was examined by the\r\nChamber. Guardasigilli Tomman Villa, the then Minister of Justice,\r\nwas inclined to accept it, but death, which occurred in 1880, saved\r\npoor Morelli the pain of seeing his proposition rejected. An appeal\r\nto women has been made to raise a modest monument to Salvatore\r\nMorelli in memory of his good deeds, by Aurelia Cimino Folliero de\r\nLuna.

The result will probably be the\r\nfoundation of medical colleges for women independent of government\r\naid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCES.\r\n\r\nBY E. C. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nReaching London amidst the fogs and mists of November, 1882, the\r\nfirst person I met, after a separation of many years, was our\r\nrevered and beloved friend, William Henry Channing. The tall,\r\ngraceful form was somewhat bent; the sweet, thoughtful face\r\nsomewhat sadder; the crimes and miseries of the world seemed more\r\nheavy on his heart than ever. With his refined, nervous\r\norganization, the gloomy moral and physical atmosphere of London\r\nwas the last place on earth where that beautiful life should have\r\nended. I found him in earnest conversation with my daughter and a\r\nyoung Englishman soon to be married, advising them not only as to\r\nthe importance of the step they were about to take, but as to the\r\nminor points to be observed in the ceremony. At the appointed time\r\na few friends gathered in Portland-street chapel, and as we\r\napproached the altar, our friend appeared in surplice and gown, his\r\npale, spiritual face more tender and beautiful than ever. This was\r\nthe last marriage service he ever performed, and it was as pathetic\r\nas original, his whole appearance so in harmony with the exquisite\r\nsentiments he uttered that we who listened felt as if for the time\r\nbeing we had entered with him into the Holy of Holies.\r\n\r\nSome time after, Miss Anthony and I called on him, to return our\r\nthanks for the very complimentary review he had written of the\r\nHistory of Woman Suffrage. He thanked us in turn for the many\r\npleasant memories we had revived in those pages, which he said had\r\nbeen as entertaining as a novel; \"but,\" said he, \"they have filled\r\nme with indignation, too, over the repeated insults offered to\r\nwomen so earnestly engaged in honest endeavors for the uplifting of\r\nmankind. I blushed for my sex more than once in reading these\r\nvolumes.\" We lingered long in talking over the events connected\r\nwith this great struggle for freedom. He dwelt with tenderness on\r\nour divisions and disappointments, and entered more fully into the\r\nhumiliations suffered by women than any man we ever met. His\r\nconversation that day was fully as appreciative of the nice points\r\nin the degradation of sex as is John Stuart Mill in his wonderful\r\nwork on \"The Subjection of Woman.\" He was intensely interested in\r\nFrances Power Cobbe's efforts to suppress the vivisectionists, and\r\nthe last time I saw him he was presiding at a parlor meeting at\r\nMrs. Wolcott Brown's, when Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell gave an\r\nadmirable address on the causes and cure of the social evil. Mr.\r\nChanning spoke beautifully in closing, paying a warm and merited\r\ncompliment to Miss Blackwell's clear and concise review of all the\r\ndifficulties involved in the question.\r\n\r\nReading so much of English reformers in our journals, of the\r\nBrights, the McLarens, the Taylors, of Lydia Becker, Caroline\r\nBiggs, Josephine Butler and Octavia Hill, and of their great\r\ndemonstrations with lords and members of parliament in the chair,\r\nwe had longed to compare the actors in those scenes with our\r\nspeakers and conventions on this side the water. At last we met\r\nthem, one and all, in London, York, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow,\r\nEdinburgh, in great public meetings and parlor reunions, at dinners\r\nand receptions, listened to their public men in parliament, the\r\ncourts and the pulpit, to the women in their various assemblies,\r\nand came to the conclusion that Americans surpass them in oratory\r\nand the spirited manner in which they conduct meetings. They have\r\nno system of elocution in England such as we have--a thorough\r\ntraining of the voice, in what is called vocal gymnastics. A\r\nhesitating, apologetic way seems to be the national idea for an\r\nexordium on all questions. Even their ablest men who have visited\r\nthis country, such as Kingsley, Stanley, Arnold, Spencer, Tyndal,\r\nHuxley, and Canon Farrar, have all been criticised by the American\r\npublic for their stammering enunciation. They have no speakers to\r\ncompare with Wendell Phillips and George William Curtis, or Anna\r\nDickinson and Phoebe W. Couzins. John Bright is without a peer\r\namong his countrymen, as are Mrs. Bessant and Miss Helen Taylor\r\namong the women. Miss Tod, from Belfast, is a good speaker. The\r\nwomen, as a general thing, are more fluent than the men; those of\r\nthe Bright family in all its branches have deep, rich voices.\r\n\r\nAmong the young women, Mrs. Fawcett, Mrs. Charles McLaren, Mrs.\r\nScatcherd, Miss Henrietta Mueller, Mrs. Fenwick Miller, and Lady\r\nHarberton, all speak with comparative ease and self-possession. The\r\nlatter is striving to introduce for her countrywomen a new style of\r\ndress, in which all the garments are bifurcated, but so skillfully\r\nadjusted in generous plaits and folds, that while the wearer enjoys\r\nthe utmost freedom, the casual observer is quite ignorant of the\r\ninnovation. We attended one of their public meetings for the\r\ndiscussion of that question, at which Miss King, Mrs. Charles\r\nMcLaren, and Lady Harberton appeared in the new costume. All spoke\r\nin its defense, and were very witty and amusing in criticising the\r\npresent feminine forms and fashions. Lady Harberton gave us a\r\ndelightful entertainment one evening at her fine residence on\r\nCromwell Road, where we laughed enough to dissipate the depressing\r\neffect of the fogs for a week to come over the recitations of\r\nCorney Green on the piano. There, among many other celebrities, we\r\nmet Moncure D. Conway[575] and his charming wife.\r\n\r\nI reached England in time to attend the great demonstration in\r\nGlasgow to celebrate the extension of the municipal franchise to\r\nthe women of Scotland. It was a remarkable occasion. St. Andrew's\r\nimmense hall was packed with women; a few men were admitted to the\r\ngallery at half a crown apiece. It was said there were 5,000 people\r\npresent. When a Scotch audience is thoroughly roused, nothing can\r\nequal the enthusiasm. The arriving of the speakers on the platform\r\nwas announced with the wildest applause, the entire audience\r\nrising, waving their handkerchiefs, and clapping their hands, and\r\nevery compliment paid the people was received with similar\r\noutbursts of pleasure. Mrs. McLaren, a sister of John Bright,[576]\r\npresided, and made the opening speech. I had the honor, on this\r\noccasion, of addressing an audience for the first time in the old\r\nworld. Many others spoke briefly. There were too many speakers; no\r\none had time to warm up to the point of eloquence. Our system of\r\nconventions of two or three days, with long speeches discussing\r\npointed and radical resolutions, is quite unknown in England. Their\r\nmeetings consist of one session of a few hours into which they\r\ncrowd all the speakers they can summon together. They have a few\r\ntame resolutions on which there can be no possible difference of\r\nopinion printed, with the names of those who are to speak appended.\r\nEach of these is read, a few short speeches made, that may or may\r\nnot have the slightest reference to the resolution, which is then\r\npassed. The last is usually one of thanks to some lord or member of\r\nparliament who may have condescended to preside at the meeting, or\r\nto do something for the measure in parliament; it is spoken to like\r\nall that have gone before. The Queen is referred to tenderly in\r\nmost of the speeches, although she has never done anything to merit\r\nthe approbation of the advocates of suffrage for woman. As on this\r\noccasion a woman conducted the meeting, much of the usual red tape\r\nwas omitted.\r\n\r\nFrom Glasgow quite a large party of the Brights and McLarens went\r\nto Edinburgh, where the Hon. Duncan McLaren gave us a warm welcome\r\nto Newington House, under the very shadow of the Salisbury crags.\r\nThese and the Pentland Hills are the remarkable feature in the\r\nlandscape as you approach this beautiful city, with its monuments\r\nand castles on which are written the history of the centuries. We\r\npassed a few charming days driving about, visiting old friends, and\r\ndiscussing the status of woman on both sides of the Atlantic. Here\r\nwe met Elizabeth Pease Nichol, Jane and Eliza Wigham, whom I had\r\nnot seen since we sat together in the World's Anti-slavery\r\nConvention in London in 1840, Yet I knew Mrs. Nichol at once; her\r\nstrongly-marked face is one not readily forgotten.\r\n\r\nI went with the family on Sunday to Friends' meeting, where a most\r\nunusual manifestation for that decorous sect occurred. I had been\r\ntold that if I felt inclined, it would be considered quite proper\r\nfor me to make some remarks, and just as I was revolving an opening\r\nsentence to a few thoughts I desired to present, a man arose in a\r\nremote part of the house, and began in a low voice to give his\r\ntestimony as to the truth that was in him. All eyes were turned\r\ntoward him, when suddenly a friend leaned over the back of the\r\nseat, seized his coat-tails and jerked him down in a most emphatic\r\nmanner. The poor man buried his face in his hands, and maintained a\r\nprofound silence. I learned afterwards that he was a bore, and the\r\nfriend in the rear thought it wise to nip him in the bud. This\r\nscene put to flight all intentions of speaking on my part, lest I,\r\ntoo, might get outside the prescribed limits, and be suppressed by\r\nforce. I dined with Mrs. Nichol at Huntly Lodge, where she has\r\nentertained in turn many of our American reformers. Her walls have\r\nechoed to the voices of Garrison, Rogers, Samuel J. May, Parker\r\nPillsbury, Henry C. Wright, Douglass and Remond, and hosts of\r\nEnglish philanthropists. Though over eighty, she is still awake on\r\nall questions of the hour, and generous in her hospitalities as of\r\nyore.\r\n\r\nLater, Miss Anthony, in company with Mrs. Rebecca Moore, spent\r\nseveral weeks in Edinburgh looking over Mrs. Nichol's voluminous\r\ncorrespondence with the anti-slavery apostles, to see if anything\r\nof interest could be gleaned for these volumes. She found Mrs.\r\nMoore as a traveling companion better than the most approved\r\nencyclopedia, as she possessed all possible information on every\r\nsubject and locality, so that all Miss Anthony had to do was to\r\nkeep her ears open whenever she was sufficiently rested to listen.\r\nThere, too, Miss Anthony visited Dr. Agnes McLaren, in her\r\n_recherche_ home, and found her as charming in the social circle as\r\nshe was said to be skillful in her profession. She spent several\r\ndays also with Dr. Jex Blake, and from her lips heard the full\r\naccount of her prolonged struggle to open the medical college to\r\nwomen, and to secure for them as students equal recognition. After\r\nlistening to all the humiliations to which they had been subjected,\r\nand their final expulsion from the university, and of the riots in\r\nEdinburgh, Miss Anthony felt that Dr. Jex Blake had fought the\r\nbattle with great wisdom and heroism. The failure of the experiment\r\nin that university was not due to a want of tact in the women who\r\nled the movement, but to the natural bigotry and obstinacy of the\r\nScotch people, the universal hostility of the medical professors to\r\nall innovations, and the antagonism men feel towards women as\r\ncompetitors in the sciences and professions. Before leaving\r\nEdinburgh a public reception was tendered to Miss Anthony, Mrs.\r\nNichol presiding. Professor Blackie, Mrs. Jessie Wellstood, and the\r\nhonored guest herself, did the speaking. With refreshments and\r\nconversation it was altogether a pleasant occasion.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I was making new friends in the other parts of the\r\nkingdom. Mrs. Margaret Lucas, whose whole soul is in the temperance\r\nmovement, escorted me from Edinburgh to Manchester, to be present\r\nat another great demonstration in the Town Hall, the finest\r\nbuilding in that district. It had just been completed, and, with\r\nits ante-rooms, dining hall, and various apartments for social\r\nentertainments, was altogether the most perfect hall I had seen in\r\nEngland. There I was entertained by Mrs. Matilda Roby, who, with\r\nher husband, gave me a most hospitable reception. She invited\r\nseveral friends to luncheon one day, among others, Miss Lydia\r\nBecker, editor of the _Suffrage Journal_ in that city, and the Rev.\r\nMr. Steinthal, who had visited this country and spoken on our\r\nplatform. The chief topic at the table was John Stuart Mill, his\r\nlife, character, writings, and his position with reference to the\r\npolitical rights of woman. In the evening we went to see Ristori in\r\nQueen Elizabeth. Having seen her many years before in America, I\r\nwas surprised to find her still so vigorous. And thus, from week to\r\nweek, were suffrage meetings, receptions, dinners, luncheons and\r\ntheatres pleasantly alternated.\r\n\r\nThe following Sunday we heard a grand sermon from Moncure D.\r\nConway, and had a pleasant interview with him and Mrs. Conway at\r\nthe close of the sessions. Later we spent a few pleasant days at\r\ntheir artistic home, filled with books, pictures, and mementoes\r\nfrom loving friends. A billiard-room with well-worn cues and balls\r\nmay in a measure account for his vigorous sermons--quite a novel\r\nadjunct to a parsonage. A garden reception there to Mr. and Mrs.\r\nHowells, gave us an opportunity to see the American novelist\r\nsurrounded by his admiring friends. Howells and Hawthorne seemed to\r\nbe great favorites in the literary circles of England at that time,\r\nbut I never read one of their novels without regretting for the\r\nhonor of American women that they had not painted more vigorous and\r\npiquant characters for their heroines.\r\n\r\nOne was always sure of meeting some Americans worth knowing at the\r\nConway's in Bedford Park. We dined there with Mary Clemmer and Mr.\r\nHudson, just after their marriage, and a bright, pretty daughter of\r\nMurat Halstead, who chatted as gaily among the staid English as on\r\nher native heath. There, too, we first saw Mrs. William Mellen with\r\nher daughters, from Colorado Springs, now residing in London for\r\nthe purpose of educating a family of seven children,[577] although\r\nthere is no so fitting place to educate children to the duties of\r\ncitizens of a republic, as under our own free institutions. If\r\npossessed of wealth, they readily adopt aristocratic ideas, and\r\nenjoy the distinctions of class they find in all monarchical\r\ncountries, which totally unfit them for properly appreciating the\r\ndemocratic principles it is our interest to cherish at home.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday after Mr. Conway left for Australia, I was invited to\r\nfill his pulpit. Spending a few days with Mrs. Conway, we attended\r\nthe Ladies' Club one afternoon. The leading spirits seemed to be\r\nMiss Orme and Miss Richardson, both attorneys in practice, with an\r\noffice in London, though not yet regularly admitted to the Queen's\r\nBench. The topic of discussion was the well-worn theme--the\r\neducation of girls; but no one seemed quite prepared to take off\r\nall the ligatures from their bodies and the fears of everything\r\nknown or unknown from their minds, and leave them for a season to\r\ngrow as nature intended, that we might find out by seeing them in\r\ntheir normal condition what their real wants and needs might be. I\r\nsuggested for their next topic, the proper education of boys, which\r\nwas accepted. I retired that night very nervous over my sermon for\r\nthe next day, and the feeling steadily increased until I reached\r\nthe platform; but once there, my fears were all dissipated, and I\r\nnever enjoyed speaking more than on that occasion, for I had been\r\nso long oppressed with the degradation of woman under canon law and\r\nchurch discipline that I had a sense of relief in pouring out my\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\nMy theme was, \"What has Christianity done for Woman?\" and by the\r\nfacts of history, I showed clearly that to no form of religion was\r\nwoman indebted for one impulse of freedom, as all alike have taught\r\nher inferiority and subjection to man. No lofty virtues can emanate\r\nfrom such a condition. Whatever heights of dignity and purity women\r\nhave individually attained, can in no way be attributed to the\r\ndogmas of their religion.\r\n\r\nWith my son Theodore, always deeply interested in my friends and\r\npublic work, we called on Mrs. Gray, Miss Jessie Boucherett and Dr.\r\nHoggan, who had written essays for \"The Woman Question in Europe\";\r\non our American minister, Mr. Lowell, Mr. and Mrs. George W.\r\nSmalley, and many other notable men and women. By appointment we\r\nhad an hour with the Hon. John Bright at his residence on\r\nPiccadilly. As his photograph, with his fame, had reached America,\r\nhis fine face and head, as well as his political opinions, were\r\nquite familiar to us. He received us with great cordiality, and\r\nmanifested a clear knowledge, and deep interest in regard to all\r\nAmerican affairs. Free trade and woman suffrage formed the basis of\r\nour conversation; the literature of our respective countries, our\r\ngreat men and women, the lighter topics of the occasion. He is not\r\nsound in regard to the political rights of women, but it is not\r\ngiven to any one man to be equally clear on all questions. He voted\r\nfor John Stuart Mill's amendment to the \"Household Suffrage Bill,\"\r\nin 1867, but, as he said, as a personal favor to a friend, without\r\nany strong convictions as to the merits of what he considered \"a\r\npurely sentimental measure.\"\r\n\r\nWe attended the meeting called to rejoice over the passage of the\r\nMarried Woman's Property bill, which gave to the women of England\r\nin 1882 what we had enjoyed in many States in this country since\r\n1848. Mrs. Jacob Bright, Mrs. Scatcherd, Mrs. Almy, and several\r\nmembers of parliament made short speeches of congratulation to\r\nthose who had been instrumental in carrying the measure. It was\r\ngenerally conceded that to the tact and persistence of Mrs. Bright,\r\nmore than to any other one person, belonged the credit of that\r\nachievement. Hon. Jacob Bright was at that time a member of\r\nparliament, and fully in sympathy with the bill; and while Mrs.\r\nBright exerted all her social influence to make it popular with the\r\nmembers, her husband, thoroughly versed in parliamentary tactics,\r\navailed himself of every technicality to push the bill through the\r\nHouse of Commons. Mrs. Bright's chief object in securing this bill,\r\naside from establishing the right every human being has to his own\r\nproperty, was, to lift married women on an even plane with widows\r\nand spinsters, thereby making them qualified voters.\r\n\r\nThe next day we went out to Barn Elms to visit Mr. and Mrs. Chas.\r\nMcLaren. Mr. McLaren, a Quaker by birth and education, has\r\nsustained to his uttermost the suffrage movement, and his charming\r\nlittle wife, the daughter of Mrs. Pochin, is worthy the noble\r\nmother who was among the earliest leaders on this question,\r\nspeaking and writing with equal ability on all phases of the\r\nsubject. Barn Elms is a grand old estate, a few miles out of\r\nLondon. It was the dairy farm of Queen Elizabeth, and presented by\r\nher to Sir Francis Walsingham. Since then it has been inhabited by\r\nmany persons of note. It has existed as an estate since the time of\r\nthe early Saxon Kings, and the record of the sale of Barn Elms in\r\nthe time of King Athelston is still extant. What with its well-kept\r\nlawns, fine old trees, and glimpses here and there of the Thames\r\nwinding round its borders, and its wealth of old associations, it\r\nis indeed a charming spot. Our memory of those days will not go\r\nback to Saxon Kings, but remain with the liberal host and hostess,\r\nthe beautiful children and the many charming acquaintances we met\r\nat that fireside. I doubt whether any of the ancient lords and\r\nladies who dispensed their hospitalities under that roof, did in\r\nany way surpass the present occupants. Mrs. McLaren, interested in\r\nall the reforms of the day, is radical in her ideas, a brilliant\r\ntalker, and, for one so young, remarkably well informed on all\r\npolitical questions. One thing is certain, those old walls never\r\nechoed to more rebellious talk among women against existing\r\nconditions,[578] than on that evening.\r\n\r\nIt was at Barn Elms I met for the first time Mrs. Fannie Hertz, to\r\nwhom I was indebted for many pleasant acquaintances afterwards. She\r\nis said to know more distinguished literary people than any other\r\nwoman in London. I saw her, too, several times in her own cozy\r\nhome, meeting at her Sunday-afternoon receptions many persons I was\r\ndesirous to know. On one occasion I found George Jacob Holyoake\r\nthere, surrounded by a bevy of young ladies, all stoutly defending\r\nthe Nihilists in Russia, and their right to plot their way to\r\nfreedom; they counted a dynasty of Czars as nothing in the balance\r\nwith the liberties of a whole people. As I joined the circle Mr.\r\nHolyoake called my attention to the fact that he was the only one\r\nin favor of peaceful measures among all those ladies. \"Now,\" said\r\nhe, \"I have often heard it said on your platform, that the feminine\r\nelement in politics would bring about perpetual peace in\r\ngovernment, and here all these ladies are advocating the worst\r\nforms of violence in the name of liberty.\" \"Ah,\" said I, \"lay on\r\ntheir shoulders the responsibility of governing, and they would\r\nsoon become as mild and conservative as you seem to be.\" He then\r\ngave us his views on cooeperation, the only remedy for many existing\r\nevils, which he thought would be the next step toward a higher\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThere, too, I met some Positivists, who, though quite reasonable on\r\nreligious questions, were very narrow on the sphere of woman. The\r\ndifference in sex, which is the very reason why men and women\r\nshould be associated in all spheres of activity, they make the\r\nstrongest reason why they should be separated. Mrs. Hertz belongs\r\nto the Harrison school of Positivists. I went with her to one of\r\nMrs. Orr's receptions, where we met Robert Browning, a fine looking\r\ngentleman of seventy years, with white hair and mustache. He is\r\nfrank, easy, playful, and a good talker. Mrs. Orr seemed to be\r\ntaking a very pessimistic view of our present sphere of action,\r\nwhich Mr. Browning, with poetic coloring, was trying to paint more\r\nhopeful.\r\n\r\nThe next day I dined with Mrs. Margaret Bright Lucas, in company\r\nwith Mr. John P. Thomasson, member of parliament, and his wife, and\r\nafterwards we went to the House of Commons and had the good fortune\r\nto hear Gladstone, Parnell, and Sir Charles Dilke. Seeing Bradlaugh\r\nseated outside the charmed circle, I sent my card to him, and in\r\nthe corridor we had a few moments' conversation. I asked him if he\r\nthought he would eventually get his seat; he replied, \"Most\r\nassuredly I will. I shall open the next campaign with such an\r\nagitation as will rouse our politicians to some consideration of\r\nthe changes gradually coming over the face of things in this\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nThe place assigned ladies in the House of Commons is really a\r\ndisgrace to a country ruled by an Empress. This dark perch is the\r\nhighest gallery immediately over the speaker's desk and government\r\nseats, behind a fine wire-work, so that it is quite impossible to\r\nsee or hear anything. The sixteen persons who can crowd in the\r\nfront seat, by standing with their noses partly through some open\r\nwork, can have the satisfaction of seeing the cranial arch of their\r\nrulers, and hearing an occasional pean to liberty, or an Irish\r\ngrowl at the lack of it. I was told this net work was to prevent\r\nthe members on the floor from being disturbed by the beauty of the\r\nwomen. On hearing this I remarked that I was devoutly thankful that\r\nour American men were not so easily disturbed, and that the beauty\r\nof our women was not of so dangerous a character.\r\n\r\nI could but contrast our spacious galleries in that magnificent\r\ncapitol at Washington, as well as in our grand State capitols,\r\nwhere hundreds of women can sit to see and hear their rulers at\r\ntheir ease, with these dark, dingy buildings, and such inadequate\r\naccommodations for the people. My son, who had a seat on the floor\r\njust opposite the ladies' gallery, said he could compare our\r\nappearance to nothing better than birds in a cage. He could not\r\ndistinguish an outline of anybody. All he could see was the moving\r\nof feathers and furs, or some bright ribbon or flower.\r\n\r\nIn the libraries, the courts, and the House of Lords, I found many\r\nsuggestive subjects of thought. Our American inventions seem to\r\nfurnish them cases for litigation. A suit in regard to Singer's\r\nsewing machine was just then occupying the attention of the Lord\r\nChancellor. Not feeling much interest in the matter, I withdrew and\r\njoined my friends, to examine some frescoes in the ante-room. It\r\nwas interesting to find so many historical scenes in which women\r\nhad taken a prominent part. Among others, there is Jane Lane\r\nassisting Charles II. to escape, and Alice Lisle concealing the\r\nfugitives after the battle of Sedgemoor. Six wives of Henry VIII.\r\nstand forth a solemn pageant when one recalls their sad fate. Alas!\r\nwhether for good or ill, woman must ever fill a large space in the\r\ntragedies of the world.\r\n\r\nI passed a few pleasant hours in the house where Macaulay spent his\r\nlast years. The once spacious library and the large bay window\r\nlooking out on a beautiful lawn, where he sat from day to day\r\nwriting his flowing periods, possessed a peculiar charm for me, as\r\nthe surroundings of genius always do. I thought as I stood there\r\nhow often he had unconsciously gazed on each object in sight in\r\nsearching for words rich enough to gild his ideas. The house is now\r\nowned and occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Winckworth. It was at\r\none of their sociable Sunday teas that many pleasant memories of\r\nthe great historian were revived.\r\n\r\nWe went with Mrs. Lucas to a meeting of the Salvation army, in\r\nExeter Hall, which holds 5,000 people. It was literally packed--not\r\nan inch of standing-room even, seemed to be unoccupied. This\r\nremarkable movement was then at its height of enthusiasm in\r\nEngland, and its leaders proposed to carry it round the world, but\r\nit has never been so successful in any other latitude. They not\r\nonly hold meetings, but they march through the streets, men and\r\nwomen, singing and playing on tambourines. The exercises on this\r\noccasion consisted of prayers, hymns, and exhortations by Mr. and\r\nMrs. Booth. When this immense audience all joined in the chorus of\r\ntheir stirring songs, it was indeed very impressive. The whole\r\neffect was like that of an old-fashioned Methodist revival meeting.\r\nI purchased their paper, _The War Cry_, and pasted it in my journal\r\nto show the wild vagaries to which the human mind is subject. There\r\nis nothing too ridiculous or monstrous to be done under the\r\ninfluence of religious enthusiasm. In spite, however, of the\r\nridicule attached to this movement, it is at least an aspiration\r\nfor that ignorant, impoverished multitude. The first thing they\r\nwere urged to do was to give up intoxicating drinks, and their\r\nvicious affiliations. If some other organization could take hold of\r\nthem at that point, to educate them in the rudiments of learning\r\nand right living, and supplement their emotions with a modicum of\r\nreason and common sense in the practical affairs of life, much\r\ngreater good might result from this initiative step in the right\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable and genial women we met was Miss Frances\r\nPower Cobbe. She called one evening at 10 Duchess street, and\r\nsipped with us the five o'clock cup of tea, a uniform practice in\r\nEngland. She is of medium height, stout, rosy, and vigorous\r\nlooking, with a large, well-shaped head, a strong, happy face, and\r\ngifted with rare powers of conversation. I felt very strongly\r\nattracted to her. She is frank and cordial and pronounced in all\r\nher opinions. She gave us an account of her efforts to rescue\r\nunhappy cats and dogs from the hands of the vivisectionists. We saw\r\nher, too, in her own cozy home and in her office in Victoria Row.\r\nThe perfect order in which her books and papers were all arranged,\r\nand the exquisite neatness of the apartments were refreshing to\r\nbehold.\r\n\r\nMy daughter, having decided opinions of her own, was soon at\r\nloggerheads with Miss Cobbe on the question of vivisection. After\r\nshowing us several German and French books with illustrations of\r\nthe horrible cruelty inflicted on cats and dogs, enlarging on the\r\nhypocrisy and wickedness of these scientists, she turned to my\r\ndaughter and said, \"Would you shake hands with one of these\r\nvivisectionists?\" \"Yes,\" said Harriot, \"I should be proud to shake\r\nhands with Virchow, the great German scientist, for his kindness to\r\na young American girl. She applied to several professors to be\r\nadmitted to their classes, but all refused except Virchow; he\r\nreadily assented, and requested his students to treat her with\r\nbecoming courtesy. 'If any of you behave otherwise,' said he, 'I\r\nshall feel myself personally insulted.' She entered his classes and\r\npursued her studies unmolested and with great success. \"Now,\" said\r\nshe, \"would you refuse to shake hands with any of your statesmen,\r\nscientists, clergymen, lawyers or physicians, who treat women with\r\nconstant indignities and insults?\" \"Oh, no\"; said Miss Cobbe.\r\n\"Then,\" said Mrs. Blatch, \"you estimate the physical suffering of\r\ncats and dogs as of more consequence than the humiliation of human\r\nbeings. The man who tortures a cat for a scientific purpose is not\r\nas low in the scale of being, in my judgment, as one who sacrifices\r\nhis own daughter to some cruel custom.\" Though Miss Cobbe weighs\r\nover two hundred pounds, she is as light on foot as a deer and is\r\nsaid to be a great walker. After seeing her I read again some of\r\nher books. Her theology now and then evidently cramps her, yet her\r\nstyle is vigorous, earnest, sarcastic, though at times playful and\r\npathetic. In regard to her theology, she says she is too liberal to\r\nplease her orthodox friends and too orthodox to please the\r\nliberals, hence in religion she stands quite solitary.\r\n\r\nSuffering from the effects of the prolonged fogs, we took our\r\nletters of introduction from Dr. Bayard of New York to the two\r\nleading high-dilution homeopathic physicians in London, Drs. Wilson\r\nand Berridge. We found the former a good talker and very original.\r\nWe were greatly amused with his invectives against the quacks in\r\nthe profession; the \"mongrels,\" as he called the low dilutionists.\r\nThe first question he asked my daughter was if she wore high heels;\r\nhe said he would not attempt to cure any woman of any disease so\r\nlong as she was perched on her toes with her spine out of plumb.\r\nHis advice to me was to get out of the London fogs as quickly as\r\npossible. No one who has not suffered a London fog can imagine the\r\nterrible gloom that pervades everywhere. One can see nothing out of\r\nthe windows but a dense black smoke. Drivers carry flambeaux in the\r\nstreets to avoid running into each other. The houses are full; the\r\ngas burns all day, but you can scarcely see across the room;\r\ntheaters and places of amusement are sometimes closed, as nothing\r\ncan be seen distinctly. We called on Dr. Berridge, also, thinking\r\nit best to make the acquaintance of both that we might decide from\r\ntheir general appearance, surroundings, conversation and\r\ncomparative intelligence, which one we would prefer to trust in an\r\nemergency. We found both alike so promising that we felt we could\r\ntrust either to give us our quietus, if die we must, on the high\r\ndilutions. It is a consolation to know that one's closing hours at\r\nleast are passed in harmony with the principles of pure science. On\r\nfurther acquaintance we found these gentlemen true disciples of the\r\ngreat Hahneman.\r\n\r\nAs we were just then reading Froude's \"Life of Carlyle,\" we drove\r\nby the house where he lived and paused a moment at the door, where\r\npoor Jennie went in and out so often with a heavy heart. It is a\r\npainful record of a great soul struggling with poverty and\r\ndisappointment; the hope of success as an author so long deferred\r\nand never wholly realized. His foolish pride of independence and\r\nheadship, and his utter obliviousness as to his domestic duties and\r\nthe comfort of his wife, made the picture still darker. Poor\r\nJennie, fitted to shine in any circle, yet doomed all her married\r\nlife to domestic drudgery, with no associations with the great man\r\nfor whose literary companionship she had sacrificed herself. It\r\nadds greatly to one's interest in Scott, Dickens, Thackeray,\r\nCharlotte Bronte, Bulwer, James and George Eliot, to read them\r\namidst the scenes where they lived and died. Thus in my leisure\r\nhours, after the fatigues of sight-seeing and visiting, I re-read\r\nmany of these authors near the places where they spent their last\r\ndays on earth.\r\n\r\nAs I had visited Ambleside forty years before and seen Harriet\r\nMartineau in her prime, I did not go with Miss Anthony to Lake\r\nWindermere. She found the well-known house occupied by Mr. William\r\nHenry Hills, a liberal Quaker named after William Henry Channing.\r\nMrs. Hills received the party with great hospitality, showed them\r\nthrough all the apartments and pointed out the charming views from\r\nthe windows. They paused a few moments reverently in the chamber\r\nwhere that grand woman had passed her last triumphant days on\r\nearth. On the kitchen hearth was still sitting her favorite cat,\r\nsixteen years old, the spots in her yellow and black fur as marked\r\nas ever. Puss is the observed of all observers who visit that\r\nsacred shrine, and it is said she seems specially to enjoy the\r\nattention of strangers. From here Miss Anthony drove round\r\nGrasmere, the romantic home of Wordsworth, wandered through the old\r\nchurch, sat in the pew he so often occupied and lingered near the\r\nlast resting-place of the great poet. As the former residence of\r\nthe anti-slavery agitator, Thomas Clarkson, was on Ulswater,\r\nanother of the beautiful lakes in that region, Miss Anthony\r\nextended her excursion still further and learned from the people\r\nmany pleasing characteristics of these celebrated personages. On\r\nher way to Ireland she stopped at Ulverston and visited Miss Hannah\r\nGoad, who was a descendant of the founder of Quakerism, George Fox.\r\nShe was in the old house in which he was married to Margaret Fell\r\nand where they lived many years; attended the quaint little church\r\nwhere he often spoke from the high seats, looked through his\r\nwell-worn Bible, and the minutes of their monthly meetings, kept by\r\nMargaret Fell two centuries ago.\r\n\r\nReturning to London we attended one of Miss Biggs' receptions and\r\namong others met Mr. Stansfeld, M. P., who had labored faithfully\r\nfor the repeal of the Contagious Diseases acts, and in a measure\r\nbeen successful. We had the honor of an interview with Lord\r\nShaftsbury at one of his crowded receptions, and found him a little\r\nuncertain as to the wisdom of allowing married women to vote, for\r\nfear of disturbing the peace of the family. I have often wondered\r\nif men see in this objection what fatal admissions they make as to\r\ntheir own selfishness and love of domination.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony was present at the great Liberal conference at Leeds\r\non October 17, to which Mrs. Helen Bright Clark, Miss Jane Cobden,\r\nMrs. Tanner, Mrs. Scatcherd and several other ladies were duly\r\nelected delegates from their respective Liberal leagues, and\r\noccupied seats on the floor. Mrs. Clark and Miss Cobden, daughters\r\nof the great Corn-law reformers, spoke eloquently in favor of the\r\nresolution to extend parliamentary suffrage to women, which was\r\npresented by Walter McLaren of Bradford. As these young women made\r\ntheir impassioned appeals for the recognition of woman's political\r\nequality in the next bill for the extension of suffrage, that\r\nimmense gathering of 1,600 delegates was hushed into profound\r\nsilence. For a daughter to speak thus in that great representative\r\nconvention in direct opposition to her loved and honored father,\r\nthe acknowledged leader of that party, was an act of heroism and\r\nfidelity to her own highest convictions almost without a parallel\r\nin English history, and the effect on the audience was as thrilling\r\nas it was surprising. The resolution was passed by a large\r\nmajority. At the reception given to Mr. John Bright that evening,\r\nas Mrs. Clark approached the dais on which her noble father stood\r\nshaking the hands of passing friends, she remarked to her husband,\r\n\"I wonder if father has heard of my speech this morning, and if he\r\nwill forgive me for thus publicly differing with him?\" The query\r\nwas soon answered. As he caught the first glimpse of his daughter\r\nhe stepped down and, pressing her hand affectionately, kissed her\r\nwith a fond father's warmth on either cheek in turn. The next\r\nevening the great Quaker statesman was heard by the admiring\r\nthousands who could crowd into Victoria Hall, while thousands,\r\nequally desirous to hear, failed to get tickets of admission. It\r\nwas a magnificent sight, and altogether a most impressive gathering\r\nof the people. Miss Anthony with her friends sat in the gallery\r\nopposite the great platform, where they had a fine view of the\r\nwhole audience. When John Bright, escorted by Sir Wilfred Lawson,\r\ntook his seat, the immense audience rose, waving hats and\r\nhandkerchiefs and with the wildest enthusiasm giving cheer after\r\ncheer in honor of the great leader. Sir Wilfred Lawson in his\r\nintroductory remarks facetiously alluded to the resolution adopted\r\nby the conference as somewhat in advance of the ideas of the\r\nspeaker of the evening. The house broke into roars of laughter,\r\nwhile the father of Liberalism, perfectly convulsed, joined in the\r\ngeneral merriment.\r\n\r\nBut when at length his time to speak had come, and Mr. Bright went\r\nover the many steps of progress that had been taken by the Liberal\r\nparty, he cunningly dodged all in the direction of the emancipation\r\nof the women of England. He skipped round the agitation in 1867 and\r\nJohn Stuart Mill's amendment presented at that time in the House of\r\nCommons; the extension of the municipal suffrage in 1869; the\r\nparticipation of women in the establishment of national schools\r\nunder the law of 1870, both as voters and members of school-boards;\r\nthe Married Woman's Property bill of 1882; the large and increasing\r\nvote for the extension of parliamentary suffrage in the House of\r\nCommons, and the adoption of the resolution by that great\r\nconference the day before. All these successive steps towards\r\nwoman's emancipation he carefully remembered to forget.\r\n\r\nDuring Miss Anthony's stay in Leeds she and her cousin, Dr. Fannie\r\nDickinson, were guests of Mrs. Hannah Ford at Adel Grange, an old\r\nand lovely suburban home, where she met many interesting women,\r\nmembers of the school-board, poor-law guardians and others. The\r\nthree daughters of Mrs. Ford, though possessed of ample incomes,\r\nhave each a purpose in life; one had gathered hundreds of factory\r\ngirls into evening schools, where she taught them to cut and make\r\ntheir garments, as well as to read and write; one was an artist and\r\nthe third a musician, having studied in London and Florence. It was\r\nduring this ever-to-be-remembered week that Miss Anthony, escorted\r\nby Mrs. Ford, visited Haworth, the bleak and lonely home of the\r\nBrontes. It was a dark, drizzly October day, intensifying all the\r\ngloomy memories of the place. She sat in the old church pew where\r\nthose shivering girls endured such discomforts through the fearful\r\nservices, with their benumbed feet on the very stone slab that from\r\ntime to time was taken up to deposit in the earth beneath their\r\nloved dead! She was shown through the house, paused at the place\r\nunder the stairs where the imperial Shirley had her fierce\r\nencounter with that almost human dog, Keeper; she stood in the\r\ndrawing-room where the sainted three sisters, arm-in-arm, paced up\r\nand down plotting their weird stories. She walked through the same\r\nold gate, on the same single stone pavement and over the same stile\r\nout into the same heather fields, gazing on the same dreary sky\r\nabove and the same desolate earth on every side. She dined in the\r\nsame old \"Black Bull\"; sat in poor Branwell's chair and was served\r\nby the same person who dealt out the drinks to that poor\r\nunfortunate--then a young bar-maid, now the aged proprietor.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony crossed from Barrow to Belfast, where she was given a\r\nmost cordial reception at the house of one of Ireland's\r\ndistinguished orators, Miss Isabella M. Tod, who took her to one of\r\nher Ulster temperance meetings at Garvah, where they were the\r\nguests of Rev. Thomas Medill, a cousin of the distinguished Chicago\r\neditor. There, as Miss Anthony listened to the prayers and\r\nexhortations of the Presbyterian ministers and to the arguments of\r\nMiss Tod, and heard no appeals to the audience to join in the work\r\nof suppressing the traffic, a realizing sense of the utter\r\npowerlessness of the queen's subjects in Ireland dawned upon her\r\nfor the first time. In all that crowd there was not one who had any\r\nvoice in the decision of that question. The entire control of the\r\nmatter rested with three magistrates appointed by the queen, who\r\nare in nowise responsible to the tax-paying people to whom they\r\nadminister the laws. Had Miss Tod been addressing an American\r\naudience, she would have appealed to every man to vote only for\r\ncandidates pledged to no-license. From Garvah they made a\r\npilgrimage to the Giant's Causeway. Miss Anthony had, when at Oban,\r\nvisited Fingal's Cave, and the two wonders that always fix\r\nthemselves upon the imagination of the youthful student of the\r\nworld's geography fully matched her expectations.\r\n\r\nAt Dublin she visited the Castle, the old parliament building, now\r\na bank; Kings and Queens College, that gives diplomas to women;\r\nthe parks, the cemeteries, the tomb of Daniel O'Connell. She\r\nattended a meeting of the common council, of which Alfred Webb, the\r\nonly surviving son of the old abolitionist, Richard D. Webb, was a\r\nmember, and there she listened to a discussion on a petition to the\r\nqueen that the people of Dublin might be allowed to elect their own\r\ntax-collector instead of having one placed over them by \"the powers\r\nthat be\" at London, as the official thus appointed had just proved\r\na defaulter. In listening to the outrages perpetrated upon a\r\nhelpless people by foreign officials, the one wonder to her was,\r\nnot that so many of Ireland's sons are discontented, but that they\r\nare not in open rebellion.\r\n\r\nThere Miss Anthony made the acquaintance of numbers of excellent\r\nFriends,[579] and with Mrs. Haslam visited their large free library\r\nand attended their First-day meeting. In Dublin, too, she met\r\nMichael Davitt, who seemed to her a most sincere champion of\r\nliberty for himself and his people. Miss Anthony spent a week with\r\nMr. and Mrs. Haslam in Cork, visiting Blarney Castle, the old\r\nwalled city of Youghal with its crumbling Quaker meeting-house and\r\nfine old mansion in which Sir Walter Raleigh lived, and thence to\r\nthe beautiful Lakes of Killarney, and in a jaunting-car through the\r\nevicted tenants' district, entering the hovels and talking with the\r\ninmates. The sad stories poured into her ears, and the poverty and\r\nwretchedness she saw, proved to her that none of Mr. Redpath's\r\nrevelations, so shocking to the humanity of our people, were in the\r\nleast over-drawn. The circuit through Limerick, Galway, Clifton and\r\nBelfast was made in third-class cars, that she might talk with the\r\npeople of the working class. This was the season for their county\r\nfairs, which gave her an opportunity to see the farmers driving\r\ntheir cattle and taking their meagre products to the fair. The\r\nwomen and girls were uniformly barefooted, while some of the men\r\nand boys wore shoes. In reply to her query why this was so, one man\r\nsaid, \"It is all we can do to get shoes for them as airnes the\r\nmoney.\" The same old story; woman's work, however arduous, brings\r\nno price in the market.\r\n\r\nWhile in London we attended several large and enthusiastic reform\r\nmeetings. We heard Bradlaugh address his constituency on that\r\nmemorable day at Trafalgar Square, at the opening of parliament,\r\nwhen violence was anticipated and the parliament houses were\r\nsurrounded by immense crowds, with the military and police in large\r\nnumbers to maintain order. We heard Michael Davitt and Miss Helen\r\nTaylor at a great meeting in Exeter Hall, the former on home-rule\r\nfor Ireland, and the latter on the nationalization of land, showing\r\nthat in ancient times the people had many privileges long since\r\ndenied. They even had forests and commons and the road-side, where\r\ntheir cows, sheep and geese could glean something. The facts and\r\nfigures given in these two lectures as to the abject poverty of the\r\npeople and the cruel system by which every inch of land had been\r\ngrabbed by their oppressors, were indeed appalling. A few days\r\nbefore sailing we made our last visit to Ernestine L. Rose and\r\nfound our noble coadjutor, though in delicate health, pleasantly\r\nsituated in the heart of London, as deeply interested as ever in\r\nthe struggles of the hour.\r\n\r\nDining one day with Mrs. Lucas, we were forcibly impressed with the\r\ngrowing liberality of people of all shades of belief and of all\r\nprofessions. The guests on that occasion were Mrs. Hallock,\r\nsister-in-law of Robert Dale Owen, thoroughly imbued with his\r\nreligious and social ideas; Dr. Mary J. Hall, the only woman\r\npracticing homeopathy in England; Miss Henrietta Mueller, member of\r\nthe London school-board; Miss Clara Spence, a young actress from\r\nAmerica, who gave us some fine recitations; and such liberals in\r\npolitics and religion as Mrs. Stanton Blatch and myself, while our\r\nhostess was an orthodox Friend. However we were all agreed on one\r\npoint, the right of women to full equality everywhere. In the\r\nevening we went to see Mrs. Hallock's daughter, Ella Deitz, in the\r\nplay of \"Impulse.\" We urged Mrs. Lucas to accompany us, but she\r\nsaid she had never been to a theater in her life.\r\n\r\nA great discomfort in all English homes is the cold draughts\r\nthrough their halls and unoccupied rooms. A moderate fire in the\r\ngrates in the family apartments is their only mode of heating, and\r\nthey seem quite oblivious as to the danger of throwing a door open\r\ninto a cold hall on one's back while the servants pass in and out\r\nwith the various courses' at dinner. As we Americans were sorely\r\ntried under such circumstances, it was decided in the Basingstoke\r\nmansion to have a hall stove, which, after a prolonged search, was\r\nfound in London and duly installed as a presiding deity to defy the\r\ndampness that pervades all those ivy-covered habitations, as well\r\nas the neuralgia that wrings their possessors. What a blessing it\r\nproved, more than any one thing making the old English house seem\r\nlike an American home! The delightful summer heat we in America\r\nenjoy in the coldest weather is quite unknown to our Saxon cousins.\r\nAlthough many came to see our stove in full working order, yet we\r\ncould not persuade them to adopt the American system of heating the\r\nwhole house at an even temperature. They cling to the customs of\r\ntheir fathers with an obstinacy that is incomprehensible to us, who\r\nare always ready to try experiments. Americans complain bitterly of\r\nthe same freezing experiences in France and Germany, and in turn\r\nforeigners all criticise our over-heated houses and places of\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nAn evening reception at Mrs. Richardson's, in the city of York,\r\ngave us an opportunity of a personal greeting with a large circle\r\nof ladies identified with the suffrage movement, and a large public\r\nmeeting the next day in the Town Hall enabled us to judge still\r\nfurther of the merits of English women as speakers. Here I was\r\nentertained by Mrs. Lucretia Kendall Clarke, an American, who had\r\nspent five years as a student in Dresden, where she made the\r\nacquaintance of Mr. Clarke. It is said in England that the\r\nAmerican girls capture all the choice young men; that our rich\r\ncattle-dealers get all their best horses, cows, sheep, dogs, and\r\nthat in time we shall rob them of all that is best in the country.\r\nOne thing is certain, we shall always regret our hospitable\r\ninvitation to the sparrows, as they are making war on our native\r\nbirds instead of fulfilling their mission to the \"Diet of Worms.\"\r\nIn company with Mrs. Scatcherd we spent an hour in that magnificent\r\nYork cathedral, said to be one of the finest in England. Being\r\nthere at the time for service we had the benefit of the music. To\r\nus, lost in admiration of the wonderful architecture and the\r\nbeautiful carving in wood and stone, the solemn strains of the\r\norgan reverberating through those vast arches made the whole scene\r\nvery impressive. As women in many of the churches are not permitted\r\nto take part in the sacred ceremonies, the choir is composed of\r\nmen, and boys from ten to fifteen who sing the soprano and alto.\r\nBut these old ideas, like the old Roman wall that still surrounds\r\nthat city, time only can remove.\r\n\r\nWe had a merry trip from York to London. Miss Mueller, Mrs. Chant,\r\nMrs. Shearer, Miss Stackpole, in our compartment, discussed freely\r\nthe silly objections to woman's enfranchisement usually made by\r\nour legislators. We found on comparing notes that the arguments\r\nusually made were the same in the House of Commons as in the halls\r\nof Congress. If the honorable gentlemen could only have heard their\r\nstale platitudes with good imitations in voice and manner, I doubt\r\nwhether they would ever again air their absurdities. I regretted\r\nthat our Caroline Gilkey Rogers had not been there to have given\r\nher admirable impersonation of a Massachusetts legislator.\r\n\r\nA few days later I attended another meeting in Birmingham and\r\nstayed with a relative of Joseph Sturge, at whose home I had\r\nvisited forty years before. This was called to discuss the\r\ndegradation of women under the Contagious Diseases acts. Led by\r\nJosephine Butler, the women of England have been deeply stirred on\r\nthe question of repeal, and are very active in their opposition to\r\nthe law. We heard Mrs. Butler speak in many of her society\r\nmeetings, as well as on several public occasions. Her style is not\r\nunlike that we hear in Methodist class-meetings from the best\r\ncultivated of that sect; her power grows out of her deeply\r\nreligious enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIn London we met Emily Faithful, who had just returned from a\r\nlecturing-tour in the United States, and were much amused with her\r\nexperiences. Having taken prolonged trips over the whole country\r\nfrom Maine to Texas for many successive years, Miss Anthony and I\r\ncould easily add the superlative to all her narrations. She dined\r\nwith us one day at Mrs. Mellen's, where we also had the pleasure of\r\nmeeting Miss Jane Cobden, a daughter of the great Corn-law\r\nreformer, who was much interested in forming Liberal leagues, to\r\nencourage the Liberal party and interest women in the political\r\nquestions under consideration. She passed a day with us at\r\nBasingstoke, and together we visited Mrs. Caird, the author of\r\n\"Whom Nature Leadeth,\" an interesting story of English life. I\r\nfound the author a charming woman, but in spite of the title I\r\nreally could not find one character in the three volumes that\r\nseemed to follow the teachings of nature.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks again in London, visiting picture-galleries, museums,\r\nlibraries, going to teas, dinners, receptions, concerts, theaters\r\nand reform-meetings; it is enough to turn one's head to think of\r\nall the different clubs and associations managed by women. It was a\r\nsource of constant pleasure to me to drive about in hansoms and try\r\nto take in the vastness of that wonderful city; to see the\r\nbeautiful equipages, fine saddle-horses and riders and the skill\r\nwith which the bicycles were so rapidly engineered through the\r\ncrowded streets. The general use of bicycles and tricycles all over\r\nEngland, even for long journeys, is fast becoming the favorite mode\r\nof locomotion both for ladies and gentlemen.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasant surprise to meet the large number of Americans\r\nusually at the receptions of Mrs. Peter Taylor.[580] Graceful and\r\nbeautiful in full dress, standing beside her husband, who evidently\r\nidolizes her, Mrs. Taylor appeared quite as refined in her\r\ndrawing-room as if she had never been \"exposed to the public gaze,\"\r\nwhile presiding over a suffrage convention. Mr. Peter Taylor, M.\r\nP., has been untiring in his endeavors to get a bill through\r\nparliament against \"compulsory vaccination.\" Mrs. Taylor is called\r\nthe mother of the suffrage movement. The engraving of her sweet\r\nface which adorns the English chapter will give the reader a good\r\nidea of her character. The reform has not been carried on in all\r\nrespects to her taste, nor on what she considers the basis of high\r\nprinciple. Neither she nor Mrs. Jacob Bright has ever been\r\nsatisfied with the bill asking the right of suffrage for \"widows\r\nand spinsters\" only. To have asked this right \"for all women duly\r\nqualified,\" as but few married women are qualified by possessing\r\nproperty in their own right, the result would have been\r\nsubstantially the same without making any invidious distinctions.\r\nMrs. Taylor and Mrs. Bright felt that as married women were the\r\ngreatest sufferers under the law, they should be the first rather\r\nthan the last to be enfranchised. The others, led by Miss Becker,\r\nclaimed that it was good policy to make the demand for \"spinsters\r\nand widows,\" and thus exclude the \"family unit\" and \"man's\r\nheadship\" from the discussion; and yet these were the very points\r\non which the objections were invariably based. They claimed that if\r\n\"spinsters and widows\" were enfranchised they would be an added\r\npower to secure to married women their rights. But the history of\r\nthe past gives no such assurance. It is not certain that women\r\nwould be more just than men, and a small privileged class of\r\naristocrats have long governed their fellow-countrymen. The fact\r\nthat the spinsters in the movement advocated such a bill shows that\r\nthey are not to be trusted in extending it. John Stuart Mill, too,\r\nwas always opposed to the exclusion of married women in the demand\r\nfor suffrage.\r\n\r\nIf our English friends had our system of conventions and\r\ndiscussions in which every resolution is subject to criticism,\r\nchanges could be more readily effected. But as their meetings are\r\nnow conducted, a motion to amend a resolution would throw the\r\nplatform into the wildest confusion and hopelessly bewilder the\r\nchairman. We saw this experiment made at the great demonstration in\r\nSt. James' Hall the night before Mr. Mason's bill was to be acted\r\non in the House of Commons. For its effect on their champions some\r\nwere desirous that a resolution should be endorsed by that great\r\naudience proposing higher ground; that instead of \"spinsters and\r\nwidows,\" the demand should be for \"all duly qualified women.\" After\r\nthe reading of one of the resolutions Miss Jessie Craigen arose and\r\nproposed such an amendment. Mr. Woodhall, M. P., in the chair,\r\nseemed quite at a loss what to do. She was finally, after much\r\ndebate and prolonged confusion, suppressed, whether in a\r\nparliamentary manner or not I am unable to say. Here we should have\r\ndiscussed the matter at length if it had taken us until midnight,\r\nor adjourned over until next day, \"the spinsters and widows\" having\r\nbeen the target for all our barbed arrows until completely\r\nannihilated.\r\n\r\nSpending two months in traveling on the continent, Miss Anthony had\r\nmany amusing experiences. While visiting our minister and his wife,\r\nMr. and Mrs. Sargent, at Berlin, she occupied some rainy days, when\r\nsight-seeing was out of the question, in doing up papers and\r\nwriting a large number of letters on our official paper, bearing\r\nthe revolutionary mottoes, \"No just government can be formed\r\nwithout the consent of the governed,\" \"Taxation without\r\nrepresentation is tyranny.\" For a brief period she was in the full\r\nenjoyment of that freedom one has when a pressing duty to family\r\nand friends has been thoroughly discharged. But alas! her\r\nsatisfaction was soon turned to disappointment. After a few days a\r\ndignified official appeared at the American Legation with a large\r\npackage bearing the proscribed mottoes, saying, \"such sentiments\r\ncannot pass through the post-office in Germany.\" So all that form\r\nof propagandism was nipped in the bud, and in modest, uncomplaining\r\nwraps the letters and papers started again for the land of the free\r\nand reached their destination.\r\n\r\nBut this experience did not satisfy the \"Napoleon of our movement\"\r\nthat the rulers in the old world could securely guard their\r\nsubjects from those inflammable mottoes to which from long use we\r\nare so indifferent. She continued to sow the seeds of rebellion as\r\nshe had opportunity, in Germany, France, Switzerland and Italy. It\r\nis well for us that she did not experiment in Russia, or we should\r\nnow be mourning her loss as an exile in Siberia. At all points of\r\ninterest books are kept for visitors to register their names; Miss\r\nAnthony uniformly added some of our Pilgrim Fathers' heroic\r\nejaculations in their struggle for liberty, which friends visiting\r\nthe same places afterwards informed us were carefully crossed out\r\nso as to be quite illegible. But we may hope for their restoration\r\nin the near future and that they may yet do an effective work. Thus\r\ncircumscribed with her pen and not being able to speak a foreign\r\nlanguage, happily no rebellions were fomented by her rapid transit\r\nthrough their borders.\r\n\r\nMy sense of justice was severely tried with all I heard of the\r\npersecutions of Mrs. Besant and Mr. Bradlaugh for their\r\npublications on the right and duty of parents to limit population.\r\nWho can contemplate the sad condition of multitudes of young\r\nchildren in the old world whose fate is to be brought up in\r\nignorance and vice--a swarming, seething mass whom nobody\r\nowns--without seeing the need of free discussion of the\r\nphilosophical principles that underlie these tangled social\r\nproblems. The trials of Foote and Ramsey, too, for blasphemy,\r\nseemed unworthy a great nation in the nineteenth century. Think of\r\nwell-educated men of good moral standing, thrown into prison in\r\nsolitary confinement for speaking lightly of the Hebrew idea of\r\nJehovah and the New Testament account of the birth of Jesus! Our\r\nProtestant clergy never hesitate to make the dogmas and\r\nsuperstitions of the Catholic church seem as absurd as possible,\r\nand why should not those who imagine they have outgrown Protestant\r\nsuperstitions make them equally ridiculous? Whatever is true can\r\nstand investigation and ridicule.\r\n\r\nThe last of April, when the wild-flowers were in their glory, Mrs.\r\nMellen and her lovely daughter, Daisy, came down to Basingstoke to\r\nenjoy its beauty. As Mrs. Mellen had known Charles Kingsley and\r\nentertained him at her residence in Colorado, she felt a desire to\r\nsee his former home. Accordingly, one bright morning Mr. Blatch\r\ndrove us through Stralfieldsage over the grounds of the Duke of\r\nWellington, well stocked with fine cattle, sheep and deer. This\r\nmagnificent place was given him by the English government after the\r\nbattle of Waterloo. A lofty statue of the duke that can be seen for\r\nmiles around stands at the entrance. A drive of a few miles further\r\nbrought us to Eversley, the home of Canon Kingsley, where he\r\npreached many years and where all that is mortal of him now lies\r\nburied. We wandered through the old church, among the moss-covered\r\ntombstones and into the once happy home, now silent and deserted,\r\nhis loved ones scattered in different quarters of the globe.\r\nStanding near the last resting-place of the author of \"Hypatia,\"\r\nhis warning words for woman, in a letter to John Stuart Mill,\r\nseemed like a voice from the clouds, saying with new inspiration\r\nand power, \"This will never be a good world for woman until the\r\nlast remnant of the canon law is civilized off the face of the\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Mellen's spacious home in Pembroke Gardens, Kensington, was\r\nthrown open for her American friends in London to celebrate the\r\nFourth of July. A large number of our English acquaintances were\r\nalso present, who very kindly congratulated us on the stirring\r\nevents of that day in 1776. Of the Americans assembled, many\r\ncontributed to the general entertainment. Grace Greenwood, Miss\r\nRachel Foster, Miss Kate Hillard and Miss Mildred Conway gave\r\nrecitations. Miss Lippincott, daughter of Grace Greenwood, sang\r\nsome fine operatic music; Mrs. Carpenter of Chicago sang sweetly,\r\nplaying her own accompaniment; Mr. Frank Lincoln gave some of his\r\namusing impersonations; Miss Maud Powell of Chicago, only fourteen\r\nyears of age, who had been taking lessons in France and Germany for\r\nsome years, played exquisite airs on the violin; Mrs. Flora Stark,\r\nMiss Alice Blatch and Miss Conway gave us some fine classical music\r\non the piano, and Nathaniel Mellen sang some pathetic negro\r\nmelodies.[581] Altogether it was a pleasant occasion and I felt\r\nquite proud of the varied talents manifested by our young people.\r\nSome English friends remarked on their cleverness and readiness,\r\nall spontaneously called out without any time for preparation.\r\n\r\nWe heard Mr. Fawcett speak to his Hackney constituents at one\r\nof his campaign meetings. In the course of his remarks he\r\nmentioned with evident favor as one of the coming measures the\r\ndisestablishment of the church, and was greeted with loud applause.\r\nSoon after he spoke of woman suffrage as another question demanding\r\nconsideration, but this was received with laughter and jeers,\r\nalthough the platform was crowded with advocates of the measure,\r\namong whom were the wife of the speaker and her sister, Dr. Garrett\r\nAnderson, who sat just behind him. The audience were evidently in\r\nfavor of releasing themselves from being taxed to support the\r\nchurch, forgetting that women were taxed also not only to support\r\nthe church, in which they had no voice, but the State, too, with\r\nits army and navy. Mr. Fawcett was not an orator, but a simple,\r\nstraightforward speaker. He made but one gesture, striking his\r\nright clenched fist into the palm of the left hand at the close of\r\nall his strongest assertions; but being sound and liberal, he was a\r\ngreat favorite with his constituents.\r\n\r\nA pleasant trip southward through Bath to Bristol brought us to the\r\nhome of the Misses Priestman and Mrs. Tanner, sisters-in-law of\r\nJohn Bright. I had stayed at their father's house forty years\r\nbefore, so we felt like old friends. I found them all charming,\r\nliberal women, and we enjoyed a few days together, talking over our\r\nmutual struggles, and admiring the beautiful scenery for which that\r\npart of the country is quite celebrated. The women of England were\r\njust then organizing political clubs, and I was invited to speak\r\nbefore the one in Bristol. They are composed of men and women\r\nalike, for the discussion of all political questions. The next day\r\nI spoke to women alone in the church on the Bible view of woman's\r\ncreation and destiny. It is strange that those who pretend to be\r\nwell-versed in Scripture do not see that the simultaneous creation\r\nof man and woman and the complete equality of the sexes are as\r\nclearly taught in the first chapter of Genesis as the reverse is in\r\nthe allegorical garden-scene in the second. The drive over the\r\nsuspension-bridge by moonlight to dine with Mrs. Garnet, a sister\r\nof John Thomasson, M. P., was a pleasant episode to public speaking\r\nand more serious conversation. There, too, we had an evening\r\nreception. There is an earnestness of purpose among English women\r\nthat is very encouraging under the prolonged disappointments\r\nreformers inevitably suffer. There is something so determined and\r\nheroic in what Mary Priestman does and says that one would readily\r\nfollow her through all dangers. It added much to my comfort in\r\nthis visit to have an escort in Mrs. Lucas.\r\n\r\nLater Miss Anthony visited Bristol and had a complimentary\r\nreception at the Misses Priestman's. She was the guest of Miss Mary\r\nEstlin, who had spent some time in America, a dear friend of Sarah\r\nPugh and Parker Pillsbury. Miss Estlin was from home during my\r\nvisit, so that I did not see her while in England. The order of\r\nEnglish homes among the wealthy classes is very enjoyable. All goes\r\non from year to year with the same servants, the same surroundings,\r\nno changes, no moving, no building even; in delightful contrast\r\nwith our periodical upheavings, always uncertain where we shall go\r\nnext, or how long our main dependents will stand by us.\r\n\r\nFrom Bristol we went to Greenbank to visit Mrs. Helen Bright Clark,\r\na daughter of the great orator. In the evening the parlors were\r\ncrowded, and I was asked to give an account of the suffrage\r\nmovement in America. Some clergymen questioned me in regard to the\r\nBible position of woman, whereupon I gave quite an exposition of\r\nits general principles in favor of liberty and equality. As two\r\nquite distinct lines of argument can be woven out of those pages on\r\nany subject, on this occasion I selected all the most favorable\r\ntexts for justice to woman, and closed by stating the limits of its\r\nauthority. Mrs. Clarke, though thoroughly in sympathy with the\r\nviews I had expressed, feared lest my very liberal utterances might\r\nhave shocked some of the strictest of the laymen and clergy.\r\n\"Well,\" I said, \"if we who do see the absurdities of the old\r\nsuperstitions never unveil them to others, how is the world to make\r\nany progress in the theologies? I am now in the sunset of life, and\r\nI feel it to be my special mission to tell people what they are not\r\nprepared to hear, instead of echoing worn-out opinions.\" The result\r\nshowed the wisdom of my speaking out of my own soul. To the\r\nsurprise of Mrs. Clark, the primitive Methodist clergyman called on\r\nSunday morning to invite me to occupy his pulpit in the afternoon\r\nand present the same line of thought I had the previous evening. I\r\naccepted his invitation. He led the services and I took my text\r\nfrom Genesis i., 27, 28, showing that man and woman were a\r\nsimultaneous creation, endowed with equal power in starting.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Clark I found very agreeable, progressive people, with\r\na nice family of boys and girls. Like all English children, they\r\nsuffered too much repression, while our American children have too\r\nmuch latitude. If we could strike the happy medium between the two\r\nsystems, it would be a great benefit to the children of both\r\ncountries. The next day we drove down to see Glastonbury cathedral.\r\nEngland is full of these beautiful ruins, covered with flowers and\r\nivy, but the saddest spectacles, with all this fading glory, are\r\nthe men, women and children whose nakedness neither man nor nature\r\nseeks to drape.\r\n\r\nReturning to London we accepted an invitation to take tea with Mrs.\r\nJacob Bright. A choice circle of three it was, and a large server\r\nof tempting viands was placed on a small table before us. Mrs.\r\nBright, in earnest conversation, had helped us each to a cup of\r\ntea, and was turning to help us to something more, when over went\r\ntable and all, tea, bread and butter, cake, strawberries and cream,\r\nsilver, china, in one conglomerate mass. Silence reigned. No one\r\nstarted; no one said \"Oh!\" Mrs. Bright went on with what she was\r\nsaying as if nothing unusual had occurred, rang the bell, and when\r\nthe servant appeared, pointing to the _debris_, she said, \"Charles,\r\nremove this.\" I was filled with admiration at her coolness, and\r\ndevoutly thankful that we Americans maintained an equally dignified\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nAt a grand reception given in our honor by the National Central\r\nCommittee, in Princess' Hall, Mr. Jacob Bright, M. P., presided and\r\nmade an admirable opening speech, followed by his sister, Mrs.\r\nMcLaren, with a highly complimentary address of welcome. By\r\nparticular request Miss Anthony gave a presentation of the\r\nindustrial, legal and political status of American women; while I\r\nset forth their educational, social and religious limitations. Mr.\r\nJohn P. Thomasson, M. P., made the closing address, expressing his\r\nsatisfaction with the addresses of the ladies and the progress made\r\nin both countries.[582]\r\n\r\nMrs. Thomasson, daughter of Mrs. Lucas, gave several delightful\r\nevening parties,[583] receptions and dinners, some for ladies\r\nalone, where an abundant opportunity was offered for a critical\r\nanalysis of the idiosyncracies of the superior sex, especially in\r\ntheir political dealings with women. The patience of even such\r\nheroic souls as Lydia Becker and Caroline Biggs was almost\r\nexhausted with the tergiversations of members of the House of\r\nCommons. Alas for the many fair promises broken, the hopes\r\ndeferred, the votes fully relied on and counted, all missing in the\r\nhour of action. One crack of Mr. Gladstone's whip put a hundred\r\nLiberals to flight in a twinkling, members whom these noble women\r\nhad spent years in educating. I never visited the House of Commons\r\nthat I did not see Miss Becker and Miss Biggs trying to elucidate\r\nthe fundamental principles of just government to some of them.\r\nVerily their divine faith and patience merited more worthy action\r\non the part of their representatives.\r\n\r\nWe formed very pleasant friendships with Miss Frances Lord and Miss\r\nHenrietta Mueller, spending several days with the latter at 58\r\nCadogan square, and both alike visited us at different times in\r\nBasingstoke. Miss Lord has translated some of Ibsen's plays very\r\ncreditably to herself, and, we understand, to the satisfaction of\r\nthe Swedish poet. Miss Lord is a cultured, charming woman,\r\nattractive in society, and has a rare gift in conversation; she is\r\nrather shrinking in her feelings. Miss Mueller, her devoted friend,\r\nis just the opposite; fearless, aggressive and self-centered. Miss\r\nLord discharged her duties as poor-law guardian faithfully, and\r\nMiss Mueller, as member of the London school-board, claimed her\r\nrights when infringed upon, and maintained the dignity of her\r\nposition with a good degree of tact and heroism. We met Miss\r\nWhitehead, another poor-law guardian, at Miss Mueller's, and had a\r\nlong talk on the sad condition of the London poor and the grand\r\nwork Octavia Hill had done among them. Miss Mueller read us a paper\r\non the dignity and office of single women. Her idea seems to be\r\nvery much like that expressed by St. Paul in his epistles, that it\r\nis better for those who have a genius for public work in the church\r\nor State not to marry; and Miss Mueller carries her theory into\r\npractice thus far. She has a luxurious establishment of her own, is\r\nfully occupied in politics and reform, and though she lives by\r\nherself she entertains her friends generously, and does whatever it\r\nseems good to her to do. As she is bright and entertaining and has\r\nmany worshipers, she may fall a victim to the usual fate in spite\r\nof her admirable essay, which has been printed in tract form and\r\ncirculated extensively in England and America. Miss Mueller gave\r\nMiss Anthony and myself a farewell reception on the eve of our\r\ndeparture for America, when we had the opportunity of meeting once\r\nmore most of the pleasant acquaintances we had made in London.\r\nAlthough it was announced for the afternoon, we did in fact receive\r\nall day as many as could not come at the hour appointed. Dr.\r\nElizabeth Blackwell took breakfast with us; Mrs. Fawcett, Mrs.\r\nSeville[584] and Miss Lord were with us at luncheon; Harriet Hosmer\r\nand Olive Logan soon after; Mrs. Peter Taylor later, and from three\r\nto six o'clock the parlors were crowded.\r\n\r\nReturning from London I passed my birthday, November 12, in\r\nBasingstoke. It was a sad day to us all, knowing that it was the\r\nlast before my departure for America. When I imprinted the farewell\r\nkiss on the soft cheek of little Nora in the cradle, she in the\r\ndawn and I in the sunset of life, I realized how widely the long\r\nyears and the broad ocean would separate us forever. Miss Anthony,\r\nwho had been visiting Mrs. Parker, near Warrington, met me at\r\nAlderly Edge, where we spent a few days in the charming home of Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Jacob Bright. There we found their noble sisters, Mrs.\r\nMcLaren and Mrs. Lucas, young Walter McLaren and his lovely bride,\r\nEva Mueller, whom we had heard several times on the suffrage\r\nplatform. We rallied her on the step she had lately taken,\r\nnotwithstanding her sister's able paper on the blessedness of a\r\nsingle life. While here we visited Dean Stanley's birthplace; but\r\non his death the light and joy went out, and the atmosphere of the\r\nold church whose walls had once echoed to his voice, and the house\r\nwhere he had spent so many useful years, seemed sad and deserted.\r\nBut the day was bright and warm, the scenery all around was\r\nbeautiful, cows and sheep were still grazing in the meadows, the\r\ngrass as green as in June. This is England's chief charm, forever\r\ngreen, some compensation for the many cloudy days. An evening\r\nreception in Mrs. Bright's spacious parlors, with friends from\r\nManchester and other adjoining towns, with speeches of welcome and\r\nfarewell, finished our visit at Alderly Edge.\r\n\r\nAs our good friends Mrs. McLaren and Mrs. Lucas had determined to\r\nsee us safely on board the Servia, they escorted us to Liverpool,\r\nwhere we met Mrs. Margaret Parker, Mrs. Scatcherd and Dr. Fanny\r\nDickinson of Chicago. Another reception was given us at the\r\nresidence of Dr. Ewing Whittle. Several short speeches were\r\nmade, all cheering the parting guests with words of hope and\r\nencouragement for the good cause.\r\n\r\nHere the wisdom of forming an international association was\r\nconsidered. The proposition met with such favor from those present\r\nthat a committee was appointed to correspond with the friends in\r\ndifferent nations. As Miss Anthony and myself are members of that\r\ncommittee,[585] now that these volumes are finished and we are at\r\nliberty once more, we shall ascertain as soon as possible the\r\nfeasibility of a grand international conference in New York in\r\n1888, to celebrate the fourth decade of our movement for woman's\r\nenfranchisement. Such conventions have been held by the friends of\r\nanti-slavery, peace, temperance, social purity and evangelical\r\nchristianity, and why may not the suffrage cause, too, receive a\r\nnew impetus from the united efforts of its friends in all\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nOn the broad Atlantic for ten days we had many opportunities to\r\nreview all we had seen and heard. There we met our noble friends,\r\nMr. and Mrs. Hussey of New Jersey; also Mrs. Margaret Buchanan\r\nSullivan of Chicago, just returning from an extended tour in\r\nIreland, who gave us many of her rich experiences. Sitting on deck\r\nhour after hour, how often I queried with myself as to the\r\nsignificance of the boon for which women were so earnestly\r\nstruggling. In asking for a voice in the government under which we\r\nlive, have we been pursuing a shadow for forty years? In seeking\r\npolitical power, are we abdicating that social throne where they\r\ntell us our influence is unbounded? No! no! the right of suffrage\r\nis no shadow, but a substantial entity that the citizen can seize\r\nand hold for his own protection and his country's welfare. A direct\r\npower over one's own person and property, an individual opinion to\r\nbe counted on all questions of public interest, is better than\r\nindirect influence, be it ever so far-reaching.\r\n\r\nThough influence, like the pure white light, is all-pervading, yet\r\nit is oft-times obscured with passing clouds and nights of\r\ndarkness; like the sun's rays, it may be healthy, genial,\r\ninspiring, though sometimes too direct for comfort, too oblique for\r\nwarmth, too scattered for any given purpose. But as the prism by\r\ndividing the rays of light reveals to us the brilliant coloring of\r\nthe atmosphere, and as the burning-glass by concentrating them in a\r\nfocus intensifies their heat, so does the right of suffrage reveal\r\nthe beauty and power of individual sovereignty in the great drama\r\nof national life, while on a vital measure of public interest it\r\ncombines the many voices of the people in a grand chorus of protest\r\nor applause.\r\n\r\nAfter an unusually calm, pleasant voyage, for November, we sailed\r\nup our beautiful New York harbor just as the sun was rising in all\r\nhis glory, gilding every hill-top and distant spire in the\r\nlandscape, and with grateful hearts we celebrated the national\r\nThanksgiving-day once more with loving friends in the great\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[575] He asked me confidentially if I knew what the \"D\" in his name\r\nstood for. \"Why,\" said I, \"in line with your profession, it must be\r\nfor 'Divinity,' or 'Doxology.'\" \"No,\" said he, \"for 'Dynamite.'\" As\r\nwe were being blown up just then in all parts of London, I begged\r\nhim not to explode until Sunday morning in old South Church, as I\r\nwould rather see a wreck of the old theologies than of our charming\r\nhostess and Corney Green, who were giving us this pleasant\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\n[576] She says she prefers to be known as the wife of Duncan\r\nMcLaren, a member of parliament from Edinburgh for sixteen years,\r\nwho always voted right on the woman question, while John Bright is\r\nopposed to the movement.\r\n\r\n[577] She occupies the home of an English woman who has taken her\r\nseven children to Germany for their education. How strange it is\r\nthat so many parents imagine that they can educate their children\r\nbetter in a foreign land.\r\n\r\n[578] After dinner, while the gentlemen still lingered at the\r\ntable, the ladies being alone, an unusual amount of heresy as to\r\nthe rights of \"the divinely appointed head of the house\" found\r\nexpression. A young English-woman, who had been brought up in great\r\nretirement, turned to me and said, \"I never heard such declarations\r\nbefore; do you ladies all really believe that God intended men and\r\nwomen to be equal, and do you really feel that girls have a right\r\nto enjoy as many privileges as boys?\" In chorus we all promptly\r\nsaid, \"We do,\" and I added, \"If you will recall all the events of\r\nyour life thus far, and your own feelings at times, you will find\r\nthat again and again your own heart has protested against the\r\ninjustice to which you have been subjected. Now,\" said I, \"think a\r\nlittle, and see if you can recall no sense of dissatisfaction at\r\nthe broad difference made between your sisters and brothers.\"\r\n\"Well,\" said she, \"I did often wonder why father gave the boys half\r\na crown a week for spending money, and us girls a few pence; why so\r\nmuch thought and money were expended on their education, and so\r\nlittle on ours; but as I saw that that was the custom everywhere, I\r\ncame to the conclusion that they were a superior order of beings,\r\nand so thought no more about it, and I never heard that theory\r\ncontradicted until this evening.\"\r\n\r\n[579] Among these were Mr. and Mrs. Haslam, Mr. Wigham, brother of\r\nEliza Wigham, and his cultured wife; Hannah Webb, the daughter of\r\nRichard, and Thomas Webb and daughters, in whose old family-record\r\nbook of visitors she was shown the autographs of William Lloyd\r\nGarrison and Nathaniel P. Rogers over the date of 1840.\r\n\r\n[580] On one occasion I counted fourteen: Miss Risley Seward, Mrs.\r\nLouise Chandler Moulton, Mrs. Laura Curtis Bullard, Miss Rachel\r\nFoster, Mrs. William Mellen and two sons and daughters, Mr.\r\nTheodore Tilton. Miss Anthony, Mrs. Stanton Blatch and myself.\r\n\r\n[581] Aside from those already mentioned were William Henry\r\nChanning, L. N. Fowler, the phrenologist, and his daughter; Mrs.\r\nLouise Chandler Moulton, Mrs. Stanton, Mrs. Stanton Blatch, Miss\r\nAnthony, Mrs. Powell, Mrs. Wilson, Mrs. Phillips, several members\r\nfrom the Bright, the McLaren and the Cobden families, Mrs. Conway,\r\nMiss Emily Faithful, Mr. William Henry Blatch, Mr. Stark, the\r\nartist; Philip Marston, the blind poet; Miss Orme and Miss\r\nRichardson, attorneys-at-law; Judge Kelley, wife and daughter\r\nFlorence, Miss Lydia Becker, Miss Caroline Biggs and sisters, Miss\r\nJulia Osgood.\r\n\r\n[582] Among the distinguished persons on the platform were Frances\r\nPower Cobbe, Dr. Garrett Anderson, Mrs. Fawcett, Mrs. Jacob Bright,\r\nMrs. Lucas, Mrs. Thomasson, Mrs. Margaret Parker, Mrs. Alice\r\nScatcherd, Miss Becker, Miss Biggs, Mrs. Moore, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nConway, Oscar Wilde and his queenly mother, Charles McLaren, M. P.,\r\nMrs. Peter A. Taylor, Miss Helen Taylor, Miss Orme, Miss Mueller,\r\nMiss Lord, Miss Foster, Mrs. and Miss Blatch, Mrs. Mellen, Miss Tod\r\nof Belfast, Mrs. Chesson, daughter of George Thompson, the great\r\nanti-slavery orator, and very many others whose names we cannot\r\nrecall.\r\n\r\n[583] Where we met Mrs. Fawcett, Dr. Garrett Anderson, Sir Hugh\r\nStaples, Mr. Mitchell, the Misses Stackpole and brothers, Madame\r\nVenturi, Miss Biggs and sisters, Miss Frances Lord and her sister,\r\nwho is doing a noble work in her kindergarten.\r\n\r\n[584] Mrs. Seville, whose husband was a professor at Sandhurst\r\nCollege, having recently awoke to the indignities the church heaps\r\nupon women, made her protest in discarding her bonnet and appearing\r\non Sundays with her head uncovered, contrary to Paul's injunctions.\r\nHaving thus attended church for two years, involving much criticism\r\nand disturbance, both the vicar and the bishop labored with her to\r\nresume the bonnet, but she remained incorrigible. She read us a\r\nletter of remonstrance from the bishop, over which we all had a\r\nhearty laugh.\r\n\r\n[585] The following is the report of the action prepared that\r\nevening by Mrs. Parker: \"At a large and influential gathering of\r\nthe friends of woman suffrage, at Parliament Terrace, Liverpool,\r\nNovember 16, 1883, convened by E.

What is meant by the\r\nproposition as generally used is, that the State is politically an\r\naggregate of families and not of individuals. This is entirely\r\nuntrue, and if true the fact would be calamitous. Civil government\r\nis supposed to have had its origin in family government, the\r\npatriarch becoming chief of a tribe which was substantially the\r\noutgrowth and expansion of a single family; but if a nation was to\r\nbe formed of such tribes it would be essential to its peace and\r\nprosperity that they should as soon as possible mingle into one\r\nhomogeneous mass, and that no citizen should consider himself of\r\none tribe rather than another. It is the family idea in a\r\ngovernment like ours that makes the feuds which are handed down\r\nfrom generation to generation in some parts of the country. It made\r\nthe frequent bloody contests of the clans in Scotland, and the\r\ndissensions of the Hebrew tribes. In a republic nothing can be more\r\ndisastrous than that great political leaders should have large\r\nfamily followings. The first duty of the citizen is to forget that\r\nhe belongs to any family in particular. He is an individual citizen\r\nof the State, and when he becomes a magistrate he must practically\r\nignore the fact that he has family relatives who feel entitled to\r\nhis special favor. He must, like justice, be blind to every fact\r\nexcept that the applicant for office or for justice is an\r\nindividual citizen and must stand wholly on his personal merits or\r\nthe justice of his cause.\r\n\r\nThe proposition that the family is the basis of the State thus\r\ntaken by itself is entirely false; but even if true, the use made\r\nof it as an argument against giving suffrage to women is equally\r\nfallacious. This can be shown by a single illustration. We will\r\nsuppose there are two families, in both of which the father dies,\r\nleaving in one case a widow and one son, and in the other a widow\r\nand six daughters. Where is now the family representation? The son\r\nwhom we will suppose to be of age, goes to the polls and we will\r\nsuppose sufficiently represents the family to which he belongs; but\r\nwhere is the family representation for the other widow and her six\r\ndaughters? She may be the largest tax-payer in the State, and yet\r\nshe can have no voice in determining what taxes shall be laid, nor\r\nto what purposes the money shall be appropriated.\r\n\r\nThe question whether the family is the basis of the State cannot be\r\nmade an abstract question of political philosophy. Indeed the\r\nquestion is unmeaning when put as an abstract one. We might just as\r\nwell ask, \"Is the climate cold in a State?\" or, \"Is the English\r\nlanguage spoken in a State?\" It is only as we ask these questions\r\nabout a _particular_ State that they have any meaning. \"Is it cold\r\nin Russia?\" \"Is English spoken in Connecticut?\"\r\n\r\nTake the case of a State ruled by a despot. Here the people are not\r\nthe political basis of the State, either as families or as\r\nindividuals. They have no political power whatever. The political\r\nbasis of the State is the will of the despot. He is himself and\r\nalone the State politically. He makes the laws himself, and shoots\r\nand hangs those who disobey them. The people are indispensable to\r\nthe State, and so in one sense its basis, just as the square miles\r\nthat compose its territory are its physical basis, but the people\r\nstand in no political relation whatever to the State, any more than\r\nthe rocks and gravel of its territory. It is only where the people\r\nof the State have the whole or a part of its political power, that\r\nthe question can possibly arise as to whether individuals or\r\nfamilies are its political basis. And when it thus arises, it comes\r\nup wholly with reference to a particular State, and not as an\r\nabstract question. And then it is wholly a question of fact, not\r\none of political philosophy; a matter for simple ascertainment, not\r\nfor speculation and reasoning. Thus, suppose the question to be,\r\n\"Is the family or the individual the political basis of the State\r\nof Connecticut?\" We are to answer the question solely by looking at\r\nthe constitution and laws of the State. We look there and find that\r\nit is as clear as language can make it that the political basis of\r\nthe State is the individual and not the family. The individual is\r\nmade the voter--not the family--and that is the whole question. It\r\nwas perfectly easy for the people, if they had so desired, when\r\nthey were adopting a constitution, to make families and not\r\nindividuals the depositaries of political power, but they chose to\r\ngive the power to individuals, and thus the question is absolutely\r\nsettled for the State. It is true, the State does not carry out\r\ncompletely its own theory, but this was its theory, and what it did\r\nwas wholly in this direction and away from the family theory. We go\r\nto the constitution of the State to settle this question, just as\r\nwe would to settle the question whether the governor's term is one\r\nyear or two, or whether the judges hold office for a term of years\r\nor for life. While considering whether either of these provisions\r\nought to be adopted, we are dealing with a matter proper for\r\nopinions and argument, but when the provisions have been adopted,\r\nthe whole question becomes one of fact, and we look only to the\r\nconstitution to determine it, and treat it as a matter not for\r\ndiscussion but for absolute ascertainment.\r\n\r\nWhen one is advocating the theory that the family should be the\r\npolitical basis of the State, he is simply saying that the\r\nconstitution ought to be amended and the right of voting taken away\r\nfrom individuals and given to families. But it is idle to urge\r\nthis. Such a measure would not get even a respectable minority\r\nof votes. It is decisive on this point that not a single\r\nrepresentative government, so far as the writer knows, has adopted\r\nthe theory that the family and not the individual should vote. A\r\nlaw peculiar to Russia gives its villages, in the management of\r\ntheir local matters, the right of voting by families--a perfect\r\nillustration, on a very small scale, of the family as the political\r\nbasis of a State. But here woman suffrage is admitted as a\r\nnecessary result; and where there is no man to represent the\r\nfamily, or he is unable to attend, the woman of the house casts the\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of woman suffrage have no interest whatever in this\r\nquestion, as it is idle to suppose that it can become a practical\r\none. The writer has taken what trouble he has in the matter solely\r\nin the interest of correct thinking.\r\n\r\n_Hartford, May, 1879._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK.\r\n\r\n     _Brief on the Legislature's Power to Extend the Suffrage,\r\n     Submitted February 19, 1880, to the Judiciary Committee of the\r\n     Assembly of the State of New York._\r\n\r\nBY HAMILTON WILCOX.\r\n\r\nI. LEGISLATURE OMNIPOTENT.--Unlike the Federal constitution, the\r\nState constitution does not reserve all powers not expressly\r\ndelegated. It is held by the authorities that in the absence of\r\npositive restriction the legislature is omnipotent.\r\n\r\n\"In a judicial sense, their authority is absolute and unlimited,\r\nexcept by the express restrictions of the fundamental law\" (Court\r\nof Appeals, 1863, Bank of Chenango vs. Brown, 26 N. Y., 467; S. P.,\r\nCathcart vs. Fire Department of New York, Id., 529; Supreme Court,\r\n1864, Clark vs. Miller, 42 Barb., 255; Luke vs. City of Brooklyn,\r\n43 Id., 54).\r\n\r\n\"Only on the ground of express constitutional provisions limiting\r\nlegislative power, can courts declare void any legislative\r\nenactment\" (Court of Error. 1838, Cochran vs. Van Surlay, 29 Wend.,\r\n365; Newell vs. People, 7 N. Y. [3 Seld.], 9, 109).\r\n\r\n\"Before proceeding to amend, by judicial sentence, what has been\r\nenacted by the law-making power, it should clearly appear that the\r\nact cannot be supported by any reasonable intendment or allowable\r\npresumption\" (Court of Appeals, 1858, People vs. Supervisors of\r\nOrange, 17 N. Y., 235; affi'g, 27 Barb., 575).\r\n\r\nII. POWERS UNDEFINED.--The constitution forbids the legislature to\r\ndo certain things. Otherwise it does not define or limit the\r\nlegislature's powers (Art. 3, Sec.Sec. 3, 18, 19, 24).\r\n\r\nIII. NO PROHIBITION.--No constitution of New York has ever\r\nforbidden the legislature to extend the suffrage beyond the\r\nclasses specified by such constitution; nor has any ever forbidden\r\nunspecified persons to vote. The constitution simply secures the\r\nsuffrage to certain classes, and there leaves the matter.\r\n\r\nIV. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.--The constitution declares that the\r\nobject of its establishment is to secure the blessings of freedom\r\nto the people (Preamble, Revised Statutes, vol. 1., p. 82). Hence\r\nit, and all enactments under it, must be understood and construed,\r\nwhere a contrary intent is not clearly expressed, to be aimed at\r\nsecuring freedom to all.\r\n\r\nV. DISFRANCHISEMENT.--The constitution follows this declaration by\r\nlaying down at its outset, as its fundamental principle, that \"No\r\nmember of this State shall be disfranchised or deprived of any of\r\nthe rights or privileges secured to any citizens thereof, except by\r\nthe law of the land\" (Art. 1, Sec. 1, do., do.). Disfranchisement,\r\nthen, must be express by the law. It cannot constitutionally be\r\ninflicted through mere implication or silence.\r\n\r\nRules for the securing of freedom have often been found to cover\r\nunforeseen cases. Such was the fact in the famous decision of Lord\r\nMansfield in 1774, that slavery was against the common law, under\r\nwhich slavery was afterward abolished throughout the British\r\nempire; and the decision of the highest court of Massachusetts,\r\nthat the terms of the constitution of 1780 conferred freedom on the\r\nslaves of that State.\r\n\r\nWomen, it is now fully recognized, are citizens, and hence \"members\r\nof the State,\" entitled to the security guaranteed. The _practice_\r\nunder the constitution has been to treat as _disfranchised_ all\r\npersons _not specified_ as entitled to vote. Though this practice\r\nis plainly against the declared object and principle of the\r\nconstitution, it has been general and mostly continuous, and has\r\nthus acquired the force of law. This, however, does not impair the\r\nlegislature's power to correct the practice by express enactment.\r\n\r\nVI. PRECEDENTS.--The legislature _has_ repeatedly corrected this\r\npractice by express enactments securing freedom to various portions\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n(_a_). CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION, 1801.--The act calling this\r\nconvention extended the suffrage for members of that body--_the\r\nhighest officers of the State_--to \"all free male citizens over\r\ntwenty-one years of age,\" while the constitution secured suffrage\r\nonly to male holders of and actual taxpayers on a fixed amount of\r\nreal estate (Session Law 1801, ch. 69, p. 151; constitution of\r\n1777, do., 1, 39).\r\n\r\n(_b_). CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION, 1821.--The act providing for the\r\nconvention that framed the constitution of 1822, while the existing\r\nconstitution (as above) only specified as entitled to vote, holders\r\nof and taxpayers on a fixed amount of real estate--this act allowed\r\n_all_ freeholders, however small the value of their holdings, all\r\nactual taxpayers, all officers and privates, ex-officers and\r\nex-privates, in militia or in volunteer or uniform corps, all\r\npersons exempt by law from taxation or militia duty, all workers on\r\npublic roads and highways, or payers of commutation for such work;\r\nto vote on the question whether the convention should be held, to\r\nvote in the choice of delegates thereto--_again for the highest\r\nofficers of the State_--and to vote on the question of adoption of\r\nthe new constitution--_to exercise a voice in framing the State's\r\nfundamental law_. The council of revision, including the governor,\r\nwhich opposed and defeated part of this act, made no objection to\r\nthis feature (Session Laws 1821, ch. 90, p. 83).\r\n\r\nThe vote for governor, 1820, was 93,437--the largest ever cast in\r\nthe State. That on the question of calling the convention in 1821\r\nwas 144,247. One act of the legislature thus enfranchised _fifty\r\nthousand persons_. The vote on the new constitution stood: For,\r\n74,732; against, 41,402; majority for, 33,330. Thus the votes of\r\nfifty thousand persons--enfranchised, not by the constitution but\r\nby the legislature--carried the adoption of a new constitution,\r\nwhich further secured to them the freedom which the legislature had\r\nopened to them. The vote for governor in 1824--the next\r\nhotly-contested election--was 190,545; so that the immediate effect\r\nof the legislature's act was to add 97,108 persons to the\r\nconstituency--to make a mass of new voters who outnumbered those\r\nspecified by the constitution.\r\n\r\n(_c_). ALIENS VOTING.--The constitution specifies none but\r\n\"citizens\" as entitled to vote; yet the legislature, by a school\r\nlaw of many years' standing, allowed _aliens_ to vote for school\r\nfunctionaries, on filing with the secretary of state notice of\r\nintention to become naturalized (1 R. S., art. 2, Sec. 1, p. 65; 2 R.\r\nS., 63, Sec. 12; 2 R. S., 1,096, Sec. 31).\r\n\r\n(_d_). NORTHFIELD.--The proprietors of swamp-lands in the town of\r\nNorthfield, Richmond county, were authorized to elect directors of\r\ndrainage, without any restriction or qualification but ownership\r\n(Session Laws 1862, ch. 80, Sec. 2, p. 233).\r\n\r\n(_e_). The taxpayers of Newport, Herkimer county, were authorized\r\nto vote on the question of issuing bonds to raise money for a\r\ntown-house. Under this law women who were taxpayers voted (Act\r\nApril 9, 1873, Session Laws, ch. 187, Sec. 3, p. 304).\r\n\r\n(_f_). The taxpayers of Dansville, Livingston county, were\r\nauthorized to vote on the issue of water-bonds. Under this act\r\nwomen voted (Act April 24, 1873, Session Laws, ch. 285, Sec. 4, p.\r\n409).\r\n\r\n(_g_). The taxpayers of Saratoga Springs were authorized to vote on\r\nthe question of issuing bonds for the construction of an additional\r\nwater-main. Under this ninety-nine women voted (Act May 13, 1876,\r\nSession Laws, ch. 254, Sec. 4, p. 250).\r\n\r\nVII. SCHOOL SUFFRAGE.--If the legislature can admit aliens to vote\r\nat school-meetings, it can admit female citizens to do so.\r\n\r\nVIII. PRESIDENTIAL SUFFRAGE.--1. The federal constitution provides\r\nthat electors of president and vice-president shall be appointed\r\n\"in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct\" (Art. 2, Sec.\r\n2).\r\n\r\n2. It also provides that \"this constitution shall be the supreme\r\nlaw of the land, and the judges in every State shall be bound\r\nthereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding\" (Art. 6, Sec. 2).\r\n\r\n3. The legislature has the power under the federal constitution to\r\nprovide whatever method it may choose for the appointment of the\r\nelectors. The courts have no power to interfere, and even an\r\nexecutive veto would have no force. The legislature has sole and\r\nfull power to say who may vote for electors and how the election\r\nshall be held.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\nBY CARRIE S. BURNHAM.\r\n\r\nThe common law of England as modified by English statutes prior to\r\nthe Revolution has been formally adopted either by constitutions\r\nand statutes or assumed by courts of justice as the law of the land\r\nin every State save Louisiana, and in the absence of positive\r\nstatutes is the common law of the United States. To understand the\r\nlegal status of woman in Pennsylvania it is therefore necessary,\r\n_First_--To ascertain her condition under the common law;\r\n_Second_--How this law has been modified in this State by statutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON LAW.\r\n\r\nBy the common law, which Lord Coke calls \"the perfection of\r\nreason,\" women arrive at the age of discretion at twelve, men at\r\nfourteen; both sexes are of full age at twenty-one, entitled to\r\ncivil rights, and if unmarried and possessed of freehold, they are\r\nequally entitled to the exercise of political rights (Blackstone,\r\nI., 463; IV., 212; Bouvier's Institutes, 156, 157; Decisions of\r\nEnglish courts in 1612, quoted in 7 Mod. Rep., 264).\r\n\r\n\"By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law\"; that is,\r\nthe legal existence of the woman is \"merged in that of her\r\nhusband.\" He is her \"baron,\" or \"lord,\" bound to supply her with\r\nshelter, food, clothing and medicine, and is entitled to her\r\nearnings--the use and custody of her person, which he may seize\r\nwherever he may find it (Blackstone, I., 442, 443; Coke Litt., 112\r\na, 187 b; 8 Dowl., P. C., 632.)\r\n\r\nThe husband being bound to provide for his wife the necessaries of\r\nlife, and being responsible for \"her morals\" and the good order of\r\nthe household, may choose and govern the domicil, choose her\r\nassociates, separate her from her relatives, restrain her religious\r\nand personal freedom, compel her to cohabit with him, correct her\r\nfaults by mild means and, if necessary, chastise her with\r\nmoderation, as though she was his apprentice or child. This is in\r\n\"respect to the terms of the marriage contract and the infirmity of\r\nthe sex\" (Bl., I., 444; 1 Bishop on Mar. and Div., 758; 8 Dowl. P.\r\nC., 632; Bouv. Insts., 277, 278, 2,283; 1 Wend. Bl., 442, note; 4\r\nPetersdorf's A. B., 21, note).\r\n\r\nWoman's character, exposed to the vilest slanders of \"malignity and\r\nfalsehood,\" and her chastity are protected on account of the injury\r\nsustained by the father, husband or master from loss of her\r\nservices, or wrongful entry of his house, rather than the injury\r\ndone to her as an individual (Bl. I., 445, note; III., 141, 143,\r\nnote; 3 Serg. and Rawle, Penn., 36; 3 Penn., 49; 2 Watts' Penn.,\r\n474).\r\n\r\nThe husband is entitled to recover damages for \"criminal\r\nconversation with his wife,\" or for injury to her person whereby he\r\nis deprived of his \"marital rights,\" or of her \"company and\r\nassistance\"; also an action of _trespass vi et armis_ against the\r\nindividual enticing her away or encouraging her to live separately\r\nfrom him; the offense implies force and constraint, \"the wife\r\nhaving no power to consent,\" and is punishable with fine and\r\nimprisonment (Bl., III., 139; 2 Inst., 434; Bouvier's Institutes,\r\n3,495).\r\n\r\nThe wife has no action for injuries to her husband as she is not\r\nentitled to his services, neither has she any separate interest in\r\nanything during her coverture. The law takes notice only of the\r\ninjuries done to the \"superior of the parties related\"; because\r\n\"the inferior has no kind of property in the company, care or\r\nassistance of the superior, as the superior is held to have in\r\nthose of the inferior\" (Blackstone, III., 143; Bouv. Insts.,\r\n3,495).\r\n\r\nThe husband, by marriage, becomes entitled absolutely to the\r\npersonal property of his wife, which at his death goes to his\r\nrepresentatives; also to the rents and profits of her lands, to the\r\ninterest in her chattels real and _choses_ in action, of which he\r\ncan dispose at pleasure, except by will. He acquires the same right\r\nin any property whether real or personal of which she may become\r\npossessed after marriage, and is liable during coverture for her\r\ndebts contracted before marriage (Bl., II., 434, 435; Bouv. Insts.,\r\n4,005; Coke Litt., 46, 351).\r\n\r\nAt his death she becomes possessed of her wardrobe and jewels, such\r\nof her chattels as remain undisposed of, and her own real estate;\r\nalso quarantine (_i. e._, forty days' residence in \"his mansion\"),\r\none-third of his personality absolutely and the use of one-third of\r\nany real estate of which he is possessed during coverture for the\r\nterm of her natural life. _His_ mansion, realty and personalty\r\nincludes what they have jointly earned as well as that of which he\r\nwas possessed at marriage. The widow's right to one-third of the\r\npersonal estate was abolished by English statutes prior to the\r\nRevolution, but has since been revived by Pennsylvania statutes\r\n(Blackstone, II., 129, 134, 139, 436, 492, 493; Coke Litt., 31, 34;\r\nBouvier's Institutes, 1,750; Brightley's Purdon, 806, 2 and 3).\r\n\r\nAt the death of the wife their joint earnings, also her chattels\r\nreal, vest absolutely in the husband, and if they have had a living\r\nchild the husband, as \"tenant by the curtesy,\" becomes possessed of\r\nher entire real estate for life. The wife loses her dower by\r\nadultery, but the husband does not lose his curtesy on that\r\naccount. Her dower is also barred by his treason and by a divorce\r\ngrounded on his adultery (Blackstone, II., 127, 434; Roper, Husband\r\nand Wife, 1,210; 2 Kent, 131; 7 Watts, 563; Bouvier's Institutes,\r\n1,732).\r\n\r\nA husband cannot convey real estate directly to his wife, but may\r\nthrough a trustee; neither can he give \"anything to her nor\r\ncovenant with her, for the grant would be to suppose her separate\r\nexistence, and to covenant with her would be to covenant with\r\nhimself.\" Their covenants or indebtedness to each other before\r\nmarriage are by the marriage extinguished (Blackstone, I., 442;\r\nCoke Litt., 3, 30; 112 a; 187 b; Connyn. Dig. Baron and Feme, D).\r\n\r\nThe husband may devise any property to his wife, but the wife\r\ncannot make a will, the law supposing her to be under his coercion;\r\nneither can she bind her person or property, nor make nor enforce a\r\ncontract, nor can she be a witness in any matter in which her\r\nhusband is interested (Blackstone, II., 293, 498, 444; 2 Kent, 179;\r\nBouv. Insts., 1,441; Connyn. Dig. Pleader, 2 A, 1; Baron and Feme,\r\nW; 2 Roper, Husband and Wife, 171).\r\n\r\nA wife, with the consent of her husband, may act as his or other's\r\nattorney, may be a guardian, trustee, administratrix or executrix,\r\nbut cannot sue in _auter droit_ unless her husband join in the\r\nsuit. This incapacitates her to act independently in either\r\ncapacity (Blackstone, II., 503; 1 Anders., 117; 2 Story, Eq.\r\nJuris., 1,367, note; 57 Penn. St. Rep., 356).\r\n\r\nA wife cannot enforce her rights nor defend any action brought\r\nagainst her, but must plead coverture in person, being incapable of\r\nappointing an attorney (Bouv. Insts., 2,787, 2,907; 41 N. H., 106;\r\n2 Saund., 209; c. n. 1).\r\n\r\nWhen a woman marries after having commenced a suit, the suit\r\nabates; but the husband may _in equity_ sue her for his marital\r\nrights in her property; marriage of a female partner dissolves the\r\npartnership (Bouv. Insts., 4,037, 1,494; 4 Russ. Ch., 247; 3 Atk.\r\nCh., 478; 2 P. Will Ch., 243).\r\n\r\nThe father of legitimate children is bound for their maintenance\r\nand education, is entitled to their labor and custody and has power\r\nto dispose of them until twenty-one years of age, by deed or\r\nlegacy, even though they are unborn at his death. The testamentary\r\nguardian's right to their custody supersedes that of their mother\r\n(Bl., I., 447, 451, 453; 2 Kent, 191 and 193; Bouv. Insts., 344; 5\r\nRawle, 323; 2 Watts, 406; 5 East, 221; Purd. Dig., New Ed., 411,\r\n29; 5 Pitts, L. J., 406; 1 Pitts, 412).\r\n\r\n\"A mother is entitled to no power, but to reverence and respect,\r\nfrom her children\"; she has no legal authority over them nor right\r\nto their services, but her property is liable for their maintenance\r\nif the father has not an estate. The mother's appointment of a\r\ntestamentary guardian is absolutely void (Bl., I., 453 and 461,\r\nnote by Chitty; Vaughan, 180; 1 Leg. Gaz. R., 56).\r\n\r\nThe mother of a \"natural or illegitimate\" child is its natural\r\nguardian, entitled to its control and custody and her settlement is\r\nits domicil (Bl., I., 459; 2 Kent, 216; 5 Term Rep., 278; Newton\r\nvs. Braintree, 14 Mass., 382).\r\n\r\n\"Intestate personal property is divided equally between males and\r\nfemales, but a son, though younger than all his sisters, is the\r\nheir to the whole of real property\" (Bl., I., 444, note by\r\nChristian).\r\n\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA STATUTES AND COURT DECISIONS.\r\n\r\nThis \"perfection of reason\" (the common law) has been changed in\r\nPennsylvania in the following particulars:\r\n\r\nAll women, married and single, are deprived of political rights by\r\nthe use of the generic word \"freeman\" in the constitution (29 Legal\r\nIntelligencer, 5).\r\n\r\nHeir at common law is abolished by statute; however, the right to\r\nadminister vests in the male in preference to the female of the\r\nsame degree of consanguinity. Half-brothers are entitled to the\r\npreference over own sisters (Purdon, 410, 27; Single's Appeal, 59\r\nPenn. St. R., 55).\r\n\r\nAny property belonging to a woman before marriage, or which accrues\r\nto her during coverture by gift, bequest or purchase, continues, by\r\nthe act of April 11, 1848, to be her separate property after\r\nmarriage, and is not liable for the debts of her husband nor\r\nsubject to his disposal without her written consent, duly\r\nacknowledged before one of the judges of the Court of Common Pleas\r\nas voluntarily given; _provided_, that he is not liable for the\r\ndebts contracted before or after marriage, or for her torts\r\n(Purdon's Dig., 1,005, 13).\r\n\r\n\"This act protects the wife's interest in her separate property\r\nboth as to title and possession,\" but \"does not empower her to\r\nconvey her real estate by a deed in which her husband has not\r\njoined,\" nor \"create a lease without his concurrence,\" nor \"execute\r\nan obligation for the payment of money or the performance of any\r\nother act,\" nor in any way dispose of her property save by gift or\r\nloan to him; she may bind her separate estate for his debts, and in\r\nsecurity for the loan she may take a judgment or mortgage against\r\nthe estate of the husband in the name of a third person, who shall\r\nact as her trustee (18 Penn. St. R., 506, 582; 21, 402; 1 Gr., 402;\r\n6 Phila., 531; Pur. Dig., 1,007, 21).\r\n\r\nThe husband is the natural guardian or trustee of the property of\r\nthe wife; but by application \"to the Court of Common Pleas of the\r\ncounty where she was domiciled at the time of her marriage,\" the\r\ncourt will appoint a trustee (not her husband) to take charge of\r\nthe property secured to her by the act of 1848. This act, however,\r\ndoes not authorize the appointment of a trustee, to the exclusion\r\nof her husband, of property owned by her prior to the passage of\r\nthe act, nor was it intended to affect vested rights of husbands\r\nand does not protect them for the wife's benefit against the claims\r\nof creditors (10 Penn. St. Rep., 398 and 505; 18, 392 and 509; 21,\r\n260; 1 Jones, 272).\r\n\r\nIn a clear case the wife's real estate cannot be levied upon and\r\nsold by a creditor of the husband, _but the burden of proof_ is\r\nupon her to show by evidence \"which does not admit of a reasonable\r\ndoubt,\" that she owned the property before marriage or acquired it\r\nsubsequently by gift, bequest, or paid for it with funds not\r\nfurnished by her husband nor the result of their joint earnings.\r\nThe wife's possession of money is no evidence of her title to it\r\n(18 Penn. St. Rep., 366; 7 Phila., 118).\r\n\r\nIf no property, or not sufficient property, of the husband can be\r\nfound, the separate property and goods of the wife may be levied\r\nupon and sold for rent or for debts incurred for the support of the\r\nfamily (Purd. Dig., 1,006, 15; 38 Penn. St. Rep., 344).\r\n\r\nA married woman's bond and warrant of attorney are absolutely void,\r\nnor can she make a valid contract except for a sewing-machine or\r\nfor the improvement of her separate property, and her bond given or\r\na judgment confessed by her for such debt is void (24 Penn. St.\r\nRep., 80; Act of 1872, Pur. Dig., 1,010).\r\n\r\nShe may sell and transfer shares of the capital stock of any\r\nrailroad company, but cannot herself or by attorney transfer\r\ncertificates of city loan (28 Leg. Int., 116; Act June 2, 1871).\r\n\r\nA married woman cannot enforce her rights against third persons,\r\neither for the performance of a contract or the recovery of her\r\nproperty, without her husband join in the suit, although the party\r\ncontracting with her is liable to an action (1 Gr., 21; Act of 1850\r\nand 1839; 6 Phila., 223).\r\n\r\nIf divorced or separated from her husband by his neglect or\r\ndesertion, she may protect her reputation by an action for slander\r\nand libel; but if her husband is the defendant, this suit, as also\r\nfor alimony and divorce, must be in the name of a \"next friend.\"\r\nShe is entitled to a writ of _habeas corpus_ if unlawfully\r\nrestrained of her liberty (Purd. Dig., 510, 12; 513, 24; 754, 1).\r\n\r\nThe wife of a drunkard or profligate man by petitioning the Court\r\nof Common Pleas, setting forth these facts and his desertion of her\r\nand neglect to provide for her and their children, may be entitled\r\nto the custody of her children, and, as a \"_feme sole trader_,\"\r\nempowered to transact business and acquire a separate property,\r\nwhich shall be subject to her own disposal during life, and liable\r\nfor the maintenance and education of her children. Her testimony\r\nmust be sustained \"by two respectable witnesses\" (Pur. Dig., 692,\r\n5; Act of 1855, 2; 2 Roper, Husband and Wife, 171, 173).\r\n\r\nBy act of April, 1872, any married woman having first petitioned\r\nthe court, stating under oath or affirmation her intention of\r\nclaiming her separate earnings, is entitled to acquire by her labor\r\na separate property which shall not be subject to any legal claim\r\nof her husband or of his creditors, she, however, being compelled\r\n\"to show title and ownership in the same.\" The husband's possession\r\nof property is evidence of his title to it; not so with the wife\r\n(Purd. Dig., 1,010, 38, 39; 4 Lansing, 164; 61 Barb., 145).\r\n\r\nA married woman may devise her separate property by will, subject,\r\nhowever, to the husband's curtesy, which in Pennsylvania attaches,\r\nthough there be no issue born alive, and which she cannot bar\r\n(Purd. Dig., 806, 804; I Pars., 489; 26 Penn.

It is also barred by a divorce obtained by her on the ground\r\nof his adultery, and in case of such divorce she is entitled to the\r\nvalue of one-half of the money and property which the husband\r\nreceived through her at marriage (Purd. Dig., 514; 2 Dall. 127; 12\r\nSerg. and R., 21; I Yeates Pa., 300).\r\n\r\nA single woman's will is revoked by her subsequent marriage, and is\r\nnot again revived by the death of her husband; a single man's will\r\nis revoked by marriage absolutely only when he leaves a widow but\r\nno known heirs or kindred (Purd. Dig., 1,477, 18 and 19; 47 Penn.\r\nS. Rep., 144, 34, 483).\r\n\r\nIf the husband die intestate leaving a widow and issue, the widow\r\nshall have one-third of his and their joint personalty absolutely,\r\nand one-third of the real estate for life; if there are no\r\nchildren, but collateral heirs, she is entitled to the use of\r\none-half the realty, including the mansion-house, for her life, and\r\none-half the personalty absolutely (Purd. Dig., 806, 2 and 3; Act\r\nof 1833, 1).\r\n\r\nIf the wife die intestate leaving a husband and no issue, he is\r\nentitled to her entire personalty and realty during his life; if\r\nthere are children her personal estate is divided between the\r\nhusband and children share and share alike; in either case he is\r\nentitled to their entire joint estate (Purd. Dig., 806, 5; Act of\r\n1848, 9).\r\n\r\nMarried women may be corporate members of any institution composed\r\nof and managed by women, having as its object the care and\r\neducation of children or the support of sick and indigent women\r\n(Purd.

He is capable of all the offices of\r\nthe government from that of postmaster to the presidency, and of\r\ntransacting all kinds of business from the measuring of tape to the\r\npractice of the most learned professions. Woman, deprived of\r\npolitical power, is limited in opportunities for education, and, if\r\nmarried, is incapable of making a contract; hence crippled in the\r\ntransaction of any kind of business.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nINDIANA.\r\n\r\n[A.]\r\n\r\nGovernor Porter made the following novel appointment: On August 30,\r\n1882, Mrs. Georgia A. Ruggles, from Bartholomew county, presented\r\nto Governor Porter an application for a requisition from the\r\ngovernor of Indiana upon the governor of Kansas, for William J.\r\nBeck, charged with the crime of bigamy. Beck had been living a few\r\nmonths in Bartholomew county and had passed as an unmarried man;\r\nhad gained the affections of a young lady much younger than himself\r\nand much superior to him by birth and education. After their\r\nmarriage the fact that Beck had already one wife became known and\r\nhe fled to Kansas. Mrs. Ruggles was a friend to the young lady who\r\nhad been thus duped, and upon learning the facts she called the\r\nattention of the proper authorities to the matter, and begged them\r\nto effect Beck's arrest. They were not disposed to do so, and upon\r\nvarious excuses postponed action. She therefore determined to take\r\nthe matter into her own hands. Governor Porter granted her the\r\ndesired requisition; she went to Kansas, and on September 10, 1882,\r\nshe received Beck from Samuel Hamilton, sheriff of Ellsworth\r\ncounty; she herself brought the prisoner, in cuffs, to Indiana,\r\nand, September 13, she delivered him into the hands of Thomas E.\r\nBurgess, sheriff of Bartholomew county. Beck was tried, convicted\r\nand sent to the penitentiary. This bit of justice was the fruit of\r\na woman's pluck and a governor's good sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM GEN. COBURN'S ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nThe people expect that they will in their own way and time\r\ninaugurate such measures as will bring these questions in their\r\nentire magnitude into the arena. I hope to see 10,000 women in\r\nconvention here. They can, if they will, create a public sentiment\r\nin favor of their enfranchisement that will be irresistible. They\r\nhave the ears of the voters; they have access to the columns of the\r\nnewspapers; they control all the avenues of social life. What can\r\nthey not accomplish, if, with their whole hearts they set about it?\r\nThe sphere of public life has many vacant places to be filled by\r\nwomen. Why shall they not serve upon the boards of trustees of our\r\ngreat reformatory and benevolent institutions, as superintendents\r\nin our hospitals, and as directors and inspectors in our prisons?\r\nThe last legislature conferred upon them the right to hold any\r\noffice in our great school system except one, that of State\r\nsuperintendent of public instruction. From them may now be\r\nselected, president of the State university, or of the Normal\r\nSchool, or of Purdue University, school commissioners and county\r\nsuperintendents. But the legislature should give them the power to\r\nrescue our prisons, hospitals and asylums from the indescribable\r\nhorror of filth, neglect and cruelty which hangs like a murky cloud\r\nover many of them. Men have tried it and failed. Stupidity or\r\npartisanship or brutality or avarice, has transformed many a noble\r\nfoundation of benevolence into a hell of abomination. Some one must\r\nstep in to inspect; to enforce order, cleanliness and virtue; to\r\nbring comfort and hope to the downcast and to the outcast of\r\nsociety. This purpose must be backed up by the strong arm of power,\r\nby the sanction of the law, and that law must have upon it the\r\nstamp of woman's intellect. This year the women of Indiana can\r\nplace themselves in the van of human progress and dictate the\r\npolicy which mankind must recognize as just and true for ages to\r\ncome. The public mind is not unprepared for this measure. The\r\nspread and the acceptance of great ideas is almost miraculous in\r\nintelligent communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n[B.]\r\n\r\nLEGAL OPINION BY W. D. WALLACE, ESQ., UPON THE POWER OF THE\r\nLEGISLATURE TO AUTHORIZE WOMEN TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS.\r\n\r\n_Capt. W. DeWitt Wallace, Attorney-at-law, Lafayette, Ind.:_\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: You will confer a favor upon the friends of woman\r\nsuffrage in Indiana, if you will send me, in writing, your opinion,\r\nas a lawyer, in answer to the following question, giving your\r\nreasons therefor: Can the legislature of this State empower women\r\nto vote for presidential electors?\r\n\r\n                               MARY F. THOMAS, _President I. W. S. A._\r\n\r\n_Richmond, Ind._, December 30, 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      LAFAYETTE, Ind., January 5, 1881.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Mary F. Thomas, President of Indiana Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation, Richmond, Indiana:_\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM: In your favor of the 30th ult., you ask my opinion\r\nupon, to me, a novel and most interesting question, viz.: \"Can the\r\nlegislature empower women to vote for presidential electors?\" After\r\nthe most careful consideration which I have been able to give to\r\nthe subject, consistent with other duties, and with the aid of such\r\nbooks as I have at command, I answer your question in the\r\naffirmative. The grounds of my opinion I will proceed to state:\r\nSection 1, article 2, of the Constitution of the United States,\r\nwhich provides that the president and vice-president shall be\r\nchosen by electors appointed by the several States, declares in\r\nthe following words how said electors shall be appointed:\r\n\r\n     Each State shall appoint in such manner as the legislature\r\n     thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole\r\n     number of senators and representatives to which said State may be\r\n     entitled in the congress, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nNow, in the absence of any provision in the State constitution,\r\nlimiting or attempting to limit the discretion of the legislature\r\nas to the manner in which the presidential electors shall be\r\nchosen, there can be no doubt but that the legislature could\r\nempower female, as well as male, citizens to participate in the\r\nchoice of presidential electors.\r\n\r\nSection 2, article 2 of our State constitution is as follows: In\r\nall elections, not otherwise provided for by this constitution,\r\nevery white male citizen of the United States, of the age of\r\ntwenty-one years, and upwards, who shall have resided in the State\r\nduring the six months immediately preceding such election * * * *\r\nshall be entitled to vote in the township or precinct where he may\r\nreside.\r\n\r\nTwo questions at once suggest themselves upon the reading of this\r\nsection: _First_--Does the section apply to elections of\r\npresidential electors, and thus become a limitation upon the\r\ndiscretion of the legislature in case it shall direct the\r\nappointment of the electors by a popular vote? _Second_--If so, can\r\na State constitution thus limit the discretion which the\r\nConstitution of the United States directs shall be exercised by the\r\nlegislature? I shall consider the last question first.\r\n\r\nWhile the legislature is created by the State, all its powers are\r\nnot derived from, nor are all its duties enjoined by the State. The\r\nmoment the State brings the legislature into being, that moment\r\ncertain duties enjoined, and certain powers conferred, by the\r\nnation, attach to it. Among the powers and duties of the\r\nlegislature, which spring from the national constitution, is the\r\npower and duty of determining how the State shall appoint\r\npresidential electors. The Constitution of the United States\r\ndeclares in the most explicit terms that the State shall do this\r\n\"in such manner as the legislature may direct.\" In the case of\r\n_Ex-Parte_ Henry E. Hayne, _et al._, reported in volume 9, at page\r\n106, of the Chicago Legal News, the Circuit Court of the United\r\nStates for the district of South Carolina, in speaking of the\r\nauthority upon which a State legislature acts in providing for the\r\nappointment of presidential electors, says:\r\n\r\nSection 1, article 2 of the constitution provides that electors\r\nshall be appointed in such manner as the legislature of each State\r\nmay direct. When the legislature of a State, in obedience to that\r\nprovision, has, by law, directed the manner of appointment of the\r\nelectors, that law has its authorities solely from the Constitution\r\nof the United States. It is a law passed in pursuance of the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nHon. James A. Garfield, who was a member of the Electoral\r\nCommission, in discussing before that body the source of the power\r\nto appoint electors, said:\r\n\r\n     The constitution prescribes that States only shall choose\r\n     electors. * * * To speak more accurately, I should say that the\r\n     power is placed in the legislatures of the States; for if the\r\n     constitution of any State were silent upon the subject, its\r\n     legislature is none the less armed with plenary authority\r\n     conferred upon it directly by the national\r\n     constitution.--[Electoral Commission, p. 242.\r\n\r\nThat this section of the national constitution has always been\r\nunderstood to lodge an absolute discretion in the legislature, is\r\nproved by the practice in the different States. Chief Justice\r\nStory, in his \"Commentaries on the Constitution of the United\r\nStates,\" in speaking of this section of the constitution and the\r\npractice under it, says:\r\n\r\n     Under this authority, the appointment of electors has been\r\n     variously provided for by the State legislatures. In some States\r\n     the legislatures have directly chosen the electors by themselves;\r\n     in others they have been chosen by the people by a general ticket\r\n     throughout the whole State, and in others by the people in\r\n     electoral districts fixed by the legislature, a certain number of\r\n     electors being apportioned to each district. No question has ever\r\n     arisen as to the constitutionality of either mode, except that of\r\n     a direct choice by the legislature. But this, though often\r\n     doubted by able and ingenious minds, has been firmly established\r\n     in practice ever since the adoption of the constitution, and does\r\n     not now seem to admit of controversy, even if a suitable tribunal\r\n     existed to adjudicate upon it.--[2 Story on Constitution, section\r\n     1,472.\r\n\r\nJudge Strong, one of the justices of the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, and a member of the electoral commission, in\r\ndiscussing the subject of this section, says:\r\n\r\n     I doubt whether they [the framers of the national constitution]\r\n     had in mind at all [in adopting this section] the idea of a\r\n     popular election as a mode of appointing State electors. They\r\n     used the word _appoint_, doubtless thinking that the legislatures\r\n     of the States would themselves select the electors, or empower\r\n     the governor or some other State officer to select them. The word\r\n     appoint is not the most appropriate word for describing the\r\n     result of a popular election. Such a mode of appointment, I\r\n     submit is allowable, but there is little reason to think it was\r\n     contemplated. * * * It was not until years afterward that the\r\n     electors were chosen by vote.--[Electoral Commission, p. 252.\r\n\r\nSenator Frelinghuysen, also a member of the Electoral Commission,\r\nthus speaks of the practice in the several States:\r\n\r\n     Under this power [the power given by the section of the national\r\n     constitution, which we are now considering] the legislature might\r\n     direct that the electors should be appointed by the legislature,\r\n     by the executive, by the judiciary, or by the people. In the\r\n     earliest days of the republic, electors were appointed by the\r\n     legislatures. In Pennsylvania they were appointed by the\r\n     judiciary. Now, in all the States except Colorado, they are\r\n     appointed by the people.--[Electoral Commission, p. 204.\r\n\r\nIf then it be true that the power to determine how the presidential\r\nelectors shall be appointed is derived from the national\r\nconstitution, and that power is a discretionary one, to be\r\nexercised in such manner as the legislature may direct, how can it\r\nbe said that a State constitution can limit or control the\r\nlegislative discretion? If the State can limit that discretion in\r\none respect it can limit it in another, and in another, and in\r\nanother, until it may shut up the legislature to but a single mode\r\nof appointment, which is to take away, and absolutely destroy all\r\nits discretion, and this is nullification, pure and simple. One of\r\nthe questions before the electoral commission in the case of South\r\nCarolina, was whether the electoral vote of that State should not\r\nbe rejected because the legislature, in providing for the\r\nappointment of the electors, had failed to obey a requirement of\r\nthe State constitution in regard to a registry law. This raised, in\r\nprinciple, the very question we are now considering, and on that\r\nquestion Senator O. P. Morton, who was a member of the commission,\r\nand who was an able lawyer as well as a great statesman, thus\r\nexpressed himself:\r\n\r\n     They [the presidential electors] are to be appointed in the\r\n     manner prescribed by the legislature of the State, and not by the\r\n     constitution of the State. The manner of the appointment of\r\n     electors has been placed by the Constitution of the United States\r\n     in the legislature of each State, and cannot be taken from that\r\n     body by the provisions of a State constitution. * * * The power\r\n     to appoint electors by a State, is conferred by the Constitution\r\n     of the United States, and does not spring from a State\r\n     constitution, and cannot be impaired or controlled by a State\r\n     constitution.--[Electoral Commission, p. 200.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished lawyer and statesman [Hon. William Lawrence] who\r\nmade the principle argument before the commission in favor of\r\nadmitting the vote of the State, took the same ground (Electoral\r\nCommission, p. 186).\r\n\r\nThe opinion of Justice Story, expressed in the Massachusetts\r\nconstitutional convention of 1820, on a very similar question, and\r\none involving the same principle, quoted by Mr. Lawrence in his\r\nargument, is very high authority, and I reproduce it here. He\r\n(Justice Story) said:\r\n\r\n     The question then was whether we have a right to insert in our\r\n     constitution a provision which controls or destroys a discretion\r\n     which may be, nay _must_ be, exercised by the legislature in\r\n     _virtue_ of _powers confided_ to it by the Constitution of the\r\n     United States. The fourth section of the first article of the\r\n     Constitution of the United States declares that the times, places\r\n     and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives\r\n     shall be prescribed by the legislature thereof. Here an express\r\n     provision was made for the manner of choosing representatives by\r\n     the State legislatures. They have an _unlimited_ discretion on\r\n     the subject. They may provide for an election in districts\r\n     sending more than one, or by general ticket for the whole State.\r\n     Here is a general discretion, a power of choice. What is the\r\n     proposition on the table? It is to limit the discretion, to leave\r\n     no choice to the legislature, to compel representatives to be\r\n     chosen in districts; in other words to compel them to be chosen\r\n     in a specific manner, excluding all others. Were not this plainly\r\n     a violation of the constitution? Does it not affect to control\r\n     the legislature in the exercise of its powers? * * * It assumes a\r\n     control over the legislature, which the Constitution of the\r\n     United States does not justify. It is bound to exercise its\r\n     authority according to its _own view_ of _public policy_ and\r\n     _principle_; and yet this proposition compels it to surrender all\r\n     discretion. In my humble judgment * * * it is a direct and\r\n     palpable infringement of the constitutional provisions to which I\r\n     have referred.--[Electoral Commission, p. 186.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion seems irresistible that a State constitution cannot\r\ndetermine for the legislature who shall, or shall not, participate\r\nin the choice of presidential electors, and that in so far as our\r\nState constitution may attempt to do so, it is an infringement of\r\nthe national constitution. The discretion of the legislature, by\r\nvirtue of the supreme law of the land, being (except in so far as\r\nit is controlled by the national constitution itself) thus\r\nabsolutely unlimited, it may, without doubt, as I think, authorize\r\nall citizens without regard to sex, to participate in the choice of\r\npresidential electors. But it has been suggested to me that\r\npossibly by the State legislature, as used in the section of the\r\nnational constitution which we have been considering, was meant the\r\nwhole people of the State in whom the legislative power originally\r\nresides and not the organized legislative body which they may\r\ncreate. We answer first that the language of the section will not\r\nadmit of this construction. It clearly recognizes a distinction\r\nbetween the State or the people of the State, and its legislature.\r\nThe language is not \"each State shall appoint in such manner as\r\n_it_ may direct,\" etc., but it is, \"each State shall appoint in\r\nsuch manner as the _legislature_ thereof may direct,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is a familiar canon of construction that in determining\r\nthe meaning of a statute, recourse may be had to the history of the\r\ntimes in which it was enacted. When the Constitution of the United\r\nStates was framed, all of the States had organized legislatures, or\r\nrepresentative bodies who wielded the legislative power, and\r\nwithout doing violence to language, we must suppose that it was to\r\n_them_ the constitution referred. Again, the State legislatures are\r\nreferred to not less than ten times in the national constitution,\r\nand in each instance the reference is such as to make it clear that\r\nthe organized representative bodies are intended, and in article 5\r\nthey are, in express terms, distinguished from conventions of the\r\nStates. Indeed, the fundamental idea of the American government is\r\nthat of a representative republic as opposed to a pure democracy,\r\nand it may well be doubted whether a State government, without a\r\nrepresentative legislative body of some kind, would, in the\r\nAmerican sense, be republican in form.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is apparent from the debates in the constitutional\r\nconvention which framed the constitution, and from the whole plan\r\ndevised for the election of president and vice-president, that it\r\nwas not intended by the framers of the constitution to commit\r\ndirectly to the whole people of a State the authority to determine\r\nhow the presidential electors should be chosen. Nothing seems to\r\nhave given the convention more trouble than the mode of selecting a\r\npresident. Many plans were proposed. Chief among these were:\r\nelection by congress; election by the executives of the States;\r\nelection by the people; election by the State legislatures; and\r\nelection by electors. These were presented in many forms. The\r\nconvention decided not less than three times, and once by a\r\nunanimous vote, in favor of election by the national congress, and\r\nas often reconsidered it (2 Madison Papers, pp. 770, 1,124, 1,190).\r\nThe proposition that the president should be elected directly by\r\nthe people, instead of by the national congress, received but one\r\nvote, while the proposition that he should be appointed by the\r\nState legislatures received two votes (2 Madison Papers, p. 1,124).\r\nThe most cursory examination of the debates will, I think, convince\r\nany mind that it was to the _organized_ legislature of the State,\r\nand not to the people of a State, that the framers of the\r\nconstitution intended to commit the power of determining how the\r\npresidential electors should be chosen. It seems, both from the\r\ndebates and the plan adopted, to have been their studied effort to\r\nprevent the people from acting in the choice of their chief\r\nmagistrate otherwise than through their representatives, and in no\r\nsingle step of the process are the people directly required or\r\nauthorized by the national constitution to act, but in every\r\ninstance the duty and the authority are devolved upon their\r\nrepresentatives. For these reasons I think it clear that it was\r\nintended to invest the organized State legislatures with the power\r\nof determining how the presidential electors should be chosen, and\r\nthat the discretion thus lodged in the legislature cannot be\r\nlimited or controlled by a State constitution.\r\n\r\n                                             W. DE WITT WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[C.]\r\n\r\nIn 1868, the Indiana (Friends) Yearly Meeting appointed Mrs. Sarah\r\nJ. Smith of Indianapolis, and Mrs. Rhoda M. Coffin of Richmond, to\r\nvisit the prisons of the State, with a view to ascertain the spirit\r\nof the management of these institutions, and the moral condition of\r\ntheir inmates. In obedience to this appointment the two ladies\r\nvisited both of the State prisons of Indiana, and made a\r\nparticularly thorough examination of the condition of the Southern\r\nprison (at Jeffersonville) where all our women convicts were kept.\r\nHere they found the vilest immoralities being practiced; they\r\ndiscovered that the rumors which had induced their appointment were\r\nfar surpassed by the revolting facts.\r\n\r\nThey visited Gov. Conrad Baker and urged him to recommend the\r\nGeneral Assembly to make an appropriation for a separate prison for\r\nwomen. With the full sympathy of Governor Baker, who was not only a\r\nmost honorable gentleman, but a sincere believer in the equal\r\npolitical rights of women, Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Coffin appeared\r\nbefore the legislature of 1869, and by an unvarnished account of\r\nwhat they had witnessed and learned in the Southern prison, they\r\naroused the legislators to immediate action, and an act to\r\nestablish a \"Reformatory Institution for Women and Girls\" was\r\npassed at that session (viz., that of 1869). By statute the new\r\ninstitution was located at Indianapolis. It was opened in 1873, the\r\nfirst separate prison for women in this country. Mrs. Sarah J.\r\nSmith was made its first superintendent, and she retained that\r\noffice, discharging all its duties with great ability, until 1883,\r\nwhen upon her resignation she was succeeded by Mrs. Elmina S.\r\nJohnson, who had up to that time been associated with Mrs. Smith as\r\nassistant superintendent.\r\n\r\nThe first managing board of women consisted of Mrs. Eliza C.\r\nHendricks (wife of Hon. Thomas A. Hendricks who was governor of\r\nIndiana on the opening of the prison), Mrs. Rhoda M. Coffin and\r\nMrs. Emily A. Roach. The changes upon the board have been so\r\ninfrequent that in addition to those on the first board and to\r\nthose on the board at present, only three ladies can be mentioned\r\nin this connection, viz.: Mrs. Eliza S. Dodd of Indianapolis, Mrs.\r\nMary E. Burson (a banker of Muncie) and Mrs. Sarah J. Smith, who,\r\nafter resigning the superintendency, served on the board for a\r\nbrief time.\r\n\r\nThe board at present consists of Mrs. Eliza C. Hendricks,\r\npresident, Mrs. Claire A. Walker and Mrs. M. M. James. From the\r\nopening of this institution Mrs. Hendricks has been connected with\r\nit; first as a member of the advisory board, for eight years a\r\nmember of the managing board and during a large part of the time\r\nits president, she has served its interest with singular fidelity.\r\nThe position is no sinecure. The purchasing of all the supplies is\r\nonly a part of the board's work; the business meetings are held\r\nmonthly and often occupy half a day, sometimes an entire day. These\r\nMrs. Hendricks always attends whether she is in Indianapolis or in\r\nWashington; from the latter point she has many times journeyed in\r\nweather most inclement by heat and by cold, simply to look after\r\nthe prison and to transact the business for it imposed by her\r\nposition on its board. During the last eight years, since women\r\nhave had control of its affairs, Miss Anna Dunlop of Indianapolis\r\nhas served the institution as its secretary and treasurer. Perhaps\r\nthe highest tribute that can be paid to the ability with which Miss\r\nDunlop has discharged the responsible and complicated duties of her\r\ndouble office, lies in the fact that with the General Assembly of\r\nthe State it has passed into a proverb that \"The Woman's\r\nReformatory is the best and most economically managed of the State\r\ninstitutions.\" The committees appointed to visit the penal\r\ninstitutions always report that \"The accounts of the reformatory\r\nare kept so accurately that its financial status can always be\r\nunderstood at a glance.\"\r\n\r\nThis institution has two distinct departments, the penal and the\r\nreformatory, occupying two sides of one main building and joined\r\nunder one management. Convicts above sixteen years of age are\r\nranked as women and confined in the penal department; those under\r\nsixteen years are accounted girls (children) and lodged in the\r\nreformatory department.\r\n\r\nThe average number of girls in the institution from its opening has\r\nbeen 150; the number of women 45. There are now (July, 1885,) over\r\n200 inmates.\r\n\r\nAll of the work of the institution is done by its inmates. A school\r\nis maintained in the building for the children; a few trades are\r\ntaught the girls; all are taught housework, laundry work, plain\r\nsewing and mending; the greatest pains is taken to form in the\r\ninmates habits of industry and personal tidiness, and to prepare\r\nthem to be good servants; and when their period of incarceration\r\nhas expired, the ladies interest themselves in finding homes and\r\nemployment for the discharged convicts whom they seek to restore to\r\nnormal relations to society. The secretary estimates that of those\r\nwho have been discharged from the institution during the last\r\ntwelve years, fully seventy-five per cent. have been really\r\nrestored and are leading honest and industrious lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n[D.]\r\n\r\nGOV. PORTER'S BIENNIAL MESSAGE, 1883: \"I recommend that in the\r\ndepartment for women in this hospital it shall be required by law\r\nthat at least one of the physicians shall be a woman. There are now\r\nin this State not a few women who bear diplomas from respectable\r\nmedical colleges, and who are qualified by professional attainments\r\nand experience to fill places as physicians in public institutions\r\nwith credit and usefulness. It would be peculiarly fit that their\r\nservices should be sought in cases of insanity among members of\r\ntheir own sex.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[E.]\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1867, Miss Lucinda B. Jenkins, formerly of Wayne\r\ncounty, Indiana, left her work among the \"Freedmen\" in the South,\r\nto accept the position of matron in \"The Soldiers' Orphans' Home\"\r\nat Knightstown, Indiana. She afterwards became the wife of Dr.\r\nWishard, the superintendent; and when the office was vacated by his\r\ndeath, she was authorized to assume his responsibilities, and\r\nperform his duties, with the exception of receipting bills and\r\ndrawing appropriations, which latter duties, not being then\r\nconsidered as within the province of a woman, were delegated to the\r\nsteward until the doctor's successor could be legally appointed.\r\n\r\nShe was a lady of intelligence and true moral worth, possessing a\r\ndignified, pleasing manner, and other good qualities, which, with\r\nher long experience as co-manager of the institution, admirably\r\nfitted her for the position of superintendent; but she was a woman,\r\nwithout a vote or political influence, and it was necessary that\r\n\"party debts\" should be paid. She therefore continued her influence\r\nfor the good of the institution without public recognition until\r\n1882, when she left to take charge of a private orphan asylum under\r\nthe management of ladies of Indianapolis.\r\n\r\n\r\n[F.]\r\n\r\nMiss Susan Fussell is the daughter of the late Dr. B. Fussell of\r\nPhiladelphia, to whom, with his estimable wife, women are indebted\r\nas the founder of the first medical college for women in the United\r\nStates. At that period of our civil war, when women were admitted\r\nto the hospitals as nurses, Miss Fussell was at her brother's home\r\nat Pendleton, Indiana. She immediately volunteered her services,\r\nand was assigned to duty by the Indiana sanitary commission in the\r\nmilitary hospitals in Louisville, Kentucky, where she served\r\nfaithfully until the close of the war, giving the bloom of her\r\nyouth to her country without hope of reward other than that which\r\ncomes to all as the result of self-sacrificing devotion to the\r\ncause of humanity.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war she returned to Philadelphia, but learning\r\nsoon that an effort was being made to induce the State of Indiana\r\nto provide a home for the soldiers' orphans, she again offered her\r\nservices in any useful capacity in that work. A benevolent\r\ngentleman of Indianapolis who had been most urgent in calling the\r\nattention of the officers of the State to their duty in that\r\nmatter, finding that there was no hope, offered to furnish Miss\r\nFussell with the money necessary to clothe, rear, educate and care\r\nfor a family of ten orphans of soldiers, and bring them up to\r\nmaturity, if she would furnish the motherly love, the years of hard\r\nlabor and self-sacrifice, the sleepless nights and endless patience\r\nneeded for the work. After a few days of prayerful consideration\r\nshe accepted, and in the fall of 1865 ten orphans were gathered\r\ntogether in Indianapolis from various parts of the State from among\r\nthose who had no friends able or willing to care for them. In the\r\nspring of 1866 they were removed to the Soldiers' Home near\r\nKnightstown, where a small cottage and garden were assigned to\r\ntheir use. In 1875, she placed the older boys in houses where their\r\ngrowing strength could be better utilized, and moved with the girls\r\nand younger boys to Spiceland to secure the benefit of better\r\nschools. In 1877, all of the ten but one were self-supporting, and\r\nhave since taken useful and respectable positions in society. The\r\none exception was a little feeble-minded boy, who, with his\r\nbrother, had been found in the county poor-house; his condition and\r\nwants very soon impressed her with the necessity for a State home\r\nfor feeble-minded children in Indiana, it having been found\r\nnecessary to send this boy to another State to be educated.\r\nHe is now in a neighboring State institution, and is almost\r\nself-supporting. With her usual energy and directness, she went to\r\nwork to gather statistics on the subject of \"Feeble-minded\r\nChildren\" in this and other States, and to interest others in their\r\nwelfare. She at last found an active co-worker in Charles Hubbard,\r\nthe representative from Henry county in the legislature, and their\r\nunited efforts, aided by other friends of the cause, secured in\r\n1876 the enactment of the law establishing the Home for\r\nFeeble-minded Children, now in operation near Knightstown, Indiana.\r\n\r\nHaving seen all her children well provided for, she began to look\r\nfor further work, and soon conceived the idea of taking the\r\nchildren from the county poor-houses of the State and forming them\r\ninto families. She offered to take the children in the Henry county\r\npoor-house and provide for them home, food, clothing and education,\r\nfor the small sum of twenty-five cents per day for each child,\r\nwhich her experience had proven to be the smallest sum that would\r\naccomplish the good she desired; but the county commissioners would\r\nonly allow her twenty cents per day. She accepted their terms,\r\nfurnishing the deficit from her own means, and so earnest was she\r\nand so completely did she demonstrate the superiority of her plan\r\nfor the care of these children, that she interested many others in\r\nthe work, and the result was the passage of a law by the\r\nlegislature of 1880-1881, giving to county commissioners the right\r\nto place their destitute children under the care of a matron,\r\ngiving her sole charge of them and full credit for her work, and\r\nproviding for her salary and their support. Under that law Miss\r\nFussell now has all the destitute children of Henry county under\r\nher care, and has created a model orphans' home. Thus has this one\r\nwoman been a power for good, and by following in the direct line of\r\nher duty, has been obliged to \"meddle in the affairs of State\" and\r\nto influence legislation.\r\n\r\nIf in giving this sketch we have exceeded the limits allotted us,\r\nlet us remember that our subject represents thousands of noble\r\nwomen who care rather that their light shall carry with it comfort\r\nand warmth, than be noted for its brilliancy, and who, having no\r\nvoice in the government, are obliged to work out their beneficent\r\nideas with much unnecessary labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n[G.]\r\n\r\nThe friends of woman's equality addressed the following petition to\r\neach member of the State legislature:\r\n\r\nBeing personally acquainted with Mrs. SARAH A. OREN, and knowing\r\nher to be a woman of refinement and culture, we can consistently\r\nurge upon you a favorable consideration of her claims as a\r\ncandidate for election to the office of State librarian. She has\r\nhad the benefit of a collegiate education, and has been for several\r\nyears a successful teacher in Antioch College and in the public\r\nhigh-school of Indianapolis. She is mainly dependent on her own\r\nlabor for the means to support and educate her children, who were\r\n_made fatherless by a rebel bullet_ at the siege of Petersburg. Her\r\neducation and experience have admirably fitted her for the\r\ndischarge of all the duties of the office of State librarian; and\r\nby electing her to that office, the Republican party will secure a\r\nfaithful and efficient officer, and have the pleasure of making\r\nanother payment on the debt we owe to the widows and orphans of\r\nthose who died that our country might live.[586]\r\n\r\nMrs. Oren was elected to the office of State librarian and\r\nperformed the duties belonging to it with great efficiency and\r\nfidelity. She has been succeeded by Mrs. Margaret Peele, Mrs. Emma\r\nA. Winsor and Miss Lizzie H. Callis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nMINNESOTA.\r\n\r\n[A.]\r\n\r\nIn the early days, long before the organization of either State or\r\nlocal societies, there were, besides those mentioned in the main\r\nchapter, a few earnest women who were ever ready to subscribe for\r\nsuffrage papers and circulate tracts and petitions to congress and\r\nthe State legislature, whose names should be honored with at least\r\na mention on the page of history. Among them were: Mrs. Addie\r\nBallou, Mrs. Ellis White, Mrs. Eliza Dutcher, Mrs. Sarah Clark,\r\nMiss Amelia Heebner, Miss Emily A. Emerson, Mrs. Mary F. Mead, Mrs.\r\nE. M. O'Brien, Miss Ellen C.

A., Mrs. Augusta Norwood\r\nSmith, Matilda J. Campbell, B. L., Maria L. Sanford.\r\n\r\nAmong the teachers in the normal schools of the State are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n_Winona_--Martha Brechbill, Sophia L. Haight, Jennie Ellis, Sarah\r\nE. Whittaker, Kate L. Sprague, Vienna Dodge, Ada L. Mitchell, Anna\r\nC. Foekens, Rena M. Mead, Mary E. Couse, B. S.\r\n\r\n_Mankato Normal School_--Helen M. Philips, Defransa A. Swan, Anna\r\nMcCutcheon, Genevieve S. Hawley, Mary E. Hutcheson, Eliza A.\r\nCheney, Charity A. Green, M. Adda Holton.\r\n\r\n_St. Cloud Normal School_--Isabel Lawrence, Ada A. Warner, Minnie\r\nF. Wheelock, Rose A. Joclin, Mary L. Wright, Kittie W. Allen.\r\nNearly all of the above-named teachers were graduated from Eastern\r\ncolleges and universities.\r\n\r\nWomen occupy the same positions as men and receive corresponding\r\nsalaries. A recent report of Minneapolis schools names fifteen\r\nwomen in the High School receiving from $650 to $900 per year;\r\ntwelve principals of ward schools, receiving from $750 to $1,000;\r\nand eleven primary principals receiving from $650 to $800. At St.\r\nPaul there were reported two principals getting $1,200 each, two\r\ngetting $900, and twelve others getting $600 each; of the five lady\r\nassistants in the High School, one received $900, one $800, and\r\nthree received $700 each. The principal of the High School at\r\nDuluth receives $750 per annum, and some of the assistants and\r\nprincipals of ward schools, $600.\r\n\r\nMiss Sarah E. Sprague, a graduate of St. Lawrence University, and\r\nof the Normal and Training School at Oswego, N. Y., has been\r\nemployed since August, 1884, by the State Department of Public\r\nInstruction, for institute work, at a salary of $1,260 per year and\r\nexpenses. Miss Sprague is a lady of rare ability and an honor to\r\nher profession.\r\n\r\nProminent among private schools for young ladies is the Bennett\r\nSeminary at Minneapolis, Mrs. B. B. Bennett, principal; also the\r\nWasioja Seminary, Mrs. C. B. P. Lang, preceptress, and Miss M. V.\r\nPaine, instructor in music. The services of Miss Mary E. Hutcheson\r\nhave been highly valued as instructor in vocal music and elocution\r\nin the Mankato Normal School. Miss Florence Barton at Minneapolis,\r\nMrs. Emily Moore of Duluth, are excellent teachers of music, and\r\nMiss Zella D'Unger, of elocution.\r\n\r\nProminent among the kindergarten schools is that of Mrs. D. V. S.\r\nBrown at St. Paul; Mrs. Mary Dowse, Duluth; Miss Endora Hailman,\r\nWinona. The latter is director of the kindergarten connected with\r\nthe Winona State Normal School. Miss Fannie Wood, Miss Kate E.\r\nBarry, Miss Ella P. McWhorter and Miss Abby E. Axtell, are reported\r\nas having rendered very efficient service as teachers in the State\r\nDeaf and Dumb Asylum; Miss Mary Kirk, Miss Alice Mott and Miss Emma\r\nL. Rohow are spoken of as having been earnest and devoted teachers\r\nin the State Institution for the Blind.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viola Fuller Miner of Minneapolis, graduated from the State\r\nUniversity, has long been known as a teacher and writer of much\r\nability. Her pen never touches the suffrage question except to its\r\nadvantage. Miss Eloise Butler, teaching in the High School of the\r\nsame city, would gladly have lent her personal aid to suffrage work\r\nhad time and strength permitted. We have at least the blessing of\r\nher membership and influence. Mrs. Sadie Martin, likewise a teacher\r\nof advanced classes and an easy writer, will be remembered as the\r\nfirst president of the local suffrage society of Minneapolis, and\r\none much devoted to its interests. Mrs. Maggie McDonald, formerly a\r\nteacher at Rochester and long a resident of St. Paul, has ever been\r\na devoted friend of the suffrage cause--commenced work as long ago\r\nas '69, and is to-day unflagging in hope and zeal. Mrs. Caroline\r\nNolte of the same city, though much occupied as a teacher in the\r\nHigh School, still found time to aid in forming the St. Paul\r\nSuffrage Society. Miss Helen M. McGowan, a teacher at Owatonna, is\r\nspoken of as \"a grand woman who believes in the ballot as a means\r\nto higher ends.\" Miss S. A. Mayo, a lady of fine culture and a\r\nsuccessful teacher of elocution, was also an active member of this\r\nsociety while in the city. Miss Clara M. Coleman, a classical\r\nscholar from Michigan University, for one year principal of the\r\nDuluth High School, was a believer in equal rights for all and did\r\nnot hesitate to say so. Miss Louise Hollister, a graduate of the\r\nMinnesota University, is Miss Coleman's successor and a friend of\r\nsuffrage for women, with an educational qualification; she is\r\nvice-president of the Equal Rights League of Duluth. Miss Jenny\r\nLind Gowdy, graduated from the Winona Normal School, is an\r\nexcellent primary principal who teaches her pupils that girls\r\nshould have the same rights and privileges as boys--no more, no\r\nless.\r\n\r\n\r\n[E.]\r\n\r\nThe names of the women who have been admitted to the Minnesota\r\nState Medical Society are: Clara E. Atkinson, Ida Clark, Mary G.\r\nHood, A. M. Hunt, Harriet E. Preston, Belle M. Walrath, Annes F.\r\nWass, Lizzie R. Wass, Mary Twoddy Whetsone.\r\n\r\nAmong the women who have practiced medicine in Minnesota are:\r\nCatharine Underwood Jewell, Lake City; E. M. Roys, Rochester;\r\nHarriet E. Preston, M. Mason, Mary E. Emery, Jennie Fuller, Clara\r\nE. Atkinson, St. Paul; Mary G. Hood, Mary J. Twoddy Whetsone, R. C.\r\nHenderson, A. M. Hunt, Adele S. Hutchinson, Mary L. Swain, D. A.\r\nCoombe, Minneapolis; E. M. Roys, Mary Whitney, Ida S. Clark,\r\nRochester; Augusta L. Rosenthal, Winona; Fannie E. Holden, Anna\r\nBrockway Gray, Duluth.\r\n\r\nThe board of officers of the Sisters of Bethany has for many years\r\nconsisted of: _President_, Mrs. Charlotte O. Van Cleve;\r\n_Vice-President_, Mrs. Euphemia N. Overlock; _Secretary_, Mrs.\r\nHarriet G. Walker; _Treasurer_, Mrs. Abbie G. Mendenhall.\r\n\r\nThe city of Minneapolis takes the lead of all others in the State\r\nin the number of its benevolent institutions. It has its Woman's\r\nIndustrial Exchange, as an aid to business women; its Woman's Home,\r\nor pleasant boarding-house; for the care of sick women, its\r\nNorthwestern Woman's Hospital and training-school for nurses; also\r\na homeopathic hospital for women; for the care of homeless infants,\r\nits Foundlings' Home; for unfortunate girls, its Bethany Home. All\r\nof these institutions are in the hands of the best of women. Among\r\nthe most active are: Mrs. M. B. Lewis, Miss Abby Adair, Mrs. O. A.\r\nPray, Mrs. J. M. Robinson, Mrs. John Edwards, Mrs. L. Christian,\r\nMrs. S. W. Farnham, Mrs. Wm. Harrison, Mrs. H. M. Carpenter, Mrs.\r\nD. Morrison, Mrs. John Crosby, Mrs. George B. Wright, Mrs. Moses\r\nMarston, Mrs. Charlotte O. Van Cleve, Mrs. T. B. Walker, Dr. Mary\r\nS. Whetsone, Mrs. C. S. Winchell, Dr. Mary G. Hood, Mrs. R. W.\r\nJordan, Miss A. M. Henderson.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Duluth there is a woman's home unlike any other in\r\nthe State. It is managed by a corporate body of ladies known as\r\nhome missionaries. The charter members are: Sarah B. Stearns, Laura\r\nCoppernell, Jennie C. Swanstrom, Fanny H. Anthony, Olive Murphy,\r\nFlora Davey, Jennie S. Lloyd, Fannie E. Holden, M. D. The work of\r\nthis corporation is to seek out all poor women needing temporary\r\nshelter and employment. The classes chiefly cared for are poor\r\nwidows and deserted wives, and such small children as may belong to\r\nthem; also over-worked young women who may need a temporary\r\nresting-place; also young girls thrown suddenly upon their own\r\nresources without knowledge of how to care for themselves. These\r\nladies care also for the unfortunate of another class, but in a\r\nretired place, unmarked by any sign. They prefer that to the usual\r\nplan of caring for the victims of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n[F.]\r\n\r\nPortrait and landscape-painters in oil and water-colors, who give\r\npromise of success: _Minneapolis_, Miss Clara V.

Of those who have gone from Duluth, and\r\nreturned as proficients, may be named Mary Willis, Mary Ensign\r\nHunter, Mary Munger, Florence Moore and Jessie Hopkins. With this\r\nbeautiful thought in mind, \"_noblesse oblige_,\" the christian\r\nworkers of Duluth call upon these talented young ladies for aid in\r\nfurnishing many entertainments for charity's sake, and are seldom\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[G.]\r\n\r\nAmong the occasional speakers and writers not mentioned in the main\r\nchapter are: Abbie J. Spaulding, Mrs. M. M. Elliot, Miss A. M.\r\nHenderson, Mrs. M. J. Warner, Lizzie Manson, Rebecca S. Smith,\r\nViola Fuller Miner, Harriet G.

Zoe McClary, daughter of\r\nRev. and Mrs. Thomas McClary, gives promise of distinction.\r\n\r\nSince the formation of the State and local societies there are many\r\nwomen in their quiet homes who are ever ready to encourage any\r\neffort toward making all women more free, helpful and happy. Let\r\nthis paragraph record the names of a few of these: Mary E. Chute,\r\nIsabelle L. Blaisdell, Mary Partridge, Mrs. C. C. Curtis, Frances\r\nA. Shaw, Lucy E. Prescott, Mrs. S. J.

C.\r\nCalhoun, Mary F. Snow, Minnie Edwards, Mrs. O. Fuller, Mrs. C. M.\r\nParker, Wm. R. Ryder, Mrs. M. J. Hendee, Kate Collins, Mary\r\nKellogg, Louise Fowler, M. J. Hemsley and Mrs. H. T. Perry.

Layres, Miss Prince, Kate Kennedy, Carrie\r\nParker, Marion Hill,[587] Mrs. Olmstead, Mrs. Dr. White, Dr. Laura\r\nP. Williams and Mrs. Olive Washburn were all members of the city\r\nand State associations. There was the brilliant Sallie Hart, who\r\ntook such an active part in the \"local option\" contest in 1871, and\r\nwho as a newspaper reporter and correspondent in the State\r\nlegislature for two or three sessions was very active in urging the\r\nclaims of woman upon the consideration of our law-makers.\r\n\r\nHon. Philip A. Roach, often a prominent official of the State, and\r\nfor many years editor of the _Daily Examiner_, is an advocate of\r\nwoman's rights and was instrumental in getting an act, known as\r\n\"Senator Roach's bill to Punish Wife-whippers,\" passed. It provided\r\nthat such offenders should be punished by flogging upon the bare\r\nback at the whipping-post. A wise and just law, but it was\r\nafterward declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Hon.\r\nJames G. Maguire, a brilliant and rising young lawyer, a member of\r\nthe legislature in 1875, now a judge of the Superior Court of San\r\nFrancisco, is a most reliable and talented advocate of equality for\r\nwomen. Among the members of the bar and other prominent men of the\r\nState are to be found a number who are either pronounced in their\r\nviews of woman's right to vote, or are inclined to favor all\r\nmeasures tending to ameliorate woman's condition in life; of whom\r\nare Judge G. M. Clough, Judge Darwin, D. J. Murphy, Judge L. Quint,\r\nCol. J. P. Jackson of the _Daily Post_, Hon. Charles Gildea of the\r\nBoard of Equalization, Judge Toohey, the late Judge Charles Wolff,\r\nRev. Dr. F. F. Jewell, Dr. R. H. McDonald, the prominent temperance\r\nadvocate; Hon. J. T. Wharton, P. S. Dorney, esq., Judge J. B.\r\nLamar, Rev. Dr. Robert McKenzie, Capt. Walker of the _City Argus_,\r\nHon. Frank Pixley of the _Argonaut_, ex-Gov. James A. Johnson of\r\nthe _Daily Alta_, Alfred Cridge, esq., Dr. R. B. Murphy, N. Hawks,\r\nW. H. Barnes of _The Call_, O. Dearing, Hon. W. W. Marrow, Hon.\r\nCharles A. Sumner, representative in congress; Hon. J. B. Webster\r\nof the _California Patron_, in San Francisco.

Shafter of Marin county;\r\nSenator Brooks and Judge J. D. Hinds of Ventura county.\r\n\r\nSacramento county contains a large number of progressive men and\r\nwomen, though the good work has consisted mainly in the efforts\r\nmade by committees appointed by the State society to attend the\r\nbiennial sessions of the legislature, most of whom were not\r\nresidents of the county. But among those who have done good service\r\nin Sacramento, the first and most active for many years has been\r\nMrs. L. G. Waterhouse, now of Monterey. She espoused the cause in\r\nearly life, and when many added years compelled her to retire from\r\nactive service, her efforts in behalf of women were still\r\ncontinued. Miss Dr. Kellogg is not only a successful practitioner\r\nof medicine, but is gifted with eloquent speech, and has on several\r\noccasions addressed the legislature of the State; Dr. Jennie\r\nBearby, for some years a resident of Sacramento, now of Idaho, is\r\nworthy of mention; Mrs. M. J. Young, attorney-at-law since June,\r\n1879; Annie G. Cummings and daughter, have been among the earliest\r\nand most faithful adherents to our cause. Mrs. E. B. Crocker has,\r\nthrough her social position, exerted great influence in a quiet\r\nway, and has contributed liberally from her vast wealth to aid the\r\ncause; she founded the Marguerite Home for aged women. Dr. and Mrs.\r\nBowman, now of Oakland, were pioneers in this work; while Mesdames\r\nJackson, Hontoon, Perley Watson, and Miss Hattie Moore are among\r\nthe recent converts. Hon. Grove L. Johnson has been one of the most\r\neloquent of all the fearless champions of women who have occupied a\r\nseat in the legislature; Hon. Creed Haymond deserves to rank with\r\nthe foremost, as an able advocate of woman's political rights; Hon.\r\nS. J. Finney of Santa Cruz, Talbot Wallis, State Librarian, Judge\r\nTaylor, a prominent lawyer, and his brilliant wife, are also among\r\nour friends. Sarah A. Montgomery, Mattie A. Shaw, Mrs. A. Wilcox,\r\nMary B. Lewis, Judge and Mrs. McFarland, Judge J. W. Armstrong,\r\nencouraged by his devoted and talented wife, and a large number of\r\nothers, favor in a quiet way the ballot for women.\r\n\r\nSan Joaquin county has been the home of Laura De Force Gordon since\r\n1870, and much of her practice as a lawyer has been in the courts\r\nat Stockton. Among the earliest advocates of suffrage were Mr. and\r\nMrs. William Condy, Mr. and Mrs. Harry, Judge Brush, Hattie Brush,\r\nJudge Roysdon, William Hickman and wife, Mrs. E. Emery, William\r\nIsrael, Hannah Israel, Miss E. Clifford, Dr. Holden, Richard Condy\r\nand his noble wife Elizabeth, who was the first president of the\r\nSan Joaquin county society. Among a host of others are Mr. and Mrs.\r\nW. F. Freeman and their bright young daughter Sophronia, who gives\r\npromise of future usefulness in the lecture-field; Mr. and Mrs. J.\r\nC. Gage, whose daughter Hattie possesses marked artistic ability,\r\nand though still in her teens has produced oil paintings of rare\r\nbeauty; Dr. Brown, physician in charge of the State Insane Asylum;\r\nDr. Phoebe Tabor, for many years a successful medical practitioner;\r\nMrs. N. G. Cary, Mrs. M. S. Webb, Mrs. Zignago, a successful\r\nbusiness woman; Mr. and Mrs. H. B. Loomis, R. B. Lane, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nH. M. Bond, and Mr. and Mrs. W. L. Overhiser, both of whom are\r\nactive members of that liberal woman's rights order, the Patrons of\r\nHusbandry. Hon. R. C. Sargent, a member of the legislature for\r\nseveral terms, has always aided the woman's cause by his vote and\r\ninfluence. Dr. J. L. Sargent and his intelligent wife are also\r\nfriends to every measure tending to benefit woman. Hon. S. L.\r\nTerry, Senator F. T. Baldwin, James A. Lontitt, esq., Judge J. H.\r\nBudd, Judge A. Van R. Patterson, George B. McStay, Judge Buckley\r\nand a number of other prominent officials and members of the legal\r\nprofession, are all in favor of equal rights.\r\n\r\nSonoma county has a few fearless friends of woman suffrage. Mary\r\nJewett, Mrs. Prince, Fannie M. Wertz and Miss E. Merrill were\r\nofficers in the first organization formed at Healdsburg in that\r\ncounty in 1870, and together with J. G. Howell and wife, who were\r\nproprietors of the _Russian River Flag_, kept up the society for\r\nyears. At Petaluma, Mrs. A. A. Haskell, Mr. and Mrs. A. L. Hatch,\r\nKate Lovejoy and Mrs. Judge Latimer organized a society in 1869. In\r\nSolano county are Mr. and Mrs. Denio and Mrs. E. L. Hale of\r\nVallejo; Mrs. Elizabeth Ober and Mrs. Celia Geddes of Fairfield.\r\nNapa county soon became an objective point for lecturers; a society\r\nwas organized at St. Helena in 1871, with Mr. and Mrs. John\r\nLewellyn, Charles King, Mrs. Potter and Dr. and Mrs. Allyn as\r\nofficers; at Napa were Joseph Eggleton and wife and Mrs. Ellis. In\r\nSan Mateo county was Mrs. Dr. Kilpatrick. Contra Costa county was\r\norganized in 1870, and Mrs. Phebe Benedict, Mrs. Abbott, Mary\r\nO'Brien, Sarah Sellers, Dr. and Mrs. Howard, Hannah Israel, an able\r\nwriter and lecturer, and Capt. Kimball of Antioch, took an active\r\npart therein. Mrs. J. H. Chase of Martinez, E. H. Cox and wife of\r\nDanville, were pioneers in the cause, and Henry and Abigail Bush of\r\nMartinez, were most prominent in the first meetings held there.\r\nMrs. Bush had the honor to preside over the second woman suffrage\r\nconvention ever held in the United States, that at Rochester, N.\r\nY., in 1848. O. Alley and wife, also of Martinez, extended their\r\nhospitality to lecturers who visited that place, and fully\r\nsympathized in the cause.\r\n\r\nIn Marin county a society was formed in 1870, with Isabella Irwin,\r\nMrs. Barney, Flora Whitney, Mrs. M. Dubois and Mary Battey Smith,\r\nas officers; Mrs. McM. Shafter, a gifted and influential lady, was\r\nalso an active worker in the good cause. Alameda county--Rev. John\r\nBenton and wife, Professor E. Carr and wife, Mrs. C. C. Calhoun,\r\nMrs. M. L. S. Duncan, Mrs. S. S. Allen, Dr. and Mrs. Powers, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Ingersoll, Angie Eager, Mary Kenny, George and Martha\r\nParry and Mr. and Mrs. William Stevens, were interested in the\r\nearlier agitation of the question; Mrs. Sanford, Mrs. A. M.\r\nStoddard and Mrs. M. Johnson are among the later converts. Merced\r\ncounty the home of Rowena Granice Steele, the author, and publisher\r\nof the _San Joaquin Valley Argus_, has furnished the State with a\r\nworthy and capable advocate of woman suffrage, both as a speaker\r\nand writer. In her cozy, rose-embowered cottage at Merced, she\r\ngenerously entertains her numerous guests, who always seek out this\r\ndistinguished and warm-hearted friend of woman. Stanislaus county\r\nis the present home of Jennie Phelps Purvis, a talented and\r\nbrilliant woman, well known in literary circles in an early day and\r\nfor some years a prominent officer and member of the State society.\r\nAt Modesto are Mrs. Lapham and daughter Amel, and Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBrown, good friends to suffrage. In San Diego are Mrs. F. P.\r\nKingsbury, Mrs. Tallant. In Santa Cruz county, Georgiana Bruce\r\nKirby, Mrs. H. M. Blackburn, Mrs. M. E. Heacock, Rev. D. G.\r\nIngraham, Ellen Van Valkenburg.
